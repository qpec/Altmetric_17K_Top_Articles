ABSTRACT
To support food security for current and future generations, there is a need to understand the relation between sustainable diets and the health
of a population. In recent years, a number of studies have investigated and compared different dietary patterns to better understand which foods
and eating patterns have less of an environmental impact while meeting nutritional needs and promoting health. This systematic review (SR) of
population-level dietary patterns and food sustainability extends and updates the SR that was conducted by the 2015 US Dietary Guidelines
Advisory Committee, an expert committee commissioned by the federal government to inform dietary guidance as it relates to the committee’s
original conclusions. In the original SR, 15 studies met the criteria for inclusion; since then, an additional 8 studies have been identified and
included. The relations between dietary intake patterns and both health and environmental outcomes were compared across studies, with
methodologies that included modeling, life cycle assessment, and land use analysis. Across studies, consistent evidence indicated that a dietary
pattern higher in plant-based foods (e.g., vegetables, fruits, legumes, seeds, nuts, whole grains) and lower in animal-based foods (especially red
meat), as well as lower in total energy, is both healthier and associated with a lesser impact on the environment. This dietary pattern differs from
current average consumption patterns in the United States. Our updated SR confirms and strengthens the conclusions of the original US Dietary
Guidelines Advisory Committee SR, which found that adherence to several well-characterized dietary patterns, including vegetarian (with
variations) diets, dietary guidelines–related diets, Mediterranean-style diets, the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, and other
sustainable diet scenarios, promotes greater health and has a less negative impact on the environment than current average dietary intakes.

Introduction
Nutrition and food policy experts in the United States have
long been concerned with the food security of the public.
These concerns typically have been framed in the here and
now; however, as a greater understanding of the human im-
pact on the biosphere emerges, we recognize that actions
taken now affect or constrain future choices. Hence, it is im-
portant to understand how our actions (dietary patterns and
choices) in 2016 affect the potential for food security in the
future. Long-term food security can be ensured only if we
consider the sustainability of our food supply now.
Two established definitions from the FAO are relevant to
this work (1, 2). Food security exists when all people at all
times have physical and economic access to sufficient, safe,
and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food
preferences for an active, healthy life. Sustainable diets are
those diets that have low environmental impact and contrib-
ute to food and nutrition security and a healthy life for pre-
sent and future generations. Sustainable diets are protective
and respectful of biodiversity and ecosystems; culturally accept-
able; accessible; economically fair; affordable; and nutritionally
adequate, safe, and healthy while optimizing natural and human
resources.
Dietary patterns are defined as the quantities, proportions,
variety, or combinations of different foods and beverages in
diets and the frequency with which they are habitually con-
sumed (3). The current emphasis on healthy eating patterns,

 rather than individual food groups, foods, or nutrients, pro-
vides a more comprehensive approach to assess both health
and environmental outcomes related to the US diet. Consider-
able evidence exists on a priori dietary patterns that promote
health, including the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hyperten-
sion (DASH)8 diet, the Mediterranean dietary pattern
(MDP), vegetarian diets and their variations, and the Healthy
US-Style Eating Pattern (3). These patterns, consumed at an
appropriate caloric concentration, promote healthy growth
and development while reducing the risk of preventable
chronic diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, type 2 dia-
betes, obesity, and some cancers. Furthermore, these patterns
of eating promote functional health in older adults (3).
The capacity to produce enough food in the future is lim-
ited potentially by water, soil fertility, land use, and steward-
ship of seas and oceans. There is mounting evidence that the
impact of food production on the environment is consider-
able. Natural resources will be strained and may be lost to fu-
ture generations if energy, water, and land are not managed
and conserved responsibly. Looked at within a planetary
boundary framework, the food production system affects a
variety of natural resources (4). The global system is responsi-
ble for >70% of fresh water use, up to 30% of human-generated
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and 80% of deforestation
(5). Food production also is the largest contributor to the
loss of biodiversity (5). Large phosphorus flows into surface
waters from agriculture lead to the degradation of freshwater
and hypoxic zones in both freshwater and salt water (6). Pop-
ulation growth, energy costs, and climate change will continue
to strain the available natural resources while the transition in
nutrition in much of the developing world threatens to over-
whelm global food production capacity (7).
Four mutually supportive approaches are needed to meet
present and future food needs: 1) shift individual and pop-
ulation food choices and patterns, 2) implement existing and
develop new agricultural production practices that reduce eco-
logical effects and conserve resources while continuing to meet
food and nutritional needs, 3) more equitably distribute re-
sources, and 4) reduce food waste at various points in the sup-
ply chain and by consumers (8). Our analysis focuses primarily
on the first approach, examining the effect of population-level
dietary choices on sustainability.
The Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee (DGAC)
addressed this issue in the Scientific Report of the DGAC, re-
leased in February 2015 (3). All authors were either members
of or consultants to the DGAC. This systematic review (SR)
was undertaken to capture what is clearly an evolving research
base on the link between dietary patterns and environmental
outcomes. The main objective of our SR was to update the
DGAC report analysis. Our approach was to assess the align-
ment between food patterns that are nutritionally sound and
support health and those that are more environmentally sus-
tainable. Intergovernmental organizations also have used this
strategy. The FAO identified MDP as an example of a sustain-
able diet because of its smaller meat portions and emphasis on
plant-based dietary diversity, and the European Commission
supported the creation of the LiveWell for LIFE diet to pro-
mote health and reduce GHG emissions (9, 10).
Research in the area of sustainability and dietary patterns
is advancing quickly, and the methods for assessing dietary
patterns in populations and life cycle analysis (LCA) have
made substantial advances (11). The growing evidence
base for this question exemplifies this in that numerous
peer-reviewed articles have been published since the publi-
cation of the DGAC SR. To fully encompass this state-of-
the-art body of evidence, we undertook an update of the
DGAC document and assessed research published between
January 2014 and July 2015. This will help determine whether
there is further evidence supporting or contradicting the con-
clusions drawn by the 2015 DGAC SR.
Methods
An analytical framework was developed to identify the core elements of the
SR question what is the relation between population-level dietary patterns
that promote health and long-term food sustainability? In developing the
SR protocol, we used the population, intervention or exposure, comparator,
and outcomes question framework (12). These 4 components represent key
features of the subject matter that need to be considered in developing an SR
framework (Figure 1).
The original search of PubMed, Cochrane, Embase, and Navigator da-
tabases was completed in March 2014 (3). As outlined in the DGAC report,
the inclusion criteria identified original research articles published in peer-
reviewed English-language journals having subjects who were healthy or at
elevated chronic disease risk hailing from countries with high or extremely
high human development indexes. Study designs included randomized and
nonrandomized controlled trials, prospective cohort studies, cross-sectional
studies, case-control studies, and modeling studies. Studies that examined
low-calorie diets for weight loss purposes and other treatment diets were ex-
cluded. Finally, studies were required to include a description of a dietary
pattern, an associated health outcome, and sustainability or food security
outcomes. The identical inclusion criteria were used for our update of the
SR, which spanned the literature published between January 2014 and
July 2015.
The search and selection of relevant studies, data abstraction, and grad-
ing of the evidence were conducted as originally described (3). We used a
data extraction grid to compile data and environmental outcomes. A mod-
ified critical appraisal checklist was used to assess individual study quality
and risk of bias, and 2 experts in the field of food sustainability who served
as consultants to the DGAC reviewed these assessments. The critical ap-
praisal checklist is used to assess studies that use modeling to extrapolate
the progression of clinical outcomes, transform final outcomes from inter-
mediate measures, examine relations between inputs and outputs to appor-
tion resource use, and extrapolate findings from one clinical setting or
population to another. To attain a high score, studies must report the var-
iables that have been modeled rather than directly observed, which addi-
tional variables have been included or excluded, which statistical relations
have been assumed, and the evidence that supports these assumptions
(3, 13–15).

 to identify additional studies that met the inclusion criteria
and determine whether there were any substantive changes
in the science. The update identified 8 additional studies
that met the inclusion criteria (Figure 2). These additional
studies consisted mainly of dietary pattern–modeling studies
or cross-sectional diet studies that assessed related environ-
mental and health outcomes; one was a prospective cohort
study with a 16-y follow-up of the European Prospective In-
vestigation into Cancer (EPIC)–Netherlands cohort (30).
Details of the studies are presented in Table 1. These studies
were published from 2003 to 2014 in the original SR and
from 2014 to 2015 in the update. Studies were based on
populations in the United States, New Zealand, the United
Kingdom, the Netherlands, Germany, Spain, France, Italy,
Brazil, and Australia. Dietary patterns that were examined in-
cluded the average and dietary guidelines–related patterns of the
respective countries, various vegetarian patterns (e.g., lacto-
ovo vegetarian, vegan), the MDP, pescatarian, the DASH
diet, and several diets based on sustainable outcomes and/
or cost. The average dietary pattern of the respective country
was the most frequent dietary comparison, although several
studies made further comparisons with many of the above-
noted dietary patterns. Additional approaches were used to
examine modeling scenarios with various replacements of
animal-based foods with plant-based foods.
Most modeling studies [e.g., German National Nutrition
Surveys (22), the National Diet and Nutrition Survey from
the United Kingdom (16, 21), the National Nutrition Survey
from Australia (20)] used cross-sectional assessment of dietary
patterns from surveys of representative adult populations. The
average dietary patterns were compared with modeled food
patterns, such as MDP or vegetarian, as described in detail
below. These findings are generalizable to the US population
because the studies were conducted in countries that are
highly developed and had created dietary guidelines. Using
a modified critical appraisal checklist, we found that the
study quality for the body of evidence reviewed was high,
with scores ranging from 7 of 12 to 12 of 12.
Across the original and updated SR, health outcomes as-
sociated with the dietary patterns were based most often
on various vegetarian dietary patterns, dietary guidelines–
related patterns, the DASH diet, or the MDP. Diet quality
was evaluated in some studies using an index, such as the
Healthy Eating Index (37) or the WHO Technical Report Se-
ries (38). Some studies also modeled health outcomes; for
example, one study assessed the interaction between health
and sustainability scores through use of the WHO Technical
Report Series and the LCA sustainability score to measure
combined nutritional and ecological value (28). In addition,
Scarborough et al. (27) used the DIETRON model to estimate
deaths delayed or averted for each dietary pattern.
The environmental impacts that were most commonly
modeled were GHG emissions and use of resources such as
water, energy, and land used for agriculture. Overall, the orig-
inal SR and the update included 18 studies on GHG (14–16,
20–22, 26–31, 35, 36); 4 studies on energy use (22, 25, 26)
and 3 studies on water use (22, 24, 26). Certain studies as-
sessed other environmental metrics, including average impact

 on the ecosystem (17), carrying capacity (individuals sup-
ported) (23), and global warming potential (34). One study
assessed blue water use, which includes fresh surface water
and groundwater such as lakes, rivers, and aquifers (22).
In general, the environmental impact of the dietary pat-
terns was assessed by using LCA methodology. We analyzed
the ecological impact of each food and/or food category
being assessed. LCA is a standardized methodological frame-
work for assessing the environmental impact (or load) at-
tributable to the life cycle of a food product. The life cycle
of a food typically includes agricultural production, process-
ing and packaging, transportation, retail, use, and waste dis-
posal. An inventory of all of the stages of the life cycle is
determined for each food product, and a weight or number
of points is attributed to each food or food category based
on impacts on the environment (3). These results can be
translated into measures of impact on energy resources, eco-
system quality, and population health using programs such
as Eco-Indicator (39). In addition to the health assessment
tools listed above, some studies used a standardized ap-
proach to LCA analysis to determine damage from GHG
emissions and use of resources such as damage to human
health–related outcomes, including the number and duration
of disease and life-years lost resulting from premature death
from environmental causes. It should be noted that not every
stage of the life cycle was assessed in all of the included studies.
The specifics on included LCA stages are detailed in Table 1. In
addition, the number of foods that have been evaluated
through use of LCA is limited and therefore requires extrapo-
lation to assess complete dietary patterns.
Fewer studies assessed food security, and they did so in
terms of cost differences, usually between an average dietary
pattern for the population and a sustainable dietary pattern
for that country (13, 18, 21, 29, 31–34). The basic food bas-
ket concept was used in one study (18), representing the cost
for a 2-adult/2-child household.
Dietary patterns in relation to health and
sustainability outcomes
Vegetarian and omnivorous diets. Several studies surveyed
variations in vegetarian diets or a range of diets from vegan
to omnivorous dietary patterns and associated health and
environmental outcomes (17, 23, 24). These studies examined
dietary patterns ranging from low-fat, lacto-ovo vegetarian
diets to high-animal-fat, meat-rich omnivorous diets (23).
The findings from these studies showed that reduced meat
consumption was expected to improve health outcomes and
decrease GHG emissions and land, energy, and water usage.
In Italy, beef was the food with the greatest projected impact
on resources and the ecosystem. The average diet in Italy
had the highest environmental impact and lowest health score,
whereas the vegan diet demonstrated the lowest environmen-
tal impact and highest health score (17). In the United States,
the average meat-based diet was compared with a lacto-ovo
vegetarian diet. This analysis showed that energy, land, and
water usage were higher for the meat-based diet than for the

GHG emissions:
Optimized United Kingdom
diet (meets WHO recommen-
dations, but no GHG target),
compared with the average
United Kingdom diet resulted
in a 17% decrease in GHG and
would save ;7 million YLL
during a 30-y period
GHG reduction targets were
modeled further: 10%, 20%,
30%, 40%, 50%, and 60% re-
duction in GHG
GHG emissions:
Shift in optimized United
Kingdom diets as GHG reduced
further, with increasingly more
nonstarchy vegetables and less
fruit (still more than the average
United Kingdom diet), because
vegetables are associated with
lower GHG than fruit, on aver-
age
As GHG targets were re-
duced, consumption of RPM in
optimized United Kingdom
diets was reduced and eventu-
ally removed (50–60% GHG)
Substantial benefits for
health and climate
change mitigation can
be achieved in the
United Kingdom by
modifying existing
diets to meet nutri-
tional requirements
while also reducing
GHG.
Simply optimizing
diets to meet nutri-
tional guidelines re-

eggs, dairy, fruit, oil, seeds,
vegetables, beans, and grains;
beef stood alone in requiring 31
times the land area as the
equivalent quantity of grain
On balance, meat in-

GHG, 72%; land use, 58%; en-
ergy, 52%; water, 33%
Adherence to a WDP: increased all
impact categories by 12–72%
GHG emissions: meat contributed
the most for WDP and SCP,
whereas dairy contributed most
for MDP
Land use: meat contributed the
most for all diets except MDP,
for which dairy contributed the
most
Energy use: dairy contributed
the most for all diets, followed
by meat for WDP, fish for SCP,
and vegetables for MDP
Water use: vegetables contrib-
uted the most for MDP,
whereas vegetable oils contrib-
uted the most for SCP-FB and
SCP-CS; dairy and vegetable oils
made comparable contribu-
tions to WDP
MDP in Spain would re-
duce GHG (72%), agri-
cultural land use (58%)

tion (52%), and water
consumption (33%).
Adherence to a WDP
would increase all of
these between 12%

NND reduced environmental

Cost:
Socioeconomic savings for
shift to NND was 26% of envi-
ronmental cost of the ADD,
equivalent to €266 (US$362.98) $
person21 $ y21
When the additional envi-
ronmental cost of international
transport was considered in
scenario 2, savings rose to 32%
of the environmental cost of
the ADD; however, the higher
cost of organic produce fea-
tured in the NND offsets this
savings, reducing it to 5% of the
environmental cost of the ADD
in scenario 3, or €42 (US$57.31) $

GWP: animal produce was re-
sponsible for 69% of environ-
mental cost for ADD and 65%
for NND; in scenario 2, animal
produce was responsible for
63% for ADD and 64% for NDD;
in scenario 3, animal produce
was responsible for 59% for
ADD and 68% for NND; the in-
clusion of land use change
more than doubled the differ-

Reducing the content of

 lacto-ovo vegetarian diet (24); the fossil fuel required to pro-
duce 1 kcal of protein was highest for beef and lamb. A study
in New York State found that increasing the amount of meat in
the diet increased per capita land requirements and supported
fewer people, effectively lowering carrying capacity (23). In
this model, however, modest amounts of beef and dairy could
be accommodated; diets that included modest amounts of
these foods could feed slightly more people than could vege-
tarian diets with higher quantities of fat. This was attributed
to the use of land for grazing that could not otherwise be
used for food crop production.
We identified several additional studies that examined
vegetarian dietary patterns. Data from the Adventist Health
Study 2 were used to characterize the differential environ-
mental and health effects of 3 dietary patterns—vegetarian,
semivegetarian, and nonvegetarian—that varied in animal
and plant foods (35). Compared with the nonvegetarian
diet, semivegetarian and vegetarian diets were projected to
decrease GHG emissions and mortality rates. Tilman and
Clark (36) compared pescatarian and vegetarian diets with
an omnivorous diet. In their global assessment of 100 populous
nations, they found that pescatarian and vegetarian diets de-
creased all-cause and ischemic heart disease mortality, as well
as type 2 diabetes and cancer incidence, compared with an om-
nivorous diet. The same dietary pattern comparisons resulted
in a projected reduction in GHG emissions and cropland use
by 2050 for pescatarian and vegetarian diets compared with
the omnivorous diet. For GHG emissions the largest difference
(;250-fold) was between ruminant meats (beef and lamb) and
legumes on a GHG emissions per gram of protein basis.
Other studies variously compared average national die-
tary patterns with vegetarian diets, dietary guidelines–related
diets, and the MDP in selected countries (20, 22, 28). Overall,
they estimated greater environmental benefits, including re-
duced projected GHG emissions and land use, resulting
from vegan, lacto-ovo vegetarian, pescavegetarian, and dietary
guidelines–related patterns and the MDP
. These diets were
healthier than the average diets consumed and most had high
sustainability scores. According to van Dooren et al. (28), the con-
sistent response measured across vegetarian, MDP, and dietary
guidelines–related scores could be explained by a reduction in
the consumption of meat, dairy, extras (e.g., snacks, sweets), and
beverages, as well as a reduction in overall food consumption.
In all of the studies that assessed a dietary guidelines–
related pattern (20, 22, 28), the patterns were projected to
improve health benefits and environmental measures, includ-
ing GHG emissions and land, water, and energy usage, com-
pared with average consumption patterns. Studies that made
additional comparisons found even greater environmental
changes from lacto-ovo vegetarian and vegan diets (22, 28).
One study examined actual diets and evaluated their rela-
tion to GHG emissions (14). The study estimated the differ-
ence in dietary GHG emissions between self-selected meat
eaters, fish eaters, vegetarians, and vegans in the EPIC-Oxford
cohort in the United Kingdom. The highest GHG emissions
were associated with the dietary pattern of individuals
whose diet was high in meat (>100 g/d); GHG emissions

 decreased as meat consumption decreased from medium to
low amounts (50–99 g/d to <50 g/d), and the lowest GHG
emissions were observed for fish eaters, vegetarians, and
vegans. Overall, GHG emissions associated with self-selected
meat-eaters were ~2 times as high as those in vegans. This in-
dicates that results from observational studies of self-selected
diets are consistent with results from modeling analyses.
MDP and DASH dietary pattern. As previously indicated,
the MDP was compared with average intake patterns of in-
dividual countries and with other vegetarian and dietary
guidelines–related patterns in 2 different studies (26, 28).
The MDP is a traditional dietary pattern characterized by
abundant use of olive oil; high consumption of plant and
plant-based foods (fruits, vegetables, legumes, cereals, nuts,
and seeds); frequent but moderate intake of wine (especially
red wine) with meals; moderate consumption of seafood, fer-
mented dairy products (yogurt and cheese), poultry, and eggs;
and lower intake of red and processed meats (RPM) and
sweets (3). In both studies, adherence to the MDP, compared
with usual intake, reduced the environmental footprint of the
diet by decreasing GHG emissions, energy, land use for agri-
culture, and water. For the MDP in Spain, GHG emissions
and land, water, and energy usage were decreased relative to
the current Spanish diet. The health advantages of the MDP
were based on previously documented public health benefits
of the well-characterized Spanish MDP (40). Van Dooren
et al. (28) found that the MDP had the highest health score
of the multiple diets they compared in the Netherlands; how-
ever, the sustainability score, GHG emissions index, and land
use index of the MDP were below those of vegan and vegetar-
ian diet patterns, despite being above the Dutch dietary guide-
lines pattern and the average Dutch diet (ADD). Meat products
in the Dutch diet had the greatest environmental impact in
terms of GHG emissions and land use.
Tilman and Clark (36) compared the MDP with an om-
nivorous diet, in addition to the comparisons discussed
above for pescatarian and vegetarian diets. Using population
forecasts, they found that by 2050 the MDP may offer re-
duced coronary heart disease mortality, type 2 diabetes,
and cancer incidence as well as reduced GHG emissions
and cropland use, as compared with current trends in die-
tary pattern changes.
Another well-characterized dietary pattern, the DASH
diet, was studied for relations to environmental outcomes.
The DASH dietary pattern emphasizes the intake of vegeta-
bles, fruits, and whole grains; includes low-fat dairy pro-
ducts, poultry, fish, legumes, nontropical vegetable oils,
and nuts; and limits the intake of sweets, sugar-sweetened
beverages, and red meats. The health benefits of the DASH
diet are well established: it has been shown to prevent or
control hypertension and other chronic diseases. A cross-
sectional study assessed adherence to a DASH diet in the
EPIC-Norfolk cohort and its association with GHG emis-
sions and diet costs (31). Greater adherence to a DASH
dietary pattern was associated with lower GHG emissions
in an across-quintiles comparison. GHG emissions were
most strongly and positively associated with meat consump-
tion and negatively associated with whole-grain consump-
tion. Greater adherence to the DASH diet was associated
with higher dietary costs, with the mean cost of diets in
the top quintile of DASH scores being 18% higher than
that of diets in the lowest quintile.
Diet scenarios. Another group of studies examined differ-
ent diet scenarios that usually replaced animal-based foods
with plant-based foods. Two studies focused on RPM. Aston
et al. (16) evaluated a dietary pattern that was modeled on
the average United Kingdom population in which the pro-
portion of vegetarians in the survey was doubled and the re-
mainder adopted a dietary pattern consistent with the lowest
category of RPM consumers. They found that the low RPM
or the vegetarian diet had a lower projected risk of diabetes
and colorectal cancer, and the expected reduction in GHG
emissions was ;3% of the current total carbon dioxide
emissions for agriculture. de Carvalho et al. (19) examined
a high-RPM dietary pattern with diet quality assessed
through use of the Brazilian Healthy Eating Index. They
found that excessive meat intake was associated not only
with poorer diet quality but also with increased projected
GHG emissions (;4% total carbon dioxide emitted by agri-
culture in Brazil). A third study (27) found that in the
United Kingdom a diet with 50% reduced total meat and
dairy replaced by fruit, vegetables, and cereals contributed
the most to the estimated reduced risk of total mortality
and had the greatest positive environmental impact.
Energy intake also was measured in studies. Pradhan
et al. (25) examined 16 global dietary patterns grouped
into 4 categories with per capita intake of low-, moderate-,
high-, and very-high-calorie diets. They assessed the relation
of these patterns to GHG emissions. Low-calorie diets had
<2100 kcal/d per capita and were composed of >50% cereals
or >70% starchy roots, cereals, and pulses. Animal products
were a minor (<10% of dietary energy) component in this
group. Moderate-, high-, and very-high-calorie diets had
2100–2399, 2400–2800, and >2800 kcal/d per capita, respec-
tively. Very-high-calorie diets contained large amounts of
meat and alcoholic beverages. Overall, the very-high-calorie
diets that are common in the developed world exhibited
high total per capita carbon dioxide emissions as a result
of the high intake of animal products, whereas the low-
calorie diets had the lowest total per capita carbon dioxide
emissions.
Vieux et al. (15) examined dietary patterns with different
indicators of nutritional quality and found that despite con-
taining large amounts of plant foods, not all diets of the
highest nutritional quality were those with the lowest
GHG emissions. For this study, 4 dietary patterns were iden-
tified through use of nutrient-based indicators: 1 high-, 2
intermediate-, and 1 low-quality diet. The high-quality
diet had higher GHG emissions than the low-quality diet.
A higher consumption of starches, sweets, and salted snacks
was associated with lower GHG emissions, and an increased
intake of fruit and vegetables was associated with increased

 GHG emissions; however, the strongest positive association
with GHG emissions was for the ruminant meat group.
Biesbroek et al. (30) examined the ADD in the EPIC-NL
cohort and modeled a meat-substitution scenario, with one-
third of the usual meat intake substituted with other foods.
In a 16-y follow-up, modeled substitutions of 35 g meat/d
with vegetables; fruit, nuts, and seeds; pasta, rice, and couscous;
or fish were associated with increased survival rates and re-
duced GHG emissions and land use. A second epidemiologic
modeling study designed the New Nordic Diet (NND) to be
both healthy and sustainable; it contained 35% less meat than
the ADD (34). Meat in the NND was substituted with whole-
grain products, nuts, fruits, and vegetables. Overall, the
NND reduced the environmental impact relative to the
ADD in all 16 impact categories. The socioeconomic sav-
ings related to this diet shift was 32% of the overall envi-
ronmental cost of the ADD.
Sustainable diets and related costs. Three studies in the
original SR (18, 21, 29) and 2 studies in the update (13, 33)
examined sustainable diets and related costs. Macdiarmid
et al. (21) examined a “sustainable with acceptability con-
straints” diet that included 52 foods, which was projected
to reduce dietary GHG emissions by 36%. This diet in-
cluded dairy and meat but less of these foods than in the
average United Kingdom diet. The cost of the sustainable
plus “acceptability” diet was comparable to that of the aver-
age United Kingdom diet, showing that a sustainable diet
that meets dietary requirements and projected lower GHG
emissions can be achieved without eliminating meat or dairy
products completely and without increasing the cost to the
consumer. Wilson et al. (29) modeled several dietary patterns
focused on decreased GHG emissions or costs, as well as
vegetarian/vegan patterns, MDP, and Asian dietary patterns.
They found that all diets that minimized costs or GHG emis-
sions were both less expensive and healthier than the average
New Zealand diet; however, healthier diets such as the MDP
and Asian dietary pattern achieved smaller GHG-emission re-
ductions than patterns modeled to reduce GHG emissions
alone. When these patterns were optimized to reduce GHG
emissions, they became more expensive than the simplified
versions. The vegan low GHG-emissions pattern also was
more expensive than other low GHG-emission patterns.
Another approach to examining food costs was food bas-
ket modeling, a common approach for assessing food costs
and availability. In Australia, Barosh et al. (18) compared a
typical food basket with a sustainable and healthy (S&H)
food basket. The typical food basket was based on average
weekly food purchases of a reference household, and the
S&H basket added adherence to Australian dietary guide-
lines and environmental impact. The cost of the S&H basket
was more than the typical basket; the most economically dis-
advantaged individuals spent 30% more for the S&H basket.
In this analysis, the most economically disadvantaged
groups at both neighborhood and household levels expe-
rienced the greatest difficulty in accessing an affordable
S&H basket.
A cross-sectional study from the Individual and National
Food Consumption Survey assessed self-selected diets that
were culturally acceptable in France (13). Results showed
that 23% of men and 20% of women consumed a “more
sustainable” diet. This diet had an above average diet quality
score and below average GHG emissions, costs, and energy
density and energy content compared with the average
French diet. Overall, a 20% reduction in diet-related GHG
emissions while maintaining high nutritional quality was
possible at no extra cost by reducing energy intake and
energy density and increasing the share of plant-based
products.
Another study from the United Kingdom modeled diet
scenarios that improved health and reduced GHG emissions
based on compliance with WHO dietary recommendations
and GHG emissions targets (33). Adherence to the WHO di-
etary recommendations alone resulted in a 17% decrease in
GHG emissions compared with the average British diet. Diet
scenarios that were modeled on further GHG emissions re-
ductions were projected to reduce the incidence of mortality,
coronary heart disease, stroke, some cancers, and type 2 di-
abetes. A >40% GHG-emissions reduction, however, was
predicted to alter acceptability of the diet and reduce some
health benefits. Overall, the combined benefits of moderate
diet modifications were achieved by reducing consumption
of animal products and processed foods and increasing con-
sumption of cereals, vegetables, and fruits.
Conclusions
The 2015 DGAC concluded “Consistent evidence indicates
that, in general, a dietary pattern that is higher in plant-
based foods, such as vegetables, fruits, whole grains, le-
gumes, nuts, and seeds, and lower in animal-based foods
is more health promoting and is associated with lesser envi-
ronmental impact (GHG and energy, land, and water use)
than is the current average US diet. A diet more environ-
mentally sustainable than the average US diet can be
achieved without excluding any food groups. The evidence
consists primarily of LCA modeling studies or land use stud-
ies from highly developed countries, including the United
States” (3). Our update further supports and strengthens
the original conclusions.
Overall, the studies in this updated SR were consistent
with the original review in showing that higher consumption
of animal-based foods was associated with higher estimated
environmental impact, whereas increased consumption of
plant-based foods was associated with an estimated lower en-
vironmental impact. Assessment of individual foods within
these broader categories showed that meat—sometimes spec-
ified as RPM or ruminant meat (beef and lamb)—was consis-
tently identified as the single food with the greatest impact
on the environment, most often in terms of GHG emissions
and/or land use.
The evidence demonstrates that health-promoting die-
tary patterns also improve environmental sustainability
indicators; dietary patterns that adhered to dietary guide-
lines (in total, not in part) were more sustainable than the

 population’s current average amount of dietary pattern in-
take. Well-characterized dietary patterns with known health
benefits, such as the MDP and DASH diets, also were shown
to be more environmentally sustainable than average con-
sumption patterns. Taken together, the studies agreed on
the environmental impact of different dietary patterns, de-
spite varied methods of assessment and life cycle stages in-
cluded. There was limited and inconsistent evidence as to
whether sustainable diets were more or less expensive than
average diets. This is an important question to address in
future studies.
We recognize the strength and limitations of these stud-
ies. The main strengths include state-of-the-art LCA, com-
prehensive assessment of health outcomes (including both
morbidity and mortality) in the dietary patterns considered,
examination of multiple dietary patterns under different
scenarios, and reproducibility and/or consistency of findings
across different populations. The potential limitations are
that most of the studies are cross-sectional rather than lon-
gitudinal, the environmental impact is based on modeling
analysis, most of the studies were conducted in Europe,
and the measurements of dietary patterns were not entirely
consistent across different studies.
It also should be kept in mind that these studies, in gen-
eral, use averaged production practice data to determine the
GHG or land use impact of particular food items. Within
each, however, there is a wide range of actual practices; for
example, flood furrow compared with trickle irrigation.
The combination of irrigation-efficiency improvements, ir-
rigation timing, and controlled deficits could result in a
17% savings of water in California (41). Producing in differ-
ent places, even in the off-season, could demonstrate im-
provements in GHG emissions release potential (42). The
production of commodity crops such as corn and soybean
exhibit a wide range of net GHG emissions potential, de-
pending on production practices (43). There is the possibil-
ity that different ruminant production strategies will exhibit
marked differences in net GHG emissions, depending on the
carbon-sequestration potential—an area requiring a great
deal of additional research. In other words, although the lit-
erature presented in this SR is clear on the broad impacts of
dietary patterns and environmental attributes, there is much
that can be done to refine these to improve the relation be-
tween a diet that promotes human health and improves the
state of our global ecosystem.
This SR update provides a robust body of evidence that
confirmed the results and conclusions of the original 2015
DGAC SR. The fact that >50% more studies (8) were iden-
tified in the 1-y period after the original SR that spanned
more than a decade demonstrates the scientific attention
that this area of research is receiving. All of the additional
studies were consistent with the original SR and provided
more evidence to support the findings of the DGAC that di-
etary guidelines–related diets, the MDP, the DASH diet, and
vegetarian diets (with variations) were associated with both
improved health and better environmental outcomes. The
body of evidence was expanded in terms of the number
and type of studies (more observational studies, including
a 16-y prospective cohort study), improved consistency
of results across health and environmental outcomes, and
increased generalizability to the US population. As new ev-
idence has emerged, the original SR has been strengthened
and does not require any modification or alteration to the
original conclusions and implications. The insights from
our updated SR show the potential for efficacy of food pol-
icies focused on dietary patterns in contributing significantly
to not only improved public health but also improved envi-
ronmental outcomes and the potential for food security for
future generations. It is important to note that food sustain-
ability was not included in the final 2015–2020 Dietary
Guidelines for Americans (44). We expect future research
in this topic area to inform the 2020 DGAC and dietary
guidelines process.
