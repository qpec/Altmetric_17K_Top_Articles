 Association of Residential Mobility Over the Life Course With
Nonaffective Psychosis in 1.4 Million Young People in Sweden

IMPORTANCE Residential mobility (changing residence) during childhood and early
adolescence is a possible risk factor for several adverse health outcomes, including psychotic
disorders. However, it is unclear whether sensitive periods to residential mobility exist over
the life course, including in adulthood, or if greater moving distances, which might disrupt
social networks, are associated with a greater psychosis risk.
OBJECTIVE To examine the association between residential mobility over the life course and
the risk of nonaffective psychosis.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This prospective cohort study included all people born
in Sweden between January 1, 1982, and December 31, 1995, who were alive and resided in
Sweden on their 16th birthday who were followed up until up to age 29 years (ending
December 2011). Participants were followed until receiving a first diagnosis of an International
Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10)
nonaffective psychotic disorder (F20-29), emigration, death, or the end of 2011, whichever
was sooner. National register linkage provided exposure, outcome, and covariate data
(complete data were available for 1 440 383 participants [97.8%]).
EXPOSURES The exposures to distance moved and the number of residential moves were
examined for participants at the following periods over the life course: 0 to 6 years, 7 to 15
years, 16 to 19 years, and 20 years and older.
RESULTS This study included 1 440 383 participants, of whom 4537 (0.31%) had nonaffective
psychotic disorder (median age, 20.9 [interquartile range, 19.0-23.3]). More frequent moves
during childhood and adolescence were associated with an increased risk of nonaffective
psychosis that showed dose-response associations independent of covariates. The most
sensitive period of risk occurred during late adolescence; those who moved during each year
between age 16 to 19 years had an increased adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 1.99 (95% CI,
1.30-3.05) compared with those who never moved. One move during adulthood was not
associated with psychosis risk (adjusted HR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.94-1.14), but moving 4 or more
times during adulthood was associated with increased risk (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.82; 95%
CI, 1.51-2.23). Independently, moving greater distances before age 16 years was associated
with an increased risk (adjusted HR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.05-1.19), with evidence of a nonlinear
threshold effect for moves longer than 30 km. The distance moved after age 20 years was
associated with a decreased risk (adjusted HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.63-0.71).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Children and adolescents with less disruption in their
residential environments are less likely to experience psychotic disorders in early adulthood.
Moves that may necessitate changes in school and social networks were most strongly
associated with future risk.

nternational migration is an established risk factor for
psychosis,1andtheriskappearsgreatestforthosemigrating
at earlier ages.2,3 Some studies have suggested that internal
migration (known as residential mobility) may also increase
psychosis risk.4,5 Evidence from Denmark has suggested that
long-distance childhood residential mobility increases the
subsequent risk of schizophrenia and other nonaffective
psychoses,4-6withsomeevidenceofastrongereffectofresiden-
tialinstabilityduringadolescencethaninchildhood.4However,
toourknowledge,noneofthestudieshaveexaminedtheeffect
of residential mobility beyond midadolescence, which may be

ratesofpsychoticdisordersinmoredeprived,sociallyfragmented
urban environments7-9 are a consequence of social drift during
the prodromal phases of disorder, as people may move into
cheaper, more socially isolated environments.10 Moreover, to
date,thegeographicaldistancespeoplemovehavebeencrudely
treatedasmovesbetweenlargeadministrativeareas,potentially
obscuring the nuanced effects of moving over smaller or larger
geographical distances.
In this study, we used data from individuals within a large
population-based cohort, whose residential moves over their
entire early life course (up to age 29 years) could be identified
to small area neighborhood resolution, to examine the risk of
developing nonaffective psychotic disorders associated with
residential mobility during childhood, adolescence, and early
adulthood.Wefocusedonnonaffectivepsychoses,givenstron-
ger evidence that these psychiatric disorders are more strongly
associated with urbanicity and migration than other disor-
ders, such as bipolar disorder or unipolar depression.11,12 Given
previous evidence, we hypothesized that having more fre-
quent residential moves in childhood, adolescence, and early
adulthoodwouldbeassociatedwithanincreasedpsychosisrisk
and that this would be highest for individuals who moved dur-
ingadolescence,whichisakeyperiodforsocialdevelopment.4,13
We also hypothesized that the risk would increase with greater

ceived ethical approval through Psychiatry Sweden from the

finalanalyticalsampleincluded1440383participantswithcom-
plete residential mobility data ( eMethods in the Supplement).
Outcome Measure
Ourmainoutcomemeasurewasaclinicaldiagnosisofnonaffec-
tivepsychoticdisorder(ICD-10:F20-29),includingschizophre-
nia(F20)andothernonaffectivepsychoses(F21-29)asrecorded
in the Swedish National Patient Register. For this study, the
coverage for all inpatient admissions was complete over the
follow-up period and for outpatient admissions from 2001.14,15
Exposure Variables
We investigated whether the number of moves over discrete
periods of the life course and the cumulative distances moved
were associated with subsequent psychosis risk. Age periods
(0-6 years, 7-15 years, 16-19 years, and 20-29 years) were de-
termined a priori to coincide with the transition through the
Swedish public education system. We estimated the number
ofmovesfromtheTotalPopulationRegister,whichrecordsthe
residential location of all people each year to one of 9200
“Small Area for Market Statistics” (SAMS) areas (median popu-
lation size in 2011, 726 [interquartile range, 312-1378]). Small
Area for Market Statistics are designed to be internally socio-
economically homogenous but differ according to the char-
acteristicsofthesocialenvironment,includingdeprivationand
population density.16 For each participant and age period, we
calculated the total number of times a change in SAMS resi-
dence occurred from year to year as: no moves (reference),
1 move, 2 moves, 3 moves, or 4 or more moves (eMethods in
the Supplement). For each age period, we also estimated the
cumulative distance moved by each participant (in kilome-
ters) (eMethods in the Supplement).
Covariates
We included confounder data on continuous age; sex; paren-
tal migration status (both parents Swedish-born vs at least
1 parent being foreign-born); biological parental history of se-
verementalillness(SMI),includingnonaffectivepsychosisand
Key Points
Question Is residential mobility over the life course associated
with the subsequent risk of developing nonaffective psychotic
disorders?
Findings In this prospective cohort study of 1.4 million young
people living in Sweden, followed up each year from birth to age
29 years, more frequent moves during childhood and adolescence
were associated with increased risk for nonaffective psychosis,
peaking between age 16 to 19 years, with moves longer than 50
km independently associated with greater risk. There was less
evidence that moving in adulthood increased risk, except among
those who moved 4 or more times.
Meaning The risk of nonaffective psychosis in young people was
associated with greater residential mobility during formative
periods of childhood and adolescence, which is consistent with the
possibility that the disruption of social networks, peer support,
and identity formation are relevant to the etiology of psychosis.

pant compulsory school educational attainment; family

dance (yes or no) (eMethods in the Supplement).
Statistical Methods
We fitted discrete time proportional hazards models using
complementary log-log models on the attained age scale
(eMethods in the Supplement). Modeling proceeded as fol-
lows: (1) we modeled the crude association of the number of
residential moves and cumulative distance moved in each age
period with psychosis risk, (2) we added all the covariates to
these models (adjustment 1) except for educational attain-
mentatage15to16years(seeResults),(3)weadjustedthemod-
els for residential move data in previous age periods (adjust-
ment 2), and (4) because educational attainment at age 15 to 16
years may have been on the causal pathway between earlier
moves and future psychosis risk, we restricted the adjustment
for this variable to models of residential moves made after age
16 years (adjustment 3). When modeling residential moves af-
terage20years,weexcludedparticipantswhohadnotreached
this age by the end of the follow-up period or who were other-
wise censored between age 16 to 19 years(n = 441 416; 30.1%).
We included university attendance as a potential confounder
(adjustment 4) and effect modifier of the association between
residential moves and nonaffective psychosis risk in adult-
hood. To examine possible threshold effects in the geographi-
cal distances of residential moves, we inspected nonlinear
distance functions using an inverse power (square root) trans-
formation and compared this with a model that was fitted with
a linear distance function via an inspection of Akaike Informa-
tionCriterionscoresinwhichlowerscoresindicatedabetterfit.
We predicted and graphed marginal hazards over the cumula-
tive distance moved in each age period. In a subgroup analy-
sis, we investigated whether any associations of the geographi-
cal distances of residential moves with nonaffective psychosis

Statistical significance was set at P < .05.
Results
Sample Characteristics
Of1440383includedparticipants(97.8%ofcohort;eTable1and
eResults in the Supplement), 4537 (0.31%; 95% CI, 0.30-0.33)
received an ICD-10 diagnosis of nonaffective psychotic disor-
der in Sweden during the follow-up period. The median age
when receiving the first diagnosis was 20.9 years (interquar-
tile range, 19.0-23.3). Participants with nonaffective psychosis
were more likely to be men, come from a lower-income quin-
tile, and have a foreign background, parental history of SMI,
death of a parent before age 16 years, and lower educational at-
tainmentandlesslikelihoodofattendinguniversitythanthere-
mainder of the cohort (Table 1). The distribution of the num-
ber of residential moves (Figure 1) and the cumulative distance
moved differed for participants with nonaffective psychosis
compared with the remainder of the cohort (Table 1). Thus,
before age 20 years, case participants were more likely to have
moved at least once and have had a longer cumulative dis-
tance moved (all P < .001); this pattern was reversed after age
20 years. The correlations within and between the number of
moves and the cumulative distance moved were moderate
(eTable 2 and eResults in the Supplement).
Association Between Residential Mobility
and Nonaffective Psychosis
We observed dose-response associations between greater
moves at age 0 to 6 years, 7 to 15 years, and 16 to 19 years and
the risk of nonaffective psychotic disorder in unadjusted
survival models (Table 2) that persisted after adjusting for
covariates (adjustment 1), including moves at previous ages
(adjustment 2). Thus, compared with never moving, 1, 2, 3, or
4 or more moves between birth and age 6 years were associ-
ated with HRs of 1.13, 1.47, 1.46, and 1.83, respectively (adjust-
ment 1; all P < .001) (Table 2). We observed similar associa-
tions for moves between age 7 to 15 years and stronger
associations at age 16 to 19 years (adjustment 2; Table 2), with
those moving in each year of this period having a 2.88-fold
(95% CI, 1.89-4.40) increased risk compared with those who
never moved. Further adjustment for educational attain-
ment at age 15 to 16 years attenuated risks between age 16 to
19 years (adjustment 3, Table 2), but strong dose-response pat-
terns remained (ie, moving 4 times; HR, 1.99; 95% CI, 1.30-
3.05).
There was weaker evidence that moving after age 20 years
was associated with psychosis risk, with little variation in risk
for those who moved fewer than 3 times in early adulthood,
includingafteradjustmentforeducationalattainmentanduni-
versity attendance (adjustment 4, Table 2). Nonetheless, those
who moved more frequently (4 or more times) remained at a
substantially elevated risk (HR, 1.82; 95% CI, 1.51-2.20). We
found moderate evidence that this relative association was
stronger in those who attended university (HR, 2.56; 95% CI,
1.55-3.54) than those who did not (HR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.34-2.02;
likelihood ratio test P = .02; eTable 3 in the Supplement),
although marginal (ie, absolute) changes in the predicted prob-
abilitiesofnonaffectivepsychosisforeachadditionalmovewere
similar in both groups (eFigure 2 in the Supplement).
The cumulative distances moved at all ages were better
modeled as nonlinear functions with respect to psychosis risk
(eTable 4 in the Supplement). Independent of the number of
moves, greater moving distances before age 16 years in-
creased risk (Table 2), most sharply over shorter (ie, less than
30 km) distances moved (Figure 2A and B). Between age 16 to
19 years, we observed no evidence of any statistically signifi-
cant association with distance. After age 20 years, greater
cumulative distances moved were associated with decreased
psychosis risk, with similar evidence of threshold effects at

 with the thesis that residential mobility is associated with non-
affectivepsychosisthroughamechanismthatisatitsmostsen-

We also found that longer geographical distances of residen-
tial moves during childhood and early adolescence were as-
sociated with increased risk, independently of the number of
moves,particularlyformovesmorethanapproximately30km,
which was consistent with the distances at which the disrup-
tion of school-based or other social networks were more likely.
Theassociationbetweenresidentialmobilityandnonaffec-
tive psychosis was different in young adults. While there was

ences emerged for individuals who moved fewer times in early

Potential Mechanisms
The most supported explanation as to how residential
mobility could have an association with nonaffective psy-
chosis is that a change of residence disrupts an individual’
s
ability to form and maintain friendships or fit within a peer
group. Social isolation is likely to increase one’
s vulnerability
to the effects of life stressors. For example, exposure to
stressful life events could have a greater impact on negative
schemata, low self-esteem, and cognitive biases that are
associated with psychosis17-19 without the buffering effect of
stable friendships.
Some studies suggest that part of the association of resi-
dential mobility with psychosis is mediated via having to
change schools, and that loss of peer relationships and in-
creased social isolation may be involved in the pathway to
risk.20,21 Residential mobility may disrupt social relation-
ships and be associated with subsequent psychosis risk if it
necessitates a change in schools, and if it occurs at a time when
relationships with peers become as or more important than

At ages 0 to 6 (A), 7 to 15 (B), and 16 to 19 years (C) the proportion of cases who
moved once or more was greater than in the population at risk. By contrast, at
20 years and older (D), case participants were more likely to have never moved
than the population at risk. Percentages in the 20 years or older group were
estimated from participants who were not censored before this age
(n = 998 967 [69.9%]). Percentages at all other age ranges were based on the
full sample (N = 1 440 383). At age 16 to 19 years, the maximum number of
possible moves during this period is 4.

 family-based ones. Our finding that the greatest risk was
observed for residential moves during late adolescence, inde-
pendent of academic ability at age 15 to 16 years, is consistent
with this thesis, as is our finding that longer moves predicted
greater psychosis risk. Nonetheless, not all studies have ob-
served associations between school mobility and psychosis
risk,22 suggesting that beyond the school context, other peer
group relationships, including family, kinship, and wider
neighborhood ties, may also be relevant.
Wehavepreviouslyshownthatthecharacteristicsthatmark
someone out as different from most of their peers, whether at
a school level or neighborhood level, are associated with an in-
creasedriskofpsychosis,7,14findingsthatareoftenconceptual-
izedwithintheconceptofsocialdefeat.Ithasbeenhypothesized

greater residential mobility, especially during adolescence, in-
creases psychosis risk if it is subsequently accompanied by

affective psychosis risk to a risk factor in adjusted models (data

 dence after age 20 years, the age at which students in Sweden
complete their university entrance examinations, is likely to
reflect the onset of independence for an individual, be it
through university attendance or entry into the labor market,
and may explain why there were weaker associations with the
number of moves and a strong negative association between
moving distance and psychosis risk during this period. Al-
though less consistently than for greater cognitive ability,33,34
higher levels of education has been associated with reduced
risk of nonaffective psychosis,35,36 Nonetheless, frequent
moves (particularly 4 or more) in early adulthood remained
associated with increased psychosis risk irrespective of
university attendance, and we hypothesize that this reflects
the more chaotic lifestyle of individuals who are at higher risk
of developing psychosis (eg, as a result of substance misuse
or the presence of financial, social, or other mental health
difficulties).
Strengths and Limitations
Thisstudyhasseveralstrengths,includingthelongitudinalde-
sign and large sample size that is highly representative of the
entire (Swedish-born) population. The prospective measure-
ment of our exposure and the use of register data eliminate the
possibilityofrecallbias.Ouroutcomemeasureisknowntohave
good concurrent validity for diagnoses of schizophrenia in this
register,37,38 and psychiatric care in Sweden is both accessible
and free. Using geographical information systems data to es-
timate the number and distance of small area moves over the
life course is a further strength of this study, although we ac-
knowledge that the distances were based on “as the crow flies”
estimates.Wecontrolledforseveralconfoundersthatmayhave
precipitated residential mobility, including parental death, a
parental history of SMI, urban birth, income, younger mater-
nal age at birth, and, with respect to moves made after age 16
years, educational attainment. We acknowledge that we did

Relative hazard of nonaffective psychotic disorder by cumulative distance
between ages 0 to 6 (A), 7 to 15(B), 16 to 19 (C), and 20 or more years (D).
Distances are displayed per 100 km up to a total of 1000 km. The shading
denotes 95% CIs. Each model is based on the predicted relative hazard following
modeling that was adjusted for the covariates listed in adjustment 2 (Table 2).
Distances moved before age 16 years displayed a strong nonlinear trend, such
that the relative hazard of nonaffective psychosis increased most quickly over
shorter move distances (ie, within 30 km) before increasing at a slower rate over
longer distances (with less certainty around point estimates). Distance moved
between age 16 to 19 years was best modeled as a linear predictor, with no
significant differences in the relative hazard of nonaffective psychosis observed
by distance (Table 2). Cumulative distances moved after age 20 years were
associated with a strong, nonlinear reduction in the relative hazard of
nonaffective psychosis, particularly for moves up to approximately 30 km.

 not have data on other potential confounders, including other
adverse childhood experiences such as family discord or pa-
rental separation. Nor did we have data on measures such as
quality of friendships and peer problems, such as bullying, to
test potential mediating pathways. We also lacked direct data
on school changes as an index of disruption to peer relation-
ships. Selection bias might be present from the small amount
of incomplete geographical data in this study (eTable 1 in the
Supplement), although this might be expected to have under-
estimated our associations, given that reasons for missing-
ness include homelessness and being in prison, which are
further markers of residential mobility and are associated with
nonaffective psychosis. While reverse causation is unlikely to
explain our findings, it remains feasible that subthreshold or
prodromal symptoms during childhood or early adolescence
led some families to change residence in the hope that a dif-
ferent school, neighborhood, or proximity to specialist
health care clinicians might improve their child’
s well-being.
Finally, in other studies, residential mobility has been associ-
ated with bipolar disorder and substance use disorders,
suggesting that residential mobility may be a nonspecific risk
factor for several psychiatric disorders.4,5
Conclusions
Accumulating evidence supports childhood and adolescent
residential mobility as an independent risk factor for psychosis
and other mental health outcomes. Efforts are now required to
examine the reasons for this, which may include precipitating
factors such as family discord, as well as the effect such moves
arelikelytohaveonpeergroupformationandsocialsupportdur-
ingcriticalperiodsofdevelopment;thesefindingswillalsohave
