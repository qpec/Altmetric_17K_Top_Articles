Comparative cranial morphology in living and extinct
platypuses: Feeding behavior, electroreception, and
loss of teeth
Masakazu Asahara,1* Masahiro Koizumi,2 Thomas E. Macrini,3 Suzanne J. Hand,4 Michael Archer4
The modern platypus, Ornithorhynchus anatinus, has an eye structure similar to aquatic mammals; however,
platypuses also have a “sixth sense” associated with the bill electro- and mechanoreception that they use without
opening their eyes underwater. We hypothesize that Ornithorhynchus and the Miocene taxon Obdurodon have dif-
ferent sensory capacities, which may have resulted from differences in foraging behavior. To estimate differences in
foraging, sensory systems, and anatomical divergence between these monotremes, we compared their skull
morphologies. Results indicate that the bill of Obdurodon is more dorsally deflected than that of Ornithorhynchus,
suggesting a pelagic foraging behavior in Obdurodon compared to the bottom-feeding behavior in Ornithorhynchus.
The infraorbital foramen of Obdurodon, through which the maxillary nerve passes sensory data from the bill to the
brain, is relatively less developed than that of Ornithorhynchus. Whereas bill-focused sensory perception was likely
shared among Mesozoic monotremes, the highly developed electrosensory system of Ornithorhynchus may represent
an adaptation to foraging in cloudy water. Computed tomography imagery indicates that the enlarged infraorbital
canal of Ornithorhynchus restricts the space available for maxillary tooth roots. Hence, loss of functional teeth in
Ornithorhynchus may possibly have resulted from a shift in foraging behavior and coordinate elaboration of the electro-
receptive sensory system. Well-developed electroreceptivity in monotremes is known at least as far back as the
early Cretaceous; however, there are differences in the extent of elaboration of the feature among members of the
ornithorhynchid lineage.
INTRODUCTION
Extant platypuses (Ornithorhynchus anatinus) forage at the bottom of
streams with their eyes closed, using only electro- and mechano-
reception (1–3). The Miocene monotreme Obdurodon dicksoni has a
larger bill than Or. anatinus and a seemingly well-developed trigeminal
nerve, similar to the extant platypus (4–6). Morphological similarities in
bill structure between these species suggest that they may have filled
similar ecological niches. However, there are also several notable mor-
phological differences. For example, Ornithorhynchus has no teeth as
adults in contrast to Obdurodon, which had fully functional cheek teeth.
Many mammals have lost their teeth as a result of evolution, including
echidnas, anteaters, and baleen whales, but none of these edentulous
animalsactuallymasticatetheirprey withtheirjawmoving(7).Incontrast,
the adult extant platypus still masticates its prey by using horny pads, lo-
cated in the same position as the cheek teeth of Obdurodon, to crush items
being consumed (2). Therefore, the loss of teeth in Ornithorhynchus is un-
likely to be attributable to the lack of their necessity given that commuta-
tion of food remains an important component of feeding in the living
animal. The cause of the loss of teeth is still unclear.
Or. anatinus swims under water with its eyes shut. However, its eyes
show morphological similarities to those of other aquatic and semi-
aquatic mammals, suchthat the lens is adapted to underwater vision with
a steeply curved posterior surface in relation to the flatter anterior surface
(8, 9). This at least raises the possibility that Obdurodon may have kept its
eyes open while foraging for food. However, the difference of sensory
efficiency between Ornithorhynchus and Obdurodon is also still unclear.
The skull morphology of Ob. dicksoni has been examined in detail
(4–6). However, there has been relatively little attention paid to compar-
ing features that may relate specifically to differences in feeding behaviors
and sensory efficiency with modern platypuses. Here, we report several
skull differences between the two species that would appear to reflect
differences in how these two species operated within their respective
habitats, and a potentially correlated difference that may have led to loss
of teeth in adult Or. anatinus.
RESULTS
MorphologicalmeasurementsandanglesoftheskullsofOb.dicksoniand
Or. anatinus (Fig. 1) are shown in Table 1. Regression results suggest that
all variables are significantly correlated to skull size (P < 0.05; Fig. 2). Be-
cause mainland and Tasmanian Ornithorhynchus were plotted along the
same regression line, they were analyzed together (Fig. 2). Regression
lines and corresponding prediction intervals for Ornithorhynchus and
the plot of Obdurodon are shown in Fig. 2.
Obdurodon has a higher angle (a) and lower angle (b) than
Ornithorhynchus (Table 1 and Fig. 1). When the effect of size is removed
by allometric comparison, the result is not different (Fig. 2). Together, these
results suggest that the bill of Obdurodon is deflected more dorsally relative
to the basicranium (dorsal flexion of the face) than that of Ornithorhynchus,
which exhibits ventral deflection (ventral flexion of the face).
Obdurodon is bigger than Ornithorhynchus in all skull measure-
ments, but the proportions of the measurements are also different (Table
1). On the basis of the allometric comparison, the size of the infraorbital
foramen for Obdurodon falls on the regression line of Ornithorhynchus
(Fig. 2). In addition, in the regression of infraorbital foramen on the
greatest length of the skull (GLS), Obdurodon plots below the lower

 prediction interval for Ornithorhynchus (Fig. 2). When geometric
mean was used as the independent variable, the results indicated that
the size of the infraorbital foramen was just smaller than the lower
prediction interval for Ornithorhynchus (Fig. 2). In contrast, the orbit
size of Obdurodon seems to be greater than the lower prediction in-
terval (that is, within prediction intervals) for Ornithorhynchus when
using GLS as an independent variable (Fig. 2). In addition, measures
for Obdurodon are greater than or just on the higher prediction inter-
valofOrnithorhynchuswhengeometricmeanwasusedasanindependent
variable (Fig. 2). These results indicate that Obdurodon had a relatively
smaller infraorbital foramen (and maxillary nerve) but an identical or a
larger orbit (and eye) than Ornithorhynchus in relation to size (for both
GLS and geometric mean). Although the result above is based on intra-
specific allometry of Ornithorhynchus, previous reports on the inter-
specific allometry of the eye also support our finding of larger eyes in
Obdurodon in relation to its skull size (fig. S1).

DISCUSSION
Possible behavioral change over time in feeding strategies
Obdurodon exceeds the range of Ornithorhynchus in terms of cranial
deflection (Fig. 2), indicating that the rostrum of the extinct taxon was
more dorsally deflected with respect to the basicranium than that of
Ornithorhynchus (Fig. 1). Interspecific and intraspecific differences in
the cranial deflection with respect to the basicranium have been re-
ported in other mammals [for example, in previous studies (10–17)].
Cranial deflection is relatively “plastic” in mammals. For example, in-
vestigations of canids have revealed significant intraspecific variation in
this trait, which is determined by the physical relationships of the
splanchnocranium and neurocranium to each other (11–17). However,
Tasmanian and mainland Ornithorhynchus, which became isolated from
each other around 0.7 to 0.94 million years ago (Ma) (18), are plotted
along the same regression line (Fig. 2). Thus, there may be purifying se-
lection for the trait; that is, the degree of cranial deflection is functionally
important and maintained by natural selection in Ornithorhynchus.
Therefore, the difference in the angle of cranial deflection between mod-
ern and fossil ornithorhynchids may reflect differences in behaviors,
rather than being a product of neutral evolution.

 In other mammals, interspecific differences in cranial deflection are
oftenconsideredtoreflectdifferencesinsensoryefficiency[suchaswidth
of visual field in lagomorphans (17) or vocalization in chiropterans (10)].
However, Ornithorhynchus depends less on vision and sound than do
many mammals (2, 19–21), and sensory efficiency probably does not ex-
plain the ventrally deflected bill in the skull of Ornithorhynchus.
Another possible explanation for a ventrally deflected bill is
feeding behavior. If the rostrum is deflected ventrally, it should op-
timize bottom feeding by aquatic mammals, as seen in, for example,
dugongids feeding on sea grasses and fossil cetaceans on benthic prey
(22). Ornithorhynchus is known to forage on the bottom of rivers and
lakes (2). Therefore, the ventrally deflected bill of Ornithorhynchus
likely represents an adaptation to this kind of foraging. In contrast,
the more dorsally deflected bill of Obdurodon suggests that this taxon
might not have been a bottom feeder but rather may have foraged in
the water column (above the bottom).
Adaptive changes in sensory system
Allometric comparison of the skull measurements indicates that
Obdurodon has a relatively larger orbit (and eyes) and a narrower
infraorbital foramen (and maxillary nerve) than Ornithorhynchus
(Fig. 2). A well-developed trigeminal nerve, including the maxillary
nerve, is the most prominent anatomical feature responsible for relaying
“bill sense” (electro- and mechanoreception) to the brain of the platypus
(2, 3). Although Obdurodon had a bigger bill than Ornithorhynchus
(7, 8), the trigeminal nerve should be a direct index of bill sensitivity.
Therefore, our findings regarding the infraorbital foramen suggest that
the bill of Obdurodon was less electro- or mechanoreceptive than that of
Ornithorhynchus. The results regarding orbit size suggest that Obdurodon
had greater visual acuity than Ornithorhynchus. It suggests that within
the ornithorhynchid lineage, there was an evolutionary transition from
dependence on vision to dependence on electro- and mechanoreception
during foraging. This transition probably involved a concomitant reduc-
tion in eye size and expansion of the trigeminal nerve (Fig. 2).
One possible cause of the transition in dependence from eyes to
electro-andmechanoreceptionmayhavebeenachangeinforagingbehav-
ior as discussed above. Vision might have been effective for Obdurodon
foraging in the water column. However, Ornithorhynchus forages on the
stream bottom, where mud can be stirred up by the moving bill and sub-
sequently cloud the field of vision. In such a situation, vision becomes less
effective, and electro- and mechanoreception of the bill are more impor-
tant. This behavioral difference may be responsible for the sensory
transition from vision to bill sense.
Cause of tooth loss in Ornithorhynchus
The enlargement of the trigeminal nerve and infraorbital canal, im-
mediately above the base of the maxillary cheek teeth in ornithorhynchids,
could well have resulted in increasing space constraints to maintain
tooth roots required to support cheek teeth. Our computed tomography
(CT) slice images indicate that Obdurodon had tooth alveoli in the
upper jaw (Fig. 3) (7, 8). In contrast, the extant Ornithorhynchus maxilla
is very thin and unable to house tooth roots. This change in the maxilla,
as well as increased dependence on electro- and mechanoreception in
Ornithorhynchus associated with bottom foraging, correlates with hyper-
trophy of the infraorbital canal and the associated maxillary nerve
(Fig. 3). Ornithorhynchus is unique among mammals that have lost their
teeth in that it still masticates using horny pads, which do not require
alveoli for support (Fig. 3). It should be mentioned that Obdurodon
barely managed to sustain teeth because it had a substantially de-
veloped infraorbital canal, albeit slightly less developed than that of
Ornithorhynchus (Figs. 2 and 3).
Well-developed trigeminal nerves and electroreception are found in
monotremes at least as far back as the early Cretaceous (23, 24). However,
there are differences in the extent of elaboration of these features within
the group. Toothed monotremes, such as the species of Obdurodon that
lived during the Miocene, may have had less-developed electroreceptive
capacities than Ornithorhynchus. Ornithorhynchus is sometimes called
a living fossil, yet this species is characterized by autapomorphies that
distinguish it from its extinct relatives. The loss of teeth and extremely
well-developed electroreceptivity in Ornithorhynchus may have emerged
relatively recently.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
We examined 32 skulls of Or. anatinus in the mammalogy collections
of the U.S. National Museum of Natural History (Washington, DC).
We obtained comparative data about the skull of Ob. dicksoni from
Digimorph (http://digimorph.org). The holotype, Queensland Museum
F20568, is a skull from the middle Miocene Ringtail Site from the
Riversleigh World Heritage Area in northwestern Queensland. Ringtail
Site has been radiometrically dated at 13.56 ± 0.66 Ma (25). To compare
the internal morphology of the infraorbital canal, we CT-imaged a fluid
specimen (preserved in 50% ethanol) of Or. anatinus in the Department
of Acupuncture and Moxibustion, Tokyo Ariake University of Medical
and Health Sciences, Tokyo (YAMA M-1), using the TXS320-ACTIS
industrial microfocus CT scanner (Tesco Corp.) at the National Museum
of Nature and Sciences, Tokyo. Slice images were obtained from the three-
dimensional (3D) data from Digimorph and the fluid specimen. We used
ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health) for 3D image processing.
Caliper measurements (Fig. 1) were taken from skulls of Or. anatinus
and a 3D-printed replica of the skull of Ob. dicksoni (using DMM.com
service, Japan; acrylic plastic, 0.2-mm resolution). In addition, photo-
graphs were taken from the left side of the specimens of the two species,

 and the two angles were measured (shown in Fig. 1) using ImageJ. The
angles were determined on the basis of the intersections of the lateral and
dorsoventral planes. The lateral plane was defined on the basis of how
the specimen lays when placed on a flat surface. The dorsoventral plane
was defined as the plane connecting the occipital condyle and the dorsal
ridge of the foramen magnum, which determines the orientation of the
cranium from the neck.
To eliminate the effect of size, allometric regressions were used to
compare skull measurements for both species. We used the GLS and
the geometric mean of all linear measurements as independent variables
in this analysis. All statistical analyses were performed using Minitab 14
(Minitab Inc.).
