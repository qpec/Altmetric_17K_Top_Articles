Endocannabinoids: A Promising
Impact for Traumatic Brain Injury

The endogenous cannabinoid (endocannabinoid) system regulates a diverse array
of physiological processes and unsurprisingly possesses considerable potential
targets for the potential treatment of numerous disease states, including two
receptors (i.e., CB1 and CB2 receptors) and enzymes regulating their endogenous
ligands N-arachidonoylethanolamine (anandamide) and 2-arachidonyl glycerol (2-AG).
Increases in brain levels of endocannabinoids to pathogenic events suggest this
system plays a role in compensatory repair mechanisms. Traumatic brain injury
(TBI) pathology remains mostly refractory to currently available drugs, perhaps due
to its heterogeneous nature in etiology, clinical presentation, and severity. Here,
we review pre-clinical studies assessing the therapeutic potential of cannabinoids
and manipulations of the endocannabinoid system to ameliorate TBI pathology.
Specifically, manipulations of endocannabinoid degradative enzymes (e.g., fatty acid
amide hydrolase, monoacylglycerol lipase, and α/β-hydrolase domain-6), CB1 and
CB2 receptors, and their endogenous ligands have shown promise in modulating
cellular and molecular hallmarks of TBI pathology such as; cell death, excitotoxicity,
neuroinflammation, cerebrovascular breakdown, and cell structure and remodeling.
TBI-induced behavioral deficits, such as learning and memory, neurological motor
impairments, post-traumatic convulsions or seizures, and anxiety also respond to
manipulations of the endocannabinoid system. As such, the endocannabinoid system
possesses potential drugable receptor and enzyme targets for the treatment of diverse
TBI pathology. Yet, full characterization of TBI-induced changes in endocannabinoid
ligands, enzymes, and receptor populations will be important to understand that role
this system plays in TBI pathology. Promising classes of compounds, such as the plant-
derived phytocannabinoids, synthetic cannabinoids, and endocannabinoids, as well as
their non-cannabinoid receptor targets, such as TRPV1 receptors, represent important
areas of basic research and potential therapeutic interest to treat TBI.

Endocannabinoids and Traumatic Brain Injury
INTRODUCTION
Traumatic brain injury accounts for approximately 10 million
deaths and/or hospitalizations annually in the world, and
approximately 1.5 million annual emergency room visits and
hospitalizations in the US (Langlois et al., 2006). Young men
are consistently over-represented as being at greatest risk for
TBI (Langlois et al., 2006). While half of all traumatic deaths
in the USA are due to brain injury (Mayer and Badjatia, 2010),
the majority of head injuries are considered mild and often
never receive medical treatment (Corrigan et al., 2010). Survivors
of TBI are at risk for lowered life expectancy, dying at a 3·2
times more rapid rate than the general population (Baguley
et al., 2012). Survivors also face long term physical, cognitive,
and psychological disorders that greatly diminish quality of life.
Even so-called mild TBI without notable cell death may lead to
enduring cognitive deficits (Niogi et al., 2008; Rubovitch et al.,
2011). A 2007 study estimated that TBI results in $330,827
of average lifetime costs associated with disability and lost
productivity, and greatly outweighs the $65,504 estimated costs
for initial medical care and rehabilitation (Faul et al., 2007),
demonstrating both the long term financial and human toll
of TBI.
The
development
of
management
protocols
in
major
trauma centers (Brain Trauma Foundation et al., 2007) has
improved mortality and functional outcomes (Stein et al., 2010).
Monitoring of intracranial pressure is now standard practice
(Bratton et al., 2007), and advanced MRI technologies help
define the extent of brain injury in some cases (Shah et al., 2012).
Current treatment of major TBI is primarily managed through
surgical intervention by decompressive craniotomy (Bullock
et al., 2006) which involves the removal of skull segments to
reduce intracranial pressure. Delayed decompressive craniotomy
is also increasingly used for intractable intracranial hypertension
(Sahuquillo and Arikan, 2006). The craniotomy procedure is
associated with considerable complications, such as hematoma,
subdural hygroma, and hydrocephalus (Stiver, 2009). At present,
the pathology associated with TBI remains refractive to currently
available pharmacotherapies (Meyer et al., 2010) and as such
represents an area of great research interest and in need of
new potential targets. Effective TBI drug therapies have yet to
be proven, despite promising preclinical data (Lu et al., 2007;
Mbye et al., 2009; Sen and Gulati, 2010) plagued by translational
problems once reaching clinical trials (Temkin et al., 2007;
Tapia-Perez et al., 2008; Mazzeo et al., 2009).
The many biochemical events that occur in the hours and
months following TBI have yielded preclinical studies directed
toward a single injury mechanism. However, an underlying
premise of the present review is an important need to address
the multiple targets associated with secondary injury cascades
following TBI. A growing body of published scientific research
indicates that the endogenous cannabinoid (endocannabinoid;
eCB) system possesses several targets uniquely positioned to
modulate several key secondary events associated with TBI. Here,
we review the preclinical work examining the roles that the
different components of the eCB system play in ameliorating
pathologies associated with TBI.
THE ENDOCANNABINOID (eCB) SYSTEM
Originally, “
Cannabinoid”was the collective name assigned to
the set of naturally occurring aromatic hydrocarbon compounds
in the Cannabis sativa plant (Mechoulam and Goani, 1967).
Cannabinoid now more generally refers to a much more broad
set of chemicals of diverse structure whose pharmacological
actions or structure closely mimic that of plant-derived
cannabinoids. Three predominant categories are currently in
use; plant-derived phytocannabinoids (reviewed in Gertsch et al.,
2010), synthetically produced cannabinoids used as research
(Wiley et al., 2014) or recreational drugs (Mills et al., 2015),
and the endogenous cannabinoids, N-arachidonoylethanolamine
(anandamide) (Devane et al., 1992) and 2-AG (Mechoulam et al.,
1995; Sugiura et al., 1995).
These three broad categories of cannabinoids generally
act through cannabinoid receptors, two types of which have
so far been identified, CB1 (Devane et al., 1988) and CB2
(Munro et al., 1993). Both CB1 and CB2 receptors are coupled
to signaling cascades predominantly through Gi/o-coupled
proteins. CB1 receptors mediate most of the psychomimetic
effects of cannabis, its chief psychoactive constituent THC,
and many other CNS active cannabinoids. These receptors are
predominantly expressed on pre-synaptic axon terminals (Alger
and Kim, 2011), are activated by endogenous cannabinoids that
function as retrograde messengers, which are released from
post-synaptic cells, and their activation ultimately dampens pre-
synaptic neurotransmitter release (Mackie, 2006). Acting as a
neuromodulatory network, the outcome of cannabinoid receptor
signaling depends on cell type and location. CB1 receptors are
highly expressed on neurons in the central nervous system
(CNS) in areas such as cerebral cortex, hippocampus, caudate-
putamen (Herkenham et al., 1991). In contrast, CB2 receptors
are predominantly expressed on immune cells, microglia in
the CNS, and macrophages, monocytes, CD4+ and CD8+
T cells, and B cells in the periphery (Cabral et al., 2008).
Additionally, CB2 receptors are expressed on neurons, but to
a much less extent than CB1 receptors (Atwood and MacKie,
2010). The abundant, yet heterogeneous, distribution of CB1
and CB2 receptors throughout the brain and periphery likely
accounts for their ability to impact a wide variety of physiological
and psychological processes (e.g., memory, anxiety, and pain
perception, reviewed in Di Marzo, 2008) many of which are
impacted following TBI.
Another unique property of the eCB system is the functional
selectivity produced by its endogenous ligands. Traditional
neurotransmitter systems elicit differential activation of signaling
pathways through activation of receptor subtypes by one
neurotransmitter (Siegel, 1999). However, it is the endogenous
ligands of eCB receptors which produce such signaling specificity.
Although several endogenous cannabinoids have been described
(Porter et al., 2002; Chu et al., 2003; Heimann et al., 2007) the
two most studied are anandamide (Devane et al., 1992) and 2-
AG (Mechoulam et al., 1995; Sugiura et al., 1995). 2-AG levels
are three orders of magnitude higher than those of anandamide
in brain (Béquet et al., 2007). Additionally, their receptor affinity
(Pertwee and Ross, 2002; Reggio, 2002) and efficacy differ, with

Endocannabinoids and Traumatic Brain Injury
2-AG acting as a high efficacy agonist at CB1 and CB2 receptors,
while anandamide behaves as a partial agonist (Hillard, 2000a).
In addition, anandamide binds and activates TRPV1 receptors
(Melck et al., 1999; Zygmunt et al., 1999; Smart et al., 2000),
whereas 2-AG also binds GABAA receptors (Sigel et al., 2011).
As such, cannabinoid ligands differentially modulate similar
physiological and pathological processes.
Distinct sets of enzymes, which regulate the biosynthesis
and degradation of the eCBs and possess distinct anatomical
distributions (see Figure 1), exert control over CB1 and
CB2 receptor signaling. Inactivation of anandamide occurs
predominantly through FAAH (Cravatt et al., 1996, 2001),
localized to intracellular membranes of postsynaptic somata and
dendrites (Gulyas et al., 2004), in areas such as the neocortex,
cerebellar cortex, and hippocampus (Egertová et al., 1998).
Inactivation of 2-AG proceeds primarily via MAGL (Dinh
et al., 2002; Blankman et al., 2007), expressed on presynaptic
axon terminals (Gulyas et al., 2004), and demonstrates highest
expression in areas such as the thalamus, hippocampus,
cortex, and cerebellum (Dinh et al., 2002). The availability
of pharmacological inhibitors for eCB catabolic enzymes has
allowed the selective amplification of anandamide and 2-AG
levels following brain injury as a key strategy to enhance
eCB signaling and to investigate their potential neuroprotective
effects.
Finally, 2-AG functions not only as a major cannabinoid
receptor signaling molecule, but also serves as a major precursor
for AA, and therefore plays a role in inflammatory pathways
(see Figure 2). Although AA is a degradative product of both
2-AG (Bell et al., 1979) and anandamide (Deutsch et al., 1997),
MAGL represents a rate-limiting biosynthetic enzyme of highly
bioactive lipid in brain, liver, and lung (Nomura et al., 2011).
Historically, cPLA2 was considered to be the primary rate-
limiting enzyme in AA production (reviewed in Buczynski et al.,
2009). However, MAGL contributes ∼80% and cPLA2 ∼20% of
LPS-stimulated eicosanoids in mouse brain. In contrast, cPLA2
is the dominant enzyme to control AA production in spleen
(Nomura et al., 2011). Therefore, MAGL and cPLA2 appear
to play differential roles in AA production, and concomitantly
its eicosanoid metabolites in a tissue-specific manner (Nomura
et al., 2011). As such, 2-AG functions not only as an endogenous
CB1 and CB2 receptor ligand, but also an immunomodulator
by virtue of its being a major precursor for AA, making it a
versatile target for the treatment of TBI related pro-inflammatory
pathologies. Understanding the biosynthesis mechanisms of
eCBs may prove useful in modulating their entry into pro-
inflammatory pathways. While 2-AG is known to be synthesized
by DAGL-α and DAGL-β (Bisogno et al., 2003), the mechanisms
mediating anandamide production are incompletely understood
(Blankman and Cravatt, 2013).
TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY
PATHOLOGY
Traumatic brain injuries are heterogeneous in their etiology,
clinical presentation, severity, and pathology. The sequelae of
molecular, biochemical, and physiological events that follow the
application of an external mechanical force produce interacting
acute and delayed pathologies, described as primary and
secondary injuries. The initial insult produces an immediate
mechanical disruption of brain tissue (Reilly, 2001). This primary
injury consists of contusion, blood vessel disruption and brain
oedema, localized necrotic cell death, as well as diffuse axonal
injury producing degeneration of cerebral white matter (Adams
et al., 1989; Gaetz, 2004).
Secondary injury mechanisms are initiated within minutes,
in which necrotic and apoptotic cell death in contused areas
and pericontusional penumbra continue over a period of days to
months (Raghupathi, 2004). Neuronal disruption spills excitatory
amino acids into the interstitial space, producing glutamate-
mediated excitotoxicity (Bullock et al., 1998). Massive influx
of Ca2+ into cells (Floyd et al., 2010) produce mitochondrial
dysfunction and the release of ROS which lead to further
apoptosis (Zhao et al., 2005). Injury-induced activation of
CNS resident glial cells, microglia, as well as recruitment
of circulating inflammatory cells, e.g., macrophages, then
produce secretion of inflammatory mediators, cytokines and
chemokines (reviewed in Woodcock and Morganti-Kossmann,
2013). Increased intracranial pressure leads to reductions in
cerebral blood flow (Shiina et al., 1998), while injury-induced
breakdown of the cerebrovascular endothelium contributes to
dysfunction of the BBB (Chodobski et al., 2012). Extracranial
pathologies are also evident following TBI with pulmonary
complications being the most common (Pelosi et al., 2005). NPE
often develops early after brain injury, producing hypoxemia and
further aggravating secondary brain injury (Brambrink and Dick,
1997; Oddo et al., 2010). These varied and interacting disease
processes highlight the necessity to address the multiple targets
associated with secondary injury cascades following TBI.
While there are many types of CNS injury models [e.g., spinal
cord injury, lesion studies, focal and global ischemic injury etc.
(Arai and Lo, 2009; Titomanlio et al., 2015)], this review will
focus primarily on the work investigating manipulations of the
eCB system in preclinical models of TBI.
PRE-CLINICAL EVALUATION OF
CANNABINOIDS TO TREAT TBI
While basal anandamide and 2-AG levels differ within various
structures in the CNS, levels increase on demand in response to a
given stimuli [e.g., the induction of nausea (Sticht et al., 2016) or
pain states (Costa et al., 2008)]. eCBs are lipid messengers not
stored in synaptic vesicles (likely due to their hydrophobicity)
but rather synthesized in an activity-dependent manner from
membrane phospholipid precursors (Alger and Kim, 2011).
Consequently, eCB signaling is enhanced by a stimulus-response
synthesis and release mechanism.

in eCB biosynthetic and catabolic enzymes as a result of brain injury have yet to be investigated, though morphological and molecular reactivity by cell type is well
documented.

FIGURE 2 | Enzymatic regulation of anandamide and 2-AG in normal brain, and following TBI. 2-AG levels are approximately 1,000-fold higher than
anandamide levels in brain. MAGL plays a rate-limited role in the production of AA in brain, lung, and liver (Nomura et al., 2008). Arrows represent known

levels (Hansen et al., 2002). Concussive head trauma in rats
produces a similar pattern of findings in which modest increases
of anandamide levels occur in ipsilateral cortex, and again
with no change in 2-AG levels (Hansen et al., 2002). This
pattern was replicated by Tchantchou et al. (2014), who found
a 1.5-fold increase of anandamide levels at 3 days post-TBI
in ipsilateral mouse brain, and with no change in 2-AG. In
contrast, Panikashvili et al. (2001) reported that TBI in mice
led to increases of 2-AG in ipsilateral brain from 1 to 24 h with
elevations as high as 10-fold. Thus, further research is needed
to discern whether species differences, the model used to elicit
neurotrauma, and/or other procedural considerations contribute
to the differential elevation of these eCBs (Mechoulam and
Lichtman, 2003).
A lack of studies systematically investigating the consequences
of TBI on changes in eCB levels in specific brain regions perhaps
point to the difficulty in measuring changes in the volatile eCBs,
prone to rapid degradation (Deutsch and Chin, 1993; Dinh
et al., 2002). While pharmacological and genetic manipulations
of the eCB system continue to be evaluated following TBI;
full characterization of how eCB biosynthetic and degradative
enzymes, receptors, and endogenous ligands, their precursors
and catabolic products, change as a consequence of TBI remains
to be fully illuminated.
Treatment of Cellular and Molecular
Pathophysiology of TBI
In this section, we review preclinical studies of cannabinoids
in the context of their potential to protect against cellular and
molecular TBI pathology (see Table 1).
CNS Cell Death
Traumatic brain injury-induced neuronal loss occurs almost
immediately as necrotic cell death and continues for months
following the initial insult via both necrotic and apoptotic
cell death (Raghupathi, 2004). From a traumatic insult, the
initial contused area forms a regional primary lesion or infarct
surrounding which is the pericontusional penumbra, the area
immediately adjacent to the primary lesion and at risk for
further neurodegeneration. The evolution of the pericontusional
penumbra occurs largely due to secondary injury mechanisms
and has long been considered a candidate for interventions to
protect against, or salvage from, further injury (Wang et al.,
2014). The investigation of cannabinoids on traumatic CNS cell
death have thus far demonstrated efficacy in two areas; attenuated
neurodegeneration and reduced lesion volume.
Neurodegeneration, commonly measured by reductions in
the neuronal marker fluoro-jade C, has been found to be
readily attenuated in mice by CB2 receptor agonists (Amenta
et al., 2012), as well as by inhibitors of FAAH (Tchantchou
et al., 2014) and MAGL (Zhang et al., 2014). Additionally,
FAAH inhibitors produce reductions in lesion volume, and
increased production of the heat shock proteins Hsp70, known
to be structurally protective, and Hsp72, a negative regulator
of apoptosis (Tchantchou et al., 2014). Tchantchou et al. (2014)
also showed that FAAH inhibition increased expression of the
anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2.
Several enzymes hydrolyze 2-AG including MAGL, which
accounts for an estimated 85% of its total hydrolysis, as well as
ABHD6 and ABHD12, which are responsible for much of the
remaining 15% (Blankman et al., 2007). Tchantchou and Zhang
(2013) found that inhibition of ABHD6 also reduced lesion

volume and lowered neurodegeneration in a mouse CCI model.
A CB1 receptor antagonist attenuated the protective effects on
lesion volume, while CB1 and CB2 receptor antagonists prevented
the protective effects on neurodegeneration (Tchantchou and
Zhang, 2013).
Combined, this evidence suggests that inhibitors of eCB
hydrolysis offer protection against TBI-induced cell death which
involve CB1 and CB2 receptors, though the distinction between
the eCBs remains to be clarified. Few studies have evaluated
interactions between anandamide and 2-AG in laboratory models
of TBI. One study using a model of cerebral focal ischemia
found that exogenously administered anandamide and 2-AG in
combination reduced infarct size in rats, but with no facilitatory
effects beyond anandamide or 2-AG alone (Wang et al., 2009).
Given the recent availability of dual FAAH/MAGL inhibitors
(Long et al., 2009; Niphakis et al., 2012), simultaneous blockade of
these enzymes following TBI may further reveal some insight into
the relationship between anandamide and 2-AG on TBI-induced
cell death.
Excitotoxicity
Previous efforts to attenuate the effects of excitotoxicity following
brain injury focused on NMDA receptor antagonists, presumably
with the understanding that the induction of depressed NMDA
receptor function would counteract TBI-induced excitotoxicity.
This class of drugs showed promise in laboratory animal models
of TBI (Shohami et al., 1995), but failed to produce long-
term beneficial outcomes in clinical trials, despite some acute
benefits of improved intracranial pressure and cerebral perfusion
pressure (Knoller et al., 2002; Maas et al., 2006). Research
investigating manipulations of the eCB system on glutamatergic
functioning following TBI have thus far focused primarily on 2-
AG, and paradoxically, its effectiveness to protect the integrity of
glutamate receptor function.
Several studies investigating the effects of cannabinoids in
laboratory animal models of TBI have focused on expression
changes of metabotropic (mGluR1, mGluR5), AMPA (GluA1,
GluA2), and NMDA (GluN1, GluN2A, GluN2B) glutamatergic
receptors. Specifically, post-injury administration of the MAGL
inhibitor JZL184 reversed TBI-induced reductions of GluN2A,
GluN2B, and GluA1 receptor expression, but with no impact
on GluN1 or GluA2 receptors (Zhang et al., 2014). The CB1
receptor antagonist Rimonabant did not alter injury-induced
lowered expression of mGluR1, but surprisingly reversed reduced
mGluR5 receptor expression 6 weeks following TBI (Wang
et al., 2016). Both findings were completed 30 days post injury
(Zhang et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2016), suggesting long term
changes in glutamatergic function following acute administration
of cannabinoids post-injury. However, little overlap is found
between receptor expression endpoints across papers. In an
example of contradictory patterns of GluA1 expression after
injury, GluA1 expression was reduced in a study that subjected
mice to a daily mild CHI on three consecutive days (Zhang et al.,
2014), and was increased in rats subjected to a single lateral fluid
percussion brain injury (Mayeux et al., 2016). In these studies,
MAGL inhibition ameliorated both the reduced (Zhang et al.,
2014) and increased (Mayeux et al., 2016) GluA1 expression.
As discussed above (see Pre-Clinical Evaluation of Cannabinoids
to Treat TBI), systematic investigation of species (mice vs. rat),
brain injury model, number of injuries, and other experimental
variables are needed to understand the consequences of brain
injury on glutamate receptor changes.
Endocannabinoids are known to depress glutamate release
from pre-synaptic terminals, and in particular, 2-AG has
been explored in its ability to influence the functioning of
electrochemical neurotransmission. MAGL inhibition has been
found to protect against injury-induced increases in frequency
and amplitude of EPSC in pyramidal neurons at the site of injury

Endocannabinoids and Traumatic Brain Injury
(Mayeux et al., 2016), which may suggest changes in pre-synaptic
transmitter release or post-synaptic strength (Zhang et al., 2005).
MAGL inhibition has also protected against injury-induced LTP
impairments at hippocampal CA3–
CA1 synapses (Zhang et al.,
2014), implicating the restoration of glutamate receptor function
in protection against TBI-induced memory impairments.
Finally, the excitotoxicity resulting from TBI is part of
the sequelae of events that lead to release of damaging ROS.
Antioxidants are known to prevent oxidation of free radicals and
thus protects against the cellular damage in response to sudden
ROS elevation. eCBs have been linked to the neuroprotective
production of antioxidants as the administration of exogenous
2-AG following injury has been found to increase levels of
antioxidants (Panikashvili et al., 2006).
Combined, these data suggest that MAGL represents a
promising target to reduce the damaging effects of injury-induced
excitotoxicity through complimentary molecular pathways.
Neuroinflammation
Hydrolytic enzymes of anandamide and 2-AG produce a shared
metabolic product in the formation of free AA, the major
substrate of the biosynthetic enzymes of pro-inflammatory
eicosanoids (Nomura et al., 2011). Therefore, eCB oxidation
not only produces inactivation at cannabinoid receptors, but
also leads to the production of bioactive lipids involved in
inflammatory responses during the early stages of injury.
Manipulations of the eCB system have proved effective in
downregulating inflammation in many experimental models,
such as inflammatory pain (Ahn et al., 2009), and multiple
sclerosis (Mestre et al., 2005). The use of cannabinoids following
TBI have thus far been linked to two predominant features
of inflammation; decreased inflammatory cell activation, and
decreases in pro-inflammatory cytokine production.
Pro-inflammatory

TBI-induced

(Kigerl
et
al.,
2009). Thus, decreasing TBI-inductions of inflammatory cell
activation is an attractive treatment strategy. MAGL inhibition
protects against TBI-induced microglial activation (Zhang et al.,
2014; Katz et al., 2015), while ABHD6 inhibition promotes
microglia/macrophage shift from a pro-inflammatory M1 to
an anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype (Tchantchou and Zhang,
2013). A parsimonious explanation for these findings is that
prevention of 2-AG hydrolysis leads to reduced levels of AA
and concomitant reductions of pro-inflammatory mediators.
Given the contribution of 2-AG catabolism to eicosanoid
production, it is unsurprising that several studies have reported
eCBs as demonstrating pro-inflammatory roles, some examples
of which include models of nephropathy (Mukhopadhyay
et al., 2010a), cardiomyopathy (Mukhopadhyay et al., 2010b),
and experimental dermatitis (Oka et al., 2006). Most of such
pro-inflammatory effects are attributed to 2-AG and not
anandamide, likely due to its considerable abundance over
anandamide. However, FAAH inhibition, similarly has been
found to protect against TBI-induced microglial activation (Katz
et al., 2015), as too has activation of CB2 receptors (Amenta
et al., 2012). Thus, a need exists to disentangle the potential
contributions of 2-AG to pro-inflammatory processes from its
role as a substrate for AA production, versus anti-inflammatory
effects through cannabinoid receptors, following TBI.
Inhibition of eCB degradative enzymes has also produced
decreases
in
TBI-induced

mediators.
Reductions in the expression of inducible enzymes that
trigger eicosanoid production following brain injury, COX-2
enzyme (which converts free AA to prostaglandins) and iNos
(which produces the free radical nitric oxide in response
to cytokine signaling), are seen in response to ABHD6
inhibition (Tchantchou and Zhang, 2013) and FAAH inhibition
(Tchantchou et al., 2014). Reductions in TBI-induced pro-
inflammatory cytokine mRNA (Il-1β, TNFα, and IL-6) have
also been found following treatment with exogenous 2-AG
(Panikashvili et al., 2006). These findings seem counter-intuitive
given the possibility of the rapid oxidation of 2-AG and its
consequent contribution to eicosanoid production. However,
exogenous 2-AG has also been shown to ameliorate TBI-induced
transactivation of the nuclear factor NF-kB (linked to cytokine
production) in wild type mice, but not in CB1 knockout mice,
suggesting that CB1 receptors mediate the protective effects of
exogenous 2-AG (Panikashvili et al., 2005).
Cerebrovascular Breakdown
The blood vessels which carry oxygen rich blood to the brain
are lined by endothelial cells as well as astrocytes. These cells,
combined with specific transport proteins and enzymes, strictly
regulate movement between the general circulation and CNS
extracellular fluid, and are collectively known as the BBB. TBI
has been well documented in producing cerebral blood flow
pathology (Kelly et al., 1997) as well as interfering with BBB
integrity (Bas
˛kaya et al., 1997). Given that cannabinoids are
known to exert vascular effects, producing vasodilation as well
as hypotension (reviewed in Hillard, 2000b), their manipulation
may hold promise as protectants against cerebrovascular damage.
Below, we review studies examining the effects of cannabinoids
on TBI-induced disruption of BBB integrity.
Exogenous administration of 2-AG (Panikashvili et al., 2006),
as well as MAGL inhibition (Katz et al., 2015), and ABHD6
inhibition (Tchantchou and Zhang, 2013) administered post-
injury protect against BBB breakdown. However, Panikashvili
et al., 2006 found that the expression of proteolytic enzymes
implicated in BBB breakdown were unaffected by exogenous 2-
AG post-injury. These enzymes include matrix metallopeptidase-
9 (MMP9) involved in extracellular matrix degradation, and
tumor necrosis factor-α-converting enzyme (TACE), which
cleaves membrane-bound proteins. The mechanism by which 2-
AG acts as a protectant of BBB integrity following traumatic
insult is yet to be resolved.
One study found that post-surgery administration of a FAAH
inhibitor protected against BBB breakdown (Katz et al., 2015),
suggesting that anandamide and/or other substrates of this
enzyme play a protective role. While the mechanism underlying
the structural protection of the BBB was not explored following
TBI, anandamide has been found to decrease BBB permeability
in a model of ischaemic stroke by transient receptor potential
cation channel, subfamily V, member 1 (TRPV1) (Hind et al.,
2015). Given that activation of TRPV1 receptors disrupts BBB

Endocannabinoids and Traumatic Brain Injury
integrity (Hu et al., 2005), it is possible that anandamide, as a
partial agonist at TRPV1 channels (Pertwee and Ross, 2002),
maybe be acting as a functional antagonist against a high efficacy
endogenous agonist to produce its structurally protective effects
of the cerebral microvascular endothelium. The exploration of
how anandamide may be exerting its protective effects of BBB
integrity may yet yield further novel targets for the treatment
of TBI.
In cerebral circulation, CB1 receptor activation produces
vasodilation. Indeed, the CB1 receptor antagonist rimonabant

and
hemorrhagic shock, as well as increasing survival (Varga et al.,
1998). Though cannabinoids are yet to be explored in the context
of TBI-induced changes in cerebral blood flow, CB1 receptor
antagonism may prove to be a potential target for the treatment
of TBI-induced hypotension.
Cell Structure/Remodeling
The key biological idea that structure dictates function also
holds true for the neurophysiology of TBI. The shearing and
tearing forces of TBI and subsequent secondary injury cascades
produce changes in cell architecture, extracellular matrices, and
the balance of fluid homeostasis, that impair neuronal function
often both in a focal and/or diffuse manner throughout the
brain (Gaetz, 2004). The use of cannabinoids has thus far been
linked to protection against several of the CNS structural changes
associated with TBI, with 2-AG being the most frequently studied
eCB in this area.
While a traumatic insult can result in the rapid onset
of cerebral oedema, exogenously administered 2-AG protects
against TBI-induced oedema (Panikashvili et al., 2001, 2005). The
observation that no such oedema protection was found following
2-AG administration in CB1 receptor−/− mice (Panikashvili
et al., 2005) suggests that this protection requires CB1 receptor
activation. Changes in protein physiology have also been found
to occur following TBI. Specifically, the presence of protein
aggregates such as amyloid-β plaques (Johnson et al., 2010),
p-tau (Goldstein et al., 2012), and TDP-43 (Smith et al., 1999),
have been found within hours following TBI. These proteins are
thought to accumulate from damaged axons and as a result of
a disturbed balance between genesis and catabolism (Johnson
et al., 2010). MAGL inhibitors decrease amyloid-β protein and
its precursor molecule APP, as well as p-tau and TDP-43 (Zhang
et al., 2014). MAGL inhibition also decreases astrocyte activation
(Mayeux et al., 2016), while exogenous 2-AG following TBI
reduces hippocampal CA-3 neuron loss (Panikashvili et al., 2001).
These consistent protective effects of 2-AG across varied TBI-
related structural pathologies point to its important role in
maintaining cell structure and promoting remodeling.
Protective roles played by anandamide in injury-induced
structural changes are yet to be ascertained. Though FAAH
inhibition decreases APP expression post-injury, as well as
increases synaptophysin (Tchantchou et al., 2014), a synaptic
vesicle protein whose elimination impairs object recognition and
spatial learning in mice (Schmitt et al., 2009). Furthermore,
eCBs may not be working alone to offer protection from TBI-
induced structural impairments. For example, estradiol decreased
the number of TBI-induced immunoreactive astrocytes, which
was inhibited by CB1 and CB2 receptor antagonists, while
also increasing cerebral cortex mRNA levels of CB2 receptors
(Lopez Rodriguez et al., 2011). These findings suggest that the
regulatory activity of the eCB receptors in response to TBI
may be mediated by endocrine as well as paracrine signaling
mechanisms.
Traumatic brain injury is well described to increase CB1 and
CB2 receptor expression, which includes disruption of diurnal
rhythms of CB1 receptor expression (Martinez-Vargas et al.,
2013). Post-injury treatment with a CB1 receptor antagonist
reduces CB1 receptor expression at 6 weeks following injury
(Wang et al., 2016), whereas ABHD6 inhibition produces
increased CB1
and CB2
receptor expression (Tchantchou
and
Zhang,
2013).
As
such,
TBI-induced
increases
in
cannabinoid receptor expression are perhaps facilitated by
2-AG.
Neurogenic Pulmonary Oedema
Pulmonary complications are reported in 20–
25% of TBI patients
(Holland et al., 2003), and its severity is related to brain injury
magnitude (Alvarez et al., 2015). The exact CNS circuits involved
in NPE have yet to be identified, though a sudden rise in
intracranial pressure, rapid sympathetic surge, increased systemic
vascular resistance and increase in hydrostatic pressure in the
pulmonary vasculature, as well as release of pro-inflammatory
mediators may all contribute to interstitial pulmonary oedema
formation (Brambrink and Dick, 1997). NPE rapidly occurs
within hours of TBI onset in clinical populations (Alvarez et al.,
2015), and within minutes in animal models (Atkinson et al.,
1998), producing CNS hypoxia (Oddo et al., 2010) which further
contributes to secondary injury. NPE is a much needed area of
interest in the study of TBI.
While at the present time there are no studies evaluating
the contributions of, or protection by, the eCB system to NPE
following TBI, this may prove an interesting area of future
investigation. Specifically, the lung possesses a basal tone of 2-
AG (Avraham et al., 2008; Nomura et al., 2008), and recently it
has been shown that resident lung macrophages express major
components of the eCB system, CB1 and CB2 receptors as well
as anandamide and 2-AG (Staiano et al., 2015). Furthermore,
MAGL inhibition has already been found to be protective against
LPS-induced acute lung injury in mice, and attenuated with CB1
and CB2 receptor antagonists (Costola-de-Souza et al., 2013).

wide breadth of TBI clinical effects yet to be studied. Once
again, components of the eCB system may become active to
compensate for TBI symptomology given what is currently
known of its regulatory effects within these areas, two examples
being pain, and anxiety and depression (Corcoran et al.,
2015).
In this section, we review what is currently known of
cannabinoids in the context of their ability to alter post-traumatic
animal behavior (see Table 2).
Learning and Memory
Learning and memory impairments are among the most
frequently reported symptoms following TBI, and are slow to
recover with deficiencies reported 10 years later (Zec et al., 2001).
The eCB system has been shown to play a well-documented
role in memory regulation (reviewed in Mechoulam and Parker,
2011), and as such its manipulation holds considerable promise
to address such a profound consequence of TBI.
Inhibition of the eCB hydrolytic enzymes FAAH (Tchantchou
et al., 2014), MAGL (Zhang et al., 2014), and ABHD6
(Tchantchou and Zhang, 2013) have been shown to protect
against TBI-induced memory impairments, suggesting that
anandamide and 2-AG elevation post-TBI may offer protection
from TBI-induced learning and memory deficits. The protective
effects of 2-AG appear to be task specific, with ABHD6
inhibition showing learning and memory protection in a
Y-maze task, but not a Morris water maze task. To date,
only a Y-maze task has been used to evaluate the memory

Endocannabinoids and Traumatic Brain Injury
protective effects of FAAH inhibition, and this task-specific
effect did not occur with a MAGL inhibitor. Mice are a
well-used pre-clinical model organism to study the memory
effects of TBI; however, they are known to perform behavioral
tasks more readily, and with less error, when the task
does not rely on aversive motivation (Stranahan, 2011). This
attribute of mice may, in some part, contribute to the task-
related differences seen between the Y-maze task (which
uses exploratory behaviors associated with novelty) and the
aversively motivated escape behavior necessary in the Morris
water maze. Regardless, in clinical populations the most
common memory process vulnerable to TBI involves difficulties
applying active or effortful strategy’
s in the learning or retrieval
process (Vakil, 2005). Moving forward, the use of behavioral
tasks able to selectively assess such frontal lobe-type memory
impairments might improve the translational capacity of eCB
TBI pre-clinical assessments (one such example being the
Morris water maze Reversal Task, which evaluates cognitive
flexibility).
Neurological Motor
Traumatic brain injury-induced neurological motor impairments
currently represent the most frequently studied behavioral
outcome
measure
in
the
TBI-cannabinoid
literature.
In

(Walker
and Pickett, 2007). A variety of eCB system manipulations
have thus far been found to be protective against the
neurological motor deficits associated with murine models
of TBI.
Both 2-AG and anandamide elevation provide protection
against
TBI-induced
neurological
motor
deficits.
MAGL
inhibitors (Zhang et al., 2014; Katz et al., 2015; Mayeux et al.,
2016), ABHD6 inhibitors (Tchantchou and Zhang, 2013), and
exogenous 2-AG administration (Panikashvili et al., 2001),
improve NSS in laboratory animal models of TBI. Moreover,
ABHD6 inhibition also protects against TBI-induced rotarod
deficits (Tchantchou and Zhang, 2013). Administration of
exogenous 2-AG did not enhance NSS scores in CB1 receptor
knockout mice subjected to TBI (Panikashvili et al., 2005),
suggesting a CB1
receptor mechanism of action. FAAH
inhibition has produced mixed findings in neurological motor
tests, such as beam-walk deficit protection (Tchantchou et al.,
2014) but no improvement on TBI-induced NSS deficits
(Katz et al., 2015). In support of anandamide being protective
against TBI-induced motor deficits, exogenous anandamide
has also produced improved NSS performance (Martinez-
Vargas et al., 2013). Full reversal, and partial reversal, of FAAH
inhibitor mediated beam-walk deficit protection by respective
CB2 and CB1 receptor antagonists (Tchantchou et al., 2014),
suggest a role of both of these receptors in anandamide’
s

effects.
The
involvement
of
the CB2 receptor is further supported by rotarod deficit
protection from a CB2 receptor agonist (Amenta et al.,
2012).
The role of entourage effects has also been evaluated in
the area of TBI-induced neurological motor impairments. Co-
release of endogenous fatty acid derivatives can potentiate 2-
AG signaling, termed an entourage effect (Ben-Shabat et al.,
1998; Lambert and Di Marzo, 1999; Lichtman et al., 2002).
Administration of 2-AG with two related lipids that do
not bind cannabinoid receptors, 2-LG and 2-PG, enhances
recovery from TBI-induced NSS deficits (Panikashvili et al.,
2001). Given FAAH is responsible for the degradation of
various fatty acid amides in addition to anandamide (Boger
et al., 2000), its various substrates may work in concert to
ameliorate pathologies related to TBI. Thus any inferences
drawn about anandamide through the use of FAAH inhibition
needs to consider contributions of non-cannabinoid fatty acid
amides.
Anxiety and Post-Traumatic Seizures
The signs of post-traumatic anxiety have been difficult to
replicate in murine models of TBI (Tucker et al., 2016). Also,
as there is a limited number of studies evaluating eCBs in
this area, no definitive conclusions can be made. Thus far,
only FAAH inhibition has been explored to address post-
traumatic anxiety, and was found to protect against TBI-induced
increases in anxiety-like behavior in mice (Tchantchou et al.,
2014). This protection in the zero maze was unaffected by
either CB1 or CB2 receptor antagonists, suggesting that these
receptors are dispensable. Modeling post-traumatic epilepsy is
time consuming and faces other challenges such as a low
percentage of animals that develop epilepsy (Mazarati, 2006),
however, recent models that produce consistent replication of
spontaneous seizure activity following a TBI are available (Ping
and Jin, 2016). Contrary to preclinical research demonstrating
that the eCB system plays a protective roles against seizures
(Wallace et al., 2001; Marsicano et al., 2003), a CB1 receptor
antagonist has protected against injury-induced seizure threshold
deficits as well as lowered seizure mortality (Wang et al.,
2016), potentially through the disinhibition of GABAergic
terminals.
This nascent body of data, suggests that eCB manipulations
hold promise to treat injury-induced clinical symptoms outside
of the more popular areas of learning and memory and
neurological motor impairments.
PRIMARY PHYTOCANNABINOIDS AND
TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY
Although currently well over one hundred phytocannabinoids
have been elucidated from the Cannabis sativa plant (Elsohly
et al., 2017), the most extensively studied of these are THC and
cannabidiol (CBD). The investigation of phytocannabinoids on
TBI pathology not only holds topical relevance, but also but
also holds promise as potential treatment for TBI and other
disorders.
Without exception, all of the experimental work reviewed
and listed in Tables 1 and 2 have used post-injury drug
administration times ranging from 15 min to several days,

Endocannabinoids and Traumatic Brain Injury
clearly an attempt to simulate clinical intervention timing
possibilities. However, clinical and pre-clinical findings provide
evidence suggesting that the primary psychoactive constituent
of Cannabis sativa, THC, is neuroprotective when administered
prior to a traumatic insult. In a 3 year retrospective study
of patients who had sustained a TBI, urine toxicology screen
results showed decreased mortality in individuals with a positive
THC screen (Nguyen et al., 2014). In two mouse models
of CNS injury that yield cognitive deficits, pentylenetetrazole
(an excitotoxic agent) and carbon monoxide induced hypoxic
injury, prior administration of THC provided impairment
protection (Assaf et al., 2011). Curiously, an extraordinarily
a low dose of THC (i.e., 0.002 mg.kg−1) reduced injury-
induced cognitive deficits in mice (Assaf et al., 2011). The
authors explained this effect through the known biphasic
effects of THC producing analgesia, acute hypothermia, and
decreased locomotion at high doses (10 mg.kg−1), and producing
hyperalgesia, hyperthermia, and increased locomotion at a low
dose (0.002 mg.kg−1) (reviewed in Sarne et al., 2011). Such
low dose effects of THC have been found to potentiate calcium
entry into cells in vitro (Okada et al., 1992), increasing glutamate
release, and thus may be mildly neurotoxic. Therefore, Assaf
et al. (2011) hypothesized that low dose THC pre-treatment
produced a pre-conditioning effect, where a mildly noxious
stimulus becomes protective against a more severe subsequent
insult, an effect known to occur in cardiology (Dirnagl et al.,
2003) as well as cerebral ischaemia (Kitagawa et al., 1991).
Moreover, the molecular signaling cascades behind cardiac and
cerebral ischaemia preconditioning include activation of ERK
and Akt (Dirnagl et al., 2003; Gidday, 2006), also shown to
mediate the protective effects of ABHDB (Tchantchou and
Zhang, 2013) and MAGL (Mayeux et al., 2016) inhibition
following TBI.
Even though 80–
90% of THC is excreted from individuals
within 5 days of administration, the remaining slow release
of lipophilic THC from lipid-storage compartments result in
its long terminal half-life in plasma (Huestis, 2007). As such,
individuals may experience very low plasma THC concentrations
for prolonged periods after each application. Although the
clinical study of TBI-induced mortality reported no data to
quantify levels of THC in the THC positive individuals, the low
dose THC in CNS injured mice may mimic the pharmacokinetics
of THC in humans. This presumed prolonged exposure of
THC due to its pharmacokinetics, as well as other potentially
neuroprotective cannabinoids, such as CBD (Perez et al., 2013),
may be responsible for the survival effects found in cannabis-
exposed TBI patients. A finding of increased clinical relevance,
is that post-conditioning (when the mildly noxious stimulus
is applied after the insult) with low dose THC also produced
cognitive sparing effects in mice (Assaf et al., 2011). These
findings, however, remain controversial, and are yet to be
replicated in animal models of TBI.
The phytocannabinoid CBD, currently being investigated in
clinical trials for its seizure reduction potential in Tuberous
Sclerosis Complex (Gw Research Ltd, 2016), has known anti-
inflammatory properties. Although CBD does not bind CB1
and CB2 receptors, it activates the g-protein coupled receptor
GPR55 (Ryberg et al., 2007), inhibits nucleoside transporter 1
(Carrier et al., 2006), inhibits sodium channels (Hill et al., 2014),
and produces increased extracellular adenosine concentrations
that consequently downregulate inflammatory cells through the
adenosine A2A receptor (Ohta and Sitkovsky, 2001; Hasko and
Pacher, 2008). While there are no studies at present which
have investigated the anti-inflammatory effects of CBD following
TBI, CBD has reduced FosB expression following cryogenic
spinal cord injury (Kwiatkoski et al., 2012), and lowered iNos
expression in a mouse model of tauopathy (Casarejos et al.,
2013). As such CBD may be a promising future avenue of
investigation in the study of neuroinflammation in response to
brain injury.
CONCLUDING REMARKS AND FUTURE
DIRECTIONS
The eCB system, through release of its endogenous ligands
or by changes in cannabinoid receptor constitutive activity,
possesses promise in the treatment of diverse TBI pathology.
An important step forward in understanding the role that
the eCB system plays in TBI pathology includes not only
the full characterization of ligands targeting cannabinoid
receptors and eCB regulating enzymes, but also changes in
cannabinoid receptors, eCB levels, and eCB regulating enzymes
as a consequence of TBI. Another future area of therapeutic
interest is non-CB1/CB2 receptor targets, such as TRPV1
receptors, and their potential contribution to the protective
effects following TBI. Furthermore, alternative activation of
CB1/CB2 receptors, such as potential entourage effects from
other fatty acid derivatives, antagonism, or allosteric modulation,
might
impact
functional
selectivity
and
thus
TBI-related
outcomes also warrants further investigation. So too do the
plant-derived phytocannabinoids represent an understudied yet
promising group of compounds given the neuroprotective
results obtained from other types of CNS injury. In particular,
CBD as well as other phytocannabinoids which do not bind
cannabinoid receptors, represent promising molecules to treat
TBI.
To date, the only reported cannabinoid to be specifically
evaluated for the treatment of TBI in patient populations
is
Dexanabinol,
also
known
as
HU211.
While
HU211
showed promise in animal models of TBI (Shohami et al.,
1995), it failed to produce long term patient outcomes
in one clinical trial despite some acute benefits (Knoller
et al., 2002), and in a second study showed no short or
long term benefits (Maas et al., 2006). Although HU211
has been described as a cannabinoid by virtue that it is
an enantiomer of the potent synthetic cannabinoid agonist
HU210, it does not bind or activate cannabinoid receptors.
Instead, HU211acts as a non-competitive NMDA receptor
antagonist (Feigenbaum et al., 1989). This therefore brings
to light an important consideration of the classification of
cannabinoids.
One consistently overlooked area across the study of TBI is the
evaluation of the central penetration of systemically administered

drugs. Pharmacological treatments will need to be assessed for
their ability to cross the BBB. Also, it should be noted that
TBI rapidly disrupts the BBB and lasts for three days post-
injury (Bas
˛kaya et al., 1997). Furthermore, given the often
biphasic nature of cannabinoid drugs, it is critical to move
away from single dose pharmacology to full dose-response
assessments, which may yield an increased understanding of
the mechanism and potential of cannabinoids to treat TBI.
Overall, the abundant and growing pre-clinical research suggests
that the eCB system possesses many promising targets for
new and existing drugs that may ameliorate diverse TBI
pathology.
