In Brief
Natural killer cells can acquire properties
that are consistent with features of
immunological memory. Hornung and
colleagues show that the contact-
sensitizer monobenzone induces
pigment cell-specific memory NK cells,
while the NLRP3 inflammasome serves as
a critical and non-redundant
proinflammatory checkpoint in the
formation of this memory NK cell
response.

SUMMARY
Monobenzone is a pro-hapten that is exclusively
metabolized by melanocytes, thereby haptenizing
melanocyte-specific antigens, which results in cyto-
toxic autoimmunity specifically against pigmented
cells. Studying monobenzone in a setting of contact
hypersensitivity (CHS), we observed that monoben-
zone induced a long-lasting, melanocyte-specific im-
mune response that was dependent on NK cells, yet
fully intact in the absence of T- and B cells. Consis-
tent with the concept of ‘‘memory NK cells,’’ mono-
benzone-induced NK cells resided in the liver and
transfer of these cells conferred melanocyte-specific
immunity to naive animals. Monobenzone-exposed
skin displayed macrophage infiltration and cuta-
neous lymph nodes showed an inflammasome-
dependent influx of macrophages with a tissue-
resident phenotype, coinciding with local NK cell
activation. Indeed, macrophage depletion or the
absence of the NLRP3 inflammasome, the adaptor
protein
ASC
or
interleukin-18
(IL-18)
abolished
monobenzone CHS, thereby establishing a non-
redundant role for the NLRP3 inflammasome as a
critical proinflammatory checkpoint in the induction
of hapten-dependent memory NK cells.
INTRODUCTION
During the last decade, a growing body of evidence has demon-
strated—against
the
classical
dogma—that
immunological
memory can be established within cells of the innate immune
system. Indeed, compelling evidence has been provided that
natural killer (NK) cells can acquire properties that are consistent
with features of immunological memory, a function that tradition-
ally had only been attributed to T and B cells (O’Sullivan et al.,
2015). To this effect, it has been found that NK cells can readily
respond to a previously encountered antigen, with this response
being long-lived and highly specific. In mice, three distinct types
of ‘‘memory NK cells’’ have been reported, differing in their phe-
notypes, their patterns of tissue distribution, the types of anti-
gens being recognized and their mechanisms of induction
(Min-Oo et al., 2013). The first evidence for NK cells displaying
memory-like functions has come from studies conducted in
mice deficient in T and B cells. In these mice, contact sensitizers
were still able to elicit specific and long-lasting immune re-
sponses, albeit to a lower extent compared to T and B cell
competent mice. This phenomenon could be ascribed to a spe-
cial population of NK cells, residing in the liver (O’Leary et al.,
2006). On the other hand, NK cells can also develop functional
memory populations during murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV)
infection, dependent on recognition of the virus-encoded protein
m157 (Arase et al., 2002) by Ly49H-receptors (Sun et al., 2009).
Given the fact that these NK cells can be phenotypically tracked,
the MCMV model has provided important insights into the forma-
tion of virus-specific memory NK cells. Finally, cytokine treat-
ment of NK cells ex vivo (with IL-12, IL-15, and IL-18) can lead
to a long-lasting memory-like phenotype that is characterized
by an enhanced interferon-g (IFN-g) production upon re-stimula-
tion and the capacity to suppress murine tumor outgrowth
(Cooper et al., 2009; Ni et al., 2012). These ‘‘cytokine trained’’
NK cells are not restricted to a specific antigen and they have
been shown to also exist in the human setting (Romee et al.,
2012). Of note, features consistent with antigen-specific NK
cell memory have recently been demonstrated in macaques,
making it very likely that such NK cell responses also exist in
the human system (Reeves et al., 2015). Memory NK cells are
not the only cells uniting innate and adaptive traits, and they
need to be importantly set aside from innate-like T cells. This
cell type unites certain characteristics of both NK cells and
CD8+ memory T cells and is found in both mouse and man, but
does not have a pure NK cell phenotype (Van Kaer, 2015).
The MCMV model has allowed thorough characterization of
the induction and function of m157-specific memory NK cells,
yet it remains unclear whether their traits and functionalities

 extend to the concept of NK cell memory in general. The hapten-
specific NK cells probably most intimately exemplify memory
NK cells responsive to tissue stress, as it might be found in
multiple pathologies like cancer, autoimmunity, or infection.
For the hapten-specific NK cells though, it is not clear where
and how these memory NK cells are ‘‘primed’’ and whether
this requires an additional innate immune-derived verification
signal, as it is known for T and B cell memory (Smith-Garvin
et al., 2009).
The most selective contact sensitizer known is monobenzone
(monobenzylether of hydroquinone). Its selectivity is caused by
its characteristic of being a pro-hapten (Kaplan et al., 2012),
only activated in pigmented cells by the melanosomal enzyme
tyrosinase (van den Boorn et al., 2011a). Thereby, the hapten
can only be generated in pigmented cells, the melanocytes,
and the resultant CHS only occurs in pigmented skin (Nordlund
et al., 1985). As a result of tyrosinase-mediated activation,
monobenzone inhibits melanocyte pigment synthesis (van den
Boorn et al., 2011b), most potently depigmenting the exposed
skin. As such, its application represents an exogenous cause
for vitiligo, and it has thereby been applied therapeutically as a
depigmenting agent for vitiligo universalis in patients who
prefer complete depigmentation over repigmentation strategies
(AlGhamdi and Kumar, 2011). Unfortunately, also in healthy indi-
viduals, monobenzone induces systemic vitiligo rather than
containable hypopigmentation (Catona and Lanzer, 1987; For-
man, 1953).
RESULTS
Monobenzone Contact Hypersensitivity Is Memory NK
Cell-Driven
We have previously shown that monobenzone treatment can
initiate a melanocyte-directed immune response that is primarily
driven by CD8+ T cells and NK cells (van den Boorn et al., 2010).
In these studies, monobenzone was repetitively applied over a
prolonged period of time and adjuvanted with Toll-like receptor
(TLR) ligands to achieve maximal immunogenicity and as such
potent anti-tumor (melanoma) activity. Additional studies have
revealed the melanocyte-based mode of action of monobenzone
(Figure S1) and illustrated that monobenzone can already induce
a considerable immune response by itself in the absence of addi-
tional pattern recognition receptor (PRR) engagement (van den
Boorn et al., 2011b; 2011a). To study the mechanism of mono-
benzone-dependent immunogenicity more closely, we decided
to apply it in a classical contact hypersensitivity (CHS) setting
that would provide a sensitive readout for its inherent immunos-
timulatory activity. To this end, we first applied monobenzone on
the shaved abdomen of mice (sensitization) and then re-applied
monobenzone on their ear 1 and 2 weeks later (elicitation), where
ear swelling was recorded as surrogate marker of CHS (Gad
et al., 1986).
Similar
to the established
contact-sensitizer
oxazolone,
monobenzone was able to induce a classical CHS ear swelling
response, albeit to a lesser extent and with slightly different
kinetics (Figure 1A and Figure S2A). Of note, in contrast to oxa-
zolone, four repetitive daily applications were needed for mono-
benzone CHS to establish, whereas one or two exposures did
not suffice to install its CHS (data not shown). Monobenzone
sensitization followed by an oxazolone elicitation (or vice versa)
did not evoke CHS, and monobenzone elicitations on naive
mice also did not induce any ear swelling (Figure 1B and data
not shown), indicating the hapten-specific nature of monoben-
zone-induced CHS.
Characterizing the cellular infiltrate of the elicited ears revealed
that monobenzone recruited a CD45+ cell population that selec-
tively consisted of NK cells positive for CD49b and NK1.1. Oxa-
zolone in contrast recruited a much larger CD45+ cellular
infiltrate, fitting with its more intense CHS ear swelling, that con-
sisted of a mixed CD4+ and CD8+ T and NK cell effector popula-
tion (Figures 1C and 1D). Although both compounds recruited
comparable numbers of CD49b+ cells into the ear, there was a
profound difference in infiltrating cells positive for NK1.1 (Fig-
ure 1D). Closer investigation showed monobenzone-induced
CD49b+ NK cells nearly all co-expressed NK1.1, whereas only
two-thirds of the oxazolone-recruited CD49b+ NK cells dis-
played this double-positive phenotype characteristic of more
mature NK cells (Figure S2B). The monobenzone-specific NK
cell infiltrate was positive for Ly49C-I lectin-type receptors and
CD18 (LFA-1), indicating that these cells were licensed effector
NK cells (Figure 1E) (Long et al., 2013). Of note, this monoben-
zone-dependent recruitment of NK cells to the ear effector site
was hapten specific. Indeed, oxazolone elicitation of monoben-
zone-sensitized mice did not recruit NK cells into the ear, as it
was readily seen for monobenzone (Figure 1F). Together, these
results indicate that monobenzone shows characteristics of a
classical CHS hapten-driven immune response with a predomi-
nant NK cell infiltration upon elicitation.

 Tissue-Specificity of Monobenzone CHS Is Conserved in
Rag2–/– Mice
To further elucidate the nature of the effector cell population in
the monobenzone CHS response, we next performed monoben-
zone sensitization and elicitation experiments in Rag2�/� mice.
These mice lack both functional T and B cells, yet are fully
competent for NK cells (Shinkai et al., 1992). Rag2�/� mice could
effectively mount an ear swelling response upon monobenzone
sensitization and subsequent elicitation (Figure 2A), indicating
that monobenzone CHS is independent of T and B cells. NK
cell depletion during oxazolone treatment did not impact on
CHS progression, which indicates NK cells not to be crucial to
its CHS induction. Conversely, NK cells were critical to the
monobenzone memory response because the CHS response
to monobenzone elicitation was fully abolished in wild-type
mice that had been depleted of NK cells (Figure 2B).
Rag2�/� animals that had been sensitized with monobenzone
and underwent weekly CHS elicitation for 4 months developed
vitiligo at distant skin sites (Figure 2C and Figure S3A), suggest-
ing that monobenzone-induced NK-cells exerted systemic cyto-
toxic responses against melanocytes. To further address the
role of melanocyte-directed NK cell cytotoxicity, we studied
mice challenged with the pigmented melanoma cell line B16.
Following subcutaneous implantation of B16 melanoma cells in
wild-type mice local monobenzone treatment induced additional
tumor-infiltration with NK cells, but not T cells (Figure S3B). In line
with these observations, Rag2�/� mice that had undergone pre-
vious sensitization with monobenzone, displayed repression of
B16 melanoma outgrowth, while naive animals showed rapid
B16 tumor development (Figure 2D). Tumor repression coin-
cided with an increased frequency of activated NK cells infil-
trating respective tumors (Figure 2E). Moreover, an almost
complete inhibition of tumor outgrowth was observed when
mice were monobenzone-sensitized and underwent weekly elic-
itations for 4 months prior to tumor engraftment (Figure S3C). On
the other hand, Rag2�/� mice that received an NK cell-sensitive
non-pigmented methylcholanthrene (MCA)-induced sarcoma
(O’Sullivan et al., 2012) following monobenzone-sensitization,
did not repress the outgrowth of this tumor (Figure 2F). In addi-
tion, MCA205 tumors of monobenzone-sensitized mice did not
display augmented infiltration with activated NK cells (Figure 2G).
Ex vivo co-culture experiments of NK cells from naive or
monobenzone-sensitized Rag2�/� mice implanted with B16
melanoma cells corroborated these findings: NK cells from
monobenzone-sensitized mice displayed higher cytotoxic activ-
ity against B16 melanoma cells or the syngeneic pigmented mel-
anoma cell line HCmel3 (Landsberg et al., 2012) than NK cells
from naive mice. On the other hand, both NK cell populations
displayed similar activation when co-cultured with non-pig-
mented MCA205 sarcoma cells (Figure 2H).
Taken together, these results demonstrate that monobenzone
CHS depends on NK cells and that these cells exerted a specific
cytotoxic activity against pigmented cells in vivo and ex vivo.
Importantly, these experiments suggest that monobenzone
elicits an acquired NK cell immune response consistent with
the concept of ‘‘memory NK cells.’’
Monobenzone NK Cell Memory Is Transferrable to Naive
Animals
Hapten-induced memory NK cells reside in the liver following
their induction and they can be adoptively transferred into naive
hosts to provide hapten-specific immunity (O’Leary et al., 2006).
To confirm the memory capabilities of the monobenzone-
induced NK cells and determine whether an NK cell memory
population indeed resides in monobenzone-sensitized mice,
we purified NK cells from livers and spleens of monobenzone-
sensitized animals. Such NK cells were then transferred to naive
wild-type host mice that were subsequently challenged with
monobenzone. In line with memory NK cell formation, only adop-
tively transferred hepatic NK cells were capable of inducing a
recall CHS response upon elicitation with monobenzone, in an
otherwise naive host animal, whereas splenic NK cells could
not provide immunological memory (Figure 3A). The NK-cell-
dependent immunological memory in monobenzone-treated
mice was long lasting, given the fact that monobenzone-induced
ear swelling could be elicited as late as 4 months after initial
sensitization (Figure 3B). To study the hapten-specific tissue-
homing capacity of monobenzone-induced NK cells, we made
use of the congenic markers CD45.1 and CD45.2 to trace adop-
tively transferred NK cells. CD45.2+ hepatic NK cells from mono-
benzone-sensitized mice homed back to the CD45.1+ recipient’s
liver and were neither detected in naive skin nor in lymph nodes,
blood, or spleen (Figure 3C). Upon monobenzone elicitation of
the recipient mice, the adoptively transferred CD45.2+ NK cells

 readily homed to the elicited ear. Interestingly, this phenomenon
was not observed when oxazolone was used to alternatively
elicit these mice (Figure 3D), indicating specificity in triggering
memory NK cell accumulation in elicited skin.
Additional phenotyping studies revealed that monobenzone
sensitization induced expression of the activating receptor
NKG2D on hepatic NK cells, however not on splenic NK cells
(Figure 3E). This NKG2D expression was retained on CD45.2+
NK cells amidst the native population of naive hepatic NK cells
upon transfer into the CD45.1+ recipients (Figure 3F), indicating
in vivo preservation of their activated phenotype, at least within
the time frame studied. Blocking NKG2D in the course of mono-
benzone sensitization and elicitation largely blunted the CHS
response, indicating that this route of NK-cell activation was crit-
ically required to confer the monobenzone-driven memory NK
cell response (Figure 3G). Of note, the antibody used to inhibit
NKG2D interactions did not deplete CD49b+ or NK1.1+ cells
in vivo (Figure 3H).
Altogether, these data reveal that monobenzone-induced
memory NK cells reside in the liver, acquire and retain high
NKG2D
expression
following
compound-sensitization,
and
exhibit hapten-specific infiltration of target tissues.
Macrophages Infiltrate Monobenzone-Exposed Skin
Having established that monobenzone treatment induced a
bona fide memory NK cell response, we next investigated the
mechanisms of its induction. Gene-expression analysis of
monobenzone-exposed skin revealed strong induction of che-
mokines associated with macrophage or monocyte migration
and to a lesser extent chemokines associated with lymphocyte
trafficking (Figure S4). Histological analysis of the skin during
the sensitization phase revealed that monobenzone recruited
CD45+ leukocytes nested predominantly around the hair folli-
cles, the location where melanocytes are found (Figure 4A, upper
versus lower two rows). The infiltrating cells had a clear interdigi-
tary appearance (Figure 4A, lower row) and strongly stained for
F4/80, while being negative for Gr-1 (Ly6G and Ly6C). In
contrast, oxazolone attracted CD45+ cells mainly into the upper
layers of the dermis and epidermis, where its main haptenizing
action takes place. Besides a strong presence of F4/80 positive
cells that infiltrated the skin in a likewise diffuse pattern as seen
with monobenzone, the vast majority of the infiltrate located in
the upper layers of the skin expressed Gr-1 (Figure 4A, second
row). Additional flow cytometric analysis of monobenzone-
exposed skin confirmed our observations of CD45+ leukocytes
being attracted to the skin. Among these, macrophages dis-
played the largest increase, whereas the frequency of Langer-
hans cells or conventional dendritic cells remained unchanged
(Figure 4B). These data suggested that Langerhans cells, which
can also express F4/80 in the skin, were not involved in the
monobenzone-induced CHS response. In line with this assump-
tion, depletion of Langerhans cells during monobenzone CHS
did not affect the ear swelling response (data not shown).
Altogether, these data indicated that monobenzone installs an
inflammatory milieu in the exposed skin poised to engage
macrophages.
Lymph Nodes Are Crucially Involved in the Installment of
NK Memory
A number of studies have shown that the induction of classical
CHS responses requires the encounter of naive T cells with
hapten-presenting dendritic cells (DC) in skin-draining lymph
nodes (Grabbe and Schwarz, 1998). A similar scenario has
been suggested for the priming of hapten-specific memory NK
cells, as blocking of the homing receptor CD62L partially atten-
uates memory NK cell responses (O’Leary et al., 2006).
In fact, mice lacking CCR7, the chemokine receptor that di-
rects the migration of leukocytes to draining lymph nodes,
showed an abolished CHS response in the monobenzone model
(Figure 5A). To further explore the role of the local draining lymph
node in the induction of monobenzone-directed NK cell memory,
we transferred lymph node cells derived from monobenzone- or
mock-treated animals to naive mice. Studying the monoben-
zone-dependent recall response in these animals, revealed
that the transfer of lymph node cells derived from monoben-
zone-sensitized, but not mock-treated animals, was sufficient
to render mice sensitive toward monobenzone (Figure 5B).
Next, we analyzed the draining lymph nodes from monoben-
zone-, oxazolone-, or vehicle-exposed mice in the middle of their
sensitization period by flow cytometry. Interestingly, monoben-
zone did not recruit MHC class-IIhi CD11c+ cells to the lymph
node, whereas oxazolone did. These results implied that mono-
benzone was incapable of mobilizing classic DC types to the
lymph node (Figure 5C, left panel). As such, we focused on the
Figure 3. Monobenzone CHS Is Transferrable to Naive Animals by Hepatic NK Cells

 recruitment of macrophages employing CD64, CD11c, and
CX3CR1 to define distinct macrophage subpopulations (Bain
et al., 2013; Tamoutounour et al., 2012; Weber et al., 2011).
Combined CD64 and CD11c� or dim expression was used to
identify macrophages in general, whereas intermediate or high
CX3CR1 expression was used to define ‘‘inflammatory’’ or ‘‘tis-
sue resident’’ macrophages, respectively (Figure S5A). Both
compounds recruited CD64+ CD11c� or dim macrophages to
the lymph node (Figure 5C, second panel). However, while oxa-
zolone attracted large numbers of both inflammatory and resi-
dent macrophages, monobenzone predominantly mobilized
tissue-resident macrophages and only a small fraction of inflam-
matory macrophages (Figure 5C, third and fourth panel). Addi-
tional analysis of these tissue-resident macrophages revealed
that they also expressed F4/80 and CD11b, firmly establishing
their macrophage phenotype (Figure S5B). These results indi-
cated that CHS induction by monobenzone relied on the lymph
node recruitment of macrophages, in particular ones with a tis-
sue-resident phenotype, yet not on the mobilization of classic
DCs. Importantly, the arrival of such macrophages in the lymph
node coincided with the local activation of NK cells for both com-
pounds (Figure 5D).
To further characterize the role of macrophages in this pro-
cess, we treated animals using carrageenan, which led to a sig-
nificant reduction in skin macrophage presence, in particular of
the tissue-resident phenotype (Figure 5E). Depleting macro-
phages using carrageenan in the course of both monobenzone
sensitization and elicitation resulted in a near-complete inhibition
of monobenzone induced CHS (Figure 5F). Moreover, depleting
macrophages selectively during the CHS elicitation phase also
inhibited the ear swelling response (Figure 5G).
In summary, these data reveal that monobenzone-triggered
memory NK cell formation requires lymph node homing, with
the migration of macrophages into the local lymph node being
a requirement for its CHS response.
Monobenzone-Triggered Memory NK Cell Induction
Requires the NLRP3 Inflammasome
Previous reports have shown that the induction of CHS by
various haptens depends on the engagement of the NLRP3 in-
flammasome (Sutterwala et al., 2006; Watanabe et al., 2007;
Weber et al., 2010), with the activation of the purinergic receptor
P2X7 being a possible upstream event of NLRP3 activation
(Weber et al., 2010). Interestingly, P2X7 deficiency did not result
in deterioration of the monobenzone CHS ear swelling response,
whereas sensitization of mice that were deficient for NLRP3 or its
adaptor protein ASC were unable to establish monobenzone-
dependent CHS (Figures 6A–6C). At the same time, mice defi-
cient in the inflammasome-dependent cytokine IL-18 were also
incapable of mounting an ear swelling response in the context
of monobenzone treatment (Figure 6D). In line with these data,
the recruitment of NK cells into the ear during monobenzone
elicitation was completely abolished in Nlrp3- or Asc�/� mice,
yet fully intact in P2x7�/� animals (Figure 6E). Flow cytometric
analysis of the skin-draining lymph node in monobenzone-
sensitized mice revealed that Asc�/� animals did not display
any influx of immune cells with a macrophage-consistent pheno-
type upon monobenzone exposure, whereas wild-type animals
did (Figure S6).
Together, these results indicate that the installment of NK cell
memory in the context of monobenzone-induced CHS is fully
dependent on NLRP3 and its target cytokine IL-18. Moreover,
these experiments suggest that the recruitment of cells with a
macrophage-consistent phenotype into the skin-draining lymph
node represent an inflammasome-dependent event in the
course of monobenzone CHS installment.
Inflammasome Activation in Tissue Resident
Macrophages Drives NK Cell Memory
To further explore the involvement of the NLRP3 inflammasome
in the induction of NK cell memory, we conducted a series of
adoptive cell transfer experiments. First we thrived to elucidate
the role of inflammasome activation in either the priming or the
recall response. To this end, we adoptively transferred hepatic
NK cells from monobenzone-sensitized Asc�/� mice into wild-
type mice. Challenging the latter mice with monobenzone re-
vealed that ASC was required during the priming phase
(Figure 7A, middle panel). On the other hand, transferring NK
cells from wild-type mice into Asc�/� animals provided a similar
picture: Again, no monobenzone CHS response was observed
(Figure 7A, right panel). Having established that both priming,
as well as the recall response required inflammasome compe-
tence, we next wished to assess the requirement of the myeloid
compartment for the installment of CHS. To this end, we studied
bone marrow chimeric mice, in which wild-type or Nlrp3�/� bone
marrow was transplanted into wild-type or Nlrp3�/� mice in the
context of the monobenzone CHS protocol. As expected, wild-
type animals receiving wild-type bone marrow displayed CHS,
whereas Nlrp3�/� animals receiving Nlrp3�/� bone marrow
showed no signs of CHS. However, Nlrp3�/� animals obtaining
inflammasome-competent bone marrow displayed no signs of
CHS, whereas wild-type mice receiving Nlrp3�/� bone marrow
readily responded to monobenzone (Figure 7B). These results
indicated that NLRP3-competence was either required in non-
immune cells or in myeloid cells surviving the irradiation preced-
ing the bone marrow transfer. We considered the latter scenario
more likely, given the fact that NLRP3 expression is confined to
the myeloid lineage (Guarda et al., 2011). At the same time, it is
well established that skin-resident myeloid cells survive common
protocols of bone marrow transfer (Bogunovic et al., 2006;
Merad et al., 2002; Zaba et al., 2009). To address the possibility
of radio-resistant, myeloid cells being the culprit, we treated

 mice with carrageenan in the course of the bone marrow transfer
procedure. We expected that this treatment would deplete the
skin-resident macrophages and allow the repopulation of the
skin with bone-marrow-derived cells. Indeed, these experiments
revealed that Nlrp3�/� animals obtaining wild-type bone marrow
now displayed monobenzone triggered CHS (Figure 7C, middle
panel). On the contrary, wild-type animals receiving Nlrp3�/�
bone marrow and repetitively treated with carrageenan lost
their capacity to establish the monobenzone dependent CHS
response (Figure 7C, lower panel). In line with the assumption
that carrageenan treatment allowed the re-population of the
skin with bone-marrow-derived cells, flow cytometric analysis
of the skin showed that carrageenan did not alter the absolute
presence of CD64+ CD11c� or dim macrophages, nor did it influ-
ence the general engraftment of CD11b+ CD11c� myeloid cells
or CD11c+ CD11b� dendritic cells (Figure 7D). Rather, following
the bone marrow transfer procedure, it showed that carrageenan
specifically boosted the re-population of the skin with macro-
phages of the tissue-resident phenotype, to the expense of
macrophages of the inflammatory phenotype (Figure 7E and
Figure S7).
All in all, these results indicate that NLRP3 inflammasome
competence was required for both the induction as well as the
recall response within the tissue-resident macrophage popula-
tion to drive monobenzone-induced memory NK cell formation.
DISCUSSION
In previous studies, we have shown that monobenzone’s target-
ing of pigmented cells can be exploited to generate melanocyte
antigen-specific CD8+ T cells in vivo in mice when it is applied
daily and adjuvanted with TLR-ligands over a prolonged period
of time (van den Boorn et al., 2010) or in vitro in extended human
DC-T cell co-cultures (van den Boorn et al., 2011b). Nonetheless,
the incipient events embodying the intrinsic immunogenicity of
this melanocyte-specific hapten in vivo have remained unknown.
Studying monobenzone’s initiation of pigment-cell-specific im-
munity in the isolated setting of CHS, we made the surprising
observation that this contact sensitizer triggered a CHS
response that was fully dependent on NK cells. We observed
that this monobenzone-induced CHS response was specific,
long lasting and attributable to an NK cell population residing
in the liver. In fact, transfer of hepatic NK cells from monoben-
zone-treated mice conferred hapten-specific sensitivity upon
otherwise naive animals. Monobenzone-induced NK cells ex-
erted cytotoxic activity against pigmented cells, consistent
with the fact that monobenzone specifically haptenizes melano-
cytic antigens. Together, these findings indicate that monoben-
zone induced the formation of a so-called memory NK cell
population, directed against a melanocyte-specific (neo)antigen.
Subsequent studies showed that predominantly tissue-residing
macrophages migrated into the local draining lymph nodes
upon monobenzone skin exposure and that this coincided with
local NK cell activation. In line with this, macrophage depletion
with carrageenan abrogated the induction of monobenzone-
CHS. Interestingly, monobenzone-mediated memory NK cell
formation turned out to be fully dependent on the involvement
of the NLRP3 inflammasome and its target cytokine IL-18.
Moreover, skin repopulation with wild-type macrophages of a
tissue-resident phenotype could install monobenzone CHS in
Nlrp3�/� mice. Lymph node migration of macrophages from
monobenzone-treated
skin was absent in inflammasome-
deficient mice, indicating the possibility that inflammasome
activation is indeed required for the migration of activated mac-
rophages into the local lymph node, to provide the specific stim-
ulus to NK cells.
Studying the innate determinant of monobenzone-triggered
CHS, we found a non-redundant role for the NLRP3 - IL-18
axis in the formation of hapten-dependent NK cell memory. Pre-
vious studies have already suggested a role for the cytokines
IFN-a, IFN-g, and IL-12 for NK cell responses in T and B cell-defi-
cient hosts against the broad-acting sensitizer DNFB (Majew-
ska-Szczepanik et al., 2013), yet not in the context of a specific
PRR cascade. On the other hand, an involvement of the NLRP3
inflammasome has been shown in the course of trinitrofluoro-
benzene (TNFB) and oxazolone-driven CHS responses. How-
ever, in these settings, in which the CHS response is mediated
by T cells, NLRP3 activation required the presence of P2X7
(Weber et al., 2010). On the contrary, P2X7 was clearly dispens-
able for monobenzone CHS, thereby excluding a role for ATP as
a DAMP molecule in this model. We attribute this mechanistic
difference to the fact that monobenzone employs a highly cell-
type-specific and thus unique mode of action. While standard
contact sensitizers like oxazolone cause profound cellular stress
in all layers of the epidermis, thereby mediating strong cellular
release of ATP, monobenzone is a pro-hapten that is selectively
activated by tyrosinase within the melanosomes of pigmented
cells. Monobenzone-haptenation inhibits the tyrosinase enzyme,

 leading to accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) inside
the melanosome. The ensuing cellular stress induces profound
melanosome autophagy and release of autophagy-derived exo-
somes (van den Boorn et al., 2011b). To this effect, we hypothe-
size that monobenzone-induced exosomes contain DAMPs,
which subsequently engage the NLRP3 inflammasome in skin
tissue-resident macrophages that take up these exosomes.
During our investigations, we identified a dominant role for tis-
sue-residing macrophages in the induction and recall phase of
monobenzone CHS. Collectively, our results point to a scenario,
in which the tissue-residing macrophages are attracted to
monobenzone-exposed skin where they are activated in a
NLRP3 inflammasome-dependent manner. Subsequently they
travel to the draining lymph node to specifically activate NK cells
toward melanocyte-specific antigens. The latter can embody the
initial activation of naive memory NK cells or the re-activation of a
pre-existing memory NK cell population. Of note, both ‘‘inflam-
matory’’ and ‘‘resident’’ macrophages can proliferate and
home to local lymph nodes under inflammatory conditions (Da-
vies et al., 2013a, 2013b; Perdiguero and Geissmann, 2016).
The need for NLRP3 inflammasome competence specifically
within the skin tissue-residing macrophages is supported by
our
bone
marrow
transplantation
experiments
employing
carrageenan. As such, we observed that only bone marrow
transplanted into mice that had been pretreated with carra-
geenan displayed the phenotype of the bone marrow transplant.

 Carrageenan pre-treatment also resulted in a better engraftment
of the skin with transplant-derived macrophages of a tissue resi-
dent phenotype as opposed to macrophages of an inflammatory
phenotype. A crucial role for tissue-resident macrophages was
furthermore supported by the observation that monobenzone
induced the specific migration of tissue-resident macrophages
into the lymph node and the fact that carrageenan treatment re-
sulted in a preferential, transient depletion of these macro-
phages. Of note, while the carrageenan-mediated effects on
the repopulation of the skin by donor-derived myeloid cells
showed very consistent differences, they were not absolute.
Several reasons may account for the discrepancy between func-
tional data and the flow cytometric engraftment analysis. On the
one hand, it is likely that our flow cytometric analysis of the skin
might have been ‘‘diluted’’ with cells from the vasculature or the
deeper layers of the skin. At the same time a threshold effect
might exist, characterized by a lacking linear relationship be-
tween macrophage numbers and effect size. Alternatively, it is
possible that tissue resident macrophages of the CX3CR1hi
CD64+ CD11c� or dim F4/80+ CD11b+ phenotype might not repre-
sent the spot-on macrophage subtype critical to these effects; in
fact, they might represent a super-population of an even more
specific cell type. At the same time, it is also conceivable that
bone-marrow-derived cells require additional time to regain the
phenotype of tissue resident macrophages, which would under-
report their presence in our analysis. Analysis by additional
markers or mouse models like CD11c.DTR could reveal such
populations, whereas specific depletion by genetic means would
allow further dissection of the active roles the individual macro-
phage subtypes at play.
We observed that monobenzone-triggered memory NK cells
are pigment-cell-specific. They exert cytotoxic activity specif-
ically against pigmented cells in vivo and ex vivo and appear suf-
ficient to instigate vitiligo-like fur depigmentation in mice. Vitiligo
vulgaris is well known as a progressive autoimmune disease,
nonetheless the exact mechanisms underlying its initiation
remain obscure (Ezzedine et al., 2015; van den Boorn et al.,
2009). Interestingly, while classically perceived as a T cell
driven autoimmune disease, several of reports have already
implicated the involvement of NK cells in disease pathogenesis.
Indeed, vitiligo patients display a dramatic upregulation of
NK cell associated transcripts and NK cell numbers in skin le-
sions (Yu et al., 2012). While this could be seen as non-specific
bystander activation of innate cells, our results suggest that
NK cells might indeed play a causative role in the initiation
of vitiligo vulgaris. In this context, other factors next to monoben-
zone could stress melanocytes in such a way that they instigate a
specific memory NK cell response directed at destroying pig-
mented cells. This, in turn, could foster the induction of T cell-
dependent autoimmunity by liberation of melanocyte-specific
antigens.
Taken together, our data demonstrate that melanocyte-stress,
in the context of monobenzone treatment, induces a CHS
response that is purely driven by liver-resident memory NK cells
in an immunocompetent host. As such, it provides an excellent
tool to investigate memory NK cell responses under physiolog-
ical conditions, not being bound to a RAG-deficient background.
Interestingly, memory NK cell formation by monobenzone is
strictly dependent on the engagement of the NLRP3 inflamma-
some and the subsequent activation of its target cytokine IL-
18, and crucially involves the activities of skin tissue-resident
macrophages, exposing important facets of memory NK cell in-
duction. We hypothesize that inflammasome activation occurs in
these macrophages that sense a melanocyte-derived stress
signal and that these macrophages migrate to the local draining
lymph node, where they convey this response to local NK cells.
These findings provide insights into the mechanisms of memory
NK cell induction, with the NLRP3 inflammasome axis playing a
non-redundant role as an essential, innate verification signal that
is required to instigate the formation of NK cell memory. Finally,
in light of the fact that monobenzone-induced memory NK cells
display specific cytotoxic activities against both melanocytes
and melanoma cells, these data imply an important role for mem-
ory NK cell induction in the context of autoimmunity and cancer
immunotherapy.

 AOO was likewise applied on day 5. Ear swelling was measured using a highly
sensitive digital micrometer (Kroeplin-IP67, Kroeplin).
Flow Cytometry
Minced ear tissue or freshly isolated lymph nodes, were passed over a 70 mm
cell strainer in PBS-E and washed in PBA buffer (PBS +2% FCS and 0.05%
Sodium-Azide) to obtain a cell suspension. Antibodies and the basic staining
procedure are included in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures section.

Biosciences). Flow cytometric data was analyzed using Flowjo X.07 software
(Flowjo LLC).
Cell Culture and ELISA
B16.F10 and HCmel3 murine melanoma and MCA205 murine sarcoma
cells were cultured in complete RPMI-1640 medium at 37�C and 5% CO2.
For ex vivo NK cell stimulation, 4 3 104 hepatic NK cells were co-cultured
with 2 3 104 target cells (E:T ratio 2:1) in complete RPMI-1640 medium with
the addition of 100 ng/mL IL-15 and 100 IU/mL IL-2 (all Peprotech, Germany).
Following 16 hr co-culture, supernatants were analyzed for IFN-g production
by ELISA (BD Bioscience) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
In Vivo Assays
