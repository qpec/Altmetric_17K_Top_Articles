Summary
There has been increased interest in the prophylactic and therapeutic use of high-flow nasal oxygen in
patients with, or at risk of, non-hypercapnic respiratory failure. There are no randomised trials examining
the efficacy of high-flow nasal oxygen in high-risk cardiac surgical patients. We sought to determine
whether routine administration of high-flow nasal oxygen, compared with standard oxygen therapy, leads
to reduced hospital length of stay after cardiac surgery in patients with pre-existing respiratory disease at
high risk for postoperative pulmonary complications. Adult patients with pre-existing respiratory disease
undergoing elective cardiac surgery were randomly allocated to receive high-flow nasal oxygen (n = 51) or
standard oxygen therapy (n = 49). The primary outcome was hospital length of stay and all analyses were
carried out on an intention-to-treat basis. Median (IQR [range]) hospital length of stay was 7 (6–9 [4–30])
days in the high-flow nasal oxygen group and 9 (7–16 [4–120]) days in the standard oxygen group
(p=0.012). Geometric mean hospital length of stay was 29% lower in the high-flow nasal group (95%CI
11–44%, p = 0.004). High-flow nasal oxygen was also associated with fewer intensive care unit re-admis-
sions (1/49 vs. 7/45; p = 0.026). When compared with standard care, prophylactic postoperative high-flow
nasal oxygen reduced hospital length of stay and intensive care unit re-admission. This is the first
randomised controlled trial examining the effect of prophylactic high-flow nasal oxygen use on patient-
centred outcomes in cardiac surgical patients at high risk for postoperative respiratory complications.

 Introduction
Patients undergoing cardiac surgery are at significant risk
of postoperative pulmonary complications, and these
complications may increase morbidity and mortality and
lead to prolonged intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital
length of stay (LOS) [1]. The reported incidence of
postoperative pulmonary complications following cardiac
surgery
ranges
from
8%
to
79%
[2].
Postoperative
pulmonary complications manifest early as hypoxaemia,
later pneumonia, and in rare cases also as acute respiratory
distress syndrome [3]. The incidence of postoperative
pulmonary complications is increased in patients with
intrinsic respiratory disease, asthma, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD) and heavy smokers [4]. These
patients often stay longer in the ICU after surgery due to
lower respiratory tract infections, impaired ventilation and
the need for prolonged ventilatory support. They are also
more likely to require re-admission to ICU for unplanned
continuous positive airways pressure (CPAP), non-invasive
or invasive mechanical ventilation. Therefore, hospital stay
is prolonged compared with low-risk patients after cardiac
surgery [5–7]. A contributing mechanism of postoperative
pulmonary complications is atelectasis, which has been
shown to affect up to 90% of patients undergoing cardiac
surgery. Atelectasis has been shown to be resistant to
simple techniques such as patient positioning and incentive
spirometry [8]. Lung recruitment manoeuvres and positive
airways pressure may reduce atelectasis development, but
this effect is lost after tracheal extubation [9].
Prophylactic
nasal
CPAP
reduces
postoperative
pulmonary
complications
after
cardiac
surgery
[10].
However, CPAP is costly and requires more intensive
involvement by hospital staff. In many hospitals, its use
requires admission to at least a high dependency area or
even ICU, thus further increasing costs. Apart from the
expense and extra healthcare provision costs, common
potential side-effects from CPAP include mask discom-
fort, skin abrasions, inability to communicate effectively,
inability to eat or drink while the device is in use, inability
to mobilise and irritation from device noise [11, 12].
High-flow nasal oxygen therapy delivers warmed
humidified oxygen and low level, flow-dependent posi-
tive airways pressure, and may be better tolerated than
CPAP or non-invasive ventilation; moreover, high-flow
nasal oxygen enhances washout of nasopharyngeal dead
space, thus improving oxygenation [13–16]. It has been
shown that high-flow nasal oxygen is both safe and non-
inferior to conventional CPAP in providing prophylactic
support to very preterm neonates after extubation while
the incidence of nasal trauma was significantly lower than
in the CPAP group [17]. No study has assessed the effect
of prophylactic use of high-flow nasal oxygen on hospital
stay in adult cardiac surgical patients with significant risk
factors for postoperative pulmonary complications. We
therefore, decided to study high-risk patients with pre-
existing lung disease (COPD, asthma, recent lower respi-
ratory tract infection), heavy smokers or morbidly obese
patients (body mass index (BMI) ≥ 35 kg.m�2), who were
expected to stay longer in ICU and hospital due to
increased
respiratory
complications.
We
tested
the
hypothesis that routine administration of high-flow nasal
oxygen leads to reduced hospital length of stay after
cardiac surgery compared with standard oxygen therapy.
Methods
Following national research ethics service (East Midlands
Research Ethics Committee UK) and local Research and
Development approval, written informed consent was
obtained from all patients. Patients scheduled for elective
cardiac surgery (coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG),
valve surgery or both) were screened for eligibility.
Patients were included in the trial if they were aged
> 18 years,
had
one
or
more
patient-related
risk
factors
for
postoperative
pulmonary
complications
(COPD,
asthma,
lower
respiratory
tract
infection
in
preceding four weeks, BMI ≥ 35 kg.m�2, current (within
last six weeks) heavy smokers (> 10 pack years)) and
were
capable
of
performing
a
6-minute
walk
test
(6MWT). Only patients with a formal COPD or asthma
diagnosis (as defined by British Thoracic Society and
National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) on
inhaled therapy were enrolled [18, 19]. Lower respiratory
tract infection was defined according to National Institute
for Health and Care Excellence as an acute illness, usually
with cough as the main symptom, and with at least one
other lower respiratory tract symptom (such as fever,
sputum
production,
breathlessness,
wheeze
or
chest
discomfort/pain)
and
no
alternative
explanation
[20].
According
to
the
trial
protocol,
patients
in
whom
high-flow nasal oxygen was contraindicated (presence of
a
nasal
septal
defect),
those
who
needed
CPAP
pre-operatively or those who did not meet tracheal
extubation criteria by 10.00 the day after surgery (as they
did
not
follow
the
local
protocolised
peri-operative
care pathway), were not studied. Randomisation was
performed
using
a
computer-generated
assignment
sequence and a centralised online system before the
induction of anaesthesia while the patients were in the
operating theatre. Participating patients were randomly
allocated in a 1:1 ratio (block randomisation procedure

 with randomly selected block sizes keeping the investiga-
tors blinded to the size of each block) to either the high-
flow nasal oxygen or standard oxygen therapy group.
A research nurse or clinical investigator not involved in
the clinical care of the patient obtained the treatment
allocation and informed the ICU nursing staff in order
that
the
allocated
therapy
was
prepared.
We were,
therefore, unable to blind patients or nursing staff in the
ICU. Surgical and nursing teams responsible for deciding
when patients were discharged (and therefore hospital
stay) and other aspects of their postoperative care on the
surgical ward were blinded as to group allocation.
Study participants underwent a 6MWT before the
operation, conducted in a standard manner according to
the guidelines of the American Thoracic Society [21].
Additionally, patients underwent pre-operative spirometry
testing. This was repeated three times, and average
values for forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1)
and forced vital capacity (FVC), were calculated.
The anaesthetic technique and surgical procedure
were
not
affected
by
patients’
participation
in
this
study. Anaesthesia was induced with midazolam, fentanyl
and
propofol,
neuromuscular
blockade
achieved
with
pancuronium and anaesthesia maintained with a continuous
infusion of propofol and/or inhalational anaesthetic agent
at the discretion of the attending anaesthetist. All patients’
lungs were ventilated using volume control ventilation
and
the
same
intra-operative
ventilatory
settings,
in
accordance with local practice: tidal volume 6–8 ml.kg�1
predicted body weight; positive end-expiratory pressure
(PEEP) level of 5 cmH2O; cessation of mechanical ventilation
and zero PEEP during cardiopulmonary bypass.
At the end of surgery, patients were transferred to the
ICU where they received standard post-cardiac surgery
monitoring and treatment. Patients’ tracheas were extu-
bated once they were normothermic and not bleeding,
had established a regular respiratory pattern, had no signif-
icant residual neuromuscular blockade and did not com-
plain of anything other than mild pain. Postoperative pain
relief was provided by regular paracetamol and opioid
analgesia for all patients, unless they had a specific con-
traindication (e.g. known drug allergy).
Following tracheal extubation, patients received either
high-flow nasal oxygen or standard oxygen therapy, that
is, low-flow oxygen via nasal prongs or a soft facemask,
according to the randomisation performed before surgery.
The high-flow nasal oxygen was set up and connected to
the patients by the ICU nurses who had been trained
before the start of the study. The fraction of inspired oxy-
gen (FIO2) delivered was titrated to that which resulted in
a pulse oximeter saturation of at least 95% (93% for those
at risk of hypercapnic respiratory failure, such as con-
firmed
COPD
patients
and
morbidly
obese
patients)
according to the British Thoracic Society guidelines for oxy-
gen use in adult patients [22]. The FIO2 was actively
reduced to the minimum level which achieved this goal.
Gas flow for the high-flow nasal oxygen was calculated
for each patient, based on their body characteristics and
comfort
level.
The
standard
starting
flow
rate
was
30 l.min�1, and this was adjusted up or down between a
range of 20–50 l.min�1 with the aim of achieving a respi-
ratory rate of less than 16 breaths per minute and patient
comfort. Patients randomised to receive standard oxygen
therapy were fitted with nasal prongs or a soft facemask
and the oxygen flow titrated to provide oximetry satura-
tions of at least 95% (93% for those at risk of hypercapnic
respiratory failure, such as confirmed COPD patients and
morbidly obese patients). Both groups of patients had
oxygen therapy prescribed for the first 24 h postopera-
tively and were transferred to surgical wards once they
fulfilled pre-specified physiological criteria. Oxygen ther-
apy was discontinued after 24 h unless there was evi-
dence of respiratory deterioration (dyspnoea, oxygen
saturation < 95% (or < 93% for COPD and morbidly
obese patients), respiratory rate > 20 breaths per minute).
Patients randomly allocated to receive high-flow nasal
oxygen could have high-flow nasal oxygen continued for
more than 24 h (in the ICU or surgical ward) if it was
deemed necessary. Patients who continued to be in
respiratory distress (respiratory rate > 20 breaths per
minute, oxygen saturation < 95% (or < 93% for COPD
and morbidly obese patients)) were treated initially by
increasing the FIO2. Failing these measures, CPAP, non-
invasive ventilation or, if necessary, invasive mechanical
ventilation were considered, as is standard practice at
our institution. Participation in the study did not preclude
any measures which the clinical team caring for the
patient felt were necessary. As part of their standard
care, all patients were instructed on appropriate respira-
tory exercises postoperatively. On postoperative day 5
or 6, patients had both the 6MWT and spirometry test-
ing repeated. Removal of chest drains was decided
upon by the surgical team, who also decided when
patients would be discharged from the hospital. The
surgical team and the physiotherapists were unaware of
the study group allocations unless oxygen therapy was
continued after discharge from ICU.
The primary outcome of the study was hospital stay.
Pre-specified secondary outcomes were: ICU stay; ICU re-
admission
rate;
in-hospital
mortality
rate;

(pre- and postoperatively) and postoperative quality of
recovery assessed using the postoperative quality of
recovery scale (PQRS) questionnaire [23]. The PQRS was
completed on the day of admission (baseline) and before
discharge
(approximately
1 week
after
surgery),
and
again 1 month following surgery by telephone contact.
The PQRS data were reported as the proportion of
patients recovered at each time-point (baseline, first post-
operative week, first postoperative month). We focused on
non-physiological
recovery
domains
(nociceptive,
cognitive, activities of daily living (ADL), emotive) and over-
all patient satisfaction. The PQRS questionnaires were con-
ducted face-to-face during hospital stay, and by telephone
after hospital discharge. Detailed information around how
to use the test and how different domains are being
assessed is provided on the PQRS website (http://www.pos
topqrs.
com/).
When planning our study, we analysed our hospital
database for more than 2000 cardiac surgical procedures
carried out in the year 2014, and found that mean (SD)
hospital stay was 10 (3) days in patients with the same
risk factors. We expected high-flow nasal oxygen to
reduce mean length of stay by 2 days (a 20% relative
reduction) to 8 days; data from our trial in thoracic
surgery patients showed a 35% reduction in length of
stay, so we proposed that 20% was both feasible and
clinically
significant.
Sample
size
calculation
demon-
strated that 92 patients (46 per group) would provide
90% power to detect a mean difference of 2 days in
hospital length of stay. The required sample size was
increased to 100 patients (50 per group) to allow for a
5% loss to follow-up and drop-outs. Baseline data were
described using frequencies and percentages for catego-
rical variables and either mean and SD or median, IQR
and range for continuous variables. Total hospital stay
was calculated for all patients who were discharged alive.
As total hopsital length of stay was positively skewed,
comparisons
between
groups
were
made
using
the
Wilcoxon Rank Sum test and the ratio of geometric
means. A risk ratio (RR) was used to compare prolonged
stay (defined as total hospital stay > 10 days) in the two
groups. Intensive care re-admission and death were
compared using Fisher’s exact test, and 6MWT and
pulmonary function tests were compared using linear
regression.
Recovery
profiles
were
compared
using
Chi-squared tests and multi-level mixed-effect logistic
regression. All analyses were by intention-to-treat and
were performed using Stata version 15.1 (StataCorp.

was considered statistically significant.
Results
One
hundred
patients
were
enrolled
in
the
study,
51 patients were allocated to receive high-flow nasal
oxygen and 49 to receive standard oxygen therapy. Of
these, six patients were not included in the final analysis
due to protocol violation (two patients in each group
were not extubated by 10:00 on the morning after
surgery), surgery being cancelled (one patient in the
standard
oxygen
group)
and
withdrawal
of
consent
(one patient in the standard oxygen group) (Fig. 1).
All other randomly allocated patients were included in
the
intention-to-treat
analysis.

Median (IQR [range]) hospital
length of stay was 7 (6–9
[4–30]) and 9 (7–16 [4–120]) days in the high-flow nasal
oxygen
group
and
the
standard
oxygen
group,
respectively, p = 0.012. The geometric mean hospital
length of stay was 29% lower in the high-flow nasal
oxygen group (95%CI: 11–44%), p = 0.004. A sensitivity
analysis removing the single outlying value (120 days)
from the standard oxygen group did not materially alter
the conclusions (Figure 2). The risk of prolonged stay
was
18.7%
in
the
high-flow
nasal
oxygen
group
compared with 38.6% in the standard oxygen group
(RR 0.49, 95%CI: 0.24–0.97), p = 0.0343. There was no
difference in ICU length of stay (p = 0.949) with the med-
ian (IQR [range])
being
1
(1–2
[1–15])
and 1 (1–2
[1–23]) in the high-flow nasal oxygen group and standard
oxygen group, respectively. Patients in the high-flow
nasal oxygen group had fewer ICU re-admissions (1/49
vs. 7/45; p = 0.026). There was one death in each group.
Less than half of the patients enrolled performed a
postoperative 6MWT. The mean (SD) distance was 207.3
(98.9) m in the high-flow nasal oxygen group compared
with 186.1 (114.9) m in the standard oxygen group;
mean difference was 21.3 m (95%CI: �44.0 to 86.6),
p = 0.510. Postoperative pulmonary function tests were
performed in two-thirds of the patients. There was no
significant difference between the two groups in terms
of FEV1 and FVC. The number of patients requiring
escalation
of
respiratory
support
(unplanned
CPAP,
non-invasive or invasive ventilation) was three (6.1%) in
the high-flow nasal oxygen group compared with six
(13.3%) in the standard oxygen group (p = 0.190). One

 pulmonary complications to receive either high-flow nasal
oxygen or standard oxygen therapy following tracheal
extubation. This is the first randomised controlled trial
examining the effect of prophylactic use of high-flow
nasal oxygen on clinical outcomes in cardiac surgical
patients with significant risk factors for peri-operative
pulmonary complications. We demonstrated that high-
flow nasal oxygen use resulted in a statistically signifi-
cant reduction in hospital length of stay and fewer
re-admissions
to
ICU.
There
were
no
significant
between-group differences in other secondary outcomes.
Airflow limitation strongly predicts increased hospital
stay and in-hospital mortality after cardiac surgery [24].
The beneficial effect of high-flow nasal oxygen after
cardiac surgery and reduction in hospital stay in our
study cohort could potentially be explained by the fol-
lowing mechanisms: washout of nasopharyngeal dead
space; reduced work of breathing; improved respiratory
mechanics; and generation of low-level PEEP [25–27].
The warmed and humidified oxygen facilitates optimum
function of the airway mucosa and mucociliary clearance,
and inhibits bronchomotor response, thus preventing
bronchospasm
and
increases
in
airway
resistance
[28,
29].

 rebreathing,
more
effective
alveolar
ventilation
and
decreased work of breathing [26]. Furthermore, high-flow
nasal oxygen provides PEEP of 3–5 cmH2O at flows
of
30–50 l.min�1
which
could
potentially
reduce
postoperative atelectasis [15]. Prevention of postoperative
hypoxaemia and hypercapnia, together with improved
pulmonary
mechanics,
not
only
reduces
pulmonary
morbidity but may also improve cardiac function by
reducing myocardial oxygen demand and the adverse
effects of impaired gas exchange on pulmonary vasculature.
These mechanisms could explain the beneficial effect of
prophylactic high-flow nasal oxygen use in the immediate
postoperative period. We would, therefore, expect an
improvement in postoperative pulmonary function and
6MWT which we were unable to demonstrate. A possible
explanation for these results could be that the study was
not powered to compare those secondary outcomes, or
that patients had limited physiological reserve due to
chronic lung disease (COPD, asthma), recent sternotomy
and major surgery.
In the non-cardiac surgery setting, high-flow nasal
oxygen is increasingly being used as a first-line therapy in
acute respiratory failure. This strategy is supported by
data from well-designed and adequately powered trials
showing that high-flow nasal oxygen application reduces
tracheal re-intubation rate in low-risk patients [30] when
compared with conventional oxygen therapy, confers
survival benefit [31] and results in a lower tracheal
re-intubation rate [32] in patients with, or at risk of,
non-hypercapnic
hypoxaemic

Zochios et al. | High-flow nasal oxygen in high-risk cardiac surgical patients
 trials (n = 1972) examining the safety and efficacy of
high-flow nasal oxygen in general ICU patients requiring
respiratory
support
found
insufficient
evidence
to
determine superiority of high-flow nasal oxygen in the
ICU setting [33]. In a pragmatic randomised controlled
trial,
Parke
et al.
demonstrated
that
high-flow
nasal
oxygen did not improve outcomes as assessed by oxy-
gen saturation to fraction of inspired oxygen (SpO2/FIO2)
ratio
after
cardiac
surgery,
but
did
reduce
the
requirement for escalation of respiratory support [34]. In
a
recent
randomised
controlled
trial,
Corley
et al.
compared prophylactic tracheal extubation followed by
high-flow
nasal
oxygen
for
8 h
with
standard
care
post-cardiac surgery in obese patients (BMI ≥ 30 kg.m�2)
[35]. Primary outcome was atelectasis on postoperative
chest
radiograph.
Prophylactic
tracheal
extubation
followed by high-flow nasal oxygen did not lead to
improvements in respiratory function or a statistically
significant difference in ICU stay. The limited high-flow
nasal oxygen exposure time (8 h) in the Corley trial and
use of surrogate (SpO2/FIO2 ratio and atelectasis score)
markers, rather than patient-oriented primary outcomes
(which would have required a much larger sample size),
were the main limitations of these studies. Furthermore,
reporting ‘non-validated’ surrogate primary outcomes is
more likely to result in overestimation of treatment effect
and uncertainty in predicting treatment benefit [36].
We selected hospital stay as the primary outcome
because it is more relevant to patients and healthcare
providers
than
physiological
parameters
such
as
oxygenation
or
haemodynamic
data.
Length
of
stay
integrates postoperative pulmonary and extra-pulmonary
complications, and speed of postoperative recovery. It is,
therefore,
a
non-mortality
patient-centred
outcome
which reflects quality and value-based healthcare delivery
[37, 38].
A
recent
meta-analysis
which
included
the
aforementioned two randomised trials only, examined
the efficacy and safety of high-flow nasal oxygen after
cardiac
surgery
compared
with
conventional
oxygen
therapy and found that post-extubation application of
high-flow nasal oxygen was associated with a significant
reduction in escalation of respiratory support (RR, 0.61;
95%CI, 0.46–0.82; z = 3.32, p < 0.001) [39]. However,
due
to
the
small
number
of
studies
analysed,
the
methods
utilised
to
detect
publication
bias
were
underpowered. In addition, the definitions, strategies and
criteria for escalation of respiratory support in the studies
included in the meta-analysis were non-specific, making
the validity of the results questionable. The differences in
escalation
of
respiratory
support
(unplanned
CPAP,
non-invasive
or
invasive
ventilation)
between
the
high-flow nasal oxygen group and the standard oxygen
group in our study cohort were non-significant.
In
a
large
(n = 830)
‘non-inferiority’
multi-centre
randomised trial, high-flow nasal oxygen was compared
with BiPAP in patients with, or at risk of, respiratory fail-
ure after cardiothoracic surgery [40]. The primary out-
come in this study was treatment failure, which was
defined as a composite of tracheal re-intubation, switch

 to the other study therapy or early discontinuation of the
assigned therapy, and the authors concluded that high-
flow nasal oxygen was not inferior to BiPAP. The control
group in this study does not necessarily represent the
standard of care or best practice because there are no
robust data indicating that BiPAP improves outcomes in
the cardiac surgery setting. In addition, by using a com-
posite primary outcome, the effect may be small for
important individual components (e.g. tracheal re-intuba-
tion rate) and large for less important clinical components
(e.g. crossover to another treatment group), limiting the
generalisability of the results [41]. A recent post-hoc anal-
ysis in the subset of obese (BMI > 30 kg.m�2) patients
from the same randomised controlled trial showed that
continuous application of high-flow nasal oxygen com-
pared with intermittent BiPAP in patients with or without
respiratory failure did not lead to a higher rate of treat-
ment failure [42]. The use of BiPAP was associated with
improved oxygenation indices; however this did not
translate into improved clinical outcomes.
None
of
the
high-flow
nasal
oxygen
studies
previously undertaken in the cardiac surgery setting were
powered to detect differences in clinically important
primary outcomes such as mortality or length of stay. No
study exclusively investigated the effect of high-flow nasal
oxygen on outcomes in patients at significantly higher
risk of postoperative pulmonary dysfunction, such as
patients with pre-existing pulmonary disease. Two studies
focused on obese patients who are at higher risk of
postoperative pulmonary complications, but methodological
flaws relating to their ‘non-inferiority’ design and post-hoc
analysis diminish the validity of their results [40, 42].
Our trial has several limitations. Firstly, there is poten-
tial bias due to a lack of blinding of the patients and
healthcare providers in the immediate postoperative per-
iod due to the obvious differences between the study
interventions. Secondly, our study was underpowered for
some of the secondary outcomes, for example, 6MWT
and patient-reported outcomes, and the composite of
postoperative
complications.
Although
we
did
not
discern significant between-group differences in patient-
reported
outcomes,
we
highlight
the
importance
of
reporting recovery profiles as they reflect value-based
care and provide potentially useful information in order
to adequately power future studies. Thirdly, the single
centre status of our study and potentially associated large
intervention effect may not be directly transferable to
other settings [43].
In conclusion, when compared with standard care,
prophylactic
postoperative
use
of
high-flow
nasal
oxygen
in cardiac surgical patients
at high risk for
postoperative respiratory complications reduced hospital
length
of
stay
and
re-admissions
to
ICU.
This
has
implications
for
reduced
healthcare
costs
and
potentially morbidity. We recommend routine use of
high-flow nasal oxygen after tracheal extubation in this
cohort of patients and further testing of our hypothesis
in large multi-centre randomised trials.
