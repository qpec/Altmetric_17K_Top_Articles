Background: The Antibiotic Resistance Monitoring in Ocular micRoorganisms study is an 
ongoing surveillance study that tracks antibiotic resistance among bacterial isolates from ocular 
infections across the United States. We report antibiotic resistance rates and trends from 2009 
through 2016.
Materials and methods: Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS), 
Streptococcus pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Haemophilus influenzae from vari-
ous ocular infections were obtained from participating United States centers. Isolates were sent 
to a central laboratory for determination of antibiotic resistance profiles. Minimum inhibitory 
concentrations were determined by broth microdilution according to the Clinical and Laboratory 
Standards Institute for drugs from more than ten antibiotic classes, and isolates were classified 
as susceptible or resistant based on systemic breakpoints, wherever available. Resistance rates 
were also evaluated based on decade of patient life and longitudinally over the 8-year time period.
Results: A total of 1,695 S. aureus, 1,475 CoNS, 474 S. pneumoniae, 586 H. influenzae, and 
599 P. aeruginosa were collected from 87 sites. Resistance was high among staphylococci and 
pneumococci, with methicillin resistance detected in 621 (36.6%) S. aureus and 717 (48.6%) 
CoNS isolates. Multidrug resistance (≥3 drug classes) was observed among staphylococci, 
particularly in methicillin-resistant (MR) isolates (MR S. aureus [MRSA]: 76.2%; MR CoNS 
[MRCoNS]: 73.5%). Differences in methicillin resistance among staphylococci were observed 
based on patient age, with higher rates observed in older patients (P<0.0001). For certain 
organism-antibiotic combinations, there were significant changes in resistance over time, includ-
ing a decrease in methicillin resistance among S. aureus (but not CoNS); no notable trends were 
observed for S. pneumoniae.
Conclusion: Antibiotic resistance was prevalent among gram-positive organisms, and MR 
staphylococcal isolates were more likely to be multidrug resistant. Although a small decrease in 
methicillin resistance was observed among S. aureus over time, the continued high prevalence of 
in vitro methicillin resistance should be considered when treating patients with ocular infections.

Introduction
Bacterial resistance to antibiotics, acquired primarily through genetic mutations, is 
high globally, with several contributing factors identified.1 Studies have shown that 
practices such as overprescription of antibiotics, use of inappropriate dosing regimens, 
and widespread agricultural use of antibiotics have contributed significantly to the 
problem of antibiotic resistance, with resistant bacteria posing considerable risk to

the  
resolution of systemic infections.2 Antibiotic resistance 
has also been observed among pathogens causing ocular 
infections specifically, with factors such as empirical pre-
scribing of antibiotics, short-term exposure to antibiotics, 
and repeated exposure to the same antibiotic identified as 
contributing to resistance of ocular pathogens, as well as 
leading to changes in resident ocular flora.3–7 Antimicrobial 
prophylaxis, used for the prevention of endophthalmitis 
and postoperative infection in patients undergoing ocular 
surgery,8,9 could also contribute to increased resistance rates 
among ocular pathogens.
Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylo-
cocci (CoNS; most frequently Staphylococcus epidermidis), 
which colonize the surfaces of the eyes and eyelids, are 
important contributors to ocular infections.10,11 While S. 
aureus accounts for a large proportion of bacterial keratitis 
cases (>25%),11,12 CoNS accounts for the majority (>30%) 
of endophthalmitis cases,11,13–15 especially acute episodes that 
develop after cataract surgery,16,17 and both are increasingly 
recognized as common causes of conjunctivitis when pres-
ent above established quantitative levels.18,19 Similarly, both 
Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae are 
commonly isolated from patients with bacterial conjunctivi-
tis, especially children,10,20 and the significant ocular pathogen 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a leading cause of bacterial 
keratitis in contact lens wearers.21
Ocular infections caused by these common bacterial patho-
gens are treated with a wide variety of antibiotics. Infection 
with resistant organisms can complicate antibiotic selection, 
increasing the risk of treatment failure with potentially sight-
threatening consequences.6 Since many antibiotics are also pre-
scribed systemically to treat a broad spectrum of other bacterial 
infections, cross-resistance can complicate treatment further.22 
Currently, besifloxacin, a chlorofluoroquinolone indicated for 
the treatment of bacterial conjunctivitis, is the only antibiotic 
exclusively formulated for topical ophthalmic use.23 Since its 
administration is solely topical, resistance to besifloxacin has 
the potential to be lower than that observed for other fluoroqui-
nolones, which are also administered systemically.24
The WHO Global Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resis-
tance emphasizes the importance of antibiotic resistance 
surveillance programs and research to strengthen the existing 
knowledge base and combat growing antimicrobial resis-
tance.25 Few multicenter studies have surveyed rates of anti-
biotic resistance specifically in ocular pathogens, with only 
the Ocular Tracking Resistance in the US Today (TRUST) 
and Antibiotic Resistance Monitoring in Ocular micRo-
organisms (ARMOR) surveillance programs  
publishing 
nationwide results in the recent past.26–29 The ARMOR study, 
which was initiated in 2009, is currently the only ongoing 
national surveillance study specifically designed to track in 
vitro antibacterial resistance rates among ocular pathogens. 
With collection of isolates over an 8-year period, the dataset 
is sufficiently large to allow for subanalyses to determine 
how factors like age impact resistance rates, as well as how 
resistance rates may change over time. An understanding 
of resistance patterns among ocular pathogens can help 
clinicians select appropriate treatment strategies, improve 
pre- and postoperative managements, and positively impact 
patient outcomes. Periodic updates of the ARMOR surveil-
lance study have been published previously.27,28 Here, we 
report cumulative resistance profiles and trends from 2009 
through 2016.
Materials and methods
study design and sample collection
The ARMOR study methodology has been described in 
detail previously.29 Briefly, clinically relevant isolates of 
S. aureus, CoNS, S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and P
. aeru-
ginosa cultured from ocular infections were submitted by US 
sites as part of the ongoing ARMOR study. Isolates of the 
requested species had to meet the clinical site’s criteria for 
“significant pathogen” and be collected from ocular tissue 
sources (ie, eye, conjunctiva, cornea, aqueous humor, and 
vitreous humor). From 2009 to 2013, each participating site 
was invited to submit up to 65 ocular isolates per collec-
tion year, including no more than 20 S. aureus, 20 CoNS, 
5 S. pneumoniae, 5 H. influenzae, and 15 P
. aeruginosa; 
whereas from 2014 to 2016, sites were invited to submit a 
maximum of 50 isolates per collection year of S. aureus, 
CoNS, S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and P
. aeruginosa, with 
no more than 12 isolates of any given species. The central 
laboratory in ARMOR obtained pure subcultures of bacte-
rial isolates from each of the clinical sites, although not all 
sites submitted samples throughout all 8 years. Enrolled sites 
included community hospitals, academic/university hospitals, 
specialty/ocular centers, and reference laboratories. Duplicate 
isolates from the same patient (same genus and species) were 
excluded from the study. Ocular pathogens collected from 
January 1, 2009 through December 31, 2016 were analyzed 
herein. As this was a laboratory study, informed consent and 
institutional review board approval were not required; Health 
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act compliance 
did not apply given the initial ocular samples were taken as 
part of routine medical care unrelated to this study, and no 
patient-identifying information was provided.

susceptibility to antibiotics and testing 
procedures
Bacterial isolates collected were sent to a central laboratory 
(Eurofins Medinet, Chantilly, VA, USA [2009–2013]; IHMA, 
Inc., Schaumburg, IL, USA [2014–2016]) for species con-
firmation and tested by the broth microdilution method in 
accordance with Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute 
(CLSI) procedures.30 Briefly, isolates (~5×105 CFU/mL) were 
grown in 96-well microtiter panels in the presence of titrated 
antibiotic concentrations and incubated for 16–20 hours 
(staphylococci and P
. aeruginosa, both in cation-adjusted 
Mueller-Hinton broth [CAMHB]) or 20–24 hours (S. pneu-
moniae in CAMHB supplemented with 3% lysed horse blood, 
and H. influenzae in Haemophilus test medium) in ambient 
air at 35°C. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), 
defined as the lowest concentration of an antimicrobial 
agent that prevents visible growth of a microorganism, was 
determined for each isolate by comparing growth in control 
wells (no antibiotic) to growth in wells that contained vary-
ing antibiotic concentrations.30 Lower MICs are indicative 
of higher in vitro antibiotic potency. Susceptibility testing 
was conducted using frozen microtiter panels containing 
various antibiotics from ten classes, namely, fluoroquino-
lones (moxifloxacin, gatifloxacin, levofloxacin, ofloxacin, 
ciprofloxacin, and besifloxacin), a macrolide (azithromycin), 
an aminoglycoside (tobramycin), a lincosamide (clindamy-
cin), penicillins (oxacillin/penicillin), a folate pathway 
inhibitor (trimethoprim), a polypeptide (polymyxin B), a 
phenicol (chloramphenicol), a glycopeptide (vancomycin), 
and a tetracycline (tetracycline); not all drugs were tested 
in all years of the ARMOR study. Isolates were classified 
as resistant (included both intermediate and full resistance) 
or susceptible to an antibiotic using systemic breakpoints 
defined by the CLSI, wherever available, to interpret MICs.31 
For staphylococcal isolates, susceptibility to oxacillin was 
used to categorize isolates as methicillin-resistant (MR) or 
methicillin-susceptible (MS). Susceptibility and resistance 
of S. pneumoniae isolates to penicillin were determined 
using the breakpoint for oral penicillin. Isolates resistant to 
≥3 classes of drugs were categorized as multidrug resistant.
statistical analyses
A one-way ANOVA was used to evaluate antibiotic resistance 
by patient’s age categorized by decade of life. Since not all 
antibiotic classes were tested in each of the 8 years of the 
study period, the ANOVA used the means of the percentages 
of drug classes to which each isolate of a species or species 
group was resistant. Tukey’s honestly significant difference 
(HSD) test for pairwise differences (comparison between 
all possible pairs of means obtained for every patient-age 
decade) used the P<0.05 criterion for statistical significance 
unless otherwise indicated, and was performed when ANO-
VAs showed significance at the P<0.05 level.32 Differences 
in methicillin resistance among staphylococcal isolates, 
specifically by decade of life, were assessed using a chi-
squared test. Longitudinal trends in antibiotic resistance over 
the study period were analyzed using the Cochran-Armitage 
test for linear trends in a proportion.33,34 Statistical testing 
was performed using Statistix 10 (Analytical Software, Tal-
lahassee, FL, USA).
Results
source of isolates
From January 1, 2009 through December 31, 2016, a total 
of 4,829 isolates (1,695 S. aureus, 1,475 CoNS, 474 S. 
pneumoniae, 586 H. influenzae, and 599 P. aeruginosa) 
were collected from 87 sites (46 community hospitals, 29 
academic/university hospitals, nine specialty/ocular centers, 
and three reference laboratories) across 40 states. Of these, 
2,124 (44.0%) and 2,261 (46.8%) isolates were obtained from 
male and female patients, respectively; patient’s gender was 
unknown for 444 (9.2%) isolates. A total of 3,934 (81.5%) 
isolates were obtained from patients with specified ages (<10 
years: 868 [22.1%]; 10–19 years: 173 [4.4%]; 20–29 years: 
249 [6.3%]; 30–39 years: 256 [6.5%]; 40–49 years: 345 
[8.8%]; 50–59 years: 457 [11.6%]; 60–69 years: 443 [11.3%]; 
70–79 years: 450 [11.4%]; 80–89 years: 463 [11.8%]; and 
90–99 years: 230 [5.8%]). The precise anatomical infection 
source was known for 2,427 isolates (50.3%) of which 1,198 
(49.4%) were obtained from the conjunctiva, 1,022 (42.1%) 
from the cornea, 69 (2.8%) from the aqueous humor, and 
138 (5.7%) from the vitreous humor.
Cumulative antibiotic resistance rates
Tables 1–3 present in vitro antibiotic resistance profiles for 
the cumulative dataset by species/species group, including 
those for S. aureus and CoNS by methicillin resistance 
phenotype.
Of the S. aureus collected (Table 1), 60.6%, 35.8%, and 
36.6% demonstrated in vitro resistance to azithromycin, cip-
rofloxacin, and methicillin (MR S. aureus [MRSA]), respec-
tively. While some resistance to tobramycin (17.4%) and 
clindamycin (15.4%) was noted, few S. aureus isolates were 
resistant to chloramphenicol (6.1%), trimethoprim (4.4%), 
and tetracycline (4.3%), and all were susceptible to vanco-
mycin. Compared to MS S. aureus (MSSA) isolates, which

The majority of CoNS isolates collected were S. epi-
dermidis (1,119 [75.9%]). As shown in Table 2, cumulative 
in vitro resistance among CoNS isolates was greatest to 
azithromycin (61.2%), methicillin (MR CoNS [MRCoNS]: 
48.6%), and ciprofloxacin (34.9%), followed by trimethoprim 
(28.0%) and clindamycin (26.1%). Resistance to tobramycin 
and tetracycline was 17.0% and 13.9%, respectively, while 
chloramphenicol resistance was low (1.2%). Similar to 
MRSA isolates, higher rates of resistance were found among 
MRCoNS isolates when compared to MS CoNS (MSCoNS). 
As observed with S. aureus, MIC90s were lower with newer 
fluoroquinolones as compared to older fluoroquinolones, 
and besifloxacin exhibited the lowest MIC90s (all CoNS: 2 
µg/mL; MSCoNS: 0.25 µg/mL; and MRCoNS: 4 µg/mL). 
Vancomycin MIC90s were also consistently low among CoNS 
(2 µg/mL for all, MRCoNS, and MSCoNS).
Although high levels of in vitro resistance to azithro-
mycin (35.9%) and penicillin (33.3%) were noted among S. 
pneumoniae isolates (Table 3), fluoroquinolone resistance 
was low (<1%). Among S. pneumoniae isolates, besifloxacin 
had the lowest MIC90 of all tested antibiotics (0.06 µg/mL).
Isolates of P
. aeruginosa were found to be generally sus-
ceptible to all antibiotics tested (Table 3), with low in vitro 
resistance to polymyxin B (8.6%), tobramycin (2.5%), and 
the fluoroquinolones (5.2%–7.4%). MIC90 was the lowest for 
ciprofloxacin (0.5 µg/mL).
Similarly, H. influenzae isolates collected were nearly all 
susceptible to the antibiotics tested (Table 3), with only 2.5% 
and <1% in vitro resistance observed for tetracycline and the 
fluoroquinolones, respectively. The MIC90s for tested antibiot-
ics were no greater than 0.03 µg/mL for the fluoroquinolones,

Multidrug resistance among staphylococci
Since methicillin resistance is often an indication of concur-
rent resistance to other antibiotic classes, we summarized the 
percentage of multidrug resistance among staphylococcal 
isolates (Figure 1). Overall, in vitro multidrug resistance was 
observed in 542 (32.0%) S. aureus isolates and 601 (40.7%) 
CoNS isolates. Rates of multidrug resistance were much 
higher among MR staphylococci than MS isolates, with 473 
(76.2%) MRSA isolates and 527 (73.5%) MRCoNS isolates 
exhibiting resistance to ≥3 antibiotic classes, compared to 
69 (6.4%) MSSA isolates and 72 (9.5%) MSCoNS isolates. 
Although more likely to be multidrug resistant, all MRSA 
and MRCoNS isolates were susceptible to vancomycin.
antibiotic resistance rates by patient’s 
age
Patient’
s age was known for 550 (14.0%) MRSA, 865 (22.0%) 
MSSA, 564 (14.3%) MRCoNS, 612 (15.6%) MSCoNS, 
509 (12.9%) P. aeruginosa, 460 (11.7%) H. influenzae, and 
374 (9.5%) S. pneumoniae isolates. Analysis of the mean 
percentage of in vitro resistance by patient’s age catego-
rized by decade of life showed differences among S. aureus 
(P<0.0001), CoNS (P<0.0001), P
. aeruginosa (P=0.0469), 
and S. pneumoniae (P=0.0172). For S. aureus, pairwise differ-
ences were evident between patients aged ≥80 years (≥35.2% 
resistance) and those aged <80 years (resistance between 
14.3% and 26.9%). Among CoNS, pairwise differences in 
resistance were identified in patients aged ≥70 years (≥31.3%)

vs those aged 10–19, 20–29, and 50–59 years (18.6%, 19.6%, 
and 23.0%, respectively), as well as in patients aged 80–89 
years (32.5%) vs 30–39 years (22.8%). When Tukey’s HSD 
test used the P<0.1 criterion for statistical significance, 
pairwise differences were observed between patients aged 
20–29 years (2.2% resistance) and those aged 50–59 years 
(10.4% resistance) among P
. aeruginosa isolates; however, 
no pairwise differences were identified for S. pneumoniae.
Consistent with the mean percentage of resistance findings, 
significant differences were found in in vitro methicillin resis-
tance specifically for S. aureus and CoNS based on patient’s 
age by decade of life (P<0.0001 for both; Figure 2). In general, 
methicillin resistance appeared higher in older age groups.
longitudinal trends in antibiotic 
resistance
Figure 3 presents in vitro rates of methicillin resistance 
among staphylococci over the 8 years of the ARMOR study. 
Methicillin resistance in S. aureus ranged from 23.4% to 
50.0%, whereas methicillin resistance in CoNS ranged from 
42.9% to 57.0%. While a small but significant decrease in 
resistance to methicillin was reported among S. aureus iso-
lates (P<0.0001), methicillin resistance did not decrease for 
CoNS over the 8-year time frame.

isolates, ARMOR is the only ongoing study to do so on 
a nationwide scale. With almost 5,000 isolates included, 
the present report evaluates cumulative resistance rates 
and trends in resistance over 8 years of the ARMOR 
study, expanding on previously published 5-year and 
7-year analyses.27,28 Current ARMOR results demonstrate 
substantial levels of in vitro resistance to commonly used 
antibiotics, particularly among staphylococcal isolates, of 
which nearly half were MR. Multidrug resistance analyses 
showed approximately two in every five staphylococcal 
isolates and approximately three in every four MRSA or 
MRCoNS isolates exhibited in vitro resistance to three or 
more antibiotic classes. Higher levels of overall mean in vitro 
resistance were found among isolates from elderly patients, 
especially when considering methicillin resistance among 
staphylococci. Isolates of S. pneumoniae showed high levels 
of in vitro resistance (~35%) to azithromycin and to oral 
penicillin, but were susceptible to fluoroquinolones and other 
tested drugs. Conversely, resistance among P
. aeruginosa 
and H. influenzae remained low (<9%) against almost all 
antibiotics tested. Significant declines in in vitro resistance 
were observed for many antibiotic-pathogen combinations, 
including a decrease in methicillin resistance among S. 
aureus, although an increase in trimethoprim resistance was 
seen among CoNS isolates.
Results from the current analysis are generally consistent 
with recent reports on the prevalence of in vitro methicillin 
resistance among staphylococci from ocular infections in the 
United States, with some variations. Miller35 reported similar 
levels of methicillin resistance among 967 S. aureus and 287 
S. epidermidis isolates from ocular infections collected at the 
Bascom Palmer Eye Institute between 2011 and 2015 (42.1% 
and 46.3%, respectively), in line with the current study. 
However, in an analysis of ocular pathogen data collected at 
Mount Sinai Hospital (2010–2015), which included 113 S. 
aureus isolates, a lower rate of MRSA (~25%) was observed; 
although a trend towards decreasing MRSA prevalence over 
the 6-year study period was noted (31.3% in 2010 to 14.1% 
in 2015), the change was not statistically significant.36 It is 
unclear whether the differences observed between studies 
reflect regional variations among predominant infective 
strains or are representative of a temporal decline in MRSA 
prevalence among ocular infections. Nonetheless, patterns 
of resistance among staphylococci to fluoroquinolones, 
macrolides, and other antibiotic agents (when tested) were 
similar to the current ARMOR analysis in these studies, 
with MR isolates exhibiting increased resistance compared 
to MS isolates.35,36
As previously reported,27–29 large differences in MIC90s 
for staphylococci were evident within the fluoroquinolone 
class of drugs, with older fluoroquinolones having higher 
MIC90s compared to newer ones. Besifloxacin had the low-
est MIC90s among staphylococci regardless of methicillin 
phenotype, attesting to its potent in vitro activity. Due to 
the lack of a systemic besifloxacin formulation, interpretive 
criteria are not available to categorize bacterial isolates as 
susceptible or resistant to besifloxacin. In the absence of such 
breakpoints, evaluation of besifloxacin MIC data alongside 
that of comparator agents allows for an assessment of its in 
vitro potency; however, the clinical relevance of these find-
ings is unknown. Previous studies have shown besifloxacin 
to provide balanced, potent inhibition of both bacterial DNA 
gyrase and topoisomerase, with minimum bactericidal con-
centrations generally within one dilution of the MIC.37 The 
lack of any meaningful changes in besifloxacin MIC90s for 
all study species over the 8-year period suggests its activity 
has remained stable over time and may be a reflection of 
that balanced inhibition. Of note, all staphylococcal isolates 
were susceptible in vitro to vancomycin, which had similar 
MIC90s to those for besifloxacin. The absence of vancomycin 
resistance and correspondingly low vancomycin MIC90s is 
particularly reassuring given that vancomycin is commonly 
compounded for ophthalmic use in the treatment of resistant 
ocular infections.
In terms of microbial resistance by patient age, the rates 
of overall mean resistance, and specifically methicillin resis-
tance, were higher in older patients, consistent with previous 
ARMOR data analyses and other studies.28,29,36,38–40 This asso-
ciation may be because older patients often spend more time 
in hospitals and health care centers, and are, therefore, more 
likely than younger patients to be exposed to antibiotic-resis-
tant bacteria common in these environments. Relationships 
between antibiotic resistance rates and patient age have also 
been reported in studies of systemic infections.41–43 A recent 
retrospective survey of data from 511 MRSA cases collected 
between 2008 and 2009 found that greater rates of resistance 
were observed among older patients for fluoroquinolones but 
not with other antibiotic classes.41
Analysis of resistance rates over time showed decreasing 
trends for in vitro resistance, which is promising and gener-
ally consistent with earlier ARMOR study reports, with few 
exceptions.27,28 The current analysis found decreases in resis-
tance to ciprofloxacin (among S. aureus, CoNS, MRCoNS, 
and P
. aeruginosa) and tobramycin (among S. aureus, MRSA, 
and P
. aeruginosa), as well as to azithromycin and chloram-
phenicol (among S. aureus). Of particular note, a decrease

in methicillin resistance was observed among isolates of S. 
aureus, but not CoNS, in the present study; this decline was 
not evident early in the ARMOR study,28 but was detected in 
the 7-year trend analysis27 and has continued over the current 
8-year time frame. Additionally, the significant increase in 
trimethoprim resistance among CoNS seen in this study was 
not reported previously.
In vitro resistance rates and susceptibility profiles in 
the present study are similar to reported data for bacterial 
isolates with specific ocular diagnoses, such as conjuncti-
vitis,44 keratitis,12,45 and endophthalmitis.13,15,17 In a 20-year 
review of antibiotic resistance among 398 S. aureus keratitis 
isolates (1993–2012), all were susceptible to vancomycin, 
and fluoroquinolone resistance was prevalent, with MRSA 
representing 30.7% of the total.12 A study assessing rates of 
antibiotic sensitivity among 998 isolates collected over 25 
years (1987–2011) from endophthalmitis cases also identified 
substantial resistance to fluoroquinolones in gram-positive 
isolates and a decreasing trend in resistance to aminoglyco-
sides, including tobramycin. However, findings from that 
study indicated an increase in methicillin resistance over 
time (from 18% and 31% among S. aureus and S. epidermi-
dis, respectively, to >50% each), in contrast to the present 
ARMOR analysis.13
In addition, current ARMOR results are generally consis-
tent with antibiotic resistance rates observed in surveillance 
studies for non-ocular infections requiring systemic antibi-
otic treatment.46–48 The Linezolid Experience and Accurate 
Determination of Resistance (LEADER) program recently 
reported high methicillin resistance rates among 3,031 (46%) 
S. aureus and 924 (59%) CoNS isolates collected primarily 
from bloodstream, respiratory tract, and skin and soft tissue 
infections in the United States between 2011 and 2015, with 
~60% and upwards of 70% of MR staphylococci exhibiting 
resistance to fluoroquinolones and macrolides, respectively.47 
Likewise, the latest United States report of 21,056 clinical 
S. aureus isolates tested in the Assessing Worldwide Anti-
microbial Resistance Evaluation (AWARE) study from 2010 
to 2016 found methicillin resistance rates decreased from 
50.0% to 42.2%; >65% of MRSA isolates showed resistance 
to fluoroquinolones and macrolides over the 7-year period.49 
Staphylococcal resistance rates for clindamycin and tetracy-
cline in the LEADER and AWARE studies were similar to 
those observed in the current study.47,48 Resistances among 
S. pneumoniae isolates in these studies were also largely 
consistent with those in the ARMOR study; oral penicillin 
and macrolide resistance rates were, respectively, 36.8% 
and 42.9% in LEADER (n=850)47 and 41.3% and 44.6% in 
AWARE (n=8,768),46 compared to 33.3% and 35.9% in the 
present analysis. Further comparisons of data from systemic 
infections with ARMOR results were hindered by differences 
in the antibiotic agents tested between studies.
Resistance trends based on source of isolate by geography 
for this 8-year dataset were recently published elsewhere 
and showed differences in antibiotic resistance rates based 
on geographic region.49 Significant trends were noted for S. 
aureus (high in the South [28.1%]; low in the West [16.8%]), 
S. pneumoniae (high in the Midwest [14.5%]; low in the West 
[7.6%]), and P
. aeruginosa (high in the Midwest [8.5%]; 
low in the West [2.9%]), with no regional differences found 
among CoNS and H. influenzae isolates. While the underly-
ing reasons for observed geographic disparities have yet to 
be elucidated, it is possible that climate variations and/or 
differences in prescribing patterns and antibiotic stewardship 
programs may impact regional antibiotic resistance rates.
The current analysis of ARMOR has several limitations. 
The study evaluated in vitro resistance rates in ocular patho-
gens based on systemic breakpoints, which were established 
based on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data 
obtained following systemic administration of antibiotics. 
Currently, associations between systemic breakpoints and 
topical antibiotic concentrations used in ocular infections 
have not been determined. It is assumed that concentrations 
achieved at the site of infection after topical ophthalmic use 
are at least as high as, if not higher than, those achieved 
after systemic administration.50 However, blinking and tear 
turnover, along with barriers to ocular penetration, work to 
decrease antibiotic concentrations following topical ophthal-
mic use. Another limitation is the potential for sampling bias 
due to the infrequent practice of culturing bacterial pathogens. 
With the exception of intraocular infections, ocular cultures 
are seldom collected during routine clinical practice, and 
infections are generally treated empirically. As a result, cul-
tures, when collected, may be representative of more severe 
infections that do not respond to initial empirical treatment.
Conclusion
Results from this analysis of 8-year ARMOR data demon-
strate small trends in antibiotic resistance, with encouraging 
decreases noted in rates of resistance to certain antibiotics. 
However, rates of antibiotic resistance among gram-positive 
organisms remain high, especially for methicillin resistance 
and multidrug resistance among staphylococci. These find-
ings are consistent with published studies in the scientific 
literature for both ocular and non-ocular staphylococcal 
infections. These data can assist health care practitioners in
