and Risk of Epilepsy in Offspring
Neda Razaz, MPH, PhD; Kristina Tedroff, MD, PhD; Eduardo Villamor, MD, MPH, PhD; Sven Cnattingius, MD, PhD
IMPORTANCE There is growing concern about the long-term neurologic effects of prenatal
exposure to maternal overweight and obesity. The causes of epilepsy are poorly understood
and, in more than 60% of the patients, no definitive cause can be determined.
OBJECTIVES To investigate the association between early pregnancy body mass index (BMI)
and the risk of childhood epilepsy and examine associations between obesity-related
pregnancy and neonatal complications and risks of childhood epilepsy.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A population-based cohort study of 1 441 623 live single
births at 22 or more completed gestational weeks in Sweden from January 1, 1997, to
December 31, 2011, was conducted. The diagnosis of epilepsy as well as obesity-related
pregnancy and neonatal complications were based on information from the Sweden Medical
Birth Register and National Patient Register. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression
models were used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs after adjusting for
maternal age, country of origin, educational level, cohabitation with partner, height, smoking,
maternal epilepsy, and year of delivery. Data analysis was conducted from June 1 to
December 15, 2016.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Risk of childhood epilepsy.
RESULTS Of the 1 421 551 children born between January 1, 1997, and December 31, 2011,
with covariate information available, 7592 (0.5%) were diagnosed with epilepsy through
December 31, 2012. Of these 3530 (46.5%) were female. The overall incidence of epilepsy in
children aged 28 days to 16 years was 6.79 per 10 000 child-years. Compared with offspring
of normal-weight mothers (BMI 18.5 to <25.0), adjusted HRs of epilepsy by maternal BMI
categories were as follows: overweight (BMI 25.0 to <30.0), 1.11 (95% CI, 1.04-1.17); obesity
grade I (BMI 30.0 to <35.0), 1.20 (95% CI, 1.10-1.31); obesity grade II (BMI 35.0 to <40.0), 1.30
(95% CI, 1.12-1.50); and obesity grade III (BMI�40.0), 1.82 (95% CI, 1.46-2.26). The rates of
epilepsy were considerably increased for children with malformations of the nervous system
(adjusted HR, 46.4; 95% CI, 42.2-51.0), hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (adjusted HR, 23.6;
95% CI, 20.6-27.1), and neonatal convulsions (adjusted HR, 33.5; 95% CI, 30.1-37.4). The rates
of epilepsy were doubled among children with neonatal hypoglycemia (adjusted HR, 2.10;
95% CI, 1.90-2.33) and respiratory distress syndrome (adjusted HR, 2.43; 2.21-2.66), and
neonatal jaundice was associated with more than a 50% increased risk of epilepsy (adjusted
HR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.33-1.63). The elevated risk of epilepsy in children of overweight or obese
mothers was not explained by obesity-related pregnancy or neonatal complications.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The rates of childhood epilepsy increased with maternal
overweight or obesity in a dose-response manner. Given that overweight and obesity are
modifiable, prevention of obesity may be an important public health strategy to reduce the
incidence of childhood epilepsy.

 E
pilepsy is one of the most common neurologic disor-
ders of childhood.1 Currently, 50 million persons are af-
fected by epilepsy worldwide.2,3 The cause of epilepsy
is poorly understood and no definitive cause can be deter-
mined in more than 60% of the cases.4,5 Preterm birth, low
birth weight for gestational age, chromosomal and congeni-
tal anomalies, neonatal convulsions, and low Apgar scores
are generally associated with increased risks of childhood
epilepsy.5-8
Maternal overweight and obesity have increased globally
duringthepast3decades,9,10andtheprevalenceofsevereobe-
sity, commonly defined as obesity classes II to III (body mass
index [BMI]≥35.0 [calculated as weight in kilograms divided
by height in meters squared]), has rapidly increased.11 There
is growing concern about the long-term neurologic effects of
childrenexposedtomaternalobesity.Obesityinpregnancyhas
been linked to systemic inflammation, altered endocrine re-
sponses, folic acid deficiency, and insulin resistance.12 Risks
of severe birth asphyxia, birth injuries, and congenital anoma-
lies increase with maternal obesity,13-16 which in turn may in-
fluence long-term neurologic and intellectual development.17
A few studies have found increased risks of intellectual dis-
ability,attention-deficit/hyperactivitydisorder,autism,andce-
rebral palsy in children whose mothers were overweight or
obese during pregnancy.17,18 Only 1 previous study examined
the association between maternal BMI and risk of epilepsy in
the offspring, and no association was found.19
We investigated the association between early preg-
nancy BMI and risk of childhood epilepsy in a nationwide co-
hort study including more than 1.4 million live singleton births
in Sweden. We also examined associations between obesity-
related pregnancy and neonatal complications and the risks
of childhood epilepsy.
Methods
Study Design and Population
This retrospective, nationwide cohort study included all live
singleton births at 22 or more completed gestational weeks
in Sweden from January 1, 1997, through December 31, 2011.
With the use of the person-unique national registration
numbers of mothers and their offspring,20 information on
births included in the Swedish Medical Birth Register was
cross-linked with the National Patient Register, Cause of
Death Register, Total Population Register, and Education
Register. The Medical Birth Register includes data on more
than 98% of all births in Sweden.21 This population-based,
clinically focused database contains information on antena-
tal, obstetrical, and neonatal care that is prospectively
recorded on standardized forms.21 The National Patient Reg-
ister contains diagnostic codes on hospital inpatient care
since 1987 and hospital outpatient care from 2001.22,23 The
Cause of Death Register includes information on all deaths in
Sweden.24 Diagnoses and causes of death since 1997 are
coded using the Swedish version of the International Statisti-
cal Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems,
Tenth Revision (ICD-10). Maternal educational level and
country of origin were obtained from the Education Register
and the Total Population Register.20,25 The study was
approved by the Research Ethics Committee at Karolinska
Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden. This study was based on
encrypted data, for which the ethics committees do not
require informed consent.
Exposures
Maternal BMI in early pregnancy was calculated from self-
reported height and weight measured in light indoor clothing
without shoes at the first antenatal visit, which occurs within
the first 14 weeks of gestation (ie, first trimester) for 90% of
pregnantwomeninSweden.21Wecomputedthemedianheight
across pregnancies for multiparous women to reduce mea-
surement error.26 Maternal BMI was categorized according to
the World Health Organization as underweight (BMI≤18.4),
normal weight (18.5 to <25.0), overweight (25.0 to <30.0),
obesity grade I (30.0 to <35.0), obesity grade II (35.0 to <40.0),
and obesity grade III (≥40.0).27
Maternal characteristics included age at delivery, coun-
try of origin, educational level, cohabitation with a partner,
parity, height, smoking during pregnancy, maternal epilepsy,
and year of delivery. Maternal age at delivery was calculated
as the date of delivery minus the mother’
s birth date. Parity
was defined as the number of births of each mother. Infor-
mation on cohabitation with the mother’
s partner was
obtained at the first antenatal visit. Women who reported
daily smoking at the first antenatal visit and/or at 30 to 32
gestational weeks were classified as smokers, whereas
women who stated that they were nonsmokers were classi-
fied as nonsmokers. Maternal epilepsy before the child’
s
birth was defined using the same algorithm that was used
for children (eTable 1 in the Supplement). Pregnancy compli-
cations included hypertension (pregestational and pre-
eclampsia), diabetes (gestational and mellitus), and
infection-related disorders.
Informationaboutthenewbornincludedbirthweight,ges-
tational age, sex, congenital malformations, birth trauma,
neonatal asphyxia-related complications, and more common
neonatal complications. Categorizations of the covariates are
provided in Table 1 and eTable 2 in the Supplement; specific
ICD-10 codes for diseases in the mothers and children are pro-
vided in eTable 1 in the Supplement.
Key Points
Question What is the association between body mass index
during early pregnancy and the risk of childhood epilepsy?
Findings In this population-based cohort study that included 1.4
million live single births, we found that maternal overweight and
obesity are associated with increased risks of childhood epilepsy.
Greater risks were noted with increasing body mass index.
Meaning Given that overweight and obesity are modifiable,
prevention of obesity during early pregnancy may be an important
public health strategy to reduce the incidence of childhood
epilepsy.

 In Sweden, all women are offered ultrasonography scan-
ning at 18 gestational weeks or earlier, and gestational age (in
completed weeks) was estimated using the following hierar-
chy:thedateofearlysecondtrimesterultrasonography(87.7%),
the date of the last menstrual period (7.4%), or a postnatal
assessment (4.9%).
In the study population of 1 441 623 live singleton births,
we excluded 2334 (0.2%) children who died before age 28 days
and 17 738 (1.2%) children with missing maternal and infant
personal registration numbers. We also excluded 168 645
children (11.7%) for whom information on maternal BMI was
missing. There were 1 421 551 births with complete informa-
tion on covariates.
Outcome
The definition of epilepsy in children was based on the 2011
recommendations of the International League Against Epilep-
sy’
sCommissiononEpidemiology,usingacombinationofhos-
pital and outpatient diagnoses from the National Patient
Registry.28,29 A case of epilepsy was identified if it met any of
the following conditions between January 1, 1997, and Decem-
ber 31, 2012:
1. an occurrence of 2 or more ICD-10 codes G40 and/or G41
(epilepsy and status epilepticus, respectively) on separate
dates or
2. an occurrence of 1 or more ICD-10 code R56 (convulsions
not elsewhere classified) and 1 or more ICD-10 codes G40
and/or G41 on separate dates; diagnosis of R56 had to pre-
cede that of G40 and/or G41.
The date associated with the first record of epilepsy was
considered the date of disease onset. Diagnosis of epilepsy was
restricted to the period after the child’
s 27th day from birth.
Statistical Analysis
Incidence rates of epilepsy in children were quantified by di-
viding the number of children with epilepsy by the total fol-
low-up time in child-years. We followed up each child from the
28th day of life until the date of the first diagnosis of epilepsy,
emigration, death, or end of follow-up (December 31, 2012),
whichever occurred first.
We compared crude rates between categories of maternal
BMIandothermaternalcharacteristicsaswellaspregnancyand
neonatal complications for the whole cohort and for children
born at term (≥37 weeks). To account for the varying lengths of
follow-up, we calculated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs with
the use of Cox proportional hazards models. Multivariate Cox
proportional hazards regression was used to compare the rates
of epilepsy between BMI categories and by levels of maternal
and neonatal risk factors. We specified the robust sandwich es-
timate of the covariance matrix to account for the correlations
of sequential births to the same mother in the study. The ad-
justed Cox proportional hazards model included maternal age,
country of origin, educational level, cohabitation with part-
ner, height, smoking, maternal epilepsy, and year of delivery.
A linear trend in the association of BMI with the offspring’
s epi-
lepsy in the child was assessed using the Wald test by introduc-
ing a variable representing ordinal categories of BMI as a con-
tinuous predictor into the models. The percentage hazard
difference per BMI unit was estimated as 100% × (HR − 1) from
modelswiththeBMIasacontinuousvariable.Interactionanaly-
ses were performed to investigate whether the association be-
tween maternal BMI and rates of epilepsy was different in chil-
dren born preterm (≤36) or term (≥37 weeks). The interaction
term was tested with the use of the χ2 test.
We conducted additional analyses to ascertain poten-
tially mediating effects of obesity-related pregnancy and/or
neonatal complications by introducing them as covariates into
the multivariate models. These analyses assumed a lack of in-
teraction between maternal BMI and maternal and neonatal
complications and no unmeasured confounders of the poten-
tial mediators and rates of epilepsy.30 Regression model fit was
assessed using the likelihood ratio test, and a 2-sided P value
<.05 was used to determine statistical significance. All analy-
ses were carried out with the use of SAS, version 9.4 (SAS
Institute). Data analysis was conducted from June 1 to Decem-
ber 15, 2016.

 Results
Of 1 421 551 children born between 1997 and 2011, 7592 chil-
dren (0.5%) were diagnosed with epilepsy through Decem-
ber 31, 2012. A total of 3530 (46.5%) of the children were fe-
male. The overall incidence of epilepsy was 6.79 per 10 000
child-years. The rates and HRs of epilepsy were slightly higher
among offspring of mothers who were born outside the Nor-
dic countries, had lower educational levels, lived without a
partner, were multiparous (≥4 births), or were smokers (eTable
2 in the Supplement).
A maternal diagnosis of epilepsy was associated with a
more than 4-fold increase in epilepsy rates in the offspring
(Table 1). Pregnancy complications (gestational diabetes, pre-
eclampsia, infections, and chorioamnionitis), cesarean deliv-
ery, and birth trauma were also associated with increased rates
of epilepsy. Most children who developed epilepsy were born
at term, but the rates of epilepsy increased by decreasing ges-
tational age, ranging from a 1.7-fold increased rate in moder-
ately preterm infants (32-36 weeks) to an almost 5-fold in-
creased rate in extremely preterm (22-27 weeks) infants.
The overrepresentation of congenital malformations
among children with epilepsy was mainly attributed to mal-
formations of the central nervous system (Table 1). Neonatal
convulsions, hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy, birth as-
phyxia, and low Apgar scores (0-3 or 4-6) at 5 minutes were
associated with considerably increased epilepsy rates. Rates
of epilepsy were also increased among children with neona-
tal infections, hypoglycemia, respiratory distress syndrome,
and jaundice. Restricting the analyses to children born at term
did not change our results (eTable 3 in the Supplement).
The adjusted rate of epilepsy increased linearly by mater-
nal BMI (Table 2) from 6.30 per 10 000 child-years among nor-
mal-weight women to 12.4 per 10 000 child-years among
women with obesity grade III. The rates of epilepsy increased
by 11% in children of overweight mothers compared with chil-
dren of normal-weight mothers; obesity grades I and II were
associatedwith20%and30%increasedrates,respectively;and
obesity grade III was associated with an 82% increase in epi-
lepsy (Table 2). In term births, the rates of epilepsy increased
consistently with maternal overweight and obesity severity;
only obesity grade III was associated with epilepsy in pre-
term births (test for interaction P = .89) (Table 3).
InthemediationanalysesofBMIandepilepsy,neitherobe-
sity-related pregnancy nor neonatal complications substan-
tially changed the association between maternal BMI and rates
of epilepsy (Table 4, adjusted models 2 and 3). When both neo-
natalandobesity-relatedpregnancycomplicationswereadded
tothemultivariatemodel,theassociationbetweenmaternalBMI
andratesofepilepsywasattenuated,butnoteliminated(Table4,
adjustedmodel4).Theassociationsalsopersistedafterexclud-
ing children with cerebral palsy (eTable 4 in the Supplement).
Discussion
In this large, population-based study, the rate of childhood epi-
lepsy increased with maternal overweight and obesity sever-
ity in a dose-response manner. We also found strong evidence
that several asphyxia-related neonatal complications are asso-
ciatedwithsubstantiallyincreasedratesofepilepsyandthatthe
less severe but more prevalent neonatal complications, includ-
ing neonatal jaundice, hypoglycemia, and respiratory distress,
couldpotentiallyincreasetheratesofchildhoodepilepsy.How-
ever, the elevated rates of epilepsy in offspring of overweight
orobesemotherscouldnotbeexplainedbyobesity-relatedpreg-
nancy or neonatal complications.

 Overall, we found a steady increase in the rate of child-
hood epilepsy across the entire range of maternal BMI. We are
aware of only 1 previous study investigating this issue, and no
association was found between maternal obesity and the risk
of childhood epilepsy.19 Reliance on a non–population-based
data source (ie, Medicaid records) and use of a strict case as-
certainment for diagnosis of epilepsy may have induced an un-
derestimation of the risk of childhood epilepsy and contrib-
utedtothelackofassociation.19Inourpopulation-basedstudy,
the definition of epilepsy was based on international
recommendations.28,29
Few studies have reported associations between prepreg-
nancy overweight and obesity and other long-term neurode-
velopmental outcomes of the children, such as intellectual
disability, lower cognitive performance, attention-deficit/
hyperactivity disorder, cerebral palsy, and autism.17,18,31 Given
the importance and sensitivity of fetal brain development and
itssusceptibilitytohormonalandinflammatoryreactions,even
at the early embryonic stage,1,6,32 it is possible that maternal
overweight and obesity increase the risk of brain injury, lead-
ing to a range of neurodevelopmental disorders. A meta-
analysis reported a 2-fold increased risk of major malforma-
tions in the central nervous system, specifically neural tube
defects, in the children of obese mothers.16 This finding lends
support to the hypothesis that epilepsy may result from the
gradual accumulation of environmental insults to the central
nervous system.4 Another potential mechanism by which ma-
ternalobesitymightaffectneurodevelopmentcouldbethrough
obesity-induced inflammation. There is increasing evidence
that maternal inflammatory conditions are associated with fe-
tal systemic inflammation, which increases the risk of neona-
tal brain injury33 leading to outcomes such as cerebral palsy
and epilepsy.6,34 In our study, fetal exposure to maternal in-
fections and chorioamnionitis were associated with overall
increased risks of epilepsy, but not when the analysis was re-
stricted to term births. Maternal obesity during pregnancy,

 regardlessofinfections,isalsoassociatedwithendothelialdys-
function and inflammatory upregulation, which may have a
lasting effect on fetal neurodevelopment.32,35 Evidence also
indicates that high levels of leptin that are observed in obe-
sityareassociatedwithplacentaldysfunction36potentiallydis-
rupting normal neurodevelopment in the children.
In addition, maternal overweight and obesity are related
to increased risks of pregnancy-associated diseases and neo-
natal complications13-15 that may be contributing to the in-
creased risk of epilepsy in children. A Swedish population-
basedstudyhasshownthatmaternalobesityisassociatedwith
increased risks of severe asphyxia-related complications in
term infants.15 This increased risk may be attributed partly to
shoulder dystocia37 and otherwise traumatic labor due to fe-
tal macrosomia.38 However, our findings did not change sub-
stantiallyafteradjustingforobesity-relatedpregnancyandneo-
natal complications, suggesting that maternal overweight or
obesity per se may play a critical role in fetal neurodevelop-
ment. Other underlying issues, including unmeasured ge-
netic, lifestyle, and environmental factors that interact with
obesity, could also contribute to this association.
We found strong evidence that asphyxia-related neonatal
complications other than neonatal convulsions or low Apgar
scores, including meconium aspiration and hypoxic ischemic
encephalopathy, are associated with markedly increased rates
of epilepsy. Previous studies have shown that children with a
historyofhypoxicischemicencephalopathyhad5timestherisk
of developing epilepsy.39 Furthermore, our study showed that
neonatal jaundice, hypoglycemia, and respiratory distress may
increase the risk of epilepsy. These findings persisted when
analyses were restricted to children born at term.
Few previous studies have explored the potential role of
more-prevalent neonatal complications on the risk of epi-
lepsyinchildren.6,40Moderatehypoglycemiafor3ormoredays
is associated with impaired neurologic development at 18
months.41 Respiratory distress has been linked to changes in
cerebralbloodflow,whichinturncanincreasetherisksofperi-
ventricular or intraventricular hemorrhage in the developing
brain.42 Even moderate degrees of hyperbilirubinemia have
been associated with an increase in the risk of minor neuro-
logic dysfunction throughout the first year of life.43
Moreover, we found higher rates of childhood epilepsy
among children whose mothers had epilepsy, gestational dia-
betes, and preeclampsia. Other factors associated with higher
ratesofchildhoodepilepsywerepretermbirth,lowbirthweight
for gestational age, birth trauma, birth asphyxia, and congen-
ital malformations. Chromosomal abnormalities, malforma-
tion of the nervous system, and neonatal convulsions were all
associated with substantially increased risks of childhood epi-
lepsy. These findings are in line with those of previous stud-
ies demonstrating robust associations between congenital
anomalies and neonatal convulsions and the development of
epilepsy.5,6 Convulsions in newborns with perinatal as-
phyxia are independently associated with early life brain in-
jury and later neurodevelopmental impairment.44
The strengths of our study include the use of a large, com-
prehensive, nationwide population-based data source, which
allowed us to study the rates of childhood epilepsy in rela-
tively small groups, such as offspring of mothers with BMI of
40 or more and in children with specific neonatal complica-
tions. We used a previously validated case definition for
epilepsy.28,29 In addition, prospective data collection mini-
mized the risks of selection and recall bias.
Limitations
Even though we relied on both hospital inpatient and outpa-
tient registries to capture maternal and neonatal complica-
tions, misclassification and underreporting of some diagno-
ses, such as maternal epilepsy, maternal infections, and
chorioamnionitis, should be considered. Any misclassifica-
tion would have been nondifferential, which generally re-
sults in an underestimation of rates. In addition, the cause of
epilepsy may be multidimensional, with interaction between
genetic and environmental factors. Environmental factors, in-
cluding maternal smoking, alcohol use, socioeconomic fac-
tors, receipt of antiepileptic drugs, and deficiency of vita-
mins, could potentially increase the risk of epilepsy in
offspring.45 Although we controlled for a broad range of po-
tential confounders, unmeasured and residual confounding
may have occurred due to factors not available in our data
sources.
Conclusions
This population-based study demonstrates that the risk of epi-
lepsy in offspring increased with maternal BMI category in a
dose-responsepattern.Furthermore,ourstudyprovidesstrong
evidencethatasphyxia-relatedneonatalcomplications,aswell
as less severe neonatal complications, including neonatal hy-
poglycemia, jaundice, and respiratory distress, indepen-
dently increase the risk of childhood epilepsy. Given that over-
weight and obesity are potentially modifiable risk factors,
prevention of obesity in women of reproductive age may be
an important public health strategy to reduce the incidence
of epilepsy.
