Homicides In Mexico Reversed Life
Expectancy Gains For Men And
Slowed Them For Women,
2000–10
ABSTRACT Life expectancy in Mexico increased for more than six decades
but then stagnated in the period 2000–10. This decade was characterized
by the enactment of a major health care reform—the implementation of
the Seguro Popular de Salud (Popular Health Insurance), which was
intended to provide coverage to the entire Mexican population—and by
an unexpected increase in homicide mortality. We assessed the impact on
life expectancy of conditions amenable to medical service—those sensitive
to public health policies and changes in behaviors, homicide, and
diabetes—by analyzing mortality trends at the state level. We found that
life expectancy among males deteriorated from 2005 to 2010, compared
to increases from 2000 to 2005. Females in most states experienced small
gains in life expectancy between 2000 and 2010. The unprecedented rise
in homicides after 2005 led to a reversal in life expectancy increases
among males and a slowdown among females in most states in the first
decade of the twenty-first century.
T
he second half of the twentieth cen-
tury was marked by major improve-
ments in health, living standards,
and mortality in most Latin Ameri-
can countries.1 But these improve-
ments have been reversed in recent years, as
Latin American countries have experienced a
marked increase in homicide rates in the 2000s.2
After six decades of sustained improvement in
life expectancy, Mexico experienced stagnation
in this indicator between 2000 and 2010 as a
result of an unexpected increase in homicides
(particularly of people ages 15–50) and an antic-
ipated increase in deaths due to diabetes3
(among people ages forty and older). However,
these changes were accompanied by reductions
in mortality from causes of death at young ages
(for example, perinatal conditions).4,5
The increase in homicides is at the heart of life
expectancy stagnation for males in Mexico be-
tween 2000 and 2010. Homicide rates increased
from 9.5 homicides per 100,000 people in 2005
to more than 22.0 per 100,000 people in 2010.6
As a result, there was a reduction of about 0.6
year in male life expectancy in the period
2000–10.5
Importantly, the stagnation in life expectancy
occurred during a time of substantial changes in
national public policies to improve the health
status of the Mexican population. Mexico imple-
mented an ambitious and comprehensive health
care reform in 2004, called the Seguro Popular
de Salud (Popular Health Insurance). The pro-
gram’s goal is to provide universal coverage to
the uninsured population.7 Empirical evidence
suggests that the Seguro Popular has led to im-
provements in the equitable distribution of
health resources, with increased coverage for
the uninsured.8 These improvements were ac-
companied by reductions in catastrophic and
out-of-pocket expenditures9 and increases in fi-
nancial protection for the beneficiaries in the

 medium term.10 However, it is still too soon to
know what impact the Seguro Popular has had
on health outcomes.
Although informative, national trends in life
expectancy conceal heterogeneity at the sub-
national level. National life expectancy in Mex-
ico is made up of state-specific mortality rates.
Thus, national life expectancy could be stagnant
because of an increase in homicides in some
states that was offset by reduced mortality for
diseases amenable to medical service (such as
infectious and respiratory conditions) in other
states.
For instance, mortality rates from diseases
amenable to medical service may improve in
the poorest states of the country (for example,
Oaxaca and other southern states) where, by law,
the government made especially significant ef-
forts to enroll the uninsured in the Seguro Pop-
ular.11 But independent of health gains that may
be occurring in other states, homicide mortality
increased in northern states (Chihuahua and
Baja California, which border on the United
States) and states on the Pacific coast (Sinaloa,
Michoacán, and Guerrero), and homicides have
slowly spread throughout the country.12
Given the increase in homicides in some states
and the large variation in how the Seguro Popu-
lar was implemented at the state level, under-
standing state-specific trajectories in life expec-
tancy is an important step toward explaining its
stagnation at the national level.
Study Data And Methods
We used data on deaths from vital statistics files
available through the Mexican National Institute
of Statistics and Geography to compute the pro-
portion of deaths by cause,age, sex,and state in a
given year.13 These data include information on
cause of death by age at the time of death, sex,
and place of occurrence. Additionally, we used
population and death estimates corrected for
completeness, age misstatement, and interna-
tional migration available from the Mexican So-
ciety of Demography to construct age-specific
death rates by sex and state.4
Cause-Of-Death Classification To identify
causes of death that could be affected by the
implementation of the Seguro Popular, we used
the concept of amenable or avoidable mortali-
ty.14,15 This concept assumes that there are some
conditions that should not cause death if effec-
tive and pertinent medical care is provided.
Deaths due to these conditions are a proxy for
the performance of health care systems.15
We used a recent cause-of-death classification
system
based
on
previous
studies.16,17
We
grouped causes of death into eight categories
(for details on the International Classification of
Diseases [ICD] codes for each cause, see online
Appendix Table 1).18
The eight categories are as follows: causes
amenable to medical service (deaths that could
be reduced by timely medical care or primary or
secondary prevention), causes sensitive to pub-
lic health policies and changes in health behav-
iors (for example, drunk driving, smoking, and
failure to use a seatbelt), homicide, diabetes,
ischemic heart disease, HIV/AIDS, suicide and
self-inflicted injuries, and all other causes (a cat-
egory labeled residual causes).We analyzed homi-
cide, diabetes, ischemic heart disease, and HIV/
AIDS separately from other conditions because
homicide and diabetes represent major causes of
death in Mexico,5 and all of these conditions are
amenable to both health behavior change and
medical service.16
We focused on cause-specific mortality below
age seventy-five for three reasons. First, we cal-
culated that about 93 percent of the change in life
expectancy at birth between 2000 and 2010 was
due to mortality changes below that age. Second,
cause-of-death classification is less reliable at
older ages.19 And third, health care and policy
or behavior interventions tend to be more effec-
tive at younger ages.16
We studied changes in life expectancy during
the decade by looking at two time periods, 2000–
05 and 2005–10. This allowed us to identify
changes in life expectancy between the periods
before and after the 2004 implementation of the
Seguro Popular and during the years when the
rise in homicides was documented. Significant
increases in coverage under the Seguro Popular
occurred inthe years after itsimplementation,so
it is likely to have had an impact on population
health through 2010.11
Methods We first calculated age- and sex-
specific death rates in five-year age groups up
to age 100 for the thirty-two Mexican states (in-
cluding the Distrito Federal).We estimated peri-
od life tables—which summarize mortality expe-
rience and indicate life expectancyfor people in a
specific time period—for 2000, 2005, and 2010
using standard demographic procedures.20 Then
we calculated cause-of-death contributions be-
low age seventy-five to differences in life expec-
tancy at birth between 2000 and 2005, and be-
tween 2005 and 2010, by sex and state using a
standard cause-decomposition approach.21
In addition, we carried out a sensitivity analy-
sis to examine the effect of migration between
states. Our analysis showed that emigration
from one state to another associated with vio-
lence between 2005 and 2010 was unlikely to
play a major role in our estimates because it
accounted for less than 1.5 percent of any state’s

 population (see Appendix Table 2).18
Limitations Our study had several limita-
tions. First, there are likely to be inaccuracies
in cause-of-death mortality figures because of
coding practices.19 To reduce these inaccuracies,
we focused on deaths before age seventy-five and
used broad cause-of-death categories from the
most recent ICD classification (ICD-10).
Second, we used the concept of avoidable mor-
tality as a proxy to capture the effect of the Se-
guro Popular on a set of causes of death. This
concept should be interpreted as an indicator of
potential weaknesses in health care and not as
definitive evidence of differences in the effective-
ness of health care over time and between the
states.14
Third, reductions in mortality from 2005 to
2010 were partly due to previously established
public programs (such as labor-based social se-
curity) and private health institutions and partly
due to changes in health risk factors (for exam-
ple, smoking status and diet).22 However, the
substantive increase in health care coverage
through the Seguro Popular8 also probably
played a major role in this period.
Fourth, our estimated effects of homicide mor-
tality on life expectancy are likely to be a lower
bound instead of the actual impact of homicide
on the average length of life because of the un-
derestimation of homicide deaths resulting from
undercounting, underreporting, and the large
number of missing individuals.23,24
Despite these limitations, we used the most
reliable data for Mexico to gauge the contribu-
tions of age and cause of death to changes in life
expectancy across states and over time.
Study Results
In Exhibits 1–4, the Mexican states in each re-
gion are arranged according to the negative im-
pact of homicide mortality on life expectancy in
2005–10.
All states except one (Quintana Roo) experi-
enced increases in male life expectancy at birth
from 2000 to 2005 (Exhibit 1). In contrast, male
life expectancydeclined in all states from 2005 to
2010. The magnitude of the decline in the latter
period offset most gains in life expectancy in the
former period. In fact, about two-thirds of the
states ended up with lower life expectancy in
2010 than they had had ten years earlier.
Female life expectancy showed a different pat-
tern over the decade, with some states experienc-
ing a continuous increase in life expectancy and
others showing a continuous decrease (see Ap-
pendix Exhibit S1).18 In contrast to the results for
males, females in most states had experienced
small gains in life expectancy by decade’s end.
Exhibits 2–4 show how homicide, causes ame-
nable to medical service, and diabetes, respec-
tively, contributed to changes in male life expec-
tancy at birth for the two periods. These are the
causes of death that contributed the most to
changes in life expectancy in both periods (for
all causes of death, see Appendix Exhibit S2).18
Cause-specific mortality for homicide (Exhib-
it 2) and causes amenable to medical service
(Exhibit 3) declined from 2000 to 2005 in most
states, leading to increases in life expectancy at
birth over the period. However, there was a clear
reversal in those increases from 2005 to 2010,
particularly in the case of homicide. In fact,
changes in mortality due to homicide caused
the largest decline in life expectancy over the
decade. The decline was most severe in the north,
with males in Chihuahua, Sinaloa, and Durango
experiencing a reduction in life expectancy of

indicate a decrease in life expectancy during the period.

Changes in mortality due to causes amenable
to medical service contributed to increasing life
expectancy for most states in both periods, al-
though one-third of states experienced declines
in life expectancy from 2005 to 2010 (Exhibit 3).
Similarly, changes in mortality due to causes
sensitive to public health policies and changes
in health behaviors (for example, lung cancer,
road accidents, and cirrhosis) also contributed
to rising life expectancy in most states during the
decade (see Appendix Exhibit S2).18
Although diabetes mortality increased in most
states during the decade, that change had a
smaller impact on changes in life expectancy
from 2005 to 2010 than it did on those changes
from 2000 to 2005 (Exhibit 4). In northern and
central states, changes in diabetes mortality had
a negligible effect on life expectancy from 2005
to 2010 because of a leveling off in diabetes mor-
tality rates during the period. In some states
(such as Chihuahua, Sinaloa, and Durango), di-
abetes mortality even declined from 2005 to
2010, leading to small increases in life expectan-
cy. Changes in diabetes mortality had a slightly
greater negative effect on life expectancy in the
south than in the other two regions of the coun-
try. However, changes in mortality from diabetes
led to an increase in life expectancy in one south-
ern state (Guerrero).
In contrast, in most states there were declines
in females’ rates of mortality due to causes ame-
nable to medical service and those sensitive to
public health policies and changes in health be-
haviors (see Appendix Exhibit S3).18 Homicide
mortality rates for females as well as males in-
creased after 2005, but the change had a smaller
impact on females’ life expectancy than on that
of males. Similar to males, females residing in
northern states had the largest increase in homi-
cide mortality from 2005 to 2010, with losses of
life expectancy of about half a year in Chihuahua
and about one-quarter year in Durango and
Sinaloa.
Among females, changes in diabetes mortality
resulted in sizable reductions in life expectancy
from 2000 to 2005 in most states. However,
almost all states in the northern and central re-
gions, and some states in the south, experienced
gains in life expectancy for females from 2005 to
2010 as a result of declines in diabetes mortality.
Even in southern states, where diabetes mortali-
ty continued to have a negative impact on life
expectancy, the effect was lower in the second
half of the decade than in the first half.
Contributions to changes in life expectancy by
mortality due to ischemic heart disease, HIV/
AIDS, and suicide were negligible for both males
and females (see Appendix Exhibits S2 and S3).18
Discussion
Life Expectancy Trends In Mexico from 2000
to 2010, life expectancy at birth deteriorated rel-
ative to the trend observed in the previous six
decades, during which the country experienced
an average increase of about four years of life
expectancy per decade.25 From 2000 to 2010,
women experienced a continuous increase in life
expectancy, although with very small incre-
ments, but life expectancy for men was stag-
nant.5 Our research sheds some light on this
national trend by showing that it is the result
of offsetting state-specific mortality trends, with
life expectancy increasing in most states from
2000 to 2005 but decreasing in every state from
2005 to 2010.
Effect Of Homicide And Diabetes On Life
Expectancy At Birth Our findings indicate that

 the downward trend in the second half of the
decade resulted from large increases in homicide
mortality in all states, which affected both males
and females. As a result, there were large reduc-
tions in life expectancy among males in all states
and a slowdown in life expectancy gains among
females. On average, men experienced homicide
rates ten times higher than those of women.26
The increase in male mortality from homicide
was such that the initial gain in life expectancy
from 2000 to 2005 was lost by the end of the
decade.
There were also increases in male mortality
from diabetes over the decade that led to reduc-
tions in average life expectancy. In contrast, fe-
males in most states experienced a reduction in
diabetes mortality that led to increasing life ex-
pectancy from 2005 to 2010.
Our results clearly indicate that homicides
were the main reason for the observed decline
in life expectancy from 2005 to 2010 among men
nationwide. The intensity and severity of the in-
crease in homicide mortality rates were such that
the gains in population health from improve-
ments in other mortality rates—both from
2000 to 2005 and from 2005 to 2010—were
largely wiped out. This led to the stagnation of
life expectancy at the national level from 2000 to
2010 for men at about seventy-two years, as pre-
viously shown.5 These findings are consistent
with previous research.10
Importantly, our results for the period from
2005 to 2010 indicate that the largest loss of life
due to homicide among males was concentrated
in five states (Chihuahua, Sinaloa, Durango,
Guerrero, and Nayarit), with over one year of
life expectancy lost in each. For example, males
in Chihuahua (the northern Mexican state bor-
dering New Mexico and Texas in the United
States) experienced a loss of life expectancy of
about three years from 2005 to 2010, and in 2010
they had a homicide rate of over twenty deaths
per thousand males younger than seventy-five
(authors’ calculations). To put these figures into
perspective, it took thirteen years (from 1991 to
2003) for Chihuahua to raise male life expectan-
cy by three years (from 69.3 years to 72.4 years),4
but this increase was completely reversed in a
five-year period (from 2005 to 2010).
We further estimated cause-age-specific de-
compositions to determine the ages that contrib-
uted the most to this decline in life expectancy
(see Appendix Table 3).18 Two-thirds of the de-
cline was due to mortality increases among
males ages 20–39 (37.15 percent for those
ages 20–29 and 31.52 percent for those ages 30–
39). The mortality rate for males ages 20–39 in
Chihuahua in the period 2005–10 reached un-
precedented levels: It was about 3.1 times higher
than the mortality rate of US troops in Iraq be-
tween March 2003 and November 2006.27,28
Although homicide mortality has typically
been associated with Mexican states linked to
drug cartel operations (such as Sinaloa and
Michoacán), our results also highlight increas-
ing rates of male homicide in states with histori-
cally low levels of homicide mortality (such as
Nayarit in the central region and Guerrero in the
south) (Exhibit 2). These results are consistent
with previous research showing that homicide
mortality increased in tandem with military op-
erations against drug cartels in states linked to
their operations but also that the increase has
slowly spread to the entire country.12
We also found that diabetes continues to be an
important cause of death in Mexico but that dia-

 betes mortality hada lowertoll on lifeexpectancy
in 2005–10 than it did in 2000–05. Among
males, changes in diabetes mortality led to re-
ductions in life expectancy in most states from
2000 to 2005 but had negligible effects on life
expectancy from 2005 to 2010. Results for fe-
males were more remarkable, with all but two
states in the northern and central regions
experiencing improvements in diabetes mortali-
ty, which led to increasing life expectancy from
2005 to 2010.
The smaller effect of diabetes mortality on life
expectancy in 2005–10 may have resulted from
increasing access to health care through the Se-
guro Popular. That view is supported by evidence
indicating that an increase in health care cover-
age through the Seguro Popular8 particularly
improved access to diabetes treatment and con-
trol among the poor.29
The increase in homicide mortality in Mexico
after 2005 suggests a rapid deterioration in life
expectancy. However, other countries in Latin
America have experienced an even faster in-
crease in homicide mortality.2 Mexico’s national
homicide rate in 2012 (21.5 homicides per
100,000 people) was still below that of other
Latin American countries such as Brazil (25.2),
Colombia (30.8), Belize (44.7), El Salvador
(41.2), and Honduras (90.4).2 Given the great
number of years of life lost associated with ho-
micide mortality in Mexico, it is likely that other
Latin American countries have been experienc-
ing even greater reductions in life expectancy
from homicide. Our results from Mexico high-
light the need to assess the impact of homicide
mortalityon population healthand lifeexpectan-
cy in otherLatinAmericancountries, as well as in
those countries’ regions and states.
Addressing Violence And Improving Popu-
lation Health Our results show that violence,
through homicide, has had devastating conse-
quences for the Mexican population. The Mexi-
can government has attempted to mitigate the
rise in violence through national-level judicial,
police, and penal reforms.30 However, the strat-
egies implemented by the government have pro-
duced
mixed
(and
sometimes
unfavorable)
results.12,31
For instance, Mexico’s homicide rate startedto
rise in 2006, which coincided with the imple-
mentation of a major national security strategy
aimed at reducing drug cartels’ operations and
violence in the country.12 Contrary to what was
expected, this policy has been associated with an
unprecedented increase in violence and homi-
cides in the country,12,31 consistent with our find-
ings. Even though the most recent data show a
decline in homicide rates in 2012 and 2013—
to 22.2 and 19.5 deaths per 100,000 people,
respectively—homicide rates in 2013 were still
more than twice as high as they were in 2005.13
There is a need for increased attention to pub-
lic health interventions that could be imple-
mented to change the factors that contribute
to violence in Mexico (such as factors related
to social, economic, and cultural conditions).
Our results suggest that approaches such as
epidemiological surveillance can be used to
strengthen policies to reduce violence. Evidence
from other countries such as Colombia suggests
that it is possible to reduce homicide mortality
rates by implementing community programs to
prevent violence that focus on lessening risk
factors (for example, alcohol use and firearm
possession).32,33

 Conclusion
Most people in Mexico have access to health
services through the Seguro Popular and other
public health programs and institutions. Howev-
er, our results reveal that there are still large
health disparities among states. Even more wor-
risome is the detrimental effect of homicide mor-
tality on population health, since the public
health improvements achieved in the period
2000–10 were reversed by the unprecedented
rise in homicides after 2005. The impact of the
increasing violence in the country extends be-
yond the loss of human life because of the im-
portant social and economic consequences for
those left behind. As long as the rate of homicide
continues to be high and violence remains prev-
alent in Mexico, it is likely that the health of the
population will continue to deteriorate.
There isno simple way to curtail the increase in
homicide mortality, but it is clear that the poli-
cies implemented in the past decade have not
controlled the high levels of violence in Mexico.
These policies should be discontinued, and new
strategies incorporating a public health perspec-
tive should be implemented to minimize the ef-
fects of violence on the health status of the Mex-
ican population. ▪
