Abstract
Objective—Eating disorders are severe psychiatric disorders of unknown etiology. 
Understanding how neuronal function affects food choices could help personalize treatment based 
on brain function. Here we wanted to determine whether disordered eating behavior is associated 
with alterations in the primary taste cortex's ability to classify taste stimuli, which could interfere 
with taste reward processing.
Method—One-hundred-and-six women, 27 healthy CW (age 26.15±6.95 years), 21 with 
restricting-type anorexia nervosa (AN; age 23.10±6.14 years), 19 recovered from restricting-type 
AN (recovered AN; age 26.95±5.31 years), 20 with bulimia nervosa (BN; age 25.15±5.31 years), 
and 19 with obesity (age 28.16±8.13 years), received sucrose, control solution or no taste 
stimulation during functional magnetic resonance brain imaging. Multivariate Bayesian pattern 
analysis (decoding) and cross-validation tested taste classification accuracy (adjusted for 
comorbidity, medication use, taste perception, interoception and brain activation volume).
Results—For sucrose versus control solution, classification accuracy differed (F=2.53,p<0.041). 
Post-hoc tests indicated higher classification accuracy in CW compared to women with AN 
(p<0.016) or obesity (p<0.027), and in recovered AN compared to AN (p<0.016) or obesity 
(p<0.047) groups. Taste stimulation resulted in sparse insula voxel activation across all groups.
Discussion—Reduced classification accuracy across stimuli in women with AN or obesity could 
indicate low brain encoding discrimination of stimulus quality, which could contribute to altered 
reward activation and eating drive that is not adjusted to nutritional needs. This deficit appears to 
normalize with recovery from AN, but adjusting food flavor intensity could aid in the treatment of 
individuals with AN or obesity.

Introduction
Eating disorders (EDs) are severe psychiatric disorders (1), with anorexia nervosa (AN) 
characterized by fear of weight gain and underweight, and bulimia nervosa (BN) by binge 
eating and purging but normal weight (2). Usually associated with more food intake than 
physiologically needed is obesity, defined by a body mass index (BMI, kg/m2) ≥30. EDs and 
obesity are associated with increased mortality (3, 4), their underlying causes are considered 
multifactorial and treatment success is modest (4-8).
Basic science and human in vivo brain imaging research has suggested that food restriction 
and overeating are associated with alterations in reward circuit function.
Taste is an important driver of food intake (9) and invariably associated with distinct 
neuronal patterns in the insula, the brain's primary taste cortex (10). The insula connects to 
ventral striatum, orbitofrontal cortex and amygdala, higher order brain structures that control 
how much we eat (11, 12). Thus the insula has a “gate-keeper” function for taste information 
transmission and could have a central role in the pathophysiology of disordered eating (13). 
The insula is also important for interoceptive awareness (responding to body cues (14)), 
which tends to be altered in EDs (13).
Insula size is altered in EDs (15, 16), and functional alterations in the insula have also been 
reported repeatedly. For instance, in AN after recovery, insula, anterior cingulate and striatal 
activation were reduced during repetitive sucrose application (17), but insula and cingulate 
response were increased when applied randomly (18). In BN, sucrose and milkshake 
activated insula and frontal cortex less than in CW (19, 20). Imaging research in obesity 
most commonly implicated the insula (21), with increased or decreased activation depending 
on anticipation or receipt of visual or actual food stimuli (22, 23).
Functional brain imaging typically studies strength of activation (dependent variable) in 
response to specific stimuli (independent variable) and may inform on specific brain circuits 
(24, 25). The measured signal is the sum of many neurons coming together, although some 
neurons may contribute much and others little to the overall signal. In contrast, so called 
multivariate (multi-voxel) pattern analysis, or decoding, goes the opposite direction and uses 
brain activation patterns as the independent variable to classify task conditions (26-28). 
Multivariate pattern analysis is used to investigate how brain regions code stimuli-specific 
information as distinct patterns of neural activity. This then allows for differentiation of 
distinct perceptual states by assessing the characteristic distribution of voxel activation. 
Thus, decoding tries to identify a neuronal “fingerprint” to predict a condition or 
psychological state (24, 29). However, there may be many equally likely solutions of voxel 
activation patterns, and to overcome this problem, one can use constraints or priors in a 
multivariate Bayesian approach, by testing how voxel patterns are distributed within 
predefined models (26, 27). Cross-validation then can test the brain's “pattern classification

 accuracy”, or how well a person's distinct activation pattern (associated with the stimulus or 
psychological state) can be generalized to the full data set, which can be compared across 
individuals and groups.
Various studies have applied decoding strategies to brain activation. For instance, decoding 
has been used in the study of vision, finding that distinct activation patterns could predict 
discrete objects (30). Decoding was also used to study attention states, memory generation, 
decision making bias and lie detection (31, 32), as well as interoception of pain, which could 
be relevant for ED research (13). To the best of our knowledge decoding has not been 
studied previously in EDs or obesity.
Here we tested the hypothesis that insula taste classification accuracy is reduced in 
individuals with disordered eating behavior. We sought to 1) determine the best model of 
pattern activation in this region across participants and 2) compare taste classification pattern 
accuracy between groups, while correcting for potential confounds such as comorbidity, 
medication use, brain volume, but also interoceptive or taste perception differences, factors 
that may fluctuate with anxiety and self-restraint (33, 34). We anticipated two possible 
scenarios. One, AN could be associated with higher and obesity with lower pattern 
classification accuracy with the idea that under- and overweight are associated with higher 
and lower response to food stimuli (23). Alternatively, having in mind that AN and obesity 
may respond stronger or weaker to any type of stimulus, both groups might distinguish taste 
stimuli poorly as they may code stimulus salience similarly high or low. We studied two 
additional groups, individuals recovered from AN to test whether such deficits would 
improve with recovery, and individuals with BN to strengthen the hypothesis that any 
alterations seen are more dependent on weight or other biologic factors than simply on ED 
cognitions.
Methods
Study Participants
We recruited 106 women, 27 healthy comparison women (CW), 21 women with restricting-
type AN, 19 women recovered from restricting-type AN, 20 women with BN, and 19 
women with obesity (Table 1.). The Colorado Multiple Institutional Review Board approved 
the study; all participants gave written informed consent. Participants received $160 for the 
brain imaging session and completion of assessments.
AN (35) was defined as underweight below 85% of weight expected for age and height, 
severe fear of gaining weight, body image distortion, lack of menstrual cycle, but without 
binge eating/purging behavior. Individuals with BN had binge eating/purging episodes at 
least twice per week for at least three months and self-evaluation was unduly influenced by 
shape and weight. Obesity was defined by BMI≥30 (36). Individuals recovered from AN had 
a history of restricting-type AN, normal weight, regular menses and normal exercise patterns 
for ≥1 year. Healthy CW had no history of psychiatric or major medical illness, were not 
taking medication, and were within normal BMI range life long.

 Individuals with AN or BN were within their first 1-2 weeks of inpatient or partial 
hospitalization treatment, and had no electrolyte, blood count or other laboratory 
abnormalities. A doctoral level interviewer assessed psychiatric diagnostic status using the 
structured clinical interview (SCID (35)) for DSM-IV diagnoses. CW, women recovered 
from AN, women with BN or obesity were studied during the first ten days of the menstrual 
cycle to keep hormonal variation low (37).
Psychological Assessments
Study participants completed self-assessments for: 1) drive for thinness, bulimia, body 
dissatisfaction and interoceptive deficits (Eating Disorder Inventory-3) (38); 2) harm 
avoidance (Temperament and Character Inventory) (39); 3) state and trait anxiety 
(Spielberger State and Trait Anxiety Inventory) (40); 4) depression (Beck Depression 
Inventory) (41); and 5) reward and punishment sensitivity (Sensitivity to Reward and 
Punishment Questionnaire, revised) (42).
Brain Imaging Procedures
Prior to breakfast, participants rated randomly presented, unmarked taste stimuli (distilled 
water; five sucrose solution strengths, Mallinckrodt Chemicals, Phillipsburg, NJ: 2%, 4%, 
8%, 16%, 1Molar; and artificial saliva: 25mM KCl, 2mM NaHCO3) (43) for sweetness, 
‘absent’ (1) to ‘extreme’ (9), and pleasantness, ‘dislike extremely’ (1) to ‘like extremely’ 
(9), on 9-point Likert scales. Between 7.00 and 8.00AM, AN and BN groups ate breakfast 
according to their meal plan, comparison, obese, and women recovered from AN had 
breakfast matched to the average ED program meal plan breakfast. Blood oxygen level 
dependent functional magnetic resonance brain imaging (fMRI) was performed between 
8.00 and 9.00AM (GE Signa 3T scanner, T2* weighted echo-planar imaging, voxel size 3.4 
× 3.4 × 2.6mm, TR 2100ms, TE 30ms, angle 70°, 30 slices, interleaved acquisition, and 
2.6mm slice thickness with 1.4mm gap).
Taste Task
Individuals received three taste stimuli during fMRI imaging(43): 1 mol/L sucrose solution 
(100 trials), no solution (100 trials), and artificial saliva (80 trials). Individuals learned to 
associate each taste stimulus with a paired conditioned visual stimulus (CS) that is 
probabilistically associated with its US: the no-solution (null) CS was followed in 20% of 
trials by sucrose (unexpected sucrose receipt, positive-prediction error), and the sucrose CS 
was followed in 20% of trials by no-solution (unexpected Sucrose omission, negative-
prediction error). The first 10 trials were fixed CS shape for sucrose followed by US sucrose 
delivery to establish an initial stable association between the CS sucrose shape and US 
sucrose taste (43). Trials began with the CS (2 seconds), followed by US delivery, tongue 
swish and swallow and awaiting the next trial (4 seconds). Each trial lasted 6 seconds. Every 
2.1 seconds a brain image was recorded. All other trials were fully randomized. Taste stimuli 
were applied using a customized programmable syringe pump (J-Kem Scientific, St. Louis, 
Missouri) controlled by E-Prime Software (Psychological Software Tools, Pittsburgh, 
Pennsylvania) and triggered by MRI-scanner radiofrequency pulse (19). Task duration was 
28 minutes. We only included trials with matching CS–US association in order to focus on 
taste classification and reduce effects from the prediction error response.

 Brain Imaging Analysis
Brain-imaging data were preprocessed and analyzed using Statistical Parametric Mapping 
software (http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm5/). Images were realigned to the 
first volume, normalized to the Montreal Neurological Institute template, and smoothed with 
a 6-mm FWHM Gaussian kernel (44). Image sequences were manually inspected and 
images with artifacts or movement >1 voxel removed. Data were modeled with a 
hemodynamic response convolved boxcar function, using the general linear model, including 
temporal and dispersion derivatives, autoregression, and 128s high-pass filter.
We computed three first level contrasts for each subect: 1) sucrose versus no solution; 2) 
artificial saliva versus no solution; 3) sucrose versus artificial saliva.
Analysis 1 (group by condition ANCOVA)—To test whether groups differed in insula 
activation strength, we used a random effects, whole brain analysis (p<0.05 family-wise 
error corrected (FWE), cluster size ≥5 voxels) (23).
Analysis 2 (Multivariate Bayes, MVB, Decoding Analysis)—Step 1. In the MVB 
approach (27) the first step is to identify the optimal model of activation distribution in the 
relevant brain region. The prediction is that brain activation is distributed according to a 
sparse model solution. The area of interest on the functional images and for the contrasts of 
interest are identified (from the taste activation task). The next step is a “greedy search” 
procedure. Here the algorithm's goal is to detect the best model of activation distribution in 
relation to the task condition. The brain region of interest is partitioned in subsets of 
increasing size and tested for type of activation distribution: In a sparse model few voxels 
have large variance while most have small variance. In a smooth model, there is a sparse 
representation of activation that is spatially coherent over the brain anatomy. The support 
model is a type of distributed model where each pattern is an individual voxel and a large 
number of distributed patterns are expressed. The sparse, support, and smooth MVB models 
were tested for each of the three contrasts of interest (1. expected sucrose contrasted against 
expected no solution; 2. expected sucrose contrasted against expected artificial saliva; 3. 
expected artificial saliva contrasted against expected no solution) for each participant. 
Expectation–maximization (EM) uses the highest voxel weights for fitting the model. This 
method creates the log-evidence value. The solution with the largest log-evidence indicates 
the optimal set of activation distribution. EM algorithms can be prone to over-fitting with 
higher order polynomials. However, this problem is reduced with increasing number of data 
points and the fMRI study and each condition (sucrose, artificial saliva, no-solution) had 80 
trials with 228 images across those 80 trials should provide adequate number of data points 
(45). Step 2. After delineation of the adequate distribution model, the log evidence can then 
be used for cross validation to identify classification accuracy. Cross-validation partitions 
data into subsets so that the analysis is performed on one (training) subset, while the other 
(test) data are retained to confirm and validate the initial analysis. In k-fold cross validation, 
data is randomly partitioned into k partitions, training the classifier on all but one and 
evaluates classification performance on that partition. This procedure is repeated for all k 
partitions (here k=8). Cross-validation prediction accounts properly for serial correlations 
and confounds by ensuring that the cross-validation weights cannot be influenced by test

 data and that the prediction is conditionally independent of the training data. Classification 
accuracy was then compared across groups.
While there are other classification algorithms such as support vector machine or Gaussian 
models, we chose MVB for various reasons. We were not interested whether brain response 
can separate patients from CW, which is a typical goal of classification algorithms. Rather 
MVB tests different distribution models and compares the model evidence for each 
participant. Other methods base their analysis on the expectation that a sparse model is at 
hand. In light of different volumetric measures of the insula across eating disorders we 
wanted to make sure that we test various models in the eating disorder groups and use the 
most accurate data for cross validation.
Statistical Analysis
Behavioral data (ANOVA) and classification accuracy (univariate general linear model 
including factors and covariates, ANCOVA) were analyzed with SPSS-22 software (IBM-
SPSS, Chicago, IL). Post-hoc group comparisons were assessed with Dunnett's T3, and 
estimated marginal means were computed for classification accuracy and multiple-
comparison corrected using bootstrap. Several variables were hypothesized a priori to be 
possible confounds and included in the between-group model (5 group ANCOVA, CW, AN, 
BN, recovered AN, obese individuals): number of activated voxels (adjusting for volume 
differences), interoceptive deficits, sweetness perception of control solution as well as 
sucrose solution; in addition comorbid anxiety and depression diagnoses and medication use 
were included as factors in the model. Pearson correlation analysis tested brain-behavior 
correlations. Sweetness perception across sucrose concentrations was tested with repeated 
measures ANOVA.
Results
Demographic Variables (Table 1.)
Age was similar between groups. BMI was higher in obesity and lower in AN and recovered 
AN groups compared to CW. Interoceptive deficits, harm avoidance and state and trait 
anxiety were higher in AN and BN groups compared to CW, depression scores were 
elevated in AN, recovered AN and BN. Drive for thinness and body dissatisfaction were 
elevated in all groups compared to CW, bulimia scores were elevated in BN and obesity. 
Sweetness and pleasantness perception were similar between groups, as was slope for 
sweetness perception across concentrations (F=0.819, p<0.516). Some individuals with AN 
or BN had comorbid psychiatric disorders or were on medication.
Analysis 1 (group by condition ANCOVA)
The 5-group by 3-taste condition contrast including covariates depression, anxiety and 
medication use, with and without interoceptive deficits or sweet taste perception did not 
result in significantly different insula activation, however within groups, all contrasts showed 
positive posterior and mid insula activation.

 Analysis 2 (Multivariate Bayes, MVB, Decoding Analysis)
Classification accuracy (mean±SEM) for sucrose versus no solution (CW :70.7±1.6; AN:
70.5±1.3; BN:68.9±1.4; obesity:68.8±1.4; Recovered AN:69.7±1.5) was not significantly 
different between groups (df=4,F=0.615,p<0.7). Classification accuracy for artificial saliva 
versus no solution (CW: 70.2±1.4; AN:69.8±1.2; BN:70.3±1.3; obesity:69.9±1.2; recovered 
AN:69.5±1.3) was also not significantly different across groups (df=4,F=0.109,p<0.9).
Sucrose versus artificial saliva classification accuracy differed significantly across groups 
(df=4,F=2.601, p<0.041), with lower classification accuracy (mean±SEM) in AN 
(56.6±0.8;p<0.016) and obesity (58.1±0.9;p<0.027) compared to CW (60.4±1.0), and lower 
values (p<0.047) for AN versus recovered AN (60.0±0.9;p<0.016) and obesity versus 
recovered AN. BN (58.20±0.89) did not differ significantly from any group (Figure 2.). The 
voxel weights in each group were significantly greater for sparse versus smooth or support 
distribution (Figure 1., Supplemental Figure 1): CW sparse 79.2±45.4, smooth 13.1±17.4, 
support 8.2±14.4, F=49.5, p<0.001; AN sparse 75.0±50.6, smooth 17.9±28.3, support 
12.0±24.1, F=19.4, p<0.001; BN sparse 79.0±43.8, smooth 17.5±23.7, support 9.8±19.2, 
F=30.3, p<0.001; obesity sparse 75.4±34.1, smooth 11.5±11.6, support 5.2±9.4, F=62.7, 
p<0.001; recovered AN sparse 74.2±37.1, smooth 15.0±20.2, support 7.8±20.7, F=34.2, 
p<0.001.
Correlation Analyses (Table 2.)
CW—Classification accuracy for sucrose versus artificial saliva contrasts correlated 
positively with number of activated voxels (261.9±28.7;r=0.688,p<0.001) and negatively 
with sucrose sweetness perception (r=−0.527,p<0.005).
AN—Classification accuracy for sucrose versus artificial saliva was positively correlated 
with number of activated voxels (257.6±48.9;r=0.712,p<0.001).
Recovered AN—Classification accuracy for sucrose versus artificial saliva was positively 
correlated with interoceptive deficits (r=0.550, p<0.015).
BN—Classification accuracy for sucrose versus artificial saliva was positively correlated 
with number of activated voxels (274.5±70.1;r=0.679,p<0.001); classification accuracy for 
sucrose versus no solution correlated negatively with sucrose sweetness (r=−0.690,p<0.001).
Obesity—Classification accuracy for sucrose versus artificial saliva correlated positively 
with number of activated voxels (247.6±48.9;r=0.853,p<0.001) with a tendency to positive 
correlation with interoceptive deficits (r=0.425, p<0.070).
Discussion
This study indicates that AN and obesity are associated with reduced taste classification 
accuracy in the insula when contrasting caloric sucrose against a control solution. Pattern 
classification accuracy in recovered AN and BN did not differ significantly from the CW 
group and suggests that taste classification accuracy alterations could be adaptations to an 
abnormal eating and weight state.

 The overall accuracy of insula pattern classification between 50% and 70% may seem low 
but is comparable with other studies that investigated brain pattern classification (46, 47). 
Larger regions of interest are used for decoding and pattern classification and typically result 
in higher classification accuracy; we selected the bilateral insula as a larger yet anatomically 
defined region. There was no group difference in classification accuracy for sucrose or 
control solution tested against no solution. This suggests that the perceptual state to sucrose 
or control solution applied individually, which includes taste perception but also general 
sensory information, is encoded adequately in AN and obesity. However, when directly 
contrasting the two taste stimuli, to remove effects of texture and other sensory stimulation 
in the mouth, encoding differences more specific to taste quality become apparent. Thus 
there may be deficits in neuronal encoding of distinct taste qualities in AN and obesity, but 
this may remit with recovery from AN as in our recovered sample. Those results seem to be 
in line with previous studies. Perception of individual taste stimuli in EDs was not altered 
(48), but research indicated lower olfactory or gustatory stimulus discrimination in EDs (49). 
Some studies in obesity have also shown difficulties with taste differentiation (50), and 
sweet taste sensitivity increases with weight-reduction in obesity (51, 52).
What determines such alterations could occur on a variety of levels. For instance, leptin and 
other hormones are altered in EDs and obesity and affect taste perception (53-55); reduced 
insula pattern classification could be due to primary structural changes within the insula 
(15), or alternatively could result from altered taste signal processing in afferent pathways to 
the insula (56).
The insula has repeatedly been implicated in ED and obesity pathophysiology (13, 17-21, 
23, 57, 58). The bilateral anterior and middle insula responds to taste stimulation (59) and 
transmits information to ventral striatal and orbitofrontal reward pathways (11). The 
anteroventral insula is connected to the amygdala (12) and aids in generating internal 
emotional states (60). Especially the right anterior insula has been associated with self-
recognition, “abstract representation of oneself” (61) and interoceptive awareness (62). Left 
anteroventral insula activation is related to gastric distention (14) and self-reported fullness 
(63). Thus, many intertwined functions are processed and alterations on different levels 
within the insula could contribute to our findings. Altered insula function could have 
important clinical implications. If normal taste discrimination is disturbed, then it is possible 
that normal insula inputs to basal ganglia and higher order taste processing are altered (64). 
Subsequently, other circuits such as subcortical reward or prefrontal cognitive-emotional 
circuits could have greater influence on determining the drive to eat or not eat. AN and 
obesity have been associated with altered dopamine related reward function (23), elevated or 
reduced cognitive control (65, 66) as well as high anxiety (67), and disturbances in those 
circuits could increasingly drive eating pathology the more afferents from the insula are 
altered. In fact, such a “multifaceted” concept for behavior modulation has been suggested 
previously for the psychopathology of obesity (68). Hypothetically, if individuals with AN 
and obesity do not receive appropriate insula signals in response to taste stimuli but basal 
ganglia dopamine hyper- (AN) or hypo- (obesity) activation respectively have a stronger 
impact on food choices, then it could be possible that reducing flavor intensity during 
treatment of AN and enhancing flavor for obesity could counteract those subcortical

 mechanisms. Normal insula classification accuracy in the recovered AN group provides 
hope that classification accuracy alterations do improve with recovery.
Limitations
We can only speculate at this point why AN as well as obesity groups showed similarly 
reduced classification accuracy when contrasting sucrose versus artificial saliva. Response to 
taste stimuli may be similarly increased or decreased across stimuli in AN or obesity (18, 
23) and the result when contrasting stimuli against each other may be for each case reduced 
classification accuracy. This will require further research. We included medication use and 
comorbid conditions as covariates in the analysis but cannot exclude entirely their possible 
effects (69, 70). Brain volumes were different in parts of the insula in individuals with EDs 
or obesity in past studies, which could have affected the findings; however, we corrected for 
the number of activated voxels to adjust for such effects. Interoception was altered in EDs, 
which could have affected the perception of taste but was included as a covariate to adjust 
for such effects. We included the bilateral insula in the analysis and sub-regions could have 
shown different results, but we felt it would be important to include the entire insula in the 
analysis in order not to exclude important aspects of the circuitry (59). The classification 
accuracy for taste solution versus no stimulation was relatively high with around 70% for all 
participants, but was lower for sucrose versus control solution. This could be due to 
contributions of general aspects of the taste stimuli such as water based solution texture and 
temperature, which were similar for the study stimuli. However, smaller sub-regions of the 
insula could have provided more refined results, thus future studies will need to investigate 
insula subdivisions. Classification accuracy in BN was normal, however, a larger sample size 
may have shown that also the BN group has lower values. Taste pleasantness and disgust 
also have important influence on internal response to stimuli and brain response (71, 72). In 
this study we aimed to avoid conditioned emotional response and we chose a highly sweet 1 
molar sucrose solution and a neutral control solution as stimuli. What we did not specifically 
test was disgust experience. Disgust is a complex emotion that can be related to taste stimuli, 
but even more so comes into play in everyday situations that for instance involve social and 
moral values. We could not identify commonly used disgust measures in taste fMRI research 
but the Disgust Scale (73) is a widely used assessment tool. Its dimensions Core Disgust, 
Animal Reminder Disgust, and Contamination-Based Disgust can not necessarily be related 
to taste experience in this paradigm, but measures form this scale have been associated with 
for instance OCD and it is possible that measures from this scale could be predictive of 
eating disorder diagnosis and this in turn could be related to brain function. Disgust in fact 
has been associated with anterior insula activation (74) and therefore differing experience of 
disgust across groups could have had impact on the brain response or classification accuracy 
measure. This will need further investigation in the future.
In conclusion, pattern classification is relatively new to fMRI brain imaging analysis, but 
provides information that goes beyond strength of activation and toward understanding of 
neuronal patterns, which could inform about innervation and provide a more refined 
approach to brain function. Based on the study results, we propose that very basic coding 
mechanisms for taste quality are altered in AN and obesity. ED cognitions should therefore 
not be responsible for this alteration, but under- and over-weight or food deprivation and

 overstimulation might drive the results observed. The functional significance of these results 
will need further study, but normal values in individuals recovered from AN suggest that 
taste stimuli coding may be state dependent and recover with weight restoration.
