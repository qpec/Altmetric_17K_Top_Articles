Abstract
Ageing is the major risk factor for cancer development. Hallmark of the ageing process is represented by
inflammaging, which is a chronic and systemic low-grade inflammatory process. Inflammation is also a hallmark of
cancer and is widely recognized to influence all cancer stages from cell transformation to metastasis. Therefore,
inflammaging may represent the biological phenomena able to couple ageing process with cancer development.
Here we review the molecular and cellular pathway involved in age-related chronic inflammation along with its
potential triggers and their connection with cancer development.

Background
Inflammation, inflammaging and cancer
Ageing is a nearly universal biological process character-
ized, in multicellular organisms, by the progressive loss of
cells functions and tissues renewal due to complex, hetero-
geneous and dynamic mechanisms and affected by several
genetic, epigenetic, environmental and fortuitous factors [1,
2]. The term “inflammaging” is used to define the systemic
and sterile (in the absence of infection) low-grade chronic
inflammation status that is nowadays considered a central
biological mainstay of the ageing process [3, 4]. Indeed,
inflammation is a beneficial process as an acute, transient
immune response to harmful conditions but with ageing
there is a reduction in the capability to endure with
antigenic, chemical, physical and nutritional triggers and it
becomes chronic and of low grade, leading to tissues
dysfunction and degeneration [5, 6].
Numerous evidences show how apparently different age-
related
pathologies,
including
cancer,
cardiovascular
diseases and type 2 diabetes reveal a common inflammatory
background [7, 8]. Epidemiological studies demonstrate the
relationship between increased levels of inflammatory
mediators like Interleukin(IL)-6 or C-reactive protein
(CRP) to multiple age-related diseases [9]. In fact, inflam-
maging is characterized by the establishment of a systemic
proinflammatory state with increased level of circulating
interleukins such as IL-6, IL-1 and Tumor Necrosi Fac-
tor(TNF)-α and inflammatory markers, such as CRP [6].
This results from the activation of signalling networks crit-
ical to inflammation, such as those regulated by the Nuclear
Factor (NF)-kB transcription factor, along with a variety of
different sources of the inflammatory stimuli triggering and
sustaining inflammaging, such as senescent cells, the meta-
inflammation, the gut microbiota and nutrition [10–12].
In the nineteenth century Rudolph Virchow was the first
to hypothesize a connection between inflammation and
cancer, but only in the last two decades researchers have
produced striking evidences on the role played by the in-
flammatory process in promoting cancer [13, 14]. Indeed,
not only cancer can arise on sites of chronic inflammation
but also a pro-inflammatory microenvironment, sup-
ported by inflammatory cells and mediators, is an essential
component of cancer and one of its hallmarks [15–17].
Chronic inflammation is, thus, associated with all stages of
cancer development increasing its risk, supporting cancer
initiation, promoting cancer progression, and supporting
metastatic diffusion [10]. Recently, it has been demonstrated
that preventive treatment with anti-inflammatory drugs like
aspirin reduce the incidence and mortality for colorectal
cancer [18]. This leads the way to the potential preventive
and therapeutic role of the modulation of cancer-associated
inflammatory microenvironment [19].
The aim of this review is to explore the role of the main
actors contributing in the development of inflammaging
and cancer.

 Sources and modulators of inflammaging
The ageing and the inflammaging act at different levels of
complexity involving several tissues and organs as well as
the immune system and our associated ecosystems (gut
microbiota). All of these factors are thought to contribute
to the systemic inflammatory state, through the imbalance
of pro-inflammatory and/or anti-inflammatory mediators
(Fig. 1) [6, 20].
Immunosenescence
In the elderly, many alterations of innate and acquired
immunity have been described and viewed as deleterious,
hence the term immunosenescence. Immunosenescence is
a complex process involving multiple reorganizational and
developmentally regulated changes, rather than simple
unidirectional decline of complete immune function. On
the other hand, some immunological parameters are com-
monly notably reduced in the elderly, and reciprocally
good function is tightly correlated to health status.
Whereas innate immunity is relatively well preserved in
elderly, acquired immunity is more susceptible due to
both the functional decline associated with the passage of
time, and to antigen burden to which an individual has
been exposed during lifetime. This chronic antigenic
stress, which affects the immune system throughout life
with a progressive activation of macrophages and related
cells contributes to determine an inflammatory status.
Our immune system is quite efficient in fighting acute in-
fections in young people, but not particularly efficient in
responding to chronic stimuli, especially when they occur
late in life. This leads to an increased production of in-
flammatory mediators associated with the presence of
chronic infections [8, 20, 21].
Cellular senescence
Cellular senescence is characterized by a state of perman-
ent cell-cycle arrest due to exposure to stressful stimuli
such as telomere erosion, oncogene activation, oxygen free
radicals (ROS), chemicals and ionizing radiation [22]
Therefore, cellular senescence is widely considered a
tumor suppressing mechanism but growing evidences link
this process to hyperplastic and degenerative diseases
through chronic inflammation [23, 24]. In fact, senescent
cells despite their growth arrest are metabolically and
transcriptionally active and set up a specific crosstalk with
their microenvironment elicited by the synthesis of a wide
number of secretory protein [25, 26]. This phenotype is
called
“senescence-associated
secretory
phenotype”
(SASP) and is considered a key process for our current
understanding on the link between cellular senescence, in-
flammation and cancer development [24, 27].
Replicative senescence in normal cell is due to critical
telomere erosion that activates DNA damage response
and persistent p53 activation with cell cycle arrest [28,
29]. Severely damaged DNA (e.g. double strands break)
and oncogene activation or loss of tumor suppressor in-
duce cellular senescence through p53 activation accom-
panied by p21 expression [28–32]. DNA damage can
also activate p16, which is a second barrier to prevent
growth of transformed cells through senescence [33].
Once established, senescent cells gradually develop the
secretory phenotype largely mediated by the transcription
factors (NF)-kB and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein beta
(C/EBPb) induced by the upregulation of DNA damage re-
sponse effectors like NBS1, ATM and CHK2 [34–36]. SASP
associated secretory proteins include cytokines (most not-
ably IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8), numerous chemokines

 (chemoattractants and macrophage inflammatory proteins),
growth factors [hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), transform-
ing growth factor(TGF)-β, granulocyte-macrophage colony
stimulating factor (GM-CSF)] and matrix-remodelling en-
zymes [37, 38]. Importantly, SASP expression profile varies
among different tissues and different triggers but IL-6 and
IL-8 are highly conserved and have a major role in main-
taining the SASP in senescent cells [37, 38]. Moreover, the
paracrine signalling operated through SASP has been dem-
onstrated to induce senescence in surrounding cells there-
fore propagating this process throughout the tissue [39–41].
Overall SASP-associated mediators cooperate to establish a
pro-inflammatory environment and to recruit immune cells
into the senescent tissue. This inflammatory state along
with the immune cells infiltration surrounding senescent
cells removes the damaged and transformed cells [42].
However, it has been demonstrated that senescent cells
increase with age, and this can be interpreted either as an
effect of reduced clearance ability (and so senescent cells
gradually accumulate) and/or because aged individuals
generate senescent cells faster than their immune system
can handle [23]. The accumulation of senescent cells, typical
of ageing tissues, is therefore associated with an altered
microenvironment orchestrated by the activation of NF-kB
pro-inflammatory program (i.e. increased pro-inflammatory
cytokines, extracellular degrading enzymes, growth factors).
In vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that this
process not only alters the normal tissue and structure
function but, importantly, can stimulate the growth of
nearby malignant cells exerting a positive selection on
cancer-initiating cells and stimulating cancer progression
[24, 43, 44].
In addition to SASP, another type of senescence associ-
ated inflammatory response (SIR) has been described. It
shares few genes expression features with SASP and is
mainly a cell autonomous mechanism with a small number
of secreted factors and with no recruitment of immune
cells to the senescent tissue. SIR can be interpreted as an
intermediate state between homeostasis and overt inflam-
mation, associated with many pathological conditions (e.g.
obesity, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidaemia). It is still unclear
why some senescent cells start SIR and other SASP but this
two phenotypes may represent a continuous spectrum of
an inflammatory process, where SIR arises first and later
evolve into SASP [27].
Self-debris triggers of inflammaging
Ageing is associated with a progressive accumulation of
damaged macromolecules and cells (self-debris) due to in-
creased production and/or inadequate elimination. These
waste products derive from cellular and metabolic process
and are released as a consequence of cell/organelle injury.
Importantly, self-debris can mimic bacterial products and
can activate the innate immunity as endogenous danger-
associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). Hence, damaged
cellular and organelle components, ROS and metabolites
(e.g. ATP
, fatty acids, urate crystals, ceramides, cardiolipin,
amyloid, succinate, per-oxidized lipids, advanced glycation
end-products,
altered
N-glycans
and
HMGB1)
are
recognized by innate immunity receptors [45, 46]. Toll-like
receptor family (TLR), intracellular NOD-like receptors
(NLRs) and cytosolic DNA sensors initiate a reaction that
leads to the upregulation of inflammation associated pathway
and mediators. In particular TLRs stimulate inflammation
through Myd88-mediated NF-kB and activator protein
1(AP-1) activation. DAMPs derived activation of NLRs (par-
ticularly Nlrp3) leads to the inflammasome assembly and
consecutive secretion of several proinflammatory mediators.
As self-debris accumulates, the innate immune response to
DAMPs
become
chronic
and
maladaptive
leading to
inflammaging [47].
Gut microbiota
The bacterial population of the gut microbiota (GM) repre-
sents the largest number and concentration of microbes of
the human body and it has been demonstrated to take part
in many physiological and pathological processes [48, 49].
The homeostasis of this ecosystem composed by microbiota,
the gut associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) and the intestinal
mucosa is strictly dependent on a physiological low-grade
inflammation that secures its symbiotic feature [50].
Ageing is associated with changes in the microbial com-
position of gut microbiota with an increasing presence of
Bacteroides in the elderly compared to the higher presence
of Firmicutes in younger adults [51]. Several studies have also
showed the correlation between microbial diversity, frailty
scores and environmental factors- such as dietary pattern- in
elderly individuals [51–53]. In this context, the alteration in
gut microbiota composition seems to be also intrinsically
connected with the aged sustained alteration in gastrointes-
tinal tract (e.g. reduction of intestinal motility, poor dentition,
modification of salivary characteristics) [54]. Importantly, the
modification of gut microbiota in elderly can facilitate the
onset of dysbiosis and the prevalence of pathogenic species
in the intestinal microbial composition and this has been as-
sociated with increased level of systemic pro-inflammatory
markers (IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α, CRP) [51–53]. The association
between gut dysbiosis and cancer is, therefore, not only lim-
ited to a direct pathogenic role exerted by specific bacteria
on the intestinal epithelium but it is also linked to an overall
derangement of this ecosystem that has systemic conse-
quences through inflammatory pathways [49, 55].
Finally, a variety of sources are responsible for triggering
and maintaining inflammaging at local and systemic level
and it is thought that aged-associated change in gut micro-
biota can represent an important trigger of the inflamma-
ging processes and the associated pro-tumorigenic state.

 The striking role played by the gut microbiota in health
maintenance as well as in the development of different
pathologic conditions is leading to the development of
preventive and therapeutic approach using the modulation
of the gut microbial community [49, 56, 57]. As the ageing
gut microbiota is increasingly recognized as a fundamental
player in in the ageing process, being a source of systemic
chronic inflammation, it is intriguing to elucidate the role
of its potential modulation on ageing.
Obesity, nutrition and metaflammation
Ageing is associated in many people, particularly in West-
ern countries, with an increase in visceral fat that leads to
obesity along with insulin resistance [58]. Moreover, epi-
demiological data suggest a significant association be-
tween increased body mass index and several types of
cancer, such us pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, colon
cancer, post-menopausal breast cancer and many others
[59, 60]. Even though the molecular links between obesity
and cancer are not yet completely elucidated, it is now
widely accepted that obesity itself is responsible for a
chronic inflammatory state [61]. Obesity-induced inflam-
mation can be described as metaflammation: a low-grade,
chronic inflammatory state orchestrated by metabolic cells
in response to an excess of nutrients and energy [5]. An
important feature of obese inflammation is that it origi-
nates from metabolic signals and within metabolic cells
such as the adipocyte. Indeed the exposure to excessive
levels of nutrients, in particular of glucose and free fatty
acids, induces a stress activation that in turn triggers in-
flammatory intracellular signalling pathways.
The major intracellular contributors to the induction of
inflammation in metabolic tissues are represented by c-
jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), inhibitor of κ kinase (IKK),
and protein kinase R (PKR) [62]. These kinases ultimately
regulate the downstream transcriptional programs activa-
tion of transcription factors AP-1, NF-κB, and interferon
regulatory factor (IRF), resulting in increased expression
of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, C-C motif
chemokine ligand (CCL)2, or IL-1β, IL-6 [59, 62]. Over
time, this low-grade inflammation may induce the recruit-
ment and activation of many immune cells, such as mac-
rophages, mast cells, and various T cell populations,
driving the adipose tissue toward a modified environment
resulting in a stronger pro-inflammatory response [59].
The inflammation induced by nutrient excess is main-
tained with no resolution and the inflammatory pathways
continue to reinforce each other, from metabolic cell
signals of distress to immune cell responses [62].
A large body of evidence indicates that both quantitative
and qualitative characteristics of nutrition have a profound
effect on the development of a pro-inflammatory carcino-
genic environment [63]. As a consequence, nutrition influ-
ences the incidence, natural progression and therapeutic
response of malignant diseases, both in humans and in
preclinical animal models through modulation of chronic
inflammation [64]. Beyond the undeniable links among
quantitative
overnutrition,
obesity,
inflammation
and
elevated cancer risk, epidemiological studies have linked
cancer to qualitative disequilibria in food composition [63].
The Western-type diet, which is high in red meat, high-
fat dairy products, refined grains, and simple carbohydrates,
has been associated with higher levels of CRP and IL-6.
The Mediterranean diet and more in general diets high in
fruit and vegetable intake have been associated with lower
levels of inflammation [65–69]. Several researches have also
associated specific nutrients with different level of inflam-
matory markers. The impact of different nutrients on the
systemic body inflammation has been experimentally con-
densed into one-dimensional numeric values. The “dietary
inflammatory index” (DII) weights each major macronutri-
ent and multiple micronutrients on the basis of their gen-
eral proinflammatory effects, as measured, for example, by
assessment of C-reactive protein in serum [63]. This index
significantly correlates with the risk of developing postmen-
opausal breast cancer, colorectal cancer, lung cancer in
smokers, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, bladder cancer, and
nasopharyngeal carcinoma [70–75].
Among the different factors that can modulate ageing
inflammaging and metaflammation nutritional intervention
plays a critical and interesting role. The reduction of obesity
through bariatric surgery is associated with a decrease in
cancer mortality [76]. Several animal cancer models have
shown a significant impact of the fasting and feeding cycles
in cancer growth and in particular starvation and low cal-
oric diets seem to play the greater role through immuno-
modulation and anti-inflammatory effects [64]. Moreover,
specific dietary patterns, all sharing a prevalent plant-based
diet, seem to greatly impact longevity in different popula-
tion
through
the
interaction
between
nutrients
and
nutrient-sensing pathways such as those regulated by IGF1
[77, 78]. In this context and from a preventing standpoints
experimental and epidemiological studies have often dem-
onstrated the potential role of polyphenols containing food
in the prevention of neurodegenerative diseases and cancer,
particularly modulating cellular stress response pathways
associated with inflammaging [79–81]. Given the evidence
discussed above it appears plausible to attempt dietary in-
terventions or to provide food supplements to promote
long-term and systemic modulation of chronic low-grade
inflammation process (in the form of inflammageing and
metaflammation), in an anticancer perspective strategies
and towards the enhancement of health status of the elderly
population [7, 82].
In this context, an important role is played by epigenetic
modulation of gene expression where microRNAs are
among the main players. MicroRNAs (miRs) are small, non-
coding RNAs involved in the regulation of transcriptional
Leonardi et al. Immunity & Ageing  (2018) 15:1 
Page 4 of 7
 and translational processes and represent one of the most
abundant classes of regulatory molecules [83]. miR regula-
tion entails both repressing and activating gene expression,
by interacting with complementary sequences in coding and
non-coding regions of their mRNA targets [84]. The
specificity of miRs targeting is low and a single miR can
target hundreds of mRNAs. However, a group of miRs
can regulate complex biological processes, including
inflammaging, cellular senescence and tumorigenesis,
by acting in a coordinated fashion on pathways of
functionally related genes [85, 86]. Moreover, an in-
creasing number of studies has shown that environ-
mental factors, including diet, cigarette smoke, stress,
virus
can
modulate
miRs
expression
and
activity.
Thus, miRs are able to couple environmental expos-
ure to specific human phenotype and disease through
gene expression modulation [87, 88].
MicroRNAs are also involved in the ageing process. In
particular, mir-21, mir-146a and mir-126 participate in
the regulation of the NF-kB activated pathways that is
central in cellular senescence, inflammaging and cancer
development [89]. Moreover, an interesting aspect emer-
ging from microRNAs studies is that centenarians may
have a different miRs profile [90]. Several preclinical and
clinical studies in different age-associated disease, in-
cluding cancer, show that miRs can represent not only
an early diagnostic markers but also an important tool
for risk-based patients’ stratification [91, 92]. Further-
more, taken together these evidences support that miRs
modulation might a be a potential tool to interfere with
those pathways involved in the ageing process and in
age associated diseases including cancer.
Conclusions
Age is the most important risk factor for cancer devel-
opment and the increase in life expectancy will heighten
both medical and social consequence of this and other
age-related disease.
The complexity of the ageing process and its players
has been progressively unrevealed by the thorough effort
operated by researchers leading to the comprehension
that inflammation represent the common milieu of the
ageing process and age-related pathologies. Cronic anti-
gen load, cellular senescence, self-debris damage re-
sponse, gut microbiota, metaflammation and miRs all
together influence and foster inflammaging but how they
interact and what is their relative weight is still to be
elucidated.
The deep comprehension of the processes involved
in inflammaging will open the possibility for thera-
peutic interventions leading to an increased control of
age-associated disease and ultimately to a healthier
ageing.
