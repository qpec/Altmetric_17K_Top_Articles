Expenditure in Australia

Objective: To determine whether overweight or obesity among children (aged 2 to �5 years) is associ-
ated with direct healthcare costs, after adjusting for child, household, and socioeconomic characteristics.
Methods: A longitudinal cohort analysis was performed in 350 children aged 2 years assessed over 3
years of follow-up. Child weight status was determined from mean BMI z-scores at 2, 3.5, and 5 years,
and healthcare utilization including medicines, nonhospital, hospital, and emergency care was determined
by data linkage. Using adjusted multivariable regression analyses, the relationship between total 3-year
healthcare costs and weight status was examined. Observations took place in Sydney, Australia, between
2011 and 2014.
Results: After adjustment for significant maternal and sociodemographic characteristics, healthcare costs
of children with obesity (BMI z-score >2SD) were 1.62 (95% CI 1.12-2.34, P 5 0.01) times those of chil-
dren with healthy weight. However, costs of overweight children were similar to those of healthy weight
(P 5 0.96). The additional 3-year costs of healthcare for a child with obesity compared with healthy
weight were $AUD 825 (95% CI $135-$2,117) for general patients and $AUD 1332 (95% CI $174-$4,280)
for concession card holders.
Conclusions: Prevention of obesity in early childhood may have concurrent benefits in reducing health-
care expenditure.

Introduction
Childhood obesity is a serious public health challenge (1) and is
becoming an increasing problem in very young, preschool children,
under 5 years (2). Worldwide, the estimated prevalence of overweight
and obesity for children under 5 was reported to be 6.9% in 2010,
while in countries such as the USA, UK, and Australia, this figure
may be as high as 20% to 23% (3-5). This is important, not only
because of tracking to poorer health outcomes in later childhood, ado-
lescence, and adulthood (6-8), but also because, at a health system
level, overweight and obesity represents a major economic burden.
The economic argument for early prevention of childhood obesity is
usually framed with respect to improving outcomes of chronic dis-
ease that occur in later life, thus reducing long-term but not neces-
sarily short-term costs (9). However, there is also evidence in
school-age children for an association between overweight and obe-
sity and higher medication use (10), higher hospitalization costs,
(11) higher nonhospital costs (12,13) and more outpatient and emer-
gency department (ED) visits (14). Few of these studies have exam-
ined total healthcare costs across all these sectors. In their recent
review, John et al. (15) conclude most studies find excess healthcare
costs associated with childhood obesity but suggest more detailed anal-
yses are required. A particular gap is the evidence relating to the asso-
ciation between healthcare costs and obesity in very early childhood,
under 5 years. As this represents a period of relatively high healthcare
use (16,17), it is also potentially a time when the healthcare costs of
children with obesity and overweight could be substantial.
In this study, we examine the association between total healthcare
costs and weight status in a prospective cohort of preschool-aged
children between 2 and �5 years, while controlling for child and
family sociodemographic characteristics. These data were collected
during the 3-year follow-up of a randomized controlled trial to
reduce childhood obesity, the Healthy Beginnings Trial (HBT)
(18,19).

 participant-level data linkage to four separate administrative data-
bases covering medicine use, hospital and nonhospital care, and
emergency care. Our hypothesis was that overweight or obesity
among preschool-aged children was associated with higher direct
healthcare costs than children with healthy weight.
Methods
Study design and population
We conducted an observational longitudinal analysis of 350 pre-
school children aged 2 to �5 years who were part of the HBT Phase
2 follow-up study (18). The HBT tested the effectiveness of an early
childhood obesity intervention, with the active intervention (Phase
1) delivered in the first 2 years of life (20,21). In this health promo-
tion intervention, qualified early childhood nurses visited parents in
their homes for individual support and education for breastfeeding,
healthy infant nutrition, and physical activity. Participants were first-
born children of mothers in a socioeconomically disadvantaged area
of Sydney, Australia. Eligibility criteria included singleton births
and a minimum gestational age of 37 weeks. Mothers were aged 16
years and over and spoke conversational English. The study details
have been reported previously (21). The present analysis examined
data from HBT Phase 2 (18) between 2011 and 2014, which fol-
lowed children over the 3 years between their second and fifth birth-
days, after the intervention had been completed. As there were no
significant differences in outcomes between the intervention and
control groups during Phase 2 (19), and no differences in direct
healthcare costs between the groups (P 5 0.42), we carried out
these analyses without stratification by treatment allocation.
The HBT study was approved by the Sydney Local Health District
Research Ethics Review Committee (X10 0312). Data linkage was
approved by the New South Wales (NSW) Population Health Serv-
ices Research Committee (HREC/11/CIPHS/29). Informed consent
of parents was obtained for all participants.
Primary outcome: Total healthcare costs
HB participants who consented to Phase 2 of the study were invited
at the child’s 3.5-year assessment to take part in an economic sub-
study, which required giving consent for healthcare data linkage. Total
healthcare utilization, including hospital, nonhospital, emergency, and
medicine use was determined retrospectively and prospectively over
the 3-year period from the child’s second birthday, by participant-
level data linkage to four administrative databases. Data on general
practitioner (GP) and specialist consultations, tests, and diagnostics
were recorded via each child’s unique Medicare number under the
Medicare Benefits Scheme (MBS). Data on medicine use were
recorded through the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS). The
Australian Government’s Medicare provides access to medical serv-
ices, including free or subsidized doctor and specialist treatment and
the PBS provides access to listed medicines at reduced cost. MBS and
PBS administrative data capture costs of all subsidized treatment and
include both government and patient out-of-pocket contributions. The
level of out-of-pocket contributions is determined by patient status as
concessional or general. Families may qualify for a concession card
through work status, low income, and/or certain health conditions.
Hospitalizations and ED use were determined through data linkage
to the NSW Admitted Patient Data Collection, and the NSW Emer-
gency Department Data Collection. Data linkage was carried out by
the Centre for Health Record Linkage using probabilistic matching
on participant’s name, birth date, and address. Hospital episodes
were costed using guidelines from NSW Cost of Care Standards
(22), using Australian Refined Diagnostic Related Group (AR-DRG)
primary diagnosis codes provided in the linked data sets, and cost
weights (relative to the average cost of hospital separations). Presen-
tations at emergency were costed according to the triage category
using urgency and disposition cost weights applied to the average
cost of an emergency presentation (22). The cost of ambulance
transportation was estimated using NSW Ambulance Service current
rates and included in the cost of emergency care.
All items were valued in Australian dollars with a base year of
2014, inflated appropriately using the health consumer price index
(23). We determined healthcare costs from a government perspec-
tive, since most healthcare in Australia is paid for by the govern-
ment. Australians are entitled to free treatment at public hospitals
and emergency, but for MBS and PBS items, there is some level of
patient co-payment. These patient out-of-pocket costs were reported
separately but not used in the analyses.
Measurement of weight status
Height and weight were measured by research assistants at home
visits undertaken when children were 2, 3.5, and 5 years old. Height
was measured to the nearest 0.1 cm using a portable stadiometer.
Two height measurements were taken; a third measurement was
taken if the first two differed by 0.5 cm or more, then the mean of
these values was calculated. Weight was measured to the nearest
0.1 kg using digital scales (Wedderburn, Sydney Australia), while
children were wearing light clothes and no shoes. BMI for age z-
scores at 2, 3.5, and 5 years were calculated from height and weight
using World Health Organization (WHO) software, AnthroPlus (24);
then child weight status was determined from the mean of the three
BMI z-score readings. In recognition of the complexities in defini-
tion of weight status in childhood, and in order to simplify nomen-
clature, we defined underweight (<22 SD), healthy weight (22 to
1 SD), overweight (>1 to �2 SD), and obesity (>2 SD), based on
WHO criteria for children (25).
Child, mother, and family characteristics
Children’s birth weight categories were determined from linked hospital
data and dichotomized as low birth weight (<2,500 g) or not. Breast-
feeding status was collected during telephone interviews at 6 months of
age. Sociodemographic characteristics were collected at trial baseline,
using standard questions from the NSW Population Health Survey (26).
These included questions on maternal age, country of birth, marital sta-
tus, education and employment status, and household questions on
income and language spoken at home. Patient status as concessional or
general was determined from children’s PBS claims history.
Statistical analysis
All analyses were conducted in Stata v13.0 (27). Descriptive statis-
tics of child and family characteristics and mean healthcare costs by
each characteristic were determined. The main analysis examined
the association between total healthcare costs (including, medicines,
nonhospital, hospital, and emergency care) and weight status. As
99.7% of participants incurred healthcare expenditure over the 3

 years of follow-up, the standard two-part cost models were unneces-
sary. For the analyses of total healthcare costs, we used a logarith-
mic transformation of cost data; this accounted for the skew and
provided easy interpretation of regression coefficients. For one child
with zero costs between age 2 to �5, we imputed the median 3-year
costs of participants with 0- to 2-year costs in the same range (low-
est 5th percentile) in order to calculate the logged costs. We used
univariable linear regression to examine the association between
logged total healthcare costs and child and family characteristics. A
multivariable model investigating the association of healthcare costs
and BMI category was adjusted for all covariates with P < 0.20 in
the univariable analyses, and the final adjusted multivariable model
was presented with all coefficients with P < 0.05.
Supplementary analyses were carried out to identify what were the
drivers and potential reasons for differences in total costs by weight
status. We wanted to identify whether higher total healthcare costs
might be explained by higher use of a particular sector or a higher
cost of care. We examined healthcare costs by each sector as both
aggregated (total) and disaggregated mean costs per child over 3 years
and presented the results graphically. We then determined whether
the probability of using each healthcare service was associated with
weight status, using adjusted multivariable logistic regression. For
those with nonzero costs in each of the four health sectors (i.e., any
use), we also determined the mean cost of care, by weight status.
Finally, using descriptive statistics, we also examined broad reasons
for hospitalizations based on AR-DRG Major Diagnostic Categories
(http://www.aihw.gov.au/hospitals-data/ar-drg-data-cubes/).
Results
There were 465 participants of HBT Phase 2 and of the 369 children
completing follow-up, 363 consented to data linkage. Of these, 13
were not successfully linked to one or other of the healthcare admin-
istrative databases, leaving 350 participants (95%) for analysis. Sum-
mary characteristics of these participants are shown in Table 1.
Mean total healthcare costs per child over 3 years from a govern-
ment perspective were $2,698 and mean out-of-pocket costs were
$138. Most children (61%) were classified overall as having a
healthy weight, while 29% were overweight, and 9% had obesity.
The mean 3-year healthcare costs for children of healthy weight
were $2,516, for those who were overweight were $2,609, and for
those with obesity were $4,124.
In the univariable analyses, significant predictors of higher child-
ren’s healthcare costs were child obesity, mother’s employment sta-
tus as home duties/student, and being a concession card holder
(Table 2). These predictors remained significant in the adjusted
model, and additionally children of unemployed mothers had signifi-
cantly lower healthcare costs over 3 years. The total healthcare costs
of children with obesity were 1.62 (95% CI 1.12-2.34, P 5 0.01)
times that of children with healthy weight, from back transformation
of the coefficient for obesity (5 exp [0.48]), but the costs for over-
weight children were very similar to children with healthy weight (P
5 0.96). After controlling for other significant predictors of health-
care costs, the additional cost of healthcare over 3 years for a child
with obesity compared with healthy weight was $825 (95% CI
$135-$2,117) for general patients and $1,332 (95% CI $174-$4,280)
for concession card holders. These costs were obtained from the
coefficients in the adjusted multivariable models (Table 2). For
example, concessional patients average 3-year healthcare costs were
$3,478 (5e(7.19 1 0.48 1 0.48) for children with obesity and $2,146
(5e(7.19 1 0.48)) for children with healthy weight, difference $1,332.
Examination of costs by type of healthcare and weight status indi-
cated that the higher total healthcare costs of children with obesity
were due mostly to the higher cost of hospitalizations (Figure 1).
The probability of using each of the different healthcare sectors by
weight classification is shown in Table 3. There were no significant
differences in use of medicines, nonhospital, and emergency care
across weight classifications. However, the odds of being hospital-
ized was significantly higher for children with obesity than children
with healthy weight (Table 3; OR 5 2.66, 95% CI 1.24-5.73, P 5
0.01). Of those with nonzero costs, the mean 3-year costs in all sec-
tors were higher for children with obesity, but these results were not
significant (Table 4).
Examination of the four most common primary diagnosis codes for
hospitalizations (which accounted for 67% (94/140) of all admissions
over 3 years) suggests compared with healthy weight, children with
obesity were more likely to be hospitalized for: diseases and disorders
of the ear, nose, mouth and throat, respiratory disorders, digestive sys-
tem disorders, and musculoskeletal conditions (Table 5).
Discussion
Our study found that obesity in preschool children, aged between 2
and �5 years, was associated with significantly higher contempora-
neous healthcare expenditure. Over the 3-year period of the study,
total healthcare costs of children with obesity were 1.62 (95% CI
1.12-2.36) times that of children with healthy weight. However,
healthcare costs of overweight children were very similar to those of
children with healthy weight. After adjustment for significant mater-
nal and socioeconomic characteristics, the excess healthcare costs
associated with obesity were $825 (general patients) and $1,438
(concession patients) over 3 years.
The probability of using prescription medicines, nonhospital, and
emergency services was not associated with weight status, but young
children with obesity were significantly more likely to be hospital-
ized than their healthy weight counterparts (OR 5 2.66 95% CI
1.24-5.73, P 5 0.01). For those with hospitalizations, the mean costs
per child of hospital care were similar across all weight status
groups. Hence it appears the higher total healthcare costs during
early childhood are driven mainly by greater likelihood of hospitali-
zation among children with obesity, rather than higher cost of hospi-
tal treatment.
While a number of studies in older school-age children have
reported higher hospital costs (11), nonhospital costs (12), and
higher medication use (28) in children with overweight or obesity
(12), our study is the first to show that excess healthcare costs dur-
ing very early childhood are associated with obesity. Our results are
very similar to findings in adult populations in which many studies
have found higher healthcare costs associated with obesity but not
overweight status (29,30). Our finding that higher healthcare costs
were associated with concession status is expected, as these families

 have lower co-payment thresholds for medicines, GP, and specialist
consultations: thus the government as the healthcare funder pays for
a greater proportion of their healthcare. The significant effects of
mother’s employment suggest those who are unemployed may have
difficulty accessing or cannot afford more healthcare for their chil-
dren, while those with “home duties” may have more opportunity to
interact with healthcare system. Factors found to be significant pre-
dictors of healthcare use in other studies such as child sex, language
spoken at home, and maternal education were not significant in this
study, possibly due to the relatively small sample size, but the direc-
tion of the coefficients was consistent with existing literature.
The analysis of reasons for hospitalization, although not powered for
rigorous statistically analysis does shed some light on the theoretical
pathways through which obesity in children under 5 years could impact
on higher rates of hospitalization. Our findings are consistent with the
known increased prevalence of the following disorders in young chil-
dren with obesity: obstructive sleep apnea (31), which may necessitate
adenotonsillectomy;
asthma,
airways
obstruction,
and
asthma-like
symptoms; and fractures, sprains, and musculoskeletal pain (32).
The strengths of the study include the use of measured height and
weight rather than self-reported at three separate time points and the
use of BMI z-score for age in the calculation of weight status.

 Another major strength of our study is we have captured all forms of
healthcare utilization of participants, including medicines, primary,
secondary, hospital, and emergency care. Healthcare utilization was
derived from participant-level data linkage; hence our healthcare cost
data are comprehensive and reliable and do not suffer from attrition
or bias. While this is a relatively small study, the linked healthcare
data form a very rich data set with over 11,000 records in 3 years.
Other strengths of our analysis are that we were able to control for
many factors found in previous studies to be associated with health-
care costs, such as birth weight, breastfeeding status (33), and mater-
nal and household sociodemographic characteristics.
Our preschool cohort was drawn from a low-socioeconomic region
of Sydney, and while the study sample also included high-income
and university-educated parents, our results are not necessarily gen-
eralizable to the wider population of preschool children in Australia.
A final limitation is only hospitalizations and emergency presenta-
tions within NSW were captured; these could be underestimated if
participants receive treatment in different states of Australia.
The economic benefit of early obesity prevention programs has pre-
viously only acknowledged later savings in healthcare costs resulting
from reduced chronic disease in later life. Indeed, modeled eco-
nomic evaluations of interventions to prevent obesity in children
generally only estimate long-term savings in direct healthcare costs
attributable to reducing chronic disease in adulthood (34). Our
results are important for healthcare funders and policy makers
because interventions to prevent obesity in early childhood may
have short-term benefits in reducing healthcare expenditure as well

 adulthood. The immediate economic consequences of obesity among
preschool-aged children may be much greater than previously
acknowledged, which adds weight to targeting obesity prevention
initiatives in the early years. Finally, these results may be used in
health economic modeling of obesity interventions delivered in early
childhood, by providing estimates of direct healthcare costs associ-
ated with obesity, overweight, and healthy weight.
Future research should be conducted in other countries and health-
care settings in order to confirm these results. Large longitudinal
studies may further elucidate the reasons for higher hospitalization
rates among children with obesity. Preschool-aged children have
been under-represented in obesity prevention and treatment pro-
grams (35), yet there is evidence that treatment of obesity is more
successful in preschoolers than older children (35). As noted by
Kleinert and Horton (36,37), preventing child obesity is key to
achieving healthy lives in adulthood and reversing obesity preva-
lence. For any successful intervention among 2- to 5-year-olds, the
implication is that for every child avoiding obesity, there are likely
to be immediate savings in direct healthcare costs. We suggest that
preventing obesity in the very early childhood years may be a cost-
effective way to tackle the obesity crisis, improve the nation’s
health, and reduce the economic burden of obesity.O
