In Brief
The production of adenosine via CD39
and CD73 ectoenzymes participates in an
immunosuppressive tumor
microenvironment. Perrot et al. generated
two antibodies, IPH5201 and IPH5301,
targeting human CD39 and CD73,
respectively. In vitro and in vivo data
support the use of anti-CD39 and anti-
CD73 mAbs in combination cancer
therapies.

SUMMARY
Immune checkpoint inhibitors have revolutionized
cancer treatment. However, many cancers are resis-
tant to ICIs, and the targeting of additional inhibitory
signals is crucial for limiting tumor evasion. The pro-
duction of adenosine via the sequential activity of
CD39 and CD73 ectoenzymes participates to the
generation of an immunosuppressive tumor micro-
environment. In order to disrupt the adenosine
pathway, we generated two antibodies, IPH5201
and IPH5301, targeting human membrane-associ-
ated and soluble forms of CD39 and CD73, respec-
tively, and efficiently blocking the hydrolysis of
immunogenic ATP into immunosuppressive adeno-
sine. These antibodies promoted antitumor immunity
by stimulating dendritic cells and macrophages and
by restoring the activation of T cells isolated from
cancer patients. In a human CD39 knockin mouse
preclinical model, IPH5201 increased the anti-tumor
activity of the ATP-inducing chemotherapeutic drug
oxaliplatin. These results support the use of anti-
CD39 and anti-CD73 monoclonal antibodies and
their combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors
and chemotherapies in cancer.
INTRODUCTION
Over the last decade, the focus of cancer treatment has shifted
from the tumor to the host, with the development of various
forms of immune-based therapies that mobilize the immune sys-
tem to promote or restore an effective antitumor immune
response (Okazaki et al., 2013; Palucka and Coussens, 2016;
Sharma and Allison, 2015a, 2015b). Unprecedented improve-
ments in tumor control have been achieved with therapeutic
blocking antibodies that release immune inhibitory ‘‘check-
points’’ (immune checkpoint inhibitors [ICIs]). However, such
treatments often yield sustained benefits, but strong responses
are observed in only a minority of treated patients, whereas
resistance to ICIs is observed in a substantial fraction of patients.
Major efforts are therefore being made to identify new targets
that activate, unleash, or enhance antitumor immune responses.
In this context the targeting of the immunosuppressive tumor
microenvironment (TME) may be of interest.
Cancer immune evasion largely involves the generation of
high amounts of immunosuppressive adenosine (Ado) within
the tumor environment. Purinergic signaling is involved in
inflammation and cancer and plays a key role in modulating
cell migration, proliferation, and death (de Andrade Mello
et al., 2017). ATP and Ado released into the TME are among
the most potent modulators of both tumor cell and immune
responses. Apoptotic cells release ATP, which acts as a
major signal, recruiting phagocytes and essential for the

 immunogenicity of cancer-cell death (Silva-Vilches et al., 2018).
ATP binds to type 2 purinergic/pyrimidinergic P2X and P2Y re-
ceptors and promotes dendritic cell (DC) maturation for antitu-
moral T cell priming. ATP also inhibits the proliferation of tumor
cells, but not of healthy cells, and promotes the death of cancer
cells. By contrast, Ado attenuates the immune response by
suppressing effector cell function and stabilizing immunosup-
pressive regulatory T cells based on their expression of Ado
A2x receptors. Ado inhibits dendritic cell activation, Th1/Th2
cytokine production, T cell proliferation and activation, natural
killer (NK)-cell activation, maturation, and cytotoxicity, and it en-
hances the suppressive functions of Tregs, Tr1 cells, and mac-
rophages (de Andrade Mello et al., 2017). ATP and Ado local
concentrations are tightly controlled by several ectonucleoti-
dases, including CD39 (ectonucleoside triphosphate diphos-
phohydrolase 1, E-NTPDase1) and CD73 (ecto-50-nucleotidase,
Ecto50NTase), expressed by cancer cells, immune cells, and the
vasculature. CD39 is a plasma-membrane-bound enzyme that
cleaves ATP and ADP down into AMP. AMP is converted into
Ado by CD73 on the cell surface. This sequential activity of
the CD39/CD73 pathway scavenges extracellular ATP and gen-
erates immunosuppressive Ado in the TME.
Early preclinical studies showed that CD39-deficient mice
were resistant to tumor metastases in the B16F10 mouse model
of melanoma and the MC-38 mouse model of colorectal cancer
(Sun et al., 2010). CD39 expression on tumor and endothelial
cells promotes angiogenesis and metastatic tumor spread,
whereas CD39 expression on Tregs is crucial for suppressing
NK cell antitumor activity (Jackson et al., 2007; Sun et al.,
2013). CD39 overexpression in tumor-bearing mice increases
the liver metastasis of MC-26 colorectal tumors in mice (K€
unzli
et al., 2011), whereas pharmacological blockade of CD39 and
other hydrolases such as E-NTPDase 2 and 3 with POM1 in-
creases antitumor immunity and decreases metastatic spread
in several tumor models (Sun et al., 2013). Furthermore, CD39
blockade enhances the immune cell effector response to human
ovarian cancer cell lines and follicular lymphoma cells in vitro and
promotes the survival of non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice in pa-
tient-derived sarcoma models (Ha
¨ usler et al., 2014; Hayes
et al., 2015; Hilchey et al., 2009). Thus, blocking CD39 activity
may be an effective approach to limit the hydrolysis of immuno-
genic ATP and prevent the accumulation of immunosuppressive
Ado. One anti-CD39 monoclonal antibody (mAb), BY40, has
been generated and reported to block the activity of the mem-
brane-associated, but not soluble, human CD39 enzyme (Niko-
lova et al., 2011), but its clinical efficacy has still not been
evaluated.
Several preclinical studies have shown that host CD73 defi-
ciency delays tumor growth in multiple models of syngeneic
transplantable tumors. CD73-deficient mice are also resistant
to lung metastasis after the intravenous injection of melanoma
and prostate cancer cells (Stagg et al., 2011, 2012). Many ap-
proaches using antibodies against CD73 or inhibitors have
shown large antitumor and anti-metastatic effects in several pre-
clinical models (Antonioli et al., 2016, 2017). Given these prom-
ising results, four mAbs, MEDI9447, BMS986179, SRF373
(also known as NZV930), and CPI-006 (also known as CPX-
006), inhibiting CD73 activity and/or inducing CD73 down mod-
ulation are currently under investigation in early-phase clinical
trials.
We show here that CD39 deficiency enhances the benefits
from combined cancer therapies in preclinical mouse solid tumor
models of melanoma and fibrosarcoma. We report the genera-
tion and characterization of two blocking antibodies against hu-
man CD39 and CD73, referred to as IPH5201 and IPH5301,
respectively. The anti-CD39 mAb IPH5201 blocked ATP hydroly-
sis by both membrane and soluble CD39, thereby promoting DC
maturation and macrophage activation, whereas the anti-CD73
mAb IPH5301 blocked the degradation of AMP into immunosup-
pressive Ado and displays different functional characteristics
over currently used mAbs. Both IPH5201 and IPH5301 pre-
vented the Ado-mediated inhibition of T cells purified from pa-
tients with breast cancer or melanoma. The IPH5201 efficiently
increased the anti-tumor activity of the ATP-inducing chemo-
therapeutic drug oxaliplatin in a mice tumor model. These data
provide the scientific rationale for the clinical development of
IPH5201 and IPH5301 and their use in innovative strategies of
cancer immunotherapy.
RESULTS
CD39 Disruption Improves Antitumor Immunity
The tumor microenvironment can attenuate antitumor immunity
by generating purinergic mediators. We investigated this phe-
nomenon by monitoring the growth, in a mouse model of mela-
noma, of subcutaneously injected B16F10 cells in wild-type
(WT) and CD39-deficient mice. B16F10 tumor growth was
delayed and survival was prolonged in CD39-deficient as
compared to WT animals (Figure 1A). The B16F10 melanoma
cells do not express the CD39 ectonucleotidase per se even after
engraftment in mice (Allard et al., 2014). We monitored the
ATPase activity and the generation of AMP from added ATP
within cells isolated from the tumor or the spleen of WT mice.
AMP levels were lower in cells isolated from CD39-deficient
mice (Figure S1A) and in the presence of ARL-67156, a chemical
inhibitor of CD39 (data not shown), indicating that CD39 is the
major enzyme involved in the ATP degradation by B16F10 tumor
and spleen beds.
We next investigated CD39 expression in B16F10 tumor tis-
sues. An average of 72.5% (45.3%–90.7%) of the CD39+ cells
were CD45+ (Figure S1B), while engrafted B16F10 tumor cells
did not express CD39 endogenously (Figure S1C). In contrast,
engrafted B16F10 express CD73 that could reduce tumor
growth control in CD39 knockout (KO) mice as AMP CD73 sub-
strate can be generated independently of CD39 through other
enzymes such as NPP1 or CD38. We further characterized im-
mune cell infiltration and their expression of CD39 over time.
Immune cell infiltrate was subjected to modifications from day
8 until day 21 post B16F10 grafting, characterized by an inver-
sion of the lymphoid and myeloid frequencies between day 8
and day 21 (Figure S1D, left panel) and by a progressive increase
of CD39+ cells with tumor growth evolution (Figure S1D,
right panel). The myeloid-derived suppressive cells (MDSCs),
DCs, and macrophages that naturally expressed CD39 repre-
sented about 35% of the immune infiltrate at day 8 and 70%
at day 21 (Figure S1D, left panel). At that time, they accounted

 for �90% of the CD39 expressing cells (Figure S1D, right panel).
Tumor progression was also associated with increased intensity
of CD39 expression on myeloid cells (not shown). Thus, the
ATPase activity in the microenvironment of B16F10 tumors
was provided mostly by CD39-expressing myeloid cells. The tu-
mor infiltrate monitored in CD39-deficient animals was similar to
that observed in WT mice, indicating that CD39 expression had
no impact on the composition of the infiltrate (Figure S1E).
We then investigated the effects of host CD39 deficiency on
the effector functions of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs).
Using splenic T cells as control, we compared the cytokine
profiles after ex vivo stimulation of CD8+ (Figure 1B) and
CD4+ (Figure 1C) TILs isolated from B16F10 tumors devel-
oping in WT or CD39-deficient mice. Interestingly, both CD8+
and CD4+ TILs from CD39-deficient mice produced more inter-
feron (IFN)-g than TILs from WT mice upon treatment with anti-
CD3/anti-CD28 antibodies, which stimulate the T cell receptor,
and after phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-ionomycin
stimulation, which bypasses the T cell membrane receptor
complex. Thus, CD39 expression promotes tumor growth,
and, conversely, its genetic deficiency promotes antitumor im-
munity and improves the effector activities of both CD8+ and
CD4+ TILs.
TILs Express Both CD39 and PD-1
In the same B16F10 model, we further analyzed expression of
CD39 and PD-1 exhaustion markers at the surface of the T cell
populations infiltrating the tumor bed (Blank and Mackensen,
2007; Canale et al., 2018; Gupta et al., 2015a; Simoni et al.,
2018). In the tumor bed, PD-1 and CD39 were expressed by
both CD8+ and CD4+ TILs, and the frequency of CD39/PD-1 dou-
ble positive infiltrating CD8+ T cells was significantly increased
as compared to their splenic counterparts for which the expres-
sion was barely detectable (Figure S1F, upper panels). Further-
more, the proportion of CD39+ cells was higher in the exhausted
PD-1-expressing CD8+ TILs than in the PD-1� T cell populations
(Figure S1F, lower left panel). In this model, PD-1+CD39+ double-
positive TILs expressed higher levels of PD-1 and CD39 than
cells positive for only CD39 (Figure S1F, lower middle panel) or
PD-1 (Figure S1F, lower right panel), as previously reported
(Canale et al., 2018). We extended these observations to CD4+
TILs isolated from the mouse MC38 colorectal and MCA205
fibrosarcoma tumor models (data not shown). The co-expres-
sion of CD39 and PD-1 was thus a common feature of tumor-
infiltrating CD8+ and CD4+ T cells.
We then monitored CD39 and PD-1 expression at the surface
of tumors from patients, assessing the physiological relevance of
our observations in mice. We first analyzed the expression of
CD39 and PD-1 in human melanoma tumors by immunohisto-
chemistry. CD39 was expressed by both immune and endothe-
lial cells from the TME and by the tumor cells themselves (data
not shown), as previously reported (Bastid et al., 2015). By
contrast, PD-1 expression was restricted to immune cells (data
not shown). Immunofluorescence staining of tissue sections
showed that some tumor-infiltrating immune cells co-expressed
CD39 and PD-1 (Figure S1G). We confirmed the presence of
CD8+ TILs co-expressing CD39 and PD-1 by flow cytometry
on freshly dissociated stage IV melanoma tumors (Table S1). In
contrast,
circulating
peripheral
blood
mononuclear
cells
(PBMCs) were low for these markers (Figure S1H, left panel).
We confirmed these observations on another type of cancer,
the squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN)
(Table S2). The frequencies of CD39+ PD-1+ T cells were higher
in tumor samples from SCCHN patients than in periphery (Fig-
ure S1I, left panel). As in mouse tumor models, the frequency
of CD39+ cells was higher in the PD-1+ than in the PD-1� sub-
population of TILs (Figures S1H and S1I, middle and left panels).
We extended these observation to CD4+ T cells for both cancer
indications. Overall, these results point out in different tumor
models the specific co-expression of CD39 and PD-1 by CD8+
and CD4+ T cells infiltrating the tumor bed.
CD39 Disruption Enhances Anticancer Combination
Therapies
As CD39 and PD-1 were co-expressed by large numbers of TILs
in mouse tumor models and on human tumor samples, we hy-
pothesized that targeting these two distinct inhibitory pathways
together would improve antitumor immunity. We tested this hy-
pothesis by treating B16F10 melanoma-bearing WT and CD39-
deficient mice with a rat IgG2a anti-PD-1 mAb (Figures 1D and
S2A). The anti-PD-1 monotherapy did not affect B16F10 mela-
noma tumor growth in WT mice (Figure S2A). However, in
CD39-deficient mice, anti-PD-1 treatment delayed tumor growth
and resulted in tumor control in 20% of tumor-bearing mice,
which remained tumor free (Figure 1D). Similar results were
obtained with the anti-CTLA-4 mAb treatment, with 20% of the

 B16F10-engrafted CD39-deficient mice cured by treatment,
whereas only 5% of WT mice survived (Figure S2B). Thus, cancer
treatments with ICIs were more potent when the CD39-related
Ado pathway was silenced.
We further investigated the role of CD39 in the MCA205 fibro-
sarcoma model to challenge our findings obtained with B16F10
melanoma cells. CD39 deficiency had little effect on the control
of MCA205 tumor growth (Figure S2C). Similarly, anti-PD-1 mAb
treatment in WT mice had weak effect on tumor progression (Fig-
ure S2D, upper panel). In contrast to the B16F10 mouse mela-
noma model, treatment with anti-PD-1 mAb in CD39-deficient
mice did not lead to tumor clearance, but tumor growth was
delayed (over the treatment period) in only a few anti-PD-1
mAb-treated CD39-deficient mice (Figure S2D, lower panel).
We therefore sought to strengthen the immune response by
combining our approaches with oxaliplatin (OXA) treatment, an
immunogenic chemotherapy known to induce the release of
extracellular ATP (Kroemer et al., 2013). A single injection of
OXA in WT mice slightly improved tumor growth control and
mouse survival following the injection of MCA205 tumor cells
(Figure 1E, left panel). Tumor growth was delayed further in
tumor-bearing CD39-deficient mice treated with OXA, and only
a few mice could be cured (Figure 1E, middle panel). The combi-
nation of OXA and anti-PD-1 mAb treatments in WT mice
improved tumor growth control, and complete tumor regres-
sions were observed in more than 65% of tumor-bearing mice.
The combination of OXA and anti-PD-1 mAb treatments in
CD39-deficient mice significantly improved treatments and
cured almost all the tumor-bearing mice, with close to 90%
of the mice surviving the grafting of MCA205 tumors (Fig-
ure 1E, right panel). The combination therapy acted principally
through CD8+ T cells, with the help of CD4+ T cells but not
NK cells, as the injection of depleting anti-CD8b and anti-
CD4 mAbs impaired survival, whereas antibodies directed
against NK1.1 did not (Figure 1F). Tumor-bearing WT and
CD39-deficent mice cured by combination therapies developed
a long-term anti-tumor immune memory, as demonstrated by
tumor re-challenge experiments (data not shown). Thus, CD39
deficiency increased the efficacy of combined ICIs and chemo-
therapy treatments, providing the rationale to evaluate whether
the blockade of CD39 would increase treatment efficacy in can-
cer patients.
IPH5201 Antibody Blocks the Activities of Both
Membrane-Bound and Soluble CD39
We generated anti-human CD39 antibodies and assessed their
ability to block ATPase activity. We identified an anti-human
CD39 mAb, IPH5201, which specifically recognized recombinant
human CD39 (ENTPD1) and not CD39L1 (ENTPD2), CD39L2
(ENTPD6), CD39L3 (ENTPD3), or CD39L4 (ENTPD5) (Fig-
ure S3A). IPH5201 and the previously described BY40 had
similar affinities for CD39, as shown by flow cytometry (Fig-
ure S3B) and surface plasmon resonance (SPR; Figure S3C)
analyses. Neither IPH5201 nor BY40 downregulated mem-
brane-associated CD39 (Figure S3D).
We further assessed the ectonucleotidase-blocking activity of
IPH5201 relative to that of BY40. WIL2-NS and Mino CD39-ex-
pressing tumor cells (Figure S3E) were incubated with ATP in
the presence or absence of the two anti-CD39 mAbs, and resid-
ual ATP levels in the supernatant were determined (Figures 2A
and S3F, respectively). Both model cell lines efficiently hydro-
lyzed extracellular ATP, since no to low residual ATP could be
detected in the absence of mAb or in the presence of an isotype
control. By contrast, we observed a dose-dependent inhibition
of ATP hydrolysis when cells were incubated with IPH5201.
ATP hydrolysis was also decreased by the addition of BY40
mAb to the culture medium but to a lesser extent than with
IPH5201 (Figures 2A and S2F). We also evaluated the efficacy
of IPH5201 for blocking the soluble form of CD39 protein. Inter-
estingly, IPH5201 efficiently blocked the enzyme activity of the
soluble CD39 protein present in the supernatant of WIL2-NS
and Mino cell lines, whereas BY40 did not (Figures 2B and
S3G). We confirmed the ability of IPH5201, but not of BY40, to
block CD39 enzyme activity on soluble recombinant CD39 pro-
tein (Figure 2C). Importantly, IPH5201 also blocked the CD39
enzymatic activity from primary tumor biopsies of melanoma,
sarcoma, and ovarian cancer patients (Figure 2D; Table S3).
Thus, IPH5201 anti-CD39 mAb blocked the ATPase activity of
CD39 more effectively than BY40 by inhibiting both membrane
and soluble forms of the enzyme.
Blocking CD39 Ectonucleotidase Activity Preserves
Immunogenic ATP and Limits Immunosuppressive
Adenosine Production
We hypothesized that the inhibition of ATP hydrolysis, leading to
ATP accumulation, would favor the maturation and activation of
DCs, as suggested in a previous study (Kroemer et al., 2013).
We therefore treated monocyte-derived DCs (MoDCs) with a
dose-range of ATP in the presence or not of IPH5201, BY40,
or a control mAb and assessed phenotypic changes and the
stimulatory potential of conditioned MoDCs. The expression of
HLA-DR and CD83 were increased by ATP in presence of
IPH5201 but not BY40 or control mAb (Figure 2E, middle
panels). The phenotypic maturation of MoDCs observed in the
presence of IPH5201 was also functionally associated with
improvement in the stimulation of allogeneic CD4 T cells in a
mixed lymphocyte reaction assay (Figure 2E, right panel).
Finally, we evaluated the effect of CD39 blockade on the inflam-
masome pathway by assessing interleukin 1b (IL-1b) secretion
from in vitro-derived M1 macrophages stimulated with lipopoly-
saccharide (LPS). IPH5201 efficiently promoted LPS-induced
IL-1b production, whereas BY40 did not (Figure 2F, right panel).
As hypothesized, IPH5201 enhanced the phenotypic maturation
and the activation of DCs and macrophages by inhibiting ATP
hydrolysis.
We then investigated the efficacy of IPH5201 anti-CD39 mAb
for preventing the immunosuppressive effects of Ado. The prolif-
eration of CD4+ and CD8+ T cell preparations enriched from hu-
man peripheral blood was strongly impaired after anti-CD3/
CD28 stimulation if ATP was added to the assay. IPH5201 effi-
ciently restored T cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner
to the levels observed in the absence of ATP addition, whereas
BY40 was much less effective in restoring T cell proliferation
(Figure 2G).
Thus, the blocking anti-CD39 mAb IPH5201 preserved extra-
cellular ATP, thereby promoting the activation of DCs and

suppressive effect on T cells.
IPH5201 Blocks CD39 in Human CD39 Preclinical Mouse
Model and Promotes Antitumor Immunity
We generated human CD39 knockin mice by replacing the
mouse CD39 with human CD39 protein using a KO/knockin
(KI) molecular biology strategy. In this model, the human
CD39 expression
phenocopied
the expression
of mouse
CD39 (Figure S5A). Ex vivo, splenocytes from human CD39 KI
mice left untreated or treated with a control mAb hydrolyzed
extracellular ATP as well as cells from WT mice (Figure 3A,
left panel). Murinized IPH5201 (IPH5201 with a mouse Fc silent
IgG1 isotype, referred to as moIPH5201 thereafter) mouse
treatment prevented ex vivo ATP hydrolysis by human CD39
KI cells, and ATP levels were similar to those measured for
CD39-deficient cells. Similar results were obtained with spleen
dissociation supernatants (Figure 3A, right panel). We further
showed that in vivo moIPH5201 did not deplete or modify the
relative number of the immune cell subsets, including CD39-ex-
pressing cells such as Treg or myeloid cells (Figure S5B).
Collectively, these results showed that moIPH5201 mice treat-
ment efficiently inhibits membrane and soluble human CD39
enzyme expressed by human CD39 KI primary immune mouse
cells ex vivo without mediating CD39-expressing immune cell
depletion in vivo.
We then assessed the antitumor potency of moIPH5201 in
preclinical human CD39 KI mouse model grafted with MCA205
tumors (Figure 3B). As observed in CD39-deficient mice,
moIPH5201 did not rescue mice from death when used as a sin-
gle agent when compared to control group. By contrast, with
sub-optimal regimen, chemotherapy rescued around 30% of
tumor-bearing mice from death, as shown by comparison with
untreated mice. A combination of IPH5201 and OXA had a syn-
ergistic effect, improving the control of tumor growth and
rescuing close to 60% of the mice from death (Figure 3B). These
results confirmed our previous findings showing that the
blockade of the adenosinergic pathway, either by the genetic
deletion of CD39 or by its blockade with moIPH5201, combined
with immunogenic chemotherapy had therapeutic anti-tumor
effects in preclinical mouse model.
Targeting the CD73 Enzyme Limits Immunosuppressive
Adenosine Production
CD73 degrades AMP into immunosuppressive Ado. Given the
potential in vivo redundancy of CD39 with AMP-generating en-
zymes such as CD38 molecule, targeting CD73 in addition to
CD39 would further limit the Ado production. We thus decided
to generate monoclonal antibodies blocking human CD73 enzy-
matic activity to complete our strategy of inhibition of the Ado
pathway in patients. We selected an anti-human CD73 mAb,
IPH5301. We then compared IPH5301 with two benchmarked
mAbs, MEDI9447 (MedImmune) and CD73.4 (Bristol-Myers
Squibb). These three mAbs had similar affinities for A375 and
MDA-MB-231 CD73-expressing tumor cell lines, with similar
half maximal effective concentration (EC50) values (Figure S5A).
SPR analysis showed that intact IPH5301 mAb and IPH5301
Fab had a KD on recombinant CD73 similar to that of bench-
marked mAbs and Fabs, respectively (Figure S5B).
We further evaluated the ability of IPH5301 to block mem-
brane-associated and soluble CD73 enzyme activity. IPH5301
strongly inhibited AMP hydrolysis at the membrane of A375 (Fig-
ure 4A) and MDA-MB-231 (Figure S5C) cancer cells and did so
more effectively than MEDI9447 and CD73.4 benchmarked
mAbs. IPH5301 also blocked the activity of the soluble CD73
enzyme more effectively than the other two anti-CD73 mAbs,
especially at high Ab concentration (Figures 4B and S5D). Finally,
unlike MEDI9447 and CD73.4, IPH5301 did not downregulate
CD73 levels at the membrane of A375 (Figure 4C) and MDA-
MB-231 (Figure S5E) cell lines.
We assessed the ability of IPH5301 to reverse the immuno-
suppressive effect of AMP on T cells. Exogenous AMP strongly
inhibited both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell proliferation (Figure 4D,
open versus closed squares). IPH5301 blocked this inhibition
in a dose-dependent manner and appeared to be more effi-
cient than the other two anti-CD73 mAbs with both subsets
Figure 2. IPH5201 Efficiently Blocks CD39 Enzyme Activity and Promotes the Activation of T Cells, DCs, and Macrophages in the Presence
of ATP
(A–C) The WIL2-NS human B cell line (A), WIL2-NS cell supernatant (B), or recombinant human CD39 protein (C) was incubated with ATP (open square) in the
presence or absence of anti-CD39 IPH5201 or BY40 mAbs or control mAb over a range of doses or at a saturating dose (10 mg/ml). ATP was incubated in TBS
buffer (A and C) or in culture medium (B) with no source of CD39 as a control (closed square). After 1 h (A), 2 h (B), or 30 min (C), the remaining ATP was quantified in
the cell supernatant. Percentage of CD39 inhibition was plotted as the pooled results of 11 and 7 independent experiments for membrane and soluble CD39,
respectively. Non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test followed by a Dunn’s multiple comparisons test. Data with recombinant human CD39 protein are representative
of four experiments.
(D) Cells isolated from melanoma, sarcoma, and ovarian tumors were incubated with ATP in the presence of anti-CD39 IPH5201 or BY40 mAbs or control mAb at
saturating dose (10 mg/ml). After 30 min AMP generated was quantified in cell supernatant. Percentages of inhibition of AMP generation by IPH5201 and BY40 mAbs
relative to control mAb as the pooled results of 6, 1, and 2 experiments with melanoma, sarcoma, and ovarian tumors, respectively, are indicated. Regarding ovarian
samples, results were obtained from two biopsies of the same patient (see STAR Methods section). Non-parametric Mann-Whitney test; **p < 0.01.
(E) Monocytes were allowed to differentiate into dendritic cells (MoDCs), which were then incubated with anti-CD39 or control mAbs and stimulated with a range
of ATP doses. The expression of HLA-DR and CD83 was assessed by flow cytometry. Median fluorescence of HLA-DR-positive cells and percentage of cells
expressing CD83 are shown according to ATP dose (E, middle panels). ATP-stimulated MoDCs were extensively washed and cultured with allogeneic CD4+
T cells. T cell proliferation was measured (E, right panel).
(F) Monocytes were allowed to differentiate into M1-like macrophages and were then incubated with a fixed dose of anti-CD39 or control mAbs and stimulated
with LPS and then with a range of ATP doses. IL-1b production was determined according to the dose of ATP (F, right panel). Data are representative of four
experiments in (E) and (F).
(G) Human lymphocyte-enriched peripheral blood cell preparations were activated with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 antibody-coated beads in the presence of ATP and a
range of doses of anti-CD39 or control mAbs. T cell proliferation was assessed by flow cytometry. Data are representative of at least 3 experiments.

 (Figures 4D and 4E). We then investigated whether IPH5301
could block the Ado-mediated suppression of T cell proliferation
in a MLR model (Figure 4F). MoDCs induced a potent prolifera-
tion of allogeneic T cells that was inhibited by the addition of
ATP (Figure 4F, middle panel). IPH5301 blocked the ATP-medi-
ated T cell suppression, in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 4F,
right panel). Overall, these results indicate that blocking CD73
enzyme activity with IPH5301 efficiently inhibits ATP-derived
AMP hydrolysis into Ado, thereby promoting T cell proliferation,
with a different mechanism of action compared to benchmarked
mAbs as it does not induce internalization, while being more
active in several tests.

 IPH5301 Blocks Enzyme Activity by Constraining CD73
in an Intermediate Conformation
To get more insight into the mechanism of action of the IPH5301
blocking mAb, we dissected its association with CD73 using two
complementary approaches. First, the negative staining of the
CD73-IPH5301 complex analyzed by electron microscopy re-
vealed that the intact IPH5301 mAb interacts with the N-terminal
domains of the CD73 dimers mainly in a 1:1 stoichiometry (i.e.,
1 IPH5301 mAb for 1 CD73 dimer; Figure 5A). This obser-
vation was confirmed by the electronic microscopy image of a

Figure 4. IPH5301 Blocks Membrane-Associated and Soluble Forms of CD73 Enzyme and Attenuates AMP-Mediated T Cell Suppression
(A and B) A375 human melanoma cells (A) or A375 cell supernatant (B) were incubated with AMP in the presence or absence of anti-CD73 (IPH5301, MEDI9447,
and CD73.4) or control mAbs over a range of doses or at the saturating concentration of 10 mg/ml. After 1 h (A) or 2 h (B) of incubation, the AMP remaining in the cell
supernatant was quantified. Percentage of enzyme inhibition was plotted as the pooled results of at least four experiments. Non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test
followed by a Dunn’s multiple comparisons test. Data using A375 cell supernatant are representative of 4 experiments.
(C) Ability of anti-CD73 mAbs to induce CD73 downregulation was assessed by incubating A375 cells with 10 mg/ml anti-CD73 mAbs at 37�C. CD73 expression
analyzed by flow cytometry was standardized relative to T0 expression and plotted against time. Data are representative of 3 experiments.
(D) Experiment similar to that in Figure 2G except that suppression was induced by AMP rather than ATP. Data are representative of at least 8 independent
experiments.
(E) The maximal potency of the mAbs to reverse ATP-mediated T cell suppression was determined at a concentration of 10 mg/ml anti-CD73 or control mAbs. Data
are a pool of at least eight independent experiments. Non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test followed by a Dunn’s multiple comparisons test.
(F) MoDCs were cultured with allogeneic CD4+ T cells in the presence or absence of range of doses of anti-CD73 IPH5301 mAb and an immunosuppressive dose
of ATP (100 mM). T cell proliferation was evaluated by flow cytometry. Percentages of T cells proliferating in the presence or absence of ATP (middle panel, two
independent experiments) and in the presence of increasing doses of IPH5301 mAb (right panel) are shown.

 complete field of particles and a SDS-PAGE analysis of IPH5301
and CD73 ectodomain main complexes collected after gel filtra-
tion using a Superose 6 column (Figures S6A–S6C). Second, we
determined the crystal structure of IPH5301 Fab in complex with
the ectodomain of CD73 to 2.78 A
˚ resolution (PDB: 6HXW). There
is a zero occupancy for the constant domains (both light and
heavy chains) of one IPH5301 Fab as it was not stabilized in
the crystal packing. However, the variable chains of this Fab is
well defined in the electron density map, indicating that it was
present in the crystal (Figure S6D). Thus, we set the occupancy
to zero for the corresponding atoms (816 atoms out of a total of
14,641). This analysis indicated that IPH5301 Fab interacts with
the catalytically active closed state of CD73 (Figure 5B; Table
S4). Indeed, previous structural studies of CD73 have shown
that its enzymatic activity requires extensive N-terminal domain
rotation defining open (inactive) and closed (active) states of the
enzyme (Knapp et al., 2012). Taken into consideration the 1:1
stoichiometry between an intact IPH5301 mAb and a CD73
dimer, it is anticipated that steric hindrance would make it un-
likely that the intact mAb could bind to CD73 open conformers
(Figure 5C, left panel). Our data thus support a model for the
mode of action of IPH5301, as the intact mAb constrains CD73
in an intermediate state in which AMP could not be hydrolyzed
(Figure 5C, right panel). This model is further supported by the
fact that monovalent IPH5301 Fab failed to block membrane-
associated CD73 enzymatic activity (Figure S6E). Furthermore,
the IPH5301 Fab orientation on the N-terminal domain of CD73
is compatible with an intra-dimer binding mode as it is located
right on the apex of the molecule (not shown) in contrast to
Medi9447 and CD73.4 mAbs, whose epitopes are eccentric
and that are described to interact with CD73 in an inter-dimer
mode (Geoghegan et al., 2016; Larrick et al., 2016). Finally, the
absence of detectable downregulation of CD73 by IPH5301
immunoglobulin G (IgG) is consistent with intra-dimer binding,
rather than the downregulation-inducing crosslinking expected
from inter-dimer contacts.
The Combination of IPH5201 and IPH5301 Releases
ATP-Mediated Suppression of T Cells from Healthy
Donors and Cancer Patients
We have shown that TILs from cancer patients expressed a high
level of CD39 and that inhibition of the immunosuppressive Ado
pathway stimulated T cell proliferation. We next investigated
whether the IPH5201 and IPH5301 mAbs blocked the immuno-
suppressive Ado pathway in PBMCs obtained from breast
cancer patients. The addition of extracellular ATP to activated-
PBMCs reduced CD4+ and CD8+ T cell proliferation (Figures
6A and 6B). Saturating doses of either anti-CD39 or anti-CD73
mAbs, used as single agents, abolished the suppression of
CD4+ and CD8+ T cells by extracellular ATP, as shown by com-
parisons with control mAb (Figures 6A and 6B).
As previously mentioned, some membrane ATPase may
generate AMP and mediate immunosuppression through Ado
that could overcome the sole blockade of CD39. In light of these
data, we investigated whether the combination of IPH5201 and
IPH5301 could synergize to block the adenosinergic pathway.
Dose-ranges of IPH5201 and IP5301 mAbs were used to treat
PBMCs from healthy donors in combination with sub-optimal
doses of IPH5301 and IPH5201, respectively. As previously
observed (Figure 6B), saturating doses of both mAbs potently
blocked ATP-mediated T cell suppression. When used in combi-
nation at inefficient suboptimal doses, the anti-CD39/CD73
mAbs acted in synergy to abrogate suppressive effect of ATP
and promote the proliferation of T cells from healthy donors
(Figures 6C and 6D). Similar results were obtained for T cells
from breast cancer patient PBMCs (Figure 6E and Table S5).
Overall, these data suggest that the concomitant blockade of
both CD39 and CD73 immunosuppressive enzyme can limit

 Ado-mediated T cell inhibition, thereby enhancing anti-tumor
immunity.
DISCUSSION
Primary or acquired resistance to cancer immunotherapy is
common, prompting the identification of predictive markers
and the causes of resistance mechanisms to ICIs (Sharma
et al., 2017). An increase of CD39 and CD73 at the tumor bed sig-
nals an immunosuppressive environment inhibiting anti-tumor
immune responses and favoring tumor spreading. Combining
genetic and antibody-mediated approaches, we investigated
here the impact of blocking CD39 and CD73 ectoenzymes to
overcome Ado-mediated immunosuppression and reinforce
anti-tumor immunity.
Besides its well-described ATPase activity, deep phenotypic
profiling of tumor microenvironment identifies CD39-expressing
T cells as a specific cell subtype of TILs (Canale et al., 2018;
Gupta et al., 2015b; Simoni et al., 2018). We confirm here the
co-expression of CD39 and PD-1 by TILs in melanoma, fibrosar-
coma, and colon cancer preclinical mouse models as well as in
human melanoma and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma
(HNSCC) specimens. We used therapy-resistant mouse models
or inefficacious treatment regimens to assess the capacity of
CD39 blockade to modulate the immune response to chemo-
therapies and ICIs. We demonstrated an increased efficacy of
anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 treatments in CD39-deficient ani-
mals grafted with a B16-F10 melanoma cell line. Using
MCA205, a sarcoma tumor model resistant to PD-1 treatment
when used as single agent, we showed that suboptimal chemo-
therapy regimen enhanced the effects of anti-PD-1 treatment in
WT mice. These synergistic effects were improved in CD39-defi-
cient mice as the combination of both therapies rescued almost
all the mice from death. Thus, the genetic deletion of CD39 ecto-
nucleotidase in combination with other cancer treatments is
beneficial and improves anti-tumor immunity. These results rein-
force the previous demonstration that blockade of Ado genera-
tion via CD73 or its signaling through A2AR act in synergy with
anti-PD-1 or anti-CTLA-4 mAbs in preclinical studies (Allard
et al., 2013; Beavis et al., 2013; Iannone et al., 2014; Waickman
et al., 2012). Based on these data, phase I/II clinical trials evalu-
ating the blockade of CD73 or A2AR in combination with inhibi-
tors of the PD-1/PD-L1 axis are currently being conducted
(NCT02503774, NCT03611556, NCT03616886, NCT02655822,
NCT03549000, and NCT03454451).
In line with our preclinical mouse model data, we generated
an anti-CD39 mAb, IPH5201, which was found to be more
effective than the previously reported membrane CD39 blocking
mAb, BY40, as IPH5201 inhibited both the membrane-bound
and soluble forms of the enzyme. By inhibiting the degradation
of ATP, IPH5201 not only limits Ado accumulation and its immu-
nosuppressive effect on effector T cells but also efficiently pro-
motes the activation of DCs and macrophages through the
maintenance of the extracellular ATP pool. The dual effect of
IPH5201 might be most interesting for the design of combinato-
rial therapies as the efficient release and accumulation of ATP
appear to be critical for the immunogenic response after
chemotherapy treatment. Indeed, chemotherapeutic agents,
such as OXA and mitoxantrone that induce ATP release, fail to
elicit an efficient immunogenic response in CD39+ cancer cells,
due to a CD39-dependent ATP hydrolysis (Michaud et al.,
2011). In addition to the priming of the immune response, extra-
cellular ATP is also known to specifically inhibit tumor cell pro-
liferation and to promote cancer cell death (Feng et al., 2011;
White and Burnstock, 2006). The pluripotent role of ATP in elic-
iting potent anti-tumor response strengthened the interest of
blocking CD39 ATPase activity for the treatment of cancer.
Encouragingly, we confirmed the therapeutic potential of
moIPH5201 in combination with immunogenic chemotherapy,
using a human CD39 KI mouse model. Altogether, these obser-
vations paved the way to clinical trials of IPH5201 mAb in can-
cer patients.
However, there might be conditions where other enzymes
generating AMP, such as NPP1 or CD38, can compensate for
the lack of CD39 activity and lead to generation of Ado in the
tumor microenvironment. In this context, the blockade of the
adenosinergic pathway downstream of ATP hydrolysis (i.e.,
CD73, Ado receptors) is of most interest. We generated an
anti-CD73 mAb that inhibited both the membrane-bound and
soluble forms of the enzyme more effectively than benchmark
mAbs (i.e., MEDI9447 from MedImmune, BMS986179 from
Bristol-Myers Squibb), with differentiated mechanism of action.
Anti-CD73 mAbs are currently under evaluation in phase I/II
clinical trials, either alone or in combination with durvalumab,
nivolumab, or pembrolizumab and adenosine receptor (AdoR)
inhibitors, tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), and chemotherapies
for the treatment of advanced solid tumors. Preliminary data
for the combinations indicate a tolerable safety profile similar
to those for durvalumab or nivolumab monotherapies, consistent
with minor phenotypic modification observed in KO mice (Blume
et al., 2012; Sun et al., 2010). Furthermore, promising anti-tumor
efficacy was observed with both anti-CD73 mAbs in combination
with PD-(L)1 blockers, reinforcing the interest of blocking CD73
in combination with ICIs (Siu et al., 2018; Overman et al.,
(B) The percentage of T cells proliferating is shown. Results are normalized relative to the corresponding maximal proliferation conditions obtained without ATP for
each patient. T cell proliferation was plotted as the pooled results of four different patients.
(C and D) PBMCs from healthy donors were activated with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 antibody-coated beads in the presence or absence of 500 mM ATP and of the
indicated doses of IPH5201, IPH5301, or control mAbs. T cell proliferation was assessed as described previously.
(C) FACS profiles. Data are representative of 5 experiments with independent donors.
(D) The percentage proliferation of T cells is shown. The upper panel shows dose range of IPH5301 alone (red curve) or in combination with 1 mg/ml of IPH5201
(purple curve). Potency of IPH5201 at 1 mg/ml is also shown (blue symbol). The lower panel shows dose range of IPH5201 alone (blue curve) or in combination with
10�3 mg/ml of IPH5301 (purple curve). Potency of IPH5201 at 10�3 mg/ml is also shown (red symbol). Data are representative of at least five experiments with
independent donors.
(E) Experiment similar to that in (C) and (D) with PBMCs from breast cancer patients. Presented IPH5201 and IPH5301 concentrations (alone or in combination) are
10�1 mg/ml and 10�2 mg/ml, respectively. Data are representative of three experiments performed on independent human subjects.

Cell Reports 27, 2411–2425, May 21, 2019
 2018). The development of IPH5301 for clinic al use in several hu-
man cancer indications is therefore underway.
Besides the combination of inhibitors of the adenosinergic
pathway with conventional or targeted therapies and immune
checkpoint blockers, it remains to be addressed whether co-
blockade of CD39, CD73, and/or A2AR might be redundant or
not. Interestingly, the co-inhibition of CD73 and A2AR has
been shown to improve anti-tumor immune responses and limit
tumor initiation, growth, and metastasis in breast, melanoma,
and fibrosarcoma preclinical models (Young et al., 2016).
Furthermore, recent data showed that human tumor cells may
express CD38, an ectoenzyme that mediated immunosuppres-
sion through the indirect production of AMP, thus of Ado, and
favored tumor cell escape from PD-1/PD-L1 axis blockade
(Chen et al., 2018). In this context, we anticipated a synergistic
effect of CD39 and CD73 blocking antibodies to improve anti-tu-
mor immune responses. A differentiated effect of blocking CD39,
contrary to A2AR or CD73 inhibitors, is to preserve the immunos-
timulatory ATP pool. Indeed, by limiting the generation of Ado, a
major inhibitor of effector T cell and NK cell antitumor activities,
and increasing levels of extracellular ATP, an inhibitor of tumor
cell proliferation and an essential sensor molecule that attracts
antigen-presenting cells to the tumor site, we expected a clinical
benefit of the association. As a first step, we demonstrated here
that both IPH5201 and IPH5301 mAbs efficiently block ATP-
mediated inhibition of activated T cells. More importantly,
when used at sub-optimal concentrations, both antibodies act
in synergy to restore proliferation of T cells within PBMC ob-
tained from healthy donors and breast cancer patients.
In conclusion, we report here the positive impact of blocking
the CD39 and the CD73 ectoenzymes on the immune system
and the generation of two mAbs, IPH5201 and IPH5301, target-
ing the CD39 and CD73, respectively. These mAbs inhibited the
Ado pathway more effectively than the previously described
mAbs. The clinical development of IPH5201 and IPH5301 should
be beneficial for several human cancer indications, particularly if
these mAbs are used in combination with each other, with ICIs,
and with chemotherapies.

 EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Human Subjects
Fresh biopsies and matched blood from melanoma patients were obtained at the time of surgical resection under Centre Hospitalier
Re
´ gional Universitaire de Montpellier approved protocol and written informed consent from each patient. Patients’ characteristics
are summarized in Tables S1 and S3.
Peripheral blood and tumor tissues from SCCHN patients were obtained at the time of surgical resection under Institut Curie
approved protocol and written informed consent from each patient. Patients’ characteristics are summarized in Table S2.
Fresh ovary cancer and sarcoma specimens were provided by the Institut Re
´ gional du Cancer de Montpellier (BioBank #BB-
033-0059) under an approved protocol and written informed consent from each patient. Patients’ characteristics are summarized
in Table S3.
Frozen PBMC from breast cancer patients were obtained under Institut Paoli Calmette approved protocol and written informed
consent from each patient. Patients’ characteristics are summarized in Table S5.
Peripheral blood samples from healthy donors were obtained from Etablissement Francais du Sang (EFS, Marseille) under a written
consent obtained from each volunteer.
Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections from melanoma patients were provided by Prof. Sylvain Lehmann, the director
of the BB-033-00031 Biobank at the Centre Hospitalier Re
´ gional Universitaire de Montpellier.
Mice
CD39-deficient mice (C57BL/6N), generated by OREGA Biotech, were bred and kept under specific and opportunistic pathogen-free
conditions at the Charles River animal facility. C57BL/6N mice were purchased from Envigo or Charles River. For experiments, mice
were kept in specific pathogen-free conditions in the animal facilities of the Institut de Recherche sur le Cancer de Montpellier. All
procedures for animal handling and experiments were approved by the ethics committee of the local animal facility (‘‘ComEth’’)
and the institutional review board, under the authority of the regional ethics committee for animal experimentation.
Human CD39 KI mice (B6-Entpd1tm1Ciphe) were generated at UMS-CIPHE (Marseille, France) with the following strategy: briefly,
the human cDNA sequence coded by exons 2-10 were placed with the 2nd exon of the mouse CD39 gene. Chimeric germline trans-
mitting HE mice were crossed to generate HO human CD39ki mice, and further backcrossed under 6 generations with C57BL/6N
mice. Human CD39 ki mice were further bred at the CIPHE animal facility (Marseille) under specific pathogen free conditions. For
tumor experiments, female mice were used at 6 to 12 weeks of age, kept under specific and opportunistic pathogen free conditions
at Innate Pharma animal facility (Marseille). All animal experiments were performed in accordance with the rules of the Innate Pharma
ethics and animal welfare committees.
Cell lines
B16F10 and MCA205 cells were maintained in complete DMEM (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) supplemented with 10% fetal calf
serum (FCS), and 2 mg/ml gentamycin (Life Technologies). MC38 cells were grown in complete RPMI 1640 medium supplemented
with 10% FCS, 16 mM HEPES (Life Technologies) and 2 mg/ml gentamycin. WIL2-NS and Mino cell lines were maintained in RPMI
1640 medium supplemented with 10% FCS, 1% GlutaMAX and 1% Sodium Pyruvate (all from Life Technologies). A375 and MDA-
MB-231 were grown in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FCS, 1% L-Glutamine 200 mM and 1% Sodium Pyruvate (all from
Life Technologies). All cell lines were cultured at 37�C under an atmosphere containing 5% CO2. All cell lines were tested regularly for
mycoplasma contamination, and the murine cell lines used for tumor grafts were also regularly tested for rodent pathogens.
METHOD DETAILS
Antibody cloning, chimerization and purification
The cloning vector used in this study is the Selexis mammalian expression vector plasmid. mRNA of IPH5201 and IPH5301 hybrid-
omas were purified and cDNA were generated to perform PCR with pools of primers allowing the amplification of VH and VL se-
quences of mouse variable domains. The VH purified PCR products were then cloned into the SLX HUB3 vector. This vector contains
a human IgG1 sequence harboring 5 mutations that abrogate FcR binding (L234A/L235E/G237A/A330S/ P331S). The VL purified
PCR products were cloned into the SLX HuCk vector. PCR were performed on the bacterial colonies obtained after the In-Fusion
ligations and the selected positive clones were prepared as miniprep and sequenced. VH and VL plasmids were transfected in
CHO cell line according the standard nucleofection protocol (Amaxa, 4D-Nucleofector). After 7 days of culture, supernatants
were harvested and the antibodies purified onto protein-A Sepharose beads.
The VH and VL chains of the isotype control antibody were selected from an antibody that binds a toxin produced by a Mexican
Scorpio. MEDI9447 (MedImmune) and CD73.4 (Brystol Meyer Squibb) mAbs were cloned using the VH and VL chain sequences pub-
lished in #WO 2016/075099 Al and #WO 2016/081748 A3 application patents, respectively. All VH and VL sequences were chemically
synthesized. The control Ab was cloned into the SLX HUB3 (VH) and SLX HuCk (VL) vectors. MEDI9447 was cloned into the SLX
e5
Cell Reports 27, 2411–2425.e1–e9, May 21, 2019
 HUB3 (VH) and SLX HuCl (VL) vectors. CD73.4 was cloned into SLX HUG2G1 (VH) and SLX HuCk (VL) vectors. The HUG2G1 vector
contains a human IgG1 sequence harboring 2 mutations that abrogates FcR binding (A330S/ P331S) and the CH1 + Hinge region of
an IgG2 that contains a mutation in position 219 (C219S).
Flow cytometry
For immunophenotyping, cells were incubated with either mouse or human blocking buffer (Miltenyi Biotec) for 20 min at 4�C in FACs
buffer, pelleted and resuspended in appropriate antibody cocktail for 1 h at 4�C. Cells were then fixed and permeabilized with the
corresponding buffer and stained for intracellular protein detection for 1 h for human cells or overnight for mouse cells, at 4�C in
the dark. Cells were finally fixed with 1% PFA in PBS and stored until acquisition with a Fortessa or Cytoflex flow cytometer. Data
were analyzed with Flowjo 10 software.
To assess Ab-mediated CD39 or CD73 down-modulation, 105 WIL2-NS, A375 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines were distributed into
round-bottom 96W-microplates in presence of 10 mg/ml anti-CD39 (WIL2-NS) or anti-CD73 (A375, MDA-MB-231) Abs. Cells were
incubated for a time-course at 4�C and 37�C and at the different time-points, cells were recovered, washed twice in staining buffer
and incubated for 30 additional minutes with a fixed dose of the same Ab used for the time-course. Bound Abs were revealed with a
PE or APC-conjugated goat anti-human IgG Fc secondary Abs for 20 min at 4�C. Cells were then analyzed on a Fortessa flow cy-
tometer. The relative expression of CD39 and CD73 was determined using the first-time point as reference and plotted versus

5x104 B16F10 or 5x105 MC38 or 106 MCA205 cells resuspended in 100 ml of PBS were injected subcutaneously (s.c.) into 9- to
12-week-old WT or CD39-deficient female mice. Tumor growth was monitored three times per week with a caliper and mice were
killed when the tumor reached a volume of 1500 mm3. Tumor volume was calculated with the following formula: length x width x
width/2. For assessment of the therapeutic effect of oxaliplatin, MCA205-grafted mice received a single intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection
of oxaliplatin, at a dose of 10 mg/kg, on day 5. For assessment of the therapeutic effect of anti-PD-1 mAb, B16F10-grafted mice
received six injections of anti-PD-1 antibody (i.p. injection, 200 mg/mouse) or control rIgG2A antibody (i.p. injection, 200 mg/mouse),
on days 6, 9, 13, 16, 20 and 23. For assessment of the therapeutic effect of anti-CTLA-4 mAb, B16F10-grafted mice received eight
injections of anti- CTLA-4 antibody (i.p. injection, 200 mg/mouse) or control antibody (i.p. injection, 200 mg/mouse), on days 5, 8, 12,
16, 19, 23, 26 and 30. We evaluated the effect of anti-PD-1 therapy in MCA205-grafted mice, by administering eight injections of anti-
PD-1 antibody or control rIgG2A antibody on days 6, 9, 13, 16, 20, 23, 27 and 30. CD8 T cells were depleted by an injection of anti-
CD8 antibody (i.p. injections, 200 mg/mouse), and then further injections twice weekly, and the results were compared with those of
mice receiving control rIgG2b antibody (i.p. injections, 200 mg/mouse, BioXCell, BP0090) according to the same schedule. CD4
T cells were depleted by the injection of anti-CD4 mAb (i.p. injections, 200 mg/mouse, BioXCell, BP0003) on day 4 and then once
weekly, and comparisons were made with control mIgG2a antibody (i.p. injections, 200 mg/mouse, BioXCell, BP0085). NK cells
were deleted by the injection of anti-NK antibodies (i.p. injections, 200 mg/mouse, BioXCell, BP0036) on day 4 and then twice weekly,
with comparison against control mIgG2a antibody (i.p. injections, 200 mg/mouse, BioXCell, BP0085). CD8, CD4 and NK cell deple-
tions were checked by FACS analysis at the time of death of the mouse.
Human CD39 KI mice were treated with IPH5201 and control Ab (i.v. injections; 400 mg/mouse) or left untreated. 20 hours post-
injection, spleens were collected and splenocytes were isolated by mechanical dissociation. Spleen cells or the dissociation super-
natant were incubated with 20 mM ATP for 2 hours (cells) or 30 min (supernatant) at 37�C. 50 ml of supernatant of both conditions were
transferred in white well plates for the quantification of residual ATP using Cell Titer Glo assay. WT and mouse CD39 KO mice were
used as control. ATP in absence or presence of cells or supernatants were plotted on graphs using GraphPad Prism software.
In order to assess anti-tumor effect of IPH5201 and oxaliplatin in vivo, human CD39 KI mice were i.p. grafted with 1x106 MCA205
cells in PBS (100 ml/mouse). Then, the mice received 8 i.v. injections of IPH5201 or control Ab (400 mg/mouse for the 1st injection,
200 mg/mouse all others; day 4, 7, 11, 14, 19, 22, 26, 29) and 2 i.p. injections of Oxaliplatin (10 mg/kg; day 5 and 12 or 14). Tumor
growth was monitored three times a week and mice were euthanized when the tumor reached a volume of 2000 mm3 or in case
of tumor necrosis. Tumor volume was calculated as previously mentioned. Tumor volume or percent of survival versus time were
plotted on graphs using GraphPad Prism software.
AMP determination by MALDI-TOF spectrometry
Cells were washed in cold PBS and resuspended in PBS supplemented with 50 mM ATP in the presence or absence of CD39 inhib-
itors (ARL67156 100 mM, CD39 antibodies or isotype controls at 15 mg/ml) for 30 minutes at 4�C. After centrifugation, the AMP levels
in the supernatant were determined by mass spectrometry. Briefly, an internal standard working solution was prepared by directly
mixing GMP (m/z = 364.06) with matrix solution (5 mg/ml cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic solved in 70% acetonitrile/0.1% TFA). Equal vol-
umes of analyte and internal standard solutions were mixed and two microliters of the mixture was spotted in triplicate onto the
MALDI-TOF target plate. For each spot, a 4800 Plus MALDI-TOF/TOF Proteomics Analyzer was used to acquire 40 mass spectra
automatically (50 shots/spectrum) in positive reflector ion mode in the m/z 250-370 range. For quantitative measurements, the laser
power was adjusted automatically to prevent signal saturation. Only spectra for which the maximum peak height was within a specific
interval were retained. The spectra were averaged and the analyte/internal standard peak area ratios were calculated as response

e6
 factors, by averaging four measurements. A calibration curve obtained with pure AMP (10-50 mM) was used to calculate the concen-
tration in each sample. Results are expressed as the fold-increase in AMP levels relative to ATP alone or as percentage inhibition of
AMP generation relative to isotype control conditions.
Isolation of immune cells
Spleens and tumors were recovered in ice-cold PBS supplemented with 0.5% BSA and 2 mM EDTA (dissociation buffer) and were
mechanically dissociated. For spleens, red blood cells were eliminated by adding 2 mL ACK lysing buffer. White blood cells were
recovered by centrifugation, washed with PBS and resuspended in RPMI 1640 plus 10% FCS for functional assays or in flow cytom-
etry buffer (2% FCS, 0.5 M EDTA, 0.02% NaN3 in PBS) for staining and flow cytometry analysis. Human tissues, MCA205 and MC38
tumors were minced to generate 2 mm3 fragments, which were treated with collagenase IVs (200 mg/ml for mouse tissues, 1 mg/ml for
human tissues) and DNase (50 U/ml) in Hank’s balanced salt solution for 1 hour at 37�C in C Tubes (Miltenyi Biotec). Mechanical
dissociation was performed simultaneously, with a gentleMACS dissociator, according to the appropriate preprogrammed protocol
provided by the manufacturer. After dissociation, the tumor cells were passed through filters with 70 mm and 40 mm pores (Falcon;
Cell Strainerr) and centrifuged. Pellets were resuspended in RPMI 1640 plus 10% FCS for functional assays or in flow cytometry
buffer for staining and flow cytometry.
Blockade of membrane-associated CD39 or CD73 activity
WIL2-NS and Mino cell lines were plated in TBS in presence of a dose range of anti-CD39 Abs for a 1 hour incubation period at 37�C.
20 mM ATP were added to the cells for 1-additional hour at 37�C. Supernatants were transferred into 96W white microplates (Greiner
Bio One) and CellTiter GloTM was added to the plates. Emitted light was measured on an Enspire plate reader.
A375 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines were plated in TBS in presence of a dose range of anti-CD73 Abs for a 1 hour incubation period at
4�C. 12.5 mM AMP were added to the cells for 1-additional hour at 4�C. Supernatants were transferred into 96W white microplates
and residual AMP was quantified using the AMP GloTM assay. Emitted light was measured on an Enspire plate reader. Residual ATP
or AMP versus Ab concentration were plotted on graphs and EC50 were calculated using GraphPad Prism software.
The percentage of enzymatic activity inhibition was calculated as described below:
ðCells + ATðMÞP + AbÞ � ðCells + ATðMÞPÞ
ðATðMÞPÞ � ðCells + ATðMÞPÞ
3 100
Blockade of soluble CD39 or CD73 activity
WIL2-NS and Mino cell lines (106 cells/ml) were cultured for 24 h at 37�C then cell supernatants (SN) were carefully picked-up, centri-
fuged at 140 g for 10 min at RT, transferred into new tubes and centrifuged at 368 g for 10 min at RT. SN were distributed in 96-well
flat-bottom plates in presence of anti-CD39 Ab dose-ranges and incubated for 1 hour at 37�C. 20 mM ATP were added and plates
were incubated 2h at 37�C. The reactional medium was transferred into Microclear-96 plates and residual ATP was quantified using
the CellTiter GloTM assay. A375 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines (1.2x106 and 2.4x106 cell/cm2, respectively) were cultured for 36 h at
37�C then cell supernatants (SN) were carefully picked-up, centrifuged twice at 3000 g for 5 min at RT. SN were distributed in 96-
well flat-bottom plates in presence of anti-CD73 Ab dose-ranges and incubated for 1 hour at 37�C. 200 mM AMP were added and
plates were incubated 2 h at 37�C. The reactional medium was transferred into Microclear-96 plates and residual AMP was quantified
using the AMP GloTM assay. In both assays, luminescence was quantified on an Enspire plate reader. Residual ATP/AMP versus Ab
concentration was plotted on graphs using GraphPad Prism software. The percentage of enzymatic activity inhibition was calculated
as previously described by replacing cells by SN in the formula.
In vitro enzymatic assay on recombinant soluble CD39
50 to 800 ng/ml of recombinant human CD39 were incubated in white 96W flat-bottom microplates in the presence of a dose range of
anti-CD39 or isotype control Abs or ARL67156 chemical inhibitor. Plates were incubated for 1h at 37�C. Depending on the experi-
ment, 12.5 mM or 20 mM ATP were added to each well and plates were incubated at 37�C for 30 supplemental minutes. Lucif-
erase/luciferin-containing CellTiter Glo was added into wells, plates were incubated for 5 minutes at RT in the dark and emitted light
was measured using an Enspire plate reader. Luminescence units versus anti-CD39 Ab concentration was plotted in graphs using
GraphPad Prism software.
T cell proliferation assay
Peripheral blood from healthy donors was obtained from the EFS and mononuclear cells were isolated on a Ficoll gradient. Lympho-
cytes were further enriched on a 52% Percoll gradient (cell pellets) and stained with a 2 mM CellTrace Violet (Thermofisher, #C34557).
5x104 to 1x105 of stained cells were distributed in 96w round-bottom plates, incubated for 1h at 37�C with anti-CD39 or anti-CD73
Abs and activated for 3 to 5 days by addition of anti-CD3/anti-CD28-coated beads. Inhibition of T cell proliferation was achieved by
addition of 200 mM ATP (CD39 analysis) or AMP (CD73 analysis). T cell proliferation and the ability of Abs to block the immune sup-
pressive effect of AMP were assessed by flow cytometry by quantifying the dye dilution on proliferating T cells. Percentage of prolif-
erating T cells versus anti-CD73 Ab concentration is plotted on graphs using GraphPad Prism software. Some experiments were
e7

 done on whole PBMC from healthy donors or cancer patients. Protocol is as described above except that T cell suppression was
achieved by addition of 0.5 to 1 mM ATP.
In order to compare donors or patients, T cell proliferation was normalized using the following formula:
ðActivated cells + ATðMÞP + AbÞ � ðActivated cells + ATðMÞPÞ
ðActivated cellsÞ � ðActivated cells + ATðMÞPÞ
3 100
Allogeneic mixed Lymphocyte Reaction (MLR) assay
Mononuclear cells from healthy donors (EFS Marseille) were isolated on a Ficoll gradient and monocytes were purified by immuno-
magnetic selection using CD14 microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec). Monocytes were differentiated into dendritic cells (MoDC) by 5-7 days
of culture in presence of GM-CSF (400 ng/ml) and IL-4 (20 ng/ml). The day of DC recovery, CD4+ T cells from allogeneic donors were
purified by immunomagnetic depletion of non-CD4+ T cells (Miltenyi Biotec) and stained with Cell Trace Violet. DC (104 cells/well) and
T cells (5x104 cells/well) were mixed in 96W round bottom microplates in presence of a dose-ranges of anti-huCD73 Abs and a fixed
dose of ATP. T cell proliferation and Ab ability to reverse ATP-mediated suppression was assessed as described for T cell prolifer-
ation assay. In some experiments, MoDC were activated 24 hour with ATP in presence of anti-CD39 Abs, extensively washed and
incubated with allogeneic CD4+ T cells as described above.
CD39 effect on inflammasome pathway
Purified monocytes were differentiated into M1-like macrophages (M1) by 7 days of culture in presence of GM-CSF (400 ng/ml). Cells
were incubated with 10 mg/ml anti-CD39 Abs (1 hour, 37�C), then stimulated with 10 ng/ml LPS (3 h, 37�C) before addition of ATP (2 h,
37�C). IL-1beta was quantified by ELISA in cell culture supernatant following provider recommendations. IL-1beta concentration
versus ATP concentration was plotted on graph using GraphPad Prism software.
Protein expression and purification for crystallization study
CD73 and IPH5301 Fab were produced in CHO mammalian cells and purified from culture supernatant fraction on immobilized metal
ion affinity chromatography using a 5 mL HisTrap Excel (GE Healthcare) Ni2+- chelating column equilibrated in buffer A (20mM
HEPES pH7.5, 150mM NaCl, 10mM imidazole). The protein was eluted with buffer A supplemented with 250mM imidazole and
was further purified by a size exclusion chromatography (HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200 prep grade, GE) equilibrated in 20mM HEPES
pH7.5, 150mM NaCl. Purity of the protein was monitored using SDS–PAGE and visualized by Coomassie blue staining. The complex
between CD73 and IPH5301 Fab was digested with PNGase F (sigma-Aldrich) at ratio of 1nmol:1U in size exclusion buffer at 37�C for
16 h. After digestion, size exclusion chromatography was performed with Superdex S200 Hiload 16/60 (GE Healthcare) in 20mM
HEPES pH7.5, 150mM NaCl. In order to improve the homogeneity of sample, a ion exchange chromatography (MonoS 4.6/10 PE,
GE Healthcare) was added. The protein concentration was determined by the absorbance of the sample at 280nm using a NanoDrop
2000. The complex between CD73 and IPH53 IgG was analyzed by size exclusion chromatography performed with Superose 6-In-
crease 5/150 GL (GE Healthcare) in 20mM HEPES pH7.4, 150mM NaCl, 3%Glycerol.
Negative Staining of CD73-IPH5301 complex
6 mL of a purified CD73-IPH5301 complex at 0.01 mg/mL were deposited onto a glow-discharged carbon-coated grid (Formwar/Car-
bon 300 mesh Cu, Agar Scientific) using a PELCO easiGlow Glow Discharge Cleaning System (Ted Pella Inc., USA). Current: 25 mA,
time: 25 s and incubated for one minute. Sample excess was blotted off, rinsed with two 20 mL drops of water and stained with 10 mL
of 0.75% uranyl formate for 30 s. Micrographs (100) were recorded on a Veleta 2K x 2K CCD camera using a Tecnai T12 Spirit electron
microscope (FEI Company) operated at 120 kV and a magnification of 130,0003 (resulting in a pixel size of 3.46 A
˚ /pixel). The align-
ment procedure was done iteratively and was considered completed when overall image shifts and rotations no longer decrease
upon further alignment cycles. The aligned images were then subjected to classification. After specifying into how many classes
the images should be sorted, the images in each class were averaged to create class averages. The 2D class averages are calculated
by refine2D.py software in the EMAN package (Ludtke et al., 1999).
Crystallization, data collection and processing
Initial crystallization trials for CD73-IPH5301 were performed by the sitting-drop vapor-diffusion method at 293K in 96-well Swissci
plates using a Mosquito Crystal robot (TTP Labtech) with the following screens: Pact Premier Screen (Molecular Dimensions), Wizard
I and II (Emerald BioSystems), JCSG+ Suite (QIAGEN), LMB screen (Molecular Dimensions), Morpheus (Molecular Dimensions)
Ammonium sulfate Suite (QIAGEN) and Index (Hampton Research). Crystallization hit for the complex CD73-IPH5301 (16.5mg/
mL) occurred in condition No. G7 of the JCSG+ [15% PEG 3350, 0.1M succinic acid pH7]. After optimization (Lartigue et al.,
2003), the final crystallization conditions were 0.1M succinic acid pH6.5-7.5, 10%–20% (w/v) PEG 3350. Crystals were briefly soaked
in crystallization solution supplemented with 30% (v/v) glycerol. Diffraction data were collected to 2.78 A
˚ resolution on beamline
Proxima-1 at SOLEIL, Paris, France. The datasets were integrated with XDS (Kabsch, 2010) and were scaled with SCALA (Evans,
2006) from CCP4 Suite (Winn et al., 2011). Data collection statistics are reported in Table S4.

 Structure determination
The structure of the complex CD73-IPH5301 was solved by molecular replacement with MOLREP (Vagin and Teplyakov, 2010) using
the structure of human CD73 (PDB: 4H1S, closed form) and the Fab contained in the PDB: 3T2N as starting models. Refinement was
performed with autoBUSTER (Blanc et al., 2004) and the structures were corrected with COOT (Emsley et al., 2010). Refinement
statistics are reported in Table S4.
ELISA to assess recognition of CD39 and CD39-like proteins
1 mg/ml of recombinant human CD39 or CD39L proteins (all from Bio-Techne) were coated on MaxiSorp ELISA plates (Nunc) in PBS,
overnight at 4�C. Plates were washed 5 times in washing buffer (PBS, 0.05% Tween20) and unspecific sites were saturated by adding
200 ml/w TBS starting block buffer (ThermoFisher Scientific). A dose-range of anti-CD39 antibodies was added and incubated for
2 hours at RT. Plates were washed 5 times in washing buffer and HRP-conjugated goat anti-human or goat anti-mouse IgG Fc frag-
ment secondary Ab (bethyl) was added for 1 hour at RT to detect bound anti-CD39 Abs. Plates were washed 5 times in washing buffer
and bound secondary Ab was revealed by adding TMB (HRP substrate) and incubating plates for 5 to 10 min at RT in the dark. Enzy-
matic reaction was stopped by adding HCl 1 M and optical density (OD) at 450 nm was measured on Enspire plate reader. OD versus
anti-CD39 Ab concentration was plotted on graphs and EC50 was calculated using GraphPad Prism software.
SPR analysis to assess Ab KD on recombinant CD39 or CD73 proteins
SPR measurements were performed on a Biacore T200 apparatus at 25�C. Protein-A was immobilized on a Sensor Chip CM5. The
chip surface was activated with EDC/NHS amine coupling kit. Protein-A was diluted to 10 mg/ml in coupling buffer (10 mM acetate, pH
5.6) and injected until the appropriate immobilization level was reached (i.e., 2000 RU). Deactivation of the remaining activated
groups was performed using 100 mM ethanolamine pH 8 (GE Healthcare). Affinity study was carried out according to a standard
Capture-Kinetic protocol recommended by the manufacturer (GE Healthcare kinetic wizard). Serial dilutions of human recombinant
soluble CD39 or CD73 proteins, ranging from 1.23 to 300 nM were sequentially injected over the captured anti-CD39 or anti-CD73
antibodies and allowed to dissociate for 10 min before regeneration. The entire sensorgram sets were fitted using the 1:1 kinetic bind-
ing model. Monovalent affinities (CD39) and bivalent affinities (CD73) and kinetic association and dissociation rate constants are
calculated.
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Statistical analyses were performed with the non-parametric Mann-Whitney test for comparisons of two unpaired groups, the
Wilcoxon t test for comparisons of two paired groups, the Kruskal-Wallis test followed by a Dunn’s multiple comparisons test for
comparisons of multiple unpaired groups and Kaplan-Meier test for survival analyses. Statistical analyses were performed with Prism
7 software. Differences between groups were considered statistically significant if p < 0.05.
