Abstract
Importance—Major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) are a 
significant source of perioperative morbidity and mortality following non-cardiac surgery.
Objective—To evaluate national trends in perioperative cardiovascular outcomes and mortality 
after major non-cardiac surgery and identify surgical subtypes associated with cardiovascular 
events using a large administrative database of United States hospital admissions.
Design, Setting, Participants—Patients who underwent major non-cardiac surgery from 2004 
to 2013 were identified using the National Inpatient Sample.
Main Outcomes—Perioperative MACCE (primary outcome), defined as in-hospital, all-cause 
death, acute myocardial infarction (AMI), or acute ischemic stroke, were evaluated over time.
Results—Among 10,581,621 hospitalizations for major non-cardiac surgery, perioperative 
MACCE occurred in 317,479 (3.0%), corresponding to an annual incidence of ≈150,000 after 
applying sample weights. Major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events occurred most 
frequently in patients undergoing vascular (7.7%), thoracic (6.5%), and transplant surgery (6.3%). 
Between 2004 and 2013, the frequency of MACCE declined from 3.1% to 2.6% (p for trend 
<0.0001; adjusted OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.94–0.97) driven by a decline in frequency of perioperative 
death (adjusted OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.77–0.81) and AMI (adjusted OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.84–0.89) but 
with an increase in perioperative ischemic stroke from 0.52% in 2004 to 0.77% in 2013 (p for 
trend <0.0001; adjusted OR 1.79; CI 1.73–1.86).
Conclusions & Relevance—Perioperative MACCE occurs in 1 of every 33 hospitalizations for 
non-cardiac surgery. Despite reductions in the rate of death and AMI among patients undergoing 
major non-cardiac surgery in the United States, perioperative ischemic stroke increased over time.

Introduction
Worldwide, more than 300 million non-cardiac surgeries are performed each year.1 Major 
adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCE), including myocardial 
infarction and ischemic stroke, are a significant source of perioperative morbidity and 
mortality.2,3 Cardiovascular complications prolong inpatient hospitalization, increase 
medical costs, and are the leading cause of perioperative death.4,5 Over the past decades, 
there have been improvements in perioperative risk stratification, advances in surgical and 
anesthetic technique, and ongoing efforts to improve perioperative cardiovascular care with 
large therapeutic trials in the perioperative period.6–10 At the same time, the rising burden of 
cardiovascular risk factors in the population undergoing non-cardiac surgery may attenuate 
improvements in perioperative outcomes over time.11
Despite the significant burden of perioperative events place on the national health care 
system, trends in perioperative MACCE among patients hospitalized for major non-cardiac 
surgery have not been reported in the contemporary era.5 We sought to evaluate national 
trends in perioperative cardiovascular outcomes and mortality after non-cardiac surgery and 
identify surgical predictors of in-hospital perioperative cardiovascular events using a large 
administrative database of hospital admissions from the United States.
Methods
Study Population
Patients age ≥45 years requiring major non-cardiac surgery between 2004 and 2013 were 
included in this analysis. Patients were identified using the Healthcare Cost and Utilization 
Project’s (HCUP) National Inpatient Sample (NIS), a large administrative database of 
discharge-level data from a 20 percent stratified sample of all hospitals in the United States 
with de-identified data from approximately 8 million hospitalizations per year.12 Patients 
were included if they had a principal Clinical Classifications Software (CCS) procedure 
code representing a major therapeutic operating room procedure (HCUP Procedure Class 4). 
Principal CCS procedure codes represent an aggregate of relevant primary International 
Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) procedure codes by surgical subtype. 
Patients who underwent cardiac procedures (n=1,655,567), cardiac surgery and cardiac 
transplantation (n=582,726), bone marrow transplantation (n=18,151), ophthalmologic 
surgery (n=13,342), radiation therapy (n=9,817), dental surgery (n=1,779), and non-
operating room procedures (n=386) as a principal in-hospital procedure were excluded. 
Major non-cardiac surgery CCS procedure codes were clustered into 13 major surgical 
subtypes: breast, endocrine, otolaryngology, general, genitourinary, gynecologic,

 neurosurgery, obstetrics, orthopedic, skin and burn, thoracic, non-cardiac transplant, and 
vascular surgery.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events 
(MACCE), defined as in-hospital all-cause death, acute myocardial infarction (AMI), or 
ischemic stroke. AMI was identified using ICD-9 diagnosis codes for acute ST elevation MI 
(410.×1) and non-ST elevation MI (410.71). Acute ischemic stroke was identified using 
ICD-9 diagnosis codes 433.×1, 434.×1, 436, and 437.1.13 Other outcomes evaluated were 
complete heart block using ICD-9 diagnosis code 426.0, cardiogenic shock using ICD-9 
diagnosis code 785.51, and cardiac arrest using ICD-9 diagnosis code 427.5.
Statistical Analysis
Continuous variables were reported as mean ± standard deviation (SD) and compared using 
the Student’s t test and analysis of variance tests for multiple comparisons. Categorical 
variables were reported as percentages and compared by Chi-square tests. Analyses of 
proportions over time were performed using the Cochran-Armitage test for trend. 
Multivariable logistic regression models were generated to estimate odds of perioperative 
cardiovascular events, adjusted for patient demographics, cardiovascular risk factors, and 
relevant comorbidities. Models included age, sex, race/ethnicity, obesity, tobacco use, 
hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, end stage renal 
disease, coronary artery disease, prior revascularization with either PCI or CABG, peripheral 
artery disease, valvular heart disease, congestive heart failure, prior venous 
thromboembolism, chronic lung disease, alcohol abuse, malignancy, anemia, elective/urgent 
hospitalization, surgery type and year of hospitalization as covariates. To facilitate data 
presentation in the tables, patient characteristics and adverse-event rates were reported in 2-
year intervals: 2004–2005, 2006–2007, 2008–2009, 2010–2011, and 2012–2013. Sampling 
weights were applied to calculate rates for trend analyses and to determine national 
incidence estimates.14 Unweighted data were used in all other analyses, unless otherwise 
specified. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 20 (IBM SPSS Statistics, 
Armonk, NY). Statistical tests are two-sided and P-values < 0.05 were considered to be 
statistically significant.
Sensitivity Analyses
Several sensitivity analyses were performed to validate the study findings. In order to 
confirm established associations between validated risk factors and perioperative MACCE in 
this national dataset, the incidence of perioperative MACCE was determined for subgroups 
by modified Revised Cardiac Risk Index (RCRI) score using ICD-9 codes for ischemic heart 
disease, heart failure, prior TIA or stroke, chronic kidney disease, diabetes, and high-risk 
surgery.7 Due to the introduction of an ICD9 diagnosis code for prior stroke or TIA in 
mid-2007, modified RCRI scores were calculated from 2008–2013 data. To exclude cases in 
which MACCE may have preceded the primary non-cardiac surgery, a sensitivity analysis 
was performed excluding patients who were hospitalized urgently or emergently. Similarly, a 
sensitivity analysis was performed in the cohort of patients who underwent non-cardiac 
surgery within the first 72 hours of hospital admission. Finally, due to the established risks

 of perioperative stroke in patients undergoing major vascular surgery,15 a sensitivity analysis 
was performed excluding this high-risk cohort.
Results
Study Population
From 2004 to 2013, 12,863,389 hospitalizations for major surgery were identified among 
patients aged ≥45 years. After excluding patients undergoing cardiac surgery, low-risk and 
nonoperative procedures, the final study sample consisted of 10,581,621 hospitalizations for 
major non-cardiac surgery (Supplemental Figure 1). This corresponds to an estimated 
50,558,529 surgical hospitalizations in the United States during this time period, after 
applying sampling weights.
Major Adverse Cardiovascular and Cerebrovascular Events
Major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events occurred in 317,479 major non-
cardiac surgeries (3,000 events per 100,000 [3.0%]), corresponding to an estimated 
1,510,694 perioperative events in the United States during this time period, after applying 
sampling weights. Non-fatal AMI occurred in the perioperative period of 80,076 surgeries 
(757 events per 100,000 [0.76%]), non-fatal stroke occurred in 57,350 (542 events per 
100,000 [0.54%]), both non-fatal AMI and non-fatal stroke occurred in 3,094 (29 events per 
100,000 [0.03%]), and death occurred in 176,959 (1672 events per 100,000 [1.67%]) 
patients. Demographics and baseline characteristics of patients with and without 
perioperative MACCE are shown in Table 1. Patients who had a MACCE were older, more 
likely to be male, and more likely to have cardiovascular risk factors when compared with 
those who did not experience a MACCE (Table 1). As expected, patients with the highest 
RCRI scores were most likely to have perioperative MACCE compared with patients with 
the lowest RCRI scores (10,829 vs. 1,261 events per 100,000 surgeries, p<0.0001) 
(Supplemental Figure 2).
Among all patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery, complete heart block was identified in 
8,264 cases (78 events per 100,000 surgeries [0.08%]), cardiogenic shock occurred in 10,789 
cases (102 events per 100,000 surgeries [0.10%]) and cardiac arrest occurred in 34,345 cases 
(325 events per 100,000 surgeries [0.32%]).
Trends in Major Adverse Cardiovascular and Cerebrovascular Events
Between 2004 and 2013, the number of perioperative MACCE per 100,000 surgeries 
declined by 580 (95% CI 559 to 602), from 3,181 to 2,601 (p for trend <0.0001; adjusted 
OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.94–0.97) (Table 2, Figure 1). The rate of perioperative mortality per 
100,000 surgeries declined by 695 (95% CI, 679 to 711), from 1,978 to 1,283 (p for trend 
<0.0001; adjusted OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.77–0.81). The rate of perioperative AMI per 100,000 
surgeries decreased by 205 (95% CI 193 – 217), from 1,004 to 799 (p for trend <0.0001; 
adjusted OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.84–0.89). Conversely, perioperative ischemic stroke per 
100,000 surgeries increased over time by 244 (95% CI, 234 – 254), from 524 to 768 (p for 
trend <0.0001; adjusted OR 1.79; CI 1.73–1.86). The odds of MACCE over time, after

 multivariable adjustment for demographics, clinical covariates, and surgical type, are shown 
in Supplemental Figure 3.
Similar trends in perioperative MACCE, death, AMI, and stroke were observed in a 
sensitivity analysis of patients who were electively hospitalized for non-cardiac surgery, as 
well as in a sensitivity analysis of patients who underwent the principal non-cardiac surgery 
within the first 72 hours of hospital admission (Supplemental Figures 4A–4B). After 
excluding patients who underwent major vascular surgery, similar trends in perioperative 
MACCE and the individual endpoints were also observed. (Supplemental Figures 4C)
Surgery-Specific Perioperative Cardiovascular Risks
Patients undergoing vascular surgery (7,707 events per 100,000), thoracic (6,515 events per 
100,000), and transplant surgery (6,261 events per 100,000) had the highest rates of 
perioperative MACCE. The lowest risks were observed in patients undergoing obstetric and 
gynecologic surgery. The frequency of perioperative MACCE by all surgery types is shown 
in Figure 2. After multivariable adjustment, thoracic (OR 2.07, 95% CI 2.03 – 2.11), 
vascular (OR 1.96, 95% CI 1.94 – 1.98) and transplant surgery (OR 1.80, 95% CI 1.67 – 
1.95) remained associated with the highest risks of perioperative MACCE when compared 
with general surgery (Table 3).
Perioperative Cardiovascular Outcomes by Sex & Race/Ethnicity
Perioperative MACCE was more frequent among men than women (3521 events per 
100,000 surgeries [3.5%] vs. 2611 events per 100,000 [2.6%], p<0.0001; adjusted OR 1.17, 
95% CI 1.16–1.18), with higher in-hospital mortality (1984 events per 100,000 surgeries 
[2.0%] vs. 1439 events per 100,000 [1.4%], p<0.0001; adjusted OR 1.22, 95% CI 1.20–
1.23), AMI (1118 events per 100,000 surgeries [1.1%] vs. 832 events per 100,000 [0.8%], 
p<0.0001; adjusted OR 1.14, 95% CI 1.13–1.16) and ischemic strokes (771 events per 
100,000 surgeries [0.8%] vs. 592 events per 100,000 [0.6%]; p<0.0001; adjusted OR 1.05, 
95% CI 1.04–1.07). Declines in perioperative MACCE, in-hospital death, and AMI, and 
increases in perioperative acute ischemic stroke were observed over time in both sexes 
(Supplemental Figure 5).
Rates of perioperative MACCE varied by race and ethnicity. Non-Hispanic black patients 
experienced significantly more MACCE than non-Hispanic white patients (3795 events per 
100,000 surgeries [3.8%] vs. 2892 events per 100,000 [2.9%], adjusted OR 1.14, 95% CI 
1.13 – 1.16). Black patients also had higher rates of perioperative death (adjusted OR 1.24, 
95% CI 1.22–1.26) and stroke (adjusted OR 1.17, 95% CI 1.14–1.20) than non-Hispanic 
white patients, although differences in the rates of adverse events narrowed over time. 
Trends in MACCE by race and ethnicity are shown in Supplemental Figure 6.
Discussion
In this analysis of 10.5 million in-hospital major non-cardiac surgeries, perioperative 
MACCE occurred in 3.0% of patients, with vascular, thoracic, and non-cardiac transplant 
surgeries conferring the highest risks of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The rate of 
perioperative MACCE declined from 2004 to 2013, due to reductions in perioperative death

 and AMI. In contrast, rates of perioperative ischemic stroke increased during the study 
timeframe. Men had higher risk of perioperative MACCE than women in unadjusted and 
multivariable adjusted models. In analyses of perioperative events by race and ethnicity, non-
Hispanic black patients had the highest rates of perioperative death and ischemic stroke in 
comparison to other racial groups.
Since the publication of the initial Goldman multifactorial index of cardiac risk in 1977,6 
adverse cardiovascular events have been recognized as a major cause of perioperative 
morbidity and mortality. Nearly 40 years later, efforts to identify patients at the greatest risk 
for perioperative MACCE and to reduce morbidity and mortality following non-cardiac 
surgery remain ongoing. In this contemporary analysis, perioperative MACCE still occurs in 
1 in every 33 hospitalizations for non-cardiac surgery, corresponding to approximately 
150,000 perioperative events each year in the United States. This is the first study to report 
national data on the cardiovascular outcomes of in-hospital major non-cardiac surgery in the 
modern era, with multivariable adjusted predictors of perioperative death, ischemic stroke, 
AMI, and the composite of MACCE. Furthermore, this is the largest analysis of time trends 
in perioperative cardiovascular outcomes in the United States.
The observed reductions in overall perioperative MACCE are encouraging. These may be 
due to improved surgical case selection, advances in the management of cardiovascular risk 
factors and disease, improved surgical techniques, including increased use of minimally 
invasive surgical interventions, improved anesthetic techniques, enhanced intraoperative 
monitoring, and advanced post-operative critical care. Reductions in myocardial infarction 
during the study are surprising, given the increase in the sensitivity of modern cardiac 
biomarkers necessary for the diagnosis of myocardial infarction during the study 
timeframe.16 However, declines in AMI may be attributed to improved pharmacologic and 
percutaneous strategies in the management of coronary artery disease, and the recognition of 
thrombotic risks early post-percutaneous coronary intervention.17–19
Stroke incidence rates have declined steadily over the past decades in the United States.20,21 
In the context of these national trends, the observed increase in the rate of perioperative 
ischemic stroke is a concerning finding that warrants additional study. The rising rates of 
stroke in the perioperative period may be attributable to an increased prevalence of 
cardiovascular risk factors of surgical patients, carotid stenosis or cerebrovascular disease, 
atrial arrhythmias, or changes in intraoperative hemodynamic management.22 Alternatively, 
increases in perioperative ischemic strokes may be related to increased use of perioperative 
beta blockade.9 Importantly, in these analyses, we found a strong association between 
perioperative stroke and patients undergoing vascular surgery. While vascular surgery 
patients are likely to have the highest atherosclerotic burden and the greatest risk for 
ischemic complications following surgery, this strong association also raises the possibility 
that perhaps some patients in this cohort underwent a major vascular procedure or surgery as 
a consequence of ischemic stroke. After excluding patients who underwent vascular surgery, 
an increase in the rate of perioperative ischemic stroke over time was still observed. This 
trend also persisted in sensitivity analyses of patients who were electively hospitalized for 
surgery, and among patients who underwent the principal non-cardiac surgery within the

 first 72 hours of hospital admission. In these sensitivity analyses, patients were unlikely to 
have presented with an acute stroke prior to the primary non-cardiac surgery.
There are some notable limitations of this study. First, analyses are based on administrative 
coding data, which may be subject to reporting bias or coding errors. Race and ethnicity data 
was missing for 17% of subjects. Second, the analysis was limited to adults over the age of 
45, the population at risk for cardiovascular complications of non-cardiac surgery. Rates of 
perioperative AMI are lower in this analysis than in some previously published studies, 
likely due to the inclusion of larger numbers of low-risk patients from the NIS dataset.9 
Third, the timing of non-fatal AMI or ischemic stroke after non-cardiac surgery cannot be 
firmly established from this administrative database. However, since major non-cardiac 
surgery is contraindicated early after AMI or stroke, patients presenting with these acute 
cardiovascular conditions were unlikely to undergo major non-cardiac surgery during the 
index hospital admission. Furthermore, trends in perioperative outcomes were similar in 
sensitivity analyses of patients undergoing surgery during elective hospitalization. Fourth, 
medical therapy was not available from this administrative dataset; consequently, the use of 
beta-blockers, antiplatelet agents, and other cardiovascular therapies in the perioperative 
period could not be evaluated. Fifth, although a history of heart failure was included in 
modeling, left ventricular function and other important markers of cardiovascular risk were 
not available for inclusion in this analysis. Finally, results of perioperative laboratory testing, 
including cardiac biomarkers, were not available from this administrative dataset. 
Myocardial injury after non-cardiac surgery, a well-described independent risk factor for 
short and long-term mortality, could not be ascertained and was not included in the 
composite outcome.4,23,24
Conclusions
This is the largest analysis of perioperative MACCE in patients undergoing major non-
cardiac surgery in the United States. Cardiovascular complications after non-cardiac surgery 
remain a major source of morbidity and mortality. Despite improvements in perioperative 
outcomes over the past decade, the significant increase in the rate of ischemic stroke in this 
analysis requires confirmation and further study. Additional efforts are necessary to improve 
perioperative cardiovascular care of patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery.
