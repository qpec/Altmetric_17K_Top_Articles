SUMMARY
Abnormal pain sensitivity is commonly associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) and 
affects the life quality of ASD individual. SHANK3 deficiency was implicated in ASD and pain 
dysregulation. Here we report functional expression of SHANK3 in mouse dorsal root ganglion 
(DRG) sensory neurons and spinal cord presynaptic terminals. Homozygous and heterozygous 
Shank3 complete knockout (Δe4–22) results in impaired heat hyperalgesia in inflammatory and 
neuropathic pain. Specific deletion of Shank3 in Nav1.8-expressing sensory neurons also impairs 
heat hyperalgesia in homozygous and heterozygous mice. SHANK3 interacts with transient 
receptor potential subtype V1 (TRPV1) via Proline-rich region and regulates TRPV1 surface 
expression. Furthermore, capsaicin-induced spontaneous pain, inward currents in DRG neurons, 
and synaptic currents in spinal cord neurons are all reduced after Shank3 haploinsufficiency. 
Finally, partial knockdown of SHANK3 expression in human DRG neurons abrogates TRPV1 
function. Our findings reveal a peripheral mechanism of SHANK3, which may underlie pain 
deficits in SHANK3-related ASDs.

 INTRODUCTION
Individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) show distinct neurobehavioral deficits, 
characterized by impairments in social interactions, deficits in communication as well as 
repetitive behaviors (Jiang and Ehlers, 2013; Kaiser and Feng, 2015; Lord et al., 2000). 
ASDs are also characterized by a wide sensory abnormalities related to touch, smell, taste, 
and pain (Allely, 2013; Klintwall et al., 2011). Environmental factors, including pesticides 
and fungicides have been linked to autism and neurodegeneration (Lord et al., 2000; Pearson 
et al., 2016). Pain is poorly assessed in ASD patients. They appear to have higher tolerance 
to painful injuries such as bumps and cuts. As many as 70% of ASD patients show self-
injurious behaviors, including head banging, skin picking, and self-biting (Furniss and 
Biswas, 2012). In sharp contrast, ASD children also display exaggerated behavioral 
responses to pain (Mandell et al., 2005; Nader et al., 2004; Rattaz et al., 2013). It was argued 
that ASD children have deficits in facial and behavioral expression of pain, which may lead 
caregivers to interpret this as pain insensitivity (Allely, 2013). This discrepancy results from 
our poor understanding of mechanisms underlying pain dysregulation in ASD. Interestingly, 
a recent study demonstrated that dysfunction of peripheral mechanosensory neurons 
contributes to tactile and behavioral deficits in mouse models of ASDs (Orefice et al., 2016).
Numerous genes have been implicated in ASDs including those that regulate synaptic 
transmission (Jiang and Ehlers, 2013). SHANK/ProSAP family proteins act as synaptic 
scaffolding proteins at postsynaptic density (PSD) of excitatory glutamatergic synapses 
(Sheng and Kim, 2000). Human genetic evidence indicates that SHANK family genes are 
strong causative genes for idiopathic ASDs. SHANK3 is one of the best implicated genes in 
ASDs, and SHANK3 mutations were found in ~2% of ASDs (Leblond et al., 2014; 
Moessner et al., 2007; Yi et al., 2016). Shank3 mutant mice exhibit dysregulation of 
glutamatergic synapses in their sizes, shapes, and functions, which is reminiscent of the 
phenotypes observed in mouse models of fragile X syndrome, Rett syndrome, and 
Angelman syndrome (Jiang and Ehlers, 2013; Wang et al., 2014a; Wang et al., 2011; Yoo et 
al., 2014). SHANK3 maps to the critical chromosome region of 22q13.3. Strikingly, clinical 
and genetic evaluation of 201 patients with Phelan–McDermid syndrome (Phelan et al., 
2001), also known as 22q13 deletion syndrome which includes the deletion of entire 
SHANK3 gene, demonstrates decreased pain sensitivity in 77% of patients (Sarasua et al., 
2014).
Different lines of Shank3 mutant mice, with deletions or mutations in different exons (exons 
4–7, 4–9, 11, 13–16, and 21), have been reported. However, these lines of Shank3 mutant 
mice show variable molecular, synaptic, and behavioral phenotypes, in part due to different 
manipulations of Shank3 isoforms (Jiang and Ehlers, 2013). To develop a more relevant 
ASD model, we generated Shank3 complete deficient mice by deleting exons 4 to 22. This 
deletion causes the absence of the entire SHANK3 protein coding sequence (Wang et al., 
2016). Shank3Δe4–22 mouse has high construct validity because the deletion of Shank3 in 
mice closely mimics the SHANK3 defects found in most patients with ASDs. Notably, 
Shank3Δe4–22 mice demonstrate robust behavioral phenotypes that recapitulate the major 
features in SHANK3-related ASD and PMS and highlight postsynaptic modulation of this 
gene in brain regions such as striatum (Wang et al., 2016).

 In this study, we investigated how SHANK3 regulates pain sensitivity in Shank3Δe4–22 mice. 
Specifically, we examined the role of SHANK3 in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) primary 
sensory neurons of the peripheral nervous system. We also examined SHANK3 expression 
in presynaptic sites in spinal cord central terminals of DRG neurons. We have revealed a 
peripheral and presynaptic role of SHANK3 in pain transduction and transmission via 
regulating transient receptor potential ion channel subtype V1 (TRPV1). Our data have also 
demonstrated that happoinsufficiency of SHANK3 causes profound defects in TRPV1 
function in mouse and human DRG neurons.
RESULTS
Heat hyperalgesia but not baseline pain is impaired in Shank3 (Δe4–22) mutant mice
To investigate a specific role of Shank3 in pain regulation, we tested baseline pain and 
inflammatory and neuropathic pain in Shank3 complete knockout mice, in which exons 4 to 
22 were deleted (Figure 1A). In this study, we referred Δe4–22−/− mice as Shank3−/− mice. 
We first compared the baseline thermal and mechanical sensitivity in homozygous 
(Shank3−/−), heterozygous (Shank3+/−), and wild-type (WT) mice. Hot plate test indicated 
that Shank3−/− mice exhibited no change in withdrawal latency at different temperatures (50, 
53, and 56 °C), compared to Shank3+/− and WT mice (Figure 1B). Von Frey test also 
showed no difference among three genotypes in paw withdrawal threshold to punctate 
mechanical stimuli (Figure 1C). Similarly, the cold sensitivity in cold plate and temperature 
preference test was unaltered in Shank3+/− and Shank3−/− mice (Figures 1D and S1A). 
Furthermore, Hargreaves test showed intact response to radiant heat in Shank3−/− mice 
(Figure 1E). Together, these data suggest that baseline pain sensitivity, i.e. normal pain 
perception and temperature sensation do not change in Shank3 global knockout mice.
Next, we investigated whether chronic pain is altered in Shank3 mutant mice. Intraplantar 
injection of complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA) induced persistent inflammatory pain for > 1 
week, as characterized by heat hyperalgesia (Figure 1E). This heat hyperalgesia was 
significantly impaired in both Shank3+/− mice and Shank3−/− mice (F(2, 60) = 34.4790, 
p<0.0001, Two-way ANOVA, Figure 1E). There was also significant difference between 
homozygous and heterozygous mice (F(1, 40) =7.7231, p =0.0083, Two-way ANOVA, Figure 
1E). This result indicates that loss of one copy of Shank3 is sufficient to cause pain defects, 
which is reminiscent of autism patients with haploinsufficiency mutations of SHANK3. 
However, CFA-induced edema was normal after Shank3 deficiency (Figure S1B), suggesting 
that inflammatory pain defect was not a result of impaired inflammation. Chronic 
constriction injury (CCI) also produced long-lasting heat hyperalgesia (> 4 weeks, Figure 
1F). This neuropathic pain symptom was reduced in both Shank3−/− and Shank3+/− mice 
(Figure 1F). Inflammatory and neuropathic pain is also characterized by mechanical 
allodynia, a reduction in paw withdrawal threshold in von Frey test. Shank3+/− and 
Shank3−/− mice displayed a mild but significant reduction in mechanical allodynia after CFA 
(F(2, 72)=6.9008, p = 0.0018, Two-way ANOVA) and CCI (F(2, 90)=7.5570, p=0.0009, Two-
way ANOVA) (Figures S1C and S1D). In contrast, acetone test showed that nerve injury-
induced cold allodynia was unaltered in Shank3 mutant mice (Figure S1E).

 Given a substantial reduction in heat hyperalgesia in Shank3 mutant mice, we postulated that 
heat transduction in sensory neurons could be impaired in these mice. The capsaicin receptor 
TRPV1 is expressed in C-fiber nociceptive neurons and upregulated in DRG neurons after 
inflammation and nerve injury (Ji et al., 2002; Obata et al., 2004). TRPV1 regulates heat 
transduction and is especially critical for the development of heat hyperalgesia (Caterina et 
al., 2000; Davis et al., 2000; Eskander et al., 2015). We tested capsaicin-induced pain in WT 
and Shank3 mutant mice. Intraplantar injection of capsaicin (10 µg) induced rapid (1–5 min) 
spontaneous pain (licking and flinching behavior) in WT mice, but this spontaneous pain 
was compromised in Shank3−/− and Shank3+/− mice (Figure 1G). Intraplantar capsaicin also 
resulted in neurogenic inflammation (paw edema), showing increased plasma extravasation 
in hind paw tissue in Evan Blue test (Figure 1H). The capsaicin-evoked plasma extravasation 
was reduced in Shank3−/− and Shank3+/− mice (Figure 1H). Interestingly, heterozygous and 
homozygous mice displayed similar defects in capsaicin responses (Figure 1G and 1H). 
Thus, Shank3 mutant mice have defects in both inflammation- and nerve injury-induced heat 
hyperalgesia due to compromised TRPV1 signaling.
To determine if there is sensory neuron loss in mutant mice, we quantified the number of 
Nissl-stained neurons from every fifth DRG sections of WT and Shank3−/− mice, but did not 
see significant loss of DRG neurons in Shank3−/− mice (1756 ± 191 in WT DRGs vs. 
1821.7±181 in Shank3−/− DRGs, p>0.05, Figure S2A). The percentages of TRPV1+, 
CGRP+, IB4+, and NF200+ neurons in Shank3−/− mice were unaltered (Figure S2A). Skin 
innervation of PGP9.5+ nerve fibers and spinal cord innervations of CGRP+, IB4+, and 
NF200+ axonal terminals were also normal in KO mice (Figure S2, B and C). Neither did we 
see neuronal loss in the spinal cord (Figure S2D). Together, we conclude that the deficit of 
heat hyperalgesia in Shank3 mutant mice is not due to cell loss and innervation deficits of 
DRG neurons.
SHANK3 is expressed by primary sensory neurons and their spinal cord central terminals
We employed several different approaches to examine SHANK3 expression in DRG primary 
sensory neurons. RT-PCR analysis revealed the expression of all the Shank3 isoforms 
including Shank3a, Shank3b, Shank3c, Shank3d, and Shank3e in DRG, as well as spinal 
cord, cerebellum, and cortex tissues (Figure 2A). Western blotting showed SHANK3 protein 
expression in DRG and spinal cord of WT mice not Shank3−/− mice, with lower expression 
levels compared with that of cerebellum and cortex (Figure 2B). We also examined the 
expression of different Shank3 isoforms in DRGs after CFA-induced inflammation and 
nerve injury (CCI) but did not find any upregulations of these isoforms, despite a moderate 
downregulation in Shank3 isoforms (Figure S1F). It is likely that pain-induced neuronal 
activity may cause the down-regulation, because neuronal activity has been shown to 
downregulate Shank3 isoforms in cortical neurons (Wang et al., 2014b).
Immunohistochemistry revealed that SHANK3 immunoreactivity (IR) is widely expressed in 
mouse DRG neurons, but SHANK3-IR in DRGs was lost in Shank3−/− mice (Figure 2C). 
Double staining showed that SHANK3-IR was highly expressed in small-sized peptidergic 
(Substance P+) and non-peptidergic (IB4+) neurons, as well as in large-size myelinated 
neurons (NF200+) in mouse DRG (Figure 2D). Cell size distribution analysis showed broad

 expression of SHANK3 in DRG neurons of different sizes, with predominant expression in 
small-sized neurons (<600 µm2, Figure 2E). We also observed SHANK3-IR in nerve fibers 
in the hindpaw glabrous skin, due to axonal transport of SHANK3 from DRG cell bodies to 
peripheral terminals (Figure S3A). In situ hybridization also showed wide expression of 
Shank3 mRNA in DRG neurons of WT mice but not Shank3−/− mice (Figure S3B). As in 
mouse DRG neurons, SHANK3 was widely expressed in rat DRG neurons too (Figures S3C 
and S3D).
Dense SHANK3-IR was also found in the spinal cord dorsal horn, especially in the 
superficial layers (laminae I-III) of WT mice but not in KO mice (Figures 2F and S3E). As 
in DRG neurons, SHANK3-IR is present in both peptidergic (SP+) and non-peptidergic 
(IB4+) axonal terminals in the superficial dorsal horn (Figures 2F, S3E, S3F). Interestingly, 
ablation of TRPV1-expressing C-fibers with systemic treatment of the neurotoxin 
resiniferatoxin (RTX) completely blocked the heat pain (Liu et al., 2010) and significantly 
reduced SHANK3-IR in the laminae I and IIo (Figures 2F and 2G). This result strongly 
suggests that SHANK3 in the superficial dorsal horn is originated, at least partly, from 
primary afferents. As expected, SHANK3-IR was also observed in many neurons in the deep 
dorsal horn (Figure S3E). Therefore, SHANK3 is expressed at both presynaptic sites 
(primary afferent terminals) and postsynaptic sites (neuronal somata) in the spinal cord 
dorsal horn.
TRPV1 currents in DRG neurons are substantially reduced in Shank3 mutant mice
To determine the molecular and neural mechanism by which SHANK3 regulates pain, we 
employed patch clamp recordings to assess TRPV1 function in dissociated small-diameter 
(<25 µm) DRG neurons of WT, Shank3+/− and Shank3−/− mice. Remarkably, inward 
currents induced by 100 nM capsaicin were substantially reduced in heterozygous mice and 
almost abolished in homozygous mice (Figures 3A and 3B). The percentage of DRG 
neurons responding to 100 nM capsaicin decreased from 55% (12/22) in WT mice to 30% 
(18/33 and 10/31) in Shank3+/− and Shank3−/− mice, respectively. Inward currents induced 
by high dose of capsaicin (1 µM) were also drastically reduced in Shank3+/− and Shank3−/− 
mice (Figure 3B). In parallel, capsaicin-induced intracellular Ca2+ increase was also reduced 
in Shank3-deficient neurons (Figures S4A and S4B). Interestingly, the TRPV1 defects in 
homozygous and heterozygous mice were comparable, and no statistic difference was found 
between these two genotypes (Figures 3A and 3B), indicating that haploinsufficiency of 
Shank3 is sufficient to disrupt TRPV1 function.
Human genetics strongly suggests that SCN9A, the human gene encoding sodium channel 
subunit Nav1.7, critically regulates pain sensitivity (Cox et al., 2006; Raouf et al., 2010). 
Interestingly, transient sodium currents, as well as Nav1.7-mediated sodium currents 
(isolated by Protoxin-II) (Sokolov et al., 2008) were normal in Shank3-deficient DRG 
neurons compared with WT neurons (Figure 3C). Neither did we find changes in neuronal 
excitability in Shank3−/− mice: Shank3-deficient neurons and WT neurons fired action 
potentials at the same rate (Figure 3D). Thus, sodium channels such as Nav1.7 may not 
contribute to pain defects in Shank3−/− mice.

 To rescue TRPV1 deficiency in Shank3-deficient neurons, we overexpressed Shank3 these 
deficient mouse DRG neurons through electroporation of Shank3a construct. Notably, 
overexpressing Shank3-gfp in Shank3-deficient DRG neurons increased TRPV1 currents to 
the levels of WT neurons (Figures 3E). Thus, mouse Shank3 gene is critical for the function 
of TRPV1 in primary sensory neurons.
Human SHANK3 mutation with a guanine insertion in exon 21 (InsG3680) is strongly 
associated with ASD (Durand et al., 2007). Over-expressing this SHANK3 mutant in 
Shank3-deficient DRG neurons failed to completely rescue TRPV1 currents (Figure 3E), 
despite higher expression of this mutant than WT Shank3 in DRG cultures after the 
transfection (Figure S4C). This result suggests an active role of SHANK3 mutation in 
regulating the TRPV1 function.
Capsaicin-induced spinal cord synaptic plasticity and pain following spinal application is 
compromised in Shank3 mutant mice
TRPV1 in central terminals of nociceptors regulates glutamate release from presynaptic 
terminals (Park et al., 2011). Next, we tested basal and capsaicin-evoked excitatory synaptic 
transmission in spinal cord slices of WT and Shank3−/− mice, by recording miniature 
excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) in lamina IIo neurons. These interneurons are 
predominantly excitatory, receive input from TRPV1-expressing primary afferents, and send 
output to lamina I projection neurons (Park et al., 2011; Todd, 2010). We found normal 
mEPSCs in Shank3-deficient lamina IIo neurons: both the frequency and amplitude of 
mEPSC were comparable in WT and Shank3−/− mice (Figures 3F, 3G, S4D, S4E). Capsaicin 
produced dose-dependent increases in mEPSC frequency but not mEPSC amplitude in WT 
mice; but these mEPSC frequency increases were substantially reduced after Shank3 
deficiency (Figures 3F and 3G). Thus, SHANK3 is also required for TRPV1-mediated 
synaptic plasticity (mEPSC frequency increase) via presynaptic modulation.
Given an important role of TRPM8 in cold sensation (Bautista et al., 2007), we tested the 
function of TRPM8 in DRG and spinal cord neurons in WT and Shank3−/− mice. Menthol 
induced comparable increases in intracellular Ca2+ in DRG neurons and mEPSC in spinal 
lamina IIo neurons of WT and Shank3−/− mice (Figures S4, F–H), suggesting an intact 
TRPM8 signaling after Shank3 deficiency. TRPC4 is expressed in DRG neurons and 
regulated in neuropathic pain (Staaf et al., 2009). Gadolinium chloride (GdCl3), an agonist 
of TRPC4, induced comparable inward currents in DRG neurons and mEPSC frequency 
increases in spinal cord neurons in WT and Shank3 KO mice (Figures S4, I–K), suggesting 
that TRPC4 function does not require SHANK3.
Spinal capsaicin injection via intrathecal (i.t.) route induces robust spontaneous pain via 
central TRPV1 at primary afferent terminals (Park et al., 2011). This spontaneous pain was 
reduced in both Shank3+/− and Shank3−/− mice (Figures 3H). Capsaicin also elicited 
phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (pERK) in superficial dorsal horn 
neurons, an essential step for central sensitization in persistent pain (Ji et al., 2003). The 
capsaicin-induced pERK was abolished in Shank3−/− mice (Figure S5). Thus, Shank3 is also 
important for central TRPV1 signaling in the spinal cord.

 Interaction of SHANK3 with TRPV1 in native DRG neurons and heterologous ND7/23 cells
Our behavioral and electrophysiological data support a functional interaction of SHANK3 
and TRPV1. We further examined biochemical interactions between these two important 
proteins. Double staining revealed co-localization of TRPV1 with SHANK3 in mouse DRG 
neurons (Figure 4A). TRPV1 is also co-localized with SHANK3 in spinal axonal terminals 
in the superficial dorsal horn (Figure 4B). Co-IP experiment showed possible interaction of 
SHANK3 and TRPV1 in mouse DRG (Figure 4C). Surface biotinylation analysis revealed a 
reduction of TRPV1 surface expression in Shank3-deficient DRG neurons (Figure 4D). We 
further tested SHANK3/TRPV1 interaction in heterologous ND7/23 cells, which are hybrid 
cells of neuroblastoma and DRG neurons (Dunn et al., 1991). Co-IP experiment validated 
the SHANK3/TRPV1 interaction in ND7/23 cells-expressing SHANK3 and TRPV1 
(Figures 4E and 4F). Surface biotinylation analysis also showed increased surface expression 
of TRPV1 in ND7/23 cells expressing Shank3 (Figure 4G). These results suggest that 
SHANK3 control the function TRPV1 by modulating its trafficking and surface expression.
SHANK3a consists of multiple domains for protein-protein interactions: ankyrin repeats 
(ANK), SH3 domain, PSD-95/Dlg/ZO-1 (PDZ) domain, Proline-rich region, and sterile 
alpha motif (SAM) domain (Figure 5A) (Jiang and Ehlers, 2013; Sheng and Kim, 2000). To 
define how SHANK3 interacts with TRPV1, we constructed 4 expression vectors: 
SHANK3a, PDZ554–686, Proline-rich891–1299, and Homer-SAM1302–1730 and over-expressed 
them with TRPV1 constructor in ND7/23 cells. We found the region891–1299 of Proline-rich 
domain but not PDZ554–686 and Homer-SAM1302–1730 domains was sufficient for the 
SHANK3/TRPV1 interaction (Figure 5B). Competing experiment further showed that 
Proline-rich891–1299 domain and SHANK3a competed for the interaction with TRPV1 in 
ND7/23 cells (Figure 5C). Transfection of WT mouse DRG neurons with Proline-
Rich891–1299 region of Shank3a drastically reduced TRPV1 currents (Figure 5, D and E), 
suggesting a role of this SHANK3 region in regulating TRPV1 function in native DRG 
neurons. It is noteworthy that Human SHANK3 mutation InsG3680 resulted in a truncated 
SHANK3 ending at the site 1227 of the Proline-rich891–1299 region (Durand et al., 2007), 
and this mutation also affected TRPV1 function in DRG neurons (Figure 3E).
Inflammatory pain, heat pain, and TRPV1 signaling are impaired after sensory neuron-
specific Shank3 deletion
To confirm a specific role of peripheral SHANK3 in pain regulation, we generated Shank3 
conditional KO (CKO) mice by crossing Shank3-floxed mice with NaV1.8-Cre mice (Figure 
6A), leading to specific deletion of Shank3 in nociceptive neurons as well as some low-
threshold A-fiber neurons (Agarwal et al., 2004; Shields et al., 2012). We then compared 
baseline pain and inflammatory pain in three genotypes: littermate control mice (Shank3f/f), 
heterozygous mice (NaV1.8-cre;Shank3f/+), and homozygous mice (NaV1.8-cre;Shank3f/f) 
(Figure 6B). We found a profound reduction (80%) of SHANK3-IR in the superficial dorsal 
horn (laminae I-III) in NaV1.8-cre;Shank3f/f mice (Figure 6, C and D), further supporting 
that SHANK3-IR in the superficial dorsal horn is largely originated from primary sensory 
neurons. Conditional heterozygous mice also showed a 60% reduction in SHANK3-IR in 
laminae I-III (Figure 6D). Remarkably, baseline heat sensitivity in hot plate and Hargreaves 
tests was impaired in homozygous mice showing increased withdrawal latency (Figure 6, E–
Han et al.

 G). However, temperature preference test showed no difference among three genotypes in 
mild test temperatures (21/21 °C and 15/25°C, Figure S6A). We also failed to see changes in 
body temperature (rectal temperature) in Shank3 conditional mutant mice and Trpv1 null 
mice (Figure S6B). Deficit in baseline heat sensitivity did not occur in heterozygous mutant 
mice (Figure 6, E and F). CFA-induced heat hyperalgesia was reduced in both homozygous 
and heterozygous CKO mice (Figure 6G). Von Frey test showed comparable baseline 
mechanical sensitivity in three genotypes, but CFA-induced mechanical allodynia was 
slightly decreased in homozygous and heterozygous mice (Figure S6C). Capsaicin-induced 
spontaneous pain was substantially reduced in homozygous and heterozygous CKO mice 
following intraplantar or intrathecal injection (Figure 6, H and I). It is noteworthy that 
SHANK3-IR in deep dorsal horn neurons (laminae IV-V) was unaltered (Figure S6D). 
Collectively, these data from Shank3 CKO mice strongly suggest that deletion of Shank3 in 
sensory neurons can recapitulate all pain defects in Shank3 global KO mice. Moreover, 
Shank3 homozygous but not heterozygous CKO mice showed heat deficit, a reminiscent of 
Trpv1 KO mice (Caterina et al., 2000).
SHANK3 expression in human DRG neurons regulates TRPV1 signaling
To evaluate the translational potential of this study, we further tested if SHANK3 would 
regulate TRPV1 function in human DRG neurons obtained from non-diseased donors. 
Immunohistochemistry and size frequency analysis showed very broad expression of 
SHANK3 in all types of human DRG neurons (Figure 7, A and B). We also observed high-
level of co-localization of SHANK3 and TRPV1 in human DRG neurons (Figure 7C). Co-
localization of SHANK3/TRPV1 was further observed in axons in human spinal nerve 
(Figure 7C), suggesting active axonal transport of both proteins. To define a critical role of 
SHANK3 in regulating TRPV1 function, we developed an effective method to knockdown 
SHANK3 expression in dissociated human DRG neurons using small-interfering RNA 
(siRNA). Figure 7D shows that siGLO-labeled siRNA could be up-taken by all human DRG 
neurons in primary cultures. Treatment of human DRG cultures with selective SHANK3 
siRNA (100 nM) lead to a partial reduction in SHANK3-IR (Figure 7E), which can mimic 
haploinsufficiency of SHANK3 in human. Patch clamp recordings in siGLO-labeled small-
diameter human DRG neurons (<50 µm) showed that capsaicin-induced inward currents 
were substantially suppressed (85 and 79% inhibition at 0.1 and 1 mM capsaicin, 
respectively) by SHANK3 siRNA, despite a partial (50%) knockdown of SHANK3 
expression (Figure 7, E–G). By contrast, the SHANK3 siRNA treatment did not change 
TRPV1 mRNA levels in human DRG cultures (Figure S7), arguing against the possibility of 
regulating TRPV1 expression by SHANK3. Competing experiment by over-expression of 
the Proline-rich891–1299 region further suggested an active role of this SHANK3 region in 
TRPV1 function regulation in human primary sensory neurons (Figure 7, H and I). 
Therefore, SHANK3 haploinsufficiency also causes a profound impairment of TRPV1 
function in human DRG neurons.
DISCUSSION
Using Shank3 complete knockout mice with deletion of exons 4 to 22 (Δe4–22 Shank3−/−), 
we have made several interesting findings in this study. First, SHANK3 is broadly expressed

 in cell bodies and central terminals of DRG primary sensory neurons. Second, same as in 
human SHANK3-related disorders, Shank3 haploinsufficiency in mice causes marked 
deficits in inflammatory pain and neuropathic pain with predominant reductions in heat 
hyperalgesia. Third, Shank3 CKO mice with Shank3 deficiency in Nav1.8-expressing 
sensory neurons can recapitulate all the pain defects in global knockout mice and display 
additional deficits in baseline heat sensitivity. Fourth, SHANK3 regulates TRPV1 function 
in both primary sensory neurons and presynaptic terminals and is also essential for 
capsaicin-evoked pain at both peripheral and central sites. Fifth, SHANK3 interacts with 
TRPV1 via the Proline-rich region of SHANK3 and regulates the trafficking and surface 
expression of TRPV1. Finally, SHANK3 is expressed in human DRG neurons and SHANK3 
knockdown dramatically disrupts TRPV1 currents in human sensory neurons.
Peripheral modulation of pain and heat sensation by SHANK3 via interaction with TRPV1
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate a peripheral role of 
SHANK3. We found broad SHANK3 expression in primary sensory neurons of both mouse 
and human DRGs. All the major Shank3 isoforms, including Shank3a, Shank3b, Shank3c, 
Shank3d, and Shank3e and full length SHANK3 protein expressed in mouse DRGs. 
Importantly, specific deletion of Shank3 in Nav1.8-expressing sensory neurons recapitulated 
all the pain deficits in Shank3 global KO mice, including severe defect in heat hyperalgesia 
and mild defect in mechanical allodynia. Thus, peripheral SHANK3 plays an essential role 
in driving heightened pain sensitivity after inflammation and nerve injury. It is noteworthy 
that Shank3 deletion does not cause neuronal loss in DRG and spinal cord. Neither does this 
deletion affect peripheral and central innervations of DRG neurons. Thus, pain defects in 
Shank3 mutant mice are not caused by developmental defects in sensory neurons and their 
projections.
TRPV1 is one of the most investigated transduction molecules in pain research (Caterina and 
Julius, 2001; Patapoutian et al., 2009). Little is known about scaffold proteins for TRPV1, 
although A-kinase anchoring protein (AKAP) regulates PKA phosphorylation of TRPV1 
and hyperalgesia (Jeske et al., 2008). Our findings demonstrated that SHANK3 is a scaffold 
protein for TRPV1 and critically regulates TRPV1 function in mouse and human primary 
sensory neurons. First, SHANK3 is co-localized with TRPV1 in sensory neurons and nerve 
axons of mouse and human DRGs. Second, capsaicin-induced inward currents are 
dramatically reduced in mouse DRG neurons after Shank3 haploinsufficiency. Strikingly, 
siRNA-mediated partial knockdown of SHANK3 resulted in a substantial reduction in 
TRPV1 currents in human DRG neurons. Third, Shank3 re-expression in Shank3-deficint 
DRG neurons rescued TRPV1 currents. Fourth, capsaicin-induced spontaneous pain and 
inflammation- and nerve injury-induced heat hyperalgesia are markedly reduced in Shank3 
global and conditional mutant mice. Fifth, capsaicin-induced neurogenic inflammation but 
not CFA-induced edema is abrogated in Shank3 mutant mice. Co-IP experiment further 
demonstrated possible physical interaction of SHANK3 and TRPV1 in both native DRG 
neurons and heterologous ND7/23 cells. As a scaffold protein, SHANK3 appears to control 
TRPV1 function in sensory neurons via regulating the surface expression of TRPV1. 
SHANK3 is known to interact with NMDAR and mGluR5 via PDZ and Homer binding 
motif, respectively (Sheng and Kim, 2000; Tu et al., 1999). Of great interest SHANK3

 interacts with TRPV1 via the Proline-rich region of SHANK3. This region is essential for 
the SHANK3 binding to TRPV1 and also important for regulating TRPV1 function in 
mouse and human DRG neurons. Consistently, an ASD-associated human mutation 
(InsG3680), which generates a truncated protein ending of SHANK3 in this region (Durand 
et al., 2007), also disrupted the TRPV1 function in DRG neurons. Future studies are 
warranted to determine the specific sequences on both proteins that are responsible for the 
SHANK3/TRPV1 interaction.
Our results also show that neuronal excitability did not change after Shank3 deficiency in 
DRG neurons, suggesting that SHANK3 specifically regulates the transduction but not the 
conduction of pain in primary sensory neurons. In addition to capsaicin-induced pain and 
injury-induced heat hyperalgesia, basal heat sensitivity in all the tests was impaired in 
homozygous CKO mice but not global knockout mice. This discrepancy suggests that 
peripheral and central SHANK3 may regulate heat sensitivity in a different even opposite 
way. A deficit in peripheral heat transduction could be masked by enhanced central 
processing of heat signaling in global KO mice. It is conceivable that loss of TRPV1 
function in Shank3-deficient sensory neurons is responsible for this altered heat sensitivity 
in CKO mice. SHANK3 may also regulate additional thermal sensors or signaling molecules 
in the PNS and CNS. Notably, TRPV1 primarily regulates heat hyperalgesia after tissue 
injury but only has a partial role in heat-induced nociceptive responses (Caterina et al., 2000; 
Davis et al., 2000). Apart from TRPV1, several thermal sensors have been implicated in 
extreme heat (TRPV2) and painful heat such as TRPM3 and calcium-activated chloride 
channel anoctamin 1 (ANO1) (Caterina et al., 1999; Cho et al., 2012; Vriens et al., 2011). 
By contrast, cold sensitivity and TRPM8 function do not change in Shank3 KO and CKO 
mice.
Presynaptic modulation of pain by SHANK3
Almost all SHANK3-related studies focus on postsynaptic mechanisms in the brain. 
Strikingly, we saw prominent SHANK3 expression in central terminals in the superficial 
dorsal horn. These SHANK3-expressing axonal terminals are presynaptic components of the 
first-order nociceptive synapses that co-express TRPV1 (Todd, 2010). The presynaptic 
expression of SHANK3 is also supported by the evidence that SHANK3-IR is dramatically 
reduced in the superficial dorsal horn after C-fiber ablation and Shank3 deletion in primary 
sensory neurons. As a functional measurement of presynaptic modulation, TRPV1-
medicated mEPSC frequency increase in spinal lamina IIo neurons is substantially reduced 
in Shank3 mutant mice. Spinal TRPV1 was also implicated in the generation of mechanical 
allodynia (Eskander et al., 2015; Kim et al., 2012). Consistently, mechanical allodynia after 
CFA and CCI was partially reduced in Shank3 mutant mice. However, defect in heat 
hyperalgesia is the primary phenotype in these mice. Heat hyperalgesia can be regulated by 
both peripheral and central TRPV1. Inflammation not only induces heat hyperalgesia but 
also increases TRPV1 expression in DRG neurons and axonal transport of TRPV1 to skin 
nerve terminals (Ji et al., 2002). SHANK3 is also present in axonal terminals and 
presynaptic components of hippocampal neurons (Halbedl et al., 2016), but the function of 
this presynaptic SHANK3 was not investigated in this study. Remarkably, deletion of the 
autism gene Mecp2 in DRG mechanosensory neurons results in loss of prespresynaptic

 inhibition in the spinal cord, tactile hypersensitivity, and behavioral phenotypes of ASD 
(Orefice et al., 2016). It remains to be investigated if spinal inhibitory synaptic transmission 
is also altered after SHANK3 deficiency.
Concluding remarks
Abnormal sensory integration is commonly associated with ASD patients and significantly 
affect the life quality of the individuals. Pain in ASD patients is difficult to assess in part due 
to their deficits in communication. It is generally believed that ASDs are a group of 
developmental brain disorders due to dysregulation of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic 
transmission in the cortex (Jiang and Ehlers, 2013; Tabuchi et al., 2007). However, 
peripheral and presynaptic mechanisms of ASDs have begun to be revealed (Orefice et al., 
2016). It is conceivable that different autism genes in sensory neurons may regulate different 
sensory modalities, such as pain and touch by Shank3 and Mecp2, respectively. Remarkably, 
SHANK3 deletion in PMS results in high pain threshold in 77% patients (P=0.0256), and 
high pain tolerance is becoming more common with increased age (89%, P=0.00037). PMS 
patients also exhibit significant self-injury behaviors such as biting (46%, P=0.0006) and 
hair pulling (41%, P=0.0163) but insignificant touch hypersensitivity (46%, P=0.699) 
(Sarasua et al., 2014).
Using the newly generated Shank3 complete knockout mice with deletion of exons 4 to 22 
(Wang et al., 2016), we have demonstrated that like human SHANK3 deficiency, 
haploinsufficiency of Shank3 in mice leads to substantial impairment in TRPV1 function 
and heat hyperalgesia, and these deficits can be reproduced by Shank3 deletion in mouse 
and human sensory neurons. Our data strongly suggest a peripheral mechanism of ASDs by 
which SHANK3 expression in primary sensory DRG neurons controls the surface 
expression and function of TRPV1 to regulate heat pain transduction and heat hyperalgesia 
associated inflammatory and neuropathic pain. Our results also revealed a presynaptic 
mechanism of SHANK3 by which SHANK3 expression in superficial spinal presynaptic 
terminals controls TRPV1-mediated neurotransmitter release in spinal cord pain circuit 
under injury conditions. Thus, our findings have offered a mechanistic insight into pain 
deficits in ASDs. On the other hand, targeting peripheral SHANK3 may also help alleviate 
chronic pain in non-ASD patients.
Given an important role of SHANK3 in postsynaptic modulation of glutamatergic synaptic 
transmission and well-demonstrated role of spinal cord postsynaptic plasticity in driving 
central sensitization and chronic pain (Ji et al., 2003), SHANK3 could also contribute to 
enhanced pain states after inflammation and nerve injury via modulating postsynaptic 
plasticity in spinal cord dorsal horn neurons. Therefore, SHANK3 modulates inflammatory 
and neuropathic pain via peripheral, presynaptic, and postsynaptic mechanisms. However, 
defects in heat transduction and heat hyperalgesia in Shank3 mutant mice could be primarily 
mediated by peripheral SHANK3 via its interaction with TRPV1.

 EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Reagents
We purchased capsaicin and complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA), menthol, and gadolinium 
chloride from Sigma-Aldrich, siRNA from Origene, resiniferatoxin from LC Laboratories, 
and ProTx-II from Peptide institute, Inc (Osaka, Japan).
Animals
Shank3 complete knockout mice (exons 4 to 22 deletion, Δe4–22 −/−, C57BL/6 background) 
and Shank3flox/fllox mice (RRID: MGI:5800311) were generated at Duke University Medical 
Center (Wang et al., 2016). Nav1.8-cre; Shank3flox/flox mice were generated by mating 
Nav1.8-cre mice with Shank3flox/flox mice (RRID: MGI: 5800310). Adult male C57BL/6 
mice (8–12 weeks) were used for behavioral and biochemical studies. Young C57BL/6 mice 
(5–8 weeks) were used for electrophysiological studies in spinal cord slices. All the animal 
procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care & Use Committee (IACUC) of 
Duke University. See Supplemental Experimental Procedures for details.
Animal models of pain and intrathecal injection
To produce inflammatory pain, diluted CFA (20 µl) was injected into the plantar surface of a 
hindpaw. To produce chronic constriction injury (CCI) in mice, 3 loose silk ligatures were 
tied around the sciatic nerve. Capsaicin was injected via intraplantar (3 or 10 µg) or 
intrathecal route (0.5 µg) to induce spontaneous pain. For intrathecal injection, spinal cord 
puncture was made with a 30G needle. See Supplemental Experimental Procedures for 
details.
Behavioral testing
Capsaicin-induced spontaneous pain was assessed by counting the time (seconds) spent on 
flicking, biting, and flinching for the first 5 min after the injection. Mechanical sensitivity 
was tested with von Frey hairs and thermal sensitivity was tested using Hargreaves 
apparatus. Two temperature choice test was used to assess temperature preference. Cold 
allodynia was assessed by acetone test. See Supplemental Experimental Procedures for 
details.
Whole-cell patch clamp recordings in dissociated mouse DRG neurons
DRGs were aseptically removed from mice and digested with collagenase and dispase-II for 
120 min. Cells were placed on glass cover slips coated with poly-D-lysine and grown in a 
neurobasal defined medium for 24 h before experiments. Whole-cell voltage- and current-
clamp recordings were performed at 28°C to measure capsaicin-induced currents, transient 
sodium currents and action potentials, respectively. See Supplemental Experimental 
Procedures for details.
Whole-cell patch clamp recordings in dissociated human DRG neurons
Non-diseased human DRGs were obtained from National Disease Research Interchange 
(NDRI). Postmortem L3–L5 DRGs were dissected from six donors and delivered in ice-cold

 culture medium. Human DRG cultures were prepared as previously reported (Xu et al., 
2015). DRGs were digested for 120 min with collagenase Type II and dispase II. DRG 
neurons were plated on poly-D-lysine–coated glass coverslips and grown in Neurobasal 
medium. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in small (<50 µm) human DRG neurons were 
conducted at room temperature. See Supplemental Experimental Procedures for details.
Spinal cord slice preparation and patch clamp recordings
The L3-L5 lumbar spinal cord segment was removed from mice under urethane anesthesia 
(1.5 −2.0 g/kg, i.p.) and kept in pre-oxygenated ice-cold artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) 
solution. Transverse slices (300–400 mm) were cut on a vibrating microslicer. The whole 
cell patch-clamp recordings were made from lamina IIo neurons in voltage clamp mode to 
record spontaneous EPSCs (sEPSCs) and miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs). See Supplemental 
Experimental Procedures for details.
Immunohistochemistry in rodent and human tissues
Animals were perfused through the ascending aorta with 4% paraformaldehyde. Spinal cord, 
skin DRG, and nerve sections were cut in a cryostat. The sections were blocked with 2% 
goat or horse serum and then incubated overnight at 4°C with primary antibodies followed 
by Cy3- or FITC-conjugated secondary antibodies. Human DRGs were fixed in 4% 
paraformaldehyde for 24 h and processed for immunofluorescence. See Supplemental 
Experimental Procedures for details.
Cell culture and transfection
ND7/23 cells were cultured in high glucose DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine 
serum. Transfection was performed with LipofectamineTM 2000 Reagent. For 
electroporation, freshly disassociated mouse or human DRG neurons were transfected with 
4D–Nucleofector™ System (Lonza). For siRNA transfection, 100 pmol siRNA was mixed 
with 5 pmol siGLO control and 1.5 ml TransIT®-2020 Transfection Reagent (Mirus). See 
Supplemental Experimental Procedures for details.
Immunoprecipitation
Transfected ND7/23 cells or cultured primary DRG neurons were lysed in ice-cold 
immunoprecipitation buffer. The lysate was immunoprecipitated with 0.5 mg of a rabbit 
anti-GFP antibody or goat anti-TRPV1 antibody and then incubated with protein G-
Sepharose beads (Roche). See Supplemental Experimental Procedures for details.
Surface protein biotinylation
Plasma membrane protein expression was detected after protein biotinylation. Solubilized 
lysates were pulled down on Streptavidin Agarose Resin overnight on rotor at 4°C. The 
pellet was then incubated in SDS-PAGE loading buffer and sample buffer for Western blot 
analysis. See Supplemental Experimental Procedures for details.
