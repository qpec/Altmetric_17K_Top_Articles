Therapies to prevent maternal Zika virus (ZIKV) infection and its subsequent fetal developmental complications
are urgently required. We isolated three potent ZIKV-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (nmAbs) from the plasma-
blasts of a ZIKV-infected patient—SMZAb1, SMZAb2, and SMZAb5—directed against two different domains of the
virus. We engineered these nmAbs with Fc LALA mutations that abrogate Fcg receptor binding, thus eliminating
potential therapy-mediated antibody-dependent enhancement. We administered a cocktail of these three nmAbs
to nonhuman primates 1 day before challenge with ZIKV and demonstrated that the nmAbs completely prevented
viremia in serum after challenge. Given that numerous antibodies have exceptional safety profiles in humans, the
cocktail described here could be rapidly developed to protect uninfected pregnant women and their fetuses.
INTRODUCTION
Zika virus (ZIKV) infection is a serious global public health threat with
the potential to affect millions of individuals (1–4). Several locations will
remain susceptible to yearly ZIKV outbreaks, and new regions of the
world will likely experience epidemics similar to the one described in
South America in 2016. Developing novel preventive therapies will be
central to limiting complications associated with the future epidemics. Of
particularconcernisthelinkbetweenZIKVinfectionofpregnantwomen
andabnormalfetaldevelopment(1–3).Prophylaxisusingantibodiescon-
stitutes a well-established class of clinical intervention, including prevent-
ative and therapeutic uses in expectant mothers and premature infants
(5, 6). The administration of human neutralizing monoclonal antibodies
(nmAbs) in pregnant women to prevent ZIKV infection could be es-
peciallybeneficialbecausetheyaregenerallyconsideredsafeandmaternal
antibodies cross the placenta and are the predominant means of fetal im-
munity (7). Thus, a passively administered appropriately engineered
human nmAb may be able to protect a fetus from ZIKV infection. nmAb
therapy is therefore likely to be one of the most promising interventions
to prevent and treat ZIKV infection during pregnancy.
RESULTS
To isolate candidate potent nmAb for use in passive transfer therapies,
we cloned antibody genes from blood-derived plasmablasts of a ZIKV-
infected subject from Colombia in the acute phase. After individual
amplification of the heavy (H) and light (L) chains from the isolated
B cells, we expressed and purified 91 mAbs. These mAbs were tested
for neutralization, and 11 of them reduced ZIKV infection by greater
than 80% at 1 mg ml−1 (fig. S1). Because our long-term goal is to pre-
vent infection (or reduce viral replication) with nmAbs in humans in
resource-limited areas, we selected the three most potent nmAbs:
SMZAb1 (IGHV3-23*04 and IGKV1-5*03), SMZAb2 (IGHV1-69*01
and IGLV8-61*01), and SMZAb5 (IGHV3-23*01 and IGKV1-5*03).
The isolated nmAbs had, on average, 18% heavy chain nucleotide
mutations, with antibodies SMZAb1 and SMZAb5 both representing
related variants of the IGHV3-23 gene family. The three nmAbs have
half-maximal neutralization (Neut50) potencies of less than 500 ng ml−1
(Fig. 1 and tables S1 to S3) and were selected for in vivo studies so that
antiviral effects would be achieved at low concentrations in vivo and
nmAb costs would be minimized.
The ZIKV E protein is the main target of nmAbs and contains three
domains, with most of the anti-ZIKV nmAb targeting either domain III
or the fusion loop epitope in domain II (8). We screened our three
most potent nmAbs for their ability to recognize different regions of
the ZIKV E protein in domain binding experiments (fig. S2). We
used a domain III protein binding enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA) to identify nmAbs that target this domain. We also
used a mAb competition assay to evaluate mAbs, which target epi-
topes that overlap with the fusion loop epitope targeted by the well-
characterized anti-flavivirus mAb, 4G2 (clone D1-4G2-4-15 MAB10216,
MilliporeSigma). On the basis of these analyses, we demonstrated
that our three most potent nmAbs bind to two different regions of
the virus; SMZAb1 and SMZAb5 bind domain III, and SMZAb2
binds domain II.
Flaviviruses are RNA viruses and have been shown to readily escape
nmAb therapy (9, 10). To avoid this possible outcome, we screened our
three nmAbs for their ability to select for escape mutants in vitro using
previously published protocols (11).
Because our nmAbs showed some cross-reactivity with dengue
virus (DENV) (figs. S3 and S4), we engineered them to prevent any

 potential antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) effects in future
applications by incorporating the L234A and L235A (LALA) immu-
noglobulin G (IgG1) mutations, which reduce or prevent Fc-g receptor
(FcgR) binding (12). We then produced large quantities of the nmAbs
by transfection of mammalian cells and subsequent purification. We
retested our three LALA-modified nmAbs before infusion in two dif-
ferent neutralization assays and determined that they all neutralized
ZIKV with Neut50 and 50% plaque reduction neutralization test
(PRNT50) values in the nanogram per milliliter range (tables S1
and S3).
We next tested the ability of the nmAbs to protect against ZIKV
infection in eight Indian rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) (table S4).
We recently developed a nonhuman primate (NHP) ZIKV macaque
challenge model using a low-passage primary isolate (Rio U-1 2016),
recovered from the urine of a pregnant woman during the 2016 outbreak
in Rio de Janeiro (13). In our first experimental group (group 1; Fig. 2A)
of four macaques, we delivered a cocktail of SMZAb1, SMZAb2, and
SMZAb5 at 20 mg kg−1 (of each nmAb) to achieve plasma levels ex-
ceeding 1000× the Neut50 of each nmAb. We also delivered the same
dose of a human IgG1 isotype control (wild-type), CB1 (cannabinoid
receptor type 1), to four control macaques (group 2; Fig. 2A). We then
challenged the macaques subcutaneously with 1000 plaque-forming
units (PFU) of our low-passage primary isolate ZIKV stock 1 day after
passive transfer. Because the actual amount of ZIKV delivered to
humans during mosquito feeding is unknown (14), we chose an in-
fectious dose similar to that which has been recently used in ZIKV

 vaccination and challenge experiments in NHPs (15, 16). After in-
fusion, we monitored mAb levels using an antibody ELISA. Levels
of our nmAbs averaged about 600 mg ml−1 at day of challenge and
about 500 mg ml−1 at day 7 after challenge, well above 1000× the
Neut50 of these potent nmAbs (Fig. 2, B and C). We also monitored
serum neutralizing activity on the day of challenge and demon-
strated that sera from the macaques infused with our ZIKV-specific
nmAbs neutralized ZIKV at a dilution of about 1:50,000 (Fig. 2, D
and E, and fig. S5).
Our nmAb cocktail appeared to confer sterilizing immunity on
the four treated macaques. To determine whether our nmAbs had
blocked ZIKV infection in the group 1 animals, we measured serum viral
concentrations by quantitative real-time
reverse transcription polymerase chain
reaction (qRT-PCR) and plaque assay
from day 0 to day 21 after challenge. Our
ZIKV-specific nmAb cocktail complete-
ly prevented viral replication in all four
nmAb-treated macaques in group 1 (Fig.
3A and table S5). Because occult viral rep-
licationcanoccurin theabsenceof plasma
viremia, we then tested macaque IgG and
IgM responses against ZIKV in the treat-
ed and control animals. We could find no
evidence for any ZIKV-specific antibody
responses against either NS1 or whole
virus in the nmAb-treated macaques (Fig.
3B). As expected, the control macaques
mounted robust ZIKV-specific IgG and
IgM responses (Fig. 3B).
DISCUSSION
ADE is a serious technical hurdle to the
development of vaccines against flaviviruses
like ZIKV (17). Specially engineered
nmAbs would avoid this unfortunate con-
sequence of vaccination. ADE has been
well described in the setting of DENV
(18, 19), where subneutralizing concen-
trations of neutralizing antibodies via
an FcgR-mediated mechanism (20) bind
viral particles and direct them to cells of
the myeloid lineage. ADE can transform a
secondary DENV infection into potential-
ly fatal hemorrhagic fever (21), and anti-
DENV oranti-WNV (WestNilevirus)sera
can enhance ZIKV infection in vivo (22). It
has already been established that immune
responses against ZIKV and DENV cross-
react (8, 23, 24), raising the possibility that
a vaccine for one of these viruses could re-
sult in a poor outcome after infection with
another. It is also of concern that individ-
uals with a diminished immune response
against a ZIKV vaccine run the risk of a
much more severe ZIKV (or DENV) in-
fection. For this reason, and others, it will
take a number of years of testing before a
ZIKV vaccine can safely be administered to women of childbearing
age. Additionally, millions of individuals in an at-risk area would
have to volunteer to be vaccinated to provide sufficient herd immu-
nity to limit ZIKV-caused birth defects. Recombinant nmAbs can be
engineered through well-established procedures to both avoid ADE
and increase their half-lives by more than threefold, resulting in effi-
cacious levels of mAbs for more than 6 months after a single injection
of mAb (25). Thus, the quickest and most effective way to prevent fetal
defects caused by ZIKV may be to develop human nmAbs or cocktails
of these nmAbs that can be administered to pregnant women. Although
other antibodies have shown some degree of efficacy in preventing or
limiting mouse ZIKV infections (26), they remain to be evaluated in

 NHP models that can recapitulate essential aspects of human ZIKV
pathology. The coformulation of three antibodies that include epi-
tope specificity for both domains II and III was selected to reduce
the probability of ZIKV E protein escape variants. In this NHP study,
we observed no evidence of viral replication in vivo and therefore are
hopeful that the delivery of these three antibodies in humans as a ZIKV
preventative therapy would prevent the generation of viral escape as
well. It should be noted, however, that our nmAb cocktail was not tested
in pregnant NHPs. Thus, the nmAb cocktail described here warrants
additional preclinical testing in pregnant macaques as a strategy to
prevent fetal defects caused by ZIKV infection.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design
Wehavetestedthe hypothesisthat acocktailof threeZIKV-neutralizing
antibodies is sufficient for preventing ZIKV infection in rhesus ma-
caques. A control group and a test group of four macaques each were
used in this efficacy experiment. Macaques were selected on the basis
of availability and were not randomized during assignment. Because
the supply of mAbs was limited, we selected the lighter macaques to
receive the SMZAbs. The primary outcome measured was the presence
of viral RNA (vRNA) in serum, performed in two independent assays.
Primary data are given in tables S5 and S6.
Human research
Preexisting blood samples were obtained through Antibody Systems
Inc. under The Scripps Research Institute IRB-15-6683. Research on
human subjects was conducted in compliance with existing regula-
tions relating to the protection of human subjects. All human
subjects were consented, and all specimens, data, and human subject
research were gathered by Antibody Systems Inc.
Animal experiments
The eight Indian rhesus macaques (M. mulatta) used in this study were
housed at the Yerkes National Primate Research Center (YNPRC). The
YNPRC is fully accredited by Association for the Assessment and
Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International, Animal
Welfare Assurance No. A3180-01. Animals were cared for in accordance
with the National Research Council Guide for the Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals, and the Animal Welfare Act Animal experiments
were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
of Emory University (protocol YER-2003415). The macaques were
separated in two groups as follows: group 1 (SMZAb cocktail, n = 4)
and group 2 (isotype control mAb, n = 4). The mAb cocktail was pre-
pared in saline bags and administered intravenously into each animal.
All animals were challenged 1 day after mAb administration with 1 ×
103 PFU of ZIKV Rio U-1 2016 delivered subcutaneously. After the
challenge, we collected serum at the indicated time points to measure
viremia, mAb levels, and seroconversion.
Viruses
ZIKV strain Rio U-1 2016 was isolated in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in 2016
(KU926309). Viral challenge stocks were prepared by propagating the
virus in Vero cells for two passages after virus isolation (13). Virus con-
centrations in the stocks were quantitated by viral plaque assay. The
viral stocks were diluted in Leibovitz′s L-15 and SPG media as de-
scribed previously (27). DENV1 (West Pac74; U88535.1), DENV2
(NewGuineaC; AF038403.1), DENV3 (Sleman/78; AY648961), DENV4
(Dominica/8129; AF326573.1), ZIKV (MR766; AY632535.2), and ZIKV
(Paraiba/2015; KX280026) were propagated in Vero cells (American
Type Culture Collection) and used for binding virus capture assays
(VCAs) and neutralization assays as described below.
mAb isolation and screening
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated as previously de-
scribed (28). Plasmablasts were sorted into 96-well plates by flow cy-
tometry by sorting for CD3− CD19+ CD20low CD38hi CD27hi cells.
The sorts were at a density of one cell per well for antibody chain
pairing. Reverse transcription and PCR amplification of heavy and
light chain variable genes were performed, and the antibodies were
assembled for each source cell.
Focus reduction neutralization test
Virus-specific neutralizing antibody responses were titrated essentially
as previously described (29). Briefly, plasma or antibody was serially
diluted in minimal essential medium (MEM) (Corning Cellgro) con-
taining 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco-Invitrogen)
and incubated for 1 hour at 37°C with virus. After incubation, the
antibody-virus or plasma-virus mixture was added in triplicate to
96-well plates containing 80% confluent monolayers of Vero E6 cells.
Plates were incubated for 1.5 hours at 37°C. After incubation, wells
were overlaid with 1% methylcellulose in supplemented MEM with
2% heat-inactivated FBS (Gibco-Invitrogen) and 1:100 Hepes. Plates
were incubated at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 40 hours, after which cells were
fixed and permeabilized with Perm/Wash buffer (BD Biosciences) for
5 min. After permeabilization, cells were incubated with 1:2000 di-
lution of anti-flavivirus antibody (MAB10216, EMD Millipore) for
2 hours and then washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Af-
ter washing, cells were incubated with anti-mouse horseradish perox-
idase (HRP)–conjugated secondary antibody (115035146, Jackson
ImmunoResearch Laboratories) in Perm/Wash buffer for 2 hours.
After washing of cells with PBS, plates were developed with peroxi-
dase substrate (KPL). The endpoint titer was determined to be the
highest dilution with a 50% reduction (IC50) in the number of pla-
ques compared to control wells.
Plaque reduction neutralization test
PRNTs were conducted as previously described (27). Briefly, serum
samples were serially diluted in 199 media supplemented with 2%
human serum albumin, 5% FBS, and gentamicin. ZIKV was diluted
to a final concentration of ~500 to 1000 PFU ml−1 in the same diluent
and added to equal volumes of the diluted sample. The virus-serum mix-
ture was incubated at 37°C for 60 min. Cell culture medium was re-
moved from 90% confluent monolayer cultures of Vero cells on 24-well
plates, and 100 ml of the virus per mAb mixture was transferred onto
duplicate cellmonolayers. Cell monolayers were incubated for 60 min at
37°C and overlaid with 1% methylcellulose in Opti-MEM (Thermo
Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 2% FBS, 2 mM glutamine, and
gentamicin (50 mg ml−1). Samples were incubated at 37°C for 4 days,
after which plaques were visualized by immunoperoxidase staining
and PRNT50 was calculated.
Flow cytometry–based neutralization assay
The neutralizing potency of the mAbs was measured using a flow
cytometry–based assay (30, 31). Briefly, recombinant mAbs were di-
luted and preincubated with ZIKV (Paraiba 2015, KX280026.1) in a
final volume of 220 ml for 1 hour at 37°C. The virus and mAb mixture

 (100 ml) was added onto wells of a 24-well plate of 100% confluent
Vero cell monolayers in duplicate. The inoculum was incubated in a
37°C incubator at 5% CO2 for 1 hour with agitation of the plates every
15 min. After 1 hour, the virus and mAb-containing supernatants were
aspirated and the wells were washed with media. Fresh media were then
added, and the plates were incubated for a total of 24 hours. Cells were
trypsinized with 0.5% trypsin (Life Technologies), fixed (BD Cytofix),
and permeabilized (BD Cytoperm). Viral infection was detected with
the 4G2 antibody recognizing ZIKV or DENV, followed by staining
with an anti-mouse IgG2a-allophycocyanin fluorophore-conjugated
secondary reagent (BioLegend). Neut50 was calculated using a nonlinear
regression analysis with Prism 7.0 software (GraphPad Software). The
ZIKV Paraiba 2015 strain was used in our neutralization assays.
Virus capture assay
Antibody binding to whole virus was determined in a side-by-side
DENV1, DENV2, DENV3, DENV4, and ZIKV VCA ELISA. The
ELISA plate was coated with the mouse anti-flavivirus mAb 4G2
diluted 1:1000 in carbonate binding buffer and incubated overnight
at 4°C. The next day, the plate was washed five times with PBS–
Tween 20, and the wells were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in
PBS for 1 hour at 37°C. After the block, the plate was washed and
each virus was added to the corresponding VCA wells and incubated
for 1 hour at room temperature. Subsequently, the plate was washed
with PBS, and mAbs from different time points diluted in 5% nonfat
dry milk with PBS were added to designated wells and incubated for
1 hour at 37°C. After sample addition, plates were washed and de-
tection was carried out using one of the following antibodies: goat anti-
human IgG-HRP (1:10,000 dilution; 2045-05, SouthernBiotech), mouse
anti-monkey IgG-HRP (1:4000 dilution; 4700-05, SouthernBiotech),
or goat anti-human IgM-HRP (1:2000 dilution; 2023-05, SouthernBiotech).
The diluted detection antibody was added to all wells and incubated for
1 hour at 37°C. The plate was then washed, and the wells were devel-
oped with the tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate at room tempera-
ture for 3 to 4 min. The reaction was then stopped with the TMB
solution, and absorbance was read at 450 nm.
NS1 ELISA
ZIKV-NS1–specific antibodies in serum were detected by ELISA. To
begin, the plate was coated with ZIKV-NS1 antigen (MBS568704,
MyBioSource) diluted to 10 mg ml−1 in carbonate binding buffer and
incubated overnight at 4°C. The following day, the plate was washed five
times with PBS–Tween 20 and all wells were blocked with 5% nonfat
dry milk in PBS for 1 hour at 37°C. After the block, the plate was
washed, and serum samples diluted 1:100 were added to corresponding
wells and incubated for 1 hour at 37°C. Subsequently, the plate was
washed five times, and IgG or IgM detection was carried out. ZIKV-
NS1–specific rhesus IgG and IgM were detected using the mouse anti-
monkey IgG-HRP (1:4000 dilution; 4700-05, Southern Biotech) and
the goat anti-human IgM-HRP (1:2000 dilution; 2023-05, Southern Bio-
tech), respectively. The diluted detection antibodies were added to
corresponding wells and incubated for 1 hour at 37°C. The plate was then
washed eight times and developed with TMB substrate at room tempera-
ture for 2 to 3 min. The reaction was then stopped with TMB stop solu-
tion, and the absorbance was read at 450 nm.
In vivo human antibody quantitation by ELISA
The presence of the recombinant nmAbs in sera was quantitated with
an ELISA specific for human antibodies. Briefly, 96-well ELISA plates
were coated overnight with the monkey antibody-adsorbed goat anti-
human IgG (5 mg ml−1; 2049-01, Southern Biotech) diluted in PBS. Each
plate was washed with PBS–Tween 20, and the wells were blocked with
5% nonfat dry milk in PBS for 1 hour at 37°C. Subsequently, the plate
was washed with PBS and serum samples were added to designated
wells. After 1 hour of incubation at 37°C, the plate was washed and de-
tection was carried out using an HRP-conjugated goat anti-human IgG
(2045-05, Southern Biotech), which was added to all wells at a dilution
of 1:10,000. After 1 hour of incubation at 37°C, the plate was washed
with PBS–Tween 20 and developed with TMB substrate (Millipore) at
room temperature for 3 to 4 min. Reaction was then stopped with TMB
stop solution, and absorbance was read at 450 nm.
Measurement of vRNA load (qRT-PCR)
The assay for the quantification of viral loads in sera was based on a
previously validated qRT-PCR assay (32, 33). Briefly, RNA was ex-
tracted from 280 ml of frozen sera using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini
Kit (Qiagen). The total nucleic acid was eluted in two centrifugation
steps with 40 ml of Buffer AVE each. A qRT-PCR was then carried
out with 20 ml of samples and 10 ml of primer, probes, and TaqMan Fast
Virus 1-Step Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). We used precombined
probe and primers (500 nM primers and 250 nM probe; IDT Technol-
ogies). The primer and probe sequences were designed to match se-
quences to the ZIKV isolate (KU926309) and were as follows: primer
1, 5′-TTGAAGAGGCTGCCAGC-3′; primer 2, 5′-CCCACTGA-
ACCCCATCTATTG-3′; and probe, 5′-TGAGACCCAGT-
GATGGCTTGATTGC-3′. The probe was double-quenched (ZEN/
Iowa Black FQ) and labeled with the FAM dye (IDT Technologies).
Tenfold serial dilutions of in vitro transcript RNA starting at about 5 ×
105 copies ml−1 were used as standards, and results were reported as the
equivalent vRNA genomes per milliliter.
Measurement of viral load (plaque)
Quantification of ZIKV PFU in serum was determined as described
before for PRNT, without the antibody incubation step.
Domain III binding ELISA
The domain specificity of our recombinant nmAbs was determined
using Zika domain III recombinant protein ELISA. Ninety-six–well
high-binding plates were coated overnight with Zika domain III re-
combinant protein (5 mg ml−1), supplied by D. Fremont and previously
described (34), diluted in PBS. Each plate was washed three times with
PBS–Tween 20, and the wells were blocked with 3% bovine serum al-
bumin (BSA) in water for 1.5 hours at room temperature. Subsequently,
the plate was washed three times with PBS–Tween 20, and our recom-
binant nmAbs were added to their designated wells at starting concen-
trations of 50 mg ml−1 with subsequent sixfold dilutions. After 1.5 hours
of incubation at room temperature, the plate was washed and detection
was carried out using anti-human IgG-AP (109055098, Jackson
ImmunoResearch Laboratories), which was added to all wells at a
dilution of 1:2000. After 1 hour of incubation at room temperature,
the plate was washed and developed with phosphatase substrate
(MilliporeSigma) at room temperature. The plates were immediately
read at 405 nm, with 5-min incubations at room temperature be-
tween reads.
4G2 mAb competition ELISA
To further determine the domain specificity of our recombinant nmAbs,
a competition ELISA was performed. Plates were coated overnight with

 ZIKV Envelope protein (2 mg ml−1) (ZIKV-SU-ENV100, Native Anti-
gen) diluted in PBS. Each plate was washed three times with PBS–Tween
20, and the wells were blocked with 3% BSA in water for 1.5 hours at
room temperature. Subsequently, the plate was washed three times with
PBS–Tween 20, and antibodies, 4G2 and a known domain III binding
mAb characterized in our laboratory, ADI24255, were added to their
designated wells at concentrations of 25 mg ml−1 with subsequent 10-fold
dilutions (35). After 1.5 hours of incubation at room temperature, the
plate was washed and our previously biotinylated nmAbs (EZ-LINK
NHS-Biotin, Thermo Fisher Scientific) were added to their designated
wells. After 1.5 hours of incubation at room temperature, the plate
was washed and alkaline phosphatase–conjugated streptavidin (016-
059-084, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) was added to all
wells at a dilution of 1:2000. After 1 hour of incubation at room tem-
perature, the plate was washed and developed with phosphatase sub-
strate (MilliporeSigma) at room temperature. The plates were immediately
read at 405 nm, with 5-min incubations at room temperature be-
tween reads.
Statistics
The main outcome measure in this study is the viremia levels on mAb-
treated and control animals. We did not perform statistical compari-
sons, because there was no virus detected in any of the treated animals
and all controls got infected.
