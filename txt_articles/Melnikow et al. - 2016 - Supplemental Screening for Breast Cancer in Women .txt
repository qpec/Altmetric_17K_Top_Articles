Background: Screening mammography has lower sensitivity
and specificity in women with dense breasts, who experience
higher breast cancer risk.
Purpose: To perform a systematic review of reproducibility of
Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) density
categorization and test performance and clinical outcomes of
supplemental screening with breast ultrasonography, magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI), and digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT)
in women with dense breasts and negative mammography
results.
Data Sources: MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane
database from January 2000 to July 2015.
Study Selection: Studies reporting BI-RADS density reproduc-
ibility or supplemental screening results for women with dense
breasts.
Data Extraction: Quality assessment and abstraction of 24
studies from 7 countries; 6 studies were good-quality.
Data Synthesis: Three good-quality studies reported reproduc-
ibility of BI-RADS density; 13% to 19% of women were recatego-
rized between “dense” and “nondense” at subsequent screen-
ing. Two good-quality studies reported that sensitivity of
ultrasonography for women with negative mammography re-
sults ranged from 80% to 83%; specificity, from 86% to 94%; and
positive predictive value (PPV), from 3% to 8%. The sensitivity of
MRI ranged from 75% to 100%; specificity, from 78% to 94%;
and PPV, from 3% to 33% (3 studies). Rates of additional cancer
detection with ultrasonography were 4.4 per 1000 examinations
(89% to 93% invasive); recall rates were 14%. Use of MRI de-
tected 3.5 to 28.6 additional cancer cases per 1000 examina-
tions (34% to 86% invasive); recall rates were 12% to 24%. Rates
of cancer detection with DBT increased by 1.4 to 2.5 per 1000
examinations compared with mammography alone (3 studies).
Recall rates ranged from 7% to 11%, compared with 7% to 17%
with mammography alone. No studies examined breast cancer
outcomes.
Limitations: Good-quality evidence was sparse. Studies were
small and CIs were wide. Definitions of recall were absent or
inconsistent.
Conclusion: Density ratings may be recategorized on serial
screening mammography. Supplemental screening of women
with dense breasts finds additional breast cancer but increases
false-positive results. Use of DBT may reduce recall rates. Effects
of supplemental screening on breast cancer outcomes remain
unclear.

D
ense breasts are defined by mammographic ap-
pearance. The American College of Radiology'
s
(ACR'
s) Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-
RADS) classifies breasts as almost entirely fatty (BI-
RADS category a), scattered areas of fibroglandular
density (category b), heterogeneously dense (category
c), or extremely dense (category d).
About 27.6 million (43%) women aged 40 to 74
years in the United States have dense breasts; most of
these are classified as category c (1). Higher breast
density is associated with decreased mammographic
sensitivity and specificity and also with increased breast
cancer risk. The relative hazard of breast cancer for
women with dense breasts ranged from 1.50 (women
aged 65 to 74 years) to 1.83 (women aged 40 to 49
years) in an analysis of 1 169 248 women enrolled in
the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium (unpub-
lished data). Increased breast density has been associ-
ated with hormone replacement therapy use, younger
age, and lower body mass index (2). Data on breast
density and race or ethnicity are limited. In the United
States, Asian women have higher breast density (3) but
lower than average incidence of breast cancer (4). In-
creased breast density is not associated with higher
breast cancer mortality among women with dense
breasts diagnosed with breast cancer, after adjustment
for stage and mode of detection (5).
Supplemental breast cancer screening with addi-
tional screening modalities has been proposed to im-
prove the early detection of breast cancers. No clinical
guidelines explicitly recommend use of supplemental
breast cancer screening on women with dense breasts
(6–9), but as of September 2015, 24 states had enacted
legislation requiring that women be notified of breast
density with their mammography results; 9 more states
are considering mandatory notification (10) (Appendix

 Table 1, available at www.annals.org). Most states re-
quire specific language distinguishing dense (BI-RADS
c and d) from nondense breasts, and 4 states require
that insurers cover subsequent examinations and tests
for women with dense breasts (11–14). Federal legisla-
tion requiring breast density notification is pending
(15).
This report summarizes a systematic review of cur-
rent evidence on the reproducibility of BI-RADS breast
density determinations and on test performance char-
acteristics and outcomes of supplemental screening of
women with dense breasts by using hand-held ultra-
sonography (HHUS), automated whole-breast ultra-
sonography (ABUS), breast magnetic resonance imag-
ing (MRI), and digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT).
Mandatory reporting laws frame notification of women
as dense/nondense, so this review focused on this
categorization.
METHODS
The review protocol included an analytic frame-
work with 4 key questions (KQs) (Appendix Figure 1,
available at www.annals.org). Detailed methods, includ-
ing search strategies, detailed inclusion criteria, and ex-
cluded studies, are available in the full evidence report
(16).
Data Sources and Searches
MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Li-
brary were searched for relevant English-language
studies published between January 2000 and July
2015. We reviewed reference lists from retrieved arti-
cles and references suggested by experts.
Study Selection
Two
investigators
independently
reviewed
ab-
stracts and full-text articles for inclusion according to
predetermined criteria (E.P.W. and J.H.T. for KQ 1, J.M.
and J.J.F. for KQs 2 to 4). Included studies examining
the reproducibility of BI-RADS breast density categori-
zation focused on asymptomatic women aged 40 years
or older undergoing digital or film mammography. In-
cluded studies on supplemental screening with HHUS,
ABUS, MRI, or DBT reported outcomes for asymptom-
atic women with dense breasts aged 40 years and
older. In studies that focused primarily on women at
high risk for breast cancer (including those with preex-
isting breast cancer or high-risk breast lesions [such as
ductal carcinoma in situ, atypical hyperplasia, and lob-
ular carcinoma in situ], BRCA mutations, familial breast
cancer syndromes, or previous chest-wall radiation)
and studies that included women with nondense
breasts, we analyzed the relevant subset when avail-
able in the publication or provided by the authors.
A priori inclusion criteria limited studies on BI-
RADS reproducibility to fair- or good-quality random-
ized, controlled trials; cohort studies; or test sets involv-
ing multiple blind readings by at least 3 readers.
Studies on test performance characteristics and out-
comes of supplemental screening modalities were lim-
ited to fair- or good-quality randomized, controlled tri-
als; cohort studies; or diagnostic accuracy studies with
reference standards applied to all participants. We ex-
amined sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values
(PPVs), negative predictive values (NPVs), and available
clinical outcomes (including cancer detection rates, re-
call rates, and biopsy rates). We defined recall as the
need for any additional diagnostic testing after supple-
mental screening, including imaging and biopsy.
Data Extraction and Quality Assessment
Two investigators (E.P.W. and J.H.T. for KQ 1, J.M.
and J.J.F. for KQs 2 to 4) critically appraised all in-
cluded studies independently using the U.S. Preventive
Services Task Force'
s (USPSTF'
s) design-specific criteria
(17), supplemented with the National Institute for
Health and Clinical Excellence methodology checklists
(18) and the Quality Appraisal Tool for Studies of Diag-
nostic Reliability (19). According to USPSTF criteria, a
good-quality study generally met all prespecified crite-
ria; fair-quality studies did not meet all criteria but had
no important limitations. Poor-quality studies had im-
portant limitations that could invalidate results (inade-
quate or biased application of reference standard;
population limited to very high-risk patients).
Data Synthesis and Analysis
When available or provided by the authors, results
of supplemental screening for subgroups of women
with dense breasts were extracted; we excluded those
with other risk factors for breast cancer. We calculated
the sensitivity and specificity of the supplemental
breast screening tests for women with negative mam-
mography results. Only cancers detected by the sup-
plemental test after negative mammography results
and cancers found at interval follow-up were included.
Hence, the values reported represent the sensitivity
and specificity for detection of additional cancer in
women with negative mammography findings. Simi-
larly, we defined cancer detection rates, recall rates,
and biopsy rates to include only those cancer cases,
recalls, and biopsies related to supplemental screening
after negative results on mammography. Meta-analysis
was not performed because there were few good-
quality studies.
Role of the Funding Source
This research was funded by the Agency for Health-
care Research and Quality (AHRQ) under a contract to
support the work of the USPSTF. The investigators
worked with USPSTF members to develop and refine
the scope, analytic frameworks, and KQs. AHRQ had no
role in study selection, quality assessment, synthesis, or
development of conclusions. AHRQ provided project
oversight; reviewed the draft report; and distributed
the draft for peer review, including to representatives
of professional societies and federal agencies. AHRQ
performed a final review of the manuscript to ensure
that the analysis met methodological standards. The in-
vestigators are solely responsible for the content and
the decision to submit the manuscript for publication.

 RESULTS
The literature search yielded 2067 unique citations;
128 full-text articles considered potentially relevant
were reviewed to identify 24 unique studies meeting
inclusion criteria (Appendix Figure 2, available at www
.annals.org). Table 1 (20–43) provides the characteris-
tics of included studies. No studies addressed the ef-
fect of supplemental screening (compared with women
without supplemental screening) on breast cancer
morbidity or mortality.
Accuracy and Reliability of BI-RADS Density
Determination
Absent a gold standard for breast density, studies
could not evaluate the accuracy of BI-RADS density de-
terminations. Five studies reported repeated assign-
ment of categorical BI-RADS breast density classifica-
tion by the same or different radiologists, altogether
including more than 440 000 women, almost all with
data from 2 sequential screening mammograms. To re-
flect current U.S. practice, we included only studies
based on the BI-RADS density categories. The 3 largest
studies were set in the United States. Two used data
from the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium (20,
22), and the third presented findings from community
radiologists conducting repeated readings of a large
screening test set (24). Two other small studies (not dis-
cussed here) were based on mammographic screening
programs in Spain (21) and Italy (23). All United States–
based studies reflected community practice by use of
clinical readings from community screening programs
or test set readings by practicing community radiolo-
gists without additional training.
Overall, group prevalence of BI-RADS density rat-
ings was similar across initial and subsequent examina-
tions among community radiologists (Appendix Table
2, available at www.annals.org), but there was greater
disagreement at the individual level. On subsequent
screening examinations, approximately 1 in 5 women
(23%) was placed in a different BI-RADS density cate-
gory (a, b, c, d) by the same radiologist, while approx-
imately 1 in 3 was categorized differently when a differ-
ent radiologist read the subsequent examination result
(Table 2). Considering clinical interpretations that com-
bine categories (“dense” representing those with BI-
RADS c or d and “nondense” representing BI-RADS a or
b), 13% to 19% of women were reclassified into a dif-
ferent breast density category on their subsequent
screening mammogram (Table 2).
These average estimates do not reflect greater ex-
tremes seen among outlier radiologists. Among 34

 community radiologists reading sequential examina-
tion results in the same women (22), readers assigned
the same BI-RADS density assessment on both mam-
mograms 77% of the time, on average; however, indi-
vidual readers' agreement between repeated ratings
ranged from 62% to 87% (data not shown). In a study
assessing repeat as well as cross-reader assignment of
BI-RADS density categories by 19 radiologists in a test
set of 341 examinations, radiologists assigned the
same BI-RADS density assignment 82% of the time, on
average, although individual readers varied from 66%
to 95% (24).
In community settings, 19% to 22% of examinations
initially classified as dense were subsequently reclassi-
fied as nondense, whereas 10% to 16% of initially non-
dense examinations were reclassified as dense (Table
2). In contrast, initial clinical readings for a test set
showed a higher percentage reclassified from non-
dense to dense than vice versa. Across studies, the
most commonly assigned breast density categories (b
or c) were also those most likely to be reclassified on
subsequent examination (Table 2), representing a clin-
ical reclassification between nondense and dense. Ra-
diologists tended to agree with their own previous as-
sessments of density better than with those made by
other readers, although there was substantial variability
among pairs of readers due to outliers (more details in
full report [16]). These results apply most to postmeno-
pausal women or those aged 50 years and older be-
cause these women made up 71% to 100% of the study
samples.
Test Performance Characteristics of
Supplemental Screening Technologies in Women
With Dense Breasts
Nine studies reported test performance character-
istics for supplemental screening with HHUS, ABUS,
and MRI among women with negative mammography
results (Table 2 and Appendix Figures 3 and 4, avail-
able at www.annals.org). No studies reported test per-
formance characteristics of DBT for women with dense
breasts.
HHUS and ABUS
Two good-quality studies (from the United States
[25] and Italy [26]) and 3 fair-quality studies (29, 30, 34)
reported on HHUS, and 1 fair-quality study from the
United States (37) reported on ABUS (Table 3). We
found no studies reporting variation in performance of
these modalities by patient age and other breast can-
cer risk factors among women with dense breasts. Both
good-quality studies applied consistent reference stan-
dards to identify interval cancer and included more
than 1000 women. The Italian study included women
who self-referred to a charity-funded breast clinic and
reported findings separately by breast density cate-
gory. The U.S. study included only women with dense
breasts, but many women also had additional major
risk factors. The authors provided data for the subset of
women without major risk factors. Additional details on
all included studies are found in the full report (16).
Among women with dense breasts after recent
negative results on screening mammography, the sen-
sitivity of HHUS in the 2 good-quality studies for detect-
ing all breast cancer (including ductal carcinoma in situ
and invasive cancer) ranged from 0.80 (95% CI, 0.65 to
0.91) to 0.83 (CI, 0.59 to 0.96) (25, 26), and specificity
ranged from 0.86 (CI, 0.85 to 0.88) to 0.95 (CI, 0.94 to
0.95) (25, 26). Sensitivity and specificity for invasive can-
cers were similar (25, 26). PPV in the good-quality stud-
ies ranged from 0.03 to 0.08; NPV was 0.99 (25, 26). A
single fair-quality study found that ABUS had perfor-
mance characteristics similar to those of HHUS among
women with dense breasts and negative mammogra-
phy results (37).

 MRI
Three good-quality studies (25, 38, 39) reported
test characteristics of supplemental MRI screening (Ta-
ble 3). These studies included many women with ele-
vated risk for breast cancer. In 2 studies, authors pro-
vided us with unpublished data for the subgroup of
women with dense breasts, excluding women at very
high risk because of BRCA1/2 mutations, chest radia-
tion, or personal histories of breast cancer (25, 39). In
both, women had also recently had negative findings
on screening with HHUS. The third study included strat-
ified results based on risk factors (38).
Among these subgroups of lower-risk women with
dense breasts, the sensitivity of MRI screening (after
negative mammography results) for all breast cancer
ranged across studies from 0.75 (CI, 0.35 to 0.97) to
1.00 (CI, 0.59 to 1.00) (25, 38, 39). Specificity also var-
ied, ranging from 0.78 (CI, 0.73 to 0.83) (25) to 0.93 (CI,
0.87 to 0.97) (39). PPV ranged from 0.03 to 0.33 and
NPVs were 0.99 to 1.00.
Cancer Detection and Recall Rates With
Supplemental Screening
In general, supplemental screening after negative
results on screening mammography consistently de-
tected additional cases of breast cancer, most of which
were invasive. Eighteen studies reported rates of addi-
tional cancer detected, and most also reported recall
and biopsy rates associated with supplemental screen-
ing (Table 4 and Appendix Figure 5, available at www
.annals.org). With the possible exception of DBT, sup-
plemental testing led to many additional recalls and
biopsies.
HHUS and ABUS
Seven studies reported HHUS cancer detection
rates (27, 28, 31–33), and 3 studies reported on ABUS
(35–37). The two good-quality studies of HHUS consis-
tently estimated an all-cancer detection rate after neg-
ative mammography findings of 4.4 per 1000 examina-
tions (CI, 2.5 to 7.2) (25, 26), with invasive cancer
making up 93% (25) and 88% (26) of detected cancers.
In the same women, mammography cancer detection
rates were 4.7 per 1000 examinations in the U.S. study
(25) and 2.8 per 1000 examinations in the Italian study
(26). Only the U.S. study reported the recall rate for
supplemental HHUS: 14% (CI, 12.7% to 15.1%) (25).
Three fair-quality studies reported cancer detec-
tion rates for ABUS. Cancer detection rates after nega-
tive results on mammography ranged from 1.9 to 15.2
per 1000 examinations (36, 37). In comparison, the can-
cer detection rate from mammography alone in 1 of
these studies was 4.3 per 1000 examinations (37). Re-
call rates varied between the studies from 2% (CI, 1.1%
to 2.0%) to 14% (CI, 12.9% to 14.0%) (35, 36).
MRI
In 3 good-quality studies of MRI after negative
mammography results, breast cancer detection rates
varied from 3.5 (CI, 1.3 to 7.6) to 28.6 (CI, 5.9 to 81.2)
per 1000 examinations (25, 38, 39), with small numbers
of cancer cases detected (range, 2 to 7). In comparison,
rates of mammography cancer detection in 2 of these
studies for women with dense breasts were 4.1 and 7.0
per 1000 examinations (25, 38). Invasive breast cancer
made up 67% and 86% of detected cancer, as reported
by 2 studies (25, 39). Notably, women in these studies
probably had higher breast cancer risk than the gen-
eral population of women with dense breasts. A good-
quality U.S. study evaluated supplemental HHUS and
MRI among 334 women without BRCA mutations or
previous breast cancer; after 3 screening rounds with
negative mammography and HHUS results over 24
months, screening breast MRI identified 6 additional
cases of invasive cancer (25).
Recall rates ranged from 9% (CI, 4.0% to 15.7%) to
23% (CI, 18.9% to 28.3%); the rate was highest in the
study with 3 rounds of screening (25, 39). Biopsy rates
were not reported separately for subgroups of women
without increased risk. Because 2 of the studies re-
ported on only 1 round of screening, the cumulative
effect of recall for additional imaging and biopsy would
likely increase with additional screening rounds.
DBT
Four fair-quality studies of DBT (3 in the United
States [41–43] and 1 in Italy [40]) reported on screening
populations of women with dense breasts. All U.S. stud-
ies were single-site, retrospective studies, and gener-
ally focused on outcomes before and after DBT intro-
duction. In 1 study, breast cancer risk among women
was described as above average (41); other studies did
not report on risk factors (40, 42, 43). Three studies

 reported cancer detection rates with digital mammog-
raphy alone ranging from 4.0 to 5.2 per 1000 examina-
tions (40, 42, 43). With DBT, combined detection
ranged from 5.4 (CI, 3.5 to 7.9) to 6.9 (CI, 4.8 to 9.6) per
1000 examinations (42, 43). A single study reported
that 67% of cancer cases detected with combined DBT
and mammography were invasive, the same proportion
as with mammography alone (42). Recall rates with DBT
in 3 retrospective U.S. studies ranged from 7% (CI,
6.2% to 7.7%) to 11% (CI, 10.0% to 11.7%), compared
with 9% (CI, 8.4% to 11.0%) to 17% (CI, 15.0% to 18.2%)
with digital mammography alone (41–43).
Harms of Breast Density Notification
Only 1 study, a good-quality Canadian random-
ized, controlled trial, examined the effects of notifying
women with normal screening results that their mam-
mograms showed dense breasts (44). Women ran-
domly assigned to the intervention group (n = 285) re-
ceived a report of their breast density with letters
summarizing their mammography results and a pam-
phlet on breast cancer risk factors, including density.
No
supplemental
screening
was
recommended.
Women randomly assigned to the control group (n =
333) were notified of mammography results without in-
formation on breast density. At 4 weeks, more women
in the intervention group had statistically significantly
increased knowledge of breast density (25% in the in-
tervention group vs. 8% in the control group) and were
more likely to perceive themselves as having elevated
breast cancer risk. These differences did not persist at 6
months. Psychological distress, breast cancer worry,
and preoccupation with breast cancer did not differ be-
tween groups.
Other Harms of Supplemental Screening
In studies of supplemental screening with HHUS
and ABUS, more than 90% of positive test results were
false-positive, and in MRI studies 66% to 97% of all pos-
itive test results were false-positives. Although no stud-
ies
specifically
addressed
harms
of
supplemental
screening in women with dense breasts, harms stem-
ming from false-positive results are likely to be at least
equivalent to those from mammography (45). We
found no studies of whether focus on breast density
distracts from assessment of other risk factors for breast
cancer. Use of gadolinium contrast required for breast
MRI has been associated with nephrogenic systemic fi-
brosis in patients with acute kidney injury or chronic
kidney disease, but we found no reports of this adverse
effect specifically related to breast MRI. The ACR rec-
ommends screening with serum creatinine before ad-
ministration of gadolinium for those aged 60 years and
older with hypertension, diabetes, or history of renal
disease (46). Harms from DBT could come from addi-
tional breast radiation exposure (40–43, 47).
DISCUSSION
We examined the consistency of categorical BI-
RADS breast density determinations in U.S. community
practices because this is the system recommended by
the ACR and written into most of the legislative man-
dates. According to large, community practice–based
studies, BI-RADS density assessments at a population
level were generally consistent across sequential exam-
inations by the same or different readers, but there was
important variability among readings for individual
women. Approximately 80% of examinations received a
b or c BI-RADS density assessment; these categories

 were also most likely to be reassessed differently,
whether on a separate reading of the same examina-
tion or on a subsequent examination, and whether read
by the same or a different reader. As a result, across
studies a sizeable 13% to 19% of women (13–19) were
reclassified from “nondense” to “dense” or vice versa.
In these instances, mandated communications about
elevated breast cancer risk or the need for additional
clinical screenings could provide inconsistent informa-
tion for the same woman in the span of 2 to 3 years.
Breast density findings can change because of mul-
tiple factors related to the woman being examined, the
qualitative nature of the technique, and radiologist vari-
ability in interpretation of the examinations. The studies
we examined tried to control for within-woman biolog-
ical factors, suggesting that most of the variation in
breast density assessment reflects within- and between-
radiologist variability in density interpretation and the
limitations of the current BI-RADS approach. Concerns
about BI-RADS breast density determinations are a ma-

 jor impetus for research examining other methods for
assigning breast density, including automated volumet-
ric estimates, ultrasonographic assessments, and other
computer-assisted methods. Although variability is re-
duced by use of double readings, which is widely prac-
ticed in Europe (40), this approach is impractical in the
United States because of workforce requirements. The
introduction of standards and quality measures related
to breast density categorization could help to minimize
potential harms associated with variable breast density
categorizations.
When combined with mandated direct-to-consumer
communications, variability in breast density assign-
ments may lead to unintended consequences. Reclas-
sification from one overall category to another (for ex-
ample, “dense” to “not-dense” or vice versa) may
undermine a woman'
s confidence in the screening pro-
cess and leave her uncertain about her risk for breast
cancer, whereas the opposite reclassification may alarm
women unnecessarily or prompt supplemental screen-
ing tests of uncertain value. The ACR has publicly
expressed similar cautions about benefits, possible
harms, and unintended consequences for the commu-
nication of breast density assessments to women (48).
Few studies evaluated test performance of supple-
mental screening tests for women with dense breasts.
In the studies identified, the sensitivity of supplemental
MRI screening after negative screening mammography
results appeared generally higher than that seen with
HHUS screening. However, although we examined sub-
sets of women without specific risk factors, we suspect
that, in general, these women were at higher risk. Stud-
ies of MRI were small and variable in their sensitivity
estimates. No study directly compared sensitivity of
supplemental screening modalities among women with
dense breasts. Specificity of supplemental screening
modalities was similar, and PPV was low. We identified
only one study of ABUS and no studies of DBT test
performance in women with dense breasts. No studies
examined the effects of age or other breast cancer risk
factors on supplemental test performance characteris-
tics in women with dense breasts. No studies reported
on breast cancer morbidity and mortality outcomes.
Evidence on harms of supplemental screening was
also sparse. Added to digital mammography, DBT
more than doubles the radiation exposure from each
screening examination (49–51). New estimates of can-
cer induced by radiation from breast imaging have re-
cently been reported (47). Technology that allows re-
construction of the 2-dimensional breast images can
reduce radiation exposure but is not widely dissemi-
nated (49). We found no reports of adverse effects from
use of gadolinium contrast for breast MRI, but a track-
ing mechanism for this potentially severe, albeit rare,
adverse effect should be considered. Potential harms
resulting from overdiagnosis of breast cancer through
supplemental screening can be identified only through
rigorous prospective studies with long-term follow-up.
Our review was limited to studies published in Eng-
lish; studies published in other languages may have
met inclusion criteria, although applicability to U.S.
practice could be limited. For applicability and feasibil-
ity concerns, we focused only on BI-RADS breast den-
sity assessment. Studies did not examine the underly-
ing reasons for variability in BI-RADS assessment within
or between radiologists, nor did they evaluate any in-
terventions to reduce the variability. The number, qual-
ity, and rigor of studies of diagnostic test characteristics
and clinical outcomes were limited. Most studies lacked
a complete reference standard, sufficient follow-up, or
a clear description of follow-up, so diagnostic test per-
formance characteristics could not be evaluated. Recall
was often not clearly defined. No studies compared in-
terval breast cancer rates, stage at diagnosis, or breast
cancer mortality among two groups of women with
dense breasts undergoing screening mammography
with or without supplemental testing. No studies ad-
dressed the important potential risks of overdiagnosis
and the associated harms of unnecessary treatment.
Many studies included mixtures of women at increased
breast cancer risk due to risk factors other than breast
density, limiting the generalizability to the general
screening population of women with dense breasts. Lit-
erature on ABUS and DBT for women with dense
breasts was limited, as was literature on the harms of
breast density notification. Only 1 comparative study of
cohorts with and without supplemental screening ad-
justed for differences between cohorts (42).
In conclusion, good-quality studies with U.S. radiol-
ogists show important reclassification between dense
and nondense breasts in women undergoing sequen-
tial screening examinations. Reclassification of breast
density may introduce confusion or reduce confidence
among women. Moving from a “dense” to a “non-
dense” breast categorization may result in different
mandated communications in states with breast density
notification, as well as fluctuation in clinical recommen-
dations for supplemental screening.
Limited evidence suggests that more breast cancer
cases will be detected by supplemental HHUS and MRI
screening of women with dense breasts, and most de-
tected breast cancer cases will be invasive. Studies
have not evaluated whether diagnosis of additional
breast cancer by supplemental screening leads to im-
proved clinical outcomes or what proportion of the
cancer diagnosed represents overdiagnosis. Supple-
mental testing of women with dense breasts with HHUS
or MRI is associated with increased recall rates for di-
agnostic investigation among women without breast
cancer. Use of DBT may be associated with lower recall
rates, but studies are few and retrospective. To define
meaningful clinical outcomes of supplemental screen-
ing of women with dense breasts, well-designed, long-
term, prospective, comparative studies of supplemen-
tal screening are needed.

KQ 1: What are the accuracy and reproducibility of BI-RADS determination of breast density?
KQ 2: What are the test performance characteristics of newer technologies for breast cancer screening when used as supplemental tests after a negative
          screening mammogram in women found to have dense breasts, and how do these performance characteristics differ by age and risk factors?
KQ 3: When performed after a negative screening mammogram in women found to have dense breasts, what is the effectiveness of supplemental screening
          with breast ultrasonography, MRI, or breast tomosynthesis on proximate clinical outcomes, including cancer detection rates, DCIS detection rates, stage at
          diagnosis, recall rates, biopsy rates, and interval cancer rates?
KQ 4: What are the harms associated with being identified as having dense breasts, including psychological and quality-of-life impacts and harms associated
          with supplemental screening evaluation, including evaluation of false-positive results?

system between 1996 and 1998 and were enrolled in
the system for at least 2 years following screening; the
test set was designed to include about twice as many
examinations of women with cancer as without, and
roughly equal numbers of non-dense and dense
examinations based on clinical interpretation
