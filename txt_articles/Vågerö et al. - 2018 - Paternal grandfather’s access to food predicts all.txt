Studies of animals and plants suggest that nutritional conditions in one generation may affect
phenotypic characteristics in subsequent generations. A small number of human studies
claim to show that pre-pubertal nutritional experience trigger a sex-specific transgenerational
response along the male line. A single historical dataset, the Överkalix cohorts in northern
Sweden, is often quoted as evidence. To test this hypothesis on an almost 40 times larger
dataset we collect harvest data during the pre-pubertal period of grandparents (G0, n =
9,039) to examine its potential association with mortality in children (G1, n = 7,280) and
grandchildren (G2, n = 11,561) in the Uppsala Multigeneration Study. We find support for the
main Överkalix finding: paternal grandfather’s food access in pre-puberty predicts his male,
but not female, grandchildren’s all-cause mortality. In our study, cancer mortality contributes
strongly to this pattern. We are unable to reproduce previous results for diabetes and car-
diovascular mortality.

egulation of gene expression in response to environmental
cues establishes a link between nature and nurture. Such a
response may be carried over to the next generation as a so-
called transgenerational response (TGR), and affect offspring
phenotype. Epigenetically based TGR in mammals and plants has
been shown1-4. Epigenetic changes transmitted through the
germline in the Agouti mouse impacted five successive genera-
tions5. Evidence of TGR in humans is much more limited6–8. One
of the problems in human studies is to separate genetic, epige-
netic and cultural influences in transgenerational processes. This
is particularly the case if they operate simultaneously and interact,
which is very possible.
Recently, a series of much-cited papers based on the Överkalix
cohorts in northern Sweden9–12 has provided indirect evidence
for a TGR. The authors reported that food shortage induced by
harvest failures, or food abundance after a rich harvest, affected
mortality outcomes in two subsequent generations. An intriguing
aspect of these studies is the conjecture that an epigenetic path-
way, carrying information across generations, may open up just
before puberty, during the so-called slow growth period (SGP)
10,12. Pre-puberty may be one of several “windows” for germline
reprogramming13,14 in response to nutritional signals. A number
of mechanisms for transmission across generations have been
suggested, usually involving DNA methylation, chromatin for-
mation or small noncoding RNAs. After fertilization, in the
preimplantation embryo, epigenetic modifications acquired early
in life are then usually erased, but not fully15. Imprinting on
specific loci may resist the post fertilization wave of reprogram-
ming, eventually causing changes in offspring phenotype that are
not driven by changes of the DNA sequence. Yehuda et al.16
found that offspring of Holocaust survivors showed specific DNA
methylation changes. Gapp et al.17. demonstrated that traumatic
stress in the early life of mice altered sperm microRNA expres-
sion, with behavioral and metabolic consequences in offspring.
Rodgers et al.18. found that paternal stress in mice altered sperm
microRNA content, although this was not restricted to peri-
pubertal stress. A transgenerational response, triggered during
childhood, may also relate to an individual’s genetic background,
to changes in DNA sequence induced by environmental factors or
due to chance events, such as de novo mutations in the germ line
with the potential to change phenotypical characteristics in sub-
sequent generations.
The findings from the Överkalix cohorts imply that grand-
parental access to food during their slow growth period can
modify diabetes and all-cause mortality in grandchildren. Car-
diovascular mortality on the other hand was associated with
parental, but not grandparental, nutritional experience. The
authors interpret their results11 as “proof-of-principle that a sex-
specific male-line transgenerational effect exists in humans”,
which they consider likely to be epigenetic rather than genetic,
cultural or social. A summary of the Överkalix findings is avail-
able in19. Their findings have been discussed in renowned peer-
reviewed journals20–24 and are cited over 2,000 times (October
2018).
To establish evidence for a transgenerational response to early
human nutritional experience, carried via the germline rather
than based on direct in-utero exposure or maintained through
continuity in social circumstances, we need to observe at least
three generations and exogenous variation in the early nutritional
conditions of the first generation. In addition, we need inter-
generational social data. The Överkalix cohorts allow that kind of
analysis, but suffer from other potential problems. Firstly, food
access for six ancestors was examined in three small birth cohorts,
where family ties were interwoven and rather complex. This has
given rise to the concern that a multitude of comparisons have
produced random or biased findings25,26. Secondly, since crop
failures and very abundant harvests were rather infrequent,
exposure to a nutritional shock during pre-puberty implies that
individuals were born in particular years, leaving room for con-
founding due to birth cohort effects.
The current paper tests the hypothesis proposed in the Över-
kalix studies, that prepubertal nutritional conditions in one
generation affect health outcomes in subsequent generations in a
sex-specific manner. We, firstly, replicate all the Överkalix epi-
demiological analyses and, secondly, go beyond previously
reported outcomes by also including cancer mortality in the
grandchild generation. In this we are inspired by the work of
Frankel et al.27 who had demonstrated that abundant food in
childhood was linked to elevated cancer mortality later in life. We
use three linked generations (G0, G1, G2) of the Uppsala Birth
Cohort Multigeneration Study. We follow the Överkalix approach
in using the exogenous variation in harvests, based on crop sta-
tistics by region every year from 1874–1910 (details below). Easy
or difficult access to food in a certain year and region is measured
from this statistic. The validity of this method is discussed in the
Methods section.
Our results support the hypothesis that a transgenerational
response to abundant food in pre-puberty exists, along the male
but not along the female line.
Results
Statistical power. The most important results are given as
Tables 1–3. Detailed results are given as Supplementary Tables 1
to 6. We estimated the effects of food access in generation 0 (G0)
on mortality in their grandchildren (G2) and in their children
(G1). All results refer to G0 food access during the slow growth
period, defined as ages 9–12 for boys and 8–10 for girls9.
The statistical power to find an association of at least the same
strength as that reported from the Överkalix studies for each of
their ten significant (p < 0.05) or near-significant (p <0.10) results
is shown in Supplementary Table 7. In analyses of G2 mortality
this power varied from 72 to 99%. In analyzing G1 mortality, it
was over 99%.

 All-cause mortality. If a paternal grandfather (G0) had unusually
good access to food his grandsons (G2) appeared to have an
elevated all-cause mortality (Table 1, model 1: HR = 1.50; 95% CI
0.99-2.26). This became clear when we adjusted for G0 birth year
(model 2: HR = 1.55; CI: 1.02–2.35). In contrast, there was no
excess mortality among his granddaughters (model 2: HR = 0.74;
CI: 0.38–1.46; interaction by gender p = 0.053). We found
(Supplementary Table 1) no link between either maternal
grandparents’ or paternal grandmothers’ food access during their
SGP and their grandchildren’s all cause-mortality.
We tested sensitivity to the urban/rural factor by excluding all
G0 who during their SGP were living in one of the then ten
biggest cities in Sweden (seven of them are seaports). City
inhabitants so defined constituted 17% of G0. Excluding them
gave a somewhat higher estimate for grandsons with a paternal
grandfather who experienced good harvest (model 2: HR = 1.68;
CI: 1.02–2.78; interaction by gender p = 0.056).
Thus, our results suggest an elevated mortality among grand-
sons of paternal grandfathers with good access to food.
Cardiovascular and diabetes mortality. Food access in G0 was
not significantly associated with cardiovascular disease mortality
in grandchildren (Supplementary Table 2). We performed addi-
tional analyses combining hospitalizations and deaths with a
CVD diagnosis as main or contributory cause, with the same
result (Supplementary Table 5).
Table 2 suggests that a maternal grandmother who enjoyed
good access to food during her SGP confers an increased risk of
diabetes on her grandchildren. This result was only visible in
model 2 (HR = 3.38; CI: 1.18–9.65). A further analysis, using an
event of either hospitalization or death from diabetes (underlying
or contributory diagnosis) as outcome, failed to confirm this
result (Supplementary Table 6). This association should therefore
be interpreted with caution.
Supplementary Table 4 suggests that there is no link between
parents’ access to food and their children’s all-cause or cardiovas-
cular mortality. We did observe, however, an elevated diabetes
mortality risk among sons in both models (model 2: HR = 1.84;
CI: 1.21–2.79), but not among daughters (interaction by gender
p = 0.08) whose fathers enjoyed good access to food.
Cancer mortality. Finally, we examined cancer, a group of
causes-of-death not explored in the Överkalix studies, but highly
relevant given that it is a leading cause of death in Sweden.
Table 3 suggests that if a paternal grandfather had good access to
food his male, but not female, grandchildren had a higher risk of
dying from cancer (model 2: HR = 3.44; CI: 1.87–6.34). This
excess mortality was found both in tobacco-related cancers and
cancers not related to tobacco. A highly significant interaction
with G2 gender (p = 0.005) was observed. (Supplementary
Table 3).
In additional analyses, we found no association between
paternal grandfather’s good access to food and all other (non-
cancer) causes-of-death grouped together. Thus, cancer deaths
appear to drive the all-cause mortality result for paternal
grandfathers in our study.
Discussion
We did reproduce one of the main Överkalix results concerning
all-cause mortality. For paternal grandfathers with good access to
food during their SGP, we find an elevated mortality in grandsons
but not in granddaughters. This excess risk among male grand-
children is also highlighted in Pembrey et al.11.
However, we were unable to reproduce any of their findings for
cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. We note, however, that both
our replication and the original Överkalix study10 failed to find an
association between grandparental access to food and a grand-
child’s mortality from CVD.

 We could not reproduce their often-quoted finding that
paternal grandfathers’ exposure to an abundant harvest predicts
elevated diabetes mortality in their grandchildren. However,
based on 289 deaths, we did find that male offspring of fathers
with good access to food were more prone to diabetes. This male-
line (father → son) pathway was not observed in the much smaller
Överkalix study. Our finding that maternal grandmothers’
exposure to food abundance was linked to grandchild diabetes
mortality found no support in the Överkalix data.
A key finding of our study concerns cancer, a common cause-
of-death in the grandchild generation. We found a clear asso-
ciation between paternal grandfathers with good access to food
and their grandsons’ mortality from cancer (as a main or con-
tributory cause-of-death). Further, based on 236 cancer deaths,
we found a strong interaction between paternal grandfathers’
exposure and G2 gender, with men being affected but not women
(test for interaction p = 0.005).
Following Frankel et al.27 we separated cancers into tobacco-
related and other cancers. Both categories showed an elevated
mortality among grandsons of paternal grandfathers with good
access to food; among granddaughters cancer mortality was not
elevated at all. This gender interaction was driven by cancers not
related to tobacco. The use of an alternative classification of
cancers28 gave the same results and served as a sensitivity test.
Some differences between the two studies should be con-
sidered. In the Överkalix studies, the mortality effect from par-
ental or grandparental exposure to food shortage or food
abundance was always calculated whilst controlling for the
exposure of other ancestors. Mostly, only the results after full
control of all ancestors were reported. We were only able to take
three ancestors into account (all in the paternal or maternal line).
A test (see “Method” section) suggests that this difference does
not introduce confounding.
Controlling for family social circumstances was done in both
studies as a way to rule out the possibility that the observed
associations were driven by social or cultural factors. In model 1
(in all tables), we have reproduced the Överkalix studies as closely
as possible and followed them in controlling for a number of
social circumstances which affected G2 from early in life (see
Method section). However, our model 2 differs from the Över-
kalix method in also controlling for G0 birth year, which is linked
both to the likelihood of experiencing a good harvest (later G0
births were more likely to experience good harvests) and to
secular trends which influence long-term mortality, such as
smoking.
It is also important to take secular trends in the use of ferti-
lizers and pesticides into consideration. During the 1870-1910
period, such practices were still on a low level29. When one looks
at all significant estimates, they are without exception stronger in
models 2 (controlling for G0 birth year) than in models 1. This
suggests that our results are not due to confounding from secular
trends in smoking or farming practices.
Our G2 study population is 38 times larger than the combined
Överkalix cohorts (number of persons at risk) and it is younger,
born later. The number of deaths in our G2 is twice as large as in
the Överkalix cohorts; the statistical uncertainty in studying
grandparental effects (G0 → G2) is therefore smaller. Our G1
population is also considerably larger than that of the Överkalix
studies. Our estimates of effects from parent to child (G0 → G1)
are based on more than 20 times as many deaths; random errors
should therefore be considerably smaller.
The above analysis comprises multiple comparisons. That this
may introduce random results is a legitimate concern. We cal-
culated the probability of reproducing, by chance, at least one of
the Överkalix results for grandchild mortality, assuming that
there are no real associations in either study. There are four
grandparents, each exposed to two events (poor or good harvest),
with one outcome (all-cause mortality) in the two genders in G2
plus two outcomes (diabetes and CVD mortality) in the two
genders combined. In other words, we replicate 32 analyses in G2.
The likelihood that both the Överkalix study and our replication
of their analyses will produce a significant result in a particular
analysis is 0.05 × 0.05 = 0.0025. The chance that both will then
point in the same direction (significantly high or significantly
low) is 0.5. Thus the likelihood of reproducing a particular result
in any one of the 32 G2 analyses should be 32 × 0.0025 × 0.5 =
0.04. In the 24 G1 analyses it is 0.03.
Since the one result that we did reproduce, involving paternal
grandfathers, is the one with the strongest a priori backing11,19,
our parallel findings are unlikely to be due to chance. The dis-
crepancies between our two studies concern diabetes and CVD
and could be due to randomness or to differences in real-life
contexts of the two studies, such as the recording of cause-of-
death. Since our population of grandchildren was born in a more
recent era, some historical effects may simply not be revealed
today. Early death due to infections became more unusual
throughout the 20th century; cardiovascular disease in Sweden
has been declining since around 1980, while cancer is slowly
becoming a more common cause-of-death.
The conclusion in Pembrey et al.11 and Kaati et al.12 that a
male-line transgenerational effect exists was chiefly based on
associations between the paternal grandfather’s exposure in SGP
and all-cause mortality in his grandsons, and the paternal
grandmother’s exposure in SGP and all-cause mortality in her
granddaughters. In contrast, we found no impact of paternal
grandmother’s food access on her female offspring’s all-cause
mortality. The influence of paternal grandfather on all-cause
mortality of grandsons, but not granddaughters, was the one key
result of the Överkalix studies that we could reproduce.
CVD played no role in this excess mortality among G2 men in
either study. Neither did diabetes in our study. We suggest that
the excess mortality among male grandchildren whose paternal
grandfathers enjoyed good access to food, found in both studies,
is at least partly based on cancer mortality. Alternatively, the
mortality excess among grandsons could also be of a more general
kind,
reflecting
general
susceptibility
transmitted
across
generations.
The finding of a transgenerational response to abundant
childhood nutrition in both studies does not prove that the
pathway is epigenetic. We refer broadly to epigenetics as heritable
changes of gene function not induced by changes in the DNA
sequence. Such changes can nevertheless be influenced by DNA
sequence. Epigenetic events (such as methylation of DNA) could
be genotype-dependent, as shown by several authors, for
instance30,31. When this is the case we will only be able to observe
an average effect, across genotypes.
De novo mutations in the grandparental generation could
happen as a response to specific exposures, such as fertilizers,
pesticides and mold. Regional differences in harvests could in
principle be influenced by differences in the use of fertilizers and
pesticides. However, this practice hardly seems common enough
at this time29 to cause new mutations on a large scale. It might
have been more difficult to store food during rich harvests when
all available storing capacity was exploited. Aflatoxin, a mold
thriving in poorly stored food, is a potent carcinogen/mutagen,
known to cause mutations in the tumor suppressing TP53 gene32.
There is a lack of data concerning these potential exposures in the
1873-1910 period and we can only speculate about their role.
Previous studies of intergenerational effects on offspring health
or survival have often focused on starvation or severe food
shortage33,34. This focus may have been methodologically
rewarding but theoretically narrow. Nutritional signals may be

 based on subtle differences in amount and kind of nutrition. In
our study, as in the Överkalix studies, it appears that food
abundance during the slow growth period is important. Abun-
dant harvests should mean good access to grains and many
vegetables, rich in folates and working as methyl donors.
Waterland and Jirtle35 discuss the importance of dietary
methyl donors for DNA methylation. They suggest that “early
methyl donor malnutrition (i.e. over- or undernutrition) could
effectively lead to premature epigenetic aging, thereby contribute
to an enhanced susceptibility to chronic disease in later life”
(p.63). The reference to epigenetic aging suggests a vulnerability
to disease in general. Two elements in the genome may be
especially sensitive to nutritional dysregulation: transposons and
imprinted genes30. Imprinted genes are usually marked for
parent-of-origin in sperm or ova, in sperm thus marked by
father’s experience.
Epigenetics play a central role in neoplasia36–38. Numerous
small ncRNAs are exclusively or preferentially expressed in testis
or germ cells in humans and mice39. Reddy40 concluded that
aberrant miRNA expression is a rule rather than an exception in
carcinogenesis. Hypermethylation of CpG islands upstream from
tumor suppressor genes would influence cancer risk41. The
silencing of tumor suppressor miRNAs contributes to the devel-
opment of human cancer and metastasis42. A transgenerational
response to abundant childhood food could thus be based either
on epigenetic mechanisms linked to nutrition, or de novo
mutations linked to new farming practices, or both together since
these mechanisms are not mutually exclusive.
The so-called Carnegie survey of family diet and health in
prewar Britain collected very detailed information about chil-
dren’s food intake in 1937-39. Frankel et al.27. followed the
children up to 1996 with regard to mortality. Controlling for
social factors they observed that boys and girls consuming rich
food (highest fifth of energy content) were more than twice as
likely to die of cancer later in life compared to the lowest fifth.
This effect was particularly strong for cancer not related to
tobacco. In their view, it was the high energy content of the food
that gave rise to this effect rather than any mutagenic or carci-
nogenic substances in food. Still, assuming that the number of
cells in (organs of) the body respond to abundant nutrition early
in life, the risk of de novo mutations due to chance would
increase in proportion to cell numbers. Consistent with this
hypothesis, obesity43, body height44 and number of (stem) cells in
specific organs45,46 have all been linked to cancer mortality.
Abundance of food, when the body is just about to leap into
puberty, i.e., an energy demanding development, may also
influence genome-wide DNA methylation patterns in boys and
girls, including in germ-line DNA, and impact on small non-
coding RNAs in sperm cells.
Soubry et al.13 suggested four periods of susceptibility, when a
change of epigenetic patterns in male germ cells would be pos-
sible. One of them is the period just before puberty, equivalent to
the slow growth period, which is the period we have examined in
this replication study.
Could nutritional experience in one generation thus trigger a
transgenerational response in subsequent generations? Our
results lend support for the existence of a male-line transge-
nerational pathway, triggered by events during the paternal
grandfather’s slow growth period. We would like to be cautious
about the specific mechanism. However, the hypothesis that a
molecular signal of abundant nutrition received in this period
could be captured by male gametes, cannot be rejected and should
thus be further explored8. The implications for our understanding
of ourselves are substantial47.
Methods
Study population. The Uppsala Birth Cohort Multigeneration Study (UBCoS
Multigen) started with manually tracing, in archives, all births at Akademiska
Hospital in Uppsala 1915–1929 (n = 14,612). Its multigenerational extension
includes the 12,168 individuals in the first generation (G1) who have later been
identified by their personal ID number. We traced their (now deceased) parents
(G0) manually and their children (G2) through linking to the Swedish Multi-
generational Registry. The other parent of a G2 child was not included in the
original UBCoS Generation 1. This means that we usually have information about
paternal or maternal grandparents, but not about all four. Figure 1 illustrates the
three linked generations, and the number of members in each generation in this
particular study. The multigenerational data base is suitable for our purpose48,49.
The statistical power to detect effects of the same size as those reported from the
Överkalix cohorts is reported in Supplementary Table 7.
Information about G0 was obtained from the original birth records of G1 and
from information collected from parish and hospital registers. Their places of birth
were collected from the sixth edition of the Swedish Death Index, published by
Statistics Sweden and the Swedish Genealogical Society. G0 consists of 15,706
individuals, born 1851–1914, the overwhelming majority born outside the city of
Uppsala. In this study, we include those born from 1865 to 1900 (n = 9039) for
whom we have collected harvest data. Our main study focus is the grandchildren
(G2) of these 9039 individuals. G2 includes all of G1’s children born 1932 or later
who had not died by the start of 1961. Adopted children (n = 381), individuals
whose personal identity number has been reused and those whose death date was
obviously wrong (n = 48) were excluded. Since we restricted the analyses to G2
individuals for whom we had harvest information for both maternal or both
paternal grandparents, we were able to analyze outcomes in 11,561 grandchildren.
In additional analyses, we studied G1 mortality in 3820 men and 3460 women
by their G0 mothers’ and fathers’ food access.
Linking of individuals to patient and mortality data was made by Statistics
Sweden and all analyses were made on data anonymized to researchers. This
follows standard practice in large registry-based observational studies in Sweden.
The Regional Ethical Review Board of Stockholm approved of all aspects of the
study (dnr 2015/904-3115; dnr 2016/933-32).

 Exposure data: contextual variation approach. Harvest variations between years
and regions across Sweden were substantial. Exposure in G0 (access to food) was
defined from this variation. This is referred to as an “intention to treat instrumental
variable approach” in the econometrics literature50.
There were 24 regions in all, based on the administrative unit (län). In the year
1890, the population of Sweden was 4.8 million, so an average region covered
around 200,000 inhabitants. Most grandparental sample members (around 55%)
are from the region around Uppsala (Uppsala Län), which counts among the
smaller regions and contained about 120,000 inhabitants. There would be a certain
variation in harvests within all regions. Trade within regions would have reduced
the importance of these differences, as administrative divisions often followed trade
and commercial patterns. This would certainly have reduced the within-region
differences in food access.
The regional average in a certain year would in all likelihood be an
underestimation of actual food consumption in rich families and an overestimation
in poor families. We controlled for social factors as far as possible in all analyses,
which would have reduced any social bias.
Finally, excluding city dwellers gave stronger estimates of effect, suggesting that
actual food consumption was better captured among rural inhabitants.
Our measure of access to food was based on an annually published regional
harvest statistic for 1874–191051 ranging from 0 (total crop failure) to 10
(abundant harvest). Each G0 individual was assigned an access to food value, year
by year during his/her slow growth period (SGP, defined as ages 9–12 for boys and
8–10 for girls), based on that statistic for his/her region of residence.
A weighting procedure was applied, based on the assumption that harvests took
place on September 1st. G0 entering their SGP in September were considered to
rely fully on the current year’s harvest. Those with birthdays later in the year relied
partly on the subsequent year’s harvest (current year’s harvest × 11/12 + next year’s
harvest × 1/12 for those born in October). For those with birthdays earlier in the
year a corresponding dependence on the previous year’s harvest was assumed. A
weighted score of less than 5 (‘a fourth below typical harvest’) was considered a
poor harvest and a weighted score of 8.5 (‘more than good, unusually good’) or
more was considered a good harvest. Moderate harvests were thus defined as 5–8.4;
poor as 0–4.9 and good as 8.5–10.
G0 were then classified into one of three mutually exclusive exposure groups,
who (1) experienced at least one good harvest and no poor harvest during SGP
(n = 478) (2) experienced only moderate harvests during SGP (reference category,
n = 8,142), or (3) experienced at least one poor harvest and no good harvest during
SGP (n = 419). No G2 individual in the study population had a grandparent who
experienced both good and poor harvests in SGP.
To control for parental (G1) food access in analyses of the effects of
grandparental (G0) food access on G2 mortality we had to rely on annually
published national harvest statistics, thereby losing precision. A more recent period
(1923–1941) also meant less dramatic variation in exposure. This statistic ranged
from 1 (poor) to 5 (good), with 3 being average harvest. We applied the same
weighting procedure as for G0, and generated a binary variable for experiencing
good harvest in SGP (a weighted score of more than 3.3 any year, n = 2,631) or not
(a weighted score of 3.3 or less for all years, n = 2,713).
Region of residence at G0 birth was known for all included G0, and used as a
proxy for residence during SGP. A proportion of G0 moved between birth and age
ten. In a random sample of G0 (N = 211) we tested and confirmed that our results
concerning grandparental food abundance are not due to selective out-migration.
Outcome data: mortality and hospitalization. G2 mortality data for 1961–2015
was obtained from the Swedish Cause-of-Death Register. In total, 1255 (10%) of G2
died during follow-up. CVD, diabetes or cancer as underlying or contributing cause
of death were used when analyzing cause-specific mortality. CVD corresponds to
ICD-9 diagnoses 390–459; diabetes to code 250 and cancer to codes 140–209. In
additional analyses of G2 outcomes, we also used data from the Swedish In-patient
Register (1961–2015). An event was defined as a first case of hospitalization, or a
death. Since several disease entities may be entered on a death certificate or on a
hospital discharge note, individuals may contribute events to more than one cause-
specific analysis. Our analyses of all-cause mortality include two individuals with
known death date but unknown cause-of-death.
Control for confounding. In all regression analyses we controlled, as closely as
possible, for the same social and demographic factors as in the Överkalix studies.
Models 1 in Tables 1, 2, Supplementary Table 1, Supplementary Table 2 and
Supplementary Table 4 could therefore be regarded as a replication of these studies.
In model 2 we include further controls. Table 3, Supplementary Table 3, Supple-
mentary Table 5 and Supplementary Table 6 and models 2 everywhere represent
further explorations.
We considered food access of other ancestors. Our grandchild mortality analysis
could take into account the food access of three ancestors simultaneously—all three
on either the paternal or the maternal side. A small number of G1 members had
children together; for those G2 individuals (N = 605) we could compare estimates
adjusted for three and six ancestors. There were virtually no differences between
the two. Thus, estimates of the effect on G2 mortality from, say, paternal
grandfather’s or maternal grandmother’s food access, presented in tables, are
unlikely to be confounded by the effect of any other ancestor’s food access.
Social and demographic confounders were considered. G2 year of birth was
grouped into five-year age bands as a categorical variable in all tables, in model 1
and 2. Model 1 controlled for a number of social variables. These were mother’s
(maternal lineage) or father’s (paternal lineage) highest achieved education,
collected from the Swedish Census 1970, grouped into elementary or more than
elementary education; family income, obtained from the same source, grouped into
quintiles based on a couple’s total earned income; social class, from the Swedish
Census 1960 (non-manual workers, manual workers, farmers and entrepreneurs,
and unknown); mother’s parity, which defined sibling position of G2 as 1, 2, 3–4,
5–6 or 7 and higher; sibship size; and finally, whether a parent died before the child
was 18.
G0 birth year and common ancestors were also considered. Thus, models 2
controlled for G0 birth years (as linear trends) and cluster standard errors at family
level, to account for the fact that siblings and cousins share biological ancestors. In
analyses of G1 mortality we controlled for G1 birth year (5-year groups), G1 family
social class (six groups) and marital status at birth plus sibling position (defined as
in G2 analyses).
Models. In all G1 and G2 mortality analyses, we compared G0 individuals who
differed with respect to SGP ancestral food access, controlling for the above con-
founders in regression analyses. Hazard ratios (HR) were estimated by Cox pro-
portional hazard models with age as underlying time scale. For all HRs 95%
confidence limits are reported; analyses of interaction between food access and
gender were performed by introducing a product term and calculating a corre-
sponding p-value with Stata 14.2. All models accounted for censoring. Left cen-
soring arose, because our G2 data do not include individuals who died before 1
January 1961. For G1 mortality follow-up starts at 1 January 1952 (earliest data
with digitalized cause-of-death data). Right censoring arose if individuals emigrated
or survived beyond 31 December 2015. All analyses were performed using Stata
14.2.
