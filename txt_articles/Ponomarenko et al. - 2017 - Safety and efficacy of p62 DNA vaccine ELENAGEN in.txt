ABSTRACT
Elenagen is a plasmid encoding p62/SQSTM1, the first DNA vaccine possessing 
two mutually complementing mechanisms of action: it elicits immune response against 
p62 and mitigates systemic chronic inflammation. Previously, Elenagen demonstrated 
anti-tumor efficacy and safety in rodent tumor models and spontaneous tumors in 
dogs. This multicenter I/IIa trial evaluated safety and clinical activity of Elenagen in 
patients with advanced solid tumors. Fifteen patients were treated with escalating 
doses of Elenagen (1- 5 mg per doses, 5 times weekly) and additional 12 patients 
received 1 mg dose. Ten patients with breast and ovary cancers that progressed after 
Elenagen were then treated with conventional chemotherapy. Adverse events (AE) 
were of Grade 1; no severe AE were observed. Cumulatively twelve patients (44%) 
with breast, ovary, lung, renal cancer and melanoma achieved stable disease for at 
least 8 wks, with 4 of them (15%) had tumor control for more than 24 wks, with a

INTRODUCTION
Two mechanisms contributing to cancer have 
been extensively studied, inefficient anti-cancer immune 
response and chronic inflammation. Thus, two approaches 
to cancer therapy, stimulating anti-cancer immunity 
and eliminating chronic inflammation, are under active 
development. A novel biological agent, plasmid (DNA 
vaccine) encoding p62 (SQSTM1), acts through both of 
these mechanisms at the same time. Previously, it was 
demonstrated that anti-cancer agents may possess more 
than one activity, e.g. chemo-therapeutic agents inducing 
cancer cell death and modulating immune system at the 
same time. 
Comparing to traditional (protein/peptide) vaccines, 
DNA-based vaccines have several advantages: they can 
induce both humoral and cellular immunity, they are safe, 
inexpensive and stable, and can be easily modified to 
enhance immune response [1-5]. There is already approved 
anti-melanoma vaccine for dogs (Oncept), and a number 
of ongoing phase I-II trials of DNA vaccines for various 
solid tumors in humans [2, 6]. However, being efficient in 
small animals, DNA vaccines often are not strong enough 
to control tumors in humans. Besides immunosuppressive 
tumor microenvironment, another apparent reason for 
vaccine inefficiency is that they exert selective pressure 
on cancer cells, which leads to the loss of the vaccine-
encoded antigens (immune escape) and results in the 
tumor relapse [7, 8]. To avoid this problem, an effective 
antigen for a vaccine should be, besides evoking a robust 
immune response: 1) essential for cancer cells to avoid 
its loss through immunoediting; 2) dispensable for 
normal tissues to reduce the risk of toxicity, and 3) highly 
expressed in tumors as compared to the normal tissues [9]. 
We have chosen p62 (SQSTM1) protein as the 
antigen for a novel DNA vaccine (Elenagen). p62 is 
multifunctional protein which participates in selective 
autophagy and signal transduction, in particular, 
inflammatory response [10] [11]. p62 satisfies all the 
above requirements: 1) its levels are elevated in almost 
all human tumors tested so far; 2) tumors require p62 for 
growth and metastases, 3) p62 is dispensable for normal 
cells [3]. We have employed a plasmid DNA vaccine as a 
platform for p62 expression. 
In our preclinical studies of Elenagen we found 
that: 1) it’s intramuscular injection caused a strong anti-
tumor effect in various animal models of breast cancer, 
melanoma, sarcoma and lung carcinoma [12]; 2) along 
with inhibition of growth of primary tumors, it also 
suppressed metastases [12], which are responsible for 
90% of cancer-related deaths;3) importantly, beyond 
immune attack on tumors, Elenagen, unlike other 
vaccines, can also suppress chronic inflammation [13], a 
common feature of cancer that accelerates progression of 
the disease and worsens its outcome [14]; 4) apart from 
most of anti-cancer vaccines tested so far, it demonstrated 
efficiency not only in transplantable tumors in rodents, but 
also in spontaneous tumors of dogs that are very similar 
to humans [15].
Although DNA vaccines are generally considered 
safe enough [16], we performed broad-range preclinical 
safety studies of Elenagen in laboratory animals. The 
Elenagen administration was well-tolerated, without acute 
or chronic toxicity, allergic activity, and it did not cause 
embryonic toxicity and teratogenicity (Supplementary 
Table S1). There was no hematotoxic, hepatotoxic and 
nephrotoxic effects, as well as effects on carbohydrate and 
lipid metabolism. Furthermore, histological examination 
of brain, heart, lung, liver, kidney, spleen, thyroid and 
thymus did not find any anomalies. Overall, administration 
of Elenagen was not accompanied by any significant side 
effects (Supplementary Table S1). 
Based on these efficiency and safety data in animals, 
we started the first clinical trial of Elenagen in patient with 
solid tumors.
RESULTS
Patients
The study included 27 patients: 15 patients in 
dose-escalation cohorts, and 12 in extension cohort; 2 
patients have failed screening. Patient’s characteristics 
are presented in Table 1. All patients had progressive 
metastatic solid tumors of one of 6 localizations: breast, 
colon, kidney, lung, skin (melanoma), and ovary. The most 
common tumors studied were breast (33.3%) and ovary 
(22.2%) cancers, and melanoma (22.2%). Patients enrolled 
had several (up to 8) chemotherapy schemes but were 
at the tumor progression state at the time of enrollment 
(Table 1). 
Safety
All patients included in the study completed at 
least one course (5 injections) of Elenagen vaccinations, 
and no discontinuation of the treatment occurred. No 
serious AEs caused by vaccination in dose range of 1-5 
maximum of 32 wks. The patients with breast and ovary cancers achieved additional 
tumor stabilization for 12-28 wks when treated with chemotherapy following Elenagen 
treatment. Therefore, Elenagen demonstrated good safety profile and antitumor 
activity in advanced solid tumors. Especially encouraging is its ability to restore tumor 
sensitivity to chemotherapy.

mg were observed in any of 27 patient of the study. 
There was no any acute toxicity or manifestations 
of cardiotoxicity. Autoimmunity (dsDNA antibody) 
was also within a normal range (not shown). The most 
common treatment-related grade 1 AE were injection site 
erythema or swelling, nausea, fatigue and fever; these 
events were independent on dose, transient, and resolved 
without treatment (Table 2). Thus, based on these data we 
concluded that Elenagen is safe and without dose-limited 
toxicity in the range of 1-5 mg per injection per week.
Tumor response
Dose-escalation study
In the first part of the study, patients with different 
solid tumors were subjected to escalated doses of Elenagen 
and their tumor response was monitored by RESIST 
1.1 criteria every 8 wks until tumor progression. The 
best overall response observed was SD (stable disease): 
it happened in 3 of 5 patients in 1st cohort (1 mg), 1/5 
patients in 2nd cohort (2.5 mg), and 3/5 patients in 3rd 
cohort (5 mg) (Table 3). The maximal duration of SD 
observed in the 1st cohort was 32 wk, in the 2nd cohort - 24 
wks, and in 3rd cohort - 8 wks. Although small size of the 
cohorts does not allow to make reliable conclusion about 
dose-response effect, there is no apparent dependence at 
given Elenagen doses which is common for DNA vaccines 
[17, 18]. 
Patient’s tumor localization in the first 3 cohorts 
was selected randomly according to protocol inclusion/
exclusion criteria (Supplementary Table S2) and patient’s 
availability. SD was observed in different tumors: in 4 of 
8 patients with breast cancer (PFS from 8 to 32 wks), in 
2 of 2 patients with ovary cancer (PFS 8 and 24 wk), in 
1 patients of 2 with lung cancer (8 wk); and in none of 
3 with colon cancer (Table 3), demonstrating potentially 
broad anti-tumor activity of Elenagen. Furthermore, 
among major subtypes of breast cancer, SD was observed 
in 2 of 4 patients with triple-negative, in 1 of 2 with Her2 
positive, and in 1 of 2 ER+PR+Her2- tumors (Table 3), 
indicating that all major breast subtypes are sensitive to 
Elenagen.
Extended cohort study
Based on these pilot data on Elenagen efficiency, 
we extended our clinical study with 12 patients using

the lowest efficient dose (1 mg). The patients selected 
were with ovary cancer, melanoma and neuroendocrine 
renal cancer (Table 3). The efficiency of Elenagen in 
all 27 patients (combined 1st and 2nd parts of the study) 
is presented in Table 4. Besides breast cancer, SD was 
also observed in 4 from 6 patients with ovary cancer, 
in 2 from 6 patients with melanoma, and 1 patient with 
neuroendocrine renal cancer; in total, 12 patients from 27 
(44%) demonstrated SD for at least 8 wks. Remarkably, 
some patients with breast, ovary and renal cancer achieved 
tumor control for more prolonged period, from 24 to 32 
wks (4 of 27 patients) thus reaching clinical benefit rate 
of 15%. Based on these data, we concluded that Elenagen 
as a single agent can evoke tumor control in a range of 
solid tumors: breast, ovary, renal, lung and melanoma, but 
without apparent activity in colon cancer. 
Effect of chemotherapy on tumor response 
following Elenagen treatment
Seven breast cancer patients and three ovarian 
cancer patients who progressed after one or several rounds 
of Elenagen treatment were administered conventional 
chemotherapy on compassionate basis. The rational for 
this was that immunotherapy can synergize with chemo- 
and radiotherapy via several mechanisms (see refs [19-21] 
for review and Discussion below). We found that patients 
with breast and ovarian cancers who failed several rounds 
of previous chemotherapy and were considered treatment-

refractory, however, demonstrated rather prolonged 
tumor control (SD) (up to 28 wks) when treated with 
same chemotherapy regimen again (Table 5, 6). For 
example, 3 patients with triple-negative breast cancer (05-
001, 005, 012) responded to conventional DC regimen 
(doxorubicin-cyclophosphamide) after failing it as first-
line chemotherapy (Table 5). Accordingly, a patient with 
hormone-sensitive breast cancer (05-014) who stopped to 
respond to tamoxifen, restored sensitivity to it (Table 5). 
Ovarian cancer patients who failed platinum- and taxan-
based treatments restored sensitivity to carboplatin (05-
008, 016, Table 6). Some patients with breast and ovarian 
cancer also responded to new therapy regimens: eribulin 
in breast cancer and irinotecan for ovarian cancer (Table 
5, 6). Therefore, even if Elenagen did not stop tumor 
progression as a monotherapy or when tumors progressed 
after multiple rounds of Elenagen treatment, the disease 
still could be controlled by chemotherapy even if it 
stopped to work before. This may indicate that Elenagen 
could become the first agent restoring tumor sensitivity 
to chemotherapy. So far, this can be applied to breast 
and ovary cancers and several anti-neoplastic drugs such 
as cyclophosphamide, adriamycin, platinum and taxan 
derivatives, but it may be a wider phenomenon.
DISCUSSION
Among new methods to treat cancer, immunotherapy 
looks especially promising. Here we conducted a first-
in-human trial of Elenagen, a DNA vaccine targeting 
p62. Although p62 is not oncogene per se under normal 
conditions, its overexpression is a common feature of

various types of human tumors, and it correlates with 
tumor progression (see ref [3] for review). For example, in 
triple-negative breast and ovary cancers accumulation of 
p62 correlated with poor prognosis [22] [23]. It was also 
shown that upon oncogenic transformation p62 becomes 
necessary for tumor initiation and progression: Her2- 
-induced formation of breast cancer and RAS-induced 
formation of lung cancer are hampered in p62 knockout 
animals [24, 25]. Furthermore, fully transformed cells 
and tumors do not lose their dependence on p62, i.e. they 
become “addicted” to p62, a phenomenon known as non-
oncogene addiction [26]. Accordingly, depletion of p62 
suppressed growth of cancer cells in vitro and tumors in 
vivo in [27, 28].
Importantly, unlike tumor cells, p62 is dispensable 
for normal cells since p62 knockout animals are normally 
developed and demonstrate only minor anomalies (later-
onset obesity) [29]. This indicates that, at least under 
normal conditions, other proteins can substitute some 
functions of p62 (e.g., p62 homolog NBR1 in autophagy) 
[30]. All these properties make p62 an excellent target for 
anticancer drug development. However, to our knowledge, 
there is only one study on chemically targeting p62 using 
XRK3F2 compound for treatment of myeloma [31]. The 
problem with targeting p62 by a drug is that it is multi-
domain protein having at least 8 putative domains, and 
their roles in cancer are far from clear. In case of myeloma 
it is ZZ domain targeted by XRK3F2 appear to be 
important for their growth [31]. 
We have created a p62-encoding DNA vaccine. We 
found that p62 vaccine can generate immune response to 
p62 antigen [12], and anti-tumor response requires intact 
immune system since it lack in immunodeficient SCID 
mice (in preparation). Accordingly, in our study in dogs 
with spontaneous breast cancer we observed accumulation 
of T-lymphocytes within tumors [15]. We found that 
p62 vaccine has a broad range of anticancer activity in 
preclinical models of breast, lung carcinoma, melanoma 
and sarcoma [12]. Importantly, we also demonstrated p62 
activity in spontaneous breast tumor in dogs [15]. Besides 
suppressing growth of primary tumors, Elenagen was able 
to markedly decreased development of metastasis [12]. 
We serendipitously uncovered another property of 
p62 plasmid - its ability to suppress chronic inflammation. 
We found that in a model of ovariectomy-induced 
osteoporosis in mice p62 plasmid injection prevented 
generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and suppressed 
osteoporosis [13]; similarly, p62 alleviated inflammation 
and obesity caused by high-fat diets in rats (in preparation). 
It is well-known that chronic inflammation can play 
immune-suppressive role [32, 33] [34]. Furthermore, 
similar to p62 levels, elevated levels of inflammatory 
markers associated with worse survival, e.g., in breast 
[35] [36] and ovarian cancer [37] [38]. We hypothesize 
that, besides evoking immune response to a cancer antigen 
(like other vaccines), Elenagen can also alleviate chronic 
inflammation within a tumor thus enhancing the response. 
As a result of such dual action, p62 vaccine can be more 
potent than traditional vaccines.
The main goal of the present clinical trial was to 
assess Elenagen safety. Here we report that Elenagen 
demonstrated good safety profile (Table 2). Although 
patients selected for the phase I safety study were so called 
“terminal patients”, Elenagen still showed efficiency in 
breast cancer, having effect in all 3 subtypes of it (Table 
4). Also, it was effective in ovary, lung, renal cancer and 
melanoma (Table 4). Applied as a monotherapy, Elenagen 
cased stabilization of disease for up to 32 wks in some 
patients with breast, ovary and renal cancer, although in 
most patients tumor stabilization was lasted for only 8 
wks. 
If we compare the results of this trial with other 
recent phase I/II trials of other immune-therapeutics 
(Supplementary Table S3), we can make several

conclusions. First, Elenagen, similar to antibodies 
and other vaccines, and anti-CTLA4, in contrast to 
conventional therapeutics, does not evoke objective 
response (i.e. complete + partial response), but produces 
tumor control better than most other vaccines, antibodies, 
or anti-CTLA4 (Supplementary Table S3). Second, anti-
PD1/PDL1 antibodies are more effective than other 
immune-therapeutics, but they however, have more severe 
side effects (Supplementary Table S3). But regarding 
specifically breast and ovarian cancers, Elenagen efficacy 
in tumor control is compatible with anti-PD1/anti-PDL1, 
but have much better safety (Supplementary Table S3). 
During the trial we observed a phenomenon which, 
to our knowledge, has not been described in clinics 
before. When patients with breast and ovarian cancer 
were pretreated with Elenagen, they restored, at least 
partially, their sensitivity to conventional chemotherapy 
which they previously failed (Table 5, 6). There are 
several possible explanations for such effect. First, chemo-
radiotherapy (e.g., doxorubicin) can enhance anti-p62 
immune response by killing tumor cells via immunogenic 
cell death [21, 39]. Second, it is currently becoming 
evident that conventional chemo-radiotherapy, besides 
killing tumor cells directly, can also modulate immune 
response. For instance, cyclophosphamide, 5-fluorouracil, 
cisplatin can target immunosuppressive regulatory T and 
myeloid-derived cells, just enhancing immune response. 
Preconditioning vaccine and CAR-T therapies with these 
“chemotherapeutic” agents is already in clinical use [19-
21] . Furthermore, some drugs such as gemcitabine and 
taxanes can directly stimulate immune system [39]. For 
instance, a vaccine directed to Her2-expressing mouse 
mammary tumors was potentiated by doxorubicin and 
paclitaxel [40]. Accordingly, treatment with doxorubicin 
after vaccination increased immune response to Her2 
vaccine in clinics [41], and in patients with other tumors, 
chemotherapy applied after vaccination was more effective 
than vaccines or chemotherapy alone [42, 43]. 
Although Elenagen alone demonstrated anti-tumor 
activity in a range of solid tumors, in future trials we 
consider its combination with chemo-radiotherapy. We 
also believe that Elenagen should be synergistic with 
immune-checkpoint inhibitors. Combining immune 
checkpoint blockers (ICB) with vaccines targeting 
specific cancer antigens is an emerging approach [44]. 
So far, cancer vaccines are mostly failed in clinical trials 
because immune response they generate was apparently 
too weak to control tumor growth in patients owing to 
immuno-suppressive tumor microenvironment (e.g., due 
to activation of immune checkpoints). If so, one may 
expect that removing immune checkpoint blockade by ICB 
would enhance vaccine efficiency. Indeed, in preclinical 
models of cancer ICB significantly enhanced vaccine 
efficiency [45] [46]. Partially because of these findings, 
cancer vaccine field demonstrates resurgence [47], and 
there are currently several clinical trial of vaccine-ICB 
combination, e.g. with Prostvac, GVAX, CEA/MUC 
etc [44]. We believe that p62-encoding DNA vaccine 
Elenagen is a promising candidate within this booming 
area of research.

and Good Clinical Practice Guidelines. It was approved by 
Ethics Committee and registered by Russian Ministry of 
Health on 09.09.2014 (Clinical trial #506, Protocol E001).
It was also approved by local ethic committee 
of each participating institutions and written informed 
consent for participation in the study was obtained from 
all participants.
Patients and study design
This multi-center, non-randomized, open-label, 
phase I/IIa trial was conducted in cohorts of patients with 
advanced metastatic solid tumors whose diagnosis was 
confirmed histologically. Inclusion/exclusion criteria for 
the patients in the study are presented in Supplementary 
Table S2. Only patients with radiologically measurable 
diseases after exhaustion of standard treatment options 
and in progression were enrolled into the study. The 
study consisted of two parts. The first part was dose-
escalation study: 3 cohorts of patients with 5 patients in 
each received doses of 1, 2.5 and 5 mg, respectively. The 
second part was the expansion study containing 12 patients 
each receiving 1 mg dose. Each patient has received 5 i.m. 
injections of Elenagen (at concentration of 2.5 mg/ml in 
saline) once a week and then followed for 3 weeks before 
assessment of disease. If a patient demonstrated lack of 
disease progression, Elenagen injections were continued 
until tumor/metastases relapse. Standard regimens of 
chemotherapy were administered to 10 patients with breast 
or ovarian cancers, who either did not respond to Elenagen 
or demonstrated disease progression after a stabilization 
period on Elenagen treatment (s). 
Safety assessment
Screening and baseline assessments included 
evaluation of demographic data, medical and history, 
prior medications, a complete physical examination, 
vital signs, Karnofsky performance status, ECG, and 
clinical laboratory tests (including urinalysis and a serum 
pregnancy test if applicable), tumor history, primary 
diagnosis, and previous treatments. Safety assessments 
were performed after each injection. Adverse events

(AE) severity was assessed according to the Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE), 
version 3.0. Safety assessments consisted of monitoring 
and recording all AEs; documenting concomitant 
medications; regular monitoring of hematology, blood 
chemistry, and urine values; periodic measurement of 
vital signs, Karnofsky performance status, ECGs; and 
performance of physical examinations. An ECG was 
recorded for each patient at screening, then 1 and 3 days 
after each dosing, and at the final visit. AE screenings and 
laboratory tests were performed weekly or as clinically 
indicated. Additionally, to assess inflammation and auto-
immune response, CRP levels and antibody to dsDNA 
were measured, respectively, every week.
Tumor response
Tumor measurements were assessed by computed 
tomography (CT) and evaluated at the centers using 
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), 
version 1.1. Assessments were conducted at baseline 
and then 8 weeks after the start of the treatments; in 
case of tumor stabilization, monitoring was continued 
every 8 weeks (5 weekly injections followed by 3 weeks 
observation treatment) till tumor progression. Tumor 
response was defined as complete response (CR), partial 
response (PR), stable disease (SD), or disease progression 
(PD). SD was defined as to be maintained for 8 weeks 
and durable SD for more than 24 weeks. Clinical benefit 
was defined as CR, PR, and durable SD for more than 24 
weeks.
