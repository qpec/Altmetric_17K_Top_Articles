Abstract
Aedes aegypti is the primary vector of several medically relevant arboviruses including den-
gue virus (DENV) types 1–4. Ae. aegypti transmits DENV by inoculating virus-infected
saliva into host skin during probing and feeding. Ae. aegypti saliva contains over one hun-
dred unique proteins and these proteins have diverse functions, including facilitating blood
feeding. Previously, we showed that Ae. aegypti salivary gland extracts (SGEs) enhanced
dissemination of DENV to draining lymph nodes. In contrast, HPLC-fractionation revealed
that some SGE components inhibited infection. Here, we show that D7 proteins are
enriched in HPLC fractions that are inhibitory to DENV infection, and that recombinant D7
protein can inhibit DENV infection in vitro and in vivo. Further, binding assays indicate that
D7 protein can directly interact with DENV virions and recombinant DENV envelope protein.
These data reveal a novel role for D7 proteins, which inhibits arbovirus transmission to ver-
tebrates through a direct interaction with virions.
Author Summary
Dengue virus (DENV) is transmitted to humans by Aedes aegypti during the blood feeding
process. During blood feeding, DENV and saliva proteins are inoculated into human skin.
D7 proteins are prevalent and immunogenic proteins present in Ae. aegypti saliva, and
assist the blood feeding process by scavenging biogenic amines. Previous data suggests
that antibodies against D7 protein from Culex spp. can increase West Nile virus infection.
We hypothesized that D7 proteins may also have antiviral activity. Here, we show that
recombinant Ae. aegypti D7 protein can inhibit DENV infection in vitro and in vivo, and
that D7 can bind to DENV virions.

 Introduction
Dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-borne arbovirus that is transmitted primarily by the species
Aedes aegypti. The global burden of DENV has grown dramatically in the last few decades [1, 2].
We now expect approximately one hundred million clinically recognized cases of disease each
year. Targeted therapeutics do not exist. Fortunately, conventional vaccines are in development
and regulatory approval has been granted in a few countries. Development of a conventional
DENV vaccine has been difficult due to the co-circulation of four serotypes [3, 4]. It is critical
that conventional vaccines elicit robust antibody titers to avoid antibody-dependent enhance-
ment, which occurs during a sub-neutralizing response. It is theoretically possible to target mos-
quito saliva or midgut proteins to block either transmission or acquisition of DENV [3, 5, 6].
This strategy would not be subject to antibody-dependent enhancement or viral genetic drift.
Ae. aegypti saliva contains over one hundred unique proteins that have been classified as D7
proteins, phosphatidylethanolamine binding proteins, odorant and juvenile hormone binding
proteins, serpins and other protease inhibitors, a sialokinin vasodilator, nucleotidases, serine
proteases, sugar digestion related proteins and other enzymes, lectins, angiopoietins, anti-
microbial proteins and peptides, mucins and peritrophins, antigen 5 proteins, and many more
proteins of unknown function [7–11]. Functional data is not available for the majority of these
proteins, although it is expected that the saliva of all hematophagous arthropods have anti-
coagulant, anti-platelet, and vasodilatory activities. It is also likely that saliva proteins serve to
reduce host inflammation and prevent infection.
In addition to the normal physiological roles of hematophagous arthropod saliva, many vec-
tor-borne microorganisms have enhanced fitness in the presence of arthropod saliva. Arthro-
pod saliva can enhance infectivity of West Nile virus, DENV, Rift Valley fever virus, and
Powassan virus, among others [5, 12–18]. The exact mechanism of saliva-mediated infectivity
enhancement is not known, although prior literature suggests that saliva proteins may locally
modify the immune system in favor of arbovirus replication and/or stimulate dissemination by
enhancing migration of target cells to draining lymph nodes [3]. Interestingly, individual saliva
components can have inhibitory activities against arbovirus infection. For instance, the colla-
gen-binding protein aegyptin decreased DENV infection in vivo [19]. Additionally, previous
literature showed that vaccination of mice with a recombinant D7 protein from Culex spp.
enhanced mortality in a West Nile virus mouse model, suggesting that D7 protein may be
inhibitory in vivo [20]. Structural studies suggest that D7 proteins can simultaneously bind bio-
genic amines and cysteinyl leukotrienes, which is likely involved in preventing the host inflam-
matory response [21, 22]. Prevention of the host inflammatory response may reduce influx or
activation of target cells.
Our previous work relied on high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to fraction-
ate Ae. aegypti salivary gland extracts (SGEs) [5]. HPLC fractions were tested to see if they had
virus enhancing or blocking activities in vitro. Here, we identified a number of fractions that
inhibited DENV cell binding and then pooled these fractions for downstream tandem liquid
chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC+MS/MS) analysis. D7 proteins were the most
abundant proteins in the inhibitory fractions. We synthesized a recombinant D7 protein and
found that it inhibited DENV infection in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, the D7 protein inter-
acted directly with DENV virions and recombinant envelope protein. These data support a
model whereby D7 proteins inhibit DENV infection through two independent mechanisms: (i)
direct binding and neutralization of DENV virions, and (ii) inhibition of immune cell infiltra-
tion or activation, which reduces the number of permissive target cells. Characterization of
virus-vector-host interactions at the transmission interface will further development of arthro-
pod-based therapeutics and transmission-blocking vaccines.

 Methods
Mosquito rearing and saliva material collection
Aedes aegypti were provided by staff at the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station. Mosqui-
toes were maintained in a sugar solution at 27°C and 80% humidity according to standard rearing
procedures. Salivary glands and saliva were isolated as described previously [5]. Salivary gland
extracts were prepared by placing 100 salivary glands in 100 μl sterile phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS), freeze-thawing by placing on dry ice three times, and then removing insoluble debris by
centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 10 min. Saliva was isolated using the immersion oil technique.
Cell culture and virus stocks
Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and a human monocyte-like (U937) cell line from the
American Type Culture Collection were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium
(DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics at 37°C with 5% CO2 (Gibco). C6/
36 cells were maintained in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum, tryptose phosphate,
and antibiotics at 30°C. DENV2 was passaged in C6/36 cells. DENV2 New Guinea C strain was
obtained from the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station and C6/36 cells were a kind
gift from Erol Fikrig. Approximately 1 × 105 genome equivalents (GE) were used for in vitro
infections of MEFs and U937 cells.
HPLC fractionation and LC+MS/MS
One hundred salivary glands were dissected from female Ae. aegypti and placed in 100 μl PBS.
The sample was freeze-thawed three times at −80°C, and insoluble debris was pelleted by cen-
trifugation at 5,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was reserved. SGE was either processed
directly for LC+MS/MS analysis or fractionated by high-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC) on a nonporous reverse-phase column with a TFA buffer system into 80 100-μl frac-
tions. Ten μl of each fraction was diluted into 90 μl PBS and used as SGE treatments for in vitro
SGE-mediated cell binding assays as stated below. The remaining 90 μl from inhibitory frac-
tions 31–49 were pooled and submitted for liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry
(LC+MS/MS) analysis.
Proteins were digested with trypsin and analyzed using LC+MS/MS on a Thermo Scientific
LTQ-Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer using Waters nanoACQUITY ultra-high-pressure liquid
chromatographs (UPLC) for peptide separation. MS/MS spectra were searched in-house using
the Mascot algorithm for uninterpreted MS/MS spectra after using the Mascot Distiller pro-
gram to generate Mascot-compatible files. An A. aegypti database was used for searching. The
Keck Biotechnology Resource at Yale University performed both HPLC and LC+MS/MS.
In vitro cell binding assay
MEFs were seeded at 25,000 cells/well in 48-well plates and grown to approximately 70% con-
fluence overnight. Medium was aspirated, and cells were washed with PBS. Ten μl of HPLC
fractions were diluted in a total volume of 100 μl PBS and inoculated into cells at room temper-
ature for 10 min. Saliva material was removed, and then Approximately 1 × 105 GE of DENV2
was inoculated into cells in a total volume of 500 μl for 1 h at 37°C. Unbound virus was then
removed, and fresh medium was added. Infections progressed for up to 18 h. Total RNA was
extracted using RNeasy kits (Qiagen).
For analysis of relative DENV vRNA, total RNA was harvested using RNeasy kits (Qiagen).
Amplification of both the viral target and reference gene target was performed using a duplex
format in 0.2-ml, 96-well PCR plates (Bio-Rad) with a total reaction volume of 25 μl. Reverse

 transcription and quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) were performed in the same closed tube with
250 ng of total RNA per reaction using the Quantitect RT-PCR kit (Qiagen).
All primers were used at a final concentration of 4 μM and were synthesized by the Keck
Facility at Yale University. DENV2 vRNA was amplified using F 5’ CCACTGCCTCTG-
GAAAACTC 3’ and R 5’ GTACCAGCACCCATCCTCAC 3’ primers. Primers were developed
using Gene Link Software (OligoAnalyzer 1.2 and OligoExplorer 1.2). All RT-qPCRs were per-
formed using an iQ5 machine (Bio-Rad). Cycling conditions were 50°C for 30 min (reverse
transcription) and 95°C for 15 min, followed by 42 cycles of 94°C for 15 s and 54.5°C for 1
min. Relative quantities of viral target cDNA were determined using REST software.
Cloning
Ae. aegypti total cellular RNA was converted to cDNA using random primers and the Superscript
III First-Strand Synthesis System (ThermoFisher). Long form D7 protein (AAEL006424) was
amplified using F 5’ GGAGGTACCGATGAAGCTGCCTCTATTACTCGCAATAGTTAC 3’ and
R 5’ GGAGCGGCCGCAATTGTGGACACTGTTTACCGTCG 3’ primers and cloned into the
pMT/BiP/V5-His A plasmid via BamHI and NotI restriction sites. pMT/BiP/D7/V5-His A and
pCoHygro plasmids were transfected into S2 cells using the calcium phosphate method according
to manufacturers’ instructions (ThermoFischer) and a stable cell line was generated through
hygromycin selection. D7 synthesis and secretion was induced by treating cells with copper sulfate
according to manufacturer’s instructions (ThermoFisher). D7 expression was confirmed by Coo-
massie Blue gel staining and Western blot using an anti-6 His antibody. Supernatants were also
harvested from uninduced S2 cell supernatants and used as negative controls.
In vitro infectivity assay
D7 protein was purified using HisPur Cobalt Spin Columns (Thermo Scientific/Pierce, MA)
according to manufacturer instructions. There were a total of 3 washes and 3 elutions. Samples
were stored at -80°C until use. The U937 cell line (ATCC, VA) was used for the in vitro infec-
tion studies. The cells were grown at 37°C and 5% CO2 in DMEM supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum (Gemini, CA), and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. D7 was used in 1/10, 1/100,
and 1/1000 dilutions in complete media for final concentrations of 8, 0.8, and 0.08 ng/mL,
respectively. Dilutions were added for pretreatment of cells in a total volume of 250 μL. Cells
were then incubated for 1 hour at 37°C and then DENV was added to cells at a multiplicity of
infection (MOI) of 1.0. For simultaneous treatments, ten-fold dilutions of D7 were mixed with
DENV2 and these mixtures were pre-incubated for 1 hour at 37°C. D7-DENV2 mixtures were
then inoculated onto cells. Unbound virions were removed by washing after 1 hour and then
cells were incubated for 24 hours at 37°C. RNA was isolated from cells and qRT-PCR per-
formed as described above. DENV2 vRNA was amplified using Forward: 5’ CAG ATC TCT
GAT GAA TAA CCA ACG 3’ and Reverse: 5’ CAT TCC AAG TGA GAA TCT CTT TGT CA
3’ primers. Human B2M RNA was amplified using Forward: 5’ CTC CGT GGC CTT AGC
TGT G 3’ and Reverse: 5’ TTT GGA GTA CGC TGG ATA GCC T 3’ primers.
Ethics statement
Animals were maintained and procedures were performed in accordance with the recommen-
dations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Research
Council. Protocol 14051879 was approved by the University of Pittsburgh's IACUC committee.
Approved euthanasia criteria were based on weight loss and morbidity.

 In vivo infectivity assay
Mice deficient in receptors for type I and type II interferons, (IFNAGR-/-, AGB6) were bred
under specific pathogen-free conditions. Groups of 4-5-week-old, age-matched, mixed-sex
AGB6 mice were inoculated subcutaneously into both rear footpads with 20 μl containing either
107 genome equivalents (GE) of either DENV2 alone or DENV2 plus recombinant D7 protein.
DENV2 alone samples contained purified S2 cell supernatant without D7 protein as a vehicle
control. Forty-eight hours post-infection, mice were euthanized and left and right foot pads and
left and right popliteal draining lymph nodes (DLN) were collected independently. Total RNA
was extracted using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen). qRT-PCR was performed by adding equal amounts
of RNA into each reaction and data were normalized to the actin reference gene. Mouse actin
RNA was amplified using Forward: 5’ GGC TGT ATT CCC CTC CAT CG 3’ and Reverse: 5’
CCA GTT GGT AAC AAT GCC ATG T 3’ primers. Amplification of targets were performed
using a duplex format in 0.2 ml, 96-well PCR plates (BIO-RAD) with a total reaction volume of
25 μl. Reverse transcription and quantitative PCR were performed in the same closed tube with
100 ng of total RNA per reaction using the Quantitect RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen).
Salivary gland extract-DENV virion binding assay
Seventy μg of anti-dengue virus type II antibody, clone 3H5-1 (Millipore) was covalently cou-
pled to 25 μL amine-active resin according to the Pierce Co-Immunoprecipitation Kit manual
(ThermoFisher Scientific). One hundred μg purified, formaldehyde-inactivated dengue virus
type 2 virions (Microbix) was then mixed with 100 Ae. aegypti salivary gland equivalents and
added to the antibody-containing resin with gentle end-over-end mixing for 2 hr at 4°C.
Unbound proteins were washed away and bound proteins were eluted in a final volume of
50 μL. The experimental details are described in the Pierce Co-Immunoprecipitation Kit man-
ual. Eluted proteins were identified by LC+MS/MS analysis as stated above.
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
High binding 96-well plates were coated overnight at 4°C with a 1:1 dilution of D7 or matrix
metalloproteinase protein (MMP; AAEL003012) in coating buffer (R&D systems) for a 0.01mg/
mL final concentration. The next day, plates were rinsed twice with PBS and blocked with block-
ing buffer (1% BSA in 1XPBST) for 1 h at 37. Plates were incubated with 80μL of DENV 2 strain
186881 (2x105 p.f.u) or recombinant DENV Envelope protein (1μg/mL) (L2 Diagnostics, CT)
overnight at 4°C. Plates were washed three times with buffer (1X PBST+ 0.01% Tween 20) and
incubated with a 1:250 dilution of primary antibody for 1h at 37°C: mouse anti-DENV2 antibody
(MAB10226, Millipore) to detect virus and mouse anti-E antibody (MA1-71251, Pierce) to detect
envelope protein. After washing plates three times, wells were incubated with 100 μL of a 1:1000
dilution of anti-mouse IgG, HRP-linked antibody (Cell Signaling Technologies) and washed after
1h of incubation at 37°C. Reaction was visualized after incubating with 80 μL of TMB. After
3min the reaction was stopped with stop solution (2M Sulfuric acid) and plates were read at
450nm in a Synergy HT plate reader (Biotek Instruments Inc., VT).
Results
Identification of D7 proteins in inhibitory salivary gland extract high
performance liquid chromatography fractions
We previously showed that pre-treatment of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) with sali-
vary gland extract (SGE) increased DENV cell binding [5]. Reverse phase HPLC fractionation
and LC+MS/MS analysis was then used to identify fractions of Ae. aegypti salivary gland

 extract (SGE) that increased DENV vRNA levels associated with mouse embryonic fibroblasts
(MEFs)[5]. During this analysis, we also noted that a cluster of HPLC fractions (i.e., 31–49)
inhibited DENV infection (Fig 1). These fractions were pooled and submitted for LC+MS/MS
analysis and searched against the NCBI Ae. aegypti database to identify the most abundant pro-
teins. Multiple proteins were identified with high score values, although long forms of the D7
protein family were the most prevalent (Table 1). A number of these proteins were not pre-
dicted as secreted proteins that would be present in saliva. To validate the proteins that are
present in saliva and may play a role at the virus-vector-host interface, saliva was harvested
from one hundred Ae. aegypti using the immersion oil technique [23]. Soluble proteins were
extracted from immersion oil using phosphate buffered saline and the sample was submitted
for LC+MS/MS analysis. We confirmed that 7 proteins in the inhibitory fraction are also pres-
ent in saliva (Tables 1 and 2). Three of these proteins were either long or short form D7
proteins.
In a separate experiment, we sought to elucidate proteins that are upregulated in salivary
glands during DENV2 infection. Ae. aegypti were either mock or infected with DENV2 via
blood feeding using an artificial membrane. Twenty salivary glands were isolated from each
group of mosquitoes 14 dpi and equal amounts of protein were loaded on to an SDS-PAGE gel
for one-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue. Multiple
bands were different between mock and DENV2 lanes, but one band appeared significantly
darker in the DENV2-infected lane (Fig 2A). The band from the DENV2-infected lane was
excised and submitted for mass spectrometry. Only four unique Ae. aegypti proteins were

HPLC fractions were used to pre-treat mouse embryonic fibroblasts prior to inoculation with DENV2. Total RNA
was harvested and qRT-PCR was performed 18 hours post-infection. Relative levels of DENV2 were normalized to
GAPDH. An untreated control was set to 1.0 and was placed on the far left of the graph (black bar).

 detected, which included tropomyosin, two long form D7 proteins, and a 34 kDa salivary pro-
tein (Fig 2B). We confirmed that both long and short form D7 proteins and the 34 kDa salivary
protein are upregulated in Ae. aegypti salivary glands at the transcriptional level during
DENV2 infection by assessing previously published RNA Seq data (Table 3) [11].
Recombinant D7 protein inhibits dengue virus in vitro and in vivo
Ae. aegypti D7 proteins are multifunctional and have been shown to bind to cysteinyl leukotri-
enes (cysLT) and biogenic amines with high affinity. Based on the discovery of D7 proteins in
inhibitory HPLC fractions, and of increased D7 protein expression in DENV2-infected salivary
glands, we hypothesized that D7 proteins may bind to additional substrates with varying affini-
ties, and that these interactions inhibit DENV cell binding and infectivity. To test this hypothe-
sis, a recombinant D7 long form protein (AAEL006424) was produced in S2 cells and
harvested from the supernatant at a concentration of 80 ng/mL (Fig 3A and 3B). We deter-
mined if D7 protein was toxic to cells by incubating ten-fold dilutions of D7 protein with
monocyte-like U937 cells for 24 hours followed by analysis using Promega’s CellTox Green
Cytotoxicity Assay. This assay measures membrane integrity that occurs as a result of cell
death. Both positive and negative controls were included. None of the dilutions tested were
toxic to U937 cells at the time point tested (Fig 4A).

 We then tested if D7 protein had antiviral activity in vitro by either pre-incubating U937
cells with ten-fold dilutions of recombinant D7 protein for 1 hour at 37°C prior to inoculation
with DENV2, or incubating ten-fold dilutions of D7 protein with DENV2 for 1 hour at 37°C
prior to co-treatment with D7-DENV2 mixtures. The different treatment strategies were
employed to determine if D7 needed to directly interact with virions for activity. Total RNA
was extracted 24 hpi and the relative amount of DENV2 vRNA was normalized to a house-
keeping gene. Both pre-treatment and co-treatment of recombinant D7 protein and DENV2
significantly reduced DENV2 vRNA levels in U937 cells and there wasn’t a statistical difference
between these two treatment groups (Fig 4B). A post-treatment experiment was also performed
to determine if D7 inhibited DENV at an early time point during infection. In this experiment,
U937 cells were infected with DENV for 24 hours, followed by an 8 hour treatment with ten-
fold dilutions of D7 protein. Total RNA was extracted 48 hpi and the relative amount of
DENV2 vRNA was normalized to a housekeeping gene. This treatment strategy did not signifi-
cantly inhibit DENV infection, suggesting that D7 inhibits DENV at an early time point (Fig
4C). We also tested if an irrelevant His-tagged protein could inhibit DENV infection. Recombi-
nant His-tagged GFP was unable to inhibit DENV infection at the highest concentration tested
for D7 (Fig 4D).

 To determine if recombinant D7 can inhibit DENV2 infection in vivo, we challenged AGB6
mice with DENV2 with and without D7 protein by subcutaneous footpad inoculation. AGB6
mice were chosen because they are highly permissive to DENV2 infection and were a suitable
model for early DENV2 replication and dissemination to draining lymph nodes. Briefly, 2

 groups of 4-5-week-old, age-matched, sex-matched mice were inoculated into a single rear
footpad with 20 μl containing 1 x 107 genome equivalents, DENV2 alone or in combination
with approximately 1 ng recombinant D7 protein. In order to test the impact of D7 treatment
on early replication and dissemination, RNA was harvested from footpads and draining lymph
nodes 48 hpi and qRT-PCR was used to measure the relative levels of DENV2 normalized to
an actin reference gene [5]. D7 protein significantly reduced DENV2 vRNA levels in both the
footpads and draining lymph nodes 24 hpi (Fig 5A and 5B). DENV2 vRNA amplified at Ct val-
ues of 21–24 in footpad samples and 17–19 in draining lymph node samples.
Recombinant D7 protein directly interacts with dengue virions and
envelope protein
Our results suggest that D7 protein can inhibit DENV2 infection in vitro and in vivo, although
it is unclear how D7 protein mediates its antiviral effect. Pre-treatment of U937 cells with
recombinant D7 protein led to a significant decrease in DENV2 infection, suggesting that D7
protein may modulate the host cell. Although, co-treatment of D7 protein with DENV2
appeared to be more effective at preventing cell binding and/or infection of U937 cells. We
hypothesized that D7 protein can interact with multiple substrates including proteins at the

 cell surface and viral proteins. To test this hypothesis, we performed binding assays to deter-
mine if D7 protein can bind to DENV virions and envelope protein.
First, anti-DENV2 antibody, clone 3H5-1 was covalently coupled to 25 μL amine-active
resin in two separate columns. One hundred μg of purified, formaldehyde-inactivated dengue
virus type 2 virions was then mixed with 100 Ae. aegypti salivary gland equivalents and added
to the antibody-containing resin and incubated for 2 hr at 4°C. A negative control column

was used to determine the toxicity of ten-fold dilutions of recombinant D7 protein on U937 cells 24 hours post-treatment. (B) U937
cells were either uninfected (UI), infected with DENV2 alone, pre-treated with 10-fold dilutions of recombinant D7 protein followed by
DENV2 infection, or co-treated with 10-fold dilutions of recombinant D7 protein with concomitant DENV2 infection. Total RNA was
harvested and qRT-PCR was performed 24 hours post-infection. Relative levels of DENV2 were normalized to B2M. (C) U937 cells
were either uninfected (UI), infected with DENV2 alone, or infected followed by post-treatment with 10-fold dilutions of recombinant

infection. Relative levels of DENV2 were normalized to B2M. (D) U937 cells were either uninfected (UI), infected with DENV2 alone,
or pre-treated with recombinant Hig-tagged GFP, representing the highest concentration used for D7 protein followed by DENV2
infection. Total RNA was harvested and qRT-PCR was performed 24 hours post-infection. Relative levels of DENV2 were
normalized to B2M. Data represent averages of at least 3 independent experiments. Student’s t tests were performed to assess
statistical significance between groups.

Unbound proteins were washed away and bound proteins were eluted. Eluted proteins were
identified by LC+MS/MS analysis. Although Mascot scores were low, 8 proteins were identified
that were unique and not in the negative control and three of these were present in saliva
(Tables 2 and 4). This included the long form D7 protein (AAEL006424). To determine if the
proteins we detected were simply correlated with their abundance, we performed LC+MS/MS
analysis on Ae. aegypti salivary gland extracts (Table 5). Although actin and serine protease
inhibitor (serpin) had Mascot scores in the top 3%, Mascot data suggested that the remaining
proteins were less abundant, and that our co-immunoprecipitation data did not simply repre-
sent the most abundant proteins in salivary gland extracts.
To confirm if D7 protein can directly interact with DENV2, we performed an enzyme-
linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) by binding a control MMP protein or recombinant D7
Fig 5. Recombinant D7 protein inhibits DENV2 infection in AGB6 mice. Mice deficient in receptors for type I and type II
interferons, (IFNAGR-/-, AGB6) were inoculated subcutaneously into both rear footpads with 20 μl containing either 107
genome equivalents of either DENV2 alone or DENV2 plus recombinant D7 protein. Forty-eight hours post-infection, mice
were euthanized and left and right foot pads and left and right popliteal draining lymph nodes (DLN) were collected
independently. (A) Total RNA was harvested from footpad tissue and qRT-PCR was performed to assess relative levels of
DENV2 vRNA. Relative DENV2 vRNA was normalized to actin gene expression. (B) Total RNA was harvested from DLNs and
qRT-PCR was performed to assess relative levels of DENV2 vRNA. Relative DENV2 vRNA was normalized to actin gene
expression. 5 mice were present in each group and the data represents a single experiment. Unpaired t tests were performed
to assess statistical significance.

Unbound proteins were then removed by washing each well with buffer. The degree of associa-
tion between immobilized proteins and DENV2 virions was assessed using an antibody that
recognized DENV followed by a secondary antibody conjugated to horse radish peroxidase.
DENV2 16881 virions bound to D7 protein more readily than MMP protein. (Fig 6A). Plates
coated with D7 protein were then incubated with bovine serum albumin, DENV2 16881 viri-
ons, or recombinant DENV2 envelope protein. Unbound proteins were then removed by wash-
ing each well with buffer. The degree of association between D7 and the above proteins was
assessed using an antibody recognizing DENV followed by a secondary antibody conjugated
with horse radish peroxidase. We found that recombinant D7 interacted with both DENV2
16881 virions and recombinant DENV2 envelope protein (Fig 6B).

 Discussion
Hematophagous arthropod saliva contains a complex mixture of proteins with anti-hemostatic,
anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory properties. Hematophagous arthropod saliva can
also enhance transmission of arboviruses, although the exact mechanism and saliva proteins
involved in this process are not known [3]. Interestingly, individual saliva components can
have inhibitory activities that prevent arbovirus infection [19]. Here, we identified D7 protein
in biochemical fractions of salivary gland extracts that inhibited DENV2 cell binding and/or
infection in mouse embryonic fibroblasts and then determined if this activity could be recapit-
ulated with recombinant D7 protein. We found that recombinant D7 protein prevented
DENV2 cell binding and/or infection in two permissive cell types and prevented infection and
dissemination in a mouse model. Additionally, two separate binding assays suggest that D7
protein can physically interact with DENV virions and envelope protein. These data support
the previous observation that D7 protein vaccination enhanced mortality in a West Nile virus
mouse model and suggest that D7 protein inhibits virus transmission [20].
D7 proteins are some of the most abundant proteins expressed in the salivary glands of
blood feeding Diptera. Long and short forms of D7 proteins exist in mosquitoes. Each of these
proteins appear capable of binding either cysteinyl leukotrienes, and/or biogenic amines such
as serotonin, histamine, and norepinephrine. These functions are predicted to antagonize the
host’s inflammatory response, and ability to vasoconstrict, induce platelet-aggregation, and
induce a sense of pain–each critical to efficiently obtaining a blood meal [21, 22].
It is theoretically possible that the functions of D7 proteins are counter to the needs of arbo-
viruses during transmission to a vertebrate host. D7 proteins bind multiple substrates and it is
possible that they bind other proteins with lower affinity, which may limit virus-host interac-
tions. Additionally, limiting the host inflammatory response may reduce influx or activation of
target cells, such as Langerhans cells, monocytes, or macrophage. Our data support that D7
protein mediates its antiviral effect through direct protein-protein interaction in vitro, although
it is possible that modulation of the inflammatory response also occurs in vivo.
D7 proteins are some of the most abundant and immunogenic proteins present in mosquito
saliva [25]. The presence of anti-D7 antibodies has been used as a marker of exposure to certain
mosquito species [26–29]. Considering that individuals who are exposed to mosquitoes have
high levels of anti-D7 antibodies, it is likely that these antibodies inhibit D7 protein function.
In fact, the presence of anti-D7 antibodies has been linked to disease severity [29]. Although
anti-D7 antibodies may prevent efficient blood feeding by a mosquito, it may also enhance dis-
ease transmission and disease severity. Characterizing the complex interplay of virus-vector-
host interactions will lead to the development of better models of pathogenesis, strategies to
limit disease transmission and promote the development of therapeutics, and transmission-
blocking vaccines.
