ABSTRACT
Background and aims
Studies examining the next-day cognitive effects of heavy alcohol consumption have produced
mixed findings, which may reflect inconsistencies in definitions of ‘hangover’. Recent consensus has defined hangover
as ‘mental and physical symptoms, experienced the day after a single episode of heavy drinking, starting when blood
alcohol concentration (BAC) approaches zero’. In light of this, we aimed to review the literature systematically to evaluate
and estimate mean effect sizes of the next-day effects of heavy alcohol consumption on cognition. Methods
Embase,
PubMed and PsycNET databases were searched between December 2016 and May 2018 using terms based on ‘alcohol’
and ‘hangover’. Studies of experimental designs which reported the next-day cognitive effects of heavy alcohol consump-
tion in a ‘hangover’ group with BAC < 0.02% were reviewed. A total of 805 articles were identified. Thirty-nine full-text
articles were screened by two independent reviewers and 19 included in the systematic review; 11 articles provided
sufficient data to be included in the meta-analysis; 1163 participants across 19 studies conducted since 1970 were
included in the analysis. Data for study design, hangover severity, BAC at testing and cognitive performance were
extracted and effect estimates calculated. Results
The systematic review suggested that sustained attention and driving
abilities were impaired during hangover. Mixed results were observed for: psychomotor skills, short- (STM) and long-term
memory (LTM) and divided attention. The meta-analysis revealed evidence of impairments in STM [g = 0.64, 95%
confidence interval (CI) = 0.15–1.13], LTM (Hedges’ g = 0.59, 95% CI = 0.01–1.17) sustained attention (g = 0.47,
95% CI = 0.07–0.87) and psychomotor speed (Hedges’ g = 0.66, 95% CI = 0.31–1.00) during alcohol hangover.
Conclusion
The research literature suggests that alcohol hangovers may involve impaired cognitive functions and
performance of everyday tasks such as driving.
Keywords

INTRODUCTION
Research examining the cognitive effects of alcohol
hangover have produced conflicting findings. While several
studies report impairment in spatial and visual abilities
[1,2], attention [3–7], memory [6,8–11], information
processing speed [3,12], reaction times [8,9,12] and
intellectual processes [1,2], others reveal no clear evidence
that hangover affects cognition [1,5,6,11,13–22]. Tasks
reflecting work-place performance have also produced
mixed results, with impairments in driving [23–26], flying
[27–29] and surgical performance [30–32], but not
managerial decisions [33] or problem-solving in a ship
engine [34].
Disagreements in the definition of alcohol hangover
may contribute to inconstancies with study designs
and measures [35,36]. Some researchers argue that
hangover constitutes any next-day effects following a
night of heavy alcohol consumption, and often do not
measure blood alcohol concentration (BAC) or hangover
at
the
time
of testing.
However,
some
individuals
may be hangover-resistant [37–39], experiencing no
symptoms despite sufficient alcohol to induce hangover.
Indeed, the importance of measuring hangover symp-
toms
is
highlighted
in
a
recent
definition,
which
received consensus from academics in the field. It
states that hangover is a ‘combination of mental and
physical symptoms, experienced the day after a single

 episode of heavy drinking, starting when BAC approaches
zero’ [40].
Peak BAC during a night of ‘heavy’ drinking may
also contribute to conflicting results [35,41]. To induce
a hangover, high amounts of alcohol (> 1 g/kg) are
consumed [42], and the higher the amount the more
severe are the cognitive impairments [5]. Hangovers
are studied using either an experimental approach,
where an alcohol challenge is administered, or using
the naturalistic approach, where participants consume
alcohol at a time and place typical for the individual.
In experimental studies, hangover may not be induced
reliably, as practical and ethical issues could prevent
doses > 1 g/kg being administered—again highlighting
the need to include measures of hangover in order to
validate the hangover condition. Conversely, naturalistic
studies have reported alcohol consumption at approxi-
mately 1.6 g/kg [9] yet, unlike experimental studies,
do not allow for the control of extraneous variables
(e.g.
food).
Although
naturalistic
and
experimental
methods may reveal different impairments, it is impor-
tant to assess convergence of findings across these differ-
ent methodologies [43,44].
Previous reviews have highlighted other methodo-
logical limitations which contribute to conflicting find-
ings,
preventing
firm
conclusions
[36,41,45–47].
These include; no BAC measurement at testing, no
counterbalance to avoid order effects and poor controls
of potentially confounding factors. These reviews ex-
cluded studies with BAC > 0 at testing [36,41,46].
However, alcohol hangover starts when BAC is ap-
proaching zero [40], indicating that these reviews
may have excluded potentially informative studies. As
acute intoxication can produce cognitive effects at
BAC > 0.02%, studies which include participants above
this threshold cannot disassociate hangover from acute
intoxication effects.
The perspective taken here is that BAC should be
< 0.02% at testing and hangover symptoms should be
measured to validate the hangover condition. However,
we acknowledge that, despite mean scores indicating
higher hangover severity in hangover conditions, individ-
uals within these groups may not experience hangover
symptoms. As separate analysis is not typically reported
for those with and without hangover following heavy
alcohol consumption, this review should be regarded as
examining next-day effects of heavy alcohol consumption.
We acknowledge that hangover has also been explored in
animal models; however, the translational value of this
work is currently unclear, and so only human studies are
included in this review.
To our knowledge, there have been no previous system-
atic reviews that have estimated mean effect sizes in a
meta-analysis. This review aims to critically evaluate and
estimate mean effect sizes to explore the next-day cognitive
effects of heavy alcohol consumption.
METHODS
Search strategy and inclusion criteria
A literature search was conducted from December 2016–
May 2018 to identify studies examining the cognitive
effects of alcohol hangover. PubMed, Embase and PsycNET
were searched using the strategy ‘alcohol’ OR ‘ethanol’ OR
‘alcohol intoxication’ OR ‘alcohol drinking patterns’ AND
‘hangover’ OR ‘next day effects’. Search terms were
adapted for each database and references searched for
additional articles. Articles were screened by two indepen-
dent reviewers and disagreements resolved by discussion in
the first instance. If consensus was not reached, a third
reviewer was consulted. The inclusion criteria for studies
were developed based upon the consensus on hangover
research report [48]. Only studies that examined healthy
human adults (18+ years of age) and contained a no-
hangover control condition were included in the review.
Studies had to include a measure which validated the
presence of hangover, such as a questionnaire assessing
symptoms, and were required to report a BAC < 0.02%
at testing. The inclusion criteria were based on a stringent
set of criteria for hangover; however it is acknowledged
that other approaches may be more inclusive of studies
(e.g. including studies which do not include a measure of
hangover or BAC at testing).
Data extraction
Data were extracted from included studies for study design,
cognitive tasks, hangover measurement and BAC during
hangover. Where possible, quantitative data were extracted
and effect estimates calculated [49,50]. Tasks were
coded into their corresponding cognitive components
[51]. Components and their subcategories comprised:
attention/vigilance
(selective,
sustained,
divided
and
vigilance attention), memory [working memory (WM),
short-term
memory
(STM)
and
long-term
memory
(LTM)] and psychomotor (speed and accuracy).
Data analysis
All meta-analyses were performed using RevMan [52].
Hedges’ g effect size estimates were calculated [18,19]
for each outcome. For those studies with multiple
outcomes in each category of cognition, effect sizes were
averaged so that no study carried undue weight in
determining overall effect. The weight given to each study
was the inverse of the variance of the effect size, thus
larger studies with smaller standard errors were given
more weight.

 RESULTS
Identification of studies
Agreement
between
reviewers
was
95%
with
two
‘disagreements’ which were resolved through discussion,
without the need to consult a third reviewer. In one case,
upon both reviewers revisiting the paper, it was clear that
the paper did not measure hangover. In the other case,
inclusion criteria for one study were reported across two
papers. The reviewers agreed that the inclusion criteria
were met by collating data from both papers.
The literature search identified 19 studies that could
be included in the systematic review [1,2,4–9,11,12,17–
19,23–25,33,34,53], and 11 with sufficient data to be
included in the meta-analysis [1,5–9,11,12]. Of the 20
articles excluded during full text screening, 12 studies
failed to measure hangover at testing, two of which [30]
were reported in the same article [21,27–29,31,32,54–
57]. Two studies, which included measures on subjective
feelings during hangover, only found increases in fatigue
or arousal [14,20], therefore it was unclear if participants
were experiencing a hangover. Seven studies failed to
measure BAC at testing [3,10,27,29,30,54,58], and two
studies which did measure BAC showed that participants
achieved BAC > 0.02% [21,26]. Two studies included
other treatments in their research design [20,59]. To
avoid interference from either the substance or the pla-
cebo effect, these studies were excluded. Finally, a further
study was excluded [60], as the data analysed were al-
ready included in this review via another article from
the same authors [9]. Figure 1 represents a PRISMA (Pre-
ferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-
Analyses) diagram of study exclusion. Assuming studies
which did not report participant attrition did not experi-
ence any, total participants recruited across all included
studies was 1163. The total number of participants for
which data were reported was 846, an attrition rate of
27.3%.
Included studies
A total of 19 studies were included in the qualitative
synthesis, as illustrated in Table 1. The 11 laboratory stud-
ies [1,2,4–6,11,17,18,33,34,53] typically administered
lower doses of alcohol than were consumed during the
eight naturalistic drinking studies [7–9,11,12,19,23–25].
Ten
studies
explored
multiple
aspects
of
cognition
[1,2,5,7–9,11,18,19]. Risk of bias was assessed using
RevMan ([56]; see Fig. 2). One study did not randomize
sufficiently to condition [2], and for all studies it was

 unclear whether there was bias for selective reporting due
to a lack of study pre-registration. Fifty per cent of studies
were at risk of other biases, including non-randomization
of task administration and sampling biases. Blinding was
not considered a risk of bias as participants readily guess
conditions
during
experimental
hangover
research,
despite blinding [5,6].
Attention
Sustained attention
Five studies explored sustained attention, three labora-
tory [1,5,6] and two naturalistic [7,19]. Howland et al.
[6], McKinney et al. [7] and Rohsenow et al. [5] reported
impairments, whereas Finnigan et al. [19] and Mrysten
et al. [1] showed no evidence of next-day effects on
sustained attention. Two studies used tasks from a
tool validated for assessing cognitive impairments: the
neurobehavioural
evaluation
system-3
[5,6,61],
two
used a sustained attention task which presented stimuli
at a consistent rate and participants responded to con-
secutive stimuli [7,19], and one used a ‘correction test’
where participants marked identical rows in a list of
two columns [1]. Four studies provided sufficient infor-
mation to be included in the meta-analysis [1,7], which
revealed an overall impairment in sustained attention
during hangover [Hedges’ g = 0.47, 95% confidence
interval (CI) = 0.07–0.87, I2 = 50%]. This is shown
graphically in Fig. 3.
Divided attention
Five studies included measures of divided attention
[4,7,17–19]. Of these, one (with a small sample size;
n = 5) reported impairments in divided attention [4]. The
four other studies showed no evidence of a next-day effect
on divided attention. Four studies were included in a
meta-analysis [4,7,17,18] which showed no evidence of a
next-day effect on divided attention.
Other attention
Verster et al. [11] analysed vigilance using the Macworth
clock test and found no evidence of next-day effects.
McKinney et al. [7] found slowed reaction times (RT) for
both near and far distractors in a selective attention task,
and increased interference the day after heavy alcohol
consumption in the Stroop test. As only one study explored
Figure 2 Risk of bias graph. One study was at risk of insufficient randomization procedures; all studies were at risk of reporting bias as there were no
pre-registered study protocols, and 50% of studies were at risk of biases such as non-randomized task order and sampling bias. [Colour figure can be

 vigilance and only one explored selective attention, a
meta-analysis was not performed for these categories of
attention.
Memory
Short-term memory
Short-term memory (STM) was assessed in seven studies
[5,6,8,9,11,18,19], three naturalistic [8,9,19] and four
laboratory [5,6,11,18]. McKinney & Coyle [8,9] and
Howland et al. [6] reported impairments, with Howland
et al. showing a female only impairment, whereas Collins
& Chiles [18], Finnigan et al. [19], Rohsenow et al. [5]
and Verster et al. [11] reported no evidence of a next-day
effect. Three studies used a word recall task [8,9,11], one
used a similar task which measured probed recall [19],
two used a pattern memory test [5,6] and one used a
‘pattern identification task’ [18]. Five studies provided
sufficient information to be included in the meta-analysis
[6,8,9,11,18] which, as indicated in Fig. 4, revealed an
overall impairment for STM during hangover (Hedges’
g = 0.64, 95% CI = 0.15–1.13, I2 = 73%).
Long-term memory
Four studies, two naturalistic [8,9] and two laboratory
[6,11], assessed LTM. Verster et al. [11] and McKinney &
Coyle [8,9] used a word recall task and reported impair-
ments in LTM. However, in Howland et al. [6], where
participants were required to learn lecture materials
pre-intoxication, there was no evidence of a next-day effect
on LTM. Figure 5 shows that when all four studies were in-
cluded in a meta-analysis there was an overall impairment
in LTMduring hangover (Hedges’ g = 0.59, 95% CI = 0.01–
1.17, I2 = 84%).
Other memory
Howland et al. [6] and Rohsenow et al. [5] investigated
working memory using the adaptive paced auditory serial
addition test (AP
ASAT), the visual span-backwards (VST-B)
and the auditory digit span-backwards (ADS-B). They
found no evidence of a next-day effect in the AP
ASAT or
the ADS-B; however, Howland et al. [6] reported impair-
ments in the VST-B during hangover. Kim et al. [2]
also reported impairments in the memory domain of
the Luria-Nebraska Neurobehavioural Battery (LNNB), al-
though as this domain encompasses STM, LTM and WM
[62], it is unclear which aspects of memory were impaired.
Psychomotor performance
Speed
Psychomotor speed was measured using RT in six studies
[1,8,9,12,18,53].
Three
naturalistic
studies
[8,9,12]
found slower RT the day after an evening of heavy
alcohol consumption, whereas three laboratory studies
found no evidence to support this [1,18,53]. Five studies
[1,8,9,12,18] were included in the meta-analysis which,
as shown in Fig. 6, indicated that psychomotor speed
was slowed the following day (Hedges’ g = 0.66, 95%
CI = 0.31–1.00, I2 = 36%).

 Accuracy
Two studies reported psychomotor accuracy [12,53].
Kruisselbrink et al. [53] found a decrease in psychomotor
accuracy following an evening of heavy alcohol consump-
tion, whereas Grange et al. [12] reported no evidence of an
effect on accuracy
.
‘Real-life’ simulations
Six studies included a ‘real-life’ simulation that required
cognitive performance. Rohsenow et al. [34] reported no
evidence of an effect for solving a mechanical failure during
a simulated ship scenario. Streufert et al. [33] reported no
clear evidence of an effect on performance in scenarios
which require managerial skills, and Howland et al. [6]
reported no evidence of a next-day effect for General
Record Examination scores on two factors; verbal and
quantitative. For studies that analysed driving following
an evening of heavy alcohol consumption [23–25], the
ability to control a vehicle, as measured by deviation from
a set course, was impaired [23,25], whereas there was no
clear evidence to suggest a next-day effect on driving speed
[24]. Due to considerable differences in research methodol-
ogy it was not possible to conduct a meta-analysis for ‘real-
life’ simulations.
DISCUSSION
The systematic review and meta-analyses indicate that
STM, LTM sustained attention and psychomotor speed
are impaired the day after an evening of heavy alcohol con-
sumption. Results were mixed for the impact of next-day ef-
fects on WM, and there was no clear evidence of an effect
on divided attention or vigilance, suggesting that specific
components of cognition are influenced the next day. The
meta-analysis showed that psychomotor speed, STM
and LTM had medium overall effect estimates (Hedges’
g = 0.66, 0.64 and 0.59, respectively), and sustained
attention had a small effect estimate (Hedges’ g = 0.47).
Our systematic review indicated that sustained atten-
tion was impaired in studies using naturalistic and
laboratory methodologies, with meta-analysis revealing
an overall impairment with a small effect size (Hedges’
g = 0.47). For divided attention, only Rohers et al. reported
an impairment [4]; however, the reliability of this study is
potentially limited by the small sample size (n = 5). Meta-
analysis data revealed no evidence of a next-day effect on
divided attention. Next-day impairments in sustained at-
tention may reflect accumulating mental fatigue, induced
by prolonged attentional demands [63]. Fatigue is a com-
mon symptom of hangover [64] and involves reward-cost
trade-offs [65,66]. Therefore, hangover-induced fatigue
may contribute to impairments observed in sustained at-
tention. The lack of clear evidence for an effect in some
studies of sustained attention may reflect insensitivity of
the cognitive task used. Studies which used tasks that have
not previously demonstrated sensitivity to state changes in
drug use [1,17,18] tended to report no evidence of a next-
day effect, whereas studies [7] that used cognitive tasks
that have previously detected state changes [67] were
more likely to report next-day related impairments. Next-
day effects on sustained and divided attention may also
have been masked by low statistical power. For example,
Finnigan et al. [19] had small, unequal group sizes in their
between-subjects design (n = 13, n = 25, n = 33 for ‘acute
and hangover’, hangover and control groups, respectively).
Our review highlights converging evidence from both
methodologies (experimental and naturalistic) that STM
and LTM may be influenced the morning following a night
of heavy alcohol consumption, with the meta-analysis
revealing impairments in both. It is possible that memory
formation, rather than retrieval, may be affected, as
indicated by the differential next-day effects on studies in
which learning took place following heavy alcohol
consumption versus sober state. An important process for
memory formation in the hippocampus is long-term poten-
tiation (LTP)—the strengthening of signals between
neurones [68]. Given the detrimental effect of elevated in-
terleukin (IL)-6 [69–71] and cortisol [72] on LTP [73]
and the increase of these in the morning following heavy
alcohol consumption [74–76], this could be a possible
mechanism underlying next-day related impairment of
memory formation. Three studies examined memory

estimate of 0.66, 95% confidence interval = 0.31–1.00. [Colour figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com]

 processes using a naturalistic methodology, two of which
reported impairments in STM and LTM, whereas Finnigan
et al. [19] reported no evidence of impairments in STM.
However, as mentioned above, this study may have lacked
the statistical power to identify next-day effects. Conversely,
experimental studies have largely reported no evidence of
next-day impairment of memory, although studies where
participants reached higher BACs tended to report impair-
ments [6,11]. As with studies of attention, some studies
that reported no clear evidence of an effect on memory
may have used tasks that are insensitive to the acute
next-day effects.
Systematic review revealed conflicting results for next-
day influences on psychomotor speed. However, when
effect estimates were combined in the meta-analysis,
there was an overall impairment with a medium effect
estimate (Hedges’ g = 0.66). It is important to consider
the suitability of RT as an outcome measure when
assessing the next-day effects on cognition. For example,
Howland et al. [6] and Rohsenow et al. [5] use RT as an
outcome measure in tasks of sustained attention. Both
reveal impairments; however, it is unclear whether the
impairment is related to sustained attention or psychomo-
tor speed. Some cognitive tasks of sustained attention,
which do not use RT as an outcome measure, revealed no
clear evidence of next-day effects on attention [1]. Three
naturalistic studies reported slower RTs, whereas three lab-
oratory studies reported no evidence of an effect, although
Kruisselbrink et al. [53] reported decreased accuracy. Stud-
ies using experimental manipulation of ‘hangover’ typically
administered lower doses of alcohol than studies where
‘hangover’ occurred ‘naturally’ (1.3–1.43 and ~1.54–
1.67 g/kg, respectively), and had smaller sample sizes
(n = 8–12), which may impact reliability [77]. It should
be noted that, due to insufficient information, one labora-
tory study [53] could not be included in the meta-analysis,
which may over-inflate the effect estimate reported.
Three naturalistic studies identified in this review
assessed driving the morning following a night of heavy al-
cohol consumption. Verster et al. and Laurell & Törnros
[23,25] reported impairments in ability to control the vehi-
cle. However, Törnros & Laurell [24] reported no effect on
speed the next day. These studies have important implica-
tions for road safety, especially given that hangover may
contribute to road-traffic accidents [78]. The impairments
observed in ability to drive may be driven by next-day
effects on underlying cognitive components. Driving uses
psychomotor speed and sustained attention [79], both of
which appear to be impaired in this review. Studies using
experimental manipulation of hangover, which assessed
task performance using measures of executive function
(problem-solving and decision-making), as well as aca-
demic performance, all found no clear evidence of a
next-day effect. However, an outcome measure of overall
completion time, as in Rohsenow et al. [34], and the man-
agerial task used in Streufert et al. [33], may not be suffi-
cient to detect next-day effects. Together, these findings
echo the recommendations of previous reviews [36,41],
indicating that further research is needed to determine
hangover effects on executive functions. We also suggest
that future studies of executive function should use vali-
dated measures known to be sensitive to state changes in
drug use, such as the Iowa Gambling Task [80].
In line with previous reviews [35,36,41,46], this sys-
tematic review and meta-analysis revealed several method-
ological issues which limit the interpretation of evidence
from studies of alcohol hangover on cognition. Although
the studies included in this review met rigorous criteria
there was a high degree of variability in the design of
individual studies, possibly reflected by the high level of
heterogeneity observed. Our review highlights that low
sensitivity of tasks to detect next-day impairments may
underlie null next-day effects on cognition. The use of
cognitive tasks sensitive to state changes in substance use
is essential for studies exploring cognitive effects the day
after a night of heavy alcohol consumption [81]. Thought
should also be given to the sensitivity of visual stimuli to
next-day effects, as opposed to auditory stimuli. Studies
using cognitive tasks with auditory stimuli revealed no
evidence of a next-day effect on cognition, in contrast to ef-
fects observed when using visual stimuli. This discrepancy
is supported by evidence of impairments of the ‘visual’
component of the LNNB task battery [2]. Another factor
that may influence the next-day effect on cognition is study
design. Our review suggests a greater likelihood of next-day
impairment in studies of naturalistic design. In studies
where hangover is induced ‘naturally’, alcohol consump-
tion was higher (mean alcohol dose = 1.54 g/kg) than in
experimental studies (mean alcohol dose = 1.21 g/kg).
This finding suggests that higher alcohol doses are associ-
ated with greater next-day performance impairments [82].
Finally, several other limitations should be considered.
One study [2] did not randomize condition order, while
others did not randomize task administration order [7–9].
Randomization to condition is important to prevent prac-
tice effects, and randomizing task order limits confounding
variables such as fatigue. Several studies did not control for
nicotine use [1,17,18], which is known to influence
cognitive performance [83]. Our review also highlighted
variability between study design in the amount of time be-
tween alcohol consumption and cognitive testing, possibly
depriving participants of sleep. Sleep time is an important
consideration when researching cognition, as cognitive
components are affected differentially by sleep loss [84].
Although in real-life drinking some individuals may reduce
sleep time for drinking time [85], variability between
studies for the time allowed for sleep make it difficult to
draw firm conclusions regarding cognitive effects.

 Based on these shortcomings, we make the following
recommendations for future research. First, to address the
shortcoming of low statistical power, studies should con-
duct a priori power analysis to determine an estimate of
required sample sizes. Secondly, studies should adopt tasks
that have been validated and shown to be sensitive to state
changes in drug use. Thirdly, consideration should be given
for the use of RT as an outcome measure in tasks, and
interpretation should acknowledge the potential impact
of next-day psychomotor impairments. Fourthly, future
research should seek to address the paucity of robust
research examining executive functions the morning
following a night of heavy alcohol consumption.
CONCLUSION
To our knowledge, this study is the first to systematically
review the literature exploring next-day effects on cogni-
tive performance and to estimate mean effect sizes. Our
review reveals next-day impairments in STM, LTM, psycho-
motor speed and sustained attention, with mixed findings
for next-day effects on working memory, and no clear evi-
dence of an effect on divided attention. Results from our
meta-analysis indicate medium effect sizes for psychomotor
speed, STM and LTM, and a small effect size for sustained
attention. These findings suggest that specific cognitive
functions may be impaired the morning following a night
of heavy alcohol consumption, with implications for
everyday task performance (e.g. driving).
