ABSTRACT
In December of 2014, an anonymous working group under the
United States’ Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
issued a draft of the first-ever federal recommendations regarding
male circumcision. In accordance with the American Academy of
Pediatrics’ circumcision policy from 2012 – but in contrast to the
more recent 2015 policy from the Canadian Paediatric Society as well
as prior policies (still in force) from medical associations in Europe
and Australasia – the CDC suggested that the benefits of the surgery
outweigh the risks. In this article, we provide a brief scientific and
conceptual analysis of the CDC’s assessment of benefit versus risk,
and argue that it deserves a closer look. Although we set aside the
burgeoning bioethical debate surrounding the moral permissibility
of performing non-therapeutic circumcisions on healthy minors, we
argue that, from a scientific and medical perspective, current
evidence suggests that such circumcision is not an appropriate
public health measure for developed countries such as the United
States.

Introduction
Male circumcision is the surgical removal of part or all of the penile foreskin (Cold &
Taylor, 1999). When circumcision is performed on children in the absence of penile
disease, it raises a number of complex ethical issues, some of which have been discussed
in the recent literature (e.g. Darby, 2015; Earp, 2015a, 2015b; Foddy, 2013; Frisch et al.,
2013; Mazor, 2013; Munzer, 2015; Savulescu, 2013; Ungar-Sargon, 2015). Here,
however, we focus exclusively on the empirical aspects of circumcision as they pertain
to a published draft of the first-ever U.S. government policy on the subject, released in
December of 2014.1 Our central aim is to analyse the contention of the U.S. Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that the prophylactic benefits of non-therapeutic
male circumcision, as carried out prior to an age of consent, outweigh its associated risks

 in developed settings such as the United States, in light of the available evidence pertaining
to this question.
Benefits versus risks
Do the benefits of circumcision outweigh the risks?2 In recently proposed recommen-
dations and an accompanying background report, an anonymous CDC working group
has suggested that they do (2014a, 2014b). A similar claim was made in 2012 by an
eight-member American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) task force (2012a, 2012b),
despite contrary policies from British, mainland European, and Australasian medical
associations, all of which remain in force (e.g. British Medical Association, 2006; Royal
Australasian College of Physicians, 2010; Royal Dutch Medical Association, 2010; see
also National Health Service of England, 2016). In addition, the Canadian Paediatric
Society (CPS), which has historically endorsed the AAP position, instead explicitly rejected
it in its most recent policy (Sorokan, Finlay, & Jefferies, 2015).
What could explain this lack of international agreement with the U.S. view? There are
several possibilities. At least one concerns the fact that ‘The true incidence of compli-
cations after newborn circumcision is unknown’, as acknowledged by the AAP task
force (2012b, p. e772). But since ‘complications’ are one of the foremost risks of circumci-
sion, and since their ‘true incidence’ has not been firmly established (see below), it
becomes difficult to see how the benefits of the surgery could logically be asserted to out-
weigh them (Darby, 2015). This is especially the case given that, on the other side of the
scale, the likelihood as well as the magnitude of the purported benefits of circumcision
themselves are in dispute.
A further possibility has to do with ongoing disagreements over how to define ‘compli-
cations’ in the first place (see AAP, 2012a), as well as with differences of opinion concern-
ing the relative weight or value to assign to individual benefits and risks. As AAP task force
member Dr Andrew L. Freedman stated in a recent editorial, in addition to having ‘insuf-
ficient information about the actual incidence and burden of nonacute complications’, the
AAP’s 2012 assessment of benefits versus risks also suffered due to the ‘lack of a univer-
sally accepted metric to accurately measure or balance the risks and benefits’ (Freedman,
2016, p. 1).
To see the significance of this problem, which applies equally to the 2014 analysis by the
CDC, consider the example of a modest reduction in the absolute risk of contracting
certain sexually transmitted infections, a health benefit that is frequently attributed to –
primarily adult – circumcision (see below). Considering that (1) children are not at risk
of contracting sexually transmitted infections prior to sexual debut (an event that typically
comes after the development of a capacity to provide informed consent to self-affecting
interventions); (2) there are alternative modes of prevention that are less invasive, as
well as less risky and more effective, than circumcision (i.e. safe sex practices when one
does become sexually active); and (3) many of these infections can be treated effectively
if they do occur, what is the weight or value that one should assign to this particular
benefit?
For example, should it be considered ‘worth’ the risk, however slight, of a surgical
mishap that causes permanent damage to the penile glans? Is it ‘worth’ the loss of the
penile prepuce itself, which is a 100% risk of circumcision? Is it ‘worth’ the risk of

 removing too much penile skin (i.e. more than was intended), leading to painful erections
later in life (see e.g. van Duyn & Warr, 1962; Krill, Palmer, & Palmer, 2011; Thorup,
Thorup, & Ifaoui, 2013)? The answer to these questions cannot be ‘objectively’ determined
(see Johnsdotter, 2013). Instead, they will depend upon such factors as how much value
one places on having intact versus modified genitalia, how willing one is to engage in
safe sex practices (even if one is circumcised), and how much risk one feels comfortable
taking on when it comes to a surgery performed on a physically and symbolically sensitive
part of one’s body (Adams & Moyer, 2015, p. 723; see also Earp, 2016).3
Finally, it has been argued that the appropriate counterbalance to the potential benefits
of circumcision is not only the risk of surgical complications (whatever those turn out to
be), but also its short-term, intermediate, and long-term adverse consequences, both phys-
ical and psychological (Darby, 2015). Due to a lack of adequate research into these ques-
tions, however, the entire spectrum of potential circumcision harms (i.e. surgical risks plus
additional negative consequences) has never been fully described. Moreover, at least some
of these potential harms are likely to be subjective in nature (e.g. feelings of loss or resent-
ment; see Darby & Cox, 2009; Goldman, 1999; Hammond, 1999), and therefore highly
variable across individuals, as well as difficult to quantify in a meaningful way (Darby,
2015; Darby & Cox, 2009; Johnsdotter, 2013).
The contention of the CDC
Notwithstanding all of the concerns just mentioned, in support of its contention that the
benefits of circumcision do in fact outweigh the risks, the CDC working group cites a
review article first-authored by a retired molecular geneticist named Brian J. Morris
(Morris, Bailis, & Wiswell, 2014a). As noted previously in this journal, Morris is ‘a
long-standing advocate of mass circumcision’ (Bell, 2015, p. 558), who now serves as
the primary spokesperson for a pro-circumcision lobbying organisation called the Cir-
cumcision Academy of Australia (CAA). According to this group’s website (http://
www.circumcisionaustralia.org), the CAA ‘is not aligned with any medical body’, but is
rather a political entity seeking to expand health insurance coverage for non-medical cir-
cumcisions in Australia.4
Whether the CDC working group was aware of this context is unclear. Nevertheless, it
approvingly quotes the benefit-to-risk ratio reported by Morris et al. (2014a) in its back-
ground report, which is stated as 100:1 in favour of circumcision. However, this is a figure
that no other scientist, nor any recognised medical body to our knowledge, has ever been
able to reproduce. Instead, it overstates the relative magnitude of the benefits of circumci-
sion by a factor of approximately 100 according to the recent non-partisan analysis by the
CPS (Sorokan et al., 2015). As the CPS states, ‘the medical risk:benefit ratio of routine
newborn male circumcision is closely balanced when current research is reviewed’ (p. 4).
Given the prima facie implausibility of a 100:1 benefit-to-risk ratio in favour of circum-
cision, one might expect that the CDC working group would have sought out available
criticisms of the paper by Morris et al. (2014a) in order to incorporate alternative perspec-
tives. If so, they would have come across a critique published subsequently in the same
journal, which states that the paper is ‘marred by bias’ and that its authors ‘did not
provide a dispassionate review’ of the available evidence (Jenkins, 2014, p. 1588; but see
628
M. FRISCH AND B. D. EARP
 Morris, Bailis, & Wiswell, 2014b).5 In a similar vein, Dr Kevin Pringle, Professor of Pae-
diatrics and Head of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at the University of Otago, stated:
I find this paper to be extremely worrying. The most worrisome aspect is the emphasis on
possible diseases that are reported to be significantly more common in the uncircumcised
population and the complete lack of any attempt to accurately document the risk of the com-
plications of circumcision. (2014)
Professor Pringle went on to state:
As I read their table, the authors suggest that performing 10 circumcisions will prevent 1 case
of phimosis and/or 1 case of balanitis. [But] 80% of children with phimosis respond to the
simple application of a steroid cream and only a small percentage need a circumcision. Simi-
larly, many cases of balanitis are associated with phimosis and if the phimosis is treated, they
have no further trouble. Paediatric surgeons see most of the cases of phimosis and balanitis.
They are nowhere near as common as is suggested in this paper. (2014)
A new population-based study from Denmark, where non-therapeutic childhood circum-
cision is rare, lends support to Professor Pringle’s impression. In a stable Copenhagen
population with on average 10,858 boys born each year between 1996 and 2014, only
53 boys needed a circumcision for medical reasons before age 18 years during the calendar
year 2014. This indicates that approximately 99.5% of Danish boys will go through
infancy, childhood, and adolescence without any medical need to be circumcised
(Sneppen & Thorup, 2016).
Finally, other authors have described a separate review by Morris and a co-author as being of
‘low quality’ on account of the ‘high risk of bias … introduced by the authors’ well documented,
unconditional support of the practice of circumcision’ (Bossio, Pukall, & Steele, 2015, p. 1306;
see also Donovan, 1999). In light of these considerations, it is not readily apparent why the CDC
working group chose to rely so uncritically on the claims of Morris et al. in support of its main
conclusion. For an Australian perspective, the working group might instead have cited the offi-
cial 2010 policy of the Royal Australasian College of Physicians, which was recently re-affirmed
after an evaluation of the AAP findings from 2012 (see Pringle, 2014; see also Forbes, 2015).
This policy states: ‘the frequency of diseases modifiable by circumcision, the level of protection
offered by circumcision and the complication rates of circumcision do not warrant routine
infant circumcision in Australia and New Zealand’ (RACP, 2010, p. 5).
The value of an intact sexual organ
In a previous section, we noted that the appropriate counterbalance to the benefits of cir-
cumcision is not only the (unknown) risk of surgical complications, but rather the sum
total of negative consequences, that is, the harms. One harm of circumcision that has
been argued to be intrinsic to the procedure is the loss of healthy, functional tissue
(Hutson, 2004). Yet in its background material, the CDC does not describe the known
anatomy of the penile prepuce, nor does it discuss in detail the protective and sexual func-
tions that have been attributed to it in the medical literature (2014b). One possible con-
sequence of these omissions is that they may be taken to imply that the foreskin itself
should be assigned a value of ‘zero’ in harm–benefit calculations. Yet such a valuation
is uncommon outside of circumcising societies, and is inconsistent with normative
medical evaluations regarding other functional parts of the body (Hutson, 2004).

 The foreskin is a complex, double-layered structure, which protects the penile glans from
environmental irritation, such as rubbing against diapers and clothing (Berry & Cross, 1956;
Cold & Taylor, 1999). This elastic, motile sleeve of tissue has recently been shown to be the
most touch-sensitive part of the penis (Bossio, Pukall, & Steele, 2016; consistent with Sorrells
et al., 2007), composed of a moist mucous membrane on the inside and a protective skin layer
on the outside. It is rich in specialised nerve endings and sensory structures involved in the
normal functionality of the penis (Cold & Taylor, 1999), and it comprises up to 100 square
centimeters in adult men, with reported mean values between 30 and 50 square centimeters
(Kigozi et al., 2009; Werker, Terng, & Kon, 1998). While the scientific literature on the
‘average’ sexual consequences of circumcision is inconclusive and contradictory (Bossio,
Pukall, & Steele, 2014, 2015; Johnsdotter, 2013) – and granting that circumcision is likely
to affect different men differently, even when it is properly performed – at least two outcomes
can be known with certainty due to the inherent nature of the procedure: first, any sensation
in the foreskin itself is necessarily eliminated; and, second, any sexual (e.g. masturbatory)
functions that require its manipulation are also of necessity precluded (Earp, 2015a, 2016).
Scientific inference from African trials
In its background report (CDC, 2014b), the CDC working group, like the AAP before it
(2012b), emphasises three African trials concerning adult circumcision. These trials
reported a modest reduction in the absolute risk of heterosexual, female-to-male
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission (from 2.49% to 1.18%) during the
first few years after circumcision in high-risk areas with a low baseline circumcision preva-
lence (CDC, 2014b). A number of concerns regarding both the internal and external val-
idity of findings from these African trials have been raised (e.g. Boyle & Hill, 2011;
Garenne, Giami, & Perrey, 2013; Green et al., 2010; but see Wamai et al., 2012 and
further commentary by Bell, 2015), but even assuming that the reported efficacy estimates
of the three African trials are scientifically valid, this does not necessarily imply that their
findings are relevant elsewhere in the world.
The CDC does superficially acknowledge some of the problems associated with making
scientific inferences from studies of adult males in Africa to newborn boys in the United
States (2014b). However, the primary implication of such important caveats, namely that find-
ings from the one context cannot responsibly be extrapolated to the other without a great deal of
further investigation, is ultimately ignored. For example, the CDC background report (2014b)
highlights two analyses of the costs and health consequences of circumcision which largely
assume, based on unrepresentative observational data, that the findings from adults in Africa
will apply directly to infant boys in the United States (Kacker, Frick, Gaydos, & Tobian,
2012; Sansom et al., 2010).
The inference is stretched even further. According to the CDC, all genitally intact ado-
lescent U.S. boys and heterosexually active adult males (not only those in a few high-risk
subgroups) ‘should be informed about the significant, but partial, efficacy of male circum-
cision in reducing the risk of acquiring HIV and some STIs through heterosexual sex’
(CDC, 2014a, p. 3). Since the absolute risk of acquiring HIV for the average intact hetero-
sexual male in the United States is extremely low, however (McQuillan et al., 2006), the
recommendation that all should be counseled about the ‘significant’ benefits of circumci-
sion is arguably out of proportion (for an accessible discussion, see Bundick, 2009).

 European experience
The CDC does not consider the situation in Europe, where rates of HIV are similar to or
lower than those in the United States. In 2011, for instance, according to the Central Intel-
ligence Agency (CIA) World Factbook, the prevalence of HIV/AIDS in the age group 15–
49 years was several times higher in the United States (0.6%), where around 80% of men
are circumcised (CDC, 2014b), than in several countries of northern and western Europe
(0.1–0.3%), where circumcision is uncommon (CIA, 2011). While numerous variables
undoubtedly play into these differences, the fraction of circumcised men in a given popu-
lation is unlikely to be a determining factor.
Against this view, the CDC cites a modelling study by Kacker et al. (2012) suggesting
that if the rate of male circumcision were to drop to around 10% as in Europe, then the
United States would be destined to experience a significant increase in HIV infections
and a heavy burden of associated healthcare costs (2014b). Unfortunately, this analysis,
and another one by Sansom et al. (2010), relied on highly speculative trans-cultural and
age-range extrapolations, and both models used estimates of complication rates that are
unrealistically low (0.4% and 0%, respectively), as we will demonstrate below. Taken
together, then, the cited cost-effectiveness estimates of newborn circumcision in redu-
cing HIV in the United States (Kacker et al., 2012; Sansom et al., 2010) are overly opti-
mistic, notwithstanding the fact that one of these estimates (Sansom et al., 2010)
actually failed to show a cost-saving impact among the majority population of white
males.
Procedural and post-operative pain in infants
It is now well established that infants and small children have the full capacity to experi-
ence pain, and that early life exposure to noxious stimuli may have long-lasting impli-
cations for the developing nervous system (Fitzgerald & Beggs, 2001). Consistent with
this view, a different AAP task force that was formed to investigate infant pain (rather
than circumcision) has recently concluded that:
Pain that newborns experience from routine medical procedures can be significant …
Research suggests that repeated exposure to pain early in life can create changes in brain
development and the body’s stress response systems that can last into childhood. Because
of this, a new American Academy of Pediatrics policy statement recommends [that] every
health facility caring for newborns should use strategies to minimize the number of
painful procedures performed. (2016)
Notwithstanding the clear importance of this issue, the problem of procedural and post-
operative pain received only scant attention in the CDC’s background report (2014b).
The only cited study dealing with this question assessed pain scores among 583 boys
ages 1–35 days who received local anesthesia (ring block) before they were circumcised
(Banieghbal, 2009). Apparently, the CDC working group did not read the study care-
fully, but relied solely on the article’s abstract, which states that ‘only 6.5% of neonates
under 1 week of age’ experienced circumcisions with pain levels above a pre-defined
threshold (Banieghbal, 2009, p. 359).
The quoted figure appears nowhere apart from the abstract (Banieghbal, 2009). An esti-
mate of 6.7% is provided in a table, but that figure is miscalculated and should be 7.1%.
GLOBAL PUBLIC HEALTH
631
 While inaccurate reporting of key statistics is always regrettable, it is particularly worrying
that the CDC would rely exclusively on such a report to minimise concerns about pain in
infants.
In addition to this concern, the CDC missed entirely another key finding in the
Banieghbal study. The ring block injections administered to all the boys resulted in
above-threshold pain in fully 31% of <1 week-old boys and 85% of 1–5 week-old boys.
In other words, simply being administered the anesthesia proved painful for many
infants to a clinically significant degree. Additionally, among 1–5 week-old boys, 71%
experienced above-threshold pain during the subsequent circumcision (Banieghbal,
2009). Consequently, the CDC’s statement that ‘93.5% of neonates circumcised in the
first week of life with appropriate analgesia gave no indication of pain on an objective,
standardised neonatal pain rating system’ (2014b, p. 25) misrepresents the overall findings
from the study.
Finally, pain at the operating table is not the only pain to factor in. In one study of post-
operative discomfort in 57 neonatally circumcised boys, parental assessment revealed that
16% of the boys experienced moderate to severe post-operative discomfort, while the
remaining 84% were judged by their parents to have mild discomfort (Smith & Smith,
2000). In another study of 710 newborn boys in Michigan, 71% of parents reported
varying degrees of circumcision-related pain in their infants (ranging from “minimal”
to “much more than acceptable”) up to six weeks after the surgery (Freeman et al., 2014).
Complication rates after circumcision
In a section evaluating the safety and risks associated with circumcision (CDC,
2014b), the CDC focuses on immediate surgical risks and short-term post-operative
complications, as identified in U.S. register data. Three studies published between
16 and 40 years ago are given particular attention (Christakis et al., 2000; Gee &
Ansell, 1976; Wiswell & Geschke, 1989). However, each of these studies was designed
to address complications occurring no later than one month after neonatal circumci-
sion; indeed, two studies dealt exclusively with complications occurring just during
the post-partum hospital stay (Christakis et al., 2000; Gee & Ansell, 1976). As
pointed out by others, basing evaluations of the frequency of complications after
infant circumcision on insufficiently detailed and incomplete register data will
likely produce ‘a significant underestimation of the true frequency of complications’
(Pieretti, Goldstein, & Pieretti-Vanmarcke, 2010, p. 517). For instance, serious or even
fatal complications from post-operative bleeding or infection due to circumcision
may plausibly be recorded as hemorrhage, circulatory collapse, or septicaemia
without mention of the surgery that caused it (Dr A. Rotta, personal communication,
11 April 2016).6 Likewise, when complications are treated in other hospitals or clinics
than those responsible for the original circumcision, the general inability to cross-link
register data in countries without a unique personal identifier for every citizen (such
as the United States), may preclude the identification of such post-operative compli-
cations as being truly circumcision related (see Weiss, Larke, Halperin, & Schenker,
2010).7
In addition, a recent Canadian study by DeMaria, Abdulla, Pemberton, Raees, and
Braga (2013) found:
632
M. FRISCH AND B. D. EARP
 Most physicians performing neonatal circumcisions in our community have received infor-
mal and unstructured training. This lack of formal instruction may explain the complications
and unsatisfactory results witnessed in our pediatric urology practice. Many practitioners are
not aware of the contraindications to neonatal circumcision and most non-surgeons perform
the procedure without being able to handle common post-surgical complications. (p. 260)
Such a lack of formal training in circumcision may also prevent some doctors from recog-
nising certain complications in the first place; complications that are not recognised
cannot be reported.
Particularly worrying is the CDC’s assessment of meatal stenosis, a narrowing of the
urethral opening which is seen at far higher rates in circumcised boys compared to geni-
tally intact boys (Bazmamoun, Ghorbanpour, & Mousavi-Bahar, 2008; Berry & Cross,
1956; van Howe, 2006; Joudi, Fathi, & Hiradfar, 2011). In support of its contention that
complication rates of circumcision are trivially low, the CDC cites a study by El Bcheraoui
et al. (2014). These authors looked at hospital billing claims to evaluate the broader issue of
urethral strictures (which includes meatal stenosis) during the first 180 days after surgery.
However, a narrowing of the urethral meatus may take considerably longer than 180 days
for parents or doctors to detect (Berry & Cross, 1956; Campbell, 1943; Joudi et al., 2011;
Upadhyay, Hammodat, & Pease, 1998), which means that the chosen window of analysis
was too short. Accordingly, the observed low frequency of urethral strictures (0.01%) –
and therefore the low overall frequency of complications for boys circumcised in
infancy (0.4%) (El Bcheraoui et al., 2014) – most likely reflects a combination of insensitive
research data and insufficient follow-up.
Given such limitations affecting register-based studies, more realistic estimates of com-
plication rates should be drawn from clinical studies. However, surprisingly limited data
exist to estimate the true rate of late complications occurring months to years after non-
therapeutic circumcision. In a 2010 review of complications after newborn, infant, and
childhood circumcisions, where no clear and consistent distinction was drawn between
(1) ritual circumcision of healthy, predominantly infant boys and (2) therapeutic circum-
cision of predominantly older boys with foreskin pathology, investigators identified 52
studies from around the world, of which only one small prospective study from 1988
(n = 43; mean age at circumcision = 6.5 years) provided information about adverse out-
comes beyond the first year after the surgery (Weiss et al., 2010). Indeed, the only
adverse outcome for which a reasonable number of reports provide frequency estimates
based on direct clinical examination is meatal stenosis, which is broadly considered to
be one of the most common complications after circumcision (Bazmamoun et al., 2008;
van Howe, 2006; Joudi et al., 2011; Kajbafzadeh et al., 2011; Mondal et al., 2013; Patel,
1966; Persad, Sharma, McTavish, Imber, & Mouriquand, 1995). From such clinical
studies, it appears that between 5% and 20% of boys undergoing non-therapeutic circum-
cision by means of conventional surgical techniques will develop meatal stenosis.
In one Iranian study, which was published only as a meeting abstract, 5% of 102 neo-
nates circumcised by the PlastiBell method developed meatal stenosis during on average 9
years of follow-up; the corresponding proportion was 15% of 105 neonates circumcised by
means of classical circumcision surgery preceded by ligation of the frenular artery (Kajbaf-
zadeh et al., 2011). Similarly, a study from the United States reported a 7% prevalence of
meatal stenosis in 1009 neonatally circumcised boys older than 3 years (van Howe, 2006).
The CDC downplayed this finding (2014b), however, preferring instead a report from
GLOBAL PUBLIC HEALTH
633
 Iran, which described a frequency of only 0.9% for meatal stenosis in boys ages 6–12 years
(Yegane et al., 2006). Yet this is flawed referencing: the reported rate of meatal stenosis in
these Iranian boys was for all circumcised boys, most of whom (97.18%) were circumcised
after the neonatal period.
In several other clinical studies relying on direct penile inspection from as varied geo-
graphical areas as the United States, the United Kingdom, Bangladesh, and Iran, pro-
portions of boys developing meatal stenosis after conventional circumcision surgery in
infancy or early childhood were 7% (Bazmamoun et al., 2008), 8% (Patel, 1966; Persad
et al., 1995), 10% (Mondal et al., 2013), or 20% (Joudi et al., 2011). All of these studies
were ignored by the CDC. And yet their estimates are more consistent with the 7%
meatal stenosis rate reported in the U.S. study by van Howe (2006), which the CDC dis-
missed, than with the 700-fold lower 0.01% urethral stricture rate reported by El Bcheraoui
et al. (2014), to which the CDC paid particular attention.8
While no study is free of limitations, reported rates of 5–20% for post-circumcision
meatal stenosis in clinical studies (Bazmamoun et al., 2008; van Howe, 2006; Joudi
et al., 2011; Kajbafzadeh et al., 2011; Mondal et al., 2013; Patel, 1966; Persad et al.,
1995) call attention to the need for extra caution in interpreting reports of absolute com-
plication rates based on register data, such as that relied upon by El Bcheraoui et al. (2014).
Other studies confirm the impression that the CDC working group may have seriously
underestimated the burden of complications after newborn circumcision. For instance,
Pieretti et al. (2010) reported from a hospital department of pediatric surgery in Boston
(just one of several referral centers in the region; total number of circumcisions
unknown) that of the 8967 children (both boys and girls) operated on between 2003
and 2007, 4.7% of the operations were for late complications occurring 2–49 months
after neonatal circumcision. Another indication of the magnitude of the problem was
that, of all outpatient visits (again, of both boys and girls) to the department of pediatric
urology at the same hospital during a one-year period between 2007 and 2008, 7.4% were
for complaints related to newborn circumcision (Pieretti et al., 2010).
Summary and conclusion
In this brief analysis, we have identified numerous scientific and conceptual shortcomings
in the 2012 circumcision policy from the AAP, as well as the more recent draft guidelines
issued by the CDC. With respect to the latter, these included: (1) failure to provide a
thorough description of the normal anatomy and functions of the penile structure
being removed at circumcision (i.e. the foreskin); (2) failure to consider the intrinsic
value to some men of having an unmodified genital organ; (3) undue reliance on findings
from sub-Saharan Africa concerning circumcision of adult males (as opposed to infants or
children); (4) uncritical reliance on a prima facie implausible benefit-risk analysis per-
formed by a self-described circumcision advocate (see Davey et al., in press); (5) reliance
on misreported statistics to downplay the problem of pain in the youngest of boys; (6)
reliance on incomplete register data to assess the frequency of short-term post-operative
complications associated with circumcision, leading to a likely underestimation of their
true frequency; and (7) serious underestimation of the late-occurring harms of circumci-
sion presenting months to years after the operation (most notably meatal stenosis). In light
634
M. FRISCH AND B. D. EARP
 of these considerations, we believe that the CDC’s overall assessment of benefits versus
harms (‘risks’) of the surgery should be interpreted with extraordinary caution.
The apparent underassessment of meatal stenosis alone, possibly the most common late-
occurring complication after neonatal circumcision, means that the CDC’s claim of mark-
edly lower complication rates in boys circumcised as infants (‘less than ½ per cent’), com-
pared to boys circumcised at ages 1–9 years (‘approximately 9%’) and those circumcised at
age 10 years and older (‘approximately 5%’) (2014a, 2014b), is almost certainly inaccurate.
Indeed, with reported rates of meatal stenosis in neonatally circumcised boys in the 5–
20% range, and with estimates of clinically significant procedural pain in around 30%
(and some level of post-operative pain and discomfort in most, if not all newborn boys
undergoing the operation), the least problematic age to circumcise a boy (if at all), even
from a purely medical standpoint, may well be when he is old enough to decide for
himself. This conclusion is supported by the recent evidence showing that very few genitally
intact boys – 0.5% according to the new population-based study in Denmark (Sneppen &
Thorup, 2016) – will need a circumcision for medical reasons before the age of 18.
Notes
1. It is important to emphasise that this draft was made public, garnering much coverage in
the popular media, prior to having been subjected to a formal peer review. In a notable
turn of events, at least one medical professional who was invited by the CDC to perform
such a review subsequently made his comments available online (van Howe, 2015). This
freely accessible, 200+ page review is strongly critical of the CDC research and analysis,
as are several other expert commentaries that were posted to the CDC website in
response to a call for public feedback (e.g. Kupferschmid et al., 2015). Nevertheless, it
is currently unclear whether, or when, the CDC intends to revise its recommendations
in light of such critical feedback or else formalise them (or a modified version of
them) as official policy.
2. It is widely acknowledged that removing the foreskin of the penis may confer certain health
benefits, in much the same way that removing healthy tissue from any other part of the body
could be expected to reduce the risk of medical problems affecting – or introduced via – that
tissue (see e.g. Kluge, 1994). For example, routinely removing one testicle from every male
child would almost certainly reduce the individual boy’s risk and the population-wide inci-
dence of testicular cancer; but the costs, harms, and other disadvantages (sometimes mislead-
ingly referred to as ‘risks’, see Darby, 2015) of prophylactic testicle removal would need to be
factored into the equation, along with an array of moral considerations concerning auton-
omy, consent, and bodily integrity (not addressed in the present paper). In the case of
male circumcision, then, the question is not whether certain health benefits may in fact
ensue from the sheer surgical removal of the foreskin, but whether, in light of alternative,
less invasive, means of achieving the same desired health outcomes, the benefits are sufficient
to outweigh the costs, harms, and other disadvantages (i.e. ‘risks’), some of which may be
subjective in nature and therefore difficult to quantify (see e.g. Adams & Moyer, 2015;
Darby & Cox, 2009; Johnsdotter, 2013).
3. Moreover, as AAP task force member Freedman (2016) has additionally noted, in the United
States, at least,
although parents may use the conflicting medical literature to buttress their own beliefs
and desires, for the most part parents choose what they want for a wide variety of non-
medical reasons. There can be no doubt that religion, culture, aesthetic preference,
familial identity, and personal experience all factor into their decision. (p. 1)
GLOBAL PUBLIC HEALTH

 Consistent with this perspective, Freedman has stated in a separate interview:
I circumcised [my own son] myself on my parents’ kitchen table on the eighth day of
his life. But I did it for religious, not medical reasons. I did it because I had 3,000 years
of ancestors looking over my shoulder. (see http://www.thejewishweek.com/features/
new-york-minute/fleshing-out-change-circumcision#zpW7AFLaLTQsqJMH.99)
Granting these considerations, a further question is raised, however, regarding who should
get to decide about circumcision in light of such non-medical factors (about which there
is no universal agreement about how to weigh them): the parents, as assumed by Dr Freed-
man (including in his own case), or the individual who must undergo the surgery and there-
fore live with its consequences, positive or negative, as judged in light of his own considered
preferences and values (i.e. the child himself, when he reaches an age of competence)? As we
have just seen, even purely ‘medical’ factors may be weighed differently in the minds of differ-
ent individuals; how much more contentious might non-medical factors be?
4. It appears that such expansion of coverage would be of direct financial benefit to several CAA
board members, including the organisation’s inaugural president, Dr C. Terry Russell
(Russell Medical Center, ‘Trusted Australian Circumcision Since 1993’, http://www.
circumcision.net.au), along with board members Dr Mojtaba Athari (Melbourne Vasectomy
& Circumcision, http://www.mvandc.com.au/circumcision/), Dr Luke Bukallil (who has per-
formed ‘over 2000’ circumcisions, http://drluke.biz/Circumcision/circumcision.htm), Dr
Mohamed Hajoona (Victoria Circumcision Clinic, http://www.vcc.net.au), Dr Colin C.M.
Moore (The Australian Center for Cosmetic and Penile Surgery, http://www.drcolinmoore.
com), and Dr Anthony Dilley (who ‘conducts up to 40 circumcisions per week’, http://
www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/unkindest-cut-of-all-back-in-favour/story-e6freuzi-
1225991948585). The group’s political petition to ‘restore elective male circumcision to
public hospitals … increase the Medicare rebate [and] ensure [that] Medicare applies to pro-
phylactic circumcision not just circumcision for medical problems’ can be found here: http://
chn.ge/1otJ9Bv. A similar petition posted separately by Brian Morris is available here: https://
www.change.org/p/nsw-ministry-of-health-restore-elective-male-circumcision-to-public-
hospitals.
5. Please note that the reply to Jenkins by Morris et al. (2014b) suffers from many of the same
problems that Jenkins pointed out in his critique of their original paper. For example, most of
the references in the reply are to other contested papers by Morris and colleagues (with no
mention of published criticisms of those papers), creating what others have described as a
‘rabbit hole’ of selective self-citation (Svoboda & van Howe, 2013).
6. Alexandre T. Rotta, M.D., FCCM, is the Linsalata Family Chair in Pediatric Critical Care and
Emergency Medicine, and Chief, Division of Pediatric Critical Care, Rainbow Babies & Chil-
dren’s Hospital (University Hospitals of Cleveland); as well as Professor, Department of Pedi-
atrics, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine. Dr Rotta describes some of the
difficulties in linking circumcision-related complications with the circumcision surgery itself
due to coding issues in an interview that is available online at the following link: https://www.
youtube.com/watch?v=x_BohYj-VMw.
7. Further, indirect support for this view comes from a recent review paper by Springer (2014)
concerning complications associated with surgery for hypospadias, another penile surgery
that is often carried out in infancy or early childhood. As summarised by Carmack,
Notini, and Earp (in press), on the issue of underreporting, Springer ‘identified numerous
barriers to complete reporting of surgical, functional, cosmetic, and quality-of-life outcomes’
associated with the surgery, including
numerous techniques in use; most publications reflecting single-center and single-
surgeon retrospective case series with limited follow-up periods and small numbers
of patients undergoing follow-up; transition of care from pediatric to adult specialists,
thus limiting follow-up into the period when sexual activity is likely to occur;
636
M. FRISCH AND B. D. EARP
 assessment of cosmetic outcomes by surgeons who may be biased to approve of their
own ‘work’ … and difficulty assessing sexual function and behavior in young adults.
(p. 6)
Many of these ‘barriers to complete reporting’ of adverse outcomes are likely to apply to cir-
cumcision as well, although the matter has not been adequately studied to date. This lack of
direct and comprehensive research into the issue calls for still further caution in interpreting
available estimates of circumcision-related complications.
8. Indeed, the CDC working group mistakenly listed the El Bcheraoui et al. (2014) paper twice –
as references 158 and 164 – in its background report (CDC, 2014b), and as one of only 15
highlighted references in the shorter recommendation document (CDC, 2014a).
