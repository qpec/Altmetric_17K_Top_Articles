Abstract
Background: Survivors of intensive care are known to be at increased risk of developing longer-term
psychopathology issues. We present a large UK multicentre study assessing the anxiety, depression and post-
traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) caseness in the first year following discharge from an intensive care unit (ICU).
Methods: Design: prospective multicentre follow-up study of survivors of ICU in the UK.
Setting: patients from 26 ICUs in the UK.
Inclusion criteria: patients who had received at least 24 h of level 3 ICU care and were 16 years of age or older.
Interventions: postal follow up: Hospital Anxiety and Depression Score (HADS) and the Post-Traumatic Stress
Disorder (PTSD) Check List-Civilian (PCL-C) at 3 and 12 months following discharge from ICU.
Main outcome measure: caseness of anxiety, depression and PTSD, 2-year survival.
Results: In total, 21,633 patients admitted to ICU were included in the study. Postal questionnaires were sent to
13,155 survivors; of these 38% (4943/13155) responded and 55% (2731/4943) of respondents passed thresholds for
one or more condition at 3 or 12 months following discharge. Caseness prevalence was 46%, 40% and 22% for
anxiety, depression and PTSD respectively; 18% (870/4943 patients) met the caseness threshold for all three
psychological conditions. Patients with symptoms of depression were 47% more likely to die during the first 2 years
after discharge from ICU than those without (HR 1.47, CI 1.19–1.80).
Conclusions: Over half of those who respond to postal questionnaire following treatment on ICU in the UK reported
significant symptoms of anxiety, depression or PTSD. When symptoms of one psychological disorder are present, there is
a 65% chance they will co-occur with symptoms of one of the other two disorders. Depression following critical illness is
associated with an increased mortality risk in the first 2 years following discharge from ICU.

 Background
Survivors of critical illness are at risk of experiencing
significant physical, cognitive and psychological issues
after discharge [1]. New or worsening impairment in
physical, cognitive or mental health status following
treatment on an intensive care unit (ICU) is known as
post-intensive care syndrome (PICS) [2]. The psycho-
pathological components of PICS are estimated to occur
in up to a third of survivors of ICU treatment [1]. The
major psychological conditions described are anxiety, de-
pression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
Symptoms of anxiety following critical illness occur in
25–46% of patients in the 3–14 months following dis-
charge from an ICU [3]. Post ICU anxiety is associated
with psychiatric symptoms, memories and delusions [4–
6]. Unlike the general population, where anxiety is more
common in women aged 30–44 years [7], no association
with age, sex, disease severity or length of stay has been
found in patients treated on an ICU. This difference
may reflect a causal association or the underpowered na-
ture of the individual studies (where the largest previous
study included 255 patients [8]).
Depressive symptoms occur in around 29% of survi-
vors at 3, 6 and 12 months post ICU discharge [3]. De-
pressive illness following intensive care is associated
with symptoms of psychological distress (anxiety, stress
and anger). The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale
(HADS) is the most commonly used (and validated) tool;
however, the most recent meta-analysis identified only
387 unique patients with HADS data at 3 and 6 months
post discharge and a further 412 at 6 and 12 months [9].
Like anxiety, there was no association with age or sex, in
contrast to findings in general populations [9]. In
addition, there was no correlation with ICU length of
stay or illness severity.
A recent meta-analysis (2015) estimated PTSD symp-
tom prevalence at 17–34% at 12 months post-ICU dis-
charge [3]. Risk factors for the development of post-ICU
PTSD include the presence of pre-ICU anxiety and
depression.
The risk of mortality in survivors of critical illness is 3.4
times greater than that of the general population over the
5 years following discharge [10]. Mortality remains greater
than that of the general population for up to 4 years fol-
lowing ICU admission. There is a known association be-
tween depression and an increased risk of death, both in
the general population [11, 12] and specific subgroups of
patients with illness-comorbid depression. Conversely,
anxiety and/or PTSD have been associated with a de-
creased mortality hazard [11]. Whether the presence of
psychopathology affects mortality following treatment on
an ICU overall is unknown.
Previous studies of psychopathology after critical ill-
ness are limited by their size. In many cases they are
performed in specific sub-populations, conditions or as
part of a randomised controlled trial (RCT) [3, 9, 13].
Survivors of critical illness are heterogeneous in terms
of illness severity, treatment and long-term prognosis.
Few studies have concurrently assessed symptoms of
anxiety, depression and PTSD in a general adult ICU
population. ICU-specific conditions such as acute re-
spiratory depression syndrome (ARDS) are associated
with poorer longer-term outcome and a high incidence
of psychopathology [13]. However, these diagnoses rep-
resent the minority of overall ICU admissions.
Objective
We postulated that illness-comorbid depression is inde-
pendently associated with survival, when other known
associations such as age and illness severity are consid-
ered. We undertook a large multicentre postal survey of
all patients admitted to participating UK general adult
ICUs. Our objective was to describe the pattern of psy-
chopathology occurring in survivors at 3 and 12 months
following discharge from ICU and to assess any associ-
ation with mortality.
Methods
This study is reported following the Strengthening of
Reporting in Observational studies in Epidemiology
(STROBE) guidance [14].
Study design
The Intensive Care Outcomes Network study (ICON)
was a UK multicentre prospective cohort study asses-
sing heath related quality of life (HRQoL) and caseness
of anxiety, depression and PTSD, by postal question-
naire, following at least 24 h treatment on an ICU.
Caseness is the degree to which the accepted standar-
dised diagnostic criteria for a given condition are ap-
plicable to a given patient. A questionnaire study
assesses the self-reported symptom burden consistent
with a specific disorder but cannot be considered diag-
nostic.
The
trial
was
registered
ISRCTN69112866
(assigned 2 May 2006) and the study protocol has been
published [15]. This study was conducted in three con-
secutive phases (summarised in Additional file 1). Eth-
ical approval for phases 1 and 2 was granted by
Oxfordshire Research Ethics Committee B (REC 06/
Q1605/17). Ethical approval for phase 3 was granted by
National Research Ethics Service – South Central Berk-
shire (REC 11/SC/0172). The ICON study had Section
60 of the Health and Social Care Act 2001 (subse-
quently Section 251 of the National Health Service
(NHS) Act 2006) approval (PIAG 2–05(e)/2006). This
granted permission to record details of all admissions
meeting the inclusion criteria at participating ICUs.

 Setting
Phases 1 and 2 took place in the same 26 UK ICUs (1
university hospital, 6 university-affiliated hospitals and
19 district general hospitals) and postal questionnaires
were sent at 3, 12 and 24 months following discharge
form ICU. Phase 1 recruited from November 2006 to
May 2008 and recruited 9582 patients. Phase 2 recruited
from May 2008 to October 2010 and recruited 18,490
patients as part of an RCT to study the effect of different
questionnaire burden on response rate, the results of
which have been published [16].
Phase 3 took place between May 2012 and May 2013 in
31 UK ICUs (10 university hospital, 3 university-affiliated
hospitals and 18 district general hospitals), and of these 18
recruiting centres are common with phases 1 and 2. Phase 3
recruited 2876 patients, with postal questionnaires adminis-
tered at 3 and 12 months post ICU discharge. Questionnaire
burden was identical to phase 1. Where possible patients
were approached by a research nurse prior to their discharge
from hospital. Patients were followed up by telephone if they
later failed to respond to a postal questionnaire.
Participants
We extracted data from all three phases of the ICON
study database, with the exception of group A from the
second phase, as this group did not receive psychological
instruments by design [15, 16]. Each phase had identical
inclusion and exclusion criteria.
Eligible patients received level 3 care on an ICU (as de-
fined by the Intensive Care Society, London [17]), for at least
24 h and were 16 years or older at ICU admission. We ex-
cluded patients not registered with a general practitioner or
of no fixed abode (factors anticipated to prevent follow up in
the study). We also excluded patients taking part in another
questionnaire follow-up study run by the same research of-
fice and in phase 3, those patients who withdrew consent
prior to discharge from hospital (as we could not legitimately
track their mortality even to hospital discharge). In addition,
we excluded those patients who could not be matched to
the Intensive Care National Audit & Research Centre
(ICNARC) Case Mix Programme database and patients who
were not captured by the ICON study during their incident
admission to ICU during their hospital stay (as we were tim-
ing questionnaire response from their first exposure to ICU).
Patients could withdraw their consent at any point during
any phase of the study (by contacting the study office or by
returning the survey blank). This resulted in their personal
identifying data being purged from the study database, anon-
ymising their record at that point. We did not contact pa-
tients following a specific request by their GP.
Variables
Patients received a letter introducing the study at ICU dis-
charge. The letter explained that they might receive mail
from the study team and provided contact details for the
study office. Eligible patients received postal question-
naires at 3 and 12 months following discharge from ICU.
Each mailing included the HADS (14 questions, 7 depres-
sion and 7 anxiety, each scored ordinally 0–3), the Post
Traumatic Stress Disorder Check List – Civilian version
(PCL-C – 17 questions score ordinally 1–5) and other
health related quality of life instruments (see Additional
file 1). When there was no response to the first mailing,
this was followed by a second postal copy 14 days later. In
phases 1 and 2 no response after the second mailing was
considered a loss to follow up. In phase 3, an additional at-
tempt was made to call the patient.
A cut-off score ≥ 8 for either HADS anxiety or depres-
sion scales defined caseness of the respective condition
[18]. We applied HADS boundaries for mild, moderate
and severe symptoms to those exhibiting caseness [19].
A PCL-C score ≥ 45 defined PTSD caseness [20].
Data sources and measurement
We linked participant records with the ICNARC Case
Mix Programme [21] to obtain admitting diagnoses, se-
verity of illness scores and to capture previous admis-
sions to ICU during their hospital stay. We checked
survival and current registered address with the patient’s
registered general practitioner (GP) and the National
Health Service Summary Care Record [22] before post-
ing each questionnaire pack.
With the exception of those who withdrew consent,
we linked participants to the Medical Research Informa-
tion Service (MRIS) run by NHS Digital. This provided
linked mortality data and event notification from the Of-
fice of National Statistics (ONS).
Bias
In phase 1 and 2, clinical staff gave participants a letter
explaining that they would receive ICON documentation
in the post at the point of discharge from the ICU. In
phase 3 a study nurse aimed to visit the patients be-
tween ICU and hospital discharge to introduce the
ICON study, where a study nurse was available. Further
information was provided and a second visit could be ar-
ranged to provide written consent if so wished. Patients
could remove their consent at any time.
Study size
Study size was based on the total number of patients
meeting inclusion criteria and admitted to the participat-
ing units inside the recruitment period.
Quantitative variables
For this analysis the primary outcome was the propor-
tion of patients meeting predefined thresholds for case-
ness of anxiety and depression (using the HADS scale)
Hatch et al. Critical Care          (2018) 22:310 
Page 3 of 13
 and for PTSD (using PCL-C) at 3 and 12 months follow-
ing discharge from ICU. Secondary outcome measures
were survival at 3, 12 and 24 months following discharge
from ICU, the proportion of individual patients transi-
tioning these thresholds between time points and the
correlation between PTSD, anxiety and depression.
Statistical methods
Statistical
analysis
was
undertaken
using
R
Core
v3.4.1 [23]. We did not correct for multiple testing.
Response was defined as return of a questionnaire
with
valid
written
consent.
Each
instrument
was
scored in accordance with the author’s instructions.
Individual responses not meeting these instructions
were considered invalid and excluded from further
analysis. The proportions of patients meeting the cri-
teria for caseness were calculated for each instrument
at each time point. Those meeting the HADS thresh-
olds were further subdivided by symptom severity
(mild, moderate, severe).
Population demographics, responses to the individual
psychological instruments and change analysis were pre-
sented in keeping with the pre-specified data collection
plan for the ICON Study. Survival analysis was first per-
formed using the Kaplan-Meier (KM) method. Patients
were right censored when we could no longer track their
mortality (lost to follow up). This occurred when pa-
tients explicitly withdrew their consent (excluding them
from being enrolled with MRIS/ONS). Study phases and
participants with and without caseness were compared
using the log-rank test with p < 0.01.
We performed ad-hoc Cox proportional hazards mod-
elling to study the effects of depression, anxiety and
PTSD caseness on survival, adjusting for known con-
founders. We verified the assumption of proportional
hazards prior to conducting the analysis. The study de-
sign meant that censoring of individual subjects did not
occur as a result of the disease process. We identified
age (as a continuous variable), sex (as a binary variable)
and severity of illness Acute Physiology and Chronic
Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score as a continuous
variable [24]) as potential confounders from the litera-
ture [3, 13, 25]. The interpretation of a continuous vari-
able is that for each additional unit increase in the
continuous variable the hazard ratio increases by the
value reported. The interpretation of a binary variable is
the hazard ratio associated with male versus female (sex)
or caseness versus no caseness for the other variables.
The effect of these variables on survival was confirmed
using univariable Cox proportional hazard analysis. Four
multivariable models were then constructed. All in-
cluded the
co-founders identified in the literature.
Models 1–3 included each psychological disorder in iso-
lation and model 4 included all three.
Results
Participants
We screened 21,633 patients for eligibility across the three
phases of the study in November 2006 to May 2013:
19,822 patients satisfied the eligibility requirements. Of
these, 3289 (17%) died during their admission to ICU. Fol-
lowing discharge alive from ICU, 2710 (2710/19,822
(14%)) of those eligible died in the subsequent 75 days.
There were 429 patients (429/13,823 (3%)) excluded from
follow up by request of their general practitioner (GP) (see
the patient flow diagram in Additional file 2).
Of those who were alive at the point of being sent a
questionnaire at 3 or 12 months, 4943 patients (4943/
13,155 (38%)) completed at least one survey. Of those
mailed at 3 months 4809 (4809/12,777 (38%)) completed
a survey. Of those mailed at 12 months, 3569 (3569/
4936 (72%)) completed a survey (non-respondents and
those who actively declined to consent at 3 months were
not mailed). In total 2943 patients (22,943/13,155 (22%))
actively declined to consent (by returning a blank form
or contacting the research office at 3 or 12 months).
Descriptive data
Table 1 shows the demographics, illness severity and
organ support for those eligible to receive a postal sur-
vey and those responding at either 3 or 12 months. The
two groups were remarkably balanced in terms of their
baseline
demographics/measured
confounders.
Add-
itional file 3 includes identical demographics with col-
umns for those not responding to the study, explicitly
removing consent and responding with and without
symptoms of psychopathological issues.
Outcome data
Figure 1 shows the distribution of HADS anxiety, HADS
depression and PCL-C in patients that provided valid re-
sponses at both 3 and 12 months. Percentages denote
those with and without caseness. At 3 months the case-
ness prevalence for anxiety, depression and PTSD were
45.7%, 41.0% and 22.0% respectively. An identical ana-
lysis including all those responding at either time point
is available in Additional file 4. Responses to individual
questions are found in Additional files 5 and 6.
Whilst population prevalence is largely unchanged be-
tween 3 and 12 months across all three instruments,
10% of responders met the threshold for significant
symptoms consistent with anxiety or depression at
12 months, who had not fulfilled these criteria when
they responded at 3 months (Additional file 7). Similarly,
7% of responders met the symptom threshold for PTSD
by 12 months, who had not when responding at
3 months. Therefore, between one third and one half of
the patients meeting the threshold for caseness do so at
only one of the two time points.

 Change analysis was performed for each instrument, in-
cluding only those patients who reached the caseness thresh-
old at one but not both time points (Fig. 2). The magnitude
of this change was significant in the majority of cases: 76%
and 81% of patients changed their anxiety/depression score
by more than 3 points (3/22 patients (14% change)). A fur-
ther 84% of patients experienced a change of 7 of more
points (7/69 patients (10% change)) in their PCL-C score.
Concurrent psychopathology
Figure 3 shows the concurrent caseness of anxiety,
depression and PTSD in individual patients. Of re-
spondents, 55.2% (2731/4943) met caseness thresholds
for at least one of the three conditions at either 3 or
12 months: 35.8% (1770/4943) met caseness thresh-
olds
for
more
than
one
psychopathological
issue.
Meeting caseness thresholds for PTSD alone was the
least common (36 participants, 0.7% of those report-
ing psychopathological issues).
Survival
Figure 4 shows the 24-month survival of patients who
responded at 3 or 12 months, dichotomised by those
who had reported caseness for depression at either time
point and those that had not. Survival data to 24 months
were available for patients in phase 1 and 2 of the study,
whilst phase 3 mortality data ended at 12 months (Add-
itional file 8). Patients with a HADS-D ≥ 8 experienced a

 higher likelihood of death in the first 2 years after dis-
charge from ICU (p < 0.001). Kaplan-Meier (KM) curves
for anxiety and PTSD caseness are presented in Add-
itional files 9 and 10 and do not demonstrate a signifi-

for all other variables in the model. Figure 5 is a
graphical representation of the hazard ratios and con-
fidence intervals from the final multivariable model

 (Additional file 11, model 4). This model takes the
fact that some patients may demonstrate symptoms
for one or more of anxiety, depression or PTSD into
account (as seen in Fig. 3). Adjusted for age, sex, ill-
ness severity and the presence of other psychopatho-
logical issues, those meeting caseness thresholds for
depression were around 50% more likely to die in the
2 years following discharge than those not meeting
caseness (hazard ratio 1.47, 95% CI 1.19–1.80).
Discussion
Key results
We present the largest multicentre postal survey of
self-reported anxiety, depression and PTSD of ICU
survivors to date. A high burden of post-ICU psycho-
pathological issues was reported with over half of re-
spondents meeting caseness thresholds for anxiety,
depression or PTSD. A high degree of symptom concur-
rency between these three conditions was observed.

 Especially interesting is the relatively low incidence of
isolated PTSD, occurring in fewer than 1 in 20 individ-
uals reporting any form of suspected psychopathological
issue. Conversely, symptoms of anxiety occurred in 83%
of individuals reporting any psychopathological issue. A
strong association between self-reported symptoms of
depression and mortality has been demonstrated in ICU
survivors. When other known associations are adjusted
for (age, male sex, illness severity), patients with depres-
sive symptoms are nearly 50 % more likely to die during
the first 24 months after leaving ICU than those without
depression caseness.
Interpretation and generalisability
Our study has shown that symptoms of anxiety, depres-
sion or PTSD occur in half of patients who respond to a
postal questionnaire after treatment on a UK ICU, with
nearly a third displaying symptoms of two or more con-
ditions at 3 or 12 months following ICU discharge in the
UK. This is comparable with incidence of persistent psy-
chopathological issues in longer-term follow-up studies
of survivors of ARDS where both the overall incidence
of anxiety, depression and PTSD and co-occurrence of
psychopathological issues are similar [26]. It is note-
worthy that this pattern and prevalence of psychopatho-
logical issues extends across a UK general adult ICU
population. Clinicians involved in the follow up and as-
sessment of all survivors of ICU should be aware of the
co-occurrence of psychopathological conditions as part
of PICS. In this cohort, PTSD rarely occurs in isolation,
instead strongly co-occurring with anxiety. Pre-existing
anxiety has been demonstrated as a risk factor for devel-
oping PTSD in urban populations [27]; on meta-analysis
a pre-existing psychopathological condition was the only
pre-ICU factor that was consistently associated with
PTSD symptoms. Conversely, PTSD symptomatology is
strongly correlated with both post-ICU anxiety [3] and
co-morbid depression post critical illness [28]. It seems
logical that anxiety can lead to PTSD. However, these
data lack any detail on pre-existing psychological status.
Our study discovered a previously unknown association
between symptoms of depression and increased mortality

 for 2 years following ICU discharge. The association per-
sists when adjusted for age, illness severity, sex and the
presence of other psychopathological issues. Although de-
pressive symptomatology is associated with increased
mortality in other populations, it is with less magnitude
than the 47% increased risk we have demonstrated follow-
ing ICU discharge. For comparison, a large US study in a
general veterans’ population estimates that diagnosed de-
pression is associated with 17% greater hazard of all-cause
mortality at 3 years [11]. This study also demonstrates that
depression is associated with higher mortality rates for
common medical conditions such as heart disease, re-
spiratory illness, cerebrovascular disease, accidents, dia-
betes mellitus and hypertension. It remains unclear
whether clinicians are overlooking the screening and treat-
ment of depression in favour of treating chronic medical
conditions or whether there is a biological association be-
tween chronic illness and depression. In the post-ICU
population, the observed association between depression
and mortality could be in part explained by the severity of
chronic illness both pre-discharge and post-discharge -
factors we did not adjust for in this study.
However, to the best of our knowledge, an associ-
ation between depression and an increased rate of
mortality after discharge from ICU has not been dem-
onstrated previously. Depression could be a factor not
previously considered in post-ICU survival. Given the
incidence of depression amongst survivors, symptoms
of this condition should be detected and managed
during the time following ICU in primary care and in
ICU follow-up clinics.
Limitations
The main limitation of our postal survey is the rela-
tively low response rate that potentially limits the ap-
plicability of these results. It is not possible using
these data to infer the reason for non-response and
as a consequence there is a potential selection/infor-
mation bias in the results This postal survey followed
best practice guidance and an RCT performed as part
of this study demonstrated that a reduced question-
naire burden did not improve the response rate [16].
Failure of the postal network to return questionnaires
is highly unlikely, however we cannot exclude the
possibility that patients discharged from hospital may
not initially return to their permanent address, limit-
ing the delivery of questionnaires to recipients [29].
However, it is unlikely to be the universal reason. A
significant proportion (22%) received a postal ques-
tionnaire and were able to contact the study in order
to explicitly decline consent. There is clearly a signifi-
cant group of people that are physically and mentally
capable of returning a questionnaire but explicitly do
not wish to take part in this form of research.
We suggest that the limited response rate is pre-
dominantly a methodological limitation of undertak-
ing a postal survey in a post critical illness population
in the UK. KM survival analysis of the 3–24-month
period post ICU discharge included those meeting the
caseness threshold at 3 or 12 months. There is the
potential that including the 12-month respondents
added bias. Reporting depression at 12 months would
exclude those who had died in the preceding period
and
bias
towards
fewer
deaths
in
those
with
depression.
A postal survey can only be used to calculate the
prevalence of disease caseness rather than true clinical
diagnostic rates. The validity of our findings is therefore
reliant on the psychometric properties of the instru-
ments used. The instruments employed here have been
validated in similar cohorts. HADS [30] has been found
to perform well in assessing the symptom severity and
caseness of anxiety disorders and depression in patients
with somatic symptoms and patients in psychiatric or
primary care as well as in the general population [18,
31]. The psychometric properties of HADS have been
evaluated in survivors of acute lung injury and its use
has been suggested as part of a core-outcomes set for
future clinical trials [32, 33]. Interpretation is based pri-
marily on the cut-off scores. The authors of HADS sug-
gested
a
4-tier
system
(normal
<= 7,
mild
8–10,
moderate 11–14 and severe 15–21) [19]. Subsequent
studies have suggested a score of ≥ 8 provides sensitiv-
ity and specificity of 0.80 for both HADS anxiety and
depression [34] although, certain conditions are known
to affect the sensitivity and specificity e.g. traumatic
brain injury [35].
This study had limited access to pre-morbid conditions,
specifically pre-existing psychological and psychiatric con-
ditions. Patients with pre-existing psychopathological con-
ditions are at higher risk of
both developing new
symptoms and worsening existing problems following
treatment in the ICU. In addition, it is possible that a
phenotype exists where pre-morbid sufferers of anxiety/
depression/PTSD are at a higher risk of developing critical
illness. Future studies should collect pre-morbid psycho-
logical history in order to explore this hypothesis further.
The existing literature reports on the use of a variety
of PTSD instruments, with the most popular being the
Impact Event Scale (IES) [25]. Our study chose PCL-C
above IES as the latter lacks sufficient sensitivity and
specificity in the ICU population [36, 37]. Correlation
of 0.93 between the total PCL-C score and structured
interview with the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale
(CAPS) has been demonstrated (diagnostic efficiency
0.9) [38]. A score of 45 or greater on the PCL-C has
been recommended as a cut-off for high PTSD symp-
tom load, with sensitivity of 0.60 and specificity of 0.99

 for diagnosing PTSD when compared with a structured
clinical interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual of Mental Health Disorders (DSM-IV) in survi-
vors of breast cancer [20].
This study reports results from 3 different phases of
the ICON study. There were small differences in the
methodologies between studies (for a summary see Add-
itional file 1). However, recruitment criteria and the in-
struments used to assess the psychopathological issues
were identical, minimising the risks of including all 3
phases in this analysis.
Future considerations
Following these results, future work should focus on
describing the population that fails to respond to
postal questionnaire. This should include determin-
ing whether study participants are in long-term care
facilities, home care or otherwise incapacitated, as
well as exploring some of the reasons why those
who are physically and mentally able to respond
choose not to. In addition, the utility of the postal
questionnaire in detecting undiagnosed psychopatho-
logical issues should be evaluated and the treatments
that
result
from
detection
described.
This
study
strongly emphasises that future work should evaluate
all forms of psychopathological conditions simultan-
eously, rather than focusing on a single specific con-
dition. Collecting data on pre-morbid psychological
and medical co-morbidities would also be essential
in terms of understanding the risk factors for devel-
oping PICS, as current illness severity scoring and
organ
support
information
is
clearly
insufficient
when it comes to understanding which individuals
are at greatest risk.
Conclusions
Half of those who respond to postal questionnaire
following treatment on ICU in the UK report signifi-
cant symptoms of anxiety, depression or PTSD at 3
and 12 months after discharge. When symptoms of
one psychological condition are present, there is a
64% chance they will co-occur with symptoms of an-
other. Survivors of critical illness who report symp-
toms of depression have an increased risk of dying
in the 2 years following discharge from ICU.
