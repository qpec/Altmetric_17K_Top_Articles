Prevalence of Asthma, Asthma Attacks,  
and Emergency Department Visits for Asthma Among Working Adults —  
National Health Interview Survey, 2011–2016
Jacek M. Mazurek, MD, PhD1; Girija Syamlal, MBBS1
In 2010, an estimated 8.2% of U.S. adults had current asthma, 
and among these persons, 49.1% had had an asthma attack dur-
ing the past year (1). Workplace exposures can cause asthma in 
a previously healthy worker or can trigger asthma exacerbations 
in workers with current asthma* (2). To assess the industry- and 
occupation-specific prevalence of current asthma, asthma attacks, 
and asthma-related emergency department (ED) visits among 
working adults, CDC analyzed 2011–2016 National Health 
Interview Survey (NHIS) data for participants aged ≥18 years who, 
at the time of the survey, were employed at some time during the 
12 months preceding the interview. During 2011–2016, 6.8% of 
adults (11 million) employed at any time in the past 12 months 
had current asthma; among those, 44.7% experienced an asthma 
attack, and 9.9% had an asthma-related ED visit in the previous 
year. Current asthma prevalence was highest among workers in 
the health care and social assistance industry (8.8%) and in health 
care support occupations (8.8%). The increased prevalence of 
current asthma, asthma attacks, and asthma-related ED visits in 
certain industries and occupations might indicate increased risks 
for these health outcomes associated with workplace exposures. 
These findings might assist health care and public health profes-
sionals in identifying workers in industries and occupations with 
a high prevalence of current asthma, asthma attacks, and asthma-
related ED visits who should be evaluated for possible work-related 
asthma. Guidelines intended to promote effective management 
of work-related asthma are available (2,3). 
The NHIS is an annual survey that collects health information 
from a nationally representative sample of the noninstitutionalized 
U.S. civilian population through personal interviews.† Survey 
* Work-related asthma is defined as either occupational asthma (i.e., new-onset 
asthma caused by factors related to work) or work-exacerbated asthma (i.e., 
preexisting or concurrent asthma worsened by factors related to work).

participants were considered to be working in the last 12 months 
if they reported having a job or business at any time during the 
past 12 months.§ For analyses, information on respondents’ 
current industry (21 major groups/79 detailed industries) and 
occupation (23 major groups/94 detailed occupations) were used.¶ 
Participants who had ever been told by a doctor or other health 
professional that they had asthma and reported that they still have 
asthma were considered to have current asthma. Persons with at

least one asthma attack in the past year, or at least one asthma-
related ED visit in the past year were identified by affirmative 
responses to questions “During the past 12 months, have you had 
an episode of asthma or an asthma attack?” and “During the past 
12 months, have you had to visit an emergency room or urgent 
care center because of asthma?,” respectively.
Data were weighted to produce nationally representative esti-
mates using sample weights, and variance estimates were calculated 
to account for the clustered survey design. Estimates with a rela-
tive standard error (standard error of the estimate divided by the 
estimate) ≥30% were not reported. The Rao-Scott chi-square test 
was used to determine statistically significant differences (p<0.05) 
between groups. Data were analyzed using statistical software.
During 2011–2016, an estimated (annual average) 
160.7 million adults were working at any time during the past 
12 months (Table 1), 6.8% (11.0 million) of whom had current 
asthma. Current asthma prevalence was highest among workers 
aged 18–24 years (8.5%), females (8.9%), non-Hispanic blacks 
(8.2%), those with higher than a high school education (7.2%), 
those categorized as “poor”** (8.7%), those having health 
insurance (7.1%), and those living in the Northeast (7.6%).
 
** Poverty index is based on family income and family size using the U.S. Census 
Bureau’s poverty thresholds for the previous calendar year. Persons categorized 
as “poor” have family incomes <100% of the poverty threshold, “near poor” 
have family incomes ≥100% to <200% of the poverty threshold, “not poor” 
have family incomes ≥200% of the poverty threshold.  ftp://ftp.cdc.gov/pub/
Health_Statistics/NCHS/Dataset_Documentation/NHIS/2016/srvydesc.pdf, 
https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/income-poverty/
historical-poverty-thresholds.html.
Among workers with current asthma, 44.7% (4.9 million) had 
at least one asthma attack, and 9.9% (1.1 million) had at least 
one asthma-related ED visit in the past 12 months (Table 1). 
The proportion of workers with current asthma who had at least 
one asthma attack was highest among workers aged 45–64 years 
(47.4%), females (48.4%), non-Hispanic whites (45.4%), 
those with higher than a high school education (45.2%), those 
categorized as poor (49.2%), those with no health insurance 
(47.5%), and those living in the South (46.1%). The proportion 
of workers with current asthma who had at least one asthma-
related ED visit was highest among workers aged 18–24 years 
(10.5%), females (11.7%), non-Hispanic blacks (17.6%), those 
with less than high school education (13.3%), those categorized 
as poor (17.0%), those with no health insurance (14.5%), and 
those living in the South (11.3%).
By major industry, current asthma prevalence was highest 
among workers in the major industry groups of health care and 
social assistance (8.8%) followed by educational services (8.2%) 
(Table 2); these groups also had the first and second highest 
numbers of workers with asthma attacks (860,000 and 602,000, 
respectively) and asthma-related ED visits (212,000 and 102,000, 
respectively). The highest prevalence of asthma attacks was among 
workers with asthma in the transportation and warehousing 
(51.7%) industries, and the highest prevalence of asthma-related 
ED visits was among workers in retail trade (12.4%).
By detailed industry sector, current asthma prevalence was 
highest among workers in electronics and appliance stores 
(11.9%) (Table 2). Among persons with current asthma, the

highest asthma attack prevalence was among workers in wood 
products manufacturing (57.3%), followed by the plastics 
and rubber products manufacturing (56.7%), and the highest 
prevalence of asthma-related ED visits was among workers in 
private households (22.9%). The highest numbers of asthma 
attacks (307,000) and asthma-related ED visits (75,000) were 
among persons working in ambulatory health care services.
By major occupation group, current asthma prevalence was 
highest among workers in health care support (8.8%), followed 
by personal care and service (8.6%) occupations (Table 3). 
Among those with current asthma, the highest prevalence of 
asthma attacks was among workers in the education, training, 
and library (51.5%) major occupations; the highest prevalence 
of asthma-related ED visits was among workers in personal 
care and service (17.4%) occupations. The highest numbers 
of workers with asthma attacks (711,000) and asthma-related 
ED visits (137,000) were in the office and administrative sup-
port major occupation.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
In 2010, an estimated 8.2% of U.S. adults had current asthma; 
among them, 49.1% reported at least one asthma attack in the 
past year. Up to 51% of adult asthma might be related to work 
and could therefore potentially be prevented.
What is added by this report?
During 2011–2016, among an estimated 160.7 million working 
adults, 6.8% had current asthma. Among those with asthma, 
44.7% experienced an asthma attack, and 9.9% had an asthma-
related emergency department visit in the previous year. The 
current asthma prevalence was highest among workers 
employed in the health care and social assistance industry 
(8.8%) and in health care support occupations (8.8%). 
What are the implications for public health practice?
This information might assist physicians to identify workers who 
should be evaluated for possible work-related asthma and 
could help public health officials identify workplaces where 
detailed investigations for prevention and control might be 
appropriate. Guidelines promoting effective management of 
work-related asthma are available.  
Discussion
This report provides industry- and occupation-specific 
prevalence estimates of current asthma, and among those 
with current asthma, the prevalence of at least one asthma 
attack and at least one asthma-related ED visit in the past 
year. The numbers of workers reporting asthma attacks and 
asthma-related ED visits in specific industries and occupations 
correlate with the numbers of workers and current asthma 
prevalence in each group. The increased prevalence of current 
asthma, asthma attacks, and asthma-related ED visits in certain 
industries and occupations might indicate increased risks for 
these health outcomes associated with workplace exposures. 
The highest prevalence of current asthma was among workers 
in the health care and social assistance industry and in health 
care support occupations. New-onset work-related asthma in 
these workers has been associated with exposure to cleaning and 
disinfecting products, powdered latex gloves, and aerosolized 
medications (4). Nearly two thirds of the workers with asthma 
in the wood products and in the plastics and rubber products 
manufacturing industries had at least one asthma attack in the 
past year. Workers in these industries are at increased risk for 
work-related asthma (5,6), and the high proportion of work-
ers with a history of an asthma attack in this report suggests a 
high risk for work-related exacerbation of asthma. Education, 
training, and library workers are also at risk for work-related 
asthma and adverse health outcomes (7).
NHIS did not collect data on severity of asthma exacerba-
tions and asthma work-relatedness. The subset of patients who 
experience severe asthma exacerbations have an accelerated 
decline in lung function, greater health care utilization, and a 
lower quality of life (3,8). Based on the estimate that approxi-
mately 51% of adult asthma might be caused or made worse 
by work (9), as many as 5.6 million workers might have asthma 
or asthma outcomes related to work that could be prevented. 
Physicians should consider work-related asthma in all workers 
with new-onset or worsening asthma (2,3).
Workplace conditions and exposures associated with 
asthma include irritant chemicals, dusts, secondhand tobacco 
smoke, allergens and sensitizers, emotional stress, worksite 
temperature, and physical exertion (3). A list of asthma-
gens causing work-related asthma by sensitization or acute 
irritant-induced asthma is available (http://www.aoecdata.org/
ExpCodeLookup.aspx). Identification of potential asthma-
related agents in the workplace can be facilitated by obtaining 
safety data sheets.*** Guidelines intended to promote effective 
management of work-related asthma are available (2,3). The 
preferred primary strategy to prevent work-related asthma and 
reduce signs, symptoms, and progression of disease is exposure 
control (i.e., elimination or substitution of hazardous products, 
engineering controls, and respiratory protection). However, if 
these approaches are unsuccessful, removal of the worker from 
exposure might sometimes be necessary for management of 
work-related asthma (2,3,10).
The findings in this report are subject to at least four 
limitations. First, information on asthma, asthma attacks, and 
asthma-related ED visits was self-reported and not validated 
by medical records. It is likely that some respondents had 
misdiagnosed or undiagnosed asthma. Second, no temporal 
information on asthma onset and exacerbations was available; 
thus, it was not possible to determine asthma association 
with work. Third, only workers employed at some time in 
the past 12 months were included in this study. Those with 
severe asthma might have left employment in industries and 
occupations with workplace exposures that exacerbate their 
asthma; thus, industry and occupation in this report might 
not accurately identify workers’ industry and occupation where 
exposures occur. Finally, small sample sizes for some groups 
resulted in unreliable estimates.
These findings might assist physicians to identify workers 
who should be evaluated for possible work-related asthma in 
industries and occupations with a high prevalence of asthma, 
asthma attacks, and asthma-related ED visits and could help 
public health officials identify workplaces where detailed 
investigations for prevention and control might be appropriate. 
Continued surveillance is important to assess asthma preva-
lence and trends by respondents’ industry and occupation.
