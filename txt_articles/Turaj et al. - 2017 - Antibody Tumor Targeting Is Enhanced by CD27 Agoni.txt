In Brief
Turaj et al. test anti-tumor efficacy of
immunomodulatory antibodies combined
with anti-CD20 and find that anti-CD27/
CD20 has a strong benefit in several
tumor models. Anti-CD27 induces IFNg
and chemokines in CD8+ T and NK cells,
enhancing macrophage infiltration and
activation to promote anti-CD20 activity.

SUMMARY
Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) can destroy tumors by recruiting effectors such as myeloid cells, or targeting
immunomodulatory receptors to promote cytotoxic T cell responses. Here, we examined the therapeutic po-
tential of combining a direct tumor-targeting mAb, anti-CD20, with an extended panel of immunomodulatory
mAbs. Only the anti-CD27/CD20 combination provided cures. This was apparent in multiple lymphoma
models, including huCD27 transgenic mice using the anti-huCD27, varlilumab. Detailed mechanistic analysis
using single-cell RNA sequencing demonstrated that anti-CD27 stimulated CD8+ T and natural killer cells to
release myeloid chemo-attractants and interferon gamma, to elicit myeloid infiltration and macrophage acti-
vation. This study demonstrates the therapeutic advantage of using an immunomodulatory mAb to regulate
lymphoid cells, which then recruit and activate myeloid cells for enhanced killing of mAb-opsonized tumors.
INTRODUCTION
Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have proven to be potent tools in
cancer treatment (reviewed in Weiner, 2015). They can be divided
into two groups based on their effector functions: direct tumor-
targeting mAbs, such as anti-CD20, anti-Her2, and anti-EGFR
target the tumor directly through innate effectors, whereas immu-
nomodulatory mAbs (e.g., anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-CTLA-4,
and anti-CD40) activate the adaptive immune system. It is gener-
ally agreed that direct-targeting mAbs exert their anti-tumor
activity by recruiting FcgR-expressing cellular effectors or by
blocking oncogenic signaling (Yakes et al., 2002; Gong et al.,
2005; Uchida et al., 2004; Beers et al., 2010), whereas immuno-
modulators
either
remove
inhibitory
signaling
(checkpoint
blockers) or directly stimulate immune effector cells (immunosti-
mulatory mAbs). It has previously been shown that, when com-
bined, certain immunomodulatory mAbs (e.g., 4-1BB) can
improve the anti-tumor efficacy of direct tumor-targeting mAbs
(CD20)
(Souza-Fonseca-Guimaraes
et
al.,
2016)
through
enhancement of natural killer (NK) cell-mediated antibody-
dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) (Gill et al., 2012; Kohrt
et al., 2011), which has moved to the clinical setting for validation.
Apart from these data, there are few other studies examining the
combination of direct tumor-targeting and immunomodulatory
mAbs. To this end, we examined whether the anti-tumor efficacy
of the archetypal direct-targeting mAb, anti-CD20, could be
enhanced by different immunomodulatory mAbs.
CD27 is a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR)
superfamily and exists as a type 1 transmembrane, disulfide-
linked homodimer (van Lier et al., 1987). Unlike other TNFR
members, which are only expressed following activation, CD27
is constitutively present on all subsets of T cells (van Lier et al.,
Significance
Direct tumor-targeting mAbs kill tumors primarily through macrophage-mediated phagocytosis and have demonstrated ac-
tivity in numerous different cancers. However, these responses are often partial and transient. We now show that the effi-
cacy of these mAbs can be enhanced by increasing the activity and number of macrophages available to phagocytose
opsonized tumor cells. This can be achieved indirectly through stimulation of CD27, a costimulatory receptor expressed
constitutively on T and NK cells. Activation of these cells triggers the release of chemokines and cytokines that attract
and activate macrophages. We describe the unexpected effects of this immunomodulatory mAb and how it can be har-
nessed to improve the anti-tumor efficacy of direct tumor-targeting antibodies in multiple tumor types.

(Xiao et al., 2004). Upon T cell activation, CD27 expression is
further transiently upregulated (de Jong et al., 1991). On T cells,
the simultaneous engagement of the T cell receptor (TCR) and
CD27, such as by its ligand, CD70, is required for its costimulatory
effects (Arens et al., 2001; Keller et al., 2008). CD70-CD27 interac-
tion leads to recruitment of TNFR-associated factor (TRAF) pro-
teins to the CD27 cytoplasmic tail (Akiba et al., 1998; Gravestein
et al., 1998). Subsequent activation of canonical and non-canon-
ical nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB) and c-Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK)
signaling pathways follows to elicit cellular responses (Ramak-
rishnan et al., 2004) involving CD8+ T cell priming, proliferation,
survival, and cytotoxicity (Carr et al., 2006; Rowley and Al-Sham-
khani, 2004; Tarabanetal., 2006).Onothercell types,CD70/CD27
interaction supports B cell expansion in the germinal center
(Xiao et al., 2004). A subset of NK cells also express CD27, and
here engagement of CD27 has been shown to increase interferon

gamma (IFNg) secretion, albeit without a
concomitant enhancement of NK cytotox-
icity (Takeda et al., 2000). The anti-tumor
effect of CD27 ligation has been demon-
strated in murine B cell lymphoma (French
et al., 2007) and melanoma models (Rob-
erts et al., 2010), and preliminary results
of the phase I studies of the anti-human
CD27 mAb, varlilumab demonstrate that
it is well tolerated and has anti-tumor effi-
cacy (Burris et al., 2017).

Therapeutic Efficacy
As
an

to
investigate
whether
the
therapeutic
efficacy
of
anti-CD20 could be enhanced by com-
bination with immunomodulatory mAbs,
we used the syngeneic, immunocompe-
tent murine B cell lymphoma model,
BCL1 (Slavin and Strober, 1978). Anti-
CD20
was
tested
in
combination
with mAbs to costimulatory receptors,
OX40,
4-1BB,
GITR,
or
checkpoint
blockers TIGIT, PD-L1, PD-1, or CTLA-4 (Figures 1A–1F).
Anti-CD20 alone provided a modest survival benefit with a me-
dian survival of 29.5 days compared with 21 days with control
mice. When anti-CD20 was combined with immunomodulatory
reagents, only anti-OX40 provided a modest benefit with a
median survival of 45.5 days (Figure 1A), with the other
reagents providing small, non-statistically significant improve-
ments in tumor control. 4-1BB mAb was highly effective as a
single agent in this model, with 56% of mice surviving beyond
100 days, but addition of anti-CD20 did not improve its thera-
peutic efficacy (Figure 1F).

 anti-CD20-treated mice, but, significantly, when given in com-
bination with anti-CD20, 100% of the mice were cured beyond
100 days.
To ensure that the therapeutic benefit of anti-CD20/CD27
therapy was not confined to the BCL1 model, the combination
was also tested in the A31 B cell lymphoma (Cobb et al., 1986)
(Figure 2B) and Em-TCL1, B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia (Bichi
et al., 2002) models (Figures 2C–2E). In both models, anti-CD20
alone provided a modest therapeutic benefit. Anti-CD27 alone
also improved survival of tumor-bearing mice, particularly in
the A31 model. However, in combination, a significant improve-
ment was observed, with all mice surviving beyond 100 days. In
the Em-TCL1 model, therapy provided by either anti-CD20 or
anti-CD27 alone was minimal (Figures 2C–2E), yet the combi-
nation delivered efficient tumor depletion, leading to experi-
mental cures.
We also examined anti-CD27 with another direct tumor-tar-
geting mAb, anti-gp75, in the B16F10 melanoma model (Figures
2F and 2G), where peritoneal metastases were assessed on day
13 after tumor inoculation (Otten et al., 2008). Anti-gp75 and anti-
CD27 individually had some activity in reducing tumor burden
but the combination was superior (Figure 2G).

 These investigations demonstrate that agonistic anti-CD27
can improve the anti-tumor efficacy of a tumor-targeting mAb
to B cell lymphoma in a way not seen with other immunomodu-
latory mAbs.
Combination Therapy Is Partly Dependent on T Cells
Subsequent investigations aimed to dissect the mechanism by
which anti-CD27 enhances anti-CD20 therapy. First, we exam-
ined the expression of CD27 on the B cell tumors examined,
alongside potential immune effectors (Figures S1A and S1B).
Anti-CD27 did not bind to BCL1, A31, or Em-TCL1, and so is
not acting as a direct tumor-targeting mAb. Consistent with pre-
vious reports (Sugita et al., 1992; van Lier et al., 1987), CD27 was
expressed constitutively on NK cells and all subsets of T cells.
Given that CD27 is a well-described costimulatory receptor on
T cells, we examined the effect on T cells in the BCL1 model.
BCL1-bearing mice treated with anti-CD27 and anti-CD20/
CD27
had
nearly
3-fold
more
activated
CD8+
T
cells
(CD62LhiCD44+ and CD62LloCD44+) in the spleen than control
and anti-CD20-treated mice on day 13 (Figures 3A and 3B).
Further, there was a significant increase in the number of CD8+
T cells in the anti-CD20/CD27 group compared with anti-CD20
alone (median 13.6 3 106 versus 3.6 3 106, respectively) (Fig-
ure 3C). A marked increase in CD8+ T cell count was also
observed with anti-CD27 alone (median 15.6 3 106), and this
was significantly different compared with the control group (me-
dian 8.8 3 106). Increased numbers of regulatory T cells (Tregs)
were also observed with anti-CD27- and combination-treated
groups. Despite the increase in Tregs, the total CD8+/Treg ratio
was higher in the combination group compared with anti-CD20
alone (medians 5.9 versus 3.2, respectively).
When the spleens of control and treated BCL1-bearing ani-
mals were examined on days 6 and 9 by immunohistochemistry,
a change was observed in the pattern of CD8 staining (Figure 3D).
In control and anti-CD20 treated mice, CD8+ staining was
confined to the interfollicular regions. In contrast, in anti-CD27-
and combination-treated mice, staining was observed in both
the interfollicular and follicular regions on day 6 and throughout
the whole spleen on day 9. This demonstrates that anti-CD27
given alone, or in combination with anti-CD20, alters the CD8+
T cell distribution.
Altogether, this and published data (French et al., 2007) sug-
gest that anti-CD27’s anti-tumor effect is in part mediated by
CD8+ T cells. To directly assess their contribution to the immuno-
therapy in the BCL1 model, we depleted CD4+, CD8+, or both
CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (Figure 3E). As expected, deletion of
both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells abrogated anti-CD27 monotherapy.
Deletion of either CD4+ or CD8+ alone had minimal impact, but
deletion of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells together reduced thera-
peutic efficacy of the combination therapy, albeit incompletely.
This suggests that, while T cells are important, additional mech-
anisms of tumor killing compensate for the loss of T cell cytotox-
icity in the anti-CD20/CD27-treated cohorts.
The Contribution of NK Cells to Anti-CD20/CD27
Combination Therapy
The other main population of immune effector cells that express
CD27 are NK cells, so we explored the ability of anti-CD27 to
activate these cells in vivo. Naive wild-type (WT), Fcgr3�/�
(FcgRIII�/�) or SCID (severe combined immune deficiency)
mice were treated with a single dose of anti-CD27, and the
expression of the activation marker, KLRG1, was monitored on
peripheral blood NK cells (Figures S2A and S2B). Treatment
with anti-CD27 or anti-CD20/CD27 resulted in a �20% increase
in KLRG1+ NK cells compared with controls in WT mice. A similar
level of increase was also observed in FcgRIII�/� mice, indicating
that NK activation occurred directly via CD27 and not via
Fc-FcgR binding (through FcgRIII). Equally, the increase of
KLRG1+ NK cells in SCID mice indicates that NK activation
does not occur indirectly via CD27-mediated T cell activation
as T cells are absent in these mice.
To directly investigate the contribution of NK cells to therapy,
they were depleted in the BCL1 model (Figure 3F) using appro-
priate doses and formulations of anti-asialo GM1 (Turaj et al.,
2017). NK depletion alone did not significantly alter the survival
of control or anti-CD20-treated mice. However, there was
impairment of survival in the combination-treated mice after
NK depletion compared with non-depleted mice. Thus, akin to
T cells, anti-CD27 directly activates NK cells, but anti-CD20/
CD27 therapy is not entirely dependent on them.
However, when NK and T cells were simultaneously depleted,
the therapeutic benefit of adding anti-CD27 to anti-CD20 was
abrogated, such that the mice had the same median survival
as those treated with anti-CD20 alone (control, 22 days; anti-
CD20, 30 days; combination arm with T and NK depletion,
27 days) (Figure 3G). Thus, the therapeutic efficacy of anti-
CD20/CD27 therapy requires either T or NK cells to augment
tumor control by anti-CD20 by a hitherto unknown mechanism.
Anti-CD27 Promotes Intratumoral Myeloid Cell
Infiltration
It is recognized that anti-CD20-mediated antibody-dependent
cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) is carried out by myeloid cells
(Uchida et al., 2004; Beers et al., 2010). Figures 2D and 2E
show that there is a greater level of B cell depletion when
anti-CD27 is combined with anti-CD20 in the Em-TCL1 model.
We sought to validate these findings in the BCL1 model and
to examine whether anti-CD27 altered the myeloid compart-
ment. Spleens of BCL1-bearing mice were harvested on day
9 or 13 after tumor inoculation, and tumor cells, normal B cells,
NK cells, macrophages, monocytes, and neutrophils were
enumerated (Figures 4A–4F). Consistent with observations in
the Em-TCL1 model, anti-CD20 rapidly depleted malignant
and normal B cells while minimal difference was seen in the tu-
mor load between control and anti-CD27-treated mice at these
time points (Figures 4A and 4B). Combined anti-CD20/CD27
therapy was more effective than anti-CD20 alone in depleting
B cells, most evidently with normal B cells at day 9 (means,
12.6 3 106 versus 3.8 3 106, anti-CD20 versus combination)
(Figure 4B). We observed a trend toward reduction in splenic
NK cells with anti-CD27 and combined anti-CD20/CD27 treat-
ment compared with controls, most noticeably on day 13 (Fig-
ure 4C), which is described following NK activation (Robbins
et al., 2004).
Examination of the myeloid compartment in the spleen at the
same time points demonstrated no significant changes in
macrophage numbers (Figure 4D) but marked increases in
monocytes and neutrophils (Figures 4E and 4F). There was an
780
Cancer Cell 32, 777–791, December 11, 2017
 8- to 9-fold increase in numbers of monocytes and a 5- to 7-fold
increase in neutrophils in anti-CD27 and combination arms,
compared with control and anti-CD20 alone.
A similar trend of increased myeloid cell infiltration was also
observed in the spleen when the experiment was repeated in
naive non-tumor-bearing mice (Figures 4G–4I), indicating that
these changes are CD27 related and not tumor driven. In this
case, macrophage numbers were also significantly elevated
in the combination group compared with anti-CD20 alone
(means, 2.0 3 106 versus 0.7 3 106, respectively). Monocytes

 and neutrophils were increased 6- and 7-fold, respectively (com-
bination group versus anti-CD20 alone).
The spleens of BCL1-bearing mice were also examined by
immunohistochemistry on day 9 (Figure 4J). At this time point,
the tumor burden is still low (Figure 4A) and the splenic archi-
tecture preserved, allowing changes in immune populations
to be better appreciated. Figure 4J shows clear evidence of
B cell depletion by anti-CD20 and that this is enhanced by
the addition of anti-CD27. Consistent with the flow cytometry
data (Figures 4E and 4F), there was increased monocyte and
neutrophil staining in the anti-CD27 and anti-CD20/CD27
groups but no obvious increase in macrophages at this early
time point.
Depletion of neutrophils had minimal effect on anti-CD20-
mediated B cell depletion (Figures S3A and S3B) and there
was no statistically significant impact on the survival of
anti-CD20/CD27-treated BCL1 mice (Figure S3C). Macrophage
depletion was also performed using liposomal-encapsulated
clodronate, but depletion of macrophages itself impairs BCL1
tumor growth, thus preventing us from assessing the contribu-
tion of macrophages to anti-CD20/CD27 therapy (Figure S3D).
However, we and others have previously shown that macro-
phages are the main effectors of anti-CD20-mediated B cell
depletion (Minard-Colin et al., 2008; Beers et al., 2010; Tipton
et al., 2015b).
Anti-CD27 Indirectly Promotes Infiltration and
Activation of Myeloid Cells
CD27 is not expressed on macrophages, monocytes, or neu-
trophils (Figure S3E), ruling out direct activation of these cells
by anti-CD27. We hypothesized that, upon activation by anti-
CD27, T and NK cells release chemokines and cytokines that
attract and activate myeloid cells. To investigate this, naive
mice were treated with anti-CD20, anti-CD27, or the combina-
tion, and mRNA was isolated from the spleens and analyzed
with a chemokine and cytokine gene expression array (Fig-
ure S4A). Genes that were significantly upregulated in anti-
CD27 and/or combination arms in comparison with the control
group are shown in Figure 5A. We observed increased expres-
sion of Fasl, Trail (Tnfsf10), and Ifng in mice treated with anti-
CD27 ± anti-CD20, supportive of increased T and/or NK
cytotoxicity. Cxcl9, which is associated with a TH1 response,
and T cell trafficking (Guirnalda et al., 2013; Loetscher et al.,
1996) was also increased, in line with the changes observed
in Figure 3D. Conversely, no significant change was observed
in cytokines associated with TH2 responses, such as Il4, Il5,
and Il13 (Figure S4A). Furthermore, chemokines associated
with myeloid cell trafficking, such as Ccl3 and Ccl4, were
elevated in mice treated with anti-CD20, anti-CD27, and the
combination.
It is recognized that macrophages are phenotypically and
functionally plastic and have the capacity to both kill tumor and
promote its development (Biswas and Mantovani, 2010), with
both types capable of mediating ADCP (Dahal et al., 2017).
The upregulation of Ifng and Cxcl9 by anti-CD27, and combina-
tion therapy (Figure 5A), indicate that these treatments polarize
the macrophages toward an anti-tumor phenotype. Consistent
with these data, mice treated with anti-CD27 also upregulate
CD86 (2-fold) and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class
II (3-fold) on macrophages (Figure 5B). Furthermore, in the BCL1
tumor microenvironment, anti-CD27 and anti-CD20/CD27 also
increased the expression of FcgRIV, a key activatory FcgR
involved in mediating ADCP on murine macrophages (Hamagu-
chi et al., 2006; Biburger et al., 2011; Gul et al., 2014; Tipton et al.,
2015a) (Figure 5C). In combination treatment, FcgRIV increased
3-fold compared with anti-CD20-treated mice. No obvious
changes were observed in the expression of the other activatory
FcgRs, FcgRI, and FcgRIII or the inhibitory FcgR, FcgRII on mac-
rophages. On monocytes, anti-CD27 and combination therapy
upregulated all of the FcgRs, but the biggest change was seen
with FcgRIV, where there was a 2.5-fold upregulation compared
with anti-CD20 (Figure 5C). On neutrophils, the combination arm
upregulated all of the activatory FcgRs (FcgRI, FcgRIII, and
FcgRIV) but to a lesser degree than on macrophages and
monocytes.
To confirm that myeloid cell activation was occurring indirectly
through T and NK cells, both populations were depleted in BCL1-
bearing mice treated with anti-CD27 therapy (Figure 5D). In the
absence of T and NK cells, all the FcgRs failed to upregulate.
Further, the profound infiltration of intratumoral monocytes and
neutrophils previously observed (Figures 4E and 4F) was also
abrogated (Figure 5E).
We further hypothesized that IFNg released by anti-CD27-
activated T and/or NK cells mediated these myeloid changes
(Figure 5F). In vivo neutralization of IFNg in BCL1-treated mice
also abrogated the upregulation of FcgRIV on macrophages
and monocytes (Figures 5F and S4B). On neutrophils, the
FcgRIV upregulation was attenuated to a lesser extent (Fig-
ure S4C). FcgRI upregulation was also reduced on monocytes
and neutrophils (Figures S4B and S4C). Finally, the neutralization
of IFNg also reduced the infiltration of macrophages in the com-
bination arm but not monocytes or neutrophils (Figure S4D).
Altogether, these experiments demonstrate that the upregula-
tion of FcgRIV on myeloid cells is entirely dependent on IFNg
released by anti-CD27-activated T and/or NK cells, and
that IFNg also contributed toward intratumoral macrophage
recruitment.
To demonstrate that anti-CD27-activated macrophages have
improved ADCP capacity, peritoneal macrophages treated with
anti-CD27 in vivo were harvested and examined in an ex vivo
phagocytosis assay. Like splenic macrophages, peritoneal mac-
rophages upregulated FcgRIV �3.5-fold following anti-CD27
treatment (Figure S4E). Moreover, anti-CD27-activated macro-
phages phagocytosed significantly more anti-CD20-opsonized
B cells than isotype-control-treated macrophages (5-fold in-
crease in phagocytic index) (Figures 5G and S4F).

 Single-Cell RNA Gene Expression Profiling of Anti-
CD20/CD27 Therapy
To further characterize cell-type-specific changes elicited by
anti-CD27 treatment, single-cell RNA sequencing was per-
formed on cells isolated from spleens of BCL1-bearing mice
(day 13), treated as previously described (Figures 6A–6E and
S5A–S5F). We observed a number of changes consistent with
the flow cytometry and qPCR array data. First, there was a strik-
ing absence of B cells within the combination arm, when
compared with anti-CD20 alone (Figure 6B), indicative of
enhanced B cell depletion with combination therapy. Second,
myeloid and effector CD8+ T cells were markedly increased in
the anti-CD27 and combination arms, as illustrated by the higher
cell counts (Figure 6B) and expression of the proliferation
marker, Mki67 (Figure S5A) in these populations. Chemokines
associated with myeloid cell infiltration, specifically Ccl3 (Fig-
ure 6C), Ccl4 (Figure S5B), and Ccl5 (Figure S5C), were upregu-
lated upon anti-CD27 and combination treatment. All three
chemokines were primarily expressed in effector CD8+ T cells,
with lower levels of expression in NK cells. Cxcl9 was also upre-
gulated in macrophages with anti-CD27 and combination ther-
apy (Figure S5D). The upregulation of Ifng (Figure S5E) observed
in the qPCR array was also observed here with anti-CD27 and
combination therapy, and seen in effector CD8+ T cells, with
some expression in NK cells. Strong Fcgr4 expression (the
gene encoding FcgRIV) was observed in the granulocyte and
macrophage populations (Figure S5F), which also displayed up-
regulation of interferon response genes, Ifitm3 and Isg15 (Fig-
ures 6D and 6E).
Consistent with the previous results, these data show that
anti-CD27 activates CD8+ T cells, and to a lesser extent NK cells,
to release CCL3, CCL4, and CCL5, which potentially increases
myeloid cell infiltration. Activated CD8+ T cells release IFNg,
which activates myeloid cells, as demonstrated by increased
FcgRIV expression.
Anti-huCD27 mAb Displays Similar Activity
To confirm that these findings have relevance for humans, BCL1
cells were inoculated into human CD27 transgenic (huCD27 tg)
mice (Figure 7A). In this model, the clinical candidate anti-
huCD27 mAb, varlilumab (Vitale et al., 2012), was employed.
As before, we observed a modest improvement in survival with
anti-CD20 alone (median survival 44 days). The therapeutic
effect of anti-huCD27 monotherapy was again modest, but
when
given
in
combination
with
anti-CD20,
significantly
enhanced survival benefit was seen with >70% of mice treated
with the combination surviving >100 days compared with 0%
with either monotherapy.
In keeping with previous data, we observed enhanced B cell
depletion (Figures 7B and 7C). The proportion of NK cells was
similar for all treatment arms (Figure 7D). An increase in CD8+
T cells or Tregs was not observed with anti-CD27 and combina-
tion therapy, but overall, there was an increased CD8+/Treg ratio
in the combination arm compared with the other groups (Figures
7E–7G). A modest increase in macrophages was observed here
in the combination arm (means 0.55 versus 0.92, anti-CD20
versus combination, respectively) and, similar to the WT mouse
CD27 model, there was increased infiltration of monocytes and
neutrophils (1.8-fold and 1.6-fold, combination versus anti-
CD20) (Figures 7H–7J). Examination of FcgR expression on the
myeloid cells also demonstrated upregulation of FcgRIV on mac-
rophages, monocytes, and neutrophils in the combination arm
compared with anti-CD20 alone (Figures 7K–7M). Thus, similar
to its mouse counterpart, anti-huCD27 is capable of improving
anti-CD20-mediated B cell depletion, and this is associated
with increased myeloid infiltration and activation.
Next, we studied the in vitro effects of anti-huCD27 on periph-
eral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) derived from healthy
human donors (Figures 7N–7P and S6A–S6F). PBMCs were
incubated with anti-huCD20, anti-huCD27, or T cell-stimulating
anti-hu4-1BB for 48 hr before analysis by flow cytometry. Cul-
tures treated with anti-huCD27 contained 3-fold more mono-
cytes than cultures treated with the other mAbs (Figures 7N
and S6A) and fewer annexin V+CD14+ cells (2-fold less) (Fig-
ure S6B), suggesting that anti-huCD27 improved monocyte
viability. On further examination, the level of CD14 on monocytes
was seen to be downregulated >2-fold after anti-huCD27 treat-
ment (Figures 7O and S6C), which is recognized to be associ-
ated with differentiation into macrophages (Ohradanova-Repic
et al., 2016). In human PBMCs, CD27 is expressed predomi-
nantly on T cells (median 60% CD4+ and 91% CD8+), a small
subset of B cells (24%), and a far smaller number of NK cells
(2%), but not monocytes (Figures S6D–S6F), thereby suggesting
that downregulation of CD14 on monocytes potentially occurs
indirectly via anti-huCD27 stimulation of T cells. In support of
this, purified monocytes do not downregulate CD14 on anti-
huCD27 stimulation (median fluorescence intensity [MFI], 7183)
(Figure 7P). Re-addition of purified T cells, but not B cells,
resulted in the downregulation of CD14 on monocytes.
DISCUSSION
The success of individual mAbs in cancer therapy suggests that
combining them will enhance efficacy. However, it is not yet un-
derstood how best to combine these mAbs and which combina-
tions will be effective. Our data demonstrate a way in which an
immunostimulatory mAb, anti-CD27, can be used to augment
the activity of a direct tumor-targeting mAb (anti-CD20) to elicit
experimental cures. Anti-CD20 binds to B cells and mediates
ADCP of the mAb-opsonized cells. Addition of anti-CD27
stimulates CD8+ T cells and NK cells, inducing the release of
CCL3, CCL4, and CCL5, which potentially attract myeloid cells.
(F) Tumor-bearing mice were treated with isotype control, anti-CD20, anti-CD27, or in combination, with or without an IFNg-neutralizing mAb. Splenocytes were
harvested on day 13, and FcgR expression was examined on macrophages. n = 6–8 per group.
(G) Naive mice were treated with an isotype control or anti-CD27, and peritoneal macrophages were harvested on day 13. Macrophages were co-cultured with
carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE)-labeled huCD20 tg B cells opsonized with an isotype control or anti-CD20 for 1 hr, and CFSE and F4/80 double-
positive cells were examined. The phagocytic index is shown. Means are shown, n = 12.
Wilcoxon test was used to analyze p values in monocytes and neutrophils in (C) and (E–G), and Student’s t test for the remaining data; *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01,
***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001. See also Figure S4.

 Stimulation of CD8+ T cells, and to a lesser extent NK cells, by
anti-CD27 also induces release of IFNg, which activates macro-
phages to express more FcgRIV and promotes their inflamma-
tory capacity, thus increasing both the number of macrophages
available to perform ADCP and their phagocytic ability.
The superior therapy observed with the anti-CD20/CD27 com-
bination could be a summation of effects as anti-CD27 on its own
significantly prolongs the survival of mice in this model. Two lines
of evidence indicate that this is not the case. First, the depletion
of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells entirely abrogates anti-CD27 activity,
but not combination therapy, signifying that in combination,
alternative, synergistic mechanisms of anti-tumor activity come
into play. Second, the 4-1BB mAb was also highly effective as
monotherapy but did not result in a robust combination effect
with anti-CD20 in the BCL1 model.
There is ample evidence to support the role of CD27 as a cos-
timulatory receptor on T cells. Humans deficient in CD27 (van
Montfrans et al., 2012) or CD70 (Izawa et al., 2017) are at risk
of lymphoproliferative disorders associated with Epstein-Barr
virus (EBV) as a result of reduced proliferation of EBV-specific
T cells. Our data demonstrate that anti-CD27 monotherapy is
entirely dependent on T cells in the BCL1 lymphoma model. Simi-
larly, the anti-huCD27 mAb, varlilumab, is dependent on T cells
for therapeutic effects in EG7 lymphoma and CT26 colon carci-
noma models (He et al., 2013).
Existing literature describing the effects of CD27 stimulation
on NK cells is limited (Kelly et al., 2002; Takeda et al., 2000).
In vitro assays demonstrate that engagement of CD27 by an
agonistic mAb induces proliferation and IFNg secretion of NK
cells but without any evidence of direct cytotoxicity (Takeda
et al., 2000). In a B16cOVA model of anti-CD27 therapy, NK cells
were shown to be essential in early tumor control but dispens-
able when tumor engraftment was established (Roberts et al.,
2010). Here, Ifng upregulation was observed on both T and NK
cells with CD27 stimulation by single-cell RNA sequencing, albeit
the number of NK cells collected were small, thus reducing our
ability to detect changes in NK cells. At the protein level, evi-
dence of direct NK activation by anti-CD27 is supported by the
upregulation of KLRG1, which is expressed on mature, fully acti-
vated NK cells (Huntington et al., 2007). In a pulmonary metasta-
tic colorectal model, KLRG1+ NK cells were shown to be crucial
in protecting against tumor development in a perforin-dependent
manner (Malaise et al., 2014). Altogether, these data suggest that
anti-CD27 is able to directly stimulate NK cells to enhance cyto-
kine effector function and possibly also direct cytotoxicity.
Indeed, when anti-CD20 and anti-CD27 were administered in
combination, depletion of both T and NK cells was required to
abrogate therapy, indicating that loss of either population can
in part be compensated by anti-CD27-mediated activation of
the other.
We consistently observed increased infiltration of monocytes
and neutrophils in naive and BCL1-bearing WT and huCD27
models. Potentially, CCL3, CCL4, and CCL5 released by anti-
CD27-stimulated effector CD8+ T cells account for the myeloid
infiltration but this needs further validation. Either a genetic
model deficient for all three chemokines or simultaneous neutral-
ization of these chemokines would be required. Given the redun-
dancy between chemokines and their receptors as well as the
numerous effector cells involved here, we hypothesize that these
investigations will be complex to interpret. Nonetheless, deple-
tion of T and NK cells effectively abrogated both myeloid cell infil-
tration and activation, thereby pointing to these cells as the
source of myeloid chemo-attractants.
Previous investigations by many different groups have demon-
strated that macrophage-mediated ADCP is the main mecha-
nism by which anti-CD20 depletes tumor in syngeneic models
(Beers et al., 2010; Gong et al., 2005; Minard-Colin et al., 2008;
Uchida et al., 2004). Further, FcgRI and FcgRIV are the two crit-
ical activatory FcgRs involved in macrophage-mediated ADCP
(Biburger et al., 2011; Gul et al., 2014; Hamaguchi et al., 2006;
Tipton et al., 2015a). In our model, upregulation of FcgRIV on
macrophages, monocytes, and neutrophils, and FcgRI on mono-
cytes and neutrophils, initially suggests that either of these
phagocytic cells or FcgR might lead to enhanced ADCP ability.
Further work is required to confirm the contribution of each of
these activatory FcgRs to the enhanced phagocytosis. Depletion
of neutrophils had no effect on BCL1 survival or in vivo B cell
depletion ability, thus ruling out their contribution. While macro-
phages may be the critical immediate effectors here, the
increased numbers of monocytes might also translate to
increased macrophage numbers following subsequent mono-
cyte differentiation in the tissue.
Initially contradictory to these findings are others’ observa-
tions that tumor-associated macrophages are conventionally
associated with poor prognosis across a number of different
cancers as they have the capacity to support tumor growth
through secretion of immunosuppressive cytokines among other
mechanisms (reviewed by Weiskopf and Weissman, 2015).
Indeed, we observed that depletion of macrophages slowed
the growth of BCL1. However, these associations are largely in
the setting of chemotherapy as opposed to immunotherapy. In
this context, it must be remembered that macrophages are
also the key effectors of ADCP, and in follicular lymphoma where
rituximab is employed, increased numbers of tumor-associated
macrophages predict favorable outcome (Taskinen et al., 2007).
Most significantly, our human in vitro data corroborate our
murine findings by demonstrating that the anti-huCD27 mAb,
varlilumab, promotes monocyte viability and potentially differ-
entiation into macrophages. These effects occur via direct
CD8+ T cell stimulation as demonstrated by the lack of CD14

 downregulation on monocytes with T cell depletion. It is of partic-
ular interest that an agonistic mAb to 4-1BB did not produce the
same effects, despite being another co-stimulator receptor on
T cells. We suspect these differences are due to the fact that
CD27 is constitutively expressed, whereas 4-1BB expression
requires prior activation.
Based on these data, a phase II, multicenter clinical trial has
been initiated in relapsed and/or refractory B cell lymphoma to

 test the combination of rituximab and varlilumab. Finally, our
data indicate that anti-CD27 is also effective in enhancing direct
tumor-targeting mAbs beyond anti-CD20, such as anti-gp75 in a
melanoma model. We anticipate that anti-CD27 can be used to
enhance the effects of other direct-targeting mAbs such as
anti-CD38 in myeloma and anti-EGFR in solid tumors, and we
are in the process of investigating this.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Mice
BALB/c, CBA/H, C57BL/6 and SCID mice were supplied by Charles River Laboratories and maintained in local facilities. FcgRIII-/-
mice (Tipton et al., 2015a) were backcrossed over 10 generations onto the BALB/c background, and were gifted by Dr. Sjef Verbeek
(Leiden University). All mice were fed regular chow, had water freely and were maintained in a conventional facility. SCID mice were
maintained in a pathogen-free facility. For all experiments, age-matched (predominantly 8-12-week old) female mice were used.
Animal experiments were conducted according to the UK Home Office license guidelines and approved by the University of South-
ampton Ethical Committee. Animals were randomly assigned into experimental groups and housed together under the same condi-
tions. HuCD27 tg mice (He et al., 2013) on BALB/c background were maintained in Celldex animal facilities and used according to the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees guidelines.
Cell Lines
BCL1 (Slavin and Strober, 1978) and A31 (Cobb et al., 1986) B-cell lymphoma lines originated from female mice and were maintained
by passage in BALB/c mice or CBA/H mice, respectively. The age of the source mice are not known. Em-TCL1 cells were derived from
tumor-bearing Em-TCL1 tg mice, gifted from Dr. Egle (Salzburg Cancer Research Institute) following consent from C. Croce and
Y. Pekarsky. The cells were sourced from a female mouse aged 204 days old at the time of sacrifice. HuCD20 tg B cells used for
the ex vivo phagocytosis assay were derived from spleens of male and female huCD20 tg mice, approximately between 8 and
15 weeks of age (Beers et al., 2008). Cell lines have been authenticated by PCR (Em-TCL1) and flow cytometry (HuCD20 tg, BCL1
and A31).
Human Samples
PBMCs were obtained from healthy, anonymized adult volunteers through Southampton National Blood Service after informed
consent. As the samples were anonymized, the sex and age of the volunteers are not known. Density gradient centrifugation
(Lymphoprep, Axis-Shield) performed within 4 hr. Use of human samples was approved by the East of Scotland Research Ethics
Service, in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.

 METHOD DETAILS
Lymphocyte Isolation and Flow Cytometry
For flow cytometric analysis, cells were suspended in a single cell suspension in staining buffer (PBS with 1% w/v BSA, 0.1% w/v
sodium azide). An FcgR-blocking (2.4G2) 20 mg/ml was added for 10 min at RT prior to staining with specific antibodies for
15 min, RT. Red cell lysis was then performed (Invitrogen) for 2-3 min. The cells were then washed twice more and then analyzed
directly on fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde before collection on the flow cytometer. The FcgR blocking step was omitted with
FcgR expression was being examined. For intracellular staining, the cells were fixed and permeabilized (Ebioscience) for 30 min
at RT, before washing twice more and staining for 20 min at RT. After two more washes, cells were collected on the flow cytometer.
FACSCalibur or FACSCanto (all from BD Biosciences) were used and with data analyzed using Cytobank (Cytobank).
Peripheral blood and/or spleen suspensions were analyzed for CD8+ T subsets (anti-CD3 PerCP eFluor 70, anti-CD8 FITC, anti-
CD44 PE, anti-CD62L APC), Tregs (anti-CD3 PerCP eFluor 710, anti-CD4 FITC, anti-CD25 APC, anti-FOXP3 PE), BCL1 tumour
(anti-CD19 APC, anti-BCL1 idiotype FITC), NK cells (anti-CD3 FITC, anti-NKp46 PE, anti-CD49b PerCP eFluor 710) and myeloid cells
(anti-CD11b e450, anti-F4/80 Alexa Fluor 647, anti-Ly6g APC e780, anti-Ly6c PE Cy7) and CD27 expression (anti-human CD27 PE,
anti-mouse CD27 PE).
To enumerate myeloid cells in the spleen, tissue digestion was performed using Liberase (Sigma Aldrich) after tissue harvest as per
manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, harvested tissue was cut into small pieces and treated in Liberase TL for 15 min before mashing into
a single cell suspension.
Tumor Models
Groups of BALB/c mice (n=5-6) received 104 BCL1 or A31 cells intravenously on day 0 followed by anti-CD20 (18B12 mIgG2a, 200 mg)
on day 4 and anti-CD27 (AT124-1 rIgG2a, 50-100 mg/injection) from day 5-8 by intraperitoneal injection. Alternatively, BCL1-inocu-
lated mice received an alternative immunomodulatory mAb from day 5 onwards as specified in the legends. For the A31 model, mAb
therapy was repeated again at the same dose and sequence from day 15-18. The survival of the mice was assessed by regular
splenic palpation and through normal humane endpoints. The assessor was blinded to the treatment received by the mice.
1 x 107 Em-TCL1 cells were intraperitoneally injected into groups of 6- to 8-week old female C57BL/6 mice and leukemic burden
monitored by tail bleeds and CD5/B220 expression through flow cytometry as before (Carter et al., 2016). Animals were treated with
anti-CD20 (250 mg) and anti-CD27 (100 mg) 1 day later when more than 10% B220+CD5int lymphocytes were present in the blood.
Animals were euthanized when humane end points were reached or >80% of lymphocytes were tumor cells and WBC
counts >5 x 107/ml.
For the study of varlilumab, six-week old female BALB/c recipient mice were irradiated and reconstituted with huCD27 tg bone
marrow cells. Eight to 10-weeks after bone marrow transplantation, animals were bled and huCD27 expression inspected by flow
cytometry, before implantation with BCL1.
In Vivo Cell Depletion and IFNg Neutralization
For depletion experiments, mice were treated with YTS169 (CD8 depletion, in house), GK1.5 (CD4 depletion, in house)
and asialo-GM1 (NK depletion, BioLegend) at doses of 0.5-1 mg, 1 mg and 10-20 ml per injection, every 5 days, from day -1 to
day -16 i.p. For neutrophil depletion, mice were treated with 1A8 (BioXcell) at 0.5 mg/injection, every 3-4 days, from day 1 to day
13. For IFNg neutralization, tumor-bearing mice were treated with anti-IFNg (XMG1.2, 250 mg/injection) or an isotype control from
day 4 to 13 i.p.
Ex Vivo Phagocytosis Assay
Naı
¨ve mice were treated with an isotype control or anti-CD27 50 mg i.p. from days 1 to 4. Peritoneal macrophages were harvested on
day 8 by lavage with ice cold PBS. Cells were washed and FcgRIV expression was examined on the macrophages by flow cytometry
using FcgRIV FITC and F4/80 A647. Macrophages were resuspended in complete RPMI and plated in 96-well flat bottom plates
(5 x 105 cells per well, 100 ml volume) and rested for at least 6 hours. After resting, non-adherent cells were gently washed off, leaving
behind macrophage for as effectors. Here, purified huCD20 tg B cells (Miltenyi Biotec) were labelled ith 5 mM CFSE and opsonized
with 10 mg/ml anti-CD20 (Ritux m2a) or an isotype control (WR17 m2a) for 20 min, 4�C. The opsonized targets were then washed once
and added to macrophages (2.5 x 105 per well, 100 ml volume) and co-cultured for 1 hr at 37�C. Subsequently, co-cultures stained
with F4/80 A647 and washed before analysis by flow cytometry. Phagocytic cells were identified by double positivity for CFSE and
F4/80 A647. The phagocytic index was calculated as fold change in increase in phagocytosis seen in anti-CD27 treated group
compared to the isotype treated group expressed as 1.
Bone Marrow Isolation and Reconstitution of Mice
Eight- to 10-week old female huCD27 tg mice on BALB/c background were sacrificed and hind femora and tibiae were isolated and
muscle and soft tissue removed. Isolated bones were trimmed at both ends and bone marrow flushed with in complete RPMI until
bones were white. The collected cells were passed through a 70 mm sieve and centrifuged at 1500 rpm. Cells were resuspended in
10% v/v DMSO in fetal calf serum (FCS) and frozen in -80�C overnight before being transferred to liquid nitrogen storage until use.

 Six-week old female BALB/c recipient mice were irradiated in split doses of 5 and 4 Gy, a day apart. 2-3 x 106/recipient bone
marrow cells were thawed, washed and injected in PBS via tail veins. Recipients were housed in pathogen-free facilities and fed
acid water. Eight to 10-weeks after bone marrow transplantation, animals were bled and huCD27 expression inspected by flow
cytometry.
Antibodies
18B12 mIgG2a (anti-CD20) (Brezinsky et al., 2003) was produced in-house from published patented sequences. Parental 18B12
mIgG1 V regions were combined with mouse IgG2a constant regions (Williams et al., 2013). Ritux m2a (mIgG2a) was generated
in the similar fashion (Beers et al., 2008). AT124-1 (anti-CD27) (French et al., 2007), Mc39-16 (anti-A31 idiotype) (Tutt et al., 1998),
Mc10-6A5 (anti-BCL1 idiotype) (George et al., 1991), OX86 (anti-OX40) (al-Shamkhani et al., 1996), SAP45-9 (anti-TIGIT), LOB12.3
(anti-4-1BB), YTS169 (anti-CD8), GK1.5 (anti-CD4) were produced from the culture supernatant of hybridoma cells or stably trans-
fected Chinese hamster ovary cells.
Cytokine and Chemokine Profiling
The spleens of treated mice were harvested on day 6, snap frozen and RNA purified. RNA was converted to cDNA using the RT2 first
strand kit (Qiagen) and qPCR performed using RT2 SYBR Green qPCR mastermix (Qiagen) and RT2 profiler PCR array for mouse
cytokines and chemokines (Qiagen) as per manufacturer’s protocol. Data analysis was performed using the DDCT method and
SABiosciences PCR Array Data Analysis Web portal.
Single Cell RNA Sequencing
The spleens of mice treated with isotype controls, anti-CD20 (200 mg, day 1), anti-CD27 (100 mg day 2-5) or in combination were har-
vested on day 13 and digested with Liberase (Sigma Aldrich). Single-cells (100 cells/ul) and barcoded mRNA-binding micro-particles
(100 beads/ml) were suspended in droplets containing cell lysis buffer (�1nl; 50 cell /ml final concentration). Droplets were then broken
and collected by centrifugation and subjected to cDNA synthesis (Maxima H- RTase), introducing the molecule and cell barcode to
every transcript from a single cell (termed a ‘STAMP’). 800 STAMPs from each condition were then selected for PCR amplification
(15 cycles), library preparation (Nextera XT, Illumina) and Illumina sequencing by synthesis using a custom read 1 primer
(NextSeq-500 platform; version 2 chemistry - high output setting; 20 bp read 1, 50 bp read 2 and an 8 bp index 1). Species-mixing
experiments are routinely performed in our laboratory and have determined that our implementation of the Drop-Seq protocol
robustly achieves single-cell encapsulation and captures transcriptomes from single-cells with high specificity (98.5% of cell encap-
sulation events are single-species; data not shown). Raw sequencing reads were converted to a sorted unmapped BAM file
(FastqToSam, Picard bundled in Dropseq-tools v1.0) and filtered to remove all read-pairs with a barcode base quality of <10. The
second read was trimmed at the 5’ end to remove any TSO-adapter sequence and at the 3’ end to remove polyA tails. Reads
were aligned against mouse reference genome (mm10) using STAR aligner (v2.5.0a), then sorted/converted/merged to a BAM
with a tag ‘‘GE’’ onto reads for data extraction. The DigitalExpression program (Dropseq-tools v1.0) performed digital counting
(DGE) of the mRNA transcripts (unique molecular identifiers to avoid double counting reads/PCR duplicates) and created a DGE
matrix (one measurement per gene per cell). Cells expressing less than 300 or more than 3,000 genes were excluded from further
analysis. To normalize counts between samples, scaling factors were calculated using a trimmed mean of M-values using edgeR
(Robinson et al., 2010). Cluster-specific genes were detected using the t-test algorithm in Seurat (Rahul Satija (NA). Seurat: R toolkit
for single cell genomics. R package version 1.4.0.) (p < 1 3 10-3 was considered significant). Annotation of the resulting gene lists
relative to the coexpression atlas of the Immunological Genome Project (Heng et al., 2008) was performed using the on-line
ToppGene suite.
Immunohistochemistry
Spleens were harvested on day 9 and embedded in OCT (CellPath) and frozen in isopentane. Eight mm slices were air-dried overnight,
fixed in 100% acetone and blocked with 2.5% normal goat serum and stained for BCL1 cells (anti-BCL1 idiotype), normal B cells
(anti-B220), neutrophils (anti-Ly6c/Ly6g), macrophage (anti-F4/80) and monocyte (anti-CD14). Sections were treated with a perox-
idase inhibitor (Pierce) for 10 min before incubation with an HRP-conjugated anti-rat IgG polymer for 30 min, followed by 3,3’-diami-
nobenzidine for 5 min, and counterstained with haematoxylin (all from Vector Laboratories). Images were recorded using a CXK41
inverted microscope equipped with a CC12 color camera, Plan Achromat 4 x 0.25 objective lens and Cell B software (all from
Olympus).
In Vitro Human PBMC Based Assays
PBMCs were cultured using serum-free media (CTL-Test Medium, CTL) supplemented with glutamine (2 mM), pyruvate (1 mM), peni-
cillin, and streptomycin (100 IU/mL) at 37�C in 5% CO2. Cells were cultured in a 24-well plate at 1x107 cells/ml (1.5 x107 cells/well) and
stimulated with cetuximab and rituximab (both from Southampton General Hospital oncology pharmacy), anti-4-1BB (clone 3/28, in
house) or varlilumab (Celldex Therapeutics) at 5 mg/mL for 48 hr. Post culture, PBMCs were labelled with anti-CD14-Pacific Blue
(Biolegend) and analyzed on the flow cytometer. To assess viability, annexin-V FITC staining was simultaneously performed.
Monocytes, T cells and B cells were purified using negative magnetic selection as per manufacturer’s protocols (Miltenyi Biotec).
T cells and B cells were added back monocytes in a ratio of 5:1 and 1:1, respectively. Cells were then culture as described above.

 QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using Graphpad Prism version 6. Normality was tested using the D’Agostino and Pearson, and
Shapiro-Wilk tests, and transformed into logarithmic form to assess for log normal distribution. Subsequently, a two-tailed Student’s
t test was used to analyze parametric data and non-parametric data was analyzed by a Mann-Whitney test (unpaired data) or Wil-
coxon test (paired data). To assess survival differences in immunotherapy experiments, Kaplan-Meier curves were produced and
analyzed by log-rank testing. p values <0.05 were regarded as statistically significant.
