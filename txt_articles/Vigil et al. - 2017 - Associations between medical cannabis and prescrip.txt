Abstract
Background
Current levels and dangers of opioid use in the U.S. warrant the investigation of harm-reduc-
ing treatment alternatives.
Purpose
A preliminary, historical, cohort study was used to examine the association between enroll-
ment in the New Mexico Medical Cannabis Program (MCP) and opioid prescription use.
Methods
Thirty-seven habitual opioid using, chronic pain patients (mean age = 54 years; 54% male;
86% chronic back pain) enrolled in the MCP between 4/1/2010 and 10/3/2015 were com-
pared to 29 non-enrolled patients (mean age = 60 years; 69% male; 100% chronic back
pain). We used Prescription Monitoring Program opioid records over a 21 month period (first
three months prior to enrollment for the MCP patients) to measure cessation (defined as the
absence of opioid prescriptions activity during the last three months of observation) and
reduction (calculated in average daily intravenous [IV] morphine dosages). MCP patient-
reported benefits and side effects of using cannabis one year after enrollment were also
collected.
Results
By the end of the 21 month observation period, MCP enrollment was associated with 17.27
higher age- and gender-adjusted odds of ceasing opioid prescriptions (CI 1.89 to 157.36,
p = 0.012), 5.12 higher odds of reducing daily prescription opioid dosages (CI 1.56 to 16.88,
p = 0.007), and a 47 percentage point reduction in daily opioid dosages relative to a mean
change of positive 10.4 percentage points in the comparison group (CI -90.68 to -3.59, p =
0.034). The monthly trend in opioid prescriptions over time was negative among MCP
patients (-0.64mg IV morphine, CI -1.10 to -0.18, p = 0.008), but not statistically different

 from zero in the comparison group (0.18mg IV morphine, CI -0.02 to 0.39, p = 0.081). Sur-
vey responses indicated improvements in pain reduction, quality of life, social life, activity
levels, and concentration, and few side effects from using cannabis one year after enroll-
ment in the MCP (ps<0.001).
Conclusions
The clinically and statistically significant evidence of an association between MCP enroll-
ment and opioid prescription cessation and reductions and improved quality of life warrants
further investigations on cannabis as a potential alternative to prescription opioids for treat-
ing chronic pain.
Introduction
Opioid-related drug overdoses, the current leading cause of preventable deaths in the United
State (U.S.), kill roughly 91 Americans every day.[1,2] Conventional pharmaceutical medica-
tions for treating opioid addiction, such as methadone and buprenorphine-tapering, can be
similarly dangerous due to substantial risks of lethal drug interactions and overdose.[1,3,4]
Other medications aimed at reducing the adverse symptoms of opioid withdrawal (e.g.,
α2-adrenergic agonists, benzodiazepines, antiemetics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
agents) are not designed to treat patients’ underlying health condition, often chronic pain,[5]
leaving patients with limited long-term pharmaceutical treatment options. Whole, natural
Cannabis sativa and extracts made from the plant may serve as an alternative to opioid-based
medications for treating chronic pain.
Cannabis has been investigated as a potential treatment for a wide range of medical condi-
tions from post-traumatic stress disorder[6] to cancer,[7,8] with the most consistent support
for the treatment of chronic pain, epilepsy, and spasticity.[9–11] In the U.S., states have
enacted Medical Cannabis Programs (MCPs) in part for people with chronic, debilitating pain
who cannot be adequately or safely treated with conventional pharmaceutical medications.
MCPs are unique, not only because they allow patients to self-manage their cannabis treat-
ment, but because they operate in conflict with U.S. federal law, making it challenging for
researchers to utilize conventional research designs to measure their efficacy. To date, no
study has used a randomized controlled trial to measure the effects of MCP enrollment, and
hence the ability to legally self-manage cannabis therapy, on patient outcomes. State-level
analyses, show that the implementation of MCPs is correlated with clinically and statistically
significantly lower opioid-related mortality rates and reductions in the number and cost of
prescription medications used by Medicare patients,[12–14] suggesting that some patients use
cannabis as a substitute for conventional pharmaceutical treatments.[15–17]
New Mexico (NM) is among the U.S. states hardest hit by the current opioid epidemic,
although the number of opioid-related overdose deaths appears to have fallen in recent years,
[2] perhaps the result of increased enrollment in the NM MCP, which currently includes
nearly 50,000 patients. Using informal surveys of patients enrolled in the MCP, we discovered
a significant proportion of chronic pain patients reported substituting their opioid prescrip-
tions with cannabis for treating their chronic pain. In this preliminary study, we tested that
possibility using a historical, cohort research design in which we measured how opioid pre-
scription patterns compared between habitual prescription opioid-using chronic pain patients
who self-selected into the NM MCP and patients that declined the option to enroll in the MCP

 and did not use cannabis during the same time period, using opioid prescription records as a
proxy for opioid consumption. A recent study conducted in Israel found that physician-
directed cannabis treatment was associated with improved functionality, reduced pain, and
fewer opioid prescriptions in cannabis-naïve, chronic pain patients at a six month follow-up.
[18] The current study advances that work by establishing a reliable measurement of pre-MCP
enrollment (baseline) opioid prescriptions, comparing MCP enrollees to a medically and
demographically similar group of non-enrolled and non-cannabis-using patients, and observ-
ing both groups for an average of 21 months.
Methods
Study design
This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of New Mexico;
the data was treated confidentially, and the IRB waived the need for patient consent. Using a
historical, cohort research design, we measured the effect of enrollment in the NM MCP on
opioid prescription patterns in response to patient reports of changes in pain reduction and
improved quality of life among enrollees. As in other states, New Mexico only permits medical
cannabis use for patients with certain debilitating medical conditions. All the patients in our
study had a diagnosis of “severe chronic pain,” annually validated by two independent physi-
cians, including a board-certified specialist (APR).
Although enrollment in the MCP requires physician referrals, once enrolled, patients can
self-manage the potency, frequency, and particular type of cannabis product used (e.g., strain
of whole dried flower, edible, or extract) in place of, or in conjunction with, conventional phar-
maceutical medication treatments. The single-physician rehabilitation clinic (Albuquerque,
NM) where the study took place provides all eligible patients with the opportunity to enroll
in the MCP, an option which roughly one third of chronic pain patients decide to explore; all
of the patients in the current study were invited to enroll in the MCP by the same referring
physician between 2010 and 2015. Patients who decided to enroll in the MCP received no
direct medical supervision over their cannabis treatment, and were not provided any explicit
instructions for altering (e.g., reducing) their opioid prescription usage in line with the clinic’s
approach to providing palliative care through patient education and self-management of avail-
able treatment options. Although all the patients in the study were receiving treatment for
chronic pain at the single-physician (APR) rehabilitation clinic it was common for patients to
receive opioid prescriptions from multiple physicians at other clinics (S1 Text).
The MCP patients in the current study were initially recruited to complete an informal sur-
vey regarding their experience with the MCP at the time of the medical examination necessary
for renewal of their MCP license. One hundred and forty-six patients who enrolled in the
MCP between 4/1/2010 and 10/3/2015 completed the surveys. In order to assess opioid pre-
scription patterns among these patients, records from the New Mexico Prescription Monitor-
ing Program were retrieved for the 21 month period spanning from three months pre-
enrollment through 18 months post-enrollment. All opioid prescription medications in the
Prescription Monitoring Program data were first normalized into milligrams of IV morphine
using the GLOBALRPh equivalency calculator,[19] and intravenous morphine (IV, 3:1 oral
dosage equivalency) was used to measure patient-level opioid consumption levels.
To create a comparison group, patients from the same rehabilitation clinic that met the fol-
lowing criteria were initially selected: having a diagnosis of one of the three most common
chronic back pain conditions; ICD-10 codes: M54.5 (chronic low back pain, multiple sites in
spine), M54.2 (cervicalgia, cervical spine/neck pain), or M96.1 (post-laminectomy, failed
decompression surgery syndrome); having been offered and declining the invitation to enroll

 in the MCP between 2010 and 2015; and no current usage of cannabis (verified by random
urine analyses conducted approximately every six months during the observation period).
This resulted in an initial sample of 53 non-enrolled patients whose prescription records were
retrieved over a 21-month period dating from 10/08/2014 through 07/06/2016.
Next, from our initial pool of 146 MPC and 53 non-MCP patients, we included in our sam-
ple only patients filling at least two opioid prescriptions during the three months prior to
enrollment for the MCP patients and during the first three months of observation for the com-
parison group, patients with musculoskeletal disorders, and patients with maximum daily dos-
ages of less than 200 mg IV morphine. Eighty-seven MCP patients and fifteen patients in the
comparison group did not fill any opioid prescriptions during the first three months and were
excluded from the analyses. An additional 18 MCP patients and 9 comparison group patients
filled only one opioid prescription in the first three months and were also excluded. One rheu-
matoid arthritis patient was dropped from the MCP group as having an inflammatory, rather
than musculoskeletal disorder. Three other MCP patients received maximum dosages of over
200 mg IV morphine and were dropped as outliers and due to a high possibility of diversion.
(S1 Table)
The final sample of habitual opioid users included 37 MCP patients with chronic musculo-
skeletal and predominantly back pain disorders (mean age = 54 years; 54% male; 86% back
pain, 5% knee pain, 3% hip pain, 3% wrist pain, and 3% shoulder pain) and 29 comparison
group patients (mean age = 60 years; 69% male; 100% back pain). Due to a recent enrollment
date, PMP records were available for only sixteen months for one MCP patient. Four MCP
patients had records available for 19 months, seven for 20 months and the remaining 25 for a
full 21 months, resulting in an average of 20.6 (± .90) months of observation. All comparison
group patients had a full 21 months of Prescription Monitoring Program records retrieved.
Study outcomes
In our patient-level analysis, Ceased Opioid Prescriptions is a dichotomous {0,1} variable with
“0” defined as no Prescription Monitoring Program evidence of an opioid prescription filled
during the last three months of observation and “1” defined as any opioid prescription filled
during that time period. Reduction in Prescribed Daily Opioid Dosage measures whether the
average prescribed daily dosage of IV morphine was lower in the last three months than in the
first three months of observation (pre-enrollment for MCP patients). Percentage Point Change
in Prescribed Daily Opioid Dosage measures the difference between the average daily dosage in
the first and last three months of observation divided by the average daily dosage in the first
three months of observation.
In our longitudinal analysis, we converted the prescription-level data from the Prescription
Monitoring Program into a patient-month level panel by aggregating dosages and quantities
across prescriptions filled each month (for each patient) in order to generate a mean daily dos-
age per month (mg IV morphine.)
The survey questions (S2 Text) measured existence of side effects, pain levels prior to and
following enrollment in the MCP, and effects of cannabis use on quality of life, social life, activ-
ity levels, and concentration.
Statistical analysis
We used a logistic regression model to estimate the effect of MCP participation on cessation of
prescribed opioids (absence of opioid prescriptions coded “0”, presence of an opioid prescrip-
tion coded “1”) and on whether or not patients reduced their average daily prescribed dosage
between the first three months (pre-enrollment for MCP patients) and the last three months of

 observation. A least squares approach was used to analyze the effect of MCP participation on
the percentage change in opioid prescriptions. In all cases, we control for age and gender. We
report odds ratios for the dichotomous outcomes, and for the percentage change in opioid pre-
scriptions, the coefficient is reported. Reported 95% confidence intervals are based on hetero-
skedasticity-robust standard errors.
A least squares approach also was used for the longitudinal analysis of the monthly change
in the daily dosage (mg IV morphine) associated with MCP participation. We regressed the
daily dosage on MCP participation, a month-level trend, and the interaction between MCP
participation and a month-level trend, controlling for gender and age. Given the disparity in
the average starting opioid prescription dosages, we also analyzed the within-patient differ-
ences in opioid prescriptions over time, controlling for time-invariant patient-level character-
istics through the use of patient-level dummy variables. Because group participation does not
vary over time, we include only MCP patients in the within-patient analysis. Standard errors
were clustered at the patient-level to control for heteroskedasticity and arbitrary correlation.
Due to the small sample size, limited covariates, and the lack of variation in many of the
survey responses, we used simple univariate hypotheses tests and graphical analyses for these
outcomes.
Statistical analyses were conducted using Stata/SE 13.1.
Results
Reductions, cessation, and trends in opioid prescription patterns
The descriptive information in Table 1 suggests that MCP patients were more likely either to
reduce daily opioid prescription dosages between the beginning and end of the sample period
(83.8% versus 44.8%) or to cease filling opioid prescriptions altogether (40.5% versus 3.4%).
The percentage point change in daily opioid prescription dosages also differed between the
two groups with MCP patients reducing their dosages by 47 percentage points, while the com-
parison group increased dosages by 10.4 percentage points.
The odds ratios reported in Panels A and B of Table 2 support the simple means compari-
son results from Table 1. Not surprisingly, given that only one member of the comparison

Notes: In Panel A, Ceased Opioid Prescriptions means that the patient did not fill any opioid prescriptions in
the last three months of observation. In Panel B, Reduced Prescribed Daily Opioid Dosage means the
patient reduced their average daily dosage of prescribed opioids (Table 2 continued) between the first three
months of observation and the last three months of observation. In Panel C, Percentage Point Change in
Opioid Prescriptions equals the mean prescribed daily dosage during the last three months of observation
minus the mean prescribed daily dosage during the first three months of observation divided by the mean
prescribed daily dosage in the first three months of observation; the percentage point change associated
with MCP enrollment is reported. In Panel D, the linear trend analysis shows the change in milligrams of IV
morphine over time associated with MCP enrollment, starting with enrollment for the MCP patients and at
the beginning of the fourth month of observation for the comparison group. Panel E shows fixed-effects
regressions (at the patient level) of the mean prescribed daily dosage on three month groups starting with
the pre-enrollment period and continuing through 18 months post-enrollment. The reported coefficients
show the effect on mean prescribed daily opioid dosages of being within a given three month period post-
enrollment relative to being in the three month pre-enrollment period. Standard errors are robust to
heteroskedasticity in Panels A through C and are robust to heteroskedasticity and intra-patient arbitrary
correlation in Panels D and E.

 group (mean = 10.4% increase), suggesting that the effect of the MCP on opioid prescription
patterns did not vary significantly by gender or age in our sample.
In order to capture the variation over time in the Prescription Monitoring Program records
for each patient, we also created a patient-month level dataset. Fig 1 shows the relationship in
the raw data between time (measured in months) and average daily opioid prescription dosage
of IV morphine (mg) using a scatter plot. Linear time trends were overlaid for each group.
According to Fig 1, the MCP patients appear to have started at higher dosages than the compar-
ison group, but while the MCP patients’ opioid prescription dosages declined over time, the
comparison group’s stayed flat or may even have increased slightly. The regression results in
Panel D and E of Table 2 further explore this longitudinal relationship. Panel D replicates Fig 1,
adjusting for age and gender. MCP patients started at higher prescribed dosages than the com-
parison group (12.47mg IV morphine higher, CI 2.48 to 22.46, p = 0.015) and although the
overall effect of the linear trend is positive (0.18mg IV morphine, CI -0.02 to 0.39, p = 0.08),
albeit statistically insignificant, the coefficient on the linear time trend-MCP interaction shows
a 0.64mg reduction in the daily opioid prescription dosage of IV morphine per month (CI -1.10
to -0.18, p = 0.008) among MCP patients. Combining the trend coefficients implies that on
average, MCP patients were prescribed a lower average daily dosage of IV morphine than the
comparison group after about 15.2 months of enrollment ([12.47/(0.64+0.18)] = 15.21 months.)
Panel B showed that MCP patients had higher odds of reducing daily opioid prescription
dosages during our observation period. The results in Panel E indicate how the reduction in
opioid prescriptions among MCP patients occurred over time by comparing across three
month groups, controlling for time-invariant patient characteristics. The coefficient for the
first three months post-enrollment is negative, but statistically insignificant; for the fourth

enrollment for the MCP patients (n = 37) and the fourth month of observation for the comparison group
(n = 29). The time trends add a linear representation of the relative change in prescribed daily opioid dosage
starting with the time of treatment (enrollment in the MCP).

 through sixth month post-enrollment, the coefficient is larger but still statistically insignificant
at conventional levels. For the following three month periods, from month 7 through month
18 post-enrollment, all coefficients are large, negative, and statistically significant. The coeffi-
cients also increase in size and show that by the last three month group (months 19 through
21), the average MCP patient was prescribed 11.43 fewer milligrams of IV morphine per day
than she or he was in the pre-enrollment period.
We conducted robustness checks adjusting our inclusion criteria to ensure a closer match
between our MCP patients with our Comparison patients. Although any restriction reduces
the already small sample size, we found that restricting the sample to only back pain patients
(8 MCP patients excluded), to only patients between the ages of 30 and 70 (2 MCP patients
and 6 Comparison patients excluded), or using a stricter criteria for outliers (mean daily dos-
age in the first three months of greater than 48mg, which gives a similar mean daily dosage
across the MCP and Comparison groups and excludes six MCP patients) does not materially
affect the results in terms of magnitude and statistical significance.
In all our regressions, the 95% confidence intervals for our coefficients are large, i.e., while
the sign of our coefficients is reliable, we cannot make precise predictions regarding the size of
the effect. This could be an artifact of our small sample size or an indication that the magnitude
of the effect of MCPs on opioid prescription patterns may vary substantially across individuals
even among our relatively homogeneous patients.
Pain, quality of life, and side effects of using cannabis
Table 3 shows that respondents reported pain reduction from self-administered cannabis use
(33 of 34 patients) and a statistically significant change in pain levels from pre- to post-enroll-
ment (mean change = -3.4 on a scale of 0 to 10, p<0.001). No respondents reported any serious
side effects from cannabis use. Fig 2 shows that no patient reported “negative” or “extremely
negative” effects on Quality of Life (n = 23) or Social Life (n = 23), all but three patients
reported a “good” or “great benefit” in their Activity Level (n = 23), and the majority reported
an improvement in Concentration (n = 22) relative to prior to enrollment in the MCP.
Discussion
The current preliminary findings build upon recent studies suggesting that medical cannabis
laws result in clinically and statistically significant (up to 33%) reductions in opioid-related
causes of death [12,13] and opioid usage.[14,18] We showed that MCP enrollment, and thus
having the legal ability to self-manage cannabis therapy, reduced opioid prescriptions filled by
a small sample of habitual opioid-using, non-cancer chronic pain patients. Our observational
study circumvented some of the limitations to external validity found in the existing literature,

 e.g., a lack of comparison group, accurate baseline dosage, and/or potencies much lower than
those found in products typically used by NM MCP patients.[20,21] Consistent with previous
work suggesting that patients may substitute cannabis for prescription opioids,[14–17] over
80% of the MCP enrollees in our sample reduced their daily opioid prescription dosages, and
over 40% ceased filling opioid prescriptions altogether by 1.5 years after enrollment. In addi-
tion, MCP patients consistently reported reduced pain and improved quality of life, social
interactions, and activity levels as a result of their participation in the MCP.
The relative safety and efficacy of cannabis in comparison to that of opioid prescriptions
filled by the patients in our sample is beyond the scope of this study. However, one potential
interpretation of our results is that cannabis enables opioid-using patients to engage in their
own method of harm reduction. Several meta-analyses have shown that opioids provide only
modest immediate pain relief in people with lower back pain,[22–24] and no documented evi-
dence exists of long-term benefits for treating chronic pain.[25,26] Moreover, due to an
intense public safety campaign against the dangers of opioid prescriptions in the U.S., patients
might be increasingly aware of the associated risks including lethal overdose, abuse, behavioral
accidents, myocardial infarction, and other side effects (e.g., gastrointestinal and sexual dys-
functions).[25,27] In contrast, some recent studies have suggested that smoked Cannabis sativa
flower may be relatively safer for long-term use in adults,[28,29] generally well-tolerated by
patients,[7,30] and is not associated with an increased risk of mortality in people with or with-
out comorbid opioid, alcohol, or cocaine use disorders.[31–33] While numerous short-term
adverse events can result from cannabis use (e.g., dizziness, confusion, disorientation, loss of
balance, somnolence, hallucinations), the majority of patient-reported side effects appear to be
non-serious.[11,34] It remains unstudied how cannabis-based products (e.g., edibles,

 concentrates) and the extraction methods and solvents used to make such products affect
patient health.
Our study does have limitations, including the small sample size (underpowered statistical
analyses) and observational nature (unmeasured confounding) of the study, likely affecting the
extent of its generalizability to other patient groups. Under federal law, we could not randomly
assign patients to the MCP; rather patients self-selected into the program and then into
renewal, introducing possible selection bias if our comparison group differs fundamentally
from our MCP patients in ways that affect opioid consumption over our sample period. The
comparison group patients had previously declined referral for medical cannabis, though the
reasons are unknown but could include previous ineffective use of cannabinoids, as well as
social or financial constraints. Publicly available data from the MCP indicates that 88% of
patients who enrolled in the MCP in 2014 reenrolled in 2015, and reasons to not reenroll
could include not only a failure to experience therapeutic benefits, but also such significant
benefits that cannabis is no longer necessary or external factors such as social pressures or
employment concerns. Yet another possible source of selection bias is the statistically signifi-
cant difference in baseline opioid prescriptions between the two groups, with the MCP patients
starting off with higher average daily opioid dosages than the non-MCP patients during the
first three months of observation. It may be that the average patient must be prescribed a rela-
tively high average daily dose before she or he is willing to consider enrolling in an MCP.
Clearly we cannot rule out selection bias in our between-patient analyses. However, the
within-patient (fixed-effects) analyses support that, even after controlling for time-invariant
patient characteristics, at least those patients inclined to join an MCP show a statistically and
clinically significant reduction in opioid consumption, as measured by their prescribed aver-
age daily dose.
Another limitation was that the inclusion of only patients who renewed their MCP licenses
likely oversampled patients with an incentive to convince their medical referee that cannabis
had been an effective treatment. Although reported attrition in the MCP was low, we were
unable to measure it directly. We also were only able to measure MCP enrollment and opioid
prescriptions filled, not actual cannabis and opioid consumption, and diversion or hoarding
may have existed for both medications. Urine drug screening was also not used to verify can-
nabis or opioid use in the MCP group due to the nature of the study design (i.e., patient-gener-
ated claims that resulted in the construction of a historical cohort study). Without a longer
pre-enrollment observation period, we were not able to establish pre-existing trends in opioid
usage, and it is possible that some MCP patients were already reducing their consumption in
conjunction with seeking alternative treatments or as a result of regression towards the mean,
although mean reversion would not explain the group differences in cessation rates. Our pain
assessment method was also limited by its non-standardized, informal, and retrospective
nature, and was only completed by the MCP patients. Finally, the generalizability of our study
is likely limited in part due to the small number of patients in our sample; a single state MCP
and clinic; and demographic characteristics specific to our sample. Caution should therefore
be taken in extending the results of our study to populations thought to be at greater risk of
negative side effects.[35] Future, larger investigations should attempt to target causation and
variant patterns (e.g., rates of change) of medication usage, while controlling of relevant indi-
vidual-level factors (e.g., life-histories, current social environments, setting of substance
usage), and incorporate more comprehensive bio- and psychometric outcomes/effects assess-
ments through the implementation of creative research designs that can operate around the
current federal barriers for conducting medical cannabis research in the U.S.[20]
Despite the current study’s limitations, the results from this preliminary study showed a
strong correlation between enrollment in an MCP and cessation or reduction of opioid use.

 From a harm reduction standpoint, our results highlight the necessity of more extensive
research into the possible use of cannabis as a substitute for opioid painkillers, especially in the
form of placebo-based, randomized controlled trials and larger sample pragmatic studies.[36]
The economic impact of cannabis treatment may also be considered given the current burden
of opioid prescriptions on healthcare systems, which have been forced to implement costly
modifications to general patient care practices, including prescription monitoring programs,
drug screening, more frequent doctor-patient interactions, treatment of drug abuse and
dependence, and legal products and services associated with limiting opioid-related liability.
[37] In summary, if cannabis can serve as an alternative to prescription opioids for at least
some patients, legislators and the medical community may want to consider medical cannabis
programs as a potential tool for combating the current opioid epidemic.[14,38]
