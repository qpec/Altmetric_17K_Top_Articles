Summary: Helicobacter pylori specifically colonizes the human gastric epithelium and is the 
38 
major causative agent for ulcer disease and gastric cancer development. Here we identified 
39 
members of the carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule (CEACAM) family 
40 
as novel receptors of H. pylori and show that HopQ is the surface-exposed adhesin that 
41 
specifically binds human CEACAM1, CEACAM3, CEACAM5 and CEACAM6. HopQ - 
42 
CEACAM binding is glycan-independent and targeted to the N-domain. H. pylori binding 
43 
induces CEACAM1 mediated signaling, and the HopQ-CEACAM1 interaction enables 
44 
translocation of the virulence factor CagA into host cells, and enhances the release of pro-
45 
inflammatory mediators such as interleukin-8. Based on the crystal structure of HopQ, we 
46 
found that a β-hairpin insertion (HopQ-ID) in HopQ’s extracellular 3+4 helix bundle domain 
47 
is important for CEACAM binding. A peptide derived from this domain competitively 
48 
inhibits HopQ-mediated activation of the Cag virulence pathway, as genetic or antibody-
49 
mediated abrogation of the HopQ function shows. Together, our data imply the HopQ-
50 
CEACAM1 interaction as potentially promising novel therapeutic target to combat H. pylori-
51 
associated diseases.  
52

Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is one of the most prevalent human pathogens, 
54 
colonizing half of the world’s population. Chronic inflammation elicited by this bacterium is 
55 
the main cause of gastric cancer1.  During co-evolution with it’s human host over more than 
56 
60.000 years2, the bacterium has acquired numerous adaptations for the long-term survival 
57 
within its unique niche, the stomach. This includes the ability to buffer the extreme acidity of 
58 
this environment, the interference with cellular signaling pathways, the evasion of the human 
59 
immune response and a strong adhesive property to host cells3. Specifically, H. pylori 
60 
persistence is facilitated by the binding of BabA and SabA adhesins to the human blood group 
61 
antigen Leb and the sLex antigen, respectively4-6. However, adhesion to blood group antigens 
62 
is not universal, is dynamically regulated during the course of infection and can also be turned 
63 
off 7. We observed that H. pylori was capable of binding to human gastric epithelium of non-
64 
secretors. Therefore, we hypothesized that the bacterium might be able to interact with other 
65 
cell surface receptors to ensure persistent colonization.  
66 
We here show that the H. pylori adhesin HopQ specifically interacts with human 
67 
carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecules (CEACAMs). CEACAMs embrace 
68 
a group of immunoglobulin superfamily-related glycoproteins with a wide tissue distribution. 
69 
CEACAM1 can be expressed in leukocytes, endothelial and epithelial cells, CEACAM3 and 
70 
CEACAM8 in granulocytes, CEACAM5 and CEACAM7 in epithelial cells and CEACAM6 
71 
in epithelia and granulocytes. In epithelial cells, transmembrane anchored CEACAM1 as well 
72 
as glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked CEACAM5, CEACAM6 and CEACAM7 localize to 
73 
the apical membrane8. CEACAMs modulate diverse cellular functions such as cell adhesion, 
74 
differentiation, proliferation, and cell survival. Some CEACAMs were recognized as valuable 
75 
tumor markers due to their enlarged expression in the malignant tissue and increased sera 
76 
level9. In recent years, CEACAMs have also emerged as immunomodulatory mediators10. 
77 
Interestingly, in humans, several CEACAMs have been found to specifically interact with 
78 
bacteria such as Neisseria, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Escherichia 
79 
coli 11.  
80 
 
81 
H. pylori binds to CEACAMs expressed in human stomach 
82 
Based on the observation that H. pylori efficiently colonizes individuals in the absence of 
83 
Lewis blood group antigens12 on the one hand, and the increased expression of members of 
84 
the carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule family (CEACAMs) in gastric 
85 
tumors, we hypothesized that H. pylori may employ CEACAMs as receptors. Using pull 
86 
down and flow cytometric approaches we found a robust interaction of the H. pylori strain 
87 
 4 
 
G27 with recombinant human CEACAM1-Fc (Fig. 1a), comparable to that of Moraxella 
88 
catarrhalis (Extended Data Fig. 1a and b). As negative control, Moraxella lacunata did not 
89 
bind to human CEACAM1, nor did Campylobacter jejuni, a pathogen closely related to H. 
90 
pylori (Extended Data Fig. 1a and b). When testing for CEACAM specificity, we observed a 
91 
clear interaction of H. pylori also with CEACAM3, 5 and 6, but not with CEACAM8 (Fig.1b 
92 
and Extended Data Fig. 1c and d). Importantly, all H. pylori strains tested bound to these 
93 
CEACAMs (Extended Data Fig.1f and g) including well-characterized reference strains 
94 
(26695, J99) and the mouse-adapted strain SS1. However, binding strength differed among 
95 
strains, with some preferentially binding to CEACAM1, and others to CEACAM5 and/or 
96 
CEACAM6 (Extended Data Fig. 1f and g). We then analyzed the expression profiles of 
97 
CEACAM1, CEACAM5 and CEACAM6 in normal and inflamed human stomach tissues and 
98 
gastric cancer. If at all low levels of CEACAM1 and CEACAM5 were expressed at the apical 
99 
side of epithelial cells, and their expression, as well as that of CEACAM6, was up-regulated 
100 
upon gastritis and in gastric tumors (Fig. 1c and Extended Data Fig. 1e). During infection, H. 
101 
pylori-induced responses may thus lead to increased expression of its CEACAM-receptors.  
102 
Adhesins from other bacteria were shown to specifically bind to the N-domain of human 
103 
CEACAM113,14. Similarly, we found that lack of the CEACAM1 N-domain abolished H. 
104 
pylori binding completely (Fig. 1d). While for the interaction of Neisseria meningitidis with 
105 
CEACAM1 the N-domain was necessary but not sufficient for binding15, we observed binding 
106 
of H. pylori to all tested CEACAM1 isoforms containing the N-domain, as well as to the N-
107 
domain alone (Fig. 1e). However, binding to the N-domain alone was weaker than to the N-
108 
A1-B CEACAM1 variant, which bound less than the N-A1-B-A2 variant (Fig. 1e and 
109 
Extended Data Fig.1j), suggesting that these domains stabilize the CEACAM1-H.pylori 
110 
interaction. Comparison of the respective N-domains indicated several residues conserved in 
111 
CEACAM1, 5, and 6 but not in CEACAM8 (Extended Data Fig. 1h). 
112 
 
113 
Species specificity of Helicobacter – CEACAM interaction 
114 
Although, murine and Mongolian gerbil models are routinely used to study gastric infection 
115 
with H. pylori, the bacterium has been described so far to be naturally transmitted to only 
116 
humans and non-human primates. Although CEACAMs are found in most mammalian 
117 
species, and have a high degree of conservation, we found H. pylori to bind selectively to 
118 
human, but not to mouse, bovine or canine CEACAM1 orthologues (Fig. 2a). However, we 
119 
were surprised to find a strong interaction of H. pylori with rat-CEACAM1 (Fig. 2b and d). 
120 
This interaction was also mediated through the N-domain of rat-CEACAM1 (Fig. 2c and d). 
121 
 5 
 
To substantiate these findings, we transfected human, mouse or rat-CEACAM1 into CHO 
122 
cells, to which H. pylori does not adhere otherwise. Using confocal laser scanning 
123 
microscopy, we observed de novo adhesion of H. pylori to CHO cells expressing human and 
124 
rat, but not mouse CEACAM1 (Fig. 2e), which could be confirmed by pull down and Western 
125 
blotting of lysates from transfected cells (Fig. 2f and Extended Data Fig. 2d). This finding 
126 
makes H. pylori the first pathogen for which its CEACAM binding is not restricted to one 
127 
species. Comparing the protein sequences of the CEACAM1-N domains, several amino acids 
128 
conserved in human and rat differ in mouse (i.e. asn10, glu26, asn42, tyr48, pro59, thr66, 
129 
asn77, val79, val89, ile90, glu103, tyr108) (Extended Data Fig. 2a). In addition, our findings 
130 
of the lack of binding to mouse CEACAM1 may explain the differences seen in pathology 
131 
between infected mice and humans16. 
132 
The genus Helicobacter comprises several other spp. i.e. H. felis, suis, and bizzozeronii as 
133 
well as the human pathogenic H. bilis and H. heilmannii. When assessing the interaction of 
134 
these Helicobacters with human CEACAMs, only H. bilis bound to human CEACAM1, 5 and 
135 
6 (Extended Data Fig.2b and c). As H. pylori, H. bilis interacted with the N-domain of hu-
136 
CEACAM1 (Extended Data Fig.2b and c). This interaction may explain how H. bilis manages 
137 
to colonize human bile ducts, where high levels of constitutively expressed CEACAM1 are 
138 
present. 
139 
 
140 
HopQ is the Helicobacter adhesin interacting with CEACAMs 
141 
In order to identify the CEACAM-binding partner in Helicobacter, we initially screened a 
142 
number of Helicobacter mutants devoid of defined virulence factors that have been shown to 
143 
be implicated in various modes of host cell interaction (BabA, SabA, AlpA/B, VacA, gGT, 
144 
urease and the cagPAI)5,6,17. All of these mutants still bound to hu-CEACAM1 (Fig. 3a). 
145 
Therefore we established an immunoprecipitation approach (Extended Data Fig. 3a) using H. 
146 
pylori lysate and recombinant hu-CEACAM1-Fc coupled to protein G. Mass spectrometric 
147 
analysis of the co-precipitate identified two highly conserved H. pylori outer membrane 
148 
proteins as candidate CEACAM1 adhesins: HopQ and HopZ (Fig. 3b). Unlike a hopZ mutant, 
149 
a hopQ deletion mutant was devoid of CEACAM1 binding (Fig. 3c). Importantly, the hopQ 
150 
mutant was also unable to bind to CEACAM5 and 6 (Fig.3c).  
151 
Next we tested the binding of recombinant HopQ to different gastric cancer cell lines and 
152 
found that HopQ interacted with AGS and MKN45 both endogenously expressing 
153 
CEACAMs (Extended Data Fig.3b). HopQ did not bind to the CEACAM negative cell line 
154 
MKN28. Utilizing our CHO transfectants, we found that the recombinant HopQ interacted 
155 
 6 
 
preferentially with CEACAM1 and 5, and to lesser extent to CEACAM3 and 6. No binding 
156 
was observed to CHO cells expressing either CEACAM4, 7, or 8 (Extended Data Fig. 3c). 
157 
HopQ is a member of a H. pylori-specific family of outer membrane proteins, and shows no 
158 
significant homology to other CEACAM-binding adhesins from other Gram-negative 
159 
bacteria, i.e. Opa proteins or UspA1 from Neisseria meningitidis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae 
160 
or Moraxella catarrhalis, respectively, and is therefore a novel bacterial factor hijacking 
161 
CEACAMs. Like Opa and UspA1 13,14, HopQ targets the N-terminal domain in CEACAMs, 
162 
an interaction we found to require folded protein (see below) and was dependent on 
163 
CEACAM sequence, resulting in specificity for human CEACAM1, 3, 5 and 6. The H. pylori 
164 
hopQ gene (omp27; HP1177 in the H. pylori reference strain 26695) exhibits genetic diversity 
165 
that represents two allelic families18, type-I and type-II (Extended Data Fig. 3d), of which the 
166 
type-I allele is found more frequently in cag(+)/s1-vacA type strains. Both alleles share 75 to 
167 
80% nucleotide sequences and exhibit a homology of 70% at the amino acid level18. 
168 
Importantly, hopQ genotype shows a geographic variation, with the hopQ type-I alleles more 
169 
prevalent in Asian compared to Western strains; and was also found to correlate with strain 
170 
virulence, with type-I alleles associated with higher inflammation and gastric atrophy19. 
171 
 
172 
Structure and binding properties of the HopQ adhesin domain 
173 
HopQ belongs to a paralogous family of H. pylori outer membrane proteins (Hop’s), to which 
174 
also the blood group antigen binding adhesins BabA and SabA belong5,6,17,20.To gain insight 
175 
into its structure-function relationship we determined the binding properties and X-ray 
176 
structure of a HopQ fragment corresponding to its predicted extracellular domain (residues 
177 
17-444 of the mature protein; HopQAD; Fig. 4a). HopQAD showed strong, dose dependent 
178 
binding to the N-terminal domain of human CEACAM1 (C1ND; residues 35-142) in ELISA 
179 
(Fig. 4b) and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) revealed a 1:1 stoichiometry with a 
180 
dissociation constant of 296±40 nM (Extended Data Fig. 4a). The HopQAD X-ray structure 
181 
shows that, like BabA and SabA, the HopQ ectodomain adopts a 3+4-helix bundle topology, 
182 
though lacks the extended coiled-coil “stem” domain that connects the ectodomain to the 
183 
transmembrane region (Fig. 4a and Extended Data Fig.4d). In BabA, the carbohydrate binding 
184 
site resides fully in a 4-stranded β-domain that is inserted between helices 4 and 521 (Extended 
185 
Data Fig.4d). In HopQ, a 2-stranded β-hairpin is found in this position (residues 180-218). 
186 
Removal of the β-hairpin resulted in a soluble protein that showed a ~10 fold reduction of 
187 
CEACAM1 binding affinity (Fig. 4b and Extended Data Fig. 4c), indicating that although the 
188 
 7 
 
HopQ insertion domain is implicated in binding, it does not comprise the full binding site as 
189 
found in BabA (Fig. 4b).  
190 
The hitherto characterized Hop adhesins are lectins5,6,17,22. Instead, H. pylori was seen to 
191 
retain binding to CEACAM1 upon enzymatic deglycosylation, and Far Western analysis 
192 
revealed that HopQAD specifically bound folded, but not denatured C1ND (Fig. 4c), 
193 
suggesting HopQ-CEACAM binding relies on protein-protein rather than glycan-dependent 
194 
interactions. Indeed, ITC binding profiles of HopQAD titrated with non-glycosylated E. coli 
195 
expressed C1ND (Ec-C1ND) revealed an equimolar interaction with a dissociation constant of 
196 
417±48 nM (Extended Data Fig. 4b), showing that CEACAM N-glycosylation only provides 
197 
a minor stabilizing contribution to the HopQ-CEACAM interaction. To further map the HopQ 
198 
binding site, we pre-incubated CEACAM1 with the M. catarrhalis adhesin UspA1, and found 
199 
that this prevented binding by H. pylori (Fig. 4d), suggesting that both adhesins have 
200 
overlapping binding epitopes. In further support, mutation of CEACAM1 residues Y34 or I91 
201 
within the UspA1 binding epitope reduced or nearly abrogated CEACAM1 binding by H. 
202 
pylori (Fig. 4e). Interestingly, I91 is conserved in rat but mutated to T in mouse CEACAM1, 
203 
possibly explaining the observed species specificity in HopQ binding (Extended Data Fig. 2a, 
204 
see above). 
205 
 
206 
HopQ – CEACAM1 interaction triggers cell responses 
207 
Available animal models only partially replicate the H. pylori pathogenesis observed in its 
208 
human host and mouse CEACAMs did not support HopQ binding. Therefore, to further 
209 
investigate how HopQ may influence adhesion and cellular responses, we sought to establish 
210 
cellular pathogenesis models in which the HopQ-CEACAM mediated adhesion could be 
211 
analyzed. According to Singer et al.23, we characterized various gastric cell lines typically 
212 
employed for H. pylori in vitro experiments regarding their expression of CEACAMs, and 
213 
observed that MKN45, KatoIII and AGS did express CEACAM1, CEACAM5 and 
214 
CEACAM6, whereas MKN28 showed no presence of CEACAMs (Extended Data Fig.5a and 
215 
b). In parallel, CHO cells were stably transfected with CEACAM1-L (containing the 
216 
immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif (ITIM). Upon infection with H. pylori wild-
217 
type strain P12 and its isogenic hopQ deletion mutant, we observed a significantly reduced 
218 
adherence to CHO-CEACAM1-L, MKN45 and AGS cells when hopQ was not present, while 
219 
strains deficient in the adhesins BabA and SabA showed only slightly reduced adhesion (Fig. 
220 
5a and Extended Data Fig.5c). HopQ binding was also studied in human gastric biopsies from 
221 
H. pylori infected individuals. Here, we detected that HopQ bound to the apical side human 
222 
 8 
 
gastric epithelium and co-localized with CEACAM in biopsies from H. pylori infected 
223 
individuals (Fig. 5b and Extended Data Fig. 5d), while no binding was observed in 
224 
CEACAM1 negative samples from normal stomach (not shown). In CHO-CEACAM1-L 
225 
cells, we observed tyrosine-phosphorylation of the CEACAM1 ITIM domain upon exposure 
226 
to H. pylori, which was apparent within 5 minutes, and was maintained for up to 1 hour 
227 
(Fig.5c). Phosphorylation of the CEACAM1 ITIM domain is a well-known initial event 
228 
triggering SHP1/2 recruitment inducing downstream signaling cascades24,25. Contact-
229 
dependent signaling through CEACAMs is a common means of modulating immune 
230 
responses related to infection, inflammation and cancer10, and these immune-dampening 
231 
cascades likely reflect the multiple independent emergence of non-homologous CEACAM-
232 
interacting proteins in diverse mucosal Gram-negative pathogens including Neisseria, 
233 
Haemophilus, Escherichia, Salmonella, Moraxella sp.13,14. For H. pylori, interaction with 
234 
human CEACAM1 through HopQ may represent a critical parameter for immuno-modulatory 
235 
signaling during colonization and chronic infection of man. 
236 
Additionally, hopQ mutant H. pylori strains showed an almost complete loss of cagPAI-
237 
dependent CagA translocation (Fig. 5d) and strongly reduced IL-8 induction (Fig.5e), while 
238 
loss of other known adhesins had no effect on CagA delivery (Extended Data Fig.5e and f). 
239 
This is in line with a previous study showing that in AGS gastric cancer cells, a hopQ mutant 
240 
H. pylori strain exhibited reduced ability to activate NF-κB and altered translocation of 
241 
CagA26. In contrast to our findings, Belogolova et al. did not observe reduced adherence of a 
242 
hopQ mutant H. pylori P12 strain, which could be due to the observed growth dependent 
243 
expression of CEACAMs in these cells.  
244 
To corroborate our data in an independent model and compensate for potential clonal effects 
245 
in stably transfected cells, we transiently transfected HEK293 cells with human CEACAM (1-
246 
L,3,4,5,6,7,8) expression plasmids. Infection of these cells confirmed the defect in CagA 
247 
translocation 
observed 
in 
CHO-CEACAM1-L 
cells, 
which 
was 
restored 
upon 
248 
complementation of the hopQ mutant strain (P12ΔhopQhopQ+) (Fig.5f and Extended Data 
249 
Fig.5g). Also, cellular elongation, the so called “hummingbird phenotype”, was significantly 
250 
reduced upon deletion of hopQ (Fig. 5g and h). Further, we observed that H. pylori modulates 
251 
important host transcription factors such as Myc or STAT3, in a hopQ-dependent fashion 
252 
(Extended Data Fig. 5h). Our results reveal that HopQ-CEACAM binding leads to direct and 
253 
indirect alterations in host cell signaling cascades, and start to shed light on these HopQ-
254 
associated virulence landscapes. Given the importance of these signaling events for gastric 
255 
carcinogenesis, we explored if the CEACAM-HopQ interaction could be targeted in order to 
256 
 9 
 
prevent CagA translocation and downstream effects. Indeed, incubation of the cells with an α-
257 
CEACAM1 antibody, α-HopQ antiserum or a HopQ-derived peptide corresponding to the 
258 
Hop-ID (aa 189-220) reduced CagA translocation in a dose dependent manner (Fig. 5i-k), but 
259 
not corresponding controls (Extended Data Fig. 5h). These data demonstrate that the HopQ-
260 
CEACAM1 interaction is necessary for successful translocation of the oncoprotein CagA into 
261 
epithelial cells as well as modulation of inflammatory signaling, and that interference with 
262 
this interaction can prevent CagA translocation, giving an indication of the translational 
263 
potential of HopQ targeting for H. pylori vaccination or immunotherapy.   
264 
 
265 
Deletion of hopQ abrogates colonization in a rat model of H. pylori infection 
266 
As we have found binding of HopQ to human and rat, but not to mouse CEACAM, we finally 
267 
determined the role of HopQ in vivo, using a rat model of H. pylori infection. Having 
268 
observed that CEACAM1 was expressed in normal rat stomach (Fig. 6a and Extended Data 
269 
Fig. 6b), we infected rats with the mouse adapted strain SS1, able to bind human and rat 
270 
CEACAM1 (Extended Data Fig. 6a). While the wilt type SS1 was able to efficiently colonize 
271 
rats, albeit at lower levels compared to the mouse, (Fig. 6b) , the hopQ deficient SS1 strain 
272 
was not able to colonize rats at detectable levels, and could not induce an inflammatory 
273 
response in comparison to the wild type SS1 strain (Fig. 6b and c). Therefore, in this model, 
274 
HopQ seems also to serve as an important factor to mediate H. pylori colonization. While 
275 
infection of rats with H. pylori has been described27, our finding may allow the establishment 
276 
of an animal model for studying H. pylori infection that better replicates the prevailing 
277 
virulence pathways.

Discussion 
280 
The here identified CEACAM-binding property provides H. pylori a means of 
281 
epithelial adherence in addition to the Lewis antigens used by the BabA and SabA 
282 
adhesins5,6,17. While over-expression of CEACAMs in gastrointestinal tumors is well 
283 
described, their up-regulation during H. pylori-induced inflammation in the stomach has not 
284 
been reported so far, suggesting the pathogen has the ability to shape its own adhesive niche. 
285 
A similar phenomenon has also been observed for the inflammation-induced up-regulation of 
286 
sialylated antigens that form the receptors for the SabA adhesin6. A plausible route to 
287 
CEACAM modulation is through the transcription factors NF-κB and AP1, both of which are 
288 
induced during H. pylori infection28 and are known to regulate CEACAM expression29. 
289 
Though HopQ-dependent adherence may appear redundant to that of other adhesins like 
290 
BabA, SabA or LabA, HopQ specializes on human CEACAMs and is required for cagPAI 
291 
functionality. From the perspective of host-pathogen (i.e. human-H. pylori) co-evolution, the 
292 
primary function of HopQ may lie in immune-modulation through CEACAM binding, and 
293 
HopQ’s indirect effects on other virulence cascades elicited by H. pylori such as that induced 
294 
by increased CagA delivery may not have been initially “intended“. The cagPAI was acquired 
295 
by ancestral H. pylori in a single event that occurred before modern humans migrated out of 
296 
East Africa around 58,000 years ago30. Thus, it is likely that the employment of CEACAM1 
297 
ligation by H. pylori occurred much earlier to support colonization and to modulate immune 
298 
responses. This assumption is supported by the fact that all fully sequenced H. pylori strains 
299 
bear hopQ (Extended Data Fig.3d), indicating that this is an essential outer membrane protein 
300 
of H. pylori. Upon occurrence of type-I H. pylori strains by cagPAI acquisition more than 
301 
60,000 years ago30 this ancient survival strategy was further implemented into a mechanism 
302 
supporting pathogenicity, and thus may have contributed to the switch from commensal to 
303 
pathogenic H. pylori31. Pathogenicity might even be further aggravated by our observation 
304 
that CEACAMs are strongly up-regulated during gastritis, which further potentiates binding 
305 
of H. pylori to epithelial cells and specifically facilitates CagA/cagPAI interaction with the 
306 
host cells.   
307 
Taken together, the finding that H. pylori employs CEACAMs not only for bacterial 
308 
adherence but also to induce cellular signaling may lead to a better understanding of the 
309 
pathogenic mechanisms of these bacteria and might lead to novel therapeutic approaches to 
310 
more effectively combat this highly prevalent infection and the associated gastric pathology.

316 
Bacteria and bacterial growth conditions 
317 
The H. pylori strains G2732, PMSS133, SS134, J99 (ATCC, 700824), 280835, 26695 (ATCC, 
318 
70039), TX3036, 6019037, P1238, NCTC11637 (ATCC, 43504), Ka89 and H. bilis 
319 
(ATCC43879) were grown on Wilkins–Chalgren blood agar plates under microaerobic 
320 
conditions (10% CO2, 5% O2, 8.5% N2, and 37°C). H. suis39 and H. heilmannii40 were grown 
321 
on Brucella agar and H. felis (ATCC 49179) and H. bizzozeronii41 on brain-heart infusion 
322 
(BHI) agar supplemented with 10% horse blood. Moraxella catarrhalis (ATCC, 25238) 
323 
provided by C. R. Hauck (Konstanz Research School Chemical Biology, University of 
324 
Konstanz, Germany), Moraxella Lacunata (ATCC 17967) and Campylobacter jejuni (ATCC, 
325 
33560) were cultured on brain–heart infusion (BHI) agar supplemented with 5% heated horse 
326 
blood overnight at 37°C in a CO2 incubator. The generation of an isogenic ΔhopQ mutant has 
327 
been done by replacement of the entire gene by a chloramphenicol resistance cassette. For 
328 
genetic complementation of hopQ, the 1,926 bp gene fragment of H. pylori strain P12 was 
329 
amplified by PCR. This fragment was cloned into the complementation vector pSB1001 using 
330 
the AphA3 cassette for selection. This fusion construct was introduced in the plasticity region 
331 
of strain P12ΔhopQ (between ORFs HP0999 and HP1000) using a strategy as described42. 
332 
Production of CEACAM proteins 
333 
The cDNA, which encodes the extracellular domains of human CEACAM1-Fc (consisting of 
334 
N-A1-B1-A2 domains), human CEACAM1dN-Fc (consisting of A1-B1-A2, lacking the first 
335 
143 amino acids of the N-terminal IgV-like domain), rat CEACAM1-Fc (consisting of N-A1-
336 
B1-A2), rat CEACAM1dN-Fc (consisting of A1-B1-A2), human CEACAM3-Fc (consisting 
337 
of N), human CEACAM6-Fc (consisting of N-A-B), human CEACAM8-Fc (consisting of N-
338 
A-B), respectively, were fused to a human heavy chain Fc-domain and cloned into the 
339 
pcDNA3.1(+) expression vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA), sequenced and stably 
340 
transfected into HEK293 (ATCC CRL-1573)cells as described43. The Fc chimeric CEACAM-
341 
Fc proteins were accumulated in serum-free Pro293s-CDM medium (Lonza) and were 
342 
recovered by Protein A/G-Sepharose affinity Chromatography (Pierce). Proteins were 
343 
analyzed by SDS-PAGE and stained by Coomassie blue demonstrating an equal amount and 
344 
integrity of the produced fusion proteins (Extended Data Fig. 1i). Recombinant-human 
345 
CEACAM5-Fc was ordered from Sino Biological Inc. The GFP-tagged CEACAMs (human-
346 
CEACAM1 and its variants, mouse-CEACAM1, bovine-CEACAM1 and canine-CEACAM1) 
347 
 12 
 
were provided by Dr. C. R. Hauck (University Konstanz, Germany). For production of the 
348 
recombinant human CEACAM1 N-Domain (C1ND), the annotated domain (residues 35-142 
349 
of CEACAM1, Uniprot ID: P13688) was first backtranslated using the Gene 
350 
Optimizer® (LifeTechnologies) and the leader sequence of the Igk-chain as well as a C-
351 
terminal Strep-Tag II was added. The gene was synthesized and seamlessly cloned into 
352 
pCDNA3.4-TOPO (LifeTechnologies). Protein was produced in a 2 L culture of Expi293 
353 
cells according to the Expi293 expression system instructions (LifeTechnologies). 
354 
The resulting supernatant was concentrated and diafiltered against ten volumes of 1x 
355 
SAC buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl, 140 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0) by crossflow-
356 
filtration, using a Hydrosart 5 kDa molecular-weight cutoff membrane (Sartorius). The 
357 
retentate was loaded onto a StrepTrap HP column (GE Healthcare) and eluted with 1x SAC 
358 
supplemented with 2.5 mM D-Desthiobiotin (IBA). The protein was stored at +4°C.  
359 
For the bacterial expression of the C1ND (Ec-C1ND) the amino acid sequence (residues 35-
360 
142 of CEACAM1, Uniprot ID: P13688) was codon optimized for expression in E. coli, 
361 
synthesized by GeneArt de novo gene synthesis (Life Technologies), and cloned with a C-
362 
terminal His6 tag in the pDESTTM14 vector using Gateway technology (Invitrogen). E. coli 
363 
C43(DE3) cells were transformed with the resulting construct and grown in LB supplemented 
364 
with 100 µg/mL ampicillin at 37°C while shaking. At OD600=1 Ec-C1ND expression was 
365 
induced with 1 mM IPTG overnight at 30°C. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 6.238 g 
366 
for 15 minutes at 4°C and resuspended in 50mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 500 mM NaCl (4 mL/g wet 
367 
cells) supplemented with 5 µM leupeptin and 1 mM AEBSF, 100 µg/mL lysozyme, and 20 
368 
µg/mL DNase I. Subsequently cells were lysed by a single passage in a Constant System Cell 
369 
Cracker at 20 kPsi at 4 °C and debris was removed by centrifugation at 48.400 g for 40 
370 
minutes. The cytoplasmic extract was filtrated through a 0.45 µm pore filter and loaded on a 5 
371 
mL pre-packed Ni-NTA column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with buffer A (50 mM Tris-
372 
HCl pH 7.4, 500 mM NaCl and 20 mM imidazole). The column was then washed with 40 bed 
373 
volumes of buffer A and bound proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 0-75 % buffer B 
374 
(50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 500 mM NaCl and 500 mM imidazole). Fractions containing Ec-
375 
C1ND, as determined by SDS-PAGE, were pooled and concentrated in a 10 kDa MW cutoff 
376 
spin concentrator to a final volume of 5 ml. To remove minor protein contaminants, the 
377 
concentrated sample was injected onto the Hi-Prep™ 26/60 Sephacryl S-100 HR column (GE 
378 
Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with a buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl. 
379 
Fractions containing the Ec-C1ND complex were pooled and concentrated using a 10 kDa 
380 
MW cutoff spin concentrator.

383 
HopQAD and HopQADΔID cloning, production and purification 
384 
In order to obtain a soluble HopQ fragment, the HopQ gene from the H. pylori G27 strain 
385 
(accession No. CP001173 Region: 1228696..1230621) HopQ fragment ranging from residues 
386 
37 – 463 was produced (residues 17-444 of the mature protein), thus removing the N-terminal 
387 
β-strand and signal peptide, as well as the C-terminal β-domain expected to represent the TM 
388 
domain. In HopQADΔID, the amino acids 184-212 of the mature protein were replaced by two 
389 
glycines (Extended Data Fig.f). DNA coding sequences corresponding to the HopQ type I 
390 
fragments was PCR-amplified from H. pylori G27 genomic DNA using primers (forward: 
391 
GTTTAACTTTAAGAAGGAGATATACAAATGGCGGTTCAAAAAGTGAAAAACGC; 
392 
reverse: TCAAGCTTATTAATGATGATGATGATGGTGGGCGCCGTTATTCGTGGTTG), 
393 
containing 30bp overlap to the flanking target vector sequences of pPRkana-1, a derivative of 
394 
pPR-IBA 1 (IBA GmbH) with the ampicillin resistance cassette replaced by the kanamycin 
395 
resistance cassette, under a T7 promotor. In parallel, the vector was PCR-amplified using 
396 
primers (forward: CACCATCATCATCATCATTAATAAGCTTGATCCGGCTGCTAAC ; 
397 
reverse: GTTTAACTTTAAGAAGGAGATATACAAATG) as provided in table 1, using the 
398 
same overlapping sequences in reversed orientation. The forward primer additionally carried 
399 
the sequence for a 6x His-tag. The amplicons were seamlessly cloned using Gibson Assembly 
400 
(New England Biolabs GmbH). Based on codon optimized HopQAD plasmid, the HopQADΔID 
401 
constructs were cloned. The plasmids were amplified by 5’ phosphorylated primers (forward: 
402 
GGTGACGCTCAGAACCTGCTGAC; 
reverse: 
ACCACCTTTAGAGTTCAGCGGAG) 
403 
replacing the ID region by two glycines, DpnI (NEB) digested and blunt-end ligated by T4 
404 
ligase (NEB). 
405 
Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells (NEB GmbH) were transformed with the pPRkana-1 
406 
constructs, grown at 37°C with 275 rpm on auto-inducing terrific broth (TRB) according to 
407 
Studier44, supplemented with 2 mM MgSO4, 100 mg/L Kanamycin-Sulfate (Carl Roth GmbH 
408 
+ Co. KG), 0.2 g/L PPG2000 (Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.2% w/v Lactose-monohydrate (Sigma-
409 
Aldrich), until an OD of 1-2 was reached. Afterwards, the temperature was lowered to 25°C 
410 
and auto-induced overnight, reaching a final OD of 10-15 the following morning. Cells were 
411 
harvested by centrifugation at 6000 g for 15 min at 4 °C using a SLA-3000 rotor in a Sorvall 
412 
RC-6 Plus centrifuge (Thermo Fischer). Prior to cell disruption, cells were resuspended in 10 
413 
mL cold NiNTA buffer A (500 mM NaCl, 100 mM Tris-HCl, 25 mM Imidazole, pH 7.4) per 
414 
gram of biological wet weight (BWW), supplemented with 0.1 mM AEBSF-HCl, 150 U/g 
415 
 14 
 
BWW DNase I and 5 mM MgCl2and dispersed with an Ultra-Turrax T25 digital (IKA GmbH 
416 
+ Co. KG). Cell disruption was performed by high-pressure homogenization with a 
417 
PANDA2000 (GEA NiroSoavi) at 800-1200 bar in 3 passages at 4 °C. The cell lysate was 
418 
clarified by centrifugation at 25000 g for 30 min at 4 °C in a SLA-1500 rotor and remaining 
419 
particles removed by filtration through a 0.2 µM filter. 
420 
HopQ fragments were purified by consecutive nickel affinity and size exclusion 
421 
chromatography. Briefly, the clarified cell lysate was loaded onto a 5 mL pre-packed Ni-NTA 
422 
HisTrap FF crude column (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with buffer A, washed with ten 
423 
column volumes (CV) of buffer A and the bound protein eluted with a 15 CV linear gradient 
424 
to 75% NiNTA buffer B (500 mM NaCl, 100 mM Tris-HCl, 500 mM Imidazole, pH 7.4). 
425 
Eluted peak fractions were collected, pooled and concentrated to a final concentration of 8-10 
426 
mg ml-1 using a 10 kDa molecular-weight cutoff spin concentrator. Subsequently, 5 mL of the 
427 
concentrated protein were loaded onto a HiLoad 16/600 Superdex 75 pg column (GE 
428 
Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with Buffer C (5 mM Tris-HCl, 140 mM NaCl, pH 7.3) and 
429 
eluted at 1 mL/min. Finally, only protein corresponding to the monomer-peak was pooled and 
430 
stored at +4 °C prior to crystallization. For analyzing the multimerization state of HopQAD, 
431 
SEC was performed on a Superdex 200 10/300 GL (GE Healthcare) with 24 mL bed volume. 
432 
The column was pre-equilibrated with Buffer C and subsequently, 25 µg protein injected and 
433 
separated with a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min. 
434 
The HopQ interaction domain (HopQ-ID) representing peptide was HA-tagged, synthesized 
435 
(EKLEAHVTTSKYQQDNQTKTTTSVIDTTNYPYDVPDYA) and HPLC purified (Peptide 
436 
Specialty Laboratories, Heidelberg, Germany). For cellular assays, the lyophilized peptide 
437 
was dissolved in sterile PBS to a concentration of 1 mM and dialysed with a 0.1-0.5 kDa 
438 
molecular-weight cutoff membrane against PBS to remove remaining TFA. The peptide 
439 
solution was stored at -20 °C until further use. 
440 
Detection of the HopQ-CEACAM interaction by ELISA 
441 
For detection of the interaction between CEACAM and HopQAD, recombinant C1ND (1 
442 
µg/mL) in PBS was coated over night at 4 °C onto a 96-well immunoplate (Nunc MaxiSorb). 
443 
Wells were blocked with SmartBlock (Candor) for 2 h at RT. Subsequently, HopQ fragments 
444 
were added in a fivefold series dilution ranging from 10 µg/mL to 0.05 ng/mL for 2h at room 
445 
temperature. Next, anα-6xHis-HRP conjugate (clone 3D5, LifeTechnologies) was diluted 
446 
1:5000 and incubated for 1h at room temperature. For detection, 1-Step™ Ultra TMB-ELISA 
447 
Substrate Solution (LifeTechnologies) was used and the enzymatic reaction was stopped with 
448 
 15 
 
2 N H2SO4. Washing (3-5x) in between incubation steps was carried out with PBS / 0.05% 
449 
Tween20.  
450 
Isothermal titration calorimetry 
451 
ITC measurements were performed on a MicroCal iTC200 calorimeter (Malvern). 25 µM 
452 
C1ND or EcC1ND were loaded into the cell of the calorimeter and 250 µM HopQAD type I 
453 
was loaded in the syringe. All measurements were done at 25°C, with a stirring speed of 600 
454 
rpm and performed in 20 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol and 
455 
0.05% (v/v) Tween-20. Binding data were analyzed using the MicroCal LLC ITC200 
456 
software. 
457 
SDS-PAGE and native-PAGE for Western blot 
458 
CEACAM was separated with both SDS-PAGE and native-PAGE (resp. on 15% and 7.5% 
459 
polyacrylamide gels) in ice-cold 25 mM Tris-HCl, 250 mM glycine buffer. Subsequently 
460 
samples were transferred to PVDF-membranes by wet blotting at 25 V during 60 minutes in 
461 
ice-cold transfer buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl, 250 mM glycine and 20% methanol). Membranes 
462 
were blocked during one hour in 10% milk powder (MP), 1x PBS and 0.005% Tween-20. 
463 
Both membranes were washed and incubated together in 5% MP, 1x PBS, 0.005% Tween-20 
464 
in presence of 2 µM HopQAD type I for one hour to allow complex formation between 
465 
HopQAD I and CEACAM. After a washing step the C-terminal His-tag of HopQ (CEACAM is 
466 
strep tagged) was detected by adding consecutively mouse α-His (AbDSerotec) and goat α-
467 
mouse antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) during respectively one hour and 30 minutes in 5% MP, 1x 
468 
PBS, 0.005% Tween-20. After a washing step the blot was developed by adding BCIP/NBT 
469 
substrate 
(5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate/nitro 
blue 
tetrazolium) 
(Roche) 
in 
470 
developing buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 9.5, 100 mM NaCl, 50 mM MgCl2). 
471 
Bacterial pull down 
472 
Bacteria were grown overnight on WC dent agar plates. Bacteria were scraped from plates, 
473 
suspended in PBS, and colony forming units (cfu) were estimated by optical density 600 
474 
readings according to a standard curve. Bacteria were washed twice with PBS and 
475 
2 × 108 cells/mL were incubated with soluble CEACAM-Fc or CEACAM-GFP proteins or 
476 
CHO cell lysates for 1 h at 37 °C with head-over-head rotation. After incubation, bacteria 
477 
were washed 5 times with PBS and either boiled in SDS sample buffer (62.5 mM Tris-HCl 
478 
[pH 6.8], 2% w/v SDS, 10% glycerol, 50 mM DTT, and 0.01% w/v bromophenol blue) prior 
479 
to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting or taken up in FACS buffer (PBS/0.5% BSA) for flow 
480 
cytometry analysis.  
481 
 16 
 
Immunoprecipitation and Mass Spectrometry 
482 
Bacteria (2x108) in cold PBS containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Roche) were 
483 
lysed by ultra-sonication on ice (10x, 20s). Cell debris was removed from the lysates by 
484 
centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C, followed by pre-clearing with prewashed 
485 
protein G-agarose (Roche Diagnostics).  CEACAM1-Fc was added to the lysate (10 µg) and 
486 
incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. Prewashed protein G-agarose (60 μL) were added to the antibody 
487 
and lysate mixture and incubated 2 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed with PBS for five times to 
488 
remove unspecifically bound proteins. Two-thirds of the beads were separated and used for 
489 
mass spectrometry sample preparation. The supernatant was removed and the beads were 
490 
resuspended twice in 50 µL 7M urea/ 2 M thiourea solved in 20 mM Hepes (pH 7.5) for 
491 
denaturation of the proteins. Beads were pelleted by centrifugation and supernatants pooled 
492 
and transferred to a new Eppendorf tube. Subsequently, proteins were reduced in 1 mM DTT 
493 
for 45 min and alkylated at a final concentration of 5.5 mM iodacetamide for 30 min in the 
494 
dark. The alkylation step was quenched by raising the DTT concentration to 5 mM for 30 
495 
min. All incubation steps were carried out at RT under vigorous shaking (Eppendorf shaker, 
496 
450 rpm). For digestion of the proteins 1 µL LysC (0.5 µg/µL) was added and the sample 
497 
incubated for 4h at RT. To reduce the urea concentration the sample was diluted 1:4 with 50 
498 
mM triethylammonium bicarbonate and then incubated with 1.5 µL trypsin (0.5 µg/µL) at 37 
499 
°C over night. Trypsin was finally inactivated by acidification with formic acid. The 
500 
supernatant was transferred to a new Eppendorf tube and pooled with the following wash 
501 
fraction of the beads with 0.1% formic acid. The sample was adjusted to pH 3 with formic 
502 
acid (100% v/v) and subjected to peptide desalting with a SepPak C18 column (50 mg, 
503 
Waters). Briefly, the column was subsequently washed with 1 mL 100% acetonitrile and 500 
504 
µL 80% acetonitrile, 0.5% formic acid. The column was equilibrated with 1 mL 0.1% TFA, 
505 
the sample was loaded and the column washed again with 1 mL 0.1% TFA. After an 
506 
additional wash step with 500 µL 0.5% formic acid peptides were eluted twice with 250 µL 
507 
80% acetonitrile, 0.5% formic acid. The organic phase was then removed by vacuum 
508 
centrifugation and peptides stored at -80 °C. Directly before measurement peptides were 
509 
resolved in 20 µL 0.1% formic acid, sonified for 5 min (water bath) and the sample afterwards 
510 
filtered with a prewashed and equilibrated filter (0.45 µm low protein binding filter, VWR 
511 
International, LLC). Measurements were performed on an LC-MS system consisting of an 
512 
Ultimate 3000 nano HPLC directly linked to an Orbitrap XL instrument (Thermo Scientific). 
513 
Samples were loaded onto a trap column (2 µm, 100 A, 2 cm length) and separated on a 15 
514 
cm C18 column (2 µm, 100 A, Thermo Scientific) during a 150 min gradient ranging from 5 
515 
 17 
 
to 30% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid. Survey spectra were acquired in the orbitrap with a 
516 
resolution of 60,000 at m/z 400. For protein identification up to five of the most intense ions 
517 
of the full scan were sequentially isolated and fragmented by collision induced dissociation. 
518 
The received data was analyzed with the Proteome Discoverer Software version 1.4 (Thermo 
519 
Scientific) and searched against the H. pylori (strain G27) database (1501 proteins) in the 
520 
SEQUEST algorithm. Protein N-terminal acetylation and oxidation of methionins were added 
521 
as variable modifications, carbamidomethylation on cysteines as static modifications. Enzyme 
522 
specificity was set to trypsin and mass tolerances of the precursor and fragment ions were set 
523 
to 10 ppm and 0.8 Da, respectively. Only peptides that fulfilled Xcorr values of 1.5, 2.0, 2.25 
524 
and 2.5 for charge states +1, +2, +3 and +4 respectively were considered for data analysis. 
525 
Cells, cell-bacteria co-culture and elongation phenotype quantitation assay 
526 
Gastric cancer cell lines MKN4545, KatoIII (ATCC, HTB-103), MKN28 46 and AGS (ATCC, 
527 
CRL-1739) were obtained from ATCC and DSMZ, authenticated by utilizing Short Tandem 
528 
Repeat (STR) profiling, cultured either sparse or to tight confluence in DMEM (GIBCO, 
529 
Invitrogen, Carlsbad CA, USA) containing 2 mM L-glutamine (GIBCO, Invitrogen, CA, 
530 
USA) supplemented with 10% FBS (GIBCO, Invitrogen, CA, USA) and 1% Penicillin/ 
531 
Streptomycin (GIBCO, Invitrogen, CA, USA). All cell lines were maintained in an incubator 
532 
at 37°C with 5% CO2 and 100% humidity, and were routinely mycoplasma-tested twice per 
533 
year by DAPI stain and PCR. Plate-grown bacteria were suspended in DMEM and washed by 
534 
centrifugation at 150 g for 5 min in a microcentrifuge. After resuspension in DMEM, the 
535 
optical density at 600 nm was determined and bacteria were added to the overnight serum-
536 
deprived cells at different ratios of bacteria/cell (MOI) at 37°C to start the infection. After the 
537 
indicated time, cells were washed twice with PBS and then lysed with 1% NP-40 in protease 
538 
& phosphatase inhibitor PBS. HEK293 cells were chosen for CEACAM transfection studies 
539 
because the cells were found to be negative for hu-CEACAM expression, and are easily 
540 
transfectable. HEK cells were grown in 6-well plates containing RPMI 1640 medium 
541 
(Invitrogen) supplemented with 25 mM HEPES buffer and 10% heat-inactivated FBS 
542 
(Biochrom, Berlin, Germany) for 2 days to approximately 70% confluence. Cells were serum-
543 
deprived overnight and infected with H. pylori at MOI 50 for the indicated time points in each 
544 
figure. After infection, the cells were harvested in ice-cold PBS containing 1 mM Na3VO4 
545 
(Sigma-Aldrich). Elongated AGS cells in each experiment were quantified in 5 different 0.25-
546 
mm2 fields using an Olympus IX50 phase contrast microscope.  
547

Transfection 
548 
A CHO cell line (ATCC) permanently expressing hu-CEACAM1-4L, mouse-CEACAM1-L 
549 
and rat-CEACAM1-L were generated by stably transfecting cells with 4 µg pcDNA3.1-
550 
huCEACAM1-4L, pcDNA3.1-huCEACAM1-4S, pcDNA3.1-msCEACAM1-L, pcDNA3.1-
551 
ratCEACAM1-L plasmid (Singer), respectively, utilizing the lipofectamine 2000 procedure 
552 
according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). Stable transfected cells were selected in 
553 
culture medium containing 1 mg/mL of Geniticinsulfat (G418, Biochrom, Berlin, Germany). 
554 
The surface expression of CEACAM1 in individual clones growing in log phase was 
555 
determined by flow cytometry (FACS calibur, BD). HEK293 cells were transfected with 4 μg 
556 
of the HA-tagged CEACAM constructs or luciferase reporter constructs (Clontech, Germany) 
557 
for 48 h with TurboFect reagent (Fermentas, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s 
558 
instructions. 
559 
Western blot 
560 
An equal volume of cell lysate was loaded on 8% SDS-PAGE gels and after electrophoresis, 
561 
separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Whatman/GE Healthcare, 
562 
Freiburg, Germany). Membranes were blocked in 5% non-fat milk for 1 h at room 
563 
temperature and incubated overnight with primary antibodies mAb 18/20 binding to 
564 
CEACAM1,3,5, B3-17 and C5-1X (mono-specific for hu-CEACAM1, Singer), 4/3/17 
565 
(binding to CEACAM1,5, Genovac), and 5C8C4 (mono-specific for hu-CEACAM5, Singer), 
566 
1H7-4B (mono-specific for hu-CEACAM6, Singer), 6/40c (mono-specific for hu-CEACAM8, 
567 
Singer), Be9.2 (α-rat-CEACAM1, kindly provided by Dr. W. Reutter, Charite, CBF, 
568 
Germany), mAb 11-1H (α-rat-CEACAM1ΔN, Singer), phosphotyrosine antibody PY-99 
569 
(Santa Cruz, LaJolla, CA, USA), α-CagAphosphotyrosine antibody PY-972 47, mouse 
570 
monoclonal α-CagA antibody (Austral Biologicals, San Ramon, CA, USA), mouse 
571 
monoclonal α-CEACAM1 (clone D14HD11Genovac/Aldevron, Freiburg,Germany) or goat 
572 
α-GAPDH (Santa Cruz). After washing, membranes were incubated with the secondary 
573 
antibody [HRP-conjugated α-mouse IgG (Promega)] and proteins were detected by ECL 
574 
Western Blotting Detection reagents. The quantification was done by LabImage 1D software 
575 
(INTAS). 
576 
Flow cytometry 
577 
The Fc-tagged CEACAMs (2.5 µg/mL) were incubated with H. pylori (OD600=1) and 
578 
subsequently with FITC-conjugated goat α-human IgG (Sigma-Aldrich). After washing with 
579 
 19 
 
FACS buffer, the samples were analyzed by gating on the bacteria (based on forward and 
580 
sideward scatter) and measuring bacteria-associated fluorescence. In each case, 10,000 events 
581 
per sample were obtained. Analysis was performed with the FACS CyAn (Beckman Coulter) 
582 
and the data were evaluated with FlowJo software (Treestar). For the analysis of CEACAM 
583 
mediated HopQ binding, indicated cell types (5×105 in 50 µL) were incubated with 20 µg/mL 
584 
of H. pylori strain P12 derived,myc and 6x His-tagged recombinant HopQdiluted in 3% 
585 
FCS/PBS for 1 h on ice. After three times washing with 3% FCS/PBS samples were labeled 
586 
with 20 µg/mL of mouse α-c-mycmAb (clone 9E10, AbDSerotec) and subsequently with 
587 
FITC conjugated goat α-mouse F(ab')2 (Dianova, Germany). In parallel, the presence of 
588 
CEACAMs was controlled by staining cells utilizing the rabbit anti CEA pAb (A0115, 
589 
Dianova) followed by FITC conjugated goat α-rabbit F(ab')2 (Dianova, Germany). 
590 
Background fluorescence was determined using isotype-matched Ig mAb. The stained cell 
591 
samples were examined in a FACScalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA) 
592 
and the data were analyzed utilizing the CellQuest software. Dead cells, identified by PI 
593 
staining, were excluded from the measurement. 
594 
Immunohistochemistry and Immunofluorescence 
595 
Following approval of the local ethics committee, paraffin-embedded human normal stomach, 
596 
gastritis and cancer samples were randomly chosen from the tissue bank of the Institut für 
597 
Pathologie, Klinikum Bayreuth Germany. Histological samples were excluded if tissue 
598 
quality was poor. After antigen retrieval with 10 mM sodium citrate buffer pH 6 in pressure 
599 
cooker, the sections were incubated with α-hu-CEACAM1, 5, 6 and α-rat-CEACAM1 
600 
antibodies (clone B3-17, 5C8C4, 1H7-4B and Be9.2, respectively). Sections were developed 
601 
with SignalStain DAB (Cell Signaling) following manufacturer’s instructions. Sections were 
602 
counterstained with hematoxylin (Morphisto). The automated image acquisition was 
603 
performed with Olympus Virtual Slide System VS120 (Olympus, Hamburg, Germany).  
604 
Visualization of the co-localization of HopQ and CEACAMs co-staining of normal and 
605 
gastritis sections was performed utilizing HopQ-biotin followed by streptavidin-Cy3 and α-
606 
hu-CEACAM1, 3, 5, 6, 8 clone 6G5j followed by Alexa 488 coupled goat anti mouse 
607 
antibody. The cell nuclei were stained with DAPI. DAPI and fluorescent proteins were 
608 
analyzed with the Leica DMI4000B microscope. 
609 
Adherence assay 
610 
The adherence assay was performed according to Hytonen et al 48. Briefly, human gastric 
611 
epithelial cells (MKN45 and AGS) and CEACAM1-transfected CHO cells were grown in 
612 
 20 
 
antibiotic free DMEM (Gibco, Gaithersburg, MD) supplemented with 5% FCS and L-
613 
glutamine (2 mM, Sigma-Aldrich) on tissue culture 96 well plates (Bioscience) in 5% CO2 
614 
atmosphere for 2 days. To visualize H. pylori cells in adhesion assays, OD600=1 of bacteria 
615 
were fluorescence labeled with CFDA-SE (Molecular Probes) and washed with PBS. CFDA-
616 
SE was added at concentration of 10 µM for 30 min at 37˚C under constant rotation in the 
617 
dark. Excess dye was removed by 3 times washing with PBS. Bacteria were resuspended in 
618 
PBS until further use. Labelled bacteria were co-incubated (MOI 10) with the cells at 37°C 
619 
with gentle agitation for 1 h. After washing with PBS (1 mL, ×3) to remove non-adherent 
620 
bacteria, cells were fixed in paraformaldehyde (2%, 10 min). Bacterial binding was 
621 
determined by measuring the percentage of cells that bound fluorescent-labeled bacteria using 
622 
flow cytometry analysis. 
623 
IL-8 cytokine ELISA 
624 
AGS cell line was infected with H. pylori as described already and PBS-incubated control 
625 
cells served as negative control. The culture supernatants were collected and stored at -20 °C 
626 
until assayed. IL-8 concentration in the supernatant was determined by standard ELISA with 
627 
commercially available assay kits (Becton Dickinson, Germany) according to described 
628 
procedures.  
629 
 
630 
HopQ-dependency of CagA virulence pathways 
631 
If not indicated otherwise, the AGS cell line (ATCC CRL-1730) was infected with the various 
632 
H. pylori strains for 6 hours at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 50. The cells were then 
633 
harvested in ice-cold PBS in the presence of 1 mM Na3VO4 (Sigma-Aldrich). In each 
634 
experiment the number of elongated AGS cells was quantified in 10 different 0.25-mm2 fields 
635 
using a phase contrast microscope (Olympus IX50). CagA translocation was determined using 
636 
the indicated antibodies detecting Tyr-phosphorylated CagA. All experiments were performed 
637 
in triplicates. For inhibition experiments, cells were incubated with the indicated antibodies or 
638 
peptides prior to infection.  
639 
Confocal microscopy 
640 
CHO cells were grown on chamber slides (Thermo Scientific), fixed in paraformaldehyde 
641 
(4%, 10 min) and blocked with PBS/5% bovine serum albumin. CFDA-SE labelled bacteria 
642 
(10 µM for 30 min at 37˚C under constant rotation in the dark) at MOI 5 were incubated with 
643 
cells for 1 h at 37˚C under constant rotation. After 5X PBS washing, cell membranes were 
644 
 21 
 
stained with Deep Red (Life Technology) and cell nuclei with DAPI (Life Technology). 
645 
Confocal images of cells were taken using a Leica SP5 confocal microscope.  
646 
Crystallization and structure determination of HopQAD  
647 
HopQADwas concentrated to 40 mg/mL and crystallized by sitting drop vapor diffusion at 
648 
20°C using 0.12 M alcohols (0.02 M 1,6-Hexanediol; 0.02 M 1-Butanol; 0.0 2M 1,2-
649 
Propanediol; 0.02 M 2-Propanol; 0.02 M 1,4-Butanediol; 0.02 M 1,3-Propanediol), 0.1 M Tris 
650 
(base)/BICINE pH 8.5, 20% v/v PEG 500 MME; 10 % w/v PEG 20000 as a crystallization 
651 
buffer. Crystals were loop-mounted and flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen. Data were collected at 
652 
100 K at beamline Proxima1 (SOLEIL, Gif-sur-Yvette, France) and were indexed, processed 
653 
and scaled using the XDS package49. All crystals were in the P21 space group with 
654 
approximate unit cell dimensions of a=57.7 Å, b=57.7 Å, c=285.7 Å and beta=90.1° and four 
655 
copies of HopQ442 per assymetric unit. Phases were obtained by molecular replacement using 
656 
the BabA structure (PDB:5F7K)21 and the program phaser50,51. The models were refined by 
657 
iterative cycles of manual rebuilding in the graphics program COOT52 and maximum 
658 
likelihood refinement using Refmac5 53. Extended Data Table 2 summarizes the crystal 
659 
parameters, data processing and structure refinement statistics. 
660 
Amino acid sequence alignment 
661 
The amino acid sequence alignment of the N-terminal domains of human, mouse and rat-
662 
CEACAM1 and human CEACAMs (1, 5, 6 and 8) was performed using CLC main 
663 
Workbench (CLC bio). 
664 
Luciferase reporter assays 
665 
CHO-CEACAM1-L cells transfected with various luciferase reporter and control constructs 
666 
(Clontech) were infected with H. pylori for 5 h and analyzed by luciferase assay using the 
667 
Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System according to the manufactures instruction (Promega, 
668 
USA). Briefly, cells were harvested by passive lysis, the protein concentration was measured 
669 
with Precision Red (Cytoskeleton, USA) and the lysates were equalized by adding passive 
670 
lysis buffer. The luciferase activity was measured by using a Plate Luminometer (MITHRAS 
671 
LB940 from Berthold, Germany). 
672 
Animal experiments 
673 
Specific pathogen free, 120-150 g 4 weeks-old male Sprague Dawley rats, were obtained from 
674 
Charles River Laboratories (Sulzfeld, Germany). Animals were randomly distributed into the 
675 
different experimental groups by animal care takers not involved in the experiments, and 
676 
 22 
 
criteria for the exclusion of animals were pre-established. Investigator blinding was 
677 
performed for all assessment of outcome and data, histology was performed by an 
678 
independent investigator in a blinded manner. Animals were challenged twice intragastrically 
679 
in groups of 8 with ~1 x 108 live H. pylori in 2 interval days. After 6 weeks infection, 
680 
stomachs were removed and sectioned. One part was embedded in paraffin for histological 
681 
analysis and another piece was weighted and homogenized to determine colony forming units 
682 
(CFU)/mg stomach. Serial dilutions (1/10, 1/100 and 1/1000) were plated in WC dent plates. 
683 
CFU were counted after 4 days.  
 
684 
The experiments were performed in the specific pathogen-free unit of Zentrum für 
685 
Präklinische Forschung, Klinikum r. d. Isar der TU München, according to the allowance and 
686 
guidelines of the ethical committee and state veterinary office (Regierung von Oberbayern, 
687 
55.2-1.54-2532-160-12). 
688 
Statistical Analysis 
689 
For in vitro experiments, normal distribution was determined by Shapiro–Wilk test. Normally 
690 
distributed data were analyzed with two-tailed Student t-test or One-way ANOVA with post 
691 
hoc Bonferroni test (comparing more than two groups) using Graph Pad Prism Software. Data 
692 
are shown as mean ± s.e.m or S.D. for at least three independent experiments. P values <0.05 
693 
were considered significant. For animal studies, power calculation was performed based on 
694 
previous animal experiments to achieve two sided significance of 0,05 while using lowest 
695 
possible numbers to comply with the ethical guidelines for experimental animals. Mann-
696 
Whitney U test or ANOVA Kruskal-Wallis, Dunn’s multiple comparison test were used to 
697 
determine statistical significances.

Summary: Helicobacter pylori specifically colonizes the human gastric epithelium and is the 
38 
major causative agent for ulcer disease and gastric cancer development. Here we identified 
39 
members of the carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule (CEACAM) family 
40 
as novel receptors of H. pylori and show that HopQ is the surface-exposed adhesin that 
41 
specifically binds human CEACAM1, CEACAM3, CEACAM5 and CEACAM6. HopQ - 
42 
CEACAM binding is glycan-independent and targeted to the N-domain. H. pylori binding 
43 
induces CEACAM1 mediated signaling, and the HopQ-CEACAM1 interaction enables 
44 
translocation of the virulence factor CagA into host cells, and enhances the release of pro-
45 
inflammatory mediators such as interleukin-8. Based on the crystal structure of HopQ, we 
46 
found that a β-hairpin insertion (HopQ-ID) in HopQ’s extracellular 3+4 helix bundle domain 
47 
is important for CEACAM binding. A peptide derived from this domain competitively 
48 
inhibits HopQ-mediated activation of the Cag virulence pathway, as genetic or antibody-
49 
mediated abrogation of the HopQ function shows. Together, our data imply the HopQ-
50 
CEACAM1 interaction as potentially promising novel therapeutic target to combat H. pylori-
51 
associated diseases.  
52

Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is one of the most prevalent human pathogens, 
54 
colonizing half of the world’s population. Chronic inflammation elicited by this bacterium is 
55 
the main cause of gastric cancer1.  During co-evolution with it’s human host over more than 
56 
60.000 years2, the bacterium has acquired numerous adaptations for the long-term survival 
57 
within its unique niche, the stomach. This includes the ability to buffer the extreme acidity of 
58 
this environment, the interference with cellular signaling pathways, the evasion of the human 
59 
immune response and a strong adhesive property to host cells3. Specifically, H. pylori 
60 
persistence is facilitated by the binding of BabA and SabA adhesins to the human blood group 
61 
antigen Leb and the sLex antigen, respectively4-6. However, adhesion to blood group antigens 
62 
is not universal, is dynamically regulated during the course of infection and can also be turned 
63 
off 7. We observed that H. pylori was capable of binding to human gastric epithelium of non-
64 
secretors. Therefore, we hypothesized that the bacterium might be able to interact with other 
65 
cell surface receptors to ensure persistent colonization.  
66 
We here show that the H. pylori adhesin HopQ specifically interacts with human 
67 
carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecules (CEACAMs). CEACAMs embrace 
68 
a group of immunoglobulin superfamily-related glycoproteins with a wide tissue distribution. 
69 
CEACAM1 can be expressed in leukocytes, endothelial and epithelial cells, CEACAM3 and 
70 
CEACAM8 in granulocytes, CEACAM5 and CEACAM7 in epithelial cells and CEACAM6 
71 
in epithelia and granulocytes. In epithelial cells, transmembrane anchored CEACAM1 as well 
72 
as glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked CEACAM5, CEACAM6 and CEACAM7 localize to 
73 
the apical membrane8. CEACAMs modulate diverse cellular functions such as cell adhesion, 
74 
differentiation, proliferation, and cell survival. Some CEACAMs were recognized as valuable 
75 
tumor markers due to their enlarged expression in the malignant tissue and increased sera 
76 
level9. In recent years, CEACAMs have also emerged as immunomodulatory mediators10. 
77 
Interestingly, in humans, several CEACAMs have been found to specifically interact with 
78 
bacteria such as Neisseria, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Escherichia 
79 
coli 11.  
80 
 
81 
H. pylori binds to CEACAMs expressed in human stomach 
82 
Based on the observation that H. pylori efficiently colonizes individuals in the absence of 
83 
Lewis blood group antigens12 on the one hand, and the increased expression of members of 
84 
the carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule family (CEACAMs) in gastric 
85 
tumors, we hypothesized that H. pylori may employ CEACAMs as receptors. Using pull 
86 
down and flow cytometric approaches we found a robust interaction of the H. pylori strain 
87 
 4 
 
G27 with recombinant human CEACAM1-Fc (Fig. 1a), comparable to that of Moraxella 
88 
catarrhalis (Extended Data Fig. 1a and b). As negative control, Moraxella lacunata did not 
89 
bind to human CEACAM1, nor did Campylobacter jejuni, a pathogen closely related to H. 
90 
pylori (Extended Data Fig. 1a and b). When testing for CEACAM specificity, we observed a 
91 
clear interaction of H. pylori also with CEACAM3, 5 and 6, but not with CEACAM8 (Fig.1b 
92 
and Extended Data Fig. 1c and d). Importantly, all H. pylori strains tested bound to these 
93 
CEACAMs (Extended Data Fig.1f and g) including well-characterized reference strains 
94 
(26695, J99) and the mouse-adapted strain SS1. However, binding strength differed among 
95 
strains, with some preferentially binding to CEACAM1, and others to CEACAM5 and/or 
96 
CEACAM6 (Extended Data Fig. 1f and g). We then analyzed the expression profiles of 
97 
CEACAM1, CEACAM5 and CEACAM6 in normal and inflamed human stomach tissues and 
98 
gastric cancer. If at all low levels of CEACAM1 and CEACAM5 were expressed at the apical 
99 
side of epithelial cells, and their expression, as well as that of CEACAM6, was up-regulated 
100 
upon gastritis and in gastric tumors (Fig. 1c and Extended Data Fig. 1e). During infection, H. 
101 
pylori-induced responses may thus lead to increased expression of its CEACAM-receptors.  
102 
Adhesins from other bacteria were shown to specifically bind to the N-domain of human 
103 
CEACAM113,14. Similarly, we found that lack of the CEACAM1 N-domain abolished H. 
104 
pylori binding completely (Fig. 1d). While for the interaction of Neisseria meningitidis with 
105 
CEACAM1 the N-domain was necessary but not sufficient for binding15, we observed binding 
106 
of H. pylori to all tested CEACAM1 isoforms containing the N-domain, as well as to the N-
107 
domain alone (Fig. 1e). However, binding to the N-domain alone was weaker than to the N-
108 
A1-B CEACAM1 variant, which bound less than the N-A1-B-A2 variant (Fig. 1e and 
109 
Extended Data Fig.1j), suggesting that these domains stabilize the CEACAM1-H.pylori 
110 
interaction. Comparison of the respective N-domains indicated several residues conserved in 
111 
CEACAM1, 5, and 6 but not in CEACAM8 (Extended Data Fig. 1h). 
112 
 
113 
Species specificity of Helicobacter – CEACAM interaction 
114 
Although, murine and Mongolian gerbil models are routinely used to study gastric infection 
115 
with H. pylori, the bacterium has been described so far to be naturally transmitted to only 
116 
humans and non-human primates. Although CEACAMs are found in most mammalian 
117 
species, and have a high degree of conservation, we found H. pylori to bind selectively to 
118 
human, but not to mouse, bovine or canine CEACAM1 orthologues (Fig. 2a). However, we 
119 
were surprised to find a strong interaction of H. pylori with rat-CEACAM1 (Fig. 2b and d). 
120 
This interaction was also mediated through the N-domain of rat-CEACAM1 (Fig. 2c and d). 
121 
 5 
 
To substantiate these findings, we transfected human, mouse or rat-CEACAM1 into CHO 
122 
cells, to which H. pylori does not adhere otherwise. Using confocal laser scanning 
123 
microscopy, we observed de novo adhesion of H. pylori to CHO cells expressing human and 
124 
rat, but not mouse CEACAM1 (Fig. 2e), which could be confirmed by pull down and Western 
125 
blotting of lysates from transfected cells (Fig. 2f and Extended Data Fig. 2d). This finding 
126 
makes H. pylori the first pathogen for which its CEACAM binding is not restricted to one 
127 
species. Comparing the protein sequences of the CEACAM1-N domains, several amino acids 
128 
conserved in human and rat differ in mouse (i.e. asn10, glu26, asn42, tyr48, pro59, thr66, 
129 
asn77, val79, val89, ile90, glu103, tyr108) (Extended Data Fig. 2a). In addition, our findings 
130 
of the lack of binding to mouse CEACAM1 may explain the differences seen in pathology 
131 
between infected mice and humans16. 
132 
The genus Helicobacter comprises several other spp. i.e. H. felis, suis, and bizzozeronii as 
133 
well as the human pathogenic H. bilis and H. heilmannii. When assessing the interaction of 
134 
these Helicobacters with human CEACAMs, only H. bilis bound to human CEACAM1, 5 and 
135 
6 (Extended Data Fig.2b and c). As H. pylori, H. bilis interacted with the N-domain of hu-
136 
CEACAM1 (Extended Data Fig.2b and c). This interaction may explain how H. bilis manages 
137 
to colonize human bile ducts, where high levels of constitutively expressed CEACAM1 are 
138 
present. 
139 
 
140 
HopQ is the Helicobacter adhesin interacting with CEACAMs 
141 
In order to identify the CEACAM-binding partner in Helicobacter, we initially screened a 
142 
number of Helicobacter mutants devoid of defined virulence factors that have been shown to 
143 
be implicated in various modes of host cell interaction (BabA, SabA, AlpA/B, VacA, gGT, 
144 
urease and the cagPAI)5,6,17. All of these mutants still bound to hu-CEACAM1 (Fig. 3a). 
145 
Therefore we established an immunoprecipitation approach (Extended Data Fig. 3a) using H. 
146 
pylori lysate and recombinant hu-CEACAM1-Fc coupled to protein G. Mass spectrometric 
147 
analysis of the co-precipitate identified two highly conserved H. pylori outer membrane 
148 
proteins as candidate CEACAM1 adhesins: HopQ and HopZ (Fig. 3b). Unlike a hopZ mutant, 
149 
a hopQ deletion mutant was devoid of CEACAM1 binding (Fig. 3c). Importantly, the hopQ 
150 
mutant was also unable to bind to CEACAM5 and 6 (Fig.3c).  
151 
Next we tested the binding of recombinant HopQ to different gastric cancer cell lines and 
152 
found that HopQ interacted with AGS and MKN45 both endogenously expressing 
153 
CEACAMs (Extended Data Fig.3b). HopQ did not bind to the CEACAM negative cell line 
154 
MKN28. Utilizing our CHO transfectants, we found that the recombinant HopQ interacted 
155 
 6 
 
preferentially with CEACAM1 and 5, and to lesser extent to CEACAM3 and 6. No binding 
156 
was observed to CHO cells expressing either CEACAM4, 7, or 8 (Extended Data Fig. 3c). 
157 
HopQ is a member of a H. pylori-specific family of outer membrane proteins, and shows no 
158 
significant homology to other CEACAM-binding adhesins from other Gram-negative 
159 
bacteria, i.e. Opa proteins or UspA1 from Neisseria meningitidis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae 
160 
or Moraxella catarrhalis, respectively, and is therefore a novel bacterial factor hijacking 
161 
CEACAMs. Like Opa and UspA1 13,14, HopQ targets the N-terminal domain in CEACAMs, 
162 
an interaction we found to require folded protein (see below) and was dependent on 
163 
CEACAM sequence, resulting in specificity for human CEACAM1, 3, 5 and 6. The H. pylori 
164 
hopQ gene (omp27; HP1177 in the H. pylori reference strain 26695) exhibits genetic diversity 
165 
that represents two allelic families18, type-I and type-II (Extended Data Fig. 3d), of which the 
166 
type-I allele is found more frequently in cag(+)/s1-vacA type strains. Both alleles share 75 to 
167 
80% nucleotide sequences and exhibit a homology of 70% at the amino acid level18. 
168 
Importantly, hopQ genotype shows a geographic variation, with the hopQ type-I alleles more 
169 
prevalent in Asian compared to Western strains; and was also found to correlate with strain 
170 
virulence, with type-I alleles associated with higher inflammation and gastric atrophy19. 
171 
 
172 
Structure and binding properties of the HopQ adhesin domain 
173 
HopQ belongs to a paralogous family of H. pylori outer membrane proteins (Hop’s), to which 
174 
also the blood group antigen binding adhesins BabA and SabA belong5,6,17,20.To gain insight 
175 
into its structure-function relationship we determined the binding properties and X-ray 
176 
structure of a HopQ fragment corresponding to its predicted extracellular domain (residues 
177 
17-444 of the mature protein; HopQAD; Fig. 4a). HopQAD showed strong, dose dependent 
178 
binding to the N-terminal domain of human CEACAM1 (C1ND; residues 35-142) in ELISA 
179 
(Fig. 4b) and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) revealed a 1:1 stoichiometry with a 
180 
dissociation constant of 296±40 nM (Extended Data Fig. 4a). The HopQAD X-ray structure 
181 
shows that, like BabA and SabA, the HopQ ectodomain adopts a 3+4-helix bundle topology, 
182 
though lacks the extended coiled-coil “stem” domain that connects the ectodomain to the 
183 
transmembrane region (Fig. 4a and Extended Data Fig.4d). In BabA, the carbohydrate binding 
184 
site resides fully in a 4-stranded β-domain that is inserted between helices 4 and 521 (Extended 
185 
Data Fig.4d). In HopQ, a 2-stranded β-hairpin is found in this position (residues 180-218). 
186 
Removal of the β-hairpin resulted in a soluble protein that showed a ~10 fold reduction of 
187 
CEACAM1 binding affinity (Fig. 4b and Extended Data Fig. 4c), indicating that although the 
188 
 7 
 
HopQ insertion domain is implicated in binding, it does not comprise the full binding site as 
189 
found in BabA (Fig. 4b).  
190 
The hitherto characterized Hop adhesins are lectins5,6,17,22. Instead, H. pylori was seen to 
191 
retain binding to CEACAM1 upon enzymatic deglycosylation, and Far Western analysis 
192 
revealed that HopQAD specifically bound folded, but not denatured C1ND (Fig. 4c), 
193 
suggesting HopQ-CEACAM binding relies on protein-protein rather than glycan-dependent 
194 
interactions. Indeed, ITC binding profiles of HopQAD titrated with non-glycosylated E. coli 
195 
expressed C1ND (Ec-C1ND) revealed an equimolar interaction with a dissociation constant of 
196 
417±48 nM (Extended Data Fig. 4b), showing that CEACAM N-glycosylation only provides 
197 
a minor stabilizing contribution to the HopQ-CEACAM interaction. To further map the HopQ 
198 
binding site, we pre-incubated CEACAM1 with the M. catarrhalis adhesin UspA1, and found 
199 
that this prevented binding by H. pylori (Fig. 4d), suggesting that both adhesins have 
200 
overlapping binding epitopes. In further support, mutation of CEACAM1 residues Y34 or I91 
201 
within the UspA1 binding epitope reduced or nearly abrogated CEACAM1 binding by H. 
202 
pylori (Fig. 4e). Interestingly, I91 is conserved in rat but mutated to T in mouse CEACAM1, 
203 
possibly explaining the observed species specificity in HopQ binding (Extended Data Fig. 2a, 
204 
see above). 
205 
 
206 
HopQ – CEACAM1 interaction triggers cell responses 
207 
Available animal models only partially replicate the H. pylori pathogenesis observed in its 
208 
human host and mouse CEACAMs did not support HopQ binding. Therefore, to further 
209 
investigate how HopQ may influence adhesion and cellular responses, we sought to establish 
210 
cellular pathogenesis models in which the HopQ-CEACAM mediated adhesion could be 
211 
analyzed. According to Singer et al.23, we characterized various gastric cell lines typically 
212 
employed for H. pylori in vitro experiments regarding their expression of CEACAMs, and 
213 
observed that MKN45, KatoIII and AGS did express CEACAM1, CEACAM5 and 
214 
CEACAM6, whereas MKN28 showed no presence of CEACAMs (Extended Data Fig.5a and 
215 
b). In parallel, CHO cells were stably transfected with CEACAM1-L (containing the 
216 
immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif (ITIM). Upon infection with H. pylori wild-
217 
type strain P12 and its isogenic hopQ deletion mutant, we observed a significantly reduced 
218 
adherence to CHO-CEACAM1-L, MKN45 and AGS cells when hopQ was not present, while 
219 
strains deficient in the adhesins BabA and SabA showed only slightly reduced adhesion (Fig. 
220 
5a and Extended Data Fig.5c). HopQ binding was also studied in human gastric biopsies from 
221 
H. pylori infected individuals. Here, we detected that HopQ bound to the apical side human 
222 
 8 
 
gastric epithelium and co-localized with CEACAM in biopsies from H. pylori infected 
223 
individuals (Fig. 5b and Extended Data Fig. 5d), while no binding was observed in 
224 
CEACAM1 negative samples from normal stomach (not shown). In CHO-CEACAM1-L 
225 
cells, we observed tyrosine-phosphorylation of the CEACAM1 ITIM domain upon exposure 
226 
to H. pylori, which was apparent within 5 minutes, and was maintained for up to 1 hour 
227 
(Fig.5c). Phosphorylation of the CEACAM1 ITIM domain is a well-known initial event 
228 
triggering SHP1/2 recruitment inducing downstream signaling cascades24,25. Contact-
229 
dependent signaling through CEACAMs is a common means of modulating immune 
230 
responses related to infection, inflammation and cancer10, and these immune-dampening 
231 
cascades likely reflect the multiple independent emergence of non-homologous CEACAM-
232 
interacting proteins in diverse mucosal Gram-negative pathogens including Neisseria, 
233 
Haemophilus, Escherichia, Salmonella, Moraxella sp.13,14. For H. pylori, interaction with 
234 
human CEACAM1 through HopQ may represent a critical parameter for immuno-modulatory 
235 
signaling during colonization and chronic infection of man. 
236 
Additionally, hopQ mutant H. pylori strains showed an almost complete loss of cagPAI-
237 
dependent CagA translocation (Fig. 5d) and strongly reduced IL-8 induction (Fig.5e), while 
238 
loss of other known adhesins had no effect on CagA delivery (Extended Data Fig.5e and f). 
239 
This is in line with a previous study showing that in AGS gastric cancer cells, a hopQ mutant 
240 
H. pylori strain exhibited reduced ability to activate NF-κB and altered translocation of 
241 
CagA26. In contrast to our findings, Belogolova et al. did not observe reduced adherence of a 
242 
hopQ mutant H. pylori P12 strain, which could be due to the observed growth dependent 
243 
expression of CEACAMs in these cells.  
244 
To corroborate our data in an independent model and compensate for potential clonal effects 
245 
in stably transfected cells, we transiently transfected HEK293 cells with human CEACAM (1-
246 
L,3,4,5,6,7,8) expression plasmids. Infection of these cells confirmed the defect in CagA 
247 
translocation 
observed 
in 
CHO-CEACAM1-L 
cells, 
which 
was 
restored 
upon 
248 
complementation of the hopQ mutant strain (P12ΔhopQhopQ+) (Fig.5f and Extended Data 
249 
Fig.5g). Also, cellular elongation, the so called “hummingbird phenotype”, was significantly 
250 
reduced upon deletion of hopQ (Fig. 5g and h). Further, we observed that H. pylori modulates 
251 
important host transcription factors such as Myc or STAT3, in a hopQ-dependent fashion 
252 
(Extended Data Fig. 5h). Our results reveal that HopQ-CEACAM binding leads to direct and 
253 
indirect alterations in host cell signaling cascades, and start to shed light on these HopQ-
254 
associated virulence landscapes. Given the importance of these signaling events for gastric 
255 
carcinogenesis, we explored if the CEACAM-HopQ interaction could be targeted in order to 
256 
 9 
 
prevent CagA translocation and downstream effects. Indeed, incubation of the cells with an α-
257 
CEACAM1 antibody, α-HopQ antiserum or a HopQ-derived peptide corresponding to the 
258 
Hop-ID (aa 189-220) reduced CagA translocation in a dose dependent manner (Fig. 5i-k), but 
259 
not corresponding controls (Extended Data Fig. 5h). These data demonstrate that the HopQ-
260 
CEACAM1 interaction is necessary for successful translocation of the oncoprotein CagA into 
261 
epithelial cells as well as modulation of inflammatory signaling, and that interference with 
262 
this interaction can prevent CagA translocation, giving an indication of the translational 
263 
potential of HopQ targeting for H. pylori vaccination or immunotherapy.   
264 
 
265 
Deletion of hopQ abrogates colonization in a rat model of H. pylori infection 
266 
As we have found binding of HopQ to human and rat, but not to mouse CEACAM, we finally 
267 
determined the role of HopQ in vivo, using a rat model of H. pylori infection. Having 
268 
observed that CEACAM1 was expressed in normal rat stomach (Fig. 6a and Extended Data 
269 
Fig. 6b), we infected rats with the mouse adapted strain SS1, able to bind human and rat 
270 
CEACAM1 (Extended Data Fig. 6a). While the wilt type SS1 was able to efficiently colonize 
271 
rats, albeit at lower levels compared to the mouse, (Fig. 6b) , the hopQ deficient SS1 strain 
272 
was not able to colonize rats at detectable levels, and could not induce an inflammatory 
273 
response in comparison to the wild type SS1 strain (Fig. 6b and c). Therefore, in this model, 
274 
HopQ seems also to serve as an important factor to mediate H. pylori colonization. While 
275 
infection of rats with H. pylori has been described27, our finding may allow the establishment 
276 
of an animal model for studying H. pylori infection that better replicates the prevailing 
277 
virulence pathways.  
278 
 
 
279

Discussion 
280 
The here identified CEACAM-binding property provides H. pylori a means of 
281 
epithelial adherence in addition to the Lewis antigens used by the BabA and SabA 
282 
adhesins5,6,17. While over-expression of CEACAMs in gastrointestinal tumors is well 
283 
described, their up-regulation during H. pylori-induced inflammation in the stomach has not 
284 
been reported so far, suggesting the pathogen has the ability to shape its own adhesive niche. 
285 
A similar phenomenon has also been observed for the inflammation-induced up-regulation of 
286 
sialylated antigens that form the receptors for the SabA adhesin6. A plausible route to 
287 
CEACAM modulation is through the transcription factors NF-κB and AP1, both of which are 
288 
induced during H. pylori infection28 and are known to regulate CEACAM expression29. 
289 
Though HopQ-dependent adherence may appear redundant to that of other adhesins like 
290 
BabA, SabA or LabA, HopQ specializes on human CEACAMs and is required for cagPAI 
291 
functionality. From the perspective of host-pathogen (i.e. human-H. pylori) co-evolution, the 
292 
primary function of HopQ may lie in immune-modulation through CEACAM binding, and 
293 
HopQ’s indirect effects on other virulence cascades elicited by H. pylori such as that induced 
294 
by increased CagA delivery may not have been initially “intended“. The cagPAI was acquired 
295 
by ancestral H. pylori in a single event that occurred before modern humans migrated out of 
296 
East Africa around 58,000 years ago30. Thus, it is likely that the employment of CEACAM1 
297 
ligation by H. pylori occurred much earlier to support colonization and to modulate immune 
298 
responses. This assumption is supported by the fact that all fully sequenced H. pylori strains 
299 
bear hopQ (Extended Data Fig.3d), indicating that this is an essential outer membrane protein 
300 
of H. pylori. Upon occurrence of type-I H. pylori strains by cagPAI acquisition more than 
301 
60,000 years ago30 this ancient survival strategy was further implemented into a mechanism 
302 
supporting pathogenicity, and thus may have contributed to the switch from commensal to 
303 
pathogenic H. pylori31. Pathogenicity might even be further aggravated by our observation 
304 
that CEACAMs are strongly up-regulated during gastritis, which further potentiates binding 
305 
of H. pylori to epithelial cells and specifically facilitates CagA/cagPAI interaction with the 
306 
host cells.   
307 
Taken together, the finding that H. pylori employs CEACAMs not only for bacterial 
308 
adherence but also to induce cellular signaling may lead to a better understanding of the 
309 
pathogenic mechanisms of these bacteria and might lead to novel therapeutic approaches to 
310 
more effectively combat this highly prevalent infection and the associated gastric pathology.

Bacteria and bacterial growth conditions 
317 
The H. pylori strains G2732, PMSS133, SS134, J99 (ATCC, 700824), 280835, 26695 (ATCC, 
318 
70039), TX3036, 6019037, P1238, NCTC11637 (ATCC, 43504), Ka89 and H. bilis 
319 
(ATCC43879) were grown on Wilkins–Chalgren blood agar plates under microaerobic 
320 
conditions (10% CO2, 5% O2, 8.5% N2, and 37°C). H. suis39 and H. heilmannii40 were grown 
321 
on Brucella agar and H. felis (ATCC 49179) and H. bizzozeronii41 on brain-heart infusion 
322 
(BHI) agar supplemented with 10% horse blood. Moraxella catarrhalis (ATCC, 25238) 
323 
provided by C. R. Hauck (Konstanz Research School Chemical Biology, University of 
324 
Konstanz, Germany), Moraxella Lacunata (ATCC 17967) and Campylobacter jejuni (ATCC, 
325 
33560) were cultured on brain–heart infusion (BHI) agar supplemented with 5% heated horse 
326 
blood overnight at 37°C in a CO2 incubator. The generation of an isogenic ΔhopQ mutant has 
327 
been done by replacement of the entire gene by a chloramphenicol resistance cassette. For 
328 
genetic complementation of hopQ, the 1,926 bp gene fragment of H. pylori strain P12 was 
329 
amplified by PCR. This fragment was cloned into the complementation vector pSB1001 using 
330 
the AphA3 cassette for selection. This fusion construct was introduced in the plasticity region 
331 
of strain P12ΔhopQ (between ORFs HP0999 and HP1000) using a strategy as described42.

Production of CEACAM proteins 
333 
The cDNA, which encodes the extracellular domains of human CEACAM1-Fc (consisting of 
334 
N-A1-B1-A2 domains), human CEACAM1dN-Fc (consisting of A1-B1-A2, lacking the first 
335 
143 amino acids of the N-terminal IgV-like domain), rat CEACAM1-Fc (consisting of N-A1-
336 
B1-A2), rat CEACAM1dN-Fc (consisting of A1-B1-A2), human CEACAM3-Fc (consisting 
337 
of N), human CEACAM6-Fc (consisting of N-A-B), human CEACAM8-Fc (consisting of N-
338 
A-B), respectively, were fused to a human heavy chain Fc-domain and cloned into the 
339 
pcDNA3.1(+) expression vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA), sequenced and stably 
340 
transfected into HEK293 (ATCC CRL-1573)cells as described43. The Fc chimeric CEACAM-
341 
Fc proteins were accumulated in serum-free Pro293s-CDM medium (Lonza) and were 
342 
recovered by Protein A/G-Sepharose affinity Chromatography (Pierce). Proteins were 
343 
analyzed by SDS-PAGE and stained by Coomassie blue demonstrating an equal amount and 
344 
integrity of the produced fusion proteins (Extended Data Fig. 1i). Recombinant-human 
345 
CEACAM5-Fc was ordered from Sino Biological Inc. The GFP-tagged CEACAMs (human-
346 
CEACAM1 and its variants, mouse-CEACAM1, bovine-CEACAM1 and canine-CEACAM1) 
347 
 12 
 
were provided by Dr. C. R. Hauck (University Konstanz, Germany). For production of the 
348 
recombinant human CEACAM1 N-Domain (C1ND), the annotated domain (residues 35-142 
349 
of CEACAM1, Uniprot ID: P13688) was first backtranslated using the Gene 
350 
Optimizer® (LifeTechnologies) and the leader sequence of the Igk-chain as well as a C-
351 
terminal Strep-Tag II was added. The gene was synthesized and seamlessly cloned into 
352 
pCDNA3.4-TOPO (LifeTechnologies). Protein was produced in a 2 L culture of Expi293 
353 
cells according to the Expi293 expression system instructions (LifeTechnologies). 
354 
The resulting supernatant was concentrated and diafiltered against ten volumes of 1x 
355 
SAC buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl, 140 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0) by crossflow-
356 
filtration, using a Hydrosart 5 kDa molecular-weight cutoff membrane (Sartorius). The 
357 
retentate was loaded onto a StrepTrap HP column (GE Healthcare) and eluted with 1x SAC 
358 
supplemented with 2.5 mM D-Desthiobiotin (IBA). The protein was stored at +4°C.  
359 
For the bacterial expression of the C1ND (Ec-C1ND) the amino acid sequence (residues 35-
360 
142 of CEACAM1, Uniprot ID: P13688) was codon optimized for expression in E. coli, 
361 
synthesized by GeneArt de novo gene synthesis (Life Technologies), and cloned with a C-
362 
terminal His6 tag in the pDESTTM14 vector using Gateway technology (Invitrogen). E. coli 
363 
C43(DE3) cells were transformed with the resulting construct and grown in LB supplemented 
364 
with 100 µg/mL ampicillin at 37°C while shaking. At OD600=1 Ec-C1ND expression was 
365 
induced with 1 mM IPTG overnight at 30°C. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 6.238 g 
366 
for 15 minutes at 4°C and resuspended in 50mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 500 mM NaCl (4 mL/g wet 
367 
cells) supplemented with 5 µM leupeptin and 1 mM AEBSF, 100 µg/mL lysozyme, and 20 
368 
µg/mL DNase I. Subsequently cells were lysed by a single passage in a Constant System Cell 
369 
Cracker at 20 kPsi at 4 °C and debris was removed by centrifugation at 48.400 g for 40 
370 
minutes. The cytoplasmic extract was filtrated through a 0.45 µm pore filter and loaded on a 5 
371 
mL pre-packed Ni-NTA column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with buffer A (50 mM Tris-
372 
HCl pH 7.4, 500 mM NaCl and 20 mM imidazole). The column was then washed with 40 bed 
373 
volumes of buffer A and bound proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 0-75 % buffer B 
374 
(50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 500 mM NaCl and 500 mM imidazole). Fractions containing Ec-
375 
C1ND, as determined by SDS-PAGE, were pooled and concentrated in a 10 kDa MW cutoff 
376 
spin concentrator to a final volume of 5 ml. To remove minor protein contaminants, the 
377 
concentrated sample was injected onto the Hi-Prep™ 26/60 Sephacryl S-100 HR column (GE 
378 
Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with a buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl. 
379 
Fractions containing the Ec-C1ND complex were pooled and concentrated using a 10 kDa 
380 
MW cutoff spin concentrator.

383 
HopQAD and HopQADΔID cloning, production and purification 
384 
In order to obtain a soluble HopQ fragment, the HopQ gene from the H. pylori G27 strain 
385 
(accession No. CP001173 Region: 1228696..1230621) HopQ fragment ranging from residues 
386 
37 – 463 was produced (residues 17-444 of the mature protein), thus removing the N-terminal 
387 
β-strand and signal peptide, as well as the C-terminal β-domain expected to represent the TM 
388 
domain. In HopQADΔID, the amino acids 184-212 of the mature protein were replaced by two 
389 
glycines (Extended Data Fig.f). DNA coding sequences corresponding to the HopQ type I 
390 
fragments was PCR-amplified from H. pylori G27 genomic DNA using primers (forward: 
391 
GTTTAACTTTAAGAAGGAGATATACAAATGGCGGTTCAAAAAGTGAAAAACGC; 
392 
reverse: TCAAGCTTATTAATGATGATGATGATGGTGGGCGCCGTTATTCGTGGTTG), 
393 
containing 30bp overlap to the flanking target vector sequences of pPRkana-1, a derivative of 
394 
pPR-IBA 1 (IBA GmbH) with the ampicillin resistance cassette replaced by the kanamycin 
395 
resistance cassette, under a T7 promotor. In parallel, the vector was PCR-amplified using 
396 
primers (forward: CACCATCATCATCATCATTAATAAGCTTGATCCGGCTGCTAAC ; 
397 
reverse: GTTTAACTTTAAGAAGGAGATATACAAATG) as provided in table 1, using the 
398 
same overlapping sequences in reversed orientation. The forward primer additionally carried 
399 
the sequence for a 6x His-tag. The amplicons were seamlessly cloned using Gibson Assembly 
400 
(New England Biolabs GmbH). Based on codon optimized HopQAD plasmid, the HopQADΔID 
401 
constructs were cloned. The plasmids were amplified by 5’ phosphorylated primers (forward: 
402 
GGTGACGCTCAGAACCTGCTGAC; 
reverse: 
ACCACCTTTAGAGTTCAGCGGAG) 
403 
replacing the ID region by two glycines, DpnI (NEB) digested and blunt-end ligated by T4 
404 
ligase (NEB). 
405 
Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells (NEB GmbH) were transformed with the pPRkana-1 
406 
constructs, grown at 37°C with 275 rpm on auto-inducing terrific broth (TRB) according to 
407 
Studier44, supplemented with 2 mM MgSO4, 100 mg/L Kanamycin-Sulfate (Carl Roth GmbH 
408 
+ Co. KG), 0.2 g/L PPG2000 (Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.2% w/v Lactose-monohydrate (Sigma-
409 
Aldrich), until an OD of 1-2 was reached. Afterwards, the temperature was lowered to 25°C 
410 
and auto-induced overnight, reaching a final OD of 10-15 the following morning. Cells were 
411 
harvested by centrifugation at 6000 g for 15 min at 4 °C using a SLA-3000 rotor in a Sorvall 
412 
RC-6 Plus centrifuge (Thermo Fischer). Prior to cell disruption, cells were resuspended in 10 
413 
mL cold NiNTA buffer A (500 mM NaCl, 100 mM Tris-HCl, 25 mM Imidazole, pH 7.4) per 
414 
gram of biological wet weight (BWW), supplemented with 0.1 mM AEBSF-HCl, 150 U/g 
415 
 14 
 
BWW DNase I and 5 mM MgCl2and dispersed with an Ultra-Turrax T25 digital (IKA GmbH 
416 
+ Co. KG). Cell disruption was performed by high-pressure homogenization with a 
417 
PANDA2000 (GEA NiroSoavi) at 800-1200 bar in 3 passages at 4 °C. The cell lysate was 
418 
clarified by centrifugation at 25000 g for 30 min at 4 °C in a SLA-1500 rotor and remaining 
419 
particles removed by filtration through a 0.2 µM filter. 
420 
HopQ fragments were purified by consecutive nickel affinity and size exclusion 
421 
chromatography. Briefly, the clarified cell lysate was loaded onto a 5 mL pre-packed Ni-NTA 
422 
HisTrap FF crude column (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with buffer A, washed with ten 
423 
column volumes (CV) of buffer A and the bound protein eluted with a 15 CV linear gradient 
424 
to 75% NiNTA buffer B (500 mM NaCl, 100 mM Tris-HCl, 500 mM Imidazole, pH 7.4). 
425 
Eluted peak fractions were collected, pooled and concentrated to a final concentration of 8-10 
426 
mg ml-1 using a 10 kDa molecular-weight cutoff spin concentrator. Subsequently, 5 mL of the 
427 
concentrated protein were loaded onto a HiLoad 16/600 Superdex 75 pg column (GE 
428 
Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with Buffer C (5 mM Tris-HCl, 140 mM NaCl, pH 7.3) and 
429 
eluted at 1 mL/min. Finally, only protein corresponding to the monomer-peak was pooled and 
430 
stored at +4 °C prior to crystallization. For analyzing the multimerization state of HopQAD, 
431 
SEC was performed on a Superdex 200 10/300 GL (GE Healthcare) with 24 mL bed volume. 
432 
The column was pre-equilibrated with Buffer C and subsequently, 25 µg protein injected and 
433 
separated with a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min. 
434 
The HopQ interaction domain (HopQ-ID) representing peptide was HA-tagged, synthesized 
435 
(EKLEAHVTTSKYQQDNQTKTTTSVIDTTNYPYDVPDYA) and HPLC purified (Peptide 
436 
Specialty Laboratories, Heidelberg, Germany). For cellular assays, the lyophilized peptide 
437 
was dissolved in sterile PBS to a concentration of 1 mM and dialysed with a 0.1-0.5 kDa 
438 
molecular-weight cutoff membrane against PBS to remove remaining TFA. The peptide 
439 
solution was stored at -20 °C until further use. 
440 
Detection of the HopQ-CEACAM interaction by ELISA 
441 
For detection of the interaction between CEACAM and HopQAD, recombinant C1ND (1 
442 
µg/mL) in PBS was coated over night at 4 °C onto a 96-well immunoplate (Nunc MaxiSorb). 
443 
Wells were blocked with SmartBlock (Candor) for 2 h at RT. Subsequently, HopQ fragments 
444 
were added in a fivefold series dilution ranging from 10 µg/mL to 0.05 ng/mL for 2h at room 
445 
temperature. Next, anα-6xHis-HRP conjugate (clone 3D5, LifeTechnologies) was diluted 
446 
1:5000 and incubated for 1h at room temperature. For detection, 1-Step™ Ultra TMB-ELISA 
447 
Substrate Solution (LifeTechnologies) was used and the enzymatic reaction was stopped with 
448 
 15 
 
2 N H2SO4. Washing (3-5x) in between incubation steps was carried out with PBS / 0.05% 
449 
Tween20.  
450 
Isothermal titration calorimetry 
451 
ITC measurements were performed on a MicroCal iTC200 calorimeter (Malvern). 25 µM 
452 
C1ND or EcC1ND were loaded into the cell of the calorimeter and 250 µM HopQAD type I 
453 
was loaded in the syringe. All measurements were done at 25°C, with a stirring speed of 600 
454 
rpm and performed in 20 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol and 
455 
0.05% (v/v) Tween-20. Binding data were analyzed using the MicroCal LLC ITC200 
456 
software. 
457 
SDS-PAGE and native-PAGE for Western blot 
458 
CEACAM was separated with both SDS-PAGE and native-PAGE (resp. on 15% and 7.5% 
459 
polyacrylamide gels) in ice-cold 25 mM Tris-HCl, 250 mM glycine buffer. Subsequently 
460 
samples were transferred to PVDF-membranes by wet blotting at 25 V during 60 minutes in 
461 
ice-cold transfer buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl, 250 mM glycine and 20% methanol). Membranes 
462 
were blocked during one hour in 10% milk powder (MP), 1x PBS and 0.005% Tween-20. 
463 
Both membranes were washed and incubated together in 5% MP, 1x PBS, 0.005% Tween-20 
464 
in presence of 2 µM HopQAD type I for one hour to allow complex formation between 
465 
HopQAD I and CEACAM. After a washing step the C-terminal His-tag of HopQ (CEACAM is 
466 
strep tagged) was detected by adding consecutively mouse α-His (AbDSerotec) and goat α-
467 
mouse antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) during respectively one hour and 30 minutes in 5% MP, 1x 
468 
PBS, 0.005% Tween-20. After a washing step the blot was developed by adding BCIP/NBT 
469 
substrate 
(5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate/nitro 
blue 
tetrazolium) 
(Roche) 
in 
470 
developing buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 9.5, 100 mM NaCl, 50 mM MgCl2). 
471 
Bacterial pull down 
472 
Bacteria were grown overnight on WC dent agar plates. Bacteria were scraped from plates, 
473 
suspended in PBS, and colony forming units (cfu) were estimated by optical density 600 
474 
readings according to a standard curve. Bacteria were washed twice with PBS and 
475 
2 × 108 cells/mL were incubated with soluble CEACAM-Fc or CEACAM-GFP proteins or 
476 
CHO cell lysates for 1 h at 37 °C with head-over-head rotation. After incubation, bacteria 
477 
were washed 5 times with PBS and either boiled in SDS sample buffer (62.5 mM Tris-HCl 
478 
[pH 6.8], 2% w/v SDS, 10% glycerol, 50 mM DTT, and 0.01% w/v bromophenol blue) prior 
479 
to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting or taken up in FACS buffer (PBS/0.5% BSA) for flow 
480 
cytometry analysis.  
481

Immunoprecipitation and Mass Spectrometry 
482 
Bacteria (2x108) in cold PBS containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Roche) were 
483 
lysed by ultra-sonication on ice (10x, 20s). Cell debris was removed from the lysates by 
484 
centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C, followed by pre-clearing with prewashed 
485 
protein G-agarose (Roche Diagnostics).  CEACAM1-Fc was added to the lysate (10 µg) and 
486 
incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. Prewashed protein G-agarose (60 μL) were added to the antibody 
487 
and lysate mixture and incubated 2 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed with PBS for five times to 
488 
remove unspecifically bound proteins. Two-thirds of the beads were separated and used for 
489 
mass spectrometry sample preparation. The supernatant was removed and the beads were 
490 
resuspended twice in 50 µL 7M urea/ 2 M thiourea solved in 20 mM Hepes (pH 7.5) for 
491 
denaturation of the proteins. Beads were pelleted by centrifugation and supernatants pooled 
492 
and transferred to a new Eppendorf tube. Subsequently, proteins were reduced in 1 mM DTT 
493 
for 45 min and alkylated at a final concentration of 5.5 mM iodacetamide for 30 min in the 
494 
dark. The alkylation step was quenched by raising the DTT concentration to 5 mM for 30 
495 
min. All incubation steps were carried out at RT under vigorous shaking (Eppendorf shaker, 
496 
450 rpm). For digestion of the proteins 1 µL LysC (0.5 µg/µL) was added and the sample 
497 
incubated for 4h at RT. To reduce the urea concentration the sample was diluted 1:4 with 50 
498 
mM triethylammonium bicarbonate and then incubated with 1.5 µL trypsin (0.5 µg/µL) at 37 
499 
°C over night. Trypsin was finally inactivated by acidification with formic acid. The 
500 
supernatant was transferred to a new Eppendorf tube and pooled with the following wash 
501 
fraction of the beads with 0.1% formic acid. The sample was adjusted to pH 3 with formic 
502 
acid (100% v/v) and subjected to peptide desalting with a SepPak C18 column (50 mg, 
503 
Waters). Briefly, the column was subsequently washed with 1 mL 100% acetonitrile and 500 
504 
µL 80% acetonitrile, 0.5% formic acid. The column was equilibrated with 1 mL 0.1% TFA, 
505 
the sample was loaded and the column washed again with 1 mL 0.1% TFA. After an 
506 
additional wash step with 500 µL 0.5% formic acid peptides were eluted twice with 250 µL 
507 
80% acetonitrile, 0.5% formic acid. The organic phase was then removed by vacuum 
508 
centrifugation and peptides stored at -80 °C. Directly before measurement peptides were 
509 
resolved in 20 µL 0.1% formic acid, sonified for 5 min (water bath) and the sample afterwards 
510 
filtered with a prewashed and equilibrated filter (0.45 µm low protein binding filter, VWR 
511 
International, LLC). Measurements were performed on an LC-MS system consisting of an 
512 
Ultimate 3000 nano HPLC directly linked to an Orbitrap XL instrument (Thermo Scientific). 
513 
Samples were loaded onto a trap column (2 µm, 100 A, 2 cm length) and separated on a 15 
514 
cm C18 column (2 µm, 100 A, Thermo Scientific) during a 150 min gradient ranging from 5 
515 
 17 
 
to 30% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid. Survey spectra were acquired in the orbitrap with a 
516 
resolution of 60,000 at m/z 400. For protein identification up to five of the most intense ions 
517 
of the full scan were sequentially isolated and fragmented by collision induced dissociation. 
518 
The received data was analyzed with the Proteome Discoverer Software version 1.4 (Thermo 
519 
Scientific) and searched against the H. pylori (strain G27) database (1501 proteins) in the 
520 
SEQUEST algorithm. Protein N-terminal acetylation and oxidation of methionins were added 
521 
as variable modifications, carbamidomethylation on cysteines as static modifications. Enzyme 
522 
specificity was set to trypsin and mass tolerances of the precursor and fragment ions were set 
523 
to 10 ppm and 0.8 Da, respectively. Only peptides that fulfilled Xcorr values of 1.5, 2.0, 2.25 
524 
and 2.5 for charge states +1, +2, +3 and +4 respectively were considered for data analysis. 
525 
Cells, cell-bacteria co-culture and elongation phenotype quantitation assay 
526 
Gastric cancer cell lines MKN4545, KatoIII (ATCC, HTB-103), MKN28 46 and AGS (ATCC, 
527 
CRL-1739) were obtained from ATCC and DSMZ, authenticated by utilizing Short Tandem 
528 
Repeat (STR) profiling, cultured either sparse or to tight confluence in DMEM (GIBCO, 
529 
Invitrogen, Carlsbad CA, USA) containing 2 mM L-glutamine (GIBCO, Invitrogen, CA, 
530 
USA) supplemented with 10% FBS (GIBCO, Invitrogen, CA, USA) and 1% Penicillin/ 
531 
Streptomycin (GIBCO, Invitrogen, CA, USA). All cell lines were maintained in an incubator 
532 
at 37°C with 5% CO2 and 100% humidity, and were routinely mycoplasma-tested twice per 
533 
year by DAPI stain and PCR. Plate-grown bacteria were suspended in DMEM and washed by 
534 
centrifugation at 150 g for 5 min in a microcentrifuge. After resuspension in DMEM, the 
535 
optical density at 600 nm was determined and bacteria were added to the overnight serum-
536 
deprived cells at different ratios of bacteria/cell (MOI) at 37°C to start the infection. After the 
537 
indicated time, cells were washed twice with PBS and then lysed with 1% NP-40 in protease 
538 
& phosphatase inhibitor PBS. HEK293 cells were chosen for CEACAM transfection studies 
539 
because the cells were found to be negative for hu-CEACAM expression, and are easily 
540 
transfectable. HEK cells were grown in 6-well plates containing RPMI 1640 medium 
541 
(Invitrogen) supplemented with 25 mM HEPES buffer and 10% heat-inactivated FBS 
542 
(Biochrom, Berlin, Germany) for 2 days to approximately 70% confluence. Cells were serum-
543 
deprived overnight and infected with H. pylori at MOI 50 for the indicated time points in each 
544 
figure. After infection, the cells were harvested in ice-cold PBS containing 1 mM Na3VO4 
545 
(Sigma-Aldrich). Elongated AGS cells in each experiment were quantified in 5 different 0.25-
546 
mm2 fields using an Olympus IX50 phase contrast microscope.

Transfection 
548 
A CHO cell line (ATCC) permanently expressing hu-CEACAM1-4L, mouse-CEACAM1-L 
549 
and rat-CEACAM1-L were generated by stably transfecting cells with 4 µg pcDNA3.1-
550 
huCEACAM1-4L, pcDNA3.1-huCEACAM1-4S, pcDNA3.1-msCEACAM1-L, pcDNA3.1-
551 
ratCEACAM1-L plasmid (Singer), respectively, utilizing the lipofectamine 2000 procedure 
552 
according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). Stable transfected cells were selected in 
553 
culture medium containing 1 mg/mL of Geniticinsulfat (G418, Biochrom, Berlin, Germany). 
554 
The surface expression of CEACAM1 in individual clones growing in log phase was 
555 
determined by flow cytometry (FACS calibur, BD). HEK293 cells were transfected with 4 μg 
556 
of the HA-tagged CEACAM constructs or luciferase reporter constructs (Clontech, Germany) 
557 
for 48 h with TurboFect reagent (Fermentas, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s 
558 
instructions. 
559 
Western blot 
560 
An equal volume of cell lysate was loaded on 8% SDS-PAGE gels and after electrophoresis, 
561 
separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Whatman/GE Healthcare, 
562 
Freiburg, Germany). Membranes were blocked in 5% non-fat milk for 1 h at room 
563 
temperature and incubated overnight with primary antibodies mAb 18/20 binding to 
564 
CEACAM1,3,5, B3-17 and C5-1X (mono-specific for hu-CEACAM1, Singer), 4/3/17 
565 
(binding to CEACAM1,5, Genovac), and 5C8C4 (mono-specific for hu-CEACAM5, Singer), 
566 
1H7-4B (mono-specific for hu-CEACAM6, Singer), 6/40c (mono-specific for hu-CEACAM8, 
567 
Singer), Be9.2 (α-rat-CEACAM1, kindly provided by Dr. W. Reutter, Charite, CBF, 
568 
Germany), mAb 11-1H (α-rat-CEACAM1ΔN, Singer), phosphotyrosine antibody PY-99 
569 
(Santa Cruz, LaJolla, CA, USA), α-CagAphosphotyrosine antibody PY-972 47, mouse 
570 
monoclonal α-CagA antibody (Austral Biologicals, San Ramon, CA, USA), mouse 
571 
monoclonal α-CEACAM1 (clone D14HD11Genovac/Aldevron, Freiburg,Germany) or goat 
572 
α-GAPDH (Santa Cruz). After washing, membranes were incubated with the secondary 
573 
antibody [HRP-conjugated α-mouse IgG (Promega)] and proteins were detected by ECL 
574 
Western Blotting Detection reagents. The quantification was done by LabImage 1D software 
575 
(INTAS). 
576 
Flow cytometry 
577 
The Fc-tagged CEACAMs (2.5 µg/mL) were incubated with H. pylori (OD600=1) and 
578 
subsequently with FITC-conjugated goat α-human IgG (Sigma-Aldrich). After washing with 
579 
 19 
 
FACS buffer, the samples were analyzed by gating on the bacteria (based on forward and 
580 
sideward scatter) and measuring bacteria-associated fluorescence. In each case, 10,000 events 
581 
per sample were obtained. Analysis was performed with the FACS CyAn (Beckman Coulter) 
582 
and the data were evaluated with FlowJo software (Treestar). For the analysis of CEACAM 
583 
mediated HopQ binding, indicated cell types (5×105 in 50 µL) were incubated with 20 µg/mL 
584 
of H. pylori strain P12 derived,myc and 6x His-tagged recombinant HopQdiluted in 3% 
585 
FCS/PBS for 1 h on ice. After three times washing with 3% FCS/PBS samples were labeled 
586 
with 20 µg/mL of mouse α-c-mycmAb (clone 9E10, AbDSerotec) and subsequently with 
587 
FITC conjugated goat α-mouse F(ab')2 (Dianova, Germany). In parallel, the presence of 
588 
CEACAMs was controlled by staining cells utilizing the rabbit anti CEA pAb (A0115, 
589 
Dianova) followed by FITC conjugated goat α-rabbit F(ab')2 (Dianova, Germany). 
590 
Background fluorescence was determined using isotype-matched Ig mAb. The stained cell 
591 
samples were examined in a FACScalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA) 
592 
and the data were analyzed utilizing the CellQuest software. Dead cells, identified by PI 
593 
staining, were excluded from the measurement. 
594 
Immunohistochemistry and Immunofluorescence 
595 
Following approval of the local ethics committee, paraffin-embedded human normal stomach, 
596 
gastritis and cancer samples were randomly chosen from the tissue bank of the Institut für 
597 
Pathologie, Klinikum Bayreuth Germany. Histological samples were excluded if tissue 
598 
quality was poor. After antigen retrieval with 10 mM sodium citrate buffer pH 6 in pressure 
599 
cooker, the sections were incubated with α-hu-CEACAM1, 5, 6 and α-rat-CEACAM1 
600 
antibodies (clone B3-17, 5C8C4, 1H7-4B and Be9.2, respectively). Sections were developed 
601 
with SignalStain DAB (Cell Signaling) following manufacturer’s instructions. Sections were 
602 
counterstained with hematoxylin (Morphisto). The automated image acquisition was 
603 
performed with Olympus Virtual Slide System VS120 (Olympus, Hamburg, Germany).  
604 
Visualization of the co-localization of HopQ and CEACAMs co-staining of normal and 
605 
gastritis sections was performed utilizing HopQ-biotin followed by streptavidin-Cy3 and α-
606 
hu-CEACAM1, 3, 5, 6, 8 clone 6G5j followed by Alexa 488 coupled goat anti mouse 
607 
antibody. The cell nuclei were stained with DAPI. DAPI and fluorescent proteins were 
608 
analyzed with the Leica DMI4000B microscope. 
609 
Adherence assay 
610 
The adherence assay was performed according to Hytonen et al 48. Briefly, human gastric 
611 
epithelial cells (MKN45 and AGS) and CEACAM1-transfected CHO cells were grown in 
612 
 20 
 
antibiotic free DMEM (Gibco, Gaithersburg, MD) supplemented with 5% FCS and L-
613 
glutamine (2 mM, Sigma-Aldrich) on tissue culture 96 well plates (Bioscience) in 5% CO2 
614 
atmosphere for 2 days. To visualize H. pylori cells in adhesion assays, OD600=1 of bacteria 
615 
were fluorescence labeled with CFDA-SE (Molecular Probes) and washed with PBS. CFDA-
616 
SE was added at concentration of 10 µM for 30 min at 37˚C under constant rotation in the 
617 
dark. Excess dye was removed by 3 times washing with PBS. Bacteria were resuspended in 
618 
PBS until further use. Labelled bacteria were co-incubated (MOI 10) with the cells at 37°C 
619 
with gentle agitation for 1 h. After washing with PBS (1 mL, ×3) to remove non-adherent 
620 
bacteria, cells were fixed in paraformaldehyde (2%, 10 min). Bacterial binding was 
621 
determined by measuring the percentage of cells that bound fluorescent-labeled bacteria using 
622 
flow cytometry analysis. 
623 
IL-8 cytokine ELISA 
624 
AGS cell line was infected with H. pylori as described already and PBS-incubated control 
625 
cells served as negative control. The culture supernatants were collected and stored at -20 °C 
626 
until assayed. IL-8 concentration in the supernatant was determined by standard ELISA with 
627 
commercially available assay kits (Becton Dickinson, Germany) according to described 
628 
procedures.  
629 
 
630 
HopQ-dependency of CagA virulence pathways 
631 
If not indicated otherwise, the AGS cell line (ATCC CRL-1730) was infected with the various 
632 
H. pylori strains for 6 hours at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 50. The cells were then 
633 
harvested in ice-cold PBS in the presence of 1 mM Na3VO4 (Sigma-Aldrich). In each 
634 
experiment the number of elongated AGS cells was quantified in 10 different 0.25-mm2 fields 
635 
using a phase contrast microscope (Olympus IX50). CagA translocation was determined using 
636 
the indicated antibodies detecting Tyr-phosphorylated CagA. All experiments were performed 
637 
in triplicates. For inhibition experiments, cells were incubated with the indicated antibodies or 
638 
peptides prior to infection.  
639 
Confocal microscopy 
640 
CHO cells were grown on chamber slides (Thermo Scientific), fixed in paraformaldehyde 
641 
(4%, 10 min) and blocked with PBS/5% bovine serum albumin. CFDA-SE labelled bacteria 
642 
(10 µM for 30 min at 37˚C under constant rotation in the dark) at MOI 5 were incubated with 
643 
cells for 1 h at 37˚C under constant rotation. After 5X PBS washing, cell membranes were 
644 
 21 
 
stained with Deep Red (Life Technology) and cell nuclei with DAPI (Life Technology). 
645 
Confocal images of cells were taken using a Leica SP5 confocal microscope.  
646 
Crystallization and structure determination of HopQAD  
647 
HopQADwas concentrated to 40 mg/mL and crystallized by sitting drop vapor diffusion at 
648 
20°C using 0.12 M alcohols (0.02 M 1,6-Hexanediol; 0.02 M 1-Butanol; 0.0 2M 1,2-
649 
Propanediol; 0.02 M 2-Propanol; 0.02 M 1,4-Butanediol; 0.02 M 1,3-Propanediol), 0.1 M Tris 
650 
(base)/BICINE pH 8.5, 20% v/v PEG 500 MME; 10 % w/v PEG 20000 as a crystallization 
651 
buffer. Crystals were loop-mounted and flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen. Data were collected at 
652 
100 K at beamline Proxima1 (SOLEIL, Gif-sur-Yvette, France) and were indexed, processed 
653 
and scaled using the XDS package49. All crystals were in the P21 space group with 
654 
approximate unit cell dimensions of a=57.7 Å, b=57.7 Å, c=285.7 Å and beta=90.1° and four 
655 
copies of HopQ442 per assymetric unit. Phases were obtained by molecular replacement using 
656 
the BabA structure (PDB:5F7K)21 and the program phaser50,51. The models were refined by 
657 
iterative cycles of manual rebuilding in the graphics program COOT52 and maximum 
658 
likelihood refinement using Refmac5 53. Extended Data Table 2 summarizes the crystal 
659 
parameters, data processing and structure refinement statistics. 
660 
Amino acid sequence alignment 
661 
The amino acid sequence alignment of the N-terminal domains of human, mouse and rat-
662 
CEACAM1 and human CEACAMs (1, 5, 6 and 8) was performed using CLC main 
663 
Workbench (CLC bio). 
664 
Luciferase reporter assays 
665 
CHO-CEACAM1-L cells transfected with various luciferase reporter and control constructs 
666 
(Clontech) were infected with H. pylori for 5 h and analyzed by luciferase assay using the 
667 
Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System according to the manufactures instruction (Promega, 
668 
USA). Briefly, cells were harvested by passive lysis, the protein concentration was measured 
669 
with Precision Red (Cytoskeleton, USA) and the lysates were equalized by adding passive 
670 
lysis buffer. The luciferase activity was measured by using a Plate Luminometer (MITHRAS 
671 
LB940 from Berthold, Germany). 
672 
Animal experiments 
673 
Specific pathogen free, 120-150 g 4 weeks-old male Sprague Dawley rats, were obtained from 
674 
Charles River Laboratories (Sulzfeld, Germany). Animals were randomly distributed into the 
675 
different experimental groups by animal care takers not involved in the experiments, and 
676 
 22 
 
criteria for the exclusion of animals were pre-established. Investigator blinding was 
677 
performed for all assessment of outcome and data, histology was performed by an 
678 
independent investigator in a blinded manner. Animals were challenged twice intragastrically 
679 
in groups of 8 with ~1 x 108 live H. pylori in 2 interval days. After 6 weeks infection, 
680 
stomachs were removed and sectioned. One part was embedded in paraffin for histological 
681 
analysis and another piece was weighted and homogenized to determine colony forming units 
682 
(CFU)/mg stomach. Serial dilutions (1/10, 1/100 and 1/1000) were plated in WC dent plates. 
683 
CFU were counted after 4 days.  
 
684 
The experiments were performed in the specific pathogen-free unit of Zentrum für 
685 
Präklinische Forschung, Klinikum r. d. Isar der TU München, according to the allowance and 
686 
guidelines of the ethical committee and state veterinary office (Regierung von Oberbayern, 
687 
55.2-1.54-2532-160-12). 
688 
Statistical Analysis 
689 
For in vitro experiments, normal distribution was determined by Shapiro–Wilk test. Normally 
690 
distributed data were analyzed with two-tailed Student t-test or One-way ANOVA with post 
691 
hoc Bonferroni test (comparing more than two groups) using Graph Pad Prism Software. Data 
692 
are shown as mean ± s.e.m or S.D. for at least three independent experiments. P values <0.05 
693 
were considered significant. For animal studies, power calculation was performed based on 
694 
previous animal experiments to achieve two sided significance of 0,05 while using lowest 
695 
possible numbers to comply with the ethical guidelines for experimental animals. Mann-
696 
Whitney U test or ANOVA Kruskal-Wallis, Dunn’s multiple comparison test were used to 
697 
determine statistical significances.
