Tandem satellite repeats account for 3% of the human genome. One of them, Human
Satellite II (HSATII), is highly expressed in several epithelial cancers and cancer cell lines.
Here we report an acute induction of HSATII RNA in human cells infected with two herpes
viruses. We show that human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) IE1 and IE2 proteins cooperate to
induce HSATII RNA affecting several aspects of the HCMV replication cycle, viral titers and
infected-cell processes. HSATII RNA expression in tissue from two chronic HCMV colitis
patients correlates with the strength of CMV antigen staining. Thus, endogenous HSATII
RNA synthesis after herpesvirus infections appears to have functionally important con-
sequences for viral replication and may provide a novel insight into viral pathogenesis. The
HSATII induction seen in both infected and cancer cells suggests possible convergence upon
common HSATII-based regulatory mechanisms in these seemingly disparate diseases.

epetitive sequences account for more than 50% of the
human genome with tandem satellite repeats comprising
approximately 3%1. Although repetitive sequences are
ubiquitous, there is a limited understanding of their functions.
Satellite DNA, satDNA, were shown to form centromeric and
pericentromeric loci, and have been implicated in chromosome
organization and segregation, kinetochore formation, and het-
erochromatin
regulation2.
Developments
in
next-generation
sequencing (NSG) showed these genomic sites, previously
thought to be largely transcriptionally inert, could produce RNA
transcripts which contribute to the role of satDNA in chromo-
some and heterochromatin function3.
Human satellite repeat II (HSATII) and its mouse counterpart
(GSAT) were further shown to be highly expressed in several
epithelial cancers but not corresponding normal tissue4,5. While
some satellite repeat transcription was found to be stress-
dependent6 or triggered during cellular apoptosis, differentia-
tion, or senescence7,8; HSATII transcription was refractory to
these generalized environmental stressors and was induced when
cancer cells were grown in non-adherent conditions or as xeno-
grafts in mice9. The sequence motifs of HSATII RNA mimic
specifically some zoonotic viruses by containing CpG motifs
within an AU-rich sequence context. These types of sequences are
vastly under-represented in the human genome, avoided in
viruses10, immune-stimulatory in cells5,11, and sensed by the
antiviral protein ZAP if present in viral RNA12.
Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), like all herpesviruses, cau-
ses a chronic infection with lifelong latency in humans. HCMV is
a leading opportunistic pathogen in immunosuppressed indivi-
duals, with infection capable of causing birth defects13. HCMV
strongly modulates cellular homeostasis for optimal viral repli-
cation and spread, and can be reactivated in the setting of reduced
immunosurveillance13, an immunological feature also observed in
the emergence of cancers14. We therefore sought to determine if
HSATII expression plays a role in virus infections and contributes
to viral fitness.
Our study shows herpesvirus infected cells have drastically
induced HSATII RNA levels. In the case of HCMV, we report
that accumulation of HSATII RNA requires the combined action
of the viral IE1 and IE2 proteins and that HSATII RNA is
important for efficient viral protein expression and localization,
viral replication, and release of infectious particles. Moreover, our
work depicts HSATII RNA as a regulator of several cellular
processes, such as cellular motility, and provides a potential link
between
increased
HSATII
expression
and
virus-mediated
pathobiology in CMV colitis.
Results
HSATII RNA accumulation is induced by herpesvirus infection.
We performed total RNA-seq to capture both coding and non-
coding transcriptomes of acute HCMV infection in human fore-
skin fibroblasts (HFFs) (Supplementary Fig. 1a). With a focus on
non-coding RNAs whose levels changed with infection, we found
the majority of transcripts (74%) were downregulated at 48 hpi,
and this tendency was the most profound for repetitive elements
as 87% of them were decreased in HCMV-infected cells. Of the
13% of repeat elements upregulated upon infection, there was a
striking (≥100-fold) increase of HSATII RNA over that seen in
mock-infected cells (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 1b). Impor-
tantly, the ability to induce HSATII expression was common for
both the HCMV laboratory strain (AD169) and the more clini-
cally relevant isolates (TB40/E and FIX) (Fig. 1a). As HSATII
induction could be an indiscriminate cellular response to any
infection, we tested HSATII expression in the same cell type
infected with two other DNA viruses, herpes simplex virus
(HSV1), an α-herpesvirus, and adenovirus (Ad5). HSV1 increased
HSATII transcript levels to an even greater extent (>1500-fold)
but, interestingly, Ad5 did not alter the expression of the satellite
RNA (Fig. 1a). By analyzing only uniquely mapped HSATII reads
in the RNA-seq dataset, our data suggest that HSATII in infected
cells is produced preferentially from chromosome 1, 2, 10, and 16
and that HSATII accumulation from chromosome 16 was heavily
favored following infection (Fig. 1b)—with the caveat that repeats
often have high genomic diversity, abundant integration sites, and
incomplete annotation. Of note, infected cells seem to have less
diverse HSATII chromosomal expression patterns when com-
pared to primary tumors.
HSATII sequences were found to be often expressed in some
cancers from the chromosome 7 locus15. Our analysis determined
that in tumors a higher percentage of HSATII transcripts also
originated from chromosome 22 as well as other chromosomal
loci (Fig. 1b). However, the preferential expression of HSATII in
infected cells closely aligned with chromosomes where HSATII is
a main constituent of the pericentromere9 and which are largely
responsible for the HSATII expression observed in cancer cells
(Fig. 1b).
To validate our RNA-seq analysis, we designed sets of HSATII-
specific PCR primers (HSATII Set#1–#5) based on highly
expressed transcripts detected in HCMV-infected cells. Analysis
of the kinetics of HSATII transcript accumulation in HCMV-
infected fibroblasts demonstrated an initial induction during the
immediate-early phase of infection at 6 hpi with a continued
increase up to the onset of viral DNA replication at 24 hpi
(Fig. 1c). HSATII levels then decreased, but remained substan-
tially elevated until the end of the viral replication cycle at 96 hpi.
Interestingly, the kinetics of HSATII expression were cell type-
specific. In HCMV-infected ARPE-19 epithelial cells, HSATII
expression was accelerated and reached the maximum at 12 hpi
(Supplementary Fig. 2). HSATII RNA was also induced in
fibroblasts infected with HSV1; but Ad5, as well as several RNA
viruses—influenza A (IAV), ZIKA virus (ZIKV), and hepatitis C
virus (HCV)—failed to induce the probed HSATII sequences
(Fig. 1d), even when close to 100% of cells were infected
(Supplementary Fig. 3). Thus, our data suggest that HSATII
induction might be specific to herpesvirus infections.
The detection of HSATII transcripts required a reverse
transcription step before PCR amplification (Supplementary
Fig. 4), suggesting that HSATII transcripts in HCMV-infected
cells do not create RNA-derived DNA intermediates, as observed
in cancer cells9. Perhaps the rapid HSATII induction or lack of
reverse transcriptase activity in HCMV-infected cells, as opposed
to malignant cells, may prevent the generation of DNA-containing
intermediates. Moreover, in contrast to a control HCMV mRNA,
UL123, HSATII RNA from infected cells was not retained on an
oligo-dT matrix or efficiently amplified from oligo dT-based
cDNA, indicating that it is predominantly not polyadenylated
(Supplementary Fig. 5). The lack of a polyA tail on HSATII
transcripts was confirmed by inspecting unique HSATII reads,
and emphasizes the need for total RNA-sequencing to broadly
explore this phenomena16. HSATII expression was also analyzed
in mock- and HCMV-infected cells using RNA in situ hybridiza-
tion (ISH) for detection of HSATII RNA4. HCMV-infected cells
showed a robust increase in a signal for HSATII RNA with the
majority of signal localized in nuclei (Fig. 1e, f).
HCMV IE1 and IE2 proteins induce HSATII expression. To
determine if just viral attachment and/or entry with the intro-
duction of virion contents to cells could trigger HSATII expres-
sion, we infected cells with replication-competent HCMV or
replication-defective UV-irradiated virus. In comparison to cells

 receiving active virus, HSATII RNA induced by UV-irradiated
virus was reduced by factors of ~1700 and ~100 at 24 and 48 hpi,
respectively, as compared to its expression at 2 hpi (Fig. 2a). As a
control, we showed that levels of a virion protein, pUL82
(pp71), increased following infection with replication-competent
HCMV, but the tegument-delivered protein was degraded after
infection with UV-irradiated virus with no new pUL82 accu-
mulation (Supplementary Fig. 6). These data argue that active
viral gene expression is necessary to induce HSATII expression.
Cycloheximide (CHX) treatment strongly inhibited (33-fold
reduction) HSATII accumulation compared to HCMV-infected
cells treated with a solvent control (Fig. 2b), showing that de novo
protein synthesis is needed to stimulate HSATII transcription.
The viral DNA synthesis inhibitor, ganciclovir (GCV), which
blocks the expression of late viral genes, did not change the
HSATII levels at 24 or 48 hpi (Fig. 2c), arguing that immediate
early (IE) and/or early (E) viral protein expression was sufficient
to induce HSATII accumulation. As a control, accumulation of

 RNA from the late UL99 gene was assayed at 48 hpi, and, as
expected, it was blocked by the drug (Supplementary Fig. 7).
Next, we focused on identifying which IE and/or E viral factor
(s) were responsible for HSATII induction. We initially tested the
viral IE1 and IE2 proteins, because they are known to be
promiscuous transcriptional activators13,17. MRC5 fibroblasts and
ARPE19 epithelial cells were prepared containing tetracycline-
inducible IE1, IE2 or IE1+IE2 cDNAs, and western blot assays
confirmed the induction of the viral proteins (Supplementary
Fig. 8a). Although expression of IE1 or IE2 alone had little effect,
expression of both proteins induced robust HSATII expression in
fibroblasts and epithelial cells (Fig. 2d). The kinetics of HSAII
expression was faster following induction of IE1+IE2-expression
in epithelial cells than in fibroblasts, mimicking the difference
evident in infected cells (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. 2). The
reason for the different kinetics between infected cell types is not
clear. The magnitude of HSATII accumulation in our assays of
IE1+IE2-expressing cells, although substantial, might be under-
estimated. IE1 from protein lysates of IE1+IE2-expressing cells
migrated faster than the protein from infected cells when
subjected to electrophoresis in an SDS-polyacrylamide gel
(Supplementary Fig. 8b), suggesting IE1 produced outside the
context of infection might lack one or more modifications. This
could reduce IE1 transactivation, since posttranslational mod-
ifications are known to affect the activity of IE1 and IE218–20.
Further, the IE2 cDNA used to create IE2-inducible cells carries a
single amino-acid substitution, A463T, which modestly reduces
its transactivation activity compared to wild-type virus21. It is also
possible that additional viral proteins contribute to the rate and
extent of HSATII induction within infected cells. Nevertheless,
IE1 and IE2 clearly act in concert to markedly induce the
accumulation of HSATII transcripts from multiple chromosomal
loci, as they are known to do for mRNA expression13.
HSATII RNA modulates HCMV RNA, proteins, and progeny
levels. To investigate the possible biological role of HSATII
during infection, we utilized locked nucleic acids (LNAs) that
specifically target HSATII transcripts for degradation. The LNAs
did not cause detectable non-specific cellular toxicity (Supple-
mentary Fig. 9). Cells transfected with HSATII-specific LNAs
(HSATII-LNAs) 24 h prior to infection had strongly decreased
HSATII levels (Fig. 3a). RNA-seq analysis revealed that HSATII
transcripts from all chromosomal loci in HCMV-infected cells
were markedly
decreased in HSATII-LNA-transfected
cells
compared with control NT-LNA transfected cells, but little effect
on the low levels of HSATII RNAs was evident in mock-infected
cells (Fig. 3b). Multiple cellular protein-coding transcripts were
increased or decreased following LNA treatment, but no effect on
coding RNA levels was evident in mock-infected cells (Supple-
mentary Fig. 10a), arguing strongly against non-specific effects of
the targeted LNAs. Additionally, HSATII-LNAs were very spe-
cific in downregulating HSATII versus other repeat RNAs (Sup-
plementary Fig. 10b). Besides HSATII RNAs, which as a group
were reduced by a factor of 90, only one simple repeat RNA
[(AATGG)n] was reduced by a factor of five (Supplementary
Fig. 10b). However, this result must be interpreted with caution.
We detected only small number of simple repeat reads, and those
reads might result from self-priming in the PCR amplification
step of the RNA-seq protocol. Further, the simple repeat reads

 might be related to the expression of genes that have those repeats
in their vicinity. Importantly, the (AATGG)n RNA was not
induced by HCMV infection and its expression was not influ-
enced by HSATII-LNAs in mock-infected cells.
We next investigated the effects of LNA-based HSATII
knockdown on the production of extracellular HCMV progeny
in fibroblasts. The ability of two individual HSATII-LNAs or their
combination to efficiently decrease HSATII transcript levels
(Fig. 3a) correlated with their effect on HCMV titer (Supple-
mentary Fig. 11). With the use of both HSATII-LNAs together,
HSATII knockdown reduced the accumulation of infectious virus
at 96 and 120 hpi by a factor of ~8 as compared to controls when
evaluated by TCID50 assay (Fig. 3c and Supplementary Fig. 11).
Ectopically overexpressed HSATII RNA (Fig. 3d, inset) had the
opposite effect, increasing the infectious yield by a factor of ~3.5×
at 96 hpi (Fig. 3d). Together these data reveal that HSATII RNA
supports the production of HCMV progeny.
As virus yield could be affected by perturbations at multiple
steps of the viral replication cycle, we tested the effect of HSATII
knockdown on levels of viral RNA, proteins and genomic DNA
(vDNA) in infected cells. For RNA analysis, we quantified the
expression of representatives from each of the three main classes
of viral genes and HCMV long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs).
qRT-PCR determined HSATII suppression reduced levels of viral
immediate-early (UL123, UL122, UL37x1), early (UL26, UL54),
late (UL69, UL82, UL99), and lncRNAs (RNA4.9, RNA5.0 RNAs)
at 96 hpi (Supplementary Fig. 12). The reduction for each of the
tested RNAs was on the order of 70%. HCMV has a higher GC-
content (~57%)22 than the cell, and viral coding RNAs can have
CpG motif overrepresentation. However, those CpG motifs are
not in a background of AU-rich sequences—as it is the case for
HSATII sequences11, and are unlikely to react with HSATII-
LNAs (Supplementary Fig. 13). Furthermore, RNA-seq analysis
did not detect any significant effect of HSATII-LNAs on
differential
expression
of
HCMV transcripts
at
24 hpi
as
compared to their expression in NT-LNA-treated cells (Supple-
mentary Fig. 10c). Additionally, we did not find any correlation
between the differential expression of HCMV transcripts at 24 hpi
in NT-LNA- and HSATII-LNA-treated fibroblasts and the
sequence similarity of the corresponding HCMV transcript

 sequences and HSATII-LNAs (Supplementary Fig. 14), which
further advocates against off-target effects of the HSATII-LNAs
directed toward HCMV transcripts. In sum, we conclude that the
lower expression levels of multiple HCMV transcripts HSATII-
deficient cells is related to lower HSATII levels in those cells and
are not due to off-target effects of the HSATII-LNAs.
Western blot assays indicated that the level of IE1 protein was
reduced by a factor of 2–3 at each time point examined between
10 and 72 hpi in HSATII knockdown cells, but it reached the
same level as in cells where HSATII was expressed normally by
96 hpi (Fig. 4a). In contrast, IE2 and the early and late viral
proteins accumulated to significantly lower levels at each time

 tested in HSATII-deficient cells. The IE1 protein, which is spread
throughout the nucleus, and the pUL44 subunit of the viral DNA
polymerase, which accumulates in viral replication centers, were
localized normally in HSATII-deficient cells (Fig. 4b). However,
the late pp28 and gB virion proteins, which normally accumulate
in
the
cytoplasmic
assembly
compartment,
were
partially
mislocalized in infected cells lacking HSATII. A portion of each
virion protein was spread through the larger part of cytoplasm
(Fig. 4b and Supplementary Fig. 15). Thus, viral protein levels
mimicked viral RNA levels, and portions of several late proteins
were improperly localized. Consistent with perturbed viral
protein expression and localization, HSATII knockdown reduced
the level of intracellular vDNA to a limited extent (~20%
reduction) at 96 hpi (Fig. 4c).
To further assess the effect of HSATII on virus production, we
monitored the accumulation of intracellular and extracellular
virus at 72 and 96 hpi. When HSATII RNA was knocked down,
infectious virus was reduced in both locations by a factor of ~10
at both times after infection (Fig. 4d). As the viral titer represents
not only the number of viral particles but also their infectivity, we
determined the particle/TCID50 ratio for extracellular viral
particles. By comparing DNase I-resistant vDNA to infectivity,
we found that virions released from HSATII-deficient cells are
less infectious (~2.5-fold) than those from control cells (Fig. 4e).
As a control, we determined that our DNase treatment was
effective in removing unprotected DNA (Supplementary Fig. 16).
Although intracellular DNA was reduced to a limited extent, the
number and infectivity of virions were reduced in the absence of
HSATII RNA, presumably due to perturbations in the levels and
localization of proteins that function during the late phase of
infection.
HSATII RNA alters cellular RNA levels and cell movement. To
investigate the effect of HSATII on infected-cell biology, we uti-
lized RNA-seq to monitor global gene expression of cells treated
with control or HSATII-LNAs. No effect of LNA treatment was
evident in mock-infected cells; in contrast, the levels of multiple
cellular coding RNAs were modulated within infected cells
(Supplementary Fig. 10a). IPA and GSEA analyses of differen-
tially regulated RNAs strongly associated virus-induced HSATII
RNA with the regulation of protein stability and posttranslational
modifications, and particularly with cellular movement (Fig. 5a
and Supplementary Fig. 17). Cells treated with HSATII-LNAs
exhibited decreased expression of RNAs including ADAM12,
TCF7L2, PLAGL1, SLIT3, DIO2, and LPP, as well as increased
levels of CXCL1, CXCL8, MMP1, MMP3, STC1, and CTSS
(Fig. 5a). Of note, the latter genes are associated with inflam-
mation and oncogenesis23, thus our results provide additional
support for a role of HSATII RNA in immune regulation and
cancer progression as discussed above for tumor cells.
As noted above, reduced HSATII RNA levels in infected cells
modulated the expression of genes associated with cell movement.
HCMV is known to modulate the motility of multiple cell
types24–28, a phenotype with the potential to influence both
HCMV spread and latency within its infected host24,29. Since
HCMV triggers high levels of HSATII RNA in epithelial cells
(Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 2), a cell type playing an
important role in HCMV pathogenesis30 and the wound healing
process31, we asked if modulating HSATII RNA levels would lead
to changes in wound closure or migration of infected epithelial
cells. A wound-healing assay32 revealed that HCMV-infected cells
lacking high HSATII levels were much slower in closing wounds
compared to uninfected cells, and this effect was even more
pronounced when compared to infected cells with normal, high
levels of HSATII RNA (Fig. 5b). A transwell migration assay
confirmed that cells characterized by a low HSATII RNA level
were also less mobile (~4×) than HCMV-infected cells with a
highly induced HSATII expression (Fig. 5c). Our preliminary
data showed that transfection efficiency for exogenous expression
of HSATII was too low in epithelial cells preventing the
assessment of results from the wound healing and transwell
migration assays. Overall, our experimental results are consistent
with the possibility that HSATII induction promotes a transcrip-
tional environment permissive for cell movement.
HSATII RNA is elevated in CMV colitis. A hallmark of severe
HCMV infection is the involvement of multiple organs33. Infec-
tion of the gastrointestinal tract may lead to the onset of CMV
colitis, which in rare cases of immunocompetent individuals
resembles gastroenteritis and in patients with a compromised
immune system is the second most frequent outcome of CMV
disease after CMV retinitis34,35. We used RNA ISH4 to evaluate
the levels of HSATII RNA in normal colon epithelium versus
tissue biopsies from two patients manifesting low or high grade of
CMV colitis. Low versus high grade was based on a standard
immunohistochemical (IHC) assay staining IE and E CMV
antigens (CCH2-UL44/DDG9-IE)36,37 or the IHC assay specifi-
cally staining HCMV IE2 protein (Fig. 5d and Supplementary
Fig. 18). We noticed that the latter staining method seemed to be
more sensitive (Fig. 5d and Supplementary Fig. 18). To our
knowledge, IHC staining of colitis samples with the use of our IE2
antibodies38 is a novel approach and was utilized after we
determined that HCMV IE1 and IE2 proteins work cooperatively
in inducing HSATII RNA (Fig. 2d). At this point, we can only
speculate that IE2 antibody might possess better binding char-
acteristics for IHC staining in our tested samples. As with
uninfected fibroblasts (Fig. 1e), normal colon epithelium was
negative for HSATII-specific signal (Fig. 5d). We observed a
concordance between the level of CMV infection based on
detection of viral proteins by IHC and the strength of the HSATII
RNA signal (Fig. 5d and Supplementary Fig. 18).
Identifying patients with CMV colitis is rare given the
challenging diagnosis. Our very limited patient population
prevents us from making a strong conclusion about HSATII
involvement in the pathogenesis of CMV colitis. Nevertheless, as
we determined that HCMV IE1 and IE2 proteins cooperate to
induce HSATII expression (Fig. 2d), the positive staining for IE2
protein in colitis samples is consistent with the possibility that
elevated levels of HSATII could result from regulation by viral
proteins in this tissue as well. Moreover, these results lead us to
speculate that elevated HSATII RNA may either directly affect the
development of CMV colitis or influence the disease by
augmenting HCMV replication in the tissue. More work is
needed to address these intriguing questions, but to our
knowledge, our report is the first documentation of elevated
HSATII RNA in likely virally infected tissue.
Discussion
There are a number of striking similarities between chronic virus-
infected cells and cancerous cells. These include manipulative and
evasive interactions with the innate and adaptive immune system,
metabolic changes and changes in cell division to provide sub-
strates for replication, epigenetic alterations in cells to promote
viral replication or cancer cell spreading, and extensive commu-
nication between cells and tissues. The induction of HSATII RNA
synthesis in virus-infected cells and many cancers appears to
utilize all of these altered cellular processes1,4,5,9 for the benefit of
the fitness of the cancer cells or the virus. HSATII RNA can
affect the innate immune system inducing the synthesis of IL-6
and TNF-alpha11. HSATII RNA and some viruses (i.e., Avian

 Influenza A) share RNA nucleotide motifs that appear to be
recognized by components of the innate immune system (such as
ZAP12,39) or pattern recognition receptors11 and this can result in
evolutionary selection pressures that change the viral genome
sequences with time and replication10,40. The results presented
here document the role of HSATII in cellular motility that could
enhance the fitness of both the virus and cancer cells in the
environment of the host.
CpG motifs in HIV1 RNA have negative effects on viral
infection12. In contrast, HCMV, another chronic human virus
implicated in oncomodulation41–43, induces endogenous repeated
CpG-rich transcripts that mimic those found in zoonotic, non-
mammalian viruses. As previous work argues that HSATII
expression provides a positive fitness advantage for tumors9,15,16,
we believe both cancers and chronic DNA viruses are specifically
utilizing this RNA species to their selective advantage. A tumor
upregulating HSATII would therefore be engaging in genuine
viral mimicry by evolving to induce specific features of viruses
foreign to humans to gain an evolutionary advantage, as opposed
to inducing non-specific generic features of RNA viruses, such as

 long dsRNA, to its disadvantage as a possible consequence of
epigenetic stress. The shared ability of at least some herpesviruses
and cancers to utilize this particular RNA repeat is an intriguing
example of convergent evolution mechanism in these seemingly
disparate biological settings. As our study has not found the
virus-induced HSATII expression beyond herpesvirus family, it is
intriguing to speculate that our mechanistic work, documenting
HCMV IE1 and IE2 proteins working cooperatively to induce
high HSATII RNA levels in fibroblasts and epithelial cells toge-
ther with the IE2 staining seen in CMV colitis biopsies, may
provide another regulatory layer to the processes important in
pathology of diseases associated with some herpesviruses, such as
colitis, retinitis, encephalitis, pneumonia, hepatitis, cancer44,45,
and diseases (i.e., Alzheimer’s disease) recently linked to her-
pesvirus infection46–48. As an increasing body of evidence sug-
gests HCMV could be categorized as an oncomodulatory
virus42,49,50, we hypothesize virus-induced HSATII as an onco-
modulatory factor. Our observations provide a new framework—
viral infection—for further investigation of the role of this family
of non-coding RNAs in human inflammatory disease.
Methods
Ethics statement. Colon samples were analyzed under a Partners/MGH IRB
approved protocol 2016P002541. This is a discarded tissue protocol with minimal
risk to patients.
Cells, viruses, and reagents. Human lung fibroblasts (MRC-5), human dermal
fibroblasts (HDF; immortalized by expressing SV40 large T antigen), and human
retinal pigment epithelial (ARPE-19) cells51 were from the American Type Culture
Collection (ATCC). HCV-infected Huh7.5 cells (A gift of Dr. Charles M. Rice,
Rockefeller University) are from Ploss lab (Princeton University). Primary HFFs
and other fibroblasts were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagles Medium
(DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (10% FBS/DMEM) (Sigma-
Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). HFFs were used at passages 8–13. ARPE19 cells were
cultured with added Ham’s F-12 nutrient mixture (Sigma-Aldrich). 100 units ml−1
of penicillin (Sigma-Aldrich) and 95 µg ml−1 of streptomycin (Thermo Fisher
Scientific, Waltham, MA) were added to media.
To construct IE1 and IE2 expressing cell lines, cDNAs encoding 72 kDa IE1 (IE-
72) and 86 kDa IE2 (IE-86) from strain Towne were PCR amplified from pLXSN-
IE152 and pLXSN-IE2, respectively. The IE2 cDNA contains missense mutations at
methionine 242 (M242I), eliminating the internal start responsible for generating
the 40 kDa IE2-40 protein53, and alanine 463 (A463T), which reduces IE2’s
transactivation activity by about 50%21. A cDNA of monomeric EGFP was
subcloned from a derivative of pEGFP-N3 (Clonetech) containing the mutation
A206K54. Tetracycline-inducible cell lines expressing IE1, IE2, or EGFP were
created by inserting each cDNA into pLVX-TetOne-Puro (Clonetech), producing
VSV-G pseudotyped lentivirus particles in 293FT cells, concentrating lentivirus
particles by ultracentrifugation over a 20% sorbitol cushion, and transducing MRC-
5 or ARPE-19 cells. Stable cell lines were selected for 1 week in the presence of
puromycin. Dual IE1 and IE2 expressing cells were created by cloning Towne IE2
into a derivative of pTetOne-Puro where the endogenous SV40-promoter-
puromycin cassette was removed and a porcine teshovirus 2A-Neomycin
geneblock (P2A-Neomycin) was inserted on the 3-prime-end of the reverse-
Tetracycline transactivator (rtTA). Lentivirus particles were prepared as above.
Stable lines were generated by co-transducing IE1 and IE2 lentivirus particles and
selecting for 1 week in the presence of puromycin and G418.
Two GFP-tagged viruses derived from clinical isolates, TB40/E-GFP55,56, FIX-
GFP57, a GFP-tagged laboratory strain AD169-GFP58, as well as untagged TB40/E
were used in these studies. TB40-epi designates the TB40/E strain grown in ARPE-
19 cells59. Viruses were produced from BAC clones transfected with pp71
expression plasmid into HFFs, MRC-5, or ARPE-19 cells to generate viral progeny
of wild-type growth characteristics58. Viruses were purified by centrifugation
through a sorbitol cushion (20% sorbitol, 50 mM Tris–HCl,1 mM MgCl2, pH 7.2),
concentrated and resuspended in DMEM. Viral titers were determined using a
tissue culture infectious dose 50 (TCID50) assay on HFFs or ARPE-19 cells, and
infections were performed at a multiplicity of 3 TCID50/cell or as designated. UV-
inactivation of TB40/E-GFP virions was performed by 4 sequential UV irradiations
of viral inoculum using Auto Cross Link settings (UV Stratalinker 2400; San Diego,
CA).
HSV-1 strain F60 was kindly provided by B. Roizman (University of Chicago)
and grown in Vero cells. Pooling cell-associated virus, obtained by sonication, with
cell-free virus, produced viral stocks. HSV-1 titers were determined using TCID50
assay. Fibroblasts were infected with HSV1 at a multiplicity 3 TCID50/cell.
Adenovirus (Ad5) was kindly provided by S. J. Flint (Princeton University). Ad5
titer was determined on MRC-5 cells by a focus forming assay and is expressed as
focus forming units (FFU). Fibroblasts were infected with Ad5 at a multiplicity 10
FFU/cell. Influenza A virus [IAV; A/PR/8/1934(H1N1) (ATCC)] titer was
determined using TCID50 assay. HFFs were infected with IAV at a multiplicity 3
TCID50/cell in Flu infection buffer [DMEM containing 0.2% BSA, 1 μg/ml L-1-
tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-treated trypsin (Thermo
Fisher Scientific) and 0.1% FBS]. Zika virus (ZIKV; ZIKV/1947/UG/MR766) titer
was determined using a plaque assay. HDFs were infected with ZIKV at a
multiplicity 10 PFU/cell. Hepatitis C Virus (HCV; JCI strain expressing Cre
recombinase) titer was determined on Huh-7.5 cells using TCID50 assay. Huh-7.5
cells were infected with HCV at a multiplicity 1 TCID50/cell.
Following a 2-h absorption period for all viruses, inoculum was removed, cells
were washed twice with complete medium, and collected at indicated time points
post infection. When indicated, experimental HCMV viral titers were also
determined by assaying for IE1-positive cells on reporter plates61.
To measure the portion of cells within a culture that were infected, fibroblasts
were fixed with methanol and stained using mouse antibodies anti-HCMV IE1
(1B12; 1:100 dilution), anti-HSV ICP4 (1:10 dilution)62, anti-Ad5 E2 (DBP; B6;
1:50 dilution)63, anti-IAV nucleoprotein (HB-65; 1:50 dilution), or anti-Flavivirus
Group Antigen Antibody (D1-4G2-4-15; 1:10 dilution; Sigma, cat.# MAB10216)
and goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor-488 conjugated secondary antibody (1:1000
dilution; Invitrogen, cat.# A11029). Nuclei were counterstained with Hoechst
33342. Cells were visualized and the percentage of viral antigen-positive cells was
calculated from at least 20 fields of view using the Operetta high-content imaging
and analysis system (PerkinElmer).
Cyclohexamide (Sigma-Aldrich) and ganciclovir (Sigma-Aldrich) were
dissolved in DMSO and used at 100 μg ml−1 or 50 µM concentrations, respectively.
Doxycycline (Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in water and used at 2 μg ml−1.
Puromycin was dissolved in water and used at 1.5 µg ml−1 (MRC-5) or 2 µg ml−1
(ARPE-19). G418 was dissolved in water and used at 800 µg ml−1 (MRC-5) or
1 mg ml−1 G418 (ARPE-19).

DNase (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and RNA quality was analyzed using the Bioa-
nalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). cDNA sequencing libraries
were prepared by the Penn State College of Medicine Genome Sciences Facility
using the TruSeq Stranded Total RNA with Ribo-Zero kit (Illumina, San Diego,
CA) for rRNA depletion, and subjected to multiplexed sequencing (RNA-seq)
using Rapid HiSeq2500 sequencer (Illumina) for 100 cycles in paired-end, rapid
mode (2 × 100 bp).
RNA-seq data was de-multiplexed based on indexes and raw Illumina reads
were quality filtered as follows. First, ends of the reads were trimmed to remove N’s
and bases with quality less than 20. After that the quality scores of the remaining
bases were sorted and the quality at the 20th percentile was computed. If the
quality at the 20th percentile was less than 15, the whole read was discarded. Also,
reads shorter than 40 bases after trimming were discarded. If at least one of the
reads in the pair failed the quality check and had to be discarded, we discarded the
mate as well. Human, HCMV, HSV1, and Ad5 fasta and annotation (.gtf) files were
created for mapping by combining sequences and annotations from Ensembl
annotation, build 37, repbase elements (release 19) and TB40/E (EF999921.1), FIX
(GU179289), AD169 (FJ5275630), HSV1 (GU734771), or Ad5 (AC000008) when
appropriate. To that created concatenated human-virus genomes, quality filtered
reads were mapped using STAR aligner64. Aligned reads were assigned to genes
using the featureCounts function of Rsubread package65 with the external Ensembl
annotations66. This produced the raw read counts for each gene. Gene expression
in terms of log2-CPM (counts per million reads) was computed and normalized
across samples using the trimmed mean of M-values method (TMM)67, as
implemented in the calcNormFactors function of edgeR package68. Differential
expression analysis was performed using limma package69,70. Expression data were
used in conjunction with the weights computed by the voom transformation71.
To calculate the percent of HSATII reads originating from each chromosome in
infected cells and in selected samples from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we
identified uniquely mapped reads that exclusively overlapped with HSATII repeat.
The number of normalized counts of HSATII reads mapped to each chromosome
was computed. Next, the percentage of these reads mapping to each chromosome
was calculated by dividing their number by the total number of HSATII reads and
multiplying by 100%. We only considered samples with at least 100 HSATII reads.
TCGA samples were comprised of 12 LUAD (lung adenocarcinoma), 10 COAD
(colon adenocarcinoma), 5 BRCA (breast invasive carcinoma), 4 KIRC (kidney
renal clear cell carcinoma), 4 UCEC (uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma), and 3
BLCA (bladder urothelial carcinoma) tumors.
Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was also used to investigate the data set
overlap with annotated gene sets comprising the Molecular Signature Database
(MSigDB). A matrix of differentially expressed genes from the data set significantly
matching identified MSigDB gene sets were composed and ordered based on a
number of overlapping genes, P value determining the probability of association
with a given gene set and a false discovery rate q-value.
For quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis, cells were
collected in QIAzol Lysis Reagent (Qiagen). To fractionate RNA, DNA, and
proteins, chloroform was added; samples were spun at 12,000×g for 15 min at 4 °C.
RNA from an aqueous layer was isolated using the miRNeasy Mini kit (QIAGEN)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA samples were stored at −80 °C.
DNA contaminants were removed from the samples using the TURBO® DNase Kit
(Invitrogen by Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. cDNA was made using random hexamers (Invitrogen by Thermo
Fisher Scientific) and Superscript™III Reverse Transcriptase Kit (Invitrogen by
Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed using SYBR Green master mix (Applied
Biosystems by Thermo Fisher Scientific, Foster City, CA) on the QuantStudio 6
Flex-Real Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems by Thermo Fisher Scientific). For
a semiquantitative PCR, product amplification was carried out using PTC-225
thermocycler (MJ Research Inc., BioRad Laboratories), with the following PCR
mix: 10× PCR Reaction Buffer with MgCl2 (Roche), 1.25 units of Taq DNA
Polymerase (Roche) and a 200 μM concentration of each deoxynucleotide (Thermo
Fisher Scientific). The performance of HSATII-specific primer sets was tested for
uniformity and consistency across serially diluted cDNA sample and show a high
level of linearity during amplification (Supplementary Fig. 19a–e).
Primer sequences used in qRT-PCR reactions are listed in Supplementary
Table 1. Transcript levels were analyzed using the ΔΔCt method and GAPDH or
B2M were used as an internal control72. Data are presented as a fold change mean
± SD. The unpaired, two-tailed t-tests were performed and P value was used to
measure a statistical significance between samples.
Protein analysis. Cells were either harvested using protein lysis buffer [50 mM
Tris–HCl at pH 7.5 (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 5 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid (EDTA; Thermo Fisher Scientific), 100 mM sodium chloride (Thermo Fisher
Scientific), 1% Triton X-100 (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 0.1% sodium dodecyl
sulfate (SDS; Roche), and 10% glycerol (Sigma)] or Trizol. If Trizol was used, upon
RNA/DNA/protein fractionation and the removal of RNA and DNA fractions,
proteins were precipitated by adding 2-propanol. After pelleting proteins at
12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, the pellet was washed with of 0.3 M GuHCl/95%
EtOH, washed with 100% EtOH, resuspended in 1:1 1% SDS:8 M urea/1 M tris
(hydroxymethyl) aminomethane (Tris) and sonicated. Protein samples were stored
at −80 °C. Protein samples were mixed with 6× SDS sample buffer (325 mM Tris
pH 6.8, 6% SDS, 48% glycerol, 0.03% bromophenol blue) containing 9% 2-
mercaptoethanol (Sigma). Proteins were separated by electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)
and transferred to ImmunoBlot polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes
(BioRad Laboratories). Western blot analyses were performed using mouse
monoclonal antibodies anti-IE1 (1B12; 1:500 dilution)73, anti-IE2 (3A9; 1:500
dilution), anti-pUL26 (7H1-5; 1:100 dilution)74, pUL44 (CMV ICP36; 1:80,000
dilution; Virusys; Taneytown, MD; cat.# CA006), anti-pUL69 (10E11; 1:100 dilu-
tion)75, anti-pUL82 (10G11; 1:100 dilution)76, anti-pUL99 (10B4-29; 1:100 dilu-
tion), anti-GFP (1:1400 dilution; Sigma; cat.# 11814460001) and anti-β-actin-HRP
(1:100,000 dilution; Abcam; cat.# ab49900). Goat anti-mouse antibody (1:10,000
dilution; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc.; cat.# 115-035-003) con-
jugated with horseradish peroxidase was used as secondary antibodies. Western
blots were developed using WesternSure ECL Detection Reagents (Licor). The
uncropped images of western blots are shown in the Supplementary Fig. 20.
Immunofluorescence. Infected cells were fixed and stained for viral proteins:
HCMV (IE1, ppUL44, p28 or gB), HSV1 (ICP4), Ad5 (DBP), IAV (NP) or ZIKV
(the flavivirus antigen) and nuclei were counterstained with the Hoechst stain.
Cells were visualized using either Nikon Ti-E confocal microscope (Nikon
Instruments Inc.) with spinning disc, 30× or 60× magnification and Z-stack mode,
or the Operetta high-content imaging system (PerkinElmer; Waltham, MA) with
20× magnification.
DNA analysis. Cells were harvested and DNA was isolated using the DNA Blood
& Tissue Kit (Qiagen). Intracellular viral DNA was quantified from total intra-
cellular DNA. Extracellular viral DNA was isolated from sample media collected at
96 hpi. Media was treated with 30 units of DNase I (Invitrogen by Thermo Fisher
Scientific, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Vir-
ions in the media were lysed and isolated using the DNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN,
Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
vDNA and cellular DNA copy numbers were determined based on standard
curves of viral genomic UL44 (Forward: 5′-GTGCGCGCCCGATTTCAATATG-3′,
Reverse: 5′-GCTTTCGCGCACAATGTCTTGG-3′) or cellular genomic GAPDH
(Forward: 5′-CCCCACACACATGCACTTACC-3′, Reverse: 5′-CCTAGTCCC
AGGGCTTTGATT-3′) amplified from serially diluted HCMV TB40-BAC4 DNA
or pUC18-gGAPDH DNA, respectively. Data are presented as a fold change mean
± SD. Student’s t-test was performed and P value was used to measure a statistical
significance between samples.
HSATII RNA knockdown. Locked nucleic acid (LNA™; Exiqon, Skelstedt, Denmark)
oligonucleotides were designed to target identified, highly abundant HSATII tran-
scripts from different chromosomal loci. The most effective LNA™s: HSATII-LNA #1
(5′-CCATTCGATAATTCCG-3′), HSATII-LNA #2 (5′-GATTCCATTCGATGAT-
3′), or a mixture of both HSATII-LNAs (#1 + #2) were used for experiments as
indicated. Lipofectamine RNAiMAX® Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham,
MA) and LNAs were resuspended in Opti-MEM® medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The final LNA concentration applied to
cells was 100–200 nM. Non-target scrambled sequence LNA (NT-LNA; 5′-AACACG
TCTATACGC-3′) was used as a negative control. HFFs and ARPE-19 cells were
incubated for 24 h before being mock- or HCMV-infected. Cells were collected at the
indicated time post-infection using QIAzol buffer (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) and
stored at −80 °C until sample processing.
Plasmid transfection. HFFs at 70% confluency were transfected with 1 µg of
pcDNA3.1 (Addgene) or pcDNA-HSATII (a generous gift of Arnold Levine) using
X-tremeGENE 9 DNA Transfection Reagent (Roche) according to the manu-
facturer’s instructions. 24 h later, plasmid-transfected cells were infected with
TB40/E-GFP at a multiplicity of 3 TCID50/cell. Media and RNA samples were
collected at 96 hpi and stored at −80 °C.
Cell migration assays. To perform wound healing assays, confluent monolayers of
NT-LNA- or HSATII-LNA-transfected ARPE-19 cells were infected with TB40-epi
at a multiplicity of 3 TCID50/cell or were mock infected. At 2 hpi, cells were washed
to remove inoculum and scratching the cell monolayer with 1-ml pipet created
wounds. The process of wound closure was monitored in time and pictures of
wounds were taken using the Nikon Eclipse TE2000-U inverted microscope. The
average wound width (in arbitrary units) of ARPE-19 cells was calculated from the
captured images using ImageJ software77. Results are plotted as a percent of
remaining wound width mean ± SD.
To perform transwell migration assay, NT-LNA- or HSATII-LNA-transfected
ARPE-19 cells were infected with TB40-epi at a multiplicity of 3 TCID50/cell or mock-
infected. At 6 hpi, cells were trypsinized and 5 × 104 cells were seeded onto each filter
in FBS-free medium containing ITS Liquid Media Supplement (Sigma-Aldrich). After
24 h at 37 °C/5% CO2, filters were washed with 1× PBS and fixed in methanol. Non-

 migrated cells were removed with a cotton swab, and nuclei of migrated cells on the
bottom surface of the filter were stained with Hoechst 33342 and were imaged by the
Nikon Eclipse TE2000-U inverted microscope. Migrated cell number was quantified
from the captured images using ImageJ software77. Results are plotted as a fold change
mean ± SD of average cell number per field of view (FOV).
RNA in situ hybridization (ISH) assay. To analyze HSATII levels in HCMV-
infected cells, HFFs were infected with HCMV at a multiplicity of 1 TCID50/cell or
mock-infected. At 24 hpi, cells were collected, washed with 1× PBS and resus-
pended in human plasma (Sigma-Aldrich). To facilitate sample coagulation, 13
NIH units of thrombin (Sigma-Aldrich) were added to each sample. Cells were
then fixed in 10% formaldehyde for 4 h. The fixed pellets were transferred to biopsy
cassettes. Automated ISH assays for HSATII RNA was performed using the
ViewRNA eZ-L Detection Kit (Affymetrix by Thermo Fisher Scientific) on the
BOND RX IHC and ISH Staining System with BDZ 6.0 software (Leica Biosystems
Inc., Buffalo Grove, IL). Cell pellets were formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded
(FFPE) and cut in 5-µm sections on slides and processed automatically from
deparaffinization, through ISH staining and hematoxylin counterstaining. Auto-
matic coverslipper (Leica Biosystems) was used for coverslipping slides. Briefly,
slides were baked for 1 h at 60 °C, and placed on the BOND RX for processing. The
BOND RX user-selectable settings were the ViewRNA ez-L Detection 1-plex (Red)
protocol and ViewRNA Dewax1; ViewRNA HIER2 (90) 5 min; ViewRNA Enzyme
2 (5 min); ViewRNA Probe Hybridization 3 h. With these settings, the RNA
unmasking conditions for the tissue consisted of a 5-min incubation at 90 °C in
Bond Epitope Retrieval Solution 2 (Leica Biosystems) followed by 5-min incuba-
tion with Proteinase K from the BOND Enzyme Pretreatment Kit at 1:1000 dilu-
tion (Leica Biosystems). The HSATII RNA-targeting Probe (Affymetrix; Cat #VA1-
10874; probe sequence: ATCATCGAATGGAATCGAATG) was diluted 1:40 in
ViewRNA Probe Diluent (Affymetrix) for use on the automated platform. Diluted
Probe Set, diluted Proteinase K, and ViewRNA eZ-L Detection Kit were loaded
onto BOND RX prior to starting the run. After the run, post rinsing with water and
drying for 30 min at room temperature, slides were dipped in xylene, and mounted
using HistoMount solution (Life Technologies by Thermo Fisher Scientific).
HSATII signal from ISH experiments was quantified based on the ratio of HSATII
signal area to cell area using BDZ 6.0 software.
To analyze HSATII levels in human biopsies of HCMV colitis, normal colon
and two CMV positive colitis biopsies were analyzed. It is of note that identifying
these patients is complicated and rare given the difficulty in the diagnosis of CMV
colitis. Both patients had ulcerative colitis on immunosuppressive medications
predisposing them to CMV infection. The diagnosis was made with biopsy of the
colon and immunohistochemistry analysis performed by a board-certified
anatomic pathologist. Immunohistochemical expression of the CMV was evaluated
by deparaffinizing FFPE sections by baking them for 1 h at 60 °C. IHC staining was
done on the BondRx using the BOND Polymer Refine Detection kit (Catalogue No.
DS9800). Antigen retrieval was carried out with citrate buffer at pH 6 for 10 min
using Bond Epitope Retrieval Solution 1 (Leica Biosystems). Mouse monoclonal
antibodies against HCMV (antibody mixture to infected cell lysate, clone CCH2
+DDG9, Sigma-Aldrich); HCMV IE2 (clone 3H9)78 were diluted in BondTM
Primary Antibody Diluent (Leica Biosystems Inc.) and signal was detected by the
Polymer Refine Kit (Leica Biosystems Inc.) and protocol F on a Leica Bond Rx
Autostainer. Automated ISH assay for HSATII RNA was performed as described
for HCMV-infected fibroblasts.
Statistical analysis. To determine statistical significance among samples in
experiments, unpaired, two-tailed t-tests were performed between the arrays of
data from distinct samples to determine P values. P value < 0.05 was considered
significant. The significance is shown by the presence of asterisks above data points
with one, two, three or four asterisks representing P < 0.05, P < 0.01, P < 0.001, or
P < 0.0001, respectively. Only significant P values are reported.
