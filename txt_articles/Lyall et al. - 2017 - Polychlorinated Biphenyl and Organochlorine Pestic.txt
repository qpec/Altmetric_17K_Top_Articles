Introduction
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a 
neurodevelopmental condition defined 
by presence of restricted, repetitive behav-
iors and deficits in social communication. 
Intellectual disability, a condition commonly 
co-occurring in ASD, is defined by impair-
ments in general mental abilities and 
adaptive functioning (American Psychiatric 
Association 1994). Evidence supports a role 
for both genetic and environmental factors 
in the etiology of ASD and neurodevelop-
ment more broadly (Antonelli et al. 2016; 
Hallmayer et al. 2011; Newschaffer et al. 
2007), and emerging work points to environ-
mental toxicants that have the ability, either 
directly or indirectly, to alter neurodevelop-
ment during critical time periods in gestation 
(Braun et al. 2014; Cheslack-Postava et al. 
2013; Grandjean and Landrigan 2014; Lyall 
et al. 2014; Rice and Barone 2000). One 
such class of toxicants is the organochlorine 
compounds (OCCs). These chemicals have 
the ability to cross the placenta (Wolff and 
Landrigan 2002) and influence a number 
of pathways previously implicated in ASD 
and neuro 
development, including endocrine 
disruption, and effects on immune, repro-
ductive, and nervous systems (Bell 2014; 
Chevrier et al. 2008; Hertz-Picciotto et al. 
2008; Kimura-Kuroda et al. 2007; Shelton 
et al. 2012).
Polychlorinated biphenyl ethers (PCBs) 
and organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) are two 
classes of OCCs that have been designated 
as persistent organic pollutants (POPs). As 
a result of health concerns, these chemicals 
were banned in the 1970s in the United 
States and other countries. Due to their lipo-
philic nature, OCCs have bioaccumulated 
in the food chain, and levels are still measur-
able in blood samples today, including those 
from pregnant women, as well as in breast 
milk samples (Sjödin et al. 2014; Woodruff 
et al. 2011). Currently, the primary source 
of exposure to the general population in the 
United States is through the consumption of 
fatty foods (CDC 2009).
Although both PCBs and OCPs have 
known adverse effects on neurodevelopment 
(Korrick and Sagiv 2008; Ribas-Fitó et al. 
2001; Rosas and Eskenazi 2008), only a few 
studies have examined prenatal exposure in 
association with risk of ASD specifically. A 
nonsignificant association for total prenatal 
PCB exposure was suggested in one small 
pilot study (Cheslack-Postava et al. 2013), 
while conflicting findings were reported 
for gestational exposure to PCBs and other 
endocrine-disrupting chemicals in associa-
tion with autistic behaviors in another small 
study (Braun et al. 2014). A few additional 
studies have more indirectly suggested asso-
ciations between ASD and exposure to these 
chemicals, as estimated by parental occupa-
tions, proximity to agricultural organochlorine 
pesticide use, or postnatal exposures (Felicetti 
1981; Roberts et al. 2007; Rossignol et al. 
2014; Windham et al. 2013). A number of 
investigations have examined OC exposure 
in association with a range of cognitive and 
developmental outcome measures, as reviewed 
elsewhere (Jurewicz et al. 2013), though work 
examining the diagnosis of ID (intellectual 
disability without autism) is limited. Thus, 
sufficiently powered studies examining ASD 
and ID risk in association with OCC exposure 
using biosamples collected during develop-
mentally relevant time periods are lacking, 
leading us to conduct the current analyses.

Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia, USA
Background: Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) are 
neurodevelopmental toxicants, but few studies have examined associations with autism spectrum 
disorder (ASD).
oBjectives: We aimed to determine whether prenatal exposure to PCBs and OCPs influences 
offspring risk of ASD and intellectual disability without autism (ID).
Methods: We conducted a population-based case–control study among Southern California 
births, including children with ASD (n = 545) meeting Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental 
Disorders, 4th Edition (DSM-IV-TR) criteria and ID (n = 181), as well as general population (GP) 
controls (n = 418). Concentrations of 11 PCB congeners and 2 OCPs measured in banked second-
trimester serum samples were compared between the diagnostic groups. Logistic regression was 
used to calculate crude and adjusted odds ratios (AOR) for associations with ASD, and separately 
for ID, compared with GP controls, by quartiles of analyte concentrations in primary analyses.
results: Geometric mean levels of several PCB congeners were higher in the ASD group than 
in the ID and GP groups. ASD risk was elevated for a number of PCB congeners, particularly for 
the highest vs. lowest quartile of PCB138/158 (AOR = 1.79; 95% CI: 1.10, 2.71) and PCB153 
(AOR = 1.82; 95% CI: 1.10, 3.02), and for highest deciles of other congeners in secondary analyses. 
PCB138/158 was also associated with increased ID (AOR = 2.41; 95% CI: 1.18, 4.91), though no 
trend was suggested. OCPs were not associated with increased risk of ASD in primary analyses, 
whereas nonmonotonic increases in risk of ID were found with p,p´-DDE.
conclusions: Our results suggest higher levels of some organochlorine compounds during 
pregnancy are associated with ASD and ID.

 Prenatal organochlorine chemicals and autism

Methods
Study Population
Details of the Early Markers for Autism 
(EMA) study have been previously described 
(Croen et al. 2008). Briefly, EMA is a 
 
population- 
based case–control study designed 
to identify biologic markers of autism that 
uses archived prenatal and newborn blood 
samples from California statewide screening 
programs. The EMA study population was 
drawn from live-born children in three 
counties from Southern California (Orange, 
San Diego, and Imperial) in 2000–2003 
whose mothers were enrolled in the state’s 
Expanded Alphafetoprotein Prenatal Screening 
Program. Only mother–child pairs for whom 
both maternal prenatal and newborn screening 
blood specimens were available were eligible 
for inclusion. Study activities were approved 
by the California State Committee for the 
Protection of Human Subjects; it was deter-
mined at the CDC that the agency was not 
engaged in human subjects research. 
Information from the California 
Department of Developmental Services 
(DDS), which provides services to individ-
uals with autism, intellectual disability, and 
other developmental disabilities, was used 
to create three study groups: children with 
ASD, children with ID, and general popula-
tion (GP) controls. ID cases did not include 
those of known etiology (e.g., chromosomal 
abnormalities). Following exclusion of DDS 
clients, GP controls were randomly sampled 
from prenatal screening program linked birth 
certificates, matching to ASD cases on sex, 
birth month, and birth year.
Diagnostic Verification
The records of children with ASD and ID 
identified from DDS were obtained and 
reviewed by trained medical record abstrac-
tors. Following a protocol originally developed 
by the Metropolitan Atlanta Developmental 
Disabilities Surveillance Program (Yeargin-
Allsopp et al. 2003), final case status was 
determined by expert clinical review of these 
diagnostic and clinical data. A final study clas-
sification of ASD was given if DSM-IV-TR 
(Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental 
Disorders, 4th Edition, Text Revision) criteria 
were met; ASD cases were further qualified 
by presence or absence of co-occurring intel-
lectual disability (here defined as for final clas-
sification of ID, but in the presence of ASD 
symptoms, yielding 287 ASD children with 
comorbid intellectual disability, 221 ASD 
children without intellectual disability, and 
37 ASD children who did not have informa-
tion available to make this classification). Final 
classification of ID was based on standardized 
test score results found in records (composite 
score on cognitive and functional tests < 70) 
in the absence of ASD symptoms. Expert 
clinician review identified 132 individuals 
from among those originally identified as ID 
in the DDS system as meeting ASD criteria, 
and they were therefore reclassified as ASD 
cases. By definition no GP control children 
were being served by DDS.
Specimens and Measurements
Maternal second-trimester specimens were 
retrieved from the California Department 
of Public Health’s Project Baby’s Breath 
(M. Kharrazi, P.I.) archives, which includes 
serum and blood cell pellet specimens 
collected for routine prenatal screening during 
15–19 weeks gestation. Maternal specimens 
were collected in serum separator tubes by 
obstetrical care service providers and under-
went testing within 7 days of collection at a 
central laboratory (median time, 3 days). After 
1–2 days of refrigeration, leftover specimens 
were stored at –20°C. Consent forms for the 
screening program distributed at the time of 
the blood collection stipulated that specimens 
and results from prenatal testing could be used 
for research purposes given IRB approval.
PCB congeners (n = 37) and 9 persistent 
pesticides [hexachlorobenzene, β-hexa 
chloro-
cyclo 
hexane, γ-hexachloro 
cyclo 
hexane, 
oxy 
chlor 
dane, trans-nonachlor, mirex, 
2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)-1,1-dichloroethene 
(p,p´-DDE), 2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)-
1,1,1-trichloroethane (p,p´-DDT), and 
2-(4-chlorophenyl)-2-(2-chlorophenyl)- 
1,1,1-trichloroethane (o,p´-DDT)] were 
measured in maternal serum samples. 
Determination of target analytes was 
performed by gas  
chromatography– 
isotope 
dilution high resolution mass spectrom-
etry (GC-IDHRMS) employing a Double 
Focusing Sector (ThermoFinnigan DFS, 
Bremen, Germany) instrument (Jones et al. 
2012). Concentrations of analytes were 
reported as ng/g lipid weight (weight of 
serum lipids), corrected for background 
(e.g., subtraction of median contamina-
tion of blank samples in the same run as the 
unknowns; 3 blanks were included in every 
set of 30 samples). The total lipid concentra-
tion was calculated from total cholesterol 
and trigly 
ceride concentration according to 
Phillips et al. (1989). Total cholesterol and 
triglyceride serum concentration was measured 
using an enzymatic reaction on a Roche ModP 
chemistry analyzer (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). 
Limits of detection (LOD values) were 
 
calculated for each individual sample.
Statistical Analyses
These analyses included singleton births 
with final case status (see “Diagnostic 
Verification”) and PCB/OCP measurements 
available. Individuals missing all exposure 
biomarkers (due to insufficient sample; 
n = 5), and individuals censored due to labo-
ratory error (failure of automation system; 
n = 33) were excluded, leaving a total of 
1,144 individuals. This number includes 545 
children with ASD, 181 children with ID 
without ASD, and 418 GP control children.
For each of the 37 PCBs and 9 OCPs 
measured, the percent of the study group 
with levels above the LOD was calculated. 
Only those analytes with at least 60% of 
the values above the LOD were included in 
further analysis (11 PCBs, 2 OCPs), as has 
been recommended and utilized in prior 
work of these and other POPs to avoid biased 
estimates in data using imputed values for 
measurements < LOD (Lubin et al. 2004; 
Sjödin et al. 2008; Windham et al. 2015). 
Participants with measurements < LOD had 
their values replaced with LOD divided by 
the square root of 2 (Axelrad et al. 2009; 
Sjödin et al. 2014), although alternative 
methods for imputing values below the LOD 
were also utilized (see “Sensitivity Analyses,” 
below). Descriptive statistics, including calcula-
tion of geometric means, for PCBs and the 
two OCPs were compared among the ASD, 
ID, and GP groups, and correlation coeffi-
cients between congeners and pesticides were 
calculated. Potential covariates, obtained 
from birth certificates or screening program 
records, were selected on the basis of a priori 
associations with ASD/ID and/or the PCB/
OCPs and were then examined for associations 
with ASD and ID and with the quartiles of 
analytes. Variables included in final adjusted 
models were the study matching factors (child 
sex, month and year of birth), maternal age, 
maternal race/ethnicity, maternal weight at 
time of sample collection, and parity. Other 
variables tested but not included in final 
models (as they did not alter estimates) were 
paternal age, maternal birthplace, and child 
low birth weight and gestational age. In 
addition, we examined the effect of poten-
tial co-pollutant confounding by examining 
adjustment of individual PCB congeners for 
other congeners, the sum of PCBs, and for the 
pesticides separately. Further, we examined 
whether adjustment for a data-driven measure 
of genetic inheritance (Price et al. 2006), 
obtained using principle components (PCs) 
derived from principal components analysis 
of available genome-wide data, altered results. 
Specifically, the top two PCs (which accounted 
for the majority of variation) were included in 
secondary analyses (adjusted as for final models 
with the exception of race/ethnicity, accounted 
for by the PCs). Adjustment for PCs was 
not conducted for the ID–GP comparisons, 
because genetic  
information was not available 
for the ID group.
We created a variable for total PCB 
exposure by summing the individual concen-
trations of congeners with detection rates 
 Lyall et al.

> 60% (see Table 1 for congener-specific 
detection rates); other sums (Axelrad et al. 
2009; Wolff et al. 1997) were also examined 
in secondary analyses (see “Appendix” in the 
Supplemental Material for a list).
Quartiles of chemical concentrations 
were created based on the GP control distri-
bution. Tests of trend for these analyses were 
conducted using a Wald test in separate 
adjusted models using the numerical quartile 
variable for analyte levels. In secondary 
analyses, we also explored alternate param-
eterizations of the distribution, including 
high and low deciles. Matching was broken in 
analyses in order to include all individuals (e.g., 
children originally identified with ID but later 
determined to be ASD) with measured OCCs. 
Unconditional logistic regression was used to 
obtain crude and multivariable adjusted odds 
ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals 
(CIs) for the association between the catego-
rized exposure biomarkers and ASD or ID, in 
comparison to GP controls.
For analyses of risk of ASD, we also 
conducted stratified analyses to examine 
potential effect modification by child sex and 
main categories of maternal race/ethnicity 
(non-Hispanic white, Hispanic). Further, 
we conducted analyses examining whether 
ASD risk differed according to presence or 
absence of intellectual disability by modeling 
risk of ASD with and without ID relative to 
GP controls.
Sensitivity Analyses
Sensitivity analyses conducted to assess 
robustness of results included a) excluding 
from the ASD group individuals originally 
served as ID in the DDS system, but reclassi-
fied as ASD following expert review (n = 132 
of the 545 ASD cases); b) using conditional 
logistic regression analyses within the subset 
of matched ASD–GP pairs (n = 788) to 
examine the impact of breaking matching; 
c) removing those individuals with values 
< LOD; and d) considering alternate strate-
gies for replacing values < LOD, including 
using laboratory-read values for low sample 
volumes originally censored to < LOD, and 
multiple imputation using SAS PROC MI 
(SAS Institute Inc. 2015). Data used to 
impute missing values included all OCCs 
assessed here, case status, and all covariates 
used in adjusted models.
Results
A total of 11 PCB congeners [PCBs 28, 99, 
118, 138/158, 153, 170, 180, 187, 194, 
196/203, 199; congeners reported together 
(138/158 and 196/203) indicate co-elution 
on the chromatographic system, yielding a 
combined concentration] and 2 OC pesti-
cides (trans-nonachlor and p,p´-DDE) were 
measured at levels above the LOD in > 60% 
of the study population. Geometric mean 
concentrations were generally somewhat 
lower for these chemicals than the concentra-
tions among all females from the National 
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 
(NHANES) (as well as compared with indi-
viduals ≥ 20 years of age from this survey) 
(CDC 2009), except for PCB28, which 
was somewhat higher (Table 1). Most PCB 
congeners were significantly and highly 
correlated; other correlations between the 
exposure biomarkers were weak to moderate 
(see Table S1).
A number of demographic factors were 
associated with both outcomes and exposure 
levels (Table 2; see also Table S2). Most 
notably, children with ASD were approxi-
mately four times as likely to be male than 
female (as were GP controls due to matching), 
have older parents, and have mothers with 
higher education, whereas the ID group 
had a higher proportion of Hispanics and 
individuals utilizing government insurance 
programs at delivery, compared with the 
other groups (Table 2). Generally, among 
GP controls, factors related to higher socio-
economic status (SES) were related to higher 
PCB levels, whereas those linked with lower 
SES were related to higher pesticide levels 
(see Table S2).
Comparing the exposure biomarker levels 
across diagnostic groups, geometric mean 
levels of PCBs and trans-nonachlor were 
higher in ASD cases relative to GP controls. 
Levels of PCB28 and p,p´-DDE were higher, 
while levels of other exposure biomarkers 
were lower, in the ID group relative to the 
ASD and GP groups (see Table S3).
Associations with ASD
In crude and fully adjusted models, higher 
levels of a number of PCBs were associated 
with increased risk of ASD (Table 3), particu-
larly for PCBs 138/158, 153, 170, and 180 
[adjusted odds ratios (AORs) ~ 1.5 or greater 
for the top quartile]. Adjusted associations 
were strongest for PCB138/158 and PCB153 
(for highest quartile relative to the lowest 
quartile, AOR = 1.79; 95% CI: 1.10, 2.92 
and AOR = 1.82; 95% CI: 1.10, 3.02, 
respectively). These congeners were highly 
correlated (r = 0.98), though PCB153 was 
also highly correlated with PCB170 and 
180 (r = 0.93 and 0.94). When addition-
ally adjusting for genetic ancestry using 
the PCs from genome-wide data (instead 
of race/ethnicity), estimates were generally 
somewhat attenuated, though increases in 
risk were still suggested for PCBs 138/158 
and 153 (AOR = 1.54; 95% CI: 0.87, 2.71 
and AOR = 1.72; 95% CI: 0.97, 3.07, respec-
tively). The sum of PCB congeners demon-
strated a moderately elevated risk of ASD for 
the top quartile (OR = 1.39; Table 3), though 
the association was not significant (either

including genetic ancestry or not); results for 
other sums we examined were similar (results 
not shown). Tests of trend were significant 
only for PCB 138/158 and PCB153 (p = 0.03 
and p = 0.04 and respectively). Elevations 
in risk of ASD with the two OC pesticides 
were not suggested in crude or adjusted 
models (Table 3).
Due to the high correlation between most 
PCB congeners, results of many co-pollutant 
models yielded estimates with wide confi-
dence intervals; nonetheless, adjustment for 
moderate or weakly correlated chemicals 
did not alter findings (data not shown). 
Examination of greater extremes of the 
distribution suggested higher levels (top 
decile relative to the lowest decile) increased 
risk further for some congeners, including 
some not suggested in primary quartile 
analyses (particularly PCBs 28, 180, 187, 
and 196/203), though this pattern was not 
uniform across congeners (see Table S4). 
These analyses were also more sugges-
tive of increases in risk of ASD, with levels 
of trans-nonachlor above the lowest decile 
(with highest risk observed for the 10th–25th 
percentile, rather than for the top decile).
Despite some variation in results stratified 
by gender and race/ethnicity and according to 
ASD with and without ID, no clear patterns 
across strata emerged, and overall, similar 
associations as those seen in primary analyses 
were suggested (see Table S5). Sensitivity 
analyses also generally supported primary 
results (see Table S6). Removing individuals 
with values < LOD had no impact on the 
results (data not shown), nor did excluding 
ASD cases originally identified as ID.
Associations with ID
In analyses of risk of ID relative to GP 
controls, inverse associations were seen for 
a number of PCB congeners (PCBs 118, 
153, 170, 187, 194, 196/203, and 199) 
in crude models (Table 4). However, in 
fully adjusted models that accounted for 
confounding by demographic factors, many 
associations reversed in direction, and AORs 
elevated above 1.5 were seen for the highest 
levels of PCBs 138/158, 153, 187, and 
196/203. Confidence intervals were wide 
in these analyses due to the smaller number 
of ID cases. The strongest adjusted associa-
tions noted were for increases in ID risk with 
the 2nd and 4th quartiles of PCB138/158, 
though risk for those in the 3rd quartile was 
not increased (p for trend = 0.17). The sum 
of PCBs demonstrated a moderate, though 
nonsignificant, elevation in risk of ID for the 
top quartile, similar to that seen for ASD. 
Of the OC pesticides, the 3rd quartile of 
p,p´-DDE showed a significantly increased 
risk of ID in crude and adjusted models 
(AOR relative to 1st quartile = 1.89; 95% CI: 
1.03, 3.44), though no trend was suggested 
(p for trend = 0.57) and the 4th quartile did 
not indicate elevated risk. Adjusted analyses 
examining the highest decile of levels of these 
chemicals (see Table S4) were more suggestive 
of increased risk of ID with higher exposure, 
particularly for PCBs and the same congeners 
suggested in association with ASD, with many 
of these associations statistically significant, 
though confidence intervals were quite wide.
Discussion
The results of this large, population based 
case–control study suggest that exposure to 
PCB congeners in utero may influence risk 
of ASD in offspring. This is one of the few 
studies to date examining prenatal exposure 
to OCCs, with exposures assessed from 
biospecimens collected during pregnancy, 
in relation to ASD and ID diagnoses. Our 
findings add to potential neurodevelopmental 
concerns surrounding these chemicals.
Our results from a number of different 
modeling strategies overall suggested increased 
risk of ASD with higher levels of PCBs. 
Results were generally consistent for risk of 
ID, after accounting for strong confounding 
by demographic factors. Primary analyses 
highlighted PCBs 138/158 and 153 in 
association with ASD, though other corre-
lated congeners also demonstrated asso-
ciations above the null. PCB138/158 was 
also associated with over a doubling in risk 
of ID (though no dose–response trend was 
evident), perhaps suggesting the impact of 
exposure to this congener on neurodevelop-
ment broadly. Associations with even higher 
levels (e.g., the top decile) of PCBs suggested 
potentially higher risks of ASD and ID for 
additional PCBs (particularly 28, 180, 187, 
and 196/203), though we had limited statis-
tical power to fully address this question 
for analyses of ID. Both PCB138/158 and 
PCB153 are among the most frequently 
detected PCBs (Sjödin et al. 2014; Woodruff 
et al. 2011); structurally, they are both non-
dioxin-like, and we did find evidence for 
elevated risks with some other non-dioxin-
like congeners (which include PCBs 28, 99, 
170, 180, 187, 194, 196/203, and 199) in

analyses of higher extremes of the distribu-
tion. PCB153 is also a cytochrome p450 
(CYP)-inducing PCB (Wolff et al. 1997)—of 
interest given the role of CYP p450 genes in 
the breakdown of chemicals and the observa-
tion that genes in this family have been impli-
cated in ASD (Chakrabarti et al. 2009; Veatch 
et al. 2015). This and other PCB congeners 
have been previously associated with low 
birth weight (Casas et al. 2015) and disrup-
tion of thyroid hormones (Liu et al. 2012), 
relevant to both ASD and ID. In one of the 
two previous studies examining risk of ASD 
or ASD symptoms in relation to measured 
prenatal levels of PCBs, a suggestive asso-
ciation with overall PCBs measured during 
pregnancy and ASD was found (Cheslack-
Postava et al. 2013). In the other study, an 
inverse association between PCB178 but 
also a positive association with PCB153 
were reported with autistic behaviors as 
measured by the Social Responsiveness Scale 
(Braun et al. 2014). These prior studies may 
have been influenced by limited detection 
frequency (in the latter) and/or small sample 
size. Overall, however, results across our work 
and these studies are suggestive of an associa-
tion between higher levels of PCBs and risk of 
ASD, and possibly also ID.
We did not find evidence that higher 
levels of prenatal exposure to p,p´-DDE 
and trans-nonachlor increased risk of ASD, 
though decile analyses did suggest increases 
in risk and potential nonlinear trends with 
trans-nonachlor that should be further 
explored. Other OCPs had too low a detec-
tion frequency to be included in our primary 
analyses, limiting our ability to report on 
associations with levels of these chemicals. 
Individuals in the third quartile of p,p´-DDE 
levels had significantly increased odds of ID, 
but no dose–response effect was suggested. In 
previous work, an increased risk of autism in 
association with estimated maternal exposure 
to two other OCPs (dicofol and endosulfan) 
was reported (Roberts et al. 2007). Multiple 
studies have reported significant reductions 
in cognitive and neurodevelopmental scores 
(Torres-Sánchez et al. 2013) and various 
other neurodevelopmental deficits with 
prenatal DDE exposure (Rosas and Eskenazi 
2008), and though findings are not consis-
tent, animal studies have provided a biological 
basis for disruption of endocrine and immune 
systems, and evidence of neurotoxicity with 
prenatal exposure to OCPs (Grandjean and 
Landrigan 2014). Thus, continued investiga-
tion of OCPs in association with ASD and 
ID is warranted.
Our work suggests that ASD and ID may 
share some OCC risk factors. We did not 
note large differences in risk when examining 
ASD with or without co-occurring intellec-
tual disability, though further consideration 
of how risk may differ between ASD, ID, and 
ASD comorbid with ID, may prove fruitful in 
identifying risk factors specific to ASD symp-
tomatology versus factors related to impaired 
neurodevelopment more broadly.
We did not see strong increases in risk of 
either ASD or ID with higher levels of the 
sum of all PCB congeners detected or with

other, more mechanistically or functionally 
based PCB sums. This lack of association with 
combined congeners may suggest that indi-
vidual congeners play a greater role in associa-
tions with neurodevelopmental outcomes, or 
that simple summation does not adequately 
represent combined effects of mixtures 
of chemicals. Additional methodologically 
focused studies are needed to examine the 
effects of exposure to multiple chemicals.
This study has a number of strengths 
that represent significant improvements over 
prior work. These include a large sample size, 
measured levels of OCCs during gestational 
time periods critical to neurodevelopment, 
ability to adjust for a number of confounders 
and explore potential modifiers, and ASD 
diagnoses confirmed by expert clinician 
review. However, certain limitations should 
be considered in weighing these results. Our 
ability to tease out effects of correlated conge-
ners was limited. Because people are exposed 
to multiple chemicals, and individual PCB 
congeners are highly correlated, attribution of 
risk to a given congener should be interpreted 
with caution. Our study had somewhat lower 
average levels of some PCB congeners than 
those reported in NHANES; geographic and 
demographic differences, including differences 
in age distributions, may account for this. 
Positive associations with PCBs were attenu-
ated after accounting for genetic ancestry; 
thus, self-reported race/ethnicity information 
may not fully capture confounding that could 
be related to these factors.
As mentioned, multiple pathways could 
underlie associations between the OCCs 
examined here and ASD and ID. These 
include endocrine and/or immune system 
disruption, direct impacts on neuronal 
development, and epigenetic effects. PCBs 
and OCPs have been shown to alter thyroid 
hormone levels, and differences in neuronal 
development by PCB exposure through this 
pathway have been demonstrated in vitro 
(Kimura-Kuroda et al. 2007; Liu et al. 2012). 
Given extensive cross-talk among the devel-
oping immune and nervous systems (Bilbo 
and Schwarz 2012), established immune 
aberrations in autism (Goines et al. 2011; 
Mead and Ashwood 2015), and influence 
of OCCs on immune system development 
(Hertz-Picciotto et al. 2008), effects on the 
immune system is another particularly likely 
mechanism linking these factors.
Conclusion
The overall pattern of our results suggests 
increases in risk of ASD and ID with prenatal 
exposure to higher levels of a number of 
OCCs, particularly PCBs. Future work 
should further consider genetic background 
in the role of these exposures on neurodevel-
opmental outcomes. Continued investigation 
of OCCs in association with ASD and ID is 
needed, given our findings and the dearth of 
studies investigating this topic.
