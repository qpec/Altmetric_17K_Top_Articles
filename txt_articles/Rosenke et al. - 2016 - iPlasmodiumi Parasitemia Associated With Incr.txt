Background.
The ongoing Ebola outbreak in West Africa has resulted in 28 646 suspected, probable, and confirmed Ebola virus
infections. Nevertheless, malaria remains a large public health burden in the region affected by the outbreak. A joint Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention/National Institutes of Health diagnostic laboratory was established in Monrovia, Liberia, in August
2014, to provide laboratory diagnostics for Ebola virus.
Methods.
All blood samples from suspected Ebola virus–infected patients admitted to the Médecins Sans Frontières ELWA3
Ebola treatment unit in Monrovia were tested by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction for the presence of Ebola virus
and Plasmodium species RNA. Clinical outcome in laboratory-confirmed Ebola virus–infected patients was analyzed as a function of
age, sex, Ebola viremia, and Plasmodium species parasitemia.
Results.
The case fatality rate of 1182 patients with laboratory-confirmed Ebola virus infections was 52%. The probability of
surviving decreased with increasing age and decreased with increasing Ebola viral load. Ebola virus–infected patients were 20%
more likely to survive when Plasmodium species parasitemia was detected, even after controlling for Ebola viral load and age;
those with the highest levels of parasitemia had a survival rate of 83%. This effect was independent of treatment with antimalarials,
as this was provided to all patients. Moreover, treatment with antimalarials did not affect survival in the Ebola virus mouse model.
Conclusions.
Plasmodium species parasitemia is associated with an increase in the probability of surviving Ebola virus infection.
More research is needed to understand the molecular mechanism underlying this remarkable phenomenon and translate it into
treatment options for Ebola virus infection.

The Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa has so far resulted in
28 646 suspected, probable, and confirmed cases, including
11 323 deaths between 26 December 2013 and 30 March 2016
[1]. Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea have all been declared
Ebola free, but the virus has reemerged on several occasions,
with new cases most likely originating from viral persistence
in survivors [1]. Malaria endemicity remains the largest public
health burden in West Africa, with year-round transmission of
Plasmodium species (spp) parasites to humans [2]. In Liberia,
malaria is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, affecting
>1.2 million people annually [2]. Additionally, the breakdown
of public health infrastructure in affected countries during the
Ebola outbreak has likely resulted in an increase in malaria
morbidity and mortality [3, 4]. The high rate of malaria preva-
lence has therefore likely resulted in coinfections with Plasmo-
dium spp parasites and Ebola virus in a subset of patients, with
unknown consequences.
In response to the expanding Ebola virus outbreak, a joint
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Nation-
al Institutes of Health (NIH) diagnostic laboratory was estab-
lished at ELWA (Eternal Love Winning Africa) in Monrovia,
Liberia, in late August 2014. The laboratory provided diagnostic

 support to several Ebola treatment units (ETUs) and hospitals
that were managing potential Ebola virus–infected patients.
Here, we utilized demographic and laboratory data generated
from patients admitted to the Médecins Sans Frontières
(MSF) ELWA3 ETU in Monrovia with confirmed Ebola virus
infection to better understand the effect of patient-level factors,
including coinfection with Plasmodium spp parasites, on sur-
vival. Additionally, the effect of antimalarial treatments on
Ebola survival was tested in a mouse model.
METHODS
Molecular Diagnostic Testing
Whole-blood samples were collected from patients presenting
at the ETU with symptoms consistent with Ebola virus infection
and transferred to the diagnostic laboratory. RNA was extracted
from whole blood, and quantitative reverse transcription poly-
merase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed to detect
Ebola viremia as described previously [5]. Plasmodium spp para-
sitemia was detected by qRT-PCR as described previously [6, 7].
Data Collection
The human samples and accompanying metadata were exclu-
sively collected from MSF’s ELWA3 ETU in Monrovia solely
as diagnostic samples for public health surveillance and not
human subjects research, so institutional review board review
and approval were not required. Patient data forms accompa-
nied patient whole-blood samples submitted to the diagnostic
laboratory. Patient name, age, sex, and diagnostic test results
were recorded in a database. Age was further grouped into the
following categories: <5 years, 5 to <12 years, 12 to <18 years, 18
to <40 years, 40 to <65 years, and ≥65 years. The clinical out-
come of laboratory-confirmed Ebola virus–infected patients
was determined by cross-referencing a list of deceased patients
obtained from the ETU with the laboratory database. The data-
base was transferred to an honest broker for removal of all per-
sonally identifiable information at the request of the NIH Office
of Human Subjects Research. The honest broker was not
involved in data collection or data analysis. For data analysis,
the authors only had access to the database that was redacted
by the honest broker.
Statistical Analysis
A retrospective analysis of the data collected at the CDC/NIH
lab was performed. Descriptive statistics and Student t tests or
χ2 tests were used to compare differences between patients with
confirmed Ebola virus infection who survived and those who
died. Demographic and clinical variables were modeled using
univariable generalized log-binomial regression analysis to esti-
mate risk ratios (RRs) and identify factors significantly (P < .05)
associated with surviving Ebola virus infection in patients ≥5
years old (patients <5 years old were excluded from stratified
analyses due to limited sample sizes preventing robust survival
estimates for this group). Plasmodium parasitemia cycle
threshold (Ct) values, Ebola virus Ct values, and age were cate-
gorized by the following levels for analysis: Plasmodium:
Ct ≤ 20, Ct > 20 to <30, or negative (Ct ≥ 30); Ebola virus
load: Ct < 25; Ct 25 to <30; or Ct 30 to <37; and age: 5 to <40
years or ≥40 years. Significant variables in univariable models
were considered for inclusion in a multivariable model with
survival as the outcome built using backward stepwise selection
procedures; the final model was selected to minimize the
Akaike information criterion. RRs and 95% confidence inter-
vals (CI) were reported for significant variables; adjusted RRs
(aRR) were reported for variables included in the multivariable
model. Patients with missing data were compared to those with
complete records for differences, and were excluded from re-
spective analyses. All analyses were conducted using Statistical
Analysis Software (SAS) version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, North
Carolina).
Animal Experiments
All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional An-
imal Care and Use Committee of Rocky Mountain Laboratories,
NIH, and carried out by certified staff in an Association for As-
sessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care Inter-
national–accredited facility, according to the institution’s
guidelines for animal use, and followed the guidelines and
basic principles in the US Public Health Service Policy on Hu-
mane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (available at http://

pdf), and the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Ani-
mals (available at https://grants.nih.gov/grants/olaw/Guide-
for-the-Care-and-use-of-laboratory-animals.pdf).
Six-week-old BALB/c mice (Harlan, Indianapolis, Indiana)
were inoculated intraperitoneally with 100 50% lethal dose of
mouse-adapted Ebola virus [8]. Treatments (n = 7 animals per
treatment group) were initiated 1 hour postinoculation and con-
sisted of oral gavage with lumefantrine (350 mg/kg), artemether
(100 mg/kg), lumefantrine (350 mg/kg) and artemether (100
mg/kg), artesunate (100 mg/kg), amodiaquine (120 mg/kg), or
artesunate (100 mg/kg) and amodiaquine (120 mg/kg) resus-
pended in 100 µL of peanut oil [9, 10], or treated with vehicle
alone and continued once daily for 14 days or until animals
reached a predetermined humane endpoint. Treatment doses
were determined through a combination of allometric scaling
based on clinical dosing in humans and toxicity data in mice,
when available. An untreated control group was used for com-
parison. Animals were euthanized when an approved, predeter-
mined humane endpoint was reached.
RESULTS
Ebola Virus Infection
From late August 2014 until mid-February 2015, 1868 initial
patient samples, collected from patients suspected of being in-
fected with Ebola virus, were submitted to the joint CDC/NIH

 laboratory at ELWA by the ELWA3 ETU in Monrovia, Liberia.
The laboratory confirmed Ebola virus infection in 1182 (63%)
of those initial samples using qRT-PCR. Of those, 570 (48%)
patients survived the Ebola virus infection. Females had greater
survival than males (53% vs 44%; P = .007) (Table 1; Figure 1A),
and in univariable analysis were 20% more likely to survive
(RR, 1.2 [95% CI, 1.0–1.4]; Table 2), although this was no lon-
ger significant when adjusted for other variables in multivari-
able analysis. There were also significant differences in survival
by age group (P = .007). Patients aged 5 to <40 years had higher
survival (52%) than those aged ≥40 years (41%) or <5 years
(48%) of age (Table 1). Patients aged 12 to <18 years experi-
enced the highest survival rate (61%), whereas those ≥65
years had the lowest survival (17%) (Figure 1B). In univariable
analysis, those aged ≥40 years were 20% less likely to survive
than those aged 5 to <40 years (RR, 0.8 [95% CI, .7–.9];
Table 2).
Although the Ct value of an Ebola virus qRT-PCR is not a
direct measure of infectious virus, it can be used as a proxy
for viral load, with high Ct values corresponding to a low
viral load and low Ct values to a high viral load; Ct values
have been used as a proxy for viral load during the current as
well as previous outbreaks [7, 11–17]. Ebola virus qRT-PCR
Ct value upon admission was a significant predictor of survival
in univariable analysis in our cohort (P < .0001; Table 2). Pa-
tients who survived had a higher average Ebola virus qRT-
PCR Ct value on admission (28.4 ± 4.3) compared with those
who died (25.9 ± 3.8) (P < .0001; Table 1; Figure 1C). Ebola
virus qRT-PCR Ct values were evenly distributed and did not
differ significantly by age (P = .2; Figure 1D). Moreover, there
was an increase in survival of 30% (RR, 1.3 [95% CI, 1.3–1.5];
Table 2) with a decrease in viral load level (ie, increasing Ct
value); patients with the lowest viral loads (Ct 30–37) had a sur-
vival rate of 69%, whereas those with the highest viral loads
(Ct < 25) had a survival rate of only 35% (Table 1).
Effect of Plasmodium Parasitemia on Survival
Patient samples submitted to the CDC/NIH ELWA laboratory
were simultaneously tested for the presence of Plasmodium
spp parasitemia by qRT-PCR. In total, 956 of 1182 laborato-
ry-confirmed Ebola virus patients were examined for Plasmodi-
um spp parasitemia, of whom 185 (19%) were positive. Patients
with Plasmodium spp parasitemia were more likely to be youn-
ger (P = .0001) than those testing negative (Figures 1E and 2A).
Overall, patients with Plasmodium spp parasitemia had a sur-
vival rate of 58% vs only 46% for those without coinfection
(P = .007; Table 1). However, those with the highest level of par-
asitemia, as determined by a Ct value of ≤20, had 83% survival
compared with 53% for those with Ct values >20 to <30 (Table 1;
Figure 2B). Among this high Plasmodium spp parasitemia
group, survival ranged from a low of 67% among those aged
40 to <65 years to a high of 100% among those <12 years old
(Figure 2B).
After controlling for both age and Ebola Ct value, presence of
Plasmodium spp parasitemia (Ct < 30) was associated with a
20% increase in survival (aRR, 1.2 [95% CI, 1.1–1.4];
P = .004) in the multivariable model relative to those who
were negative for Plasmodium spp coinfection, whereas a

 Plasmodium spp Ct value of ≤20 was associated with a 40% in-
crease in survival (aRR, 1.4 [95% CI, 1.2–1.7]; P < .0001; Table 2
and Figure 2C). Patients with the highest Ebola viral loads (rep-
resented by low Ct values) still experienced the lowest survival
rates, with those coinfected with greater levels of Plasmodium
spp (Ct value ≤20) having slightly (P > .05) higher survival
(43%) than those without Plasmodium spp detected (39%).
However, among patients with moderate to low Ebola Ct val-
ues (Ct ≥ 25), those with Plasmodium spp Ct values of ≤20
had nearly double the survival rate of those without Plasmo-
dium spp detected across age groups (94% vs 54% for ages 5 to
<40 years and 100% vs 41% for ages ≥40 years, respectively;
P < .0001; Figure 2C). A formal interaction term between
Plasmodium spp and Ebola virus Ct values was assessed in
the multivariable model and was not significant (data not
shown).
To exclude the possibility that Plasmodium spp coinfection
resulted in patients visiting the ETU earlier and thus receiving
supportive care from an earlier disease stage onward than pa-
tients without Plasmodium spp coinfection, we attempted to an-
alyze the time between symptom onset and admission to the
ETU for both groups of patients. However, this analysis proved
to be problematic as admission dates were missing for a major-
ity of patients. Instead, the time between self-reported time of
symptom onset and molecular diagnosis was analyzed, assum-
ing that any discrepancies between time of admission and time
of molecular diagnosis would be similar in both patient groups,

 but realizing the limited value of this analysis due to inadequate
reporting of symptom onset and missing or incorrect informa-
tion reported in the database. The number of days between
onset and molecular diagnosis did not differ significantly by
survival and Plasmodium spp coinfection status (P = .2), nor
was it a significant predictor in a model with survival as the
outcome (P = .3) (data not shown).
Effect of Antimalarial Treatment on Ebola Survival
Although all patients at the ELWA3 ETU were treated with the
antimalarial drugs artemether and lumefantrine (AL), as per
World Health Organization and MSF protocol [18, 19], we
wanted to evaluate if antimalarial treatments would directly af-
fect Ebola virus replication and disease outcome. Therefore, 2
antimalarial treatment regimens, AL as well as artesunate and
amodiaquine (ASAQ) were tested in the mouse model of Ebola
virus infection; individual antimalarial drugs (artemether,
lumefantrine, artesunate, and amodiaquine), as well as combi-
nation therapy (AL, ASAQ) were tested. Treatment was started
1 hour postinoculation with a lethal dose of mouse-adapted
Ebola virus. All animals treated with antimalarial drugs, either
individually or in combination, as well as vehicle-treated con-
trols, died of the Ebola virus infection within 8 days postinoc-
ulation (Figure 3).
DISCUSSION
The Ebola virus outbreak in West Africa has had a devastating
effect on the population, directly as well as indirectly through
the breakdown of the public health infrastructure in the 3
main affected countries, Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Guinea.
The unprecedented size of this outbreak has provided a unique
opportunity to increase our understanding of the pathogenesis
of Ebola virus infection in humans and to guide the develop-
ment of countermeasures against Ebola virus infections. Here,
Figure 2.

was calculated among these groups. Patients aged <5 years were excluded from multistratified analyses due to limited sample sizes across categories preventing accurate
survival estimates. Gray bars: Plasmodium spp negative; blue bars: Plasmodium spp Ct value >20–<30; red bars: Plasmodium spp Ct value ≤20. Numbers above bars indicate

 we analyzed the laboratory diagnostic results and disease
outcome data available from Ebola virus–infected patients ad-
mitted to the ELWA3 ETU in Monrovia, Liberia, and found
an association between coinfection with Plasmodium spp para-
sites and surviving an Ebola virus infection. One explanation for
this association could be that the antimalarial treatment provid-
ed to those patients with a positive Plasmodium spp parasitemia
laboratory diagnosis had an antiviral effect on Ebola virus rep-
lication. However, all patients at the ELWA3 ETU received a
course of AL combination treatment upon admission to the
ETU according to MSF protocols, regardless of the outcome
of the Plasmodium spp parasitemia test. Thus, the observed in-
creased survival is unlikely to be due to a beneficial effect from
the AL treatment. A field report and recent study from an ETU
in Foya, Liberia, suggested an increased survival in Ebola pa-
tients treated with the antimalarial drugs ASAQ [20,21]. There-
fore, ASAQ and AL were tested in a lethal mouse model of
Ebola virus infection. Neither of the antimalarial treatments af-
fected survival in the mouse model, nor did survival increase
when any of the 4 drugs were given as individual treatments.
These results do not support an antiviral effect of antimalarial
drugs against Ebola virus.
Increased survival among those with both Ebola virus infec-
tion and Plasmodium spp parasitemia was independent of viral
load and age, suggesting that the increased survival was the re-
sult of an indirect effect on the host rather than a direct effect on
Ebola virus replication. Due to the outbreak setting in which the
data we analyzed here were collected, we were not able to ana-
lyze other factors that may have affected survival, such as time
between symptom onset and admission to the ETU or the po-
tential presence of comorbidities in a subset of patients. We
were able to circumvent the first problem by using date of lab-
oratory diagnosis as a proxy for admission date and we have no
reason to think comorbidities would differ significantly between
patients with and without Plasmodium spp coinfection.
However, improvement of data collection in future outbreaks
would enable a more thorough analysis of factors that may in-
fluence survival.
A correlation between coinfection with another virus and in-
creased probability of survival of Ebola virus infection has been
suggested previously. In a small cohort of Ebola virus–infected
patients in Sierra Leone, a positive effect of GB virus C coinfec-
tion on survival was detected, although this effect was con-
founded by age [22]. GB virus C, which is not known to
cause human disease, is thought to modulate the immune re-
sponse to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and thereby
attenuate HIV pathogenesis. The authors hypothesize that a
similar immunomodulatory mechanism exists during Ebola
virus infection.
Similarly, there are several examples of Plasmodium spp in-
fections resulting in a suppression of the immune response to a
secondary infection. Children with malaria and a respiratory in-
fection were less likely to have pneumonia than children with a
respiratory infection alone [23]. This epidemiological link was
investigated experimentally by simultaneously infecting
C57BL/6J mice with Plasmodium chabaudi chabaudi AS and
pneumovirus of mice (PVM). In coinfected mice, weight loss
due to PVM, inflammatory cytokine production, and recruit-
ment of inflammatory cells to the lungs were reduced compared
to mice infected with PVM alone. This effect may be due to an
early systemic upregulation of IFN-β observed in coinfected
mice that was not observed in mice infected with Plasmodium
or PVM alone [24].
In children with Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium
infection, a severe Plasmodium falciparum coinfection can turn
a self-limiting infection into a life-threatening one. Based on co-
infection studies in mice, it is thought that the P. falciparum in-

The effect of antimalarial treatments on survival of Ebola virus infection in a lethal mouse model. Mice were inoculated with a 100 50% lethal dose of mouse-
adapted Ebola virus, treatment with antimalarial compounds was started at 1 hour postinoculation, and survival was monitored. Animals were left untreated or treated with
vehicle alone (left panel); treated with lumefantrine (350 mg/kg; L), artemether (100 mg/kg; A), or lumefantrine (350 mg/kg) and artemether (100 mg/kg; AL) (middle panel); or
treated with artesunate (100 mg/kg; AS), amodiaquine (120 mg/kg; AQ), or artesunate (100 mg/kg) and amodiaquine (120 mg/kg; ASAQ) (right panel). Treatments were con-
tinued daily until the end of the experiment.

 above, coinfection with Plasmodium spp in Ebola virus–infect-
ed patients may result in a dampening of the detrimental cyto-
kine storm [26] and thus increase survival.
Alternatively, the induction of natural killer (NK) cells by
Plasmodium infection may explain the increased survival in co-
infected individuals. Recently, it was shown that cynomolgus
macaques vaccinated with vesicular stomatitis virus-Ebola
virus (VSV-EBOV), a replication-competent vaccine vector ex-
pressing Ebola virus glycoprotein, at 3 days prior to challenge
were partially protected from lethal Ebola virus challenge. The
most likely explanation for protection by VSV-EBOV in the ab-
sence of antibodies was the activation of innate immune re-
sponses and potentially NK cells induced by the VSV-EBOV
infection [27].Infection with Plasmodium spp also results in ac-
tivation of NK cells (reviewed in [28]), thus providing a possible
explanation for the positive effect of Plasmodium coinfection on
Ebola virus survival.
The joint CDC/NIH diagnostic laboratory at ELWA was set
up for diagnostic outbreak response rather than scientific re-
search purposes. As such, the cytokine responses in whole-
blood samples from patients in our cohort could not be studied
due to the limited availability of equipment and reagents in the
field laboratory at the time of sample collection and the lack of
appropriate cold-chain conditions required for retrospective
analysis.
The link between Plasmodium spp coinfection and survival
of Ebola virus infection clearly warrants further investigation
into the mechanism(s) underlying this phenomenon. If in-
creased survival is indeed due to an immunomodulatory effect
of Plasmodium spp coinfection, immunomodulatory drugs
could be investigated as potential options for supportive therapy
to alleviate Ebola virus infection once the mechanism is better
understood.
Although we found a positive association between Plasmodi-
um spp parasitemia and survival of Ebola virus infection in our
cohort, this effect was not affected by treatment with antimalar-
ials. Thus, our data currently do not warrant changing the
guidelines for treatment of malaria in patients with suspected,
probable, and confirmed Ebola virus infection [18, 19].
