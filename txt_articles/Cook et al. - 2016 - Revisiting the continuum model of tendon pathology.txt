ABSTRACT
The pathogenesis of tendinopathy and the primary
biological change in the tendon that precipitates
pathology have generated several pathoaetiological
models in the literature. The continuum model of tendon
pathology, proposed in 2009, synthesised clinical and
laboratory-based research to guide treatment choices for
the clinical presentations of tendinopathy. While the
continuum has been cited extensively in the literature, its
clinical utility has yet to be fully elucidated. The
continuum model proposed a model for staging
tendinopathy based on the changes and distribution of
disorganisation within the tendon. However, classifying
tendinopathy based on structure in what is primarily a
pain condition has been challenged. The interplay
between structure, pain and function is not yet fully
understood, which has partly contributed to the complex
clinical picture of tendinopathy. Here we revisit and
assess the merit of the continuum model in the context
of new evidence. We (1) summarise new evidence in
tendinopathy research in the context of the continuum,
(2) discuss tendon pain and the relevance of a model
based on structure and (3) describe relevant clinical
elements (pain, function and structure) to begin to build
a better understanding of the condition. Our goal is that
the continuum model may help guide targeted
treatments and improved patient outcomes.
The continuum of tendon pathology1 has been
cited over 250 times since publication in 2009. The
original paper condensed clinical and laboratory-
based research into a model of tendon pathology
designed to help clinicians understand the various
presentations of tendinopathy and to allow rational
placement of interventions based on the con-
tinuum. Although the continuum was based on evi-
dence from
lower
limb
tendons,
it
has
been
adapted for rotator cuff2 and equine tendon path-
ology.3 The original paper suggested that the model
should be tested against further developments in
the clinical and research environment to assess its
relevance. Seven years later, we reflect on the rele-
vance of the model to sports medicine and physio-
therapy. The main questions that have been raised
since the continuum was proposed are:
1. What is the relevance of tendon structure and
pathology in what is primarily a painful condition?
2. What is the relationship between structure, pain
and function?
3. How should tendon pain be considered as part
of the continuum?
4. Is the response to load normal adaptation or a
pathological process?
5. How can the continuum guide clinical treatment?
THREE CATEGORIES OF PATHOAETIOLOGY
MODELS AND THE RELATION OF STRUCTURE
TO PAIN
The continuum model is one of several models on
the pathoaetiology of tendon pathology.1 4–7 These
tendon pathology models can be divided into three
groups depending on the primary or key event in the
pathology ‘cascade’: (1) collagen disruption/tearing,
(2) inflammation or (3) tendon cell response. Several
other models have attempted to integrate pain and
the central nervous system with pathology.8 9
The complexity of normal tendon structure, the
multifaceted nature and magnitude of the tendon’s
response to injury, and the difficulty in creating
an experimental model that mimics load-related
tendon pathology in humans make it difficult to
construct a simple and robust model that accommo-
dates all aspects and phases of the condition. There
are key arguments for and against all these models,
as well as commonalities among models (http://
tinyurl.com/zkzza9x).
Collagen disruption/tearing model
The collagen tearing hypothesis is the oldest and
perhaps the most open to challenge because normal
collagen fibres cannot tear in vivo without substan-
tial alterations in the non-collagenous matrix.10
The longevity of normal tendon collagen suggests
that collagen tearing and remodelling does not
occur as a result of loading.11 12 Recent publica-
tions cite early changes more as fibre kinking and a
‘loosening’ of the collagenous matrix.13–15 As such,
in vivo animal models of tendinopathy based on
collagen disruption theory (collagenase injection,
tendon laceration) have limited relevance to human
tendinopathy.
On the basis of the collagen disruption/tearing
concept, Arnoczky et al5 proposed that tendon
pathology may be driven by understimulation of
the tendon cell due to a lack of load transmission
through the torn collagen fibres. While collagen
tearing may not be the primary event in tendon
pathology, understimulation of the tendon cell
may play a role in degenerative pathology. Regions
of the degenerative tendon may be mechanically
silent (ie, unable to transmit and sense tensile
load) and thus potentially unresponsive to load
due
to
fibrillar
disorganisation.
This
lack
of
tendon cell stimulus may explain the limited
reversibility of degenerative tendon pathology16
and lack of remodelling following exercise-based
interventions.17

 Inflammatory model
The role of inflammation in the tendon’s response to overuse is
complex.18 A classic inflammatory response in the tendon is
seen when a tendon (and its blood supply) is ruptured or lacer-
ated. The tissue response to such an insult is profound19—a
large immune cell and tenocyte response increases protein pro-
duction and tendon size.
While inflammatory cells have been observed in pathological
tendons,20–23 the response does not seem to be a traditional
inflammatory response.24 25 Increases in inflammatory cytokines
(eg, COX-2, PGE-2, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β, transforming
growth factor (TGF)-β) have been reported in overuse tendino-
pathy;26–29 however, the presence of these substances does not
necessarily support the contention that inflammation is the
primary event or key driver of tendon pathology (figure 1).
Changes in the levels of inflammatory markers (vascular endo-
thelial growth factor, COX-2, TGF-α and TGF-β, PGE-2, IL-1,
IL-6) occur in response to cyclic load; tendon cell culture
studies suggest that these cytokines are expressed by the resident
tenocytes.29–33
The elevation in inflammatory cytokines observed in tendon
pathology may reflect tendon cell signalling in response to
mechanical stimuli resulting in an alteration in tendon synthesis
and degradation.34 An imbalance between synthesis and degrad-
ation may lead to tendon disorganisation.11 35 While it may
appear that the inflammatory models and the continuum of
pathology are distinct, they may not be mutually exclusive. A
tendon
cell
is
mechanoresponsive,
releasing
cytokines
in
response to overload that then stimulate matrix remodelling
(degradation and synthesis).
Tendon cell response model
The tenocyte is primarily responsible for maintaining the extra-
cellular matrix in response to its environment. Thus, changes in
tendon load and biochemical milieu will be sensed by the
tendon cell and result in a cascade of responses (cell activation,
proteoglycan expression and changes in collagen type).36
37
Similarly, a tendon cell-based response logically explains the
tendon’s adaptation to compressive loads that occurs in the
development of fibrocartilage within wrap-around tendons,38 or
with transient (direct blow)39 or chronic (entheseal pathology)
overload.40 It is unclear how collagen disruption/tearing models
of tendon pathology account for these features.
WHAT IS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN STRUCTURE, PAIN
AND FUNCTION?
The aim of the 2009 continuum model was threefold: (1) to
express the varied capability of pathological tendons to recover
structure, (2) to discuss the structural factors that limit return to
pain-free function and (3) to propose interventions tailored to
the stage of pathology. While the stages of the continuum are
primarily based on structural features, it does not suggest that
there is a direct relationship between structure, pain and dys-
function. In conceptualising the relationship between pain and
structural
change,
intratendinous
pathology
may
best
be
regarded as a risk factor for tendinopathy (defined as the clinical
presentation of pain and dysfunction independent of structural
pathology). Various prospective (relative risk 14.6; 95% CI 1.9
to 111.4)41 and cross-sectional studies (OR ranging from 3.9 to
16.2)42 43 have demonstrated that underlying structural path-
ology increases the risk of developing symptoms. Interestingly,
progression and worsening of tendon pathology over time
appears to be a greater risk factor for the development of pain
than the absolute extent of pathology itself.44
While not represented in the schematic of the continuum
model, the concept that ‘some tendons may have discrete
regions that are in different stages at the one time’.1 In revisiting
the continuum, we have emphasised the important clinical pres-
entation that is a hybrid of reactive and degenerative pathology,
which is ‘reactive-on-degenerative tendinopathy’ (figure 2). This
refers to clinical cases where the structurally normal (to conven-
tional imaging modalities at least) portion of the tendon may
drift in and out of a reactive response (figure 2).45 As discussed
above, the degenerative portions of the tendon appear mechan-
ically silent and structurally unable to transmit tensile load,
which may result in overload in the normal portion of the
tendon.46 Better imaging modalities and prospective studies are
needed to identify the structural factors (ie, amount of disorgan-
isation, variability in structure over time) that are important in
the development of pain.
There are clear associations and dissociations between struc-
ture, pain and function, and a number of reviews have focused
on this complex relationship in tendons.8
9 T
endon pain is
partly related to function, with tendinopathy decreasing muscle
strength and motor control, which in turn reduces function.47 48
Function in this context refers to the ability of the muscle to
repeatedly generate appropriate force that enables the tendon to
store and release energy for athletic movement. However,
changes in function also occur in the presence of structural
pathology, independent of pain. This highlights the complex
interplay among structure, pain and function.49 50 The clinical
presentation and quiescent changes in pain, structure and func-
tion can be linked as depicted in figure 3.
WHERE DOES TENDON PAIN FIT IN THE CONTINUUM
MODEL?
Clinically, tendon pain presentations fall into two categories in
the continuum model: (1) reactive tendon with a first presentation
of tendon pain following acute overload and (2) reactive-on-late
dysrepair/degenerative tendon pathology (figure 4). This strongly
suggests that reactive tendon pathology has a local nociceptive
driver.
The identity of the nociceptive driver in tendinopathy
remains elusive. The strong relationship between tendon pain
and mechanical load, together with the mechanoresponsiveness
of tenocytes and lack of sensory innervation of the deep tendon
tissue, may implicate paracrine signalling by the tendon cells

 as a potential driver of nociception51 These substances may
sensitise peripheral mechanoreceptors near or in the periten-
don52 stimulating the peripheral nerve and be interpreted as
pain. This may explain why pathology can occur deeper in
tendons without tendon pain as this region is remote to the
nerve supply. Theoretically, a painful reactive or reactive-
on-degenerative tendon may increase expression of nociceptive
substances and their receptors, stimulating the peripheral nerve
and be interpreted as pain. Diffuse reactive pathology may also
irritate the peritendon due to an increase in tendon size.
The pain-free tendon may contain substantial matrix and cell
abnormalities, but limited nociceptive substance production, sig-
nalling ability or receptor activation, which is in summary an
insufficient nociceptive stimulus. The role of the central nervous
system in the modulation of nociception and output of pain is
acknowledged and well described by others;8 53 however, it is
beyond the scope of this paper.
Loading a painful tendon perpetuates nociceptive stimuli, and
it is plausible that secondary hyperalgesia in tendinopathy is a
response to ongoing nociception. Hyperalgesia by itself does
not define tendinopathy as a pathophysiological pain state or
centrally driven phenomenon.51 Several clinical features support
this concept; tendon pain remains localised and temporally
linked to tissue loading,54 with little evidence of spontaneous
tendon pain (stimulus-independent pain) that is a feature of
other pathophysiological pain states.
Some consider tendinopathy to be centrally driven, while also
questioning the relevance of local changes in tendon structure.
While there is evidence of contralateral sensory perception
changes in people with tendinopathy,55 this can equally reflect
persistent nociceptive drive from the local tissue. Acute pain
conditions, such as acute inversion ankle sprain, also caused sec-
ondary hyperalgesia;56 however, this can be reversed instantan-
eously with an anaesthetic. This suggests that the nociceptive

 input from the periphery maintains sensitisation.57 Unilateral
isometric exercises in patellar tendinopathy have no effect on
contralateral pain,58 suggesting that local factors or pathways
are critical in pain production. In summary, we acknowledge
that there is good evidence for adaptations (both motor and
sensory) in tendinopathy, yet we cannot dismiss the role of local
nociceptively driven pain.
IS A RESPONSE TO LOAD PART OF AN ADAPTIVE OR
PATHOLOGICAL PROCESS?
Normal tendon tissue responds to load with both synthesis and
degradation of the matrix; however, turnover rates vary depend-
ing on the protein.59–61 Collagen turnover is minimal after skel-
etal maturity,11 12 whereas non-collagenous substances, such as
proteoglycans, are synthesised and degraded much more quickly
(days), suggesting that they may be a critical component in early
pathological or adaptive changes.12
W
e proposed that reactive pathology (as defined in the
model) results in an increase in large proteoglycans but further
consideration and recent studies suggest that there must be an
earlier phase that is less intense and potentially transient. The
Achilles tendon62 and superficial digital flexor tendon in the
horse63 undergo a definite but subtle structural response on
imaging 2 days after high loads that returned to normal by day
4. The time course of these changes in imaging appearance
(ultrasound tissue characterisation (UTC) echopattern) is similar
to that of the 2–3 days it takes to express and break down large
proteoglycans such as aggrecan.64–67 A similar response is seen
using MRI—this suggests an increase in large proteoglycans and
associated bound water in response to high load exercise.68 It is
unclear whether these changes are adaptive or pathological and
whether they have a lasting effect on the health of the tendon
(in reference to pain).
The normal Achilles tendon improves in structure as seen
using UTC69 over the course of an elite Australian football
preseason; this supports the adaptive pathway suggested within
the continuum.70 However, in this same cohort, 3 out of the 18
participants progressed to a reactive pathology, that is, structure
deteriorated and pain developed. This highlights that the effect
of load on tendon structure may vary depending on intrinsic
risk factors (genetics, adiposity, age, etc) and other features
within loading history.71 Load magnitude and recovery time, as
well as numerous other factors (type and consistency of load
stimulus), may influence tendon response and the progression
along the continuum.35 Furthermore, it also highlights the diffi-
culty in attempting to dichotomise the tendon’s response as
being pathological or adaptive, as these changes are likely to fall
within a greater continuum.
HOW WOULD THE PRACTITIONER CHOOSE A TREATMENT
BASED ON THE CONTINUUM?
The continuum model suggested that management may be opti-
mised by tailoring interventions to the stage of pathology and tar-
geting
the
primary
driver
(cell
activation)
and
inter-related
alterations in matrix integrity
. While exercise and load management
are fundamental to management, a plethora of intratendinous and
peritendinous interventions exist to ‘treat’ tendinopathy—this
increases the complexity of the clinical decision-making process.
T
endinopathy is a heterogeneous clinical presentation due to
the variable change in matrix structure, pain and dysfunction.9
Phenotyping of patients based on structure, pain, dysfunction
and load capacity may allow the clinician to direct appropriate
treatments at the critical limiting factors (figure 4).
Interventions targeting pain
Patients with tendinopathy present clinically primarily due to
pain, with available interventions directed at the painful tendon
including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroid
injections,72 extracorporeal shockwave therapy,73 extratendinous
high volume injection74 and surgical scraping.75 While the
Figure 4
Schematic representation of how we may phenotype patients with tendinopathy in relation to the continuum and target treatments. The
aim of treatment is to push the tendon into the green section with relatively little pain and good function. Tendon structure can be normalised in
the early stages of the continuum where rehabilitation can push the tendon ‘up the continuum’. In the latter stages of the continuum, ‘moving up
the continuum’ may not be possible, so interventions should be focused in ‘moving the tendon sideways’. It is important to note that interventions
directed solely at pain will not drive the tendon to a positive outcome as they do not address dysfunction, such as motor inhibition, strength and
power deficits, or tendon load capacity. Interventions that target structure may improve tendon structure and direct the tendon ‘upwards along the
continuum’; however, it will not address functional deficits (effect on pain is inconclusive) or load capacity and may leave the tendon vulnerable to
reinjury.

 majority of these treatments reduce pain in the short to medium
term, the longer term efficacy of some has been questioned.72
Addressing pain is critical; however, interventions directed
solely at pain have a minimal effect on the associated kinetic
chain deficits or tissue capacity and may result in the recurrence
of pain (figure 4).55
Interestingly, isometric quadriceps muscle contractions in
patellar tendinopathy induce immediate analgesia and reduce
cortical inhibition of the muscle, which in turn improves
strength.58 Intervening with a loading programme also has the
advantage of benefiting the tendon,76 the muscle,77 as well as
the cortical control of that muscle, which may lead to improve-
ments in function and a positive clinical outcome. An incremen-
tal load-based rehabilitation programme is capable of modifying
the balance of excitability and inhibition in muscle control,78
thus altering the loads transmitted by the tendon.
Interventions addressing function and load capacity
There are few papers that investigate dysfunction in tendinopa-
thy because pain and structure have been deemed to be more
important. It is also difficult in the clinic to quantify function
and the tendon’s load capacity, where pure measures of strength
may not reflect the whole picture (see separate paper on
‘Capacity’ in BJSM79). There can be alterations to the graded
recruitment of muscles associated with tendinopathy leading to
changes in function.58 Return to sport is potentially a measure
of function and load capacity, though most research has been
conducted outside of the competitive season. While addressing
pain may remove a barrier for improving function, dysfunction
including persistent deficits in muscle performance or the
kinetic chain, as well as insufficient tendon load capacity, may
well predispose the tendon to reinjury (figure 4). Further
research is needed to better characterise the functional deficits
associated with tendinopathy and develop useful tools for the
clinician.
Interventions targeting structure
The continuum model1 provided a framework to understand
the potential of the tendon to regain normal structure. This par-
ticularly applies to the reactive stage (figure 4) of the model
where it remains possible for the tendon to regain its normal
structure with optimal management.16 Treatments that may
dampen tendon cell response at this stage (unloading, medica-
tion directed at inhibiting the cell and resultant matrix changes)
may also reduce pain, although this is yet to be substantiated.
Notably, heavy load eccentric exercises or intratendinous injec-
tions may be highly provocative and deleterious within this
reactive stage.
In
degenerative
tendinopathy,
interventions
influencing
tendon structure are less critical, as the pathology appears to
have limited reversibility. Although the original continuum
paper suggested that treatments should focus on stimulating the
cell to produce collagen (in the degenerative region) and restruc-
ture the matrix, it has since been demonstrated that interven-
tions designed to change structure do not necessarily result in
these improvements.17
Furthermore, the pathological tendon appears to effectively
compensate for areas of disorganisation by increasing in cross-
sectional dimension to maintain sufficient volumes of aligned
fibrillar structure.80 Since the degenerative tendon has sufficient
levels of load-bearing tissue, and given the limited ability of the
tendon to reverse the pathology, treatment strategies should be
directed at optimising adaptation of the tendon as a whole
(figure 4). Specifically, treatment at this stage should aim to
build load capacity in the aligned fibrillar matrix portion of the
tendon rather than attempting to stimulate healing in the degen-
erative portion.
While the continuum classifies tendons based on the extent/
presence of structural disorganisation, targeting treatments at
regenerating the area of disorganisation may be futile as the
tendon may have already compensated, or be in the process of
doing so. This conceptual shift may be explained by the meta-
phor, treat the doughnut (area of aligned fibrillar structure), not
the hole (area of disorganisation). However, sufficient aligned
tissue of itself will not protect from further episodes of reactive
pathology; to achieve this, management must progress to
improving the load capacity of the ‘doughnut’ through a pro-
gressive loading rehabilitation.
In this context, it is difficult to find relevance for treatments
directed at repairing tendons and normalising structure through
the addition of growth stimulants (eg, platelet-rich plasma),81
which do not appear appropriate for the pathological process at
any of the continuum stages. It should also be recognised that
there is a hyperactive tendon cell response, as well as an increase
in tendon cell numbers, in all stages of tendinopathy, even in
the degenerative stage.64 The addition of additional cells (stem
or tenocytes) into a hypercellular environment would appear
counter-intuitive, as the ability to recreate a viable cell–matrix
relationship is limited in a frankly degenerative region of the
tendon that is unable to transmit tension.
DISCUSSION AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS
Regardless of the initiating event (overstimulation of resident
tenocyte, collagen disruption/tearing, inflammation), tendon
pathology is characterised by a significant cell response to
injury.7 82 It is unlikely that any one model fully explains all
aspects of the pathoaetiology of tendon pathology and its links
to pain and function, as these processes and relationships are
complex.
Equivocal clinical intervention outcomes from research that
may well be due to heterogeneity in the research cohorts.
Subgrouping by tendon pathology for clinical trials may give
clearer outcomes and better clinical guidance.
The capacity to test the continuum in humans is limited in
part by the capacity of present imaging modalities to detect
pathological and structural changes, along with the need for a
deeper understanding and greater precision in the measurement
of the various aspects of pain and associated dysfunction in ten-
dinopathy. The requirement to better comprehend these inter-
relationships
in
time
should
guide
effective
management
through considered interventions across the spectrum of presen-
tations. The history of biomedical research would remind us
that this paper, as with many of our colleagues, are just a part of
the very long and complex journey in the better understanding
of this challenging condition.
