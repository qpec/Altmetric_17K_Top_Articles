Abstract
Rationale & objectives We sought to develop an abbrevi-
ated protocol (AP) for breast MRI that maximizes lesion
detection by assessing each lesion not seen on mammography
by each acquisition from a full diagnostic protocol (FDP).
Materials & methods 671 asymptomatic women (mean
55.7 years, range 40–80) with a negative mammogram
were prospectively enrolled in this IRB approved study. All
lesions on MRI not visualized on mammography were
analyzed, reported, and suspicious lesions biopsied. In
parallel, all FDP MRI acquisitions were scored by lesion to
eventually create a high-yield AP.
Results FDP breast MRI detected 452 findings not visible
on mammography, including 17 suspicious lesions rec-
ommended for biopsy of which seven (PPV 41.2%) were
malignant in six women. Mean size of the four invasive
malignancies was 1.9 cm (range 0.7–4.1), all node nega-
tive; three lesions in two women were ductal carcinoma
in situ. Nine biopsied lesions were benign, mean size
1.2 cm (range 0.6–2.0). All biopsied lesions were in
women with dense breasts (heterogeneously or extremely

data were used to identify four high-yield acquisitions: T2,
T1-pre-contrast, T11.5, and T16 to create the AP with a scan
time of 7.5 min compared to 24 min for the FDP.

Introduction
Breast MRI has potential for use in breast cancer screening
due to its increased sensitivity over mammography.
Screening breast MRI has primarily been studied in women
at high risk for breast cancer [1, 2] based on multiple trials
[3–7] and reflected in screening guidelines from the
American Cancer Society [1, 2]. Allowing for evaluation of
both tumor architecture and biological activity, MRI’s
application as an effective and efficient screening tool in
the general population is still evolving. The application of
MRI in more general screening is hindered by high cost [8],
required injection of contrast, reported high rates of false
positives [9], and lack of expertise in interpretation [10].
The cost for breast MRI is due, in large part, to high fixed
costs for equipment acquisition, operation, maintenance,
and relatively low throughput due to exam duration.
Although early efforts with the empiric selection of
limited acquisitions have been proposed [11], a systematic
process at defining the appropriate type and number of
acquisitions is lacking. Development of such an abbrevi-
ated MRI would be both cost and time efficient without
sacrificing accuracy allowing for broader utilization of this
sensitive tool. This study analyzes a full diagnostic proto-
col (FDP) breast MRI and uses this information to identify
high-yield acquisitions to develop an abbreviated protocol
(AP) for general breast cancer screening.
Materials and methods
Subjects
From 2009 to 2011, all women who obtained their routine
mammograms at a community hospital or surrounding area
(film screen with computer-assisted detection) were con-
sidered for eligibility in the study. All mammogram reports
contained family history of breast cancer and breast density
usingthebreastimagingreportingdatasystem(BI-RADS)4th
edition. Women with screening mammograms, read as BI-
RADS 1, negative, or 2, benign, were considered eligible as
were initially incomplete examinations (BI-RADS 0) with a
final BI-RADS assessment of 1, 2, or 3 after diagnostic
workup. Initial BI-RADS three assessments were also eligible
who received further workup, but without recommendation
for biopsy, resulting in a final BI-RADS assessment 1, 2, or 3
[12]. Women with positive mammograms (BI-RADS 4a, 4b,
4c, 5, or 6) were ineligible. Other exclusion criteria included
personalhistory ofbreastcancer,priorchest radiationtherapy,
or any MRI contraindications. Invitations and consent forms
offering a breast MRI at no charge if performed within
30 days of their mammogram were sent to 1200 women of
whom 671 accepted and received FDP breast MRI exams.
None of the women reported having a prior breast MRI.
Process
MRI images for this prospective study were acquired at a
community hospital and interpreted by an outside radiol-
ogy institution conducting this research. Both facilities are
American College of Radiology (ACR) certified centers in
mammography and breast ultrasound. The reading institu-
tion is also ACR certified as a breast imaging center of
excellence which includes breast MRI. Accuracy of the
mammogram studies (films and reports) were verified by
the MRI interpreting radiologist and available during MRI
interpretation performed by one of four radiologists with
breast MRI experience ranging from 6 to 12 years.
A standard FDP breast MRI was performed on a typical
MRI scanner (Supplementary Table 1) using the following
acquisitions: T2 (non-fat suppressed), STIR (Short-TI inver-
sion recovery), T1-pre-contrast (T1-pre) prior to injection of
contrast and T11, T12, T13, T14, T15, T16, and T1-high-reso-
lution(T1HiRes) followingcontrast(subscriptreferstominutes
post-injection). The MRI acquisition data were post-pro-
cessed on a CADstream system (Merge Healthcare, Chicago,
IL) to create T1 subtraction images, maximum intensity pro-
jection images, and post-injection kinetic curves-color map-
ping using T1-pre and post-contrast T11, T12, and T16
acquisitions with a threshold of 80% change in pixel intensity.
All enhancing and non-enhancing lesions not detected on
mammography were evaluated and a report generated by the
interpreting radiologist using pre-defined MRI interpretive
criteria (Table 1). In parallel, each lesion was scored by
acquisition using criteria defined in Table 2 and recorded by
the supervising radiologist trained technicians allowing the
interpreting radiologist’s evaluation of the MRI for the dic-
tated report to be unbiased by the applied scores. The inter-
preting radiologist then reviewed the applied scores and made
adjustments in fewer than 2% of the cases (Tables 4, 5).

 If a lesion did not clearly meet MRI BI-RADS 1 or 2
(there were no MRI BI-RADS three assessments), an MRI
BI-RADS assessment of 4a, 4b, 4c, or 5 (recorded as a 4 or
5 in Table 4) was reported and a biopsy attempt was first
made by ultrasound guidance. MRI-guided biopsy was
performed only after unsuccessful ultrasound biopsy in less
than 10% of the cases. The data collected for this study
were evaluated for the development of the AP only after
completion of the two-year data collection period.
FDP breast MRI interpretive criteria and evaluative
methods for abbreviated protocol development
The evaluative process of a lesion utilizes information from
three basic aspects, i.e., morphology, signal response from
each individual acquisition, and kinetic activity all based
on the lesion’s conspicuity (intensity relative to surround-
ing tissue) as well as change in conspicuity following
contrast. We hypothesized that an acquisition that provides
greater visual conspicuity of lesion intensity improves
characterization of morphology. We further considered
histopathologic outcomes seeking individual acquisitions
that
best
distinguish
suspicious
from
non-suspicious
lesions. As such, lesion conspicuity on a scale of -3 to ?3
(Table 2) is presented in Table 4 for suspicious lesions and
Table 5 as means for non-suspicious lesion types. As a
general observation (Table 5), the mean intensity of each
pre-contrast acquisition of suspicious lesions was less than
the mean for non-suspicious lesions (substantiating that
malignant lesions are often more difficult to see within
non-enhanced breast tissue than benign lesions), and on
post-contrast acquisitions, the reverse is observed. Thus,
the ratios of relative intensities reported in Table 5, and
ultimately plotted in Chart 2, were defined as the absolute
value of non-suspicious lesion intensity divided by the
suspicious lesion intensity for acquisitions prior to contrast
and the reverse for acquisitions following contrast. This
allows the majority of the ratios to be reported as values
higher than 1 for visual discernment of a clinical inter-
pretation of how these lesions present themselves. When
the denominator of the ratio was 0, it was assigned a value
of ‘‘25?’’. Finally, we considered kinetic enhancement of
each lesion and recorded kinetic information as one of four
commonly used kinetic curves (Table 2).
Historically, T13, T14, and T15 post-contrast acquisi-
tions are used for redundancy in the event patient motion
causes signal degradation of one or more of the other post-
contrast T1 images. No signal degradation occurred due to
motion for any of our women. Therefore, these acquisitions
added no value to the development of the AP, and results
from these sequences are not reported in any of the tables.
The potential for increased risk of malignancy associated
with
increased
background
parenchymal
enhancement
(BPE) has been recently reported [13]. The inability to
evaluate each focus and lack of any standard method of
recording these numerous tiny lesions prompted us to create
a subjective approach to reporting BPE data. Conservatively,
BPE was recorded as only one unidentified mammographic
finding for each quadrant of involvement, not to exceed two
lesions in each breast and, regardless of signal intensity,
recorded the pattern as symmetric (not requiring biopsy) or
asymmetric (requiring further workup). A lesion of concern

rately using the interpretive criteria of Table 1.
Statistical analyses
T test and its nonparametric equivalent, Wilcoxon test, were
used to compare the distribution of the scores and the mean
and median values for a given acquisition by comparing all
suspicious lesions and all type specific non-suspicious lesions.
The conclusions did not differ, and the reported p values are
from the Wilcoxon test to account for non-normality and non-
equality of variances in some comparisons [14]. All analyses
were performed in SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Two-
sided p \ 0.05 was statistically significant.
Results
Patient characteristics
From 2009 to 2011, 671 asymptomatic women received a
FDP breast MRI (Table 3), mean age 55.7 years (range
40–80). Of these, 141 (21%) had a first-degree relative with
breast cancer. No woman reported having a known BRCA1
or -2 pathogenic mutation.
Lesion identification
Figure 1 provides the MRI screening outcomes. Of the 671
women, 367 (55%) had dense breasts (heterogeneously or
extremely dense on mammography). Of these women, 164
(45%) had one or more lesions not detected on their mam-
mograms, totaling 331 lesions. The remaining 304 (45%)
had non-dense breasts (fatty or scattered fibroglandular tis-
sue (FGT)) of whom 70 (23%) had one or more lesions not
detected on mammography, totaling 121 lesions. Overall, as
a result of obscuring FGT, 435 lesions in 218 women were
not observed on mammography and assessed as MRI BI-
RADS 1 or 2 (negative or benign) and 17/452 lesions (3.8%)
were assessed as BI-RADS 4 or 5 (suspicious, requiring
biopsy) in 16 women. None of the lesions fit the criteria for
MRI BI-RADS assessment category 3.
Seventeen suspicious lesions in 16 women were biop-
sied (Fig. 1; Table 4) of which 7 were malignant in 6

 women for a PPV3 of 41.2%. Four women were diagnosed
with
invasive
carcinoma
(mean
size
1.9 cm,
range
0.7–4.1), all node negative, and three lesions in two women
were ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) (one with two areas
in different quadrants) (Table 3). Although 2 of the 6
women had a final mammographic BI-RADS assessment of
three prior to the MRI (one with a small nodule and the
other with focal asymmetry), these mammographic find-
ings were unrelated to the malignancies detected by MRI.
All six malignancies found on MRI were among the 367
women with dense breasts for an incremental cancer
detection rate of 16.3 per 1000 in this subpopulation. One
additional woman, also with dense tissue, had atypical
ductal hyperplasia on MRI biopsy and excision. No biop-
sies were prompted by MRI findings in anyone with non-
dense breasts. Nine of the biopsied lesions were benign,
mean size 1.2 cm, range 0.6–2.0. All pathology reports
were reviewed and concordant with MRI findings.
Evaluation of lesion intensities: development
of the MRI abbreviated protocol (Charts 1, 2;
Table 5)
Chart 1 is a plot of intensities of every biopsied lesion
demonstrating each acquisition’s ability to maximize con-
spicuity and thereby maximize morphologic evaluation.
Based on lesion enhancement only, the subtraction images
surpassed all other acquisitions in this process.
Expressed in Chart 2 (using Table 5), T2 images help
differentiate cysts (8.77, p \ 0.0001), fibroadenomas (3.5,
p \ 0.05), lipomas (11.11) and fat necrosis (16.67) from
suspicious lesions, and T1-pre images help differentiate the
presence of lymph nodes (8.08, p \ 0.001), fibroadenomas
(5.92, p \ 0.005), fat necrosis (25.00) and dilated ducts
(8.33). Of the three pre-contrast acquisitions, STIR images
were of less utility to differentiate any non-suspicious
lesion from suspicious lesions relative to either T2 or T1-
pre. Clinically, these findings are supported by STIR’s
inability to identify lipomas as the fat signal is suppressed.
Regarding fat necrosis and cysts, STIR acquisitions added
no additional information that T2 or T1-pre images did not
provide. Further, the characteristic pattern of dilated ducts,
observed on multiple adjacent images, is so recognizable
on all other acquisitions, other than T2, that STIR acqui-
sitions are not necessary in this regard. While visualization
of lymph nodes was good on STIR images, lymph nodes
were better seen on T11 and T12 subtraction images, and
evaluation of the hila for the presence of fat was only
possible on T2 images. Diagnosing fibroadenomas involves
identification of internal non-enhancing septations best
observed on post-contrast images, supported by the same
observation on T2 images, which are not seen on STIR
images. Lastly, the ability to raise suspicion for cancer by
identifying a low signal surrounded by non-suppressed fat
(a higher signal) on T2 images is also not possible with
STIR acquisitions. Therefore, STIR acquisitions are not
deemed a necessary part of the AP.
Of the post-contrast acquisitions, T11 and T12 subtrac-
tion images had the highest ratios in four categories—cysts
(43.60, p \ 0.0001), lipoma (25.00), fat necrosis (25.00),
duct (25.00) (Chart 2). Further, the intensities and ratios for
T11 and T12 subtraction images are identical to each other
in all categories for both suspicious and non-suspicious
lesions. Therefore, a single T11.5 acquisition is sufficient to
capture early lesion enhancement in place of T11 and T12.
T16 subtraction and T1HiRes were identical in their
ability to differentiate the seven categories from suspicious
lesions but to a lesser degree than T11 and T12 subtraction.
Of these two acquisitions, T16 is necessary for develop-
ment of important kinetic curves discussed below. Further,
morphologic scores (Table 5), recorded using T1HiRes
images, were low (range 1.00–1.49) as a result of dense

 tissue obscuring lesion margins and/or small lesions for
which margins could not be evaluated. Also, Chart 1,
T1HiRes images are less intense than subtraction images for
morphologic evaluation. Therefore, the T11.5 subtraction
image can replace the function of the T1HiRes acquisition.
Kinetic evaluation
The importance of evaluating kinetic activity, expressed as
curves and reported in Chart 2, is demonstrated by its
excellent differentiating ability, associated with very low
p values, for five of the lesion categories. The T1-pre,
T11.5, and T16 acquisitions (used to create the curves for
kinetic evaluation) were mandatory for kinetic evaluation
and, consequently, proved to be important to retain in the
AP.
BPE: a special circumstance
None of the acquisitions were of help in distinguishing
BPE from a suspicious process (Chart 2). Further, kinetic
evaluation is of no help as the activity of any of these tiny
foci cannot be accurately determined as a result of size/
volume averaging during the post-process development of
kinetic curves. Therefore, the diagnosis of BPE must be on
the basis of identifying the classic distribution of these tiny
enhancing foci within one or both breasts and not on the
basis of kinetic activity or intensity on any given
acquisition.
The developed AP
Our evaluative process led to the following 4 acquisitions
for the AP: T2, T1-pre prior to contrast, and post-contrast
T11.5, and T16 (necessary for kinetic curve calculation).
Maintaining T2 as the first acquisition would preclude
efficiency of the AP. Therefore, this acquisition, unaffected
by contrast, can be placed in the time gap between T11.5
and T16 as the final step in the development of the AP
(Fig. 2). This reduces scan time from 24 to 7.5 min. Using
such an AP, all 7 malignancies and 10 suspicious benign
lesions would have been identified. For institutions using
T15 verses T16 for evaluating kinetic activity, scan time
would be 6.5 min.
Discussion
Due to overlapping tissue, lesions can be mischaracterized
on mammography or missed altogether contributing to an
initial PPV of recall of 4.2% (PPV1) [15]. Only after
additional diagnostic imaging does PPV increase to 23.9%

 for biopsies recommended (PPV2) and 27.9% for biopsies
actually performed (PPV3) [15]. The benefit of digital
mammography over film screen is primarily limited to a
subset of women of age \
50 years with minimally
improved PPV3 [16]. More recently, tomosynthesis has
been promoted as a better screening modality. However, it
only improves PPV1 to 6.4% and PPV3 to 29.2% [17] and
continues use of ionizing radiation [18].
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first prospec-
tive clinical study investigating breast MRI in a general
unselected female population after a negative routine
mammogram that used that data to develop an AP by
analyzing all lesions (suspicious and non-suspicious)
missed by negative routine mammography. The findings
were provocative in that all six cancers were found in the
367 women who had dense breasts at a rate of 16.3 per
1000 MRI examinations in this subset. For women with
non-dense breasts, MRI did not identify any suspicious
lesions. This suggests that MRI and mammography appear
to serve distinct populations that could guide its future
utilization.
A reported concern for screening with MRI is decreased
specificity leading to increased false positives. Our stan-
dardized reading criteria (Table 1) ensured consistency and
reproducibility which resulted in no repeat MRIs or sup-
plementary imaging, other than imaging required for
biopsy, for a PPV3 of 41.2%. When compared to the
mammographic PPV1 of 4.2% and PPV2 of 23.9% [15],
41.2% is a large improvement for women with dense
breasts and associated with a decreased rate of unnecessary
biopsies. MRI improved detection of malignant lesions and
better characterized a multitude of mammographically
undetected benign lesions as well.
The concept of an abbreviated screening breast MRI
study was recently investigated in a mild-to-moderate risk
breast cancer population [11]. Even though our study was
conducted at the same time as that of Kuhl et al., our
approach and results differ in many respects. We evaluated

 all lesions (452) missed by screening mammography by
each acquisition, not previously investigated in this man-
ner, to identify the minimum required number of acquisi-
tions for development of the AP. Kuhl et al. tested the
empiric selection of only two acquisitions, one just before
and one just after contrast injection without the ability to
evaluate kinetic activity. Retaining kinetic/curve informa-
tion is critical to accurately evaluate all lesions which also
helped reduce unnecessary biopsies by nearly half. In a
routine screening environment, smaller lesions would be
identified in younger women, who also have more dense
tissue, decreasing the ability to evaluate morphology fur-
ther raising the importance of kinetic evaluation.

whereas in Kuhl et al. 53 of 443 women, 12%, received this

allowing for broader application to ‘‘non-experts’’. Additional
facility time, scan time, cost of extra biopsies and organiza-
tion resources to re-evaluate the 12% recalled in Kuhl’s et al.
study, in conjunction with patient’s time and anxiety, likely
outweigh the scan time advantage of 3.1 verses 7.5 min.
Multiple other centers have attempted to develop and
evaluate an abbreviated MRI breast protocol; however,
these were performed retrospectively, studied less gener-
alizable populations (i.e., already had a cancer diagnosis),
were not built upon a screening population in which lesions
were missed on mammography, and did not analyze each
independent acquisition by lesion category or evaluate the
impact an abbreviated protocol might have on benign
lesion identification [19–22]. Moschetta et al. studied a
mixed population of patients referred for screening, prob-
lem solving, and preoperative staging, thus increasing the
pre-test probability of finding cancer when imaged with
MRI and obscuring the analysis [19]. Heacock et al. only
utilized a population with a confirmed breast cancer diag-
nosis—some of which already had breast biopsy clips at
the time of the MRI—thus also eliminating the ability to
design an abbreviated protocol to help distinguish malig-
nant and benign lesions if used in a screening setting [20].
Harvey et al. and Grimm et al. only studied the abbreviated
MRI in a high-risk population, again limiting its applica-
bility to a general screening environment [21, 22].
Most significantly, in these retrospective studies, there
was an empiric selection of acquisitions as opposed to a
more systematic approach to identify those that would have
the highest yield when used on women within a screening
environment. Furthermore, none of these studies identified
the value and impact of breast density and its interaction
with the usefulness with MRI.
Recent attention has also focused on bilateral whole
breast ultrasound as a screening modality. The median
ultrasound scan time in a high-risk population is reported
by Berg et al. as 19 min [23], which is considerably greater
than the AP MRI scan time of 7.5 min. In terms of effec-
tiveness when studied as a screening modality in a high-
risk population, Kuhl et al. reported a PPV for ultrasound
of 11 versus 50% for MRI, sensitivity for ultrasound of 40
versus 91% for MRI, and specificity for ultrasound of 90.5
versus 97.2% for MRI [7]. Prospective comparisons such
as this clearly demonstrate that ultrasound does not have
the accuracy of MRI. This was also further reflected by
Hooley et al. in which these investigators found a screening
ultrasound yield in women with dense breasts of only 3.2
per 1000 women [24].
Studies suggest mammography is more sensitive for
DCIS [25, 26] related to calcifications. However, another
series found MRI had improved sensitivity for intermedi-
ate/high-grade DCIS over mammography [27]. DCIS not
initially identified (i.e., low grade) will likely not be clin-
ically significant or need aggressive management for which
MRI screening can continue.
Even though the participants were drawn from a general
population of 1200 women, only 56% accepted, which
introduces the possibility of selection bias. While this rate
of enrollment is similar to a prior MRI study in high-risk
women [5, 28], the women willing to undergo MRI may
have different baseline characteristics. Twenty-one percent
had a first-degree relative with breast cancer, higher than
the national average of 15% [29]. However, among the
women diagnosed with breast cancer in our study, only
17% had a positive family history, similar to the national
average.
At the time this study was performed, film technology
was used by many facilities and considered an appropriate
standard of care. Studies have since shown digital mam-
mography can benefit certain populations [16] leading it to
become the current standard. That being said, the degree of
benefit from film to digital mammography is a fraction of
the benefit we have demonstrated from film mammography
to MRI. Compared to mammography, the benefit of MRI is
most apparent in women with dense breasts, a population
with well-documented challenges in all forms of mam-
mographic imaging.
Finally, funding of the project was available for
approximately 700 breast MRI examinations. Rather than
apply these funds to 350 women with 350 follow-up studies
of those same women, we elected to maximize the number
of data points by scanning 671 women one time. Thus, a
follow-up period was not part of our IRB approved study
which does not allow for calculation of sensitivity, speci-
ficity, and negative predictive values.
Once our AP has been validated in an independent
cohort, and used strictly in a baseline/screening environ-
ment, it will abbreviate MRI scanner time, reduce costs,
and should reduce biopsies and time for reader interpreta-
tion. By retaining kinetic evaluation, our protocol allows
for better lesion characterization and simplifies interpreta-
tion without detrimentally effecting overall patient/facility
throughput.
Significant potential exists to improve breast cancer
survival by rapid screening of women with dense breasts
using this abbreviated MRI protocol and could be a sup-
plement or even surrogate to mammographic screening of
women with dense breasts, whereas mammographic tech-
nology will continue to remain the standard of care for
women with fatty breasts or those that become fatty with
advancing age [30].
