SUMMARY
Adipose tissue (AT) has previously been identified as
an extra-medullary reservoir for normal hematopoie-
tic stem cells (HSCs) and may promote tumor de-
velopment. Here, we show that a subpopulation of
leukemic stem cells (LSCs) can utilize gonadal adi-
pose tissue (GAT) as a niche to support their meta-
bolism and evade chemotherapy. In a mouse model
of blast crisis chronic myeloid leukemia (CML),
adipose-resident LSCs exhibit a pro-inflammatory
phenotype and induce lipolysis in GAT. GAT lipolysis
fuels fatty acid oxidation in LSCs, especially within a
subpopulation expressing the fatty acid transporter
CD36. CD36+ LSCs have unique metabolic proper-
ties, are strikingly enriched in AT, and are protected
from chemotherapy by the GAT microenvironment.
CD36 also marks a fraction of human blast crisis
CML and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells with
similar biological properties. These findings suggest
striking interplay between leukemic cells and AT to
create a unique microenvironment that supports
the metabolic demands and survival of a distinct
LSC subpopulation.
INTRODUCTION
Clinical studies have shown that survival for obese leukemia pa-
tients is poor relative to normal-weight patients (Gelelete et al.,
2011; Meloni et al., 2001), suggesting that leukemia cells residing
in adipose tissue (AT) may be more resistant to treatment and
therefore contribute to disease persistence or relapse. Further,
numerous studies have demonstrated the unique biology of
the AT microenvironment (B1ogowski et al., 2012). However,
the nature of interactions between leukemia cells and AT is
poorly understood and was, therefore, the focus of studies
described herein.
AT is multifunctional. It serves as a storage site for lipids and
also functions as an endocrine organ (Rosen and Spiegelman,
2014). Besides its canonical role in the regulation of systemic
metabolism, AT is thought to play a role in the development
and progression of solid tumors through various mechanisms
(Khandekar et al., 2011). For example, in obese patients, AT con-
tributes to the chronic inflammatory state that induces DNA
damage and leads to colon carcinogenesis by production of
pro-inflammatory cytokines (adipokines) (Kiraly et al., 2015;
Meira et al., 2008). Further, AT has been reported to facilitate
the metastasis of ovarian cancer through regulating cancer cell
fatty acid metabolism as well as to promote the progression of
breast cancer through modulating tumor microenvironment stro-
mal components (Iyengar et al., 2005; Nieman et al., 2011). While
these studies suggest a supportive role of AT in multiple steps of
carcinogenesis, the biological behaviors of AT are, in turn,
altered by cancer cells. For instance, cancer cell-derived cyto-
kines cause lipolysis of AT, leading to tissue atrophy, which is
a hallmark of cancer cachexia syndrome (Das et al., 2011; Pet-
ruzzelli et al., 2014). Together, these findings imply an interplay
between solid tumors and AT. Whether there is a similar relation-
ship between AT and leukemia cells is not yet clear.
A recently identified function of AT is its role as a reservoir for
stem cells, including hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) (Han et al.,
2010), suggesting the presence of a distinct HSC niche. Interest-
ingly, stromal components in AT are similar to those in the bone
marrow (BM), which are essential regulators of HSC homeosta-
sis (B1ogowski et al., 2012). Further, AT secretes multiple cyto-
kines, such as CXCL12, to recruit and maintain the function of
HSCs (Kim et al., 2014). Leukemia stem cells (LSCs) co-opt the
HSC marrow environment to gain survival benefits through hi-
jacking the mechanisms utilized by HSCs to maintain homeosta-
sis. For instance, disruption of interactions between LSCs and
their stromal components, such as the extracellular matrix
(ECM), is an effective means to eradicate LSCs (Jin et al.,
2006). Further, studies have shown that leukemia cells are pro-
tected from oxidative stress by stromal cells in the microenviron-
ment via regulation of cysteine metabolism (Zhang et al., 2012b).
These studies led us to hypothesize that the AT HSC niche may
be co-opted by LSCs to support their unique metabolic needs.
Stem cells have unique metabolic characteristics, which are
accommodated by the microenvironment (Ito and Suda, 2014).
For example, a hypoxic microenvironment is required for HSCs
to utilize glycolysis as their main energy pathway, and disruption

 of either the hypoxic niche or glycolysis in HSCs results in
impaired stem cell functions (Mantel et al., 2015; Takubo et al.,
2013). Further, HSCs show an increased reliance on fatty acid
metabolism. Inhibition of fatty acid oxidation (FAO) in HSCs
leads to attenuation of stem cell capability (Ito et al., 2012; Ta-
kubo et al., 2013). The degree to which LSC biology is influenced
by the microenvironment remains largely unknown. Interestingly,
AT is capable of regulating metabolism of resident cells through
several mechanisms to promote the survival and growth of
cancer cells. For example, AT protects acute lymphoid leukemia
(ALL) cells from L-asparaginase by regulating glutamine meta-
bolism (Ehsanipour et al., 2013). Additionally, AT produces
several metabolism-regulating adipokines, such as leptin and
adiponectin, whose receptors are commonly expressed by ma-
lignant cells to modulate cancer cell metabolism (Vansaun,
2013). These findings suggest a metabolic regulatory role of AT
and prompted us to examine a potential effect of AT on LSC
metabolism.
In the present study, we show that gonadal adipose tissue
(GAT) serves as a reservoir for LSCs. We find that the interplay
between resident leukemia cells and GAT results in lipolysis,
which in turn fuels the fatty acid metabolism of leukemia cells.
Further, we observe a distinct LSC subpopulation expressing
the fatty acid transporter CD36. CD36+ cells demonstrate a rela-
tively high level of FAO, have a quiescent and drug-resistant pro-
file, and are protected by GAT from chemotherapy. Additionally,
we find CD36 enhances leukemic colonization of GAT and also
contributes to chemo-resistance of LSCs.
RESULTS
Adipose Tissue Functions as a Reservoir for LSCs
A murine model of blast crisis chronic myeloid leukemia (bcCML)
was used in this study to investigate the interplay between leuke-
mia cells and AT. The system employs co-expression of the
BCR-ABL and Nup98-HOXA9 translocations, each indepen-
dently monitored using GFP and yellow fluorescent protein
(YFP) expression, respectively (Figures S1A and S1B). These
translocations are detected in human bcCML, and the model
has previously been described in detail for studies of leukemia
genetics and stem cell biology (Ashton et al., 2012; Dash et al.,
2002; Mayotte et al., 2002; Neering et al., 2007).
To investigate the presence of leukemia cells in AT, animals
were established using the bcCML model. At advanced stages
of disease, cells were isolated from both GAT and inguinal adi-
pose tissue (IAT). GAT represents the largest visceral fat depot
in mice, and IAT is the most prevalent reservoir of subcutaneous
fat. In addition, several hematopoietic tissues were isolated for
comparison, including BM, spleen, and peripheral blood (PB).
Interestingly, the data show that leukemia cells are readily evident
in GAT but only present at very low levels in IAT (Figure 1A). These
data suggest that AT microenvironments may differ substantially
with regard to their ability to attract and/or support leukemia cells,
a finding supported by previous studies in which biological prop-
erties of IAT and GAT have been shown to differ substantially
(Tchkonia et al., 2013). To further characterize GAT as a reservoir
for leukemia cells, histological analyses were performed (Fig-
ure 1B). Leukemia cells are observed in direct contact with adipo-
cytes and are prevalent throughout the AT.
We next asked whether LSCs were also found in GAT. As re-
ported in previous studies a Sca-1+/Lin� phenotype encom-
passes all detectable LSCs in the bcCML model (Ashton et al.,
2012; Neering et al., 2007). We observed enrichment of pheno-
typically defined LSCs in GAT relative to the hematopoietic tis-
sues (Figure 1C). To investigate the level of functionally defined
LSCs, the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) was isolated from
leukemic GAT, which represents an adipocyte-depleted tissue
suspension. Transplantation of SVF into recipient mice showed
robust development of leukemia as evidenced by GFP+/YFP+
cells in BM, GAT, and spleen (Figure S1C). Limiting-dilution
transplantation assays indicate that the frequency of LSCs is
slightly higher in GAT-derived leukemia cells compared to
BM-resident leukemia cells (Figure 1D). Finally, we investigated
the composition of leukemic populations that migrate to GAT.
Homing assays demonstrated that LSCs are significantly en-
riched in leukemia cells that localize to GAT (Figure 1E). Taken
together, these findings indicate that GAT functions as a reser-
voir for leukemia cells.
Leukemia Cells in GAT Are Pro-inflammatory
To gain insight into the characteristics of LSCs in AT, we
compared transcriptomes of sorted LSCs from GAT, BM, PB,
spleen, and their non-leukemic counterparts from BM (NBM)
by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). The data indicate that LSCs in
GAT display a distinct gene expression pattern (Figure 2A) char-
acterized by strong upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines/
chemokines (Figure S2A). The most strongly upregulated pro-in-
flammatory genes are shown in Figure 2B. The leukemic GAT
SVF also shows strong upregulation of pro-inflammatory genes
in comparison to controls (Figure S2B). To ensure that non-
leukemic cells were not contributing to the pro-inflammatory
phenotype, we also examined expression in the GFP�/YFP�
population derived from GAT SVF in leukemic mice (Figure 2C).
In comparison to naive GAT SVF, cytokine/chemokine levels
are actually somewhat lower, further indicating that the inflam-
matory state of GAT is due to resident leukemia cells in SVF
(Figure 2C).
One possible physiological consequence of an altered inflam-
matory state could be increased mobilization of free fatty acids
(FFAs) from AT. Notably, we observed severe atrophy of GAT
(Figure 2D) as well as loss of body weight (Figure S2C) in
leukemic mice. Additionally, despite only a low level of leukemia
cells, atrophy of IAT was observed as well (Figure S2D). Further
analyses indicated that in contrast to GAT, the non-leukemic
population from IAT SVF in leukemic mice is more pro-inflamma-
tory than IAT SVF in normal mice (Figure S2E). Together, these
findings indicate cachexia in leukemic mice, where systemic
factors lead to weight loss in organs that do not display large leu-
kemia cell burden. Interestingly, we also observed that atrophy
of GAT precedes body weight loss during the early stage of leu-
kemia development (Figures S2F and S2G).
To examine whether similar symptoms are observed in other
leukemic models, we utilized an MLL-AF9-induced leukemia
model in which LSCs have been shown to arise in the granulo-
cyte-macrophage progenitor compartment (GMP) (Krivtsov
et al., 2006). This model differs from the bcCML model, where
previous studies have shown that the HSC/multipotent progeni-
tor (MPP) compartment represents the cell of origin (Neering
24
Cell Stem Cell 19, 23–37, July 7, 2016
 et al., 2007). Similar to what we found in the blast crisis model,
loss of body weight as well as atrophy of GAT was observed in
leukemic mice (Figures S2H and S2I). However, leukemic burden
in GAT for the MLL-AF9 model is considerably lower than that in
BM (Figure S2J), similar to our findings for IAT in the bcCML
model. These findings suggest that localization to GAT may be
dependent on both the leukemia cell of origin (i.e., HSC versus
GMP) and the specific oncogenes that drive the malignant trans-
formation process.
Leukemic Adipose Tissue Is Lipolytic
Next, we focused on possible mechanisms controlling atrophy
of GAT. Previous studies have indicated that lipolysis is mainly
responsible for atrophy of AT in the setting of cancer (Das
et al., 2011). To test whether leukemic GAT is lipolytic, we
cultured GAT explants from control and leukemic mice and
monitored lipolysis rates. As shown in Figure 3A, leukemic
GAT releases much more FFAs than control GAT. In addition,
fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4), which facilitates the

by

ated by detection of an elevated serum FFA level in leukemic
mice (Figure 3B). We also found that leukemic serum is a
potent inducer of lipolysis in 3T3-L1 adipocytes as well as
in
normal

explants
(Figure
S3A).
Together,
these
findings strongly support the conclusion that leukemic GAT
is lipolytic.
To determine the molecular basis of lipolysis in leukemic
GAT, we examined the expression of lipolysis-related genes.
Comparison of control and leukemic GAT showed increased
expression of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), the gene
that encodes the rate-limiting enzyme in lipolysis (Das et al.,
2011) (Figures 3C and 3D). Further, in leukemic GAT, we
observed reduced expression of the negative regulators of
lipolysis lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and cell death activator
CIDE-A (CIDEA) (Figures 3C and 3D). LPL controls the influx
of FFAs into adipocytes (Ebadi and Mazurak, 2014). CIDEA
is a lipid droplet (LD)-associated protein that shields LDs
from lipases and thus inhibits lipolysis (Nordstro
¨ m et al.,
2005). These results suggest that leukemic GAT triggers a
lipolytic program that induces release of FFAs and mobiliza-
tion of lipids that leads to atrophy of GAT.
To determine if inflammatory factors directly mediate lipolysis,
we treated 3T3-L1 adipocytes as well as normal GAT explants
with

of
the
pro-inflammatory
cytokines/chemokines
elevated in GAT. As shown in Figures 3E and S3B, tumor necro-
sis factor a (TNF-a), interleukin 1a (IL-1a), IL-1b, and CSF2 are

capable of inducing lipolysis. Further-
more, these
four cytokines result in
reduced expression of both LPL and
CIDEA in GAT explants and 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Figures 3F and
S3C). Additionally, analysis of conditioned medium (CM) from
control and leukemic GAT explants as well as serum from control
and leukemic mice showed increased secretion of IL-1a, IL-1b,
TNF-a, and CSF2 (Figures 3G and S3D). These findings suggest
that TNF-a, IL-1a, IL-1b, and CSF2 secreted by leukemia cells
mediates lipolysis.
In addition to the pro-inflammatory cytokines outlined above,
we note that fatty acid itself can be a potent pro-inflammatory
agent (Snodgrass et al., 2013). Therefore, we hypothesized
that FFAs from lipolysis would further exacerbate inflamma-
tion-induced lipolysis. Indeed, we found that leukemia cells
treated with palmitate (PA) have increased expression of IL-1a
and IL-1b, while normal BM hematopoietic cells do not (Fig-
ure 3H). Conversely, unsaturated fatty acid such as oleic acid
(OA) has been reported to have anti-inflammatory effect (Finu-
cane et al., 2015). We observed that OA represses mRNA
expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in normal cells (Fig-
ure S3E); however, this repression is not seen in leukemia cells
(Figure S3E). Additionally, one recent study reported the induc-
tion of IL-1a by OA through an inflammasome-independent
pathway
(Freigang
et
al.,
2013).
Interestingly,
we
found
that OA, but not PA, is able to induce IL-1a protein production
in leukemia cells (Figure 3I).
Together, these observations indicate that resident leukemia
cells contribute to the lipolytic status of GAT by disrupting lipid
metabolism in GAT through paracrine signaling of pro-inflamma-
tory cytokines.

 Fatty Acid Oxidation Is Elevated in LSCs
Next, we asked how leukemia cells might benefit from lipolysis of
AT. We hypothesized that increased FFAs from lipolysis could
serve as an energy source for leukemia cells both in GAT and
possibly in other tissues. To investigate this hypothesis, we
compared the ability of leukemic versus non-leukemic cells to
utilize fatty acid. As shown in Figure 4A, leukemia cells have a
higher FAO rate compared to control non-leukemia cells.
Furthermore, in examining various cell subpopulations, our
data show that LSCs have a higher FAO rate than either more
differentiated leukemia cells (Lin+ leukemia cells) or their coun-
terparts from normal hematopoietic cells (Figure 4B). Interest-
ingly, treatment of leukemic and normal cells with adipocyte
conditioned medium (CM) selectively increases FAO rate in
LSCs (Figure 4B). Etomoxir, a CPT1 inhibitor, inhibits FAO in
both leukemia cells and normal cells (Figure 4B). Of note, eto-
moxir only reduces FAO in LSCs by �60%, suggesting that
peroxisomal FAO contributes to a substantial part of the overall
FAO in LSCs. In addition, we noticed that LSCs exhibit the high-
est FAO rate when fatty acid serves as the only energy substrate
(Figure S4A).
CD36, a Fatty Acid Transporter, Modulates Energy
Metabolism in Leukemia Cells
To gain insights into the mechanism underlying the high FAO
rate in LSCs, we compared the expression of FAO-related
genes in LSCs, Lin+ leukemia cells, and their non-leukemic
counterparts. LSCs show a distinct expression pattern of
the FAO-related genes (Figure S4B). Specifically, we found
one of the fatty acid transporters, CD36, is highly expressed
by LSCs (Figures S4B, S4C, and 4C), suggesting that CD36
may contribute to the increased FAO in LSCs. Notably,
CD36 is not expressed uniformly in the LSC population, indi-
cating that there may be heterogeneity in the stem cell
compartment. To investigate a possible role for CD36 in
LSCs, we first asked whether CD36-dependent fatty acid
transport was evident in both leukemic and normal hemato-
poietic cells. To this end, we showed that purified CD36+/Lin�
leukemia cells demonstrate a higher fatty acid uptake rate and
are preferentially sensitive to the CD36 inhibitor sulfosuccini-
midyl oleate (SSO) compared to CD36�/Lin� leukemia cells
(Figure S4C). Additionally, using a fluorescent long-chain fatty
acid analog, BODIPY-dodecanoic acid (Liao et al., 2005), we
showed that CD36+/Lin� normal cells have a higher fatty
acid uptake rate and are more sensitive to SSO compared
to CD36�/Lin� cells (Figure S4E). These results suggest that
CD36 functions as a fatty acid transporter in both leukemic
and normal hematopoietic cells. Next, we asked whether
CD36 regulates FAO in LSCs. We found that the FAO rate in
total LSCs is selectively reduced by SSO, while FAO rates in
Lin+ leukemia cells and their normal counterparts are not (Fig-
ure 4D). Subsequent isolation of CD36+ versus CD36� sub-
populations showed that CD36+ LSCs have a much higher
FAO rate and are more sensitive to SSO than CD36� LSCs
(Figures S4F and 4E).
Taken together, these results indicate that the fatty acid trans-
porter CD36 differentially regulates FAO in LSCs. Furthermore,
FAO in different LSC sub-fractions seems to be regulated by
different mechanisms.
CD36 Expression Segregates LSCs into Two Distinct
Populations
Since CD36+ LSCs have a high requirement for fatty acid and
there is abundant FFAs in the GAT microenvironment, we hy-
pothesized that CD36+ LSCs might preferentially localize to
GAT. Indeed, we found that CD36+ LSCs are strikingly enriched
in GAT (Figure 5A). Further, CD36+ LSCs have a higher tendency
to migrate to GAT than to BM (Figure 5B), while homing to BM is
comparable between CD36+ and CD36� LSCs (Figure S5A).
The presence of phenotypically primitive CD36+ and CD36�
subsets raised the question of whether one or both populations
contain true functionally defined LSCs. To investigate this issue,
CD36+ versus CD36� populations were isolated by flow cytom-
etry and used in transplantation assays. As shown in Figure 5C,
both populations were able to recapitulate bulk leukemic disease
in secondary recipients. Similarly, when cultured in vitro, these
two populations were also able to recreate each other (Fig-
ure S5B). Additionally, limiting-dilution transplantation assays
indicated a comparable LSC frequency between CD36+ and
CD36� populations (Figure 5D). These findings demonstrate
that there are at least two phenotypically distinct types of
LSCs in the blast crisis model employed for these studies.
Notably, phenotypically distinct LSCs have recently been re-
ported within primary human leukemia specimens (Eppert
et al., 2011; Sarry et al., 2011).
Next, we examined relative metabolic status. As shown in Fig-
ure S5C, CD36+ LSCs have a lower ATP content than CD36�
LSCs, even though their mitochondrial mass is comparable
(Figure S5D). We further examined the response of each popula-
tion to metabolic stress. CD36+ LSCs are more sensitive to
2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) and more resistant to the complex I
inhibitor rotenone compared to CD36� LSCs (Figure S5E), sug-
gesting the CD36+ cells are more dependent on glycolysis.
These observations indicate that CD36+ and CD36� LSCs are
metabolically distinct.
The metabolic properties of CD36+ LSCs (high FAO rate, low
ATP level, and sensitivity to inhibition of glycolysis) resemble
the metabolic characteristics of quiescent HSCs (Ito et al.,
2012; Takubo et al., 2013). Cell-cycle analyses showed that
CD36+ LSCs are relatively quiescent in comparison to the
CD36� subpopulation (Figure 5E). In agreement with this result,
CD36+ LSCs have higher expression of cell-cycle inhibitors and
lower expression of cell-cycle promoters (Figure S5F). Interest-
ingly, we do not detect any surface expression of CD36 in normal
stem/progenitor populations (Figure S5G), suggesting CD36 is
preferentially utilized by a subpopulation of LSCs.
Collectively, these findings indicate that at least two metabol-
ically distinct types of leukemia-initiating cells exist in the blast
crisis model and that energy metabolism can differ as a function
of anatomical location and expression of CD36.
CD36+ LSCs Are Drug Resistant and Protected from
Chemotherapy by GAT
Since most conventional chemotherapy agents preferentially
target cycling cells, we hypothesized that the more quiescent
CD36+ LSCs would be relatively drug resistant. To test this hy-
pothesis, we monitored the viability of CD36+ LSCs, CD36�
LSCs and bulk leukemia cells upon ex vivo treatment with
different chemotherapeutic drugs, including cytarabine (Ara-C),

 doxorubicin, etoposide, SN-38, and irinotecan (CPT-11), as well
as the kinase inhibitor dasatinib. We found that all LSCs, both
CD36+ and CD36�, were more drug resistant than bulk leukemia
cells (Figure S5H). Furthermore, compared to CD36� LSCs,
CD36+ LSCs were preferentially drug resistant (Figure S5H). To
determine whether drug resistance was also evident in vivo,
we treated leukemic mice using a regimen that models the treat-
ment for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients (Zuber et al.,
2009) and improves survival of leukemic mice (Figure 5F). We

 enriched in BM residual leukemia cells while CD36� LSCs are not
(Figure 5G), suggesting that CD36+ LSCs are more drug re-
sistant. Analysis of CD36+ LSCs in GAT also showed strong
enrichment after chemotherapy (Figure 5G). Intriguingly, the per-
centage of CD36+ LSCs in GAT is even higher than BM while the
percentage of CD36� LSCs in GAT is reduced (Figure 5G), sug-
gesting preferential survival of CD36+ LSCs in GAT. Together,
these findings show that CD36+ LSCs are drug resistant and pro-
tected by GAT, implying that the heterogeneity found in LSCs
is directly related to drug response in different leukemic sub-
populations.
Loss of CD36 Decreases Leukemic Burden in GAT and
Sensitizes LSCs to Chemotherapy
We next investigated whether CD36 plays a role in leukemia
migration to GAT. First, we examined LSCs in the MLL-AFP
model, where migration to GAT was relatively low. Notably, while
CD36 was expressed in some bulk tumor cells, there was no
CD36 expression in the LSC populations (Figure S6A). Thus,
lack of CD36 correlates with poor infiltration of GAT. To further
explore this issue, we established the bcCML model using
marrow cells derived from a CD36 knockout (CD36KO) mouse
strain (Figure S6B). As shown in Figure 6A, leukemic burden is
significantly lower in GAT from animals transplanted with
CD36KO leukemia cells compared to leukemia derived from
wild-type (WT) cells.
Importantly, the difference between
CD36KO and WT leukemia cells was only evident in GAT,
whereas all other tissues examined (BM, spleen, and PB)
showed no difference as a function of CD36 (Figures 6A and
S6C). Additionally, no difference was found in the frequency of
phenotypically defined LSCs between WT and CD36KO leuke-
mia cells in different tissues (Figures 6B and S6D). Consistent
with the decreased leukemic burden in GAT, cachexia symp-
toms were reduced in knockout (KO) leukemia mice. We
observed less body weight loss (Figure S6E) as well as less atro-
phy of both GAT and IAT in KO leukemia mice compared to WT
leukemia mice (Figures 6C and S6F). The serum FFA level is also
lower in KO leukemia mice (Figure 6D). Interestingly, CD36KO
leukemia cells produce lower amounts of IL-1a compared to
WT leukemia cells in both unstimulated and OA-stimulated
conditions (Figure 6E), which potentially explains the reduced
cachexia in KO leukemia mice. Together, these findings indicate
that the mobilization of fatty acid from AT in KO leukemia mice is
reduced.
To determine whether the decreased leukemia burden in GAT
from KO leukemia mice is due to compromised migration to GAT,
we performed homing assays and found that CD36KO LSCs are
less localized to GAT compared to WT LSCs (Figure 6F), while
there are no differences in the homing ability to BM (Figure S6G).
In terms of metabolic activity, we examined whether fatty acid
uptake and FAO are impaired in CD36KO leukemia cells. As
shown in Figure S6H, fatty acid uptake is decreased in
CD36KO Lin� leukemia cells compared to their WT counterparts.
Further, FAO rate in CD36KO LSCs is significantly lower and less
sensitive to the CD36 inhibitor SSO compared to WT LSCs
(Figure 6G).
Lastly, we asked whether loss of CD36 would affect LSC drug
sensitivity. We first examined viability of LSCs upon ex vivo treat-
ment. CD36KO LSCs are more sensitive to chemotherapeutic
drugs (Figure S6I). To test whether CD36KO LSCs are drug sen-
sitive in vivo, we applied the same chemotherapeutic regimen
shown in Figure 5F to WT and KO leukemia mice. We found there
are more residual leukemia cells in BM of WT leukemia mice
compared to KO leukemia mice after chemotherapy (Figure 6H).
Furthermore, LSCs are enriched in BM of WT leukemia mice,
while similar results are not observed in KO leukemia mice (Fig-
ure 6I). Together, our data suggest that CD36 contributes to the
survival of LSCs.
CD36 Expression Segregates Primitive Human bcCML
and AML Cells into Two Functionally Distinct
Populations
Finally, we asked whether our findings in the murine model could
be recapitulated in human bcCML cells. To this end, we first
examined the expression of CD36 in the CD34+ leukemic
compartment, which is typically enriched for primitive leukemia
cells. Of the eight primary human specimens available for anal-
ysis, four had readily detectable CD36+ cells in the CD34+ pop-
ulation (bcCML1, 5, 6, and 8) (Figure 7A). Using the fluorescent
fatty acid analog BODIPY-dodecanoic acid, we found in all
four samples that the CD36+/CD34+ population had a higher
fatty acid uptake rate and was more sensitive to the treatment
of SSO relative to CD36�/CD34+ cells (Figures 7B and S7A).
These findings suggest that CD36 functions as a fatty acid trans-
porter in human bcCML cells. Of these four samples, three had
sufficient tissue for further analyses (bcCML1, 5, and 6). We
examined the FAO rate and found that CD36+/CD34+ cells
have a higher FAO rate and are more sensitive to SSO in all three
samples (Figures 7C and S7B), indicating expression of CD36 is
linked to increased FAO, as observed in the mouse model.
To investigate infiltration of GAT, we employed a xenograft
model using transplantation of human specimens (bcCML1, 5,
and 6) into immune-deficient NOD scid gamma (NSG) mice. Of
the three specimens tested, we observed successful engraft-
ment of bone marrow for two specimens (bcCML1 and
bcCML5). The presence of human leukemia cells in GAT was
observed for both engrafted specimens (Figures 7D and S7C).
Further, we found CD36+/CD34+ cells are enriched in GAT (Fig-
ures 7E and S7D). Additionally, CD36+/CD34+ cells show greater
homing to GAT than BM, and the CD36 inhibitor SSO impairs
their homing to GAT (Figures 7F and S7E). Notably, we found
that serum FFA level is elevated in NSG mice engrafted with
bcCML cells (Figure 7G).
To determine whether there is any functional difference be-
tween CD36+ and CD36� cells, we examined the cell-cycle sta-
tus of these two populations. Consistent with results from the
murine
model,
CD36+/CD34+
cells
are
more
quiescent
compared to CD36�/CD34+ in all three samples (Figure S7F).

 We further compared their drug sensitivity in vitro and found that
CD36+/CD34+ cells are relatively drug resistant in all three sam-
ples (Figure S7G). Lastly, we asked whether CD36+/CD34+ cells
are also drug resistant in vivo. Animals engrafted with the two
specimens were treated with Ara-C for 3 days, followed by anal-
ysis of marrow cells by flow cytometry. As shown in Figures 7H
and S7H, the CD36+/CD34+ cells from both samples were rela-
tively drug resistant in vivo.
Lastly, to explore whether our findings from human bcCML
are evident in other forms of disease, we examined the role of
CD36 in eight primary samples derived from AML patients. To
provide a broad analysis, we intentionally chose a range of
AML specimen types with varying mutations and cytogenetic
abnormalities (Table S1). We first examined the expression
of CD36 in the CD34+ leukemic compartment. Similar to
bcCML, four of the eight specimens had readily detectable
CD36+ cells in the CD34+ population (greater than 1%)
(AML5, 6, 7, and 8) (Figure 7I). Further, CD36 functions as a
fatty acid transporter in all four samples (Figures 7J and
S7I). Of note, other groups have shown that in AML patients,
poor prognosis is associated with higher expression of CD36
(Perea et al., 2005), indicating a potential role of CD36 in AML
persistence or relapse.
Together, these observations suggest that in at least some
human bcCML and AML patients, CD36 also functions as a sur-
face marker to segregate metabolically and functionally distinct
primitive populations.
DISCUSSION
Despite intensive research efforts, survival for patients with
aggressive forms of myeloid leukemia remains poor. While
many studies have focused on leukemia cell-intrinsic properties
as an important challenge, an increasing number of reports have
demonstrated a key role for microenvironmental signals in the
biology and drug response of leukemia cells (Konopleva and Jor-
dan, 2011; Zhang et al., 2012a). Because an almost infinite
number of potential microenvironments may exist in mammalian
organisms, the challenge in defining how various extrinsic fac-
tors influence anti-leukemia therapies is formidable. In the pre-
sent study, we focused on AT for two reasons: (1) prognosis
for obese patients is worse, and (2) AT has previously been
shown to be a reservoir for normal HSCs (Marappagoundar
et al., 2010). These observations suggest that LSCs may reside
in AT and that the unique microenvironment found in such tissue
may protect leukemic cells from drug challenge.
To investigate the role of AT in leukemia pathogenesis, we em-
ployed a mouse model of bcCML in which LSCs have previously
been described. We also examined primary human leukemia
specimens. Collectively, these studies provide evidence sup-
porting several previously unknown aspects of leukemia biology.
First, GAT provides a unique microenvironmental niche for prim-
itive leukemia cells. Residence in the adipose niche induces a
strongly pro-inflammatory phenotype for leukemic cells, result-
ing in secretion of cytokines that elevate lipolysis and the release
of FFAs. We propose that increased FFA levels act to positively
reinforce the inflammatory condition of leukemia cells in GAT and
to fuel metabolic processes of leukemic cells in both adipose
and hematopoietic tissues, as evidenced by increased fatty
acid oxidation for LSCs in both AT and marrow. Second, we
observe that functionally defined LSCs exist in at least two
distinct forms, differing in metabolism and cell-cycle status.
The different types of LSC are characterized by expression of
CD36, where expression serves to increase uptake of fatty acids.
Intriguingly, CD36+ LSCs preferentially home to GAT, indicating
a tropism for a microenvironment in which fatty acids are most
readily available. Third, LSCs resident in GAT are preferentially
resistant to challenge with conventional chemotherapy drugs,
particularly the CD36+ LSCs, which reside in a more quiescent
cell-cycle state. Taken together, these findings support a model
in which leukemic cells co-opt AT to (1) create a microenviron-
ment that supports systemic growth of leukemic disease and
(2) provide a niche that confers a relatively drug-resistant
phenotype.
An intriguing line of future investigation will be further analysis
to determine the exact molecular details that underlie AT protec-
tion of LSCs. We speculate that regulation of resident LSC fatty
acid metabolism is one of the mechanisms, because (1) our
study shows that CD36+ drug-resistant LSCs have a higher
FAO rate, indicating interplay between FAO and drug resistance;
and (2) AT selectively regulates LSC FAO. Additionally, adipo-
kines produced by AT have shown protective effects that could
also benefit the survival of resident LSCs (Khandekar et al.,
2011). A related question is how fatty acid metabolism confers
LSC drug resistance. We propose that regulation of cellular
redox status is one possible mechanism. FAO contributes to
the cellular NADPH pool (Pike et al., 2011), which is critical for
redox balance and survival. High rates of FAO produce large
amounts of NADH and acetyl-coenzyme A, which in turn can
inhibit mitochondrial oxidative activities (Jaswal et al., 2011)
and thereby further reduce cellular oxidative stress. Lowered
oxidative state favors quiescence as well as ‘‘stemness’’ for

 leukemia cells, as demonstrated by our previous studies in hu-
man AML (Lagadinou et al., 2013). Indeed, the present studies
showed a more quiescent state for the CD36+ LSCs (Figure 5E),
consistent with their improved resistance to chemotherapy. We
also note that enzymes involved in FAO directly interact with
anti-apoptotic proteins (Giordano et al., 2005; Paumen et al.,
1997), suggesting a potential interplay between FAO and cell
survival.
An unexpected finding of our studies was the presence of two
metabolically distinct LSC subpopulations, suggesting that
metabolic heterogeneity may be an intrinsic property of leukemia
biology or pathogenesis. This finding has practical ramifications,
because we also observe differential drug response as a function
of metabolic state. If these data are corroborated with additional
studies in humans, it may be important to incorporate such
knowledge into the design of anti-leukemia therapies. In princi-
ple, to achieve complete eradication of the LSC population, it
will be necessary to employ therapies that can target metaboli-
cally distinct subpopulations. Notably, several studies have
suggested an interaction between metabolic and functional
heterogeneity. For example, long-lived and quiescent cells,
including HSCs and memory T cells, have high FAO rates, and
disruption of FAO results in dysfunction of these cells (Cui
et al., 2015; Ito et al., 2012; van der Windt et al., 2012). These
observations lead us to postulate that selective modulation of
LSC metabolism could be one component of regimens designed
to more effectively eradicate LSC populations. Indeed, previous
studies have shown that inhibition of FAO sensitizes leukemia
cells to apoptosis stimulators (Samudio et al., 2010).
In summary, our findings demonstrate that GAT in leukemia
mice functions as a reservoir for LSCs and confers chemo-resis-
tance to resident leukemia cells, implying a potential role of GAT
in the pathogenesis of leukemia and relative efficacy of thera-
peutic challenge. Furthermore, our data indicate metabolic
heterogeneity within LSC populations, where pathways control-
ling energy consumption can differ. We propose that metabolic
heterogeneity in LSCs may contribute to the challenge in effec-
tively eradicating such cells and that modulation of fatty acid
metabolism may be a promising way to eradicate LSCs.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Generation of the bcCML Mouse Model
The mouse model was created as described previously (Ashton et al., 2012;
Neering et al., 2007). Briefly, 8- to 10-week-old female naive C57Bl6J mice
were
purchased
from
Jackson
Laboratory.
BM
from
CD36KO
mice
(B6.129S1-Cd36tm1Mfe/J) were a gift from Dr. Christopher Y. Park’s lab. BM
cells were harvested and mature lineage-positive cells were depleted using
the BD IMAG immunoaffinity kit per the manufacturer’s instructions. LSK cells
were isolated using fluorescently conjugated antibodies for Sca-1 and c-Kit
and BD FACS ARIA II cell sorter. LSK cells were cultured in LSK medium
(IMDM containing 10% FBS [Thermo Fisher Scientific], 10 ng/ml IL-3 and
IL-6, 50 ng/ml SCF and Flt3L [all recombinant murine cytokines were pur-
chased from Peprotech], 13 antibiotic-antimycotic [Thermo Fisher Scientific],
and 50 mg/ml gentamicin [Thermo Fisher Scientific]) and infected with
viral supernatant twice a day for 3 days and subsequently injected
through the retro-orbital sinus into recipient 8- to 10-week-old naive B6.SJL-
PtprcaPepcb/BoyJ mice (Jackson Laboratory). BM cells and spleens cells
from leukemic mice were harvested and frozen for future usage. All animal
experiments were approved by University Committee on Animal Resources
(UCAR) at the University of Rochester and the Office of Laboratory Animal Re-
sources (OLAR) at the University of Colorado Denver.
Human bcCML Xenograft Model and Chemotherapy in NSG Mice
NSG mice (Jackson Laboratory) were transplanted with human leukemia cells
via the retro-orbital sinus (5 million/mouse). Four weeks after transplantation,
mice were treated with Ara-C (100 mg/kg/day) or saline for 3 days, and then
the composition of BM residual leukemia cells was examined.
Human Primary bcCML and AML Cells
Primary bcCML and AML cells were obtained from apheresis product, PB, or
BM of patients who gave informed consent for sample procurement. All spec-
imen acquisition was approved by the University of Colorado Institutional
Review Board.
Statistical Analysis
Biological factors were investigated for their relevance by two-tailed Student’s
t test with unpaired analysis. p < 0.05 was considered significant.
