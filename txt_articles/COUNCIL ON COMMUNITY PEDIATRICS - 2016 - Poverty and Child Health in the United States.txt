abstract
Almost half of young children in the United States live in poverty or near 
poverty. The American Academy of Pediatrics is committed to reducing 
and ultimately eliminating child poverty in the United States. Poverty and 
related social determinants of health can lead to adverse health outcomes 
in childhood and across the life course, negatively affecting physical health, 
socioemotional development, and educational achievement. The American 
Academy of Pediatrics advocates for programs and policies that have been 
shown to improve the quality of life and health outcomes for children and 
families living in poverty. With an awareness and understanding of the 
effects of poverty on children, pediatricians and other pediatric health 
practitioners in a family-centered medical home can assess the fi
 nancial 
stability of families, link families to resources, and coordinate care with 
community partners. Further research, advocacy, and continuing education 
will improve the ability of pediatricians to address the social determinants 
of health when caring for children who live in poverty. Accompanying this 
policy statement is a technical report that describes current knowledge on 
child poverty and the mechanisms by which poverty infl
 uences the health 
and well-being of children.
STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM
Poverty is an important social determinant of health and contributes to 
child health disparities. Children who experience poverty, particularly 
during early life or for an extended period, are at risk of a host of adverse 
health and developmental outcomes through their life course.1 Poverty 
has a profound effect on specific circumstances, such as birth weight, 
infant mortality, language development, chronic illness, environmental 
exposure, nutrition, and injury. Child poverty also influences genomic 
function and brain development by exposure to toxic stress, 
2 a condition 
characterized by “excessive or prolonged activation of the physiologic 
stress response systems in the absence of the buffering protection 
afforded by stable, responsive relationships.”3 Children living in poverty

are at increased risk of difficulties 
with self-regulation and executive 
function, such as inattention, 
impulsivity, defiance, and poor peer 
relationships.4 Poverty can make 
parenting difficult, especially in the 
context of concerns about inadequate 
food, energy, transportation, and 
housing.
Child poverty is associated 
with lifelong hardship. Poor 
developmental and psychosocial 
outcomes are accompanied by a 
significant financial burden, not just 
for the children and families who 
experience them but also for the 
rest of society. Children who do not 
complete high school, for example, 
are more likely to become teenage 
parents, to be unemployed, and to 
be incarcerated, all of which exact 
heavy social and economic costs.5 
A growing body of research shows 
that child poverty is associated with 
neuroendocrine dysregulation that 
may alter brain function and may 
contribute to the development of 
chronic cardiovascular, immune, and 
psychiatric disorders.6 The economic 
cost of child poverty to society can 
be estimated by anticipating future 
lost productivity and increased 
social expenditure. A study compiled 
before 2008 projected a total cost 
of approximately $500 billion each 
year through decreased productivity 
and increased costs of crime and 
health care, 
7 nearly 4% of the gross 
domestic product. Other studies of 
“opportunity youth, 
” young people 
16 to 24 years of age who are neither 
employed nor in school, derived 
similar results, generating cohort 
aggregate lifetime costs in the 
trillions.8
Child poverty is greater in the United 
States than in most countries with 
comparable resources. In a 2012 
report from the United Nations 
Children’s Fund, 
9 the United States 
ranked 34th of 35 member nations 
of the Organization for Economic 
Cooperation and Development, 
a reflection of the rate of child 
poverty during and immediately 
after the Great Recession of 
2007–2009. A later 2014 report 
from the Organization for Economic 
Cooperation and Development10 
ranked the United States 35th of 40 
nations, only above Chile, Mexico, 
Romania, Turkey, and Israel. 
This policy statement specifically 
addresses child poverty in the United 
States but reflects the 2015 United 
Nations’ Sustainability Goal to end 
poverty in all its forms everywhere.11
According to 2014 Census data, an 
estimated 21.1% of all US children 
younger than 18 years (15.5 million) 
lived in households designated as 
“poor” (ie, in 2014, incomes below 
100% of the federal poverty level 
[FPL] of $24 230 for a family of 
4*) and 42.9% (over 31.5 million) 
lived in households designated as 
“poor, near poor, or low income” 
(ie, incomes up to 200% of the FPL). 
Nearly 9.3% (6.8 million) lived in 
households of deep poverty (ie, 
incomes below 50% of the FPL).12 
In 2014, an estimated 16 million 
children lived in families who 
received Supplemental Nutrition 
Assistance Program (SNAP) 
benefits.13 Between 2007 and 2010, 
foreclosures affected 5.3 million 
children.14
Demographics have a profound 
influence on the likelihood that a 
family or community will experience 
poverty or low income. For example, 
African American, Hispanic, and 
American Indian/Alaska Native 
children are 3 times more likely to 
live in poverty than are white and 
Asian children.15 Infants and toddlers 
more commonly live in poverty than 
do older children.
Children may be born into poverty, 
remain in a poor household 
throughout childhood, or, most 
commonly, rotate in and out of 
poverty over time. Approximately 
37% of all children live in poverty 
for some period during their 
childhood.16 Children who are born 
into poverty and live persistently in 
poor conditions are at greatest risk 
of adverse outcomes. However, even 
short-term spells of poverty can 
expose children to hardships, such as 
food insecurity, housing insecurity/
homelessness, loss of health care, and 
school disruptions.
Equality of opportunity is central to 
the American dream and is reflected 
by social mobility or the potential 
of intergenerational economic 
betterment. However, social mobility 
is difficult to measure, because the 
usual method compares incomes 
of 30-year-old persons against the 
incomes of their parents. Despite the 
difficulties, most researchers agree 
that social mobility in the United 
States has faltered as the wealth 
and opportunity gaps between 
rich and poor have widened in 
the past decade. In comparison 
with European and other wealthy 
industrialized countries, social 
mobility in the United States ranks 
among the lowest.17 A 2015 Pew 
Charitable Trusts report documented 
that the effect of parental income 
advantage is persistent over all 
levels of parental income but is 
especially strong for children born to 
wealthy families. Persistent parental 
economic advantage means that a 
son’s income is strongly influenced 
by his father’s, indicating low social 
mobility. The result is a dramatic 
decline of the possibility of economic 
improvement for the poor.18 Poor 
children tend to remain poor and live 
2
* The FPL is determined by comparing a 
family’s pretax cash income to an income 
poverty threshold that is 3 times the cost of 
a minimum food diet. This measure does not 
take into account government benefi
 ts (eg, 
SNAP), income tax credits, or family expenses 
(eg, child care, income taxes) and has not 
fundamentally changed since 1969 except for 
annual adjustments for food price infl
 ation. In 
2010, the SPM was instituted to provide a more 
comprehensive measure of a family’s fi
 nancial 
circumstances. The SPM includes the value 
of certain federal in-kind benefi
 ts, federal tax 
benefi
 ts, and family expenses. For additional 
details on these measures, see the accompanying 
technical report, “Mediators and Adverse Effects 
of Child Poverty in the United States.”

in neighborhoods of low opportunity. 
Wealthy children continue to be 
wealthy as adults and enjoy academic 
and employment advantages.
The drag on social mobility resulting 
from income and opportunity 
inequality is even more striking for 
people of color. During the recovery 
of the Great Recession, income 
inequality in the United States 
accelerated, with 91% of the gains 
going to the top 1% of families.19 
Left out of the recovery were African 
American families who, during the 
downturn, lost an average of 35% of 
their accumulated wealth.20 African 
American unemployment increased, 
home ownership decreased, and child 
poverty deepened to approximately 
46% of children younger than 6 
years.21 Because social mobility 
is lowest for people in the lowest 
income quartile, half of African 
American children who are poor as 
young children will remain poor as 
adults, approximately twice as many 
as white adults similarly exposed to 
poverty as children.22
Although legacy residential 
segregation and environmental 
racism persist as regions of deep 
poverty in mostly urban areas, 
23 
the epidemiology of poverty has 
shifted over the past decade, in part 
because of the housing crisis and 
the Great Recession. Since 2008, 
suburbs have experienced larger 
and faster increases in poverty 
than either urban or rural areas.24 
This significant shift in the location 
and demographics of children and 
families dealing with financial stress 
makes necessary a reevaluation of 
the current engagement and service 
delivery systems that may not meet 
this emerging need.25
Because pediatricians work to 
prevent childhood diseases during 
health supervision visits and with 
anticipatory guidance, the early 
detection and management of 
poverty-related disorders is an 
important, emerging component 
of pediatric scope of practice. With 
improved understanding of the root 
causes and distal effects of poverty, 
pediatricians can apply interventions 
in practice to help address the toxic 
effects of poverty on children and 
families. They also can advocate for 
programs and policies to ameliorate 
early childhood adverse events 
related to poverty. Pediatricians 
have the opportunity to screen 
for risk factors for adversity, to 
identify family strengths that are 
protective against toxic stress, and 
to provide referrals to community 
organizations that support and 
assist families in economic stress. 
This policy statement builds on 
previous policies related to child 
health equity, 
26 housing insecurity,27 
and early childhood adversity.3 
The accompanying technical report 
from the American Academy of 
Pediatrics (AAP), “Mediators and 
Adverse Effects of Child Poverty in 
the United States, 
”28 supports this 
statement by describing current 
knowledge on childhood poverty and 
the mechanisms by which poverty 
influences the health and well-being 
of children.
WHAT WORKS TO AMELIORATE THE 
EFFECTS OF CHILD POVERTY
Programs that help poor families 
and children take many forms and 
often involve stakeholders from 
multiple communities, including 
governmental, private nonprofit, 
faith-based, business, and other 
philanthropic organizations. The 
following paragraphs describe 
several antipoverty and safety net 
programs that are particularly 
important for child health and 
well-being. These programs help 
families by increasing access to cash, 
providing “near-cash” benefits, and 
investing in child development.
Individual program outcomes, 
including financial cost-benefit 
estimates, are documented where 
possible. However, the cumulative 
effect of safety net programs 
has been demonstrably positive. 
Longitudinal studies from 1967 to 
2012 that used the Supplemental 
Poverty Measure (SPM) revealed that 
government programs have had a 
significant effect on family poverty. 
Without these programs, the rate of 
child poverty would have increased 
to 31% in 2012, 13 percentage points 
more than the actual SPM child 
poverty rate of 18%. Therefore, the 
income supports and direct benefits 
provided by these government 
programs have cut family poverty 
almost in half, from an estimated 
31% to approximately 16%.29
Tax Policies and Direct Financial Aid
The earned income tax credit (EITC) 
is a refundable federal tax credit that 
helps low-income families. The EITC 
helps reduce poverty by incentivizing 
employment and supplementing 
income for low-wage workers. In 
2012, 25 states had established 
their own state-level credits to 
supplement the federal credit.30 
The Center on Budget and Policy 
Priorities estimates that the federal 
EITC lifted 3.1 million children out 
of poverty in 2011.31 The EITC has 
been shown to increase workforce 
participation among single women 
with children and help families pay 
for basic essentials.32 Additional 
research also has connected the EITC 
to improvements in infant health. 
An analysis of families who received 
the largest EITC under the 1990s 
expansions of the credit showed 
lower rates of low birth weight 
children, fewer preterm births, and 
increased prenatal care among these 
families.33
The child tax credit provides tax 
refunds to low-income working 
families who pay payroll taxes 
but who might not owe federal 
income tax. Although only partially 
refundable, this direct cash benefit 
in 2012 helped approximately 1.6 
million children and their families 
maintain an income above the FPL.34

Taken together, the EITC and child 
tax credit represent tax policies that 
reduce childhood poverty and its 
effects.
Temporary Assistance for Needy 
Families (TANF) is a block grant 
program by which the federal 
government provides money 
for states to fund work and 
family support programs with 
specific goals and time limits. The 
Personal Responsibility and Work 
Reconciliation Act of 1996 (often 
referred to as welfare reform) 
created TANF to replace Aid to 
Families with Dependent Children, 
thereby creating block grants 
for state administration, work 
requirements for eligibility, and 
lifetime limits on receipt of federal 
support. Because of unchanging 
federal funding levels and limits 
of the amount of time individuals 
can access benefits, the number 
of families receiving TANF has 
decreased, despite the increased 
need since the Great Recession. 
National TANF caseloads, especially 
those receiving cash benefits, have 
declined by 50% since 1996, with 
state caseload reductions varying 
from 25% to 80% despite the steadily 
increasing numbers of families in 
poverty and deep poverty.35 The 
latitude that states have to designate 
how the funds are used adds to the 
limitation of TANF as a national 
safety net program.
Income stagnation in recent decades 
and the erosion of purchasing 
power have contributed to the 
financial instability of working poor 
families.36 Raising the minimum 
wage has been shown to help some 
low-income families reach 200% of 
the FPL and to be considered out of 
poverty.37 The benefit to children of 
improved family income stability is 
both general and specific. Financial 
stability means that basic needs, 
such as housing and transportation, 
are more dependable and family 
stress may be reduced. School 
readiness and academic performance 
of children are sensitive to family 
income. In a 1999 analysis by the 
Brookings Institute, statistically 
significant increases in math and 
reading performance were associated 
with only a $1000 increase in family 
annual income.38 A retrospective 
review of population data drawn 
from the Panel Study of Economic 
Dynamics and covering the years 
1968 to 2005 correlated the date 
of birth and family income during 
early childhood with eventual 
adult educational and economic 
attainment. The results suggest 
that an increase in annual family 
income of only $3000 during early 
childhood may result in significant 
improvements on both SAT scores 
and adult labor market success 
measured by an earnings increase 
of almost 20%. The association 
is strongest at the low end of the 
family income scale and becomes 
statistically nonsignificant for 
wealthy families.39
Work requirements for cash and 
other benefits have been advanced, 
especially since welfare reform in 
the 1990s, as a way to promote self-
sufficiency and reduce welfare rolls. 
However, as a consequence of young 
mothers being required to work, 
infants may be placed in child care at 
a very early age, and mothers often 
require a patchwork of solutions, 
some of which may be substandard.40 
Quality child care and early childhood 
education are extremely important 
for the promotion of cognitive and 
socioemotional development of 
infants and toddlers.41 Yet, child 
care may cost as much as housing 
in most areas of the United States, 
25% of the budget of a family with 
2 children, and infant care can cost 
as much as college.42 Many working 
families benefit from the dependent 
care tax credit for the cost of child 
care, allowing those families to place 
their children in a certified or higher-
quality environment.43 However, 
working families who do not have 
sufficient income to pay taxes are 
not able to realize this support for 
their children, because the credit is 
not refundable or paid to families 
before taxation.44 Therefore, some 
of the most at-risk children who 
might benefit from high-quality early 
childhood education are not eligible 
for financial support.
Access to Comprehensive Health 
Care
Children in poverty who otherwise 
would not have access to health care 
have greatly benefited from Medicaid 
and the Children’s Health Insurance 
Program (CHIP) and many provisions 
and protections of the Patient 
Protection and Affordable Care Act. 
From 1984 through 2013, the rate of 
uninsured poor children decreased 
by 70%, from approximately 29% 
to just over 8%. During the first 3 
months of 2014, the uninsured rate 
for poor children dropped further 
to 6.6%.45 As a measure of benefit 
from expanded coverage, children 
enrolled in Medicaid or CHIP are 
more likely to access preventive 
care than are uninsured children.46, 
47 
In addition, CHIP has resulted in a 
9.8% increase in the coverage of 
children with chronic illness and a 
6.4% decrease in uninsured children 
in the general population.48 In 2009, 
CHIP programs expanded access 
to comprehensive care by covering 
dental, mental health, and substance 
abuse services in addition to medical 
and surgical care for all eligible near-
poor children.49
Early Childhood Education
Early Head Start and Head Start are 
federally funded, community-based 
programs for low-income families 
with young children. Early Head 
Start serves pregnant women and 
families with infants and toddlers 
up to 3 years of age; Head Start 
serves families with preschool-
aged children 3 to 5 years of age. 
In fiscal year 2011, the programs 
served more than 900 000 children 
nationally, with a budget of $7

billion. These programs provide 
educational, nutritional, health, and 
social services. In addition to child 
care and preschool services, Early 
Head Start and Head Start offer 
prenatal education, job-training and 
adult education, and assistance in 
accessing housing and insurance.50 
However, Early Head Start presently 
serves only approximately 3% of 
low-income families.51 The Child Care 
Development Block Grants Act of 
2014 and subsequent appropriations 
also provide child care subsidies for 
low-income working families and 
funds to improve child care quality, 
in addition to new and needed 
protections to keep children safe and 
healthy when they are being cared 
for outside the home.52
Early childhood interventions 
have been found to have a high 
rate of return in both human and 
financial terms. Early interventions 
in high-risk situations have the 
highest return, presumably through 
mitigating the effects of toxic stress 
by providing nurturance, stimulation, 
and nutrition. Child benefits include 
improved cognitive functioning, 
improved self-regulation, and 
advancement of development in all 
domains. Research as early as 2005 
by the Rand Corporation found a 
range of return on investment from 
$1.80 to $17 for each dollar spent on 
early childhood interventions.53 More 
recent studies of preschool (birth 
to age 5 years) education estimate a 
return on investment as high as 14% 
per year on the basis of improved 
academic and occupation outcomes, 
in addition to lowered costs of 
remedial education and juvenile 
justice involvement.54
Nutrition Support
The Supplemental Nutrition Program 
for Women, Infants, and Children 
(WIC) is a federal assistance program 
of the US Department of Agriculture 
that was first established in 1974 
with the aim of improving the health 
of low-income women, infants, and 
children. WIC provides nutrition 
education, growth monitoring, and 
breastfeeding promotion and 
support in addition to food for 
pregnant and postpartum women, 
infants, and children younger than 
5 years with incomes less than 185% 
of the FPL.55
WIC is associated with improved 
outcomes in pregnancy and early 
childhood development. A series 
of reports from the US Department 
of Agriculture has shown that WIC 
participation for low-income women 
decreased the rates of prematurity 
and infant mortality and increased 
involvement in prenatal care.56 The 
promotion of breastfeeding has 
resulted in significant improvements 
in the rate and duration of 
exclusive breastfeeding among 
WIC participants.57 Studies of the 
postinfancy period also have shown 
that WIC increases the quality of 
children’s diets, with increases in 
micronutrient intake and resulting 
decreases in iron-deficiency anemia. 
Children participating in WIC have 
scored higher on assessments of 
mental development at 2 years of 
age than similar children who were 
not participating in the program. In 
addition, children whose mothers 
participated in WIC when they 
were in utero have also been shown 
to perform better on reading 
assessments than similar children 
of mothers who did not use the 
program.58
SNAP, formerly referred to as 
“food stamps, 
” uses an electronic 
benefits card to provide nutrition 
assistance to low-income individuals 
and families. As with other federal 
programs, eligibility depends 
on income, age, family size, and 
citizenship. More than 45 million 
Americans currently receive SNAP 
benefits each month, including 
approximately 20 million children.59 
Using the SPM, SNAP benefits reduce 
both the rate (decrease of 4.4% 
attributable to SNAP from 2000 to 
2009) and, more importantly, the 
depth of poverty for children in the 
poorest of poor families.60
The National School Lunch Program 
is a federally funded program 
that provides low-cost and free 
breakfasts, lunches, and, on a limited 
basis, summer food to school-aged 
children. The federal program 
supplies both public and private 
nonprofit schools with food and cash 
incentives. The meals are produced 
in accordance with the Dietary 
Guidelines for Americans. In 2012, 
31.6 million children each day were 
served low-cost and free lunches at a 
total cost of $11.6 billion.61 Students 
from families with an income less 
than 130% of the FPL are eligible 
to receive free meals, and those 
from families with an income less 
than 185% of the FPL are eligible 
for reduced-price meals. A recent 
analysis estimated that, using these 
guidelines, more than half of all US 
public school students are eligible to 
receive free or reduced-price meals.62
Nutrition support, such as WIC and 
SNAP, address undernutrition, but 
other forms of malnutrition, such 
as obesity, also may be responsive 
to supplemental programs. For 
instance, a recent study in preschool-
aged children found that those who 
participated in Head Start had a 
healthier BMI at school entry than 
did children who did not have the 
benefit of food provided by federal 
subsidy.63
Home Visiting
The Maternal, Infant, and Early 
Child Home Visiting (MIECHV) 
Program was established as part 
of the Affordable Care Act in 2010. 
It provides support for federal, 
state, and community governments 
to implement established and 
proven home visiting programs for 
at-risk children. The stated goals of 
MIECHV are to improve maternal 
and newborn health; prevent 
child injuries, abuse, neglect, or 
maltreatment; reduce emergency 
department visits; improve school

readiness and achievement; reduce 
crime or domestic violence; improve 
family economic self-sufficiency; and 
improve coordination and referrals 
for other community resources and 
supports.64
MIECHV has identified 19 evidence-
based interventions that target 
families with pregnant mothers and 
children younger than 5 years.65, 
66 
One example of an MIECHV program 
with evidence of success is the 
Nurse-Family Partnership. First-time, 
low-income mothers are enrolled 
during the prenatal period and 
visited weekly by nurses trained in a 
validated curriculum beginning in the 
second trimester. The benefit-cost 
ratio for high-risk mothers has been 
calculated at 5.68 to 1.67
Family and Parenting Support in the 
Medical Home
Programs designed for the pediatric 
medical home provide opportunities 
for low-cost, population-based 
preventive intervention with low-
income families. An awareness 
of the protective factors that are 
present in children and families can 
help pediatricians to build on their 
strengths during health promotion 
conversations. A commonly used 
instrument to assess protective 
factors in high-risk families is 
available through the FRIENDS 
National Resource Center.68 The 
Protective Factor Survey is used 
to assess current status as well as 
change over time in family resiliency, 
social connectedness, quality of 
attachment, and knowledge of child 
development.
In a medical home adapted to the 
needs of families in poverty, parents 
have the opportunities and resources 
to promote resilience in their young 
children, giving them the capacity 
to adapt to adversity and buffering 
the effects of stress. Healthy Steps 
for Young Children, a manual-based 
primary care strategy, and programs 
such as Incredible Years and Triple 
P, which integrate behavioral health 
into primary care, have been shown 
to promote responsive parenting 
and address common behavioral and 
developmental concerns.69–73 Early 
literacy promotion in the medical 
home with programs such as Reach 
Out and Read advances reading 
readiness by approximately 6 months 
when compared with controls.74 In 
addition, parents in Reach Out and 
Read practices are 4 times as likely to 
read to their children and more likely 
to spend time with their children in 
interactive play75 than are families 
who are not in Reach Out and 
Read. Another program, the Video 
Interaction Project (VIP), combines 
early literacy with guided parent-
child interactions that support family 
relationships and social development 
of children.70
The AAP has promoted the 
National Center for Medical-Legal 
Partnerships model, which provides 
legal aid collocated with health 
services, especially to families in 
poverty. A pilot study of medical-
legal partnerships found that 
addressing the social determinants 
of health by providing legal 
services and helping families 
negotiate safety net organizations 
improves child health outcomes, 
reduces unnecessary urgent 
visits, and raises overall child 
well-being.76
Care coordination, a fundamental 
service of the medical home model, 
can link families with community 
resources and support interagency 
coordination to address basic 
concerns such as food and energy 
insecurity. An example of a robust 
case management initiative is 
Health Leads, 
77 an enhanced 
primary care strategy that uses 
college volunteers as advocates and 
advanced resource management 
techniques, which has improved 
coordination of care and utilization 
of collocated social services by low-
income families with the intent of 
reducing the social barriers to good 
health.
Early Identifi
 cation of Families in 
Need of Services
To link families to services as 
early as possible, pediatricians 
can use screening tools that have 
high sensitivity and specificity. 
The WE CARE survey78 is a brief 
set of questions that alerts the 
pediatrician to families experiencing 
stress related to poverty. In the 
policy statement “Promoting Food 
Security for All Children, 
” the AAP 
recommends the use of a 2-question 
survey that has a high sensitivity to 
detect food insecurity.79, 
80 A single 
question, “Do you have difficulty 
making ends meet at the end of 
the month?” may be enough to 
alert the pediatrician with 98% 
sensitivity to a need for linking 
families to community resources.81 
Inquiring whether families have 
moved frequently in the past year or 
have lived with another family for 
financial reasons will reveal housing 
insecurity.82
Effective early identification of 
families in need may facilitate 
prevention services, including 
nutritional supplements for 
young children, preventive health 
services, age-appropriate learning 
opportunities, and socioemotional 
support of parents. Program 
evaluation has supported this 
multifaceted approach in multiple 
countries and settings.83 Analyses 
by Nobel Prize–winning economist 
James Heckman reveal that early 
prevention activities targeted toward 
disadvantaged children have high 
rates of economic returns, much 
higher than remediation efforts 
later in childhood or adult life.84 
For example, the Perry Preschool 
Program showed an average 
rate of return of $8.74 for every 
dollar invested in early childhood 
education.85 Targeted interventions 
foster protective factors, including 
responsive, nurturing, cognitively 
stimulating, consistent, and stable 
parenting by either birth parents 
or other consistent adults. Early

childhood experiences that promote 
relational health lead to secure 
attachment, effective self-regulation 
and sleep, normal development of 
the neuroendocrine system, healthy 
stress-response systems, and positive 
changes in the architecture of the 
developing brain.86, 
87 Perhaps the 
most important protective factors are 
those that attenuate the toxic stress 
effects of childhood poverty on early 
brain and child development.3, 
5, 
88
Interventions for Adolescents and 
Parents of Young Children
In recent years, there has been a 
growing focus on “2-generation” 
strategies to reduce poverty and 
improve outcomes for low-income 
families. Two-generation strategies 
focus on helping low-income children 
and their parents simultaneously 
through high-quality interventions.89 
For example, a 2-generation program 
may enroll parents into job training 
at the same time as children are 
enrolled into quality child care. This 
type of approach aims to improve a 
family’s earning potential as well as 
the child’s developmental outcomes. 
Improved coordination of programs 
and services for low-income families 
is essential to a 2-generation 
strategy.
Recent research suggests that 
noncognitive skills, such as 
perseverance, empathy, and self-
efficacy, remain malleable during 
adolescence90 and build on the 
cognitive skills developed during 
early childhood. Interventions 
such as adolescent mentoring, 
residential training (eg, Job Corps), 
and workplace-based apprenticeship 
programs can increase academic 
achievement, employment 
success, and other nonacademic 
accomplishments over the life span.90
RECOMMENDATIONS
As the health care system 
increasingly focuses on efforts to 
improve quality and contain costs, 
there may be new opportunities to 
restructure the health care delivery 
system in ways that can improve care 
for children in low-income families. 
Policy decisions in other countries, 
such as the United Kingdom, 
91 
also may inform these efforts. 
Incentivizing care coordination and 
team-based care may help more 
children access quality health care 
through patient- and family-centered 
medical homes (FCMHs). Medical 
homes also can help families address 
unmet social and economic needs by 
using partners, such as community 
health workers, within the health 
care team.92, 
93 As previously noted, 
home visiting is supported through 
the MIECHV.
State reforms and integrated 
health delivery systems in some 
regions are providing incentives 
for population health approaches, 
facilitating collaboration in 
healthy neighborhood initiatives.94 
Collaborators with health care 
organizations may include education 
systems, social services, faith-
based groups, and community 
development organizations. Although 
all children may benefit from greater 
collaboration between health care 
organizations and community 
resources, children in poor and low-
income families may experience even 
greater gains.
Opportunities for Public Policy 
Advocacy
Public policy efforts are needed to 
protect the health of children affected 
by poverty and to help families 
become economically secure. The 
specific recommendations made in 
this and the following section are 
based on positive outcomes in peer-
reviewed literature or preliminary 
studies that show sufficient promise 
that rigorous long-term evaluations 
are underway.
 
• Invest in young children. Funding 
quality early childhood programs 
can have a significant financial 
return on investment, but more 
importantly, making healthy 
development of young children a 
national priority while addressing 
social determinants of health helps 
families and communities build a 
foundation for lifelong health.
 
• Protect and expand funding 
for essential benefits programs 
that assist low-income and poor 
children. Invest in children’s health 
and development by appropriately 
funding evidence-based programs, 
including Early Head Start and 
Head Start, Medicaid, CHIP, WIC, 
home visiting, SNAP, school meal 
programs and other programs 
that increase access to healthy 
food, and Child Care Development 
Block Grant–funded programs. 
Streamline enrollment and renewal 
processes for public benefit 
programs.95
 
• Support 2-generation strategies 
that focus on helping children and 
parents simultaneously. Promote 
the coordination and alignment of 
adult- and child-focused programs, 
policies, and systems.
 
• Support and expand strategies 
that promote employment and 
that increase parental income. 
Programs that increase low-income 
parents’ earnings have been 
shown to improve child outcomes. 
Support policies that help parents 
increase family income, including 
higher minimum wages, education 
and job-training programs, and the 
EITC, child tax credit, and child and 
dependent care tax credit.
 
• Support policy measures that 
improve community infrastructure, 
including affordable housing and 
public spaces. Ensure that all 
children have safe outdoor play 
areas as well as healthy, safe, and 
affordable housing.
 
• Improve access to quality health 
care and create incentives to 
improve population health 
with the goal of reducing health 
disparities. Strategies to improve 
quality and reduce costs should 
7

 FROM THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS
include care coordination and 
team-based care that help families 
address nonmedical health-related 
concerns, such as food, housing, 
and utilities. Pediatricians and 
health care systems should be 
encouraged to partner with 
other stakeholders to advance 
community-level strategies 
that improve health and reduce 
disparities among populations of 
varying income levels.
 
• Enhance health care financing 
to support comprehensive care 
for at-risk families. All benefit 
plans should include coverage for 
enhanced services in the medical 
home for families in poverty. Care 
coordination, team-delivered care, 
and coverage for mental health 
services provided by pediatricians 
are examples of these enhanced 
services.
 
• Make a national commitment to 
fully fund home visiting programs 
for all children living in low-income 
or poor households. The Bureau 
of Maternal and Child Health has 
identified 19 programs, including 
but not limited to Nurse-Family 
Partnership, Early Head Start, 
Healthy Families America, and 
Parents as Teachers, that target 
families with pregnant women or 
children younger than 5 years.
 
• Support integrated models of 
care in the medical home that 
promote effective parenting and 
school readiness, such as Healthy 
Steps, Reach Out and Read, 
VIP, Incredible Years, Medical 
Legal Partnerships, and Positive 
Parenting Program. Both Medicaid 
and education funding agencies 
should provide support in the 
medical home for parenting and 
literacy promotion.
 
• Improve national poverty 
definitions and measures. The 
FPL underestimates the extent 
and depth of poverty in the 
United States. The SPM is an 
improvement, but more research 
is necessary to quantify the extent 
of poverty in the United States and 
its effects on children and families 
so that effective responses can be 
developed and promoted.
 
• Support a comprehensive 
research agenda to improve the 
understanding of the effects 
of poverty on children and to 
identify and refine interventions 
that improve child health 
outcomes. Research is needed to 
identify better ways to measure 
how poverty affects children, 
what works to help families in 
poverty, and how to translate 
the information gained into real 
solutions for the poor.
Opportunities for Community 
Practice
The following recommendations 
address how individual pediatricians 
can support the health and well-
being of children living in poverty. 
Adaptations of the medical home to 
acknowledge the complex challenges 
that confront poor families require 
surveillance on the part of the 
practitioner of both risk and 
protective factors that characterize 
each family.
 
• Create a medical home that 
acknowledges and is sensitive 
to the needs of families living 
in poverty. Although every 
family wants to provide the 
best resources and care to their 
children, economic barriers can 
stand in the way. All members of 
the care team and practice should 
become familiar with some of the 
common challenges faced by poor 
families. Recognizing problems 
such as transportation barriers, 
difficult work schedules, and 
competing financial issues can help 
practices effectively communicate 
and partner with families. An 
enhanced medical home providing 
integrated care for families 
in poverty is informed by the 
understanding that emotional care 
of the family, including recognizing 
maternal depression, is within the 
scope of practice for community 
pediatricians and that the effects 
of toxic stress on children can be 
ameliorated by supportive, secure 
relational health during early 
childhood.
 
• Screen for risk factors within social 
determinants of health during 
patient encounters. Practices 
can use a brief written screener 
or verbally ask family members 
questions about basic needs, 
such as food, housing, and heat. 
Screening for basic needs can help 
uncover not only obvious but also 
less apparent economic difficulties 
experienced by families. As patient-
centered medical homes continue 
to develop, care coordinators will 
fulfill the role of community liaison 
for families in poverty, connecting 
them with needed resources.
 
• Consider implementing integrated 
medical home programs, such as 
Healthy Steps, Reach Out and Read, 
Health Leads, and VIP, in addition 
to primary care integration with 
mental health interventions 
such as Incredible Years and 
Triple P. These programs help 
parents develop the capacity and 
confidence to build resilience 
in their children and improve 
the ability of the family to cope 
with adversity. Bright Futures 
guidelines provide the most 
comprehensive recommendations 
for health supervision and are 
enhanced by strategies to advance 
behavioral health care into the 
pediatric medical home and to 
address the social determinants of 
health.
 
• Identify and build on family 
strengths and protective factors. 
Although families in poverty face 
many challenges, each family 
has strengths, capabilities, and 
protective factors. Pediatricians 
can strive to identify and build on 
protective factors within families, 
such as cohesion, humor, support 
networks, skills, and spiritual and

cultural beliefs.96, 
97 By approaching 
families from a strengths-based 
perspective, pediatricians can help 
build trust and identify the assets 
on which a family can draw to 
effectively address problems and 
care for their children.
 
• Collaborate with community 
organizations to help families 
address unmet basic needs and 
assist with family stressors. When 
unmet basic needs and poverty-
associated risks are identified, 
pediatricians can refer families to 
appropriate community services 
and public programs. Key partners 
may include local and state public 
health departments, legal services, 
social work organizations, food 
pantries, faith-based organizations, 
and community development 
organizations. Some communities 
also may have innovative financial 
literacy programs that are 
helpful.98 Practices may partner 
with local home visiting programs, 
community mental health services, 
and parent support groups that can 
help families address parenting 
challenges and other stressors.
 
• Engage with early intervention 
programs and schools to 
promote learning and academic 
achievement. Education 
professionals are often very 
involved in efforts to help children 
from low-income backgrounds 
with academic achievement and 
also may participate in initiatives 
focused on basic needs, such 
as feeding programs, clothing 
drives, and health screenings. 
Pediatricians can actively 
participate with these efforts 
as well as early intervention 
programs, after-school programs, 
tutoring programs, and social 
services provided through the 
school district.
 
• Promote the MIECHV program. 
Pediatricians should be familiar 
with local MIECHV programs and 
how to connect their patients with 
home visiting programs on the 
state and local levels. Pediatricians 
and the AAP should be aware 
that the MIECHV continually 
reviews home visiting programs 
for inclusion in the MIECHV and 
can submit programs for review 
that they have found successful. 
Opportunities for enhanced 
communication between the 
FCMH and home-visiting programs 
may be explored, including the 
possibility of collocation of visitors 
in the FCMH as an integrated 
service model.
 
• Support community programs that 
enhance the involvement of fathers 
in the lives of their children. 
Pediatricians can be an important 
support resource and advocate 
for community-based fatherhood 
initiatives. When possible, 
nonresidential fathers should be 
involved in all aspects of pediatric 
care.
 
• Advance strategies to address 
family and child mental health 
and development. Pediatricians 
are strongly encouraged to 
include routine screening for 
maternal depression at every 
health supervision visit during the 
first year of life and to be able to 
provide an appropriate referral 
for treatment when depression 
is suspected. Pediatricians 
can advocate for increased 
resources to address mental 
health and behavioral issues in 
poor communities, including 
separate payment for screening for 
parental depression and for care 
coordination activities.
 
• Advocate for public policies that 
support all children and help 
mitigate the effects of poverty 
on child health. Pediatricians can 
serve as important advocates for 
policies that help children and 
families in poverty. Pediatricians 
can add a unique voice to poverty-
related advocacy by reframing 
poverty as an evidence-based 
health concern with lifelong health, 
social, and economic consequences.
CONCLUSIONS
Poverty and other adverse social 
determinants have a detrimental 
effect on child health and are root 
causes of child health inequity 
in the United States. Knowledge 
is expanding rapidly, especially 
regarding the neurobiological effects 
of poverty and related environmental 
stressors on the developing human 
brain as well as the life course of 
chronic illness. Understanding 
the causative relation between 
early childhood poverty and adult 
health status should inform and 
influence the decisions of policy 
makers, researchers, and community 
pediatricians. The evidence strongly 
suggests that the FCMH with its 
enhanced capabilities is an essential 
asset in efforts to ameliorate the 
adverse effects of poverty on 
children.
The AAP considers child poverty in 
the United States unacceptable and 
detrimental to the health and well-
being of children and is committed 
to its elimination. The AAP calls for 
concerted action by its state 
chapters as well as governmental, 
private, nonprofit, faith-based, 
philanthropic, and other advocacy 
organizations to reduce child poverty 
by supporting and expanding 
existing programs that have 
been shown to work and to make 
efforts to develop, identify, and 
promote other potentially effective 
policies and programs. In 1935, 
the US Congress passed the Social 
Security Act and in 1965 enacted 
Medicare. Together, these 2 pieces 
of legislation have greatly reduced 
and nearly eliminated poverty in the 
elderly. It is time to enact similar 
reforms to eliminate child poverty. 
By embracing the policies and 
enacting the recommendations in 
this statement, the AAP joins with 
governmental, philanthropic, private, 
and other health care organizations 
in a concerted and dedicated effort to 
eliminate child poverty in the United 
States.
