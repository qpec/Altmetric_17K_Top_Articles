Observational evidence suggests that a relationship may exist between high glycemic index diets and the development of anxiety
and depression symptoms; however, as no interventional studies assessing this relationship in a psychiatric population have been
completed, the possibility of a causal link is unclear. AB is a 15-year-old female who presented with concerns of generalized anxiety
disorder and hypoglycemia symptoms. Her diet consisted primarily of refined carbohydrates. The addition of protein, fat, and
fiber to her diet resulted in a substantial decrease in anxiety symptoms as well as a decrease in the frequency and severity of
hypoglycemia symptoms. A brief return to her previous diet caused a return of her anxiety symptoms, followed by improvement
when she restarted the prescribed diet. This case strengthens the hypothesis that dietary glycemic index may play a role in the
pathogenesis or progression of mental illnesses such as generalized anxiety disorder and subsequently that dietary modification as
a therapeutic intervention in the treatment of mental illness warrants further study.
1. Introduction
Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a common and often
disabling disease. It is characterized by fear, tension, and
excessive worries regarding common events or problems
for a minimum of six months [1] and is accompanied by
physical symptoms such as heart palpitations, muscle tension,
and chest tightness. Patients may experience nonspecific
symptoms such as irritability and difficulty concentrating in
addition to deterioration in the quality of their social, work,
and personal experiences [1, 2]. Traumatic life experiences,
dysfunctional serotonin, and epinephrine neurotransmitter
systems and pernicious genetic influences are potentially
involved in the development of GAD [3]. It is estimated that
the lifetime prevalence is between 4.3% and 5.9% [1, 3] and
40–67% of patients experience comorbid depression [3].
Conventional treatment of anxiety involves cognitive
behavioural therapy in combination with pharmacologic
interventions such as serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake
inhibitors (SNRI), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors
(SSRI), or benzodiazepines [2, 3]. Despite appropriate treat-
ment, many GAD patients cannot successfully achieve short
term or long term remission. After five years, remission
rates may remain as low as 38% [2]. Thus, the need for
nonpharmacological approaches is evident [4].
Several studies suggest a relationship between improved
nutrition and better mental health outcomes, both in general
and adolescent populations. Epidemiological studies, includ-
ing a recent meta-analysis, have shown that a diet including
fruits, vegetables, fish, olive oil, nuts, and legumes may reduce
the chance of developing depression [4, 5]. A prospective
study found that a Mediterranean dietary pattern at baseline
reduced the risk of depressive episodes 16.5 years later [6].
Despite evidence correlating a healthy diet with the
maintenance of mental health, a trend towards a reduction in
the quality of adolescent diets has been observed at the global
level. This trend is characterized by an increased intake of fast
foods, fried foods, sweets, refined grains, processed meat, and
a reduction of fruit/vegetable intake [7]. The consumption
of this Western-style diet has been independently associated
with a greater risk for the development of anxiety and
depression [7] and associated with a decline in the mental
health status of adolescents [6]. Another study found an
increased likelihood of psychological problems in adolescents
associated with diets high in unhealthy foods [7].

Case Reports in Psychiatry
A number of possible mechanisms have been proposed
for the effect of diet on mental health including a role of
inflammation and oxidation [6], deficiency of micronutrients
such as folate, zinc, and magnesium [7], and glycemic
balance.
The increase in global consumption of refined foods such
as sweetened beverages, pastries, and refined carbohydrates
impacts dietary glycemic index (GI), a measurement of the
rate of blood glucose generation from specific food items.
Glycemic load (GL) reflects both the glycemic index value
and the total carbohydrate content of the food. Foods with
a higher GI or GL create greater increases in blood sugar [8].
A recent cohort study showed that increasing odds
of depression and anxiety have been associated with the
consumption of foods that have a progressively higher GI and
this relationship is maintained after controlling for micronu-
trients known to play a role in mental health [8]. Cross-
sectional studies have demonstrated a correlation between
the occurrence of depression/stress and higher intake of sweet
foods [9] and a large prospective cohort study showed a
positive correlation between a diet high in sweet desserts and
refined grains and the risk for depression. Conversely, it was
found that high consumption of fruits and vegetables, which
contain fiber that lowers GI, was associated with a lower risk
for depression [9].
In addition to the observational studies, a limited number
of interventional studies have explored a potential relation-
ship between blood sugar balance and emotional and cog-
nitive health. One clinical trial assigned healthy overweight
subjects to high or low GI diets and found that the high
GI diet resulted in worsening mood scores [10]. Two studies
assessed the impact of high and low GI meals on cognitive
performance in adults with type 2 diabetes and children,
respectively, and found that the higher GI meal was related
to poorer cognitive function [11, 12]. Conversely, two other
intervention studies comparing high and low GI diets in
patients with diabetes did not find a change in subclinical
depression or cognitive function [9]. Despite this evidence
that a relationship between dietary GI and emotional and
cognitive functioning may exist, no interventional studies
have assessed the impact of a low GI or low GL dietary
intervention in psychiatric patient populations in order to
assess causality of the relationship.
2. Case Presentation
AB is a 15-year-old female student of south-Asian descent.
She presented with concerns of anxiety and symptoms of
hypoglycemia as well as difficulty concentrating, fatigue,
headaches, asthma, and frequent urinary and vaginal infec-
tions.
Her anxiety met criteria for GAD and she rated the
intensity of anxiety as 8/10, with 10 being the highest level of
anxiety possible. The anxiety started three months prior to the
initial appointment and had worsened in the previous month.
She described excessive worry that was difficult to control and
impacted her daily functioning by causing her to be absent
from school on several occasions. She experienced a number
of somatic symptoms including heart palpitations, shakiness,
discomfort in her stomach, and muscle tension. In response
to the anxiety symptoms, she would eat foods like chocolate,
chips, or fruit. AB was working with a counsellor to manage
the anxiety symptoms and was finding some benefit.
AB had experienced episodes suggestive of hypoglycemia
since 12 years of age. The symptoms included muscle weak-
ness and shaking, headaches, nausea, anxiety, and loss of
concentration. Her symptoms were ameliorated by eating
sweet foods. AB reported that her hypoglycemia was at its
worst at 12 years of age when she had to eat a granola bar
hourly in order to concentrate.
2.1. Clinical Findings. A diet history revealed the following
typical daily food intake:
(i) Breakfast: fruit smoothie containing fruit, fruit juice,
and water.
(ii) Morning snack: bagel with margarine.
(iii) Lunch: pasta or white rice with vegetables.
(iv) Afternoon snack: granola bar or cookies or gummy
candies.
(v) After school meal: white pasta; it may include meat.
(vi) Dinner: white rice or spaghetti; it may include meat.
(vii) Evening snack: cookies and toast.
(viii) Beverages: 2 liters of water, 1 cup of juice, 1 cup of
lactose-free milk, and 1 cup of tea.
2.2. Past Medical History. Due to her difficulty concentrating,
AB was prescribed dextroamphetamine 5 mg. While she
found that it improved concentration, this medication caused
her to lose weight. As the patient’s weight was initially on the
lower end of normal (weight: 115 lb., height: 5󸀠6󸀠󸀠, and BMI:
18.6) the dose was reduced to 2 to 3 times per week, as needed.
2.3. Psychosocial History. AB lives with her mother, father,
and sister. AB’s sister experienced mental health concerns in
the previous years which created elevated stress levels in the
family home.
2.4. Diagnostic Focus and Assessment. Repeated assessments
of random and fasting blood glucose and screening physical
examination were within normal range.
2.5. Therapeutic Approach. At the initial visit, the following
dietary plan was prescribed:
(i) Breakfast: it includes a smoothie containing fruit,
water, 1 scoop of protein powder, and 1 tablespoon of
flax seeds or olive oil.
(ii) Lunch and dinner: they include a serving of protein
(meat, legume, and soy) and a serving of vegetables.
(iii) Snacks: they include protein when possible (e.g.,
apple with sunflower seed butter, vegetable sticks with
hummus, and pumpkin seeds).

(iv) Continue to eat carbohydrate-containing snacks as
needed for the management of hypoglycemia symp-
toms.
She was asked to follow these dietary guidelines daily until
the follow-up visit. While eggs, nuts, and fish would have
normally been recommended as well, the patient had an
anaphylactic allergy to these foods.
2.6. Follow-Up and Outcomes. At the first follow-up, four
weeks later, AB reported that she had complied with the
dietary plan since the previous visit. She reported a significant
decrease in anxiety (4 to 5/10), as well as improved energy,
less-frequent and less intense hypoglycemia symptoms, and
fewer headaches (once per week compared to daily) in
addition to improved concentration and mood. She required
fewer snacks during the day and decreased her intake of
granola bars, cookies, and candies (1-2 servings per day). She
also reported a cessation of chronic vaginal discharge. The
substantial improvement in her anxiety symptoms prompted
AB to temporarily discontinue her counselling sessions.
At a subsequent follow-up visit four weeks later, AB
reported that she had briefly reverted back to her original
diet for a period of one week and experienced a worsening
of anxiety symptoms within one day. After returning to
the dietary intervention prescribed, her anxiety symptoms
decreased within two days.
3. Discussion
This case illustrates an example of improved anxiety and
hypoglycemia symptoms in response to changes in the
macronutrient composition of the diet. It suggests that
dietary GI and blood sugar balance, within a physiologic
range, may play a role in the development or clinical progres-
sion of anxiety. Subsequently, modifying the diet by reducing
the consumption of refined carbohydrates and including
more protein, fat, and fiber may be beneficial.
The proposed relationship is supported by observational
studies demonstrating a relationship between higher GI/GL
and increased incidence of mental illness as well as a
potential mechanism. High GI foods result in an increase in
blood glucose levels; however, a large compensatory insulin
release may result in reactive hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia is
associated with an acute increase in epinephrine [13] which
contributes to neuropsychiatric symptoms including anxiety
[14] and symptoms associated with anxiety such as shakiness,
sweating, and heart palpitations. Induction of hypoglycemia
in a laboratory setting has a negative impact on mood,
hedonic tone, and energy levels as well as an increase in tense
arousal [15]. The presence of both anxiety and hypoglycemia
symptoms in AB’s case, along with their concurrent response
to treatment, lends support to the hypothesis that these
conditions may be related.
However, it is unclear if other macronutrient or micronu-
trient changes were, at least in part, responsible for the
patient’s symptom improvement as she had made several
changes concurrently. A recent study found that the individu-
als in the highest third of GI had lower intake of magnesium,
vitamin B6, vitamin B12, omega-3 fatty acids, and protein.
Evidence shows that all of these nutrients may play a role in
the prevention of mental illness [9].
Evidence suggests that adequate intake of protein may
be required in the maintenance of mental health. Dietary
protein provides amino acids, eight of which are essential.
They cannot be synthesized by the body and must be
supplied through the diet. Amino acids form the building
blocks of neurotransmitters. For example, the synthesis of
serotonin requires the essential amino acid tryptophan and
dopamine synthesis requires tyrosine, which is produced
from the essential amino acid phenylalanine. The lack of
tyrosine and tryptophan leads to deficiencies of the respective
neurotransmitters and has been associated with psychiatric
disturbances [16].
Micronutrient factors are also involved in neurotrans-
mitter synthesis and may be involved in the development of
mood and anxiety disorders. As in this case, a diet low in meat
may be low in vitamin B12 and a diet low in green vegetables
may lack folate. Because both nutrients are important for
neurotransmitter synthesis [17], dietary intake may play a
role in the development or progression of mood and anxiety
disorders.
Dietary fat may also play a role in mental health. The
dry weight of the brain is 60 percent fat [18] and low levels
of omega-3 fats and cholesterol are significant risk factors
for major depression and suicide [19]. Omega-3 fats, which
cannot be produced endogenously and must be obtained
from the diet, affect the serotonergic system [19] and an
inverse relationship between dietary omega-3 fatty acids and
anxiety disorders has been demonstrated [7]. Preliminary
evidence suggests that omega-3 supplementation may be
beneficial in the treatment of anxiety [20].
Despite these other potential factors, the concomitant
improvement in both anxiety and hypoglycemia symptoms
suggests that blood sugar balance may have been contributing
to AB’s anxiety disorder and that improvement in blood sugar
management, as seen in the reduction of hypoglycaemic
symptoms, may have been a significant factor in the response
to treatment. In conjunction with the observational data [13],
this may strengthen our understanding of the relationship
between suboptimal blood sugar regulation, GI/GL, and
mental illness.
One strength of this case report is that the dietary
modifications were the only intervention initiated at the time
during which the improvement in symptoms was observed.
As well, the brief return to the patient’s previous diet and
subsequent worsening of symptoms lends support to the
likelihood of a causal relationship.
Some limitations exist as well. No validated assessment
tool was used to monitor change in anxiety symptoms, only
the patient’s subjective report. Additionally, the patient was
receiving counselling concurrently.
Blood sugar balance and dietary GI/GL appear to be
important factors in a number of chronic illnesses. A recent
meta-analysis found significant positive associations between
higher GI or GL and higher incidence of diabetes, coronary
heart disease, gallbladder disease, breast cancer, and all
diseases combined [21]. As such, implementing a diet lower

in refined carbohydrates in the treatment of anxiety may have
substantial additional benefit with respect to risk of chronic
disease.
4. Conclusion
Dietary carbohydrates may be significantly related to emo-
tional and cognitive symptoms such as anxiety and difficulty
concentrating. Further research into the potential role of
GI in the pathogenesis and progression of mental health
concerns in addition to the utility of dietary interventions in
the treatment of these conditions is warranted.
