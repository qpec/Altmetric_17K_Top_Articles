Abstract
Background
Probiotics have generated intensive research interest in recent years as a novel mode of
treatment for physical and mental illness. Nevertheless, the anxiolytic potential of probiotics
remains unclear. The present systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the
clinical and preclinical (animal model) evidence regarding the effect of probiotic administra-
tion on anxiety.
Methods
The PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of Science databases were reviewed for preclinical and
clinical studies that met the defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. The effects of probiotics
on anxiety-like behavior and symptoms of anxiety were analyzed by meta-analyses. Sepa-
rate subgroup analyses were conducted on diseased versus healthy animals, specific pre-
clinical probiotic species, and clinical versus healthy human samples.
Results
Data were extracted from 22 preclinical studies (743 animals) and 14 clinical studies (1527
individuals). Overall, probiotics reduced anxiety-like behavior in animals (Hedges’ g = -0.47,
95% CI -0.77 –-0.16, p = 0.004). Subgroup analyses revealed a significant reduction only
among diseased animals. Probiotic species-level analyses identified only Lactobacillus (L.)
rhamnosus as an anxiolytic species, but these analyses were broadly under-powered. Pro-
biotics did not significantly reduce symptoms of anxiety in humans (Hedges’ g = -0.12, 95%
CI -0.29–0.05, p = 0.151), and did not differentially affect clinical and healthy human
samples.
Conclusions
While preclinical (animal) studies suggest that probiotics may help reduce anxiety, such
findings have not yet translated to clinical research in humans, perhaps due to the dearth of
extant research with clinically anxious populations. Further investigation of probiotic

Introduction
Anxiety disorders are a class of psychological disturbances characterized by pervasive worry,
fear, and related behavioral impairments. Collectively, they are the most prevalent form of
mental illness [1]—affecting up to 30% of American adults at some point—and they impose a
large societal burden of functional disability and mortality [2]. Excessive anxiety is also associ-
ated with numerous negative health outcomes, such as increased risk of coronary heart disease
[3], impaired sleep [4], and alcohol and substance abuse [5]. Although there now exist several
established medication- and psychotherapy-based treatments for anxiety [6], many patients
still experience a poor treatment response [7, 8]. The widespread and debilitating nature of
anxiety, in tandem with the frequent inadequacy of existing treatments, points to the desirabil-
ity of exploring and developing novel approaches to treatment.
One particularly promising area of investigation involves manipulation of the intestinal
microbiota, the diverse collection of symbiotic microorganisms residing within the human gut
[9]. The microbiota communicates with the central nervous system via a collection of bidirec-
tional neural, metabolic, and immune pathways known as the microbiota-gut-brain axis [10].
Microbiota dysfunction—most commonly, the relative loss of beneficial gut microbes—is asso-
ciated with numerous types of physical and mental illness, ranging from irritable bowel syn-
drome to Alzheimer’s disease to depression [11]. The experience of anxiety is closely
interrelated with disordered gut function, to such an extent that commonly reported symp-
toms of anxiety often involve intestinal distress (e.g. upset stomach or nausea), and the severity
and duration of abdominal pain are associated with elevated anxiety [12]. Moreover, anxiety
frequently co-occurs with gastrointestinal disorders, such as irritable bowel syndrome, Crohn’s
disease, and ulcerative colitis [13, 14]—all of which are also linked with microbiota dysfunc-
tion [11]. Antibiotic use, which can profoundly reduce the gut’s bacterial diversity [15], has
also been found to increase the risk of developing an anxiety disorder later in life [16]. Finally,
gastrointestinal disturbance caused by pathogens can elicit anxiety. Intestinal infections in
humans are associated with increased risk of developing an anxiety disorder over the next two
years [17], and healthy mice infected with a foodborne pathogen have been shown to rapidly
display increased anxiety-like behavior [18], even in the absence of a detectable immune
response [19], suggesting that such microorganisms can directly interact with neural
pathways.
The most common way of addressing microbiota dysfunction and associated illness is
through the supplemental administration of probiotics (beneficial microorganisms). Recent
meta-analyses have found that probiotic intervention successfully reduces symptoms of both
irritable bowel syndrome [20] and ulcerative colitis [21]. Probiotics are even emerging as a rec-
ommended treatment for antibiotic-associated adverse events in children [22]. Additionally,
there is early evidence that probiotics may have psychotropic effects. Tillisch et al. [23], for
example, demonstrated that the consumption of probiotics altered emotional processing in the
brains of healthy women. Probiotics have also been shown to improve self-reported mood in
otherwise healthy adults experiencing negative affect [24]. And animal studies have found that
pretreatment with probiotics can protect against the neurological damage induced by both
acute and chronic stress [25, 26]. Given that these findings came from healthy humans (and
animals), they suggest that probiotics may have beneficial effects even in the absence of clinical

 disease. This leaves open the possibility that probiotics may be useful for both disease preven-
tion and treatment via different underlying mechanisms.
Several recent reviews have summarized the extant literature regarding probiotics and anxi-
ety [27–29]. Probiotics appear to be capable of reducing anxiety-like behavior in animals [29],
although the impact of probiotics on anxiety in humans is less certain, with recent narrative
reviews arriving at differing conclusions [27–29]. Notably, the overall effect of probiotics on
anxiety has yet to be quantified for either preclinical or clinical research. Accordingly, the goal
of this study was to comprehensively summarize and quantify the existing evidence on the
relationship between probiotics and anxiety. To do so, systematic reviews and meta-analyses
were performed on both preclinical and clinical studies, respectively.
Methods
The preclinical and clinical reviews followed CAMARADES and PRISMA guidelines for con-
ducting systematic reviews and meta-analyses, respectively [30, 31]. The study was not prereg-
istered, and the protocol can be viewed at https://dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.nsadeae.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria were selected to maximize the acquisition of all possible stud-
ies that examined the effects of probiotic administration on anxiety-like behavior in rodents or
symptoms of anxiety in humans. Conference abstracts were omitted due to a lack of necessary
information.
Preclinical criteria
Preclinical studies were deemed eligible if they met the following inclusion criteria: 1) subjects
were either rats or mice; 2) a probiotic was experimentally administered; 3) anxiety-like behav-
ior was measured.
Studies that met one or more of the following criteria were excluded: 1) there was no
matched control group; 2) the probiotic was not living at time of administration (e.g. heat-
killed); 3) the probiotic was not administered directly to the tested subject (e.g. administered
to the mother of infant rodent); 4) means, standard deviations, and sample sizes were not avail-
able for the measured anxiety-like behavior; 5) the full text of the study was not available in
English.
Clinical criteria
Clinical studies were deemed eligible if they met the following inclusion criteria: 1) the study
described a randomized controlled trial; 2) at least one interventional arm administered a pro-
biotic; 3) an anxiety scale was used as a primary or secondary measure; 4) human participants
were included.
Studies that met one or more of the following criteria were excluded: 1) there was no
matched control group; 2) the probiotic was not living at time of administration (e.g. heat-
killed); 3) means, standard deviations, and sample sizes were not available for the anxiety mea-
surements; 4) the full text of the study was not available in English.
Search strategy
The systematic literature reviews were carried out using PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of Sci-
ence databases, from the earliest record of the databases to November 2017. Search terms
included Bifidobacterium OR lactobacillus OR probiotic AND anxiety (see S1 Appendix for
the exemplar PubMed preclinical and clinical search strategies). Relevant references from the
identified publications were also included. The title and abstract for each search result were

 then evaluated to identify potential studies, and, finally, full-texts were evaluated to determine
study inclusion. Screening and evaluation were performed in a standardized manner by two
independent reviewers (DR and SP). Disagreements during this process were resolved accord-
ing to the following process: 1) both reviewers independently reapplied the inclusion/exclusion
criteria to the study in question; 2) the two reviewers discussed the criteria until a consensus
was reached; 3) in cases for which a consensus could not be reached, it was planned for the
final decision to be made by an independent party (SI), although this was not necessary. The
flow charts of study selection can be viewed in Figs 1 and 2.
Data collection
Preclinical and clinical data was extracted from selected studies using custom forms and
included the following information based on CAMARADES and PRISMA guidelines [30, 31]:
1) study design characteristics, such as subject information (e.g. age, sex, health status, rodent
species) and type of intervention (e.g. probiotic composition, dosage, and duration); and 2)
outcome data (e.g. outcome measure, group sample sizes, mean value of effect, and group vari-
ance). Outcome data was included if it was derived from a measure of anxiety-like behavior or
anxiety symptoms—equivalency across measures was assumed for each meta-analysis. Data
for the final measurement of the interventional period was selected if the outcome was mea-
sured at multiple time periods. Potential study bias was evaluated using SYRCLE’s risk of bias
tool [32] for preclinical studies and the Cochrane Collaboration’s risk of bias tool [33] for clini-
cal studies. One reviewer (DR) extracted all included data, which was checked and confirmed
by a second reviewer (SP). Disagreements between reviewers during data extraction were
resolved by discussion.
One clinical study [34] reported only median values and interquartile range. In order to cal-
culate an SMD, the median value of the reported data was assumed to represent the mean and
the standard deviation was calculated by dividing the interquartile range by 1.35 [35].
When results were available only in graphical format, data was extracted using WebPlotDi-
gitizer graph digitization software [36]; graph digitization has been previously shown to be a
valid method for extracting study data [37], and WebPlotDigitizer has been recommend for
use in systematic reviews [38].
Finally, nine preclinical and 14 clinical authors were contacted and asked to provide further
information. Four preclinical and two clinical authors responded and provided additional
study data, which were included in the final study selection. Extracted data can be viewed in
Tables 1 and 2.
Statistical analyses
The preclinical and clinical meta-analyses were performed with R 3.2.5 software [39]. All anal-
yses were pre-specified unless otherwise stated. For each included study, the standardized
mean difference (SMD; also known as Hedges’ g) between the probiotic and matched control
groups was calculated for all continuous measures of anxiety-like behavior or anxiety symp-
toms. Confidence intervals were calculated for each SMD using a standard normal distribu-
tion. For both preclinical and clinical studies, sample size, probiotic duration, and probiotic
dose were assessed as moderating variables in individual meta-regressions. Separate subgroup
analyses were conducted on diseased (receiving experimental manipulations in addition to
probiotic or vehicle intervention) and naïve animals (receiving only probiotic or vehicle inter-
vention), as well as mouse and rat samples. Exploratory subgroup analyses were also per-
formed on studies that used matching individual or combined probiotic species, provided that
the probiotic was tested in at least three experimental groups. In humans, subgroup analyses

 were conducted on clinical (individuals with a medical or psychological illness) and healthy
samples. Multiple subgroups within a single study (e.g. different rodent strains or experimental
conditions) were included as independent SMDs, provided that each treatment group had a
separate, matched control group. When multiple probiotic treatment groups were compared
against the same control group, the results from the different probiotic groups were combined,
and the SMD was calculated from the combined results [35].
If multiple measures of anxiety-like behavior or anxiety symptoms were reported in a single
study, a separate SMD was calculated for each outcome. To account for the dependency

 between SMDs measured in the same sample, robust variance estimation (RVE) meta-analyses
were used to estimate preclinical and clinical summary SMDs. RVE meta-analysis is a form of
random-effects meta-analysis that has been shown to address SMD dependency when the
covariances between outcomes measured in the same study are unknown [40]. In other words,
RVE allows for multiple outcomes from a single study to be included in a meta-analysis as sep-
arate SMDs; the weights are adjusted accordingly (i.e. the SMDs share a single study weight).
Precision (i.e. inverse variance) was used to weight SMDs.

 One clinical study included in the final analysis [41] utilized a cross-over experimental
design, but did not report the correlation between the interventional periods. A correlation of
0.5 was imputed to calculate the standard error of the SMD for the study. A sensitivity analysis,
using alternative correlational values to calculate the standard error, revealed that the choice of
correlational value did not impact the overall results of the clinical meta-analysis.
I2 was used to evaluate between-study heterogeneity. Values of I2 more than 25%, 50%, and
75% were selected to reflect low, moderate, and high heterogeneity, respectively, in accordance

mice. All but four studies [51, 53, 63, 64] reported using only male rodents. Fifteen of the 33
experimental groups modeled a form of disease and were exposed to additional manipulation,
such as social defeat [49], early-life stress [57], or induced chronic colitis [47]. Thirteen studies

 assessed anxiety-like behavior using an elevated plus maze, five studies used a light-dark
box test, two studies used a step-down test, nine studies used an open field test, and one study
observed behaviors related to anxiety during a maze task (eight studies employed multiple par-
adigms). Species from the Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Mycobacterium, and Streptococcus
genera were used as probiotics.
Bias assessment.
Table 3 shows the assessment of the risk of bias for the included studies.
No study provided sufficient detail regarding performance bias or detection bias, and only one
study provided detail regarding selection bias. This lack of reporting makes it difficult, if not
impossible, to accurately determine risk of bias. More detail was provided regarding the risk of
attrition bias, reporting bias, and other bias. Four studies had a high risk of reporting bias [49,
57, 60, 62], and three studies had a high risk of other bias [45, 53, 59]. A separate sensitivity
analysis revealed that removal of these studies did not substantively impact the results. Overall,
the risk of bias for each included study is unclear.
Probiotic efficacy.
Combining standardized mean differences (SMDs) for the 33 included
experimental groups revealed a pooled SMD of -0.47 (95% CI -0.77 –-0.16, p = 0.004; Fig 3).
Probiotic administration, compared to placebo, was shown to significantly reduce anxiety-like
behavior in rodents. Neither sample size (β = 0.01, 95% CI: -0.02–0.04, p = 0.432), probiotic
duration (β = 0.01, 95% CI: -0.02–0.04, p = 0.372), nor probiotic dose (β = -0.006, 95% CI:
-0.12–0.11, p = 0.906) provided a significant moderating influence.
Subgroup analyses revealed that probiotic administration significantly reduced anxiety-like
behavior in diseased (SMD = -0.81, 95% CI: -1.27 - -0.35, p = 0.002), but not in naïve animals

 (SMD = -0.16, 95% CI: -0.58–0.26, p = 0.433). Furthermore, probiotics significantly reduced
anxiety-like behavior in mice (SMD = -0.58, 95% CI: -0.90 –-0.26, p = 0.001), but not rats
(SMD = -0.17, 95% CI: -1.07–0.73, p = 0.678).
Four probiotics were selected for additional subgroup analyses based on their utilization in
multiple trials: Lactobacillus (L.) rhamnosus, Bifidobacterium (B.) pseudocatenulatum, L. plan-
tarum (four experimental groups each), and combined L. rhamnosus and L. helveticus (five
experimental groups). Only L. rhamnosus was shown to significantly reduce anxiety-like
behavior (SMD = -0.77, 95% CI: -1.40 –-0.13, p = 0.018). Anxiety-like behavior was not
affected by B. pseudocatenulatum (SMD = -0.24, 95% CI: -0.76–0.28, p = 0.368), L. plantarum
(SMD = -0.50, 95% CI: -1.37–0.38, p = 0.264), or combined L. rhamnosus and L. helveticus
(SMD = -0.61, 95% CI: -1.54–0.32, p = 0.201).
Publication bias and heterogeneity.
Visual inspection of a funnel plot (Fig 4) and the use
of an Egger test (t = -0.15, df = 55, p = 0.880) did not suggest the presence of publication bias,
although several SMDs fell outside of the expected area of the funnel plot. Factors other than
publication bias can contribute to funnel plot asymmetry, including heterogeneity and other
forms of bias [66]. There was moderate heterogeneity across the 33 experimental groups (I2 =
70.5%), indicating that 70.5% of the variation between study outcomes is attributable to incon-
sistency between the studies. Funnel plot asymmetry and heterogeneity are well-documented
problems present in meta-analyses of animal research [67]. Factors such as subject species/
strain, sample size, and additional experimental conditions can contribute to these issues,
although inclusion of study characteristics as moderating variables and subgroup analyses did
not reduce heterogeneity in the present analysis.
Clinical meta-analysis
Study selection and characteristics.
Fourteen studies [34, 41, 68–79], consisting of 1527
individuals, were included in the clinical meta-analysis (Fig 2 and Table 2). Eight studies
assessed the effect of probiotic administration on healthy samples, while six studies did so with
clinical samples. Of the six studies that used clinical participants, four studies investigated par-
ticipants with irritable bowel syndrome [69, 70, 72, 74], one study investigated participants
with at least moderate mood disturbance [73], and one study investigated participants with
cancer [79]. Two studies divided their participants receiving probiotic into low and high dose
groups [69, 70]. One study used a crossover randomized controlled trial design [41], while the
other 13 studies used a parallel design. Species from the Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Pedio-
coccus, Streptococcus, and Clostridium genera were used as probiotics.
Bias assessment.
The assessment for the included studies’ risk of bias can be viewed in
Table 4. All 14 studies had a low risk of attrition bias, and most studies had a low risk of both
reporting and other bias. Less than half of the studies included details regarding allocation
concealment. Overall, the risk of bias for each included study ranged from low to unclear.
Probiotic efficacy.
Combining standardized mean differences (SMDs) for the 14 included
studies revealed a pooled SMD of -0.12 (95% CI: -0.29–0.05, p = 0.151; Fig 5), indicating that
probiotic administration did not result in a significant reduction of anxiety. Neither sample
size (β = 0.00, 95% CI: 0.00–0.00, p = 0.746), probiotic duration (β = 0.00, 95% CI: -0.01–0.01,
p = 0.915), nor probiotic dose (β = 0.00, 95% CI: -0.01–0.01, p = 0.433) provided a moderating
influence. Additionally, subgroup analyses revealed that probiotic administration did not
result in a significant reduction of anxiety in healthy (SMD = -0.10, 95% CI: -0.33–0.13,
p = 0.283) or clinical participants (SMD = -0.33, 95% CI: -1.08–0.43, p = 0.312).
Publication bias and heterogeneity.
Visual inspection of Fig 6 demonstrated symmetry,
apart from one study [79], while the use of an Egger test similarly did not suggest the presence

 of publication bias (t = 1.52, df = 18, p = 0.146). There was also moderate heterogeneity across
the 14 included studies (I2 = 61.8%). Removal of the study by Yang et al. [79] resulted in low
heterogeneity (I2 = 21.7%); however, the results of the meta-analysis remained unchanged.

 Discussion
The present systematic review and meta-analysis of 22 preclinical studies (743 animals)
revealed a significant overall effect of probiotic administration in reducing anxiety-like behav-
ior in rodents. The observed pooled standardized mean difference (SMD) of -0.47 reflects a
medium-sized effect of probiotic interventions in comparison with non-probiotic controls. At
the level of individual trials, 12 of the 22 included animal studies found that probiotics

 significantly reduced anxiety-like behavior on at least one outcome measure, with the remain-
ing 10 studies finding either no effect or (in one case) increased anxiety-like behavior.
In contrast, only 3 of the 14 included clinical studies (encompassing 1527 individuals)
found that probiotics significantly reduced symptoms of anxiety. Notably, probiotics also
yielded no overall anxiolytic effects in the present meta-analysis. Subgroup analyses likewise
observed no significant probiotic effects among either healthy or diseased human participants.
These findings stand in stark contrast with the conclusions of two recent qualitative reviews,
both of which proposed that probiotics may have anxiolytic properties [27, 29]. However,
unlike such reviews, the present study utilized meta-analytic techniques to quantitatively eval-
uate the magnitude of probiotic effects on anxiety, as well as the degree to which the reported
effects of different studies varied. This approach also enabled the inclusion of multiple mea-
sures of anxiety from relevant studies in a single summary analysis. As such, the reported
results provide the only comprehensive review to date of the relevant research.

 In perhaps this study’s most important set of subgroup analyses, probiotics were found to
successfully reduce anxiety-like behavior in diseased, but not in healthy, rodents. Although the
utilized disease models varied considerably across studies—ranging from rodents with induced
intestinal inflammation [47, 48, 53] to those exposed to stressful conditions [49, 54, 59] to
those fed an unhealthy diet [44, 46]—they all reflected the presence of a pathological state that
might be associated with elevated stress or anxious arousal. It is possible, therefore, that the
anxiolytic effects of probiotics only occur above a baseline threshold level of heightened anx-
ious arousal. If so, this phenomenon could help explain the absence of an observed therapeutic
(anti-anxiety) effect of probiotic supplementation in our meta-analysis of human trials, inas-
much as none of the included studies specifically recruited participants on the basis of anxiety-
related symptomatology. Indeed, the majority (8) of included studies simply assessed the effect
of probiotics on self-reported anxiety levels among healthy, non-clinical participants. Another
four studies recruited patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) [69, 70, 72, 74], and
although such patients may sometimes experience elevated anxiety [13], it is not a defining fea-
ture of the disorder. The remaining two clinical studies likewise selected participants based on
criteria other than anxiety severity [73, 79]. Simply put: the general absence of clinically salient
anxiety among human participants in the extant probiotic literature may have obscured any
potential anxiolytic effects. Accordingly, it will be useful and informative for future investiga-
tions in this area to explicitly target participants characterized by clinically significant anxiety.
The discrepancy between preclinical and clinical studies may also be due to differences in
the way that anxiety was evaluated across these groups. Whereas anxiety in humans was
assessed entirely through self-report measures, anxiety in rodents was assessed through behav-
ioral observations. There is evidence that, during the treatment of emotion-based disorders
such as depression or anxiety, cognitive and behavioral processes improve prior to any subjec-
tive awareness of recovery, which may take weeks to be fully realized [80]. It is possible that
self-report questionnaires of anxiety are not sensitive enough to detect probiotic-induced
anxiolysis, at least under typically studied treatment durations. Only half of the included

 clinical studies administered probiotics for at least eight weeks, which is often used as an upper
cutoff when determining response to pharmacological treatments such as antidepressants. In
addition to longer treatment durations, alternative forms of assessment, such as functional
imaging techniques, may be needed in clinical studies to accurately measure the anxiolytic
impact of probiotics. Encouragingly, at least one study to date has demonstrated that probiot-
ics can alter emotional processing as measured by functional imaging [23].
In terms of the specific probiotic supplement regimens employed, the 14 relevant human
trials to date were characterized by such a high level of between-study heterogeneity that more
fine-grained analyses of individual probiotic species were precluded. However, the preclinical
studies were subjected to further subgroup analyses on the basis of four species of probiotic
that were each utilized in several studies. Among these four candidate species, only Lactobacil-
lus (L.) rhamnosus was found to significantly reduce anxiety-like behavior, with a rather large
standardized mean difference (SMD) of -0.77 across the relevant trials [49, 50, 52]. Each of the
L. rhamnosus studies used an administration duration of 28 days, with specific strains consist-
ing of L. rhamnosus JB-1 [49, 50] and L. rhamnosus GG MTCC 1408 [52]. Notably, L. rhamno-
sus was also the probiotic species used in one of the only studies to observe a significant
anxiolytic effect in humans [75]. This particular species has been widely investigated, and has
been shown to attenuate the symptoms of various gastrointestinal and allergic diseases [81].
Based on our results, it appears that L. rhamnosus may also have psychotropic properties, and
should be further and more extensively investigated for its anxiolytic potential.
Other probiotic species that were shown to significantly reduce anxiety-like behavior in
individual rodent studies include L. helveticus [55, 58], Bifidobacterium (B.) longum [47], B.
adolescentis [54], and combined L. rhamnosus and B. longum [48]. Conversely, one species of
probiotic was shown to increase anxiety-like behavior in rodents: L. casei [45]. While Lactoba-
cillus and Bifidobacterium species of bacteria are the most commonly investigated probiotics
[82], the different species are not identical, and even strains within the same species can have
unique effects on the body [83]. Because of this, candidate probiotics require extensive study
and characterization prior to clinical application.
Notably, the dose-response curve of probiotics also remains almost completely uninvesti-
gated when it comes to their potential psychoactive effects. In fact, the weight-adjusted probi-
otic dosages (colony-forming units per gram of body weight) used in the rodent trials
reviewed herein were typically hundreds of times larger than the corresponding dosages used in
the human trials. And this fact raises the possibility that the significant anxiolytic effect of sup-
plementation in the rodent meta-analysis and the null effect in the human meta-analysis both
reflect—at least in part—the much higher dosing schedule utilized with the rodents. The same
consideration could also help explain the more robust anxiolytic effect observed among mice
versus rats, as the mice typically received higher weight-adjusted probiotic doses by virtue of
being about 10 times smaller than rats, on average. By extension, it is conceivable that future
investigators could discover the most effectively anxiolytic probiotic dosages in humans to be
dozens—or perhaps even hundreds—of times higher than those employed to date.
It is possible that probiotics reduce anxiety-like behavior by influencing the immune sys-
tem, which is a primary component of the microbiota-gut-brain axis [10]. Many of the
included preclinical studies found the anxiolytic effects of probiotics to be accompanied by
beneficial alterations in immune functioning [49, 52, 54, 55, 57, 58]. And the microbiota con-
tinuously stimulates a complex and dynamic immune response by interacting with the intesti-
nal barrier [84]. Germ-free mice without a microbiota have an impaired immune response
[85], and induced dysbiosis has been linked with inflammatory bowel disease [86]. As such,
probiotics may improve mental health by restoring microbiota-mediated immune activation
to an adaptive level. Another possibility is that the anxiolytic effects observed herein were due

 to an alteration of activity in the vagus nerve, also a major connection between the microbiota
and the brain [10]. In fact, two of the reviewed preclinical studies found that inhibition of the
vagus nerve—a major pathway between the microbiota and the central nervous system [87]—
prevented probiotic-induced reductions of anxiety-like behavior [47, 50].
It should be emphasized that none of the analyzed preclinical studies provided sufficient
detail regarding risk of selection, performance, or detection biases, making it so that the overall
risk of bias for each preclinical study was unclear. Most clinical studies were similarly rated as
having an unclear risk of bias, especially within the domains of randomization, allocation con-
cealment, and blinding. As such, there is some concern that bias present in the included stud-
ies may be affecting the observed results. Failure to account for potential biases has been
shown to influence study outcomes and can lead to overestimation of observed effects [88, 89].
For example, animal studies that do not employ randomization procedures have been found to
have significantly higher standardized mean differences than those that do [90]. Furthermore,
an incomplete description of study methods can complicate replication efforts and evaluations
of study reliability. Poor reporting of bias risk criteria is a particular issue within the broader
preclinical literature, and certainly not isolated to probiotic research [91]. The use of appropri-
ate randomization, allocation concealment, and blinding procedures, as well as proper report-
ing thereof, will greatly aid preclinical and clinical probiotic development research.
Two of the 14 included clinical studies found that probiotic administration resulted in a sig-
nificant improvement of anxiety, compared to placebo, without contributing substantially to
statistical heterogeneity [69, 75]. Notably, Slykerman et al. [75] administered probiotics to
pregnant women for up to one year, the longest duration of any study included in this analysis.
Because the composition of the microbiota is relatively stable and at least somewhat resistant
to change induced by external disturbances, including probiotics [92]—and in light of evi-
dence that probiotics may only exert transient effects on the body [93, 94]—it is possible that
long-term probiotic supplementation is necessary to significantly alter the microbiota compo-
sition and induce beneficial changes in psychological functioning. It may also be that preg-
nancy represents a unique window for probiotic-based intervention, as there is evidence that
the microbiota changes drastically during pregnancy [95]. However, the variability of the
microbiota during pregnancy remains unknown and a recent longitudinal study by DiGiulio
et al. [96] found that the microbiotas of pregnant women are stable across time.
Lorenzo-Zuniga et al. [69] used a measure of gastrointestinal-specific anxiety—the Visceral
Sensitivity Index (VSI) [97]—in adults with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). While the VSI
does assess general anxiety, as evidenced by its strong convergent validity with other measures
of general anxiety, it also captures anxiety specific to gastrointestinal (GI) symptom severity
[97, 98]. Given this finding, it may be that probiotics are more effective at alleviating GI-spe-
cific anxiety than general anxiety, at least in individuals with abnormal GI functioning. Probi-
otics specifically interact with the GI tract and appear to be well-suited for the treatment of GI
distress. Indeed, a recent systematic review and meta-analysis has found that probiotics suc-
cessfully reduce GI symptom severity in individuals with IBS while improving the integrity of
the intestinal barrier [20]. However, it may be that probiotic-induced reductions in GI-specific
anxiety are attributable to a reduction in GI symptoms, as Lorenzo-Zuniga et al. [69] found
that GI-related quality of life improved prior to GI-specific anxiety. Another possibility is that
probiotics are more effective at reducing anxiety in individuals with GI dysfunction, due to the
presence of a more impaired microbiota; however, the other three clinical studies in this analy-
sis that selected subjects with IBS found that probiotics had no effect on general anxiety [70,
72, 74].

 Limitations
One important limitation of this study was the substantial heterogeneity present among both
preclinical and clinical studies reviewed. Subject characteristics, outcome measures, probiotic
strain (including single versus multispecies preparations), probiotic dose, and probiotic dura-
tion all varied substantially from study to study, and such variation likely contributed to the
observed high level of statistical heterogeneity, which is problematic as high heterogeneity
reduces the predictive validity of meta-analyses [99]. Although the use of random-effects mod-
els, as done here, can help to account for such heterogeneity [99], appropriate caution still
needs to be taken when interpreting the present results, as they may not accurately reflect the
true effect of probiotics.
Another limitation was that only 14 studies were included in the clinical meta-analysis, due
to a lack of relevant research attributable to the novelty of using probiotics as a psychotropic
intervention. The presence of more human trials could provide greater insight into the anxio-
lytic potential of probiotics and would also allow for more nuanced subgroup analyses. Addi-
tional preclinical research is similarly needed, as each preclinical subgroup analysis often
encompassed only a handful of relevant standardized mean differences. A third limitation is
that preclinical sample sizes (typically ranging from 10–40 animals) tended to be much smaller
than those found in clinical studies. Although publication bias—a major concern when it
comes to small sample size—was not observed among the included preclinical studies, small
sample sizes may exacerbate other biases that can negatively affect the reliability and validity of
study outcomes [100]. This may help explain the differential impact of probiotics observed in
preclinical and clinical studies.
Conclusion
While probiotic administration reduces anxiety-like behavior in rodents, the current state of
clinical research does not (yet) support probiotics as an efficacious treatment for anxiety. Lac-
tobacillus rhamnosus was nonetheless identified as a candidate anxiolytic probiotic species by
both preclinical and clinical studies. An important target of future clinical investigation is the
examination of the impact of probiotics on clinically significant anxiety, as probiotics only sig-
nificantly reduced anxiety-like behavior in diseased rodents. It may also be worthwhile to
investigate both higher dosages and longer durations of probiotic administration, as well as the
effect of probiotics on specific subtypes of anxiety, such as anxiety related to gastrointestinal
distress.
