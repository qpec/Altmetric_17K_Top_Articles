Abstract
Introduction
Increasing longevity means more people will be dying in very old age, but little is known
about the preferences of the ‘oldest old’ regarding their care at the end of life.
Aims
To understand very old people’s preferences regarding care towards the end of life and atti-
tudes towards dying, to inform policy and practice.
Methods
Qualitative data collection for n = 42 population-based cohort study participants aged 95–
101 (88% women, 42% in long-term-care): topic-guided interviews with n = 33 participants
and n = 39 proxy informants, most with both (n = 30: 4 jointly + separate interviews for 26
dyads).
Results
Death was a part of life: these very old people mainly live day-to-day. Most were ready to die,
reflecting their concerns regarding quality of life, being a nuisance, having nothing to live for
and having lived long enough. Contrasting views were rare exceptions but voiced firmly.
Most were not worried about death itself, but concerned more about the dying process and
impacts on those left behind; a peaceful and pain-free death was a common ideal. Attitudes
ranged from not wanting to think about death, through accepting its inevitable approach to
longing for its release. Preferring to be made comfortable rather than have life-saving treat-
ment if seriously ill, and wishing to avoid hospital, were commonly expressed views. There

 was little or no future planning, some consciously choosing not to. Uncertainty hampered
end-of-life planning even when death was expected soon. Some stressed circumstances,
such as severe dependency and others’ likely decision-making roles, would influence
choices. Carers found these issues harder to raise but felt they would know their older rela-
tives’ preferences, usually palliative care, although we found two discrepant views.
Conclusions
This study’s rare data show �95-year-olds are willing to discuss dying and end-of-life care
but seldom do. Formal documentation of wishes is extremely rare and may not be welcome.
Although being “ready to die” and preferring a palliative approach predominated, these pref-
erences cannot be assumed.
Introduction
Living longer means dying older. Demographic changes mean more people are living their last
years in very old age.[1] How does this affect their attitudes towards death, dying and care
towards the end of life? The experiences and preferences of ‘older old’ people, or their carers,
are rarely heard, but their voices are crucial to shaping end-of-life care services to reflect the
priorities of increasingly older people approaching death.
The existing literature on end of life preferences and experiences of older people is limited,
and particularly so in relation to very old people.[2;3] Research to date has typically sought
bereaved relatives’ views,[4–8] though some pioneering studies with older people have been
largely in long-term care settings,[9–13] occasionally with just community-dwelling older peo-
ple,[14–18] but to our knowledge none so very old and none except our cohort[19] taking a
population-based approach.
The present study informs policy, planning and practice by exploring thoughts on death
and dying and preferences for end-of-life care with a representative sample of very old
people—over-95-year-olds, their relatives and formal carers.
Methods
A qualitative interview was added to the regular quantitative survey data collection at the 7th
wave follow-up (Year 21) of a longitudinal study of ageing, the Cambridge City over-75s
Cohort (CC75C) study. Full study methods have are described elsewhere[20] (http://www.
cc75c.group.cam.ac.uk/). The original population-based sample (n = 2166, 95% response rate)
enrolled in 1985/87 using general practice lists have been re-interviewed every few years follow-
ing Cambridge Research Ethics Committee approval and renewed consent. To avoid under-
representation of the most frail, proxy informants were also interviewed. Interviews were con-
ducted face-to-face in the interviewee’s usual home or occasionally, with proxies, by phone.
Mortality was the main source of attrition.
In this Survey 7, following completion of the CC75C interviewer-administered structured
questionnaire (http://www.cc75c.group.cam.ac.uk/pages/questionnaires), participants were
invited to a further interview “more like a conversation than the usual survey” with the aim of
understanding “what it is like to be so old, your experiences of care and your views on some of
these issues that are more complex than a survey can explore.” A topic guide of open-ended
questions (http://www.cc75c.group.cam.ac.uk/pages/additionaldata) explored issues

 participants had raised in past surveys, where quantitative methods had been inadequate to
fully explore the depth of responses. When proxy informants were interviewed, they were
asked what they believed would be the response from the older person as well as their own
views and experiences. Multiple strategies maximised inclusion of these very old and often frail
participants in qualitative data collection [see Box 1].
To maximise the value of these data sources, the entirety of this relatively large qualitative
archive was included in the analysis. A descriptive thematic analysis was conducted using a
framework approach,[21] which facilitates working with large data sets, particularly where data
collection is more structured, and where co-researchers share analysis. NVivo software (http://
www.qsrinternational.com/products_nvivo.aspx) was used to manage and index the data prior
to charting, mapping and interpretation. The analysis team, trained in framework analysis,
consisted of two to three analysts at any one time (four individuals trained in qualitative meth-
ods) working independently, in parallel and together at various steps of the analytic process.
Results
Of 54 study participants alive when Survey 7 started, 6 died before they could be interviewed.
Of the 48 remaining, 44 (92%) took part in the usual survey. Qualitative data were collected for
all but two people. For the majority (n = 30, 71%) both the participant and a proxy informant
were interviewed, usually separately (n = 26) or for a few jointly (n = 4). For a small minority
(n = 3, 7%) only the participant was interviewed and for one in five (n = 9, 21%) only proxy
interviews were possible [see Fig 1]. All but six proxy informants were relatives, most com-
monly daughters (n = 20) or sons (n = 7); non-family included care-home staff, a live-in care-
assistant and a friend. Participants were aged 95–101, mainly women (n = 37, 88%); 57% were
community-dwelling (n = 20 in private dwellings, half of these living alone, n = 4 alone in shel-
tered accommodation) [see Table 1 for further demographics]. The full archive for qualitative

 analysis comprised 112 source documents (1269 pages) including anonymised transcripts from
95.5 hours of audio-recordings from 91 interviews relating to 42 older people.
Analyses yielded three main topics: 1) the context, beliefs and outlooks framing the lives of
our very old study participants; 2) their attitudes towards dying and death; 3) their preferences
concerning end-of-life care. Findings are presented below in sub-themes of each topic with
sample comments (all names and identifying details have been changed) [see Box 2 for the-
matic overview].
1) Context, beliefs & outlooks
Participants vividly described the context in which they were living their later years, a context
where contemporaries’ deaths heightened awareness of dying, though interviews revealed con-
siderable variation in views on readiness to die or not, medicalisation of dying, euthanasia and
life outlook.
1a) Everyone dying.
The age of these older people was so great that most of their
contemporaries had died. Their circles of friends and family had diminished and death was a
regular feature of life, leading some to question why they were still alive.

 “As people get older, as their friends die, there’s an element of ticking them off [laughing]”
(2930-proxy)
One proxy measured this by the size of her mother’s Christmas card list–“down to five
now”–and quoted her frequently asking “for at least ten years ‘Why am I still here? All my
friends have gone.’”(1077-proxy)
However, there were positive outlooks. One proxy described her mother as a survivor,
acknowledging deaths of others but able to carry on; others celebrated their survival:
“. . .they became great buddies. And I do think she was sad when she died, but [. . .] she didn't
miss a beat [. . .], she carried on with her life. So I think there's obviously the survival thing
there.”
(3103-proxy)
Thus, for many, death and dying framed their outlook on their remaining lives. Some
spoke, more negatively, of being on borrowed time:
“Maybe she feels she’s on borrowed time.[. . .] She’s had underlying heart problems over time,
so she must have had a sort of taste of her own mortality.”
(142-proxy)
Most knew, and accepted, that they were going to die soon. Their lives had been long and
were coming to an end.
Daughter: We haven’t bought her new clothes for ten years.[. . .] ‘It’s not worth it, dear’ [. . .]
Same for the teeth,[. . .] she won’t do anything about her teeth [. . .]
Son-in-law: I think the best one was the long life bulb that she gave our daughter ‘Something
for you, it’s not worth me having a/
Daughter: /a long life bulb!’
(1077-proxy)
For some this was only a recent realisation, sometimes triggered by illness. A few indicated
that, although towards the end of their life, they did not see the end as imminent:
Interviewer: But if you think of your life as a journey, how do you feel about being at the par-
ticular spot where you are now in the journey?
Participant: Oh dear, that’s difficult. Well, I would say just over three-quarters of the way
through.
(3124)
1b) Ready to die.
Most felt ready to die, describing “waiting for it to happen”:
“I’m ready to go. I just say I’m the lady in waiting [. . .] waiting to go.”
(645)

 “She doesn’t read anymore since her glasses were lost and she doesn’t want new ones. She’s
waiting to die.”
(3547-proxy)
Some linked this to quality of life:
Interviewer: Would you say that you enjoy your life?
Participant: I’m past it.
(2882)
Some felt they were a nuisance to others:
“I wish I could snuff it [. . .] I’m only in the way.”
(2804)
Some were more desperate in their desire to reach the end, sometimes linking this to their
longevity, or suggesting they had simply lived too long:
“‘Please don’t let me live ‘til I’m a hundred’ she said.”
(148-proxy)
Others described having nothing to live for and having had enough:
Interviewer: How are you today?
Participant: [laughs] Lousy as usual [. . .] I wish I wasn’t here.
Interviewer: [. . .] Why is that then?
Participant: Well, nothing to. . . nothing to live for.
(1077)
Some had cried about it:
“I wake up in the morning and think what the hell am I here for and I’ll cry.”
(3346)
For others these feelings varied—they wished for death on bad days but on better days the
will to live remained.
“Some days she gets a bit fed up or cross. She'll say, ‘Oh I wish I wasn't here!’ Or something
like that [. . .] And another day she's completely the opposite.”
(3504-proxy)
1c) Medicalisation postponing death.
Well-intended medical interventions were viewed
negatively as prolonging life by a handful of interviewees, an issue usually, but not exclusively,
raised by proxy informants. One care home manager offered the explanation that “in hospitals
they do feel [. . .] death is not something they want, so they will over-medicalise because it’s better

 than doing nothing”(142-proxy). She exemplified this with the ethical issues posed by enteral
tube feeding decisions: “It’s harder to take the thing out than to put one in.”(142-proxy) How-
ever, relatives questioned the logic of some medical practices:
“I was annoyed [. . .] the doctor gave her her pneumonia injection [. . .]—she had no quality
of life. . . was ready to go [. . .] [but] there was no consultation with us at all about it. [. . .] I
was very angry with him.”
(3403-proxy)
One 98-year-old couldn’t “see any point in keeping people alive”(2999), confirmed in a sepa-
rate interview with her niece: “She thinks it’s absolute nonsense being kept alive. And that every-
body here [care home] is being kept alive. [. . .] she will come out every now and then with [. . .]
‘you look after us too well’” (2999-proxy). This was reiterated more strongly by a daughter
whose mother thought it “bloody silly keeping people [alive]”(1077-proxy).
1d) Euthanasia.
A step on from this, another daughter struggled with her perception that
“it seems to be society’s mentality that they keep you alive anyhow [. . .] regardless”(2961-proxy).
A son with similar doubts described a vivid memory of accompanying his mother to visit one
of her friends with dementia following several strokes:
“When she had her marbles, she said ‘Gordon, [. . .] if I ever get like that, for goodness sake
put a. . .’, it was her words, not mine, ‘put a pillow over my head, will you?’. . . But of course
you can’t. If she was compos mentis enough to realise [. . .] the state she was in, she would be
very upset.”
(2916-proxy).
Another daughter said her mother would ask ‘why don’t they put me out of my misery? It’s
pointless me lying here”(3211-proxy). One relative took a stern line in response to such com-
ments, voicing a key dilemma:
“I’ve had to be quite firm with her and said ‘Well, this is your lot, you have to accept it. [. . .] If
you don’t commit suicide [. . .] why put the responsibility of dying onto anybody else? That’s
not fair.’”
(2999-proxy)
Two daughters whose mothers had repeatedly expressed similar wishes considered potential
legal repercussions and expressed doubts:
“Someone would be assisting, wouldn’t they, if they gave her something to end her life?”
(1162-proxy)
“We’ve sort of been in sympathy with euthanasia [. . .] [but] when it actually comes to that
moment, to one’s nearest and dearest, it is actually another factor. I don’t know.”
(3124-proxy).
Another daughter raised assisted dying: “If you offered her to go to Switzerland or Holland or
wherever, she’d go. She’s been ready [. . .] for a long time.”(1077-proxy), but recognised her
mother’s ability to act on her wishes had diminished as her desire to die increased.
1e) Not ready to die.
However, for some the will to live remained strong:

 Interviewer: Do you sometimes think that life isn’t worth living?
Participant: No. I don’t think of things like that.
(1110)
“He’s not looking forward to not being here. He’s still got the life force very strongly.”
(2930-proxy)
1f) Outlook on remaining life.
Many of the older people referred to “taking each day as it
comes”, expressing thankfulness for where they were in life and content, at this stage, to take
life one day at a time, not worrying too much about tomorrow. There was a sense of life ticking
along until something drastic happened.
“It is only day-from-day when you get to ninety-seven.”
(3103)
Faith, or a lack of faith, provided a framework for end-of-life care preferences for some.
Interviewer: How do you feel about the future, how do you think things will work out for you?
Participant: Well, being a Christian, I leave it to the Lord, yeah, what he wills.
(1150)
“I’m an atheist, or an agnostic, so I’ve no belief in a second. . . in a further life. I think it will
be just as it was in the thousands of years before I was born.”
(2930)
For some, however, their preferences for how they would like to die outweighed their beliefs:
“She used to say ‘if I ever got cancer now, forget the chemotherapy and I wish there was some-
thing that I could be given to end my life peacefully’ [. . .] And yet she was quite a religious
woman.”
(1162-proxy)
2) Attitudes towards dying and death
Thinking about death, talking about death and what might follow death emerged as separate
themes in the interviews.
2a) Thoughts about dying.
As well as framing their thoughts on their remaining life, the
deaths of others and faith perspectives provided a context for thoughts about death and dying.
Most were not afraid of dying, either reporting it did not worry them or proxies saying they
had not expressed any worries or fears about it:
“I’m not afraid of dying [. . .] at my age anything can happen.”
(645)
For some this absence of fear was rooted in positive experiences of others’ dying:

 “When I look back in my family, my parents. They were alive, then they were dead, but it all
went off as usual. Nothing really dramatic or anything [. . .] Why should it be any different
for me?”
(1502)
But where the experience of others’ deaths had been negative, there was worry—not about
death itself, but the process of dying:
“[My aunt] found my mother’s end quite distressing, because she [pause] was not herself for
quite a long time before she died. My mum was in hospital for a long time, and then in the
home. [. . .] I think she worries that she’s going to be like that when the end comes.”
(2882-proxy)
Worries about death also related to the impact death might have on others. This usually
related to the emotional impact on the family or resulting loneliness for a remaining partner,
but also to financial concerns.
“The only thing I’m worried about is my sister. I hope that she’ll be not sad and be able to
come to terms with it.”
(1502)
“[. . .] he got awfully worried about money”
(3185-proxy)
A few reported thinking about death and dying, suggesting it was a worry, but for most it
was something occasionally crossing their minds and not a great concern.
“I suppose it comes across everybody. . . occasionally, but I wouldn’t make a mountain out of
it”
(1502)
“Never given it much thought.”
(2888)
There were some who stated explicitly that they didn’t think about, or preferred not to think
about, or discuss, death. A care manager proxy suggested this was born out of fear.
“Some [. . .] wouldn’t even broach the subject [. . .] it was like tempting fate”
(142-proxy)
Death was welcomed where it was seen as a release. One older person said he was not afraid
of death as it meant there was probably something wrong. Others felt death was both inevitable
and approaching.
“I’m not frightened to die, if that’s what you mean. No, not at all. I mean there isn’t any other
future.”
(3103)
The older people and their proxies seemed to accept this inevitability quite philosophically
as beyond their control: “Well, it’s no good making a fuss. If you can’t alter it, abide by it.”(1079)

 Despite the inevitability of death, its trigger, process and timing remained uncertain.
Participant: [. . .] that’s if I go first. She may go first.
Sister: Well, it’s something we don’t know, isn’t it? [. . .] Just can’t say.
Participant: That is the reason, my love, for just letting it drift with the tide.
(1502)
Death could be unpredictably sudden: “[. . .] supposing I collapsed and went suddenly? I sort
of always have a little bit of doubt at the back of my mind.”(1433)
Or it could be a prolonged process involving a period of greater care need which might
require planning, recognised as difficult without foresight:
“But you can’t really plan the end of your life can you? How do I know if there’s gonna be
someone here to look after me.”
(1502)
For some their survival this long had itself been unpredictable:
“[He] had said at [his] 80th ‘I shan't be here much longer‴(1516) [now aged 99]
2b) Talking about death.
Proxies reported that death was rarely talked about:
“That generation, they didn’t actually discuss death much, I don’t think, my parents, at all.”
(1162-proxy)
Some described conversations that alluded to death but didn’t go as far as explicitly discuss-
ing it:
“She doesn’t talk about dying. She just talks about it being time she wasn’t here [. . .] Which
means the same.”
(2882-proxy)
But a few described openly talking about death and the future.
“[. . .] the other day [. . .] she said, ‘I should think I’ll snuff it soon, don’t you?’ I said, ‘I don’t
know, you tell me’ and she just laughs. I mean, she. . . You can laugh with her about it, you
know. [. . .] She’s never morbid”
(2804-proxy)
2c) Talking about funerals.
Discussion of funeral preferences was more common than
talking about death, although the extent of discussions varied. Some had made their prefer-
ences clear:
“Father [. . .] said, ‘Don’t forget I want to be buried up at the city cemetery’. And it came out
in conversation that my mother [. . .] wants to be cremated [. . .] Father reminds us

 occasionally [. . .] ‘Don’t forget!’[laughs]”
(1516+1523-proxy)
“She’s told me where everything is and what I’ve got to do. She’s sorted all that out a long time
ago.”
(1540-proxy)
Some had made the plans themselves and paid for their funerals in advanced:
“She’s written her little sort of obituary of herself and her life. [. . .] She did this a few years
back, which is just as well she did before. . .”
(1162-proxy)
“I’ve paid for my funeral.[. . .], did that several years go”
(645)
Others had no preferences or were content to leave arrangements to their families:
“I can quite safely leave it with them to make arrangements.”
(1150)
Some had simply not discussed it:
Interviewer: Has she talked to you about the funeral?
Participant: No. No. No. No, it’s not something I’d bother her with, because [. . .] Mum knows
that I’d do what she would want anyway.
(2804-proxy)
Others noted the difficulties of discussing funerals:
“I did ask her when she wasn’t well. I said, “Do you think you would want to be buried or cre-
mated?” And she said, ‘Well, cremated, I think.’[. . .] [. . .] I find it very difficult talking to her.
I don’t feel that I can. You see, I say to my children ‘Oh, that’s a nice song on the radio. Oh,
perhaps I’ll have that at my funeral’ [laughter]. And you couldn’t to my mum”
(1079-proxy)
2d) The manner of dying.
The manner of death was of more concern than its imminence.
Although some said they had not really thought about dying, many explicitly expressed the
wish to die peacefully, pain free and preferably while asleep—to “just slip away quietly.”(3194)
Indeed death coming suddenly was seen as positive:
“I’d be quite happy if I went [snaps fingers] suddenly like that.”
(3403)
Relatives echoed the same wishes for their loved ones:
“I just hope that she doesn’t get a [. . .] catastrophic illness that she’s going to suffer. I would
just like her to sleep one day, you know, because I don’t want her to have to go through

 anything else.”
(2888-proxy)
“I think I would love [. . .] her to live as long as she feels she wants to. And then I would love
her to keel over. I mean. . . Wouldn’t that be wonderful for all of us?”
(3124-proxy)
3) Preferences concerning end-of-life care
By and large, interviewees talked readily about end-of-life care preferences.
3a) Preferences regarding life-saving treatment. When asked whether, if they had a life-
threatening illness, they would “want to receive treatment that would save [your] life or prefer
treatment that would just make [you] comfortable”, preferences for life-saving treatment were
unusual and even tentative:
Interviewer: [. . .] would you want the doctors to go all out with treatment and so on?
Participant: Well yes, I should think so. Yes.
(1110)
“Make me comfortable”(2952) was a far more typical response and proxy informants tended
to echo the older people’s dominant preference for comfort rather than life-saving treatment:
“I would say she would just like to be made comfortable.”
(1540-proxy)
The term “life-threatening” in our questioning signified to some that quality of life would be
threatened, prompting qualifying responses: “I wouldn’t want a thing like these terrible things
where people go on living and deteriorating”(2930). Some felt their preference would very much
depend on specific circumstances.
“. . .whether it could be treatment that I could get about or I had to be bedridden”
(1079)
“I haven’t thought about it. It’s a decision you can’t make unless you’re in that position.”
(3103)
Relatives were similarly aware of the complexity of the uncertainties.
“Well, that’s a difficult question, because it’s all according to how she would be. [. . .] when
you get to that stage, to resuscitate somebody at 96 I think is a bit odd. But, on the other hand,
my mother has quite a strong spirit, [. . .] she would probably want that.” [. . .] [addressing
mother] “If you had a bad stroke, mother, and I knew you were gonna be paralysed, and you
couldn’t think for yourself, and they said to me ‘Shall we resuscitate your mother?’, I would
say ‘No.’”
(645-proxy)
Older people were fatalistic about decisions being made by others.

April 5, 2016

 “Well, whatever’s thought necessary.”
(1433)
Some stated that they would leave such decisions to others—relatives, health professionals
or even God.
“Her son’s been taking the decisions for the last ten, fifteen years perhaps.[. . .] That’s just
[. . .] yet one more decision that he will take, because she’s just handed decisions over to him.”
(3403-proxy)
“I never thought about that. I think it should be left to the doctor.[. . .] Well, what do we have
doctors for if when anything happens we drop them?”
(2888)
Interviewer: And you’ve talked a bit about [. . .] religion and feeling that it’s in God’s hands,
what happens from now on.
Participant: Yes, yes.
Interviewer: Is that something that you think about quite a bit?
Participant: No, it’s just part of my faith. I can just leave it with confidence.
(1150)
Trust in those to whom decision-making is passed was considered crucial.
“He trusts his doctor enough to know that his doctor wouldn’t advise it unless it was essential
[. . .] so if his doctor said he had to, he would go [to hospital] because he trusts [. . .] him, and
we would too. [. . .] That’s very important.”
(2930-proxy)
It tended to be older people themselves who said they had discussed their preferences:
“My family know my feelings about Alzheimer’s. They do know that. The doctor knows it.”
(1433)
“I think they would know my views on that.[. . .] which would not be to continue life, [. . .] I
once mentioned to my doctor [. . .] and he said ‘Well, I’ve made a note on your file saying no
heroics.’”
(2930)
It was relatives who reported never having had any such discussion:
“She hasn’t said [. . .] I don’t really know.”
(1110-proxy)
“We haven’t discussed that at all. [. . .] And I couldn’t put words into her mouth I don’t think.
[. . .] And of course when it does happen it’s possibly too late to think about it.”
(1111-proxy)

 3b) Admission to hospital at the end of life.
Asking about life-saving treatment often
elicited views, mostly negative, regarding hospital admission. Only one woman said she had
“not given it any thought”(148) and one daughter thought her mother would positively wel-
come it: “That’s where she thinks you get proper care.”(1077-proxy). The minority happy to go
to hospital qualified this with particular circumstances: “If I had an accident or something like
that.”(1110). Most were quite adamant about not wanting this–“I should hate it [. . .] I just
wouldn’t like it.”(2916)–but rarely gave reasons, though one care home manager explained:
“If she went to [hospital] quite poorly, I think she would be full of anxiety and I think it would
exacerbate any illness she had. I think she would find it alarming actually.”
(3103-proxy)
Many older people recognised hospital admission might arise despite preferences against
this: “Well, I’d have to go I suppose”(1516). This was sometimes voiced in tones of acceptance,
albeit reluctant:
“It would be selfish not to go somewhere where I can be looked after. It’s not fair to them [. . .]
I would have to accept it [. . .] shouldn’t really like it. [I’d rather] stay put.”
(1079)
Others were more pragmatic; whether someone was admitted or not was occasionally
viewed as neither here nor there:
“If they want me in the hospital, I suppose they’ll take me. [. . .] I think you’re beyond caring”
(1077)
Family members were often aware of preferences, one niece linking this with her aunt not
wanting to go into long-term-care either:
“She's dead against going. [. . .] She doesn't like hospitals. She doesn't want to go. [. . .] I think
she thinks [. . .] to go to bed and go to sleep [. . .] without going into hospital, I think that's her
ideal, just dying in her own home. [. . .] I do know that she's so against going into a home or
hospital.”
(2952-proxy)
Another used the phrase “I wouldn’t put her in hospital anymore”(148-proxy), often heard in
relation to moving older relatives into care.
3c) Family members’ wishes for their relatives.
There were clear parallels between what
the proxy informants tended to say they thought their older relatives wanted, as described
above, and what they wished for on behalf of their older relatives. Very similar themes emerged
as their most common hopes—avoiding any suffering, hospital admission or prolonging of life,
and achieving a peaceful death at home or in a familiar care home.
“Kept comfortable. That’s what I would want for her really.”
(2804-proxy)
Relatives echoed the older participants’ awareness that, regardless of preferences, decision-
making may be taken over by others:
Death and the Oldest Old: Attitudes and Preferences for End-of-Life Care
PLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0150686
April 5, 2016
16 / 25
 “I mean, in the end it may ultimately be our decision anyhow, rather than hers”
(2961-proxy)
Only one proxy informant, not a relative but a care home manager, expressed more general
views about the manner and place of death:
“To die in the home she regards as home is definitely more dignified and gentler, because she
is surrounded by people she knows.”
(3103-proxy)
3d) Family members’ understanding of their older relatives’ preferences.
Occasionally a
relative explicitly conveyed the difficulty of understanding how their elderly parent felt:
“I wonder sometimes if she wants to live to 100. [. . .] to say that she’s done it, you know.”
(1079-proxy)
A few mentioned views expressed in the past, for example before dementia had limited the
ability to discuss preferences:
“Knowing Mum’s opinion from the past, I said I thought it would be kinder just let her go
without this extra effort of resuscitating the heart and so on.”
(3149-proxy)
Far more commonly family and paid carers commented that the older person they cared for
had never specifically discussed care preferences with them.
“She knows she's going to die one day. I mean, we all do. But she never really mentions saying
that she wants to go here or any of that.”
(3504-proxy)
However, by far the majority felt they knew their relative well enough to predict their views:
“I would expect [. . .] she would do what [her sisters] have all done.[. . .] and that’s just take
water.[. . .] When [. . .] life had become too much of a burden [. . .] they just put themselves
onto water only until they faded away. And I would expect that she would probably, if she
had the nouse, do that.”
(2999-proxy)
Most tended to voice what they understood the older person’s preferences to be as definitive
statements, rarely phrased with any uncertainty:
“She doesn't believe in a lot of highfaluting interventions.[. . .] Nature will take its course. And
if it is on the cards that any particular infection makes her shuffle off her mortal coil then that
is the way it is supposed to be.”
(3103-proxy)
Again these conveyed a clear preference for palliative care, rather than life-saving interven-
tions, and a particular abhorrence of severe dependency:
Death and the Oldest Old: Attitudes and Preferences for End-of-Life Care
PLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0150686
April 5, 2016

 “She wouldn’t. . . wish the life support machine to be switched on[. . .] to be resuscitated,
because she’s been saying now for so long that she wants to go. I mean what is there for her?
She’s got nothing, has she?[. . .] Her quality of life is zilch really.”
(1077-proxy)
In a couple of noteworthy instances there was marked contrast between what older people
said and what their relatives thought would be their views. One daughter said “I don’t think
she’d really and truly want to be resuscitated”(1110-proxy), whereas her mother was one of the
minority in favour of active treatment (see 3a) above). Another daughter thought both her
parents would “like treatment to make them comfortable rather than life-saving”(1516+-
1523-proxy), though they hadn’t discussed it, but her mother in fact wanted to “have treatment
as long as [she] could.”(1523).
3e) Discussing end-of-life care preferences.
A few examples were mentioned of how
older people had discussed, or would like to discuss, their end of life preferences. One woman
and her niece wanted the care agency to be “aware of [her] policy decision” that she “would
rather be nursed at home”(3154-proxy), and a wife described how her husband raised his con-
cerns with their GP:
“When Leonard first came back and heard he had this other cancer Dr Warner came to see
him and Leonard said to him ‘Two things I want, please, Andrew, is stay at home and if I’m
in pain, would you try [. . .] if you could keep me out of pain. And I want you to promise me.’
And Andrew Warner was very sweet and he said ‘Leonard, I can’t promise, but I will do my
very best.’”
(3185-proxy)
These discussions were usually with care professionals, but a care home manager com-
mented that it was not necessarily with older people themselves that professionals broached
the topic:
“Historically what happens in hospitals is they tend to. . . if it’s not asked beforehand they go
straight to the relatives. They won’t broach it with the individual, which is actually [. . .]
against the Data Protection Act, and it’s nobody else’s business. But it is how the culture of
hospitals works unfortunately.”
(142-proxy)
However this care home manager pointed out not all her residents wished to have such
discussions:
“Each individual person deals with it differently. Some people do feel that they’ve lived a
decent age and they’re not too worried about it, and other people have a great fear of death
and even in their late nineties would be absolutely terrified. So I think that’s an individual
thing.”
(142-proxy)
She had found that a variety of approaches could be useful:
“I’ve spoken to the GP and we were talking about how we open those conversations, and we
were looking for perhaps some literature, rather than just to say 'Oh well, by the
way. . .'[laughs], because I’m worried because old people may feel that. . . is it a loaded

 question? Is there supposed to be a way they’re supposed to answer because are they a burden
now and all this sort of stuff that sometimes people start feeling. [. . .]We are trying to get it as
a group discussion so they don’t feel it’s something they have to decide on themselves. We
could open it up [. . .]as a general discussion. How do they feel about it? I think it’s the way
forward.”
(142-proxy)
Her long experience pointed to the practical difficulties of having conversations about end-
of-life care preferences:
“I’ve not had long discussions, because of [her] hearing problem [. . .] but I would hope if we
can get this hearing aid sorted that would give her an outlet to join those discussions. It’s very
difficult to write them down on paper [. . .] And she’s got to shout the answer back at you and
you’ve got to re-clarify it.”
(142-proxy)
This experience provided considerable insights into potential pitfalls. The timing of these
conversations was felt to be particularly crucial and often problematic, especially given that
views may change:
“It’s nice to elicit a conversation, but it can be quite scary. I could imagine if I said ‘If I have a
dense stroke tomorrow, leave me’, but then if I had the dense stroke tomorrow I may decide. . .
you know, it is a worry.”
(142-proxy)
Within families it appeared there was very rarely any specific discussion:
“We haven’t discussed it in so many words, but by the way it’s come into conversation here
and there. . . She has talked about upstairs (long-term-care)[. . .] Once I got across to her that
[. . .] it was if you weren’t very well[. . .] you were upstairs [. . .] I think in a way that’s set her
mind at rest that she won’t have to go into hospital.”
(2882-proxy).
One relative commented that the study interview was making her think it was something
she needed to bring up. She felt unsure about how to raise it and who in the family might best
do this: (1150-proxy).
“Maybe something happening to someone else will trigger that conversation.[. . .] His doctor
son could introduce it in relation to his work.[. . .] It’s quite possible that something could hap-
pen. He could have a stroke[. . .] And it would be out of the blue and we would not be pre-
pared necessarily.[. . .] I’ll mention this to Desmond actually. Does he know his dad’s feelings
on this? [. . .]just opened a little door in my own mind.”
(1150-proxy)
3f) Planning and documenting.
If plans for the future were mentioned, it was generally in
the context of not making plans:
Death and the Oldest Old: Attitudes and Preferences for End-of-Life Care
PLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0150686
April 5, 2016
19 / 25
 “I don’t. I just let it come.”
(2952)
“No, I haven’t made any plans, because I’m not ill.”
(3194)
Putting preferences in writing was rarely mentioned. One woman told her daughter that she
should put what she wanted in writing so that if she were “suddenly taken ill and I was very ill,
and the doctor said to you ‘Well, what do you want me to do?’ you’d know what I wanted”. Her
daughter agreed, although she felt this was a “weird [. . .] decision.”(645 & 645-proxy)
‘Living wills’ only came up with one family: the participant’s daughter explained that her
father would never sign a living will:
“He’s talked quite firmly that he would never do that. [. . .] I think it’s the logical, the rational
in him that says. . . [. . .] that people change their mind and he wouldn’t wish to tie himself”
(2930-proxy)
The only example of when specific wishes had been documented was in a care home where:
“We now have it written in her notes that she’s not to go to the district hospital [. . .] and we
have a wonderful little cottage hospital in Easingstoke, with about fourteen, fifteen beds which
everybody longs to go to. You know, it is just super [. . .] lovely reputation.”
(2999-proxy)
However, these recorded wishes had then been overlooked by agency nursing staff who
called an ambulance when concerned about the resident’s condition one night.
Discussion, Implications and Conclusions
We sought thoughts on death and dying and preferences for end-of-life care with a representa-
tive sample of very old people, their relatives and formal carers. This rare dataset of qualitative
interviews described �95-year-olds’ lives as contextualised by death, with the majority wonder-
ing why they were still there and a minority celebrating their survival. Death was now a part of
life for these very old people who were mainly living day-to-day. Most were ready to die,
reflecting their concerns for quality of life, not being a nuisance, having nothing to live for and
feelings of having lived long enough. Contrasting views were rare exceptions but voiced firmly.
Unwanted medical prolongation of life was an issue for some and mention of euthanasia
related to loss of quality of life, usually raised by proxy informants for whom legal implications
were a concern. Most were not worried about death itself. Concerns, coloured by experience of
others’ dying, were more about impact on those left behind and the dying process; a peaceful
and pain-free death, preferably during sleep, was a common ideal. The wide variation in atti-
tudes ranged from not wanting to think about death, through accepting it as inevitable and
approaching, to welcoming or even longing for its release. Preferring to be made comfortable
rather than have life-saving treatment if seriously ill, and wishing to avoid going into hospital,
were both commonly expressed views, again with a few firm exceptions. Some stressed choices
would be affected by circumstances, such as likelihood of severe dependency. They fatalistically
accepted decisions might well be taken by others, family and healthcare professionals, and trust
in decision-makers was important. Some felt their destiny lay with God or fate. Uncertainty
hampered end-of-life planning even when death was expected soon. There was little or no
planning for the future, some consciously choosing not to. Written documentation of wishes

 was virtually unheard of, except sometimes for funerals or wills; the only mention of living
wills was in relation to a reluctance to prepare one, and the only example we came across of an
advance care plan, in nursing home notes, had been ignored. Despite a notable willingness to
discuss end-of-life preferences in most interviews, and death being so ubiquitous, previously
having talked openly about death was uncommon, often only alluded to or couched in humour.
Not all the older people wanted to have such discussions; for the minority who had, these
explicit discussions had usually been with care professionals. Families and care professionals
found these issues hard to raise, generally saying preferences had never been discussed. They
felt they knew their older relatives well enough to predict their preferences, usually palliative
care, mirroring what most older participants wanted, although we found two discrepant views.
Rarely are the views of the very old heard. Our sizeable qualitative dataset uniquely evi-
dences the perspectives of a representative sample of over-95-year-olds. In contrast to much
qualitative research that aims to capture diversity through purposive sampling, these were pop-
ulation-based cohort participants and moreover were well-characterised by the mixed methods
CC75C study’s quantitative epidemiology. Although a single-centre study, sample characteris-
tics are in line with national data available for this age-group and other developed countries.
Non-response potentially limits research validity, but 79% of the surviving cohort were inter-
viewed in person and proxy interviews maximised participation to 92%, ensuring people across
the cognitive and health spectrum were included. Proxy informants frequently quoted partici-
pants themselves, but there are inevitable uncertainties regarding the validity of perspectives
heard second-hand. Reliance on informants to represent older relatives’ preferences, as we
found most could, is not only a research issue; the occasional discrepant views we found have
implications for practice, highlighted in other studies too.[22–24] However, including these
reported views, despite the limitations of proxy reporting, ensured we captured some of the
voices of those least able to express themselves. A further limitation was the study’s inability to
explore how very old peoples’ views might change over time, particularly as they neared death,
a question of importance given their unpredictable circumstances that merits further research.
Our study adds to the few studies to date that have sought the views of older people them-
selves,[9–19;24] rather than just through relatives.[4–8] Although previous research generally
interviewed younger old people, we found overlapping themes, also highlighted in the few rele-
vant reviews.[2;3;10] Heterogeneity of views is unsurprising,[2;3;25;26] but some common
themes are striking: even in their late 90s or beyond our participants generally conveyed a ‘liv-
ing for today’ approach previously reported[2;12–14;27] and comfortable acceptance of death.
[2;3;26] Others too have found a readiness to talk about dying and end-of-life care,[2;3;11;16]
though this rarely happened,[2;12] and willingness to make plans was less clear-cut[3;16;28]:
one UK study found people living alone in their 80s “wanting to prepare for and to have a
choice with regard to where and when they might die”,[15] but a US study found housebound
older people were reluctant to plan for serious illness or dying, especially resisting decision-
making on hypothetical future dilemmas, preferring to wait till they “cross that bridge”.[14]
Other studies of people with dementia and their family carers have also reported the perceived
difficulty of making formal plans for unknown futures.[24;27] Other researchers found, as we
did, a minority who preferred not to discuss dying at all[3;14] and an expectation by some that
others might make decisions when necessary.[3;11;12] As in our study, generally people were
more likely to plan for death—funerals or wills—than dying,[2;11;14] although only a minority
worried about death itself, most were more likely worried about the manner of dying.[15;19]
Our study found that an over-whelming majority of our very old sample had strong prefer-
ences for palliative care–“being made comfortable”–versus “life-saving treatment”. Others have
also reported a majority preferring not to have interventions[11] and found preferences for
life-sustaining treatment declined with decreasing physical or psychological functioning.[29]

 Some questioned the value of intervention: “Why are we being kept alive?”[18] Although only
a minority wanted life-saving treatment, these were strong preferences but had not been com-
municated. Although current policy encourages early discussion and documentation of end-
of-life care preferences,[30–32] our study and others illustrate how multiple barriers to advance
care planning[3;8;24;33;34] apply also to other relevant options rarely discussed, such as mov-
ing into long-term care,[35] not least how unpredictability and changing contexts may change
choices.[9;11;14;23;29;36–40] Others have given thoughtful consideration to the need to recog-
nise that more dying people are following longer frailty trajectories and the implications for
care services.[6;16;26;41;42] Previous research has highlighted challenges of improving com-
munication about preferences[7;25;26;34;40;41;43–46]; we noted with interest other research-
ers’ comments that participants welcomed interviews as an opportunity to express thoughts,
[11] as did many of ours. We found questions on specific topics could open up dialogue with
people hesitant to discuss dying in general. Interviewees themselves suggested that “being sur-
rounded by death” provided opportunities to start conversations, and both family and profes-
sional carers admitted being hesitant to broach the matter, at times leaving an older person
with concerns and information needs, for instance pain relief, that no-one addressed.
We and others have described the complex transitions often experienced by very old people
approaching the end of life,[38;47–52] and there is widespread recognition that transfers
between care settings may be detrimental.[42;53–55] Most of our participants viewed the pros-
pect of hospital negatively, but supporting older people to achieve current preferences in
changing circumstances is a major challenge for research and practice. Prognostication uncer-
tainties in frailty trajectories make determining when hospital admission is ‘inappropriate’
challenging, and too much ‘admissions avoidance’ risks denying very old people diagnosis,
treatment and care that may be entirely appropriate.[38;42;56] Half of UK deaths aged �85 are
in hospitals and a third in care homes[53] so improving end-of-life care for very old people in
all settings is a priority.[7;30;41;42;54;57–60] Prospective population-based research with older
old people, and their informal and formal carers, examining determinants of staying-in-place
or transitions is needed to understand what would enable older people to die in the place and
with the support they would choose.
