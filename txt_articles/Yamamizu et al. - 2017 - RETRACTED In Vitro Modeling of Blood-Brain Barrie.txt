SUMMARY
The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is composed of four cell populations, brain endothelial cells (BECs), pericytes, neurons, and astrocytes. Its
role is to precisely regulate the microenvironment of the brain through selective substance crossing. Here we generated an in vitro model
of the BBB by differentiating human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) into all four populations. When the four hiPSC-derived pop-
ulations were co-cultured, endothelial cells (ECs) were endowed with features consistent with BECs, including a high expression of
nutrient transporters (CAT3, MFSD2A) and efflux transporters (ABCA1, BCRP, PGP, MRP5), and strong barrier function based on tight junc-
tions. Neuron-derived Dll1, which activates Notch signaling in ECs, was essential for the BEC specification. We performed in vitro BBB
permeability tests and assessed ten clinical drugs by nanoLC-MS/MS, finding a good correlation with the BBB permeability reported in
previous cases. This technology should be useful for research on human BBB physiology, pathology, and drug development.
INTRODUCTION
The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is composed of specialized
brain endothelial cells (BECs) that are surrounded by peri-
cytes, astrocytes, and neurons. These neurovascular units
form intracellular tight junctions between BECs, which
limit the passive diffusion of molecules into the CNS.
BECs are enriched with nutrient transporters, such as
glucose transporters, amino acid transporters, and fatty
acid transporters, for efficient uptake into the brain from
the blood. On the other hand, the enrichment of polarized
efflux transporters, such as P-glycoprotein (PGP), breast
cancer resistance protein (BCRP), and multidrug resis-
tance-associated proteins (MRPs) in BECs protects the brain
from toxic factors and pathogens. Because of drug efflux
by the BBB, the delivery of therapeutic drugs into the
brain to treat CNS diseases has been a major challenge.
The BBB is also associated with brain disease, as its impair-
ment correlates with neurodegenerative diseases including
Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease (Desai et al.,
2007; Saito and Ihara, 2014). These reasons have spurred re-
searchers to establish a BBB model for analyzing the
dysfunction of neurovascular units and drug permeability
in vitro.
Current in vitro BBB models use brain microvessels and
astrocytes isolated from non-human species such as pig,
rat, or mouse (Deli et al., 2005). However, the characteris-
tics and functions of the BBB from these species differ
from that in humans (Aday et al., 2016; Hoshi et al.,
2013; Syva
¨nen et al., 2009; Warren et al., 2009). Therefore,
a human-derived BBB model is needed for pre-clinical drug
screening or research about human BBB physiology and
pathology. Although human primary brain microvessels
isolated from the brain specimens of tumors or epilepsy
patients can be used, they have low availability and repro-
ductivity (Cecchelli et al., 2007). Immortalized human
brain microvessels have also been considered, but the re-
sulting BBB models do not form strong barrier properties
due to discontinuous tight junctions (Weksler et al.,
2005). Endothelial cells (ECs) derived from human induced
pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) have been used to prepare
human in vitro BBB models, but these cells must be co-
cultured with primary rat astrocytes or C6 rat glioma cells
for maturation of the BBB (Lippmann et al., 2012; Minami
et al., 2015). In the present work, we sought to induce all
four BBB components, ECs, pericytes, neurons, and astro-
cytes, from hiPSCs, which are an unlimited human source
and recapitulate development, in order to create a repro-
ducible and robust human BBB model.
In our protocol, we developed a hiPSC differentiation
system to produce ECs that depends on cyclic AMP
(cAMP). cAMP is crucial for enhancing the EC differentia-
tion and arterial specification of mouse embryonic stem
cells (Yamamizu et al., 2009, 2010, 2012a, 2012b). To
generate BECs, we co-cultured the ECs with pericytes,
neurons, and astrocytes, which were also derived from
hiPSCs. Culturally induced BECs (ciBECs) showed proper-
ties consistent of the BBB, including an enrichment of
BBB-specific transporters, good barrier function, and the
efflux of drugs. This method allowed us to investigate the

 mechanisms of BBB formation, which led to our discovery
that ciBEC specification occurs through Notch signaling
via Dll1 in neurons. Our model should be useful for the
study of BBB development and homeostasis, and also for
the discovery of CNS drugs that bypass the BBB.
RESULTS
Differentiation of hiPSCs into ECs, Pericytes, Neurons,
and Astrocytes
We first addressed the creation of an efficient EC and peri-
cyte differentiation system derived from hiPSCs. We previ-
ously reported that the cAMP/protein kinase A/CREB
pathway triggers the initiation of endothelial and hemato-
poietic cell differentiation via Etv2 induction (Yamamizu
et al., 2009, 2012a, 2012b). Therefore, we treated cells
from primitive mesoderm stage with cAMP and vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) based on our cardio-
myocyte differentiation method (Masumoto et al., 2014)
(Figure 1A). VEGF receptor type 2 (KDR)-positive and
platelet-derived growth factor receptor a (PDGFRa)-positive
cells appeared in approximately 70% of the cells at 4 days
after differentiation. KDR single-positive cells and KDR/
PDGFRa double-positive cells appeared after treatment
with cAMP and VEGF, and KDR-positive cells were purified
by auto MACS at day 5 after the differentiation and then
recultured (Figure 1B). At day 9 after differentiation, the
percentage of CD31/VE-CADHERIN double-positive ECs
was nearly 99%, and these cells showed spindle-like struc-
tures (Figures 1C and 1D). All ECs took up low-density lipo-
protein (LDL) into thecytoplasm, indicating functionalECs
(Figure 1E). At day 12 after differentiation, the percentage of
CD31-positive ECs was about 91% and PDGFRb-positive
pericytes about 7% (Figure 1F). The PDGFRb+/CD31� peri-
cytes were purified by fluorescence-activated cell sorting
(FACS) and positive for a-smooth muscle actin (aSMA),
SM22a, NG2, and CALPONIN (Figure 1G). We examined
the function of these ECs by using the tube formation assay.
The ECs generated vascular-like structures on Matrigel. Gel
immunostaining showed that these structures consisted of
CD31-positive ECs attached to aSMA-positive pericytes
(Figure 1H).
We next induced astrocytes and neurons from hiPSCs.
We established a differentiation method by modifying pre-
vious procedures (Kondo et al., 2013) (Figure 1I). After
plating embryoid bodies, almost all differentiated cells
were positive for NESTIN, a neural progenitor marker,
and some cell populations started to differentiate into class
III b-tubulin (TUJ1)-positive neurons at stage 2 (Figure 1J).
TUJ1-positive neurons were dramatically induced by
changing the medium at stage 3 (Figure 1K). Glial fibrillary
acidic protein (GFAP)-positive astrocytes were increased
after neural maturation at stage 4, which was followed by
brain development in vivo (Figure 1L). An astrocyte-enrich-
ment culture showed a high population of GFAP-positive
astrocytes at stage 5 (Figure 1M). qPCR clearly showed the
induction of the neural progenitor marker Pax6 at stage
2, the mature neuron marker MAP2 at stage 3, and the
astrocyte marker GFAP at stages 4 and 5 (Figure 1N). Taken
together, our two systems efficiently differentiated hiPSCs
into the four BBB components.
Generation of ciBECs with Four Cell Populations
Derived from hiPSCs
The BBB is composed of specialized BECs surrounded by
pericytes, astrocytes, and neurons. Thus, we hypothesized
that BECs are generated by cell-cell interactions with the
other three lineages and created a co-culture system with
the four cell populations derived from hiPSCs described
above. Astrocytes and neurons from 90 to 120 days after
differentiation were recultured on differentiated cells
with the EC and pericyte differentiation system at day 7
after differentiation (Figure 2A). Immunostaining showed
that TUJ1-positive neurons and GFAP-positive astrocytes

 were approximately 40% and 45% of the total population
from 90 to 120 days after differentiation (Figure S1A). The
endfeet of astrocytes elongated to the ECs, while neurons
also interacted with ECs during the co-culture (Figures 2B
and 2C). After co-culture with the four lineages derived
from hiPSCs for 5 days, we purified ciBECs by FACS and
analyzed their properties. Notably, 21 of the 22 BBB
transporters and receptors analyzed in this study tended
to have higher expressions in ciBECs compared with
normal ECs, which were not co-cultured with astrocytes
and neurons. Of the BBB-specific transporters analyzed,
six, including cationic amino acid transporter 3 (CAT3),
MFSD2A, which is a transporter for the essential u-3 fatty
acid docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and the polarized efflux
transporters, ATP-binding cassette transporters ABCA1,
BCRP, PGP, and MRP5, were significantly increased in
ciBECs (Figure 2D). We compared the properties of the
ciBECs with those of the immortalized brain microvascular
endothelial cell line, hCMEC/D3, and human umbilical
vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). The expressions of CAT1,
PGP, and Transferrin receptor in ciBECs and hCMEC/D3 are
similar. However, the expressions of efflux transporters
such as ABCA1, BCRP, and MRP5 are higher in ciBECs
than in hCMEC/D3 and HUVEC (Figure 2D). Immuno-
staining further showed that BCRP and PGP were highly
expressed in ciBECs compared with ECs (Figure 2E). We
next examined how these expressions changed with the
culture. The co-culture of neurons (stage 3 in Figure 1I)
with ECs and pericytes partially increased BBB-specific
transporters and receptors. In contrast, co-culture of astro-
cytes (stage 5 in Figure 1I) with ECs and pericytes did not
lead to an increase. Importantly, the co-culture of both
neurons and astrocytes with ECs and pericytes was most
efficient at inducing BBB-specific transporters and recep-
tors (Figure S2). These results indicated that cell-cell
communication between ECs and neurons and astrocytes
is crucial in acquiring ciBEC properties.
We induced ciBECs with two hiPSC lines, 201B6 and
836B3. Furthermore, we performed the chimera differenti-
ation assay, in which 836B3 iPSC-derived ECs and pericytes
were co-cultured with 201B6 iPSC-derived neurons and
astrocytes. This method also was able to generate ciBECs
(Figure S3). These results indicated that our method is
robust for generating ciBECs.

 Induction of ciBECs via Notch Activation by Dll1 in
Neurons
Our ciBEC generation method is amenable to investigating
the underlying mechanisms of ciBEC specification. We
first attempted to investigate the mechanisms of ciBEC
specification by a pharmacological approach. We treated
the cells with six inhibitors that are associated with
various signaling pathways, such as Notch signaling and
Wnt signaling, from the beginning of the co-culture of
ECs, pericytes, astrocytes, and neurons. Interestingly,
treatment with DAPT (N-[N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl)-L-
alanyl]-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester), a g-secretase in-
hibitor which prevents Notch signaling, inhibited the up-
regulation of BBB-specific transporters in ECs co-cultured
with
astrocytes
and
neurons
(Figure
3A).
Similarly,
LY294002, a phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor, specif-
ically inhibited the upregulation of BCRP in the co-culture
system. Wnt inhibitors, including XAV939 and IWP4, did
not have significant effects on the expression of BBB trans-
porters (Figure 3A). We next examined Notch activation in
ciBECs by immunostaining for Notch intracellular domain
(NICD). NICD was highly expressed in the nuclei of ciBECs
compared with ECs, and this localization was prevented by
DAPT treatment (Figure 3B). These results suggested that
Notch signaling is involved in ciBEC generation.
To investigate which cells activate Notch signaling in
ciBECs, we examined the expression levels of Notch
receptors and ligands in ECs, pericytes, astrocytes, and
neurons. We first purified CD31+/PDGFRb� ECs and
PDGFRb+/CD31� pericytes at 12 days after differentia-
tion and collected CD44+/PSA�NCAM� astrocytes and
PSA�NCAM+/CD44�neurons from 90 to 120 days after

 differentiation by FACS (Figures 1B and S1C). We checked
lineage-specific gene expressions by qPCR. CD31, SM22a,
MAP2, and GFAP were highly expressed in ECs, pericytes,
neurons, and astrocytes, respectively (Figure 4A). Next,
we investigated mRNA expressions of Notch receptors
and ligands in the four lineages. Notch1 and 4 were
highly expressed in ECs and Notch2 and 3 were enriched
in astrocytes. Notch ligands, Dll4 and Jagged2, were
highly expressed in ECs and Jagged1 was enriched in
pericytes. We focused on Dll1, which was highly ex-
pressed in neurons, to analyze the generation of ciBECs
(Figure 4B).
To define the biological effect of the high Dll1 expres-
sion, we performed a loss-of-function study using Dll1
small interfering RNA (siRNA) (siDll1). Approximately
81% inhibition of Dll1 mRNA expression in neurons and
astrocytes at 120 days after differentiation was induced
with the transfection of siDll1#2 (Figure S4A). We co-
cultured the siRNA-treated neurons and astrocytes (siDll1
or control siRNA [siCon]) on ECs and pericytes for 5 days.
siCon-treated neurons and astrocytes significantly induced
the six BBB-specific transporters compared with ECs. siDll1
treatment tended to inhibit the six BBB-specific trans-
porters and resulted in significant inhibition of ABCA1,
MFSD2A, BCRP, and MRP5 compared with siCon treatment
(Figure 4C). Taken together, these results indicated that
Dll1 in neurons is crucial for the generation of ciBECs by
activating Notch signaling.
BBB Model Using ciBECs Derived from hiPSCs
To create a BBB model with hiPSC-derived ciBECs, we
seeded ciBECs purified from the co-culture with pericytes,
neurons, and astrocytes by FACS onto Transwell filters
coated with fibronectin and grew them to confluence
for 7 days (Figure 5A). Immunostaining of ZO-1 and
CLAUDIN5 showed the maintenance of continuous cell-
cell contacts between ciBECs on the Transwell filter (Fig-
ure 5B). Western blotting with membrane protein showed
that CLAUDIN5 was highly expressed in ciBECs compared
with ECs (Figure S4B). A hallmark of the BBB is high
transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) due to tight
junctions between ciBECs. As expected, ciBECs showed
a
significant
increase
of
TEER
compared
with
ECs.
When we co-cultured the cells with astrocytes from days
125–180 after differentiation on the bottom side of the
Transwell, the TEER of ciBECs, but not of ECs, was dra-
matically enhanced (Figure 5C), indicating ciBECs had a
brain-like phenotype. To confirm the existence of tight
junctions between ciBECs, we analyzed the cells by trans-
mission electron microscopy. ciBECs co-cultured with as-
trocytes clearly formed tight junctions (Figure 5D). To
further validate the barrier function in our iPSC-derived
BBB model, we investigated the permeability of fluores-
cein-Na (FN, 376 Da) and fluorescein isothiocyanate
(FITC)-dextran of different masses (4, 10, 20, 40, and
70 kDa), which cross the BBB non-specifically by paracellu-
lar diffusion. ciBECs showed significantly decreased perme-
ability of FN (39.3% ± 3.8%) and 4-kDa FITC-dextran
(26.1% ± 5.6%) compared with ECs, hCMEC/D3, and
HUVEC (Figures 5E and S6). Heavier FITC-dextran also
tended to have less permeability across ciBECs compared
with ECs (Figure 5E). Taken together, hiPSC-derived ciBECs
have a strong barrier function, including high transendo-
thelial resistance and low rates of paracellular leakage.
Screening System of Drug Permeability with BBB
Model
We found that the induced ciBECs highly expressed polar-
ized efflux transporters, such as PGP, BCRP, and MRPs. To
define the biological function of these high expressions,
we first examined PGP function using rhodamine-123, a
cell-permeable PGP substrate. ECs and HUVEC showed
about 1.2-fold increase and hCMEC/D3 about 2-fold in-
crease in rhodamine-123 accumulation in the presence of
verapamil, a PGP inhibitor. Notably, cell accumulation of
rhodamine-123 in ciBECs was significantly increased
approximately 2.5-fold with verapamil, demonstrating
the functional PGP efflux activity of ciBECs (Figures 6A
and S5A–S5C).
Finally, we screened the BBB permeability for small mol-
ecules of clinical drugs by nano liquid chromatography-
tandem mass spectrometry (nanoLC-MS/MS) using our
hiPSC-derived BBB model. We selected ten drugs with
known permeability properties for the evaluation. Notably,
propranolol, caffeine, antipyrin, carbamazepine, and trazo-
done, which can all cross the BBB into the CNS by lipid-
mediated free diffusion (indicated as CNS-positive drugs
in Figure 6C), displayed high permeability coefficient
values (Pe) (144.8 ± 26.3 to 879.4 ± 161.1 3 10�6 cm/s).
In contrast, sulpiride, epinastine, cimetidine, quinidine,
and prazosine, which have low BBB permeability as efflux
transporter substrates (indicated as CNS-negative drugs in
Figure 6C), showed low Pe (5.9 ± 2.6 to 53.2 ± 22.8 3
10�6 cm/s) (Figures 6B and 6C). These results indicated

 that our human iPSC-derived BBB model could be used to
predict the permeability of developmental drugs.
We also investigated DHA permeability for analyzing the
function of the nutrient transporter in our BBB model. An
analysis of DHA kinetics with nanoLC-MS/MS showed that
ciBECs significantly increased the permeability of DHA
compared with ECs (Figure S5D). This result suggested
that nutrient transporters such as MFSD2A in hiPSC-
derived ciBECs are functional in the BBB model.
DISCUSSION
Understanding how the BBB operates is crucial for drug
development, as it impedes chemical molecules from
reaching the CNS. Current non-primate BBB models fail
to adequately recapitulate human BBB function because
of species-specific differences (Aday et al., 2016; Hoshi
et al., 2013; Syva
¨nen et al., 2009; Warren et al., 2009). We
therefore considered human iPSCs as a resource for creating
a reproducible and robust human BBB model. Here, we
generated hiPSC-derived BBB that expressed specific trans-
porters and receptors and showed low permeability proper-
ties, suggesting that it could be used as a platform for initial
drug screening before in vivo clinical tests.
Importantly, using simple co-culturing systems with
hiPSC-derived ECs, pericytes, neurons, and astrocytes, we
revealed a molecular mechanism for ciBEC specification.
In particular, this technology allows us to investigate cell-
cell interactions,whichledto thediscovery that Dll1 expres-
sion by neurons is crucial for activating the Notch signaling
that leads to ciBEC specificity. Notch is a single-pass trans-
membrane receptor known for its function in controlling
cell-fate decisions and creating boundaries through cell-
cell communication. Notch signaling in ECs is known to
specify arterial ECs (Yamamizu et al., 2010). Dll1, a Notch
ligand in neurons, functions in neural differentiation and
maintenance (Grandbarbe et al., 2003; Kageyama et al.,
2008). Furthermore, it communicates with radial glial cells
for the differentiation to astrocytes (Namihira et al., 2009).
Our results showed that Dll1 was highly expressed in
mature neurons (Figure S6A), and we demonstrated that it

 interacted with ECs for ciBEC specification (Figure 4C).
Some reports have shown that the Wnt canonical pathway
is crucial for proper neurovascular development. For
example, the simultaneous ablation of Wnt7a/7b is embry-
onic lethal for neurovascular phenotypes (Daneman et al.,
2009; Stenman et al., 2008). Our results showed that
Wnt7a was expressed in neurons and Wnt7b was expressed
in pericytes and astrocytes (Figure S6B), but treatment
with Wnt inhibitors in our co-culture system did not cause
significant differences in the expression of BBB-specific
transporters (Figure 3A). Moreover, we found that Wnt7a
was highly expressed in early-stage neural progenitors (Fig-
ure S6C), indicating that Wnt7a may be necessary for early
vascularization in the brain. Overall, our technology could
help elucidate the underlying molecular machinery for
finely regulated BBB formation, which should offer new
therapeutic strategies to repair the BBB following stroke or
other neurological impairments.
The brain vasculature sprouts into the neuronal tube and
elongates toward the ventricular zone to form vascular net-
works that are surrounded by neuroepithelial cells, radial
glia, neuroblasts, and neurons at around embryonic day
9.5(E9.5)inmouseembryo (Engelhardt,2003).The vascular
permeability decreases at E16 as it interacts with BECs,
neurons, and radial glial cells (Risau et al., 1986). Our ciBEC
specification process seems to involve Notch signaling in
response to neuron-derived Dll1 (Figure 4C), which may
recapitulate the in vivo microenvironment for BBB develop-
ment. We found that mature barrier characteristics of
the BBB were induced by crosstalk between iPSC-derived as-
trocytes (Figure 5C). Several astrocytic factors for BBB matu-
ration, including transforming growth factor, glial cell-
derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), basic fibroblast growth
factor (bFGF), interleukin-6, angiopoietin-1 (Ang1), and hy-
drocortisone, are capable of glial-mediated barrier induction
(Abbott, 2002; Lee et al., 2003). Indeed, hiPSC-derived astro-
cytes highly expressed GDNF, bFGF, EGF (epidermal growth
factor), and Ang1 (Figure S6D). Further analyses are needed
to identify the BBB maturation factors from hiPSC-derived
astrocytes. In addition, previous anatomical examination
of the brain microvasculature showed that the endfeet of as-
trocytes form a lacework of fine lamellae to closely support
the outer surfaces of the endothelium (Kacem et al., 1998).
Althoughwesuccessfullyused Transwelldishes, whichsepa-
rate the apical and basolateral sides, to analyze drug kinetics,
the construction of a three-dimensional BBB model from all
four cell populations will expedite mature BBB formation
and BBB physiology analysis.

 Thewidespreadhopefora new eraofprevention and treat-
ment for chronic neurological disorders, such as stroke,
Alzheimer’s disease, and Parkinson’s disease, will likely
depend on the discovery of new CNS drugs. However,
currently over 99% of candidate CNS drugs fail in clinical
tests because of side effects and/or an inability to cross the
BBB (Alavijeh et al., 2005). Our human iPSC-derived BBB
shows promise as a model for CNS drug development at
the pre-clinical stage. BBB models constructed from CNS dis-
ease patient-specific iPSCs should also provide new insights
into how vascular dysfunction contributes to CNS diseases.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Differentiation of hiPSCs into ECs and Pericytes
We used the human iPSC lines 201B6 and 836B3 (Takahashi et al.,
2007). The methods for culturing and passaging human iPSCs were
reported previously (Masumoto et al., 2014). hCMEC/D3 (Milli-
pore) was cultured with EGM2 (Lonza) and 5% fetal bovine serum
(FBS) (Life Technologies). HUVEC (Lonza) was cultured with EGM2
(Lonza).
For EC and pericyte differentiation, iPSCs were detached with
Versene (0.48 mM EDTA solution; Life Technologies) and plated
onto Matrigel (growth factor reduced, 1:60 dilution; Life Technol-
ogies)-coated plates at a density of approximately 70,000 cells/cm2
in mouse embryonic fibroblast conditioned medium (MEF-CM;
DMEM [Nacalai Tesque]) containing 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mM
L-glutamine, and 1% non-essential amino acids (NEAA) (Life
Technologies) with 4 ng/mL bFGF (Wako Pure Chemicals Indus-
tries) for 2 days before induction. Cells were covered with Matrigel
(1:60 dilution) 1 day before induction. MEF-CM was replaced
with RPMI + B27 medium (RPMI-1640, 2 mM L-glutamine, B27
supplement without insulin) supplemented with 100 ng/mL of
activin A (R&D Systems) for 1 day, followed by 10 ng/mL bone
morphogenetic protein 4 (R&D), 10 ng/mL bFGF, and Matrigel
(1:60 dilution) for 3 days without culture medium change. After
differentiation at 4 days, the culture medium was replaced with
RPMI + B27 medium with 100 ng/mL VEGF165 (Wako) and
1 mM 8-bromoadenosine-30,50-cyclic monophosphate sodium
salt (8-bromo-cAMP) (Nacalai Tesque) for 1 day. Primitive meso-
derm cells were purified with autoMACS (Miltenyi Biotec) using
anti-KDR antibody and anti-APC MicroBeads (Miltenyi Biotec)
and recultured at a density of 60,000 cells/cm2 with RPMI + B27
medium, 100 ng/mL VEGF165, and 1 mM 8-bromo-cAMP. One
day after MACS sorting, the culture medium was replaced with
RPMI + B27 medium and 100 ng/mL VEGF165. Then ECs were
cultured with human endothelial serum-free medium (SFM) (Life
Technologies)
supplemented
with
20
ng/mL
bFGF (Wako),
10 ng/mL EGF (Life Technologies), and 10 mg/mL human plasma
fibronectin (Life Technologies), and refreshed every 3 days.
Differentiation of hiPSCs into Astrocytes and Neurons
iPSCs were dissociated to single cells and quickly reaggregated
in U-bottomed 96-well plates (Greiner Bio-One) pre-coated with
2% Pluronic F-127 (Sigma-Aldrich) for embryoid body (EB) forma-
tion. EBs were cultured in DMEM/Ham’s F12 (Life Technologies)
supplemented with 5% knockout serum replacement, 2 mM
L-glutamine, 1% NEAA, 0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol (Life Technol-
ogies), 2 mM dorsomorphin, and 10 mM SB431542 (Wako) at stage 1
of the neural induction (days 0–8). EBs were transferred onto
Matrigel (1:60 dilution)-coated 6-well plates and cultured in
DMEM/Ham’s F12 supplemented with N2 supplement (Life Tech-
nologies) and 2 mM dorsomorphin (Wako) at stage 2 (days 8–24).
At 24 days after differentiation, neural precursor cells were cultured
in Neurobasal Medium (Life Technologies) supplemented with
B27 without vitamin A, Glutamax, 10 ng/mL brain-derived neuro-
trophic factor, 10 ng/mL GDNF, and 10 ng/mL NT3 on Matrigel-
coated 10 cm dishes and refreshed every 3 days at stage 3 (days
24–60). Cells at 60 days after differentiation were transferred
onto Matrigel (1:60 dilution)-coated 10-cm dishes and cultured
in
DMEM/Ham’s
F12
supplemented
with
N2
supplement
(Life Technologies) and refreshed every 3 days at stage 4 (days
60–120). Cells at 120 days after differentiation were passaged on
non-coated polystyrene 10-cm dishes for astrocyte culture, because
neurons weakly attach to non-coated polystyrene 10-cm dishes
whereas astrocytes attach strongly and proliferate. By repeated pas-
sage in the same manner at days 140, 160, and 180, astrocytes
increased their own abundance ratio and showed positive GFAP
immunostaining (more than 80%) at stage 5 (days 120–180).
Induction of ciBECs
BECs were induced by having ECs interact with pericytes, astro-
cytes, and neurons. To promote this interaction, we prepared a
co-culture system with hiPSCs-derived ECs, pericytes, astrocytes,
and neurons. Astrocytes and neurons (total 3.5 3 106 cells) from
day 90 to day 120 after differentiation were co-cultured on differ-
entiated ECs and pericytes (about 3.5 3 106 cells) at day 7 in SFM
(Life Technologies) supplemented with 20 ng/mL bFGF (Wako),
10 ng/mL EGF (Life Technologies), and 10 mg/mL human plasma
fibronectin (Life Technologies) for 5 days. The population of the
co-culture at day 7 included about 49.5% CD31-positive ECs,
0.5% PDGFRb-positive pericytes, 20% TUJ1-positive neurons,
and 22.5% GFAP-positive astrocytes. We refreshed the medium
every 3 days. The population of the co-culture at day 12 included
approximately 10% CD31-positive ECs, 5% PDGFRb-positive peri-
cytes, 20% TUJ1-positive neurons, and 45% GFAP-positive astro-
cytes (Figures 1 and S1). ciBECs and ECs were purified with FACS
AriaII (Becton Dickinson) using anti-CD31 (PECAM1) conjugated
with APC at 12 days after differentiation. The ciBECs were used
to form the BBB model.
Immunostaining and FACS Analysis
Immunostaining of the cultured cells was carried out as described
previously (Yamamizu et al., 2012a, 2010). In brief, 4% paraformal-
dehyde-fixed cells were blocked by 1% skim milk (BD Biosciences)
and incubated overnight with primary antibodies at 4�C. For
immunofluorescence staining, anti-mouse, rat, rabbit, or goat
immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies conjugated with Alexa 488
or Alexa 546 (Life Technologies) were used as secondary anti-
bodies. Nuclei were visualized with DAPI (Life Technologies).
Stained cells were photographed with the inverted fluorescence
microscope BZ-9000 (Keyence) or Eclipse TE2000-U (Nikon) and
a digital camera system (AxioCam HRc, Carl Zeiss) with the use
Stem Cell Reports j Vol. 8 j 634–647 j March 14, 2017
643
 of AxioVision 4.7.1 Software (Carl Zeiss). The following primary
antibodies were used for immunostaining: anti-mouse CD31 anti-
body (BBA7; R&D; 1:1,000), anti-rabbit CD31 antibody (ab134168;
Abcam; 1:1,000), anti-VE-CADHERIN antibody conjugated with
phycoerythrin (PE) (12-1449-80; BD Biosciences; 1:200), anti-
aSMA antibody (A2547; Sigma-Aldrich; 1:1,000), anti-SM22a
antibody (ab10135; Abcam; 1:500), anti-CALPONIN (ab46794;
Abcam; 1:500), anti-NG2 (14-6504-80; eBioscience; 1:500), anti-
NESTIN antibody (MAB5326; Millipore; 1:500), anti-mouse TUJ1
antibody (MAB1637; Millipore; 1:1,000), anti-rabbit TUJ1 anti-
body (845501; Covance; 1:1,000), anti-GFAP antibody (IS524;
Dako; 1:100), anti-BCRP antibody (MAB995; R&D; 1:200), anti-
PGP antibody (MA1-26528; Thermo Fisher; 1:200), anti-NICD
antibody (ab52301; Abcam; 1:300), anti-CLAUDIN5 antibody
(352500; Life Technologies; 1:500), and anti-ZO1 antibody
(339100; Novex; 1:500).
For FACS analysis, differentiated cells were stained with combi-
nations of APC-conjugated PDGFRa (FAB1264A; BD Biosciences)
and PE-conjugated KDR (CD309; Miltenyi Biotec), APC-conju-
gated CD31 (17-0319-42; BD Biosciences) and PE-conjugated
PDGFRb (558821; BD Biosciences), or APC-conjugated PSA-
NCAM (130-093-273;
Miltenyi Biotec) and FITC-conjugated
CD44 (338804; BD Biosciences), then subjected to analysis using
FACS AriaII (Becton Dickinson). Negative controls used were
non-staining cells or cells stained with APC-conjugated anti-rabbit
IgG (711-136-152; Jackson ImmunoResearch) and PE-conjugated
anti-mouse IgG (115-116-072; Jackson ImmunoResearch).
Acetylated LDL Uptake Assay and Tube Formation
Assay
LDL uptake assays for ECs were performed as previously reported
(Yamamizu et al., 2013). LDL uptake by cells was assessed by fluo-
rescence microscopy after incubation with 10 mg/mL acetylated
LDL labeled with 1,10-dioctadecyl-3,3,30,30-tetramethylindo-carbo-
cyanine perchlorate (DiI-Ac-LDL) (Biomedical Technologies) for
4 hr at 37�C.
The tube formation assay for ECs was carried out as described pre-
viously (Yamamizu et al., 2013). ECs and pericytes (total 7 3 104) at
12 days after differentiation were cultured in a 24-well plate (Life
Technologies) coated with 150 mL of Matrigel Basement Membrane
Matrix GFR (BD Biosciences).
RNA Isolation and qRT-PCR
Total RNA was isolated from differentiated cells using Qiazol
(Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Reverse
transcription was performed with the SuperScript III first-strand
synthesis system (Life Technologies). qPCR was performed using
Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) and a
StepOnePlus system (Applied Biosystems). The amount of target
RNA was normalized relative to the amount of 18S rRNA mRNA.
Primer sequences are shown in Table S1.
Dll1 Knockdown Using siRNA
siRNA targeting human Dll1 No. 1, 50-ACG GAU CUC GAG AAC
AGC UAC UCC U-30, Dll1 No. 2, 50-CGG ACU CGG GCU GUU
CAA CUU CAA A-30, Dll1 No. 3, 50-CGG GAU GGC GUG AAC
GAC UUC UCC U-30, and negative control Dll1, 50-CCA CAA
GGA UGG GAA CGU CUU AGG A-30 were purchased from Life
Technologies (Stealth RNAi). We checked knockdown efficiencies
of the siRNA and selected siRNA targeting human Dll1 No. 2 (Fig-
ure S2). Stealth RNAi for Dll1 No. 2 (20 nM) or control (20 nM)
were transfected into astrocytes and neurons before 2 days of co-
culture with ECs and pericytes using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX
(Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
After co-culture day 5, differentiated cells were examined by
qPCR and immunohistochemistry.
Generation of BBB Model
Purified CD31-positive ciBECs and ECs were suspended with SFM
medium supplemented with 20 ng/mL bFGF, 10 ng/mL EGF, and
10 mg/mL human plasma fibronectin. A total of 12 3 104 ciBECs
were plated on 500 mg/mL human plasma fibronectin-coated
cell-culture inserts in the 24-well Transwell at 200 mL/well (Costar;
polyester membrane, 0.4 mm pore size). Pre-seeded astrocytes
from D125 to D180 on the bottom side of the culture dish were
switched from DMEM/Ham’s F12 supplemented with N2 supple-
ment into SFM medium supplemented with 20 ng/mL bFGF,
10 ng/mL EGF, and 10 mg/mL human plasma fibronectin, and
the inserts with ciBECs were added. After 3 days the medium was
changed to minimum essential medium (Life Technologies) with
10% FBS (Life Technologies) and 100 ng/mL VEGF (Wako) for
2 days and then changed again to SFM medium supplemented
with 20 ng/mL bFGF, 10 ng/mL EGF, and 10 mg/mL human plasma
fibronectin for 2 days, and were used for further experiments such
as drug kinetics.
Measurement of Transendothelial Electrical
Resistance
Cells were allowed to equilibrate at room temperature from the
cell-culture incubator (37�C, 5% CO2) for 20 min. TEER values
were measured using an EVOM2 voltmeter with STX-2 electrodes
(World Precision Instruments). For calculation of TEER (U [ohms]
3 cm2), electrical resistance across a fibronectin-coated insert
without cells was subtracted from the readings obtained on inserts
with cells and then multiplied by the surface area of the insert
(0.33 cm2).
Transmission Electron Microscopy
ciBECs were cultured onto cell-culture inserts as described above.
ciBECs were washed once with PBS and fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde
(Microscopy Sciences) and 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich)
overnight at 4�C. All sections were treated with OsO4 (1% for
1 min and 0.5% for 20 min at 4�C) in PBS, dehydrated in ethanol
and propylene oxide, and embedded in Luveak 812 (Nacalai Tes-
que). Ultrathin sections were cut with an ultramicrotome (Leica)
and observed with a transmission electron microscope (H-7650;
Hitachi).
Permeability Assay Using Fluorescein-Na/FITC-
Labeled Dextrans
ciBECs were cultured on cell inserts with astrocytes on the bottom
side of Transwell for 7 days. For the transport experiments, all me-
dia were removed from the upper chamber of the inserts and
644
Stem Cell Reports j Vol. 8 j 634–647 j March 14, 2017
 replaced with 50 mL of pre-warmed Hank’s balanced salt solution
(HBSS) (Life Technologies) supplemented with 10 mM HEPES
(Life Technologies) and 0.1% BSA (Sigma-Aldrich) by equilibration
to 37�C for 15 min. At a time point 0 min, 50 mL of 2 mM fluores-
cein-Na or 2 mg/mL FITC-labeled dextran was added to the upper
chamber of the inserts, which were then transferred to 24-well
plates containing 1 mL of pre-warmed HBSS supplemented with
10 mM HEPES. Samples (100 mL) were collected at 15, 30, 45,
and 60 min from the bottom chamber and transferred to a black-
walled 96-well plate (Nunc). The fluorescence was measured with
an Envision fluorescence plate reader (PerkinElmer). Concentra-
tions were calculated using standard curves generated from the
stock solutions of each compound. Permeability coefficients (Pe)
that take into account the barrier to transport from both the endo-
thelial monolayer and the cell-culture insert were calculated as
described previously (Perrie
`re et al., 2005; Nakagawa et al., 2009;
Watson et al., 2013).
PGP Functional Efflux Assay
ciBECs were cultured onto cell-culture inserts as described above.
The media were replaced with HBSS supplemented with 10 mM
HEPES and 0.1% BSA containing either 100 mM verapamil or
vehicle (0.5% DMSO), followed by incubation at 37�C for
30 min. Cells were dye-loaded by removing buffer from the upper
chamber and replacing it with fresh buffer containing 200 ng/mL
rhodamine-123 at 37�C for 30 min. The cells were washed three
times in HBSS supplemented with 10 mM HEPES and 0.1% BSA.
Fresh assay buffer was added onto the cell-culture inserts and incu-
bated at 37�C for 1 hr to allow dye efflux. At the end of the incuba-
tion the inserts were transferred to a fresh plate, and the cells were
washed three times in PBS and lysed for 20 min in cell lysis buffer.
The fluorescence was measured with an Envision fluorescence
plate reader (PerkinElmer). The cellular uptake of rhodamine-123
was calculated using standard curves generated from stock solu-
tions of the dye.
Analysis of Drug Permeability Using NanoLC-MS/MS
Drugs were dissolved in DMSO to a concentration of 1 mM and
further diluted in HBSS supplemented with 10 mM HEPES. ciBECs
were cultured onto cell-culture inserts as described above. We re-
freshed 50 mL of pre-warmed HBSS supplemented with 10 mM
HEPES and 0.1% BSA by equilibration to 37�C for 15 min. At the
time point 0 min, 50 mL of 4 mM drug was added to the upper
chamber of the inserts, which were then transferred to 24-well
plates containing 1 mL of pre-warmed HBSS supplemented
with 10 mM HEPES. Samples were collected from the lower cham-
ber at 10, 20, 30, and 40 min, 15, 30, 45, and 60 min, or 30, 60, 90,
and
120
min.
Samples
were
desalted
with
reversed-phase
StageTips (Rappsilber et al., 2007) and suspended in loading buffer
(0.5% trifluoroacetic acid and 4% acetonitrile) for subsequent
nanoLC-MS/MS analysis.
NanoLC-MS/MS was performed using a TripleTOF 5600 system
(AB Sciex) equipped with an HTC-PAL autosampler (CTC Ana-
lytics). Loaded samples were separated on a self-pulled analytical
column (150 mm length, 100 mm internal diameter) using a Dio-
nex Ultimate 3000 RSLC Nano System. The mobile phases con-
sisted of (A) 0.5% acetic acid with 5% DMSO and (B) 0.5% acetic
acid in 80% acetonitrile with 5% DMSO (Hahne et al., 2013).
The linear gradient condition was 5%–99% B for 10 min, 99% B
for 5 min, and 5% B for 30 min at a flow rate of 500 mL/min. A spray
voltage of 2,300 V was applied. The MS scan range was 100–1,500
m/z every 0.25 s. Blank runs were inserted between different sam-
ples. All raw data files from the TripleTOF 5600 system were
analyzed by PeakView software version 2.1 (AB Sciex). Extracted-
ion chromatograms were observed with ±0.01 m/z width for
each of caffeine (m/z = 195.0867), cimetidine (m/z = 253.123), pro-
pranolol (m/z = 260.1645), epinastine (m/z = 250.13387), prazosin
(m/z = 384.16663), quinidine (m/z = 325.19105), sulpiride (m/z =
342.1482), trazodone (m/z = 372.15856), antipyrine (m/z =
189.10224), and carbamazepine (m/z = 237.10224).
Statistical Analysis
At least three independent experiments were performed. Statistical
analysis of the data was performed using ANOVA. p < 0.05 was
considered significant. Values are reported as mean ± SEM.
