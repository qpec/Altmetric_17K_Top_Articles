SUMMARY
The insular cortex is injured in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and
responds inappropriately to autonomic challenges, suggesting neural
reorganization. The objective of this study was to assess whether the
neural changes might result from c-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and
glutamate alterations. We studied 14 OSA patients [mean age � stan-
dard deviation (SD): 47.5 � 10.5 years; nine male; apnea–hypopnea
index
(AHI):
29.5 � 15.6 events h�1]
and
22
healthy
participants
(47.5 � 10.1
years; 11 male), using magnetic resonance spectroscopy to detect
GABA and glutamate levels in insular cortices. We localized the cortices
with anatomical scans, and measured neurochemical levels from anterior
to mid-regions. Left and right anterior insular cortices showed lower
GABA and higher glutamate in OSA versus healthy subjects [GABA left:
OSA n = 6: 0.36 � 0.10 (mean � SD), healthy n = 5: 0.62 � 0.18;
P < 0.05), right: OSA n = 11: 0.27 � 0.09, healthy n = 14: 0.45 � 0.16;
P < 0.05; glutamate left: OSA n = 6: 1.61 � 0.32, healthy n = 8:
0.94 � 0.34; P < 0.05, right: OSA n = 14: 1.26 � 0.28, healthy n = 19:
1.02 � 0.28; P < 0.05]. GABA and glutamate levels were correlated only
within the healthy group in the left insula (r: �0.9, P < 0.05). The altered
anterior insular levels of GABA and glutamate may modify integration
and projections to autonomic areas, contributing to the impaired
cardiovascular regulation in OSA.
INTRODUCTION
The insular cortex in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) shows
structural and functional alterations, which likely contribute to
adverse autonomic and affective symptoms characteristic of
the syndrome (Harper et al., 2003; Kumar et al., 2012; Macey
et al., 2008). The altered functions include distorted insular
functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) signals accompanying
sympathetic nervous system challenges, and probably under-
lie the high sympathetic outflow in OSA, presumably con-
tributing to the profuse sweating, cardiac arrhythmia and
hypertension in the disorder. The insular injury in OSA also
probably facilitates the development of depression and
anxiety in the condition (Asghari et al., 2012; Kurth et al.,
2010; Marin et al., 2012). Mechanisms underlying insular
dysfunction in OSA are unclear, but understanding the nature
of the brain alterations could provide insights into symptoms
that persist even with treatment (Marin et al., 2012), as well as
processes underlying partial or complete resolution with
continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) of other symp-
toms, such as high sympathetic tone (Fatouleh et al., 2015).
Structural brain alterations in OSA could arise from multiple
pathologies. Reduced mean diffusivity, apparent in many
OSA brain regions (Kumar et al., 2012), reflects an increase
in barriers to intercellular water movement, which could arise
from cell swelling due to inflammation or increased cell size
due to glial activation. fMRI differences appear in the insular
cortex during autonomic challenges (Harper et al., 2003).
The processes underlining those differences could be eluci-
dated by determining the levels of the neurotransmitters

Apnea, GABA and Glutamate
 glutamate and c-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which can now
be measured non-invasively. Levels of these chemicals are
sensitive to neural reorganization in response to injury, and
can reflect different functional states (Arckens et al., 2000).
High levels of glutamate, in particular, are associated with
excitotoxicity, a probable mechanism of injury in some brain
areas in OSA.
The objective of this study was to assess GABA and
glutamate in the anterior insular cortex in OSA patients, relative
to healthy subjects. The anterior mid-insula was selected, as
that subregion preferentially serves autonomic roles (Macey
et al., 2012). We hypothesized that, relative to healthy people,
OSA patients would show elevated glutamate, based on the
potential for hypoxia-induced excitotoxic conditions and
altered GABA levels, based on impaired insular action.
METHODS
We studied 14 OSA patients [mean age: 47.5 � 10.5 years;
nine male; mean apnea–hypopnea index (AHI): 29.5 �
15.6 events h�1; SAO2 min: 83 � 9%] and 22 healthy sub-
jects (mean age: 47.5 � 10.1 years; 11 male). Patients were
diagnosed at the UCLA Sleep Disorders Center. No partic-
ipants had a history of head trauma or disease, current
mental illness, use of psychoactive medications, cancer or
cardiac disease. Patients were untreated, apart from two who
had a prior history of CPAP use. Healthy subjects were
screened to exclude sleep disorders. Procedures were
approved by the UCLA Institutional Review Board, and
participants provided written informed consent.
Neurotransmitters
were
measured
with
a
magnetic
resonance spectroscopy (MRS) method based on ‘two-
dimensional’ MRS (Sarma et al., 2014; see Supporting
information). Neurochemicals changes were measured using
compressed
sensing
(CS)-based
four-dimensional
(4D)
echo-planar J-resolved spectroscopic imaging (EP-JRESI).
High-resolution T1-weighted scans were acquired for local-
ization of insular cortex. Group differences in GABA and
glutamate concentrations (ratios with respect to creatine) in
the anterior to mid-insular cortex and adjacent tissue were
assessed with t-tests. The relative concentrations of ‘Glx’, a
combination of glutamate and glutamine indicative of gluta-
mate levels, were also assessed, as Glx is a more robust
MRS measure than glutamate.
RESULTS
Neurotransmitter concentrations were recorded successfully
from subsets of the 22 healthy and 14 OSA subjects
(Table 1; example spectra Fig. 1). Differences between
OSA and healthy subjects emerged for GABA (Fig. 2a) and
glutamate (Fig. 2b) in the right and left insulae. The left insula
showed poorer data quality in more subjects than the right
(right successful measures: 69% GABA, 92% glutamate; left
successful measures: 31% GABA, 39% glutamate). Success
rates were similar for the OSA and healthy groups. When the
two OSA patients with a prior history of CPAP were excluded
the mean differences were similar, and the significant
differences between OSA and healthy subjects remained,
with the exception of glutamate in the right insula. However,
Glx showed significantly higher levels in OSA versus healthy
subjects in the right and left insulae, with and without
excluding the two previously treated subjects (Table 1).
Correlations between GABA and glutamate were significant
only in healthy subjects in the left insula (r: �0.90, P: 0.04;
Table 2; Fig. 2c,d).
DISCUSSION
The anterior insular cortex in OSA shows low GABA and
high
glutamate,
conditions
which
would
modify
neural
patterns within the structure. GABA normally acts as an
inhibitory
neurotransmitter,
while
glutamate
is
normally
excitatory to neural processes. The influences of the insular
cortices are complex, with both inhibitory and excitatory
influences on hypothalamic, cingulate and frontal cortical

 structures, among others. On a simplistic level, the combi-
nation of a reduction in the inhibitory GABA and increase in
the excitatory glutamate could reflect a more active state
overall; however, the complexity of the insular projections to
multiple structures precludes such an exclusive generaliza-
tion
(Kurth
et al.,
2010).

 enhanced glutamate could enhance insular influences, and
the normal inhibition over hypothalamic structures could be
reduced by the lower GABA levels, leading potentially to the
exaggerated sympathetic tone in the condition. The altered
neurotransmitter levels could also modify cingulate and
hippocampal projections influencing mood, such as depres-
sion and anxiety, both of which are common in OSA. Low
GABA in the insula has been associated with high levels of
anxiety (Rosso et al., 2014), and levels appear to be
associated with processing of interoceptive stimuli, a func-
tion linked with depressive mechanisms (Wiebking et al.,
2014). The structures involved in anxiety and depression
include the anterior cingulate, recipient of fibres from the
cingulum and insular cortices. High glutamate has been
found in these limbic areas in bipolar disorder (Soeiro-De-
Souza et al., 2015). The hypoxia exposure during apneic
events probably leads to excessive excitation of the insular
connecting
fibres,
and
such excitotoxic
processes
are
facilitated by glutamate. It is unknown whether the altered
neurotransmitter levels revert to normal with CPAP treat-
ment, but such knowledge would assist the selection of
interventions and the determination of whether regional
GABA and glutamate levels could be useful biomarkers of
local neural tissue state in OSA.
The findings of reduced GABA and higher glutamate build
upon an earlier demonstration of alterations in the anterior
insular cortex in OSA, including changes in structure, function
and metabolite levels. The insula shows impaired responses
to autonomic challenges in OSA, especially during periods of
sympathetic activity increases (Harper et al., 2003). Resting
state functional patterns also differ from heathy subjects when
those patterns are correlated with other regions (Zhang et al.,
2015). Changes in water diffusivity reflect structural changes
arising probably from glial activation or inflammation due to
hypoxia, and damage to neurones or axons and myelin
(Kumar et al., 2012; Macey et al., 2008). Increased myo-
inositol in the left insula of OSA patients is also consistent with
glial alterations (Yadav et al., 2014). Increased glutamate
levels may arise directly from astrocyte activation, as astro-
cytic glutamate is an energy source for neurones (Pellerin and
Magistretti, 1994); if metabolism is altered by OSA in the
insular cortex, glutamate from astrocytes may increase to
compensate. The combined chemical, functional and struc-
tural findings confirm injury and reorganization of the insula in
OSA, which probably contribute to clinical symptoms in the
condition (Asghari et al., 2012; Kurth et al., 2010; Macey
et al., 2013; Marin et al., 2012).
The high glutamate may reflect damaging excitotoxic
processes arising from intermittent hypoxia (Jagadapillai
et al., 2014). Only 5 h of intermittent hypoxia simulating
OSA effects can lead to cellular death (Pae et al., 2005);
thus, similar processes are probably operating in people with
OSA. However, the high glutamate measured here was in
whole tissue, and does not necessarily correspond to
concentrations in extracellular fluid, where the neurochemical
is key for excitotoxicity.
Interventions complementary to CPAP that influence neu-
rotransmitter levels may help to normalize brain function in
OSA. Both GABA and glutamate can be manipulated directly
with pharmacological approaches and indirectly with beha-
vioural changes. The measurements presented here could
serve as a biomarker of any intervention targeting these brain
chemicals.
Measurements were successful in 58% of instances, with
the remainder not meeting quality criteria, especially in the
left insula. Because OSA and healthy measurements were
affected similarly, the low data quality is due probably to
technical rather than biological reasons (e.g. poor shim-
ming). The resolution of the MRS voxels was limited
(example in Fig. 1), so the measures did not cover the
entire anterior to mid-portion of the structure, and included
adjacent tissue; the subregion studied will have varied
slightly between subjects.
In conclusion, the anterior to mid-insular cortex shows lower
GABA and higher glutamate levels in OSA compared with
healthy subjects. These alterations probably reflect a func-
tional neural reorganization that contributes to the autonomic
and psychological symptoms in OSA, such as high sympa-
thetic tone and refractory hypertension, and anxiety, depres-
sion and cognitive difficulties. High glutamate would facilitate
excitotoxic processes. The altered neurotransmitter levels
provide a biomarker of regional functional status of the OSA
brain, and will allow insights into the neurological effects of
treatment with CPAP or other interventions.
