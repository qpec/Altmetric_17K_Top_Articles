angladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS) 2014 is the seventh national-level demographic 
and health survey designed to provide information to address the monitoring and evaluation needs 
of the Health, Population and Nutrition Sector Development Program (HPNSDP) and to provide 
managers and policy makers involved in this program with the information that they need to effectively plan 
and implement future interventions. The survey generates evidences on basic national indicators of social 
progress including fertility, childhood mortality, fertility preferences and fertility regulation, maternal and 
child health, nutritional status of mothers and children, and awareness and attitude towards HIV/AIDS. 
In addition to presenting the main findings from BDHS 2014 on fertility, family planning, maternal 
and child health and nutrition, this report highlights the major changes that have taken place in Bangladesh’s 
demographic and health situation since 1993-94. Results of BDHS 2014 illustrate that Bangladesh has 
achieved the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) 4 target ahead of time. There are evidences that 
Bangladesh is moving ahead in achieving MDG 5. Since BDHS 2004, deliveries attended by skilled 
providers have increased by 2.6 times and deliveries in health facilities have increased by more than 3 times. 
Khulna and Rangpur divisions have reached HPNSDP target of total fertility rate 2.0. Rajshahi and Barisal 
divisions are near to reach the target. Fertility also continues to decline in Chittagong and Sylhet divisions. 
BDHS data show continuous improvement in nutritional status of children. HPNSDP targets for prevalence 
of stunting and underweight have already been achieved. 
The findings of this report and its policy and programmatic implications will be instrumental in 
monitoring and evaluation of HPNSDP and in designing the next HPN sector program in Bangladesh. The 
need, however, for further detailed analysis of BDHS data remains. I hope that such analysis will be carried 
out by the academicians, researchers and program personnel to provide more in-depth knowledge for future 
direction and effective program implementation in the coming years. 
The successful completion of BDHS 2014 was made possible by the contributions of a number of 
organizations and individuals. I would like to thank NIPORT, Mitra & Associates and ICF International for 
their efforts in conducting BDHS 2014. I deeply appreciate the United States Agency for International 
Development (USAID), Bangladesh for providing financial assistance that helped ensure the ultimate 
success of this important national survey.

angladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS) 2014 is the seventh survey of its kind conducted 
in Bangladesh. This survey was implemented through a collaborative effort of the National Institute 
of Population Research and Training (NIPORT), ICF International, USA and Mitra & Associates. 
The financial support for the survey was provided by the United States Agency for International 
Development (USAID), Bangladesh. 
The wealth of demographic and health data that BDHS 2014 provides is essential and instrumental 
in monitoring and evaluating the performance of the Health, Population and Nutrition Sector Development 
Program (HPNSDP). BDHS presents estimates for 18 indicators of the Results Framework of HPNSDP and 
considered as a major source of information for program monitoring. We hope the survey data will assist 
policymakers and program managers in monitoring and designing programs and strategies for improving 
health, family planning, and nutrition services in the country. 
Members of the Technical Review Committee (TRC), consisting of experts from government, Non-
government and international organizations as well as researchers and professionals working in the Health 
Nutrition and Population Sectors were involved and gave their expert opinion in various phases of the survey 
implementation. A Technical Working Group (TWG) was also formed with the representatives from 
NIPORT, PMMU-MOHFW, University of Dhaka, icddr,b, USAID/Bangladesh, Save the Children, ICF 
International and Mitra and Associates for designing the survey questionnaires and the implementation of 
the survey. I would like to put on record my sincere appreciation to TRC and TWG members for their sincere 
effort in different stages of the survey. I extend sincere thanks to the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS) 
for their support in selecting sample clusters and providing Enumeration Area (EA) maps for the survey. 
The preliminary results of BDHS 2014, with its key indicators were released through a 
dissemination seminar in April 2015. This final report brings more comprehensive analysis of the survey 
results. Along with the key results, detailed findings and possible interpretations are presented in the final 
report. 
This report is an outcome of contributions of the professionals of NIPORT, NIPSOM, University of 
Dhaka, icddr,b, ICF International, MEASURE Evaluation, USAID/Bangladesh, SMC, and Mitra & 
Associates. I would like to acknowledge everyone for their contributions to BDHS 2014 Final Report. 
I would like to congratulate all the professionals of Research Unit of NIPORT for the successful 
completion of the survey. I also extend my thanks to ICF International and Mitra & Associates for completing 
the task in a professional manner. Finally, USAID/Bangladesh deserves special thanks for providing 
technical and financial support for the survey.

1.1 
GEOGRAPHY AND ECONOMY 
angladesh is located in the northeastern part of South Asia and covers an area of 147,570 square 
kilometers. It is almost entirely surrounded by India, except for a short southeastern frontier with 
Myanmar and a southern coastline on the Bay of Bengal (see map on facing page). It lies between 
latitudes 20° 34′ and 26° 38′ north and longitudes 88° 01′ and 92° 41′ east. The Moguls ruled the country 
from the 13th until the 18th century, when the British took over and administered the subcontinent until 
1947. During British rule, Bangladesh was a part of India. In 1947, the independent states of Pakistan and 
India were created. The present territory of Bangladesh was a part of Pakistan. Bangladesh emerged on 
March 26, 1971, as an independent country on the world’s map following a war of liberation. 
Most of Bangladesh is low, flat land that consists of alluvial soil. The most significant feature of the 
terrain is the extensive network of rivers that is of primary importance to the socioeconomic life of the nation. 
Chief among these, lying like a fan on the face of the land, are the Ganges-Padma, Brahmaputra-Jamuna, 
and Megna rivers. 
The tropical climate of Bangladesh is dominated by seasonal monsoons. The country experiences a 
hot summer season with high humidity from March to June; a somewhat cooler, but still hot and humid, 
monsoon season from July through early October; and a cool, dry winter from November through the end of 
February. The fertile delta is subject to frequent natural calamities, such as floods, cyclones, tidal bores, and 
drought. 
The administrative divisions of the country consist of 7 divisions, 64 districts, and 545 
upazilas/thanas. Muslims make up almost 90 percent of the population of Bangladesh, Hindus account for 
about 9 percent, and other religions constitute the remaining 1 percent (BBS 2014). The national language 
of Bangladesh is Bangla, which is spoken and understood by all. 
Industry has emerged as the largest sector of the economy, contributing about 30 percent of the 
gross domestic product (GDP). The GDP has continued to grow over 6 percent in the last five years and 
exhibited a robust growth rate of 6.5 percent in fiscal year (FY) 2014-2015 (BBS 2015a). The overall growth 
was led by the manufacturing and construction sectors, which recorded impressive expansions of 20 and 7 
percent, respectively, in FY 2014-2015. The accelerated growth in these sectors was mainly due to huge 
investments in large and medium-scale industry. Agriculture is the second largest sector of the economy, 
contributing 16 percent to the total GDP in FY 2014-2015. The largest contributor in the agricultural sector 
is crops and horticulture (9 percent) followed by the fishery sector (4 percent). The gross national income 
(GNI) per capita in Bangladesh has increased to US$1,314 in FY 2014-2015 (BBS 2015b). Bangladesh thus 
becomes a lower middle-income country based on a new income classification of world economies (World 
Bank 2015). 
Recent socioeconomic development of Bangladesh is reflected in the human development index 
(HDI) of the United Nations Development Program (UNDP 2013). Bangladesh’s HDI value for 2014 is 
0.570—which is in the medium human development category—positioning the country at 142 out of 188 
countries and territories (UNDP 2015). Between 1990 and 2014, the country’s HDI value increased from 
0.386 to 0.570, an annual increase of about 1.64 percent. Among the eight South Asian countries, Bangladesh 
is in fifth position based on HDI rank, following Sri Lanka, Maldives, India, and Bhutan.

POPULATION 
Bangladesh is the most densely populated country in the world, excluding city-states such as 
Singapore, Bahrain, and the Vatican. Table 1.1 summarizes the basic demographic indicators for 
Bangladesh. According to recent estimates from the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS), the population 
of the country is about 158 million, with a population density of 1,070 persons per square kilometer in 2014. 
After Census 2011, the population of Bangladesh increased by 8 million, with an annual increase of more 
than 2.0 million. The growth rate between 2001 and 2011 censuses was 1.37 percent. The life expectancy at 
birth in Bangladesh is 71 years, with women having slightly longer lifespans than men (72 years versus 69 
years). 
The country is now experiencing a demographic transition. The continuous decline of the natural 
growth rate is expected to lead to a small population increase in coming decades. In comparison with other 
countries in the region, Bangladesh is in an intermediate position between low-growth countries, such as 
Thailand, Sri Lanka, and Myanmar, and medium-growth countries, such as India and Malaysia (BBS 2011). 
The 2015 projections (medium variant) by the United Nations estimated that the population of Bangladesh 
in 2050 would be about 202 million (UN 2015).

POPULATION, FAMILY PLANNING, AND MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH POLICIES 
AND PROGRAMS 
Family planning was introduced in Bangladesh (then East Pakistan) in the early 1950s through the 
voluntary efforts of social and medical workers. The government of Bangladesh, recognizing the urgency of 
its goal to achieve moderate population growth, adopted family planning as a government sector program in 
1965. 
The policy to reduce fertility rates has been repeatedly reaffirmed by the government of Bangladesh 
since the country’s independence in 1971. The first Five-Year Plan (1973-1978) emphasized “the necessity 
of immediate adoption of drastic steps to slow down the population growth” and reiterated that “no civilized 
measure would be too drastic to keep the population of Bangladesh on the smaller side of 15 crore (i.e., 150 
million) for sheer ecological viability of the nation” (GOB 1994). Beginning in 1972, the family planning 
program received virtually unanimous, high-level political support. All subsequent governments have 
identified population control as a top priority for government action. This political commitment plays a 
crucial role in the fertility decline in Bangladesh. 
In 1976, the government declared the rapid growth of the population to be the country’s number one 
problem and adopted a broad-based, multisectoral family planning program along with an official population 
policy (GOB 1994). Population planning was seen as an integral part of the total development process and 
was incorporated into the successive five-year plans. Policy guidelines and strategies for the population 
program are formulated by the National Population Council, which is chaired by the country’s prime 
minister. 
 Introduction  •  3 
In the mid-1970s the government instituted the deployment of full-time, local family welfare 
assistants, who served as community-based family planning motivators and distributors. At its height a few 
years ago, this program had a staff of almost 24,000. During the same period, a social marketing program to 
promote the sale of birth control pills and condoms was initiated. The population program involves more 
than 200 nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). 
Since 1980 the family planning program has emphasized the importance of integrating health and 
family planning services. The goal is to provide an essential integrated package of high quality, client-
centered reproductive and child health care, family planning, communicable disease control, and curative 
services at a one-stop service point. 
Since 1998 the health program in Bangladesh has drawn on the sector-wide approach (SWAp). The 
SWAp program aims to provide a package of essential, quality health care services that respond to population 
needs, especially those of children, women, the elderly, and the poor. 
The first SWAp—the Health and Population Sector Program (HPSP)—was formulated as part of 
the fifth Five-Year Plan (1998-2003). It was followed by the second SWAp, the Health, Nutrition and 
Population Sector Program (HNPSP), which began in 2003 and expired in June 2011. 
The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW) initiated the Health, Population, Nutrition 
Sector Development Program (HPNSDP) for five years, from July 2011 to June 2016. The HPNSDP is the 
SWAp for the overall improvement of health, population, and nutrition sectors. The main objectives of the 
HPNSDP are to create conditions that allow the Bangladeshi people to reach and maintain the highest 
attainable level of health as a fundamental human right and an issue of social justice. 
The government of Bangladesh (GOB) is working toward achieving Millennium Development 
Goals (MDGs). Of the eight MDGs, three relate to health (child mortality, maternal health, and HIV/AIDS 
and malaria), and these could exert a direct impact on the Bangladeshi population. Furthermore, three other 
goals (universal primary education, poverty eradication, and gender equity) closely relate to human resource 
development. The revised HPNSDP Program Implementation Plan (PIP) sets out sector-specific strategies 
to achieve its goal (MOHFW 2014). These strategies are as follows: 
• 
Streamline and expand the access to and quality of maternal, neonatal, and child health 
services, and, in particular, supervised deliveries (MDG 4 and MDG 5). 
• 
Revitalize various family planning interventions to attain replacement-level fertility. 
• 
Improve and strengthen nutritional services by mainstreaming nutrition within the regular 
Directorate General for Health Services (DGHS) and Directorate General for Family Planning 
(DGFP) services (MDG 1). 
• 
Strengthen preventive approaches and control programs for communicable diseases (MDG 6). 
• 
Expand noncommunicable disease control efforts at all levels by streamlining referral systems 
and strengthening hospital accreditation and management systems. 
• 
Strengthen the various support systems by increasing the health workforce at all service 
levels, including their capacity building and enhanced focus on coordinated implementation of 
operational plans, timely procurement, and effective logistic management, financial 
management, and monitoring and evaluation (M&E). 
• 
Strengthen drug management and improve quality drug provision. 
  
4  •  Introduction 
• 
Pursue priority institutional and policy reforms involving stewardship and oversight functions 
of the public sector, including quality assurance, community participation, and accountability. 
HPNSDP has introduced a Results Framework (RFW) with 8 goal levels and 32 intermediate 
outcome indicators to monitor progress and program impact. A Performance Monitoring Plan (PMP) also 
elaborates on MOHFW’s commitments to (1) collect specific information for the RFW indicators and (2) 
assess program progress for decision making. Recently, MOHFW elaborated on the M&E framework for 
the HPNSDP sector with the lists of the data sources, regular updating of the indicators, and analysis and 
reporting of results (PMMU 2015). The Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS) is identified 
as one of the major sources of data for up-to-date information on 6 goals and 12 output levels of RFW 
indicators of HPNSDP. These are used as a basis to confirm the occurrence of change.

ORGANIZATION OF THE 2014 BANGLADESH DEMOGRAPHIC AND HEALTH SURVEY 
1.4.1 Survey Objectives and Implementing Organizations 
The 2014 Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS) is the seventh DHS undertaken in 
Bangladesh, following those implemented in 1993-94, 1996-97, 1999-2000, 2004, 2007, and 2011. The main 
objectives of the 2014 BDHS are to: 
• 
Provide information to meet the monitoring and evaluation needs of the health, population, 
and nutrition sector development program (HPNSDP) 
• 
Provide program managers and policy makers involved in the program with the information 
they need to plan and implement future interventions 
The specific objectives of the 2014 BDHS were as follows: 
• 
To provide up-to-date data on demographic rates, particularly fertility and infant, and child 
mortality rates, at the national and divisional level 
• 
To measure the level of contraceptive use of currently married women 
• 
To provide data on maternal and child health, including antenatal care, assistance at delivery, 
postnatal care, newborn care, breastfeeding, immunizations, and prevalence and treatment of 
diarrhea and other diseases among children under age 5 
• 
To assess the nutritional status of children (under age 5) and women by means of 
anthropometric measurements (weight and height), and to assess infant and child feeding 
practices 
• 
To provide data on knowledge and attitudes of women about sexually transmitted infections 
and HIV/AIDS 
• 
To measure key education indicators, including school attendance ratios 
• 
To provide community-level data on accessibility and availability of health and family 
planning services 
The 2014 BDHS was conducted under the authority of the National Institute of Population Research 
and Training (NIPORT) of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. The survey was implemented by 
Mitra and Associates, a Bangladeshi research firm located in Dhaka. ICF International of Rockville, 
Maryland, USA, provided technical assistance to the project as part of its international Demographic and 
Health Surveys (DHS) Program. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) provided 
financial support. 
 Introduction  •  5 
1.4.2 Sample Design 
The sample for the 2014 BDHS is nationally representative and covers the entire population residing 
in noninstitutional dwelling units in the country. The survey used a sampling frame from the list of 
enumeration areas (EAs) of the 2011 Population and Housing Census of the People’s Republic of 
Bangladesh, provided by the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS). The primary sampling unit (PSU) for 
the survey is an EA created to have an average of about 120 households. 
Bangladesh is divided into seven administrative divisions: Barisal, Chittagong, Dhaka, Khulna, 
Rajshahi, Rangpur, and Sylhet. Each division is divided into zilas, and each zila into upazilas. Each urban 
area in an upazila is divided into wards, which are further subdivided into mohallas. A rural area in an 
upazila is divided into union parishads (UPs) and, within UPs, into mouzas. These divisions allow the 
country as a whole to be separated into rural and urban areas. 
The survey is based on a two-stage stratified sample of households. In the first stage, 600 EAs were 
selected with probability proportional to the EA size, with 207 EAs in urban areas and 393 in rural areas. A 
complete household listing operation was then carried out in all of the selected EAs to provide a sampling 
frame for the second-stage selection of households. In the second stage of sampling, a systematic sample of 
30 households on average was selected per EA to provide statistically reliable estimates of key demographic 
and health variables for the country as a whole, for urban and rural areas separately, and for each of the seven 
divisions. With this design, the survey selected 18,000 residential households, which were expected to result 
in completed interviews with about 18,000 ever-married women (see Appendix A for the details of the 
sample design). 
Any analysis using the 2014 BDHS data requires that sampling weights be applied to ensure the 
actual representation of the survey results at the national and domain levels. Although the weighted 
distribution of urban-rural households in the survey was based on the urban-rural distribution in the 2011 
population census, the sampling weights were adjusted to reflect a modified urban-rural household 
distribution recently reported by the BBS. After adjusting for undercount and including statistical 
metropolitan areas (SMAs) among the urban areas, the BBS estimated that the urban population was 28 
percent (BBS 2014). The adjustment in the 2014 BDHS sampling weight was to generate a revised urban-
rural population distribution and was not expected to lead to any significant differences in the overall survey 
indicators. 
1.4.3 Questionnaires 
The 2014 BDHS used three types of questionnaires: a Household Questionnaire, a Woman’s 
Questionnaire, and a Community Questionnaire. The contents of the Household and Woman’s 
questionnaires were based on the MEASURE DHS Model Questionnaires. These model questionnaires were 
adapted for use in Bangladesh during a series of meetings with a Technical Working Group (TWG) that 
consisted of representatives from NIPORT, Mitra and Associates, International Center for Diarrheal Disease 
Research, Bangladesh (ICDDR,B), USAID/Bangladesh, and ICF International (see Appendix D for a list of 
members). Draft questionnaires were then circulated to other interested groups and were reviewed by the 
2014 BDHS Technical Review Committee (see Appendix D). The questionnaires were developed in English 
and then translated into and printed in Bangla. 
The Household Questionnaire was used to list all the usual members and visitors in the selected 
households. Some basic information was collected on the characteristics of each person listed, including age, 
sex, education, current work status, birth registration, and individual possession of mobile phones. The main 
purpose of the Household Questionnaire was to identify women who were eligible for the individual 
interview. Information was collected about the dwelling unit, such as the source of water, type of toilet 
facilities, materials used to construct the floor, roof, and walls, ownership of various consumer goods, and 
availability of hand washing facilities. In addition, this questionnaire was used to record the height and 
weight measurements of ever-married women age 15-49 and children under age 6. 
  
6  •  Introduction 
The Woman’s Questionnaire was used to collect information from ever-married women age 15-49. 
Women were asked questions on the following topics: 
• 
Background characteristics (e.g., age, education, religion, media exposure) 
• 
Reproductive history 
• 
Use and source of family planning methods 
• 
Antenatal, delivery, postnatal, and newborn care 
• 
Breastfeeding and infant feeding practices 
• 
Child immunizations and illnesses 
• 
Marriage 
• 
Fertility preferences 
• 
Husband’s background and respondent’s work 
• 
Awareness of AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections 
The Community Questionnaire was administered in each selected cluster during the household 
listing operation and included questions about the existence of development organizations in the community 
and the availability and accessibility of health services and other facilities. During the household listing 
operation, the geographic coordinates and altitude at the center of each cluster were also recorded using 
Garmin eTrex Legend H units1. A list of health facilities and health service providers in each selected EA 
was provided to the interviewing teams to verify information gathered in the Woman’s Questionnaires on 
the types of facilities accessed and health services personnel seen. The Community Questionnaire was 
administered to a group of four to six key informants who were knowledgeable about socioeconomic 
conditions and the availability of health and family planning services/facilities in the cluster. Key informants 
included community leaders, teachers, government officials, social workers, religious leaders, traditional 
healers, and health care providers among others. 
1.4.4 Training and Fieldwork 
Fifty-four people were trained to carry out the listing of households, to delineate EAs, and to 
administer Community Questionnaires. They were also trained in the use of global positioning system (GPS) 
units to obtain locational coordinates for each selected EA. The training lasted a total of five days from May 
14-20, 2014. A household listing operation was carried out in all selected EAs from May 21 to August 17, 
2014, in four phases, each about three weeks in duration. Initially, 20 teams of two persons each were 
deployed to carry out the listing of households and to administer the Community Questionnaires. The number 
of teams was reduced to 19 in the third phase and to 11 in the final phase. In addition, ten supervisors were 
deployed to check and verify the work of the listing teams. 
Training for the fieldworkers of the main survey was conducted from June 1 to 26, 2014. A total of 
164 fieldworkers were recruited based on their educational level, prior experience with surveys, maturity, 
and willingness to spend up to four months on the project. Training included lectures on how to complete 
the questionnaires, mock interviews between participants, and field practice. A former NIPORT staff 
member gave a talk about family planning methods and maternal and child health, including HPNSDP. 
Fieldwork for the BDHS was carried out by interviewing teams, each consisting of one male 
supervisor, one female field editor, five female interviewers, and one logistics staff person. Data collection 
was implemented in four phases, starting on June 28, 2014, and ending on November 9, 2014. The number 
of teams declined with each subsequent phase, starting with 20 teams in the first phase and ending with 16 
teams by the end of data collection. 
Data quality measures were implemented through several activities. There were four quality control 
teams from Mitra and Associates, each comprised of one male and one female staff person. They were sent

to the field to visit the interviewing teams throughout the data collection period. Moreover, the professionals 
of the survey team made several visits to check the fieldwork. 
In addition, NIPORT monitored fieldwork by sending two quality control teams, each comprised of 
three members. The teams went to the field for about three weeks in each phase. They oversaw use of the 
household listings and maps, observed one household and one individual interview of each interviewer, and 
spot-checked the completed questionnaires. The teams also revisited half of the households of one completed 
cluster for each survey team and checked whether selected households were visited and eligible respondents 
were properly identified and interviewed. Debriefing sessions were held between fieldworkers’ tours to 
discuss problems encountered in the field, clarifications, and administrative matters. Data quality was also 
monitored through field check tables generated concurrently with data processing. The main purpose of the 
tables was to allow the quality control teams to advise field teams of problems detected during data entry. 
Representatives from USAID, The DHS Program, and NIPORT, and other Technical Review Committee 
members, also monitored fieldwork through several field visits. 
1.4.5 Data Processing 
The completed 2014 BDHS questionnaires were periodically returned to Dhaka for data processing 
at Mitra and Associates. The data processing began shortly after fieldwork commenced. Data processing 
consisted of office editing, coding of open-ended questions, data entry, and editing of inconsistencies found 
by the computer program. Eight data entry operators and two data entry supervisors processed the data. Data 
processing commenced on July 24, 2014, and ended on November 20, 2014. The task was carried out using 
the Census and Survey Processing System (CSPro), a software jointly developed by the U.S. Census Bureau, 
ICF Macro, and Serpro S.A. 
1.4.6 Coverage of the Sample 
Table 1.2 shows the results of the household and individual women’s interviews. Among a total of 
17,989 selected households, 17,565 were found occupied. Interviews were successfully completed in 17,300, 
or 99 percent of households. A total of 18,245 ever-married women age 15-49 were identified in these 
households and 17,863 were interviewed, for a response rate of 98 percent. Response rates for households 
and eligible women are similar to those in the 2011 BDHS. The principal reason for nonresponse among 
women was their absence from home despite repeated visits to the household. The response rates do not vary 
notably by urban-rural residence.

HOUSING CHARACTERISTICS AND 
HOUSEHOLD POPULATION 
2
 
 
This chapter provides an overview of socioeconomic characteristics of the population, including 
household conditions, sources of drinking water, sanitation facilities, hand washing practices, availability of 
electricity, housing facilities, possession of household durable goods, and ownership of a homestead and 
land. Information on household assets is used to create an indicator of household economic status, the wealth 
index. This chapter also describes the demographic characteristics of the household population, including 
age, sex, educational attainment, and employment status. 
A household in the 2014 BDHS is defined as a person or group of related and unrelated persons 
who usually live together in the same dwelling unit(s), who have common cooking and eating arrangements, 
and who acknowledge one adult member as head of the household. A member of the household is any person 
who usually lives in the household. 
Information is collected from all usual residents of a selected household (de jure population) as well 
as persons who stayed in the selected household the night before the interview (de facto population). The 
difference between these two populations is very small, and all tables in this report refer to the de facto 
population, unless otherwise specified, to maintain comparability with other BDHS reports. 
Key Findings 
• Almost everyone (98 percent) in Bangladesh has access to an improve 
source of drinking water that is they are having water from pipe, tube 
well, protected well, rain or bottle. 
• One in 10 households uses an appropriate water treatment method, 
which includes boiling, bleaching, filtering, and solar disinfecting. The 
proportion has not changed since 2011. 
• Thirty-seven percent of households where a place of washing hands 
was observed had water and a cleansing agent for hand washing. In 
2011, this proportion was 31 percent. 
• The proportion of households having an improved toilet facility that is 
not shared with other households increased from 34 percent in 2011 to 
45 percent in 2014. Four percent of households lack toilet facilities. 
• The proportion of households with electricity increased from 60 percent 
in 2011 to 73 percent in 2014. Eleven percent of households use solar 
electricity; usage is 15 percent in rural and 3 percent in urban areas. 
• Eighty-two percent of households use solid fuel for cooking. 
• Household possession of mobile phones has increased sharply from 78 
percent in 2011 to 89 percent in 2014; ownership is 93 percent in urban 
areas and 87 percent in rural areas. 
• One-third of the population is under age 15. 
• Thirteen percent of households are headed by a woman. 
• Twenty-three percent of men and 27 percent of women age 6 and over 
have not attended school. 
• Sixty-five percent of men and 24 percent of women age 8 and over are 
currently working. 
• Fifty-three percent of household members age 13 and older own a 
mobile phone; ownership is 64 percent in urban and 48 percent in rural 
areas. Forty-five percent of adolescents (age p15-19) own a mobile 
phone; male adolescents are twice as likely as female adolescents to 
own a mobile phone (63 percent versus 31 percent). 
 10  •  Housing Characteristics and Household Population 
2.1 
HOUSEHOLD CHARACTERISTICS 
Physical characteristics of a household are used to assess the general wellbeing and socioeconomic 
status of its members. These characteristics include access to safe drinking water and sanitation facilities. 
Other characteristics are the structure of housing, its crowdedness, and the type of fuel used for cooking. 
2.1.1 Water and Sanitation 
Access to safe water and sanitation are basic determinants of better health. Limited access to safe 
drinking water and sanitation facilities and poor hygiene are associated with skin diseases, acute respiratory 
infections (ARIs), and diarrheal diseases, the leading preventable diseases in Bangladesh. ARI remains the 
leading cause of child deaths in Bangladesh. Diarrheal deaths and prevalence of diarrheal diseases among 
children under age 5 have declined, although 5 percent of under-5 children were reported to have had diarrhea 
in the two-week period in 2011 (NIPORT et al. 2013). 
Table 2.1 presents information on household drinking water by urban-rural residence. Access to an 
improved source of drinking water is almost universal in Bangladesh (98 percent). The most common source 
of drinking water in urban areas is a tube well or borehole (67 percent), followed by water piped into the 
dwelling (14 percent), water piped to the yard or plot (9 percent), and a public tap or standpipe (8 percent). 
In contrast, a tube well or borehole is practically the only source of drinking water in rural areas (94 percent). 
For 76 percent of households, the source of drinking water is within the premises. One in five households 
spends less than 30 minutes round trip to obtain water. As expected, it takes longer to obtain drinking water 
in rural areas than in urban areas.

 Housing Characteristics and Household Population  •  11 
Nationally, 10 percent of households use an appropriate water treatment method, which has not 
changed since 2011 (NIPORT et al. 2013). Rural households are much less likely than urban households to 
treat their water appropriately (3 percent and 27 percent, respectively). Overall, boiling water prior to 
drinking is the most common treatment method (6 percent). However, only one in five urban households 
boil the water for drinking, while less than 1 percent of rural households do so. 
Households without proper sanitation facilities have a greater risk of diseases like diarrhea, 
dysentery, and typhoid than households with improved sanitation facilities that are not shared with other 
households. Table 2.2 shows that 45 percent of households have an improved (not shared) toilet facility, 
which increased from 34 percent in 2011 (NIPORT et al. 2013). Another 24 percent of households use a 
facility that would be considered improved if it were not shared with other households. Facilities that are 
shared are not considered to be as hygienic as those that are not shared. About one-third of the households 
use a non-improved toilet facility (31 percent); 22 percent of households use pit latrines without slabs, and 
3 percent use a hanging toilet. Four percent of households have no toilet facility, nearly unchanged since 
2011, when 5 percent of households had no toilet facility (NIPORT et al. 2013). Rural households are more 
likely than urban households to have no toilet facility (5 percent versus 1 percent). Although the majority of 
households (65 percent) do not share their toilet, rural households are more likely than urban households to 
use a toilet facility that is not shared (67 versus 58 percent, respectively). However, rural households are 
twice as likely to have non-improved toilet facilities as urban households (36 compared with 19 percent).

Hand washing, which protects against communicable diseases, is promoted by the government of 
Bangladesh and its development partners. Table 2.3 provides information on designated places for hand 
washing in households and on the use of water and cleansing agents for washing hands, according to place 
of residence (urban or rural), divisions, and wealth quintiles. 
 12  •  Housing Characteristics and Household Population 
In the 2014 BDHS, interviewers were instructed to observe the place where household members 
usually wash their hands. They looked for regularity of water supply, observed whether the household had 
cleansing agents near the place of hand washing, and noted the location of the place of hand washing. The 
interviewers found designated places for hand washing in almost all the households (96 percent), an 
improvement since 2011, when 86 households had a designated place for hand washing (NIPORT et al. 
2013). 
Twenty-nine percent of households have soap and water in the place where household members 
wash their hands, 8 percent have water and other cleansing agents (ash, mud, sand, etc.), and the majority 
(59 percent) have water only. Overall, 4 percent of households do not have water, soap, or any cleansing 
agent. 
Forty-eight percent of urban households have soap and water compared with 21 percent of rural 
households. Availability of hand washing facilities with soap and water varies across divisions, ranging from 
32 percent of households in Dhaka and Chittagong to 20 percent in Barisal. The use of soap and water for 
hand washing increases with an increase in household wealth. For example, use of soap and water is lowest 
among households in the lowest wealth quintile (6 percent) and highest (75 percent) among those in the 
highest wealth quintile.

Table 2.4 shows that 25 percent of households have a designated place for hand washing, which is 
covered and located inside the dwelling. For 31 percent of households, this place is in open space but not 
shared, and for the remaining 44 percent of households the hand washing place is in an open space and 
shared. Urban households are more likely to have a covered place for hand washing located inside the 
dwelling (46 percent) compared with rural households (17 percent). Only 6 percent of households in the 
lowest wealth quintile were observed to have a place for hand washing that is covered and located inside the 
dwelling, compared with 68 percent of households in the highest wealth quintile.

2.1.2 Housing Characteristics 
Housing characteristics and household assets can be used to measure the socioeconomic status of 
household members. Figure 2.1 shows that 73 percent of households in Bangladesh have access to electricity, 
either from the national grid or solar power connections. Independently, the national grid covers 62 percent 
of households throughout the country, with more coverage in urban areas (91 percent) and less in rural areas 
(51 percent). In contrast, solar power is predominantly used in rural areas (15 percent, compared with 3 
percent in urban areas) and independently serves 11 percent of households in Bangladesh. Overall, access to 
electricity, either from the national grid or solar power, has increased substantially in the last three years, 
from 60 percent in 2011 to 73 percent in 2014. This expansion took place mostly in rural areas (from 49 
percent in 2011 to 65 percent in 2014) rather than in urban areas (from 90 percent in 2011 to 93 percent in 
2014) (NIPORT et al. 2013).

 14  •  Housing Characteristics and Household Population 
Table 2.5 presents information on type of 
flooring material, type of roof and wall materials, and 
number of rooms for sleeping. Earth and sand are the 
most common flooring materials used in Bangladesh (68 
percent). These materials are predominantly used in 
rural areas (82 percent), while in urban areas the most 
common flooring material is cement (61 percent). 
Tin is the most common roofing material in 
Bangladesh. Overall 85 percent of households live in 
dwellings with tin roofs. There is a large urban-rural 
difference in the use of cement or ceramic tiles for roofs. 
Households in urban areas are more than five times as 
likely to use cement tiles as households in rural areas. 
Tin is the predominant material of outer walls 
in 2014 (43 percent), while in the 2007 BDHS walls in 
40 percent of households were made of natural materials 
such as cane, palm, trunks, dirt, or bamboo with mud 
(NIPORT et al. 2009). Twenty-six percent of 
households have walls made of cement. Rural 
households are more likely to have walls made of tin (48 
percent) than urban households (30 percent). On the 
other hand, urban households are more than three times 
as likely to have cement walls (53 percent) as rural 
households (16 percent). 
The number of rooms used for sleeping 
indicates the extent of crowding in households. 
Overcrowding increases the risk of contracting 
infectious diseases, such as tuberculosis, measles, and 
meningitis (Aaby, P. 1988; Acevedo-Garcia, D. 2000; 
Alirol, E. et al. 2011). One in three households has only one room for sleeping. The proportion of households 
using one room for sleeping has decreased from 40 percent in 2007 to 35 percent in 2011 to 33 percent in 
2014 (NIPORT et al. 2009; NIPORT et al. 2013). There are small differences in the number of rooms used 
for sleeping by urban-rural residence. 
Another measure of crowdedness is the number of persons per sleeping room households. The last 
panel in Table 2.5 shows that in two thirds of households a sleeping room is shared by one or two persons. 
In the remaining 35 percent of households, sleeping rooms are shared by three or more persons. Comparison 
with data from the 1993-94 BDHS reveals that the proportion of households with three or more persons per 
sleeping room has decreased from 65 percent in 1993-94 to 35 percent in 2014 (Mitra et al. 1994). This is 
an evidence that households are much less crowded in 2014 than two decades ago. There are only slight 
differences between urban and rural households in the extent of crowding. 
Indoor pollution has important implications for the health of household members. The type of fuel 
used for cooking, the place where cooking is done, and the type of stove used influence indoor air quality 
and the degree to which household members are exposed to the risk of respiratory infections and other 
diseases. Table 2.6 presents information on type of fuel used for cooking and place where cooking is done. 
In Bangladesh, the risk of indoor pollution from cooking fuel is limited because only 15 percent of 
households cook in the house; 68 percent of households cook in a separate building, and 17 percent cook 
outdoors. Urban households are much more likely than rural households to cook in the house (28 versus 10 
percent, respectively).

 Housing Characteristics and Household Population  •  15 
Overall, 82 percent of households use solid fuel, 
including wood, agricultural crops, animal dung, straw, 
shrubs, grass, and charcoal: 50 percent in urban areas and 
virtually all (95 percent) in rural areas. The proportion of 
households that rely on wood for fuel has increased from 
45 percent in 2011 to 50 percent in 2014. The increase 
occurred in both urban (35 percent in 2011 to 37 percent 
in 2014) and rural areas (48 percent in 2011 to 55 percent 
in 2014). As expected, use of liquid petroleum gas, natural 
gas, and biogas is mostly limited to urban areas (48 
percent). 
Reducing the proportion of the population that 
relies on solid fuels is one of the Millennium 
Development Goals. The 2014 BDHS shows that 
Bangladesh is gradually making progress toward this 
goal. The proportion of households that use solid fuel in 
Bangladesh continues to decline from 91 percent in 2007 
to 86 percent in 2011 and to 82 percent in 2014 (NIPORT 
et al. 2009; NIPORT et al. 2013). 
 
 
2.1.3 Household Possessions 
Possession of durable consumer goods is 
another 
useful 
indicator 
of 
household 
socioeconomic status. The possession and use of 
household durable goods have multiple effects and 
implications. For instance, access to a radio or 
television exposes household members to updated 
daily 
events, 
information, 
and 
educational 
materials. Similarly, a refrigerator prolongs food 
storage and keeps food fresh and hygienic. 
Ownership of transportation allows greater access 
to services away from the local area and enhances 
social and economic activities. Table 2.7 shows that 
mobile 
telephones 
are 
the 
most 
common 
information and communication device possessed 
in Bangladesh. Possession of mobile phones has 
increased sharply from 78 percent in 2011 to 89 
percent in 2014. Mobile phones have been widely 
available in the majority of households since 2011. 
In rural areas possession of mobile phones 
increased from 75 percent in 2011 to 87 percent in 
2014, while in urban areas the corresponding 
increase was from 89 percent in 2011 to 93 percent 
in 2014 (NIPORT et al. 2013).

 16  •  Housing Characteristics and Household Population 
The proportion of households possessing a television has increased from 40 percent in 2011 to 44 
percent in 2014. Televisions are more likely to be found in urban households (71 percent) than in rural 
households (33 percent). In contrast, possession of a radio has decreased from 8 percent in 2011 to 4 percent 
in 2014. A refrigerator is available in 20 percent of households, with urban households more than three times 
as likely (41 percent) as rural households (12 percent) to own one. Six in ten households possess an electric 
fan; 86 percent in urban areas and 49 percent in rural areas. Seven percent of households own a DVD/VCD 
player; 12 percent in urban areas and 5 percent in rural areas. 
Bicycling is the most common means of transportation in Bangladesh; 25 percent of households 
own a bicycle, and ownership is much more common in rural areas (28 percent) than in urban areas (17 
percent). Only 6 percent of households own a rickshaw or van (person-driven three wheeler), with no 
difference between rural and urban households. Only 6 percent of households own a motorcycle/motor 
scooter. 
Ninety-two percent of households own a homestead, while 45 percent own land other than a 
homestead. Ownership of a homestead or other land is less common in urban than in rural areas. Ownership 
of land other than a homestead showed a slight decline from 47 percent in 2011 to 45 percent in 2014; 49 
percent of urban households and 37 percent of rural households owned other land (NIPORT et al. 2013). 
Fifty-five percent of households own chicken or ducks, the most commonly owned type of livestock. 
One-third of households owns cows, and one in five households owns goats or sheep. As expected, rural 
households are more likely than urban households to own any type of livestock. 
2.2 
SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS INDEX 
The wealth index used in this survey is a measure that has been used in many DHS and other 
country-level surveys to measure inequalities: in household characteristics, in the use of health and other 
services, and in health outcomes (Rutstein et al. 2000). It serves as an indicator of household-level wealth 
that is consistent with expenditure and income measures (Rutstein 1999). The index is constructed using 
household asset data via principal components analysis. 
In its current form, which takes better account of urban-rural differences in scores and indicators of 
wealth, the wealth index is created in three steps. In the first step, a subset of indicators common to urban 
and rural areas is used to create wealth scores for households in both areas. Categorical variables are 
transformed into separate dichotomous (0-1) indicators. These indicators and those that are continuous are 
then examined using a principal components analysis to produce a common factor score for each household. 
In the second step, separate factor scores are produced for households in urban and rural areas using area-
specific indicators. The third step combines the separate area-specific factor scores to produce a nationally-
applicable combined wealth index by adjusting area-specific scores through a regression on the common 
factor scores. This three-step procedure permits greater adaptability of the wealth index in both urban and 
rural areas. The resulting combined wealth index has a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. Once 
the index is computed, national-level wealth quintiles (from lowest to highest) are obtained by assigning the 
household score to each de jure household member, ranking each person in the population by his or her 
score, and then dividing the ranking into five equal categories, each comprising 20 percent of the population. 
Table 2.8 presents the wealth quintiles by urban-rural residence and administrative division. There 
are sharp differences between urban and rural areas. Half of the urban population (49 percent) is in the 
highest wealth quintile, compared with 9 percent in rural areas. Among the administrative divisions, people 
in Dhaka are more likely to fall in the highest wealth quintile than people in other divisions. In contrast, 
Rangpur and Sylhet divisions have the highest proportion of the population in the lowest wealth quintile (30 
and 29 percent, respectively).

Table 2.8 also includes information on the Gini coefficient, which indicates the level of 
concentration of wealth. This ratio is expressed as a proportion between 0 and 1, 0 being an equal distribution 
and 1 being a totally unequal distribution. Wealth inequality, as measured by the Gini coefficient, is higher 
in rural than in urban areas (38 percent versus 24 percent). Inequality in wealth is similar in Dhaka and 
Chittagong (35 percent and 36 percent, respectively). Inequality in Dhaka has declined from 41 percent in 
2011 to 35 percent in 2014. On the other hand, it increased slightly in Chittagong from 33 percent in 2011 
to 36 percent in 2014. In all other divisions inequality shows a slight decline between 2011 and 2014 
(NIPORT et al. 2013). 
2.3 
HOUSEHOLD POPULATION BY AGE AND SEX 
Table 2.9 shows the distribution of the de facto household population by age, sex, and residence. 
The 2014 BDHS enumerated a total of 77,313 persons (37,672 males and 39,641 females). The sex ratio is 
95 males per 100 females. This is similar to the sex ratio of 93 males per 100 females obtained in the 2011 
BDHS, but it is lower than the ratio of 100.3 males per 100 females obtained in the 2011 Census (BBS 2011). 
The marked difference in the sex ratio between the 2011 Census and the BDHS surveys could be because 
the census’s sex ratio is based on the de jure population, while the sex ratio obtained from the BDHS surveys 
is based on the de facto household population. The sex composition of the population does not vary markedly 
by urban-rural residence. 
One-third of the de facto household population (33 percent) is under age 15, and 10 percent is under 
age 5. People age 65 and older account for 6 percent of the total population. The proportion of population 
under age 15 is lower in urban than rural areas, as is the proportion of population older than age 65.

 18  •  Housing Characteristics and Household Population 
The age-sex structure of the population is shown by the population pyramid in Figure 2.2. The 
pyramid is wider at the base than the top and narrows slightly at the youngest age group. This pattern is 
typical of a historically high-fertility regime that has recently started to stabilize or decline. 
Figure 2.3 shows the distribution of the male and female household populations by single years of 
age. The figure shows that age reporting is less accurate for males than for females. Age heaping is prominent 
at specific ages, such as 10 and 18, for males and females.

Table 2.10 presents changes in the broad age structure of the population since 1989. The proportion 
of population under age 15 has declined from 43 percent in 1989 to 34 percent in 2014. In contrast, 
populations age 15-59 and age 60 and over have increased over time.

HOUSEHOLD COMPOSITION 
Information on household composition is critical 
to an understanding of family size and household 
headship, which can be used to plan meaningful 
population-based policies and programs. Household 
composition is also a determinant of general health status 
and well-being. 
Table 2.11 presents information on household 
composition. The majority (88 percent) of households are 
headed by men. The proportion of female-headed 
households has increased from 11 percent in 2011 to 13 
percent in 2014, with no urban-rural difference. More 
than half of the households in Bangladesh are composed 
of two to four members. The overall average household 
size is 4.5 persons, as compared with 4.6 in 2011. The 
household size is slightly larger in rural (4.5 persons) than 
in urban areas (4.4 persons). 
2.5 
BIRTH REGISTRATION 
According to the amended Birth and Death Registration Act of 2004, which came into force in 2006, 
all children born in Bangladesh must be registered within 45 days of birth and have a birth certificate 
(http://bdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd/bangla_all_sections.php?id=921). The act empowers all union councils, 
municipalities, cantonment boards, city corporations, and Bangladesh missions to act as birth registration 
registrars. In 2010, the government initiated an online birth registration system with 5,082 offices 
administering registrations online. To keep the birth and death database permanent and dynamic, the 
government amended the existing law of birth and death registration in 2013 and announced the 
establishment of the Office of the Registrar General of Birth and Death, which is yet to be set up 
(http://br.lgd.gov.bd/english.html). Birth certificates are made mandatory for school enrolment, passports, 
marriage registrations, job applications, driving licenses, insurance policies, land registrations, voter 
registrations, and national identification cards. 
In the 2014 BDHS, information on birth registration was solicited for children under age 5. Table 
2.12 shows that 2 in 10 children under age 5 had their births registered in 2014, and 17 percent of children 
had a birth certificate.

 20  •  Housing Characteristics and Household Population 
Although the law requires that a newborn be registered within 45 days of birth, Table 2.12 indicates 
that children under age 2 are much less likely to be registered than children age 2-4 (13 and 25 percent, 
respectively). The registration of older children is primarily driven by the practice of asking parents to 
produce a child’s birth certificate for school admission. 
Table 2.12 shows that birth registration is higher in urban (23 percent) than in rural (19 percent) 
areas. There is no difference regarding the extent of birth registration among male and female children. 
Among the administrative divisions, the highest and lowest proportions of children whose births are 
registered are from Sylhet (26 percent) and Rajshahi (13 percent). 
Birth registration of children under age 5 for all groups is lower in 2014 than in 2011 (NIPORT et 
al. 2013). Further investigation is needed to determine reasons for this decline.

SCHOOL ATTENDANCE 
In the 2014 BDHS, information was collected about school attendance of household members age 
6 to 24. Table 2.13 shows that the proportion of the population that attends school declines with age. Whereas 
91 percent of children age 6-10 are in school, the percentage decreases to 82 percent for children age 11-15, 
and to 40 percent for children age 16-20. School attendance is higher among girls than among boys age 6-
15, but boys age 16-20 and age 21-24 are more likely to be in school than girls. These data may reflect the 
impact of recent efforts to promote universal education, especially among girls.

School attendance rates for children under age 16 are slightly higher in rural areas than in urban 
areas. In contrast, urban men and women age 16-24 are more likely to be in school than their rural 
counterparts. 
School attendance among age groups has increased since 2011. For example, the proportion of 
children age 6-15 who are attending school has increased from 84 percent in 2011 (NIPORT et al. 2013) to 
87 percent in 2014. 
2.7 
EDUCATION OF HOUSEHOLD POPULATION 
Education is one of the major socioeconomic influences on a person’s behaviors and attitudes. In 
general, the greater a person’s educational attainment, the more knowledgeable he or she is about the use of 
health services, family planning, and the health care of children. The government of Bangladesh enacted a 
mandatory primary education law in 1990 to achieve universal primary enrolment by 2005, which is in line 
with the UN Child Rights Convention. Bangladesh must provide free and equal primary education of quality 
for all children (GOB 1990). 
To meet the demand for education, the government of Bangladesh has increased investment in the 
educational sector. Education is divided into two broad categories, primary and secondary. In addition, the 
government has recently initiated opening up non-grade-level schools at pre-primary education. The 
government also implements non-formal education for adults to increase the literacy rate. To promote job-
oriented education, skill development institutes that have a vocational and technical focus have increased 
over the years in various parts of the country. The National Education Policy of Bangladesh (MOE 2010) 
explicitly stipulated that education would be free up to the secondary level in the public sector and provided 
subsidies to create demand for education of the poor and of girls in an effort to meet MDG targets. 
2.7.1 Educational Attainment of the Household Population 
For all household members age 6 or older, data were collected on the level of education last attended 
and the highest class completed at that level. The findings are presented in Tables 2.14.1 and 2.14.2. 
The majority of Bangladeshis age 6 and older have attended school. Twenty-three percent of men 
and 27 percent of women have never attended school. Gender difference in primary education is very little. 
However, men are more likely to complete secondary school or to attain a higher education compared with 
women (17 percent versus 12 percent). There has been an increase in the proportions of men and women 
who have completed secondary or higher education since 2011. For men, the proportion has increased from 
15 percent to 17 percent, and for women it has increased from 10 percent to 12 percent in 2014. 
Changes in educational attainment by successive age groups indicate the long-term trend in a 
country’s educational achievement. The data show marked improvement in the educational attainment of 
both men and women over the years. The proportion of men with no education is notably higher (39 percent) 
among those age 45-49 than among boys age 10-14 (6 percent). Similarly, 50 percent of women age 45-49 
have no education compared with only 3 percent of girls age 10-14. 
 22  •  Housing Characteristics and Household Population 
Overall, levels of educational attainment are higher in urban than in rural areas (Tables 2.14.1 and 
2.14.2). The proportions of men and women with no education are lower in urban areas (17 percent of men 
and 21 percent of women) than in rural areas (25 percent of men and 29 percent of women), while the 
proportions who have completed secondary or higher schooling are greater in urban areas (26 percent of men 
and 20 percent of women) than in rural areas (13 percent of men and 9 percent of women). On average, men 
and women living in urban areas have completed 2 more years of school than those in rural areas. There are 
also regional variations in educational attainment. Barisal division has the highest proportion of men and 
women with some education (83 percent of men and 82 percent of women).

For men and women, wealth exerts a positive influence on educational attainment. For instance, 40 
percent of men in the lowest quintile have never attended school compared with 8 percent of men in the 
highest quintile. While 45 percent of men in the lowest wealth quintile had no education in 2011, in 2014 
this proportion has declined to 40 percent. For women, the corresponding proportions are 47 and 41 percent, 
respectively.

A comparison of the completed median years of schooling since 2000 is presented in Figure 2.4. In 
2000, the completed median years of schooling was 2.6 for men and 1.2 for women. Between 2000 and 2014 
the completed median years of schooling had increased to 3.8 among men and to 3.5 among women. 
Although the completed median years of schooling continues to be higher for men than for women, the 
gender difference has declined from 1.4 years in 2000 to 0.3 years in 2014.

2.7.2 School Attendance Ratios 
The net attendance ratio (NAR) indicates participation in primary schooling for the population age 
6-10 and participation in secondary schooling for the population age 11-17. The gross attendance ratio 
(GAR) measures participation at each level of schooling among those of any age. The GAR is almost always 
higher than the NAR for the same level because the GAR includes participation by those who may be older 
or younger than the official age range for that level. A NAR of 100 percent would indicate that all of those 
in the official age range for that level are attending at that level. The GAR can exceed 100 percent if there is 
significant over-age or under-age participation at a given level of schooling. Table 2.15 shows that the NAR 
at the primary level is 86 percent (86 percent for males and 87 percent for females) and the NAR at the 
secondary level is 43 percent (42 percent for males and 44 percent for females). 
The differences in NAR at the primary and secondary school levels between urban and rural areas 
are small. Among the administrative divisions, Dhaka has the lowest NAR and GAR at the primary level. 
Sylhet has the highest NAR and GAR at the primary level, but the lowest NAR and GAR at the secondary 
level. At the primary level, the NAR and GAR show no clear pattern by wealth quintile. The NAR and GAR 
at secondary school level are lowest among the children from the lowest wealth quintile. 
Table 2.15 also shows the Gender Parity Index (GPI), which represents the ratio of the NAR and 
GAR for females to the NAR and GAR for males. It is a more precise indicator of gender differences in the 
schooling system. A GPI greater than 1.00 indicates that a higher proportion of females than males attends 
school. The GPI at the primary and secondary levels is slightly higher than 1.00 indicating that gender 
differences in schools are in favor of girls.

1 The NAR for primary school is the percentage of the primary-school-age (6-10 years) population that is attending primary 
school. The NAR for secondary school is the percentage of the secondary-school-age (11-17 years) population that is attending 
secondary school. By definition the NAR cannot exceed 100 percent. 
2 The GAR for primary school is the total number of primary school students, expressed as a percentage of the official primary-
school-age population. The GAR for secondary school is the total number of secondary school students, expressed as a 
percentage of the official secondary-school-age population. If there are significant numbers of over-age and under-age students 
at a given level of schooling, the GAR can exceed 100 percent. 
3 The Gender Parity Index for primary school is the ratio of the primary school NAR (GAR) for females to the NAR (GAR) for 
males. The Gender Parity Index for secondary school is the ratio of the secondary school NAR (GAR) for females to the NAR 
(GAR) for males. 
 
 
Figure 2.5 shows that, for ages 5-14, girls have a higher level of school attendance than boys. The 
pattern reverses at age 16 and older. Attendance is highest at age 9 for boys and at age 11 for girls.

EMPLOYMENT 
The 2014 BDHS collected information regarding the working status of each person age 8 and older 
at the time of the survey. Table 2.16 shows that men are much more likely than women to be employed (65 
percent and 24 percent, respectively). Table 2.16 also shows that the urban population is more likely to be 
employed than the rural population. For men, the proportion is 69 percent in urban and 63 percent in rural 
areas, and for women, the proportion is 25 percent and 24 percent, respectively.

OWNERSHIP OF MOBILE PHONES 
Information regarding ownership of mobile phones among household members age 13 and older 
was collected during the 2014 BDHS. Table 2.17 shows that 53 percent of the population owns a mobile 
phone. Urban people are more likely to own a mobile phone (64 percent) than rural people (48 percent). Men 
are almost twice as likely as women to own a mobile phone. In urban areas, 78 percent of men own a mobile 
phone compared with 50 percent of women. In rural areas the corresponding proportions are 66 percent and 
33 percent, respectively. Men and women in the age groups 20-29 and 30-39 are more likely to own a mobile 
phone than other age groups. Among adolescents age 15-19, 45 percent own a mobile phone. Male 
adolescents are twice as likely to own a mobile phone as female adolescents. Adolescents in urban areas are

his chapter presents the demographic and 
socioeconomic profile of ever married women 
age 15-49 interviewed in BDHS 2014. The 
information helps one to interpret findings and 
understand results presented in the report. The chapter 
begins by describing basic background characteristics, 
including age, marital status, residence, education, and 
wealth status. Information is also presented on 
exposure to mass media and employment status. The 
2014 
BDHS 
includes 
results 
from 
completed 
interviews with 17,863 ever-married women age 15-49. 
3.1 
CHARACTERISTICS OF SURVEY 
RESPONDENTS 
Basic background characteristics of the 17,863 
ever-married women are presented in Table 3.1. About 
half of the women (48.4 percent) are under age 30. 
The majority of women (94 percent) are 
currently married. Seven in ten respondents (72 percent 
of women) reside in the rural areas. The respondents are 
not evenly distributed across geographic divisions. 
More than one-third (35 percent) of the respondents 
live in Dhaka, 19 percent reside in Chittagong, 12 
percent each in Rajshahi and Rangpur, 10 percent in 
Khulna, 7 percent in Sylhet, and 6 percent in Barisal. 
The proportion of sampled women in Chittagong and 
Rangpur divisions is similar to that in the 2011 BDHS. 
However, the proportion in three divisions has 
increased; in Dhaka by 2.5 percent, in Sylhet by 1.5 
percent, and in Barisal by 0.6 percent. On the other 
hand, it decreased in two divisions; in Rajshahi by 3.1 
percent and in Khulna by 1.7 percent. Twenty-five

EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT 
Education is one of the most influential determinants of an individual’s knowledge, attitudes, and 
behaviors. The educational attainment of a population is an important indicator of the society’s stock of 
human capital and level of socioeconomic development. Education enhances the ability of individuals to 
achieve desired demographic and health goals. Table 3.2 presents differentials in the educational attainment 
of women by selected background characteristics.

Table 3.2 shows that 25 percent of ever-married women age 15-49 have never been to school, 18 
percent have completed some primary education, 11 percent have completed all primary education, 32 
percent have completed some secondary education, and 14 percent have completed all secondary education 
or continued on to higher education. Older women, women in rural areas, and those in the lowest wealth 
quintile are most likely to have no education. Urban-rural differences in education are prominent at the 
secondary and higher levels. For example, urban women are almost two and half times more likely than rural 
women to have completed secondary or higher education (25 percent and 10 percent, respectively). 
Between 13 and 19 percent of women in all geographic divisions have completed secondary or 
higher-level education except in Sylhet, where the percentage is only 9 percent. Sylhet also has the highest 
proportion of women with no education (32 percent). Women in the highest wealth quintile are most likely 
to complete secondary or higher-level education; 39 percent of women in the highest wealth quintile 
achieved this level. 
 Characteristics of Respondents  •  31 
In Bangladesh, women age 15-49 have completed a median of 4.6 years of schooling. The 
differentials across subgroups of women are reflected in the medians. For example, the median number of 
years of schooling for women in the highest wealth quintile is 9.2 years compared with 1 year for women in 
the lowest quintile. 
Figure 3.1  Trends in education of ever-married women, 2007-2014 
 
There have been improvements in educational attainment in Bangladesh over the past seven years. 
The percentage of ever-married women with no education has declined, from 28 percent in 2011 to 25 
percent in 2014. Another indicator of progress in education is the median length of schooling. For women, 
it increased from 4.3 years in 2011 to 4.6 years in 2014 (NIPORT et al. 2013). 
3.3 
LITERACY 
Literacy is widely acknowledged as benefiting both the individual and society. Particularly among 
women, literacy is associated with positive outcomes, including intergenerational health and nutrition 
benefits. The ability to read and write empowers both women and men. Knowledge of the level of literacy 
that a population may attain is important for policymakers and program managers who design information 
materials. 
The 2014 BDHS defined literacy based on the respondent’s ability to read all or part of a sentence. 
To test respondents’ reading ability, interviewers carried a set of cards with simple sentences printed in 
Bangla. Respondents who had attended at least some secondary school were assumed to be literate. 
Respondents who had never been to school and those who had not attended school at the secondary level 
were asked to read the cards during the interview. Table 3.3 presents the findings. 
Table 3.3 indicates that 66 percent of ever-married women age 15-49 are literate. The level of 
literacy decreases as age increases; 86 percent of women age 15-24 are literate compared with 39 percent of 
women age 45-49. Literacy varies by urban-rural residence; 74 percent of urban women are literate, 
compared with 63 percent of rural women.

Divisional differences in literacy are notable. The proportion of women who are literate ranges from 
57 percent in Sylhet to 76 percent in Barisal. Literacy has improved in the past three years in all divisions 
except Sylhet. The improvement ranges from 1 percent in Khulna to 8 percent in Rangpur. There is also a 
marked difference in literacy level by household wealth, ranging from 41 percent among women in the 
lowest wealth quintile to 87 percent among women in the highest wealth quintile.

ACCESS TO MASS MEDIA 
Access to information through the media is essential to increase people’s knowledge and awareness 
of what takes place around them. The 2014 BDHS assessed exposure to media by asking respondents if they 
listened to the radio, watched television, or read newspapers or magazines at least once a week. To plan 
effective programs to disseminate information about health and family planning, it is important to know 
which subgroups of population are most likely to be reached by specific media. 
Table 3.4 shows that 51 percent of ever-married women age 15-49 watch television at least once a 
week, 6 percent read a newspaper at least once a week, and 3 percent listen to the radio at least once a week. 
Less than 1 percent of women are exposed to all three media sources each week. Close to half (47 percent) 
of women have no exposure to any of the mass media on a weekly basis.

Figure 3.2 shows the proportion of women listening to the radio every week has decreased markedly 
over the years, dropping from 19 percent in 2007, to 5 percent in 2011 and 3 percent in 2014. Television 
reaches the most women throughout the period (47 percent in 2007, 48 percent in 2011, and 51 percent in 
2014). 
Younger women are more likely to watch television or listen to the radio than older women. There 
is a wide gap in media exposure by urban-rural residence. For example, the proportion of urban women who 
watch television once a week is 78 percent compared with 40 percent of rural women. Media exposure is 
positively related to the respondent’s educational level and economic status. Regular exposure to mass media 
is highest among women with secondary or higher education and women in the highest wealth quintile.

EMPLOYMENT 
The 2014 BDHS asked respondents a number of questions regarding their employment status, 
including whether they had worked in the 12 months before the survey. The results are presented in Table 
3.5. 
At the time of the survey, 33 percent of ever-married women age 15-49 were currently employed. 
Three percent were not working, although they had worked in the 12 months prior to the survey, while the 
remaining 64 percent said that they had not been employed in the previous 12 months (Table 3.5). The 
proportion currently employed is lowest among women age 15-19 (16 percent) and peaks at 40 percent in 
the 40-44 age group. The level of employment increases with  the number of children. Women who have 
five or more children are more likely to be employed (37 percent) compared with women with no children 
(23 percent). 
Rural women are more likely than urban women to be employed (34 percent compared with 31 
percent). Variations are found across geographic divisions. The proportion of women who are employed 
ranges from 42 percent in Rajshahi to 18 percent in Sylhet. 
The proportion of women who are currently employed decreases with education. For example, 42 
percent of women with no education are employed compared with 25 percent of women who completed 
secondary level. Women in the lowest wealth quintile are more likely to be currently employed compared 
with women in the highest wealth quintile (41 percent and 25 percent, respectively).

3.6 
OCCUPATION 
Respondents who had worked in the 12 months preceding the survey were asked about their 
occupation. The results are presented in Table 3.6, which shows the distribution of employed women by 
occupation, according to background characteristics. Four in ten working women are engaged in poultry or 
cattle raising (41 percent), 14 percent work as semi-skilled labor, and 6 percent perform professional or 
technical services. Eight percent each of women are engaged in business and factory or blue collar services, 
and 7 percent each perform home-based manufacturing work or serve as domestic servants. The relationship 
between women’s occupation and age is mixed; younger women are more likely than older women to be 
engaged in factory work, semi-skilled labor services, and home-based manufacturing activities. In contrast, 
older women are more likely than younger women to work in business, in agriculture, or as domestic 
servants.

Urban-rural residence has a marked effect on occupation. As expected, rural women are more likely 
than urban women to be engaged in agriculture, poultry or cattle raising, and unskilled labor or business. In 
contrast, women in urban areas are more likely to be engaged in professional or technical services, factory 
work or blue collar services, semi-skilled labor/services, home-based manufacturing work, and as domestic 
servants. 
About one in two women (48 percent) with secondary or higher levels of education are employed 
in professional or technical jobs, and about one in four work in semi-skilled services. In contrast, women 
with little or no education are more likely than those with more education to be engaged in factory or blue 
collar services and as domestic servants. The majority of women in the highest wealth quintile are engaged 
in professional/technical work (24 percent), worked in factory or blue collar services (12 percent), semi-
skilled labor/service (30 percent), and as domestic servants (11 percent). The majority of women in the 
lowest wealth quintile are unskilled laborers and farmers or agriculture workers.

Table 3.7 shows the percent distribution of ever-married women employed in the 12 months prior 
to the survey by type of earnings, type of employer, and continuity of employment. This table presents data 
by whether respondents work in the agricultural or nonagricultural sector. Overall, 8 in 10 women who were 
employed work for cash only, and 6 percent receive cash and in-kind payment. There are significant 
variations in cash payment between women who work in agriculture (80 percent) and those who do not work 
in agriculture (91 percent).

The proportion of women in agricultural work who receive cash payment has declined from 90 
percent in 2011 to 85 percent in 2014. At the same time, the proportion of women who were paid entirely in 
kind is almost similar to that in an earlier survey (about 2 percent) (NIPORT et al. 2013). 
Less than half of women (46 percent) are employed by family members, one in three women (35 
percent) are employed by a nonfamily member, and 20 percent are self-employed. Women who work in 
agriculture are more likely than women who work in the nonagricultural sector to be employed by a family 
member (62 and 27 percent, respectively), while women who work in the nonagricultural sector are more 
often employed by a nonfamily member (58 and 14 percent, respectively). 
Eighty-five percent of employed women work all year round, and 15 percent work either seasonally 
(7 percent) or occasionally (8 percent). Continuity of employment varies by sector. Eighty-eight percent of 
women who work in the agricultural sector work year round, compared with 83 percent of women engaged 
in nonagricultural work. Twelve percent of women who are employed in agricultural sector are seasonal or 
occasional workers.

INTRODUCTION 
his chapter addresses the principal factors, other than contraception, that affect a woman’s risk of 
becoming pregnant: nuptiality and sexual intercourse, postpartum amenorrhea and abstinence from 
sexual relations, and menopause. The chapter also includes information on more direct measures of 
the beginning of exposure to pregnancy and the level of exposure: age at first sexual intercourse and the 
frequency of intercourse. Finally, measures of several other proximate determinants of fertility which, like 
marriage and sexual intercourse, influence exposure to the risk of pregnancy are presented: durations of 
postpartum amenorrhea, postpartum abstinence, and menopause. 
Marriage is a primary indication of the exposure of women to the risk of pregnancy and, therefore, 
is important for the understanding of fertility. Populations in which age at marriage is low tend to be 
populations with early childbearing and high fertility. For this reason, there is an interest in trends in age at 
marriage. 
Only women who had been married or were married were interviewed with the 2014 BDHS 
Woman’s Questionnaire. However, a number of the tables presented in this chapter are based on all women, 
both ever-married and never-married. For these tables, the number of ever-married women interviewed in 
the survey is multiplied by an inflation factor that equals the ratio of all women to ever married women, as 
reported in the Household Questionnaire. This procedure expands the denominators in those tables, so that 
they represent all women. The inflation factors are calculated by single years of age. When the results are 
presented by background characteristics, single-year inflation factors are calculated separately for each 
category of the characteristic. 
The definition of marriage is not universal for all countries and religions. In Bangladesh, it is 
common for a woman to wait several months or even years after formal marriage before starting to live with 
her husband. Since the 2014 BDHS is interested in marriage mainly as it affects exposure to the risk of 
pregnancy, interviewers were instructed to ask questions about marriage in terms of cohabitation rather than 
T 
Key Findings 
• Age at first marriage among women has risen slowly over the past two 
decades. The median age at first marriage among women age 20-49 
increased from 14.4 years in 1993-94 to 16.1 years in 2014. 
• Fifty-nine percent of women age 20-24 now marry before age 18. 
Between 2000 and 2011, the percentage that married before age 18 
changed very little. In the last three years, however, this percentage has 
dropped noticeably, from 65 percent in 2011 to 59 percent in 2014. 
• Seventy-eight percent of ever-married women were sexually active within 
the past four weeks, and another 12 percent were active within the past 1 
to 12 months. 
• Thirteen percent of currently married women reported that their husbands 
lived elsewhere, and 5 percent of currently married women said they had 
not seen their spouse in the 12 months preceding the survey. 
• Almost 40 percent of women age 15-49 would have preferred to marry 
later than they actually did. Half of the women who married before age 18 
would have preferred to marry later.

education and employment.

CURRENT MARITAL STATUS 
Table 4.1 shows the current marital status of women age 15-49 by age. The proportion of never 
married women age 15-49 is 15 percent. This proportion falls sharply with increasing age. It declines from 
55 percent for women age 15-19 to less than 1 percent among women age 35 or older. The low proportion 
of women age 25-29 who have never been married (4 percent) indicates that marriage is universal in 
Bangladesh and that more than nine in ten women marry before age 30. 
Eight in ten women (80 percent) are currently married. Three percent of women age 15-49 are 
widowed. The proportion of women who are widowed increases sharply with age and is mostly limited to 
older age groups: 8 percent of women age 40-44 and 13 percent of women age 45-49 are widowed. Divorce 
and separation are uncommon in Bangladesh. Two percent of women age 15-49 are either divorced or 
separated. The proportion divorced or separated does not vary markedly by age group.

Table 4.2 shows the trend in the percentage of women who have never married by age group for the 
1975-2014 period. The proportion of women who have never married affects fertility levels in a society like 
Bangladesh, where childbearing outside of marriage is uncommon. The proportion of never-married women 
age 15-19 has increased from 30 percent in 1975 to 55 percent in 2014. Similarly, the proportion of never-
married women age 20-24 increased from 5 percent in 1975 to 19 percent in 1999-2000 and then declined 
with some fluctuations to 16 percent in 2014.

AGE AT FIRST MARRIAGE 
Marriage is the leading social and demographic indicator of the exposure of women to the risk of 
pregnancy. Marriage in Bangladesh marks the point in a woman’s life when childbearing becomes socially 
acceptable. Age at first marriage has a major effect on childbearing because the risk of pregnancy depends 
primarily on the age at which women first marry. Women who marry early, on average, are more likely to 
have their first child at a young age and give birth to more children overall, contributing to higher fertility. 
As never-married women were not interviewed in the BDHS, tables on age at marriage were 
generated using expansion factors. The expansion factors are based on the assumption that the reporting of 
age and marital status in the Household Questionnaire is correct. This means that there was no bias in the 
reporting of age of ever-married women and that there were no errors in the reporting of marital status, 
especially of young women. 
Table 4.3 shows, by current ages, the percentages of women who have married, the percentages who 
have never married, and the median age at first marriage. Marriage occurs early for women in Bangladesh. 
Among women age 20-49, 71 percent married by age 18, and 85 percent married by age 20. Within each age 
cohort, the proportion of women marrying by a specific age increases. For example, among women age 25-
29, 69 percent married by age 18 and 94 percent married by age 25. 
The proportion of women marrying in their early teens continues to decline. For example, the 
proportion of women marrying by age 15 has declined by more than two-thirds over time, from 46 percent 
among women now age 45-49 to 16 percent among women age 15-19. Similarly, the proportion of women 
marrying by age 18 and age 20 decreases substantially from the oldest to the youngest cohort. 
Table 4.3 shows a slow but steady increase over the last three decades in the age at which 
Bangladeshi women first marry, from a median age of 15 years for women in their mid to late forties to 17.2 
years for those in their early twenties.

A comparison of the 2014 BDHS survey results with findings from prior surveys confirms that the 
median age at first marriage for women in Bangladesh continues to increase. The median age at marriage 
among women age 20-49 has increased by almost two years, from 14.4 years in 1993-94 (Mitra et al. 2004) 
to 16.1 years in 2014. 
The legal age of marriage for women in Bangladesh is 18 years, but a large proportion of marriages 
still take place before the woman reaches her legal age. The 2014 BDHS found that 59 percent of women 
age 20-24 were married before age 18 (Figure 4.1). Between 2000 and 2011, the proportion who married 
 42  •  Marriage and Sexual Activity 
before age 18 had hardly changed. But between 2011 and 2014 this proportion declined from 65 percent to 
59 percent, the largest change ever observed between two BDHS surveys. Over the past two decades, the 
proportion of women marrying before the legal age has decreased by 14 percentage points overall from 73 
percent in 1993-94 to 59 percent in 2014.

Table 4.4 examines the median age at first marriage 
for women age 20-49 and 25-49, according to background 
characteristics. The median age at first marriage among 
women age 20-49 is 16.1 years. Urban women marry one year 
later than their rural counterparts (16.9 years versus 15.8 
years). The median age at marriage varies among 
administrative divisions. It ranges from 15.3 years in Rangpur 
to 17.6 years in Sylhet. 
Women’s education shows a strong positive 
association with age at marriage. For example, women who 
have completed secondary or higher education marry almost 
five years later than those with no education. Similarly, age at 
marriage increases with household wealth. Women in the 
highest wealth quintile marry two years later than those in the 
lowest wealth quintile.

 Marriage and Sexual Activity  •  43 
4.4 
AGE AT FIRST SEXUAL INTERCOURSE 
Age at first marriage is often used as a proxy for first exposure to intercourse and risk of pregnancy. 
But these two events may not occur at the same time because some people may engage in sexual activity 
before marriage. To obtain insight into onset of sexual activity, the 2014 BDHS asked ever-married women 
how old they were when they first had sexual intercourse. It was recognized that the answer to this question 
might be biased since the respondent may have been uncomfortable providing information on premarital sex. 
In fact, the BDHS results show that virtually no ever-married women reported initiating sexual activity 
before they first married. 
Table 4.5 shows the percentage of women age 15-49 who had first sexual intercourse by specific 
ages, the percentage who never had sexual intercourse, and the median age of first sexual intercourse. The 
table was generated using the information on the age at first sex from the ever-married women interviewed 
in the BDHS and assuming that never-married women have not had intercourse. Given the conservative 
nature of the Bangladeshi society, that assumption is likely correct for many never-married women. 
However, it is clearly a source of potential for bias in the reporting of age at first intercourse, because some 
women who have never married are likely to have initiated sexual activity. It also must be recognized that 
not all ever married women who engaged in premarital sexual activity are likely to report that behavior in 
the survey, adding to the bias in the results shown in Table 4.5. Nevertheless, the data in Table 4.5 are useful 
since they document the information the BDHS was able to obtain on premarital sexual activity in 
Bangladeshi society. 
Table 4.5 shows that the median age at first sexual intercourse among women age 20-49 (16.2 years) 
is almost equal to the median age at first marriage (16.1 years). The median age at first sexual intercourse is 
higher among women age 20-24 than among older women. 
Looking at specific ages, 33 percent of women age 20-49 had sexual intercourse by age 15, which 
compares with 69 percent by age 18, and 83 percent by age 20. Five percent of women age 20-49 had never 
experienced sexual intercourse.

Table 4.6 examines the median age at first sexual 
intercourse 
among 
women 
age 
20-49 
by 
background 
characteristics. Women living in rural areas tend to initiate sexual 
intercourse earlier than their urban counterparts. There is greater 
variation in median age at first sexual intercourse among 
administrative division than by urban or rural residence. Women 
in Sylhet are likely to start having sexual intercourse about two 
years later than women in Rangpur. 
Women age 25-49 who have completed secondary or 
higher education initiate sex about five years later than women 
with no education. Age at first sexual intercourse also increases 
with household wealth. 
4.5 
RECENT SEXUAL ACTIVITY 
In the absence of contraception, the possibility of 
pregnancy is positively related to the frequency of sexual 
intercourse. Thus, information on intercourse is important for 
refining measurement of exposure to pregnancy. All ever-married 
women were asked how long ago their last sexual contact 
occurred. As the length of time since their last sexual contact 
increased, the chance of becoming pregnant decreased. Table 4.7 
shows the percent distribution of ever-married women age 15-49 
by timing of their last sexual intercourse, according to 
background characteristics. 
The data show that 78 percent of ever-married women 
age 15-49 were sexually active during the four weeks preceding 
the survey. An additional 12 percent were sexually active in the 12 months preceding the survey, and 10 
percent had their last sexual intercourse one or more years prior to the survey. 
Women in the oldest group (45-49), are the least likely to have had their last sexual intercourse in 
the past four weeks (64 percent) compared with the youngest women. More than 8 in 10 married women age 
20-24, 25-29, and 30-34 had their last sexual intercourse in the four weeks preceding the survey. There are 
no noticeable variations in recent sexual activity by marital duration and by urban-rural residence. 
There are large variations in the timing of last sexual intercourse by administrative divisions. The 
proportion of women who were sexually active in the past four weeks ranges from 70 percent in Chittagong 
to 85-86 percent in Rajshahi and Rangpur. The relationship between a woman’s education and sexual activity 
shows no clear pattern; however, women with no education are the least likely to have been sexually active 
in the past four weeks (75 percent). In contrast, women in the lowest wealth quintile are the most likely to 
have had their last sexual intercourse in the past four weeks (80 percent) when compared with women in the 
higher quintiles.

SPOUSAL SEPARATION 
Repeated seasonal migration has the potential to lower birth rates. The effect of spousal separation 
in reducing fertility varies with the length of separation. It is expected that the cumulative impact of spousal 
separation is greatest in areas of relatively high fertility and low modern contraceptive prevalence. However, 
this has been difficult to ascertain as there have not been many studies to illustrate the effect of spouse 
separation on fertility. 
Table 4.8 shows the percentage of currently married women age 15-49 whose husband lives 
elsewhere and the frequency of the husband’s visits in the last 12 months. Overall, 13 percent of currently 
married women have a husband who lives elsewhere. Younger women, age 15-19 (19 percent), women who

have been married fewer  than 5 years (20 percent), and rural women (14 percent) are more likely than other 
women to have husbands who live elsewhere. One in four women in Chittagong (24 percent) have husbands 
who live elsewhere compared with only 5 percent of women in Rangpur. The proportion of women with a 
husband who lives elsewhere increases with the woman’s education and wealth status. Only 6 percent of 
women with no education live apart from their husbands compared with 20 percent of those with secondary 
or higher education. Similarly, 6 percent of women in the lowest wealth quintile live separately from their 
husbands compared with 17 percent of women in the fourth quintile. 
Women whose husbands live elsewhere were asked how often their husband came to visit in the 
past 12 months. Forty-two percent of women say that their husband did not come home in the past 12 months, 
36 percent reported that their husband visited 1 to 5 times, 13 percent visited 6 to 11 times, and 8 percent 
visited 12 or more times. Close to half of women age 30-34 and those married 10-14 and 15-19 years are 
more likely than other women to report that their husbands did not come home in the past 12 months. There 
is no substantial variation by urban-rural residence or educational attainment. The number of husband’s visits 
varied widely by administrative division: only 15 percent of women in Rangpur were not visited by their 
 Marriage and Sexual Activity  •  47 
husbands in the past 12 months compared with 63 percent of women in Sylhet. The percentage of women 
whose husbands did not visit in the past year has a negative association with wealth quintile. Husbands of 
women in the three highest quintiles are less likely to visit their wives compared with those in the lower 
quintiles, possibly because they are more likely to be employed overseas rather than locally. 
4.8 
PERCEPTION TOWARD AGE AT FIRST MARRIAGE 
Table 4.9 shows the percentage of women age 15-49 by preferred age at marriage, according to 
background characteristics. Overall, more than 50 percent of women think that their marriage took place at 
an appropriate age, 39 percent would have preferred to marry later, and 8 percent would have preferred to 
marry at an earlier age. Older women (age 21-49) are more likely than younger women to say that their 
marriage took place at the right time (54 versus 28 percent). Half of the women (49 percent) who married 
before age 18 would have preferred to marry later. 
There are small urban-rural variations regarding preferred and actual age at first marriage. However, 
there are greater differences across divisions. Whereas 62-63 percent women in Sylhet and Chittagong think 
that their marriage was took place at the right age, only 43-44 percent of women in Rangpur and Khulna 
share this opinion. Seven in 10 women who have completed secondary or higher education think that they 
married at the right age compared with 51 percent of women with no education. Variations across wealth 
quintiles are less notable. It is interesting to note that 40 percent of women with no education and 39 percent 
of women belonging to the lowest quintile want to marry later than their actual age at marriage.

FERTILITY

ertility is one of the three principal components of population dynamics that determine the size, 
structure, and composition of the population in any country. The focus on fertility is due to its 
important role in determining Bangladesh’s population growth rate and its impact on economic 
development. The government of Bangladesh (GOB), which has formulated a National Population Policy 
(MOHFW 2012), seeks to reduce fertility to replacement level by 2015. The Health, Population and Nutrition 
Sector Development Program (HPNSDP) of Bangladesh embraced program and strategies for reducing 
fertility through improved access to health, family planning, and nutrition services for the poor and 
geographically marginalized population (MOHFW 2011a, MOHFW 2011b). Examining current fertility 
levels, trends, and differentials in Bangladesh will help the policy makers and program managers to monitor 
and evaluate the HPNSDP. 
This chapter describes current and past fertility, cumulative fertility, birth intervals, age at first birth, 
and the reproductive behavior of adolescents. Most of the fertility measures are based on the birth history 
data collected during interviews with ever-married women age 15-49. In the 2014 BDHS each woman was 
asked a series of questions that could be used to construct a retrospective history of all of her births. To 
encourage complete reporting, the interviewer asked the respondent about the number of sons and daughters 
living with her, the number living elsewhere, and the number who had died. The interviewer then asked for 
a history of all births, including month and year, name, sex, and survival status of each birth. The interviewers 
were given extensive training in probing techniques designed to help respondents report this information 
accurately. 
 
F
Key Findings 
• The total fertility rate for the three years preceding the survey is 2.3 births 
per woman, the same as in the 2011 BDHS. The aim of the 2011-2016 
health sector program is to reach a fertility level of 2.0 births per woman 
by 2016. 
• Between the 2011 and 2014 BDHS, fertility declined or remained the 
same in 6 of 7 divisions. Dhaka is the only division where the total fertility 
rate increased from 2.2 to 2.3.  
• The total fertility rate in urban areas is nearly half a child lower than in 
rural areas (2.0 and 2.4 births per woman, respectively). 
• Khulna and Rangpur divisions have passed the fertility level target of 2.0 
births per woman (1.9 births per woman), while Rajshahi and Barisal are 
close behind (2.1 and 2.2 births per woman, respectively). Sylhet has the 
highest fertility (2.9 births per woman).  
• Childbearing begins early in Bangladesh, with almost half of women age 
25-49 giving birth by age 18 and nearly 70 percent giving birth by age 20. 
• Birth intervals are generally long in Bangladesh, with a median interval of 
52 months. The median interval increased from 47 months in 2011. The 
proportion of women with a birth interval of less than 36 months declined 
from 32 percent in 2011 to 29 percent in 2014.  
• Thirty-one percent of adolescents age 15-19 in Bangladesh are already 
mothers or pregnant with their first child. This proportion has not changed 
in the last three years. 
 50  •  Fertility 
The following measures of current fertility are derived from the birth history data: 
• 
Age-specific fertility rates1 (ASFRs) are expressed as the number of births per 1,000 women in 
a certain age group. They are a valuable measure to assess the current age pattern of 
childbearing. ASFRs are defined as the number of live births during a specific period to women 
in a particular age group, divided by the number of woman-years lived in that age group during 
the specified period. 
• 
The total fertility rate (TFR) represents the average number of children a woman would have 
by the end of her reproductive period if her experience followed the currently prevalent age-
specific fertility rates. The TFR is calculated as the sum of the age-specific fertility rates 
multiplied by five (each age group covers five years of age). 
• 
The general fertility rate (GFR) is expressed as the annual number of live births per 1,000 
women age 15-44, and the crude birth rate (CBR) provides a measure of the annual number of 
live births per 1,000 population. 
The various measures of current fertility are calculated for the three-year period preceding the 
survey, which roughly corresponds to the calendar years 2012-2014. A three-year period was chosen because 
it reflects the current situation without unduly increasing sampling error. 
Despite efforts to improve data quality, data from the BDHS are subject to the same types of errors 
that are inherent in all retrospective sample surveys: the possibility of omitting some births (especially births 
of children who died at a very young age) and the difficulty of accurately determining each child’s date of 
birth. These errors can bias estimates of fertility trends, which then have to be interpreted within the context 
of data quality and sample sizes. A summary of the quality of the BDHS data appears in the tables in 
Appendix C. 
5.1 
CURRENT FERTILITY 
Some current fertility measures are presented in Table 
5.1 for the three-year period preceding the survey. ASFRs and 
the TFR for Bangladesh as a whole and for urban and rural areas 
are shown, along with the GFR and crude birth rate. The TFR is 
a useful measure of the level of recent fertility. The 2014 BDHS 
shows that the TFR for the three-year period before the survey is 
2.3 children per woman. The overall age pattern of fertility, as 
reflected in the ASFRs, indicates that Bangladeshi women have 
a pattern of early childbearing (Figure 5.1). According to current 
fertility rates, on average, women will have 25 percent of their 
births before reaching age 20, 55 percent during their twenties, 
and 18 percent during their thirties. Fertility is 113 births per 
1,000 women age 15-19, which increases to a peak of 143 births 
per 1,000 women age 20-24, and declines thereafter. 
                                                                      
1 Numerators for age-specific fertility rates are calculated by summing the number of live births that occurred in the 
period 1-36 months preceding the survey (determined by the date of interview and the date of birth of the child) and 
classifying them by the age of the mother (in five-year groups) at the time of birth (determined by the mother’s date of 
birth). The denominators for the rates are the number of woman-years lived in each of the specified five-year age groups 
during the period 1-36 months preceding the survey. Because only women who had ever married were interviewed in 
the BDHS, the number of women in the denominator of the rates was inflated by factors calculated from information in 
the Household Questionnaire on the proportions ever married to produce a count of all women. Never-married women 
are presumed not to have given birth.

 Fertility  •  51 
The TFR in the rural areas is higher than in urban areas (2.4 compared with 2.0 births per woman). 
As the ASFRs show, the pattern of higher rural fertility is prevalent in all age groups. The urban-rural 
difference in fertility is most pronounced for women in the 20-24 age group (125 births per 1,000 women in 
urban areas versus 151 births per 1,000 women in rural areas). 
Figure 5.1  Age-specific fertility rates by urban-rural residence 
 
5.2 
FERTILITY DIFFERENTIALS 
Table 5.2 shows that fertility varies widely by administrative divisions. Khulna and Rangpur 
divisions have the lowest fertility (1.9 births per woman) and thus have achieved the aim of HPNSDP to 
reduce fertility to 2.0 births per woman by 2016. Rajshahi and Barisal, with TFRs of 2.1 and 2.2, respectively, 
are very close to achieving the HPNSDP aim. Although fertility is still high in Sylhet and Chittagong 
divisions, it has declined from that in the 2011 BDHS. Between the 2011 BDHS and the 2014 BDHS, the 
TFR in Sylhet declined from 3.1 to 2.9 births per woman and in Chittagong declined from 2.8 to 2.5 births 
per woman. The only division where fertility has increased is Dhaka. Since Dhaka Division constitutes about 
one-third of Bangladesh’s population, it has the largest impact on the national fertility rate. 
As expected, women’s education is associated with fertility. The TFR decreases from 2.4 births for 
women with no education to 2.0 births for women who have completed secondary or higher education. 
Fertility is also negatively associated with wealth; the difference in fertility between women in the lowest 
and highest wealth quintiles amounts to 0.8 child per woman, on average. 
As shown in Table 5.2, at the time of the survey, 5 percent of women age 15-49 reported that they 
were pregnant. Reports may be underestimates, especially in the case of pregnancies at early stages, because 
some women may be unaware of or unwilling to reveal their current status. The percentage of women 
currently pregnant is higher in rural areas than in urban areas (5 percent and 4 percent, respectively). The 
percentage of women age 15-49 currently pregnant varies by administrative division. Nine percent of women 
are currently pregnant in Sylhet, compared with 4 percent in Khulna and Rajshahi. The relationship between 
the percentage currently pregnant and education is U-shaped, rising from a low of 3 percent among women 
with no education to a high of 6 percent among women with some secondary education, and then dipping 
again to 5 percent among women who have completed secondary or higher education. Women in the lowest 
wealth quintile are more likely to be currently pregnant (7 percent) than women in the highest quintile (4 
percent).

Table 5.2 also presents the mean number of children ever born to women age 40-49, which allows 
for a crude assessment of trends in fertility. Whereas TFR is a measure of current fertility, the mean number 
of children ever born to women age 40-49 is a measure of past or completed fertility. Although comparing 
completed fertility among women age 40-49 with the TFR can provide an indication of fertility change, it is 
vulnerable to the understatement of parity by older women. Findings on age at marriage and contraceptive 
use are also of critical importance in reaching a balanced judgment about fertility trends. Unless there is 
evidence of increased age at marriage and/or an appreciable use of contraception, it is unlikely that fertility 
has declined. In Bangladesh, the comparison of past and present fertility indicators, together with 
corresponding increases in contraceptive use and women’s age at marriage, suggests a decline of almost two 
children per woman, from 3.9 to 2.3 children. There has been a substantial decline in fertility in both urban 
and rural areas, in all regions, and for all wealth quintiles. The difference between current and completed 
fertility is highest in rural areas (1.7 births), in Barisal and Sylhet (2 births), and among women in the second 
and middle wealth quintiles (1.8 and 1.9 births). 
5.3 
FERTILITY TRENDS 
Trends in fertility can be assessed in two ways. The first way is to use retrospective data from birth 
histories collected in the 2014 BDHS. The second is to compare the TFR from the 2014 BDHS with estimates 
obtained in earlier surveys. 
 
 
 Fertility  •  53 
Trends in fertility over time can be examined by 
comparing age-specific fertility rates from the 2014 BDHS 
for successive five-year periods preceding the survey, as 
presented in Table 5.3.1. The rates for older age groups 
become progressively more truncated for periods more 
distant from the survey date, because women age 50 and 
older were not interviewed in the survey. For example, rates 
cannot be calculated for women age 35-39 for the period 15-
19 years before the survey because these women would have 
been over age 50 at the time of the survey and therefore not 
eligible to be interviewed. Nonetheless, the results show that 
fertility has dropped substantially among all age groups over 
the past two decades. The largest fertility decline is observed 
between the two most recent five-year periods. Fertility decline is steepest among the cohort age 30-34, with 
a 58 percent decline (from 141 births to 59 births) between the period 15-19 years before the survey and the 
period 0-4 years before the survey. 
Trends in fertility in Bangladesh since the early 1970s can be examined by observing a time series 
of estimates produced from demographic surveys fielded over the last four decades, beginning with the 1975 
Bangladesh Fertility Survey (BFS). The TFRs for the seven BDHS surveys since 1993-1994 and the three 
preceding surveys carried out since 1975 are presented in Table 5.3.2 and Figure 5.2, and age-specific 
fertility rates from 2004 to 2014 are presented in Figure 5.3. The data indicate that fertility in Bangladesh 
has been declining since the 1970s. The TFR declined sharply from 6.3 births per woman in 1971-1975 to 
5.1 births per woman in 1984-1988, followed by another rapid decline in the next decade of 1.8 births per 
woman to reach 3.3 births per woman in 1994-1996. Following a decade-long plateau in fertility during the 
1990s at around 3.3 births per woman, the TFR declined further by one child and remains at 2.3 births per

Figure 5.2  Trends in total fertility rates, 1975-2014 
 
An examination of the changes in the age-specific fertility rates in Table 5.3.2 and Figure 5.3 
indicates that while the peak childbearing age has remained in the 20-24 age group, the largest absolute 
change in fertility also occurred in this age group, declining from 192 births per 1,000 women in the 2004 
BDHS to 143 births per 1,000 women in the 2014 BDHS. 
Figure 5.3  Trends in age-specific fertility rates, 2004-2014 
 
Figure 5.4 shows that in the 2014 BDHS, Khulna and Rangpur divisions have the lowest TFR (1.9 
births per woman), and Sylhet division has the highest TFR (2.9 births per woman). The data indicate that 
in the last three years fertility has slightly declined in four divisions (Barisal, Chittagong, Rangpur, and 
Sylhet), remained the same in two divisions (Khulna and Rajshahi) and slightly increased in Dhaka division. 
Since Dhaka is by far the largest division—comprising one-third of Bangladesh’s population—the fertility 
rate of this division has a large impact on the national fertility rate. Changes in fertility over time should be 
interpreted with caution in the absence of sampling errors.

CHILDREN EVER BORN AND LIVING 
Table 5.4 shows the distribution of all women and currently married women by age and number of 
children ever born. It also shows the mean number of children ever born to women in each five-year age 
group, an indicator of the momentum of childbearing. The mean number of children ever born for all women 
is 2.1, while currently married women have 2.5 births on average. Allowing for mortality of children, 
Bangladeshi women have, on average, 1.9 living children. Currently married women have an average of 2.2 
living children.

Currently married women age 45-49 have given birth to an average of 4.2 children, of whom 3.6 
have survived. Among all women age 15-49, the average number of children who have died per woman is 
0.19. Among currently married women, it is 0.22; that is, 9 percent of children born to currently married 
women have died. The percentage of children who have died increases with women’s age. Among currently 
married women, for example, the proportion of children ever born who have died increases from 5 percent 
for women age 20-24 to 14 percent for women age 45-49. The proportion of children for currently married 
women age 20-24 and 45-49 who have died slightly decreases in the last three years. 
Nearly one-quarter (24 percent) of all women age 15-49 have never given birth. This proportion is 
highest among women age 15-19, as 75 percent of women in this age group have never given birth. However, 
this proportion declines to 28 percent among women age 20-24 and rapidly decreases further for older 
women. The percentage of women who have never given birth is quite low (less than 2.5 percent) among all 
women age 35-44, indicating that childbearing among Bangladeshi women is nearly universal. 
Overall, 10 percent of currently married women age 15-49 have never given birth. The difference 
in the mean number of children ever born between all women and currently married women is due to the 
substantial proportion of young and unmarried women in the former category. 
The percentage of women in their forties who have never had children is an indicator of the level of 
primary infertility—that is, the proportion of women who are unable to bear children at all. Since voluntary 
childlessness is rare in Bangladesh, it is likely that married women with no births are unable to have children. 
The 2014 BDHS results suggest that primary infertility is low in Bangladesh, at slightly more than 2 percent. 
This estimate does not include secondary infertility, that is, women who may have had one or more births 
but who are unable to have additional children. 
5.5 
BIRTH INTERVALS 
Birth interval is the length of time between two successive live births. Examination of birth intervals 
provides insight into birth spacing patterns and, subsequently, maternal, infant, and childhood mortality. 
Short birth intervals are associated with an increased risk of death for mother and child. Studies have shown 
that children born less than 24 months after a previous sibling risk poor health as well. Short birth intervals 
also threaten maternal health. 
 
 Fertility  •  57 
Table 5.5 shows the percent distribution of non-first births that occurred in the five years preceding 
the survey by number of months since the previous birth, according to background characteristics. Birth 
intervals are generally long in Bangladesh, with a median interval of 52 months. Lengthy breastfeeding and 
a long period of postpartum amenorrhea are likely to contribute to the relatively high percentage of births 
occurring after an interval of 24 months or more in Bangladesh. More than 70 percent of non-first births 
occur three or more years after the previous birth, while 18 percent of births take place 24-35 months after 
the previous birth. Eleven percent of children are born after an interval that is considered “too short,” i.e., 
less than 24 months.

Note: First-order births are excluded. The interval for multiple births is the number of months since the preceding pregnancy that ended 
in a live birth. 
1 Primary complete is defined as completing grade 5. 
2 Secondary complete is defined as completing grade 10. 
 
 
The median number of months since a preceding birth increases significantly with age, from 24 
months among mothers age 15-19 to 73 months among mothers age 40-49. There is no marked difference in 
the length of the median birth interval by sex of the preceding birth. However, birth interval decreases with 
birth order. 
 58  •  Fertility 
The length of the birth interval is closely associated with the survival status of the previous sibling. 
The median birth interval is 25 months shorter when the previous sibling has died than when the previous 
sibling is still alive (28 and 54 months, respectively). The percentage of births occurring within a very short 
interval (less than 18 months) is almost eight times higher for children whose previous sibling died than for 
children whose previous sibling survived (23 and 3 percent, respectively). The shorter interval following the 
death of a child is partly due to a shortened period of breastfeeding (or no breastfeeding) for the preceding 
child, which leads to an earlier return of ovulation and hence increased chance of pregnancy. Minimal use 
of contraception, presumably because of a desire to have another child as soon as possible, could also be 
partly responsible for the shorter birth interval in these cases. 
Birth intervals are slightly longer in urban (56 months) than in rural (51 months) areas. There are 
marked differences in median birth intervals by administrative divisions. The median birth interval is longest 
in Khulna (64 months) and shortest in Sylhet (37 months). The median number of months since the preceding 
birth increases both with the mother’s education and the household’s wealth. The birth interval increases 
from 50 months among women with no education to 52 months among women with an incomplete secondary 
education and to 56 months among those with a complete secondary education or higher. Similarly, the 
median birth interval for the highest wealth quintile is nearly 5 years (59 months), whereas for the three 
lowest quintiles it is 52 months or less. 
A comparison with earlier BDHS surveys shows that the median birth interval has increased 
markedly, rising from 35 months in 1993-1994 to 44 months in 2007, to 47 months in 2011, and 52 months 
in 2014. Between 1993 and 2014, the median birth interval increased by 49 percent.

POSTPARTUM AMENORRHEA, ABSTINENCE, AND INSUSCEPTIBILITY 
Fertility levels in most populations can be explained by four key proximate determinants that affect 
a woman’s risk of becoming pregnant: nuptiality (including age at first marriage and age at first sexual 
intercourse); postpartum amenorrhea and sexual abstinence; menopause; and contraceptive use. Table 5.6 
addresses two principal factors that influence fertility. Postpartum amenorrhea and sexual abstinence affect 
the duration of a woman’s insusceptibility to pregnancy, which affects birth spacing. The onset of menopause 
marks the end of a woman’s reproductive life. These variables taken together determine the length and pace 
of a woman’s reproductive life, and therefore are important for understanding fertility levels and 
differentials.

 Fertility  •  59 
Postpartum amenorrhea is the interval between the birth of a child and the resumption of 
menstruation during which the risk of pregnancy is very low. Postpartum protection from conception can be 
influenced by the intensity and length of breastfeeding. Postpartum abstinence refers to the period of 
voluntary sexual inactivity after childbirth. Delaying the resumption of sexual relations after a birth prolongs 
the period of postpartum protection. A woman is considered insusceptible to pregnancy if she is not exposed 
to the risk of pregnancy either because she is amenorrheic or because she is abstaining from sexual 
intercourse following a birth. The duration of amenorrhea and sexual abstinence following birth jointly 
determine the length of insusceptibility. 
In the 2014 BDHS, information was obtained about the duration of amenorrhea and the duration of 
postpartum sexual abstinence for births in the three years preceding the survey. Table 5.6 shows that 
Bangladeshi women are amenorrheic for a median of 3.2 months, abstain for a median of 2.1 months, and 
are insusceptible to pregnancy for a median of 4.0 months. 
Almost all women (99 percent) are insusceptible to pregnancy during the first two months following 
childbirth. In general, the proportion of women who are amenorrheic or abstaining decreases as months after 
delivery increase. The proportion of women who are amenorrheic drops from 94 percent in the first two 
months after birth to a low of less than 2 percent at 30-35 months. The majority (89 percent) of Bangladeshi 
women abstain from sex during the first two months following a birth. The proportion abstaining drops 
sharply to 32 percent at 2 to 3 months and then drops to 9 percent at 4 to 5 months. The period of postpartum 
amenorrhea is considerably longer than the period of postpartum abstinence and is by far the major 
determinant of the length of postpartum insusceptibility to pregnancy. At 6 to 7 months after birth, more 
than one-fourth of all women are still amenorrheic, but only 9 percent are abstaining. At 16 to 17 months 
after birth, the proportion amenorrheic is 6 percent, while 10 percent of women are abstaining. 
A comparison of the 2014 BDHS with earlier BDHS surveys indicates that the duration of 
abstinence has remained constant since 1993-1994, possibly because of the Muslim tradition of abstaining 
for 40 days after birth. The median duration of postpartum amenorrhea has steadily decreased over time, 
from 10.3 months in 1993-1994 to 8.4 months in 1996-1997, 7.9 months in 1999-2000, 6.1 months in 2004, 
5.8 months in 2007, 4.3 months in 2011, and 3.2 months in 2014 (Mitra et al. 1994:77, Mitra et al. 1997:86; 
NIPORT et al. 2001:82; NIPORT et al. 2005:97; NIPORT et al. 2009:84; NIPORT et al. 2013:68). Similarly, 
there has been a slow and steady decline in the median duration of insusceptibility, from 10.8 months in 
1993-1994 to 6.5 months in 2004. Between 2004 and 2007 the median duration of insusceptibility did not 
change, but thereafter the duration of insusceptibility declined from 5.1 months in 2011 to 4.0 months in 
2014. 
Table 5.7 shows that the median duration of postpartum amenorrhea, abstinence, and 
insusceptibility varies little by background characteristics. The median duration of postpartum amenorrhea 
and postpartum insusceptibility are almost two months longer among women age 30-49 than among 
women age 15-29. Rural women have a shorter median duration of amenorrhea than urban women, and 
hence a shorter period of insusceptibility. There are substantial variations by administrative division for the 
period of insusceptibility. Postpartum insusceptibility ranges from 5.6 months among women in Sylhet to 
2.8 months in Rangpur, while the median among women in the other divisions ranges between 3.7 and 4.5 
months. The duration of postpartum amenorrhea is longer among women with no education than among 
women with some primary or secondary education. The median duration of postpartum amenorrhea and 
insusceptibility is shortest among women in the lowest quintile.

5.7 
MENOPAUSE 
The risk of becoming pregnant declines with age. After age 30, 
women’s susceptibility to pregnancy declines as an increasing proportion 
of women become infecund. The term infecundity denotes a process 
rather than a well-defined event. Although the onset of infecundity is 
difficult to determine for an individual woman, there are ways of 
estimating it for a group of women. One indicator of infecundity is the 
onset of menopause. Menopause is the culmination of a gradual decline 
in fecundity with increasing age. The 2014 BDHS defines menopausal 
women as women who are neither pregnant nor postpartum amenorrheic, 
but who have not had a menstrual period in the six months preceding the 
survey. Women who report that they have had a hysterectomy are also 
defined as menopausal. 
Table 5.8 shows that 23 percent of women age 30-49 are 
estimated to be menopausal. The proportion menopausal increases with age, from 8 percent among women 
age 30-34 to 68 percent among women age 48-49. The proportion of women age 30-49 who are menopausal 
increased from 20 percent in the 2011 BDHS to 23 percent in the 2014 BDHS.

AGE AT FIRST BIRTH 
Age at first birth has a direct effect on fertility. Early initiation of childbearing lengthens the 
reproductive period and subsequently increases fertility. In many countries, postponement of first births—
reflecting an increase in the age at marriage—has contributed greatly to overall fertility decline. Moreover, 
bearing children at a young age involves substantial risks to the health of both the mother and child. Early 
childbearing also tends to restrict educational and economic opportunities for women. 
Table 5.9 presents the percentage of all women who had given birth by specific ages for different 
age cohorts. The median age at first birth is not shown for young women age 15-19 because a large majority 
had not become mothers. The median age at first birth is about 18 years across all age cohorts, except for 
women age 20-24 and 25-29, whose median age at first birth is 19. The proportion of women who had a 
child before age 15 has decreased; 12 to 14 percent of women in their forties reported having had their first 
birth by age 15, compared with 4 percent of women age 15-19. Close to half of Bangladeshi women (48 
percent) have given birth before reaching age 18, while 70 percent have given birth by age 20. These findings 
are similar to those in the 2011 BDHS.

Table 5.10 summarizes the median age at first birth for 
different age cohorts by respondents’ background characteristics. 
Among women age 20-49, the median age at first birth is one year 
higher in urban areas than in rural areas. Among administrative 
divisions, it is highest in Sylhet (19.5 years). Women who have 
some secondary education start childbearing 1.1 years later than 
those with little or no education. Median age at first birth is more 
than two years higher for women age 25-29 in the highest wealth 
quintile (19.7 years), compared with those in the lowest wealth 
quintile (17.4 years). 
5.9 
TEENAGE PREGNANCY AND MOTHERHOOD 
Teenage pregnancy and motherhood is a major social 
and health concern. Early teenage pregnancy can cause serious 
health problems for both the mother and the child. The 2012 
Bangladesh Population Policy focused on a specific adolescent 
welfare program with an aim to increase awareness about family 
planning, reproductive health, STIs, and HIV/AIDS and to 
intensify information and counseling services (MOHFW 2012). 
Teenage mothers are more likely to suffer from severe 
complications during delivery, which result in high morbidity and 
mortality for both themselves and their children. In addition, 
young mothers may not be sufficiently emotionally mature to 
bear the burden of childbearing and rearing. Moreover, an early 
start to childbearing greatly reduces women’s educational and 
employment opportunities and is associated with higher levels of 
fertility. This hurts their job prospects, which often lowers their 
status in society. 
Table 5.11 shows that 31 percent of adolescents age 15-19 in Bangladesh have begun childbearing; 
one in four teenagers have given birth and another 6 percent are pregnant with their first child. As expected, 
the proportion of women age 15-19 who have begun childbearing rises rapidly with age, from 9 percent 
among women age 15 to 58 percent among women age 19. 
Early childbearing among teenagers is more common in rural than in urban areas (32 versus 27 
percent, respectively) and among women in Rajshahi and Rangpur divisions (37 percent each) compared 
with other divisions. Childbearing begins later in Sylhet than in other divisions. 
Delayed childbearing is strongly related to education among women age 15-19. Eighteen percent of 
teenagers who completed secondary or higher education in Bangladesh have begun childbearing compared 
with almost half of those with no education (48 percent). Childbearing begins earlier in the lowest wealth 
quintile: 41 percent of adolescents in this group have begun childbearing compared with 23 percent in the 
highest wealth quintile. 
The proportion of adolescents age 15-19 who have begun childbearing remained the same (33 
percent) in the 2004 and 2007 BDHS surveys (NIPORT et al. 2009:56). However, early childbearing among 
teenage women had slightly declined, to 30 percent in 2011, and remained almost the same in 2014 (NIPORT 
et al. 2013).

FERTILITY PREFERENCES

nformation on fertility preferences can improve understanding of future fertility patterns and demand for 
contraception. Fertility preferences are also used to construct measures of unmet need for contraception 
and of unwanted or mistimed births. Fertility preferences also help to assess the overall attitudes of 
women toward childbearing and the general course of fertility. Like previous BDHS surveys, the 2014 BDHS 
asked women a series of questions to ascertain their fertility preferences. The resulting data are used to 
quantify these preferences—whether couples want to cease childbearing altogether or merely delay the next 
pregnancy, for example. Data can also be used to determine the demand for family planning—combined 
with data on contraceptive use—to estimate unmet need for family planning, including the need for spacing 
and limiting births. The ideal number of children is another important indicator of fertility preferences that 
shows the number of children a woman would want if she could start her family anew. The information on 
ideal family size provides two measures. First, among women who have not yet started a family the data 
provide an idea of future fertility (to the extent that women are able to realize their fertility desires). Second, 
the excess of past fertility over ideal family size provides a measure of unwanted fertility. Other topics 
discussed in this chapter are fertility planning, the effect of unwanted births on fertility rates, and how fertility 
preferences between husband and wife differ. 
The interpretation of data on fertility preferences is often difficult because respondents’ reported 
preferences are, in a sense, hypothetical and thus subject to change and rationalization. Still, data on fertility 
preferences indicate the direction of future fertility to the extent that individuals and couples will act to 
achieve their preferred family sizes. 
6.1 
DESIRE FOR MORE CHILDREN 
Information about the desire for more children is important for understanding future reproductive 
behavior. The provision of adequate and accessible family planning services depends on the availability of 
such information. In the 2014 BDHS, currently married women (whether pregnant or not) were asked about 
their intentions to have another child and, if they had such intentions, how soon they wanted the child. The 
same question was phrased differently for pregnant women to ensure children after completion of the current 
pregnancy were wanted. Sterilized women and men were considered to want no more children, and therefore 
they were not asked questions about their desire for more children. Table 6.1 shows the percent distribution 
of currently married women by desire for another child, according to the number of living children. 
I
Key Findings 
• Sixty-three percent of currently married women in Bangladesh want to 
limit child bearing; 57 percent want no more children and 6 percent 
have been sterilized. The percentage who desire to limit family size 
declined slightly from 65 percent in 2011 to 63 percent in 2014. 
• The desire to stop childbearing among currently married women with 
two children has increased rapidly over the past decade, from 67 
percent in 2004 to 79 percent in 2014. 
• Since 2004, the mean ideal number of children has declined from 2.4 
children to 2.2 children in 2014. The figure remains unchanged since 
2011. 
• Bangladeshi women have 0.7 children more than they want. The total 
fertility rate would be 30 percent lower if unwanted births were avoided. 
The gap between wanted and actual fertility rates has narrowed over 
the years; from 1.0 children in 2004 to 0.7 children in 2014.

4 Includes both female and male sterilization 
 
 
Overall, 63 percent of married women age 15-49, including 6 percent who have been sterilized, do 
not want any more children. The proportion of women who want to stop childbearing or are sterilized 
increases rapidly with the number of living children, from 16 percent of women with one child to 79 percent 
of women with two living children, and over 90 percent of women with three or more children. On the other 
hand, the proportion of women who want to have another child decreases with the number of living children. 
More than three in four women with one living child want to have another child. The proportion of women 
who want to have another child declines sharply to 15 percent among women with two living children. Thus, 
the vast majority of married women want to either space their next birth or cease childbearing altogether. 
6.2 
DESIRE TO LIMIT CHILDBEARING 
The proportion of women who want no more children is an important and easily understood measure 
of fertility preference. Figure 6.1 shows that the proportion of currently married women who either want no 
more children or who have been sterilized increased from 59 percent in 2004 to 63 percent in 2014. However, 
there has been a slight decline in the proportion that desires to limit child bearing from 65 percent in 2011 
to 63 percent in 2014 (NIPORT et al. 2005).

Bangladesh’s National Population Policy promotes a two-child family norm, with a message that 
two chidren are enough, but one is better. Figure 6.2 shows that the percentage of currently married women 
with two children who want to have no more children increased by 12 percentage points in the last decade, 
from 67 percent in 2004 to 79 percent in 2014 (NIPORT et al. 2005). This trend is marked by a slight decline 
in the proportion desiring to limit childbearing between 2011 and 2014.  
Figure 6.2  Trends in currently married women with two children 
who want no more children, 1993-2014 
 
Table 6.2 shows, by number of living children, the percentage of currently married women who 
desire to stop childbearing by urban-rural residence, division, education, and household wealth. Overall, 
rural women are more likely than urban women to want no more children because they already have more 
children than urban women do. With three or more living children, women in urban and rural areas are 
equally likely to want no more children. With one or two living children, urban women are more likely than 
rural women to want no more children. For example, among women with two children, 83 percent of urban 
women want no more children compared with 78 percent of rural women. 
Overall, differences among women in their desire to limit childbearing are relatively small by 
administrative division. Two in three currently married women in Khulna, Rajshahi, and Rangpur do not 
want to have another child compared with three in five currently married women in Dhaka, Chittagong, and 
Sylhet. The desire to limit childbearing varies somewhat among currently married women with two children. 
For example, 64 percent of currently married women with two children in Sylhet do not want to have another 
child compared with 87 percent of women in Rangpur. 
There are major differences in women’s fertility preferences by level of education. Overall, the 
desire to limit childbearing is higher among women with no education than among women with education. 
For example, 81 percent of currently married women with no education want to stop childbearing compared 
with 46 percent of those who have completed secondary education. There are differences in the desire to 
limit childbearing by household wealth. Overall, the desire not to have any more children declines with 
wealth; women in the lowest wealth quintile are most likely to want no more children (69 percent) while 
women in the highest wealth quintile are least likely to want no more children (58 percent). The results by 
specific number of living children are less clear. At lower parities, however, women in the higher wealth 
quintiles are more likely to want no more children than women in the lower wealth quintiles.

6.3 
IDEAL FAMILY SIZE 
To assess ideal family size, women in the 2014 BDHS were asked two questions. Respondents 
without any living children were asked, “If you could choose exactly the number of children to have in your 
lifetime, how many would that be?” For respondents with living children, the question was rephrased as 
follows, “If you could go back to the time you did not have any children and could choose exactly the number 
of children to have in your lifetime, how many would that be?” Although these questions are based on 
hypothetical situations, they provide two measures. First, for women who have not yet started childbearing, 
the data provide an idea of future fertility. Second, for older and high parity women, the excess of past 
fertility over the ideal family size provides a measure of unwanted fertility.  
Women in Bangladesh prefer a small family size (2.2 children on average). Table 6.3 shows that 72 
percent of ever-married women consider a two-child family to be ideal, 13 percent prefer three children, 6 
percent prefer four children, and 1 percent prefers five or more children.  
There has been a decline in the mean ideal number of children among women since 2004. The 
women’s ideal number decreased by 0.1 in each survey, from 2.4 children in 2004 to 2.2 in 2011. This 
finding could explain the declining total fertility rates in the same period. However, the mean ideal number 
of children and the total fertility rate have remained constant since 2011. 
The ideal number of children increases with the number of living children. Women with six or more 
living children have an ideal family size of 3, compared with 2.0 for those with no children or one child. The 
positive association between actual and ideal number of children is due to two factors. First, to the extent 
that women are able to implement their fertility desires, women who want smaller families will tend to 
achieve smaller families. Second, some women may have difficulty admitting their desire for fewer children 
if they could begin childbearing again and may in fact report their actual number as their preferred number. 
Despite this tendency to rationalize, the data provide evidence of unwanted fertility, with the vast majority 
of women with three or more children reporting an ideal family size of fewer than their actual number of 
children.

Table 6.4 presents data on the mean ideal number 
of children for ever-married women age 15-49, by 
background characteristics. The ideal family size increases 
with age from 2.0 children for women age 15-19 to 2.5 
children for women age 45-49. Ideal family size is similar in 
rural areas and urban areas, and it is inversely related to the 
woman’s education and household wealth. Divisional 
variations in ideal family size are modest, ranging from 2.1 
in Khulna, Rajshahi, and Rangpur to 2.5 children in Sylhet. 
6.4 
FERTILITY PLANNING 
There are two ways of estimating levels of 
unwanted fertility from the BDHS data. One is based on 
women’s response to a question as to whether each birth in 
the five years preceding the survey was planned (wanted 
then), mistimed (wanted but at a later time), or unwanted 
(wanted no more children). These data are likely to result in 
underestimates of unplanned childbearing since women may 
rationalize unplanned births and declare them to be planned 
once the children are born. Another way of measuring 
unwanted fertility uses data on ideal family size to calculate 
what the total fertility rate would be if all unwanted births 
were avoided. This measure may also suffer from 
underestimation to the extent that women are unwilling to 
report an ideal family size lower than their actual family size. 
Estimates of unwanted fertility using both of these 
approaches are presented here. 
Interviewers asked women a series of questions regarding each child born in the five years preceding 
the survey and any current pregnancy to determine whether each birth or current pregnancy was wanted then, 
wanted later, or unwanted. These questions provide a powerful indicator of the degree to which couples 
successfully control fertility. Also, the data can be used to gauge the effect of preventing unwanted births on 
fertility rates.

Table 6.5 shows that almost three in four births in the five years before the survey were planned, 15 
percent were mistimed, and 11 percent were unwanted. The proportion of unwanted births decreased by 3 
percentage points from 14 percent in the 2007 BDHS, while the proportion of planned births increased from 
71 percent in 2007 to 74 percent in the same period. 
The proportion of wanted births decreases and the proportion of unwanted births increases with 
increasing birth order, a pattern similar to that found in previous surveys. Eighty-six percent of first-order 
births are wanted at the time they are conceived, but 26 percent of third-order births and 42 percent of fourth 
and higher-order births are not wanted at all. Mistimed births are most common among second-order births 
(21 percent); these births then decline with third- and fourth-order births. 
The proportion of planned births is highest (78 percent) among mothers who give birth before age 
20. Interestingly, mistimed births are also more common among younger mothers (under age 20) than among 
older mothers. The percentage of unwanted births increases with mother’s age at birth, rising from less than 
1 percent among women who became mothers before age 20 to 40 percent of those who were mothers at age 
35-39.

WANTED FERTILITY RATES 
The wanted fertility rate measures the potential demographic impact of avoiding unwanted births. 
It is calculated in the same manner as the total fertility rate but excludes unwanted births from the numerator. 
A birth is considered wanted if the number of living children at the time of conception is lower than the ideal 
number of children reported by the respondent. The gap between wanted and actual fertility shows how 
successful women are in achieving their reproductive goals. This measure may be an underestimate because 
women may not report an ideal family size lower than their actual family size. 
 
 
 Fertility Preferences   •  71 
The total wanted fertility rates (TWFR) in Table 
6.6 represent the levels of fertility that would have 
prevailed in the three years preceding the survey if all 
unwanted births had been avoided. Overall, the TWFR and 
the total fertility rate (TFR) for Bangladesh are 1.6 and 2.3 
children respectively. This implies that Bangladeshi 
women have 0.7 children more than their wanted number 
of children, and the TFR would be 30 percent lower if 
unwanted births were avoided. 
A wide gap exists between wanted and observed 
fertility rates by characteristics of women. The gap is wider 
among women who live in rural areas (0.7 children more 
than wanted) than among women who live in urban areas 
(0.5 children more). The gap is also wider among women 
residing in Sylhet (1.1 children) than women residing in 
Khulna (0.3 children). The gap between wanted and 
observed total fertility rates narrows with increasing 
education and wealth. Women with no education have 0.9 
children more than they want, compared with 0.3 children 
among women with a secondary or higher level of 
education. Similarly, the gap between wanted and actual 
fertility rates ranges from 0.4 children among women in the 
highest wealth quintile to 1.0 children among women in the 
lowest wealth quintile. 
The gap between wanted and actual fertility rates has narrowed over the years; from 1.0 children in 
2004 to 0.7 children in 2014 (Figure 6.3).

SPOUSAL AGREEMENT IN DESIRED NUMBER OF CHILDREN 
Currently married women who were not sterilized in the 2014 BDHS sample were asked, “Does 
your husband want the same number of children that you want, or does he want more or fewer than you 
want?” Responses to these questions are presented as spousal agreement in desired number of children in

Overall, four in five women report that their husbands want the same number of children as they do. 
Eleven percent of women say their husbands want more children than they want, and 7 percent say their 
husbands want fewer children. These figures remain almost unchanged since the 2011 BDHS. 
There are no urban or rural differences in spousal agreement in the desired number of children. 
Relatively small variations exist by education. Spousal agreement on the desired number of children tends 
to increase with household wealth, ranging from 76 percent among women in the lowest quintile to 81 
percent in the highest quintile. Spousal agreement in desired number of children by division varies little, 
ranging from 78 to 84 percent, except in Sylhet and Khulna where agreement is 73 percent and 76 percent, 
respectively.

amily planning is important for the health of a mother and her children, as well as for the family’s 
economic situation. Family planning and access to contraception reduce maternal and child deaths. 
The Health, Population and Nutrition Sector Development Program (HPNSDP) of Bangladesh 
adopted strategies for making family planning services available, accessible, acceptable, and affordable to 
all women and men of reproductive age to increase overall use of family planning to 72 percent by 2016 
(MOHFW 2011a; MOHFW 2011b). Moreover, according to the commitment of Family Planning 2020 this

Key Findings 
• Sixty-two percent of married women in Bangladesh use some method of 
contraception, and 54 percent use a modern method. Economic status 
does not appear to influence contraception use among couples. 
• Contraceptive use, while still increasing, is doing so at a slower pace. 
Between 2004 and 2014, use increased by 4 percentage points, from 58 
to 62 percent. In contrast, use increased 13 percentage points from 1994 
to 2004, rising from 45 percent to 58 percent. 
• Currently, the four most popular modern methods used by married 
women are the pill (27 percent), injectables (12 percent), the male 
condom (6 percent), and female sterilization (5 percent). 
• Only 8 percent of currently married couples use a long-acting reversible 
contraceptive (LARC) or permanent methods (PM), such as an IUD, 
implant, or sterilization. In the last 10 years use of LARC-PM increased 
by less than 1 percentage point.  
• Fourteen percent of currently married women have ever heard of the 
emergency contraceptive pill (ECP), 13 percent of them have ever used 
it, and 6 percent used it within the last 12 months. 
• Three in 10 users of contraception have discontinued a method within 12 
months of starting its use.  
• The government sector remains the major provider of contraceptive 
methods, catering to 49 percent of users, with government fieldworkers 
providing supplies to 20 percent of users. The private sector provides 
contraceptives to 47 percent of all users, with pharmacies supplying 38 
percent. The private sector share in providing family planning methods 
has increased from 43 in 2011 to 47 percent in 2014, while provision by 
the public sector has fallen by 3 percentage points. 
• Twelve percent of currently married women in Bangladesh have an 
unmet need for family planning services; 7 percent have an unmet need 
for limiting births, and 5 percent have an unmet need for spacing births. 
• Thirty percent of currently married women reported having seen/heard of 
a family planning message within the month prior to the survey. 
Television is the most popular source of family planning messages in 
Bangladesh, with 19 percent of women having seen a family planning 
message in this media. 
• Recent exposure to family planning messages continues to decline. In 
2004, 44 percent of currently married women reported having seen or 
heard family planning messages in the last month compared with only 30 
percent in 2014.

effort will be increased to 80 percent by 2021 (Family Planning 2020). Examining current levels, trends, and 
differentials of use of family planning will be useful for monitoring the progress of HPNSDP.  
This chapter presents results of contraceptive use and related information from the 2014 BDHS. Use 
of family planning is one of the primary determinants of family size. Information is presented on current use 
of contraceptives, use of socially marketed brands of pills and condoms, contraceptive discontinuation, 
unmet need for family planning, intention to use in the future, knowledge of fertile period, knowledge and 
use of menstrual regulation, contact with family planning workers, exposure to family planning messages in 
the media, and other issues associated with family planning. 
7.1 
CURRENT USE OF CONTRACEPTION 
In BDHS surveys, current use of contraception is defined as the proportion of currently married 
women who report that they are using a family planning method at the time of the survey. Overall, 62 percent 
of currently married Bangladeshi women age 15-49 are currently using a contraceptive method, and 54 
percent use modern methods (Table 7.1). The pill is by far the most widely used method (27 percent), 
followed by injectables (12 percent). Eight percent of currently married women use a long-acting or 
permanent method such as female or male sterilization, implants, and IUDs. Traditional methods are used 
by 8 percent of women, of which the majority (6 percent) use periodic abstinence. 
Current use of contraception varies by age, reaching a peak of 74 percent among women age 30-34, 
followed closely by women age 35-39 (73 percent). The oral pill is the most widely used method among all 
age groups except those age 45-49, who are more likely to use periodic abstinence. As expected, women in 
older groups (age 30-49) are more likely to be sterilized than younger women.

DIFFERENTIALS IN CURRENT USE OF FAMILY PLANNING 
Table 7.2 and Figure 7.1 show that contraceptive use varies by place of residence. Use of 
contraception is higher in urban (66 percent) than in rural areas (61 percent). With regard to method use, 
after oral pills, rural women are more likely to use injectables while urban couples prefer condoms. The 
contraceptive use rates are 63 percent or higher in all divisions except Chittagong (55 percent) and Sylhet 
(48 percent). According to FP 2020, these two divisions demand special focus to increase the use of 
contraceptives to 60 percent by 2021 (Family Planning 2020). In contrast, Rangpur and Rajshahi have the 
highest contraceptive use rates—almost 70 percent. 
There is a very little variation in contraceptive use by women’s education. Some variations in 
method choice are observed. Contraceptive pills are favored by women of all educational levels (between 
20 and 32 percent). Women with no education are more likely to use female sterilization and traditional 
methods than educated women. Condom use is most popular among women with secondary or higher 
education (19 percent). 
 Fertility Regulation  •  75 
There is no difference in contraceptive use levels between women in the lowest and highest wealth 
quintiles. There are some differences in method choice of women by wealth quintiles. Overall, injectable 
use declines and condom use increases as economic status, measured by wealth quintile, increases. For 
example, 18 percent of women in the lowest wealth quintile use injectables compared with 6 percent of those 
in the highest wealth quintile. Condom use is only 1 percent among couples in the lowest wealth quintile 
compared with 16 percent among those in the highest wealth quintile. In addition, the use of any long-acting 
and permanent methods of contraception declines as economic status increases.

7.3 
TRENDS IN CURRENT USE OF FAMILY PLANNING 
Use of contraception among married women in Bangladesh has increased gradually, from 8 percent 
in 1975 to 62 percent in 2014 (Table 7.3 and Figure 7.2). In the last decade, contraceptive use has increased 
by 4 percentage points from 58 percent in 2004 to 62 percent in 2014, while use of modern contraceptive 
methods increased by 7 percentage points from 47 percent to 54 percent during the same period. In the last 
three years, contraceptive use increased by 1 percentage point and modern methods use by 2 percentage 
points, while traditional methods use fell by 1 percentage point. Between 1991 and 2011 use of female 
sterilization among currently married women declined from 9 to 5 percent. Use of oral pills peaked in 2007 
(29 percent) and stayed at 27 percent in 2011 and 2014. Injectable use continued to increase from 7 percent 
in 2007, to 11 percent in 2011, and to 12 percent in 2014. The use of any long-acting and permanent methods 
of contraception increased by 1 percentage point between 2007 and 2011 and remained at 8 percent between 
2011 and 2014 (NIPORT et al. 2009; NIPORT et al. 2013). Male sterilization and implant usage show signs 
of increase between 2007 and 2014, although the current levels of use are very low at 1 percent and 2 percent, 
respectively. 
Figure 7.3 shows that the use of modern methods has increased between 2011 and 2014 in all age 
groups except age 40 and over. This is due to the decline in the use of permanent methods among women 
age 45-49 from 14 percent in 2011 to 7 percent in 2014. 
An increase of 10 percentage points would be needed to occur in the next two years, or an average 
of 5 percentage points per year, in order to achieve the HPNSDP goal of overall use of contraception by 72 
percent by 2016. The HPNSDP also focuses on reducing regional differences in contraceptive use, 
particularly in the low-performing divisions, Chittagong and Sylhet. For these divisions, the HPNSDP 
originally aimed to increase modern contraceptive use to 50 percent by 2016. In 2014 this indicator was reset 
to 40 percent for Sylhet division and 45 percent for Chittagong division (MOHFW 2014). Based on the 2014 
BDHS data, with a current prevalence of modern contraceptive use of 41 percent and 47 percent, 
respectively, Sylhet and Chittagong divisions have successfully reached the revised target. Between 2011 
and 2014, modern contraceptive method use in Chittagong increased by 2 percentage points and in Sylhet 
by 6 percentage points (Figure 7.4).

The method mix has also changed over the past two decades. Currently only 8 percent of married 
couples use a long-acting or permanent method (LAPM), namely sterilization, IUD, and implants, which 
account for 13 percent of all contraceptive use. Use of LAPM was 12 percent in 1991, accounting for 30 
percent of contraceptive use. Use of LAPM started to decline in the early 1990s, stabilized in 2007, hinted 
at a slight increase in 2011, and remained the same in 2014 (NIPORT et al. 2009; NIPORT et al. 2013). 
Since 2004 there has been a slow increase in the use of male sterilization and implants, although the usage 
rate of these methods remains very low. The plateauing of LAPM methods should be of concern, as fertility 
is now so low that most childbearing is completed by the mid- to late-twenties, and women face two 
subsequent decades of reproductive life during which they must protect themselves from unwanted 
pregnancies.

TIMING OF STERILIZATION 
Table 7.4 shows the distribution of sterilized women by the age at which they were sterilized, 
according to the number of years preceding the survey that the procedure was done. Because data on age at 
sterilization are derived from a question on the month and year of the operation, it is possible that the data 
are distorted by recall errors in reporting either the date of the operation or the date of birth or age of the 
woman. Women who decide to get sterilized generally undergo the procedure early in their reproductive 
years. Six in ten sterilized women had the procedure done before age 30, and about three in ten women were 
sterilized before age 25. The median age of sterilization is 28 years in the 2011 and 2014 BDHS (NIPORT 
et al. 2013).

KNOWLEDGE AND USE OF MENSTRUAL REGULATION 
Menstrual regulation (MR) is a procedure used to bring on menses in women who have missed their 
menstrual cycle. Existing polices of GOB allow a woman to go through MR procedure within the eight 
weeks from the first day of the last menstrual period (LMP) by a paramedic (that is, a trained family welfare 
visitor) or within ten weeks from the first day of the LMP by a trained medical doctor. The 2014 BDHS 
asked women if they knew about or had ever used menstrual regulation (MR). Women who have used MR 
were asked their source of services.

Table 7.5 shows that 45 percent of ever-married and 46 percent of currently married women know 
about MR. Among those who have ever heard of MR, 12 percent of ever-married and 13 percent of currently 
married women have ever used it. The use of MR increases among the ever-married and currently married 
women with the increase of age.

The major source of MR among the ever-married women 
who have used MR in the last three years is public sector facilities 
(48 percent), followed by private medical sector (33 percent) and 
NGO sector (6 percent) facilities (Table 7.6). Private hospitals/ 
clinics and upazila health complexes are the major sources of MR 
(22 percent each) followed by medical college hospital/district 
hospital (13 percent) and qualified doctor’s chamber (9 percent).

KNOWLEDGE OF FERTILE PERIOD 
An elementary understanding of reproductive physiology, 
particularly knowledge of when in the ovulatory cycle a woman is 
most likely to become pregnant, is necessary in ensure success in 
the use of coitus-related methods such as the withdrawal, condom, 
and vaginal methods. Such knowledge is especially critical for the 
practice of periodic abstinence. 
To investigate women’s knowledge about their fertile 
period, the 2014 BDHS respondents were asked whether there are 
certain days a woman is more likely to become pregnant if she has 
sexual intercourse. Those who responded affirmatively to that 
question were asked whether this time is just before the period begins, during the period, right after the 
period ends, or halfway between two periods. 
Table 7.7 presents knowledge of the fertile period during the ovulatory cycle of currently-married 
women according to current use and nonuse of periodic abstinence method. Forty-six percent of users and 
24 percent of nonusers of the abstinence method perceive halfway between two menstrual periods as the 
fertile period. Four in 10 of both users and nonusers of the abstinence method perceive the fertile period to 
be right after the menstrual period ends. However, about 3 in 10 women perceive the fertile period has no 
specific time (18 percent), or they do not know about the fertile period (11 percent).

KNOWLEDGE AND USE OF ECP 
The emergency contraceptive pill (ECP) is a form of contraception that women can use after 
unprotected intercourse. The 2014 BDHS asked women if they knew about or had ever used ECP. 
Fourteen percent of currently married women know about ECP (Table 7.8). Among those who have 
ever heard of ECP, 13 percent have ever used it and 6 percent used within the last 12 months. Awareness 
about ECP decreases with the increase of number of living children. Urban women are twice as likely as 
rural women to have heard of ECP. Awareness of ECP increases with increase in the woman’s education 
and wealth. Similar patterns are observed in the use of ECP.

KNOWLEDGE AND PRACTICE OF LACTATIONAL AMENORRHEA METHOD 
The lactational amenorrhea method (LAM) is a short-term family planning method based on the 
natural effect of breastfeeding on fertility. The act of breastfeeding, particularly exclusive breastfeeding, 
suppresses the release of hormones that are necessary for ovulation. Nine percent of currently married 
women know about LAM (Table 7.9). Among those who have ever heard of LAM, 21 percent reported 
having used it1. Awareness of LAM is higher among urban women (11 percent) than rural women (8 
percent). However, ever use of LAM is higher among rural women (23 percent) than urban women (16 
percent). Ever use of LAM is higher in Sylhet (30 percent) and Chittagong (27 percent) divisions, and among 
women in the lowest wealth quintile (24 percent).

SOURCES OF FAMILY PLANNING METHODS 
To ascertain the sources of family planning methods in Bangladesh, the 2014 BDHS asked women 
who were currently using a modern method of contraception where they obtained the method the last time 
they used it. Because women often do not know what category their source fits into (public hospital, upazila 
health complex, family welfare center, or private clinic), interviewers were instructed to write the name of 
the facility in the questionnaire. Team supervisors verified that the name and the type of source coded were 
correct and consistent. 
The sources of family planning methods are classified into four major categories: public-sector 
sources (including district hospital/medical college hospital, maternal and child welfare centers, upazila 
health complexes, family welfare centers, satellite/EPI clinics, community clinics, and government 
fieldworkers), private medical sources (including private hospitals and clinics, qualified or traditional 
                                                     
 
1 This is self-reported use of LAM, with no checks on whether the requirements for LAM use are fulfilled. 
 Fertility Regulation  •  83 
doctors, and pharmacies), NGO-sector sources (including static clinics, satellite clinics, depot holders, and 
fieldworkers), and other private sources (including shops and friends or relatives). 
Table 7.10 and Figure 7.6 show the percentage of current users of modern methods who obtained 
their method from a specific source. The table shows that 49 percent of modern contraceptive users obtained 
the method from the public sector, with 20 percent receiving the method from a government fieldworker. 
Overall, 43 percent of modern contraceptive users get their supplies from a private medical sector facility, 
with pharmacies being the most important source, serving 38 percent of users. Four percent of modern 
contraceptive users obtain their methods from a private non-medical source, mainly a shop (3 percent). 
Nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) supply contraceptives to 4 percent of users of modern methods. 
The source of modern contraceptive methods varies largely by the specific method. Upazila health 
complex (32 percent), private hospitals/clinics (29 percent), and medical college hospitals/district hospitals 
(23 percent) are the key sources for female sterilization. Male sterilization, the IUD, and implants are almost 
exclusively obtained from a public sector facility, particularly at upazila health complexes, medical college 
hospitals/district hospitals and family welfare centers. The private sector, namely pharmacies, is the major 
supply source of pills (48 percent), injectables (22 percent), and condoms (75 percent). The government 
fieldworker is also an important source of pills (29 percent), as well as injectables (21 percent). 
The SMC distributes the injectable brand SOMA-JECT through a network of private sector health 
providers called the Blue Star Program. Although information on the brand of injectables among the users 
was not collected in the 2014 BDHS, information in Table 7.10 can be used as proxy indicators to estimate 
the use of social marketing brands because the Blue Star Program is the only formal source of injectables in 
the private sector in Bangladesh. Table 7.10 shows that more than one-fifth of married women age 15-49  
who currently use injectables obtained the injection from either qualified doctor’s chambers or pharmacies, 
which are the sources of SOMA-JECT distribution. The supply source of injectables from pharmacies 
increased 8 percentage points during the last three years, which should be investigated by collecting the 
names of brands from respondents in the next BDHS.

Figure 7.6  Distribution of current users of modern methods by source of supply 
 
Figure 7.7 shows that the contribution of the public sector in providing modern family planning 
methods declined from 57 percent in 2004 to 49 percent in 2014. The contribution of the public sector 
declined mainly due to increased participation of the private sector in the family planning program. Between 
2004 and 2014, the contribution of the private sector as a source of contraceptive supply has increased 11 
percentage points, from 36 to 47 percent. The NGO-sector supply of contraceptives has decreased from 6 
percent in 2004 to 4 percent in 2014. 
Figure 7.7  Trends in source of contraceptive methods, 2004-2014 
 
The 2014 BDHS asked women who have never used family planning whether they know a source 
of services for family planning. Table 7.11 shows that 64 percent of never users know a public sector source, 
44 percent know a private medical sector source, and 12 percent know about an NGO source of family 
planning services. Twenty-six percent of never users do not know any source of family planning method.

7.10 USE OF SOCIAL MARKETING BRANDS 
Bangladesh has an active social marketing program that distributes family planning methods 
including pills, condoms, and injectables as well as other health and nutrition products such as oral 
rehydration salts (ORS), micronutrient powder, zinc tablets, sanitary napkins, and a safe delivery kit. These 
items are distributed through a network of retail outlets such as pharmacies, small shops, kiosks, a network 
of private health providers (Blue Star), and NGOs. The Social Marketing Company (SMC) currently carries 
several brands of oral contraceptives, including Femicon, Femipil, Noret-28, and the Progestin-only pill 
Minicon. Other oral pills, Combination-3 and Nordette-28, have been discontinued. Moreover, SMC is 
distributing IUDs and implants among a group of trained graduate physicians. 
To obtain information on the proportion of users purchasing the social marketing brands, the 2014 
BDHS interviewers asked current pill users to show the packet of pills they were using. If the user could 
show the packet, the interviewer recorded the brand on the questionnaire. If not, the interviewer showed the 
woman a chart depicting all major pill brands and asked the user to identify which brand she was currently 
using. 
As shown in Table 7.12, 44 percent of pill users use social marketing brands compared with 52 
percent who use Shuki, the government-supplied brand. Shuki is provided free of charge through government 
fieldworkers and clinics, and at a nominal charge through nongovernmental service providers. Three in ten 
pill users use Femicon, the most popular social marketing brand of pill. Femicon brand use is higher in urban 
(33 percent) than in rural (29 percent) areas. The next most widely used social marketing brand is Femipil 
(6 percent), with a small variation in the proportion of use between urban and rural areas. Minicon, a socially 
marketed progestin-only pill for lactating mothers, is used by 4 percent of pill users.

Note: Pill users who do not know the brand are excluded from

The percentage of pill users using a social 
marketing brand increased consistently from 14 percent in 
1993-94 to 45 percent in 2007, and then declined to 38 
percent in 2011. SMC pill brand use increased to 44 percent 
in 2014. The use of Femicon increased by four percentage 
points from 26 percent in 2011 to 30 percent in 2014 
(NIPORT et al. 2013). 
To assess the social marketing program’s reach in 
condom use, the 2014 BDHS gathered information on what 
type of condoms the couples used. Interviewers showed a 
chart depicting all major condom brands to women who 
reported that their husbands were currently using condoms. 
The women were asked to identify the brand used. Men 
would presumably be a more reliable source of data on 
condom brands; however, the data shown in Table 7.13 are 
derived from women. 
Three in five condom users buy social marketing 
brands; 23 percent use Panther, 17 percent use Sensation, 
11 percent use Hero, and 5 percent use U & ME. The Raja, 
Panther, Sensation, and U & ME brands are more popular 
in urban than rural areas, while Hero brand is more popular 
in rural areas. The percentage of condom users who obtain 
their supplies from the SMC has increased over the past three years, from 60 percent in 2011 to 62 percent 
in 2014 (NIPORT et al. 2013). 
7.11 CONTRACEPTIVE DISCONTINUATION 
A key concern for family planning programs is the rate at which users discontinue use of 
contraception and the reasons for such discontinuation. Life table contraceptive discontinuation rates are 
presented in Table 7.14. These rates are based on information collected in the 5-year, month-by-month

calendar of contraceptive use in the BDHS questionnaire. The analysis utilizes all episodes of contraceptive 
use from 3 to 62 months prior to the date of interview. The month of interview and the two preceding months 
are ignored to avoid the bias that might be introduced by an unrecognized pregnancy. 
The rates presented in Table 7.14 are cumulative one-year discontinuation rates and represent the 
proportion of users who discontinue using a method within 12 months of starting. The rates are calculated 
by dividing the number of discontinuations at each duration of use in single months, by the number of months 
of exposure for that duration. The single-month rates are then cumulated to produce a one-year rate.

Note: Figures are based on life table calculations using information on episodes of use that began 3-62 months prior to the survey. 
1 Male sterilization, IUD, and other methods are not included due to small number of cases (fewer than 125 episodes of use). 
2 Includes infrequent sex/husband away, difficult to get pregnant/menopausal, and marital dissolution/separation 
3 Includes lack of access/too far, costs too much, and inconvenient to use 
4 Reasons for discontinuation are mutually exclusive and add to the total given in this column 
5 The episodes of use included in this column are a subset of the discontinued episodes included in the discontinuation rate. A woman is considered to have 
switched to another method if she used a different method in the month following discontinuation or if she gave “wanted a more effective method” as the reason 
for discontinuation and started another method within two months of discontinuation. 
6 Number of episodes of use includes both episodes of use that were discontinued during the period of observation and episodes of use that were not 
discontinued during the period of observation 
 
 
The results indicate that about one-third users of contraceptive methods stop using the method 
within 12 months of starting. Not surprisingly, discontinuation rates are much higher for temporary methods 
like condoms (40 percent), pills (34 percent), and injectables (25 percent) than for long-term methods like 
the implants (7 percent). 
FP 2020 has set a target to reduce the discontinuation rate to 20 percent by 2021 (Family Planning 
2020). The all-method discontinuation rate has declined from 36 percent in 2011 to 30 percent in 2014. 
While the decline occurred for all methods in the past three years, it has been particularly large for 
withdrawal and periodic abstinence. Figure 7.8 shows that the all-method discontinuation rate has declined 
from 49 percent in 1993-94 to 30 percent in 2014.

Further information on reasons for contraceptive discontinuation is presented in Table 7.15. This 
table shows the percent distribution of all discontinuations occurring during the five years preceding the 
survey, regardless of whether they occurred during the first 12 months of use or not. The most common 
reason for discontinuation is the desire to become pregnant (31 percent), followed by side effects and health 
concerns, accounting for 26 percent of all discontinuations. The category of accidental pregnancies was cited 
as a reason for 14 percent of discontinuations.

There are variations in reasons for discontinuation by method. Side effects/health concerns is the 
most common reason for discontinuation of the injectables (46 percent), implant (51 percent), and IUD (47 
percent). Desire to become pregnant is the most common reason for discontinuing use of the pill (34 percent) 
and male condom (35 percent). This reason is also cited for periodic abstinence (26 percent), withdrawal (27 
percent), injectables (24 percent), implants (21 percent), and IUD (19 percent). Method failure (“became 
pregnant while using”) is the most common reason for discontinuation of periodic abstinence (19 percent), 
withdrawal (18 percent), and the pill (17 percent).

7.12 FUTURE USE OF CONTRACEPTION 
An important indicator of the changing demand for family planning is the extent to which nonusers 
of contraception plan to use family planning in the future. Currently married women who were not using 
contraception at the time of the survey—defined as nonusers—were asked about their intention to use family 
planning in the future. The results are presented in Table 7.16, according to the number of living children 
the women had. 
Overall, 58 percent of nonusers said they intended to use family planning methods and 39 percent 
said that they did not intend to use contraceptives. Only a few nonusers (3 percent) said they were unsure of 
their intention. Intention to use varies with the number of children. The proportion of nonusers who say they 
intend to use family planning in the future peaks at 78 percent for women with one child and falls sharply to 
27 percent among women with four or more children. Figure 7.9 shows the proportion of nonusers intending 
to use family planning in the future has been decreasing gradually from 73 percent in 2004 to 65 percent in 
2011 and to 58 percent in 2014. A further investigation is crucial to understand the reasons for decreasing 
trend of future intention to use contraception by the nonusers.

Another question assessed future demand for 
specific contraceptive methods among currently married 
women who were not using contraception but who said they 
intend to use a method in the future. They were asked which 
method they would prefer to use. The results are presented 
in Table 7.17. Close to half of the prospective users prefer 
the pill (49 percent) and 20 percent prefer injectables. One 
in five nonusers (21 percent) were unsure what method they 
wanted to use. 
7.13 REASONS FOR NOT INTENDING TO USE 
CONTRACEPTION 
Table 7.18 presents the main reasons for not 
intending to use contraception in the future as reported by 
nonintenders (nonusers who do not intend to use family 
planning in the future). Approximately eight in ten of the nonintenders do not plan to use family planning 
for reasons related to fertility. The most common reason for nonuse is menopause/hysterectomy, cited by 33 
percent of nonintenders, followed by those who are subfecund or infecund (27 percent). Sixteen percent of 
women do not intend to use a contraceptive method because of infrequent sex or no sex. Four percent of 
nonintenders, mostly women age 15-29, do not intend to use contraception because they want more children. 
Nine percent of married women do not intend to use because of method-related reasons, mainly 
health concerns and interfere with body’s normal process. Nine percent of nonintenders do not intend to use 
contraceptives because of opposition to family planning, either by themselves (6 percent), their husband (2 
percent) or because of religious prohibitions (1 percent).

7.14 UNMET NEED FOR FAMILY PLANNING SERVICES 
This section provides information on the extent of need and potential demand for family planning 
services in Bangladesh. In the past, the definition of unmet need used information from the contraceptive 
calendar and other questions that were not included in every survey leading to calculate inconsistent unmet 
need for family planning. The revised definition (Bradley et al. 2012) uses only information that has been 
collected in every survey so that unmet need can be measured in the same way over time. 
Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who are not using contraception but who 
wish to postpone the next birth (spacing) or stop childbearing altogether (limiting). Specifically, women are 
considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are: 
• 
At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become 
pregnant within the next two years, or are unsure if or when they want to become pregnant. 
• 
Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy. 
• 
Postpartum amenorrheic for up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using 
contraception. 
Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are: 
• 
At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children. 
• 
Pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy. 
• 
Postpartum amenorrheic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using 
contraception. 
Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming 
pregnant. 
Women using contraception are considered to have met need. Women using contraception who say 
they want no (more) children are considered to have met need for limiting, and women who are using 
contraception and say they want to delay having a child, or are unsure if or when they want a/another child, 
are considered to have met need for spacing. 
Unmet need, total demand, and percentage of demand satisfied by modern methods are defined as 
follows: 
• 
Unmet need: the sum of unmet need for spacing plus unmet need for limiting 
• 
Total demand for family planning: the sum of unmet need plus total contraceptive use 
• 
Percentage of demand satisfied: total contraceptive use divided by the sum of unmet need 
plus total contraceptive use 
Overall, 12 percent of currently married women in Bangladesh have an unmet need for family planning 
services, 5 percent have need for spacing, and 7 percent have need for limiting births (Table 7.19). The total 
demand for family planning (the sum of total unmet need and total contraceptive use) in Bangladesh is 74 
percent, of which 73 percent has been satisfied by the use of modern methods (modern contraceptive use 
divided by the sum of contraceptive use and total unmet need). 
Unmet need for family planning decreases with increasing age, from 17 percent among women age 
15-19 to 7 percent among women age 45-49. Women in rural areas have a higher unmet need than urban 
women (13 compared with 10 percent). Across divisions, unmet need is highest in Sylhet (18 percent) and 
Chittagong (17 percent), and the lowest in Rangpur (7 percent). 
 92  •  Fertility Regulation 
Unmet need for family planning in Bangladesh has decreased from 14 percent in 2011 to 12 percent 
in 2014 (Figure 7.10). The HPNSDP results framework has set a target to reduce unmet need for family 
planning services to 9 percent by 2016 (MOHFW 2011), and FP2020 has set a target to reach 7 percent by 
2021 (Family Planning 2020).

1 Unmet need for spacing: Includes women who are fecund and not using family planning and who say they want to wait two or more years for their next 
birth, or who say they are unsure whether they want another child, or who want another child but are unsure when to have the child. In addition, unmet 
need for spacing includes pregnant women whose current pregnancy was mistimed, or whose last pregnancy was unwanted but who now say they want 
more children. Unmet need for spacing also includes amenorrheic women whose last birth was mistimed, or whose last birth was unwanted but who now 
say they want more children. 
Unmet need for limiting: Includes women who are fecund and not using family planning and who say they do not want another child. In addition, unmet 
need for limiting includes pregnant women whose current pregnancy was unwanted but who now say they do not want more children or who are undecided 
whether they want another child. Unmet need for limiting also includes amenorrheic women whose last birth was unwanted but who now say they do not 
want more children or who are undecided whether they want another child. 
2 Using for spacing is defined as women who are using some method of family planning and say they want to have another child or are undecided whether
to have another. Using for limiting is defined as women who are using and who want no more children. Note that the specific methods used are not taken 
into account here. 
3 Nonusers who are pregnant or amenorrheic and whose pregnancy was the result of a contraceptive failure are not included in the category of unmet 
need, but are included in total demand for contraception (since they would have been using had their method not failed). They are also considered as 
having their demand satisfied. 
4 Primary complete is defined as completing grade 5. 
5 Secondary complete is defined as completing grade 10.

7.15 EXPOSURE TO FAMILY PLANNING MESSAGES 
The media play an important role in communicating messages about family planning. In assessing 
the reach of family planning messages, the 2014 BDHS asked women whether they had heard or seen a 
message about family planning on the radio, on television, in a newspaper or magazine, on a billboard, 
poster, or leaflet, or at a community event in the month before the survey. Table 7.20 presents the proportion 
of currently married women who had heard or seen such a message from a media source, by background 
characteristics.

Television is the most popular source for family planning messages in Bangladesh with 19 percent 
of currently married women age 15-49 having seen a family planning message in this media. Five percent 
of women saw a family planning message in either a poster, billboard, or leaflet, and 3 percent of women 
read about family planning in a newspaper or magazine. Overall, 80 percent of women were not exposed to 
family planning messages in any of the three main media (radio, television, and print media). 
Not surprisingly, women residing in urban areas are much more likely to have been exposed to 
family planning messages in any media than their rural counterparts. This is especially true for messages on 
television and in print media. Women residing in rural areas are more exposed to family planning messages 
through community health workers and radio than those living in urban areas. 
Education has a positive influence on media exposure. For example, 9 percent of uneducated women 
are exposed to family planning information on television compared with 39 percent of women with a 
secondary or higher education. Exposure to family planning messages increases with the increase in wealth. 
Exposure to family planning messages in the mass media for women age 15-49 has declined over 
the last three years. Exposure to family planning messages on the radio declined from 3 percent in the 2011 
BDHS to 1 percent in the 2014 BDHS, exposure through the television declined from 24 percent in 2011 to 
19 percent in 2014, and exposure through poster, billboard, or leaflet declined slightly from 6 percent in 
2011 to 5 percent in 2014 (NIPORT et al. 2013).

7.16 FIELDWORKER VISITS 
In the 2014 BDHS, women were asked whether a family planning fieldworker had visited them in 
the six months prior to the survey. Table 7.21 shows that 20 percent of currently married women said they 
were visited by a fieldworker in the six months before the survey. This proportion is 5 percentage points 
higher than that recorded in the 2011 BDHS. One-fourth of women visited by a fieldworker received a family 
planning method from the worker.

Eleven percent of currently-married women said they were visited by a government family planning 
fieldworker, while 4 percent were visited by a government health worker and 5 percent by an NGO 
fieldworker (Table 7.22). Married women who live in rural areas are twice as likely to be visited by a 
government fieldworker (both family planning and health workers) than women in urban areas.

7.17 SATELLITE CLINICS 
As shown in Table 7.23, 63 percent of ever-married women are aware of the existence of a satellite 
clinic in their community. Awareness of satellite clinics is lower among younger women, women in urban 
areas, women in Rajshahi, Rangpur and Sylhet divisions, women who completed secondary or higher 
education, and women in the highest wealth quintile. 
Seventeen percent of women who were aware of satellite clinics in their community reported visiting 
such a clinic in the three months before the 2011 BDHS. More than half of the women who visited a satellite 
clinic received immunization services for children, while one-fourth of women received family planning 
methods and 15 percent visited to obtain vitamin A for their children. Other reasons for visiting satellite 
clinics include receiving tetanus toxoid injections (5 percent), antenatal care services (3 percent), and child 
growth monitoring (3 percent).

7.18 COMMUNITY CLINICS 
The government of Bangladesh has planned to establish 13,861 community clinics in the rural areas. 
Each clinic is expected to provide health care services to a community of 6,000 population. As of 2014, 
12,527 community clinics are operating to provide health services (PMMU 2014). These clinics provide 
comprehensive primary health care, family planning services, and nutritional services from a single center. 
A question was asked of all ever-married women age 15-49 in the survey about whether their village 
or area has a community clinic, whether they visit that clinic, and if so, for what services. As shown in Table 
7.24, 28 percent of ever-married women are aware of the community clinic in their locality. Awareness of 
community clinics is lower among women in Dhaka, Sylhet, and Chittagong divisions and women with high 
wealth status. 
 
 
 98  •  Fertility Regulation 
Twenty-four percent of women who were aware of community clinics reported visiting such a clinic 
in the three months before the 2014 BDHS. Among these women, 62 percent visited the community clinic 
to obtain medicine for general health, 26 percent for family planning services, and 11 percent for 
immunization services for their children. Other reasons for visiting community clinics are insignificant: 
vitamin A for children (3 percent), tetanus toxoid injections (3 percent), antenatal care services (4 percent), 
and child growth monitoring (1 percent).

INFANT AND CHILD MORTALITY 
8
 
 
nfant and child mortality rates reflect a country’s level of socioeconomic development and quality of 
life. The rates are also useful in identifying promising directions for health and nutrition programs in 
any country. Mortality levels are one of the main indicators of the standard of living or development of 
a population. Thus, identifying segments of the child population that are at greater risk of dying contributes 
to efforts to improve child survival and lower the exposure of young children to risk. 
This chapter presents information on levels, trends, and differences in mortality among children 
under age 5 in Bangladesh. Specifically, it presents information on neonatal, postneonatal, infant, child, and 
under-5 mortality. Information on perinatal mortality and patterns of fertility associated with mortality is 
also presented. Mortality estimates are disaggregated by socioeconomic characteristics, such as urban-rural 
residence, geographic division, mother’s level of education, and household wealth, as well as selected 
demographic characteristics, which may be used to identify segments of the population requiring special 
attention. 
The data for mortality estimates were collected in the birth history section of the Woman’s 
Questionnaire. The 2014 BDHS asked all ever-married women age 15-49 to provide a complete history of 
their live births, including the sex, month, and year of each birth, survival status, and age at the time of the 
survey or age at death. Age at death was recorded in days for children dying in the first month of life, in 
months for children dying before their second birthday, and in years for children dying at later ages. This 
information is used to directly estimate the infant and child mortality rates1. 
 
 
                                                            
1 A detailed description of the method for calculating the probabilities presented here is given in Rutstein (1984).

Key Findings 
• Under-5 mortality for the five-year period before the survey is 46 deaths 
per 1,000 live births. At this level, Bangladesh has achieved the 
Millennium Development Goal 4 target—48 deaths per 1,000 live births 
by 2015—ahead of time. 
• The infant mortality rate for the five years preceding the survey is 38 
deaths per 1,000 live births. At this mortality level, 1 in 26 children in 
Bangladesh dies before reaching his or her first birthday. 
• Neonatal mortality, that is, deaths in the first month of life, is 28 per 1,000 
live births, and these deaths comprise 61 percent of all under-5 deaths. 
The neonatal mortality rate is nearly three times greater than 
postneonatal mortality. 
• In the last two decades under-5 and infant mortality declined by 65 
percent and 56 percent, respectively. Neonatal mortality declined by 46 
percent while postneonatal mortality fell by 71 percent. 
• The perinatal mortality rate is 44 deaths per 1,000 pregnancies. 
• Sylhet division has the highest under-5 mortality rate among all the 
divisions. 
 100  •  Infant and Child Mortality 
The mortality rates presented here are defined as follows: 
Neonatal mortality: 
the probability of dying within the first month of life 
Post-neonatal mortality: the difference between infant and neonatal mortality 
Infant mortality: 
the probability of dying before the first birthday 
Child mortality: 
the probability of dying between the first and fifth birthday 
Under-5 mortality: 
the probability of dying between birth and the fifth birthday 
All rates are expressed per 1,000 live births except for child mortality, which is expressed per 1,000 
children surviving to their first birthday (12 months of age). 
8.1 
ASSESSMENT OF DATA QUALITY 
The reliability of mortality estimates calculated from retrospective birth histories depends upon the 
extent to which birth dates and ages at death are accurately reported and recorded. Omission of either births 
or deaths is a serious problem since they affect the level of the mortality estimates. Errors in reporting of 
birth dates may cause a distortion of trends over time, while errors in reporting of age at death can distort 
the age pattern of mortality. 
Estimated rates of infant and child mortality are subject to both sampling and nonsampling errors. 
Sampling errors for various mortality estimates are provided in Appendix B, and this section describes the 
results of various checks for nonsampling errors—in particular, underreporting of deaths in early childhood 
(which would result in an underestimate of mortality) and misreporting of the date of birth or age at death 
(which could distort the age pattern of under-5 mortality). Both problems are likely to be more pronounced 
for children born further in the past than for children born recently. Underreporting of infant deaths is usually 
most serious for deaths that occur very early in infancy. If deaths in the early neonatal period are selectively 
underreported, there will be an abnormally low ratio of deaths during the first seven days of life to all 
neonatal deaths and an abnormally low ratio of neonatal to infant mortality. Changes in these ratios over 
time can be examined to test the hypothesis that underreporting of early infant deaths is more common for 
births that occurred further in the past than for births that occurred more recently. Failure to report deaths 
will result in mortality figures that are low, and if underreporting is more severe for children born longer ago 
than for children born recently, any decrease in mortality will tend to be understated. 
Results from Appendix Table C.5 suggest that early neonatal deaths have not been seriously 
underreported in the 2014 BDHS because the ratios of deaths under seven days to all neonatal deaths are 
acceptable. For 0 to 19 years before the survey, the overall percentage of neonatal deaths occurring during 
the first week of life is 76 percent. A ratio of about 70 percent is often considered normal.2 This percentage 
decreases somewhat with increasing years before the survey, from 81 percent of neonatal deaths for the 
periods 0 to 4 years preceding the survey to 76 percent for the period 15 to 19 years preceding the survey. 
The ratios of neonatal to infant deaths (Appendix Table C.6) are also consistently high (between 65 percent 
and 75 percent) for the various periods preceding the survey. 
Another problem inherent in most retrospective surveys is heaping of age at death on certain digits 
(for example, 6, 12, and 18 months). If the net result of misreporting is the transference of deaths between 
age segments for which the rates are calculated, misreporting of the age at death will bias estimates of the 
age pattern of mortality. For instance, an overestimate of child mortality relative to infant mortality may 
result if children dying during the first year of life are reported as having died at age 1 or older. Thus, heaping 
at 12 months can bias the mortality estimates because a certain fraction of these deaths, which are reported 
to have occurred after infancy (i.e., at age 12-23 months), may have actually occurred during infancy (i.e., 
                                                            
2 There are no models for mortality patterns during the neonatal period. However, one review of data from developing 
countries concluded that at a neonatal mortality of 20 per 1,000 or higher, approximately 70 percent of neonatal deaths 
occur within the first six days of life (Boerma 1988). 
 Infant and Child Mortality  •  101 
at age 0-11 months). In such cases, heaping would bias infant mortality (1q0) downward and child mortality 
(4q1) upward. 
In the 2014 BDHS, there appears to be a preference for reporting age at death at 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 18, 
and 21 days (Appendix Table C.5). An examination of the distribution of deaths under age 2 during the 19 
years preceding the survey by month of death (Appendix Table C.6) indicates some heaping of deaths at 3, 
5, 8, 12, and 18 months of age. Some heaping on 12 months and recording of deaths at “1 year” is found 
despite the strong emphasis on this problem during the training of interviewers for the BDHS fieldwork.3 
However, this brief assessment of the internal consistency of childhood mortality data suggests that the 
extent of digit preference is such that it will not substantially alter the rates. 
Appendix Table C.4 can be used to assess the quality of information recorded on date of birth. The 
results show that there was evidence of shifting in the reporting of births from calendar year 2009 to 2008. 
This shifting usually results from interviewers transferring births out of the five-year period for which child 
data are collected on maternal and child health indicators (January 2009 to date of interview for the 2014 
BDHS) in an attempt to reduce the length of the interview. The data also show that transference is 
proportionately higher for dead children than for living children, which may underestimate the true level of 
childhood mortality rates for the five-year period before the survey. 
It is seldom possible to establish mortality levels with confidence for a period of more than 15 years 
before a survey. Even within the recent 15-year period considered here, apparent trends in mortality rates 
should be interpreted with caution for several reasons. First, there may be differences in the completeness of 
death reporting related to the length of time before the survey. Second, the accuracy of reports of age at death 
and of date of birth may deteriorate with time. Third, sampling variability of mortality rates tends to be high, 
especially for groups with relatively few births. Fourth, mortality rates are truncated as they go back in time 
because women currently age 50 or older who were bearing children during earlier periods were not included 
in the survey. This truncation affects mortality trends in particular. For example, for the period 10 to 14 years 
before the survey, the rates do not include any births to women age 40-49 because these women were over 
age 50 at the time of the survey and therefore not eligible to be interviewed. Because these older women 
were likely to have a somewhat greater risk of dying than younger women, the mortality rates for the period 
may be slightly underestimated. Estimates for more recent periods are less affected by truncation bias 
because fewer older women are excluded. However, the extent of this bias depends on the proportion of 
births omitted. 
8.2 
LEVELS AND TRENDS IN INFANT AND CHILD MORTALITY 
Mortality rates for children under age 5 are presented in Table 8.1 for the three five-year periods 
preceding the survey. Data from the 2014 BDHS shows that under-5 mortality in the five years preceding 
the survey (which corresponds approximately to the calendar years 2010-2014) is 46 deaths per 1,000 live 
births. This means Bangladesh already has achieved Millennium Development Goal 4, an under-5 mortality 
target of 48 deaths per 1,000 births. 
The infant mortality rate is 38 deaths per 1,000 live births, and the child mortality rate is 8 deaths 
per 1,000 children. During infancy, the risk of dying in the first month of life (28 deaths per 1,000 live births) 
is nearly three times greater than in the subsequent 11 months (10 deaths per 1,000 live births). It is also 
notable that deaths in the neonatal period account for 61 percent of all under-5 deaths.

as “1 year.”

Trends in Childhood Mortality 
Another approach to looking at trends in mortality levels compares estimates from surveys 
conducted at different points in time. Since 1993-1994 the DHS surveys in Bangladesh have obtained 
childhood mortality rates for the five-year period preceding the survey. In examining the estimates, it is 
important to remember that the reporting of mortality events is generally better for the five-year period 
immediately before a survey since mothers are more likely to forget or fail to mention deaths further back in 
time. Thus the estimate for the five-year period immediately prior to each of the surveys in shown in Table 
8.2 is likely to be the most accurate. 
Over the last two decades, the data confirm a steady downward trend in childhood mortality (Table 
8.2 and Figure 8.1). A Bangladeshi child was around three times more likely to die before reaching his/her 
fifth birthday in the early-1990s than in 2014. As the overall rates have decreased, mortality has become 
increasingly concentrated in the earliest months of life. Between the 1989-1993 and 2010-2014 periods, 
infant mortality declined by 56 percent, from 87 to 38 deaths per 1,000 live births. An almost 20 percent 
further reduction in infant mortality is needed to achieve the Health, Population, and Nutrition Sector 
Development Program (HPNSDP) target of 31 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2016 (MOHFW 2011a). 
The corresponding decline in postneonatal mortality was even more impressive. There was a 71 
percent decline from 35 deaths per 1,000 live births in 1989-1993 to 10 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2010-
2014 and a 65 percent decline in under-5 mortality from 133 to 46 deaths per 1,000 live births over the same 
period. 
Comparison of neonatal, infant, and under-5 mortality rates in Bangladesh over the last 20 years 
reveals that neonatal mortality declined at a slower pace than infant and child mortality, with the result that 
neonatal deaths have changed from 60 percent of all infant deaths in 1993-1994 to 74 percent in 2010-2014. 
The decline in childhood mortality continues, but at the current pace, it would be difficult to achieve the 
HPNSDP target of 21 neonatal deaths per 1,000 live births for the neonatal mortality rate by 2016 (MOHFW 
2011b).

SOCIOECONOMIC DIFFERENTIALS IN INFANT AND CHILD MORTALITY 
Selected socioeconomic and demographic differentials in early childhood mortality for the five 
years preceding the survey are presented in Table 8.3 and Figure 8.2. These findings must be interpreted 
with caution given the low precision of mortality estimates due to sampling error.

 104  •  Infant and Child Mortality 
Table 8.3 shows that urban-rural differences in early childhood mortality favor urban children who 
have a lower probability of dying at any stage of early childhood than rural children. Under-5 mortality in 
urban areas is 37 per 1,000 live births, 24 percent lower than in rural areas (49 per 1,000). Between 2011 
and 2014, mortality rates among children under age 5 have declined faster in urban areas than in rural areas. 
For example, the infant mortality rate has declined 21 percent in urban areas and 7 percent in rural areas 
(NIPORT et al. 2013), increasing the urban-rural gap in childhood mortality rates from 5 to 12 deaths per 
1,000 live births. 
The 2014 BDHS data show wide variations in estimates of childhood mortality by division. In 
general, Sylhet has the highest rates and Barisal has the lowest rates. For instance, the under-5 mortality rate 
is 67 deaths per 1,000 births in Sylhet and 35 deaths per 1,000 births in Barisal. The infant mortality rate is 
55 deaths per 1,000 live births in Sylhet and 26 deaths per 1,000 live births in Barisal. The child mortality 
rate, however, is highest in Chittagong (14 deaths per 1,000 births). 
Mother’s level of education is inversely related to her child’s risk of dying. Higher levels of 
educational attainment are generally associated with lower mortality risks because education exposes 
mothers to information about better nutrition, use of contraception to limit and space births, health care 
during pregnancy, and childhood illness, vaccinations, and treatments. The 2014 BDHS shows that children 
born to women who never attended school are almost twice as likely to die by the fifth birthday compared 
with children born to mothers with a secondary complete or higher education (50 and 27 deaths per 1,000 
live births, respectively). 
Figure 8.2  Under-5 mortality rates by socioeconomic characteristics 
 
Similarly, a child’s risk of dying is associated with the economic status of the household. All 
childhood mortality rates, except the postneonatal mortality rate, are lowest for births to mothers in the 
highest wealth quintile. For instance, for mothers in the highest wealth quintile, the risk of a child dying by 
age 5 is 30 deaths per 1,000 live births. This compares with 53 deaths per 1,000 live births to mothers in the 
lowest quintile. For all childhood mortality, the rates are highest among children in the second wealth 
quintile. 
8.4 
DEMOGRAPHIC DIFFERENTIALS IN INFANT AND CHILD MORTALITY 
This section examines the pattern of mortality rates by demographic variables, which correlate with 
levels of infant and child death. Table 8.4 and Figure 8.3 show the relationship between early childhood 
mortality and selected demographic variables, including the sex of the child, mother’s age at birth, birth 
order, length of previous birth intervals, and mother’s perception concerning the size of the child at birth.

As expected, neonatal mortality is higher among boys than girls (31 deaths and 26 deaths per 1,000 
live births, respectively) as by nature from the time of conception, boy babies are more vulnerable than girl 
babies. All other mortality rates, except neonatal mortality, are higher for girls than for boys. With the 
exception of the 2004 and 2007 BDHS, all BDHS surveys reported both higher postneonatal and child 
mortality for girls than for boys—a pattern that has been observed in other countries of South Asia where 
strong son preference is thought to result in relative nutritional and medical neglect of girl children (Das 
Gupta 1987; Basu 1989). The 2014 BDHS indicates that under-5 mortality is 9 percent higher in girls than 
boys (48 deaths and 44 deaths per 1,000 live births respectively). 
 106  •  Infant and Child Mortality 
Figure 8.3  Under-5 mortality rates by demographic characteristics 
 
The relationship between mother’s age at birth and childhood mortality rates exhibits a U-shaped 
pattern—children of both the youngest and the oldest mothers experience the highest mortality risks. The 
2014 BDHS shows a similar pattern for all mortality estimates except for child mortality rates. Neonatal and 
infant mortality rates also have a U-shaped relationship with birth order. The effect of older maternal age at 
birth on mortality is evident in Table 8.4. 
There is no clear relationship between birth order and childhood mortality. It seems to show a U-
shaped pattern. But the relationship of birth order and child mortality shows an inverted U pattern; 16 deaths 
per 1,000 live births among children in the birth order category of 4-6 births and 4-7 deaths per 1,000 live 
births among other order births. 
The length of the previous birth interval is associated with mortality levels. Retherford and others 
(1989) observed increased mortality among births taking place fewer than two years after a previous birth, 
even after controlling for other demographic and socioeconomic variables. As shown in Table 8.4, all 
childhood mortality rates are lower at birth intervals of two years or more. The child mortality rate among 
children born fewer than two years after a previous birth is 16 deaths per 1,000 live births compared with 6 
deaths among children born after an interval of four or more years. 
Studies have shown that children’s birth weight is an important determinant of their survival 
(UNICEF and WHO, 2004). Data on birth weight are not available in the 2014 BDHS. However, mothers in 
the 2014 BDHS were asked whether, according to their perception, their child was very large, larger than 
average, average, smaller than average, or very small at birth. This perception has been found to be a good 
proxy for a child’s weight. For example, infant mortality for children considered by their mothers to be small 
or very small is 46 deaths per 1,000 live births compared with 37 deaths per 1,000 live births for children 
regarded as average or larger size at birth. This gap appears to be due to higher infant mortality among 
small/very small children than among babies of average or larger size. 
8.5 
PERINATAL MORTALITY 
Perinatal deaths are those caused by pregnancy losses occurring after seven completed months of 
gestation (stillbirths) and those deaths within the first seven days of life (early neonatal deaths). The perinatal 
mortality rate is calculated by dividing the total number of perinatal deaths by the total number of 
pregnancies reaching seven months of gestation. The distinction between a stillbirth and an early neonatal

death is a delicate one, often depending on the observed presence or absence of some signs of life after 
delivery. The causes of stillbirths and early neonatal deaths overlap, and examining just one or the other can 
understate the true level of mortality around delivery. For these reasons, it is suggested that both events be 
combined and examined together. In the 2014 BDHS, information on stillbirths is available for the five years 
preceding the survey and is collected using the calendar at the end of the Woman’s Questionnaire.

Table 8.5 presents the number of stillbirths, early neonatal deaths, and the perinatal mortality rate 
for the five-year period prior to the 2014 BDHS by selected background characteristics. The perinatal 
mortality rate in Bangladesh is 44 deaths per 1,000 pregnancies. Perinatal mortality is higher among mothers 
age 30 or older. Perinatal mortality in rural areas is 34 percent higher than in urban areas (47 and 35 per 
1,000 pregnancies in rural and urban areas, respectively). Among divisions, Sylhet has the highest perinatal 
mortality rate. Perinatal mortality is highest in first pregnancy (51 deaths per 1,000 pregnancies). Overall, 
perinatal mortality has a negative association with the mother’s education and wealth status; that is, it is 
lowest for women who have completed secondary or higher education and for women in the highest wealth 
quintile.

8.6 
HIGH-RISK FERTILITY BEHAVIOR 
Numerous studies have found a strong relationship between maternal fertility patterns and children’s 
survival risks. Typically, the probability of dying in early childhood is much greater if children are born to 
mothers who are too young or too old, if they are born after a short birth interval, or if they are born to 
mothers with high parity. Very young mothers may experience difficult pregnancies and deliveries because 
of their physical immaturity. To the contrary, older women may also experience age-related problems during 
pregnancy and delivery. For this analysis, a mother is classified as ‘too young’ if she is less than 18 and ‘too 
old’ if she is over age 34 at the time of delivery. A ‘short birth interval’ is defined as a birth occurring within 
24 months of a previous birth. A child is of ‘high birth order’ if the mother had previously given birth to 
three or more children (i.e., the child is of birth order four or higher). Short succeeding birth intervals are not 
included, even though they can influence the survivorship of a child, because of the problem of reverse 
causal effect (i.e., a short succeeding birth interval can be the result of the death of a child rather than being 
the cause of the death of a child). A birth may have from zero to three high-risk characteristics. All risk 
categories are potentially avoidable except for first order births to mothers age 18-34.

1 Women are assigned to risk categories according to the status they would have at the 
birth of a child if they were to conceive at the time of the survey: current age less than 17 
years and 3 months or older than 34 years and 2 months, latest birth less than 15 months 
ago, or latest birth being of order 3 or higher. 
2 Includes the category age <18 and birth order >3 
 
 
Table 8.6 shows the percent distribution of births in the five-year period before the survey and of 
currently married women at the time of the survey according to these elevated risk factors. The table also 
examines the relative risk of dying for children by comparing the proportion dead in each specified high-
risk category with the proportion dead among children not in any high-risk category. First births, although 
often at increased risk, are included in the ‘not in any high-risk’ category in this analysis, because they are

not considered an avoidable risk. The purpose of this table is to identify areas in which changes in 
reproductive behavior would be likely to reduce infant and child mortality. Mortality risk is represented by 
the proportion of children born during the five years preceding the survey who had died by the time of the 
survey. 
Among children born in the five years preceding the survey, 39 percent are not in any high-risk 
category, and 37 percent are in an avoidable high-risk category. Of those avoidable, 31 percent are in a single 
high-risk category, and 5 percent are in a multiple high-risk category. Births to women between ages 18 and 
34 (24 percent) fall in the category of unavoidable risk. In the single risk category, 15 percent of births are 
associated with the mother’s young age (younger than 18 years) and 11 percent are a birth order of three or 
higher. 
Risk ratios, which describe the relationship between a particular risk category and a reference 
category, are used to compare mortality by risk category. A child who falls into any of the elevated mortality 
risk categories is 1.12 times more likely to die than a child who does not fall in any high-risk category. If the 
risk categories are viewed separately, children’s risk of dying is 1.7 times higher if the mother’s age is more 
than 34 years at the time of birth. The risk of dying is 1.19 times higher if the child is born within two years 
of a previous birth. However, only 4 percent of the births fall in this category. Children are 1.11 times more 
likely to die when their mother’s age at birth is over 34 years and the birth order is more than three. 
The last column in Table 8.6 presents the distribution of currently married women by category of 
increased risk if they were to conceive at the time of the survey. Although many women are protected from 
pregnancy due to use of family planning, postpartum insusceptibility, and prolonged abstinence, for the sake 
of simplicity, only those who have been sterilized are included in the ‘not in any high-risk’ category. The 
criteria for placing women into specific risk categories are adjusted to take into account the gestation time 
for an additional birth. 
The 2014 BDHS results indicate that 58 percent of currently married women in Bangladesh who 
have given birth in the five years preceding the survey have the potential of giving birth to a child who is in 
an avoidable high-risk category of mortality. Thirty percent are in a single high-risk category, and 27 percent 
have the potential for having a birth in a multiple high-risk category. Thirty-five percent of the women are 
not at any elevated risk of mortality.

 health care system striving to reduce morbidity and mortality related to pregnancy must focus on 
maternal and newborn health. The health care that a woman receives during pregnancy, at the time 
of delivery, and soon after delivery is important for the survival and well-being of both the mother 
and the child. The government of Bangladesh is committed to achieving the target for Millennium 
Development Goal (MDG) 4 and MDG 5. The BMMS 2010 (NIPORT et al., 2011) indicated a substantial 
reduction in the maternal mortality ratio (MMR), an annual rate of decrease of 5.6 percent. The MMR fell 
from 322 deaths per 100,000 live births (or between 253 and 391 at 95 percent confidence interval [CI]) in 
1998-2001 to 194 deaths per 100,000 live births (149 to 238 at 95 percent CI) in 2007-2010, indicating a 
degree of success in the health sector. Moreover, Bangladesh has set targets to achieve the goal of the Health, 
Population and Nutrition Sector Development Program (HPNSDP) to reduce MMR to less than 143 deaths 
per 100,000 live births and to reduce the under-five mortality rate from 146 deaths per 1,000 live births in 
1990 to 48 deaths per 1,000 live births by 2016. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW) has

Key Findings 
• Sixty-four percent of women who gave birth in the three years preceding 
the survey received antenatal care from a medically trained provider, up 
from 55 percent in 2011. This increase is mainly due to an increase in 
ANC from a qualified doctor. 
• Thirty-one percent of women have four or more antenatal care visits 
during the course of pregnancy, an improvement from about one in every 
four (26 percent) in 2011. 
• Forty-two percent of births in the past three years were assisted by a 
medically trained provider. The percentage of births attended by a skilled 
provider has increased 2.6 times since 2004 due to the increase in 
deliveries at medical facilities. The national health sector program aims to 
have 50 percent of all deliveries made by a skilled birth attendant. 
• Thirty-seven percent of births in the past three years were delivered in a 
health facility. 
• Bangladesh aims to reduce inequity in the use of maternal health 
services. In 2014,15 percent of deliveries among women in the lowest 
wealth quintile occurred in a facility compared with 70 percent of 
deliveries among women in the highest wealth quintile. 
• Twenty-three percent of all births were delivered by C-section. Among 
births delivered in a health facility, 61 percent were delivered by C-
section. 
• In the three years before the survey, 36 percent of women received 
postnatal care for their last birth from a medically trained provider within 
two days of their delivery, up from 27 percent in 2011. 
• Newborn care practices have improved considerably since 2007 in 
Bangladesh. Among non-institutional births in the three years preceding 
the survey, the use of boiled instruments to cut the umbilical cord has 
increased from 62 percent in 2007 to 83 percent in 2014. The practice of 
drying within five minutes of birth has also increased from 6 percent in 
2007 to 67 percent in 2014. The practice of waiting at least 72 hours after 
birth to bathe the newborn is more common in 2014 than it was in 2007, 
having increased from 17 percent to 34 percent. 
 112  •  Maternal and Newborn Health 
developed various policies and strategies to improve maternal and newborn health. With a strong emphasis 
on improving access and equity in the use of essential maternal and neonatal services, the MOHFW is 
implementing the program through two operational plans of HPNSDP under the Directorate General of 
Health Services and the Directorate General of Family Planning (MOHFW 2011). 
This chapter provides information from the 2014 BDHS on several aspects of maternal and newborn 
health, including antenatal care, delivery, postnatal care, and newborn care. In the 2014 BDHS, women who 
had given birth in the three years preceding the survey were asked a number of questions about maternal and 
child health care. For the last live birth in that period, mothers were asked whether they had received 
antenatal care during pregnancy and whether they had sought postnatal care for themselves and their 
children. Information was also collected on the place of delivery and on attendance at birth for all births in 
the three years preceding the survey. In addition, questions on newborn care, including cord cutting, drying, 
and bathing of the newborn following birth, were asked about the most recent live birth in the three years 
preceding the survey. 
Tables in this chapter present findings from the most recent pregnancies and births in the three years 
preceding the survey. To allow for comparison with data from previous surveys, data from the 2004, 2007, 
and 2011 BDHS reports have been re-tabulated to include births in the three years preceding the surveys. 
This information will assist planners and other collaborators in the health sector to formulate appropriate 
strategies and interventions to provide good-quality health services and a series of well-timed interventions 
that should further improve maternal and newborn health. 
9.1 
ANTENATAL CARE 
Antenatal care (ANC) from a medically trained provider is important to monitor the status of a 
pregnancy, identify the complications associated with the pregnancy, and prevent adverse pregnancy 
outcomes. To be most effective, there should be regular ANC throughout pregnancy. Information on ANC 
was assessed for women who gave birth in the three years preceding the survey. Among women with two or 
more live births during the three-year period, data refer to the most recent live birth only. 
9.1.1 Antenatal Care Coverage 
Table 9.1 shows the percent distribution of mothers with a live birth, by source of antenatal care 
received during pregnancy. Women were asked to report on all persons they saw for ANC for their last birth. 
However, if a woman saw more than one provider, only the provider with the highest qualifications was 
considered in the tabulation of results. 
Seventy-eight percent of women with a birth in the three years preceding the survey received 
antenatal care at least once from a provider. About two-thirds of women (64 percent) received ANC from a 
medically trained provider, that is, a qualified doctor, nurse, midwife, paramedic, family welfare visitor 
(FWV), community skilled birth attendant (CSBA), or sub-assistant community medical officer (SACMO). 
Younger women, women with a lower birth order, and women who live in urban areas are more likely to 
receive ANC from a trained provider compared with other women. Women in Khulna are most likely to 
receive ANC from a medically trained provider (74 percent), while women in Sylhet are least likely (53 
percent). The likelihood of receiving ANC from a medically trained provider increases with women’s 
education level and wealth status. For example, coverage of ANC from a trained provider ranges from 36 
percent for women in the lowest wealth quintile to 90 percent for women in the highest quintile. In the last 
three years, the huge gap in use of ANC from a trained provider between the richest and the poorest women 
has declined only slightly, from 57 percentage points in 2011 to 54 percentage points in 2014 (NIPORT et 
al. 2013).

Figure 9.1 shows that coverage of antenatal care for births in the three years preceding the surveys 
has increased substantially from 58 percent in 2004 to 78 percent in 2014. During the same period, ANC 
from a medically trained provider increased from 51 percent to 64 percent. Between 2011 and 2014, ANC 
from any provider increased by 10 percentage points, from 68 percent to 78 percent, and ANC from a 
medically trained provider increased by 9 percentage points, from 55 to 64 percent. The sharp increase in 
ANC in the three years between BDHS 2011 and BDHS 2014 is mostly due to an increase in ANC from 
medically trained providers, mainly qualified doctors, whose role in ANC increased from 43 percent in 2011 
to 58 percent in 2014. This is a positive trend because there has been a concern that between 2004 and 2011 
ANC from a medically trained provider had changed very little (4 percentage points, from 51 percent to 55 
percent).

9.1.2 Place of Antenatal Care 
The place where a woman receives antenatal care influences the frequency and quality of care 
received. Information on the source of ANC also assists policymakers with decisions on how to allocate 
resources. Table 9.2 shows the percentage of women with a live birth in the three years preceding the survey 
who received ANC for the most recent birth, according to the place where they received that care. Because 
women may visit more than one type of facility for ANC during the same pregnancy, the categories are not 
mutually exclusive and do not sum to 100 percent. The private sector is the leading source for ANC (52 
percent), followed by the public sector (36 percent), and the nongovernmental organizations (NGO) sector 
(11 percent). Sixteen percent of women received ANC at home. 
The place where a woman receives antenatal care does not vary much by age. In contrast, women 
with fewer than four live births (i.e., birth order of 1 to 3), women in urban areas, women who have completed 
secondary or higher education, and women in the highest wealth quintile are more likely to receive ANC 
from the private sector. For example, 69 percent of women who completed secondary or higher education 
received ANC from the private sector compared with 38 percent of women with no education. Women in 
the lower two wealth quintiles are more likely to seek ANC from the public sector than from the private 
sector.

Comparable data from the 2011 and 2014 BDHS surveys show a decrease in the proportion of 
women who received ANC from the public sector (from 41 percent in 2011 to 36 percent in 2014) and an 
increase of 9 and 2 percentage points in the private and NGO sector, respectively (Figure 9.2).

9.1.3 Number of Antenatal Visits 
Under normal circumstances, the World 
Health Organization (WHO) recommends that a 
pregnant woman should have at least four antenatal 
care visits (WHO 2007). Table 9.3 presents information 
on the number of antenatal visits for the most recent live 
birth in the three years preceding the survey. Thirty-one 
percent of women with a live birth in the three years 
before the survey made four or more ANC visits during 
their pregnancy. Urban women were more likely than 
rural women to have made four or more antenatal visits 
(46 percent compared with 26 percent). For urban 
women this percentage has hardly changed between 
2011 and 2014 (from 45 to 46 percent), while in rural 
areas the percentage of women who made four or more 
antenatal care visits increased from 20 percent to 26 percent between surveys. 
The HPNSDP results framework sets a target of 50 percent of pregnant women making at least four 
antenatal care visits to be achieved by 2016 (MOHFW 2011). Data from the 2014 BDHS show that 
Bangladesh lags far behind in reaching this target. A comparison of the 2014 BDHS with the 2004, 2007, 
and 2011 BDHS surveys shows that the percentage of women who had no ANC visit has declined from 42 
percent in 2004 to 21 percent in 2014. At the same time, the percentage of pregnant women who made four 
or more antenatal visits has increased, from 17 percent in 2004 to the current level of 31 percent (Figure 9.3).

9.1.4 Components of Antenatal Care 
The content of antenatal care is an essential component of ANC service quality. Focused ANC 
hinges on the principle that every pregnancy is at risk of complications. Therefore, apart from receiving basic 
care, every pregnant woman should be monitored for complications. Ensuring that pregnant women receive 
information and undergo screening for complications should be a routine part of all ANC visits. To assess 
ANC services, mothers in the 2014 BDHS were asked a number of questions about the care they received. 
These included measurement of weight and blood pressure, assessment of urine and blood samples and an 
ultrasonogram. In addition, women were asked if they had been informed of signs of pregnancy 
complications. 
The proportion of pregnant women who sought antenatal care and had their weight and blood 
pressure measured was found to be high (84 and 88 percent, respectively) (Table 9.4). Overall, 65 and 55 
percent of women reported that they had urine and blood taken for testing, respectively. More than half (57 
percent) of mothers who received ANC reported that they were informed about pregnancy complications 
during the ANC visit. Remarkably, an ultrasonogram was done on 71 percent of women. 
The quality of antenatal care was closely related to mother’s education, wealth, residence, and birth 
order. Women with a birth order of one, women who had completed secondary or higher education, and 
women in the highest wealth quintile were more likely to receive most of the services. For example, 93 
percent of women with secondary or higher education had their weight measured compared with 78 percent 
of women with no education. Women in the lowest wealth quintile were less often provided information 
about pregnancy complications (48 percent) compared with women in the highest wealth quintile (64 
percent). Urban women (62 percent) were more likely to be informed of signs of pregnancy complications 
compared with rural women (55 percent). 
The overall quality of antenatal care has improved since 2007. The percentage who had their urine 
samples taken, blood samples taken, and ultrasonogram performed increased by 10, 17, and 34 percentage 
points respectively. Also, the percentage of pregnant women who were informed of complications during 
pregnancy increased by 18 percentage points. In contrast, the percentage of pregnant women whose weight 
and blood pressure were measured has remained high and almost the same. Measuring weight and blood 
pressure are the most common components of ANC.

DELIVERY CARE 
Proper medical attention and hygienic conditions during delivery can reduce the risk of 
complications and infections that can cause death or serious illness for the mother or the newborn. Hence, it 
is important to increase the proportion of births delivered in a safe, clean environment and under the 
supervision of health professionals. The Bangladesh Maternal Health Strategy, which encourages women to 
deliver under the care of medically trained birth attendants, promotes safe motherhood through various 
activities, especially delivery by a skilled birth attendant (SBA). Women interviewed in the 2014 BDHS 
reported on the place and type of assistance during delivery of all children born in the three years before the 
survey. The tables presented in this report on delivery-related services are based on all live births in the three 
years preceding the survey. 
9.2.1 Place of Delivery 
Table 9.5 presents the percent distribution of live births in the three years preceding the survey by 
place of delivery, according to background characteristics. Thirty-seven percent of births in the three years 
before the survey were delivered at a health facility. Overall, 22 percent of the births were delivered in a 
private facility, 13 percent were delivered in a public facility, and 2 percent in an NGO facility. Sixty-two 
percent of births were delivered at home. The likelihood of delivering in a health facility is lower for women 
 Maternal and Newborn Health  •  119 
age 35 or older compared with younger women. Facility delivery decreases sharply as birth order increases. 
Women’s number of antenatal care visits, education level, and wealth status have a positive relationship with 
the likelihood of delivering in a health facility. Across divisions, Khulna has the highest proportion of births 
delivered at a health facility (55 percent), while Sylhet has the lowest (23 percent).

Although still low, the proportion of births delivered at health facilities has continued to increase 
from 12 percent in 2004 to 17 percent in 2007, 29 percent in 2011, and to the current level of 37 percent in 
2014 (Figure 9.4) The increase since 2007 is mostly due to a sharp increase in delivery at private facilities 
(from 8 percent in 2007 to 15 percent in 2011 and to 22 percent in 2014), and to a less significant increase 
in deliveries in public facilities (from 8 percent in 2007 to 12 percent in 2011 and to 13 percent in 2014).

Figure 9.4  Trend in facility births, 2004-2014 
 
Bangladesh has been making progress in reducing the gap between the poorest and the richest 
women in the use of facilities for delivery. In the 2014 BDHS, 15 percent of births to women in the lowest 
wealth quintile were delivered in a health facility compared with 70 percent of births in the highest wealth 
quintile (Figure 9.5). This translates to a ratio of about 1 to 5. In the effort to achieve equity in delivery in a 
health facility, the HPNSDP sets a ratio of less than 1 to 4 between women in the lowest and the highest 
quintiles (MOHFW 2011). The corresponding ratios in the 2007 BDHS and 2011 BDHS among births in the 
three years before the survey are 1 to 8 and 1 to 6, respectively.

9.2.2 Caesarean Section 
Table 9.5 also shows the percentage of live births delivered by Caesarean section during the three 
years preceding the survey. The percentage of C-section births is sometimes considered to be a proxy 
indicator of women’s access to skilled care for complicated deliveries. In 2014, 23 percent of live births in

the three years preceding the survey were delivered by C-section, which implies that 6 in every 10 births in 
a health facility are delivered by C-section. Urban women are twice as likely as rural women to deliver by 
C-section (38 percent in urban areas and 18 percent in rural areas). Among women with secondary or higher 
education and women in the highest wealth quintile, half of births were delivered by C-section. 
The percentage of births delivered by C-section has been increasing over time, from 4 percent in 
2004, to 9 percent in 2007, to 17 percent in 2011, and to the current level of 23 percent (Figure 9.6). 
Figure 9.6  Trend in births delivered by C-section, 2004-2014 
 
Table 9.6 presents the percent distribution of women who gave birth in a health facility in the three 
years preceding the survey by duration of stay in the facility and type of delivery. Among women who gave 
birth by C-section, 97 percent stayed at the hospital for more than three days compared with 13 percent of 
women who had a vaginal birth. Among women who had a vaginal birth in a health facility, 38 percent were 
discharged less than 11 hours after delivery, and about 44 percent were discharged one to two days after 
delivery.

The 2014 BDHS collected information on the reasons for 
which a doctor proposed to have the birth delivered by C-section. 
Table 9.7 shows the findings for the most recent live births in the three 
years preceding the survey. The most common reasons cited include 
mal-presentation of the baby (42 percent) and failure to progress in 
labor (21 percent). 
9.2.3 Assistance during Delivery 
Obstetric care from a trained provider during delivery is 
critical for the reduction of maternal and neonatal mortality. Table 9.8 
shows the percent distribution of all live births in the three years 
preceding the survey by type of assistance during delivery, according 
to background characteristics. Forty-two percent of births in 
Bangladesh were attended by medically trained personnel, that is, a 
qualified doctor, nurse, midwife, family welfare visitor (FWV), or 
community skilled birth attendant (CSBA)1. Additionally, trained 
traditional birth attendants assisted in 10 percent of deliveries. 
However, more than one-third of births in Bangladesh were assisted by dais or untrained traditional birth 
attendants (37 percent), and 6 percent of deliveries were assisted by relatives and friends. 
                                                     
 
1 In Bangladesh, although medical assistants (MAs) and sub-assistant community medical officers (SACMOs) are 
considered medically trained providers for antenatal care and postnatal care, they are not considered medically trained 
providers for childbirth.

 124  •  Maternal and Newborn Health 
First-order births are more likely to be assisted by a medically trained provider (52 percent). 
Medically assisted births are more common among women in urban areas (61 percent), women who have 
completed secondary or higher education (75 percent), and women in the highest wealth quintile (74 
percent). Among divisions, Khulna has the highest proportion of births assisted by medically trained 
providers (58 percent), while Sylhet has the lowest (27 percent). 
The HPNSDP target for delivery by a medically trained provider is set at 50 percent by 2016 
(MOHFW, 2011). Over the past 10 years, the proportion of deliveries by medically trained providers has 
increased 2.6 times, from 16 percent in 2004 to the current level of 42 percent (Figure 9.7). This is almost 
solely due to an increase in institutional delivery, given that the great majority of births delivered at home 
are delivered by unskilled individuals (92 percent in 2014) (Table 9.8). 
Figure 9.7  Trend in skilled attendance at deliveries, 2004-2014 
 
9.3 
POSTNATAL CARE FOR MOTHERS AND CHILDREN 
Postnatal care is a crucial component of safe motherhood and neonatal health. Postnatal checkups 
provide an opportunity to assess and treat delivery complications and to counsel mothers on how to care for 
themselves and their newborn infant. A large proportion of maternal and neonatal deaths occur during the 
24 hours following delivery (UNICEF 2012). In addition, the first two days following delivery are critical 
for monitoring complications for both mothers and their newborns. 
To assess the extent to which mothers receive postnatal care, the 2014 BDHS asked the respondent 
whether she and her child had received a health checkup after the delivery, the timing of the first check, and 
the type of health provider for the last birth in the three years preceding the survey. 
9.3.1 Postnatal Checkup for Mother 
The 2014 BDHS data show that 39 percent of mothers and 36 percent of children in Bangladesh 
received postnatal care from a medically trained provider within 42 days after delivery, the vast majority 
within the crucial first two days of delivery (36 percent of women and 32 percent of children) (Table 9.9). 
On the other hand, 61 percent of mothers and 64 percent of children did not receive a postnatal checkup from 
a medically trained provider. 
Occurrence of a postnatal checkup from a medically trained provider within two days of delivery 
has increased from 20 percent of mothers in 2007 to 27 percent in 2011 to the current level of 36 percent

(Figure 9.8). This demonstrates that the revised target of HPNSDP 2011-2016 for postnatal checkup for 
mothers from a medically trained provider within two days of delivery (35 percent) has already been 
achieved in 2014. For children, a postnatal checkup from a medically trained provider within the first two 
days increased from 20 percent in 2007 to the current level of 32 percent.

Note: Total includes 2 children with missing information on place of delivery. Medically trained provider includes qualified doctor, nurse, midwife, 
paramedic, family welfare visitor (FWV), community skilled birth attendants (CSBA), and MA/SACMO. 
1 Includes women who received a checkup after 41 days and women who received a checkup from non-medically trained providers 
2 Primary complete is defined as completing grade 5. 
3 Secondary complete is defined as completing grade 10. 
 
 
The skill of the provider who performs the first postnatal checkup has important implications for 
maternal and neonatal health. Table 9.11 shows that among women who gave birth in the last three years, 
25 percent of women received care from a qualified doctor, and 12 percent received care from a nurse, 
midwife, paramedic, or family welfare visitor (FWV) within two days after birth. Forty-one percent of 
women who gave birth received no postnatal checkup within two days of birth. 
The likelihood of receiving postnatal care from a medically trained provider within two days of 
delivery differs substantially by mother’s age, birth order, place of delivery, residence, education, and wealth 
quintile. Women younger than age 35 at the time of birth (36-37 percent), women having their first child (45 
percent), urban women (56 percent), women who have completed a secondary education or higher (66 
percent), and women in the highest wealth quintile (69 percent) are much more likely to receive the first 
postnatal checkup from a medically-trained provider in the first two days after delivery compared with other 
women. Receiving the first postnatal checkup from a trained provider within two days of delivery is most 
common in Khulna (51 percent) and least common in Sylhet (23 percent).

The content of postnatal care is an essential 
component of service quality. Focused postnatal care 
hinges on the principle that the first few days after birth 
are very crucial for both mother and child. The 2014 
BDHS is the first DHS survey in Bangladesh to collect 
information on components of postnatal care for both 
mother and child. 
Among mothers who sought postnatal care, 43 
percent had their breasts examined, 41 percent were 
assessed for any vaginal discharge, 84 percent had their 
temperature measured, and over half (56 percent) 
received counseling on the danger signs (Table 9.12). 
These examinations are more likely to be conducted by a medically trained provider than a non-medically 
trained provider.

Table 9.13 shows that 26 percent of the newborns had a postnatal checkup within 4 hours after birth, 
and 28 percent of newborns had a postnatal checkup within 24 hours after birth from a medically trained 
provider. Differences by mother’s age, birth order, place of birth, residence, education, and wealth quintile 
are pronounced and are similar to patterns for mothers’ timing of postnatal checkups.

percentages receiving services from a medically trained 
provider compared with a non-medically trained 
provider, except in measurement of weight. Within two 
days of birth, those who received PNC from a medically

NEWBORN CARE 
Newborn primary care focuses on the use of clean instruments to cut the umbilical cord, cord care, 
bathing delays, prevention of hypothermia, and keeping the newborn warm. The 2014 BDHS is the third 
DHS survey in Bangladesh to collect information on newborn care. Women who gave birth in the past three 
years, but who did not deliver their last-born child in a health facility, were asked about newborn care 
practices, including cord cutting, drying, and bathing of the newborn following birth. 
9.4.1 Care of the Umbilical Cord 
According to the 2014 BDHS, a blade is the most common instrument used to cut the umbilical cord 
(97 percent); 19 percent of the births used a blade from the delivery kit and 78 percent used a blade from 
other sources (Table 9.16). 
The instrument used to cut the cord was boiled before use in 83 percent of non-institutional births. 
The use of a boiled instrument to cut the umbilical cord varies slightly by background characteristics. For 
example, a boiled instrument was used in 85 percent of the births to women residing in urban areas compared 
with 83 percent in rural areas. Similarly, the use of a boiled instrument ranges from a low of 81 percent of 
births to mothers in the lowest wealth quintile to a high of 85 percent in the highest quintile.

The use of a blade from a delivery kit has increased substantially between surveys, from 6 percent 
in 2007 to 14 percent in 2011 and to 19 percent in 2014, while the use of boiled instruments has increased 
only slightly, from 62 percent in 2007 to 84 percent in 2011 and then dropped 83 percent in 2014 (Figure 
9.9). 
Figure 9.9  Trend in use of appropriate cord care, 2007-2014 
 
Table 9.17 shows what material was applied to the cord immediately after cutting it, according to 
the mother’s background characteristics. In over a half of the cases (52 percent), nothing was applied to the 
cord after it was cut. When something was applied to the cord, mustard oil with garlic and antibiotics were 
the most common materials (19 and 17 percent, respectively), followed by antiseptics (9 percent), and Boric 
powder (4 percent). Other materials used were turmeric juice or powder, chewed rice, shidur (vermillion), 
gention violet, and ginger juice, but their use is not widespread, about 1 percent or less. 
The practice of applying nothing to the umbilical cord was applicable till July 2013, when the 
National Core Committee approved of the recommended practice of applying chlorhexidine to the umbilical 
cord. Although the recommendation was approved before the 2014 BDHS survey fieldwork, the practice did 
not start until July 2015. The question regarding the application of chlorhexidine was asked in the survey, 
but did not have any significant number of responses, and hence the results are not included in Table 9.17. 
The practice of applying nothing to the umbilical cord increased slightly from 56 percent in 2007 to 
59 percent in 2011, but dropped to 52 percent in 2014 (Figure 9.9).

9.4.2 Drying and Bathing the Newborn 
Newborns should be dried within minutes after birth, placed on the mother’s bare chest after birth, 
and should not be bathed in the first 24 hours in order to reduce the risk of hypothermia (WHO 2012). The 
2014 BDHS asked mothers with non-institutional deliveries in the past three years about all three 
components of thermal care of newborn: when the newborn was first dried, whether the newborn was given 
skin-to-skin care, and when the newborn was first bathed. The tables are based on births in the past three 
years. 
Table 9.18 shows that one in four (25 percent) of the newborns was put on the chest to allow for 
skin-to-skin contact. This practice is more common among births to younger mothers, low parity births, and 
births in Dhaka and Khulna. The skin-to-skin practice has no clear relationship with the mother’s education 
or wealth status. 
Table 9.18 shows that 67 percent of the newborns were dried within the recommended 5 minutes of 
birth, 83 percent of the newborns were dried within 10 minutes, and 9 percent after 10 minutes. Seven percent 
of newborns were not dried. 
 Maternal and Newborn Health  •  133 
There is little variation in early drying of newborns by background characteristics. Among divisions, 
newborns in Rajshahi and Rangpur are more likely to be dried within five minutes of birth (75 and 74 percent, 
respectively) compared with newborns in other divisions (70 percent and lower). Early drying does not vary 
significantly with mother’s education. However, early drying of newborns is more prevalent among 
newborns in the highest wealth quintile (75 percent). 
The practice of immediate drying after birth has improved considerably since 2007, when only 6 
percent of newborns were dried within five minutes, compared with 51 percent in 2011 and 67 percent in 
2014.

The 2014 BDHS assessed the timing of a newborn’s first bath. Table 9.19 shows that 34 percent of 
newborns were first bathed 72 hours or more following birth, which is the recommended practice in 
Bangladesh. Thirty-two percent of the newborns were bathed within the first 6 hours of birth, while 39 
percent were bathed in the first 24 hours. 
Bathing 72 hours or more after birth is most common among children born to women younger than 
age 20 and for birth order 2-3. Among divisions, Rangpur (51 percent) has the highest proportion of 
newborns bathed after 72 hours of delivery, while Chittagong and Khulna (28 to 31 percent) have the lowest 
proportions. Waiting to give a newborn the first bath is also associated with the mother’s education. Twenty-
three percent of newborns to women with no education are bathed at least 72 hours after birth compared with 
45 percent of newborns whose mothers have completed secondary or higher education.

9.4.3 Essential Newborn Care 
The National Neonatal Health Strategy and Guidelines 
for Bangladesh recommend a set of essential newborn care 
practices (MOHFW 2009). Essential newborn care focuses on the 
use of clean instruments to cut the umbilical cord, applying 
nothing to the cord, immediate drying (within five minutes) 
keeping the baby warm, delaying bathing to 72 hours after birth, 
and initiating breastfeeding within 1 hour of delivery. 
To assess the extent to which newborn care practices 
have been followed, Table 9.20 summarizes the essential 
newborn care practices among non-institutional last live births in 
the three years preceding the survey. Overall, only 6 percent of 
newborns receive all the essential newborn care practices. This 
proportion was 5 percent in 2011 (Figure 9.10). 
A comparison of the 2011 and 2014 BDHS findings 
shows considerable improvement in newborn bathing practices in 
Bangladesh (Figure 9.10). Using a clean delivery kit/bag or boiling the blade to cut the cord has increased 
slightly from 86 percent in 2011 to 88 percent in 2014. The recommended practice of applying nothing to

the umbilical cord of the newborn has declined from 59 to 52 percent. In contrast, use of the recommended 
practice of drying the newborns within 5 minutes of birth has increased substantially, from 51 to 67 percent. 
Adherence to recommended practices regarding initiation of breastfeeding within one hour of birth 
and delayed bathing of the newborn has increased in the last three years. The recommended practice of first 
bathing babies at least 72 hours after birth has increased from 17 percent in 2007 to 28 percent in 2011 and 
further increased to 34 percent in 2014. Initiation of breastfeeding within one hour of birth increased from 
50 percent in 2011 to 57 percent in 2014.

his chapter presents findings from several areas of importance to child health; characteristics of the 
neonate (birth weight and size at birth), vaccination status of children, and important childhood 
illnesses and their treatment. The information on birth weight and neonate’s size assists in monitoring 
programs to decrease neonatal and infant mortality by reducing the incidence of low birth weight. 
The presentation of information on vaccination coverage focuses on the age group 12-23 months. 
Overall coverage levels at the time of the survey and by age 12 months are shown for this age group. 
Additionally, the source of the vaccination information (whether based on a written vaccination card or on 
the mother’s recall) is shown. Differences in vaccination coverage between different subgroups of the 
population are an aid in program planning. 
Examining treatment practices and the contact with health services for children with the three most 
important childhood illnesses—diarrhea, acute respiratory infection (ARI), and fever—can help in the 
assessment of national programs aimed at reducing mortality from these illnesses. Information is provided 
on the prevalence and treatment of ARI and its treatment with antibiotics and the prevalence of fever and its 
treatment with antimalarial drugs and antibiotics. The treatment of diarrheal disease with oral rehydration 
therapy (including increased fluids) aids in the assessment of programs that recommend such treatment. 
Because the appropriate use of zinc can help reduce the severity and duration of diarrheal disease, 
information is also provided on this treatment. 
10.1 CHILD’S SIZE AT BIRTH 
A child’s birth weight or size at birth is an important indicator of the child’s vulnerability to the risk 
of childhood illnesses and chances of survival. Children whose birth weight is less than 2.5 kilograms, i.e., 
low birth weight (LBW), have a higher than average risk of early childhood death. Because birth weight was

Key Findings 
• Among children age 12-23 months in 2014, 78 percent are fully 
vaccinated by 12 months of age. 
• Six percent of children under age 5 had diarrhea in the two weeks 
preceding the survey. Of these children, 36 percent were taken for 
treatment to a health facility or health provider. Among children with 
diarrhea, 77 percent received ORS, 84 percent received oral rehydration 
therapy (ORT), which is ORS or recommended home fluid, and 38 
percent received both ORT and zinc. 
• The use of ORT and zinc to treat children with diarrhea increased from 
20 percent in 2007 to 38 percent in 2014; ORT use increased from 81 to 
84 percent, but ORS use remained at 77 percent. 
• Five percent of children under age 5 had symptoms of acute respiratory 
infection (ARI) in the two weeks preceding the survey. For 42 percent of 
these children, treatment was sought from a health facility or health 
provider, and 34 percent were given antibiotics to treat the illness. 
• Thirty-seven percent of children under age 5 had a fever in the two 
weeks preceding the survey. Of these children, 55 percent were taken to 
a health facility or health provider for treatment. Among those who 
received treatment, 9 percent received antibiotic drugs. Over half (55 
percent) of the drugs were prescribed by a health professional/worker.

not collected in the 2014 BDHS, the mother’s perception of the baby’s birth size was obtained. A mother’s 
report of a child being “very small” or “smaller than average,” even though subjective, is considered as a 
useful proxy for LBW. 
Table 10.1 presents the information on child’s size at birth according to their mothers’ estimate. 
Overall, 7 percent of children were considered by their mothers to be very small at birth, 13 percent smaller 
than average, and 80 percent average or larger in size. There are small differences in mother’s perception of 
their children’s size at birth by mother’s age at birth and by birth order. Across divisions of the country, 
mothers in Sylhet are more likely than mothers in other divisions to think that their children are smaller than 
average. Mothers in Rangpur, on the other hand, are more likely than mothers in other divisions to consider 
their babies as average or larger than average. In general, a mother’s perception that her child’s size at birth 
is average or larger increases with her education and wealth status. For instance, 73 percent of children whose 
mothers have no education are considered average or larger compared with 86 percent of children whose 
mothers have completed secondary or higher education.

10.2 VACCINATION OF CHILDREN 
In 1979, the government of Bangladesh initiated the Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) 
against six preventable diseases (tuberculosis; diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus; polio; and measles). Efforts 
intensified after 1985, when Bangladesh committed itself to reaching universal child immunization by 1990 
(Jamil et al. 1999). Universal immunization of children against the major vaccine-preventable diseases 
 Child Health  •  139 
(tuberculosis, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, hepatitis, haemophilus influenzae type B, poliomyelitis, 
pneumonia, measles, and rubella) is globally recognized as one of the most cost-effective programs to reduce 
infant and child morbidity and mortality. The EPI incorporated the hepatitis B (HepB) vaccine in 2003 (EPI 
2004). The hepatitis B vaccine was initially distributed in seven districts and one City Corporation, and then 
gradually expanded to all districts of Bangladesh by October 2005. Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib) 
vaccine was introduced in Bangladesh in 2009. This was done in the form of pentavalent vaccine that 
included diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus (DPT), HepB, and the new Hib vaccine. Measles and rubella 
vaccine were introduced in the EPI in 2012 (EPI 2013). 
The EPI is a priority program for the government of Bangladesh. It follows the international 
guidelines recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). According to the Bangladesh 
immunization guidelines, children are considered fully vaccinated when they have received doses of the 
“standard eight” antigens—one dose of the vaccine against tuberculosis (BCG), three doses of pentavalent 
(DPT, Hib, and HepB), three doses of polio vaccine (excluding polio vaccine given at birth), and one dose 
of measles and rubella vaccine. One dose of BCG is given at birth or at first contact with health workers; the 
pentavalent and polio vaccines require three doses at approximately 6, 10, and 14 weeks; and the measles 
and rubella vaccine is given soon after 9 months. WHO recommends giving children all of these vaccines 
before their first birthday and recording the vaccinations on a vaccination card given to the parents. 
The 2014 BDHS collected data on childhood vaccinations for all surviving children born during the 
five-year period before the survey. In Bangladesh, immunizations are routinely recorded on a vaccination 
card. For each child, mothers were asked whether they had the vaccination card and, if so, to show the card 
to the interviewer. If the mother was able to show the vaccination card, the dates of vaccinations were 
transferred from the card to the survey questionnaire. If the vaccination card was not available, mothers were 
asked to recall whether the child had received each vaccine. 
10.2.1 Vaccination Coverage 
Table 10.2 presents information on vaccination coverage according to the source of information. 
The data are for children age 12-23 months, thereby including only those children who have reached the age 
by which they should be fully vaccinated. According to information from both vaccination cards and 
mother’s reports, 84 percent of children age 12-23 months are fully vaccinated. The level of coverage for 
BCG, three doses of pentavalent vaccine, and three doses of polio vaccine is 91 percent or higher. Coverage 
for measles vaccine is slightly lower (86 percent). Coverage for the pentavalent and polio vaccines declines 
with the dosage, from 97 percent each for the first dose to 91 percent each for the third dose. Only 2 percent 
of children age 12-23 months have not received any vaccinations.

Note: Data for polio vaccination were adjusted for a likely misreporting. It appears that, for some children, mothers may have reported that the first polio dose took 
place “soon after birth”, when in fact the dose was polio 1 and not polio 0. To correct for any such errors, the total number of doses of pentavalent and polio was 
checked, because the two vaccinations are usually given at the same time. For children reported as having received the same or fewer pentavalent doses than 
polio doses, the first dose of polio was assumed to be polio 1, not polio 0. For example, children who were reported by the mother to have received all three doses 
of pentavalent and polio 0, polio 1, and polio 2 only, it was assumed that polio 0 was in fact polio 1, polio 1 was in fact polio 2, and polio 2 was in fact polio 3. 
1 BCG, measles, and three doses each of pentavalent and polio vaccine (excluding polio vaccine given at birth and polio 4) 
2 For children whose information is based on the mother’s report, the proportion of vaccinations given during the first year of life is assumed to be the same as for 
children with a written record of vaccination. 
 
 140  •  Child Health 
Vaccinations are most effective when given at the proper age. Therefore, in line with the WHO 
guidelines, it is recommended that children complete the schedule of immunizations during their first year 
of life (i.e., by age 12 months). Overall, 78 percent of children age 12-23 months had received all the 
recommended vaccinations before their first birthday. The Health, Population and Nutrition Sector 
Development Program (HPNSDP) 2011-2016 sets a target of 90 percent coverage for measles vaccine by 
age 12 months by 2016 (MOHFW 2011). The 2014 BDHS shows that 80 percent of children have received 
the measles vaccine by age 12 months. 
10.2.2 Differentials in Vaccination Coverage 
Table 10.3 shows differences in vaccination coverage by background characteristics. Vaccination 
coverage does not vary by the sex of the child. Birth order is negatively related to the likelihood of being 
fully vaccinated—as birth order increases, vaccination coverage declines. Among administrative divisions, 
the highest level of coverage is seen in Rangpur (90 percent) and the lowest in Sylhet (61 percent). As 
expected, mother’s education and wealth status are positively associated with children’s likelihood of being 
fully vaccinated. For instance, 95 percent of children whose mothers completed secondary or higher 
education are fully vaccinated compared with 74 percent of children whose mothers have no education. Table 
10.3 also shows that vaccination cards were seen for 74 percent of children age 12-23 months.

Note: Data for polio vaccination were adjusted for a likely misreporting. It appears that, for some children, mothers may have reported that the first polio dose took place “soon 
after birth,” when in fact the dose was polio 1 and not polio 0. To correct for any such errors, the total number of doses of pentavalent and polio was checked, since the two 
vaccinations are usually given at the same time. For children reported as having received the same or fewer pentavalent doses than polio doses, the first dose of polio was 
assumed to be polio 1, not polio 0. For example, children who were reported by the mother to have received all three doses of pentavalent and polio 0, polio 1, and polio 2 only, 
it was assumed that polio 0 was in fact polio 1, polio 1 was in fact polio 2, and polio 2 was in fact polio 3.

10.2.3 Trends in Vaccination Coverage 
Figure 10.1 shows that the proportion of children receiving all basic vaccinations by age 12 months 
increased between surveys in 2004 and 2011. Between 2011 and 2014, coverage of measles vaccination 
decreased by 4 percentage points and coverage of all basic vaccinations decreased by 5 percentage points 
(NIPORT et al. 2013). This decline in immunization coverage is of concern. It cannot be ruled out completely 
that the vaccination coverage rate in the 2014 BDHS may be underestimated. Whenever a vaccination card 
was available, this served as the source of information. If there was no written vaccination record, or if the 
vaccination was not recorded on the card, mothers were specifically asked whether the child had received 
BCG, measles, pentavalent, and polio vaccine, including the number of doses of polio and pentavalent 
vaccines. 
In BDHS 2014, for 26 percent of children age 12-23 months a vaccination card was not shown to 
the interviewer, and information on their vaccination was based on mother’s recall. Probing guidelines used 
by the interviewers lacked some clarity and that may have affected vaccination rates derived through recall. 
Research has shown that both of the existing sources of vaccination information (vaccination card and 
mothers’ recall) are inadequate in terms of completeness and accuracy (Islam et. al. 2009).

10.3 CHILDHOOD ILLNESS AND TREATMENT 
This section discusses three illnesses that are major contributors to childhood morbidity and 
mortality in Bangladesh: diarrhea, acute respiratory infection (ARI), and fever. Estimates of the prevalence 
of these illnesses are presented, as well as data concerning types of treatment and feeding practices during 
diarrhea. 
10.3.1 Childhood Diarrhea 
Diarrhea remains a leading cause of childhood morbidity and mortality in developing countries. 
Dehydration from diarrhea has been an important contributing cause of childhood mortality. The 
administration of oral rehydration therapy (ORT) is a simple means of countering the effects of dehydration. 
During diarrhea, the child is given a solution prepared either by mixing water with the salts in a commercially 
prepared oral rehydration packet (ORS)—also called khabar or packet saline in Bangladesh—or by making 
a homemade solution of sugar, salt, and water, also called labon gur. Oral rehydration therapy has a long

history of use in Bangladesh because it was developed 
more than four decades ago by the International 
Center for Diarrheal Disease Research, Bangladesh 
(ICDDR,B). Currently, ORS packets are available 
through health facilities and at shops and pharmacies, 
many of which are marketed by the Social Marketing 
Company and other pharmaceutical companies. 
Research has shown that zinc provides a very 
effective treatment for diarrhea among children under 
age 5. Zinc treatment reduces the severity and 
duration of diarrhea as well as the likelihood of future 
episodes of diarrhea and the need for hospitalization. 
Studies conducted at the ICDDR,B have helped to 
build an evidence base for integrating zinc treatment 
into current child health practice and policies 
(ICDDR,B 2008). 
In the 2014 BDHS, respondents were asked 
if their children under age 5 had experienced an 
episode of diarrhea in the two weeks before the 
survey. Table 10.4 shows that 6 percent of children 
under age 5 were reported to have had diarrhea, 
including 1 percent with blood in the stools. The 
prevalence of diarrhea is highest at age 6-23 months, 
a period during which solid foods are first introduced 
into the child’s diet. This pattern is believed to be 
associated with increased exposure to illness as a 
result of both weaning and the greater mobility of the 
child, as well as the immature immune system of 
children in this age group. The prevalence of diarrhea 
is slightly higher among children living in households 
with 
non-improved 
toilet 
facilities. 
Diarrhea 
prevalence is higher for children in Barisal, 
Chittagong, and Dhaka, while children in Rangpur 
have the lowest reported diarrhea prevalence 
compared with children in other divisions. The 
relationship between diarrhea prevalence and 
mother’s education and wealth is not linear, but 
prevalence is lowest among children of mothers who have completed secondary or higher education, and 
also lowest among children living in households in the fourth wealth quintile. 
10.3.2 Treatment of Childhood Diarrhea 
For children with diarrhea in the two weeks before the survey, the mother was asked what she did 
to treat the diarrhea. Because the prevalence of diarrhea varies seasonally, the survey results pertain only to 
the period from June to October, when the fieldwork took place. Table 10.5 shows that 36 percent of children 
under age 5 with diarrhea were taken to a health facility or provider for treatment. Overall, 84 percent of 
children with diarrhea were given oral rehydration therapy (ORT)—either a solution made from oral 
rehydration salt (ORS packets) (77 percent) or a homemade sugar-salt solution (20 percent)—while 9 percent 
received no treatment at all for diarrhea. Figure10.2 shows that use of ORT increased from 81 percent in 
2011 to 84 percent in 2014.

In 2014, 20 percent of children under age 5 with recent diarrhea were given recommended home 
fluids (RHF), double the percentage in 2011, at 10 percent. The use of commercially available ORS packets 
has remained virtually unchanged in recent surveys, at 77 percent in 2007, 78 percent in 2011, and 77 percent 
in 2014 (NIPORT et al. 2009). The percentage of children receiving increased fluids has decreased slightly, 
from 25 percent in 2011 to 23 percent in 2014 (NIPORT et al. 2013). 
Zinc is another diarrheal treatment, available in the market in the form of tablets and syrup. Zinc is 
not a substitute for ORT, but when taken in addition to ORT, it can reduce the severity and duration of 
diarrhea. Table 10.6 shows that, overall, 46 percent of children under age 5 with diarrhea received ORT only, 
6 percent received zinc only, and 38 percent received both ORT and zinc. Figure 10.2 shows that the use of 
ORT and zinc to treat children with diarrhea has been increasing, from 20 percent in 2007 and 34 percent in 
2011 to the level of 38 percent in the 2014 BDHS. The combined treatment of ORT and zinc varies little by 
child’s age after age 6 months. Male children are more likely than female children to receive ORT and zinc 
 144  •  Child Health 
(40 and 36 percent, respectively). Children living in urban areas are more likely to receive ORT and zinc (40 
percent) compared with children living in rural areas (37 percent). Treatment of diarrhea with ORT and zinc 
ranges from 21 percent among children in Rajshahi and Rangpur to 52 percent in Barisal.

10.3.3 Feeding Practices during Diarrhea 
Mothers are encouraged to continue feeding children normally when they have diarrhea and to 
increase the amount of fluids they offer. The 2014 BDHS asked mothers who had a child under age 5 with 
a recent episode of diarrhea how much they gave the child to drink and eat during the diarrheal episode 
compared with their usual practice. Table 10.7 shows that 23 percent of children with diarrhea received more 
fluids than usual, while 42 percent received the usual amount. About one-third of mothers (35 percent) still 
engage in the dangerous practice of curtailing fluid intake when a child has diarrhea. The percentage of 
children with diarrhea receiving more liquids than usual has declined from 25 percent in 2011 to 23 percent 
in 2014 (NIPORT et al. 2013). Table 10.7 also shows that 34 percent of children with diarrhea were given 
the same amount of food as usual, and 58 percent were given less food.

10.3.4 Acute Respiratory Infections 
Acute respiratory infection (ARI) is a leading cause of childhood illness and death. Early diagnosis 
and treatment with antibiotics can reduce the number of deaths caused by ARI, particularly deaths resulting 
from pneumonia. Respondents in the 2014 BDHS were asked if their children under age 5 had experienced 
symptoms of ARI in the two weeks before the survey. Table 10.8 shows that, overall, 5 percent of children 
under age 5 had symptoms of ARI in the two weeks preceding the survey. The prevalence of ARI decreases 
slightly with the increasing age of the child. Children living in rural areas are more likely to suffer from ARI 
than children living in urban areas. A higher proportion of children living in Rajshahi and Sylhet have 
symptoms of ARI compared with other divisions. 
Table 10.8  Prevalence and treatment of symptoms of ARI 
Among children under age 5, the percentage who had symptoms of acute respiratory infection (ARI) in the two weeks preceding the survey and among children with

 148  •  Child Health 
Forty-two percent of children with symptoms of ARI were taken to a health facility or a medically 
trained provider for treatment. This is a slightly higher percentage than that recorded in the 2011 BDHS (35 
percent) (NIPORT et al. 2013). Female children are more likely than male children to be taken to a health 
facility or trained provider when ill with ARI (47 percent versus 39 percent), a reverse of the findings in the 
2011 BDHS (29 percent of female children versus 40 percent of male children). Urban children are more 
likely than rural children to receive treatment at a health facility or from a medically trained provider (52 
percent versus 39 percent). In addition, treatment was sought from a pharmacy for 26 percent of children, 
and 25 percent were treated by a traditional doctor. 
In the 2014 BDHS, the interviewing teams were provided with a list of drug names to facilitate 
identifying whether the drug given to a child reported to have ARI symptoms is an antibiotic or not. About 
one-third of children (34 percent) were given antibiotics. This proportion is much lower than the target of 
50 percent of children age 0-59 months that was set in the HPNSDP 2011-16 (MOHFW 2011). While it may 
seem that the use of antibiotics to treat ARI has decreased, from 71 percent in 2011 to 34 percent in 2014, 
the estimates are not comparable because the methodology for obtaining the information in the two surveys 
differs. In the 2011 BDHS, respondents were asked which drugs children with ARI symptoms took. The 
responses were recorded and checked against a precoded list of antimalarial drugs, two types of antibiotics, 
and other drugs. This likely resulted in an overestimation of the use of antibiotics. In an attempt to obtain a 
more accurate estimate on the use of antibiotics to treat ARI in children, interviewers in the 2014 BDHS 
were instructed to ask the name of the drug(s) used. If the woman did not know the name of the drug, the 
respondent was asked to show the drug or the packaging of the drug. As in the 2011 BDHS, multiple 
responses were allowed to account for multiple drugs taken for the illness in the past two weeks. In the 2014 
BDHS, the list consisted of six types of antimalarial drugs, seven types of antibiotics, and other drugs. The 
interviewers were also given a detailed list of various drugs that are commonly given to children with ARI 
and are available in the market. Table 10.8 shows that children age 6-11 months, female children, children 
living in rural areas, and children living in households in the highest wealth quintile are more likely than 
other children to receive antibiotics for symptoms of ARI. 
10.4 FEVER 
Fever is a major manifestation of malaria and other acute infections in children. Malaria and fever 
contribute to high levels of malnutrition and morbidity. Table 10.9 shows the percentage of children under 
age 5 who had a fever during the two weeks preceding the survey and their treatments. Among children 
under age 5, 37 percent had a fever in the two weeks before the survey. Children age 6-23 months are more 
likely to have fever than either younger or older children. The prevalence of fever is highest among children 
in Sylhet division (43 percent) and lowest in Khulna (31 percent). 
Fifty-five percent of the children with fever were taken to a health facility or trained medical 
provider for treatment. The percentage of children with fever for whom medical care is sought from a health 
facility or medical provider has increased from 27 percent in 2011 (NIPORT et al. 2013). Table 10.9 shows 
that urban children and children in Khulna division are more likely than rural children and children in other 
divisions to receive this kind of treatment. The likelihood of being taken to a health facility or medical 
provider for treatment increases with a mother’s education and wealth. For example, 49 percent of children 
in the lowest wealth quintile were taken to a health facility or a medical provider for treatment of their fever 
compared with 60 percent of children in the highest wealth quintile. 
Table 10.9 also shows that 9 percent of children with fever received antibiotics. Children age 48-59 
months, male children, and children in Barisal division are more likely than other children to receive 
antibiotic treatment. Five percent of children received antimalarial drugs.

Among children under age 5 with fever who were treated with antibiotics, 55 percent were 
prescribed by health professionals, an increase of 22 percentage points from 33 percent in 2011. Male 
children, urban children, and children in Dhaka division are more likely than other children to receive 
prescribed medication. Children whose mothers have secondary or higher education and children living in 
households in the highest wealth quintile are most likely to receive a prescribed antibiotic drug compared 
with children whose mothers have less education and children living in households in the lowest wealth 
quintile. 
In the 2014 BDHS, mothers of children with fever in the two weeks preceding the survey were asked 
to report in chronological order where they sought advice or treatment for their child. Table 10.10 shows the 
first source of treatment. Among children with fever, 69 percent were taken first to a private medical sector, 
a level 4 percentage points higher than in the 2011 BDHS. Ten percent of children with fever received their 
first treatment from the public sector, 2 percentage points more than in the 2011 BDHS. The proportion of 
children with fever who were not treated has declined substantially, from 24 percent in 2011 to 16 percent 
in 2014 (NIPORT et al. 2013).

NUTRITION OF CHILDREN AND WOMEN 
11
 
 
utritional status is the result of complex interactions between food consumption, overall health 
status, and care practices. Adequate nutrition is a prerequisite for attaining good health, quality of 
life, and national productivity. Although problems related to poor nutrition affect the entire 
population, women and children are especially vulnerable because of their unique physiology and 
socioeconomic characteristics. The period from birth to age 2 is crucial for optimal growth, health, and 
development. Unfortunately, this period is often marked by protein-energy and micronutrient deficiencies 
that interfere with optimal physical growth and cognitive development. Malnourished children have lower 
resistance to infection and are more likely to die from common childhood ailments, such as diarrheal diseases 
N
Key Findings 
• Thirty-six percent of children under age 5 are stunted, 14 percent are 
wasted, and 33 percent are underweight. The HPNSDP 2011-16 targets 
for 2016 for stunting and underweight have been achieved. 
• Breastfeeding is almost universal in Bangladesh; 96 percent of children 
are breastfed during the first year of life and 87 percent of children are 
breastfed until age 2. Fifty-one percent of children are breastfed within 
one hour after birth, and 89 percent are breastfed within one day after 
delivery. 
• Fifty-five percent of children under age 6 months are exclusively 
breastfed. Median duration of exclusive breastfeeding is 2.8 months. 
• Twenty-seven percent of Bangladeshi children receive a prelacteal feed. 
The likelihood of receiving a prelacteal feed is higher for births assisted 
by a health professional and for births delivered at a health facility. 
• Bottle feeding is common in Bangladesh; 22 percent of infants 6-9 
months are fed with a bottle with a nipple. Bottle feeding is most common 
among children age 4-5 months (26 percent). 
• Complementary foods are not introduced in a timely fashion for all 
children. Seventy percent of breastfed children age 6-9 months receive 
complementary foods. 
• Overall, only 23 percent of children age 6-23 months are fed 
appropriately based on recommended infant and young child feeding 
(IYCF) practices. 
• Sixty two percent of children received vitamin A supplementation in the 6 
months preceding the survey. The HPNSDP 2011-16 target for 2016 is 
90 percent. 
• Thirty-one percent of ever-married women age 15-19 are undernourished 
(BMI <18.5). However, women’s nutritional status has improved 
considerably in the last 10 years. The percentage of women 
undernourished (BMI<18.5) has declined from 34 to 19 percent between 
2004 and 2014. 
• On the other hand, overweight or obesity (BMI ≥25) among ever-married 
women age 15-49 has been increasing over the past decade from 9 
percent in 2004 to 24 percent in 2014. 
• Using a lower cutoff point, with BMI ≥23 as a measure of overweight or 
obesity among ever-married women age 15-49, the proportion has 
increased from 17 percent in 2004 to 39 percent in 2014. 
 152  •  Nutrition of Children and Women 
and respiratory infections (Black et al. 2008). Malnutrition in adults results in reduced productivity, increased 
susceptibility to infections, slow recovery from illness, and for women, increased risk of adverse pregnancy 
outcomes (Victor et al. 2008). A woman of poor nutritional status—indicated by a low body mass index 
(BMI), short stature, anemia, or other micronutrient deficiencies—has a heightened risk of obstructed labor, 
having a baby with low birth weight, producing low-quality breast milk, and dying from postpartum 
hemorrhage. Morbidity, in general, is also high for both the woman and her baby. Effects of undernutrition 
are passed from one generation to the next, as undernourished girls tend to become short adults and thus are 
more likely to have small children (Victor et al. 2008). 
Poor nutritional status is one of the most important health and welfare problems in Bangladesh. 
Young children and women of reproductive age are especially vulnerable to nutritional deficits and 
micronutrient deficiencies. At the individual level, inadequate or inappropriate feeding patterns lead to 
malnutrition. Numerous socioeconomic and cultural factors influence patterns of feeding and nutritional 
status. 
Overweight and obesity is also a growing concern in Bangladesh. Overweight individuals are 
predisposed to a wide range of health problems such as diabetes and heart disease as well as poor birth 
outcomes for women. Maternal overweight and obesity at the time of pregnancy increases the risk for 
childhood obesity that continues into adolescence and early adulthood, with the potential to transmit obesity 
to the next generation (Black et al. 2013). 
The 2014 BDHS survey measured height and weight of children under age 5 and of ever-married 
women of reproductive age. The survey also collected data on feeding practices for infants and young 
children, including breastfeeding, the feeding of solid and semi-solid foods, diversity of foods, and frequency 
of feeding. Information was also collected on the feeding of micronutrients—vitamin A and iron—and 
vitamin A supplementation among children and women. 
11.1 NUTRITIONAL STATUS OF CHILDREN 
The 2014 BDHS collected data on the nutritional status of children by measuring the height and 
weight of all children under age 5 in the selected households. The nutritional status assessment helps to 
identify subgroups of the child population that face increased risk of faltered growth and provides data for 
comparison with previous surveys in trend analyses. 
11.1.1 Measurement of Nutritional Status among Young Children 
The nutritional status of children in the survey population is compared with the World Health 
Organization (WHO) Child Growth Standards, which are based on an international sample of ethnically, 
culturally, and genetically diverse healthy children living under optimum conditions that are conducive to 
achieve a child’s full genetic growth potential (WHO 2006). The WHO Child Growth Standards identify 
breastfed children as the normative model for growth and development and document how children should 
grow under optimum conditions and with optimum infant feeding and child health practices. Use of the 
WHO Child Growth Standards is based on the finding that well-nourished children in all population groups 
for which data exist follow very similar growth patterns before puberty. These standards can therefore be 
used to assess the nutritional status of children all over the world, regardless of ethnicity, social and economic 
influences, and feeding practices. 
Three standard indices of physical growth that describe the nutritional status of children are: 
• 
Height-for-age (stunting) 
• 
Weight-for-height (wasting) 
• 
Weight-for-age (underweight) 
Each of these indices provides different information about growth and body composition that can 
be used to assess nutritional status. 
 Nutrition of Children and Women  •  153 
Height-for-age measures linear growth. A child who is more than two standard deviations below the 
median (-2 SD) of the WHO reference population in terms of height-for-age is considered short for his or 
her age, or stunted. This condition reflects the cumulative effect of chronic malnutrition. If a child is below 
three standard deviations (-3 SD) from the reference median, then the child is considered severely stunted. 
Stunting reflects a failure to receive adequate nutrition over a long period of time and is worsened by 
recurrent and chronic illness. Height-for-age, therefore, reflects the long-term effects of malnutrition in a 
population and does not vary appreciably according to recent dietary intake. 
Weight-for-height describes current nutritional status. A child who is more than two standard 
deviations below (-2 SD) the reference median for weight-for-height is considered to be too thin for his or 
her height, or wasted. This condition reflects acute or recent nutritional deficit. As with stunting, wasting is 
considered severe if the child is more than three standard deviations below the reference median. Severe 
wasting is closely linked to mortality risk. 
Weight-for-age is a composite index of weight-for-height and height-for-age. Thus, it does not 
distinguish between acute malnutrition (wasting) and chronic malnutrition (stunting). A child can be 
underweight for his or her age because the child is stunted, is wasted, or both. Children whose weight-for-
age is below two standard deviations (-2 SD) from the median of the reference population are classified as 
underweight. Children whose weight-for-age is below three standard deviations (-3 SD) from the median of 
the reference population are considered severely underweight. Weight-for-age is an overall indicator of a 
population’s nutritional health. 
Z-score means are also calculated as summary statistics representing the nutritional status of 
children in a population. These mean scores describe the nutritional status of the entire population without 
the use of a cut-off. A mean Z-score of less than 0 (i.e., a negative mean value for stunting, wasting, or 
underweight) suggests that the distribution of an index has shifted downward and that most if not all children 
in the population suffer from undernutrition relative to the reference population. 
11.1.2 Data Collection 
In the survey, all children under age 6 listed in the selected households were eligible for height and 
weight measurement, although the data analysis is restricted to children under age 5. Each interviewing team 
carried two weighing scales and two height boards. Weight was measured using lightweight SECA scales 
with digital screens, designed and manufactured under the authority of the United Nations Children’s Fund 
(UNICEF). The height/length boards were specially produced by Shorr Productions for use in survey 
settings. Recumbent length was recorded for children under age 2 or shorter than 85 centimeters. Standing 
height was measured for all other children. 
11.1.3 Levels of Child Malnutrition 
Table 11.1 shows the percentage of children under age 5 classified as malnourished according to 
height-for-age, weight-for-height, and weight-for-age indices, by various background characteristics. A total 
of 8,325 children under age 5 (unweighted) in the BDHS sample households were eligible for anthropometric 
measurements. The following analysis focuses on the 7,318 children (88 percent) for whom complete and 
credible anthropometric and age data are available. 
Height-for-age (stunting) 
The data show that 36 percent of children under 5 are considered to be short for their age or stunted 
and 12 percent are severely stunted (below -3 SD). The prevalence of stunting increases with age, from 14 
percent of children under age 6 months to 46 percent of children 18-23 months, and then decreases to 38 
percent among children age 48-59 months. Severe stunting shows a similar pattern, with children age 18-23 
months having the highest proportion of severe stunting (17 percent). Stunting is slightly higher among male 
children (37 percent) than among female children (35 percent). Stunting is more prevalent among children 
who were born less than 24 months after a preceding birth (47 percent).

NCHS/CDC/WHO reference. 
Table is based on children with valid dates of birth (month and year) and valid measurement of both height and weight. 
1 Recumbent length is measured for children under age 2, or in the few cases when the age of the child is unknown and the child is less than 85 cm; standing
height is measured for all other children. 
2 Includes children who are below -3 standard deviations (SD) from the WHO Child Growth Standards population median 
3 Excludes children whose mothers were not interviewed 
4 First-born twins (triplets, etc.) are counted as first births because they do not have a previous birth interval. 
5 Includes children whose mothers are deceased and those not in the household 
6 For women who are not interviewed, information is taken from the Household Questionnaire. Excludes children whose mothers are not listed in the Household 
Questionnaire 
7 Primary complete is defined as completing grade 5.

 Nutrition of Children and Women  •  155 
The 2014 BDHS asked mothers their perception of their child’s birth size: average or larger, small, 
or very small. Perceived birth size is used as a proxy for birth weight because the majority of deliveries in 
Bangladesh occur at home and newborns are not weighed at birth. Table 11.1 shows that among children 
who are perceived by their mothers to be very small or small, 43 percent are stunted. A previous study in 
Bangladesh showed a similar result; children’s birth weight is an important determinant of their nutritional 
status (Rahman and Chowdhury 2007). 
Rural children are more likely to be stunted than urban children (38 percent compared with 31 
percent). Stunting is most prevalent in Sylhet (50 percent) and lowest in Khulna (28 percent). Children of 
mothers with no education are much more likely to be stunted (47 percent) than children whose mothers 
have completed secondary and higher education (18 percent). The differentials in stunting across wealth 
quintiles are larger, at 49 percent of children whose mothers are in the lowest wealth quintile compared with 
19 percent of children whose mothers are in the wealthiest quintile. 
Weight-for-height (wasting) 
Overall, 14 percent of children are considered wasted or too thin for their height, and 3 percent are 
severely wasted. Moderate wasting peaks at age 9-11 months (20 percent) and severe wasting at age 12-17 
months (6 percent). Wasting among male children is similar to that among female children (15 percent and 
14 percent, respectively). Wasting is not strongly correlated with the length of the preceding birth interval. 
Children who are very small at birth are almost twice as likely to be wasted as children who are of average 
size or larger at birth (26 percent and 14 percent, respectively). Children living in urban areas are less likely 
to be wasted (12 percent) than children living in rural areas (15 percent). By division, wasting among children 
ranges from 12 percent in Dhaka to 18 percent in Rangpur and Barisal. The prevalence of wasting does not 
show a linear relationship with mother’s education and wealth quintile, as indicated by the highest prevalence 
of wasting among children of women with completed primary education (17 percent) and among children of 
women from the lowest wealth quintiles (17 percent). 
Weight-for-age (underweight) 
Table 11.1 shows that 33 percent of children under age 5 are underweight (low weight-for-age), and 
8 percent are severely underweight. Under Millennium Development Goal 1, Bangladesh has set a target to 
halve the rate of underweight children between 1990 and 2015. Using the WHO standard, the MDG1 target 
is 31 percent, whereas using the NCHS reference, the target is 33 percent. Using the WHO standard, 
therefore, according to the 2014 BDHS data Bangladesh is 2 percentage points short of reaching the MDG1 
target for underweight. 
Nineteen percent of children under age 6 months are underweight. At 6-8 months, 16 percent of 
children are underweight. The rate of underweight continues to increase with age, peaking at 38 percent at 
age 48-59 months (Figure 11.1). Female children are only slightly more likely to be underweight (33 percent) 
compared with male children (32 percent). The data show a strong correlation between underweight children 
and their perceived birth size. Babies perceived by mothers as very small at birth are much more likely to be 
underweight (51 percent) than those perceived as average or larger at birth (26 percent). 
Rural children are more likely to be underweight (35 percent) than urban children (26 percent). 
Sylhet has the highest proportion of underweight children (40 percent), while among the other divisions the 
proportion ranges from 26 percent in Khulna to 40 percent in Sylhet. As with wasting and stunting, mother’s 
education is associated with underweight; the percentage of children who are underweight is lowest among 
children of mothers with a secondary and higher education (18 percent) and highest among children of 
mothers with no education (42 percent). A similar negative relationship is observed between household 
wealth and the percentage of underweight children; children in the poorest households are more likely to be 
underweight (45 percent) compared with children in the wealthiest households (17 percent).

11.1.4 Trends in Children’s Nutritional Status 
There has been some improvement in child nutritional status over the past decade (Figure 11.2). The 
level of stunting among children under age 5 has declined from 51 percent in 2004 to 36 percent in 2014. In 
the last three years it declined by 5 percentage points. Wasting increased to 17 percent in 2007 from 15 
percent in 2004 and has gradually declined since then, to 14 percent in 2014. The level of underweight has 
declined from 43 percent in 2004 to 33 percent in 2014. The HPNSDP 2011-16 targets for 2016 are 38 
percent for stunting and 33 percent for underweight. The 2014 BDHS data show that these targets have been 
achieved.

11.2 BREASTFEEDING AND COMPLEMENTARY FEEDING 
Feeding practices play a pivotal role in determining the optimal growth and development of infants. 
Poor breastfeeding and infant feeding practices have adverse consequences for the health and nutritional 
status of children. These consequences, in turn, affect their mental and physical development. Breastfeeding 
also affects mothers by physiologically suppressing the return of fertility, thereby lengthening the interval 
between pregnancies. 
UNICEF and WHO recommend that children be exclusively breastfed (that is, given no other liquid 
or solid food or plain water) for the first six months and then should be given solid or semi-solid 
complementary foods beginning in the seventh month of life. The standard indicator of exclusive 
breastfeeding is the percentage of children under age 6 months who are exclusively breastfeeding. The 
standard indicator of timely complementary feeding is the percentage of children age 6-8 months who receive 
solid, semi-solid, or soft foods. WHO recommends that breastfeeding should continue through the second 
year of life. Use of bottles with nipples is not recommended for feeding at any age (WHO 2008). 
11.2.1 Initiation of Breastfeeding 
Early initiation of breastfeeding is important for both the mother and the child. There are a number 
of reasons to encourage early breastfeeding. Mothers benefit from early suckling because it stimulates 
production of breast milk and facilitates the release of oxytocin, which helps to contract the uterus and reduce 
postpartum blood loss. The first breast milk contains colostrum, which is highly nutritious and has antibodies 
that protect the newborn from diseases. Early initiation of breastfeeding also encourages bonding between 
the mother and her newborn. 
The 2014 BDHS collected data on infant feeding for the youngest children under age 2 who were 
living with their mother, using a 24-hour recall period. Table 11.2 presents the breastfeeding status of all 
last-born children born in the two years preceding the survey, by background characteristics. The table shows 
the percentage of children according to whether they were ever breastfed, when they started breastfeeding, 
and whether they were fed anything other than breast milk before beginning breastfeeding. Breastfeeding is 
almost universal in Bangladesh; 98 percent of last-born children who were born in the two years preceding 
the survey were breastfed at some point in their life. There are no marked differences by background 
characteristics in the proportion of children ever breastfed. 
Overall, 51 percent of children are breastfed within one hour after birth, and 89 percent are breastfed 
within one day. These results are for last-born children born in the two years preceding the survey. Table 
11.2 indicates no marked differences in the timing of initial breastfeeding within one hour of birth by the sex 
of the child. Rural children are more likely to be breastfed within one hour of birth compared with urban 
children (53 percent and 45 percent, respectively). Notable variations can be seen by geographic division. 
The proportion of children breastfed within one hour of birth is highest in Rangpur (60 percent) and lowest 
in Khulna (39 percent). 
The timing of initiation of breastfeeding varies by other background characteristics. Less likely to 
begin breastfeeding within one hour of birth are children born in a health facility (38 percent), children 
attended by a health professional at delivery (40 percent), children of mothers who completed secondary or 
higher education (45 percent), and children from households in the highest wealth quintile (44 percent). 
Similar patterns were also reported in the 2011 BDHS. 
11.2.2 Prelacteal Breastfeeding 
Prelacteal feeding is the practice of giving other liquids to a child during the first three days of life. 
The practice of prelacteal feeding is discouraged because it limits the frequency of suckling by the infant 
and exposes the child to the risk of gastrointestinal infection. Twenty-seven percent of Bangladeshi children 
 158  •  Nutrition of Children and Women 
receive a prelacteal feed. The likelihood of receiving a prelacteal feed is higher for births assisted by a health 
professional and for births delivered at a health facility. 
Prelacteal feeding is more common in Rajshahi (37 percent), Dhaka (34 percent) and Khulna (33 
percent) than in other divisions. Children of mothers with limited education and less wealth are less likely 
to receive prelacteal feeds. The 2014 BDHS did not collect information on whether the child received the 
first milk (colostrum). However, the 2007 BDHS reported that 92 percent of last-born children in the five 
years preceding the survey who were ever breastfed received colostrum (NIPORT et al. 2009).

11.3 BREASTFEEDING STATUS BY AGE 
Breast milk contains all the nutrients needed by children in the first six months of life. 
Supplementing breast milk before age 6 months is discouraged because it increases the likelihood of 
contamination, and hence risk of diarrhea. It is recommended that complementary feeding (giving solid or 
semi-solid foods to infants in addition to breast milk) start at the beginning of the seventh month of life, 
because at this age breast milk is no longer sufficient to maintain the child’s growth (WHO 2008). Children 
should be fed small quantities of solid and semi-solid foods while continuing to breastfeed. The amount of 
food is increased gradually from 6 to 23 months, which is the period of transition to eating the regular family 
diet. 
The 2014 BDHS collected data on infant feeding for the youngest children under age 2 who were 
living with their mother, using a 24-hour recall period. Table 11.3 and Figure 11.3 show that almost all 
Bangladeshi babies are breastfed for the first year of life. Children are breastfed for an extended time; at age 
20-23 months, 87 percent of children are still being breastfed. Complementary foods are introduced at an 
early age. Among infants under age 2 months, 80 percent are exclusively breastfed, while other infants are 
given water (7 percent), other milk (9 percent), and complementary foods (2 percent) in addition to breast 
milk.

Note: Breastfeeding status refers to a “24-hour” period (yesterday and last night). Children who are classified as breastfeeding and consuming plain water only 
consumed no liquid or solid supplements. The categories of not breastfeeding, exclusively breastfed, breastfeeding and consuming plain water, non-milk liquids, 
other milk, and complementary foods (solids and semi-solids) are hierarchical and mutually exclusive, and their percentages add to 100 percent. Thus children who 
receive breast milk and non-milk liquids and who do not receive other milk and who do not receive complementary foods are classified in the non-milk liquid category 
even though they may also get plain water. Any children who get complementary food are classified in that category as long as they are breastfeeding as well. 
1 Non-milk liquids include juice, juice drinks, clear broth or other liquids 
 
 
Table 11.3 presents the percentage of children using a bottle with a nipple. Bottle feeding is common 
in Bangladesh; 22 percent of infants age 6-9 months are fed with a bottle with a nipple. Bottle feeding is 
most common among children age 4-5 months (26 percent). At age 6-8 months, 20 percent of children are 
bottle fed, and 12 percent of children age 20-23 months use bottles with nipple. 
 160  •  Nutrition of Children and Women 
Figure 11.3  Infant feeding practices by age 
 
Fifty-five percent of infants under age 6 months are exclusively breastfed. This proportion is lower 
than that reported in the 2011 BDHS (64 percent) (Figure 11.4). Between the 2007 BDHS and the 2011 
BDHS there was a sharp increase in exclusive breastfeeding, from 43 percent to 64 percent. Intensive mass 
media campaigns for several years preceding the 2011 survey could have impacted the status of mothers 
reporting on breastfeeding in 2011. The 2011 BDHS report and results dissemination discussed the increased 
level of breastfeeding. It was not clear whether the increase was the result of reporting bias or actual change, 
and if the latter, whether this higher level would be sustained. The 2013 Utilization of Essential Service 
Delivery Survey and the 2012-13 Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey reported lower exclusive breastfeeding 
rates of 60 percent (Sultana et al. 2014) and 56 percent (BBS and UNICEF 2014), respectively. 
In spite of the decline in exclusive breastfeeding between 2011 and 2014, the prevalence of 
exclusive breastfeeding of infants up to age 6 months in 2014 is 5 percentage points higher than the HPNSDP 
target of 50 percent exclusive breastfeeding by 2016 (MOHFW 2011).

Figure 11.5 shows the 2011 BDHS results for key infant and young child feeding (IYCF) practices 
on breastfeeding for youngest children under age 2 who are living with their mother. Although 55 percent 
of all children under age 6 months are exclusively breastfed, only 32 percent of those age 4-5 months are 
exclusively breastfed. Almost all children (96 percent) continue breastfeeding at age 1, and 87 percent 
continue to breastfeed until age 2. Sixty-five percent of children are introduced to complementary foods at 
an appropriate age. Seventy-seven percent of children age 0-23 months are breastfed appropriately for their 
age, i.e., exclusive breastfeeding for children age 0-5 months and continued breastfeeding along with 
complementary foods for children age 6-23 months. Predominant breastfeeding (receiving breast milk and 
only plain water or non-milk liquids such as juice, clear broth, and other liquids) is prevalent in 70 percent 
of the children. Seventeen 17 percent of children under age 2 are bottle-fed.

11.4 DURATION OF BREASTFEEDING 
Table 11.4 shows the median duration and 
frequency of breastfeeding by selected background 
characteristics. The estimates of median and mean 
duration of breastfeeding are based on current status 
data, that is, the proportion of children born in the 
three years preceding the survey who were being 
breastfed at the time of the survey. 
The median duration of any breastfeeding 
among Bangladeshi children in 2014 is 31 months. 
The median duration of exclusive breastfeeding is 2.8 
months, while the median duration of predominant 
breastfeeding is 4.4 months. The mean duration of 
any breastfeeding is 28.6 months, while the mean 
duration of exclusive breastfeeding is 4 months and 
of predominant breastfeeding 5.6 months. The 
median duration of exclusive breastfeeding and 
predominant breastfeeding has decreased since 2011. 
The median duration of exclusive breastfeeding 
decreased from 3.5 months to 2.8 months, and the 
median duration of predominant breastfeeding 
decreased from 4.9 months to 4.4 months. 
The median durations of any, exclusive, and 
predominant breastfeeding do not vary much across 
background characteristics. The median duration of 
any breastfeeding is one month shorter in urban areas 
than in rural areas (30 months versus 31 months). 
Duration of exclusive breastfeeding increases slightly 
with mother’s education. In contrast, the median 
duration of exclusive breastfeeding generally 
decreases 
as 
household 
wealth 
increases. 
Differentials 
in 
exclusive 
breastfeeding 
and 
predominant breastfeeding across subgroups of 
children are smaller than for any breastfeeding. 
11.5 TYPES OF COMPLEMENTARY FOODS 
In the 2014 BDHS, women who had at least one child living with them who was born in 2012 or 
later were asked questions about the types of liquids and foods the child had consumed during the day or 
night preceding the interview. Mothers who had more than one child born in 2012 or later were asked 
questions about the youngest child living with them. Specifically, mothers were asked about the number of 
times the child had eaten solid or semi-solid food during the period. 
The results are subject to a number of limitations. The dietary data on children are subject to recall 
errors on the mother’s part. In addition, a mother may not be able to report fully on a child’s intake of food 
and liquids if the child was fed by other individuals during the period. The information in Table 11.5 is 
restricted to the youngest children under age 2 living with the mother at the time of the survey. Information 
on type of foods and liquids consumed by young children is useful in assessing timely and appropriate 
complementary feeding.

For many breastfeeding children, liquids other than breast milk are introduced earlier than the 
recommended age of 6 months. Six percent of breastfeeding children under age 2 months are given infant 
formula and 3 percent receive other milk in addition to breast milk. Two percent of breastfeeding children 
under age 2 months are given solid or semi-solid food.

Note: Breastfeeding status and food consumed refer to a “24-hour” period (yesterday and last night). 
1 Other milk includes fresh, tinned and powdered cow or other animal milk. 
2 Doesn’t include plain water. Includes juice, juice drinks, clear broth, or other non-milk liquids 
3 Includes fortified baby food 
4 Includes pumpkin, red or yellow sweet potatoes, squash, carrots, dark green leafy vegetables like spinach, poi sag, methi, kolmi, kochu, palak, ripe mangoes, papayas, 
ripe kathal, bangi or other Vitamin A rich fruits and other locally grown fruits and vegetables that are rich in vitamin A 
 
 
By age 9 months, every child is expected to be receiving at least one daily feeding of solid or semi-
solid foods. Table 11.5, however, indicates that 12 percent of breastfeeding children age 9-11 months did 
not receive any solid or semi-solid food on the day before the interview. 
Overall, 74 percent of breastfeeding children age 6-23 months consume foods made from grains 
(including fortified baby foods), 40 percent consume vitamin A-rich fruits and vegetables, 43 percent have 
meat, fish, or poultry, and 28 percent consume eggs. In addition to being breastfed, 6 percent of these children 
receive infant formula, 29 percent receive other milk, and 6 percent receive cheese, yogurt, or other milk 
products. 
As expected, non-breastfed children age 6-23 months are more likely than breastfed children to 
receive the different types of liquids and solid and semi-solid foods. The difference in the consumption of 
solid and semi-solid food between breastfed and non-breastfed children is especially marked in the 
consumption of fortified baby foods, meat, fish or poultry, and cheese, yogurt, or other milk products. 
However, caution should be exercised when interpreting these results because the number of non-breastfed 
children is small compared with the number of breastfed children. 
Figure 11.6 presents trends in the consumption of solid and semi-solid or soft foods by children age 
6-9 months since 1993-94. The trends in complementary feeding indicate an increase in the timely 
introduction of solid or semi-solid foods, with a slight decrease since 2007.

11.6 INFANT AND YOUNG CHILD FEEDING PRACTICES 
Infant and young child feeding (IYCF) practices include initiating timely feeding of solid or semi-
solid foods at age 6 months and increasing the amount and variety of foods and frequency of feeding as the 
child gets older, while maintaining frequent breastfeeding. Guidelines have been established for IYCF 
practices for children age 0-23 months (PAHO/WHO 2003; WHO 2005; WHO 2008). Although 
breastfeeding is recommended for infants up to age 2, some infants have stopped breastfeeding before 
reaching age 2 because their mothers are HIV-positive, have died, or for some other reason do not breastfeed 
(WHO 2005). 
Minimum dietary diversity means feeding the child food from at least four food groups. This cut-
off was selected because it is associated with better-quality diets for both breastfed and non-breastfed 
children. Studies have shown that plant-based complementary foods by themselves are insufficient to meet 
the needs for certain micronutrients (WHO and UNICEF1998). Therefore it is recommended that meat, 
poultry, fish, or eggs be eaten daily or as often as possible. Vegetarian diets may not meet children’s nutrient 
requirements unless supplements or fortified products are used. Vitamin A-rich fruits and vegetables should 
be consumed daily. 
Children’s diets should include an adequate fat content, because fat provides essential fatty acids, 
facilitates absorption of fat-soluble vitamins (such as vitamin A), and enhances dietary energy density and 
palatability. Consumption of food from at least four food groups means that the child has a high likelihood 
of consuming at least one animal source of food and at least one fruit or vegetable in addition to a staple 
food (grains, roots, or tubers) (WHO 2008). The four food groups should come from a list of seven food 
groups: grains, roots, and tubers; legumes and nuts; dairy products (milk, yogurt, cheese); flesh foods (meat, 
fish, poultry, and liver/organ meat); eggs; vitamin A-rich fruits and vegetables; and other fruits and 
vegetables. 
The minimum dietary diversity may be reported separately for breastfed and non-breastfed children. 
However, diversity scores for breastfed and non-breastfed children should not be directly compared, because 
breast milk is not counted in any of the above stated food groups. The recommended number of feedings is 
as follows:

• 
Breastfed infants age 6-8 months should be fed meals of complementary foods two to three 
times per day, with one or two snacks as desired; breastfed children 9-23 months should be fed 
meals three to four times per day, with one or two snacks. 
• 
Non-breastfed children age 6-23 months should receive milk products at least twice a day to 
ensure their calcium needs are met. In addition, they need animal-source foods and vitamin A-
rich fruits and vegetables. Therefore, four food groups are considered a minimum acceptable 
number of food groups for non-breastfed young children. Non-breastfed children should be fed 
meals four to five times per day, with one or two snacks as desired (WHO 2005).  
• 
Meal frequency is considered a proxy for energy intake from foods other than breast milk; 
therefore, the feeding frequency indicator for non-breastfed children includes both milk feeds 
and solid/semi-solid feeds (WHO 2008). The minimum feeding frequencies are based on the 
energy needs from complementary foods estimated from age-specific total daily energy 
requirements.  
• 
Infants with low intake of breast milk would need to be fed more frequently. However, overly 
frequent feeding may lead to the displacement of breast milk (PAHO and WHO 2003). 
Table 11.6 shows infant and young child feeding (IYCF) practices for the youngest children age 6-
23 months living with their mother. The percentage of children who are fed with appropriate feeding 
practices is calculated by taking into account current guidelines on the number of food groups and the number 
of times a child should eat during the day or night preceding the survey. 
Overall, 23 percent of children age 6-23 months are fed appropriately according to recommended 
IYCF practices; that is, they are given milk or milk products and foods from the recommended number of 
food groups and are fed at least the recommended minimum number of times. Infant and child feeding 
practices have changed very little between 2011 and 2014 BDHS (an increase of 2 percentage points), and 
are far below the revised HNPSDP target of 45 percent for 2016 (MOHFW 2014). 
The results in Table 11.6 show that 26 percent of breastfed children age 6-23 months are fed foods 
from four or more food groups, and 63 percent are fed the minimum number of times. Nearly all breastfed 
and non-breastfed children age 6-23 months are given breast milk or other milk products (97 percent). 
Overall, 28 percent of children receive the appropriately diverse diet, and 64 percent of children are fed the 
recommended number of times with solid or semi-solid foods. Because 98 percent of children age 6-23 
months are ever breastfed, the number of non-breastfed children is too small to come to any meaningful 
conclusions. 
Feeding according to IYCF recommendations is uncommon among children age 6-8 months (7 
percent), increasing to 34 percent among children age 18-23 months. Male children and female children are 
equally likely to be fed according to appropriate IYCF practices. Adherence to IYCF practices is better in 
urban areas than in rural areas (29 percent compared with 21 percent). The recommended IYCF practices 
are least common in Sylhet (17 percent) and most common in Khulna (31 percent). IYCF practices improve 
as mother’s education levels and wealth status increase. Overall the level of IYCF practice is low among all 
subgroups. Even in the highest wealth quintile, only 1 in 3 children receive appropriate feeding. These 
findings indicate, among other things, a lack of knowledge on appropriate feeding practices for infant and 
young children.

11.7 MICRONUTRIENT INTAKE AMONG CHILDREN 
Micronutrient deficiency is a major contributor to childhood morbidity and mortality. Children can 
receive micronutrients from foods, fortified food, and direct supplementation. The 2014 BDHS collected 
information on consumption of foods rich in vitamin A and iron, vitamin A and iron supplementation, and 
deworming status for children age 6-59 months. 
Table 11.7 presents data regarding the intake of key micronutrients among children age 6-59 
months. The table shows, by background characteristics, the percentage of youngest children age 6-23 
months who are living with their mother and who consumed foods rich in vitamin A and iron in the day or 
night preceding the survey. In addition, the table shows the proportion of all children age 6-59 months who 
were given vitamin A supplements or deworming medication in the six months preceding the survey and the 
proportion who were given iron supplements in the week before the survey. 
11.7.1 Consumption of Micronutrient-rich Foods 
Table 11.7 shows that 67 percent of youngest children age 6-23 months who were living with their 
mother consumed foods rich in vitamin A in the day or night preceding the survey. The proportion of children 
consuming vitamin A-rich foods increases with age, from 31 percent among children age 6-8 months to 85 
percent among children age 18-23 months. Consumption of vitamin A-rich foods is similar among male and 
female children. A higher proportion of non-breastfed children consume vitamin A rich foods than breastfed 
children (83 percent compared with 66 percent). Urban children are more likely to consume vitamin A-rich 
foods (68 percent) compared with children in rural areas (66 percent). The proportion of children consuming 
vitamin A-rich foods is highest in Khulna division (79 percent) and lowest in Sylhet and Chittagong divisions 
(63 percent). Mother’s educational status and household wealth correlate positively with the consumption of 
vitamin A-rich foods. Seventy-six percent of children of mothers with secondary or higher education 
consumed vitamin A-rich foods compared with 59 percent of children whose mothers are not educated. 
Similarly, 70 percent of children in the highest wealth quintile consumed vitamin A-rich foods compared 
with 63 percent of children in the lowest wealth quintile. 
Overall, 55 percent of children age 6-23 months consumed foods rich in iron (Table 11.7). 
Differences in the intake of iron-rich foods by background characteristics are largely similar to the 
differences in consumption of vitamin A-rich foods. Breastfed children consume less food rich in iron (54 
percent) compared with non-breastfed children (71 percent). Intake of iron-rich foods among children has 
slightly increased, from 54 percent in 2011 to 55 percent in the 2014 BDHS.

11.7.2 Micronutrient Supplementation 
Vitamin A is an essential micronutrient for the immune system. Severe vitamin A deficiency (VAD) 
can result in childhood blindness. VAD can also increase the severity of infections such as measles and 
diarrheal diseases in children and can slow recovery from illness. An important strategy in overcoming 
vitamin A deficiency in Bangladesh has been the distribution of vitamin A capsules to children age 6-59 
months. Children under age 6 months are not covered, primarily because most children in this age group are 
expected to be exclusively breastfed and should receive adequate vitamin A through breast milk. Children 
age 6-59 months receive supplementation once in every six months during the National Immunization Days 
and vitamin A campaigns. Since February 2011, children age 9-11 months are no longer provided vitamin 
A supplementation at the time they receive the measles vaccination. 
In the 2014 BDHS, mothers were asked if their children under age 5 had taken a vitamin A capsule 
in the six months preceding the survey. Table 11.7 shows that 62 percent of children age 6-59 months had 
received vitamin A supplementation in the six months before the survey. The level of vitamin A 
supplementation varies across subgroups of children. Children age 24-35 months are most likely to have 
received vitamin A supplements (65 percent). Across divisions, the proportion of children who received 
vitamin A supplements ranges from 56 percent in Sylhet to 66 percent in Rangpur. The likelihood of children 
receiving vitamin A increases with mother’s education level and wealth status. 
The coverage of vitamin A supplementation among children age 6-59 months has increased from 
60 percent in 2011 to 62 percent in 2014, which seems insufficient to attain HPNSDP target of 90 percent 
by 2016. 
In the 2014 BDHS, mothers were asked if their children under age 5 had taken an iron tablet in the 
seven days preceding the survey. Table 11.7 shows that only 4 percent of children age 6-59 months received 
iron supplements in this period. Iron supplementation varies little by children’s background characteristics. 
11.7.3 Deworming 
Certain types of intestinal parasites can cause anemia. Periodic deworming for organisms such as 
helminthes can improve children’s micronutrient status. The 2014 BDHS asked mothers if their children 
under age 5 had taken deworming medication in the six months preceding the survey. Overall, 40 percent of 
children age 6-59 months received deworming medication in this period (Table 11.7). Recently, the Ministry 
of Health and Family Welfare decided not to distribute deworming tablets during the National Vitamin A 
Plus campaign, which might explain why deworming has become less common since the 2011 BDHS, which 
found a level of 50 percent. However, decisions have been made to run vitamin A supplementation and 
deworming programs separately. 
The percentage of children who received deworming medication increases with age, from 2 percent 
of children age 6-8 months to 54 percent of children age 36-47 months. Breastfed children are less likely 
than non-breastfed children to receive deworming medication (25 percent versus 52 percent). Children in 
urban areas are more likely to receive deworming medication compared with rural children (45 percent 
versus 38 percent). Coverage also varies across divisions, from 32 percent in Rajshahi to 47 percent in 
Chittagong. Mother’s levels of education and household wealth have positive associations with children’s 
likelihood of receiving deworming medication. 
11.8 NUTRITIONAL STATUS OF WOMEN 
Malnutrition in women, encompassing both undernutrition and overweight, is a major problem with 
important consequences for survival and healthy development. Body mass index (BMI) is used to measure 
thinness or obesity. It is defined as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared (kg/m2). A BMI 
of less than 18.5 is used to define thinness or acute under nutrition. A BMI of 25 or above usually indicates 
overweight, and a BMI of 30 or above indicates obesity. 
 170  •  Nutrition of Children and Women 
In many countries chronic energy deficiency, characterized by a BMI of less than 18.5 among 
women, remains the predominant problem, leading to low work productivity and less resistance to illness. 
Low pre-pregnancy BMI and short stature of women are known risk factors for poor maternal and birth 
outcomes. Overweight and obese women are also predisposed to a wide range of health problems. Maternal 
obesity can lead to several adverse maternal and fetal complications during pregnancy, delivery, and 
postpartum (Van Lieshout et al. 2011). It increases the risk for childhood obesity that continues into 
adolescence and adulthood, potentiating transgenerational transmission of obesity (Black et al. 2013). 
The 2014 BDHS measured the height and weight of ever-married women age 15-49. The data are 
used to derive two measures of nutritional status: height and body mass index (BMI). Given the relationship 
between maternal stature and pelvic size, women’s height can be useful in predicting the risk of difficulties 
in delivery. The risk of giving birth to low-weight babies is also higher among women of small stature. The 
cut-off point at which mothers are considered at risk because of short stature normally falls between 140 and 
150 centimeters. 
Table 11.8 presents nutritional indicators for women by various background characteristics. The 
analysis excludes women for whom there was no information on height and/or weight and women for whom 
a BMI could not be estimated because they were pregnant or had given birth in the preceding two months. 
The height analysis is based on 17,710 ever-married women age 15-49, while the analysis of BMI is based 
on 16,478 women.

 Nutrition of Children and Women  •  171 
Overall, 13 percent of ever-married women are below the cut-off of 145 centimeters in height. The 
proportion below the cut-off for women’s height does not vary much by age group. Urban women and 
women in Khulna division tend to be taller than other women. Woman’s educational status and household 
wealth are positively associated with height. For example, 18 percent of uneducated women and 16 percent 
of women in the lowest wealth quintile are below 145 centimeters in height compared with 7 percent of 
women who have completed secondary or higher education and 9 percent of women in the highest wealth 
quintile. 
The mean BMI for ever-married women age 15-49 is 22.3 (Table 11.8), which falls in the normal 
BMI classification. About 6 in 10 ever-married women (58 percent) have a normal BMI, and 19 percent are 
undernourished or thin (BMI less than 18.5). Despite much discussion, the global nutrition community has 
retained the international classification of BMI ≥25 kg/m2 cut-off for overweight and obesity for adults. 
Based on this classification, 24 percent of women are overweight or obese (BMI 25 or higher). Variations 
are apparent by background characteristics. Ever-married women age 15-19 are more likely to be thin or 
undernourished compared with women in other age cohorts (Figure 11.8). The proportion of overweight 
women increases with age. Rural women are more likely than urban women to be undernourished (21 percent 
and 12 percent, respectively), whereas urban women are twice as likely to be overweight or obese compared 
with rural women (36 percent and 19 percent, respectively). Among the divisions, the proportion of 
undernourished women ranges from 14 percent in Khulna to 30 percent in Sylhet. As educational attainment 
and household wealth increase, the proportion of women who are undernourished declines sharply, while 
the proportion of overweight or obese women increases. Bangladeshi women in the highest wealth quintile 
are six times more likely to be overweight or obese compared with women in the lowest wealth quintile. 
However, the World Health Organization (WHO Expert Consultation 2004) also noted that the cut-
off points of 23, 27.5, 32.5 and 37.5 kg/m2 are to be added as points for public health action. Based on this, 
Table 11.8 includes a column showing BMI ≥23 kg/m2 as a measure of overweight and obesity by 
background characteristics. Based on this classification, 39 percent of women are overweight or obese, 15 
percentage points higher than the measure based on BMI ≥25 kg/m2. Variations across subgroups of 
population are similar to that measured by BMI ≥25 kg/m2. Using this classification, women in urban areas 
are 19 percentage points more likely than rural women to be overweight or obese (53 percent and 34 percent, 
respectively).

Comparison of anthropometric measurements of ever-married women age 15-49 collected in the 
2004, 2007, 2011, and 2014 BDHS indicate a slight improvement in the proportion of women whose height 
is less than 145 cm, from 16 percent in 2004 to 13 percent in 2014. At the same time, the mean BMI has 
increased from 20.2 in 2004 to 22.3 in 2014. Consequently, the proportion of women with a BMI below 18.5 
has decreased, from 34 percent in 2004 to 19 percent in 2014 (Figure 11.9). 
Figure 11.9  Trends in nutritional status of ever-married women, 2004-2014 
 
Figure 11.10 shows that the proportion of underweight among ever-married women 15-49 (BMI 
<18.5) has decreased markedly from 52 percent in 1996 to 19 percent in 2014. At the same time, the 
proportion of overweight women (BMI ≥25) has increased from 3 percent to 24 percent. If BMI ≥23 is 
considered, the increase in the proportion of overweight women is from 7 percent in 1996 to 39 percent in 
2014.

11.9 MICRONUTRIENT INTAKE AMONG MOTHERS 
Adequate micronutrient intake by women has 
important benefits for both the women and their children. 
Breastfeeding children benefit from the micronutrient 
supplementation that mothers receive, especially vitamin A. In 
Bangladesh, micronutrient deficiency among women is a 
common public health problem. 
Maternal vitamin A deficiency can cause visual 
impairment and possibly other health consequences. Maternal 
night blindness due to vitamin A deficiency (VAD) has been 
associated with increased low birth weight (Tielsch et al. 2008) 
and infant mortality (Christian et al. 2001). VAD can be 
prevented through provision of a high dose (200,000 IU) 
vitamin A capsule in the first six to eight weeks after delivery 
(when women are considered not at risk of being pregnant). 
Due to possible adverse effects (birth defects) resulting from 
high doses of vitamin A, pregnant women should not be given 
a high dose vitamin A supplement. The 2014 BDHS collected 
data on use of vitamin A supplements among women age 15-
49 with a child born in the past three years. 
Table 11.9 presents information on the percentage of 
women who received a dose of vitamin A during the first two 
months after the birth of their most recent child. Overall, 46 
percent of women age 15-49 with a child born in the past three 
years received a postpartum vitamin A dose. This proportion 
varies by urban-rural residence, division, educational 
attainment, and household wealth. There is no discernible 
pattern with respect to women’s age. Women in urban areas are 
more likely to receive vitamin A supplements compared with 
women in rural areas (53 percent versus 43 percent). Among divisions, the percentage of women who 
received a postpartum vitamin A dose is highest in Rangpur (50 percent) and lowest in Sylhet (30 percent). 
Postpartum vitamin A supplementation does not show a linear relationship with mother’s education 
or wealth. Postpartum vitamin A supplementation is highest among women who have completed secondary 
or higher education (55 percent) and lowest among women who have completed primary education (37 
percent). It is lowest among mothers in the second wealth quintile (40 percent) and highest among mothers 
in the highest quintile (57 percent). Figure 11.11 shows that postpartum vitamin A supplementation has 
increased remarkably in the past decade, from 15 percent in 2004, 21 percent in 2007, and 29 percent in 2011 
to its current level of 46 percent.

cquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) is an illness caused by the human immunodeficiency 
virus (HIV). AIDS was first recognized internationally in 1981. Epidemiological studies have since 
identified the main routes of transmission of HIV to be unsafe sexual intercourse, intravenous 
injections with contaminated needles, unscreened or contaminated blood transfusions, and transmission from 
an infected mother to her child during pregnancy, delivery, or breastfeeding. HIV cannot be transmitted 
through food, water, insect vectors, or casual contact. HIV infection weakens the immune system and makes 
the body susceptible to and unable to recover from other opportunistic diseases. Secondary infections, if not 
adequately treated, can lead to death. 
In Bangladesh, the first case of HIV was detected in 1989. In 2014, a total of 433 new cases of HIV 
infection, 251 new AIDS cases, and 91 deaths due to AIDS were reported. The reported number of HIV-
positive people in Bangladesh increased from 1,207 in 2007 to 3,674 in 2014, a more than three-fold increase 
in seven years (Bdnews24.com 2014). The estimated number of HIV/AIDS cases remains at 8,900, however, 
indicating both the likelihood of incomplete reporting and the potential for growth of the AIDS epidemic in 
Bangladesh (UNAIDS 2014). Although, Bangladesh is still considered a low-prevalence country for 
HIV/AIDS, it remains vulnerable to an HIV epidemic because of the high prevalence in neighboring 
countries and the high mobility of people within and beyond the country (DGHS 2015). 
The HIV/AIDS prevention program in Bangladesh started in 1985. In response to HIV/AIDS 
prevention efforts, the government of Bangladesh formed the National AIDS Committee (NAC) under the 
patronage of the president of Bangladesh. In 2010 the membership of NAC was expanded to include other 
stakeholders. The MOHFW plays the leading role in the prevention of HIV and control of the AIDS 
epidemic. In 1995, the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS) of the Ministry of Health and Family 
Welfare (MOHFW) formed a task force. The task force was convened by the Technical Committee of the 
National AIDS Council (TC-NAC). The TC-NAC was composed of national experts from various

Key Findings 
• Seventy percent of ever-married women age 15-49 have heard of 
HIV/AIDS, similar to that documented in the 2011 BDHS. 
• Between 2011 and 2014 the proportion of ever-married women who 
know two HIV prevention methods decreased from 37 to 34 percent. 
• Only 11 percent of ever-married women age 15-49 have comprehensive 
knowledge about AIDS. 
• More than half of ever-married women (56 percent) know that HIV can be 
transmitted during pregnancy and through breastfeeding, while less than 
half (44 percent) know that HIV can be transmitted during delivery. 
• Fifty-nine percent of ever-married women know that HIV can be 
transmitted both by using an unsterilized needle or syringe and by blood 
transfusion. 
• The great majority of ever-married women (91 percent) think that if a 
woman knows her husband has a sexually transmitted infection (STI), 
she is justified in refusing to have sexual intercourse with him. 
• Fourteen percent of ever-married women report having had an STI 
and/or symptoms of an STI in the 12 months preceding the survey. The 
proportion of women who sought advice or treatment for an STI from a 
clinic, hospital, or health professional increased from 31 percent in 2011 
to 46 percent in 2014. 
 176  •  HIV/AIDS-related Knowledge, Attitudes, and Behavior 
disciplines relevant to the prevention and control of HIV and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). With 
political support from the National AIDS Committee and technical support from the TC-NAC, the task force 
led the process of developing a national policy on HIV and AIDS, which was endorsed by the Cabinet in 
1997 (NASP and MOHFW 2008). In 1997, the protocol for safe blood transfusion was formulated. Today 
there are 211 blood screening centers established for screening HIV, syphilis, malaria, hepatitis B virus 
(HBV), and hepatitis C virus (HCV). With support from the government of Bangladesh, non-governmental 
organizations (NGOs) have set up an STD/AIDS network with more than 250 members working in the field 
of HIV/AIDS. As the nodal body for HIV/AIDS activities, the National AIDS/STD Program (NASP) was 
formed under the DGHS, and has functioned since 1998. The major role of the NASP is to formulate policies, 
coordinate information, and regulate the implementation of the HIV/AIDS prevention efforts in the country. 
The NASP is implementing HIV/AIDS prevention activities through a coalition of three functionaries, the 
NAC, MOHFW, and DGHS. The NASP is also responsible for coordinating activities of all stakeholders 
and development partners involved in HIV and AIDS program. Bangladesh has adopted its third National 
Strategic Plan (2011-2015), with the following objectives: to implement services to prevent new HIV 
infections; to provide universal access to treatment, care, and support services for people infected and 
affected by HIV; to strengthen coordination mechanisms and management capacity at different levels to 
ensure an effective multi-sector HIV/AIDS response; and to strengthen the strategic information systems 
and research for an evidence-based response (MOHFW 2012). Most HIV-related activities are based on 
prevention among most-at-risk populations, because Bangladesh is a country with low prevalence of HIV. 
HIV intervention programs targeting the vulnerable population in Bangladesh evolved over a period 
of more than 10 years, from 1997-2008. Initially, programs were started and led by NGOs, and a strong 
partnership developed with the government, civil society, and donors, who worked to facilitate 
comprehensive interventions for the most vulnerable groups. These groups included female sex workers and 
their male clients, injecting drug users (IDUs), men who have sex with men, transgendered persons (hijras), 
and transport workers. In general, intervention packages included condom promotion, STI management, 
needle/syringe exchange, detoxification, peer education, health education and counseling, resting/recreation 
facilities, community awareness, and local level advocacy. In addition, the Government of Bangladesh, 
under the direct supervision of NASP, has taken the initiative to provide optimum care and management to 
people living with HIV through care, support, and treatment services at government and NGO facilities. An 
AIDS Epidemic Model analysis conducted to examine the impact of interventions concluded that early 
response to HIV/AIDS helped to maintain a low prevalence in Bangladesh. The analysis demonstrated that 
up to 2014 the ongoing interventions have averted a total of 141,225 HIV infections and saved 3,841,000 
Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) and 19,545 lives (MIS 2015). 
Bangladesh has been conducting serological surveillance and behavioral surveys since 1999. These 
surveys provide data to better understand and address the HIV situation at both the national and sub-national 
levels. They thereby aid in the design of prevention, treatment, care, and support programs. Since 1998, 
serological surveillance surveys of most-at-risk groups have been conducted approximately every two years. 
According to the latest Serological Surveillance (NASP 2012) in Bangladesh, HIV prevalence among 
persons who use drugs, female sex workers, male sex workers, men who have sex with men, and hijras is 
0.7 percent with IDUs in Dhaka city have the highest prevalence (5.3 percent). A recent study also observed 
that the number of HIV cases among IDUs in Dhaka city is increasing rapidly (NASP et al. 2014). 
Bangladesh has been implementing HIV prevention programs through awareness-raising activities 
since 1987, a time when there were no identified cases of HIV in the country. Over the years, the HIV 
program has grown in size and quality and has involved a wider network of stakeholders. The program has 
increased its coverage of most-at-risk populations, which now include young people. There have been 
various efforts to prevent HIV transmission, such as public health education through the media and program 
activities by both government and NGOs, particularly with groups considered to be at high risk for 
transmission of HIV/AIDS. In addition, adolescent and young people age 11-24 have been targeted through 
providing life-skills training to peer leaders. Integrating life-skills based education in secondary school 
curriculums is a major accomplishment to reach adolescents with messages on HIV/AIDS prevention. 
 HIV/AIDS-related Knowledge, Attitudes, and Behavior  •  177 
Because Bangladesh is a low-prevalence country, with HIV not posing an immediate threat, no 
special focus has been placed on the general population. Instead, the focus continues to be mainly on high-
risk groups. This chapter presents current levels of knowledge and attitudes regarding HIV/AIDS prevention 
and transmission in the general population of women of reproductive age. This chapter also discusses self-
reported prevalence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and symptoms including care-seeking 
behaviors. 
12.1 KNOWLEDGE OF HIV/AIDS AND TRANSMISSION AND PREVENTION METHODS 
12.1.1 Knowledge of HIV/AIDS 
The 2014 BDHS included a series of questions to 
gauge respondent’s knowledge and attitudes concerning 
HIV/AIDS. All ever-married women age 15-49 were first 
asked if they had ever heard of AIDS. Those who had 
heard of AIDS were then questioned on their knowledge 
of HIV transmission and prevention. 
Table 12.1 shows that 70 percent of ever-married 
women age 15-49 have heard of HIV/AIDS, the same level 
as documented in the 2011 BDHS. Awareness of 
HIV/AIDS varies by age, with women under age 30 being 
more aware of the disease than older women. Knowledge 
of HIV/AIDS is higher among urban than rural women (85 
compared with 64 percent). Awareness of HIV/AIDS 
ranges from a high of 77 percent among women in Khulna 
to 60 percent in Sylhet. Nearly all women who have 
completed secondary education (99 percent) have heard of 
HIV/AIDS compared with 40 percent of women with no 
education. The proportion of ever-married women who 
have ever heard of AIDS increases steadily as women’s 
wealth status increases. 
12.1.2 Knowledge of HIV Prevention Methods 
HIV/AIDS prevention programs focus their 
messages and efforts on two important aspects of sexual 
behavior: limiting the number of partners and staying 
faithful to one uninfected partner; and using condoms. To 
ascertain 
whether 
programs 
have 
effectively 
communicated these messages, the 2014 BDHS asked 
respondents specific questions about whether it is possible to reduce the chances of getting the AIDS virus 
by using a condom at every sexual encounter and by limiting sexual intercourse to one uninfected partner. 
Table 12.2 shows that 51 percent of ever-married women say that HIV infection can be reduced by 
limiting sex to one uninfected partner who has no other partners, while 42 percent cite using condoms at 
every sexual encounter, and 34 percent are aware of both means of reducing the risk of HIV infection. 
However, there has been a slight decline in knowledge of HIV prevention methods; the proportion of ever-
married women who know about both methods of HIV prevention decreased from 37 percent in 2011 to 34 
percent in 2014. 
Knowledge of the various methods of HIV/AIDS prevention varies by respondent’s age; women 
age 20-24 and women age 25-29 are more knowledgeable than older women. Knowledge of HIV/AIDS 
prevention methods is higher among urban women than rural women, and higher among women in Dhaka 
compared with other districts. Knowledge of HIV/AIDS prevention methods increases with women’s 
education and wealth status.

12.1.3 Comprehensive Knowledge about AIDS 
Comprehensive knowledge about HIV/AIDS is a useful composite measure, combining 
understanding on HIV prevention methods and local misconceptions. The 2014 BDHS collected information 
on common misconceptions about HIV transmission. Respondents were asked whether they think it is 
possible for a healthy-looking person to have HIV, and also whether they believe HIV can be transmitted 
through mosquito bites, or by sharing food with a person who has HIV or AIDS. Comprehensive knowledge 
about AIDS is defined as knowing that consistent condom use and having just one faithful partner can reduce 
the chance of getting the AIDS virus, knowing that a healthy-looking person can have the AIDS virus, and 
rejecting the two most common local misconceptions about HIV transmission in Bangladesh: that HIV can 
be transmitted by mosquito bites and that HIV can be transmitted by sharing food with a person who has 
AIDS. 
The data presented in Table 12.3 indicate that many ever-married women age 15-49 in Bangladesh 
lack accurate knowledge about the ways in which the AIDS virus can and cannot be transmitted. Less than 
half of ever-married women (47 percent) know that a healthy-looking person can have HIV, and 38 percent 
 HIV/AIDS-related Knowledge, Attitudes, and Behavior  •  179 
know that HIV cannot be transmitted by mosquito bites. Thirty-six percent of women correctly believe that 
a person cannot become infected by sharing food with a person who has AIDS. Overall, only 11 percent of 
ever-married women have comprehensive knowledge about AIDS. Comprehensive knowledge about AIDS 
is higher among married women and urban residents than among other women. Among administrative 
divisions, comprehensive AIDS knowledge is the highest in Dhaka (14 percent) and the lowest in Sylhet (6 
percent). Comprehensive knowledge about AIDS increases with education, from 4 percent among women 
with no education to 27 percent among women who have completed secondary or higher education. 
Comprehensive knowledge about AIDS also increases with household wealth. The proportion of ever-
married women who have comprehensive knowledge about AIDS remained unchanged between surveys in 
2011 and 2014. The proportion of women who correctly reject local misconceptions also remained 
unchanged between the two surveys, except for the proportion of ever-married women who correctly believe 
that HIV cannot be transmitted by mosquito bites, which increased from 32 to 38 percent.

12.2 KNOWLEDGE ABOUT MOTHER-TO-CHILD TRANSMISSION OF HIV 
To assess the level of knowledge about mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV, the 2014 
BDHS asked ever-married women age 15-49 whether HIV can be transmitted from a mother to a child during 
pregnancy, during delivery, or through breastfeeding. Table 12.4 shows that 56 percent of ever-married 
women know that HIV can be transmitted during pregnancy, while 44 percent of women know that HIV can 
be transmitted during delivery, and 55 percent of women know that HIV can be transmitted through 
breastfeeding. Knowledge about MTCT of HIV during pregnancy and delivery has decreased slightly since 
2011, when 59 percent of women knew that HIV can be transmitted during pregnancy and 48 percent knew 
about MTCT during delivery. However, the proportion of ever-married women who know that HIV can be 
transmitted through breastfeeding has remained almost unchanged between BDHS 2011 and BDHS 2014. 
Knowledge of MTCT of HIV is highest among women age 20-24, women living in Khulna, 
currently married women, pregnant women, and women living in urban areas. Like other aspects of 
HIV/AIDS knowledge, women’s knowledge about MTCT increases with their educational level and wealth 
status.

12.3 KNOWLEDGE OF MEANS OF TRANSMISSION OF HIV 
To ascertain women’s knowledge about nonsexual means of transmission of HIV, the survey asked 
respondents whether it is possible to get the AIDS virus by using an unsterilized needle or syringe or by 
receiving an unsafe blood transfusion. Table 12.5 shows that 63 percent of ever-married women age 15-49 
know that the AIDS virus can be transmitted by using an unsterilized needle or syringe, while 61 percent of 
women know that the AIDS virus can be transmitted through blood transfusion. Fifty-nine percent of ever-
married women know both of these means of HIV transmission. The proportion of women who know both 
means of HIV transmission decreased slightly between 2011 and 2014, from 61 to 59 percent. 
There are considerable variations in knowledge of HIV transmission by women’s background 
characteristics. Knowledge is higher among younger women, married women, urban women, women living 
in Khulna, women who have completed secondary or higher education, and women in the highest wealth 
quintile.

12.4 ATTITUDE TOWARD NEGOTIATING SAFE SEXUAL RELATIONS WITH HUSBANDS 
An important determinant of practicing safer sexual relations is control over one’s sexual rights and 
preferences. Knowledge about HIV transmission and ways to prevent it are of little use if women feel 
powerless to negotiate safer sex practices with their husbands. To assess a woman’s ability to negotiate safer 
sex, the 2014 BDHS asked respondents if they think that a wife is justified in refusing to have sex with her 
husband when she knows he has a disease that can be transmitted through sexual contact. 
Table 12.6 shows that the great majority of ever-married women (91 percent) think that if a woman 
knows her husband has a sexually transmitted infection (STI), she is justified in refusing to have sex with 
him. This percentage remains the same as in the 2011 BDHS. There are small variations in women’s attitudes 
toward negotiating safer sex with their husbands by background characteristics. Among administrative 
divisions, the proportion of women who support a woman’s right to refuse sex ranges from 87 percent in 
Sylhet and Rangpur to 95 percent in Rajshahi. It is important to note that among ever-married women with 
no education 87 percent say that a woman is justified in refusing to have sex with her husband if she knows 
he has an STI, nearly as high as the 93 percent of women with a secondary or higher level of education. 
Similarly, 90 percent of women in the lowest wealth quintile support women’s right to refuse sex, only 5 
percentage points lower than for women in the highest wealth quintile (95 percent).

12.5 SELF-REPORTED PREVALENCE OF SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS (STIS) AND 
STI SYMPTOMS 
In the 2014 BDHS, respondents who ever had sex were asked if they had gotten a disease through 
sexual contact in the previous 12 months or if they had experienced either of two symptoms associated with 
sexually transmitted infections (STIs), that is, a bad-smelling or abnormal genital discharge, or a genital sore 
or ulcer. Table 12.7 shows the self-reported prevalence of STIs and STI symptoms among ever-married 
women age 15-49. 
Overall, only 0.5 percent of ever-married women age 15-49 responded that they had an STI in the 
12 months preceding the survey. It is likely that this figure underestimates the actual prevalence of STIs 
among sexually active women in Bangladesh, as many STI symptoms are not easily recognized and many 
STIs do not have visible symptoms.

Self-reported prevalence of STIs and/or STI symptoms among women has decreased by 1 
percentage point since 2011. In the 2014 BDHS, 14 percent of ever-married women report having had an 
STI and/or symptoms of an STI in the 12 months before the survey. Women who report STI symptoms are 
somewhat more likely to say they have had a bad-smelling or abnormal genital discharge (11 percent) than 
a genital ulcer or sore (5 percent). The proportion of women having a genital sore or ulcer in the 12 months 
before the survey decreased by 2 percentage points during the last three years. There is a small variation in 
the prevalence of STIs and/or STI symptoms by women’s background characteristics. Among divisions, the 
percentage of women reporting an STI and/or STI symptoms is highest in Barisal and Khulna (17 percent) 
and lowest in Rangpur and Dhaka (12 percent). 
When women reported having an STI, STI symptoms, or both in the past 12 months, the 2014 BDHS 
interviewer asked whether they sought any advice or treatment for it. Figure 12.2 shows that care seeking 
for treatment of STIs improved between 2011 and 2014. The proportion of women who sought advice or 
treatment from a clinic, hospital, private doctor, or other health professional increased from 31 percent in 
2011 to 46 percent in 2014. The proportion of women who sought advice or medicine from a pharmacy 
increased from 8 to 11 percent between two surveys. In contrast, care seeking from other sources for 
treatment of STIs decreased substantially, from 18 to 7 percent. The proportion of women who sought no 
advice or treatment for STIs also decreased between surveys, from 45 to 39 percent.

WOMEN’S EMPOWERMENT AND  
HEALTH SEEKING BEHAVIOR

he issue of women’s empowerment has a long history, but many say that gender equity is not yet 
established throughout the world (Bhasin 1993; Begum et al. 1990). Achieving gender equity is not 
a straightforward goal that can be attained readily. Against this backdrop, the 1994 International 
Conference on Population and Development declared, “advancing gender equality and equity and the 
empowerment of women and the elimination of all kinds of violence against women, and ensuring women’s 
ability to control their own fertility are cornerstones of population and development-related programs” 
(UNFPA 1994). Women’s empowerment has been defined to encompass women having a sense of self-
worth, access to opportunities and resources, choices and the ability to exercise them, control over their own 
lives, and influence over the direction of social change (United Nations Population Information Network 
1995). 
According to the United Nations Development Program’s (UNDP) Human Development Report for 
2013, Bangladesh ranks 115 out of 187 countries on the Gender Inequality Index, which is defined in the 
report as “a composite measure reflecting inequality in achievements between women and men in three 
dimensions: reproductive health, empowerment, and the labor market” (UNDP 2013). The 2014 Global 
Gender Gap Index, developed by the World Economic Forum, ranks Bangladesh 68 out of 142 countries in 
terms of gender equality (World Economic Forum 2014). Thus, Bangladesh ranks among the bottom half of 
countries included in each gender-related index. Women make up half of the total population and women’s 
labor force participation is increasing more than ever compared with men’s (BBS 2013). Women need much 
attention from all concerned if they are to achieve the desired levels of empowerment, even though women’s 
right to equality is considered as one of the fundamental themes of the Constitution of Bangladesh (Ministry 
of Women and Children Affairs 2010). 
Empowerment and autonomy of women are essential for the achievement of sustainable 
development. The full participation and partnership of both women and men is required in productive and 
reproductive life, including sharing responsibilities for the care and nurture of children as well as for the 
maintenance of households. In Bangladesh, women’s empowerment is high on the list of priority 
improvements sought in the social and economic conditions of its people. As of today, the government of 
Bangladesh has formulated four statements of the National Women’s Policy (1997, 2004, 2008, and 2011) 
T 
Key Findings 
• Thirty-two percent of currently married employed women who earn cash 
make decisions mainly by themselves on how to use their own earnings. 
• Seventy percent of currently married women go alone or with children to 
the health center or hospital, an increase from 56 percent in 2011. 
• Forty-four percent of currently married women participate in all four types 
of decisions regarding their own health care, their child’s health care, 
major household purchases, and visits to their family or relatives. 
• Twenty-eight percent of women agree with one or more reasons 
justifying wife beating. One in five women thinks wife beating is justified if 
she argues with her husband. 
•  Active involvement in household decision-making has a positive bearing 
on a woman’s use of contraceptives. 
• Access to antenatal care, postnatal care, and delivery assistance from a 
medically trained provider increases with a higher score on the women’s 
empowerment indices. 
 188  •  Women’s Empowerment and Health Seeking Behavior 
to empower women at all stages (Ministry of Women and Children Affairs 2011). These policies have 
successfully identified the crux of the problems related to socioeconomic, administrative, political, and legal 
empowerment of women. In addition, Bangladesh ratified the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms 
of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) in 1984, for all four sections, and has committed to all optional 
protocols of this charter to ensure women’s empowerment, after the United Nations adopted this charter in 
1979. The main idea is to eliminate all discrimination against women that exists at institutional levels 
(Ministry of Women and Children Affairs 2010). 
A number of studies show that women lag behind men in educational attainment, literacy, 
employment, and exposure to mass media (Ahmed and Khatun 2008; Khatun and Cornwell 2009; Khatun 
2009). Achievements in these areas are crucial contributors to women’s empowerment. At the individual 
level, education, employment, and exposure to mass media all exert considerable influence on the 
development of a woman’s opportunities and sense of self-worth can help strengthen her position in the 
household and in the society. 
This chapter discusses indicators of women’s empowerment including employed women’s control 
over their own earnings, women’s freedom of movement, women’s participation in household decisions, and 
women’s acceptance of wife beating. In addition, two summary indicators of women’s empowerment are 
defined: an index of the number of household decisions (0-4) in which the respondent participates and an 
index of the number of reasons (0-5) the respondent accepts as justifying wife beating. The ranking of women 
on these two indices is then related to selected demographic and health outcomes including contraceptive 
use, ideal family size, unmet need for family planning, and receipt of health care services during pregnancy, 
at delivery, and in the postnatal period. 
13.1 EMPLOYMENT AND FORM OF EARNINGS 
Employment, particularly employment for cash, and control over how earnings are used are 
important indicators of women’s empowerment. In the 2014 BDHS, currently married women were asked 
whether they were employed at the time of the survey and, if not, whether they were employed at any time 
during the 12 months preceding the survey. Table 13.1 shows the percentage of currently married women 
age 15-49 who were employed at any time in the 12 months preceding the survey, and the percent distribution 
of employed women by the type of earnings they received (cash, in-kind, cash and in-kind, or neither). 
Thirty-four percent of currently married women age 15-49 reported some forms of employment in 
the past 12 months. By age, employment increases from 17 percent among women age 15-19 to 42 percent 
among women age 40-44, before declining to 39 percent in the oldest group (age 45-49). As age increases, 
the difference in employment between age group decreases, from 10 percentage points between women age 
15-19 and women age 20-24, to 8 percentage points between women age 20-24 and women age 25-29. Then 
this difference decreases to 1 or 2 percentage points among the older age groups. 
The popular assumption is that employment and payment for work come together, but not all women 
receive earnings for the work they do. Even among women who receive earnings, not all are paid in cash. 
Eighty-five percent of employed women are paid in cash, 6 percent receive both cash and in-kind earnings, 
1 percent have in-kind earnings only, and 8 percent are not paid at all for their work. Older women are more 
likely to report cash and in-kind earnings compared with younger employed women, while younger women 
are more likely to report earning cash only. For instance, 9 percent of women age 45-49 reported that they 
receive cash and in-kind earnings compared with 2 percent of women age 15-19. On the other hand, 89 
percent of women age 15-19 reported receiving cash only compared with 79 percent of women age 45-49.

13.2 WOMEN’S CONTROL OVER THEIR OWN EARNINGS 
One main component of measuring women’s empowerment is whether women have control over 
their earnings. To assess control over earnings, the survey asked currently married women with cash earnings 
in the past 12 months about who makes the main decision about the use of their earnings. If women are able 
to control how their own cash earnings are used, they are more likely to have a greater say in using other 
household resources. 
Table 13.2 shows the percent distribution of currently married women who received cash earnings 
in the past 12 months, according to the person who mainly decides about the use of their earnings. Thirty-
two percent of currently married women who earn cash reported that they themselves mainly decide how 
their cash earnings are used; 54 percent reported that they decide jointly with their husbands, and 13 percent 
reported that their husbands alone decide how their earnings are used. A very low percentage of women 
reported that other people participate in the decision on how their earnings are used. Women age 45-49 are 
less likely to make their own decisions about how to use their earnings than their younger counterparts (28 
percent compared with 34 percent of women age 15-19). However, as age increases, women are more likely 
to make decisions jointly with their husbands. Women with lower parity are more likely to make decisions 
about their earnings alone compared with women with higher parity, while women with higher parity are 
more likely to make decisions jointly with their husbands. Urban women are more likely than rural women 
to make decisions themselves about spending their earnings (39 percent versus 29 percent). As expected, 
rural women are more likely than urban women to report that their husbands alone make decisions about the 
use of their earnings (14 percent versus 10 percent). 
A substantial variation in who makes decisions on how women’s earnings is observed across 
administrative divisions in the 2014 BDHS. The proportion of employed women who mainly decide by 
themselves about the use of their earnings ranges from 45 percent in Barisal to 20 percent in Rangpur, and 
joint decision-making ranges from 41 percent in Barisal to 61 percent in Rangpur. The 2014 BDHS data 
provide consistent findings about women of Barisal and Rangpur. If a woman decides alone about her 
earnings, she is less likely to report joint decision-making, and vice versa. The proportion of women who 
reported that decisions about their earnings are made mainly by their husbands ranges from 10 percent in 
Dhaka to 17 percent in Rajshahi. 
Women’s decision-making power about their earnings increases with their level of education and 
household wealth. Forty-three percent of women who have completed secondary or higher education mainly 
make the decision by themselves on how to use the money they earn compared with 28 percent of women 
with no education. Women with no education and those who completed primary school are more likely than 
other women to decide jointly with their husbands (56 percent and 58 percent, respectively) about the use of 
their earnings. Forty-one percent of women in the highest wealth quintile mainly decide by themselves about 
the use of their earnings compared with 23 percent of women in the lowest wealth quintile.

13.3 FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT 
Freedom of movement outside the home is an important indicator of women’s autonomy and 
empowerment. Bangladesh embraces a traditional culture with patriarchal values secluding women from the 
outside world and from men, popularly known as “purdah.” This is particularly true in rural areas. The 2014 
BDHS asked currently married women whether they go to a health center or hospital or, if they do not go, 
whether they can go alone or with their young children to a health center or hospital. Table 13.3 shows that 
70 percent of women said that they go alone or with their young children to a health center or hospital, and 
10 percent of women who do not go to a health center or hospital said that they can go to these health facilities 
alone or with their children. Comparison of data from the 2007 BDHS, 2011 BDHS, and 2014 BDHS shows 
that in 2014 a higher proportion of women reported going alone or with children to a health center or a 
hospital. Consequently, fewer women now report constraints in going to a health center or hospital, either 
alone or with their children (NIPORT et al. 2009, 2013). 
The proportion of women who go to a health center or a hospital alone or with children increases 
with age, from 43 percent of women age 15-19 to 80 percent of women age 35-39, while the proportion of 
women who cannot go alone or accompanied by their children decreases with age, from 41 percent among 
women age 15-19 to 16 percent among women age 45-49. Urban women, women with three or four children, 
 Women’s Empowerment and Health Seeking Behavior  •  191 
women who have completed a secondary or higher level of education, and women in the highest wealth 
quintile are more likely than their counterparts to go to a health facility, either alone or with their children. 
Rural women and women in Sylhet are more likely to be among those who cannot go to a health facility 
alone or accompanied by their young children.

13.4 WOMEN’S EMPOWERMENT 
The 2014 BDHS collected information from women on other measures of women’s autonomy and 
status. In particular, the survey asked women about their participation in household decisions and their 
attitudes toward gender roles. Such information provides insight into women’s control over household 
resources and environment, factors that are relevant to understanding women’s demographic and health 
behavior. 
The ability of women to make decisions that affect the personal circumstances of their own lives is 
an essential aspect of empowerment and serves as an important contributor to women’s overall welfare. To 
assess currently married women’s decision-making autonomy, the 2014 BDHS collected information on 
women’s participation in four types of decisions: their own health care, major household purchases, their 
child’s health care, and visits to their family or relatives. Table 13.4 shows the percent distribution of 
 192  •  Women’s Empowerment and Health Seeking Behavior 
currently married women age 15-49 by the person in the household who usually makes decisions concerning 
these matters. 
Table 13.4 shows that just over half of women make each of the four types of decisions jointly with 
their husbands. About three in ten currently married women reported that their husbands are the main 
decision-makers about their health care, major household purchases, and visits to family or relatives. Women 
have more say in decisions related to their children’s health care; 16 percent reported that they mainly make 
these decisions, and 17 percent reported that their husbands mainly make these decisions. Few women (8 
percent) make decisions about major household purchases alone compared with 28 percent whose husbands 
mainly make purchasing decisions. Ten percent of women reported that someone else makes such 
decisions—a higher percentage than for women’s own decision-making about household purchases. Overall, 
women’s decision-making power for all four specified issues has increased since 2007 (NIPORT et al. 2009; 
NIPORT et al. 2013).

Table 13.5 shows how currently married women’s participation (alone or jointly) in decision-
making varies by background characteristics. The table presents results for the four specific types of 
decisions, namely women’s own health care, making major household purchases, child’s health care, and 
visits to the woman’s family or relatives. In addition, the table includes two summary indicators: the 
proportion of women involved in making all four decisions and the proportion not involved in making any 
of the four decisions. 
About three in five currently married women participate in each of the four types of decision, either 
alone or jointly with their husbands. Forty-four percent participate in all four decisions, and 16 percent do 
not participate in any of the decisions. 
Women’s participation in all four decisions varies by background characteristics. Participation in 
decision-making in general increases with age. Women age 15-19 reported the least involvement in making 
all four decisions compared with women in all other age groups. As expected, employed women who have 
cash earnings are more likely to participate in all four decisions than women who are not employed (48 
percent versus 42 percent). Compared with women who have children, women with no children are less 
likely to participate in all four household decisions (10 percent compared with 46 percent or higher). Urban 
women are more likely to participate in all four decisions than rural women (47 percent versus 42 percent). 
Among administrative divisions, Sylhet has the lowest proportion of women who participate in all 
four decisions (33 percent) and the highest percentage of women who do not participate in any of the four 
types of decisions (24 percent). Women’s participation in decision-making does not vary greatly by 
education or wealth, although women who have completed secondary or higher education (46 percent) and 
women in the highest wealth quintile (47 percent) are most likely to participate in all four decisions.

Women may have a say in some, but not all decisions. The number of decisions that a woman makes 
by herself or jointly with her husband is positively related to women’s empowerment and reflects the degree

the percent distribution of currently married women according to the number of decisions in which they

13.5 ATTITUDES TOWARD WIFE BEATING 
The critical problems that women face are many and diverse. One of the most serious is violence, 
and Bangladesh is no exception in this regard. The nature and extent of violence makes it as an internationally 
recognized issue for women’s disempowerment (Akand and Shamim 1995; Ameen 2005). In Bangladesh, 
an estimated three in every five women experience violence including physical or sexual violence (Naved 
and Amin, ed. 2013). One of the most common forms of violence against women worldwide is abuse by the 
husband or partner (Heise et al. 1999). The 2014 BDHS obtained information on women’s attitudes toward 
wife beating by asking women about their opinion on whether a husband is justified in hitting or beating his 
wife under a series of circumstances: if she burns the food, if she argues with him, if she goes out without 
telling him, if she neglects the children, and if she refuses to have sexual intercourse with him. 
A woman’s attitude toward wife beating is considered a proxy for her perception of women’s status. 
A lower score on the “number of reasons wife beating is justified” indicates a woman’s greater sense of 
entitlement, self-esteem, and status and reflects positively on her sense of empowerment. Agreement with 
wife beating as justified indicates that a woman generally accepts the right of a man to control her behavior 
even by means of violence. Such a perception could act as a barrier to accessing health care for her children 
and herself, affect her attitude toward contraceptive use, and have an impact on her general well-being. 
Table 13.6 shows the percentage of ever-married women age 15-49 who agree that a husband is 
justified in hitting or beating his wife for specific reasons, by background characteristics. Twenty-eight 
percent of women agree that a husband is justified in beating his wife for at least one of the reasons listed. 
The most widely accepted reason for wife beating among women in Bangladesh is arguing with her 
husband (20 percent), followed by neglecting the children (15 percent). Fourteen percent of women agree 
that going out without telling her husband is a justifiable reason for a husband to beat his wife. Seven percent 
of women agree that refusing to have sexual intercourse is an acceptable reason for a husband to beat his 
wife, and 4 percent of women agree that a husband is justified in beating his wife if she burns the food. 
Agreement with at least one reason for wife beating varies little by age or marital status. Women 
who are employed and are paid in cash (29 percent), reside in urban areas (25 percent), reside in Dhaka (24 
percent), have completed secondary or higher education (16 percent), and are in households in the highest 
wealth quintile (19 percent) are less likely than most other women to agree with at least one reason for wife

beating. This result is supported by the 2007 BDHS results, which found that having little education, living 
in rural areas, having multiple marriages, and having limited access to wealth are strongly and positively 
associated with experiencing all kinds of domestic violence on the part of women (NIPORT et al. 2009; 
Naved and Amin, ed. 2013).

13.6 INDICATORS OF WOMEN’S EMPOWERMENT 
Women’s empowerment has important implications for demographic and health outcomes, 
including women’s use of family planning and maternal health care services. To examine how selected 
demographic and health outcomes vary by women’s empowerment, information on women’s participation 
in household decision-making and their attitudes toward wife beating are summarized in two separate 
indices. 
 196  •  Women’s Empowerment and Health Seeking Behavior 
The first index is the number of decisions (0-4) women participate in, alone or jointly with their 
husbands (see Table 13.4 for the list of decisions). This index is positively related to women’s empowerment 
and reflects the degree of control that women are able to exercise through making decisions in areas that 
affect their own lives and environments. 
The second index is the number of reasons (0-5) for which women justify a husband beating his 
wife (see Table 13.6 for the list of reasons). A lower score on this index is interpreted as reflecting a greater 
sense of entitlement, higher self-esteem, and a higher status of women. 
In general, it is expected that women who participate in making household decisions are also more 
likely to have gender-egalitarian beliefs and to reject wife beating. Accordingly, Table 13.7 provides an 
overview on how these two basic empowerment indices—number of decisions in which women participate 
and number of reasons for which wife beating is justified—relate to one another. 
Women’s rejection of all the reasons for wife beating varies only somewhat by the number of 
decisions they participate in. Specifically, 67-70 percent of women who participate in 0-3 decisions reject 
all the reasons for wife beating compared with 76 percent of women who participate in all four decisions. 
However, the proportion of women who participate in all four decisions does not vary uniformly with the 
number of reasons for which wife beating is justified. The percentage of women who participate in all four 
decisions is highest (46 percent) for women who do not agree with any reason for wife beating and falls to 
36 percent for women who agree with 3-4 reasons for wife beating, and to 32 percent for women who agree 
with all five reasons for wife beating.

13.7 CURRENT USE OF CONTRACEPTION BY WOMEN’S EMPOWERMENT 
The 2014 BDHS asked whether women were using contraception or not at the time of the survey. 
Three in every five currently married women use contraceptive methods (See Chapter 7, Fertility Regulation, 
Table 7.1). A woman’s desire and ability to control her fertility and the contraceptive method she chooses 
are likely to be affected by her status in the household, her self-image, and her own sense of empowerment. 
A woman who feels that she is unable to control other aspects of her life may be less likely to feel that she 
can make and carry out decisions about her fertility. She may also feel the need to choose methods that can 
be hidden from others or that do not depend on her husband’s cooperation. Table 13.8 shows the distribution 
of married women age 15-49 by the type of contraceptive method used, by the two indicators of women’s 
empowerment. 
 Women’s Empowerment and Health Seeking Behavior  •  197 
Women’s participation in household decision-making has a positive bearing on contraceptive use. 
The more decisions a woman participates in, the more likely she is to use a contraceptive method. Both use 
of any method and use of any modern method are higher among women who participate in all four decisions 
(67 percent and 57 percent, respectively) compared with women who participate in no decisions (53 percent 
and 47 percent, respectively). Nonetheless, one-third of women who participate in all four types of decision-
making do not use any contraceptive method, implying that participation in making household decisions 
does not necessarily translate into taking action on a major choice like contraceptive use. 
The relationship between attitudes about wife beating and use of contraception is not clear. These 
two issues seem to be related to each other, but the variations in contraceptive use by number of reasons 
women agree with for justifying wife beating are small.

13.8 IDEAL FAMILY SIZE AND UNMET NEED BY WOMEN’S EMPOWERMENT 
The inclusion of women in the development process is important in Bangladesh. However, this is 
not universally recognized in the country. The ability of women to make decisions effectively has important 
implications for their fertility preferences and for meeting their family-size goals. The general expectation 
is that more empowered women will desire smaller families and be better able to negotiate decisions about 
fertility and family planning. Hence, unmet for family planning, which reflects women’s unsatisfied need 
for contraception, should be lower among more empowered women. 
Table 13.9 shows how women’s ideal family size and their unmet need for family planning vary by 
the two indicators of women’s empowerment. The mean ideal family size shows no variation by the number 
of decisions in which women participate, but increases somewhat with the number of reasons women give 
that justify wife beating. The pattern remains the same as in the 2011 BDHS (NIPORT et al. 2013). Women 
who agree that wife beating is not justified for any reason desire 2.2 children compared with 2.4 children for 
women who agree that wife beating is justified for all five reasons. 
The 2014 BDHS shows that women’s participation in decision-making is associated with their level 
of unmet need for family planning. Women who participate in no household decisions have a slightly higher 
level of unmet need for family planning (15 percent) compared with women who participate in one or more 
decisions (11-12 percent). The total unmet need for family planning is similar, at 11-12 percent, among 
women who do not justify wife beating for any reason, 1-2 reasons, or 3-4 reasons. The percentage is higher 
for women who agree with five reasons justifying wife beating (14 percent).

13.9 REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE BY WOMEN’S EMPOWERMENT 
Table 13.10 examines whether empowered women are more likely to access antenatal, delivery, and 
postnatal care services from medically trained health personnel. In societies where health care is widespread, 
women’s empowerment may not affect their access to reproductive health services. In other societies, 
however, increased empowerment of women is likely to increase their ability to seek out and use health 
services from qualified health providers in meeting their own reproductive health goals, including safe 
motherhood. The table includes only women who had a birth in the three years preceding the survey and 
examines their access to antenatal care, delivery care, and postnatal care from trained health personnel for 
their most recent birth. 
Both indicators of women’s empowerment are related to women’s access to reproductive health care 
for their most recent birth. For example, the proportion of women receiving antenatal care from a medically 
trained provider increases from 61 percent among women who participate in no decisions to 65 percent 
among women who participate in all four types of decisions. The corresponding proportion of women 
receiving delivery assistance from a medically trained provider increases from 40 percent among women 
who participate in no decisions to 44 percent among women who participate in all four decisions.  Similarly, 
the proportion of women receiving postnatal care within two days of delivery from a medically trained 
provider increases from 34 percent among women who participate in no decisions to 37 percent among 
women who participate in all four types of decisions. 
Women’s attitude toward wife beating is also related to their use of reproductive health services. 
Women who accept all five reasons for wife beating are much less likely than women who agree with no 
reason for wife beating to receive any of the three types of maternal care from a medically trained provider. 
Forty-two percent of women who agree with all five reasons justifying wife beating received antenatal care 
from a medically trained provider compared with 68 percent of women who do not agree with any of the 
reasons. Sixteen percent of women who agree with all five reasons received delivery care from a medically 
trained provider compared with 47 percent of women who do not agree with any of the reasons. Fifteen 
percent of women who agree with all five reasons received postnatal care from a medically trained provider 
within the first two days after delivery compared with 40 percent of women who do not agree with any of 
the reasons justifying wife-beating.

Note: If more than one source of antenatal care was mentioned, only the provider with the highest qualifications is considered in this tabulation. For 
antenatal and postnatal care, medically trained providers include: qualified doctor, nurse/midwife/paramedic, FWV, CSBA, and SACMO. For delivery 
assistance, medically trained providers include= qualified doctor, nurse/midwife/paramedic, FWV, and CSBA.

13.10 INFANT AND CHILD MORTALITY AND WOMEN’S EMPOWERMENT 
The ability of women to access information, make decisions, and act effectively in their own 
interests or in the interests of those who depend on them is an essential aspect of empowerment. It follows 
that if women, who are the primary caretakers of children, are empowered, they will be better able to take 
actions that enhance the health and survival of their children. In fact, mother’s empowerment fits into the 
Mosley-Chen framework on child survival as an intervening individual-level variable that affects child 
survival through proximate determinants (Mosley and Chen 1984). 
Table 13.11 shows infant mortality, child mortality, and under five-mortality rates by women’s 
participation in decision-making and women’s attitude about wife-beating. There is no clear pattern in the 
relationship between participation in decision-making and childhood mortality rates. Children of women 
who participate in 1-2 decisions have a higher mortality rate than children of women who do not participate 
in any decisions or who participate in 3-4 decisions. 
Childhood mortality increases sharply with women’s agreement with reasons for wife beating from 
none to 1-2. For example, under-five mortality for children of women who do not agree with any reason for 
wife beating is 42 deaths per 1,000 live births, but increases to 63 deaths per 1,000 live births for children of 
women who agree with 1-2 reasons justifying wife beating. The three childhood mortality rates are lowest 
for children of women who agree with 3-4 reasons for wife beating and highest for children of women who 
agree with all five reasons for wife beating.

COMMUNITY CHARACTERISTICS

n the 2014 BDHS, the Community Questionnaire was administered in each of the selected clusters 
during the household listing operation. The community survey collected data on characteristics of the 
selected sample clusters, such as distance to upazila headquarters, school, and post office, as well as on 
the accessibility of health and family planning services that are located within or near the cluster. Another 
objective for conducting the community survey was to generate a list of health facilities in the sample clusters 
and a list of health and family planning fieldworkers who cover the cluster, including the identification of 
their affiliation (government or non-government). These lists were later provided to the main survey 
interviewing teams to help identify the specific sources of services used by the respondents. 
The Community Questionnaire was administered to a group of four to six key informants who were 
knowledgeable about the socioeconomic conditions and the availability of health and family planning 
services or facilities in the cluster. The key informants included community leaders, teachers, government 
officials, social workers, religious leaders, traditional healers, and health care providers, etc. Distance to 
facilities was measured in kilometers (km) from the center of each sample cluster. All interviewed women 
in the sample area were assumed to have the same distance from the facility.

Key Findings 
• Eighty percent of women live in a village/mohalla where there is a 
primary school, and the remaining 20 percent have access to a primary 
school within a distance of 1-4 km. Coeducational high schools are much 
more widespread than either a boys’ or a girls’ high school. 
• Eighty-seven percent of ever-married women age 15-49 live in 
villages/mohallas that have a Grameen Bank. Women in rural areas are 
more likely than women in urban areas to have access to a Grameen 
Bank (89 percent versus 83 percent). 
• Eighty-seven percent of sample clusters have a health facility within 1 
km. This percentage is almost same in rural and in urban areas (87 and 
88 percent, respectively). 
• Satellite clinics are also widely available; 76 percent of clusters have a 
satellite clinic available within 1 km; 78 percent in rural areas and 69 
percent in urban areas. 
• Thirty-five percent of the clusters have a government health facility within 
1 km; 40 percent in rural areas and 24 percent in urban areas. NGO and 
private facilities are more likely to be found in urban clusters. 
• Family planning and health providers are available in 94 percent of 
sample clusters. In both rural and urban areas, these workers are 
predominantly affiliated with the government. 
• More than 4 in 10 clusters have an allopathic/MBBS doctor; 74 percent in 
urban areas and 30 percent in rural areas. Close to 6 in 10 clusters have 
a homeopathic doctor and 4 in 10 clusters have a Unani or Ayurvedic 
doctor. 
• Thirty-six percent of the people in the rural clusters go to their upazila 
headquarters by car, bus, or tempo, which is the most common means of 
transport in all divisions except Chittagong, Rangpur, and Sylhet. 
• Seventy-two percent of the people in the rural clusters go to their district 
headquarters by car, bus, or tempo. 
 202  •  Community Characteristics 
Table 14.1 presents the percent distribution of ever-married women age 15-49 by distance to various 
general services. Overall, 25 percent of ever-married women live less than 1 km from a post office and 67 
percent live 1-4 km from the nearest post office, with a median distance of 2.1 km. Cinema halls are less 
widespread; 8 percent of women have access to a cinema hall within 1 km and 27 percent live 1-4 km from 
the nearest cinema hall, with a median distance of 7.9 km. 
Access to weekly markets was not asked in urban sample clusters because they are not the norm. In 
rural areas 35 percent of women have access to a weekly market less than 1 km away, and 57 percent have 
access within 1-4 km. The median distance to a weekly market in rural areas is 2.0 km. Access to a post 
office is similar in urban and rural areas. However, urban women are much more likely than rural women to 
live close to a cinema hall.

Table 14.2 shows the percent distribution of ever-married women age 15-49 by distance to the 
nearest education facility, according to the type of facility. Religious schools are widespread in Bangladesh; 
58 percent of women live in a village that has a madrasha and 39 percent of women have a madrasha within 
1-4 km. Eighty percent of women live in a village/mohalla where there is a primary school and the remaining 
20 percent have access to a primary school within 1-4 km. Coeducational high schools are much more 
widespread than either a boys’ or a girls’ high school. Overall, 40 percent of women live in a village/mohalla 
where there is a coeducational high school compared with only 17 percent with a boys’ high school and 20 
percent with a girls’ high school. All of the specified educational facilities are more available in urban than 
in rural areas.

 Community Characteristics  •  203 
Informants to the Community Questionnaire were asked whether specific income-generating 
organizations such as the Grameen Bank, Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee (BRAC), 
PROSHIKA, and the Association of Social Advancement (ASA) are available in the village/mohalla, 
because the availability of these organizations may influence women’s reproductive behavior. Table 14.3 
shows that 87 percent of ever-married women age 15-49 live in a village/mohalla that has a Grameen Bank. 
Women in rural areas are more likely than women in urban areas to have access to a Grameen Bank (89 
percent versus 83 percent). However, the other income-generating organizations are more accessible to urban 
women than rural women. For example, 80 percent of women live in a village/mohalla with a BRAC (81 
percent in urban and 79 percent in rural areas). As another example, ASA is available in the village/mohalla 
to 74 percent of women (78 percent in urban areas and 73 percent in rural areas).

Table 14.4 shows the availability of health facilities within a specified distance from the sample 
cluster according to the type of health facility and by urban-rural residence. As Table 14.4 shows, 87 percent 
of clusters have a health facility within 1 km. This percentage is almost same in rural and urban areas (87 
and 88 percent, respectively). Satellite clinics are also widely available; 76 percent of clusters have a satellite 
clinic available within 1 km. Satellite clinics are more common in rural areas (78 percent) than in urban areas 
(69 percent). 
Overall, 35 percent of the 2014 BDHS sample clusters have a government health facility within 1 
km (40 percent in rural areas and 24 percent in urban areas). A private facility is available within 1 km for 
13 percent of clusters (38 percent in urban areas and 3 percent in rural areas). An NGO facility is less 
common. Overall, it is available within 1 km to 9 percent of cluster residents, but much more available in 
urban than in rural areas (26 percent versus 2 percent). In conclusion, the data indicate that government 
facilities are more likely to be available within 1 km in a rural cluster, while NGOs and private facilities are 
more likely to be found in an urban cluster.

1 Government facility includes government hospital, upazila health complex, family welfare center, maternal and 
child welfare center, and community clinic. 
 
Informants to the Community Questionnaire were asked to list the names of health and family 
planning workers who work in the village/mohalla. Table 14.5 shows that family planning and health 
providers are available in almost all sample clusters (94 percent). In both rural and urban areas, health and 
family planning workers are predominantly affiliated with the government. Government health and family 
planning workers are more available in rural areas than in urban areas (96 percent and 61 percent, 
respectively). 
Informants to the Community Questionnaire were also asked about the medical practitioners that 
provide health services in the village/mohalla. More than four in ten clusters have an allopathic/MBBS 
doctor1. MBBS doctors are more common in urban areas than in rural areas (74 percent versus 30 percent). 
Close to six in ten clusters have a homeopathic doctor and four in ten clusters have a Unani or Ayurvedic 
doctor. Both of these alternative practitioners are more common in urban than in rural areas.

Informants to the Community Questionnaire were asked to list the names of “depot holders,” who 
work in the village/mohalla, as well as pharmacies or shops and skilled birth attendants (SBA) that provide 
services to individuals in the village/mohalla. Table 14.6 shows that seven in ten women live in a village 
covered by SBA; 52 percent in urban areas and 76 percent in rural areas. Sixty-five percent of women live 
in a village where there are pharmacies or shops that sell family planning methods. Urban women are much 
more likely than rural women to have a pharmacy or shop in their village (89 percent versus 56 percent). 
Depot holders are available in the cluster to 12 percent of women (10 percent in urban areas and 13 percent 
in rural areas).

common means of transport in all divisions except Chittagong, Rangpur, and Sylhet. Car, bus, or tempo use 
is highest in Khulna (66 percent), followed by Barisal (58 percent) and Rajshahi (47 percent). In Dhaka, the 
most common means of transport is car, bus, or tempo (32 percent), followed by rickshaw or rickshaw van 
(23 percent), and baby taxi (18 percent). Baby taxi use is the most common means of travel to upazila 
headquarters in Chittagong (79 percent) and Sylhet (54 percent). In Rangpur, two types of transport prevail; 
rickshaw or rickshaw van (36 percent) and car, bus, or tempo (34 percent). Overall, motorcycle use is limited

Table 14.8 shows that 72 percent of the people in the rural clusters go to their district headquarters 
by car, bus, or tempo. This mode of transport is the most common in all divisions. The use of car, bus, or 
tempo is highest in Khulna division (91 percent) and lowest in Chittagong (55 percent). In other divisions 
the proportion ranges between 62 percent in Sylhet and 78 percent in Rajshahi. 
Overall, 17 percent of sample cluster residents travel to the district headquarters by baby taxi, which 
is the second most common means of travel to the district headquarters in all the divisions, except Barisal 
division, where motorcycle is the second most common means of travel (6 percent).

SAMPLE DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION 
Appendix A
 
A.1 
INTRODUCTION 
he 2014 Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (2014 BDHS) is the seventh DHS survey 
conducted in Bangladesh, following those implemented in 1993-94, 1996-97, 1999-2000, 2003-04, 
2007-08, and 2010-2011. As with the prior surveys, the main objective of the 2014 BDHS is to 
provide up-to-date information on fertility and childhood mortality levels; fertility preferences; awareness, 
approval, and use of family planning methods; maternal and child health; knowledge and attitudes toward 
HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections (STI); and community-level data on accessibility and 
availability of health and family planning services. All ever-married women age 15-49 who were usual 
members of the selected households and those who spent the night before the survey in the selected 
households are eligible to be interviewed in the survey. The survey was designed to produce representative 
results for the country as a whole, for the urban and the rural areas separately, and for each of the seven 
administrative divisions. 
A.2 
SAMPLING FRAME 
The sampling frame used for the 2014 BDHS is the complete list of enumeration areas (EAs) 
covering the whole country prepared by the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics for the 2011 population census 
of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh. An EA is a geographic area covering on average 113 households. 
The sampling frame contains information about the EA location, type of residence (urban or rural), and the 
estimated number of residential households. A sketch map that delineates the EA geographic boundaries is 
available for each EA. 
Administratively, Bangladesh is divided into seven divisions. Each division is further sub-divided 
into progressively smaller zilas, thanas, unions, wards, and villages. An EA is either a village, or a group of 
small villages, or a part of a large village. These divisions allow the country as a whole to be easily separated 
into small geographical area units with an urban-rural designation. The urban areas were further classified 
into two groups: city corporations and other than city corporations. Table A.1 gives the percentage 
distribution of households by division and by type of residence. The division size varies from 5.6 percent 
(Sylhet, the smallest) to 33.7 percent (Dhaka, the largest). In Bangladesh, 23.3 percent of the households are 
in urban areas; 8.2 percent are in city corporations, and 15.1 percent are in other than city corporations.

SAMPLE DESIGN 
The 2014 BDHS sample was stratified and selected in two stages. Each division was stratified into 
urban and rural areas. Except for Rangpur, the urban areas of each division are further stratified into two 
strata: city corporations and other than city corporations, yielding a total of 20 sampling strata. Urban areas 
in Rangpur are considered in a separate stratum, since the City Corporation areas are not identifiable in the 
census frame. Samples of EAs were selected independently in each stratum in two stages. Implicit 
stratification and proportional allocation were achieved at each of the lower administrative levels by sorting 
the sampling frame within each sampling stratum before sample selection, according to administrative units 
in different levels, and by using a probability proportional to size selection at the first stage of sampling. 
In the first stage, 600 EAs were selected with probability proportional to the EA size and with 
independent selection in each sampling stratum with the sample allocation given in Table A.2. A household 
listing operation will be carried out in all the selected EAs, and the resulting lists of households will be 
served as sampling frame for the selection of households in the second stage. Some of the selected EAs may 
be of large size. In order to minimize the task of household listing, for the selected EAs which have more 
than 200 households, each large EA will be segmented. Only one segment will be selected for the survey 
with probability proportional to the segment size. Household listing will be conducted only in the selected 
segment (see detailed instructions for segmentation in the Manual for Household Listing). So a 2014 BDHS 
cluster is either an EA or a segment of an EA. 
In the second stage of selection, a fixed number of 30 households per cluster will be selected with 
an equal probability systematic selection from the newly created household listing. The survey interviewer 
must interview only the pre-selected households. No replacements and no changes of the pre-selected 
households will be allowed in the implementing stages in order to prevent bias. All ever-married women 
aged 15-49 who are usual members of the selected households or who spent the night before the survey in 
the selected households are eligible for the female survey. 
Table A.3 shows the allocation of households according to division and urban-rural areas, and Table 
A.4 shows the expected number of completed women interviews according to division and urban-rural areas. 
To ensure that the survey precision is comparable across divisions, the sample allocation figures a power 
allocation between divisions and between different types of residence within each division. Based on a fixed 
sample take of 30 households per cluster, the survey selected 600 EAs, 207 in urban areas and 393 in rural 
areas. The survey will be conducted in 18,000 residential households, 6,210 in urban areas and 11,790 in 
rural areas. The sample is expected to result in about 17,886 completed interviews with ever-married women 
age 15-49, 6,150 in urban areas and 11,736 in rural areas.

The sample allocations were derived using information obtained from the 2011 BDHS. Based on 
the 2011 data, the average number of ever-married women age 15-49 per household is 1.05 in urban areas 
and 1.03 in rural areas. The household response rate is 97.2 percent in urban areas and 98.2 percent in rural 
areas, and women individual response rate is 97 percent in urban areas and 98.4 percent in rural areas. 
Results of the household sample implementation by urban-rural residence and by division is shown 
in Tables A.5. Table A.5 shows that 17,989 household were selected for the 2014 BDHS. Of these, 96 percent 
were successfully interviewed; 2 percent were not interviewed because the households were vacant, and 1 
percent because there was no competent respondent in the household during the survey fieldworkers’ visit, 
The household response rate is higher in rural than in urban area. The rate varies by division, ranging from 
99 percent in Rangpur to 97 percent in Dhaka. 
 
 216  •  Appendix A 
Of 18,245 women eligible for individual interview, 98 percent were successfully interviewed and 2 
percent were not interviewed because they were not at home. Urban women were as likely as rural women 
to be interviewed in the survey. The response rates varies little by division.

SAMPLING WEIGHT 
Due to the non-proportional allocation of sample to different divisions and to their urban and rural 
areas and the possible differences in response rates, sampling weight will be required for any analysis using 
the 2014 BDHS data to ensure the actual representative of the survey results at national level and as well as 
at domain level. Since the 2014 BDHS sample is a two-stage stratified cluster sample, sampling weight will 
be calculated based on sampling probabilities separately for each sampling stage and for each cluster. We 
use the following notations: 
P1hi: 
first-stage sampling probability of the ith cluster in stratum h 
P2hi: 
second -stage sampling probability within the ith cluster (households) 
Let ah be the number of EAs selected in stratum h, Mhi the number of households according to the sampling 
frame in the ith EA, and 
M
 
hi

 the total number of households in the stratum. The probability of selecting 
the ith EA in the 2014 BDHS sample is calculated as follows:

A spreadsheet containing all sampling parameters and selection probabilities will be prepared to 
facilitate the calculation of the design weight. Design weight will be adjusted for household non-response 
and as well as for individual non-response to get the sampling weights for households, for women and men 
surveys respectively. The differences of the household sampling weight and the individual sampling weights 
are introduced by individual non-response. The final sampling weights will be normalized in order to give 
the total number of un-weighted cases equal to the total number of weighted cases at national level, for both 
household weight and individual weight, respectively. The normalized weights are relative weights which 
are valid for estimating means, proportions and ratios, but not valid for estimating population totals and for 
pooled data.

ESTIMATES OF SAMPLING ERRORS 
Appendix B
 
he estimates from a sample survey are affected by two types of errors: non-sampling errors and 
sampling errors. Non-sampling errors are the results of mistakes made in implementing data 
collection and data processing, such as failure to locate and interview the correct household, 
misunderstanding of the questions on the part of either the interviewer or the respondent, and data entry 
errors. Although numerous efforts were made during the implementation of the 2014 Bangladesh DHS 
(BDHS) to minimize this type of error, non-sampling errors are impossible to avoid and difficult to evaluate 
statistically. 
Sampling errors, on the other hand, can be evaluated statistically. The sample of respondents 
selected in the 2014 BDHS is only one of many samples that could have been selected from the same 
population, using the same design and expected size. Each of these samples would yield results that differ 
somewhat from the results of the actual sample selected. Sampling errors are a measure of the variability 
between all possible samples. Although the degree of variability is not known exactly, it can be estimated 
from the survey results. 
Sampling error is usually measured in terms of the standard error for a particular statistic (mean, 
percentage, etc.), which is the square root of the variance. The standard error can be used to calculate 
confidence intervals within which the true value for the population can reasonably be assumed to fall. For 
example, for any given statistic calculated from a sample survey, the value of that statistic will fall within a 
range of plus or minus two times the standard error of that statistic in 95 percent of all possible samples of 
identical size and design. 
If the sample of respondents had been selected as a simple random sample, it would have been 
possible to use straightforward formulas for calculating sampling errors. However, the 2014 BDHS sample 
is the result of a multi-stage stratified design, and, consequently, it was necessary to use more complex 
formulae. Sampling errors are computed in either ISSA or SAS, using programs developed by ICF 
International. These programs use the Taylor linearization method of variance estimation for survey 
estimates that are means, proportions or ratios. The Jackknife repeated replication method is used for 
variance estimation of more complex statistics such as fertility and mortality rates. 
The Taylor linearization method treats any percentage or average as a ratio estimate, r = y x , 
where y represents the total sample value for variable y, and x represents the total number of cases in the 
group or subgroup under consideration. The variance of r is computed using the formula given below, with 
the standard error being the square root of the variance:

The Jackknife repeated replication method derives estimates of complex rates from each of several 
replications of the parent sample and calculates standard errors for these estimates using simple formula. 
Each replication considers all but one cluster in the calculation of the estimates. Pseudo-independent 
replications are thus created. In the 2014 BDHS, there were 600 non-empty clusters. Hence, 600 replications 
were created. The variance of a rate r is calculated as follows:

is the estimate computed from the reduced sample of 599 clusters (ith cluster excluded), and 
k 
is the total number of clusters. 
In addition to the standard error, the design effect (DEFT) for each estimate is also calculated. The 
design effect is defined as the ratio between the standard error using the given sample design and the standard 
error that would result if a simple random sample had been used. A DEFT value of 1.0 indicates that the 
sample design is as efficient as a simple random sample, while a value greater than 1.0 indicates the increase 
in the sampling error due to the use of a more complex and less statistically efficient design. Relative standard 
errors and confidence limits for the estimates are also calculated. 
Sampling errors for the 2014 BDHS are calculated for selected variables considered to be of primary 
interest. The results are presented in this appendix for the country as a whole, for urban and rural areas, and 
for each of the seven divisions. For each variable, the type of statistic (mean, proportion, or rate) and the 
base population are given in Table B.1. Tables B.2 through B.11 present the value of the statistic (R), its 
standard error (SE), the number of un-weighted (N) and weighted (WN) cases, the design effect (DEFT), the 
relative standard error (SE/R), and the 95 percent confidence limits (R±2SE), for each selected variable. The 
DEFT is considered undefined when the standard error considering a simple random sample is zero (when 
the estimate is close to 0 or 1). 
The confidence interval (e.g., as calculated for the number of children ever born for women 40-49 
years) can be interpreted as follows: the overall average from the national sample is 3.886 and its standard 
error is 0.048. Therefore, to obtain the 95 percent confidence limits, one adds and subtracts twice the standard 
error to the sample estimate, that is 3.886 ± 2×0.048. There is a high probability (95 percent) that the true 
proportion of women 40-49 with children ever born is between 3.790 and 3.982. 
For the total sample, the value of the DEFT, averaged over all variables, is 1.776. This means that, 
due to multi-stage clustering of the sample, the average standard error is increased by a factor of 1.776 over 
that in an equivalent simple random sample.

Hello.  My name is _______________________________________. I am working with NIPORT, the Ministry of Health and 
Family Welfare, and Mitra and Associates,  a private research organization located in Dhaka. We are conducting a survey 
about health all over Bangladesh. The information we collect will help the government to plan health services. Your 
household was selected for the survey. I would like to ask you some questions about your household. The questions usually 
take about 15 to 20 minutes. All of the answers you give will be confidential and will not be shared with anyone other than 
members of our survey team. You don't have to be in the survey, but we hope you will agree to answer the questions since 
your views are important. If I ask you any question you don't want to answer, just let me know and I will go on to the next 
question or you can stop the interview at any time. 
In case you need more information about the survey, you may contact with Mr. S. N Mitra, Executive Director, Mitra and 
Associates, 2/17 Iqbal Road, Block A, Mohammadpur, Dhaka 1207, Bangladesh. Telephone number are: 8118065,9115503, 
01711278663.
