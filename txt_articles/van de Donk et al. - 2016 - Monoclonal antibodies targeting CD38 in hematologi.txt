Summary: CD38 is a multifunctional cell surface protein that has
receptor as well as enzyme functions. The protein is generally
expressed at low levels on various hematological and solid tissues,
while plasma cells express particularly high levels of CD38. The protein
is also expressed in a subset of hematological tumors, and shows espe-
cially broad and high expression levels in plasma cell tumors such as
multiple myeloma (MM). Together, this triggered the development of
various therapeutic CD38 antibodies, including daratumumab, isatux-
imab, and MOR202. Daratumumab binds a unique CD38 epitope and
showed strong anti-tumor activity in preclinical models. The antibody
engages diverse mechanisms of action, including complement-depen-
dent cytotoxicity, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, antibody-
dependent cellular phagocytosis, programmed cell death, modulation
of enzymatic activity, and immunomodulatory activity. CD38-targeting
antibodies have a favorable toxicity profile in patients, and early clinical
data show a marked activity in MM, while studies in other hematologi-
cal malignancies are ongoing. Daratumumab has single agent activity
and a limited toxicity profile, allowing favorable combination therapies
with existing as well as emerging therapies, which are currently evalu-
ated in the clinic. Finally, CD38 antibodies may have a role in the
treatment of diseases beyond hematological malignancies, including
solid tumors and antibody-mediated autoimmune diseases.

in a project investigating cell surface molecules of human
leukocytes

differentiation and activation marker of lymphocytes, later
it was used as a phenotypic marker in the classification of

 T- and B-cell malignancies, and identified as a promising
target for antibody-based therapies. It was also found that
CD38 has multiple receptor and enzymatic functions. Here,
we bring all these aspects of CD38 together, and give our
perspective on CD38-targeted therapy.
The CD38 gene
The human CD38 gene is located on chromosome 4 (4p15)
and stretches over 62 kb. The gene comprises seven introns,
which represent the vast majority (>98%) of the gene, and
eight exons that encode the CD38 protein (2). Gene transcrip-
tion is regulated at multiple levels. The promoter region is
characterized by the presence of CpG islands that are con-
trolled by methylation, but lacks canonical TATA and CAAT
boxes (3). Potential binding sites for various immunological
transcription factors, including those for T cell-specific
transcription factor alpha (TCF-1a), nuclear factor-IL-6 (NF-
IL-6), and interferon responsive factor-1 (IRF-1) are located
upstream of these CpG islands (3). Tumor necrosis factor-
alpha (TNFa), for example, has been shown to mediate inter-
feron-dependent induction of CD38 expression in airway
smooth muscle cells (4), and IFNc upregulates expression
and activity of CD38 in human monocytes (5). Another level
of transcriptional control is positioned within intron 1, which
contains responsive elements for retinoic acid (RA) (6) and
peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor c (PPARc) (7).
Interestingly, in vivo upregulation of CD38 via the RA receptor
signaling pathway was observed in patients with promyelo-
cytic leukemia following a single oral administration of RA
(6, 8, 9). Finally, the transcription factor E2A mediates CD38
gene transcription in response to environmental signals, such
as interleukin-2 and TLR-9 ligands (10). Transcription initia-
tion by E2A is affected by the presence of a single nucleotide
polymorphism (SNP) at the 50-end of intron 1, which is
located within a putative E-box (10–12). The presence of a
guanine (G) instead of a cytosine (C) at this position, which
is present in approximately 14% of the healthy Caucasian
population, enhances CD38 transcription and results in
increased protein expression levels (10, 11). Of note, the fre-
quency of this relatively rare G allele was significantly higher
in a subset of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients
with markers of poor prognosis (10).
CD38 protein structure
The human CD38 antigen is a 46-kDa type II transmem-
brane glycoprotein. The primary and secondary structure of
CD38 exhibits a striking similarity (approximately 35%
amino acid identity) to a soluble cyclase that was identified
from the mollusk Aplysia californica (13, 14). CD38 contains a
relatively long C-terminal extracellular domain (258 aa), a
transmembrane region (21 aa) and a short N-terminal cyto-
plasmic tail (21 aa) (15). The protein is stabilized by six
disulfide bonds and has four potential N-linked glycosyla-
tion sites. The crystal structure of the CD38 extracellular
domain has been resolved to 1.9 �
A, revealing that the pro-
tein’s overall topology is similar to the related proteins
CD157 and the Aplysia ADP-ribosyl cyclase, except for large
structural differences at the two termini (16). Further bio-
chemical observations indicated the existence of a CD38 tet-
ramer on the cell surface (17–19). Tetramerization was
suggested to be required for the CD38 catalytic activity and
the localization of CD38 in lipid rafts (20). In addition to
the cell membrane-bound form, a 39-kDa soluble variant of
CD38 has been found in biological fluids (21), and a 78-
kDa soluble form was identified from cells of X-linked
agammaglobulinemia patients (19).
CD38: the receptor
Early functional studies showed that CD38 regulates weak
adhesion events that take place between circulating lympho-
cytes and endothelial cells (22). This finding was key in
identifying a receptor function for CD38. A murine mAb
raised against HUVEC blocked CD38-mediated adhesion of
several cell lines to HUVEC (23). By resolving the target of
this blocking mAb, CD31 was identified as a ligand for
CD38 (24). CD31 (also known as PECAM-1) is a member
of the Ig gene superfamily characterized by six Ig-like
domains (25). In addition to its expression on endothelial
cells, CD31 is expressed on lymphoid cells (follicle mantle B
cells and plasma cells), in the lungs (alveolar ducts, alveoli,

 and lymphatic vessels), and in the kidney (glomerular cells)
(26). The CD38–CD31 interaction does not only play a role
in the binding and migration of leukocytes through the
endothelial cell wall but also triggers activation and prolifer-
ation of human leukocytes (24, 27). Moreover, the adhesion
function of CD38 is involved in the differentiation of B
cells, which requires heterotypic interactions as a crucial
developmental step.
CD38: the ecto-enzyme
Next to its receptor function, CD38 has bifunctional ecto-
enzymatic activity (28, 29). The protein has cyclase as well
as hydrolase activity. Similar to its Aplysia homolog, CD38
uses NAD+ as substrate for the formation of cyclic ADP-
ribose (cADPR) and ADPR. Indeed, studies in CD38 knock-
out mice showed that CD38 is indispensable for NAD+-gly-
cohydrolase activity in the liver and brain (30). In acidic
conditions, CD38 in addition catalyzes the generation of
nicotinic acid-adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP+)
from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP+)
(29, 31, 32). cADPR, ADPR, and NAADP+ are potent second
messengers that regulate Ca2+ mobilization from the cytosol
(33), activating signaling pathways that control various bio-
logical processes, such as lymphocyte proliferation (34) and
insulin secretion by b-cells in the pancreas (35–37). Inter-
estingly, recent studies suggest a pivotal role of CD38-
dependent adenosine production in immune suppression
mediated by natural killer (NK) cells (38) and an involve-
ment
of
CD38
in
immune
modulation
mediated
by
myeloid-derived suppressor cells (39).
CD38 tissue distribution
CD38 is expressed on lymphoid and myeloid cells as well as
in a several non-hematopoetic tissues (40).
Expression of CD38 in hematopoietic cells depends on
the differentiation and activation status of the cell. Lineage-
committed hematopoietic cells express the protein, while it
is lost by mature cells and expressed again on activated lym-
phocytes. For example, the majority of medullary thymo-
cytes show expression of CD38, circulating T cells do not
express CD38, while expression is induced in activated T
cells. CD38 is also expressed on B cells, whereby plasma
cells express particularly high levels of CD38. Approximately
80% of resting NK cells and monocytes express CD38 at
lower levels, as do various other hematological cell types,
including
lymph
node
germinal
center
lymphoblasts,
intrafollicular cells (15), dendritic cells, erythrocytes (41,
42), and platelets (15, 41, 43–45). Although CD38 is
widely expressed on cells of hematopoietic origin, including
committed
stem
cells,
the
hematopoietic
compartment
remained unaltered in CD38 knockout mice (30), suggest-
ing
that
CD38
is
not
critical
to
hematopoiesis
or
lymphopoiesis in mice.
With
regard
to
non-hematopoietic
tissues,
CD38
is
expressed at low levels in some specific cell types, such as
Purkinje cells and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain,
epithelial cells in the prostate, b-cells in the pancreas, osteo-
clasts in the bone, retinal cells in the eye, and sarcolemma
of smooth and striated muscle (40).
Expression of CD38 in disease
Expression of CD38 has been associated with a number of
diseases, including HIV infection (46, 47), autoimmune dis-
eases [e.g. systemic lupus erythematosus (48)], type II dia-
betes mellitus (35), osteoporosis (49), and cancer. Most
notably, CD38 is expressed in a large number of hematolog-
ical malignancies. Expression has been observed particularly
in the malignant cells of multiple myeloma (MM) (50) and
CLL
(51),
and
was
also
reported
in
Waldenstr€
om’s
macroglobulinemia
(52),
primary
systemic
amyloidosis
(53), mantle cell lymphoma (54), acute lymphoblastic leu-
kemia (55), acute myeloid leukemia (55, 56), NK cell leu-
kemia (57), NK/T-cell lymphoma (58), and plasma cell
leukemia (59).
Multiple myeloma
MM is a neoplasm of the B-cell lineage that is characterized
by proliferation of plasma cells in the bone marrow. This
typically results in anemia and increased bone resorption by
osteoclasts, frequently leading to bone fractures or hypercal-
cemia. MM is further characterized by the production of
excess immunoglobulin, usually of an IgG class, (M-protein)
or fragments thereof (kappa or lambda free light chains).
Large amounts of free light chains may result in damage to
tubular cells in the kidney, leading to acute renal failure.
Over the last decade, the survival of MM patients has sig-
nificantly improved due to the application of autologous
stem cell transplantation in younger patients and the intro-
duction of novel drugs such as the immunomodulatory
agents (IMiDs) lenalidomide and pomalidomide, and the
proteasome inhibitors (PI) bortezomib and carfilzomib.
However, the far majority of patients still relapse even when
intensive therapy is combined with IMiDs and PIs (60). In
addition, patients who present with high-risk disease as

van de Donk et al � CD38 as a target for antibody therapy
 determined by cytogenetic analysis (especially deletion of
chromosome 17p), gene-expression profiling, or clinical
characteristics such as presence of extramedullary disease or
circulating tumor cells (plasma cell leukemia) benefit less
for the newly available treatments (61). Altogether, this
clearly demonstrates that there is a need for additional active
agents with distinct mechanisms of action, especially for the
relapsed and refractory patients.
Therapeutic antibodies are successfully used in many
hematological cancers, but no appropriate antibodies are
yet available for MM. However, with various candidates in
late-stage clinical development, monoclonal antibodies are
an emerging class of agents for the treatment of MM
(62). Therapeutic antibodies generally show a favorable
tolerability profile with the primary toxicity targeted to
the tumor cell. Depending on the antigen bound, mAbs
engage diverse mechanisms of action that differ from
existing therapies of MM, including IMiDs and proteasome
inhibitors.
CD38 is a highly interesting target for antibody therapy
in MM and related disorders, as virtually all MM cells
express high levels of CD38 on their cell surface, similar to
normal plasma cells (50).
CD38 antibodies
High expression levels in combination with its role in cell
signaling points to CD38 as an attractive therapeutic anti-
body target, in particular for MM and CD38-positive NHL.
Indeed, various CD38 antibodies have been developed and
show strong preclinical and clinical potential.
Most advanced in development is the human anti-CD38
IgG1 daratumumab, which is in late-stage clinical studies
for the treatment of MM in combination with a number of
drugs representing the standard of care. Daratumumab was
originally developed by Genmab (63) and licensed by Jans-
sen Biotech in 2012. In 2013, the Food and Drug Adminis-
tration (FDA) granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation to
daratumumab for the treatment of patients with MM who
have received at least three prior lines of therapy including
a PI and an IMiD, or who are double refractory to a PI and
IMiD. The FDA approved daratumumab (Darzalex) for this
indication on November 16, 2015 under a priority review.
The European Medicines Agency (EMA) also granted a prior-
ity review for the daratumumab Marketing Authorization
Application. Daratumumab received Orphan Drug Designa-
tion from the US FDA and the EMA for the treatment of
MM.
In addition to Janssen Biotech, two other companies,
Morphosys (Munich, Germany) and Sanofi-Aventis (Paris,
France), have CD38-specific antibodies in clinical develop-
ment.
Sanofi
Oncology
has

isatuximab
(SAR650984)
(64),
a

anti-CD38
antibody
[which obtained a chimeric designation under the new
2014 definitions for INN]. Isatuximab is currently being
tested in early clinical trials in CD38-positive hematological
malignancies, including MM (64, 65). Morphosys is devel-
oping the human CD38 antibody MOR202 that is being
investigated as monotherapy and in combination with
lenalidomide/dexamethasone or pomalidomide/dexametha-
sone in a phase I/II study in refractory or relapsed MM.
Furthermore, several CD38-targeting antibodies have been
described that are in preclinical development: Takeda is
developing the human anti-CD38 antibodies Ab79 and
Ab19 (66), Xencor has a CD3/CD38 bispecific antibody
program (67), and Molecular Templates is developing an
anti-CD38 antibody–drug conjugate (MT-4019).
Daratumumab, a human monoclonal antibody with
broad-spectrum anti-tumor activity
Daratumumab binds to a unique epitope
Daratumumab (also referred to as HuMax-CD38 and IgG1-
005) is an immunoglobulin G1 kappa (IgG1j) human
monoclonal antibody (mAb) that specifically binds a unique
epitope present on the CD38 molecule. Specific and strong
binding of daratumumab to CD38 expressed on the cell sur-
face on Daudi cells as well as fresh MM cells was shown
(63). BIAcore analysis confirmed that daratumumab binds
with high affinity to human CD38, with an affinity constant
(KD) of 4.36 nM (Genmab, data on file). Daratumumab was
selected from a panel of 42 CD38-specific mAbs that were
generated with the validated HuMAb technology using
human Ab transgenic mice (68). Daratumumab stood out in
its exceptional ability to mediate complement-dependent
cytotoxicity (CDC) of CD38-overexpressing cell lines as well
as patient-derived MM cells (63). Prophylactic treatment
with daratumumab induced a remarkably high anti-tumor
efficacy in a Daudi tumor model in mice (63). Daratu-
mumab also induced marked anti-tumor activity in a MM
xenograft model in a late treatment setting, in which daratu-
mumab was given 3 weeks after tumor cell inoculation
(63).
Using a constrained peptide approach, the epitope of
daratumumab was mapped to two b-strands containing
amino acids 233–246 and 267–280 of CD38. Following the

van de Donk et al � CD38 as a target for antibody therapy
 observation that daratumumab does not bind to cynomolgus
CD38, CD38 variants incorporating amino acid differences
between human and cynomolgus CD38 were generated.
Using these variants, specific amino acid residues were iden-
tified which are important for daratumumab binding, in
particular serine at position 274 (63). We speculate that the
daratumumab epitope on CD38, as well as the antibody’s
binding orientation, offer a favorable structural arrangement
for hexamer formation, allowing efficient docking of C1q
and initiation of the complement pathway (69).
Daratumumab has a broad-spectrum killing activity. In
addition to CDC, the binding of daratumumab to CD38 on
the surface of tumor cells has been shown to induce
antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), antibody-
dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP), tumor cell apopto-
sis, and modulation of the enzymatic activity CD38 (Fig. 1).
Complement-dependent cytotoxicity
Complement activation is an extremely potent mechanism of
action that is highly epitope dependent and therefore only
deployed by a small fraction of antibodies ((70) and refer-
ences therein). Complement activation induces the generation
of opsonins, chemoattractants, anaphylatoxins, and mem-
brane attack complexes (71, 72). As mentioned, daratu-
mumab was selected from a panel of CD38 antibodies based
on its superior CDC activity in vitro. The ability of daratu-
mumab to induce CDC was further demonstrated in vitro in
various tumor cells and cell lines in the presence of comple-
ment-containing human serum. Daratumumab was also found
to induce streamers, which is indicative for induction of CDC
(73). Significantly, daratumumab induced killing of freshly
isolated MM cells obtained from the bone marrow of previ-
ously untreated or refractory MM patients (63). In CDC assays
with bone marrow samples from MM patients, a marked
heterogeneity in susceptibility of the MM cells to daratu-
mumab was observed, which could not be explained by the
extent of previous therapy (74). These differences may be
explained by variation in expression levels of CD38 (74).
Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity
Observations that clinical response after therapeutic antibody
treatment correlated with FccRIIIa polymorphisms (75, 76)
indicated that Fc-receptor-dependent mechanisms substan-
tially contribute to the cytotoxic action of therapeutic anti-
bodies against tumors.
In preclinical studies, we have shown that daratumumab
triggers Fc-receptor-mediated tumor cell killing, including
ADCC (63). In in vitro assays using PBMCs from healthy
donors as effector cells, it was shown that daratumumab
mediated dose-dependent ADCC against Daudi cells and a
panel of drug-sensitive and drug-resistant MM cell lines,
whether or not in the presence of bone marrow stem cells

van de Donk et al � CD38 as a target for antibody therapy
 (63). No cytotoxicity was observed in CD38-negative cells
treated with daratumumab, confirming that induction of
ADCC depends on target expression. Daratumumab induced
ADCC against patient-derived MM cells, whereby maximal
killing differed per tumor sample and depended partly on the
frequency of effector cells (63, 69). Importantly, daratu-
mumab also induced effective lysis in a subset of patient-
derived MM cells with autologous effector cells, which was
enhanced when combined with lenalidomide (63, 77). In
bone marrow samples from MM patients, no difference in
daratumumab-mediated ADCC was observed between newly
diagnosed or relapsed or refractory patients (69). The hetero-
geneity in responsiveness of primary MM cells toward daratu-
mumab was associated with CD38 expression (69).
Antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis
ADCP of IgG1-opsonized cancer cells occurs via binding to
FccRs, in particular via the low-affinity FccRIIa and FccRIIIa
(78). Macrophages are specialized phagocytes and are an
abundant
component
of
the
tumor
microenvironment,
including of MM (79, 80). In co-cultures of macrophages
and various MM and Burkitt’s lymphoma-derived tumor cell
lines,
daratumumab
efficiently
induced
macrophage-
mediated phagocytosis, as observed in an in vitro flow
cytometry assay (81). Interestingly, in live cell imaging
studies,
it
was
observed
that
individual
macrophages
sequentially engulfed multiple tumor cells within a relatively
short time span (81). Furthermore, in in vivo subcutaneous
and intravenous leukemic xenograft mouse models, daratu-
mumab induced significantly stronger anti-tumor activity
compared to a matched IgG2 isotype equivalent incapable of
inducing phagocytosis by mouse macrophages. This indi-
cates that phagocytosis contributes to the mechanism of
action of daratumumab in vivo. Importantly, daratumumab-
dependent phagocytosis was demonstrated ex vivo in 11 of
12 patient-derived MM cell isolates with variable levels of
CD38 expression (81), suggesting that phagocytosis is a
clinically relevant mechanism of action that may contribute
to the therapeutic activity of daratumumab.
Apoptosis
Emerging evidence indicates that FccR-mediated cross-link-
ing of tumor-bound monoclonal antibodies may induce
programmed cell death (PCD) in tumor cells (82–85).
Indeed, in a model system in which cross-linking of daratu-
mumab is induced with an anti-Fc antibody or by cells
expressing FccRI was found to kill CD38-positive MM
tumor cell lines in vitro via programmed cell death (PCD)
(M.B. Overdijk, J.H.M. Jansen, M. Nederend, J.J. Lammerts
van Bueren, R.W.J. Groen, P.W.H.I. Parren, J.H.W. Leusen,
P. Boross, submitted).
Furthermore, mouse studies indicated that FccR-mediated
cross-linking of daratumumab also contributes to PCD
induction in vivo. Studies in FccR-chain knockout (FccR�/�)
mice showed that expression of the inhibitory mouse
FccRIIb was sufficient to induce PCD in vivo, albeit at rela-
tively low levels. Daratumumab also induced PCD of CD38-
expressing tumor cells in the NOTAM mouse model (M.B.
Overdijk, J.H.M. Jansen, M. Nederend , J.J. Lammerts van
Bueren, R.W.J. Groen, P.W.H.I. Parren, J.H.W. Leusen, P.
Boross, submitted), which have normal surface expression
of all activating murine FccRs, but lack signaling capacity.
This indicates that activating FccRs can also mediate cross-
linking of daratumumab resulting in induction of PCD.
Taken together, in vitro and in vivo data indicate that FccR-
mediated cross-linking of daratumumab results in PCD of
CD38 expressing MM tumor cells. The underlying cellular
mechanism and the contribution to the overall anti-tumor
effect in vivo still need to be elucidated.
Anti-tumor activity of daratumumab in bone marrow
mononuclear cells ex vivo
To evaluate the cytotoxic effect of daratumumab in a more
physiological system, assays were performed with bone
marrow mononuclear cells from MM patients. In these
assays, effector cells, tumor-supporting stromal cells, and 2–
50% malignant plasma cells were present. In this ex vivo
setup, daratumumab induced substantial tumor cell lysis,
which was significantly increased when it was combined
with emerging anti-myeloma drugs and drug combinations,
including lenalidomide and bortezomib (77, 86). Various
mechanisms may contribute to the cytotoxic effect of dara-
tumumab in this setup, including induction of PCD and in
particular ADCC. Of interest, addition of complement in this
assay even further enhanced daratumumab-mediated killing
of myeloma cells by induction of CDC (77).
Enzymatic modulation
As described above, CD38 has enzymatic activity and possesses
both cyclase and hydrolase activities. In experiments using
recombinant CD38 protein or CD38-expressing cells, we
observed that daratumumab inhibits the cyclase activity of
CD38 in vitro (Fig. 2A, B). Furthermore, daratumumab was
found to stimulate the activity of CD38 to hydrolyze cADPR

van de Donk et al � CD38 as a target for antibody therapy
 in vitro (unpublished data). Thus, daratumumab modulates the
enzymatic activities of CD38, blunting cyclase activity, and
enhancing hydrolase activity. Overall this will result in
increased levels of NAD and ADPR and decreased cADPR con-
centrations (Fig. 2C). Reduction in cADPR levels may lead to
decreased Ca2+ mobilization and reduced signaling. Further-
more, increased NAD levels may induce cell death, although
as an added complexity it should be noted that altered NAD
homeostasis has multifaceted effects on cellular survival
depending on cellular context (87). It has been postulated that
the metabolic activity of CD38 contributes to a microenviron-
ment that is favorable for tumor survival in closed environ-
mental systems, such as the bone marrow niche (88).
Interestingly, the CD38 enzymatic activity may also contribute
to immune suppression observed in myeloma patients (88).
The complex role of CD38 in calcium signaling and NAD
metabolism thus complicates pinpointing the exact conse-
quences of enzymatic modulation of CD38 by daratumumab.
Conclusion
Thus, daratumumab is a CD38-specific antibody that showed
strong anti-tumor activity in tumor models in vivo and
engages multiple mechanisms of action. The antibody has a
unique binding profile and effectively triggers Fc-dependent
effector functions, including CDC, ADCC, and ADCP, while
Fc cross-linking induces PCD of daratumumab-opsonized
cells. Furthermore, daratumumab modulates the enzymatic
activities of CD38, blunting the cyclase activity, and enhanc-
ing the hydrolase activity. While all of these actions are
involved in the anti-tumor activity mediated by daratu-
mumab, the exact contribution of each mechanism to the
observed clinical activity needs to be elucidated.
Preclinical rationale for daratumumab-based
combination therapies in multiple myeloma
Combinations of therapeutic agents are often superior in terms
of depth of response and survival, when compared to treat-
ment with a single agent. Combination therapies simultane-
ously target multiple pathologic pathways and prevent escape
and resistance mechanisms of tumor cells. This also applies for
combinations of pharmacological agents with therapeutic
monoclonal antibodies, which often result in superior effects
compared to monotherapy. Indeed, the combination of mono-

 conventional drugs that have synergistic mechanisms of
action and non-overlapping toxicities. Also modulation of
determinants of sensitivity of the tumor cell toward CD38-
targeting antibodies with novel therapeutic approaches may
lead to more effective regimens with increased quality of
response and improvement in survival.
Immunomodulatory agents
Lenalidomide is an amino-substituted derivative of thalido-
mide with direct anti-proliferative and cytotoxic effects on the
myeloma tumor cell, as well as anti-angiogenic activity and
potent immunomodulatory effects (90). Lenalidomide has
remarkable activity in patients with newly diagnosed MM (91)
and relapsed refractory MM (92, 93) and it has contributed to
significantly improved survival of myeloma patients (94).
Because
of the strong immunostimulating effects
of
lenalidomide including activation of NK cells (important
effector cells in ADCC), we have evaluated the activity of
lenalidomide combined with CD38-targeting antibodies in
diverse
preclinical
models.
Lenalidomide
significantly
enhanced daratumumab-mediated killing of MM cell lines
and primary MM cells by activating the effector cells of
ADCC (77). Indeed, pretreatment of effector cells with
lenalidomide significantly improved their ability to kill MM
cells in ADCC assays (77). Daratumumab-mediated ADCC
was also significantly upregulated when peripheral blood
mononuclear cells were used from lenalidomide-treated
patients (77), whereas daratumumab-mediated CDC, in con-
trast, was not affected by lenalidomide (77). Importantly,
the combination of daratumumab and lenalidomide also sig-
nificantly improved ADCC against MM cells derived from
lenalidomide-refractory patients (95). Finally, lenalidomide
synergized with daratumumab in killing primary MM cells
from a lenalidomide-refractory patient in a humanized
mouse model (95). This indicates that despite resistance of
the tumor cells to lenalidomide, the patients’ immune sys-
tem may still be able to respond to the immunomodulatory
effects of lenalidomide. Similarly, the activity of isatuximab
and MOR202 is synergistically enhanced by lenalidomide
(96, 97). The activity of daratumumab or the combination
of daratumumab with lenalidomide was further augmented
by IPH2102, which improves NK cell activity by blocking
the three main inhibitory KIR receptors (KIR2DL1/2/3)
present on the cell surface of NK cells (98).
Pomalidomide is a next-generation oral immunomodulatory
agent, which has potent direct anti-myeloma activity, inhibits
stromal cell support, and appears to have stronger immune
modulatory effects compared to lenalidomide (99, 100).
Pomalidomide
is
active
in
relapsed/refractory
myeloma
patients who have received multiple lines of therapy. Impor-
tantly, pomalidomide plus low-dose dexamethasone has also
shown activity in patients with lenalidomide and bortezomib-
refractory disease with at least partial response (PR) in approx-
imately 25–30% (101–103). In vitro, isatuximab-mediated
ADCC against MM cells was enhanced more potently by
pomalidomide, when compared to lenalidomide (96, 104).
Pomalidomide was also more effective than lenalidomide in
enhancing isatuximab-induced apoptosis (96).
Proteasome inhibitors
Bortezomib is a potent reversible proteasome inhibitor with
high anti-MM activity. Bortezomib induces clinically signifi-
cant responses with acceptable toxicity in newly diagnosed
and in relapsed/refractory myeloma (105, 106). Together
with the introduction of the immunomodulatory drugs,
bortezomib
has
significantly
improved
the
survival
of
patients with relapsed and refractory myeloma (94).
The combination of daratumumab and bortezomib resulted
in additive effects in ADCC assays in our in vitro assay setup
using bone marrow samples from MM patients (95). Syner-
gistic anti-tumor activity was also demonstrated between isat-
uximab and bortezomib in a myeloma mouse model (107).
All-trans retinoic acid
We have shown that the level of cell surface expression of
CD38 on MM cells was positively associated with extent of
ADCC as well as CDC (69). Interaction of all-trans retinoic acid
(ATRA) with nuclear retinoic acid receptors results in induction
of CD38 expression (69, 108, 109), which significantly
improved daratumumab-mediated ADCC and CDC against MM
cells (69). ATRA enhanced CDC to a larger extent than ADCC,
which may be explained by concomitant downregulation of
complement-inhibitory proteins CD55 and CD59 (69). Inter-
estingly, ATRA significantly improved the anti-MM effect of
daratumumab in a humanized mouse model in vivo (69).
Standard-of-care regimens
The
three-drug
regimens
MPV
(melphalan–prednisone–
bortezomib) (110) and RVD (lenalidomide–bortezomib–
dexamethasone) (111) are widely used in the treatment of
MM patients. However, patients eventually develop resis-
tance to these three-drug regimens. In preclinical studies,
daratumumab
improved
the
anti-myeloma
effect
of
both RVD and MPV (86). This indicates that addition of

 daratumumab to these important treatment regimens holds a
significant potential to improve the clinical outcome of MM
patients.
Clinical studies in multiple myeloma
Preclinical studies by us and others provided a strong ratio-
nale of evaluating a CD38-targeting antibody alone or in
combination in MM patients with relapsed/refractory or
newly diagnosed disease (Tables 1–3).
Daratumumab in relapsed/refractory MM
Based on the preclinical activity of daratumumab, a phase 1/2
study was initiated in MM patients with relapsed/refractory
disease (GEN501 study) (112). In the first-in-human dose-

 escalation part of the study, the maximum-tolerated dose was
not reached with dose levels up to 24 mg/kg. In the phase 2
part of the study, patients with a median of 4 prior lines of
therapy (majority refractory to lenalidomide and bortezomib)
were treated with daratumumab at a dose of 8 mg/kg or
16 mg/kg. The overall response rate (at least PR) was 36% in
the 16 mg/kg cohort and 10% in the 8 mg/kg group.
Remarkably, in this extensively pretreated group of patients, 2
of 42 patients treated with 16 mg/kg daratumumab achieved
a first complete response. The median PFS in the 8 mg/kg
and 16 mg/kg groups were 2.4 and 5.6 months, respectively.
The 12-month survival was 77% for both groups. The most
frequent adverse events were infusion-related reactions,
which occurred in 71% of patients. The majority of these
reactions included grade 1 and 2, and characterized by rhini-
tis, cough, headache, pyrexia, and dyspnea. The most infu-
sion-related reactions occurred during the first daratumumab
infusion and only few patients (<10%) had infusion-related
reactions with more than one infusion.
The SIRIUS (MMY2002) study confirmed the results from
GEN501 study that demonstrated single agent activity of dara-
tumumab with a favorable toxicity profile (113). One hun-
dred and six patients, with a median of 5 prior lines of
therapy (95% refractory to lenalidomide and bortezomib),
received daratumumab monotherapy at a dose of 16 mg/kg.
At least a PR was achieved in 29% of patients with stringent
complete response (CR) in 3%. The median duration of
response was 7.4 months. The median progression-free sur-
vival was 3.7 months and 1-year overall survival was 65%.
Notably, subgroup analysis showed that in the group of
patients who were refractory to lenalidomide, pomalidomide,
bortezomib, and carfilzomib, PR or better was achieved in
21%
of
these
patients.
Infusion-related
reactions
were
observed in 43% of the patients and were predominantly
grade 1 and 2, and could be managed with interruption of
the infusion or extra corticosteroids and anti-histamines.
The
preclinical
evidence
showing
that
lenalidomide
enhances daratumumab-mediated anti-MM activity formed
the rationale for an ongoing phase 1/2 study of daratu-
mumab and lenalidomide plus dexamethasone (GEN503) in
relapsed/refractory myeloma. Preliminary results showed
high response rates (at least VGPR in 60% of patients treated
with ≥4 cycles in part 2) that improved over time (114).
Based on these results, a phase 3 randomized study is com-
paring lenalidomide–dexamethasone with or without daratu-
mumab in the relapsed/refractory setting (POLLUX study;
enrollment completed). Also the combination of daratu-
mumab with pomalidomide and dexamethasone is evaluated
in relapsed/refractory patients and preliminary results are
promising with encouraging activity and little additional
toxicity, other than infusion-related reactions (115).
The combination of daratumumab with bortezomib is
evaluated in the relapsed/refractory setting in the ongoing,
randomized phase 3 CASTOR study, which compares borte-

 zomib–dexamethasone with or without daratumumab in
MM patients with at least one prior line of therapy (enroll-
ment completed September 2015). A phase 1b study is also
evaluating the safety of daratumumab in combination with
carfilzomib
and
dexamethasone
in
relapsed/refractory
patients.
Isatuximab in relapsed/refractory MM
A first-in-human, phase 1 dose-escalation study, evaluated
single agent isatuximab in 34 patients with relapsed/refrac-
tory CD38-positive malignancies (116, 117). The maxi-
mum-tolerated dose was not reached with dosing up to
20 mg/kg. The majority of the patients in this trial had
MM, and patients were heavily pretreated with a median of
6 prior regimens. In the group of MM patients treated with
isatuximab at a dose of ≥10 mg/kg (n = 18), PR or better
was observed in 33% including CR in 11%. With preinfu-
sion prophylaxis consisting of corticosteroids, anti-hista-
mines,
and
acetaminophen,
infusion-related
reactions
occurred in 39% of the patients who were treated with isat-
uximab at a dose of ≥3 mg/kg. All infusion-related reac-
tions
occurred
during
the
first
infusion
and
were
predominantly grade 1 or 2. Symptoms of infusion-related
reactions
included
nausea,
pyrexia,
vomiting,
dyspnea,
cough, and nasal congestion.
Based on the observed single agent activity of isatuximab
and preclinical evidence of synergy between isatuximab and
lenalidomide, the combination of isatuximab and lenalido-
mide–dexamethasone is currently evaluated in a phase 1
clinical study with relapsed/refractory MM patients (116).
Preliminary results show that the combination is effective
and has a favorable toxicity profile (116). Interestingly,
response
was
also
achieved
in
lenalidomide-refractory
patients (PR or better: 48%), which suggests that the
immune system of these patients could still respond to the
immunomodulatory effects of lenalidomide (116). Infusion-
related reactions were observed in 39% of the patients, pre-
dominantly during cycle 1. Other ongoing studies in the
relapsed/refractory setting include isatuximab with poma-
lidomide–dexamethasone or carfilzomib (Table 2).
MOR202 in relapsed/refractory MM
An ongoing phase 1/2 study in relapsed/refractory mye-
loma (median of 4 prior therapies) showed that MOR202
was well tolerated and the maximum-tolerated dose has not
yet been reached (118). Infusion-related reactions occurred
in 31% of patients receiving MOR202 without dexametha-
sone, mainly during the first infusion (118, 119). There
were no infusion-related reactions when MOR202 was com-
bined with dexamethasone (118). In early cohorts, long-
lasting tumor control was observed (118). At a later stage,
the combination of MOR202 with lenalidomide–dexametha-
sone and pomalidomide–dexamethasone will also be evalu-
ated in the same study (118, 119).
CD38-targeting antibodies in newly diagnosed MM
Based on the efficacy and favorable toxicity profile of the
CD38-targeting antibodies in patients with relapsed/refrac-
tory MM, these agents are currently also evaluated in
patients with newly diagnosed MM.
The MAIA study is a randomized phase 3 study, which
will compare lenalidomide plus dexamethasone with or
without daratumumab in the setting of newly diagnosed
disease in MM patients not eligible for transplantation. In
addition, the randomized phase 3 ALCYONE study will
compare
bortezomib–melphalan–prednisone
(VMP)
with
VMP plus daratumumab in previously untreated MM patients
who are ineligible for autologous stem cell transplantation
(120). Furthermore, the HOVON and IFM study groups
have already started enrolling newly diagnosed MM patients
with age of ≤65 years in the Cassiopeia phase 3 randomized
trial. In this study patients will be treated with VTD (borte-
zomib–thalidomide–dexamethasone) with or without dara-
tumumab as induction therapy, followed by high-dose
melphalan with autologous stem cell rescue, and then 2
cycles of VTD with or without daratumumab as consolida-
tion. A second randomization will evaluate the value of
daratumumab in maintenance versus observation only. In
addition, daratumumab is evaluated with KRD (carfilzomib–
lenalidomide–dexamethasone)
in
newly
diagnosed
MM
patients.
Isatuximab will also be evaluated in the setting of newly
diagnosed disease in combination with cyclophosphamide,
bortezomib, and dexamethasone (CyVD).
Smoldering MM
Smoldering MM (SMM) is a precursor state of MM, character-
ized by M-protein ≥30 g/l or bone marrow plasma cell per-
centage of 10–60% without end-organ damage or presence of
biomarkers of malignancy (121, 122). Patients with SMM are
not treated until symptomatic disease develops. SMM is a
heterogeneous clinical entity with a subset of patients at high-
risk of progression (rate of progression: approximately 70% at
5 years) (123, 124). Importantly, a recent study in high-risk

van de Donk et al � CD38 as a target for antibody therapy
 SMM showed that lenalidomide–dexamethasone delayed pro-
gression to active disease and improved survival, when com-
pared to observation only (125). Since the presentation of
these promising results, several other studies in SMM have
been initiated including trials with monoclonal antibodies such
as siltuximab (anti-IL6), IPH2102 (anti-KIR2D) (126), and
elotuzumab (anti-SLAMF7), as well as daratumumab as a single
agent in three different dosing schedules (CENTAURUS study).
Host- and tumor-related factors that predict response
to CD38-targeting antibodies
We have demonstrated that CD38 expression levels are asso-
ciated with the efficacy of daratumumab to induce ADCC
and CDC in ex vivo experiments, and also with response to
daratumumab as single agent in the GEN501 and SIRIUS
studies (69, 127). Furthermore, we showed that during
treatment there was a significant decrease in CD38 expres-
sion on residual bone marrow-localized MM cells as well as
circulating tumor cells (127). Interestingly, in these two
daratumumab monotherapy studies, progressive disease was
associated with upregulation of the complement-inhibitory
proteins CD55 and CD59 (127). Expression of these com-
plement inhibitors was not different between responders
and non-responders before start of treatment (127). The
role of CD38 and complement inhibitors as determinants of
depth of response and development of resistance has to date
not been described for MOR202 and isatuximab.
Variation in genes involved in the immune response may
also be associated with response to CD38-targeted therapies.
Indeed, KIR and HLA genotypes predictive of high-affinity NK
cell
receptor–ligand
interactions
were
associated
with
improved clinical outcome in MM patients treated with isatux-
imab combined with lenalidomide and dexamethasone (128).
Other applications
Other CD38-positive hematologic malignancies
CD38 is not only expressed on MM cells but also in other
hematologic malignancies derived from both lymphoid and
myeloid lineages including non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (129),
acute myeloid leukemia (55), acute lymphoblastic leukemia
(55), as well as in CLL. However, the prevalence and expres-
sion levels of CD38 in these tumors are much lower com-
pared to MM. For instance, CD38 expression is found in 27–
46% of CLL cases and has been associated with aggressiveness
of disease and worse patient outcome (51, 130, 131). Pre-
clinical evidence shows that the CD38-targeting antibodies
have activity against these CD38-positive malignancies.
The CD38 antibodies daratumumab and MOR202 induced
potent killing of CD38-expressing lymphoma cells primarily
via ADCC and ADCP (63, 132–135). Similarly, isatuximab
kills lymphoma cells via ADCC and ADCP, and also has strong
proapoptotic activity in lymphoma in the absence of cross-
linking agents (64). Daratumumab also shows preclinical
anti-tumor activity against CD38-expressing CLL tumor cells
and inhibits adhesion and migration of CLL tumor cells in the
tumor microenvironment (133, 134), indicating that CD38-
targeting antibodies may also be of value in the treatment of
CD38-positive CLL. Due to relatively high expression of the
complement inhibitors and lower CD38 expression levels
compared to MM cells, daratumumab failed to effectively
induce CDC in most patient-derived NHL and CLL cells (133,
134). Nevertheless, daratumumab and isatuximab showed a
marked anti-tumor activity in mouse xenograft models of
NHL in vivo (63, 64, 134). Based on these results, daratu-
mumab is being evaluated in a phase 2 clinical trial in patients
with CD38-positive mantle cell lymphoma, diffuse large B-
cell lymphoma, or follicular lymphoma (Table 1). As only a
subset of NHL patients shows CD38 expression, patients
included in this study are selected based on CD38 expression.
A small number of patients with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma
were also included in the phase 1/2 study with isatuximab
monotherapy. However, so far outcome of these patients has
not been separately reported (117).
In preclinical models, daratumumab effectively inhibited
the growth of ALL tumors that express high levels of CD38
(136). Similarly, isatuximab was highly efficacious in a B-ALL
xenograft model (64), while CD38-targeting antibodies have
also shown activity against T-ALL cells (64). In acute myeloid
leukemia (AML) xenograft models, daratumumab signifi-
cantly reduced leukemia burden in peripheral blood and
spleen, but had no effect in the bone marrow, which suggests
that the bone marrow microenvironment can impair the anti-
leukemic activity of daratumumab (137). In contrast, studies
in MM models suggested that daratumumab can also effec-
tively mediate anti-tumor activity in the bone marrow envi-
ronment (63, 77, 86, 138). The precise role of the bone
marrow microenvironment in daratumumab susceptibility
remains to be elucidated. Finally, ongoing studies are testing
the combination of daratumumab with chemotherapeutic
drugs such as Ara-C and doxorubicin in AML mouse models
(137).
Immunomodulation

 cells (MDSCs) resulting in a decreased tumor growth rate in
an in vivo model of esophageal cancer (39). Increased num-
bers of CD38-positive MDSCs were also observed in the
blood of patients with advanced head and neck and non-
small cell lung cancer (39). Myeloid-derived suppressor cells
and a subset of regulatory T-cells (CD38+ Treg) have sus-
ceptibility to daratumumab-mediated cell lysis (Darzalex, US
prescribing information). These results are encouraging and
further studies toward the potential immunomodulatory
activity of CD38-targeting antibodies are warranted, includ-
ing for hematological and solid tumors that are CD38
negative.
Autoimmune disorders
Autoantibody production by plasma cells plays an important
role in the pathogenesis of several autoimmune diseases
such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), vasculitis,
autoimmune cytopenias, and rheumatoid arthritis. B-cell
depleting therapy with anti-CD20 or anti-CD22 monoclonal
antibodies is frequently used in autoimmunity to reduce
autoantibody
production,
antigen
presentation,
cytokine
production, and activation of T cells (139–141). However,
long-lived autoreactive plasma cells largely resist B-cell-
targeted therapy, and these non-eradicated plasma cells con-
tinue to produce autoantibodies (141, 142). Recently, it
was shown that CD19-negative bone marrow plasma cells,
which express CD38, are enriched in chronically inflamed
tissue and secrete autoantibodies (143).
While CD38-targeting antibodies were initially developed to
kill malignant plasma cells, these monoclonal antibodies may
also abrogate the production of autoantibodies in autoimmune
disorders and thereby reduce autoantibody-dependent effector
mechanisms. Therefore, treatment of patients with SLE and
other autoimmune disorders with anti-plasma cell antibodies
alone or in combination with standard-of-care therapies, may
be a new therapeutic approach. However, at this moment there
is no preclinical or clinical data available to estimate the impact
of plasma cell-directed therapy with CD38-targeting antibodies
on humoral autoimmunity.
Similarly, CD38 antibodies may mediate depletion of
allergen-specific IgG, A, or E secreting plasma cells that
maintain inflammatory processes. By employing this anti-
inflammatory action, anti-CD38 therapy may be beneficial
in patients with severe allergic conditions. Furthermore, in
transplantation medicine reduction in alloantibody levels
with an anti-CD38 antibody during acute rejection may
diminish transplant loss (142).
Resolving interference of daratumumab in clinical
laboratory assays
Interference of drugs in clinical laboratory tests is a well-
known problem (144). In particular therapeutic mAbs,
which are increasingly used in the clinic, are prone to inter-
fere in laboratory tests, as the selective antibody–antigen
interactions of therapeutic mAbs are sometimes similar to
the interactions employed by clinical laboratory tests. CD38
antibodies appear to interfere with clinical laboratory tests,
the indirect antiglobulin test (IAT), and serum protein and
immunofixation electrophoresis assays, causing unexpected
false-positive results. Various methods have been developed
to neutralize the interference of daratumumab in these
assays.
Indirect antiglobulin test
In clinical trials with daratumumab, some patients required
a blood transfusion (unrelated to daratumumab treatment).
All patients receiving daratumumab showed positive IATs,
which is used for the detection of irregular blood group
antibodies against donor red blood cells (145, 146). These
false-positive test results were caused by a fraction of red
blood cells, which appeared to express a low level of CD38.
A number of methods were established to neutralize the
interference of daratumumab in the blood typing test so that
proper identification of optimal donor blood is reestablished
(Fig. 3). Addition of a daratumumab-specific anti-idiotype
antibody or soluble CD38 (sCD38) antigen to the IAT plasma
sample neutralized the interference of daratumumab (145,
146). Alternatively, treatment of reagent red blood cells with
the reducing agent DTT also abrogated the interference of
daratumumab in the IAT (145). In the latter method, reduc-
tion in the disulfide bonds that are present in the extracellular
domain of CD38 (16) results in denaturation of the CD38
protein and abolishes binding of CD38 mAbs (147). A draw-
back of this method is that DTT denatures also a limited num-
ber of other blood group antigens, including Kell antigens
(145), but this can be managed by providing K-negative units
to these patients (145). Advantages of the CD38 denaturation
method are the widespread availability of DTT in blood banks
worldwide and the low costs.
Serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) and
immunofixation electrophoresis (IFE)
A known problem is the interference of therapeutic mAbs in
assays that monitor clonal myeloma protein (M-protein) as
a measure for disease burden in myeloma patients (148).

 Daratumumab is also detected on serum protein elec-
trophoresis (SPEP) and immunofixation (IFE) gels, and may
interfere with IMWG response criteria requiring negative
SPEP/IFE results to determine CR. A reflex assay was devel-
oped that uses a mouse anti-daratumumab antibody to shift
the IFE migration of daratumumab away from the range of
endogenous M-protein to be able to distinguish daratu-
mumab from M-protein (149). The assay was validated
using daratumumab-treated patient samples, in which M-
protein depletion could be detected without interference
with the therapeutic antibody. This allowed detection of a
CR under these conditions that was confirmed with addi-
tional clinical tests including bone marrow analysis (149).
Given that monoclonal antibody therapies are increasingly
being used to treat a wide range of diseases, this reflex assay
offers a potential solution to SPEP and serum IFE interference
that occurs with a number of other therapeutic antibodies.
Conclusions and future perspectives
The multifunctional cell surface protein CD38 possesses
receptor as well as enzyme functions. CD38 is expressed in a
subset of hematological tumors, and shows particularly broad
and high expression levels in MM. Together, this pointed to
CD38 as an attractive therapeutic target and triggered the
development of various therapeutic CD38 antibodies, includ-
ing daratumumab, isatuximab, and MOR202. These CD38-
targeting antibodies have a favorable toxicity profile in
patients and early clinical data show a marked activity in MM.
Recent advances with novel classes of drugs, including
proteasome inhibitors and immunomodulatory agents, have
significantly improved the prospects of MM patients. How-
ever, the vast majority of patients will eventually develop
disease that is refractory to all available agents, which con-
fers a very poor prognosis (56). Novel approaches, includ-
ing immunotherapy with mAbs, are being explored to force
a breakthrough and to significantly improve the outcome
for this population of patients. In addition to CD38 mAbs,
other therapeutic antibodies are in clinical development in
MM, including antibodies directed against SLAMF7/CS1
(elotuzumab)
and
B
cell-activating
factor
(tabalumab)
(150). Except for CD38 antibodies, none of these mAbs
have shown anti-myeloma activity as single agents, but
enhancement of the anti-tumor efficacy was noted in com-
bination with other agents (62). Also combinations of
immunomodulatory agents and proteasome inhibitors with
CD38 mAbs show much promise in preclinical studies and
early clinical data. Many clinical studies are currently evalu-
ating daratumumab and other CD38 mAbs in combination
with various different anti-myeloma regimens (Tables 1–3).
An improved understanding of mechanisms that con-
tribute to innate or acquired resistance to CD38-targeted
antibodies may result in the rational design of new anti-
body-based combinations with higher anti-MM activity.
Variables that have an impact on clinical outcome include
host-related factors such as frequency and activity of effec-
tor cells which may be affected by various anti-MM thera-
pies. Furthermore, tumor-related factors such as target
antigen expression levels, expression of complement-inhibi-
tory proteins, expression of inhibitory receptors such as
PD-L1, which inhibits PD-1-positive NK and T cells, or
CD47, which impairs phagocytosis, may impact clinical
outcome (96, 151). Also genetic variations in certain genes

Fig. 3. Resolving interference of daratumumab in the indirect
antiglobulin test (IAT). (A, B) Daratumumab in the patient’s serum
binds to the test RBCs. After adding the anti-IgG reagent, RBC
agglutination is observed, thereby generating a false-positive result (A)
or masking the presence of irregular antibodies (B). (C, D)
Daratumumab-specific anti-idiotype antibodies are added to the
patient’s serum and bind to daratumumab (1). Alternatively, test RBCs
are treated with DTT, resulting in denaturation of CD38 and loss of
daratumumab binding (2). If the patient has no irregular antibodies,
binding of daratumumab to RBCs is blocked generating a negative IAT
test result. However, if the serum contains irregular antibodies,
binding of these antibodies to RBC will result in a true positive IAT
test result.

van de Donk et al � CD38 as a target for antibody therapy
 including FccR polymorphisms (152) and KIR (128) may
influence response to monoclonal antibody-based therapy.
These mechanisms are currently analyzed in detail in the
studies with daratumumab and other CD38-targeting anti-
bodies.
In addition to MM, CD38 expression is observed in vari-
ous other hematological malignancies, such as NHL and
CLL, suggesting that CD38 mAbs may be active in these
indications as well. However, unlike myelomas only a subset
of lymphomas expresses CD38 urging the need for selection
of CD38-positive tumors that are eligible for treatment with
CD38 mAbs.
Appreciating CD38 as an attractive therapeutic target in
hematological malignancies, novel therapeutic approaches
are being explored that target CD38, including CD38-speci-
fic CAR T cells (153) and CD3xCD38 bispecific antibodies
(67). These strategies show promise in preclinical models,
but their activity in the clinic remains to be tested.
In addition, following on the success of both rituximab
and trastuzumab with regard to development of subcutaneous
delivery of monoclonal antibodies in oncology, subcutaneous
delivery of daratumumab in combination with recombinant
human hyaluronidase is currently ongoing. A subcutaneous
product will offer significant advantages over IV delivery in
terms of its convenience for delivery and potential side effect
profile. A phase 1 study is currently ongoing in the relapsed/
refractory setting of myeloma.
In conclusion, CD38 is an emerging therapeutic target for
the treatment of hematological malignancies, in particular
MM. The CD38 mAb daratumumab has shown encouraging
activity as single agent in heavily pretreated MM patients.
Daratumumab has differentiating mechanisms of action and
a limited toxicity profile, which allows favorable combina-
tion therapies with existing as well as emerging therapies. It
is expected that the introduction of CD38 mAbs as a novel
treatment option will significantly contribute to improved
outcomes of myeloma patients. Furthermore, daratumumab
has therapeutic potential in indications beyond MM, in par-
ticular in other CD38-positive hematological malignancies.
Recent, exciting data indicate that CD38-targeted inhibition
of myeloid-derived suppressor cells could mediate anti-
tumor activity through the release of T-cell suppression. In
addition to hematological tumors, this immune stimulatory
potential suggests a role for CD38 antibodies in the treat-
ment of solid tumors, however, further studies addressing
this are warranted. Finally, the expression of CD38 on
plasma cells may provide opportunities for the treatment of
antibody-mediated
autoimmune
diseases
using
CD38-
targeted therapies.
