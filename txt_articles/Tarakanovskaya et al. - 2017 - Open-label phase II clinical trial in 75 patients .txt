Background: An increasing number of studies is now devoted to immunotherapy of cancer. We 
evaluated the clinical benefit of hepcortespenlisimut-L (Hepko-V5 [formerly known as V5])—an 
oral therapeutic vaccine designated by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
as an orphan drug for treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). V5 was initially developed 
by us in 2002 to treat hepatitis B or C viral infections and liver cirrhosis.
Methods: The outcome of open-label Phase II trial of daily dose of V5 pill was analyzed retro-
spectively. Over a period of 5 years, 75 patients with advanced HCC were enrolled, consisting of 
29 (38.7%) females and 46 (61.3%) males with a median age of 60 years (mean 61.6±8.1 years). 
Out of these, 23 (30.7%) had hepatitis B and 34 (45.3%) had hepatitis C infections, including 9 
(12%) with dual infection, 4 (5.3%) negative for both viruses, and 5 (6.7%) without established 
viral diagnosis. Most patients (94.7%) had underlying liver cirrhosis of varying severity.
Results: After a median of 2 months of treatment, 50 out of 75 patients had experienced a decline 
in serum levels of the tumor marker, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) (66.7%; P=0.006 by Wilcoxon 
signed rank test). Baseline median AFP levels were 245.2 IU/mL (mean 4,233; range 7.2–92,407; 
95% confidence interval [CI] 1,186–7,280) and post-treatment values were 102.3 IU/mL (mean 
2,539; range 0.9–54,478; 95% CI 503–4,575). The decrease in AFP was correlated either with 
tumor clearance or regression on computed tomography scans. The median overall survival 
time could not be established since 68 out of 75 (90.7%) patients were still alive after median 
follow-up of 12 months (mean 15±9.7; range 7–59; 95% CI 12.8–17.2). The first patient in this 
study received immunotherapy 5 years ago and still remains in complete remission. None of 
the patients experienced any serious adverse effects or toxicity.
Conclusion: The results indicate that hepcortespenlismut-L is a safe, effective, and fast-acting 
immunomodulatory intervention for HCC. The Phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled trial is now initiated at the Mongolian National Cancer Center to confirm these 
promising findings.

Background
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the second most common cause of death from 
cancer, estimated to be responsible for 818,000 deaths or 9.9% of total cancer fatali-
ties in 2013.1 Even though the incidence of HCC is low in North America and most 
of Europe, it has almost doubled in these places since the 1990s. Liver cancer is 
largely a problem of countries in East Asia and sub-Saharan Africa where 83% (50% 
in China alone) of the estimated 792,000 new cases occurred in 2013. Unfortunately,

Tarakanovskaya et al
Mongolia occupies the leading position in the world; it has 
6 times higher than average global incidence of HCC, which 
is attributed to the excessive prevalence of chronic viral B 
and C hepatitis, alcohol consumption, and liver cirrhosis.2–9
Close to 90% of HCC cases in Mongolia are diagnosed 
in an advanced stage when common therapeutic interven-
tions, such as resection, chemoembolization, radiofrequency 
ablation, or liver transplantation, are not feasible anymore.2 
Although sorafenib (Nexavar) is available as a chemotherapy 
option, it is seldom used due to high cost and low efficacy 
combined with adverse effects. Thus, the need for a safer, 
more effective, and affordable treatments remain unfulfilled. 
The concept of liver cancer immunotherapy has gained 
popularity in recent years.10 Several clinical trials of HCC 
immunotherapy were reported; some of these suggested 
that this approach might be useful for patients with liver 
tumors.10–21 Nevertheless, despite intensive research effort 
during last 20 years, no proven immunotherapy has emerged 
for HCC indication.
Orally administered immune modulator previously 
known as V5 has been used in Mongolia since 2007. The 
accumulated clinical experience in over 10,000 patients in 
about 30 additional countries indicates that V5 is safe and 
effective for a range of clinical indications. Published clini-
cal trials have shown the outstanding safety and beneficial 
effect of V5 in patients with chronic viral hepatitis and liver 
cirrhosis.22–25 V5 is a tableted, off-shelf formulation derived 
from heat-inactivated, hydrolyzed, pooled blood of hepatitis B 
and C carriers, prepared according to proprietary technology 
developed by us back in 2002.22
In 2010, we had our first patient who presented with viral 
hepatitis C and decompensated liver cirrhosis along with 
diagnosis of inoperable HCC. The patient was discharged 
from the hospital as incurable with less than 3 months to 
live. As there were no other treatment options available, he 
decided to take 1 pill of V5 a day so that his failing liver can 
be rescued. Surprisingly, after about 4 months on V5, the 
patient experienced complete remission. The tumor clearance 
coincided with the normalization of baseline plasma level 
of HCC tumor marker, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), dropping 
from 428.7 to 2.5 IU/mL. This favorable outcome led to sign-
ing up additional HCC patients, and changes in AFP were 
employed as surrogate marker of response to immunotherapy 
since most patients could not afford the cost of computed 
tomography (CT) scan. Results were encouraging to the 
point that V5 has received an orphan drug status designation 
from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
with assigned generic name hepcortespenlisimut-L. Here, 
we present detailed account of earlier reported conference 
abstract on hepcortespenlisimut-L (Hepko-V5) intervention 
in a 75-patient cohort in advanced stage of HCC.26
Methods
patients
A total of 75 HCC patients were evaluated in this retrospec-
tive study conducted from December 2010 till November 
2015 (Table 1). The patients consisted of 29 (38.7%) 
females and 46 (61.3%) males with a median age of 60 years 
(mean 61.6±8.1 years). Out of these, 23 (30.7%) had hepa-
titis B and 34 (45.3%) had hepatitis C infections, including

Hepcortespenlisimut-l for advanced HCC
9 (12%) with dual infection, 4 (5.3%) negative for both 
viruses, and 5 (6.7%) without established viral diagnosis. 
Most patients (94.7%), except 4, had hepatic cirrhosis due to 
hepatitis B or C virus chronic infection, often with history of 
alcohol abuse. One case of cirrhosis due to hereditary hemo-
chromatosis and 3 cryptogenic cases without known etiol-
ogy were part of the cohort. All patients were in advanced 
stage of HCC and unfit for standard therapy, ie, surgical 
intervention, either due to tumor size or their location or 
multiplicity. Many patients had single or multiple events of 
recurrent lesions after surgical intervention, such as resec-
tion, transarterial embolization, radiofrequency ablation, 
percutaneous ethanol injection, or their combinations. Only 
3 patients received FDA-approved first-line drug, sorafenib, 
which in all 3 cases has been discontinued shortly after 
treatment initiation due to intolerable adverse side effects, 
perceived lack of efficacy, and/or excessive cost. At the 
presentation, all the patients were either under palliative 
care or pronounced incurable without available treatment 
options—underlining the disease gravity. As the majority 
of our HCC patients were in terminal stage of the disease, 
they often presented with a variety of symptoms related to 
decompensated cirrhosis including ascites, edema, vari-
ceal bleeding, portal thrombi, and hepatic encephalopathy. 
Besides these symptoms, abdominal discomfort and less 
frequently pain were common (80%). Other encountered 
complaints were fatigue or weakness, cachexia, anorexia, 
skin itch, bleeding from gums and nose, vomiting, and 
jaundice. As no other intervention options except palliative 
care were available, patients consented to receive once-per-
day pill of V5 in an open-label setting. In such a way, we 
had a cohort representative of real-life situation in Mon-
golia, where almost every patient is diagnosed only after 
symptoms of the disease become apparent or when tumors 
recur. The primary endpoints were changes in serum AFP 
levels, tumor burden, and overall survival (OS). This study 
was registered on September 24, 2014 at ClinicalTrials.gov 
registry site with  ID: NCT02256514.
inclusion and exclusion criteria
The following criteria were set up for participation in this 
study.
inclusion criteria
1) HCC diagnosis documented prior to study either by dis-
ease history, histology, CT scan, or positive AFP serum test 
prior to entry and 2) both men and non-pregnant women who 
were at least 18 years old and willing to provide informed 
consent. Those who met inclusion criteria were eligible for 
retrospective evaluation as long as they had baseline AFP 
values available.
exclusion criteria
1) Pregnant or breast-feeding women; 2) subjects who have 
already taken V5 in prior trials or had no baseline lab data; 
3) subjects who have taken other immunomodulating drugs 
within 2 months prior to entry, including systemic corticoste-
roids, intravenous immune globulin, interferons, interleukins, 
pentoxifylline, thalidomide, filgrastim (granulocyte colony-
stimulating factor), sargramostim (granulocyte macrophage 
colony-stimulating factor), dinitrochlorobenzene, thymosin 
alpha, thymopentin, inosiplex, polyribonucleoside (Amp-
ligen), ditiocarb sodium (Imuthiol), or any other locally 
available immune modulators, or any other cancer vaccine; 
4) those with evidence of active or acute cardiac disease, 
epilepsy, or life-threatening acute diseases unrelated to 
HCC; and 5) medical conditions, such as active alcohol or 
substance abuse, or psychological issues that in the opinion 
of the local investigator would interfere with adherence to 
treatment regimen of this study.
Hepcortespenlisimut-l (Hepko-V5)
V5 is derived from hydrolyzed pooled blood of hepatitis B 
and C carriers, whereas Hepko-V5 is derived from pooled 
blood of HBV+ and HCV+ donors diagnosed with HCC. 
The founding principle for making V5 is not much different 
from established practice of manufacturing old-fashioned 
killed vaccines, eg, hepatitis B vaccine made from pooled 
plasma. The process of manufacturing is described in detail – 
it involves heat and chemical inactivation with subsequent 
formulation into a tablet capable to withstand digestive 
degradation in the stomach.22 The manufacturing process 
eliminates potentially infectious hepatitis B and C viruses as 
evidenced by serology and PCR analysis of the tablets. V5 has 
been approved as an immunomodulating biologically active 
product in Mongolia since 2007. The recommended dose is 
1–2 pills per day. The preparation is stable at ambient room 
temperature for 3 years. In December 2014, hepcortespenli-
simut-L received orphan drug status designation (#457714) 
for treatment of HCC from the FDA. Along with this generic 
name, the brand name Hepko-V5 has been chosen for use in 
Phase III, placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blinded 
trial currently underway in Mongolia at the National Cancer 
Center (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT02232490).

administration schedule and monitoring
Treatment was administered in an outpatient setting. The 
patients were instructed to take orally once-daily pill of V5. 
They were free to stop treatment at any time. This report 
comprises only those patients who had baseline and post-
treatment AFP values measured by routine lab methods. 
No other exclusion criteria were applied. In such a manner, 
the patient sample was maximally close to a real-life demo-
graphic distribution of HCC in the Mongolian population.
Statistical analysis
The primary endpoint for this study was effect of V5 on serum 
AFP levels along with OS and tumor burden changes. Sec-
ondary objectives were safety, adverse effects, and changes 
in clinical symptoms. The difference between pre- and post-
treatment parametric values was assessed by Student’s t-test 
and linear regression analysis. Wilcoxon matched pairs rank-
ing test and c2 contingency table analysis were employed for 
categorical data. Comparison of survival curves was analyzed 
by log-rank test (StatMost, Datamost Inc., South Sandy, UT, 
USA). The significance level was set at P≤0.05.
ethics approval and consent to 
participate
All patients provided informed consent (oral or written) 
and were explained benefits and risks of the intervention. 
The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board 
of Immunitor LLC (#IRB00010671) and conducted in 
accordance with declaration of Helsinki with good clini-
cal practice as defined by the International Conference on 
Harmonization.
Results
Subjects
The patients entered the study in a staggered fashion over 
the period of 59 months between December 2010 and 
November 2015—the censoring time point. They have been 
receiving immunotherapy for various periods of time. The 
median duration of the therapy between time of AFP mea-
surement at baseline and next AFP test was 2 months (mean 
± standard deviation [SD] 2.75±2.45; 95% confidence inter-
val [CI] 2.2–3.3) (Figure 1). Treatment was extremely well 
tolerated; no adverse side effects due to V5 were observed 
in any of treated patients. As per previous experience 
with hepatitis and cirrhosis patients, V5 produced almost 
immediate relief from symptoms of the disease. Fatigue 
and abdominal pain or discomfort were the most common 
symptoms that were reported as improved within 1 week 
from treatment initiation. The period over which patients 
have been followed up was considerably longer. The average 
follow-up time was 15±9.7 months with median 12 months 
(range 7–59 months; 95% CI 12.8–17.2). Figure 2 shows 
distribution of patients in terms of the length of follow-up 
in relation to number of patients in each time category, eg, 
5 patients were followed up for 7 months and 1 patient for 
59 months, bars on the left and right side of the histogram, 
respectively. Unpaired t-test has not revealed any disparity 
between the length of follow-up and type of viral hepatitis 
infection. The mean ± SD (median) of those with hepatitis 
B virus (HBV) vs. hepatitis C virus (HCV) were practically 
identical, ie, 13.7±5.4 (11.5) vs. 15.8±11.4 (12) months, 
respectively (P=0.34). Among 7 deceased patients, 1 had 
dual infection, 1 was negative for both viruses, with 2 and 3 
individuals diagnosed with HBV and HCV
, respectively. As 
numbers were small, no statistical power has been reached to 
determine which type of virus was more lethal (P=0.56 by 
c2 analysis). Due to low number of double negatives (N=4), 
the statistical power was not sufficient to conclude anything 
of significance. Nevertheless, in 3 out of 4 double negative 
patients, AFP levels declined (75%), which is in line with 
the response rate of remaining patients, ie, 38 out of 54 
(70.4%) patients. The difference between outcomes was 
negligible (P=0.94). Similar results were seen when double 
positives were compared to the remainder of patients with 
the response rate being 6 out of 9 (66.7%) and 43 out of 65 
(66.2%), respectively (P=0.99). Thus, regardless of distinct 
viral diagnoses, the outcome was essentially the same, at 
least statistically, meaning that V5 acts independently from 
the underlying viral status.

Hepcortespenlisimut-l for advanced HCC
Safety and adverse effects
We have not seen any toxicity at any point in this study. V5 
has been clinically investigated since 2002—the time point 
when we initiated series of studies to assess its safety, first in 
animals and then in human subjects. No toxicity or adverse 
effects were observed in the past in animals or in vitro, 
nor in any 21 clinical trials of the same drug, nor in any of 
10,000 individuals who used V5 since 2007—year when it 
has been first approved for commercial use for a wide variety 
of unrelated indications.
overall survival
At censoring cutoff time point, ie, November 2015, 7 out of 
75 patients died, which corresponds to OS rate of 90.7% as 
shown in Figure 3. The median OS has not been reached. To 
Figure 3, we have added the survival curve from Phase III 
Sorafenib Hepatocellular Carcinoma Assessment Randomized 
Protocol (SHARP) study for comparison, which evaluated 
FDA-approved first-line chemotherapy, sorafenib, in HCC 
patients with relatively normal liver function.27 Visually and 
statistically, 2 survival curves were significantly different in 
favor of V5 (P<0.001). This difference was not biased by 
patients’ baseline health status. Judging from baseline Child-
Pugh (CP) scores reflecting liver performance, patients in our 
trial were in worse shape than participants in SHARP study, ie, 
in CP-A 16% vs. 95% and CP-B 50.6% vs. 5%, respectively. 
No patients in CP-C stage were enrolled in SHARP study, 
while one-third (33.4%) of V5 recipients were in the last 
stage of liver disease. The c2 2×2 contingency table analysis 
comparing baseline CP-A and CP-B classes among patients 
on V5 and sorafenib confirms this impression (P<0.0001). 
When we analyzed our data, we did employ various subgroup 
analyses to see if any correlates or predictors of V5 efficacy 
might have been revealed. Obviously, liver performance was 
one of the parameters that we were interested to evaluate in 
relation to the clinical outcome. Although one may assume 
that patients with poor liver function would fare worse, in 
Figure 2 absolute number of HCC patients, as shown on Y-axis, followed up for 7–59 months (X-axis). The median follow-up time is 12 months (mean ± SD 15±9.7; range 
7–59; 95% Ci 12.8–17.2).

reality this was not the case. No correlation was found between 
liver cirrhosis stages and rate of AFP response. We interpret 
this as if the immune response was not dependent from status 
of the liver. The response rate of HCC patients with CP-B 
and CP-C classes was essentially the same, with intergroup 
difference that was not statistically significant.
aFp
Median baseline AFP level was 245.2 IU/mL (mean ± SD 
4,332.6±13,243.6; range 7.2–92,407; 95% CI 1,186–7,280) 
and corresponding post-treatment value was 102.3 IU/mL 
(mean ± SD: 2,538.4±8,848.6; range 0.9–54,478; 95% 
CI 503–4,575). Judging from AFP response, 50 out of 75 
patients had experienced a decrease in AFP levels (66.7%). 
Wilcoxon signed rank test used as non-parametric counterpart 
to the parametric paired t-test has revealed highly significant 
difference (P=0.006). The response rate of patients with low 
baseline levels of AFP compared to those with high levels 
of AFP was similar. According to stratified analysis, 11 out 
of 19 patients with AFP ≤40 IU had their tumor marker 
levels declined (57.9%), while 38 out of 55 with higher 
AFP appeared to respond to treatment (69.1%). One patient 
whose AFP level has not changed has been excluded from 
this analysis. The c2 contingency 2×2 table analysis reveals 
that 2-tailed P-value is equal to 0.68, meaning that there is 
no statistical difference in outcome between groups with low 
and high baseline AFP levels. Figure 4 shows the dynamics 
of changes in AFP levels over median of 2 months. At study 
initiation, patients were distributed in a classic Gaussian 
manner across pre-specified ranges of AFP values with 
peak number of patients belonging to 40–400 IU/mL range 
with smaller populations having AFP either below 10 IU/
mL (N=4) or above 50,000 IU/mL (N=2) at the tails of the 
bell curve. Post-treatment distribution curve of patients had 
shifted to the left with number of patients increasing 3-fold 
in <10 IU/mL range (N=12), which is considered as normal 
level of AFP
. Only 1 patient remained in high >50,000 IU/mL 
AFP group; however, this was patient #9 who had a baseline 
value of 13,298 IU/mL, which then increased to 54,478 IU/
mL. Coincidentally, this patient deceased after 3 months of 
treatment. Original 2 patients in this group, #12 and #67, had 
their AFP values going down from 92,407 and 60,844 IU/
mL to 2.3 and 48,619 IU/mL, respectively. Linear regression 
analysis suggests that the difference between 2 curves is sig-
nificant (R2=0.76; P=0.02), confirming this visual impression.
Tumor burden
Both of the aforementioned clinical endpoints, ie, OS 
and decrease in AFP levels, were in favor of V5 interven-
tion. Abdominal CT scans, when available, indicated that 
AFP-lowering effect of V5 coincided with reduced tumor 
burden. Unfortunately, only about 1 out of 10 patients could 
afford the cost of CT scans. Nevertheless, we provide rep-
resentative images to illustrate our results. The decrease in 
AFP correlated with tumor shrinkage or clearance. This is 
clearly visible, for example, in patient #24 who could afford 
serial monthly measurements of AFP and bimonthly CT 
scans ( 
Figures 5 and 6). The tumor-shrinking effect of hep-
cortespenlisimut was obvious within a very short period of 
time, clearly visible within 3 weeks from treatment initiation 
(Figure 7). In cases where AFP levels were down below upper 
limit of normal levels, lesions were cleared (Figures 8 and 9). 
These examples indicate that reduction in tumor burden is 
positively associated with decline in AFP levels.
Discussion
The annual incidence of HCC and liver cirrhosis in Mon-
golia is the highest in the world standing at 61.9 and 350 
per 100,000.2–9 Such a high rate has been attributed to the 
excessive prevalence of chronic viral hepatitis estimated to 
occur in about one-third of the population. Most of patients 
with HCC are diagnosed at an advanced stage of the cancer 
and commonly present with impaired liver function. As a 
Figure 4 increase in proportion of patients having lower levels of aFp after a median 
of 2 months, as shown in their absolute number plotted against Y-axis in relation to 
pre-set range of aFp plasma concentrations (shown on horizontal axis) into which 
they fall before (solid line) and after (dotted line) immunotherapy. Baseline median 
aFp level was 245.2 iU/ml (mean 4,233; range 7.2–92,407; 95% Ci 1,186–7,280) 
and post-treatment value was 102.3 iU/ml (mean 2,539; range 0.9–54,478; 95% 
Ci 503–4,575). There is a clear shift to the left toward lower concentrations of 
post-treatment aFp values compared to baseline distribution curve, which was 
statistically significant (R2=0.76; P=0.02).

serious adverse reaction or toxicity. In only one instance, a 
patient had complained of deleterious side effects, but these 
were found to be caused by concomitant sorafenib use. The 
patients who received one daily pill of V5 were, as a rule, 
extremely satisfied; the resolution of their clinical symptoms 
such as fatigue or abdominal pain often occurred after the first 
administered dose. Due to the tangible effect on well-being 
and improvement in liver function the drug adherence was 
outstanding. For example, Figure 7 shows the resolution of 
ascites resulting from dysfunctional liver within 3 weeks. 
Nevertheless, it is clear that V5 is not a panacea; 7 patients 
out of 75 had died by study termination in November 2015 
(Figure 3).
The major objective of any oncology trial is OS, which 
determines the value of an experimental drug. The median 
follow-up of patients was 12 months, by that time point 
90.7% of patients were still alive, which is significantly better 
(P<0.0001 by c2 contingency table) than historical, 1-year 
survival rate among Mongolian patients with HCC.3 Due to 
low mortality rate, the median OS of patients on V5 was not 
established. As our drug was administered in an open-label 
setting, we have used published survival curve from Phase 
III sorafenib trial to compare our outcome ( 
Figure 3). The 
difference in survival curves is visually distinct and statisti-
cally significant in favor of V5 as supported by log-rank test 
(P<0.001). While such results appear outstanding, it is clear 
that one needs controlled trial to confirm our initial findings. 
The placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized Phase 
III trial has been initiated last year at the National Cancer 
Center in Mongolia.
Higher serum levels of AFP
, the most common HCC 
biomarker, are associated with severity of the disease. As the 
SHARP study has not revealed the evidence of correlation 
Figure 5 plots expressed as percent (Y-axis) of baseline monthly values of aFp 
and bimonthly tumor size measurements by CT scan in patient #24 who had them 
evaluated for 7 months (X-axis). Changes in tumor burden were estimated by 
summing up perpendicular diameters of each lesion. aFp level in this patient was 
measured in ng/ml instead of usual units expressed in iU/ml. These values were 
converted into percentage figures relative to baseline values shown as 100% on 
Y-axis against X-axis showing number of months on follow-up. linear regression 
analysis based on observed values shows strong dependency between these variables 
(R2=0.96; P=0.02) indicating that this relationship is unlikely to be random meaning 
that decrease in aFp was positively correlated with tumor burden reduction.

Figure 6 Three consecutive abdominal CT scans of patient #24 carried out in June, august, and December 2014 as shown in three panels from left to right. When treatment 
initiated in July 2014, the patient had an aFp level of 47,937 ng/ml and 7 malignant lesions including thrombus in the portal vein, which recurred after ablation of 2 original 
primary tumors (12×11 and 11.1×10.4 cm in right lobe) in February 2014; in august 2014, after 3 weeks on V5, tumor sizes decreased by one third at which point aFp 
declined to 11,557 ng/ml. after 5 months on daily pill of hepcortespenlisimut-l, 4 out 7 lesions including thrombus cleared with remaining shrinking to under 1 cm at which 
time point aFp dropped down to 10.5 ng/ml—slightly above of what is considered the normal range between 0 and 8 ng/ml. Scans show planes with location of the largest 
lesion, which was later recognized as a cyst. By September 2016 all malignant lesions were cleared and aFp declined to 6.8 ng/ml.

result, over 90% of patients are not eligible for locoregional 
intervention, and systemic chemotherapy with sorafenib 
is seldom used due to high cost and limited benefit. Better 
therapies to treat liver cancer and underlying hepatic dysfunc-
tion are badly needed.
This retrospective study summarizes our experience of 
administering Hepko-V5 to patients with advanced HCC, all 
of whom had exhausted other treatment options. Similarly 
to our prior experience with V5 in patients with chronic 
hepatitis B and C or liver cirrhosis, the treatment was safe 
and well tolerated; not a single patient had experienced any

between changes in AFP and clinical response or improved 
survival, most experts in HCC field assumed that this marker 
is not reliable as a surrogate for clinical outcome.28 However, 
there is a significant body of evidence arguing against this 
consensus. There are, for example, multiple case reports of 
spontaneous regression of HCC; in cases where AFP was 
evaluated at baseline, there is a consistent correlation with 
decrease or normalization of tumor marker.29–32 There are also 
various immunotherapy trial reports pointing out that decrease 
in AFP was associated with favorable clinical response.15–21

that have analyzed changes in AFP as a  
prognostic marker

Hepcortespenlisimut-l for advanced HCC
in systemic and locoregional interventions for HCC.33–34 
Finally, post-SHARP clinical trials have indicated that the 
decline in AFP was a strong predictive factor of response to 
sorafenib.35–40 These studies lend support to our rationale of 
relying on AFP as a surrogate marker. Thus, HCC is not differ-
ent from other cancer types where tumor-associated markers 
decline or disappear if drugs are truly effective.
HCC is a classic example of cancer caused by chronic 
inflammation.41 This is not a secret and has been known since 
Rudolf Virchow’s times in the 19th century that cancer is an 
inflammatory disease.42 According to Virchow, immune reac-
tive cells that attack the tumor actually stimulate proliferation 
of cancerous cells. The only way to overcome this unhealthy 
relationship is to induce the immune tolerance. There are 2 
practical ways to induce immune tolerance: parenterally, by 
injecting very small doses of offending antigen or by feed-
ing antigen orally.43 Judging from our preliminary in vitro 
investigations, physiologically relevant doses of V5 produce 
within 2 days a potent anti-inflammatory response reflected 
in a 10-fold decrease of key inflammatory cytokine tumor 
necrosis factor-α and at the same time manifold increase in 
frequency of interferon-g secreting CD4 and CD8 T cells 
expressing proliferation markers Ki-67 and CD69 (unpub-
lished, 2010). V5 has been extensively used by us to treat 
hepatitis and tuberculosis—2 diseases that have in common 
with HCC only one underlying characteristic—the inflam-
matory immune reaction directed against self.22–25,44
The precise mechanism of V5 action remains to be eluci-
dated. Our working hypothesis is based on a counterintuitive 
premise that is opposite to the prevailing dogma in the field, 
which postulates that the immune response in cancer patients 
is weakened or rendered immune tolerant and thus the immune 
reaction needs to be unleashed in order to destroy malig-
nant cells.45 We strongly believe that this notion is wrong in 
most cases. In fact, all of the current cancer immunotherapy 
approaches, eg, checkpoint inhibitors, based on such a prin-
ciple have resulted in modest clinical success (<10%) and trig-
gered autoimmune reactions of inflammatory nature in most 
patients (~85%), which are directed against a wide range of 
bystander cells unrelated to tumor cells.46,47 The outcome of our 
immunotherapy, which is far more effective and safer, suggests 
that we are on a path that the mainstream approach has not 
taken into account. Nevertheless, a growing body of evidence 
indicates that neutralizing tumor-promoting inflammation is, 
perhaps, the most optimal course we should be heading to.48
Conclusion
The anti-cancer activity of V5 was discovered by us acci-
dentally 7 years ago when we treated our first patient with 
incurable HCC who also happened to have hepatitis C and 
liver cirrhosis—indications for which V5 has been developed 
originally. Encouraged by complete clearance of lesions in that 
individual, other HCC patients came forward asking for V5.26 
The present report details the outcome of this immunotherapy 
in 75 non-selected patients with advanced HCC. Our results 
indicate that V5 is a safe, effective, and fast-acting immune 
intervention for HCC. The AFP appears to be a valid predictive 
biomarker for assessing clinical response. We do acknowledge 
that there are several deficiencies in our study that are evident, 
but due to retrospective nature it is too late to fix them. In 
order to substantiate these preliminary findings a prospective 
placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind study has been 
initiated and we expect to have results in near future.
Acknowledgments
We are grateful to all our patients and their families who 
entrusted their lives to us. We regret profoundly for not 
being able to help them all. We are particularly indebted to 
Dr. Steve and Mrs. Jane Kramer and many other patients 
and well-wishers in Mongolia and around the globe who 
provided their generous donations, which we humbly 
accepted to advance our clinical work. Without them, this 
project could have been halted or delayed indefinitely. We 
thank Prof. Peter Nyasulu, biostatistician at the Monash 
University, for his valiant effort to unravel the survival data 
from SHARP study. The abstract of this paper was presented 
Figure 9 patient #12 presented with single large tumor in September 2013 (shown in the left panel), which was removed surgically. in January 2014, multiple new lesions 
appeared in left lobe, which were not amenable to surgical intervention (panel in the center). at this time, his aFp concentration was extremely high (92,407 iU/ml)—no 
one in our entire cohort of 75 patients had more than that. in September 2014, the patient’s aFp levels reduced to 2.3 iU/ml and there were no visible lesions on CT scan 
(right panel). Between January and September, the patient received V5 intermittently for a total of 7 months. The patient is still alive and doing well.
