Summary
Background The incidence of microcephaly in Brazil in 2015 was 20 times higher than in previous years. Congenital 
microcephaly is associated with genetic factors and several causative agents. Epidemiological data suggest that 
microcephaly cases in Brazil might be associated with the introduction of Zika virus. We aimed to detect and sequence 
the Zika virus genome in amniotic fl
 uid samples of two pregnant women in Brazil whose fetuses were diagnosed 
with microcephaly.
Methods In this case study, amniotic fl
 uid samples from two pregnant women from the state of Paraíba in Brazil 
whose fetuses had been diagnosed with microcephaly were obtained, on the recommendation of the Brazilian health 
authorities, by ultrasound-guided transabdominal amniocentesis at 28 weeks’ gestation. The women had presented at 
18 weeks’ and 10 weeks’ gestation, respectively, with clinical manifestations that could have been symptoms of Zika 
virus infection, including fever, myalgia, and rash. After the amniotic fl
 uid samples were centrifuged, DNA and RNA 
were extracted from the purifi
 ed virus particles before the viral genome was identifi
 ed by quantitative reverse 
transcription PCR and viral metagenomic next-generation sequencing. Phylogenetic reconstruction and investigation 
of recombination events were done by comparing the Brazilian Zika virus genome with sequences from other Zika 
strains and from fl
 aviviruses that occur in similar regions in Brazil.
Findings We detected the Zika virus genome in the amniotic fl
 uid of both pregnant women. The virus was not detected 
in their urine or serum. Tests for dengue virus, chikungunya virus, Toxoplasma gondii, rubella virus, cytomegalovirus, 
herpes simplex virus, HIV, Treponema pallidum, and parvovirus B19 were all negative. After sequencing of the 
complete genome of the Brazilian Zika virus isolated from patient 1, phylogenetic analyses showed that the virus 
shares 97–100% of its genomic identity with lineages isolated during an outbreak in French Polynesia in 2013, and 
that in both envelope and NS5 genomic regions, it clustered with sequences from North and South America, southeast 
Asia, and the Pacifi
 c. After assessing the possibility of recombination events between the Zika virus and other 
fl
 aviviruses, we ruled out the hypothesis that the Brazilian Zika virus genome is a recombinant strain with other 
mosquito-borne fl
 aviviruses.
Interpretation These fi
 ndings strengthen the putative association between Zika virus and cases of microcephaly in 
neonates in Brazil. Moreover, our results suggest that the virus can cross the placental barrier. As a result, Zika virus 
should be considered as a potential infectious agent for human fetuses. Pathogenesis studies that confi
 rm the tropism 
of Zika virus for neuronal cells are warranted.

Introduction
Since 2015, Brazil has been facing a public health 
emergency regarding the dramatic increase in the 
number 
of 
newborn 
babies 
with 
microcephaly. 
Epidemiological data indicate that up to Jan 6, 2016, 
4783 cases were reported in 21 states in the North, 
Northeast, South, and Southeast Regions of Brazil.1 This 
incidence of microcephaly is 20 times higher than in 
previous years, reaching 99·7 per 100 000 livebirths, and 
including 76 deaths of neonates as of Jan 6, 2016.1
When diagnosed prenatally by ultrasound imaging, 
congenital microcephaly is a strong predictor of 
adverse neurological outcomes.2 As defi
 ned by WHO, 
microcephaly occurs whenever the occipital frontal 
circumference of the head of the newborn child or fetus 
is 2 standard deviations smaller than the mean for the 
same age and sex.3 A brain size that is signifi
 cantly 
diff
 erent to that in the normal range is an important risk 
factor for cognitive and motor delay.4 Microcephaly 
is associated with several causes, including genetic 
disorders 
(eg, 
autosomal 
recessive 
microcephaly, 
Aicardi-Goutières syndrome, chromosomal trisomy, 
Rett syndrome, and X-chromosomal microcephaly); 
drug and chemical intoxication of the pregnant mother 
(eg, use of alcohol, cocaine, or antiepileptic drugs, lead 
or mercury intoxication, or radiation); maternal mal-
nutrition; and transplacental infections with viruses or 
bacteria.5 Maternal viral infections, including rubella,

cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex, varicella zoster virus, 
HIV, and arboviruses such as chikungunya, have also 
been associated with microcephaly in neonates.5,6
Epidemiological evidence suggests that Zika virus 
infection of pregnant women in Brazil might be 
associated with the increasing numbers of congenital 
microcephaly cases reported in the country. Several 
mosquito species have been found to be naturally 
infected with Zika virus, including Aedes africanus, 
Aedes luteocephalus, Aedes hensilli, Aedes polynesiensis, 
Aedes dalzielii, Aedes albopictus, Aedes apicoargenteus, and 
Aedes aegypti among others, but little is known about 
their vector competence.7–10 A aegypti is the over-
whelmingly predominant mosquito species found in 
Brazil, and is also associated with other arboviruses 
already reported in Brazil, such as the dengue and 
chikungunya viruses.
Zika virus was fi
 rst isolated from human beings in 
Nigeria7 during studies undertaken in 1954. Further 
cases were reported in other African countries11 
(Uganda, Tanzania, Egypt, Sierra Leone, Gabon, 
Nigeria, Côte d’Ivoire, Cameroon, Senegal, and Central 
African Republic), in Asian countries (India, Pakistan, 
Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, 
and Indonesia), in several islands of the Pacifi
 c 
region since 2007 (Federated States of Micronesia, 
Cook Islands, French Polynesia, New Caledonia, Guam, 
Samoa, Vanuatu, and Solomon Islands), and since 
about early 2015 in the Americas (Chile, Colombia, 
El Salvador, Guatemala, Mexico, Paraguay, Suriname, 
Venezuela, Canada, and the USA).9–15 Outbreaks of 
Zika virus infection on Yap Island (in 2007) and in 
French Polynesia (2013–14), with further spread to 
New Caledonia, the Cook Islands, and Easter Island, 
have shown the propensity of this arbovirus species to 
spread outside its usual geographical range and to 
cause large outbreaks.
The fi
 rst autochthonous cases of Zika virus in Brazil 
were confi
 rmed in May, 2015.16 Since then, as of 
Jan 6, 2015, 21 states have confi
 rmed virus circulation, 
with a higher prevalence in the Northeast Region.17 
Reports 
of 
microcephaly 
incidence 
in 
Brazil 
geographically overlap with Zika virus reports; most of 
the mothers whose infants were diagnosed with micro-
cephaly complained during their pregnancies of clinical 
manifestations, such as low-grade fever, headache, and 
cutaneous rashes, that might have been symptoms of 
Zika virus infection or infection with any other arbovirus 
species that is prevalent in the region.
In the face of this potential association between 
Zika virus infection and the increasing number of cases 
of microcephaly, the Brazilian Ministry of Health and 
WHO have recommended that pregnant women should 
take precautions to avoid contact with all potential 
vectors, since no specifi
 c antiviral treatment for Zika 
virus infection exists.1
Small fragments of the genome of the Zika virus strain 
circulating in Brazil have been sequenced and 
phylogenetic analysis has indicated that the virus is 
similar to the one that circulated in French Polynesia in 
2013.16,17 However, evidence linking the high incidence of 
microcephaly to the presence of Zika virus is scarce. In 
January, 2016, our group reported ultrasound image 
evidence of two cases of fetal microcephaly in women 
who had complained of Zika-like virus symptoms during 
pregnancy, and we reported brief preliminary PCR 
fi
 ndings, confi
 rming the presence of Zika virus in their 
amniotic fl
 uid.18 In this case study, we expand upon these 
previously reported fi
 ndings, and describe how we used 
quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) and 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Many cases of microcephaly in newborn babies in Brazil have 
occurred in regions where infections of Zika virus and other 
arboviruses have also been detected. We searched PubMed with 
the search terms “Zika”, and “microcephaly” for articles published 
up to Feb 5, 2016. We found 11 articles that suggested a possible 
relation between Zika virus and microcephaly in neonates. A short 
case report by our group, reporting the ultrasound evidence of the 
two fetal microcephaly cases reported here, has been published 
previously. Our search found no other clear evidence that Zika 
virus could cross the placental barrier and infect the human fetus.
Added value of this study
This study presents the virological and genetic data implicating 
Zika virus in the two cases of fetal malformation that we 
described briefl
 y in our previous case report. We used 
quantitative reverse transcription PCR and viral metagenomics 
technology applied to samples of amniotic fl
 uid obtained from 
the two pregnant women carrying fetuses with microcephaly, 
and obtained sequences of the Zika virus genome. The study of 
these cases provides empirical evidence for the association 
between Zika virus infection during pregnancy and fetal 
microcephaly. Furthermore, we isolated the whole genome of 
Zika virus directly from the amniotic fl
 uid of two pregnant 
women, and provided evidence to support previous fi
 ndings 
indicating that the origin of the virus is French Polynesia.
Implications of all the available evidence
On the basis of our fi
 ndings, Zika virus should be regarded as a 
possible causative agent in cases of microcephaly, especially 
during Zika virus outbreaks in endemic regions. Our work 
emphasises not only the importance of controlling the 
Aedes aegypti mosquito population while no vaccine or antiviral 
is available, but also the need for further studies to understand 
the mechanisms of immunopathogenicity that lead to 
congenital malformation due to Zika virus infection.

Methods
Case histories
The fi
 rst case in our study was of a 27-year-old woman in 
her fi
 rst pregnancy, from an inner city in the state of 
Paraíba, in the Northeast Region of Brazil (patient 1). 
Her prenatal care was uneventful until early September, 
 
2015, when, at 18 weeks of gestation, the woman 
developed a cutaneous rash with itching of the hands 
and back. On the basis of her clinical status, she was 
diagnosed at an emergency service unit with allergic 
reaction, and was prescribed intravenous hydrocortisone. 
The next day, her symptoms worsened as she developed 
a fever and myalgia. She had a normal fetal ultrasound 
at 16 weeks. The patient had not travelled outside the 
state of Paraíba during the previous few years, and she 
had not had contact with any ill individuals. She had no 
immunodefi
 ciency or autoimmune diseases. At 21 weeks 
of gestation, a further ultrasound indicated a fetal 
microcephaly diagnosis with moderate ventriculomegaly 
and partial agenesis of the cerebellar vermis. A third 
ultrasound done at 27 weeks confi
 rmed the microcephaly 
diagnosis with relevant dilation of ventricles, asymmetry 
of hemispheres, and hypoplastic cerebellum with 
complete absence of the cerebellar vermis. The patient 
was healthy and stable during the ultrasound and 
amniocentesis procedures. Results of all laboratory 
examinations showed no diabetes and blood-pressure-
related disorders. Additionally, the patient did not report 
taking any medication (other than hydrocortisone), 
recreational drug use, alcohol consumption, or smoking 
during the pregnancy. Patient 1 is still being monitored 
by the physicians in our group. At 40 weeks of gestation 
the fetus presented microcephaly with calcifi
 cation 
areas and head circumference of 29 cm assessed by 
ultrasonography before birth. The baby was born at 
40 weeks of gestation and had an actual head 
circumference of 30 cm.
The second case in our study was of a 35-year-old 
woman in her fi
 rst pregnancy, also from the state of 
Paraíba (patient 2). The patient, with no relevant past 
medical history, sought care when she developed mild 
Zika virus disease-like symptoms at 10 weeks of gestation. 
She was prescribed symptomatic treatment. A morph-
ological ultrasound at 22 weeks of gestation revealed 
mild hypoplasia of the cerebellar vermis. The fetal head 
circumference on the 22nd week of gestation was below 
the 10th percentile. A second ultrasound done at 25 weeks 
of gestation revealed more severe hypoplasia of the 
cerebellar vermis, enlargement of the posterior fossa, 
and microcephaly, yielding a head circumference below 
the third percentile. The brain parenchyma was normal. 
The patient was healthy and stable during the ultrasound 
and amniocentesis procedures. All the laboratory 
examinations showed no evidence of diabetes or 
blood-pressure-related disorders. Additionally, she did 
not report taking any medication, recreational drug use, 
alcohol consumption, or smoking during the pregnancy. 
Patient 2 is still being monitored by the physicians in 
our group. She delivered on Feb 3, 2016, and the neonate 
presented severe ventriculomegaly, microphthalmia, 
cataract, and severe arthrogryposis in the legs and arms.
Sample collection
Following Brazilian health public recommendations, 
amniocentesis was done at gestational week 28 in both 
women to investigate the cause of microcephaly. 
Ultrasound-guided transabdominal amniocentesis was 
done and about 5 mL of amniotic fl
 uid was aspirated and 
immediately stored at –80°C.
Viral metagenomics and sequence analysis
A 0·5 mL sample of the amniotic fl
 uid from each patient 
was fi
 ltered through 0·45 μm fi
 lters to remove residual 
host cells. The samples were then centrifuged at 
21 130 × g and 15 000 rpm (rotor FA-45–24–11, Eppendorf, 
Hamburg, Germany) for 90 min at 4°C to concentrate 
virus particles. Pelleted virus particles were treated with 
deoxy 
ribonuclease and ribonuclease A at 37°C for 
90 min according to previously reported protocols.19 
RNA was isolated using the QIAamp MinElute Virus 
Spin Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), omitting carrier 
RNA. Double-stranded cDNA libraries were prepared 
using the TruSeq Stranded Total RNA LT Sample 
Preparation Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Library 
size distribution was assessed using the 2100 Bioanalyzer 
(Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and the High Sensitivity 
DNA Kit (Agilent). Accurate quanti 
fi
 cation of the 
libraries was accomplished with the 7500 Real-Time 
PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, 
USA) and the KAPA Library Quantifi
 cation Kit 
(Kapa Biosystems, Wilmington, MA, USA). Paired-end 
sequencing (2 × 210 bp) was done using a MiSeq 
sequencing system (Illumina).
The sequences obtained were preprocessed using the 
PRINSEQ software to remove reads smaller than 35 bp 
and sequences with scores of lower quality than a 
Phred quality score of 20. Fast length adjustment of 
short reads (FLASH) software was used to merge and 
extend the paired-end Illumina reads using the default 
parameters, with a maximum overlap of 400 bp. 
The extended reads were analysed with basic local 
alignment search tool (BLAST), against the Human 
Transcriptome Database (RefSeq, Annotation Release 
107; 162 916 sequences), with e-value cutoff
  of 1e-5, to 
remove human RNA sequences. Non-human reads 
were analysed against all GenBank viral genomes 
(65 052 sequences), and reads that were similar to the 
Zika virus were collected and used for genomic 
assembly. The Zika virus genome (Brazil strain) was 
assembled de novo using the CAP3 assembly software,

using the parameters overlap length cutoff
  (-o) of 16, 
and overlap percent identity cutoff
  (-p) of 85. The Atlas 
genome was constructed using BRIG (BLAST Ring 
Image Generator) software. We used the Zika virus 
genome sequence H/PF/2013 (KJ776791.1) as the 
reference. This strain was isolated in French Polynesia, 
and we compared it with a strain from Uganda, MR 
766 (accession: NC_012532.1), another strain isolated 
in Senegal, ArD157995 (accession: KF383118), and our 
assembled Zika virus genome.
Phylogenetic analysis
Phylogenetic reconstruction was completed using both 
maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference methods 
on alignments of the envelope and NS5 regions of the 
polyprotein coding sequence. The best choice of 
substitution model used in the maximum likelihood and 
Bayesian inference analyses was determined with the 
likelihood-ratio test, implemented using HyPhy software. 
The generalised time-reversible (GTR) model with 
gamma-distributed evolutionary rates (G) and invariable 
sites (I), GTR + G + I, was chosen. We undertook 
maximum likelihood analysis with PhyML 3.0 phylogeny 
software, using the approximate likelihood-ratio test as a 
means of assigning statistical signifi
 cance to internal 
branches. Bayesian inference was run on MrBayes 3.2 
software with default Markov chain Monte Carlo 
(MCMC) algorithm settings—ie, two independent runs 
with four chains each were sampled every 500th 
generation until 1 000 000 samples were obtained. 25% of 
the MCMC samples were discarded as a burn-in step. 
Chain convergence was measured by the Gelman-Rubin 
statistic, using the potential scale reduction factor, or 
PSRF, which was close to 1 for all parameters. Maximum 
likelihood and Bayesian inference topologies were 
identical. We therefore report the results from the 
maximum likelihood analysis.
To investigate recombination breakpoints along the 
Zika virus genome, a sliding window strategy was 
implemented using an in-house script. By building a 
stand-alone BLAST database containing all reference 
fl
 avivirus genomes, we scanned the Zika virus genome 
every 50 bp regions and registered their BLAST hits 
using a cutoff
  e-value of 0·0001. We did genome-wide 
multiple alignments using the Multi-LAGAN algorithm 
as implemented in the VISTA database. Phylogeny of 
whole genomes was also inferred by maximum 
likelihood and Bayesian inference methods.

Results
Serum, urine, and amniotic fl
 uid samples from both 
patients (all taken at week 28 of gestation) were tested for 
dengue virus, chikungunya virus, and Zika virus. The RT-
qPCR for dengue virus20 and the RT-qPCR for chikungunya 
virus21 were negative in all samples. The RT-qPCRs for 
Zika virus22 confi
 rmed Zika virus infection in the amniotic 
fl
 uids of patients 1 and 2, but were negative in urine and 
serum samples in both patients. Serology tests of serum, 
urine, and amniotic fl
 uid samples using anti-dengue-
virus IgM, anti-dengue-virus IgG, anti-chikungunya-virus 
IgM, and anti-chikungunya-virus IgG yielded negative 
results by ELISA. However, ELISA for Zika virus was 
positive for anti-Zika-virus IgM in amniotic fl
 uid, and 
negative in serum and urine in both patients 1 and 2. 
TORCH (toxoplasmosis, HIV, syphilis, measles, rubella, 
cytomegalovirus, and herpes simplex) panels of both 
women were also negative, as well as specifi
 c HIV, 
syphilis, cyto 
megalovirus, and parvovirus B19 screens.
Virus particles were fi
 ltrated and concentrated from the 
amniotic fl
 uid samples. After cellular contaminants and 
human sequences were eliminated, 288 904 sequences

its genomic identity with the Zika virus sequence 
KJ776791.1 isolated in French Polynesia. The comparison 
with African strains such as NC_012532.1 (Zika virus 
Uganda) and KF383118.1 (Zika virus Senegal) yielded 
87–90% identity. The proportion of GC content in the 
Brazilian Zika virus was 51·2% (fi
 gure 1).
We compared the viral sequences from patient 1 with 
previously released sequence data from Zika virus 
outbreaks in Asia and Africa and other fl
 aviviruses, 
including dengue virus serotypes 1–4, West Nile virus, 
and yellow fever virus. Phylogenetic analyses were done 
using the coding region for the envelope (fi
 gure 2) and 
NS5 genes (fi
 gure 3). The geographical origin of the 
Brazilian Zika virus strain could not be determined 
because of sampling limitations, but Brazilian Zika virus 
is probably more closely related to French Polynesia 
sequences than to African strains. Maximum likelihood 
and Bayesian inference methods applied to the alignment 
of the envelope and NS5 regions of the polyprotein 
coding 
sequence 
yielded 
identical 
estimates 
of 
phylogenetic topologies. In both envelope (fi
 gure 2) and 
NS5 (fi
 gure 3) genomic regions, the new genome

clustered with sequences from North and South America, 
southeast Asia, and the Pacifi
 c.
The geographical and chronological distributions of 
Zika virus lineages also indicate that southeast Asian 
strains could have remained genetically isolated from 
African strains for about 50 years, because Malaysian 
sequence HQ234449, collected in 1966, is the sister group 
of the remaining New World and Pacifi
 c strains. This 
pattern was further confi
 rmed by the genomic distance 
between the newly sequenced Brazilian Zika virus and 
the Ugandan Zika virus genome available in GenBank 
(ZIKV LC002520; fi
 gure 4).
We assessed the possibility of recombination events 
between the Zika virus and other fl
 aviviruses by scanning 
the Zika virus genome every 50 bp using as references the 
genomes from dengue virus serotypes 1–4, West Nile 
virus, yellow fever virus, and chikungunya virus (an 
alphavirus that is transmitted by the same vector). The 
sliding window strategy with local alignments of genomic 
fragments ruled out the hypothesis that the newly 
sequenced Brazilian Zika virus genome is a recombinant 
strain with other mosquito-borne fl
 aviviruses. All genomic 
regions consistently presented best hits and signifi
 cant 
e-values with previously reported Zika virus genomes, 
ruling out the hypothesis of genomic recombination.
Discussion
Detection of the Zika virus genome and anti-Zika-virus 
IgM in the amniotic fl
 uid of pregnant women with 
microcephalic fetuses has not been previously reported in 
detail in the scientifi
 c literature. This fi
 nding shows that 
the Zika virus can cross the placental barrier and, possibly, 
infect the fetus. A previous report23 suggested that 
fragments of Zika virus genome were identifi
 ed in saliva, 
breastmilk, urine, and serum of two mothers and their 
newborn babies within 4 days of delivery. However, our 
group is the fi
 rst, to our knowledge, to isolate the whole 
genome of Zika virus directly from the amniotic fl
 uid of a 
pregnant woman before delivery, supporting the 
hypothesis that Zika virus infection could occur through 
transplacental transmission.
Some neglected tropical diseases have well known 
neurological eff
 ects. Many distinct clinical syndromes, 
from mild fever and arthralgia to severe haemorrhagic 
and encephalitic manifestations, are known to be 
associated with fl
 avivirus infections.24 Other severe 
neurological complications such as Guillain-Barré 
syndrome have been reported in patients infected with 
Zika virus.25 Two key properties allow these viruses to 
aff
 ect the neural system: the ability to enter the CNS 
(neuroinvasiveness) and the capacity to infect neural cells 
through a process known as neurovirulence. A connection 
between Zika virus infections and poor CNS outcomes 
remains presumptive, and is based on a temporal 
association. New studies should be done to investigate 
whether the Zika virus can infect either neurological 
precursor cells or fi
 nal diff
 erentiated cells.
Congenital microcephaly is a descriptive diagnosis. It 
can be caused by various factors, such as genetic disorders, 
exposure to chemicals, brain injury, con 
sumption of 
teratogenic drugs, and intrauterine infections.26 Here, we 
focused on viral infection to explain these two cases of 
microcephaly. However, other possible causes or 
contributing factors should continue to be pursued as new 
cases arise in Brazil.
In these two patients, fetal microcephaly was detected 
early during gestation and a severe outcome was 
expected. Ultrasound tests revealed the presence of 
malformation, including ventriculomegaly and cerebellar 
hypoplasia. Fetal brain malformation can often result 
from viral infections during pregnancy. Cytomegalovirus 
infection occurring before 18 weeks of gestation is 
frequently associated with lissencephaly with a thin 
cerebral cortex, cerebellar hypoplasia, and ventriculo-
megaly, among other malformations.27 However, in the 
two cases presented here, serological and RT-PCR tests 
for 
cytomegalovirus 
were 
negative, 
ruling 
out 
cytomegalovirus infection. The viral metagenomic 
approach used here does not exclude either DNA or RNA 
viruses; nevertheless, no cytomegalovirus sequence was 
identifi
 ed in the amniotic fl
 uid in our analyses. An 
increase in the incidence of CNS malformations in 
fetuses and neonates was reported after a Zika virus 
outbreak in French Polynesia; however, the occurrence of

microcephaly associated with these previous outbreaks 
was not documented.1
Our previous image fi
 ndings18 and our results shown 
here of the presence of viral genomic material in both 
patients, several weeks after the acute phase of Zika virus 
disease, suggest that the intrauterine viral load results 
from persistent replication. In turn, this persistence 
could be partly explained by the reduced immune system 
response of the fetus, as described in the pathogenesis of 
congenital cytomegalovirus.28,29
The Zika virus could have undergone several recom-
bination events, and the recurrent loss and gain of the 
N-linked glycosylation site in the E protein could be 
related to mosquito-cell infectivity.30 We found no 
evidence of recombination events in the Zika virus 
genomes that we tested. The role of recombination in 
Zika virus virulence warrants further study.
Our results provide insight into the origin of the Zika 
virus circulating in Brazil, and suggest that a causal 
relation might exist between Zika virus infection and 
fetal microcephaly. New studies coordinated by the 
Brazilian Ministry of Health and other institutions are 
underway to further test this hypothesis, and hopefully 
elucidate the cellular and molecular mechanisms of 
Zika virus infection.
We recommend that Zika virus infection should be 
regarded as a possible causative agent in cases of 
microcephaly, especially during Zika virus outbreaks in 
endemic regions. Early diagnosis of Zika virus infection, 
supportive care, symptomatic treatment, and referral of 
children with microcephaly to specialised care are all 
necessary measures to improve neurodevelopment of 
aff
 ected children.
