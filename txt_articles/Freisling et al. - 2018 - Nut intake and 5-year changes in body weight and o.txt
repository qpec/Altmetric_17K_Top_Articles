Abstract  
1 
Purpose   There is inconsistent evidence regarding the relationship between higher intake of 
2 
nuts, being an energy-dense food, and weight gain. We investigated the relationship between nut 
3 
intake and changes in weight over 5 years. 
4 
Methods   This study includes 373,293 men and women, 25-70 years old, recruited between 
5 
1992 and 2000 from 10 European countries in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and 
6 
Nutrition (EPIC) study. Habitual intake of nuts including peanuts, together defined as nut intake, was 
7 
estimated from country-specific validated dietary questionnaires. Body weight was measured at 
8 
recruitment and self-reported 5 years later. The association between nut intake and body weight 
9 
change was estimated using multilevel mixed linear regression models with center/country as random 
10 
effect and nut intake and relevant confounders as fixed effects. The relative risk (RR) of becoming 
11 
overweight or obese after 5 years was investigated using multivariate Poisson regressions stratified 
12 
according to baseline body mass index (BMI). 
13 
Results   On average, study participants gained 2.1 kg (SD 5.0 kg) over 5 years. Compared to 
14 
non-consumers, subjects in the highest quartile of nut intake had less weight gain over 5 years (−0.07 
15 
kg; 95% CI, −0.12- −0.02) (P-trend=0.025) and had 5% lower risk of becoming overweight (RR, 0.95; 
16 
95% CI, 0.92-0.98) or obese (RR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.90-0.99) (both P-trend <0.008). 
17 
Conclusions   Higher intake of nuts is associated with reduced weight gain and a lower risk of 
18 
becoming overweight or obese.

Introduction 
21 
Observational studies and clinical trials, including the recent PREDIMED trial [1], have provided 
22 
evidence that high nut consumption has beneficial effects on the occurrence of chronic diseases such 
23 
as cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes [2–5], and a possible role in cancer prevention [5–8].  
24 
Nuts can provide 160–200 kcal per serving (30 g) and thus have energy-density similar to 
25 
foods such as crackers, chocolate candies, and cookies. Therefore, concerns persist that high nut intake 
26 
may lead to weight gain and increased long-term risk of obesity [9]. Whether frequent nut 
27 
consumption promotes weight gain is not yet conclusive. Weight gain may not occur if nuts are 
28 
incorporated into an isocaloric diet in which they are substitute for other foods such as red meat or 
29 
processed meat or refined carbohydrates, as opposed to being added to an existing diet [10].  
30 
Randomized nut-feeding trials showed that compared with control diets, isocaloric diets 
31 
enriched with nuts did not increase body weight, body mass index (BMI), or waist circumference [11, 
32 
12]. However, these trials were limited by small numbers of volunteers, consuming a controlled diet 
33 
over relatively short periods, with one notable exception, where median follow-up time was 4.8 years 
34 
[12], and were not primarily designed to evaluate body weight changes. In addition, such trials are 
35 
expensive to conduct across populations and may not test real-life settings.  
36 
There are little existing data from prospective observational studies [13–17], and these are 
37 
limited because they were based on homogeneous populations and with one exception [14], did not 
38 
account for overall dietary patterns. Dietary patterns may confound findings associated with nut intake 
39 
because individuals who eat higher quantities of nuts usually also have a better overall diet quality 
40 
[18], and other favourable lifestyle habits such as higher physical activity levels. Thus, it is important 
41 
to account for dietary quality and other lifestyle behaviours in prospective observational settings. 
42 
We propose to address these knowledge gaps utilizing data of the EPIC-PANACEA study; 
43 
PANACEA (Physical Activity, Nutrition, Alcohol, Cessation of smoking, Eating out of home in 
44 
relation to Anthropometry) is the sub-cohort of the EPIC (European Prospective Investigation into 
45 
Cancer and nutrition) study, where repeated assessments of weight are available making it possible to 
46 
study weight changes. 
47 
 7 
The main objective of the present study was to investigate the relationship between nut intake and 
48 
subsequent changes in weight after an average of 5 years of follow-up accounting for dietary patterns 
49 
and other lifestyle factors that may co-vary with nut intake. A secondary objective was to estimate 
50 
risks of becoming overweight or obese associated with higher nut intake. 
51 
 
52 
Methods 
53 
Study population.  
54 
The EPIC study is an ongoing prospective cohort study across 23 centers in 10 European countries: 
55 
Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, and the United 
56 
Kingdom (UK). The cohort of 521,448 men and women recruited from 1992 to 2000 (age range: 25 to 
57 
70 years) was enrolled from the general population with exceptions for France (national health 
58 
insurance scheme members), Utrecht and Florence (breast cancer screening participants), Oxford 
59 
(health conscious, mainly vegetarian, volunteers), and some centres from Italy and Spain (blood 
60 
donors). The rationale for EPIC, study design, and methods have been described in detail elsewhere 
61 
[19, 20]. The EPIC study was approved by the Ethical Review Board of the IARC and the Institutional 
62 
Review Board of each participating EPIC centers. 
63 
For the present study, we excluded pregnant women, participants with missing dietary or 
64 
lifestyle information, missing data on weight and height or with implausible anthropometric values at 
65 
baseline (n=23,713). We further excluded 122,154 individuals with missing weight at follow-up and 
66 
2,288 individuals with outlying anthropometry at follow-up: weight change < −5 or > 5 kg/year and 
67 
BMI at follow-up < 16 kg/m2. More details on follow-up exclusions are given in Figure S1 (Online 
68 
Resource) and have been previously detailed [21, 22]. The final analyses included 103,303 men and 
69 
269,990 women with complete and plausible body weight data.  
70 
 
71 
Anthropometric measures and weight change.  
72 
Two body weight measures were available for each participant: at baseline and after a median follow-
73 
up time of 5 years (min.: 2 years for Heidelberg (Germany); max.: 11 years for Varese (Italy)). At 
74 
baseline, body weight and height were measured in most centres using comparable, standardized 
75 
 8 
procedures with the exception of those taken in France, Norway and the health conscious group of the 
76 
Oxford centre in which subjects self-reported their weight. As for the follow-up weight assessments, 
77 
all values were self-reported, except in Norfolk (UK) and Doetinchem (The Netherlands) where 
78 
weight was measured [21, 22]. The accuracy of self-reported anthropometric measures – at baseline 
79 
and at follow-up – was improved with the use of prediction equations derived from subjects with both 
80 
measured and self-reported weight at baseline [23]. Our main outcome was weight change in kg per 5 
81 
years, calculated as weight at follow-up − weight at baseline divided by the follow-up time in years 
82 
and multiplied by 5 years.  
83 
 
84 
Dietary assessment.  
85 
Habitual food consumption during the previous 12 months was assessed at baseline for each individual 
86 
with center-specific methods; in most cases food-frequency questionnaires (FFQs) [20]. These 
87 
questionnaires were developed and validated in each country/center to capture country-specific dietary 
88 
habits. In most centers FFQs were self-administered, with the exception of Greece, Ragusa (Italy), 
89 
Naples (Italy) and Spain where face-to-face interviews were performed. Extensive quantitative FFQs 
90 
were used in northern Italy, the Netherlands, Germany and Greece. Questionnaires structured by meals 
91 
were used in Spain, France and Ragusa (Italy). Semi-quantitative FFQs were used in Denmark, 
92 
Norway, Naples (Italy) and Umea (Sweden). In the UK, both a semi-quantitative FFQ and a 7-day 
93 
record were used, whereas a method combining a FFQ with a 7-day record on lunch and dinner was 
94 
used in Malmö (Sweden) [20]. Details of the questionnaire items regarding nut intake for each center 
95 
or country, have been described previously [8]. In brief, the respective questionnaire food item(s) in 
96 
France, Germany, Greece, Ragusa (Italy), the Netherlands, Spain, and the UK asked non-specifically 
97 
for intake of any kind of nuts incl. peanuts; in Denmark and Norway specifically for peanuts, and in 
98 
Umea (Sweden) specifically for “peanuts, salted”; in northern Italy specifically for “walnuts, 
99 
hazelnuts, almonds, and peanuts”, and in Naples (Italy) for “walnuts”; in Spain for an exhaustive list 
100 
of different types of nuts incl. peanuts and seeds; in Malmö (Sweden), the FFQ included peanuts as 
101 
snacks, whereas other nuts had to be added to an open-ended question or recorded at lunch and dinner 
102 
meals; finally, in Germany, the Netherlands, and the UK separate items on peanut butter intake were 
103 
 9 
asked for and we included this item in our overall nut intake variable. Here we define the combined 
104 
intake of any of the items described above as “nut intake”; because nut intake was assessed in these 
105 
broad categories, a stratified analysis by specific types of nuts was not possible. Non-consumers were 
106 
determined from the FFQs and defined as those with an intake of nuts equal to zero.  
107 
In order to account for healthy diet, which may confound nut intake, we used the modified 
108 
relative Mediterranean Diet Score (mrMDS) [24]. This score included the nutritional components that 
109 
characterize the Mediterranean diet: i.e. higher intake of vegetables, legumes, fruit and nuts, cereals, 
110 
fish and seafood, plant oils, and moderate alcohol consumption; and lower intakes of meat/products, 
111 
and dairy products. Each mrMDS component (apart from alcohol) was measured in grams per 1000 
112 
kcal (to express intake as energy density) and higher scores (range: 0-18) characterizing a 
113 
Mediterranean diet [24]. In order to avoid over-adjustment, we used the mrMDS after subtracting the 
114 
“fruit and nuts” component. 
115 
 
116 
Assessment of other covariates.  
117 
Data on objectively validated physical activity [25], smoking status, and education were collected at 
118 
baseline through questionnaires [20]. Information on smoking status was also collected at follow-up at 
119 
the same time as anthropometric data collection. Thus, we could account for smoking status 
120 
modification during follow-up (stable current smoker, stable former smoker, stable never smoker, quit 
121 
smoking, started smoking).  
122 
 
123 
Statistical analyses.  
124 
Habitual nut intake as estimated from the dietary questionnaires was analysed both on a continuous 
125 
scale per 15 g/day increment, which corresponds to the mean intake of nut consumers in the highest 
126 
cohort category of intake, and by categories with all non-consumers (~25%) placed in the first 
127 
(reference) category and the consumers divided by quartiles into the remaining four categories of 
128 
intake (categories 2 to 5), similar as in Jenab et al. [8]. As a secondary analysis, we also modelled 
129 
frequency of nut intake using the following categories: “never/almost never”, “0.5-2 times/month”, 
130 
“0.5-≤1 times/week”, “more than 1 times/week”, which is similar to Bes-Rastrollo et al.[14]. 
131 
 10 
Frequency data for the centers Cambridge (UK) (n=14,535) and Malmö (Sweden) (n=21,566) were 
132 
not available because open-ended dietary methodologies were used. 
133 
The association between nut intake and body weight change (kg/5 years) was estimated using 
134 
multilevel mixed linear regression models with center as random effect and nut intake and relevant 
135 
confounders as fixed effects. Models with three different sets of adjustment were fit (see footnotes of 
136 
Table 2 for complete list). Participants with missing values for physical activity (1.5%), education 
137 
(2.1%), and smoking status at follow-up (0.4% after replacing missing values at follow-up [10.5%] by 
138 
smoking status at baseline) were classified as a separate category and included in the models. Model 
139 
assumptions and fit were checked visually by plotting the residuals against each of the categorical 
140 
covariates. The linearity of the associations for each continuous covariate was evaluated by three-knot 
141 
restricted cubic spline models at Harrell’s default percentiles (i.e. 10th, 50th, and 90th) in combination 
142 
with a Wald-type test [26]. Because baseline BMI and follow-up time in years (both P non-linear < 
143 
0.001) showed a non-linear relationship with weight change, splines with 3 knots for these two 
144 
variables were included as covariates. 
145 
In order to evaluate heterogeneity across countries/centers, we performed country/center-
146 
specific analyses using generalized linear models and pooled results by random-effect meta-analysis 
147 
and calculated I squared and respective P values for heterogeneity [27].  
148 
We performed a range of sensitivity analyses such as excluding participants with chronic 
149 
diseases at baseline or missing values in covariates, excluding countries where nut intake included 
150 
peanuts only or adjusting for main food groups instead of the mrMDS (Table S1, Online Resource).  
151 
We tested a priori for effect modification by age (categorised as younger than median age <51 
152 
and ≥ 51 years), sex, BMI categories at baseline (<25, 25-≤30, >30kg/m2), and change of smoking 
153 
status (never, current, start smoking, quitter, former) by including interaction terms between each 
154 
variable and nut intake (continuous per 15 g/d) in the models. P values for the interaction term were 
155 
calculated by using F tests. 
156 
We used a modified Poisson regression approach [28] to estimate the relative risks (RR) and 
157 
95% confidence intervals (CI) of becoming overweight or obese according to nut intake (in categories 
158 
of absolute intakes and frequency of intake). Analyses were stratified by initial BMI categories (<25: 
159 
 11 
normal weight, 25≤BMI<30: overweight and ≥30 kg/m2: obese). RRs were adjusted as in our model 3 
160 
described above. The BMI after 5 years was calculated from the 5 year follow-up weight and baseline 
161 
height. 
162 
Differences were considered statistically significant at P <0.05. All statistical analyses were 
163 
performed with STATA 12.1 (College Station TX). 
164 
 
165 
Results 
166 
The main characteristics of the study population at baseline by categories of nut intake are shown in 
167 
Table 1. Higher intake of nuts was associated with younger age, a lower BMI, a higher educational 
168 
level, never smoking, and being more physically active. Participants in the highest category of nut 
169 
intake also had higher intakes of vegetables, fruit, cereals/cereal products, non-alcoholic and alcoholic 
170 
beverages, but also of sugar/confectionary, and cakes/biscuits; they also had a slightly higher mrMED 
171 
score. In contrast, they had lower intakes of meat/products, dairy, fish, and potatoes. On average, study 
172 
participants gained 2.1 kg of weight between baseline and the 2nd weight assessment with considerable 
173 
variation between subjects (SD 5.0 kg). 
174 
Body weight changes (kg) over 5 years according to baseline nut intake are shown in Table 2. 
175 
After adjustment for potential confounders, each 15g/day increase in nut intake was associated with 
176 
less weight gain (−0.04 kg/5-years, 95% CI, −0.071- −0.012). The observed effects were small and 
177 
corresponded to ~2.5%-reduction in body weight increase. Associations remained virtually unchanged 
178 
after further adjustment for Mediterranean diet using the mrMDS (Model 3, Table 2). Estimated 
179 
results were consistent across countries/centers with low heterogeneity (I-squared=21%, P 
180 
heterogeneity = 0.22) (Figure S2, Online Resource). Analyses by categories of nut intake confirmed 
181 
the findings using intake on a continuous scale, where participants in the highest category of nut intake 
182 
gained 0.07 kg/5-years less weight as compared to non-consumers (P trend = 0.025) (Table 2). 
183 
Furthermore, when we analyzed frequency of nut intake without accounting for amounts of intake, 
184 
strengths of associations increased, where subjects consuming nuts more than once per week gained 
185 
0.1 kg/5-years less weight as compared to non-consumers (P trend < 0.001) (Table 2).  
186 
 12 
Our main findings were also robust to a range of sensitivity analyses (Table S1, Online 
187 
Resource). For example, excluding participants who started or quit smoking during follow-up (Model 
188 
S4), with missing values in any of the covariates (Model S8), , or in non-smokers only (to exclude 
189 
residual confounding in smokers) (Model S16) resulted in virtually similar effect estimates. Similarly, 
190 
excluding participants from Denmark, Norway, and Umea (Sweden), where the country/center-
191 
specific FFQ only included peanuts, did not alter the estimates (Model S9). In contrast, when we 
192 
excluded France (Model S11), where the FFQ item on nuts was asked only in relation to “aperitif” 
193 
before lunch or dinner, which in France is typically consumed with an alcoholic beverage, effect 
194 
estimates per 15g/day nut intake doubled from −0.042 (95% CI, −0.071-−0.012) to −0.083 kg/5-years 
195 
(95% CI, −0.114- −0.051). Another important finding in our sensitivity analysis was that adjustment 
196 
for main food groups as indicated in Table 1, instead of the mrMDS, resulted in similar effect 
197 
estimates (Model S12), but only when intake of meat/products was excluded. Inclusion of intake of 
198 
meat/products completely attenuated associations between intake of nuts and peanuts (15g/day) and 5-
199 
y weight change (0.004 kg/5-y; 95% CI, −0.027- 0.034) (Model S13).

No effect modification was found with regard to baseline age (P interaction = 0.54), sex (P 
201 
interaction = 0.62), baseline weight status (P interaction = 0.18) or change in smoking status (P 
202 
interaction = 0.95). 
203 
Adjusted relative risks (95% CI) of becoming overweight or obese after 5 years according to 
204 
categories of nut intake and initial BMI are presented in Table 3. At baseline, 197,291 subjects were 
205 
normal weight, 127,445 were overweight and 48,557 were obese. After 5 years, 31,215 (15.8%) 
206 
normal weight subjects became overweight or obese and 14,913 (13.2%) overweight subjects became 
207 
obese. Compared to non-consumers of nuts, normal weight subjects at baseline in the highest category 
208 
of nut intake had a 5% (95% CI, 2%-8%) lower risk of becoming overweight or obese. Similarly, 
209 
overweight subjects at baseline had a 5% (95% CI, 1%-10%) lower risk of becoming obese. 
210 
Frequency of nut intake was also associated with 5% (95% CI, 1%-10%) lower risk of becoming 
211 
overweight or obese in subjects that were normal weight at baseline. However, no association was 
212 
observed for risk of becoming obese in subjects that were already overweight at baseline (P trend = 
213 
0.39).

Discussion 
215 
Gradual age-related body weight increase during adulthood is a well observed phenomenon in many 
216 
non-obese populations — in our study, about 0.4 kg per year. Using baseline and follow-up data from 
217 
a large European multi-center cohort study, EPIC-PANACEA, we found that long-term weight gain 
218 
was significantly less in individuals consuming higher levels of nuts. These inverse associations were 
219 
modest for absolute intake of nuts, but were more pronounced for the frequency of consumption – 
220 
possibly reflecting different dietary habits or difficulties in reporting portion size accurately – where 
221 
>1 serving of nuts per week was associated with a 10% lower body weight increase. Importantly, our 
222 
findings are not likely to be confounded by a better overall diet quality, which is often observed in 
223 
high consumers of nuts, because we adjusted for dietary patterns and other lifestyle factors notably 
224 
physical activity and smoking. 
225 
In a post hoc analysis, we found that habitual high intake of meat and processed meat appears 
226 
to attenuate associations. We believe that the observed effects of nut intake on body weight change are 
227 
at least partly mediated via a reduced intake of meat/products shown to be positively associated with 
228 
weight gain [22, 29]. This has been hypothesized earlier as being one of the potential pathways of 
229 
weight stabilizing effects of nuts [10] and confirmed in our sensitivity analysis (Table S1, Online 
230 
Resource).  
231 
Our findings are in line with the few other prospective observational studies [13–17]. Women 
232 
in the Nurses’ Health Study II (NHS II), who reported eating nuts ≥2 times/wk, experienced 0.5 kg 
233 
less weight gain (95% CI, −0.8- −0.2) after a mean 8 years of follow-up compared with those who 
234 
rarely ate nuts [14]. Similar results were observed in the Seguimiento Universidad de Navarra (SUN) 
235 
study, a prospective cohort in Spain, where weight change in men and women was assessed after a 
236 
median of 28 months [13] and after 6 years [16]. In the Nurses’ Health Study (NHS), no differences in 
237 
weight gain over 16 years of follow-up across categories of nut consumption were observed [15]. A 
238 
pooled analysis of the NHS, the NHS II, and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, where the 
239 
relationship of dietary changes over 4-year periods was related to changes in body weight, found that 
240 
per serving increase in nut intake, study participants gained 0.57 lb (~0.3 kg) less weight per 4-year 
241 
period [17]. The observed differences in effect sizes across these studies can most likely be explained 
242 
 14 
by a combination of factors including differences in length of weight follow-up, confounder 
243 
adjustment, accuracy of dietary assessment instruments used, but also differences in terms of 
244 
frequency and amount of consumed nuts, underlying dietary habits and other lifestyle factors that are 
245 
specific to a population. Interestingly, the only randomized controlled nut-feeding trial (PREDIMED) 
246 
that had a comparably long follow-up as in our study reported very similar results with regard to 
247 
adjusted difference in 5 year changes in bodyweight in the nut group as compared with the control 
248 
group (−0.08 kg) though not statistically significant (95% CI, −0.50-0.35 kg) and only in the context 
249 
of a Mediterranean diet [12]. We specifically accounted for Mediterranean dietary patterns in our 
250 
analysis in order to evaluate associations of nut intake with weight change in the context of other diets. 
251 
Romaguera et al. showed previously in the same study population that high adherence to a 
252 
Mediterranean diet was associated with a 5-year weight change of −0.16 kg (95% CI, −0.24- −0.07 kg) 
253 
and were 10% (95% CI, 4%-18%) less likely to develop overweight or obesity compared to 
254 
individuals with a low adherence [30]. 
255 
Several mechanistic hypotheses have been proposed that could explain the association 
256 
between nut consumption and lessened weight gain, despite a potentially higher total energy intake in 
257 
nut consumers [10, 31]. These include increased satiety/supressed hunger due to the high dietary fibre 
258 
and plant protein content of nuts; the high content of unsaturated fat, which together with the high 
259 
protein content can lead to an increase in resting energy expenditure and diet-induced thermogenesis, 
260 
both of which can reduce body weight and weight gain; and incomplete mastication of nuts may cause 
261 
a low level of fat absorption that could result in the loss of available energy [10, 31]. In addition, 
262 
individuals who consume nuts regularly tend to consume less red and processed meat [10]. As already 
263 
mentioned above, such a replacement is likely to be beneficial for the prevention of weight gain 
264 
because red and processed meat intake have been associated with weight gain, risk of obesity and 
265 
higher BMI [17, 22, 29]. 
266 
Our study has limitations. First, only self-reported weight at follow-up was available in most 
267 
centers. To mitigate this potential source of bias, we used a prediction equation to improve self-
268 
reported weight estimates [23]. Furthermore, in the EPIC-Norfolk study, a sub-cohort of EPIC, a high 
269 
correlation between self-reported and measured weight data has been shown (r=0.97 in men and 
270 
 15 
r=0.98 in women), which means that ranking of participants according to self-reported weight was 
271 
adequate [32]. Second, we were not able to accurately measure changes in body composition (e.g., 
272 
using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, DXA); therefore we had to assume that observed weight 
273 
changes are largely due to changes in body fat mass and not in lean body mass. Third, we were not 
274 
able to account for potential changes in diet during follow-up; yet, magnitudes of changes in weight 
275 
appear to be more pronounced and more robust if changes in diet can be accounted for [33]. 
276 
Nevertheless, mean dietary changes at the population level are often small; for example, in the NHS, 
277 
the mean 4-year change in nut intake corresponded to a 5% increase of the baseline intake [17]. 
278 
Fourth, we were not able to stratify our analysis by specific types of nuts because nut intake was 
279 
assessed in broad categories of nut intake across the EPIC centers/countries. Finally, measurement 
280 
error is a limitation inherent to all epidemiological studies using self-reported dietary data. We 
281 
attempted to minimize this bias by adjusting for total energy intake and for plausibility of dietary 
282 
energy reporting; the latter has been recently shown in the EPIC-Potsdam sub-study to improve 
283 
expected associations between intakes of energy-dense foods and BMI [34].  
284 
Strengths of our study include its prospective design with a reasonably long follow-up, the 
285 
very large sample size, which provided sufficient power to also detect smaller associations, despite the 
286 
large variability of weight change, and to perform a number of sensitivity analyses. In order to 
287 
improve dietary intake assessment of nuts, like for many other food groups, it is important to continue 
288 
the search for and validation of biomarkers of nut intake in the future and metabolomics approaches 
289 
may offer new opportunities in this regard [35]. Future research may also assess the mediating role of 
290 
plasma fatty acid changes in the association between nuts and weight change. 
291 
We conclude that in this prospective study of middle-aged adults from 10 European countries 
292 
representing populations with heterogeneous diets, higher nut intake is associated with slightly less 
293 
weight gain after 5 years of follow-up. Higher nut consumers also demonstrated a lower risk of 
294 
becoming overweight or obese. Our findings are thus in line with short-term randomized nut-feeding 
295 
trials and support dietary recommendations to increase nut consumption to reduce chronic disease risk 
296 
and mortality.

Data are expressed as arithmetic mean ± SD if not stated otherwise. 
a First category corresponds to non-consumers of nut intake based on food-frequency questionnaires; categories 2-5 
are quartiles of consumers; note that proportion of subjects in categories 2-5 is unequal because observations with 
the same value were categorised in the same band (‘xtile’ command in Stata). 
b Calculated as weight at follow-up minus weight at baseline divided by the follow-up time in years and multiplied 
by 5 years. 
c Type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer.  
Abbreviations: BMI, body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared); 
IQR, interquartile range; mrMED, modified relative Mediterranean diet score (range: 0-18; higher scores 
characterizing a Mediterranean diet).

Multilevel linear mixed models with random effect on the intercept and slope according to center. 
Overall mean 5-year weight gain corresponded to 2.1 kg (SD 5.0) and negative beta-values indicate less weight gain (kg) over the same period. 
Model 1 adjusted for age, sex, and body mass index (BMI) at baseline (3-knot restricted cubic spline); Model 2 was further adjusted for follow-up time in years (3-knot 
restricted cubic spline), total energy intake (kcal/day), educational level, levels of physical activity, smoking status at follow-up, and plausibility of dietary energy 
reporting; Model 3 was further adjusted for the modified relative Mediterranean diet score (without fruit and nut component). IQR, interquartile range. 
a Frequency data for the centers Cambridge (UK) (n=14,535) and Malmö (Sweden) (n=21,566) were not available.

A modified Poisson regression approach (Zou 2004) was used to calculate the RR and 95% CI. 
Adjusted for age, sex, country/center, BMI at baseline (3-knot restricted cubic spline), follow-up time in years (3-knot restricted cubic spline), total energy 
intake (kcal/day), educational level, levels of physical activity, smoking status at follow-up, and plausibility of dietary energy reporting, and for the modified 
relative Mediterranean diet score (without fruit and nut component). 
a Frequency data for the centers Cambridge (UK) (n=14,535) and Malmö (Sweden) (n=21,566) were not available.
