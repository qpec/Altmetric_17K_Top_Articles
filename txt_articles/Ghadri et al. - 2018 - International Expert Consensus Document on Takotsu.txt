Takotsubo syndrome (TTS) is a poorly recognized heart disease that was initially regarded as a benign condition. Recently, it has been
shown that TTS may be associated with severe clinical complications including death and that its prevalence is probably underestimated.
Since current guidelines on TTS are lacking, it appears timely and important to provide an expert consensus statement on TTS. The clini-
cal expert consensus document part I summarizes the current state of knowledge on clinical presentation and characteristics of TTS and
agrees on controversies surrounding TTS such as nomenclature, different TTS types, role of coronary artery disease, and etiology. This
consensus also proposes new diagnostic criteria based on current knowledge to improve diagnostic accuracy.

History
The term takotsubo syndrome (TTS) was first introduced when Sato
et al.1 published their report of five cases in a Japanese medical
textbook in 1990. The first TTS case of this series was managed in
1983 in the Hiroshima City Hospital (Figure 1). A 64-year-old female
presented with acute chest pain consistent with acute myocardial in-
farction (AMI), typical electrocardiographic (ECG) changes, but normal
coronary arteries and an unusual appearance of the left ventricle (LV)
with a narrow neck and apical ballooning during systole. Interestingly,
the marked wall motion abnormalities on left ventriculography dis-
appeared after 2weeks. Over time TTS was more frequently diag-
nosed in Japan. Therefore, it was first assumed that this disorder only
affected people of Asian descent, as TTS was completely unknown to
the Western world until the first cases were published from French
and American research groups in the late 1990s.2,3 Desmet et al.4
introduced the first patient case series in Caucasians using the term
‘takotsubo’.
Takotsubo syndrome gained international awareness among re-
searcher and physicians when Wittstein et al.5 reported their findings
in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2005. Since then TTS has
been more frequently recognized worldwide but still remains an
underappreciated and often misdiagnosed disorder.6,7
Nomenclature
Takotsubo syndrome derived its name from the Japanese word for
octopus trap, due to the shape of the LV at the end of systole and has
been described under a remarkable number of different names in the
literature including ‘broken heart syndrome’, ‘stress cardiomyopathy’,
and ‘apical ballooning syndrome’.8 No single term precisely describes
the heterogeneous ventricular appearance with which this syndrome
can occur. To date, consensus has not been reached on the nomencla-
ture. The term ‘takotsubo’ is widely used in acknowledgement of the

Japanese physicians who initially described this disorder.1 However, in
contrast to other cardiomyopathies that are usually not transient in na-
ture, TTS is characterized by a temporary wall motion abnormality of
the LV and shares common features with acute coronary syndrome
(ACS) [similar symptoms at presentation, ECG abnormalities, elevated
cardiac biomarkers as well as a comparable in-hospital mortality with
ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non-STEMI]
specifically in terms of a microvascular ACS form.9 Among different eti-
ologies of heart failure such as coronary artery disease (CAD),
tachyarrhtyhmias etc. TTS includes a wide spectrum of emotional or
physical triggers resulting also in left ventricular dysfunction. Therefore,
it is best described as a ‘syndrome’ and the term ‘takotsubo syndrome’
seems most appropriate.9,10,11
Epidemiology
Since the initial report by Japanese cardiologists 25years ago, TTS has
been increasingly recognized in diverse countries across six continents.
Takotsubo syndrome is estimated to represent approximately 1–
3%12,13 of all and 5–6%14 of female patients presenting with suspected
STEMI. The Nationwide Inpatient Sample discharge records from
2008 using the International Classification of Diseases revealed that
TTS accounts for 0.02% of hospitalizations in the United States.15
Recurrence rate of TTS is estimated to be 1.8% per-patient year.16
Based on the published literature about 90%16,17 of TTS patients are
women with a mean age of 67–70years,16,18 and around 80% are older
than 50years (Figure 2).16 Women older than 55years have a five-fold
greater risk of developing TTS than women younger than 55years and
a 10-fold greater risk than men.15 With growing awareness of TTS,
male patients are diagnosed more often, especially after a physical trig-
gering event.19 TTS has also been described in children20,21 with the
youngest reported TTS patient being a premature neonate born in the
28th gestational week.22 Current data on racial differences are incon-
sistent and large-scale studies are lacking. However, it has been re-
ported that TTS seems to be uncommon in African–Americans and
Hispanics,23 while most of the cases reported in the United States
have been Caucasians.15,24 Furthermore, it has been reported that
patients of African-American descent have more in-hospital complica-
tions such as respiratory failure, stroke and require more frequently
mechanical ventilation compared to Caucasians and Hispanics.25 With
regard to ECG differences, it has been shown that QT prolongation as
well as T-wave inversion are more often reported in African-
American women with TTS. 26 Of note, regarding gender differences
the TTS prevalence in men appears to be higher in Japan.19 The preva-
lence of TTS appears to be higher in patients with non-emotional trig-
gers admitted to intensive care units.27 Moreover, it is likely that

Symptoms and signs
The most common symptoms of TTS are acute chest pain, dyspnoea,
or syncope and thus indistinguishable from AMI at the first glance.16
However, in some patients, TTS may be diagnosed incidentally by
new ECG changes or a sudden elevation of cardiac biomarkers.
Clinical manifestation of TTS induced by severe physical stress may
be dominated by the manifestation of the underlying acute illness. In
this regard, patients with ischaemic stroke or seizure-triggered, TTS
had less frequent chest pain,29,30 which could be explained by im-
paired consciousness, neurologic complications, or a sudden haemo-
dynamic deterioration. In contrast, patients with emotional stress
factors had a higher prevalence of chest pain and palpitations.31
Importantly, a subset of TTS patients may present with symptoms
arising from its complications, e.g. heart failure, pulmonary oedema,
stroke, cardiogenic shock, or cardiac arrest.
Diagnostic criteria
The diagnosis of TTS is often challenging because its clinical pheno-
type may closely resemble AMI regarding ECG abnormalities and bio-
markers.32 While a widely established non-invasive tool allowing a
rapid and reliable diagnosis of TTS is currently lacking, coronary angi-
ography with left ventriculography is considered the gold standard
diagnostic tool to exclude or confirm TTS.
Abe et al.33 introduced the first diagnostic criteria for TTS in 2003.
One year later, a dedicated group of cardiologists from the Mayo
Clinic proposed their diagnostic criteria.34 In 2006, the American
College of Cardiology and American Heart Association classified
TTS as a primary acquired cardiomyopathy.35 In 2008, the revised
version of the Mayo Clinic Diagnostic Criteria was published incor-
porating neurogenic stunned myocardium.32 Furthermore, the au-
thors
defined
different
TTS
sub-types
and
highlighted
that
obstructive coronary lesions may occasionally be present concomi-
tantly.32 The Mayo Clinic Diagnostic Criteria are the most widely
known, but exceptions to the rule [e.g. the presence of CAD] are
poorly appreciated among physicians and cardiologists. More re-
cently, other research groups have proposed slightly different criteria
for TTS, i.e. the Japanese Guidelines,36 the Gothenburg criteria,37 the
Johns Hopkins criteria,38 the Tako-tsubo Italian Network proposal,39
the criteria of the Heart Failure Association (HFA) TTS Taskforce of
the European Society of Cardiology (ESC),10 as well as the criteria
recommended by Madias.40 Thus, there is a lack of a worldwide
consensus.41 Based on current knowledge, we have developed
new international diagnostic criteria (InterTAK Diagnostic Criteria,
Table 1) for the diagnosis of TTS that may help to improve identifica-
tion and stratification of TTS. The most important changes with
accompanying rationale include:
(i) Pheochromocytoma is a neuroendocrine tumour derived from
enterochromaffin cells of the adrenal gland that may lead to a ‘cat-
echolamine storm’ with LV dysfunction, ECG abnormalities, and
increased biomarkers as well as hypercontraction of sarcomeres and
contraction band necrosis indistinguishable from TTS.42
Notwithstanding, most of the diagnostic criteria have excluded
pheochromocytoma as a specific cause of TTS.32–34,36,37,40 The
Japanese criteria emphasize that pheochromocytoma is a TTS-like
myocardial dysfunction.36 Pheochromocytoma is also included as a
secondary cause of TTS in the diagnostic criteria of the HFA of the
ESC.10
(ii) Concomitant CAD is reported with a prevalence ranging from
10–29%.16,43,44 In this regard, patients with TTS and obstructive
CAD are often misdiagnosed as classical ACS and differentiation can
be challenging.45 Therefore, the presence of CAD should not be con-
sidered as an exclusion criterion as acknowledged by the modified
Table 1
International Takotsubo Diagnostic Criteria (InterTAK Diagnostic Criteria)
1.
Patients show transienta left ventricular dysfunction (hypokinesia, akinesia, or dyskinesia) presenting as apical ballooning or midventricular, basal,
or focal wall motion abnormalities. Right ventricular involvement can be present. Besides these regional wall motion patterns, transitions be-
tween all types can exist. The regional wall motion abnormality usually extends beyond a single epicardial vascular distribution; however, rare
cases can exist where the regional wall motion abnormality is present in the subtended myocardial territory of a single coronary artery (focal
TTS).b
2.
An emotional, physical, or combined trigger can precede the takotsubo syndrome event, but this is not obligatory.
3.
Neurologic disorders (e.g. subarachnoid haemorrhage, stroke/transient ischaemic attack, or seizures) as well as pheochromocytoma may serve as
triggers for takotsubo syndrome.
4.
New ECG abnormalities are present (ST-segment elevation, ST-segment depression, T-wave inversion, and QTc prolongation); however, rare
cases exist without any ECG changes.
5.
Levels of cardiac biomarkers (troponin and creatine kinase) are moderately elevated in most cases; significant elevation of brain natriuretic peptide
is common.
6.
Significant coronary artery disease is not a contradiction in takotsubo syndrome.
7.
Patients have no evidence of infectious myocarditis.b
8.
Postmenopausal women are predominantly affected.
aWall motion abnormalities may remain for a prolonged period of time or documentation of recovery may not be possible. For example, death before evidence of recovery is
captured.
bCardiac magnetic resonance imaging is recommended to exclude infectious myocarditis and diagnosis confirmation of takotsubo syndrome.

Mayo Clinic Diagnostic Criteria.32 In such patients, the wall motion
abnormalities usually extend beyond the territory of the involved
coronary artery. Furthermore, TTS may co-exist with ACS46 and it
has been reported that ACS itself may trigger TTS.47–50
(iii) There are rare cases in which the regional wall motion abnor-
mality corresponds to the distribution of a single coronary ar-
tery.16,32,51 This holds true for the focal TTS type mostly involving an
anterolateral segment.16,51 Therefore, the criteria should not exclude
cases in which the wall motion abnormalities are restricted to the
distribution of a single coronary artery. In this situation, a clear
differentiation of TTS, ACS, or myocarditis requires cardiac magnetic
resonance imaging demonstrating myocardial oedema rather than
late gadolinium enhancement in case of TTS.52
Pathophysiology
Sympathetic stimulation
The precise pathophysiological mechanisms of TTS are incompletely
understood, but there is considerable evidence that sympathetic
stimulation is central to its pathogenesis. An identifiable emotionally
or physically triggering event precipitates the syndrome in most
cases,16 and TTS has been associated with conditions of catechol-
amine excess (e.g. pheochromocytoma,53 central nervous system dis-
orders54) and activated specific cerebral regions.55 Clinical features
of TTS and the various ballooning patterns can be caused by intraven-
ous administration of catecholamines and beta-agonists.56 Although
it has been shown that patients with TTS triggered by emotional
stress have markedly elevated levels of catecholamines compared to
patients with Killip Class III myocardial infarction,5 others57 could not
replicate this finding most likely due to methodological issues. In line
with a sympathetic stimulation, elevated norepinephrine levels in the
coronary sinus have been found in TTS patients, suggesting an in-
crease
in
the
local
release
of
myocardial
catecholamines.58
Accordingly, analyses of heart rate variability have also demonstrated
a sympathetic predominance and marked depression of parasympa-
thetic activity during the acute phase.59 Microneurographic studies
confirmed
increased
muscle
sympathetic
nerve
activity
and
decreased spontaneous baroreflex control of sympathetic tone in
some TTS patients,60 as did myocardial scintigraphy using 123I-meta-
iodobenzylguanidine.61 Furthermore, abnormalities in myocardial
sympathetic function can persist for months after recovery of LV sys-
tolic function.62 These abnormalities appear to induce an interstitial
mononuclear inflammatory response and occasionally contraction
band necrosis.5
Several animal models have also supported the central role of ad-
renergic stimulation in TTS.63–65 In rats, LV apical ballooning can be
provoked by immobilization stress and attenuated by alpha- and
beta-receptor blockade.66 Furthermore, in a more recent and novel
rat model, it was possible to demonstrate that the administration of
different catecholamines instigates the various ventricular ballooning
patterns by an afterload-dependent mechanism.67
Potential pathophysiological effects of
enhanced sympathetic stimulation
Although enhanced sympathetic stimulation is central to TTS, the
mechanism by which catecholamine excess precipitates myocardial
stunning in the variety of regional ballooning patterns that character-
ize this syndrome is unknown. Several hypotheses have been pro-
posed as follows:
Plaque rupture
It has been suggested that transient ischaemia induced by plaque rup-
ture followed by rapid lysis may cause myocardial stunning in patients
with apparent non-obstructed CAD at angiography. Indeed, eccen-
tric atherosclerotic plaques in the mid-portion of the left anterior
descending (LAD) coronary artery have been reported, but intravas-
cular ultrasound and optical coherence tomography have failed to
identify ruptured plaques in the vast majority of TTS patients.68–70
Furthermore, this explanation is very unlikely as patients with TTS
exhibit wall motion abnormalities extending beyond single coronary
vascular territories and also sometimes include the right ventricle. In
addition, the apical ballooning phenotype is known to occur in the ab-
sence of a wraparound LAD and this coronary anatomical variant is
not more prevalent in TTS than in the control group.71
Multi-vessel epicardial spasm
Sympathetically mediated epicardial spasm has been proposed as a
potential cause in TTS. Takotsubo syndrome may be associated with
endothelial dysfunction and other conditions of abnormal vasomotor
function such as migraine or Raynaud’s phenomenon.72 Similarly,
endothelium-dependent dilation is reduced after emotional stress
and prevented by endothelin antagonists.73 At presentation, patients
with TTS have marked impairment in brachial artery flow-mediated
dilation compared to those with infarction or healthy controls, which
gradually improves over several weeks.74 In the early recovery
period, predisposition to coronary vasospasm using intracoronary
acetylcholine was demonstrated in some, but not all TTS patients.75
Furthermore, it has been suggested that the pattern of LV dysfunc-
tion in patients with TTS may require involvement of specific coron-
ary side branches.76 Similarly, myocardial bridging in the LAD has
been considered.77 Although epicardial coronary vasoconstriction
may contribute to TTS in a subset of patients,1,78 the vast majority of
patients do not show any evidence of epicardial spasm even with use
of provocative agents.
Furthermore, endothelial dysfunction is often associated with oxi-
dative stress, and studies suggest that this may play a role in myocar-
dial dysfunction in TTS. A recent study by Zhang et al.79 found that
hydrogen sulfide relieved cardiac dysfunction in animal models by
decreasing oxidative stress. It has been reported that the level of oxi-
dative stress correlates to the extent of myocardial dysfunction in
TTS patients in the acute recovery phase. Nanno et al.80 measured 8-
hydroxy-2’-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and norepinephrine levels in
TTS patients compared with AMI patients. They found that 8-OHdG
levels changed proportionately with wall motion score and plasma
levels of norepinephrine were twice as high in TTS patients as in AMI
patients.
Microcirculatory dysfunction
Catecholamines and endothelin exert their vasoconstrictor effects
primarily in the coronary microvasculature where a1-receptors81
and endothelin receptor type A predominate suggesting that acute
microcirculatory dysfunction may have a central role in TTS.

Furthermore, acutely TTS exhibits decreased microRNA (miRNA)
125a-5p as well as increased plasma levels of its target endothelin-1
in line with the microvascular spasms hypothesis.82 Microvascular
blood flow may be reduced in the acute phase of TTS as is coronary
flow reserve.83–87 Similarly, increased thrombolysis in myocardial in-
farction (TIMI) frame counts and abnormal grades of TIMI myocardial
perfusion have been noted.11,88
In the acute phase, intravenous administration of adenosine has
been shown to transiently improve myocardial perfusion, wall mo-
tion score index, and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in TTS,
suggesting that intense microvascular constriction plays a major role
in the pathophysiology.89 In addition, the notion of acute microcircu-
latory dysfunction in TTS as a contributing pathophysiological factor
secondary to enhanced sympathetic stimulation is supported by
endomyocardial biopsies revealing apoptosis of microvascular endo-
thelial cells.90 Microcirculatory dysfunction in the acute phase of TTS
is transient and its recovery appears to correlate with improved myo-
cardial function.
Cold pressor testing 1–3 years after the acute episode results in an
elevation of catecholamines and transient apical and mid-LV wall
motion abnormalities.91 Mental stress or reactive hyperaemia result
in lower vasomotor responses, but higher catecholamine levels in
women with TTS compatible with impaired vascular reactivity and
endothelial function.92 Similarly, in women with a history of TTS
coronary vasomotion to acetylcholine is impaired.93 Impaired micro-
vascular endothelial function was observed in virtually all patients
with TTS.
Catecholamine toxicity on cardiomyocytes
Transient LV dysfunction in TTS could also result from direct effects
of catecholamines on cardiomyocytes. Endomyocardial biopsies re-
vealed occasional contraction band necrosis, which is generally
observed in clinical settings of extreme catecholamine production
such as pheochromocytoma or subarachnoid haemorrhage, associ-
ated with hypercontracted sarcomeres, dense eosinophilic trans-
verse bands, and interstitial mononuclear inflammation as a reflection
of myocyte injury.38 Catecholamines can decrease myocyte viability
through cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) mediated Ca2þ
overload as it may occur in TTS. Sarcoplasmic-Ca2þ-adenosine-tri-
phosphatase (SERCA2a) gene expression is downregulated and that
of sarcolipin upregulated, while phospholamban is dephosphorylated
in TTS.94 Thus, an increased phospholamban/SERCA2a ratio could re-
sult in contractile dysfunction due to decreased Ca2þ-affinity.95
Indeed, intense G-protein stimulated b1-adrenergic receptor signalling
modulates gene expression via the cAMP responsive element binding
protein-1 and nuclear factor of activated T-cells signalling pathways.95
In rodent heart failure models, administration of isoproterenol
yields apical fibrosis,96 and abnormalities of apical contraction and
metabolism,97 features known to occur in dysfunctional apical seg-
ments during the acute phase in TTS using fludeoxyglucose-positron
emission tomographic studies.98,99 In animal models, intracellular lipid
droplets accumulate in cardiomyocytes in response to high doses of
catecholamines100 as in endomyocardial biopsies of TTS patients dur-
ing the acute phase, but not after recovery.101 In a rat model of TTS
myocardial perfusion in dysfunctional segments appears preserved,
challenging microvascular spasm as a primary mediator.102
In the mammalian LV b-adrenergic receptor density is highest in
the apex, while sympathetic innervation is the lowest63,103–105 sug-
gesting that it may be more sensitive to high levels of catecholamines
which may reduce not only coronary blood flow, but at high levels
paradoxically also exert negative inotropic effects63,104 due to a
‘molecular switch’ of the b2-adrenergic receptor from the positive
inotropic Gs to the negatively inotropic Gi pathway.106–108 Since
the b2-adrenoceptor is linked via Gi activation to stimulation of
endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthase, it seems possible, that
peroxynitrate mediated nitrosative stress could lead to negative
inotropy and inflammation in TTS. Indeed, TTS patients have
markers of increased NO signalling109 and post-mortem hearts of
TTS patients also demonstrate markers of increased nitrosative
stress.110 Peroxynitrite release would also result in activation of
poly(ADP-ribose)-transferase-1, which might contribute to the
myocardial energetic impairment, which has recently been reported
in patients with TTS.111 Endomyocardial biopsies in patients with TTS
further suggest that these anti-apoptotic pathways are activated
acutely.112 A polymorphism of the G-protein receptor kinase 5
(GRK5) gene L41Q that blunts b2-Gi trafficking appears common
in TTS.113 On the other hand, a larger study failed to support the
conclusions of this study.114
In summary, current evidence suggests that TTS is caused by an
acute release of catecholamines from either sympathetic nerves,
the adrenal medulla, or as drug therapy and occurs primarily in
subjects with increased susceptibility of the coronary microcircu-
lation and of cardiac myocytes to the stress hormones leading
to prolonged but transient LV dysfunction with secondary
myocardial inflammation.
Activation of myocardial survival pathways
The severe wall motion abnormalities seen in TTS are transient sug-
gesting that protective mechanisms are likely to operate to preserve
myocardial integrity. Two different mechanisms might elicit myocar-
dial protection. The first one is represented by adrenoceptor-related
protective mechanisms. Indeed, supra-physiological levels of epineph-
rine trigger b2-adrenoceptor to switch from Gs to Gi coupling, thus
causing a negative inotropic response, which limits the degree of
acute myocardial injury in response to the catecholamine surge.107
The second mechanism is represented by the phosphoinositide
3-kinase/protein kinase B (AKT) survival pathway, which has been
found to be transiently activated during the acute phase of TTS.112
AKT is critical for postnatal cardiac growth and coronary angiogen-
esis. Also, its downstream targets, especially the mechanistic target
of rapamycin and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3), are well-
established regulators of metabolism, proliferation, and cell survival.
Cell survival is achieved through various mechanisms: (i) direct
inhibition of apoptosis, (ii) inhibition of proapoptotic transcriptional
factors, (iii) enhancement of anti-apoptotic transcriptional factors,
and (iv) enhancement of cell metabolism by inhibition of the GSK3.
The demonstration that down-regulation of myocardial function is
a protective mechanism caused by a severe reduction of perfusion is
confirmed by several clinical studies showing ‘inverse perfusion-
metabolism mismatch,’ which is typically observed during myocardial
stunning.115

Predisposition and risk factors
Psychological and physical stressors are universal and affect virtually
all individuals throughout their life. However, very few people de-
velop TTS and even fewer experience recurrent episodes. These ob-
servations support the existence of risk factors that may make
certain individuals more susceptible to TTS. Predisposition and risk
factors for TTS are reviewed below:
Hormonal factors
The striking preponderance of postmenopausal females suggests a
hormonal influence. Potentially, declining oestrogen levels after
menopause increase the susceptibility to TTS in women.116 Indeed,
women older than 55years have an almost five-fold risk of develop-
ing TTS compared to those younger than 55 years.15 Oestrogens can
influence vasomotor tone via up-regulation of endothelial NO syn-
thase.117 Also, there is evidence that oestrogens can attenuate
catecholamine-mediated vasoconstriction and decrease the sympa-
thetic response to mental stress in perimenopausal women.118,119 In
women with subarachnoid haemorrhage, low levels of oestradiol
have been associated with an increased risk of LV wall motion
abnormalities.120 In ovariectomized rats subjected to immobiliza-
tion stress, ECG and contractile abnormalities can be induced
and attenuated with oestrogen supplementation.121 However,
systematic data demonstrating a clear link between oestrogen
levels and the development of TTS are lacking so far.
Genetic factors
A genetic predisposition to TTS has been suggested by a report of five
cases of familial TTS, two in mother-daughter pairs122,123 and three in
pairs of sisters.124–126 Takotsubo syndrome does not appear to have a
multigenerational Mendelian inheritance pattern. Hence, it is likely that
a genetic predisposition (if present) may interact with environmental
factors, polygenic aetiology and/or recessive susceptibility alleles.
Polymorphisms in adrenergic genes indeed affect receptor function
and downstream signalling, 127 and this raises the possibility that their
distribution may differ in TTS patients. Indeed, functional variants of ad-
renergic receptor genes have been associated with the magnitude of
cardiac dysfunction in patients with subarachnoid haemorrhage128 and
pheochromocytoma,129 conditions which can trigger TTS.
b1-adrenergic receptor (amino acid position 389) and b2-adrener-
gic receptor (amino acid position 27) variants were associated with a
greater release of troponin I and a2-adrenergic receptor deletion
(del322–325) with reduced LVEF.128 However, a2c-adrenergic re-
ceptor and b1-adrenergic receptor polymorphisms do not seem to
differ between TTS and controls.130 In contrast, a different distribu-
tion of b1-receptor polymorphisms Arg389Gly [homozygous argin-
ine (Arg)/Arg] is more frequently found in TTS, while b2-receptor
polymorphisms Gln27Glu [homozygous glutamine (Gln)/Gln] were
found more frequently in healthy controls, and no difference was
observed in the b2-receptor Arg16Gly variant between groups.131
Furthermore, similar genetic polymorphisms in the b1-adrenergic re-
ceptor and the b2-adrenergic receptor were noted in TTS and con-
trols, while a higher frequency of rs17098707 polymorphism in the
GRK5 gene was found in TTS patients.113 Unfortunately, these stud-
ies provide conflicting results and are limited in their gene-targeted
approach and incomplete in genetic characterization of the complex
adrenergic signalling network. Whole-exome sequencing in 28 TTS
subjects revealed no difference in allele frequency or burden be-
tween TTS subjects and population controls.132 As such, these data
do not provide strong evidence for a genetic predisposition in TTS,
but lend support to genetic heterogeneity and a potential polygenic
susceptibility conferring a cumulative effect on dysregulation of ad-
renergic pathways. Most of the published studies were conducted in
small cohorts and much larger cohorts are required to evaluate the
genetics of TTS comprehensively.
Borchert et al.133 have investigated a genetic predisposition for
TTS by creating the first ‘takotsubo in a dish’ model by using TTS-
specific induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-
CMs). This model recapitulates some of the pathophysiology
observed in patients during the acute phase of TTS allowing further
exploration of underlying mechanisms.134 They found an overactive
b-adrenergic pathway and higher sensitivity of catecholamines in TTS
iPSC-CMs and TTS engineered heart muscle.133 Interestingly, recep-
tor desensitization and different b1/b2-adrenoreceptor responses
shed further light on the mechanisms of TTS. Based on this TTS-
model future treatment targets should be identified to rescue pa-
tients with TTS.133,134
Psychiatric and neurologic disorders
A high prevalence of psychiatric and neurologic disorders has been re-
ported in patients with TTS. In an age- and sex-matched comparison
between patients with TTS and ACS, rates of psychiatric or neuro-
logic disorders were substantially higher in TTS.16 In this regard, 27%
had an acute, former, or chronic history of neurologic disorders and
42% had a psychiatric diagnosis with half of them suffering from de-
pression.16 Indeed, anxiety and depression appear more common in
TTS than in patients with STEMI or healthy controls135 and in a pro-
spective study, the prevalence of depression and anxiety was 78%,
much higher than in patients with ACS.136 Patients with TTS also ap-
pear to have a high prevalence of type-D-personality, which is charac-
terized by negative emotions and social inhibition, and which has been
associated with an increased cardiovascular risk.137 However, another
study found no difference in the personality profile and stress coping
skills
between
TTS
patients
and
population
controls.138,139
Interestingly, in a recent study comparing the signature of circulating
miRNAs in TTS and STEMI, miR-16 and miR-26a, known to be associ-
ated with neuropsychiatric conditions, were significantly upregulated
in TTS.82 Psychological disorders may thus have a pathogenic role. Of
note, depressed patients have an exaggerated norepinephrine re-
sponse to emotional stress,140 and a subset of patients has an
increased spillover and decreased reuptake of norepinephrine.
Similarly, patients with panic disorder and anxiety have a decreased
catecholamine reuptake due to impairment of norepinephrine reup-
take transporters.141 On the other hand, antidepressants, e.g. selective
norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, may facilitate myocardial stunning
by increasing local levels of catecholamines.142 This increased sympa-
thetic response to acute stress combined with greater cardiac sympa-
thetic sensitivity may make patients with mood disorders and anxiety
susceptible to stress-related cardiac dysfunction.
Takotsubo syndrome has been reported to occur after neurologic
disorders especially stroke,143 subarachnoid haemorrhage,144 and
seizures.29 Histopathological findings of autopsied patients with sud-
den unexpected death in epilepsy revealed contraction band

necrosis,145 abnormalities also found in autopsied patients with
TTS.146 It has been demonstrated that regions of the insular or pos-
terior fossa are mainly affected in patients with ischaemic stroke and
epileptic events.147 This suggests that neurologic or psychiatric condi-
tions may serve as predisposing factors for the development of TTS.
Furthermore, a heart-brain interaction has been proposed in TTS. In
this regard, substantial structural differences between TTS and
healthy controls have been shown including the limbic network
comprising the insula, amygdala, cingulate cortex, and hippocampus,
all of which are strongly involved in the control of emotional process-
ing, cognition, and the autonomic nervous system.148
Triggers
A hallmark of TTS is its association with a preceding stressful event.
Initially, most reported triggers involved an emotional trauma.1 As
TTS became more known, an association with physical stressors was
also noted as well as TTS cases that occur in the absence of an evi-
dent stressor.16,149 A systematic illustration of preceding emotional
and physical stressors is shown in Figure 3.
Physical triggers are more common than emotional stress fac-
tors.16 Interestingly, male patients are more often affected from a
physical stressful event, while in women an emotional trigger can be
more frequently observed.16 Of note, precipitating triggers may rep-
resent a combination of emotional and physical issues16 (e.g. panic at-
tack during a medical procedure), as well as environmental triggers
such as long-term exposure to aircraft noise150. On the other hand,
about one-third of patients presents without evidence of an identifi-
able preceding stressful event.151
In hospitalized patients, TTS may have an atypical presentation and
manifest itself by tachycardia, hypotension, heart failure, elevation of
cardiac biomarkers, or ECG abnormalities. It has been reported that
patients with in-hospital TTS are more frequently males and have a
higher prevalence of in-hospital death compared to patients with out-
of-hospital TTS.152 This suggests that out-of-hospital TTS often occurs
in the absence of a critical medical problem, while in-hospital TTS is
preceded mainly by chronic comorbidities or acute medical illnesses.
Emotional stressors
Psychological triggers represent a range of traumatic emotions
including grief (e.g. death of a family member, friend, or pet), interper-
sonal conflicts (e.g. divorce or family estrangement), fear and panic
(e.g. robbery, assault, or public speaking), anger (e.g. argument with a
family member or landlord), anxiety (e.g. personal illness, childcare,
or homelessness), financial or employment problems (e.g. gambling
loss, business failure, or job loss), or embarrassment (e.g. legal pro-
ceedings, infidelity, incarceration of family member, defeat in a com-
petitive event).149 Natural disasters such as earthquakes153,154 and
floods155 are also associated with an increase in TTS events.
However, emotional triggers are not always negative as positive
emotional events can also provoke TTS (e.g. surprise birthday party,
winning a jackpot, and positive job interview)156 as shown in Figure 3.
This entity has been described as the ’happy heart syndrome.156
Physical stressors
Physical stressors may be related to physical activities (for instance
heavy gardening157 or sports158), medical conditions, or proce-
dures such as acute respiratory failure (e.g. asthma,159 end-stage
chronic obstructive lung disease160), pancreatitis,161 cholecyst-
itis,162 pneumothorax,163 traumatic injury,164 sepsis,165 thyrotoxi-
cosis,166
malignancy
also
including
chemotherapy167
and
radiotherapy,168 pregnancy,169 Caesarean section,170 lightning
strike,171 near drowning,172 hypothermia,173 cocaine,174 alcohol175
or opiate withdrawal,176 and carbon-monoxide poisoning.177
Exogenous drugs in terms of catecholamines56,178 and sympatho-
mimetic drugs56,179 may also act as triggers for TTS including
dobutamine stress testing,180 electrophysiological testing181 (with
isoproterenol or epinephrine) and beta-agonists for asthma or
chronic obstructive lung disease.179,182 Also, acute coronary artery
obstruction might act also as a trigger for TTS.47
Nervous system conditions (e.g. stroke,143 head trauma,183 mi-
graine72, intracerebral haemorrhage,184 or seizures29) also represent
an important trigger in the acute onset of TTS.
Endogenous catecholamine spillover related to pheochromocy-
toma serves as a distinct physical trigger.
Absence of identifiable causes
Recognition that TTS may occur spontaneously has demonstrated
the inappropriateness of the term ‘stress cardiomyopathy’ to de-
scribe the entire spectrum of TTS. Whether the clinical course differs
for this subset is unknown, and levels of catecholamines and related
hormones have not been reported.
Types of takotsubo syndrome
Although several anatomical TTS variants have been described four
major types can be differentiated based on the distribution of regional
wall motion abnormalities as shown in Figure 4.16,51 The most com-
mon TTS type and widely recognized form is the (i) apical ballooning
type also known as the typical TTS form, which occurs in the majority
of cases.16,51 Over the past years, atypical TTS types have been
increasingly recognized.51 These include the (ii) midventricular, (iii)
basal, and (iv) focal wall motion patterns.51 Recently, it has been dem-
onstrated that patients suffering from atypical TTS have a different
clinical phenotype.51 These patients are younger, suffer more often
from neurologic comorbidities, have lower brain natriuretic peptide
values, a less impaired LVEF, and more frequent ST-segment depres-
sion compared to typical TTS.51,185 In-hospital complication rate is
similar between typical and atypical types, while 1-year mortality is
higher in typical TTS.51 After adjustment for confounders, LVEF
<45%, atrial fibrillation, neurologic disorders but not TTS phenotype
were independent predictors of death.51 Beyond 1-year, long-term
mortality is similar in typical and atypical TTS phenotypes, therefore,
patients should be equally monitored and treated.51 The basal
phenotype has been reported to be associated with the presence of
pheochromocytoma,186 epinephrine-induced TTS,178 or subarach-
noid haemorrhage187 consequently, these conditions should be
considered in this particular setting.
Besides the four major TTS types, other morphological variants
have been described including the biventricular (apical type and right

ventricular involvement),19 isolated right ventricular,188,189 and global
form.190 Global hypokinesia as a manifestation of TTS is difficult to
prove given the very broad differential diagnoses including conditions
such as tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy. Right ventricular
involvement is present in about one-third of TTS patients and may be
a predictor for worse outcome.191 The true prevalence of the iso-
lated right ventricular form is unknown since little attention is paid to
the right ventricle in daily clinical echo routine.

Patients with recurrent TTS can demonstrate different wall
motion patterns at each event,192,193 suggesting that left ventricu-
lar adrenergic receptor distribution does not explain different
TTS types.
Chronobiology
A growing body of evidence reveals that acute cardiovascular events
are not distributed randomly over time, but instead depend on the
time of day, day of the week, and months/season of the year.194–197
Several studies have investigated chronobiological features of TTS.
Two studies reported a peak in the morning198,199 and afternoon
hours,200 while others failed to show a statistically significant tem-
poral pattern.201 Two studies observed the highest frequency on
Monday196,202 and a third investigation has not found a weekly
variation.198 Most conducted studies reported a summer prefer-
ence for TTS,24,203 while one study reported a winter peak.204
Hence, conflicting results about the chronobiological pattern of
TTS exist.
Funding
J.R.G. has received a research grant “Filling the gap” from the University
of Zurich.
Conflict of interest: none declared.
