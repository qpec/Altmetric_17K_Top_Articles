ABSTRACT
Background: Diet is frequently associated with both the develop-
ment and prevention of type 2 diabetes (T2D), but there is a lack
of objective tools for assessing the relation between diet and
T2D. Biomarkers of dietary intake are unconfounded by recall and
reporting bias, and using multiple dietary biomarkers could help
strengthen the link between a healthy diet and the prevention of
T2D.
Objective: The objective of this study was to explore how diet is
related to glucose tolerance status (GTS) and to future development
of T2D irrespective of common T2D and cardiovascular disease risk
factors by using multiple dietary biomarkers.
Design: Dietary biomarkers were measured in plasma from 64-y-
old Swedish women with different GTS [normal glucose tolerance
(NGT; n = 190), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT; n = 209),
and diabetes (n = 230)]. The same subjects were followed up after
5 y to determine changes in glucose tolerance (n = 167 for NGT,
n = 174 for IGT, and n = 159 for diabetes). ANCOVA and logistic
regression were used to explore baseline data for associations
between dietary biomarkers, GTS, and new T2D cases at follow-
up (n = 69).
Results: Of the 10 dietary biomarkers analyzed, b-alanine (beef)
(P-raw , 0.001), alkylresorcinols C17 and C19 (whole-grain wheat
and rye) (P-raw = 0.003 and 0.011), eicosapentaenoic acid (fish)
(P-raw = 0.041), 3-carboxy-4-methyl-5-propyl-2-furanpropanoic
acid (CMPF) (fish) (P-raw = 0.002), linoleic acid (P-raw , 0.001),
oleic acid (P-raw = 0.003), and a-tocopherol (margarine and vegeta-
ble oil) (P-raw , 0.001) were associated with GTS, and CMPF (fish)
(OR: 0.72; 95% CI: 0.56, 0.93; P-raw = 0.013) and a-tocopherol
(OR: 0.71; 95% CI: 0.51, 0.98; P-raw = 0.041) were inversely asso-
ciated with future T2D development.
Conclusions: Several circulating dietary biomarkers were strongly
associated with GTS after correction for known T2D risk factors, under-
lining the role of diet in the development and prevention of T2D. To our
knowledge, this study is the first to use multiple dietary biomarkers to
investigate the link between diet and disease risk.

INTRODUCTION
Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is one of the fastest-growing health care
problems worldwide. Globally 422 million adults had diabetes in
2014, 314 million more than in 1980, and the incidence of T2D is
expected to rise (1). Prevention of T2D is the most effective
strategy to reduce the cost and burden of this disease and the
only way to arrest the increase in T2D incidence. Lifestyle
factors are strongly associated with the development of T2D,
and lifestyle changes, such as a healthier diet, reducing smoking,
and increasing exercise are among the most effective means of
preventing T2D (2–5).
Diets rich in whole grains, fruits, vegetables, legumes, and
nuts, moderate in alcohol consumption, and lower in refined
grains, red or processed meats, and sugar-sweetened beverages
have been linked to a reduced risk of diabetes (6). However, the
tools for assessing diet have long relied on dietary recall methods,
such as food-frequency questionnaires and 24-h recalls. Although
these methods provide a standardized tool for measuring dietary
and nutrient intake, they have several well-known limitations,
including reliance on self-reporting as well as multiple as-
sumptions about food composition and serving size (7–9). To aid
in the assessment of diet, biomarkers of dietary intake and nu-
trient status could serve as complimentary tools for the more
accurate estimation of food and nutrient intake by combining
both subjective (e.g., questionnaires) and objective (e.g., bio-
markers) measures that have unrelated measurement errors (10).

 Biomarkers also allow the exploration of associations between
diet and disease in cohorts where dietary intake data are missing
or inadequate. Recent studies have shown the usefulness of a
single class of dietary intake biomarkers to find associations be-
tween diet and glucose tolerance as well as T2D (11, 12). These
highlight the utility of biomarkers in research aiming to uncover
relations between diet and T2D. To our knowledge, no work has
been done with the use of multiple dietary and nutrient status
biomarkers to reflect dietary intake to examine the association
with both glycemic control and future development of T2D. The
use of several markers of diet intake and nutrient status could
give a wider perspective on the associations between diet and
disease.
The aim of the present study was to investigate associations
between a panel of biomarkers of diet and nutrient status detected
by using a semitargeted metabolomics method and glucose
tolerance status (GTS) and future T2D development in a pro-
spective cohort of 64-y-old Swedish women.
METHODS
Study participants
A population-based cohort was started in 2001 by inviting all
women turning 64 y old who were living in the Gothenburg
region of Sweden to participate in a screening examination for
T2D (13). At baseline, WHO criteria were used for the definitions
of diabetes mellitus and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) (14).
The screening examination included fasting capillary whole
blood glucose measurements in women with overt diabetes and
repeated oral glucose tolerance tests (13, 15) in women without
overt diabetes. Of the screened cohort of 2595 women, 9.5%
had diabetes mellitus and 14.4% had IGT. Women with dia-
betes, IGT, and normal glucose tolerance (NGT) were ran-
domly selected and invited to participate in a nested case-control
study, which included a baseline and a follow-up examina-
tion after 5.5 y (Figure 1). In total, 629 women participated
in the first examination, and samples from 614 subjects were
analyzed by gas chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry

 (GC-MS/MS)-based metabolomics (T2D: n = 202; IGT: n = 203;
NGT: n = 188; type 1 diabetes: n = 21). A reexamination was
performed after 5.5 y in 500 women with diabetes (n = 159), IGT
(n = 174), or NGT (n = 167) according to the classification at
baseline. The remaining 129 women from the original study did
not participate in the reexamination because of death (n = 23) or
severe disease (n = 3), they were no longer living in the area
(n = 12), or they were unwilling to participate (n = 91) (15). Of
those originally in the IGT and NGT groups, 69 were diagnosed
as having T2D at follow-up. Dietary intake was not assessed in
this cohort. Baseline characteristics for the women included in the
analysis are shown in Table 1. The study was approved by the
ethics committee at Sahlgrenska University Hospital in Gothen-
burg, Sweden.
Dietary biomarker measurement by using GC-MS/MS
metabolomics
Dietary biomarkers were measured by using GC-MS/MS
metabolomics as previously described (16). This method detects
metabolites, including dietary biomarkers, by using both mass
spectrometry–based scanning (untargeted) and more selective
and sensitive single-ion monitoring and multiple-reaction mon-
itoring (MRM) modes, which detect predefined metabolites. Plasma
was extracted with methanol:water (9:1, vol:vol) derivatized
by using methoxymation followed by silylation (16). Samples
were injected onto a Shimadzu GCMS TQ-8030 GC-MS/MS
(Shimadzu Europa GmbH), and both scan and MRM data were
collected for further data analysis. Biomarkers previously as-
sociated with either dietary intake or nutrient status and that
were detected in human plasma by this method are a- and
d-tocopherol (vitamin E), alkylresorcinols C17 and C19 (whole-
grain wheat and rye), b-alanine (meat), 3-carboxy-4-methyl-
5-propyl-2-furanpropanoic acid (CMPF) (fish), lauric acid
(saturated fat), oleic acid (common dietary sources include olive
and rapeseed oils, almonds, hazelnuts, and avocados), EPA
(fish), and linoleic acid (common dietary sources include seeds,
nuts, and vegetable oils) (Table 2).
Metabolomics data processing
A MATLAB (Mathworks) script and database developed at the
Swedish Metabolomics Centre was used for targeted analysis of
the full-scan data (23). The internal standard normalization of
raw data was performed by using the method of Jonsson et al.
(23). Internal standard variables from each sample were scaled to
unit variance and modeled together by using principle component
analysis (SIMCA+; Umetrics AB) to describe the overall vari-
ation in the multivariate space. Vectors from the first component
were then used to correct for the analytic variation between
samples. The MRM data were processed and normalized as
described earlier (16). The 2 data sets, targeted measurements

 from full-scan data and MRM, were then merged for statistical
analyses.
Biochemical analysis
Blood glucose, insulin, adiponectin, total cholesterol, HDL,
LDL, free fatty acid, and triglyceride measurements were per-
formed by using standard clinical chemistry techniques as pre-
viously described at the clinical chemistry laboratory of the
Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg (15).
Data analysis strategy
Baseline samples used for exploring the associations between
the 10 biomarkers and GTS groups were defined as NGT, IGT,
and T2D and new T2D cases at follow-up irrespective of common
risk factors of T2D and cardiovascular disease (CVD). ANCOVA
and Tukey’s post hoc t test were used for comparing the GTS
groups and logistic regression for testing if baseline biomarker
values were associated with new T2D at follow-up (Figure 1).
All data were checked for normal distribution, and skewed
variables were log transformed. For logistic regression analysis,
each biomarker was scaled to have a mean of 0 and an SD of 1
to have comparable units for all biomarkers. Because the results
are not quantitative and are relative responses of mass spec-
trometer peak areas, differences between groups are reported as
fold changes. As the focus of this work was the relation between
dietary biomarkers and the development of T2D, subjects with
previously diagnosed T2D or type 1 diabetes were excluded
from the analyses. Waist circumference, total cholesterol, HDL,
LDL, free fatty acids, systolic blood pressure, triglycerides, and
medication for nondiabetic conditions were considered potential
confounders and were first individually tested for each bio-
marker and outcome combination (stage 1). After this a step-
wise model reduction was performed starting from the model
including all potential confounders, followed by removal of the
least significant variables one by one, and ending with a model
including only significant (P , 0.05) confounders (stage 2)
(Table 3). One type of diuretic medication (bendroflumethiazide)
was found to confound the association of baseline values of the
biomarkers with the development of diabetes at follow-up but
was used by only 4 subjects. Removing these 4 subjects from the
population did not change the results, which are reported based
on all subjects. Results for the logistic regression are reported
as ORs and 95% CIs for one SD change in concentration of a
biomarker for significant biomarkers. Results from ANCOVA
models comparing GTS were reported as fold differences com-
pared with NGT and with IGT in the case of T2D. In line with the
explorative nature of the work that does not allow for power
calculations, we report both raw and Benjamini-Hochberg false
discovery rate–corrected P values. We treated results with a raw
P value of ,0.05 as being of interest.
Predictive models were used to test if the baseline values of the
biomarkers can predict the subjects who developed T2D during
the 5.5-y follow-up and how the prediction with biomarkers
compares with other prediction models for the development of
T2D. Four different prediction models based on the biomarkers in
this study and earlier established predictors in this cohort (15)

 were tested: 1) diet and nutrition biomarkers model based on the
biomarkers measured in this study, 2) anthropometry model
based on smoking, alcohol consumption, waist circumference,
systolic blood pressure, and family history, 3) adiponectin model
based on serum adiponectin concentration, HOMA-IR, smoking,
and IGT and impaired fasting glucose (IFG) at baseline, and 4)
combination model based on a combined model from predictors
in models 1 and 3. All dietary biomarkers were used for pre-
diction in models 1 and 4. The area under the receiver operating
characteristics curve was used to assess the discriminating power
of the prediction models and was calculated with the trapezoidal
rule by using the R-package pROC (version 1.8). All statistical
analyses were performed by using the R statistical environment
(version 3.0.2).
RESULTS
Of the subjects with blood plasma samples available from the
baseline measurement, 188 subjects had NGT, 203 had IGT, and
202 had T2D. As expected, subjects with NGT had lower waist
circumference, systolic blood pressure, and free fatty acid and
triglyceride concentrations compared with subjects with IGT and
T2D and had slightly higher or similar HDL, LDL, and total
cholesterol concentrations compared with subjects with IGT and
T2D (Table 1).
Associations between dietary biomarkers and glucose
tolerance
Of the 10 diet and nutrient biomarkers measured by using
the GC-MS/MS metabolomics method, at baseline b-alanine,
alkylresorcinols C17 and C19, EPA, lauric, linoleic and oleic
acids, and a-tocopherol differed between the NGT and IGT
groups, and b-alanine, CMPF, linoleic acid, and a-tocopherol
differed between the NGT and T2D groups (Table 4). CMPF
and linoleic acid differed between the IGT and T2D groups.
g-Tocopherol did not differ between any of the GTSs. Among
the significant biomarkers, b-alanine and CMPF were lower
in subjects with NGT compared with IGT and T2D. The 2
alkylresorcinols were higher in subjects with NGT compared
with IGT, a-tocopherol was higher in subjects with NGT com-
pared with IGT and T2D, oleic acid and EPA were higher in
subjects with NGT compared with IGT, linoleic acid was higher
in subjects with NGT compared with IGT and higher in sub-
jects with T2D compared with NGT and IGT (see Table 4 for
fold changes).
Baseline concentrations of biomarkers and future
development of T2D
a-Tocopherol and CMPF were inversely associated with new
T2D at the follow-up examination (P = 0.01; OR: 0.72; 95% CI:
0.56, 0.93 and P = 0.04; OR: 0.71; 95% CI: 0.51, 0.98, re-
spectively) (Table 5). The P values were no longer ,0.05 after
correction for multiple comparisons. None of the other bio-
markers measured was associated with future T2D risk. Pre-
diction of new T2D at the follow-up examination based on a
model that included all the diet and nutrient biomarkers had
nominally higher sensitivity and selectivity (AUC: 0.724;

(AUC: 0.638; 95% CI: 0.565, 0.711). Inclusion of diet and nu-

DISCUSSION
We have explored the associations between multiple dietary
biomarkers and glucose tolerance accounting for common risk
factors of T2D and CVD and have prospectively assessed
whether these were associated with new cases of T2D at a 5-y
follow-up. In addition, we tested if these biomarkers could be
used for the prediction of T2D and compared how the prediction
based on dietary and nutritional biomarkers compares with
established predictive markers of T2D. We found that 8 of
the 10 diet-related biomarkers detected were associated with
GTS, supporting the notion that diet is an important factor for
preventing T2D. The results based on the dietary biomarkers
suggest that an overall higher consumption of whole-grain
products, fatty fish, and vegetable oils is associated with better
GTS, whereas a higher consumption of meat was associated with a
greater risk of IGT. This pattern is in line with many healthy diet
recommendations, including the American Diabetes Association
(24) and the Nordic Nutrition Recommendations (25). Further-
more, by using the combined dietary biomarkers it was possible
to predict new cases of T2D during the 5.5-y follow up with
specificity and sensitivity similar to using serum adiponectin
concentration, HOMA-IR, smoking, and IGTand IFG at baseline,
which were the best predictors of T2D in this cohort (15).
Diet is commonly associated with many risk factors for T2D
(4), and positive dietary changes are among the recommendations
for people at risk of developing T2D. On finding the association
between dietary biomarkers and GTS and T2D development, we
hypothesized that correcting for common risk factors of T2D and
CVD, including systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, LDL,
HDL, triglycerides, free fatty acids, and obesity, would attenuate

ASSOCIATIONS OF INTAKE BIOMARKERS AND T2D

 the effects of the biomarkers, based on a healthy diet leading to an
overall healthier lifestyle. Surprisingly, the associations of the
dietary biomarkers with GTS remained, irrespective of the risk
factors, suggesting that whole grains, fish, saturated fat, mar-
garine and vegetable oil, vitamin E, and meat may be related to
and mediate T2D development beyond their known or suggested
effects on obesity and metabolism (26–28).
Of the biomarkers used, several may have a direct link to
the development of T2D. Plasma alkylresorcinols are well-
established markers of whole-grain wheat and rye intake (18,
29, 30) and were found to improve insulin sensitivity in rats (31).
Although they have not been directly studied for effects on
glucose metabolism in humans, this is the first study to our
knowledge to find a relation between alkylresorcinol concen-
trations and GTS and it supports earlier work that has found a
relation between the ratios of specific alkylresorcinol homologs
and T2D incidence (12). CMPF has been suggested to be a
biomarker for fish intake (20), although increased circulating
concentrations have been found to lead to a loss of glucose
control via b cell dysfunction (32). Furthermore, CMPF was
associated with T2D development in a prospective study (33).
Our results show divergent associations, with CMPF being as-
sociated with both IGT and a reduced risk of developing T2D,
suggesting that plasma CMPF concentrations may reflect 2 dif-
ferent outcomes: as a modulator of b cell dysfunction leading to
T2D, and in populations without T2D and as a possible biomarker
of fish intake, suggesting healthier dietary choices. a-Tocopherol
reflects vitamin E status, and its relations with complications of
T2D are not yet fully elucidated (34–36), although a recent study
described vitamin E metabolism as associated with glucose
control in both lean and obese subjects (37). Tocopherol metab-
olism can also be influenced by other dietary components (38),
further confounding the direct relation between a-tocopherol and
disease. EPA is one of the n–3 fatty acids commonly associated
with marine foods (39) and recommended for improved car-
diometabolic health (40). Also, EPA supplementation has been
shown to improve glycemic control (41, 42). Recently we found
that b-alanine was increased after beef intake compared with fish
because of a high amount of b-alanine in beef mince compared
with fish (17), suggesting that b-alanine may reflect beef intake.
Other studies have linked b-alanine and carnosine (b-alanine
conjugated with the amino acid histidine) with T2D, which may
also explain this result (43–45).
Although these biomarkers are by no means comprehensive in
their coverage of diet, they do reflect several food groups that are
of interest for T2D development. These biomarker results support
previous findings on whole grains (12, 46–48), a-tocopherol (49,
50), fish (51), and a reduction of T2D risk, although the litera-
ture in relation to fish intake and T2D is not conclusive (52).
Also, the present potential association of meat intake supports
earlier findings of meat intake and increased T2D risk (53–55).
There were slightly higher linoleic acid concentrations in sub-
jects with T2D than in subjects with NGT, supporting the earlier
work suggesting that excess circulating linoleic acid could have
adverse health effects (56).
One of the strengths of the current study is the application of
a multiple-nutritional biomarker approach in a free-living pop-
ulation, which gives a holistic picture of normal within pop-
ulation dietary variation and its association with GTS and the
development of T2D. Biomarkers give an unbiased view of food
intake but do have their own set of limitations based on variations
in food composition, bioavailability, and metabolism (39, 57, 58).
In this context, the results should be interpreted with some
caution. a-Tocopherol and EPA are used in several biological
processes, and although they are of dietary origin (although EPA
can be synthesized from a-linolenic acid), plasma concentra-
tions are influenced by several factors other than diet. For ex-
ample, EPA is metabolized during elevated inflammation (59),
which can confound its relation with fish intake and further
genetic factors might also affect synthesis (60). Additionally,
there may be some bias introduced by the use of a broad
extraction-and-analysis method that covers a wide range of
compound classes. A general extraction method was used that
has been optimized to reproducibly extract many different
compounds for metabolomics analysis by GC-MS (61) and may
not be optimal for all compounds, especially those that are
highly lipophilic, including the alkylresorcinols and tocopherols.
An advantage of this approach is that the method could be ex-
panded to cover a wider range of biomarkers as they continue to
be discovered, thus improving our ability to cover a wide range
of foods and nutrients. Furthermore, there are many gaps in our
knowledge about how well a broad range of dietary biomarkers
perform in observational settings, in part because of a lack of
validation studies for many biomarkers. In the present study, the
relatively large, well-defined, and homogeneous cohort provides a
good starting point for testing the use of a broad panel of dietary
biomarkers, and the results suggest that the use of dietary and
nutrient status biomarkers could be a useful way to study the
relation between diet and disease. Further studies with the use of
this methodology in cohorts with diet intake information should
be carried out to confirm that this approach of using one method
to cover multiple biomarkers is valid.
Despite the known limitations, the wider application of dietary
biomarkers to improve dietary intake estimates in research is
encouraged, and several studies have demonstrated the potential
of using several markers in the context of intervention studies (29,
30, 62). The biomarker panel measured in the current study
covers some of the important food groups and represents the first
multi-dietary biomarker analysis in the study of T2D. More work
is needed to improve biomarker coverage for future studies, and
further study in cohorts with existing dietary recall data are
needed to further validate the approach.
In conclusion, our results suggest that a diet high in whole grains,
vegetable oil, and fish, as well as a-tocopherol as measured by a
multiple-biomarker approach can be a factor in controlling GTS
and T2D development in free-living, 64-y-old Swedish women
irrespective of common T2D and CVD risk factors. The multiple
dietary and nutrient-status biomarker approach can capture dif-
ferent dietary components with one method and represents a step
toward a universal methodology for the unbiased assessment of
diet for use alone or in conjunction with self-reported dietary
assessment.
