ABSTRACT
Bovine tuberculosis is a zoonotic infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium bovis that affects cattle
and can cause tuberculosis in a range of wildlife animals. A bacteriophage-based method combined
with PCR (phage-PCR) has been recently used to detect and identify viable pathogenic
mycobacteria in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of animals suffering from
paratuberculosis. To adapt this method for the detection of M. bovis in blood, a new isothermal DNA
amplification protocol using Recombinase Polymerase Amplification (RPA) was developed and was
found to be able to detect M. bovis BCG within 48 h, with a limit of detection of approximately 10
cells per ml of blood for artificially inoculated blood samples. When blood samples (2 ml) from a
Single Comparative Cervical Intradermal Tuberculin (SCCIT)- negative beef herd were tested,
Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC) cells were not detected from any (45) of the blood
samples. However when blood samples from SCCIT-positive animals were tested, viable MTC
bacteria were detected in 66 % (27/41) of samples. Of these 41 animals sampled, 32 % (13) had
visible lesions. In the visible lesion (VL) group, 85 % (11/13) had detectable levels of MTC whereas
only 57 % (16/28) of animals which had no visible lesions (NVL) were found to have detectable
mycobacteraemia. These results indicated that this simple, rapid method can be applied for the
study of M. bovis infections. The frequency with which viable mycobacteria were detected in the
peripheral blood of SCCIT-positive animals changes the paradigm of this disease.

Introduction
Mycobacterium bovis is the causative agent of bovine
tuberculosis and forms part of Mycobacterium tuberculo-
sis Complex group of pathogens. Bovine tuberculosis is a
disease that affects primarily cattle, but can infect
humans as well as a variety of other domestic and wild
mammals.1 Despite eradication schemes being in place
since the 1950s, the UK has struggled to eradicate the
disease; in fact the incidence of BTB outbreaks has
increased and control measures continue to be a signifi-
cant economic burden for this UK agriculture sector.2 A
major barrier to understanding and diagnosing M. bovis
infection is that culture of these slow growing organisms
is difficult, time consuming and often impracticable.
This is especially true when undertaking epidemiological,
infection or immunological studies compared to bacterial
load.3 In addition to the long incubation times required,
a specific limitation of culture is that chemical decon-
tamination used to inhibit the growth of competing
bacteria also reduces the viability of the mycobacterial
cells present in samples, reducing the sensitivity and reli-
ability of culture as a method to detect and understand
the disease.4
Essentially due to these difficulties, an area of bovine
tuberculosis pathophysiology that is underreported is the
development of disseminated infection and bacteraemia.
It is known that M. bovis infection in an animal can have
a number of possible outcomes ranging from elimina-
tion, self-limiting infection, localized lesions or a life-
threatening systemic disease. The immune response
following challenge is known to be complex, with variable
responses occurring during natural infections with low
numbers of organisms.5 Bacteraemia occurs during post-
primary dissemination in humans and it has been
reported, although rarely, in cattle.6 Recently a study in
India reported the culture of M. bovis in the blood of
apparently healthy cattle, which suggested M. bovis may

 be circulating in the blood of sub-clinically infected ani-
mals at higher levels than expected.7 The paucity of infor-
mation concerning this aspect of the disease means that it
is not known whether bacteraemia will ultimately lead to
active infection or clearance, nor how a positive SCCIT
test result relates to the potential for bacteraemia.
Bacteriophage amplification technology was developed
20 y ago as a method to rapidly detect and enumerate slow
growing pathogenic mycobacteria.8 In addition it can be
used as a tool to rapidly detect antibiotic resistance9 and to
investigate mycobacterial dormancy.10 The assay detects
the growth of broad host range mycobacteriophage, capable
of infecting a wide range of both pathogenic and non-
pathogenic mycobacteria. As the phage is specific for
members of the Mycobacterium genus, and can only
successfully replicate within a viable cell, a positive test
result (a plaque) indicates the presence of viable mycobacte-
rial cells in the original sample. The specificity of the detec-
tion event is then achieved by amplification of signature
sequences from the plaque following the phage assay (see
Fig. 1;11). In contrast, direct PCR will detect DNA from
both viable and non-viable cells and can be inhibited by
components in the blood.12 The combined phage-PCR
method has been shown to be able to detect and enumerate
Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) in a
range of matrices such as milk, cheese and blood,11,13,14 but
detection of M. bovis in clinical samples using this approach
has not been described before.
It was already known that the phage-PCR assay could
be used to sensitively detect M. bovis cells from liquid
Figure 1. Schematic of the bacteriophage amplification assay. To perform the phage assay, the mycobacteria first need to be isolated
from the sample. In all these experiments PBMCs were purified and suspended in supplemented 7H9 medium that lyses the PBMCs and
promotes efficient phage infection: Step 1: Isolated mycobacteria are incubated with phage D29 for 1 h to allow virus infection of myco-
bacterial cells present in the sample. Step 2: Extracellular phage that have not infected bacterial cells are inactivated by virucide. Step 3:
Virucide is neutralized and fast-growing M. smegmatis are added to the sample which will form the bacterial lawn. Step 4: Samples are
plated in soft agar and incubated overnight permitting lawn formation by M. smegmatisC. Phage released from the infected mycobac-
terial cells present in the original sample are released and infect the M. smegmatis cells resulting in the formation of plaques. Step 5:
Plates are inspected for plaques which indicate detection of a mycobacterial cell in the original sample. If plaques are present, DNA is
extracted from the agar and presence of MTC bacteria is determined by RPA/PCR.

 cultures15 and that this method can be used to detect
MAP cells in clinical blood samples.16 The aim of these
experiments was to design and optimise a phage-PCR
method to allow detection of M. bovis cells in blood and
to determine whether it could detect mycobacteria in
SCCIT-positive animals.
Materials and methods
Bacterial strains, bacteriophage and growth media
M. bovis BCG (Glaxo) was used to optimise the phage-
PCR assay. Cells were cultured and maintained on Mid-
dlebrook 7H10 agar supplemented with OADC (Becton
Dickenson, UK) without glycerol and liquid cultures
were prepared in Middlebrook 7H9 media (Becton
Dickenson, UK) containing OADC. When performing
the phage assay the media was supplemented with CaCl2
(2 mM final concentration; Sigma, UK). All cultures
were grown at 37�C without shaking to prevent clump-
ing. For the phage assays the Mycobacterium smegmatis
strain used was mc2155 (Lab21 Ltd, UK) and the bacteri-
ophage used was D29 (Lab21 Ltd, UK).
Bacteriophage amplification assay
The phage assay (Fig. 1) and experimental controls were
carried out as previously described.15,16 Briefly, samples
(1 ml) were mixed with bacteriophage D29 (100 ml; 1 £
108 pfu) in supplemented 7H9 Media and incubated for
1 h to allow the phage to infect any mycobacteria present
in the sample. Phage that had not infected a host cell
were then inactivated using a virucide (100 ml ferrous
ammonium sulfate; final concentration 10 mM; Lab21
Ltd, UK). Samples were mixed thoroughly ensuring all
sides of the container are covered and incubated for
5 min at room temperature. One ml of M. smegmatis
cells (to form the bacterial lawn) was added to the sample
which was plated in 7H10 agar (0.75 % final agar concen-
tration). As experimental controls, a 1 ml sample con-
taining approx. One £ 103 cfu ml¡1 M. smegmatis cells
or 1 ml of medium alone were used as positive and nega-
tive controls, respectively for the phage assays. Plaques
formed at the end of the assay were counted and the
number taken to represent the number of cells that could
be detected by the phage in the sample.
Molecular identification of M. tuberculosis complex
cells
The identity of the mycobacterial cell detected was deter-
mined by extracting DNA from the center of plaques (a
maximum of 5) using agarose gel-DNA extraction
columns (ZymoResearch, UK).16 For PCR detection of
MTC DNA,
the IS6110 PCR
assay
described by
Eisenach17 was used. In a 25 ml reaction volume, 1 mM
of each primer was used with HotStarTaq Plus Master
Mix Kit (Qiagen, UK). The PCR cycle conditions were
95�C for 5 min followed by 30 cycles of 95�C for 30s,
68�C for 30 s and 72�C for 1 min and a final extension at
72�C for 7 min. Either IS6110 or IS108118 was targeted
for RPA detection using lyophilised reagents (TwistDx
Ltd, UK). These were rehydrated using 37.5 mL Twist-
Amp Resuspension Buffer and 4 mL of 280 mM MgOAc.
Template DNA (8.5 mL) was added to this and samples
were incubated for 30 min at 39�C. DNA extracted from
M. bovis BCG and sterile water were used as positive and
negative controls, respectively. Amplified RPA products
of approximately 220 bp were visualised using agarose
gel DNA electrophoresis.
To determine the sensitivity of the RPA assay, agar
extracted from M. bovis BCG plaques was mixed with
agar extracted from plaques formed using the non-
pathogen M. smegmatis. The number of M. bovis plaques
added varied between 1 and 5, with the total number of
plaques per sample being made up to 5 in each case using
M. smegmatis plaques. DNA samples extracted from
these mixtures were then subsequently tested using
either the PCR or RPA assays described above.
Blood samples, preparation and isolation of
peripheral blood mononuclear cells
For method optimisation experiments commercial hepari-
nised sheep blood (Oxoid, UK) was used. The number of
M. bovis BCG cells in laboratory cultures was enumerated
using the bacteriophage assay as described above (data
reported as pfu.ml¡1)8 and then cells diluted in PBS (105 to
10 pfu ml¡1). To allow uptake of bacterial cells by
leukocytes the method of 19 was used. Briefly 1 ml of cell
suspension was added to 9 ml fresh (< 1 d old) heparinised
sheep blood and samples incubated at 37�C on a rotating
mixer for 4 h. After the uptake period, PBMCs were iso-
lated from 2 ml blood using Ficoll-Paque Plus in Leucosep
tubes (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, UK). The purified
PBMC’s were then lysed by osmotic shock by addition of
supplemented 7H9 media to release any internalised bacte-
ria. The phage assay was then performed to detect myco-
bacteria released from the PBMCs as described above.11
Clinical blood samples from the SCCIT-positive cattle
were obtained directly after slaughter by a veterinary sur-
geon in the abattoir. These were Holstein cows from a
farm in the South West of the UK within the High Risk
zone. Blood samples from the control animals were
obtained from a closed Holstein beef herd in a non-TB
endemic area of the UK provided as superfluous material

 as part of an on-going herd health screening program
under the Veterinary Surgeons Act. The study protocol
was approved by the University of Nottingham, School
of Veterinary Medicine and Science ethical review
panel prior to sample usage. Blood was collected in
Vacutainer heparin tubes (Becton Dickenson) and 2 ml
samples used for the isolation of the PBMCs which were
tested using the phage assay using the same method
described above.
Statistical analysis
Excel 2010 statistical add on package was used to initially
determine whether the data were distributed normally or
not, then GraphPad Prism was used for performing
ANOVAs and post-hoc tests to determine significant differ-
ences in the data. Significance was determined at p < 0.05.
Results
Development of phage-PCR method for detection of
M. bovis BCG in blood
An experiment was performed to determine whether the
phage assay could also be used to detect M. bovis BCG
cells present inside PBMCs but using a published
method that allows mycobacteria to be taken up by leu-
kocytes.18,19 When using this method, if no incubation
time is allowed for uptake, no mycobacteria are detected
in the buffy coat layer demonstrating that the bacteria do
not co-purify with the PBMCs (Table 1). When 105 M.
bovis BCG cells were added to the blood, the number of
plaques detected in the PBMC fraction was uncountable,
indicating that the purified PBMCs contained more than
103 cells (Table 1). As the number of cells added to the
blood was decreased, the number of plaques recorded in
each sample also decreased until the number of cells
detected in the PBMC fraction reached countable levels.
This occurred when approximately 102 M. bovis BCG
cells were added to the blood, at which point 65 (§13 )
plaques were recorded (Table 1) indicating an efficiency
of uptake of the M. bovis BCG cells of at least 50%. If less
than 10 M. bovis BCG cells were added to the sample, no
cells were detected using the phage assay and this is con-
sistent with the results gained when this method was
used for the internalisation of MAP.19 Given the effi-
ciency of uptake, it was assumed that the limit of detec-
tion of this method was approximately 10 cells per
sample. However it could be lower than this when natu-
rally infected samples are tested since the cells are
already internalised.
Molecular identification of M. tuberculosis complex
DNA
Previously we have used PCR to detect the MAP signa-
ture genetic elements present in DNA extracted from
individual plaques,14,15 hence this approach was also
applied here and the IS6110 MTC signature sequence
was amplified by PCR using a published method.17
When the sample was composed of DNA extracted from
5 plaques arising from the detection of M. bovis BCG
cells, the PCR assay was routinely able to detect the
IS6110 element (data not shown). However when the
number of M. bovis BCG plaques varying between 1 and
5, was tested (Table 2), it was found that the PCR assay
could not consistently detect the IS6110 genetic element

 when only one or 2 M. bovis BCG plaques were present
in the sample, suggesting that the PCR assay was not sen-
sitive enough for reliable detection of low amounts of
DNA. This is consistent with our observations when
developing an assay for MAP, where it was found that a
nested PCR more consistently detected low concentra-
tions of IS900 in samples that only contained one MAP-
positive plaque.16
To improve the sensitivity of the molecular detection
event, PCR amplification was replaced with DNA ampli-
fication using a published isothermal RPA method.18
Using this method, both the IS6110 and IS1081 MTC sig-
nature sequences were always detected from DNA sam-
ples that contained the DNA extracted from 5 M. bovis
BCG plaques. However, only the RPA IS6110 primers
were able to consistently amplify MTC DNA when agar
was extracted from one M. bovis BCG plaque mixed with
4 M. smegmatis plaques (Table 2). Thus the RPA method
using the IS6110 primers was chosen for use for further
experiments.
Detection of viable M. tuberculosis complex cells in
clinical blood samples
Blood samples were obtained from 41 SCCIT-positive ani-
mals after slaughter and the optimised phage-RPA
method was used to detect any viable MTC cells present
in the sample. As a control 45 blood samples from cattle
in herds with no previous history of M. bovis infection
were also tested. From the 45 SCCIT-negative samples, 6
produced plaques (range D 1–11 per 2 ml blood; mean D
3.1), however none of these gave a positive IS6110 RPA
result (Table 3) indicating that no MTC DNA was
detected in these samples. We have previously reported
that the phage assay will produce low numbers of plaques
from samples that do not give a positive result when
interrogated using PCR.15 However the plaque number in
these samples is always low as seen here.
Within the SCCIT-positive group, 31 produced pla-
ques. After DNA extraction, 27 of these samples pro-
duced a positive IS6110 RPA result (Table 4) indicating
that DNA from MTC bacteria was present. At post mor-
tem 32 % (13/41) of the SCCIT-positive animals had visi-
ble lesions (VL; 3 Multiple, 10 Diffuse). Of the animals in
the VL group, 85 % (11/13) had detectable mycobacter-
aemia based on the phage-RPA results (Table 4; Fig. 2).
In samples from NVL animals only 57% (16/28) had
detectable levels of MTC mycobacteria in their blood
(Fig. 2). No post mortem results were available for the
negative control group, as blood samples were taken
from healthy animals.
Since the phage assay detects individual mycobacte-
rial cells, the number of plaques detected is indicative of
the microbial load in the blood sample. In the SCCIT-
positive VL group, the average number of cells detected
in phage-RPA positive samples was 30.4 (range D 8–63
pfu per 2 ml blood; Fig. 3). For the SCCIT-positive NVL
group, the average number of cells detected in RPA-
positive samples was 16.3 (range D 2–43 pfu per 2 ml
blood; Fig. 3) and this number is significantly lower
than the number of mycobacterial cells detected in the
VL samples (p < 0.05) suggesting that the VL animals
had a higher microbial load in the blood. Within the
NVL group, the average plaque number for MTC-
negative samples (phage-negative or phage positive,
RPA-negative) was 2.3 (range D 0–16; Fig. 3) and this
number was also significantly lower (p < 0.05) than the
plaque number for the NVL-MTC positive samples
(Fig. 3).

 Discussion
The bacteriophage-based detection method used here
was originally developed as a commercial assay for the
detection of human M. tuberculosis infections,20 however
more recently it has been shown to be a useful tool for
the investigation of animal mycobacterial infections,
such as Johne’s disease.13,16 Combining phage-based
detection with PCR-based identification methods allows
both live/dead differentiation (the phage can only repli-
cate in a viable cell) and also increases the sensitivity of
PCR-based detection methods because the plaques
formed allow efficient targeting of the genomic DNA
released from individual cells which is preserved in the
agar. The IS6110 genetic element, although not specific
for M. bovis, is extremely useful as a target for any DNA-
based detection method, as it is present in multiple cop-
ies in the genome, allowing more sensitive detection of
single cells. Although components of the PBMC fraction
does not affect the phage-based assay, RPA was chosen
as an alternative DNA amplification method since it is
reported to be less susceptible to inhibition by blood,21
and in this study the RPA detection of low concentra-
tions of IS6110 was found to be more reproducible than
PCR-based
amplification
of
the
same
signature
sequences.
As we found that MAP cells were primarily located in
the PBMCs of MAP-infected cattle,16 we hypothesized
that this may also be true for cattle suffering from M.
bovis infection. Hence for this study the SCCIT-positive
cattle were chosen simply to determine whether myco-
bacteraemia could be detected in the blood of these ani-
mals using the phage-RPA method. The fact that we
detected viable MTC cells in the blood of 26 of the 41
animals tested is extremely interesting and demonstrates
that SCCIT reactor animals (i.e those identified as
infected by M. bovis) commonly contain detectable levels
of viable mycobacteria within PBMCs. Although there is
a lack of other reports describing the detection of M.
bovis in the blood of cattle (apart from one study in
19776), there are many publications that have demon-
strated the detection of mycobacteria in blood for
humans suffering from human tuberculosis by both cul-
ture and PCR.22,23
In this study we have not used a signature sequence
that is specific for M. bovis, rather we targeted the IS6110
element which is specific for the MTC group of which
M. bovis is a member. Targeting this well-characterized
genetic element allows rapid and sensitive detection
which can be routinely used for a variety of applications,
making the IS6110 genetic element a useful target despite
the lack of specificity. Nonetheless as all the animals
tested were SCCIT test positive, and M. bovis was cul-
tured from some samples from this outbreak sent to the
UK veterinary diagnostic laboratories (D Brewer, APHA
pers. comm.), it is a reasonable interpretation of the
results gained in this study that the cells detected in these
samples were M. bovis. While this is true in the UK,
other members of the MTC may be detected using this
method in countries where M. bovis is not prevalent.
Interestingly none of the samples from control animals
gave a positive result with the IS6110 RPA assay, but it
must also be noted these samples were obtained from
live animals rather than at slaughter which may have
influenced our results gained. Samples from 6 of these
animals produce plaques and this may be due to the
presence of a different type of mycobacterial cell, such as
MAP, which is also widespread within UK cattle popula-
tions.16 In this study we did not test the samples for the
presence of other mycobacterial signature sequences, but
this result emphasizes the fact that when using the

 phage-based detection method amplification of signature
sequences to confirm the identity of the cell detected is
essential for accurate interpretation of plaque results. In
future studies it will be interesting to include more spe-
cific M. bovis signature sequences as well as developing
multiplex DNA amplification assays such as we have pre-
viously described14 to allow simultaneous detection of
different mycobacterial species.
Of the 41 SCCIT-positive samples tested, only 13 had
visible lesions, suggesting these animals had an advanced
stage of infection and MTC cells were not detected in
blood samples from only 2 of these. This may have been
because there was low bacterial load in these blood sam-
ples which was not detectable by the phage assay. How-
ever the overall pattern of results is consistent with the
idea that animals with visible lesions have a more dis-
seminated infection and therefore perhaps it is not sur-
prising to find that M. bovis cells are actively replicating
inside the PBMCs (phage D29 can only productively
infect actively growing cells10). It is also known that the
sensitivity of identifying lesions at post-mortem is low,24
which may explain why 57% of the NVLs also had
detectable levels of viable mycobacteria in their blood.
Despite this, there was a significantly lower number of
plaques detected in the MTC-positive NVL samples than
was detected in MTC-positive VL animals indicating a
lower microbial load in this group of animals. This may
reflect the ability of the phage assay to detect early stages
of infection in some animals, but further studies on ani-
mals in the early stages of infection are required to sup-
port this conclusion.
The level of mycobacteraemia in animals suffering
from M. bovis infection is underreported due to the
difficulties associated with culturing M. bovis from
clinical samples, and therefore this aspect of the dis-
ease is not well understood. In human tuberculosis
and in other mycobacterial diseases, mycobacteraemia
is considered as one of the potentially most useful
approaches
to
definitively
diagnose
tuberculosis.23
However culturing these organisms is very slow,
expensive and insensitive, which limits the use of
culture as a Gold Standard when investigating and
detecting
infectious
diseases.25
Although,
several
research groups have detected mycobacteraemia using
extraction of DNA and direct PCR, it is not certain
whether the DNA detected came from a viable cell or
whether PCR inhibitors in blood limit the detection
event.26 The fact that the phage-RPA method could
rapidly and sensitively detect and enumerate viable
mycobacterial cells in clinical blood samples, providing
results within 48 h, means that it could be used to
increase our understanding of M. bovis infections.
Although parallel testing with culture is needed, the
phage assay may also aid the confirmation of BTB
infection in NVL cattle without the need for extended
culture of samples. The blood from the SCCIT test
positive reactor animals was obtained from animals
directly after slaughter which may have impacted our
finding compared to obtained samples from live ani-
mals. To this end it would be interesting to know
whether intermediate or non-SCCIT reactor animals
from an infected herd harbour mycobacteria in their
blood in live animals, and whether this relates to the
probability of their progression to SCCIT-positive sta-
tus. Hence the phage-RPA provides a useful tool for
monitoring levels of mycobacteraemia in relation to
the animals’ immune response to disease, especially
during vaccine trials and will enable researchers to ask
clinically important questions to further the under-
standing of this extremely difficult to control disease.
Conclusion
Here we show that the phage-RPA method can be
applied to provide rapid, sensitive and specific detection
of MTC cells in clinical blood samples. The finding that
a number of SCCIT-positive animals with detectable
levels of viable MTC cells present in these initial trial
results were both encouraging and surprising, in particu-
lar the relationship seen between mycobacterial load in
the blood and the animals’ lesion status. More work is
now required to develop species-specific RPA assays and
to establish what sample volume is required to ensure
sensitive detection of low levels of bacteria. In addition,
studies specifically designed to investigate exactly how
bacteraemia
relates
to
disseminated
infection
are
required.
