Investigation performed at the University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, the Netherlands
Background: In soccer, although hamstring flexibility is thought to play a major role in preventing hamstring injuries, the relation-
ship between hamstring flexibility and hamstring injuries remains unclear.
Purpose: To investigate the relationship between hamstring flexibility and hamstring injuries in male amateur soccer players.
Study Design: Case-control study; Level of evidence, 3.
Methods: This study included 450 male first-class amateur soccer players (mean age, 24.5 years). Hamstring flexibility was mea-
sured by performing the sit-and-reach test (SRT). The relationship between hamstring flexibility and the occurrence of hamstring
injuries in the following year, while adjusting for the possible confounding effects of age and previous hamstring injuries, was
determined with a multivariate logistic regression analysis.
Results: Of the 450 soccer players, 21.8% reported a hamstring injury in the previous year. The mean (6SD) baseline score for
the SRT was 21.2 6 9.2 cm. During the 1-year follow-up period, 23 participants (5.1%) suffered a hamstring injury. In the mul-
tivariate analysis, while adjusting for age and previous injuries, no significant relationship was found between hamstring flexibility
and hamstring injuries (P = .493).
Conclusion: In this group of soccer players, hamstring flexibility (measured with the SRT) was not related to hamstring injuries.
Age and previous hamstring injuries as possible confounders did not appear to influence this relationship. Other etiological factors
need to be examined to further elucidate the mechanism of hamstring injuries.

Soccer is the most frequently played sport worldwide, with
about 265 million registered and unregistered players. Play-
ing soccer is supposed to be beneficial for health because
regular exercise during sport generally reduces the risk of
many diseases.18,19 However, this statement is challenged
by the relatively high risk of injuries among soccer players.
In 2013, about 850,000 injuries were reported among the 1.4
million registered soccer players in the Netherlands.20
Hamstring injuries in male amateur soccer players are
responsible for 15.9% of all injuries.29 In players suffering
from a hamstring injury, long-term absence from sport, or
even an early end of a sport career, is reported.9 In addition,
the risk of recurrences is 16.2%, which is above the average
rate compared with other types of sport injuries.17,29 In soc-
cer players, hamstring flexibility is often measured to deter-
mine the risk of incurring a hamstring injury and to decide
whether exercises are needed to increase hamstring flexibil-
ity.24 However, the relationship between hamstring flexibil-
ity and hamstring injuries remains unclear.
A hamstring injury is defined as a muscle or tendon
injury of the semitendinosus muscle, semimembranosus
muscle, or biceps femoris muscle, which prevents a player
from taking full part in soccer training or matches.34 Var-
ious nonmodifiable risk factors for hamstring injuries in
soccer players have been identified, including increased
age and at least 1 previous hamstring injury.12,30 Limited

 hamstring flexibility is a potential modifiable risk factor
related to a hamstring injury.33
Clark7 reported that flexibility of the hamstring muscles
plays a major role in sprint-type hamstring injuries, which
are the most frequently occurring hamstring injuries in soc-
cer. In the late swing phase of a sprint, with the knee at or
near full extension, the hamstring muscles are stretched
and endure a maximum peak force between 85% and 95%
of the gait cycle. Consequently, when the hamstring
muscles are at a (sub)maximum length during the sprint,
a considerable force will be endured.6 A player with limited
hamstring flexibility is therefore assumed to be at a higher
risk for an injury during a sprint than a player who has
more flexible hamstring muscles. However, the evidence
for a relationship between hamstring flexibility and ham-
string injuries is conflicting.2,11,33
Two important risk factors for hamstring injuries are age
and previous hamstring injuries. Increasing age can cause
a loss of muscle mass, a reduction in skeletal muscle fiber
size, a number of muscle fibers, and denervation of muscle
fibers, which can result in decreased hamstring flexibility
and an increased risk for hamstring injuries.14 According to
Gabbe et al,15 a previous hamstring injury can result in
increased hamstring flexibility but also an increased risk
for hamstring injuries. Therefore, because both risk factors
are related to the risk of hamstring injuries and hamstring
flexibility, age and previous hamstring injuries are possible
confounders in the relationship between hamstring flexibility
and hamstring injuries. Because of these confounders, the
relationship between hamstring flexibility and hamstring
injuries may have been overestimated in previous studies.33
Therefore, to verify our hypothesis, we investigated the
relationship between hamstring flexibility and hamstring
injuries, after adjusting for confounders, in male amateur
soccer players.
METHODS
Design
This prospective study was part of the Hamstring Injury Pre-
vention Strategies (HIPS) study and was carried out in close
collaboration with the Royal Netherlands Football Association
(KNVB). The Medical Ethics Committee of the University
Medical Center Utrecht approved the study (No. 12-575/C).
The design of the HIPS study has already been published.32
The aim of the HIPS study is 2-fold. First, a randomized
controlled trial was performed to study the effect of the Nor-
dic hamstring exercise (an eccentric exercise added to regu-
lar soccer training) on the occurrence and prevention of
hamstring injuries in amateur soccer players.31 Second,
the present study examined whether limited flexibility of
the hamstring muscles is associated with an increased
risk of hamstring injuries.
Participants
During October and November 2012, all male first-class
amateur soccer teams in the Netherlands (districts West
1, West 2, South 1, and East) were invited to participate
in the HIPS study. These teams play at high-level amateur
soccer competitions with 1 or sometimes 2 matches per
week and 2 to 3 training sessions per week. Players of
these teams who were aged 18 to 40 years and who agreed
to participate were eligible for inclusion in the HIPS study.
All participants received an information letter providing
details on the aim of this study, the hamstring flexibility
test, and data collection. After receiving the letter, all par-
ticipants were asked to provide informed consent. Exclu-
sion criteria for this study were (1) being absent during
the measurement of hamstring flexibility in January
2013, (2) being unable to perform the hamstring flexibility
test correctly for any reason, or (3) suffering from a current
hamstring injury.
Measurements
Player Characteristics. Player characteristics were col-
lected using a questionnaire that was filled in by all partic-
ipants at baseline of the HIPS study in January 2013. The
questionnaire included questions on age, years of soccer
experience, field position, and hamstring injuries in the
year before the study.
Hamstring Flexibility. To measure hamstring flexibil-
ity, all participants performed the sit-and-reach test
(SRT) supervised by a member of the medical staff of the
soccer team. The SRT is a reliable and valid test to esti-
mate hamstring flexibility.3,16,23 In this study, participants
performed the SRT according to the protocol described by
Ayala et al.4 No warm-up was allowed before testing. Dur-
ing the test, the participant was sitting on the floor with
the knees extended and the legs together. The soles of
the bare feet were placed against the foot panel of the
SRT box. The hands were placed on top of each other
with the palms facing downwards and then pushing the
reach indicator on the box as far as possible along the mea-
suring scale. The examiner placed his hands on the knees
of the participant to keep the knees extended. The maxi-
mum score had to be maintained for at least 2 seconds.
The score on the SRT was defined as the amount of centi-
meters that the participant was able to reach on the box
and was registered by a member of the medical staff of
Figure 1. The sit-and-reach test.

When it was impossible for a participant to reach the zero
mark on the box, the score on the test was 0 cm.
Diagnosis of Hamstring Injury. The medical staff mem-
bers of the soccer teams were instructed to diagnose ham-
string injuries according to the consensus statement of
Fuller et al13: ââAny physical complaint affecting the poste-
rior side of the upper leg, irrespective of the need for med-
ical attention or time loss from soccer activities.ââ
Procedure
Before the start of this study, the researchers instructed
the medical staff of all participating teams on how to per-
form the SRT and how to diagnose a hamstring injury
according
to
the
above-mentioned
definition.
These
instructions were provided 2 to 6 weeks before the start
of the study in January 2013 during meetings in all 4 of
the participating districts. In that month, which is midsea-
son, immediately after the winter break in the Dutch ama-
teur
soccer
season,
the
medical
staff
performed
measurements of hamstring flexibility in all participating
players. In the Netherlands, high-level amateur soccer
teams generally have a physical therapist present at all
matches and training sessions. Occasionally, a sport mas-
sage therapist is present at matches and training, with
a physical therapist available for additional consulting in
case of any injury. During the 1-year period, the medical
staff registered each hamstring injury of the participating
players of their team using a special injury registration
form and an injury recovery form. The registration form
included questions on the mechanism of the injury in
terms of ââduring a sprintââ or ââlanding after a jump,ââ loca-
tion of the injury, and date of the injury. The recovery
form included a question on how long the player was
absent from training and matches. If a player was trans-
ferred to another team during the year, thereby making
registration by the medical staff impossible, the research-
ers periodically contacted the individual players by tele-
phone about possible hamstring injuries.
Statistical Analysis
The minimal required sample size for the present study
was calculated based on the formula of Peduzzi et al.25 A
sample of at least 300 participants was required. In this
calculation, 1 risk factor, 2 possible confounding variables,
and a 10.0% risk of a hamstring injury per year were
assumed. This hamstring injury risk was based on a previ-
ous study with a similar sample.29
Descriptive statistics were used for baseline character-
istics. For player characteristics, age and years of soccer
experience (means 6 SDs) were calculated. Players with
a previous hamstring injury were presented in percen-
tages. Also, field positions were presented in percentages.
The mean score of the SRT was calculated for all partic-
ipants. Then, the mean scores for different subgroups,
based on age and previous hamstring injuries, were calcu-
lated. Players were first divided into 2 equal age categories
based on the median age. An independent-samples t test
was used to investigate significant differences (P \ .05)
in hamstring flexibility between the 2 age categories. Sec-
ond, 2 categories related to the history of hamstring inju-
ries were formed: participants with and participants
without a hamstring injury in the year before the study.
An independent-samples t test was used to investigate sig-
nificant differences (P \ .05) in hamstring flexibility
between these 2 categories.
The distribution of hamstring injuries in the previously
mentioned categories of age and previous hamstring inju-
ries was calculated and analyzed by using the chi-square
analysis. Of all hamstring injuries, the percentage of inju-
ries related to a sprint (according to the injury form) was
calculated. Also, the mean absence from training and
matches (according to the recovery form) was calculated.
To study the relationship between hamstring flexibility
as an independent variable and the occurrence of ham-
string injuries as a dependent variable, a univariate logis-
tic regression analysis was used. The possible confounding
variables, age (as a continuous variable) and previous
hamstring injuries, were also analyzed in univariate logis-
tic regression to investigate whether these variables might
be related to hamstring injuries. To investigate the rela-
tionship, after adjusting for the possible confounding
effects of age and previous hamstring injuries, a multivari-
ate logistic regression analysis was performed. The enter
method was used to create a model that included all varia-
bles including the possible confounders. Flexibility was
considered a significant predictor when P \ .05 in the mul-
tivariate logistic regression analysis. All analyses were
performed with the Statistical Package of Social Sciences,
version 20.0, for Windows (SPSS Inc).
RESULTS
Inclusion of Participants
In total, 621 amateur soccer players participated in the
HIPS study. Of all participants, 96 were excluded because
they reported a current hamstring injury or did not report
their current status. Also, 75 participants did not perform
the SRT correctly at baseline and were also excluded.
Finally, 450 participants who met the inclusion criteria
were included in the present study.
Participant Characteristics
The characteristics of the included participants are sum-
marized in Table 1. The mean (6SD) age of the partici-
pants was 24.5 6 3.7 years. The mean years of soccer
experience of the participants was 18.1 6 4.1 years. In
the year before the study, 98 (21.8%) participants reported
a hamstring injury.
Hamstring Flexibility
The mean scores for hamstring flexibility as measured on
the SRT are presented in Table 2. The overall mean score
for hamstring flexibility was 21.2 6 9.2 cm. The players

 were equally divided regarding their age into 2 categories,
with 23.9 years as a cutoff point. No significant differences
were found in the mean SRT score between the groups on
age (P = .105) and previous injuries (P = .436) (Table 2).
Also, years of soccer experience and field position were
not significantly related to hamstring flexibility.
Hamstring Injuries
During the study period, 23 hamstring injuries were reported,
which resulted in a hamstring injury rate of 5.1%. There was
no significant relationship between the category of age and
hamstring injuries (P = .134) and the category of previous
hamstring injuries and hamstring injuries (P = .305) as ana-
lyzed with the chi-square analysis (Table 3). Additionally,
years of soccer experience and field position were also not sig-
nificantly related to hamstring injuries. In 17 cases (73.9%),
the hamstring injury was related to a sprint of the participant.
The mean absence from soccer training and matches caused
by the injury was 35.0 6 25.7 days.
Logistic Regression
In the univariate analysis, hamstring flexibility showed no
significant relationship with hamstring injuries (P = .496)
(Table 4). Adding the 2 possible confounders (age and a pre-
vious hamstring injury) in the multivariate analysis did
not influence the level of significance (P = .493) (Table 4).
Age and previous hamstring injuries were not significantly
related to hamstring injuries in both the univariate analy-
sis (P = .176 and .309, respectively) and multivariate anal-
ysis (P = .150 and .285, respectively).
DISCUSSION
The most important finding of our study was that a rela-
tionship between hamstring flexibility (as estimated by
the SRT) and hamstring injuries was not found in male
amateur soccer players. Adjustments for confounding by
age and previous hamstring injuries did not influence
these results. As far as we know, this is the first study to
focus on the relationship between hamstring flexibility
and hamstring injuries that also adjusted for possible con-
founding variables (age and previous hamstring injuries).
In this study, the mean score on the SRT (21.2 cm) is
similar to those in 2 earlier studies in which mean scores
of 23.5 and 22.8 cm, respectively, were reported in recrea-
tional active male participants (mean age, 23.6 and 22.9
years, respectively).8,22 The hamstring injury rate (5.1%)
was lower than the hamstring injury rate in the previous
year (21.8%). This could possibly be explained by the fact
that the hamstring injury rate of the previous year was cal-
culated based on the registration forms of the participants,
which are retrospective data. This is contrary to the col-
lected data of the hamstring injuries during the study
period, which are prospective data. Underregistration of
minimal injuries by the medical staff during the study
period could be a possible explanation. However, the ham-
string injury rate in the present study was also slightly
lower than that in an earlier prospective study in amateur
soccer players in the Netherlands in which the same defi-
nition of a hamstring injury was used (10.0%),29 lower
than that in a study of professional soccer players in Den-
mark (12.3%),26 and much lower than that in a large study
of hamstring injuries in professional soccer players in
Europe (21.8%).10 A possible explanation for this difference
in injury rates may be the Nordic hamstring exercise,
which is a 13-week training program performed in the
period immediately after measurements of hamstring flex-
ibility are taken. This intervention was part of the HIPS
study and was shown to be effective in preventing ham-
string injuries.31 This could have reduced the number of
hamstring injuries in this prospective study.

 Similar to our results, Arnason et al2 and Engebretsen
et al11 did not find a relationship between hamstring flexi-
bility and hamstring injuries. In both these Norwegian
studies, the passive knee extension test (PKET) was used
to measure hamstring flexibility. However, opposite results
were reported by Witvrouw et al,33 who concluded that lim-
ited hamstring flexibility increased the risk of hamstring
injuries,
albeit
the
difference
in
hamstring
flexibility
between injured/uninjured players in that study was small.
To measure hamstring flexibility, they used the straight-leg
raise test (SLRT). The differences in the tests used to mea-
sure hamstring flexibility might explain the aberrant find-
ings of the study of Witvrouw et al33 when compared with
our study and the Norwegian studies.2,11
Both the SLRT and PKET are clinical tests that can be
performed best by health care professionals.1 No validation
studies can be found that have investigated the validity or
reliability of the PKET. Although the SLRT is considered
the ââgold standardââ for measuring hamstring flexibility,
evidence for the validity of this test is also lacking. There-
fore, in our study, the SRT was used to measure hamstring
flexibility. The use of the SRT has both negative and posi-
tive aspects. Although the reliability of the SRT is high, the
score on the test is known to be influenced by lumbar and
thoracic flexibility of the participants. Thus, the hamstring
flexibility score on the SRT can be slightly underestimated
or overestimated.23,27 However, because the SRT is an
easy-to-perform field test, in our opinion, this test is
more applicable for the medical staff of an amateur soccer
team. The SRT can be performed in a more standardized
way than other hamstring flexibility tests, which reduces
the risk of compensation and less accuracy.
The rationale for the hypothesis that hamstring flexibil-
ity and hamstring injuries are related is found in the kine-
matic process of the sprint in which the hamstrings endure
high forces in a stretched position. The hamstring muscles
lengthen 50% to 90% of the gait cycle during a sprint.6,28
However, there is no supporting evidence that the ham-
strings are maximally stretched during the last swing
phase in a sprint. In speeds ranging from 80% to 100% of
the maximal sprint, no variation in muscular tendon
stretch of the hamstrings seems to occur. This is in con-
trast to the muscular tendon force of the hamstrings,
which increases significantly in speeds ranging from 80%
to 100% of a maximal sprint.5 Therefore, during a sprint,
it may not be the reduced hamstring flexibility that is
responsible for a hamstring injury but the reduced eccen-
tric hamstring strength of a soccer player.21,28
Some methodological limitations of this study need to be
addressed. First, the staff of the amateur soccer teams diag-
nosed players with a hamstring injury. Generally, the staff
consists of sports massagers (nonprofessionals in sports
medicine) or physical therapists. Although the staff was
well instructed by the researchers on how to diagnose ham-
string injuries before the study, the diagnosis of a hamstring
injury was not confirmed by a physician. A registration form
was used to verify the hamstring injury. Other medical con-
ditions that can cause posterior pain of the upper leg, for
example, referred pain from the lower back or adductor-
related injuries, could therefore be excluded. Second, all
types of hamstring injuries were recorded, although it was
hypothesized that hamstring flexibility might be related to
sprint-type hamstring injuries. It was not possible for the
staff of the amateur soccer teams to identify the specific
sprint-type injuries. However, on the injury form, the play-
ers reported that more than 70% of the injuries was related
to a sprint, indicating that sprint-type injuries were the
most common hamstring injuries in the present study.
CONCLUSION
The present study shows that hamstring flexibility (as esti-
mated with the SRT) is not related to hamstring injuries.
The possible confounders of age and previous hamstring
injuries do not influence this relationship. Consequently,
our results suggest that it is not possible to identify players
at risk for hamstring injuries by measuring their ham-
string flexibility.
