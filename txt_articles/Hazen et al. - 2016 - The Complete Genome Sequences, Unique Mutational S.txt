SUMMARY
Somatic mutation in neurons is linked to neurologic
disease and implicated in cell-type diversification.
However, the origin, extent, and patterns of genomic
mutation in neurons remain unknown. We established
a nuclear transfer method to clonally amplify the ge-
nomes of neurons from adult mice for whole-genome
sequencing. Comprehensive mutation detection and
independent validation revealed that individual neu-
rons harbor �100 unique mutations from all classes
but lack recurrent rearrangements. Most neurons
contain at least one gene-disrupting mutation and
rare (0–2) mobile element insertions. The frequency
and gene bias of neuronal mutations differ from other
lineages, potentially due to novel mechanisms gov-
erning postmitotic mutation. Fertile mice were cloned
from several neurons, establishing the compatibility
of mutated adult neuronal genomes with reprogram-
ming to pluripotency and development.
INTRODUCTION
The genome sequence of a differentiated cell offers a record of
the mutational events that occur during its specification, matura-
tion, function, and dysfunction. For example, whole-genome
sequencing (WGS) of cancer cells has identified distinct muta-
tional signatures that characterize different tumors, raising ques-
tions about the extent to which these signatures originate from
cell-type-specific somatic mutations, differential exposure to
mutagens, or impaired genome maintenance due to transforma-
tion (Alexandrov et al., 2013; Lawrence et al., 2013; Pleasance
et al., 2010a, 2010b). In addition, somatic mutations are
becoming increasingly recognized as important for human
health and disease. In the immune system, developmentally pro-
grammed somatic mutations produce cellular diversity for anti-
gen recognition. In other lineages, somatic mutations have
been shown to cause human developmental and neurologic dis-
orders and may contribute to autism and schizophrenia (Poduri
et al., 2013). The accumulation of mutations in different tissues
is thought to contribute to the cellular dysfunction that accom-
panies aging (Kennedy et al., 2012; Vijg, 2014). Somatic mutation
also threatens the safety and utility of reprogrammed cells
derived from tissues of adults or aged individuals (Lee et al.,
2013). Yet current knowledge of somatic mutation is quite
limited, and the comprehensive, genome-wide landscape of all
classes of mutation has been not been delineated for any so-
matic cell type.
Among cell types, neurons are of particular interest for
genome sequencing. Most neurons are specified during embry-
onic development, when they exit the cell cycle irreversibly. After
this terminal differentiation, neurons maintain their identity
without cell division or replacement for the remaining lifetime of
the organism. Therefore, many or most somatic mutations in
neurons may arise postmitotically, offering a window into this
poorly understood potential source of mutation. During their life-
time, neurons also face unique genomic threats due to their high
metabolic rate and their use of epigenetic chromatin remodeling
and DNA breaks to alter gene expression in response to neuronal
activity (King et al., 2013; Lister et al., 2013; Madabhushi et al.,
2015; Suberbielle et al., 2013). Finally, neurons exhibit remark-
able cell-type diversity, and their survival is impacted by genes
involved in immune system diversification, leading to sugges-
tions that they may parallel the immune system by employing
programmed DNA rearrangements to generate molecular diver-
sity (Chun and Schatz, 1999; Chun et al., 1991; Frank et al., 1998;
Gao et al., 1998). These unique features of neurons have raised
long-standing questions about the extent to which neurons

1223
 maintain their genomic integrity and predict that neurons may
exhibit unique patterns of mutation relative to other lineages.
Indeed, a series of lower-resolution genomic studies indicates
that neurons may exhibit unusual levels of aneuploidy or DNA
content and harbor frequent, large-scale DNA copy number var-
iants (CNVs) (Cai et al., 2014; Gole et al., 2013; Kingsbury et al.,
2005; Lodato et al., 2015; McConnell et al., 2013; Rehen et al.,
2001, 2005; Westra et al., 2008, 2010). In addition, somatic mo-
bile element insertions (MEIs) have been identified in mouse
(Muotri et al., 2005, 2009), human (Baillie et al., 2011; Coufal
et al., 2009; Evrony et al., 2012; Upton et al., 2015), and fly neu-
rons (Li et al., 2013; Perrat et al., 2013), although these studies
report widely varying estimates, ranging from 0.07 to 129 per
neuron (Coufal et al., 2009; Evrony et al., 2012, 2015; Perrat
et al., 2013; Upton et al., 2015). Understanding whether this vari-
ation is due to neuronal subtype diversity or reflects methodo-
logical differences is key to discerning the functional impact of
MEIs, which have been postulated to contribute to neural diver-
sity (Muotri et al., 2005; Singer et al., 2010; Upton et al., 2015)
and/or neurological disorders (Bundo et al., 2014; Coufal et al.,
2011; Douville et al., 2011; Jeong et al., 2010; Kaneko et al.,
2011; Lathe and Harris, 2009; Li et al., 2012; Muotri et al.,
2010; Tan et al., 2012). Together these intriguing first overviews
of neuronal genome diversity highlight the importance of
applying increasingly sensitive methods to decipher the genome
sequences of neurons and survey the complete landscape of
neuronal somatic mutations.
One major barrier to such studies is the difficulty in establish-
ing methods to faithfully amplify the genomes of single somatic
cells, particularly those that are postmitotic. In vitro single-cell
whole-genome amplification methods produce stochastic arti-
facts that are nearly impossible to distinguish from bona fide so-
matic mutations without access to the original unamplified
genomic material. As such, single-cell genomic analyses can
only reliably detect large genomic changes such as aneuploidy
and copy number variation or recurrent somatic mutations that
can be distinguished from artifacts by their presence in more
than one cell (McConnell et al., 2013). However, as one recent
study reported, recurrent SNVs in neurons are rare (1–11 de-
tected per neuron) compared to a higher number of potentially
unique SNVs (�1,500) that are difficult to reliably distinguish
from errors produced by amplification methods (Lodato et al.,
2015). As such, the few reported high-resolution genomic
studies of individual non-neuronal cells have relied on clonal
expansion and subsequent genome sequencing. Yet because
neurons are postmitotic and can only be induced to divide by
overexpressing multiple mutagenic oncogenes, such appro-
aches are not feasible with this cell type (Ajioka et al., 2007; Beh-
jati et al., 2014; Friedmann-Morvinski et al., 2012; Kim et al.,
2011; Young et al., 2012).
Here, we establish a reprogramming-based method to pro-
duce high-resolution sequences of neuronal genomes and
describe and validate the full mutational spectra of six individual
postmitotic neurons. To accomplish this, we reprogrammed
adult postmitotic neurons using somatic cell nuclear transfer
(SCNT) of neuronal nuclei into enucleated oocytes. In SCNT,
the cytoplasm of the egg faithfully copies the neuronal genome
to produce sufficient DNA for WGS without in vitro amplification
or addition of oncogenes. After SCNT-based genome amplifica-
tion, we applied comprehensive bioinformatic detection algo-
rithms to identify all classes of somatic mutation with base-pair
resolution, thereby producing the first comprehensive picture
of the types, frequency, and patterns of somatic mutation in
neuronal genomes. Finally, we generated cloned mice from
several neuron-derived embryonic stem cell (ESC) lines, showing
that despite their somatic mutations, genomes of adult neurons
can maintain sufficient integrity and plasticity to produce fertile
adult mice.
RESULTS
Reprogramming Adult Postmitotic Neurons by SCNT
We wished to examine the genomes of neurons that have an
early, well-defined birth date and are active and functional
throughout the lifetime of an organism. Therefore, we reprog-
rammed the mitral and tufted neuronal subtype of the olfactory
bulb (MT neurons), which are among the earliest-born neurons
in the brain. The majority of MT neurons exit the cell cycle be-
tween embryonic days 9 and 13 (Imamura et al., 2011) and are
not produced postnatally (Blanchart et al., 2006; Hinds, 1968a,
1968b). MT neurons are active and functional at birth and exhibit
spontaneous and evoked electrical activity throughout the life-
time of an animal (Mair and Gesteland, 1982). In addition, recent
single-neuron tracing studies predict that MT neurons employ
stochastic mechanisms to produce their complex patterns of
axonal branching and synaptic connectivity (Ghosh et al.,
2011; Miyamichi et al., 2011; Sosulski et al., 2011). These fea-
tures suggest that the genomes of MT neurons may be expected
to harbor genomic signatures of postmitotic mutation and/or
extensive cellular diversification.
Because SCNT is inherently inefficient (Ogura et al., 2013), we
employed a genetic marking strategy to conclusively establish
the identity of the donor MT nucleus. We crossed a knockin
Pcdh21/Cre mouse, in which Cre recombinase is coexpressed
with the Pcdh21 protein (Boland et al., 2009; Ghosh et al.,
2011), with the Ai9 tdTomato-based Cre-reporter mouse (Madi-
sen et al., 2010). In Pcdh21/Cre-Ai9 mice, tdTomato expression
is under the control of the Pcdh21 promoter that is active only in
MT cells in the olfactory bulb (Figure 1A). As expected, red fluo-
rescence in the olfactory bulbs of these mice is indeed restricted
to the MT neuron layers and overlaps with Tbr2, a marker of most
MT neurons, but not with markers for astrocytes (S100b), oligo-
dendrocytes (Olig2), microglia (Iba1), or dividing cells (Ki67) (Fig-
ures 1B–1H; Supplemental Experimental Procedures, available
online). Rare tdTomato-positive cells were also detected in the
granule cell layer of the olfactory bulb (<0.1% of all tdTomato-
positive cells). However, due to their scarcity, this population is
unlikely to be the source of the SCNT-ESC lines.
To reprogram MT neurons, we performed SCNT on neurons
isolated from the olfactory bulbs of Pcdh21/Cre-Ai9 mice
(Figure 2A; Supplemental Experimental Procedures). Previous
studies and our pilot experiments indicated that cloning from
post-natal or adult CNS neurons is either very inefficient or
impossible (Makino et al., 2005; Osada et al., 2002; Wakayama
et al., 1998). Therefore, we included the histone deacetylase in-
hibitor Trichostatin A, which has been reported to improve
1224

 cloning efficiency for other cell types (Kishigami et al., 2006). Us-
ing this method, we produced seven SCNT-ESC lines from four
different mice (age range was as follows: 3 weeks to 6 months,
1.1% efficiency; Figures 2B and 2C; Table 1; Supplemental
Experimental Procedures). These MCNT-ESC lines each carry
the genome of an individual MT neuron and can be expanded
indefinitely while maintaining the morphology and gene expres-
sion patterns that characterize ESCs (Figures S1A and S1B).

 lines and matched control tissue (thymus or spleen) derived from
the same donor animal (Figure 2D; Table S1). We used Novoalign
(http://www.novocraft.com) and YAHA (Faust and Hall, 2012) to
align reads and developed a custom suite of variant detection
pipelines that allowed us to detect single nucleotide variants
(SNVs), indels, structural variants (SVs), copy number variants
(CNVs), and MEIs (Figures S2A–S2C; Table S2; Supplemental
Experimental Procedures). Germline variants were excluded by
comparing MCNT-ESC lines to the matched donor tissues
(thymus or spleen) and to a database of mouse strain polymor-
phisms (Keane et al., 2011). We estimated the sensitivity of
each variant detection algorithm by computing the false negative
rate at known polymorphisms from the Mouse Genomes Project
(Table S3; Supplemental Experimental Procedures) (Keane et al.,
2011; Yalcin et al., 2012). To establish false discovery rates we
directly validated subsets of calls using PCR and capillary
sequencing (Table S4; Supplemental Experimental Procedures).
Our variant calling will detect developmentally acquired
neuronal somatic mutations and also identify some mutations
that arose during reprogramming or expansion of MCNT-ESCs
(culture-associated mutations). However, true somatic muta-
tions must have been present on one of the two original chromo-
somes, and therefore these should be heterozygous in all cells in
an ESC line (Figure S2D). In contrast, culture-associated muta-
tions arising after the first cell division, or even during the short
time window of reprogramming prior to division (�24 hr), will
be present in only a subset of cells per line (Figures S2F and
S2G). The only exception to this would be mutations acquired
on both strands of the neuronal genome prior to the first S-phase
following nuclear transfer (Figure S2E); however, these are ex-
pected to be exceedingly rare (Li et al., 2014; Ma et al., 2014).
A true somatic mutation must be heterozygous yet uniform in a
MCNT-ESC line. Therefore, somatic mutations will exhibit an
average variant allele frequency (VAF) of �50%, while mosaic
culture-associated mutations will have lower apparent VAFs
(Figures S2D–S2G). Accordingly, for SNVs and indels, we used
alignment-based VAF estimates and a VAF cutoff of >30% to
distinguish high-confidence somatic mutations from likely cul-
ture-associated mutations (Figure S2C). For SVs and MEIs,
VAFs are difficult to approximate from sequencing data. We

 therefore derived subclones of each MCNT-ESC line at early
passages and performed PCR to identify SVs and MEIs that
were present in all subclones, while eliminating mosaic variants
(Figure 2E).
Genomic Variation among MT Neurons Impacts Genes
These analyses revealed that each MT neuron has a unique
genome harboring �100 somatic mutations. The six MT neurons
we analyzed contained �87 (68–139) validated somatic muta-
tions comprising 69 (50–112) SNVs, 17 (9–24) indels, 1.5 (0–3)
SVs, and 0.7 (0–2) MEIs (Tables 2, S5, S6, S7, and S8). Applying
our false discovery rates, we estimate that MT neurons have a
true mutational burden of 112 (89–181) mutations per genome.
The notable variation in mutational load per neuron is not depen-
dent on sequence coverage (Figures 2F and 2G). For example,
two neurons from 3-week-old mice differed by a factor of �2
(89 versus 181), despite having nearly identical sequencing depth
and variant detection sensitivity (Tables 2 and S1). These data are
consistent with the extreme variability in mutational burden pre-
viously observed for large-scale CNVs (>5 mb) using single-
neuron genome sequencing (Cai et al., 2014; McConnell et al.,
2013). However, we did not observe any highly aberrant neuronal
genomes marked by multiple large CNVs, and we detected no
aneuploidy. One explanation for this may be our sample size.
Alternatively, the use of SCNT to reprogram neurons may be
less efficient for highly mutated genomes. However, it is impor-
tant to note that the efficiency of generating MCNT-ESC lines
(Table 1) is similar to those reported for other differentiated cell
types, suggesting that the majority of MT neurons are not highly
mutated in ways that preclude reprogramming (Hochedlinger
and Jaenisch, 2002; Osada et al., 2005; Wakayama et al., 2005).
Given that these neuronal genomes harbor �100 or more new
somatic mutations, we asked whether any of these mutations
were likely to impact gene function (Supplemental Experimental
Procedures). Remarkably, ten of the somatic mutations we iden-
tified alter the coding sequence of known genes, at least four of
which are expressed in MT neurons (Figure S3). These include
missense mutations in Cdc40, Tas2r113, Klf16, Dhx37, and
Tekt5, a single codon deletion in Gpr44, an exon deletion in
Pkd2l2, an exon duplication in Atp10b, a deletion encompassing
the Zic1 and Zic4 genes, and disruption of the Aven gene. In to-
tal, five of the six neuronal genomes that we analyzed in depth
carry mutated coding sequences, demonstrating that individual
neuronal genomes often carry one or more newly mutated
genes. However, this did not represent a statistically significant
enrichment, perhaps due to our small sample size. In addition,
because mutations also fall in intronic and brain-related regula-
tory regions (Figure S3), these numbers likely underestimate
the potential functional consequence of somatic mutation in
MT neurons (Wan et al., 2014).
Lack of Recurrent Mutations in MT Neurons
If the majority of somatic mutations in neurons arise early in
development, MT neurons derived from the same donor might
contain recurrent mutations (Evrony et al., 2015). Here, we
analyzed three MCNT-ESC lines from one donor mouse (mouse
B) and two from another (mouse C), although one MCNT-ESC
line from the latter dataset was excluded from other analyses
due to culture-derived loss of one X chromosome that led to a
population bottleneck that would generate false positive candi-
date somatic mutations. None of the mutations we detected
were shared. This could indicate that the mutations arose late
in development or after neuronal differentiation and mitotic
exit. However, these results are also consistent with a diverse
embryonic origin for MT neuron precursors, as has been re-
ported for human cortical neurons (Lodato et al., 2015).
If neurons employ diversity-generating DNA rearrangements
such as those seen in the immune system, we would expect to
find identical or highly similar mutations in particular loci in neu-
rons from different animals. However, none of our high-confi-
dence somatic mutations exhibited these features, and PCR
tests excluded all of the low-confidence candidate recurrent
SV calls (n = 16) (Supplemental Experimental Procedures).
Further, the SVs we detected in individual MCNT-ESC lines did
not exhibit hallmarks of programmed rearrangement, such as
joining of alternative exons or somatic hypermutation. We also
visually inspected the protocadherin gene clusters, which have
been proposed as candidate loci for programmed rearrange-
ments in neuronal genomes (Yagi, 2003), and found no evidence
of rearrangements. These results strongly argue that DNA rear-
rangements at a defined locus are not required for neuronal
maturation or function. However, we cannot rule out the possibil-
ity that rare MT neurons or neurons from other subtypes employ
diversity-generating mutations.
SVs and MEIs Are Rare in MT Neurons
SVs are of special interest due to their potential to cause large
phenotypic effects and because several lines of evidence sug-
gest that neurons may be especially prone to double-strand
breaks (Frank et al., 1998; Gao et al., 1998; Madabhushi et al.,
2015; Suberbielle et al., 2013). The six MT neurons harbored
nine total SVs, with a range of 0–3 per cell (Figure 2G). Each
SV breakpoint had very limited microhomology (0–4 bp), and
several contained a small number of inserted bases of unknown
origin (2–7 bp) (Table S7), which is characteristic of repair by non-
homologous end joining (NHEJ), the only type of double-strand
break repair employed by postmitotic cells. Notably, three of
the nine SVs were complex rearrangements (Figures 3A–3C).
The most complex variant involved multiple small deletions, a
7.5 kb nonduplicative transposition, and a 1.4 mb inversion (dis-
rupting the Aven gene), with none of the breakpoints showing

 more than 1 bp of microhomology. This variant is best explained
by a mechanism similar to chromothripsis involving regional DNA
shattering and error-prone NHEJ. Chromothripsis is known to
contribute to cancer and rare human disorders (Quinlan and
Hall, 2012) but has an unknown role in healthy cell biology (Hatch
and Hetzer, 2015). Although we cannot rule out the possibility
that any given mutation occurred during reprogramming, our
findings suggest that chromothripsis may occur in healthy
postmitotic cells and that complex rearrangements may play
an unanticipated role in neuronal genome diversity.
The extent to which somatically acquired MEIs contribute to
neuronal genome diversity is a major unresolved question. Our
application of WGS and methods that definitively distinguish
true mutations from amplification artifacts and other false posi-
tive calls provides a unique opportunity to measure the MEI land-
scape in single neurons with high sensitivity and accuracy. In to-
tal, we predicted five MEIs, four of which were validated by PCR.
Individual MT neurons carried 0–2 MEIs (Figure 2G). Our most
conservative estimate for MEI detection sensitivity is 52% (Table
S3), which predicts an average of, at most, 1.3 new MEIs per MT
neuron genome. Thus, these studies are most consistent with re-
sults of two recent single-cell sequencing experiments (Evrony
et al., 2012, 2015) and suggest that most MT neurons have a
very low MEI burden. However, it is important to note that
different neuronal subtypes may exhibit varying degrees of MEI
activity, which could have interesting implications for neuronal
diversity.
SNVs in MT Neurons Exhibit Unique Features, Impact
Genes, and May Arise Postmitotically
The most common classes of mutations are indels and SNVs.
We found that individual MT neurons harbored between 12 and
34 indels and between 62 and 142 SNVs. To determine whether
this represented an unusually high or low mutational burden, we
compared MT neurons with data reported for other dividing and
nondividing cell types (Figure 3D; Supplemental Experimental
Procedures). MT neurons carry more SNVs per megabase than
reported for human oocytes, which are similar to MT neurons
in that they also exit the cell cycle early in development (Kong
et al., 2012). However, this is not statistically significant when
corrected for multiple comparisons. The average number of
SNVs in MT neurons is significantly lower than reported for
mouse fibroblasts and intestinal cells and similar to prostate,
stomach, and sperm cells, all of which are expected to have
undergone more cell divisions than MT neurons (Behjati et al.,
2014; Kong et al., 2012; Young et al., 2012).
Closer examination of SNVs revealed several intriguing fea-
tures that may represent unique signatures of neuron-specific
and/or postmitotic mutation. One unique feature emerged from
analyses of potential mutational clusters, which identified three
clusters of 2–3 SNVs. Two were multiple nucleotide polymor-
phisms affecting adjacent nucleotides, while the third impacted
three nucleotides spanning 249 bp in the Atxn7l1 gene. Given
the size of our dataset, these clustered mutations are highly un-
likely to have arisen independently and may result from a muta-
tional event similar to kataegis (Nik-Zainal et al., 2012).
MT neurons also exhibit a significant enrichment of C/T con-
versions within the context of TpCpN trinucleotides: 44% of
neuronal SNVs occurred within the TpCpN context, versus
�25% for germline SNPs (p < 0.0001, Fisher’s exact test) (Fig-
ure 3E). To our knowledge, the only mutational process that fa-
vors this sequence context is cytosine deamination by Apobec1
(Beale et al., 2004), which has been previously implicated in ac-
tivity-induced epigenetic modifications in neuronal genomes

Summarizes mutations predicted by variant detection pipelines (mutation calls), results of subsequent validation experiments, and estimates of the
true number of mutations. Mutation calls and false discovery rate (FDR) are omitted for SV and MEIs because all calls were tested by PCR. For
SNVs and indels, the FDR was estimated by PCR validation of a subset of calls. 69 of 69 SNVs and 22 of 23 indels validated. Estimated mutation counts
take into account the FDR for SNVs and indels and the false negative rate (FNR) for all mutations. See also Tables S3, S4, S5, S6, S7, and S8.

 (Guo et al., 2011). In contrast, the overall MT neuron SNV base
conversion spectrum is not obviously distinct from the overall
spectrum reported for human germline and does not contain ev-
idence of elevated action of specific mutagens, as has been re-
ported for small intestine cells and some cancers (Figure S4;
Supplemental Experimental Procedures) (Behjati et al., 2014;
Kong et al., 2012; Pleasance et al., 2010a, 2010b). In particular,
we did not detect known signatures of oxidative damage,
such as increased G/T conversions, which one might expect
in highly metabolically active cells.

Genomes
(A–C) Complex genomic rearrangements (CGRs)
observed in MT neurons. Bottom bar represents
wild-type; top bar represents mutated configu-
ration.
(A) In a chromothripsis-like CGR on chromosome 2
in line B2, fragment C is transposed downstream;
fragment F is deleted, removing an exon from
Aven; and fragment G is inverted, impacting many
Aven exons. Small deletions are present at each
breakpoint (arrows), and a 7 bp insertion is present
at the junction between E and G.
(B) A CGR on chromosome 18 in line C5 involves
two deletions within 3 kb. One deletes exon 4 of
the Pkd2l2 gene.
(C) A 21 kb deletion on chromosome 12 in line B2 is
comprised of fragment B, a 17 bp inversion, and a
5 bp insertion of unknown origin.
(D) Total number of SNVs normalized by the length
of the mouse or human diploid or haploid genome.
Mean and SEM are plotted.
(E) Percent of C/T conversions within each 3 bp
context for MT neuron SNVs and germline SNPs.
MT neuron SNVs occur significantly more often
in the TpCpN context (�44% versus �25%, p <
0.0001, Fisher’s exact test).
(F) The number of MT neuron SNVs appearing in
evolutionarily conserved regions of the genome
is significantly higher than expected by chance
(27 actual versus �17 simulated, SD shown on
graph = �4, p = 0.010, Monte Carlo).
(G) Percent of total MT neuron and endodermal
SNVs that fall in genes. SNVs in MT neurons are
enriched in genes relative to endodermal SNVs
(p = 0.004, Fisher’s exact test). The dashed line
indicates the percentage of the genome that falls
into genes.
(H) SNVs found in MT neurons are not depleted in
highly expressed genes (top 50%) and are en-
riched in these genes compared to SNVs found in
endodermal cell types (p = 0.025, Fisher’s exact
test).
(I) In contrast, small intestine SNVs are depleted in
their own highly expressed genes relative to
chance (p = 2.2 3 10�16, Poisson test). Small in-
testine SNVs are also depleted in highly expressed
genes relative to MT neuron SNVs (p = 7.06 3

 To determine whether SNVs in MT neurons are enriched in
particular genomic regions, we compared the distribution of
the 395 high-confidence autosomal somatic SNVs to various
genome annotations (Supplemental Experimental Procedures).
Intriguingly, while somatic mutations are distributed randomly
with respect to most genomic features (Table S9), they show a
significant enrichment in evolutionarily conserved elements,
which demarcate functionally relevant features such as genes
and regulatory regions (1.6-fold, p = 0.01 by Monte Carlo simu-
lation; Figure 3F).
This result led us to directly investigate whether somatic muta-
tions in MT neurons were preferentially found in genes, compared
to simulations that account for gene length and compared to the
spectra of somatic mutations found in other cell types (Supple-
mental Experimental Procedures). The percentage of SNVs
found in genes is equivalent to the genic fraction of the genome
(Figure 3G). In contrast, neuronal SNVs are 1.2-fold more preva-
lent in genic regions than SNVs found in endodermal cell types,
which are the only other mouse somatic cells sequenced at
base-pair resolution at the time of our analyses (p = 0.004,
Fisher’s exact test; Figure 3G) (Behjati et al., 2014).
In cancer cells, as well as human white blood cells, SNVs are
depleted in expressed genes (Alexandrov et al., 2013; Holstege
et al., 2014; Lawrence et al., 2013). To assess whether this was
also true of MT neurons, we generated a list of genes that are
transcribed in MT neurons using RNA-seq on flow-sorted MT
neurons from the Pcdh21/Cre-Ai9 mouse strain (Supplemental
Experimental Procedures). MT neuron SNVs are enriched in
highly expressed genes (top 50%) compared with SNVs found
in endodermal cells (Behjati et al., 2014) (p = 0.025 by Fisher’s
exact test; Figure 3H), and they are not depleted relative to the
overall genic content of the genome. For comparison, we per-
formed similar analyses of small intestine SNVs using a recently
published RNA-seq dataset for Lrg5-expressing small intestine
stem cells (Sheaffer et al., 2014), which are the same stem
cells used to generate the small-intestine-derived organoids
sequenced by Behjati et al. (2014). As predicted by studies of
other lineages, mutations from the small intestine are depleted
in genes that are highly expressed in small intestine stem cells
(p = 2.2 3 10�16 by Poisson test) and also relative to MT neuron
SNVs (p = 7.06 3 10�4 by Fisher’s exact test; Figure 3I) (Behjati
et al., 2014). Therefore, MT neurons exhibit a relative bias toward
genes and expressed genes that has not been reported for other
lineages and is independent of the length of expressed genes.
Overall, SNVs in MT neurons exhibit several unique features.
SNVs are found in contexts consistent with Apobec1 action on
cytosine bases. In addition, SNVs in MT neurons are biased to-
ward evolutionarily conserved regions and appear to preferen-
tially accumulate in functionally relevant genomic regions. Paired
with the prevalence and unique features observed in MT neuron
SVs, these studies predict that somatic mutation in MT neurons,
as well as other neuronal subtypes, may have functional rele-
vance, particularly if they continue to accumulate throughout
the lifetime of the animal.
Developmental Potency of MT Neuron Genomes
The developmental potency of neurons and of mutated somatic
cell types remains poorly understood but has relevance for our
understanding of neurobiology and for the use of reprogrammed
adult cells in regenerative medicine. Having demonstrated that
MT neuron genomes harbor many mutations, some of which
are large, complex, and impact genes, we next sought to deter-
mine whether these genomes maintain sufficient integrity and
plasticity to produce fertile adult animals. We therefore tested
the developmental potency of six MCNT-ESC lines using tetra-
ploid embryo complementation (TEC), an assay in which only
fully pluripotent cells can produce a viable mouse (Nagy et al.,
1990, 1993). Indeed, three MCNT-ESC lines maintained full plu-
ripotency based on the production of fertile adult mice, while
another line produced full-term pups that died shortly after birth
(Figures 4A–4D; Table 3). The remaining two lines produced em-
bryos that died in early or midgestation, which is consistent with
studies of induced pluripotent stem cells and other SCNT-ESCs.
The MCNT mice were derived entirely from MT neurons, based
on their ubiquitous expression of tdTomato and lack of detect-
able microsatellite DNA from the tetraploid host cells (Figures
4E and 4F; Figures S5A–S5E; Supplemental Experimental Pro-
cedures) (Boland et al., 2009). Because all tissues in mice gener-
ated using TEC are derived entirely from the donor ESC line,
these mice will harbor all of the mutations found in the original
neuron in each of their cells. To confirm this, we performed
PCR on mouse tissues from line B2 and demonstrated the pres-
ence of two expected SVs (Figure S5F). Mice cloned from these
MT neurons were healthy and fertile, with morphologically
normal brains and olfactory bulbs (Figure 4E), suggesting that
the genomic changes in MT neurons do not necessarily impact
their differentiation into or away from their original lineage
(Hochedlinger and Jaenisch, 2002). These functional studies
are the first demonstration that neuronal nuclei from animals
beyond 8 weeks of age can maintain pluripotency, showing
that the epigenetic changes that accompany cell-cycle exit, ter-
minal differentiation, synaptic refinement, and persistent activity
for up to 4.5 months can be reversed by factors in the oocyte
cytoplasm.
DISCUSSION
Here, we have established the first high-quality base-pair
resolution sequence of neuronal genomes. We find that each
MT neuron has a unique genome harboring �100 somatic muta-
tions of diverse classes, which predicts that an individual brain
contains billions of unique genomes. Notably, we did not detect
recurrent DNA rearrangements or MEI insertion patterns consis-
tent with the longstanding hypothesis that programmed somatic
mutations may be used to generate functional neuronal diversity.
However, the majority of neurons carried at least one gene-dis-
rupting mutation. These studies also provide evidence that the
genomic context and distribution of SNVs in mouse neurons dif-
fers from other lineages, providing evidence for variable somatic
mutation mechanisms among different cell lineages.
Importantly, these mouse studies establish that several unique
features of human neuronal genomes unveiled by single-cell
sequencing studies can be confirmed by orthogonal methods
in mice and therefore are likely to have originated prior to human
evolution. Our studies agree with reports that human neurons
harbor few MEIs (Evrony et al., 2012). In addition, we find that
1230
Neuron 89, 1223–1236, March 16, 2016 ª2016 Elsevier Inc.
 SNVs in mouse neurons exhibit enrichment in evolutionarily
conserved regions, as recently reported (Lodato et al., 2015).
However, our findings differ from other results based on single-
cell sequencing of human neurons. First, mouse MT neurons har-
bor fewer total SNVs than reported for human cortical neurons
(�100 versus �1,500) (Lodato et al., 2015). Second, we find
that the proportion of C to T SNVs in MT neurons is broadly
similar to that in other cell types (�35%–45% of total; Figure S4),
while the human study reports a dramatic increase in C to T mu-
tations (�75%–85%) (Lodato et al., 2015). These discrepancies
could arise from differences in the fidelity of in vitro and in vivo
genome amplification. For example, the known error rate of
F29 polymerase predicts that one amplification cycle would
result in �500–5,000 apparent mutations based on replication
errors (Dean et al., 2002), while cell division is reported to pro-
duce only �1 mutation (Behjati et al., 2014; Kong et al., 2012).

Similarly, F29-based analyses of individ-
ual sperm cells report highly elevated fre-
quencies of C to T transitions (Wang et al.,
2012), which contrasts with pedigree-
based analyses of germline mutation
and the results of our study (Kong et al.,
2012). Alternatively, it is possible that
the

human

and

studies reflect inherent differences be-
tween species or neuronal subtypes.
Nevertheless, SNVs found in mouse
and human neurons exhibit unique signa-
tures compared to other cell types. Why
might neuronal mutations differ from
those in endodermal lineages, cancer
cells, and blood cells, and perhaps from
those from other cell types? Mutations
are generally assumed to arise during
cell division. However, MT neurons exit
the cell cycle at early embryonic stages (embryonic days 9–13)
after �14 cell divisions. This would predict a mutation rate of
�4–10 SNVs per division (Supplemental Experimental Proce-
dures), which is higher than estimated for the human male germ-
line or other somatic lineages (0.12 and 1.1 SNVs per cell divi-
sion, respectively), leading us to consider alternative sources
of mutation in MT neurons (Behjati et al., 2014; Kong et al.,
2012). One appealing alternative is postmitotic mutation. While
postmitotic mutation has not been formally described for any
cell type, several features of MT neuron mutations are consistent
with this mechanism. First, genes that are dynamically regulated
by activity in postmitotic neurons are thought to undergo cyto-
sine demethylation, which could explain the Apobec1 signature
we observe. Second, we identify an apparent bias toward genes
expressed in MT neurons, which is difficult to explain if these mu-
tations arose in precursor cells. However, MT neuron mutations
Neuron 89, 1223–1236, March 16, 2016 ª2016 Elsevier Inc.
1231
 are also enriched in genes in general, and we cannot determine
whether expressed genes are significantly more vulnerable to
mutation with our current sample size. Finally, SVs in MT neurons
exhibit signs of NHEJ rather than replication-based mecha-
nisms, consistent with a postmitotic origin.
If the majority of SNVs in MT neurons arise postmitotically, it is
possible that mutations continue to accumulate throughout the
lifetime of an individual. For example, if the �100 mutations
that we observe in a 4.5-month-old mouse were to accumulate
at that approximate rate (e.g., �200/year) in humans, neurons
from a 50-year-old individual might harbor 10,000 somatic
SNVs, which is on par with the SNV burden in cancer genomes.
However, although our study examined neurons derived from
3-week-old and 4.5-month-old mice, we did not observe a signif-
icant increase of SNVs with mouse age, which is also consistent
with another study (Lodato et al., 2015).
It is important to note that our study is specifically designed
to provide a ‘‘best-case scenario’’ of genomic mosaicism in
neurons and may underestimate the true mutational burden.
SCNT-based cloning may select against the most highly
mutated neurons, such as the subset of genomically ‘‘aberrant’’
neurons harboring many CNVs reported previously (McConnell
et al., 2013) or neurons harboring deleterious aneuploidies or
MEI insertions.
Finally, the design of this study also allows us to functionally
test the consequence of neuronal differentiation and maturation
on the epigenetic plasticity of neuronal genomes. By generating
neonatal and fertile adult mice from genetically labeled MT neu-
rons derived from mice up to 4.5 months old, we demonstrate
that despite the difficulty in inducing neurons to re-enter the
cell cycle, at least some neurons maintain sufficiently plastic
and intact genomes to produce an entire animal. While other
studies have reported varying degrees of success (or failure) in
efforts to clone from nonembryonic cortical neurons, this study
is unique because we conclusively demonstrate the donor cell
origin and age and produce the first clones from adult mice older
than 6–8 weeks of age (Kawase et al., 2000; Makino et al., 2005;
Mizutani et al., 2015; Osada et al., 2002, 2005; Wakayama et al.,
1998; Yamazaki et al., 2001). In addition, because we have deci-
phered full MT neuronal genome sequences, we show that accu-
mulation of mutations during the development and postmitotic
aging of neurons is compatible with seemingly normal embryonic
and post-natal development, which has relevance for the use of
adult cells in regenerative medicine.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
TSRI Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved all animal
procedures.
Somatic Cell Nuclear Transfer and Derivation of MCNT-ESC Lines
MT neurons were dissociated and purified as described previously (Brewer
and Torricelli, 2007), with modifications (Supplemental Experimental Proce-
dures). Oocytes were harvested from superovulated females, and metaphase
II spindles were removed and replaced with neuronal nuclei. Embryos were
treated with 5 nM Trichostatin A, artificially activated with strontium chloride,
and cultured to blastocyst stage. Zonae pellucida were removed, embryos
were cultured on a mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) feeder layer, and inner
cell mass outgrowths were picked and dissociated with trypsin. Resulting
ESC lines were expanded on an MEF feeder layer. See Supplemental Experi-
mental Procedures for further details.
WGS
Early passage MCNT-ESCs were separated from feeders by serial preplating.
DNA was isolated from MCNT-ESCs and thymus or spleen using standard
phenol chloroform extraction, ethanol precipitation, and RNaseA digestion.
Samples were sequenced by Beijing Genomics Institute using standard library
prep for an Illumina Hi-Seq 2000. Reads were aligned with Novoalign against
the full mm9 reference. Additional methods are in Supplemental Experimental
Procedures.
Identifying Somatic Mutations
We used the GATK best practices pipeline (DePristo et al., 2011) to call SNPs
and indels relative to the reference genome. Putative de novo somatic
SNV and indel mutations were identified via a strategy similar to Kong et al.
(2012) (Supplemental Experimental Procedures).
To identify SVs, all unmapped and clipped reads were extracted from the
initial alignments and realigned with YAHA (Faust and Hall, 2012) to find
possible split-read mappings spanning SV breakpoints. Discordant read pairs
were used in conjunction with these split reads as input to LUMPY (Layer et al.,
2014) to make SV calls. To identify somatic SVs, we selected calls with evi-
dence in exactly one MCNT-ESC line, except when searching for shared SVs.
MEIs were identified using a modified version of Lee et al. (2012) as
diagrammed in Figures S2A and S2B. Discordant read pairs and unmapped
and clipped reads were extracted from the initial alignments and realigned
against a synthetic reference library formed from known LINE, SINE, and
LTR sequences (Table S2). Mates of reads that aligned well to the mobile
element (ME) library were clustered by their ME type/subtype and their refer-
ence coordinates. If two clusters were found with nearly abutting reference
genome coordinates and the proper strand orientation, an MEI was called.

Perinatal pups and juvenile and adult animals are defined as those which survived to post-natal day 4, weaning, and 2 months, respectively. The single
surviving pup generated from MCNT-ESC line D4 was moribund and euthanized at post-natal day 4. This pup was later determined to have high
contribution of tetraploid blastocyst host DNA (Figure S5D) and was likely a diploid chimera, which can result from rare failed fusion events during
tetraploid blastocyst generation.

 Evidence for the remaining calls was bolstered by split-read mappings in
which one portion of a read was aligned to the ME library and the other to
the reference genome within a cluster region. Candidate somatic MEIs were
those found to be present in a single MCNT-ESC line, except when searching
for shared MEIs.
Somatic Variant Validation
To validate candidate de novo mutations, we performed PCR amplification of
the genomic region containing the putative mutation on DNA from the MCNT-
ESC line and its control thymus or spleen sample. The products were Sanger
sequenced to verify that the mutation was present in the MCNT-ESC line, but
not in the control. For SNVs and indels, we tested a random subset of calls. For
SVs and MEIs, we tested all calls. Additional experimental details and false dis-
covery rates are in Supplemental Experimental Procedures and Table S4.
Monte Carlo Simulation to Determine Enrichment of SNVs in
Genomic Features
Monte Carlo simulations were carried out separately for each of nine genomic
features (Table S9). To simulate our 395 high-confidence autosomal SNVs, we
randomly distributed 395 simulated SNVs 10,000 times throughout the mm9
autosomes, excluding gap regions and regions in which the total read depth
precluded us from making somatic SNV calls. An enrichment p value was
then calculated as the fraction of trials in which the number of randomly distrib-
uted SNVs falling within the genomic feature of interest was less than the num-
ber of the actual somatic SNVs falling within the feature.
RNA-Seq and Analysis
MT neurons were dissociated from Pcdh21/Cre-Ai9 mice as for nuclear trans-
fer and flow sorted to isolate tdTomato-positive neurons. RNA was purified
and amplified prior to Illumina sequencing. See Supplemental Experimental
Procedures for additional details. RNA-seq data for Lgr5-positive small intes-
tine stem cells were downloaded from the NCBI database (SRA: ERX421326,
ERX421327, ERX421329).
We used TopHat (Trapnell et al., 2009) to measure the expression of genes in
each dataset, then combined expression estimates by tissue of origin using
Cufflinks (Trapnell et al., 2010). Genes exhibiting greater-than-median expres-
sion levels were termed ‘‘highly expressed.’’
