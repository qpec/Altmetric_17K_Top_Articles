Abstract
Background
School food environment policies may be a critical tool to promote healthy diets in children,
yet their effectiveness remains unclear.
Objective
To systematically review and quantify the impact of school food environment policies on die-
tary habits, adiposity, and metabolic risk in children.
Methods
We systematically searched online databases for randomized or quasi-experimental inter-
ventions assessing effects of school food environment policies on children’s dietary habits,
adiposity, or metabolic risk factors. Data were extracted independently and in duplicate, and
pooled using inverse-variance random-effects meta-analysis. Habitual (within+outside
school) dietary intakes were the primary outcome. Heterogeneity was explored using meta-
regression and subgroup analysis. Funnel plots, Begg’s and Egger’s test evaluated potential
publication bias.
Results
From 6,636 abstracts, 91 interventions (55 in US/Canada, 36 in Europe/New Zealand) were
included, on direct provision of healthful foods/beverages (N = 39 studies), competitive
food/beverage standards (N = 29), and school meal standards (N = 39) (some interventions
assessed multiple policies). Direct provision policies, which largely targeted fruits and vege-
tables, increased consumption of fruits by 0.27 servings/d (n = 15 estimates (95%CI: 0.17,
0.36)) and combined fruits and vegetables by 0.28 servings/d (n = 16 (0.17, 0.40)); with a
slight impact on vegetables (n = 11; 0.04 (0.01, 0.08)), and no effects on total calories (n = 6;

 -56 kcal/d (-174, 62)). In interventions targeting water, habitual intake was unchanged (n =
3; 0.33 glasses/d (-0.27, 0.93)). Competitive food/beverage standards reduced sugar-
sweetened beverage intake by 0.18 servings/d (n = 3 (-0.31, -0.05)); and unhealthy snacks
by 0.17 servings/d (n = 2 (-0.22, -0.13)), without effects on total calories (n = 5; -79 kcal/d
(-179, 21)). School meal standards (mainly lunch) increased fruit intake (n = 2; 0.76 serv-
ings/d (0.37, 1.16)) and reduced total fat (-1.49%energy; n = 6 (-2.42, -0.57)), saturated
fat (n = 4; -0.93%energy (-1.15, -0.70)) and sodium (n = 4; -170 mg/d (-242, -98)); but not
total calories (n = 8; -38 kcal/d (-137, 62)). In 17 studies evaluating adiposity, significant
decreases were generally not identified; few studies assessed metabolic factors (blood lip-
ids/glucose/pressure), with mixed findings. Significant sources of heterogeneity or publica-
tion bias were not identified.
Conclusions
Specific school food environment policies can improve targeted dietary behaviors; effects
on adiposity and metabolic risk require further investigation. These findings inform ongoing
policy discussions and debates on best practices to improve childhood dietary habits and
health.
Introduction
Diets of most children and adolescents (hereafter referred to as children) remain poor, with
tremendous consequences for metabolic diseases, overweight and obesity, and other nutrition-
related illness [1–4]. Childhood is also a critical period to establish lifelong eating habits which
influence future risk of obesity and cardiometabolic diseases [5–7]. Youth consume between
one-third to one-half of meals at school, making this a crucial setting for interventions that
alter the food environment [8]. Considering that almost all children obtain some years of
schooling, and of diverse ethnic and socio-economic groups, health promotion efforts in
schools could have a broader impact on eating behaviors and future disease risk.
Promising school food environment policies include direct provision of healthful foods/
beverages such as fruits and vegetables (F&V), quality standards for competitive foods and
beverages (foods and beverages sold outside of school meal programs), and quality standards
(targets for foods, nutrients/energy) for school meals (lunch, breakfast) [8]. For example, in
2008, a US Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program (FFVP) was expanded nationally for elementary
schools with highest low-income enrolments to provide free F&V to students outside usual
school meals [9]; and in 2007, a similar free school fruit programme was implemented in Nor-
way to provide daily a free piece of fruit or vegetable to all secondary school students [10]. The
Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act in 2010 [11] introduced Smart Snack Standards for competi-
tive foods and beverages in schools receiving federal meal funding, including restriction of
sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) to be fully implemented by 2014–15 [12]. In 2012, US
National School Lunch and School Breakfast Programs nutrition standards were significantly
updated to be more consistent with US Dietary Guidelines [13], and in 2015 the UK Depart-
ment of Education mandated revised standards for all food served in schools [14].
Yet, effectiveness of these food environment policies for improving children’s habitual die-
tary habits, adiposity, or metabolic risk is not well-established. Understanding these effects is
critical to estimate benefits of existing programs as well as need for their expansion; and to

 elucidate potential harms from their elimination as suggested by potential new federal priori-
ties in the US [15,16]. Prior studies have reviewed whether a range of school dietary interven-
tions increase F&V consumption but often without focusing on environmental policies [17–
22]; while other systematic reviews have been qualitative [23], assessed efficacy of competitive
food/beverage standards informed mainly by cross-sectional studies [24], or focused on educa-
tional (rather than environmental) interventions [25]. Other reviews have grouped together
highly varied programs, e.g., teacher training, child education, family components, labeling,
pricing changes, behavioral techniques, and school gardens [26–32]. Thus, effectiveness of
school food environment policies remain unclear, including potential differences for in-school
vs. habitual (within and outside school) intakes. To address these gaps in knowledge, we sys-
tematically investigated and quantified the effects of school food environment interventions
-carefully exploring sources of heterogeneity-, including provision of healthful foods/bever-
ages, competitive food/beverage standards, and school meal standards, on habitual and in-
school dietary consumption, adiposity, and metabolic risk factors in children. This investiga-
tion was performed as part of the Food-PRICE (Policy Review and Intervention Cost-Effec-
tiveness) Project (www.food-price.org).
Methods
PRISMA recommendations were followed throughout all stages of this meta-analysis (Appen-
dix A in S1 File) [33]. The objective, search strategy, and selection criteria were specified in
advance (Appendix B in S1 File).
Primary exposures and outcomes
The primary intervention was school food environment policies targeting food/beverage avail-
ability across the school setting (e.g., classroom, cafeterias, vending machines, tuck shops)
including direct provision (free, reduced-price, or full-price) of healthful foods or beverages
outside of usual school meals (e.g., fresh F&V programs, water fountains, increased availability
of healthy foods at vending machines), nutritional quality standards for competitive foods/
beverages, and nutritional quality standards for school meals (lunch, breakfast). The primary
outcome was the change in habitual consumption of the targeted food, beverage, or nutrient,
evaluated by reported intakes or objective sales/purchases data as a proxy for consumption.
Secondary outcomes included changes in in-school meal nutrient content and intake (to com-
pare and contrast to findings for habitual intake), total caloric intake, adiposity (body mass
index (BMI), prevalence of overweight (�85th-95th percentile), obesity (�95th percentile) or
overweight/obesity combined); and metabolic measures (e.g., blood lipids, blood glucose,
blood pressure).
Search strategy
Multiple online databases were systematically searched including PubMed, EconLit, CINAHL,
CABI, Web of Science, PAIS, Cochrane Library, AGRIS, Open Grey, Faculty of 1000 and
EMBASE earliest available through March 9, 2014 without restrictions on language or country.
Online searches were updated in PubMed from March 10, 2014 to December 14, 2017 as this
is the primary database for research in this field, and the majority (>95%) of relevant papers in
the initial review were identified in PubMed. The intervention periods of identified publica-
tions largely preceded widespread implementation of the new US school lunch standards,
Smart Snacks Standards, FFVP, or revised UK school meal standards. Search terms utilized 4
categories, including on the intervention, dietary target, outcome, and setting (Appendix C in
S1 File); supplemented by hand-searching of citations and the first 20 “related articles” in

 PubMed for each final included article. Titles/abstracts were screened by one investigator; and
for all potentially relevant articles, full-texts were retrieved.
Study selection
Full-text manuscripts were evaluated independently and in duplicate, with differences resolved
by consensus or, if necessary, group discussion. Inclusion criteria were (a) all randomized or
quasi-experimental interventions that (b) assessed the impact of school food environment pol-
icies in preschool, primary, or secondary schools on the outcomes of interest among generally
healthy children age 2–18y; and (c) reported a quantitative change in the outcome (Appendix
B in S1 File). We excluded cross-sectional, retrospective, case-control, modeling, methodology,
and laboratory studies; reviews, commentaries, books, and studies for which full-text articles
could not be retrieved. Studies were excluded if the policy focused on changes outside of food/
beverage availability (e.g., student education, food labeling, price changes), if the food/bever-
age environmental policy was a minor component (qualitatively, <30%, as judged by two
independent reviewers) of a multi-component intervention, if intervention duration was <4
weeks, or if only knowledge or attitudes were evaluated as outcomes.
Data extraction
Data were extracted independently and in duplicate using standardized electronic templates
(Microsoft Access, Office 2010). Extracted information included first author, publication year,
study location, design, population (age, sex, race, sample size), intervention characteristics
(components, targets, duration), outcome data including habitual (within and outside school)
and in-school (e.g., lunch, breakfast, total in-school) intakes (definition, ascertainment meth-
ods, effect size, precision estimate), covariates, and for multi-component interventions, the rel-
ative contribution of the food environment policy component to the overall intervention (low:
30–59%, medium: 60–89%, high: �90%; qualitatively assessed independently and in dupli-
cate). Missing data or definitions were resolved by direct author contact, where possible.
For outcomes evaluated at multiple time-points, we extracted the latest follow-up measure
at end-intervention. Sustainability findings based on follow-up after end-intervention were
also extracted when available and �4 weeks duration. Study quality was assessed indepen-
dently and in duplicate based on study design, assessment of exposure, assessment of outcome,
control for confounding, and evidence of selection bias (Table A in S1 File). Differences in
data extraction and quality assessment between investigators were infrequent (concordance
>95%) and resolved by consensus.
Statistical analysis
Analyses were conducted using STATA14 (College Station, TX: StataCorp LP). For each pol-
icy, study-specific effect sizes were pooled using inverse-variance random-effects meta-analy-
sis. For interventions with an external control group, we evaluated between-group continuous
changes at follow-up, adjusted for baseline values and relevant covariates; for quasi-experi-
mental studies with no control group, we evaluated within-group changes [34]. Statistical
uncertainty (standard error, SE) was extracted or calculated based on other statistics (Appen-
dix D in S1 File). For paired observations without reported covariance, we used a correlation
of 0.5 for main analysis and 0.1 and 0.9 for sensitivity analyses [34]. In addition to continuous
effect sizes, we extracted other relevant effect sizes (e.g., percentage meeting a cutpoint, odds
ratio, ratio of the means, other relative changes) and their statistical uncertainty. Separate
intervention arms or outcomes from the same study were included as separate estimates in the

 meta-analyses; subgroup findings from the same intervention arm or outcome (e.g., by sex,
age) were first combined using study-specific meta-analysis.
We separately pooled findings for direct provision of healthful foods and beverages, com-
petitive foods and beverage standards, and school meal standards. Effect sizes were standard-
ized to consistent units: e.g., 80 g serving/d for F&V, 12-oz serving/d for SSBs, 8-oz serving
(glass)/d for water, kcal/d for calories, % energy (E)/d, g/d or mg/d for nutrients, and kg/m2 or
z-score for BMI. Endpoints that could not be standardized (e.g., consumption expressed as a
score, proportion of children consuming a given level) or separately meta-analyzed were
included in qualitative assessment of the evidence. When multiple overlapping outcomes were
reported (e.g., fruit with vs. without 100% juice), we extracted the outcome mostly closely
aligned to a standardized definition, e.g. total fruits (fresh, raw, canned, or dried), excluding
fruit juice; total vegetables, excluding white potatoes; and total SSBs (soda, energy drinks,
sweetened teas, etc.). For studies reporting subcomponents of these definitions (e.g., separate
subtypes of vegetables, of sweet snacks, F&V separately), we first summed these subtypes.
Cochran’s Q and I2 statistics assessed between-study heterogeneity [35]. Meta-regression
and stratified/subgroup meta-analysis explored potential prespecified heterogeneity sources
when at least 5 study estimates were present, including design (randomized, quasi-experi-
mental), region (US/Canada, Europe/New Zealand), intervention level (national, statewide,
citywide, local), executing agent (law, governmental policy, program), components (food envi-
ronment policy only, multi-component), follow-up duration (� or <median), school level
(preschool, primary, secondary, mixed), school type (public, private, mixed), outcome de-
finition (primary, alternative), relative contribution of the food environment policy to the
overall intervention (low: 30–59%, medium: 60–89%, high: �90%), type of provision (free vs.
reduced/full cost; direct vs. indirect), targeted caloric intake (yes, no), outcome being a pri-
mary or secondary study endpoint, and study quality score (0–3, 4–5). Potential publication
bias was assessed visually using funnel plots and statistically by Egger’s and Begg’s tests [36].
Results
Study characteristics
Of 6,636 identified articles, 91 interventions met inclusion criteria, including 39 randomized
and 52 nonrandomized studies evaluating 1 or more food environment policy strategy (Fig 1,
Table 1). These included direct provision of healthful foods/beverages (N = 40) [10,37–75],
competitive food/beverage standards (N = 29) [66–72,74–95], and school meal standards
(N = 39) [73–75,90–126]. Most studies were conducted in the US (N = 55), followed by the UK
(N = 11), Netherlands (N = 7), Norway (N = 6), Canada (N = 3), South Korea (N = 2) and oth-
ers (N = 1 each). About half of interventions (N = 49, 54%) were multi-component, with the
relative contribution of the food environment policy component ranging from 30–100%. Data
on race, socioeconomics, response rate, and urban/rural setting were largely not reported.
Longest follow-up was 47 months in randomized and 60 months in quasi-experimental inter-
ventions. Forty-seven intervention studies were in primary schools, 27 in secondary schools, 1
in preschool, and 13 in mixed schools; 1 did not specify. Two studies reported only sustainabil-
ity effects. Given types of outcomes reported, 21 studies were only included in qualitative
assessment.
Direct provision of healthful foods and beverages
Interventions providing healthful foods/beverages were mainly in classrooms (“direct” provi-
sion) or via increased availability in cafeterias, tuck shops or vending machines (“indirect” pro-
vision) (Table 1). F&V were most common.

 Fruits.
Pooling 6 randomized and 9 quasi-experimental interventions with average dura-
tion 12 months, habitual fruit intake increased by 0.27 servings/d (95%CI: 0.17, 0.36) (Fig 2,
Table B in S1 File). Effects were similar in randomized vs. quasi-experimental studies (Table 2,
Figure A in S1 File). Effects appeared potentially higher with free provision [10,37,38,45,50,58,

 59,62,63] vs. reduced [48,71] or full [54,67,73,75] price, but this heterogeneity was not statisti-
cally significant (P = 0.07) (Figure A in S1 File). Findings were also similar in direct provision
only vs. multi-component interventions; or in “direct” (n = 10; 0.29 (0.19, 0.39))
[10,37,38,45,48,50,58,59,62,63] vs. “indirect” (n = 5; 0.21 (-0.02, 0.44)) [54,67,71,73,75] inter-
ventions. Results were similar in 5 studies [10,37,38,45,71] assessing in-school fruit consump-
tion (Table B in S1 File). Three studies [37,50,59] assessed sustainability at 6 weeks [37] or 12
months [50,59] after direct provision was removed; no significant effect was seen (-0.18 (-0.51,
0.15)).
Vegetables.
Pooling 3 randomized and 8 quasi-experimental interventions with average
duration 13.4 months, habitual vegetable intake was slightly increased (0.04 servings/d (0.01,
0.08)) (Fig 2). In 7 interventions providing free vegetables, effects appeared higher, although
this heterogeneity was not statistically significant (P = 0.22) (Table 2, Figure B in S1 File). Find-
ings were similar stratified by other study characteristics and in 3 studies [10,38,45] assessing
in-school intake (Table B in S1 File).
Combined fruits and vegetables.
Sixteen studies (6 randomized, 10 quasi-experimental)
assessed combined F&V intake, with average duration 15.4 months (11 of these studies also
separately evaluated fruits or vegetables, above). Combined intake increased by 0.28 servings/d
(n = 16 (0.17, 0.40)) (Fig 2). Findings were not significantly different in randomized vs. quasi-
experimental studies or by other population or intervention characteristics (Table 2, Figure C

a We included all interventional studies including randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-experimental designs with (QED) or without an external control group
(QED, no C) that assessed the impact of school food environment policy on dietary intake, adiposity, or metabolic outcomes in children. Specific interventions were
represented by more than 1 study if different outcomes (e.g., intake vs content, school vs habitual) were reported.
b School food environment policy interventions included the direct provision of healthful foods and beverages (DP), competitive food and beverage standards (CFS),
and/or school meal standards (SMS).
c Multi-component strategies were included only if the food environment policy was a major component, judged qualitatively to be at least 30% of the overall
intervention. The relative contribution of the food environment policy component to the overall intervention was qualitatively assessed by each reviewer, independently
and in duplicate, based on the number, types, and intensity of additional intervention components, as low (30 to <60%), medium (60 to <90%), and high (�90%).
Single-component strategies received 100%.
d Additional intervention components in multi-component strategies included education (nutrition curricula) (Edu), promotion/ marketing (Mrk), family/ parent
outreach (Fml), point-of-purchase labeling (Lbl), behavioral techniques (Bhv), other environmental change (Env), and economic incentive (Ecn).
e Intervention duration (in months) was estimated from the end of data collection and start date of the intervention as reported. Periods that schools are closed (e.g.,
summer, holidays) were not taken into account in such estimations.
f Quality assessment was performed by review of study design, assessment of exposure, assessment of outcome, control of confounding, and evidence of bias. Each of the
5 quality criteria was evaluated and scored on an integer scale (0 or 1, with 1 being better) and summed; quality scores from 0 to 3 were considered lower quality and 4
to 5 higher quality.
g Additionally or exclusively [39,115] reported sustainability effects (i.e., change in reported outcome after the end of the intervention). Of these, 3 studies [37,50,59]
within the same strategy (DP) could be meta-analyzed for changes in total fruit intake. One study, which published findings separately 1 yr, 3 yrs and 7 yrs after the
intervention was not included in pooled analyses, as the reported outcome was fruit and vegetable intake combined [39,40,42]; and one study reported only
sustainability effects within the SMS strategy [115].
h Studies only included in qualitative assessment.
i Reported only sustainability effects 36 months[42], 84 months [39] and 60 months [115] after the program was terminated; not included in pooled analyses.
j Two intervention arms with overlapping components were available. We included the intervention arm with greatest relative contribution of food environment policy
to the overall intervention.
k Data collection period was not clearly defined.

 in S1 File). In 6 studies assessing in-school consumption [10,38,40,41,45,52], combined F&V
intake increased by 0.38 servings/d (n = 6 (0.23, 0.53)) (Table B in S1 File).
Total calories.
Habitual caloric intake was reported in 6 studies [38,58,61,73–75], yet
wasn’t a target of direct provision in any of these. Pooling studies, no significant effect on
habitual caloric intake was identified (-56 kcal/d; -174, 62) (Table B in S1 File). Only 1 study
reported school caloric intake [56], which was unchanged.
Water.
Five studies increased access to free water mainly through installment of water
coolers [47,53,55,64,65]. Of these, 3 reported nonsignificant trends toward increased habitual
water consumption (0.33 glasses/d (-0.27, 0.93)) [47,55,64] (Table B in S1 File); and 3 reported
changes in uptake, which decreased in 2 studies [55,65] and increased in one [53].
Adiposity and metabolic measures.
Four studies combining provision of fruits and vege-
tables with additional competitive food/beverage standards evaluated overweight or obesity,
with average duration 26.8 months (range 2.3 to 60) [44,66,67,74]. Improvements were not
identified in odds of overweight/obesity (n = 2; 1.04 (0.91, 1.19)) [44,66], overweight (n = 1;
1.03 (0.94, 1.12)) [74], or obesity (n = 2; 1.25 (1.07, 1.46)) [66,74]; BMI (n = 3; 0.19 kg/m2
(-0.12, 0.50)) [44,66,67]; or BMI z-score (n = 2; 0.01 (-0.04, 0.05)) [44,66]. Another 3 studies

 [43,55,60] focusing on water provision reported improvements in BMI z-score [60], prevalence
of overweight/obesity [60] and odds of overweight [55], while obesity prevalence [60] and BMI
percentile were unchanged [43]. Only 1 study [67] evaluated metabolic risk factors, finding sig-
nificant decreases in total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides, and blood pressure.
Other endpoints.
Three studies [46,68,72] evaluated odds of consuming F&V [72] or
varying percentage changes in F&V intakes, reported dichotomously [46,68]; these outcomes
were generally not significantly improved. One study reported only sustainability data for
F&V intake after end-intervention, finding sustained benefits for both in-school intake at 3
years [42] and habitual F&V intake at 3 [42] and 7 years [39] although this weakened over
time. A few interventions provided low-fat/low-calorie items [49,51,69], or milk [57]. No sig-
nificant improvements were found in consumption of low-fat items. A milk provision study in
Iran aimed to increase students’ weight, which was achieved.
Competitive food and beverage standards
Competitive food/beverage policies generally targeted SSBs and unhealthy snacks (Table 1).
Strategies included product-specific restrictions; standards on nutrients, calories, or portion
sizes; or both. All were performed prior to implementation of US national Smart Snacks guide-
lines in 2014.
Sugar-sweetened beverages.
Three interventions found decreased habitual SSB intake of
0.18 servings/d (n = 3 (-0.31, -0.05)) (Fig 3). In contrast, 4 separate studies assessing in-school

a Results are presented for selected heterogeneity sources (common across the three strategies of school food environment policies identified -Tables C and D in S1 File–
with the exception of “Cost of provision”, specific to this strategy only) for the outcomes with the largest numbers of estimates. For all other outcomes not presented, no
significant heterogeneity sources were identified. None of the identified differences by subgroups were statistically significant by meta-regression (P-heterogeneity>0.05
each).
b Number of estimates (n, values in parentheses) can be higher than number of studies (N) included in the meta-analyses if multiple intervention groups or multiple
comparisons were available from the same study
c Study-specific effect sizes were pooled using stratified inverse-variance weighted random-effect models (metan command in STATA). Effect sizes correspond to mean
changes standardized across studies to consistent units; and precision estimates to 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
d Single-component interventions consisted only of the school food environment policy. Multi-component interventions were included only if the food environment
policy was a major component, judged qualitatively to be at least 30% of the overall intervention. Additional potential components included education, food/menu
labeling, etc. (see Table 1).
e In addition to the dietary targets, specific interventions also targeted non-dietary targets, such as physical activity and smoking.
f School food environment policy strategies included direct provision of healthful foods, quality standards for competitive foods/ beverages, and quality standards for
school meals.
g Preschool: 2–4 years old; primary: 5–11 years old; secondary level: 12–18 years old.
h Quality assessment was performed by review of study design, assessment of exposure, assessment of outcome, control of confounding, and evidence of bias. Each of
the 5 quality criteria was evaluated and scored on an integer scale (0 or 1, with 1 being better) and summed; quality scores from 0 to 3 were considered lower quality and
4 to 5 higher quality.
i Provision of fruits and vegetables could be either free (mainly when the intervention included direct provision of fruits and vegetables in the classroom) or it could
come at reduced/full price (mainly when the intervention included indirect provision through increasing the availability of fruits and vegetables in cafeterias, tuck shops
or vending machines).

 intake did not identify a significant effect (n = 5; -0.02 servings/d (-0.04, 0.01)). No significant
heterogeneity sources were identified (Table C and Figure D in S1 File).
Unhealthy snacks.
Two interventions assessed habitual intake, which decreased by 0.17
servings/d (n = 3 (-0.22, -0.13)) (Fig 3). Four studies with 5 separate intervention arms assessed

 in-school intake, which decreased by 0.05 servings/d (n = 9; -0.08, -0.02) (Fig 3). No significant
heterogeneity sources were identified (Table C and Figure D in S1 File).
Total calories.
Habitual caloric intake was reported in 5 studies [74,75,80,86,93], with no
significant effect (-79 kcal/d; -179, 21) (Table B in S1 File). Findings were not significantly dif-
ferent in 2 studies [86,93] that specifically targeted calories (-40 kcal/d; -185, 104) or in 3 (2
additional) studies that assessed in-school lunch caloric intake [86,88,90].
Other targeted dietary factors.
Other targeted diet factors included total fat [88,90] and
saturated fat [86,88] intake; habitual and in-school lunch total fat intake decreased (n = 3), but
not in-school lunch saturated fat intake (n = 2) (Table B in S1 File).
Adiposity and metabolic measures.
Several studies assessed the prevalence or odds ratios
of childhood overweight (n = 6 and n = 6 estimates, respectively), obesity (n = 10, n = 8), or
overweight/obesity (n = 5, n = 2) (Figures G and H in S1 File), as well as BMI (n = 6; Figure I
in S1 File) and BMI z-score (n = 5; Figure J in S1 File). Durations ranged from 2.3 to 69
months (mean 31.5). Competitive food/beverage standards did not significantly reduce any of
these measures (Table B in S1 File), although the central effect estimate often tended to be
slightly and nonsignificantly lower. Prevalence of overweight/obesity was nonsignificantly
higher across 5 studies evaluating this outcome (n = 5; 0.24%; -0.54, 1.02), largely driven
(70.51% of the weighted estimate) by 1 quasi-experimental study [84] that compared changes
in rates among schoolchildren in California (n = ~600,000). Only 2 studies evaluated effects on
metabolic risk factors and could not be pooled [67,91]; individually, these found significant
improvements in various risk factors assessed [67] other than fasting glucose [91].
Other endpoints.
Eight studies [68–70,72,76,85,89,92] reported odds of consuming SSBs
and unhealthy snacks [72], changes in total caloric and total fat meal content [92], or changes
in SSBs and unhealthy snack intakes reported dichotomously (e.g., percentage of sales, preva-
lence of students, score expressing frequency of intake) [68–70,76,85,89] that could not be
meta-analyzed due to outcome heterogeneity. Qualitatively, these studies reported conflicting
findings regarding SSB and unhealthy snack intake, with some reporting decreases [76,85,89],
others showing no change [68–70,72], and one showing unhealthy snack increases [68]; total
caloric and total fat school meal content decreased.
School meal standards
Policies on school meal (mainly lunch) standards (foods, nutrients/energy) generally targeted
F&V, dietary fats, and sodium (Table 1). Five studies evaluated implementation of the 2012 US
school lunch guidelines, while all studies were performed prior to the implementation of the
revised 2015 UK school meal standards.
Fruits and vegetables.
Standards on F&V (e.g., serve at least one fruit or vegetable daily)
generally targeted lunch, either alone or combined with direct provision. Habitual fruit intake
increased by 0.76 servings/d (n = 2 (0.37, 1.16)) [73,102]; with nonsignificant trends toward
increased habitual vegetable (n = 2; 0.30 servings/d (-0.001, 0.59)) [73,102] and F&V (n = 5;
0.12 servings/d (-0.08, 0.31)) consumption (Table B in S1 File) [73,74,95,102,108]. Findings
were similar restricting to 3 studies [95,102,108] that did not include direct provision (n = 3;
0.23 servings/d of F&V; (-0.06, 0.51)). In one study assessing prevalence of students selecting
F&V in lunch [117], fruit selection increased, while vegetable selection decreased.
Dietary fats.
Most studies specified target levels for dietary fats, which were generally con-
sistent across studies; these ranged from 30–35%E/lunch for total fat and 10–11%E/lunch for
saturated fat. Six studies assessed habitual total fat, which decreased by 1.49%E (-2.42, -0.57)
(Fig 4). In g/d, the reduction in habitual fat intake was greater (~6 g/d total fat) in magnitude
to achieved reductions in in-school meal content and intake (~3–4 g/d total fat) (Figure K in

 S1 File). Standards also reduced habitual saturated fat (n = 4; -0.93%E (-1.15, -0.70)), in-school
lunch saturated fat (n = 9; -2.75%E (-4.39, -1.11)), and in-school meal (lunch or breakfast)

least 30% of the overall intervention. The relative contribution of the food environment policy component to the overall intervention was qualitatively assessed as low (30
to <60%), medium (60 to <90%), and high (�90%). In secondary analysis, in-school meal (lunch or breakfast) consumption decreased for total fat by 7.12% energy (%E)/
d (N = 10; -9.48, -4.75) and for saturated fat by 2.46%E/d (N = 10; -4.04, -0.89). RCT, randomized controlled trial; QED, quasi-experimental intervention with external

 saturated fat (n = 10; -2.46%E (-4.04, -0.89)) (Table B in S1 File). Again, absolute magnitudes
of reduction were marginally higher for habitual intake (~3 g/d) compared with in-school
meal intake and content (~1–2 g/d) (Figure L in S1 File). No significant heterogeneity sources
were identified, with the exception of study region for in-school total fat intake (P = 0.042);
larger reduction was observed for studies in Europe/New Zealand compared to US/Canada
(Table D and Figures E and F in S1 File).
Total calories.
School meal standards did not significantly decrease habitual caloric intake
(n = 8; -38 kcal/d (-137, 62), in-school (lunch) calories (n = 11; -28 kcal/d (-76, 20)), or in-
school (lunch+breakfast) calories (n = 12; -29 kcal/d (-76, 18)) (Figure M and Table B in S1
File). Results were similar in interventions specifically targeting total calories by aiming to pro-
vide adequate amounts of energy (habitual: n = 4; -19 kcal/d (-134, 95); in-school: n = 5; -60
kcal/d (-170, 50)). The magnitude of reduction was larger and significant for in-school meal
content than for in-school meal intake or habitual intake (Figure M in S1 File). Differences
were seen by study quality score for in-school lunch caloric intake (P = 0.01) but not for habit-
ual caloric intake; nor for other heterogeneity sources (Table D in S1 File).
Sodium intake.
Target levels for sodium content in school meals varied across studies,
ranging from 200–1200 mg/meal. School meal standards for sodium decreased habitual intake
(n = 4; -170 mg/d (-242, -98)), in-school lunch intake (n = 6; -227 mg/d (-384, -69)), and in-
school meal (lunch+breakfast) intake (n = 7; -221 mg/d (-371, -71)) (Figure N and Table B in S1
File). The magnitude of reduction in sodium was similar for in-school meal content (Figure N
in S1 File). No significant sources of heterogeneity were identified (Table D in S1 File).
Other targeted dietary factors.
A few interventions set meal standards for other targets
such as milk (one serving/d of milk/milk products; n = 2) [74,95], dietary fiber (grain-based
foods with �2 g/serving of fiber; n = 7) [74,92,93,104,120–122], whole grains (increase whole
grains, e.g., by 1 daily serving; n = 5) [74,92,101,102,104], or total carbohydrates (> = 50% of
food energy; n = 3) [74,109,120]. These studies found increased habitual consumption of milk/
milk products (0.22 cups/d; 0.17, 0.28) and in-school lunch consumption of carbohydrate
(8.17%E/d; 0.70, 15.65), but not habitual or lunch intakes of dietary fiber (0.08 g/d (-0.84,
1.00); 0.55 (-1.90, 3.00); respectively) or habitual or lunch intakes of whole grains (0.14 serv-
ings/d (-0.11, 0.39); 0.49 (-0.37, 1.35); respectively). Three studies (n = 5 estimates) targeted
the proportion of schoolchildren selecting “less healthy” options (e.g., desserts, high-fat
entrees, starchy foods in oil) [99,109,113]; no significant effects were seen (Table B in S1 File).
Adiposity and metabolic measures.
Six studies evaluated effects of school meal standards
on adiposity, with average duration 34.3 months (range 4 to 60) [74,91,94,97,98,110]. Three of
these [74,91,94] also combined competitive food/beverage standards. Two studies [97,110]
assessed changes in BMI percentile, which decreased (-1.01, -1.62, -0.39), while other adiposity
measures evaluated were unchanged (Table B in S1 File).
Other endpoints.
Two studies reported dichotomous changes in healthy food (e.g., fruit,
vegetable, bread, milk, cereal [98,112], reported as % meeting a threshold) that could not be
meta-analyzed due to varying cutpoints. Results were conflicting, with a reduced overall
healthy food score and a higher intake of healthy items at breakfast [112]. One study [115]
reported only sustainability data, evaluating total calories, total fat, and saturated fat in lunches
5 years after school meal standards were removed, finding further decreases in %E from total
and saturated fat, but increased caloric content.
Publication bias
Visual inspection of funnel plots provided little evidence for publication bias (Figures O-Q in
S1 File). Begg’s or Eggers test did not identify statistical evidence for publication bias.

 Discussion
This systematic review and meta-analysis is the first, to our knowledge, to determine quantita-
tive effects of school food environment policies on children’s habitual dietary intakes in inter-
ventional studies. Direct provision policies increased fruit intake by 0.27 servings/d and
vegetable intake by 0.04 servings/d, but not water intake. Competitive food/beverage standards
reduced SSBs by 0.18 servings/d and unhealthy snacks by 0.17 servings/d. School meal stan-
dards increased fruit intake by 0.76 servings/d, reduced total fat intake by ~1.5% energy and
saturated fat intake by ~1% energy, and reduced sodium by 170 mg/d. All of these policies
influenced dietary composition, without altering total calories. Measures of adiposity were
generally unchanged; and few studies assessed metabolic factors, with mixed findings.
We separately evaluated in-school vs. habitual intakes to determine effects on children’s overall
nutritional habits, given potential for compensatory changes outside of school. For example,
restricting SSBs or unhealthy snacks at school could lead to increased consumption after school or
at home. Such compensation is suggested in some cases; for instance, school meal standards sig-
nificantly reduced meal calorie content, but not in-school meal calorie intake or habitual calorie
intake. Conversely, reductions were similar for in-school vs. habitual sodium intake, suggesting
that sodium reduction at school does not lead to meaningful compensation elsewhere. For some
policy outcomes, e.g. for competitive food standards and SSBs and snacks, the pooled findings
from interventions evaluating in-school effects were smaller than those evaluating habitual
intakes. These were generally different studies, suggesting possibly other differences in the types of
studies evaluating in-school intakes. Overall, our results support the importance of schools as a
setting to improve overall dietary habits of children within and outside school.
Our findings suggest efficacy of a range of food environment policies, including direct pro-
vision, competitive food/beverage standards, and school meal standards. The results for both
direct provision and school meal standards suggest greater efficacy for fruit intake, compared
with vegetables; consistent with greater palatability of many fruits and generally less need for
preparation or cooking. Water intake was unchanged in the limited studies that assessed this
outcome, likely further due to difficulties in assessing fluid intake and measurement error.
Our findings further highlight key gaps for many other dietary targets, such as other healthier
foods (e.g., legumes, whole grains, fish, yogurt) or less healthy foods (e.g., processed meats) or
other nutrients of concern (e.g., calcium, vitamin D, potassium, unsaturated fats, fiber). Given
updated Dietary Guidelines for Americans that focus on healthier foods, overall diet patterns,
and specific nutrients of concern [127], future studies are needed to assess how school food
environment policies impact these priorities.
Evidence on the health impact of policies targeting the school food environment is espe-
cially relevant and timely given the potentially evolving priorities of the new federal US admin-
istration. Congress did not reauthorize the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act (HHFKA) as
scheduled in Sept 2015, so the future of Smart Snack Standards, now covering 99% of public
and 83% of private schools [12], remains uncertain. Further, current policy debates include a
focus on weakening or eliminating national school lunch standards [15,16]. A recent analysis
indicated that in-school selections have improved with the new lunch standards [128]. Our
findings build upon and expand this prior work by demonstrating changes in actual habitual
intake, further supporting efficacy of meal and snack standards and informing ongoing
debates. Similarly, the current national FFVP only applies to elementary schools with high pro-
portions of low-income students [9], about 4 million students across the US [129]. Our investi-
gation supports efficacy of such direct provision programs, which should be considered for a
broader range of elementary, middle, and high schools. Finally, while identified dietary im-
provements were meaningful at a population level, these will not fully address the suboptimal

 diets of most children. Thus, our results confirm a need for multiple programmatic and policy
interventions, including within and outside schools, to improve children’s diets.
While several dietary benefits were confirmed, changes in adiposity metrics were generally
not significant. This may be because such policies improve dietary quality or composition
(more relevant for general and metabolic health) but not dietary quantity (more relevant for
obesity, at least in the short- to intermediate-term). Because dietary composition influences
numerous pathways for health and well-being, the absence of a documented effect on obesity
does not preclude efficacy of these interventions. Few studies evaluated metabolic risk factors,
for which improvements may be more readily detected compared with adiposity. Also, estab-
lishing lifelong healthier dietary habits may have benefits decades later, during adulthood. Our
findings provide quantitative summaries of how school food environment policies affect spe-
cific dietary targets, allowing modeling of potential effects on childhood obesity and future
diets and disease risk in adulthood.
Prior reviews of a more varied range of school interventions identified effects of similar
magnitude for total F&V consumption [18,19,21]. A previous systematic review on competi-
tive foods/beverages was qualitative, and included mostly cross-sectional studies in the US
alone [24]. Similarly, another systematic review on school food environment was also qualita-
tive, excluded direct provision studies, and grouped together various heterogenous interven-
tions [23]. Importantly, most prior reviews did not specifically evaluate potential effects of
school food environment interventions on dietary intakes, and have grouped together highly
varied programs potentially leading to biased inferences [26–32]. Our findings extend these
results by specifically evaluating school food environment policies and quantifying their effects
on dietary intakes, as well as separately evaluating direct provision, competitive food/beverage
standards, and school meal standards with careful consideration of potential heterogeneity.
We also looked for sustainability: while few studies were identified, the results suggested that
dietary improvements are difficult to sustain if school food environment policies are cancelled.
Our evaluation has several strengths. Evidence was based on interventions, most of which
were randomized, increasing reliance in validity of results. We evaluated changes in diet, adi-
posity, and metabolic risk factors, providing a more coherent and comprehensive picture of
the evidence. We focused on habitual (within and outside school) dietary intakes, rather than
in-school intake alone. A systematic search of multiple databases made it less likely that major
relevant reports were missed. Standardized methods and analytic techniques and duplicate full
text reviews and data extractions reduced errors and bias. Standardization of interventions
and outcomes facilitated quantitative pooling. We explored multiple factors for potential mod-
ifying effects.
Potential limitations should be considered. Educational systems and schools vary within
and across nations, which could contribute to unmeasured heterogeneity. Intensity or success
of policy implementation could modify results, but these are difficult to quantify; e.g., due to
varying professional education or technical assistance for food service directors; differences in
how schools prepare, offer, sell, serve, or purchase food; and policy nutritional guidelines.
Most studies did not report details by socioeconomic indicators, which could modify efficacy
of some programs. Costs and cost-effectiveness were generally not reported. Several studies
included other intervention components that might contribute to impact. Some studies were
judged to have lower quality scores, that could weaken or bias results. Evaluation of heteroge-
neity and publication bias is dependent on total numbers of studies, limiting statistical power
for some endpoints. Most studies were from high-income Western countries, highlighting the
need for research in lower-income nations.
In conclusion, this systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrates that specific school
food environment policy interventions can improve targeted dietary behaviors. These findings
