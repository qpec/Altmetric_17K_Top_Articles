Genome sequencing has provided snapshots of the transmission of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus
(MRSA) during suspected outbreaks in isolated hospital wards. Scale-up to populations is now required to establish
the full potential of this technology for surveillance. We prospectively identified all individuals over a 12-month
period who had at least one MRSA-positive sample processed by a routine diagnostic microbiology laboratory in
the East of England, which received samples from three hospitals and 75 general practitioner (GP) practices. We
sequenced at least 1 MRSA isolate from 1465 individuals (2282 MRSA isolates) and recorded epidemiological data.
An integrated epidemiological and phylogenetic analysis revealed 173 transmission clusters containing between 2
and 44 cases and involving 598 people (40.8%). Of these, 118 clusters (371 people) involved hospital contacts alone,
27 clusters (72 people) involved community contacts alone, and 28 clusters (157 people) had both types of contact.
Community- and hospital-associated MRSA lineages were equally capable of transmission in the community, with
instances of spread in households, long-term care facilities, and GP practices. Our study provides a comprehensive
picture of MRSA transmission in a sampled population of 1465 people and suggests the need to review existing
infection control policy and practice.
INTRODUCTION
Staphylococcusaureus isresponsibleforahighproportionofcommunity-
associated invasive and soft tissue infections and is a leading cause of
health care–associated infections (1). This burden is compounded by
infection with methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), which results
inincreasedmortality andhospitalization costsandlongerhospitalstays
compared to methicillin-susceptible S. aureus infections (2). Successful
reduction of MRSA infection rates depends on preventing MRSA trans-
mission and detecting and containing outbreaks (3). Understanding
the settings and circumstances under which MRSA evades current in-
fection control measures is central to designing new strategies to reduce
transmission.
MRSA carriage and infection have historically been associated with
health care settings. Recent studies have demonstrated the value of ap-
plying whole-genome sequencing to define the spread of MRSA (4–10)
and a range of other pathogens in hospitals. Whole-genome sequencing
provides the ultimate resolution to discriminate between bacterial iso-
lates and, when combined with epidemiological data, enables the recon-
struction of transmissionnetworks.Previousstudies have largelyfocused
on suspected outbreaks (4–6) or transmission in high-risk settings such
as intensive care units (7–10). These snapshots have confirmed the
potential of whole-genome sequencing to confirm or refute outbreaks,
but the value that could be derived from applying this to entire popula-
tions, including those that bridge the divide between hospitals and the
community, is unknown. Here, we report the findings of a 12-month
prospective study of all MRSA-positive individuals detected by a large
diagnostic microbiology laboratory in the East of England in which an
integrated analysis of epidemiological and sequence data provided a full
picture of MRSA transmission.
RESULTS
Study participants and MRSA isolates
We identified 1465 MRSA-positive individuals in the East of England
over a 12-month period (April 2012 to April 2013) by screening all
samples submitted to a diagnostic microbiology laboratory by three
hospitals and 75 general practitioner (GP) practices (see Fig. 1 for
geographical distribution). Cases had a median age of 68 years
[range, newborns to 101 years; interquartile range (IQR), 46 to
82 years]. We sequenced 2282 isolates cultured from their multisite
screens (n = 1619) or diagnostic specimens (n = 663), which equated
to 1 isolate from 1006 cases and a median of 2 isolates (range, 2 to
15; IQR, 2 to 3) from 459 cases (see Supplementary Materials and
Methods for rationale for selecting isolates for sequencing and fig. S1
for number of isolates sequenced per case). About 80% of sequenced
MRSA isolates were from samples submitted by the three study hos-
pitals (1453 multisite screens and 372 diagnostic specimens), with the
remainder submitted by GP practices (166 multisite screens and 291
diagnostic specimens). Multilocus sequence types (STs) were derived
from sequence data, which revealed that most of the isolates be-
longed to clonal complex (CC) 22 (1667 of 2282, 73%), the predom-
inant health care–associated lineage in the UK (11). This was followed
in frequency by CC30 (n = 129, 5.6%), CC5 (n = 108, 4.7%), CC1 (n =
105, 4.6%), and CC8 (n = 87, 3.8%) (see table S1 for CC designation
of the entire collection). Supplementary Materials and Methods
provides a detailed description of the patient data collected, micro-
biology, sequencing methodology, and sequence data analyses, and
fig. S2 shows a flowchart summarizing the data types used and
analyses.

 Integration of genomic and epidemiological data
We initially divided the 2282 MRSA isolates into clusters containing
isolates that were no more than 50 single-nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) different based on core genome comparisons (Supplemen-
tary Materials and Methods describes the rationale for the cutoff
used). This led to the identification of 173 separate phylogenetic
clusters. MRSA isolated from more than half of cases (785 of 1465,
53.6%) was genetically linked to MRSA from at least one other case
based on isolates belonging to the same cluster. The next step was to
apply epidemiological data (hospital admission and ward movement
data, GP registration, and residential postcode) to this clustering
framework to determine links between cases within each cluster,
which ignored the traditional categorization of lineages as community-
or hospital-associated. Figure S3 provides an overview of how the
bacterial phylogeny and patient epidemiological data were integrated
to define and classify transmission clusters. This revealed that 598 of
785 (76.2%) cases had an identifiable MRSA-positive contact with at
least one other study case in a hospital setting and/or in the commu-
nity (Table 1).
It is possible for epidemiological links between MRSA-positive in-
dividuals to arise by chance when MRSA carriers are admitted to hos-
pital wards or other health care facilities
with a high patient turnover or a propor-
tionatelyhigherprevalenceofMRSAcases
than the hospital- or community-averaged
baseline. To assess the potential impact of
this, we determined the strength of epide-
miological links between people with ge-
netically unrelated isolates (separated by
more than 50 SNPs). This was achieved
by a systematic pairwise comparison of
1040 cases with MRSA CC22. A total
of 540,280 unique pairwise case compar-
isons were made, of which 534,417 had
more than 50 SNPs (table S2). The in-
stances of shared wards, GP practices,
and postcodes were uncommon (wards/
GP practices) or very rare (postcodes) for
case pairs positive for unrelated CC22
MRSA (table S2). This analysis led us to
classify shared postcodes (present in
0.04% of genetically unrelated cases), GP
practice, and ward contacts (<1% of genet-
ically unrelated cases) other than the Acci-
dent and Emergency Department (6.91%)
as strong epidemiological links. Admission
to the same hospital (particularly hospital
A) was common in unrelated cases and
considered a weak epidemiological link.
Eachcase was paired withthe individ-
ual whose MRSA isolate was the closest
genetic match, after which the genetic
distance between each MRSA pair was
plotted against six different categories
of epidemiological contact (Fig. 2). This
demonstrated a direct relationship be-
tween bacterial relatedness and strength
of epidemiological contact.
Evidence of MRSA transmission in the community
Twelve percent of cases (72 of 598) with both bacterial and epidemio-
logical links could be resolved into 27 distinct community transmission
clusters. MRSA lineages regarded as community-associated (CA-
MRSA)—which in the UK included CC1, CC5, CC8, CC45, and
CC80—were associated with nine separate community transmission
clusters(Table 1). However, most community clustersinvolvedhospital-
associated lineages [17 separate CC22 clusters involving 50 of 72 cases
(69%) and 1 CC30 cluster involving 3 of 72 cases (4%)]. To contextualize
the MRSA CC22 isolates associated with transmission in the communi-
ty, we constructed a phylogenetic tree containing all CC22 study isolates.
This showed that CC22 associated with community clusters was
scattered throughout the phylogenetic tree, interspersed with clusters as-
sociated with cases with hospital contacts alone (Fig. 3). This indicates
that CC22 isolates that were transmitted in the community belonged to
the wider CC22 population, with no evidence for specific genetic subsets.
We also identified transmission clusters relating to three independent
GP practices, the largest of which contained 13 cases. All cases with
shared postcodes were further investigated to determine whether they
shared a residential address. This confirmed that MRSA transmis-
sion had occurred in at least 11 separate households (25 cases) and in

practices (n = 75), and postcode districts are shown for the 1465 study cases. Postcode districts are color-coded to show
the number of MRSA-positive cases sampled in each district. A total of 5,012,137 residents lived in the highlighted
districts (16,240 km2) according to the 2011 UK Census.

of exemplars of transmission at a GP practice, long-term care facility,

Evidence of MRSA transmission in hospitals
More than half of cases with epidemiological and bacterial genomic
links (371 of 598, 62%) resided in transmission clusters with hospital
contacts, of which 255 cases had ward contacts. The 371 cases were
resolved into 118 different clusters each involving between 2 and 44
individuals (Table 1). We narrowed down further investigation to
those clusters that contained five or more patients (nine clusters; see
table S3 for details) and evaluated these for instances of direct ward
contact (same ward, overlapping admission dates) or indirect ward
contact (same ward, no overlap in admission dates). Where available,
Table 1. Epidemiological classification of transmission clusters. Columns are ordered based on decreasing proportion of isolates in each CC. Each cell shows
the number of cases and (in parentheses) the number of transmission clusters to which these cases were assigned. The number of transmission clusters in
each category is the sum of those of its subcategories. The same applies to the number of cases except for columns “CC22” and “Overall.” A total of seven cases
had two different CC22 strains suggestive of mixed colonization or strain replacement that linked them to two different transmission clusters. This explains
why the total number of genetically clustered cases (n = 578) is lower than the sum of cases in its subcategories. CCs with genetically unrelated isolates
or identified in a single individual from the study population are not shown. “Multiple hospitals” refers to epidemiological contacts from more than one of the
three study hospitals (A, B, and C).

 the presence of a negative MRSA culture followed by a positive MRSA
culture was interpreted as additional evidence of hospital acquisition.
The specific ward where MRSA had been putatively acquired could be
determined in three of the nine clusters, one of which is depicted in
Fig. 4A. This ward-centric pattern occurred in two different hospitals
and across different CCs (CC22, CC30, and CC15). Notably, we ob-
served that there was a time delay between presumptive acquisition
date and first clinical detection of MRSA positivity in most cases
(six of eight, three of four, and three of five patients). For the remain-
ing six hospital clusters, multiple wards in the same hospital were
plausible places of acquisition. We also observed a pattern of transmis-
sion that centered around specific individuals in which the movement
of a single, persistently MRSA-positive index patient through multiple
wards resulted in MRSA acquisition by numerous other patients. This
patient-centric pattern of transmission was identified in three trans-
mission clusters (Fig. 4B and fig. S2, E and F) and was observed in two
different hospitals and for two CCs (CC22 and CC30). Acquisition by
other cases was associated with a high rate of indirect ward acquisition.
MRSA transmission at the hospital-community interface
We identified 28 clusters (157 cases) that contained a mixture of people
with community and hospital epidemiological links (Table 1). Further
analysis of 15 clusters that contained five or more cases (detailed in table
S3) revealed instances of community-onset transmission followed by
onward nosocomial dissemination, and hospital-onset transmission
followed by nosocomial and community spread in CC30 and CC22
clusters. A pictorial representation of exemplars of these transmission
patterns is shown in fig. S4 (D to F).

 DISCUSSION
Our findings have important implications for infection control policy
and practice. MRSA transmission in our study population was not
attributable to large nosocomial outbreaks but resulted from the cumu-
lative effect of numerous clinically unrecognized episodes. We detected
173 separate genetic clusters that mapped to numerous different lo-
cations over the course of 12 months, which is indicative of repeated
lapses in infection control. There are several explanations for exten-
sive unrecognized transmission, including lack of hospital discharge
swabbing and the fact that place of acquisition is often different to the
place of detection and separated by a period of days, weeks, or months.
This indicates the need for outbreak investigations to widen their scope
in time and place when considering potential MRSA contacts.
Standard infection control practice centered on a ward-based ap-
proach may also fail to detect the impact of longitudinal patient-centric
transmission. We identified a critical role for some persistent carriers
who spread MRSA in multiple wards during complex health care path-
ways. This frequently involved indirect transmission, in which apparent
acquisition by a new case occurred after the index case had left the ward,
which issuggestive of environmentalcontamination orcolonizedhealth
care workers. Further studies are needed to identify host factors respon-
sible for persistent carriage associated with a high risk of MRSA trans-
mission to facilitate risk stratification and targeted allocation of isolation
facilities where these are a limited resource.
It is generally accepted that most of the MRSA lineages either have
become adapted to persist and spread in hospitals or are sufficiently fit
to compete with other S. aureus lineages associated with community-
associatedcarriage(12).CC22isthepredominanthealthcare–associated
MRSA lineage in the UK (~70%) followed in frequency by CC30, and
most ongoing MRSA transmission is assumed to occur in health care
settings. We expected that most clusters caused by CC22 and CC30
MRSA would map to hospitals but instead found considerable CC22
transmission in the community. Furthermore, clusters associated with
community transmission of MRSA CC22 were distributed across the
CC22 phylogeny and were interspersed with hospital-related clusters.
This provides definitive evidence for the spread of so-called hospital-
associated lineages such as CC22 through transmission networks that
include the community. The repeated introduction of MRSA from the
community into hospitals and vice versa signals the need for more robust
action to detect and tackle community-associated carriage.
By including patient epidemiological information, we found that
residential postcodes and GP registration information were strong
epidemiological markers of MRSA transmission. Sharing the same
postcode or GP practice by two or more MRSA-positive patients often

including admission overlaps. Notably, the putative epicenter of transmission was in ward B2 or B21, but the outbreak strain was isolated on later admissions in six of the eight
patients, three of which (1090, 727, and 762) were first detected at a different hospital (hospital A) from where they had putatively acquired this strain (that is, in hospital B).
(B) Patient-centric pattern. Six patients had stayed in wards visited by patient 388 (that is, A49, A80, and A59) before their MRSA isolation date. Negative MRSA screens before entry
to these wards for some patients (1288, 1057, 1488, 1377, and 942) further support hospital acquisition. Isolates from patient 388 were the most basal in the phylogenetic tree, and
their diversity enclosed that of isolates from the other patients, providing further indicators for this patient being the potential source for the transmission cluster. Colored blocks
other than gray represent ward contacts, which are labeled by a letter to denote the hospital (A or B) and a number that denotes the anonymized ward.

 indicated an outbreak, some of which spanned several months. Our
findings support the routine collection of postcodes and GP registra-
tion as an integral part of routine surveillance to capture putative
MRSA outbreaks in the community. This could guide a targeted ap-
proach to the use of whole-genome sequencing to confirm or refute
transmission and direct infection control interventions that would cur-
tail further dissemination.
We acknowledge several limitations of this study. The study design
did not include longitudinal or discharge MRSA screening in hospitals
or screening of environmental reservoirs and health care workers.
Furthermore, sampling of the community was opportunistic and relied
on samples submitted to the diagnostic microbiology laboratory. We
acknowledge that this wouldmean failure to detect some MRSA carriers
involved in our transmission clusters and that undetected carriers result
in incomplete transmission routes being reconstructed. Nonsampled
carriers explain why the MRSA isolate from 680 cases was not linked
to the MRSA from any other case and why 193 cases whose isolate
resided in a genetic cluster had no identifiable epidemiological contact.
Despite detecting multiple transmission clusters, we are also likely to
have underestimated the full extent of MRSA transmission attributable
to nosocomial and community sources because of undersampling of the
entire population served by the diagnostic laboratory at Cambridge
University Hospitals.
In conclusion, we provide evidence for the value of integrated
epidemiological and genomic surveillance of a population that accesses
the same health care referral network in the East of England. The large
number of patients screened here allowed us to sample MRSA lineages
that are not dominant in the UK but are endemic in other areas of the
world including USA300 (prevalent in the United States) (13), the
European CA-MRSA CC80 (14), and the Taiwanese CC59 clone (prev-
alent in Asia) (15). The identification of transmission clusters involving
these lineages in hospitals, in the community, and at the hospital-
community interface suggests that our findings may be applicable to
other UK regions and other countries.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design
We conducted a 12-month prospective observational cohort study
between April 2012 and April 2013 to identify consecutive individuals
with MRSA-positive samples processed by the Clinical Microbiology
and Public Health Laboratory at the Cambridge University Hospitals
NHS Foundation Trust. This facility received samples from three
hospitals (referred to as A, B, and C) and 75 GP practices in the East
of England. All hospital inpatients were routinely screened for MRSA
on admission to hospital, and screening was repeated weekly in critical
care units. Compliance with mandatory admission screening at the
three study hospitals was 85 to 90%. Additional clinical specimens were
taken as part of routine clinical care. In the community, there was no
formal MRSA screening, and specimens were taken by GPs or com-
munity nursing teams for clinical purposes, meaning that coverage was
not complete. Epidemiological data (including hospital ward stays and
residential postcodes) were recorded for all MRSA-positive cases.
Detailed methodology is provided in Supplementary Materials and
Methods, and a flowchart summarizing the data types and analyses
undertaken is shown in fig. S2. The study protocol was approved by the
National Research Ethics Service (reference 11/EE/0499), the National
Information Governance Board Ethics and Confidentiality Committee
(reference ECC 8-05(h)/2011), and the Cambridge University Hospitals
NHS Foundation Trust Research and Development Department
(reference A092428).
DNA sequencing and genomic analyses
A total of 3053 MRSA isolates were collected during the study, of which
2320 were selected for whole-genome sequencing. A detailed descrip-
tion of the rationale for selecting isolates for sequencing and genomic
methodologies is provided in Supplementary Materials and Methods.
In brief, DNA was extracted, libraries were prepared, and 100–base pair
paired end sequences were determined for 2320 isolates on an Illumina
HiSeq2000, as previously described (11). Of these, 2282 were further
analyzed after passing quality control (see Supplementary Materials
and Methods). Genomes were de novo assembled using Velvet (16). STs
were derived from assemblies, and CCs were assigned. All isolates
assigned to the same CC were mapped using SMALT (www.sanger.ac.
uk/science/tools/smalt-0) to the most closely related reference genome.
SNPs were identified from BAM files using SAMtools (17). SNPs at re-
gions annotated as mobile genetic elements were removed from whole-
genome alignments, and maximum likelihood trees were created using
RAxML (18) for each CC. Pairwise genetic distances between isolates of
the same CC were calculated on the basis of the number of SNPs in the
core genome. Sequence data were submitted to the European Nucleo-
tide Archive (www.ebi.ac.uk/ena) under the accession numbers listed in
data file S1.
Epidemiological analysis
We established epidemiological links between each pair of MRSA-
positive individuals (termed case pairs) through a systematic compari-
son. Hospital contacts were categorized as follows: direct ward contact,
if a case pair was admitted to the same ward with overlapping dates of
admission; indirect ward contact, if admitted to the same ward with no
overlapping dates; direct hospital-wide contact, if admitted to the same
hospital in different wardswithoverlapping dates;andindirect hospital-
wide contact, if admitted to the same hospital in different wards with no
overlapping dates. We identified episodes of hospital admission for each
case in the 12-month period before their first MRSA-positive sample.
Information on outpatient clinic appointments was not available. Com-
munity contact was classified if cases shared a postcode or had their
MRSA-positive sample submitted by the same GP practice. Commu-
nity contacts were further categorized as follows: household contact,
if people shared a residential address; long-term care facility contact, if
they lived in the same long-term care facility; or GP contact, if they were
registered with the same GP practice. Information on GP visits was not
available other than that recorded for cases with MRSA swabs collected
at GP practices. In a few instances, cases shared the same postcode
but lived at a different residential address. In a minority of cases, patient
addresses could not be retrieved from clinical records and were clas-
sified as “unresolved.” We studied cases positive for MRSA CC22 to
determine the frequency of different types of epidemiological contact
among genetically unrelated cases, using a pairwise SNP distance
greater than 50 SNPs. This analysis led us to consider epidemiological
links as strong if they were ward contacts (other than Accident and
Emergency visits), GP contacts, or shared postcodes, and weak if they
were hospital-wide contacts and Accident and Emergency visits (see
Supplementary Materials and Methods for details).
Identification of putative MRSA transmission
Selecting a SNP cutoff to define MRSA transmission clusters was
informed by two independent lines of evidence. First, we established

 the genetic diversity of the same MRSA clone in a single individual
(pool of diversity) in 26 cases with more than one isolate (range, 2 to 3;
median, 2) from independent samples cultured on the same day. The
maximum genetic distance of MRSA in each case ranged from 0 to 41
SNPs (median, 2; IQR, 1 to 3), which is comparable to the maximum
within-hostdiversity reported elsewhere (19–21). Inparallel, we selected
the single largest phylogenetic cluster containing isolates from cases
with strong epidemiological links (13 cases, a putative outbreak) and
established that the pairwise genetic distance between cases ranged
from 0 to 48 SNPs. We constructed CC-based phylogenetic trees and
then subdivided each tree into clusters based on a SNP distance of no
more than 50 and looked for hospital and community contacts between
cases residing in the same genetic cluster. Clusters were categorized as
containing community contacts alone, hospital contacts alone, commu-
nity and hospital contacts, or no known hospital/community contacts.
For clusters with hospital and/or community contacts involving five or
more cases, we incorporated individual patient movement data (for in-
patients), sampling dates, MRSA screen results, and bacterial phylogeny
to identify the most plausible MRSA source. Supplementary Materials
and Methods and figs. S2 and S3 describe in more detail how genomic
and epidemiological data were integrated to identify and classify trans-
mission clusters.
