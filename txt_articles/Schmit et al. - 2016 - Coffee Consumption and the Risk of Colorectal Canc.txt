Abstract
Background: Coffee contains several bioactive compounds
relevant to colon physiology. Although coffee intake is a proposed
protective factor for colorectal cancer, current evidence remains
inconclusive.
Methods: We investigated the association between coffee con-
sumption and risk of colorectal cancer in 5,145 cases and 4,097
controls from the Molecular Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer
(MECC) study, a population-based case–control study in north-
ern Israel. We also examined this association by type of coffee, by
cancer site (colon and rectum), and by ethnic subgroup (Ashke-
nazi Jews, Sephardi Jews, and Arabs). Coffee data were collected
by interview using a validated, semi-quantitative food frequency
questionnaire.
Results: Coffee consumption was associated with 26% lower
odds of developing colorectal cancer [OR (drinkers vs. non-
drinkers), 0.74; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.64–0.86;
P < 0.001]. The inverse association was also observed for decaf-
feinated coffee consumption alone (OR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.68–0.99;
P ¼ 0.04) and for boiled coffee (OR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.71–0.94;
P ¼ 0.004). Increasing consumption of coffee was associated with
lower odds of developing colorectal cancer. Compared with <1
serving/day, intake of 1 to <2 servings/day (OR, 0.78; 95% CI,
0.68–0.90; P < 0.001), 2 to 2.5 servings/day (OR, 0.59; 95% CI,
0.51–0.68; P < 0.001), and >2.5 servings/day (OR, 0.46; 95% CI,
0.39–0.54; P < 0.001) were associated with significantly lower
odds of colorectal cancer (Ptrend < 0.001), and the dose–response
trend was statistically significant for both colon and rectal cancers.
Conclusions: Coffee consumption may be inversely associated
with risk of colorectal cancer in a dose–response manner.
Impact: Global coffee consumption patterns suggest potential
health benefits of the beverage for reducing the risk of colorectal
cancer. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev; 25(4); 634–9. �2016 AACR.
Introduction
Coffee is one of the most widely consumed beverages in the
world (1, 2). It contains many potentially bioactive components
that are relevant to colon physiology, including polyphenols
(mainly chlorogenic acids), melanoidins, diterpenes, and caf-
feine, among others (3, 4). Although the levels of these com-
pounds vary by species of coffee bean, degree of roasting, brewing
technique, and serving size, exposure to one or more of them
may promote colon health via anti-mutagenic or antioxidant
properties, reduction of bile acid secretion, modification of
microbiome composition, and/or enhancement of critical bowel
functions (e.g., motility, stool output; ref. 3). Based on the
potential benefits of coffee's biochemical components, the bev-
erage has been proposed as a protective agent for colorectal cancer,
the third most common cancer in males and in females in the
United States (5) and the fourth most common cause of cancer
death worldwide (6).
Despite the biologic plausibility of coffee's chemopreventive
properties, epidemiologic evidence of an association between
coffee intake and the risk of colorectal cancer remains inconclu-
sive. Existing evidence generally supports an inverse association,
but results reported in the literature vary by study design (case–
control vs. cohort), cancer site (colon vs. rectum), sex, and
ethnicity (3, 7–18). The most recent meta-analysis considered
25 case–control studies and 16 cohort studies with over 25,000
cases (14). This meta-analysis observed suggestive evidence of an
inverse association in cohort studies, whereas case–control stud-
ies showed that the highest category of coffee consumption was
associated with a statistically significant 15% to 21% lower risk of
colorectal cancer or colon cancer (not rectal cancer) as compared
with the lowest category of consumption. Further, a growing body
of evidence suggests coffee consumption as a protective factor for
other gastrointestinal cancers (19–21). The goal of the current
investigation was to examine the association between coffee
intake and risk of colorectal cancer in a well-powered study with
comprehensive data on clinical characteristics, including anatom-
ic site, coffee preparation, and potential confounders.

 northern Israel (22). Subject recruitment began in 1998 and
remains ongoing. Individually matched controls with no personal
history of colorectal cancer are selected from the Clalit Health
Services database to ensure representation of the same source
population that gives rise to cases. Clalit Health Services is the
largest health care provider in Israel, covering more than 70% of
the study cases and providing a nationally standardized health
services basket. Matching factors include year of birth, sex, pri-
mary clinic location, and ethnicity (Jewish vs. non-Jewish). Sub-
jects are interviewed within 6 months of diagnosis to obtain
demographic data, clinical information, family history, and die-
tary habits. The present analysis included 5,145 cases and 4,097
controls with high-quality food frequency questionnaire data, for
a total of 9,242 MECC study participants (Table 1). Written
informed consent was obtained at the time of enrollment accord-
ing to Institutional Review Board-approved protocols at Carmel
Medical Center (Haifa) and the University of Southern California.
Assessment of coffee consumption
Coffee intake data were collected by in-person interview using a
validated,
semi-quantitative
food
frequency
questionnaire
adapted to the Israeli population. The questionnaire assessed the
frequency of consumption of decaffeinated coffee, boiled black
coffee, black coffee (espresso), instant coffee, and filter coffee 1
year prior to diagnosis for cases or interview for controls. The
questionnaire also assessed intake of tea and other beverages,
allowing for the calculation of total liquid consumption. To
assure high-quality data for analysis, 200 individuals with missing
or extreme values for energy consumption (total caloric intake
<600 or >4000) were excluded. Intake of each coffee type was
calculated by converting a semiquantitative scale into servings per
day, and total daily consumption was calculated by summing
servings per day of decaffeinated, boiled, espresso, instant, and
filter coffees. Further, 130 participants without complete data for
all five coffee types and 24 outliers with total coffee consumption
greater than four standard deviations from the mean were exclud-
ed. Finally, total coffee intake was converted into two derived
variables: (i) drinkers (>0 servings/day) and non-drinkers
(0 servings/day); and (ii) ordered categories of coffee drinking
informed by quartiles of consumption in controls. These four
categories consisted of <1 serving/day (reference category), �1
and <2 servings/day, �2 and �2.5 servings/day, and >2.5
servings/day.
Statistical analysis
The associations between total coffee consumption and estab-
lished colorectal cancer–associated risk and protective factors
were examined using c2 tests of independence and analysis of
variance. The association between coffee and colorectal cancer
was assessed using unconditional and conditional logistic regres-
sion, with adjustment for known colorectal cancer risk factors. The
inclusion criteria for covariates were study matching factors (for
unconditional analyses) and those with a statistically significant
association with colorectal cancer identified in prior published
analyses of the MECC data. The covariates included were age, sex,
ethnicity (Jewish vs. non-Jewish), family history of colorectal
cancer in a first-degree relative, vegetable consumption (�5 ser-
vings/day vs. <5 servings/day), sports participation (yes vs. no),
statin use (duration �5 years vs. <5 years), daily low-dose aspirin
use (duration �2 years vs. <2 years), and smoking status (current/
former/never). We conducted a test for trend based on an ordinal
score corresponding to the four categories of daily coffee con-
sumption described above. The associations were further explored
with stratification by ethnic subgroup (Ashkenazi Jews, Sephardi
Jews, and Arabs), cancer site (colon and rectum), and type of
coffee (decaffeinated, boiled, espresso, instant, and filtered).
Results
The demographic and clinical characteristics of the study
participants for analysis are summarized in Table 1. Findings
reported here are based on analyses of 5,145 cases and 4,097
controls (with 3,574 matched pairs for conditional logistic
regression). The majority of participants were of Ashkenazi
Jewish descent (61.3%), with individuals of Sephardi Jewish
(21.4%) and Arab (13.5%) descent comprising the other major
ethnic subgroups. As compared with controls, on average, cases
were slightly younger (matched for age within 1 year), were less
likely to take statins or low dose aspirin, were less likely to be
physically active, were less likely to consume 5 or more servings
of vegetables per day, were less likely to smoke, and had a
stronger family history of colorectal cancer. Overall, 74% of all
incident cases in the source population were identified and
approached, and 84% of these agreed to participate (case
participation rate, 62%). Among population-based controls,
the participation rate was 52%.

 The mean total coffee intake among controls was 2.0 servings
per day. Arabs had the highest total consumption with an average
of 3.3 servings per day, followed by Sephardi Jews with a mean
of 2.1 servings per day, and finally by Ashkenazi Jews with an
average of 1.8 servings per day. Total coffee consumption in the
complete sample, stratified by major ethnic group, can be visu-
alized in Fig. 1. Mean coffee consumption was statistically sig-
nificantly different across these 3 groups (P < 0.001). Instant
coffee was the most common type consumed by Ashkenazi and
Sephardi Jews, whereas boiled coffee was the most popular
among Arabs (Supplementary Fig. S1). Total coffee consumption
was associated with established colorectal cancer–associated fac-
tors: vegetable consumption (P < 0.001), daily low-dose aspirin
use (P ¼ 0.03), sports participation (P < 0.001), smoking status
(P < 0.001), and sex (P < 0.001).
Table 2 summarizes the unconditional logistic regression
results for coffee consumption and risk of cancer, comparing
coffee drinkers to non-drinkers. The results from matched anal-
yses of 3,574 pairs were not qualitatively different from those
conducted using an unconditional approach, so we present
unmatched analyses due to power considerations. Coffee con-
sumption was associated with a 26% reduction in the odds of
developing colorectal cancer after adjusting for study matching
factors and other known risk-associated factors [OR (drinkers of
any amount versus non-drinkers): 0.74; 95% confidence interval
(CI): 0.64–0.86; P < 0.001]. Additional adjustment for total daily
liquid consumption yielded a comparable overall colorectal
cancer adjusted OR (0.80; 95% CI, 0.68–0.93; P ¼ 0.005),
indicating that liquid intake did not account for the observed
association. Adjustment for total calorie consumption in addition
to matching factors and known risk factors also yielded a com-
parable OR (0.74; 95% CI, 0.63–0.86; P < 0.001). Upon strati-
fication by coffee type, an inverse association was maintained
for those consuming decaffeinated coffee (overall colorectal
cancer adjusted OR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.68–0.99; P ¼ 0.04) as well
as boiled coffee (overall colorectal cancer adjusted OR, 0.82;
95% CI, 0.71–0.94; P ¼ 0.004; Table 3).
Upon stratification by ethnic subgroup, the OR estimates for
Ashkenazi Jews, Sephardi Jews, and Arabs were consistent with the
total sample. Results were statistically significant for only Ashke-
nazi Jews and Sephardi Jews, the two largest ethnic subgroups
represented in the MECC study (Table 2). When considering
colon and rectal cancers separately, the OR estimates show an
inverse association between coffee consumption and risk of
cancer in either tumor location. The colon cancer estimates were
highly statistically significant in the total sample and in Sephardi
Jews. In the total MECC sample, the association for rectal cancer
was attenuated as compared with that for colon cancer but
reached statistical significance at the P < 0.05 level (OR, 0.78;
95% CI, 0.61–0.99; P ¼ 0.04). In addition, we did not observe
evidence of meaningful effect modification of the association
of coffee consumption and risk of colorectal cancer by other
covariates, including sex, vegetable consumption, physical
activity, statins, aspirin, smoking, or family history, with the
exception of age (ORinteraction ¼ 1.01; 95% CI, 1.00–1.03;
P ¼ 0.04).
Table 4 summarizes logistic regression results when consid-
ering daily total coffee intake in four categories. Compared with
drinkers of <1 serving/day, drinkers of 1 to <2 servings/day
(OR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.68–0.90; P < 0.001), 2 to 2.5 servings/day
(OR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.51–0.68; P < 0.001), and >2.5 servings/
day (OR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.39–0.54; P < 0.001) had statistically
significant lower odds of developing colorectal cancer in the
total MECC sample. Notably, we observed an inverse dose–
response relation between coffee intake and the odds of devel-
oping colorectal cancer (Ptrend < 0.001). When colon and rectal
cancers were examined individually, the direction and magni-
tude of ORs for all non-reference categories remained essen-
tially unchanged from colorectal cancer estimates and were
highly statistically significant. Table 4 also details the same set
of analyses stratified by ethnic subgroup. The statistically signif-
icant inverse dose–response relation between coffee and risk of
colorectal cancer, colon, or rectal cancers held in the two largest
ethnic subgroups (Ashkenazi and Sephardi Jews). Although pow-
er was limited for the analysis of Arab participants, consistent
directions of OR point estimates were observed.
Discussion
Here, we demonstrate that modest coffee consumption (�1
and <2 servings/day) is associated with a meaningful reduction in
the odds of developing colorectal cancer in a large, population-
based case–control study, and that the highest category of con-
sumption (>2.5 servings/day) is associated with a 54% reduction
in the odds of developing disease. The inverse association was
consistent for decaffeinated and boiled coffees, colon and rectal
cancers, and observed among all ethnic subgroups in our study.
Evidence of a dose–response relation with greater risk reduction
associated with increasing consumption supports the biologic
plausibility of these findings.
The results from this study support the growing body of
evidence suggesting coffee consumption as a protective factor for
colorectal cancer (11, 15, 23) and as a predictor of reduced
colorectal cancer recurrence and death (24). However, there are
differences in results and interpretations of case–control and
cohort studies (14, 18), possibly due to the different time period
of exposure considered relative to cancer diagnosis. A subgroup
analysis of cohort studies showed that studies with less than 10
years of follow-up were more likely to report an inverse associ-
ation between coffee consumption and risk of colorectal cancer
than those with follow-up longer than 10 years (15). With respect
to dose, our finding of a statistically significant inverse association

 was observed at lower levels of coffee intake than some previous
publications. For example, a recent dose–response analysis
observed a statistically significant inverse relation associated with
�4 cups/day (12), and another study in a Japanese population
showed a U-shaped relation between coffee and colorectal cancer
with decreased risk for up to 3 cups/day (25). In contrast to several
earlier reports observing no statistically significant association for
rectal cancer, our study demonstrated an inverse trend for both
colon and rectal cancers (11, 12, 14). This difference is possibly
due in part to a lack of power in prior studies.
A variety of potentially bioactive compounds in coffee could
independently or in combination exert chemopreventive prop-
erties, and thus, several mechanisms of action have been pro-
posed. Coffee constituents could influence colon health via roles
in motility and fecal output, microbiome composition, inflam-
mation, secretion of bile acids, insulin sensitivity, and the oxida-
tive environment of the colon (26). With respect to specific
components, chlorogenic acids are powerful antioxidants in vitro
and are believed to modify expression of genes encoding phase II
metabolism enzymes as well as to inhibit DNA methyltransferase
(27). Polyphenols are hypothesized to exert antioxidant and
antiproliferative effects as well as to induce cell-cycle arrest based
on experimental evidence in colorectal cancer cell lines (28). The
roasting products, melanoidins, may act in vivo as dietary fiber and
could increase colon motility (27). The diterpenes cafestol and
kahweol are plentiful in boiled and unfiltered coffees and may
exert anticarcinogenic activity by enhancing defense systems
against oxidative damage (7, 27, 29). Our finding of an inverse
association for boiled coffee provides epidemiologic evidence in
support of the protective role of these biochemical components.
Caffeine may have antioxidant capacity (27), and it may limit the
growth potential of human colon cancer cells (30). Our obser-
vation that an inverse association was present for decaffeinated
coffee alone indicates that caffeine is unlikely to be the sole
compound underlying coffee's protective properties.
Levels of exposure to these different compounds vary based on
the type of coffee bean, roasting degree, brewing technique, and
serving size. For example, cafestol and kahweol are removed by
filtration, and thus, filter and instant coffee contain very little
(4, 31). Further, more melanoidins are present in darker roasted
coffees and those with higher powder/water ratio during the
brewing process (26). Serving size has been shown to be the most
important factor for intake of chlorogenic acids and melanoidins
(3, 32). The lack of detailed information collected by most food
frequency questionnaires makes it difficult to discern in an
observational setting which coffee components are important.
Few population-scale studies have focused on dietary intake of
specific potentially bioactive components. However, one recent
Japanese study demonstrated a decreased risk of colorectal cancer
associated with coffee polyphenol intake (25). Relevant to our
study, it is possible that differences in the strength of association
between coffee consumption and colorectal cancer across ethnic
subgroups could be driven in part by the different distribution of
coffee types and serving sizes consumed.
Our study has several strengths as compared with prior inves-
tigations of the role of coffee-drinking and risk of developing
colorectal cancer. Two major benefits include exceptional power
to allow for stratified analyses and detailed questionnaire data to
enable the analysis of different coffee types. We also evaluated
caffeine status and indirectly investigated brewing methods of

 decoction (for boiled coffee) and gravitation (for filter coffee),
which most prior studies have not been able to accomplish.
Despite these strengths, our study was limited by a number of
factors. Unlike prospective cohort study designs, data were col-
lected for our case–control study at one point in time regarding
usual coffee consumption 1 year prior to diagnosis and, thus, we
could not assess duration of exposure. Further, no standardized
measurements for serving size were available. Limitations of the
observational nature of case–control designs, including the use of
food frequency recall, also need to be considered in the interpre-
tation of these results. Notably, we observed consistent results
upon stratification by stage at diagnosis, alleviating concerns that
recall bias may be more severe for patients with more advanced
disease. Alternative explanations for an inverse association
between coffee consumption and colorectal cancer include reverse
causation, with digestive tract disease and bowel symptoms
leading cases to avoid drinking coffee (14), and the possibility
that total fluid consumption or hot beverage drinking may reduce
risk of colorectal cancer through a mechanism of increased colon
motility. However, we observed that controlling for total beverage
consumption did not attenuate the inverse relation between
coffee and colorectal cancer. All case–control studies are poten-
tially vulnerable to residual confounding, including ours, and it is
possible that measured or unmeasured risk factors might lead to
biased estimates of the association between coffee consumption
and risk of colorectal cancer.
In conclusion, this large case–control study provides evidence
of an inverse, dose–response association between coffee drinking
and the odds of colorectal cancer, colon, and rectal cancer inci-
dence. It also suggests that caffeine is not the critical component
responsible for this inverse association and that the protective
association was not observed for filtered or instant coffees. The
health risks of coffee consumption are low, but additional evi-
dence is warranted before advocating for coffee consumption as a
nutraceutical approach to reduce the risk of colorectal cancer.
