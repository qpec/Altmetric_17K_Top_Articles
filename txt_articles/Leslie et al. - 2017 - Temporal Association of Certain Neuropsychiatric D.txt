Background: Although the association of the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine 
with autism spectrum disorder has been convincingly disproven, the onset of certain 
brain-related autoimmune and inflammatory disorders has been found to be temporally 
associated with the antecedent administration of various vaccines. This study examines 
whether antecedent vaccinations are associated with increased incidence of obsessive–
compulsive disorder (OCD), anorexia nervosa (AN), anxiety disorder, chronic tic disorder, 
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, major depressive disorder, and bipolar disorder in 
a national sample of privately insured children.
Methods: Using claims data, we compared the prior year’s occurrence of vaccinations 
in children and adolescents aged 6–15 years with the above neuropsychiatric disorders 
that were newly diagnosed between January 2002 and December 2007, as well as two 
control conditions, broken bones and open wounds. Subjects were matched with con-
trols according to age, gender, geographical area, and seasonality. Conditional logistic 
regression models were used to determine the association of prior vaccinations with 
each condition.
results: Subjects with newly diagnosed AN were more likely than controls to have 
had any vaccination in the previous 3 months [hazard ratio (HR) 1.80, 95% confidence 
interval 1.21–2.68]. Influenza vaccinations during the prior 3, 6, and 12 months were also 
associated with incident diagnoses of AN, OCD, and an anxiety disorder. Several other 
associations were also significant with HRs greater than 1.40 (hepatitis A with OCD and 
AN; hepatitis B with AN; and meningitis with AN and chronic tic disorder).
conclusion: This pilot epidemiologic analysis implies that the onset of some neuro-
psychiatric disorders may be temporally related to prior vaccinations in a subset of 
individuals. These findings warrant further investigation, but do not prove a causal role 
of antecedent infections or vaccinations in the pathoetiology of these conditions. Given 
the modest magnitude of these findings in contrast to the clear public health benefits of

There is a considerable body of scientific evidence indicating 
that the immune system plays a key role in normal brain devel-
opment and in the pathobiology of several neuropsychiatric 
disorders (1). These include obsessive–compulsive disorder 
(OCD) (2, 3), anorexia nervosa (AN) (4), tic disorders (5), 
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (6), major 
depressive disorder (7), and bipolar disorder (8). The precise 
role immune mechanisms play in these disorders remains to 
be determined.
In light of the role of the immune system in these central 
nervous system (CNS) conditions, the impact of vaccines 
on childhood-onset neuropsychiatric diseases had been 
considered and was mainly addressed with regards to the 
administration of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) 
vaccine (and its various components) and the subsequent 
development of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Although 
the controversy over MMR vaccination and ASD still exists 
for some members of the public, this association has been 
convincingly disproven (9, 10). On the other hand, the onset of 
a limited number of autoimmune and inflammatory disorders 
affecting the CNS has been found to be temporally associated 
with the antecedent administration of various vaccines (11). 
These disorders include idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, 
acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, and Guillain–Barré 
syndrome among others (12–16). More recently, data have 
emerged indicating an association between the administration 
of the H1N1 influenza vaccine containing the AS03 adjuvant 
and the subsequent new onset of narcolepsy in several northern 
European countries (17, 18). The immune mechanisms and host 
factors underlying these associations have not been identified 
or fully characterized, although preliminary data are beginning 
to emerge (18–23).
Given this growing body of evidence of immunological 
involvement in CNS conditions, and despite the controversy 
concerning the link between ASD and MMR and the clear public 
health importance of vaccinations, we hypothesized that some 
vaccines could have an impact in a subset of susceptible individu-
als and aimed to investigate whether there is a temporal associa-
tion between the antecedent administration of vaccines and the 
onset of several neuropsychiatric disorders, including OCD, AN, 
tic disorder, anxiety disorder, ADHD, major depressive disorder, 
and bipolar disorder using a case–control population-based pedi-
atric sample (children aged 6–15 years). To assess the specificity 
of any statistical associations, we also determined whether or 
not there were any temporal associations between antecedent 
vaccine administration and the occurrence of broken bones or 
open wounds.

Data were obtained from the MarketScan® Commercial Claims 
and Encounters database, which is constructed and maintained 
by Truven Health Analytics. Data from 2002 to 2007 were used 
for the study. MarketScan consists of de-identified reimbursed 
health-care claims for employees, retirees, and their dependents 
of over 250 medium and large employers and health plans. 
Hence, individuals included in the database are covered under 
private insurance plans; no Medicaid or Medicare data are 
included. The database includes claims information describing 
the health-care experiences for approximately 56 million covered 
lives per year. The database is divided into subsections, including 
inpatient claims, outpatient claims, outpatient prescription drug 
claims, and enrollment information. Claims data in each of the 
subsections contain a unique patient identifier and information 
on patient age, gender, geographic location (including state and 
three-digit zip code), and type of health plan.
The inpatient and outpatient services subsections of the 
MarketScan database contain information on all services per-
formed in an inpatient or outpatient setting. These data include 
information on dates of services, the diagnoses associated with 
the claim, and the procedures performed. The outpatient services 
subsection includes information for all services performed in 
a doctor’s office, hospital outpatient clinic, emergency room, 
or other outpatient facility. Previous studies have used the 
MarketScan database to examine health-care service use and 
costs for children (24–29).
study Population
The study sample consisted of children aged 6–15 with a diagnosis 
of one of the following conditions (ICD-9 codes in parentheses): 
OCD (300.3), AN (307.1), anxiety disorder (300.0–300.2), tic 
disorder (307.20 or 307.22), ADHD (314), major depression 
(296.2–296.3), and bipolar disorder (296.0–296.2, 296.4–296.8). 
To test the specificity of the models, we also included children with 
broken bones (800–829) and open wounds (870–897). To identify 
new cases, we further limited the sample in each diagnostic group 
to children who were continuously enrolled for at least 1 year 
prior to their first diagnosis for the condition (the index date). 
Next, a matched one-to-one control group was constructed for 
each diagnostic group consisting of children who did not have the 
condition of interest and were matched with their corresponding 
case on age, gender, date of the start of continuous enrollment, 
and three-digit zip code. Because vaccines tend to occur during 
certain times of year (such as before summer camps or the begin-
ning of school), controls were also required to have an outpatient 
visit at which they did not receive a vaccine within 15 days of 
the date that the corresponding case was first diagnosed with the 
the timely administration of vaccines in preventing mortality and morbidity in childhood 
infectious diseases, we encourage families to maintain vaccination schedules according 
to CDC guidelines.

condition, in an effort to control for seasonality. The date of this 
visit was the index date for children in the control group.
For each diagnostic group and their corresponding controls, 
individuals who were vaccinated in the 3, 6, or 12 months before 
the index date were identified. Exposure to vaccines was measured 
using CPT codes (list available from the authors upon request) 
and ICD-9 codes (V03–V06 or V07.2). Exposure to specific vac-
cines, including influenza, tetanus and diphtheria (TD), hepatitis 
A, hepatitis B, meningitis, and varicella, was tracked.
statistical analysis
The analyses were performed for each diagnostic group (and 
their controls) separately. Children with multiple conditions 
(e.g., ADHD and tic disorder) were included in each of the 
corresponding analytic groups. First, the proportion of children 
who were exposed to vaccines in the period before the index date 
was compared across the case and control groups. Next, bivariate 
conditional logistic regression models were estimated to deter-
mine the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% 
CIs) associated with the effect of vaccine exposure on having the 
condition of interest. Separate models were run for the 3-, 6-, and 
12-month periods preceding the index date for each diagnostic 
group. The study was approved by the Penn State College of 
Medicine Institutional Review Board.
resUlTs
Characteristics of each of the diagnostic groups are presented 
in Table 1. Sample sizes ranged from 551 children diagnosed 
with AN to 85,151 children with a broken bone. The average age 
ranged from 9.5 ± 2.5 for children with tic disorder to 13.3 ± 1.7 
for children with AN. Not surprisingly, the distribution of sex 
varied considerably across diagnostic groups, with higher per-
centages of females in the AN (86.6%) and major depression 
(56.3%) categories and higher proportions of males in the tic 
disorder (76.4%), ADHD (66.8%), open wound (62.2%), broken 
bone (58.4%), OCD (56.6%), and bipolar disorder (54.1%) 
categories.
Rates of receipt of vaccines in the 6 months before the first 
diagnosis of the disorder are also reported in Table 1 and varied 
considerably across diagnostic groups. Receipt of any vaccine in 
the previous 6 months was highest for children with AN (21.4%), 
followed by OCD (15.9%) and tic disorder (15.8%), and was 
lowest for children with open wounds (10.3%). Rates of receipt 
of specific vaccines were fairly low, ranging from 0.5% for the 
hepatitis vaccine among children with tic disorder to 8.4% for the 
influenza vaccine among children with tic disorder. In general, 
vaccination rates were highest among children in the AN, OCD, 
and tic disorder groups and were lowest for children in the open 
wound or bipolar disorder groups.
Table 2 presents HRs from the bivariate associations of receipt 
of vaccine within the 3-, 6-, and 12-month periods preceding the 
index date for each diagnostic group compared to their matched 
controls. Children with OCD, AN, anxiety disorder, or ADHD 
were more likely to have had a vaccination in each of the pre-
ceding periods than their matched controls, and children with 
tic disorder were more likely to have had a vaccination in the

preceding 6- and 12-month periods than their matched controls. 
HRs associated with receipt of any vaccine were highest for 
children with AN, ranging from 1.47 (95% CI 1.12–1.93) for the 
12-month preceding period to 1.80 (95% CI 1.21–2.68) for the 
3-month preceding period, followed by OCD, which ranged from 
1.23 for both the 12-month (95% CI 1.12–1.93) and 3-month 
(95% CI 1.02–1.49) preceding periods to 1.27 (95% CI 1.10–1.47) 
for the 6-month preceding period. However, children with bro-
ken bones were also more likely to have had a vaccination in the 
preceding period, although the HRs were smaller, ranging from 
1.04 (95% CI 1.00–1.08) for the 3-month preceding period to 1.08 
(95% CI 1.05–1.11) for the 6-month preceding period. The other 
control condition, open wounds, showed no increased incidence 
following vaccinations. In addition, children with major depres-
sion were less likely to have had a vaccination in all 3 preceding 
periods, and children with bipolar disorder were also less likely to 
have had a vaccination in the 6- or 12-month preceding periods.
There were fewer statistically significant results when looking 
at the effects of the individual vaccines. Children with OCD were 
more likely to have received the influenza vaccine in each of the 
preceding periods, or the hepatitis A vaccine in the previous 6 
or 12 months. Children with AN were also more likely to have 
received the influenza vaccine in the preceding 3 or 6 months, or 
the TD vaccine in the previous 12 months. Children with anxiety 
disorder were more likely to have received the influenza vaccine 
in the previous 12 months. Children with tic disorder were more 
likely to have received an influenza or a meningococcal vaccine 
in the previous 6 or 12 months. However, children with broken 
bones were also slightly more likely to have received the influenza 
vaccine during the previous 3-, 6-, and 12-month intervals. In 
contrast, children with major depression were less likely to have 
received the influenza vaccine in the previous 3 months or the 
meningitis vaccine in the previous 12 months. Similarly, children 
with bipolar disorder were also less likely to have received the 
influenza vaccine in the previous 3 or 6 months. Antecedent 
vaccination with any vaccine and with the TD vaccine during 
the previous 12 months was very modestly associated with a 
decreased incidence of open wounds (Table 2).
DiscUssiOn
The principal findings of this study are as follows: (i) children 
with OCD, AN, anxiety disorder, and tic disorder were more 
likely to have received influenza vaccine during the preceding 
1-year period (for OCD in the preceding 3-, 6-, and 12-month 
periods; for AN in the preceding 3- and 6-month periods; for 
anxiety disorder in the preceding 6- and 12-month periods; for tic 
disorder in the preceding 6- and 12-month periods) and (ii) HRs 
associated with receipt of any vaccine were highest for children 
with AN, ranging from 1.47 for the 12-month preceding period to 
1.80 for the 3-month preceding period, followed by OCD, which 
ranged from 1.23 for both the 12- and 3-month preceding periods 
to 1.27 for the 6-month preceding period. However, if we apply 
a high standard [so that the upper limit of the of the 95% CI of 
the HR observed for the association between the administration 
of any vaccine and the subsequent occurrence of a broken bone 
(1.11) falls below the lower limit of the 95% CI observed for any 
of the HRs for any of the neuropsychiatric disorders], only the 
findings for AN pass this stringent threshold (Table 2). Applying 
a similar high standard for the individual vaccines, the only asso-
ciations that pass this threshold concern the influenza vaccine 
given in the preceding 6- and 12-month periods for OCD and 
anxiety disorders.
Our findings showing that children with AN, OCD, or a tic 
disorder were more likely to have received the influenza vaccine 
in the preceding periods were noteworthy given the findings of 
increased incidence of narcolepsy in Finland, Sweden, Ireland, 
Norway, England, and France after vaccination with AS03-
adjuvanted H1N1 vaccine (17, 18). Studies also show a threefold 
increase in the incidence of narcolepsy after following the 2009 
H1N1 pandemic in China (30). Although the strong association 
between HLA class II and narcolepsy suggests that narcolepsy 
may be an autoimmune disorder, the exact mechanism leading 
to immune-related narcolepsy is not completely understood and 
other host factors are likely to play an important role (31, 32). 
Investigators have made use of in silico techniques to begin to 
identify potential causal pathways and the relevant host factors 
(19). More recently, Ahmed et al. (23) have shown that the H1N1 
influenza vaccine containing the AS03 adjuvant triggers antibod-
ies that bind to hypocretin receptor 2a. Additional work is needed 
to replicate and extend these findings.
It is also of note that the observed association between the 
antecedent administration of the influenza vaccine and the new 
onset of AN and OCD may suggest that aberrant immune func-
tioning may be a common pathogenetic pathway for OCD and 
AN. The high comorbidity rates between OCD and AN, common 
cortico-striatal abnormalities in neuroimaging studies, and anti-
putamen antibodies both in OCD and AN cases are some of the 
shared features of these two disorders worth considering (33–35). 
In addition, the increased risk for autoimmune disorders (such 
as type 1 diabetes mellitus, Crohn’s disease, and celiac disease) in 
eating disorders (36) and the documented comorbidity of OCD 
and autoimmune diseases (such as systemic lupus erythematosus, 
thyroid dysfunction, and multiple sclerosis) (35) indicate the 
possible shared host factors and the role of immune-mediated 
mechanisms in the development of AN and OCD. We also 
note the findings of Zastrow and colleagues that vaccination to 
prevent H1N1 influenza is recommendable even in extremely 
underweight AN patients (37).
Limitations of this study include that we were unable to 
control for the fact that providers may designate ICD-9 insur-
ance billing codes for vaccines generally without specifying the 
particular vaccine. Additionally, we were unable to match claims 
by providers in order to control for the diagnostic predilections 
of individual physicians and account for the possibility that 
some physicians might be more (or less) likely to diagnose one 
or more neuropsychiatric disorders and/or recommend specific 
vaccinations. The results of this study are further qualified by 
the limitations of the administrative retrospective data used in 
this study, rather than from systematically obtained clinical data, 
especially around diagnostic classification. This is a shortcom-
ing inherent in studies that rely on secondary analyses to secure 
large sample sizes. Furthermore, early vaccines are grouped 
together in the first 15 months of infancy, some of them given

simultaneously at one visit and received by most of the infants. 
This leads to a limitation in analyzing the possibility of the 
temporal association between individual vaccines and the onset 
of neuropsychiatric disorders. We deliberately chose our sample 
from children aged 6–15 years in order to overcome this limita-
tion. Another limitation concerns changes in vaccine guidelines 
during the time interval used in this analysis. For example, the 
American Academy of Pediatrics first recommended the use of 
the conjugate meningococcal vaccine in August 2005 and the 
varicella booster in April 2007. As a consequence, the size of the 
cohorts who received these vaccines is smaller in comparison to 
other vaccines. Another issue concerns the fact that the influenza 
vaccination is an annual vaccination using a vaccine specific for 
a given year to protect against the highly variable influenza virus. 
As a consequence, it is also the most frequently administered 
vaccine that indeed may well have disproportionately “driven” 
the “any vaccine” findings (Table 1). Given its variability and 
prevalence, in future studies, it will be important to look year-
by-year. Perhaps the largest limitation and potential threat to 
the study’s validity has to do with the fundamental impossibility 
of detecting a causal relationship within the context of such a 
case–control study. Indeed, this provides no more than a relative 
perspective of the potential risk, as opposed to the absolute risk 
(the real proportion of individuals who had a vaccination and 
then developed one or more of the investigated conditions) that 
might be expected to be reasonably small.
Moving forward, our findings require replication in a larger 
population-based sample, possibly including assessments of 
various potentially important host factors, e.g., the individual’s 
genomic and epigenomic background, the individual’s micro-
biome, their history of antecedent psychosocial stress, infec-
tions, as well as other potentially simultaneously administered 
vaccinations, the differences in vaccine types, and the route of 
administration (e.g., intramuscular or intranasal administration 
of influenza vaccine) as different routes of administration may 
lead to a difference in immune responses in the host.
It will also be critically important to determine whether or 
not newly acquired infectious diseases against which the children 
were vaccinated may themselves lead to an increased incidence 
to one or more of these neuropsychiatric disorders. In fact, it 
would not be surprising if the diseases per se represent a stronger 
risk factor than vaccinations. The documented increase in the 
incidence of narcolepsy following the 2009 H1N1 pandemic in 
China provides a clear example (30). Our earlier epidemiological 
study documenting a temporally related modest increase in the 
incidence of OCD, tic disorders, and ADHD following a prior 
streptococcal infection provides another example (25). Future 
epidemiologic investigations are needed to address this impor-
tant question.
The present study has the potential to extend our knowledge 
about the role of the immune system in some pediatric-onset 
neuropsychiatric disorders. However, our findings do not 
demonstrate a causal role of vaccination in the pathoetiology of 
any of these conditions. This is especially important given the 
clear public health benefits of the timely administration of vac-
cines in preventing mortality and morbidity (38). Vaccines are 
among the most successful and cost-effective preventive public 
health interventions (39). Vaccination has led to eradication of 
smallpox, and we are close to the eradication of poliomyelitis 
across the world. Since most of the vaccine-preventable diseases 
are contagious from person to person, the increase in numbers 
of vaccinated individuals will decrease the chance of a disease 
to spread. Proper vaccination not only protects our generation 
but also protects future generations against epidemics of diseases. 
It should always be kept in mind that vaccines are crucial for 
eradicating infectious diseases and preventing the higher rates of 
morbidity and mortality due to infections. However, care should 
be taken to ensure that children scheduled to receive vaccinations 
are in good health and that recommended precautions are taken 
at the time a vaccine is to be administered.
clinical significance
These findings provide preliminary epidemiologic evidence that 
the onset of some pediatric-onset neuropsychiatric disorders, 
including AN, OCD, anxiety disorders, and tic disorders, may 
be temporally related to prior vaccinations. Each of these condi-
tions is etiologically heterogeneous, and host factors likely play 
an important role in a small subset of vulnerable individuals. 
However, these findings, even if replicated in future studies, do 
not prove a causal role of vaccination in the pathoetiology of 
any of these conditions. Indeed, antecedent infections may also 
increase the risk of developing one or more of these disorders in 
vulnerable individuals. Finally, given the modest magnitude of 
these findings and the clear public health benefits of the timely 
administration of vaccines in preventing mortality and morbidity 
in childhood, we encourage families to maintain the currently 
recommended vaccination schedules while taking all necessary 
precautions as documented by the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention (http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/recs/vac-admin/
contraindications.htm).
