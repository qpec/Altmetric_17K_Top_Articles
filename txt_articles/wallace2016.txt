OBJECTIVE: To compare complications and outcomes
after hysterectomy for benign compared with malignant
indications in the United States.
METHODS: Women who underwent hysterectomy in
the United States for either benign or malignant indica-
tions from January 2008 to December 2012 were retro-
spectively identified using the National Surgical Quality
Improvement Program database. Patients were excluded
if the procedure was not performed for primary gyne-
cologic indications. Appropriate procedures were iden-
tified
using
Current
Procedural
Terminology
and
International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision
codes. Univariate and multivariable models for compli-
cation risk were estimated using logistic regression.
RESULTS: We identified 59,525 eligible patients, with
49,331 (82.9%) hysterectomies performed for benign and
10,194 (17.1%) for malignant indications. All complica-
tions, including wound complications (2.5% benign
compared with 5.5% malignant, P,
.001), venous throm-
boembolism (0.33% compared with 1.7%, P,
.001), uri-
nary tract infection (2.7% compared with 3.2%, P5
.009),
sepsis (0.53% compared with 1.9%, P,
.001), blood trans-
fusion (2.6% compared with 11.5%, P,
.001), death
(0.02% compared with 0.10%, P,
.001), unplanned read-
mission (1.8% compared with 4.5%, P,
.001), and returns
to the operating room (0.91% compared with 1.4%,
P,
.001), were significantly more common for malignant
hysterectomies. The overall rate of complications for
benign cases was 7.9% compared with a rate of 19.4%
for malignant hysterectomy. The median operating time
for laparoscopy in benign cases was significantly longer
than for open or vaginal hysterectomy procedures
(127 minutes compared with 105 or 94 minutes, respec-
tively; P,
.001). The median operating time in malignant
cases was significantly longer than for benign cases
(P,
.001).
CONCLUSION: Hysterectomies performed for gyneco-
logic malignancies are associated with a more than
twofold higher complication rate compared with those
performed for benign conditions. Minimally invasive
surgery is associated with a decreased complication rate
compared with open surgery. These data can be used for
patient counseling and surgical planning, determining
physician and hospital costs of care, and considered
when assigning value-based reimbursement.

ysterectomy is one of the most common surgical
procedures performed annually in the United
States, and the rate of inpatient hysterectomy has
declined recently to approximately 400,000.1–4 The
procedure has recently garnered attention regarding
the use of laparoscopic and robotic techniques and
power morcellation.5,6 Owing to diverse indications
for hysterectomy, there are significant differences in
resource utilization and complications. Knowledge of
these outcomes is necessary for counseling, bench-
marking, and cost analysis.
Hysterectomy is commonly performed for benign
indications such as leiomyomas or gynecologic malig-
nancy.7,8 Trends in hysterectomy reflect an emphasis
on minimally invasive surgery with anticipated shifts
away from inpatient abdominal hysterectomy.2,9,10
Considering these profound practice changes and
diverse indications for hysterectomy, specific data

 regarding outcomes would be valuable. Although
differences in complication rate and outcomes are
expected when comparing benign and malignant
hysterectomy, no large database studies have specif-
ically defined this difference. Additionally, it is
imperative for hospitals to compare system-based
trends in morbidity and mortality to improve care.
The National Surgical Quality Improvement Program
database was established by the American College of
Surgeons.11,12 This program prospectively collects
data to allow risk adjustment and 30-day follow-up
from more than 500 participating hospitals. The
National Surgical Quality Improvement Program al-
lows evaluation on a national basis to identify oppor-
tunities to identify risk factors and improve outcomes.
We sought to better understand the complexities of
hysterectomy by defining and comparing national
complication rates after hysterectomy for benign with
malignant indications.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The National Surgical Quality Improvement Program
database was used to retrospectively identify patients
who underwent hysterectomy from January 2008 to
December 2012. Current Procedural Terminology
(CPT) codes were used to separate hysterectomy from
other surgical procedures. International Classification
of Diseases, 9th Revision codes were used to deter-
mine the indication for hysterectomy and to differen-
tiate between benign (218, 291, 617, 618, 621, 625–
627) and malignant (180–184, 158.0, 158.8, 158.9,
179, 197.6, 198.6, 198.82, 199.0, 199.1, 236.0, 236.2,
236.3) procedures. Using CPT codes, hysterectomy
procedures were further divided into laparotomy

and
minimally
invasive
surgery
(58260, 58262, 58263, 58367, 58270, 58275, 58280,
58285, 58548, 58550, 58552, 58553, 58554, 58570,
58571, 58572, 58573, 58290, 58291, 58292, 58293,
58294, 58541, 58542, 58543, 58544). Patients were
excluded if the procedure was not performed for
gynecologic indications or if sex was not specified as
female. Patients undergoing pelvic exenteration for
gynecologic malignancy were also excluded, because
the extent and complexity of the surgery would not be
easily comparable with other types of hysterectomies.
The primary endpoint was to determine complication
rates of benign compared with malignant hysterec-
tomy. The secondary endpoint included determining
risk factors for complications.
The National Surgical Quality Improvement Pro-
gram prospectively collects data, including patient
risk factors, to allow accurate risk adjustment and 30-
day postoperative follow-up from more than 500
participating hospitals nationally. The results are
reported to each institution as observed-to-expected
performance in comparison with other hospitals.11
Complications and patient variables were defined
and abstracted according to National Surgical Quality
Improvement Program methodology.11
Patient demographics and preoperative, intra-
operative,
and
postoperative
characteristics
were
summarized by standard summary statistics such as
the mean (standard deviation) for continuous varia-
bles and frequencies (%) for categorical variables.
Complication rates were computed at the patient level
such that multiple complications reported for a patient
were treated as a single event. Rates stratified by
benign compared with malignant diagnoses or hys-
terectomy type were computed by complication type
and compared by x2 testing. Exact tests and Monte
Carlo estimates for the exact test were used to com-
pute P values when event rates were observed to be
low. Operating times were summarized by percentiles
and compared between diagnosis and procedure
groups through Kruskal-Wallis tests. Logistic re-
gression models were estimated to examine the asso-
ciation
among
patient,
intra-
and
postoperative

 characteristics, and the probability of any complica-
tion. Unplanned readmission and return to the oper-
ating room were only available for 2011–2012 and
therefore were not included as events for the regres-
sion models. Odds ratios (ORs) based on univariate
and multivariable models (adjusted for indication, pri-
mary procedure performed, age, race, body mass
index (BMI, calculated as weight (kg)/[height (m)]2),
American Society of Anesthesiologists class, concur-
rent procedures, preoperative transfusion, and preop-
erative hematocrit levels) were presented for each
factor of interest along with 95% confidence intervals.
Two-sided P values were generated by x2 tests and
values ,.05 were considered statistically significant.
All analyses were performed using SAS/STAT 12.1.
Institutional review board exemption was obtained
from Winthrop University Hospital to perform this
study, because the existing deidentified data in the
National Surgical Quality Improvement Program
database are publicly available.
RESULTS
Data from the National Surgical Quality Improvement
Program database were collected from 211 hospitals in
2008, 237 in 2009, 258 in 2010, 315 in 2011, and 374
hospitals in 2012. During this time period, the National
Surgical Quality Improvement Program collected data
on 1,957,023 cases of which 66,876 (3.4%) were coded

 as hysterectomies. One hundred fifty-eight cases were
excluded as a result of ineligible CPT codes, 7,031
were excluded as a result of ineligible International
Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision codes, and 162
were excluded for missing sex or having sex listed as
male. Therefore, a total of 59,525 hysterectomies met
inclusion criteria for final analysis with 49,331 (87.2%)
performed for benign and 10,194 (17.1%) for malig-
nant indications (Fig. 1).
Patients who had hysterectomies for malignant
indications were more likely to be older (mean age
60.8 compared with 47.5 years for benign indica-
tions), white non-Hispanic race (72.5% compared with
61%), and obese (52.3% BMI 30 or greater compared
with 42.3%, respectively). These patients were also
more likely to have hypertension (49.7% compared
with 25.9%), diabetes (16.8% compared with 6.6%),
American Society of Anesthesiologists class 3 or
greater (48.1% compared with 16.4%), and longer
hospital stays (33.4% compared with 5.3% greater
than 4 days) (Table 1). These findings are not novel
and confirm the higher acuity of the patient popula-
tion undergoing surgery for malignancy.
Minimally invasive surgery was used for the
majority of hysterectomies (66.2%); however, the rate
was higher in benign cases (70.5%). This coincides
with the known trend regarding minimally invasive
hysterectomy approaches and the declining rate of
inpatient
hysterectomy.2
In
contrast,
an
open
approach was used more often for malignant hyster-
ectomies (54.7%).
Complications, as defined by National Surgical
Quality Improvement Program, were evaluated sep-
arately for benign and malignant hysterectomy.11

 to the operating room were collected and compared.
The most common complication for benign hysterec-
tomies was urinary tract infection. The most common
complication in malignant cases was the need for in-
traoperative or postoperative blood transfusion within
72 hours of the procedure. The overall rate of
complications for benign hysterectomy was 7.9%
compared with a rate of 19.4% for malignant hyster-
ectomy (Table 2).
Laparotomy performed for any indication was
associated with greater rates of complications. In the
benign group, total abdominal hysterectomy had the
greatest rate of any complication (12.1%) and laparo-
scopic supracervical hysterectomy had the lowest rate
(4.8%) (Table 3). In the malignant group, abdominal
supracervical
hysterectomy
had
the
highest
rate
(34.8%) and total laparoscopic hysterectomy had the
lowest (7.2%) (Table 4).
For benign cases, median operating room time,
which reflects surgical start to end (incision to
closure), but does not account for patient positioning
and draping, was longer for laparoscopic cases
(127.0 minutes) when compared with open cases
(105.0 minutes; P,.001). Vaginal hysterectomy had
the shortest operating time at 94.0 minutes. For malig-
nant cases with a diagnosis of uterine or cervical
malignancy, laparoscopy also had longer median
operating room times (172.0 and 209.5 minutes,
respectively; P,.001) compared with laparotomy
(143.0 and 177.0 minutes, respectively). For ovarian
cancer cases, laparoscopy and open cases had similar
operating times (174.5 and 173.0 minutes, respec-
tively; P5.09) (Table 4). The median operating time
in malignant cases was significantly longer than for
benign cases (P,.001).
Univariate and multivariable analyses were per-
formed. Multivariable analysis identified that smoking
(OR 1.12 [1.04–1.22]), partially dependent functional
status (OR 1.51 [1.15–1.98]), all races except white or
Caucasian (black or African American OR 1.10 [1.01–
1.2], Asian OR 1.37 [1.17–1.60], other OR 1.28 [1.01–
1.63], unknown OR 1.20 [1.09–1.33]), American Soci-
ety of Anesthesiologists class 3–5 (OR 1.55 [1.45–
1.66]), and being underweight (OR 1.37 [1.05–1.80])
remained significantly independently associated with
risk of complication. Hysterectomies performed for
malignancy and having disseminated cancer also sig-
nificantly increased the risk of complication (OR 2.07
[1.92–2.22] and OR 2.38 [2.03–2.80], respectively).
These findings are representative of a patient popula-
tion with increased medical complexity, leading to
increased postoperative complication rates. Perioper-
ative factors such as concurrent procedures (OR 1.28
[1.21–1.36]), operating room time greater than 2–3
hours (OR 1.44 [1.27–1.64], 3–4 hours OR 2.11
[1.84–2.41], 4–5 hours OR 2.89 [2.48–3.37], greater
than 5 hours OR 4.20 [3.57–4.95]), preoperative
blood transfusion (OR 2.46 [1.97–3.06]), and uterine
weight greater than 250 g (OR 1.15 [1.02–1.30])
increased the risk of complication, showing that pro-
longed operating time, often as a result of increased
surgical complexity, leads to more complications. His-
panic ethnicity, any race (OR 0.87 [0.79–0.96]), high-
er preoperative albumin (OR 0.64 [0.58–0.70]), higher
preoperative hematocrit (OR 0.92 [0.92–0.93]), and
all procedures other than total abdominal hysterec-
tomy (supracervical hysterectomy OR 0.36 [0.32–
0.41], vaginal hysterectomy OR 0.82 [0.72–0.94], total
laparoscopic hysterectomy OR 0.40 [0.37–0.43], lap-
aroscopic supracervical hysterectomy OR 0.54 [0.49–
0.59]) were related to decreased complication rates
(Tables 5 and 6).
DISCUSSION
This study reveals the complication rate after hyster-
ectomy is more than twofold higher when performed
for malignant compared with benign conditions.
Additionally, median operating time was significantly
longer for laparoscopic cases and malignant cases.
These
findings
suggest
an
association
relating
increased complexity of patients with malignancy
and additional skill required for laparoscopic proce-
dures. Prior studies show the benefit of minimally
invasive surgery in decreasing complication rates,
realizing the increased cost associated with some
techniques such as robotic surgery.13–15 Little has been
written directly comparing benign and malignant hys-
terectomy using a nationwide database.
The 2011–2012 National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey showed that 65.8% of women
older than age 20 years are overweight or obese.16
However, 73.1% and 75.9% of women undergoing
benign or malignant hysterectomy, respectively, are
overweight or obese (Table 1). The overrepresenta-
tion of obese women in this cohort likely represents
obesity-driven estrogen-dependent pathology, includ-
ing leiomyomas, abnormal uterine bleeding, and
endometrial cancer.17–19 Infection risk increases with
elevated BMI, and a higher rate of overall complica-
tions has been reported in ovarian cancer debulking
surgery.20,21
Surgical approach to hysterectomy is an impor-
tant consideration during preoperative assessment
and surgical planning. Consistent with prior studies,
the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program
data demonstrate that minimally invasive surgery is

 associated with lower rates of wound complications,
venous thromboembolism, and urinary tract infec-
tion.15,22 Open procedures were associated with a high-
er risk of complications in both benign and malignant
cases (Tables 3 and 4). Laparoscopy is known to
require longer surgical times,22,23 which is confirmed

 by our data. The tradeoff for longer times, and poten-
tially higher intraoperative costs, is justified by lower
complication rates. Given that laparotomy is com-
monly
performed
for
malignant
conditions,
the
increased rate of complications for the open approach
is anticipated. However, the rate of minimally inva-
sive surgery in malignant patients in this study was
substantial (45.3%).
Preoperative variables play a role in surgical
planning and outcomes.20,21,24,25 This study shows Asian
women were more likely to experience complications,
which is consistent with previous research. This could
be partially explained by prior studies showing Asian
women may be more likely to have endometriosis and
less likely to undergo laparoscopic hysterectomy.26–28

Guidelines
for
hysterectomy
approach
exist,
understanding
that
this
decision
is
complex.1,3
Recently, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is-
sued an updated recommendation against the use of
power morcellation for hysterectomy for uterine leio-
myomata.29 Harris et al6 showed a decline in laparo-
scopic hysterectomy rate of 4.1% and a significant
increase in postoperative blood transfusion and read-
mission following the U.S. Food and Drug Adminis-
tration warning. These findings emphasize the need
for
continued
discussion
regarding
hysterectomy
method to ensure sustained patient safety.
Reimbursement of surgical procedures is a fre-
quently discussed and debated topic. In 2012, the
relative value unit, a measure of perioperative effort
determining reimbursement, was 17.31 for total abdom-
inal hysterectomy (CPT code 58150), 15.88 for total
laparoscopic hysterectomy for a uterus less than 250 g
(CPT code 58570), and 14.15 for vaginal hysterectomy
for a uterus less than 250 g (CPT code 58260). As of
2015, relative value units were reduced for laparoscopic
hysterectomies. Justification for these changes included
reduced physician involvement during postsurgical care.
However, the increased time and effort during surgery
were not recognized nor was the overall lower compli-
cation rate rewarded. Consequently, surgeons will be
reimbursed less for minimally invasive surgery despite
longer operating room times24 (Table 7).
Strengths of this study include use of the National
Surgical Quality Improvement Program database to
obtain national, validated data. As a result of multiple
data points, multivariate analysis was used to control
for confounding factors. Weaknesses of retrospective
studies apply. Additionally, the data are limited to the
hospitals participating in the database. Although
a random sample, this may not represent all practices.
The database cannot account for factors that deter-
mine the selection of hysterectomy approach.11
This study provides rates of complications after
hysterectomy
based
on
prospectively
collected,
national data. This information is useful for surgical
planning and counseling, equipping physicians and
patients with current information regarding operating
times and complication rates related to patient and
perioperative characteristics. The data also serve as
reference for public health decision-making such as
the morcellation debate and projecting health care
costs. Our comprehensive data give evidence regard-
ing distinct variables suggesting increased complexity
and complications, which provides objectivity to
public health discussions. In addition, this study
should be considered for determining models for
value-based reimbursement, which includes patient
complexity and effort involved in perioperative care.
