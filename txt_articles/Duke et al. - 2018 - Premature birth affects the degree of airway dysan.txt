New Findings
r What is the central question of this study?
Adult survivors of preterm birth without (PRE) and with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD)
have airflow obstruction at rest and significant mechanical ventilatory constraints during
exercise compared with those born at full term (CON). Do PRE/BPD have smaller airways,
indexed via the dysanapsis ratio, than CON?
r What is the main finding and its importance?
The dysanapsis ratio was significantly smaller in BPD and PRE compared with CON, with
BPD having the smallest dysanapsis ratio. These data suggest that airflow obstruction in PRE
and BPD might be because of smaller airways than CON.
Adult survivors of very preterm birth (�32 weeks gestational age) without (PRE) and with
bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) have obstructive lung disease as evidenced by reduced
expiratoryairflowatrestandhavesignificantmechanicalventilatoryconstraintsduringexercise.
Airflow obstruction, in any conditions, could be attributable to several factors, including small
airways. PRE and/or BPD could have smaller airways than their counterparts born at full term
(CON) owing to a greater degree of dysanaptic airway development during the pre- and/or
postnatal period. Thus, the purpose of the present study was to compare the dysanapsis ratio
(DR), as an index of airway size, between PRE, BPD and CON. To do so, we calculated DR in PRE
(n = 21), BPD (n = 14) and CON (n = 34) individuals and examined flow–volume loops at rest
and during submaximal exercise. The DR, using multiple estimates of static recoil pressure, was
significantly smaller in PRE and BPD (0.16 ± 0.05 and 0.10 ± 0.03 a.u.) compared with CON
(0.22 ± 0.04 a.u.; both P < 0.001) and smallest in BPD (P < 0.001). The DR was significantly
correlated with peak expiratory airflow at rest (r = 0.42; P < 0.001) and the extent of expiratory
flow limitation during exercise (r = 0.60; P < 0.001). Our findings suggest that PRE/BPD might
have anatomically smaller airways than CON, which might help to explain their lower expiratory
airflow rate at rest and during exercise and further our understanding of the consequences of
preterm birth and neonatal O2 therapy.

Introduction
Human birth occurring at or before 32 weeks of gestation
results in cardiopulmonary detriments as a result of
underdeveloped lungs (Slavin et al. 1985; Hislop &
Haworth,1990;Margrafetal.1991;Parker&Abman,2003;
Th´
ebaud & Abman, 2007). The functional consequences
of these detriments are, at present, incompletely known,
but recent investigations have uncovered both unexpected
and expected outcomes. Unexpectedly, pulmonary gas
exchange efficiency at rest and during exercise is well
within the normal expected values (Lovering et al. 2013;
Duke et al. 2014a; Farrell et al. 2015; Goss et al.
2015). Expectedly, significantly reductions in pulmonary
function (Narang et al. 2009; Lovering et al. 2013, 2014;
Duke et al. 2014a) and aerobic exercise capacity have been
reported compared with those born at full term (Vrijlandt
et al. 2006; Narang et al. 2009; Lovering et al. 2013,
2014; Clemm et al. 2014; Duke et al. 2014a). Specifically,
adult survivors of very preterm birth without (PRE) and
with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) have significant
mechanical ventilatory constraints, i.e. expiratory flow
limitation (EFL) and a reduction in inspiratory reserve
volume to �0.5 l during exercise (Lovering et al.
2014), which is suggested to result in excessive dyspnoea
(Guenette et al. 2012). However, PRE and BPD have
these mechanical ventilatory constraints in the absence
of dynamic hyperinflation and at a lower ventilation than
CON (Lovering et al. 2014). The presence of mechanical
ventilatory constraints in PRE and BPD during exercise
is unsurprising given the degree of airflow obstruction
observed at rest in these individuals, but occurs in the
presence of normal lung volumes (Narang et al. 2009;
Lovering et al. 2013, 2014). However, the underying
cause of airflow obstruction is unknown and has not
been investigated. Understanding how the determinants
of expiratory airflow differ in PRE and BPD compared
with their age-, sex- and height-matched counterparts
born at full term (i.e. control subjects; CON) is important
clinically (Bolton et al. 2015) and physiologically, as it may
elucidate the cause of the lower aerobic exercise capacity
in PRE and/or BPD.
Expiratory airflow is determined by a number of
parameters, as described by Poiseuille’s equation (Hogg
et al. 2017). These parameters include the pressure drop
along the tube (airway) and resistance to flow through
it. Resistance to airflow has the largest effect on airflow
rate and is primarily influenced by airway diameter.
It is known that airways and lung volume/size grow
simultaneously, although not necessarily proportionally,
which is referred to as lung ‘dysanapsis’. Dysanapsis
describes the very loose coupling between airway size
and lung volume (Green et al. 1974), and the extent of
dysanapsis present can be quantified non-invasively with
the dysanpasis ratio [DR; Eqn (1)] and used as an index
of airway size, although it does not provide an anatomical
measurement (Green et al. 1974; Mead, 1980; Dominelli
et al. 2011, 2015; Smith et al. 2014). The DR, calculated
in this manner, has been used to distinguish airway and
airflow characteristics between males and females (Smith
et al. 2014; Dominelli et al. 2015) and between individuals
with and without EFL (Dominelli et al. 2011; Smith et al.
2014). Calculation of DR requires the measurement of
static recoil pressure at 50% of forced vital capacity [FVC;
Pst(l)50], which has been estimated using Eqn (2) (see
Methods section ‘Dysanapsis ratio’) obtained from data
in healthy individuals (Turner et al. 1968), i.e. T-Pst(l)50.
The estimation of Pst(l)50 is itself a limitation, but the
equation derived from the data of Turner et al. (1968)
may not be appropriate for PRE and/or BPD individuals
given that they have obstructive lung disease of an
aetiology not related to smoking, etc. Histological data
from animal models of BPD, a condition that develops
from prolonged neonatal O2 therapy and results in
cardiopulmonary sequelae in addition to those resulting
from only preterm birth, have demonstrated the presence
of alveolar simplification (Tomashefski et al. 1984; Le
Cras et al. 2000, 2002; Th´
ebaud et al. 2005). Additionally,
Margraf et al. (1991) reported a lower number of alveoli in
infants who perished from severe BPD and suggested that
this could negatively affect expiratory airflow. Alveolar
simplificationwouldbelikelytodecreasePst(l)toadegree,
perhaps, similar to mild emphysema, but Pst(l) has yet to
be measured directly in PRE or BPD. Silvers et al. (1980)
have reported Pst(l) data in excised healthy lungs and
lungs of patients with mild emphysema. These data allow
us to estimate Pst(l)50 [Eqns (3) and (4), i.e. S-Pst(l)50]
and then calculate DR [Eqn (1)] using data that may better
represent the lung disease associated with preterm birth.
Both PRE and BPD have abnormal lung function at
birth, but have development that is parallel to their CON
counterparts, i.e. have a similar magnitude of change
in FVC and forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1;
Vollsæter et al. 2013). However, they do not appear
to ‘catch up’ to CON (i.e. their lung function remains
lower in early adulthood). Accordingly, they may have
excessive dysanaptic lung growth, which can be shown by
calculating the DR. Having a smaller DR would result in
greater expiratory airflow resistance and, thus, decreased
expiratory airflow. Additionally, a small DR could, in
part, explain the excessive EFL present in PRE and BPD
individuals. Obtaining a more complete understanding
of the physiology and pathophysiology of the obstructive
lung disease resulting from preterm birth and BPD
might provide evidence on which medical management
of PRE/BPD can be based, because this does not exist at
present (Bolton et al. 2015). Therefore, the purpose of
the present investigation was to determine whether there
was an effect of gestational age on DR and whether there
was a relationship between DR and various parameters

Premature birth and airway dysanapsis
associated with expiratory airflow, in an effort to explain
the causes of airflow obstruction at rest and mechanical
ventilatory constraints during exercise in PRE and BPD.
Methods
Ethical approval
All subjects (see next subsection) volunteered to parti-
cipate in the study after being advised both verbally and
in writing as to the nature of the experiments. Informed
consent was obtained both orally and in writing. The
study protocols were approved by both the University
of Oregon Office of Responsible Conduct of Research
(approval #02032011.021) and the Ohio University Office
of Research Compliance (approval #15F021). All studies
were performed in accordance with the standards set
forth by the Declaration of Helsinki except for registration
in a database. The studies began at the University of
Oregon (2009–2014) and concluded at Ohio University
(2014–2016). Although data collection took place at two
sites, measurements were obtained with identical equip-
ment and methods in both locations, as described below.
Subjects
The work presented below is a retrospective analysis
of previously collected anthropometric, lung function
and volume data, some of which has been published
(Lovering et al. 2013, 2014; Duke et al. 2014a; Laurie
et al. 2017), but data on additional subjects (n = 21)
were collect specifically for these analyses. The primary
outcome variable, DR, has not been previously published
or discussed. A total of 166 non-smoking individuals aged
18–32 years volunteered for the study. Of the n = 166
individuals, n = 97 did not qualify or were excluded for
a variety of reasons, e.g. inadequate pulmonary function
(control only; see below), presence of a patent foramen
ovale for examination of pulmonary gas exchange
efficiency (control only; Lovering et al. 2013; Duke
et al. 2014a) or inability to perform a forced expiratory
manoeuvre adequately. In total, data from n = 69
individuals were included in the present study, and n = 14
(n = 6 female) were born at least very premature (i.e. born
at or before 32 completed weeks of gestation) without
BPD, n = 21 (n = 10 female) were born at least very
premature with BPD, and n = 34 (n = 15 female) were
born at full term (CON). A priori power analysis using
our previously collected data and data from Dominelli
et al. (2011) suggested that our sample size was more than
sufficient to detect a significant difference in DR should
one exist. Diagnosis and classification of very preterm
birth with and without BPD was determined by a board
certified neonatologist (I.M.G.) using medical records
and the criteria outlined in the NICHD/NHLBI/ORD
workshop summary (Jobe & Bancalari, 2001), which
has been validated (Ehrenkranz et al. 2005). Using these
guidelines, all subjects with BPD were classified as having
‘new BPD’ with a range of severities including mild
(n = 7), moderate (n = 12) or severe (n = 2) BPD
based on these criteria (Jobe & Bancalari, 2001). As has
been previously done (Clemm et al. 2012; MacLean et al.
2016), adult survivors of preterm birth without and
with mild BPD were combined to form the ‘PRE’ group,
and adult survivors of preterm birth with moderate or
severe BPD were combined to form the ‘BPD’ group. The
rationale for this is that pulmonary function is similar
between no/mild BPD individuals and moderate/severe
BPD individuals, but different from each other, i.e.
individuals with moderate or severe BPD have pulmonary
function that is statistically significantly worse than that
in individuals with mild BPD. Individuals included in the
study as a member of the CON group were required to be
matched to a member of the PRE or BPD group by sex,
age (±3 years), height (±5 cm) and mass (±5 kg), as well
as to attain an FEV1 and FVC �90% predicted.

Resting pulmonary function and lung diffusing capacity.
Baseline pulmonary function was determined using
computerized spirometry (Ultima PFX; MedGraphics, St
Paul, MN, USA) according to standards set forth by
the American Thoracic/European Respiratory Societies
(Miller et al. 2005). Lung volumes and capacities
were determined using whole-body plethysmography
(Elite Series Plethysmograph; MedGraphics) according to
societal standards (Wanger et al. 2005). Lung diffusing
capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) was determined
usingthesingle-breath,breath-holdtechnique(MacIntyre
et al. 2005). Predicted values for pulmonary function and
capacities were obtained using the appropriate predictive
equations (Hankinson et al. 1999; Gutierrez et al. 2004;
Quanjer et al. 2012). The values reported are the average of
the three manoeuvres used to obtain societal repeatability
standards.
Dysanapsis ratio. We determined DR using the methods
originally described by Green et al. (1974) and Mead
(1980) and used more recently (Dominelli et al. 2011,
2015; Smith et al. 2014) as a ratio of measurements
sensitive to lung size and airways size. In the present study,
we used FVC as a measure of lung size. We determine the
index of airways size, i.e. DR [Eqn (1)], using the forced
expiratory airflow rate at 50% of FVC (FEF50), FVC and
estimated Pst(l)50, which was done using Eqn (2) (Turner
et al. 1968), i.e. T-Pst(l)50, as has been done previously
(Dominelli et al. 2011, 2015; Smith et al. 2014). Turner
et al. (1968) measured Pst(l)50 in healthy individuals, so
it may not be appropriate to use these data to estimate
Pst(l)50 in PRE or BPD. Silvers et al. (1980) measured

Pst(l)50 in excised healthy lungs and excised lungs from
patients with mild emphysema. Based upon the discussion
above, PRE and BPD might have obstructive lung disease
mechanicallysimilartomildemphysema.Therefore,using
data from Silvers et al. (1980), we developed Eqns (3) (for
CON) and (4) (for PRE and BPD) to estimate S-Pst(l)50.
Then, DR was calculated using Eqn (1) as described above.
The FVC and FEF50 values used were averages from the
three manoeuvres used to meet societal standards. In those
subjects who required more than three manoeuvres to
reach societal repeatability criteria, we used the average
of only the three values used to attain repeatability. The
DR calculated using predicted T-Pst(l)50, via Eqn (2), has
recently been shown not to differ from the DR calculated
using Pst(l)50 measured by oesophageal pressure in healthy
adult males and females (Dominelli et al. 2015).

Peak oxygen consumption ( ˙
VO2peak) testing. Metabolic
rate was determined at rest and during exercise using
a metabolic cart (Ultima PFX; MedGraphics). Subjects
performed a progressive exercise test to volitional
exhaustion on an electronically braked cycle ergometer
(Excalibur Sport; Lode, Gronigen, The Netherlands) while
breathing room air to determine ˙
VO2peak and peak power
output (in watts). Subjects breathed room air through
a low-resistance two-way non-rebreathing valve (2400
series; Hans Rudolph, Shawnee, KS, USA) for all exercise
in visits 2 and 3.
Heart rate and peripheral estimate of O2 saturation (SpO2).
Peripheral estimate SpO2 was measured continuously
during the incremental exercise test using a Nellcor
Oximax N-600 pulse oximeter (Covidien, Minneapolis,
MN, USA) with a forehead sensor (Oximax Max-Fast).
These data were exported into the same data acquisition
software (Breeze v.6.3, MedGraphics Diagnostics, St. Paul,
MN, USA) that collected breath-by-breath metabolic data.
Heart rate was obtained continuously and simultaneously
via the pulse oximeter and also exported to Breeze.

rested
for
10–15 min on the bicycle and then exercised for 4 min
each at 25, 50, 75 and 90% of the peak power output
attained in visit 2 with a 10 min break between each bout.
Exercise bouts occurred in increasing intensity from 25
to 90% of peak power output. Metabolic and ventilatory
data were measured continuously throughout exercise
using a metabolic system as has been previously done
in our laboratory (Lovering et al. 2013, 2014; Duke et al.
2014a). Heart rate and SpO2 were measured continuously
during submaximal exercise as described in the previous
subsection.

manoeuvres were conducted before any exercise according
to ATS/ERS standards (Miller et al. 2005). The largest
pre-exercise FVC was used as the maximal flow–volume
loop as has been done previously (Johnson et al.
1992, 1999; Lovering et al. 2014; Tanner et al. 2014;
Duke et al. 2014b; Weavil et al. 2015). At rest and
3 min into each exercise stage, tidal flow–volume loops
(5–10 breaths) were recorded using commercial software
(Breeze;MedGraphicsDiagnostics)aswehavedonebefore
(Lovering et al. 2014). To do so, subjects were asked
to perform an inspiratory capacity (IC) manoeuvre and
then resume normal ventilation. Initially, several breaths
following the IC manoeuvre were discarded to ensure
that lung volumes were not influenced by the altered
breathing pattern immediately after the manoeuvre. Then,
the subsequent 5–10 breaths were used for analysis. All
subjects were instructed on how to perform the IC
manoeuvre, and the subjects were allowed to practise
this manoeuvre several times before exercise testing. No
subject had difficulty performing the IC reliably, and
it has been previously demonstrated that even subjects
with respiratory muscle weakness and severe chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease can reliably perform an
IC manoeuvre even during exercise (Stubbing et al. 1980;
Yan et al. 1997; O’Donnell et al. 1998). The ICs were used
to align 5–10 exercise flow–volume loops relative to total
lungcapacity(TLC)withintheinitialFVCloopperformed
at the beginning of the study visit (Johnson et al. 1999).
Lung volumes, i.e. end-expiratory and end-inspiratory
lung volumes (EELV and EILV, respectively) were then
calculated by subtracting IC from FVC to determine EELV
(EELV = TLC − IC) and adding tidal volume (VT) to
EELV to determine EILV (EILV = EELV + VT), as we have
previously done (Lovering et al. 2014; Duke et al. 2014b;
Weavil et al. 2015). The extent of EFL was determined
based on the percentage of the VT that met or exceeded
the maximal flow–volume loop, determined/calculated by
Breeze. The %EFL for each subject was determined by
averaging the %EFL from all representative breaths used
for lung volume analyses that were recorded. The effects
of thoracic gas compression and/or exercise-induced
bronchodilatationonthemaximalflow–volumeloopwere
not considered in this study (see Discussion ‘Limitations’).

Premature birth and airway dysanapsis
The VT and respiratory rate (RR) from these breaths were
used to calculate minute ventilation ( ˙
VE).
Data analysis
All statistical analyses were performed using Prism
statistical sofware (v7.0a; GraphPad Software, Inc., San
Diego, CA, USA), and α was set to equal P = 0.05 a
priori. Anthropometrics, aerobic exercise capacity/peak
power output, pulmonary function and DR data were
compared between CON, PRE and BPD using multiple
one-way ANOVAs, with Tukey’s HSD post hoc test when
appropriate.Multipletwo-wayANOVAs(group×exercise

variables [ ˙

differences between groups and exercise intensities. To
determine the association between DR and dynamic
(EFL) and static (peak flow at rest) measures of airflow
obstruction,Pearsoncorrelationcoefficients(r)wereused.
Results
Birth and prematurity
The PRE individuals were born at 28.0 ± 2.0 weeks
gestational age (range 25–32 weeks) and weighed
1.06 ± 0.32 kg (range 0.65–1.76 kg). The BPD individuals
were born at 27.6 ± 2.1 weeks gestational age (range
24.5–31 weeks) and weighed 1.04 ± 0.24 kg (range
0.74–1.42 kg).
Anthropometrics, pulmonary function, lung diffusive
capacity and ˙
VO2peak
Anthropometrics, exercise capacity data and resting
spirometry are presented in Table 1. By design there
were no differences in anthropometrics between groups.
PRE had significantly lower
˙
VO2peak than CON, but
there were no differences between BPD and CON or
BPD and PRE. PRE and BPD had peak power output
that was lower than CON, but not different from one
another. There were no differences between groups in the
absolute value of slow vital capacity or FVC. BPD attained
a significantly lower percentage of predicted slow vital
capacity and FVC compared with CON but not PRE, and
there was no difference between PRE and CON in either
parameter. CON had a significantly greater absolute value
and percentage of predicted value for FEV1, FEV1/FVC
ratio and forced expiratory flow throughout the FVC
compared with PRE and BPD. BPD individuals had a
significantly smaller absolute value for FEV1, FEV1/FVC
and forced expiratory flow throughout the FVC (50
and 75% only) compared with PRE. Additionally, BPD
attained a significantly lower percentage of predicted
value for FEV1, FEV1/FVC and forced expiratory flow
throughout the FVC (peak, 25, 50 and 75%) compared
withPRE.PlethysmographyandDLCO valuesaredisplayed
in Table 2. There were no differences between groups
in absolute values or percentage of predicted for lung
volumes except for BPD having a smaller inspiratory
capacity than CON. PRE and BPD had significantly lower
absolute and percentage of predicted values for DLCO, but
not different from one another.
Dysanapsis ratio
The DR data, calculated via Eqn (1), are displayed in Fig. 1.
The DR data calculated using T-Pst(l)50 are displayed
in Fig. 1A, and DR data calculated using S-Pst(l)50 are
displayed in Fig. 1B. The DR, regardless of estimated
Pst(l)50 used, was significantly smaller in PRE and BPD
compared with CON, with BPD having a significantly
smaller DR than PRE (P < 0.0001 for all). Post hoc power
analysis revealed that we attained a power of >0.99 for
the data in Fig. 1A. The T-Pst(l)50 did not differ between
groups, but S-Pst(l)50 was significantly less in PRE and
BPD compared with CON (P < 0.0001 for both), but not
different from one another. The FVC was not different
between groups, thus the smaller DR in PRE and BPD
is, at least in part, attributable to the lower FEF50 and/or
Pst(l)50 compared with CON.
Our goal in matching CON to PRE or BPD based
upon sex, age, height and mass was to match them
on FVC, because absolute lung volume has an effect
on DR. Table 1 shows that CON, PRE and BPD were
reasonably well matched for FVC, but not perfectly. To
ensure that the significantly smaller DR in PRE and
BPD was not attributable to the slightly smaller FVC,
we shuffled our subjects to try and attain groupings that
were better matched for FVC (± 0.1 l). Fortunately, we
have a relatively large sample size and were able to do
this successfully in two ways. First, we matched PRE or
BPD individuals to a member of the CON group using a
single CON only once. This matching resulted in n = 12
PRE–CON pairs (FVC = 4.9 ± 1.2 and 4.9 ± 1.2 l for
PRE and CON, respectively) and n = 9 BPD–CON pairs
(FVC = 5.0 ± 1.0 and 5.0 ± 1.0 l for BPD and CON,
respectively). Then, we computed unpaired Student’s
t tests between the pairs on DR calculated with S-Pst(l)50.
PRE and BPD had significantly smaller DR compared with
their respective CON groups (P < 0.01 for both). These
data are displayed in Fig. 1C. Although not reported, DR
calculated using S-Pst(l)50 was also significantly smaller
in PRE and BPD compared with their respective CON
groups. Second, using a slightly more liberal FVC range
(± 0.2 l) we matched n = 9, i.e. 27 total subjects, triplets
of subjects (BPD–PRE–CON) who were well matched for
FVC (4.8 ± 1.2, 4.8 ± 1.1 and 4.8 ± 1.2 l for BPD, PRE
and CON, respectively). Then, we analysed the DR data

there were no differences between PRE and BPD. The ˙
VO2
and carbon dioxide output were significantly greater in
CON compared with PRE and BPD during exercise at 75
and 90% of peak power output, but not at lower exercise
intensities. There were no systematic differences between
groups in ˙
VE, VT, RR or EELV and EILV. The EFL was
significantly greater than pre-exercise during exercise at
50% (BPD only), 75% (PRE and BPD only) and 90% of
peak power (all groups). BPD had a significantly greater
%EFL than PRE and CON during exercise at 50, 75 and
90% of peak power output. PRE had a significantly greater
%EFL than CON during exercise at 75 and 90% of peak
power output. Those individuals with a %EFL of >20%
were considered to be flow limited. At rest, no CON, no
PRE and one BPD was flow limited. During exercise at
90% of peak power output, 14 out of 34 CON individuals
were flow limited, and 12 out of 21 PRE and 14 out of 14
BPD individuals were flow limited.
Relationship between DR and parameters
of expiratory airflow
Figure 2A displays DR versus peak expiratory flow rate
(PEF), and Fig. 2B shows %EFL during exercise at 90%
of peak power output. In both Fig. 2A and B, the dashed
line represents the least-squares line of best for the data.
Bothrelationshipsarestatisticallysignificant(P<0.0001),
with the strength of the relationships between DR and
PEF (r = 0.42) and between DR and %EFL (r = −0.61)
being considered ‘strong’ (Keppel, 1973). Some subjects
did not have %EFL of >0% during exercise at 90% of peak
power output, so those subjects (n = 14 CON and n = 6
PRE) were removed from the correlation analysis because
a significant number of zeros would artificially anchor the
correlation and inflate the strength of the relationship.
Out of interest, we computed the correlation with all of
the zeros included, and the strength of the relationship
was not meaningfully different (r = −0.61 versus −0.64
with zeros excluded and included, respectively).
Discussion
The purpose of the present study was to quantify the
DR in adult survivors of preterm birth with and without
BPD and compare that with a group of age-, sex-,
height- and weight-matched individuals born at full term.
Additionally, we aimed to determine whether DR was
associated with various parameters of resting and exercise
expiratory airflow. Doing so would help to determine
whether a smaller DR explained, in part, the lower than
normal expiratory airflow rates at rest and the presence
of EFL during exercise in PRE and BPD individuals.
The main findings of the present study are that DR was
significantly lower in PRE and BPD compared with CON,
with BPD having a significantly smaller DR than PRE.
An important feature of the present study is that we
calculated DR with two estimations of Pst(l)50 [T-Pst(l)50
and S-Pst(l)50]. Doing so allows us to conform to previous
work using the DR (Dominelli et al. 2011, 2015; Smith
et al. 2014) and to account for the mild emphysema-like
effect of alveolar simplification suggested to occur in
PRE and BPD. Regardless of the Pst(l)50 equation used,
DR was significantly smaller in PRE and BPD compared

with CON and in BPD compared with PRE. Finally, our
intent in matching CON to PRE and BPD individuals
was to match for FVC, but our pairing was imperfect
(�0.3–0.4 l different). Owing to the effect a smaller FVC
would have on the DR calculation, we re-matched a subset
of our subjects in multiple ways so that FVC was <0.1 or
<0.2 l different between pairs or triplets, respectively, to
minimize or completely abolish the possible confounding
effect a smaller FVC would have on the differences in
DR we found between CON and our preterm groups
(Fig. 1). Taking this series of analyses together, there is
a strong rationale to conclude that gestational age and
neonatal O2 therapy significantly affect DR, implying that
PRE and BPD may have smaller airways than CON, with
BPD possibly having the smallest airways. This confirms
our hypothesis and contributes significantly to the field by
suggesting that PRE and BPD have anatomically smaller
airways than CON, which will provide a foundation for
future intervention work to be developed and carried out.
Additionally, DR was significantly correlated with PEF at
rest and %EFL during exercise.
PRE and BPD are known to have significantly lower
expiratory airflow rates at rest (Narang et al. 2009;
Lovering et al. 2013, 2014; Duke et al. 2014a) and
significant mechanical ventilatory constraints during
exercise (Lovering et al. 2014), but the underlying cause
has not been examined. Poiseuille’s equation describes the
determinants of expiratory airflow and provides us with
several parameters to examine to identify why PRE and/or
BPDhaveexpiratoryairflowobstructionatrestandduring
exercise. Specifically, the pressure reduction along the
airway and airflow resistance, which is primarily affected
by airway diameter, might be affected by premature birth
and neonatal O2 therapy, which are the foci of the present
study.
Airway diameter is a difficult parameter to measure
non-invasively and can be affected by both anatomical and
physiological factors. PRE and BPD have underdeveloped
lungs at birth (Margraf et al. 1991; Baraldi & Filippone,
2007; Th´
ebaud & Abman, 2007) and despite, presumably,
normal postnatal lung development, have lower lung
function in adulthood compared with their counterparts
born at full term. Specifically, PRE and BPD, when
appropriately height matched to a CON individual, have
approximately the same size lungs (i.e. FVC and TLC) but
have significantly lower expiratory airflow rates. Thus, it is
areasonablehypothesisthatthereducedexpiratoryairflow
rates observed in PRE and BPD are the result of smaller
airways. Airway diameter can be indexed non-invasively
using the DR. Previous work has shown the DR to be
a valuable tool to describe the airway resistive aspect
of respiratory mechanics (Dominelli et al. 2015), but
it is not without its limitations (Babb et al. 2012; see
‘Limitations’sectionbelow).Nevertheless,theDRhasbeen
used to demonstrate a sex effect on airway size, which
is associated with a greater resistive work of breathing
in females (Dominelli et al. 2015), and to distinguish
between those with and without EFL (Dominelli et al.
2011; Smith et al. 2014). Although DR is an estimate of
global ‘airway size’, it is important to point out that the
non-invasively calculated DR has been shown to be in
good agreement with computed tomography imaging of
the airways of older adults (Sheel et al. 2009). Additionally,
our findings of a smaller DR, i.e. smaller airways, in PRE
and BPD are in agreement with high-resolution computed
tomography findings in adults with BPD showing a
reduced bronchus-to-pulmonary artery diameter ratio
(Howling et al. 2000), which is suggestive of smaller
airways.
The present study is the first to report DR in PRE and
BPD, but using mean values from Vrijlandt et al. (2006)
who studied adult survivors of preterm (26–36 weeks
gestation) birth one can calculate DR to be �0.16, which is
a similar magnitude to what we report here (Fig. 1). In the
present study, DR, i.e. ‘airway size’, is 55 ± 15% smaller in
BPD compared with their matched CON individuals and
25 ± 20% smaller in PRE compared with their matched
CON individuals. Assuming that the lower DR is the
direct consequence of underdevelopment, the magnitude
of difference we observed between PRE/BPD and CON
is reasonable given the magnitude of difference in other
pulmonary function parameters pertaining to expiratory
airflow (i.e. FEV1, PEF, FEF25–75, etc.). Additionally, we
found significant correlations between DR and PEF and
DR and %EFL (all groups combined), implying that a low
DR plays an important role in airflow obstruction. Given
thatPREandBPDhavethelowestairflowsandthesmallest
DR values, but normal lung volumes, the data suggest that
small airways might account for a significant proportion
of the airflow obstruction in PRE.
An alternative conclusion could be that rather than PRE
and BPD having anatomically smaller airways, reflected by
a smaller DR, bronchoconstriction and/or excessive/early
dynamic airway compression are the cause of the lower
FEF50 and thus DR. Bronchoconstriction could occur
in PRE and/or BPD because of asthma, although the
incidence of asthma in PRE and BPD does not appear to
be greater than it is in the general population (Bacharier,
2014). Additionally, it is possible that injury to the
airway resulting from O2 therapy and/or mechanical
ventilationduringtheneonatalperiodcouldleadtoairway
hyperresponsiveness (Reyburn et al. 2012). Regardless,
PRE and BPD adults, on average, do not appear to have
significant reversibility in airflow obstruction (Filippone
et al. 2003; Fawke et al. 2010; Lovering et al. 2013), nor
do children (Vollsæter et al. 2015). Although these data
do not rule out the possibility that some PRE and/or BPD
have asthma/bronchoconstriction, they do suggest that
this is not the sole cause of the smaller DR we observed in
the present study. Nevertheless, future work focusing on

Premature birth and airway dysanapsis
airway responsiveness in PRE and BPD would be valuable
to physiologists and clinicians.
Dynamic airway compression occurs when pressure
outside of the airway exceeds pressure inside of the airway,
causing airway ‘collapse’, which effectively decreases the
airway diameter and increases airflow resistance towards
infinity. Excessive dynamic airway compression could
occur in PRE and/or BPD if they were able to generate
a very large, positive intrapleural pressure or if their
airways had less cartilaginous support (via parenchymal
changes and airway tethering) and were ‘floppy’ and
easily compressible. Emphysema would make airways
more ‘floppy’ and is known to occur in ‘old BPD’
(Northway & Rosan, 1967; Wong et al. 2008) and may
occur in ‘new BPD’, although more work is needed. Mahut
et al. (2007) reported abnormal computed tomography
findings in infants. The ‘abnormal’ findings reported were
consistent with impaired alveolarization, which might
have an emphysema-like effect as has been previously
discussed, but were not severe enough to be considered
emphysematous. Aukland et al. (2009) reported similar
findings with regard to decreased alveolarization using
high-resolution computed tomography in adults with
BPD. More recent work suggests that emphysema occurs
in ‘new BPD’, but probably to only a very minimal extent
(Simpson et al. 2017), which makes this an unlikely cause
of the smaller DR observed in PRE and/or BPD in the
present study. Perhaps the most important conclusion
to be drawn from the existing pulmonary imaging data,
which parallels the pulmonary function data, in PRE and
BPD individuals is the extreme heterogeneity in pathology
that exists in these individuals. Studies conducted on large
cohorts are needed to identify and describe the ‘typical’
structural changes in the lungs of PRE and BPD adults.
Finally, the pressure drop along the airway, i.e. the
driving pressure, could explain, in part, the lower
expiratory airflow rates in PRE and BPD. Expiratory
driving pressure changes as a function of expiratory
effort such that it is minimal during passive breathing
at rest and maximal during a forced expiration. In PRE
and BPD, alveolar pressure, and thus driving pressure,
could be reduced if they had respiratory muscle weakness,
reduced static recoil pressure and/or small intra- or
extrathoracic airways (Melissinos & Mead, 1977; Quanjer
et al. 1997). Expiratory muscle strength could be assessed
with maximal expiratory pressure manoeuvres, but there
are insufficient data in PRE and BPD to draw a meaningful
conclusion. Nevertheless, the available data in children
with, presumably ‘old BPD’ (Jacob et al. 1998) suggest no
effect of gestational age on maximal expiratory pressure.
An indirect way to assess respiratory muscle strength
could be to examine peak expiratory airflow rate (PEF),
which is determined by expiratory muscle strength and
intra- and extrathoracic airway diameter concurrently.
The present study and others (Northway et al. 1990;
Halvorsen et al. 2004; Vrijlandt et al. 2006) have reported
a significantly lower PEF in PRE and BPD compared
with CON individuals. Making the assumption that a
normal PEF reflects a normal pressure-generating ability,
it is reasonable to suggest that the increased airflow
obstruction observed in PRE and BPD is likely to be
attributable greater airflow resistance. We did not measure
Pst(l)50 directly in the present study, but given the existing
histological data in animals (Tomashefski et al. 1984; Le
Cras et al. 2000, 2002; Th´
ebaud et al. 2005), as well as
the computed tomography data in humans (Margraf et al.
1991; Mahut et al. 2007; Wong et al. 2008; Aukland et al.
2009) it is possible that alveolar simplification and/or
emphysema may reduce Pst(l)50 and contribute to the
reduced expiratory airflow rates. This is and will remain
speculative until that study is conducted. Data from the
present study suggest that high airflow resistance in PRE
andBPDmightbeattributabletosmallerairways,reflected
by a smaller DR. Importantly, a ‘normal’ driving pressure
through an airway with a smaller radius will result in a
lower airflow rate because of the greater resistance.
Limitations
The primary limitation associated with the DR is that
it provides only an index of airway size and does not
provide us with a direct anatomical measurement nor
does it provide us with information about where in the
tracheobronchial tree the differences in airway size occur
(Sheel et al. 2015). However, the present study shows
that forced expiratory airflow rates are similarly reduced
throughout the FVC. Importantly, the DR has been shown
to correlate well with airway measurements made with
high-resolution computed tomography in older adults
(Sheel et al. 2009). Determining the DR requires the
estimation or measurement of Pst(l)50, with the former
perhaps resulting in an inaccurate reflection of the true
dysanapsis in an individual (Babb et al. 2012). Recent
work compared the measured and estimated Pst(l)50 in
healthy individuals and found no difference (Dominelli
et al. 2015), which provides some support for the use of
predicted Pst(l)50 in the present study. Another potential
limitationisthatthepredictionequationforT-Pst(l)50 was
developed using healthy individuals (Turner et al. 1968),
and we are applying it to individuals with obstructive
lung disease, which might impact the accuracy of our
DR calculation. To address this, we have also estimated
S-Pst(l)50 using excised lung data from healthy individuals
and individuals with mild emphysema (Silvers et al. 1980).
Estimating S-Pst(l)50 using these data resulted in PRE and
BPD having a significantly smaller estimated static recoil
pressure than CON. However, the calculated DR using
S-Pst(l)50 was still significantly smaller in PRE and BPD
compared with CON and smaller in BPD compared with
PRE. Despite having obstructive lung disease, our PRE

and BPD cohort (Lovering et al. 2013, 2014; Duke et al.
2014a) and the cohort of others (Vrijlandt et al. 2006;
Welsh et al. 2010; Clemm et al. 2014) are considered
to be of normal physical fitness, i.e. ‘healthy’, based
upon their measured ˙
VO2peak values. This is in contrast
to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients, who
have a ˙
VO2peak of <20 ml kg min−1 and peak power of
<100 W (Chin et al. 2013). Although PRE and BPD are
often considered to be comparable to chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease patients (Baraldi & Filippone, 2007),
the existing data do not support this conclusion (Lovering
et al. 2013; Duke et al. 2014a; Farrell et al. 2015). Finally,
we have correlated PEF at rest and %EFL during exercise
with DR. These relationships support the hypothesis that
airway diameter, regardless of group, has an impact on
expiratory airflow. However, because of the parameters
used to calculate DR the strength of these relationships
might be artificially high. Nevertheless, these correlations
merely suggest that DR is physiologically meaningful in
PRE and BPD.
An additional limitation associated with this study is
related to the magnitude of %EFL. We did not correct our
maximal flow–volume loop for thoracic gas compression
or exercise-induced bronchodilatation. Thus, it is likely
that our %EFL are overestimated by, perhaps, as much
as 50% (Guenette et al. 2010), i.e. PRE and BPD have
�50% of VT that is flow limited, but it might be �25%
of VT. Although these factors would have affected all
individuals, regardless of group, the extent of thoracic gas
compression and/or exercise-induced bronchodilatation
is variable between individuals, so it would not be possible
to estimate how this would impact the relationship
between DR and %EFL beyond altering the magnitude
of %EFL in all subjects by 50%, which would have
no effect on the strength of the relationship. Future
work should quantify the magnitude of thoracic gas
compression and exercise-induced bronchodilatation in
PRE and BPD individuals, as this could provide some
intriguing information about whether or not they have
the typical or expected airway response to exercise.
Summary and conclusions
The purpose of this study was to quantify and compare
the DR, an index or airway size, between adult survivors
of preterm birth with and without BPD and their age-,
sex-, height- and weight-matched counterparts born at
full term. The main finding of the present study is that PRE
and BPD have a significantly smaller DR than CON, and
BPD have a significantly smaller DR compared with PRE.
This persists with multiple estimates of Pst(l)50 and with
multiple subject matchings for FVC, providing strength to
our conclusions. Additionally, DR was significantly related
to measures of expiratory airflow obstruction at rest and
during exercise. Taken together, the data in the present
study suggest that smaller than normal airways explain,
at least in part, the lower expiratory airflow rate in PRE
andBPD.Thepresentfindingsaddimportantinformation
to our understanding of the cardiopulmonary physiology
of PRE and BPD. Likewise, this work may suggest that
existing therapies to treat airflow obstruction may not
have the expected effect, because the airways of PRE
and/or BPD are likely to be anatomically small rather than
constricted.
