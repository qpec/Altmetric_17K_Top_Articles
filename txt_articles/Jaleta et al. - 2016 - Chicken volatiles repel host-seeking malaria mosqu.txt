malaria mosquitoes

Abstract 
Background: Anopheles arabiensis is a dominant vector of malaria in sub-Saharan Africa, which feeds indoors and 
outdoors on human and other vertebrate hosts, making it a difficult species to control with existing control meth-
ods. Novel methods that reduce human-vector interactions are, therefore, required to improve the impact of vector 
control programmes. Investigating the mechanisms underlying the host discrimination process in An. arabiensis could 
provide valuable knowledge leading to the development of novel control technologies. In this study, a host census 
and blood meal analysis were conducted to determine the host selection behaviour of An. arabiensis. Since mosqui-
toes select and discriminate among hosts primarily using olfaction, the volatile headspace of the preferred non-
human host and non-host species, were collected. Using combined gas chromatography and electroantennographic 
detection analysis followed by combined gas chromatography and mass spectrometry, the bioactive compounds in 
the headspace collections were identified. The efficiency of the identified non-host compounds to repel host-seeking 
malaria mosquitoes was tested under field conditions.
Results: The host census and blood meal analyses demonstrated that An. arabiensis strongly prefers human blood 
when host seeking indoors, while it randomly feeds on cattle, goats and sheep when found outdoors. However, An. 
arabiensis avoids chickens despite their relatively high abundance, indicating that chickens are a non-host species for 
this vector. Eleven bioactive compounds were found in the headspace of the non-host species. Six of these were spe-
cies-specific, out of which four were identified using combined gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. When 
tested in the field, the chicken-specific compounds, isobutyl butyrate, naphthalene, hexadecane and trans-limonene 
oxide, and the generic host compounds, limonene, cis-limonene oxide and β-myrcene, significantly reduced trap 
catches within the house compared to a negative control. A significant reduction in trap catch was also observed 
when suspending a caged chicken next to the trap.
Conclusions: Non-host volatiles repel host-seeking An. arabiensis and thus play a significant role in host discrimina-
tion. As such, this study demonstrates that non-host volatiles can provide protection to humans at risk of mosquito-
vectored diseases in combination with established control programmes.

Background
Despite recent global intervention efforts, malaria 
remains a major public health problem in sub-Saharan 
Africa [1–4]. The widespread use of indoor residual 
spraying (IRS) and insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs) 
has led to a significant reduction in the main vector of 
malaria, Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto, throughout 
much of sub-Saharan Africa [5, 6]. However, the inte-
grated IRS/ITN strategy has inadvertently led to a pro-
portional shift to outdoor residual malaria transmission 
by sympatric species, in particular Anopheles arabiensis, 
which is now a dominant malaria vector in the region [7–
10]. As An. arabiensis is an opportunistic feeder on both 
human and other vertebrate hosts [11–14], its ability

to feed indoors and outdoors on available hosts, makes 
this mosquito a vector that requires a more coordinated 
control strategy [7, 13, 14]. After the introduction and 
continued use of IRS and ITNs, Anopheles mosquito 
populations have been reported to change from feeding 
indoors to feeding outdoors [6, 9, 15]. This has resulted in 
a change in the proportion of females that feed on human 
blood [10], and thus has altered the malaria transmis-
sion dynamics [16, 17]. The behavioural plasticity in host 
choice, demonstrated by either an individual or a popula-
tion, is likely constrained by the mosquitoes’ host prefer-
ence that delineates a hierarchy of acceptable blood hosts 
[14, 18]. Understanding the mechanisms underlying the 
host discrimination process in An. arabiensis may guide 
the development of new vector control strategies based 
on sustained modification of mosquito behaviour.
Host selection in mosquitoes is determined by both 
intrinsic and extrinsic factors [14, 18]. One important 
extrinsic factor is the availability of host species, which 
may be a crucial determinant of host choice, especially 
for opportunistic mosquito species [14, 18, 19]. The for-
age ratio assesses the dependence of host choice on host 
availability by comparing the proportion of blood meals 
from a particular host species with their relative abun-
dance in the environment [20]. For example, the propor-
tion of An. arabiensis female mosquitoes that blood feed 
on humans is higher in indoor-caught mosquitoes, and 
in the absence of cattle in the surrounding area [21, 22]. 
Host choice in An. arabiensis, however, does not always 
overlap with host availability, as the species appears to 
have a low preference for birds, regardless of their abun-
dance [22–25]. This discrimination suggests that An. ara-
biensis has evolved mechanisms to differentiate between 
potential host species.
Anopheles mosquitoes primarily use their sense of 
smell to locate suitable hosts. Qualitative differences in 
the detected volatile profiles associated with the vari-
ous hosts provide a chemical signature on which female 
host selection relies [26]. Different combinations of these 
volatile host-related attractants have been employed in 
the development of bait technologies for the control of 
Anopheles mosquitoes [27]. Research on herbivorous 
and other blood-feeding insects also indicates that host 
choice involves repellents, so-called non-host volatiles 
(NHVs) that act together with host attractants during 
host discrimination [28–31]. NHVs can be exploited for 
the manipulation of blood-feeding insects, as shown for 
example in the Morsitans group of tsetse flies, Glossina 
spp., which transmit trypanosomiasis (nagana) in cattle 
[29–31].
Through vertebrate host abundance and blood meal 
analyses, multiple hosts and a single non-host species of 
field-caught An. arabiensis were identified. A comparison 
of the olfactory responses of female An. arabiensis to vol-
atile headspace extracts collected from the non-human 
hosts and the non-host revealed both generic and spe-
cies-specific compounds. Based on the combined results 
of these analyses, this study hypothesized that spe-
cific compounds identified in the volatile extract of the 
non-host constitute a protective chemical barrier. This 
hypothesis was tested by evaluating the response of host-
seeking An. arabiensis, to identify NHVs in field trials.
Methods
Population data on potential host species
Data on the population of human and domestic ani-
mals from three villages, Wama Kusaye (8°58.695′N, 
36°48.558′E; 1443 m above sea level), Baka-Boro 
(8°57.715′N, 36°52.058′E; 1522 m above sea level) and 
Machara (8°58.028′N, 36°42.994′E; 1514 m), in the East 
Wollega Zone of western Ethiopia was obtained from 
agricultural extension workers and the local adminis-
tration office. The common practice in this region is for 
livestock and people to share their living quarters, and 
as such, the assumption was made that the availability of 
potential hosts is similar both indoors and outdoors.
Mosquito collection and blood meal analysis
Blood-fed mosquitoes were collected from the three vil-
lages on five separate days, using standard collection 
methods [32]. Indoor resting mosquitoes were collected 
in ten houses, in each village, from 06:00 to 08:00. Mos-
quito-knockdown collections were performed by spray-
ing with Kilit™ (Miswa Chemicals Ltd, UK), a synthetic 
pyrethrum. Outdoor-resting mosquitoes were surveyed 
at five pit shelters dug for the purpose (1.5 × 1.0 × 2.0 m, 
with horizontal ‘pockets’ dug in the four walls of each) 
[32] in each village.
Anopheles mosquitoes were counted and then sorted 
by sex, abdominal condition (unfed, freshly fed, half 
gravid and gravid), and species using morphological keys 
[33]. The Anopheles mosquitoes that were provisionally 
identified as An. gambiae s.l., were screened using poly-
merase chain reaction (PCR) described by Scott et al. [34] 
and conclusively identified.
Freshly blood-fed mosquitoes were cut transversely 
between the thorax and the abdomen, and the poste-
rior portions containing the blood meal were tested for 
source host blood by the direct enzyme-linked immuno-
sorbent assay (ELISA) [35]. Commercially available anti-
host (IgG) conjugates against human, cattle, goat, sheep 
and chicken (Kirkegard and Perry Laboratories, MD, 
USA) were used in the ELISA. Control samples consisted 
of blood drawn from a human (KTJ), and blood obtained

from cow, sheep and goat (Addis Ababa Abattoirs enter-
prise), as well as chicken blood obtained from a local 
restaurant. Each mosquito was tested simultaneously for 
human, cattle, goat, sheep, and chicken antibodies. Sig-
nificant differences in blood meals found in indoor- and 
outdoor-resting mosquitoes were determined using Chi 
squared (χ2) analyses (Prism v. 5, GraphPad, CA, USA).
Forage ratio
The forage ratio was calculated as the proportion of host 
species present in blood meals of An. arabiensis divided 
by the proportion of host species available in the environ-
ment [36].
Volatile headspace collections
Headspace collections were obtained from cows, sheep, 
goats, and chicken. For this purpose, at least five indi-
viduals of each species were randomly selected from 
the Wama Kusaye village. The host hair, wool or feath-
ers were cut with sterilized scissors, enclosed in separate 
polyacetete bags (Toppits, Melitta, Sweden) and immedi-
ately transported to the laboratory. The mixed hair, wool 
or feathers (20 ± 1 g) were placed in a glass wash bottle. 
A charcoal-filtered, continuous airstream (100 ml min−1) 
was drawn by a diaphragm vacuum pump (KNF Neu-
berger, Freiburg, Germany) through the bottle onto an 
aeration column for 24 h. The aeration column consisted 
of a Teflon tube (4 mm diameter × 40 mm length) hold-
ing 30 mg Porapak Q (80/100 mesh, Alltech, Deerfield, 
IL, USA) between polypropylene wool plugs. Adsorbed 
volatiles were desorbed by eluting each column with 
500 µl of re-distilled n-hexane (≥99.9 % purity, Merck 
KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) and condensed under N2 to 
approximately one-quarter of the volume. Samples were 
stored at −20 °C.
Mosquito rearing
Anopheles arabiensis (Dongola strain) were maintained at 
27 ± 2 °C, 70 ± 2 % relative humidity and at a light:dark 
cycle of 12:12 h. Larvae were reared in plastic trays 
(20 × 18 × 7 cm) and fed Tetramin™ fish food (Tetra, 
Melle, Germany). Pupae were transferred to Bugdorm 
cages (30 × 30 × 30 cm, MegaView Science, Taiwan) 
for adults to emerge. Adults were provided 10 % sucrose 
solution ad libitum. For colony maintenance, female mos-
quitoes were provided with sheep blood (Håtunalab, Bro, 
Sweden) using an artificial feeder (Hemotek, Discovery 
Workshops, Accrington, UK). Electrophysiological anal-
ysis was conducted on four- to six-day post-emergence 
non-blood fed female mosquitoes.
Electrophysiology
Antennal responses to the headspace volatile collec-
tions were examined by combined gas chromatography 
(GC) and electroantennographic detection (EAD) analy-
sis as well as electro-antennography (EAG) using an 
EAG system (IDAC-2; Syntech, Kirchgarten, Germany) 
and an Agilent 6890 N GC (Agilent Technologies, Santa 
Clara, CA, USA). For the GC-EAD analysis, the GC was 
equipped with a HP-5MS (Agilent Technologies) fused 
silica capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm; df = 0.25 µm). 
Hydrogen was used as mobile phase (Q = 45 cm s−1). 
Two µl of each sample were injected (splitless mode, 30 s, 
injector temperature 225 °C). The GC oven tempera-
ture gradient was programmed from 30 °C (4-min hold) 
at 8 °C min−1 to 250 °C (5-min hold). To the GC efflu-
ent, 4 psi of nitrogen was added and split 1:1 in a Gerstel 
3D/2 low dead volume four way-cross (Gerstel, Mülheim, 
Germany) between the flame ionization detector and 
the EAD. The GC effluent capillary for the EAD passed 
through a Gerstel olfactory detection port-2 transfer 
line, which mirrored the GC oven temperature, into a 
glass tube (8 mm diameter × 10 cm length), where it was 
mixed with charcoal-filtered, humidified air (1 l min−1). 
The antenna was placed 0.5 cm from the outlet of this 
tube.
For EAG recordings, the excised head of a female An. 
arabiensis was used. After removing the distal tip of the 
first flagellomere of one antenna, it was inserted into 
a recording glass electrode filled with Beadle-Ephrussi 
ringer (140 mM NaCl, 4.7 mM KCl, 1.9 mM CaCl2·2H2O) 
and connected to a pre-amplifier (10×) probe connected 
to a high impedance DC amplifier interface box (IDAC-
2; Syntech). The indifferent electrode was inserted into 
the occipital foramen. At least six GC-EAD runs were 
made for each headspace volatile collection on different 
preparations.
Chemical analysis
Volatile collections were analysed on a combined gas 
chromatography and mass spectrometer (GC–MS) 
(6890 GC and 5975 MS; Agilent Technologies) oper-
ated in the electron impact ionization mode at 70 eV. 
The GC was equipped with a similar column as for 
the GC-EAD analysis. Helium was used as the mobile 
phase (Q = 35 cm s−1). The GC oven temperature was 
programmed as for the GC-EAD analysis above. Com-
pounds were identified according to their Kovat’s indi-
ces and mass spectra in comparison with custom made 
and NIST-05 libraries, and confirmed by co-injection of 
authentic standards (Additional file 1).

Dose–response experiments
For further verification of the physiological activity of 
the chemicals identified through GC-EAD and GC-MS 
analyses, dose–response experiments were conducted 
by EAG recordings using synthetic standards (Addi-
tional file 1). Concentrations ranged in decadic steps 
from 0.001 to 10 % (volume/volume) for each synthetic 
compound. Dilutions of compounds were prepared in 
redistilled n-hexane (LabScan, Malmö, Sweden), except 
for furfuryl alcohol for which absolute ethanol was used 
(LabScan). Odour stimuli were produced by loading 10 µl 
of each diluted synthetic test compound onto a filter 
paper (1 × 1.5 cm, Munktell Filter AB, Sweden) inserted 
inside a glass Pasteur pipette. Pipettes with formulated 
filter papers were kept for 30 min in a fume hood prior 
to use to allow for solvent evaporation. The pipette was 
connected via a silicone tube to a stimulus generator 
(CS-55; Syntech) and the tip of the pipette was inserted 
into the glass tube with an air flow (1 l min−1) directed 
towards the antenna. Stimuli were produced by puffing 
air (0.5 l min−1) through the pipette during 0.5 s; each 
pipette was used only once. Hexane was used as a solvent 
blank, as the first and last stimulus for every replicate, 
except ethanol that was used as a solvent blank for fur-
furyl alcohol. Each set of odour stimuli was tested on one 
antenna (n = 6). The responses to each test stimulus were 
calculated by subtracting the averaged response ampli-
tude of the solvent controls from the response amplitude 
of the stimulus.
Field evaluation of identified host and non‑host volatiles
Field experiments were conducted in the Wama Kusaye 
village. In the village, 11 thatched houses were selected 
based on similarities in size, with houses separated 
approximately 200 m apart. The experimental design fol-
lowed a Latin square, in which treatments were randomly 
assigned to houses on the first day and then rotated 
between houses to minimize location bias over the fol-
lowing days, for a total of 11 days. The experiments were 
conducted in November and December 2012, i.e., after 
the long rainy season, when host-seeking An. arabiensis 
were readily available. In each house, a single volunteer 
(27–36 years old) slept under an untreated bed net. A 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) mini-
light trap (BioQuip Products, Inc, CA, USA), with the 
light bulb removed, was hung next to the foot of the bed 
net, approximately 1 m above ground level. Ethical clear-
ance was obtained from the Ethical Committee of the 
Faculty of Science, Addis Ababa University conforming 
to the WMA Declaration of Helsinki.
Synthetic compounds of nine of the GC-EAD active 
compounds identified in the volatile headspace collec-
tions of the non-host (chicken) and hosts (cattle, goats, 
and sheep) of An. arabiensis were used in the study. 
Dispenser vials (PE# 733, Kartell, Italy), each contain-
ing 0.5 g of a synthetic compound released at a rate of 
1 mg h−1, were suspended approximately 10 cm beside 
and 20 cm below the trap using wire hooks (Fig. 1). The 
required release rate was achieved by varying the num-
ber of caps attached to each trap, and the size of the hole 
in the cap from which the chemical could volatilize. The 
number of caps and hole size required was determined: 
full caps were weighed and reweighed after 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 
6, 12, and 24 h of exposure to field conditions (25 ± 1 °C, 
60 % RH). This procedure was repeated six times to cal-
culate an average release rate for each compound. As a 
negative control, a similar trap, with solvent alone, was 
used. In addition, a caged chicken surrounded by a fine 
mesh screen, to prevent chicken-mosquito interactions, 
and suspended in a similar way as the dispensers, served 
as a control (Fig. 1). The traps were turned on at 18:00 
and turned off the following morning at 06:00. Caught 
mosquitoes were enumerated and identified to species, as 
described above. The effect of compounds on the num-
ber of mosquitoes caught (distributed response variable) 
was subjected to a generalized linear mixed effect model 
procedure (GLMM, lmer) in the R statistical software 
version 3.1.1. (“house” and “day” were controlled for as 
random effects). The model used a Poisson distribution 
and log-link function for its construction, and AIC was 
used for model evaluation. For a comparative analysis 
among the different compounds, a posthoc test, adjusted 
for multiple comparisons, was performed on a linear 
mixed effects model (R, lme4, multcomp; Chi squared, χ2; 
P < 0.05).
Results
Mosquito species identification and composition
Four species of Anopheles mosquitoes, An. arabiensis, 
Anopheles funestus s. l., Anopheles nili and Anopheles 
coustani, were collected and identified in the study vil-
lages (n = 4844). Anopheles arabiensis, as determined 
by PCR analysis of 386 mosquitoes (more than 5 % of 
the mosquitoes caught), was the most abundant spe-
cies, comprising more than 98.5 % of the total mosqui-
toes caught. A total of 4739 female An. arabiensis were 
collected from the study villages, using pyrethrum spray 
sheet collections (n = 1036, 758 and 503 for Wama Kus-
saye, Baka-Boro and Machara, respectively) and artificial 
pit shelters (n = 1264, 639 and 539 for Wama Kussaye, 
Baka-Boro and Machara, respectively). During the field 
evaluation of the non-host volatiles, two species of mos-
quitoes, An. arabiensis and An. coustani, were collected 
and identified. Anopheles arabiensis, as determined by 
PCR, was the most abundant species comprising more 
than 97 % of the total mosquitoes caught (n = 583).

Host‑species abundance and feeding preference 
of Anopheles arabiensis
Preferred and non-preferred host species of An. arabi-
ensis were identified through analyses of host abundance 
and blood meal prevalence (Table 1). Cattle were the 
most abundant host species in all villages, with humans 
one-third and chickens two-thirds less abundant. The 
number of females feeding on human and cattle hosts 
differed significantly between indoor and outdoor events 
(χ2 = 186.7, P < 0.0001; χ2 = 18.8, P < 0.001, respectively; 
Table 1). Calculated forage ratios (Table 1) showed a high 
preference of An. arabiensis for humans as a source of a 
blood meal when collected indoors (>2), but a low prefer-
ence, with a forage ratio <1 indicative of avoidance, when 
collected outdoors. An almost diametrically opposite 
forage ratio was found for cattle indoors, indicating that 
An. arabiensis actively avoid cattle when searching for a 
blood meal indoors. For goat and sheep, the calculated 
forage ratio was ca. 1 indicating that An. arabiensis ran-
domly feed on these hosts both indoors and outdoors. 
Interestingly, the calculated forage ratio for chicken (0) 
indicates that chickens are a non-host, despite its rela-
tively high abundance.
GC‑EAD and GC‑MS analyses of headspace volatile 
collections
A total of 25 GC-EAD active compounds were identified 
in the headspace volatile collections from the non-human 
hosts: cattle, sheep and goat (Table 2). Four of these com-
pounds co-occurred in all of the collections, while nine 
compounds co-occurred in two of the three collections. 
The generic compounds identified in the headspace vola-
tile collections of all non-human host species included 
limonene, nonanal, phenyl acetaldehyde, and sulcatone. 
Species-specific compounds included 2-butoxyethanol, 
E2-heptenal, neral, and furfuryl alcohol in cattle; benzyl 
alcohol and heptanal in goat; and 1-methylnaphthalene, 
p-cymene, m-propylphenol, and cis-dihydrocarvone in 
sheep.
In the headspace volatile collection from the non-host, 
chicken, 11 GC-EAD active compounds were detected 
(Table 2). Of these, limonene, β-myrcene, nonanal, sul-
catone and cis-limonene oxide were also found within 
volatile collections of one or more of the non-human 
hosts. The remaining compounds, hexadecane, naphtha-
lene, isobutyl butanoate and trans-limonene oxide, were 
specific to chicken. This study was unable to confirm 
the identity of two chicken-specific compounds using 
commercially available synthetic standards and are here 
referred to as unknown 1 and 2.
For further verification of the physiological activity of 
the compounds identified through GC-EAD and GC-MS 
analyses, dose–response experiments were conducted by 
EAG recordings using synthetic standards (Additional 
file 1). The EAG dose–response analysis of the GC-EAD 
active compounds demonstrated that An. arabiensis 
Fig. 1 CDC suction traps used in the field experiment were placed at the foot of a bed with a volunteer sleeping under a bed net. Dispenser vials, 
releasing test compounds at a rate of 1 mg h−1, were suspended next to the traps (a). As a control, a live caged chicken was used in lieu of the 
dispenser (b)

respond to all tested synthetics in a dose-dependent 
manner, and confirmed that the antennae were differen-
tially sensitive to these compounds (Additional file 2).
Field evaluation of non‑host and generic volatiles
Overall, the tested volatiles had a significant effect 
on trap catches when tested in the field using suction 
CDC traps (CDC traps without light; χ2
10 = 226.76, 
P < 0.001; Figs. 1 and 2). Traps baited individually with 
the chicken-specific volatiles, isobutyl butanoate, naph-
thalene, hexadecane and trans-limonene oxide, and with 
the generic compounds, limonene, cis-limonene oxide 
and β-myrcene, caught significantly fewer An. arabien-
sis compared to the solvent baited negative control trap 
(Fig. 2). Similarly, a significantly lower number of mos-
quitoes were caught in a trap baited with a live, caged 
chicken (Fig. 2). In contrast, CDC traps baited with either 
of the generic compounds, sulcatone or nonanal, did not 
affect the number of An. arabiensis caught, compared to 
the solvent baited negative control trap (Fig. 2).
Discussion
Anopheles arabiensis is a selective blood feeder when 
host-seeking indoors, which prefers human blood and 
avoids cattle blood. In contrast, when found outdoors, 
An. arabiensis is an opportunistic blood feeder, randomly 
feeding on cattle, goats and sheep and avoiding humans. 
The breadth of the host range suggests that the use of 
alternative hosts may be important in maintaining the 
local mosquito population density, and thus affects the 
risk of malaria transmission. While An. arabiensis feeds 
on many abundant vertebrate species, this study shows 
that it avoids chickens despite their relatively high abun-
dance. These results are consistent with previous studies 
[22–25], implying that An. arabiensis, although opportun-
istic, exhibits non-random feeding on available hosts. The 
selective advantage of such behaviour may be explained 
by variation in nutritional rewards and the corresponding 
fitness accruing from feeding on different host types [18]. 
Variation in physical and chemical properties of the blood 
between host species may be a driver for the evolution of 
host-choice in An. arabiensis. This could be a factor con-
tributing to the avoidance of chicken as a host [18, 37]. 
Additional factors that can influence the feeding success 
of mosquitoes are the physical barrier to mosquito feed-
ing provided by the feathers as well as the chicken’s prey 
behaviour, since the birds will actively feed on mosquitoes.
Volatile compounds identified in the headspace 
extracts of chicken feathers appear to play a pivotal role 
in the observed non-host avoidance. Compounds that 
were able to disrupt the host-seeking behaviour of An. 
arabiensis included both chicken-specific and generic 
volatiles. This suggests that these volatiles function as 
medium- to long-range repellents. Of the identified com-
pounds, naphthalene has previously been found at higher 
levels in ‘non-attractive’ individuals of humans and cattle, 
in which it appears to either repel or mask the response 
of the biting midge Culicoides impunctatus [38] and cat-
tle flies [39] to normally attractive compounds. Limonene 
oxides and β-myrcene have not been identified previ-
ously in the odour profile of vertebrates, but are known 
to be botanical insect repellents [40, 41]. Although many 
studies have demonstrated that haematophagous insects 
show feeding preferences for certain host species, this is 
the first to implicate non-host volatiles in the differen-
tial host attractiveness to mosquitoes. Previous work on 
tsetse flies, however, suggests that NHVs are an impor-
tant part of the host selection process in haematopha-
gous insects [31]. The adaptive value of the behavioural 
response to NHVs is likely linked to higher fecundity and 
survival after feeding on preferred host species than on 
non-preferred hosts [18].

Non-host volatiles, acting either as repellents or mask-
ing agents, can be developed to be used in concert with 
established integrated vector management programs. 
Proof of principle for this has been shown for tsetse flies, 
where compounds identified in waterbuck act as potent 
non-host repellents [31]. Moreover, compounds identi-
fied in a non-host fish, turbot, when added to salmon-
conditioned water, have been shown to interfere with the 
host-seeking behaviour of the salmon louse [42].
Conclusions
This study demonstrates that NHVs have the potential to 
afford protection to people at risk of contracting a mos-
quito-vectored disease, in combination with established 
control programmes. Future work will be aimed at deter-
mining the efficacy and duration of protection of a spatial 
repellent product formulated according to WHO’s guide-
lines [43]. With the increasing reports on insecticide 
resistance among disease vectors, it is incumbent on the
