BACKGROUND
Peripartum cardiomyopathy shares some clinical features with idiopathic dilated car-
diomyopathy, a disorder caused by mutations in more than 40 genes, including TTN, 
which encodes the sarcomere protein titin.
METHODS
In 172 women with peripartum cardiomyopathy, we sequenced 43 genes with variants that 
have been associated with dilated cardiomyopathy. We compared the prevalence of differ-
ent variant types (nonsense, frameshift, and splicing) in these women with the prevalence 
of such variants in persons with dilated cardiomyopathy and with population controls.
RESULTS
We identified 26 distinct, rare truncating variants in eight genes among women with 
peripartum cardiomyopathy. The prevalence of truncating variants (26 in 172 [15%]) 
was significantly higher than that in a reference population of 60,706 persons (4.7%, 
P 
= 
1.3×10−7) but was similar to that in a cohort of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy 
(55 of 332 patients [17%], P 
= 
0.81). Two thirds of identified truncating variants were 
in TTN, as seen in 10% of the patients and in 1.4% of the reference population 
(P 
= 
2.7×10−10); almost all TTN variants were located in the titin A-band. Seven of the 
TTN truncating variants were previously reported in patients with idiopathic dilated 
cardiomyopathy. In a clinically well-characterized cohort of 83 women with peripartum 
cardiomyopathy, the presence of TTN truncating variants was significantly correlated 
with a lower ejection fraction at 1-year follow-up (P 
= 
0.005).
CONCLUSIONS
The distribution of truncating variants in a large series of women with peripartum 
cardiomyopathy was remarkably similar to that found in patients with idiopathic 
dilated cardiomyopathy. TTN truncating variants were the most prevalent genetic pre-
disposition in each disorder.

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
P
eripartum cardiomyopathy is marked 
by the development of maternal systolic 
heart failure late in pregnancy or early in 
the postpartum period.1,2 The incidence varies 
from 1 in 100 to 1 in 300 in geographic hot 
spots, including Nigeria and Haiti, to 1 in 1000 
to 1 in 4000 in Europe and the United States. 
The strongest known risk factors are the pres-
ence of preeclampsia, twin gestation, and ad-
vanced maternal age. Among patients with peri-
partum cardiomyopathy, heart failure can resolve 
but often does not: rates of death of 5 to 10% 
are common, and 4% of cardiac transplantations 
in the United States among women are performed 
for the treatment of peripartum cardiomyopathy.
The cause of peripartum cardiomyopathy re-
mains unknown. Hypotheses include fetal auto-
immunity or microchimerism, myocarditis, and 
dietary excess of salt or deficiency of selenium.1-3 
Previous studies have suggested that peripartum 
cardiomyopathy is largely a vascular disease, 
triggered by the hormonal milieu of late gesta-
tion and the early postpartum period.3-5 There 
are no clear explanations for why heart failure 
develops in only a small subgroup of women in 
these contexts.
Peripartum cardiomyopathy shares some clini-
cal features with idiopathic dilated cardiomy-
opathy, including decreased systolic function, 
enlarged cardiac dimensions, and nonspecific 
histologic findings on biopsy. Mutations in a 
number of genes have been shown to cause idio-
pathic dilated cardiomyopathy. These genes in-
clude TTN, which encodes the sarcomere protein 
titin. Up to 25% of patients with familial dilated 
cardiomyopathy and 18% of those with sporadic 
dilated cardiomyopathy harbor deleterious trun-
cating variants (i.e., variants that are predicted to 
result in the truncation of translation) in TTN.6
Some evidence supports the hypothesis that 
peripartum cardiomyopathy may have a heredi-
tary or genetic component. Geographic hot spots 
of incidence, including Nigeria and Haiti, may 
reflect genetic factors, and a genomewide asso-
ciation study identified a locus near the gene 
encoding parathyroid hormone–like hormone 
(PTHLH).7 Although hot spots could be environ-
mental, familial clustering of peripartum cardio-
myopathy has been noted,8-11 and 15% of pa-
tients in a German cohort had a family history 
of cardiomyopathy (defined as the presence of 
peripartum cardiomyopathy, dilated cardiomyop-
athy, sudden death, or arrhythmias in a first-
degree relative).12 Two groups of investigators 
who have studied rare pedigrees affected by 
these two types of cardiomyopathies have identi-
fied variants in genes encoding myofibrillar pro-
teins, including TTN.13,14 However, very few cases 
of peripartum cardiomyopathy are clearly familial 
or associated with dilated cardiomyopathy. A ge-
netic underpinning to the great majority of cases 
of peripartum cardiomyopathy remains uncertain.
We therefore sequenced DNA from 172 women 
with peripartum cardiomyopathy to determine 
the contribution of variants in 43 genes that 
have been previously associated with dilated 
cardiomyopathy.
Methods
Patients
Patients with peripartum cardiomyopathy were 
recruited from six independent groups. Group A 
was recruited from a cohort of patients who 
underwent either cardiac transplantation or place-
ment of a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) at 
Temple University in Philadelphia. Group B was 
recruited from a cohort of patients that included 
some who had been referred for cardiac trans-
plantation and who were being treated in a 
clinic at the University of Pennsylvania in Phila-
delphia. Group C was recruited from a cohort of 
patients who had been referred to a peripartum 
cardiomyopathy clinic at the University of Han-
nover in Hannover, Germany. Group D consist-
ed of a subgroup of 9 women from a cohort of 
100 Japanese women with peripartum cardio-
myopathy from whom samples were obtained.15 
Group E consisted of patients in the multicenter, 
prospective Intervention in Myocarditis and Acute 
Cardiomyopathy 2 (IMAC-2) study,16 which en-
rolled patients with acute nonischemic cardio-
myopathy, including a subgroup with peripartum 
cardiomyopathy. Group F consisted of patients 
who were enrolled in the Investigations in Preg-
nancy Associated Cardiomyopathy (IPAC) trial, a 
multicenter, prospective study involving women 
with peripartum cardiomyopathy.17,18 The study 
was approved by the institutional review board 
at each study center. All the patients provided 
written informed consent.
Reference groups were taken from the Exome

Massachusetts (http://exac

which contains more than 60,000 exomes, 
and the Exome Variant Server (data release, 
ESP6500SI-V2; evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS), which 
contains exomic sequences from 6503 persons. 
For comparison, patients with dilated cardiomy-
opathy were recruited at the Royal Brompton 
and Harefield NHS Foundation Trust in London, 
as described previously.19
DNA Sequencing and Analyses
We constructed bar-coded sequencing libraries 
from genomic DNA obtained from 172 patients 
with peripartum cardiomyopathy and 332 pa-
tients with dilated cardiomyopathy. The libraries 
were enriched for protein-coding portions of 
43 genes that when mutated cause dilated car-
diomyopathy and were then sequenced (Table S1 
in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the 
full text of this article at NEJM.org). The 43 genes 
comprise the great majority of genes known to be 
associated with dilated cardiomyopathy and were 
present on the two platforms that were used to 
sequence patients with peripartum cardiomyopa-
thy and those with dilated cardiomyopathy.
For the peripartum-cardiomyopathy libraries, 
genes were captured with the use of SureSelect 
Target Enrichment (Agilent Technologies) and 
sequenced on the HiSeq 2500 sequencing system 
(Illumina). Reads were aligned to hg19 (GRCh37) 
with the use of NovoAlign, version 3.02.04 (Novo-
craft), with measurements set for full Needleman–
Wunsch alignments and a gap penalty of 10. 
Variants were identified with the use of the Ge-
nome Analysis Tool Kit (GATK) HaplotypeCaller 
tool on the basis of GATK Best Practices.20 Vari-
ants were annotated with the use of SnpEff and 
GRCh37.68.21 In samples obtained from patients 
with dilated cardiomyopathy, genes were captured 
with the use of in-solution hybridization and 
sequenced on the SOLiD 5500XL (Applied Bio-
systems). Reads were demultiplexed, optimized 
with the use of the SOLiD Accuracy Enhance-
ment Tool, and aligned to hg19 with the use of 
the SOLiD targeted resequencing pipeline. Vari-
ants were identified with the use of LifeScope 
genomic analysis software, version 2.5.1, with 
default measurements, and annotated with the 
use of the Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor (API 
version 75 on GRCh37).22
Statistical Analysis
We used either Fisher’s exact test (for two-tailed 
analyses) or Pearson’s chi-square test of associa-
tion for cross-cohort and cross-group analyses. 
The frequency of truncating variations was com-
pared between cohorts with the use of the bino-
mial test. Analyses were performed with the use 
of the R statistical package.
Results
Study Patients
A total of 172 women with peripartum cardio-
myopathy were recruited from the six cohorts 
(Table 1). Approximately one third of the pa-
tients were of African descent, consistent with 
the known increased prevalence of peripartum 
cardiomyopathy in this group. Ancestry was de-
fined genetically by means of principle-compo-
nent analysis of all common variants that were 
sequenced (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appen-
dix). The ejection fraction was lowest in group A, 
which consisted of patients who were under 
evaluation for cardiac transplantation.
DNA Sequencing
Next-generation sequencing was performed on 
43 genes, including TTN (Table S1 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix). More than 95% of targeted 
bases were sequenced to a read depth of more 
than 20 times (data not shown). Rare variants 
(ExAC frequency, <0.1%) were chosen for further 
analysis. We focused on truncating variants that 
included nonsense, frameshift, and splicing vari-
ants, because they are predicted to have a strong 
effect on protein structure and function. All 
truncating variants were confirmed by means of 
traditional Sanger sequencing.
Genetic Variation in Peripartum 
Cardiomyopathy
Among the 172 women with peripartum cardio-
myopathy, we identified 26 who carried 26 dis-
tinct rare heterozygous truncating variants in 
eight different genes (Table S2 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix). No homozygous or compound 
heterozygous truncating variants were observed. 
Eleven variants were nonsense, seven were 
frameshift, and eight affected canonical splicing 
sites. The prevalence of truncating variants did 
not differ significantly among the six cohorts

(Table 1). The overall prevalence of truncating 
variants in 26 of 172 women with peripartum 
cardiomyopathy (15%) was significantly higher 
than that in the ExAC reference population of 
more than 60,000 samples (4.7%, P 
= 
1.3×10−7) 
and similar to that in a cohort of patients with 
dilated cardiomyopathy (55 of 332 patients [17%], 
P 
= 
0.81).
Of the 26 truncating variants, 17 (65%) af-
fected TTN (in 10% of the cohort; P 
= 
2.7×10−10 
for the comparison with the reference popula-
tion). TTN truncating variants were seen in 8 of 
61 women of African descent (13%) and 8 of 102 
women of European descent (8%). In the refer-
ence ExAC population, such variants were found 
in 2.1% of persons of African descent (P 
= 
3.8×10−5) 
and in 1.1% of those of European descent 
(P 
= 
1.4×10−5). Four of the TTN truncating vari-
ants (two nonsense and two splice-site donors) 
were identical to variants previously identified in 
26 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy who 
were studied at Brigham and Women’s Hospital 
in Boston (Table S3 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix). Three of these variants were absent 
from the more than 60,000 exomes in the ExAC 
database, and one was identified only once. Five 
of the TTN truncating variants (in 3% of the 172 
women) are also identical to variants annotated 
as probably pathogenic for dilated cardiomyopa-
thy in the ClinVar database (www 
. 
ncbi 
. 
nlm 
. 
nih 
. 
gov/ 
clinvar), as compared with a frequency of 
0.1% found in ExAC (P 
= 
1.1×10−5).
Of 17 truncating variants in TTN, 14 were 
located in a region that encodes the A-band por-
tion of the protein (Fig. 1, and Table S3 in the 
Supplementary Appendix), as compared with 21 
of 56 in a reference population19 (P 
= 
0.002). (The 
A-band, named for its anisotropic properties on 
polarized microscopy, is the portion of the sarco-
mere that contains the myosin thick filament.) 
Truncating variants in patients with dilated car-
diomyopathy cluster similarly in the region encod-
ing the A-band.6,19 Sixteen of the 17 TTN truncat-
ing variants were in exons that are constitutively 
expressed in the heart (i.e., that appear in every 
messenger RNA isoform that is transcribed from 
the gene) (Fig. 1, and Table S3 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix), as compared with 83 of 168 vari-
ants 
in 
the 
Exome 
Sequencing 
Project 
(P 
= 
1.1×10−4). 
This finding again reflects the pattern seen in 
patients with dilated cardiomyopathy.19 Truncat-
ing variants were more likely to be positioned in 
the region of the gene encoding the C-terminal 
regions of the protein (Fig. 1). In persons with 
dilated cardiomyopathy, truncating variants that 
are found near the C-terminus are associated 
with more severe disease than are N-terminal 
truncating variants.19
The prevalence of missense variants among 
the 172 women with peripartum cardiomyopathy 
was high (1.06 per person among women of 
African descent and 1.25 per person among those 
of European descent) and was not significantly 
different from the burden found in the ExAc

cohort (1.26 per person among women of African 
descent [P 
= 
0.21] and 1.19 per person among 
those of European descent [P 
= 
0.59]). No mis-
sense variants that were annotated in ClinVar as 
pathogenic or probably pathogenic for dilated 
cardiomyopathy were identified among the 
women with peripartum cardiomyopathy. Three 
missense variants that are associated in ClinVar 
with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy were identi-
fied in MYH7 (encoding a myosin heavy-chain 
isoform expressed mainly in the heart) in the 
172 women with peripartum cardiomyopathy 
(P 
= 
0.10 for the comparison with the reference 
population), and seven missense variants reported 
in association with the long-QT syndrome were 
identified in SCN5A (encoding a voltage-gated 
sodium-channel isoform) in these women (P 
= 
0.02 
for the comparison with the reference population).
 
Clinical Characteristics
At baseline, there were no significant differences 
with respect to age, ancestry, or ejection fraction 
between the women with truncating variants 
and those without such variants (Table 2). In 
the IPAC study,17,18 enrollment took place within 
13 weeks after delivery, which was followed by 
comprehensive clinical evaluation during 1-year 
follow-up. Of 83 women in the IPAC study, 15 
(18%) carried truncating variants, including 11 
(13%) who had such variants in TTN. During the 
index pregnancy, there were no significant dif-
ferences between the women with truncating 
Figure 1. Titin Protein and Spatial Distribution of Variants in the Protein.
Titin, a protein encoded by TTN, makes up one of the three major filaments of the cardiac sarcomere, the basic unit of striated muscle 
tissue. Regions of the sarcomere are designated as the Z-disk (red), I-band (named for its isotropic properties under a polarizing micro-
scope, shown in blue), A-band (named for its anisotropic properties, shown in green), and M-band (from the German mittelscheibe, the 
disk in the middle of the sarcomere, shown in purple). The spatial distributions of the truncating variants that were found in samples 
obtained from patients with peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) are indicated, along with the dis-
tributions of such variants in healthy controls. At the bottom of the diagram, the genomic locus of TTN is shown. N2BA and N2B denote 
the exons (vertical lines) encoding the two main cardiac transcripts. For PSI (i.e., the proportion spliced in), the height of the vertical 
line indicates the proportion of cardiac transcripts obtained from patients with dilated cardiomyopathy that contain the exon. Images

variants and those without such variants with 
respect to age, the number of previous pregnan-
cies, or the number of previous births (Table 3). 
The reported prevalence of a family history of 
peripartum or dilated cardiomyopathy was simi-
larly low in the two study groups (10%). Fewer 
patients with TTN truncating variants had hy-
pertension than did those without such variants 
(P 
= 
0.009). The burden of TTN truncating vari-
ants among the women without hypertension 
(10 of 43 [23%]) was significantly higher than 
that among those with hypertension (1 of 40 
[2%]) (P 
= 
0.005).
In the IPAC study, cardiac function at presen-
tation was not significantly different between 
the women with TTN truncating variants and 
those without such variants (mean [±SD] left 
ventricular ejection fraction, 30±12% and 35±9%, 
respectively; P 
= 
0.14). However, a year after en-
rollment, the ejection fraction was significantly 
lower in the group with TTN truncating variants 
than in those without such variants (44±17 and 
54±8%, P 
= 
0.005). The majority of TTN truncat-
ing variants in the IPAC cohort (7 of 11) were 
found among women of African descent. At the 
1-year follow-up, significant differences in the 
ejection fraction were observed within this sub-
group of women (38±16% with TTN variants vs. 
52±12% without TTN variants, P 
= 
0.04) but not 
in the smaller number of women of European 
descent (56±17% vs. 55±10%, P 
= 
0.75). There 
were no significant between-group differences in 
the incidence of LVAD placement, cardiac trans-
plantation, or death, although the total number 
of such events was small (data not shown).
In the IMAC-2 study,16 4 of the women (3 of 
European descent) carried TTN truncating vari-
ants (Table 4). Within this smaller cohort, no 
significant differences were seen in the ejection

Discussion
We identified truncating variants in eight genes 
among 26 of 172 women with peripartum car-
diomyopathy. The prevalence of truncating vari-
ants in these genes was significantly higher 
among these women (15%) than in the reference 
group (P 
= 
1.3×10−7), and most of the variants oc-
curred in TTN. We conclude that many of these 
truncating variants lead to a strong genetic pre-
disposition to peripartum cardiomyopathy. How-
ever, the presence of the more common variants 
probably is not a risk factor for penetrant peri-
partum cardiomyopathy in isolation, although 
such variants may be risk alleles for the disease.
The burden of genetic variants that were 
found in the women with peripartum cardiomy-
opathy resembled that found in patients with 
dilated cardiomyopathy. Most notably, 65% of 
variants occurred in TTN (in 10% of the patients, 
P 
= 
2.7×10−10 for the comparison with the refer-
ence population). The great majority of these 
variants occurred in constitutively expressed 
exons and in the region encoding the A-band, 
akin to the distribution seen in patients with di-
lated cardiomyopathy.6,23 Seven of these variants 
have been found previously in association with 
dilated cardiomyopathy. Approximately 15% of 
patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and peri-
partum cardiomyopathy share the same types of 
truncating variants, so we propose that a shared 
mechanism is responsible for these cardiomy-
opathies. Since a gene-based diagnosis is clini-
cally available for dilated cardiomyopathy, it is 
plausible that the same genetic diagnosis could 
be used for peripartum cardiomyopathy with 
similar sensitivity and specificity. However, fur-
ther study is needed to understand the penetrance 
of variants identified in the context of peripar-
tum cardiomyopathy.
Reliable prognostic indicators for peripartum 
cardiomyopathy are currently lacking. In a pre-
defined, prospectively followed, and well-char-
acterized subgroup of 83 women in the IPAC 
study, we found that the ejection fraction at 
1-year follow-up was significantly lower among 
women with TTN truncating variants than 
among those without such truncating variants 
(P 
= 
0.005). Dilated cardiomyopathy similarly car-
ries a worse prognosis in the presence of truncat-
ing TTN variants.19 On the other hand, at 6-month 
follow-up of the 34 women in the IMAC-2 co-
hort, the ejection fraction was not significantly 
different among the 3 women with TTN truncat-
ing variants than among those without such 
variants. Although these data are suggestive, the 
value of genetic information in determining the 
prognosis for patients with peripartum cardio-
myopathy will require further studies.
Truncating variants occurred equally among 
patients who did not report a family history of 
cardiomyopathy and among those who did. Simi-
larly, dilated cardiomyopathy with causative TTN 
variants is frequently not familial.6 Of the 26 
truncating variants, 13 (including 8 in TTN) 
were found in women of African heritage, which 
indicates that a genetic cause of peripartum car-
diomyopathy is not exclusive to one ancestry. 
Peripartum cardiomyopathy occurs more frequent-
ly and has a poorer prognosis among women of 
African descent than among those of European 
descent,24 which may be due in part to the higher 
prevalence of TTN truncating variants among 
those of African descent.
Preeclampsia and gestational hypertension are 
strong risk factors for peripartum cardiomyopa-
thy, but there has been controversy as to whether 
cardiomyopathy that is associated with hyper-
tension may represent a separate disease from 
cardiomyopathy in the absence of hypertensive 
disorders. Among 15 women with truncating 
variants in the well-characterized IPAC cohort, 
only 4 had any form of hypertension (chronic or 
gestational), and among the 11 women with TTN 
truncating variants, only 1 had hypertension. 
This finding contrasts sharply with the overall 
47% prevalence of hypertension in the IPAC co-
hort and most other cohorts.25 The prevalences 
of preeclampsia and hypertension are higher 
among women of African descent, and yet none 
of the 7 women of African descent with a TTN 
truncating variant had a hypertensive disorder, 
whereas 15 of the 17 women of African descent 
with peripartum cardiomyopathy who did not 
carry TTN variants had hypertension (P<0.001). 
Overall, the burden of truncating TTN variants 
among women without hypertension was 10 times 
as high as that among women with hypertension

(23% vs. 2%, P 
= 
0.005), a burden that approxi-
mates that found in familial dilated cardiomy-
opathy (25%).6 These post hoc analyses suggest 
that peripartum cardiomyopathy that is associ-
ated with hypertension may reflect a different 
pathophysiologic process than that in the absence 
of hypertension and that peripartum cardiomy-
opathy in the absence of risk factors such as 
hypertension may be of genetic origin.
Two women had truncating variants in DMD 
or LAMP, genes that lie on the X chromosome. 
Mutations in these genes cause Duchenne’s mus-
cular dystrophy and Danon’s disease, respec-
tively, in male patients and more rarely in female 
patients. Cardiomyopathy is a prominent feature 
of the two diseases.26 Peripartum cardiomyopa-
thy may have occurred in these two women as a 
consequence of skewed X-chromosome inactiva-
tion27 or stresses of pregnancy superimposed on 
subclinical cardiac abnormalities. Two previous 
reports identified a DMD or LAMP2 mutation in 
a patient with peripartum cardiomyopathy.28,29
Previous studies have shown that peripartum 
hormonal changes can pose a vascular insult to 
the heart and trigger peripartum cardiomyopa-
thy.4,5,30,31 What predisposes the development of 
this disease in only a small subgroup of women 
in this context remains unclear. We identified a 
potential genetic predisposition to peripartum 
cardiomyopathy in approximately 15% of women 
in our study, owing to truncating variants pri-
marily affecting TTN. There must be additional 
environmental or genetic stimuli that explain 
why the average age at onset of dilated cardio-
myopathy for women with TTN truncating vari-
ants is 65 years,6 whereas the age at onset of 
peripartum cardiomyopathy among women with 
TTN truncating variants is 28 years. In addition, 
women with peripartum cardiomyopathy recover 
systolic cardiac function more frequently than 
do women with dilated cardiomyopathy. Thus, 
defining the mechanistic interaction between 
truncations in TTN and late gestational antivas-
cular insults will probably lead to further under-
standing of both peripartum cardiomyopathy 
and dilated cardiomyopathy.
We conclude that peripartum cardiomyopathy 
shares a genetic predisposition with both famil-
ial and sporadic idiopathic dilated cardiomy-
opathy. In addition, the presence of truncating 
variants in TTN is the most prevalent genetic 
predisposition for each of these disorders.
