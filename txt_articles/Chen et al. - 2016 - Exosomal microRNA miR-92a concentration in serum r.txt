Brown adipose tissue (BAT) dissipates energy and its activity correlates with leanness in
human adults. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography coupled with
computer tomography (PET/CT) is still the standard for measuring BAT activity, but exposes
subjects to ionizing radiation. To study BAT function in large human cohorts, novel diagnostic
tools are needed. Here we show that brown adipocytes release exosomes and that BAT
activation increases exosome release. Profiling miRNAs in exosomes released from brown
adipocytes, and in exosomes isolated from mouse serum, we show that levels of miRNAs
change after BAT activation in vitro and in vivo. One of these exosomal miRNAs,
miR-92a, is also present in human serum exosomes. Importantly, serum concentrations of
exosomal miR-92a inversely correlate with human BATactivity measured by 18F-FDG PET/CT
in two unique and independent cohorts comprising 41 healthy individuals. Thus, exosomal
miR-92a represents a potential serum biomarker for BAT activity in mice and humans.

 B
rown adipose tissue (BAT) is a specialized fat depot that
dissipates energy to generate heat1–4. BAT was thought
to be active only in rodents and human infants5, but
recently metabolically active BAT was also found in adult
humans5. The activity and amount of BAT is usually analysed
by
18F-FDG PET/CT imaging6–9. However, this technique
requires cold activation of BAT and exposes patients to
ionizing radiation.
Activation of BAT is mainly controlled by the sympathetic
nervous system1,3. Sympathetic nerves release norepinephrine
(NE) and co-transmitters10 that activate G protein-coupled
receptors and induce production of cyclic AMP (cAMP) which
in turn activates protein kinase A and lipolysis1.
Apart from ‘classical’ brown adipocytes, inducible brown
adipocytes with thermogenic potential—also known as beige or
brite (brown-like-in-white) adipocytes—have been identified in
white adipose tissue (WAT)3,4,11,12. ‘Browning’ of WAT, that is,
increasing the number of beige/brite adipocytes, can be induced
by a large spectrum of substances and stimuli including
cold-exposure and NE treatment, as well as adenosine10 and
cyclic GMP2. The metabolically active fat depots in the neck and
supraclavicular region of human adults contain both constitutive
brown and inducible beige adipocytes13–15 with deeper neck
depots possessing classical brown characteristics and more
superficial depots expressing beige markers16. Thermogenesis
mediated by both brown and beige/brite adipocytes is dependent
on
the
action
of
the
uncoupling
protein
1
(UCP-1)17,
which
uncouples
mitochondrial
ATP
production
and
is
stimulated by fatty acids that are liberated by lipolysis1.
Although the major focus of BAT research has been on
pathways that regulate UCP-1-mediated energy expenditure to
identify potential BAT-centred therapies, diagnostic tools that
allow for safe and easy assessment of BAT in humans are lacking.
miRNAs are small non-coding RNAs, which regulate protein
expression in a broad range of tissues18–20. miRNAs play an
important role in BAT21 and several miRNAs have been
identified that control brown adipocyte differentiation including
miR-106b and miR-93 (ref. 22), miR-133 (ref. 23), miR-378
(ref. 24) and miR155 (ref. 25). miRNAs also regulate browning
of white adipocyte and thus the number of mature beige
adipocytes25,26. Interestingly, BAT activation itself, for example,
by cold-exposure is able to change miRNA expression patterns of
brown adipocytes23.
Exosomes are small lipid vesicles 40–100 nm in size27 that
contain RNAs (mRNA and miRNAs), as well as proteins
and surface molecules28. Exosome secretion from releasing cell
and subsequent uptake of exosomes by a recipient cell provides a
mechanism for cell-to-cell communication and exchange of
material between cells29. The composition of exosomes changes
during cellular differentiation and pathological processes28.
Therefore, exosomes can be involved in pathophysiological
processes and can also be used as biomarkers to assess tissue
function and disease progression30.
To date, there is no biomarker for BAT that can easily be
accessed by blood analysis. Here we show that brown adipocytes
secrete exosomes and that exosomal miRNAs can be used as a
potential serum biomarker for BAT activity in humans and mice.
Results
Brown adipocytes release exosomes. To detect exosomes in
brown adipocytes, we initially expressed a green fluorescent
protein (GFP) fusion protein of the exosome marker CD63
(ref. 31) in murine brown adipocytes (Fig. 1a). Electron micro-
scopy (Fig. 1a) and western blotting revealed the release of exo-
somes from brown adipocytes and BAT (Fig. 1b). Treatment of
brown adipocytes with cAMP, the second messenger that is
induced by cold and b-adrenergic stimulation, resulted in a 4.7-
fold increase of exosomes in the culture medium (Fig. 1c), indi-
cating that cAMP signalling enhances exosome release from
brown adipocytes. To study exosome release also in beige cells, we
treated primary murine white adipocytes with NE, which induced
a significant increase in UCP-1 expression (Supplementary
Fig. 1a). As ‘pure’ white adipocytes, we used 3T3-L1 cells that
did not significantly increase UCP-1 expression after b-adrener-
gic stimulation with NE (Supplementary Fig. 1a). cAMP induced
a significant increase of exosome release in beige (10.7-fold)
adipocytes, but not in 3T3-L1 white adipocytes or in brown pre-
adipocytes (Fig. 1c). The treatment with cAMP also did not sig-
nificantly affect the release of exosomes from muscle cells (C2C12)
or hepatocytes (HepG2) (Fig. 1c). Next we studied the release of
exosomes from tissues after cold-exposure. Exosomal markers
CD63 and Hsp70 were detectable in all isolations (Supplementary
Fig. 1b). Similar to the in vitro data, both BAT and inguinal WAT
(WATi) of mice showed a significant (9.05-fold and 7.62-fold,
respectively) increase in exosome release after cold-exposure
(Fig. 1d). WATi was used for the analysis of beige fat, given its
high capacity for browning after cold-exposure32. In contrast,
gonadal WAT (WATg)—the purest WAT depot33—and other
tissues (that is, muscle, liver and brain) exhibited no significant
changes of exosome release after cold-exposure (Fig. 1d).
Considering the weight of the three adipose tissues (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 1c), 87% of the total amount of exosomes is secreted
from BAT under cold conditions, whereas exosomes from WATi
and WATg make up only 11% and 2%, respectively (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 1d).
Exosomal miRNAs in serum and release from brown adipocytes.
Next, miRNAs were profiled in exosomes isolated from serum of
mice with activated BAT—either exposed to cold or treated with
the b3-adrenoreceptor agonist CL-316,243 (CL)—and compared
with control mice, as well as to miRNAs present in exosomes
released from brown adipocytes treated with and without cAMP.
Based on the expression profiles of the 188 miRNAs that were
detected in treated mice and brown adipocytes (Supplementary
Table 1), respectively, we computed an average linking hierarchical
clustering. The resulting dendrogram (Supplementary Fig. 1e)
shows a higher similarity of in vitro samples to each other
compared with serum samples.
To identify miRNAs associated with BAT activation in vitro and
in vivo, we visualized the overlap of miRNA expression between
the different groups by Venn diagrams (Fig. 2a). Among 757
profiled murine miRNAs, serum levels of 41 miRNAs were altered
by more than twofold in response to CL treatment or cold-
exposure (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Table 1). About 12 and 29
miRNAs were up- and downregulated, respectively, in both in vivo
groups (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Table 1). These miRNA
candidates might represent possible biomarkers for BAT activity.
Therefore, we analysed next the miRNA profile of exosomes
released from brown adipocytes. To induce brown adipocyte
activation in vitro, we used cAMP, the second messenger that is
induced by cold and b-adrenergic stimulation, and compared the
in
vivo
with
the
in
vitro
miRNA
pattern
(Fig.
2a
and
Supplementary Table 1). Seven candidates showed the same trend
in at least two of the investigated groups; and three out of these
seven showed a coherent trend in all three groups, namely miR-
92a, miR-133a and miR-34c* (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2).
Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) revealed that miR-34c*
and
miR-92a
were
significantly
up-
and
downregulated,
respectively,
in
the
exosomes
from
cAMP-treated
brown
adipocytes and from serum of mice with active BAT (Fig. 2b,c).

 Although
miR-133a
was
downregulated
in
serum-derived
exosomes
of
CL-treated
mice,
miR-133a
expression
was
neither significantly altered in brown adipocyte-derived exosomes
nor in any of the mouse models analysed (Fig. 2b,c). Comparison
of the abundance of these miRNAs in exosomes and in
brown adipocytes revealed that miR-92a and miR-34c* were
differentially expressed after cAMP treatment in the exosomes
but not in BA (Supplementary Fig. 2a,b). Although miR-34c* is
differentially expressed during differentiation of murine brown
adipocytes34, miR-34c* was not detectable in human serum
samples (see below). Therefore, we focused in the current
study on miR-92a. Levels of miR-92a in exosomes released
from cAMP-stimulated brown adipocytes were reduced after 4 h
and
a
significant
reduction
was
observed
after
24 h
(Supplementary Fig. 2c). To identify the source of miR-92a in
mice, we quantified the amount of miR-92a in exosomes isolated
from BAT, WATi, WATg, skeletal muscle, liver and brain.
miR-92a was detectable in all tested samples (Fig. 2d). The
highest abundance of miR-92a per exosome was released by
WATi followed by WATg, BAT, liver brain and muscle (Fig. 2d).
Cold-exposure induced a significant downregulation of exosomal
miR-92a in BAT (to 6% of the control) and WATi (to 18%),
but not in exosomes derived from other tissues (Fig. 2d).
Similar changes were observed in vitro (Fig. 2e). In mice, the
increase in BAT mass on prolonged cold-exposure significantly
correlated with the reduction of miR-92a abundance in serum
(Supplementary Fig. 2d,e). Moreover, we studied miR-92a release
in murine obesity. As expected, mice fed a high fat diet (HFD) for
16 weeks showed ‘whitening’ of BAT with a significant increase
in lipid droplet size and triglyceride content (Supplementary
Fig. 2f,g). Whitening of BAT was accompanied with an increased
release of miR-92a from BAT (2.75±0.65-fold) and increased
exosomal
miR-92a
levels
in
serum
(2.66±0.19-fold)
(Supplementary Fig. 2h).
Exosomal miRNAs in human serum. To analyse whether BAT
activity correlates with miRNA in circulating human exosomes,
we investigated serum exosomal miR-92a levels in two cohorts of
subjects that were studied by 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging. Initially,
we focused on a well-characterized, coherent cohort (cohort 1) of
22 lean individuals with a mean age of 21.5±2.3 years and a
mean body mass index (BMI) of 21.3±1.7. These individuals
exhibited considerable differences in BAT activity quantified by
standard uptake values (SUV) and glucose uptake rate (Table 1).
A description of the subject characteristics can be found in
Supplementary Tables 3 and 4. To further substantiate our
findings, we analysed a second cohort (cohort 2) with 19 indi-
viduals (mean age, 36.3±9.6; mean BMI 23.6±2.4) (Table 2 and
Supplementary Table 5).
Exosomal miR-92a in serum reflects brown fat activity. For the
analysis of human exosomal miRNAs, we focused on miR-92a
and miR-133a, whereas miR-34c* was not detectable in human

 serum exosomes. Although miR-92a and miR-133a expression
levels showed considerable inter-individual variation in cohort 1,
their expression was not different between males and females and
was not related to any other parameter such as age, or BMI.
Based on PET/CT data of cohort 1 (Fig. 3a,b), subjects
were initially divided into a ‘low BAT’ (mean SUV (SUV
mean)omedian SUV [2.70]) and ‘high BAT’ (SUVmean4
median SUV [2.70]) group (n ¼ 11 per group; Table 1).
Interestingly, serum exosomal miR-92a abundance was signifi-
cantly lower in the high BAT group compared with the low BAT
group (unpaired, two-tailed t-test, P ¼ 0.017, Fig. 3b), whereas
miR-133a abundance was similar between groups (unpaired, two-
tailed t-test, P ¼ 0.757, Supplementary Fig. 3a). In addition, when
considering the group as a whole, we observed a significant
negative correlation between Log10 miR-92a and the BAT
SUVmean value (Fig. 3c). Such correlation was absent for
miR-133a (Supplementary Fig. 3b). In a stepwise multivariable
linear regression analysis with Log10 miR-92a as a dependent
variable, and age, sex, BMI, fat mass and BAT SUVmean,
SUVmax and glucose uptake rate as independent variables, all
three BAT parameters were significant predictors of Log10
miR-92a (Supplementary Table 6). In addition, individual
univariate analyses showed no relations between other parameters
and Log10 miR-92a. As alternative to BAT SUVmean, we also
assessed BAT SUVmax and glucose uptake rate (Fig. 3d,e). In
both cases, we observed a significant correlation between these
values and the Log10 miR-92a value (SUVmax: Pearson’s
correlation, R2 ¼ 0.28, P ¼ 0.011, glucose uptake rate: Pearson’s
correlation, R2 ¼ 0.26, P ¼ 0.016, n ¼ 22), (Fig. 3d,e, respectively).
Furthermore, to rule out that single axis logarithmic transforma-
tion resulted in such linear correlations, we performed similar
analysis for the Log10 BAT SUVmean � Log10 miR92a (Pearson’s
correlation, R2 ¼ 0.18, Po0.05, n ¼ 22), as well as the Log10 BAT
SUVmax � Log10
miR92a
(Pearson’s
correlation,
R2 ¼ 0.25,
Po0.05,
n ¼ 22),
which
resulted
in
similar
correlations
(Supplementary Fig. 3c,d, respectively).
Ten subjects were subsequently exposed to a 10-day cold
acclimation period, which caused a recruitment of BAT and
an
increase
in
non-shivering
thermogenesis,
as
described
previously35. Interestingly, miR-92a abundance tended to be
lower after this cold acclimation period (19.5±12.9 versus
13.6±12.7) and the change in miR-92a levels tended to be
negatively
related
to
changes
in
BAT
activity
(Pearson’s
correlation, R2 ¼ 0.29, P ¼ 0.11, Fig. 3f) on this cold acclimation
period. In addition, the regression equation obtained in Fig. 3d
correctly predicted whether subjects would either show a large
increase (4change in median SUVmean [ þ 0.43]) or a small
increase/decrease (o change in median SUVmean) in BAT
activity on cold acclimation, based on changes in miR-92a
(Supplementary Table 3). The prediction was correct in 8 out of
10 cases with a considerable variation (confidence intervals 0.44
to 0.97 (exact interval)) (Supplementary Table 3). Interestingly,
two patients in this cohort did not show BAT activity (BAT
SUVmean was 0.37 or 0.45 in these subjects, respectively) along
with high serum level of miR-92a (Fig. 3f, Supplementary
Tables 3 and 4). One individual participating in the cold
acclimation study showed a large decrease in miR-92a after
cold-exposure along with high increase in BAT activity (DBAT
SUVmean ¼ 1.59, Supplementary Table 3).
Moreover, we analysed miR-92a levels in serum exosomes in
subjects (in 15 out of the 22 subjects blood samples were
available; Supplementary Tables 3 and 4) that were acutely
exposed to cold (ca. 1–1.5 h). Serum Log10 miR-92a levels of
these acute cold-exposed subjects also tended to inversely
correlate with BAT SUVmean (Pearson’s correlation, R2 ¼ 0.21,
P ¼ 0.08,
n ¼ 15,
Supplementary
Fig.
3e).
No
blood
was
withdrawn from seven patients due to vasoconstriction in cold
(Supplementary Tables 3 and 4).
To verify the observed correlation of exosomal miR-92a with
BAT activity, we investigated cohort 2 (19 individuals) with a
wider range of BMI (from 18.9 to 28.9) and age (from 21 to 51)
that were also analysed by
18FDG-PET/CT (Supplementary
Table 5). The correlation analysis of Log10 miR-92a as a
dependent
variable,
and
age,
sex,
BMI,
fat
mass
and
glucose uptake rate as independent variables identified glucose
uptake rate as only significant predictor of Log10 miR-92a
(Supplementary
Table
7).
Interestingly,
exosomal
miR-92a
abundance was significantly higher in individuals that were
BAT negative compared with those with detectable BAT tissue
(Fig. 3g). Similar to cohort 1, we observed a correlation between
Log10 miR-92a and BAT activity (glucose uptake rate) (Pearson’s
correlation,
R2 ¼ 0.40,
P ¼ 0.004,
n ¼ 19)
(Fig.
3h).
Taken
together, exosomal miR-92a is an indicator of human BAT
activity in the investigated two cohorts.
Discussion
BAT has received a lot of interest after the discovery of
metabolically active adipose depots in the neck and supraclavicular
region of adults that take up glucose after cold stimulation6–9. In
addition to its metabolic function, BAT is also a source of
signalling molecules that can modulate BAT function or even other
tissues like the liver36,37. These BAT-derived signals include nitric
oxide38,39 and adenosine10 that activate brown adipocytes in a
paracrine/autocrine manner, as well as endocrine factors and
hormones like FGF21 (refs 40,41) and NRG4 (ref. 42). In this
study, we demonstrate that brown adipocytes release exosomes
that contain miRNAs and that exosome release, as well as the
exosomal miRNA pattern change after brown adipocyte activation.
Exosomes are found in various body fluids including blood and
play a role in exchanging information between cells and tissues29.
Several studies have shown that exosomes can regulate the
function
of
the
recipient/target
cell
and
miRNAs
are
considered as major exosomal signals and effectors29. For
example,
exosome-mediated
transfer
of
cancer-secreted
miR-105 has been shown to reduce endothelial barrier function;

 thereby promoting metastasis43. Furthermore, tumour-secreted
exosomal miRNAs can trigger a pro-metastatic inflammatory
response via binding to Toll-like receptors44.
The pattern of exosomal miRNAs differ between healthy
individuals and patients, as well as in different stages of
diseases, therefore, exosomal miRNAs can be used as biomarkers
of disease states and tissue function29,45. The power of exosomal
miRNAs as diagnostic tools has been clearly demonstrated
for cancer46. Moreover, recent studies identified circulating
miRNAs
as
potential
biomarkers/indicators
of
metabolic
disorders including obesity (miR-152 (ref. 47), miR-17 (ref. 47),
miR-138
(refs
47,48),
miR-15b
(ref.
48)
and
miR-376a
(ref. 48)) and type 2 diabetes (miR-593 (ref. 48) and miR-15a
(ref. 49), miR-503 (ref. 48), miR-326 and let-7a/f (ref. 50)).
Yet, we are the first to relate exosomal miR-92a serum levels with
BAT activity in humans.
The miR-17-92 (miR-17, miR-18a, miR-19a, miR-20a, miR-
19b-1 and miR-92a) cluster was previously described to be
regulated by cell cycle via E2F3 binding and by a negative
feedback loop through miR-17 that targets E2F2 (ref. 51). The
miR-17-92 cluster is essential for development52 and genetic
deletion of this cluster results in defects in heart and lung
development leading to postnatal death53. Dysregulation of
several cluster members has been observed in most cancer
types52 leading to its classification as ‘oncomiR-1’-cluster54. miR-
92a has been associated with leukaemia, breast cancer and
hepatocellular carcinoma55–57. Although miR-92 has been shown
to impair angiogenesis58 and to promote atherosclerosis59,60,
ablation of this miRNA in mice resulted only in bone defects61.
While
six
(miR-17,
miR-18a,
miR-19a,
miR-20a
and
miR-19b-1) of the seven members of this cluster were investigated
in the context of adipocyte differentiation62, little is known about

 the role of miR-92a in adipocytes. First in vivo investigations
associate
genetic
knockout
and
pharmacological
inhibition
of miR-92a with a HFD-resistant, more healthy phenotype
in mice63.
The detection of BAT currently relies mainly on PET/CT
imaging of 18F-FDG uptake into metabolically active BAT. This
imaging technique was originally developed—and is still mainly
used—for detection of metastasis in oncology. Coincidentally,
18F-FDG PET/CT imaging revealed the increased uptake of tracer
in a region extending from the anterior neck to the thorax64.
Several seminal publications6–9,16 showed that these areas of
cold-induced glucose uptake correspond to BAT. However,
the major drawback of this technique is the exposure of
patients to ionizing radiation by both the FDG tracer and
CT and thus cannot be used for screening purposes or large
number of subjects. In addition, this method only visualizes active
BAT and consequently has an imminent need to expose subjects
to cold.
Thus, diagnostic markers of BAT are of great importance to
study the physiological role of human BAT, as well as for clinical
trials to stratify subjects and to quantify the effects of drug
candidates on BAT. In this regard, the relation between exosomal
miR-92a abundance in human blood samples and cold-induced
BAT activity is highly promising. However, the correlation is very
modest and future studies with larger cohorts are needed, since
biomarkers typically need to classify with greater accuracy than
an R2 of 0.40 would allow.
Taken together, miR-92a represents a potential thermoneutral
brown/beige
fat
biomarker
for
basic
science
and
clinical
applications, which can be measured with relative ease in large
cohorts of patients.
Methods
Study approval. The human studies were approved by the ethics committee of
Maastricht University Medical Centre and Ethics Committee of Hospital District of
Southwest Finland. All subjects provided written informed consent before any
study procedures.
All procedures were conducted according to the principles of the Declaration
of Helsinki. All animal experiments were approved by the Animal Welfare Officers
of University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) and Beho
¨rde fu
¨r
Gesundheit und Verbraucherschutz Hamburg and the Landesamt fu
¨r Natur,
Umwelt und Verbraucherschutz Nordrhein-Westfalen.
Statistics. Values are presented as means±s.e.m. or means±s.d. for subject
characteristics. Statistical differences were determined using Student’s t-test
(unpaired, two-tailed). GraphPad Prism 5 or Excel software was used to calculate
P values; the level of statistical significance was set at *Po0.05. For human serum
samples, statistical analyses were performed with SPSS Statistics 20.0 for MAC
(IBM, Amonk, NY).
Human serum miR-92a and miR-133a expression levels were not normally
distributed in cohort 1 according to Shapiro–Wilk test (P ¼ 0.000 and P ¼ 0.001,
respectively). Therefore, these data were Log10 transformed, which resulted in
normal distribution (Shapiro–Wilk test, P ¼ 0.626 and P ¼ 0.180, respectively), and
analysed accordingly. Two-sided independent sample t-tests were used to compare
miRNA expressions between groups. Pearson correlations were used to identify
correlations between variables.
Animals. C57BL/6J wild-type mice were purchased from Charles River
Laboratories. Cold-exposure was performed by housing 12-week-old male mice at
4 �C for 7 days. The b3-adrenergic agonist CL-316,243 (#1499, Tocris, Wiesbaden,
GER, 0.2 mg ml � 1 in 0.9 w/v% NaCl) was administered by s.c. injection (1 mg g � 1
body weight) for 7 days. Control-treated C57BL/6J mice received vehicle injections
(0.9% NaCl) correspondingly. Blood collections were performed after 4 h fasting.
Mice were anesthetized with a mix containing ketamin (25 mg ml � 1), xylazin
(0.2%) in 0.9% NaCl and blood was withdrawn transcardially.
For the HFD study, C57BL/6J male mice were purchased from Charles River
Laboratories and fed either a HFD (EF acc. D12492 (II) mod., ssniff, Soest, GER) or
a normal chow diet (R/M-H; maintenance feed catalogue page 14, ssniff) for 16
weeks starting at the age of 8 weeks. For triglyceride measurements, tissue was
weighed and transferred to TGx lysis buffer (150 mM NaCl, 0.05% Triton X-100,
10 mM Tris-HCl and 4% cOmplete (11873580001, Roche, Basel, SUI)). Tissue was
chopped with scissors and grinded manually with a pestle. Triglyceride reagent
(T2449-10ML, Sigma Aldrich, St Louis, MO) was added according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. The increase in absorbance at 540 nm is directly
proportional to the free glycerol concentration of the sample. The calculated TG
content was normalized to the total BAT weight.
miRNA profiling. qPCRs of exosome-derived miRNAs were performed with
TaqMan Rodent MicroRNA Array card A and card B (#4444909, Life Technolo-
gies, Carlsbad, CA). Mouse serum samples were pooled (three mice per group) and
two pools were analysed per condition (cold, CL or wild type); for the analysis of
brown adipocyte-derived exosomes, the supernatant of six wells from a six-well
plate was pooled from cells treated with 200 mM 8-Bromoadenosine 30,50-cAMP
(cAMP) and untreated control cells. Data were analysed with software RQ man-
ager1.2.1 and DataAssistv3.01 (Life Technologies).
Exosomal miRNAs that were deregulated more than twofold (compared with
vehicle-injected mice) after CL-316,243-treatment or cold-exposure, as well as
those miRNAs up- or downregulated twofold after cAMP treatment (as compared
with control cells) were considered for the Venn diagram analyses. Selected
candidates were validated with TaqMan miRNA assay kit according to the
manufacturer’s instruction. MicroRNA Assay miR-92 (cat no. 000430, Life
Technologies) was used to quantify miR-92a located on chromosome 14:
115044427-115044506 [ þ ] with the following sequence: 30-UAUUGCACUUG
UCCCGGCCUG-50. U6 snRNA (TaqMan MicroRNA Assays U6 snRNA

located on chromosome 9: 51103034-51103110 [ � ] with the sequence:
30-AAUCACUAACCACACAGCCAGG-50. MicroRNA Assay miR-133a-3p
(cat no. 478511, Life Technologies) was used to quantify miR-133a located on
chromosome 18: 19405659-19405746 [ � ] with the sequence 30-UUUGGUCC
CCUUCAACCAGCUG-50.
Cell culture. Interscapular brown pre-adipocytes were isolated from newborn
C57BL/6J mouse pups (both sexes) and differentiated in vitro with hormonal
cocktail as previously described25. In detail: 80,000 cells were seeded per well on a
6-well plate and cultivated in growth medium (DMEM without pyruvate, 10% FBS,
1% P/S) until 90% confluent. The cells were pretreated with differentiation medium
for 2 days containing DMEM with pyruvate 10% FBS, 1% P/S, T3 1 nM, insulin
20 nM followed by induction of differentiation for 2 days with DMEM with
pyruvate 10% FBS, 1% P/S, T3 1 nM, insulin 20 nM, 500 mM IBMX and 1 mM
dexamethasone. The cells were kept in differentiation medium for another 6 days
until fully differentiated. Isolation and cultivation of primary white adipocytes was
performed as described25. In short: 200,000 primary cells were seeded per well of a
6-well plate and grown in growth medium (DMEM with pyruvate, 10% FBS, 1%
P/S) until fully confluent. The cells were induced for 2 days (DMEM with pyruvate,
5% FBS, 1% P/S, 172 nM insulin, 0.25 mM dexamethasone, 0.5 mM IBMX, 1 nM T3,
1 mM rosiglitazone and ABP (50 mg ml � 1 L-Ascorbat;1 mM d-Biotin; 17 mM
Panthothenate)). The cells were kept in differentiation medium (DMEM with
pyruvate, 5% FBS, 1% P/S, 172 nM insulin, 1 nM T3 and ABP) for 10 days. After
full differentiation, on day 12 browning was induced with 1 mM NE (A7257, Sigma
Aldrich) for 12 h and compared with untreated controls. 3T3-L1 (American Type
Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) were cultured as previously described65. About
200,000 cells were seeded per well of a 6-well plate and grown in growth medium
(DMEM with pyruvate, 10% FBS, 1% P/S) until fully confluent. Induction was
carried out with DMEM with pyruvate, 10% FBS, 1% P/S, 172 nM insulin, 500 mM
IBMX and 1 mM dexamethasone. The cells were maintained in differentiation
medium (DMEM with pyruvate, 10% FBS, 1% P/S, 172 nM insulin). HepG2
(HB-8065, ATCC, Teddington, UK) were cultured in growth medium (DMEM
with pyruvate 10% FBS, 1% P/S) until fully confluent. C2C12 myocytes (CRL-1772,
ATCC) were fully differentiated as follows: 120,000 cells were seeded per well in
DMEM with pyruvate 10% FBS, 1% P/S until confluent then cultured for 7 days in
DMEM without pyruvate, 2% Horse Serum, 1% P/S and 1% non-essential amino
acids solution (NEAA, cat no. 11140-050, Life Technologies). Medium for all cells
was changed every second day. All cells were kept in DMEM with 2% Exo-FBS
(#FBSHI-250A-1, System Biosciences, Mountain View, CA) 1% P/S for 48 h either
with or without 200 mM cAMP to release exosomes. The supernatant was
withdrawn and used for exosome isolation.
Exosome isolation. C57BL/6J wild-type mice were purchased from Charles River
Laboratories. Cold exposure was performed by housing 8-week-old male mice at
18 �C for 7 days followed by 4 �C for 7 days. Blood was withdrawn transcardially
after 4 h fasting and subsequently sacrificing the mice. Organs (brain, liver,
BAT, WATi, WATg and the soleus muscle) were obtained, washed in ice cold PBS
and weighed. Tissues were incubated in 2 ml medium (DMEM with 2%
Exo-FBS (#FBSHI-250A-1) 1% P/S) and chopped with scissors. The chopped tissue
was centrifuged at 1,000g for 5 min at room temperature and re-dissolved in
medium and incubated for 30 min at 37 �C, 5% CO2. After another medium
exchange, the tissues were incubated for 2 h at 37 �C, 5% CO2 to release exosomes.

 The supernatant was then withdrawn and used for exosome isolation. The
exosomal samples used for qPCR and ELISA were adjusted to 1.65 mg and 16.5 mg
tissue, respectively, to compare exosome/miR-92a release from various tissues.
Isolation of exosome either from BA, BAT or serum was performed using exosome
precipitation kit according to the manufacturer’s instruction (#4478359 or
#4478360, Life Technologies)
Exosomal RNAs were isolated according to the manufacturer’s instruction
(#4478545, Life Technologies). CD63 quantification was done with an ELISA kit
according to the manufacturer’s instructions (#EXOEL-CD63A-1, System
Biosciences).
Western blotting. Proteins from exosomes, cells and tissues were extracted with
RIPA-lysis buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P40, 0.25%
Na-deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) containing complete protease inhibitor cocktail (see
above), 1 mM Na3VO4 and 10 mM NaF. Western blotting was performed with
anti-CD63 (1:1,000), anti-Hsp70 (1:1,000) and anti-CytoC (1:1,000) antibodies that
were purchased from System Biosciences (#EXOAB-KIT-1-SBI) or Santa Cruz
(#sc-7159, Heidelberg, GER). Anti-a-Tubulin (1:1,000) antibody was purchased
from Upstate (#DLN-09993, Lake Placid, NY) and served as a loading control.
Full immunoblots are displayed in Supplementary Fig. 4a–c.
Electron microscopy and CD63 tracing. The exosomes were incubated with 3.5%
uranyl acetate and visualized with a Philips CM10 electron microscope
(Philips, Amsterdam, NL). Primary brown adipocytes were transfected with
lentiviral particles overexpressing copGFP with a CD63 fusion to track CD63.
The cells were differentiated as described above. The tracer kit was purchased from
System Biosciences (pCT-CD63–GFP), and used according to the manufacturer’s
manual. The construct encodes a fusion protein consisting of an organelle-specific
signalling peptide and the copGFP fusion with CD63. The organelle-specific
signalling peptide directs the copGFP to the appropriate subcellular location.
The GFP protein was visualized by excitation at 482 nm and detection at 502 nm
with a Leica DMIRE2 Fluorescent Microscope.
Subjects. miRNA expression levels were determined in thermoneutral blood
samples from 2 independent cohorts; cohort 1 comprises 22 randomly selected
young, healthy subjects (Table 1) from 2 previously published studies, in which
cold-stimulated BAT activity was measured as described previously35,66. Briefly,
BAT activity from static PET scans was measured as mean and maximal 18F-FDG
uptake in BAT, expressed as SUV: 18F-FDG uptake (kBq ml � 1) per (injected dose
(kBq) per patient weight (g)). The investigated regions were manually outlined,
using a threshold of 1.5 SUV and Hounsfield units between � 10 and � 180 to
define BAT67. When supraclavicular fat tissue activity did not exceed the threshold
of 1.5 SUV, fixed volumes of interest were used to quantify tissue activity68.
BAT SUVmean represents average glucose uptake in all upper body BAT depots.
In addition, glucose uptake rates were calculated from dynamic PET data and
evaluated with a Patlak curve fitting and a lumped constant of 1.14 (ref. 35).
In total, 22 blood samples were withdrawn at thermoneutrality (Fig. 3b–e) and 15
after mild cold activation for 1–1.5 h (Supplementary Fig. 3e) were used to access
exosomal miR-92a levels (Supplementary Tables 3 and 4).
Ten subjects were additionally exposed to a 10-day cold acclimation protocol35,
after which thermoneutral miRNA serum levels were reassessed (Fig. 3f,
Supplementary Table 3).
Cohort 2 consists of 19 subjects69,70 (Table 2). In short, scanning and data
acquisition was carried out dynamically, producing tissue time activity curves in
BAT. Further, image-derived input function was derived from aortic arch because
especially during cold scans blood samples were difficult to obtain. Gjedde–Patlak
model was used in graphical analysis, and fractional uptake of 18F-FDG was further
multiplied with the plasma glucose concentration (mmol l � 1) to calculate the
glucose uptake rate in BAT. The subjects in cohort 2 were sorted for BAT positivity
based either on the biopsy finding or on the comparison of warm and cold PET
scans (in subjects who did not consent for biopsy). If there was more than threefold
higher uptake in cold than warm, subjects were BAT positive69,70. For image
analysis, the investigated regions were manually and semi-automatically outlined,
using double thresholding (both CT Hounsfield units and PET radioactivity are
utilized). All subject characteristics are displayed in Supplementary Tables 3–5.
