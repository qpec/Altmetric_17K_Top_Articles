 During the last quarter of the 20th century recreational use of
cannabis increased greatly across the world.1 Cannabis consump-
tion came to be seen as a normal leisure activity, and was regarded
as safe even by the medical establishment.2 However, in recent
years there has been considerable controversy over the use of
cannabis, with, for example, the UK government repeatedly
reviewing its safety.3 This concern has arisen from large prospec-
tive epidemiological studies which have reported that use of
cannabis increases the risk of schizophrenia-like psychosis.4,5
However, these studies have not collected detailed data on the
patterns of use or potency of the cannabis used, which may be
important factors moderating the associated risk.6
The principal constituents of cannabis are D9-tetrahydro-
cannabinol (D9-THC) and cannabidiol. The former is the main
psychoactive ingredient and in experimental studies it produces
transient psychotic symptoms and impaired memory in a dose-
dependent manner.6,7 In contrast, cannabidiol does not induce
hallucinations or delusions, and it seems to antagonise the cogni-
tive impairment and psychotogenic effects caused by D9-THC.6
Until the early 2000s the most freely available type of cannabis
in the UK was cannabis resin (‘hash’), which had approximately
70% of the ‘street’ market, followed by traditional imported herbal
cannabis and then sinsemilla (‘skunk’). Cannabis resin contains
2–4% D9-THC and a similar proportion of cannabidiol, whereas
herbal cannabis contains a similar percentage of D9-THC but no
cannabidiol.8,9 However, sinsemilla (skunk) has increasingly taken
over the UK market and its THC concentration, and to a lesser
extent that of imported herbal cannabis, has been consistently
rising. For example, seizures of cannabis on the streets of England
in 2008 by the police showed that sinsemilla had a market share
of more than 70%, and had reached a D9-THC concentration of
12–18% with virtually no cannabidiol.8,9
Smith has suggested that such high-potency cannabis might be
especially harmful to mental health.10 We therefore compared
patterns and types of cannabis use in people experiencing their
first episode of psychosis and in a healthy control sample.
Specifically, we sought to test the hypothesis that daily use of
high-potency cannabis is associated with a particularly high risk
of psychosis.
Method
Sample
We approached all patients aged 18–65 years who presented with a
first episode of psychosis to the Lambeth, Southwark and Croydon
adult in-patient units of the South London & Maudsley Mental
Health National Health Service (NHS) Foundation Trust between
December 2005 and October 2008. We validated clinical diagnosis
by administering the Schedules for Clinical Assessment in
Neuropsychiatry (SCAN).11 Patients who met ICD–10 criteria
for a diagnosis of psychosis (codes F20–F29 and F30–F33)12 were
invited to participate in the study; cases with a diagnosis of
organic psychosis were excluded. During the same period we
recruited a healthy control group (n = 174) from the local
population living in the area served by the Trust, by means of
internet and newspaper advertisements, and distribution of
leaflets at train stations, shops and job centres. Cannabis was
not mentioned in these advertisements. Particular attention was
directed to attempting to obtain a control sample similar to the
patient sample in age, gender, ethnicity, educational qualifications
and employment status. Those who agreed to participate were
administered
the
Psychosis
Screening
Questionnaire,13
and
excluded if they met criteria for a psychotic disorder or reported
a previous diagnosis of psychotic illness.
Ethical permission was obtained from the Trust and the
Institute of Psychiatry research ethics committee. All study
participants signed a consent form allowing publication of data
originating from the study.

Background
People who use cannabis have an increased risk of
psychosis, an effect attributed to the active ingredient D9-
tetrahydrocannabinol (D9-THC). There has recently been
concern over an increase in the concentration of D9-THC in
the cannabis available in many countries.
Aims
To investigate whether people with a first episode of
psychosis were particularly likely to use high-potency
cannabis.
Method
We collected information on cannabis use from 280 cases
presenting with a first episode of psychosis to the South
London & Maudsley National Health Service (NHS) Foundation
Trust, and from 174 healthy controls recruited from the local
population.
Results
There was no significant difference between cases and
controls in whether they had ever taken cannabis, or age at
first use. However, those in the cases group were more
likely to be current daily users (OR = 6.4) and to have smoked
cannabis for more than 5 years (OR = 2.1). Among those who
used cannabis, 78% of the cases group used high-potency
cannabis (sinsemilla, ‘skunk’) compared with 37% of the
control group (OR 6.8).
Conclusions
The finding that people with a first episode of psychosis had
smoked higher-potency cannabis, for longer and with greater
frequency, than a healthy control group is consistent with
the hypothesis that D9-THC is the active ingredient
increasing risk of psychosis. This has important public health
implications, given the increased availability and use of high-
potency cannabis.

 Assessment
We collected sociodemographic data (age, gender, self-rated
ethnicity, level of education achieved and employment status)
on both cases and controls. All participants were asked about their
use of illicit drugs and those who reported ever using cannabis
were interviewed using the Cannabis Experience Questionnaire.14
This allows a detailed assessment of lifetime patterns of cannabis
and stimulant use, including age at first use, frequency and
duration of use, and the specific type of cannabis used.
Statistical analysis
Logistic regression was used to analyse the relationships between
various aspects of cannabis use (lifetime use, age at first use,
duration and frequency of use, and cannabis potency) and case–
control status, and to test for interaction effects while controlling
for potential confounders. Associations are expressed as odds
ratios.
Results
We found 340 patients with first-episode psychosis who met our
inclusion criteria. Of these patients 60 (17.6%) refused to
participate, leaving 280 cases to be included in our analyses. Most
common reasons for refusal included lack of interest in research
and the length of our study assessment. If patients initially refused
because they were too ill, we approached them again later in case
their refusal was simply due to the severity of their symptoms.
During the same period we recruited 174 individuals to the
control group. There was no significant difference between the
cases and control groups in age, gender, ethnicity, educational
qualifications or employment status at time of assessment
(Table 1).
Lifetime cannabis use
More than half of the cases group (57%, n= 159) had used
cannabis at least once in their life (Table 2), compared with 109
controls (63%) (OR = 0.8, 95% CI 0.6–1.5). Among those who
had ever used cannabis, 65% (n = 183) of the cases group had first
tried cannabis before the age of 17 years, compared with 52%
(n = 91) of the control group (adjusted OR = 1.1, 95% CI 0.8–3.4).
Patterns of cannabis use
Among those who used cannabis, 59% (n = 94) of the cases group
had used it for more than 5 years compared with 38% (n = 41) of
controls (unadjusted OR = 2.4, 95% CI 1.2–4.7). When potential
confounders (age, gender, ethnicity, level of education achieved
and employment status) were adjusted for, this difference was
attenuated slightly (adjusted OR = 2.1, 95% CI 0.9–8.4) and no
longer reached statistical significance. However, those in the cases
group were around six times more likely than the control group to
use cannabis every day, even after adjusting for the above potential
confounders (cases 77% v. controls 33%; unadjusted OR = 6.7,
95% CI 2.0–11.5, adjusted OR = 6.4, 95% CI 3.2–28.6).
Type of cannabis used
Again considering only those who used cannabis, 78% (n = 125) of
the cases group preferentially used sinsemilla (skunk) compared
with only 31% (n = 41) of the control group (unadjusted
OR = 8.1, 95% CI 4.6–13.5). This association was only slightly
attenuated after controlling for potential confounders (adjusted
OR = 6.8, 95% CI 2.6–25.4).
Combined effects of frequency and type of cannabis
use
There was some evidence of an interaction between frequency and
type of cannabis use: among those who used cannabis, those who
used sinsemilla (skunk) less frequently (not every day) were
around 5 times more likely to be in the cases group (OR = 5.7,
95% CI 2.5–12.6), whereas those who used it daily were around
12 times more likely to be in the cases group (OR = 12.1, 95%
CI 3.7–37.3; Mantel–Haenszel test for homogeneity of odds
ratios: w2 = 1.2, P= 0.5). The variation in odds ratios was
non-significant, and we consequently did not fit an interaction
term to our final logistic regression model. However, this lack of
significance may be due to limited statistical power, and given that
the difference is in the expected direction (i.e. highest odds in
those who used sinsemilla/skunk daily), the finding remains
noteworthy and certainly merits further investigation.
Discussion
Patients experiencing a first episode of psychosis were not more
likely to have ever taken cannabis or to have started doing so
earlier than the control group. This is not surprising because
cannabis consumption is very common among adolescents in
the UK: 40% of British children aged 15–16 years have used
cannabis.1 However, psychosis was associated with more frequent
and longer use of cannabis. This confirms previous suggestions

 Di Forti et al
that the risks of both transient psychotic symptoms and
schizophrenia in those who use cannabis are dose-related.6
Our most striking finding is that patients with a first episode
of psychosis preferentially used high-potency cannabis prepara-
tions of the sinsemilla (skunk) variety. In south-east London this
form of cannabis is estimated to contain between 12% and 18%
D9-THC and less than 1.5% cannabidiol. In contrast, those in
the control group who used cannabis were more likely to consume
resin (hash), with an average D9-THC concentration of 3.4% and
a similar proportion of cannabidiol.9
It is not surprising that the higher concentration of D9-THC
in sinsemilla (skunk) is more likely to have detrimental effects
on mental health. An experimental study in normal humans of
the acute effects of intravenous administration of D9-THC found
that the resulting psychotic symptoms were dose-dependent.7
Furthermore, a positron emission tomographic study has shown
that inhalation of D9-THC acutely increases striatal dopamine,15
which is thought to underlie psychotic symptoms.16
The relative lack of cannabidiol in sinsemilla (skunk) may also
be relevant, as there is some evidence that cannabidiol has anti-
psychotic properties.17 Furthermore, Curran et al measured
cannabinoid traces in the hair of three groups of normal
volunteers, and found that those with D9-THC only had higher
levels of schizophrenia-like symptoms than the ‘D9-THC plus
cannabidiol’ and ‘no cannabinoid’ groups.18
The availability of skunk on the UK market has steadily
increased over the past 6 years.8 Our estimate of preferred type
of cannabis used refers not to current use but lifetime use. In fact,
we did ask our participants to indicate among a list of types of
cannabis the one they preferentially smoked at any time during
their period of use. Most of those in the cases group (65%) and
control group (52%) had started using cannabis before age 17,
on average 6 years ago, and had continued to use it for 5 years.
Given that participants in the control group who used cannabis
had been exposed to the same changes in the cannabis market
as those from the cases group, the increased availability of skunk
cannot alone explain why our control group members are less
likely to prefer higher-potency types than the cases group across
time.
Finally, our results suggest that the potency and frequency of
cannabis use may interact in further increasing the risk of psychosis.
Limitations and strengths
Our findings need to be considered in the light of potential
limitations. In theory, it is possible that our use of non-random
strategies of control recruitment could have biased our findings.
However, the cases and control groups were similar on a number
of sociodemographic factors that are associated with cannabis use
(e.g. education) and there was no evidence that our approach
undersampled those who used cannabis. Indeed, the proportion
of controls who had ever used cannabis (62%) was higher than
the national average (47%) for similar age groups,19 reflecting
the fact that cannabis use is more common in south-east London
than in the UK as a whole. Alternatively, if our sampling strategy
resulted in oversampling those who used cannabis, this would
have had the effect of reducing the strength of the associations
we observed – that is, our findings would underestimate the effects
of different patterns of cannabis use on the risk of schizophrenia.
Is it possible that our control recruitment strategy biased our
sample towards one of mild cannabis users, excluding heavy users
perhaps more likely to use skunk? Our advertising strategy
included internet and local newspapers advertisements as well as
distribution of leaflets at local shops, job centres and community
centres. There is no evidence that such methods of advertising are
more likely to bias towards better-functioning and socially
adjusted individuals; indeed, the opposite might be the case. It
therefore seems unlikely that the striking difference in type of
cannabis used between the cases and control groups is driven by
a recruitment bias. Moreover, there was no reported evidence of
skunk dependence in the clinical record of cases recruited.
We cannot totally exclude the possibility that patients in a
prodromal phase might need higher concentrations of D9-THC.
However, a recent population study has shown that cannabis
use in adolescence is associated with a twofold increase in
prodromal symptoms even when controlling for several con-
founders, including behavioural symptoms.20 We also know from
experimental studies that D9-THC is the active ingredient in
inducing psychotic symptoms and that cannabidiol produces
beneficial effects, including possible amelioration of psychotic
symptoms and reduced anxiety.7,17 Therefore, it remains unclear
why
those
already
experiencing
prodomal
and/or
psychotic
symptoms should choose to use a cannabis type (sinsemilla) with high
levels of D9-THC which is likely to exacerbate their symptoms, rather
than one that contains as much cannabidiol as D9-THC (resin).
Finally, we did not have a biological measure of the type of
cannabis used, such as urine, blood or hair samples. These
methods allow one to test only for recent use, and would not have
helped to confirm the type of cannabis used over past years.
Moreover, participants in our first-episode psychosis group were
in-patients at time of recruitment, and such biological tests could
have produced false results for those tested more than 4 weeks
after admission to hospital. A biological measure would therefore
not have helped to enhance our findings.

 High-potency cannabis and psychosis
Study implications
It is generally accepted that drinking a glass of light wine every day
is less likely to be associated with serious health consequences than
drinking a daily bottle of whisky or vodka. Unfortunately,
previous studies of the association between cannabis use and
psychosis have not collected detailed information on the patterns
of use, or potency, of the cannabis smoked. Our findings are the
first to suggest that the risk of psychosis is much greater among
people who are frequent cannabis users, and among those using
sinsemilla (skunk) rather than occasional users of traditional hash.
It is not surprising that those who use skunk daily seem to be the
group with the highest risk of all.
Unfortunately, sinsemilla (skunk) is displacing traditional
cannabis preparations in many countries. Public education about
the risks of heavy use of high-potency cannabis is vital.
