ABSTRACT
Objective: The early diagnosis of (pre)diabetes
mellitus is essential for the prevention of diabetes
complications. It has been suggested that gum disease
(periodontitis) might be an early complication of
diabetes and may be a useful risk indicator for diabetes
screening. Therefore, a dental office could be a good
location for screening for (pre)diabetes in patients with
periodontitis using a validated glycated hemoglobin
(HbA1c) dry spot analysis.
Research design and methods: A total of 313
individuals from a university dental clinic participated.
From 126 patients with mild/moderate periodontitis, 78
patients with severe periodontitis and 109 subjects
without periodontitis, HbA1c values were obtained by
the analysis of dry blood spots. Differences in mean
HbA1c values and the prevalence of (pre)diabetes
between the groups were analyzed.
Results: The mild/moderate and severe periodontitis
groups showed significantly higher HbA1c values
(6.1%±1.4% (43 mmol/mol±15 mmol/mol) and 6.3%
±1.3% (45 mmol/mol±15 mmol/mol), respectively)
compared with the control group (5.7%±0.7%
(39 mmol/mol±8 mmol/mol), p=0.003). In addition,
according to the American Diabetes Association (ADA)
guidelines for diagnosis, there was a significant over-
representation of subjects with suspected diabetes
(23% and 14%) and pre-diabetes (47% and 46%) in
the severe periodontitis group and mild/moderate
periodontitis groups, respectively, compared with the
control group (10% and 37%, p=0.010). Notably,
18.1% of patients with suspected new diabetes were
found among subjects with severe periodontitis
compared with 9.9% and 8.5% among subjects with
mild/moderate periodontitis and controls, respectively
(p=0.024).
Conclusions: The dental office, with particular focus
on patients with severe periodontitis, proved to be a
suitable location for screening for (pre)diabetes; a
considerable number of suspected new diabetes cases
were identified. The early diagnosis and treatment of
(pre)diabetes help to prevent more severe
complications and benefit the treatment of
periodontitis.
INTRODUCTION
Diabetes
mellitus
is
a
growing
health
problem and its prevalence is dramatically
increasing.1 The prevalence of diabetes was
estimated at 285 million adults worldwide in
20102 and this is expected to rise to 552
million by 2030.3 However, owing to the
absence of symptoms and/or disease-related
knowledge, diabetes often goes undetected,
and approximately one-third of people with
diabetes are not aware of their status.4 5 The
early diagnosis and intervention of (pre)dia-
betes prevent the common microvascular
and macrovascular complications6 and are
cost-effective.7 Therefore, risk indicators for
(pre)diabetes screening are needed and pro-
posed.8 In this respect, the onset of several
oral pathologies might be indicative of meta-
bolic dysregulation.
Several studies demonstrate the association
between diabetes and oral diseases. The most
commonly observed chronic oral disease is
periodontitis.
Periodontitis
is
a
common
chronic multifactorial inflammatory disease
of the supporting structures of the teeth
(root cementum, gingiva, periodontal liga-
ment, and alveolar bone), initiated and sus-
tained by an aberrant host immune response
Significance of the study
What is already known about this subject?
The early diagnosis of (pre)diabetes mellitus is
essential for the prevention of diabetes complica-
tions. Periodontitis may be a first sign of diabetes
type 2.
What are the new findings?
On average, patients with periodontitis showed
higher glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) plasma levels
compared with individuals without periodontitis.
Among
the
subjects
with
severe
periodontitis
whose metabolic status was unknown, 18% of sus-
pected new diabetes cases were identified.
How might these results change the focus
of research or clinical practice?
Here, we show that periodontitis is an early sign of
diabetes mellitus and may therefore serve as a valu-
able risk indicator. A dental office that treats
patients with periodontitis is a suitable location for
screening for diabetes by a simple finger stick and
validated HbA1c dry spot analysis.

 against resident bacterial biofilm on the teeth. It is a
major cause of tooth loss.9 The severe form of this con-
dition occurs in ∼10–15% of the population, and the
prevalence is twice as high in subjects >50 years of
age.10–12 Many studies have demonstrated that diabetes
mellitus severely exacerbates the onset, progression, and
severity of periodontitis.13–16 The prevalence of peri-
odontitis in patients with diabetes is estimated to be two
or even three times higher than in an otherwise healthy
population.17 In addition, periodontitis is strongly asso-
ciated with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus.18 19 This is
because subjects with diabetes, particularly subjects with
uncontrolled diabetes, are more susceptible to infections
and impaired wound healing;20 therefore, periodontitis
is considered to be a complication of diabetes melli-
tus.14 21 22 With this knowledge, it has been suggested
that dentists could help screen for (pre)diabetes.23 24
The majority of dental practices are not equipped for
blood
biochemistry.
The
measurements
of
glycated
hemoglobin (HbA1c) using dry blood spots may be a
conservative way to screen for diabetes in patients with
periodontitis.
The aim of the present study was to determine HbA1c
levels and affirm the presence of (pre)diabetes in sub-
jects from a university dental clinic with and without
periodontitis using the analysis of dry blood spots. Since
periodontitis can be considered a complication of (pre)
diabetes, we suggest the hypothesis that patients with
periodontitis show an increased prevalence of (pre)dia-
betes
compared
with
subjects
without
periodontal
disease.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
Study population
A consecutive series of patients with periodontitis who
were referred to the Department of Periodontology of
the Academic Centre for Dentistry Amsterdam (ACTA)
for the diagnosis and treatment of periodontitis were
enrolled in this study. Controls were selected among sub-
jects registered for restorative dental procedures or those
who visited the dental school for regular dental check-
ups. The selection period was between February 2014
and September 2015. A total of 313 subjects, including 78
patients with severe periodontitis, 126 patients with mild/
moderate periodontitis, and 109 controls, were included
in this study. Briefly, referred patients with periodontitis
were recruited during their first visit to the periodontal
clinic. Probing pocket depth (PPD) measurements and
gingival recession (GR), if present, were recorded at six
sites per tooth and dental radiographs were available to
analyze interproximal alveolar bone levels. For those sites
where the GR was recorded, the clinical attachment loss
(CAL) could be determined (PPD+GR). Patients were
classified as suffering
from periodontitis
using
the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention—American
Academy of Periodontology (CDC-AAP) case defin-
ition:25 mild periodontitis was defined as two or more
interproximal sites with CAL≥3 mm and two or more
interproximal sites with PPD≥4 mm (not on the same
tooth) or one site with PPD≥5 mm. Moderate periodon-
titis was defined as two or more interproximal sites with
CAL≥4 mm (not on the same tooth) or two or more
interproximal sites with PPD≥5 mm (not on the same
tooth).25 Patients who showed at least two interproximal
sites with CAL≥6 mm on different teeth in conjunction
with at least one interproximal site with PPD≥5 mm were
classified as suffering from severe periodontitis.25 All
patients were untreated and showed generalized bleeding
on probing. Control subjects were included if they did
not fulfill any of the aforementioned criteria for case def-
inition. In addition, these subjects showed no interproxi-
mal alveolar bone loss on ≤1-year-old dental bitewing
radiographs. Subjects with an age of <18 years were
excluded from the study. No other exclusion criteria were
used.
All participants received verbal and written informa-
tion about the purpose of the study and provided
informed consent. The Medical Ethical Committee of
the VU University Medical Center approved the study.
Background and diabetes-related characteristics
For
all
participants,
general
and
diabetes-related
characteristics were recorded with the help of a ques-
tionnaire and medical history (Hx). The recorded
characteristics were from the questionnaire: sex, age,
ethnicity (origin of parents), education level, smoking
habits, relatives with diabetes mellitus and a history of
periodontal treatment; from the Hx: diagnosis of hyper-
tension, hypercholesterolaemia, and diabetes mellitus.
Height and weight were measured in our clinic to deter-
mine the body mass index (BMI).
Blood collection and HbA1c analysis
After a finger-stick, two drops of capillary blood were
spotted on a Whatman 903 paper collection card (GE
Healthcare Life Sciences, Eindhoven, Netherlands). The
collection cards were stored at 4°C and sent weekly by
regular postal mail to the Clinical Chemistry Laboratory of
the Medical Center (MC) Slotervaart, Amsterdam, the
Netherlands. Two 6 mm punches were incubated in
400 μL hemolysis buffer of the standard HbA1c test, which
was measured immunoturbidimetrically on an Abbott
ci8200 clinical chemistry analyzer (Abbott Laboratories,
Abbott
Park,
Illinois,
USA).26
The
finger-stick
and
Whatman paper collection method was previously vali-
dated against the conventional EDTA blood collection by
venipuncture according to the Clinical and Laboratory
Standards Institute (CLSI) EP9 method comparison proto-
col. Precision and stability studies of HbA1c on Whatman
903 collection cards have been reported27 and showed
that the finger-stick collection card and punch method for
HbA1c determination was highly correlated with the stand-
ard EDTA blood collection method (regression analysis
r=0.99; see online supplementary figure S1). To further
determine the validity of the finger-stick method in the

 current study population, 10 patients were selected for
both the finger-stick analysis and the standard EDTA
venous blood collection method. A similar correlation in
HbA1c between these two methods was obtained (r=0.99,
data not shown).
Statistical analyses
Sample size was determined based on a pilot study,
including 49 periodontally healthy subjects and 33
patients with periodontitis. We detected a mean differ-
ence in the HbA1c of 0.7% (7 mmol/mol) between
patients with periodontitis and control subjects, which
we considered clinically relevant. The calculation of
sample size (http://powerandsamplesize.com) was based
on a two-sided Student’s t-test of 5% with 80% power
and using the mean of HbA1c of both groups (control:
5.5%
(37 mmol/mol)
and
periodontitis:
6.2%
(44 mmol/mol)) and an overall study population-based
SD of 1.3% (15 mmol/mol). The required sample size
was a minimum of 61 subjects per group.
Data were analyzed with SPSS 23.0.0.2 (IBM SPSS,
Chicago, Illinois, USA). The means, SDs, medians, total
range,
and
frequency
distributions
were
calculated.
According to the American Diabetes Association (ADA)
guidelines,8 HbA1c values were classified as normal
(<5.7% (<39 mmol/mol)), pre-diabetes (5.7–6.4% (39–
47 mmol/mol)),
or
diabetes
mellitus
(≥6.5%
(≥48 mmol/mol)). The general and diabetes-related
characteristics of the study population, HbA1c levels,
and (pre)diabetes prevalence within the study popula-
tion
were
compared
with
parametric
and
non-
parametric tests (analysis of variance (ANOVA) and χ2
test). Where applicable, analyses were corrected for mul-
tiple testing (Bonferroni). For all analyses, the signifi-
cance level was set to p<0.05.
RESULTS
Study population
In this study, a total of 313 consecutive subjects (109
controls,
126
patients
with
mild/moderate
and
78
patients
with
severe
periodontitis)
were
included.
Demographic and diabetes-related characteristics of the
study population are presented in table 1. The mean
ages for the control, mild/moderate, and severe peri-
odontitis groups were 48.4, 51.1, and 50.5 years, respect-
ively (p=0.200). Overall differences in sex distribution
between the groups were significant (p=0.010), with
more males in the severe group (62% compared with
40% in the mild/moderate periodontitis group and 47%
in the control group). In addition, more subjects from
the control group were in the highest education cat-
egory
compared
with
the
periodontitis
groups
(p=0.007). Among patients with periodontitis, there
were more current smokers (mild/moderate periodon-
titis: 23.0% and severe periodontitis: 37.2%), while this
rate was 9.2% among controls (p<0.001).
The BMI was significantly higher in patients with peri-
odontitis (≥27 kg/m2) than in controls (24.9 kg/m2),
and more patients in the periodontitis group could be
classified
as
being
overweight
(BMI≥25 kg/m2;
p=0.008). No significant differences could be observed
between the three groups regarding the number of sub-
jects reporting hypertension and hypercholesterolaemia,
while patients with more mild/moderate periodontitis
reported relatives with diabetes mellitus. The number of
individuals with self-reported diabetes mellitus was not
significantly different between the controls and patients
with periodontitis (2.8% for controls, 4.0% for mild/
moderate periodontitis, and 7.7% for severe periodon-
titis, p=0.256, table 2).
Patients with periodontitis
had significantly fewer
teeth than controls (p<0.001), and the severe periodon-
titis group had more teeth with ≥50% alveolar bone loss
than the mild/moderate periodontitis group (median: 8
and 1, respectively). Controls had no alveolar bone loss.
HbA1c analysis
The mean HbA1c values for the study groups are pre-
sented in table 2. With an increasing severity of peri-
odontitis, a significant increase in HbA1c levels could be
observed (p=0.003). On average, the mean HbA1c in
the severe periodontitis group was 6.3% (45 mmol/
mol), in the mild/moderate periodontitis group, 6.1%
(43 mmol/mol), and in the controls, 5.7% (39 mmol/
mol). Subsequently, we tabulated the number of subjects
with suspected diabetes and pre-diabetes based on levels
of HbA1c using the ADA guidelines.8 There was a sig-
nificant over-representation of subjects with suspected
diabetes (23% and 14%) and pre-diabetes (47% and
46%) in the severe periodontitis group and mild/mod-
erate periodontitis groups, respectively, compared with
the control group (10% and 37%, table 2).
The
ADA
HbA1c
cut-off
for
diabetes
(6.5%,
(48 mmol/mol)) might explain the relatively high preva-
lence of suspected diabetes in the control group (10%)
compared with the estimated overall prevalence of dia-
betes in the Netherlands (5%).28 Since a threshold of
HbA1c of 7% (53 mmol/mol) has been proposed to
exclude possible false-positive measurements,29
30 the
prevalence
of
study
subjects
with
HbA1c≥7%
(≥53 mmol/mol) was determined: control, 3.7%; mild/
moderate periodontitis, 7.1%; and severe periodontitis,
12.8% (p=0.061).
To further explore the potential role of periodontitis
as a risk indicator for diabetes and its contribution to
diabetes screening, we determined the percentage of
patients
without
an
Hx
of
diabetes
that
had
an
HbA1c≥6.5% (≥48 mmol/mol, new diabetes). In all
groups,
patients
with
suspected
new
diabetes
were
found, and this number increased with increasing sever-
ity of periodontitis (control: 8.5%, mild/moderate peri-
odontitis:
9.9%,
and
severe
periodontitis:
18.1%,
p=0.024, table 2).

 CONCLUSIONS
In this study, we aimed to evaluate HbA1c values in sub-
jects without and with periodontitis to establish the
prevalence of (pre)diabetes, as periodontitis has been
considered a complication of (pre)diabetes.14 This study
used a validated finger-stick test for HbA1c with the
advantage of a chairside test and the accuracy of the
standard immunoturbidimetric assessment of HbA1c on
a clinical analyzer applying the new ADA guidelines for
the diagnosis of diabetes.8 Therefore, this method is
very useful for the screening of (pre)diabetes in a
dental office setting. The idea of diabetes screening in
the dental office has been suggested by several other
research groups, although their reports may have had
different aims and techniques among themselves.23 31–34
The early identification of subjects at high risk for (pre)
diabetes mellitus or with undiagnosed diabetes mellitus
is crucial to implement measures that may prevent or
delay progression from pre-diabetes to overt diabetes
mellitus and reduce the incidence of chronic complica-
tions.35 For example, the results of a 20-year follow-up
study showed that early prevention strategies, such as
lifestyle intervention, resulted in a reduction in diabetes
mellitus onset and consequently, it was associated with a
47% reduction in the incidence of threatening retinop-
athy.36 Recently, a 23-year follow-up of the latter study
showed that early lifestyle intervention was associated
with a decrease in the cumulative incidence of cardiovas-
cular and all-cause mortality.37 Current ADA recommen-
dations for the management of (pre)diabetes reflect
these observations and risk indicators for (pre)diabetes
screening are needed and proposed.8 Notably, among
subjects with severe periodontitis, we found that more
than 18% of the subjects, who were unaware of the pres-
ence of diabetes, had HbA1c values exceeding the 6.5%
(48 mmol/mol) threshold. This proportion is almost
two times greater than those observed for patients with
mild/moderate periodontitis (9.9%) and for subjects
without periodontitis (8.5%). This confirms the assump-
tion that severe periodontitis could be an early sign of
undiagnosed diabetes. In this respect, the presence of
severe periodontitis might be indicative of metabolic dys-
regulation and by the identification of diabetes, treat-
ment of this disease can be initiated, which is also
relevant for the successful treatment of periodontitis. We
expect that a good collaboration between dentists and
diabetologists will lead to the best treatment results.
One recent study used a point-of-care (POC) HbA1c
assessment by means of a finger-stick blood sample but
employed a benchtop analyzer.38 Although this test
obtains rapid results, the accuracy compared with values
obtained by the standard assessment of HbA1c is ques-
tionable.39 In contrast, our finger-stick and Whatman
paper collection method and the standard immunotur-
bidimetric assessment of HbA1c on an Abbott ci8200
clinical chemistry analyzer26 showed a very high correl-
ation with the venipuncture collection method and sub-
sequent HbA1c measurement (r=0.99). Despite a less
accurate HbA1c determination, the results of the recent
study38
corroborate
our
findings that
a
substantial
number of patients with suspected new diabetes in the
periodontitis group can be found. A higher frequency of
patients with suspected new diabetes in the periodontitis
group in our study can be explained by the higher accur-
acy of our method for HbA1c determination and a clear
case definition for subjects without or with mild/moder-
ate or severe periodontitis. Notably, subjects with severe
periodontitis showed a high frequency of suspected new
diabetes cases, and the applied ADA case definition may
therefore be very useful in general practice. In our study,
compared with the recent publication,38 the control and
periodontitis groups were comparable regarding age
and ethnic origin; these factors have been considered
important for diabetes screening.8
The prevalence of suspected diabetes in the control
group (10.1%) in this study, as measured by HbA1c, is
high compared with the overall estimated prevalence in
the Netherlands (5.45%).28 An obvious explanation could
be that our study population, derived from a dental
school, is not representative of the Dutch population.
Another reason might be that the national prevalence is
actually an underestimation; since diabetes is often asymp-
tomatic in its early stages, it may remain undiagnosed for
many years.40 In addition, it is possible that the current
use of HbA1c levels results in a higher prevalence com-
pared with the prevalence based on the traditional param-
eter plasma glucose levels, such as fasting plasma glucose
levels and/or the oral glucose tolerance test. The recently
adopted diagnosis of diabetes by HbA1c has been pro-
posed by the ADA,8 and the advantages and disadvantages
for HbA1c as a diagnostic marker have been extensively
discussed in the literature.30 41–45 However, most of the
studies show that even the use of HbA1c levels may result
in
an
underestimation
of
diabetes
prevalence.
Nevertheless, a
higher cut-off
of
HbA1c
of
≥7.0%
(≥53 mmol/mol, instead of ≥6.5% (≥48 mmol/mol)) has
been proposed to exclude a possible false-positive diagno-
sis.29 30 When applying this threshold, the prevalence of
subjects with HbA1c levels of ≥7.0% (≥53 mmol/mol) in
the control group was 3.7%, and this can be considered to
be in agreement with the overall estimated prevalence of
diabetes in the Netherlands. Nevertheless, applying the
threshold ≥7% (≥53 mmol/mol), the prevalence of sub-
jects with diabetes was clearly higher in those with mild/
moderate periodontitis (7.1%) and with severe periodon-
titis (12.8%). Interestingly, the results show that half of the
subjects classified as having diabetes, using a threshold of
≥6.5% (≥48 mmol/mol), do have HbA1c levels in the
range of 6.5–7% (48–53 mmol/mol), confirming that
periodontitis is a useful risk indicator for the screening of
early diabetes. The early diagnosis and intervention of
(pre)diabetes prevent the common microvascular and
macrovascular complications6 and are cost-effective.7 In
addition, it can be suggested that the early diagnosis and
treatment of (pre)diabetes may also benefit the treatment
of periodontitis.

 A dental office that treats patients with severe peri-
odontitis is a suitable location for screening for (pre)
diabetes; a considerable number of suspected new dia-
betes cases were identified and indicated that periodon-
titis is an early sign of diabetes mellitus.
