 Zika virus is causally linked with congenital microcephaly 
and may be associated with pregnancy loss. However, the 
mechanisms of Zika virus intrauterine transmission, replica-
tion, and tropism and persistence in tissues are poorly un-
derstood. We tested tissues from 52 case-patients: 8 infants 
with microcephaly who died and 44 women suspected of 
being infected with Zika virus during pregnancy. By reverse 
transcription PCR, tissues from 32 (62%) case-patients 
(brains from 8 infants with microcephaly and placental/fetal 
tissues from 24 women) were positive for Zika virus. In situ 
hybridization localized replicative Zika virus RNA in brains 
of 7 infants and in placentas of 9 women who had pregnan-
cy losses during the first or second trimester. These findings 
demonstrate that Zika virus replicates and persists in fetal 
brains and placentas, providing direct evidence of its asso-
ciation with microcephaly. Tissue-based reverse transcrip-
tion PCR extends the time frame of Zika virus detection in 
congenital and pregnancy-associated infections.
Z
ika virus has recently caused global concern because of 
an unprecedented outbreak of infection in Brazil and 
its association with congenital microcephaly and other ad-
verse pregnancy outcomes, including pregnancy loss (1–4). 
Vertical transmission of Zika virus from infected mothers 
to fetuses has been reported (5–7). However, the mecha-
nism of intrauterine transmission of Zika virus, cellular tar-
gets of viral replication, and the pathogenesis that leads to 
microcephaly and other congenital malformations have not 
yet been completely elucidated.
Recent in vitro studies that used brain organoids, neu-
rospheres, and human pluripotent stem cell–derived brain 
cells have demonstrated Zika virus infection of human 
neural stem and progenitor cells and have also shown that 
placental macrophages are permissive to Zika virus infec-
tion (8–13). Several studies that used mouse models have 
revealed that Zika virus infection of mice during early 
pregnancy results in infection of placenta and fetal brain, 
causing intrauterine growth restrictions, spontaneous abor-
tions, and fetal demise (14–16). Animal models and in vitro 
studies, although providing valuable insights, might not ex-
actly reflect Zika virus disease processes in humans (9,17). 
We previously detected Zika virus antigens in placentas 
of women and in human fetal or neonatal brains (18,19). 
However, the presence of antigens does not necessarily 
indicate virus replication. Previous case studies have de-
tected Zika virus RNA by reverse transcription PCR (RT-
PCR) in fetal or neonatal brains, in amniotic fluid, and in 
placentas of women who had acquired Zika virus infection 
during early pregnancy (5,20–22). Nevertheless, localiza-
tion of replicating Zika virus RNA directly in the tissues 
of patients with congenital and pregnancy-associated infec-
tions is critical for identifying cellular targets of Zika virus 
infection and virus persistence in various tissues and for 
further investigating the mechanism of Zika virus intrauter-
ine transmission.
Furthermore, laboratory diagnosis of congenital and 
pregnancy-associated Zika virus infections, particular-
ly those involving adverse pregnancy outcomes, is also 
challenging because of the typically short duration of vi-
remia (23,24). Generally, Zika virus RT-PCR can detect 
viral RNA in serum within 3–10 days of symptom onset 
(24,25). Thus, diagnosis by serum RT-PCR can be dif-
ficult for neonates who acquire Zika virus infection in 
utero and for women who acquire (undiagnosed) Zika vi-
rus infection during early pregnancy and later experience 
adverse pregnancy or birth outcomes, because Zika virus 
RNA generally clears from maternal/infant serum by the 
time the infant is born or infection is suspected. Serologic

testing by ELISA, along with plaque-reduction neutraliza-
tion testing, can be useful for these cases but may not al-
ways provide conclusive Zika virus diagnosis for patients 
with previous flavivirus exposure or immunization (23–
25) and cannot characterize the virus strain and genotype. 
As a part of the ongoing Zika virus public health response, 
we developed Zika virus RT-PCR and in situ hybridiza-
tion (ISH) assays for the detection and localization of Zika 
virus RNA in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) 
tissues and tested various tissues from infants with micro-
cephaly who died. We also tested placental/fetal tissues 
from a series of women suspected of being infected with 
Zika virus during various stages of pregnancy.
Methods
Clinical Specimens
As part of an ongoing public health response effort, we test-
ed FFPE tissue specimens from 52 case-patients (8 infants 
with microcephaly who died and 44 women) for whom 
Zika virus infection was clinically and epidemiologically 
suspected. The tissue specimens were submitted during 
December 2015–July 2016 to the Centers for Disease Con-
trol and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Emerging 
and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, Division of High-Con-
sequence Pathogens and Pathology, Infectious Diseases 
Pathology Branch (Atlanta, GA, USA), by local and state 
health departments and pathologists for diagnostic consul-
tation. In this series, the definition of a case-patient was 1) 
a pregnant woman with possible Zika virus disease (based 
on >1 of the following symptoms: fever, rash, arthralgia, 
or conjunctivitis and a history of residing in or traveling 
to countries with active Zika virus mosquito-borne trans-
mission) or 2) an infant with clinical and epidemiologic 
evidence of possible Zika virus–associated congenital mi-
crocephaly. Case-patients were from the United States (n 
= 38, including 6 from US territories), Brazil (n = 7), and 
Colombia (n = 7). Tested specimens were placenta, um-
bilical cord, fetal tissues (from pregnancy loss) from 44 
women suspected of being infected with Zika virus during 
pregnancy, and different portions of the brain (including 
cerebral cortex, pons, medulla), kidney, liver, spleen, lung, 
and heart from 8 infants with microcephaly who died. We 
also included in this analysis all available clinical, demo-
graphic, and travel history information and other relevant 
laboratory results from the state and local health depart-
ments and the CDC National Center for Emerging and 
Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, Division of Vector-borne 
Diseases, Arboviral Diseases Branch (including available 
serology and serum RT-PCR results). Clinical status of the 
infant, including determination of microcephaly or appar-
ently healthy status, was based on the information (gen-
erally including anthropometric measurements, physical 
examination, hearing test and imaging findings) provided 
to CDC by the state and local health departments and re-
ferring clinicians or pathologists as of date of testing. All 
samples and associated medical and autopsy records were 
provided in the context of diagnostic consultation, a rou-
tine public health service provided by CDC. As such, insti-
tutional review was not required for the testing described 
in this article. Clinical and pathologic findings for 5 cases 
from Brazil have been previously described (18,19).
RNA Extraction, RT-PCR, and Sequencing
We designed 2 sets of primers that target the nonstructural 
5 (NS5) and envelope (E) genes of Zika virus and devel-
oped RT-PCR assays for the detection of Zika virus RNA 
from FFPE tissues. We validated the RT-PCR assays by 
using various positive and negative controls. Positive con-
trols were RNA extracted from FFPE blocks of cultured 
cells infected with Zika virus prototype (MR766, 1947) and 
Brazil 2015 strains. Negative controls were RNA extracted 
from FFPE cell culture controls or tissue specimens from 
persons with previously confirmed infection with the fol-
lowing viruses: dengue types 1–4, West Nile, yellow fever, 
Japanese encephalitis, St. Louis encephalitis, eastern and 
western equine encephalitis, chikungunya, herpes, parvovi-
rus B19, cytomegalovirus, adenovirus, enterovirus, rubella, 
Powassan, and Lacrosse. We extracted RNA from FFPE 
tissues of all 52 case-patients (multiple FFPE tissue blocks 
per patient) by using an optimized extraction protocol as 
previously described (26) and tested the samples by newly 
developed Zika virus NS5 and E-gene RT-PCR and by RT-
PCR for dengue and chikungunya viruses (27,28). RT-PCR 
assays were performed by using a QIAGEN OneStep RT-
PCR Kit (Valencia, CA, USA) and 5 µl of RNA template, 
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The thermo-
cycling conditions used for Zika virus NS5 gene RT-PCR 
were as follows: 1 cycle at 50°C for 30 min; 1 cycle at 95°C 
for 15 min; then 40 cycles of incubation at 94°C, 56°C, and 
72°C for 1 min each; followed by 1 cycle of final exten-
sion at 72°C for 10 min. The primer sequences, annealing 
temperatures, and amplification product sizes of the RT-
PCRs are summarized in Table 1. The NS5 (127-bp) and E 
(209-bp) gene–positive amplicons were directly sequenced 
on a GenomeLab GeXP Genetic Analysis System (AB 
SCIEX, LLC, Redwood City, CA, USA). The search for 
homologies to known sequences was performed by using 
the BLAST nucleotide database (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.
gov/Blast.cgi). To evaluate the level of fragmentation and 
presence of PCR inhibitors, we also tested each sample by 
housekeeping gene 18S rRNA RT-PCR by using Quant-
umRNA Classic 18S Internal Standard (Life Technologies, 
Carlsbad, CA, USA).
To calculate the Zika virus RNA copy number in tissues 
of case-patients positive by conventional RT-PCR, we also 
406

  Zika Virus RNA in Brain and Placental Tissue 
performed a quantitative real-time RT-PCR by using primers 
as described previously (23). The amount of human β-actin 
mRNA in the RNA extracted from each section was also de-
termined and used as an internal reference for normalization. 
The relative copy number of Zika virus RNA was calculated 
by using the β-actin mRNA copy number, estimated at 1,500 
copies/cell, as previously described (29). 
ISH 
Zika virus ISH was performed by using sense and anti-
sense riboprobes that target multiple genes of Zika virus 
(Advanced Cell Diagnostics, Newark, CA, USA). ISH 
was developed and validated on Zika virus–positive cul-
ture cells and on various Zika virus–negative controls, 
including tissues from case-patients or cultures positive 
for dengue virus, West Nile virus, and chikungunya vi-
rus. Riboprobes targeting dengue virus and dapB gene 
(Advanced Cell Diagnostics) were also used as negative 
control probes for ISH. To localize Zika virus genomic 
RNA (using antisense probe) and negative-sense replica-
tive RNA intermediates (using sense probe) in tissues, we 
performed ISH on FFPE brain and placental tissues posi-
tive for Zika virus by RT-PCR, as previously described 
(30). To examine pathologic changes in the tissue, we also 
analyzed tissue sections from all case-patients by routine 
histopathology techniques. To define specific cell types, 
we performed immunohistochemical analysis by using 
antibodies against neuronal nuclei (Abcam, Cambridge, 
MA, USA), glial fibrillary acidic protein (Agilent, Santa 
Clara, CA, USA), and CD163 (Leica Biosystems, Buffalo 
Grove, IL, USA) on serial sections of block positive for 
Zika virus by ISH from selected case-patients, according 
to previously described protocol (19).
Statistical Analyses
Statistical analyses were performed by using Graph-
Pad Prism statistical software, version 6.0a (Graph Pad 
Software Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA). We compared de-
mographic and clinical variables between the 2 groups 
by using the Fisher exact test (2-sided). We used the 
Mann–Whitney U test for 2-group comparisons of con-
tinuous data. Differences were considered statistically 
significant at p<0.05.
Results
Case-Patients Characteristics
We identified Zika virus RNA by RT-PCR in various tissue 
specimens from 32 (62%) case-patients (Table 2). Median 
maternal age (age of pregnant women and mothers of in-
fants) was 27 years (range 15–39 years) for case-patients 
with positive Zika virus RT-PCR results and 29 years

(18–43 years) for case-patients with negative Zika virus 
RT-PCR results; all case-patients had Zika virus infec-
tion–like symptoms. For the 32 case-patients with positive 
Zika virus RT-PCR results, the commonly reported signs 
were rash (94%), fever (59%), arthralgia (28%), headache 
(19%), and conjunctivitis (13%). For the 20 case-patients 
with negative Zika virus RT-PCR results, the most com-
monly reported signs were rash (80%), fever (45%), arthral-
gia (40%), headache (20%), and conjunctivitis (20%). No 
distinctive maternal clinical features between case-patients 
positive and negative for Zika virus by tissue RT-PCR 
were identified. Maternal symptom onset occurred during 
the first trimester for 27 (52%) case-patients and during the 
second or third trimester of pregnancy for 24 (46%) (Table 
2). Information about timing of symptom onset was not 
available for 1 case-patient. Of 52 case-patients, 30 (58%) 
had an adverse pregnancy or birth outcome and 22 (42%) 
had live-born, apparently healthy, infants (Table 2). 
RT-PCR and Sequencing 
Brain and placental tissues from 32 (62%) of the 52 case-
patients were positive by both Zika virus RT-PCR assays 
(gene targets NS5 and E). Sequence analysis of all positive 
amplicons showed 99%–100% nt identities with Zika virus 
Asian genotype strains currently (2015–2016) circulating 
in Brazil. RT-PCR results were positive for 24 (75%) of 32 
case-patients with adverse pregnancy (n = 12) or birth (n = 
12) outcomes and positive for 8 (36%) of 22 case-patients 
with live-born, apparently healthy, infants (p = 0.0082). Of 
24 case-patients with positive RT-PCR results and adverse 
pregnancy/birth outcomes, 23 had maternal symptom onset 
during the first trimester, whereas all 8 case-patients with 
apparently healthy infants and positive RT-PCR results had 
symptom onset in the third trimester (p<0.0001).

  Zika Virus RNA in Brain and Placental Tissue 
were women who had live-born infants with microcephaly 
and nonfatal outcome. Of these, 12 (92%) were positive for 
Zika virus by tissue RT-PCR. Zika virus RNA was detected 
by RT-PCR in brain tissues of all 8 infants; all had maternal 
symptom onset during the first trimester. Other tested tis-
sues from infants (kidney, liver, spleen, heart, and rib) were 
negative by RT-PCR. Of the 17 case-patients with adverse 
pregnancy outcomes (Table 4), Zika virus RNA was detect-
ed by RT-PCR in placentas/umbilical cord/fetal tissues of 
12 (70%); all had symptom onset during the first trimester. 
Of 22 case-patients who had live-born, apparently healthy, 
infants, including 8 case-patients with positive RT-PCR re-
sults, 21 (95%) had symptom onset during the second or 
third trimester.
The time frame from maternal symptom onset to de-
tection of Zika virus RNA by RT-PCR in brains was 119–
238 (mean 163) days and in placentas was 15–210 (mean 
81) days. Relative levels of Zika virus RNA in the infant 
brain tissues (Figure 1) were ≈1,200-fold higher than those 
in the second or third trimester or full-term placentas (brain 
geometric mean 651.9 [95% CI 63.91–6,650] copies/cell; 
second or third trimester or full-term placentas geomet-
ric mean 0.5129 [95% CI 0.1649–1.595] copies/cell). 
 
In addition, relative levels of Zika virus RNA in the first 
trimester placentas (13.10 [1.718–99.87] copies/cell) were 
25-fold higher than those in the second or third trimester 
or full-term placentas.
ISH 
Overall, Zika virus RNA was demonstrated by ISH in tis-
sues of 16 (50%) of 32 case-patients with positive Zika vi-
rus RT-PCR results. Intense signals from antisense (which 
binds to Zika virus genomic RNA) and sense (which binds 
to replicative RNA intermediates) probes were observed in 
brain tissues (Figure 2) of 7 of 8 infants with microcephaly. 
Zika virus replicative RNA, detected by using sense probe, 
was observed in the neural cells, neurons, and degenerative 
glial cells within the cerebral cortex of the brain (Figure 
2). Immunostaining with antineuronal nuclei and antiglial 
fibrillary acidic protein was also noted in the areas of ISH 
staining (Figure 2). Zika virus genomic and replicative 
RNA was also localized in placental chorionic villi (Figure 
3) of 9 (75%) of 12 women with positive Zika virus RT-
PCR results who had an adverse pregnancy outcome dur-
ing the first or second trimester. All 9 of these women had 
symptom onset during the first trimester of pregnancy. Zika 
virus replicative RNA was predominately observed in the 
Hofbauer cells of the placental chorionic villi, as identified

by immunohistochemistry studies with CD163 cell marker 
(Figure 3). For 6 of 8 women positive for Zika virus by 
RT-PCR and who had apparently healthy infants, placental 
tissues were available for ISH testing and were all negative. 
Zika virus–positive culture cells and tissues from case-pa-
tients positive for Zika virus showed no signal when tested 
by using dengue virus and DapB probes. 
Discussion
This work demonstrates evidence of Zika virus RNA rep-
lication in placentas of women who had pregnancy losses 
during the first or second trimester of pregnancy and in 
brain tissues of infants with microcephaly. We directly lo-
calized Zika virus negative-sense replicative intermediates 
in Hofbauer cells of placenta and neural cells and neurons 
by using ISH. Our findings indicate that Hofbauer cells 
may play a role in the dissemination or transfer of Zika 
virus to the fetal brain, particularly during early pregnancy. 
Furthermore, tissue-based RT-PCR assays described herein 
also extends the time frame for Zika virus detection; thus, 
the assays can be a valuable adjunct for the diagnosis of 
congenital and pregnancy-associated infections. The assays 
can help to expand diagnostic opportunities for Zika virus, 
particularly when the mother was not previously tested, 
the window of detection for serum RT-PCR and serology 
has passed, or results of Zika virus testing are inconclusive 
(e.g., serology consistent with recent flavivirus infection). 
In addition, our findings also reveal the persistence of Zika 
virus RNA in placenta and brain tissues, which might pro-
vide insights into the potential late or long-term sequelae 
of the infection.
In this series of case-patients, Zika virus clearly ex-
hibited neurotropism. In 7 of 8 infants with microcephaly, 
the presence of Zika virus genomic and replicative RNA 
was observed in neural cells, neurons, and degenerating 
glial cells of cerebral cortex by ISH; whereas, all other 
tested tissues from these case-patients were negative by 
RT-PCR and ISH. Thus, our findings support those of pre-
vious in vitro and mouse studies, which demonstrated that 
Zika virus infects human neural stem and progenitor cells 
and causes severe pathologic changes in the brain but not 
in other visceral organs (8–11,16). A recent study also re-
ported higher expression of Zika virus entry receptor AXL 
in radial glia (the neural stem cells of the human fetal cere-
bral cortex), astrocytes, and neural progenitors (31). Fur-
thermore, we noted that the relative levels of Zika virus 
RNA in the brain tissues of infants were >1,000-fold higher 
than those in placentas, according to real-time quantitative 
RT-PCR, which also suggests replication of Zika virus in 
brain. Previous case reports also describe identification of 
Zika virus antigens and RNA predominately in fetal brain 
tissues by IHC and RT-PCR (6,18–21). We also noticed 
that in all microcephaly cases that were positive by tis-
sue RT-PCR, maternal symptom onset occurred during the 
first trimester, which might suggest that the virus can cause 
abnormal brain development when infection occurs early 
in organogenesis. Previous studies of rubella reported that 
the risk for fetal infection with congenital anomalies is 
highest when exposure/infection occurred before 11–12 
weeks of gestation and sharply decreased with increasing 
gestational age (32).
Findings also demonstrate detection of Zika virus RNA 
by RT-PCR in 12 (86%) of 14 women who had spontaneous 
abortions or fetal losses. All of these women had symptom 
onset during the first trimester. For 9 of these 12 case-patients 
(all with pregnancy losses at <19 weeks gestational age), 
replicative Zika virus RNA was demonstrated in Hofbauer 
cells (placental macrophages) of chorionic villi, suggesting 
direct infection and replication of Zika virus in Hofbauer 
cells. We have previously reported the presence of tropho-
blast necrosis and fibrin deposit along with viral antigens in 
placenta, which may also indicate placental damage by di-
rect infection (33). A recent in vitro study also demonstrated 
that Zika virus infects and primarily replicates in Hofbauer 
cells (13). Prior studies have also identified macrophages as 
target cells for dissemination of dengue virus (34). Taken 
together, these findings suggest that Hofbauer cells, which

placental tissues. The scatter plot graph shows the relative levels 
of Zika virus RNA in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue 
sections, which were quantified by real-time quantitative reverse 
transcription PCR by using primer-probe sets for Zika virus 
envelope gene and β-actin mRNA. β-actin mRNA was used as an 
internal reference gene that provided a normalization factor for 
the amount of RNA extracted from a section. The copy number of 
Zika virus RNA per cell was calculated using β-actin mRNA copy 
number, which was estimated to be 1,500 copies/cell. The graph 
shows individual data points and superimposed horizontal lines 
at the geometric mean, and error bars show the 95% CI for that 
geometric mean. p values were calculated with nonparametric 
1-way analysis of variance (Kruskal-Wallis test) followed by 
Dunn multiple comparison tests. The relative Zika virus RNA 
copy numbers for second/third trimester or full-term placentas 
were statistically significantly lower than those for first trimester 
placentas or infant brain tissues.

have access to fetal blood vessels, may facilitate transfer or 
dissemination of the virus to the fetal brain. Of note, in this 
case series, Zika virus RNA was not detected in any of the 
3 women who had intrauterine fetal demise. Conversely, we 
detected Zika virus RNA by RT-PCR in placentas of women 
who had live-born infants with nonfatal microcephaly; how-
ever, viral load in the placentas was low. This finding may 
indicate temporal persistence of Zika virus RNA in placental 
tissues. Persistence of other viruses in immune-privileged 
organs (e.g., eyes, placenta, fetal brain) has been reported 
(35,36). Previous studies related to other arboviruses, includ-
ing West Nile and chikungunya viruses, have also reported 
persistence of arbovirus RNA in various tissues according to 
RT-PCR (37–39).
Zika virus RNA (low copy number) was also detected 
in placental tissues of 8 women who had apparently healthy 
infants. In each of these women, symptom onset began dur-
ing the third trimester; for 5 of them, serologic evidence of 
Zika virus or unspecified flavivirus infection was found. 
However, in these apparently healthy infants, serum/cord 
blood RT-PCR or serology results were negative for Zika 
virus or flavivirus. Detection of Zika virus RNA in the pla-
centa by RT-PCR cannot distinguish between maternal and 
fetal infection. The absence of apparent abnormalities in

these infants could be because 1) Zika virus may not have 
transferred from the mother to the fetus in utero because 
the late-pregnancy placenta might have protected the fe-
tus, or an effective fetal immune response might be pres-
ent; or 2) the critical period of organogenesis was complete 
before maternal or possibly fetal infection; therefore, no 
apparent/major malformations were identified at the time 
of birth. Clinical implications for an infant with Zika virus 
RNA detected in the placenta, in the absence of laboratory 
evidence of Zika virus in the infant, are unknown. How-
ever, the negative Zika virus testing results (cord blood or 
serum RT-PCR and serology) in these infants should be 
interpreted with caution because the results could be nega-
tive because the window of Zika virus detection might 
have passed. Periodic monitoring of these infants may be 
 
helpful for early recognition of potential late sequelae of

congenital infections. Two recent studies observed neuro-
logic abnormalities in infants whose mothers acquired Zika 
virus infection in the third trimester of pregnancy; for 1 of 
these infants, neurologic abnormalities were first identified 
at 6 months of age (7,40).
In conclusion, our findings further support the link-
age of Zika virus with microcephaly, suggest its associa-
tion with adverse pregnancy outcomes, and demonstrate 
evidence of Zika virus replication and persistence in fetal 
brain and placenta. This article highlights the value of tissue 
analysis to expand opportunities to diagnose Zika virus con-
genital and pregnancy-associated infections and to enhance 
the understanding of mechanism of Zika virus intrauterine 
transmission and pathogenesis. In addition, the tissue-based 
RT-PCRs extend the time frame for Zika virus detection 
and particularly help to establish a diagnosis retrospective-
ly, enabling pregnant women and their healthcare providers 
to identify the cause of severe microcephaly or fetal loss.
