We review epidemiological evidence indicating that most people will develop a diagnosable mental
disorder, suggesting that only a minority experience enduring mental health. This minority has
received little empirical study, leaving the prevalence and predictors of enduring mental health
unknown. We turn to the population-representative Dunedin cohort, followed from birth to midlife,
to compare people never-diagnosed with mental disorder (N � 171; 17% prevalence) to those
diagnosed at 1–2 study waves, the cohort mode (N � 409). Surprisingly, compared to this modal
group, never-diagnosed Study members were not born into unusually well-to-do families, nor did
their enduring mental health follow markedly sound physical health, or unusually high intelligence.
Instead, they tended to have an advantageous temperament/personality style, and negligible family
history of mental disorder. As adults, they report superior educational and occupational attainment,
greater life satisfaction, and higher-quality relationships. Our findings draw attention to “enduring
mental health” as a revealing psychological phenotype and suggest it deserves further study.

 General Scientific Summary
This study reviews evidence indicating that the experience of a diagnosable mental disorder at some
point during the life course is the norm, not the exception. Our results suggest that the comparatively
few individuals who manage to avoid such conditions owe their extraordinary mental health to an
advantageous personality style and lack of family history of disorder, but not to childhood socio-
economic privilege, superior health, or high intelligence.
Keywords: mental health, well-being, psychiatric disorder, epidemiology

This article reports an investigation of individuals who manage
to live for decades without experiencing a mental disorder: the
phenomenon of “enduring mental health.” It has been widely
assumed that individuals who experience mental disorder are rel-
atively rare in the population, and, conversely, that individuals
whose lives remain free from mental disorder are highly prevalent,
commonplace, and therefore unremarkable. This assumption is
reasonable if based on the point-prevalence of mental disorder in
a cross-section of the population at any single point in time.
However, new lifetime data are revealing that individuals who
experience mental disorder are highly prevalent in the population
and as a result of this high lifetime prevalence, individuals whose
lives remain free from mental disorder are, in fact, remarkably few
in number. Within the past decade, estimates from an array of
population-representative samples have converged to suggest that
a diagnosable disturbance in emotional or behavioral functioning
at some point in the life course is near-universal. This novel
observation led us to ask a question missing from the discussion of
mental disorders in contemporary society: If nearly everyone will
eventually develop a diagnosable mental disorder, what accounts
for the distinct minority of individuals who manage to avoid such
conditions?
As a result of the lack of awareness that enduring mental health
is so statistically unusual, it has not previously attracted scientific
interest, and thus it has not been a topic of investigation as a
phenotype. To our knowledge, there are no prior studies of it. The
consequent knowledge gap about enduring mental health should be
filled by research, because if individuals who sustain enduring
mental health have special characteristics or life experiences that
distinguish them from individuals with more commonplace psy-
chiatric histories, then such discerning characteristics might be-
come interesting new targets for prevention and treatment re-
search. We note a potential parallel to gerontologists’ study of rare
individuals with unusually enduring physical health: centenarians.
Much is being learned by comparing centenarians against individ-
uals whose aging histories are more commonplace (i.e., character-
ized by age-related physical disorders). Researchers comparing
centenarians to normative agers aim to uncover secrets to success-
ful aging and identify new therapeutic targets. New therapeutic
targets are likewise needed in mental health, because mental dis-
orders are the leading cause of years lost to disability worldwide
(Whiteford et al., 2013), and are associated with higher health care
utilization, a more-than-doubled mortality rate, and a loss of life
expectancy of about 10 years (Walker, McGee, & Druss, 2015).
This article has two overarching aims. First, we aim to draw
attention to just how common mental disorders are, and, in doing
so, inform discussions surrounding etiological theories of mental
disorder, societal perceptions of stigma, and prevention efforts.
Second, we aim to encourage researchers to shift scientific inquiry
from an exclusive focus on the etiology of mental illness toward
investigation of the etiology of enduring mental wellness. Just as
research on the predictors and correlates of specific mental disor-
ders has contributed substantially to the prediction, prevention, and
treatment of these conditions, so too might research on the pre-
dictors of enduring mental health provide insight into how clini-
cians and policymakers can promote its spread in order to reduce
both societal burden and individual suffering. This article ad-
dresses the knowledge gap about enduring mental health by re-
porting basic descriptive information about its prevalence, predic-
tors, and correlates. Because readers may reasonably doubt our
claim that the experience of diagnosable mental disorder is near
universal, the first section of this article reviews existing preva-
lence findings that document the high lifetime prevalence of men-
tal disorder and the logical basis for our claim that enduring mental
health warrants scientific study. The second section then presents
an empirical study in which we identified members of a repeatedly
assessed, longitudinal cohort who experienced enduring mental
health (i.e., an absence of disorder) for close to 3 decades, and
analyzed their life circumstances, personal characteristics, and
family histories.
A Qualitative Review of the Prevalence of Not Having
a Mental Disorder
To date, researchers who have attempted to quantify the pro-
portion of the population that suffers from any kind of diagnosable
mental health problem have used data from three sources: (a)
national registries, (b) retrospective surveys, and (c) prospective
cohort studies.
Lifetime prevalence estimates generated by national registry
data are shown as green bars in Figure 1. These (sex-specific)
prevalence rates drawn from the Danish Civil Registration System
capture the proportion of the Danish population who received
treatment in a psychiatric setting between 2000 and 2012, placing
the overall lifetime risk of being treated for a mental disorder at
approximately 1 in 3, in this country with a national health system
(Pedersen et al., 2014). However, because many people with a
mental disorder either do not seek treatment or do so in nonpsy-
chiatric medical settings, these estimates can be more accurately
thought of as the lower boundary of the proportion of the popu-

ENDURING MENTAL HEALTH
 lation who experience a mental disorder during their lives (The
WHO World Mental Health Survey Consortium, 2004).
A second group of prevalence estimates comes from nationally
representative, retrospective epidemiological surveys, such as the
Epidemiological Catchment Area (ECA) Study (Regier & Robins,
1991), the National Comorbidity Survey (NCS; Kessler et al.,
1994), the National Comorbidity Survey Replication (NCS-R;
Kessler et al., 2005), and the National Epidemiologic Survey on
Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC; Compton, Thomas,
Stinson, & Grant, 2007; Hasin, Stinson, Ogburn, & Grant 2007).
As shown by the blue bars in Figure 1, these large surveys have
reported that roughly half of all citizens will develop a diagnosable
mental disorder over the course of their lives (Kessler et al., 1994,
2005). An important advantage of these studies is that, unlike
national registers, they count all cases of disorder irrespective of
service use. However, because such surveys are cross-sectional
(i.e., rely on a single retrospective report), the lifetime prevalence
estimates drawn from these data are biased downward by meth-
odological limitations such as recall failure (Simon & VonKorff,
1995). Moreover, this undercounting of disorder cases may be
exacerbated by selective participation, as individuals with mental
disorders—particularly severe mental disorders that result in
homelessness, institutionalization, or survey refusal—are less
likely to be recruited and interviewed.
Finally, a third group of mental disorder prevalence estimates
comes from prospective, longitudinal studies, which interview
participants repeatedly about psychiatric symptoms and then ag-
gregate disorders across multiple time points to calculate lifetime
rates. Although such studies involve fewer participants than epi-
demiological surveys or national registers, they also boast several
advantages that contribute to significantly higher prevalence esti-
mates (Haeny, Littlefield, & Sher, 2014; Moffitt et al., 2010;
Takayanagi et al., 2014). Like surveys, longitudinal studies count
cases irrespective of service use. In addition, they typically employ
shorter recall periods (e.g., 6–12 months) than epidemiological
surveys, thereby minimizing the odds of recall failure. Finally,
repeated contact with research staff in the context of a longitudinal
study may directly facilitate the disclosure of psychiatric symp-
toms through a heightened sense of trust that accumulates over
multiple interviews.
The red bars in Figure 1 display prevalence estimates drawn
from five longitudinal studies. In order to be included in Figure 1,
longitudinal studies had to (a) report cumulative mental disorder
lifetime prevalence estimates aggregated across multiple assess-
ment waves, (b) administer at least 3 separate diagnostic assess-
ments over time, and (c) assess a wide variety of conditions,
including those drawn from each of the three most common
disorder “families”: depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, and
substance-use disorders. As shown in Figure 1, the proportion of
participants in these studies diagnosed with a mental disorder
ranged from 61.1% to 85.3%—between roughly 1.3 and 1.8 times
as high as corresponding estimates drawn from the NCS/NCS-R,
and more than twice as high as estimates drawn from Danish
registry data, with no overlap in confidence intervals. There was
also variation among longitudinal studies, with higher lifetime
prevalence estimates tending to come from studies with more
frequent assessments and lengthier follow-up periods (Table 1).
Estimates from retrospective surveys and prospective cohort
studies have been criticized for assessing only common Axis I
disorders, omitting conditions such as personality disorders. The
impact of this limitation on estimates of the lifetime prevalence of
any diagnosable mental health problem is likely fairly small,
however, given the high level of comorbidity between personality
and common Axis I disorders (Hayward & Moran, 2008).
Viewed together, the three types of studies represented in Figure
1 converge to indicate that the proportion of the population who
lives through adolescence and adulthood without experiencing a

 mental disorder is surprisingly small. This observation is particu-
larly striking given that even the longitudinal prevalence estimates
shown in Figure 1 likely represent an underestimate of the true
prevalence of mental disorders in the population due to factors
such as gaps between assessment periods and the possibility of
selective attrition. The experience of enduring mental health,
therefore, may be substantially rarer than was previously thought.
This realization prompted us to ask the following questions: Who,
exactly, are these individuals who lead lives untouched by mental
disorders? What sorts of environments did they grow up in? And
does enduring mental health matter? That is, is a life free from
mental disorders associated with more desirable life outcomes (i.e.,
greater attainment, increased life satisfaction, and higher-quality
relationships)?
Empirical Study of Individuals With Enduring
Mental Health
The second section of this article reports an analysis of early-life
demographic, family environment, physical health, cognitive, tem-
peramental/personality, and family history characteristics of indi-
viduals who have never been diagnosed with a mental disorder
during the course of the Dunedin Longitudinal Study. In the
absence of prior research or theory on enduring mental health, we
selected from our data set measures available to us that have the
best published evidence base as important risk factors for mental
disorder. We have previously found that several of these measures
correlate with scores on the ‘p-factor,’ which represents an indi-
vidual’s propensity to develop any and all forms of common
psychopathologies (Caspi et al., 2014). We reasoned that individ-

ENDURING MENTAL HEALTH
 uals with enduring mental health (and, consequently, very low
scores on the p-factor) thus ought to be exceptionally well-
advantaged on these measures. We hypothesized, for example, that
they would have well-to-do socioeconomic origins, exceptionally
positive parent–child relations, robust physical health, high intel-
ligence, adaptive personality styles from childhood, and nil histo-
ries of psychiatric illness in their families. To add to our descrip-
tive data about individuals with enduring mental health, we also
tested the hypothesis that they would enjoy exceptionally positive
life outcomes (in the domains of educational attainment, socioeco-
nomic status, life satisfaction, and the quality of their most recent
romantic relations), as assessed at the end of our study observation
period.
The Dunedin Study assessed Study members for a variety of
common mental disorders beginning when they were 11 years of
age, and repeated these assessments every few years up until the
most recent wave, when Study members were all age 38. Because
the predictors of most forms of severe and/or chronic mental
disorders are well established, we chose to focus our analyses on
the predictors and outcomes of extraordinary mental health—that
is, what distinguishes Study members who were never diagnosed
with a mental disorder (hereafter referred to as the “enduring-
mental-health” group) from those who experienced a mental health
history that could fairly be characterized as typical (i.e., at the
mode) for the Dunedin cohort.
Method
Sample
Participants are members of the Dunedin Multidisciplinary
Health and Development Study (DMHDS), a 4-decade, longitudi-
nal investigation of health and behavior in a complete birth cohort.
Study members (N � 1,037; 91% of eligible births; 52% male)
were all individuals born between April, 1972 and March, 1973 in
Dunedin, New Zealand who were eligible for the longitudinal
study based on residence in the province at age 3, and who
participated in the first follow-up assessment at age 3. The cohort
represented the full range of SES in the general population of New
Zealand’s South Island. On adult health, the cohort matches the
NZ National Health & Nutrition Survey (e.g., body mass index,
smoking, general practitioner visits; Poulton et al., 2015). The
cohort is primarily white; fewer than 7% self-identify as having
partial non-Caucasian ancestry, matching the South Island. Assess-
ments were carried out at birth and at ages 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15,
18, 21, 26, 32, and, most recently, 38 years, when 95% of the 1,007
Study Members still alive took part. At each assessment wave,
each Study member is brought to the Dunedin research unit for a
full day of interviews and examinations. This article examines
Study members who were assessed for mental disorders at ages 11,
13, 15, 18, 21, 26, 32, and 38 years of age. The Otago Ethics
Committee approved each phase of the Study and informed con-
sent was obtained from all Study members.
Assessment of Mental Disorders
Mental disorders were ascertained in the Dunedin Study longi-
tudinally using a periodic sampling strategy: Every 2 to 6 years,
Study members were interviewed about past-year symptoms in a
private in-person interview at the research unit by trained inter-
viewers with tertiary qualifications and clinical experience in a
mental health-related field such as family medicine, clinical psy-
chology, or psychiatric social work (i.e., not lay interviewers).
Interviewers used the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children
(DIS-C) at the younger ages (11–15 years) and the Diagnostic
Interview Schedule (DIS) at the older ages (18–38 years). At each
assessment, interviewers were kept blind to Study members’ pre-
vious data, including mental health status. At ages 11, 13, and 15,
diagnoses were made according to the then-current Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (3rd ed.; American Psy-
chiatric Association [APA], 1980) and grouped for this article into
a single wave reflecting the presence or absence of a juvenile
mental disorder. At ages 18 and 21, diagnoses were made accord-
ing to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders
(3rd ed, rev.; DSM–III–R; APA, 1987) and at ages 26, 32, and 38
diagnoses were made according to the Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed.; DSM–IV; APA, 1994). This
method led to 6 waves in total representing ages 11–15, 18, 21, 26,
32, and 38. In addition to symptom criteria, diagnosis required
impairment ratings �2 on a scale from 1 (some impairment) to 5
(severe impairment). Each disorder was diagnosed regardless of
the presence of other disorders. Variable construction details,
reliability and validity, and evidence of life impairment for diag-
noses have been reported previously. Of the original 1,037 Study
members, we included 988 (95.3%) Study members who had
participated in at least half of the six mental health assessment
waves from ages 11 to 38. Of these Study members, 849 (85.9%)
contributed data to all 6 waves, 88 (8.9%) contributed data to 5
waves, 32 (3.2%) contributed data to 4 waves, and 19 (1.9%)
contributed data to 3 waves.
Candidate Childhood Predictors
To test what distinguishes Study members who experienced
enduring mental health from their peers, we report on 13 different
predictors, selected because they are thought to be associated with
risk of developing a mental disorder: parental socioeconomic
status, positive family climate, negative discipline, maltreatment,
parental loss, perinatal complications, childhood health, preschool
IQ, middle childhood IQ, emotional difficulties, social isolation,
self-control, and family psychiatric history. These measures are
described in Table 1 in the online supplementary material.
Midlife Outcomes
Educational attainment.
Educational attainment at age 38 was
measured on a four-point scale relevant to the New Zealand educa-
tional system: 0 � no secondary school qualifications, 1 � school
certificate, 2 � high school graduate or equivalent, 3 � bachelor’s
degree or higher.
Socioeconomic attainment (SES).
At age 38, Study members
were asked about their current or most recent occupation. The SES of
the study members was measured on a 6-point scale that assessed
self-reported occupational status and allocates each occupation to 1 of
6 categories (1 � unskilled laborer, 6 � professional) on the basis of
the educational levels and income associated with that occupation in
data from the New Zealand census. Homemakers and those not
working were prorated based on their educational status according to

 criteria included in the New Zealand Socioeconomic Index (Milne,
2012).
Life satisfaction.
At age 38, Study members completed the
5-item Satisfaction With Life Scale (e.g., “In most ways my life is
close to ideal”; “So far I have gotten the important things I want in
life”; Pavot & Diener, 1993).
Relationship quality.
At age 38, Study members who reported
being in a relationship for at least one month during the past year
reported on a 28-item scale about their current or most recent rela-
tionship, covering relationship characteristics such as shared activities
and interests, the balance of power, respect and fairness, emotional
intimacy and trust, and open communication. Each of these items was
coded on a 3-point scale (0 � Almost never, 1 � Sometimes, 2 �
Almost always). We summed these ratings across items to create
a composite measure reflecting overall relationship quality
(� � .93). Of the 988 Study members who had participated in
at least half of the six mental health assessments from ages 11
to 38, 841 (85.1%) reported a current or recent relationship at
age 38.
Results
Defining Mental Health Histories Over the First Half
of the Life Course
Figure 2a displays the number of waves (from 0 to 6) in which
Study members met criteria for one or more mental disorders. On
average, cohort members met criteria for a mental disorder on 2.3
of the six assessment waves, but there was a great deal of variation.
The most common mental health history in the cohort appeared to
be one characterized by a relatively brief, episodic course of
disorder, in which Study members met diagnostic criteria for a
disorder at only 1 or 2 assessment waves (N � 409). We also
included in this group 9 Study members who were not diagnosed
with a mental disorder by Dunedin Study staff, but reported
receiving a psychiatric diagnosis while using mental health ser-
vices in the gaps between assessment waves.1 Study members who
experienced enduring mental health (i.e., met diagnostic criteria at
0 waves), in contrast, were a distinct minority, comprising only
17.3% of the cohort (N � 171).2 The remainder of the cohort were
Study members who had met criteria for one or more mental
disorder diagnoses at 3 � waves (N � 408). It is important to note
that Study members were not classified as having enduring mental
health simply because they participated in fewer waves: On aver-
age, Study members with enduring mental health had complete
data on 5.7 (out of 6) waves, whereas Study members who met
diagnostic criteria at 1–2 waves had complete data on 5.8 waves,
and Study members who met diagnostic criteria at 3–6 waves had
complete data on 5.8 waves.
Figure 2b displays the temporal pattern of psychiatric diagnoses
across the life course of the cohort, from ages 11 to 38 years. The
figure shows that the diagnosed groups were not dominated by any
particular developmental pattern.
Table 2 displays indicators of disorder type, age-of-onset, and
severity for individuals as a function of mental health-history
group. Relative to the Study members diagnosed at 3 � waves,
those with typical mental health histories (i.e., diagnosed at 1–2
waves) presented with a narrower set of disorders (primarily
depression, anxiety, and substance dependence), an older age of
onset, less comorbidity, and lower scores on a general factor of
psychopathology (Caspi et al., 2014).
Informant Reports: To What Extent Do They Confirm
the Enduring Mental Health of Never-Diagnosed
Study Members?
Given the high lifetime prevalence of mental disorders, it is
reasonable to wonder whether Study members classified as expe-
riencing “enduring mental health” are, in fact, simply those with a
tendency to down-play or deny genuine past-year psychiatric
symptoms during clinical interviews. As an additional “check” for
evidence of mental disorder, we reviewed informant reports to see
if these Study members showed any outwardly perceivable signs
of common mental disorders. At ages 18, 21, 26, 32, and 38, we
asked Study members to nominate someone who knew them well
(e.g., best friends, partners, or other family members). These
informants were mailed questionnaires which asked them “To the
best of your knowledge, did ________ have any of these problems
over the last 12 months?” Items included “Feels depressed, mis-
erable, sad, or unhappy,” “Has unreasonable worries or fears,”
“Has alcohol problems,” “Marijuana or other drug problems,” and
(at ages 26, 32, and 38), “Talks about suicide.” Informants were
asked to rate these items on a 3-point scale (0 � Not a problem,
1 � Bit of a problem, 2 � Yes, a problem). In analyzing these data,
we took a conservative approach, treating a rating of “2” by any
informant during any assessment wave as evidence of symptom-
atic behavior. Informant report data were available for 987
(99.9%) of the 988 Study members reported here.
Although informant reports provide a useful complement to
self-reported symptoms, endorsements of symptomatic behaviors
must be interpreted with caution. The informant questionnaire was
not designed to correspond directly with DSM diagnoses or diag-
nostic criteria. Therefore, many informants may have been in-
clined to endorse Study member “problems” (e.g., “feels de-
pressed, miserable, sad, or unhappy”) even when these issues were
not of sufficient severity to meet diagnostic criteria for a DSM-
defined mental disorder (e.g., major depression).
As shown in the bottom panel of Table 2, informant reports
largely confirmed the absence of mental health problems among
Study members with enduring mental health. From ages 18 to 38,
only 36 (21.1%) Study members with enduring mental health had
an informant report that they showed evidence of problems with
depression, unreasonable fears, alcohol, drugs, or had talked about
suicide (compared to 38.9% and 63.4% of Study members diag-
nosed at 1–2 and 3 � waves, respectively). According to infor-
1 Because it is possible that past-year reports separated by 1 to 5 years
miss episodes of mental disorder occurring only in gaps between assess-
ments, we reviewed life-history calendar interviews of Study members to
ascertain indicators of mental disorder occurring in these gaps, including
inpatient treatment, outpatient treatment, or spells taking prescribed psy-
chiatric medication (indicators that are salient and recalled more reliably
than individual symptoms). Life-history calendar data indicated that all but
9 Study members who experienced a disorder consequential enough to be
associated with treatment (many of whom had a brief postnatal depression)
were detected in our net of past-year diagnoses made at ages 11 to 38.
2 Four of these 171 Study members met symptom criteria for a mental
disorder at some point during the Study, but rated their impairment as a 1
out of 5, thus avoiding a diagnosis.

ENDURING MENTAL HEALTH
 mants, the most common problem for these Study members was
feeling depressed (15.8%), with only a small handful of informants
reporting problems with unreasonable fears (8.2%), alcohol
(1.8%), drugs (1.8%), or talking about suicide (0.6%).
What Distinguishes Study Members Who Experienced
Enduring Mental Health From Those Who
Experienced “Typical” Mental Health Histories?
It has been repeatedly demonstrated that individuals with severe,
persistent, or recurrent mental disorders differ from individuals
without such disorders in multiple ways. This well-established
finding was confirmed in our study: Table 3 shows that Study
members diagnosed at 3 � waves had more childhood risk factors
across each domain compared to both Study members with endur-
ing mental health and Study members diagnosed at 1–2 waves.
The key comparison in this article, however, is between Study
members who were never diagnosed with a mental disorder, and
those who experienced a mental health history that resembles the
histories of the majority of other Study members (i.e., the “1-2
wave” group). By comparing Study members with enduring men-
tal health to those with more typical mental health histories across
candidate predictor variables hypothesized to discriminate be-
tween them, we can distinguish factors predictive of enduring
mental health from those that simply predict the absence of a
severe, persistent, or recurrent disorder.
Although we had expected to find that Study members with
enduring mental health were significantly advantaged across all 13
of our candidate predictors relative to Study members with typical
histories, this hypothesis received only mixed support. First, we
found that Study members with enduring mental health were
surprisingly similar to Study members who met diagnostic criteria
at 1–2 waves in terms of parental socioeconomic status, childhood
physical health, and childhood cognitive ability (the observed
distribution of mean predictor variable scores across the number of
waves in which Study members received a diagnosis can be seen
in Figure 1 in the online supplemental materials). Second, although
we found some evidence to suggest that Study members in the two
groups differed in their upbringing, analyses using these variables
returned mixed results. Third, Study members with enduring men-
tal health showed statistically significant advantages in childhood
temperament/personality relative to Study members diagnosed at
1–2 waves, including fewer emotional difficulties, less social
isolation, and superior self-control. Finally, Study members with
enduring mental health also had significantly fewer first- and
second-degree relatives who showed signs of mental disorder
(Table 3).
Thus far, we have characterized Study members’ mental health
histories as a function of persistence or recurrence; that is, by the
number of waves in our longitudinal study during which they
received a diagnosis. We found that a mental health history in
which the Study member met diagnostic criteria for a mental
disorder at 1 or 2 waves was the most common pattern. Another
way to characterize mental health histories, however, is as a
function of comorbidity; that is, by the number of different types

Mental disorder diagnoses in the Dunedin Cohort (N � 988). Panel A: Number of waves in which
Dunedin Study members met criteria for a DSM diagnosis. The 6 waves represent ages 11–15, 18, 21, 26, 32,
and 38. The red bar represents Study members with enduring mental health (those diagnosed at 0 waves). The
light blue bars represent Study members with typical mental health histories (those diagnosed at 1–2 waves). The
dark blue bars represent Study members diagnosed at 3 � waves. Panel B: Distribution of DSM diagnoses across
assessment waves. Each thin horizontal line represents an individual Study member’s mental health history. Blue
indicates that the Study member met criteria for a past-year DSM -defined psychiatric disorder during this
assessment. Red indicates that the Study member did not meet criteria for a past-year DSM-defined psychiatric
disorder during this assessment. Panel B shows that the largest proportion of Study members met diagnostic
criteria at 1–2 waves, but that neither these individuals nor those diagnosed at 3 � waves were characterized by
any particular developmental pattern (e.g., adolescent-limited course of disorder or late-onset forms of disorder).

 of disorder categories or “families” represented in Study members’
accumulated diagnostic histories. To ensure that the results in
Table 3 were not dependent on the particular way in which we
classified the severity of Study members’ mental health histories,
we repeated these analyses using a classification scheme based on
comorbidity rather than recurrence or persistence. As shown in
Figure 2 in the online supplemental material, the same group of
171 Study members received no diagnosis throughout the course
of the study, and were thus considered to experience enduring
mental health by virtue of having no psychiatric comorbidity. Our
new comparison group, however, consisted of 540 Study members
who were diagnosed with disorders from 1–2 different diagnostic
families, the cohort “comorbidity mode.” Similarly, our most
severe group consisted of the 277 remaining Study members with
mental health histories characterized by unusually high comorbid-
ity, or diagnoses from 3 � different diagnostic families. Our
substantive conclusions regarding the most and least effective
predictors of enduring mental health remained almost entirely
unchanged under this alternate classification scheme (see Table 2
in the online supplemental material). This stability is largely at-
tributable to the fact that comorbidity and number of waves with
disorder are highly correlated (r � .80, p � .001), as are most
indicators of disorder severity. The most common mental health
history in our data thus appears to be characterized not only by
disorders of relatively short duration but also those that are diag-
nostically “pure” (that is, with limited lifetime comorbidity).
Is Enduring Mental Health Associated With More
Desirable Life Outcomes (i.e., Greater Educational
and Occupational Attainment, Increased Life
Satisfaction, and Higher Quality Relationships)?
As shown in Figure 3, despite their comparable socioeconomic
background, Study members with enduring mental health achieved
higher levels of educational and socioeconomic attainment by age
38 than Study members who had experienced 1–2 waves of dis-
order. Study members with enduring mental health also expressed
higher levels of life satisfaction when interviewed at age 38 than
Study members diagnosed at 1–2 waves. Interestingly, although
Study members with enduring mental health were just as likely to
report being in a relationship at age 38 as Study members diag-
nosed at 1–2 waves (91.1% vs. 92.8%, respectively; �2 � 0.40,

Discussion
Far from being the aberrant experience of a small, stigmatized
subgroup, data from both the Dunedin Study and other longitudinal
studies suggest that experiencing a diagnosable mental disorder at
some point during the life course is the norm, not the exception. In
our cohort, whose members have been repeatedly assessed for
common mental disorders by trained professionals over a span of
close to three decades, only 17% of repeatedly assessed Study
members managed to reach midlife (age 38) without experiencing
the psychiatric symptoms and resulting functional impairment
necessary to meet criteria for the diagnosis of a mental disorder.
To some, the proportion of Dunedin Study members diagnosed
with at least one mental disorder may seem unusually high, raising
concerns about the representativeness of our sample. However, we
have shown elsewhere that the past-year prevalence rates of mental
disorders in the Dunedin cohort are similar to prevalence rates in
nationwide surveys of the United States and of New Zealand. This
observation indicates that the higher Axis-I-disorder lifetime prev-
alence rate in our study is due primarily to the advantage of our
prospective assessment method rather than to an overabundance of
mental disorder in New Zealand, or in our cohort (Moffitt et al.,
2010). Similarly, although Axis-I-disorder lifetime prevalence es-
timates drawn from the Dunedin Study and Christchurch Study are
modestly higher than those of other longitudinal studies with
similar methodologies (Figure 1), this discrepancy is likely due to
differences in study design. To our knowledge, the Dunedin Study
is one of the only prospective, longitudinal studies with nearly
three decades of mental health assessments that stretch from late
childhood (when the earliest cases of most mental disorders first
onset) through adolescence and young adulthood (the time of peak
onset for many of these same disorders) and into midlife. The
Christchurch Study captures a similar period of development with
the additional advantage of mental health assessments that cover
the full time period between assessments (rather than just counting
symptoms experienced within the past 12 months). We anticipate
that Axis-I-disorder lifetime prevalence estimates drawn from sim-
ilar studies of younger cohorts (e.g., Copeland, Shanahan,
Costello, & Angold, 2011) will eventually mirror (or exceed) the
values obtained from these New Zealand studies as these cohorts
are followed forward.
There is an extensive literature linking childhood attributes and
experiences to later mental disorder. Usually, it is implicitly as-
sumed that individuals without the disorder (“controls”) represent
“normality,” whereas those who do develop the disorder (“cases”)
represent “abnormality.” However, data reported here indicate that
the statistically “typical” Study member is a person with at least
some transient history of diagnosable psychopathology. Conse-
quently, we sought to identify early life variables that differenti-
ated between those with “typical” mental health histories and those
with extraordinary histories marked by no episodes of diagnosable
mental disorder whatsoever (at least, as far as we know). The
utility provided by this type of comparison is that it helps to
distinguish between variables that predict enduring mental health
and those that predict the onset of severe mental disorders (but
perhaps fail to distinguish between individuals on the opposite end
of the spectrum). Our finding that relatively few early life mea-
sures seem to predict above-average mental health, whereas many

 predict very poor mental health is perhaps not surprising. Indeed,
identifying measures that do distinguish between Study members
with enduring mental health and those with typical mental health
histories should be significantly more difficult than identifying
measures that predict the more severely ill cases given that milder,
more transient episodes of disorder are more likely to be attribut-
able to situational, stochastic factors rather than enduring vulner-
abilities.
Given the remarkably low prevalence of enduring mental health
in the Dunedin cohort, we expected Study members with enduring
mental health to come from backgrounds virtually free of each of
our 13 well-established predictors. This expectation was strongly
supported when we compared Study members with enduring men-
tal health to Study members diagnosed at 3 � waves, but unsup-
ported when comparing Study members with enduring mental
health to Study members diagnosed at 1–2 assessment waves
(Table 3).
We identified only two childhood factors that clearly differen-
tiated between Study members with enduring mental health and
those diagnosed only at 1 or 2 waves: (a) a suite of advantageous
personality traits and (b) a relative absence of family psychiatric
history. Consistent with research that names a neurotic personality
style as a risk factor for multiple different mental disorders (Ken-
dler, Gatz, Gardner, & Pedersen, 2006; Lahey, 2009), we found
that Study members who showed little evidence of strong negative
emotions in childhood were more likely to experience enduring
mental health into their late 30s. Similarly, consistent with re-
search that names abundant social support and sociability as “buf-
fers” against stress (e.g., Ozbay et al., 2007), we also found that
Study members with enduring mental health were significantly
less socially isolated in childhood than peers with typical histories
(or, alternatively, these exceptionally well-adjusted children were
more attractive to peers, and thus acquired more childhood
friends). In addition, we found that Study members with enduring
mental health showed significantly higher levels of childhood
self-control, in line with previous reports from this cohort demon-
strating that higher self-control in childhood predicts other advan-
tageous adult outcomes such as superior physical health, fewer
financial problems, less criminal offending, and lower risk of
substance dependence (Israel et al., 2014; Moffitt et al., 2011).
Finally, consistent with research indicating substantial familial
aggregation of common psychiatric and substance-use disorders
(Kendler, Davis, & Kessler, 1997), we found that Study members
who experienced enduring mental health had fewer first- and
second-degree relatives with mental health issues relative to Study
members diagnosed at 1–2 waves.
Our analyses of family factors returned mixed results. We found
evidence to indicate that, relative to Study members with typical
mental health histories, those with enduring mental health experi-
enced a family environment characterized by less negative disci-
pline and a reduced likelihood of parental loss. Surprisingly,
however, the remainder of our childhood predictors did not seem
to differ between the two groups. For example, we found that
individuals with enduring mental health were not more socioeco-
nomically advantaged than those with typical histories, despite
evidence linking low childhood socioeconomic status to multiple
mental disorders (Reiss, 2013). In addition, Study members with
enduring mental health showed no evidence of fewer perinatal
complications or superior physical health in childhood, despite
evidence linking perinatal complications and poor health in child-
hood to multiple mental disorders (Buka & Fan, 1999; Foley,
Thacker, Aggen, Neale, & Kendler, 2001; Merikangas et al.,
2015). And finally, Study members with enduring mental health
were not found to possess higher childhood intelligence than Study
members diagnosed at 1–2 waves, even though multiple studies
have confirmed low IQ as a risk factor for a wide array of
psychiatric conditions (Batty, Mortensen, & Osler, 2005; Gale et
al., 2008; Koenen et al., 2009). These observations suggest that
although childhood poverty, compromised physical health, and
low cognitive ability are robust predictors of persistent mental
disorder, their absence is unlikely to guarantee enduring mental
health.
The predictive strength of our temperament/personality mea-
sures is perhaps unsurprising, given that they capture, in part,
behaviors that could be viewed as juvenile manifestations of adult
disorders (e.g., our measure of childhood emotional difficulties
captures behaviors like frequent worrying, and often appearing sad
or tearful). Nevertheless, our finding that these measures are
capable of predicting which Study members will reach their late
30s without ever experiencing a diagnosable disorder suggests that
the path to enduring mental health begins early in development, as
is the case with many mental disorders (Kessler et al., 2005;
Kim-Cohen et al., 2003).
The present study is characterized by several limitations. First,
although findings about the low prevalence of enduring mental
health have appeared across studies, our findings regarding the
correlates of enduring mental health were drawn from a single,

ENDURING MENTAL HEALTH
 largely Caucasian, New Zealand cohort born in the 1970s, and thus
may not generalize to other populations. Second, assessment of
mental disorder in the Dunedin cohort is both left- and right-hand
censored, which means we cannot count episodes of disorder that
occurred prior to age 11, or future cases that may onset after our
most recent assessment at age 38. Third, gaps between the Dun-
edin Study’s 12-month assessment windows did not allow us to
count individuals who experienced an episode of disorder between
windows. Although we were able to use life history calendar
interviews to reclassify 9 Study members who were not diagnosed
by Study staff but reported being diagnosed and treated during
these gaps into the “1–2 wave” group, the number of cohort
members we classified incorrectly because their only episodes of
disorder occurred between Study windows and went untreated is
unknown. However, it is worth noting that the Dunedin Study’s
Axis-I-disorder lifetime prevalence estimate is very similar to the
Axis-I-disorder lifetime prevalence estimate drawn from the
Christchurch Study (Figure 1), which asks Study members at each
assessment to extend their recall of psychiatric symptoms back to
the previous assessment (thus avoiding gaps in assessment win-
dows). This observation suggests that the number of Dunedin
Study members who did experience a mental disorder but were
“missed” by our eight past-year assessments is likely to be rela-
tively small.
Replication of this study is needed. However, the study of
enduring mental health poses a challenge for researchers, since
classifying individuals as having experienced “enduring mental
health” on the basis of a single clinical interview assessing lifetime
psychiatric symptoms may result in substantial misclassification.
One possibility suggested by our results is to further refine phe-
notyping by screening this group to also be free of a family history
of psychiatric disorder.
The comparative rarity of the enduring-mental health phenotype
has implications for etiological research into mental disorders.
Studies of individuals with enduring mental health can comple-
ment studies of mental disorders in much the same way studies of
centenarians complement studies of age-related disease (e.g.,
Galioto et al., 2008; Sebastiani & Perls, 2012). One way is by
identifying targets for prevention. For example, our study suggests
the hypothesis that interventions to promote children’s develop-
ment of self-control skills might prevent subsequent mental disor-
der. Nonetheless, a limitation of the Dunedin Study is that it was
not originally designed to study predictors of enduring mental
health, because no one anticipated that it would be so rare as to be
an interesting phenotype. As a result, our investigation was con-
strained by our set of pre-existing early life risk factors for mental
disorder, suggesting that studies with richer sets of early-life,
mental-health-promoting factors are needed.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, ours is not the first study to attempt to
identify a “completely psychiatrically healthy” group of people.
Indeed, control groups consisting of individuals who were
screened to be free from any history of either psychiatric diagnosis
or treatment were commonly used in early studies of psychiatric
genetics, particularly those examining familial aggregation (e.g.,
Coryell & Zimmerman, 1988; Weissman et al., 1984). The extent
to which these earlier studies were successful in screening out all
individuals who may have at one point met criteria for a psychi-
atric diagnosis, however, is unclear, especially given that the
pitfalls of retrospective psychiatric assessments did not become
clear until a few years later.
Our findings add weight to the suggestion that research psycholo-
gists and psychiatrists should be cautious whenever they attempt to
define and assemble a “healthy control group,” particularly when
participants are categorized solely on the basis of a single retrospec-
tive assessment of lifetime psychiatric symptoms (see Streiner, Patten,
Anthony, & Cairney, 2009, for a thoughtful review of this issue).
Because of the extremely high rates of lifetime disorder, it is likely
that any “control group” defined without the use of repeated assess-
ments will contain (a) participants with enduring mental health who
have never met criteria for the disorder of interest nor any psychiatric
comorbidities, (b) participants who have never met criteria for the
disorder of interest, but who have met (or currently do meet) criteria
for psychiatric comorbidities, and (c) participants who do not cur-
rently meet criteria for the disorder of interest, but did meet criteria in
the past and have since forgotten or reframed this experience. The
inadvertent inclusion of group (c) into the larger control group could
lead to an attenuation of observed case-control differences, potentially
reducing power to detect real effects. Conversely, a more stringent
assessment process (e.g., repeated assessments of psychiatric status
over time), could increase statistical power by bolstering researchers’
ability to correctly categorize study participants.
A final, intriguing question is whether enduring mental health is
associated with exceptional psychological “well-being,” in addi-
tion to minimal psychological distress. Research in the fields of
positive psychiatry and psychology indicates that measures of
“mental health” and “mental illness” are at best moderately cor-
related (Keyes, 2005), and that true well-being or “flourishing”
(i.e., feeling good about and functioning well in life) is more than
merely the absence of a diagnosable disorder (Jeste, Palmer,
Rettew, & Boardman, 2015; Keyes, 2002; Seligman & Csikszent-
mihalyi, 2000). Our data suggest that Study members with endur-
ing mental health (as defined here) share many similarities with
individuals who are described as “flourishing” in other studies,
including superior adult functioning (as measured by midlife ed-
ucational and occupational attainment) as well as greater life
satisfaction and higher-quality relationships. This overlap suggests
the hypothesis that the absence of disorder may facilitate the
acquisition of other desirable psychosocial traits and outcomes
across the life course. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that our
never-diagnosed Study members were not universally satisfied
with life—indeed, approximately one quarter (22.5%) scored be-
low the cohort mean on our measure of life satisfaction. This
observation indicates that “enduring mental health” and “flourish-
ing” should not be used interchangeably, and suggests that addi-
tional research is needed to clarify the nature of the relationship
between these two constructs.
In conclusion, the observations that mental disorder affects the
overwhelming majority of persons at some point in life and that its
course is often transient suggest a need to alter our conception of what
it means to be mentally ill. For many, an episode of mental disorder
is like influenza, bronchitis, anemia, kidney stones, or a fractured
bone—these conditions are highly prevalent, sufferers experience
impaired functioning in social and occupational roles, and many seek
medical care, but most recover. Put another way, such research
affirms that discussions of “abnormal psychology” should recognize
that “normality” refers to the absence of a diagnosable disturbance in
emotional or behavioral functioning at the present time—not across

 the life course. It is our hope that increased public recognition of this
fact will reduce the stigma experienced by individuals diagnosed with
a mental disorder, perhaps leading to higher rates of treatment uptake
as well as better clinical outcomes.
