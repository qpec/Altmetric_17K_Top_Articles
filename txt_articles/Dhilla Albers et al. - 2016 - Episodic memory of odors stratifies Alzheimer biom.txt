Abstract
Objective—To relate a novel test of identifying and recalling odor percepts to biomarkers of 
Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) in well-characterized elderly individuals, ranging from cognitively 
normal to demented.
Methods—183 participants (cognitively normal: n=70, subjective cognitive concerns: n=74, Mild 
Cognitive Impairment (MCI): n=29, AD dementia: n=10) were administered novel olfactory tests: 
the Odor Percept IDentification (OPID) and the Percepts of Odor Episodic Memory (POEM) tests. 
Univariate cross-sectional analyses of performance across diagnoses; logistic regression modeling 
including covariates of age, gender, education, APOE genotype, and neuropsychological test 
scores; and linear mixed modeling of longitudinal cognitive scores were performed. Amyloid 
deposition and MRI volumetrics were analyzed in a subset of participants.
Results—Accuracy of identification and episodic memory of odor percepts differed significantly 
across diagnosis and age, with progressively worse performance across degrees of impairment.

 Among the participants who were cognitively normal or had subjective cognitive concerns, poorer 
than expected performance on the POEM test (based on the same individual’s performance on the 
OPID and odor discrimination tests) was associated with higher frequencies of the APOE ε4 
allele, thinner entorhinal cortices, and worse longitudinal trajectory of Logical Memory scores.
Interpretation—Selective impairment of episodic memory of odor percepts, relative to 
identification and discrimination of odor percepts revealed by this novel POEM battery, is 
associated with biomarkers of AD in a well-characterized pre-MCI population. These affordable, 
non-invasive olfactory tests offer potential to identify clinically normal individuals who have 
greater likelihood of future cognitive decline.
INTRODUCTION
The pathophysiology of AD precedes the onset of cognitive symptoms by a decade or more 
(1). The validation of indices to identify cognitively healthy individuals at risk for 
developing the progressive memory symptoms of AD, and to follow these individuals over 
time is essential for conducting therapeutic trials in this preclinical phase (2). Biomarkers 
that detect evidence of pathology and are verified for the dementia and MCI phases of AD, 
e.g., volumetric MRI (3), PET imaging (4) and CSF (5), are under examination in preclinical 
populations. However, their cost and/or invasiveness may serve as an obstacle to their 
implementation as a primary screen in clinical trials or in the general population.
Functional assessments, including neuropsychological testing (6), that probe the integrity of 
vulnerable brain regions may offer sensitivity that is independent of the heterogeneous 
molecular mechanisms of AD. These assessments may also be sensitive to 
neurodegeneration, which can occur very early in the preclinical period (7). The regions of 
the brain that process olfactory input, including the entorhinal cortex and the olfactory bulb, 
are vulnerable to AD pathology, even in asymptomatic individuals (8). Impaired smell 
identification is a consistent finding in patients in the dementia and prodromal stages of AD, 
and has recently been reported in the preclinical stages of AD as well (9). However, such 
smell identification deficits revealed by traditional tests like the University of Pennsylvania 
Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) (10) lack specificity to AD as olfactory deficits are also 
associated with Parkinson’s disease (11) as well as aging (12) and end organ perturbations.
To address these limitations, we developed the novel Odor Percept IDentification (OPID) 
and the Percepts of Odor Episodic Memory (POEM) tests. We hypothesized that a task 
incorporating working memory and episodic memory of odor percepts would improve the 
efficacy of olfaction as a biomarker of preclinical AD, since performance on these tasks 
would be expected to reflect the integrity of both the olfactory and memory neural systems 
(11). An odor percept is the mental impression of an experienced smell isolated from other 
contextual information. In the UPSIT, response choices are viewed by the participant before 
sampling the test odor. In our ten-item and twenty-item OPID tests, the participant has no 
visual or semantic information to contextualize the odor that s/he is sniffing. The working 
memory delay component is introduced into the identification tests by having participants 
answer a Yes/No question between the odor delivery and the presentation of odor 
identification choices. In the OPID-10, the Yes/No question is whether the participant finds

 the odor familiar; in the OPID-20, the Yes/No question is whether the presented odor was 
included among the odors presented in the earlier OPID-10. These responses, embedded 
within the OPID-20, constitute the POEM test. Here we report the validation of this novel 
olfactory battery administered to a well characterized cohort of elderly individuals 
representing the continuum of AD and that selective loss of episodic memory of odor 
percepts identifies clinically normal elderly with an enrichment in other validated 
biomarkers of AD.
METHODS
Participants
We recruited 183 community-dwelling participants over the age 65 who were recruited from 
the Longitudinal Cohort (LC) of the Massachusetts Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center 
(B.T.H., P.I.) (13) or from the MGH Memory Disorders Clinic (5 AD patients). Fourteen of 
these participants were also enrolled in the Harvard Aging Brain Study (R.A.S., P.I.) (4). 
Our participants were diagnosed at the time of olfactory testing as cognitively normal (CN) 
(n=70), subjective cognitive concerns (SCC, with concerns about their cognition but had 
normal cognitive testing) (n=74), or amnestic or non-amnestic mild cognitive impairment 
(MCI) (n=29) and possible or probable AD (n=10) (Table 1). All participants underwent 
informed consent before participation. The research protocol was approved by the 
Institutional Review Board of Partners Healthcare.
Eligibility Criteria
Criteria for enrollment included good general health without any unstable medical diagnoses 
or active psychiatric disorders, and a study partner who could provide collateral information 
about the participant’s cognition and daily functioning. At the initial visit, participants were 
≥54 years of age, had a Geriatric Depression Scale (14) long form score ≤10, and had a 
Modified Hachinski Ischemic Score ≤4 (15). Participants in our sample were recruited to the 
ADRC, on average, 5.4 years, prior to their first visit for the olfactory study.
Olfactory screening
Participants (and study partners, when appropriate) completed a questionnaire that surveyed 
medical factors that may confound olfactory function (septal deviation, difficulty breathing 
through one side of nose, history of radiation or chemotherapy, history of nasal surgery) 
(16). Participants were excluded from the study if they presented with respiratory distress or 
an active sinus / upper respiratory infection at the time of testing, known nasal polyps, a 
history of anaphylaxis to nuts, traumatic or congenital anosmia, current or recent (past 6 
months) alcohol or substance dependence, or pregnancy. No participants were excluded from 
the study based upon these criteria.
Olfactometer
The olfactory battery was administered in a quiet room with a research assistant present to 
provide instructions and assist with entering response choices into the laptop driving the 
portable OLFACT olfactometer (Osmic Enterprises, Cincinnati, OH). The olfactometer has a 
dedicated line for the delivery of each odor to prevent cross-contamination. Each response

 choice and reaction time are recorded by the software program that triggers the olfactometer. 
For each test, participants were seated next to the olfactometer, given test instructions, and 
underwent a trial run of odor presentation and response choice to acclimate to the timing and 
tasks of the test. All collected data were imported and stored in a customized MySQL 
database.
Olfactory Evaluation
Three olfactory tests were administered, in the same order:
1.
The OPID-10 (Figure 1A) employs 10 odors found to be predictive for 
conversion from MCI to AD, i.e., menthol, clove, leather, strawberry, lilac, 
pineapple, smoke, soap, grape and lemon (16). Participants were visually 
cued to get ready to sniff and then presented an odor for 2 s. Subsequently, 
they were asked “Is this odor familiar to you?” (Yes/No), and then were 
visually presented four words and asked to select the word that best 
identified the presented odor.
•
The Odor Awareness Scale (17) (OAS), which provides a 
measure of how attentive participants are to their olfactory 
sense and how influenced they are behaviorally and 
emotionally by their olfactory perceptions, was 
administered between tests 1 and 2 (and served as a 10-
minute delay).
2.
A 20-item test (10 odors presented in the OPID-10 and 10 novel odors) 
that constitute the POEM test and OPID-20 tests (Figure 1B). The protocol 
is similar to the OPID-10 except the question following the presentation of 
the odor is “Did you smell this odor in the previous test?” (Yes/No).
3.
The odor discrimination test (OD) (Figure 1C) employs 12 trials where 2 
odors are presented consecutively, and participants are asked if the odors 
were the “Same” or “Different”.
Clinical / Neuropsychological / Neuroimaging Evaluations
All participants underwent comprehensive evaluations consisting of a medical history, 
neuropsychological battery (18), and neurological examination prior to olfactory testing. 
Visual naming, to control for any aphasic contribution, was assessed with the 30-item 
Boston Naming Test (BNT) performed at the time of olfactory testing. After an interview 
with the participants and informants, clinicians rated each participant on the Clinical 
Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SOB) in the domains of memory, orientation, 
judgment and problem solving, community affairs, home and hobbies, and personal care 
(19). Each subject was tested at each visit with the MMSE, Logical Memory II (LMII), 
Digit-Symbol Decoding (DSD) and delayed recall on the California Verbal Learning Test 
(CVLT). MRI and PiB PET data collected from participants participating in concurrent 
studies were assembled; the timespan between the neuroimaging evaluations and olfactory 
testing averaged 2.1 years (5.1 years before to 0.8 years after olfactory testing; imaging 
preceded olfactory testing for 88% of subjects) for PiB and 1.4 years (5.0 years before to 0.8

 years after olfactory testing; imaging preceded olfactory testing for 84% of subjects) for 
MRI scans.
Structural MRI acquisition and processing
MRI scanning was completed on 49 participants as previously described (3). Briefly, in a 
Siemens TIM Trio 3T System with a 12-channel head coil, structural T1-weighted 
volumetric magnetization-prepared, rapid acquisition gradient echo scans were collected 
(TR/TE/TI=6400/2.8/900ms, flip angle=8°, 1×1×1.2mm resolution). Region of interest 
labeling was performed using FreeSurfer v5.1 (http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/). Ex vivo 
measurements of entorhinal cortex (EC) thickness were averaged across hemispheres to 
yield mean bilateral EC thickness values. Hippocampal volume (HV)) was averaged across 
hemispheres and divided by intracranial volume (ICV) to adjust for variance in head size 
across patients.
PiB-PET acquisition and processing
PiB-PET scanning was completed in 41 participants on a Siemens ECAT EXACT HR+ PET 
scanner. 11C-PiB was synthesized using a previously published protocol (20). After injection 
of 8.5 – 15 mCi PiB, 60 min. of dynamic data were acquired in 3D acquisition mode. PIB-
PET data was reconstructed using filtered back projection with weighted attenuation. The 
Logan graphical analysis method with cerebellar cortex as the reference tissue input function 
was used to evaluate specific PiB retention expressed as the distribution volume ratio 
(DVR). PiB DVR was calculated for an aggregate of cortical regions that typically have 
elevated PiB retention in AD dementia. Binary PiB status was assigned with a cut-off value 
of 1.20 DVR for the aggregate described above (DVR ≥ 1.20, PiB-positive; DVR < 1.20, 
PiB-negative). The cut-off was established using Gaussian mixture modeling, as previously 
described (20).
Statistical Analyses
A chi-square test was used to assess differences in gender across diagnoses. Fisher’s exact 
test was used to compare APOE genotype across diagnoses. One-way ANOVAs were used 
to compare age, education, and OAS score (assessed at the time of olfactory testing) across 
diagnoses (CN, SCC, MCI, and AD). A one-way ANOVA was also used for the analysis of 
Trails B time, which was transformed using the Box-Cox procedure (21) to help satisfy the 
normality assumption of ANOVA. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to analyze CDR-SOB, 
MMSE, and BNT scores across diagnoses, while simple logistic regression was used to 
compare the proportions of correct responses in the OPID-10, OPID-20, OD, and POEM 
tests across diagnoses. For pairwise comparisons between diagnoses, we used Holm’s 
stepdown method (22) to correct p-values for multiple comparisons. A subgroup analysis of 
CN participants was run to compare the performance in the POEM test for correctly versus 
incorrectly identified OPID-10 odors. A logistic mixed effects model was used to estimate 
the probability of having a “yes” response on the POEM test, while controlling for the effect 
of correctly identifying each OPID-10 odor (yes versus no) and accounting for the 
correlation among POEM responses within each participant.

 Primary analyses of the proportions of correct responses in the OPID-20, OD, and POEM 
tests consisted of multiple logistic regression models that controlled for the following 
effects: diagnosis, age, gender, education level, and interactions between diagnosis and the 
covariates (age, gender, and education level). We then examined the interaction with the 
largest p-value (based on a global F test) and determined whether that p-value was less than 
0.1. If not, this interaction was removed and the model was re-fit. We continued in this 
manner until we had a final model that controlled for the effects of diagnosis, age, gender, 
education level, and interactions whose p-values (based on a global F test) were less than 
0.1.
For each proportion of correct responses in the OPID-20, OD, and POEM tests, we then 
conducted secondary analyses in two parts. In the first part, we fit a multiple logistic 
regression model for each proportion that controlled for the effects of: diagnosis, MMSE 
score (to control for overall cognition), the interaction between diagnosis and MMSE score, 
age, gender, education level, and the significant or marginally significant diagnosis 
interactions (with age, gender, or education level) that were identified in the primary analysis 
of that proportion. We then used a global F test to determine whether the interaction between 
diagnosis and MMSE score was significant at the 0.05 level or marginally significant at the 
0.1 level. If not, this interaction was removed and the model was re-fit. Using the same 
modeling approach, we then fit additional multiple logistic regression models for each 
proportion that controlled for the effects of each of the following five AD measures, and 
their interactions with diagnosis, in separate models: BNT score (to control for a naming 
deficit), OAS score (to control for olfactory awareness), CDR-SOB score (to control for 
overall function), Trails B time (to control for executive function required to perform the 
task), and APOE genotype (to control for genetic risk), which is a well-established risk 
factor for Alzheimer’s and has been reported to influence odor identification performance. 
Since no distributional assumptions are required for Trails B time as a covariate, it was not 
transformed in any of these models
In the second part of our secondary analyses, we fit a multiple logistic regression model for 
each proportion that controlled for the effects of: diagnosis, the AD measures and their 
interactions with diagnosis that had significant or marginally significant effects in the first 
part of our secondary analysis.
For significant main or interaction effects involving diagnosis in both the primary and 
secondary models for each proportion of correct responses in the OPID-20, OD, and POEM 
tests, we used Holm’s stepdown method to adjust p-values and the Bonferroni correction to 
adjust 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for multiple comparisons when assessing which pairs 
of diagnoses significantly differed from one another.
A subgroup analysis of CN participants was run to compare the performance in the POEM 
test for correctly versus incorrectly identified OPID-10 odors. A logistic mixed effects 
model was used to estimate the probability of having a “yes” response on the POEM test, 
while controlling for the effect of correctly identifying each OPID-10 odor (yes versus no) 
and accounting for the correlation among POEM responses within each participant.

 Cognitive trajectory score
For the cognitive trajectory measures, two groups were analyzed:
1.
Good POEM Performers (n=88): CN or SCC participants whose POEM 
Index was above the lower bound of the 50% confidence interval of 
expected POEM Index based on performance on both the OPID-20 and 
OD tests.
2.
Poor POEM Performers (n=24): CN or SCC participants whose POEM 
Index was below the lower bound of the 50% confidence interval of 
expected POEM Index based on performance on both the OPID-20 and 
OD tests.
The relationship between change in MMSE, LMII, DSC, and CVLT over time and our odor 
measures at baseline was modeled using linear mixed effects models with the known 
modifiers of age, gender, education, and time from baseline visit.
We ran subgroup analyses to compare the performance of good versus poor POEM 
performers. T-tests were used to compare OAS Sum Score and Trails B time (transformed) 
at the time of olfactory testing as well as volumetric imaging data and PiB retention between 
subgroups. Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were used to compare the following test scores at the 
time of olfactory testing between subgroups: CDR-SOB, MMSE, BNT, CVLT, and UPDRS. 
The chi-square tests and simple logistic modeling procedures as previously described were 
used to compare APOE genotype between subgroups, as well as the proportions of correct 
responses in the OPID-10, OPID-20, OD, and POEM tests. In modeling each olfactory 
measure and cognitive score, all statistical tests were conducted at the 0.05 significance 
level. In testing hypotheses of pairwise differences between diagnoses for a specific main or 
interaction effect, we adjusted our significance level of 0.05 for each hypothesis test to 
correct for multiple comparisons using the correction methods previously described.
All chi-square tests, t-tests, and ANOVA models were implemented in SPSS. Wilcoxon 
rank-sum and Kruskal-Wallis tests were implemented using proc npar1way in SAS Version 
9.4. All logistic regression models were implemented in R using the glm function in the stats 
package for generalized linear models with the logit link. Linear mixed models were fit 
using proc mixed in SAS Version 9.3.
RESULTS
Demographics of the Cohort
Mean education levels and OAS scores did not significantly differ between the CN, SCC, 
MCI, and AD participants at the time of olfactory testing, but age significantly differed 
across these diagnoses (Table 1). As expected, there were highly significant differences 
between all diagnoses for the CDR-SOB and Trails B tests at the time of olfactory testing 
(Table 1) as well as the frequency of the APOE ε4 allele. MMSE scores significantly 
differed between each pair of diagnoses, except between MCI and AD diagnoses (Table 1). 
BNT scores significantly differed between CN and AD participants (Table 1). Participants 
endorsing specific potential confounding factors during olfactory screening did not perform

 significantly differently on the olfactory battery (OD, OPID-10, OPID-20, POEM), the OAS, 
or NPT when compared to participants who denied these factors (data not shown); hence, all 
participants were retained for further analysis.
Identification of Odor Percepts
Using simple logistic modeling, we found that OPID-20 accuracy significantly differed 
between each pair of diagnoses (Table 2, Figure 2A). In addition, OPID-10 accuracy 
significantly differed between AD participants and those in the CN and SCC groups, and 
also between MCI participants and those in the CN and SCC groups (Table 2, Figure 2A).
In multiple regression models, and paralleling previous studies of a smell identification 
outcome and diagnosis (9, 23), we found that controlling for the effects of age, education, 
and gender, there were significant interactions between diagnosis and age (global p (p using 
global F test) < 0.0001), between diagnosis and gender (global p = 0.03), and between 
diagnosis and education level (global p = 0.04) on the proportion of correct trials for the 
OPID-20 test. The estimated log odds ratio (LOR) of correct identification for the SCC 
versus the MCI diagnoses for males was 0.658 less than that for females (adjusted p (p using 
Holm’s stepdown method) = 0.016, 95% CI: (−1.236,−0.081)). For every additional year of 
participant age, (1) the estimated LOR of correct identification for the SCC diagnosis 
compared with the AD diagnosis significantly decreases by 0.116 (adjusted p < 0.0001, 95% 
CI: (−0.179,−0.053)), (2) the estimated LOR of correct identification for the MCI diagnosis 
compared with the AD diagnosis significantly decreases by 0.122 (adjusted p < 0.0001, 95% 
CI: (−0.189,−0.055)), and (3) the estimated LOR of correct identification for the CN 
diagnosis compared with the AD diagnosis significantly decreases by 0.097 (adjusted p < 
0.0001, 95% CI: (−0.160,−0.034)). For every additional year of education, (1) the estimated 
LOR of correct identification for the MCI diagnosis compared with the CN diagnosis 
marginally significantly decreases by 0.117 (adjusted p = 0.068, 95% CI: (−0.24, 0.005)).
In the first part of our secondary analysis, we found that controlling for the effects of 
diagnosis, age, gender, and education, the main effect of OAS test score on the proportion of 
correctly identified trials in the OPID-20 test was significant (global p < 0.0001), along with 
the interactions between diagnosis and MMSE score (global p < 0.0001) and between 
diagnosis and Trails B time (global p < 0.0001).
In the second part of our secondary analysis, the main effect of OAS test score on the 
proportion of correctly identified trials in the OPID-20 test remained significant (global p < 
0.001), controlling for the effects of diagnosis, age, gender, education, MMSE score, and 
Trails B time. Due to significant interactions between diagnosis and MMSE score (global p 
< 0.0001), as well as diagnosis and Trails B time (global p<0.0001), the effects of MMSE 
and Trails B performance on the proportion of correctly identified trials in the OPID-20 test 
are significantly modified by diagnosis.
Percepts of Odor Episodic Memory (POEM)
Simple logistic regression modeling revealed significant differences in POEM test 
performance between AD participants and those in the CN and SCC groups (Table 2, Fig. 
2B). Significant main effects of diagnosis (global p = 0.003) and age (global p = 0.02) were

 revealed when multiple logistic regression was used to model the proportion of correct trials 
in the POEM test, controlling for the effects of gender and education. Relative to AD 
participants, (1) the log odds of correctly distinguishing previously presented odors were 
significantly higher by 0.556 (adjusted p = 0.002; 95% CI: (0.146,0.965)) for the CN group 
and by 0.435 (adjusted p = 0.022; 95% CI: (0.032,0.838)) for the SCC group. For a given 
diagnosis, gender and education level, the log odds of correct episodic recall decreased by 
0.01 (global p = 0.02; 95% CI: (−0.019, −0.002)) for every additional year of participant 
age.
In the first part of our secondary analysis, none of the six AD measures, or their interactions 
with diagnosis, had a significant or marginally significant effect on the proportion of correct 
trials in the POEM test, controlling for the effects of diagnosis, age, gender, and education. 
Therefore, we did not proceed to the second part of our secondary analysis. In addition, to 
determine whether correctly naming the odor in the OPID-10 affected the degree of 
encoding, i.e., no feedback was provided, we used a logistic mixed effects model to compare 
the proportion of correctly remembered odors in the POEM test stratified by whether they 
were correctly or incorrectly identified in the OPID-10. In 18 CN subjects, where the 
OPID-10 proportion correct was 0.5 or 0.6 to balance the number of correct and incorrect 
trials, no difference was noted (p = 0.45).
Odor Discrimination
Simple logistic regression modeling of the OD outcome showed significant differences in 
performance between the CN and AD diagnoses (Table 2, Fig. 2C). Modeling the proportion 
of trials with correct discrimination revealed significant main effects of diagnosis (global 
p=0.01) and age (global p = 0.0004) controlling for covariate effects. Relative to AD 
participants, the log odds of correct discrimination was significantly higher for the MCI 
group by 0.608 (adjusted p = 0.043, 95% CI: (0.00, 1.217)) and by 0.666 for the CN group 
(adjusted p = 0.011, 95% CI: (0.1, 1.232)), controlling for all other covariate effects. For a 
given diagnosis, gender and education level, the log odds of correct discrimination 
significantly decreased by 0.023 (global p = 0.0004, 95% CI: (−0.036,−0.011)) for every 
additional year of participant age.
In the first part of our secondary analysis, we found that controlling for the effects of 
diagnosis, age, gender, and education, the main effect of Trails B time on the proportion of 
trials with correct discrimination was significant (global p < 0.0001). In the second part of 
our secondary analysis, we found that the log odds of correct discrimination significantly 
decreased by 0.006 (global p = 0.0002, 95% CI: (−0.009,−0.003) with each unit increase in 
Trails B score, controlling for the effects of diagnosis, age, gender, and education.
Hippocampal Volume and Entorhinal Thickness, but not Amyloid Deposition, Correlate 
with OPID Performance
To adjust for the variable timing of high resolution MRI imaging relative to olfactory testing, 
in the subgroup of participants who underwent MRI imaging (n=49; 11 CN; 27 SCC; 9 
MCI; 2 AD), multiple linear regression models were fit with an interaction term for imaging 
timing x measurement (e.g. entorhinal thickness, adjusted bilateral hippocampal volume) in 
Albers et al.

 addition to imaging timing, and imaging measurement variables. None of the models were 
significant for imaging timing or the imaging timing/ measurement interaction term. When 
we control for the main effect of imaging timing, we find significant partial correlations 
between OPID-20 score and adjusted bilateral hippocampal volume (r = 0.534, p < 0.0001) 
(Fig. 3A) and entorhinal thickness (r = 0.321, p = 0.026), consistent with previous findings 
using the UPSIT (24). Significant partial correlations, adjusted for the main effect of 
imaging timing, were also observed between OPID-10 score and adjusted bilateral 
hippocampal volume(r = 0.323, p = 0.026) and entorhinal thickness (r = 0.313, p = 0.03). 
Performance on the POEM or OD tests did not significantly correlate with either volumetric 
measure in an unadjusted or adjusted analysis.
In the subgroup of participants who underwent amyloid PET imaging (n=41; 9 CN; 22 SCC; 
8 MCI; 2 AD), we found no significant correlations between FLR score and performance on 
the OD, OPID-20, or POEM tests across or within diagnoses. To adjust for the variable 
timing of amyloid-imaging relative to olfactory testing, in the subgroup of participants who 
underwent amyloid PET imaging, a multiple linear regression model was fit with an 
interaction term for imaging timing x measurement (e.g. FLR score) in addition to imaging 
timing, and FLR score variables. None of the models were significant for imaging timing or 
the imaging timing/ measurement interaction term. When we control for the main effect of 
the timing of amyloid imaging, we do not observe any statistically significant partial 
correlations between FLR score and any of the olfactory measures.
Identification of Poor POEM Performers (PPPs) among CN and SCC Participants
The episodic recognition of odors as previously (or not previously) presented in the 
OPID-20 is a complex task that relies on both the ability to discriminate and identify odor 
percepts. Consistent with this, performance on the POEM and the OD and OPID-20 tests 
were substantially correlated across our sample. We hypothesized that individuals who had 
pathophysiological changes in the olfactory/entorhinal cortical neural systems would 
perform less well on the episodic memory component relative to the identification and 
discrimination tasks, even early on in disease. In order to identify individuals with specific 
deficits in episodic memory of odor percepts, we developed two prediction models, one for 
POEM index as a function of the OPID-20, and another for POEM index as a function of 
OD. CN and SCC participants with POEM indices less than the lower bounds of the 50% 
confidence interval of the predicted scores from both of these models were identified as poor 
POEM performers (PPPs, n=24; 21%) and the remainder were identified as good POEM 
performers (n=88). This 50% threshold was based on our initial observations that POEM 
indices of the lowest quartile of CN participants approximated the range of values of the AD 
participants (whose performance was no better than chance).
Good performers and poor performers on the POEM test did not significantly differ from 
one another on their performance of the discrimination (78.2% correct vs. 77.4%, p=0.77) 
nor on other demographic variables, with the exception of the CVLT test (73.4% correct vs. 
66.4%, p=0.01). However, PPPs did perform significantly worse on the identification tasks 
(OPID-10: 70% correct vs. 58.8%, p=.001; OPID-20: 76.3% correct vs. 69.4%, p=0.002).

 Enrichment of APOE ε4 and Reduced Entorhinal Thickness in PPPs
We next examined biomarkers related to underlying AD related pathobiology in clinically 
normal individuals who were good versus poor POEM performers. Using a Pearson chi-
square analysis, PPPs were significantly more likely to carry the APOE ε4 allele than good 
POEM performers (p=0.011; φ = 0.25; Figure 4A). Entorhinal thickness in PPPs was 
marginally significantly decreased (p=0.098; d = 0.56; Figure 4B) relative to the good 
POEM performers. The time window between MRI scans and olfactory testing was not 
significantly different in the good and poor POEM performers (p=0.208). Mean adjusted 
bilateral hippocampal volume and PiB retention did not significantly differ between good 
POEM performers and PPPs, and PiB retention did not significantly correlate with the 
performance on the olfactory tests themselves. Moreover, no significant differences in FLR 
score were found between good and PPPs when it was considered as a continuous (p=0.423) 
or a binary outcome thresholded at FLR=1.2 (p=0.131). No significant difference was found 
in the length of the time between PiB imaging and olfactory testing in the good vs. poor 
POEM performers (p=0.188).
Worse Trajectory of Episodic Memory in Clinically Normal Individuals with Selective Odor 
Memory Loss
Based on our hypothesis of the predictive value of a selective episodic odor memory deficit 
(rather than a more global deficit in olfactory function), trajectories of MMSE, DSC, LM II, 
and CVLT and a composite score equally weighting all 4 tests (24) were modeled for all 
clinically normal participants (diagnosis = CN or SCC), who had 3 or more visits with 
available NPT (n=111). Participants with a selective odor memory deficit (PPPs, n=24) were 
compared with the remainder of this sample (good POEM performers, n=88). For CN and 
SCC participants with good POEM performance (i.e., commensurate with their performance 
on other odor tasks, as described above), all scores were modeled, since it could be inferred 
that these participants also had good POEM performance at their earlier visit dates. In 
additional analyses, we truncated the scores at the time of testing to assess 
neuropsychological test trajectories in a known state of good POEM performance. For PPPs, 
trajectories of cognitive scores were modeled from the time of olfactory testing and forward, 
since the POEM status of these participants at the earlier time points could not be inferred.
Consistent with the previously reported practice effect (25), the trajectory of LM II scores 
over time had a significant positive slope for the good POEM performing group (n=88, 
β=0.48, p<0.0001) (Table 3). By contrast, the trajectory of LM II score over time for the 
PPPs did not differ significantly from zero (n=24, β=−0.20, p=0.516), suggesting practice 
effect may have been absent in the group of subjects who showed selective impairments on 
the episodic olfactory memory test. Consistent with our hypothesis, the slopes of LMII 
scores over time for good POEM performers were significantly better (p=0.032) than poor 
POEM performers. Use of all longitudinal data for good POEM performers did not change 
any of these results. The trajectory of LM II scores for the CN/SCC participants in the 
lowest quartile of POEM index scores was significantly different (p=0.010) from the upper 
three quartiles of CN/SCC participants (n=88, β= 0.50, p<0.0001 vs. n=24, β=−0.28, 
p=0.368). By contrast, OAS (p=0.577), BNT (p=0.62), Trails-B (transformed) (p=0.92), and 
trajectories of MMSE (p=0.73), DSC (p= 0.78), and CVLT (p= 0.25) did not significantly

 differ between good and poor POEM performers. Analysis of prospective 
neuropsychological data from the time of olfactory testing did not show significant 
differences between the two groups (mean follow-up is 1.5 years). Taken together, these data 
indicate that selective poor performance on the POEM test (relative to the other olfactory 
measures) in clinically normal individuals is associated with a worse trajectory of LM II 
scores.
DISCUSSION
In this study, we demonstrate significant differences in OPID-20 performance between all 
diagnostic groups representing the spectrum of AD. Moreover, we find worse OPID 
performance is associated with reduced adjusted hippocampal volume and thinner entorhinal 
cortices, paralleling previous reports of significant relationships between the UPSIT and 
adjusted hippocampal volume and entorhinal volume (23, 26). We observe these associations 
in spite of the fact that the MRI imaging was performed an average of nearly two years prior 
to the olfactory testing. The lack of association between OPID and amyloid imaging may be 
due to the earlier date, on average, of the amyloid scans relative to olfactory testing. In 
secondary analyses, we find that the performance on the OPID-20 has multiple interactions 
with age, education, global cognition, executive functioning and the subject’s subjective 
awareness of odors as well as gender, the latter was previously reported for the UPSIT (27). 
No association was found between OPID-20 and APOE genotype. The OD measure 
discriminated less between the diagnostic categories — significantly differing only between 
individuals who were cognitively normal and who had AD dementia. The OD measure was 
also influenced by age, gender, education, and executive function. These multiple 
associations potentially complicate the interpretation of odor identification and odor 
discrimination deficits as a biomarker in clinically normal populations. Performance on our 
novel POEM index of odor memory is significantly different between both CN and SCC 
participants and patients with dementia. In contrast to the OPID and the OD, our secondary 
analyses reveal that the POEM index is only associated with age, the principal risk factor for 
sporadic AD – although these interaction tests may be underpowered. The AD patients 
perform at chance on this test of odor memory; the floor effect of the POEM tests suggests 
that it will not be useful to follow disease progression in the dementia stage of AD, but 
offers good dynamic range in the preclinical population.
While the lack of association of POEM with the other demographic and neuropsychological 
measures is promising as an independent AD biomarker, smell function measurements in 
normal participants vary over several orders of magnitude (28, 29). The mechanism(s) which 
influence this broad performance range likely relate to individual variations in genetics and 
physiology. We hypothesized that normalizing for each participant’s intrinsic olfactory 
function (based on their performance on the identification and discrimination tasks) would 
yield an olfactory-based episodic memory score with greater specificity for dysfunction of 
neural systems commonly impaired in early AD, namely the entorhinal cortex and dedicated 
olfactory processing regions (8). Indeed, clinically normal participants with observed odor 
memory scores below the scores predicted by both their odor identification and 
discrimination scores were enriched in three established AD biomarkers: APOE ε4 alleles, 
entorhinal cortical thinning, and worse trajectory on an episodic memory task. By contrast,

 clinically normal participants in the bottom quartile of OPID-20 performance were not 
enriched in any of these AD biomarkers, and the bottom quartile of POEM only had a worse 
cognitive trajectory. Both the presence of APOE ε4 allele and thinner entorhinal cortices are 
well accepted markers of risk for developing AD (30).
Limitations of our study include significant differences in age and gender across the 
diagnostic categories; we adjusted for these potential confounders in our multivariate logistic 
regression models. In addition, only a subset of our cohort had available biomarkers for 
amyloid deposition, entorhinal thickness, hippocampal volume, and APOE genotype. Many 
studies have found diminished smell identification performance in patients with Parkinson’s 
disease (PD) and in those at elevated risk for developing PD (11). In addition, patients with 
Lewy Body Dementia (LBD) also exhibit significant odor identification deficits (31). Future 
studies will be directed at determining the specificity of PPP in patients with symptomatic 
PD and LBD.
Following confirmation in longer prospective longitudinal analyses and in other cohorts, 
selective odor episodic odor memory loss, i.e. PPP status, may identify a subset of clinically 
normal participants at greater risk for developing the progressive memory symptoms of AD. 
Combining olfactory assessments (identification and POEM) with genetic, imaging, and 
molecular biomarkers for AD pathology may yield an enhanced AD risk profile (32) to 
identify clinically normal elderly participants, with an increased probability of cognitive 
decline in the next two years, for clinical trials. In addition, olfactory assessments are 
inexpensive and well-tolerated, so they might play an important role in cost-effective 
screening for preclinical AD in the general population.

Schematics of Olfactory Tests. (A) 10-item Qdor Percept IDentification (OPID-10) test: The 
participant was cued on each trial by the software to prepare to sniff bilaterally and sample 
the 2 s delivery of an odor. Following odor presentation, participants were asked if they were 
familiar with the odor (Yes/No). During the instruction phase of the test, the research 
assistant explicitly indicated that familiarity with the odor percept did not require a semantic 
label. Following the odor familiarity response, participants were presented with 4 odor 
names and asked to choose which odor name associated with their memory of the odor 
percept experienced at the start of the trial. (B) 20-item percept of odor episodic memory 
(POEM) and identification (OPID-20) tests were administered after a 10 minute delay. Odor 
presentation is as described for the OPID-10. Immediately following odor presentation, 
participants were asked if the odor had been presented in the earlier odor percept 
identification test (Yes/No). During the instruction phase of the test, the research assistant 
explicitly indicated that New/Old designation referred to the testing session and not to a 
broader lifetime exposure. Following this measure of episodic odor percept memory, the 
naming is as described in A. (C) The 12-item odor discrimination (OD) test. The participant

LM II z scores calculated for CN/SCC participants that underwent olfactory testing once and had over 3 years of annual neuropsychological testing. Model 1 uses NP scores up until time of olfactory testing 
in the good POEM performers and deletes remaining data. Model 2 uses NP scores beginning at time of olfactory testing in poor POEM performers (PPP). Abbreviations: MMSE = mini mental status 
examination. LM2 = delayed recall of logical memory test.
