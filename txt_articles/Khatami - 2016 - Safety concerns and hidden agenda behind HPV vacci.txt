COMMENTARY
Safety concerns and hidden agenda 
behind HPV vaccines: another generation 
of drug-dependent society?
Mahin Khatami*
Abstract 
Analyses of data and hidden agenda behind repeated failed outcomes of cancer research and therapy, status of 
American health, safety concerns for HPV vaccines and future research considerations are summarized in this com-
mentary. A closer look at cancer science reveals that highly power structure (system) in medical establishment vs. 
anti-system and chaos in cancer research (‘medical/scientific ponzi schemes’) is potent recipe for failed therapeutics 
that kills patients but generates huge corporate profit. American health status ranks last among other developed 
nations despite the highest amount that USA invests in healthcare. This is a wake-up call to make sure that the evil 
part of human being does not prevent the health services that the public deserves. Otherwise, ‘it does not matter how 
many resources you have, if you don’t know, or don’t want to know, how to use them, they will never be enough’. Answer 
to cancer and improved public health is possible only by switching the current corruptive and abusive culture of 
‘who you know’ to a culture of ‘what you know’. Policy makers and professionals in decision making roles are urged to 
return to common sense and logics that our Forefathers used to serve the public.

Matrix of power in cancer establishment: creation 
of cancer‑stricken society‑chaos in research 
and therapy for huge profit
‘Those who have the privilege to know, have the duty 
to act.’ Albert Einstein
Formation of a highly ordered and sophisticated medi-
cal hierarchy (establishment) in the nineteenth/twentieth 
century within higher education institutions (e.g., medi-
cal schools, organizations) was supported by business-
men and philanthropists with motives to profit from the 
sale of drugs (reviewed in 1). The power of establishment 
grew since 1955 when public was intentionally inoculated 
with million doses of virus-contaminated polio vaccines, 
which sharply increased the deadly cancer incidence in 
the current ‘baby boomers’ generation, particularly in 
America. In addition to increased cancer incidence and 
mortality, numerous other disabling acute or chronic ill-
nesses [e.g., poliomyelitis, vasculitis, autoimmune and 
neurodegenerative diseases or vaccine-associated para-
lytic polio (VAPP)] are reported as the results of public 
vaccination with virus-contaminated polio vaccines that

made American health status at the bottom of other 
healthy nations [1–3].1, 2, 3, 4, 5 The abusive power of 
establishment intensified since 1971, when the Cancer 
Act, signed by President Nixon, increased cancer 
research funding of National Cancer Institute (NCI)/NIH 
to 1.6 B, so that cancer problem be solved in 8 years! The 
establishment has been successful in collecting/spending 
several trillions of dollars from public and private 
resources ($1.6 trillion spent in 2008 alone on research, 
drug development, clinical trials and care) with claims of 
‘targeted’ therapy, ‘precision’ or ‘personalized’ medicine, 
including the recent failed attempts for ‘immunotherapy’ 
[1].
In addition to surgery, current treatments options 
(chemotherapies) primarily use potent apoptotic factors, 
specific growth factor inhibitors (monoclonal antibod-
ies), stem cell transfer, or inhibit check point proteins 
of T cells or genetic mutations of PDs in monocytes and 
claims of immunotherapy [1]. Treatments are often com-
bined with partial or total body irradiation (radiother-
apy). These clinical approaches induce ‘immune tsunami’ 
or ‘cytokine storm’ in an already immune compromised 
body of patients and destroy integrity and function of 
vital organs such as the liver, kidneys, bone, muscle and 
vasculature resulting in life-threatening side effects [e.g., 
drug-resistant and relapse, cachexia, sarcopenia, fatigue, 
thromboembolism and multiple organ failure (MOF)] 
and loss of lives [1, 4–8]. Such highly toxic treatments 
resemble the severe reactions that are described for 
potent pathogen-induced acute inflammatory diseases 
and rapid generation of cytokine storm in such diseases 
as sepsis, meningitis, salmonella poisoning, pneumonia 
or major trauma often leading to MOF or death [1, 4, 5].
Therefore, there is no surprise that outcomes of such 
illogical approaches (‘medical/scientific ponzi schemes’) 
have failure rates of 90% (±5) for solid tumors [1, 4, 5].
War on cancer is a very expensive Government Welfare 
Program for members of the establishment and their sur-
rogates who enjoy career longevities of 40–65 years and 
who are entitled to continuously receive large sums of 
travel funds and grants with little/no review processes or

producing anything of value to benefit the society [1].6 In 
2013, American Association for Cancer Research (AACR, 
strong lobbying group, established in 1907) shamelessly 
boasted that 1/3 (33%) of all women, and 1/2 (50%) of all 
men develop cancer in their lives and that they need 
more money to ‘Stand Up To Cancer’!
The establishment is entitled to glamorize and publi-
cize too many drugs or vaccines with little/no ethical or 
safety considerations for short-, or long-term health 
hazards of such projects. Policy makers in Congress 
have no clues how to assess worthy or worthless pro-
jects as they depend on advice of members of establish-
ment and their surrogates who occupy high positions 
and scientific recognitions, including Nobel prizes, as 
the only ‘authorities’ to defend such illogical projects 
that are more like ‘building too many expensive bridges 
to nowhere’; and identifying ‘molecular false flags’ based 
on false foundations [1, 5].7 The establishment tolerates 
no challenge or objection from competent and inde-
pendent scientists. Independent professional views are 
perceived as ‘threat’ to the establishment and profes-
sionals become subjected to heavy harassment, bully-
ing, unethical and criminal practices of retaliation and 
elimination [1].
With the availability of modern technologies, decision 
makers in the government, academia or Big pharma 
become narrowly experts in their fields of ‘omics’ (e.g., 
genomic, proteomic, lipidomic, glycomic, metabolomic) 
and know details of structures and substructures of 
viruses, bacteria, parasites (microbiotics), carcinogens 
and endless broken/defective molecules (e.g., somatic 
mutations of growth or apoptotic factors, enzymes, recep-
tors) or how to inhibit them in experimental models of 
tumors or clinical trials [1, 4, 5]. However, cancer remains 
an imaginary problem (‘it is too many diseases’) to solve. 
Public deception on cancer science reminds us of the 
statement of Philip Zelikow ‘The creation and mainte-
nance of public myths exert a powerful influence’ [1].8
Lack of oversight and accountability and abuse of funds on too many 
failed projects made cancer research a myth making machine by ‘intel-
lectuals’ who portray cancer as too difficult a problem to solve!

With hundreds of thousands of disturbances in network 
of molecular, neuronal, immunological, vascular, metabolic, 
bioenergetics, physical and mechanical properties that are 
present in cancer molecular tsunami, who could ever claim 
that inhibiting one or two or 10 molecules would correct or 
treat any solid tumor? (Fig. 1) [1, 4, 5, 8–10].9,10,11
These ‘specialists’ whose career longevity depends on 
defending such worthless projects remind us of Rumi’s 
spiritual statement that ‘People cannot see the camel in the 
minaret but they can see the hair in its nose!’12
Peyton Rous said it best that ‘A hypothesis is best 
known by its fruits. What have been those of the 
somatic mutation hypothesis? It has resulted in no 
good thing as concerns the cancer problem, but in 
much that is bad… Most serious of all the results of 
the somatic mutation hypothesis has been its effect 
on research workers. It acts as a tranquilizer on those 
who believe in it.
’ This statement was made in 1959, 
well before genetic studies in cancer and claimed 
‘targeted’ therapies were put on steroids! [1, 4].13
Loss of patients lives, particularly the loss of politicians 
and celebrities or their families seem to be great incen-
tives for cancer establishment and its world’s largest lob-
bying group to go before Congress and claim that they 
made ‘remarkable achievements’ but need ‘more money’ 
to continue! It is outrageous that even after patients lose 
their lives to toxicities of drugs, money is collected in lieu 
of ‘flowers’
, or the victims leave small or large fortunes in 
their ‘wills’ to help ‘cancer research!’
There is a peculiar absence of systematic investigation to 
logically understand what triggers initial events in the loss 
of immunity (immune surveillance) originally described 
by Burnet in 1957 [1]. Except for ‘accidental’ discoveries 
that our research team established in 1980s on models of 
acute and chronic inflammation, there is little/no evidence 
on early stages of immune dysfunction toward multistep 
tumorigenesis and angiogenesis, although numerous cir-
cumstantial evidence on a role for inflammation in cancer

have been documented. In 1980s we were not involved in 
cancer research and had no idea of the importance or sig-
nificance of the findings for cancer research until I joined 
NCI/NIH in 1998. Analyses of data provided the first 
series of evidence for a direct link between inflammation 
and initial immune response alterations including the first 
report on sequential interactions and synergies between 
host immune and non-immune cells and those of activated 
recruiting inflammatory cells in the direction of tumo-
rigenesis and angiogenesis [1, 4, 5]. We further defined 
effective immunity as the balance between two tightly reg-
ulated and biologically opposing arms of Yin (tumoricidal, 
growth-arrest) and Yang (tumorigenic, growth-promote) 
of acute inflammation, an amazingly successful network 
of biological signals from immune and non-immune sys-
tems (e.g., vasculature, neuronal, metabolic, hormonal 
activities) for protecting the body against all intrinsic and 
extrinsic elements that are perceived harmful to body’s 
survival throughout life [9, 10].
Safety concerns and hidden agenda for publicizing 
HPV vaccines: abuse of affordable care insurance 
and moonshot initiative: creating another 
drug‑dependent sick society?
On September 7, 2016, NCI presented a document “Can-
cer Moonshot’s Blue Ribbon Panel” to National Cancer 
Advisory Board. It identified 10 priorities for cancer 
research including HPV vaccination. The document 
rehashes the same fuzzy approaches that have been used 
in the last six decades for cancer research and therapy or 
vaccines with different spins [1].14 The document 
reminds us of the tactics that were used in 1970s by CDC 
director for urgently seeking extra fund for swine flu vac-
cination. Review of an interesting article “The Swine Flu 
Affair” [11] resembles the scenario that establishment 
described for targeting young population for HPV or 
meningitis vaccines and justifying additional funding.
A wide range of vaccine-related health problems includ-
ing autism (measles vaccines), multiple sclerosis (hepatitis 
B), menangioencephalitis (Japanese encephalitis), Guil-
lian-Barre syndrome and giant cell arthritis (influenza), 
encephalomyelitis (semple rabies), neurological problems 
(e.g., H1N1, swine flu) have been reported in literature. 
The total number of death and diseases that were caused 
by polio, swine flu and other specific vaccines, even BCG 
vaccines are greater than diseases these vaccines were

intended to prevent [1, 12–14].15 The rush for HPV vacci-
nation is no exception as described below.
Human papilloma viruses (HPVs) are small heteroge-
neous family of at least 130 different viruses (HPV types) 
of double-stranded DNA whose potencies and genomic 
structures evolve in host and are different from individ-
ual to individual, tissue to tissue and time to time. HPVs 
have been identified in organs/tissues (e.g., skin, larynx, 
vagina, penis, esophagus, conjunctiva, bronchus, parana-
sal sinuses, tracheo-bronchial and oral mucosa, anogeni-
tal tract, urethra) in diseases such as genital warts, 
recurrent respiratory papillomatosis, low-grade and 
high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (SILs) and 
anal, vaginal and cervical cancers [1, 15–17].16

Emphases on production of specific vaccines to inac-
tivate segments of viral structures such as HPVs DNA 
structures or expression products, while not effec-
tive to prevent specific diseases (e.g., cervical can-
cers), long-term effects of HPV vaccines (Gardasil™, 
or Cervarix™) could contribute to initiation of health 
problems during aging, if not sooner. The genomic 
structures of HPVs in vaccines (e.g., inactivated high 
potency particles) could disturb host tissues in a 
variety of mechanisms (e.g., mutations of DNA com-
ponents or integration into host chromosomes and 
instability of genomic substructures). Exposure to viral 
particles and adjuvant (aluminum) in vaccines, along 
with routine exposures to other immune disruptors 
are ‘antigen overload’ for immune system that could 
shift the induction of chronic health problems (e.g., 
increased asthma, ocular or skin allergies, hot flashes, 
gastrointestinal conditions or neurological and auto-
immune diseases) that are features of aging to younger 
individuals [1, 18, 19].

Professionals and policy makers in other countries 
started raising serious questions about the “scientific 
uncertainties related to the safety of HPV vaccines…
Sloppy science, combined with unprofessional and unfair 
criticism of independent research, such as the one the 
EMA raised against the diligent Danish researchers, is a 
serious threat to scientific progress and public health…
”

Recent clinical data already suggest adverse effects of 
HPV vaccines, composed of genotype-specific capsid 
proteins variations (e.g., HPV-16, HPV-6 or HPV-11) or 
expression of detectable HPVL1 protein and DNA frag-
ments in aluminum-containing adjuvant, of virus-like-
particles-VLPs by DNA recombinant methodologies [15, 
16].18
We suggested that exposures to specific virus-con-
taining vaccines, by inhibiting/inactivating specific high 
risks (‘potent’) segments of viral DNA lead to inflam-
matory conditions that would influence the homeostasis 
and dynamics (ecosystem) of host microorganisms (e.g., 
GI track, skin) in young adults. Altering hazard/benefit 
ratios of microbiota are important contributing factors 
in ‘antigen overload’ for immunity and cross reactivity 
of antibodies against antiviral immune complexes and 
induction of age-like chronic diseases in younger adults. 
Our observations that newborn guinea pigs born from 
sensitized parents showed strong allergic reactions upon 
1st or 2nd challenge with antigen, suggesting genetic pre-
disposition of fetus [1, 4, 5] are indirectly supported by 
clinical data [1, 18, 19].
Again, a great deal of investment have been directed 
to identify details of structures and substructures of 
microorganisms, carcinogens or expression products 
and mechanisms of actions of evolving numerous infec-
tive agents [e.g., HPV, polio, rous sarcoma, herpes, AIDS, 
EBOLA, influenza, measles, hepatitis (A, B and C), LPS, 
meningitis or Zika]. However, what initiates altered tis-
sue response dynamics toward multistep diseases or can-
cers remains a mystery [1, 11–17].
The hidden short- and long-term agenda behind mak-
ing HPV or meningitis vaccination as priority projects 
seem the availability of funds through Obamacare insur-
ance and Moonshot Initiative. There should be no sur-
prise that the cost of individual insurance keeps going up.

Sixty-nine cancer centers urged HPV vaccination and 
thus-far, 80 million doses of HPV vaccines ($200–260/
dose) consumed by healthy public [1].19,20
It is painful to project that the sick status of ‘baby 
boomers’
, created half a century ago could be repeated, if 
not already started, by vaccinating the public with HPV 
or other vaccines (e.g., meningitis, shingles, flu), whether 
or not vaccines are contaminated with live viruses. Such 
fraud approaches could present grave health conse-
quences for future generation (s), if the policy makers, 
professionals and public do not reflect on the fact that 
‘intellectuals’ in health system who were responsible for 
improving public health are destroying it.
Future considerations: use of common sense 
to advance cancer science and effective vaccines 
for healthier society
Like cancerous cells, allergen and pathogenic compo-
nents in vaccines are intrinsic or extrinsic foreign enti-
ties to be neutralized and cleared or ignored by effective 
immunity. Microorganisms and defective cancerous 
cells co-exist in the highly ordered multilayered cellular 
organization of host as long as their numbers or poten-
cies do not overwhelm the complex defense mechanisms, 
the balance in Yin and Yang of self-terminating proper-
ties of acute inflammation. However, effective immunity 
can be weakened or lost by frequent exposures to bio-
logical and environmental hazards, particularly during 
aging process. Suppressed immunity (sustained oxidative 
stress) provides opportunities for pathogens or cancer-
ous cells to cause damage to host immune dynamics and 
initiation of health conditions such as allergies or other 
inflammatory diseases or cancers [1, 4, 5, 9, 10, 19].
We recently presented evidence-based interrelated 
hypotheses that cancer is a severe and cumulative delayed 
type hypersensitivity reaction in site-specific tissues [1, 
19]. Histamine, at low circulating level was suggested as 
blueprint for maintaining oxidative stress that contrib-
utes to tissue necrosis or growth in immune-privileged 
or immune-responsive tissues and induction of neuro-
logical or autoimmune diseases or tissue growth promo-
tion. Histamine, an alkaline, contributes to dysfunction 
of mitochondrial and ribosomal activities (mitophagy 
and autophagy), tissue acid–base balance and bioenerget-
ics (e.g., adenosine, ATP/ADP/AMP, Ca+2, H+/Na+/K+ 
transporters and exchangers), membrane structures (e.g.,

receptor or surface molecules, ionic and water channels). 
Among key components for future understanding of the 
effective immunity are the crucial roles that mitochon-
dria and autophagy play in maintenance of Yin-Yang and 
energy-dependent events in protein/lipid recycling and 
biosynthesis of structural proteins (e.g., metabolism of 
branched amino acids) involved in architectural integrity 
of tissue anchoring and contact inhibition [1, 5, 19, 20].
Designs of universal vaccines, or prophylactic candi-
dates that would generally enhance/promote or stabilize 
the innate immune cells (e.g., mast, dendritic and natu-
ral killer cells or macrophages) could also influence rest-
ing capability of adaptive immune cells (e.g., T and B/
plasma cell polarities) and corresponding crosstalk with 
non-immune systems. Pathogen-(stimuli) induced early 
alterations in immune dynamics are likely reversible, pre-
ventable/correctable or druggable (Fig. 2) [1, 5, 10, 19]. 
Logical efforts for therapies or vaccines are intellectually 
challenging, particularly because after investing trillions 
of dollars on too many worthless projects, we know very 
little on early molecular dynamics that alter response 
dynamics of site-specific tissues toward genesis of dis-
eases. Careful designs of logical studies are anticipated to 
lead to identification of suitable disease markers, accurate 
formulation of risk assessment and cost-effective transla-
tional medicine toward a healthier society that the public 
deserves.
Concluding remarks
For over a century all directors of NIH and other govern-
mental health agencies, cancer centers and organizations, 
medical schools, Big Pharma and food industry (produc-
ers of genetically modified organisms/GMOs) have been 
physicians (with MD degrees). The only formal duty of

these leaders was to improve and promote public health, 
prevent diseases and save American lives. However, 
despite excessive investment of American resources for 
healthcare the opposite has occurred. American health 
ranks last of 11 or last of 17, compared with other devel-
oped nations. Majority of vaccines that were designed to 
prevent diseases caused more death and diseases than 
public exposures to infective agents.
Policy makers and public should take a closer look at 
the long-lasting ‘medical/scientific ponzi schemes’ that 
cancer establishment created to control a drug-depend-
ent sick society. Millions of cancer patients who enter 
clinical trials are treated with drugs (poisons) and pro-
cedures that postpone their death-sentence for short 
duration, while their resources (insurance and personal 
assets) are drained! In this medical ponzi scheme, not 
only trillions of dollars wasted on ‘molecular false flags’
, 
but millions of precious lives were lost to such illegal, 
unethical and horrendous crimes against humanity.
Instead of using common sense to promote health and 
prevent or delay the onset of age-associated diseases, 
medical establishment has managed to gradually alter 
and destroy the natural immunity of Americans public 
and shift onset of diseases to younger age for increasing 
the population of sick people and pushing drug sale.
This is a wake-up call to make sure that the evil part 
of human being does not prevent the health services that 
the public deserves.
Answer to cancer and increased public health is pos-
sible only if policy makers and cancer-stricken public 
seriously realize that the might of establishment over the 
right of science must be drastically reversed.
Decision makers in Congress who appropriate funds 
and those who direct medical sciences, should return to 
the forgotten values of common sense and logics that our 
Forefathers used for serving the public. After all ‘we may 
be intelligent, but if not able to think and love well being of 
others, we use the intelligence against humanity’
