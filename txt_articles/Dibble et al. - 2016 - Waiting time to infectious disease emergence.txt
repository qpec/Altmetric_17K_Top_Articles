Emerging diseases must make a transition from stuttering chains of trans-
mission to sustained chains of transmission, but this critical transition need
not coincide with the system becoming supercritical. That is, the introduction
of infection to a supercritical system results in a significant fraction of the popu-
lation becoming infected only with a certain probability. Understanding the
waiting time to the first major outbreak of an emerging disease is then more
complicated than determining when the system becomes supercritical. We
treat emergence as a dynamic bifurcation, and use the concept of bifurcation
delay to understand the time to emergence after a system becomes supercritical.
Specifically, we consider an SIR model with a time-varying transmission term
and random infections originating from outside the population. We derive an
analytic density function for the delay times and find it to be, in general, in
agreement with stochastic simulations. We find the key parameters to be the
rate of introduction of infection and the rate of change of the basic reproductive
ratio. These findings aid our understanding of real emergence events, and can
be incorporated into early-warning systems aimed at forecasting disease risk.
1. Introduction
The emergence and re-emergence of infectious diseases is an enormous concern
to global public health. Nearly 70% of emerging human diseases have zoonotic
origins [1–3], including SARS [4], MERS [5], AIDS [6,7] and Ebola [8]. Similarly,
the re-emergence of previously controlled or eradicated diseases, including vac-
cine-preventable diseases such as measles [9] and pertussis [10], continues to be
a health and economic burden [11]. Owing to factors including reductions in
vaccine uptake [12], pathogen evolution [13] or changes in host demography
[14], emerging and re-emerging diseases make a transition from self-limiting,
stuttering chains of infection (which inevitably go extinct), to sustained
chains of human-to-human transmission (major outbreaks or epidemics). This
critical transition becomes possible when the average number of infections
caused by a single infectious individual in an entirely susceptible population
(called R0) becomes greater than 1—at this point the population is often referred
to as supercritical [15,16]. Forecasting this critical transition is the goal of early-
warning systems [17–19] of disease emergence [12]. In addition to knowing
when a population will become supercritical [12], accurate forecasting also
requires estimating the time of the first major outbreak or epidemic of a
newly emerging or re-emerging disease. Crucially, major outbreaks do not
happen immediately after R0 ¼ 1. Rather, they occur with some non-zero
delay—for which we do not yet have an adequate theory.
Waiting times between criticality and emergence imply that host populations
may be at risk of a major outbreak for an extended period of time, despite experi-
encing onlysmall clusters of cases (figure 1). In this way, a substantial waiting time
hides the true state of a system, inhibiting our ability to intervene in response to a

 large, but obscured, threat. Furthermore, long waiting times in
disease re-emergence could mean that reversing the driver of
a critical transition to its pre-outbreak levels might not push a
pathogen’s R0 below 1. For instance, if reductions in vaccine
uptake facilitate disease outbreaks (e.g. measles [20–22]),
increasing coverage to vaccination levels that existed immedi-
ately prior to an outbreak may not reduce R0 below 1, because
the transition to R0 . 1 could have occurred well before the
first major outbreak. An improved understanding of the factors
determining the waiting time to a major disease outbreak will
facilitate epidemic forecasting.
To better relate the transition to disease emergence and the
timing of major outbreaks and epidemics, we developed a
model incorporating a time-varying transmission term and the
acquisition of infections from outside the population. For this
model, we derive an approximate density function of waiting
times. For validation, this approximation is compared with sto-
chastic simulations across a wide range of notional life-history
parameters. Together, these results show that waiting times
can be described by a two-dimensional distribution encapsulat-
ing the rate of infections from outside the population and the
rate of change of R0. We discuss implications of our results for
early-warning systems of infectious disease emergence.
2. Material and methods
2.1 Main model and concepts
Let X denote the number of susceptible individuals in the popu-
lation; Y, the number of infective individuals; Z, the number
of recovered individuals; b, the transmission rate; g, the indivi-
dual recovery rate; m, the individual birth and death rate
(assumed here to be equal) and j, the rate at which infections
are spontaneously acquired from outside the population. The
transmission rate is 0 until time s, at which point it increases lin-
early at a small rate a. That is, for t . s, b ¼ at. Our main model
is the continuous-time Markov chain with the time-dependent
rates given in table 1.
For our model, we consider only the case that (1 � j . 0).
This case is of interest because in most disease emergence scen-
arios, there is a small influx of infectious individuals from
outside the focal population—for example, due to zoonotic spil-
lover events [23] or periodic importations of a disease from an
endemic location [21]. Because of this influx, the expected
number infected is necessarily greater than zero. However, the
order of the expected number of cases changes qualitatively as
the basic reproductive ratio passes through 1. The basic repro-
ductive ratio is the expected number of new infections caused
by an infected individual in an otherwise susceptible popula-
tion, which for our model equals R0 ¼ b(N � 1)=(g þ m) , where
N ¼ X þ Y þ Z. For R0 , 1, the expected number infected is of
order jN, whereas for R0 . 1 the expected number is of order
N. In other words, the expected number infected is approxi-
mately 1/j times larger when R0 . 1 compared with when
R0 , 1. The transition from one order of magnitude to another
may be referred to as an imperfect bifurcation, and the delay
between this event and the time when R0 ¼ 1 is known as a
bifurcation delay. Our goal is to find the model parameters that
largely control this delay. As we shall see, they turn out to be

Figure 1. Bifurcation delay is the time between the tipping point at R0 ¼ 1 (intersection of grey horizontal line and blue vertical line) and the beginning of an
actual disease epidemic (orange vertical line, definition in text). This simulated time series is a stochastic realization of the hinge SIR model, where the transmission
rate (b) begins to increase at a set time (here, t ¼ 5 years) at rate a. This example contains multiple ‘sparks’ after the transition to supercriticality that do not lead
to epidemics, demonstrating that bifurcation delay is not simply the waiting time for a spark to occur after R0 . 1. Other parameters for this simulation: rate of
increase in transmission, a ¼ 0.001 yr21, initial population size (N0) ¼ 1000, recovery rate, g ¼ 365/14 yr21 (corresponding to a 14 day infectious period),
spontaneous infection rate, j ¼ 0.00067 yr21, birth and death rate, m ¼ 1/60 yr21. (Online version in colour.)

 the rate of infection from outside of the population, which we call
the sparking rate, and the rate of change of R0, which we call the
sweep rate.
The results of this work are based on stochastic models
for two reasons. First, an analysis of deterministic bifurcation
delay in a model similar to a deterministic SIR model is
already available [24]. Second, the number of infectious individ-
uals prior to disease emergence may be small, and thus it may
not be appropriate to neglect stochastic effects. We study our
stochastic model and extensions of it using both simulation
and analysis.
2.2. Simulation
Our simulation model extends our main model by including
additional sources of demographic stochasticity. We make
three modelling decisions to allow demographic stochasticity
to have a substantial effect on delay times. First, the rate of
birth in our model is always equal to the rate of death. Thus,
the population size has no positive steady state, and the
variance of the population size across multiple realizations of
the model with the same initial population size increases over
time. Second, the timing (s) of the increase in the transmission
rate was set to year 100 to allow the variance to grow before the
approach to the critical point even began. Third, the trans-
mission rate is density dependent so that R0 varies with
fluctuations in population size (table 3). Although frequency-
dependent transmission is the better supported model for
many diseases of interest [25,26], the direct effect of demo-
graphic stochasticity on density-dependent transmission makes
it more likely to cause behaviour different from our analytic
model. As the purpose of the simulation was to investigate
such behaviour, and essentially ‘stress test’ the analytic results,
we present results based on density-dependent transmission
in the main text. A comparison of these results with those of
a frequency-dependent model is included in the electronic
supplementary material.
To calculate bifurcation delays in our simulation models,
we first simulated trajectories of the number infected using
Gillespie’s direct method [27]. These simulations are not exact
because the algorithm only updates the time-dependent rates at
the time when state-variables are updated, but for our par-
ameters updates should happen frequently enough that the
simulations remain highly accurate. We parametrized models
based roughly on the human lifespan, with a range of life-history
parameters that correspond to several disease systems of emer-
gence concern (table 2). To explore the range of possible
solutions to the stochastic model, we ran 1000 stochastic simu-
lations
for
each
combination
of
parameter
values.
Each
simulation ended at the first major outbreak, which occurred
when three criteria were satisfied: (A) the size of the susceptible
population was reduced below N/R0 (after

(R0 � 1) . 1, as it
is difficult to distinguish epidemics from small outbreaks when
R0 is only just above 1), (B) at least 15% of the population was
in the recovered class, and (C) at least 2.5% of the population
was infected. These criteria ensured that the disease had sur-

equilibrium
number of susceptible individuals (N/R0) (i.e. a major outbreak
occurred, A), that a substantial portion of the population had
been exposed to the disease (B) and that the population was
experiencing an active outbreak (C). We quantified bifurcation
delay as the time between the deterministic tipping point of
the system (calculated as the expected time when R0 ¼ 1, based
on the initial population size N0 and time-varying transmission
rate b, table 3) and the last time point with 0 infectious individ-
uals before the actual bifurcation (e.g. figure 1). To determine
whether longer delays make outbreaks larger when they even-
tually occur, we also recorded the peak epidemic prevalence in
each simulation.
2.3. Analysis
Our analytic model explores the effect on delay of the degree of
heterogeneity in secondary cases. The degree of heterogeneity of
secondary cases summarizes the consequences of heterogeneities
in susceptibility, infectivity, infectious periods and contact rates.
For the sake of tractability, our analytic model does not allow for
demographic stochasticity in the same manner as our simu-
lations. Our main approach is to suppose that each imported
infection initiates a chain of infections which may be modelled
as a branching process. The delay time is considered to be the
time before the initiation of a branching process that does not
go extinct. This time is a random variable that may be modelled
like the time to death in a survival analysis. In the following, we
derive a survival function for this time that is the basis for
equations for the mean and median times given in Results.
A branching process model can be used to calculate a prob-
ability of a major outbreak that accounts for the level of
heterogeneity of a given disease system. The branching process
we use models the number of cases in each generation as the
sum of the random number of secondary cases that are caused
by each case in the previous generation. Following previous
authors [28], we suppose that the secondary cases are drawn
from a negative binomial distribution. The theory of branching
processes then tells us that when the expected number of second-
ary cases is greater than 1, the probability of extinction is the
smallest root of the equation

 where R0 is the mean and k the overdispersion parameter of the
negative binomial distribution. The parameter k allows us to tune
the level of heterogeneity in the distribution of secondary cases.
As k ! 1, the negative binomial distribution approaches a
Poisson distribution, and as k ! 0 the distribution becomes
more overdispersed. For the case k ¼ 1, we recover the equation
that results from the assumption that cases occur at constant rate
over the duration of an exponentially distributed infectious
period [29]. Although equation (2.1) does not, in general, provide
a closed-form equation for the extinction probability, numeri-
cally finding the smallest root of equation (2.1) is trivial. The
probability of a major outbreak follows immediately as the
complement of the extinction probability.
To provide a more readily understandable equation for
the extinction probability, we introduce the approximation
Pr (extinction) � 1=Rp
0, where p is chosen based on k. Electronic
supplementary material, figure S1 shows the accuracy of this
approximation for range of k and p. We can see that for k , 1,
p � k often has a maximum error of less than 0.1. As expected
for k and p both equal to one, the calculated error is small and
reflects rounding error. For k . 4, p � 2 typically leads to a maxi-
mum error of less than 0.05. This approximation facilitates the
following analysis.
Given a model for the parameters of the branching process,
many equations describing the distribution of delay times
follow readily from standard survival analysis. We first consi-
der the model in which R0 ¼ 1 at time zero and then increases
linearly. For this model, the hazard function l for a major
outbreak is given by
lðtÞ ¼ a½1 � ð1 þ btÞ�p�,
ð2:2Þ
where a istherate at which infections occur due to contact with other
populationsand b istherate of change of R0 with respectto time. The
parameters a and b are the sparking and sweep rates mentioned ear-
lier. Our hazard function employs the previous approximation by
letting the probability of a major outbreak, given a spark, be equal
to 1 � R0(t)�p. The cumulative hazard is given by

time at which the probability of emergence having occurred
equals F, may be found by solving 1 2 F ¼ S(q) for q. The
median delay time is equal to q when F ¼ 1/2.
2.4. Comparison of analytic and simulated delay
distributions
To assess the agreement between analytic and simulation results,
we
calculated
the
Kullback–Leibler
(KL)
divergence
[30]
between analytic and simulated distributions of bifurcation
delay for all parameter combinations (N ¼ 7200, with 1000 simu-
lations generating each simulated distribution). KL divergence
quantifies the amount of information lost (i.e. entropy) when
approximating one distribution with another [30,31]. The KL
divergence of the distribution with density p from that with
density q is defined as DKL ¼
Ð 1
�1 p(x) log2( p(x)=q(x)) dx. We
calculated KL divergence using the entropy R package [32].
For the results presented, we used the analytic density function
for p and the density of simulated delays for q. Our results are
quantitatively very similar using the reverse formulation.
The KL divergence values are measured in bits. Higher values
indicate more information lost via the approximation, and thus
more dissimilarity between analytic and simulated distributions.
In our case, it quantifies the extent to which difference in the simu-
lation and analytic models lead to different distributions of delays.
The KL divergence of course depends on the parameters of
the models. We used recursive partitioning to create a decision
tree that split KL-divergence scores according to a least-squares
criterion, iteratively minimizing the remaining variance below
each node of the decision tree [33]. Thus, recursive partitioning
allowed us to identify and visualize the parameter combinations
that generated the largest discrepancies between analytic and
simulated delays.
3. Results
For our analytic model, we obtained explicit equations for the
mean and median delays for various levels of heterogeneity
as well as results for the sensitivity of the delays for all
levels of heterogeneity. Recall that the two parameters of
our derived density function for delays are the sparking
rate a, which is the rate at which infections are introduced
from outside of the population, and the sweep rate b, which
is the rate of change of R0. The parameter p indicates the
degree of heterogeneity in secondary cases. For the case
p ¼ 1, which corresponds to the heterogeneity caused by
the
assumption
of

when p ¼ 2. Recall that p ¼ 2 corresponds to a Poisson distri-
bution of secondary cases, whereas p ¼ 0.5 corresponds to a
highly overdispersed distribution of secondary cases. In the
electronic supplementary material, we show that for all p
the sensitivity of the mean and median to changes in either
the sparking rate or the sweep rate depends only on the quo-
tient of those two parameters. For relatively high sparking
rates, the mean and median have a similar level of sensitivity
to both parameters. As the sparking rate becomes relatively
lower, the sweep rate becomes less important because for a
broad range of rates the probability of an epidemic will be
close to one by the time the first spark occurs. The level of
heterogeneity in the distribution of secondary cases deter-
mines how quickly this transition happens by way of its
effect on the relationship between R0 and the probability of
an epidemic. Overall, the analytic results provide a rather
simple picture of the waiting times. However, in the
rsif.royalsocietypublishing.org
J. R. Soc. Interface 13: 20160540
4
 electronic supplementary material, we also show that the pic-
ture can be rather different if R0 changes according to a step
function instead of increasing linearly. For example, the
median delay has the lowest proportional sensitivity to the
sparking rate when the median delay just exceeds the time
of the jump in R0. In the following, we explore the extent to
which the picture changes due to the elements included in
our more complicated simulation models.
With data from stochastic simulations, we found mean
bifurcation delay to decrease with increasing values of
(i) sparking rate, (ii) population size, (iii) rate of increase in
transmission, and (iv) infectious period (figure 2). These
qualitative effects were not surprising, although the results
highlight the importance of particular combinations of
life-history traits. For instance, at a given value for the trans-
mission rate’s rate of change (a), different mean infectious
periods (1/g) can lead to very different predicted and
observed distributions of bifurcation delay (figure 2b–d)
because short infectious periods (i.e. high recovery rates)
lead to lower sweep rates for a given value of a. The sparking
rate and the sweep rate parameters of the analytic model are
thus also important parameters of the simulated delay times.
This parametrization also leads to a strong correlation of the
delays of the frequency- and density-dependent models,
although the delays of the frequency-dependent model are
typically a little smaller (electronic supplementary material,
figure S2). Note that the sweep rate is independent of popu-
lation
size
in
the
frequency-dependent
model,
so
the
relationship between life-history parameters and delay is
highly dependent on the type of transmission.
Closer examination of the sensitivity of the median simu-
lated delay to changes in the sweep rate revealed both
similarities and differences with our analytic model. This sen-
sitivity may be quantified as the slope of a least-squares line
in the plot of log(median delay) versus log(sweep rate). Such
a slope is an estimate of the elasticity of the median with
respect to the sweep rate. Consistent with the analytic results,
increasing the sparking rate a increases the slope of the nega-
tive relationship between median simulation delays and the
sweep rate (figure 3 and table 4). However, for large a the
elasticity for the simulated delays is much more negative
than 20.5, which is the minimum possible value for our
analytic model (electronic supplementary material). This dis-
crepancy is due to simulations tending to produce more delay
than expected, which is in large part a consequence of the
stringent conditions for an epidemic in our simulations.
In general, predictions based on theory derived assuming
large, fixed population sizes are representative of stochastic
simulations (figure 2; electronic supplementary material,
figure S3). Recursive partitioning shows that approximately
78% of the variation in KL divergence can be accounted for
by the sparking (a) and sweep (b) rates. Differences in

 predicted and observed delay distributions were greatest
with slow sweep rates, fast recovery rates, high sparking
rates and small population sizes (electronic supplementary
material, figure S3).
For a given combination of host and pathogen life-history
parameters, longer delays give rise to larger outbreaks,
because R0 continues to increase ever-higher above the critical
value of 1. Thus, a measles outbreak that occurs, by chance, 1
year after the population becomes supercritical will be larger,
on average, than a measles outbreak that occurs six months
after the population becomes supercritical (assuming the
same underlying parameters). The slope of this relationship
between delay and prevalence within a life-history parametri-
zation depends on how quickly R0 changes relative to the
sparking rate (i.e. b/a, figure 4). Note that the relationship
between delay and prevalence does not necessarily hold
across parameter combinations (i.e. when comparing different
diseases; figure 4). Systems with shorter delays can have
higher peak prevalence if they exhibit a longer infectious
period, for instance, and thus a faster change in R0 over
time (which itself contributes to differences in mean delay).
4. Discussion
Forecasting outbreaks of newly emerging and re-emerging
diseases is difficult. Adding to this difficulty is the fact
that major outbreaks of emerging diseases need not occur
immediately after they become a possibility. Rather, they
can exhibit bifurcation delay, the duration of which has
until now remained largely undescribed. We have shown
that even for models that include substantial demographic
stochasticity, this delay is well described by a simple survival
function with two parameters. One is the rate of transmission
from outside of the population, which we call the sparking
rate, and the other is the rate of change of R0, which we
call the sweep rate. Further, the sensitivity of the delay to
changes in these parameters depends only on their quotient.
We next explain the intuition that indicates the importance of
these parameters.
We found that the greater the sparking rate, the smaller
the waiting time for a major disease outbreak (figure 3).
This result follows Bartlett [34], who showed that very low
sparking rates could generate long time lags between recur-
rent outbreaks. In dynamic bifurcations more generally, the
addition of stochasticity or noise to slow passages through
bifurcation points reduces bifurcation delay [35,36] by hasten-
ing the departure from an unstable equilibrium. While our
results are in agreement, we also note that ‘noise’ in our
system is strictly required for the critical transition to disease
emergence. Without any infections from outside the popu-
lation, a supercritical host population will never experience
an outbreak or epidemic.
We also found that bifurcation delay depends on the
sweep rate. This result is comparable with the phenomenon
in Bartlett’s model [34] where the time to a recurrent outbreak
depends on both the rate of influx of susceptibles and R0. With
slow sweep rates, the addition of an infectious individual to a
population in the interval following the time when R0 ¼ 1 h as
a low probability of leading to a major outbreak [37]. Natu-
rally, the expected time to the major outbreak increases in
this case, and bifurcation delay in disease emergence is not
simply the interval of time preceding a sparking event.
Our theoretical
and simulation results
captured the
expected negative relationship between the duration of bifur-
cation delay and the sweep rate of a system [36,38]. However,
we also found that the slope and intercept describing the
relationship between the duration of bifurcation delay and the
sweep rate depended on the sparking rate. The duration of
bifurcation delay depends more on the sparking rate when
the sparking rate is low (i.e. outbreaks are spark-limited), and
more on the sweep rate when the sparking rate is high (i.e.
driver-limited) (figure 3, see also electronic supplementary
material). The degree of spark- or driver-limitation of a system
reflects the size of disease outbreaks (figure 4). It may also deter-
mine the ability of early-warning systems based on critical
slowing down to detect the tipping point at R0 ¼ 1 because a
driver-limited system would likely experience a series of
minor outbreaks before a major outbreak. The near-critical
dynamics oftheminoroutbreaks couldtriggeran early warning.
There are a number of practical consequences of bifurcation
delay in disease emergence. First, delayed emergence means
host populations can be supercritical for extended periods of
time without experiencing a major outbreak (e.g. figure 1).
Stuttering chains of transmission do not necessarily indicate,
then, that R0 , 1. Without accounting for bifurcation delay,
we might underestimate the likelihood of a major epidemic
when transmission appears limited. This phenomenon is exhib-
ited in many of our simulations, and is likely to occur in
generic emergence time series with small clusters of cases fol-
lowed by large, unexpected outbreaks. A major difficulty for
disease risk assessment lies in determining whether a system
with apparent subcritical transmission is truly subcritical, or
actually supercritical and experiencing a delayed bifurcation.
Additionally, bifurcation delay in disease re-emergence can
obscure the timing of the system becoming supercritical, and
thus the level of a given driver that targeted control measures
might try to achieve to ‘roll-back’ disease risk. For instance,
slow reductions in vaccine uptake that contribute to a major
outbreak of a vaccine-preventable disease are also subject to
bifurcation delay [12]. Owing to the delay, control measures

 that increase vaccination coverage to what it was immediately
before an outbreak may not reduce R0 below 1 because R0
may have exceeded 1 substantially earlier than the beginning
of the outbreak. Further, separation in the timing of disease
(re)emergence and changes in factors permitting emergence
can compromise detection of statistical association between
epidemic occurrence and underlying causes.
While the effects of sparking (a) and the probability of
an epidemic given a spark (which is governed by the
sweep rate, b) on the duration of bifurcation delay are rela-
tively intuitive, it is worth reiterating the importance of the
terms that go into each. For instance, the absolute number
of infectious imports for a given system may depend on
population size (as in pre-vaccine era measles [39]), which
would have to be accounted for in any estimate of the
sparking rate. On the other hand, unless the populations
being modelled are very small (e.g. a school or village),
frequency-dependent
transmission
is
probably
a
better
assumption for many diseases [25,26] and so the sweep rate
may be largely independent of population size. Neverthe-
less, the same rate of change in the transmission rate for
two different diseases could still be consistent with different
sweep rates and thus different expectations of delay, and
even different sizes of eventual disease outbreaks. For
example, differences in the infectious period of childhood dis-
eases such as measles and pertussis could mean that a
constant 1% reduction in vaccine uptake per year would
result in earlier, larger pertussis outbreaks, because a longer
infectious period (all else being equal) generally increases
R0 (figure 4).
5. Conclusion
Moving forward, efforts relying on the identification of
critical slowing down to forecast the emergence of infectious
diseases may incorporate our findings about bifurcation
delay [12]. The rate of critical slowing down and the sweep
rate of a system are closely related, and indicators of critical
slowing down may be informative of the sweep rate. With
this information and an estimate of the sparking rate from
observed case data, future early-warning systems may be
able to not only generate forecasts of when R0 exceeds 1,
but also produce distributions of likely waiting times to
major outbreaks or epidemics (e.g. figure 2b–d). This
approach could also be used in hindsight, in order to better
assess the timing of when R0 exceeded 1 to set the stage for
previous epidemics. Our goal is that this combined framework
will
produce
model-independent
forecasts that
provide
actionable information about the state of an emerging disease,
particularly during the transition from subcritical dynamics to
sustained transmission among hosts.

Figure 4. Bifurcation delay can lead to epidemics with greater peak preva-
lence, although this effect depends on the life-history parameters of the
system. Panels show peak epidemic prevalence by stochastic realizations of
bifurcation delay (x-axis on log-scale). Symbols and line types represent
three different infectious periods, approximating three important childhood
diseases (5 days for measles, 9 days for chickenpox, 22 days for pertussis).
Lines are loess smooths added for visual clarity. Colour represents the ratio
of b to a, which describes how quickly R0 changes relative to how frequently
imported infections occur in a system. Symbols are positioned at the median
of the x- and y-axes for each combination of life-history parameters.
Panels show four different initial population sizes (N0 ¼ 500, 1000, 5000
and 10 000). The relationship between delay and peak infection prevalence
depends on how quickly R0 increases, which is governed by the sweep
rate, mean infectious period and population size. (Online version in colour.)
