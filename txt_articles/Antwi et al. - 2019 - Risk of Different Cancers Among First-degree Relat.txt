Abstract
Background: Increased risk of malignancies other than pancreatic cancer (PC) has been reported among first-degree relatives
(FDRs) of PC patients; however, the roles of susceptibility gene mutations are unclear. We assessed risk for 15 cancers among
FDRs of unselected PC probands.
Methods: Data on 17 162 FDRs, with more than 336 000 person-years at risk, identified through 2305 sequential PC probands
enrolled at Mayo Clinic (2000–2016) were analyzed. Family history data were provided by the probands. Standardized inci-
dence ratios (SIRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated, comparing malignancies observed among the FDRs
with that expected using Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) data. Genetic testing was performed among a
subset of probands (n ¼ 2094), enabling stratified analyses among FDRs based on whether the related proband tested positive
or negative for inherited mutation in 22 sequenced cancer susceptibility genes. All statistical tests were two-sided.
Results: Compared with SEER, PC risk was twofold higher among FDRs of PC probands (SIR ¼ 2.04, 95% CI ¼ 1.78 to 2.31,
P < .001). Primary liver cancer risk was elevated among female FDRs (SIR ¼ 2.10, 95% CI ¼ 1.34 to 3.12, P < .001). PC risk
was more elevated among FDRs of mutation-positive probands (SIR ¼ 4.32, 95% CI ¼ 3.10 to 5.86) than FDRs of mutation-
negative probands (SIR ¼ 1.77, 95% CI ¼ 1.51 to 2.05, between-group P < .001). FDR PC risk was higher when the related
proband was younger than age 60 years at diagnosis and mutation-positive (SIR ¼ 5.24, 95% CI ¼ 2.93 to 8.64) than when
the proband was younger than age 60 years but mutation-negative (SIR ¼ 1.76, 95% CI ¼ 1.21 to 2.47, between-group P <
.001). Breast (SIR ¼ 1.29, 95% CI ¼ 1.01 to 1.63) and ovarian (SIR ¼ 2.38, 95% CI ¼ 1.30 to 4.00) cancers were elevated among
FDRs of mutation-positive probands.
Conclusions: Our study substantiates twofold risk of PC among FDRs of PC patients and suggests increased risk for primary
liver cancer among female FDRs. FDRs of susceptibility mutation carriers had substantially increased risk for PC and
increased risk for breast and ovarian cancers.

 Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a rapidly fatal malignancy with estab-
lished risk factors that include tobacco smoking, long-standing
diabetes, chronic pancreatitis, obesity, and positive family history
of PC (1–3). In general, family history of cancer is important for ac-
curate cancer risk stratification toward primary prevention, early
detection, and timely intervention. Studies have shown that cer-
tain cancers tend to cluster in families due in part to inherited
susceptibility and shared environmental exposures (4,5). Some
genetic syndromes have a pleiotropic effect and are characterized
by the presence of different cancer types among mutation car-
riers in the family, presumably because the underlying suscepti-
bility variants target multiple tissues (4–6). For example, inherited
mutations in CDKN2A (p16) can predispose to malignant mela-
noma or PC, and mutations in BRCA1, BRCA2, or PALB2 predispose
to breast cancer, ovarian cancer, or PC, whereas mutations in
TP53 can predispose to leukemia, breast cancer, brain cancer, or
soft tissue sarcoma (4,6–8). Reliable estimates for the risk of dif-
ferent cancers in families of PC patients who have been tested for
susceptibility genes are not available.
Individuals with PC often have multiple first-degree relatives
(FDRs) affected with cancers other than PC (7,9–11), but most
studies have focused primarily on the PC risk (reviewed in [12]).
In 2005, we examined the occurrence of 14 common malignan-
cies among 3335 FDRs of 426 incident PC cases diagnosed at
Mayo Clinic and compared the observed number of cases of
each cancer type with those expected based on data from the
Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program
(11). The study, which included more than 130 000 person-years
at risk, found higher than expected risks of PC and liver cancer
and lower than expected risks of bladder, lung, lymphoma,
prostate, and breast cancers among the FDRs, compared with
the SEER reference population. In 2009, Wang et al. examined
risk of death from extrapancreatic malignancies among 8564
FDRs of 1328 PC probands (13). Comparing deaths from 17 can-
cers among FDRs with more than 200 000 person-years of
follow-up with the expected number of deaths for each cancer
based on SEER data, they reported an increased risk of death
from breast, liver, ovarian, and bile duct cancers among the
FDRs (13). When stratified by familial vs sporadic kindreds,
deaths from breast, liver, ovarian, and bile duct cancers
remained increased in the familial kindreds, but only bile duct
cancer deaths were elevated in the sporadic kindreds (13).
Broader insight into the pattern and scope of aggregation of
cancers among relatives of PC probands can be gained with
large sample sizes and evaluation of the role of inherited muta-
tions. In the present study, we extend our previous work (11) us-
ing a larger sample size, including the data from our previous
work, and additionally examined the influence of germline mu-
tation status of PC probands on FDRs’ cancer risk. Specifically,
we examined the risk of 15 common malignancies among these
FDRs, investigating whether risk differed by FDRs’ kinship sta-
tus, the FDRs’ smoking history, or the probands’ age at diagno-
sis. In a subset of probands who were tested for germline
mutations in 22 cancer predisposition genes, we compared can-
cer risk among FDRs of mutation-positive probands with FDRs
of mutation-negative probands.
Methods
Study Population
The prospective Mayo Clinic Biospecimen Resource for Pancreas
Research is a registry of PC probands that utilizes an ultrarapid
case ascertainment process for patient recruitment, with a par-
ticipation rate of approximately 70% (14,15). The main reasons
for nonparticipation in the registry are the severely debilitating
nature of PC and its rapidly fatal course (14). Included in the pre-
sent study were data reported on 17 162 FDRs (parents, siblings,
and children) of 2305 unselected, consecutively enrolled PC pro-
bands in the registry between October 2000 and June 2016. For
validation analyses described below, we used self-reported per-
sonal history of cancer provided by FDRs, who themselves en-
rolled in a separate familial PC study (16). Informed consent was
obtained from each proband and each FDR in the familial PC
study. The study was approved by the Mayo Clinic Institutional
Review Board.
Data Collection
The PC probands completed structured risk factor question-
naires at enrollment that sought information on each FDR, in-
cluding cancer diagnosis, age at diagnosis, dates of diagnosis,
birth, and death (if applicable), and smoking history. We com-
pared reported cases of 15 common malignancies among the
FDRs with the expected number of cases for each cancer using
data from the SEER 9 registries (1973–2013) (17), aligning with
our previous study (11). The cancers of interest were primary
bladder, brain, breast, colorectal, gastric, head and neck, leuke-
mia, liver, lung, lymphoma, melanoma, multiple myeloma,
ovary, pancreas, and prostate carcinomas. Analyses of brain,
liver, and lung cancers were restricted to instances where each
was the only cancer reported in an FDR (hereafter referred as
primary liver, brain, or lung cancer). Because these 15 malignan-
cies rarely occur in persons younger than age 20 years, we re-
stricted the analyses to FDRs who were age 20 years or older.
Detailed pedigrees were constructed based on family history in-
formation provided by the probands.
Germline mutations in 22 cancer predisposition genes were
assessed by sequencing leukocyte DNA obtained from the PC
probands. Genetic testing was performed among probands who
provided blood samples (2094 of 2305 probands). Among the
genes tested, 144 unique mutations determined to be deleteri-
ous (excluding variants of uncertain significance) were detected
in 19 of the cancer predisposition genes: APC, ATM, BARD1,
BRCA1, BRCA2, BRIP1, CDKN2A, CHEK2, FANCC, MLH1, MSH2,
MSH6, NBN, PALB2, PMS2, PRSS1, RAD51C, RAD51D, and TP53.
None of the probands carried a mutation in CDH1, PTEN, or
EPCAM (18). The FDRs were classified as belonging to mutation-
positive or mutation-negative pedigrees based on whether the
related proband tested positive for a mutation in any of the
tested genes (n ¼ 1465; 198 pedigrees) or tested negative for all
22 genes (n ¼ 14 168; 1896 pedigrees). Risk analyses were per-
formed

among
full
siblings
of
probands
who
were
mutation-positive (n ¼ 636; 182 pedigrees) vs mutation-negative
(n ¼ 5663; 1728 pedigrees).
Statistical Analyses
Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) and 95% confidence inter-
vals (CIs) were used to estimate the risk of the 15 malignancies
among the FDRs. The SIRs were calculated for each cancer as
the ratio of the observed to the expected number of cases. The
expected number of cases was calculated from SEER data (17)
based on five-year age group–specific and sex-specific incidence
of each cancer multiplied by person-years at risk (17). SIRs were
calculated for the overall sample as well as for males and

 females separately. Three subanalyses were performed based
on 1) FDRs’ kinship status to the proband (mother, father, sib-
ling, and parents plus siblings), 2) FDRs’ personal smoking his-
tory (never vs ever), and 3) age of the proband at diagnosis of PC
(<60 vs �60 years). Additionally, SIRs were calculated among
FDRs of mutation-positive vs FDRs of mutation-negative pro-
bands and stratified by age of the proband at diagnosis (<60
years vs �60 years) in each group, and among full siblings of
mutation-positive vs mutation-negative probands. Stratified
analyses by sex were performed for each of these analyses.
Because of incomplete data on some of the FDRs, date of
birth was imputed for 4135 FDRs (24.1%) and date of death was
imputed
for
1748
(10.2%),
as
was
done
previously
(Supplementary Methods, available online) (11). While PC diag-
noses among all probands were pathologically (>95%) or clini-
cally confirmed, this level of verification among the FDRs was
not feasible in the present study. Therefore, we relied on pro-
bands’ report of cancer diagnosis in an FDR, which has been
shown to have an accuracy rate ranging between 60% and 80%
(19,20). In validation analyses, we assessed the accuracy of pro-
bands’ report of cancer diagnosis in an FDR by comparing the
proband report with the specified FDR’s report of personal his-
tory of cancer. We used a subset of data extracted from the fa-
milial PC study (16), wherein 480 FDRs (both affected and
unaffected) completed the same questionnaires administered
to the probands; their responses were used to validate the pro-
bands’
report.
All
statistical
tests
were
two-sided
and
performed with SAS v9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). P values for
statistical difference between SIRs were calculated assuming
binomial distribution, as described in detail (21). See the
Supplementary Methods (available online) for more details.
P values less than .05 or confidence intervals that do not include
1.00 were considered statistically significant (22,23).
Results
The analyses included 17 162 FDRs, with more than 336 000
person-years at risk, identified through 2305 incident PC pro-
bands (Supplementary Methods, available online). The FDRs
consisted of 4610 parents, 6920 siblings, and 5632 offspring.
There were roughly equal proportions of male (50.6%) and fe-
male (49.3%) FDRs, and 43.2% of the FDRs had ever smoked.
Overall, there were 3376 reported cases of cancer among the
FDRs. Carcinomas of the breast (n ¼ 463), colon and rectum
(n ¼ 338),
prostate
(n ¼ 338),
lung
(n ¼ 302),
and
pancreas
(n ¼ 233) were the most frequently reported malignancies.
The age- and sex-adjusted SIRs showed a twofold excess risk
of PC among the FDRs (SIR ¼ 2.04, 95% CI ¼ 1.78 to 2.31, P < .001)
as compared with the SEER reference population (Table 1).
Incidence ratios for bladder, breast, colorectal, gastric, head and
neck, leukemia, lung, lymphoma, melanoma, multiple mye-
loma, and prostate carcinomas were lower than expected
among the FDRs compared with the SEER population. PC risk
was elevated among both male and female FDRs. Among male
FDRs only, gastric, head and neck, leukemia, melanoma, and
prostate carcinomas were lower than expected; among female
FDRs, breast cancer was lower (SIR ¼ 0.77, 95% CI ¼ 0.70 to 0.84,
P < .001), but primary liver cancer was higher (SIR ¼ 2.10, 95% CI
¼ 1.34 to 3.12, P < .001) than expected. In subgroup analyses, we
observed an excess risk of PC among the FDRs regardless of
their relation to the proband, their smoking status, or the pro-
band’s age at diagnosis (Supplementary Table 1, available on-
line). The results from the subgroup analyses are similar to
those reported in Table 1, with a few notable findings. The mag-
nitude of PC risk for FDRs of young-onset PC probands (before
age 60 years) was somewhat higher (SIR ¼ 2.39, 95% CI ¼ 1.82 to
3.09) than that of FDRs of older-onset probands (SIR ¼ 1.94, 95%
CI ¼ 1.66 to 2.25) (Supplementary Table 1, available online).
FDRs who had ever smoked had higher PC risk (SIR ¼ 2.40, 95%
CI ¼ 1.98 to 2.89) than nonsmoking FDRs (SIR ¼ 1.64, 95% CI ¼
1.32 to 2.00). Primary liver cancer was higher among mothers of
the probands (SIR ¼ 3.38, 95% CI ¼ 1.89 to 5.58) and among FDRs
who had ever smoked (SIR ¼ 1.74, 95% CI ¼ 1.18 to 2.47).
A subset of probands was tested for inherited mutations in
22 cancer predisposition genes; 9.4% (198/2094) carried a muta-
tion in at least one of 19 genes (Supplementary Table 2, avail-
able online). Among FDRs of mutation-positive probands, we
observed 4.32 (95% CI ¼ 3.10 to 5.86) times as many cases of PC
as expected in the SEER reference population; the magnitude of
PC risk was lower among FDRs of mutation-negative probands
(SIR ¼ 1.77, 95% CI ¼ 1.51 to 2.05, between-group difference, P <
.001) (Table 2). Risks of breast (SIR ¼ 1.29, 95% CI ¼ 1.01 to 1.63)
and ovarian (SIR ¼ 2.38, 95% CI ¼ 1.30 to 4.00) cancers were
higher
among
FDRs
of
mutation-positive
probands;
while
among FDRs of mutation negative probands, breast cancer risk
was lower than expected (SIR ¼ 0.64, 95% CI ¼ 0.58 to 0.71), and
there was no association for ovarian cancer. These results are
very similar to those observed among full siblings of the pro-
bands (Table 3), such that PC risk was 4.09 (95% CI ¼ 2.42 to 6.46)
times higher than expected among siblings of mutation-
positive probands, while it was 1.52 (95% CI ¼ 1.16 to 1.94)
higher than expected among siblings of mutation-negative pro-
bands (between-group difference, P ¼ .001). Further, breast (SIR
¼ 1.63, 95% CI ¼ 1.17 to 2.22) and ovarian (SIR ¼ 2.52, 95% CI ¼
1.01 to 5.20) cancers were elevated among siblings of mutation-
positive probands. Among siblings of mutation-negative pro-
bands, breast cancer risk was lower than expected (SIR ¼ 0.65,
95% CI ¼ 0.55 to 0.76), and no association was found for ovarian
cancer. Similar results were obtained from the sex-stratified
analyses (Supplementary Tables 3 and 4, available online).
Moreover, FDRs of young-onset, mutation-positive probands
had much higher PC risk (SIR ¼ 5.24, 95% CI ¼ 2.93 to 8.64) than
FDRs of young-onset probands who were mutation-negative
(SIR ¼ 1.76, 95% CI ¼ 1.21 to 2.47, between-group difference, P <
.001) (Table 4). Similarly, FDRs of mutation-positive, older-onset
probands had higher PC risk (SIR ¼ 3.93, 95% CI ¼ 2.56 to 5.75)
than FDRs of mutation-negative, older-onset probands (SIR ¼
1.77, 95% CI ¼ 1.48 to 2.09, between-group difference, P ¼ .001)
(Table 5; Supplementary Table 6, available online).
To assess the accuracy of reporting by the probands, we
compared probands’ report of a history of cancer in an FDR with
the FDR’s self-report among those with available data (n ¼ 480).
For PC, 98.5% (473/480) of reports were concordant. For the other
cancers,
94%
(434/462)
of
reports
were
concordant
(Supplementary Methods, available online).
Discussion
We examined the risk of 15 common malignancies among FDRs
of PC probands by comparing numbers of each cancer type ob-
served among the FDRs with those expected using data from
SEER. We observed a twofold higher than expected risk of PC
among FDRs of the PC probands. Risk estimates for PC were con-
sistently increased among parents and siblings of the probands,
and suggest a potential aggregation of PC with primary liver
cancer among female FDRs. Further analyses showed that the

than among nonsmoking FDRs, and the magnitude of the SIR
for PC was higher among FDRs of young-onset probands than
among FDRs of older-onset probands. We also observed lower
than expected risk of bladder, breast, colorectal, gastric, head
and neck, leukemia, lung, lymphoma, melanoma, multiple my-
eloma, and prostate carcinomas among the FDRs compared
with the SEER reference population.
Familial aggregation of certain cancers may be due to shared
genetic susceptibility and/or shared etiologic risk factors, or
chance alone (24). For PC, inherited genetic factors account for
5% to 10% of cases, while tobacco smoking accounts for 20% to
25% of cases (2,25). A nested case–control study found that
shared tobacco smoking behavior is an independent risk for fa-
milial aggregation of PC (26). Our results are consistent with in-
dependent reports (9,12,26–30) and with our previous smaller
study (11), in which we observed a nearly twofold increase in PC
risk among FDRs of PC probands (SIR ¼ 1.88, 95% CI ¼ 1.51 to
4.46) (11). Ghadirian et al. reported a fivefold increased risk
among FDRs of PC probands compared with FDRs of noncancer
controls and a twofold higher PC risk among FDRs of young-
onset probands (10). Klein and colleagues reported a ninefold
excess risk of PC among FDRs of PC probands compared with
SEER; and consistent with our findings, they found higher PC
risk among FDRs who had ever smoked (SIR ¼ 19.2, 95% CI ¼ 7.7
to 39.5) than among nonsmoking FDRs (SIR ¼ 6.25, 95% CI ¼ 1.70
to 16.0) (31).
Compared with the FDRs of 1896 PC probands who did not
carry a mutation in any of the cancer genes tested, PC risk was
statistically significantly higher among FDRs of probands who
tested positive for a mutation; this would be expected based on
Mendelian law probability that 50% of the full siblings likely
carry the mutation(s) detected in their related mutation-
positive proband. Ovarian and breast cancers were elevated
among FDRs, particularly siblings, of PC probands who were
mutation-positive. Moreover, SIRs for PC were much higher
among FDRs of young-onset probands who carry a susceptibility
gene mutation than among FDRs of young-onset probands who
were mutation-negative, or FDRs of older-onset probands re-
gardless of proband’s mutation status.
Because the liver, brain, and lung are common metastatic
sites, we restricted reported cancer cases for each of these
sites to instances where they were reported as the only pri-
mary site (ie, liver only, lung only, or brain only). Thus, the in-
creased risk of liver cancer observed among female FDRs,
which concurs with our earlier findings (11), is potentially
less prone to confounding by metastatic cases. Wang et al.
(13) reported excess risk of death from liver cancer among
FDRs of PC probands (standardized mortality ratio [SMR] ¼
1.91, 95% CI ¼ 1.07 to 3.14), with a stronger trend toward in-
creased risk among female FDRs (SMR ¼ 2.38, 95% CI ¼ 0.94 to
4.98) than among male FDRs (SMR ¼ 1.65, 95% CI ¼ 0.74 to
53.18) (13). Ghadirian et al. (10) also observed a statistically
nonsignificant increased risk of liver cancer among FDRs of
PC probands (relative risk ¼ 1.89). While the sample sizes
were small in these reports, these findings together suggest
aggregation of PC with liver cancer that may be due to sug-
gest the existence of a yet-to-be-identified pleiotropic genetic
variant associated with both conditions, shared environmen-
tal risk factors among family members, or a combination of
these factors. Further research involving pathologically con-
firmed primary liver cancers is needed before firm conclu-
sions can be drawn about the familial aggregation of PC with
liver cancer.

 Strengths of the study include the use of an extensive risk
factor questionnaire that allowed for uniform collection of data
on multiple malignancies, the very large sample size, and the
availability of cancer susceptibility mutation status on pro-
bands. A major limitation of this study is the reliance on pro-
bands’ reports of cancer diagnosis in an FDR as pathologic or
clinical verification of cancer in the FDRs was not feasible in
this study. In our subanalysis of FDRs from whom we had col-
lected self-reported data, we found 98% agreement in the
reporting of family history of PC between the probands and the
FDRs and 94% agreement for reporting of other malignancies.
This suggests that the potential impact of misclassification of
cancer in the FDRs is likely minimal. However, there is the pos-
sibility that the PC probands may have had a greater awareness
of a family history of PC than family history of other cancers,
which may explain the observed lower than expected risk of
some cancers among the FDRs as compared with the SEER pop-
ulation. Thus, underreporting of cancers other than PC has po-
tential impact on the lower than expected risk observed for
some cancers. Our study is limited also in its generalizability by
race; 97% of the probands were White. We imputed missing
data on dates of birth and death for some FDRs to ensure that
the analysis reflects the population of FDRs in our registry to
the fullest extent possible. Imputations were done a priori while
blinded to the cancer status of the FDRs; thus, potential misclas-
sification would be nondifferential by cancer status and would
tend to attenuate effect estimates toward the null (19,32).
Our study substantiates a twofold risk of PC among FDRs of
PC patients. It further suggests aggregation of PC with liver can-
cer among female FDRs. We found fourfold increased risk of PC
and elevated risk of breast and ovarian cancer in FDRs of sus-
ceptibility gene mutation carriers, suggesting a potential role of
inherited mutations in familial cancer risk. Younger age at the
proband’s PC diagnosis was also associated with increased PC
risk in the FDRs. Our findings enable more refined cancer risk
estimation for genetic counseling and inform cancer screening
recommendations for FDRs of PC probands.
