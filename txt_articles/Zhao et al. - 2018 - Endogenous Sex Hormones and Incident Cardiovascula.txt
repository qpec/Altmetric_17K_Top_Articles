ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND Higher androgen and lower estrogen levels are associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk fac-
tors in women. However, studies on sex hormones and incident CVD events in women have yielded conflicting results.
OBJECTIVES The authors assessed the associations of sex hormone levels with incident CVD, coronary heart disease
(CHD), and heart failure (HF) events among women without CVD at baseline.
METHODS The authors studied 2,834 post-menopausal women participating in the MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of
Atherosclerosis) with testosterone, estradiol, dehydroepiandrosterone, and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) levels
measured at baseline (2000 to 2002). They used Cox hazard models to evaluate associations of sex hormones with each
outcome, adjusting for demographics, CVD risk factors, and hormone therapy use.
RESULTS The mean age was 64.9 � 8.9 years. During 12.1 years of follow-up, 283 CVD, 171 CHD, and 103 HF incident
events occurred. In multivariable-adjusted models, the hazard ratio (95% confidence interval [CI]) associated with 1 SD
greater log-transformed sex hormone level for the respective outcomes of CVD, CHD, and HF were as follows:
total testosterone: 1.14 (95% CI: 1.01 to 1.29), 1.20 (95% CI: 1.03 to 1.40), 1.09 (95% CI: 0.90 to 1.34); estradiol:
0.94 (95% CI: 0.80 to 1.11), 0.77 (95% CI: 0.63 to 0.95), 0.78 (95% CI: 0.60 to 1.02); and testosterone/estradiol ratio:
1.19 (95% CI: 1.02 to 1.40), 1.45 (95% CI: 1.19 to 1.78), 1.31 (95% CI: 1.01 to 1.70). Dehydroepiandrosterone and SHBG
levels were not associated with these outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS Among post-menopausal women, a higher testosterone/estradiol ratio was associated with an elevated risk
for incident CVD, CHD, and HF events, higher levels of testosterone associated with increased CVD and CHD, whereas higher
estradiol levels were associated with a lower CHD risk. Sex hormone levels after menopause are associated with women’s
increased CVD risk later in life. (J Am Coll Cardiol 2018;71:2555–66) © 2018 by the American College of Cardiology Foundation.

therosclerotic cardiovascular disease
(CVD), which includes coronary heart
disease (CHD) and ischemic stroke,
affects
men
and
women
differently.
In
women, the risk of CVD is much lower than
in men until 50 years of age, but it rises
dramatically after menopause (1). It has been
hypothesized that lower levels of endogenous
estrogens and higher endogenous androgens
that occur as a consequence of the meno-
pausal transition might mediate the increased
CVD risk later in life in post-menopausal
women (1,2). This theory has been supported
by observational studies that demonstrate as-
sociations
between
higher
androgen
and
lower estrogen levels with CVD risk factors
in
post-menopausal
women,
including
elevated blood pressure, C-reactive protein
(CRP), and insulin resistance (1,3–5).
Studies examining the associations be-
tween sex hormone levels and CVD events in
post-menopausal
women,
however,
have
yielded conflicting results. Both high (6,7) and
low (8,9) androgen levels have been associ-
ated with increased risk of CVD. With respect
to estrogens, observational studies have demonstrated
that estradiol levels in women were either not associ-
ated (7,10) or inversely associated with CVD events (6).
As a result, the relationship of sex hormones with CVD
events in post-menopausal women is still unclear.
Studies of the association between sex hormone
levels and clinical CVD events in post-menopausal
women, however, have been limited by suboptimal
measurement of CVD events (10), use of hospital-
based study populations (9,11), small sample size
(11), or short duration of follow-up (7). Therefore, we
used data from the MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of
Atherosclerosis) to evaluate the association of sex
hormone levels with incident CVD, CHD, and heart
failure
(HF)
events
over
12-year
follow-up
in
a
community-based
population
of
post-menopausal
women free of CVD at baseline.
METHODS
STUDY PARTICIPANTS. MESA is a prospective cohort
study of 6,814 men and women of 4 race/ethnicities
(white, black, Hispanic, and Chinese) who were 45 to 84
years of age and free of CVD at the baseline visit (2000
to 2002) (12). Participants were recruited from 6 centers
across the United States (Los Angeles, California; St.
Paul, Minnesota; New York City, New York; Chicago,
Illinois; Forsyth County, North Carolina; Baltimore,
Maryland). The present analysis included all post-
menopausal women who attended the baseline exam
(n ¼ 3,087). We then excluded 160 participants missing
sex hormone measurements, 2 participants without
information on CVD outcomes, and 91 participants
missing other covariates. The final sample size was
2,834 post-menopausal women (Figure 1). The study
was approved by the institutional review boards of all
participating institutions, and written informed con-
sent was obtained from all participants.
MEASUREMENT OF SEX HORMONES. Sex hormone
concentrations were measured from fasting serum
samples that were drawn at the baseline examination
between 7:30 AM and 10:30 AM and stored at �70�C until
analysis. Biochemical analyses were performed at the
University
of
Massachusetts
Medical
Center
Sex Hormone Laboratory (Worcester, Massachusetts).
Total
testosterone
and
dehydroepiandrosterone
(DHEA) were measured using radioimmunoassay kits.
Sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) was measured
using a chemiluminescent enzyme immunometric
assay (Immulite kits, Diagnostic Products Corporation,
Los Angeles, California). Estradiol was measured using
an ultrasensitive radioimmunoassay kit (Diagnostic
System Laboratories, Webster, Texas). Concentrations
of bioavailable testosterone (the sum of SHBG-bound
and albumin-bound testosterone) and free testos-
terone (reported as a percentage of total testosterone)
were calculated according to the method of Södergård
(13). We divided total testosterone by estradiol to
calculate total testosterone/estradiol ratio for each
participant. Quality control serum was obtained from
an w10% blind pool. The coefficients of variation for
total testosterone, SHBG, DHEA, and estradiol were
12.3%, 9.0%, 11.2%, and 10.5%, respectively (4).

AND
HF
ASSESSMENT. Every
9
to
12
months,
participants
completed
a
telephone
interview about interim hospital admissions, cardio-
vascular outpatient diagnoses and procedures, and
deaths (12). Hospital records were obtained for 98% of
reported hospitalized CVD events, and some medical
record-based information was obtained for 95% of

Two
physicians
indepen-
dently
reviewed
and
adjudicated
events,
and
assigned
incidence
dates.
Outcome
events
were
identified through December 31, 2013.
Incident CHD was defined as definite or probable
myocardial infarction, resuscitated cardiac arrest,
definite or probable angina (if followed by revascu-
larization), and definite CHD death. Hard CHD events
excluded definite or probable angina. Incident CVD
events included incident CHD plus stroke, stroke
death, other atherosclerotic death, and other CVD
deaths. Hard CVD events included hard CHD, stroke,
and stroke death. Ischemic stroke was determined by
brain imaging with computed tomography or magnetic
resonance imaging and included large vessel athero-
sclerosis, cardioembolism, small-vessel occlusion, and
acute ischemic stroke of other unknown cause.
Incident HF was defined as definite or probable HF
and required symptoms such as shortness of breath or
edema. In addition to symptoms, probable HF required
a HF diagnosis by a physician and medical treatment
for HF. Definite HF required 1 or more criteria, such as
pulmonary edema or congestion by chest x-ray, ven-
tricular dilation or poor left ventricular (LV) function
by echocardiography or ventriculography, or evidence
of LV diastolic dysfunction. HF was classified as either
HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) (LV
ejection fraction [EF] $45%) or with reduced EF
(HFrEF) (LVEF <45%) (14).
MEASUREMENT OF OTHER COVARIATES. Demographic
characteristics, lifestyle factors, and medication use
including
hormone
therapy
(HT)
were
collected
through
standardized
questionnaires.
Menopausal
status was self-reported and corrected using infor-
mation on age, self-reported hysterectomy, bilateral
oophorectomy,
and
menopausal
age.
Only
post-
menopausal women were included in this analysis.
Level of education was classified as <high school,
high school/technical school/associate degree, and
college/graduate/professional school. Physical activ-
ity was estimated as the total amount of intentional
moderate or vigorous exercise performed in a usual
week, and measured in metabolic equivalent task–-
minutes. Smoking status was categorized into never,
former, or current smoker.
Height, weight, waist circumference, hip circum-
ference,
and
blood
pressure
were
measured
by
trained staff. Body mass index was calculated as
weight in kilograms divided by height in meters
squared. Waist-hip ratio (WHR) was calculated as
waist
circumference/hip
circumference.
Seated
resting blood pressure was measured 3 times using an
automated oscillometric sphygmomanometer (Dina-
map Pro100, GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, Wisconsin),
and the average of the second and third measure-
ments was used.
Blood samples were obtained from participants
at the baseline examination after a 12-h fast. Details of
measurements of clinical chemistry parameters are
provided elsewhere (15). Diabetes was defined as a
fasting serum glucose $126 mg/dl, a self-reported
history of a physician diagnosis of diabetes, or use
of
insulin
or
diabetes
medications.
Estimated
glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated on
the basis of serum creatinine and cystatin C concen-
trations using the CKD-EPI equation (16). Inflamma-
tory
markers including CRP, interleukin-6 (IL-6),
fibrinogen, and D-dimer were measured from stored
samples, as previously described (17).
STATISTICAL
ANALYSIS. Normally
distributed
continuous variables were expressed as mean � SD
and compared by CVD status using the Student’s t-
test or analysis of variance. Variables with skewed
distributions were expressed as median (interquartile
range [IQR]) and compared using the nonparametric
Wilcoxon rank sum test. Categorical variables were
expressed as percentage (%) and compared using the
chi-square test.
The associations between CVD risk factors and sex
hormone levels were evaluated using multivariable-
adjusted linear regression with loge-transformed sex
hormone levels as dependent variables. The study
endpoints were the development of incident CVD,
CHD, or HF. Participants were followed from the

endpoint, death, drop-out, or until December 31,
2013. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to
estimate multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (HR)
and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each study
endpoint associated with 1 SD greater loge-trans-
formed sex hormone levels. We also evaluated the
presence of nonlinear dose-response relationships
using restricted cubic splines with knots at the 5th,
35th, 65th, and 95th percentiles of their sample
distributions.
We used 3 models with increasing degrees of
adjustment. Model 1 adjusted for demographic fac-
tors: age, race/ethnicity, study site, and HT use.

 SHBG in the fully adjusted model to mutually ac-
count for one another.
We performed stratified analyses in pre-specified
subgroups defined by age and race/ethnicity. We also
performed sensitivity analyses excluding women who
were using HT at baseline (because estradiol levels
differ substantially among women taking vs. not
taking HT), and using hard CVD and hard CHD events
as endpoints instead of all CVD and CHD events.
Additionally, we conducted analysis using non-CVD
death as a competing risk. All reported p values were
2-sided, and the significance level was set at 0.05.
Statistical analyses were performed using STATA
version 14 (StataCorp LP, College Station, Texas).
RESULTS
The baseline characteristics of the study population
are presented in Table 1. The average age at baseline
was 64.9 � 8.9 years (IQR: 58 to 72 years). The median
(IQR) of sex hormone levels in nmol/l were: total
testosterone 0.90 (IQR: 0.59 to 1.32), estradiol 0.07
(IQR: 0.05 to 0.16), DHEA 10.20 (IQR: 6.97 to 14.50),
and SHBG 59.50 (IQR: 40.60 to 94.60), and for
testosterone/estradiol ratio was 11.82 (IQR: 4.88 to
22.21).
The
demographic-adjusted
associations
of
CVD risk factors (independent variables) with sex
hormone levels (dependent variables) at the baseline
examination are presented in Online Table 1.
Current smoking was associated with higher total
testosterone, testosterone/estradiol ratio, and DHEA
levels, and lower estradiol levels. Obesity and CRP
were associated with higher total testosterone and
estradiol, and with lower testosterone/estradiol ratio
and SHBG levels.
During 30,487 person-years of follow-up (median
[IQR] follow-up of 12.1 [IQR: 11.5 to 12.7] years), the
numbers of women who developed incident CVD,
CHD, and HF events were 283, 171, and 103, respec-
tively (incidence rates of 9.3, 5.5, and 3.3 per 1,000
person-years, respectively). At baseline, women who
developed incident CVD were more likely to be older,
diabetic,
hypertensive,
have
higher
WHR,
CRP,
D-dimer, fibrinogen, IL-6, bioavailable testosterone
levels, and testosterone/estradiol ratio, and have
lower education, DHEA and high-density lipoprotein
cholesterol
levels,
eGFR,
and
physical
activity
(Table 1).
A
higher
total
testosterone/estradiol
ratio
was
independently associated with an increased risk of
incident CVD, CHD, and HF (Table 2). The fully
adjusted HRs for CVD, CHD, and HF associated with
1 SD greater log-transformed testosterone/estradiol
ratio was 1.19 (95% CI: 1.02 to 1.40), 1.45 (95% CI: 1.19
to 1.78), and 1.31 (95% CI: 1.01 to 1.70), respectively
(model
3).
Total
testosterone
levels
were
also
associated with an increased risk of incident CVD
and CHD, but were not statistically significantly
associated with HF. The corresponding HRs associ-
ated with 1 SD increase in log-transformed total
testosterone were 1.14 (95% CI: 1.01 to 1.29), 1.20
(95% CI: 1.03 to 1.40), and 1.09 (95% CI: 0.90 to 1.34),
respectively. Bioavailable testosterone was associ-
ated with CVD and CHD in demographic-adjusted
models, but the associations were attenuated to
null in fully-adjusted models. The corresponding
HRs per 1 SD greater testosterone/estradiol ratio for
the other endpoints were directionally consistent
with the primary analyses as follows: hard CVD 1.29
(95% CI: 1.07 to 1.56), hard CHD 1.57 (95% CI: 1.22 to
2.02), and ischemic stroke 1.10 (95% CI: 0.81 to 1.48)
(Online Table 2) (model 3).
Estradiol levels were not associated with overall
CVD events, but were associated with a lower risk for
CHD, with a non-significant trend for lower HF risk.
The fully adjusted HRs for CVD, CHD, and HF asso-
ciated with 1 SD greater log-transformed estradiol
were 0.94 (95% CI: 0.80 to 1.11), 0.77 (95% CI: 0.63 to
0.95) and 0.78 (95% CI: 0.60 to 1.02), respectively
(Table 2) (model 3). The corresponding HRs per 1 SD
greater estradiol for other endpoints were as follows:
hard CVD 0.88 (95% CI: 0.72 to 1.06), hard CHD 0.69
(95% CI: 0.53 to 0.88), and ischemic stroke 1.11 (95%
CI: 0.80 to 1.55) (Online Table 2) (model 3).
DHEA and SHBG levels were not associated with
CVD, CHD, all HF, hard CVD, hard CHD, or ischemic
stroke in primary analyses.
Regarding the HF subtypes, testosterone/estradiol
ratio was positively associated, and both estradiol

The curves represent the adjusted HR of CVD/CHD/HF by log sex hormone levels. The dose response association was estimated by using a linear and a cubic spline term
for each sex hormone in the multivariable cox regression. Curves represent adjusted HR (solid line) and 95% confidence interval (dashed lines) based on restricted
cubic splines for sex hormones with knots at the 5th, 35th, 65th, and 95th percentiles of their sample distributions. The reference values (diamonds) were set at the
10th percentile. The model was adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, study center, education, waist-to-hip ratio, physical activity, smoking, systolic blood pressure, use of
antihypertensive medications, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, use of lipid-lowering medications, diabetes, estimated glomerular filtration rate,
use of hormone therapy, log(C-reactive protein), log(interleukin-6), log(fibrinogen), and log(D-dimer). (A) Total testosterone (T) (nmol/l); (B) estradiol (nmol/l); and

 positively associated with CHD and HF, whereas
estradiol was inversely associated with CHD, similar
to the primary analyses. However, in this sensitivity
analysis, free testosterone was now inversely associ-
ated with CHD (0.71 [95% CI: 0.54 to 0.93]) and SHBG
levels were positively associated with CHD (1.39
[95% CI: 1.07 to 1.82]). When all sex hormones were
included
in
the
same
model,
the
associations
remained similar (Online Table 3 for all women and
Online Table 4 for women not on HT). Additional
competing risk analyses yielded similar results to
primary analysis (Online Table 5).
In spline regression analyses, the risk of incident
CVD and CHD increased progressively with total
testosterone levels and testosterone/estradiol ratio
(Figures 2A and 2C), and the risk of incident CHD and
HF
decreased
progressively
with
estradiol
levels
(Figure 2B), adjusted for variables in model 3. The
p values for the nonlinear spline components of total
testosterone for CVD, CHD, and HF were 0.17, 0.08,
and 0.22, respectively; for testosterone/estradiol ratio
were 0.40, 0.13, and 0.006, respectively; and for
estradiol were 0.58, 0.49, and 0.06, respectively,
indicating that the associations of sex hormones with
these endpoints were approximately linear, except
for testosterone/estradiol ratio and risk of HF, which
was U-shaped.
The associations between sex hormones and CVD
outcomes were generally consistent across all age and
race/ethnic subgroups, except that in younger par-
ticipants (<65 years of age), the association of DHEA
levels with CVD, CHD, and HF endpoints was inverse
whereas it was null in older participants ($65 years)
(Figure 3).

 DISCUSSION
Among racially/ethnically diverse post-menopausal
women
followed
for
>12
years,
we
found
that
higher testosterone/estradiol ratio was associated
with an elevated risk for incident CVD, CHD, and
HF events, higher total testosterone was associated
with increased risk of CVD and CHD, and higher
estradiol levels were associated with a lower risk of
CHD (Central Illustration). The associations persisted
after adjustment for traditional cardiovascular risk
factors, suggesting an independent role of sex hor-
mones on cardiovascular events. The risks for CVD
and
CHD
were
approximately
linear
across
the
whole
range
of
total
testosterone,
testosterone/
estradiol ratio, and estradiol levels. However, there
was a U-shaped association between testosterone/
estradiol ratio and HF, with both extreme ends at
higher
risk
for
HF. Additionally,
we
found that
testosterone/estradiol
ratio
was
positively,
and
estradiol and DHEA were inversely, associated with
risk of HFrEF.
Several biological mechanisms may underlie the
association between endogenous sex hormones and
CVD and its risk factors in women. Estrogens can
promote
vasodilation
through
increasing
plasma
concentrations of endothelium-derived relaxing fac-
tor nitric oxide, and can inhibit the renin angiotensin
system by reducing transcription of angiotensin-
converting enzyme (18). In addition to its favorable
effects on lipids, estrogens can also reduce blood
pressure through increasing endothelial vasodilator

 function and modulating autonomic function. Addi-
tionally, estrogen is thought to regulate specific in-
flammatory markers and cytokines (19). By contrast,
testosterone
can
induce
vasoconstriction
and
increased platelet aggregation through up-regulation
of thromboxane (20). In population studies, andro-
gens are associated with increased accumulation of
visceral fat, lipid levels, and increased levels of car-
diometabolic risk factors (2,3,21), including blood
pressure, body mass index, CRP, and insulin resis-
tance in women (1,3–5). Furthermore, a history of
early age of menopausal onset and shorter duration
from menarche to menopause are associated with
higher risk of cardiovascular outcomes, including
CVD mortality, CHD, and HF (22,23); this again sug-
gests a role of sex hormones in disease pathogenesis.
Despite plausible pathological pathways linking
endogenous sex hormones and clinical CVD events,
prospective studies have been contradictory. In a
population-based study in Denmark (N ¼ 4,600 pre-
menopausal and post-menopausal women), higher
baseline total testosterone levels were associated
with an increased risk of CHD and death over 30 years
follow-up (6). In the WHS (Women’s Health Study),
200 post-menopausal women who developed CVD >3
years
of
follow-up
had
a
higher
baseline
free
androgen index compared with controls, but the as-
sociation was null after adjustment for CVD risk fac-
tors (7), and a population-based cohort study in
Germany (N ¼ 2,129 middle-aged women, 11-year
follow-up) also concluded that baseline total testos-
terone was not associated with incident CVD or
mortality (24). Furthermore, the Rancho Bernardo
Study (8,10) (N ¼ 639 post-menopausal women, 12-
year follow-up) and a hospital-based cohort study in
Germany (9) (N ¼ 2,914 women between 18 and 75
years of age, 4.5-year follow-up) both found that
lower
baseline
levels
of
total
testosterone
were
associated with increased CVD events, which con-
trasts with our findings.
With
respect
to
estrogens,
a
population-based
study in Denmark found that lower estradiol levels
were associated with increased risk of CHD and death
(6), but the WHS trial (7), Rancho Bernardo Study
(8,10), and a nested case-control study of elderly
diabetic women (11) found no association between
estradiol levels and CVD events.
Several methodological differences could explain
the discrepancies in the associations observed in
previous studies. First, previous studies have used
different study designs, with a mixture of cohort
(8,9,24), nested cohort (6), nested case-control de-
signs (7), with follow-up times ranging from 4 to
almost 30 years. Second, the study populations were
very diverse, with mean age ranging from 49 to 74
years. Finally, these studies used different measure-
ments of CVD events, including self-reports (8,10,24),
national patient registries (6), and medical records
(7,9).
Our study supports an association of higher total
testosterone levels and higher testosterone/estradiol
ratio with increased CVD and CHD events in post-
menopausal women, as well as an association of
higher estradiol levels with reduced CHD and HF
events, although the association between estradiol
and HF did not reach statistical significance (HF
events were fewer than CHD events, with therefore
less power to detect associations). Among HF sub-
types, we found that higher testosterone/estradiol
ratio and lower estradiol levels were associated with
increased risk for HFrEF, but not HFpEF, the type of
HF more commonly seen in older women. It is
possible
that
the
reduction
in
estradiol
during
menopause differentially affects vascular and cardiac
remodeling processes that differentially lead to a
HFrEF versus HFpEF phenotype. Lower levels of
estradiol are associated with risk for hypertension
(25), a risk factor for HFrEF. In our study, estradiol
was associated with CHD, and CHD may contribute
more to HFrEF than to HFpEF. As mentioned, our
results
contradicted
the
2
Germany
studies
and
Rancho Bernardo Study that showed null or reversed
association
between
total
testosterone
and
CVD
events (8,9,24). The difference may be due to the
selection of study participants (younger women with
mean age 49 years, and hospital-based in the German
study) or ascertainment of CVD outcome (self-report
in
Rancho
Bernardo
Study).
Further
studies
are
needed to confirm these findings and to better un-
derstand the associations and mechanisms between
sex hormones and subtypes of HF.
In our study, SHBG and DHEA levels were not
associated with CVD, CHD, or overall HF. However,
SHBG was associated with increased risk for CHD in
women not taking HT. This result aligns with a previ-
ous MESA study analysis showing that SHBG was
positively associated with coronary artery calcification
(15). Nevertheless, other studies have not found an
association
between
SHBG
and
incident
CVD
(7,10,11,24). Additionally, in our study, DHEA was
inversely associated with HFrEF risk, an association
that needs to be confirmed in other studies. The role of
DHEA on CVD is still undefined. It was hypothesized
that lower DHEA levels might be related to increased
risk of CVD (26), but this association was refuted by
many studies, especially among women (27,28).
Although sex hormone levels may be linked to
future
CVD
events,
it
is
unclear
what
the

 intervention is to modify sex hormone levels for risk
reduction. Although randomized clinical trials failed
to conclusively show a beneficial effect of HT on CHD
risk or CVD mortality in post-menopausal women in
primary prevention (29,30), the trials generally did
not
consider
compounds
other
than
conjugated
equine estrogen and medroxyprogesterone acetate,
and the conclusions may not be generalized to all
menopausal women in different ages (29,31,32). HT
may not exert the same physiological effects as
endogenous sex hormones, and effects vary depend-
ing on the different formulations of estrogen and
progestin (33). Also, the time of HT initiation may
determine HT effects on CVD risk. It has been sug-
gested that estrogen therapy may prevent subclinical
atherosclerosis
in
perimenopausal
women
when
given around the time of the menopausal transition,
but has no benefit on CVD risk in later life after
menopause (29,34,35).
STUDY STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS. Our study
has many strengths, such as the inclusion of a large,
diverse,
well-characterized
multiethnic
group
of
women prospectively followed for more than 10
years. We investigated the associations of sex hor-
mones with a variety of CVD outcomes after careful
adjustment for a number of potential confounders
and use of HT.
However, our results should be considered in
the context of some limitations. First, despite the
sample size and the long duration of follow-up, the
number of events observed in our study was limited
for some outcomes, particularly for HF subtypes and
ischemic stroke, limiting our power to detect associ-
ations. Additionally, although large variation of as-
sociations
across
race/ethnicity
were
seen,
the
sample size may limit the detection of significant
interaction between sex hormone levels and race/
ethnicity. Second, we studied multiple sex hormones
and outcomes, and some associations may have been
observed by chance. However, we based our conclu-
sions not only on significance tests, but also on bio-
logical plausibility, dose-response, and consistency of
the associations. Third, although we adjusted for
multiple potential confounders, we cannot exclude
the
possibility
of
residual
confounding.
Fourth,
menopausal status was self-reported and subject to
reporting bias, although we corrected self-reported
menopausal status using an algorithm based on age,
self-reported hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy,
and menopausal age. Finally, sex hormone levels
were only assessed once at baseline and were not
repeatedly measured during follow-up. In particular,
we did not have information on sex hormone levels
before and during the menopausal transition. As a
consequence, we could not examine the association
of changes in sex hormone levels with CVD events.
CONCLUSIONS
Our study suggests that, in post-menopausal women,
higher testosterone/estradiol ratio is associated with
the
development of
CVD, CHD,
and HF events,
whereas estradiol is associated with a reduced risk of
CHD and HFrEF. Sex hormone levels, especially
higher
total
testosterone
versus
estrogen
after
menopause, may contribute to women’s increased
CVD risk later in life. However, in the absence of
supportive interventional studies, the best strategy
to modify sex hormone levels to affect CVD risk is
still uncertain. Nonetheless, a more androgenic sex
hormone profile may identify a woman at higher risk
for CVD who may benefit from other risk-reducing
strategies.

PERSPECTIVES
COMPETENCY IN MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE: In post-
menopausal women, a higher total testosterone/estradiol ratio
was associated with increased risk for incident CVD, CHD, and HF.
Total testosterone levels were associated with cardiovascular
and coronary events, while estradiol was associated with a
reduced risk of coronary events and HF.
TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: Further studies are needed to
identify individual patient risk factors that interact with sex
hormones in menopausal women to guide development and
implementation of preventive strategies.
