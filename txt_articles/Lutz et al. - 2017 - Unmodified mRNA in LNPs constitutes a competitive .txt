mRNA represents a promising new vaccine technology platform with high flexibility in regard to development and production.
Here, we demonstrate that vaccines based on sequence optimized, chemically unmodified mRNA formulated in optimized lipid
nanoparticles (LNPs) are highly immunogenic and well tolerated in non-human primates (NHPs). Single intramuscular vaccination of
NHPs with LNP-formulated mRNAs encoding rabies or influenza antigens induced protective antibody titers, which could be
boosted and remained stable during an observation period of up to 1 year. First mechanistic insights into the mode of action of the
LNP-formulated mRNA vaccines demonstrated a strong activation of the innate immune response at the injection site and in the
draining lymph nodes (dLNs). Activation of the innate immune system was reflected by a transient induction of pro-inflammatory
cytokines and chemokines and activation of the majority of immune cells in the dLNs. Notably, our data demonstrate that mRNA
vaccines can compete with licensed vaccines based on inactivated virus or are even superior in respect of functional antibody and T
cell responses. Importantly, we show that the developed LNP-formulated mRNA vaccines can be used as a vaccination platform
allowing multiple, sequential vaccinations against different pathogens. These results provide strong evidence that the mRNA
technology is a valid approach for the development of effective prophylactic vaccines to prevent infectious diseases.

INTRODUCTION
The introduction of prophylactic vaccination has been one of the
most effective medical interventions to fight and eradicate
infectious diseases. Despite its great successes, the continuous
threat of infectious agents for which no vaccine exists and the
introduction of new pathogens into the human population
emphasize the need for the development of novel safe vaccines
and even vaccine platforms capable of rapidly responding to
those needs. Ideally, these vaccine platforms should be highly
versatile at minimal development and production costs.
Vaccines based on mRNA could meet these requirements
because they offer multifaceted advantages including flexible
antigen design, a cost-effective manufacturing process allowing
for parallel production of multiple mRNA vaccines1–5 and rapid
manufacturing, which could be of crucial importance during
pandemics.6
Using exclusively unmodified nucleosides, we have demon-
strated that non-replicating mRNA vaccines are immunogenic and
capable of inducing protection against lethal rabies and influenza
virus infections after intradermal vaccination (i.d.) in mice, rats,
ferrets, and pigs.7,8 These vaccines contained free and protamine-
complexed mRNA to support both strong antigen expression and
immunostimulation.9 This approach was specifically optimized for
i.d. administration and showed lower efficacy when given by the
intramuscular route (i.m.) as preferred route for prophylactic
vaccination, highlighting the important role of formulation in
vaccine design. Studies with self-amplifying mRNA vaccines
investigated the effect of different formulations such as lipid-
nanoparticles (LNP)10 or cationic nanoemulsion (CNE)11 on the
immunogenicity of mRNA vaccines. Self-amplifying vaccines
benefited from formulation with LNP or CNE and were able to
induce protective antibody titers. In contrast, non-replicating
mRNA did not induce any detectable antibody titers even when
formulated with CNE. These data reveal a gap between self-
amplifying and non-replicating mRNA, which cannot be closed
only by formulation. This demonstrates a clear need to optimize
the mRNA itself to obtain sufficient expression levels. To this end,
different approaches of optimization are pursued.
In recent publications chemically modified nucleosides were
used to reach sufficient antigen expression,12–15 which is in
contrast to our proprietary mRNA technology, which employs
sequence optimization and selected untranslated regions (UTRs)
to achieve high antigen expression.16 In these studies, mice were
vaccinated i.m. with LNP-formulated mRNA vaccines inducing
protection against Zika virus challenge infections,12 and protec-
tion against placental damage and fetal demise in challenged
pregnant mice.13 Importantly, protective efficacy against Zika virus
challenge infections was also demonstrated in non-human
primates (NHPs) after i.d. vaccination.14 Immunogenicity data in
NHPs are absolutely desirable taking into account the experiences
with early DNA vaccines, for which efficacy could not be translated
from mice to NHPs. The study by Pardi et al. demonstrates that
non-replicating mRNA is able to induce antibody titers in NHPs. To
this end, they applied ten separate i.d. injections distributed on
the back of the animals. For prophylactic vaccination single
injections are highly desirable with i.m. application being the
routinely used route. Notably, previous studies have demonstrated

vaccination, which could be due to the lower frequency of
antigen-presenting cells in the muscle compared to the skin.
Meanwhile, induction of protective immune responses against
two different influenza strains could be demonstrated also after i.
m. administration in NHPs and humans, again using LNP-
formulated mRNA vaccines based on chemically modified nucleo-
sides.15 In summary, while those results definitely established
mRNA as an appropriate tool for vaccination in research, further
questions have to be addressed to finally prove it to be a
competitive platform for vaccine development.
In the present study, we compare mRNA vaccines to licensed
vaccines based on inactivated virus and demonstrate that
unmodified mRNA, formulated in optimized LNPs, fulfills all the
key requirements to be a viable vaccine platform for human
prophylaxis. We show for the first time that a single intramuscular
injection of non-replicating mRNA vaccines induces functional
antibody titers in NHPs comparable to or even higher than
vaccination with a full human dose of licensed vaccines based on
inactivated virus. The immune responses could be boosted and
stayed stable during an observation period of up to 1 year.
Moreover, we demonstrated the potential of mRNA vaccines as a
platform approach by successfully vaccinating the same animals
with multiple vaccines based on the same technology.
RESULTS
Unmodified mRNA in LNPs supports high antigen expression in
muscle cells and induces a pro-inflammatory environment
The induction of strong immune responses after intramuscular
injection of mRNA represents a very high hurdle due to a low
infiltration of muscle tissue by immune cells and the lack of
costimulatory molecules and optimal antigen presentation on
muscle cells. Thus, potent intramuscular mRNA vaccines must
allow high antigen expression and presentation and induce strong
immunostimulatory signals to improve immune cell infiltration. In
the last years LNPs have been extensively explored for in vivo
delivery of mRNA17 and have shown to be a promising non-viral
delivery system. Therefore, we used in our study unmodified,
sequence-optimized mRNA formulated with an optimized LNP
consisting of an ionizable amino lipid, phospholipid, cholesterol
and a polyethylene glycol (PEG) containing lipid.
We first analyzed the expression of the LNP-formulated mRNA
(mRNA/LNP) in muscle tissue using mRNA encoding the reporter
Photinus pyralis luciferase (PpLuc). Mice injected with PpLuc
mRNA/LNP showed at 24 and 48 h significantly higher intramus-
cular luciferase expression than animals that had received non-
formulated PpLuc mRNA (Fig. 1).
To gain first mechanistic insights into the mode of action of
mRNA/LNP vaccines we evaluated the activation of the innate
immune system, which is required to mount efficacious adaptive
immune responses after vaccination.18 To this end, cytokine and
chemokine concentrations were analyzed at the injection site and
in the draining lymph nodes (dLNs) after i.m. administration of
LNP-formulated mRNA encoding the rabies virus glycoprotein G
(RABV-G). In contrast to buffer or non-formulated mRNA, LNP-
formulated mRNA induced a pronounced but transient release of
the pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and IL-
6 (Fig. 2a, b) with peak concentrations at 14 h after injection.
Importantly, the increase in cytokine concentrations was pre-
dominantly local with systemic TNF concentrations below detec-
tion limit and only a transient increase in IL-6 concentrations. The
IL-6
concentrations
remained
10-fold
lower
in
the
serum
compared to the injection site and returned to baseline at 96 h
after injection (Fig. 2c). The higher concentrations at the injection
site and in the dLNs strongly suggest a local production of these
cytokines. However, as LNPs are efficient delivery vehicles to the
liver,19 a contribution of the liver to the increased systemic IL-6
concentrations cannot be excluded. Pro-inflammatory chemo-
kines, which are known to contribute to the recruitment and
subsequent
activation
of
distinct
immune
cells,
were
also
transiently induced at the injection site and in the dLNs by LNP-
formulated mRNA (Fig. 2d, e). Among the strongly upregulated
chemokines were MIP-1β, which plays a pivotal role in the
chemotaxis of macrophages, monocytes and NK cells, and CXCL-9,
which recruits T cells, NK cells and NKT cells to the site of
inflammation.20 Moreover, there was a transient elevation in the
concentrations of MCP-1, MIP-1α, and CXCL1, which attract a
variety of immune cells such as monocytes, macrophages,
dendritic cells and neutrophils (data not shown). We also observed
a transient increase in serum concentrations of the chemokines
described above, but to a much lower extent compared to those
detected at the injection site or in the dLNs (Fig. 2f).
To
elucidate
whether
the
pro-inflammatory
environment
translates into activation and changes in the composition of
immune cells, we next analyzed the number and activation status
of leukocytes in the dLNs. To ensure that any observed effect was
independent of the mRNA-encoded protein, we used a fluores-
cently labeled mRNA that cannot be translated (F*mRNA).
Intramuscular injection of the LNP-formulated F*mRNA induced
a strong increase in cellularity, which was absent after injection of

 unformulated F*mRNA (Fig. 2g). The strongest elevation in cell
numbers was observed 24 h after injection, except for NK cells
which increased over time. CD11b+ Gr1+ cells, consisting mainly of
monocytes and granulocytes, accounted for the largest increase in
leukocytes. Within 4 h after injection of LNP-formulated mRNA, we
observed a 10-fold increase in CD11b+ Gr1+ cells compared to
mice
treated
with
non-formulated
mRNA.
The
increase
in
cellularity in dLNs was accompanied by a strong activation of
both adaptive and innate immune cells, which peaked at 24 h
after injection, when more than 90% of the T and B cells expressed
the activation marker CD69 (Fig. 2h). Taken together, these results
suggest that i.m. injection of LNP-formulated mRNA vaccines
induces a broad but transient local immunostimulatory milieu,
which is relevant for the induction of strong adaptive immune
responses.
LNP-formulated mRNA induces strong humoral and cellular
responses in mice
Having demonstrated that LNP-formulated, optimized mRNA
administered i.m. supports high antigen expression and activates
innate immunity, we vaccinated BALB/c mice with the RABV-G
mRNA that has previously demonstrated protective efficacy after i.
d. application.7 A prime vaccination with a dose of 0.5 µg LNP-
formulated RABV-G mRNA already induced virus neutralization
titers (VNTs) above the WHO reference titer of 0.5 IU/ml, which is
used as correlate of protection in humans21 (Fig. 3a). These
neutralizing antibody titers increased more than 50-fold after a
second vaccination (Fig. 3b). The VNTs induced by 0.5 µg of LNP-
formulated mRNA were more than 250-fold higher (median 650
IU) compared to titers induced by 40 µg of non-formulated mRNA
(median
2.4 IU).
Additionally,
LNP-formulated
mRNA
led
to
stronger cellular immune responses, which was reflected by
significantly higher frequencies of antigen-specific multifunctional
CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (Fig. 3c, d) compared to non-formulated
mRNA.
Intramuscular vaccination with LNP-formulated mRNA leads to
long-lived humoral responses in NHPs
Next, we tested whether the strong immunogenicity of mRNA
vaccines in mice translates into higher-order species. To this end,

cytokine (a–c) or chemokine content (d–f) was measured in protein lysates and sera by cytometric bead array (CBA). g, h BALB/c mice (n = 3/

 we vaccinated cynomolgus monkeys with the LNP-formulated
unmodified RABV-G mRNA. A single i.m. immunization with 1 µg
LNP-formulated RABV-G mRNA already induced robust VNTs at or
above the WHO titer of 0.5 IU/ml in all animals at day 28 after
prime vaccination (Fig. 4a). The observed immunogenicity was
dose dependent with a 10-fold higher mRNA dose yielding 10-fold
higher VNTs.
To evaluate whether the primary responses could be boosted a
second vaccination with the RABV-G mRNA/LNP vaccine was
performed at day 28 resulting in a 20-fold increase in VNTs.
Monitoring the antibody titers for 6 months we could demon-
strate that after an initial decline neutralizing titers stabilized at a
level of about 40 IU/ml for the 10 µg mRNA dose and about 4 IU/
ml for the 1 µg mRNA dose (Fig. 4b). To demonstrate the existence
of B cell memory we vaccinated the same animals 5 months after
completed vaccination a third time with RABV-G mRNA/LNPs
(recall vaccination) and measured antibody titers 5 days later. In
both dose groups we observed a very rapid 10-fold increase in
VNTs, demonstrating the induction of a strong recall-response by
the mRNA vaccine (Fig. 4c).
To confirm the platform potential of our mRNA vaccination
technology, we produced a vaccine encoding hemagglutinin (HA)
of the influenza virus strain H1N1pdm09. Naïve NHPs were
vaccinated with 10 µg of the H1N1-HA mRNA/LNP vaccine and
functional antibodies against the influenza H1N1 virus were
measured by a hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay. After just a
single vaccination, we observed H1N1-HI titers at or above 1:40,
which is used as correlate of protection in humans21 (Fig. 4d). A
second dose of the H1N1-HA mRNA/LNP vaccine strongly
increased the H1N1-HI titers, which again after an initial decline
stabilized at a titer of about 640 (Fig. 4e). Importantly, all
vaccinated animals maintained H1N1-HI titers clearly above the
protective limit for 5 months starting after prime vaccination
pointing to longevity of the mRNA-mediated humoral response.
The NHPs were then used to test an explorative non-LNP
formulation and were vaccinated at days 182 and 210 with an
mRNA encoding HA of the influenza virus strain H3N2 in an
explorative non-LNP formulation. In contrast to the LNP formula-
tion, the non-LNP formulation did not induce antigen-specific
humoral responses and no H3N2-HI titers could be detected after
prime or boost vaccination (Supplementary Fig. 1). The H1N1-HI
titers were not changed by the non-immunogenic H3N2-HA
vaccination. A continued follow-up of the H1N1-HI titers demon-
strated stable H1N1-HI titers induced by the primary H1N1-HA

LNP-formulated mRNA vaccines are capable of competing with
licensed vaccines in NHPs
To test whether mRNA vaccines represent a competitive platform
for vaccine development, we compared in NHPs the immuno-
genicity of the RABV-G mRNA/LNP vaccine and an H3N2-HA
mRNA/LNP vaccine to already licensed vaccines based on
inactivated virus, namely Rabipur® and Fluad®. We compared the
potency of the vaccines to prime effective immune responses, as
well as their capability to boost immune responses. The RABV-G
mRNA/LNP vaccine induced after a single vaccination neutralizing
antibody titers above 0.5 IU/ml, which were comparable (for the
10 µg mRNA dose) or higher (for the 100 µg mRNA dose) than the
VNTs induced by a full human dose of Rabipur® (Fig. 5a). Four
weeks after a single shot vaccination median VNTs measured for
mRNA vaccines were 4.9 IU/ml for the 10 µg dose and 71.2 IU/ml
for the 100 µg dose, compared to 1.8 IU/ml for Rabipur®. Antibody
titers of all groups benefited from a second vaccination given at
day 28, and VNTs (measured on day 49) induced by 100 µg of
mRNA vaccine reached a median of 842 IU/ml, outperforming
Rabipur® more than 20-fold (median 31.3 IU/ml). As the recom-
mended pre-exposure vaccination schedule for Rabipur® implies
three administrations conducted on days 0, 7 and 28,22 we also
included this group. However, the additional vaccination with
Rabipur® on day 7 did also not result in higher VNTs at day 49 than
after two mRNA vaccine administrations. These data suggest that
the vaccination schedule with two injections of the LNP-
formulated mRNA vaccine is sufficient to induce protection
against rabies infections. For the 100 µg dose of LNP-formulated
RABV-G mRNA, which exceeded the WHO titer of 0.5 IU/ml by 20
to 200-fold at day 28, even a single administration may already be
sufficient to induce protective and sustained antibody titers.
The
mRNA
technology
was
also
competitive
when
we
compared an H3N2-HA mRNA/LNP vaccine in NHPs to the potent
flu vaccine Fluad® for the season 2016/17. Fluad® contains the
surface antigens HA and neuraminidase of the influenza strains
H1N1, H3N2 and B/Brisbane, as well as the adjuvant MF59C.1. A
single dose of the H3N2-HA mRNA/LNP vaccine was sufficient to
induce H3N2-HI titers, which were above the titer of 1:40 and
comparable to titers induced by a full human dose of Fluad®.

 A second dose of both vaccines further increased the titers, to yet
higher titers for the mRNA/LNP vaccine.
Finally, we compared the mRNA/LNP vaccines with the licensed
vaccines in their capability to induce T cell responses in NHPs. An
intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) analysis of PBMCs of the rabies-
vaccinated animals at day 35, i.e., seven days after the last
vaccination, detected specific cellular responses after mRNA/LNP
vaccination but not in Rabipur®-vaccinated animals. RABV-G-
specific multifunctional IFN-γ+/IL-2+ CD4+ T cells, which are
associated with strong anti-viral responses,23 were observed for
both mRNA vaccine doses, whereas RABV-G-specific IFN-γ+/GrzB+
CD8+ T cells, which are dedicated cytolytic cells,24 were detected
only in animals receiving the 100 µg dose (Fig. 5c, d, Supplemen-
tary Fig. 2). In the influenza-vaccinated animals H3N2-HA-specific
IFN-γ+/IL-2+ CD4+ T cells were observed at day 35 only for the
mRNA/LNP vaccine but not for Fluad® (Fig. 5e). H3N2-HA-specific
CD8+ T cell responses were absent in both cases.
mRNA vaccines exhibit a favorable safety profile
Favorable tolerability and safety are critical requirements for
prophylactic vaccines. To address these aspects we analyzed in
the NHPs the reactogenicity at the injection site, systemic cytokine
and chemokine concentrations, body weight, and body tempera-
ture after i.m. vaccination with 1, 10, and 100 µg LNP-formulated
mRNA. Injection sites showed only slight erythema and/or edema
in some of the animals, which resolved 1 to 6 days after injection
(Table 1). No pain on palpation was observed. Systemic cytokine
concentrations after vaccination stayed for most animals and time
points below the detection limit (IL-1β, IL-4, IL-5, IFN-γ and TNF) or
did not increase significantly above pre-dose concentrations (IL-2,
IL-8 and G-CSF) (Supplementary Fig. 3a and data not shown). IL-6
was absent in almost all animals that received the 1 or 10 µg dose.

 Vaccination with the 100 µg dose induced at 24 h in all animals a
low increase in IL-6 concentrations. Body temperatures, which
varied considerably among animals and studies, did not display
obvious differences between NHPs that had received the mRNA/
LNP vaccines or the licensed vaccines (Supplementary Fig. 3b).
Similarly, no changes in food consumption or body weight were
associated
with
any
dose
(data
not
shown).
These
data
demonstrate a good tolerability of the mRNA/LNP vaccines in
NHPs and confirm the observations in mice, where systemic
release of TNF or IL-6 was absent or low, respectively.
DISCUSSION
mRNA is a very promising and versatile vaccination approach,
which has recently attracted substantial attention. We have
previously demonstrated that i.d. administration of protamine-
formulated prophylactic mRNA vaccines based on unmodified
nucleosides can protect mice against influenza or rabies challenge
infections and induces also in ferrets and pigs strong humoral
responses.7,8 Recent studies using chemically modified mRNA
revealed protective efficacy of LNP-formulated mRNA vaccines for
Zika virus after i.m. administration in mice or i.d. administration
in NHPs, as well as immunogenicity for influenza HA of the
strains H10N8 and H7N9 after i.m. administration in NHPs and
humans.12–15 In general, in vitro transcribed mRNA has the risk of
triggering various pattern recognition receptors in the endosome
(e.g., TLR7/8) or the cytoplasm (e.g., RIG-I), which lead to an anti-
viral response, followed by a shutdown of translation that can
lower expression of the mRNA-encoded protein.25 To overcome
that
problem,
the
Zika
studies
used
mRNA
harboring
1-
methylpseudouridine (m1Ψ) which has been demonstrated to
reduce immunostimulation and increase protein expression.26
However, such an unnatural modification may raise safety
concerns and increase regulatory hurdles. Therefore, as an
alternative approach, we used mRNAs containing only unmodified
nucleosides and applied instead sequence-optimization and UTR
screening to avoid inappropriate immunostimulation and to
achieve high antigen expression.16 Nevertheless, for potency
reasons it is strongly desired to equip a vaccine with a sufficient
adjuvant effect, which also applies to mRNA vaccines. The specific
challenge in this context is the fact that mRNA vaccines need to
be taken up by the cells and require the cellular translation
machinery to provide antigen, a process that can be inhibited by
excessive or improper immunostimulatory activity. Therefore, it is
necessary to find a combination of mRNA, supporting efficient
antigen production, and formulation partner, providing sufficient
adjuvant effects and enhancing cellular delivery of the nucleic
acids, which does not interfere with antigen expression. Data
presented in the current work demonstrate that such a combina-
tion is feasible. The specific approach we describe here yields
strong immunogenicity in NHPs, which is even superior to
licensed vaccines based on inactivated virus.
We observed that i.m. application of unmodified mRNA in
optimized LNPs led to high expression of the encoded protein in
mice, which translated into strong humoral and cellular immune
responses. Several mechanisms have been described how LNPs
containing ionizable amino lipids could enhance cellular delivery
of nucleic acids.27 Firstly, they self-assemble with the polyanionic
mRNA to form particles, which provide protection of the mRNA
from RNases and improve uptake of the mRNA by endocytosis.
Secondly, they facilitate the endosomal escape of mRNA and its
access to the cytoplasm where it is translated into protein. By
analyzing the injection site and the dLNs, we revealed that LNP
formulation additionally led to the activation of innate immune
responses, which support the induction of cellular and humoral
responses. The observed increase in cellularity and the strong
activation of immune cells in the dLNs even when a non-
translatable mRNA was used suggest that the observed effect is
independent of the encoded antigen. Interestingly, the increase in
cellularity was mostly mediated by monocytes and granulocytes
and may support the transport and/or presentation of the antigen
in the dLNs. Further investigations are required to elucidate,
whether these cells are indeed contributing to the antigen
transport to the dLNs.
After demonstrating strong immunogenicity of mRNA/LNP
vaccines in mice, we tested whether this also translates to NHPs,
which mimic the human situation most closely. This is particularly
important given the experiences with early DNA vaccines which
showed promising results in small animals that were then difficult
to translate into clinical success.28 Intramuscular vaccination of
NHPs with mRNA/LNP vaccines encoding RABV-G as well as
influenza HA of the strains H1N1 and H3N2 induced long lasting
antibody responses, which were monitored for up to 1 year and
were maintained during this period well above the titers that
serve as correlate of protection. Importantly, the threshold titers
were already achieved after a single vaccination suggesting that
the vaccines could be used as single shot vaccines, which is
especially important for vaccination campaigns in low resource
settings. It should be noted that the animals were naïve regarding
the vaccinated influenza strains, indicating induction of de novo
immune responses after mRNA vaccination. This is in contrast to
the human situation, where most adult individuals have already
been primed by previous exposure to or vaccinations with
heterologous strains and might respond even better to the
vaccination.
An important finding of our study is that LNP-formulated mRNA
can be used as a platform technology, which does not induce anti-
vector immunity that can be observed with viral vectors such as
adenoviruses.29 Instead, it allows multiple vaccinations targeting
different pathogens. The animals presented in Fig. 4 were
vaccinated first with the H1N1-HA mRNA/LNP vaccine and three
weeks after boost with the RABV-G mRNA/LNP vaccine. Never-
theless, they mounted immune responses against both antigens.
The maintenance of the H1N1-HI titers during the RABV-G mRNA
vaccinations and the induction of high titers of rabies neutralizing
antibodies in H1N1-HA-vaccinated animals using the same vaccine
format suggest that LNP-formulated mRNA enables multiple
prophylactic vaccinations. Similarly important is the observation
that LNPs, which were originally developed to deliver siRNA27 and
have already demonstrated their safety for intravenous adminis-
tration in clinical trials,30 are also well tolerated in NHPs after i.m.
administration in combination with unmodified mRNA. We
observed only limited reactogenicity at the injection site and
minor
changes
in
systemic
cytokine
and
chemokine
concentrations.
mRNA vaccines can be produced relatively quickly by a generic
manufacturing process, which makes them attractive in scenarios
where a vaccine must be adapted to match a mutated virus
sequence like the annual update of the influenza vaccine.2
However, they can also complement already existing vaccines
which
can
be
costly
and
difficult
to
produce.
Here,
we
demonstrate that mRNA vaccines can compete with or even
outperform licensed vaccines. The mRNA/LNP vaccines induced
even CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses against RABV-G and CD4+ T
cell responses against H3N2-HA, which were absent in NHPs that
had received the licensed vaccines Rabipur® or Fluad® and have,
to our best knowledge, for prophylactic mRNA vaccines only been
detected in NHPs after vaccination with self-amplifying mRNA31
but not with non-amplifying mRNA.
In summary, we demonstrated that intramuscular application of
LNP-formulated prophylactic mRNA vaccines based on sequence-
optimized, unmodified nucleosides leads to a strong induction of
local innate immune responses and systemic adaptive immune
responses. The vaccines were well tolerated in NHPs and induced
long-lived functional antibody responses that correlated with
protection for rabies and influenza virus. Notably, the humoral and

 cellular immune responses in NHP induced by mRNA/LNP
vaccines against rabies and influenza H3N2 were superior to the
licensed vaccines Rabipur® and Fluad®, respectively. These data
open new avenues for accelerated vaccine development in the
field of infectious diseases. In conclusion, the mRNA technology
evaluated in the present study fulfills all requirements of a viable
vaccine platform and thus warrants clinical testing in the near
future.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
mRNA vaccines
All mRNA vaccines were based on the RNActive® platform (claimed and
described in patents WO2012019780 and US20150104476). mRNA vectors
contained a 5′ cap structure, 5′ UTR, open reading frame (ORF), 3′ UTR,
polyA tail and did not include chemically modified nucleosides. In brief,
optimization
entailed
GC-enrichment
of
the
open
reading
frame
(US20150104476) and inclusion of enhanced UTRs (WO2013143700,
WO2013143698, WO2013143699). The rabies mRNA vaccine encodes the
glycoprotein (RABV-G) of the Pasteur strain (GenBank accession number:
AAA47218.1). Two different optimized mRNA constructs were used for
immunization (RABV-G A for Figs. 3–5, and RABV-G B for Fig. 4; mRNA
sequences see ref. 7) containing the same ORF but different UTRs. The
influenza mRNA vaccines encode full-length HA from influenza A/Nether-
lands/602/2009 (H1N1)
(GenBank: CY039527.2; mRNA sequence see
Re6HA8) or A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 (H3N2) (GISAID: EPI643118; mRNA
sequence available upon request). The mRNAs were produced by T7-
polymerase-based in vitro run-off transcription.32,33 Lipid nanoparticle
(LNP)-formulated mRNA was generated using LNPs provided by Acuitas
Therapeutics (Canada). The LNPs used in this study are 70–100 nm particles,
prepared using an ionizable amino lipid, phospholipid, cholesterol and a
PEGylated lipid, and are similar in composition to the LNPs that have
recently proven to be safe and efficient tools for siRNA delivery.16,27,34
Animals
Mice (BALB/c, 7–9 weeks of age) were obtained from Janvier Laboratories
(Le Genest-Saint-Isle, France). Experiments were approved by the Regional
council Tübingen. Studies with cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis)
were conducted at Envigo CRS, S.A.U., Santa Perpètua de Mogoda, Spain.
Animals were of Vietnamese origin, bred in captivity, nulliparous and not
pregnant. Animals had at treatment start an age of 2.5–3.5 years and a
body weight of 2.2–3.3 kg. All animal experiments were conducted in
accordance with German (mice) and Spanish (NHPs) laws and guidelines
for animal protection. Mice were vaccinated i.m. at days 0 and 21 into the
tibialis anterior muscle with a single dose of 25 µl. NHPs were vaccinated i.
m. at days 0 and 28 into the biceps femoris muscle with a single dose of
500 µl. Vaccination with the licensed human rabies vaccine Rabipur®
(Novartis) was performed i.m. in NHPs with the full human dose according
to the pre-exposure prophylaxis schedule on days 0, 7, and 2822 or on a
reduced schedule on days 0 and 28.
Antibody analysis
Functional anti-HA antibody titers were analyzed by HI assay. NHP sera
were incubated with receptor destroying enzyme (RDEII, Denka Seiken) at
37 C overnight, inactivated (56 °C, 60 min) and incubated with kaolin.
Dilutions of pre-treated sera were incubated for 45 min with 4 HAU of
inactivated influenza A/California/7/2009 (H1N1) or A/Hong Kong/4801/
2014 (H3N2) virus (NIBSC, UK) and 50 μl 0.5% CRBC was added. Mouse sera
were treated as described.7 Anti-rabies VNTs in serum were analyzed by
the Eurovir® Hygiene-Labor GmbH, Germany, using the FAVN test and the
Standard Challenge Virus CVS-11 according to WHO protocol.
Intracellular cytokine staining (ICS)
Induction of antigen-specific T cells was determined using ICS. PBMCs of
NHPs were collected 7 days after boost vaccination, shipped over-night at
20 °C, enriched by density gradient centrifugation, and stimulated for 6 h in
presence of anti-CD28 (clone CD28.2, 10 µg/ml) and anti-CD49d (clone
9F10, 10 µg/ml) antibodies and either an overlapping peptide library
covering the RABV-G protein (custom made by JPT, 10 µg/peptide/ml) or
media. Golgi-Plug (BD Biosciences) was added after 1 h. Cell surface
staining was performed using antibodies against CD3e (APC-Cy7, clone
SP34-2), CD4 (BV650, clone OKt4) and CD8 (PE-Cy7, clone RPA-T8).
Intracellular staining was performed using antibodies against IL-2 (BV421,
clone MQ1-17H12), IFN-γ (FITC, B27) and Granzyme B (APC, clone GB11).
Aqua Dye was used to distinguish live/dead cells (Invitrogen). Cells were
acquired using a Canto II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and flow
cytometry data were analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star). ICS of
mouse splenocytes was performed as decribed.7
Cytokine and chemokine measurements
Plasma of NHPs was analyzed for inflammation biomarkers (G-CSF, IFNγ, IL-
1β, IL-2, IL 4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF) using the Luminex-based
PRCYTOMAG-40K kit (MD MILLIPORE). Serum samples and muscle or dLN
protein lysates of mice were analyzed for cytokines and chemokines as
described.35
Flow cytometric analysis of dLNs
BALB/c mice were injected i.m. in both legs with 10 µg non-formulated or
LNP-formulated F*mRNA (5′-Aminoallyl-UTP-modified mRNA labeled with
Alexa Fluor® 647 NHS ester from ThermoFisher), or with buffer control.
Right and left popliteal and inguinal draining LNs were isolated and
analyzed by flow cytometry as described.35
Statistical analyses
Analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism software, Version 6.05.
Statistical
differences
between
groups
were
assessed
by
the
Mann–Whitney test.
