Abstract: Eggs contain high quality protein, vitamins, minerals and antioxidants, yet regular
consumption is still met with uncertainty. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to compare
the effects of consuming two eggs per day or a heart-healthy oatmeal breakfast on biomarkers of
cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk and satiety measures in a young, healthy population. Fifty subjects
participated in a randomized crossover clinical intervention; subjects were randomly allocated to
consume either two eggs or one packet of oatmeal per day for breakfast for four weeks. After a
three-week washout period, participants were allocated to the alternative breakfast. Fasting blood
samples were collected at the end of each intervention period to assess plasma lipids and plasma
ghrelin. Subjects completed visual analog scales (VAS) concurrent to dietary records to assess satiety
and hunger. Along with an increase in cholesterol intake, there were significant increases in both
low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol following the egg
consumption period (p < 0.01). However, there was no difference in the LDL/HDL ratio, a recognized
biomarker of CVD risk, nor in the plasma glucose, triglycerides or liver enzymes, between diet
periods. Several self-reported satiety measures were increased following the consumption of eggs,
which were associated with lower plasma ghrelin concentrations (p < 0.05). These results demonstrate
that compared to an oatmeal breakfast, two eggs per day do not adversely affect the biomarkers
associated with CVD risk, but increase satiety throughout the day in a young healthy population.

1. Introduction
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is currently the leading cause of death among adult men and
women in the United States [1]. In order to prevent its development, beneficial diet and lifestyle habits
should be implemented while young and healthy. Habitual breakfast consumption has been associated
with a healthy lifestyle and good nutritional status, while studies have reported it to be predictive of
lower body mass index (BMI), and inversely related to obesity later in life [2,3]. Whole eggs, which are
typically consumed as a breakfast food, are inexpensive, readily available, and contain high quality
proteins, essential vitamins and minerals, as well as the antioxidant carotenoids lutein and zeaxanthin,
lecithin, choline and cholesterol [4]. In the past, whole egg consumption has been controversial, due
to the cholesterol content of eggs (~185–200 mg/egg), although this amount of dietary cholesterol

has been long since identified as a non-significant independent risk factor for CVD [5]. Currently, the
American Heart Association is recommending egg whites without the yolks as a heart-healthy source
of protein [6], despite the removal of the 300 mg/day limit of dietary cholesterol in the 2015–2020
Dietary Guidelines for Americans [7]. The negative connotation associated with dietary cholesterol
has been challenged by numerous studies demonstrating the lack of increased biomarkers associated
with risk of CVD and the beneficial effects of daily egg consumption [8–10]. Whole egg consumption
studies have not only resulted in the absence of increases in factors associated with CVD risk but also
in improved markers of chronic inflammation, glucose intolerance, and insulin resistance in several
distinct populations: children, individuals with metabolic syndrome and people with diabetes [11–14].
A previous study showed that the consumption of one egg per day reduces insulin resistance and
contributes to higher weight loss associated with increased satiety [15]. In several studies, when
compared to an isoenergetic, equal-weight breakfast, an egg-based breakfast has been shown to
increase satiety and decrease energy intake [13,16,17]. Satiety, or the feeling of satisfaction, can be
measured objectively, by biochemical measures, or subjectively by self-report. Increased satiety can
lead to changes in nutrient intake patterns, which can have favorable roles in the reduction of CVD
risk [18–20]. Specifically, ghrelin, a growth hormone—releasing peptide secreted by the stomach in a
fasted state, promotes food intake and has roles in energy balance and weight maintenance, as well as
proposed roles in various body systems [21]. The regulation of this hormone is effected by both chronic
energy balance and acute feeding. It is a marker for increased appetite, and is associated with a counter
hormone, leptin, which has been implicated in the regulation of adipocyte homeostasis [18,22,23].
Decreased levels of ghrelin have been related to decreased appetite and can increase weight loss [24,25].
For the purpose of this study, whole egg consumption was compared to oatmeal consumption.
Oatmeal is also a good source of fiber, B vitamins, iron, magnesium, and selenium, and an American
Heart Association “certified heart healthy food” [26]. The main benefit of oatmeal for CVD protection
is the ability to lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), which can be attributed to its
soluble fiber content [27]. The main objective of this study was to investigate the effects of two different
breakfasts on anthropometrics, dietary patterns, lipid profile, and satiety in a healthy population in
order to evaluate the biomarkers of CVD risk and effect on appetite. We hypothesized that compared
to daily consumption of oatmeal, the intake of two eggs per day would not result in changes of CVD
risk biomarkers, but would increase satiety in a young, healthy population.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Experimental Design
Fifty healthy individuals (26 females and 24 males) between the ages of 18–30 years were recruited
to participate in an 11-week, randomized, crossover, intervention study. Participants were mainly
college students recruited from the University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT and young professionals
from local surrounding communities. Based on the standard deviation from our previous studies and
using a Z value of 1.96 (95% confidence interval) we estimated that 40 subjects would be sufficient to
observe differences in plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) between groups [11,12,15].
We recruited 50 subjects to allow for attrition. The study took place between August–December 2014.
Participants signed a written, informed consent form prior to any measures or experimental
procedures. Inclusion criteria included age (18–30 years), body mass index (BMI) (18.5–29.9 kg/m2)
and willingness to consume the intervention foods daily.
Exclusion criteria included plasma triglycerides (TG) > 500 mg/dL, total cholesterol
(TC) > 240 mg/dL or glucose (GLU) > 126 mg/dL. Current or previous history of liver disease, renal
disease, diabetes, cancer, endocrine disorders, metabolic disorders, stroke or heart disease, taking
glucose lowering drugs or supplements, current pregnancy or lactation, BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2, blood
pressure > 140/90, egg or gluten allergy/sensitivity or celiac disease. All analysis was performed
blinded to breakfast allocation. All visits took place in the Nutritional Sciences Department at the
 Nutrients 2017, 9, 89

University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board
at the University of Connecticut (protocol #H14-032). This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov
as NCT02181244.
2.2. Dietary Intervention
Enrolled participants were randomly allocated to consume either two eggs per day (EGGS) or
one packet of oatmeal per day (OATS) for four weeks (Big Y Foods, Inc., Springfield, MA, USA).
Following a three-week washout, participants crossed over to the alternate intervention food for four
weeks. Each daily serving of two eggs contained 370 mg cholesterol, 0 g carbohydrate, 12 g protein,
10 g fat, 0 g fiber and 140 calories. Each daily serving of one packet of oatmeal had 0 mg cholesterol,
0–14 g carbohydrate, 3–4 g protein, 1.5–2 g fat, 3 g fiber and 100–160 calories depending on the flavor
choice, of which there were five. Participants were instructed to consume the intervention foods as the
first meal of the day, and were allowed to add vegetables, meat, cheese, syrup, yogurt, etc. to their
breakfast intervention food, if desired. Participant compliance was monitored daily by self-report and
bi-weekly visits to our laboratory for product pickup. During the intervention and washout periods,
participants were asked to avoid consuming whole eggs or foods containing predominately eggs or
oats. Aside from treatment, habitual dietary intake, exercise, medication usage, and supplement intake
was maintained throughout the study.
2.3. Blood Collection and Processing
After a 12 h overnight fast, blood was drawn at baseline, and at the end of each dietary period.
Whole blood was collected from participants in EDTA and SST blood collection tubes and was
centrifuged at 2000× g for 20 min at 4 ◦C. Plasma and serum were collected and aliquots were placed
at −80 ◦C for storage.
2.4. Anthropometrics, Blood Pressure, Waist Circumference, and Dietary Intake
Anthropometric measures of weight, height, BMI, and waist circumference (WC), and dietary
intake were collected from participants at the end of each dietary period. Weight was measured to
the nearest 0.1 kg, height to the nearest centimeter, and BMI was calculated. Blood pressure (BP)
was measured with an automated blood pressure monitor (Omron, Healthcare Inc., Bannockburn,
IL, USA) after a 5 min rest. The average of three separate recordings is reported. WC was measured
on bare skin, at the top of the iliac crest to the nearest 0.1 cm. The average of 3 separate recordings
is reported. Subjects were responsible for recording all food and beverages consumed, for two
non-consecutive weekdays and one weekend day. Dietary intake was analyzed using Nutrition Data
System for Research (NDSR) 2014 (Nutrition Coordinating Center, University of Minnesota) to quantify
macronutrient, micronutrient and carotenoid intake, glycemic index, and glycemic load.
2.5. Plasma Lipids, Glucose, and Liver Enzymes
Fasting plasma samples from the end of each intervention period were analyzed for TC, HDL-C,
TG, GLU, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels. Samples were
measured using an automated clinical chemistry analyzer (Cobas c111, Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis,
IN, USA), LDL-C was estimated using the Friedewald equation [28].
2.6. Measures of Satiety
Satiety was analyzed by subjective (satiety visual analog (VAS) scales) and objective (plasma
ghrelin) measurements. Participants completed corresponding VAS on the same days as the three-day
dietary intake records [15]. Satiety scales were completed prior to breakfast, lunch and dinner. Each
VAS questionnaire was composed of eight open-ended questions regarding hunger, satisfaction,
fullness, satiety and taste preference for savory, salty, sweet, or fatty foods. The VAS was a 10 cm

line, ranging from “not at all” to “yes very much”. Participants marked along the line indicating their
feelings, which was then assigned a quantifiable value by measuring from the beginning of the line to
where the participant had marked. Values were recorded to the tenth position for analysis. To measure
ghrelin, fasting plasma from the end of each intervention period was acidified with 1 M hydrochloric
acid to retain stability at −80 ◦C. Total ghrelin was quantified using a sandwich ELISA kit, (Mercodia
AB, Uppsala, Sweden).
2.7. Statistical Analysis
All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 22. Paired t-tests were used to assess
differences between dietary treatments and baseline values were used as a covariate. Data are reported
as mean ± SD unless noted otherwise. p < 0.05 was considered significant.

percentage of calories from carbohydrates decreased (p < 0.001), (Table 2). The intake of both saturated
fatty acids (SFA) and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) was increased with egg consumption
(p < 0.001), while there was no difference in the intake of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) between
treatment groups. As expected, the dietary cholesterol intake was increased during the EGGS period
(p < 0.001). Comparatively, the total and soluble fiber intake was significantly increased during the
OATS period (p < 0.05). Despite egg yolks serving as a bioavailable source of lutein and zeaxanthin [29],
there was no difference in the dietary intake of the carotenoids lutein and zeaxanthin between the EGGS
and OATS periods. Similarly, no changes in the glycemic index were observed between treatments,
whereas the glycemic load was decreased during the EGGS period (p < 0.05) (Table 2).

prior to consuming dinner than participants consuming oatmeal, suggesting a prolonged effect of egg 
intake on satiety throughout the day (Figure 2a). Participants consuming eggs felt more of a desire to

or savory for breakfast, as compared to participants consuming oatmeal for breakfast (Figure 2c,d).  
We further aimed to examine an objective measure of satiety. Following four weeks of eggs 
consumption for breakfast, fasting plasma ghrelin was significantly decreased as compared to an 
oatmeal breakfast, indicating less feelings of hunger upon waking as compared to an oatmeal 
breakfast (Figure 3). A negative correlation was identified between ghrelin and BMI, indicating an 
association between the biological indication of hunger and body weight (Figure 4).

4. Discussion 
Despite the recent removal of the dietary cholesterol intake limit [30], habitual egg consumption 
remains controversial and misunderstood by the general public. Therefore, the purpose of this study 
was to determine whether an egg‐based breakfast as compared to a certified heart‐healthy breakfast 
of oatmeal would increase the biomarkers associated with CVD risk and affect appetite in a young, 
healthy population. Although there was an increase in both LDL‐C and HDL‐C, we found the 
consumption of two eggs per day as compared to an oatmeal breakfast did not increase the LDL‐
C/HDL‐C ratio, while increasing satiety as measured by fasting plasma ghrelin and VAS.  
The impact of dietary cholesterol on plasma lipids varies among individuals, potentially due to 
variations in the negative feedback regulation of endogenous cholesterol production in response to 
cholesterol intake [31]. In this study, the consumption of two eggs per day did raise TC levels, 
corresponding to the increased intake of dietary cholesterol as compared to oatmeal. Notably, egg‐
induced increases in TC are related to concurrent increases in both LDL‐C and HDL‐C, which has 
been observed in previous egg studies [12,32,33]. The maintenance of the LDL‐C/HDL‐C ratio, an 
accepted CVD prediction model, does not impact CVD risk, which, in contrast to previous 
epidemiological studies that associated egg consumption with increased LDL‐C only, then 
extrapolated that data to an increased risk of CVD with egg intake [34].  
This concurrent increase in HDL‐C may be suggestive of improved reverse cholesterol transport 
(RCT) because it is indicative of greater amounts of cholesterol being removed from the tissues [35]. 
It is hypothesized that the phospholipids from eggs are involved in this modulation of RCT by

Despite the recent removal of the dietary cholesterol intake limit [30], habitual egg consumption 
remains controversial and misunderstood by the general public. Therefore, the purpose of this study 
was to determine whether an egg‐based breakfast as compared to a certified heart‐healthy breakfast 
of oatmeal would increase the biomarkers associated with CVD risk and affect appetite in a young, 
healthy population. Although there was an increase in both LDL‐C and HDL‐C, we found the 
consumption of two eggs per day as compared to an oatmeal breakfast did not increase the LDL‐
C/HDL‐C ratio, while increasing satiety as measured by fasting plasma ghrelin and VAS.  
The impact of dietary cholesterol on plasma lipids varies among individuals, potentially due to 
variations in the negative feedback regulation of endogenous cholesterol production in response to 
cholesterol intake [31]. In this study, the consumption of two eggs per day did raise TC levels, 
corresponding to the increased intake of dietary cholesterol as compared to oatmeal. Notably, egg‐
induced increases in TC are related to concurrent increases in both LDL‐C and HDL‐C, which has 
been observed in previous egg studies [12,32,33]. The maintenance of the LDL‐C/HDL‐C ratio, an 
accepted CVD prediction model, does not impact CVD risk, which, in contrast to previous 
epidemiological studies that associated egg consumption with increased LDL‐C only, then 
extrapolated that data to an increased risk of CVD with egg intake [34].  
This concurrent increase in HDL‐C may be suggestive of improved reverse cholesterol transport 
(RCT) because it is indicative of greater amounts of cholesterol being removed from the tissues [35]. 
It is hypothesized that the phospholipids from eggs are involved in this modulation of RCT by

been observed in previous egg studies [12,32,33]. The maintenance of the LDL-C/HDL-C ratio,
an accepted CVD prediction model, does not impact CVD risk, which, in contrast to previous
epidemiological studies that associated egg consumption with increased LDL-C only, then extrapolated
that data to an increased risk of CVD with egg intake [34].
This concurrent increase in HDL-C may be suggestive of improved reverse cholesterol transport
(RCT) because it is indicative of greater amounts of cholesterol being removed from the tissues [35].
It is hypothesized that the phospholipids from eggs are involved in this modulation of RCT by
impacting the HDL size and function, as well as the expression of hepatic HDL uptake receptors [36].
In a human clinical trial, ex vivo cholesterol efflux, the critical first step of RCT, was found to be
increased following egg consumption [37]. Two large meta-analyses have reported no association
between regular egg consumption and the risk of CVD, myocardial infarction or stroke in the general
population [38,39]. Thus, although TC, LDL-C and HDL-C levels were increased following egg
consumption, regulatory mechanisms may have compensated for the added dietary cholesterol and
biomarkers of CVD risk remained unchanged in this population.
Our results reported the increased consumption of protein and fat throughout the day, with no
impact on the total energy intake or change in body weight following the consumption of two eggs
at breakfast. High-protein diets have been found to increase energy expenditure, and promote a
negative energy balance [17]. In a study in healthy individuals who consumed low- or high-protein
diets, with sustained carbohydrate consumption (50%), researchers found a decrease in appetite and
caloric intake with high-protein intake. In our study, a decrease in hunger and an increase in fullness
were seen between weeks 3 and 4 of the isocaloric high-protein diet; however, a decrease in caloric
intake was sustained for the ad libitum high-protein leg of the study. This correlated with increased
plasma ghrelin over time. Although this study did not reduce the amount of carbohydrates in the
diet, we found similar results to a high-protein diet with a decreased carbohydrate intake as well [18].
The glycemic load is an accurate measure of the degree to which carbohydrate-containing foods will
affect plasma glucose levels [40]. Reductions in glycemic load have previously been associated with
carbohydrate-restricted diets and egg consumption [41]. The reduction in carbohydrates following
the consumption of eggs is the likely cause of the reduction in the glycemic load, which has been
implicated in the control of glucose and lipid metabolism [42].
Protein increases satiety and thus may explain the decrease in ghrelin levels.
In a study
investigating the effect of protein intake on the plasma ghrelin concentration, there was a significant
reduction in ghrelin over time when consuming higher-protein diets compared to carbohydrate
diets [18]. A study in children and adolescents evaluated satiety at lunchtime following either an
egg or bagel breakfast [43]. There were no significant differences in dietary intake at lunchtime in
either group, according to dietary intake analysis and VAS. However, the peptide YY (PYY) was
increased following egg consumption, which is also suggestive of increased satiety. This increase was
observed often after consuming foods higher in protein and fat. The authors attributed the lack of
correlation between dietary consumption and ghrelin levels to the children’s ability to self-regulate
food intake better than adolescents and adults [44]. Conversely, a study investigating the impact
of macronutrient intake on levels of cortisol, which stimulates food intake, found decreased levels
throughout the day following the intake of protein and fat as compared to carbohydrates [45]. Equally,
the intake of carbohydrates for breakfast caused an increase in the cortisol concentration, which may
be related to increased feelings of hunger throughout the day. Eating comfort food, high in sugar,
is proposed to cause stress that further increases cortisol concentrations throughout the day [45].
Ghrelin is down-regulated in positive energy balance, and up-regulated in negative energy balance,
in healthy-weight individuals [46]. Tschop et al. [43,47] also reported a negative correlation between
fasting ghrelin and percent body fat. In our study, we found similar results, with those individuals
with higher BMIs having the lowest plasma ghrelin. This can be attributed to a negative feedback
mechanism, in which the body is attempting to maintain energy balance homeostasis and the regulation
of feeding [48].

Following egg consumption, we likewise observed decreased circulating ghrelin. This may be
related to the increased protein intake as a result of egg intake. Egg protein has the highest biological
value of any other protein at an 88–95/100 rating, indicating the presence of all amino acids, both
dispensable and indispensable. High-biological-value proteins have been suggested to delay gastric
emptying and to have a stronger effect on decreasing post-prandial ghrelin concentrations [24]. Ghrelin
also follows a diurnal pattern, dipping around 2 p.m. and steadily increasing as the night continues,
which can be implicated in hunger upon waking [47]. From comparing our results, in which we
observed decreased plasma ghrelin and increased satisfaction at dinnertime with egg consumption,
we can hypothesize that eggs play a long-term role in satiety. In a study investigating the effect of
protein intake on plasma ghrelin concentrations, there was a significant reduction in ghrelin over time
when consuming higher-protein diets as compared to carbohydrate diets [49]. This may be due to the
satiating effects of protein and the impact of easy digestion. In the case of egg consumption, the high
biological value helps with the digestibility and improved satisfaction at dinnertime compared to the
oatmeal breakfast [50].
There are several limitations to this study including the use of whole foods for the intervention,
which does not allow the participants to be blinded to the specific breakfast. However, any bias over
the foods consumed was removed since no expectations of the data were shared with the participants.
Another limitation would be ghrelin measurement, which was assessed prior to consuming breakfast
only. The post-prandial assessment of ghrelin would have strengthened the results found by VAS
analysis. While appetite was affected following the consumption of eggs, there were no observed
differences in energy intake. This could be considered a limitation, because though satiety was
improved, this may not be considered an effective treatment for weight loss. There were also some
strengths to this study including the use of whole foods, as the results can be easily extrapolated to
the general population, because these foods are normally consumed for breakfast. The assessment of
satiety via VAS and the plasma measurement of ghrelin were also strengths of this study in evaluating
and correlating hunger and the desire to eat throughout the day.
The intake of two eggs per day as compared to an oatmeal breakfast promoted a shift in dietary
intake patterns, did not lead to an increase in biomarkers associated with CVD, and resulted in both
subjective and objective measures of satiety in a healthy population. The results of the study are
important to confirming eggs as a healthy habitual breakfast food with additional benefits of increased
satiety throughout the day.
