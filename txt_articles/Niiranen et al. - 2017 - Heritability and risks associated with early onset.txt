ABSTRACT
ObjeCtive
To determine the role of early onset versus late onset 
hypertension as a risk factor for hypertension in 
offspring and cardiovascular death.
Design
Multigenerational, prospective cohort study.
setting
Framingham Heart Study.
PartiCiPants
Two generations of community dwelling participants 
with blood pressure measurements performed at serial 
examinations spanning six decades: 3614 first 
generation participants with mortality data and 1635 
initially non-hypertensive second generation 
participants with data available on parental blood 
pressure.
Main OutCOMe Measures
The main outcome measures were relation of parental 
early onset hypertension (age <55 years) with 
incidence of hypertension in offspring, using 
regression analyses, and relation of age at 
hypertension onset with cause specific mortality using 
a case (cardiovascular death) versus control (non-
cardiovascular death) design.
results
In second generation participants, having one or both 
parents with late onset hypertension did not increase 
the risk of hypertension compared with having parents 
with no hypertension; by contrast, the hazard ratios of 
hypertension were 2.0 (95% confidence interval 1.2 to 
3.5) and 3.5 (1.9 to 6.1) in participants with one and both 
parents with early onset hypertension, respectively. In 
first generation decedents, 1151 cardiovascular deaths 
occurred (including 630 coronary deaths). The odds of 
cardiovascular death increased linearly with decreasing 
age of hypertension onset (P<0.001 for trend). 
Compared with non-hypertensive participants, 
hypertension onset at age <45 years conferred an odds 
ratios of 2.2 (1.8 to 2.7) for cardiovascular death and 2.3 
(1.8 to 2.9) for coronary death, whereas hypertension 
onset at age ≥65 years conferred a lower magnitude 
odds ratios of 1.5 (1.2 to 1.9) for cardiovascular death 
and 1.4 (0.98 to 1.9) for coronary death (P≤0.002 for 
differences in odds ratios between hypertension onset 
at age <45 and age ≥65).
COnClusiOns
Early onset and not late onset hypertension in parents 
was strongly associated with hypertension in offspring. 
In turn, early onset compared with late onset 
hypertension was associated with greater odds of 
cardiovascular, and particularly coronary, death. These 
findings suggest it may be important to distinguish 
between early onset and late onset hypertension as a 
familial trait when assessing an individual’s risk for 
hypertension, and as a specific type of blood pressure 
trait when estimating risk for cardiovascular outcomes 
in adults with established hypertension.
Introduction
Hypertension remains a major risk factor for cardiovas-
cular morbidity and mortality worldwide.1  Growing evi-
dence points to the potential benefit of treating 
hypertension with blood pressure goals approaching 
the normotensive range.2 3  As clinical practice shifts 
further towards the goal of maintaining an ideal blood 
pressure, there is now also increasing emphasis on pri-
mordial prevention and identifying those at risk for 
developing hypertension.4-6  Although it is well recog-
nized that the majority of “essential” (ie, primary) 
hypertension results from environmental exposures 
superimposed on an inherited predisposition, the 
extent to which genetic versus lifestyle factors and their 
interactions determine risk of hypertension remains 
unclear.7 
8  Given that hypertension is a heterogeneous 
as well as complex trait, it is conceivable that the less 
common forms of hypertension that tend to manifest 
earlier in life are more genetically determined, whereas 
the more common forms that tend to present later in life 
are more environmentally determined. This notion may 
motivate the extent to which individuals presenting 
with hypertension in the clinical setting are screened 
for inherited factors or initially treated with antihyper-
tensive drugs.9 
10
It is well known that hypertension confers substan-
tial risk for developing cardiovascular outcomes when 
present in either younger or older age. However, there 
are currently scant data to guide clinicians on 
the  
possible relevance of distinguishing between the

importance of hypertension that develops earlier in life 
and that which develops later in life. Early onset com-
pared with late onset hypertension is not only more 
likely to be a heritable risk trait but is perhaps also 
associated with greater risk for adverse outcomes, 
although the latter premise has yet to be demonstrated. 
To test these hypotheses, we conducted an investiga-
tion in the family based Framingham Heart Study to 
assess the extent to which early onset versus late onset 
hypertension represents a trait inherited from parents 
and, in turn, the long term risks associated with devel-
oping early onset versus late onset hypertension over 
the adult life course. For this study, we used objectively 
ascertained blood pressure measurements collected 
from serial examinations attended by two generations 
of Framingham participants over a span of six decades, 
along with concurrent surveillance data on disease 
outcomes.
Methods
Cohorts
The first generation (“original”) cohort of the Framing-
ham Heart Study included 5209 respondents of a ran-
dom sample of two thirds of the adult population of 
Framingham, Massachusetts, who were enrolled in a 
longitudinal community based cohort study, wherein 
they participated in biennial examinations beginning 
in 1948. The second generation (“offspring”) cohort 
includes 5124 participants of the first generation cohort 
and their spouses, who were re-examined eight years 
after the first examination in 1971 and then approxi-
mately every four years thereafter. The characteristics 
and study protocol of both cohorts have been published 
elsewhere.11 12 Each participant provided written 
informed consent.
Clinical evaluation and definitions
At each study cycle, participants in both cohorts pro-
vided a medical history, including information on med-
ication use, and underwent a physical examination and 
laboratory assessment of cardiovascular risk factors.11-13 
 
Conventional risk factors were measured at all exam-
inations in the offspring cohort whereas smoking sta-
tus, serum total cholesterol level, and blood glucose 
level were determined at 25, 19, and 22 out of 28 exam-
inations of the original cohort, respectively. At all exam-
inations, a physician performed two sequential 
measurements of blood pressure using a mercury col-
umn sphygmomanometer on the left arm of seated par-
ticipants according to a standardized protocol. We 
defined the blood pressure at a given examination as 
the mean of the two sequentially measured blood pres-
sure values from that clinical assessment. For partici-
pants in both cohorts, given the availability of blood 
pressure data collected from multiple serial examina-
tions, we defined hypertension as blood pressure 
≥140/90 mm Hg or use of antihypertensive drugs on two 
or more consecutively attended examinations. We 
selected this definition to reduce variation based on 
only one measurement and to represent a durable 
change in blood pressure. Consistent with the  
definition 
of hypertension and onset of disease reported in multi-
ple previous studies, we also defined onset of hyperten-
sion as the first examination at which criteria for 
hypertension were met.14-16
Assessment of early onset hypertension was based on 
all available blood pressure measurements performed 
at serial examinations attended by the participants in 
the original cohort from 1948 through 2005 and partici-
pants in the offspring cohort from 1971 through 2008. 
We defined early onset hypertension as being present 
(ie, binary variable) if hypertension was objectively 
ascertained in an individual who was aged <55 years at 
the time of blood pressure measurement, in accordance 
with use of this same age threshold in previous studies 
of hypertension and in the hypertension guidelines of 
the National Institute for Health and Care Excel-
lence.14 
17 
18  Although information on the use of antihy-
pertensive drugs was not available for the three initial 
examinations of participants in the original cohort 
(1948-56), we considered these participants as having 
no antihypertensive drug use given that blood pressure 
treatment thresholds during that period were high (180-
200/100-110 mm Hg) and the efficacy of available anti-
hypertensive drugs during this same period was 
limited.19
Onset of hypertension in parents and risk of 
hypertension in offspring
To study the effects of early onset versus late onset 
hypertension in parents on the risk of hypertension in 
their offspring, we focused our analysis on participants 
of the Framingham offspring cohort who had both par-
ents in the original cohort (n=2470) with directly mea-
sured blood pressure data available. From this sample 
we excluded offspring who had hypertension at base-
line (n=461), did not attend follow-up examinations 
(n=159), or had missing covariates (n=44). We also 
excluded offspring if the age of hypertension onset in 
parents could not be determined—for example, if one 
parent or both parents aged ≥55 years had hypertension 
at their baseline examination (n=130) or if one or both 
parents did not attend any follow-up examinations 
(n=41). Thus, the final sample for this analysis was 1635.
To capture a relatively specific measure of risk expo-
sure, we categorized parental hypertension status as 
having both parents free of hypertension; one or both 
parents with late onset hypertension; at least one par-
ent with early onset hypertension (including only one 
parent with early onset hypertension, or one parent 
with early onset and one parent with late onset hyper-
tension); or both parents with early onset hypertension. 
We compared baseline characteristics between the off-
spring groups using one way analysis of variance for 
continuous variables and χ2 tests for categorical vari-
ables. We calculated hypertension incidence rates per 
1000 person years and estimated 95% confidence inter-
vals using a Poisson distribution. We compared the 
cumulative incidence curves of hypertension between 
groups using Kaplan-Meier analysis and the log-rank 
test. Because dates of hypertension onset were grouped, 
we defined the date of hypertension onset in offspring

participants as the median date of each examination 
cycle, and we used a discrete time logistic model to 
assess the association between parental age of hyper-
tension onset and risk of hypertension in offspring par-
ticipants. We adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, 
smoking status, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood 
pressure, total cholesterol level, and high density lipo-
protein cholesterol level. We did not include diabetes 
status as a covariate in the main models given its 
extremely low prevalence at baseline: 5 of 1635 partici-
pants (0.3%). We assessed the heterogeneity of the 
effect of parental hypertension status between men and 
women using a multiplicative interaction term. We esti-
mated robust standard errors using a sandwich covari-
ance matrix that incorporates estimates of correlation 
between offspring.20  Given the long duration of fol-
low-up, we investigated how younger compared with 
older age at risk in offspring participants (ie, age during 
follow-up or, alternatively, attained age) might influ-
ence the association between parental hypertension 
status and incident hypertension in offspring partici-
pants. Specifically, we repeated analyses using off-
spring cohort follow-up data, divided into two age at 
risk bands (<55 and ≥55 years). We then estimated age 
at risk specific hazard ratios by incorporating an inter-
action term between age at risk and parental hyperten-
sion status in models with adjustment for the same 
previously mentioned covariates except for age, which 
was replaced by year of birth.21 In secondary analyses, 
we examined the extent to which age of parents at 
hypertension onset was associated with onset age in 
offspring, in those offspring participants who devel-
oped hypertension (n=463) and had one hypertensive 
parent or two. For these analyses, we used multivari-
able adjusted regression models fit with generalized 
estimating equations (to account for inter-sibling cor-
relations) and defined parental age at onset of hyper-
tension as the lower of the two available ages if both 
parents developed hypertension. We also performed a 
sensitivity analysis, with early onset hypertension 
defined as onset age <45 years, instead of <55 years, 
after excluding those with at least one parent aged ≥45 
years with hypertension at their baseline examination.
age of hypertension onset and cause specific 
mortality
Because the date of hypertension onset was not avail-
able at baseline, we investigated the relation between 
age of hypertension onset (categorized into five age 
groups) and cause specific mortality in the original 
cohort using a case-control design. We focused on the 
original cohort for this analysis, given the extended 
duration of follow-up and the relative scarcity of poten-
tially important confounders (ie, use of antihyperten-
sive drugs) during the first 40 years of surveillance for 
this cohort. From the 5209 first generation participants, 
we excluded those who had not died before 31 Decem-
ber 2013 (n=100), did not attend any follow-up exam-
inations (n=134), had died at age <45 years (n=23), had 
missing covariates (n=154), or had an age at 
 
hypertension onset that could not be determined 
(eg, participant was hypertensive at baseline and aged 
≥45 years, n=1184). Thus, the final sample was 3614 for 
this analysis.
We used a validated cause specific mortality end-
point for outcomes analyses,22 
23  which allowed for the 
exposure variable to consistently precede the outcome 
variable in timing. Given the extended follow-up dura-
tion of the original cohort, with few participants still 
alive by the last follow-up date, a cause specific mortal-
ity approach allowed for almost all individuals to con-
tribute to the outcomes analysis as either a case (ie, 
death due to cardiovascular disease) or control (ie, 
death not due to cardiovascular disease). We catego-
rized decedents into five categories based on their age at 
hypertension onset, with those who died without ever 
developing hypertension serving as the referent group. 
In case-control comparisons, we related the age at 
hypertension onset to cause specific death: cases were 
considered those who died from cardiovascular disease 
(n=1151) or those who died specifically from coronary 
heart disease (n=630), and controls included the 
remaining 2463 decedents. Owing to the relatively low 
number of participants who had died specifically from 
stroke (n=221), we examined stroke deaths separately in 
a supplementary analysis. Criteria for adjudication of 
cardiovascular, coronary, and stroke deaths have been 
described previously.24 We used logistic regression to 
calculate odds ratios for cases versus controls, adjusted 
for age at death, sex, smoking status, total cholesterol 
level, and diabetes (defined as non-fasting plasma glu-
cose level ≥11.1 mmol/L or treatment with antidiabetic 
drugs). We drew the modifiable covariates (smoking, 
cholesterol, and diabetes) from first examination cycle 
at which data were available. We assessed model good-
ness-of-fit using the Akaike information criterion. We 
also performed sensitivity analyses with modifiable 
covariates drawn from the examination at which the 
age of the decedent was closest to the mean age of 
hypertension onset in the sample (55.8 years) where 
data were available. We tested for a linear trend in odds 
ratios across categories of age at hypertension onset.
All analyses were performed with SAS software ver-
sion 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). We considered a two 
sided P<0.05 to be statistically significant.
Patient involvement
No participants were involved in developing research 
questions or outcome measures, nor were they involved 
in developing plans for design, recruitment, or imple-
mentation of the study. No participants were asked to 
advise on data interpretation or drafting of the manu-
script. Research findings from the Framingham Heart 
Study are reported on the study website (www.framing-
hamheartstudy.org/) and disseminated to participants 
as part of mailed newsletters annually.

more noticeably, in terms of systolic and diastolic blood 
pressure.
Hypertension onset age in parents and 
hypertension risk in offspring
Over a mean follow-up of 26 (SD 9) years, 481 of 1635 
offspring participants (29.4%) developed hypertension. 
A progressive increase in hypertension was seen across 
all categories during follow-up. This increase was the 
greatest in those whose parents both had early onset 
hypertension and the lowest in those with 
 
non-hypertensive parents (fig 1 , log-rank P<0.001). The 
incidence of hypertension was nearly three times greater 
in those with parents who both had early onset 
 
hypertension than in those with non-hypertensive par-
ents (table 2). In the subgroup of 1488 offspring partici-
pants who were aged <45 years at baseline, the age 
specific incidence of hypertension at 45, 55, 65, and 75 
years increased across the four groups according to 
parental hypertension status (see supplementary 
 
figure 1).
In unadjusted analyses, we observed that having a 
parent with late onset hypertension did not signifi-
cantly increase the risk of hypertension compared with 
having normotensive parents; by contrast (table 2), hav-
ing one parent with early onset hypertension was 
related to a hazard ratio of 1.93 (95% confidence interval 
1.13 to 3.29; P=0.02) for hypertension. Having two par-
ents with early onset hypertension was associated with 
a hazard ratio of 3.56 (2.06 to 6.16; P<0.001) for hyper-
tension. Adjustment for covariates did not materially 
alter these results. We investigated how age at risk 
affects the association between incident hypertension 
and parental hypertension status by dividing the fol-
low-up into two age at risk bands (<55 and ≥55 years). 
Parental hypertension status carried a similar risk for 
incident hypertension in both age at risk bands (see 
supplementary table 1). We observed no heterogeneity 
of the effect of parental hypertension status between 
men and women when we added a sex interaction term 
in the adjusted models (P=0.68).
After excluding participants with at least one parent 
aged ≥45 years with hypertension at their baseline 
examination, we performed a sensitivity analysis in

1297 offspring participants with early onset 
 
hypertension, defined as onset age <45 years instead of 
<55 years (see supplementary table 2); the results of 
these analyses were similar to those of the main models 
(table 2). In secondary analyses examining the relation 
of age at onset of hypertension between parents and off-
spring, a 10 year lower onset age in parents was associ-
ated with a 0.71 year (95% confidence interval 0.13 to 
1.28; P=0.02) lower onset age in offspring.
Hypertension onset age and risk for cardiovascular 
death
Table 3  shows the characteristics of the deceased par-
ticipants in the original cohort by case-control status. 
Certain demographic and clinical characteristics were 
expectedly more prominent among those who had died 
of cardiovascular causes versus non-cardiovascular 
causes. Of note, participants who had died of 
 
cardiovascular and coronary heart disease had experi-
enced hypertension onset at a younger age than those 
who died of non-cardiovascular causes. Figure 2 and 
supplementary figure 2 display the main results of ana-
lyzing risk of cardiovascular versus non-cardiovascular 
deaths by age group of hypertension onset. The trends 
of decreasing age of hypertension onset in relation to 
increasing odds of cardiovascular and coronary 
 
mortality were significant in both unadjusted and 
adjusted analyses (P<0.001 for all).
Compared with participants without hypertension, 
hypertension onset before age 45 was associated with 
an odds ratio of 2.19 (95% confidence interval 1.77 to 
2.70; P<0.001) of cardiovascular death; by contrast, 
hypertension onset at age ≥65 years was associated 
with only an odds ratio of 1.47 (1.16 to 1.87; P=0.001) for 
cardiovascular death (fig 2 ). Similarly, hypertension 
onset before age 45 was related to an odds ratio of 2.26 
(1.75 to 2.93; P<0.001) for coronary death and hyperten-
sion onset at age ≥65 years did not confer a significantly 
greater odds of coronary death (odds ratio 1.36, 95% 
confidence interval 0.98 to 1.87; P=0.07; see supplemen-
tary figure 2). Furthermore, the odds of cardiovascular 
death (1.48, 1.16 to 1.89; P=0.002) and coronary death 
(1.67
, 1.21 to 2.31; P=0.002) were significantly higher in 
participants with hypertension onset before age 45 than 
in those with onset at age ≥65 years (fig 2 ). We observed 
a trend in increasing odds of stroke death with decreas-
ing age of hypertension onset (P<0.001 for trend, see 
supplementary table 3); this trend was significant albeit 
less evident than the trends observed for cardiovascular 
death and coronary death, given the relatively lower 
number of stroke deaths. In the model for cardiovascu-
lar death (fig 2), we observed improvement in model 
goodness of fit, compared with the unadjusted model 
(Akaike information criterion (AIC) 4447), after adding 
sex and age at death as covariates (AIC=4361). We 
observed a more modest further improvement in model 
fit after additionally including the other clinical covari-
ates (AIC=4322). In additional analyses that included 
weight as a covariate in the models, results were not 
substantially changed (data not shown). In sensitivity 
analyses including covariates drawn from the examina-
tion at which the decedent age was closest to the mean 
age of hypertension onset of the sample, results were 
similar (see supplementary figure 3, P<0.001 for trend).
discussion
The availability of serial, standardized blood pressure 
measurements performed in the family based Framing-
ham Heart Study provided the unique opportunity to 
investigate the risks associated with early onset hyper-
tension compared with late onset hypertension in the 
community. We observed that early and not late onset 
hypertension in parents predicted incident hyperten-
sion in offspring. In turn, the presence of early onset 
compared with late onset hypertension was associated 
with a greater risk for cardiovascular death. These find-
ings suggest it may be important to distinguish between 
early onset and late onset hypertension as a familial

trait when assessing an individual’s risk for 
 
hypertension and as a specific type of blood pressure 
trait when estimating risk for cardiovascular outcomes 
in individuals with established hypertension.
strengths and limitations of this study
Our study has several strengths, including the large com-
munity based sample with objective blood pressure mea-
surements and longitudinal data collected across family 
members. In addition, we examined for incident hyper-
tension in the original cohort over a period of 60 years; 
this cohort had a high retention rate and less than 1.9% 
of the participants (100 of 5209 participants) were alive at 
the end of follow-up. Thus, our analyses included near 
complete data for both early onset and late onset hyper-
tension in the parental cohort. Because antihypertensive 
drug use was relatively uncommon and had limited effi-
cacy during the first four decades of assessments in the 
original cohort,19  results of our outcomes analyses are 
relatively unconfounded by antihypertensive drug use; 
thus, potential implications of the outcomes results may 
be particularly relevant for the large proportion of indi-
viduals with hypertension who remain untreated or 
undertreated worldwide.25  However, several limitations 
of our study also merit consideration. We observed a 
trend in increasing odds of stroke death with decreasing 
age of hypertension onset, although this analysis was 
limited by the smaller fraction of total cardiovascular 
deaths being attributable to stroke in our study. Thus, the 
observed point estimates from this analysis were less sta-
ble with wider confidence intervals, reflecting limited 
power and providing suggestive albeit less than defini-
tive results on the relation of age at hypertension onset 
with stroke death. The follow-up intervals in the original 
and offspring cohorts of the Framingham Heart Study 
differed as parents underwent biennial examinations 
whereas their offspring were re-examined eight years 
after the first examination and every four years thereaf-
ter. However, because the cohorts were not pooled for 
analyses, this discrepancy in time intervals between 
examinations most likely did not substantially influence 
the main results. For some individuals, hypertension 
may arise secondary to a specific neurohormonal, renal, 
or other medical condition that not only warrants spe-
cific  
treatment but also confers additional adverse risk. 
In our study, possible secondary causes of hypertension 
were not routinely assessed as part of the standardized 
examination. Although the prevalence of secondary 
hypertension is reportedly less than 1% in the commu-
nity,26  it is more likely to be present in earlier rather than 
later life and so additional studies are needed to examine 
whether the presence of secondary versus primary 
hypertension partly accounts for or impacts the associa-
tion of age at hypertension onset with outcomes. Precise 
data on physical activity and dietary patterns were not 
available for the offspring cohort. None the less, these 
factors are highly correlated with body mass index, 
which was included in all models, and body mass index 
likely mediates their effect on blood pressure.27 Our study 
sample included predominantly white adults of Euro-
pean ancestry and thus the generalizability of our results 
to other racial or ethnic groups remains unknown. 
Because the outcomes analyses were based on a 
case-control design, additional studies in prospective as 
well as more diverse populations are needed to validate 
our main findings.
Comparison with other studies
With an increasing clinical focus on maintaining blood 
pressure values within the normotensive range,2 28 29 
 
there is ever growing interest in identifying those at risk 
for developing hypertension who may benefit from 
early interventions.4-6  Because hypertension is known 
to result from environmental exposures acting on top of 
an inherited predisposition, numerous studies have 
sought to characterize its genetic determinants. Inter-
estingly, genetic risk scores have not been shown to 
appreciably add to familial history when predicting 
incident hypertension.30  This phenomenon is likely due 
to the fact that family history captures information on 
shared lifestyle and dietary patterns31  as well as the 
general tendency for multiple cardiovascular risk fac-
tors to cluster within families. Therefore, we examined 
the extent to which early onset versus late onset hyper-
tension in parents predicts incident hypertension in 
offspring to leverage the information offered by family 
history while also refining its potential to improve risk 
assessment. Our results suggest that a precisely defined 
family history of early onset hypertension is both a 
robust and a widely accessible tool for predicting inci-
dent hypertension. Although previous studies have 
shown that any hypertension in parents increases the 
risk of incident hypertension by 1.3-fold to 2.0-fold in 
children30 32 33  and adults,34-37  previous investigations 
have all relied on participants’ self report for determin-
ing parental history of hypertension and thus have been 
limited by reporting bias and potentially inaccurate 
estimates of risk.38  Interestingly, the risk estimates 
reported in most published studies are lower than the 
estimates we observed for objectively assessed early 
onset hypertension in Framingham. This discrepancy 
suggests that a portion of the risk conveyed by parental 
hypertension may have been previously missed owing 
to lack of precision in capturing parental history of 
hypertension, or owing to attenuation of effects 
observed when not distinguishing between early onset 
versus late onset hypertension as a potentially heritable 
trait. To our knowledge, only two previous studies have 
attempted to assess the relative impact of parental early 
onset versus late onset hypertension on risk for hyper-
tension in offspring, with conflicting results.14 18  Hunt 
and colleagues examined participant reported hyper-
tension in relation to a reported family history of hyper-
tension; in the absence of available data on blood 
pressure measurement for either parents or offspring, 
analyses relied on a reported age of hypertension diag-
nosis in parents instead of any objectively assessed age 
at onset of hypertension. In these analyses, familial 
early onset and late onset hypertension were similarly 
associated with risk of hypertension in offspring.18

this trait with offspring blood pressure that was self 
measured using a mercury sphygmomanometer by 
study participants who were all male physicians.14 
Although the study was based on a selected study sam-
ple of health professionals trained at Johns Hopkins, of 
whom only 18 participants had two parents with 
reported early onset hypertension, the researchers 
observed a greater risk of hypertension among male 
physicians whose parents had early onset compared 
with late onset hypertension. The present study extends 
from previous work not only by investigating the age at 
actual hypertension onset but also by examining its 
association with cardiovascular risk.
Because hypertension is known to confer substantial 
risk for a variety of cardiovascular as well as non-cardio-
vascular diseases, concerted efforts have been devoted to 
developing more accurate assessments of hypertension 
related risk among vulnerable individuals. Accordingly, 
several studies have shown that distinct blood pressure 
trajectory patterns and antecedent time averaged or 
cumulative blood pressure (mm Hg×year) may be more 
effective than a single visit blood pressure measure in 
predicting target organ damage and adverse events.39-43 
 
While confirming the importance of capturing exposure 
during the life course, these approaches have limited 
utility in clinical practice, wherein longitudinal data col-
lected from standardized repeated blood pressure mea-
sures are not typically available. Our study findings 
suggest that age at hypertension onset is an easily ascer-
tained trait that not only reflects an inherited predisposi-
tion for raised blood pressure but also offers important 
prognostic information in assessing an individual’s car-
diovascular risk. Multiple previous studies have shown 
that hypertension confers cardiovascular risk whether 
present in younger age or older age, but prognostic data 
related to hypertension that manifests earlier in life ver-
sus later have been extremely limited. We found a single 
study of hypertensive primary care patients and normo-
tensive controls,44 published in 1987
, which reported that 
the patients who received a hypertension diagnosis 
during their fifth decade of life had a 5.2-fold odds of 
developing a cardiovascular event compared with 
non-hypertensive patients; by contrast, patients who 
received a diagnosis of hypertension during their seventh 
decade of life had a corresponding odds ratio of only 1.2. 
No confidence intervals for the odds ratios were reported. 
The odds ratios were also unadjusted for age at death 
and other conventional cardiovascular risk factors, and 
may therefore only reflect the rising impact of other dis-
ease events, such as cancer, with age. None the less, our 
results are concordant with these historical findings, 
while based on analyzing objectively measured blood 
pressure data and more precise estimates of age at hyper-
tension onset, in both parents and offspring.
Conclusions and policy implications
Our results show that early, and not late, onset hyper-
tension in parents is a strong risk factor for incident 
hypertension in offspring as well as for cardiovascular 
death in those with hypertension. Whereas current 
practice involves only collecting data on family history 
on the presence or absence of hypertension in parents, 
our findings suggest the added value of determining age 
at onset in affected parents. Given their observed 
increased risk for hypertension, those whose parents 
had early onset hypertension would likely benefit from 
blood pressure monitoring at regular intervals and life-
style counseling. For individuals with already manifest 
early onset hypertension, our findings indicate a risk for 
cardiovascular events even greater than in those with 
late onset hypertension. Several studies have reported 
that some younger individuals with early onset hyper-
tension may be less likely than older individuals to 
receive aggressive blood pressure management in prac-
tice,25 45 46 and our results underscore the need for 
appropriate care in these at risk individuals and poten-
tially more targeted antihypertensive treatment. Further 
research is warranted to determine if age at hyperten-
sion onset could be used to estimate cardiovascular risk 
with greater precision and guide treatment. Additional 
work is also needed to evaluate the extent to which spe-
cific interventions may be warranted for preventing or 
managing early onset versus late onset hypertension.
