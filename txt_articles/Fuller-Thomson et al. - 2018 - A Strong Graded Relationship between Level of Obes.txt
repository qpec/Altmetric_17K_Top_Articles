Factors associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) among never-smokers have received little research
attention. One potential risk factor for COPD is obesity, which is of particular importance in light of the global obesity epidemic.
Te objective of this study was to investigate the association between COPD and levels of obesity in a nationally representative
sample of non-Hispanic white never-smokers. Data were drawn from the 2012 Center for Disease Control’s Behavioral Risk Factor
Surveillance System (BRFSS). Pearson’s chi-square tests and logistic regression analyses were conducted in a large nationally
representative sample of non-Hispanic white respondents aged 50 and over (76,004 women; 37,618 men) who reported that they
had never smoked. A dose-response relationship was observed for both men and women: the prevalence of COPD increased from
2.5% in men and 3.5% in women who were of a healthy weight (BMI < 25) to 7.6% in men and 13.4% in women who had a BMI of
40 or higher. Even after adjusting for 7 potential confounds (e.g., age, education, and income), the odds of COPD were 3.21 higher
for men (95% CI � 2.46, 4.20) and 4.00 higher for women with class III obesity (95% CI � 3.52, 4.55) in comparison with those of
healthy weight. Regular screening for COPD is warranted in never-smoking obese patients who are aged 50 and over. Future
research is needed to investigate plausible mechanisms for this association, including (1) the role of chronic inflammation
associated with obesity and (2) the impact of central obesity on respiratory system mechanics.
1. Introduction
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major
public health issue. Fifteen million Americans are diagnosed
with COPD [
1]with estimates varying in each state from 4%
to 9% of the population [
2]
. Approximately 135,000
Americans die from COPD each year, making it the third
leading cause of death in the United States [
2]
. In recent
years, mortality rates due to COPD have shown a significant
increase, particularly among women [
3]
. COPD is one of the
major causes of disability [
4]
, impacting individuals’ ability
to work, sleep, and participate in household chores and
family activities [
2]
. In 2010, 50 billion dollars annually was
spent on COPD, approximately 60% of which was due to
direct health expenditures [
2]
. Te remaining 40% of the
costs were due to lost productivity because of illness and

 premature mortality [
2]
. Although smoking is the best-
known risk factor for COPD, 23% of those with the con-
dition have never smoked [
5]
.
New research suggests that the association between
obesity and COPD warrants greater research attention [
6]
.
Obesity in adults is defined as having a body mass index
(BMI) of 30 or higher [
7]
. Te World Health Organization
further divides obesity into class I (BMI 30–34.99), class II
(BMI 35–39.99), and class III (BMI of 40 or higher) [
8]
.
Individuals that fall into the class III category tend to be
100–200 pounds (45–90 kg) overweight [
9]
. One in every 16
Americans (6.2%) has class III obesity [
10]
. From 2000 to
2005, the prevalence of a BMI over 40 increased by 50% [
11]
.
Tis rapid increase is particularly concerning to the
healthcare system because individuals with class III obesity
encounter more serious health problems than those with
moderate obesity and have much higher annual healthcare
costs [
11]
.
Obesity is a major health risk that is linked to several life-
threatening diseases, including stroke, type 2 diabetes, hy-
pertension, coronary artery disease, and a number of dif-
ferent cancers [
12]
. Te United States has one of the highest
rates of obesity in the world, with more than one-third of US
adults classified as obese [
13]
. Tis growing phenomenon is
concerning, with obesity now ranking as the seventh leading
cause of death in the United States [
14]
, with approximately
300,000 deaths directly linked to obesity each year [
15]
.
Furthermore, people with obesity have medical costs 30%
higher than those of a healthy weight [
16]
. In 2008, obesity-
related medical costs had risen to $75 billion dollars, with
projections suggesting they will comprise 16–18% of the
total US healthcare expenditure by 2030 [
16]
.
Cross-sectional studies have demonstrated an inverse
association between obesity and the prevalence of COPD
[6]. Many of these studies included both never-smoking
and ever-smoking samples, were not sex specific, and
failed to adjust statistically for other known risks for
COPD. Te direction of the association is unclear. It is
possible that improper lung function increases the risk of
developing obesity. Tis may be due to the following three
causes: (1) COPD patients’ difficulty breathing while ex-
ercising often results in lower levels of physical activity and
thus fewer calories burned in exercise, (2) a common side
effect of long-term glucocorticosteroid medications is
weight gain [6], and (3) due to being hypoxemic both at
rest and with exercise, COPD patients are unable to utilize
oxygen for the breakdown of fatty acids through beta
oxidation. Without this pathway, their bodies are unable to
properly utilize fat as an energy source during bouts of
aerobic exercise and their cells are forced to utilize less
efficient means of energy production via anaerobic
pathways [
17]. However, a recent prospective study of
almost 50,000 American Association of Retired Persons
(AARP) aged 50 to 70 who had never smoked provides
important support for the hypothesis that obesity puts
individuals at a greater risk for COPD [
18]. In their
analysis, never-smoking adults with a BMI of 35 or more
without COPD, cancer, or heart disease in 1995 had 36%
higher odds of developing COPD by 2006, and that
relationship
remained
after
adjusting
for
socio-
demographics, height, diabetes, and alcohol intake at
baseline [
18].
Although the association between obesity and COPD is
increasingly recognized, the mechanisms involved and the
nature of the relationship are still unclear. One reason for
this uncertainty is that studies looking at COPD typically
have included current smokers or those with a history of
smoking (e.g., [
19]
). Since smoking is the number one risk
factor for the development of COPD [
20]
, including smokers
in the studies makes it more difficult to investigate whether
obesity is playing an independent role in the development of
COPD, aside from the smoking, and whether obesity is
associated with a dose-response relationship.
Te purpose of this paper is to determine if there is an
association between obesity level and prevalence of COPD.
Since there are marked sex and race differences in vulner-
ability to COPD among never-smokers, and there is an
interaction between sex and race [
21]
, it is important to
conduct sex specific analyses and to focus on one particular
race [
22]
. For the purposes of this study, we have focused on
the largest single racial group, non-Hispanic white in-
dividuals. Te data set we used, the Behavioral Risk Factor
Surveillance System (BRFSS), did not contain information
on immigration status. In the developing world, indoor use
of biomass fuels such as charcoal and wood for cooking is
a major cause of COPD among never-smokers [
23]
. To
minimize the likelihood of this confound, we chose to in-
clude only non-Hispanic whites in this study, because the
majority of non-Hispanic white immigrants came from
countries in Europe, as well as Australia and Canada, where
use of biomass for cooking and heating is unusual. Socio-
economic status (SES), measured by both education and
income levels, is inversely associated with both obesity [
24]
and elevated levels of COPD [
25] and thus must be taken
into account. A review of literature on the effect of socio-
economic status on COPD suggests that the association
between the two is multifactorial in nature with housing
conditions, exposure to toxins during prenatal and child-
hood, diet, and lifestyle choices contributing to the asso-
ciation [
25]
.
2. Methods
2.1. Data Source and Sample. As described elsewhere [
26]
,
the data were derived from the CDC’s 2012 BRFSS [
27]
,
a nationally representative telephone survey of the health and
health behaviors of noninstitutionalized adults. Due to the
long latency of COPD, the sample was restricted to re-
spondents aged 50 and older who had never smoked. Current
or former smokers were excluded in order to investigate the
association between obesity and COPD without confounding
by smoking, the largest known risk factor for the disease. As
was discussed above, the sample was restricted to non-
Hispanic white respondents because we did not have in-
formation in the BRFSS on immigration status and we wanted
to minimize the probability that respondents had been im-
migrants from the developing world where indoor cooking
with charcoal or wood contributes substantially to the
2
Journal of Obesity
 incidence of COPD among never-smokers [
23]
. To minimize
the likelihood of this confound, we chose to include only non-
Hispanic whites in this study because the majority of these
immigrants would come from countries in Europe, as well as
Australia and Canada, where use of biomass for cooking is
unusual. Te final unweighted sample included 76,004
women and 37,618 men, of whom 2,895 women and 1,069
men had class III obesity and 4,048 women and 1,153 men
had COPD.
2.2. Measures
2.2.1. Outcome. COPD was dichotomized based on par-
ticipants’ response to a question if they had been told by
a doctor, nurse, or other health professionals that they had
“chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or COPD, em-
physema, or chronic bronchitis?”
2.2.2. Exposure of Interest. Obesity: Self-reported weight in
kilograms (kg) was divided by self-reported height in
squared metres (m2) to define BMI, which was then cate-
gorized into ranges defining normal weight (BMI <
25 kg/m2), overweight (BMI � 25–29.99 kg/m2), obese class 1
and 2 (BMI � 30 kg/m2 to 39.99), and class III obesity (BMI �
40 or higher).
2.2.3. Control Variables. Several control characteristics were
assessed, including sex, age (categorized by decade: 50s, 60s,
70s, and 80+), and self-reported height in inches. Education
was assessed based on the following categories: did not
graduate high school, graduated high school, attended college
or technical school, and graduated from college or technical
school. Household income was categorized as less than $15,000,
$15,000–$24,999, $25,000–$ 49,999, $50,000–$74,999, $75,000
or above, and a missing category.
Second-hand smoke exposure is also a substantial risk
factor for COPD among never-smokers, with an estimated
9% of cases due to exposure to second-hand smoke at home
[
28]
. Although we did not have a direct measure of such
exposure, we assumed never married respondents and those
who lived alone would be the least likely to have been ex-
posed to second-hand smoke at home. Marital status was
dichotomized as having ever been married or currently
living common-law versus never married. Te number of
individuals in the household was categorized as one, two,
three or more, and missing.
Since we relied upon self-report of a medical diagnosis of
COPD, we were concerned that those without health cov-
erage may be less likely to have been assessed for COPD. To
address this potential bias, we included healthcare coverage
based upon the question “Do you have any kind of
healthcare coverage, including health insurance, prepaid
plans such as HMOs, or government plans such as Medicare,
or Indian Health Service?”
2.3. Statistical Analyses. Bivariate analyses using Pearson’s
chi-square tests were conducted to assess the prevalence of
COPD by obesity and each of the control variables. Of
particular interest was the degree to which potential con-
founds might attenuate the relationship between obesity and
COPD. To determine if we needed sex specific analyses, we
conducted a logistic regression analysis testing for in-
teraction effects between sex and obesity level (analyses not
shown). Te interaction effect was statistically significant
(p < 0.001). Tus, logistic regression analyses were con-
ducted separately for men and women, with obesity level as
the focal exposure and COPD as the outcome variable. In the
first logistic regression, only obesity level was in the model.
In the second logistic regression, all of the control variables
were added to the analysis. Data were weighted to correct for
nonresponse and likelihood of selection.
3. Results
Among non-Hispanic white women aged 50 and over who
were lifelong nonsmokers, the prevalence of COPD in-
creased in a graded fashion from 3.5% in women who were
of normal weight (BMI < 25) to 13.4% in women who had
class III obesity (BMI of 40 or higher; p < 0.001) (Table 1).
Even after adjusting for all 7 potential confounds, the odds of
COPD among women were 25% higher for those in the
overweight category (95% CI � 1.15, 1.37), twice as high for
those in class I or II obesity (OR � 2,12; 95% CI � 1.94, 2.31),
and four times higher (95% CI � 3.52, 4.55) for women who
had class III obesity in comparison with those with normal
weight (Table 2).
Among men, the prevalence of COPD was similar for
those in the normal weight and overweight category (2.5%
and 2.2%, respectively), but was substantially higher in those
with class I and II obesity (3.8%) as well as those with class III
obesity (7.6%) (p < 0.001) (Table 3). As is shown in Table 4,
after adjustments for 7 potential confounds, the odds of
COPD among men were 71% higher for men with class I or
II obesity (OR=1.71; 95% CI=1.43, 2.04) and 3-fold higher
for men with class III obesity (OR � 3.21; 95% CI � 2.46,
4.20) in comparison with men who were normal weight.
Men in the overweight but not obese category (i.e., BMI >
24.99 and BMI < 30) did not differ from those in the normal
weight category in the logistic regression analyses.
Among both women and men, the odds of COPD were
higher among older respondents and those with lower in-
come. Among women, but not men, height and education
level were negatively associated with COPD, and being
married was associated with higher odds of COPD. Among
men, but not women, being without a health plan was as-
sociated with lower odds of reporting a COPD diagnosis.
Te number of current housemates were not associated with
COPD among men or women.
4. Discussion
Tere was a strong, graded relationship between COPD and
obesity level for both men and women, and this re-
lationship was not explained by many of the known risk
factors for COPD such as age, income, and education. Te
prevalence of COPD among never-smoking non-Hispanic
Journal of Obesity

 white Americans aged 50 and over with class III obesity is
very high with one in every 7 never-smoking women with
class III obesity and one in every 13 men with class III
obesity reporting that they have been diagnosed with
COPD.
We had anticipated that controlling for SES would
substantially attenuate the association between obesity and
COPD, due to the fact that SES is strongly associated with
both factors [
29, 30]
. Previous research indicates that in-
dividuals with a lower income have a significantly higher
prevalence of exposure to second-hand smoke and air
pollution than the rest of the population [
31, 32]
. Between
2011 and 2012, 25.3% of the total population was exposed to
second-hand smoke while the rates increase to 43.2% for
people living below the poverty level [
32]
. A study con-
trolling for smoking history concluded that approximately 1
in 11 COPD cases are caused by exposure to second-hand
smoke at home, and 1 in 15 are the result of exposure to
second-hand smoke in the workplace [
28]
. Although we
found a steep inverse gradient between income level and
COPD, adjusting for income and all the other control
variables only resulted in an extremely modest change for
either women or men in the odds ratios associated with
COPD among those with class III obesity in comparison
with those with BMI <25.
A higher percentage of women are exposed to second-
hand smoke and air pollution given they are more likely to
live below the poverty line in comparison with men [
31]and,
given the historically higher prevalence of smoking among
men, married nonsmoking women are more likely to have
been exposed to second-hand smoke than married non-
smoking men. Our finding are in keeping with this, as we

 found that marital status was significantly associated with
COPD for women in our study, but not for men.
Tere are three plausible explanations for the strong
dose-response association we found between obesity level
and COPD in both men and women: (1) obesity causes chest
wall compression and impairs diaphragm movement; (2)
inflammation associated with obesity causes or exacerbates
COPD; and (3) the symptoms of COPD result in decreased
mobility and energy expenditure that concomitantly in-
creases BMI. Obesity, particularly central obesity, has been
linked to many respiratory problems, including COPD [
33]
.
Deleterious changes in lung function due to excess weight
are not limited to those with class III obesity as they can
occur even in overweight individuals [
33]
. Obesity results in
greater demand on the lungs because the larger body mass
consumes more oxygen and obesity impairs exercise ca-
pacity, often leading to more sedentary lives [
34]
. Fat build-
up localized to areas such as the anterior chest wall, anterior
abdominal wall, and visceral organs can lead to decreased
diaphragm mobility and lowered chest wall compliance,
which then increases the effort needed to breathe [
33, 35]
.
Inflammation may also play a role in the obesity-COPD
association. Obese individuals have elevated levels of a va-
riety of inflammatory markers, including TNF-a, IL-6, and
adipose resident macrophages, which results in an increased
level of inflammation both locally and systemically [
36]
.
Inflammation may be connected to developing or exacer-
bating COPD due to the role it can play in impairing lung
function. Increased inflammation can lead to airway
remodeling, including progressive narrowing of the small
airways due to fibrosis, increased mucus production due to
more goblet cells, and alveolar wall destruction [
37]
. Tis
reaction is typically due to a maladaptive response from the
body to environmental stimuli, particularly those associated
with cigarette smoking [
38]
. However, increased activation
and function of these inflammatory cells can still be observed
in those who have never smoked [
39]
. Te reason for this
phenomenon could be due to the equally important role that

 systemic inflammation plays in the development of this
disease. Patients with COPD also have higher levels of
proinflammatory cytokines in circulation, and studies such
as the Framingham Heart Study have found that the level of
systemic inflammatory biomarkers is correlated with im-
paired lung function and the development of COPD [
38]
.
Te
Framingham
study
examined
the
systemic
in-
flammatory markers in individuals who smoked, but it is
plausible that the adipose-induced inflammation in never-
smokers with class III obesity may be causing the same effect
[
40]
.
Te previous two hypotheses suggest that obesity may
cause or exacerbate COPD. Due to the cross-sectional nature
of the current study, we cannot determine the direction of
the association. An alternate hypothesis, suggesting reverse-
causality, is that the symptoms of COPD may impede
mobility to the point of decreasing energy expenditure
which, if food consumption remains constant, could result
in increasing weight. If that is the case, then one would
expect patients with the most severe COPD symptoms
would have the most limited mobility and thus be the
heaviest. However, the opposite is true. Approximately half
of those with severe COPD experience weight loss in
comparison with one in every seven or ten patients with
mild-to-moderate COPD [
41]
.
It would be interesting for future research to explore if
alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency plays any role in the
link between obesity and COPD among those who do not
smoke. AAT is a protein that is sensitive to inflammation
[
42]
. It protects the lung tissue from neutrophil elastase,
stopping it from breaking down elastin [
43]
. A large cross-
sectional study in the general population found that BMI
was inversely associated with levels of alpha-1 antitrypsin
[
44]
. AAT deficiency is an inherited disorder that puts

 individuals at considerable risk for deterioration in lung
function and COPD in those with and without a history of
smoking [
45]
.
Tere are limitations to this study that must be con-
sidered when interpreting results. One major concern is
that the identification of those with COPD was based
upon self-report of a medical diagnosis of COPD. Pre-
vious research has indicated that there is substantial
agreement between those who report they have a medical
diagnosis of COPD and chart review, ranging from 86%
[46] to 97% concordance [47]. However, many of those
who report they do not have a medical diagnosis actually
do have the disease, but have not been tested and are
therefore unaware they have COPD. Tis error is par-
ticularly common for those with mild symptoms [48]. In
support of this hypothesis, we found that men without
health insurance, who we surmise may have less regular
access to healthcare and thus fewer opportunities of being
diagnosed than those with insurance, had 28% lower odds
of COPD. Tere was no association for women. However,
adjusting for health plan coverage did not substantially
attenuate the direct association between obesity and
COPD in either women or men. If underreporting of
COPD did occur at random, this would result in a bias
toward the null, making our results more conservative.
Without the benefit of chart review, we do not know if the
respondents were diagnosed only based upon a low FEV1
level measured in a physician’s office or on a full work-up
of many pulmonary function tests (PFT) in a hospital or
laboratory setting. Te latter is the gold standard for
COPD diagnosis. Some people with obesity who are di-
agnosed with COPD only based upon lower FEV1 levels
may in fact not have an obstructive disease but instead
have a restrictive respiratory pattern due to excess fat in
the abdomen and chest constraining expiration volume
[49]. In future research, it would be beneficial to have all
patients diagnosed through a complete battery of pul-
monary function tests.

 We also relied upon self-report of weight and height to
calculate BMI level. Research indicates self-reported in-
formation tends to underestimate obesity compared to ac-
tual measurements, particularly among women and heavier
respondents [
50]
, although such an underreporting would
bias our findings toward the null. We are missing important
information on known risk factors for COPD among never-
smokers such as exposure to biomass fuel for cooking and
exposure to second-hand smoke. We attempted to partially
address these limitations by restricting our sample to non-
Hispanic whites and controlling for marital history and
number of housemates, respectively. Even with these ad-
justments, a graded association existed between COPD and
level of obesity.
A major limitation is the cross-sectional nature of the
data, which could only determine association, not causation.
Future research would benefit from prospective large, na-
tionally representative samples of never-smoking older
adults who are free of COPD at baseline, in order to de-
termine if level of obesity predicts COPD onset.
Despite these limitations, this study provides important
population-based findings in older, never-smokers doc-
umenting a robust dose-response association between
obesity level and COPD in both sexes. As the percentage of
never-smokers in the older population increases, con-
comitant with an epidemic of obesity, our findings of
a strong obesity-COPD relation may be of growing rele-
vance to public health in coming years. If this link is
validated and the association is found to be causal in future
prospective research, health professionals should be
careful not to overlook COPD screening and treatment in
their never-smoking patients, particularly for those with
class III obesity and those with alpha-1 antitrypsin de-
ficiency. Clinicians who treat patients with both obesity
and COPD should help patients develop effective weight
loss strategies. In addition to referring to a dietician to
promote calorie reduction, referral to outpatient pulmo-
nary rehabilitation therapy may be helpful. A specialized
rehabilitation program is warranted for those with
exercise-induced
hypoxemia and
obesity
to develop
a therapeutic exercise plan with appropriate use of sup-
plemental oxygen therapy.
