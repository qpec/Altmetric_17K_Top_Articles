IMPORTANCE The idea that abortion leads to adverse psychological outcomes has been the
basis for legislation mandating counseling before obtaining an abortion and other policies to
restrict access to abortion.
OBJECTIVE To assess women’
s psychological well-being 5 years after receiving or being
denied an abortion.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This study presents data from the Turnaway Study, a
prospective longitudinal study with a quasi-experimental design. Women were recruited from
January 1, 2008, to December 31, 2010, from 30 abortion facilities in 21 states throughout the
United States, interviewed via telephone 1 week after seeking an abortion, and then
interviewed semiannually for 5 years, totaling 11 interview waves. Interviews were completed
January 31, 2016. We examined the psychological trajectories of women who received
abortions just under the facility’
s gestational limit (near-limit group) and compared them with
women who sought but were denied an abortion because they were just beyond the facility
gestational limit (turnaway group, which includes the turnaway-birth and turnaway-no-birth
groups). We used mixed effects linear and logistic regression analyses to assess whether
psychological trajectories differed by study group.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES We included 6 measures of mental health and well-being:
2 measures of depression and 2 measures of anxiety assessed using the Brief Symptom
Inventory, as well as self-esteem, and life satisfaction.
RESULTS Of the 956 women (mean [SD] age, 24.9 [5.8] years) in the study, at 1 week after
seeking an abortion, compared with the near-limit group, women denied an abortion
reported more anxiety symptoms (turnaway-births, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.01 to 1.13;
turnaway-no-births, 2.29; 95% CI, 1.39 to 3.18), lower self-esteem (turnaway-births, –0.33;
95% CI, –0.56 to –0.09; turnaway-no-births, –0.40; 95% CI, –0.78 to –0.02), lower life
satisfaction (turnaway-births, –0.16; 95% CI, –0.38 to 0.06; turnaway-no-births, –0.41; 95%
CI, –0.77 to –0.06), and similar levels of depression (turnaway-births, 0.13; 95% CI, –0.46 to
0.72; turnaway-no-births, 0.44; 95% CI, –0.50 to 1.39).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this study, compared with having an abortion, being denied
an abortion may be associated with greater risk of initially experiencing adverse psychological
outcomes. Psychological well-being improved over time so that both groups of women
eventually converged. These findings do not support policies that restrict women’
s access to
abortion on the basis that abortion harms women’
s mental health.

n 1989, the US Surgeon General concluded that “the sci-
entific studies [to date] do not provide conclusive data
about the health effects of abortion on women”1(pg32) and
recommended a prospective, 5-year, longitudinal cohort study
to provide the necessary conclusive data on the topic. Since
then, numerous studies and reviews on this topic have found
no evidence that abortion leads to negative mental health out-
comes, yet they have also pointed to the many limitations of
the existing literature and the need for more rigorous, pro-
spective longitudinal studies on this topic.2-8 Studies finding
a negative effect on women’
s mental health owing to abor-
tion have been critically refuted.6,9-11
Nonetheless, the assumption that women experience ad-
verse mental health outcomes owing to abortion has been the
basis for legislation seeking to mandate counseling before ob-
taining an abortion12 and other policies to restrict access to
abortion.13 Currently, 9 states require that women seeking an
abortion be counseled on the negative psychological and emo-
tional responses to abortion.14
The Turnaway Study is a prospective, longitudinal study
that, for 5 years, observed women who obtained and women
who were denied a wanted abortion. The Turnaway Study im-
proves on the methodological shortcomings found in the pre-
vious literature4 by taking into account preexisting mental
health conditions and examining both possible outcomes of
an unwanted pregnancy—abortion and carrying the preg-
nancy to term. Previous publications using mid-study find-
ings from the Turnaway Study have demonstrated that abor-
tion does not increase women’
s risk of experiencing symptoms
of posttraumatic stress,15 depression,16,17 or anxiety,16,17 or of
experiencing lower self-esteem or life satisfaction.18 How-
ever, some have argued that the negative psychological ef-
fects of abortion are delayed or occur over the longer term.13,19
Our study presents all 5 years of data from the Turnaway Study
assessing the association of having an abortion with women’
s
mental health and well-being.
Methods
Study Design
This analysis includes all 5 years (11 interview waves) of data
from the Turnaway Study.20,21 The study protocol is available
in Supplement 1. Abortion facilities with the latest gesta-
tional limit of any other facility within 150 miles were eligible
recruitment sites. Thirty-one abortion facilities representing
a range of geographical regions were identified as recruit-
ment sites using data from the National Abortion Federation
and professional contacts. All but 2 of the identified facilities
agreed to participate. One facility was replaced with a facility
with a similar catchment area and similar patient volume.
Women were recruited from January 1, 2008, to December 31,
2010, from 30 abortion facilities located in 21 states through-
out the United States. Interested prospective participants were
connected to researchers at the University of California, San
Francisco by telephone, informed consent was obtained orally,
andaninterviewwasscheduled1weeklater.Womenwerefirst
interviewed by telephone 8 days after having or being denied
an abortion, and then every 6 months for 5 years. Interviews
were completed on January 31, 2016. The structured inter-
view guide contained questions about demographics, physi-
cal and mental health, childbearing experiences and inten-
tions,andhistoryoftraumaticlifeevents.Thegestationallimits
of the 30 final participating facilities ranged from 10 weeks
through the end of the second trimester. This study was ap-
proved by the University of California, San Francisco, Institu-
tional Review Board.
Study Participants
To be eligible, participants needed to speak English or Span-
ish, be 15 years or older, and have had no known fetal anoma-
lies or demise or maternal health indications for abortion.
Womenwererecruitedinto3studygroupsina2:1:1ratio.These
groups were women whose pregnancy was within 2 weeks un-
der a facility’
s gestational limit who presented and received
an abortion (near-limit group; n = 452), women whose preg-
nancy was up to 3 weeks past a facility’
s gestational limit who
presented and were denied an abortion (turnaway group;
n = 231), and women who received a first-trimester abortion
(first-trimestergroup;n = 273).Thefirst-trimestergroupserved
to assess whether outcomes differed among women who seek
abortionsearliervslaterinpregnancy.Theturnawaygroupwas
further divided into those who gave birth (turnaway-birth
group; n = 161) and those who miscarried or later had an abor-
tion elsewhere (turnaway-no-birth group; n = 70). The gesta-
tional age limits of each recruitment site varied, so there was
some overlap in gestational ages between study groups.

Key Points
Question Are there associations between having or being denied
an abortion with women’
s mental health and well-being?
Findings This longitudinal cohort study observed 956 women
semiannually for 5 years. Eight days after seeking an abortion,
women who were denied an abortion reported significantly more
anxiety symptoms and lower self-esteem and life satisfaction, but
similar levels of depression, as women receiving abortions;
outcomes improved or remained steady over time.
Meaning Abortion denial may be initially associated with
psychological harm to women and findings do not support
restricting abortion on the basis that abortion harms women’
s
mental health.

categorized women with depression and anxiety scores of 9 or
more as a case of depression or anxiety, respectively.
Well-being outcomes included self-esteem and life satis-
faction. Self-esteem was assessed using a 1-item measure of
global self-esteem, which has been validated as an alterna-
tive approach to the Rosenberg self-esteem scale.23 One item
from the 5-item Satisfaction With Life Scale was selected to
measure life satisfaction.24 For both measures of well-being,
participants were asked to “describe how well the following
statements describe how you have been feeling in the last 7
days,includingtoday.
”These2statementswere“Felthighself-
esteem” and “Felt satisfied with your life.” Participants re-
sponded to these 2 items on a 5-point scale, ranging from 1 (not
at all) to 5 (extremely). Response categories were slightly al-
tered from the original items to achieve consistency between
items.
Independent Variables
Study group, time (years since seeking abortion), and study
group by time interactions served as the primary indepen-
dent variables. Study groups included the near-limit group,
which was the reference group; the turnaway-birth group, our
main comparison group; the turnaway-no-birth group; and the
first-trimestergroup.The15womenintheturnawaygroupwho
placed their newborns for adoption are included in the turn-
away-birth group.
Covariates
Control variables consisted of baseline characteristics known
to be associated with our outcomes. They included age, self-
reported race/ethnicity (white, black, Hispanic or Latina, and
other), highest educational level (less than high school, high
school or equivalent, associate degree or technical school or
some college, and college degree or higher), marital status, em-
ployment (full-time or part-time), parity, history of child abuse
or neglect, history of depression or anxiety diagnosis, prepreg-
nancy illicit drug use, and prepregnancy problem alcohol use
(drinking first thing in the morning or inability to remember
what happened after drinking).
Statistical Analysis
All analyses were performed using Stata, version 14 (Stata-
Corp). P < .05 (2-tailed) was considered statistically signifi-
cant.Baselinedifferencesbetweenthenear-limitgroupandthe
other 3 study groups were assessed using mixed effects regres-
sionanalysestoaccountforclusteringbysite.Anomnibuspos-
testimation test was performed to accommodate multiple cat-
egory associations. For longitudinal models, to assess whether
outcome trajectories differed by study group, we used mixed
effects linear (for continuous outcomes) and logistic (for di-
chotomous outcomes) regression analyses. We flexibly mod-
eled trajectories by testing whether including quadratic or cu-
bic terms for time or random slopes for individuals improved
the model fit and included them if indicated by a significant
(P < .05) likelihood ratio test. We estimated whether trajecto-
ries changed over time or differed by study group via a postes-
timationtestusingthelincomandtestparmcommandsinStata.
Longitudinalmodelsadjustedforbaselinecovariatesthatcould
potentially confound the association between the indepen-
dent variables and model outcomes. Unadjusted results are in
eTable 1 in Supplement 2. Gestational age (number of weeks
pregnant at the time of the interview) was excluded because it
was highly correlated with group owing to the study design. To
graph our model results, we estimated the marginal probabil-
ity of each outcome by study group at 6-month intervals. The
benefit of mixed-effects models is that they produce unbiased
estimates even when some individuals have missing observa-
tions, adjust for differential loss to follow-up, accommodate ir-
regular time measurement, and account for clustering by sites
and individuals, as required for our panel data.
We conducted 2 sets of sensitivity analyses to test the ro-
bustness of our results. The first set aimed to assess the effect
of the recruitment rate on the results by limiting all adjusted
analyses to the 464 women from the 11 sites with a recruit-
ment rate of 50% or greater. The second set aimed to assess
the effect of adoption by excluding the 15 women in the tur-
naway-birth group who placed their newborns for adoption.
Results
A total of 1132 of 3016 eligible participants approached (37.5%)
consented to participate. A total of 956 women (84.5%) com-
pleted the baseline interview, with an average of 5% lost from
wave to wave and 558 (58.4%) retained at the last interview.
There was no differential loss to follow-up by whether women
had a history of anxiety or depression or by study group
throughwave10.Bythefinalinterviewwave(wave11),women
in the turnaway-birth group (82 of 161 [50.9%]) were margin-
ally less likely to participate than those in the near-limit group
(270of452[59.7%];P = .053).Thelastinterviewwavewascon-
ducted from 5 to 6 years after the women sought an abortion
(mean, 5.1 years). The mean for the time variable year was 2.3
(median, 2.0 years). Women participated in an average of 8.2
interviews. The eFigure in Supplement 2 is a flowchart of par-
ticipant recruitment and retention.
At approximately 1 week after seeking an abortion, edu-
cational level, marital status, mental health history, and prior
drug and/or problem alcohol use did not differ significantly be-
tween women in the near-limits group and the 3 other study
groups (Table 1). Those in the near-limits group differed from
women in the other groups in terms of age, employment, race/
ethnicity, parity, history of child abuse and neglect, and ges-
tational age.
Depression
Depressive symptom trajectories differed by group. Women in
the first-trimester group initially experienced fewer symp-
toms (–0.59; 95% CI, –1.10 to –0.09) and a less steep decline
in symptoms compared with those in the near-limit group
(Table 2 and Figure 1). For all groups, depressive symptoms de-
clined over time (eTable 2 in Supplement 2). There were no
baseline differences in depression cases; they declined
significantly for all groups except the turnaway-birth group,
where cases remained relatively flat (Table 2 and eTable 2 in
Supplement 2).

Anxiety
One week after being denied an abortion, women in the tur-
naway-birth (0.57; 95% CI, 0.01-1.13) and turnaway-no-birth
groups (2.29; 95% CI, 1.39-3.18) had significantly more anxi-
ety symptoms than those in the near-limit group (Table 3 and
Figure 2). All groups except the first-trimester group experi-
enced significant declines in anxiety over time (eTable 2 in
Supplement 2). Anxiety cases were initially higher among the
turnaway-no-birth group (adjusted odds ratio, 4.39; 95% CI,
1.18-16.32) compared with the near-limit group (Table 3).

fered by group and improved over time for all groups (eTable
2 in Supplement 2). The initially lower levels of self-esteem

(Figure 2). Women in the turnaway-no-birth group reported
significantly lower initial levels of life satisfaction than those
in the near-limit group (–0.41, CI –0.77 to –0.06) (Table 3 and
Figure 2). There were significant improvements over time
among all groups except the first-trimester group (eTable 2 in
Supplement 2).
Sensitivity Analyses
When we limited our sample to the 11 facilities with a partici-
pation rate greater than 50%, results for the adjusted models
showing associations with depressive symptoms were simi-
lar in direction and in magnitude. Baseline differences in self-
esteem, life satisfaction, and anxiety between women in the
turnaway-no-birth and near-limit groups were similar in di-
rection but no longer statistically significant. When we re-
moved the women who placed their newborns for adoption
from our sample, results for all but 1 of the adjusted models
remained similar in direction and in magnitude (eTable 3 and
eTable 4 in Supplement 2).
Discussion
To our knowledge, the Turnaway Study is the first to respond
to the US Surgeon General’
s recommendation to prospec-
tivelyobservewomenintheUnitedStatesfor5yearsafterseek-
ing an abortion. Our findings add to the body of evidence re-
jecting the notion that abortion increases women’
s risk of
experiencing adverse psychological outcomes. Women who
had an abortion demonstrated more positive outcomes ini-
tially compared with women who were denied an abortion.
Women who were denied an abortion, in particular those
who later miscarried or had an abortion elsewhere (turnaway
no-birth group), had the most elevated levels of anxiety and
lowest self-esteem and life satisfaction 1 week after being de-
nied an abortion, which quickly improved and approached lev-
els similar to those in the other groups by 6 to 12 months. These
initial elevated levels of distress experienced by both turn-
away groups may be a response to being denied an abortion,
as well as other social and emotional challenges faced on dis-
covery of unwanted pregnancy and abortion seeking. The rea-
sons women give for seeking abortion25—not having enough
money, partner issues, bad timing, needing to focus on exist-
ing children, and not being emotionally or mentally prepared—
are indicative of their difficult circumstances at the time they
seek an abortion. The experience of an unintended preg-
nancy may cause women to contend with their circum-
stances and reflect on their lives. When relationships and fi-
nancial situations are thought to be insufficient to support a
pregnancy, this feeling of deficiency, rather than the decision
to abort or the procedure itself, may be the cause of lowered
mental health indicators. These factors, along with the stress
of trying to obtain an abortion, likely diminish over time, as
indicated by the overall improvements in mental health and
well-being outcomes observed in this study. Similarly, Major
and colleagues26 found that women’
s self-esteem levels were
lowest and depressive symptoms highest just before having
an abortion, with immediate improvements observed from the
period before to the period after the abortion. Women in the
turnaway-no-birth group may have experienced the addi-
tional stress of trying to find and travel to another abortion fa-
cility and raise additional money to pay for the procedure. At
the first interview, many of these women reported that they
were still trying to access abortion services.21 These initial ad-
verse outcomes abated after these women miscarried or re-
ceived their wanted abortion.
Earlierstudieshavesuggestedthathavinganabortionlater
in the pregnancy can result in more adverse mental health out-
comes for women than having a first-trimester abortion27 or
that the evidence is too scarce to draw conclusions.2 In our
study, for all but 1 outcome, women in the near-limit and

first-trimester groups exhibited similar levels and trajecto-
ries of mental health and well-being. Women having first-
trimester abortions initially had fewer depressive symptoms
than those in the other groups, but levels among the groups
converged by 6 months.
Similar to what has been found in other studies,2,28 the
most significant factors associated with experiencing ad-
verse mental health outcomes following abortion was a his-
tory of mental health conditions and experiences of trau-
matic life events, such as child abuse and neglect. Women with
such a history are at greater risk of experiencing adverse out-
comes and may have poorer mental health outcomes if they
are denied an abortion than if they receive a wanted abor-
tion.Byunderstandingthateachwoman’
sexperienceisunique
and that women will vary in their responses to having an abor-
tion or being denied an abortion, we can better serve wom-
en’
s individual needs.
One of the greatest strengths of this study lies in its lon-
gitudinal design and use of an appropriate comparison group.
We compare women who have obtained an abortion with
women who also sought but were denied an abortion, 2 simi-
lar groups of women. Prior studies have relied on women with
wanted pregnancies that end in miscarriage or birth as their
comparisongroups,29-31whichisproblematicgiventhatwomen
with wanted pregnancies may differ on several confounding
factors from women seeking abortions. By observing women
semiannually for 5 years, we were able to assess the levels and
trajectories of women’
s mental health and well-being experi-
ences over a long period with more precision than if we had
collected data at fewer time points. Furthermore, while our re-
liance on self-report measures did not allow us to confirm the
diagnosis of mental health conditions, the use of validated
screening tools provides a good assessment of whether pa-
tients were at risk of adverse mental health outcomes.
Limitations
Our participation rate of less than 40%, our loss of 42% of our
sample by the end of the 5-year period, and our differential loss
by study group from wave 10 to wave 11 raise some concerns
that attrition could bias our results. Although our loss to fol-
low-up represented good participant retention of about 5%
from wave to wave, we cannot rule out the possibility that

women with adverse mental health outcomes may have been
less likely to participate and/or to be retained. Mitigating con-
cerns of bias include the lack of differential loss to follow-up
based on mental health history, as well as our ability to con-
trol for history of mental health conditions, child abuse and
neglect, and substance use. Furthermore, our use of mixed
model regression protects against bias owing to loss to follow
up that is predictable from previously measured covariates or
outcomes. Concern about bias introduced by low study par-
ticipation is further lessened by the consistent findings in our
sensitivity analyses restricted to sites with more than 50% par-
ticipation. The lack of change from wave 10 to wave 11 on any
of our outcomes lessens our concerns that differential loss by
study group at the last interview wave affected our findings.
Another limitation is that because this is an observa-
tional study, confounding is a possibility and causal infer-
ence can be problematic. By choosing 2 similar groups of
women, both of whom were seeking abortion, and adjusting
for known confounders and observed differences at baseline
we have addressed the threats to the validity of our findings
on the effects of abortion on mental health outcomes. Never-
theless, there may have been confounders we did not mea-
sure, and our baseline measurement occurred 1 week after the
women sought an abortion and thus may not adequately ac-
count for unobserved factors.
Although the authors of the Brief Symptom Inventory
scales advise that an individual should score 9 or more on at
least2oftheir3subscales,22ourmeasureisbroader,withcases
defined solely on scores from 1 subscale. We excluded the third
subscale—somatization—from our analysis, as somatization is
normally higher among pregnant women.32 This slightly al-
tered use of the scale is likely to result in a higher proportion
of women falling within the range of clinically relevant symp-
toms. Thus, a case does not necessarily indicate mental ill-
ness but a need for further screening.
Conclusions
Our study demonstrates that, during a 5-year period, women
receiving wanted abortions had similar or better mental health
outcomes than those who were denied a wanted abortion. The
convergence of most outcomes between groups by 6 months
to 1 year suggests that future divergence is unlikely. Given the
large number and range of recruitment facilities representing
geographically diverse regions in the United States (30 clinics
from 21 states), and that our sample demographics are con-
sistent with those of nationally representative samples of
women seeking abortion, we believe these results are
generalizable.33,34Thus,thereisnoevidencetojustifylawsthat
require women seeking abortion to be forewarned about nega-
tive psychological responses. Women considering abortion are
best served by being provided with the most accurate, scien-
tific information available to help them make their preg-
nancydecisions.Thesefindingssuggestthattheeffectsofbeing
denied an abortion may be more detrimental to women’
s psy-
chological well-being than allowing women to obtain their
wanted procedures.
