The fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, is an important experimental model to address central
questions in neuroscience at an organismic level. However, imaging of neural circuits in intact
fruit flies is limited due to structural properties of the cuticle. Here we present a novel
approach combining tissue clearing, ultramicroscopy, and data analysis that enables the
visualisation of neuronal networks with single-cell resolution from the larval stage up to the
adult Drosophila. FlyClear, the signal preserving clearing technique we developed, stabilises
tissue integrity and fluorescence signal intensity for over a month and efficiently removes the
overall pigmentation. An aspheric ultramicroscope set-up utilising an improved light-sheet
generator allows us to visualise long-range connections of peripheral sensory and central
neurons in the visual and olfactory system. High-resolution 3D reconstructions with isotropic
resolution from entire GFP-expressing flies are obtained by applying image fusion from
orthogonal directions. This methodological integration of novel chemical, optical, and com-
putational techniques allows a major advance in the analysis of global neural circuit
organisation.

n recent years, the fast development of tissue-clearing
approaches has offered a wide range of tools for studying
deep-tissue structures1–5,6–11,12–14, large neuronal projections,
entire organs, and even whole animals15–20. The main focus of
these approaches was to visualise tissue organisation in vertebrate
model organisms and humans. If animals genetically modified for
tissue-specific fluorescence transgene expression were not avail-
able, the samples had to be immunohistochemically labelled,
which is a difficult, labourious, and time consuming task for large
specimens21–24.
Regarding the fast generation time, large numbers of externally
laid embryos, and the capability of being genetically modified in
numerous ways, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster has proved
to be a valuable model organism to address fundamental ques-
tions in a variety of biological processes25. In multiple disciplines
of Drosophila research, the most commonly used imaging tech-
nique is confocal microscopy following tissue dissection26.
However, when large undissected volumes are recorded, the
drawbacks of confocal microscopy are the low imaging depth, the
long recording time, and the occurrence of photo bleaching.
Without clearing of the sample, strong absorption and scattering
of photons occur by interaction with the tissue, especially with the
pigments located in the eyes and the cuticle. These aberrations
result in a decrease of signal intensity and non-uniform spatial
resolution27,28. Tissue transparency is usually achieved by redu-
cing the refractive index (RI) gradient at the borders between
different cellular components.
Commercially available mounting media, such as DPX,
Glycerol, 2,2′-Thiodiethanol (TDE)29, VECTASHIELD®, Focu-
sClear®, ProLong™Gold, RapidClear®, Histodenz™ or recently
published direct immersion media such as FRUIT6, ClearT7,
ScaleS8, SeeDB9, SeeDB210 and RTF11 have such RI matching
properties. However, each of these solutions has some limitations
regarding the preservation of morphology, fluorescent stability,
viscosity, penetration depth and the capacity to render tissue
transparent8,10,11. Further, none of these media has been reported
to have depigmentation properties. Therefore, heavily pigmented
organisms, such as Drosophila require sample preparation
including the dissection of organs before mounting and imaging,
which leads to tissue damage and deformation. For example,
sensory neurons located in peripheral structures like the eye,
antenna, or legs, establish long-range projections via various
nerves to the central brain, where they segregate into distinct
synaptic regions. Following the dissection and mounting of per-
ipheral and central brain tissues the location of sensory neurons
and their brain connections cannot be visualised in total so far.
Here, critical information about overall neural map organisation,
especially the spatial relationship between cell body position and
synaptic contacts, is lost by animal dissection. Furthermore,
digital reconstruction of separate images is known to be quite
labour-intensive and error-prone.
The importance of visualising distinct cell types in their
organismal context has led to various attempts to image tissue
organisation during development in intact Drosophila in the
past30–32. Despite some progress in the field, previous approaches
in whole fly imaging have shown some critical drawbacks,
including the limitations of specific cell labelling33–35, the loss of
fluorescent signal, the necessity of immunohistological labelling,
low spatial resolution and the need for specialised equipment, e.g.,
the head-array preparation30. As previous studies have shown
that the autofluorescence of optically cleared flies can be imaged
with micrometre-resolution in a short period of time by light-
sheet microscopy36, an efficient tissue-clearing technique, which
preserves the stability of endogenously expressed fluorescent
proteins would be a key innovation to overcome current tech-
nological disadvantages.
Here, we present a novel clearing protocol, FlyClear, which
results in optical transparency of intact Drosophila while preser-
ving the fluorescence of endogenously expressed green fluorescent
protein (GFP) and mCherry.
To gain higher spatial resolution during ultramicroscope
imaging, we used an improved light-sheet generator that pro-
duces a thinner light-sheet with a much-extended length of
uniformity along the propagation axis compared to a standard
light-sheet generator system composed of a slit aperture and a
cylindrical lens36.
In order to achieve a virtual isotropic resolution of the recorded
data in all spatial directions, we implemented a multi-view
combining algorithm computing a three-dimensional (3D) Fast-
Fourier Transformation (FFT) to identify the sharper regions in a
set of image stacks recorded from different spatial directions.
Although combining multi-view microscopy image stacks has
been done before37–43, to the best of our knowledge, it was never
used in optically cleared specimens.
By
combining
our
innovations
in
clearing
technique,
light-sheet imaging, and computational multi-view combining,
we show for the first time the systemic 3D imaging of endogenous
fluorescent markers in intact D. melanogaster for multiple
developmental stages and adult flies with isotropic spatial reso-
lution and long-term signal stability.
Results
Optical tissue clearing with FlyClear. D. melanogaster is a
challenging subject for optical tissue clearing using previously
established protocols9,12–44. The structural features of the chit-
inous exoskeleton and various kinds of pigmentation, including
the photopigments within the compound eye, impede the clearing
process as well as the RI matching to obtain optical transparency.
Furthermore, expressed fluorescent proteins in transgenic fruit
flies are more sensitive to chemical treatment than in other model
organisms such as mice32,36.
To overcome these drawbacks, we developed a clearing method
called FlyClear. Starting with the clear, unobstructed brain
imaging cocktails and computational analysis (CUBIC) proto-
col14, we applied additional tissue treatment steps, depending on
the developmental stage of the flies, and several modifications to
the original reagent-1. For larva and prepupa we used a 0.03%
Protease treatment step prior to formaldehyde fixation. In
addition, a permeabilisation step with acetone was applied for
prepupa after formaldehyde fixation (Fig. 1a). The concentrations
of the detergent and the used aminoalcohol in the new solution
were significantly decreased (hereafter termed as Solution-1). A
substantial change in Solution-1 (see Methods) from the
original CUBIC reagent-1 was the replacement of Quadrol®
(N,N,N’,N′-tetrakis(2-hydroxypropyl)-ethylenediamine) by THEED
(2,2′,2″,2″′-(Ethylenedinitrilo)-tetraethanol),
which
was
also
tested in the original CUBIC paper. This adjustment not only
accelerates the clearing process, but also results in a complete
depigmentation of the compound eye (Supplementary Fig. 1a)
and a sufficient decrease in the cuticle pigmentation (Fig. 1b).
To test, whether the signal quenching effect caused by
THEED, as described before14, is too strong for transgenic fly
lines with a low fluorescence expression level we directly
compared the signal stability in uncleared and Solution-1
cleared half’s of same flies with weak GFP expression in the
antenna (50 neurons).
Compared to the control half’s we observed a significant loss of
GFP signal. However, due to the increased transparency and
reduced autofluorescence we had no difficulties to image the
neurons with the same settings as the uncleared ones (Supple-
mentary Fig. 1b, c).

 The fluorophore quenching effect of Solution-1 led us to test
alternative RI matching media (Fig. 1b and Supplementary
Figs. 1d, e and 2). Ultramicroscope image quality is dependent
on the uniformity and viscosity of the imaging medium, e.g.,
streaks in the liquid can have distortion effects on the light-
sheet. Furthermore, viscous liquids can cause tissue deforma-
tion due to high osmolarity difference between the tissue and its
surrounding. To prevent such effects we decided to use an
aqueous solution of meglumine diatrizoate, a component which
is also used in FocusClear™45. Among the tested RI media, this
solution gave us the best results regarding, morphology
preservation, sample transparency and liquid viscosity (Sup-
plementary Fig. 1e and 2). Meglumine diatrizoate is an
aromatic iodine compound that can be easily dissolved in
water or phosphate buffered saline (PBS) to create a solution
with
a
final
RI
of
1.45
(hereafter
termed
Solution-2).
Additionally, it has to be mentioned that no volume change
could be observed when comparing cleared with the corre-
sponding uncleared side of the flies (Supplementary Fig. 1d, e).
We tested the signal stability of GFP following incubation in
Solution-2 (see Methods) by recording samples at three different
time points under the same conditions (Supplementary Figs. 3
and 4a). We did not observe any significant changes in
fluorescence intensity of individual flies even after 30 days
(Supplementary Fig. 4b, c). Further, we tested the protocol on
mCherry labelled samples and demonstrated the signal preserva-
tion of an alternative fluorophore (Supplementary Fig. 5a, b).
With the resulting final protocol, we were able to generate
significantly improved transparency of larval and pupal speci-
mens and highly transparent samples of adult flies (USAF1951-
chart: group 7, element 6 = 2.19 µm resolution) (Fig. 1b and
Supplementary Table 1) with stable fluorescence intensities over
several weeks (Supplementary Fig 4).

 (FWHM) of our light-sheet to increase the isotropy of imaging in
x, y and z, allowing to view the sample from different directions
with similar resolution.
We used ultramicroscopy for virtual sectioning to achieve
high-resolution images from our cleared Drosophila samples
(Supplementary Fig. 6a, b). A cylindrical lens in combination with
a rectangular slit aperture is the most common approach for
generating a thin light-sheet in ultramicroscopy. Therefore, we
refer to this as the standard ultramicroscope set-up. The process
of the optimisation of the ultramicroscope involves the usage of
various optical components (Fig. 2a). These components change
the phase and other related factors of the incident beam to
reshape it to an ultra-thin beam with improved characteristics.
Combinations of two or three cylindrical lenses can affect the
orbital angular momentum of the laser beam and enables us to
alter the distribution of the output beam46. However, some
limitations and side effects may arise if aberration and related
parameters are not controlled during this process36. One of the
most significant reasons for using Aspheric elements in any
optical design is their ability to form a distortion-free image with
minimal aberration. A laser beam with a symmetrical Gaussian
intensity profile can be converted into a semi-uniform beam by
using two identical Aspheric lenses with a particular surface
design36 (Figs. 2a (1) and (3)). Placing a Meso-Aspheric element,
such as a Powell lens (Fig. 2a (2)), that generates a beam with
semi-uniform intensity distribution between two Aspheric lenses
facing each other enabled us to produce an elliptical beam with a
uniform intensity profile. A thin light-sheet can be produced if
this beam is incident on a unit containing two identical Acylinder
lenses of focal length f that are separated by
ffiffiffi
2
p
f (Fig. 2a (5) and
(6))36.
The output beam can be further improved by using a
custom-made elliptical apodising soft-aperture (Fig 2a (4)). A
mathematical function representing an elliptical Bullseye filter
was obtained by using the size and shape of the elliptical uniform
beam when the beam radius was at its minimum value before the
beam changed the direction of its distribution toward the
converting unit containing two Acylindrical lenses. Thus, a
custom-made soft-aperture was designed and allocated at a
distance of 2Fc, with Fc being the focal length of the third optical
element. The soft-aperture enables us to eliminate the unwanted
intensity distribution in our optical system without creating the
hard-edge aperture effects that we encounter in the conventional
truncation. This alteration is primarily dependent on the
transmission gradient of the aperture. The combination of these
complex optical elements redistributes the amplitude and phase
of the beam in a way that generates a light-sheet with a highly
localised intensity at the focal point and a vastly extended length
of uniformity along all axes. This is achieved while simulta-
neously minimising the power loss when compared with the
standard ultramicroscope set-up.
Using LaserCam-HRTM (Coherent, Germany), the intensity
profiles
across
the
x-y
plane
produced
by
the
standard
ultramicroscope set-up and the aspheric ultramicroscope at three
different positions (focus, 1000 µm, and 2000 µm away from the
focus) were measured (Fig. 2b, c). Based on these measured data,
the FWHM values were determined (Fig. 2b, c).
Imaging in intact Drosophila larval and adult flies. We rea-
soned that the characterisation of complex organisms require
methods for imaging multi-tissue interactions of distant con-
nections in intact samples. We used FlyClear in combination with
the improved ultramicroscope set-up and confocal microscopy to
visualise structures of the sensory-, secretory-, respiratory- and
reproductive system of intact Drosophila expressing UAS-mCD8::
GFP under the developmental driver line Pebbled-Gal447. In 3rd
instar larvae internal tissues like trachea, mid gut and salivary
glands can be visualised (Supplementary Fig. 7a, b and Supple-
mentary Movie 1). In prepupa, the projection of photoreceptors
in the developing visual system (Fig. 3a, b) and the innervation of
the segmental nerves into the ventral nerve cord become visible
(Fig. 3b–e and Supplementary Movie 2). In mid pupal stages, we
demonstrated the high spatial resolution by imaging neurons of
the visual-, reproductive- and the olfactory system (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 8a–e). Additionally, we visualised the neurons in various
appendages of pupae and adult flies (Supplementary Fig. 8f and
9a, b and Supplementary Movie 3).
Precise neuronal circuit mapping in developing and adult flies.
A major advantage of FlyClear is the complete removal of eye
pigments in Drosophila pupal and adult stage, thereby allowing a
detailed analysis of individual neuronal populations and their
connectivity without brain dissection. To demonstrate the spatial
resolution at different levels of the central brain we imaged two
neuron types in the Drosophila visual system, the dorsal cluster
neurons (DCNs) and medulla columnar neurons (MCNs). In
wild type, a bilateral cluster of DCNs in the dorso-lateral central
brain forms an interhemispheric commissural tract to innervate
the medulla and lobula synaptic neuropils in the fly optic lobes
(Fig. 4a, c)48. In homozygous mutants of the neuronal cell
adhesion molecule Neuroglian, the specific loss of the commis-
sural tract can be detected following the FlyClear treatment of
intact Drosophila (Fig. 4b, d and Supplementary Movie 4).
Similarly, for a homogenous group of MCNs in the adult visual
system a single synaptic layer in the central medulla can be
separated from the neuronal cell bodies in the peripheral medulla
cortex (Fig. 4e, f) further illustrating the high spatial resolution in
the analysis of neural circuit organisation in the intact fly.
In addition, we showed with our aspheric ultramicroscope
system the organisation of the undissected visual system of pupa
(Supplementary Fig. 8a, b and Supplementary Movie 5).
Until now, the majority of protocols for investigating neuronal
connections in D. melanogaster involve brain dissection49. This
leads to disrupted connections of peripheral neurons into the
central brain, impeding a complete understanding of sensory map
formation. Therefore, high-resolution phenotypic analysis of
wild-type and mutant neural circuit organisation is impaired.
Applying the FlyClear protocol in combination with improved
ultramicroscopy, we are able to obtain a complete visualisation of
neuronal structures leading from the cell bodies in the periphery
to the synaptic target regions in the central brain (Fig. 5).
For the first time, it was possible to visualise the undissected
projection of sensory neurons from their receptors in eyes,
antennae, maxillary palps and labellum (Fig. 5a) to their
respective central processing areas in the brain (Fig. 5b and
Supplementary Movie 6).
We could clearly resolve small neuronal connections (Fig. 5a, b
and Supplementary Fig. 10). We were also able to follow the
projections of the antennal nerve up to the antennal lobe in detail
(Fig. 5c, d and Supplementrary Movie 7). Furthermore, we
demonstrated that the protocol enables counting of individual cell
bodies in the intact Drosophila (Figs. 4c, d, e, 5a, b inset and
Supplementary Fig. 8bf and 10 inset).

parts that are sharper in one of the two pre-aligned image stacks.
Once these parts are identified, it combines them to a fused image
stack. As already suggested by Shaw et al. and Sätzler and Eils37,
frequency components with higher magnitudes are assumed to
represent the sharper image structures. Therefore, the multi-view
combined stack was obtained by an inverse FFT after selecting for
the frequency components with these higher magnitudes and

Discussion
Here, we present a novel experimental approach that allows the
visualisation of the distinct peripheral and central components of
neuronal networks in intact, optically cleared Drosophila flies in
high spatial resolution.
The FlyClear protocol provides several advantages: (1) it is a
fast and simple procedure that only requires brief immersion of
the flies in two solutions. If confocal microscopy is used,
Solution-2 can be replaced by VECTASHIELD®. (2) It completely
maintains the morphology of the fly tissue along with high
transparency and concomitant depigmentation. The strong
pigmentation of the compound eye is a major obstacle as it causes
absorption and diffraction of the light. FlyClear overcomes this
drawback without the use of bleaching reagents that quench
endogenously expressed fluorescent proteins. (3) Using this
clearing protocol, the endogenous fluorescence signal is preserved
for at least a month without significant changes in intensity. Some
dehydration-based immersion clearing approaches for Drosophila
have previously been published32,36,50. However, it was not
proven whether they are able to stabilise transgenic fluorescent
markers such as GFP. The images presented in these publications

 distinguished from autofluorescence32. Therefore, our protocol
represents a major breakthrough in the field of optical tissue
clearing for insects.
We utilised an aspheric ultramicroscope system, which was
improved with a soft-aperture. With this optimised system we
could exhibit a light-sheet with a very low thickness at the focus
with a strongly extended length of uniformity along the propa-
gation axis and an almost uniform intensity distribution along the
imaging plane.
Unlike other fluorescence based imaging techniques such as
knife-edge
scanning-,
confocal-
or
two-photon
excitation
microscopy, ultramicroscopy of optically cleared samples allows
the visualisation of intact neuronal networks without mechanical
disruptions. Neurites can be imaged and traced along their
projections from their receptor to their interconnections in the
central brain with single-cell resolution. As a proof of principle,
we visualised axonal projections of various sensory receptor
neurons and central brain populations in the adult Drosophila
head and associated appendages to their synaptic regions in the
central nervous system. Furthermore, due to the limited exposure
to laser light, a sample can be repetitively imaged over a long
period of time. X-ray-based methods such as MicroCT X200 or
synchrotron
X-ray
tomography
could
provide
a
powerful
alternative for whole system imaging. However, at the current
state such approaches still have limitations regarding the labelling
of specific cell types, tissue morphology preservation and the
accessibility to a broad group of scientists.
We achieved an isotropic resolution in the 3D-reconstruction
by recording cleared samples from orthogonally tilted direc-
tions and subsequently combining these tilted views into a
single image stack by an FFT-based multi-view fusion algo-
rithm. Due to the uniform resolution, it is possible to quantify
cell bodies of the receptors. Our approach suggests that image
fusion can be an efficient tool in general for creating isotropic

 resolution in ultramicroscope recordings from optically cleared
samples.
We anticipate that the powerful combination of optical tissue
clearing, light-sheet imaging, and multi-view combining will
provide major benefits in different applications. It will fill the void
of whole system approaches in D. melanogaster by enabling iso-
tropic imaging from single neuronal projections to the entire
nervous system. Therefore, the described protocol could poten-
tially provide answers to questions addressing neuronal map
formation. Additionally, other cell populations within and outside
of the nervous system could be visualised in intact flies. This
could enable better approaches to study various biological ques-
tions
such
as
neurodegenerative
diseases.
Complete
new
mechanistic insights should also be possible within the field of
developmental biology.

 Solution-2 consists of 50 wt% Meglumine diatrizoate (Sigma-Aldrich M5266) in
PBS (pH 8.5) adjusted to a RI of 1.45.
FlyClear protocol for larva. Samples were treated at 37 °C for 1 h with 0.03%
proteinase (Sigma, P8038–250MG) in prewarmed PBS to digest the larva super-
ficially. For optical clearing, larva were fixed in 50 ml of 4% PFA (pH 8.5) at 4 °C
for 2 h under gentle shaking followed by 3x washing with PBS at 4 °C for 20 min
each. The samples were then immersed in 10 ml of Solution-1 at 37 °C under
gentle shaking for 4–5 days. The animals were then washed 3x with PBS for one
day at 25 °C. To avoid deformation of the sample, the larva were incubated for 3 h
in a diluted Solution-2 (25 wt% Meglumine diatrizoate). Finally, the samples were
immersed in Solution-2 for 24 h at 25 °C and kept in Solution-2 at 25 °C for
storage.
FlyClear protocol for prepupal stage. A small cut was made between T1 and T2
of each prepupal case to enable better penetration of chemicals and to avoid tissue
deformation, which can be caused by the later clearing procedure. Samples were
treated at 37 °C for 1 h with 0.03% proteinase (Sigma, P8038–250MG) in pre-
warmed PBS to digest the pupal case superficially. Prepupa were then fixed in 50 ml
of 4% PFA (pH 8.5) at 4 °C for 2 h under gentle shaking followed by 3x washing
with PBS at 4 °C for 20 min each. To permeabilise the prepupal case, the samples
were treated for 2 h at −20 °C in aceton before immersion in 10 ml of Solution-1 at
37 °C under gentle shaking for 4–5 days. The animals were then washed 3x with
PBS for one day at 25 °C. Finally, the samples were immersed in Solution-2 for 24 h
at 25 °C and kept in Solution-2 at 25 °C for storage.
FlyClear protocol for pupa. First the pupal case was removed while the pupa
was immersed in PBS. For optical clearing, pupa were fixed in 50 ml of 4% PFA
(pH 8.5) at 4 °C for 90 min under gentle shaking followed by 3x washing with PBS
at 4 °C for 20 min each. The samples were then immersed in 10 ml of Solution-1 at
37 °C under gentle shaking for 3–5 days. The animals were subsequently washed 3x
with PBS for one day at 25 °C. Finally, the samples were immersed in Solution-2 for
24 h at 25 °C and kept in Solution-2 at 25 °C for storage.
FlyClear protocol for adult flies. For optical clearing, the adult flies were fixed
in 50 ml of 4% PFA (pH 8.5) at 4 °C for 90 min under gentle shaking followed by
3x washing with PBS at 4 °C for 20 min each. The samples were then immersed in
10 ml of Solution-1 at 37 °C under gentle shaking for 3–5 days, depending on the
depigmentation level of the compound eyes. The animals were then washed 3x with
PBS for one day at 25 °C. Finally, the samples were immersed in Solution-2 for 24 h
at 25 °C and kept in Solution-2 at 25 °C for storage.
Ultramicroscopy. Cleared samples were illuminated from two sides using one of
two Sapphire lasers, 488 nm/200 mW and 532 nm/200 mW (Coherent, Germany),
producing a beam with Gaussian intensity distribution. A 50% beam splitter is used
to divide the incident beam into two identical beams. They are guided towards two
light-sheet generator units. The details of the light-sheet generators units and the
custom-made soft-aperture are (1) Aspheric lens (f = 20 mm, Linus, Germany), (2)
Powell lens (10° Fan-angle, Edmund optics, Germany), (3) Aspheric lens (f = 20
mm, Linus, Germany), (4) Bullseye filter with elliptical aperture (Reynard Coop-
eration, USA), (5) Acylindrical lens (f = 80 mm, Linus, Germany), (6) Acylindrical
lens (f = 80 mm, Linus, Germany). The description of the light-sheet generator is
given in the patent DE 102010046133B4 and in Saghafi et al.36.
The light-sheet generators are placed on a computer-controlled linear stage (LS-
65, PI-Micos, Germany), which can be moved along the beam propagation axis
generating a light-sheet with an optimal line of focus propagating through the
sample.
A computer-controlled elevation stage with an adjustable precision less than
100 nm (Es-100, PI-Micos GmbH, Germany), and a manually adjustable xy-cross
table for horizontal adjustment is used to scan the sample vertically.
The light detection part includes a customised microscope with modified
objectives for RI mismatch, a computer-controlled filter wheel with different
optical band pass filters for blocking the fluorescence excitation light, and a
scientific grade sCMOS camera (Neo, Andor, Ireland).
A custom-made software allows us to perform an automatised recording of
stacks of images.
Objectives used:
-4x objective (Olympus, XLFluor4x/340, 0.28 NA, WD = 29.5 mm) using
custom-made correction of optics for a RI of 1.45 (WD = 10 mm after
correction)

Fluorescence stereomicroscopy. Cleared and uncleared D. melanogaster were
immersed in Solution-2 and imaged with Leica MZ 16F fluorescence
stereomicroscope using a one fold magnifying, long distance objective (Planapo 1×,
0.28 NA, WD = 55 mm).
Laser-scanning confocal microscopy. Samples treated with Solution-1 and
washed with PBS were mounted in VECTASHIELD® antifading mounting medium
(Vector laboratories, H-1200). D. melanogaster were imaged with an inverted laser-
scanning confocal microscopy system (Leica, SP5) using a 20x immersion objective
(Leica, HCX PL APO CS, 0.7 NA, 260 µm WD), 40x Oil-immersion objective
(Leica, HCX OL APO CS, 1.25 NA, 100 µm WD) and a 63x glycerol objective
(Leica, HCX PL APO CS, 1.3 NA, WD 280 µm).
Image processing. Image processing and 3D-reconstruction was done using
Amira (FEI, USA) and Photoshop (Adobe, USA) running on a Dell workstation
equipped with two 8 core Xeon processors with 256GB RAM and a Nvidia Quadro
M6000 graphics card.
The images were post processed by blind maximum likelihood deconvolution,
adaptive histogram equalisation, and final unsharp masking. Stripes originating
from the image recording procedure were removed using a Fast-Fourier-
Transform-based spatial filtering approach.
Multi-view combining. To achieve a virtual isotropic resolution from all direc-
tions, we applied a multi-view combining approach. For this purpose, a fly was
recorded from different orthogonal directions resulting in pairs of image stacks, I1
and I2, which were tilted by approximately 90° (Supplementary Fig. 11). Using
Amira 5.3, the two corresponding stacks were visually pre-aligned and then pre-
cisely registered with the volume registration tool. The image stack I2 was re-
sampled to obtain virtual slices that were coplanar with respect to the recording
planes from stack I1. After registration, the non-overlapping parts were removed
from both stacks (Supplementary Fig. 11). To this purpose, a binary mask was
generated from Stack I1 by thresholding the intensity values. Then stack I2 was
multiplied with this mask. A second mask was obtained in the same way from stack
I2 and multiplied with stack I1 (Supplementary Fig. 11).
To correct possible brightness differences, we normalised the processed data
sets to their 95% intensity percentile before further processing. We then applied a
3D FFT to obtain the two 3 D arrays, M1 and M2, and the two 3D arrays that
comprise the phase values, φ1 and φ1, from the transformed data sets F1 and F2:

The results from Eqs. (5) and (6) were transformed back into the spatial
domain, rescaled, and saved back as 16-bit tiff-files. The images were reloaded into
Amira and used for generating the final multi-view reconstructed image stack.
Quantification of transparency. We placed the sample in Solution-2 on a
USAF1951-chart. A grayscale picture was recorded with a 4x objective (Olympus,
XLFluor4x/340, 0.28 NA, WD = 29.5 mm) using custom-made correction of optics
for a RI of 1.45 (WD = 10 mm after correction). The transparency was determined
by examination of an USAF1951-chart through the optically cleared fly according

 to Supplementary Table 1. This allowed the quantification of the resolution that
was possible in the specimen.
Quantification of fluorescence signals in Solution-1. We fixed adult flies, with a
weak GFP expression in the antenna (about 50 neurons), in 4% PFA pH 8.5. We
then embedded them in 2% of low melting agarose and cut them with a vibratome
in two almost identical half’s. One of each half was incubated for four days in
Solution-1 the other was stored in PBS pH 8.5 on 4 °C. Because light-sheet imaging
of large samples needs a certain degree of transparency, we used a confocal
microscope to quantify and compare the fluorescent signal loss. We mounted the
untreated and Solution-1 treated samples (n = 3) on one slide in VECTASHIELD®,
because of its fluorescence stabilising properties, and imaged them with the same
settings. It has to be mentioned, that we adjusted the laser intensity always on the
untreated samples to avoid overexposure. The recorded image stacks were 3D
reconstructed using Amira software. For signal quantification, we calculated
brightness intensity histograms within regions of interest, each comprising areas in
the antenna of uncleared and solution-1 treated half’s of the same fly (Supple-
mentary Fig. 1b). We plotted the averaged intensities of the image stacks recorded
at the two different conditions and calculated the standards deviations. Significance
was assessed with the unpaired t-test.
Quantification of fluorescence signals in Solution-2. We mounted Dscam-Gal4/
CyO; UAS-mCD8::GFP flies on a needle tip with UV-glue (Bondic®, Canada) and
immersed them in a cuvette filled with Solution-2 (Supplementary Figs. 3 and 4).
To obtain standard conditions, we recorded stacks of 550 images from each entire
fly using constant laser power utilising an ultramicroscope -system equipped with
an improved light-sheet generator and a 4x objective (Olympus, XLFluor4x/340,
0.28 NA, WD = 29.5 mm) using custom-made correction of optics for a RI of 1.45
(WD = 10 mm after correction). We repeated the recordings after one week and
one month using identical illumination and camera settings. The recorded image
stacks were 3D reconstructed and spatially registered using Amira software. For
signal quantification, we calculated brightness intensity histograms within regions
of interest, each comprising identical areas of the same fly recorded at three sub-
sequent time points. (Supplementary Fig. 4).
We calculated the average intensity of all image stacks recorded at subsequent
days from each fly. To represent identical exposure conditions, these results were
averaged for each group of samples and plotted against the day of exposure
(Supplementary Fig. 4c).
Statistical analysis. In Fig. 1c, data are presented as average ± s.d. For significance,
P-values were calculated using a one-way ANOVA with IBM SPSS statistics
software.

study is available in the Supplementary Software.
