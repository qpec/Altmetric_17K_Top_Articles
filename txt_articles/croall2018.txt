IMPORTANCE Blood pressure (BP) lowering is considered neuroprotective in patients with
cerebral small vessel disease; however, more intensive regimens may increase cerebral
hypoperfusion. This study examined the effect of standard vs intensive BP treatment on
cerebral perfusion in patients with severe small vessel disease.
OBJECTIVE To investigate whether standard vs intensive BP lowering over 3 months causes
decreased cerebral perfusion in small vessel disease.

INTERVENTIONS Patients were randomized to standard (systolic, 130-140 mm Hg) or
intensive (systolic, <125 mm Hg) BP targets, to be achieved through medication changes.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Cerebral perfusion was measured using arterial spin
labeling; the primary end point was change in global perfusion between baseline and 3
months, compared between treatment groups by analysis of variance. Linear regression
compared change in perfusion against change in BP. Magnetic resonance imaging scan
analysis was masked to treatment group.
RESULTS Among 62 analyzable patients, the mean age was 69.3 years, and 60% (n = 37)
were male. The mean (SD) systolic BP decreased by 8 (12) mm Hg in the standard group and
by 27 (17) mm Hg in the intensive group (P < .001), with mean (SD) achieved pressures of
141 (13) and 126 (10) mm Hg, respectively. Change in global perfusion did not differ between
treatment groups: the mean (SD) change was −0.5 (9.4) mL/min/100 g in the standard group
vs 0.7 (8.6) mL/min/100 g in the intensive group (partial η2, 0.004; 95% CI, −3.551 to 5.818;
P = .63). No differences were observed when the analysis examined gray or white matter only
or was confined to those achieving target BP. The number of adverse events did not differ
between treatment groups, with a mean (SD) of 0.21 (0.65) for the standard group and
0.32 (0.75) for the intensive group (P = .44).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Intensive BP lowering did not reduce cerebral perfusion in
severe small vessel disease.

 C
erebral small vessel disease (SVD) causes 20% of all
ischemic strokes1 and is the most common cause of
vascular cognitive impairment.2 It is thought that a
diffuse arteriopathy of the cerebral small vessels results in
hypoperfusion and impaired cerebral autoregulation, with
subsequent ischemia leading to white matter hyperintensi-
ties (WMHs) visible on T2-weighted magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI), as well as lacunar infarction.2
Hypertension is the most important risk factor for SVD.3
Prior studies have reported that more intensive blood pres-
sure (BP) lowering (typically targeting a systolic BP of
approximately 120 mm Hg compared with the standard tar-
get of 140 mm Hg) is associated with a reduction in cardio-
vascular events in primary prevention4 and with decreased
recurrent stroke risk in secondary prevention in unselected
patients with stroke.5 Such approaches may also be benefi-
cial in SVD, but concern has been raised that overzealous BP
lowering could exacerbate hypoperfusion,6 extending
brain injury.
Studies7,8 have shown reduced cerebral blood flow (CBF)
in the white matter (WM) (and normal-appearing WM
[NAWM]) of patients with SVD and have shown that the
degree of hypoperfusion correlates with the severity of
WMHs, consistent with a causal role in the disease patho-
genesis. It has also been demonstrated that the limits of
autoregulation are shifted upward as a consequence of struc-
tural vascular adaptation in individuals with chronic
hypertension.9 This evidence has led to the hypothesis that
a higher systemic BP is required to maintain adequate CBF in
SVD and that excess BP lowering may increase ischemia and
worsen WMHs and cognition.10
However, a 2013 study11 demonstrated that intensive BP
lowering in elderly patients with hypertension without
stroke was associated with increased CBF, hypothetically
due to a reshifting of the cerebral autoregulatory curve. In
addition, a large trial on SVD showed a trend toward reduced
recurrent stroke with intensive BP lowering.12 However,
many patients in that study had isolated lacunar infarction
without WMHs. Whether intensive BP lowering may be asso-
ciated with worse outcome in patients with severe SVD and
confluent WMHs, which is the group in whom severely
reduced CBF and autoregulation have been reported,
remains uncertain. To address this question, we performed a
randomized clinical trial to investigate if standard vs inten-
sive BP lowering in patients with lacunar stroke and conflu-
ent WMHs has different effects on CBF over 3 months.
Methods
PRESERVE Study
The PRESERVE study is an ongoing, 2-year, multicenter, ran-
domized clinical trial that tests standard vs intensive BP treat-
mentregimensinpatientswithsevereSVDonoutcomesofWM
disease (assessed by diffusion-tensor imaging) and cogni-
tion. This article presents a nested substudy that investigates
CBF change over the first 3 months of the trial. The full pro-
tocol can be found in the Supplement.
Population
Screeningbyanexperiencedneurologist(B.M.,U.K.,orH.S.M.)
ensured that all participants had MRI-confirmed clinical
lacunar stroke, confluent WMHs graded as 2 or higher on the
Fazekas Scale,13 hypertension, and no stroke within 3 months
before study commencement. Detailed inclusion and exclu-
sion criteria have been described previously.14 All patients
gavewritteninformedconsent.Thestudywasapprovedbythe
Harrow National Research Ethics Service committee and is
registered with the UK Clinical Research Network.
Apowercalculationusingarterialspinlabeling(ASL)data15
from elderly controls showed that the planned sample size of
60 was powered at 0.9 to detect a 24% reduction in WM CBF
and a 25% reduction in gray matter (GM) CBF (P = .01). Sev-
enty patients with hypertension were recruited at 2 English
university medical centers (41 at site 1 [St George’
s National
Health Service Healthcare Trust] and 29 at site 2 [Newcastle
Hospitals National Health Service Foundation Trust]).
Clinical Assessments
A neurologist or stroke physician (B.M., U.K., or other nonau-
thors) examined all participants. Cerebrovascular risk factors
wererecorded.Ateachparticipantvisit(describedbelowinthe
Trial Design, Randomization, and Treatment subsection), ad-
verse events (AEs) and serious AEs (SAEs) were recorded. In
addition to any general problems that had been experienced
(eg, swollen ankles), participants were asked specifically about
any falls or postural related dizziness that had occurred since
the last visit. Any events reported were classified by likeli-
hood of having been caused by a study drug (rated as none,
remote, possible, probable, or definite) and classed as falls,
postural related dizziness, or other.
Trial Design, Randomization, and Treatment
The PRESERVE study has a parallel trial design. After recruit-
ment, participants were randomized (stratified via site) to
either the standard (systolic BP target, 130-140 mm Hg) or
intensive (systolic BP target, <125 mm Hg) treatment group
(aiming for a systolic BP difference between treatment
groups of ≥15 mm Hg) in a 1:1 ratio via a centralized, online
system (based at the Mental Health and Neurosciences Clini-
cal Trials Unit, King’
s College London) by a research nurse or
physician, who then allocated the participant to the assigned
group. No changes were made to the methods or trial
Key Points
Question Does intensive blood pressure lowering cause
hypoperfusion in severe cerebral small vessel disease?
Findings This randomized clinical trial used arterial spin labeling
to examine the effect of standard (n = 33) vs intensive (n = 29)
blood pressure treatment regimens on cerebral blood flow in
patients with severe small vessel disease over 3 months. Change in
whole-brain cerebral blood flow did not significantly differ
between standard vs intensive groups.
Meaning Intensive blood pressure lowering did not cause
hypoperfusion in severe cerebral small vessel disease.

 outcomes after trial commencement. There were no interim
analyses or stopping guidelines. Treatment allocation
was known to participants and clinical staff (B.M.,
U.K., and other nonauthors), but analysis of data was
performed masked.
Assessments in clinic were performed at baseline, 4
weeks, and 12 weeks. Additional clinic or telephone check-
ups were performed as necessary. Participants took daily
sitting readings with home BP monitors for at least 3 days
before each check-up. During clinic visits, systolic and dia-
stolic BP was measured in a sitting position 3 times after a
10-minute rest period in a quiet room. The recorded BP was
the mean of the second and third measures. At each check-
up, if the participant’
s BP was above his or her study target
(and provided that hypotensive symptoms did not prevent
it), an increase in antihypertensive medication was pre-
scribed. Results presented and used in the analysis were
clinic BP readings.
Treatment algorithms for standard and intensive BP
lowering protocols consistent with the British Hypertension
Society/National Institute for Health and Care Excellence
guidance on drug treatment of hypertension were used for
reference.16 Final treatment decisions were made by the local
study principal investigator (U.K. at site 1 and G.A.F. at site 2).
No treatment changes were made for any participant before
he or she had a baseline MRI scan.
End Points
The primary end point was change in whole-brain CBF. Sec-
ondary end points were change in GM, WM, and NAWM CBF.
MRI Protocol
Site 1 used a 3-T Achieva TX imaging system (Philips Medical
Systems), while site 2 initially used a 3-T Achieva (n = 24) and
then a 3-T Achieva TX (n = 5) after an upgrade (all partici-
pants received both scans on the same scanner). At baseline,
the protocol included 3-dimensional (3-D) T1-weighted (T1W)
and2-dimensionalfluid-attenuatedinversionrecovery(FLAIR)
and pulsed ASL sequences. The T1W and ASL sequences were
repeated at the 3-month time point. Details of each sequence
are given below.
Sagittal 3-D T1W images included turbo field echo, voxel
size of 1-mm isotropic, field of view (FOV) of 240 × 170 mm3,
and repetition time/echo time of 8.27/4.61 milliseconds (site
1) and 9.81/4.60 milliseconds (site 2). Axial FLAIR included
voxel size of 0.48 × 0.48 × 3 mm3, FOV of 230 × 230 mm2,
57 slices, repetition time/echo time of 11 000/120 millisec-
onds, and inversion time of 2800 milliseconds.
AxialpulsedASLincludedFOVof256 × 256mm2,10slices,
and inversion time at the most inferior slice of 1500 millisec-
onds. Site 1 used echo-planar imaging-based signal targeting
by alternating radiofrequency pulses (EPISTAR),17 with a voxel
sizeof3.2 × 3.2 × 6mm3,repetitiontime/echotimeof4000/27
milliseconds, 40° flip angle, and 120 tag/control pairs. Site 2
used flow-sensitive alternating inversion recovery (FAIR),18
with a voxel size of 4 × 4 × 6 mm3, repetition time/echo
time of 2500/12.59 milliseconds, 90° flip angle, and
100 tag/control pairs.
Additional images were acquired for the ASL sequences.
These included M0 and Geo EPI images for EPISTAR (voxel
size of 3.2 × 3.2 × 6 mm2, FOV of 256 × 256 mm2, 10 slices,
90° flip angle, 1 acquisition, and repetition time/echo time
of 15 000/27 milliseconds for M0 and 500/18 milliseconds
for Geo) and sets of 6 acquisitions at inversion times of 900,
1200, 1800, 2100, and 2400 milliseconds for FAIR (same
acquisition as the main sequence).
To ensure standardization, 4 healthy individuals under-
went the full imaging protocol at each site before study com-
mencement. The ASL data were preprocessed using standard
techniques to create flow-weighted images, the histograms of
which were examined, and consistent results between sites
were found.
Data Processing
ASL Preprocessing
Arterial spin labeling is an MRI technique that quantifies
CBF without exogenous contrast agent. It instead uses the
difference in signal between images where blood has or has
not been magnetically tagged and converts this into CBF (in
milliliters per minute per 100 g) via a model that takes into
account variables such as the efficiency of the magnetic tag.
It shows good agreement with contrast-enhanced MRI in
populations with acute stroke19 and is considered a robust
method of measuring CBF.20
The ASL image series were motion corrected using
automated image registration (http://www.loni.usc.edu
/Software/AIR).21 The difference in signal between average
tag and control images was calculated, creating the difference
image (dm). All tag/control images were averaged to create a
magnitude image (M). The proton density (M0) image was
acquireddifferentlybetweenthe2sequences:forEPISTAR,the
M0 image acquired during scanning was used, while for FAIR
it was generated by fitting of the inversion recovery curve
(modeledfromtheadditionalinversiontimeacquisitions).The
dm/M0 images were coregistered to the M image using
Statistical Parametric Mapping 8 (SPM8) (http://www.fil.ion
.ucl.ac.uk/spm/) “coreg.”22
Region-of-Interest Generation
The WMHs were marked on the baseline FLAIR images as
previously described.14 The T1W scans were intensity non-
uniformity corrected (using N4ITK23), tissue segmented
(using “Segment” from Statistical Parametric Mapping 12b),
and registered to their time point respective ASL M image
(using Oxford Centre for Functional MRI of the Brain’
s
[FMRIB’
s] Linear Image Registration Tool, FMRIB’
s Linear
Image Registration Tool,24 and a part of the FMRIB Software
Library25; for site 2, the registration was via the Geo image
to improve registration success). FLAIR scans were regis-
tered to T1W images. Lesion masks and the segmented
tissue probability maps (TPMs) were transformed into
ASL space using these registrations (concatenated
where necessary).
The transformed tissue probability maps were thresh-
olded (at 0.5), binarized, and with the lesion masks used to
create final masks of whole brain, GM, all WM, and NAWM.

 After visual inspection, any voxels that were outside of the
brain (as defined by the M image) were removed from
the masks.
CBF Calculation
TheestimatedsignalinM0imagescausedbycerebrospinalfluid
partial volume was subtracted from the images. Cerebral blood
flow was then calculated26 using MATLAB (version R2015a
8.5.0; MathWorks) (https://uk.mathworks.com/), where blood
longitudinalrelaxationtimeis1550milliseconds,18bloodtissue
partition coefficient is 0.98 mL/g,27 and inversion time of the
most inferior slice is 1500 milliseconds. Other variables
differed between sequences. For FAIR, slice timing delay is
51milliseconds,inversionefficiency(α)is0.99,andtransitdelay
(Δt) is 458 milliseconds. For EPISTAR, slice timing delay is
41 milliseconds, α is 0.9, and Δt is 877.5 milliseconds. The CBF
mapswerecalculatedforeachslice(accountingfortimingdelay),
with total CBF for each tissue being an average of CBF across
slices, weighted by the volume per slice.
Statistical Analysis
Analyses were performed using SPSS (version 23; IBM Cor-
poration). Variable distribution was measured by visual
inspection and Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Key demographic
variables and risk factors were compared between treat-
ment groups by independent t test, Mann-Whitney test, and
χ2 test as appropriate. The number of AEs whose likelihood
of being caused by the study drug had been deemed as
possible/probable/definite was compared between treat-
ment groups by Mann-Whitney test. Baseline CBF values for
whole brain were compared by independent t test between
sites to test for any site-related differences. These analyses
were conducted using all available data, while all subse-
quent analyses considered only participants who returned
usable ASL data sets from both time points.
Systolic and diastolic BP was compared between time
points by paired t tests within each treatment group. Change
insystolicanddiastolicBP(ie,3-monthminusbaselineBP)was
compared by independent t tests between treatment groups.
End Point Analyses
Analyses were performed on an intent-to-treat basis, were 2
tailed with α = .05, and controlled for site. Change in CBF (ie,
3-month minus baseline CBF) was compared between treat-
ment groups using univariate analysis of variance (ANOVA).
The Bayes factor28 was calculated for the whole-brain CBF
model as an additional means of estimating the strength of
the primary end point finding.
Further secondary analyses repeated the above ANOVA
models but only included intensive group participants who
reached their target vs standard group participants whose
3-month systolic BP exceeded 130 mm Hg (thus controlling for
participants whose final BP may undermine study assump-
tions). Finally, multivariable linear regression was performed
comparing change in CBF (in all regions of interest [ROIs]) with
change in systolic and diastolic BP.
Levine test of equal variances and inspection for normal
distributionofresidualswereconductedtoensurethatANOVA
and regression model assumptions were met. An α value of .05
was used for all tests.
Results
The PRESERVE trial began recruitment on February 29, 2012.
The last patient included was recruited on October 21, 2015.
Recruitment across all PRESERVE sites closed on October 30,
2015. Patient flow is shown in Figure 1. Sixty-two participants
returned complete, usable data sets (36 at site 1 and 26 at site
2, including 33 in the standard group and 29 in the intensive
group). Across this group of 62 participants, the mean age was
69.3years,and60%(n = 37)weremale;sexdistributionwithin
treatment groups was 64% (21 of 33) in the standard group and
55% (16 of 29) in the intensive group. Characteristics of those
who dropped out (n = 6) were descriptively similar to those
who remained in the study. For those who dropped out, the
mean age was 69.4 years, 4 of 6 were male, the mean baseline
systolic BP was 152 mm Hg, and the mean baseline Montreal
Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score was 24.50. For those who
stayed in the study, the mean age was 69.5 years, 61% (39 of
64) were male, the mean baseline systolic BP was 151 mm Hg,
and the mean baseline MoCA was 24.72.

 from 154/88 mm Hg at baseline to 126/75 mm Hg at 3 months in
the intensive group, achieving a between-group separation of
15 mm Hg (systolic). Therefore, the mean (SD) systolic/diastolic
BP change was 8 (12)/4 (9) mm Hg in the standard group and
27 (17)/13 (13) mm Hg in the intensive group. Change in systolic
and diastolic BP was significantly different between treatment
groups(P < .001forsystolicandP = .002fordiastolic)andwithin

P = .02 for diastolic; intensive group P < .001 for systolic and
P < .001fordiastolic).At3months,13of33(39%)standardgroup
participants and 18 of 29 (62%) intensive group participants
had reached their BP targets.
Change in CBF Between Treatment Groups
Cerebral blood flow values across the entire sample were
31.6 mL/min/100 g for whole brain, 45.1 mL/min/100 g for
GM, 22.0 mL/min/100 g for all WM, and 22.8 mL/min/100 g
for NAWM. Baseline CBF values did not differ between
treatment groups in any ROI. Individual participant change
in CBF by treatment group is shown in Figure 2.
The primary end point, change in whole-brain CBF, did not
differ between the 2 treatment groups: the mean (SD) change
was −0.5 (9.4) mL/min/100 g in the standard group vs 0.7
(8.6)mL/min/100gintheintensivegroup(partialη2,0.004;95%

Secondary Analyses
Further secondary analyses showed no association between
change in systolic/diastolic BP and change in CBF: the
systolic/diastolic P values for ROIs were .73/.88 for whole
brain, .67/.87 for GM, .60/.71 for all WM, and .65/.75 for
NAWM. There were no differences in CBF change when
groups were restricted to standard group participants whose
final systolic BP exceeded 130 mm Hg (n = 29) and intensive
group participants who reached their target BP (n = 18)
(P = .89 for whole brain, P = .93 for GM, P = .95 for all WM,
and P = .97 for NAWM). Table 3 lists the full results.
Adverse Events
Mann-Whitney test showed no difference in the
number of study drug–related AEs between the 2 groups,
with a mean (SD) of 0.21 (0.65) (median, 0) for the

 Discussion
In this randomized clinical trial, we investigated the
effect of standard vs intensive BP lowering on CBF
in patients with severe symptomatic SVD, as manifested
by both lacunar stroke and confluent WMHs. Our
results showed no difference in change in CBF (of any
studied ROI) over the 3-month follow-up period between
the 2 treatment groups. Furthermore, we found no excess of
AEs in the intensive group, including potentially
hypotension-related events. This provides support that
intensive BP reduction regimens do not cause hypoperfu-
sion in patients with severe symptomatic SVD.
Intensive BP lowering has been shown to reduce
cardiovascular end points in patients without previous car-
diovascular disease.4 However, there is concern that it may
be hazardous in patients with extensive SVD, in whom
reduced CBF and impaired cerebral autoregulation have
been previously demonstrated.10 Therefore, our results are
reassuring that intensive treatment can be used in this
patient cohort.
These findings complement the Secondary Prevention
of Small Subcortical Strokes 3 trial,12 which did not
measure CBF but applied a similar BP regimen to patients
with MRI-confirmed lacunar stroke (but not necessarily
confluent WMHs). The intensive treatment was tolerated
compared with the standard treatment with regard to out-
comes such as SAEs and also showed a trend toward a
reduced stroke rate. However, our findings do not support
previous work in patients with hypertension without stroke
or SVD,11 which found that intensive treatment raised CBF
via resetting of the cerebral autoregulatory curve. This may
be due to patients with SVD having more severe cerebrovas-
cular disease than the elderly participants with hyperten-
sion included in that study, meaning that a potential
increase either may not be possible because of the extent of
their preexisting damage or may take longer to achieve.
The PRESERVE study will investigate this last point when
the 2-year study is completed.
Limitations
Our study has limitations. The ASL sequences differed slightly;
however, baseline CBF values were not significantly different
betweensites.Becauserandomizationwasstratifiedacrosssites,
thisshouldnothaveinfluencedanyanalyses.Theyearthestudy
wasplanned(2010-2011)alsorestrictedASLtechniques;assuch
(and to maintain data consistency throughout the study dura-
tion), recent advances such as QUIPSS (quantitative imaging of
perfusion using a single subtraction) were not used. The lack
of a FLAIR scan at the 3-month time point means that new
WMHs would be classified as NAWM at follow-up (but NAWM
findingsdidnotdifferfromotherROIs,sothisisunlikelytohave
affected any interpretation). Although we achieved our target
treatmentgroupBPdifferenceof15mmHg(systolic),only62%
(18 of 29) of intensive group participants reached their target.
This diminishes power for the primary and secondary ANOVAs
(bydatanoiseandlownumbers,respectively).Whiletheregres-
sionanalysis(whichwouldbeunaffectedbythis)alsosupports
our conclusion of no connection between BP and CBF change,
these considerations, as well as the Bayes factor showing mod-
erate support for the null hypothesis, mean that interpretation
shouldbeapproachedwithadegreeofcaution.Finally,because
patients who had a stroke within 3 months were ineligible for
the study, our findings are not applicable to acute poststroke
treatment.
Conclusions
While 38% (11 of 29) of intensive group patients failed to reach
theirtargetBP,ouroverallfindingsareconsistentwiththerebeing
no association between BP lowering and change in CBF (or in-
creasedclinicalAEs)overa3-monthperiodcomparedwithstan-
dardBPlowering.ThissuggeststhatintensiveBPloweringdoes
not cause cerebral hypoperfusion in patients with severe SVD.
