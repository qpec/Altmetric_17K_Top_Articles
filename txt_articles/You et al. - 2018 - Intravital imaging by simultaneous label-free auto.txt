Intravital microscopy (IVM) emerged and matured as a powerful tool for elucidating
pathways in biological processes. Although label-free multiphoton IVM is attractive for its
non-perturbative nature, its wide application has been hindered, mostly due to the limited
contrast of each imaging modality and the challenge to integrate them. Here we introduce
simultaneous label-free autofluorescence-multiharmonic (SLAM) microscopy, a single-
excitation source nonlinear imaging platform that uses a custom-designed excitation win-
dow at 1110 nm and shaped ultrafast pulses at 10 MHz to enable fast (2-orders-of-magnitude
improvement), simultaneous, and efficient acquisition of autofluorescence (FAD and NADH)
and second/third harmonic generation from a wide array of cellular and extracellular
components (e.g., tumor cells, immune cells, vesicles, and vessels) in living tissue using only
14 mW for extended time-lapse investigations. Our work demonstrates the versatility and
efficiency of SLAM microscopy for tracking cellular events in vivo, and is a major enabling
advance in label-free IVM.

ince the first demonstration in the late 1800s, intravital
imaging has been transforming the way researchers probe
and understand biology1–3. Instead of relying on static
images to infer the possible interactions among different cell
types, intravital imaging allows direct and longitudinal tracking of
individual cells in their native environment. Enormous efforts
have been devoted to developing molecular markers to be used
for intravital imaging to visualize cells and structures of interest
in vivo2,4,5. Although the growing library of markers (i.e., fluor-
escent molecules, nanoparticles, genetically expressed fluorescent
proteins) has enabled biologists to scrutinize various components
in the microenvironment, marker-based methods are funda-
mentally limited by the complicated and sometimes unpredictable
tissue distribution of the exogenous markers, unexpected or
unknown disturbance of biological or physiological functions,
and unavoidable artifacts of non-specific labeling6. Label-free
nonlinear optical microscopy, which produces high-resolution
images with rich functional and structural information based on
intrinsic
molecular
contrast,
has
demonstrated
significant
potential to overcome these problems by leveraging its non-
perturbative nature and intrinsic molecular profiling capability. It
eliminates the need to site-specifically label or target receptors or
cells, and enables a broader array of volumetric signal generation
from tissue structure and molecular composition.
Over the past two decades, a variety of biological phenomena
have been investigated using images based on the auto-
fluorescence of endogenous molecules excited by two/three-
photon processes7–11 or optical emission from specially struc-
tured molecules by second/third harmonic generation7,12–14.
While these studies demonstrate excellent possibilities for label-
free intravital imaging, each modality provides only a sub-set of
the intrinsically accessible information, and promises to provide
more comprehensive and informative images when augmented by
complementary information from other modalities. A recent
study further demonstrated the power of this approach for stain-
free histopathology by integrating these four modalities, visua-
lizing a variety of vital events in carcinogenesis including tumor
cell migration, angiogenesis, and tumor-associate microvesicle
enrichment15. However, similar to previous studies, two major
drawbacks limited the application of this technology for further
preclinical and clinical studies. First, the integration of these four
contrast-generating processes usually requires different excitation
bands and sequential image collection, which increases acquisi-
tion time as well as photodamage risk, and prevents rigorous
spatial co-registration between sequentially detected signals,
especially in living systems. Second, not all endogenous fluor-
ophores and molecular structures in untreated biological tissues
have large absorption cross sections, which directly leads to either
long image acquisition time or poor image contrast.
Simultaneous implementation of multiple nonlinear imaging
modalities has been demonstrated over the last decade. One type
of platform simultaneously collected the structural information
(noncentrosymmetry) of second-harmonic generation (SHG) and
the functional information of two-photon autofluorescence
(2PAF) for nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH, including
its concentration and fluorescence lifetime)16–19 and three-
photon autofluorescence (3PAF) for serotonin excited at a
short-wavelength (SW) band of ≤950 nm, and can thus be termed
as SW-SHG&2PAF(&3PAF) imaging7,9. Another type of plat-
form simultaneously collected the structural information of SHG
and third-harmonic generation (THG, for optical heterogeneity)
excited at a long-wavelength (LW) band of ≥1000 nm, and can
thus be termed as LW-SHG&THG imaging20,21. These two
platforms complement each other synergistically, but were pro-
blematic for efficient integration to simultaneously collect SHG,
THG, and autofluorescence signals using one single (single-beam
fixed-wavelength) excitation. The optimal spectral window for
excitation and emission should also maximize the signal gen-
eration and detection efficiency for each multiphoton channel
while ensuring orthogonality between them for spectral separa-
tion at detection. The need for THG contrast rules out SW
platforms because of the strong UV absorption by tissue and
standard optics. Therefore, there has long been a profound need
to introduce functional information to the LW-SHG&THG
platform in order to empower multiphoton microscopy as a
versatile intravital imaging technique.
A major challenge with the development of a LW multiphoton
platform is the significantly lower absorption cross sections of
intrinsic fluorophores at longer excitation wavelengths. For
example, our previous study showed high-quality 3PAF imaging
of NADH with 1140 ± 60 nm excitation, but this was with an
undesirable cost of imaging speed (pixel dwelling time ranged
from 200 µs to 1 ms)15. In order to achieve real-time label-free
imaging, signal generation efficiency had to be markedly
improved without risking apparent photodamage. Prior studies
have demonstrated fast 3PAF imaging by low-f long-τ excitation
(1 MHz, 509 fs, 1040 nm, 5.9 mW, and 1 μs per pixel)22. Since
nonlinear optical signal (or photodamage) scales with < I(t) > n/
(fτ)n−1 (n—order of nonlinear process; n = 2 for SHG/2PAF and
n = 3 for THG/3PAF)23,24, it is expected that a combined low-f
and short-τ excitation condition, i.e., a large (fτ)−1 (inverse of
duty cycle), would enhance the 3PAF signal at a given— <I(t)>,
which should compensate for the decrease of multiphoton gen-
eration efficiency caused by the shift from SW to LW excitation25.
The photodamage at a typical LW excitation (1080–1180 nm, 80
MHz, 100–250 fs, 120 mW, 3.3 μs per pixel)26 indicates a non-
linear order r between 2 and 3, just as in the case of SW exci-
tation27. Thus, by the use of a larger (fτ)−1 coupled with a smaller
<I(t)>, the third-order nonlinear imaging by 3PAF or THG gains
a favorable signal-to-photodamage ratio (due to 3 > r). Indeed, for
a given imaging SNR, a short τ of 100 fs has mitigated the pho-
todamage occurring at 250 fs in THG imaging26.
Considering all these factors, we designed an optical imaging
platform that performs simultaneous label-free autofluorescence-
multiharmonic (SLAM) microscopy, featuring fast epi-detection
of NADH from 3PAF and FAD from 2PAF, combined with
noncentrosymmetric structures from SHG and interfacial features
from THG (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Note 1). To eliminate the
need for sequential excitation, we shift the excitation wavelength
from the typical 740/900 nm band to a single-excitation band
across
1080–1140 nm
and
simultaneously
visualize
various
molecular contrast via four spectrally resolved detection channels.
To overcome the challenge of weak intrinsic contrast, we use
near-transform-limited excitation pulses with relatively broad
bandwidth (60 nm, 35 fs) at a low pulse repetition rate (10 MHz),
thus resulting in a significantly higher peak power compared to
standard pulses (Supplementary Fig. 1). Images and real-time
videos acquired from in vivo rat mammary tumors demonstrate
the versatility and efficiency of SLAM microscopy for tracking
intercellular and stromal–cell interactions in the non-perturbed
(label-free) living tumor microenvironment. A vast array of cel-
lular and stromal components, including tumor cells, vascular
endothelial cells, blood cells, immune cells, and their surrounding
extracellular matrix can be simultaneously visualized by SLAM
microscopy with high spatiotemporal resolution. This work and
novel method circumvents the aforementioned limitations in
conventional intravital imaging and multiphoton microscopy by
simultaneously and efficiently exciting autofluorescence and
multiharmonic processes, and is a major enabling advance in
label-free intravital imaging.

 Results
In vivo tumor microenvironment by SLAM microscopy. Using
an average power of only 14 mW at the sample surface, images
0.3 × 0.3 mm2 in size were acquired sequentially (each within 3 s)
and then mosaicked to form a larger field of view from an in vivo
rat mammary tumor boundary. Various types of living cells were
visualized within their natural environment, as shown in Fig. 2
and Supplementary Fig. 2, with a significant portion of them
identifiable based on their distinct and reproducible features in
morphology and 4-channel-based optical signatures. For instance,

 tumor cells are identified as tightly packed round-shaped 10-
micron cells with co-localized 2PAF (yellow, FAD) and THG
(magenta, interface) signals, as shown in Fig. 2a and indicated by
the yellow boundaries. The zoomed-in image (Fig. 2b) shows that
tumor cells exhibited weak and homogenous FAD signals in their
cytoplasm, mostly due to the increase of glycolysis over oxidative
phosphorylation
in
(pre)cancer
cells28,29.
Punctate
THG-
associated diffraction-limited dots were found within the tumor,
which are identified as tumor-associated vesicles based on prior
studies12,30. The unique capability of SLAM microscopy for
simultaneously co-localizing the 2PAF-associated tumor cells and
THG-associated vesicles, together with the fact that these vesicles
are usually washed out in conventional histopathology prepara-
tions (Supplementary Fig. 3), suggests the significant potential of
combined THG and autofluorescence imaging for monitoring
tumor-associated vesicular trafficking in vivo.
In addition to tumor cells, multiple subpopulations of stromal
cells that play vital roles in carcinogenesis in the tumor
microenvironment can be observed and followed. One important
prognostic marker for cancer is the presence of inflammatory
cells in tumors31. Figure 2c shows 3PAF-strong (cyan, NADH)
cells (white arrows) with typical morphological features of
macrophages, including irregular cell shapes, oval-shaped nuclei,
cytoplasmic granules, and low nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratios, as
well as a significant increase in cell size32. Another cell type of
interest are vascular endothelial cells, since angiogenesis is a
hallmark of breast cancer progression33. Figure 2d shows two
lines of 3PAF-strong (cyan, NADH) cells (white arrow) that are
aligned and elongated along the same direction in a vascular
structure, a morphology typical for vascular endothelial cells.
Figure 2e shows another larger vessel layered with similar 3PAF-
strong endothelial cells.
To have a more comprehensive view of the tumor micro-
environment, we acquired volumetric images at the center of the
same site (Fig. 2f–h, Supplementary Movie 1, and Supplementary
Fig. 4). At a depth of 80 µm from the surface (Fig. 2h), the image
revealed a vessel filled with 2PAF-associated (FAD, yellow) round
biconcave disks with no signal void in the middle (no nucleus) as
was observed in other cells, which are consistent with typical
features of a perfused blood vessel containing red blood cells34. In
contrast, the vessel (red arrows) in a shallower layer (Fig. 2f) was
found to be comprised of 3PAF-associated endothelial cells with
no evidence of luminal red blood cells, which resembles a hollow
vessel. The co-existence of perfused vessels and hollow vessels
within the same 3-D image stack validates published findings that
aggressive
tumors
augment
angiogenesis
by
forming
hollow channels close to the existing vascular system35. Since
microvessels
and
hollow
channels
are
both
frequently
associated with poor prognosis in a wide range of human
cancers35, the capability of this system for visualizing micro-
vessels and further distinguishing hollow vessels from mature
vessels holds great promise for producing more selective
prognostic biomarkers36.
The color difference among the cells in Fig. 2 is likely to be a
result of metabolic or structural differences. More interestingly, a
ratiometric method using the 2PAF (FAD) and 3PAF (NADH)
channels could potentially serve as an indicator of redox states for
cells in vivo. As shown in Fig. 2, NADH signals (blue) are mostly
associated with vascular endothelial cells while FAD signals
(yellow) are mostly associated with tumor and stroma cells. This
clear and consistent separation between the presumably NADH-
rich cells and FAD-rich cells strongly suggest the feasibility of this
approach for measuring redox state and further distinguishing
not only their cell types but also their metabolic states. In
addition, since every channel is acquired simultaneously under
the excitation of a single beam from a single optical source, this
approach is more robust in terms of motion artifacts and power
fluctuations than conventional approaches where sequential
(different) excitations are involved.
Consistent with previous studies30, tumor-associated vesicles
were abundantly seen near tumor boundaries and at sites of
angiogenesis. Because of the significantly larger imaging FOV
afforded by this platform, different subpopulations of vesicles can
be seen in the same tumor microenvironment. More interestingly,
as shown in Fig. 2b, THG-associated vesicles are usually
associated with tumor clusters while 3PAF-associated vesicles
are usually associated with vascular cells and structures, which
suggests not only the existence of multiple subpopulations of
vesicles in relation to different cell context within one tumor
microenvironment, but also the ability to differentiate these
subpopulations in vivo using these label-free optical signatures.
More detailed investigations on the characterization of these
seemingly different subpopulations of vesicles in association with
different cell types are needed to understand this intriguing
phenomenon. Nevertheless, combined with our recent findings30,
these new results further demonstrate the capability of SLAM
microscopy to simultaneously visualize multiple subpopulations
of vesicles together with various types of cells in living animals,
which offers the potential to shed light on not only the cell-vesicle
dynamics in carcinogenesis but also the clinically relevant
changes that can serve as diagnostic and prognostic markers of
cancer.
Intravascular leukocyte recruitment. Leukocyte recruitment
from the circulation is a hallmark of the initial innate immune
response and a key parameter in assessing immunotherapies.
Using label-based intravital microscopy, leukocyte recruitment
has been observed in different organs of living animals, and a
series of sequential steps have been described: tethering, (slow)
rolling, (firm) adhesion, crawling, and transmigration. Although
it has been shown that the state-of-art label-based methods can
identify different immune cell subsets as well as their surface
phenotype and metabolic status37,38, SLAM microscopy promises
to provide complementary information on surrounding stromal
and cellular components, which can be important to accurately
identify molecular events or interpret the dynamic interactions.
Here, using SLAM microscopy, we visualize the in vivo leukocyte
recruitment cascade in the circulation without the use of any
labels. Two modes of leukocyte arrest are featured in Fig. 3: slow
rolling (Fig. 3a) and immediate arrest (Fig. 3b)39. As shown in
Fig. 3a and Supplementary Movie 2, in the first few minutes, red
blood cells are seen flowing rapidly in the vessels. Then a THG-
associated multi-nucleated cell appears, and begins to roll along
the vessel wall at a velocity of 1.06 µm s−1, which is orders of
magnitude slower than the perfusing red blood cells in the same
vessel, displaying great resistance to the fluid drag force, and
attributed to the strong attachment to E-selectin ligands on the
vessel wall. These multi-nucleated cells are believed to be mature
neutrophil granulocytes due to their clearly multi-lobed nucleus
(Fig. 3a). The strong THG signals are in concert with the struc-
tural features of leukocytes (Supplementary Fig. 5 and Supple-
mentary Note 3), which coherently enhance the THG process due
to the abundant lipid bodies or vesicles within the leuko-
cytes12,14,40. In particular, the lipid granules within neutrophils
could further enhance the THG process, resulting in significantly
higher THG contrast than in other leukocytes40. Figure 3b and
Supplementary Movie 3 show a different site from another
tumor-bearing animal, where we observed the other mode of
leukocyte arrest (immediate arrest vs. slow rolling) in a vessel
branch that borders a developing tumor cell cluster. The leuko-
cyte in the time-lapse snapshots was observed to be captured and

 tethered by the vessel wall with an abrupt deceleration in velocity,
followed by a crawling motion, which typically precedes leuko-
cytes extravasation41. Although it remains to be investigated
whether the neighboring tumor cell cluster has orchestrated the
immediate arrest of this leukocyte, these results demonstrate the
capability of SLAM microsocpy to simultaneously visualize tumor
cells, red blood cells, leukocytes, adipocytes, and collagen fibers in
and surrounding the microvasculature with sufficient spatio-
temporal resolution, and without any use of labels. Based on these
results, there is a high potential for further noninvasive investi-
gations of leukocyte extravasation in disease progression as well
as in therapy assessment.
Interstitial leukocyte migration. A central motivation for
developing this label-free imaging platform is to perform non-
perturbative intravital imaging of intercellular dynamics and
cell–stroma interactions. To examine the capability of SLAM
microscopy for such tasks, and in addition to the intravascular
motion tracking of leukocytes shown in Fig. 3, leukocyte loco-
motion in the extravascular space was tracked with time-lapse
imaging over a period of 70 min at one site that was 1 mm away
from a spontaneously induced rat mammary tumor (Supple-
mentary Fig. 6). As shown in Fig. 4a and b and Supplementary
Movie 4 and 5, we observed marked interstitial chemotaxis of
leukocytes that lasted ~50–70 min and resulted in the formation
of several clusters at a site ranging from 30 to 70 µm in diameter.
Although similar swarm-like behaviors of leukocytes have been
observed and described previously using multiphoton microscopy
based on exogenous contrast42,43, SLAM microscopy promises to
create a more comprehensive picture and interpretation of this
phenomenon owing to its unique capability to simultaneously
excite autofluorescence and multiharmonic processes from the
vast array of cellular and stromal components that comprise the
tissue/tumor
microenvironment.
Consistent
with
previous
experiments,
multi-nucleated
intracellular
structures
were
observed for some of the THG-strong (magenta) cells (Fig. 4c–e),
which resemble the morphology and optical signatures of neu-
trophils. In addition to the observed leukocyte recruitment and
clustering, their interactions with the environment, including
collagen fibers, adipocytes, and blood vessels, were simultaneously
captured, putting the dynamic leukocyte behavior in context with
the tumor/tissue microenvironment, and providing more insight
into leukocyte behavior. Interestingly, since it was possible to
simultaneously visualize collagen fibers using SHG and adipo-
cytes using THG and 3PAF, the clearance of visible fibers and the
deformation of lipid bodies was observed from the location where
leukocyte clustering occurred, possibly through a highly orche-
strated process. Longitudinal quantification of the visible fibers
(SHG, green) and leukocytes (THG, magenta) within Cluster 1
(white box) showed that the density of the leukocyte cluster was
steadily increasing while the collagen fibers began to disappear
(either reorganized or degraded) only after the initial cluster had
formed43 (Fig. 4i). In parallel, the quantification of lipid content
within Cluster 2 (cyan box) showed that over the time course of
accumulation, the areas covered by lipids (NADH detected by

leukocytes to congregate.
We next demonstrated that SLAM microscopy has sufficient
spatiotemporal
resolution
to
accurately
and
quantitatively
describe
cell
locomotion
on
the
single-cell
level.
Diverse
migration patterns were observed in the same environment. A
significant portion of leukocytes were recruited to the cluster with
high directionality and at high speed, displaying peak velocities of
more than 20 µm per min43,44, as shown by Cell 1–15 in the
velocity maps in Fig. 4j and k. Cell 1–14 could be attracted by
short-range chemotactic signals due to their relatively short
traces. Interestingly, despite the fact that these 14 cells show up at
different time points throughout the 70 min, they share strikingly
similar routes, speeds, and directionality when they are progres-
sing to form the same cluster, which is in concert with the well-
coordinated aspects of leukocyte-swarming behavior43. Cell 15 is
representative of long-distance migration (~140 µm) with a
similar high speed and directionality as Cell 1–14. Cell 16,
however, was found to take a random walk path at a significantly
slower speed for the entire time course, displaying a directionality
that is five times smaller than those exhibiting highly coordinated
chemotaxis (Cell 1–15). One commonly shared characteristic
between the cells is their insect-like progression style, as
documented
and
described
previously
for
leukocytes
and
validated here42. As shown in Fig. 4j and k and Supplementary
Movie 4 and 5, most traveling leukocytes moved forward via a
series of repeated lunges, represented by periodic sharp peaks
(rapid movement) in the velocity maps, followed by abrupt and
distinct valleys (pauses).
Besides motion dynamics, SLAM microscopy also promises to
provide metabolic profiling for individual cells at the same time.
By comparing the redox ratio, FAD/(FAD + NADH), of cluster-
ing cells and migrating cells (Supplementary Fig. 7), a significant
decrease (p < 0.01 by Student’s t-test) in redox ratio was observed
in clustered cells, indicating an increase in metabolic activity as
well as a hypoxic environment45. This marked decrease of redox
ratio in clustering cells is likely due to the combined effect of the
large amount of energy consumed by cell transit and the
diminished availability of oxygen at the center of cluster46. This
preliminary analysis further demonstrates the power of SLAM
microscopy to capture cellular dynamics and metabolic activities
at the same time. To fully characterize and understand the
metabolic changes in a triggered immune response, more in-
depth experiments with neutrophils, macrophages, and lympho-
cytes are needed in future studies.
While the majority of extravasated leukocytes were likely
directed by chemoattractants to the inflamed tissue and to form
the cluster, several cells were observed to disappear together with
blood flow. Opposite to the deceleration process shown in
leukocyte arrest (Fig. 3), Fig. 4h showed the process of leukocyte
acceleration in the vessel, with the leukocyte morphology
beginning as a round cell (indicating a pause), becoming
elongated along the direction of blood flow (indicating rapid
movement), speeding up frame by frame, and finally disappearing
into the stream of the rapidly perfusing red blood cells. Finally,
during the time course of continuous imaging (70 min), no
apparent laser damage was noted, and the dynamics observed by
SLAM microscopy are largely consistent with previous reports of

 leukocyte-swarming, confirming the non-perturbative nature of
SLAM microscopy even after long-term intravital imaging.
Discussion
We have demonstrated a single-excitation source nonlinear
imaging platform that shows great promise for label-free, in vivo,
high-resolution, 3-D, structural and functional imaging of cells
and cellular dynamics in unperturbed complex environments.
The advantage of SLAM microscopy over conventional intravital
microscopy or multiphoton microscopy is that by using a
custom-designed window of excitation wavelengths and shaped
ultrafast pulses at a low 10 MHz repetition rate, it is possible to
simultaneously and efficiently excite and detect autofluorescence
and harmonic generation from a vast array of cellular and stromal
components in living tissue. Moreover, long-term observation is
possible because of the lower laser damage threshold afforded by
the longer-wavelength excitation window as well as the low
average power incident on the tissue. We anticipate SLAM
microscopy to be an attractive alternative or complementary
approach to existing intravital microscopy owing to its label-free
nature, relative simplicity, versatility, and rich molecular profiling
capability. Most importantly, few existing methodologies can
provide a direct and fast multimodal visualization of unstained
living tissue with such molecular, functional, and dynamic detail.
In addition, unlike marker-based intravital imaging approa-
ches, the intensity of each channel in SLAM microscopy is pro-
portionally correlated with the concentration of the auto-
fluorophore or the arrangement of the molecular structures.
The four-channel-based optical signatures can be quantified to
objectively describe the metabolic and structural properties of
individual cells, and thus identify different cellular and extra-
cellular components as well as their functional states30. Although
quantitative analysis of molecular structure based on SHG and
THG intensity has been controversial due to their coherent nat-
ure12,47, previous works have shown extensive analysis of the bulk
optical parameters as well as morphological descriptions based on
SHG
and
THG
images12,48.
The
unambiguous
separation
between NADH-rich cells and FAD-rich cells indicates the strong
potential of SLAM microscopy for in vivo redox state imaging in
the future. Since 2PAF and 3PAF are simultaneously collected
and expected to have identical incident power, we could poten-
tially derive the relative concentration of NADH and FAD based
on the known power dependence (power 2 for FAD and power 3
for NADH) and excitation efficiency of the system (calibration
data from FAD and NADH solutions), which should provide a
reliable qualitative assessment of the redox state. Furthermore,
when compared to existing label-free nonlinear optical imaging
techniques, SLAM microscopy promises to have more accurate
multi-channel quantification owing to its single-source single-
shot excitation and acquisition, which renders the analysis less
susceptible to motion artifacts as well as power fluctuations, and
eliminates the need to re-tune or re-align the laser and system
optics between imaging channels.
The interaction between tumors, tumor cells, and individual
components in the tumor microenvironment has become key to
understanding how tumor cells proliferate, invade, disseminate
and metastasize35. SLAM microscopy provides a powerful plat-
form and method to probe the interactive dynamics between
individual tumor cells and tumor-associated stromal cells in their
native environment. In addition, different cell types are found to
have unique and reproducible optical signatures, with 3PAF
(NADH, cyan) mostly associated with endothelial cells and
endothelial microparticles, 2PAF (FAD, yellow) found within
almost all cells and only weakly present in tumor cells, and THG
(interfaces, magenta) mostly appearing from tumor-associated
vesicles. Understanding why these optical signatures are asso-
ciated with different cell types and even different cell functions
and behaviors could shed light onto the complicated roles that
different components have in cancer progression and could
potentially contribute to more selective biomarkers for cancer
diagnosis and prognosis.
Leukocytes have long been known for their fundamental roles
in the early innate immune response and have recently been
associated with key roles in the progression of metastatic can-
cer49,50. In contrast to current marker-based methodologies,
SLAM microscopy provides a new and straightforward approach
to uncover the spatiotemporal dynamics of leukocyte trafficking
in living animal models with less perturbation but more mor-
phological and molecular information from individual cells,
subcellular features, and extracellular environment. We were able
to track the major steps of leukocyte migration without aid of any
markers, including recruitment from the circulation (tether, roll,
adhesion, and crawling) and interstitial migration in the extra-
vascular space (clustering and swarming), with high detail and in
association with their interactions with the microvasculature,
collagen fibers, and adipocytes, which we expect to greatly facil-
itate investigations and interpretations of leukocyte trafficking in
not only the immune response but also in cancer metastasis.
Leukocyte clustering is known to be triggered by various condi-
tions of inflammation, including tumor progression, surgical
operation, and laser damage. The possibility of this clustering
being caused by the surgical procedure or laser damage is low, as
the same experiments have been performed on control animals
with no similar phenomena observed. Nevertheless, more con-
trolled experiments are needed to pinpoint the exact trigger for
this leukocyte cluster formation in future studies. It is to be noted
that intravital microscopists have for decades utilized label-free
transillumination in translucent tissues such as mesentery or
cremaster muscle to study leukocyte traffic, and were able to
differentiate leukocytes from surrounding cells such as endothe-
lial cells and mast cells, thus revealing unique molecular events
involved in the immune response51,52. The capability of SLAM
microscopy to extend such intravital monitoring into 3-D opaque
organs highlights the strong potential of SLAM microscopy to
further deepen our understanding of leukocyte dynamics.
Nonetheless, we expect laser sources with other frequency
shifting mechanisms, such as the Ti:Sapphire laser combined with
an optical parametric oscillator (OPO), which has emerged as a
powerful tool for multicolor label-based imaging53, will also be
suitable for SLAM microscopy on the condition that a strong
excitation at 1110 nm is possible. The custom-designed fiber
source is preferred for this work mainly because of its widely
coherent spectrum (35 fs after compression versus 140–400 fs by
OPO) and low repetition rate (10 MHz versus 80 MHz), which
are essential for generating the high peak-power pulses that
enable near-real-time recording of the intrinsically weak auto-
fluorescence and multiharmonic generation signals (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 1). For future development of portable clinical systems,
this source may also prove advantageous as the fiber-based sys-
tem is simpler and more compact in design with lower-
maintenance compared to the commercially available OPO
system.
In summary, the presented SLAM microscopy platform and
method achieves simultaneous visualization of a vast array of
cellular and extracellular components in living tissue with high
spatiotemporal resolution. We were able to image intercellular
and stromal–cell interactions and dynamics over extended peri-
ods of time with only an average power of 14 mW on the sample.

capability of SLAM microscopy could enable less perturbative and

 physiological, and pathological processes in both basis research
and clinical settings. Furthermore, the single-source single-exci-
tation configuration of SLAM microscopy allows straightforward
clinical translation to flexibly access challenging or deep tissue
sites by an articulated arm, a miniature (laparoscopic) microscope
objective, a fiber-based endoscope, or a handheld imaging probe,
which may be further empowered by adaptive wavefront cor-
rection. For all these reasons, SLAM microscopy marks a trans-

Methods
Fiber source. The pump laser source for fiber supercontinuum generation was an
extended cavity (10.2 MHz) industrial laser (femtoTrain, Spectra-Physics, Santa
Clara, USA). The laser emitted 350-nJ 1040-nm 314-fs soliton pulses at an average
power of 3.5 W. This high peak-power laser necessitated the use of a large mode-
area fiber (PM-LMA-15, NKT Photonics, Denmark) to avoid photodamage to the
fiber itself, and to enable high peak-power coherent supercontinuum genera-
tion54,55. This fiber was optimized over the dispersion-engineered small-core (2.3
µm) photonic crystal fiber that was previously intended for broadband coherent
supercontinuum generation15. The generation of highly polarized coherent fiber
supercontinuum and the construction of the corresponding pulse compression
module largely followed our previous studies30 (Supplementary Note 2, Supple-
mentary Fig. 8 and Supplementary Table 1). The generated supercontinuum was
sent into a 640-pixel 4-f pulse shaper (MIIPS Box640, BioPhotonic Solutions Inc.)
with ~30% throughput. Only the 1110 ± 30 nm band of the supercontinuum was
selected by amplitude shaping in the pulse shaper and used for subsequent SLAM
microscopy. The average power of this band after the pulse shaper was ~50 mW.
Optical setup for the SLAM microscopy system. The SLAM microscopy system
was implemented as an inverted multiphoton microscope (Fig. 1). The 1110 ± 30
nm pulses from the pulse shaper were raster scanned by a galvanometer mirror pair
(6215 H, Cambridge Technology) and focused by a high UV-transmission objective
(UAPON 40XW340, N.A. = 1.15, Olympus), with an average power of 14 mW
incident on the sample after the loss along the excitation beam path. This com-
bination of raster scanning and relatively low magnification microscope objective
resulted in a typical field-of-view of 0.4 × 0.4 mm2. The reflected multimodal
multiphoton signals were spectrally-separated into 4 detection channels by long-
pass dichroic mirrors and appropriate bandpass filters (Semrock, Inc.) and detected
by 4 photon-counting photomultipliers (H7421-40, Hamamatsu) (Fig. 1 and
Supplementary Note 1). The four emission filters were chosen to minimize the
crosstalk between individual channels with specific bandwidth characteristics listed
in the table inserted in Fig. 1. A live rat with surgically exposed mammary tissue
was placed on a 3-D piezoelectric stage to enable mosaic-mode imaging and
volumetric imaging, with the imaging plane placed 20–200 µm below the tissue
surface. Pixel dwelling time ranged from 5–12 μs depending on the temporal and
spatial resolution required for the application, typically resulting in a 2 s acquisition
time for each image. Raw data from the photomultipliers were used to produce all
images without additional processing such as deconvolution or maximum intensity
projection. Because the only purpose of the pulse shaper was for spectral range
selection and pulse compression of the excitation pulses, it may be replaced by a
more common pulse compressor (e.g., a prism or grating pair) for further cost
reduction.
In vivo SLAM microscopy of a rat mammary tumor model. Animal procedures
were conducted in accordance with a protocol approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Illinois at Urbana-
Champaign. To induce mammary tumors in the female Wistar-Furth rats (Harlan,
IN), NMU (N-Nitroso-N-methylurea) (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) diluted in distilled
water (12.5 mg mL−1) was injected intraperitoneally at a concentration of 55 mg
per kg into the left side of the abdomen when the animals (Fisher 344, Harlan,
Indianapolis, IN) were 7 weeks old. One week later, the same amount of NMU was
injected intraperitoneally into the right side of the abdomen. After ~12 weeks of
age, when mammary tumors became palpable, the rat was prepared for in vivo
imaging. Surgery to expose the primary tumor and its neighboring mammary tissue
was performed under isoflurane anesthesia. During the imaging sessions, each rat
was anesthetized with 1% isoflurane mixed with O2, at a flow rate of 1 L min−1.
Physiological temperature was maintained by a heating blanket. Imaging duration
was kept under 3 h to avoid complications of long-term anesthesia. Rats were
euthanized after imaging.
Image processing and analysis. In each frame, the four channels (THG, 3PAF,
SHG, 2PAF) were acquired simultaneously and saved as individual four-channel
images. For mosaic acquisition, tiles were stitched together using a custom-written
MATLAB (Mathworks, Natick, Mass) script that matched sub-image boundaries
based on the predicted position map of each tile. For volumetric imaging and real-
time imaging, the tiles were stacked and displayed as a four-channel video. The
images shown in Fig. 4a–g were smoothed by averaging the neighboring 3 frames
in the real-time video. The raw video and the video after smoothing are shown in
Supplementary Movie 4 and 5, respectively. Without any further preprocessing, the
raw four-channel image/video was loaded onto FIJI (National Institutes of Health)
to apply pseudo-color maps to merge the contrast. The same color maps were used
consistently throughout the study, namely magenta (hot) for THG, cyan (hot) for
3PAF, green for SHG, and yellow (hot) for 2PAF. This specific color scheme was
chosen mainly for two reasons: (1) it improves the contrast between the cellular
and extracellular components of interest; and (2) it provides intuitive interpretation
of the mechanism of the contrast as each individual channel is assigned with a
color that approximates the true emission wavelength.
The measurement of areas covered by leukocytes in Fig. 4i was conducted based
on the prior knowledge that leukocytes were the major source of THG signals in
the specified cluster throughout the measurement window. The same principle
applied to SHG signals representing collagen fibers and 3PAF for lipids in the
specified cell cluster. Thus, by counting the number of pixels with strong THG,
SHG, or 3PAF signals (determined by universal thresholding), a rough estimation
of the density of leukocytes, collagen fibers, or lipids could be achieved. The
individual cell trajectories were extracted from the real-time videos using FIJI
(Plugins, Manual tracking). Then, the trajectories were analyzed by a customized
MATLAB script to quantify the speed and directionality of individual cells. More
specifically, the instantaneous velocity was computed as the migrated distance over
18 s, while the directionality was defined as the displacement divided by the total
path length of the cell56.
