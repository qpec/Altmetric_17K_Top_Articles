Summary
Background The emergence of human malaria due to the monkey parasite Plasmodium knowlesi threatens elimination 
efforts in southeast Asia. Changes in land use are thought to be driving the rise in reported P knowlesi cases, but the 
role of individual-level factors is unclear. To address this knowledge gap we assessed human and environmental 
factors associated with zoonotic knowlesi malaria risk.
Methods We did this population-based case-control study over a 2 year period in the state of Sabah in Malaysia. 
We enrolled cases with microscopy-positive, PCR-confirmed malaria who presented to two primary referral hospitals 
serving the adjacent districts of Kudat and Kota Marudu. We randomly selected three malaria-negative community 
controls per case, who were matched by village within 2 weeks of case detection. We obtained questionnaire data on 
demographics, behaviour, and residential malaria risk factors, and we also assessed glucose-6-phosphate 
dehydrogenase (G6PD) enzyme activity. We used conditional logistic regression models to evaluate exposure risk 
between P knowlesi cases and controls, and between P knowlesi and human-only Plasmodium spp malaria cases.
Findings From Dec 5, 2012, to Jan 30, 2015, we screened 414 patients and subsequently enrolled 229 cases with P knowlesi 
malaria mono-infection and 91 cases with other Plasmodium spp infection. We enrolled 953 matched controls, including 
683 matched to P knowlesi cases and 270 matched to non-P knowlesi cases. Age 15 years or older (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 
4·16, 95% CI 2·09–8·29, p<0·0001), male gender (4·20, 2·54–6·97, p<0·0001), plantation work (3·50, CI, 1·34–9·15, 
p=0·011), sleeping outside (3·61, 1·48–8·85, p=0·0049), travel (2·48, 1·45–4·23, p=0·0010), being aware of the presence 
of monkeys in the past 4 weeks (3·35, 1·91–5·88, p<0·0001), and having open eaves or gaps in walls (2·18, 1·33–3·59, 
p=0·0021) were independently associated with increased risk of symptomatic P knowlesi infection. Farming occupation 
(aOR 1·89, 95% CI 1·07–3·35, p=0·028), clearing vegetation (1·89, 1·11–3·22, p=0·020), and having long grass around 
the house (2·08, 1·25–3·46, p=0·0048) increased risk for P knowlesi infection but not other Plasmodium spp infection. 
G6PD deficiency seemed to be protective against P knowlesi (aOR 0·20, 95% CI 0·04–0·96, p=0·045), as did residual 
insecticide spraying of household walls (0·52, 0·31–0·87, p=0·014), with the presence of young sparse forest (0·35, 
0·20–0·63, p=00040) and rice paddy around the house (0·16, 0·03–0·78, 0·023) also associated with decreased risk.
Interpretation Adult men working in agricultural areas were at highest risk of knowlesi malaria, although peri-domestic 
transmission also occurrs. Human behavioural factors associated with P knowlesi transmission could be targeted in 
future public health interventions.

Introduction
Plasmodium knowlesi has emerged as a widespread cause 
of zoonotic human malaria in southeast Asia.1–3 The first 
naturally acquired human infection was described 
in 1965 in Peninsular Malaysia,4 with spill-over 
infections from the traditional monkey-vector trans-
mission cycle presumed to be rare.4,5 However, modern 
molecular techniques assisted in the identification of a 
large focus of human P knowlesi symptomatic infections 
in Sarawak in Malaysian Borneo in 2004.6 P knowlesi 
cases have now been reported from all countries in 
southeast Asia, with the exception of Laos,2 that 
encompass the geographical ranges of the natural 
macaque hosts (Macaca fascicularis and Macaca 
nemestrina) and Anopheles leucosphyrus group vectors.3 
In routine microscopy, P knowlesi is indistinguishable 
from Plasmodium malariae,2 but can also be mis-
diagnosed in knowlesi-endemic areas as Plasmodium 
falciparum and Plasmodium vivax, suggesting that its 
true incidence continues to be underestimated.2,7
Most notably, Malaysia has reported marked increases 
in knowlesi malaria incidence since 2004—a trend that 
cannot solely be explained by improved molecular 
Plasmodium species con 
firmation.8,9 Malaysia’s national

malaria eradication programme has successfully reduced 
P falciparum and P vivax case numbers to a point where 
elimination of these species by 2020 is considered 
realistic.10 However, the control of zoonotic malaria 
transmission is likely to prove less tractable. P knowlesi is 
now the most common cause of malaria in Malaysia11 and 
is associated with the highest risk of severe disease.11,12
The drivers of the emergence of P knowlesi in endemic 
areas are thought to be predominantly related to changes in 
human land use,13,14 although the prevailing paradigm of 
risk being mostly limited to adult men with a history of 
forest exposure has been challenged by reports of peri-
domestic transmission, including within family clusters.15 
Within this changing transmission context, more detailed 
evidence about determinants of risk is required to design 
and target appropriate interventions; however, to date, no 
formal studies have attempted to identify specific individual-
level risk factors. To address this knowledge gap we did a 
case-control study to assess human and environmental 
factors associated with zoonotic knowlesi malaria risk.
Methods
Study design and participants
In this population-based case-control study we examined 
factors associated with the risk of acquiring zoonotic 
knowlesi malaria in adults and children presenting to 
two primary referral hospitals serving the adjacent 
districts of Kudat and Kota Marudu in Sabah, east 
Malaysia (figure 1). The study design has been described 
previously.16 The study protocol was approved by the 
relevant human research ethics committees of Malaysia, 
the Menzies School of Health Research (Australia), and 
the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (UK). 
The government referral hospitals provide free 
admission and malaria treatment and are accessible from 
all villages in the catchment area. National public health 
guidelines mandate microscopic malaria screening for all 
patients presenting to government facilities with fever 
and notification of all positive cases, thus increasing the 
likelihood of enrolling all symptomatic knowlesi malaria 
cases seeking care.
In brief, patients positive for Plasmodium species 
infection by microscopy were enrolled if they had a 
documented fever or history of fever in the past 48 h, had 
resided in the study catchment area in the previous 
3 weeks, and had not been enrolled previously. 
We randomly selected controls from the case’s village 
within 2 weeks of case detection using updated Malaysian 
government village and household population data, and 
corroboration from health workers and village heads. 
To minimise selection bias, absent controls were revisited 
up to three times before an alternative household or 
individual was selected. We repeated the same selection 
process until three controls had been enrolled for each 
case. Inclusion criteria for controls were a negative blood 
slide for malaria, no history of fever in the preceding 
48 h, not previously having been a case, not previously 
having been a control nor living in the same household 
as a control, and living at least 200 m away from the case 
household. We obtained informed consent for both cases 
and controls.
The selection criteria for controls were designed to allow 
the evaluation of micro-epidemiological human factors 
while minimising confounding effects from village-level 
forest cover, elevation, rainfall, and seasonality.8,9,13 
Controls were not matched on age or gender in order to 
ascertain whether these factors might independently 
affect acquisition of symptomatic infection.
Procedures
Cases were classified according to PCR-confirmed 
Plasmodium spp infection.17,18 Cases and controls completed 
identical 
pre-tested 
questionnaires 
and 
household 
surveys incorporating demographic, social, behavioural, 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched PubMed between Jan 1, 2012, and March 1, 2017, 
with the term “knowlesi”, and then combined with 
“epidemiology”, “risk”, “risk-factors”, “acquisition”, case-control”, 
“cohort”, or “survey”, with no date restrictions for published 
English-language reports. We reviewed all studies identified as 
being related to the epidemiology of knowlesi malaria. 
We identified no previous case-control studies involving human 
infection of Plasmodium knowlesi.
Added value of this study
To our knowledge, this is the first case-control study to assess 
factors associated with acquiring knowlesi malaria. Farming as a 
primary occupation, a history of clearing vegetation or 
plantation work, older age, male gender, sleeping outside, and 
travel history were all independently associated with increased 
risk of knowlesi malaria. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase 
deficiency and residual insecticide spraying of household walls 
were associated with decreased knowlesi malaria risk.
Implications of all the available evidence
The risk of symptomatic P knowlesi infection is associated with a 
range of human interactions in farm, forest, and village 
environments where macaque hosts and mosquito vectors are 
present. Adult men working in agricultural areas had the 
highest risk of P knowlesi infection, although peri-domestic 
transmission did occur, with knowlesi malaria cases including 
infants and people with no travel or work history. 
Individual-level factors affecting zoonotic P knowlesi 
transmission in established endemic areas are potential targets 
for future public health interventions, along with ongoing 
promotion of conventional malaria prevention activities.

household, and environmental variables associated with 
malaria acquisition risk, which were developed through 
prior expert and local consultation (appendix). Responses 
were restricted to the previous month to minimise recall 
bias. Household locations were established with a 
hand-held global positioning system (Garmin 62S, 
Garmin, Olathe, KS, USA). Blood sampling was done to 
measure haemoglobin (Hemocue, Angleholm, Sweden) 
and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) enzyme 
activity (Beutler fluorescent spot test), as well as PCR for 
final Plasmodium species case confirmation. All female 
cases of childbearing age underwent pregnancy testing 
and pregnancy status for controls was self-reported. We 
entered data into electronic case record forms using 
Pendragon Forms VI software.
Statistical analysis
With three controls per case, assuming a probability of 
exposure among controls of 0·1, and the relative risk of 
acquiring knowlesi malaria in exposed subjects relative 
to unexposed subjects of 0·3, a minimum of 210 P knowlesi 
cases were required to reject the null hypothesis that 
there is no difference between cases and controls 
(ie, relative risk of 1), with 80% power and an α of 0·05.19
The primary analysis of categorical exposure variables 
compared knowlesi malaria cases and controls as per 
protocol. We compared odds ratios (OR) and 95% CIs for 
exposure risk, calculated by the Mantel-Haenszel method. 
We included variables with a p value less than 0·2 on 
univariate analysis in the multivariate analysis within 
associated subgroups using conditional logistic regression 
models, including adjustment for age and gender. 
Variables with p values less than 0·2 then proceeded into 
the final multivariate model with adjusted odds ratios 
(aOR), followed by further reduction of predictor variables 
through a process of model-fitting using Bayesian 
information criterion (BIC) and backward step-wise 
exclusion of variables with p values greater than 0·05.
The secondary outcome compared knowlesi malaria 
cases with cases from other Plasmodium species 
combined (zoonotic vs non-zoonotic transmission). We 
assessed non-P knowlesi cases with matched controls 
with a similar approach to the primary univariate 
analysis, then made comparisons between P knowlesi and 
non-P knowlesi models for each exposure variable using 
Wald’s test.
Data were analysed with Stata 12.
Results
From Dec 5, 2012, to Jan 30, 2015, 414 patients with 
microscopy-positive malaria were screened for eligibility 
at the district sites (figure 2). We excluded a single 
remote area in eastern Kota Marudu district because of 
logistical difficulties with study procedures. Of these 
patients, 320 cases were enrolled, including 229 patients 
with symptomatic P knowlesi mono-infection and 
91 with other Plasmodium species infection. 953 controls 
were enrolled, including 683 people matched to 
P knowlesi cases and 270 matched to non-P knowlesi 
cases. The table shows baseline features of cases and 
controls. Four P knowlesi cases had only two matched 
controls, due to the low number of households in these

villages. One non-P knowlesi case had only one control 
enrolled and another non-P knowlesi case only had two 
controls enrolled because there were few households 
nearby.
The exposure variables used for the univariate analysis 
and any missing data are shown in the appendix. After 
fitting, 15 exposure variables remained in the final 
multivariate model (figure 3). Adults older than 15 years 
were more likely to acquire knowlesi malaria compared 
with children (aOR 4·16, 95% CI 2·09–8·29; p<0·0001), 
and male gender was also associated with higher 
acquisition risk overall (4·20, 2·54–6·97, p<0·0001). 
Other intrinsic individual-level factors such as deficient 
G6PD enzyme activity remained protective (0·20, 
0·04–0·96, p=0·045).
Identifying as a farmer was associated with an 
increased risk of symptomatic infection with P knowlesi 
(aOR 1·89, 95% CI 1·07–3·35, p=0·028). 47 (27%) of 
174 male knowlesi cases, and 17 (31%) of 55 female 
knowlesi 
cases 
identified 
as 
farmers, 
including 
individuals with other primary occupations. Occupations 
involving work that occurs predominantly inside or 
around the household or other buildings, such as 
shopkeeping, traditional female household duties, and 
studying, were associated with a lower risk of malaria 
on univariate but not multivariate analysis. Specific 
occupational activities, such as palm-oil plantation work 
(3·50, 1·34–9·15, p=0·011) or clearing vegetation or 
forest in the previous month (1·89, 1·11–3·22, p=0·020) 
were independently associated with increased risk.
Sleeping outside was an independent acquisition risk 
factor (aOR 3·61, 95% CI 1·48–8·85, p=0·0049), as was a 
history of recent travel (2·48, 1·45–4·23, p=0·0010), 
although specifically sleeping outside in the forest or 
plantation during a trip were not significant risk factors 
on multivariate analysis. Residual insecticide spraying of 
household walls was the only malaria-prevention activity 
to reduce acquisition risk in the model (0·52, 0·31–0·87, 
p=0·014). Use of a mosquito bednet remained 
unassociated with protection after controlling for other 
variables. Interaction with monkeys, predominantly long-
tailed macaques (144 [97%] of 148 cases reporting exposure 
to monkeys), was associated with increased acquisition 
risk, although higher frequency of observing monkeys 
did not remain significant (appendix). A history of 
activities taking place in the forest did not remain 
significantly associated with increased knowlesi malaria 
acquisition risk, nor did any other specific recreational 
activities such as hunting.
Young or sparse regenerating forest was the most 
commonly reported vegetation type surrounding 
knowlesi malaria case households (163 [72%] of 
225 households) and was associated with decreased 
malaria risk (aOR 0·35, 95% CI 0·20–0·63, p=0·00040), 
as was rice paddy (0·16, 0·03–0·78, p=0·023). By 
contrast, the presence of long grass around the area of 
the household was associated with increased acquisition 
risk (2·08, 1·25–3·46, p=0·0048). The only household 
construction factor to remain in the final model was the 
presence of open roof eaves, large gaps, or both in the 
walls, 
which 
increased 
acquisition 
risk 
(2·18, 
1·33–3·59, p=0·002), whereas bamboo walls and floors 
did not remain significantly associated.
Adjusted odds ratios for exposure variables associated 
with non-P knowlesi malaria are shown in the appendix.

Compared with children, adults had a lower risk of malaria 
from non-knowlesi Plasmodium spp (OR 0·37, 95% CI 
0·22–0·61), but a higher risk of P knowlesi (3·62, 2·20–5·98, 
p<0·0001; figure 4). Male gender was equally associated 
with acquiring knowlesi malaria as non-knowlesi malaria 
(figure 4). Farming was a risk factor for knowlesi malaria 
but was not for non-knowlesi malaria (2·66, 1·82–3·88 vs 
0·88, 0·46–1·72, respectiviely; p=0·003). Walking to work 
or school was also associated with increased risk of 
knowlesi malaria acquisition compared with non-knowlesi 
malaria. A history of palm-oil plantation work in the 
preceding 3 weeks gave a similarly increased risk of both 
types of malaria. Clearing vegetation or forest in the past 
month (3·49, 2·44–4·98) was associated with an increase 
in knowlesi malaria risk (1·32, 0·75–2·32; p=0·004) but 
not non-knowlesi malaria. Sleeping outside posed a 
similarly high malaria risk for knowlesi and non-knowlesi 
malaria, as did a history of travel. Differences existed 
between the malaria types in terms of type of vegetation in 
the immediate vicinity of the house, with young sparse 
forest not having a protective benefit for non-P knowlesi 
cases (1·63, 0·79–3·38), as seen in the P knowlesi group 
(0·43, 0·30–0·64; p=0·050). Having a fruit tree plantation 
near the house was associated with decreased risk 
of non-knowlesi malaria (0·30, 0·16–0·56), but not 
knowlesi malaria (1·03, 0·73–1·46; p=0·0071). Malaria 
prevention activities inside the household did not seem to 
be protective for non-P knowlesi cases, including residual 
insecticide spraying or mosquito bednet use.
Discussion
In this first, comprehensive assessment of the factors 
associated with acquiring symptomatic P knowlesi infection, 
our key findings support the most common risk profile for 
knowlesi malaria, as consisting of adult men working as 
traditional subsistence farmers, especially those with a 
history of recent palm-oil plantation work. The highest 
individual transmission risk was at the forest-edge, 
including in people with a history of clearing vegetation. 
This finding suggests that recent ecological changes 
affecting the human–vegetation interface are associated 
with spatially heterogeneous P knowlesi infection,13,14 rather 
than exclusively interior forest exposure with activities such 
as hunting. Both women and children were also identified 
as P knowlesi cases, and although agricultural or other 
activities away from the household gave the greatest risk in 
these groups, we also identified peri-domestic transmission 
risk in the immediate vicinity of the household. Strong 
associations with overnight travel and sleeping outdoors 
emphasise the importance of population movement on 
zoonotic knowlesi malaria transmission. Walking to and 
from work also seemed to increase risk compared with 
human-only Plasmodium species transmission. Overall, 
these findings support previously reported data from 
neighbouring Sarawak6 and in Sabah12 showing that 
outdoor farming activities increase the risk of infection. 
These are areas more likely to be inhabited by incriminated 
mosquito vectors, including Anopheles balabacensis,20 with 
the ability to transmit P knowlesi between proximal 
canopy-dwelling macaques and ground-dwelling humans.21
Individual intrinsic factors seemed to provide pro-
tection against knowlesi malaria. In particular, 
phenotypic G6PD enzyme deficiency was associated 
with decreased risk of symptomatic infection, as seen 
for human-only Plasmodium species,22 and is probably 
related to long-term selection pressure from these 
human-only species. This protection is thought to be 
related to increased sensitivity of infected erythrocytes 
to parasite-induced oxidative stress, resulting in im-
paired parasite growth and early phagocytosis.23 G6PD

deficiency has not been reported to occur in 
M fascicularis,24 and is likely to be one of several 
human-only host genetic factors, which, in addition to 
parasite factors such as normocyte binding proteins, 
affect human susceptibility to infection and disease 
severity with P knowlesi.25 The protective benefit of living 
in the same village for more than 6 months could be 
consistent with the development of immunity after 
more frequent exposure. However, given the low 
transmission levels of all Plasmodium species in the 
area,9 this factor might more plausibly be due to higher 
risk activities among recent arrivals, including clearing 
vegetation or constructing new houses from forest 
materials.

Transmission of P knowlesi also occurred in or around 
the household, as evidenced by a small number of cases, 
including young children, with no history of work or 
travel away from the house. Additionally, household 
factors associated with increased exposure to mosquitoes 
such as open eaves and gaps (particularly with bamboo 
floors and walls), the protective benefit of residual 
insecticide spraying on household walls, and a positive 
association between risk of infection and presence of 
monkeys in the vicinity of house and garden all suggest 
some degree of peri-domestic transmission. This notion 
is consistent with entomological findings from a subset 
of participants in this study, with A balabacensis being 
found both inside households, and more commonly 
(five times more) outdoors in peri-domestic areas, as well 
as being more abundant around case households than 
control households.26 These factors are still consistent 
primarily with zoonotic transmission. Although the 
possibility of adaptive human-to-human transmission 
cannot be excluded, molecular comparisons of P knowlesi 
between human and macaque hosts in other areas of 
Malaysia show no evidence of such transmission.27 
Mosquito bednet use did not seem to be protective 
against P knowlesi acquisition, consistent with findings 
from the same study area describing earlier peak biting 
times of A balabacensis in the early evening from 1800 h 
to 2000 h as mosquitoes adapt to human bednet use later 
in the night, with biting mainly occurring outdoors.20 
However, given that lower levels of mosquito biting have 
been reported to continue throughout the night,20 the 
potential of indoor transmission remains. Consequently 
the use of conventional prevention activities remains 
relevant, especially for the large proportion of people 
who did not use a bednet during travel away from home.
Evolutionary understanding of emerging vector-borne 
diseases highlights the role of land use and deforestation, 
with resultant changes in ecological habitats affecting 
vector bionomics that favour increased blood feeding on 
humans.14 Findings from another study in Sabah showed 
marked spatial heterogeneity of P knowlesi village-level 
case incidence that was associated with proximate forest 
cover and historical forest loss.13 Although P knowlesi 
vector sporozoite rates and parity are highest in areas of 
Sabah with intact forest, increased vector abundance has 
been reported in villages20 and areas of disturbed forest.21 
In our study, occupational risk factors for infection with 
P knowlesi such as farming, palm-oil plantation work, and 
clearing vegetation predominantly required a short 
journey from the household or village. This was in 
contrast with human-only Plasmodium spp, which was 
not associated with these risk factors, despite both 
zoonotic and human-only malaria species being 
transmitted by the same vector in this area.20 Additionally, 
the presence of long grass and fruit trees around the 
household were associated with comparatively higher 
malaria risk in the P knowlesi group than in the 
human-only Plasmodium species cases, which was 
potentially related to closer proximity to macaques 
through their foraging behaviour. However, evidence 
suggests that the density of long-tailed macaques in 
Sabah is higher in areas of intact forest than in fragmented 
areas of oil-palm, rubber, acacia, or coconut plantations.28
Limitations of the study include recall bias, given that 
knowlesi cases who were aware of their diagnosis were 
potentially more likely to recall seeing monkeys or 
describe childhood malaria episodes. This study only 
enrolled symptomatic malaria cases presenting to the 
catchment area hospitals, and it is likely that there were 
people with symptomatic but spontaneously resolving 
P knowlesi infections who did not seek the free 
government provided treatment. However, the wide 
age range and geographical distribution of the cases 
suggests that this potential bias did not have a major 
effect. It has also been shown that asymptomatic 
submicroscopic P knowlesi infections can occur,29 with 
this group not seeking treatment and hence not being 
included in this study; however despite being unlikely, 
this was not excluded in controls. Stepwise selection 
of variables could have excluded potential weaker 
associations with P knowlesi acquisition.
Despite the variation in patterns of P knowlesi infection, 
the results of this study would seem to be generalisable to 
other rural forested and agricultural areas within this 
region with a similar profile of cultural activities, large-scale 
plantation or forestry-related work, subsistence farming, 
and recent land use change; consistent with descriptions 
of P knowlesi infection in Sumatra, Indonesia.7,30 However, 
extrapolation of these findings more broadly requires 
further data on population-level P knowlesi infection 
prevalence, complexity of land cover change, and the 
densities and bionomics of both primate hosts and 
different anopheline vectors at fine spatial scales to reliably 
estimate risk of potential spread or establishment of 
transmission in human hosts.3 The effects of forest 
fragmentation on macaque movement patterns and 
subsequent vector interaction and human or monkey host 
biting preferences remain poorly defined, but are likely to 
be affected by human factors assessed in this study.
Risk of knowlesi malaria is associated with a range of 
human interactions in farm, forest, and village environ-
ments where macaque hosts and mosquito vectors are 
present. Adult men working in agricultural areas had the 
highest risk of symptomatic P knowlesi infection, although 
peri-domestic transmission also occurred. Individual-
level factors affecting zoonotic P knowlesi trans 
mission in 
established endemic areas are potential targets in future 
public health interventions, which can be designed to 
reflect the realities of population expansion, wildlife 
sustainability, and agricultural develop 
ment, along with 
ongoing promotion of conventional malaria prevention 
activities.
