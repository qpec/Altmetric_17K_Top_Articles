Abstract 
21 
Beneficial health properties of garlic, as well as its most common adverse effect - distinctive breath 
22 
odour - are well-known. In contrast, analogous research on the effect of garlic on axillary odour is 
23 
currently missing. Here, in three studies varying in the amount and nature of garlic provided (raw 
24 
garlic in study 1 and 2, garlic capsules in study 3), we tested the effect of garlic consumption on 
25 
quality of axillary odour. A balanced within-subject experimental design was used. In total, 42 male 
26 
odour donors were allocated to either a “garlic” or “non-garlic” condition, after which they wore 
27 
axillary pads for 12 hours to collect body odour. One week later, the conditions were reversed. 
28 
Odour samples were then judged for their pleasantness, attractiveness, masculinity and intensity by 
29 
82 women. We found no significant differences in ratings of any characteristics in study 1. 
30 
However, the odour of donors after an increased garlic dosage was assessed as significantly more 
31 
pleasant, attractive and less intense (study 2), and more attractive and less intense in study 3. Our 
32 
results indicate that garlic consumption may have positive effects on perceived body odour 
33 
hedonicity, perhaps due to its health effects (e. g., antioxidant properties, antimicrobial activity).

Introduction 
39 
Garlic (Allium sativum) is an integral part of Euro-Asian local cuisines, both for its specific aroma 
40 
as well as its taste. It is also associated with a wide range of health benefits. For instance, records 
41 
from Ancient Egypt suggest that pyramid builders were fed with garlic to acquire extra vigor 
42 
(Rivlin, 2001), and several cloves of garlic were found in the tomb of the pharaoh Tutankhamun. 
43 
Pliny the elder prescribed garlic for treating gastrointestinal disorders, asthma, madness, tumors, 
44 
and worms. Furthermore, it was used for medical purposes by other ancient medical authorities such 
45 
as Hippocrates, Aristophanes and Galen (Block, 1985). The antibacterial properties of garlic were 
46 
recognized by Louis Pasteur and, during the Second World War, garlic was used as an antiseptic in 
47 
the prevention of gangrene (Afzal, Ali, Thomson, & Armstrong, 2000). Garlic has thus acquired a 
48 
longstanding reputation as a therapeutic medicinal agent.  
49 
Nowadays, well-known medical properties involve several major domains including antioxidant, 
50 
immunostimulant, cardiovascular, bactericidal, and oncological effects. Several studies reported 
51 
 3 
 
that garlic consumption significantly increases antioxidant activity in various tissues (Banerjee, 
52 
Dinda, Manchanda, & Maulik, 2002; Wei & Lau, 1998); presumably by reducing reactive oxygen 
53 
species or by interacting with them to protect vascular endothelial cells from oxidant injury 
54 
(Amagase, 2006). Garlic ingestion might also influence immune response, as it stimulates 
55 
proliferation of lymphocytes, influences macrophage phagocytosis, and enhances activities of 
56 
natural killer cells and lymphokine-activated killer cells (Amagase, Petesch, Matsuura, Kasuga, & 
57 
Itakura, 2001, Lamm & Riggs, 2001). Furthermore, significant effects of garlic on the 
58 
cardiovascular system, such as platelet aggregation inhibition (Srivastava & Tyagi, 1993), decreases 
59 
in fibrinolytic activity (Butt, Sultan, Butt, & Iqbal, 2009), and an antihypertensive effect (Ried, 
60 
Frank, Stocks, Fakler, & Sullivan, 2008) have been reported; perhaps due to its influence on plasma 
61 
lipid metabolism. Garlic is further known to have inhibitory activity on various pathogenic bacteria, 
62 
viruses and fungi (Ankri & Mirelman, 1999). Moreover, several epidemiological studies reported 
63 
associations between garlic consumption and lower risk of acquiring (or death caused by) several 
64 
types of cancer (Mei et al., 1982, Hsing et al., 2002, Zheng et al., 1992, Steinmetz, Kushi, Bostick, 
65 
Folsom, & Potter, 1994). Suggested mechanisms of garlic’s anticancer efficacy, based on 
66 
experimental studies, include antioxidant action, inhibition of DNA adduct formation, 
67 
antiproliferating activities (Shukla & Kalra, 2007), induction of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest 
68 
(Iciek, Kwiecień, & Włodek, 2009). 
69 
Apart from the wide range of health benefits attributed to garlic consumption, adverse effects have 
70 
also been reported. The most common of these is unpleasant garlic breath and body odour 
71 
(Amagase, 2006; Borrelli, Capasso, & Izzo, 2007). Suarez et al. (1999) attempted to reveal the 
72 
mechanism behind this effect and investigated the origin of odoriferous gases (i.e., gut versus 
73 
mouth) following garlic ingestion. Concentrations of all sulfur-containing gases decreased after 3 
74 
hours except allyl methyl sulfide, which became the predominant sulfur gas present in breath 
75 
(Suarez et al., 1999). Other studies showed that garlic consumption may also affect the odour of 
76 
human breast milk and amniotic fluid. After ingestion of garlic capsules by breast-feeding women, 
77 
the odour of breast milk was perceived by adult panelists as more intense; moreover, infants spent 
78 
more time attached to their mother´s breast and fed more vigorously (Mennella & Beauchamp, 
79 
1991). Similarly, babies without previous experience of garlic spent more time breast-feeding and 
80 
more time attached to the nipple after their mothers ingested garlic capsules compared to infants 
81 
whose mothers repeatedly consumed garlic during an experimental period. These findings suggest 
82 
that infants repeatedly exposed to garlic flavor in mother´s milk become habituated to the flavor 
83 
(Mennella & Beauchamp, 1993). Another study showed that garlic consumption influenced the 
84 
 4 
 
odour of amniotic fluid, as samples obtained from women who had ingested garlic capsules were 
85 
judged to be stronger or more garlic-like than samples collected from women consuming placebo 
86 
capsules (Mennella, Johnson, Staley, & Beauchamp, 1995).  
87 
In contrast to the evidence reviewed above, there is currently no direct empirical evidence that 
88 
garlic consumption similarly influences axillary odour. One may expect such an effect as the studies 
89 
involving breast and amniotic fluid odour indicate that volatile molecules are transported from the 
90 
digestive system to the bloodstream. Subsequently, the volatile molecules could be transported from 
91 
arteries to eccrine or other skin glands which subsequently secrete these compounds onto the skin 
92 
surface. Furthermore, several anecdotal accounts point to the smell of garlic from the skin 
93 
(Amagase et al., 2001; Borrelli et al., 2007; Stevinson, Pittler, & Ernst, 2001). Indeed, previous 
94 
studies have shown that diet can also affect axillary odour (for review, see Havlicek & Lenochova, 
95 
2008). For instance, Havlicek and Lenochova (2006) found that body odour of individuals on a non-
96 
meat diet was perceived as more pleasant, attractive and less intense compared to the same 
97 
individuals on a meat diet. 
98 
Our main aim in this study was therefore to test the effect of garlic consumption on axillary odour 
99 
hedonicity. We conducted three studies, varying the amount of garlic consumed and the nature and 
100 
origin of the odoriferous molecules involved. 
101 
Material and methods 
102 
Participants  
103 
Odour donors 
104 
Ten men, mean age 25.2 (range 18 - 31 years), body weight 73.4 kg (range 55 - 96 kg) and body 
105 
height 179.5 cm (range 174 - 186 cm), mostly students at Charles University in Prague, participated 
106 
in the first study. Another 16 men, mean age 25.1 (range 20 - 34 years), body weight 75.3 kg (range 
107 
54 - 103 kg) and body height 179.4 cm (range 169 - 193 cm) took part in the second study; in the 
108 
third, a further 16 men, mean age 25.8 (range 19 – 35 years), body weight 75.3 kg (range 62 - 105 
109 
kg) and body height 179.9 cm (range 170 - 188 cm) participated. All were recruited via posters or 
110 
contacted via e-mail by JF. All were non-smokers, reported no dermatological or other diseases at 
111 
the time of the study, and did not shave their armpits. The axillary shaving was kept constant as it 
112 
might affect perceived quality of the axillary odour (Kohoutová, Rubešová, & Havlíček, 2011). The 
113 
donors were given 400 CZK (approximately 20 USD) as compensation for their time and potential 
114 
inconvenience caused by the prescribed diet.  
115 
 5 
 
Raters 
116 
Fourteen women (mean age 24.6; range 20 - 35 years) took part in the first study. In the second and 
117 
third studies, a further 40 (mean age 22.5; range 19 - 32 years) and 28 (mean age 22.6; range 19 - 36 
118 
years) raters took part. . All were Charles University students and were contacted via e-mail or 
119 
posters. All were using hormonal contraception, to avoid changes in olfactory perception during the 
120 
menstrual cycle (Doty, 1981; Navarrete-Palacios, Hudson, Reyes-Guerrero, & Guevara-Guzman, 
121 
2003; Martinec Nováková, Havlíček, & Roberts, 2014). In the first study, the raters received a 
122 
chocolate bar, while in the second and third studies they were given 100 CZK (approximately 5 
123 
USD) as compensation for their time.  
124 
Odour sampling procedure 
125 
We used a balanced within-subject design in which odour donors were randomly assigned to one of 
126 
two groups (A, B). Odour donors in group A were in the “garlic” condition during the first session, 
127 
while those in group B were in the ”non-garlic” condition; conditions were reversed in the second 
128 
session which took place one week apart. In study 1, donors in group A ate a slice of bread with 6g 
129 
of crushed garlic (approximately 2 cloves of fresh garlic) mixed with fresh cheese, while those in 
130 
group B ate a slice of bread with fresh cheese only. The dosage of garlic (6g) we used corresponds 
131 
to the recommended daily amount (Amagase et al., 2001; Staba, Lash, & Staba, 2001) and was also 
132 
employed in previous studies assessing garlic gases in the oral cavity and intestines (Suarez et al., 
133 
1999). To test the effect of dosage, in study 2 we doubled the original dose (to 12g). In the third 
134 
study, donors in group A were given 12 commercially available Walmark Alicin 1000 mg garlic 
135 
capsules 
(http://www.walmark.eu/eu/pages/products.aspx?nl_product_id=1017), 
each 
capsule 
136 
containing 1000 mg of garlic extract which corresponds to 12g of fresh garlic dissolved in soybean 
137 
oil, while those in group B received a placebo (capsules with soybean oil).  
138 
Each participant received a written list of instructions. The day before sampling and during the 
139 
sampling day, they were asked to refrain from (i) using perfumes, deodorants, antiperspirants, 
140 
aftershave and shower gels, (ii) eating meals containing garlic, onion, chilli, pepper, vinegar, blue 
141 
cheese, cabbage, radish, fermented milk products, marinated fish, (iii) drinking alcoholic beverages 
142 
or using other drugs and (iv) smoking. They were further asked to avoid strenuous physical (e. g., 
143 
jogging, aerobic), and sexual activities or sharing bed with their partner or pet during sampling. The 
144 
night before sampling and in the following morning the donors were asked to wash without using 
145 
soap or shower gel. The next evening, between 17 and 19 hours, they visited the laboratory where 
146 
they received their garlic dose (see above) and subsequently washed their armpits using non-
147 
perfumed soap (Neutral, DM-drogerie markt, www.dm-drogeriemarkt.cz, Prague). They then fixed 
148 
 6 
 
a cotton pad (elliptical in shape, approximately 9 x 7cm at their longest axis, Ebelin cosmetic pads, 
149 
DM-drogerie markt, www.dm-drogeriemarkt.cz, Prague) to either armpit using surgical tape 
150 
(Omnipur, DM-drogeriemarkt, www.dm-drogeriemarkt.cz, Prague). They then left the laboratory 
151 
and continued to wear the pads for the following 12h. Collection of axillary odours by use of cotton 
152 
pads has been employed in several previous studies (e. g., Ferdenzi et al., 2011; Havlicek & 
153 
Lenochova, 2006; Havlíček, Lenochová, Oberzaucher, Grammer, & Roberts, 2011; Roberts et al., 
154 
2011). To avoid odour contamination from odour donors’ own clothing, or by other extrinsic 
155 
ambient odours, the donors were asked to wear new white 100% cotton T-shirts (previously washed 
156 
without washing powder) as their first layer of clothing. We did not control their food intake before 
157 
the onset of the study, however, they were asked not to consume further meals while wearing pads. 
158 
The next morning, they put the pads into zip-lock plastic bags and handed these back to the 
159 
experimenters. The samples were immediately placed in a freezer at -32°C; so long as samples are 
160 
thawed before rating, freezing has no significant effect on hedonic ratings (Lenochova, Roberts, & 
161 
Havlicek, 2008; Roberts, Gosling, Carter, & Petrie, 2008).  
162 
Donors’ conformity with the instructions was checked by a questionnaire. No serious violations, 
163 
particularly on the day of sampling, were found. In the first study, one donor in the experimental 
164 
condition reported eating garlic and another used a shower gel during the first session. During the 
165 
second session one donor reported eating onion; two others had a glass of beer (0.5 l) and one used 
166 
a perfume. In the second study, two donors reported using shower gel and one donor had wine 
167 
during the first session. During the second session one donor used shower gel, one ate a fermented 
168 
milk product and the other had a glass of beer. In the third study, two donors reported eating onion 
169 
and another two using shower gel; one had one glass of wine during the first session. During the 
170 
second session, two donors had consumed fermented milk products, one ate onion, and another had 
171 
a glass of wine (2 dcl). However, exclusion of these samples from the statistical analysis did not 
172 
significantly affect the findings.  
173 
Odour rating procedure 
174 
Ratings took place in a quiet, ventilated room. The temperature across all three studies was between 
175 
20.9 and 22.4°C (30%-37% humidity). One randomly selected stimulus (a pad worn in the left or 
176 
right armpit) from each participant was enclosed in a 250 ml opaque jar labelled by a code. The 
177 
armpit (left, right) from which the odour stimulus was used was kept constant across both testing 
178 
sessions. Pads were presented as pairs, with each pair consisting of samples acquired from the garlic 
179 
and non-garlic condition of a particular donor. Raters were instructed not to use the same value 
180 
within each pair (samples of one person) for any of the assessed variables (e. g., pleasantness). This 
181 
 7 
 
procedure (the equivalent of a forced-choice test) is designed to detect subtle effects as it clarifies 
182 
differences between the tested groups. Each rater assessed all collected paired samples from the 
183 
donors (i. e., 10, 16 and 16 pairs of pads across the first, second and third study, respectively). 
184 
However, to avoid odour adaptation, the samples were randomly split into sub-sets (2 groups in 
185 
study 1, 3 groups in studies 2 and 3), and raters were given a break between assessing each set. 
186 
During breaks, raters were offered mineral water and completed an additional questionnaire. Raters 
187 
were asked to rate male body odour samples and stimuli were assessed on a 7-point scale for their 
188 
(i) pleasantness, (ii) attractiveness, (iii) masculinity and (iv) intensity. Both ends of each scale were 
189 
anchored by verbal descriptions (e.g., very unpleasant and very pleasant). In the event that raters 
190 
found any of the samples too weak to assess, they were asked to select “I cannot smell the sample” 
191 
instead of using the rating scales; these samples were not included in further analysis. The ratings 
192 
were written down immediately after sniffing each stimulus, but the time spent sniffing was not 
193 
restricted.  
194 
Statistical analysis 
195 
Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests showed normal data distribution in all of the three studies. We 
196 
computed mean odour ratings for both of the tested conditions (garlic and non-garlic). The odour 
197 
samples might undergo further changes during the rating session. To test for this potentially 
198 
confounding variable, we split the ratings assessed during the first and second half of the session 
199 
and entered this variable into the analysis (e.g., in study 1, ratings made by raters 1 - 7 were 
200 
compared to ratings by raters 8 – 14). As our design was within-subjects, the mean ratings were 
201 
subsequently compared using repeated-measures ANOVA with the time of day as a between-
202 
subject factor (entered as a binominal variable). The data were analysed using mean subjects 
203 
(raters) ratings as the unit of analysis to test possible changes in the perception of axillary odour 
204 
sampled under different conditions. Each study was then analysed separately. Note that although 
205 
raters, rather than donors, were used as the unit of analysis, the ratings explicitly incorporated a 
206 
comparison between pairs of odour samples from the same donors. Our experimental design and 
207 
analytical approach therefore produces results that should be generalizable across donors, while 
208 
controlling for individual variability of rater’s olfactory perception. The statistical package SPSS 
209 
v.20 was used for all testing.

Results 
212 
Table 1 shows descriptive statistics for each rated variable, including mean scores (and SD), the 
213 
total number of ratings, and the number of analyzed ratings after exclusion of samples that were 
214 
judged to be too weak to be detected by some raters. In study 1, we found no significant differences 
215 
between experimental (garlic) and control conditions (non-garlic) for ratings of pleasantness (F(1, 
216 
12)=0.466, p=0.508, ŋ2=0.037), attractiveness (F(1, 12)=1.135, p=0.308, ŋ2=0.086), masculinity (F(1, 
217 
12)=0.414, p=0.532, ŋ2=0.033) and intensity (F(1, 12)=0.182, p=0.677, ŋ2=0.015), with no significant 
218 
effect of time of day on pleasantness (F(1, 12)=3.582, p=0.083, ŋ2=0.230), attractiveness (F(1, 
219 
12)=2.997, p=0.109, ŋ2=0.200), masculinity (F(1, 12)=2.973, p=0.110, ŋ2=0.199) and intensity (F(1, 
220 
12)=2.186, p=0.165, ŋ2=0.154) ratings with raters as the unit of analysis.

When garlic dosage was increased in study 2, odour of donors in the experimental (garlic) condition 
226 
was judged as significantly more pleasant (F(1, 38)=13.115, p=0.001, ŋ2=0.257), attractive (F(1, 
227 
38)=6.006, p=0.019, ŋ2=0.136), masculine (F(1, 38)=8.685, p=0.005, ŋ2=0.186) and less intense (F(1, 
228 
38)=10.615, p=0.002, ŋ2=0.218) compared to control conditions (Fig. 1), with no significant effect of 
229 
time of day on pleasantness (F(1, 38)=0.249, p=0.621, ŋ2=0.007), attractiveness (F(1, 38)=0.093, 
230 
p=0.762, ŋ2=0.002), masculinity (F(1, 38)=0.664, p=0.420, ŋ2=0.017) and intensity (F(1, 38)=0.054,

Most of the significant effects of garlic consumption found in study 2 were confirmed in study 3. 
241 
Specifically, we found significant differences in the ratings of attractiveness (F(1, 26)=7.638, 
242 
p=0.010, ŋ2=0.227), masculinity (F(1, 26)=4.269, p=0.049, ŋ2=0.141) and intensity (F(1, 26)=14.930, 
243 
p=0.001, ŋ2=0.365), but not in the ratings of pleasantness (F(1, 26)=0.355, p=0.557, ŋ2=0.013) (Fig. 
244 
2). Again, no significant effect of time of day was found for ratings of pleasantness (F(1, 26)=0.253, 
245 
p=0.619, ŋ2=0.010), attractiveness (F(1, 26)=0.295, p=0.592, ŋ2=0.011) and intensity (F(1, 26)=3.297, 
246 
p=0.058, ŋ2=0.131), although the differences were significant for masculinity ratings: masculinity 
247 
was rated lower during the first half of the session (F(1, 26)=7.676, p=0.010, ŋ2=0.228).

The relationships between mean scores for odour donors on the different rated variables were 
256 
analyzed by Pearson´s correlations  (Supplementary tables 2, 3, and 4); we did this separately for 
257 
the garlic and non-garlic conditions. In all three studies, we found very strong positive correlations 
258 
between pleasantness and attractiveness ratings (r’s = 0.97 - 0.99), and very strong negative 
259 
correlations between pleasantness and intensity (r’s = -0.74 – -0.93) and between attractiveness and 
260 
intensity (r’s = -0.74 – -0.94). Masculinity ratings were positively related to intensity (r’s = 0.1 – 
261 
0.89) and negatively related to both pleasantness (r’s = -0.39 – -0.89) and attractiveness (r’s = -0.27 
262 
– -0.87).

Discussion 
265 
The main aim of this study was to test whether garlic consumption affects human axillary odour. In 
266 
study 1, we found no significant effect of consumption of 6g of crushed garlic (approximately 2 
267 
cloves of fresh garlic) on perceived quality of axillary odour. To test whether this might be due to 
268 
insufficient dosing, we doubled the dose of consumed garlic in study 2. As predicted, we then found 
269 
a significant influence of garlic consumption on axillary odour, although unexpectedly we found 
270 
that odour collected after consumption of the garlic was rated as more pleasant rather than less 
271 
pleasant, and less (rather than more) intense. The robustness of these findings was subsequently 
272 
confirmed in study 3, with the use of garlic capsules instead of raw garlic.  
273 
Effects of garlic on axillary odour 
274 
Our results showing that consumption of garlic affects quality of axillary odour are consistent with 
275 
previous studies testing the influence of garlic consumption on quality of human breast milk and 
276 
amniotic fluid. It was observed, for instance, that infants attached to the breast for longer periods of 
277 
time, and consumed more milk, when the mother consumed garlic capsules (Mennella & 
278 
Beauchamp, 1991). Interestingly, the authors interpreted the increase in suckling behaviour either in 
279 
terms of prior experience with this flavour during pregnancy and early months of lactation, or in 
280 
terms of response to a novel odour (Mennella & Beauchamp, 1993). However, our findings suggest 
281 
an alternative explanation: garlic may have improved the odour and flavour of breast milk for 
282 
infants in a similar way as occurred in our study with axillary odour. Indeed, when adult panellists 
283 
rated the odour of breast milk (Mennella & Beauchamp, 1991) and amniotic fluid (Mennella & 
284 
Beauchamp, 1993), samples collected after ingestion of garlic capsules were rated as more intense 
285 
and smelling like garlic. Due to the experimental protocol, which did not differentiate the two 
286 
different qualities (intensity and garlic odour), it is not entirely clear whether the odours were 
287 
 13 
 
actually more intense or the panellists really smelled the garlic odour. Moreover, blinded conditions 
288 
were not met as the panellists were asked to indicate which samples smelled “more like garlic” and 
289 
therefore could be influenced by expectations of garlic odour. In contrast, our experimental design 
290 
followed a double-blinded protocol and neither raters nor experimenters were aware, at time of 
291 
testing, the condition under which the individual samples were collected. Our raters were aware that 
292 
were rating male body odour samples. One might argue that such specific knowledge could skew 
293 
the ratings (e.g. positively for pleasantness, negatively for attractiveness), thus creating floor or 
294 
ceiling effects which would in turn decrease the likelihood of finding significant differences. 
295 
However, visual inspection of the data distribution and significant results suggest that this was not 
296 
the case here, and such knowledge of the nature of the odour stimuli is not unusual in odour rating 
297 
studies. 
298 
Several compounds responsible for garlic´s specific aroma have been identified. When garlic is 
299 
chopped or crushed, the clove’s membrane disrupts and odorless allin (S-allylcysteine sulfoxide) is 
300 
transformed into allicin (diallyl thiosulfinate) by action of the enzyme allinase (C-S liase) (Block, 
301 
1985). The main components of the volatile oil are sulfur compounds, especially allicin, which are 
302 
responsible for the typical odour of garlic. However, allicin is unstable and converts readily into 
303 
mono-, di- and trisulfides, and other compounds such as ajoene and vinyldithiines (Shukla & Kalra, 
304 
2007). It therefore seems that allicin itself cannot be responsible for garlic’s biological activity but 
305 
is an intermediate product on the metabolic pathway towards other biologically important sulfur 
306 
compounds (Iciek et al., 2009). Obviously, garlic negatively influences the individuals´ breath on 
307 
account of sulphur containing gases which does not seem to apply to the body odour. The 
308 
compounds contributing to garlic odour might not reach the skin glands in perceptible quantities, 
309 
because the sulphurous constituents are highly volatile and many leave the body through the mouth 
310 
(Suarez et al., 1999). This is attributable to the lack of gut and liver metabolism of this gas or to 
311 
rapid metabolism of the other gases. It was therefore concluded that breath odour after garlic 
312 
ingestion initially originates from the mouth and subsequently from the gut (Suarez et al., 1999).  
313 
One might question whether or not our experimental design allowed chemicals from garlic 
314 
sufficient time to manifest its effects. It was recently shown that initial levels of volatiles released 
315 
from the breath decrease about 4 hours after garlic consumption. Initial levels are assumed to be 
316 
volatiles released from the stomach. However, a second peak of an increase of the volatiles was 
317 
observed about 6 hours and it is thought that these compounds are being released from the blood 
318 
(Rosen et al., 2000). Such a time period approximately corresponds to half of our sampling time, 
319 
and implies our odour sampling procedure allowed sufficient time for odour to emerge at the 
320 
 14 
 
axillary region. In study 2, we found an increase in pleasantness and attractiveness ratings after 
321 
garlic consumption, while in study 3 this effect was observed only for attractiveness ratings. The 
322 
slightly different outcomes between study 2 and study 3 could be ascribed to the somewhat different 
323 
nature of the stimuli (fresh garlic versus garlic capsules with soybean oil). Soybean oil could deliver 
324 
only the fat soluble fractions of the garlic extract, while fresh garlic could also contain the water 
325 
soluble fractions. Thus, some of the substances responsible for the increase in pleasantness might 
326 
not have been released after the use of soybean oil in study 3. 
327 
 
328 
 
329 
Health benefits associated with garlic consumption 
330 
At face value, our results appear counterintuitive as several previous studies reported participants’ 
331 
complaints about unpleasant breath and body odour after garlic ingestion (Borrelli et al., 2007; 
332 
Staba et al., 2001; Stevinson et al., 2001). However, the observed positive effect on hedonic quality 
333 
of axillary odour could be attributed to its well-established health benefits which involve several 
334 
major domains: i) antioxidant, ii) immunostimulant, iii) cardiovascular, iv) bactericidal, and v) 
335 
oncological effects (we review these factors below).  
336 
Several studies reported that garlic consumption significantly increases the antioxidant activity of 
337 
cells (Banerjee et al., 2002; Wei & Lau, 1998). It presumably reduces reactive oxygen species (e. g., 
338 
superoxide anion, hydroxyl radical, hydrogen peroxide) or interacts with them to protect vascular 
339 
endothelial cells from oxidant injury (Amagase, 2006). The antioxidant activity is exerted by 
340 
scavenging free radicals, enhancing antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase, catalase and 
341 
glutathione peroxidase, and increasing levels of cellular glutathione. These mechanisms may play a 
342 
role in the cardiovascular, antineoplastic, and cognitive effects of garlic (Banerjee et al., 2002).  
343 
Immune responses are influenced by various intrinsic and extrinsic factors, but diet plays a crucial 
344 
role in regulation and proper functionality of immune system. Garlic consumption stimulates 
345 
proliferation of lymphocytes, macrophage phagocytosis, enhances activities of lymphokine-
346 
activated killer cells (Amagase et al., 2001) and bone-marrow cellularity. Consumption of garlic 
347 
results in stimulated synthesis of nitric oxide (NO) and, in turn, interferon-α (IFN- α), which could 
348 
be beneficial in viral or proliferative diseases (Bhattacharyya, Girish, Karmohapatra, Samad, & 
349 
Sinha, 2007). Consumption of garlic also protects against suppression of immunity by 
350 
chemotherapy and UV radiation (Lamm & Riggs, 2001).  
351 
Garlic has been also shown to have significant effect on the cardiovascular system. Such areas 
352 
include platelet aggregation inhibition through suppression of thromboxane production (Srivastava 
353 
 15 
 
& Tyagi, 1993), antioxidant effects and decrease in fibrinolytic activity (Butt, Sultan, Butt, & Iqbal, 
354 
2009), and antihypertensive effects (Ried et al., 2008), perhaps due to its influence on plasma lipid 
355 
metabolism. Garlic decreases total serum cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol and 
356 
triglycerides (Qureshi et al., 1983) and enhances the ratio of high density lipoproteins to low density 
357 
lipoproteins (Kamanna & Chandrasekhara, 1982), and could therefore be a valuable component of 
358 
atherosclerosis-preventing diet (Gonen et al., 2005).  
359 
Garlic is further known to have inhibitory activity on various pathogenic bacteria, viruses and fungi. 
360 
It is active against proliferation of many Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, including 
361 
Escherichia, Salmonella, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Klebsiella, Proteus, Bacillus, Clostridium, 
362 
and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Even some bacteria resistant to antibiotics, such as methicillin-
363 
resistant Staphylococcus aureus, multidrug-resistant strains of Escherichia coli, Enterococcus spp., 
364 
and Shigella spp. were found to be sensitive to garlic (Ankri & Mirelman, 1999). Allicin and ajoene 
365 
appears to be the main chemicals responsible for these wide-spectrum antimicrobial effects due to 
366 
the multiple inhibitory effects they have on various thiol-dependent enzymatic systems. Studies also 
367 
suggest that garlic has an antifungal effect and antiviral activity against several viruses including 
368 
cytomegalovirus, influenza B, Herpes simplex virus, and human rhinovirus (Ankri & Mirelman, 
369 
1999). There are several possible mechanisms for these properties, including decreasing oxygen 
370 
uptake by bacteria and viruses, reducing their growth, inhibiting their synthesis of lipids, proteins 
371 
and nucleic acids, and causing membrane damage (Harris, Cottrell, Plummer, & Lloyd, 2001). 
372 
Several epidemiological studies have revealed associations between garlic consumption and lower 
373 
risk of acquisition or death from stomach cancer (Mei et al., 1982). It has been shown that garlic 
374 
consumed either in food or as a food supplement is effective against prostate cancer (Hsing et al., 
375 
2002; Key, Silcocks, Davey, Appleby, & Bishop, 1997) and decreases risk of cancer of the larynx 
376 
(Zheng et al., 1992) and esophagus (Yu et al., 2005), and of lung (Wu, Kassie, & Mersch-
377 
Sundermann, 2005) and gastric and colon cancer (Steinmetz et al., 1994). Although the precise 
378 
mechanism of this anti-carcinogenic efficacy of garlic is still unknown, several hypotheses have 
379 
been proposed: antioxidant action, inhibition of mutagenesis by inhibiting the metabolism, 
380 
inhibition of DNA adduct formation, antibacterial properties, antiproliferating activities (Shukla & 
381 
Kalra, 2007), inhibition of carcinogen activation, induction of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest, and 
382 
modulation signal transduction (Iciek et al., 2009).   
383 
 
384 
 16 
 
Health benefits could lead to increased odour pleasantness 
385 
The health effects of garlic consumption may also be responsible for our findings. Garlic ingestion 
386 
could affect axillary odour indirectly through the antioxidant properties documented in previous 
387 
studies. Sulphur-containing compounds from garlic are known to protect endothelial vascular cells 
388 
and vessels against oxidative stress (Borek, 2001) which is caused by highly reactive oxygen 
389 
molecules and may therefore play a significant role in the defence against free radical-mediated 
390 
disorders (Wei & Lau, 1998). Although the precise mechanism of this effect is still debated, garlic 
391 
could either decrease or prevent production of the reactive molecules and/or their metabolites. 
392 
Furthermore, garlic is known to enhance levels of three antioxidant enzymes: superoxide dismutase, 
393 
catalase and glutathione peroxidase, which destroy toxic peroxides, and other reactive molecules 
394 
including glutathione (Borek, 2001). Changes in levels of these molecules, their metabolites or 
395 
other oxidative stress related compounds might affect quality of the axillary odour.  
396 
Another possible mechanism for how garlic indirectly affects axillary odour is via its antibacterial 
397 
action. The main sources of axillary odour are compounds produced by apocrine glands (Beier, 
398 
Ginez, & Schaller, 2005). However, fresh secretion of these glands is practically odourless (Shelley, 
399 
Hurley, & Nichols, 1953); characteristic axillary odour consequently originates from the metabolic 
400 
activity of skin bacteria (e. g., Gram-positive bacteria: Propionibacterium, Staphylococcus, 
401 
Micrococcus, Corynebacterium, Acinetobacter, Malassezia) (Bojar & Holland, 2002). It is 
402 
conceivable that consumption of garlic might reduce density of bacterial microflora either in 
403 
general or strain-specific fashion. As a consequence, this might lead to decreasing armpit odour 
404 
intensity. It is further known that perceived odour intensity is negatively linked to its pleasantness 
405 
and attractiveness (Doty, 1981; Havlicek, Dvorakova, Bartos, & Flegr, 2006). This would explain 
406 
not only the effect of lower odour intensity, but also the inverse effect of higher pleasantness and 
407 
attractiveness odour ratings following garlic consumption. 
408 
From an evolutionary perspective, formation of preferences for diet-associated body odours was 
409 
possibly shaped by means of sexual selection (Fialová, Roberts, & Havlíček, 2013). Previous 
410 
research indicates that many animal species use diet-associated cues to select mates in good 
411 
physical condition. For example, it was shown that secondary sexual displays reveal individual 
412 
quality of potential mates via links between foraging success or diet and phenotypic characteristics 
413 
such as diet-dependent coloration and odour quality (Ferkin, Sorokin, Johnston, & Lee, 1997; 
414 
Walls, Mathis, Jaeger, & Gergits, 1989). With regard to food quantity, food deprivation in meadow 
415 
voles results in decreasing odour attractiveness for opposite sex conspecifics, but odour 
416 
attractiveness is restored after re-feeding (Pierce & Ferkin, 2005). As the health benefits of garlic 
417 
 17 
 
consumption include antioxidant, immunostimulant, cardiovascular, bactericidal, and anti-
418 
carcinogenic effects (Butt et al., 2009), it is plausible that human odour preferences have been 
419 
similarly shaped by sexual selection. This idea is consistent with a study by Olsson et al. (2014), 
420 
who showed that innate immune activation induced by injection of an endotoxin is detectable by 
421 
other individuals through more aversive body odour (Olsson et al., 2014). 
422 
 
423 
Conclusion 
424 
Our study shows that axillary odour, in contrast to oral odour, is positively affected by garlic, and 
425 
these two sources of odour should be strictly differentiated. One may thus speculate on the relative 
426 
strength and salience of these effects in social interactions. Certainly, breath odour plays a crucial 
427 
role in most social interactions, but human axillary odour is also an important factor in intimate 
428 
relationships (Havlicek et al., 2008), although these odour sources are surely interrelated. Future 
429 
studies may thus try to disentangle relative contribution of these two effects. Furthermore, our 
430 
suggestions concerning the exact mechanism by which garlic consumption may shape axillary body 
431 
odour is speculative and future studies should determine possible differences in axillary secretion 
432 
related to garlic consumption and aim to identify specific compounds responsible for possible 
433 
differences in axillary microflora. Another area which deserves further attention includes 
434 
physiological processes following garlic consumption, metabolism of particular compounds and 
435 
subsequent action in body tissues. Our data thus add an additional line of evidence for wide-spread 
436 
health effects of garlic consumption.
