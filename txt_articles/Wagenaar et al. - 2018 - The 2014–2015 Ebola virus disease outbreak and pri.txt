Abstract
Background
The aim of this study is to estimate the immediate and lasting effects of the 2014–2015
Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak on public-sector primary healthcare delivery in Liberia
using 7 years of comprehensive routine health information system data.
Methods and findings
We analyzed 10 key primary healthcare indicators before, during, and after the EVD out-
break using 31,836 facility-month service outputs from 1 January 2010 to 31 December
2016 across a census of 379 public-sector health facilities in Liberia (excluding Montserrado
County). All indicators had statistically significant decreases during the first 4 months of the
EVD outbreak, with all indicators having their lowest raw mean outputs in August 2014.
Decreases in outputs comparing the end of the initial EVD period (September 2014) to May
2014 (pre-EVD) ranged in magnitude from a 67.3% decrease in measles vaccinations (95%
CI: −77.9%, −56.8%, p < 0.001) and a 61.4% decrease in artemisinin-based combination
therapy (ACT) treatments for malaria (95% CI: −69.0%, −53.8%, p < 0.001) to a 35.2%
decrease in first antenatal care (ANC) visits (95% CI: −45.8%, −24.7%, p < 0.001) and a
38.5% decrease in medroxyprogesterone acetate doses (95% CI: −47.6%, −29.5%, p <
0.001). Following the nadir of system outputs in August 2014, all indicators showed statisti-
cally significant increases from October 2014 to December 2014. All indicators had signifi-
cant positive trends during the post-EVD period, with every system output exceeding pre-
Ebola forecasted trends for 3 consecutive months by November 2016. Health system out-
puts lost during and after the EVD outbreak were large and sustained for most indicators.
Prior to exceeding pre-EVD forecasted trends for 3 months, we estimate statistically signifi-
cant cumulative losses of −776,110 clinic visits (95% CI: −1,480,896, −101,357, p = 0.030);
−24,449 bacille Calmette–Gue
´rin vaccinations (95% CI: −45,947, −2,020, p = 0.032);

 −9,129 measles vaccinations (95% CI: −12,312, −5,659, p < 0.001); −17,191 postnatal care
(PNC) visits within 6 weeks of birth (95% CI: −28,344, −5,775, p = 0.002); and −101,857
ACT malaria treatments (95% CI: −205,839, −2,139, p = 0.044) due to the EVD outbreak.
Other outputs showed statistically significant cumulative losses only through December
2014, including losses of −12,941 first pentavalent vaccinations (95% CI: −20,309, −5,527,
p = 0.002); −5,122 institutional births (95% CI: −8,767, −1,234, p = 0.003); and −45,024
acute respiratory infections treated (95% CI: −66,185, −24,019, p < 0.001). Compared to
pre-EVD forecasted trends, medroxyprogesterone acetate doses and first ANC visits did
not show statistically significant net losses. ACT treatment for malaria was the only indicator
with an estimated net increase in system outputs through December 2016, showing an
excess of +78,583 outputs (95% CI: −309,417, +450,661, p = 0.634) compared to pre-EVD
forecasted trends, although this increase was not statistically significant. However, compar-
ing December 2013 to December 2017, ACT malaria cases have increased 49.2% (95% CI:
33.9%, 64.5%, p < 0.001). Compared to pre-EVD forecasted trends, there remains a statisti-
cally significant loss of −15,144 PNC visits within 6 weeks (95% CI: −29,453, −787, p =
0.040) through December 2016.
Conclusions
The Liberian public-sector primary healthcare system has made strides towards recovery
from the 2014–2015 EVD outbreak. All primary healthcare indicators tracked have recov-
ered to pre-EVD levels as of November 2016. Yet, for most indicators, it took more than 1
year to recover to pre-EVD levels. During this time, large losses of essential primary health-
care services occurred compared to what would have been expected had the EVD outbreak
not occurred. The disruption of malaria case management during the EVD outbreak may
have resulted in increased malaria cases. Large and sustained investments in public-sector
primary care health system strengthening are urgently needed for EVD-affected countries.
Author summary
Why was this study done?
• Almost 2 years after the final case of Ebola virus disease (EVD) was discharged in Libe-
ria, it is essential to understand the lingering effects of the EVD outbreak on the public-
sector primary healthcare system.
• Existing studies of the effects of the EVD outbreak on population health and health sys-
tem functioning have relied on small survey samples, mathematical modeling
approaches, and data collected at single points in time before, during, or immediately
after the epidemic rather than using health system output data to understand long-term
system trends.
• We aimed to improve on these limitations and extend existing analyses to cover a census
of health facilities in Liberia (excluding Montserrado County) from January 2010 to
December 2016.

 What did the authors do and find?
• We used health facility data across a census of facilities and over an 84-month period to
analyze changes in essential primary healthcare service indicators during and after the
EVD outbreak.
• We found that it took only 4 months (June–September 2014) to lose between 35% and
67% of essential primary care health system outputs across Liberian clinics, and that, as
of November 2016 (19 months post-EVD), all health system indicators had recovered to
their pre-EVD levels.
• Given that health system outputs are time-limited, the loss of an estimated 776,110 clinic
visits, 24,449 bacille Calmette–Gue
´rin vaccinations, 9,129 measles vaccinations, 12,941
first pentavalent vaccinations, 5,122 institutional births, 17,191 postnatal care visits
within 6 weeks of birth, 101,857 artemisinin-based combination therapy treatments for
malaria, and 45,024 treatments of acute respiratory infections due to the EVD outbreak
will continue to severely affect population health.
• We estimate that the number of malaria cases treated has increased by 49% from
December 2013 to December 2016—a finding potentially due to increases in the trans-
mission of the disease following large-scale treatment interruptions during the EVD
outbreak.
What do these findings mean?
• These findings add to the body of literature suggesting that the 2014–2015 EVD out-
break across West Africa had devastating effects on the delivery of all types of public-
sector primary healthcare services.
• For most primary healthcare indicators, it took more than 1 year post-EVD to recover
to pre-EVD levels, with net losses persisting as of December 2016.
• Malaria cases may have increased since the EVD outbreak in Liberia, as predicted from
previous modelling efforts across EVD-affected countries; the extent to which a similar
trend for malaria has been recorded in Sierra Leone or Guinea is not clear.
• Public-sector primary healthcare system strengthening is urgently needed across West
Africa, with specific focus targeted to general outpatient care, childhood vaccination,
maternal health, and malaria prevention/treatment.
Introduction
The 2014–2015 Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak across West Africa represented an interna-
tional tragedy, directly leading to 28,616 cases of EVD and 11,310 deaths in total, and 10,675
confirmed, probable, and suspected cases in Liberia, resulting in 4,809 deaths [1]. Due to
already weakened health systems, the EVD outbreak led to incredible disruption in the contin-
ued provision of life-saving public-sector primary healthcare across Sierra Leone, Guinea, and
Liberia—the 3 countries most severely impacted by the epidemic [2]. Analyses using routine
health information system (RHIS) data originating from Guinea and Sierra Leone have

 recently chronicled the effect of the EVD epidemic on the delivery of public-sector care for
maternal, child, and reproductive health services, showing dramatic decreases during the
Ebola outbreak (on the order of 50% declines) and sustained low levels not suggesting recovery
[3–5]. Previous descriptive studies using RHIS data from Liberia have shown decreases in
maternal and child health (MCH) indicators [6,7], malaria treatment [8], HIV testing [9], and
tuberculosis diagnoses [10] during the EVD outbreak. Others have estimated that EVD-related
disruptions in treating malaria alone will contribute to significantly more excess deaths than
direct EVD-related mortality [11]. Mathematical modeling of malaria in Liberia has estimated
that the disruption of treatment due to EVD will result in 520,000 untreated malaria cases,
57,200 new malaria cases that would not have occurred otherwise, and a 62% increase in
malaria-attributable mortality [12]. Other modeling approaches have suggested that EVD-
related deaths may significantly decrease life expectancy across Sierra Leone, Liberia, and
Guinea [13]—not to mention collateral morbidity and mortality due to the disruption of these
countries’ health systems. The majority of existing studies on the effects of the EVD outbreak
on the delivery of primary healthcare have used survey sampling data or mathematical model-
ing methods [14–30].
Now, almost 2 years after the final case of EVD was discharged in Liberia, it is essential to
understand the lingering effects of the EVD outbreak on the public-sector health system. Trag-
ically, one of the most enduring legacies of this global health emergency was the death of health
workers. Liberia lost 184 doctors, nurses, and midwives due to EVD—a loss of 8% of the
nationwide total—leaving Liberia with only 2.1 doctors, nurses, and midwives per 10,000 pop-
ulation; this density ranks as one of the lowest in the world and is far below the minimum
World Health Organization standard of 23 per 10,000 [31]. While there have been a significant
number of studies examining the effect of the EVD outbreak on health systems, including a
number from Liberia, the majority have had significant limitations, including the following:
(1) analyzing a small sub-sample of health facilities in select districts; (2) using only 1 year of
data to populate pre-EVD and/or post-EVD trends; (3) analyzing data at an aggregate district,
provincial, or national level rather than at the facility level; (4) using strict linear time trends
rather than more flexible functional forms; (5) using statistical methods that fail to account for
data clustering, seasonality, or autocorrelation; (6) a lack of forecasting to examine the impact
of the EVD outbreak versus a counterfactual; and (7) focusing on only 1 small subset of pri-
mary healthcare indicators in a given analysis.
The aim of the present study is to extend previous research estimating the effects of the
EVD outbreak on health system outputs by analyzing monthly facility-level system outputs for
7 years across 10 key primary healthcare indicators in a census of public-sector health facilities
in Liberia, excluding Montserrado County. We additionally aim to use more than 4 years of
pre-EVD data to generate accurate forecasts, allowing estimation of lost system outputs due to
the EVD outbreak in Liberia to aid in future targeting of health system strengthening.
Methods
Ethics statement
This paper was approved by the Liberian Ministry of Health (MoH) and used existing RHIS
data that do not qualify as human subjects research.
Data sources and outcomes
The primary outcome was monthly facility-level time-series data abstracted from the Liberian
MoH RHIS, which is integrated with District Health Information Software 2 (DHIS 2) open-
source software. We abstracted all available data from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2016

 across indicators and health facilities nationwide, with the exception of facilities in Montser-
rado County, which houses the capital of Monrovia (see S1 Fig for the county structure of
Liberia). We excluded health facilities in Montserrado County for 2 reasons. First, Montser-
rado County has unique sociodemographic characteristics compared to the rest of Liberia in
that 85% of its population is in the fourth or highest wealth quintile, compared to only 14% in
these quintiles averaging across all other counties nationwide [32]. Second, and more pertinent
to the present analyses, there exist numerous for-profit, religious, and not-for-profit clinics
and pharmacies operating in Montserrado County, which do not report to the MoH and thus
would not be captured in these analyses. This contrasts to the other 14 counties nationwide,
where few private clinics exist, and the vast majority of care is provided by public-sector clinics
reporting through the national RHIS. Our analyses included the following indicators: (1) clinic
visits; (2) bacille Calmette–Gue
´rin (BCG) vaccinations; (3) measles vaccinations; (4) first pen-
tavalent vaccinations; (5) first antenatal care (ANC) visits; (6) institutional births; (7) postnatal
care (PNC) visits within 6 weeks of birth; (8) artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT)
treatments for malaria; (9) acute respiratory infections (ARIs) treated; and (10) medroxypro-
gesterone acetate doses. These indicators were selected from DHIS 2 as they represent key out-
puts for the effective delivery of primary healthcare across Liberia that have not changed in
definition and data collection procedures during the time period of interest (2010–2016). PNC
visits within 6 weeks and ARIs treated were analyzed beginning 1 January 2012 due to incon-
sistent reporting in the MoH system prior to this time.
Statistical analyses and data cleaning
The specific hypotheses we intended to test were as follows: (1) Did the EVD outbreak lead to
statistically significant reductions in primary healthcare outputs? (2) What is the magnitude of
lost primary healthcare outputs compared to pre-EVD forecasted trends, and how do these
reductions differ by primary care indicator? (3) Have primary healthcare outputs recovered to
pre-EVD levels as of December 2016? (4) What is the magnitude of recovery of primary health-
care outputs, and how does this differ by primary care indicator?
Our a priori analysis plan included (1) data cleaning and outlier identification using indi-
vidual facility-level local regression analyses over time; (2) initial univariate analyses of indica-
tors over time to determine functional forms for model parameterization; (3) analyses of the
effect of the EVD outbreak on each indicator; and (4) forecasts to determine estimates of lost
health system outputs due to the EVD outbreak.
Initial data abstraction identified 379 public-sector MoH facilities reporting through the
DHIS 2 system from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2016 across all counties excluding Mon-
tserrado County. Individual facility-level local regression analyses were conducted, with outli-
ers identified and set to missing if they exceeded 8 standard deviations from the mean time
trend. Measles vaccination was excluded from facility-level local regression outlier analyses
due to a measles campaign during the Ebola outbreak that led to informative data that would
have been incorrectly tagged as outliers by outlier analysis. Facilities were excluded from analy-
ses if they failed to report at least 12 monthly observations over the 7-year period for a given
indicator. After observing large facility-level heterogeneity in intercepts, as well as trends over
time, we employed mixed-effects models with random intercepts for facility and random
slopes over time (see equation below).

 where Indicatorit represents 1 of 10 key primary healthcare system outputs included in this
study (e.g., clinic visits); subscripts i, y, and t indicate a health facility i (running from 1 to 379)
in calendar year y (running from 1 to 7) and at month t (running from 1 to 84); β0i represents
the model intercept with both a fixed effect and facility-level random effects; Splineyt indexes
time within calendar year y at month t (these linear splines include fixed effects and random
effects by facility); Month is an individual dummy variable indexing month of the year using
the month of January as the reference category; Catchmentit is the catchment population for
health facility i at month t; Ebola1 counts the months since the beginning of the Ebola out-
break in June 2014; Ebola2 counts the months since October 2014; and AfterEbola counts the
months since the end of the Ebola outbreak in May 2015.
Since RHIS data are facility-level counts, our initial a priori analysis plan was to use Poisson
or negative binomial models with health facility catchment population as an offset term. How-
ever, the final model we employed was a linear mixed-effects model with a normal residual dis-
tribution. We used a linear mixed-effects model for 3 reasons. First, attempts to run these
complex models (>25,000 observations; 8 random effects) as Poisson models failed to con-
verge without simplifications such as the elimination of facility-level random slopes and the
elimination of an AR(1) structure for autocorrelation in residual errors. Second, a linear
mixed model converged and resulted in a stable model with approximately normal residual
errors and best linear unbiased predictors (predicted random effects). Third, using linear mod-
els allows the intuitive interpretation of absolute differences in health facility outputs over
time, rather than ratios of rates on a multiplicative scale, as one would receive from a Poisson
model, which are often less easy to interpret by policymakers and implementers.
After initial univariate analyses of indicators over time, we modeled the time effect using
yearly splines, and the effect of Ebola was modeled using a segmented regression parameteriza-
tion with pre-EVD trends (1 January 2010–31 May 2014), trends for the first 4 months of the
EVD outbreak (1 June 2014–30 September 2014), trends for the middle 3 months of the EVD
outbreak (1 October 2014–31 December 2014), trends for the last 4 months of the EVD out-
break (1 January 2015–30 April 2015), and post-Ebola trends (1 May 2015–31 December 2016).
Due to large observed seasonal effects, we included fixed-effect monthly indicator variables in
all models. An AR(1) structure was used to account for autocorrelation in residual errors. To
control for clinic-level catchment population, we included a fixed effect of facility-level catch-
ment population, which aids in explaining some of the non-random natural heterogeneity of
health facilities. Missing data were accounted for in the mixed-effects models using standard
maximum likelihood estimation. In order to develop forecasts, we reran the abovementioned
mixed-effects linear models to extend pre-EVD trends through December 2016 as a “counter-
factual” to the observed EVD outbreak. We simulated 1,000 predictions per month under each
model (full and counterfactual) using the coefficients and covariance matrix of the fixed parts of
each model using a multivariate normal distribution [33]. Lost health system outputs were com-
puted as the differences between the mean simulated values under the full model and the fore-
casted (counterfactual) model. To compute 95% confidence intervals around these differences,
we used the range from the percentiles 2.5 and 97.5 of simulated values. p-Values were calcu-
lated as the smaller of the proportion of simulated values falling either above or below zero. This
value was then multiplied by 2 to represent a 2-sided p-value. All analyses were conducted using
Stata 15 and a 2-sided alpha value of 0.05 (see S1 Text for Stata do file).
Results
Across the 379 clinics and the 31,836 clinic-months in the analyses, the mean clinic-level
catchment population was 6,912 (range: 214–67,381), serving an estimated total population of

 approximately 2.6 million (Table 1). Across the 14 counties included in the analyses, there
were a total of 2,320 EVD cases, ranging from 2 cases in Grand Gedeh and River Cess to 746
cases in Lofa. Data from previous community surveys suggest that all counties except Sinoe
and Grand Kru have more than 90% of women attending at least 1 ANC visit, although on
average across all counties, only 52.7% of women deliver in a health facility (range: 34.6%–
75.6%). The average BCG coverage across counties is 89.5%, with measles coverage lower, at
70.6%. Malaria prevalence in children is high, at 34.4%.
Given that not all clinics perform, and thus report, all 10 primary care indicators, the num-
ber of facilities and facility-months included in analyses vary by indicator. Values range from
379 clinics and 31,736 clinic-months for clinic visits and ACT treatments for malaria to 275
clinics and 23,100 clinic-months for institutional births and 244 clinics and 14,640 clinic-
months for treatment of ARIs (see Table 2). The proportion of clinic-months missing also var-
ied from a low of 4.8% for outpatient clinic visits to a high of 14.3% for medroxyprogesterone

 acetate doses. The number of outliers identified through facility-level local regression analyses
ranged from 1.1% of clinic-months for BCG vaccinations and first ANC visits to a low of
0.34% for ARIs. Rates of missing data varied over time, with most indicators showing more
missing data earlier in the time series (2010–2014) compared to in later years. For some indica-
tors, there was a slight increase in missing data during the first 4 months of the EVD outbreak
(June–September 2014) compared to the 5 months just prior to the EVD outbreak (January–
May 2014); however, these increases were relatively small (clinic visits: 4.3% to 7.3%;

indicators (BCG doses: 6.4% to 6.3%; measles doses: 8.4% to 7.1%).
Pre-EVD trends (January 2010–May 2014)
Pre-EVD trends were heterogeneous by indicator. Clinic visits, first ANC visits, and ACT
malaria treatments all showed strong and consistent decreases across the pre-EVD period,
resulting in decreases in system outputs of −21.9% (95% CI: −27.6%, −16.3%, p < 0.001),
−30.8% (95% CI: −38.4%, −23.3%, p < 0.001), and −30.0% (95% CI: −39.2%, −20.8%, p <
0.001), respectively, comparing January 2010 to January 2014. Other indicators showed strong
and consistent increases, including institutional births (+91.6%; 95% CI: +61.4%, +121.9%, p <
0.001) and medroxyprogesterone acetate doses (+108.5%; 95% CI: +70.0, +146.9, p < 0.001).
Remaining indicators showed mixed trends, with some years of significant increases and some
years of significant decreases (see Tables 3–6; see Figs 1–10). Of note is that official MoH clinic
catchment populations increased an average of 8.6% from January 2011 to January 2014.
All indicators, except measles vaccinations, exhibited significant seasonal effects. Clinic vis-
its were most common in the month of June, first ANC visits were most common in January,
institutional births were most common in May, ACT malaria treatments were most common
in June, and the most ARIs were treated in October.

 Early effects of the EVD outbreak (June 2014–September 2014)
All indicators had statistically significant and clinically important decreases in system outputs
during the first 4 months of the EVD outbreak (June 2014–September 2014) (Tables 3–6; Figs
1–10). Using raw means, all indicators had their lowest system outputs in the month of August
2014. Model-fitted decreases in outputs comparing the end of the initial EVD period (Sep-
tember 2014) to May 2014 (pre-EVD) ranged in magnitude from a 67.3% decrease in measles
vaccinations (95% CI: −77.9%, −56.8%, p < 0.001) and a 61.4% decrease in ACT malaria treat-
ments (95% CI: −69.0%, −53.8%, p < 0.001) to a 35.2% decrease in first ANC visits (95% CI:
−45.8%, −24.7%, p < 0.001) and a 38.5% decrease in medroxyprogesterone acetate doses (95%
CI: −47.6%, −29.5%, p < 0.001). All remaining indicators showed decreases in system outputs
ranging from a 48.7% decrease in first pentavalent doses (95% CI: −56.0%, −41.5%, p < 0.001)
to a 61.0% decrease in ARIs treated (95% CI: −73.6%, −48.3%, p < 0.001).
System resilience during the EVD outbreak (October 2014–April 2015)
Following the nadir of system outputs in August 2014, all indicators showed statistically signifi-
cant increases from October 2014 to December 2014—beginning the recovery of health system
outputs to pre-EVD levels (Tables 3–6). By January 2015, measles vaccination had increased to
162.9% of the pre-EVD levels from January 2014 (95% CI: 144.4%, 181.3%, p < 0.001), likely

 due to targeted vaccination campaigns. Furthermore, all other indicators increased from the
nadir to a range of 107.8% of pre-EVD (January 2014) levels for ACT treatments (95% CI:
91.1%, 116.4%, p < 0.001) to 78.5% for PNC visits (95% CI: 65.9%, 91.1%, p < 0.001). Following
these initial system increases, indicators showed mixed progress over the next 4 months (Janu-
ary 2015–April 2015), with clinic visits, first ANC visits, institutional births, PNC visits, ACT
treatments for malaria, and medroxyprogesterone acetate doses showing no significant
increases. BCG and first pentavalent vaccinations also showed significant decreases during this
time period. In contrast to all other indicators, treatment for ARIs continued to significantly
increase during this time period. By May 2015, measles vaccinations normalized to 74.2% of
pre-EVD (May 2014) levels (95% CI: 64.6%, 83.8%, p < 0.001) as targeted campaigns ended.
Post-EVD trends (May 2015–December 2016)
All indicators had significant positive trends during the post-EVD period, with every system out-

 vaccinations exceeded pre-Ebola forecasted trends earliest, achieving the 3-month benchmark in
February 2015 even prior to the EVD outbreak finishing (Table 2). Other indicators notable for
their rapid recovery to pre-EVD levels included ACT treatments for malaria (recovered by May
2015), medroxyprogesterone acetate doses (recovered by November 2015), and institutional births
(recovered by December 2015). First ANC visits, PNC visits within 6 weeks, and ARIs treated did
not show significant increases during the initial 8-month period post-EVD (May–December
2015); however, all showed significant increases from January to December 2016. PNC visits and
first ANC visits took longest to recover to pre-EVD levels, achieving 3 months of output exceeding
the pre-Ebola forecast in September and November 2016, respectively.
Estimates of system outputs lost due to the EVD outbreak
Health system outputs lost due to the EVD outbreak were large and sustained for most indica-
tors. Prior to exceeding pre-EVD forecasted trends for 3 months, we estimate a cumulative
loss of −776,110 clinic visits (95% CI: −1,480,896, −101,357, p = 0.030); −24,449 BCG vaccina-
tions (95% CI: −45,947, −2,020, p = 0.032); −9,129 measles vaccinations (95% CI: −12,312,
−5,659, p < 0.001); −23,077 first pentavalent vaccinations (95% CI: −47,704, +1,706, p =
0.058); −13,189 first ANC visits (95% CI: −49,765, +23,320, p = 0.482); −7,243 institutional
births (95% CI: −15,554, +1,502, p = 0.124); −17,191 PNC visits within 6 weeks (95% CI:
−28,344, −5,775, p = 0.002); −101,857 ACT malaria treatments (95% CI: −205,839, −2,139,
p = 0.044); −54,549 ARIs treated (95% CI: −111,392, +2,264, p = 0.058); and −15,889 medroxy-
progesterone acetate doses (95% CI: −41,066, +9,314, p = 0.232) due to the EVD outbreak
(Table 2). When tabulating cumulative system losses compared to pre-EVD forecasted trends
through December 2014, all indicators except first ANC visits and medroxyprogesterone ace-
tate doses had statistically significant cumulative losses of system outputs.

 All indicators exceeded pre-EVD levels by November 2016 and showed sustained, statisti-
cally significant positive trends post-EVD. However, only ACT treatments for malaria had a
point estimate of system output change that exceeded zero compared to pre-EVD forecasted
trends through December 2016—showing an excess of +78,583 treatments (95% CI: −309,417,
+450,661, p = 0.634), although it is important to note that this confidence interval is wide and
contains zero. Comparing model-fitted ACT malaria treatments from December 2013 and
December 2016, cases significantly increased by +49.2% (95% CI: +33.9%, +64.5%, p < 0.001).
Compared to pre-EVD forecasted trends, PNC visits within 6 weeks was the only indicator
showing a statistically significant change in outputs through December 2016, showing a loss of
−15,144 PNC visits within 6 weeks (95% CI: −29,453, −787, p = 0.040). With the exception of
ACT malaria treatments, all other indicators had large negative point estimates for total change
in cumulative system outputs through December 2016, although all confidence intervals are
large and contain zero (except PNC visits within 6 weeks; Table 2).

 Discussion
To our knowledge, this study is the first analytical assessment of public-sector primary health-
care delivery before, during, and after the 2014–2015 EVD outbreak. This study uses data from
7 years of service delivery in Liberia (excluding Montserrado County) to accurately estimate
trends before, during, and after the outbreak, as well as forecast system losses attributable to
the EVD outbreak. We observed large and significant changes in the delivery of public-sector
primary healthcare across Liberia during and after the EVD outbreak. It took only 4 months to
lose between 35% and 67% of essential primary care health system outputs across Liberian
clinics after the beginning of the EVD outbreak (with the time period of the outbreak defined
as June 2014–April 2015). The Liberian health system showed early resilience during the EVD
outbreak, with all primary healthcare indicators showing increases from October to December
2014. Unlike findings from recent studies in Guinea [4], our analyses show that, through

 December 2016, primary healthcare delivery across Liberia has shown significant evidence of
recovery from the EVD outbreak. However, due to the large magnitude of health system out-
put losses during the EVD outbreak, there remain estimated net losses of tens of thousands of
key childhood vaccinations and essential MCH consultations and hundreds of thousands of
clinic visits.
In addition, the EVD outbreak appears to have reversed multiple-year trends of decreases
in the number of malaria cases. We hypothesize that the loss of over 100,000 treatments for
malaria during the EVD outbreak may have contributed to an excess of malaria cases after the
EVD outbreak, and a return to numbers of malaria cases not seen since 2011. Our analyses
suggest that malaria cases have increased by almost 50% comparing December 2013 before the
EVD outbreak to December 2016. These measurements corroborate previous mathematical
models that have hypothesized a large increase in malaria cases due to the disruption of
malaria case management in EVD-affected countries [11,12,24]. In addition to the disruption

 of acute malaria treatment, the observed increase in malaria cases may be partially attributable
to interruption of prevention activities (e.g., bednet distribution and utilization programs), as
well as an increased fraction of malaria cases being treated post-EVD compared to pre-EVD.
We found that it took 23 months after the beginning of the EVD outbreak, and 11 months
after Liberia was declared free of EVD, for health-seeking behavior to return to pre-Ebola lev-
els, leading to a cumulative loss of more than 770,000 clinic visits. This gap in primary care ser-
vice delivery lasted longer for first ANC visits, PNC visits within 6 weeks, and BCG and first
pentavalent vaccinations. While some indicators such as clinic visits, ANC visits, PNC visits,
and vaccinations may potentially be “made up” after the EVD epidemic (although deferred
care could still be detrimental), other indicators such as institutional births, treatment for epi-
sodes of malaria and ARI, and medroxyprogesterone acetate doses that are inherently time-
limited cannot be made up through increased access to care post-EVD. In the present paper,
we calculated net losses of health system outputs for all 10 primary care indicators, with the

 caveat that increased access to care for acute and time-limited indicators does not offset the
deleterious effects of gaps in treatment access during the EVD outbreak.
These findings suggest the need for the development of best practices, coordinated
responses, and larger global investments in public-sector health system strengthening efforts
when responding to future global public health emergencies [34]. The emerging evidence from
Sierra Leone [2,16,17,22], Guinea [3,4,11,15], and Liberia ([6–10] and our study) suggests that,
in terms of morbidity and mortality, the collateral effects from the EVD outbreak on public-
sector primary healthcare delivery will greatly exceed the direct effects from EVD infection.
Analyses using population-based surveys in Liberia suggest that distrust of the government
and the health system was the primary source of reduced health service demand during the
EVD outbreak, rather than supply-side factors [29]. Thus, during future health system emer-
gencies, policymakers should address demand-side factors during periods of crisis. In addi-
tion, sustained and long-term investments in public-sector health system strengthening is

 needed to ensure that EVD-affected countries have the resilience to detect, treat, and eradicate
future emerging epidemics prior to large-scale spread, all while maintaining the delivery of
life-saving public-sector primary healthcare.
Prior to the EVD outbreak, Liberia had one of the highest rates of maternal mortality in the
world, with a rate of 1,072 deaths per 100,000 live births according to the 2013 Demographic
and Health Survey (DHS) [32]—representing an 8% increase from 2007 DHS estimates [35].
Nationwide, maternal deaths are estimated to represent 38% of all deaths to women aged 15–
49 years [32]. As of 2013, community-level estimates of institutional birth coverage (56%) and
use of any modern contraceptive method (21%) remained low [32]. For these reasons, it was
positive to document the large increases in institutional births (+92%) and medroxyprogester-
one acetate doses (+109%) from 2010 to 2014 in our study. These increases are corroborated
by community survey data showing a more than 50% increase in institutional births and a
130% increase in injectable contraceptive use from 2007 to 2013 [32,35]. Given these successes,

 it is especially concerning to see the loss of 7,243 institutional births, along with gaps in other
essential MCH services (estimated losses of 13,189 first ANC visits, 17,191 PNC visits within 6
weeks, and 15,889 medroxyprogesterone acetate doses), that occurred during the EVD out-
break, all of which continue to have point estimates of net losses in system outputs through
December 2016, over 20 months post-EVD. However, it is important to note that PNC visits
within 6 weeks is the only indicator with a confidence interval of lost system outputs through
December 2016 that does not contain zero.
The loss of medroxyprogesterone acetate doses may have lasting negative impacts on MCH
across Liberia as unintended pregnancies are linked to elevated risks of low birth weight, child
malnutrition and mortality, and maternal mortality [36]. The disruption of access to long-act-
ing reversible contraception during the EVD outbreak could also partially explain the observed
increases in recorded births post-EVD [37]. The slow recovery of first ANC visits and PNC vis-
its to pre-EVD levels may warrant targeted interventions, especially considering the persistent

 gaps in PNC coverage pre-EVD [32], as well as the essential role that first ANC visits play in
the health of mother and child. Given the near universal coverage (>95%) of at least 1 ANC
visit nationwide [32], the observed decreases in first ANC visits before the EVD outbreak
could at least partially reflect declining total fertility rates [32], although we hypothesize that
the majority of this decrease is due to improved routine data management, such as better
tracking of repeat ANC visits. A recent study in the capital city of Monrovia (which was
excluded from the present analyses) showed that during the EVD outbreak, deliveries in public
clinics decreased dramatically and were substituted by a similar magnitude increase in deliver-
ies in private clinics [30].
In regards to child vaccination, prior to the EVD outbreak, reported numbers of BCG, first
pentavalent, and measles vaccinations were relatively stable, with some decreases also hypothe-
sized to be due to decreasing fertility rates. The EVD outbreak led to large losses in vaccination
outputs, leaving young children at significant risk for infection with life-threatening illnesses,

 as well as potentially putting adults at risk through the breakdown of community-level herd
immunity. Overall, we recorded significant and persistent net losses of child vaccinations that
continue to number over 20,000 for BCG, 14,000 for first pentavalent, and 3,200 for measles,
although, again, these are point estimates, and confidence intervals around these forecasts as
of December 2016 contain zero. In the short term, significant efforts should be launched across
EVD-affected countries to ensure that coverage of all essential child vaccinations reaches the
minimum levels necessary to maintain herd immunity. In the longer term, system strengthen-
ing efforts are needed to ensure that routine immunization activities can maintain high levels
of coverage in the post-EVD environment across West Africa. Our finding that it took only 7
months (June–December 2014) to accumulate more than 12,000 lost BCG vaccinations, 9,000
lost measles vaccinations, and 12,000 lost first pentavalent vaccinations suggests that during
future public health emergencies, significant and rapid efforts must be made to maintain the

 delivery of essential child vaccinations in public-sector primary care even during the most
challenging times.
Our study has several important limitations. First, due to inconsistent indicators in the
national RHIS, we were unable to include any HIV or tuberculosis data in the present analyses.
Second, Montserrado County was excluded from this study, which limits generalizability and
means that the calculated system losses due to EVD are likely an underestimate. Third, these
analyses relied on aggregate RHIS data that have not undergone systematic or large-scale data
quality audits, and thus we cannot confirm the consistency, reliability, or validity of these data.
We found some small increases in the amount of missing data during the first 4 months of the
EVD epidemic compared to the 5 months just previous to the EVD epidemic—however, there
were also some indicators that had no changes in missingness. Without knowledge of data
quality over time pre- and post-EVD, it is likely that the health system disruption during the

 EVD outbreak may have caused some bias in the effect sizes presented in this study. Future
studies could attempt to understand how the EVD outbreak affected RHIS data quality to
inform use of RHIS data to track future epidemics or health system emergencies. Fourth, our
assessment of system outputs did not quantify potential changes in the quality of care provided
before, during, and after the EVD outbreak, including disruptions in essential supplies, medi-
cines, reagents, and staff. Last, given the scope of this paper, we were unable to analyze facility-
or county-level factors that may have influenced changes in system outputs. This is an area
that could be examined in future studies.
Despite these limitations, our study has some notable strengths. We analyzed RHIS data at
the facility level, using robust statistical methods and flexible time trends to accurately estimate
the functional forms of reductions in health services due to the EVD outbreak. In addition, we
used 7 years of data across a census of all public-sector MoH facilities in Liberia outside Mon-
tserrado County, resulting in a database of over 30,000 facility-month observations. We ana-
lyzed multiple nonoverlapping essential primary healthcare indicators, all of which had
relatively low rates of missing data and limited changes in missing data patterns over the
7-year period. These analyses serve as an example of the value of RHIS data for rapidly and
effectively tracking health system performance in low- and middle-income countries [38].
In summary, there were rapid and significant disruptions to public-sector primary health-
care delivery during and immediately after the EVD outbreak in Liberia, with system losses of
36% to 67% of pre-EVD levels. The Liberian health system showed early signs of resilience dur-
ing and after the EVD outbreak, but not before accruing large gaps in essential primary care
service delivery. As of November 2016, all indicators tracked have recovered to pre-EVD levels,
although large net losses likely exist for essential childhood vaccinations, maternal health ser-
vices, and primary care visits. Due to the disruption of malaria case management during the
EVD outbreak, malaria cases have rebounded from steady decreases pre-EVD to an increasing
trend and 50% higher caseloads in December 2016 compared to December 2013. More than
20 months after Liberia was declared free of EVD, persistent gaps in public-sector health ser-
vice delivery continue due to lingering effects from the EVD outbreak. During future public
health emergencies, funding should be explicitly allocated to maintain public-sector primary
healthcare delivery and to promote recovery of systems functioning post-emergency. RHIS
data should be considered an essential tool to track future epidemics and health system emer-
gencies in real time and should receive more funding, attention, and use. Sustained invest-
ments in public-sector health system strengthening are needed across EVD-affected countries
to close gaps in primary care that occurred during the EVD outbreak, and to build resilient pri-
mary healthcare systems capable of mitigating collateral effects of the next emerging epidemic.
