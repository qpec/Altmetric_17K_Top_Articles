Background-—Alcohol consumption has been associated with atrial fibrillation (AF) in several epidemiologic studies, but the
underlying mechanisms remain unknown. We sought to test the hypothesis that an atrial myopathy, manifested by
echocardiographic left atrial enlargement, explains the association between chronic alcohol use and AF.
Methods and Results-—We evaluated the relationship between cumulative alcohol consumption and risk of incident AF in 5220
Offspring and Original Framingham Heart Study participants (mean age 56.3 years, 54% women) with echocardiographic left atrial
size measurements. The incidence of AF was 8.4 per 1000 person-years, with 1088 incident AF cases occurring over a median 6.0
years (25th–75th percentiles 4.0–8.7 years) of follow-up. After multivariable adjustment for potential confounders, every
additional 10 g of alcohol per day (just under 1 drink per day) was associated with a 0.16 mm (95% CI, 0.10–0.21 mm) larger left
atrial dimension. Also in multivariable adjusted analysis, every 10 g per day of alcohol consumed was associated with a 5% higher
risk of developing new-onset AF (hazard ratio, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.01–1.09). An estimated 24% (95% CI, 8–75) of the association
between alcohol and AF risk was explained by left atrial enlargement.
Conclusions-—Our study of a large, community-based sample identified alcohol consumption as a predictor of left atrial
enlargement and subsequent incident AF. Left atrial enlargement may be an intermediate phenotype along the causal pathway
linking long-term alcohol consumption to AF. (J Am Heart Assoc. 2016;5:e004060 doi: 10.1161/JAHA.116.004060)

A
lthough alcohol consumption has been associated with
atrial fibrillation (AF) in several large epidemiologic
studies,1–3 the responsible mechanisms remain unknown.
Previous electrophysiologic studies have failed to demon-
strate an electrical mechanism,4–7 suggesting that structural
changes in the atrium may be responsible.
Heavy alcohol consumption has long been known to result in
ventricular cardiomyopathy.8 As thesmaller atria are known to be
more prone to enlargement and fibrosis than the ventricles,9–11 it
is possible that more modest amounts of alcohol might be
associated with evidence ofatrial myopathy.However,theimpact
of cumulative alcohol exposure, especially modest alcohol
consumption, during adulthood on left atrial structure remains
largely undetermined. Furthermore, although an emerging liter-
ature provides evidence that alcohol may increase atrial size,12
studies conducted to date have not taken into account the
possible effects of interim AF. As AF itself may lead to left atrial
enlargement,13,14 it remains unknown whether the alcohol-
associated atrial enlargement represents a co-traveler, a subse-
quent effect of AF, or a key intermediate phenotype along the
causal pathway between alcohol exposure and AF.
Using data from the Framingham Heart Study (FHS), we
sought to determine whether cumulative alcohol exposure is
associated with enlargement of the left atrium in a large
ambulatory cohort prior to any ascertainment of AF and to
explorethe hypothesisthatanincreaseinleftatrialsizemediates
the association between alcohol and risk for incident AF.

 and clinical data. The Framingham Heart and Offspring
Studies, as well as their design and methods, have been
described in prior publications.9,15 In brief, participants were
evaluated by a study physician at the Heart Study facility
approximately every 4 to 8 years. At each Heart Study visit, a
physician administers a physical examination and obtains a
thorough medical history. The standard study examination
includes measurements of resting blood pressure. At the
same examination, a laboratory evaluation is performed
assessing standard risk factors, including fasting blood
glucose and lipids. For the analyses examining the relations
between alcohol and echocardiographic left atrial dimension
(LAD), we focused on Original Cohort attendees at examina-
tion cycles 2, 7, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, and 20 as well as
Offspring examination cycles 1 through 8, at which the
participants
underwent a
standardized
questionnaire
to
assess daily alcohol consumption.
Cardiovascular Disease and Risk Factor
Definitions
FHS participants prescribed an antihypertensive medication
as
well
as
those
with
either
systolic
blood
pressure
≥140 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mm Hg were
considered to have hypertension.16 Body mass index was
calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of the
participant’s height in meters (kg/m2).16 Treatment with
diabetes mellitus medications or a fasting plasma glucose
≥126 mg/dL were used to determine the presence of
diabetes mellitus.17,18 If participants reported smoking ≥1
cigarette daily during the year prior to their study examina-
tion, they were considered current smokers. If a study
physician auscultated a grade 3/6 or higher systolic murmur
or any diastolic murmur, participants were deemed to have
valvular heart disease. The criteria used by study investigators
to define myocardial infarction and heart failure are pub-
lished.9,19,20 In brief, a myocardial infarction was considered
present when 2 of 3 following findings were documented in
the medical record: (1) symptoms indicative of ischemia; (2)
changes in biomarkers of myocardial necrosis; and (3) serial
changes in ECGs indicating evolution of infarction. An old
myocardial infarction was considered to be present when the
ECG showed a stable pattern including either a pathologic Q-
wave or loss of precordial R waves. An autopsy report
showing
an
acute,
new,
or
recent
infarction
of
the
myocardium was also accepted as evidence of an incident
myocardial infarction. A diagnosis of heart failure required
that a minimum of 2 major heart failure or 1 major and 2
minor heart failure criteria be present concurrently.20 The
presence of other conditions capable of producing the symp-
toms and signs were considered in evaluating the findings.
Study participants provided written informed consent. The
Framingham Original and Offspring study protocols were
approved by the Boston University Medical Center Institu-
tional Review Board.
Assessment of Alcohol Consumption
Alcohol consumption was ascertained as part of the stan-
dardized general medical history administered to all Framing-
ham
Original
and
Offspring
Study
participants.
Three
questions were asked related to alcohol consumption during
study examinations by a study physician.1 These included,
“During the past year, how many 12-ounce bottles, cans, or
glasses of beer did you consume per week?,” “During the past
year, how many 4-ounce glasses of wine did you consume per
week?”, and “During the past year, how many cocktails (eg,
drinks containing 1–1.5 ounces of liquor) did you consume
per week?”21 In this analysis, we transformed responses to
the 3 questions above into a total quantity of alcohol
consumed per day variable (grams per day).
Echocardiographic Examinations
Each participant completed a maximum of 5 echocardio-
graphic measurements at examinations 2, 4, 5, 6, and 8
(Offspring) or examinations 16 and 20 (Original), yielding a
total of 17 659 observations for the prospective analyses.
Although the sonographic equipment differed across study
examinations,
all
echocardiograms
were
performed
by
experienced technicians and evaluated using a standardized
protocol by trained study cardiologists. As is recommended
in the American Society of Echocardiography guidelines,
LAD
was
determined
from
M-mode
echocardiographic
images using a leading-edge-to-leading-edge method, mea-
suring the maximal distance between the posterior aortic
root wall and the posterior LA wall at end-systole. The FHS
has reported excellent reproducibility for M-mode-based
LAD measures.9,20
Atrial Fibrillation
At each FHS examination, a 12-lead ECG is obtained. In
addition, FHS study participants were asked whether or not
they have a diagnosis of AF at all study examinations as well
as during biennial health updates. Records of all interim
hospitalizations were sought for review. If a participant
reported any cardiovascular or neurological disease, all
inpatient and outpatient medical records were obtained.
Multiple sources, including 12-lead ECGs obtained at each
FHS examination, as well as ECGs obtained during cardiovas-
cular disease–related hospitalizations and clinician visits,
were used to ascertain for AF. In addition, inpatient telemetric
data were adjudicated for possible AF. Follow-up for incident

 AF ended in 2013. Cases of potential AF underwent
adjudication by 2 or more study reviewers (including DDM
and EJB).18,20 FHS participants were considered to have AF if
they had either AF or flutter present on any study or clinically
obtained ECG, on a Holter monitor, or if AF was documented
in the hospital record by a treating physician.
Statistical Analyses
Normally distributed continuous variables are described as
means�SD and compared using a mixed model, while non-
normal continuous variables are summarized using quartiles
and compared using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. Categorical
variables and compared using the v2 test and are presented
as n (%).
We assessed the effects of alcohol use on AF by LAD by
examining the association of alcohol use with LAD, the first
link in the proposed pathway, and then determining whether
adjustment for the most recent LAD attenuated the associ-
ation of cumulative alcohol use up to the time of the LAD
assessment with subsequent incidence of AF; in this analysis,
both cumulative alcohol use and LAD were treated as time-
dependent covariates. To be included in the analysis,
participants had to have at least 1 LAD assessment, with
alcohol exposure measured to the time of the assessment, as
well as subsequent follow-up for AF. A linear mixed model was
used to estimate the adjusted association between cumula-
tive alcohol intake, as a time-dependent covariate (TDC), with
repeated measures of LAD, accounting for within-individual
correlation using random intercepts (Figure 1). Based on prior
associations with AF and their associations with LAD in
univariate analyses, the linear mixed model was adjusted for
age, age2, sex, body mass index, systolic blood pressure,
antihypertensive treatment, electrocardiographic PR interval,
prevalent valvular heart disease or heart failure, and the
interaction terms=sex9age2, age9valvular heart disease, as
well as age9heart failure. In checking the linear mixed model,
we assessed normality of the residuals and used likelihood
ratio tests to determine the need for more complicated
modeling of within-subject correlation. In a second model, we
adjusted for age, sex, cohort, body mass index, diabetes
mellitus, hypertension, heart failure, heart rate, smoking, and
left ventricular ejection fraction.
Nested Cox proportional hazards models were used to
estimate the adjusted association of cumulative alcohol use
with AF, before and after adjustment for LAD. The TDCs

 capturing alcohol use and LAD were defined to preserve
temporal ordering, and thus make causal interpretation more
plausible. Specifically, as shown in Figure 2, cumulative
alcohol use was assessed in the Original cohort using data
from Examinations 2 through 20 and after examination 20;
LAD was assessed at Examinations 16 and 20; and then these
combinations of TDCs were used to predict incident AF
between Examinations 16 and 20, and after Examination 20.
Similarly, in the Offspring cohort, alcohol use was succes-
sively summarized using data up to and including Examina-
tions 2, 4, 5, 6, and 8; the corresponding TDCs for LAD were
assessed at Examinations 2, 4, 5, 6, and 8; and then each
combination of TDCs was used to predict incident AF in the
intervals between Examinations 2 and 4, 4 and 5, 5 and 6, 6
and 8, and after Examination 8.
Attenuation by LAD was assessed as the percent attenu-
ation of the adjusted regression coefficient for cumulative
alcohol consumption after additional adjustment for LAD, with
a 95% bootstrap confidence interval (CI). Based on their
known association with AF, certain clinical and ECG variables
were selected for inclusion in both Cox models: including age,
age2,
sex,
body
mass
index,
systolic
blood
pressure,
antihypertensive treatment, electrocardiographic PR interval,
prevalent valvular heart disease or heart failure, as well as
interactions between sex and age2, age and valvular heart
disease, and age and heart failure.22 In a second model, the
analysis was adjusted for age, sex, cohort, body mass index,
diabetes, hypertension, heart failure, heart rate, smoking, and
left ventricular ejection fraction. The proportional hazards
assumption was verified using score components.23
SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) was used for all
statistical analyses. Two-tailed P<0.05 were considered
statistically significant.
Results
The salient clinical and echocardiographic characteristics of
the 5220 participants included in our analysis are shown in
Table 1. Our cohort was middle-aged (mean age 56.3 years),
over half were women, and most were unaffected by
cardiovascular disease. The average alcohol consumption
reported by participants was 13.3�16.7 g/day and the mean
LAD at study onset was 38.3�5.4 mm. The overall incidence

 of AF was 8.4 per 1000 person years (based on a total of
1088 incident AF cases out of 17 659 observations) over a
median 6.0 (interquartile range 4.0–8.7) years of follow-up.
Total alcohol intake and baseline LAD did not vary significantly
by cohort.
After multivariable adjustment, every additional 10 g of
alcohol consumed per day (just under 1 drink) was associated
with a 0.16 mm (95% CI, 0.11–0.22 mm) higher LAD
(Table 2). The association between alcohol and LAD did not
vary significantly by cohort (P=0.13). However, there was no
significant association between alcohol and the change in
LAD (P=0.18) adjusting for the covariates (Table 3). Alcohol
consumption was not associated with change in left atrial size
over time among men or women (Table 3).
Chronic alcohol consumption was also associated with
higher risk for incident AF. In multivariable adjusted analysis,
every 10 g per day of alcohol consumed was associated with
a 5% higher risk of developing new-onset AF (hazard ratio,
1.05; 95% CI, 1.01–1.09; Table 4).

 followed for over 6 years for AF, we observed that heavier
self-reported alcohol consumption related to greater left atrial
size and higher risk for incident AF. We observed that up to a
quarter (and up to 75%) of the association between alcohol
and AF was mediated by echocardiographic LAD. The
attenuation of the association between alcohol and incident
AF after adjustment for LAD is consistent with the hypothesis
that LA enlargement is a key intermediate phenotype along
the causal pathway to AF.
Principal Findings
Despite the widely held belief by the public that alcohol has a
beneficial effect on general heart health, acute alcohol
consumption has long been linked to development of AF.24
In the Framingham, Copenhagen, and Women’s Health
Studies, chronic alcohol consumption, especially 2 or more
drinks per day, is associated with up to 30% higher risk for
incident AF.1–3 Acute alcohol exposure enhances electro-
physiologic vulnerability to AF in experimental models,7 but
our
understanding
of
the
mechanisms
underlying
the
observed epidemiological associations between alcohol and
AF remains incomplete. The paucity of data relating to the
downstream structural and electrophysiological effects of
chronic alcohol consumption on the atrium stand in contrast
to the abundance of data linking alcohol to ventricular
enlargement and systolic dysfunction.25
Understanding the mechanisms underlying the relation-
ships between alcohol and AF is important for several
reasons. First, some patients may benefit from moderate
consumption of alcohol,26–28 and identifying those at risk for
cardiovascular-system harm (such as given evidence of LA
enlargement) may help to counsel patients regarding their
specific risks versus benefits appropriately. Second, as the
etiology of AF remains incompletely understood in the
majority of patients, identifying mechanisms of known risk
factors might help to reveal new therapeutic targets. Third, as
alcohol may represent a modifiable risk factor for AF,
elucidating the nature by which the substance may enhance
AF risk is important.
LA structural remodeling, as assessed by LAD, relates to
advancing age, male sex, higher body mass index, and greater
blood pressure, all key risk factors for AF. Exposure to AF risk
factors influences tracking of LAD over the adult life course,
LA enlargement preceding AF, and higher LAD conferring an
increased risk for incident and recurrent AF.9,29–32 Chronic
alcohol consumption has been associated with ventricular
dilation and left ventricular dysfunction.1,25,28 Recent studies
suggest that atrial remodeling and AF may also result from
alcohol exposure.8 We sought to better understand the
associations between chronic alcohol consumption, atrial
remodeling, and incident AF. Atrial remodeling is a process
characterized by structural and electrophysiological change.
Pathological remodeling facilitates the creation of an atrial
substrate that is vulnerable to AF initiation, AF persistence,
and AF recurrence.9,29–33 LA enlargement, as characterized by
echocardiographic LAD, is related to incident AF, heart failure,
stroke, and mortality.9,29–33 LA enlargement is sometimes
seen in association with valvular or ischemic heart disease,
and in these settings can reflect atrial volume or pressure
overload, or as a consequence of AF.13,14,32,34
The findings of several recent investigations suggest that
chronic consumption of alcohol may lead to LA-specific
structural and electrophysiological remodeling.8,30 In 1 cross-
sectional study including over 4000 elderly Atherosclerosis
Risk in Community study participants, increasing alcohol
intake was associated with larger left ventricular diastolic and
systolic diameters as well as larger LA diameter (P<0.05).8 We
observed a similar association between alcohol consumption
and LAD in a larger and younger ambulatory cohort affected
by less cardiovascular comorbidity and with modest con-
sumption of alcohol. However, we were not able to detect a
statistically significant association between alcohol consump-
tion and change in LAD over serial echocardiograms. One
possible explanation for this negative finding is the fact that
the effect of chronic alcohol consumption on LA size requires
several years or even decades. As such, the first echocardio-
gram reflects a greater burden of alcohol-related change than
is captured by the serial echocardiographic images obtained
over a relatively short period of time. Another possible
explanation for this finding relates to the fact that alcohol
leads to an increase in LAD only up to a point (quantified by
the first echo), but with limited or negligible subsequent
effect. Lastly, this analysis required that at least 2 LAD
measurements be required for inclusion and limited statistical
power may have been responsible for our inability to detect
significant
relations
between
alcohol
consumption
and
change in LAD over time.
Our study is novel in that it leveraged the serial assess-
ments of LA size and alcohol consumption as part of the FHS
to conduct a comprehensive assessment of the relations
between fluctuating levels of alcohol consumption and LAD
change over time. In another single-center study of 122
patients undergoing pulmonary vein isolation, heavier alcohol

 consumption was related to greater atrial scar burden, as
measured using low-voltage recordings during electrophysiol-
ogy study, and AF recurrence postablation. Notably, mediation
analyses suggested that the low-voltage area (a surrogate for
atrial scar burden) was a mediator of the effect of alcohol
consumption on AF recurrence after ablation. The results of
our investigation extend and support these findings by
suggesting that echocardiographic LAD may also reflect atrial
remodeling burden from alcohol consumption and that
alcohol-induced pathological atrial remodeling may mediate
the relationship between alcohol and new-onset AF in the
community.10
Strengths and Limitations
The strengths of our study include the use of a large,
community-based
sample
with
standardized
echocardio-
graphic observations and standardized evaluation of alcohol
consumption as well as other cardiovascular risk factors. We
recognize several limitations to our analyses. First, AF may be
asymptomatic and not clinically detected. Although it remains
possible that LA enlargement might occur because of
undetected AF, rather than directly because of alcohol, occult
AF would likely bias our results toward the null hypothesis and
would not lead to false-positive associations. Second, the
anteroposterior LA dimension provided by M-mode and used
for the determination of LAD in our analyses may not reflect
true atrial size. Although the LA generally enlarges in a
spherical fashion, symmetrical enlargement does not always
occur, and thus volumetric assessment of LA size is a more
accurate measure of true atrial size. M-mode-based LA
assessment is, however, a well-studied and valid measure of
LA size,19 and we were limited by the availability of only M-
mode data in the Framingham Study at the earlier examina-
tion cycles. Third, participants in the cohort were middle-aged
to older adults and largely white, limiting the generalizability
of our findings to other age or racial groups.
Conclusions
Given the increasing population burden of AF and the high
prevalence of alcohol consumption among Americans, it is
important to characterize the relationships between alcohol
consumption and AF and to identify important potential
intermediate
phenotypes,
such
as
increased
LAD.
Our
prospective, community-based investigation identified signif-
icant associations between alcohol and AF as well as alcohol
and LAD. Furthermore, mediation analyses suggest that a
substantial proportion of the association between alcohol and
AF is mediated by LAD. These data, although observational,
are
consistent
with
the
notion
that
chronic
alcohol
consumption, even at moderate levels, can be cardiotoxic
and lead to pathological atrial structural change that can, in
turn, enhance vulnerability to AF later in life.
