CONTEXT: Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is a leading cause of postneonatal infant 
mortality. Our previous meta-analyses showed that any breastfeeding is protective against 
SIDS with exclusive breastfeeding conferring a stronger effect.The duration of breastfeeding 
required to confer a protective effect is unknown.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the associations between breastfeeding duration and SIDS.
DATA SOURCES: Individual-level data from 8 case-control studies.
STUDY SELECTION: Case-control SIDS studies with breastfeeding data.
DATA EXTRACTION: Breastfeeding variables, demographic factors, and other potential 
confounders were identified. Individual-study and pooled analyses were performed.
RESULTS: A total of 2267 SIDS cases and 6837 control infants were included. In multivariable 
pooled analysis, breastfeeding for <2 months was not protective (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 
0.91, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.68–1.22). Any breastfeeding ≥2 months was protective, 
with greater protection seen with increased duration (2–4 months: aOR: 0.60, 95% CI:  
0.44–0.82; 4–6 months: aOR: 0.40, 95% CI: 0.26–0.63; and >6 months: aOR: 0.36, 95% CI: 
0.22–0.61). Although exclusive breastfeeding for <2 months was not protective (aOR: 0.82, 
95% CI: 0.59–1.14), longer periods were protective (2–4 months: aOR: 0.61, 95% CI:  
0.42–0.87; 4–6 months: aOR: 0.46, 95% CI: 0.29–0.74).
LIMITATIONS: The variables collected in each study varied slightly, limiting our ability to include 
all studies in the analysis and control for all confounders.
CONCLUSIONS: Breastfeeding duration of at least 2 months was associated with half the risk of 
SIDS. Breastfeeding does not need to be exclusive to confer this protection.

 Breastfeeding has been shown in 
several studies to be associated 
with a decreased risk of sudden 
infant death syndrome (SIDS).1 
– 
3 
In a previous meta-analysis, we 
have shown that breastfeeding is 
protective against SIDS (adjusted 
odds ratio [aOR]: 0.55, 95% 
confidence interval [CI]: 0.44–0.69 
for any breastfeeding) and that this 
protective effect is stronger with 
exclusive breastfeeding (odds ratio 
[OR]: 0.27, 95% CI: 0.24–0.31).3
However, it has been difficult 
to determine what duration of 
breastfeeding is required to confer 
a protective effect against SIDS. This 
may partly be because the incidence 
of breastfeeding across countries 
and different cultures varies and 
because the authors of different 
studies investigating the association 
with SIDS use different definitions 
for any breastfeeding, exclusive 
breastfeeding, and the duration of 
either practice. Meta-analyses of 
breastfeeding duration at the study 
level are difficult to undertake, and, 
so far, the effect size and the duration 
of breastfeeding required to confer 
this protective effect have not been 
quantified.
We therefore aimed to use individual-
level data from international 
studies and, with cooperation of 
the individual authors, to assess the 
associations between duration of 
any breastfeeding versus exclusive 
breastfeeding and SIDS.
MeThODs
We used the same review protocol 
as that in our previously reported 
meta-analysis.3 We searched the 
Ovid Medline database (January 
1966 through December 2009) to 
collect data on breastfeeding and its 
association with SIDS. The search 
strategy included published articles 
limited to humans with the medical 
subject headings terms “sudden 
infant death” and “breast feeding” 
and with the key words “sudden 
infant death syndrome, 
” “SIDS, 
” 
“cot death, 
” and “breastfeeding.” 
Of the 18 studies included in the 
meta-analysis, individual level 
data were provided from 8 large 
case-control studies of SIDS deaths, 
which comprise all of the published 
case-control studies with individual-
level data about breastfeeding 
status. In all studies, there were 
strict definitions and protocols for 
determining SIDS cases. The cause 
of death had to be ascertained 
by local medical examiners or 
pediatric or forensic pathologists. 
No studies without individual-level 
data were included. All data were 
obtained via direct contact with the 
original investigators for each case-
control study. Data were checked 
by the original investigators for 
completeness and consistency before 
being released for this analysis. The 
studies included are detailed below.
The New Zealand Cot Death study
The New Zealand Cot Death Study 
(NZCDS) was a national case-control 
study of all SIDS deaths that took 
place from November 1987 through 
October 1990. The authors of the 
study successfully recruited and 
obtained data from 393 case patients 
and 1592 controls, who were 
randomly selected from all birth 
cohorts, but with an age distribution 
to match the age of patients from 
cases from 1979 to 1984.4 Data 
were obtained by an interviewer-
administered questionnaire and 
from hospital obstetric records, 
which included data about the type 
of feeding at the time of hospital 
discharge. Parents were asked 
whether the infant received any 
breast milk at any stage of life, in 
the first 4 weeks, and in the last 2 
days. In addition, parents of infants 
who received any breast milk were 
asked at what stage breastfeeding 
stopped (age in weeks). Coding was 
available for never started and still 
breastfeeding.
The Chicago Infant Mortality study
The authors of the Chicago Infant 
Mortality Study (CIMS) studied all 
SIDS deaths in Chicago, Illinois, 
between November 1993 and April 
1996, and they included 260 case 
patients and 260 controls, who were 
matched by maternal ethnicity, age 
at death, and birth weight.5 Data 
on breastfeeding were collected 
by a standardized interviewer-
administered questionnaire. Parents 
were asked if the child had ever been 
breastfed, if the child was still being 
breastfed, and how old the child 
was when breastfeeding stopped. In 
addition, data on other methods of 
feeding and when they were started 
were collected so that duration of 
exclusive breastfeeding could be 
calculated.
The German sIDs study
The German SIDS Study (GeSID) 
was conducted in 11 of 18 states 
in the former Federal Republic 
of Germany between November 
1998 and October 2001. The study 
included 333 SIDS case patients and 
998 controls, who were matched 
by geographic region, age, sex, and 
reference sleep (ie, time of sleep 
was matched to the time of death 
for the respective case).6 Data 
on breastfeeding were collected 
by a standardized, interviewer-
administered questionnaire. 
Questions were asked about 
breastfeeding at 2 weeks of age and 
at each month of age through 12 
months (when applicable) and about 
whether this breastfeeding was 
exclusive.
The scottish Cot Death Trust study
The Scottish Cot Death Trust study 
took place between January 1996 
and May 2000. Data were collected 
on 131 SIDS case patients and 278 
control infants, who were matched 
by age, season, and obstetric unit.7 
Data on breastfeeding were collected 
by a standardized, interviewer-
administered questionnaire.

 Questions were asked about which 
types of feeding the infant had and, if 
not breastfed currently, whether they 
had ever breastfed and when they 
stopped.
european Concerted Action on sIDs
The European Concerted Action on 
SIDS (ECAS) comprised case-control 
studies in 20 regions in Europe 
between September 1992 and April 
1996.8 Data for the current analyses 
were restricted to those centers for 
which we had not obtained data 
from elsewhere (Sweden, Norway, 
Denmark, Netherlands, Austria, 
Hungary, Ukraine, Spain, Italy, 
Russia, Slovenia, France, Belgium, 
Poland, and the United Kingdom 
[Cambridge]). Data were collected 
for 382 SIDS case patients and 1159 
controls. Data on breastfeeding 
exclusivity and duration were 
collected by interviewer-
administered questionnaires. 
Questions were asked about how the 
infant was being fed at the time of 
death or interview.
Irish study of Infant Death
The Irish study was part of an 
ongoing case-control study of infant 
death in the Republic of Ireland that 
began collecting data in 1994 and 
continued until 2010.9, 
 
10 Controls 
were matched by date of birth and 
geographical location. The data 
included in this analysis comprise 
363 case patients and 1163 controls 
for the period from 1994 to 2003. 
Data on breastfeeding exclusivity 
and duration were collected during 
standardized home interviews.
Confidential Inquiry Into stillbirth 
and Deaths in Infancy
The Confidential Inquiry Into 
Stillbirth and Deaths in Infancy 
(CESDI) included 5 regions of 
England between 1993 and 1996.11 
Data were collected for 325 SIDS 
case patients and 1300 controls, who 
were matched by age and health 
visitor. Data were collected for 
duration of breastfeeding; however, 
no information on the duration 
of exclusive breastfeeding was 
collected.
south-West england Infant sleep 
study
The South-West England Infant Sleep 
Study (SWISS) included 2 regions in 
the South-West of England between 
2003 and 2006.12 Data were collected 
for 80 SIDS case patients and 87 
controls. Data were collected for the 
duration of breastfeeding; however, 
no information on the duration 
of exclusive breastfeeding was 
collected.
Definitions of Breastfeeding 
Variables
Duration of any breastfeeding was 
defined as the length of time that 
the infant received any human 
milk, through breastfeeding or 
expressed breast milk, either 
exclusively or in combination 
with other foods (including infant 
formula). We defined the duration 
of any breastfeeding as a continuous 
variable; we created a categorical 
variable for the duration of any 
breastfeeding (0–2, 2–4, 4–6, and >6 
months).
Duration of exclusive breastfeeding 
was defined as the length of time 
that the infant received only human 
milk, either through breastfeeding 
or expressed breast milk.13 We 
defined the duration of exclusive 
breastfeeding as a continuous 
variable; we created a categorical 
variable for the duration of exclusive 
breastfeeding (0–2, 2–4, and >4 
months). A variable for >6 months 
was not created because of the small 
numbers in this group in most of the 
studies.
statistical Analysis
Analysis was performed for each 
study individually, and then data 
were combined for a pooled analysis. 
A pooled univariable analysis, 
using all 8 studies, was conducted, 
controlling for study. A multivariable 
model was then fitted by using 3 of 
the studies (the NZCDS, CIMS, and 
GeSID) for which all 19 potential 
confounders were available (model 1). 
 
These confounders had initially 
been assessed as being available and 
consistent across these 3 studies at 
the inception of each study and have 
been identified as risk or protective 
factors for SIDS: sleep position at last 
sleep (supine, side, prone), maternal 
smoking during pregnancy (yes/no), 
bed-sharing in the last sleep (infant 
sleeping with another person on  
the same surface) (yes/no),  
room-sharing in the last sleep (infant 
sleeping in the same room as an 
adult caregiver but on a separate 
surface) (yes/no), use of a dummy 
or pacifier in the last sleep (yes/no), 
maternal age, prenatal care received 
(yes/no), marital status (married/
not married), parity (primiparous/
multiparous), maternal education 
(university graduate or not), 
socioeconomic status (SES) (low, 
middle, high), infant age (<13, 13–19, 
20–26, and >26 weeks), infant sex, 
admission to a special care infant 
unit (yes/no), season at death, birth 
weight (<2500 g, 2500–2999 g,  
3000–3499 g, and ≥3500 g), 
gestational age at birth (28–33, 
34–37, and 38+ weeks), multiple 
pregnancy (yes/no), and cesarean 
delivery (yes/no). Additional models 
were then fitted to include the 
other 5 studies, at the expense of 
reducing the number of confounders 
but increasing the sample size. 
These sequential models did not 
include the following confounders: 
cesarean delivery (the CESDI and 
SWISS included in model, model 2), 
SES and season (the Irish and ECAS 
studies included, model 3), and, 
finally, antenatal care and maternal 
education level (the Scottish study 
included, model 4).
All analyses were conducted in SAS 
version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, 
NC). ORs were estimated by using 
the proc logistic procedure, with

 a strata statement for study in 
pooled analyses. Survival curves 
were produced for duration of any 
breastfeeding for control groups 
by using proc lifetest, with data 
censored if breastfeeding was  
still taking place. Statistical 
significance was defined at the 5% 
level.
This study was approved by the 
institutional review board at the 
University of Virginia. In addition, 
the individual studies were approved 
by the institutional ethical review 
boards and/or ethics committees 
according to the laws and standards 
of each country.
ResulTs
There are 8 SIDS case-control studies 
with individual-level data; all were 
included (see Supplemental Fig 2 
flow diagram). A total of 2267 SIDS 
case patients and 6837 control 
infants were included in this analysis. 
There was great variability in the 
rates of any breastfeeding and 
exclusive breastfeeding in the studies 
(log rank: 1659.6, P < .0001). This 
is illustrated in Fig 1, which shows 
survival curves for any breastfeeding 
for controls from each of the studies. 
Breastfeeding rates were highest 
in New Zealand and lowest in the 
United States, with the European 
countries having intermediate 
rates. At 6 months, the rate of any 
breastfeeding ranged from over 50% 
in the NZCDS and ECAS to <10% in 
several of the studies.
Any Breastfeeding
The univariable effects of any 
breastfeeding stratified by study 
and the pooled analyses are shown 
in Table 1. The analysis categorizing 
duration of any breastfeeding 
showed that those who breastfed 
for <2 months incurred a protective 
effect (OR: 0.61, 95% CI: 0.54–0.69) 
and that those breastfeeding 
for 2 to 4 months had a greater 
protective effect (OR: 0.26, 95% CI: 
0.22–0.30). Breastfeeding duration 
beyond 4 months provided further 
small increases in protection (4–6 
months: OR: 0.18, 95% CI: 0.14–
0.23; 6+ months: OR: 0.13, 95% 
CI: 0.10–0.18). The multivariable 
pooled analysis for the 3 studies 
with all 19 confounders controlled 
for found ongoing protective 
effects of any breastfeeding 
beyond 2 months (2–4 months: 
aOR: 0.60, 95% CI: 0.44–0.82; 
4–6 months: aOR: 0.40, 95% CI: 
0.26–0.63; and 6+ months: aOR: 
0.36, 95% CI: 0.22–0.61) (Table 2). 
However, breastfeeding for 0 to 2 
months did not have a statistically 
significant protective effect (aOR: 
0.91, 95% CI: 0.68–1.21). The 
removal of cesarean delivery 
from the model had little effect 
on the ORs; however, the removal 
of SES and season in model 3

 saw the protective effects of any 
breastfeeding become stronger. 
The further removal of maternal 
education and antenatal care 
in model 4 had little additional 
influence on the aOR, but this result 
reached statistical significance 
(aOR: 0.83, 95% CI: 0.70–0.99).
exclusive Breastfeeding
The stratified and pooled analysis 
for the univariable effects of 
exclusive breastfeeding is shown in 
 
Table 1. The analysis categorizing 
the duration of exclusive 
breastfeeding showed that those 
who exclusively breastfed for <2 
months incurred a protective effect 
(OR: 0.61 95% CI: 0.53–0.71) and 
that those breastfeeding 2 to 4 
months had a greater protective 
effect (OR: 0.25, 95% CI: 0.20–
0.30). Exclusive breastfeeding 
for >4 months provided a further 
increase in protection (OR: 0.16, 
95% CI: 0.12–0.21). As in the 
multivariable analysis for any 
breastfeeding, which controlled 
for all potential confounders, those 
who breastfed exclusively for <2 
months did not see any statistically 
significant protective effect (aOR: 
0.82, 95% CI: 0.59–1.14), but those 
who breastfed for longer than 2 
months incurred a protective effect 
(aOR: 0.61, 95% CI: 0.42–0.97) 
for 2 to 4 months, with increasing 
protection with longer duration 
(aOR: 0.46, 95% CI: 0.29–0.74) for 
those exclusively breastfeeding 
>4 months. Similarly, the removal 
of SES and season from the model 
made the effect sizes slightly 
stronger (Table 3).
DIsCussION
We conducted a pooled analysis 
of individual-level data from 8 
major international case-control 
studies with 2259 case patients 
and 6894 controls to assess the 
association between duration of 
any breastfeeding versus exclusive 
breastfeeding and SIDS. Although 
there was some protection seen 
with breastfeeding for <2 months in 
univariable analysis, after controlling 
for potential confounders, we 
found no statistically significant 
protection against SIDS until 
infants had breastfed for at least 2 
months. After 2 months, the aOR 
for any breastfeeding was 0.60 
(95% CI: 0.44–0.82), whereas the 
aOR for exclusive breastfeeding 
was 0.61 (95% CI: 0.42–0.87). It is 
thus important that public health 
messages about SIDS risk reduction 
emphasize that breastfeeding, if it 
is to be protective, must continue 
for at least 2 months. This analysis 
does not reveal any advantage 
to exclusive breastfeeding over 
partial breastfeeding, which may 
be reassuring to some parents who 
cannot or do not wish to exclusively 
breastfeed their infant.
It is yet unclear why breastfeeding 
offers protective effects against 
SIDS. The authors of physiologic, 
neuropathologic, and genetic studies 
point to dysfunctional arousal 
responses as a mechanism that 
creates an intrinsic vulnerability 
in the infant, which predisposes 
the infant to SIDS, 
14 and breastfed 
infants are more easily aroused from 
sleep than are formula-fed infants.15, 
 
16  
There are also differences in 
maternal responses to an infant’s 
behavioral cues, depending on 
feeding mode, which may impact 
infant sleep and arousal patterns.17, 
18  
Additionally, breastfeeding provides 
immune benefits and is associated 
with a lower incidence of viral 
infections, which are associated with 
an increased risk of SIDS.19 
– 
21 Breast 
milk contains substances that may 
contribute to myelin development; 
Kinney and co-authors found that 
infants who died of SIDS had delayed 
myelination of the brain compared 
with control infants.22 Breast milk 
also contains higher levels than 
formula of docosahexaenoic acid,

Downloaded from 
 which is an important structural 
and functional component of the 
developing infant brain. One study 
of autopsied brains of SIDS infants 
found that the frontal lobes of the 
breastfed infants had higher levels 
of docosahexaenoic acid than those 
of formula-fed infants; it is unknown 
if this difference exists in non-SIDS 
infants.23 Finally, it is possible that 
breastfeeding is a distal marker of or 
proxy for complex protective infant 
care practices that have not yet 
been measured, although we would 
expect that such a marker would 
be related to sociodemographic 
variables that have been controlled 
for in these analyses.
It is unclear why exclusive 
breastfeeding did not offer any 
additional protection against 
SIDS than any, that is, partial, 
breastfeeding. This is a common 
challenge in studies in which the 
differential effects of exclusive and 
partial breastfeeding have been 
examined, because of the differing 
definitions of breastfeeding and 
confounding factors.1, 
 
24 The analysis 
accounted for as many demographic 
and risk factor variables as were 
possible, but we acknowledge that 
the effects reported could be caused 
by residual confounding, although 
this would be unlikely. It was notable 
that the inclusion of studies that did 
not have data on SES increased the 
protective effect further from the 
null, thus seemingly showing the 
importance of SES as a confounder 
in relation to breastfeeding. Given 
that lower SES is a risk factor for 
SIDS, it is possible that the protective 
effect of SES may in part be explained 
by increased breastfeeding rates. 
However, model 3, which did not 
have data on SES, also did not have 
data on season. Although SES is 
associated with breastfeeding, it is 
unlikely that there is a relationship 
between season and breastfeeding; 
thus, we believe that these changes in 
estimates are likely to be associated 
with SES.
Other limitations of this study are 
related to issues with combining 
data in the individual case-control 
studies. These case-control studies 
were all conducted in a rigorous 
manner and are the basis for 
most of the current infant safe 
sleep guidelines in developed 
countries.25 
– 
27 However, as noted 
above, the variables collected in 
the course of each study varied 
slightly, limiting our ability to 
include all studies in the analysis 
and control for all confounders. 
However, the results of the 
univariable analysis using only the 3 
countries included in the completely 
controlled multivariable model 
(model 1) did not differ greatly 
from the univariable analysis with 
all 8 studies, so it is unlikely that 
including the additional studies 
would have changed the results  
of the analysis in any meaningful 
way.
Given these findings, there should 
be ongoing concerted efforts to 
increase the rates of breastfeeding 
initiation and maintenance. 
Among the control infants in 5 of 
the 8 countries in this analysis, 
the proportion of infants who 
were breastfeeding was <50% 
at 2 months of age and <30% at 
4 months of age. In more recent 
years, national breastfeeding rates 
have increased; 2007 Organisation 
for Economic Co-operation and 
Development data show that the 
proportions of infants who were 
ever breastfed in the countries 
included in our study were 42% in 
Ireland, 75% in the United States, 
77% in the United Kingdom, 85% 
in New Zealand, and 89% in the 
European Union.28 The World 
Health Organization’s 2025 targets 
for breastfeeding are to have >50% 
of infants exclusively breastfeeding 
for at least 6 months.13 Further 
increases in breastfeeding rates will 
result in lower infant mortality as a 
whole24, 
 
29 and in decreases in SIDS 
rates, 
3 specifically.
CONClusIONs
Breastfeeding duration of a minimum 
of 2 months appears to be necessary 
to confer a significant protective 
effect against SIDS, with an almost 
halving of the risk. The protective 
benefits of breastfeeding increase 
as the duration increases. However, 
exclusive breastfeeding does not 
confer additional benefits over partial 
breastfeeding with regards to SIDS 
risk reduction. Therefore, mothers 
should be encouraged to breastfeed 
for at least 2 months (and preferably 
longer). Even if mothers are unable 
to exclusively breastfeed, they can 
feel reassured that any breastfeeding 
provides protection against SIDS for 
their infants. Further study is still 
needed to better understand the 
mechanisms by which breastfeeding 
offers protection.
