Abstract
Background
The number of jurisdictions allowing access to medicinal cannabis has been steadily
increasing since the state of California introduced legislation in 1996. Although there is a
high degree of legislative heterogeneity across jurisdictions, the involvement of a health pro-
fessional is common among all. This places health professionals at the forefront of therapy,
yet no systematic review of literature has offered insight into the beliefs, knowledge, and
concerns of health professionals regarding medicinal cannabis.
Methods
Using a predetermined study protocol, PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and Sco-
pus databases were searched for studies indexed up to the 1st August 2018. Pre-defined
inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied uniformly. Screening for relevancy, full-text
review, data extraction, and risk of bias were completed by two independent investigators.
Risk of bias was assessed using CASP criteria (qualitative) and a modified domain-based
risk assessment tool (quantitative).
Results
Of the 15,775 studies retrieved, 106 underwent full-text review and of these, 26 were
included. The overall risk of bias was considered low across all included studies. The gen-
eral impression was that health professionals supported the use of medicinal cannabis in
practice; however, there was a unanimous lack of self-perceived knowledge surrounding all
aspects of medicinal cannabis. Health professionals also voiced concern regarding direct
patient harms and indirect societal harms.

 Conclusion
This systematic review has offered a lens through which to view the existing literature sur-
rounding the beliefs, knowledge, and concerns of health professionals regarding medicinal
cannabis. These results are limited, however, by the implicit common-sense models of
behaviour utilised by the included studies. Before strategies can be developed and imple-
mented to change health professional behaviour, a more thorough understanding of the fac-
tors that underpin the delivery of medicinal cannabis is necessary.
Introduction
Current literature suggests that cannabis was first used medicinally by the ancient Chinese
before spreading throughout the rest of the world.[1, 2] Although there is difficulty discerning
medicinal and non-secular use during early periods, it was by anecdote that cannabis was
passed down and considered medically useful.[2, 3] Cannabis continued to be used medici-
nally until the early-20th century.[4] It was this period of time that saw the prohibition of
opium and coca leaves with prohibition extending to cannabis due to its psychoactive proper-
ties. The penultimate prohibitive effort was the signing of the 1961 United Nations Single Con-
vention on Narcotic Drugs.[5] Under this convention, cannabis was considered to have an
extremely limited therapeutic value while simultaneously being considered to be a high risk of
dependence and misuse.[5] Subsequently, generations of health professionals were educated in
a system where cannabis was considered purely illicit. More recent studies have demonstrated,
however, a plausible rationale for therapeutic action.[6–8] Yet, there are difficulties translating
these findings into practice due to a number of issues surrounding the creation of evidence.
For instance, it has been very challenging to perform clinical trials on herbal cannabis due to
the enduring illicit status of cannabis across much of the world. Furthermore, studies per-
formed on pharmaceutical cannabis preparations often lack consistency in the products and
composition of cannabinoids used which makes comparison of trial results hard. Among oth-
ers, these difficulties are commonly acknowledged in studies examining cannabinoid prepara-
tions alongside calls for further large, robust randomised controlled trials to confirm the
effects of cannabinoids relative to safety and efficacy.[9–12]
A public vote saw the State of California approve the use of medicinal cannabis in 1996.[13]
Since this time, many other jurisdictions have legislated for medicinal cannabis.[14] Although
all jurisdictions are using different regulatory frameworks, common among all is the involve-
ment of a health professional in the delivery of medicinal cannabis.[15, 16] For purposes of
this study, ‘delivery’ includes authorisation and supply. Depending on the jurisdiction, autho-
risation can include medical recommendations or prescribing, while supply involves the dis-
pensing and administration of medicinal cannabis.[15, 16] It is for this reason that a review of
health professionals’ beliefs and knowledge of medicinal cannabis is important. Without the
support of these key stakeholders it is likely that many who may benefit from medicinal canna-
bis will not receive therapy. By working to better understand the broader context in which
health professionals deliver medicinal cannabis, further strategies can be devised to change
health professional behaviour moving forward.
The principal aim of this study is to systematically review the existing literature surround-
ing health professional beliefs, knowledge, and concerns within the context of delivering
medicinal cannabis. It is important to note that this study is neither positioned in support or

 against the availability of medicinal cannabis. As per the aim, the position of this study is to
strictly report the beliefs, knowledge, and concerns of health professional delivering medicinal
cannabis.
Methods
Using a pre-determined study protocol, a literature search was performed to identify studies
considering the beliefs, knowledge, and concerns of health professionals surrounding the
delivery of medicinal cannabis. The specific research questions addressed were:
1. How do health professionals feel about the use of medicinal cannabis in clinical practice?
2. How knowledgeable are health professionals regarding medicinal cannabis?
3. What concerns exist for health professionals regarding the delivery of medicinal cannabis
A preliminary review of the literature revealed an inconsistency in the way studies explor-
ing the views and beliefs of health professionals regarding medicinal cannabis were indexed.
As such, intentionally simple, yet broad search phrases were developed to ensure all relevant
studies were captured (S1 Table). Using the pre-determined search phrases, electronic searches
were conducted by the chief investigator (KG) using the PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Sco-
pus, and EMBASE databases for studies indexed between database inception and the 1st
August 2018. Cited reference lists were also examined. Electronic searches were limited to
studies involving humans and the English language, before duplicate entries were removed.
Screening for relevancy, full-text review, data extraction, and risk of bias evaluation were com-
pleted by two independent investigators (KG and JSi). Disagreements were discussed, and con-
sensus reached. If consensus could not be reached, a third investigator (GK) mediated. Full-
text review was considered against pre-specified inclusion and exclusion criteria. Inclusion cri-
teria were: (a) health professional participants; (b) the study was concerned with ‘medicinal’
cannabis; (c) the primary behaviour being studied was the delivery of medicinal cannabis.
Exclusion criteria were: (a) the study was indexed as an abstract, editorial, commentary, or
review; (b) the study was concerned with the ‘recreational’ use of cannabis; (c) non-profes-
sional or mixed professional-patient samples. Data were extracted from studies into a pre-
designed review form under the following categories: first author and publication year, study
design, country/state, target population, sample size, sampling methods, data collection meth-
ods, response rate, whether the data collection tool was piloted, outcome measures, and main
findings.
The method of evaluating bias varied according to each individual study’s design. The Criti-
cal Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) criteria tool was used to assess qualitative study
designs. Whereas no specific risk of bias tool exists for the assessment of observational, cross-
sectional study designs. In light of this, this review used the domain-based risk of bias evalua-
tion tool developed by Hoy et.al[17] as a foundation. Although this tool considers risk of bias
in prevalence studies, it acts as a template for consideration of the risk of bias in cross-sectional
studies. Minor modifications were made to this tool and were guided by Draugalis et.al[18]
and the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) state-
ment.[19] The modified tool considered the risk of bias in observational cross-sectional studies
and contained eleven items covering four domains of bias: selection bias, measurement bias,
non-response bias, and bias of data analysis. The risk of bias for each domain was considered
against pre-specified criteria (S1 File).
The findings of this review have been reported using the Preferred Reporting Items for Sys-
tematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.[20] Due to substantial

 heterogeneity in target populations, interjurisdictional policies, primary research aims, and
data collection methods, the gathered results were not combined for pooled analysis. This
review was registered with PROSPERO (ID: CRD42017067318).
Results
Study selection and characteristics
There were 15,775 studies retrieved through the search of the listed databases. From this
total, 3528 were removed due to a focus on a species other than humans, 601 were removed
due to being in a language other than English, and 7220 were removed as they were
retrieved in duplicate. Furthermore, 4320 studies were removed as these were deemed to be
irrelevant in the preliminary screening of the title, abstract, and keywords. This left 106 full-
text studies for screening against inclusion and exclusion criteria. Eighty studies did not
meet these pre-specified criteria, leaving twenty-six studies for inclusion in this systematic
review.[21–46] A flow diagram of study selection is shown in Fig 1. Of the 26 studies
included, 13 were conducted in the United States (US),[22, 25–28, 30, 33, 37, 38, 40–43]
four were conducted in Canada,[23, 32, 39, 45] three were conducted in Australia[34–36]
and Israel,[21, 31, 46] two were conducted in Ireland,[29, 44] and one covered an interna-
tional sample.[24] There were 18 studies that sampled medical practitioners,[21, 24–26, 28–
32, 34, 36, 37, 40–42, 44–46] and three studies that sampled pharmacists.[33, 35, 39] An
additional five studies included in this review were grouped according to the high propor-
tion of nursing professionals sampled.[22, 23, 27, 38, 43] One study sampled exclusively
nurse practitioners[23] while the other four studies sampled a mixed cohort of medical and
allied health professionals of which nurses were the predominant population.[22, 27, 38, 43]
Altogether, these five studies had a pooled sample of 1,584 participants including 847 (53%)
registered nurses and nurse practitioners, 495 (31%) medical practitioners, 118 (8%) phar-
macists, 37 (2%) social workers, 21 (1.5%) physician assistants, and three (0.5%) osteopathic
physicians. Also included in the pooled sample were 63 (4%) individuals described as
‘other’ which included an unknown proportion of medical practitioners and pharmacists. A
summary of study characteristics is displayed in S2 Table.
Risk of bias
Of the quantitative studies, two were considered to have a low risk of bias for each domain.[25,
41] Although the remaining twenty studies had varying levels of potential bias present, the
overall risk of bias across all included studies was low (Fig 2). This was especially true with
respect to measurement bias, non-response bias, and bias of data analysis. The impact of selec-
tion bias was largely unclear, however. This was mainly due to many studies not clearly justify-
ing their how their sample was representative of the study population, as well as the wide use
of non-probability sampling. As the four qualitative studies differed in their philosophical par-
adigms, the ten-item CASP criteria framework was broken down and used to evaluate the
main hallmarks of rigorous qualitative research: credibility, transferability, dependability, and
confirmability. Credibility is the confidence that can be placed in the truth of the research find-
ings while transferability is the degree by which results can be transferred to other contexts.
Dependability involves an evaluation of the findings and interpretations such that results are
supported by the data received and confirmability questions whether the results are shaped by
the participants or other potential biases. Within their respective philosophical paradigms, the
potential influence of bias for the qualitative studies was considered minimal (Fig 3).

 Beliefs, knowledge and concerns
Medical practitioners.
Of the 18 studies investigating medical practitioners’ perspectives,
none presented results that outright rejected the clinical usefulness of medicinal cannabis. Six
studies reported the majority of participants supporting the clinical usefulness of medicinal
cannabis.[21, 29, 31, 34, 36, 45] A further five studies indicated that participants believed
medicinal cannabis to be a viable therapeutic option.[25, 26, 30, 42, 46] In contrast, three

 studies revealed that the majority of participants believed medicinal cannabis to have a limited
role in their respective fields[32, 37, 41] while a further study reported a lack of confidence in
the use of cannabis as a treatment option.[40] In addition to the support and opposition of
medicinal cannabis, three studies reported a high proportion of neutrality when participants
were asked whether medicinal cannabis had any clinical utility.[24, 28, 44] Regardless of pre-
conceived beliefs; however, the relative support for medicinal cannabis increased if all other
treatment options were exhausted or if therapy was to be used in the palliative domain.[26, 28,
29, 36, 37, 40, 41]
With respect to knowledge, seven studies reported the self-perceived knowledge of the
pharmacology of phyto–and synthetocannabinoids to be predominantly very low on a five-
point Likert scale.[21, 31, 32, 34, 36, 37, 42, 45] Similarly, five of these studies also

 demonstrated that self-perceived legislative and procedural knowledge, including the specifics
around prescribing, cultivation and distribution was very low.[21, 32, 36, 42, 45] When dis-
cussing education, three studies reported a desire for more formal education across under-
graduate, postgraduate, and professional development curricula.[24, 31, 37] Furthermore, 70%
of Canadian physicians stated that they would feel more comfortable authorising medicinal
cannabis if formal education was provided.[45] Collectively, a self-perceived lack of knowledge
was reported as a significant barrier to authorisation, yet a lack of easy-to-access information
was also reported to be an noteworthy barrier.[26, 36, 42, 45] Additionally, two studies
reported that 20% and 60% of their respective samples used the news/media as a resource to
inform clinical decision-making.[24, 37]
Medical practitioners raised issues surrounding self-cultivation such as reproducibility and
contamination, the potential for recreational misuse, the potential for diversion into illicit
channels, the risk of drug-drug interactions, and driving under the influence of cannabis.[21,
24, 32, 36, 37, 42, 44, 45] Furthermore, medical practitioners were mindful of the potential
risks associated with uncontrolled supply.[31, 37] Finally, concern for the health of individual
patients was mostly focused around psychiatric adverse effects. Three studies indicated that
medical practitioners believed negative mental health outcomes were positively correlated
with the use of medicinal cannabis.[25, 26, 29, 37]
Pharmacists.
Of the three studies sampling pharmacists, only one captured pharmacists’
beliefs. Mitchell et.al[39] reported that 55% of Canadian hospital pharmacists agreed that over-
all, medicinal cannabis was effective. Beliefs were not reported in relation to a specific
indication.
Overall, pharmacists’ self-reported knowledge was quite low.[33, 35, 39] Hwang et.al[33]
reported that pharmacists considered themselves to be lacking knowledge surrounding the
pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of medicinal cannabis. Addition-
ally, legislative and procedural knowledge around prescribing, cultivation and distribution was
also lacking for many pharmacists.[33, 39] With respect to education, 66% and 65% of Cana-
dian hospital pharmacists reported receiving no undergraduate or professional development
respectively on medicinal cannabis.[39] There was a self-reported desire from sampled Minne-
sotan and Australian pharmacists for further education.[33, 35] Finally, pharmacists stated
that a lack of accessible and robust literature was a major limitation such that when faced with
a clinical question, the majority of pharmacists used self-directed online learning to inform
practice.[39]
Pharmacists reported a number of concerns surrounding a lack of quality controlled for-
mulations, the potential for recreational misuse, the possibility for diversion into illicit chan-
nels, psychiatric co-morbidities, and the risk of drug-drug interactions.[33, 35, 39] When
considering overall patient safety, Mitchell et.al[39] reported that 55% of Canadian hospital
pharmacists either disagreed or were unsure whether medicinal cannabis was safe. Moreover,
Hwang et.al[33] reported that 55% of participating pharmacists felt uncomfortable with the
potential link between medicinal cannabis and psychiatric illness.[33]
Nurses combined with other medical and allied health professionals.
Participants
within this pooled sample were largely supportive of medicinal cannabis and although not all
supported the use of medicinal cannabis, very few rejected its clinical utility. Conditional to
the survey questions, these five studies reported: (a) a willingness to help children with cancer
access medicinal cannabis[22], (b) ‘turning a blind eye’ to the unlawful use of medicinal canna-
bis because of a belief in its benefits[43], (c) the belief that medicinal cannabis is useful for
chronic conditions[27], (d) support for the clinical utility of medicinal cannabis[38] and (e)
comfort supporting a patient’s right to access medicinal cannabis.[23]

 Self-perceived knowledge relating to the endocannabinoid system and the pharmacology of
cannabinoids was largely considered poor.[23, 27] Knowledge surrounding procedural aspects
of medicinal cannabis therapy such as dosing, formulation differences, and legislation sur-
rounding access, distribution, and supply was also poor.[22, 23, 27] For many participants, a
major barrier to engagement was a self-perceived lack of knowledge and education surround-
ing medicinal cannabis.[22, 23, 27, 43] Two studies indicated a strong desire for additional
education.[23, 27] Moreover, Balneaves et.al[23] reported that 90% of participants stated they
would feel more comfortable engaging with medicinal cannabis after more education. Carlini
et.al[27] reported the use of news/media and patient experience to inform clinical decisions
where formal education was lacking.[27]
The predominant concerns encountered by this pooled sample were the potential for recre-
ational misuse, psychiatric co-morbidities, the absence of robust clinical guidelines, and the
risk of drug-drug interactions.[22, 23, 27] Additional concerns were raised surrounding the
risks associated with uncontrolled supply.[43] Three studies reported the side effect profile of
medicinal cannabis to be a considerable reason for therapy avoidance.[23, 38, 43] Whereas,
Carlini et.al[27] reported that participants believed serious mental health deterioration could
eventuate from prescriber-initiated medicinal cannabis therapy. This was thought to be a sig-
nificant limitation to its clinical applicability.[27]
Discussion
Principle findings
This systematic review examined health professionals’ beliefs, knowledge and concerns sur-
rounding the delivery medicinal cannabis. The three research questions will now be discussed.
(1) How do health professionals feel about the use of medicinal cannabis in clinical practice?
Defining how health professionals felt about medicinal cannabis lacked consistency across
the included studies. The notion of support for medicinal cannabis was measured using a
number of methods. These included the belief in a prescriber’s right to prescribe medicinal
cannabis, the belief in a patient’s right to obtain medicinal cannabis, and support for the clini-
cal usefulness of medicinal cannabis. Given such a high level of heterogeneity, it is difficult to
consolidate these responses to offer specific answers. More broadly, however, health profes-
sionals were relatively supportive of the use of medicinal cannabis in clinical practice. This
notion was consistent across the three predominant professional populations of medicine,
pharmacy, and nursing. It is worthwhile commenting, however, that although there was a gen-
eral impression of support, this did vary according to publication year, geographical location,
and medical speciality. Primarily, older studies presented health professionals’ views that were
generally less supportive of medicinal cannabis than more recently published studies. Among
other factors, this presents questions around the impact of social influence upon health profes-
sional beliefs. Secondly, support for medicinal cannabis varied between jurisdictions with no
obvious patterns relative to jurisdictional leniency or strictness. These results highlight that the
influence of an individual’s professional environment perhaps needs further investigation.
Finally, health professionals were more likely to show signs of support if they were in a special-
ity field compared with those in general or community practice. This perhaps highlights the
importance of environmental context, but more specifically the importance of one’s self-per-
ceived professional role and identity. Yet, it is important to recognise that there is a fundamen-
tal difference between being supportive of medicinal cannabis and being directly responsible
for its delivery. As such, support for medicinal cannabis should not be seen as willingness to
deliver. More research is required to develop a link between support and willingness.
(2) How knowledgeable are health professionals regarding medicinal cannabis?

 Knowledge was broken down across legislative, and clinical fields. Legislative knowledge
included cultivation, distribution, and patient acquisition. Clinical knowledge included aspects
such as pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of medicinal cannabis as
well as efficacy, dosing, and adverse drug reactions. There was a degree of consistency in the
way these questions were asked with most utilising Likert scales. Yet, the studies included in
this review all measured self-perceived knowledge. Thus, these results do not necessarily offer
a true representation of knowledge, but rather a perception of knowledge that is perhaps influ-
enced by external factors. Self-perceived knowledge was deemed poor across legislative and
clinical fields and this was consistent across medicine, pharmacy, and nursing. In addition to a
universal lack of self-perceived knowledge relating to medicinal cannabis, many health profes-
sionals highlighted the need for further education and easy-to-access information. Where
health professionals deemed evidence-based resources inaccessible, other forms of evidence
where being used to generate knowledge. These included self-directed online learning, the
news/media, and past patient experiences. Interestingly, for many health professionals, support
for medicinal cannabis was reinforced by beliefs about clinical usefulness. Yet, these same par-
ticipants often reported having a self-perceived lack of clinical knowledge. It is then interesting
to question whether beliefs surrounding the benefits of medicinal cannabis are grounded in
evidence or are an artefact of something else.
(3) What concerns exist for health professionals regarding the delivery of medicinal cannabis?
The concerns of health professionals relating to the delivery of medicinal cannabis were
explored using two methods: (a) participants were asked to comment on what their concerns
were, or (b) five-point Likert scales were used to quantify the level of concern for pre-specified
items. Where the former allowed participants to outline what concerns they had, the latter
tended to identify the level of concern for pre-specified concepts. Nevertheless, there was a
high degree of consistency between the concerns that emerged from free-text responses and
those that were assessed using Likert scales. As with both the previous research questions,
there were no major differences across medicine, pharmacy, and nursing. Health professional
concerns were divided into two major categories–concerns for direct patient harm and con-
cern for indirect societal harm. Health professionals were mostly concerned with the risk of
psychiatric adverse drug reactions while generally understating the risks of other adverse drug
reactions. Furthermore, health professionals consistently acknowledged that patients requiring
medicinal cannabis are often those with significant co-morbidities and polypharmacy, and
hence expressed concern regarding the potential for drug-drug interactions. A number of indi-
rect public health concerns emerged as being problematic, but none more than the fear that
cannabis would be obtained ‘medicinally’ as a legal fac
¸ade for recreational use. As above, it is
interesting to view these concerns within the context of a lack of knowledge. While it is hard to
identify whether health professionals are basing their beliefs of direct and indirect conse-
quences on the results of peer-reviewed literature or the negative stigma associated with canna-
bis, what is evident is that health professionals need more guidance.
Implications for research
An interesting additional finding and a limitation to the overall completeness of this review
was a lack of theoretical framing when exploring the factors that underpin the delivery of
medicinal cannabis. It is important to recognise that due to the implicit common-sense models
of behaviour applied, these results are limited to the beliefs, knowledge, and concerns of health
professionals.[47, 48] Not all possible variables have been examined and as such, these results
only convey a partial description of the target behaviour–in this case the, delivery of medicinal
cannabis. Yet, there are attempts to translate these results into intervention strategies without

 fully understanding the nature of the target behaviour in context. For example, Fitzcharles et.al
[32] asked participants about their medicinal cannabis beliefs and knowledge. The authors
concluded that Canadian rheumatologists lacked confidence and competence and given this
uncertainty, participating rheumatologists reported a resistance to authorisation. The authors
suggest additional guidance for the authorisation of medicinal cannabis in the treatment of
rheumatic conditions as a potential intervention to lessen the resistance identified. The authors
provide no consideration for other potentially important variables such as emotional process-
ing, social influence, behavioural regulation, or reinforcement.[49] Without considering the
complete nature of a given behaviour in an appropriate context, any proposed intervention
strategy will seldom be complete or grounded in evidence.
Strengths and limitations
This study was reported according to PRISMA. Furthermore, a pre-specified study protocol
was used which identified all studies discussing health professionals within the context of
delivering medicinal cannabis. The full-text review, data extraction, and bias assessment were
performed by two independent researchers whilst inclusion and exclusion criteria were explicit
and applied uniformly. Nevertheless, unpublished studies or studies indexed in smaller data-
bases could have been missed. Additionally, studies published in a language other than English
will also have been missed. Furthermore, articles indexed as either an abstract, editorial or
opinion piece were intentionally excluded. This decision was made due to the inability to ade-
quately assess methodological quality and perform critical appraisal.
The modified risk of bias tool used to assess the quantitative studies needs to be used within
the context of its limitations. Although modifications were made according to explicit criteria
for the development and reporting of observational, cross-sectional studies, the original tool
was developed for prevalence studies. It was deemed that prevalence studies represented a
closer philosophical resemblance to observational, cross-sectional studies than did interven-
tion studies which is why more established scales such as the Newcastle-Ottawa-Scale and the
Downs and Black checklist were not used. Overall, the probability of bias influencing these
results is considered to be small; however, the potential for publication bias cannot be
completely ignored. It is unlikely that these results will directly inform clinical practice, but
rather the intent is to inform further research exploring the factors that underpin the delivery
of medicinal cannabis.
Conclusion
Through an analysis of the available literature, this systematic review identified three major
points. Primarily, health professionals are relatively supportive of medicinal cannabis in clini-
cal practice, yet this support is often counterbalanced by a lack of confidence, a lack of self-
reported competence, and concerns for the associated risks. Secondly, there was universal self-
reported lack of knowledge regarding legislative and clinical domains. It is unclear what
impact potentially biased information sources are having on the acquisition of knowledge par-
ticularly where robust sources are scarce. Finally, the most concerning direct patient harm of
medicinal cannabis was the risk of psychiatric adverse effects. The most concerning indirect
societal harm was the potential for recreational misuse of medically acquired cannabis. The
comprehensiveness of these results is limited by the use of implicit common-sense models of
behaviour. Before strategies can be are implemented to change health professional behaviour,
a more comprehensive description of the factors that underpin the delivery of medicinal can-
nabis must be sought. Only then can strategies grounded in evidence, be implemented.
