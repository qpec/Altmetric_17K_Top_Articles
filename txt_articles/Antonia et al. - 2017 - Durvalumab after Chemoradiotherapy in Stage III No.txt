also received mycophenolate treatment. IMFINZI was interrupted in five (0.3%) patients and 
discontinued in three (0.2%) patients. Resolution occurred in nine (0.6%) patients. In the combined safety 
database, Grade 3 or 4 elevations in ALT occurred in 40/1342 (3.0%) of patients, AST in 58/1336 (4.3%), 
and total bilirubin in 37/1341 (2.8%) of patients. 
5.3 Immune-Mediated Colitis 
Immune-mediated colitis or diarrhea occurred in patients receiving IMFINZI. Monitor patients for signs 
and symptoms of colitis or diarrhea and manage with treatment modifications, anti-diarrheal agents, and 
corticosteroids [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. 
In Study 1, colitis or diarrhea occurred in 23 (12.6%) patients including Grade 3 or 4 diarrhea in two 
(1.1%) patients. No patients in Study 1 received systemic corticosteroids or immunosuppressants for 
diarrhea or colitis. In the combined safety database, immune-mediated colitis or diarrhea occurred in 18 
(1.3%) patients including Grade 4 in one (<0.1%) and Grade 3 in four (0.3%) patients. The median time 
to onset was 73 days (range: 13-345 days). Of these patients, one (<0.1%) had Grade 4 and four (0.3%) 
had Grade 3 immune-mediated colitis or diarrhea. Ten (0.7%) of the 18 patients received high-dose 
corticosteroid treatment. Two (0.1%) patients received non-steroidal immunosuppressants. IMFINZI was 
interrupted in five (0.4%) patients and discontinued in six (0.4%) patients. Resolution occurred in 11 
(0.8%) patients. 
5.4 Immune-Mediated Endocrinopathies 
Immune-related thyroid disorders, adrenal insufficiency, type 1 diabetes mellitus and 
hypophysitis/hypopituitarism have occurred in patients receiving IMFINZI. Monitor patients for clinical 
signs and symptoms of endocrinopathies. 
Thyroid Disorders 
Monitor thyroid function prior to and periodically during treatment with IMFINZI. Asymptomatic 
patients with abnormal thyroid function tests can receive IMFINZI. Manage patients with abnormal 
thyroid function tests with hormone replacement (if indicated) and treatment modifications [see Dosage 
and Administration (2.2)]. 
6
Reference ID: 4091527 
 In the Study 1, hypothyroidism or thyroiditis leading to hypothyroidism occurred in ten (5.5%) patients. 
All patients had Grade 1-2 hypothyroidism. The median time to first onset was 42 days (range: 15-239). 
Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) was elevated and above the patient’s baseline in 25 (15.3%) of 163 
patients with a follow-up measurement. 
In Study 1, hyperthyroidism or thyroiditis leading to hyperthyroidism occurred in nine (4.9%) patients. 
All patients had Grade 1-2 hyperthyroidism. The median time to first onset was 43 days (range: 14-71). 
Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) was decreased and below the patient’s baseline in 26 (16%) of 163 
patients with a follow-up measurement. 
In the combined safety database, hypothyroidism occurred in 136 (9.6%) patients, while hyperthyroidism 
occurred in 81 (5.7%) patients. Thyroiditis occurred in ten patients, including Grade 3 in one patient who 
had a myocardial infarction. In nine patients with thyroiditis, transient hyperthyroidism preceded 
hypothyroidism. Treatment with a beta-blocker and/or thioamide was administered for hyperthyroidism in 
five of these patients. 
Adrenal Insufficiency 
Monitor patients for clinical signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency. Administer corticosteroids and 
hormone replacement as clinically indicated [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. 
In Study 1, adrenal insufficiency occurred in one (0.5%) patient (Grade 1). In the combined safety 
database, adrenal insufficiency occurred in 13 (0.9%) patients, including Grade 3 in two (0.1%) patients. 
Seven (0.5%) of these patients were treated with systemic corticosteroids. 
Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus 
Monitor patients for hyperglycemia or other signs and symptoms of diabetes. Initiate insulin for type 1 
diabetes mellitus and manage patients with treatment modifications [see Dosage and Administration 
(2.2)]. New onset type 1 diabetes mellitus without an alternative etiology occurred in one patient (<0.1%) 
in the combined safety database. 
Hypophysitis 
Monitor for signs and symptoms of hypophysitis or hypopituitarism. Administer corticosteroids and 
hormone replacement as clinically indicated [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Hypopituitarism 
leading to adrenal insufficiency and diabetes insipidus occurred in one patient (<0.1%) in the combined 
safety database. 
5.5 Other Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions 
IMFINZI has caused immune-mediated rash. Other immune-related adverse reactions, including aseptic 
meningitis, hemolytic anemia, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, myocarditis, myositis, nephritis, and 
ocular inflammatory toxicity including uveitis and keratitis, have occurred in ≤1.0% of patients treated 
with IMFINZI. 
7
Reference ID: 4091527 
  
Immune-mediated Rash 
Monitor for signs and symptoms of rash [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. In Study 1, 20 (11.0%) 
of patients developed rash including Grade 3 rash in one (0.5%) patient. In the combined safety database, 
220 (15.6%) patients developed rash and four (0.3%) patients developed vitiligo. Systemic corticosteroids 
were administered in 17 (1.2%) patients. The rash resolved in 133 (9.4%) patients. 
Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura 
Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of immune thrombocytopenic purpura [see Dosage and 
Administration (2.2)]. In the combined safety database, immune thrombocytopenic purpura led to death in 
one (<0.1%) patient. The patient received high-dose corticosteroids, human immunoglobulin, and 
rituximab. 
Nephritis 
Monitor patients for abnormal renal function tests prior to and each cycle during treatment with IMFINZI 
and manage with treatment modifications and corticosteroids [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. In 
Study 1, one patient received systemic corticosteroids for immune-mediated nephritis. In the combined 
safety database, immune-mediated nephritis occurred in three (0.2%) patients including Grade 3 in two 
(0.1%) patients. All three patients received high-dose corticosteroids treatment. IMFINZI was 
discontinued in all three patients. Resolution occurred in all three patients. 
5.6 Infection 
Severe infections, including sepsis, necrotizing fasciitis, and osteomyelitis, occurred in patients receiving 
IMFINZI. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infection and treat with anti-infectives for 
suspected or confirmed infections. Withhold IMFINZI for ≥Grade 3 infection [see Dosage and 
Administration (2.2) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 
In Study 1, infections occurred in 54 (29.7%) patients. Grade 3 or 4 infection occurred in eleven (6.0%) 
patients, while five (2.7%) patients were experiencing infection at the time of death. Urinary tract 
infections were the most common cause of Grade 3 or higher infection, occurring in eight (4.4%) patients. 
In the combined safety database, infections occurred in 531 (37.6%) patients. 
5.7 Infusion-Related Reactions 
Severe infusion-related reactions have been reported in patients receiving IMFINZI. Monitor for signs 
and symptoms of an infusion-related reaction. Interrupt or slow the rate of infusion in patients with mild 
or moderate infusion reactions. Permanently discontinue IMFINZI in patients with Grade 3 or 4 infusion 
reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. 
Infusion related reactions occurred in three (1.6%) patients in Study 1 and 26 (1.8%) patients in the 
combined safety database. There were five (0.4%) Grade 3 and no Grade 4 or 5 reactions. Four (0.3%) 
patients developed urticaria within 48 hours of dosing. 
8
Reference ID: 4091527 
 5.8 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity 
Based on its mechanism of action and data from animal studies, IMFINZI can cause fetal harm when 
administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies, administration of durvalumab to 
cynomolgus monkeys from the onset of organogenesis through delivery resulted in increased premature 
delivery, fetal loss and premature neonatal death. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. 
Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with IMFINZI 
and for at least 3 months after the last dose of IMFINZI [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)].

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience 
Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in 
the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and 
may not reflect the rates observed in practice. 
The safety data described in Table 2 reflect exposure to IMFINZI in 182 patients with locally advanced or 
metastatic urothelial carcinoma in Study 1 whose disease has progressed during or after one standard 
platinum-based regimen. Patients received 10 mg/kg IMFINZI via intravenous infusion every 2 weeks 
[see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. The median duration of exposure was 10.2 weeks (range: 0.14, 52.4). 
Thirty-one percent (31%) of patients had a drug delay or interruption for an adverse reaction. The most 
common (>2%) were liver injury (4.9%), urinary tract infection (3.3%), acute kidney injury (3.3%), and 
musculoskeletal pain (2.7%). 
The most common adverse reactions (≥15%) were fatigue (39%), musculoskeletal pain (24%), 
constipation (21%), decreased appetite (19%), nausea (16%), peripheral edema (15%) and urinary tract 
infection (15%). The most common Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions (≥3%) were fatigue, urinary tract 
infection, musculoskeletal pain, abdominal pain, dehydration, and general physical health deterioration. 
Eight patients (4.4%) who were treated with IMFINZI experienced Grade 5 adverse events of 
cardiorespiratory arrest, general physical health deterioration, sepsis, ileus, pneumonitis, or immune-

 mediated hepatitis. Three additional patients were experiencing infection and disease progression at the 
time of death. IMFINZI was discontinued for adverse reactions in 3.3% of patients. Serious adverse 
reactions occurred in 46% of patients. The most frequent serious adverse reactions (>2%) were acute 
kidney injury (4.9%), urinary tract infection (4.4%), musculoskeletal pain (4.4%), liver injury (3.3%), 
general physical health deterioration (3.3%), sepsis, abdominal pain, pyrexia/tumor associated fever 
(2.7% each). 
Immune-mediated adverse reactions requiring systemic corticosteroids or hormone replacement therapy 
occurred in 8.2% (15/182) patients, including 5.5% (10/182) patients who required systemic 
corticosteroid therapy and 2.7% (5/182) patients who required only hormone replacement therapy. Seven 
patients (3.8%) received an oral prednisone dose equivalent to >40 mg daily for an immune-mediated 
adverse reaction [see Warnings and Precautions (5)]. 
Table 2 summarizes the adverse reactions that occurred in ≥10% of patients, while Table 3 summarizes 
the Grade 3 - 4 selected laboratory abnormalities that occurred in ≥1% of patients treated with IMFINZI

6.2 Immunogenicity 
As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity. The detection of antibody 
formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed 
incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by 
several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant 
medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to 
IMFINZI to the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading. 
Due to the limitations in assay performance, the incidence of antibody development in patients receiving 
IMFINZI has not been adequately determined. Of 1124 patients who were treated with IMFINZI 10 
mg/kg every 2 weeks and evaluable for the presence of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs), 3.3% patients tested 
positive for treatment-emergent ADAs. The clinical significance of anti-durvalumab antibodies is 
unknown. 
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 
8.1 Pregnancy 
Risk summary 
Based on its mechanism of action and data from animal studies, IMFINZI can cause fetal harm when 
administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)]. There are no data on the use of 
IMFINZI in pregnant women. 
In animal reproduction studies, administration of durvalumab to pregnant cynomolgus monkeys from the 
confirmation of pregnancy through delivery resulted in increased in premature delivery, fetal loss and 
premature neonatal death (see Data). Human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) is known to cross the placental 
barrier; therefore, durvalumab has the potential to be transmitted from the mother to the developing fetus. 
Apprise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. 
In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in 
clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. 
Data 
Animal Data 
As reported in the literature, the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway plays a central role in preserving pregnancy by 
maintaining maternal immune tolerance to the fetus. In mouse allogeneic pregnancy models, disruption of 
PD-L1 signaling was shown to result in an increase in fetal loss. The effects of durvalumab on prenatal 
and postnatal development were evaluated in reproduction studies in cynomolgus monkeys. Durvalumab 
12
Reference ID: 4091527 
 was administered from the confirmation of pregnancy through delivery at exposure levels approximately 
6 to 20 times higher than those observed at the clinical dose of 10 mg/kg of durvalumab (based on AUC). 
Administration of durvalumab resulted in premature delivery, fetal loss (abortion and stillbirth) and 
increase in neonatal deaths. Durvalumab was detected in infant serum on postpartum Day 1, indicating 
the presence of placental transfer of durvalumab. Based on its mechanism of action, fetal exposure to 
durvalumab may increase the risk of developing immune-mediated disorders or altering the normal 
immune response and immune-mediated disorders have been reported in PD-1 knockout mice. 
8.2 Lactation 
Risk Summary 
There is no information regarding the presence of durvalumab in human milk, the effects on the breastfed 
infant, or the effects on milk production. Human IgG1 is excreted in human milk. Durvalumab was 
present in the milk of lactating cynomolgus monkeys and was associated with premature neonatal death 
(see Data). 
Because of the potential for adverse reactions in breastfed infants from durvalumab, advise a lactating 
woman not to breastfeed during treatment with IMFINZI and for at least 3 months after the last dose. 
Data 
In lactating cynomolgus monkeys, durvalumab was present in breast milk at about 0.15% of maternal 
serum concentrations after administration of durvalumab from the confirmation of pregnancy through 
delivery at exposure levels approximately 6 to 20 times higher than those observed at the clinical dose of 
10 mg/kg of durvalumab (based on AUC). Administration of durvalumab resulted in premature neonatal 
death. 
8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential 
Contraception 
Females 
Based on its mechanism of action, IMFINZI can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant 
woman [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective 
contraception during treatment with IMFINZI, and for at least 3 months following the last dose of 
IMFINZI. 
8.4 Pediatric Use 
The safety and effectiveness of IMFINZI have not been established in pediatric patients. 
8.5 Geriatric Use 
Of the 182 patients treated with IMFINZI, 112 patients were 65 years or older and 34 patients were 75 
years or older. The overall response rate in patients 65 years or older was 15.2% (17/112) and was 11.8% 
(4/34) in patients 75 years or older. Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions occurred in 38% (42/112) of patients 
65 years or older and 35% (12/34) of patients 75 years or older. Study results in patients > 65 years of age 
13
Reference ID: 4091527 
 and particularly in those > 75 years of age should be viewed with caution given the small number of 
patients. 
10 OVERDOSAGE 
There is no information on overdose with IMFINZI. 
11 DESCRIPTION 
Durvalumab is a human immunoglobulin G1 kappa (IgG1κ) monoclonal antibody that blocks the 
interaction of programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) with the PD-1 and CD80 (B7.1) molecules. 
Durvalumab is produced by recombinant DNA technology in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell 
suspension culture. 
IMFINZI (durvalumab) Injection for intravenous use is a sterile, preservative-free, clear to opalescent, 
colorless to slightly yellow solution, free from visible particles. 
Each 500 mg vial of IMFINZI contains 500 mg of durvalumab in 10 mL solution. Each mL contains 
durvalumab, 50 mg, L-histidine (2 mg), L-histidine hydrochloride monohydrate (2.7 mg), α,α-trehalose 
dihydrate (104 mg), Polysorbate 80 (0.2 mg), and Water for Injection, USP. 
Each 120 mg vial of IMFINZI contains 120 mg of durvalumab in 2.4 mL solution. Each mL contains 
durvalumab, 50 mg, L-histidine (2 mg), L-histidine hydrochloride monohydrate (2.7 mg), α,α-trehalose 
dihydrate (104 mg), Polysorbate 80 (0.2 mg), and Water for Injection, USP. 
12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 
12.1 Mechanism of Action 
Expression of programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) can be induced by inflammatory signals (e.g., 
IFN-gamma) and can be expressed on both tumor cells and tumor-associated immune cells in the tumor 
microenvironment. PD-L1 blocks T-cell function and activation through interaction with PD-1 and CD80 
(B7.1). By binding to its receptors, PD-L1 reduces cytotoxic T-cell activity, proliferation, and cytokine 
production. 
Durvalumab is a human immunoglobulin G1 kappa (IgG1κ) monoclonal antibody that blocks the 
interaction of PD-L1 with PD-1 and CD80 (B7.1). Blockade of PD-L1/PD-1 and PD-L1/CD80 
interactions releases the inhibition of immune responses, without inducing antibody dependent cell-
mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). 
PD-L1 blockade with durvalumab led to increased T-cell activation in vitro and decreased tumor size in 
co-engrafted human tumor and immune cell xenograft mouse models. 
12.2 Pharmacodynamics 
The exposure-response relationships for efficacy and safety are unknown. 
Cardiac Electrophysiology 
14
Reference ID: 4091527 
 Durvalumab is unlikely to prolong the QT/QTc interval. 
12.3 Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics of durvalumab was studied in 1324 patients with doses ranging from 0.1 mg/kg 
(0.01 times the approved recommended dosage) to 20 mg/kg (2 times the approved recommended dosage) 
administered once every two, three or four weeks. 
PK exposure increased more than dose-proportionally at doses less than 3 mg/kg (0.3 times the approved 
recommended dosage) and dose proportionally at doses greater than or equal to 3 mg/kg. Steady state was 
achieved at approximately 16 weeks. 
Distribution 
The geometric mean (% coefficient of variation [CV%]) steady state volume of distribution was 
5.6 (17%) L. 
Elimination 
Durvalumab clearance decreases over time, with a mean maximal reduction (CV%) from baseline values 
of approximately 22.9% (46.3%) resulting in a geometric mean (CV%) steady state clearance (CLss) of 
8.24 mL/h (37.3%); the decrease in CLss is not considered clinically relevant. The geometric mean 
(CV%) terminal half-life was approximately 17 (23.2%) days. 
Specific Populations 
Age (19–96 years), body weight (34-149 kg), sex, albumin levels, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, 
creatinine levels, soluble PD-L1, tumor type, race, mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance (CLcr) 
60 to 89 mL/min), moderate renal impairment (CLcr 30 to 59 mL/min), mild hepatic impairment 
(bilirubin less than or equal to ULN and AST greater than ULN or bilirubin greater than 1.0 to 1.5 times 
ULN and any AST), or ECOG performance status had no clinically significant effect on the 
pharmacokinetics of durvalumab. 
The effect of severe renal impairment (CLcr 15 to 29 mL/min) or moderate hepatic impairment (bilirubin 
greater than 1.5 to 3.0 times ULN and any AST) or severe hepatic impairment (bilirubin greater than 3.0 
times ULN and any AST) on the pharmacokinetics of durvalumab is unknown. 
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 
13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility 
The carcinogenic and genotoxic potential of durvalumab have not been evaluated. 
Animal fertility studies have not been conducted with durvalumab. In repeat-dose toxicology studies with 
durvalumab in sexually mature cynomolgus monkeys of up to 3 months duration, there were no notable 
effects on the male and female reproductive organs. 
15
Reference ID: 4091527 
 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology 
In animal models, inhibition of PD-L1/PD-1 signaling increased the severity of some infections and 
enhanced inflammatory responses. M. tuberculosis-infected PD-1 knockout mice exhibit markedly 
decreased survival compared with wild-type controls, which correlated with increased bacterial 
proliferation and inflammatory responses in these animals. PD-L1 and PD-1 knockout mice have also 
shown decreased survival following infection with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus. 
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 
14.1 Urothelial Carcinoma 
The efficacy of IMFINZI was evaluated in Study 1, the urothelial cancer cohort of a multicenter, multi-
cohort, open-label clinical trial. In Study 1, 182 patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial 
carcinoma were enrolled. Patients had progressed while on or after a platinum-based therapy, including 
those who progressed within 12 months of receiving therapy in a neo-adjuvant or adjuvant setting. These 
patients had initiated durvalumab therapy at least 13 weeks prior to the data cut-off date. The trial 
excluded patients with a history of immunodeficiency; medical conditions that required systemic 
immunosuppression (not to exceed 10 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent); history of severe autoimmune 
disease; untreated CNS metastases; HIV; active tuberculosis, or hepatitis B or C infection. All patients 
received IMFINZI 10 mg/kg via intravenous infusion every 2 weeks for up to 12 months or until 
unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Tumor assessments were performed at Weeks 6, 12 and 16, 
then every 8 weeks for the first year and every 12 weeks thereafter. The major efficacy outcome measures 
were confirmed Objective Response Rate (ORR) according to RECIST v1.1 as assessed by Blinded 
Independent Central Review (BICR), and duration of response (DoR). 
In Study 1, the median age was 67 years (range: 34 to 88), 72% were male, 64% were Caucasian. 
Sixty-six percent (66%) of patients had visceral metastasis (bone, liver, or lung), including 34% with liver 
metastasis. Lymph node only metastasis were present in 13% of patients. Sixty-six percent (66%) of 
patients had ECOG score of 1 and 41% of patients had a baseline creatinine clearance of <60 mL/min. 
The Bellmunt risk score (which includes ECOG score, baseline hemoglobin, and liver metastases) was 0 
in 23%, 1 in 38%, 2 in 29%, and 3 in 9% of patients. Twenty percent (20%) of patients had disease 
progression following platinum-containing neo-adjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy as their only prior line 
of therapy. Seventy percent (70%) of patients received prior cisplatin, 30% prior carboplatin and 35% 
received ≥2 prior lines of systemic therapy. 
Tumor specimens were evaluated prospectively for PD-L1 expression on tumor cells (TC) and immune 
cells (IC) at a central laboratory using the VENTANA PD-L1 (SP263) Assay. Of the 182 patients, 95 
were classified as PD-L1 high (if ICs involve >1% of the tumor area, TC ≥25% or IC ≥25%; if ICs 
involve ≤1% of the tumor area, TC ≥25% or IC=100%), 73 as PD-L1 low/negative (did not meet criterion 
for PD-L1 high), and samples for 14 patients were not evaluable. 
Table 4 summarizes the results in Study 1. The median follow-up time was 5.6 months. In 37 patients 
who had received only neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy prior to study entry, nine patients (24%) 
responded. 
16
Reference ID: 4091527 
 Among the total 31 responding patients, 14 patients (45%) had ongoing responses of 6 months or longer 
and five patients (16%) had ongoing responses of 12 months or longer.
