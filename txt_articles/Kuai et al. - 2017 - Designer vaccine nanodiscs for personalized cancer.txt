Abstract
Despite the tremendous potential of peptide-based cancer vaccines, their efficacy has been limited 
in humans. Recent innovations in tumor exome sequencing have signaled the new era of 
personalized immunotherapy with patient-specific neo-antigens, but a general methodology for 
stimulating strong CD8α+ cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) responses remains lacking. Here we 
demonstrate that high density lipoprotein-mimicking nanodiscs coupled with antigen (Ag) 
peptides and adjuvants can markedly improve Ag/adjuvant co-delivery to lymphoid organs and 
sustain Ag presentation on dendritic cells. Strikingly, nanodiscs elicited up to 47-fold greater 
frequencies of neoantigen-specific CTLs than soluble vaccines and even 31-fold greater than 
perhaps the strongest adjuvant in clinical trials (i.e. CpG in Montanide). Moreover, multi-epitope 
vaccination generated broad-spectrum T-cell responses that potently inhibited tumor growth. 
Nanodiscs eliminated established MC-38 and B16F10 tumors when combined with anti-PD-1 and 
anti-CTLA-4 therapy. These findings represent a new powerful approach for cancer 
immunotherapy and suggest a general strategy for personalized nanomedicine.
Peptide-based cancer vaccines have been extensively investigated due to their good safety 
profiles and ease of manufacturing and quality control. However, their anti-tumor efficacy in

 clinical trials has been disappointing, a phenomenon that has been attributed to inefficient 
co-delivery of Ag peptides and adjuvants to draining lymph nodes (dLNs), and subsequent 
immunological tolerance and CTL fratricide1. Although depot-forming water-in-oil adjuvant 
systems can improve immunogenicity2,3, booster immunizations can cause T-cell 
sequestration at the vaccine site, leading to T-cell exhaustion and deletion4. To address these 
issues, various nano-vaccine systems have been evaluated in animal models with varying 
degrees of success5-15. Despite the progress in the field, potential safety concerns and scale-
up manufacturing of nanoparticles, especially in a manner suitable for personalized 
therapeutics with patient-specific neo-antigens, still remain as the major challenges.
Here we propose an alternative, simple strategy where preformed nanocarriers, with an 
established clinical manufacturing procedure and excellent safety profiles in humans, are 
mixed with adjuvants and Ag peptides, including tumor-specific mutant neo-epitopes16-19, to 
produce personalized cancer vaccines (Fig. 1). Our strategy is based on synthetic high 
density lipoprotein (sHDL) nanodiscs, composed of phospholipids and apolipoprotein A1 
(ApoA1)-mimetic peptides. Compared with other HDLs containing 243-amino acid ApoA1 
purified from human plasma or produced recombinantly20-22, sHDL nanodiscs are 
synthesized with 22-mer peptides (22A), derived from the repeat α-helix domain of 
ApoA123, with no sequence homology to endogenous ApoA1, thus averting potential trigger 
of autoimmunity. Importantly, sHDL has been previously manufactured for clinical testing 
and proven to be safe in humans with the maximum tolerated dose at ~2.2 g/m2,24-26 a value 
one- to two-orders of magnitude greater than most polymeric or inorganic nanoparticles in 
clinical trials27,28.
Here we set out to develop a nanodisc-based platform for neo-antigen vaccination (Fig. 1). 
Exploiting the endogenous role of HDL as a nanocarrier for cholesterol, we modified a 
commonly used oligonucleotide containing 5'-C-phosphate-G-3' (CpG) motif, a potent Toll-
like receptor-9 agonist, with cholesterol (Cho-CpG) to enhance its in vivo trafficking. We 
show that preformed sHDL nanodiscs can be simply mixed with cholesteryl-CpG and tumor 
Ag peptides, including neo-antigens identified via tumor DNA sequencing, to produce 
homogeneous, stable, and ultrasmall nanodiscs in less than two hours at room temperature 
(RT). The nanodiscs promote co-delivery of Ag/CpG to dLNs; prolong Ag presentation on 
antigen-presenting cells (APCs); elicit striking levels of broad-spectrum antitumor T-cell 
responses that significantly inhibit tumor growth; and eradicate established tumors when 
combined with immune checkpoint blockade. Based on the facile production process, robust 
therapeutic efficacy, and clinical safety demonstrated previously24,25, our approach offers an 
attractive platform technology for patient-tailored cancer vaccines as well as other bioactive 
therapeutics.
Engineering nanodiscs for antigen and adjuvant delivery
We first identified lipids and peptides conducive to nanodisc formation. DMPC lipid films 
were hydrated and added with a series of ApoA1-mimetic peptides, followed by thermal 
cycling between 50 °C and 4 °C. We identified a subset of peptides, including 22A and D-
amino acids of 22A, that produced clear sHDL suspensions, stable for one month when 
stored at 4°C (Supplementary Fig. 1a). In addition, use of phospholipids with transition

 temperature (Tm) below RT (e.g. POPC and DOPC with Tm = −2°C and −17°C, 
respectively) produced murky liposomal suspension, whereas lipids with high Tm (e.g. 
DPPC and DMPC with Tm = 41°C and 24°C, respectively) formed clear sHDL suspensions 
in the presence of 22A (Supplementary Fig. 1b), showing flexibility in the materials 
design. Based on their size, homogeneity, and long-term stability, we chose to further 
investigate 22A and DMPC as the key components of nanodisc vaccines.
To achieve intracellular release of Ag within APCs via reduction-sensitive conjugation of Ag 
on sHDL, we synthesized dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-[3-(2-
pyridyldithio) propionate] (PDP, Supplementary Fig. 2) and incorporated PDP into sHDL 
(4 mol%). When incubated for 30 min at RT with Ag peptides modified with a cysteine-
serine-serine (CSS) linker29, sHDL nanodiscs were efficiently surface-decorated with 
various Ag peptides (e.g., OVA257-264, a model CD8α+ T-cell epitope Ag from ovalbumin; 
and Adgpk, neo-antigen in MC-38), and subsequent incubation with Cho-CpG for 30 min at 
RT led to almost complete (~98%) insertion of CpG into sHDL, producing nanodiscs co-
loaded with Ag and CpG (termed sHDL-Ag/CpG, with ~6.5 Ag peptides and ~1 CpG 
molecule per nanodisc, Supplementary Fig. 3, Supplementary Table 1). sHDL-Ag/CpG 
exhibited uniform disc-like morphology with an average diameter of 10.5 ± 0.5 nm and 
polydispersity index of 0.20 ± 0.02 (Fig. 2a,b). Importantly, sHDL-Ag/CpG could be readily 
sterile-filtered and stored frozen at −20 °C for at least 8 weeks before thawing at 37 °C, 
without negatively affecting its homogeneity (Fig. 2c).
Sustained antigen presentation and cross-priming of T-cells
We next examined the impact of nanodiscs on Ag presentation. Bone marrow derived 
dendritic cells (BMDCs) pulsed for 24 h with sHDL-CSSSIINFEKL/CpG presented 
OVA257-264 SIINFEKL with a greater efficiency than BMDCs treated with free Ag peptides 
admixed with CpG or sHDL-CSSSIINFEKL, as determined by staining DCs with the 25-
D1.16 mAb directed against SIINFEKL-H-2Kb complexes (Fig. 2d, Supplementary Fig. 
4a,b). Interestingly, DCs pulsed with free SIINFEKL+CpG efficiently presented Ag for the 
first 6 h of incubation, but Ag presentation decreased precipitously past 6 h (Fig. 2e,f, 
Supplementary Fig. 4c), suggesting initial direct Ag binding to MHC-I molecules, followed 
by rapid Ag degradation or disassociation. In contrast, Ag presentation with sHDL-Ag/CpG 
gradually increased over time, achieving ~9-fold greater levels at 24 h and maintaining ~4-
fold higher levels even at 48 h, compared with free SIINFEKL+CpG.
Intrigued by prolonged Ag presentation, we investigated the process of nanodisc uptake and 
Ag localization using CSS-SIINFEK(FITC)L; SIINFEKL modified with FITC at ε-amino 
group in the lysine residue is known to retain its binding capacity to H-2Kb molecules30. 
JAWSII cells (immortalized immature DCs) incubated with free Ag(FITC)+CpG displayed 
weak fluorescence signal on the plasma membrane at 6 h, and only dim fluorescence was 
observed by 24 h (Fig. 2g, Supplementary Fig. 5). In stark contrast, sHDL-Ag(FITC)/CpG 
treatment led to strong FITC signal co-localized with endosomes/lysosomes by 6 h, and 
robust Ag(FITC) signal was detected on cell membranes by 24 h and sustained up to 48 h. In 
addition, nanodiscs containing Rh-PE or Texas Red-labeled-22A were predominantly found 
within endosomes/lysosomes, indicating cellular uptake of intact whole nanodiscs

 (Supplementary Fig. 6). To assess the impact of prolonged Ag presentation on T-cell cross-
priming, we treated BMDCs with free Ag peptides+CpG or sHDL-Ag/CpG for 24 or 48 h, 
and then added SIINFEKL-specific, H-2Kb-restricted B3Z T-cell hybridomas. BMDCs 
pulsed with sHDL-Ag/CpG promoted strong B3Z T-cell activation even after 48 h 
incubation, whereas free Ag peptides+CpG induced minimal B3Z T-cell activation beyond 
the 24 h period (Fig. 2h). Moreover, sHDL-Ag/CpG potently stimulated DC maturation 
(Supplementary Fig. 7). Altogether, whereas free Ag peptide was rapidly loaded and 
dissociated from MHC-I molecules on cell membranes, nanodiscs facilitated intracellular 
delivery of Ag/CpG and mediated their sustained release within endosomes/lysosomes, 
thereby promoting durable Ag presentation, APC maturation, and cross-priming CD8α+ T-
cells in vitro.
Elicitation of robust, long-lived T-cells responses in vivo
We next investigated the impact of nanodiscs on lymphatic delivery of Ag/CpG and 
induction of CD8α+ T-cell responses in vivo5. C57BL/6 mice injected subcutaneously at tail 
base with 31 nmol free CSS-SIINFEK(FITC)L had minimal FITC signal in inguinal dLNs 
after 1 day (Fig. 3a), potentially due to systemic dissemination of small MW Ag peptide or 
direct Ag binding on non-APCs at the injection site1. In contrast, sHDL-Ag group exhibited 
markedly increased FITC signal in dLNs (p < 0.01, Fig. 3a), with Ag(FITC) and Cy5-tagged 
22A co-localized within dLNs (Supplementary Fig. 8). Similarly, injection of 2.3 nmol 
Cy5-tagged Cho-CpG in sHDL increased its LN accumulation, compared with injection in 
free soluble form (p < 0.01, Fig. 3b). These results showed that sHDL nanodisc promoted 
co-delivery of Ag and CpG to dLNs. We next immunized C57BL/6 mice with 15.5 nmol Ag 
and 2.3 nmol CpG (non-fluorophore tagged), and peripheral blood was analyzed for the 
frequency of SIINFEKL–MHC-I tetramer+ CD8α+ T-cells. The mixture of free Ag peptides 
(SIINFEKL or CSS-SIINFEKL) and CpG induced 1-3% Ag-specific CTLs after the third 
immunization (Fig. 3c,d). As the benchmark, we also vaccinated animals with the equivalent 
doses of Ag and CpG emulsified in water-in-oil Montanide, which is arguably one of the 
strongest adjuvant systems in clinical trials for peptide-based cancer vaccines2,3,31,32. Ag
+CpG+Montanide elicited ~2% Ag-specific CTLs after priming; however, no further T-cell 
expansion was observed even after the third immunization, consistent with a recent study 
reporting dysfunction and deletion of high-avidity T-cells after repeated immunizations with 
a depot-forming water-in-oil adjuvant4. In contrast, sHDL-Ag/CpG group elicited a peak 
frequency of ~21% Ag-specific CD8α+ T-cells after the third vaccination (p < 0.0001, Fig. 
3c,d). We observed similar levels of peak Ag-specific CTL responses after sHDL-Ag/CpG 
vaccination with the dosing intervals of 1, 2, or 3 weeks (Supplementary Fig. 9). When 
challenged with 2×105 B16OVA cells, mice immunized with sHDL-Ag/CpG had no 
detectable tumor masses up to 28 days, whereas mice immunized with free Ag peptides
+CpG or Ag+CpG+Montanide all succumbed to tumors with marginal survival benefits 
(Fig. 3e, Supplementary Fig. 10). Importantly, throughout our studies, we did not observe 
any signs of toxicity, autoimmunity, nor immune responses directed against the ApoA1-
mimetic peptide 22A in animals immunized multiple times with sHDL-Ag/CpG 
(Supplementary Fig. 11).

 We sought to rule out the possibility that CSS-modified peptides or Cho-CpG dissociated 
from sHDL-Ag/CpG in vivo were responsible for the strong CTL responses. Introducing the 
CSS linker to SIINFEKL and replacing free CpG with Cho-CpG in free soluble form 
resulted in minimal T-cell responses, and the physical mixture of Ag, CpG, and sHDL also 
elicited weak CTL responses (Fig. 3f). In contrast, sHDL-Ag/CpG nanodiscs drastically 
improved CD8α+ T-cell responses, eliciting remarkable 41-fold greater frequency of Ag-
specific CD8α+ T-cells than CSSSINFEKL+Cho-CpG group (day 35, p < 0.0001), with 
CTLs primarily exhibiting CD44highCD62Llow effector phenotype and robust IFN-γ+ 
ELISPOT responses (Fig. 3f,g, Supplementary Fig. 12). We also examined the durability of 
T-cell responses; after achieving their peak ~30% responses, animals still maintained 10% 
Ag-specific CD8α+ T-cells at 2 months post the last vaccination (20-fold greater than free 
Ag+CpG group, p < 0.001, Fig. 3h), and efficiently eliminated B16OVA cells inoculated 
intravenously (Fig. 3i), demonstrating long-lived protection against tumor challenge. In 
contrast, the soluble vaccine failed to protect animals against the intravenous B16OVA 
challenge.
Tumor regression by combination neo-antigen immunotherapy
To demonstrate the utility of our platform technology for vaccination against neo-antigens, 
we first employed the murine MC-38 colon carcinoma model recently reported to harbor a 
single-epitope mutation within Adpgk protein (ASMTNRELM → ASMTNMELM), with 
the neo-epitope presented in MHC-I H-2Db molecules16. We confirmed the Adpgk neo-
antigen mutation in MC-38 cells by cDNA sequencing (Fig. 4a, Supplementary Fig. 13) 
and synthesized sHDL-Adpgk/CpG by mixing nanodiscs with the neo-epitope modified with 
the CSS-linker and Cho-CpG. C57BL/6 mice immunized with sHDL-Adpgk/CpG generated 
remarkable 47-fold and 31-fold greater frequencies of neoantigen-specific CTLs, compared 
with the soluble Adpgk+CpG and Adpgk+CpG+Montanide groups, respectively (p < 
0.0001, Fig. 4b,c), with tumor-specific cytotoxicity against MC-38 target cells 
(Supplementary Fig. 14) and long-lived T-cell responses, as in the case of sHDL-
SIINFEKL/CpG vaccination (Fig. 4d). To investigate the therapeutic efficacy of nanodisc 
vaccination, C57BL/6 mice were inoculated subcutaneously with 105 MC-38 cells and 
treated with 15.5 nmol Adpgk and 2.3 nmol CpG (Fig. 4e). Therapeutic vaccination with 
sHDL-Adpgk/CpG induced polyfunctional IFN-γ+ and IFN-γ+TNF-α+ Adpgk-specific 
CD8α+ T-cells and substantially slowed MC-38 tumor growth (Fig. 4e), compared with the 
traditional soluble Adpgk+CpG vaccine. However, no tumor rejection was observed in either 
vaccine groups, potentially due to immunosuppression within tumor microenvironment, as 
we detected high expression levels of programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) and its ligand PD-L1 
among tumor-infiltrating CD8α+ T-cells and tumor cells, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 
15). In order to block the immunosuppressive PD-1/PD-L1 pathway33,34, we combined the 
vaccines with anti-PD-1 antibodies (αPD-1). Combination immunotherapy with sHDL-
Adpgk/CpG and αPD-1 treatment generated robust neoantigen-specific CTL responses and 
led to complete tumor regression in ~88% mice (Fig. 4f, Supplementary Fig. 16), 
compared with ~25% rate of tumor regression in the soluble Adpgk+CpG+αPD-1 group. 
Notably, 100% of surviving mice rejected the subsequent re-challenge with MC-38 cells

 inoculated at the contralateral flank on day 70, indicating immunological memory against 
tumor recurrence (data not shown).
Multi-epitope T-cell responses with cocktail nanodiscs
Finally, we evaluated our nanodisc platform in a melanoma model with B16F10 cells, as 
they are highly aggressive, poorly immunogenic, and hence hard to treat with conventional 
cancer vaccines. To prevent tumor immune escape by loss of a single mutant allele35, we 
sought to elicit broad-spectrum T-cell responses by employing multiple antigens (multiAgs), 
including recently reported B16F10 mutated neo-epitopes (MHC I-restricted M27 and MHC 
II-restricted M30) as well as MHC I-restricted epitope from tyrosinase-related protein 2 
(TRP2, a melanoma-associated Ag), all loaded in the same nanodiscs. C57BL/6 mice 
inoculated subcutaneously with 105 B16F10 cells were vaccinated with sHDL-multiAgs/
CpG, eliciting a total of ~30% Ag-specific, IFN-γ+ CD8α+ and CD4+ T-cells in peripheral 
blood, compared with only 1-3% induced by the soluble multiAgs+CpG or multiAgs+CpG
+Montanide groups (p < 0.0001, Fig. 5a, Supplementary Fig. 17). Vaccination with sHDL-
multiAgs/CpG significantly inhibited B16F10 tumor growth, compared with the soluble or 
Montanide vaccines (p < 0.0001, Fig. 5b). Notably, removing either M27/M30 or TRP2 
from sHDL-multiAgs/CpG compromised its therapeutic efficacy, suggesting the benefits of 
broad CTL responses against neo-antigens and tumor-associated antigens (Fig. 5c). Lastly, 
we evaluated sHDL-multiAgs/CpG combined with dual immune checkpoint inhibitors. 
Combination immunotherapy with sHDL-multiAgs/CpG and αPD-1/αCTLA-4 treatment 
led to an impressive rate of B16F10 tumor rejection with ~90% of mice free of tumor, 
whereas the soluble multiAgs+CpG+αPD-1/αCTLA-4 treatment mediated tumor regression 
in ~38% of animals (Fig. 5d).
Overall, our results have significant clinical importance since these nanodiscs, with an 
established manufacturing procedure suited for neo-antigen vaccination and excellent safety 
profiles in humans, can drastically improve co-delivery of antigens and adjuvants to LNs 
(Fig. 3a,b); sustain antigen presentation on DCs and cross-priming of T-cells (Fig. 2e-h); 
drive multivalent CD8α+ and CD4+ T-cell immunity against neo-antigens and tumor-
associated antigens (Fig. 3c-g, Fig. 4b-e, Fig. 5a) with long-term T-cell response (Fig. 3h,i); 
and significantly delay tumor growth in the setting of therapeutic vaccination (Fig. 4e, Fig. 
5b,c). However, despite strong anti-tumor T-cell responses, nanodiscs administered as a 
monotherapy failed to eliminate tumors, possibly due to the immunosuppressive PD-L1/
PD-1 pathway within the tumor microenvironment (Supplementary Fig. 15). Aiming to 
unleash the full cytotoxic potential of T-cells33,34, we combined nanodisc vaccination with 
immune checkpoint inhibitors, achieving potently amplified therapeutic efficacy and 
eradication of MC-38 and B16F10 tumors in > 85% of animals (Fig. 4f, Fig. 5d). Although 
other nanosystems in the literature5-15 may be also applicable, this is, to the best of our 
knowledge, the first demonstration of antitumor efficacy with personalized nanomedicine 
tailored with tumor-specific neo-antigens.
While the work presented here provides the framework for future clinical translation, our 
strategy designed to generate neoantigen-specific cellular immunity requires tumor 
DNA/RNA exome sequencing, identification of neo-antigens, and production of nanodiscs,

 followed by a multi-dose vaccine regimen, which collectively may protract the time window 
required for control of malignancies for late-stage patients. These issues may be tackled in 
the future by multi-thronged strategies that exploit combined immunotherapy targeted to 
humoral and innate arms of immunity36 or radiation therapy37 and select 
chemotherapeutics38 known to delay tumor growth and synergize with T-cell vaccines.
In conclusion, we have developed a new nano-vaccine system ideally suited for 
individualized neo-epitope vaccination and demonstrated their potency to generate broad-
spectrum T-cell responses with striking therapeutic efficacy when combined with immune 
checkpoint inhibitors. As the majority of somatic mutations in cancer cells are unique to 
each patient, cancer vaccines would require a personalized approach16-19. Coupled with the 
recent biomedical breakthroughs in neo-antigen screening and immune checkpoint 
blockade33,34,39-41, our approach may offer a powerful yet facile strategy for producing 
cancer vaccines designed for each patient. Furthermore, this platform technology may be 
generally applicable for personalized therapeutics with a wide range of bioactive molecules 
and imaging agents.
METHODS
Synthesis and characterization of sHDL nanodiscs
Dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-[3-(2-pyridyldithio) propionate] (DOPE-
PDP) was synthesized as reported previously42. DMPC and DOPE-PDP (molar ratio = 96:4) 
were dissolved in chloroform. The mixture was dried with nitrogen flow and placed under 
vacuum for at least 1 h. The resulting lipid film was hydrated in 10 mM sodium phosphate 
buffer and sonicated in a bath sonicator for 10 min, followed by probe sonication for another 
2.5 min. ApoA1 mimetic peptide 22A dissolved in endotoxin free water was added to the 
above mixture (22A:lipids = 1:7.5 molar ratio), which was then subjected to three heating 
and cooling cycles to obtain sHDL. To conjugate tumor antigen peptides to sHDL, cysteine 
terminated tumor antigen peptides were added to the above sHDL (antigen peptide:DOPE-
PDP = 2.5:1, molar ratio) and incubated at room temperature with gentle shaking on an 
orbital shaker. To construct sHDL nanodiscs with multi-antigens, each antigen peptide was 
reacted with DOPE-PDP (antigen peptide:DOPE-PDP = 1.5:1, molar ratio) for 1 h in 
dimethylformamide (DMF), which was removed by freeze-drying after dilution with 
endotoxin-free water. The lipid-peptide conjugates were added to pre-formed sHDL and 
incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Unreacted tumor antigen peptides were removed 
by using Zeba Spin Desalting columns (Pierce). Antigen peptides used in our studies include 
OVA257-264 SIINFEKL, CSSSIINFEKL, CSSSIINFEK(FITC)L, TRP2180-188 
SVYDFFVWL, CSVYDFFVWL, M27 neo-epitope LCPGNKYEM, M30 neo-epitope 
CSSVDWENVSPELNSTDQ, Adpgk mutant peptide ASMTNMELM (all obtained from 
GenScript Corp., Piscataway, NJ), and CSSASMENMELM (from AnaSpec, Fremont, CA). 
The conjugation efficiency of tumor antigen peptides was calculated based on the decrease 
of absorbance signal associated with DOPE-PDP as determined by HPLC. The loading 
efficiency of tumor antigen peptides in sHDL was confirmed by using FITC-labeled peptides 
and measuring the fluorescence intensity of sHDL formulations at Ex = 490 nm and Em = 
520 nm after dissolving the formulations in PBS containing 1% Triton X-100. To load CpG

 in sHDL, different concentrations (0-200 μg/mL) of cholesterol modified CpG 1826 (Cho-
CpG, Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA) were incubated with sHDL at room 
temperature with gentle shaking on an orbital shaker. The amount of CpG incorporated into 
sHDL and free CpG was analyzed by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) equipped with 
TSKgel G2000SWxl column (7.8 mm ID × 30 cm, Tosoh Bioscience LLC). The sHDL 
formulations were diluted to 0.5 mg/mL 22A with PBS, and the particle sizes were 
measured by dynamic light scattering (DLS, Zetasizer Nano ZSP, Malvern, UK). The 
morphology of sHDL was observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) after 
proper dilution of the original samples with 1% uranyl acetate solution negative staining. All 
images were acquired on JEM 1200EX electron microscope (JEOL USA, Peabody, MA) 
equipped with an AMT XR-60 digital camera (Advanced Microscopy Techniques Corp. 
Woburn, MA).
BMDC activation, antigen presentation, and cross-priming
BMDCs were prepared as described previously43. Immature BMDCs were plated at 1×106 
cells/well in 12-well plates. After 24 h, BMDCs were incubated with 75 nM CpG and/or 500 
nM antigen peptide in various formulations or 0.5 μg/mL LPS (positive control) in complete 
media for different lengths of time (2, 6, 24, and 48 h) at 37 °C with 5% CO2. BMDCs were 
harvested, washed with FACS buffer (1% BSA in PBS), incubated with anti-CD16/32 at 
room temperature, and then stained on ice with fluorophore-labeled antibodies against 
CD11c, CD40, CD80, and CD86, or PE-conjugated anti-mouse SIINFEKL/H-2Kb mAb 25-
D1.16 (eBioscience, San Diego, CA). Cells were then washed twice by FACS buffer, 
resuspended in 2 μg/ml DAPI solution, and analyzed by flow cytometry (Cyan 5, Beckman 
Coulter, USA). To assess cross-priming of T-cells, BMDCs were incubated with different 
formulations of SIINFEKL (20, 100 and 500 nM) and CpG (3, 15, and 75 nM) for 24 h or 
48 h at 37 °C. Cells were then carefully washed 3 times with PBS, and 105 B3Z CD8+ T 
hybridoma cells (kindly provided by Dr. N. Shastri) per well were added in RPMI 1640 
supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 55 μM β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM 
pyruvate, 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 μg/mL streptomycin. Throughout the studies, all 
cells were used as received and tested negative for mycoplasma contamination and rodent 
pathogens. After 24 hr of incubation, the media were aspirated, and 150 μL CPRG/lysis 
buffer (0.15 mM chlorophenol red- β-D-galactopyranoside (CPRG), 0.1% Triton-X 100, 9 
mM MgCl2, 100 μM mercaptoethanol in PBS) was added. The plates were incubated at 
37 °C in the dark for 90 min, after which the absorbance of released chlorophenol red was 
measured at 570 nm using a microplate reader. To visualize intracellular distribution of 
nanodiscs, JAWSII cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were seeded at 1×106 cells on 35 mm petri 
dishes (MatTek Corp., Ashland, MA) and incubated with the physical mixture of free 
CSSSIINFEK(FITC)L and CpG, or sHDL-CSSSIINFEK(FITC)L/CpG for different lengths 
of time (6, 24, and 48 h). Cells were then washed 3 times with PBS and incubated for 30 
min at 37 °C with 50 nM LysoTracker® Red DND-99 (Invitrogen) and 2 μg/mL Hoechst in 
phenol/serum-free media to stain lysosomes and nuclei, respectively. In some studies, the 
lipid layers of sHDL were incorporated with 0.5 mol % DOPE-Rhod and 22A peptide of 
sHDL was labeled by incubating pre-formed sHDL with Texas Red®-X succinimidyl ester 
(Life Technologies). JAWSII cells were then imaged using a confocal microscope (Nikon 
A1).

 In vivo immunization and cancer immunotherapy studies
Animals were cared for following federal, state, and local guidelines. All work performed on 
animals was in accordance with and approved by University Committee on Use and Care of 
Animals (UCUCA) at University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. Female C57BL/6 mice of age 6–
8 weeks (Harlan Laboratories) were immunized with different formulations containing 
antigen peptides (15.5 nmol/mouse) and CpG (2.3 nmol/mouse) in 100 μl volume by 
subcutaneous injection at the tail base on indicated time points. In some studies, antigen 
peptide and CpG emulsified in Montanide served as a positive control. Briefly, antigen 
peptide (155 nmol) and CpG (23 nmol) in 0.5 mL PBS were thoroughly emulsified in 0.5 
mL Montanide until the mixture was homogeneous and administered subcutaneously in 100 
μl injection volume. For lymph node draining studies, C57BL/6 mice were injected with free 
CSSSIINFEK(FITC)L, sHDL-CSSSIINFEK(FITC)L, free Cho-CpG(Cy5), or sHDL-Cho-
CpG(Cy5). After 24 h, inguinal lymph nodes were harvested, and FITC or Cy5 fluorescence 
signal was measured with IVIS optical imaging system (Caliper Life Sciences). In some 
studies, induction of IgG response against 22A peptide was assessed by ELISA on immune 
sera as described previously44. The highest dilution with twice the absorbance of 
background was considered as the end-point dilution titer.
For prophylactic tumor challenge studies, vaccinated animals were challenged on day 8 after 
last immunization by subcutaneous injection of 2×105 B16OVA cells (kindly provided by 
Dr. Kenneth Rock) per mouse on the right flank. Tumor growth was monitored every other 
day, and the tumor volume throughout this study was calculated by the following equation45: 
tumor volume = length × width2 × 0.52. Animals were euthanized when the tumor masses 
reached 1.5 cm in diameter or when animals became moribund with severe weight loss or 
ulceration. For the lung metastasis model, vaccinated animals were challenged by 
intravenous injection of 5×104 B16OVA cells/mouse, and lungs excised on day 20 were 
stained in Fekete’s solution, followed by enumeration of B16OVA lung tumor nodules. For 
therapeutic tumor vaccination studies, C57BL/6 mice were inoculated with 1×105 MC38 
(kindly provided by Dr. Weiping Zou) or B16F10 cells (ATCC) per mouse on the right flank 
by subcutaneous injection on day 0 and vaccinated on indicated days. For the combinatorial 
immunotherapy, anti-mouse PD-1 (100 μg/mouse, clone:RMP1-14, BioXcell, West 
Lebanon, NH) and/or anti-mouse CTLA-4 (100 μg/mouse, clone:9D9, BioXcell) antibodies 
were administered intraperitoneally on days 1 and 4 after each vaccination. Tumor growth 
was monitored as indicated above.
Phenotypic and functional assessment of T-cells
Immunized mice were analyzed for the percentages of tumor antigen-specific CD8α+ T 
cells using the tetramer staining assay as described previously46,47 with peptide-MHC 
tetramer tagged with PE (e.g. H-2Kb-restricted SIINFEKL (Beckman Coulter) or H-2Db-
restricted ASMTNMELM (the NIH Tetramer Core Facility, Atlanta, GA)). CTL cytotoxicity 
was evaluated using the Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) Assay (CytoTox 96® Non-
Radioactive Cytotoxicity Assay) in vitro with splenocytes from immunized mice and MC-38 
target cells, as described previously48,49. ELISPOT assay was performed with splenocytes 
from immunized mice as described previously50. The intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) 
assays on PBMCs were performed with anti-IFN-γ-PE and anti-TNF-α-FITC as described

 previously6. For analysis of tumor-infiltrating T-cells, tumor tissues were excised at 
indicated time points, cut into small pieces of 2-4 mm, and then placed in dissociation buffer 
(1 mg/mL of collagenase type IV and 0.1 mg/mL of DNase I in RPMI) for 30 min at 37 °C 
with gentle shaking. The cell suspension was passed through a 70-μm strainer, washed with 
FACS buffer, stained with indicated antibodies, followed by flow cytometric analysis.
cDNA sequencing of neo-epitope (Adpgk) in MC-38 cells
Total RNA was extracted from MC-38 cells by the RNeasy® mini Kit (QIAGEN) following 
the manufacturer’s instructions. The first-strand cDNA was synthesized using 1 μg of total 
RNA with the SuperScript™ III First-Strand Synthesis SuperMix Kit (Invitrogen). Adpgk 
cDNA with lengths of 250 bp and 485 bp were selectively amplified by using the following 
two sets of sequence specific primers. Primer 1: TGCCAACCGCTTCATCTTCT (forward 
primer) and GGTAGACCAGCGTGTGGAAA (reverse primer); Primer 2: 
CTCCAACGGGGCCATGAATA (forward primer) and CGTGGGAAAGACCTGCTGAT 
(reverse primer). The amplification was performed using the SuperScript One Step RT-PCR 
System (Invitrogen). The final cDNA products were visualized in 1.5% agarose gels with 
ethidium bromide, and the Adpgk cDNA bands were cut and purified using the PureLink® 
Quick Gel Extraction and PCR Purification Combo Kit (Invitrogen). The purified cDNA was 
sequenced by the Sanger sequencing method at the University of Michigan DNA 
Sequencing Core.
Statistical analysis
Sample sizes were chosen based on preliminary data from pilot experiments and previously 
published results in the literature. All animal studies were performed after randomization. 
Experiments were not performed in a blinded fashion. Data were analyzed by one- or two-
way analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by Bonferroni post hoc test for comparison of 
multiple groups with Prism 5.0 (GraphPad Software). Data were normally distributed and 
variance between groups was similar. P values less than 0.05 were considered statistically 
significant. All values are reported as means ± SD with the indicated sample size. No 
samples were excluded from analysis.

 Figure 1. Design of sHDL nanodisc platform for personalized cancer vaccines
a, sHDL nanodiscs, composed of phospholipids and apolipoprotein-1 mimetic peptides 
(22A), are engineered for co-delivery of antigen (Ag) peptides and adjuvants. Pre-formed 
sHDL nanodiscs displaying 4 mol% DOPE-PDP are mixed with cysteine-modified Ag 
peptides, including tumor-specific mutated neo-antigens identified via tumor exome DNA 
sequencing, and subsequent incubation with cholesterol-modified immunostimulatory 
molecules (Cho-CpG) leads to formation of sHDL nanodiscs co-loaded with Ag and CpG 
(sHDL-Ag/CpG). b, Upon administration, sHDL nanodiscs efficiently co-deliver Ag and 
CpG to draining lymph nodes, promote strong and durable Ag presentation by dendritic cells 
(DCs) (Signal 1), and induce DC maturation (Signal 2), resulting in elicitation of robust Ag-
specific CD8α+ cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses. Activated CTLs recognize and 
kill their target cancer cells in peripheral tissues and exert strong anti-tumor efficacy. 
Combination immunotherapy with immune checkpoint blockade further amplifies the 
potency of nanodisc vaccination, leading to elimination of established tumors.

blood was measured . Shown are b, the representative scatter plots, and c, the frequency of 
Adpgk-specific CTLs on day 35. d, Clonal contraction of Ag-specific CD8α+ T-cell 
responses elicited by sHDL-Adpgk/CpG and sHDL-SIINFEKL/CpG vaccines was 
monitored for eight weeks after the last vaccination. e, C57BL/6 mice were inoculated 
subcutaneously with 105 MC-38 tumor cells and vaccinated with the indicated formulations 
(equivalent to 15.5 nmol mutated Adpgk peptide and 2.3 nmol CpG) on days 10, 17, and 24. 
Shown are the percent of intracellular IFN-γ+, TNF-α+, and IFN-γ+TNF-α+ CD8α+ T-cells 
in peripheral blood on day 30 after ex vivo restimulation with the mutated Adpgk Ag. 
Average and individual MC-38 tumor growth curves are shown with fraction of complete 
tumor regression (CR). f, C57BL/6 mice were inoculated subcutaneously with 105 MC-38 
tumor cells and vaccinated with the indicated formulations (equivalent to 15.5 nmol mutated 
Adpgk peptide and 2.3 nmol CpG) on days 10 and 17. On days 1 and 4 after each 
vaccination, mice were administered intraperitoneally with αPD-1 (100 μg/mouse). Average 
and individual MC-38 tumor growth curves are shown. The data show mean ± SD from a 
representative experiment (n = 5-10) from 2-3 independent experiments. * p < 0.05, ** p < 
0.01, *** p < 0.001, and **** p < 0.0001, analyzed by (c) one-way ANOVA or (e,f) two-
way ANOVA with Bonferroni multiple comparisons post-test. Asterisks in (e,f) indicate 
statistically significant differences between sHDL-Ag/CpG and all other treatment groups.

 Figure 5. Tumor eradication by combination immunotherapy with multi-epitope vaccine 
nanodiscs and immune checkpoint blockade
a-d, C57BL/6 mice were inoculated subcutaneously with 105 melanoma B16F10 cells and 
vaccinated on days 4, 11, and 18 with indicated formulations (10 nmol of each antigen 
peptide and 2.3 nmol of CpG). For the combination immunotherapy, on days 1 and 4 after 
each vaccination, αPD-1 and αCTLA-4 (100 μg/mouse each) were administered 
intraperitoneally. Shown are a, the percent of IFN-γ+ CD8α+ or CD4+ T cells in peripheral 
blood measured by intracellular cytokine staining, and b-d, average and individual B16F10 
tumor growth curves. The data show mean ± SD from a representative experiment (n = 5-10) 
from 2-3 independent experiments. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, and **** p < 
0.0001, analyzed by (a) one-way ANOVA or (b-d) two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni 
multiple comparisons post-test. Asterisks in (b-d) indicate statistically significant 
differences between sHDL-Ag/CpG and all other treatment groups.
