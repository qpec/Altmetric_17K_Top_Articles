Abstract
Recent behavioral investigations suggest that acute stress can increase prosocial behavior. Here, we investigated whether
increased empathy represents a potential mechanism for this finding. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we
assessed the effects of acute stress on neural responses related to automatic and regulatory components of empathy for
pain as well as subsequent prosocial behavior. Stress increased activation in brain areas associated with the automatic
sharing of others’ pain, such as the anterior insula, the anterior midcingulate cortex, and the primary somatosensory
cortex. In addition, we found increased prosocial behavior under stress. Furthermore, activation in the anterior
midcingulate cortex mediated the effects of stress on prosocial behavior. However, stressed participants also displayed
stronger and inappropriate other-related responses in situations which required them to take the perspective of another
person, and to regulate their automatic affective responses. Thus, while acute stress may increase prosocial behavior by in-
tensifying the sharing of others’ emotions, this comes at the cost of reduced cognitive appraisal abilities. Depending on the
contextual constraints, stress may therefore affect empathy in ways that are either beneficial or detrimental.

Introduction
Stress is omnipresent in modern human life and known to have
a profound impact on behavior and cognition (Starcke and
Brand, 2012; Hermans et al., 2014). While its effects on social
interactions are only poorly understood, accumulating evidence
suggests that prosocial behavior is increased under acute stress
(Takahashi et al., 2007; von Dawans et al., 2012; Vinkers et al.,
2013; Buchanan and Preston, 2014; Margittai et al., 2015).
Findings such as these are in line with the concept of a ‘tend-
and-befriend’ stress response, which proposes that affiliative
behavior increases under stress in order to secure support from
others (Taylor et al., 2000). Although originally this hypothesis
was proposed as a typical female stress response (Taylor et al.,
2000), more recent empirical work suggested that also males
may engage in such a response pattern (for a review, see:
Buchanan and Preston, 2014). However, the psychological and

 neural mechanisms which may cause such increases in affilia-
tive behavior are largely unexplored.
Empathy—the ability to share the emotions of others—is
one potentially promising mechanism. It enables us to emotion-
ally connect to and understand others’ emotions. Since em-
pathy has strong links to prosocial behavior (such as altruism or
cooperation; e.g. Batson, 2010) and activity in neural systems
associated with self-other resonance has been shown to correl-
ate with prosocial behavior (Christov-Moore and Iacoboni,
2016), it is crucial to establish how empathy is affected by stress,
and
how
this
in
turn
may
influence
prosocial
behavior.
According to recent neuro-cognitive models empathy entails an
automatic,
sensory-driven
(bottom-up)
component,
relying
upon emotion contagion and vicarious sharing of the other per-
son’s affect, and a (top-down) modulation of this automatic re-
sponse by more deliberately deployed components such as
cognitive appraisal, self-other distinction and perspective tak-
ing (e.g. for reviews Decety and Lamm, 2006; Shamay-Tsoory,
2011; Zaki and Ochsner, 2012; Singer and Klimecki, 2014).
Interestingly, stress has been suggested to increase automatic
response tendencies and to decrease control processes (for re-
views, see Starcke and Brand, 2012; Hermans et al., 2014; Phelps
et al., 2014). We therefore predicted that automatic sensory-
driven processes related to empathy will be promoted under
stress, while more effortful processes, such as deliberate cogni-
tive appraisals and self-other distinction, will be compromised
(Epley et al., 2004). However, another possible prediction would
be that both, cognitive–deliberate and automatic–reflexive com-
ponents of empathy are decreased under stress. Indeed, re-
search
on
patients
suffering
from
post-traumatic
stress
disorder has shown diminished cognitive and emotional em-
pathy in these patients (Palgi et al., 2016). In addition, it has
been shown that acute stress can increase self-focused atten-
tion (Rimmele and Lobmaier, 2012)—which in turn might impair
emotion contagion as people might simply pay less attention to
the emotions of others.
In order to test these opposing hypotheses, we used func-
tional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to assess how acute
stress affects the neural concomitants of these distinct compo-
nents of empathy, and how this is related to prosocial behavior.
More specifically, we measured brain activity in healthy
male volunteers using an experimental paradigm tailored to dif-
ferentiate automatic and regulatory processes related to em-
pathy for pain (Lamm et al., 2007). Prior research using this and
related paradigms has consistently shown that seeing others in
pain activates brain regions similar to the ones recruited when
experiencing pain oneself (Lamm et al., 2011) leading to an
emerging consensus that empathy is underpinned by shared
neural representations (Ru
¨ tgen et al., 2015). This ‘empathy for
pain network’ mainly comprises the anterior insula (AI) and the
anterior midcingulate cortex (aMCC), and—for picture-based
paradigms, such as the one used here—also the somatosensory
cortex (see also Keysers et al., 2010; Lamm et al., 2011).
The present study assessed the effects of stress on such
shared neural representations, and their modulation by cogni-
tive appraisal. Since stress has been shown to increase automa-
ticity (Starcke and Brand, 2012; Hermans et al., 2014), our first
main hypothesis was that experimentally induced psychosocial
stress would increase affect sharing, and that this would be indi-
cated by increased neural responses in areas related to shared
representations. As empathy has been proposed as a facilitator
of prosocial behavior (Batson, 2010), our second main hypoth-
esis was that these increases in affect sharing will be related to
increases in prosocial behavior. Finally, since we were also
interested in the effects of stress on regulatory components
related to empathy, the experimental paradigm included a con-
dition in which participants had to use cognitive appraisal to re-
duce
their
aversive
responses
to
only
seemingly
painful
situations. Prior research using such a manipulation had shown
that the associated modulation of empathy is accompanied by
activation in prefrontal cortical areas, including orbitofrontal
cortex (OFC) and medial and lateral prefrontal areas and the
right temporo-parietal junction (Lamm et al., 2007). Based on
detrimental effects of stress on control processes and executive
functions (Starcke and Brand, 2012; Hermans et al., 2014), our
third main hypothesis predicted that cognitive appraisal and
self-other distinction will be decreased by stress, and hence
also the neural responses in areas related to these functions.
Materials and methods
Participants
Seventy-six male participants between 18 and 40 years were
included in the study. All participants filled out screening ques-
tionnaires before the experiment to assess trait socio-cognitive
abilities and social anxiety (see supplementary material for a
description of the screening). The study was approved by the
ethics committee of the Medical University of Vienna and was
performed in line with the latest revision of the Declaration of
Helsinki (1964). All participants received between e30 and 40 for
participation, depending on how much they shared during one
of the experimental tasks. After outlier exclusion (described in
the supplementary material), our final sample consisted of 67
participants (35 stress group, 32 control group) for the fMRI ana-
lyses and 66 participants (34 stress group, 32 control group) for
behavioral data analyses of the empathy for pain paradigm.
Experimental procedures
Participants first underwent a preparation phase outside the
scanner and received instructions for the experimental tasks.
Scanning commenced with an anatomical scan and a brief
paradigm which helped participants to adapt to the fMRI envir-
onment. After the preparation paradigm, the stress paradigm
[either stress or control version of the Montreal Imaging Stress
Task (MIST); Dedovic et al., 2005] was implemented and immedi-
ately afterwards we implemented the empathy for pain para-
digm.

procedures including saliva sampling is provided in the supple-
mentary material.
Stress paradigm
Stress was induced by an adapted version of the Montreal
Imaging Stress Task (MIST; Dedovic et al., 2005) which includes a
mental arithmetic challenge under time pressure, together with
social evaluative threat. The evaluative threat is induced by a
failure to achieve the minimum performance in the arithmetic
challenges paired with consistent negative feedback given by
the experimenter. In the present study, we used the MIST as a
stress induction method only and did not investigate neural ac-
tivation during the paradigm. Therefore, we only used the ex-
perimental (i.e. stress-inducing) condition for the stress group
and the control condition for the control group. Furthermore,
the extent of social evaluative threat was further increased by
showing participants live webcam recordings of an experi-
menter allegedly watching them and taking notes while they
were solving the mental arithmetic challenges in the scanner.

 In the control condition, participants were solving mental arith-
metic challenges with the same level of difficulty as during the
experimental condition, but without time restriction, evaluation
of their performance or being watched by the experimenter.
Thus, the control condition was designed to match the mental
arithmetic aspects of the task, but without the stress compo-
nents (Dedovic et al., 2005). A detailed description of the stress
measures (i.e. saliva sampling and analyses) is provided in the
supplementary material.
Empathy for pain paradigm
We used a paradigm successfully applied before to tap into dif-
ferent components of empathy for pain, including affect shar-
ing, cognitive appraisal and perspective taking (Lamm et al.,
2007; Lamm and Decety, 2008). It required participants to watch
images of needle injections into a human hand (see supplemen-
tary material for a detailed description of the stimuli). In one con-
dition (the injection condition), participants were informed that
the needle injections were painful for the patients. In another
condition (the biopsy condition), participants were informed that
the target’s hand had been anesthetized and that the patients
therefore
could
not
feel
any
pain
during
this
procedure.
Importantly, this condition required participants to modulate
their automatic aversive response to the only seemingly aver-
sive, but in reality innocuous situation. A third, non-painful, con-
trol condition (the Q-tip condition) showed the same hands,
without anesthesia, being touched by a Q-tip. Behavioral re-
sponses were collected via a rating scale presented after each
condition block. Participants had to separately rate the level of
unpleasantness supposedly experienced by the patient (Rating
UNPLEASANT
OTHER), and their own unpleasant affect (Rating
UNPLEASANT SELF) while watching the images, using a 7-point rating
scale ranging from 1 (low unpleasantness) to 7 (high unpleasant-
ness). This enabled disentangling other-related from self-related
affective responses to others’ pain.
d2 attention test
In order to assess whether the stress manipulation might also
have induced changes in cognitive load and attention, we
included
an
adapted
version
of
the
d2
attention
test
(Brickenkamp and Zillmer, 1998) two times during the experi-
mental session—i.e. 15 min after the onset of the stressor (or
control paradigm) (t1) and 45 min after the onset of the stressor/
stressor control (t2).
Prosocial behavior
We used a ‘dictator game’ (Forsythe et al., 1994) setup as a proxy
to measure prosocial behavior. Participants were endowed with
e10.- and instructed that they could divide the money between
themselves and the next participant of the experiment (who re-
mained anonymous and was neither met before nor after the
experiment), according to a ratio that was entirely theirs to de-
cide, on a scale ranging from e0.- to 10.- in e0.50 steps. They
were also informed that they would be paid out the money they
decided to keep for themselves, plus the money the previous
participant had left them (without informing them how much
that was until the end of the experiment). Participants then dis-
closed their decision.
Statistical analyses of behavioral data
In order to confirm that stress and control group did not differ
in variables such as age, socio-cognitive abilities and social anx-
iety, we computed two-sample t tests for each measure. The
effectiveness of the stress induction was tested with repeated-
measures ANOVAs with the within-subjects factor time (5 re-
peated measures for cortisol and 8 for subjective stress and
mood ratings) and the between-subjects factor group (stress,
control). Furthermore, we assessed group differences in cortisol
response (i.e. prestress to peak D) as well as subjective stress re-
sponse (again, pre-stress to peak D) using two-sample t-tests. In
case
Levene’s
test
indicated
unequal
variances,
we
used
Welch’s t test with corrected degrees of freedom. Behavioral
data of the empathy for pain paradigm was analyzed in a
repeated-measures ANOVA with the within-subjects factors
condition (injection, biopsy and Q-tip) and rating (unpleasantness
for self, other) and the between-subjects factor group (stress,
control). Greenhouse–Geisser corrections were used when the
assumption of homogeneity of covariances was violated (as
determined
by
Mauchly
tests
of
sphericity).
Bonferroni-
corrected post-hoc pairwise comparisons were computed to
examine interactions and omnibus main effects. Performance
in the two runs of the d2 attention test was assessed by com-
puting
the
concentration
performance
(CP)
measure
as
described in Brickenkamp and Zillmer (1998). This measure was
included in a repeated-measures ANOVA with the within-
subjects factor time (run1, run2) and the between-subjects factor
group (stress, control). We assessed group differences in the pro-
social task using the non-parametric Mann–Whitney U test,
since due to an over-representation of decisions to share
exactly half of the money the data was not following a normal
distribution. Furthermore, we tested one-sided due to consist-
ent previous findings of increased prosocial behavior under
stress using the dictator game paradigm (Takahashi et al., 2007;
von Dawans et al., 2012; Vinkers et al., 2013; Buchanan and
Preston, 2014; Margittai et al., 2015) and the fact that our study
had been explicitly designed to test possible mechanisms ex-
plaining these findings. All data were analyzed using SPSS (v20)
and the significance threshold was set to a ¼ 0.05. Effect sizes
are reported as gp
2.
Statistical analyses of fMRI data
Details on MRI acquisition and preprocessing are reported in
the supplemental material. MRI data were preprocessed and
analyzed using SPM12 (Statistical Parametric Mapping, http://
www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm). The fMRI time series were analyzed
using a block design approach in the context of the General
Linear Model (GLM). Effects were modeled in a block-wise fash-
ion by combining the four trials (i.e. the four pictures) in each
block into one epoch. The fixation cross block served as an im-
plicit baseline. Single-subject (first-level) models consisted of
multiple regressors separately modeling the three conditions
(injection, biopsy, Q-tip) based on the time periods in which the
20 blocks for each condition were presented and—as regressors
of no interest—the periods during which the instruction screen
rating scales were shown. Each effect was modeled as a boxcar
function, and then convolved with the canonical hemodynamic
response function as implemented in SPM12. Residual head
movement effects were accounted for by including the six rigid-
body motion parameters (translation and rotation) as nuisance
regressors.
Our target contrasts compared the injection condition with
the Q-tip condition (INJECTION > QTIP), with the latter serving

 as a non-painful control condition, and the biopsy with the Q-
tip condition (BIOPSY > QTIP). These first-level contrasts were
entered into a second-level random-effects analysis using a
flexible factorial model with the factors subject, group (stress,
control),
and
condition
contrasts
(INJECTION > QTIP,
BIOPSY > QTIP). Within this model, we then compared groups
(stress and control) in both condition contrasts, in order to enable
inferences on the population level (Penny and Holmes, 2004). As
the main goal of our study was to assess how stress modulates
different processes related to automatic vs regulative compo-
nents of empathy for pain, we have tailored our design such that
the two can be compared to a third, unequivocally non-painful
control condition (i.e. hands touched by a Q-tip). Notably, this Q-
tip condition also enabled the ‘classical’ Pain vs No Pain contrast
commonly used in empathy for pain studies (for a meta-
analysis, see Lamm et al., 2011), allowing us to more directly com-
pare our evidence to previous findings. As we were specifically
interested in stress effects on neural responding in the empathy
for pain network, we first tested for group differences in regions
of interest in the empathy for pain network using coordinates
from a meta-analysis of fMRI studies on empathy for pain
(Lamm et al., 2011, see supplementary material for a listing of the
coordinates). For this ROI analysis, we extracted mean activation
from three core empathy for pain network regions (i.e. left and
right anterior insula (AI) and anterior midcingulate cortex
(aMCC)) using the REX toolbox (http://web.mit.edu/swg/software.
htm) for region of interest extraction (REX), using 5 mm spheres
centered on coordinates reported in (Lamm et al., 2011). In add-
ition to these ROI analyses, we performed whole-brain analyses
using family wise error (FWE, voxel-level) correction over the
whole brain. The SPM Anatomy Toolbox (Eickhoff et al., 2005) was
used to guide anatomical and probabilistic cytoarchitectonic lo-
calization of the resulting activation. Additionally, we carried out
a psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analysis (described in the
supplementary material) to investigate connectivity changes for
the results of the main analyses in more detail.
Correlation brain and behavior
Our main methodological approach was to correlate brain acti-
vation from the extracted ROIs of the empathy for pain network
with behavioral data. We correlated behavioral data from the
unpleasantness ratings during the empathy for pain paradigm,
the emotion contagion questionnaire (Doherty, 1997) and the
dictator game with brain activation in the ROIs from the em-
pathy for pain network. See supplementary material for a de-
tailed description of these analyses. In addition, we calculated a
mediation analysis to investigate the results of the conducted
correlations in more detail (described in the results section,
Associations between behavioral and fMRI data).
Results
Stress and control group did not differ in age, social anxiety and
trait socio-cognitive abilities such as empathic concern, perspec-
tive taking (calculated with sub-scores as recommended by Koller
and Lamm (2014)) and emotion contagion (all P-values� 0.106).
Descriptive statistics of the questionnaire results are provided in
the supplementary material.
Stress manipulation
As expected, individuals of the stress group showed higher cor-
tisol responses as well as higher subjective stress ratings com-
pared to individuals in the control group. All results of the
stress manipulation are described in detail in the supplemen-
tary material.
Self-report affect ratings during empathy for pain
paradigm
A 2 � 3 repeated measures ANOVA revealed a significant main
effect of condition [F(2,128) ¼ 348.399, P < 0.001, gp
2¼0.85] and
rating [F(1,64) ¼ 6.649, P ¼ 0.012, gp
2¼0.09], a significant condi-
tion � rating interaction [F(2,128) ¼ 18.604, P < 0.001, gp
2¼0.23],
and a significant interaction of group � condition � rating
[F(2,128) ¼ 3.584, P ¼ 0.031, gp
2¼0.05]. All other main effects and
interactions
were
non-significant
(all
P-values � 0.100).
Bonferroni-corrected pairwise comparisons showed that the
significant three-way interaction was driven by group differ-
ences in the ratings between other (Rating UNPLEASANT OTHER) and
self (Rating UNPLEASANT SELF) during the biopsy condition. While
in the stress group there was no significant difference between
Rating UNPLEASANT OTHER and Rating UNPLEASANTNESS SELF in this
condition (P ¼ 0.440), the control group reported higher self-
related
unpleasantness
than
other-related
unpleasantness
when seeing biopsy pictures (Rating UNPLEASANTNESS SELF>Rating
UNPLEASANTNESS
OTHER;
P ¼ 0.011;
mean
difference ¼ 0.750,
SE ¼ 0.285). Supplementary Figure S2 in the supplementary ma-
terial illustrates this group difference between the unpleasant-
ness ratings for the biopsy condition.
d2 attention test
Testing for changes in performance in the d2 attention task re-
vealed
a
significant
increase
of
performance
over
time
[F(1,65) ¼ 10.093, P ¼ 0.002, gp
2¼ 0.13], but no group-related dif-
ferences (all P-values � 0.870).
Dictator game
Prosocial
behavior
showed
a
significant
group
difference
[Mann–Whitney U(67) ¼ 423; Z ¼ �1.830, P ¼ 0.034, r ¼ 0.22), with
higher amounts of money transferred by the stress than by the
control group (mean ranks 37.91 vs 29.72; e4.67 vs e3.67 trans-
ferred on average).
fMRI analysis
ROI analyses for the STRESS > CONTROL: INJECTION > QTIP con-
trast showed significantly higher activation in the stress group
in
left
AI
[t(65) ¼ 2.427,
P ¼ 0.018]
and
aMCC
[t(65) ¼ 2.745,
P ¼ 0.008]. The whole-brain analysis complemented this finding
by also showing higher activation in left AI and aMCC. In add-
ition, the whole-brain analysis showed higher activation in the
stress group in bilateral somatosensory cortex, as well as in in-
ferior frontal gyrus and the right extrastriate body area (EBA,
Downing et al., 2001; see Figure 1a). The reverse comparison
(CONTROL > STRESS: INJECTION > QTIP) did not reveal any sig-
nificant differences neither in the ROI, nor in the whole-brain
analyses. Assessing effects related to regulatory control with
the contrast STRESS > CONTROL: BIOPSY > QTIP also revealed
significantly higher activation in the stress group in left AI
[t(65) ¼ 2.672, P ¼ 0.010] in the ROI analysis. The whole brain ana-
lysis showed stronger activation in the stress group in aMCC,
caudate nucleus (CN), inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and dorsolat-
eral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC; Figure 1b). The reverse contrast
(CONTROL > STRESS: BIOPSY > QTIP) did not reveal any signifi-
cant differences, neither in the ROI nor in the whole-brain ana-
lyses. Since the stress group showed stronger activation for

 both target contrasts (i.e. INJECTION > QTIP and BIOPSY > QTIP)
in partially overlapping areas of the empathy for pain network,
we were interested in assessing the extent of activation overlap
in these areas. To this end, we performed a conjunction analysis
on the two contrasts STRESS > CONTROL: INJECTION > QTIP \
STRESS > CONTROL: BIOPSY > QTIP. This analysis revealed that
the stress group showed higher activation in both conditions in
aMCC, occipital cortex and caudate nucleus. Table 1 depicts the
MNI coordinates of the peak voxels resulting from this analysis.
In addition, we also calculated this conjunction analysis using a
more liberal threshold for correcting for multiple comparisons
[i.e. cluster level family wise error correction at P < 0.05 (selec-
tion threshold P ¼ 0.001)]. We report the results, which show a
similar general pattern, in the supplementary material. Finally,
for the sake of completeness, we also calculated group differ-
ences for the contrast between the two target conditions [i.e.
INJECTION > BIOPSY
(and
reverse)],
showing
no
activation
differences.
Additionally, to test whether the group differences specific-
ally resulted from activation differences in our target conditions
(i.e. injection, biopsy), as opposed to being the result of unspe-
cific differences in the Q-tip control condition, we assessed po-
tential group differences in the Q-tip control stimuli [contrasts
STRESS > CONTROL (and reverse): QTIP > FIXATION]. This did
not reveal any activation differences in areas revealed by the re-
sults reported above (see supplementary material for a detailed
description of the results from this analysis).
Associations between behavioral and fMRI data
In the stress group, trait emotion contagion in the sub-domain
sadness significantly correlated with activation in the left AI
ROI during the injection condition: r ¼ 0.581, P < 0.001, using a
Bonferroni-corrected threshold level corrected for the three cor-
relations (i.e. with the three coordinate-based ROIs) computed:
Pcorrected ¼ 0.05/3 ¼ 0.017). For the biopsy condition, stress group
trait emotion contagion in the domain sadness correlated with
activation in left AI (r ¼ 0.494, P ¼ 0.003) and aMCC (r ¼ 0.457,
P ¼ 0.006). For the control group, trait emotion contagion did not
correlate with activation in any of the ROIs, neither for the
injection, nor for the biopsy condition (all P-values � 0.440).
Calculating exploratory correlations between the IRI subscales
and neural responding in the empathy for pain ROIs, did not re-
veal any significant results (all P-values � 0.168). Furthermore,
across all participants, activation in aMCC (r ¼ 0.417, P < 0.001)
during the injection as well as biopsy condition (i.e. derived
from
conjunction
contrast:
INJECTION > QTIP:
STRESS > CONTROL
and
BIOPSY > QTIP:
STRESS > CONTROL)
correlated positively with the amount of money participants
shared in the prosocial task. In addition, activation in the aMCC
during the biopsy condition correlated negatively with the dif-
ference in ratings of unpleasantness for self and other during
the biopsy condition (r1=
40.300, P1=
40.017). Thus, higher activation
in aMCC was associated with lower self-other distinction in
unpleasantness ratings in the biopsy condition. We, in addition,
were interested to assess whether the relationship between
aMCC activation and prosocial behavior was driven by direct in-
fluences
of
stress
on
prosocial
behavior,
mediated
by
empathy-related aMCC activation. We therefore calculated a
mediation analysis with group (stress and control) as the
categorical
predictor,
aMCC
activation
the
mediator,
and
prosocial
behavior
the
outcome
variable.
Analyses
were

We

data.
Statistical significance with alpha at 0.05 is indicated by
the 95% confidence intervals not crossing zero. We found a
significant mediation effect of aMCC activity with respect
to the relation between group and prosocial behavior (in-
direct effect ¼ 0.68, SE ¼ 0.26, 95% CI ¼ [0.26, 1.33]). In add-
ition, this mediation was total, meaning that aMCC activity
accounted completely for prosocial behavior, as the direct
effect of group did not significantly predict prosocial be-
havior (P ¼ 0.646).

 components engaged during empathy for pain. We assessed dif-
ferences in brain activation, self-report and their relation to pro-
social behavior between stressed and non-stressed participants.
Our assessment of how stress modulated these responses
revealed three central findings. First, we found that when view-
ing others in pain, stressed participants showed stronger activa-
tion in the empathy for pain network than control participants
who were not stressed. Interestingly, stressed participants also
showed stronger activation in EBA, i.e. a lateral occipital area
specifically
associated
with
the
processing
of
body
parts
(Downing et al., 2001). This suggests that stress may already in-
fluence early visual processing of others’ pain. Second, we repli-
cated results of former studies showing increased prosocial
behavior under stress (Takahashi et al., 2007; von Dawans et al.,
2012; Vinkers et al., 2013; Buchanan and Preston, 2014; Margittai
et al., 2015); but see also Steinbeis et al., 2015) and furthermore
show that activation in a core area of the empathy for pain net-
work, i.e. aMCC, in response to the pain of others positively cor-
related
with
prosocial
behavior.
An
additional
mediation
analysis further showed that aMCC activity was a full mediator
of the effects of stress on prosocial behavior. This provides a
potential mechanism of how stress increases prosocial behav-
ior—i.e., by increasing affect sharing with others, rather than af-
fecting prosocial behavior directly. Third, when informed that
the stimuli depicted biopsies performed on an anesthetized
hand, and hence appeared aversive to participants but in reality
were not painful for the patient, stressed participants still
showed stronger activation in the empathy for pain network. In
line with this, a conjunction analysis revealed that stressed par-
ticipants showed stronger overlapping activation in a core re-
gion of the empathy for pain network, the aMCC, during both
the injection and the biopsy conditions. Additionally, activation
in left AI and aMCC in response to both, injection and biopsy
condition, correlated with trait emotion contagion in stressed
participants.
Taken together, this pattern of findings suggests that while
stress increases automatic empathic responses, regulatory
mechanisms to modulate this automatic affect sharing re-
sponse seem to be impaired. Our finding of stronger engage-
ment of DLPFC and IFG in the stress group during the biopsy
condition might represent some engagement in (not perfectly
successful) regulation, since both DLPFC and IFG have been re-
peatedly associated with emotion regulation and cognitive con-
trol (Wager et al., 2008; Ochsner et al., 2013). Although this
interpretation would be also in line with a recent study showing
decreased efficacy of regions associated with self-control under
stress (Maier et al., 2015), it should be noted that both, IFG and
DLPFC, have been associated with various other cognitive and
emotional processes besides emotion regulation (Duncan and
Owen, 2000; Shamay-Tsoory et al., 2009). Furthermore, add-
itional connectivity analyses using DLPFC and IFG as seed re-
gions
in
order
to
clarify
their
engagement
in
regulatory
mechanisms did not reveal any differences between stress and
control group in the connectivity of these regions. Thus, our in-
terpretation of this observed activation remains speculative and
further research should address the specific mechanisms at
play in more detail.
A number of control conditions speak for the specificity of
our findings. First, group differences in empathy-related areas
cannot be attributed to generalized stress effects on the neural
processing of visual or social stimuli, as shown by the absence
of group differences for the Q-tip control stimuli. Second, we as-
sessed cognitive load and attention at two time points during
the experiment and did not find any group differences. Thus,
we can rule out that our findings result from a general effect of
stress on participants’ cognitive load or attentional processing.
Third, potential group differences in socio-cognitive abilities are
also unlikely to explain our findings, as the two groups did not
differ in several trait socio-cognitive abilities. Interestingly, as
indicated by the behavioral data, participants were able to

 appropriately rate the target’s unpleasantness in the different
conditions.
The group � condition � rating interaction for the biopsy in-
dicates that control participants differentiated more between
self- and other-related feelings in that condition, compared to
stressed participants. In addition, the magnitude in responding
in aMCC during the biopsy condition correlated negatively with
differentiation between self and other in the unpleasantness
ratings in the biopsy condition—i.e. stronger responding went
along with lower self-other differentiation. This might be ex-
plained as a lower distinction between self- and other-related
emotions in the stress group, and is in line with our prior find-
ing that male participants show decreased self-other distinction
under stress (Tomova et al., 2014).
Interestingly, we did not find group differences in neural re-
sponding between the two conditions (i.e. the group compari-
sons for the contrasts: INJECTION > BIOPSY and the opposite
BIOPSY > INJECTION). However, it should be noted that due to
the multi-dimensional and complex nature of empathy, the two
conditions, as designed in this study, are certainly not solely
measuring isolated aspects of empathy making direct subtrac-
tions of activation strength difficult to interpret. However, fu-
ture research should address this issue with study designs
more suitable to address this aspect more explicitly. In conclu-
sion, our study indicates that stress might have a positive im-
pact on empathy by increasing automatic resonance with the
emotions of others, which is associated with increases in proso-
cial behavior. This, however, comes at the cost of decreased
regulation, as exerted by processes such as cognitive appraisal
and perspective taking, which may result in inaccurate and mis-
guided empathic responses. Our results therefore indicate that
stress does not act on one isolated component of empathy, but
affects bottom-up and top-down components in opposing ways.
This is in accordance with a recent theoretical account stating
that stress causes a shift in brain processing from an execu-
tively controlled mode to a salience-driven mode (Hermans
et al., 2014). Our results support this account and further extend
it into the domain of social cognition. Thus, whether stress is
adaptive and beneficial in shaping social interaction and behav-
ior strongly depends on the complexity and requirements of the
specific social situation. For example, in simple emergency situ-
ations (such as helping a person who has been hit by a car)
where fast and automatic reactions are necessary, increased
resonance with the emotions of others may lead to more imme-
diate helping behavior. In contrast, in more complex situations
(for example someone showing tears of happiness) decreased
perspective taking abilities may lead to situations where the
context and the emotions of others are misinterpreted, possibly
resulting in inappropriate social behavior. These distinct cogni-
tive processing modes and their differential reactivity to stress
should be taken into account in future research assessing the
effects of stress on social behavior.
