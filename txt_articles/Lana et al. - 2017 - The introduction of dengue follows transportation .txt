Abstract
Human mobility, presence and passive transportation of Aedes aegypti mosquito, and envi-
ronmental characteristics are a group of factors which contribute to the success of dengue
spread and establishment. To understand this process, we assess data from dengue
national and municipal basins regarding population and demographics, transportation net-
work, human mobility, and Ae. aegypti monitoring for the Brazilian state of Acre since the
first recorded dengue case in the year 2000 to the year 2015. During this period, several
changes in Acre’s transport infrastructure and urbanization have been started. To recon-
struct the process of dengue introduction in Acre, we propose an analytic framework based
on concepts used in malaria literature, namely vulnerability and receptivity, to inform risk
assessments in dengue-free regions as well as network theory concepts for disease inva-
sion and propagation. We calculate the probability of dengue importation to Acre from other
Brazilian states, the evolution of dengue spread between Acrean municipalities and dengue
establishment in the state. Our findings suggest that the landscape changes associated with
human mobility have created favorable conditions for the establishment of dengue virus
transmission in Acre. The revitalization of its major roads, as well as the increased accessi-
bility by air to and within the state, have increased dengue vulnerability. Unplanned urbani-
zation and population growth, as observed in Acre during the period of study, contribute to
ideal conditions for Ae. aegypti mosquito establishment, increase the difficulty in mosquito
control and consequently its local receptivity.

 Author summary
The present ecological study is aimed at characterizing introduction and spread of dengue
in the state of Acre, located in Brazil’s north region. We use sociodemographic and ento-
mological data from the year 2000, when the first case was registered in Acre, up to 2015,
when it was already endemic in most of the state. We use a methodological framework
based on well-established concepts in malaria literature, namely vulnerability and recep-
tivity, to assess dengue introduction and propagation in the study area. We make use of
effective reproduction number as an empirical indicator of dengue outbreak spatiotempo-
ral patterns, as well as complex network theory concepts applied to human mobility and
transport infrastructure changes to address dengue importation probability from other
Brazilian states and its circulation within Acrean municipalities. On the one hand, we
show that the increase of airline passengers, coupled with observed dengue incidence in
Brazil, has steadily increased Acre’s vulnerability to dengue introduction, while transport
infrastructure development has facilitated its spread within the state. On the other hand,
socio-demographic changes aimed at urbanization and economic development have
increased receptivity to its main vector, the Aedes aegypti mosquito. The combination of
those two factors ultimately leads to the establishment of the virus in Acre.
Introduction
The worldwide spread of dengue fever has been attributed to human mobility [1] as well as the
passive transportation of its vector Aedes aegypti, a mosquito with autonomous flying capacity
[2, 3]. According to the literature, the global spread of dengue from Africa to Asia and the
Americas was historically caused by the periodic human voyages across the oceans [4, 5]. God-
ding [6] further described outbreaks of dengue aboard ships. More recently, in a local survey
in Iquitos, Peru, Stoddard et al. [1] showed that the movement of humans to places where con-
tact with mosquitoes was probable was determinant for the transmission of dengue, regardless
of the distance between people’s place of residence. On a collective scale, spatial patterns of
dengue distribution are determined by the social networks, since an individual’s routine move-
ments are similar to those of their contacts [1].
More recently, increased air transportation also contributed to dengue spread, carrying
both infected humans and mosquitoes to distant places. There are reports of catching Ae.
aegypti within aircraft that landed in cities where there were no records of dengue cases [7].
Several studies of disease dispersion have used airline database and human mobility networks
coupled with epidemiological models to provide mathematical frameworks for the study of
spatiotemporal dispersion [8, 9], risk assessment of case importation during outbreaks [10]
and estimation of potential invasion routes [11, 12]. Such frameworks have been applied to a
variety of illnesses such as the 1968-69 Hong Kong [8] and the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandem-
ics [13], the 2013 MERS-CoV epidemic [14], the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa [15–17],
and the 2016 Zika outbreak in the Americas [18], for instance.
In Brazil, reports of diseases compatible with dengue date back to the 19th century [19, 20],
but its circulation was interrupted in conjunction with the urban yellow fever after the intense
Ae. aegypti eradication campaigns in the early 20th century. After the re-invasion of the mos-
quito in the 1970s, the reintroduction of dengue viruses was laboratory confirmed in 1982 in
the state of Roraima. In 1986, after four years without records of dengue cases, a DENV-1 epi-
demic settled in Rio de Janeiro with fatal cases confirmed in the laboratory [21, 22]. Since

 then, dengue became endemic in Brazil, with the circulation of all four serotypes, and mostly
concentrated in the southeast region.
Among the Brazilian states, the northwesternmost state of Acre, in the Amazon region, was
the last to register dengue cases. The Amazon region is one of the last frontiers of development
in Brazil. At its western extreme, Acre occupies a strategic, but underdeveloped, place of inte-
gration in South America due to its geographical position in relation to the Pacific Ocean and
its triple border with Peru and Bolivia. In the last 15 years, Acre has been the target of diverse
and intensive government programs aimed at boosting its development. Examples of such pro-
grams are agrarian reform with the creation of several settlements; paving of roadways and
expansion of airports [23, 24]; the stimulus to new economic activities; and strengthening the
exchange of commodities between Brazil and the Pacific countries by means of the Pacific
road, completed in 2010. In response to these investments, the population of some municipali-
ties doubled from the year 2000 to 2010, and the percentage of urbanization increased in 20 of
its 22 municipalities [25]. It was during this period that the introduction and spread of the den-
gue virus in the state was observed, almost 20 years after its introduction and establishment in
the country [21].
We hypothesize that the rate and pattern of dengue introduction and establishment in the
22 municipalities of Acre were directly affected by the fast changes in infrastructure and
urbanization. In this paper, we reconstruct the history of dengue introduction and establish-
ment in Acre, linking the epidemiological events to the evolution of human mobility within
the state, and between the state and the rest of the country. In this process, we propose an
analytical framework to inform (to be used in) risk assessments in other dengue-free regions
under similar development pressure.
The goal of this study was to assess how the risk of dengue establishment varied from 2000
to 2015 in the 22 cities of Acre, as the region changed in response to significant investments in
infrastructure and migration. For this purpose, we: 1) assessed how vulnerability (defined in
the next section) to dengue importation from outside the state changed during the study
period and identified the most likely sources of dengue to Acre; 2) assessed the relationship
between vulnerability to dengue within Acre, measured by rate of establishment, and munici-
palities’ centrality in terms of human mobility; 3) assessed available evidence on Acre’s recep-
tivity to dengue (defined in the next section) and how it changed during the study period.
Conceptual framework
The successful invasion of a parasite into a new place is the result of the interaction between
two players: the invading species and the invaded community. In the context of dengue, the
invaded community is composed of two main species: human hosts and mosquitoes of the spe-
cies Ae. aegypti whose interaction is further affected by environmental factors (climate, urbani-
zation, human behavior). The invading species under consideration, dengue viruses, cannot
establish itself in new areas unless the receiving community presents certain conditions to sus-
tain autochthonous virus transmission. More formally, the emergence of dengue fever in a
new region depends on the occurrence of two major events: (i) the arrival of at least one
infected individual in the city and (ii) the subsequent positive growth of autochthonous den-
gue cases (i.e., disease establishment) [26].
The sustained growth of autochthonous cases depends on “the abundant presence of vectors
and the existence of other ecological and climatic factors favoring transmission”, which is the
concept of receptivity found in the malaria literature [27]. If an area is receptive, then the
arrival of the virus by imported cases or vectors has a probability of triggering sustained local
transmission. Transmission is then measured by the effective reproductive number, Rt, defined

 as the expected number of secondary human cases that would result from the arrival of a single
infected individual in a susceptible population. A reproductive number greater than one sug-
gests epidemic growth.
The larger the influx of imported cases the higher the probability of establishment given the
necessary environmental conditions. In the malaria literature, this exposure to imported cases
is referred to as “Vulnerability” defined as “either proximity to endemic areas or. . .the frequent
influx of infected individuals or groups and/or infective anopheles” [28]. The same concept can
be applied to dengue epidemiology. Dengue influx might be measured directly from the num-
ber of cases that can be traced to outside areas (imported cases). In situations where the origin
of the cases is difficult to ascertain, one can estimate the number of imported cases from statis-
tics of transportation and prevalence in passengers’ origins [26].
Materials and methods
Study area
The state of Acre (AC) is located in the north region of Brazil, bordering the countries of Peru
and Bolivia, and the Amazonas and Rondo
ˆnia states in Brazil (see Fig 1 for geographical refer-
ence). The total area is 164,122 km2 with a population of 733,559 inhabitants and a population
density of 4.47 hab/km2 [25]. The state has 22 municipalities, the most populous being the cap-
ital Rio Branco and Cruzeiro do Sul, with 336,038 and 78,507 inhabitants according to 2010
Census [25], respectively. The Acrean climate is warm and humid equatorial, which is charac-
terized by high temperatures with small annual fluctuations, high pluviometric precipitation
indices and high relative humidity. The temperature is approximately uniform throughout the
state, with an annual average around 24,5˚C, and maximum around 32˚C [24].
Data
Dengue national data. Monthly counts of reported cases of dengue per Brazilian state,
from 2001 to 2012, were obtained from Departamento de Informática do Sistema Único de
Saúde (DataSUS, Department of Informatics of Universal Health System, http://datasus.saude.
gov.br/). The accumulated number of cases in each state during the period of study is shown
in Fig 1.
Dengue municipal data.
Weekly counts of reported cases of dengue per Acrean munici-
pality, from 2000 to 2015, were provided by the Brazilian Ministry of Health. Dengue reporting
is mandatory in Brazil, but most cases are defined using clinical-epidemiological criteria only.
Definition of dengue epidemiological year. Since dengue reaches higher activity levels
during the summer (Dec to March), it is more convenient to define the epidemiological year
as the period between July of a year and June of the next year, as opposed to the standard calen-
dar year.
Aedes aegypti data.
Available data regarding the presence of Ae. aegypti in the 22 munici-
palities of Acre was obtained from the Ministry of Health (MH) and internet bulletins.
Although MH has implemented the household larval survey (LI) and the Rapid Assessment of
Infestation by Ae. aegypti (LIRAa) since 1996, not all municipalities adhered to the protocol at
the same time. We searched the available information to identify the year in which the pres-
ence of the mosquito was confirmed for the first time in each municipality. It is important to
note, however, that this information can be incomplete for some cities, and the first detection
does not necessarily imply that the mosquito was not present before.
Population and demographic data.
The population size per Brazilian state from 2001 to
2012 was obtained from Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística (IBGE, Brazilian Institute
of Geography and Statistics) [25, 29]. The population count in rural and urban areas per

 municipality in Acre, in 2000 and 2010, as well as information on the proportion of households
with access to public services and other demographic variables were obtained from [25].
Transportation network.
To describe the Acrean transportation system, data regarding
the availability and status of roads, waterways, and airways was obtained from the Ministry
of Transport (http://www.transportes.gov.br), Agência Nacional de Aviação Civil (ANAC,
National Civil Aviation Agency, http://www.anac.gov.br) and Associação dos Municípios do
Acreanos (AMAC, Association of Acrean Municipalities, http://www.amac-acre.com.br).
Description of road status was obtained by request to the Departamento de Estradas e Rodagens
do Acre (DERACRE, Department of Roads and Roadways of Acre) and by consulting the
website of the Programa de Aceleração do Crescimento (PAC, Growth Acceleration Program,
http://www.pac.gov.br/). The connections between municipalities—i.e., the network edges—
were classified according to the presence and status of roads, waterways, and airways. In the
cases where municipalities were connected by more than one modal, this was taken into
account by including all corresponding edges. Road status was tentatively classified year by
year. However, since not all information was recorded every year, it is only an approximation.
The combination of modal type and road condition resulted in the following categories: (1)
unpaved road, (2) paved road and (3) road under maintenance; (4) waterway; and (5) airway.

 The third category encompassed roads under restoration, under construction and mixed
conditions.
Flight data.
To describe the flow of individuals to Acre, airline data from 2001 to 2012
was provided by ANAC. This dataset contains information on the origin-destination for pas-
sengers on direct flights (with or without stoppage). For those on connecting flights, ANAC
provides the number of travelers in transit per airport pair. We developed a methodology to
combine the data regarding direct flights and passengers in transit to estimate the total number
of passengers that travel between all possible airport pairs (see S1 Appendix). The total number
of passengers to Acre by state of origin during the period of study is depicted in Fig 1.
Commutation data (Mobility).
To obtain an estimate of the flow of individuals between
municipalities in Acre, we used data from the 2010 Brazilian Census [30]. In this dataset,
respondents were asked to provide the country, state, and municipality of work/study. A frac-
tion of them did not provide full information, that is, they mentioned working outside their
municipality of residence, but with no further specification of state or municipality; some only
provided destination state, but no specification of the municipality. To compensate for that,
for each city of residence we aggregated all entries with the same level of information, (i) dis-
placement only, (ii) destination state only, and (iii) complete information. With that, we pro-
portionally assigned a destination municipality based on the distribution for the particular
subset of the entries with full information.
The mobility network is built from the combination of commutation and flight data. In this
network, each municipality is represented by a node while edges represent the average daily
flow of individuals between pairs. To estimate this quantity, we summed the estimated daily
number of residents moving from one municipality to another for work and/or study over the
year, given by the commutation data, with the average daily number of flight passengers in
2010.
Assessing how Acre’s vulnerability to dengue importation changed from
2001 to 2012
Within our conceptual framework, vulnerability was defined in terms of the exposure of the
focal population to imported dengue cases. Here, we measured vulnerability as the expected
probability of dengue importation from other Brazilian states into Acre, by air transportation.
The usage of national airline passengers database is of great interest for the study of human
interaction dynamics within a country, particularly for the study of potential disease transmis-
sion routes. The flow of individuals between different regions allows agents that became
infected in one area to carry the pathogen to another area within his/her path [8, 11, 17, 18, 26,
31]. This mechanism serves as a driver for the (re-)introduction of pathogens throughout the
national territory. In this context, we analyzed Brazilian airline grid to estimate passenger flow
between Brazilian states and how this potential risk for the spreading of dengue to Acre varied
since the year 2000.
From the Brazilian airline database collected from 2001 to 2012, we estimated the daily
probability of an individual from state i traveling to state j for each month m, πij,m (see S1
Appendix). Coupling this probability with the reported number of dengue cases in each state
in the corresponding time window, we estimated the risk of each one state being the source of
an imported dengue case to any other in the Brazilian territory. This framework allows us to
estimate the most probable routes of case importation in each year to Acre.
Say we have ki,m dengue cases reported in state i in month m. Each k of the ki,m infected
individuals stays τk days as infectious, with an average of 4.5 [1.9–7.9] days [32]. Given the
daily probability of travel πij,m, τk is also the number of monthly trials for the probability of an

This construction allows us to provide a ranking of states by their probability of exporting a
dengue-infected individual to Acre, that is, the most probable sources of case importation at
any given epidemiological year. It also allows us to estimate the source-independent yearly
dengue importation probability, that is, the probability of at least one importation to Acre in a
given year regardless of its state of origin, which can be written as:

This quantity describes the temporal dynamics of the Acre’s overall exposure to dengue-
infected individuals. To take into account the uncertainty regarding the length of the infectious
period, the results shown correspond to the average over 1000 simulations of this process
using a gamma distribution with mean of 4.5 and 95% confidence interval of [1.9–7.9] for the
infectious period of each reported case.
Establishment of dengue transmission in the Acrean cities
The earliest evidence of the onset of disease establishment is the occurrence of autochthonous
cases, which are ascertained based on investigations of the travel history of the patients. Sec-
ondly, the presence of clusters or transmission chains is indicative of further transmission.
Thirdly, if the transmission is sustained, the incidence curve will increase at an exponential (or
subexponential) rate, characterizing an epidemic [33]. The available dengue notification data
do not have information on travel history or clustering of the reported cases. Here, evidence of
transmission is indirectly obtained from the notification data via the calculation of the effective
reproductive number, Rt. This index is interpreted as the average number of secondary cases
generated by a primary case at time t [34], calculated as the ratio of secondary to primary
cases. A value of Rt > 1 indicates a sustained growth of incidence. Since no information is
available on who infected whom, the primary cases are inferred from the generation interval of
dengue, that is, primary cases are those that could be the source of transmission for the current
cases given the time between the onset of their disease symptoms. This approach formally
described by Wallinga & Lipsitch [34] results in the following expression for Rt:
Rt

where b(t) is the number of new cases reported at week t and g(a) is the probability distribution
of the dengue generation interval (time between onset of symptoms in a primary case and
onset of symptoms in a secondary case) taken as a Normal distribution N (μ = 3weeks, σ =
1week). Confidence intervals for the ratio of two Poisson counts were calculated using the
method described in [35] and Rt > 1 was ascertained if p(Rt > 1) > 0.95.

 The effective reproductive number Rt was calculated weekly for each city, from 2000 to
2015. For each city, an epidemiological year was classified as epidemic if Rt > 1 for at least
three consecutive weeks. A period of 3 weeks was chosen because it represents one generation
of dengue transmission. We further defined T3 as the time in weeks from July 2000 to the first
observation of three consecutive weeks with Rt > 1 in that city.
Assessing how vulnerability to dengue importation changed from 2000 to
2015 at the Acrean municipalities in response to changes in the
transportation network
In 2001, Acre witnessed its first dengue epidemic, in Rio Branco. Since then, dengue cases
have been recorded almost continuously and with great intensity in this municipality. Here we
investigate if the spread of dengue from Rio Branco to other municipalities in Acre was associ-
ated with the transportation network. First, we investigate if more central cities were invaded
earlier than peripheral ones, where centrality is defined as a property of the transportation net-
work (defined below). Secondly, we assessed whether cities closer to Rio Branco were invaded
before distant ones.
A structural transportation network was constructed as a graph with 22 nodes representing
the municipalities and 29 edges representing the connections between them by (paved,
unpaved or under maintenance) roads, waterways or airways, as described in the data subsec-
tion. In this network, the edges were considered as unweighted for most of the centrality met-
rics defined below. The only exception made was for the distance in kilometers from Rio
Branco, in which case each edge received a weight equal to the corresponding distance
between the connected nodes. We also constructed a mobility network with the same 22 nodes
but with a total of 87 edges. As described in the mobility data subsection, in this network the
edges are given weights equal to the sum of residents moving from one municipality to another
for work and/or study in both directions.
There are several measures of node centrality, the literature being rich with proposals for
both weighted and unweighted networks [36]. Each of those proposals focuses on a different
aspect of information flow and node properties, therefore producing potentially different node
ranks for each measure [37, 38]. Here, we considered the following centrality measures that
provide different interpretations in relation to dengue exposure:
• Betweenness centrality (B and Bw): in both unweighted and weighted networks, a node
with high betweenness centrality is expected to have a stronger role in the dissemination
of information in the network, acting as a bridge between different nodes that are not
directly connected. Therefore, they should have higher exposure to infectious diseases and
likely contribute to its dissemination in the network. This centrality measure is usually
more relevant in large, sparse networks, where those nodes act as bridges between differ-
ent regions of the network. As defined in [39], betweenness centrality measures the rele-
vance of a node regarding how many shortest paths in the network include that node.
We computed an unweighted betweenness measurement (B) for each node based on the
unweighted shortest path, that is, only based on the vicinity of cities in the structural
transportation network. The unweighted shortest path distance between any pair of nodes
is the minimum number of edges forming a connected path between them. In principle,
each pair of nodes can have more than one shortest path, that is, more than one way of
going from the origin node to the destination one with the same number of connected
edges. So, if sm,l is the total number of shortest paths from node m to node l, and sm,l(i) is
the number of those paths containing node i, then the unweighted betweenness centrality

We also computed a weighted betweenness centrality (Bw) using the concept of effective
distance [11] to calculate the shortest path between pairs of nodes in the mobility network.
Using this definition, the shortest path between any pair is related to the conditional prob-
ability of individuals moving through a particular path between that pair. As defined in
[11], the effective distance between any pair of nodes can be obtained through the follow-
ing steps:
First of all, for each connected pair of nodes i and j, with number of travelers from i to j
given by wij, define the conditional probability of moving from i to j, given that a person

The shortest path in effective distance between nodes m and l is then defined as that with

Finally, the weighted betweenness centrality Bw(i) is computed in the same way as in Eq 5,
where the shortest path is obtained from the effective distance definition as in Eq 9.
• Closeness centrality (C and Cw): measures how fast information can flow from a node to all
other nodes in the network [37, 38, 40]. In our context, it translates into how fast the patho-
gen can reach all nodes from a single source based on human mobility. In the case of the
unweighted transportation network, for each node i, C(i) was calculated as the inverse of the
sum over the unweighted shortest path distance between node i and all other nodes in the
network. The unweighted shortest path distance d(i, j) from node i to j is simply the mini-
mum number of edges forming a path along connected nodes between i and j.
The closeness centrality C(i) is given by

For the mobility network, we calculated the weighted closeness centrality Cw. We used the
approach by [38] where the weighted distance between any pair of connected nodes is given
by the inverse of the number of travelers in the corresponding edge. This is equivalent to
redefining the edges’ weight as the inverse of the number of passengers between the given

 nodes. Therefore, the higher the number of travelers in a given edge, the shorter the distance
between them. The weighted shortest path distance, dw(i, j), is then the connected path with
the lowest sum over the weighted distance between each pair on that path. Finally, the
weighted centrality of node i, Cw(i) is the inverse of the sum over dw(i, j) from i to every
other node in the network, analogous to Eq 10. Therefore, the higher the number of passen-
gers in the shortest paths from a node, the higher its closeness centrality.
• Strength centrality (Sw): this measure is the weighted analog of degree centrality, which is
simply the node degree. For weighted networks, strength centrality measures the intensity
of the connections of a node, not only their number [41]. Here, Sw was calculated as the
total number of people regularly commuting to a given city for work or study. The higher a
node’s strength, the more it shares individuals with neighboring nodes, potentially increas-
ing its exposure to infected agents present in its network vicinity.
• Eigenvector centrality (Ew): as defined by Bonacich [42], the centrality of a node is defined by
the centrality of its neighbors. Therefore, the centrality of a node can be measured by the
combination of its connectivity and that of its neighbors. In this sense, the more connections
a node have with highly connected nodes, the more likely it is to be exposed to infected
agents from a random source. In the case of weighted networks, a node will have high eigen-
vector centrality (Ew) if it has strong connections with highly connected nodes taking into
account the weight of those edges. The weight used for this centrality measure is the number
of travelers between nodes.
From the weighted adjacency matrix W, the eigenvector centrality Ew(i) of each node i is
given by the ith entry of the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue of matrix W.
• Network Distance from Rio Branco (D, Dw): Rio Branco is the municipality with the strongest
communication with the rest of the country. The closest (farthest) a node is to Rio Branco,
the faster (slower) should be for infection from outside the state of Acre to reach this node
once it is introduced in Rio Branco [43]. From structural transportation network, we com-
puted the distance in degrees from Rio Branco (D) to a given node i as the unweighted shortest
path distance from Rio Branco to that municipality. For the mobility network, we computed
the effective distance from Rio Branco, Dw to each node i, which relates distance with the
probability of individuals flowing from Rio Branco to the target node in 2010. For the calcu-
lations of D, two edges were disregarded: the waterway connections between RB-Xpr (Rio
Branco-Xapuri) and Xpr-Brl (Xapuri-Brasile
´ia), because they have weak traffic [44] in com-
parison to the roadway route.
• Distance in kilometers from Rio Branco (Dk): this measure is calculated as the sum of kilometers
in each of the edges in the shortest path from Rio Branco to each target node in the structural
transportation network. In the case of connections where both terrestrial and pluvial routes
were available between a pair of nodes, we used the former since it is the most frequently used.
To access how vulnerability to dengue importation changed in the study time at the
Acrean municipalities in response to changes in the transportation network, we measured,
using Spearman correlations, the intensity of the relationship between T3 to the network
descriptors and compare to the structural state of the transportation network during the
period of study. While the descriptors for the mobility network are static since we only have
the flow of individuals for the year of 2010, the analysis of the transportation network status
is dynamic since there were considerable interventions such as construction and paving of
roadways during the period of study. We hypothesize that T3 and the descriptors should be
correlated since the road changes in the Acrean network is very evident, and the invasion of

 dengue in the state occurred first in the nearest municipalities in terms of distance and with
better road structure.
The analysis were performed in software R 3.3.2 (R Core Team, 2016, cran.r-project.org/)
and in Python 3.5 (Python Software Foundation, www.python.org) using the libraries Net-
workx [45], Pandas [46], Numpy [47], and igraph [48].
Receptivity of the Acrean cities to dengue transmission
Receptivity depends on the presence, abundance and vectorial capacity of the local population
of Ae. aegypti. Moreover, dengue receptivity has been linked to unplanned urbanization, fast
population growth, poor infrastructure as lack of urban services and effective mosquito con-
trol, and globalization [49]. Here, we review the available information on these topics in order
to provide the best description possible for the evolution of dengue receptivity in the study
period. First, we investigated the available records of Ae. aegypti presence in the region using
LI/LIRAa. From this data, we computed the year when Ae. aegypti was first recorded in each
municipality.
Secondly, we computed how much each municipality changed from 2000 to 2010, in terms
of population growth, urbanization, garbage collection, water supply and sanitary sewage.
We also reviewed the scientific literature searching any biological information regarding
the vector populations found in Acre. The literature is scarce, and a single study was found on
the competence of Acrean Ae. aegypti to DENV-2 [50].
Results
Vulnerability to dengue importation to Acre
From 2001 to 2012, the overall flow of passengers to Acre increased from about 50,000 to more
than 150,000 passengers per year. During this period, the main states of origin for travelers to
Acre were Distrito Federal (DF), Rondo
ˆnia (RO), Amazonas (AM) and São Paulo (SP) (Fig 1).
Meanwhile, the states of Rio de Janeiro (RJ), São Paulo, Minas Gerais (MG) and Bahia (BA)
had the highest dengue cases recorded. As discussed in the methods section, the probability of
case importation to Acre is a combination of both the number of travelers and dengue activity.
Fig 2 shows the probability of dengue case importation into Acre from 2001/2002 to 2011/
2012. It reached ca. 70% in 2001/2002, reducing to its lowest level (38%) in 2003/2004, steadily
increasing to ca. 100% from 2004/2005 to 2007/2008, remaining so until the end of the study
period. The north region was found as the main source of dengue cases to Acre, in particular,
the neighboring state of Rondo
ˆnia (RO), followed by the center-west (Distrito Federal-DF and
Mato Grosso-MT), southeast (Rio de Janeiro-RJ and São Paulo-SP), and northeast (Ceara
´-
CE). The contribution of Rondo
ˆnia, Distrito Federal and Mato Grosso to the exportation of
dengue to Acre was mainly associated with the flow intensity between these states while that of
Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo was a result of the combination of moderate flow intensity and
high rates of dengue activity. Others states such as Tocantins (TO), Roraima (RR) and Amapa
´
(AP) in the north, Maranhão (MA), Piauı
´ (PI), Paraı
´ba (PB) and Alagoas (AL) in the east and
all states in the south region were unlikely exporters of dengue cases to Acre due to the combi-
nation of low flow and low dengue activity.
Dengue establishment in the Acrean municipalities
The first autochthonous dengue case was reported in Acre in 2000. From this year until 2008,
the annual incidence did not exceed 900 cases per 100,000 inhabitants, a level of activity similar
to those found in the other northern states of Brazil, except for Roraima. However, in 2009

 there was a significant increase in dengue incidence in Acre when it tripled to an alarming
level of 2,800 cases per 100,000. In 2010, dengue incidence was even higher: 4,793.3 cases per
100,000 [51]. According to the Ministry of Health, in 2011, Acre was among the states classi-
fied as at moderate risk, and within the state, the capital Rio Branco was classified as at the
highest risk [52]. On the other hand, the Alto Jurua
´ region, in the northwest of Acre, which
until 2014 had not yet registered autochthonous cases of dengue, witnessed its first dengue epi-
demic in Cruzeiro do Sul. In 2014, Cruzeiro do Sul was among the municipalities with the
highest number of dengue cases between the epidemiological weeks 01 and 47 of 2014. Com-
pared to 2013, the number of cases jumped from 30 cases to 23,130 [53, 54].
In Fig 3 we show the weeks with Rt > 1, from 2000 to 2015 at each Acrean municipality. A
sequence of weeks with Rt > 1 is an indication of epidemic growth. All municipalities pre-
sented this event at least once during the study period. The municipalities that presented the
lowest percentages of weeks with Rt > 1 were Porto Walter (PW) and Jordão (Jrd) (1.15% for
both) throughout the study period. These are the two most peripheral in the state, and whose
access includes a stretch traveled by river. The ones with the highest percentages of “epidemic
weeks” were Rio Branco (RB, 9.32%), Senador Guiomard (SG, 6.39%), Epitaciola
ˆndia (Epcd),
and Brasile
´ia (Brl) (6.00% for both).
In Fig 3, colors indicate the main type of access to each city. There are two main types of
access, those cities in which access is by road (black and orange) and those in which the final
access is by waterway (blue). Before 2008/2009, only cities in which access is by road registered
Rt > 1. However, these records were mostly intermittent, as can be seen for example in Bujari
(Bjr), Capixaba (Cpb), Assis Brasil (AB), Porto Acre (PA), Acrela
ˆndia (Acld), Pla
´cido de Cas-
tro (PC) and Xapuri (Xpr). Cruzeiro do Sul (CZS) in gray, which is the only city served by
an airline to Rio Branco, also registered few weeks with Rt > 1 before 2008. After this year,

 when several paving works and road maintenance were concluded, the frequency increased
eventually becoming more intense culminating with CZS recording the first sustained epi-
demic in 2014. The time frame of infrastructural changes and its potential impact on dengue
cases notification is discussed in more detail in the section Dengue spread in Acre. The munic-
ipalities in orange, Ma
ˆncio Lima (ML), Rodrigues Alves (RA), Tarauaca
´ (Trc) and Manoel
Urbano (MU), also have access by road, but part of the final access was under construction or
maintenance during all or almost all the period of study. In these municipalities, as well as in
those with final access by waterway, the first records of Rt > 1 occurred in the beginning of
2008, in a slow way, while in those cities with access by waterway, the records were even rarer
than those accessible by roads.

 Vulnerability to dengue importation within Acre
Public investments since 2000 in the development of the Acrean transportation infrastructure,
including the construction of the Pacific Highway and the pavement of intermunicipal roads,
have brought more connectivity between the municipalities, in particular within southeast
Acre, composed by Rio Branco, Senador Guiomard, Capixaba, Xapuri, Epitaciola
ˆndia, Pla
´cido
de Castro, Brasile
´ia, and Acrela
ˆndia. In contrast, transportation and mobility between the
southeast and other regions of Acre (Alto Jurua
´) is still very difficult due to road conditions,
although improvements have occurred during this period. The accessibility to the northwest
area of Acre began to improve after the year 2008, when paving of the highway BR-364 in the
region of Manuel Urbano (MU) and Feijo
´ (Fj), in the central area of Acre. Highway BR-364 is
the only one that crosses the state from Acrela
ˆndia (Acl, in the southeast) to Ma
ˆncio Lima
(ML, in the northwest) and connects Acre to the rest of Brazil via Rondo
ˆnia state.
Highway BR-364 has been under construction since the beginning of the last decade. In
southeast Acre the paving and restoration of this highway were completed quickly, and only
the stretch from Acrela
ˆndia to Rio Branco was still under construction until 2007/2008. The
stretch from the capital to Cruzeiro do Sul, at the northwest part of the state, passes through
very unstable soil, making it difficult to maintain during the monsoon season. Only in 2012/
2013, this stretch was completely paved, but in the following years repairment works were
needed. Besides this highway, an extremely important link between the southeast and north-
west Acre is the daily flight between Rio Branco and Cruzeiro do Sul, which increased by 18%
from 2001 to 2012. The most remote municipalities are Santa Rosa do Purus, Jordão, Marechal
Thaumaturgo and Porto Walter with very limited access and only by river, most of them only
by small and medium-sized vessels depending on the time of year. On the other hand, air
travel alone was responsible for an average of 134 passengers to Acre per day during the epide-
miological year 2001/2002, steadily increasing to almost 500 per day in 2013/2014, most of
them to Rio Branco, responsible for approximately 90% of all air travel to Acre from other Bra-
zilian states. To illustrate the impact of interstate airflow in this population, the 2010 Census
registered 3.6 thousand commuters to Rio Branco, so that the average daily out-of-state air
passengers corresponded to almost 4% of daily commuters in 2001/2002, up to almost 14% in
that of 2013/2014. This data contrasts with the common misconception regarding air travel to
Acre and its impact to information inflow, which is believed to be negligible due to its rela-
tively low volume with respect to the rest of the Country.
The connectivity between municipalities is shown in Fig 4. We used Cytoscape software
[55] to build a representation of the Acrean municipalities’ mobility network, with edge width
and color proportional to the natural logarithm of the daily number of travelers and node size
proportional to the natural logarithm of each municipality’s population (node color indicate
access mode, as in Fig 3). Nodes position are defined based on the Fruchterman–Reingold
algorithm [56], which is a force-directed layout widely used in network visualization. In this
layout, all nodes have a repulsion force between them, while edges weight are used as an attrac-
tive force between connected nodes. Nodes that share stronger connections, i.e., with more
travelers, are placed closer to each other than those that share weaker or no connection. There-
fore, groups of nodes sharing stronger bonds among them form regional clusters in this
abstract space of connectivity. This particular visualization facilitates the detection of munici-
palities that share relatively strong bonds even when geographically far apart. On the other
hand, nodes that are placed on the periphery with this algorithm are those that have relatively
few and/or weak connections. We can see that the two most populous municipalities, the
capital Rio Branco (RB) and Cruzeiro do Sul (CZS), are important hubs in this network. The
access mode (waterway, paved and unpaved roads, airway) confers a natural clustering on the

 mobility network, suggesting an intuitive relationship between ease of access (transportation
network) and the number of travelers (mobility network). Municipalities accessed by paved
roads are more densely connected with each other, while the strong connection between Rio
Branco and Cruzeiro do Sul, which are connected by airports, considerably shortens the effec-
tive distance between east and west side of the state. Another example of this relationship is
the fact that municipalities which are mainly accessed via waterways are peripheral in the
mobility network. In fact, Marechal Thaumaturgo (MT), Jordão (Jrd) and Santa Rosa dos
Purus (SRP) have the lowest Ew, Cw and Sw centralities, with Porto Walter (PW) also among
the five municipalities with lowest values for those centralities.
The capital Rio Branco is the most central node in the Acrean network with respect to all
descriptors used (see in S2 Appendix) being the most present node in all shortest paths (as
measured by B and Bw); the municipality with the smallest average shortest path to all other
nodes (C and Cw); the strongest attractor (Ew) in the network; and the node with most

proportional to the natural logarithm of the population. Edges represent the average flow of individuals
between municipalities, with width and color proportional to the natural logarithm of the number of travelers.
Node color follows the same criteria as in Fig 3: (black) municipalities connected by paved roads, (gray)

maintenance sections during the period of study, (blue) municipalities that are mainly accessed by river.

 travelers (Sw). Therefore, it is both the most vulnerable to exposure from a pathogen present
in the state at a random municipality, as well as the node which poses the highest impact in
other municipalities’ vulnerability once infected. Porto Acre, Bujari and Senador Guiomard,
all with geographical borders with Rio Branco, also present high centrality measures, therefore
sharing similar relevance to disease transmission. All of those cities are located on the east side
of the state, and all of them can be accessed via paved federal highway.
Another municipality with high centrality for most indicators is Cruzeiro do Sul (CZS), on
the west side of Acre. Although geographically distant from Rio Branco, this municipality
shares an airport connection with the capital, drawing a significant amount of travelers and
therefore shortening its network distance with respect to individual flow. Being the second
most populous municipality, it also shares strong connectivity with its geographical neighbors.
In fact, it has the third highest strength centrality, that is, the third municipality with highest
number of travelers. Due to its connectivity to Rio Branco and its role as western hub, Cruzeiro
do Sul acts as an important bridge between the capital and the western region.
Dengue spread in Acre
In Fig 5 we can observe a sequence of panels showing how dengue invaded and established
itself in Acre, following the transportation network. The nodes represent the cities, colored
according to the number of consecutive weeks with Rt > 1 per year. In this study, we consider
“at least three consecutive weeks with Rt > 1” as a marker of (at least temporary) disease estab-
lishment. Of the 22 Acre counties, nine were positive for this marker at least once during the
study period despite the fact that all of them registered at least one case of dengue during this
time. Until 2008/2009, only Rio Branco e Sena Madureira had evidence of disease establish-
ment according to this criterion. The two cities are well connected in terms of human mobility,
close regarding geographical distance, and have paved roads connecting them. At the end of
the study period, other seven cities presented at least three consecutive weeks with Rt > 1. Of
those, six are in southeast Acre, in the most connected and best-accessed region. The other city
is Cruzeiro do Sul, one of the most distant cities in kilometers from Rio Branco, but populous
and with an air connection to the capital.
We further investigate if there is evidence of correlation between the centrality of a
municipality and the time it took for dengue to establish itself, measured by T3, as defined
previously. A summary of the main results is shown in Table 1. This is an exploratory analy-
sis only, since the sample size is small for modeling. Strength centrality was the network
descriptor most negatively correlated with T3. This result suggests that municipalities in
which the sharing of individuals with other municipalities was larger had a greater exposure
to dengue and, consequently, smaller T3 than those with lower integration. The Eigenvector
centrality of the municipalities, which is related to how strong is the connectivity of a node’s
neighborhood, therefore its ability to concentrate population flow in the network, also pres-
ents negative correlation with T3. This is an intuitive result since this property enhances the
probability of a node being invaded once a node in its vicinity presents an outbreak, even
when not in direct contact. Finally, the distance from Rio Branco, measured by both the
effective distance and in kilometers, also showed high correlation with T3. It is interesting to
note that, geographical distance aside, topological properties of the unweighted structural
network are not significantly correlated with T3. It is important to highlight that about half
of the Acrean municipalities did not meet the criteria of dengue establishment, which has a
significant impact on the correlation obtained. With that in mind, we also investigated if
those network properties were correlated with the event of dengue establishment itself. In
Fig 6, we show boxplots comparing the centrality of municipalities that witnessed dengue

 establishment during the study period and those which did not. This comparison allows for
the evaluation of whether municipalities grouped by occurrence (YES/NO) are also charac-
terized by significantly distinct network properties. It is possible to identify that the descrip-
tors most correlated to T3 were also those that differed the most between municipalities with
and without dengue establishment, which are the geographical and effective distance to Rio
Branco, Eigenvector and Strength centralities.
Receptivity of the Acrean municipalities to dengue transmission
The first record of Ae. aegypti in Acre occurred in 1995 in Rio Branco [57] (Table 2). Gradually
the nearest municipalities in the southeast of the state also started recording it, and in 2001,
eight municipalities had confirmed the presence of Ae. aegypti. These municipalities are the
same municipalities where Rt > 1 was detected earlier in time, being municipalities along BR-
317 (SG, Cpb, Xpr, Epcd and Brl) or with a direct connection to RB (PA) and two with good
access to BR-364 since the beginning of the study (SM and Acld). From 2002 to 2006, another
three municipalities reported the presence of Ae. aegypti: Pla
´cido de Castro, Bujari and Assis
Brasil. Bujari is the nearest neighbor of Rio Branco, but Ae. aegypti presence was not confirmed
until 2006. It is difficult to ascertain the specific causes for this. On the one hand, this was a
predominantly rural municipality in the early 2000’s. On the other hand, there was not a well-
structured vector surveillance program implemented in small towns such as Bujari until later.
Pla
´cido de Castro and Assis Brasil are frontier municipalities, the former at the border with
Rondo
ˆnia state, receiving a considerable traffic of vehicles from the highly dengue endemic
neighbor state. It is reasonable to infer that Ae. aegypti could be present there previously but
unnoticed. However, dengue only established itself in Pla
´cido de Castro in 2012/2013, despite
the consistent detection of cases since 2001. Assis Brasil is a small town at the triple frontier
Brasil-Peru-Bolivia. In 2000, it had a considerably small population, which may have contrib-
uted to the delayed invasion of Ae. aegypti.
Between 2007 and 2013 no other city reported the presence of Ae. aegypti. The only excep-
tion being Cruzeiro do Sul, in 2008. This invasion was interrupted, however, and the mosquito
was detected again only in 2013 [58]. From the municipalities to the north of Sena Madureira
along the BR-364 highway, four confirmed the presence of Ae. aegypti in 2015: Feijo
´, Tarauaca
´,
Ma
ˆncio Lima and Porto Walter. The first three, together with Cruzeiro do Sul, are located
along the BR-364 and are important stopping points for those traveling. For the same reason,
it is not possible to affirm that the mosquito was actually absent before that, since monitoring
was not implemented. Five municipalities remained Ae. aegypti free as of 2015, according to

 the LI/LIRAa dataset (Table 2). These are the most peripheral municipalities of Acre, and also
the most rural.
Structural characteristics of Acrean municipalities can be part of the explanation for the
slow invasion and establishment of Ae. aegypti in the state. According to IBGE’s urban/rural
classification, Acre is mostly a rural state, but the population of all municipalities and the per-
centage of urbanization increased from 2000 to 2010. The exceptions are two, Rodrigues Alves
and Assis Brasil, where total population increased as well but the urban population decreased

 [25]. Both municipalities presented an increase in the number of rural settlements [59]. Popu-
lation growth, coupled with the increase in urbanization without improving the coverage of
general services—such as garbage collection, water supply and sanitary sewage (Table 2) –,
contribute to the fact that, even in a more rural state, the ideal conditions for establishing the
mosquito are guaranteed. Those characteristics increase the difficulty in controlling Ae. aegypti
[50] and consequently the local receptivity.
Discussion
In the process of describing the introduction of dengue in Acre, we assessed the contribution of
network metrics and reproductive numbers as indicators of vulnerability, disease establishment

 and receptivity in the study of disease emergence. In the landscape epidemiology of infectious
diseases, the description of the temporal dynamics of the populations of hosts, vectors, and
pathogens, all spatially interacting in a favorable environment, contributes to the understand-
ing of what characteristics and factors favor disease transmission an establishment [60]. Even
small differences in landscape composition, which are often unapparent, can alter the micro-
habitats of the vector and thus the conditions that allow the amplification of a pathogen [60].
In addition, the dispersion of pathogens and vectors is directly linked to the development of
transportation networks and increased globalization [49]. In this context, human population
expansion has significantly affected the epidemiology of vector-borne diseases, creating a large
urban continuum, altering the landscape structure and providing rapid mechanisms for hosts
and pathogens to disperse [60].
The results of this study suggest that the landscape changes that occurred in the last decade
have created favorable conditions for the establishment of dengue virus transmission, bringing
together all the fundamental factors for its occurrence: the man, the virus, the vector, and espe-
cially the environmental, political, economic, social and cultural conditions favorable for the
establishment of the transmission chain [61]. In Acre, the revitalization of its major roads, as
well as the increased accessibility by air both to and within the state, have increased dengue
vulnerability. Notice that the increase in the flow of people and importation of dengue cases to
Acre coincides with when disease dispersion becomes more pronounced within the state, sug-
gesting a synergy between increasing vulnerability of the state at a global scale and increasing
local vulnerability among municipalities, fueling viral spread in the region. Human mobility is
responsible for viral spreading, as both asymptomatic humans or those with very mild symp-
toms continue to carry out their tasks and take the virus to other regions. Humans are also
responsible for possibly transporting the mosquito itself (which can be infected or not) by air,
road, and waterway [2, 7, 62].
Some network descriptors used in this study were useful for characterizing the level of cen-
trality/periphery of the Acrean municipalities and its relationship with dengue importation.
The mobility network that connects the Acrean counties is small and dense—22 nodes and
density 0.38 –, so centrality measures such as betweenness (B and Bw) and closeness (C and
Cw) were not as relevant as they would be in larger and sparser networks. However, the
strength (S) was the most relevant of the descriptors, because, in a small network, the relation-
ship between local and global characteristics are stronger. Rio Branco is the main attractor of
the state, with highest and strongest connectivity within Acre, since most of the routes con-
necting municipalities in the northwest to the southeast region pass by the capital. Also, it is a
reference center for the entire state. A node with high connectivity, that is, a node to which
many others connect to and where there are many outputs, is an essential node for the propa-
gation of infectious diseases [63]. Therefore, investing in dengue control and prevention in a
systematic manner in Rio Branco has potentially a strong impact throughout the state, not
only because of its connectivity within Acre but also because this city is the main port-of-entry
from other Brazilian states.
The structure of the network, the distribution of degrees between nodes and the main
routes are known to impact the spread of diseases [64]. In fact, we can observe that dengue
first spread in the vicinity of Rio Branco and then, after an extended period of time, approxi-
mately 13 years, the first event of sustained transmission (here defined as at least three conse-
cutive weeks with Rt > 1) occurred in Cruzeiro do Sul. The flow of people by air between Rio
Branco and Cruzeiro do Sul, and the improvement of the BR-364 were very significant predic-
tors of this first epidemic in the northwest region of Acre. Although Cruzeiro do Sul confirmed
the presence of the Ae. aegypti only in 2008 [58], ever since the beginning of the study there
were records of cases in the municipality, even when there were no records in intermediate

 connections by road between both municipalities. This last result highlights the importance of
the airline connection between them for dengue case importation.
The mobility data used in the present work is from the 2010 Census [30] when the struc-
tural network around Cruzeiro do Sul and Rio Branco was already stabilized regarding paving
and maintenance, as shown in Fig 5. Since dengue epidemiological year of 2009/2010, all
roadways directly connected to those two hubs had their maintenance concluded. Also, the
unpaved connections to and from Manoel Urbano, which is structurally in between the two
Acrean hubs, had also improved by that time. Most of its paving work was concluded by the
end of 2010, although maintenance works continued for the rest of the study period. Despite
the unavailability of detailed movement for performing a rigorous analysis, it is to be expected
that during the period with unpaved and with major maintenance works in the roadways the
flow of individuals was lower than when those structural bottlenecks were resolved. Therefore,
we expect that the 2010 mobility flux data is more representative of the work/study-related
movement from 2009 onwards. Before that, we conjecture that this particular type of human
mobility was more concentrated over those connections with paved roads and without major
maintenance work.
The structural network status evolution depicted in Fig 5 allows us to identify a few key fac-
tors regarding the temporal evolution of ease of access and dengue case notification. Up until
epidemiological year 2009/2010, when paved roads (black edges in that network) were mainly
present in the vicinity of Rio Branco, the occurrence of Rt > 1 was also mostly present in that
area—which can be identified by node’s color in Fig 5 as well as by the markings in Fig 3. In
the area surrounding Cruzeiro do Sul, which was mainly connected by waterways (dashed
blue edges) and roads under maintenance (orange edges), before 2007/2008 the occurrence of
Rt > 1 was registered only once at Ma
ˆncio Lima (ML) and a few times in Cruzeiro do Sul.
These results reinforce the hypothesis that those cases notified in Cruzeiro do Sul were most
likely imported cases from Rio Branco due to the airline connection. It is interesting to note
that in terms of roadways, the path from Rio Branco to Cruzeiro do Sul had a structural bottle-
neck at Manoel Urbano (MU) since it was only accessed by means of unpaved road (red
edges) up to 2007/2008.
Improvements in the structural network started in 2008/2009, which included paving and
maintenance work of the roadways around Manoel Urbano, and were consolidated in 2009/
2010 with the conclusion of major maintenance work in the roadways directly connected to
both Rio Branco and Cruzeiro do Sul. We can see that is was precisely after those improve-
ments that dengue notifications started to occur throughout the state of Acre, as well as the
number of consecutive weeks with Rt > 1 in each municipality. The combination of low occur-
rence of Rt > 1 during the years with unpaved and under maintenance roadways, and the
increased observation of Rt > 1 after improvements were implemented reinforces the hypothe-
sis that the human mobility network and the structural changes were relevant to the observed
geographical spread of the virus in the state of Acre.
As for demographic characteristics, Acrean municipalities are marked by having small pop-
ulations (Table 2). The capital Rio Branco, the one with the largest population, has 336,038
inhabitants [25]. The second largest municipality in population size is Cruzeiro do Sul, with
78,507. The remaining ones do not exceed 40,000 inhabitants, the majority of them having less
than 20,000 inhabitants. The peripheral municipalities according to the network descriptors
are also those with the smallest populations and are, mostly, more rural than urban. These
municipalities are less vulnerable and less receptive to dengue, which is seen by the low occur-
rence of Rt > 1 and no event of sustained transmission as defined in this study. Nonetheless, in
the world, there has been increased reporting of Ae. aegypti invasion and dengue introduction
in less urbanized areas. In Colombia, dengue-infected Ae. aegypti was found in rural regions

 [65] south of Bogota
´. In Nicaragua, a study showed the unsuspected presence of dengue cases
in those areas as well [66].
These results from the literature and the results shown in the present manuscript suggest
that introduction and establishment of dengue in those peripheral areas of Acre could be just a
matter of time, especially since the virus has already been able to establish itself in the state.
Overall, with this study, we understand that the determination of vulnerable and receptive
localities for dengue in the state of Acre is essential for an effective action of entomological and
epidemiological surveillance. It is fundamental that all municipalities, especially those with a
roadway link, systematically monitor mosquito infestation, which is not currently the case.
In addition, favorable conditions for mosquito development are present in Acrean municipali-
ties, with low coverage of services, climate and increased urbanization [25], which probably
impacts on the availability of breeding sites for Ae. aegypti and its establishment. Acre has a
humid equatorial climate, which may contribute to the transmission of the dengue virus
occurring throughout the year. According to [50], the mosquitoes of the region have the vecto-
rial competence to transmit the DENV-2. Unfortunately, we did not find more biological
information on the mosquito populations of Acre. We can conclude that Acre is a state at risk
of major dengue epidemics, with entire populations susceptible to all serotypes of the disease.
Due to the limited data and number of municipalities, our analysis is more descriptive/qualita-
tive than quantitative. Nonetheless, we believe that the descriptors discussed here as well as the
methodological approach has proved a valuable way to assess invasion risk which can be easily
expanded to larger areas—conditioned on data availability –, allowing for a more quantitative
analysis..
