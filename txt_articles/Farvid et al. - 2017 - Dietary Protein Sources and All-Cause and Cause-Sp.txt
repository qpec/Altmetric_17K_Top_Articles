Abstract
Introduction—Dietary protein comes from foods with greatly different compositions that may 
not relate equally with mortality risk. Few cohort studies from non-Western countries have 
examined the association between various dietary protein sources and cause-specific mortality.

 Therefore, the associations between dietary protein sources and all-cause, cardiovascular disease, 
and cancer mortality were evaluated in the Golestan Cohort Study in Iran.
Methods—Among 42,403 men and women who completed a dietary questionnaire at baseline, 
3,291 deaths were documented during 11 years of follow up (2004–2015). Cox proportional 
hazards models estimated age-adjusted and multivariate-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs 
for all- cause and disease-specific mortality in relation to dietary protein sources. Data were 
analyzed from 2015 to 2016.
Results—Comparing the highest versus the lowest quartile, egg consumption was associated 
with lower all-cause mortality risk (HR=0.88, 95% CI=0.79, 0.97, ptrend=0.03). In multivariate 
analysis, the highest versus the lowest quartile of fish consumption was associated with reduced 
risk of total cancer (HR=0.79, 95% CI=0.64, 0.98, ptrend=0.03) and gastrointestinal cancer 
(HR=0.75, 95% CI=0.56, 1.00, ptrend=0.02) mortality. The highest versus the lowest quintile of 
legume consumption was associated with reduced total cancer (HR=0.72, 95% CI=0.58, 0.89, 
ptrend=0.004), gastrointestinal cancer (HR=0.76, 95% CI=0.58, 1.01, ptrend=0.05), and other cancer 
(HR=0.66, 95% CI=0.47, 0.93, ptrend=0.04) mortality. Significant associations between total red 
meat and poultry intake and all- cause, cardiovascular disease, or cancer mortality rate were not 
observed among all participants.
Conclusions—These findings support an association of higher fish and legume consumption 
with lower cancer mortality, and higher egg consumption with lower all-cause mortality.
INTRODUCTION
Red meat and processed meat consumption may contribute to increased risk of several 
chronic diseases such as diabetes,1 cardiovascular disease (CVD)1, and certain cancers.2–6 
Prospective studies have noted increased mortality risk among men and women with high 
total and processed red meat consumption,7,8 whereas poultry and fish are often considered 
healthier substitutes for red meat. Current evidence supports the relationship between fish 
consumption and lower all-cause or coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality risk,9,10 
whereas the role of fish intake in cancer mortality is unclear.11–13 Findings from prospective 
studies relating poultry to mortality risk are inconsistent.12,14,15 The roles of other dietary 
protein sources such as eggs or legumes in mortality risk are less clear.16,17 Further, most of 
the results in relation to red meat consumption and mortality were from Western countries, 
where high red meat consumption is common. However, Iranian people consume less red 
meat: 9.2 kg per capita compared with 65.3 and 58.3 kg per capita among American or 
European populations, respectively.18 Therefore, to examine the association between red 
meat and mortality and to show the effect of other protein sources on mortality, the 
association of red meat, poultry, fish, eggs, and legumes consumption with mortality risk 
from all and specific causes was investigated, using data from a prospective cohort study of 
adult men and women in Golestan, Iran.

 METHODS
Study Population
The Golestan Cohort Study is an ongoing prospective population- based study established in 
2004 in Iran with enrollment of 50,045 participants (21,234 men and 28,811 women) aged 
36–85 years, without previous history of upper gastrointestinal cancer, from Gonbad city 
and 326 villages in Golestan province. The study design is described in further detail 
elsewhere.19 This analysis included participants who had data on dietary intake (n=49,112) 
at baseline. Participants were excluded owing to loss of follow up (n=63); extreme total 
energy intake (<600 or >4,200 kcal/day, n=436); or prior diagnosis of chronic disease, 
including cancer, diabetes, CHD, or stroke (n=6,210), leaving 42,403 participants (18,261 
men and 24,142 women).
This study was approved by the IRBs of the Digestive Disease Research Center of Tehran 
University of Medical Sciences, the U.S. National Cancer Institute, the WHO International 
Agency for Research on Cancer, and the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. All 
participants gave written informed consent before enrollment.
Measures
At enrollment, dietary intake was measured by face-to-face interviews using a validated, 
116-item food frequency questionnaire specifically designed for this population.20 Total red 
meat items listed on the food frequency questionnaire included unprocessed (beef or lamb, 
hamburger) and processed (sausage) red meat; poultry included chicken; fish included tuna, 
stellate sturgeon, carp, smoked fish, salted fish, and other fish; and legumes included 
soybeans, beans, lentils, peas, and split peas. Participants were asked about the frequency of 
food item consumption per day, week, month, or year. The standard serving sizes for these 
food items were 85 g for cooked beef, lamb, hamburger, chicken, and fish; 45 g for sausage; 
100 g for cooked beans, lentils, peas, split peas, and soybeans; and 54 g for eggs. Iranian21 
and U.S. Department of Agriculture22 databases were used to calculate daily energy intake.
Data on lifestyle variables and medical history were obtained through face-to-face 
interviews using a general questionnaire at the beginning of the study. Participants were 
asked about gender, age, ethnicity, residential history, occupation, education, smoking 
habits, opium use, alcohol consumption, indicators of SES, and medical history including 
self-reports of medically diagnosed diabetes mellitus, heart disease, stroke, and cancer. 
Height and weight were then measured. Blood pressure in both arms was also measured 
twice at a 10-minute interval. Occupational physical activity was measured in four levels: 
Level 1 activities defined as sedentary work mostly done while sitting (e.g., driving); Level 2 
activities defined as standing or occasional walking (e.g., teaching); Level 3 activities 
defined as mainly indoor activities causing a mild increase in heart rate and sweating (e.g., 
housekeeping); and Level 4 activities defined as those causing a significant increase in heart 
rate and sweating usually performed outdoors (e.g., farming).23 Using multiple 
correspondence analysis, the wealth score was created based on occupation, house 
ownership, house structure, house size, having a bath in the residence, as well as a personal

 car, motorbike, black/white TV, color TV, refrigerator, freezer, vacuum, and washing 
machine.24
Deaths were reported by family members, friends, or local health workers during annual 
telephone calls. When a death was reported, a physician visited the house to complete a 
validated verbal autopsy questionnaire by interviewing the next of kin.25 Relevant medical 
documents including medical charts, radiography and pathology reports, and hospital 
discharge reports were gathered from the hospitals or pathology centers. All collected 
documents were reviewed, and the cause of death was coded according to the ICD-10. In 
this analysis, deaths were classified as due to CVD (ICD-I00–I99); CHD (ICD-I20–I52); 
stroke (ICD- I60–I69); cancer (ICD-C00–D48); gastrointestinal cancers (ICD- C15–26); and 
other cancers (ICD-C00–14, ICD-C30–97, and ICD- D00–48). If a final diagnosis could not 
be determined for any reason, the cause of death was classified as “unknown.”
Statistical Analysis
Data were analyzed from 2015 to 2016. Person-years of follow up were calculated from the 
date of completed questionnaires at baseline until death, or last follow-up date (until June 1, 
2015), which ever came first. Participants were divided into quintiles according to food 
group intake. Because of the low consumption of fish and eggs, participants who did not eat 
fish or eggs were assigned to the first category, and others were divided into tertiles. Cox 
proportional hazards regression was used to estimate age- adjusted and multivariate-adjusted 
hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs for all-cause and disease-specific mortality in relation to 
total red meat, poultry, fish, egg, and legume consumption. Multivariate models were 
adjusted for age, gender, place of residence, marital status, educational level, ethnicity, 
cigarette smoking, opium use, BMI, systolic blood pressure, family history of cancer, 
occupational physical activity, medication, wealth score, alcohol consumption, and total 
energy intake (footnotes in Tables 2–4 list categorizations). Tests for linear trend were 
carried out by assigning a median value for each quintile (or quartile) and modeling this as a 
continuous variable in the model. Missing covariate data, which included five participants 
for BMI and eight participants for systolic blood pressure, were replaced with median 
values. To address whether the observed associations were independent of other dietary 
intake, the analysis additionally controlled for fruit and vegetable or total grain intake. 
Furthermore, a previous study using data from the Golestan Cohort Study indicated that high 
consumption of low-fat dairy was associated with reduced mortality risk,26 so the 
associations were evaluated after additional adjustment for intake of low-fat dairy foods. By 
including a cross-product interaction term for gender, age, BMI, smoking, or wealth score, 
and dietary protein sources in the multivariate-adjusted model, this study examined whether 
the associations between dietary protein sources and all-cause mortality were modified by 
other mortality risk factors.27–29 The effect of substituting one serving/day of poultry, fish, 
legumes, or eggs for one serving/day of total red meat was estimated by including these food 
items simultaneously as continuous variables in the multivariate-adjusted model. The HRs 
and 95% CIs for the substitution effect were estimated from the difference between the 
regression coefficients, variances, and covariance.30 Stata, version 12, was used for all 
analyses. All p-values were two-sided.

 RESULTS
During 339,867 person-years of follow up (2004–2015; total, 11 years; median, 8.1 years), 
3,291 deaths were documented (1,938 deaths among men and 1,353 deaths among women) 
in the Golestan Cohort Study. A total of 1,467 deaths were from CVD (764 CHD deaths, 
507 stroke deaths, and 196 other CVD deaths) and 859 deaths were caused by cancer (509 
gastrointestinal cancer deaths and 350 other cancer deaths). Mean consumption of total red 
meat was 0.19 serving/day, which included 0.04 serving/day of processed red meat. 
Participants with higher total red meat intake were more likely to be male, Turkmen, 
married, and smokers, and to have higher BMI. Also, they were less likely to live in rural 
areas and perform higher levels of occupational physical activity (Table 1). The percentage 
of energy intake from each food group according to tertiles of total red meat intake was used 
to show changes in dietary habits by increasing consumption of total red meat: the higher 
total red meat intake, the lower percentage of energy intake from grains (Appendix Figure 1, 
available online).
Higher intake of total red meat as well as poultry, fish, and legumes was not associated with 
all-cause mortality risk (Table 2). The wealth score was responsible for most of the 
differences in HRs between age-adjusted and multivariate-adjusted models (data not shown). 
Higher egg consumption was associated with a lower all-cause mortality risk (HR [highest 
versus lowest] =0.88, 95% CI=0.79, 0.97, ptrend=0.03). Similar point estimates were 
observed after additional adjustment for fruit and vegetable, total grain food, or low-fat dairy 
food intake (data not shown). With mutual adjustment for dietary protein sources, a non-
significant positive association for total red meat intake was observed (HR=1.08, 95% 
CI=0.96, 1.22, ptrend=0.08). The association of egg intake was not changed materially 
(HR=0.88, 95% CI=0.80, 0.98, ptrend=0.045). Significant associations with poultry, legume, 
or fish intake were not noted.
Furthermore, substituting one serving/day of legumes for one serving/day of total red meat 
was associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality (HR=0.68, 95% CI=0.50, 0.93). 
Substituting one serving/day of eggs for one serving/day of total red meat was associated 
with a lower risk of all-cause mortality (HR=0.65, 95% CI=0.43, 0.98). Further, substituting 
one serving/day of fish for one serving/day of total red meat was associated with lower risk 
of all-cause mortality (HR=0.63, 95% CI=0.47, 0.84). Substituting one serving/day of 
poultry for one serving/day of total red meat was not significantly associated with risk of all-
cause mortality (data not shown).
Total red meat intake was not associated with CVD, CHD, or stroke mortality risk. After 
additional adjustment for low-fat dairy food consumption, higher red meat consumption was 
somewhat associated with increased CHD mortality (HR [highest versus lowest] = 1.29, 
95% CI=1.00, 1.66, ptrend=0.14), but not CVD mortality (HR=1.12, 95% CI=0.94, 1.34, 
ptrend=0.08) or stroke mortality risk (HR=1.05, 95% CI=0.78, 1.42, ptrend=0.25). No 
significant association was observed between poultry, fish, egg, or legume intake and CVD, 
CHD, or stroke mortality risk (Table 3).

 Higher intake of total red meat and poultry was not associated with total cancer, 
gastrointestinal, or other cancer mortality (Table 4). In multivariate analysis, high fish 
consumption was associated with reduced total cancer mortality risk (HR [highest versus 
lowest] =0.79, 95% CI=0.64, 0.98, ptrend=0.03). This association was unchanged with 
adjustment for total red meat (HR=0.79, 95% CI=0.64, 0.98, ptrend=0.03); fruit and 
vegetable (HR=0.81, 95% CI=0.66, 1.01, ptrend=0.07); or low-fat dairy food intake 
(HR=0.79, 95% CI=0.64, 0.99, ptrend=0.03). Fish intake was also associated with lower 
gastrointestinal cancer mortality risk (HR [highest versus lowest]=0.75, 95% CI=0.56, 1.00, 
ptrend=0.02). Intake of eggs was somewhat associated with a reduced risk of total cancer 
mortality (HR=0.81, 95% CI=0.67, 0.99, ptrend=0.17). The highest versus the lowest quintile 
of legume intake was associated with 28% lower risk of total cancer mortality (HR=0.72, 
95% CI=0.58, 0.89, ptrend=0.004), 24% lower risk of gastrointestinal cancer mortality 
(HR=0.76, 95% CI=0.58, 1.01, ptrend=0.05), and 34% lower risk of other cancer mortality 
(HR=0.66, 95% CI=0.47, 0.93, ptrend=0.04). Similar estimates for total cancer mortality 
were noted after additional adjustment for fruit and vegetable intake (data not shown).
Sensitivity Analysis
In sensitivity analyses, participants who died as a result of external events (i.e., accidents, 
intoxication, suicide, or other types of injury; n=217) were excluded. The results were 
similar to total mortality (data not shown). Further, the authors evaluated whether the 
association between protein-rich food intake and all-cause mortality risk was modified by 
gender, age, BMI, smoking, and wealth score. The associations between dietary protein 
sources and all-cause mortality did not differ by gender (Appendix Figure 2, available 
online), age, or BMI (data not shown). A significant interaction between red meat intake and 
smoking status was noted (pinteraction=0.04). Red meat consumption was significantly 
associated with higher all-cause mortality risk in current smokers (HR [highest versus 
lowest] =1.43, 95% CI=1.11, 1.82, ptrend=0.006) compared with never smokers (HR [highest 
versus lowest]=0.93, 95% CI=0.80, 1.07,ptrend=0.64) or former smokers (HR [highest versus 
lowest]=1.06, 95% CI=0.63, 1.78, ptrend=0.87). An inverse association between fish intake 
and all-cause mortality was also observed among non-smokers (pinteraction=0.05; Appendix 
Figure 3, available online). Furthermore, the association between red meat intake and all-
cause mortality was modified by the wealth score. Comparing the highest versus the lowest 
consumption of total red meat, all-cause mortality risk was 34% higher among participants 
who had a higher wealth score (HR=1.34, 95% CI=1.09, 1.65, ptrend=0.02), with no 
association among participants with a lower wealth score (HR=0.93, 95% CI=0.80, 1.08, 
ptrend=0.67; pinteraction=0.02; Appendix Figure 4, available online). No other significant 
interaction was observed.
DISCUSSION
In this prospective community-based cohort study in Iran, high consumption of fish and 
legumes was associated with lower cancer mortality risk, independent of other dietary 
factors. Lowered all-cause mortality risk was observed among participants with high egg 
consumption. Furthermore, high red meat intake was associated with higher mortality risk 
among current smokers as well as participants with higher SES. Poultry, fish, and legume

 consumption was not related to reduced CVD or all-cause mortality risk among all 
participants. However, replacement of red meat with fish, eggs, or legumes was associated 
with lower risk of all-cause mortality.
Based on data from American and European cohort studies, high red meat consumption, 
with more emphasis on processed meat, has been reported to be associated with all-cause 
and specific-cause mortality.17,31–33 However, similar to the results from a pooled analysis 
of eight Asian prospective cohort studies,12 the current study showed that high total red meat 
intake was not associated with all-cause, CVD, or cancer mortality risk. Wide variation in 
the amount of red meat and processed meat intake among studies may lead to a difference in 
risk. Although two servings/day of total red meat is common in most Western countries, 
mean consumption of total red meat was only 0.19 serving/day in the current study, with a 
very small amount of processed red meat (mean intake, 0.04 serving/day). A small amount 
of red meat intake has been reported in Asian prospective cohort studies as well.12 However, 
within smoking subgroups, similar to the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer 
and Nutrition study,31 increased mortality risk was observed among current smokers with 
high total red meat consumption in the current study. Current smokers might be more 
susceptible to adverse health effects of red meat than never or former smokers. Smoking 
may accelerate the carcinogenic effect of red meat owing to its induction of CYP1A2 
activity,34 however, residual confounding from smoking could not be ruled out.
Although high fish consumption has been associated with reduced all-cause mortality9 and 
CHD mortality risk10 in meta-analyses of prospective studies, significant associations were 
not observed in the multivariate-adjusted model. Differences in fish intake may partly 
explain disparities in results, and SES may play an important role in mediating the 
association between fish intake and mortality. In the current study, high fish consumption 
was associated with lower cancer mortality risk, even after adjusting for the wealth score. 
Prospective studies show a very wide range of results.11–13 While high fish consumption 
was not associated with cancer mortality risk in the European Prospective Investigation into 
Cancer and Nutrition study,11 high fish consumption was associated with increased cancer 
mortality risk among men in a pooled analysis of eight Asian cohorts12 and decreased cancer 
mortality risk in British men and women.13 Fish contributing to high intake of n-3 fatty acids 
may suppress the carcinogenesis process and inhibit tumor growth.35
The relation between bean and soybean consumption and cancer risk has been reported in 
some cohort studies.36–39 As an important dietary source of fiber, flavonols, and other 
bioactive constituents, legumes may regulate cell proliferation40 and contribute to the 
prevention of cancer.41
Eggs are a diverse food consisting of several factors that may potentially influence risk of 
chronic diseases. Cholesterol that is found in eggs has been hypothesized to increase risk of 
CHD,42 whereas other nutrients such as vitamins, minerals, carotenoids, and 
monounsaturated fatty acids in eggs may have beneficial health effects.43–45 In general, 
there is no consistent association across epidemiologic studies in terms of CVD or overall 
mortality and egg consumption. Although egg consumption was not associated with CVD 
and all-cause mortality risk in a recent meta-analysis,16 in the current study, high egg

 consumption was associated with reduced mortality risk. The inconsistencies among cohort 
studies might be due to chance or differences in intake. In the Physicians’ Health Study, 
consuming at least one egg/day was significantly associated with higher all-cause mortality 
risk,46 whereas the median egg intake in the highest quartile in the current study population 
was less than half an egg/day.
Limitations
The results need to be interpreted in the context of several limitations. Residual confounding 
is always of concern in any observational study, as participants with high consumption of red 
meat or other dietary protein sources may have different lifestyles and SES compared with 
other participants. Although controlling for potential confounders (except the wealth score) 
had minimal effects on associations, the possibility of residual confounding by unmeasured 
or unknown confounders could not be ruled out. Moreover, random measurement error due 
to within-person variation is possible from use of food frequency questionnaires to assess 
dietary intake. Further, in the current study, the dietary protein sources were only evaluated 
at enrollment and it is likely that participants might have altered dietary habits during the 
follow-up period.
This study has several strengths. The prospective population-based cohort study with a high 
rate of follow up (> 99%) reduced the potential risk of selection bias. To minimize the 
possibility of recall bias, participants with pre-existing diabetes, CVD, or cancer at time of 
enrollment were excluded from the analyses. Furthermore, to the best of the authors’ 
knowledge, this is the first cohort study in the Middle East that prospectively evaluated the 
role of dietary protein sources in mortality risk among a population with different 
socioeconomic and lifestyle patterns.
CONCLUSIONS
The present findings suggest that a high intake of fish and legumes might be associated with 
decreased cancer mortality risk. In addition, lower mortality risk with egg consumption was 
observed. Although there was no significant association between total red meat intake and 
all-cause mortality, the association differed by smoking and SES with increased risk in 
current smokers and in individuals with higher wealth score. Further studies are needed to 
investigate underlying mechanisms.

aAge-adjusted model was adjusted for age (years).
bMultivariate-adjusted model was adjusted for gender; age (years); ethnicity (Turkmen, Persian, others); education (illiterate, ≤5 years, 6–8 years, high school, academic); marital status (married, other); 
residency (rural, urban); smoking (never, former, current <20 p/year, current 20–30 p/year, current ≥30 p/year); opium use (user, non-user); alcohol (user, non-user); BMI (<18.5,18.5 to <20.0, 20.0 to <22.5, 
22.5 to <25.0, 25.0 to <30.0, 30 to <35.0, ≥35.0); systolic blood pressure (quintile); occupational physical activity (sedentary, standing or occasional walking, causing mild increase in heart rate and 
sweating, causing significant increase in heart rate and sweating); family history of cancer (yes, no); wealth score (quintile); medication (using a fixed-dose combination pill consisting of aspirin, valsartan, 
atorvastatin, and hydrochlorothiazide; yes/no); and energy intake (quintile).
