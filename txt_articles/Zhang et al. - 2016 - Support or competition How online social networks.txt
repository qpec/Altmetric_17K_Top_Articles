To identify what features of online social networks can increase physical activity, we conducted a 4-arm random-
ized controlled trial in 2014 in Philadelphia, PA. Students (n = 790, mean age = 25.2) at an university were ran-
domly assigned to one of four conditions composed of either supportive or competitive relationships and either
with individual or team incentives for attending exercise classes. The social comparison condition placed partic-
ipants into 6-person competitive networks with individual incentives. The social support condition placed partic-
ipants into 6-person teams with team incentives. The combined condition with both supportive and competitive
relationships placed participants into 6-person teams, where participants could compare their team's perfor-
mance to 5 other teams' performances. The control condition only allowed participants to attend classes with in-
dividual incentives. Rewards were based on the total number of classes attended by an individual, or the average
number of classes attended by the members of a team. The outcome was the number of classes that participants
attended. Data were analyzed using multilevel models in 2014. The mean attendance numbers per week were
35.7, 38.5, 20.3, and 16.8 in the social comparison, the combined, the control, and the social support conditions.
Attendance numbers were 90% higher in the social comparison and the combined conditions (mean = 1.9, SE =
0.2) in contrast to the two conditions without comparison (mean = 1.0, SE = 0.2) (p = 0.003). Social comparison
was more effective for increasing physical activity than social support and its effects did not depend on individual
or team incentives.

1. Introduction
Physical inactivity significantly increases the risk of chronic disease
(Lee et al., 2001; Sattelmair et al., 2011) and mortality (Nocon et al.,
2008; Wen et al., 2011). Low levels of physical activity among young
adults remains a serious nationwide problem, with 69% of Americans
18 to 24 years of age failing to meet the federal guidelines for physical
activity in 2014 (National Center for Health Statistics, 2015). Among
all the social and environmental factors affecting physical activity
(Addy et al., 2004; Martin and Savla, 2011), interpersonal social
networks are one of the most prominent targets for cost-effective inter-
ventions (Maher et al., 2015). Online social networks, in particular, have
become a highly attractive target for large scale health initiatives
(Centola, 2013; Cobb and Graham, 2012); however, there is insufficient
knowledge about why online networks might be effective sources of
social influence for improving physical activity levels. One prominent
argument in the literature on networks and health suggests that online
relationships improve physical activity through supportive interactions
that encourage healthy behaviors (Centola, 2010, 2011). An alternative
approach stresses peer competition within online networks, emphasiz-
ing the value of social comparison as a mechanism for increasing indi-
viduals' receptiveness to positive behavioral influences (Foster et al.,
2010). We evaluate the effects of each of these approaches indepen-
dently, and in combination, to determine how social motivations for be-
havior change directly impact people's exercise activity.
Social support is one of the most widely used and studied strategies
for encouraging behavior change in social networks (Berkman et al.,
2000). When people with similar interests interact to achieve a shared
goal, social support can reduce the perceived costs of adopting a new
exercise routine by providing companionship in the activity (Cavallo
et al., 2014; Uchino, 2004). Further, social support reduces the uncer-
tainty of exploring new exercises by providing access to relevant
sources of peer information (Wing and Jeffery, 1999). Thus, cooperative
online relationships, where people work towards the same health goals,
can foster collective efficacy for improving everyone's levels of physical
activity (Cohen et al., 2006).
While social support via cooperative relationships may promote
physical activity, an alternative approach utilizes social comparison via

 competitive social relations (Foster et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2015). So-
cial comparison strategies are implicit in fitness and exercise programs
that use rankings, leader boards, and social status markers to increase
physical activity (Festinger, 1954). In these competitive environments,
people work towards their goals individually, and differences in goal at-
tainment motivate individuals to adjust their aspirations upward. The
dynamic process of comparing oneself to others increases everyone's
expectation for goal attainment and eventually improves overall levels
of physical activity (Leahey et al., 2012; Shakya et al., 2015).
The number of online social network health interventions has in-
creased dramatically in recent years (Laranjo et al., 2015; Maher et al.,
2014; Williams et al., 2014). However, the independent causal effects
as well as the interaction effects of these two contrasting approaches
have not been identified (Cavallo et al., 2012; Napolitano et al., 2013;
Neiger et al., 2012). As a result, there is very little guidance as to how
these approaches might be used in applied settings to maximize social
resources for increased fitness. This is particularly striking in light of
recent meta-analyses of online social network health interventions,
which have been inconclusive both on identifying which approaches
are most effective, and regarding whether there are any systematic net-
work strategies that can reliably be used to promote physical activity
(Maher et al., 2014).
These problems of identification are compounded by the fact that
the vast majority of research on online social networks and behavior
change supplements social motivations with non-social incentives,
such as health education and behavior tracking (Korda and Itani,
2013; Williams et al., 2014). This introduces interaction effects that pre-
vent the identification of how, or whether, social factors can directly
motivate behavior change. These shortcomings raise serious theoretical
difficulties for developing consistent and replicable theories of how on-
line social networks impact physical activity. They also limit the ability
to apply online social network interventions to specific behavioral set-
tings, where clear guidelines are required in order to implement effec-
tive interventions. We addressed these problems by conducting a
double-blind four-arm randomized controlled study that compared
the effects of social support and social comparison on increasing physi-
cal activity.
2. Methods
2.1. Study design
An 11-week online social network-based exercise program called
SHAPE-UP was conducted at a Northeastern university. The program
offered 90 exercise classes. On average, eight classes were offered
per week on the University's campus, and each class lasted for an
hour. Class content covered both aerobic and muscle-strengthening
physical activities, including running, spinning, yoga, Pilates, weight
lifting, high intensity interval training, and group exercising. All clas-
ses were led by instructors from the Department of Recreation and
Health Services (DRHS) at the University. Participation in all classes
was restricted to the program participants. At the conclusion of the
program, participants were rewarded with gift cards for their partic-
ipation based on the cumulative number of exercise classes they
attended.
All participants in the program received access to the SHAPE-UP
website, which was the only way for participants to enroll in classes
and to interact with the program. Each participant created an online
profile including username, gender, age, and their University affiliation.
All participants had continuous and equal access to the website. To
register for an exercise class, participants selected available classes
from an interactive calendar that provided a brief class description
and a registration tool. Upon registering, participants immediately re-
ceived a confirmation email, and a reminder email was sent 12 h before
each class started. An online tracking tool provided all participants with
a daily journal of their exercise classes.
Upon logging into the website for the first time, participants were
randomly assigned to one of four experimental conditions. Fig. 1 illus-
trates the four experimental conditions and Table 1 summarizes the
different intervention components of the four conditions. Participants
in the control condition were given the basic website for registering
for classes. The control participants were provided with no social moti-
vations, and were rewarded at the end of the program based on their
individual record of attendance at exercise classes. The top 10% of par-
ticipants in the condition were rewarded $20 gift cards at the end of
the program. Three different experimental manipulations supple-
mented the control condition by providing online peer networks with
different social incentives that might increase participation.
The social comparison condition supplemented the basic class regis-
tration website by giving participants access to 6-person peer networks.
Each participant in this condition was randomly assigned 5 peers, which
comprised 5 members of the study who were connected to the partici-
pant in a program-generated social network. Participants in this condi-
tion were able to compare their performance in the program with their
peers via a competitive ranking based on their peers' activity levels. As
in the control condition, at the conclusion of the program, the rewards
for participants were based on each participant's individual record of
class attendance. The top 10% of participants in the condition were
rewarded $20 gift cards at the end of the program. All peers' information
was anonymous, and there was almost no possibility for direct commu-
nication between participants in this condition online or offline.
By contrast, the social support condition was designed to provide
participants with direct peer support from other members of the pro-
gram who could encourage each other to improve their levels of regular
exercise. Participants in this condition were randomly assigned to 6-
person teams. At the completion of the program, rewards were based
on the team's collective activity levels, incentivizing team members to
actively support each other's attendance at exercise classes. All mem-
bers in the top 10% of teams in the condition were rewarded $20 gift
cards at the end of the program. To facilitate supportive social interac-
tion, participants in the social support condition were provided with a
chatting tool that they could use to directly communicate with each
other in real-time. Team members could see both each other's individ-
ual records of class attendance as well as the collective record of the
team. Participants in this condition were able to register for classes individ-
ually, but they could also coordinate to register for classes collectively.
Finally, to understand if there was an interaction effect of combining
the motivations of social support and social comparison, the combined
condition randomly placed individuals on 6-person teams and provided
the same team incentives and technologies as the social support condi-
tion; however this condition was supplemented with a competitive fea-
ture, in the form of an interface that allowed participants to compare
their team's performance against the performances of 5 other teams.
All members in the top 5% of teams in the condition were rewarded
$20 gift cards at the end of the program.
In these three conditions with online networks, participants in the
same network also received real-time web and email notifications
about their peers' registration and attendance of classes. For instance,
when a network member attended a class, all of her peers would receive
a notification about her class attendance. This signaling system was
identical for all online networks across conditions.
2.2. Study participants
The SHAPE-UP program was open to all graduate and professional
students at the University who were 18 years or older. Participants
were recruited through advertisements on the University's website,
through the student email list, via advertisements from the graduate stu-
dent association, and with paper flyers placed on billboards around cam-
pus. The recruitment materials specified that the purpose of the project
was to improve participants' quality of life through better fitness. Eligibil-
ity for enrollment in the study was determined by a physical assessment
454
J. Zhang et al. / Preventive Medicine Reports 4 (2016) 453–458
 conducted by the DRHS. Each participant completed a screening
questionnaire (Canadian Society for Exercise Physiology (CSEP), 2002)
designed to identify adults for whom physical activity might be inappro-
priate. The assessment lasted for 10 min and also measured participants'
physical endurance, strength, and Body Mass Index (BMI).
Participant enrollment and assessments were conducted from
August through September 2014. Eligible participants completed a
baseline online survey assessing demographic and organizational infor-
mation including gender, age, race, University department, and gym
membership. In addition, we assessed participants' baseline physical ac-
tivity with 3 items the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(2001) developed concerning the number of days in which people par-
ticipate in vigorous physical activity for at least 20 min, moderate activ-
ity for at least 30 min, and strength-building activities in the past 7 days.
Participants were defined as meeting the 2008 federal physical activity
guideline (Department of Health and Human Services, 2008) if they
engaged in strength-building activity on at least 2 days and engaged
in either 20 min of vigorous activity on at least 4 days or 30 min of mod-
erate activity on at least 5 days.
In the RCT design, computer-generated random number sequences
were used to randomly assign participants to the 4 experimental condi-
tions after the baseline assessments. The random assignments were
generated using the statistical software R, version 3.1.2.
Classes were held from September 2014 through December 2014.
Participants and class instructors were blind to experimental assign-
ments. Data collection was completed by December 2014. The study
was approved by the institutional review board of the University, and
all participants provided informed consent.
2.3. Outcome
The outcome of interest was the total number of exercise classes that
participants attended throughout the 11-week program. Complete
attendance data for all classes were provided by class instructors. In-
structors collected individual attendance data with student emails and
entered them into an online database. The attendance records then
automatically showed up on participants' websites in real time. Atten-
dance data were collected on site of each exercise class.
2.4. Statistical analysis
A sample size of 688 was planned because 172 participants per
condition could achieve at least 90% power to detect a small to medium
effect size of 0.35 (Cavallo et al., 2012; Foster et al., 2010; Zhang et al.,
2015) in class attendance difference at the 5% significance level. The
preliminary analysis consisted of an analysis of variance to examine
the effects of social support and social comparison on the outcome,
class attendance. However, it did not account for data clustering in the
online networks. In each of the conditions with online networks,
individuals received the treatment as members of a fully-connected
network of 6 individuals, thus the primary analyses employed a multi-
level regression model to account for the clustering of the treatment
within these groups. The multilevel model included the social support
and the social comparison factors, the support × comparison interac-
tion, and covariates of baseline demographics. All analyses used the
intention-to-treat principle and considered all participants who were
randomly assigned to a condition, regardless of whether or not they re-
ceived the treatment. All analyses were conducted in R, version 3.1.2.
3. Results
Of the 1007 participants who registered for the program, 790
attended the fitness evaluation and were randomly assigned to a condi-
tion. Fig. 2 shows the flow of participants. A total of 750 participants re-
ceived at least one treatment exposure, as indicated by logging-in to the
website. The attrition rates for participants receiving the treatment

 were statistically indistinguishable across all conditions, with 95% of all
participants receiving the treatment.
Table 2 shows participants' characteristics. Participants ranged in
age from 20 to 59 years (mean = 25.2, SD = 3.4), and ranged in BMI
from 16.1 to 45.0 (mean = 23.0, SD = 3.8). In total, 454 (57.47%) partic-
ipants did not meet the physical activity guideline. There were no signif-
icant differences in participants' characteristics at baseline across
conditions.
Participants showed high levels of engagement with the website,
averaging 22.8 logins (SD = 47.2) across all conditions during the pro-
gram. Participants in the social support condition generated 81 online
messages and participants in the combined condition generated 80
messages. The majority of the messages provided informational support
regarding participants' plans for attending classes, their experiences,
and opinions about the classes.
The number of exercise classes that each participant attended
ranged from 0 to 39 classes. Attendance rates were 90% higher in the
social comparison and the combined conditions (mean = 1.9,
SE = 0.2) in contrast to the two conditions without social comparison
(mean = 1.0, SE = 0.2). Both the social comparison and the combined
conditions had significantly higher mean attendance rates (mean = 1.9,
SE = 0.3 and mean = 1.9 SE = 0.2, respectively) than the control
(mean = 1.1, SE = 0.3), while social support surprisingly performed
worse (mean = 0.9, SE = 0.2). An analysis of variance shows that the
presence of social comparison significantly increased activity levels
(F = 8.96, p = 0.003, Cohen's D = 0.21). In contrast, the presence of
social support did not significantly affect participants' exercise levels
(F = 0.04, p = 0.85, Cohen's D = 0.01). There was no interaction be-
tween the two factors (F = 0.18, p = 0.67).
Table 3 presents results of the multilevel models that accounted for
network-level influences within each condition. On average, social com-
parison increased attendance by 82% [95% CI: −5%, 168%], or 0.97 clas-
ses per participant (p = 0.07). After adjusting for baseline covariates,
social comparison increased attendances by 62% [95% CI: 5% to 119%],
or 1.06 classes per participant (p = 0.03). In contrast, social support
had no significant effect (p = 0.68). Additionally, the non-significant in-
teraction between support and comparison suggests that social support
did not contribute to the increased attendance rates in the combined
condition. The success of the combined condition can be thus attributed
to the effects of team-based social comparison.
The mean class attendances per week were 35.7, 38.5, 20.3, and 16.8
in the social comparison, the combined, the control, and the social

 support conditions. Fig. 3 plots cumulative class attendance in each con-
dition. Both of the conditions with social comparison (i.e., comparison
and combined) showed significantly higher levels of attendance each
day, averaging 5.1 and 5.5 people attending exercise classes per day,
respectively. Both were significantly higher than the average of 2.9 at-
tendances per day (p b 0.001) in the control condition. Class attendance
in the support condition grew at a significantly slower rate than in the
control condition, averaging only 2.4 attendances per day (p b 0.001),
suggesting that social support reduced daily exercise rates as compared
to the control condition.
4. Discussion
Despite the proliferation of online social network health inter-
ventions, social influence processes underlying social network
effects have remained poorly understood. In this study, we found
that social comparison in online networks provided a significantly
greater source of social incentives for increasing physical activity than
social support. Exposing individuals to relevant reference points,
whether those reference points were other individuals or other teams,
increased responsiveness to the physical activity of their peers. As a re-
sult, attendance at exercise classes was greatest in conditions where in-
dividuals and teams were motivated to exercise through competitive
social relationships.
Physical activity in the social comparison and control conditions was
incentivized based on individual rewards for exercising, while activity in
the support condition was incentivized based on group rewards. The dif-
ferences between the social comparison and social support conditions
suggest that the observed reduction in activity in the support condition
may be due to the ineffectiveness of collective rewards for motivating ex-
ercise. However, exercise levels were greatest in the combined condition,
which also used collective rewards to incentivize participation. Moreover,
the comparison condition and the combined condition generated nearly
identical levels of exercise activity. This suggests that differences in incen-
tives did not affect participants' exercise levels (Halpern et al., 2015;
Jeffery et al., 1983; Leahey et al., 2012). Both individual and team rewards
were equally effective for motivating activity.
A significant advantage of the four-arm experimental design is the
ability to identify the independent and combined effects of social sup-
port and social comparison. A two-arm experiment that contrasted,
e.g., the social support and social comparison conditions, or the com-
bined condition with the control condition, would have been likely to
produce incorrect inferences. For instance, in a two-arm experimental
test between the combined condition and the control condition, it
would appear as if social support (via team memberships) was effective
at motivating increased participation. The four-way comparison be-
tween the control condition, social support, social comparison and the
combined condition shows the opposite to be true – team memberships
were effective for social comparison, but not for social support. It is only
when the combined condition is compared independently with the so-
cial comparison condition that team memberships are shown not to
produce any additional support-based motivations to exercise.
The strengths of this experimental design also entail limitations on
the scope of the study. Most notably, while online networks typically
evolve through endogenous social selection based on similar interests
or characteristics, we artificially constructed the online networks used
in this study. While this allowed us to ensure that there were no con-
founding effects from exogenous social information, it raises the poten-
tial concern that endogenous tie selection might create networks that
were stronger sources for more effective generation of social support.
In other words, our design might underestimate the effects of social
support networks. Another limitation is that, although we created dif-
ferent social incentives in the experimental conditions, we did not mea-
sure psychological variables after the intervention, including perceived
social support and social comparison. Thus, we were not able to conduct
mediation analyses to test whether the intervention effects were medi-
ated through hypothesized mechanisms. It was possible that the com-
parison incentive also increased participants' perceived descriptive
social norms regarding physical activity as participants might pay
more attention to other peers' efforts under the competitive mindset.
Similarly we were not able to quantify the extent of class registration
coordination among team members. Future research can extend our de-
sign with mediation surveys to identify the hypothesized psychological
variables and with process evaluations to quantify participants' engage-
ment with different components of the program. Finally, findings from
this study sample are based on young adults from one university and
may not be generalizable to other segments of the broader population.
Future research can apply this design to study other population samples
in other social contexts, as well as to study additional outcomes mea-
sures (e.g., body weight and muscle strength) that might be studied
over longer periods of time.

 Our results suggest that networks that emphasize social comparison
among members can be surprisingly effective for motivating desirable
behaviors. The results from the combined condition, where adding
team performances to a supportive environment significantly increased
exercise levels, suggest that the introduction of a minimal competitive
reference point into an otherwise support-based environment can
change ineffective health networks into highly motivating social re-
sources. Healthcare providers, online fitness programs, and peer-to-
peer communities for improving patient health all seek ways to struc-
ture social interactions among their members to provide the greatest
incentives for adopting and maintaining health behaviors. Social com-
parison might be harnessed to address a variety of other health issues
such as medication compliance, diabetes control, smoking cessation,
flu vaccinations, weight loss, and preventative screenings (Centola,
2013). Future research can extend our approach to test whether the
strong effect of social comparison through constructed online networks
can be realized in health promotion domains other than physical
activity.
