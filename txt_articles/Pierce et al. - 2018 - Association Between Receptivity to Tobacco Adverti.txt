IMPORTANCE Cigarette marketing contributes to initiation of cigarette smoking among young
people, which has led to restrictions on use of cigarette advertising. However, little is known
about other tobacco advertising and progression to tobacco use in youth and young adults.
OBJECTIVE To investigate whether receptivity to tobacco advertising among youth and
young adults is associated with progression (being a susceptible never user or ever user) to
use of the product advertised, as well as conventional cigarette smoking.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health
(PATH) Study at wave 1 (2013-2014) and 1-year follow-up at wave 2 (2014-2015) was
conducted in a US population-based sample of never tobacco users aged 12 to 24 years from
wave 1 of the PATH Study (N = 10 989). Household interviews using audio computer-assisted
self-interviews were conducted.
EXPOSURES Advertising for conventional cigarettes, electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes),
cigars, and smokeless tobacco products at wave 1.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Progression to susceptibility or ever tobacco use at 1-year
follow-up in wave 2.
RESULTS Of the 10 989 participants (5410 male [weighted percentage, 48.3%]; 5579 female
[weighted percentage, 51.7%]), receptivity to any tobacco advertising at wave 1 was high for
those aged 12 to 14 years (44.0%; 95% confidence limit [CL], 42.6%-45.4%) but highest for
those aged 18 to 21 years (68.7%; 95% CL, 64.9%-72.2%). e-Cigarette advertising had the
highest receptivity among all age groups. For those aged 12 to 17 years, susceptibility to use a
product at wave 1 was significantly associated with product use at wave 2 for conventional
cigarettes, e-cigarettes, cigars, and smokeless tobacco products. Among committed never
users aged 12 to 17 years at wave 1, any receptivity was associated with progression toward
use of the product at wave 2 (conventional cigarettes: adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1.43; 95%
CL, 1.23-1.65; e-cigarettes: AOR, 1.62; 95% CL, 1.41-1.85; cigars: AOR, 2.01; 95% CL, 1.62-2.49;
and smokeless (males only): AOR, 1.42; 95% CL, 1.07-1.89) and with use of the product
(conventional cigarettes: AOR, 1.54; 95% CL, 1.03-2.32; e-cigarettes: AOR, 1.45; 95% CL,
1.19-1.75; cigars: AOR, 2.07; 95% CL, 1.26-3.40). Compared with those not receptive to any
product advertising, receptivity to e-cigarette advertising, but not to cigarette advertising,
was independently associated with those aged 12 to 21 years having used a cigarette at wave
2 (AOR, 1.60; 95% CL, 1.08-2.38).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Receptivity to tobacco advertising was significantly
associated with progression toward use in adolescents. Receptivity was highest for
e-cigarette advertising and was associated with trying a cigarette.

 T
he US Surgeon General1 has concluded that cigarette ad-
vertisingpromotestheinitiationofcigarettesmoking.In
the United States, 82% of adult smokers try their first
cigarette before age 18 years and 93% before age 21 years,1(p238)
which is the minimum age to purchase tobacco in 2 states and
inmorethan215localities.2Within4yearsoffirstsmoking,30%
to 50% of adolescents progress to established use3,4; the asso-
ciateddependencecontinuesformanyyears.3-5Restrictionson
cigarettemarketingintroducedin19986coincidedwiththestart
of a long-term decline in high school seniors ever smoking
(65%-28% in 2016).7 Exposure to marketing of noncigarette
tobacco products (particularly electronic cigarettes
[e-cigarettes]) has grown rapidly,8-10 as has use of these
products.11-15 As e-cigarette advertising models vaping, a
behavior similar to cigarette smoking, it has been hypoth-
esized that e-cigarette advertising could promote conven-
tional cigarette smoking.16,17
The initiation process has been best described for ciga-
rette smoking. In the United States, progression from being a
committedneversmokerbeginswiththedevelopmentofacog-
nitive susceptibility to smoke in late childhood/adolescence18
followed by trial and increased frequency of use.1,4,10 Effec-
tive marketing encourages product use with messages that
elicit a positive (receptive) response from those viewing the
advertisement.19Communicationandadvertisingtheories20,21
propose levels of receptivity with higher levels more predic-
tive of future use. Receptivity to cigarette advertising in-
creases the probability that committed never smokers will be-
come susceptible and then try a cigarette (ie, progress toward
use).10,16,17,22,23 In this article, we report whether this pattern
holds across other tobacco products.

The PATH Study was conducted by Westat, a contract re-
search organization, and approved by its institutional review
board, and the study plan and procedures were approved by
the Office of Management and Budget. Written informed con-
sent was obtained from adult respondents and written assent
was obtained from youth after written informed consent from
a parent. The study provided incentives to thank respon-
dents for participating in the study.25
Wave 1 interviews were conducted from September 12,
2013, to December 14, 2014; the weighted response rate for the
household screener was 54.0%. Among screened house-
holds, the overall weighted response rate at wave 1 was 74.0%
for the adult interview (n = 32 320) and 78.4% for the youth
interview (age 12-17 years, n = 13 651). Wave 2 interviews were
conducted as close as possible to the 1-year anniversary of each
respondent’
s wave 1 interview (weighted response rate: adult
interview, 83.2%; youth interview, 87.3%).26,27

 to include other electronic nicotine products, such as e-cigars,
e-pipes,e-hookahs,personalvaporizers,vapepens,andhookah
pens. We considered all of these as electronic nicotine delivery
systems (ENDS) and e-cigarette variations.
Susceptibility to Use Tobacco Products
To determine susceptibility of future use,17 we identified com-
mitted never users (ie, those considered at minimum risk of
future use) and categorized all others as susceptible. For ciga-
rettes and other tobacco products that a respondent had seen
or heard of, never users aged 12 to 17 years were asked 3 ques-
tionsatwave1:“Haveyoueverbeencuriousaboutusing<prod-
uct>?”; “Do you think you might try using <product> soon?”;
and “If one of your best friends were to offer you <product>,
would you use it?” Four-level responses ranged from not at all
curious to very curious, or from definitely not to definitely yes.
Respondentswiththestrongestnegativeresponsetoall3ques-
tions and respondents who had never heard of the product
were categorized as committed never users. All other respon-
dents were categorized as susceptible to use the product, in-
cluding those with missing responses. Susceptibility was not
queried among participants aged 18 to 24 years at wave 1 but
was among those aged 12 to 24 years at wave 2.
Receptivity to Tobacco Product Advertising
The PATH Study assessed receptivity at wave 1 based on fa-
vorite ads, recall, and liking ads.24 Respondents were asked to
select the brand of their favorite tobacco advertisement from
a list. We allocated favorite brands to 1 of the 4 categories (ciga-
rettes,e-cigarettes,cigars,orsmokelesstobaccoproducts).Un-
less snus was specifically mentioned, we assumed that nomi-
nation of Marlboro or Camel referred to cigarettes.
Eachrespondentwasthenshown20ads(5fromeachstudy
category) randomly sampled from a near-census collection
(n = 959) of print, direct mail, and television ads used in the
periodimmediatelyprecedingthesurvey.24Foreachadshown,
respondents were asked if they had seen the ad in the past 12
months (aided recall) and whether they liked, disliked, or were
neutral to the ad (eFigure in the Supplement). Receptivity to
ads for each product type was categorized as (1) no receptiv-
ity (no recall or liking of any of the 5 ads and no favorite ad),
(2) low receptivity (recall of at least 1 shown ad but no liking
of any ad and no favorite), or (3) moderate/high receptivity (lik-
ing at least 1 of the ads or naming a favorite ad). Any receptiv-
ity was a combination of categories 2 and 3. Respondents could
be receptive to ads for multiple products. We report data for
combinations of ads for conventional cigarettes, e-cigarettes,
and other products (eg, smokeless and cigars).
Other Variables
Assessments of age, sex, and race/ethnicity are provided in the
PATHStudyDataUserGuide.26,27 Missingself-reportdatawere
replaced by data from the household screener sex (n = 26), age
(n = 2),race(n = 473),andethnicity(n = 187).Asthesevariables

”Wereportedbinaryvariablesofexposureforhouse-
hold and social exposure (0 vs ≥1 hour).
Statistical Analysis
We computed variances using the recommended balanced re-
peated replication method with Fay adjustment = 0.3.28
Weighted percentages and modified Wilson confidence lim-
its (CLs) for proportions were also calculated.29 For each prod-
uct assessed, a logistic regression among wave 1 never users
oftheproductaged12to17yearstestedtheassociationofwave
1 susceptibility with wave 2 use of the product. For each of the
4 products with receptivity data, among committed never
users aged 12 to 17 years, logistic regression models tested
whether wave 1 receptivity (compared with no receptivity) was
associated with either ever use or progression (combined sus-
ceptibility and ever use) at wave 2. As males are much more
likely to use smokeless products than females,30,31 we re-
peated the smokeless models for males only. Finally, for never
tobacco smokers aged 12 to 21 years, a logistic regression tested
whether wave 1 receptivity to e-cigarette advertising was as-
sociated with ever using a cigarette at wave 2. Logistic regres-
sions included wave 1 covariates for sociodemographics and
both household and social exposure to tobacco use. Odds ra-
tios, 95% CLs, and P values were reported from the weighted,
adjusted model. All analyses were conducted using SAS
SURVEY procedures, version 9.4 (SAS Institute).
Results
Receptivity to Advertising for Different Tobacco Products
by Age at Wave 1
The proportion of individuals with any level of receptivity to
any tobacco ad increased significantly across successive age
groups up to 21 years (nonoverlapping 95% CLs), from 44.0%
for those aged 12 to 14 years to 68.7% for those aged 18 to 21
years, with receptivity among the 22- to 24-year group closer
to that of the 15- to 17-year group (Table 1). For all age groups
through 21 years, any receptivity was highest for e-cigarette
ads, followed by cigarette, smokeless tobacco, and cigar ads.
This pattern of a progressively greater proportion that was re-
ceptive to any product advertisement up to age 21 years was
most marked for moderate/high receptivity: those aged 18 to
21 years were almost 3 times more likely to have moderate/
highreceptivitycomparedwiththoseaged12to14years(27.5%
vs 9.7%). Any vs no receptivity levels for covariates are
presented in the eTable in the Supplement.
Receptivity to Combinations of Tobacco Product Advertising
Among Never Tobacco Users Aged 12 to 24 Years
Of those with receptivity to a tobacco ad, 68.4% had low
receptivity, although most were receptive to advertising
for multiple products (Table 2). Receptivity to the most

 prevalent combinations of tobacco product advertising was
(1) cigarettes alone (23.2%), (2) e-cigarettes alone (33.3%),
(3) both cigarettes and e-cigarettes (33.9%), and (4) any other
combinations (9.7%). Thus, of those who had any level of
receptivity to any product ad, 67.2% were receptive to
e-cigarette ads and 57.1% were receptive to cigarette ads.

Receptivity to e-Cigarette Advertising at Wave 1
and Ever Using a Conventional Cigarette at Wave 2
Among never tobacco users aged 12 to 21 years at wave 1, we
conducted a multivariable logistic regression of those who had
ever used a cigarette at wave 2. Table 4 presents the results for
the main combinations of receptivity to tobacco product ad-
vertising outlined in Table 2. Compared with those who were
not receptive to advertisements for any tobacco product, those
who were receptive only to conventional cigarette advertis-
ing at wave 1 were significantly more likely to have ever used
a conventional cigarette at wave 2, as were those who were re-
ceptive to advertising for both conventional cigarettes and
e-cigarettes. Those who were receptive to e-cigarette adver-
tising, but not receptive to conventional cigarette advertis-
ing,werealsomorelikelytohaveeverusedaconventionalciga-
rette at wave 2 compared with those with no receptivity.
Discussion
Susceptibility to conventional cigarettes, e-cigarettes, cigars,
and smokeless tobacco at wave 1 was associated with ever use
of that product by wave 2 and is thus an early measure of pro-
gression toward product use. Between wave 1 and 2 of the na-
tionally representative PATH Study, there was considerable
progression toward use of tobacco products among the aged
12- to 21-years group. Receptivity to advertising for each of the
4 tested products was associated with progression toward
use of the advertised product. In 2013 to 2014, 44% of never
tobacco users aged 12 to 14 years were receptive to advertis-
ing for at least 1 tobacco product. Among committed never
e-cigaretteusersaged12to17yearsatwave1,36%ofthosewho
were receptive to e-cigarette advertising progressed toward
e-cigaretteuseatwave2comparedwith25%ofthosewhowere
not receptive. Similarly, any receptivity was associated with
progression toward use in the age 12- to 17-year group of con-
ventional cigarettes (25.5% vs 19%), cigars (31.7% vs 17.8%),
and smokeless tobacco for males (14.1% vs 10.4%). Receptiv-
ity was also associated with first use within the year for each
product, except smokeless tobacco (which may be a small
sample size issue). The crossover effect is important: recep-
tivity to e-cigarette advertising without concurrent receptiv-
ity to cigarette advertising was associated with never tobacco
users trying a conventional cigarette by wave 2.
Althoughthemajority(66.2%)ofENDSusersatwave2had
used an e-cigarette, almost half reported use of e-hookah, sug-
gesting that ENDS products might be perceived to be versions
of the same product category. Accordingly, this study consid-
ers any ENDS use as e-cigarette use. We repeated our analy-
ses using only those who progressed to e-cigarettes and, as this
did not change our findings, kept the inclusive definition of
e-cigarettes as any ENDS product at wave 2. Multiple longitu-
dinal studies have shown a positive association between
e-cigarette use by youth and later conventional cigarette
smoking.32-36 These findings suggest a hypothesis that initial
exposure to nicotine can lead individuals to look for a more
efficient product that provides satisfaction. Our study of never
tobacco users suggests a role for an environmental influence
in that the effectiveness of e-cigarette advertising contrib-
utes to the association between e-cigarette use and conven-
tional cigarette smoking.

 First use of a tobacco product typically starts before age
21 years1 and a number of jurisdictions have recently pro-
scribed purchase of tobacco products before that age. The
PATH Study measured receptivity to tobacco advertising
among youth aged 12 to 24 years and we report that, across
products, receptivity peaks by age 21 years. The approach to
measuring receptivity was the most comprehensive of
any study to date, with each respondent viewing 20 ads
sampled for each respondent from a near-census of ads
used in the previous year.
Strengths and Limitations
A limitation is that the PATH Study did not specifically include
either online or social media marketing ad images; however, as
tobacco ads are typically used on multiple media channels, our
measure of receptivity likely included exposure to ads appear-
ing on social media. More research is needed on this topic. A
strength of the PATH Study is that data were collected from a
nationally representative, household-based sample and that
participants completed multiple surveys over time. At wave 2,
the study retained over 83% of wave 1 participants. Suscepti-
bility to use a product was not measured for those aged 18 to
24 years in wave 1, but relevant hypotheses may be addressed
in future articles using waves 2 and 3 data. Furthermore, the
wave 1 ever use rate for those aged 12 to 17 years was lower than
for some other national surveys, which may be a survey mode
effect.37 Later waves did not include the ad receptivity mea-
sure, so we were unable to consider the effect of consistency
in receptivity reporting across time.
Conclusions
Receptivity to tobacco product advertising is substantial
among US youth who are below the minimum required age
to purchase tobacco products. Among young committed
never users, receptivity is significantly associated with pro-
gression toward use within a 1-year period. With 1 excep-
tion, likely related to study power, having any level of
receptivity to a product’
s advertisements at wave 1 was
associated with both progression toward use and ever use of
the product at wave 2. Further research can examine why
e-cigarette advertising was associated with trying a ciga-
rette. Our study reinforces that tobacco product marketing
continues to be an important contributor to tobacco use
among young people.
