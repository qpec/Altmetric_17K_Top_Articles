Abstract
Introduction—Vascular targeted photodynamic therapy (VTP) with WST11 (TOOKAD® 
Soluble; STEBA Biotech, Luxembourg) is a form of tissue ablation that may be used 
therapeutically for localized prostate cancer (PCa). To study dosing parameters and associated 
treatment effects we undertook a prospective multicenter phase I/II trial of WST11 VTP for 
treatment of PCa
Methods—30 men with unilateral, low volume, Gleason 3+3 PCa were enrolled at 5 centers 
following local IRB approval. Light energy, fiber number, and WST11 dose were escalated to 
identify optimal dosing parameters for VTP hemiablation. Men were treated by VTP and

 evaluated by post-treatment MRI and biopsy. PSA, light dose index (LDI-defined as sum of fiber 
length/ desired treatment volume), toxicity, and quality of life parameters were recorded.
Results—Following dose escalation, 21 men received optimized dosing of 4 mg/kg WST11 200 
J energy. On post-treatment biopsy, residual PCa was found in the treated lobe in 10 men, 
untreated lobe in 4, and both lobes in 1. When LDI ≥ 1, at optimal dosing, (n=15), 73.3% had a 
negative biopsy in the treated lobe. Six men undergoing retreatment, with optimal dose and LDI ≥ 
1, had negative post-treatment biopsy. Minimal effects on urinary, sexual function, and overall 
quality of life, were observed.
Conclusions—Hemiablation of the prostate with WST11 VTP was well-tolerated and resulted 
in negative biopsy in the treated lobe for the majority of men. Dosing parameters and LDI appear 
related to tissue response as determined by MRI and biopsy. These parameters may serve as the 
basis for further prospective studies.

Introduction
In recent years, there has been a growing interest in tissue ablative strategies for focal 
therapy for localized prostate cancer (PCa)1–3. While early results of limited clinical trials 
have been promising, several obstacles remain before widespread adoption4. In addition to a 
lack of long-term oncologic outcomes, short-term challenges in trial design persist, 
including candidate selection, method of treatment guidance, optimal energy source, and 
appropriate endpoints for follow-up5,1,3.Several energy sources have been tested in the 
prostate, demonstrating variable outcomes in local tissue destruction and tolerability6–8, but 
there is limited data on the utilization of treatment planning and image correlation for 
evaluation of tissue necrosis9–12.
One well-studied and proven form of soft tissue ablation is photodynamic therapy (PDT), 
which refers to tissue destruction created by the interaction of a specific wavelength of light 
with a photosensitive agent9,13,14 Several advantages of PDT have been recognized, 
including lack of reliance on thermal energy dispersion or heat-sink effect15. WST11 
(TOOKAD® Soluble; STEBA Biotech, Luxembourg) is a recently described photodynamic 
agent that is retained in the vascular compartment, and mediates ablation through localized 
generation of oxygen free-radicals, resulting in vascular thrombosis and local cellular 
apoptosis16–19 We undertook a prospective phase I/II multicenter trial of WST11 mediated 
vascular-targeted PDT (VTP) for the focal ablation of PCa.
Methods
Study Design
This was a multi-center phase I/II, non-randomised, open-label, trial conducted within 5 
centers in the United States (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT0094681). Following 
approval by local institutional review boards, 30 men with serum PSA ≤ 10 ng/ml, clinical

 stage T1c/T2a, unilateral PCa demonstrated on a minimum 12 core transrectal prostate 
biopsy (PBx), who had been offered but refused traditional therapy, were enrolled. Men 
were excluded if biopsy Gleason score > 3+3, > 50% of sampled cores positive, bilateral 
disease, any core with cancer length > 5 mm, current PCa treatment, hormonal deprivation 
(excluding 5-alpha reductase inhibitors) or supplementation within 6 months, or previous 
TURP.
The primary objective of the study was to define the optimal drug and light dosage necessary 
to achieve negative biopsy in the treated lobe, through sequential escalation of drug dose, 
light fiber number, and energy, and to determine the safety and tolerability of WST11-
mediated VTP. Secondary outcomes included quality of life, drug pharmacokinetics, and 
pharmacodynamics.
Treatment Planning
Included men underwent multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI), centrally 
reviewed by an external committee, to determine necessary tissue volume to be treated to 
achieve hemi-ablation of the cancer-bearing lobe; to plan the number, length and position of 
light fibers to be utilized in treatment; to identify obvious radiographic presence of extra-
capsular disease; but not for cancer diagnosis or localization.
Treatment and Follow-up
Treatment consisted of a unilateral hemi-ablation of the affected lobe. The procedure, 
performed using general anesthesia, has been previously described in detail10,14,15 In brief, 
VTP consisted of a single, 10 minute IV administration of the designated dose of WST11 
followed immediately by a 20 minute light exposure interval. Light activation was delivered 
through transperineal interstitial optical fibers, placed prior to IV WST-11 administration 
under TRUS guidance in accordance with a previously devised mpMRI-based treatment 
plan. Laser light at 753 nm was delivered the designated energy level, using a multichannel 
diode laser (V-Gen Electro Optics Ltd, Israel, model 8CH-753 Mk II).
The pre-defined dose escalation scheme, not segregated by study site, consisted of either 2, 
4, or 6 mg/kg WST11 activated with 200 or 300 J/cm light in a 3 + 3 dose escalation design 
to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). The decision to escalate to subsequent 
drug and/or light dose was determined by an independent data safety monitoring board 
(DSMB) after mpMRI obtained 1 week post-treatment and assessment of treatment-related 
adverse events in each escalation stratile.
Stopping rules for dose escalation were defined in case of dose limiting toxicity (DLT), 
significant adverse events (AEs), i.e. severe or serious drug-related AEs, changes in safety 
laboratory parameters defined as grade ≥ 2 according to National Cancer Institute’s 
Common Terminology Criteria for AEs (CTCAE), unexpected or atypical MRI findings, or 
deterioration in electrocardiogram (ECG) findings. DLT was defined as specific AEs graded 
as CTCAE grade ≥ 3 (hypotension and venous thrombosis) or grade ≥ 2 (photosensitivity 
related to interaction of light and drug, genito-urinary stricture/stenosis, rectal injury, 
infection and urinary retention). If ≥ 2 out of 3 (or ≥ 2 out of 6) patients at a particular drug 
and light dose combination had DLT, escalation was to be stopped and the previous drug and

 light dose was to be declared the MTD. When no further dose escalations were 
recommended by the DSMB, the recommended dose was to be expanded up to a maximum 
of 30 patients.
Men were followed for a total of 12 months with serial PSA, mpMRI, physical exam, quality 
of life assessment, and adverse event recording. Light density index (LDI), defined as the 
ratio between total light-emitting length of inserted laser fibers (cm) and the baseline desired 
volume of necrosis by planimetry (cm3) of targeted prostate, was calculated for each patient.
Volume and confluence of necrosis was assessed by post-treatment gadolinium enhanced 
mpMRI performed at 7 days and 6 months following treatment. Volume of non-perfused 
prostate tissue was calculated by planimetry and compared to intended volume of necrosis.
A follow-up 12-core PBx was obtained 6 months following treatment. Men with residual 
ipsilateral PCa, meeting initial study inclusion criteria, were offered a single repeat VTP 
procedure. The second treatment was conducted ≥ 6 weeks after the 6-month biopsy. 
Following repeat treatment, an additional 12 months of total follow-up was recorded, with 
follow-up biopsy at 6 months post-treatment.
Urinary and erectile function prior to VTP, and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months post-treatment, 
were assessed using the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and International 
Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5) quality of life questionnaires, respectively. Quality of 
life was assessed at the same time points using the Functional Assessment of Cancer 
Therapy - Prostate (FACT-P) Questionnaire.
Statistics
All analyses were descriptive and performed for the overall cohort and individual treatment 
groups (by WST11 dose and light energy dose). Descriptive statistics were calculated for 
quantitative variables; frequency counts by category were given for qualitative variables. 
Efficacy was analyzed by comparison of the relationship between drug dose/light energy 
dose and negative biopsies at Month 6, change from baseline in the proportion of viable 
prostate tissue as assessed by planar measurement of the area of ablation/non-perfused tissue 
using dynamic gadolinium MRI at Week 1 and Month 6, post-treatment changes in levels of 
PSA, and post-treatment changes in the IPSS, IIEF 5, and FACT P scores.
No sample size calculation was performed. The numbers of patients enrolled was based on 
the MTD determined during the study and the expansion of the MTD cohort. The expansion 
cohort was planned for up to 30 patients in total.
Results
A total of 30 men enrolled and treated in the study were included in safety and efficacy 
analysis (Table 1). Two patients discontinued the study before the 12-month follow-up (1 
due to withdrawal of consent and 1 because the patient moved away). During the dose 
escalation phase, 3 patients received single fiber, 2 mg/kg WST11, 200 J/cm light and 6 
patients received 2 mg/kg WST11, 300 J/cm light (single or multifiber). Based upon 
cumulative data from PCM202 and concurrent ongoing European trials20, dose escalation

 was discontinued following the multifiber - 2mg/kg WST11 - 300 J/cm dose group by the 
DSMB and the trial sponsor, as it was felt that reproducible, confluent necrosis could be 
achieved at an optimal dosing of multiple laser fibers, 4 mg/kg WST11, and 200 J/cm 
energy, and that further escalation would risk toxicity without perceived benefit in efficacy. 
A total of 21 patients were thus treated at the optimal dose.
Evaluation of 1-week post-treatment DCE-MRI studies revealed median non-perfused 
prostate tissue was 52.3% (± 31.9) of the intended tissue ablation (Table 2), and just over 
half of the patients (56.7%) had extra-prostatic treatment extension observed. Among 21 
men receiving the optimal dosing parameters, the mean ablation effect was 64.1% (± 25.3) 
of intended. Among 17 men with LDI ≥ 1, mean ablation was 73.9% (± 14.7) of intended 
volume. For men treated with the optimal treatment parameters and LDI ≥ 1 (n=15), the 
mean treatment effect was 74.3% (± 15.3) of intended. A direct correlation was observed 
between percent ablation effect as determined by DCE-MRI and light energy (figure 1a) as 
well as LDI (figure 1b).
15 men had residual cancer on follow-up 6 month biopsy (Table 3). Cancer was found 
within the treated lobe in 10 men, the untreated lobe in 4 men, and in both lobes in one man. 
Among all men with LDI ≥ 1 (n=17), 6 men had residual cancer on biopsy, of whom 4 had 
cancer in the treated lobe. PSA values were generally unaffected following VTP (figure 2), 
with a mean reduction of 0.11 ng/ml by 12 months. 9/11 men with residual cancer in the 
treated lobe qualified for re-treatment per trial criteria of whom 7 opted for re-treatment of 
the ipsilateral lobe. In 6/7 men, LDI ≥ 1 was achieved. On 6-month biopsy following re-
treatment, all 7 patients had a negative biopsy. Following retreatment, a total of 26 of 30 men 
had a negative biopsy in the treated lobe, and 22 of 30 treated men had a negative biopsy in 
both lobes.
Minimal, often transient, effects on urinary and sexual function, and overall quality of life, 
were observed (figures 3 and 4). Sexual function declined by 12 months for the whole 
cohort, possibly related to the VTP procedure or secondary treatment figure 3b). Adverse 
events related to treatment were reported frequently (table 4), but no DLT, SAE, or death 
was reported.
Discussion
In summary, this first, early-phase, prospective multicenter focal therapy study to be 
undertaken in the United States demonstrated safety, tolerability and efficacy of WST-11 
VTP for soft tissue ablation in cancer-bearing prostate tissue. Moreover, an optimal 
treatment condition (LDI ≥ 1) was achieved in 17 of the 30 patients enrolled, across a range 
of energy exposures. This resulted in a 74% ablation of the target volume as determined by a 
post-treatment MRI. This conferred a cancer free status in just over 70% of patients treated 
under optimal conditions Treatment was extremely well tolerated in the current study. No 
SAE or dose-limiting toxicity was observed and no significant systemic effects were 
identified. Though some degree of extraprostatic treatment effect was observed in a subset of 
men there was no secondary associated SAE or irreversible toxicity acutely or in follow up.

 Overall quality of life appeared minimally affected by the intervention based on the patient-
reported outcomes.
In the study of VTP conducted by Moore, et al, similar conclusions regarding dose, efficacy, 
and safety were made10. Among men with LDI > 1, 83% were observed to have negative 
biopsy, as compared to 31.3% with LDI < 1. In that study, the overall rate of negative biopsy 
was comparable to ours when accounting for small numbers. While the rate of negative 
biopsy after one treatment is relatively low (63.3%), in our study, as compared to previous 
series of hemi-ablation using other energies, the small numbers preclude direct comparison. 
It is possible that the learning curve, the uncertainty regarding potential toxicity, and the 
number of new operators led to a more conservative or incomplete treatment. The option of 
re-treating is a major advantage of ablative technologies, and can improve overall treatment 
outcomes, as it did in this case, with 86.7% of men demonstrating negative biopsy in the 
treated lobe after two treatments, comparable to previously published reports of 
hemiablation2,6,21–24.
It is possible that the low toxicity observed in our study was, in part, explained by the known 
mechanism of tissue destruction. WST11mediated VTP creates local tissue destruction 
through non-thermal vascular-targeted effects by a previously described biochemical 
mechanism of action triggered by the contact of drug and light16–19. Radical oxygen and 
nitrogen species, are created which secondarily induce permanent vascular thrombosis and a 
propagation of oxidative stress mediated cellular apoptosis into the tissues starting from the 
blood vessels14,1718. This novel process is in direct contradistinction to thermal dispersion 
from heat-sink effects caused by perfusing blood vessels. While this mechanism benefits 
from non-selective thrombosis of all blood vessels treatment zone, the adequacy of tissue 
destruction and the extent of apoptosis cannot be assessed in this study beyond the clinical 
endpoints utilized. Follow-up MRI obtained at 7 days following treatment demonstrated 
both confluent and contoured non-perfused tissue within the intended region of treatment 
among men receiving optimal drug and light dose, and adequate LDI, confirming the 
complete nature of vascular thrombosis.
Another novel aspect of this type of therapy is the incorporation of treatment planning from 
preoperative imaging and the intent for ablation based on volume. It seems likely that this 
contributed to the low rates of extraprostatic necrosis. Planning can only be done if there 
exists a reasonably predictable correlation between dose and effect. The relationship 
between tissue ablation effects in DCE-MRI and LDI was found to be quite good in this 
regard and supports this approach. This aspect of the technique appears favorable, allowing 
for target volume to serve as the main dependent variable when determining the number and 
length of fibers required for a given case.
In this study, a positive post-treatment biopsy in the treated lobe could be considered a 
failure of treatment, while a positive biopsy in the untreated lobe would likely be a failure of 
baseline staging. Men with cancer identified to be unilateral on 12 core trans-rectal biopsy 
carry a very high likelihood of harboring bilateral malignancy25. As pre-treatment mpMRI 
was utilized purely for treatment planning in this study, more accurate staging, presumably 
through the localization of disease by mpMRI, could likely reduce the numbers of positive

 post-treatment biopsies noted outside of the treatment zone, and allow better evaluation of 
the relationship of treatment planning and treatment failure.26,27 mpMRI in treatment 
planning has been shown to be highly sensitive in the detection of residual tumor following 
VTP.28
In addition to the method of candidate selection, additional limitations of the study design 
and interpretation include small sample size, potential for learning curve effects on quality 
of treatment given the small number of patients at individual centers, and the lack of long-
term follow-up to determine true efficacy. Despite the limitations, the study demonstrates 
that VTP focal ablation in men with localized PCa is feasible, safe, offers potential treatment 
of localized PCa with relatively minimal effects on quality of life. Further evaluation of 
oncologic efficacy through larger, randomized cohort studies and through modified selection 
criteria is warranted. The results of two, phase III studies conducted in Europa (PCM301; 
NCT01310894) and Latin America (PCM304; NCT01875393) to confirm the efficacy and 
safety profile of the technique are expected in the near term.
Conclusions
TOOKAD® Soluble VTP focal therapy of the prostate is feasible and appears safe in this 
limited study. Treatment results in relatively minimal effects on quality of life in short term 
follow-up. Treatment planning through use of MRI assessment of intended treatment 
volume, and application of LDI, can result in reproducible, confluent tissue destruction in 
the intended treatment zone.
