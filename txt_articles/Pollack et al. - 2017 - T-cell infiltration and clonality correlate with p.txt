BACKGROUND: Patients with metastatic sarcomas have poor outcomes and although the disease may be amenable to immunothera-
pies, information regarding the immunologic profiles of soft tissue sarcoma (STS) subtypes is limited. METHODS: The authors identi-
fied patients with the common STS subtypes: leiomyosarcoma, undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS), synovial sarcoma (SS),
well-differentiated/dedifferentiated liposarcoma, and myxoid/round cell liposarcoma. Gene expression, immunohistochemistry for pro-
grammed cell death protein (PD-1) and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), and T-cell receptor Vb gene sequencing were performed
on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumors from 81 patients. Differences in liposarcoma subsets also were evaluated. RESULTS: UPS
and leiomyosarcoma had high expression levels of genes related to antigen presentation and T-cell infiltration. UPS were found to have
higher levels of PD-L1 (P�.001) and PD-1 (P�.05) on immunohistochemistry and had the highest T-cell infiltration based on T-cell recep-
tor sequencing, significantly more than SS, which had the lowest (P�.05). T-cell infiltrates in UPS also were more oligoclonal compared
with SS and liposarcoma (P�.05). A model adjusted for STS histologic subtype found that for all sarcomas, T-cell infiltration and clonal-
ity were highly correlated with PD-1 and PD-L1 expression levels (P�.01). CONCLUSIONS: In the current study, the authors provide the
most detailed overview of the immune microenvironment in sarcoma subtypes to date. UPS, which is a more highly mutated STS sub-
type, provokes a substantial immune response, suggesting that it may be well suited to treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors.
The SS and liposarcoma subsets are less mutated but do express immunogenic self-antigens, and therefore strategies to improve anti-
gen
presentation
and
T-cell
infiltration
may allow
for
successful immunotherapy
in
patients with
these

INTRODUCTION
Cancer immunotherapies have induced durable responses for patients with many types of cancer.1,2 T cells engineered
with receptors that target tumor-associated antigens have antitumor activity and can induce complete and durable remis-
sions in some patients with cancer.3-7 Antibodies that block ligand engagement of T-cell checkpoint molecules such as
CTLA-4 and programmed cell death protein (PD-1) have transformed the standard of care for melanoma and lung
cancer,8,9 and hold promise for many other tumor types.
Despite these successes, much work remains to make checkpoint blockade highly effective for the majority of patients
with advanced cancers. How to best select patients, design combination strategies, and sequence regimens are areas of intense
research that will hinge on an improved understanding of the tumor immune microenvironment. Approaches to interrogate
the tumor microenvironment have included characterization of infiltrating immune cells, immunohistochemistry (IHC) to

programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), characterization of
the lymphocyte infiltrates using T-cell receptor Vb gene
(TCR-Vb) sequencing, and gene expression analysis.10-12
However, few studies in any cancer type have used multiple
modalities to understand how these different elements
interact with one another.
Soft tissue sarcomas (STS) comprise< 1% of adult
malignancies but are an ideal group of malignancies for the
study of focused questions regarding the tumor immune
microenvironment because many STS subtypes have unique
and diverse biologic features. STS often are divided biologi-
cally into 2 categories: genetically “simple” and “complex”
tumors. The simple tumors tend to have specific, reliably
identifiable oncogenic alterations (such as translocations)
and a limited number of mutated neoantigens.13,14 Synovial
sarcoma (SS) and myxoid/round cell liposarcoma (MRCL)
both are translocation-driven malignancies and often express
high levels of self-antigens, notably NY-ESO-1,15,16 which
has been targeted with promising signals of efficacy.6,17
The genetically “complex” STS tumors, such as
undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcomas (UPS) and leio-
myosarcoma (LMS), have numerous genetic mutations but
no clear oncogenic driver. Although well-differentiated/
dedifferentiated (WD/DD) liposarcomas may have a low
mutation burden and are driven through overexpression of
MDM2 and CDK4, DD liposarcomas can acquire addi-
tional mutations, ultimately becoming highly mutated.18
Highly mutated tumors are more genetically heterogeneous
and may provide multiple immunogenic mutated protein
targets for T cells, which subsequently may be inhibited at
checkpoints such as PD-1.19,20 Indeed, recently presented
provisional data have indicated that treatment with check-
point inhibitors can result in a benefit in patients with cer-
tain sarcoma subtypes such as UPS.21
Overall, the outcome of patients with advanced STS
remains poor, with a median overall survival in the region
of 12 to 18 months. The objective of the current study was
to identify key biologic patterns related to the immune
response that could potentially serve as a biological ratio-
nale for future sarcoma immunotherapy trials as well as
identify patterns that might be relevant to other solid
tumors. Because of the rarity of some STS subtypes, the
current study was focused on 4 of the more common sub-
types (including tumors with both simple and complex kar-
yotypes): 1) liposarcoma (both the WD/DD and MRCL
liposarcoma subtypes); 2) SS; 3) UPS; and 4) LMS. We
examined the expression of 760 genes, including a majority
related to immune function, using a NanoString platform
(NanoString Technologies, Seattle, Wash); PD-1 and
PD-L1 expression were examined using IHC and TCR
clonality was examined using TCR-Vb sequencing.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
Institutional Review Board approval was obtained before
commencing this study. A retrospective search of a pro-
spectively maintained database was performed to identify
consecutively listed patients with UPS, WD/DD liposar-
coma, MRCL, LMS, or SS with available tumor tissue
from the Institutional Review Board-approved, Universi-
ty of Washington/Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research
Center tissue bank. All patients consented to participate
in this tumor bank. Patients were treated at the University
of Washington/Seattle Cancer Care Alliance with surgical
resection between 2002 and 2012. Patient demographic
data and histological characteristics were obtained from
the database and chart review. In all cases, an experienced
soft tissue pathologist confirmed the histological diagnosis
and tumor grade. The French Federation of Comprehen-
sive Cancer Centers (FNCLCC) grading system was used
to grade tumors.22 A hematoxylin-and-eosin-stained
specimen was prepared from all tumor blocks to confirm
the presence of viable tumor from each sample.
NanoString Gene Expression Analysis
nCounter gene expression assay: preparing the
RNA lysate
Before making the cellular RNA lysate, tissue sections
were deparaffinized in xylene 3 times at 5 minutes each
and then rehydrated by immersing consecutively in 100%
ethanol twice for 2 minutes each time, 95% ethanol for 2
minutes, and 70% ethanol for 2 minutes and then were
immersed in distilled water until they were ready to be
processed. Tissue was lysed on the slide by adding 10 to
50 lL of PKD buffer (Qiagen Inc, Gaithersburg, Md).
Tissue was scraped from the slide and transferred to a 1.5-
mL Eppendorf tube. Proteinase K (Roche Molecular Sys-
tems Inc, Branchburg, NJ) was added at � 10% of the
final volume and the RNA lysate was incubated for 15
minutes at 558C and then for 15 minutes at 808C. The
Qubit Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham,
Mass) then was used for quantification. The RNA lysate
was stored at -808C until gene expression profiling was
performed using the NanoString nCounter system
(NanoString Technologies).
NanoString methodology
Per sample, 50 ng (RNA content) from the cellular lysate
in a final volume of 5 lL was mixed with a 3’ biotinylated

 capture probe and a 5’ reporter probe tagged with a fluo-
rescent barcode from the desired gene expression code set.
Probes and target transcripts were hybridized overnight
at 658C for 12 to 16 hours as per the manufacturer’s rec-
ommendations. Hybridized samples were run on the
NanoString nCounter preparation station using their
high-sensitivity protocol in which excess capture and
reporter probes were removed and transcript-specific ter-
nary complexes were immobilized on a streptavidin-
coated cartridge. The samples were scanned at maximum
scan resolution capabilities using the nCounter Digital
Analyzer (NanoString Technologies).23,24
Analysis of NanoString data
Data analysis was performed using quantile normaliza-
tion, in which relative ranks of genes (across all genes on
the NanoString code set) within each sample were
replaced by values having the same relative rank from the
pooled distribution (from all samples and genes in the
data set). Normalization was performed using nSolver
software (NanoString Technologies). All quantile normal-
ized data underwent subsequent log10 transformation.
Individual genes were compared using an analysis of vari-
ance (ANOVA) and if the P value was <.05 (Turkey mul-
tiple comparison test), these genes were included using an
unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis. The individual
reduced gene lists for each region then were analyzed in
ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) (Qiagen) using CORE
analysis to try and help to identify whether they had any
significant relationships or associations with known func-
tions or pathways. These predefined networks within the
IPA (grouping genes by function, pathway, disease associ-
ation, etc) are manually curated from a consortium of
published articles and public data. Although this analysis
was not used to demonstrate associations between specific
genes and STS subtype, it was used to identify potential
genes of interest.
Immunohistochemistry
Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks
were deparaffinized and rehydrated with serial passage
through changes of xylene and graded ethanols for PD-L1
and PD-1 IHC. All slides were subjected to heat-induced
epitope retrieval in Envision FLEX Target Retrieval Solu-
tion, High pH (Dako Corporation, Carpinteria, Calif).
Endogenous peroxidase in tissues was blocked by incuba-
tion of slides in 3% hydrogen peroxide solution before
incubation with the primary antibody (anti-PD-L1 clone
22C3 [Merck Research Laboratories, Palo Alto, Calif] or
anti-PD-1 clone NAT105 [Cell Marque, Rocklin, Calif])
for 60 minutes. Antigen-antibody binding was visualized
with the FLEX 1 polymer system (Dako) and application
of 3,3’ diaminobenzidine chromogen (Dako). Stained
slides were counterstained with hematoxylin and cover-
slipped for review and scoring. Scoring was conducted by
a pathologist (J.H.Y.) who was blinded to all patient clini-
cal information using a semiquantitative scale of 0 to 5, in
which positive cell frequency within the tumor tissue was
grouped into the following categories: 0 indicates nega-
tive, 1 indicates rare, 2 indicates low, 3 indicates moder-
ate, 4 indicates high, and 5 indicates very high. These
patterns are illustrated for both PD-1 and PD-L1 in
Supporting Information Figure 1.
Analysis of PD-1 and PD-L1 expression
Detectable PD-L1 and PD-1 expression was defined as an
IHC score >0. A score > 2 was used to delineate tumors
with higher levels of expression. Binary variables were
compared using a chi-square test, and continuous varia-
bles were compared using a Student t test by PD-L1/PD-1
status. The relationship between tumor size and PD-L1
expression was analyzed independent of histology using a
logistical model, which included tumor size as a continu-
ous variable. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to esti-
mate overall survival (defined as the time from diagnosis
to death), progression-free survival (PFS; defined as the
time from diagnosis to disease progression or death), and
recurrence-free survival (defined as the time from defini-
tive surgery to disease recurrence or death) and compared
between patient groups with the log-rank statistic. Cox
proportional hazards models were used to estimate the
hazard ratio and associated 95% confidence interval for
defined groups of patients.
TCR-b Immunosequencing
DNA extraction of FFPE preserved solid tumor curls and
TCR-b immunosequencing were performed at Adaptive
Biotechnologies Corporation (Seattle, Wash) as previous-
ly described.25-27 In brief, DNA was extracted and TCR-
b complementarity determining region 3 regions were
amplified using a multiplexed polymerase chain reaction
method with 54 forward primers specific to TCR-Vb
gene segments and 13 reverse primers specific to TCR-Jb
gene segments. Next, the Illumina HiSeq platform
(Illumina Inc, San Diego, Calif) was used to sequence the
resulting amplicons. Housekeeping genes also were ampli-
fied, and their template counts quantitated to determine
the amount of DNA usable for TCR-b sequencing. The
number of total cells and T cells, the T-cell fraction, the
number of unique rearrangements, and clonality were

 calculated for each sample. A Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon
test was used to compare TCR sequencing metrics
between histologic subtypes.
Integrative Analysis of Multiple Assays
NanoString gene expression data were normalized with
the median- median absolute deviation normalization
method for each sample in the log2 scale. A linear model
was constructed to investigate the association between the
T-cell fraction and TCR clonality and the normalized
NanoString gene expression. For analysis of clonality and
T-cell fraction with IHC staining, a model was con-
structed using only histology as an adjusting factor.
RESULTS
Clinical Demographics
Archival tumor samples were selected from 81 patients
with a median age of 53 years (range, 18-57 years) who
had provided written informed consent to the University
of Washington/Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center
tumor bank (Table 1). FNCLCC is the standard grading
system used at the study institution, and we verified that
this system was used in 77 of the 81 cases (>95%).22 A
total of 34 tumors (42%) were high grade (grade 3), 31
tumors (38%) were intermediate grade (grade 2), and 15
tumors (19%) were low grade (grade 1). The median
tumor size was 9 cm (range, 1.2-40 cm).
Specimens from the patients who provided consent
to the tumor bank included liposarcoma (27 specimens),
LMS (19 specimens), UPS (20 specimens), and SS (15
specimens). Although the UPS generally were undifferen-
tiated, 2 of these tumors had areas with a spindle cell
appearance and 1 contained areas of tumor with myoid
differentiation. Of the 27 liposarcomas, there were 15
WD/DD tumors, including 9 tumors with dedifferentia-
tion and 6 aggressive WD liposarcomas (meaning either
tumors measuring >10 cm or tumors that were recurrent/
refractory). The other 12 liposarcoma specimens had
MRCL histology. LMS tumors were not selected for hav-
ing uterine (2 specimens) versus nonuterine (17 speci-
mens) origin. Thirteen of the 15 SS tumors had
monophasic histology. Patients had a mix of different
clinical outcomes. Of the 81 patients, 38 (47%) devel-
oped metastatic disease, and 44 patients (54%) were alive
at the time of last follow-up. Although the majority of
specimens were from the resection of the primary tumor,
18 (22%) were from a recurrence of a metastatic lesion. A
total of 36 patients (44%) with tumors examined in the
current study had received no neoadjuvant chemotherapy
or radiotherapy before undergoing surgical resection. A
total of 21 patients (26%) received neoadjuvant chemo-
therapy alone and 17 patients (21%) had received neoadju-
vant chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Prior chemotherapy
(P<.01) but not radiotherapy (P 5 .59) was found to be
associated with histology.

 functions. Sufficient RNA for NanoString analysis was
obtained in 18 of 19 LMS samples (95%), 24 of 27 lipo-
sarcoma samples (89%), 18 of 20 UPS samples (90%),
and all 15 SS samples (100%), for a total of 75 of 81 sam-
ples (93%). An initial unsupervised clustering analysis
including all samples and genes initially was performed to
observe broad patterns in histologic subtype and gene
expression clusters. This analysis generally separated out
the individual histologic subtype with few exceptions (see
Supporting Information Fig. 2).
Cluster analysis and IPA
To focus on the differential gene expression between STS
subtypes, genes were analyzed in a subsequent unsupervised
clustering analysis only if there was a P value < .05 con-
firming a difference in expression levels between at least 2
STS subtypes (Fig. 1A). This analysis identified 367 of the
760 genes as being significantly different between the sub-
groups (48%). Seven gene regions were defined within this
analysis (Fig. 1A) using the dendrogram tree generated by
the unsupervised clustering. The genes in each region are
detailed in Supporting Information Table 1. The individu-
al reduced genes in each region then were analyzed in IPA
using CORE analysis to help identify whether they had any
relationships or associations with known functions or path-
ways. These predefined networks within IPA (grouping
genes by function, pathway, disease association, etc) previ-
ously had been curated manually from a consortium of
published articles and public data.
Genes related to antigen presentation
One of the strongest associations identified using IPA was
with the “antigen presentation pathway” and group 6, a
group of genes whose calculated variance demonstrates
higher differential expression in UPS and LMS and lower
differential expression in liposarcomas (WD/DD) and SS.
Human leukocyte antigen A (HLA-A), HLA-B, and
HLA-C are critical genes for antigen presentation and are
absolutely necessary for the recognition of tumor cells by
conventional CD8-positive T cells. For each of these,
UPS and LMS were found to have the highest expression,
an expression level that was significantly higher than that
for SS (HLA-A, P<.0001 [Fig. 1B]; others shown in Sup-
porting Information Fig. 3A). A similar pattern was
observed in the noncanonical HLA molecule HLA-G
(Fig. 1B), as well as class II HLA genes such as HLA-
DPB1 (see Supporting Information Fig. 3A). TAP1
(transporter-associated with antigen processing 1), a criti-
cal element of major histocompatibility complex (MHC)/
peptide loading, also had significantly higher expression
in UPS compared with all other subtypes with the excep-
tion of LMS (P 5 .0052) (Fig. 1B).
T-cell-related genes
Group 6 also had notable overlap with genes associated in
the canonical pathways of “communication between
adaptive and innate immune cells” as well as “cytotoxic T-
lymphocyte-mediated apoptosis of target cells.” CD3D,
part of the CD3 complex and therefore a marker for T-
cell infiltration, and CD8A, part of CD8 and therefore a
marker of CD8-positive T cells, were included in this
zone. CD8A is shown in Supporting Information Figure
3, as is interleukin 2 receptor subunit alpha (IL-2RA),
which also may be associated with T-cell-mediated
inflammation. CD3D expression was found to be highest
in LMS and UPS specimens and was significantly higher
for LMS compared with MRCL (P 5 .0089) (Fig. 1C).
The IL-7 receptor (CD127, IL-7R) often is expressed on
activated and antigen-experienced T cells and was found
to be significantly higher for UPS and LMS (P 5 .0021)
(Fig. 1C). IDO is a key regulator affecting these cells and
also demonstrated a trend toward higher expression in
UPS and LMS specimens (see Supporting Information
Fig. 3B) as did the T-cell markers CD4, CD27, and
CD28, as well as the chemokine receptor/ligands CCL5
and CCR5. Genes in zones 1 and 4 had higher calculated
variance in UPS and LMS specimens; this included
CD274 (PD-L1), in which a strong trend toward higher
expression in UPS and LMS specimens was noted, sugges-
ting
that
further
analysis
would
be
warranted.
PDCD1LG2 (PD-L2) was included in zone 5, in which
genes had higher variance in UPS compared with any oth-
er subtype (Fig. 1D).
Other notable genes also are shown in Supporting
Information Figure 3. A separate K-means clustering anal-
ysis of the same 367 genes also was performed (see Sup-
porting
Information
Fig.
4)
(genes
are
listed
in
Supporting Information Table 2). This analysis highlight-
ed the importance of tumor-associated macrophages
(TAM) in LMS, confirming observations made in prior
studies (Fig. 1E).28,29 A trend toward more regulatory T-
cell gene signatures was observed in UPS and LMS speci-
mens and some liposarcoma cases (see Supporting Infor-
mation Figs. 5 and 6).
Immune-related gene expression in MRCL versus
WD/DD
In our initial cluster analysis, all liposarcoma specimens
were analyzed together. However, through our analysis of
individual genes, we recognized that there were important

 differences in the immunobiology of these 2 biologically
distinct entities. To parse the differences between the
MRCL and WD/DD, a similar cluster analysis based on
calculated variance was performed on only the liposar-
coma tumors, which demonstrated markedly different
expression patterns between these liposarcoma subsets
(see Supporting Information Fig. 7) (individual genes are
shown in Supporting Information Table 3). Again using
IPA and CORE analysis, predefined interferon-related
gene groups and TCR synapse-related groups were found
to demonstrate higher variance in gene expression in the
WD/DD tumors.10,11 We suspected that DD tumors
would have higher levels of inflammatory genes compared
with WD tumors because they often acquire additional
genetic mutations,30 and we observed a nonsignificant
trend in support of this (see Supporting Information
Fig. 8).
Increased PD-L1 and PD-1 Expression Are Noted
in UPS
The pattern that emerged from the above gene expression
analysis was that UPS had high expression of genes that
were related to both antigen presentation and T-cell-
mediated immunity. LMS also generally had high expres-
sion of these genes, whereas SS and MRCL specimens
were found to have lower expression. We were interested
to learn whether this expression pattern would carry over
to PD-L1 protein expression, which was suggested based
on the RNA expression data and would have potential
therapeutic implications (Fig. 1B). Several studies to date
have examined the presence or absence of PD-1 and PD-
L1 in STS samples, but to the best of our knowledge none
has scored the level of protein expression based on
IHC.31,32 We stained FFPE sections by IHC and scored
them using a scoring system of 0 to � 5 as described above
and illustrated in Supporting Information Figure 1.
Among all 81 patients, 48 (59%) expressed PD-L1,
and 73 (90%) had detectable PD-1-expressing cells within
the tumor. We expected to find PD-1-expressing lympho-
cytes in PD-L1-expressing tumors, and indeed all patients
with PD-L1-expressing tumors were found to have at least
some PD-1-expressing cells within the tumor (see Sup-
porting Information Table 4A). Furthermore, only 2
tumors with PD-L1 expression of � 2 were found to have
PD-1 expression of < 2. A total of 28 tumors (35%) had
levels of PD-L1 expression of � 2 (see Supporting Infor-
mation Table 4B), and 41 tumors (51%) had levels of
PD-1 expression of � 2.
Higher grade tumors were associated with higher
expression levels of both PD-L1 (P 5 .03) and PD-1
(P 5 .05). Neither prior chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or
the combination were associated with higher levels of

 PD-L1 expression or an increased frequency of PD-1-
expressing lymphocytes. Although the current study was
not designed to examine the impact of PD-L1 or PD-1 on
PFS or overall survival, the analysis was performed and
did not reveal a statistically significant impact for this rela-
tively small cohort of patients.
Detectable PD-L1 was noted in each of the STS sub-
types tested and PD-1-expressing lymphocytes were
observed in a majority of tumors in each subtype (Figs.
2A-2D [LMS]). Although numerically fewer UPS were
entirely negative for PD-L1, this was not statistically sig-
nificant (P 5 .16). However, UPS had higher levels of
PD-L1 expression (P 5 .001) and PD-1 expression
(P 5 .05) compared with other sarcoma subtypes (Fig.
2E). UPS also had higher levels of expression compared
with the WD/DD and MRCL subsets of liposarcoma, as
well as the nonuterine subset of LMS for both PD-L1
(P 5 .05) and PD-1 (P 5 .001) (Table 2).
High (�4) or very high (�5) expression of PD-L1
was observed in 10 tumors, including 7 UPS and 3 LMS.
Seven tumors had high or very high PD-1 expression,
including 3 UPS and 2 LMS. In contrast, very few of the
translocation-related tumors (SS or MRCL) were found
to have high PD-1 or PD-L1 expression. For example,
even though 100% of the SS tumors had some PD-1
expression, none had either �4 or � 5 PD-1 expression.

 Only 4 SS tumors (27%) and none of the 12 MRCL
tumors had > 2 1 expression for PD-L1 (see Supporting
Information Fig. 9).
UPS and LMS Have Higher TCR-Vb Clonality
Compared With SS and MRCL
Given that we noted higher expression of inflammatory-
type genes in UPS and LMS as well as increased PD-1 and
PD-L1 expression in UPS, we hypothesized that these
tumors would have a more robust and focused T-cell
response, and sought to confirm this through immunose-
quencing of the TCR-Vb complementarity determining
region 3 variable region of each tumor. FFPE tissue was
available for immunosequencing for 72 of the 81 samples.
Seven samples were filtered from further analysis because
they yielded sequence data corresponding to <100 total
cells or < 10 T cells. Among the 65 included samples, we
observed an average of 18,545 total cells (range, 310-
81,531 total cells), and an average of 1697 T cells (range,
11-28,449 T cells). The average number of unique TCR
sequences observed was 664 (range, 9-4500 sequences).
The maximum productive clonal frequency was 42.31%.
The mean T-cell fraction, defined as the number of T cells
in the sample divided by the total number of nucleated
cells, was 0.097 (range, 0-0.720). Clonality, a metric char-
acterizing the TCR distribution, in which more oligoclo-
nal TCR repertoires are closer to 1 and more evenly (or
randomly) distributed repertoires are closer to 0,25-27 was
0.110 (range, 0.029-0.397) for the group. The distribu-
tion of clonality and TCR fractions for the group as a
whole is depicted in Supporting Information Figures 10
and 11.
To have greater statistical power, liposarcomas were
grouped together for further analysis. UPS (17 specimens)
numerically had the highest T-cell fraction compared
with all other sarcoma subtypes (mean T-cell fraction,
0.145) and were only statistically significantly different
from SS (12 specimens; mean T-cell fraction, 0.044
[P � .01]) (Fig. 3A) and MRCL (11 specimens; mean T-
cell fraction, 0.064 [P � .05]). WD/DD liposarcoma (9
specimens; mean T cell fraction, 0.107) also had a signifi-
cantly higher T-cell fraction compared with SS (P � .01).
The average T-cell fraction for LMS (16 specimens) was
0.096.
We analyzed the clonality of the different STS sub-
types (Fig. 3B). We found that LMS (mean, 0.136) and
UPS (mean, 0.151) specimens both had higher clonality
scores than WD/DD liposarcoma (mean, 0.0759),
MRCL (mean, 0.0615), and SS (mean, 0.084) specimens,
reflecting a more oligoclonal T-cell repertoire (individual
P value significance levels are indicated in Fig. 3B) (LMS
and UPS as a group had significantly higher clonality
[P<.01]). We also compared the maximum clonal fre-
quency among the groups. UPS was found to have the
highest average maximum clonal frequency (10.32%),
although the only statistically significant difference was
observed
between
UPS
and
WD/DD
liposarcoma
(P � .05) (Fig. 3C).
Neither prior radiotherapy nor chemotherapy were
found to be associated with T-cell fraction or clonality
even when adjusted for histology. Although these data

 were not powered to detect a relationship between clonal-
ity and survival, this was examined and no statistically sig-
nificant correlation was observed. Neither was any
association with prior chemotherapy or radiotherapy not-
ed. Comparing the WD (4 specimens) with the DD (6
specimens) liposarcoma tumors, there were no significant
differences noted with regard to clonality (0.062 vs 0.060,
respectively) or maximum clonal frequency (0.057 vs
0.037; P 5 .17). In fact, the average T-cell fraction of
WD (0.149) was actually higher than that of DD (0.55),
as a result of one outlier WD tumor with a very high T-
cell fraction (0.39).
PD-1 and PD-L1 Are Correlated With TCR
Fraction and Clonality Adjusted For Histology
Our analysis indicated that UPS had a more inflammatory
microenvironment than the other sarcoma subtypes. LMS
and WD/DD liposarcoma tumors also appeared to share
this inflammatory phenotype, although to a lesser degree
and not by every metric. SS and MRCL generally had a
noninflammatory phenotype. We then sought to integrate
these data sets into an analysis that would look for a gener-
al correlation among all patients with sarcoma. No genes
in this data set were found to have a statistically significant
association with overall survival or recurrence-free survival
in a Cox model adjusted for tumor grade. Gene expression
was normalized with the median- median absolute devia-
tion normalization method for each sample in the log2
scale. The clonality and T-cell fraction were log2 trans-
formed to correct for the skewness of the data. A linear
model was constructed to investigate the association
between the clonality score of TCR sequencing and the
normalized NanoString gene expression. Linear regression
variable selection was conducted to search for possible
confounding factors such as histology, tumor grade,
tumor size, and marginal analysis. Histologic subtype was
found to have a strong association with clonality
(P 5 .0168). After adjusting for STS subtype, the expres-
sion levels of 4 genes were found to be significantly associ-
ated with clonality at a qvalue < 0.2 (see Supporting
Information Table 5). These genes included NKG7,
SLAMF6, CXCL9, and ITK (Fig. 4A).23
We also tested whether after adjusting for histology
there would be correlation of genes with the T-cell frac-
tion. The top 18 genes with a P value < 1025 are shown
in Supporting Information Table 6. Although many of
these genes were directly related to the T-cell infiltration,
many also were related to antigen presentation. In fact,
the 2 genes with the most significant correlation were class
II MHC molecules HLA-DPB1 (P 5 1.38 3 10212) and
HLA-DRA (3.3 3 10212). The third most significant
association also was related to class II antigen presenta-
tion: CD74 (P 5 1.26 3 1029). None of these associa-
tions were explained in an analysis including prior
chemotherapy or radiotherapy.
We then sought to test whether PD-1 and PD-L1
expression scores were correlated with T-cell fraction and
clonality (Fig. 4B) (see Supporting Information Table 7)
using a model that adjusted only for histology. T-cell frac-
tion was found to be significantly associated with both
PD-1 (P 5 .00304) and PD-L1 (P 5 .00638). To deter-
mine whether this association was due to a random influx
of T cells into the tumor or a more organized tumor-
specific infiltrate, we also tested whether clonality was
associated with these staining patterns and clonality also
was found to be significantly associated with both PD-1
(P 5 .00711) and PD-L1 (P 5 .00369).
DISCUSSION
Outcomes for patients with metastatic STS remain
poor.33 The standard first-line therapy for patients with
metastatic STS is doxorubicin, with an overall response
rate of 20% to 30% and a median PFS of approximately
4.6 months.34-36 Although new drugs recently have been
approved for metastatic STS that may add valuable addi-
tional months of survival for patients, there remains a
clear need for therapies capable of inducing deep and
durable responses.37,38
Immunotherapy has been relatively slow to be evalu-
ated in sarcoma. To the best of our knowledge, the current
study provides the most detailed characterization of the
immune phenotype for the most common individual STS
subtypes to date. This analysis included UPS, a highly
mutated tumor type. Our analysis suggests these muta-
tions may contribute to greater immunogenicity of this
subtype, and result in the robust and more oligoclonal T-
cell infiltrates observed herein. This tumor appears to fit
the classic model of an inflammatory-type tumor, which
is an ideal target for checkpoint inhibition, with high
expression of genes related to antigen expression and T-
cell-mediated apoptosis, high PD-1 and PD-L1 expres-
sion, and high TCR clonality. A caveat is that genes relat-
ed to antigen presentation, including class I HLA
molecules, are expressed on T cells and this could contrib-
ute to the increase in HLA-related genes observed in these
tumors. Clearly, future work will need to examine MHC
expression on tumor cells, and the function and specificity
of the infiltrating T cells to determine whether they have
the potential to recognize and lyse the tumors they
inhabit.

 Recent presentations have suggested disappointing
activity of single-agent PD-1 inhibition in patients with
LMS.39,40 Conversely, the findings of the current study
suggest that LMS is an inflammatory tumor type with
high levels of T-cell-related gene expression, with several
tumors demonstrating very strong expression of PD-L1
and containing PD-1-expressing cells. Nevertheless, we
suspect that combination therapy may be necessary to
treat these tumors because other investigators have sug-
gested that immunosuppressive tumor-associated macro-
phages may be critical to immune evasion in these
tumors.29,41,42 Combinations of checkpoint inhibitors
with drugs aimed at depleting or modulating these cells
may prove successful in providing durable responses for
these patients.
Likewise, WD/DD liposarcoma has many features of
a highly inflammatory tumor such as a high T-cell fraction
and relatively high HLA expression. However, unlike LMS
and UPS, it had a low TCR clonality and few patients were
found to have high PD-L1 expression. Given that these
tumors have been observed to respond to checkpoint inhi-
bition,39 further study certainly is warranted. Additional
study regarding the differences between WD and DD
tumors also would be instructive. In the current study, we
did not observe significant differences but this study was
not designed or powered to examine these differences.
However, because a given patient may have both WD and
DD tumors, immunotherapy ideally will have activity
against both histologies. It may be that the addition of a
tyrosine kinase inhibitor (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier
NCT023636725) or chemotherapeutic agent (Clinical-
Trials.gov identifier NCT02888665) may increase the
potency of checkpoint inhibition for patients with LMS
and WD/DD liposarcoma.
SS and MRCL may pose a more complex challenge
with regard to immunotherapy. These tumors expressed
fewer inflammatory-type genes and, fittingly, had less
staining for PD-L1 and had fewer PD-1 infiltrating cells.
SS tumors had a significantly lower T-cell fraction, maxi-
mum clonal frequency, and clonality. Nearly all of the SS
tumors in the current study were monophasic, and future
studies should confirm these findings in biphasic tumors.
The data from the current study suggest that both
SS and MRCL tumors evade immune recognition
through mechanisms other than PD-L1, possibly via
expression of lower levels of MHC, which is suggested by
the gene expression data. Although these data suggest that
checkpoint inhibition may not be an effective initial treat-
ment of these tumors, both SS and MRCL often express
the
highly
immunogenic
protein
NY-ESO-1.43,44
Approaches using adoptive T-cell transfer and vaccination
both currently are being investigated in these sarcomas,
and analysis of tumors before and after therapy may reveal
whether adaptive resistance mediated by upregulation of
PD-L1 occurs.45,46 Given that these patients have NY-
ESO-1-specific T cells in their blood capable of recogniz-
ing and lysing tumor cells,43 it may be that additional
immune manipulation will be required to increase T-cell
infiltration into the tumor, and tumor MHC expression.
Further study of the SS and MRCL tumor microenviron-
ment may alter currently ongoing investigations such as
vaccine plus PD-L1 inhibitor trials (ClinicalTrials.gov
identifier NCT02609984) or adoptive T-cell therapy
(ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01343043).
The impact of radiotherapy and chemotherapy on
immune-related genes is an important direction for future
study. Although none of the associations noted in the cur-
rent analysis were impacted by prior radiation exposure,
we know that radiation can have an important impact on
the expression of immune-related genes. The current
study was not designed to examine the impact of prior
therapy on immune-related gene expression. Among all
STS samples, we found a significant correlation between
both the T-cell fraction and clonality with PD-1 and PD-
L1 expression regardless of STS subtype. This association
was true across a diverse set of tumors, including highly
mutated UPS as well as the genetically simpler SS and
MRCL tumors.15,16 This observation supports the sug-
gestion that inflamed tumors are better targets for check-
point inhibition. Tumors with robust T-cell infiltration
produce interferon c and other cytokines, which in turn
upregulate PD-L1 and other inhibitory ligands. Thus,
these tumors are dependent on these checkpoints for
immune evasion.
In the current study, we did not perform whole-
exome sequencing to confirm the mutational load for
each patient, but this clearly requires assessment. This
analysis was not designed to examine the impact of
radiotherapy on the sarcoma tumor micro-environment
(TME) as well as the effect of prior chemotherapy/
radiotherapy on the TME, but again these are areas that
require further study and will be highly relevant to the
SARC032 trial evaluating neoadjuvant pembrolizumab.
We believe that comprehensive immune profiling
using multiple methodologies, in combination with the
evaluation of clinical responses after immunotherapeutic
intervention, will be important for establishing predictive
algorithms. Dissection of the tumor immune microenvi-
ronment and precise understanding of the mechanisms of
immune evasion for individual patients will be key to the
