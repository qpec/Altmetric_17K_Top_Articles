Context: Common concerns when using low-calorie diets as a treatment for obesity are the
reduction in fat-free mass, mostly muscular mass, that occurs together with the fat mass (FM)
loss, and determining the best methodologies to evaluate body composition changes.
Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the very-low-calorie ketogenic (VLCK) diet-induced changes
in body composition of obese patients and to compare 3 different methodologies used to evaluate
those changes.
Design: Twenty obese patients followed a VLCK diet for 4 months. Body composition assessment
was performed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), multifrequency bioelectrical
impedance (MF-BIA), and air displacement plethysmography (ADP) techniques. Muscular
strength was also assessed. Measurements were performed at 4 points matched with the ketotic
phases (basal, maximum ketosis, ketosis declining, and out of ketosis).
Results: After 4 months the VLCK diet induced a 220.2 6 4.5 kg weight loss, at expenses of re-
ductions in fat mass (FM) of 216.5 6 5.1 kg (DXA), 218.2 6 5.8 kg (MF-BIA), and 217.7 6 9.9 kg
(ADP). A substantial decrease was also observed in the visceral FM. The mild but marked reduction in
fat-free mass occurred at maximum ketosis, primarily as a result of changes in total body water, and
was recovered thereafter. No changes in muscle strength were observed. A strong correlation was
evidenced between the 3 methods of assessing body composition.
Conclusion: The VLCK diet-induced weight loss was mainly at the expense of FM and visceral mass;
muscle mass and strength were preserved. Of the 3 body composition techniques used, the MF-BIA
method seems more convenient in the clinical setting. (J Clin Endocrinol Metab 102: 488–498, 2017)
E
xcess fat mass (FM), especially visceral fat, is asso-
ciated with a variety of pathological conditions such
as hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, and even cancer
(1–4), as well as an increase in overall and cardiovascular
mortality (2, 5). Very-low-calorie diets are commonly
used as obesity treatments; however, a primary concern in
using such diets is the amount of fat-free mass (FFM; i.e.,
muscular tissue) that is lost together with the FM (6). This
could produce so-called sarcopenic obesity, that is, the
coexistence of an excess of FM and a decline in FFM

 that yields a near-normal body weight (7). Sarcopenic
obesity constitutes a double impact on the health of pa-
tients, because the reduction in muscle mass and muscle
strength is also a cause of cardiometabolic disorders, such
as myocardial infarction and stroke, and other adverse
health outcomes (5, 7–9). For these reasons, it is of primary
interest to find weight loss strategies that promote pref-
erential loss of FM and preservation of muscle mass and its
functional status (i.e., muscle strength) (10–12).
Some previous studies have suggested that very-low-
calorie ketogenic (VLCK) diets may be effective tools to
manage overweight and obesity (10, 11, 13). VLCK diets
are a nutritional intervention that emulate fasting by
restricting carbohydrates and fat with a relative increase
in protein intake (6). The increased protein content may
be partially responsible for the muscle mass preservation
(12–14). Importantly, the weight-reducing action of these
diets is rapid, and despite the fact that the ketosis state
lasts only 60 to 90 days at the start of treatment, the
weight reduction remains for up to 2 years (13).
Therefore, VLCK diets operate by potent mechanisms to
induce weight loss, and various body compartments
might be altered. To the best of our knowledge, no studies
have exhaustively assessed the changes in body compo-
sition associated with this type of diet, and variations in
muscle strength have been only assessed in athletes (15).
Hence, the 2 main objectives of this study were to assess
the changes in body composition and muscle strength
promoted by a VLCK diet in the treatment of obese patients
and to compare different methodologies used to evaluate
body composition. To achieve this, body composition was
evaluated by 3 potent and well-validated techniques: dual-
energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), multifrequency
bioelectrical impedance analysis (MF-BIA), and air dis-
placement plethysmography (ADP) at different stagesduring
the weight reduction process induced by a VLCK diet.
Materials and Methods
Study design
This study was a nutritional intervention clinical trial and
was open, uncontrolled, prospective for 4 months, and per-
formed in a single center.
Study population
The patients attending the Obesity Unit at the Complejo
Hospitalario Universitario of Santiago de Compostela, Spain,
for treatment of obesity were consecutively invited to participate
in this study.
The inclusion criteria were ages 18 to 65 years, body mass
index (BMI) $30 kg/m2, stable body weight in the previous
3 months, a desire to lose weight, and a history of failed dietary
efforts. The main exclusion criteria were diabetes mellitus, obesity
induced by other endocrine disorders or by drugs, and partici-
pation in any active weight loss program in the previous 3 months.
In addition, those patients with previous bariatric surgery, known
or suspected abuse of narcotics or alcohol, severe depression or
any other psychiatric disease, severe hepaticinsufficiency, any type
of renal insufficiency or gout episodes, nephrolithiasis, neoplasia,
previous events of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease,
uncontrolled hypertension, orthostatic hypotension, and hydro-
electrolytic or electrocardiographic alterations were excluded.
Females who were pregnant, breastfeeding, or intending to be-
come pregnant, and those with child-bearing potential who were
not using adequate contraceptive methods, were also excluded.
Apart from obesity and metabolic syndrome, participants were
generally healthy individuals.
The study protocol was in accordance with the Declaration
of Helsinki and was approved by the Ethics Committee for
Clinical Research of Galicia, Santiago de Compostela, Spain
(registry 2010/119). Participants gave informed consent before
any intervention related to the study. Participants received no
monetary incentive.
Nutritional intervention
All of the patients followed a VLCK diet according to a
commercial weight loss program (PNK Method), which in-
cludes lifestyle and behavioral modification support. The in-
tervention included an evaluation by the specialist physician
conducting the study and assessment by an expert dietician. All
patients underwent a structured program of physical exercise
with external supervision (16). This method is based on high-
biological-value protein preparations obtained from cow milk,
soya, avian eggs, green peas, and cereals. Each preparation
contained 15 g protein, 4 g carbohydrates, 3 g fat, and 50 mg
docosahexaenoic acid, and provided 90 to 100 kcal (16).
The weight loss program has 5 steps (Supplemental Fig. 1) and
adheres to the most recent (2015) European Food Safety Authority
guidelines on total carbohydrate intake (17). The first 3 steps
consist of a VLCK diet (600 to 800 kcal/d), which is low in car-
bohydrates [, 50 g (26 to 30 g) per day from vegetables] and lipids
(only 10 g of olive oil per day). The amount of high-biological-
value proteins range from 0.8 to 1.2 g per kg of ideal body weight
to ensure minimal body requirements are met and to prevent the
loss of lean mass. In step 1, the patients consumed high-biological-
value protein preparations 5timesper day, andvegetables withlow
glycemic indexes. In step 2, 1 of the protein servings was replaced
by a natural protein (e.g., meat or fish) either at lunch or at dinner.
In step 3, a second serving of low-fat natural protein replaced the
second serving of biological protein. Throughout the ketogenic
phases, supplements of vitamins and minerals, such as K, Na, Mg,
Ca, and omega-3 fatty acids, were provided in accordance with
international recommendations (18). These first 3 steps were
maintained until the patient lost the target amount of weight,
ideally 80%. Hence, the ketogenic steps were variable in time,
depending on the individual and the weight loss target.
In steps 4 and 5, the ketogenic phases were ended by the
physician in charge of the patient based on the amount of weight
lost, and the patient started a low-caloriediet (800 to 1500 kcal/d).
At this point, the patients underwent a progressive incorporation
of different food groups and participated in a program of ali-
mentary re-education to guarantee long-term maintenance of the
weight loss. The maintenance diet consisted of an eating plan that
was balanced with respect to carbohydrates, protein, and fat.
Depending on the individual, the calories consumed ranged be-
tween 1500 and 2000 kcal/d, and the objective was to maintain
the weight loss and promote a healthy lifestyle.

 During the study, patients followed the different steps of the
method until reaching the target weight or up to a maximum of
4 months of follow-up, although patients remained under
medical supervision for the subsequent months.
Schedule of visits
Throughout the study, the patients completed a maximum of
10 visits with the research team (every 15 6 2 days), of which 4
were for a complete physical, anthropometric, and biochemical
assessment; the remaining visits were to manage adherence and
evaluation of potential side effects. These 4 visits were made
according to the evolution of each patient through the steps of
ketosis as follows: visit C-1 (baseline), normal level of ketone
bodies; visit C-2, maximum ketosis; visit C-3, reduction of ketotic
approach because of partial reintroduction of normal nutrition;
visit C-4, no ketosis (Supplemental Fig. 1). The total ketosis state
lasted for 60 to 90 days only. In all of the visits, patients received
dietary instructions, individual supportive counsel, and encour-
agement to exercise on a regular basis using a formal exercise
program. Additionally, a program of telephone reinforcement
calls was instituted, and a phone number was provided to all
participants to address any concerns.
Anthropometric assessment
All anthropometric measurements were undertaken after an
overnight fast (8 to 10 hours), under resting conditions, in
duplicate, and performed by well-trained health workers.
Participants’ body weights were measured to the nearest 0.1 kg
on the same calibrated electronic device (Seca 220 scale; Seca
North America, Chino, CA), in underwear and without shoes.
BMI was calculated by dividing body weight by the height
squared [BMI = weight (kg)/height2 (m)]. Waist circumference
was recorded with a standard flexible nonelastic metric tape at
the middle point between the lower edge of the ribs and the iliac
anterior spine. This measurement was made at the end of a
normal expiration while the subject stood upright.
Handgrip strength
Muscular strength was measured with a Jamar handgrip
dynamometer (Lafayette Instruments, Lafayette, IN). After a
brief demonstration and verbal instructions, the test was per-
formed in the standing position with the wrist in the neutral
position and the elbow flexed to 90 degrees. Patients were given
verbal encouragement to squeeze as hard as possible and to
apply maximal effort for at least 3 seconds. Two trials were
allowed in the dominant limb, and the highest score was recorded
as peak grip strength (kg). Considering possible influences on the
muscular strength of changes in body composition, handgrip
strength (HG) was divided by appendicular lean mass (ALM)
determined by DXA (HG/ALM) and by appendicular soft lean
mass (ASLM) determined by MF-BIA (HG/ASLM).
Total body composition and selective visceral
fat-mass analysis
DXA
Total body mass
Total body composition was first measured by iDXA (GE
Healthcare Lunar, Madison, WI). Daily quality control scans were
acquired during the study period. No hardware or software
changes were made during the course of the trial. Subjects were
scanned using standard imaging and positioning protocols, while
wearing only light clothing. For the current study, bone mineral
density,leanbodymass,andFMvalues,whicharedirectlymeasured
by the GE Lunar Body Composition Software (GE Healthcare),
were used. Some derivative values, such as bone mineral content,
regional lean mass, ALM, FFM, and FM percentage (FM%), as
well as android and gynoid fat (%), were also calculated. The
android/gynoid ratio was automatically generated and analyzed
using enCORE software, version 13.6 (GE Healthcare). For
measuring android fat, a region of interest was automatically de-
fined as the caudal limit placed at the top of the iliac crest, and its
high was set to 20% of the distance from the top of the iliac crest to
the base of the skull to define the cephalic limit of abdominal
subcutaneous adipose tissue. The scanner was calibrated daily
against the calibration block supplied by the manufacturer.
Visceral fat mass
Visceral fat was calculated using a newly developed software
(Core Scan; GE Healthcare), which was validated against
computed tomography in a patient population with a wide
range of BMIs (19, 20). Visceral fat mass data from DXA were
transformed into adipose tissue volume using a constant cor-
rection factor (0.94 g/cm3).
MF-BIA
MF-BIA (InBody 720; Biospace, Tokyo, Japan) was also
used for determining body composition in terms of FM, FM%,
FFM, total body water, intra- and extracellular water, skeletal
muscle mass, and ASLM. This noninvasive technology employs
8 contact electrodes, which are positioned on the palm and
thumb of each hand and on the front part of the feet and on the
heels. In addition, MF-BIA uses the body’s electrical properties
and the opposition to the flow of an electric current by different
body tissues. The analyzer measured resistance at specific fre-
quencies (1, 5, 50, 250, 500, and 1000 kHz) and reactance at
specific frequencies (5, 50, and 250 kHz). The participants were
examined while lightly dressed, and the examination took less
than 2 minutes and required only a standing position. The val-
idity of this technology has been documented in previous studies
(21, 22). Visceral fat area values were also calculated in cm2 by
MF-BiA. Importantly, these values are significantly correlated
with those generated by computed tomography (22, 23). The
calculation of the different body compartments was performed
according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Biospace).
ADP
The last technique used to determine body composition in
the current study was ADP (BodPod; Life Measurements In-
struments, Concord, Canada), which is accepted as a convenient
alternative to the water immersion method for assessing body
composition. The standard BodPod protocol was followed (24),
and weekly quality control tests were performed during the
study period; a second calibration was conducted immediately
prior to the measurement of each participant. ADP determines
body volume using Boyle’s law of the pressure/volume re-
lationship. Therefore, body volume is equivalent to the decrease
of volume in the chamber with the entrance of the patient under
isothermal conditions. The participants were instructed to
wear a swimming suit tight to the body and a swim cap during
the test to diminish accumulated air and avoid volume dis-
crepancies. Thoracic gas volume was measured by connecting

 the subject to a breathing circuit. The process was repeated
until a consistent measurement was obtained. Body density was
calculated as mass divided by volume and corrected for lung
volume. The Siri formula was used to calculate FM, FM%, and
FFM (24, 25).
Determination of levels of ketone bodies
Ketosis was determined by measuring ketone bodies, spe-
cifically B-hydroxybutyrate (B-OHB), in capillary blood using a
portable meter (GlucoMen LX Sensor, A. Menarini Di-
agnostics, Neuss, Germany) before measurements of anthro-
pometric parameters. As with anthropometric assessments, all
of the determinations of capillary ketonemia were made after an
overnight fast of 8 to 10 hours. These measurements were
performed daily by each patient during the entire VLCK diet,
and the corresponding values were reviewed on the machine’s
memory by the research team for managing adherence. Addi-
tionally, B-OHB levels were determined at each complete visit
by the physician in charge of the patient. The measurements
reported as “low value” (# 0.2 mmol/L) by the meter were
assumed to be zero for purposes of statistical analyses.
Statistical analysis
The data are presented as mean (standard deviation). All
statistical analyses were carried out using Stata statistical
software, version 12.0 (Stata, College Station, TX). A P , 0.05
was considered statistically significant. Changes in the different
variables of interest from baseline and throughout the study
visits were analyzed following a repeated measures design. A
repeated measures analysis of variance test was used to evaluate
differences between different measurement times, followed by
post hoc analysis with Tukey’s adjustment for multiple com-
parisons. In addition, linear regression analyses were used to
evaluate the accuracy of MF-BIA and ADP in comparison with
DXA, because DXA is considered the reference technique in the
estimation of body composition in clinical research (26). Finally,
the Bland-Altman approach was also used to assess the accuracy
of MF-BIA and ADP against DXA in the estimation of FM%.

 Results
Baseline characteristics of participants
Initially, 23 participants were recruited into the study,
but 3 dropped out voluntarily during the first week of the
intervention for reasons unrelated to diet, and therefore
were excluded from analysis. The 20 patients who
completed the study exhibited the following baseline
characteristics: mean age, 47.2 6 10.2 years; BMI,
35.5 6 4.4; and waist circumference, 109.4 6 12.8 cm;
12 (60%) were women (Supplemental Table 1). Other
baseline characteristics and their corresponding changes
during the study are presented in Table 1.
Changes in anthropometric parameters and body
composition
Although the patients underwent a total of 10 visits,
the complete body composition analyses were synchro-
nized with the ketone levels in 4 visits (Table 1; Fig. 1).
Visit C-1 was the baseline visit, before starting the diet,
with no ketosis (0.0 6 0.1 mmol/L) and a body weight of
95.9 6 16.3 kg. Visit C-2 was at the time of maximum
level of ketosis (1.0 6 0.6 mmol/L) with a body weight of
84.2618.0kg.AtvisitC-3(after89.7619.1daysofVLCK),
patients began the return to a normal diet and showed a
reduction in ketone levels (0.7 6 0.5 mmol/L) and a body
weight of 76.6 6 11.1 kg. Finally, at visit C-4, the patients
were out of ketosis (0.2 6 0.1 mmol/L) and showed a body
weight of 75.1 6 11.8 kg. All weights were statistically dif-
ferent from baseline levels (P , 0.05; Table 1; Fig. 1).
The severe reduction in body weight was mainly a
result of FM reduction, as assessed by DXA scan; the
220.2 kg of weight reduction at the end of the study was
in large part due to the 216.5 kg reduction in FM. When
the FM compartment was assessed by MF-BIA, the result
was very similar (218.2 kg) and was further corrobo-
rated by the ADP analysis [217.7 kg; Fig. 2(A)], without
statistical differences among the results. It was remark-
able that 3 methods of evaluating body composition,
which operate through different principles, yielded such
similar results. FM loss represents nearly 85% of the total
weight loss achieved across the study.
Because visceral fat is physiologically and clinically
more relevant than total FM, special emphasis was placed
on its analysis. The VLCK diet led to a significant re-
duction in visceral fat that can be seen in assessment by
either new DXA software (21.2 6 0.7 kg) or by MF-BIA
[260.8 6 20.7 cm2; Fig. 2(B) and 2(C)]. Therefore, when
evaluated by different methods, the VLCK diet induced a
significant body weight reduction by targeting total FM
and visceral FM [Fig. 2(A–C)].
The concern regarding the possible loss in muscular
mass was addressed by a strict analysis of the FFM
component using DXA, MF-BIA, and ADP, and mild but
significant reductions in relation to baseline were ob-
served [Fig. 3(A)]. The greatest decrease in FFM occurred
at the visit of maximum ketosis (visit C-2), with partial
recovery thereafter [Fig. 3(A)]. The FFM losses de-
termined by the different techniques at this point
were 24.2 6 1.8 kg (DXA), 23.1 6 1.5 kg (MF-BIA),
and 23.7 6 7.6 kg (ADP). At the end of the study (visit C-4),
these FFM losses had diminished to 23.7 6 2.0 kg, 22.4 6
1.8 kg, and 23.0 6 8.0 kg, respectively.
By discriminating the components of the FFM as de-
termined by DXA, it was observed that these variations
were mainly due to changes in lean mass, whereas bone
mineral content remained unchanged from baseline
(0.003 6 0.066 kg at visit C-2; 20.018 6 0.066 kg at visit
C-3; and 20.028 6 0.066 kg at visit C-4; P . 0.05).
Given that DXA technique is unable to discriminate the
composition of lean mass, the question was raised as to
whether the observed reductions in lean mass were at the
expense of muscle mass or body water content. There-
fore, further analysis was performed by MF-BIA , which
is able to discriminate these 2 variables. Remarkably, the
measurements performed by MF-BIA showed that the
initial loss of FFM at visit C-2 (23.1 6 1.5 kg) was
mostly due to total body water loss (22.3 6 1.1 kg), both
intra- (21.5 6 0.7 kg) and extracellular [20.8 6 0.5 kg;
Fig. 3(B)], probably because of the intense diuresis that
occurs in the first phase of any VLCK diet. In subsequent
visits, a slight recovery of intra- and extracellular water
was observed, similar to the recovery observed with total

 FFM. This means that reductions attributable to muscle
mass were, depending on the method used, around 1 kg
throughout the 4-month study; only 5% of the total
20.2 kg of weight lost was FFM.
The observation that the VLCK diet severely reduced
FM while preserving muscle mass was reinforced by the
maintenance of its physiological action (i.e., muscle
strength). Despite a slight reduction in ALM and ASLM,
as determined by DXA and MF-BIA, respectively, crude
HG remained unchanged during the study (Table 1).
Moreover, HG/ALM and HG/ASLM showed a moderate
increase in comparison with baseline [Fig. 3(C)].
Estimation of body composition
among different methods
Finally, the accuracy of MF-BIA and
ADP in the estimation of body com-
position was studied in relation to
DXA. As shown in Table 2, the un-
adjusted regression coefficients for
FM, FM%, and FFM were consistently
higher with MF-BIA in comparison
with ADP throughout the study. Spe-
cifically, regression coefficients for
MF-BIA were high (r2 . 0.8) for FM
and FFM, whereas those regression
coefficients for FM% were slightly
lower (r2 . 0.7). However, most of the
regression coefficients using ADP were
lower (r 2 , 0.7) for FM, FM%, and
FFM. A similar pattern was observed
when adjusting for age and sex. The
regression coefficients for both MF-
BIA and ADP decreased with weight
loss.
The results of the Bland-Altman
approach in regard to the FM% are
shown in Fig. 4. MF-BIA under-
estimates the FM% during all visits,
although with increasing body fat there
is a trend toward better agreement [Fig.
4(A)]. This negative slope was signif-
icant in visits C2 (P = 0.015), C3
(P = 0.003), and C4 (P = 0.005). Im-
portantly, MF-BIA had a consistent
variability of about 5% in determining
FM% when compared with DXA.
However, the concordance between
DXA and ADP is shown in Fig. 4(B). In
visits C1 (P = 0.005), C2 (P = 0.010),
and C3 (P = 0.004) significant negative
slopes were observed, indicating un-
derestimation of ADP at lower levels
of FM%, but ADP seemed to over-
estimate FM% with increasing body fat. During visit
C-4, a similar pattern was observed, although the slope did
not reach statistical significance (P = 0.093). During all
visits there was a high variability in the FM% determined
by ADP, reaching values of up to 20% in comparison
with DXA.
Discussion
In this study, the effects on body composition and muscle
strength induced by a VLCK diet (PNK Method) in obese
patients during an intervention period of up to 4 months

 was determined. This work assessed body composition
during and after severe weight loss by using 3 different,
highly sophisticated, and widely validated techniques
(DXA, MF-BIA, and ADP), which allowed an accurate
evaluation of the body changes during dieting. The main
findings of the present work were: (1) there was signif-
icant weight loss throughout the entire study, which was
mostly explained by reductions in total FM and visceral
fat tissue; (2) there was a mild initial
loss of FFM followed by a partial
subsequent recovery of FFM, which
was principally a result of changes
in body water; (3) adequate muscle
strength was preserved during the
course of the diet; and (4) the less ex-
pensive and more convenient tech-
nique of MF-BIA showed an acceptable
agreement with DXA in estimating
body composition.
The VLCK diet was used because of
its ability to produce a rapid and well-
tolerated weight loss with a ketogenic
phase that lasts 60-90 days and a final
result of 20 kg of weight reduction at
4 months. The rapid reduction in
weight is the probable explanation of
the positive effects of this dieting ap-
proach, which are evident 1 and 2 years
later (12, 13). Four different stages
occurred with the VLCK diet used:
a basal stage with obese body weight
and no ketosis, a second stage with
extreme ketosis and marked body
weight loss, a third stage with body
weight loss and declining ketosis, and a
fourth stage with weight loss and no
ketosis. Body composition was studied
with the 3 techniques at each of these
stages.
The accurate measurement of body
composition changes is relevant to
assess the contribution of the diet in-
tervention, not only to total body
weight but to the changes produced
in FM, FFM, visceral fat tissue, and
total body water (25, 27). To obtain
such information, multicompartmental
models that integrate information ob-
tained from a single measurement
(body density, total mineral mass, total
body water) may be used to reduce the
number of assumptions made on the
stability of body characteristics (28).
These models are of limited application in clinical
practice, because they do not provide immediate results,
are expensive, and require advanced analytical expertise
(29, 30). For such reasons the 3 more widely used body
composition analysis techniques were used in the present
work. DXA is the most validated and commonly used
technique to analyze body composition in obese patients
and is based on the attenuation of a low-energy X-ray

 beam, depending on the tissue density and chemical
composition. DXA is considered the gold standard
technique by most groups working with body compo-
sition and was used as the reference method in the present
work. Bioelectrical impedance techniques are low cost
and readily available and rely on the use of population-
specific equations to assess intracellular and extracellular
water distribution. The MF-BIA system used in this study
is a recently developed version that is not based on sta-
tistical population data and is capable of accurately
assessing subjects with different body shapes and also
obese subjects. Finally, ADP measures body density and is
used more easily than other more complex systems for
measuring body density, such as underwater weighing,
and provides comparable results for obese subjects.
Therefore, the use of 3 validated methods that use dif-
ferent principles was relevant for evaluating patients in
different stages of a body weight reduction program.
Previous studies have shown that ketogenic diets
preferably reduce the total FM in obese patients (10–13).
However, the precise distribution of these losses has not
been determined. In this study we confirmed that the diet
reduces total FM and specifically visceral adipose tissue,
which has a greater impact in predicting cardiometabolic
complications associated with obesity than does the total
volume of body adiposity (2, 31).
However, maintaining muscle mass and its function-
ality (i.e., muscle strength) has an important role in
preventing weight regain, maintaining physical func-
tionality, improving cardiometabolic risk factors, and
reducing cardiovascular outcomes (5, 7–9, 32, 33). It is
commonly assumed, and stated in several textbooks on
obesity, that weight loss is associated with an important
loss of muscle mass that evolves in parallel with the fat
reduction. Some dietary guidelines have even suggested
that diets that induce rapid weight loss, such as VLCK
diets, create a greater energy deficit and contain lower
amounts of protein, and therefore increase the risk of
reductions in muscle mass compared with other in-
terventions with more gradual weight loss (34, 35). In this
article it was shown that the reductions observed in lean
mass were mostly a result of body water loss, both intra-
and extracellular. The combined information from the
DXA and MF-BIA methods allows for such differentiation
(28, 36–38). The loss attributable to muscle mass was
minimal (;1 kg), and an absolute preservation of HG
strength was observed, a remarkable fact considering that
the patients have experienced a weight reduction of ;20 kg.
Various mechanisms may explain the variations in
body water. For example, glycogen depletion induced by
VLCK diets could cause a marked increase in diuresis,
given that glycogen is usually stored together with water
(39, 40). Water loss might also be associated with
ketonuria, because ketone bodies increase the renal so-
dium and water loss as a result (39, 41). These as-
sumptions seem reasonable considering that the peak
water loss coincides with the phase of maximum ketosis.
However, the mechanisms explaining the diuresis ob-
served with VLCK and with most hypocaloric diets are
not known at present (30). Contrary to previous obser-
vations (42, 43), DXA analysis evidenced a maintenance
in bone mineral density in the current study.
Although in most clinical settings, BMI and waist
circumference are used because they are inexpensive and
convenient, it is evident that they are not able to precisely
determine excess fat mass and its loss during treatment

 (44). More precise techniques to assess body composition
are needed in specialized clinical settings and for research
purposes. Therefore, another target of this work was to
compare the accuracy of the information provided by the
more expensive and less convenient DXA, currently con-
sidered the gold standard, with the less expensive and more
convenient MF-BIA, as well as with ADP, which is only
used in highly specialized centers because of its high cost
(45). The results obtained showed that MF-BIA correlates
very well with DXA, although with a tendency to slightly
underestimate the FM%. These results are consistent with
previous work that found that MF-BIA may overestimate
the FFM, and thus produce an underestimation of the FM
and FM% (45). MF-BIA provided highly relevant in-
formation about the water component during dieting. On
the other hand, the ADP instrument showed a lower cor-
relation with DXA and a greater variability in estimating
the FM%. Compared with DXA, ADP underestimates the
FM% in thinner patients, and overestimates the FM% in
those patients with a higher body fat. The 3 techniques
correlated remarkably well, although the less expensive
MF-BIA performed with high precision.
An important strength of this study was the use of 3
different techniques for determining body composition in
different settings, i.e., obesity and no ketosis, marked
reduction in body weight with high ketosis, and finally,
substantial reduction in body weight without ketosis.
The tight control of adherence by daily measurement of
B-OHB is another relevant strength of this work. A
potential limitation of our study could be the sample size;
however, because each subject underwent 4 evaluations,
enabling each individual subject’s own results to be
compared, this adds statistical power to the study and a
real difference between the experimental points.
In conclusion, this study exhaustively assessed body
composition changes during the weight reduction process
induced by a VLCK diet. This assessment was performed
using 3 complementary techniques: DXA, MF-BIA, and
ADP. The VLCK diet induced a marked weight loss that
was achieved mainly at the expense of total FM, and also
visceral fat, with a maximum conservation of muscle
mass and muscle strength. Additionally, MF-BIA was
demonstrated to be an effective and convenient alter-
native for measuring body composition in clinical prac-
tice due to its minimal burden for the patient, ease of
operation, low cost, and high accuracy.
