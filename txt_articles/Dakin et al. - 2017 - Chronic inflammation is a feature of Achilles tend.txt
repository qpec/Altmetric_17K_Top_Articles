background Recent investigation of human tissue 
and cells from positional tendons such as the rotator 
cuff has clarified the importance of inflammation in the 
development and progression of tendon disease. These 
mechanisms remain poorly understood in disease of 
energy-storing tendons such as the Achilles. Using tissue 
biopsies from patients, we investigated if inflammation is 
a feature of Achilles tendinopathy and rupture.
Methods We studied Achilles tendon biopsies 
from symptomatic patients with either mid-portion 
tendinopathy or rupture for evidence of abnormal 
inflammatory signatures. Tendon-derived stromal cells 
from healthy hamstring and diseased Achilles were 
cultured to determine the effects of cytokine treatment 
on expression of inflammatory markers.
results Tendinopathic and ruptured Achilles highly 
expressed CD14+ and CD68+ cells and showed a 
complex inflammation signature, involving NF-κB, 
interferon and STAT-6 activation pathways. Interferon 
markers IRF1 and IRF5 were highly expressed in 
tendinopathic samples. Achilles ruptures showed 
increased PTGS2 and interleukin-8 expression. 
Tendinopathic and ruptured Achilles tissues expressed 
stromal fibroblast activation markers podoplanin and 
CD106. Tendon cells isolated from diseased Achilles 
showed increased expression of pro-inflammatory and 
stromal fibroblast activation markers after cytokine 
stimulation compared with healthy hamstring tendon 
cells.
Conclusions Tissue and cells derived from 
tendinopathic and ruptured Achilles tendons show 
evidence of chronic (non-resolving) inflammation. The 
energy-storing Achilles shares common cellular and 
molecular inflammatory mechanisms with functionally 
distinct rotator cuff positional tendons. Differences 
seen in the profile of ruptured Achilles are likely to 
be attributable to a superimposed phase of acute 
inflammation and neo-vascularisation. Strategies that 
target chronic inflammation are of potential therapeutic 
benefit for patients with Achilles tendon disease.
InTrOduCTIOn
Achilles tendon disorders including tendinopathy 
and rupture frequently cause pain and disability in 
athletes and non-athletic individuals.1 These injuries 
are difficult to treat, require prolonged rehabilita-
tion and have a high frequency of recurrence.2 3 The 
tendon mid-portion is the most frequently injured 
site3; entheseal disease at the calcaneal insertion 
is less common. Multiple factors contribute to 
the pathogenesis of tendon disease including the 
effects of exercise, overuse, genetic predisposition 
and ageing.4–7 While inflammatory mediators are 
known to contribute to the initiation and progres-
sion of tendon disease in the shoulder,8–11 the rela-
tive importance and role of inflammation is highly 
debated in energy-storing tendons such as the 
Achilles, where historically disease was frequently 
described as ‘degenerative’.12 
More recent studies have identified immune-com-
petent cells including macrophages, T cells, natural 
killer and mast cells in human biopsy specimens from 
non-ruptured chronic tendinopathic Achilles.13 
However, the phenotypes of these cells are yet to be 
fully characterised. Apoptosis pathways have also 
been described as an important signalling cascade 
implicated in the biology of Achilles tendinopathy.6 
These studies support the contribution of inflam-
mation in the pathogenesis of Achilles tendon 
disease, although the precise mechanisms remain to 
be elucidated. Of importance, the resident stromal 
fibroblast population that constitutes the major cell 
type in tendons remains under investigated.
Improved understanding of the cellular and 
molecular processes orchestrating inflammation in 
Achilles tendon disease is essential to identify ther-
apeutic targets that address the underlying disease 
biology. The mechanisms governing the develop-
ment of chronic inflammation that fails to resolve 
in persistently symptomatic patients is of particular 
interest. In the current study, we investigated the 
cellular and molecular features of inflammation 
in patient biopsy samples of tendinopathic and 
ruptured Achilles. We sought to identify if disease of 
energy-storing tendons such as the Achilles shared 
common inflammatory mechanisms to those previ-
ously identified in positional tendons such as the 
rotator cuff. We hypothesised that these function-
ally distinct tendons would share common inflam-
matory mechanisms.
resulTs
Clinical parameters for the study group 
Biopsies from patients with Achilles tendinopathy 
were collected from 7 female and 10 male patients 
aged 41–74 years (mean, 50.4±8.8 years) that 
presented for high-volume injection (HVI). VISA-A 
scores for patients with Achilles tendinopathy 
ranged from 25 to 77 (mean, 39.6±15.4). Mean 
body mass index (BMI) from the Achilles tendinop-
athy patient group was 29.9 (±6.1).
Tissue biopsy samples were collected from 4 
female and 15 male patients that presented to a 
trauma unit for surgical debridement of an Achilles

rupture (n=19). Patients with Achilles rupture were aged 20–67 
years (mean, 44.6±11.8 years). VISA-A scores were not avail-
able for patients with Achilles ruptures. BMI for the Achilles 
rupture patient group was (28.8±4).
Healthy hamstring (semitendinosis) tendons were collected 
from 5 female and 10 male patients aged 18–48 years (mean, 
25.5±11 years) during surgical anterior cruciate ligament recon-
struction. BMI from this healthy patient group was 24.9 (±2.1).
Tendinopathic and ruptured Achilles show a complex tissue 
inflammation signature and increased vascularity
Using immunohistochemistry, we identified increased expres-
sion of CD14+ and 
CD68+ cells in tendinopathic and ruptured 
Achilles (collectively grouped as diseased) compared with 
healthy hamstring tendons (P=0.0015 
and 0.0007, respec-
tively) (figure 1A). There was no significant difference in the 
numbers of CD14+ and 
CD68+ cells between tendinopathic 
and ruptured Achilles tendons. We further characterised the acti-
vation status of these immune cells in samples of tendinopathic 
and ruptured Achilles in situ. We used a previously validated 
panel of antibodies associated with macrophage activation, 
including proteins implicated in pro-inflammatory pathways 
(IRF5 and IRF1) and alternative macrophage activation (CD206 
and CD163).8 Diseased Achilles tendons showed a complex 
macrophage activation protein signature and expressed markers 
of interferon (IRF5, IRF1), STAT-6 (CD206) and glucocorti-
coid receptor (GCR) (CD163) macrophage activation pathways 
(figure 1B–D). In addition to characterising myeloid cells, we 
also investigated CD31 as a marker of vascularisation in samples 
of healthy hamstring, tendinopathic and ruptured Achilles 
(figure 1E). Quantitative analysis of immunopositive staining 
showed increased CD31 expression in tendinopathic (P=0.02) 
and ruptured Achilles (P=0.0002) relative to healthy hamstring 
tendons. Ruptures showed increased CD31 expression relative 
to samples of tendinopathic Achilles (P=0.0003) (figure 1E). 
Isotype control staining of corresponding tendon tissues is 
shown in online supplementary figure S1.
Having identified inflammatory proteins in tendinopathic and 
ruptured Achilles, we studied gene expression in these samples 
using a panel of markers implicated in macrophage activation.8 
In support of the protein signatures identified in these samples, 
diseased Achilles showed a complex inflammation gene signa-
ture with some differences between tendinopathic and ruptured 
samples (figure 2). CD163 messenger RNA (mRNA) was highly 
expressed by tendinopathic and ruptured Achilles (P=0.002 
and 
0.03, respectively) compared with healthy hamstring tendons. 
CD206 mRNA was increased in tendinopathic compared with 
ruptured Achilles (P=0.0002). Tendinopathic Achilles highly 
expressed interferon target genes including IRF1, IRF5 and 
CXCL10 compared with ruptured and healthy tendons. ALOX15 
implicated in resolving inflammation was decreased in tend-
inopathic compared with healthy tendons (P=0.04). Ruptures 
showed increased IL-8 and PTGS2 compared with tendinopathic 
Achilles (P=0.0003 
and 0.03, respectively).
diseased Achilles tendon tissues express markers of stromal 
fibroblast activation
Having focused on characterising the phenotypes of myeloid 
cells populating diseased Achilles, we investigated if resident 
tendon cells in these samples also possessed a pro-inflammatory 
phenotype. Stromal fibroblast activation (SFA) markers including 
podoplanin (PDPN), CD106 and CD248 have not been identi-
fied in diseased Achilles tendons. We found that PDPN mRNA 
was increased in tendinopathic (P=0.04) and ruptured Achilles 
(P=0.01) compared with healthy hamstring tendon tissues 
(figure 3A). CD106 mRNA was also increased in tendinopathic 
(P=0.004) and ruptured Achilles (P=0.04) compared with 
healthy hamstring. CD248 mRNA was increased in tendino-
pathic Achilles compared with healthy hamstring (P=0.008). 
Immunostaining supported increased expression of SFA markers 
and pro-inflammatory marker toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) in 
sections of tendinopathic and ruptured Achilles compared with 
healthy hamstring tendons (figure 3B–D). In diseased Achilles 
tendons, PDPN, CD106 and CD248 colocalised with TLR4.
diseased Achilles-tendon-derived stromal cells are primed for 
inflammation
Markers of inflammatory pathways and fibroblast activation 
detected in tendinopathic/ruptured Achilles tissues were subse-
quently studied in vitro to compare the effects of cytokine treat-
ment on tendon-derived stromal cells isolated from healthy 
hamstring and diseased tendinopathic and ruptured Achilles 
tendons. PDPN protein was increased in cells isolated from tend-
inopathic and ruptured Achilles relative to healthy hamstring 
under unstimulated conditions (P=0.01 
and P=0.004, 
respec-
tively) (figure 4A). Stimulation with IL-1β for 24 
hours further 
induced PDPN in healthy and diseased tendon cells. IL-1β-stim-
ulated tendinopathic and ruptured Achilles showed profound 
induction of PDPN relative to respective healthy tendon cells 
(P=0.04 
and 0.004, respectively) (figure 4A). Similar obser-
vations were made when PDPN mRNA expression was deter-
mined after IL-1β stimulation of healthy and diseased tendon 
cells (figure 4B). IRF5 mRNA was increased in cells isolated 
from tendinopathic Achilles relative to healthy hamstring under 
unstimulated conditions (P=0.026) (figure 4C). IFNγ treatment 
induced expression of interferon target genes in tendon cells 
isolated from healthy hamstring and diseased Achilles. IFNγ 
treatment markedly induced IRF5 mRNA in cells isolated from 
tendinopathic and ruptured Achilles compared with healthy 
hamstring (P=0.016 
and 0.026, respectively) (figure 4C). The 
same treatment also induced IRF1 mRNA in cells isolated from 
tendinopathic and ruptured Achilles compared with healthy 
hamstring (P=0.04) (figure 4D).
dIsCussIOn
The role of inflammation in the aetiopathogenesis of tendon 
disease is a subject of ongoing debate. During the past 20 
years, tendon disease has been characterised as a ‘degenerative’ 
process devoid of inflammation. Recently, this paradigm has 
been challenged, suggesting that it may disregard a complex role 
for inflammation in tendon disease. Coupled with improved 
scientific methodologies and collection of well-phenotyped 
patient biopsy material, our understanding of tendon inflam-
matory processes has advanced in recent years. Recent studies 
have improved understanding of the phenotypes of immune 
cells identified in biopsy samples of diseased human tendons.8 
Other work has also identified that resident stromal fibroblasts 
from diseased human tendons show a pro-inflammatory pheno-
type,11 illustrating that non-immune cells are also implicated in 
tendon inflammatory processes. Understanding the phenotypes 
of immune cells and tendon stromal populations is critical to 
advancing knowledge of inflammation in the pathobiology of 
Achilles tendon disease.
The present study investigated the cellular and molecular 
features of inflammation in diseased Achilles tendons. Using 
tissues derived from well-phenotyped patient cohorts, we

identified that inflammation is a feature of both mid-portion 
Achilles tendinopathy and rupture. The pathways determining 
activation of macrophages to be classified as M1 or M2 pheno-
types have recently been revised to reflect the key signalling 
pathways and receptors in distinct activation pathways. These 
include pro-inflammatory interferon and NF-κB pathways, the 
pro-fibrotic STAT-6 pathway and GCR activation pathway.14 
We investigated expression of target molecules from each of 
these pathways in healthy hamstring and diseased Achilles 
tendon tissues. Tissue samples from Achilles patient cohorts 
showed a complex inflammation signature, expressing target 
molecules from interferon, NF-κB, STAT-6 and GCR acti-
vation pathways. Both tendinopathic and ruptured Achilles 
tendons expressed CD206 and CD163, suggestive of estab-
lished (chronic) inflammation and tissue repair. We identified 
some differences in the inflammatory profiles depending on

6 (CD206) and glucocorticoid receptor activation pathways (CD163). The inflammation signature of diseased Achilles tendons was compared with

the type of disease. Tendinopathic Achilles showed increased 
expression of interferon target genes and proteins including 
IRF1, IRF5 and CXCL10. We previously identified that an 
interferon signature similar to that found in tendinopathic 
Achilles tendons was a feature of tissue biopsies from tendi-
nopathic rotator cuff.8 In contrast, ruptured Achilles tendons 
highly expressed NF-κB target genes PTGS2 and IL-8 and 
showed increased vascularity. Genes associated with angio-
genesis including vascular endothelial growth factor have been 
identified in samples of diseased Achilles tendons.15 Further-
more, IL-8 is a significant promoter of angiogenesis.16 This 
NFκB signature of Achilles tendon ruptures was not a feature 
of tissue samples collected from patients with large-massive 
rotator cuff tendon tears.8 Table 1 summarises the comparative 
features of disease in functionally distinct tendons such as the 
Achilles and rotator cuff. While patients with Achilles rupture 
may have had pre-existing tendon disease prior to rupture, 
the timing of tissue collection relative to an acute event such 
as tendon rupture is an important factor in the interpretation 
of these findings. The differences in inflammation signature 
between torn Achilles and rotator cuff tendons are likely attrib-
utable to the consequences of recent trauma and earlier clin-
ical presentation of patients with Achilles rupture. Conversely, 
symptom duration and subsequent surgical repair is frequently 
more protracted (months to years) in patients with rotator cuff 
tendon tears (table 1). This phase of acute inflammation and 
neo-angiogenesis may partly explain the higher success rate 
of repair of Achilles tendon ruptures compared with repair of 
torn rotator cuff tendons.17

Having characterised the phenotypes of myeloid cells in 
diseased Achilles tissues, we next investigated the pheno-
type of resident tendon stromal fibroblasts, (tenocytes) in 
tissues and cells derived from these patient cohorts. We previ-
ously identified that tissues and cells isolated from diseased 
shoulder tendons highly expressed SFA markers, suggestive 
of a sustained change in their phenotype as a consequence of 
exposure to inflammation.11 To our knowledge, the pheno-
type of fibroblasts populating diseased Achilles tendons has 
not been described. We discovered that tissue samples from 
patients with Achilles tendinopathy and rupture also highly 
expressed PDPN, CD106 and CD248. A recent study inves-
tigating inflammation in cultured stromal fibroblasts isolated 
from torn rotator cuff tendons identified that diseased tendon 
cells were ‘primed’ for inflammation.8 In the present study, we 
investigated if cells isolated from patients with disease of func-
tionally distinct Achilles tendons were similarly ‘primed’. IL-1β 
or IFNγ stimulation of healthy and diseased tendon stromal 
cells induced expression of respective target genes compared 
with untreated control cells. Notably, cytokine-treated tendon 
stromal cells from diseased Achilles showed profound induc-
tion of PDPN and inflammatory proteins IRF1 and IRF5 
compared with healthy hamstring tendon stromal cells. 
Collectively, our data support the concept that tissues and cells 
from diseased Achilles tendons undergo phenotypic change 
and may become ‘primed’ after exposure to inflammation. 
The cellular and molecular features of chronic inflammation 
common to functionally distinct tendons are summarised in 
figure 5, whereby impaired resolution of inflammation and 
failure to clear apoptotic cells sustains chronic inflammation 
and fibrosis. Conversely, with successful resolution, expression 
of pro-inflammatory mediators is moderated, although some 
degree of SFA persists.8 11 This stromal ‘memory’ may sensitise 
tendon stromal cells and increase susceptibility to further 
episodes of inflammation and recurrent tendon disease.
There are potential limitations of using hamstring tendon 
as a comparator to diseased Achilles, including differences 
in donor age and tendon type. However, hamstring tendons 
were collected from healthy donors without history of tendi-
nopathy. This is preferable to using cadaveric Achilles tendon 
tissues, where the tissues can be affected by postmortem change 
and little is known about the health status of the tissue. In 
addition, as sex distribution was not evenly matched between 
Achilles tissue cohorts, it was necessary to pool data for men 
and women.
The findings from our study demonstrate that tissues from 
patients with tendinopathic and ruptured Achilles tendons both 
show evidence of chronic inflammation. Moreover, function-
ally distinct tendons such as the Achilles and rotator cuff share 
common cellular and molecular features. We identify slight 
differences in pro-inflammatory profiles between tendinopathic 
and ruptured Achilles tendons and suggest that this difference is 
attributable to superimposed acute inflammation and increased 
vascularisation, occurring after recent Achilles tendon rupture. 
We propose that treatment strategies that target non-resolving 
inflammation are of potential therapeutic benefit for patients 
with Achilles tendon disease.

study design
The study objective was to investigate the cellular and molec-
ular features of inflammation in Achilles tendon disease. Tissue 
samples were collected from patient cohorts with mid-portion 
Achilles tendinopathy or rupture. We investigated tissue inflam-
mation signatures in these patient cohorts compared with healthy 
Figure 5 Schematic summarising the cellular and molecular features of chronic inflammation identified from cross-sectional assessments of 
functionally distinct tendons. Macrophages in diseased tendons show a mixed signature and express pro-inflammatory macrophage markers (IRF1, 
IRF5) and markers of alternative macrophage activation including CD206 and CD163. After exposure to inflammatory stimuli, diseased tendon 
cells become ‘primed’ and express markers of stromal fibroblast activation including PDPN and adopt a more rounded morphology, reflecting a 
phenotypic shift in their inflammatory profile. Other pro-inflammatory molecules expressed by tendon cells include damage-associated molecular 
pattern TLR4, IRF1 and IRF5. Achilles tendon ruptures show increased vascularity and highly express interleukin-8 and PTGS2. Chronic inflammation 
and fibrosis develop due to impaired resolution of inflammation and failure of clearance of apoptotic cells. With successful resolution, expression of 
pro-inflammatory mediators is moderated, although some degree of stromal fibroblast activation persists. This stromal ‘memory’ may sensitise tendon 
cells and increase susceptibility to further episodes of inflammation and recurrent tendon disease. PDPN, podoplanin; TLR4, toll-like receptor 4.

hamstring tendons. Inflammatory pathways were subsequently 
investigated in cultured stromal fibroblasts derived from healthy 
and diseased tendons. Sample size justification was derived from 
previous studies that were sufficiently powered to study inflam-
mation in diseased tendon tissues and cells.8 11 For histology and 
immunostaining, a single-blinded investigator acquired images. 
Sample sizes and experimental replicates are outlined in figure 
legends.
Collection of tendon tissues
Patients with Achilles tendinopathy were recruited from a 
sports medicine clinic (n=17). Patients presenting to the 
sports clinic had been symptomatic for months and failed a 
standard 3-month eccentric training programme for Achilles 
tendinopathy. Ultrasonography was performed to confirm the 
presence of Achilles tendinopathy and suitability for HVI for 
patients who have failed conservative management, as this 
procedure represents the next step in standard treatment. 
Patients completed the VISA-A scoring system,18 a validated 
clinical outcome measure scoring from 0 (severe disease) to 
100 (normal function). Achilles tendon biopsies were collected 
from patients that presented for HVI. This procedure involves 
injecting 10 mL 0.5% bupivicaine and 30 mL saline into the 
pre-Achilles space. Achilles tendon biopsies were obtained 
via percutaneous ultrasound-guided biopsy under local anaes-
thesia prior to HVI at the site of ultrasonographic abnor-
mality. The specimen was collected using a 14G trucut biopsy 
needle inserted into the diseased mid-portion of the Achilles. 
This validated biopsy technique is adapted from a previously 
described protocol.19
Patients with Achilles tendon rupture were recruited from a 
trauma unit (n=19). Tissue biopsy samples of Achilles tendon 
ruptures were collected between 36 and 48 hours after tendon 
rupture. Full informed consent according to the Declaration 
of Helsinki was obtained from all patients participating in 
the study. Exclusion criteria included previous intratendinous 
corticosteroid/platelet-rich plasma/stem cell injection, extra-
corporeal shockwave therapy or systemic steroid or meth-
otrexate treatments. Diabetic patients and those receiving 
systemic anticoagulant therapy were also excluded from the 
study.
Healthy hamstring (semitendinosis) tendons were collected 
from 15 patients undergoing surgical anterior cruciate ligament 
reconstruction.
Tendon tissue sample processing
Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence
Tendon tissues were fixed in 10% formalin, processed using a 
Leica ASP300S tissue processor and embedded in paraffin wax. 
Tissues were sectioned at 6 
µm using a rotary RM2135 micro-
tome (Leica Microsystems) onto glass slides.
Gene expression
Healthy hamstring and diseased Achilles tendon tissue samples 
were snap-frozen in liquid N2 and stored at −80°C until RNA 
extraction.
Immunostaining for markers of macrophages and sFA
Antigen retrieval and single-staining immunohistochemistry for 
CD14 and CD68 were performed using previously published 
protocols.8 For multiplex immunofluorescence staining and 
image acquisition, protocols were adapted from Dakin et al8 
using primary antibodies listed in online supplementary table 1. 
Isotype controls were mouse IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b, IgG3 and IgM 
and rabbit immunoglobulin (Dako) ready-to-use antibodies 
(online supplementary figure S1). Images from stained sections 
were captured using a Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope using 
previously a published protocol.8
Cytokine treatment of tendon-derived stromal cells
IL-1β and IFNγ respectively induce NF-κB and IFN target genes 
expressed in diseased shoulder tendon tissues8 11 and were also 
identified in diseased Achilles tendon tissues in the current study. 
We therefore investigated if treatment of cultured tendon cells 
with these cytokines induced more profound expression of SFA 
markers and NF-κB and IFN target genes in diseased relative 
to healthy tendon-derived cells. Tendon-derived cells were 
isolated from healthy hamstring and diseased Achilles tendons 
using previously described protocols11; passage 1–3 cells were 
used for all experiments. Cells were grown until 80% conflu-
ence prior to stimulation with IL-1β (10 ng/mL, Sigma) or 
IFN gamma (20 ng/mL, BioLegend) in medium (DMEM F12, 
Lonza) containing 1% heat-inactivated human serum (Sigma). 
Non-treated (vehicle only) cells served as experimental controls. 
After cytokine/vehicle treatment, cells were incubated at 37°C 
and 5% CO2 for 24 
hours until experimental harvest for mRNA 
or flow cytometry.
rnA extraction from tendons
Protocols for RNA extraction, complementary DNA synthesis 
and quantitative PCR are described elsewhere.8 Validated 
human primers are listed in online supplementary table 2. 
Reactions were run in duplicate for each gene on a ViiA7 qPCR 
machine (Applied Biosystems). Results were calculated using 
the DDCt method using reference genes for human β-actin 
and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Results were 
consistent using these reference genes, and data shown are 
normalised to β-actin.
Flow cytometry of tendon-derived stromal cells
Flow cytometry was performed as previously described using 
a BD LSR Fortessa instrument.11 Antibody and isotype cock-
tails were prepared as listed in online supplementary table 3. 
Data analysis was performed using FlowJo software (Tree-
star); tendon cell populations were gated on CD45− and 
CD34− cells.
statistical analysis
GraphPad Prism 6 (GraphPad Software) was used to perform 
statistical analysis. Normality was tested using the Shap-
iro-Wilk normality test. Pairwise Mann-Whitney U tests were 
used to test for differences in expression of CD14 and CD68 in 
healthy and diseased tendons. Kruskal-Wallis tests followed by 
pairwise post hoc Mann-Whitney U tests were used to compare 
What are the findings?
 
► Chronic inflammation is a feature of both mid-portion Achilles 
tendinopathy and rupture.
 
► Pro-inflammatory profiles differ slightly in ruptured tendons; 
this is likely to be due to acute inflammation and increased 
vascularisation resulting from recent trauma.
 
► Although the Achilles and rotator cuff tendons are 
functionally distinct, they share common cellular and 
molecular inflammatory disease mechanisms.

Original article
mRNA expression of macrophage and SFA genes in healthy 
hamstring and in diseased tendinopathic and ruptured Achilles 
tendons. Pairwise Mann-Whitney U tests were used to deter-
mine differences between mRNA expression of macrophage 
and SFA target genes in cytokine-treated healthy and diseased 
tendon cells. Statistical significance was set at P<0.05.

how might it impact on clinical practice in the future?
 
► Therapeutic strategies must address the underlying biology of 
Achilles tendon disease if treatment is to be successful.
 
► Strategies that target inflammation are of potential 
therapeutic benefit for patients with chronic Achilles tendon 
disease.
 
► New therapeutic approaches are required to promote 
resolution of inflammation in chronic tendinopathy.
