IMPORTANCE Chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency (CCSVI) is characterized by
restricted venous outflow from the brain and spinal cord. Whether this condition is associated
with multiple sclerosis (MS) and whether venous percutaneous transluminal angioplasty
(PTA) is beneficial in persons with MS and CCSVI is controversial.
OBJECTIVE To determine the efficacy and safety of venous PTA in patients with MS and CCSVI.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS We analyzed 177 patients with relapsing-remitting MS;
62 were ineligible, including 47 (26.6%) who did not have CCSVI on color Doppler
ultrasonography screening. A total of 115 patients were recruited in the study timeframe. All
patients underwent a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled, parallel-group trial in 6 MS
centers in Italy. The trial began in August 2012 and concluded in March 2016; data were
analyzed from April 2016 to September 2016. The analysis was intention to treat.
INTERVENTIONS Patients were randomly allocated (2:1) to either venous PTA or catheter
venography without venous angioplasty (sham).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Two primary end points were assessed at 12 months:
(1) a composite functional measure (ie, walking control, balance, manual dexterity, postvoid
residual urine volume, and visual acuity) and (2) a measure of new combined brain lesions on
magnetic resonance imaging, including the proportion of lesion-free patients. Combined
lesions included T1 gadolinium-enhancing lesions plus new or enlarged T2 lesions.
RESULTS Of the included 115 patients with relapsing-remitting MS, 76 were allocated to the
PTA group (45 female [59%]; mean [SD] age, 40.0 [10.3] years) and 39 to the sham group
(29 female [74%]; mean [SD] age, 37.5 [10.6] years); 112 (97.4%) completed follow-up.
No serious adverse events occurred. Flow restoration was achieved in 38 of 71 patients (54%)
in the PTA group. The functional composite measure did not differ between the PTA and
sham groups (41.7% vs 48.7%; odds ratio, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.34-1.68; P = .49). The mean (SD)
number of combined lesions on magnetic resonance imaging at 6 to 12 months were 0.47
(1.19) in the PTA group vs 1.27 (2.65) in the sham group (mean ratio, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.15-0.91;
P = .03: adjusted P = .09) and were 1.40 (4.21) in the PTA group vs 1.95 (3.73) in the sham
group at 0 to 12 months (mean ratio, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.32-1.63; P = .45; adjusted P = .45). At
follow-up after 6 to 12 months, 58 of 70 patients (83%) in the PTA group and 22 of 33 (67%)
in the sham group were free of new lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (odds ratio, 2.64;
95% CI, 1.11-6.28; P = .03; adjusted P = .09). At 0 to 12 months, 46 of 73 patients (63.0%) in
the PTA group and 18 of 37 (49%) in the sham group were free of new lesions on magnetic
resonance imaging (odds ratio, 1.80; 95% CI, 0.81-4.01; P = .15; adjusted P = .30).
CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE Venous PTA has proven to be a safe but largely ineffective
technique; the treatment cannot be recommended in patients with MS.

hen intraluminal defects, compression, or hypopla-
sia are identified in the internal jugular or azygos
veins, the condition is known as chronic cerebro-
spinal venous insufficiency (CCSVI).1,2 An Italian open-label
study3 published in 2009 including 65 patients with multiple
sclerosis(MS)foundanassociationbetweenMSandCCSVI.The
study also found that venous percutaneous transluminal
angioplasty (PTA) was associated with an improved Multiple
Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC) score at 1 year in pa-
tients with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) and a reduction in
the proportion of those with gadolinium-enhancing lesions on
brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This preliminary
study attracted considerable media attention in Italy and else-
where; media-based groups formed to promote the treat-
ment, and some called to make it freely available.4
Subsequent to the initial reports by Zamboni et al,3 preva-
lence studies of CCSVI in MS have reported conflicting
results. A small 2012 case-control study5 further assessed the
potential of venous PTA to benefit patients with MS. One year
after venous PTA, the study found that functional score was
improved compared with baseline, and the authors sug-
gested that a double-blind randomized trial was justified.5
Both the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence
and the Italian Ministry of Health have urged that randomized
clinical trials be conducted to assess the efficacy of venous PTA
for CCSVI in MS.6,7 In response to these calls and to public pres-
sure, the Directorate-General for Health and Welfare of the
Italian Region of Emilia Romagna funded the Brain Venous
Drainage Exploited Against Multiple Sclerosis (Brave Dreams)
trial to investigate the efficacy and safety of venous PTA in
patients with MS and CCSVI. We report the results of that trial.
Methods
Study Design
TheBraveDreamstrialwasamulticenter,randomized,double-
blind, sham-controlled, parallel-group trial to evaluate the ef-
ficacy and safety of venous PTA in patients with MS and CCSVI
in extracranial or extravertebral veins. The study was con-
ducted at 6 MS centers in Italy and their associated color
Doppler ultrasonography (ECD) and angiography units, all of
which were accredited by the Italian National Health Service.
TheBraveDreamssteeringcommitteeappointedanEndPoints
Commission, which issued a detailed operations manual and
trained trial physicians (who assessed primary functional out-
comes, operated the ECD equipment, and performed cath-
etervenographywithoutvenousangioplastyandvenousPTA).
Aftertraining,thecommissionissuedanaccreditationthatwas
necessary for physicians to participate in the trial. Study moni-
toring was delegated to the company Medical Trials Analysis
Italy in Ferrara, Italy. A trial data coordinating center was
established to oversee data collection and quality and to
perform the statistical analyses. The study adhered to the
Helsinki Declaration and the International Council for
Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuti-
cals for Human Use Good Clinical Practice guidelines and was
approved by the ethical committee of the University of
Ferrara Hospital and subsequently by the ethical committees
of the other participating centers. The trial protocol has been
published.8 The trial protocol can be found in Supplement 1.
All participants provided written informed consent.
Participants
Patients were recruited at the participating centers. Eligibil-
ity criteria included age 18 to 65 years; a diagnosis of RRMS,
according to the 2005 McDonald criteria9; a diagnosis of sec-
ondary progressive MS, according to Lublin and Reingold10;
care provided by the recruiting center for at least 2 years; at
least1relapseinRRMSinthe2yearspriortoenrollment;abase-
line Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score of 2 to 5.511;
a disease duration of 15 years or less at baseline; stable neu-
rological condition without relapse for at least 30 days before
baseline; CCSVI, as determined by ECD examination carried
out in accordance with a screening protocol12; and not receiv-
ing MS-specific treatment, immunomodulating, or immuno-
suppressive therapy without changes for at least 6 months
up to baseline. Patients were ineligible if they had previous
venous PTA or had received fingolimod therapy, cladribine
therapy, laquinimod therapy, botulinum toxin therapy, infu-
sion pump or neurostimulator implantation, or had partici-
patedinanyclinicaltrialwithin3monthsofbaseline.Thecom-
plete list of exclusion criteria was published previously.8
Randomization and Blinding
The data coordinating center set up an internet-based com-
puterized central randomization protocol stratified by partici-
pating center with variable length blocks, which assigned pa-
tients to the PTA or sham group in a 2:1 ratio. Treatment
assignment was made known to the treating surgeon (via the
electronic case report form) only on the day of the operation.
Patients, all other study investigators, and operating room and
hospital personnel were blinded to assignment.
To maintain patient blinding, surgeons were trained to
deliver a catheter venography intervention that simulated
venous PTA.8 This involved sudden acceleration of the cath-
eter as it passed through the internal jugular vein together with
a comment from the radiologist suggesting that venous PTA
had been performed.
Key Points
Question What is the efficacy of venous percutaneous
transluminal angioplasty (PTA) for chronic cerebrospinal venous
insufficiency in patients with multiple sclerosis?
Findings In the Brave Dreams trial, which included 115 patients
with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, venous PTA did not
increase the proportion of patients who improved functionally nor
did it reduce the mean number of new combined brain lesions on
magnetic resonance imaging at 12 months. However, there was a
tendency for more patients to become free of new lesions after
venous PTA mainly because of a reduction in new lesions
appearing 6 to 12 months after randomization.
Meaning Venous PTA cannot be recommended for patients with
relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.

 Procedures
Participants underwent catheter venography without ve-
nous angioplasty of the azygos and internal jugular veins, with
percutaneous access via the left femoral vein. The presence
and location of CCSVI was assessed as reported elsewhere.2,3,5
If venography was positive for CCSVI, participants random-
ized to the PTA group received venous PTA during the venog-
raphy session. If CCSVI was absent, those assigned to the PTA
group received catheter venography without venous angio-
plasty. Those allocated to the sham group received catheter
venography without venous angioplasty. These procedures
were performed via day surgery. Overnight hospital stay was
never required in this trial. All patients received prophylactic
low-molecular-weight heparin during the 3 subsequent weeks.
Outcomes
There were 2 primary end points at 12 months: a functional
end point and an MRI end point.

urine volume and visual acuity.15 Based on the changes found,
each index was considered improved, stable, or worsened.

take place up to 15 months after venography.
Magnetic Resonance Imaging End Point
Scans were acquired at baseline and at 6 and 12 months after
venography. The primary MRI end point was the number of
new combined cerebral lesions at 12 months compared with
baseline. New combined lesions included (1) new lesions on
T2-weightedimages,(2)preexistinglesionsenlargedbygreater
than 30% on T2-weighted images, and (3) gadolinium-
enhancing lesions in T1-weighted images of preexisting
lesions. An additional MRI end point was the proportion of pa-
tients free of new lesions. Before starting the study, each cen-
ter acquired a set of MRI scans of a single individual on 2 sepa-
rate occasions. The scans were assessed by the Department
of Neurosciences at the University of Florence for image qual-
ity, repositioning accuracy, and signal-to-noise ratio to check
that quality was sufficient. At each center, MRIs were always
performed with the same device (at least 1.5 T) and with the
same protocol. The scans were assessed by an experienced
specialist blinded to treatment assignment.
Secondary Outcomes
Secondary outcomes at 12 months were the proportion of
patients with CCSVI diagnosed by ECD but not confirmed by
venography,annualizedrelapserate,changeinEDSSscore,pro-
portion of patients with relapses, and proportion of patients
who had venous PTA with restored flow on ECD at 12 months.
Safety
The types and grade of adverse events are reported according
to the Good Clinical Practice guidelines. Stopping rules in-
cluded serious adverse events and/or a false-positive rate for
CCSVI on ECD exceeding 10%.8
Statistical Analysis
To achieve a 90% power (SD = 7.6) to detect a hypothesized
2.1 fewer active MRI lesions in the PTA group (3.9 vs 6.0), 423
patients with RRMS were needed. This number of patients was
also sufficient (92% power) to detect a hypothesized 15% more
patients in the PTA group than the sham group improving on
the functional end point (α = .05; 2-sided test on propor-
tions). Patients in the sham group were themselves expected
to improve by 15% over the year of follow-up. Because both
primary end points were used to characterize treatment ben-
efit, each null hypothesis had to be rejected at the same sig-
nificance level (α = .05), with multiplicity adjustment only for
the MRI end point, since this had 2 parameters (mean lesion
number and proportion of lesion-free patients).16
Becauseoflowenrollment(6patientspermonthbyNovem-
ber 2013), the protocol was amended in February 2014; 300 pa-
tientswithRRMS(200inPTAgroupand100inshamgroup)were

Relapse rates (secondary end point) in the 2 groups were
compared assuming a Poisson distribution of events. Differ-
ences in EDSS scores at 1 year were compared by analysis of
covariance testing, with adjustment for baseline scores. When
analyzing components of the functional and MRI end points
(including findings at 0 to 6 and 6 to 12 months), we adjusted
for multiplicity using the Hommel method,17 since it is rea-
sonable to assume that variables involved could be directly re-
lated(reportedasadjustedPvalue).Alltestswere2-tailed,with
the significance level set at P < .05. Analyses were performed
with SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute) and R version 3.2 (R Foun-
dation for Statistical Computing).
Results
The Figure shows the study flowchart for patients with RRMS.
A total of 177 were assessed for eligibility, and 62 were ineli-
gible, including 47 (26.6%) who did not have CCSVI on ECD
screening. One hundred fifteen patients were eligible and ran-
domly assigned to the PTA group (n = 76) or the sham group
(n = 39), which included catheter venography without venous
angioplasty, between August 7, 2012, and December 15, 2014.

 the functional end point—a difference of −7% (95% CI, −26.7
to 10.1) in favor of the sham group. The logistic model ad-
justed for sex and disease duration provided an odds ratio (OR)
for improvement in the PTA group (compared with the sham
group) of 0.70 (95% CI, 0.31-1.59; P = .40). The OR for the un-
adjusted model was 0.75 (95% CI, 0.34-1.68; P = .49). Wors-
ening occurred in 9 patients (12%) in the PTA group vs 7 (19%)
in the sham group; functional stability was maintained in 17
(23%)inthePTAgroupand8(22%)intheshamgroup.Amixed
outcome (improvement in one or more functions and wors-
ening in one or more) occurred in 16 patients (22%) in the PTA
group and 4 (11%) in the sham group. Results for individual
components of the functional end point are shown in Table 3.
More patients in the PTA group than in the sham group im-
proved in visual acuity and manual dexterity, while more pa-
tients in the PTA group worsened for postvoid residual urine
volume and balance. Walking control remained stable in most
patients of both groups.
The number of new lesions on MRI at 12 months com-
pared with baseline was unrelated to venous PTA; there were
a mean 1.40 new lesions in the PTA group vs 1.95 in the sham
group (mean ratio, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.32-1.63; P = .45; adjusted
P = .45) (Table 2). In the regression analysis adjusted for sex
and disease duration, the mean PTA-to-sham ratio was 0.50
(95% CI, 0.20-1.27; P = .30). The proportion of patients free of
new lesions did not differ significantly between the PTA and
sham groups (63.0% vs 48.6%; OR, 1.80; 95% CI, 0.81-4.00;
P = .15; adjusted P = .30) (Table 2). At 12 months, 50 patients
(68%) in the PTA group were free of new or enlarged T2 le-
sionscomparedwith21(57%)intheshamgroup(OR,1.66;95%
CI, 0.73-3.75; P = .22; adjusted P = .62), and 53 (73%) in the PTA
group were free of gadolinium-enhancing lesions at 12 months
compared with 18 (49%) in the sham group (OR, 2.76; 95% CI,
1.14-6.68; P = .02; adjusted P = .08) (Table 4).
A post hoc analysis investigating new brain lesions at 0 to
6months(eTable1inSupplement2)andat6to12monthsfound
that at 6 to 12 months, 58 of 70 patients (83%) in the PTA group
and 22 of 33 (67%) in the sham group (OR, 2.64; 95% CI, 1.11-
6.28; P = .03; adjusted P = .09) were free of combined brain le-
sions, while there were a mean (SD) 0.36 (0.98) new T2 lesions
in the PTA group and 1.14 (2.63) in the sham group (P = .02; ad-
justed P = .06). Finally, 61 patients (87%) in the PTA group and
24(73%)intheshamgroup(OR,2.75;95%CI,1.10-6.89;P = .03;
adjusted P = .09) were free of new T2 lesions (Table 4).
Secondary End Points
Eight of 115 patients with RRMS (7.0%) diagnosed as having
CCSVIbyECDhadnoabnormalitiesonvenography,sotheposi-
tive predictive value of ECD was 93.0% in patients with RRMS.
The annualized relapse rate was 0.32 (95% CI, 0.2-0.4) in the
PTA group and 0.39 (95% CI, 0.2-0.5) in the sham group, giv-
ing a relative rate of 0.82 (95% CI, 0.40-1.71; P = .60). The me-
dian (interquartile range) baseline EDSS score was 2.5 (2.0-
3.0) in the PTA group and 2.5 (2.0-3.5) in the sham group
(Table 1). At 12 months, the median (interquartile range) EDSS
score was 2.0 (1.5-3.0) in the PTA group and 2.0 (1.5-2.5) in the
shamgroup(P = .49).Seventeenof73patients(23%)inthePTA
group had least 1 relapse over the 12 months compared with
12 of 39 (31%) in the sham group. Blinded flow assessment at
12 months revealed restored flow in 38 of 71 patients (54%) in
the PTA group and 14 of 37 (38%) in the sham group.
Secondary Progressive MS
Primary end points for the 15 patients with secondary progres-
sive MS (10 in the PTA group and 5 in the sham group) are
shown, in descriptive form only, in eTable 2 in Supplement 2.
Discussion
Venous PTA did not increase the proportion of patients with
RRMS who improved on the functional composite measure
compared with the sham procedure over the 12-month
follow-up, nor did it significantly reduce the appearance of
new combined brain lesions on MRI at 0 to 12 months.

 stable and similar between the groups at 12 months, match-
ing the composite functional outcome. The annualized
relapse rate was also similar between the groups. Safety data
indicated no serious adverse events attributable to venous
PTA or the sham procedure.
The functional outcome explored by the trial was reduc-
tion in disability as assessed by 5 functions (ie, walking con-
trol, balance, manual dexterity, postvoid residual urine vol-
ume, and visual acuity; eMethods in Supplement 2), which are
themostfrequentcausesofdisabilityinMS.Thehypothesisthat
venousPTAcansignificantlyreducedisabilityisrejectedbyfind-
ings from this study, which not only found no difference be-
tweenthegroupsonthefunctionalcompositemeasurebutalso
no difference for any of its 5 components (Table 3).
The primary MRI outcome measure was a difference in the
number of new combined brain lesions. Venous PTA had no
effect on this measure (Table 2). However, at 12 months, more
than20%ofpatientsinthePTAgroupwerefreeofgadolinium-
enhancing lesions compared with the sham group (OR, 2.76;
95% CI, 1.14-6.68) (Table 4). To explore this effect, which ap-
pears inconsistent with the other MRI data at 0 to 12 months,
weperformedanexploratoryposthoccomparisonofMRIfind-
ings at 0 to 6 months with those at 6 to 12 months (Table 4;
eTable 1 in Supplement 2). We found a reduction in the mean
number of new brain lesions (corresponding to more lesion-
free patients) in the PTA group compared with the sham group
at 6 to 12 months. The delayed and positive effect on the mag-
netic resonance biomarker suggests that PTA could affect the
dynamic of the blood-brain barrier.
Gadolinium enhancement is a marker of damage to the
blood-brain barrier, whose time course depends on lym-
phatic drainage18 and hence on venous drainage from the
skull.19 Previous studies have reported that venous pressure
is lowered3 and cerebrospinal fluid dynamics is improved20
after venous PTA, thereby favoring the drainage of cerebro-
spinal fluid into the dural veins, which depends on a pressure
gradientbetweenthesubarachnoidspacesandduralveins.21,22

 inversely correlated with reduced cerebrospinal fluid dynam-
ics, as measured by MRI. In addition, flow improvement
through the internal jugular veins owing to venous PTA has
been reported to improve brain perfusion in patients with
RRMS.21 It has also been reported that the development of a
new MS plaque was preceded by sustained MRI-detected hy-
poperfusion before the plaque was identified on MRI.24,25
To our knowledge, few published data are available to
compare with Brave Dreams findings. The positive effect of
venous PTA on disability found in the first open-label pilot
study3 was not confirmed in the present study. The first
study3 was not blinded and used the MSFC and the EDSS
scores as primary end points. There is some degree of sub-
jectivity in assessing MSFC and EDSS scores, and with non-
blinded patients and outcome assessors, detection bias may
have been introduced.
In a sham-controlled randomized trial,26 19 patients with
MS (9 assigned to PTA and 10 to sham) were assessed 1, 3, and
6 months after intervention. It was found that clinical and MRI
end points were closely similar in the 2 groups. However, the
study was flawed by the small number of recruited patients
and short follow-up.26 In an observational study,27 29 pa-
tients with RRMS were observed for 2 years after venous PTA.
A small improvement in mean EDSS score occurred over that
time, and the mean annual relapse rate also lowered. Mag-
netic resonance imaging data were not reported.
Limitations
Our study has several limitations. Despite being, to our knowl-
edge, the largest randomized study on venous PTA in RRMS,
the power of the study was limited. There are at least 3 main
reasons for this. First, many MS centers are reluctant to pro-
pose patients for a trial exploring a controversial hypothesis.
Thus, of the 15 centers that initially joined the trial, only 6 ac-
tively recruited. Second, many patients are reluctant to par-
ticipate in a randomized sham-controlled study in spite of the
fact that randomization was 2:1 in favor of angioplasty; this re-
luctancemayhavebeenexacerbatedbythemedia,whichover-
emphasized the effectiveness of venous PTA. Third, the sud-
den widespread availability of venous PTA (and stenting) in
private centers decreased the number of patients fulfilling the
inclusioncriterionofnopreviousangioplasty.Aposthocpower
calculation, based on control findings, indicated a power of
30% to detect a difference in the functional end point and 17%
power to detect the target difference in the MRI end point. In
terms of effect size and clinical relevance, the 95% CI for the
estimated 7% advantage of sham varied from 26.7% in favor
of sham to 10.1% in favor of PTA, thereby excluding the 15%
target threshold for a benefit of venous PTA on the functional
end point. However, the findings on new MRI lesions do not
completely exclude an effect of venous PTA, since the 95% CI
for the mean lesion ratio of 0.72 in favor of PTA includes the
0.65 target for PTA improvement (95% CI, 0.32-1.63).
The use of a new composite functional outcome measure
was a major challenge. Although the outcomes and change
thresholds (reflecting sensitivity to change) of the individual
components have been validated (eMethods in Supplement 2),
the composite is presented for the first time in this article.
Another limitation of the trial is that the severity of the en-
rolledpatientsintermsofEDSSscoreandlesionloadwaslower

 than anticipated, and patients with active disease may have
been underrepresented in the study (Table 1). Finally, the fact
that venous PTA was largely ineffective in restoring blood flow
in nearly half the patients in the PTA group suggests that it was
inadequate for exploring our initial hypothesis.
Conclusions
A number of neurologists and scientists expressed the opin-
ion that the decision to conduct a trial on CCSVI in the
absence of valid scientific evidence was unethical and a
waste of resources.28 However, we believe that the best way
to provide useful information to patients (and regulatory
authorities) on the benefit and safety of venous PTA was to
conduct a randomized trial—as also recommended by
NICE7—that assessed outcomes directly relevant to
patients.29 Venous PTA has proven to be a safe but ineffec-
tive technique in treating CCSVI in about half of patients.
The procedure cannot be recommended for treatment of
patients with MS; no further double-blinded clinical studies
are needed. The delayed effect of venous PTA 6 months after
the procedure on the magnetic resonance biomarker sug-
gests a possibility that PTA may produce benefit for a sub-
group of patients with MS. This should be further analyzed
and investigated.
