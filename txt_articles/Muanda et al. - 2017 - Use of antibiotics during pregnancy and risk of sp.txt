A
lthough antibiotics are widely used during pregnancy, the 
fetal safety of macrolides, quinolones, tetracyclines, met-
ronidazole and nitrofurantoin remains a concern. Existing 
literature on the association between gestational anti 
biotic use 
and the risk of spontaneous abortion provides conflicting results. 
Four studies using data from teratology information services did 
not find an association between the use of macrolides and sponta-
neous abortion.1–4 In contrast, a Danish study based on data from a 
prescription database found an increased risk of spontaneous 
abortion associated with the use of clarithromycin.5 Three studies 
using data from teratology information services failed to show a 
link between the use of quinolones and the risk of spontaneous 
abortion,6–8 and an early Medicaid study showed an association 
with the use of metronidazole.9 However, the studies were all lim-
ited by either small samples, or recall or indication bias.1–9 Studies 
of the risk of spontaneous abortion associated with tetracyclines 
and nitrofurantoin are lacking.
We aimed to quantify the association between exposure to 
antibiotics during pregnancy and the risk of spontaneous abortion, 
taking into account methodologic limitations of previous studies.
Methods
Study design
We conducted a nested case–control study within the Quebec 
Pregnancy Cohort.
Data sources
We used data from the Quebec Pregnancy Cohort, which is an 
ongoing population-based cohort with prospective data collection 
on all pregnancies of women covered by the Quebec Public Pre-
scription Drug Insurance Plan, from January 1998 to December 
2009. Information for each pregnancy is obtained from province-
wide databases and linked using unique personal identifiers.

ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND: Although antibiotics are 
widely used during pregnancy, evidence 
regarding their fetal safety remains lim-
ited. Our aim was to quantify the associ-
ation between antibiotic exposure dur-
ing pregnancy and risk of spontaneous 
abortion.
METHODS: We conducted a nested 
case–control study within the Quebec 
Pregnancy Cohort (1998–2009). We ex-
cluded planned abortions and pregnan-
cies exposed to fetotoxic drugs. Sponta-
neous abortion was defined as having a 
diagnosis or procedure related to spon-
taneous abortion before the 20th week 
of pregnancy. The index date was de-
fined as the calendar date of the spon-
taneous abortion. Ten controls per case 
were randomly selected and matched 
by gestational age and year of preg-
nancy. Use of antibiotics was defined by 
filled prescriptions between the first 
day of gestation and the index date and 
was compared with (a) non-exposure 
and (b) exposure to penicillins or ceph-
alosporins. We studied type of anti-
biotics separately using the same com-
parator groups. 
RESULTS: After adjustment for potential 
confounders, use of azithromycin (ad-
justed odds ratio [OR] 1.65, 95% confi-
dence interval [CI] 1.34–2.02; 110 ex-
posed cases), clarithromycin (adjusted 
OR 2.35, 95% CI 1.90–2.91; 111 exposed 
cases), metronidazole (adjusted OR 1.70, 
95% CI 1.27–2.26; 53 exposed cases), sul-
fonamides (adjusted OR 2.01, 95% CI 
1.36–2.97; 30 exposed cases), tetra-
cyclines (adjusted OR 2.59, 95% CI 1.97–
3.41; 67 exposed cases) and quinolones 
(adjusted OR 2.72, 95% CI 2.27–3.27; 160 
exposed cases) was associated with an 
increased risk of spontaneous abortion. 
Similar results were found when we 
used penicillins or cephalosporins as the 
comparator group.
INTERPRETATION: After adjustment for 
potential confounders, use of macro-
lides (excluding erythromycin), quino-
lones, tetracyclines, sulfonamides and 
metronidazole during early pregnancy 
was associated with an increased risk of 
spontaneous abortion. Our findings may 
be of use to policy-makers to update 
guidelines for the treatment of infections 
during pregnancy.

CMAJ  |  MAY 1, 2017  |  VOLUME 189  |  ISSUE 17 
The Quebec Pregnancy Cohort was constructed by identifying 
all pregnancies in the Régie de l’assurance maladie du Québec 
(RAMQ) and the provincial hospital discharge database (MED-
ÉCHO). We determined the day of the last menstrual period 
(defined as the first day of gestation) using data on gestational 
age, which was validated against data in patient charts and ultra-
sound measures.10
Prospective follow-up data were available from 1 year before 
the first day of gestation, during pregnancy and until December 
2009. The data sources for this study included RAMQ (diagnoses, 
medical procedures, socioeconomic status of women and pre-
scribers), the province’s Public Prescription Drug Insurance Plan 
database (drug name, start date, dosage and duration), MED-
ÉCHO (in-hospital diagnoses and procedures, and gestational 
age) and the Institut de la statistique du Quebec (patient socio-
demographic data and birth weight). The data sources used, as 
well as the Quebec Pregnancy Cohort, have been described 
previously.11
Study population
We included women who were 15–45 years of age on the first day 
of gestation and were continuously insured by the province’s 
drug plan for at least 12 months before and during their preg-
nancy. We excluded pregnancies with exposure to known terato-
genic drugs12,13 and those terminated by planned abortion. We 
included all pregnancies meeting our inclusion criteria for 
women who had more than 1 pregnancy during the study period.
Cases
For cases, we identified pregnancies with a diagnosis or proce-
dure related to spontaneous abortion before the 20th week of 
gestation using diagnostic codes of the International Classifica-
tion of Diseases (ICD-9 codes 630–634 and ICD-10 codes O01–
O03). We considered only women with clinically detected spona-
neous abortion. We defined the index date as the calendar date 
of the spontaneous abortion.
For each case, we determined the first day of gestation by 
subtracting the gestational age (based on ultrasound) from the 
calendar date of the spontaneous abortion. If the information 
was missing in the database, we used an algorithm to estimate 
the gestational age (Appendix 1, available at www.cmaj.ca/
lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj.161020/-/DC1).
Controls
We selected 10 controls for each case at the index date and 
matched them by gestational age (within 3 d) and year of preg-
nancy. We chose this number of controls because the control–
case ratio needs to increase to 10 or more to increase statistical 
power when the prevalence of exposure to the study drug is less 
than 15% among controls (as in our study).14 Suissa and col-
leagues have used such numbers in many studies in similar situa-
tions.15,16 On the basis of a relative power table for nested case–
control studies, if we assumed a prevalence of exposure of 5% 
among controls, a number of case–control sets fixed to 100, a 
control–case ratio of 10, a relative power of 80% and a type 1 
error of 5%, we planned to detect an odds ratio (OR) of 1.5.17
Exposure
We defined antibiotic exposure as having filled at least 1 pre-
scription for any type of antibiotic either between the first day of 
gestation and the index date, or before pregnancy but with a 
duration that overlapped the first day of gestation.
We considered the following classes of antibiotics, defined 
according to the American Hospital Formulary Service (AHFS) 
categories: cephalosporins (AHFS 8:12.06), macrolides (AHFS 
8:12.12), penicillins (AHFS 8:12.16), quinolones (AHFS 8:12.18) 
sulfonamides (AHFS 8:12.20), tetracyclines (AHFS 8:12.24), other 
antibacterials (AHFS 8:12.28), antiprotozoals (AHFS 8:30.92) and 
urinary anti-infectives (AHFS 8:36).
We considered the following individual antibiotics: amoxicil-
lin, amoxicillin–potassium clavulanate, phenoxymethylpenicillin, 
cephalexin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, ciprofloxacin, norflox-
acin, levofloxacin, clindamycin, doxycycline, minocycline, eryth-
romycin, metronidazole and nitrofurantoin.
To take into account the baseline risk of spontaneous abor-
tion in the general population, we defined a non-exposure cate-
gory as pregnancy with no antibiotic exposure between the first 
day of gestation and the index date.
To take into account the underlying indication, we used preg-
nancies with exposure to penicillins as an active comparator 
group because penicillin is the most commonly prescribed anti-
microbial class during pregnancy and has the most robust safety 
data during this period.18 Further, we also used cephalosporin 
exposure as an active comparator group because it is an alterna-
tive to penicillin for patients allergic or intolerant to penicillins 
and it has a long history of documented use in pregnancy.18
Covariates
We measured covariates for 3 periods: (a) as of the first day of ges-
tation (maternal age, area of residence [urban v. rural], receipt of 
social assistance during pregnancy, education level in years [≤ 12 
v. > 12] and marital status [living alone v. cohabiting]; (b) in the 
year before and during pregnancy until the index date (physician-
based diagnoses or filled prescriptions of related medications for 
chronic comorbidities [depression, asthma, diabetes mellitus, 
chronic hypertension, thyroid disorder, epilepsy, and rheumatoid 
polyarthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus]; physician-based 
diagnoses of endometriosis, uterine malformations and maternal 
infections [urinary tract infection, respiratory tract infection, bac-
terial vaginosis and sexually transmitted infections]; and use of 
other anti-infective agents); and (c) in the year before pregnancy 
(use of health services, and history of planned and spontaneous 
abortions).
Diagnostic and medication codes used to identify covariates 
are listed in Appendix 2. To illustrate the structure of confound-
ing with maternal infections, we used a Directed Acyclic Graph19 
(Appendix 3). (The appendices are available at www.cmaj.ca/
lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj.161020/-/DC1.)
Statistical analysis
We calculated descriptive analyses to summarize the characteris-
tics of the study population using t tests and χ2 tests for continu-
ous and categorical variables, respectively.

E627
We calculated crude and adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% 
confidence intervals (CIs) using conditional generalized estima-
tion equations.
We performed several sensitivity analyses. First, we defined the 
time window for antibiotic exposure as the period from the first 
day of gestation to 15 days before the index date, to ensure that 
exposure to the study medication preceded the study outcome. 
Second, to address indication bias, we restricted our analysis to 
pregnancies with urinary or respiratory tract infections. Third, we 
considered only spontaneous abortions that had gestational age 
determined on the basis of ultrasound. Fourth, given that many 
early pregnancy losses are not recognized clinically, we excluded 
spontaneous abortions that occurred before 6 completed weeks of 
gestation. Fifth, given that we performed 27 hypothesis tests in our 
study, we adjusted for multiple testing using the Bonferroni cor-
rection.20 We considered an association between antibiotic class or 
type and spontaneous abortion to be statistically significant if the 
p value was less than 0.002 (i.e., 0.05/27).
We considered all analyses significant at a p value of less than 
0.05 (2-tailed). When results were not significant, we performed a 
post hoc power analysis. We conducted all analyses using SAS 
version 9.3 software (SAS Institute Inc.).
Ethics approval
This study was approved by the research ethics board of the Cen-
tre hospitalier universitaire Sainte-Justine. The linkage between 
administrative databases was authorized by the Commission 
d’accès à l’information du Québec.
Results
We identified 182 369 pregnancies that met the inclusion criteria, 
8702 (4.7%) of which ended with a clinically detected spontane-
ous abortion (Figure 1). The mean gestational age was 14.1 (stan-
dard deviation 3.1) weeks (median 14 wk). For 1068 (12.3%) of 
the cases, the gestational age was based on ultrasound. Com-
pared with the 87 020 matched controls, women with spontane-
ous abortion were more likely to be older, to be living alone, and 
to have comorbidities and infections (Table 1).
Classes and types of antibiotics
After adjustment for potential confounders, use of azithromycin 
(adjusted OR 1.65, 95% CI 1.34–2.02; 110 exposed cases), clarithro-
mycin (adjusted OR 2.35, 95% CI 1.90–2.91; 111 exposed cases), 
tetracyclines (adjusted OR 2.59, 95% CI 1.97–3.41; 67 exposed 
cases), doxycycline (adjusted OR 2.81, 95% CI 1.93–4.10; 36 
exposed cases), minocycline (adjusted OR 2.48, 95% CI 1.54–4.00; 
21 exposed cases), quinolones (adjusted OR 2.72, 95% CI 2.27–
3.27; 160 exposed cases), ciprofloxacin (adjusted OR 2.45, 95% CI 
1.98–3.03; 114 exposed cases), norfloxacin (adjusted OR 4.81, 95% 
CI 2.05–11.26; 8 exposed cases), levofloxacin (adjusted OR 3.28, 
95% CI 1.73–6.24; 14 exposed cases), sulfonamides (adjusted OR 
2.01, 95% CI 1.36–2.97; 30 exposed cases) and metronidazole 
(adjusted OR 1.70, 95% CI 1.27–2.26; 53 exposed cases) was associ-
ated with an increased risk of spontaneous abortion. An increased 
risk of spontaneous abortion was not associated with use of nitro-
furantoin (adjusted OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.51–0.96; 39 exposed cases) 
or erythromycin (adjusted OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.49–1.01; 29 exposed 
cases) (Table 2; Figure 2; Appendices 4 and 5, available at www.
cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj.161020/-/DC1). Similar 
results were found when we used penicillins or cephalosporins as 
the comparator group.
Sensitivity analyses
When we looked at the risk of spontaneous abortion in pregnan-
cies exposed to antibiotics between the first day of gestation until 
15 days before the index date, our results were similar to those in 
the main analysis (Appendices 6 and 7, available at www.cmaj.ca/
lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj.161020/-/DC1). In a subgroup 
analysis of pregnancies with urinary tract infection, quinolone 
exposure was associated with an increased risk of spontaneous 
abortion when compared with penicillin use (adjusted OR 8.73, 
95% CI 3.08–24.77; 17 exposed cases) (Appendix 8, available at 
www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj.161020/-/DC1).

When we restricted the analysis to pregnancies with respiratory 
tract infections, we found that use of macrolides had an increased 
OR for spontaneous abortion compared with penicillin, but the 
association was not statistically significant (adjusted OR 1.89, 95% 
CI 0.97–3.69; 17 exposed cases; post hoc power analysis = 52%) 
(Appendix 9, available at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/
cmaj.161020/-/DC1).
In the analysis restricted to spontaneous abortions with gesta-
tional age determined by ultrasound, our results were consistent 
with those in the main analysis except for quinolones (adjusted OR 
0.17, 95% CI 0.01–2.10; 4 exposed cases; post hoc power analysis = 
54%; Appendix 10, available at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/
doi:10.1503/cmaj.161020/-/DC1). When we excluded spontaneous 
abortions occurring before 6 weeks’ gestation, our results were 
also similar to those in the main analysis (Appendix 11, available at 
www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/doi: 
10.1503/cmaj.161020/-/DC1).
After adjustment for multiple testing, our results were similar 
to those in the main analysis (Appendices 12 and 13, available at 
www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj.161020/-/DC1).
Interpretation
After adjustment for potential confounders, use of macrolides 
(excluding erythromycin), quinolones, tetracyclines, sulfon-
amides and metronidazole during early pregnancy was associ-
ated with an increased risk of spontaneous abortion. Nitrofur-
antoin exposure was not associated with an increased risk of 
spontaneous abortion; this finding supports its use as an alterna-
tive to trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole for the treatment of uri-
nary tract infection during pregnancy.21
The increased risk of spontaneous abortion associated with 
the use of azithromycin and clarithromycin (65% and twofold 
increased risk, respectively) was consistent with findings in 2 pre-
vious studies (56% and 2-fold increased risk of spontaneous 
abortion with clarithromycin exposure).4,5 Conversely, our find-
ings on azithromycin are different from those in a teratology 
information services study;3 the difference may be explained by 
the study’s small sample.
A class effect was reported for the tetracyclines and quino-
lone classes. This finding supports current guidelines used in 
obstetrics that do not recommend use of these drugs in early 
pregnancy.22 In contrast, previous studies failed to show an asso-
ciation. These discrepancies may be explained by a lack of statis-
tical power and a recall bias.6–8
Metronidazole exposure was associated with a 70% increased 
risk of spontaneous abortion, which is consistent with a Medicaid 
cohort study that showed a 67% increased risk of spontaneous 
abortion.9

Strengths and limitations
Our study included a large sample, valid information on filled 
prescriptions, and prospectively and routinely collected data on 
physician-based diagnoses or procedures related to spontane-
ous abortion, which limited the potential for detection bias. 
Other strengths include the use of 2 active comparator groups, 
adjustment for maternal infections and sensitivity analyses.
The use of a nested case–control design minimized selection 
bias, and adjustment for multiple comparisons ruled out a 
chance finding.
Confounding by infection severity is a potential limitation. Pen-
icillins or cephalosporins have overlapping indications with other 
antibiotics (quinolones and macrolides) in Quebec. For example, 
β-lactams are among the first-line treatments of noncomplicated 
v. no antibiotic use

urinary tract infections and the treatment of community-acquired 
pneumonia in patients with comorbidities.23,24 Therefore, women 
receiving penicillins or cephalosporins would not be very different 
from those receiving other antibiotics. Nevertheless, we acknowl-
edge that the main reason for confounding by indication in our 
study may be differences in the severity of infections. However, we 
adjusted for several documented proxies for infection severity, 
such as prior exposure to antibiotics, comorbidities, hospital-
based diagnosis of maternal infections and prior hospital admis-
sions.25–27 We feel confident that confounding by infection severity 
cannot fully explain our findings, although residual confounding 
cannot be completely rule out.
Many classes of antibiotics were associated with an increased 
risk of spontaneous abortion. The presence of unmeasured con-
founders could be a possible explanation for these results. Some 
potential confounders are not available in the Quebec Pregnancy 
Cohort, including smoking status, folic acid use, alcohol intake, 
body mass index and other dietary factors. However, we used 2 ac-
tive comparator groups to attenuate potential differences related 
to these variables between treatment groups.28 Therefore, unmea-
sured confounding, if present, would not fully explain this finding.
Biological plausibility of the association between the use of 
those antibiotic classes and the risk of spontaneous abortion has 
been reported in the literature. A possible mechanism explaining 
this effect for clarithromycin involves its proarrhythmic properties 
(through inhibition of a specific cardiac potassium channel) that 
play a role in cardiac rhythm regulation in early embryonic develop-
ment.29 Quinolone may act as a DNA gyrase inhibitor as well as a 
mitotic inhibitor.30 Tetracycline inhibits the production of proinflam-
matory cytokines, and of matrix metalloproteinases known to play a 
role in tissue remodelling, trophoblast invasion and endometrial 
decidualization.31,32 Metronidazole may increase the production of 
reactive intermediates, which may result in DNA damage.33
Data on filled prescriptions in the Quebec Pregnancy Cohort 
may not reflect actual drug use. However, they have been vali-
dated against maternal reports and showed a high positive and 
negative predictive value for antibiotic exposure (86.7% and 
92.3%, respectively).34
Although we performed subgroup analyses, some of them 
were underpowered given the small number of exposed cases.
We included only clinically detected spontaneous abortions. 
If there is an association between antibiotic exposure and the 
risk of nonclinically detected spontaneous abortion, our findings 
are conservative and thus underestimate the true risk. However, 
if there is no such association, a nondifferential misclassification 
is likely, and again our estimates are conservative.
The gestational age at the time of spontaneous abortion was 
not systematically determined on the basis of ultrasound. Never-
theless, when we restricted our analysis to spontaneous abor-
tions with gestational age based on ultrasound, our findings 
were consistent with those in our main analysis except for quino-
lones; however, the analysis was underpowered.
We included only pregnant women who were insured by the 
province’s Prescription Drug Insurance program. Therefore, our 
results may not be generalizable to those with private drug 
insurance.35
Conclusion
Use of macrolides (excluding erythromycin), quinolones, tetra-
cyclines, sulfonamides and metronidazole during early pregnancy 
was associated with an increased risk of spontaneous abortion. 
However, residual confounding by severity of infection cannot be 
ruled out. Our findings may be of use to policy-makers to update 
guidelines for the treatment of infections during pregnancy.
