What is already known about this topic? Asthma affects a large proportion of pregnant women worldwide and is
associated with adverse outcomes. Unknown and unmeasurable confounders might play a role in the association between
asthma and adverse pregnancy and delivery outcomes.
What does this article add to our knowledge? We found that the association between asthma and adverse pregnancy,
delivery, and perinatal outcomes remained after adjusting for genetic and environmental factors shared by siblings and
cousins.
How does this study impact current management guidelines? Maternal asthma continues to be an important clinical
target to diminish risks of adverse pregnancy, delivery, and perinatal outcomes.
BACKGROUND: Asthma is associated with several adverse
pregnancy and perinatal outcomes. Familial factors may
confound these associations.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the role of measured and unmeasured
confounding by conducting a study that compared differentially
exposed cousins and siblings from the same families.
METHODS: We retrieved data on adverse pregnancy outcomes,
prescribed drugs, and physician-diagnosed asthma from
nationwide registers for all women in Sweden with singleton
births between 2001 and 2013. Logistic and linear regression
estimated the association between maternal asthma and several
outcomes in the whole population and within differently
exposed pregnant relatives.
RESULTS: In total, 1,075,153 eligible pregnancies were
included and 10.1% of the study population had asthma. We
identified 475,200 cousin and 341,205 sister pregnancies.
Women with asthma had increased risks for preeclampsia
(adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.17; 95% CI, 1.13-1.21), emergency
cesarean section (aOR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.22-1.27), and having a
child small for gestational age (aOR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.12-1.23).
In the conditional regression analyses, after adjustment for
familial factors, the associations remained: preeclampsia in
cousins (aOR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.07-1.25) and siblings (aOR, 1.23;
95% CI, 1.08-1.38), emergency cesarean section in cousins
(aOR, 1.28) and siblings (aOR, 1.21), and small for gestational
age in cousins (aOR, 1.17) and siblings (aOR, 1.13).

CONCLUSIONS: Factors shared by siblings and cousins do
not seem to explain the observed association between maternal
asthma and adverse pregnancy outcomes. This implies that
targeting the asthma disease will continue to be important in
reducing risks for adverse outcomes in pregnancy.

Key words: Asthma; Epidemiology; Family design; Pregnancy;
Pregnancy outcomes
Asthma is a common disease that affects a large proportion of
the population; its prevalence is estimated to be 8% to 10%
among women of childbearing age.1,2 There are substantial ge-
netic influences on asthma in the adult population,3 and shared
environmental factors, such as family size, smoking, socioeco-
nomic status, and health management behavior, have also
been shown to play a role in the development of the disease in
adults.4-6 Previous studies have shown increased risks of several
adverse pregnancy and delivery outcomes in women with
asthma7,8 and in a large population-based study we recently
found associations between asthma in pregnant women and
several
adverse
pregnancy,
delivery,
and
birth
outcomes,
regardless of the level of asthma control.9 However, it is not
known to what extent genetic and familial environmental factors
play a role for these adverse outcomes in women with asthma.
To account for some of these unmeasured possible confounders,
it is possible to use a quasi-experimental design with cousin/sibling
controls. This family-based design allows for adjustments for all
factors shared between siblings or cousins. If such analyses show an
equally strong association after these adjustments, the exposure
studied (in this case maternal asthma) is a potential causal risk factor
for the outcome. If the association weakens compared with that
based on unrelated controls, it is likely that familial factors have
confounded the observed association. A family-based design does
not confirm causality, but it gives stronger support of a casual effect
compared with ordinary observational studies because it is possible
to adjust for some important unmeasured, unmeasurable, or un-
known confounders.10-13
Our hypothesis was that maternal asthma is causally related to
adverse pregnancy outcomes such as preeclampsia or eclampsia,
placental abruption, delivery mode, birth weight, and gestational
age. To test our hypothesis rigorously, we adjusted for measured
covariates as well as unmeasured genetic and shared familial
factors by conducting a register- based study, with sibling and
cousin control designs, based on all women who gave birth in
Sweden during the period 2001 to 2013.
METHODS
Study design and population
This population-based study was conducted using several Swedish
health and population registers. The registers were linked using the
unique personal identification number assigned to all permanent
residents of Sweden.14 We used the Swedish Medical Birth Regis-
ter,15,16 covering approximately 99% of all births in Sweden, to
identify all women giving birth in the years 2001 to 2013. In a
second step, we linked these women to the Multi Generation Reg-
ister17 to identify full sisters and full cousins. In addition, we used
information from the National Patient Register, which covers all in-
patient care in Sweden since 1987 and 75% of all outpatient visits
from 2001,18 and the Swedish Prescribed Drug Register, which
contains all prescribed drugs dispensed at pharmacies in Sweden
since July 1, 2005.19 The use of a prescription for asthma medica-
tion in the Swedish Prescribed Drug Register as a proxy for asthma
disease has been validated previously.20
We excluded multiple gestation pregnancies because their char-
acteristics often differ from those in singleton pregnancies, making
any observed associations difficult to interpret.21 Permission for this
study was obtained from the Regional Ethical Review board in
Stockholm, Sweden (reference 2014/2037-32). In accordance with
their decision, we did not obtain informed consent from participants
involved in the study. All data were deidentified before analyses.
Exposure
Our exposure was maternal asthma from the age of 15 years until
delivery. Information on asthma was collected from 3 different
sources: the National Patient Register; the Medical Birth Register
with information on pregnancy, delivery, and perinatal outcomes
and diagnoses recorded at antenatal visits and delivery wards; and
records of asthma medication from the Swedish Prescribed Drug
Register. From the National Patient Register and the Medical Birth
Register we identified asthma diagnoses (code 493 according to the
International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revison, and codes J45
and J46 according to the International Classification of Diseases,
Tenth Revison). From the Medical Birth Register, we collected data
on whether the mother had ever had asthma (a question asked by the
midwife in early pregnancy and present as a tick-box), and from the
Prescribed Drug Register, for women being pregnant from July 1,
2006, we identified all those who had asthma medication dispensed
at least twice from the year before pregnancy until delivery
(Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System codes
R03AC, R03AK, R03BA, and R03DC).
Outcome
The outcome data (pregnancy, delivery, and perinatal complica-
tions and diagnoses) were collected from the Medical Birth Register
based on the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revison
codes for preeclampsia/eclampsia (O14-15) and placental abruption
(O45). We also assessed the mode of delivery and several birth
outcomes (birth weight and gestational age as well as small and large
for gestational age22).
Covariates
Possible confounders were selected using directed acyclic graphs23
and collected from the Medical Birth Register (smoking [none/1-9
cigarettes/�10 cigarettes per day], body mass index, civil status
[married or cohabiting/single/other situations], and the participant’s
country of birth [Sweden/other Scandinavian countries/rest of the
world]). All data used from the Medical Birth Register were reported
at the first antenatal visit. There are data on body mass index and
smoking during pregnancy as well but those data are not as reliable.
Socioeconomic status, defined as the highest level of education, was
extracted from the longitudinal integration database for health in-
surance and labor market studies (LISA by Swedish acronym)

Online Repository at www.jaci-inpractice.org).
Statistical analyses
In a first step, we assessed the prevalence of asthma and its effects
on pregnancy outcomes and we performed logistic and linear
regression analyses, for categorical and continuous outcome vari-
ables, respectively. We estimated the crude and adjusted odds ratios
(aORs) and average difference in mean birth weight/gestational age
with 95% CIs in the full cohort.9 In a second step, we used con-
ditional logistic regression, conditioning on full sibling pairs (same
mother and father) and cousin pairs (common grandparents) in
separate analyses, and for the continuous outcomes a linear regres-
sion model with fixed effects estimator. We could then estimate
associations adjusted for genetic factors (for sisters on average 50%
and cousins 12.5%) and shared (familial) environment. If the sta-
tistical association is due to familial confounding, the comparison of
differently exposed pairs will result in changed estimates, with a
possible gradient from the full cohort, to cousins to siblings.25 Some
women contributed with more than 1 pregnancy, which caused
dependency within clusters. Therefore, we used the sandwich esti-
mator in the logistic and linear regression analyses for the full cohort
and bootstrapping of clusters with 200 repetitions to estimate 95%
CIs for the cousin and sibling analyses.
We also performed a sensitivity analysis using either only asthma
diagnosis (from the National Patient Register, the Medical Birth
Register) or only prescribed drugs (from the Prescribed Drug Reg-
ister). Furthermore, in a sensitivity analysis, we did single-year an-
alyses, constraining the years to either 2001 or 2013 to find out
whether different years of pregnancy and birth affect the observed
associations, considering the more complete asthma information
from 2005 and onward.
All analyses were done using STATA 14 (StataCorp LLC, College
Station, Texas).
RESULTS
In a study population of 661,956 women we identified
1,075,153 eligible pregnancies between the years 2001 and
2013. In total 321,339 women had 1 pregnancy, 277,268 had 2
pregnancies, and 63,349 women had 3 or more pregnancies.
Asthma according to our definition was defined for 108,225
pregnancies (10.1%). We identified 475,200 pregnancies in full
cousin pairs and 341,205 in full sister pairs during the study
period; background characteristics are presented in Table I. The
number of cousins and siblings with asthma and giving birth
during the study period was 48,620 (43,286 with full covariate
information) and 32,905 (29,317 with full covariate informa-
tion), respectively.
In the full cohort analyses, women with asthma had increased
risks for both preeclampsia/eclampsia (aOR, 1.17; 95% CI,
1.13-1.21) and placental abruption (aOR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.15-
1.41). Furthermore, instrumental and cesarean deliveries were
more common in women with asthma than in women without
asthma; for instance, instrumental delivery (aOR, 1.09; 95% CI,
1.07-1.12) and emergency cesarean section (aOR, 1.24; 95% CI,
1.22- 1.27) (Table II). Children born to women with asthma had
a lower mean birth weight (47 g lower, 95% CI, 42-51 g) and
the mean gestational age was 0.12 weeks lower (95% CI, 0.11-
0.13). There was also an increased risk of small for gestational age
(aOR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.12-1.23) and a decreased risk of large for
gestational age (aOR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.88-0.95) among women
with asthma (Table II).
When we analyzed cousins and sisters discordant for the
exposure, the estimates found in the full cohort analyses
remained essentially unchanged for preeclampsia/eclampsia (aOR
in cousins, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.07-1.25; aOR for siblings, 1.23;
95% CI, 1.08-1.38) and slightly attenuated for placental
abruption (aOR in cousins, 1.19; 95% CI, 0.88-1.49 and aOR
in siblings, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.76-1.44). Similarly, the estimates for
modes of delivery also remained (eg, emergency cesarean section
aOR in cousins, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.20-1.36 and aOR in siblings,
1.21; 95% CI, 1.09-1.33) (Table II).
For the association between maternal asthma and perinatal
outcomes (Table II), the estimates for birth weight found in the
full cohort remained for cousins (39 g lower, 95% CI, 32-46 g)
and siblings (34 g lower, 95% CI, 24-44 g). For the association
between maternal asthma and gestational age, the estimates
found in the cohort analyses also remained in the analyses for
cousin pair (0.10 weeks shorter, 95% CI, 0.07-0.12 weeks) and
sibling pairs (0.06 weeks shorter, 95% CI, 0.03-0.09 weeks). In
the small and large for gestational age analyses, the OR estimates
for cousins and siblings were also very close to those in the full
cohort, although for siblings the effect was no longer statistically
significant.
The sensitivity analyses showed no apparent differences be-
tween different sources of data on asthma disease (see Table E1
in this article’s Online Repository at www.jaci-inpractice.org),
between years of delivery (see Table E2 in this article’s Online
Repository at www.jaci-inpractice.org), or previous (from age 15
years until 1 year before pregnancy) versus current (in the year
before or during pregnancy) asthma (see Table E3 in this article’s
Online Repository at www.jaci-inpractice.org).
DISCUSSION
In this population-based study of more than a million preg-
nancies, we found that maternal asthma is a risk factor for pre-
eclampsia/eclampsia, placental abruption, vaginal instrumental
delivery, cesarean section, lower birth weight, lower gestational
age, and small for gestational age. This confirms our previous
results.9 When the analysis was done exclusively on cousins and
full siblings, the estimates for preeclampsia/eclampsia, vaginal
instrumental delivery, cesarean section, lower birth weight, and
gestational age remained significantly more common in women
with asthma than in women without asthma, suggesting that the
association
between
asthma
and
these
outcomes
is
not
confounded
by
common
environment,
shared
genes,
or
measured covariates. The findings are consistent with a causal
effect between maternal asthma and these adverse pregnancy
outcomes.
Previous studies
In several previous studies on the potential risk factors of
maternal asthma on placental abruption, low birth weight, pre-
maturity, and small for gestational age,26,27 findings have sug-
gested that these conditions, along with preeclampsia, share
common pathophysiological mechanisms involving a defect in
the physiologic transformation of the spiral arteries of the
placenta28—an ischaemic placental disease. Although such a
condition might not necessarily be a direct effect of a respiratory
disease such as asthma, it could at least be significantly worsened
because of intermittent maternal hypoxia or disease-related

 inflammation. In our study, the association between maternal
asthma and preeclampsia was not confounded by common
environment or shared genetic factors. This supports the notion
of a causal link between asthma (or some condition covarying
with or caused by asthma) and preeclampsia.
For placental abruption, however, the positive association with
maternal asthma was attenuated in comparisons of cousins and
siblings discordant for asthma exposure. This implies that the
associations with maternal asthma may be confounded by factors
shared within families, such as genetic predisposition,29,30 health
management behavior, and exposure to environmental agents.
However, placental abruption may have other causes, not likely
to be shared within families, such as abdominal trauma during
pregnancy, chorioamnionitis, and previous cesarean section.31
Concerning the outcome small for gestational age, the esti-
mates for first cousins (same maternal or paternal grandparents
and on average 12.5% shared genes) fall between those for full
siblings (same parents and on average 50% shared genes) and
those for unrelated nonexposed individuals. This would suggest
confounding from familial factors. However, the estimates dif-
ferences are very small with overlapping CIs.
For the outcomes associated with asthma disease and seem-
ingly not confounded by familial factors, there might be residual
confounding by factors that cause both asthma and the outcomes
studied, but not shared by siblings or cousins. Inflammatory
pathways might be one of those factors, for instance, seen in the
known covariation between asthma and allergies.32
Strengths and limitations
The large study population with 1,075,153 singleton pregnancies,
including 475,200 cousin pregnancies and 341,205 sister pregnan-
cies, is a major strength of this study. The comparisons enabled us to
take unmeasured familial factors into account by using cousin and
sibling controls. Furthermore, both exposure (asthma) and outcomes
have been validated15,20 and collected prospectively and indepen-
dently, thus eliminating the risk of recall bias. The abundance of data
and the size of the population also made it possible for us to adjust for
several known confounders, such as socioeconomic status and
smoking. Becauseitis apopulation-basedstudy, itis alsogeneralizable
to other populations.
There are also some limitations to the study design. First, being a
register-based study there were no data on indications for different
mode of deliveries, allowing us only to speculate on the choices.
Second, although cousin and sibling designs allow us to adjust for
unmeasured confounding, this approach has limitations (describedby
Frisell et al33) that are important to take into consideration, such as
measurement errors regarding the exposure, or confounders shared to
a lower extent within families. However, unmeasured confounding is
unlikely to be a problem because we collected our exposure data from
several independent sources, and subanalyses using the different
sources alone produce similar estimates. Moreover, the variable for
exposure was the same in each set of analyses and the acquired esti-
mates were indeed not lowered for all studied outcomes in the family
comparison. Also, confounders shared to a lower extent within
families would, if being responsible for our observed results, be factors
affecting placental abruption, birth weight, gestational age, and small
for gestational age, but not preeclampsia or mode of delivery, which is
unlikely. Third, in this study, because the only informative partici-
pants in the family-based analyses are those discordant for asthma and
the outcomes, there is a drop in statistical power and we cannot rule
out that this is the reason for the lack of statistically significant results
concerning placental abruption and small for gestational age.
The drop in power also limits us in studying subpopulations
with different asthma severity. In our previous study, however,
we did not see any clear trend in more adverse outcomes in
controlled versus uncontrolled asthma.9 Finally, because this is
an observational study, it is not possible to determine causation.
CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS
To our knowledge, this is the first study on the effect of maternal
asthma on pregnancy and delivery outcomes that uses a cousin and
sibling control approach. We have shown that the associations be-
tween asthma and the adverse outcomes preeclampsia/eclampsia,
instrumental delivery, cesarean section, birth weight, and gestational
agedonotseemtobeconfoundedbygeneticorenvironmental factors
shared by first cousins or full siblings. By reducing familial con-
founding we have been able to show that familial (genetic and envi-
ronmental) factors shared by cousins and siblings do not seem to
explain the observed association between maternal asthma and
adverse pregnancy outcomes. This implies that targeting the asthma
disease will continue to be important in reducing risks for adverse
outcomes in pregnancy. Further research should confirm our findings
in other populations representing genetic and environmental het-
erogeneity as well as explore how to best monitor and individualize
treatment during pregnancy in women with varying asthma pheno-
types and severity.
