Abstract
Aim: Funding cuts to the aged care industry impact catering budgets and aged care staffing levels, which may in
turn affect the nutritional status of aged care residents. This paper reports average food expenditure and trends in
Australian residential aged care facilities (RACFs).
Methods: This is a retrospective study collecting RACFs’ economic outlay data through a quarterly online survey
conducted over the 2015 and 2016 financial years.
Results: Data were compiled from 817 RACFs, representing 64 256 residential beds and 23 million bed-days
Australia-wide. The average total spend in Australian Dollars (AUD) on catering consumables (including cutlery/
crockery, supplements, paper goods) was $8.00 per resident per day (prpd) and $6.08 prpd when looking at the raw
food and ingredients budget alone. Additional data from over half the RACFs (n = 456, 56%) indicate a 5% decrease
in food cost ($0.31 prpd) in the last year, particularly in fresh produce, with a simultaneous 128% ($0.50 prpd)
increase in cost for supplements and food replacements. Current figures are comparatively less than aged care food
budgets internationally (US, UK and Canada), less than community-dwelling older adults ($17.25 prpd) and 136% less
than Australian corrective services ($8.25 prpd).
Conclusions: The current spend on food in RACFs has decreased compared with previous years, reflecting an
increasing reliance on supplements, and is significantly less than current community food spend.
Key words: aged, budgets, malnutrition, nursing homes.
Introduction
The quality of residential aged care services is an area of regu-
lar scrutiny that will undoubtedly continue in the face of
increasing funding cuts.1,2 Aged care providers have been fac-
ing reduced profits when comparing 2016 with 2012 figures
and face increasing difficulties when working within a fund-
ing system that is prescriptive in terms of government fund-
ing.3 Financial cuts impact catering budgets and staffing and
in turn may affect the nutritional status of aged care resi-
dents.4,5 Specific to aged care, research suggests that cost
cutting reduces quality care, whereas focus on quality care
can improve cost savings.6–8 This is further supported by data
from developed countries indicating that total food spend is
associated with more nutritious dietary patterns.9
With malnutrition affecting at least one in two residents in
Australian residential aged care facilities (RACF),10,11 it is only
natural to turn attention towards obvious causes for this con-
cerning statistic. Malnutrition is associated with a cascade of
adverse outcomes, including increased risk of falls,12 pressure
injuries13 and hospital admissions,14 leading to poorer resi-
dent quality of life15 and increased health-care costs.16,17
Diminished sensory perception along with the physiology of
ageing may increase malnutrition risk.18 However, there is
emerging evidence that food insecurity or the limited ability
to access adequate, safe, tasty, nutritious and culturally appro-
priate food may also be implicated in the aetiology of malnu-
trition in residential aged care.19 Ever-tightening aged care
budgets may be impacting food insecurity and food spends
and should not be overlooked as part of the problem.
The purpose of this paper is to report current data
regarding the average expenditure on ingredients and food
in Australian RACFs.

 Methods
This was a retrospective study set across RACFs in Australia
using data collected using a pre-set survey. This pre-set sur-
vey conducted by a well recognised aged care accountancy
firm1 was developed to provide insights into the financial
performance of RACF providers. Participants self-subscribe
to be part of the quarterly survey and submit their data
every quarter, with many completing the survey on a quar-
terly basis since 2001.
The Lantern Project, a national collaboration of aged care
industry stakeholders,20 focused on improving the quality
of life of RACF residents through good nutrition, partnered
with the aged care accountancy firm to further investigate
the economic value of nutrition. In the past 2 years, in
response to work with The Lantern Project, the account-
ancy firm has requested further details in their survey
around catering costs to better understand the food spend.
This paper reports the care costs related to catering—
including crockery, cutlery—and now, more specifically,
raw food, ingredients and oral nutritional supplement costs.
Results from 1 July 2014 to 30 June 2016 are presented in
this paper. Results are sorted into bands to acknowledge
the diversity of residents represented according to care
income and acuity of resident mix (Band 1 = highest care
needs, Band 5 = lowest care needs).
Data were collected via an emailed survey, including an
excel spreadsheet for completion by the aged care provider.
Data were then imported into the accountancy firm’s pro-
prietary database. Survey reports are distributed to clients
via a secure website. The reports are provided to them in
both Excel and PDF format. These reports are provided at
RACFs and compare their data with an appropriate set of
benchmarks. The survey gives comparisons that providers
can choose to filter and compare by—including options
such as comparing against the top providers in the country
(top 25%), comparing against the top 50% and comparing
against similar size facilities. All data provided in reports are
of an aggregated nature in PDF format.
The study was reviewed and approved by the Bond Uni-
versity Human Research Ethics Committee, which provided
ethical approval for the study (project no. 0000016021).
The survey collects corporate financial data and does not
collect any information of a private or personal nature. As
part of the accountancy firm’s terms and conditions, only
de-identified data were provided to ensure the confidential-
ity of all client information. Terms of the survey give the
firm permission to publish in this format.
Data were recorded and analysed using Microsoft Excel
2010. Averages of total money spent on catering consum-
ables were calculated and presented as column graphs.
Results
The survey was completed by 817 RACFs across Australia
with the results representing 64 256 residential places
(beds) (33% of the operational places nationally) with
around 23 million bed days of data. The breakdown of
RACFs and residential places (beds) in Australia state by
state is as follows: 357 RACFs in NSW (28 251 places),
15 RACFs in ACT (1305 places), 142 RACFs in QLD
(11 865 places), 84 RACFs in Victoria (6635 places),
120 RACFs in South Australia (8880 places), 70 RACFs in
WA
(4958
places),
1
RACF
in
Northern
Territory
(65 places) and 28 RACFs in Tasmania (2297 places).
On average, AUD$8.00 was spent per resident per day
(prpd) from 1 July 2015 to 30 June 2016. The amount
spent from 1 July 2014 to 30 June 2015 was AUD
$7.52 prpd. These amounts include the cost of food and
cooking ingredients, supplements, meal replacements and
other items such as crockery, cutlery and paper goods.
Over half the aged care providers (n = 456, 56%) pro-
vided further detail of the breakdown of catering consum-
ables on food and ingredients, which decreased by AUD
$0.31
prpd
(4.9%
decrease
in
food
costs)
to
AUD
$6.08 prpd (Figure 1). Of these facilities, there were
increases in oral nutrition supplements and food replace-
ments of AUD$0.50 prpd (128% increase) and in other
consumables (predominantly a mixture of crockery, cutlery
and paper products) of AU$0.11 per bed day (28%).
The survey breaks down costs according to resident care
needs in the past 12 months (July 2015 to June 2016 period)
(Figure 2). Band 1, representing residents with the highest
care needs, showed the highest average total spend per day,
with AUD$6.29 prpd on food and ingredients and the high-
est average spend on oral nutrition supplements and other
food replacements, whereas Band 3 showed the lowest spend
in terms of food and ingredient costs at AUD$5.40 prpd.
Discussion
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to pres-
ent a snapshot of the amount Australian RACFs are spend-
ing on food and ingredients. This paper therefore provides
a foundation for future benchmarking.
Current average food and ingredient budgets in Australian
RACFs are trending downwards, with a $0.31 prpd decrease
in the last 12-month period, and appear to be significantly
lower than food budgets in the Australian community, cor-
rectional services and internationally.
To contextualise the current food and consumables budgets
for aged care residents, a comparison against food budgets
elsewhere has been explored. Raw food funding prpd man-
dated in Ontario, Canada (as of July 1st, 2016) is $8.33 Cana-
dian Dollars ($8.63 AUD)21—increasing 49.6% over the
2007–2016 period, with audits around nutritional analysis
demonstrating the need for food budget increases during this
period.22 In England, weekly food payments are £26 in 2013
(£3.70 prpd—AUD$6.12 prpd),
increasing
12.8%
over
2008–2013. Norwegian aged care budget figures show food
costs, which included food, supplements and labour, averaged
to 102.18kr prpd (AUD$20.41 prpd) in 2007 and increasing
to 128.4kr prpd (AUD$22.86 prpd) in 2013—increasing
25.7% over the 2007–2013 period. The average daily food
cost according to a US food service census in aged care
(Long-Term
Care)
facilities
was
US$6.61 prpd
(AUD

 $8.98 prpd) in 2014—up slightly from US$6.59 prpd in
2013.23
The increase in supplements and food replacements in
the present paper likely indicates that aged care providers
perhaps
choose
supplements
over
fresh
food
and
ingredients in response to unintentional resident weight
loss. Given the ongoing high rates of malnutrition in
Australian RACFs and potentially improved awareness of
the issue despite an increased supplement spend, we are
clearly not solving the expensive problem of malnutrition

 with current approaches. Strathmann demonstrated the
relationship between food budget and malnutrition risk in
2013.5 While increasing choice and food quality appears a
logical strategy and the benefits of the ‘food first’ approach
have been documented,24–26 this study demonstrates that
‘let fresh food be thy medicine’ is perhaps not the adage
currently followed in the Australian aged care industry.24–26
Increasing the aged care profit margin by reducing food
spend impacts the quality of resident care and can contrib-
ute to malnutrition rates in aged care. A recent study com-
pleted by the authors (Hugo, Isenring) has demonstrated a
reversal of trends in supplement use, and an increase in
food-first strategies has not only led to improved quality of
life measures for aged care residents but improvements in
weight and overall nutritional status and with savings in
terms of food budgets (unpublished data).
The results in this study show a reduction in food spend
in aged care over the past 12 months despite inflation fig-
ures, suggesting food costs in the community to be increas-
ing over time when looking at items such as fresh fruit,
vegetables and meals out.27
As per the Australian Bureau of Statistics (2014), in the
general community, adults younger than 35 years spend
approximately AUD$18.29 per person on food and drinks
daily.28 Young couples (average age 28 years) were the
highest spenders, with AUD$23.60 per person per day
being spent on food and drinks. Older couples were found
to be more frugal, spending AUD$17.25 per person on
food and drinks daily,29 which is still nearly thrice that of
the current aged care food budget. While cost may be con-
sidered
related
to
higher
macronutrient
requirements
amongst younger age groups, the difference is not propor-
tional to the significant variation in budget. Older couples
living the community are likely to have similar energy and
protein needs to residents living in RACFs.
Australian Corrective Services currently spend $8.25 per
prisoner per day—136% more than the RACF current fig-
ures. According to policy, ‘the prison system’s custodial
responsibility requires inmates receive a diet sufficient to
maintain them, while its public responsibility means that
this must be done on a minimal budget’.30 Even at its mini-
mal value, the budget for food per prisoner per day exceeds
the average budget prpd in Australian RACFs.
In conclusion, this study demonstrates that aged care
food budgets have decreased despite inflation, reflecting
increases in fresh produce in the community over this time.
On a per resident basis, RACFs are currently spending
nearly 1.4 times less than the current food budget for pris-
oners and nearly three times less than the Australian aver-
age of older adults living in the community. Current
Australian RACFs spends are also well below comparative
aged care food budgets internationally when compared to
Canada (1.4 times less), Norway (3.8 times less) and the
US (1.5 times less). The costly burden of malnutrition is
highest in the Australian RACF setting and will not be
helped by ongoing reductions in food spend. Discussions
through advocacy groups, such as The Lantern Project, with
the government around mandating minimum food budget
spends similar to that seen in Canada along with improved
RACF nutrition education and promotion of cost neutral
strategies to improve nutritional value of meals within
budgetary constraints are suggested as a positive move in
response to this paper. Future research should explore
whether other health outcomes improve with an increase in
food spend.
