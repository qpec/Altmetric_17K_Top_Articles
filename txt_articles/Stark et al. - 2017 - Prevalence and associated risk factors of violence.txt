Prevalence and associated risk factors of violence 
against conflict–affected female adolescents: a 
multi–country, cross–sectional study
Background Over half of displaced civilians in humanitarian emergen-
cies are children, and these settings pose unique threats to children’s 
safety with long–lasting consequences. Our study broadens the limited 
evidence on violence against adolescent girls in emergencies by esti-
mating prevalence and predictors of violence among adolescent girls 
aged 13–14 in South Kivu, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), 
and aged 13–19 in refugee camps in the Benishangul–Gumuz region 
of Ethiopia.
Methods Survey data were collected from a sample of 1296 adolescent 
girls using Computer–Assisted Personal Interview and Audio Com-
puter–Assisted Self–Interview programming. Predictors of violence 
were modeled using multivariable logistic regression.
Results The majority of adolescent girls (51.62%) reported experienc-
ing at least one form of violence victimization in the previous 12 
months: 31.78% reported being hit or beaten, 36.79% reported being 
screamed at loudly or aggressively
, and 26.67% experienced unwanted 
sexual touching, forced sex, and/or sexual coercion. Across both coun-
tries, ever having a boyfriend and living with an intimate partner were 
strong predictors of violence. Fewer years of education completed in 
DRC, and young age in Ethiopia, were also associated with reported 
victimization.
Conclusions Prevalence of violence against adolescent girls is high in 
these two conflict–affected contexts. Findings indicate a need for pro-
grams targeting younger populations, broader efforts to address differ-
ent forms of victimization, and increased recognition of intimate part-
ners and caregivers as perpetrators of violence in conflict–affected 
settings.
Violence against women and girls is a global epidemic that affects one in three 
women and one in four girls under the age of 18 [1,2]. Worldwide, females 
are at highest risk for violence during adolescence, and violence is the sec-
ond leading cause of death for adolescent girls aged 10–19 [3,4]. Risks of 
victimization are amplified by both gender and age: societies that support 
male dominance and restricted roles of females are associated with greater 
levels of violence against women, and adolescents have less access to servic-
es due to their age [5,6]. Physical, emotional, and sexual violence victimiza-
tion have been associated with negative health consequences that include 
increased risk of HIV infection, unintended pregnancy
, alcohol and substance 
abuse, depression, post–traumatic stress disorder, and suicide [7–10].

Stark et al.
A number of predictors of violence against women and girls have been identified from developed and 
developing contexts, largely from studies of intimate partner violence [11,12]. These predictors may best 
be understood within an ecological framework, which posits that there is no single factor that causes such 
violence, but that violence is a function of many factors that interact at different levels of the “social ecol-
ogy” [13]. Indeed, studies have found that demographic predictors of physical, emotional, and sexual 
violence victimization include factors at the societal level, such as unequal access to wage employment; 
at the communal level, such as norms that support gender inequity; at the interpersonal level, such as 
living with a single parent and lower socio–economic status; and at the individual level, such as female 
gender, lower educational attainment, and younger age [14–19]. Previous studies have also found behav-
ioral risks such as engagement in a relationship that includes sexual intercourse and greater number of 
romantic partners [10,20]. Additionally
, female violence victimization in childhood and adolescence con-
sistently predicts later physical and sexual victimization [21,22].
Humanitarian emergencies pose unique threats to safety
, as they may alter family structure, reduce access 
to basic rights such as health care and education, and increase engagement in risky behaviors. Humani-
tarian emergencies have resulted in an estimated 59.5 million displaced persons, half of whom are chil-
dren [23]. Previous research suggests that rates of physical and sexual violence may increase during pe-
riods of conflict and that such violence is associated with adverse health outcomes in conflict–affected 
children [24–29]. Adolescent girls have been shown to be particularly vulnerable to victimization, yet, 
until recently
, have been often overlooked in these contexts [25].
There is limited understanding of both prevalence and predictors of violence against conflict–affected 
adolescent girls. To date, studies that examine violence in conflicts (eg, communities where at least two 
armed groups have fought) have focused primarily on the health–related consequences of violence ex-
posure and on females over the age of 15 [24,30–32]. Large multi–country initiatives have been instru-
mental in building the evidence base on violence against girls in developing countries, but these initia-
tives rarely examine conflicts and do not include younger adolescents [33,34]. Understanding 
predictors of violence in such settings is critical to developing effective strategies to prevent violence 
against adolescent girls.
We analyzed data from a baseline sample of displaced, conflict–affected adolescent girls in DRC and Ethi-
opia to assess the prevalence and related risk factors of physical, emotional, and sexual violence.
METHODS
Eastern DRC has been in a state of constant conflict since 1996 and houses approximately 2.7 million 
internally displaced persons [35]. Ethiopia has been a primary destination for refugees fleeing protracted 
conflicts in Sudan and South Sudan, and as of September 2015, the area of Benishangul–Gumuz hosts 
an estimated 11 
174 South Sudanese refugees [36].
This article draws on data from a cross–sectional survey of violence and related risk factors for internally 
displaced and refugee adolescent girls between May–October 2015 in 14 sites across South Kivu, DRC, 
and in 3 refugee camps in Benishangul–Gumuz, Ethiopia. The survey was undertaken to obtain baseline 
information on girls’ experiences of violence prior to the implementation of an adolescent life skills and 
safe space program run by the International Rescue Committee in both countries [37]. In the DRC, ado-
lescent girls were excluded from the survey if they were outside of the 10–14 age range, or lacked verbal 
proficiency in Swahili or Mashi. In Ethiopia, adolescent girls were excluded if they were outside the 13–
19 age range, or lacked verbal proficiency in Funj, Regarig, Ingessana Kulelek, or Maban. Language ex-
clusion was based on the selected languages spoken by most girls in the research settings and on language 
limitations of the data collectors (in the case of Ethiopia). Age exclusion was determined at country level 
based on age groups being targeted for programming. In both countries, participants with significant cog-
nitive impairments or physical disabilities that would prevent independent completion of the question-
naire were excluded for ethical reasons.
Survey questionnaires that allowed for comparability were field–tested and used in both countries. In the 
DRC, a confidential survey
, taking approximately one hour, was administered by data collectors matched 
to participants by gender and language. Less sensitive questions were administered using Computer–As-
sisted Personal Interview (CAPI), in which interviewers asked questions verbally and recorded responses 
on a tablet. Adolescent girls answered more sensitive questions on violence and sexual health using Au-
dio Computer–Assisted Self–Interview (ACASI) programming, which allowed participants to listen to the

questions and responses through headphones, and independently select responses. Girls aged 10–12 
completed a modified survey
, with questions deemed appropriate by community interlocutors and ap-
proved by local and Western ethics bodies; these girls were excluded from our analysis, as the modified 
survey excluded some of the predictors of interest. In Ethiopia, the entire survey was administered using 
ACASI, and there were no differences in survey administration based on age. CAPI was not used in Ethi-
opia because enrollment criteria included non–written languages. A detailed description of recruitment 
and enrollment methods can be found elsewhere [37].
One thousand two hundred and ninety–six adolescent girls aged 13–19 were included in our analysis. 
The sample includes girls in “early adolescence”, defined as age 10–14, and in “late adolescence”, defined 
as age 15–19 [38]. Based on an assumption of 15% prevalence of sexual violence and inclusion of up to 
8 predictors in the model, a sample size of 170 would be needed both to determine prevalence and ana-
lyze a robust model, suggesting our sample in each country is sufficiently powered for this analysis.
Ethics approval
All study procedures were approved by the Columbia University Institutional Review Board (IRB) and by 
in–country local bodies: the Ministry of Gender in DRC and the Administration for Refugee and Return-
ee Affairs in Ethiopia. Procedures undertaken to ensure confidentiality and mitigate the potential for harm 
included extensive training on ethics and consent, private spaces for interviews, use of ACASI for sensi-
tive questions on violence victimization, and standardized debriefs that provided information about avail-
able psychosocial support services. Further details of our ethical protocols are detailed in our protocol 
paper [37].
Analysis
Independent variables were selected for analysis based on known risk factors in non–humanitarian con-
texts and formative research on vulnerability in both countries. Variables were selected to include factors 
at the individual, relational, and communal levels of Michau et al’s adapted ecological model [13]. Inde-
pendent variables included age, educational attainment, presence of biological parents in the home, liv-
ing with an intimate partner, working without payment in the last 12 months, marital status, and ever 
having a boyfriend.
Outcome variables were chosen to include different forms of violence victimization, and included binary 
questions on physical, emotional, and sexual violence occurring in the last 12 months, adapted from 
ICAST and VACS questionnaires [34,39]. Physical violence was defined as being hit or beaten. Emotion-
al violence was operationalized as being screamed at loudly or aggressively
. Sexual violence was opera-
tionalized as experiencing unwilling (forced) sex, unwanted sexual touching, or verbal coercion (using 
influence or authority to threaten or pressure respondent to have sex). Independent relationships to vio-
lence outcomes were assessed using chi–square and Fisher exact tests, where appropriate. Models were 
analyzed using multivariable logistic regression, separated by country
. All analyses were completed using 
STATA 13.1 (StataCorp LP
, College Station, USA).
RESULTS
Sample demographics
The sample included 1296 subjects aged 13–14 in DRC (N 
= 
377) and aged 13–19 in Ethiopia (N 
= 
919) 
(Figure 1). Mean age was 13.53 (standard deviation (SD) 0.50) years in DRC, and 14.61 (SD 1.51) years 
in Ethiopia. In DRC, 82.2% of participants had ever attended school, and in Ethiopia, 69.3% had ever 
attended. On average, participants had completed 4.37 (SD 2.26) years of school in DRC and 2.81 (SD 
1.93) years in Ethiopia. In DRC, the most frequently reported reason for non–enrollment in school was 
financial difficulty in paying for school or associated costs (92.0%), while domestic responsibilities were 
the most frequent reason for non–enrollment in Ethiopia (27.6%). Marriage or pregnancy was reported 
as a greater barrier to school attendance in Ethiopia (16.3%) than in DRC (0.0%).
The vast majority of participants reported living with at least one biological parent in both settings (Table 
1). Of those who provided information on marital status, 23.1% in DRC and 32.6% in Ethiopia reported 
being either married or living with someone as if married. Adolescent girls who were aged 18 or above 
were not significantly more likely to be married or living with someone as if married than adolescents

aged 13–17 (P 
= 
0.136). Approximately 17.7% of participants in DRC, and 24.5% in Ethiopia, reported 
living with an intimate partner. 20.7% (n 
= 
78) of respondents in DRC, and 30.6% in Ethiopia, reported 
ever having a boyfriend.
Prevalence of violence
Approximately half of the adolescent girls in our sample (54.4% in DRC, 50.5% in Ethiopia) reported 
experiencing at least one form of violence victimization in the previous 12 months. Of those who report-
ed experiencing at least one form of violence, 48.3% in DRC and 49.1% in Ethiopia reported poly–vic-
timization. As shown in Table 2, the most frequently reported form of violence in the last 12 months 
across both countries was emotional abuse. Younger adolescent girls (aged 13–14) in Ethiopia reported 
experiencing significantly more physical (odds ratio (OR) = 1.37, P = 0.037) and emotional violence 
(OR 
= 
1.44, P 
= 
0.012) compared with older girls (aged 15-19).

Violence against conflict–affected female adolescents
Approximately one–fourth of adolescent girls reported at least one type of sexual violence victimization 
within the previous 12 months (25.5% in DRC, 27.2% in Ethiopia). Forced sex was the most frequently re-
ported form of sexual violence (Table 2). Again, younger girls (aged 13–14) in Ethiopia were 2.09 times 
more likely than older adolescents (aged 15–19) to report unwanted sexual touching (95% CI 1.37–3.20, 
P 
= 
0.001), and 1.77 times more likely to report forced sex (95% CI 1.20–2.61, P 
= 
0.004) in the previous 
12 months.
The vast majority of adolescent girls reported that their intimate partners (boyfriends or husbands) and/or 
other family members (parents, caregivers or other relatives) were perpetrators of violence. Intimate part-
ners were the most frequently reported perpetrator of violence for nearly all forms of violence in both coun-
tries, followed closely by caregivers or relatives (Table 3). In DRC, less than 10% of adolescent girls who 
reported physical, verbal, or sexual abuse reported that perpetrators were members of an armed group and/
or officials with authority in the community
. In Ethiopia, closer to 15% of adolescent girls reported mem-
bers of an armed group and/or officials as perpetrators of physical, emotional, and sexual abuse (Table 3).
Predictors of violence
Because the participants in DRC and Ethiopia are known to have different demographic characteristics 
(mean age, ethnic group, legal status in country of residence), hypothesized predictors were first assessed 
for independent relationships to outcomes in the DRC and Ethiopia populations. To obtain a parsimoni-
ous model, predictors that were too closely related to other predictors were excluded from the model. 
Age, family structure, educational attainment, presence of biological parents in the home, living with a 
romantic partner, working without pay in the last 12 months, and ever having a boyfriend, were inde-
pendently associated with violence outcomes in DRC and Ethiopia, and placed into an adjusted model 
to examine against each violence outcome in each country
. The odds ratio, standard error, and 95% con-
fidence interval for each model are shown in Table 4 (DRC) and Table 5 (Ethiopia).
In examining physical violence in our adjusted models, adolescent girls in both countries who had ever 
had a boyfriend were significantly more likely to disclose physical violence in the previous 12 months 
than those who had never had a boyfriend (DRC adjusted OR (aOR) 
= 
2.96, P 
< 
0.001; Ethiopia aOR 
= 
4.50, 
P 
< 
0.001). In DRC alone, each additional year of school completed was associated with 0.90 lower odds 
of victimization (P 
= 
0.028). In Ethiopia, adolescent girls living with their father had 2.12 greater odds of 
disclosing physical violence in the previous 12 months, compared to those living with both biological 
parents (P 
= 
0.001). Further, each additional year of age was associated with reduced odds of physical vi-
olence in Ethiopia (aOR 
= 
0.88, P 
= 
0.038).
For emotional abuse, adolescent girls in both countries who had ever had a boyfriend had greater odds 
of reporting exposure to loud and aggressive screaming in the previous 12 months compared with those

ing with neither parent was marginally associated with greater odds of victimization, compared to living 
with both parents (aOR 
= 
2.51, P 
= 
0.048). In Ethiopia, each additional year of age was associated with a 
0.86 reduced odds in reported exposure to loud and aggressive screaming (P

, work-
ing without payment during the previous 12 months was associated with 2.79 greater odds in reported 
exposure to loud and aggressive screaming in Ethiopia (P 
= 
0.029).
Sexual violence was examined in relation to experiencing unwanted sexual touching, experiencing forced 
sex, or experiencing coerced sex through influence, authority
, threats or pressure in the previous 12 months. 
Living with an intimate partner was associated with higher odds of experiencing any form of sexual violence 
in the previous 12 months in both countries, compared to not living with an intimate partner (DRC 
aOR 
= 
2.90, P 
= 
0.003; Ethiopia aOR 
= 
1.83, P

0.005). Adolescent girls who had ever had a boyfriend also 
reported higher odds of experiencing any form of sexual violence in both countries, compared to those who 
had not had a boyfriend (DRC aOR 
= 
6.37, P 
< 
0.001; Ethiopia aOR 
= 
4.66, P 
< 
0.001). In Ethiopia, adoles-
cent girls who reported living with their father had 2.01 times higher odds of experiencing any form of sex-
ual violence than adolescents who were living with both biological parents (P 
= 
0.004).
Having had a boyfriend was significantly associated with forced sex in both countries, when adjusting for 
other variables (see Table 4 and Table 5). In DRC, living with an intimate partner was associated with 
2.70 higher odds of forced sex (P 
= 
0.009). Further, each additional year of school completed was also as-
sociated with 0.85 lower odds of forced sex (P 
= 
0.022), and each additional year of age was marginally 
associated with 0.52 lower odds of forced sex (P 
= 
0.059). In Ethiopia, each increased year of age was as-
sociated with 0.84 lower odds of forced sex (P 
= 
0.027). Adolescent girls in Ethiopia who reported living 
with their father were 2.50 times more likely to report forced sex in the previous 12 months than adoles-
cents living with both parents (P 
= 
0.001).
Having had a boyfriend was similarly associated with greater odds of unwanted sexual touching victim-
ization in the previous 12 months in both countries, compared with adolescent girls who reported never 
having had a boyfriend (DRC aOR 
= 
4.10, P 
< 
0.001; Ethiopia aOR 
=

<

age was associated with lower odds of reported unwanted sexual touching (aOR 
= 
0.84, P

0.037).
Finally, experiencing coerced sex through influence, authority, threats or pressure in the previous 12 
months was associated with living with an intimate partner in DRC (aOR

ing a boyfriend in Ethiopia (aOR 
= 
4.15, P 
< 
0.001). Ever having a boyfriend was also marginally associ-
ated with coerced sex in DRC (aOR 
= 
2.32, P 
= 
0.052). Each additional year of completed education was 
marginally associated with lower odds of coerced sex in Ethiopia (aOR 
= 
0.88, P

DISCUSSION
The prevalence of physical, emotional, and/or sexual violence victimization among adolescent girls 
(51.62%) is similar to the regional prevalence of past–year violence estimated from census data of girls 
and boys aged 2–14 (50%) and 15–17 (51%) in Africa [33].
Our study broadens the limited evidence base on predictors of violence against conflict–affected adoles-
cent girls. The fact that early age was associated with increased odds of physical, emotional, and most 
measured forms of sexual violence in Ethiopia is concerning, especially in a sample that interviewed girls 
in early adolescence. We also found a significant association between years of education completed and 
violence victimization among displaced girls aged 13–14 in the DRC, when adjusting for other factors 
[12]. Although age and educational attainment are commonly considered to be risk factors for victimiza-
tion in our contexts, our findings demonstrate that the relationship between these variables and victim-
ization may not be consistent across conflict–affected populations in the East Africa region.
Caregivers and other family members tended to perpetrate much of the reported violence against adoles-
cent girls. Similarly
, ever having a boyfriend was the most consistent predictor of sexual violence, even 
when adjusting for risk factors known to be associated with violence in other contexts. These findings 
suggest that engagement in intimate relationships may be the primary risk factor for violence victimiza-
tion among adolescents aged 13–19 in conflict settings.
Importantly
, predictors of different forms of sexual violence were not uniform, suggesting that adolescent 
girls’ vulnerability to victimization differs across forms of sexual violence and contexts. While living with 
an intimate partner was associated with coerced and forced sex in DRC for example, it was not signifi-
cantly associated with unwanted sexual touching in DRC, or with any of the three forms of sexual vio-
lence in Ethiopia.
Finally
, our findings indicate that living only with one’s father is a predictor for both physical and sexual 
violence in Ethiopia, but not DRC. While high–income countries have also documented increased risk 
of victimization for girls living with a single parent, the majority of single parents in developed contexts 
are mothers [14,15]. In our study settings, the particular pathways through which increased vulnerabil-
ity occurs are unclear, but the absence of the mother in the home increased the vulnerability of adolescent 
girls in Ethiopia. These findings suggest contextual differences in household makeup that should be fur-
ther explored.
Taken together, our results have important implications for gender–based violence prevention efforts in 
conflict settings. Increased risk of violence among younger adolescents indicates that prevention efforts 
must target younger populations, who may be at increased risk of victimization.
Our findings contradict narratives suggesting that girls are most at risk of violence at the hands of strang-
ers or military personnel in conflict settings [24]. These findings also call into question local narratives 
positing that early marriage is “protective” in conflict and helps keep girls safe from violence, or preserves 
a family’s “honor” [40,41]. Considering the evidence from our study and others on intimate partners as 
primary perpetrators of violence, even in humanitarian emergencies [42], prevention programming should 
focus on explicitly acknowledging the presence of intimate partner relationships, even in more culturally 
conservative settings. Our findings suggest that humanitarian programming may need to include intimate 
partner violence prevention strategies for adolescent girls, and work with adult community members to 
understand how some practices intended to “protect” girls, such as early marriage, may put girls at a 
greater risk for violence.
Caregivers were also identified as primary perpetrators, which supports existing calls to target key adults 
in adolescent girls’ lives, such as caregivers and other relatives, and to support positive parenting strate-
gies and communication with adolescent girls [43,44]. Such parenting programs should address the ad-
ditional vulnerabilities that girls may experience in conflict settings. While further research is warranted, 
our findings suggest that male caregivers should in particular be targeted for primary prevention efforts 
in conflict settings.

Violence against conflict–affected female adolescents
Finally
, our study has implications for efforts to document violence against adolescent girls in humanitar-
ian settings. Considering that more than 30% of adolescent girls in our study had not attended school in 
the previous year, researchers should use school–based sampling methodologies with caution.
Limitations of this study include the fact that single indicators were employed to measure physical and 
emotional violence, and potentially relevant predictors were not included in the survey such as length of 
displacement, previous exposure to war–related violence, alcohol consumption or drug use, and caregiver 
exposure to violence. Although interview methodologies were informed by constraints of the languages of 
participants, it is possible that use of different methodologies (both CAPI and ACASI in DRC, and solely 
ACASI in Ethiopia) may have contributed to some differences in predictors identified in the two contexts 
examined. To account for limitations imposed by the cross–sectional survey design, we restricted indepen-
dent variables to relationships for which temporality could be reasonably inferred. For example, informa-
tion on adolescents’ self–esteem was excluded from our model because researchers could not determine 
temporality of self–esteem and reported violence. Finally
, the study is limited to adolescent girls and care-
givers who self–selected to join the life skills program. To increase awareness of the program, recruitment 
efforts included community sensitization to the program, which were conducted throughout the villages 
in South Kivu and camps in Ethiopia. Even so, those adolescents who may be most marginalized and who 
lack the access and social capital to join the program were likely underrepresented in this study
.
CONCLUSION
Globally
, females are at highest risk for violence during adolescence, and humanitarian emergencies may 
exacerbate these vulnerabilities. Persistent gaps in knowledge of violence victimization have, to date, lim-
ited the humanitarian community’s ability to appropriately respond to and prevent violence against ado-
lescent girls in these contexts. Our study sheds light on prevalence and predictors of violence for con-
flict–affected adolescents aged 13–19 in two contexts, and offers important evidence for targeted 
programming and policy response for emergency actors, as well as guidance for other researchers work-
ing in these settings.
