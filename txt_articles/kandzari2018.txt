ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND Coronary drug-eluting stent development has introduced new metal alloys, changes in stent archi-
tecture, and bioresorbable polymers. Whether these advancements improve long-term clinical safety and efficacy has
been inconsistent in prior studies.
OBJECTIVES The authors sought to compare late-term clinical outcomes among patients treated with an ultrathin strut
(60 mm) bioresorbable polymer sirolimus-eluting stent (BP SES) and a thin strut (81 mm) durable polymer everolimus-
eluting stent (DP EES) in a large randomized trial.
METHODS BIOFLOW V (Biotronik Prospective Randomized Multicenter Study to Assess the Safety and Effectiveness of
the Orsiro Sirolimus Eluting Coronary Stent System in the Treatment of Subjects with Up to Three De Novo or Restenotic
Coronary Artery Lesions V) was an international randomized trial comparing coronary revascularization with BP SES
and DP EES regarding the primary endpoint of 12-month target lesion failure (TLF). Analysis of pre-specified 2-year
clinical outcomes was performed.
RESULTS Among 1,334 patients randomized to treatment with BP SES (884 patients) or DP EES (450 patients), the
2-year TLF rate was 7.5% for BP SES and 11.9% for DP EES (�4.33% treatment difference; 95% confidence
interval: �8.16% to �0.91%; p ¼ 0.015), driven by differences in target vessel myocardial infarction (MI) (5.3% vs.
9.5%; p ¼ 0.01) and ischemia-driven target lesion revascularization (2.6% vs. 4.9%; p ¼ 0.04). Rates of cardiac death or
MI were 7.0% versus 10.4% for BP SES and DP EES, respectively (p ¼ 0.047). Late/very late definite stent thrombosis
was statistically lower for BP SES compared with DP EES (0.1% vs. 1.0%; p ¼ 0.045).
CONCLUSIONS In a large randomized trial, significant differences in both TLF and target vessel–related MI persisted
through 2 years, favoring treatment with BP SES over DP EES. Significantly lower cumulative target lesion revasculari-
zation and late/very late stent thrombosis were also observed with BP SES. (Safety

generation
and
contemporary-
generation permanent polymer drug-eluting

ments in stent technology that have included
new metal alloys, changes in stent architec-

were
developed
with the intent to control antiproliferative
drug release during simultaneous (or subse-
quent) dissolution of the polymer material,
thereby eliminating the stimulus for chronic
inflammation that may be associated with
impaired
healing,
progressive
neointimal
proliferation, and neoatherosclerosis (1–6).
The BIOFLOW V trial (Biotronik Prospec-
tive Randomized Multicenter Study to Assess
the Safety and Effectiveness of the Orsiro
Sirolimus
Eluting
Coronary
Stent
System
in
the
Treatment of Subjects with Up to Three De Novo or

national, randomized study comparing clinical out-
comes
among
patients
undergoing
percutaneous
coronary revascularization with an ultrathin-strut (60
mm) bioresorbable polymer sirolimus-eluting stent
(BP SES) (Orsiro, Biotronik, Bülach, Switzerland) or
contemporary thin-strut (81 mm) durable polymer
everolimus-eluting stent (DP EES) (Xience, Abbott
Vascular, Santa Clara, California) (7). At 1 year, sig-
nificant differences were observed favoring treat-
ment with BP SES regarding the primary endpoint of
target lesion failure (TLF) (6.0% vs. 10.0%; p ¼ 0.04)
and target vessel–related myocardial infarction (MI)
(5.0% vs. 8.0%; p ¼ 0.02) (8). Further, in a pooled
analysis
with
2
additional
randomized
trials
comparing these stents (9,10), the Bayesian posterior
probability of noninferiority for BP SES was 100%,
and the posterior probability of superiority was 97%.
Whether late-term outcomes differ between alter-
native bioresorbable and permanent polymer DES has
been
inconsistently
demonstrated
in
previous
studies. Specific to the BIOFLOW V trial, a focus of
attention is directed to whether benefits observed at 1
year with BP SES versus DP EES are sustained over
longer
duration,
and
might
differences
emerge
regarding other clinical endpoints. To this purpose,
we report the pre-specified 2-year safety and efficacy
outcomes among patients treated with BP SES and DP
EES in the BIOFLOW V trial.

Detailed descriptions of the study design, inclusion
and exclusion criteria, methods, and 1-year results of
the BIOFLOW V trial have been previously reported
(7,8). Briefly, BIOFLOW V (NCT02389946) is a pro-
spective, 2:1 randomized, single-blinded multicenter
trial comparing BP SES and DP EES in patients un-
dergoing elective and urgent percutaneous coronary
intervention of #3

de novo native coronary artery
lesions in a maximum of 2 native target vessels. He-
modynamically stable non–ST-segment elevation MI
and acute coronary syndrome patients were eligible
for
enrollment.
Angiographic
inclusion
criteria
included a reference vessel diameter between 2.25
and 4.0 mm with lesion length #36 mm by visual
estimation. Major angiographic exclusions included
chronic total occlusions, bifurcations involving a side
branch with diameter >2.0 mm, bypass graft steno-
ses, and DES in-stent restenosis. Calcified lesions
requiring atherectomy were permitted following in-
stances
of
inadequate

likely to adhere to dual antiplatelet therapy were also
excluded. The study was approved by the institu-
tional review board or ethics committee at each

 Clinical events were assessed during hospital stay
and 30 days, 6, 12, and 24 months after the index
procedure with planned annual follow-up through 5
years. Surveillance angiography in absence of clinical
indication was not performed per protocol.
DATA MANAGEMENT. All data were submitted to a
central data coordinating facility (Baim Institute for
Clinical Research, Boston, Massachusetts). An inde-
pendent clinical events committee (Baim Institute for
Clinical Research,) adjudicated all primary and sec-
ondary
clinical endpoints blinded
to
stent type.
Further, an independent core laboratory (MedStar
Cardiovascular Research Network, Angiographic Core
Laboratory, Washington, DC) performed all related
angiographic
assessments.
Biotronik
funded
the
study and participated in site selection and manage-
ment. An independent group was responsible for
study and site management, monitoring and data
collection. The authors (D.E.K., G.D., D.E.C., R.W.)
had unrestricted access to the data and are respon-
sible for the analyses and drafting of the manuscript.
STUDY ENDPOINTS. The primary endpoint assess-
ment at 2 years was TLF, defined as the composite of
cardiac death, target vessel–related MI, or ischemia-
driven target lesion revascularization (TLR). Addi-
tional pre-specified endpoints include major adverse
cardiac
events
(MACE:
all-cause
death,
MI,
or
ischemia-driven TLR); target vessel failure (cardiac
death, target vessel–related MI, or ischemia-driven
target vessel revascularization); the individual com-
ponents of the composite endpoints; and definite or
probable stent thrombosis according to Academic
Research Consortium (ARC) criteria (11).
Periprocedural MI was defined according to the
modified
ARC
criteria
(11)
as
a
creatine
kinase-
myocardial
band
(CK-MB)
or
troponin
measured
within 48 h of the interventional procedure elevated
>3 times above the upper limit of normal. Sponta-
neous MI was defined as any CK-MB or troponin
elevation above the upper normal limit with associ-
ated ischemic symptoms, new electrocardiographic
abnormalities suggestive of ischemia, and/or new
development of imaging evidence of infarction or
regional wall motion abnormalities. Ischemia-driven
revascularization was identified as any repeat revas-
cularization of the target lesion or target vessel
associated with either: 1) ischemic symptoms and/or
an abnormal functional study and a $50% coronary
stenosis
by
quantitative
angiography;
or
2)
any
revascularization of a $70% diameter stenosis. Car-
diac death was considered any death due to any
proximate cardiac cause, unwitnessed death, or death
of unknown etiology.
STATISTICAL
ANALYSES. All
analyses
were
per-
formed in the intention-to-treat population, which
consisted
of
all
the
patients
who
underwent
randomization, regardless of the treatment received.
Kaplan-Meier estimates were also used to construct
survival curves for time-to-event variables that were
compared by means of the log-rank test as well as all
endpoints collected over the 0- to 2-year period
(Online Appendix
Q6
).
Baseline characteristics of study patients were
summarized in terms of frequencies and percentages
for categorical variables and by means with standard
deviations for continuous variables. Treatment dif-
ferences on dichotomous variables were evaluated
using Fisher’s exact tests. Categorical variables were
compared between treatments using the Cochran-
Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) Modified Ridit Scores (12),
that is, CMH of general association for nominal vari-
ables and CMH of row mean score for ordinal vari-
ables. Continuous variables were compared between
treatments using 2-sample t-tests. Additional ana-
lyses, including summaries, were conducted using
SAS
(version
9.4),
unless
otherwise
noted.
Pro-
portions were calculated using known nonmissing
values. A p value of 0.05 was established as the level
of statistical significance.
RESULTS
Among 1,334 patients randomized to treatment with
BP SES (884 patients) or DP EES (450 patients), clin-
ical follow-up was complete for 95.9% (n ¼ 848) and
95.1% (n ¼ 428) of patients treated with BP SES and
DP EES, respectively. As reported previously, both
groups had similar baseline clinical and angiographic
characteristics (Table 1). There were no significant
differences in target lesion length, vessel diameter, or
lesion characteristics, with modest, but statistically
significant, differences regarding total stent length,
number of stents, and prevalence of overlapping
stents (Table 1).
At 2 years, the significant differences observed at 1
year favoring BP SES regarding composite endpoints
of TLF, target vessel failure, and MACE were main-
tained (Table 2, Online Appendix). Specifically, TLF
was significantly lower among patients treated with
BP SES (7.5% vs. 11.9%; p ¼ 0.015, Kaplan-Meier es-
timates) (Table 2, Figure 1
Q7
), representing a modest
increase in the absolute difference in event rates
compared with 1-year events (4.3% at 2 years vs. 3.4%
at 1 year). The difference in TLF was driven princi-
pally by a significant difference in target vessel–
related MI (5.3% vs. 9.5%; p ¼ 0.01) (Table 2) in
addition to significantly lower ischemia-driven TLR in

 the BP SES cohort (2.6% vs. 4.9%; p ¼ 0.04, Kaplan-
Meier estimates) (Table 2, Figure 1). Between 1 and 2
years, a significant difference in ischemia-driven TLR
emerged between BP SES and DP EES (0.7% vs. 2.6%;
p ¼ 0.01) (Figure 2). In multivariable analysis, treat-
ment with BP SES favored most pre-specified sub-
groups regarding the 2-year occurrence of TLF with
no significant interactions observed other than age
(Figure 3).
The incidence of cardiac death or MI was also lower
in the BP SES group versus DP EES (7.0% vs. 10.4%;
p ¼ 0.047). As previously reported, the difference in
target vessel–related MI at 1 year was principally
driven by differences in periprocedural MI, in addi-
tion to a trend toward lower spontaneous MI (30 days
to 1 year) with BP SES (8). In a landmark analysis of
target vessel–related MI beyond 30 days of index
revascularization through
2 years, a significantly
higher event rate was observed among DP EES–
treated patients (0.8% vs. 2.7%; p ¼ 0.01) (Figure 2).
Overall, approximately one-third of all late MI events
(>30 days) were related to stent thrombosis. Over the
entire 2-year period, cumulative rates of both Q-wave
(0.1% vs. 1.5%; p ¼ 0.01) and non–Q-wave (5.2% vs.
8.6%; p ¼ 0.02) target vessel–related MI were also
higher with DP EES.
Multivariable analyses of 2-year occurrence of TLF,
target vessel–related MI, and ischemia-driven TLR
were performed. For each endpoint analysis, no
clinical, angiographic, or procedural characteristic
that differed between groups was identified as a
predictor of adverse outcome (Online Appendix).
Adherence to dual antiplatelet therapy at 2 years
was approximately 45% in the entire study popula-
tion and did not statistically differ between treatment
groups (45.6% BP SES vs. 45.1% DP EES; p ¼ 0.88).
The cumulative incidence of definite and definite/
probable stent thrombosis was numerically, but not
statistically, lower among patients treated with BP
SES
(0.5%
vs.
1.2%;
p
¼ 0.17)
(Table
3, Online
Appendix). However, combined late and very late
rates of both definite and definite/probable stent
thrombosis were significantly lower in the BP SES
cohort
(0.1%
vs.
1.0%;
p
¼
0.045
for
both
comparisons).
DISCUSSION
DES design and composition have evolved with spe-
cific focus to resolve existing limitations of contem-
porary stent technology related to late-term safety
and efficacy. Until recently, clinical adoption of BP
DES has been driven by several previous comparative
trials mostly showing clinical parity—but not superi-
ority—to permanent polymer DES (13–18). In the ran-
domized BIOFLOW V trial, however, the occurrence
of TLF and target vessel–related MI was significantly
lower at 1 year among patients treated with an
ultrathin-strut BP SES compared with DP EES (8). The
present analysis extends insight to the durability of
late-term comparative outcomes with this specific BP
SES, further revealing differences in additional safety
and
efficacy
endpoints.

 differences in both TLF and target vessel–related MI
persisted through 2 years favoring treatment with BP
SES over DP EES (Central Illustration). In addition, by 2
years, significantly lower ischemia-driven TLR and
late/very late stent thrombosis were also observed
with BP SES. These results indicate stability in safety
and efficacy outcomes beyond the first year of index
revascularization with ultrathin-strut BP SES leading
to continued and emerging significant differences
compared with thin-strut DP EES.
In part a consequence of noninferiority trials, a
dilemma presented by current DES studies is the op-
portunity to differentiate DES relative to infrequent
adverse event rates. Because current DES report the
most favorable efficacy and safety outcomes to date,
endpoint event rates have migrated even lower over
the past decade, further limiting the potential to
demonstrate incremental benefit with newer stent
technologies. Nevertheless, outcomes with current-
generation DES have plateaued, presenting the need
to reset expectations regarding when and for which
endpoints differences may emerge. Although dispar-
ities may not occur to the magnitude observed in
early studies comparing DES with bare-metal stents,
instead DES may be distinguished by meaningful, yet
less anticipated endpoints, such as MI rather than late
lumen loss or angiographic restenosis. In addition,

 offers greater insight to the effectiveness of DES, and
the accrual of events may amplify the ability to
distinguish outcomes between therapies. Detailed
ascertainment of events over longer duration permits
insight not only to annualized estimates of stent
thrombosis but also the persistence of late target
lesion revascularization that seems constant with
existing DES (19–22).
In the BIOFLOW V trial, the significant difference
in
the
1-year
composite
TLF
endpoint
was
principally driven by a lower risk of target vessel–
related MI associated with BP SES compared with
DP EES (8). In particular, a significant difference in
procedural-related
MI
was
observed
favoring
BP
SES,
yet
a
trend
toward
lower
spontaneous
MI
events
(>30
days
from
index
revascularization
through 1 year) was also identified. Through 2 years,
however,
both
overall
and
spontaneous
target
vessel–related
MI
event
rates
were
significantly
lower in the BP SES cohort, including significant

 (133 days) and no very late events in the BP SES
cohort.
These findings are largely consistent with recent
comparative
studies
of
ultrathin-strut
DES
and
contemporary thin-strut DES. Specifically, thinner
stent struts may permit accelerated endothelializa-
tion, reduce inflammation and arterial injury, and
decrease neointimal proliferation and thromboge-
nicity (23). Thinner strut thickness has also been
attributed to reduced side branch coverage that may
translate to lower periprocedural MI (23,24). Indeed,
the transition of stent design from stainless steel (132
mm to 140 mm) to chromium alloys (81 mm to 91 mm)
has been associated with approximate 40% to 80%
reductions in both procedural-related and late-term
MI (25–29). In the present study, a further 20-mm
strut thickness difference between BP SES and DP EES
is associated with an approximate 45% reduction in
target vessel–related MI. Similar to the BIOFLOW V
trial, the BioMime DES (Meril Life Sciences, Vapi, In-
dia;
65-mm
strut
thickness)
was
associated
with
significantly lower risk of MI compared with the thin-
strut Xience permanent polymer DES in the meriT-V
trial (30). In the SORT OUT VII (Sirolimus Eluting
ORSIRO Stent Versus Biolimus-eluting NOBORI Stent)
trial, definite stent thrombosis at 12 months was
significantly lower with the Orsiro BP SES than with a
biolimus-eluting bioresorbable polymer drug-eluting
stent (0.4% vs. 1.2%; p ¼ 0.03) having a strut thick-
ness approximately 2 times greater than the BP SES
(Nobori, Terumo Corporation, Japan), although sta-
tistical significance did not persist at 2 years (31,32).
Altogether, in a meta-analysis of randomized trials
comparing ultrathin-strut BP DES with contemporary-
generation thin-strut DES (10 trials, N ¼ 11,658),
revascularization with ultrathin-strut DES was asso-
ciated with significant reductions in TLF (relative risk
[RR]: 0.84; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.72 to 0.99)
and MI (RR: 0.80; 95% CI: 0.65 to 0.99) and numeri-
cally lower stent thrombosis (RR: 0.72; 95% CI: 0.51 to
1.01) (33).
In addition to MI and stent thrombosis events, a
lower rate of repeat TLR through 2 years observed
with BP SES in this trial also aligns with recent clinical
study. Notably, in the BIOFLOW V trial, rates of
ischemia-driven TLR at 1 year were similar between
stent groups, yet a significant difference in late TLR
beyond 1 year favoring BP SES emerged. Similarly, in
a landmark analysis of events from 1 to 2 years
follow-up
in
the
BIO-RESORT
trial,
significant
differences in both TLF and TLR emerged between
1
and
2
years
comparing
the
BP
SES
and
the
durable polymer zotarolimus-eluting stent (Resolute
Integrity; Medtronic, Dublin, Ireland; strut thickness
90 mm) (34). These findings from both trials are
hypothesis-generating given that lower TLR rates
over late-term surveillance may represent additional
benefit of very thin-strut stents (35,36) and/or poly-
mer resolution and absence of stimulus for neo-
intimal
hyperplasia
and
atherosclerotic
disease
progression that has been observed with permanent
polymers
(1,3,37,38).
Nevertheless,
inconsistency
across comparative trials and over differential time
periods is evident. Through 5-year follow-up in the
BIOSCIENCE (Sirolimus-eluting Stents With Biode-
gradable
Polymer
Versus
an
Everolimus-eluting
Stents) trial, for example, no significant differences
in major cardiovascular events were observed be-
tween patients randomized to treatment with BP SES
or DP SES (39). Such variance between trials is chal-
lenging to interpret but may be related in part or
entirely
to
differences
in
patient
and
lesion
complexity, endpoint definitions, and event adjudi-
cation or other unmeasured variables related to trial
conduct and/or patient treatment.
STUDY
LIMITATIONS. Although
statistical
signifi-
cance was demonstrated across both composite and
individual endpoints, the BIOFLOW V study was not
designed as a superiority trial, and statistical power is
limited
for
comparison
of
selected
endpoints.
Further, whether the benefit observed with BP SES is
isolated to a specific design feature or multifactorial
remains uncertain. This observation is particularly
relevant given that 1-year differences in TLF and MI
emerged during a period before complete polymer
dissolution, and stent thrombosis and TLR leveled
after 1 year in comparison to progression with the
durable polymer, thin-strut EES. A class effect among
bioresorbable polymer DES also cannot be assumed;
in the EVOLVE II trial (The EVOLVE II Clinical Trial To
Assess the SYNERGY Stent System for the Treatment
of Atherosclerotic Lesion[s]), for example, no signifi-
cant differences in outcome were observed at 1 year
or even late-term follow-up between a bioresorbable
polymer
and
durable
polymer
everolimus-eluting
stents, although differences in strut thickness be-
tween these two stent platforms is less distinct (74
mm vs. 81 mm) (18,40). Therefore, the results of the
present study suggest a new focus for DES develop-
ment relative not only to design an ultrathin-strut
stent but to further elucidate the contribution of
bioresorbable polymers.
CONCLUSIONS
Through 2 year’s follow-up in the randomized BIO-
FLOW V trial, significant differences in both TLF and
target vessel–related MI persisted favoring treatment

 with an ultrathin-strut BP SES over a contemporary-
generation thin-strut DP EES. By 2 years, signifi-
cantly lower cumulative TLR was also observed with
BP SES, driven by significant differences in late TLR
between 1 and 2 years compared with DP EES. Finally,
significantly lower late/very late stent thrombosis
was identified among patients treated with BP SES.
Altogether, these findings affirm the durability of
late-term comparative outcomes with this specific BP
SES, further revealing differences in additional safety
and efficacy endpoints. The results not only advance
a standard of comparison for new DES but also direct
attention to strut thickness and polymer composition
as key features for iterative DES development.

PERSPECTIVES
COMPETENCY IN MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE:
Through 2 years’ follow-up, differences in both target
lesion failure and target vessel–related myocardial
infarction favor use of ultrathin bioresorbable polymer
sirolimus-eluting coronary stents over contemporary
thin strut durable polymer everolimus-eluting stents.
Similar advantages extend to rates of cumulative
target lesion revascularization and late stent
thrombosis.
TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: Longer-term
studies are needed to confirm the relative safety and
effectiveness of ultrathin strut bioresorbable polymer
sirolimus-eluting coronary stents in this and other
clinical settings.
