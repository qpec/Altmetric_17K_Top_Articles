ABSTRACT
Objective STIs are the most common infections among
adults. Concurrently, pubic hair grooming is prevalent.
Small-scale studies have demonstrated a relationship
between pubic hair grooming and STIs. We aim to
examine this relationship in a large sample of men and
women.
Design We conducted a probability survey of US
residents aged 18–65 years. The survey ascertained
self-reported pubic hair grooming practices, sexual
behaviours and STI history. We defined extreme
grooming as removal of all pubic hair more than 11
times per year and high-frequency grooming as daily/
weekly trimming. Cutaneous STIs included herpes,
human papillomavirus, syphilis and molluscum. Secretory
STIs included gonorrhoea, chlamydia and HIV. We
analysed lice separately.
Results Of 7580 respondents who completed the
survey, 74% reported grooming their pubic hair, 66% of
men and 84% of women. After adjusting for age and
lifetime sexual partners, ever having groomed was
positively associated with a history of self-reported STIs
(OR 1.8; 95% CI 1.4 to 2.2), including cutaneous STIs
(OR 2.6; CI 1.8 to 3.7), secretory STIs (OR 1.7; CI 1.3 to
2.2) and lice (OR 1.9; CI 1.3 to 2.9). These positive
associations were stronger for extreme groomers
(OR 4.4; CI 2.9 to 6.8) and high-frequency groomers
(OR 3.5; CI 2.3 to 5.4) with cutaneous STIs, and for
non-extreme groomers (OR 2.0; CI 1.3 to 3.0) and low-
frequency groomers (OR 2.0; CI 1.3 to 3.1) with lice.
Conclusions Among a representative sample of US
residents, pubic hair grooming was positively related to
self-reported STI history. Further research is warranted to
gain insight into STI risk-reduction strategies.
INTRODUCTION
Pubic hair removal has become a common practice
among men and women worldwide.1 The media
has driven adoption of new grooming patterns2 3
and modern society’s definition of attractiveness,
cleanliness and feelings of femininity or masculin-
ity. As a result, our perception of genital normalcy
has changed.1 3 4
While hair removal has been shown to contribute
to increased morbidity, such as injury5 and cutane-
ous infections (eg, folliculitis2), little is known
about the relation between grooming practices and
STIs. Such a relation is plausible because the act of
grooming with razors or shavers causes epidermal
microtears, which may permit epithelial penetrance
by bacterial or viral STIs, such as human papilloma-
virus (HPV) and molluscum contagiosum.6 This
hypothesis is supported by a small-scale report of
increased
molluscum
contagiosum
acquisition
among groomers.7 On the other hand, grooming
removes the amount and length of pubic hair,
which may reduce the risk of acquiring other sexu-
ally transmitted pathogens, such as pubic lice. This
hypothesis
is
also
supported
by
a
small-scale
report.8 Finally, as pubic hair grooming is corre-
lated with an increased number of lifetime sexual
partners and is viewed as a preparatory act to
sexual engagement,1 4 9 10 it may also serve as a
marker of increased STI risk. Irrespective of the
underlying mechanism—whether a causal relation
or statistical association—understanding the pos-
sible link between pubic hair grooming and STI
acquisition could be useful for developing strategies
to reduce STI rates.
STIs remain the most commonly transmitted infec-
tion, and the USA has the highest incidence of STIs
among the industrialised countries.11 Roughly half of
Americans will acquire an STI at some point in their
lifetime.12 STIs are associated with a multitude of
sequelae, including pelvic inflammatory disease, infer-
tility
, genital-related cancers and increased rates of
HIV acquisition and transmission.11 The increasing
incidence of STIs warrants investigation into reduction
strategies beyond routine screening, media advertise-
ments and improved diagnostics.2 Prior studies have
demonstrated that the act of grooming with a razor
causes epidermal microtears, which may permit epi-
thelial penetrance by bacterial or viral STIs, such as
HPV and molluscum contagiosum.6 7 A better under-
standing of the relation between pubic hair grooming
and STI risk could lead to improved STI-reduction
strategies by identifying high-risk individuals who
would benefit from education regarding safe sex prac-
tices. Our group has previously reported that groom-
ing in conjunction with sexual orientation and sexual
role may influence STI transmission;13 however, no
large-scale, gender-balanced study has evaluated the
relation between grooming and STIs, taking into con-
sideration specific grooming practices. Our hypothesis
is that grooming is positively related to STIs, except
for pubic lice that would be reduced by hair removal.

 residing in the USA. W
e developed a questionnaire designed to
capture and characterise pubic hair grooming practices, groom-
ing injuries, sexual behaviours and STI history (see online
supplementary appendix A). The survey was conducted with the
GfK group (GfK, formerly Knowledge Networks). Details
regarding GfK study methods have previously been reported
and are briefly summarised below.14
Study participants are recruited using random probability-
based sampling to increase accuracy.15 Respondents are recruited
using address-based sampling of the US Postal Service’s delivery
sequence file. The address-based sampling estimates 97% of
households can be reached and contacted through household
mail.14 Once a survey participant is recruited, he/she receives a
notification via email to participate in a study sample. The parti-
cipants may also check their personal online member page to
participate in survey taking. The topic of the survey is given to
the participants. The participants do not see any questions from
a particular survey until they accept the survey. The topic of the
current study was ‘Personal Grooming Injuries’. GfK provides a
laptop computer and free internet service to all panel members
without access to the internet. For the current study, the panel
members received 1000 points for completing the survey, which
is the cash equivalent of $1.
A pretest survey was completed in December 2013 to ensure
face validity and participant comprehension. The final survey
was conducted in January 2014. GfK consented all participants
prior to the survey.
GfK uses statistical weighting adjustments to correct for
known
deviations.
Additional
survey errors
such
as
non-
coverage and non-response are also corrected using panel demo-
graphic poststratification weights.14 The Committee on Human
Research approved this study at the University of California—
San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA (#13-11519).
Main exposure variables
Our survey instrument queried participants’ grooming practices,
including whether they had ever groomed (yes/no) and their fre-
quency of grooming (daily, weekly, monthly, every 3–6 months
or every year). It also queried the amount of hair respondents
typically removed (trimming vs complete removal), and typical
grooming tools (non-electric razor, electric razor, wax, scissors,
electrolysis, laser hair removal, depilatories or tweezers). W
e
defined ever groomers as anyone who had groomed their pubic
hair in the past, extreme groomers as those who removed all of
their pubic hair via grooming more than 11 times per year and
high-frequency groomers as those who performed daily or
weekly pubic hair trimming. Extreme groomers and high-
frequency groomers were not mutually exclusive categorisations
as respondents may remove all of their pubic hair (extreme)
more than 11 times per year and also trim their pubic hair on a
weekly basis following hair regrowth.
Main outcome variables
The participants were queried on their history of STIs, including
the number and type of STIs. W
e categorised cutaneous STIs as
herpes, HPV
, syphilis and molluscum contagiosum, and secre-
tory STIs as gonorrhoea, chlamydia and HIV
. W
e analysed pubic
lice separately. The participants with missing or incomplete data
were excluded from the analyses (n=110, 1.5%).
Covariates
W
e included demographic factors such as age and sex, and
sexual behaviour variables such as frequency of sexual activity
and number of sexual partners annually and over a lifetime.
Statistical methods
W
e limited the analytic sample to participants who reported at
least one lifetime sexual partner to ensure that all participants
were at risk for STIs. Univariable associations between grooming
and STI history were investigated by comparing the prevalence
of each individual STI and STI type by grooming status and
practices, using χ2 or Fisher’s exact test, as appropriate.
Multivariable logistic regression models were then created to
measure associations adjusting for confounders a priori (age and
number of lifetime sexual partners). A data analysis was per-
formed with Stata V
.13.0 (StataCorp, College Station, T
exas,
USA). p Values ≤0.05 were considered statistically significant.
RESULTS
Grooming habits
In total, 7580 subjects completed the survey out of 14 409
sampled (52.5%). Respondent breakdown by sex was 56% men
and 44% women. Of the 7580, a total of 7470 respondents
reported at least one lifetime sexual partner.
The majority of participants (74%) reported a history of
grooming their pubic hair (66% men and 84% women). Of
those who groomed, 17% were extreme groomers and 22%
were high-frequency groomers; 10% of extreme groomers were
also high-frequency groomers (table 1). Overall, groomers were
younger than non-groomers (mean age and SD 43±13 years vs
50±13 years,
respectively).
Groomers
reported
a
greater
number of annual (mean, SD 1.9±21.7) and total lifetime
sexual partners (mean, SD 16.5±60.1) compared with non-
groomers (mean, SD 1.2±2.1 and 13.8±52.3, respectively).
Groomers also reported more frequent weekly and daily sexual
activity (53% and 4%, respectively) compared with non-
groomers (43% and 3%, respectively). Considering only partici-
pants who groomed, those who were extreme or high-frequency
groomers were more likely to be younger and female, and to
report more frequent sexual activity than those who were non-
extreme or low-frequency groomers. Extreme groomers also
reported a greater number of annual and total lifetime sexual
partners than other types of groomers (table 1).
Grooming tools
The types of grooming tool used varied by sex. A greater per-
centage of male groomers used an electric razor compared with
female groomers (42% vs 12%). Non-electric razor usage was
more common among women compared with men (61% vs
34%). Scissor usage was equally prevalent among both male and
female groomers (19% vs 18%, respectively). W
omen reported
using wax more often than men (5% vs 0%, respectively).
Electrolysis, laser hair removal and usage of tweezers were rare
among both male and female groomers.
Grooming and STIs
Thirteen per cent of participants (n=943) reported a history of
STI(s), 11% men and 15% women (table 2). A greater proportion
of groomers reported a lifetime history of STIs than non-groomers
(14% vs 8%, respectively, p<0.01). Among groomers only
, those
who reported extreme grooming were more likely to report a life-
time history of STIs than those who reported non-extreme groom-
ing (18% vs 14%, respectively, p<0.01), whereas no differences
were observed between high-frequency and low-frequency groo-
mers (15% vs 14%, respectively, p=0.92) (table 2).

 Grooming and cutaneous STIs
Groomers were more likely to report a history of cutaneous STIs
when compared with non-groomers (7% vs 2%, respectively,
p<0.01). This positive association was observed for herpes (3%
vs 1%, respectively, p<0.01), HPV (3% vs 1%, respectively,
p<0.01) and syphilis (1.3% vs 0.7%, respectively, p=0.05), but
not for molluscum contagiosum, although the number of partici-
pants who reported molluscum was low (table 2). Stronger posi-
tive associations were observed for extreme groomers when
compared with non-extreme groomers with a history of cutane-
ous STIs and for individuals with histories of herpes and HPV
(table 2). The stronger positive associations were also observed
for high-frequency groomers compared with low-frequency
groomers with histories of cutaneous STIs and for individuals
with histories of HPV (table 2).
Grooming and secretory STIs
Groomers were more likely to report a history of secretory
STIs compared with non-groomers. This positive association
was observed for chlamydia and HIV
, but was not statistically
significant for gonorrhoea. Extreme groomers compared with
non-extreme groomers were more likely to report a history of
secretory STIs, although this did not reach statistical signifi-
cance. Extreme groomers were significantly more likely to
report a history of chlamydia than non-extreme groomers.
Finally, high-frequency groomers were significantly less likely
to
report
a
history
of
gonorrhoea
than
low-frequency
groomers.
For pubic lice, groomers were more likely to report a history
of this STI than non-groomers, but this association was limited
to non-extreme and low-frequency groomers.

Clinical
 Multivariate analysis
After adjustment for age and number of lifetime sexual partners,
ever having groomed remained positively associated with histor-
ies of any STIs (OR 1.8; 95% CI 1.4 to 2.2), cutaneous STIs (OR
2.6; CI 1.8 to 3.7), secretory STIs (OR 1.7; CI 1.3 to 2.2) and
pubic lice (OR 2.0; CI 1.25 to 2.91) when compared with non-
grooming. The stronger positive associations for extreme groom-
ing (OR 4.41; CI 2.9 to 6.8) and high-frequency grooming (OR
3.6; CI 2.3 to 5.4) with cutaneous STIs also persisted when com-
pared with non-grooming. Finally, for pubic lice, non-extreme
grooming (OR 2.0; CI 1.3 to 3.0) and low-frequency grooming
(OR 2.0; CI 1.3 to 3.1) remained positively associated with these
STIs. Extreme grooming (OR 1.5; CI 0.8 to 3.0) and high-
frequency grooming (OR 1.4; CI 0.8 to 2.6) were not associated
with pubic lice when compared with non-grooming (table 3).
DISCUSSION
Knowing the burden STIs have upon society, our primary aim
was to evaluate the relation between grooming practices and
STIs among a nationally representative sample of US residents.
To our knowledge, this is the first national survey to investigate
this possible relation. W
e found that a greater proportion of
groomers reported a history of STIs than non-groomers. This
positive relation was observed for all STIs, including cutaneous
STIs, secretory STIs and pubic lice. However, the nature of
these associations varied by grooming practices and type of STI.
For cutaneous STIs, a dose–response was observed, whereby
extreme groomers had a greater lifetime prevalence of any cuta-
neous STIs, herpes and HPV
, and high-frequency groomers had
a greater lifetime prevalence of any cutaneous STIs and HPV
.
These patterns were less clear for secretory STIs. Although
extreme groomers did not have a significant difference in their
lifetime prevalence of secretory STIs overall, this association
varied widely across individual STIs. High-frequency groomers
were also less likely to report gonorrhoea than low-frequency
groomers.
Finally,
for
pubic
lice,
the
positive
association
between grooming and lice was limited to non-extreme and low-
frequency
groomers.
As
expected,
after
adjustment,
both
extreme grooming and high-frequency grooming were not asso-
ciated with pubic lice when compared with non-grooming.
Several possible mechanisms may explain our findings. First,
grooming may cause epidermal microtears, which may increase
the risk of STIs, particularly cutaneous, viral STIs. This mechan-
ism was recently proposed for grooming and molluscum conta-
giosum.7 This mechanism is also consistent with our observed
dose–response relation between grooming and cutaneous STIs,
as more extreme and/or frequent grooming should, in theory,
result in a greater number and frequency of epidermal micro-
tears and thus a greater risk of cutaneous STIs. The impact that
HPV vaccine has on groomers and cutaneous STIs is unknown.
As a second possible explanation for our findings, shared use of
grooming tools may lead to STI transmission and a positive rela-
tion between grooming and STIs. For instance, there has been
one report of HIV transmission among brothers sharing a razor
blade;17 however, transmission of HIV via non-sexual, non-
needle sharing, household contacts of persons with HIV is
extraordinarily rare.18 With regard to gonorrhoea and chla-
mydia, the most common secretory STIs among groomers, these
bacterial infectious agents have not been reported on inanimate
object(s). Therefore, we believe that shared use of grooming
tools is highly unlikely to explain our positive findings. As a
third possible explanation for our findings, individuals who
groom may be more likely to engage in risky sexual behaviours
than those who do not groom. Although we adjusted our ana-
lyses for lifetime sexual partners, it is still possible that our find-
ings may have been confounded by risky sexual behaviours.
Finally, several mechanisms may work together to explain our
findings. For instance, our stronger findings for cutaneous STIs
may be explained by both microtears and residual confounding.
Our findings for secretory STIs may be explained solely by
residual confounding, for example, unmeasured sexual behav-
iour practices, self-reporting biases and/or STI recall biases. The
positive relations between pubic lice and grooming, which were
limited to non-extreme and low-frequency grooming, may
reflect residual confounding masking a likely protective associ-
ation between grooming and lice acquisition. This type of pro-
tective association was observed in a prior report and was
attributed to removal of the hairs where louse eggs can hatch.8
Lastly, reverse causality may explain all associations whereby
respondents become groomers following a recent STI. Future,

Clinical
 prospective studies with more detailed STI risk information will
be necessary to disentangle these possible mechanisms. Beyond
epidemiological correlation, the clinical impact to which groom-
ing affects STIs remains to be seen.
Irrespective of the ultimate underlying mechanisms, we
believe that a better understanding of the relation between
grooming and STIs may be useful for STI risk reduction. For
instance, if our positive findings reflect a statistical correlation
between grooming and STI acquisition, this information could
be used to target STI risk prevention. Future, prospective
studies examining this correlation are warranted. Grooming is
known to be a surrogate for sexual activity1 2 and could prompt
physicians to inquire about safer sex practices if evidence of
grooming is seen on physical examination. Alternatively, if
grooming-induced epidermal microtears are found to increase
STI risk, then groomers could be counselled to reduce their
amount or frequency of grooming, or to delay sexual activity
after grooming, to allow the skin to re-epithelise. Finally, if
grooming is found to protect against lice, individuals at risk for
pubic lice could be counselled to remove their pubic hair.
Our study has limitations. First, it was cross-sectional; there-
fore, we were not able to determine the timing of grooming
relative to STI acquisition to inform causation. Second, we did
not assess safe sex practices (eg, condom usage) of respondents.
To control for STI risk, we used the number of lifetime sexual
partners as a surrogate for risky sexual behaviour, but more
detailed information should be collected in future studies. Our
survey assessed intimate topics that may have inhibited honest
responses. Our exposure and outcome were both sensitive and
self-reported, which limits reliability. The impact of underdiag-
nosed STIs is unknown. Furthermore, our findings may have
been influenced by recall bias if respondents who were willing
to report their grooming experiences honestly. Certain STIs
inherently have a greater probability of recall bias (eg, syphilis)
and have varying degrees of prevalence across populations,
which may account for the differential in STI self-reporting.
Conclusions
Roughly 13% of groomers from our nationally distributed
survey reported a history of STIs. Pubic hair grooming was posi-
tively correlated with a lifetime history of cutaneous STIs, secre-
tory STIs and pubic lice. Future, prospective studies are
warranted to confirm our cross-sectional findings and to eluci-
date the underlying mechanisms for their insight into new STI
risk-reduction strategies. Depending on the underlying mechan-
isms, these strategies might take the form of delayed sexual
activity following grooming to allow re-epithelialisation and
sexual risk education for groomers.

Key messages
▸ In a large, nationally representative sample of US residents,
intensity and frequency of pubic hair grooming were
positively related to STI history.
▸ Specifically, herpes, human papillomavirus, syphilis and
molluscum were more common among groomers after
adjusting for age and number of lifetime sexual partners.
▸ Clinical awareness of grooming behaviours may provide
insight into STI history.
