Maternal Preferences for Vitamin D Supplementation  
in Breastfed Infants
ABSTRACT
Daily vitamin D supplementation is recommended for breastfed infants, but alter-
native methods include enriching breast milk with vitamin D through maternal 
supplementation or intermittent high-dose vitamin D. We determined maternal 
preferences for vitamin D supplementation in 140 mothers with exclusively 
breastfed infants, and 44 who used both breast and formula milk. Only 101 
(55%) supplemented their infants with vitamin D. One hundred sixty (88%) pre-
ferred supplementing themselves rather than their infants, and 102 (57%) pre-
ferred daily to monthly supplementation. Safety was most important in choosing 
a method of supplementation. Taking maternal preferences into consideration 
may improve adequate intakes of vitamin D in breastfed infants.

INTRODUCTION
V
itamin D deficiency has become a global public health concern. 
Nutritional rickets is the most established consequence, and an 
increasing incidence of rickets has been observed in developed 
countries.1,2 In one study up to 18% of US children were vitamin D defi-
cient, and 1% had severe deficiency.3
Breastfed infants are vulnerable to vitamin D deficiency because of the 
low concentration of vitamin D in breast milk. The American Academy of 
Pediatrics (AAP) recommends supplementation of breastfed, partially breast-
fed, and bottle-fed infants with vitamin D at 400 IU/d, beginning in the first 
few days of life.4 Adherence to this recommendation, however, is poor.5
Several studies have explored alternative methods of supplementation. 
Breast milk can be enriched with vitamin D through daily or intermittent 
high-dose maternal supplementation to meet infants’ vitamin D require-
ments.6,7 Alternatively, oral vitamin D, 50,000 IU every 2 months, can be 
given to healthy infants with routine vaccinations to prevent vitamin D 
deficiency.8
Little is known about maternal preferences for different methods of 
vitamin D supplementation. Our aim was to assess maternal practices and 
preferences for vitamin D supplementation of their infants in primary care.
METHODS
Mothers seeking care with infants for either 2-month or 4-month well-
child visits were surveyed regarding vitamin D supplementation. Eligible 
mothers were aged 18 years and older, spoke English, and had an infant 
aged between 6 weeks and 5 months that was receiving primary care at 
Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. Practices included 1 urban site, 2 
suburban sites, and 1 rural site. 
We collected data regarding infant feeding practices, vitamin D 
supplementation, and maternal preferences for the mode of vitamin D 
supplementation. Response options included either supplementation of 
the baby or mother with vitamin D and either daily or monthly high-dose

vitamin D. Mothers rated the importance of conve-
nience, safety, being most natural, and cost in choosing 
between options for vitamin D supplementation. 
The survey questionnaires were distributed to the 
mothers in the urban site in October 2013. Question-
naires were mailed to mothers at all 4 sites in Novem-
ber and December 2013. A second mailing was sent 
to nonrespondents 30 days later. The questionnaires 
had no patient-identifying information and included 
instructions not to complete it twice.
The Mayo Clinic Institution Review Board 
approved the study.
RESULTS
A total of 601 questionnaires were mailed, 438 non-
respondents were sent a second mailing, and 31 com-
pleted the survey during well-child visits. In all, 236 
mothers completed the survey. We report results for 
the 140 mothers with exclusively breastfed infants and 
44 who used both breast and formula milk. Charac-
teristics of the mothers and their infants are shown in 
Table 1.
Of the mothers, 138 (76%) were taking a mul-
tivitamin with vitamin D. Only 101 (55%) had 
supplemented their infants with vitamin D in the pre-
ceding week (median 5 d/wk), and 77 infants (42%) 
received the 400 IU recommended. The proportion 
of infants receiving supplementation did not vary 
by age (P = .46). A total of 134 (73%) reported that 
their clinician had recommended infant vitamin D 
supplementation, and these mothers were more likely 
to supplement their infants with vitamin D (OR = 8.3; 
95% CI, 3.8-18). The 11 nonwhite mothers (4.9%) 
were more likely to supplement infants with vitamin 
D than white mothers (P = .04). Mothers rated ease 
of administering vitamin D supplementation as 4 on 
a scale of 1 to 5 (with 5 being easiest), but 6 of 105 
respondents (5.7%) found administration burdensome 
(rated 1 or 2).
The great majority of breastfeeding mothers 
(88.4%) preferred supplementing themselves rather 
than their infants with vitamin D. Most expressed a 
desire for a daily supplementation (57%) compared 
with monthly supplementation. In rating the impor-
tance of factors informing their choices, mothers rated 
safety highest, and cost was rated lowest. First-time 
mothers and those who had additional children had 
similar preferences and value ratings.
Regarding reasons for not supplementing infants 
with vitamin D (Table 2), many mothers indicated lack 
of knowledge about supplementation, some believed 
that breast milk provided infants with adequate vita-
min D, and others chose not to supplement because of 
inconvenience or their infant’s apparent dislike of the 
supplement.

DISCUSSION
Less than one-half the infants in this study met the 
AAP recommendation for vitamin D supplementation 
of breastfed and bottle-fed infants. More mothers took 
a vitamin D supplement than provided their infants 
with a supplement, and a minority of breastfeeding 
mothers adequately supplemented their infants. 
Most breastfeeding mothers preferred supplement-
ing themselves rather than their infants, and most 
preferred daily rather than monthly supplementation. 
Advantages of maternal rather than infant supple-
mentation include increased ease of administration, 
simultaneous mother and infant supplementation, and 
avoidance of potential toxicity to the infant from dos-
ing errors.9,10
High-dose maternal vitamin D supplementation 
(4000-6400 IU/d or a single monthly dose of 150,000 
IU) can sufficiently enrich breast milk in nursing moth-
ers, preventing vitamin D deficiency in their infants 
without evident toxicity.6,7 Mothers take a prenatal 
vitamin after delivery, so additional vitamin D could be 
incorporated in the maternal supplementation routine. 
Our findings are limited by our study population 
of predominantly white mothers and might not apply 
to populations that are nonwhite or at a greater risk of 
vitamin D deficiency. Additionally, mothers who com-
pleted the questionnaire may have practices and prefer-
ences that are different from those of nonrespondents. 
Promotion of breastfeeding as a complete nutri-
tional source could be facilitated by providing 
adequate maternal vitamin D supplementation to 
breastfeeding mothers. Maternal choice of mode of 
supplementation may help ensure adequate vitamin D 
status for infants.
