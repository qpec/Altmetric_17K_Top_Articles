Abstract
Importance—As men age, they experience decreased serum testosterone concentrations, 
decreased bone mineral density (BMD), and increased risk of fracture.
Objective—To determine whether testosterone treatment of older men with low testosterone 
increases volumetric BMD (vBMD) and estimated bone strength.
Design, Setting, and Participants—Placebo-controlled, double-blind trial with treatment 
allocation by minimization at 9 US academic medical centers of men 65 years or older with 2 
testosterone concentrations averaging less than 275 ng/L participating in the Testosterone Trials 
from December 2011 to June 2014. The analysis was a modified intent-to-treat comparison of 
treatment groups by multivariable linear regression adjusted for balancing factors as required by 
minimization.
Interventions—Testosterone gel, adjusted to maintain the testosterone level within the normal 
range for young men, or placebo gel for 1 year.
Main Outcomes and Measures—Spine and hip vBMD was determined by quantitative 
computed tomography at baseline and 12 months. Bone strength was estimated by finite element 
analysis of quantitative computed tomography data. Areal BMD was assessed by dual energy x-
ray absorptiometry at baseline and 12 months.
Results—There were 211 participants (mean [SD] age, 72.3 [5.9] years; 86% white; mean [SD] 
body mass index, 31.2 [3.4]). Testosterone treatment was associated with significantly greater 
increases than placebo in mean spine trabecular vBMD (7.5%; 95% CI, 4.8% to 10.3% vs 0.8%; 
95% CI, −1.9% to 3.4%; treatment effect, 6.8%; 95% CI, 4.8%-8.7%; P < .001), spine peripheral 
vBMD, hip trabecular and peripheral vBMD, and mean estimated strength of spine trabecular

 bone (10.8%; 95% CI, 7.4% to 14.3% vs 2.4%; 95% CI, −1.0% to 5.7%; treatment effect, 8.5%; 
95% CI, 6.0%-10.9%; P < .001), spine peripheral bone, and hip trabecular and peripheral bone. 
The estimated strength increases were greater in trabecular than peripheral bone and greater in the 
spine than hip. Testosterone treatment increased spine areal BMD but less than vBMD.
Conclusions and Relevance—Testosterone treatment for 1 year of older men with low 
testosterone significantly increased vBMD and estimated bone strength, more in trabecular than 
peripheral bone and more in the spine than hip. A larger, longer trial could determine whether this 
treatment also reduces fracture risk.
As men age, they experience decreases in serum testosterone concentration.1,2 They also 
experience decreases in areal bone mineral density (aBMD),3-5 volumetric bone mineral 
density (vBMD),6 and estimated strength6 and an increase in fractures.7 When men of any 
age develop severely low testosterone due to known disease, their BMD decreases8-11 and 
fractures increase.12,13 In men who are frankly hypogonadal, testosterone treatment 
improves BMD,14-16 trabecular architecture,17 and mechanical properties.18
Prior studies of the effect oftestosterone treatment on bone in older men, however, have not 
been conclusive.19-22 In 1 placebo-controlled study, testosterone treatment did not improve 
spine BMD overall, but in a regression model, lower serum testosterone predicted a 
significantly greater effect of testosterone treatment on spine BMD.19 Another study 
demonstrated a significant increase in spine and hip BMD in testosterone-treated men, but 
supraphysiologic doses of testosterone were used.21
We report here the results of the Bone Trial of the Testosterone Trials (T-Trials), a group of 7 
coordinated trials of the effects of testosterone treatment of older men with low testosterone 
concentrations.23,24 The purpose of the Bone Trial was to determine whether testosterone 
treatment would improve vBMD and estimated bone strength.
Methods
Study Design
The T-Trials were conducted at 12 US sites; 9 of them participated in the Bone Trial. The 
study design has been described.23 To enroll in the T-Trials overall, participants had to 
qualify for at least 1 of the 3 main trials.24 If they qualified, they could participate in the 
Bone Trial. Participants were randomly assigned to receive testosterone or placebo gel 
double-blindly for 1 year. This report describes the efficacy results for the Bone Trial.
The protocol (Supplement 1) was approved by the institutional review boards of all 
participating institutions. All men provided written, informed consent. A data safety 
monitoring board approved the protocol and monitored unblinded safety data.
Participants
Participants were recruited and screened as described.25 Respondents were screened first by 
telephone interview and then during 2 clinic visits. To be included in the T-Trials, men had 
to be at least 65 years old, have subjective and objective evidence of impaired sexual or 
physical function or reduced vitality, and have a serum testosterone concentration on 2

 morning specimens that averaged less than 275 ng/dL (to convert to nanomoles per liter, 
multiply by 0.0347). Potential participants were excluded if they were at increased risk of 
conditions that testosterone treatment might exacerbate. Potential participants for the Bone 
Trial were also excluded if they were taking a medication known to affect bone, except for 
calcium and over-the-counter vitamin D preparations; if they did not have at least 1 
evaluable lumbar vertebra; or if they had a dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) T-score 
at any site of less than −3.0.
Treatment
We allocated participants to receive testosterone or placebo gel by minimization.26,27 
Balancing variables included participation in each of the main trials, clinical site, 
testosterone concentration greater than or less than 200 ng/dL, and age older or younger than 
75 years. The testosterone preparation was AndroGel 1% in a pump bottle (AbbVie). 
Placebo gel was similar. The initial dose was 5 g daily. Serum testosterone concentration 
was measured at months 1, 2, 3, 6, and 9 in a central laboratory (Quest Clinical Trials), and 
the dose of testosterone gel was adjusted after each measurement to attempt to keep the 
concentration within the normal range for young men. To maintain blinding when the dose 
was adjusted in a participant taking testosterone, the dose was changed simultaneously in a 
participant taking placebo by a staff person in the Data Coordinating Center according to a 
prespecified algorithm; no site personnel knew the treatment allocation.
All participants were given and instructed to take 1 tablet containing 600 g of elemental 
calcium and 400 units of vitamin D3 twice a day with meals.
Assessments
At the end of the trials, the serum concentrations of testosterone and estradiol were 
measured by liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectroscopy and free testosterone by 
equilibrium dialysis in the Brigham Research Assay Core Laboratory, Boston, 
Massachusetts.24 Samples from baseline and months 3, 6, 9, and 12 from each participant 
were measured in the same assay run.
Efficacy outcomes in the Bone Trial were assessed at baseline and after 12 months of 
treatment. The primary efficacy outcome was percent change from baseline in vBMD of 
trabecular bone in the lumbar spine, as assessed by means of quantitative computed 
tomography (QCT). Volumetric BMD was chosen as the main method of assessment rather 
than aBMD by DXA because it is not artifactually influenced by osteophytes and aortic 
calcification4,28 and because it can distinguish between trabecular bone, which testosterone 
affects primarily, and cortical bone.18 Secondary outcomes were vBMD of peripheral bone 
and whole bone of the lumbar spine and trabecular, peripheral, and whole bone of the hip; 
estimated strength of the same sites by finite element analysis (FEA) from computed 
tomographic (CT) data; and aBMD of the spine and hip by DXA.
All T-Trials participants were asked about fractures every 3 months during treatment and at 
6 and 12 months afterwards. An independent adjudicator reviewed radiographic reports of 
all reported fractures and adjudicated without knowledge of treatment allocation.

 Computed tomographic scans of the lumbar spine and the hip were performed at baseline 
and month 12. The QCT reading center trained the technicians at each of the 9 clinical sites 
to ensure a consistent imaging technique. The spine scan extended from mid-T12 to mid-L4; 
L1 and L2 measurements were used preferentially, but if not assessable, L3 was used; the 
values of 2 vertebrae were averaged. The hip scan extended from 1 cm above the femoral 
heads to 2 cm below the lesser trochanters; both hips were used if assessable and the results 
averaged. Each image included an external bone mineral phantom (Mindways Software) 
beneath the participant for calibration. A second phantom (Mindways) was scanned monthly 
to detect any field nonuniformity or scanner drift. The mean (range) coefficient of variation 
for all scanners was 0.23% (0.13%-0.29%). This phantom was also used for cross-
calibration for the 12 participants at 2 sites whose scans were acquired using different 
scanners at the baseline and 12-month visits. A third phantom (European Spine Phantom, 
QRM GmbH) was used to verify cross-calibration.
Image processing, vBMD measurements, and finite element strength analyses were 
performed at a central site (O.N. Diagnostics), blinded to treatment group, by analysis of the 
CT scans using VirtuOst software. O.N. Diagnostics also maintained quality control of the 
CT data collection. Construction of the finite element models has been described.29-31 For 
the vertebrae, trabecular vBMD was measured using an elliptical region of interest in the 
trabecular centrum (eFigure 1 in Supplement 2). Whole bone and peripheral vBMD were 
defined, respectively, as the mean vBMD for the whole vertebral body, and the outer 2 mm 
of bone, which included the cortex and neighboring trabecular bone. To measure vertebral 
strength, uniform axial compression was applied virtually to the finite element model 
through a layer of bone cement (eFigure 1 in Supplement 2); the whole bone strength was 
defined as the force at 2% deformation. Trabecular strength was similarly measured after 
removing the outer 2 mm of bone, and peripheral strength was calculated as whole-bone 
strength minus trabecular strength.
For the femur, whole-bone vBMD was measured as the mean density of the entire model. 
Each model was then divided into a trabecular compartment (all bone with an apparent 
density less than 1 mg/cm3 and more than 3 mm from the periosteum) and a peripheral 
compartment (all bone not in the defined trabecular compartment containing the cortex and 
some adjacent trabecular bone) (eFigure 1 in Supplement 2). Trabecular and peripheral 
vBMD were measured as the mean vBMD of their respective compartments. Femoral 
strength was measured by simulation of a sideways fall. Trabecular strength was similarly 
measured after assigning 2 reference densities to the peripheral compartment; and peripheral 
strength was measured after assigning a single reference density to the trabecular 
compartment.
Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry scans of the lumbar spine and hip were obtained at the 
baseline and 12-month visits using Hologic densitometers. Quality control of DXA was 
centrally monitored by the University of California San Francisco Coordinating Center, 
DXA QA Group. The DXA operators at each of the 9 sites were certified at the beginning of 
the trial. Scans were analyzed locally, using the same software version at baseline and 
follow-up, and sent to the Coordinating Center for incorporation into a central database.

 Flagged scans and a random sample of scans were reviewed for quality. Longitudinal 
performance of densitometers was monitored with regular scanning of a spine phantom.
Statistical Analyses
Sample size was based on a prior study in hypogonadal men that showed a mean (SD) 
increase in trabecular vBMD of 14% (3%) over 18 months of testosterone treatment.14 We 
posited a 9% improvement over 12 months, assuming no change in the placebo group and 
the same standard deviation. To achieve 90% power with a 2-sided significance level of .05, 
we required 172 men; we targeted 200 men to compensate for non-adherence and dropout.
Analyses followed the intention-to-treat principle; men allocated to testosterone were 
compared with men allocated to placebo, regardless of adherence or T level achieved. All 
participants who had baseline and month 12 scans were included in the analyses. Each 
outcome reported here was prespecified. The effect of testosterone compared with placebo 
on percent change in bone outcomes was evaluated by multivariable linear regression, 
adjusted for balancing factors as required for the analysis of interventions allocated by 
minimization. Multiple imputation was used to assess the influence of missing month 12 
scans on the primary outcome analysis. Imputation models included demographic and 
clinical variables listed in Table 1. The Markov chain Monte Carlo method was used to 
impute missing values. All analyses were conducted at a 2-sided significance level of .05.
Multivariable linear regression models with interactions of treatment and baseline factors 
were used to examine whether the magnitude of the effect of testosterone treatment differed 
according to baseline vBMD, total serum testosterone level, or estradiol level. Unadjusted 
linear regression was used to determine, in men in the testosterone arm, the association of 
the percent change in trabecular vBMD of the lumbar spine from baseline to month 12 with 
absolute change in total testosterone and estradiol from baseline to month 12.
Analyses did not adjust for multiple comparisons because the bone outcomes were likely 
highly correlated, making such adjustments overly conservative.
Results
Participants and Treatment
Recruitment began in December 2011. Targeted enrollment was completed in June 2013, 
and treatment was completed in June 2014. Of the 295 men who enrolled in one of the main 
T-Trials, at the 9 clinical trial sites from the inception of the Bone Trial, 211 met Bone Trial 
entry criteria and enrolled (Figure 1). Allocation to testosterone or placebo treatment was the 
same for each participant as in the T-Trials overall. One hundred eightynine participants 
(90%) completed 12 months of treatment and had analyzable baseline and 12-month scans. 
Noncompletion was more frequent among men in the placebo arm (16 [15.8%] placebo, 6 
[5.5%] testosterone; P = .01); demographic characteristics, baseline hormone levels, and 
baseline bone strength and density measures did not differ between completers and 
noncompleters.

 At baseline, the participants had low serum testosterone concentrations for young men 
(Table 1). Baseline characteristics in the 2 treatment arms were similar, including total and 
free testosterone levels and aBMD. The mean T scores for the spine and hip were not low 
(Table 1). Mean body mass index, alcohol consumption, and serum estradiol level were 
slightly higher in the placebo-treated men.
Treatment with testosterone increased the median serum concentrations of total testosterone, 
free testosterone, and estradiol to within the normal ranges for young men (Figure 2).
Efficacy
Testosterone treatment increased mean lumbar spine trabecular vBMD (primary outcome) 
by 7.5% (95% CI, 4.8% to 10.3%), compared with 0.8% (95% CI, −1.9% to 3.4%) by 
placebo (Figure 3A and Table 2), a difference of 6.8% (95% CI, 4.8% to 8.7%; P < .001; r2 
= 0.26). The mean difference was somewhat less (4.0%; 95% CI, 3.0% to 5.0%) in 
sensitivity analyses for missing month 12 scans but still significant (P < .001).
The magnitude of the treatment effect on trabecular vBMD of the spine did not vary 
significantly by baseline total testosterone, estradiol, or vBMD. The magnitude of the 
percent increase in spine trabecular vBMD from baseline to month 12 in testosterone-treated 
men, however, was significantly associated with changes in total testosterone (β = 0.01, ρ = 
0.25, P = .01) and estradiol (β = 0.17, ρ = 0.37, P < .001) (eAppendix 1 and eFigure 2 in 
Supplement 2). A 200 ng/dL increase in testosterone was associated with a 6.1% increase in 
trabecular vBMD, and a 15 pg/mL increase in estradiol was associated with a 6.3% increase.
Testosterone treatment also increased peripheral and whole-bone vBMD of the spine and 
trabecular, peripheral, and whole-bone vBMD of the hip (Figure 3A and Table 2). The 
magnitudes of the increases were less in the hip than in the spine but still statistically 
significant.
Based on FEA of QCT data, testosterone treatment also increased estimated bone strength. 
Testosterone treatment increased estimated strength of spine trabecular bone by 10.8% (95% 
CI, 7.4% to 14.3%), compared with 2.4% (95% CI, −1.0% to 5.7%) in placebo-treated men 
(Figure 3B and Table 2). The difference was 8.5% (95% CI, 6.0% to 10.9%; P < .001). 
Testosterone treatment also significantly increased estimated strength of peripheral and 
whole bone (Figure 3B and Table 2). The magnitudes of the effects of testosterone treatment 
on estimated hip strength were less than those on the spine, but still significant (Figure 3B 
and Table 2).
By DXA, testosterone treatment increased mean aBMD (3.3%; 95% CI, 2.01% to 4.56%) 
more than placebo (2.1%; 95% CI, 0.87% to 3.36%; P = .01, r2 = 0.12) (Table 2). In the total 
hip, testosterone treatment was associated with a mean increase of 1.2% (95% CI, 0.19% to 
2.17%) compared with 0.5% (95% CI, −0.45% to 1.46%) for placebo (P = .052, r2 = 0.13). 
In the femoral neck, testosterone treatment was associated with a mean increase of 1.5% 
(95% CI, 0.02% to 2.97%) and placebo of 0.9% (95% CI, −0.49% to 2.35%; P = .27, r2 = 
0.06).

 Adjusting the analyses for the variables in which the 2 arms differed at baseline (body mass 
index, alcohol use, and estradiol level) did not change appreciably any of the QCT or DXA 
results.
During the treatment year, 6 fractures were reported and confirmed in each treatment arm 
(eTable 1 in Supplement 2). During the subsequent year of observation, 3 fractures were 
reported and confirmed in the testosterone arm and 4 in the placebo arm.
Adverse Events
In the entire TTrial population of 790, testosterone treatment was not associated with a 
greater incidence of prostate or cardiovascular adverse events than placebo treatment.24
Discussion
Testosterone treatment for 1 year of older men with low testosterone concentrations 
improved all aspects of sexual function and improved somewhat mood and depressive 
symptoms.24 The results reported here show that testosterone treatment of these men also 
significantly increased the vBMD and estimated bone strength, more so in the spine than the 
hip and more so in trabecular bone than cortical-rich peripheral bone.
These results are unequivocal compared with prior studies of the effect of testosterone 
treatment on bone in older men,19-22 in spite of treatment limited to 1 year, perhaps because 
the mean pretreatment testosterone level was lower and the sample size larger than in prior 
studies and because the primary outcome in this trial was vBMD by QCT. This technique 
avoids the artifactual increases in DXA-derived aBMD caused by osteophytes and aortic 
calcification,4,28 and allows assessment of trabecular bone, which testosterone treatment 
improves preferentially.18
These results are not surprising, however, in view of the effects on bone in men who are 
severely hypogonadal as a consequence of pituitary or testicular disease, who consistently 
show improvement in vBMD14 in response totestosterone treatment. The effect of 
testosterone on strength of trabecular bone in the spine, as estimated by FEA of QCT data in 
the men in the Bone Trial, is consistent with that of testosterone on trabecular bone in the 
distal tibia (a site also high in trabecular bone) of severely hypogonadal men, determined by 
FEA of magnetic resonance microimaging data.18
The effects of testosterone treatment on vBMD and estimated bone strength in these men 
seem to compare favorably with the effects of antiresorptive or anabolic agents meant for 
osteoporosis,32-35 although direct comparisons cannot be made because those studies were 
performed in postmenopausal (severely hypogonadal) women with osteoporosis, whereas 
men in this trial were generally moderately hypogonadal and not osteoporotic.
The mechanism by which testosterone treatment exerts these effects on bone cannot be 
discerned by this study design. Considerable evidence shows that much of the effect of 
testosterone on bone is mediated by conversion to estradiol.36-40 In these men, testosterone 
treatment was associated with a pronounced increase in both testosterone and estradiol

 concentrations. In the testosterone-treated men, the increases in vBMD of spine trabecular 
bone were significantly associated with the increases in testosterone and estradiol level.
The clinical significance of the effect of testosterone treatment on vBMD and estimated 
bone strength in these men will depend on whether testosterone treatment also reduces 
fracture risk. Some evidence suggests that it might. Bone strength, as estimated by FEA of 
QCT data, does correlate well with physical strength of human vertebrae29 and is associated 
with prevalent bone fractures41 and incident spine42 and hip30 fractures. Only a larger and 
longer trial, however, will determine whether testosterone treatment does reduce fracture risk 
in older men with low testosterone levels.
Limitations
The strengths of this trial include the unequivocally low testosterone concentrations of the 
participants, double-blind design, increase in serum testosterone to mid-normal for young 
men, and excellent participant retention. An important limitation of this trial is that because 
the participants were men with low serum testosterone levels, the results apply only to this 
population. In addition, because most men in this trial did not have osteoporosis by baseline 
T-scores, these results cannot be extrapolated to men who have osteoporosis but not low 
testosterone. An analytic limitation is the inflated probability of a false-positive finding due 
to multiple testing; however, the large number of significant findings is not likely due to 
chance alone, suggesting that testosterone treatment truly improves bone outcomes.
Conclusions
We conclude that testosterone treatment of older men with low testosterone levels 
significantly increased their vBMD and estimated bone strength, more so in the spine than 
hip and more so in trabecular bone than cortical-rich peripheral bone. These results should 
give impetus to a larger and longer trial to determine whether testosterone treatment of older 
men with low testosterone reduces fracture risk.

 Key Points
Question Will testosterone treatment of older men with low testosterone improve their 
bone density and strength?
Findings Testosterone treatment of older men with low testosterone increased volumetric 
trabecular bone mineral density of the lumbar spine and estimated bone strength 
significantly compared with placebo.
Meaning These results suggest that a larger and longer trial to determine whether 
testosterone treatment decreases fracture risk in this population is warranted.
