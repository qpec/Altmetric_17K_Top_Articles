Abstract
Oncolytic viruses selectively lyse tumor cells, disrupt immu-
nosuppression within the tumor, and reactivate antitumor immu-
nity, but they have yet to live up to their therapeutic potential.
Immune checkpoint modulation has been efficacious in a variety
of cancer with an immunogenic microenvironment, but is asso-
ciated with toxicity due to nonspecific T-cell activation. Therefore,
combining these two strategies would likely result in both effec-
tive and specific cancer therapy. To test the hypothesis, we first
constructed oncolytic adenovirus Delta-24-RGDOX expressing
the immune costimulator OX40 ligand (OX40L). Like its prede-
cessor Delta-24-RGD, Delta-24-RGDOX induced immunogenic
cell death and recruit lymphocytes to the tumor site. Compared
with Delta-24-RGD, Delta-24-RGDOX exhibited superior tumor-
specific activation of lymphocytes and proliferation of CD8þ T
cells specific to tumor-associated antigens, resulting in cancer-
specific immunity. Delta-24-RGDOX mediated more potent anti-
glioma activity in immunocompetent C57BL/6 but not immu-
nodeficient athymic mice, leading to specific immune memory
against the tumor. To further overcome the immune suppression
mediated by programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression on
cancer cells accompanied with virotherapy, intratumoral injection
of Delta-24-RGDOX and an anti-PD-L1 antibody showed syner-
gistic inhibition of gliomas and significantly increased survival in
mice. Our data demonstrate that combining an oncolytic virus
with tumor-targeting immune checkpoint modulators elicits
potent in situ autologous cancer vaccination, resulting in an
efficacious, tumor-specific, and long-lasting therapeutic effect.

Introduction
Oncolytic viruses are a promising alternative therapy for
refractory cancers, including glioblastoma whose prognosis,
with a 5-year survival rate of 5%, has barely improved even
after decades of preclinical and clinical research (1). Although
virus-mediated oncolysis should, in theory, spread to all cancer
cells within the tumor (2, 3), this has yet to play out in clinical
trials. Thus far, clinical experience has shown that the antiviral
immune response and limited antitumor immunity developed
during virotherapy constrain the efficiency of the viruses when
they are used alone (2).
The second-generation oncolytic adenovirus Delta-24-RGD,
which targets aberrant RB pathway and av integrins expression
in cancer cells (4), caused potent oncolysis in human cancer
xenografts in immunodeficient mice (4–7) and triggered anti-
glioma immunity in a syngeneic immunocompetent mouse
glioma model (8, 9). Importantly, the first phase I clinical trial
of Delta-24-RGD in patients with recurrent glioblastoma
revealed that an intratumoral viral injection solicited an
inflammatory response and a durable complete response in
about 12% of patients (10). We speculated that the subop-
timal efficacy of Delta-24-RGD could be improved by devel-
oping strategies to enhance virus-mediated antitumor immu-
nity because the paradigm in oncolytic virotherapy has shifted
from oncolysis to immunomediated eradication of the tumor
(2, 11).
In the past two decades, immune checkpoint modulation has
shown promise in treating a variety of malignancies (12). How-
ever, this type of therapy is less effective in cancers with an
immunosuppressive microenvironment (13). Interestingly, dur-
ing virotherapy, viral infection, replication, and subsequent
tumor necrosis cooperate to disrupt the immunosuppressive
tumor microenvironment, resulting in T-cell reactivity against
cancer neoantigens (2, 14, 15). Thus, combining checkpoint
blockade with oncolytic virotherapy is an attractive candidate
anticancer strategy. Accordingly, preclinical and clinical studies
are presently underway to investigate the potential of combining
checkpoint blockade with oncolytic viral therapies (15, 16). A

 phase II, multicenter clinical trial for the combination of Delta-24-
RGD and an antibody against programmed cell death 1 (PD-1),
an immune checkpoint coinhibitor, has just begun in patients
with recurrent glioblastomas or gliosarcomas (ClinicalTrials.gov
Identifier: NCT02798406).
We hypothesized that the efficacy of Delta-24-RGD would be
improved by modifying it to express an immune costimulator,
such as OX40 ligand (OX40L), to enhance the antigen-present-
ing function of the tumor cells and stimulate tumor-specific T-
cell activation. Unlike ligands CD80 and CD86 that bind both
immune costimulator CD28 and coinhibitor CTLA-4 (12),
OX40L binds a unique costimulator OX40 on T cells (17),
which makes it a better choice to arm the virus to enhance
activation of T cells recognizing tumor antigens on tumor cells
infected by the virus. Thus, due to cancer selectivity of the virus,
this strategy is more tumor-specific than immune checkpoint
blockade. The latter can result in a diffuse T-cell repertoire
expansion that reduces self-tolerance and damages healthy
organs, causing immune-related adverse events (18). Moreover,
the receptors of this type of costimulators are upregulated on
many immune cells upon activation (19, 20) and their agonist
antibodies have shown therapeutic benefit in both preclinical
cancer models and cancer patients (20–23), especially when
combined with strategies to shift the cytokine balance towards
a Th1 milieu (20), which is a typical consequence of adeno-
viral therapy (8, 9). In addition, programmed death-ligand 1
(PD-L1), a ligand for PD-1, is commonly expressed on tumor
cells (12), and what makes it even more relevant to oncolytic
adenoviral treatment is that, as a negative feedback to inflam-
matory response, PD-L1 is upregulated by IFNg (24), which is
induced by adenoviral infection (8, 9). Because blocking PD-
L1 with its antibody mainly targets tumor cells and antigen-
presenting cells, this strategy should have less toxicity than
targeting T cells with CTLA-4 or PD-1 antibodies. We specu-
lated that intratumoral injection of PD-L1 antibody, which
confines its effect more localized within the tumor, in addi-
tion to oncolytic adenoviruses should block the inhibitory
signal from the tumor cells and further potentiate the effect of
the viruses.
Thus far, although oncolytic viruses have been combined with
immune modulators to increase efficacy (2, 15, 16), the specificity
and safety of this type of combination have not been well
addressed. We hypothesized that we could improve them through
taking advantage of the cancer selectivity of oncolytic viruses and
immune modulations mainly targeted to cancer cells. Therefore,
in this study, we first constructed oncolytic adenovirus Delta-24-
RGDOX whose genome includes a mouse OX40L expression
cassette. The new virus efficiently expressed the ligand on the cell
surface of a panel of human and mouse cancer cell lines without
significant change in its replication capacity. Like Delta-24-RGD,
Delta-24-RGDOX induced autophagy and immunogenic cell
death that could trigger innate immune response. Compared
with Delta-24-RGD, Delta-24-RGDOX was more efficient to
increase both CD4þ and CD8þ T cells in the tumor site and
induce lymphocyte activity against tumor cells in a mouse glioma
model. Further studies revealed that Delta-24-RGDOX infection
directly enhanced the ability of tumor cells to activate lympho-
cytes, including CD8þ T cells specific for tumor-associated anti-
gens (TAA), through expressing OX40L on the cell surface, result-
ing in tumor-specific immunity. Consequently, Delta-24-RGDOX
was more potent to induce antiglioma activity than Delta-24-RGD
in immunocompetent but not in athymic mice, causing specific
immune memory against the tumor, which had been treated with
the virus. Furthermore, we found IFNg upregulated PD-L1 expres-
sion in a panel of human glioma stem cell (GSC) lines and mouse
glioma cell lines. Consistently, Delta-24-RGDOX infection also
upregulated PD-L1 expression on the tumor cells from the mouse
glioma model. Thus, we combined Delta-24-RGDOX with intra-
tumoral injection of a PD-L1 antibody and found they synergized
to reject gliomas. In summary, our findings demonstrate that
oncolytic adenovirus combined with tumor-targeting immune
modulations induces potent ongoing in situ cancer vaccination
during therapy, resulting in efficacious, specific, and long-lasting
anticancer effect.
Materials and Methods
Cell lines and culture conditions
Human glioblastoma-astrocytoma U-87 MG (2005–2010) and
lung carcinoma A549 cells (2005–2010, ATCC), mouse glioma
GL261 cells (NCI-Frederick Cancer Research Tumor Repository,
2011), GL261-5 cells (an isolated GL261 cell clone that resulted in
a longer life span of the mice than did the parental GL261 cells
when implanted intracranially); GL261-enhanced GFP (EGFP)
cells (a kind gift from Dr. Kaminska, Nencki Institute of Exper-
imental Biology, Warsaw, Poland, 2011), and GL261-ovalbumin
(OVA) cells (8) were cultured in DMEM/F12 supplemented with
10% FBS (HyClone Laboratories, Inc.), 100 mg/mL penicillin, and
100 mg/mL streptomycin, except in the GL261-OVA culture, to
which 1 mg/mL puromycin (Life Technologies) was also added as
described (8). Mouse melanoma cell line B16-F10 (ATCC, 2012)
was maintained in RPMI1640 medium supplemented with 10%
FBS and antibiotics. Human embryonic kidney 293 (Qbiogene,
Inc., 1990s), mouse glioma CT-2A (generously donated by Dr.
Thomas Seyfried, Boston College, Boston, MA, 2016) and mouse
lung carcinoma CMT64 (Culture Collections, Public Health Eng-
land, United Kingdom, 2014) cells were maintained in DMEM
supplemented with 10% FBS and antibiotics. Mouse primary
astrocytes (AllCells, LLC, 2015) were grown in AGM Astrocyte
Growth Medium (Lonza). Human GSCs had been established
from acute cell dissociation of human glioblastoma surgical
specimens (2005–2015). The study was approved by the Insti-
tutional Review Board at The University of Texas MD Anderson
Cancer Center and in accordance with Belmont Report. Written
informed consent was required for every patient. The GSCs
were maintained in DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with
B27 (Invitrogen), EGF, and basic fibroblast growth factor (20
ng/mL each, Sigma-Aldrich) according to the procedures
described elsewhere (6). All cells were kept at 37�C in a
humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. All GSC lines were
verified through short tandem repeat (STR) fingerprinting (in
2012). Experiments were carried out within 6 months after the
cell lines were obtained from a cell bank (B16-F10 and CMT64)
or after the verification (GSCs). U-87 MG cells were reauthen-
ticated with STR in 2016. GL261 cells were re-verified through
karyotyping in 2016. All cell lines were tested as mycoplasma-
free.
Mice
C57BL/6 and athymic mice were provided by the MD Ander-
son Cancer Center Mouse Resource Facility. OT-I mice (C57BL/
6-Tg[TcraTcrb]1100Mjb/J) were purchased from The Jackson
Laboratory.

 Animal studies
For tumor implantation, GL261 cells and its derivatives (5 �
104 cells/mouse) were grafted into the caudate nucleus of the 7- to
10-week-old mice using a guide-screw system as described pre-
viously (5). The mice with implanted tumors were randomly
assigned to experimental groups. Then the viruses [5 � 107
plaque-forming units (PFU)/mouse], the OX40 agonist antibody
OX86 (25 mg/mouse; provided by the Monoclonal Antibody Core
Facility at MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX), the anti-
mouse PD-L1 antibody, and/or rat IgG (25 mg/mouse; Bio X Cell)
were injected intratumorally. For rechallenging the surviving
mice, GL261-5 (5 � 104 cells /mouse) or B16-F10 (1 � 103
cells/mouse) cells were implanted in the same hemisphere pre-
viously implanted with the cured tumor or in the contralateral
hemisphere of the mouse brain. All animal studies (except one
survival study in athymic mice) were conducted in C57BL/6 mice.
All experimental procedures involving the use of mice were done
in accordance with protocols approved by the Animal Care and
Use Committee of MD Anderson Cancer Center and followed
NIH and United States Department of Agriculture guidelines.
Flow cytometry analysis
To monitor the disruption of the cell membrane (cell death)
induced by the viruses, cells (2–5 � 105) were stained with 8
mmol/L ethidium homodimer 1 (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS solution
for 15 minutes at room temperature. To analyze cell surface
protein expression, cells (2–5 � 105) were first incubated in
100 mL primary antibody solution diluted in PBS plus 3% BSA
and 1 mmol/L ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid. After incubation
at 4�C in the dark for 30 minutes, the cells were washed once with
1-mL cold PBS. If a secondary antibody was to be applied, the
incubation procedure was repeated with the secondary antibody.
After being washed once with PBS, the cells were finally resus-
pended in 0.5-mL PBS. The stained cells were then analyzed using
flow cytometry. The antibodies used in the studies were as follows:
anti-mouse CD252 (OX40L) adenomatous polyposis coli (APC,
17-5905-80), anti-mouse CD45 APC-eFluor 780 (47-0451-82),
anti-mouse CD3 fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC, 11-0031-81),
anti-mouse CD4 eFluor 450 (48-0041-80), anti-mouse CD8a
PerCP-Cyanine 5.5 (45-0081-82), anti-human PD-L1 APC (17-
5983-41) and anti-mouse CD8a APC (17-0081-81), anti-mouse
CD279 (PD-1) PE-Cyanine7 (25-9985-80), anti-mouse CD152
(CTLA-4) APC (17-1522-80) were obtained from eBioscience;
goat anti-rat IgG -FITC (ab6115) was from Abcam; and anti-
mouse CD252 (OX40L) purified (108802) and anti-mouse PD-
L1 APC (124311) were obtained from BioLegend.
ATP and HMGB1 release analyses
The medium was collected from the cell cultures. The amount
of ATP in the medium was determined with an ENLITEN ATP
Assay System (Promega). The HMGB1 in the medium was quan-
titated with an HMGB1 ELISA Kit (IBL International).
Preparation of splenocytes and CD8þ T lymphocytes
Mouse spleens were collected, placed in a 100-mm cell strainer
set in petri dishes with RPMI1640 medium, and then smashed
through the cell strainer into the dish. The mixture in the dish was
gently pipetted up and down and brought up to 5 mL/spleen. The
cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 350 � g for 7 minutes at
room temperature and then resuspended in Red Blood Cell Lysing
Buffer Hybri-Max (Sigma-Aldrich) to lyse the red blood cells,
according to the manufacturer's instructions. Finally, CD8þ T cells
were enriched with a Mouse CD8aþ T Cell Isolation Kit (Miltenyi
Biotec, Inc.).
Preparation of brain-infiltrating lymphocytes
Brain-infiltrating leukocytes (BIL; from a group of five to nine
mouse brain hemispheres) were separated from myelin debris
using Percoll (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences) and gradient centri-
fuged as described previously (25). BILs were then enriched using
a gradient centrifuge with Lympholyte-M Cell Separation Media
(Cedarlane) as instructed by the manufacturer.
Preparation of bone marrow–derived mouse dendritic cells
Mouse dendritic cells (mDC) were isolated from mouse bone
marrow of femurs and tibias as described (26). After 7 days
in culture, mDCs were collected and 1 mg/mL lipopolysacchar-
ides (Sigma-Aldrich) was added for the final 18 hours of culture
to induce maturation. The matured mDCs were primed with
10 mg/mL OVA (257–264) peptide for one hour at 37�C.
Stimulation of immune cells
To prepare the target cells, GL261 or GL261-OVA cells were
infected with virus at 100 PFU per cell. Four hours later, 100 U/mL
of mouse IFNg (Prospec Protein Specialists) was added to the
culture. Forty-eight hours after viral infection, the cells were
fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde. To activate immune cells,
pre-fixed target cells (2 � 104/well) were incubated with spleno-
cytes (5 � 105/well) or BILs (5 � 104/well). To measure the OVA-
specific T-cell reaction, CD8þ T cells (3 � 105/well) were stimu-
lated with pre-fixed mouse dendritic cells (1 � 105/well) primed
with the OVA 257–264 peptide (InvivoGen). Forty hours after the
coculture in a round-bottom 96-well plate, the concentration of
IFNg in the supernatant was assessed with an ELISA (Mouse IFNg
DuoSet; R&D Systems).
In vitro lymphocyte cell proliferation
OVA-specific CD8þ T cells were isolated from the spleens of
OT-I mice (C57BL/6-Tg[TcraTcrb]1100Mjb/J; The Jackson Lab-
oratory) and labeled with 5 mmol/L carboxyfluorescein diace-
tate succinimidyl ester (CFSE; Life Technologies) for 5 minutes
(27). The labeled T cells (1 � 105/well) were stimulated with
target cells (5 � 104/well) in a round-bottom 96-well plate.
Four days later, the cells were stained with anti-mouse CD8a
allophycocyanin (APC) and analyzed with flow cytometry for
green fluorescence (CFSE amount) in CD8þ cells. Proliferating
cells were defined as those exhibiting lower CFSE amount than
unstimulated cells.
Statistical analysis
In quantitative studies of cultured cells, each group consisted of
triplicate samples. Each study was repeated at least once. The
differences between groups were evaluated using a two-tailed
Student t-test. The animal survival curves were plotted according
to the Kaplan–Meier method. Survival rates in the different
treatment groups were compared using the log-rank test. The
synergistic interactions of the agents in survival studies were
analyzed based on the normal survival model using the function
survreg in R, and a residual plot was used to examine the
parametric assumption of the model (28). P values < 0.05 were
considered significant.

 Results
Oncolytic adenovirus Delta-24-RGDOX expresses OX40L and
preserves replication capacity
We first generated Delta-24-RGDOX, a replication-compe-
tent adenovirus that included an expression cassette for mouse
OX40L (mOX40L) on Delta-24-RGD backbone (Fig. 1A;
refs. 5, 7). The new virus efficiently expressed mOX40L on the
cell membranes of living cultured mouse and human cancer
cells (P < 0.0001, Fig. 1B; Supplementary Fig. S1). In in vivo
settings, we analyzed mOX40L expression in cells from gliomas
arising from intracranial injection of GL261 cells stably expres-
sing enhanced GFP (GL261-EGFP, Fig. 1C), which revealed
that approximately 10% of the tumor cells were mOX40Lþ 3
days after Delta-24-RGDOX intratumoral injection (P ¼
0.02, Fig. 1C). The modification in the viral genome did not
significantly change its replication capability in human U-87
MG glioma cells (P ¼ 0.05) and mouse GL261 glioma cells (P ¼
0.44; Fig. 1D).
Delta-24-RGDOX induces autophagy and immunogenic
cell death
Adenoviruses potently induce autophagic cell death (29).
Accordingly, we found this capability in Delta-24-RGDOX,
which induced autophagy and cell lysis more robustly than
Delta-24-RGD, as shown by the increased LCII/I ratio (Fig. 2A)
and rupture in cell membrane (Fig. 2B). It was reported that
this type of cell death attracted immune cells via the extracel-
lular release of damage- (or danger-)associated molecular
pattern (DAMP) molecules, such as ATP and the high-mobility
group protein B1 (HMGB1; refs. 30, 31). Thus, we found that
both Delta-24-RGD and Delta-24-RGDOX induced the release
of ATP and HMGB1 from infected cells (P < 0.0001, Fig. 2C
and D) and that Delta-24-RGDOX mediated HMGB1 release
more efficiently than Delta-24-RGD (P ¼ 0.001, Fig. 2D), most
likely because of its enhanced ability to induce autophagy and
lysis in infected cells (P < 0.0002, Fig. 2A and B).
Delta-24-RGDOX increases lymphocyte infiltration at the
tumor site and enhances antiglioma immunity
through OX40L expression
During viral therapy, the DAMPs induced by intratumoral viral
injections attract immune cells to the tumor site and elicit an
innate immune response that results in the development of
adaptive antitumor immunity (30). To test this, we used a
syngeneic GL261-C57BL/6 immunocompetent glioma model
with tumor-infiltrating OX40þ T cells (21). We treated mice with
three intratumoral viral injections to partially compensate for
Figure 2.
Immunogenic cell death induced by
Delta-24-RGDOX. A, GL261 cells were
infected with indicated viruses at
100 PFU/cell. Seventy-two hours later,
the cell lysates were analyzed with
immunoblotting for the cytosolic
form of microtubule-associated protein
1A/1B-light chain 3 (LC3 I), or its
phosphatidylethanolamine conjugate
(LC3 II). The LC3 II/I ratio is used to
monitor autophagy. The E1A levels were
used as an indicator of the relative viral
dose and normalized to the value in the
D24-RGD group, which was set to 1.
a-Tubulin levels are shown as a protein
loading control. AdGFP was used as a
replication-deficient viral vector control.
B, GL261 cells were infected with the
indicated viruses at 100 PFU/cell. Cells
were harvested after 72 hours and cell
lysis (cell death) was monitored with
ethidium homodimer-1 staining and
analyzed with flow cytometry.
C and D, To assess immunogenic cell
death induced by the viruses, GL261
cells were infected with the indicated
viruses at 100 PFU/cell. After 72 hours,
the culture medium was collected
and assayed for the amount of
ATP (C) or HMGB1 (D). The relative ATP
levels (C, 1 ¼ average amount of ATP in
mock-treated cells) and HMGB1
concentrations are shown (D). Values

 deficient viral replication in GL261 cells (Fig. 3A; ref. 8). In mice
injected with either Delta-24-RGD or Delta-24-RGDOX, more T
lymphocytes (CD45þ/CD3þ), Th cells (CD45þ/CD3þ/CD4þ),
and cytotoxic T cells (CD45þ/CD3þ/CD8þ) were present at the
tumor site than in mice injected with PBS (P < 0.05). Moreover,
significantly more of these cells were present in Delta-24-
RGDOX–injected mice than in Delta-24-RGD–injected mice
(P < 0.001, Fig. 3B). Next, we examined the antitumor activity
of the immune cells through assessing the IFNg secretion by these
cells when they were stimulated with tumor cells. Thus, the BILs
from the hemispheres with Delta-24-RGDOX–injected tumor
showed significantly higher activity against the tumor cells with
or without viral infection than the BILs from the Delta-24-RGD-
treated or PBS-treated groups(P � 0.0001, Fig. 3C,left), indicating
that Delta-24-RGDOX mediated a stronger antitumor immune
response at the tumor site than did Delta-24-RGD. The same effect
was observed in splenocytes from the treatment groups (P <
0.05, Fig. 3C, right), although the increment of the activation
induced by Delta-24-RGDOX is not as great as in BILs. Consistent
with the costimulating activity of OX40L, Delta-24-RGDOX–
infected tumor cells triggered higher activation of the BILs than
Delta-24-RGD–infected cells (P < 0.001, Fig. 3C, left), and this
effect was blocked by the presence of the anti-OX40L antibody (P
¼ 0.004, Fig. 3D).
Delta-24-RGDOX stimulates a tumor-specific
immune response
To further demonstrate the capability of Delta-24-RGDOX
to stimulate immunity against TAAs, we used OVA protein as
a model antigen (32). Using CFSE staining to track T-cell
proliferation, we found that GL261-OVA cells (8) infected with
Delta-24-RGDOX induced proliferation of OVA-specific CD8þ
T cells more robustly than GL261-OVA cells infected with
Delta-24-RGD (P ¼ 0.0002, Fig. 4A). Accordingly, CD8þ T
cells isolated from mice-harboring GL261-OVA gliomas that
had been treated with Delta-24-RGDOX displayed significantly
higher activity against mouse dendritic cells primed with an
OVA (257–264) peptide (32) than cells from mice treated with
Delta-24-RGD (P ¼ 0.001, Fig. 4B, left). This virus-elicited
immunity against OVA correlated with the tumor cell-stimu-
lated activation of splenocytes from virus-treated glioma-bear-
ing mice, which was not observed when the splenocytes were
cocultured with primary mouse astrocytes (P ¼ 0.0002, Fig. 4B,
right), indicating that Delta-24-RGDOX-elicited immunity is
tumor specific.
Delta-24-RGDOX effectively induces antiglioma activity in
syngeneic immunocompetent mouse glioma models
Next, we performed survival studies using the GL261-C57BL/
6 mouse glioma model to evaluate the antiglioma activity of
Delta-24-RGDOX (Fig. 5A). The results revealed that GL261
tumors treated with three doses of Delta-24-RGD alone did not
affect survival compared with PBS (median survivals: 17 days
vs. 16 days, P ¼ 0.08, Fig. 5B, left). However, the addition of
the OX40 agonist antibody OX86 significantly prolonged sur-
vival (median survivals: 24 vs. 17 days, P ¼ 0.0002, Fig. 5B,
left). The treatment of tumors with Delta-24-RGDOX further
extended the median survival (median survival: 28.5 days vs.
17 days, P < 0.0001), producing a 20% long-term survival rate
(Fig. 5B, left).
To determine the effect of anticancer immunity on survival
rates, we repeated the treatments in immunodeficient athymic
mice. Neither Delta-24-RGDOX nor the combination of Delta-24-
RGD with OX86 showed a therapeutic benefit when compared
with PBS (median survival: 16 days vs. 16 days, P > 0.05, Fig. 5B,
right). The dramatic difference in the therapeutic effect of Delta-
24-RGDOX between immunocompetent and immunodeficient
mice underscores the essential role played by virotherapy-induced
immunity.
Consistent with these results, histopathologic studies of the
mouse brains revealed that Delta-24-RGDOX induced tumor
necrosis in C57BL/6 mice, which was not observed in either
C57BL/6 mice treated with Delta-24-RGD or athymic mice
treated with Delta-24-RGDOX (Fig. 5C), indicating the necrosis
was induced by antitumor immunity but not by oncolysis.
Moreover, the morphology and histology of the brains of the
Delta-24-RGDOX–treated mice showed no signs of acute or
chronic inflammation in the normal brain tissue (Fig. 5C;
Supplementary Fig. S2). These data are consistent with our
observations of the tumor-specific immunity induced by Delta-
24-RGDOX (Fig. 4B, right).
Because Delta-24-RGDOX only induced 20% long-term sur-
vival in the GL261-C57BL/6 model, we speculated that its ther-
apeuticefficacyhadbeencompromisedbytherapidgrowthofthe
tumor. Accordingly, Delta-24-RGDOX demonstrated much
greater therapeutic efficacy in the slow-growing GL261-5 glioma
model than Delta-24-RGD (median survival: undefined vs. 50–
52 days, P � 0.0003), resulting in a 70% long-term survival rate
(Fig. 5D).
Rechallenging the survivors of Delta-24-RGDOX–treated mice
with GL261-5 cells failed to produce gliomas in 4 of 6 animals,
whereas all na€
�ve mice showed signs of intracranial disease and
died of gliomas (median survivals: undefined vs. 47 days, P ¼
0.0006, Fig. 5E, left). However, rechallenging mice with B16-F10
melanoma cells caused brain tumors in both the survivor and
na€
�ve mice (median survivals: 13.5 days vs. 13.5 days, P ¼ 0.6, Fig.
5E, right). These results suggest that Delta-24-RGDOX effectively
induces specific immune memory against the same type of tumor
that has been treated with the virus, which is potentiated by the
virus-mediated OX40L expression (33).
Delta-24-RGDOX and anti-PD-L1 antibody
synergize to inhibit gliomas
The immune checkpoint inhibitor PD-1 ligand PD-L1 is com-
monly overexpressed in many different tumor types, including
gliomas, where it inhibits tumor-directed T-cell activity (12).
Moreover, adenovirus-induced IFNg may further upregulate the
expression of PD-L1 during virotherapy (8, 12). To explore this,
we examined 8 human GSC lines and found that in all cases,
relatively low levels of PD-L1 were significantly upregulated by
IFNg (Fig. 6A, P < 0.002). Similarly, GL261-5 cells expressed a low
level of PD-L1 [median fluorescence intensity (MFI) ¼ 37.4],
which was slightly enhanced by infection with Delta-24-RGDOX
(MFI ¼ 59.7; Fig. 6B). However, IFNg dramatically increased PD-
L1 expression in GL261-5 cells both with (MFI ¼ 529) and
without (MFI ¼ 661) Delta-24-RGDOX infection (Fig. 6B). Basal
PD-L1 expression levels were slightly high in GL261-EGFP
cells and also increased in response to IFNg treatment (Supple-
mentary Fig. S3). Moreover, Delta-24-RGDOX injection in the
gliomas derived from GL261-EGFP cells further upregulated PD-
L1 levels in the tumor cells that was already higher than in the

 cultured cells (MFI increased from 750 to 1176; Fig. 6C). Fur-
thermore, after Delta-24-RGDOX treatment, the expression of
PD-1 on tumor-infiltrating CD8þ T cells increased by 58% (P ¼
0.0007), whereas the expression of another immune checkpoint
inhibitor, CTLA-4, remained unchanged (P ¼ 0.4; Fig. 6D). These
results suggest that the virotherapy results in a feedback activation
of PD-L1/PD-1 pathway to compromise the antitumor immunity
induced by the virus.
To further potentiate efficacy, we combined Delta-24-RGDOX
with an anti-PD-L1 antibody to treat the gliomas derived from
GL261-5 cells in C57BL/6 mice. We intratumorally injected the
antibody to confine its effect mainly in the tumor, 2 days after the
first viral dose and 3 days after the second to diminish the
potential adverse effects of the antibody on the virus (Fig. 7A).
The combination resulted in a long-term survival rate of 85%,
whereas 2 injections of the virus alone extended the median
survival time by 19 days, which corresponded to a long-term
survival rate of only 28% (median survival: undefined vs. 57 days,
P ¼ 0.0001); the antibody alone extended the median survival
time by 11 days, which corresponded to a long-term survival rate
of only 15% (median survival: undefined vs. 49 days, P < 0.0001).
The results demonstrated that these two agents synergized to reject
the tumor (Fig. 7B, P ¼ 0.036).
In the long-term surviving mice treated with the combina-
tion, tumor remnant was found in the brains at the tumor
implantation site (Fig. 7C), suggesting that the treatment
induced complete regression. Moreover, five of the six surviving
mice in the combination treatment group also survived a
rechallenge with the same tumor cells in the contralateral
hemisphere, whereas all na€
�ve mice died of gliomas (median
survival: undefined vs. 35 days, P ¼ 0.0001, Fig. 7D). These
findings suggest that the combination treatment induced the
development of an immune memory that prevented tumor
growth at a distant site.

 combining it with an intratumoral injection of an anti-PD-L1
antibody. For the first time, we demonstrate that this strategy is
both efficacious and specific for cancer therapy.
Oncolytic viruses have emerged as promising immunothera-
peutics for cancer treatment (2). Viral infection of the tumor cells
within the tumor mass not only disrupts the immunosuppression
to cause local inflammation and activate the innate response but
also lead to adaptive antitumor immunity (8, 15). To improve the
relative dismal efficacy of oncolytic viruses as a single agent in
cancer patients, the viruses have been modified to express cyto-
kines or combined with immune checkpoint blockade to upre-
gulate the activity of immune cells (15, 34–37). To this end, in
2015, Amgen's T-Vec (talimogene laherparepvec), a modified
herpes simplex virus type 1 with cancer-selective replication and
GM-CSF expression, has shown efficacy in melanoma patients
and became the first oncolytic virus to gain approval by the FDA to
treat surgically unresectable skin and lymph node lesions in
patients with advanced melanoma (38, 39). However, because
the cytokines expressed by the viruses can be released to the
vicinity of the cells and transported to the whole body through
blood and lymphatic circulation, the effect is not cancer cell-
specific and poses the risk to globally activate the immune cells,
resulting in toxicity. On the contrary, Delta-24-RGDOX expresses
an immune costimulator on cancer cells, which enhances the
capability of the cells to activate T cells recognizing TAAs pre-
sented on the cell surface. Therefore, the effect induced by Delta-
24-RGDOX is more localized, resulting in specific immunity to
cancer cells.
To pursue cancer-specific therapy, efforts have been made to
develop therapeutic cancer vaccines. So far, the therapeutic
vaccination can only be clinically successful as monotherapy
in premalignant or minimal residual disease but not in estab-
lished cancers (40). Although vaccine strategies have been
successful in increasing the frequency and activity of tumor-
specific T cells, they have failed to ensure that these T cells could
home to tumors and/or exert their function within the tumor
because of the immunosuppressive environment within the
tumor (40). Unlike just presenting antigens through profes-
sional antigen-presenting cells in cancer vaccine therapy, the
effect of Delta-24-RGDOX is multiplex. The infection of the
cancer cells by the virus releases PAMPs and DAMPs to induce
innate immune response within the tumor, changing the tumor
microenvironment from immunosuppressive to immune active
(8, 9, 41). Before the TAAs from the debris of the cancer cells
lysed by the virus are presented through professional antigen-
presenting cells, the OX40L expression and IFNg-mediated
expression of MHCs on the tumor cells induced by the virus
enhance the role of cancer cells as ad hoc antigen-presenting

 cells (8). Moreover, because the vaccine strategy only covers a
part of the cancer antigen repertoire, after immune editing
during the therapy, cancer cells with different antigens can
escape and give rise to new tumor cell populations that are
resistant to the vaccine therapy (40, 42). However, Delat-24-
RGDOX is designed to infect the whole cancer cell population
and can mediate the presentation of the entire cancer antigens
to the immune system during the therapy (5–7). This makes the
virus promising to overcome the resistance of cancers due to
their heterogeneity and therapy-induced evolution of the tumor
cells, which are the main challenges in developing targeted
cancer therapies.
It has been reported that replication-deficient adenoviruses
expressing immunostimulator and cytotoxic genes showed
efficacy in a syngeneic rat multifocal glioma model (43–45),
suggesting an involvement of antitumor immunity induced by
the viruses. Furthermore, replication-competent adenoviruses
can induce autophagy and cell lysis, which result in immuno-
genic cell death (29), triggering an innate immune response
within the tumor that leads to adaptive anticancer immunity
(30). In addition, unlike a replication-deficient adenoviral
vector expressing OX40L (26), Delta-24-RGDOX can preferen-
tially replicate its viral genome in tumor cells (5, 7), suggesting
that OX40L expression is more specific to cancer cells. We have
demonstrated that Delta-24-RGDOX-infected tumor cells was
more efficient than Delta-24-RGD-infected cells to stimulate
the proliferation of CD8þ T cells recognizing TAA, suggesting
the virus is more potent to enhance in situ expansion of cancer-
specific T-cell populations within a tumor (46). Hence, within
the tumor microenvironment, Delta-24-RGDOX should be
more efficient to enlarge the pool of tumor-specific T cells
from the na€
�ve repertoire and reactivate existing tumor-specific
T cells that may be in a dormant or anergic state. This may be
partially responsible for the more remarkable increase of the
antitumor activity in BILs than in the splenocytes induced by
Delta-24-RGDOX treatment.
PD-L1 expression in glioma cells or tumor-associated macro-
phages mediates immunosuppression within gliomas (47, 48).
To increase the in situ activation of tumor-specific T cells,
instead of delivering it systemically in our experimental mouse
models, we intratumorally injected the anti-PD-L1 antibody to
block this immune checkpoint. The anti-PD-L1 antibody with-
in the tumor should further increase the antigen-presenting
function of the tumor cells, and enhance the presentation of
TAAs by dendritic cells and macrophages after they engulf and
process the debris of cancer cells lysed by the virus. Moreover,
viral infection increases the number of nature killer cells at the
tumor site (8, 49), which bind the Fc region of anti-PD-L1
antibody and can kill PD-L1-expressing tumor cells via anti-
body-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (50). Together, this com-
bination of Delta-24-RGDOX with anti-PD-L1 antibody syn-
ergistically increases antitumor efficacy and promotes the
development of a systemic immune memory that can attack
cancer cells in a distant location. This is particularly important
in glioblastoma where postsurgical resection and temozolo-
mide therapy, recurrence at distant sites is common, if not
inevitable (1).
Because human adenoviruses replicate less efficiently in
mouse cells, the ability of our study to recapitulate the actual
effect of an oncolytic adenoviral therapy in human patients is
limited. To partially compensate for this, we intratumorally
injected the virus multiple times over 2- or 3-day intervals to
mimic the viral infection-cell lysis-re-infection cycle. However,
the amount of virions does not exponentially escalate as in the
human host at the early stage of the viral infection. Thus, the
efficacy of the oncolytic adenoviruses may be compromised in
the mouse model because fewer virions are available for sub-
sequent re-infection and immunity against viral antigens pre-
sented on tumor cells is weaker. Therefore, we expect Delta-24-
RGDOX to be even more potent in human patients than in the
mouse models.
In summary, the oncolytic adenoviruses expressing immune
costimulator ligands demonstrate higher anticancer efficacy
than their predecessor Delta-24-RGD. Intratumoral injection
of Delta-24-RGDOX and an anti-PD-L1 antibody induced a
synergistic therapeutic effect in a mouse glioma model. The
effect is more targeted and specific to the tumor. This new
tumor-targeting combination strategy has exhibited exception-
al antitumor efficacy and immune memory, and may be trans-
lated to other solid tumors or metastatic tumors to offer safer
and effective alternative therapies for patients with refractory
cancers.
