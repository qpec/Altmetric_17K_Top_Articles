Abstract
Inhibitors of VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor)/VEGFR2 (vascular endothelial growth 
factor receptor 2) are commonly used in the clinic, but their beneficial effects are only observed in 
a subset of patients and limited by induction of diverse relapse mechanisms. We describe the up-
regulation of an adaptive immunosuppressive pathway during antiangiogenic therapy, by which 
PD-L1 (programmed cell death ligand 1), the ligand of the negative immune checkpoint regulator 
PD-1 (programmed cell death protein 1), is enhanced by interferon-γ–expressing T cells in 
distinct intratumoral cell types in refractory pancreatic, breast, and brain tumor mouse models. 
Successful treatment with a combination of anti-VEGFR2 and anti–PD-L1 antibodies induced 
high endothelial venules (HEVs) in PyMT (polyoma middle T oncoprotein) breast cancer and 
RT2-PNET (Rip1-Tag2 pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors), but not in glioblastoma (GBM). These 
HEVs promoted lymphocyte infiltration and activity through activation of lymphotoxin β receptor 
(LTβR) signaling. Further activation of LTβR signaling in tumor vessels using an agonistic 
antibody enhanced HEV formation, immunity, and subsequent apoptosis and necrosis in 
pancreatic and mammary tumors. Finally, LTβR agonists induced HEVs in recalcitrant GBM, 
enhanced cytotoxic T cell (CTL) activity, and thereby sensitized tumors to antiangiogenic/anti–
PD-L1 therapy. Together, our preclinical studies provide evidence that anti–PD-L1 therapy can

therapy can improve anti–PD-L1 treatment specifically when it generates intratumoral HEVs that 
facilitate enhanced CTL infiltration, activity, and tumor cell destruction.
INTRODUCTION
Sustained angiogenesis and immunosuppression are hallmarks of cancer (1). There is 
accumulating evidence that these two phenotypes are interconnected and facilitated by 
shared regulators not only during normal physiological processes, but also in cancer (2). 
Direct stimulation of the immune system with inhibitors of immune checkpoint regulators, 
such as antibodies against programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and its ligand, 
programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1), or cytotoxic T lymphocyte–associated antigen–4 
(CTLA-4), has been reported in multiple cancers, resulting in a plethora of ongoing clinical 
immunotherapeutic trials (3–5). This is based on the observation that cell constituents of 
tumors can express various surface molecules (such as PD-L1) that engage receptors (such 
as PD-1) on the surfaces of activated T cells, causing T cell anergy or exhaustion (6, 7). 
Despite these exciting benefits, only a few patients have responded to these 
immunotherapies, emphasizing the need to identify strategies that will increase response 
rates. A prerequisite for successful reversal of tumor-induced immunosuppression is to 
enable activation and infiltration of tumor antigen–specific T cells into malignant tissues to 
successfully eradicate tumor and metastatic cells.
Notably, the vasculature is an important regulator of immunity because it controls 
lymphocyte trafficking. Tumor angiogenic vasculature thwarts the extravasation of tumor-
reactive T cells and fosters an immunosuppressive microenvironment that allows tumors to 
evade host immunosurveillance (8). This is in part achieved by the increased amounts of 
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in most cancers, which promotes angiogenesis 
and impairs leukocyte-endothelial interactions by reducing ICAM-1 (intercellular adhesion 
molecule–1) and VCAM-1 (vascular cell adhesion molecule–1) adhesion molecules in 
angiogenic vessels to hinder immune T effector cell infiltration into the tumor (8, 9). VEGF 
also directly inhibits dendritic cell (DC) maturation and activates antigen-specific regulatory 
T cells in a neuropilin-1–dependent manner (10, 11). Thus, tumors modify the homeostatic 
tissue repair program to their advantage by converting immune cells (ICs) from an immune-
stimulating to an immunosuppressive and angiogenic phenotype and keeping blood vessels 
immunosuppressive (2).
The functional importance of VEGF in tumor angiogenesis and in immunosuppression has 
provided a convincing rationale for the development of inhibitors targeting the VEGF 
signaling pathway (12–14). Notwithstanding the favorable effects of these inhibitors in some 
patients, they improve progression-free survival and quality of life, but are unfortunately 
short-lived and modestly influence overall survival in most patients (12, 15, 16). Several 
escape mechanisms have been identified that help tumors adapt to the pressures of vascular 
growth restriction by either reinstating growth by neovascularization or by altering their 
growth behavior without revascularization (17–24). Studies in numerous preclinical models 
demonstrate that these adaptations can also be regulated by ICs, which provide an additional

 source of chemokines and cytokines to promote angiogenesis, immunosuppression, and 
other tumor hallmarks (17, 25–28). In this context, we had found that the efficacy of VEGF/
VEGF receptor (VEGFR) inhibitors hinged on their ability to induce an immunostimulatory 
milieu in tumors by repolarizing innate ICs to a T helper 1 (TH1) cell phenotype, which was 
inhibited when phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) was activated in myeloid cells, 
rendering tumors resistant to antiangiogenic therapy (17). Thus, it is conceivable that 
additional mechanisms exist to maintain or reinstate a tumor microenvironment that escapes 
immunosurveillance during treatment.
RESULTS
PD-L1 is up-regulated in tumors relapsing from antiangiogenic therapy
To identify immune-related underpinnings of resistance to antiangiogenic therapy, we used 
three syngeneic tumor models with differing responses to VEGF/VEGFR inhibitors. 
Antiangiogenic treatment (sorafenib or the anti-VEGFR2 antibody DC101) of 13-week-old 
mice with a Rip1-Tag2 model of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (RT2-PNET), which 
bear a substantial tumor burden, can transiently reduce vessel density and block tumor 
growth for about 2 to 3 weeks (response at 15 weeks) followed by reinstatement of 
neovascularization and robust tumor growth at about 4 weeks of treatment (relapse at 17 
weeks). Thus, we can evaluate true response and relapse phases in a single model (17, 19, 
26). In the polyoma middle T oncoprotein (PyMT) mammary carcinoma model (MMTV-
PyMT, also known as PyMT-BC), angiogenic blockade with DC101 alone slows down 
tumor growth with some reduction in vessel density (17), whereas NFpp10-glioblastoma 
(GBM) tumors (deficient in NF1, PTEN, and p53) are resistant to antiangiogenics, which do 
not elicit significant survival benefits (fig. S1).
Histochemical and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis of immune 
checkpoint regulators in the three tumor models revealed a substantial increase of PD-L1+ 
cells in refractory PNET and breast cancer (BC), but not in GBM (Fig. 1 and fig. S2). 
Whereas naïve PNET were devoid of PD-L1+ cells, with only a subtle increase in tumors 
undergoing DC101 treatment for 2 weeks, tumors relapsing after 4 weeks of antiangiogenic 
therapy contained about 11% PD-L1+ cells (Fig. 1A). Naïve PyMT-BC had about 8% PD-
L1+ cells that doubled after 2 weeks of DC101 therapy (Fig. 1A). Tumor cells (TCs) were 
the predominant source of PD-L1+ cells in both tumor types, although endothelial cells 
(ECs) also expressed PD-L1, which increased during treatment in RT2-PNET and MMTV-
PyMT tumors (Fig. 1A and fig. S2). In addition, a small population of CD45+PD-L1+ ICs 
increased considerably in refractory RT2-PNET and MMTV-PyMT tumors (Fig. 1A and fig. 
S2). In contrast, CD45+ ICs were the prevalent PD-L1 population in NFpp10-GBM without 
substantial difference in the number and composition of PD-L1+ cells upon VEGF inhibition 
(B20S) (Fig. 1). These results show that PD-L1 is induced and up-regulated by VEGF/
VEGFR inhibitors in different cell constituents in a tumor type–specific manner.
Interferon-γ increases PD-L1 during antiangiogenic therapy
Next, we sought to determine how angiogenic inhibitors increase PD-L1 in tumors. PD-L1 
expression can be induced by hypoxia via hypoxia-inducible factor 1 and by interferon-γ

 (IFNγ) (29, 30). Given that antiangiogenic therapy reduces vessel density resulting in 
enlarged areas of low oxygen tension, we evaluated the percentage of hypoxic cells that 
displayed PD-L1 expression by staining tumor tissue sections for PD-L1 and the hypoxia-
regulated gene carboxic anhydrase IX (CA9) (Fig. 2A) (31). Although tumor hypoxia 
increased after VEGF blockade in all three model systems, only 2 to 6% of all CA9+ cells 
were PD-L1+, indicating that hypoxia is not a major cause of PD-L1 up-regulation during 
antiangiogenic therapy (Fig. 2A). Congruently, hypoxic TCs and ECs from the three 
different models did not induce PD-L1 in vitro, and bone marrow–derived cells increased 
PD-L1 after only several hours (fig. S3). In contrast, administration of IFNγ strongly up-
regulated PD-L1 in all cell types (fig. S3). Because IFNγ is predominantly expressed by 
activated infiltrating T lymphocytes, we isolated CD3+CD4+ and CD3+CD8+ cells from 
RT2-PNET, PyMT-BC, and NFpp10-GBM tumors in untreated mice and those treated with 
DC101 or B20S for 2 weeks and determined the percentage of IFNγ+ cells in these 
populations. IFNγ+CD8+ and IFNγ+CD4+ cells increased by about twofold upon treatment 
in RT2-PNET and PyMT-BC, but only IFNγ+CD8+ modestly increased by about 50% in 
GBM (Fig. 2B). Concomitant with IFNγ up-regulation, we observed a two- to threefold 
increase of granzyme B+ (GzB+) CD8+ cells in RT2-PNET and PyMT-BC upon treatment, 
indicative of enhanced CD8 activity, whereas NFpp10-GBM tumors contained a low 
percentage of GzB+CD8+ cells, which only moderately increased after B20S treatment (Fig. 
2C). To test whether increased IFNγ was responsible for the increase in PD-L1 during 
antiangiogenic therapy, we isolated PD-L1+ cells from untreated and anti-VEGF/VEGFR–
treated tumors of all three tumor models and sorted them into TCs, ECs, and CD45+ ICs. We 
then investigated the expression profile of three well-known IFNγ-inducible genes: the 
chemokine Cxcl10, Mx1 (interferon-induced guanosine 5′-triphosphate–binding protein 
MX1), and Ifit3 (interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats) (32). Not only 
was the expression of all three genes higher in PD-L1+ TCs, ECs, and ICs of RT2-PNET and 
PyMT-BC compared to their PD-L1− counterparts, but VEGF/VEGFR inhibition also 
substantially increased their expression in PD-L1+ cells, despite having little overall impact 
on their expression in PD-L1− cell constituents (Fig. 2D). Congruent with the modest 
cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activity in NFpp10-GBM, the IFNγ response in these tumors 
was more heterogeneous and subtle. Although PD-L1+ TCs exhibited increased expression 
of Cxcl10, Mx1, and Ifit3 upon B20S treatment, they comprised only about 2% of all PD-
L1+ cells in GBM (Figs. 1 and 2D). Overall, GBM PD-L1+ ECs and ICs did not display a 
significant increase of IFNγ-induced genes upon anti-VEGF therapy, and some of these PD-
L1− cells already had greater expression compared to PD-L1− cells from pancreatic and 
breast tumors (Fig. 2D). Together, these results suggest that PD-L1 expression is increased 
by IFNγ-producing T lymphocytes during VEGF/VEGFR blockade and that the extent of 
PD-L1 up-regulation correlated with the degree of enhanced CTL activity in the tumors, 
which was highest in PyMT-BC and RT2-PNET but rather negligible in GBM.
Anti–PD-L1 therapy sustains response to VEGF blockade in PNET and BC but not in GBM
Our data suggested that the IFNγ response in tumors undergoing antiangiogenic therapy 
elicits a negative and a positive feedback loop. It enhances the differentiation of activated 
TH1 cells to cause an immunestimulating environment but also induces PD-L1 expression 
that blunts CD8 activity by binding to its receptor PD-1 on T cells, thereby rendering tumors

 more immunosuppressive. Therefore, we speculated that inhibition of PD-L1 may be 
sufficient to prolong an antitumor response during antiangiogenic therapy. To test this 
proposition, we treated 13-week-old RT2-PNET mice with DC101 or anti–PD-L1 alone or 
in combination and analyzed tumors after 2 and 4 weeks. After 2 weeks (at 15 weeks of age) 
with DC101, tumor burden was reduced compared to that of immunoglobulin G (IgG)–
treated control mice and anti–PD-L1–treated mice, which succumbed to disease around 15 
to 16 weeks of age. After 4 weeks of DC101 treatment, tumors became refractory, as 
characterized by increased tumor burden (Fig. 3A). In contrast, combined antiangiogenic/
anti–PD-L1 therapy impaired tumor regrowth and resulted in a low tumor burden after 4 
weeks, which was comparable to 2 weeks of DC101 monotherapy (Fig. 3A). Congruently, 
combination therapy substantially prolonged overall survival of RT2-PNET mice, whereas 
DC101 alone only increased progression-free survival, reminiscent of the effects of 
angiogenic inhibitors in many patients (Fig. 3A and fig. S4) (18). Congruent with our 
observation that PD-L1+ cells were rather low in naïve PNET, anti–PD-L1 monotherapy did 
little to affect the survival of RT2-PNET mice (Fig. 3A and fig. S4). Next, we tested the 
different treatment combinations in MMTV-PyMT mice. In contrast to the PNET model, 
DC101 did not elicit a distinct response and a relapse phase in MMTV-PyMT mice but 
slowed down tumor growth by about 30% (Fig. 3A). Naïve PyMT-BC contain PD-L1+ cells, 
and anti–PD-L1 therapy provoked an intermediate response similar to DC101 (Fig. 3A and 
fig. S4). Moreover, combinatorial treatment of DC101 and anti–PD-L1 was sufficient to 
substantially restrict tumor growth (Fig. 3A and fig. S4). Finally, we compared 
antiangiogenic/anti–PD-L1 therapy to the single-treatment modalities in the orthotopic 
NFpp10-GBM model. Treatment started 10 days after intracranial tumor inoculation. IgG-
treated GBM mice and mice undergoing single or combination treatment with B20S and 
anti–PD-L1 had a median survival of about 26 to 30 days (Fig. 3A and fig. S4). Therefore, in 
contrast to the improved efficacy of combined neutralization of VEGF/VEGR2 and PD-L1 
in the PNET and BC models, anti–PD-L1 therapy was insufficient to sensitize GBM to anti-
VEGF therapy.
Therapy-induced tumor response depends on forming an immunostimulatory milieu
Congruent with our observation that PI3K activation in tumor-infiltrating CD11b+ cells 
elicited an immunosuppressive environment and rendered tumors nonresponsive to 
antiangiogenic therapy (17), we found a substantial increase of pS6 kinase–positive myeloid 
cells in DC101 refractory PNET tumors, whereas pS6 kinase–positive myeloid cells in 
DC101/anti–PD-L1–treated tumors remained low, comparable to responding tumors (Fig. 
3B). Similarly, DC101, but not DC101/anti–PD-L1 treatment, increased the number of pS6 
kinase–positive myeloid cells in PyMT mice in relapsing tumors (D 17W, Fig. 3B). 
Combination B20S/anti–PD-L1–treated NFpp10-GBM had a somewhat lower number of 
pS6 kinase+CD11b+ cells compared to those treated with monotherapies, but this was not 
sufficient to affect survival (Fig. 3, A and B). In support, the expression of 
immunostimulatory genes was higher than that of immunosuppressive genes in responding, 
but not relapsing, tumors in all three models (fig. S5A). To further characterize the extent of 
altered tumor immunity, we evaluated the number and activity of intratumoral T cells in 
different treatment settings (Fig. 3C). In response to DC101, the numbers of infiltrating 
CD8+ T cells increased in RT2-PNET and then dropped to levels comparable to untreated

 tumors during relapse. Concomitantly, CD8+ T cells isolated from responding, but not from 
untreated or relapsing, tumors exhibited increased amounts of GzB and IFNγ proteins (Fig. 
3C and fig. S5B). Numbers and activity of CD8+ T cells were also increased in PyMT-BC 
undergoing combination therapy, but not in GBM (Fig. 3C and fig. S5B). Finally, we found 
that enhanced CD8+ T cell activity closely correlated with enhanced apoptosis in 
responding, but not refractory, tumors in all three tumor models (Fig. 3, C and D, and fig. 
S5C). Together, these results revealed that antiangiogenic therapy could sensitize tumors to 
anti–PD-L1 therapy only when sufficient activated cytotoxic T cells infiltrated the tumors. 
Thus, anti-VEGF/VEGFR + anti–PD-L1 therapy improved outcome in RT2-PNET and 
MMTV-PyMT, but not in GBM. These results confirm a recent observation that the extent of 
intratumoral T cell infiltration and activation in tumors determines the response to PD-L1 
blockade (33). DCs are a major source of antigen-presenting cells that activate CD8+ T cells, 
and we identified a substantial increase in DC number and activity (measured by dendritic 
Cd40, Il10, and Il12 expression) in RT2-PNET and PyMT-BC, but not GBM, undergoing 
antiangiogenic/anti–PD-L1 combination therapy (Fig. 4, A and B) (34, 35). Consequently, 
enhanced intratumoral CD8+T cell activity, measured by perforin and GzB expression, was 
observed in RT2-PNET and PyMT-BC, but again not in GBM (Figs. 3C and 4C).
PD-L1 blockade enhances vessel normalization during anti-VEGF therapy in PNET and BC 
but not in GBM
The combination treatment with anti-VEGF/VEGFR2 and anti–PD-L1 antibodies stimulated 
both innate and adaptive IC activation in RT2-PNET and PyMT mice but not in GBM, likely 
due to the lack of significant T cell infiltration and activation. We wanted to determine why 
T cells infiltrate PNET and PyMT-BC, but not GBM. A major obstacle for T cell 
extravasation is the tumor vasculature that restrains intratumoral lymphocyte infiltration and 
fosters an immunosuppressive microenvironment, which enables tumors to evade host 
immunosurveillance (8). We therefore hypothesized that differing alterations of the tumor 
vasculature may be in part responsible for the distinct outcome of antiangiogenic/anti–PD-
L1 therapy in the different tumor models.
Analysis of DC101-treated RT2-PNET during the response phase revealed about 50% 
reduction in vessel density, whereas tumors relapsing from DC101 displayed a vessel 
density similar to IgG-treated tumors (Fig. 5A). Addition of anti–PD-L1 maintained the low 
vessel density, thus sustaining the response to DC101 (Fig. 5A). In PyMT and in GBM-
bearing mice, VEGF/VEGFR2 inhibition alone or combined with anti–PD-L1 also reduced 
vessel density in tumors, although the effects in GBM appeared more moderate (Fig. 5A). 
Congruently, antiangiogenic/anti–PD-L1 treatment increased angiostatic activity of 
intratumoral myeloid cells in responding tumors (fig. S6). Given that anti-VEGF/VEGFR2 
therapy enhances pericyte coverage and normalizes tumor vessels (36–38), we found that all 
three tumor types that exhibited reduced vessel density during VEGF/VEGFR2 blockade, 
alone or combined with anti–PD-L1, also displayed tumor vessels with increased NG2+ and 
desmin+ pericyte coverage (Fig. 5B). However, these normalization effects were much more 
prominent in RT2-PNET and MMTV-PyMT than in NFpp10-GBM.

 Therapy-induced vessel and IC changes are associated with formation of high endothelial 
venules
We also observed morphological changes in several areas of the tumor vasculature of 
MMTV-PyMT and RT2-PNET during antiangiogenic/anti–PD-L1 therapy. The vessels 
appeared thickened with plump ECs rather than the flat ECs of the tumor microvasculature, 
displaying typical morphological features of high endothelial venules (HEVs) (Fig. 5, C and 
D). Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that these blood vessels were recognized by 
MECA79, a well-established antibody that binds all HEVs through a specific carbohydrate 
epitope but does not react with postcapillary venules, capillaries, or arteries (Fig. 5, C and 
D) (39). Notably, MECA79+ vessels exhibited a range of morphological endothelial 
transformations, and not all displayed plump endothelial appearance, likely reflecting 
intratumoral heterogeneity in morphology and potential functionality (Fig. 5, C and D, and 
movies S1 to S3). MECA79+ vessels were induced only upon DC101/anti–PD-L1 treatment 
in RT2-PNET, whereas about 20% of tumor vessels in IgG-treated PyMT tumors already 
expressed MECA79, and this number nearly tripled after combination therapy. In contrast, 
none of the treatment modalities were able to significantly induce HEVs in GBM (Fig. 5C).
HEV formation is associated with increased lymphocyte infiltration and activation
These results support the proposition that the beneficial effects of antiangiogenic/anti–PD-
L1 therapy may be dependent on intratumoral HEV formation. HEVs are specialized 
postcapillary venules with portals through which blood-borne lymphocytes enter into 
secondary lymphoid organs (39, 40). Thus, we hypothesized that therapy-induced 
intratumoral HEVs may have functional similarities to normal HEVs in lymph nodes and 
enhance T cell infiltration in tumors, thus facilitating an improved tumor response to 
antiangiogenic/anti–PD-L1 therapy. Lymphocyte assessment revealed a rather sparse 
distribution of B and T lymphocytes around MECA79− tumor vessels, whereas we observed 
a 3- to 10-fold increase in the numbers of T and B lymphocytes in the periphery of 
MECA79+ HEVs in both PyMT-BC and RT2-PNET across all cohorts (Fig. 6A).
A recent transcriptional profiling analysis revealed a molecular signature that distinguishes 
HEVs from capillary endothelium derived from normal lymphoid organs (41). A subset of 
these genes is transcriptionally induced by the lymphotoxin β receptor (LTβR)/noncanonical 
nuclear factor κB (NFκB) signaling pathway as depicted in Fig. 6B. Among these are genes 
that code for chemokines and cytokines implicated in lymphocyte recruitment and migration 
(Fig. 6C; “EC”) of which we found some to be significantly up-regulated in ECs of RT2-
PNET and PyMT-BC, but not GBM, during combined VEGF/VEGFR2 and PD-L1 
neutralization (Fig. 6C). As shown in the schematic, the expression of these factors is in part 
induced by LTβR, which binds lymphotoxin (LTα1β2) or LIGHT (homologous to 
lymphotoxin, exhibits inducible expression, and competes with herpes simplex virus 
glycoprotein D for herpes virus entry mediator, a receptor expressed by T lymphocytes). 
Notably, although LIGHT-expressing DCs are required and sufficient for the induction and 
maintenance of HEVs in normal lymphoid tissues, LIGHT and LTα/β can be induced by a 
variety of ICs besides DCs, including B and T cells (39, 42–44).

 LTβR signaling is implicated in HEV formation during antiangiogenic/anti–PD-L1 therapy
Although it remains to be determined which signaling pathways induce HEVs in cancers, 
the induction of several LTβR-regulated factors, including its ligand LIGHT in HEV+ 
tumors upon combinatorial treatment (Fig. 6C), suggested that LTβR signaling may also be 
implicated in the formation and function of intratumoral HEVs. As a proof of principle, we 
used two commercially available antibodies: an agonistic antibody that activates LTβR and 
an antagonistic antibody to block its activation (Fig. 7A) (45–47). LTβR antagonist or 
agonist treatment had no direct effects on TCs (fig. S7). Addition of the LTβR agonist 
during 2 weeks of antiangiogenic/anti–PD-L1 therapy doubled and quadrupled the HEV 
formation in PyMT-BC (Fig. 7B) and RT2-PNET (fig. S8A), respectively. HEV numbers in 
the different treatment arms correlated well with the infiltration and activity of CD8+ T cells, 
being highest after combination treatment with LTβR agonist and lowest after combination 
with the LTβR antagonist (Fig. 7, C and D, and fig. S8B). Tumor burden in RT2-PNET mice 
was lower compared to control groups but not significantly different among therapy groups 
due to the short treatment duration (fig. S8C). In contrast, the LTβR antagonist reduced HEV 
back to baseline in naïve PyMT tumors and completely abrogated HEVs in RT2-PNET (Fig. 
7B and fig. S8D). Of note, LTβR activation alone gave rise to HEVs, although not as much 
as in combination with antiangiogenic immunotherapy, whereas the LTβR antagonist 
completely blocked HEV formation in both tumor types (fig. S8, D and E). Notably, addition 
of the LTβR agonist not only further increased HEV numbers, but also increased 
lymphocyte infiltration per HEV, suggesting that LTβR signaling contributes to the 
maturation and functionality of intratumoral HEV (fig. S8, F and G). As a consequence, 
there was an increase in apoptosing cells and necrotic areas in the double-treated tumors that 
were further enhanced by addition of the LTβR agonist, whereas addition of antagonist 
decreased apoptosis and had no effect on necrosis (Fig. 7, E and F). Finally, long-term 
treatment of PyMT mice with anti-VEGFR2/anti–PD-L1 combination alone or in the 
presence of LTβR agonist resulted in tumor stasis, whereas treatment of PyMT mice with 
IgG was terminated at 3 weeks because of excessive tumor burden (Fig. 7G). The fact that 
treated tumors exhibited substantial necrosis that still was not cleared efficiently after 3 
weeks may explain why tumor sizes did not differ between both combinatorial treatments 
(Fig. 7F). Together, these results revealed that LTβR signaling contributes to tumor HEV 
generation and that its activation, as assessed by the HEV signature profile, may be more 
prominent in PyMT-BC than in RT2-PNET undergoing anti-VEGFR2/anti–PD-L1 therapy.
Activation of LTβR signaling in GBM facilitates a response to combined anti–PD-L1 and 
anti-VEGF therapy by inducing HEVs
The results of our study imply that antiangiogenic/anti–PD-L1 therapy failed in GBM 
because HEVs did not form to provide sufficient T cell infiltration and activation. If HEV 
formation is a key mediator of tumor response, then imposed HEV development in GBM 
should sensitize the tumors to the therapy. LTβR activation during antiangiogenic/anti–PD-
L1 therapy altered about 15% of tumor vessels into HEVs (Fig. 7H). This was in 
concordance with a nearly 10-fold increase of GzB+-activated CD8+ cells in GBM (Fig. 7I). 
Neither LTβR activation alone nor antiangiogenic/anti–PD-L1 treatment affected tumor 
growth, but the combination of both treatment modalities reduced tumor burden by more 
than 60% (Fig. 7J). These results revealed that recalcitrant tumors, such as GBM, can be

can be therapeutically induced.

Here and in a companion study in this issue by Schmittnaegel et al. (48), we describe the up-
regulation of PD-L1, the ligand of the negative checkpoint regulator PD-1 found on T cells, 
as an adaptive immunosuppressive mechanism that limited the efficacy of antiangiogenic 
agents. Thus, although T cells become activated, expressing IFNγ during successful 
antiangiogenic therapy, a negative feedback loop was created by inducing PD-L1 and by 
blunting T cell activity. Concurrent blockade of angiogenesis and PD-L1 had improved 
efficacy and prolonged survival when HEVs were induced in tumors, facilitating enhanced T 
cell infiltration and activation and producing successful eradication of malignant cells.
Mechanistically, the combination therapy can directly counteract the therapy-induced 
adaptive immunosuppressive pathway (PD-L1 up-regulation) by CTL-secreted IFNγ, but it 
is also conceivable that it unleashes the generation and expansion of new CTLs generated 
during antiangiogenic therapy, which are then suppressed by PD-L1/PD-1 checkpoint 
regulation. The negative feedback loop, entailing the interaction of adaptive ICs with PD-
L1+ tumor and host cells, is in line with our former observation (17) that the efficacy of 
VEGF/VEGFR inhibitors depended on forming an immunostimulatory environment, in part 
by converting innate ICs to an angiostatic and immunostimulatory phenotype. Moreover, 
tumors consistently reinforce mechanisms that reinitiate angiogenesis and escape 
immunosurveillance, in part by activating PI3Kγ in intratumoral myeloid cells, resulting in 
tumor relapse (17). The reinstated immunosuppression mediated by PI3Kγ+ myeloid cells 
was also described as a resistance mechanism to CTLA-4 or PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors (49) 
and supports our finding that response to antiangiogenic/anti–PD-L1 therapy is associated 
with a low number of PI3Kγ-activated tumor-associated innate ICs. Further confirmation 
stems from a clinical study in which enhanced PD-L1 expression and an immunosuppressive 
tumor microenvironment correlated with resistance to angiogenic inhibitors in metastatic 
renal cell carcinomas (50). Together, these results support the notion that antiangiogenic 
therapy causes both adaptive and innate immune responses in tumors to overcome growth 
restrictions and escape immunosurveillance. Our results also show that antiangiogenic 
therapy can sensitize PD-L1− tumors to checkpoint blockade by inducing PD-L1 expression 
in tumors.
Naïve RT2-PNET expressed very low amounts of PD-L1, and therefore, anti–PD-L1 
monotherapy had no effect in RT2-PNET mice, whereas combined VEGFR2/PD-L1 
inhibition produced sustained response and prolonged survival. In light of these results, it is 
tempting to speculate that there may be a threshold fraction of PD-L1+ cells in tumors that is 
required to produce anti–PD-L1 therapeutic efficacy and that inhibition of PD-L1+ TCs may 
convey stronger responses than targeting PD-L1+ host cells. Retrospective clinical studies 
have shown correlations between tumor PD-L1 expression and response to PD-1/PD-L1 
checkpoint blockade therapy (51, 52). In addition, sufficient T cell infiltration in human 
tumors appeared to be a rate-limiting step for responses to PD-L1 blockade (33, 53). 
Concordantly, combined antiangiogenic/anti–PD-L1 therapy improved the antitumor

 response and resulted in higher T cell infiltration than the single-treatment arms. Moreover, 
the lack of T cell infiltration was correlated with an ineffective response to combined 
antiangiogenic/anti–PD-L1 therapy in GBM. These findings support a recent study 
indicating that adequate T cell infiltration, rather than PD-L1 expression, determines tumor 
response to checkpoint inhibitors (33). Thus, we wanted to identify the determining factor 
for sufficient T cell infiltration into tumors.
The tumor vasculature is a major barrier for lymphocytes because it also up-regulates PD-L1 
and down-regulates the lymphocyte adhesion molecules ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 that together 
hinder T cell activation and infiltration into the tumor (9, 11). Consequently, tumor-
infiltrating T cells are generally absent or sparse in tumors; however, their presence is 
prognostic and predictive of response to standard therapies in many tumor types (54, 55). 
Because intratumoral CD8+ T cell infiltration is a rate-limiting step for therapeutic success, 
the question arises whether modulation of the immunosuppressive vasculature would be a 
suitable strategy to enhance CTL infiltration and subsequent eradication of TCs. In line with 
this concept, antiangiogenic therapy normalizes tumor blood vessels, albeit transiently, 
resulting in better blood and oxygen flow and possibly also more efficient T cell 
extravasation from the blood into the tumor (56, 57). We found that vessel normalization by 
VEGF/VEGFR inhibitors alone modestly enhanced T cell infiltration (17), but 
transformation of tumor blood vessels into HEVs substantially increased lymphocyte 
infiltration. Recent studies have discovered that various human cancers can spontaneously 
develop areas of HEVs and that their presence correlates with reduced tumor size and 
improved patient outcome (58, 59). Collectively, therapeutic induction of HEVs with 
antiangiogenic/anti–PD-L1 therapy promoted antitumor immunity by recruiting more 
activated lymphocytes into the tumor, thus allowing the local generation and expansion of 
tumor-destroying lymphocytes that formed centers around HEVs, being reminiscent of 
tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS).
With regard to the underlying mechanisms of HEV induction in tumors, what is currently 
known is that CD11c+ DCs appear to be essential for the maintenance of HEVs in lymphoid 
organs (39). DCs and other ICs, including activated T cells, express lymphotoxins (LTα1β2 
or LIGHT) that stimulate the LTβR in ECs to induce the expression of various chemokines 
and vascular-associated adhesion molecules, which drive HEV formation and T cell 
recruitment during development (39, 42–44). Ablation of DCs, pharmacological inhibition, 
or genetic deletion of LTβR in ECs is sufficient to impair formation of HEVs in lymphoid 
organs (43, 60, 61). Multiple lines of evidence indicate that LTβR signaling may also be 
involved in the regulation of the HEV phenotype and function in tumors undergoing 
antiangiogenic/anti–PD-L1 therapy. First, several endothelial-derived factors, identified in a 
HEV signature and induced by LTβR, are up-regulated during antiangiogenic/anti–PD-L1 
therapy in HEV+ tumors (41, 62). Second, LIGHT is substantially induced in DCs of HEV+ 
tumors undergoing combination therapy, although this does not reflect the absolute levels of 
all lymphotoxin ligands in the tumor. Third, an LTβR agonist could further enhance HEV 
formation, whereas an LTβR antagonist lowered and even blocked HEV formation in breast 
and pancreatic tumors, respectively, undergoing antiangiogenic/anti–PD-L1 therapy.

 Notably, activation of LTβR was sufficient to induce HEVs and enhance intratumoral 
activated T cells in GBM and thereby sensitized tumors to antiangiogenic/anti–PD-L1 
therapy. These results are encouraging and supported by recent findings that addition of an 
engineered LIGHT protein to anti–PD-L1 therapy enhanced T cell infiltration and prevented 
resistance to PD-L1 blockade (33). Recently, intratumoral delivery of a LIGHT peptide was 
able to normalize tumor vessels and improve tumor perfusion by reestablishing tight 
pericyte-vessel alignment (63). These studies support the hypothesis that vascular 
normalization may be a first step to promote HEV formation. Together, these data suggest 
that antiangiogenic/anti–PD-L1 therapy generates an immunestimulating environment that 
induces LTβR signaling and, together with vascular normalization, triggers HEV formation. 
These results also raise more questions specifically with regard to termination of therapy, 
which we have not addressed. How stable are intratumoral HEVs and will the composition 
and nature of surrounding lymphocytes forming TLS change? If HEVs are solely gates of 
lymphocyte entry, would then infiltrating ICs become immunosuppressive again, or is an 
immunestimulating environment also a key for the formation of HEVs and subsequent TLS? 
In support of this hypothesis, a different RT2 line derived from an independent transgene 
insertion (Rip1-Tag5), produces an immune response to T antigen, which is associated with 
the formation of HEV-like structures in islets and tumors (64).
To date, our preclinical studies provide evidence that anti–PD-1 or anti–PD-L1 therapy can 
sensitize and prolong efficacy of antiangiogenic therapy, and conversely, antiangiogenic 
therapy can improve anti–PD-L1 treatment by supporting vascular changes, such as vessel 
normalization and HEV formation, that facilitate enhanced CTL infiltration, activity, and TC 
destruction. Thus, combined antiangiogenic and checkpoint inhibitors should generate more 
durable effects and likely sensitize resistant tumors to antiangiogenic therapy when 
intratumoral HEVs are formed. Several clinical trials combining angiogenic inhibitors and 
checkpoint blockers are ongoing, and some have produced encouraging results. For example, 
a small phase 1 study combining the immune checkpoint antibody ipilimumab with the 
angiogenesis inhibitor antibody bevacizumab showed promising results in advanced 
melanoma patients with durable patient responses for more than 6 months (65–67). These 
favorable outcomes were associated with increased expression of the adhesion molecules 
ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 in ECs and lymphocyte infiltration (68). Because these results are 
congruent with our observations, it is intriguing to speculate that the formation of 
intratumoral HEVs, which abundantly express ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 adhesion molecules, 
may be responsible for the enhanced lymphocyte infiltration observed in these patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design
The aim of the study was to assess the impact of the combined antiangiogenic/
immunotherapy in solid tumors. Angiogenesis inhibitors are used as standard therapy in 
many cancers and can act as major immune modulators (2), and we examined how they 
affect tumor response to immune checkpoint therapy and particularly how the PD-1/PD-L1 
axis regulates CTL suppression. The efficacy of antiangiogenic and anti–PD-L1 combination 
alone or with LTβR agonists/antagonists was evaluated in mice bearing pancreatic

 neuroendocrine tumors (RT2-PNET), mammary carcinomas (MMTV-PyMT), or 
glioblastoma (NFpp10-GBM). Whereas RT2-PNET respond well, but transiently, to 
antiangiogenic therapy, MMTV-PyMT and NFpp10-GBM–bearing mice only modestly 
responded to angiogenic inhibitors (17). Sample size was determined with the University of 
California, San Francisco (UCSF) Biostatistics and Computational Biology Core to reach 
statistical significance for tumor burden and mouse survival, which were the primary 
outcomes used to assess the efficacy of combination therapy. These data were supported by 
flow cytometry analysis, immunofluorescence staining, and gene expression analysis of the 
intratumoral immune compartment (T cells, DCs, and myeloid cells) to examine the global 
immune signature of the tumor response.
Time points for analyses were preselected based on the expected window of efficacy (after 2 
weeks of treatment) for single and combination therapy in all models and based on the 
expected window of antiangiogenic resistance (after 4 weeks of treatment) in the RT2 
model. Data include all outliers. Age-matched mice were randomly assigned to experimental 
cohorts. Biological replicates for cohorts are indicated by n in figure legends. Three 
independent trials were performed for each tumor model. All animal studies were reviewed 
and approved by the UCSF Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
Tumor models and preclinical trials
RT2-PNET mice (69) were maintained as heterozygotes in the C57BL/6 background, with 
sucrose-enriched diet starting at 12 weeks of age. Treatment with control rat IgG2a (40 
mg/kg; Bio X cell, #BE0089) or DC101 (anti-VEGFR2, 40 mg/kg; Bio X cell, #BE0060) 
with or without anti–PD-L1 (10 mg/kg; Bio X cell, #BE0101) was initiated at 13 weeks of 
age and administered twice a week until the mice reached the age of 15 or 17 weeks. For 
MMTV-PyMT experiments, 100,000 syngeneic PyMT breast TCs (provided by Z. Werb at 
UCSF) were implanted into the fourth mammary fat pad of female FVB/n mice at 6 to 8 
weeks of age. When tumors reached a volume of 250 mm3, PyMT mice were treated twice a 
week for 2 weeks or longer with rat IgG2a or DC101 alone or in combination with anti–PD-
L1, with or without anti-LTβR agonist (2 mg/kg) (Abcam, #ab65089) or antagonist (Tebu-
Bio, #14971122). For brain tumor experiments, 200,000 NFpp10-GBM TCs (provided by I. 
Verma at Salk Institute), generated from embryonic C57B/L6 neural stem cells infected with 
shP53-shNF1 and shPTEN-containing lentiviral vectors (70), were implanted intracranially 
into the striatum of 7- to 9- week-old female and male syngeneic C57BL/6 mice. One week 
after implantation, mouse IgG1 (15 mg/kg; Thermo Fischer Scientific, #SA1-35641) or 
B20S (15 mg/kg; see the Supplementary Materials) treatments with or without anti–PD-L1 
or anti-LTβR agonist (2 mg/kg) were administered twice a week for 2 to 4 weeks. For more 
experimental details, see the Supplementary Materials.
Statistical analyses
Statistical analyses were performed under the guidance of the Helen Diller Family 
Comprehensive Cancer Biostatistics and Computational Biology Core using GraphPad 
Prism (GraphPad software). For mouse survival studies, P values were calculated using the 
log-rank test. For tumor burden, immunostaining, and multicolor flow cytometry, P values 
were calculated using the nonparametric Mann-Whitney test because sample sizes were
