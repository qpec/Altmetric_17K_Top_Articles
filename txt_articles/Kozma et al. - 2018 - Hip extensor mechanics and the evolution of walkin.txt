The evolutionary emergence of humans’ remarkably economical
walking gait remains a focus of research and debate, but experi-
mentally validated approaches linking locomotor capability to
postcranial anatomy are limited. In this study, we integrated 3D
morphometrics of hominoid pelvic shape with experimental mea-
surements of hip kinematics and kinetics during walking and
climbing, hamstring activity, and passive range of hip extension
in humans, apes, and other primates to assess arboreal–terrestrial
trade-offs in ischium morphology among living taxa. We show
that hamstring-powered hip extension during habitual walking
and climbing in living apes and humans is strongly predicted,
and likely constrained, by the relative length and orientation of
the ischium. Ape pelves permit greater extensor moments at the
hip, enhancing climbing capability, but limit their range of hip
extension, resulting in a crouched gait. Human pelves reduce hip
extensor moments but permit a greater degree of hip extension,
which greatly improves walking economy (i.e., distance traveled/
energy consumed). Applying these results to fossil pelves suggests
that early hominins differed from both humans and extant apes in
having an economical walking gait without sacrificing climbing
capability. Ardipithecus was capable of nearly human-like hip ex-
tension during bipedal walking, but retained the capacity for
powerful, ape-like hip extension during vertical climbing. Hip ex-
tension capability was essentially human-like in Australopithecus
afarensis and Australopithecus africanus, suggesting an economi-
cal walking gait but reduced mechanical advantage for powered
hip extension during climbing.

A
lthough there is broad consensus that early hominins walked
bipedally when on the ground (1–3), it is unclear when, and
under what conditions, hominins developed an economical
human-like gait, and whether adaptations for improved walking
economy resulted in reduced climbing ability (1–6). Resolving
this central debate in human evolution is hampered by tradi-
tional analytical approaches, which provide rich comparative
detail about a fossil taxon’s skeletal morphology but rarely vali-
date functional inferences against experimental tests in living
humans and apes. Recent studies have demonstrated the value of
integrating anatomical and experimental analyses to reconstruct
the walking mechanics and energetics of fossil hominins, but
to date they have drawn solely from human experimental data
(7) or relied on taxonomically limited comparisons (e.g., with
chimpanzees) (8–12); none has examined the effects of these
traits on climbing capabilities. More detailed anatomical analy-
ses have identified a suite of features in early hominins associ-
ated with climbing (2, 4–6), but have not empirically validated
their effects on climbing performance or tested whether these
traits constrain walking and running performance.
Human bipedalism relies on a suite of hind limb adaptations,
including a laterally oriented iliac blade and hip abductor com-
plex, adducted hallux, and stiff midfoot (13), but few of these
features have been linked empirically and in vivo to locomotor
economy (i.e., the distance traveled per unit energy consumed).
One derived feature tentatively tied to humans’ remarkable
walking economy is a shorter and more dorsally projecting is-
chium, which permits hip extensor muscle torque production at
full extension of the hip (180° hip angle between the trunk and
leg) (4, 9, 14–16) (Fig. 1). The resulting straight-legged gait
substantially improves walking economy compared with non-
human apes by reducing the muscle activity needed to support
body weight each step (8, 9). Conversely, the shorter human is-
chium likely reduces the mechanical advantage of hip extensors
(hamstring muscles) relative to apes and other nonhuman pri-
mates, especially in the flexed-hip postures needed to propel the
Significance
The evolution of humans’ distinct bipedal gait remains a focus
of research and debate. Many reconstructions of hominin lo-
comotor evolution assume climbing capability trades off
against walking economy, with improvement in one requiring
diminishment of the other, but few have tested these func-
tional inferences experimentally. In this study, we integrate
experimental locomotor mechanics from humans and other
primates with osteological measurements to assess the loco-
motor capabilities of early hominins. Our analyses show that
changes in the ischium and hamstrings would have made
walking more economical without reducing the utility of these
muscles for climbing in early hominins. A wider set of evolu-
tionary solutions may have been available to early hominins
than previously recognized.

 body upward during climbing (moving up a substrate inclined at
45° or more to the horizontal) (14–18). It remains unclear,
however, whether ischial morphology actually limits hip exten-
sion in nonhuman apes as proposed, or whether changes in is-
chial morphology in the hominin lineage reflect arboreal–
terrestrial trade-offs in hip extensor mechanics (4, 8, 9, 14–18).
In this study, we investigated early hominin ischial morphol-
ogy, using an integrated anatomical-experimental approach. We
combined in vivo biomechanical analyses of hip extension during
walking and climbing across a range of living hominoid genera
with detailed comparative pelvic anatomy to develop an experi-
mentally validated link between ischial morphology and loco-
motor mechanics. We then examined pelvic morphology in
Ardipithecus and Australopithecus to test the hypothesis that early
hominins retained ischial proportions and orientation that fa-
vored greater force production during climbing but limited their
ability to hyperextend the hip and walk as economically as
modern humans.
We characterized pelvic shape using a set of 23 3D landmarks
in living hominoids: Homo, Pan, Gorilla, Pongo, Hylobates, and
Nomascus; three early hominins: Ardipithecus ramidus, Austral-
opithecus afarensis, and Australopithecus africanus; and a Mio-
cene ape, Ekembo nyanzae (Methods and SI Appendix, Fig.
S1 and Tables S1 and S2). For greater phylogenetic breadth, we
also included smaller samples of five large-bodied Old World
monkey genera (Mandrillus, Papio, Procolobus, Colobus, and
Macaca) and four New World monkey genera (Ateles, Lagothrix,
Cebus, and Alouatta; Methods and SI Appendix, Table S1). The
length and orientation of the ischium were combined with femur
lengths for each specimen to determine the dimensionless me-
chanical advantage (DMA) for the hamstring muscles (in this
study, the semimembranosus, semitendinosus, and biceps femo-
ris longus, but not the biceps femoris brevis), which act to extend
the hip. DMA for these muscles, calculated as (muscle moment
arm)/(femur length), represents the moment, or rotational force,
generated at the distal femur for a given unit of hamstring ten-
sion, and changes as a function of hip angle (Fig. 1). Plotting
DMA against hip angle produces a performance envelope for the
hamstring muscles that circumscribes the effective range of hip
flexion for these muscles and the hip angle at which they can
produce the most torque (Fig. 2). Estimated this way, maximum
DMA is determined by the ratio of (ischial length)/(femur
length), whereas the range of hamstrings-powered hip extension
(i.e., range of hip angles for which DMA >0) is determined by
ischial orientation (Methods and Fig. 1). These calculations are
independent of body mass, and thus do not rely on estimates of
body size.
To test whether hamstring performance envelopes are reliable
indicators of locomotor capabilities, we compared these enve-
lopes with ranges of hip extension during level quadrupedal
walking and vertical climbing in nonhuman apes, as well as bi-
pedal walking in humans; kinetic data for humans, chimpanzees,
and bonobos; electromyographic recordings of hamstring activity
in humans, chimpanzees, bonobos, and hylobatids; and passive
ranges of hip extension in hominoids and other primates. We
then examined hamstring DMA envelopes in our fossil sample to
reconstruct their walking and climbing mechanics. Sensitivity
analyses were performed to ensure that differences in recon-
structed DMA envelopes were robust to variation imposed by
measurement error and uncertainty in pelvic orientation (i.e.,
pelvic tilt in the sagittal plane), femur length, hamstrings at-
tachment, or sacral width.
Results
Extant Taxa. Anatomical analyses clearly distinguish the ham-
strings DMA envelopes of nonhuman apes from humans. Pongo,
Gorilla, and Pan all exhibit high maximum DMA at a relatively
low range of hip angles, and are similar in these respects to ex-
tant monkeys. The orientation of the ape ischium results in a
DMA envelope constrained between 0° and ∼160° hip extension
(Fig. 2 and SI Appendix, Table S3), suggesting these taxa cannot
use their hamstrings for powered hip extension beyond ∼160°.
Their long ischia (Fig. 1) produce large hamstrings moment arms
and greater peak DMA (Fig. 2 and SI Appendix, Table S3). The
hylobatids are similar to other apes in the effective range of hip
extension, yet have relatively low peak DMA. Humans are
characterized by low DMA amplitudes (a function of a shorter
ischium; Fig. 1) and a rightward shift in the DMA envelope,
which falls between 43° ± 6° (flexed hip) and 223° ± 6° (hyper-
extended hip; Fig. 2), with a peak near 140°. Humans’ higher
range is a function of ischial orientation and allows for

Ischial morphology and hip mechanics. (A) The hamstrings muscle
group exerts a force Fm, which results in a hip extension moment Fm × r,
where r is the orthogonal distance from the Fm vector to the center of ro-
tation for the hip. The resulting force at the knee, Fk, is equal to Fm × (r/B),
where B is the orthogonal distance from the Fk vector to the center of ro-
tation for the hip. The hamstrings group inserts on the proximal tibia and
fibula, very near the knee, making femur length a useful proxy measure for
B. The ratio r/B thus gives the DMA for the hamstrings group (i.e., the force
Fk exerted at the knee for a given Fm). DMA is a function of hip flexion angle,
Φ. Greater DMA allows the hip extensors to generate greater Fk, but also
requires more shortening of the hamstrings group (i.e., muscle strain) per
degree of hip extension. This graphic presents a chimpanzee, with its highly
flexed hip. (B) Humans’ shorter and reoriented ischium results in lower peak
DMA but a greater functional range of hip extension, enabling the ham-
strings to hyperextend the hip beyond 200°, as shown here. (C) Ischial length

beyond
180°. Sensitivity
analyses show that differences in DMA envelopes between hu-
mans and nonhuman apes are robust to measurement error and
uncertainty in pelvic orientation, femur length, and hamstrings
attachment (SI Appendix, SI Text, Figs. S2 and S3, and Table S4).
Experimental analyses show that anatomically determined
DMA envelopes correspond closely with hip angles habitually
used during locomotion (Fig. 2B and SI Appendix, Table S3).
During both level quadrupedal walking and vertical climbing
(19), hip extension does not exceed 150° in nonhuman apes, and
ranges of hip flexion and extension are quite similar across these
taxa. The range of motion in the sagittal plane is greater when
climbing vertically than when walking quadrupedally, with
vertical climbing requiring a more flexed hip than walking
quadrupedally. Orangutans extend their hips more than other
apes when climbing (Fig. 2B), yet remain within their hamstrings
performance envelopes (Fig. 2A and SI Appendix, Table S3).
Similarly, although hylobatids engage in bipedalism often, they
do not extend their hips to 180° when walking quadrupedally
(Fig. 2B), walking bipedally (20), or leaping (21). In contrast,
during human walking, hip extension spans between 156° ± 4°
and 200° ± 4° (22). Humans can flex their hips as much as apes
when climbing trees (23), but nonhuman apes do not habitually
extend their hips as much as bipedal humans do.
DMA envelopes also correspond strongly with patterns of
hamstrings muscle activity and powered hip extension in humans,
chimpanzees, bonobos, and gibbons, the only hominoids for
whom these have been measured (Fig. 2 C and D and SI Ap-
pendix, Table S3) (8, 9, 24–27). Chimpanzees and bonobos ac-
tivate the hamstrings and produce hip extension moments as they
extend the hip over a range of 10–100° during vertical climbing
(90° substrate), incline climbing (45°), and level walking (0°).
Maximum hip extensor moments occur near 25° and 75° hip
extension for incline climbing and level quadrupedal walking,
respectively (Fig. 2C). In contrast, humans activate the ham-
strings group during stance phase (26) and generate extensor hip
moments over a range of ∼150–200° hip extension, outside the
ape DMA envelope (SI Appendix, Table S3). These differences
between Homo and Pan suggest that hamstrings DMA predicts
when these muscles are active and when the hip joint produces
the most torque.
As a final empirical test, we compared DMA envelope with
the range of passive hip extension, which is constrained by the
bony morphology and ligaments of the hip (28, 29). Although
DMA ranges were generally broader than in vivo ranges, mean
values of maximum hip extension from DMA envelopes closely
corresponded with published ranges of passive hip extension
measured in vivo on anesthetized apes and humans (refs. 29 and
30; Fig. 2E and SI Appendix, Table S3). Apes, particularly
orangutans, can approach 180° hip extension in their passive
range of motion (29), and occasionally during bipedal walking
(e.g., refs. 31 and 32). However, hyperextension (>180°) of the
hip, which is a critical component of straight-legged, economical
human walking, falls outside of ape capabilities, consistent with
ischium morphology.
Empirically tested differences in ischial mechanics demon-
strate a clear trade-off between walking and climbing capabilities
in living hominoids. The greater peak of great apes’ DMA en-
velopes indicates greater torque at the hip per unit of hamstrings
muscle force, permitting more powerful hip extension that may
be critical during vertical climbing and arboreal scrambling. The
lower range of apes’ DMA envelopes reflects flexed-hip postures
during walking and climbing, but prevents hamstrings-powered
hyperextension of the hip. In contrast, humans’ higher DMA
range permits powered hyperextension, an essential compo-
nent of humans’ economical striding bipedalism (8, 9, 13).
Humans’ short ischium and reduced DMA peak likely reflect the
lower power requirements of walking and may also reduce
hamstring muscle strain (i.e., shortening). Kinematic and ana-
tomical strategies to reduce muscle strain have been shown to
improve locomotor efficiency in other species (33), and reduced
hamstring strain might similarly contribute to the efficiency of
human walking.
The mechanics of hip extension in humans and apes also
provide insight into the evolution of the gluteus maximus in
hominins. In chimpanzees, orangutans, and gibbons, gluteus
maximus is much smaller than in humans and does not extend
the hamstrings’ range of powered hip extension (34–36). In hu-
mans, the gluteus maximus is greatly enlarged and serves a dis-
tinct and complementary role with the hamstrings in powering
hip extension. In human walking, hyperextension of the hip is
powered in part by the hamstrings (ref. 26; Fig. 2), and the

 gluteus maximus is notably quiet throughout stance phase (34,
35). Instead, the gluteus maximus is active when the hip is more
flexed; for example, during the early portion of stance phase
during running and climbing (34, 35). The enlarged gluteus
maximus appears to compensate for humans’ derived ischial
morphology and the reduced effectiveness of the hamstrings
when the hip is flexed, particularly at angles <40°, where the
hamstrings cannot power extension (Fig. 2).
Fossil Taxa. The overlap in DMA envelopes for monkeys and
nonhuman apes is unsurprising, given the broad similarity in
their ranges of hip extension during walking and when passively
measured in vivo (refs. 29 and 37; Fig. 2E and SI Appendix, Table
S3), and suggests this aspect of ischial mechanics may be a
primitive condition for hominoids. The only Miocene hominoid
pelvis that is sufficiently complete for this analysis, that of E.
nyanzae (38, 39), is consistent with this hypothesis, exhibiting a
DMA envelope that is broadly similar to that of monkeys and
nonhuman apes (SI Appendix, Fig. S4). Material from other
Miocene apes is needed to test this hypothesis.
Unlike extant hominoids, Ardipithecus ischial morphology
does not exhibit a trade-off between climbing and walking ca-
pabilities. As noted in its initial description (17), the Ardipithecus
ischium is long, falling within the range observed for apes of
equivalent femur length (Fig. 1C), which results in a peak DMA
similar to apes and substantially greater than in humans (SI
Appendix, Table S5). Nonetheless, DMA envelopes for Ardipithecus
indicate a nearly human-like range of hip extension. We exam-
ined hamstrings DMA envelopes for a wide range of pelvis and
trunk orientations to account for uncertainty in the forward tilt
of the pelvis relative to the spine (Methods; Fig. 3, and SI Ap-
pendix, Fig. S5). With any mechanically feasible bipedal trunk
orientation, powered hip extension would fail between 195° and
205°, depending on the degree of pelvic tilt and lumbar lordosis
or trunk inclination (Fig. 3 and SI Appendix, Table S5). The
Ardipithecus range exceeds the chimpanzees’ by ∼40° and ap-
proaches that of humans (SI Appendix, Table S3).
These results suggest greater hip extension and more eco-
nomical walking in Ardipithecus relative to living and Miocene
apes (although marginally less than that of modern humans),
without a substantial loss of the hip extension moment essential
for climbing. Notably, this dual capability in the Ardipithecus
pelvis derives not from changes in the ischium itself, which re-
mains quite primitive (17), but from changes in ilium morphol-
ogy that reorient the ischium relative to the sacrum and vertebral
column. Derived changes in ilium morphology that unite homi-
nins (17) are generally discussed in terms of lateral stabilization
of the trunk during single-leg stance. Results here highlight the
underappreciated effects of ilium morphology on the mechanics
of hip extension.
Hamstrings DMA envelopes for the Australopithecus specimens
indicate a reduced maximum DMA relative to Ardipithecus,
but a broadly similar range of powered hip extension (Fig. 3 and
SI Appendix, Table S5). The reduction in peak DMA brings the
hamstrings moment arm down into the human range and reflects
the shorter ischia in both Au. afarensis and Au. africanus, which
fall below the range for apes and monkeys (Fig. 1C). Over the
range of mechanically feasible pelvic tilt, maximum hip angles
for Au. afarensis (200–215°; Fig. 3 and SI Appendix, Table S5)
approach the lower range of humans, suggesting nearly human-
like capability for powered hip hyperextension and walking
economy (Fig. 3), consistent with previous reconstructions of
their gait (40–43). Au. africanus maintains greater DMA in
more flexed positions and loses its capacity for powered hip
extension between 180° and 200° (Fig. 3 and SI Appendix, Table
S5), possibly indicating a marginally less hyperextended hip
during walking compared with Au. afarensis.
Enlargement of the gluteus maximus has been linked to the
evolution of endurance running capabilities in Homo (34).
However, the derived ischial morphology evident in Australopithecus
(Fig. 3) suggests this enlargement of the gluteus maximus
and its complementarity with the hamstrings (discussed
earlier) might have begun earlier, possibly under selection
pressure to enable powerful hip extension when the hip was
flexed (e.g., during climbing). This hypothesis is consistent with
previous analyses of pelvic morphology and mechanics in
Australopithecus, suggesting its gluteus maximus size was
intermediate between apes and humans (34, 44). Given the
rightward shift of the Ardipithecus DMA envelope relative to
other nonhuman primates (Fig. 2), it is even possible that
gluteus maximus enlargement and complementarity with the
hamstrings began with earlier hominins.
Discussion
Integrated anatomical and experimental analyses here indicate
that Ardipithecus, the earliest hominin with a preserved pelvis,
avoided the arboreal–terrestrial trade-off in ischial mechanics
evident among living hominoids, and was instead capable of both
powerful hip extension during climbing and economical hip hy-
perextension during walking. It remains unclear whether, and to
what extent, any other of Ardipithecus’ retained adaptations for
arboreality (e.g., elongated forelimb, curved phalanges, and
grasping hallux; refs. 17, 45, and 46) limited its walking
economy or endurance. For example, a mobile, grasping foot
is generally thought to reduce the efficacy of toe-off at the end
of stance phase during walking (10), but experimental work
shows negligible effects of foot anatomy on economy: planti-
grade, digitigrade, and unguligrade species have similar run-
ning costs (47), and mechanical models ignoring tarsal and
metatarsal anatomy successfully predict variation in locomo-
tor economy among hominoids and other taxa (9). Initial de-
scriptions of the Ardipithecus skeleton (17) suggested it had a
relatively short, ape-like hind limb length (48), a feature
known to reduce walking economy (9) and that might improve
climbing. However, more recent analyses suggest a smaller
body mass for Ardipithecus, which would bring its hind limb
length more in line with later hominins (49). An intriguing
possibility suggested by results here is that economical walking

 capabilities evolved in early hominins without any hindrance
from or detriment to arboreal adaptations.
Ischial morphology in Australopithecus suggests reduced power
in hip extension and an increased range of hip hyperextension,
relative to earlier hominins. A shorter ischium might have fur-
ther improved walking economy by reducing hamstrings muscle
strain, as discussed earlier for humans. Hallux adduction in
Australopithecus might have contributed to improved walking
economy, but further testing is needed. Regardless, although
these changes in hind limb morphology suggest selection for
improved walking economy, their effect on arboreal capabilities
is unclear and warrants further testing. For example, despite the
loss of an elongated forelimb, long curved phalanges, and a
grasping foot, humans are just as energetically efficient when
climbing as arboreal primates (50). Rather than a functional
trade-off between walking and climbing capability, hind limb
changes in Australopithecus could reflect reduced time spent
arboreally and weakened selection for traits to maintain safety in
the canopy (13). Although locomotor capabilities are inherently
multivariate, identifying specific performance variables (e.g.,
safety, economy, speed) to test empirically will improve our re-
constructions of hominin locomotor evolution.
Reconstructions of locomotor capabilities and ecology in ex-
tinct taxa have traditionally used a “fossil-first” approach, start-
ing with a detailed description of the preserved morphology and
deducing its function from first principles (e.g., ref. 4) or by
assigning it to an extant functional group. Although useful, these
approaches often prove inconclusive or misleading when traits,
or trait combinations, fall outside those of modern taxa, which is
a common occurrence in fossil analyses. Results here demon-
strate the utility of a complementary “function-first” approach,
focusing on empirically validated determinants of locomotor
performance (e.g., hip hyperextension) and integrating detailed
anatomical measures with experimental data to resolve loco-
motor capabilities in fossil taxa. Given the breadth of morpho-
logical solutions and locomotor capabilities among fossil apes
and hominins, not to mention the diversity of extinct taxa
throughout the paleontological record, both fossil-first and
function-first approaches are needed to reconstruct the ecol-
ogy of species past and the origins of modern groups.
Methods
Morphological Sample. The fossil sample consists of the pelvis model gener-
ated from ARA-VP 6/500 (A. ramidus) (17), as well as the American Museum
of Natural History reconstructions of the pelvis for A.L. 288–1 (Au. afarensis),
STS 14 (Au. africanus), and a cast of KNM-MW 13124 (E. nyanzae). All apes
(n = 69), cercopithecids (n = 32), and platyrrhines (n = 24) are wild shot adult
specimens from the American Museum of Natural History and Smithsonian
Museum (SI Appendix, Table S1). The human sample consists of 18 adults
from the American Museum of Natural History Medical Collection, including
both African-American and Caucasian individuals (SI Appendix, Table S1).
Landmarks and measurements. Using a Microscribe, a set of 23 landmarks (51) (SI
Appendix, Fig. S1 and Table S6) was collected on one os coxae of each
specimen. Ischial length was defined as the distance between the deepest
point of the acetabulum and the midpoint of the most dorsal/superior point
and the most dorsal/inferior point of the ischial tuberosity. Femur length
was measured as the distance from the most superior point on the femoral
head to the most inferior point on the medial condyle. Sacral breadth was
measured as the distance between the most lateral aspects of the right and
left alae. For the fossil sample, landmarks were collected from model re-
constructions, and estimated femur lengths and sacral breadths were
obtained from the literature (15, 38, 52) (SI Appendix, Table S2). We esti-
mate the sacral breath for ARA-VP 6/500 at 105 mm, based on the report
that its estimated interacetabular distance is 115% wider than in A.L. 288–1
(17). In addition, we analyzed ranges of ±10% on estimated femur lengths
and sacral breadths to account for the possible error in these estimates.
Orientation. Each landmark set underwent a series of translations and rota-
tions to place all specimens in anatomical orientation (SI Appendix, Fig. S6).
For humans, the degree of pelvic tilt in the sagittal plane was determined
from published dissection data (53), which indicate an angle of 15° relative
to horizontal for the segment connecting the posterior superior iliac spine
and anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS) reflected in the sagittal plane (SI
Appendix, Fig. S4). There are no comparable nonhuman primate dissection
data published. Therefore, we measured the angle between the trunk and
the line connecting the superior pubic symphysis and the ASIS (SI Appendix,
Fig. S7) on digital photos of mounted skeletons in lateral view in 12 non-
human primates (five apes, three cercopithecoids, and four platyrrhines;
mean = 43.2°, SD = 5.2°, SI Appendix, Fig. S7 and Table S7). We used a 40°
quadrupedal orientation for nonhuman primates with an included ±10° in
sensitivity analyses to account for variation. This approach is consistent with
observed trunk orientations in the sagittal plane for bipedal humans and
chimpanzees (54).
The human orientation, based on ASIS position, would be inappropriate
for early hominins human evolution because the ASIS has moved anteriorly in
Homo relative to earlier hominins. Instead, for Ardipithecus, Au. afarensis,
and Au. africanus, bipedal pelvic orientation was calculated over the full-
range positions where the iliac crest is positioned above the acetabulum,
under the assumption that some portion of the abductor muscle fibers must
run vertically over the acetabulum to oppose gravity in single-leg stance (Fig.
3). At one extreme of this range, the posterior-most aspect of the posterior
iliac crest lies directly above the posterior-most aspect of the acetabulum. At
the other extreme of the range, the ASIS lies directly above the anterior-
most aspect of the acetabulum (Fig. 3 and SI Appendix, Fig. S3). At the
midpoint of this range, the midpoint between the ASIS and posterior-most
aspect of the posterior iliac crest lies directly above the center of the ace-
tabulum. This functional range of pelvic orientation is supported by the
human osteological data set: mean displacement from midpoint position
was 1.2° ± 6.8° (range, −9.3° to +13.3°) for human specimens in our sample,
and none fell outside the maximum range of pelvic tilt applied to
fossil hominins.
DMA. Hip angle is defined as the angle between the femur and trunk axis in
the sagittal plane (φ in Fig. 1). Moment arm and DMA were calculated across
a range of angles (0–250° at 5° intervals) for each specimen. The hamstring
moment arm (r) is the perpendicular distance between the hip center of
rotation (approximated as the deepest point of the acetabulum) and the line
of action (i.e., the force vector) for the hamstring muscles (the line con-
necting the origin and insertion points of the hamstrings) in the sagittal
plane. The angle between the femur and hamstrings (α) was calculated from
the coordinates of the acetabulum, distal femur, and ischial attachment of
the hamstrings, using the law of cosines (SI Appendix, Fig. S3). The moment
arm r is then given by r = sin(α) B, where B is femur length. DMA is the ratio
of the moment arm r/B, and it defines the tangential force exerted at the
knee for each newton of hamstring force.
DMA sensitivity analyses. We performed sensitivity analyses to assess how
robust results are to input parameter variation (SI Appendix, SI Text, Figs.
S2 and S3, and Table S4). DMA values will be affected by sacral breadth,
femur length, pelvic pitch, the location of the origin of the hamstrings on
the ischium, and the location of hamstrings insertion on the tibia/fibula and
knee flexion. To evaluate the effects of variation or uncertainty in sacral
breadth and femur length, we varied these parameters by ±10% and ex-
amined changes in DMA envelopes (SI Appendix, SI Text 1). Next we varied
pelvic pitch by ±10° and examined the effects on DMA (SI Appendix, Table
S4). Finally, we measured the combined effect of varying pelvic pitch by ±10°
and varying the point of origin of the hamstrings to the most superior and
to the most inferior points of the ischial tuberosity face (SI Appendix, Fig.
S1). The effect of hamstrings attachment on the tibia/fibula and knee flexion
is modeled in SI Appendix, Fig. S4. In all sensitivity analyses, the pattern of
DMA differences among humans, fossil hominins, and nonhuman apes was
robust to variation and uncertainty in model parameters.
Kinematics. Hip angles during quadrupedal level locomotion were measured
for captive Pongo spp., Pan paniscus, Pan troglodytes, Gorilla gorilla, and
Macaca fuscata (Fig. 2B and SI Appendix, Table S3). High-speed videos
(300 frames/s, taken with Casio Exilim FX 1) of apes moving perpendicular to
the camera line of sight were analyzed in the program Kinovea (version 0.8.14;
www.kinovea.org/). Videos were recorded from public viewing platforms at
10 Association of Zoos and Aquariums-accredited US zoos (Zoo Atlanta,
Columbus Zoo, Dallas Zoo, Franklin Park Zoo, Indianapolis Zoo, Jacksonville
Zoo, Lincoln Park Zoo, Milwaukee County Zoo, North Carolina Zoo, and Okla-
homa City Zoo). Hunter College and all participating zoos provided Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee approval before data collection. The hip angle
is defined, following previous studies (8, 27), as the angle between the
shoulder, hip, and knee centers of rotation. To obtain the range of hip flexion
and extension, hip angles were measured at touch down (first frame of con-
tact with substrate) and toe-off (last frame of contact with the substrate).

 A subset of five videos were measured twice at a 1-wk interval to evaluate
interobserver error (mean error, 1.45°). A paired t test showed that the
two data sets where not significantly different from each other (P = 0.39).
Hip angles for apes climbing and human walking were taken from the
literature (7, 19).
Kinetics. Human and chimpanzee moment data were collected within a lo-
comotor energetics study (8). Bonobo kinetic data were collected as part of a
bonobo locomotor study (kinematics reported in refs. 27 and 55). Moments
were rendered dimensionless by dividing them by body weight and lower
leg length. Hip angles were extracted from high-speed video using the same
approach as for kinematic trials. All animal research was conducted with
prior institutional approval (8, 27, 55). Bonobo data have not been previously
published.
