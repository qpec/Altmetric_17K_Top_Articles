IMPORTANCE Obesity is a risk factor for deep vein thrombosis of the leg and pulmonary
embolism. To date, however, whether obesity is associated with adult cerebral venous
thrombosis (CVT) has not been assessed.
OBJECTIVE To assess whether obesity is a risk factor for CVT.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A case-control study was performed in consecutive
adult patients with CVT admitted from July 1, 2006 (Amsterdam), and October 1, 2009
(Berne), through December 31, 2014, to the Academic Medical Center in Amsterdam, the
Netherlands, or Inselspital University Hospital in Berne, Switzerland. The control group was
composed of individuals from the control population of the Multiple Environmental and
Genetic Assessment of Risk Factors for Venous Thrombosis study, which was a large Dutch
case-control study performed from March 1, 1999, to September 31, 2004, and in which risk
factors for deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism were assessed. Data analysis was
performed from January 2 to July 12, 2015.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Obesity was determined by body mass index (BMI). A BMI
of 30 or greater was considered to indicate obesity, and a BMI of 25 to 29.99 was considered
to indicate overweight. A multiple imputation procedure was used for missing data. We
adjusted for sex, age, history of cancer, ethnicity, smoking status, and oral contraceptive use.
Individuals with normal weight (BMI <25) were the reference category.
RESULTS The study included 186 cases and 6134 controls. Cases were younger (median age,
40 vs 48 years), more often female (133 [71.5%] vs 3220 [52.5%]), more often used oral
contraceptives (97 [72.9%] vs 758 [23.5%] of women), and more frequently had a history of
cancer (17 [9.1%] vs 235 [3.8%]) compared with controls. Obesity (BMI �30) was associated
with an increased risk of CVT (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 2.63; 95% CI, 1.53-4.54).
Stratification by sex revealed a strong association between CVT and obesity in women
(adjusted OR, 3.50; 95% CI, 2.00-6.14) but not in men (adjusted OR, 1.16; 95% CI, 0.25-5.30).
Further stratification revealed that, in women who used oral contraceptives, overweight and
obesity were associated with an increased risk of CVT in a dose-dependent manner (BMI
25.0-29.9: adjusted OR, 11.87; 95% CI, 5.94-23.74; BMI �30: adjusted OR, 29.26; 95% CI,
13.47-63.60). No association was found in women who did not use oral contraceptives.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Obesity is a strong risk factor for CVT in women who use oral
contraceptives.

V
arious studies1-6 have identified obesity as a risk fac-
tor for deep vein thrombosis of the leg and pulmonary
embolism, collectively called venous thromboembo-
lism (VTE). A body mass index (BMI) (calculated as weight in
kilograms divided by height in meters squared) of 30 or more
increases the risk of VTE approximately 2-fold compared with
a normal BMI (<25), and this risk increases more with higher
BMIs. Individuals with a BMI greater than 40 have an approxi-
mately 3 times higher risk.
Cerebralvenousthrombosis(CVT)isararethromboticcon-
dition that mainly affects young adults and children.7 Risk fac-
tors for CVT partly overlap with those for VTE and include
thrombophilia,cancer,andoralcontraceptiveuse.8,9Otherrisk
factors, such as local infections and head trauma, are specific
for CVT.10 Some diseases, such as acute lymphoblastic leuke-
mia, are associated with CVT and VTE, but the association is
stronger for CVT.11
Toourknowledge,whetherobesityisassociatedwithadult
CVT has not been assessed. One study12 found that obesity is
more common in children with CVT (55%) compared with con-
trols (32%), but the sample size was small (22 cases). In addi-
tion, this study12 used historical controls and did not adjust
for confounding variables. Moreover, because the clinical pre-
sentation and risk factors of CVT are different for children and
adults,13 this result cannot be generalized to adult patients. In
the current study, we examined whether obesity is a risk fac-
tor for adult CVT.
Methods
Study Design and Patient Selection
We performed an unmatched case-control study. The con-
trols were recruited from March 1, 1999, through September
31, 2004, and the cases were recruited from July 1, 2006 (Am-
sterdam), and October 1, 2009 (Berne), through December 31,
2014. Data analysis was performed from January 2 to July 12,
2015.
Cases were patients with CVT included in 2 prospective co-
horts from the Academic Medical Center in Amsterdam, the
Netherlands,andInselspitalUniversityHospitalinBerne,Swit-
zerland. In these hospitals, data on consecutive adult pa-
tients with CVT have been recorded since July 2006 (Amster-
dam) and October 2009 (Berne). We included patients who
were admitted until December 2014. The diagnosis of CVT was
confirmed with computed tomography venography, mag-
netic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance venogra-
phy, angiography, or autopsy in all patients in accordance with
international guidelines.14
Controls were healthy individuals who participated in the
DutchMultipleEnvironmentalandGeneticAssessmentofRisk
Factors for Venous Thrombosis (MEGA) study.15 The MEGA
studyisacase-controlstudyperformedintheNetherlandsthat
included 4956 consecutive patients aged 18 to 70 years with a
first deep vein thrombosis of the leg or pulmonary embolism
from March 1, 1999, through September 31, 2004. Details of
this study have been reported.15 Partners of patients and in-
dividuals identified by random digit dialing were asked to par-
ticipate as controls. In total, 6297 controls (3297 partners and
3000 identified by random digit dialing) were included. These
participants were between the ages of 18 and 70 years and had
no history of venous thrombosis. We excluded women (cases
and controls) who were pregnant or had given birth less than
12 weeks earlier.
The Medical Ethics Committee Academic Medical Cen-
ter, Committee Medical Ethics Leiden University Medical Cen-
tre, and Cantonal Ethics Commission Bern approved the study.
Written informed consent was obtained from all participants
included in the MEGA study and the Berne cohort. For the pa-
tients with CVT included in the Amsterdam cohort, written in-
formedconsentwasnotrequiredunderDutchlawbecauseonly
observational data were collected.
Data Collection and Definition of Obesity
Baseline characteristics, risk factors for thrombosis, imaging
findings, and clinical outcome were recorded using a stan-
dardized case report form for cases. Each control completed
a detailed questionnaire on acquired risk factors for throm-
bosis, which included self-reported current height and weight.
In accordance with the definitions of the World Health Orga-
nization, BMI was categorized as follows: normal weight, BMI
less than 25; overweight, BMI of 25 to 29.99; and obesity, BMI
of 30 or greater.
Statistical Analysis
A multiple imputation procedure was used for missing data on
height, weight, oral contraceptive use, smoking status, his-
tory of cancer, and ethnicity.16 In total, 5 data sets were im-
puted, and results were pooled according to Rubin’
s rules. We
applied multivariate logistic regression analysis to study the
association between obesity and CVT. Individuals with a nor-
mal BMI (<25) were the reference category. In a separate analy-
sis, we included BMI as a continuous variable in the model. Un-
adjusted and adjusted odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs were
calculated. We adjusted for the following prespecified vari-
ables:sex,age(asacontinuousvariable),historyofcancer,eth-
nicity, smoking status, and oral contraceptive use. On the ba-
sis of a previous report,4 we performed predefined subgroup
analyses in which we studied the influence of sex and oral con-
traceptive use on the association between obesity and CVT.
P < .05 was considered statistically significant. All data were
analyzed with SPSS statistical software, version 20 (SPSS Inc).
Key Points
Question: Is obesity a risk factor for cerebral venous thrombosis?
Findings: In this case-control study that included 186 cases and
6134 controls, obesity was associated with a statistically significant
3-fold increased risk of cerebral venous thrombosis. Stratification
by sex revealed that in women who used oral contraceptives, the
risk was increased 30-fold. In contrast, we found no association in
men or women who did not use oral contraceptives.
Meaning: Obesity is a strong risk factor for cerebral venous
thrombosis in women who use oral contraceptives.

Results
There were 192 cases and 6297 controls within the specified
period. We excluded 6 cases and 163 controls because of preg-
nancy or recent delivery; therefore, the study population con-
sisted of 186 cases and 6134 controls. The numbers of pa-
tients for whom data were missing were as follows: height, 547
(64 cases and 483 controls); weight, 539 (57 cases and 482 con-
trols); oral contraceptive use, 32 (6 cases and 26 controls); his-
tory of cancer, 20 (1 case and 19 controls); smoking status, 487
(57 cases and 430 controls); and ethnicity, 423 (38 cases and
385 controls). In total, BMI could not be calculated without im-
putation in 69 cases because height or weight was not avail-
able. Eleven of these cases (15.9%) had obesity listed in their
medical history.
Cases were younger (median age, 40 vs 48 years), more of-
ten female (133 [71.5%] vs 3220 [52.5%]), more often used oral
contraceptives (97 [72.9%] vs 758 [23.5%] women), and more
frequentlyhadahistoryofcancer(17[9.1%]vs235[3.8%])com-
pared with controls (Table 1). The most common clinical mani-
festations of patients with CVT are provided in Table 2.
Mean BMI was higher in cases than controls (26.7 vs 25.6,
P = .01). After adjustment for confounding variables, the risk
of CVT was increased in patients with obesity (BMI ≥30; ad-
justedOR,2.63;95%CI,1.53-4.54)comparedwithpatientswith
a normal BMI (Table 3). Overweight (BMI 25.0-29.99) was not
associated with CVT (adjusted OR, 1.37; 95% CI, 0.80-2.36).
When included as a continuous variable, BMI was also asso-
ciated with an increased risk of CVT (adjusted OR per 1-unit
increase in BMI, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.05-1.13; P < .001).
Stratification by sex revealed no statistically significant as-
sociation between obesity and the risk of CVT in men (ad-
justed OR, 1.16; 95% CI, 0.25-5.30; Table 4). In women, over-
weight and obesity were associated with CVT (BMI 25-29.9:
adjustedOR,1.71;95%CI,1.01-2.91;BMI≥30:adjustedOR,3.50;
95% CI, 2.00-6.14).
We also stratified for oral contraceptive use (Table 5).
Among women who did not use oral contraceptives, we found
no association between obesity and CVT (BMI ≥30: adjusted
OR, 1.29; 95% CI, 0.46-3.66). In contrast, in women who used
oral contraceptives, obesity was strongly associated with the
risk of CVT. Compared with women with a normal weight who
did not use oral contraceptives, obese women taking oral con-
traceptives had a 29-fold increased risk of CVT (adjusted OR,
29.26; 95% CI, 13.47-63.60). The risk of CVT was also in-
creased in overweight women who used oral contraceptives
(BMI 25-29.99: adjusted OR, 11.87; 95% CI, 5.94-23.74).
Discussion
Our study indicates that obesity (BMI ≥30) is associated with
an increased risk of CVT. This association appears to be fully
attributable to a strongly increased risk in women who use oral
contraceptives. Among these women, obesity was associated
with an almost 30-fold increased risk of CVT compared with
women of normal weight who did not use oral contracep-
tives. In men and women who do not use oral contraceptives,
we found no association between CVT and obesity.
In VTE, the association with obesity is also stronger in
women than men. In a large cohort study,5 a BMI in the high-
est quartile increased the risk of VTE 2.8-fold for women and
1.7-fold for men. Another study3 confirmed similar effect sizes.
Only a few studies4,17,18 have examined the interaction be-
tween oral contraceptive use and obesity on the risk of VTE.
Pomp et al4 found an OR of 24 among women with a BMI of
30orgreaterwhousedoralcontraceptivescomparedwithnon-
users of oral contraceptives who were of normal weight. In an-
other study,17 the risk of VTE in oral contraceptive users with
a BMI of 30 or greater was increased approximately 10-fold. A
possible interaction between oral contraceptives and obesity
has also been observed in ischemic stroke. In a case-control
study by Kemmeren et al,18 the risk of ischemic stroke in
women who used oral contraceptives was approximately
doubled in those with obesity.
Among oral contraceptive users, the risk of CVT was
higher in those with obesity (BMI ≥30) than in women who
were overweight (BMI 25-29.99). This dose-response effect,
in combination with the magnitude of the effect size and the
evidence that obesity is also associated with VTE,2,4,19 favors
a causal association among obesity, oral contraceptive use,
and CVT.20 One mechanism by which obesity could increase
the risk of thrombosis are changes in coagulation factor lev-
els. Compared with women with a normal weight, obese

women have higher plasma concentrations of prothrombotic
factors, such as plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 and
von Willebrand factor.21 Obesity is also associated with
increased activated protein C resistance and higher concen-
trations of factor VIII, which are risk factors for thrombosis.22

It is important to determine whether the control group we
used is representative of the healthy population. In our study,
the prevalence of a BMI of 30 or greater was 12.6% and 13.8%
among male and female controls, respectively. These percent-
ages are similar to the findings of a study24 among healthy
adults from the Netherlands that was performed in the same
period as the MEGA study. The prevalence of a BMI above 25
among men and women is also comparable to the results of
that study.
Of interest, obesity is also a risk factor for idiopathic in-
tracranial hypertension (IIH). Patients with IIH most often
presentwithheadache,papilledema,anddecreasedvisualacu-
ity. Identical symptoms occur in intracranial hypertension ow-
ing to impaired venous return in patients with chronic CVT.25
Before the introduction of computed tomography and
magnetic resonance venography, it was not uncommon for
patients with CVT to be misdiagnosed as having IIH.26,27 Like
CVT, IIH is far more common in women than in men, and the

association between IIH and obesity is also stronger in women
than men.28-30 Given these resemblances, it is intriguing to
speculate on a possible common pathogenesis by which obe-
sity increases the risk of both conditions in women. It has been
hypothesized that IIH is caused by decreased outflow from the
cerebralvenoussystem,possiblyowingtostenosisofthetrans-
verse sinuses or insufficiency of the valves in the jugular
veins.31,32Studies31,33havesuggestedthatobesityenhancesthis
mechanism by transmittance of increased intra-abdominal
pressure to the cerebral venous system. On the other hand,
there are also data indicating that the sinus stenosis seen in
IIH is secondary to the increased intracranial pressure and is
reversible after removal of cerebrospinal fluid.34 The effect of
stenting of the cerebral sinuses has been examined in pa-
tients with IIH but only in small and uncontrolled series, and
the data are inconclusive.35,36 Prospective studies37,38 evalu-
ating the efficacy of cerebral venous sinus stenting in IIH are
currently ongoing.
Our study has several limitations. First, we could include
only a relatively small number of patients with CVT, espe-
cially men and women without oral contraceptive use. We can-
not exclude that the absent association between obesity and
CVT in these groups is the result of this limited sample size.
Second, we were unable to examine whether genetic throm-
bophilia influences the association between obesity and CVT
because screening for thrombophilia was not performed in
most cases. Thrombophilia should be the focus of a future
study given that there is a synergistic effect between oral con-
traceptives and thrombophilia on the risk of CVT9,39 and be-
tween obesity and thrombophilia on the risk of VTE.4 Third,
data on the key variables of height and weight were missing
in a substantial proportion of cases because these measure-
ments were not recorded in all patients. This lack of data on
height and weight could have underpowered the study and bi-
ased the results if the reason the data were missing was not
random. To minimize this potential bias, we used a multiple
imputationprocedure.16,40Thefactthat15.9%ofcasesinwhich
no BMI could be calculated had obesity listed in their medical
history also suggests that obesity was not infrequent among
cases with missing BMI. Fourth, instead of measuring height
and weight, we used self-reported data to calculate BMI, which
could be less accurate, although a previous study6 found an
excellentcorrelationbetweenself-reportedandmeasuredBMI.
Moreover, because measurements were self-reported for cases
and controls, any inaccuracy would be expected to affect both
groups, which would decrease the risk of bias. Fifth, there was
a time difference in recruitment between cases and controls.
The controls were recruited from March 1, 1999, through Sep-
tember 31, 2004, whereas the cases were recruited from July
1, 2006 (Amsterdam), and October 1, 2009 (Berne), through
December 31, 2014. A change in prevalence of obesity in that
period could theoretically have biased the results. However,
the time difference seems to be too small to explain the re-
sults and would also not explain why we only observed an as-
sociation in women who used oral contraceptives. Finally, we
cannot exclude the possibility that residual confounding in-
fluenced the results. Some variables, such as obstructive sleep
apnea syndrome, were not available for controls. Obstructive
sleep apnea syndrome is a risk factor for obesity and VTE, al-
though, to our knowledge, an association with CVT has never
been reported.41,42
TheincreasedriskofVTEandCVTassociatedwithoralcon-
traceptives in the presence of obesity might make physicians
reluctanttoprescribeoralcontraceptivestoobesewomen.How-
ever, although the relative risks are increased substantially, the
absolute risks of CVT are still small.43 Moreover, withholding
oralcontraceptivesmayleadtoanincreaseinunintendedpreg-
nancies and thus the number of pregnancy-related thrombo-
sis cases.44 Nevertheless, obese women should be informed
about the increased risk of thrombosis if they use oral contra-
ceptives, especially if other risk factors are present. Alterna-
tive methods of contraception that are not associated with
thrombosis, such as an intrauterine device, might be offered to
these women.
Conclusions
To our knowledge, this is the first case-control study that ex-
amined the association between obesity and CVT. Our results
suggest that obesity is associated with a substantially in-
creasedriskofCVTinwomenwhouseoralcontraceptives.This
increased risk should be taken into consideration when pre-
scribing oral contraceptives to obese women.
