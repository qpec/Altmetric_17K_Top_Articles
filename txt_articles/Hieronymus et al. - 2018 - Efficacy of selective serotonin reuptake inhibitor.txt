Efficacy of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in the
absence of side effects: a mega-analysis of citalopram and
paroxetine in adult depression
F Hieronymus1, A Lisinski1, S Nilsson2 and E Eriksson1
It has been suggested that the superiority of antidepressants over placebo in controlled trials is merely a consequence of side
effects enhancing the expectation of improvement by making the patient realize that he/she is not on placebo. We explored this
hypothesis in a patient-level post hoc-analysis including all industry-sponsored, Food and Drug Administration-registered placebo-
controlled trials of citalopram or paroxetine in adult major depression that used the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) and
included a week 6 symptom assessment (n = 15). The primary analyses, which compared completers on active treatment without
early adverse events to completers on placebo (with or without adverse events) with respect to reduction in the HDRS depressed
mood item showed larger symptom reduction in patients given active treatment, the effect sizes being 0.48 for citalopram and 0.33
for paroxetine. In actively treated subjects reporting early adverse events, who also outperformed those given placebo, the severity
of the adverse events did not predict response. Several sensitivity analyses, for example, including (i) those using change of the sum
of all HDRS-17 items as effect parameter, (ii) those excluding all subjects with adverse events (that is, also those on placebo) and (iii)
those based on the intention-to-treat population, were all in line with the primary analyses. The finding that both paroxetine and
citalopram are clearly superior to placebo also when not producing adverse events, as well as the lack of association between
adverse event severity and response, argue against the theory that antidepressants outperform placebo solely or largely because of
their side effects.

INTRODUCTION
The possible existence of a specific pharmacological antidepres-
sant effect has become one of the major controversies in current
medicine. Questioning the traditional view that drugs named
antidepressants act by influencing certain brain neurotransmitters,
it has hence been suggested that their superiority over placebo in
controlled trials is merely a psychological consequence of the side
effects of the drugs enhancing the expectation of improvement
by making the patient realize that he/she is not on placebo.1–4 If
this hypothesis, which has gained widespread attention in lay
media,5–8 is correct, the extensive use of these drugs must be
reconsidered. But should it be false, it is important to have this
clarified, so that doctors are not groundlessly discouraged from
prescribing effective medication.
There have been previous attempts to shed light on the
possible association between the presence of antidepressant-
induced side effects and response by means of trial-level
meta-analyses but with discordant and inconclusive results.9,10
However, whereas these studies have been based on the
assumption that there may be marked inter-trial differences with
respect to the propensity of the participants to experience
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)-induced side effects
that translate into corresponding differences in response rate, it
may be argued that the difference in propensity to side effects of
possible
relevance
in
this
context
should
reside
between
individuals rather than between trial populations. For this reason,
and considering that patient-level mega-analyses and meta-
analyses of trial-level data may differ significantly in outcome,11
a more informative approach to address this problem may be to
compare the response in patients reporting and not reporting
adverse events, respectively. To this end, we have conducted what
we believe are the first patient-level mega-analyses investigating
(i) whether the presence of adverse events is necessary for SSRIs to
outperform placebo and (ii) whether the presence of adverse
events, or adverse event severity, is associated with response in
patients treated with SSRIs
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data acquisition and verification
We requested patient-level data regarding item-wise symptom ratings and
timing of adverse events for all industry-sponsored, Food and Drug
Administration-registered, placebo-controlled trials regarding adult major
depression that have been conducted for fluoxetine (Eli Lilly, Indianapolis,
IN, USA), sertraline (Pfizer, New York, NY, USA), paroxetine (GlaxoSmithKline
(GSK), Brentford, UK) and citalopram (Lundbeck, Valby, Denmark). Lilly
could not provide us with the requested information regarding fluoxetine,
as these data are not available in electronic format, and Pfizer could not
provide us with data regarding the timing of adverse events for the
sertraline trials. GSK and Lundbeck could however provide us with the
requested information regarding paroxetine and citalopram, respectively.
To be eligible for inclusion, the trial should have used the Hamilton

 Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) for symptom rating and include an
assessment at week 6. Examination of the Food and Drug Administration
Approval Packages for the two drugs12–14 confirmed that we had access to
all pertinent studies regarding these two drugs with the exception of two
small trials, which, according to the Food and Drug Administration
approval
packages,
were
prematurely
terminated:
GSK/07,12
which
randomized 13 patients on paroxetine (8 completers) and 12 patients on
placebo (7 completers), and LB/87A,13 which randomized 17 patients on
citalopram
(5
completers)
and
17
patients
on
placebo
(4 completers). In addition to the Food and Drug Administration-
registered trials, GSK also provided data from four post-registration trials
regarding paroxetine.
Aims
The aims of this study were threefold. One was to assess to what extent
presence of adverse events constitutes an indispensable prerequisite for
antidepressants to outperform placebo, a second to assess whether the
presence of adverse events (yes/no) is associated with response in
SSRI-treated subjects and a third to assess whether severity of adverse
events is associated with response in SSRI-treated subjects.
Comparisons
The decision on which analyses should be regarded as primary when
assessing the difference between active drug and placebo in subjects with
or without adverse events was based on a number of methodological
considerations. First, adverse events may prompt some patients to
discontinue treatment before having had a chance to improve; including
dropouts in the analysis might hence mask a possible positive association
between side effects and response. To avoid this potential source of bias,
which might lead to an erroneous falsification of the placebo-breaking-the-
blind hypothesis, only patients completing the trial were included in the
primary analyses. Second, as a number of potential side effects of SSRIs (for
example, weight change, insomnia, gastrointestinal symptoms and sexual
dysfunction) are listed as possible symptoms of depression in the HDRS-
17,15 using the total sum of the ratings of the different items in this scale
(HDRS-17-sum) as effect parameter, which has been the conventional way
of establishing efficacy in antidepressant trials,16 might also mask a
possible association between adverse events and response. For this reason,
only one item from the HDRS-17, depressed mood, which was recently
shown to be a more sensitive measure for detecting differences between
active drug and placebo,17,18 was used as primary measure of efficacy.
Third, in clinical trials one usually records any novel complaint appearing
during treatment as an adverse event regardless of whether it is likely to
be a side effect of the given treatment or not.19 As most side effects of
SSRIs appear shortly after the initiation of treatment, and as the side-effect-
breaking-the-blind hypothesis implies that side effects should precede or
appear simultaneously as the symptom reduction, we reasoned that
restricting the primary analyses to adverse events appearing during the
first 2 weeks of treatment would optimize the likelihood of establishing an
association between side effects and response. Fourth, as it could be
argued that the presence of one mild side effect would be sufficient to
make the patient realize that he/she has not been given placebo, in the
primary analyses adverse events were handled as a dichotomous yes/no
variable rather than rated with respect to severity.
Although the primary analyses hence were based on the completer
population, used the single item depressed mood (rated 0–4) from the
HDRS-17 as outcome parameter and only considered the presence of
adverse events (yes/no) during the first 2 weeks of double-blind treatment,
a number of sensitivity analyses were undertaken to assess the results of
alternative approaches. When splitting the active treatment groups, we
thus (i) considered not only adverse events during week 1–2 but also those
reported during the run-in period, where all subjects received placebo
single-blindly; (ii) considered only adverse events during week 1 (rather
than during weeks 1–2); (iii) considered all adverse events reported at any
time during weeks 1–6; and (iv) considered only those adverse events
during weeks 1–2 that were not present also before randomization. For the
paroxetine trials, the effect of taking only those adverse events that the
investigator regarded as possibly and/or probably related to treatment into
account when splitting the active treatment groups was also assessed; for
the citalopram trials, the corresponding analyses could not be undertaken,
as this information was not available. The primary analyses were also
repeated using HDRS-17-sum rather than depressed mood as effect
parameter and analyzing the intention-to-treat rather than the completer
population, respectively. Finally, although we judge the comparison of
SSRI-treated patients not reporting adverse events with all placebo-treated
patients to be the most relevant one, we also compared SSRI-treated
subjects reporting no early adverse event with placebo-treated patients
also reporting no early adverse event and SSRI-treated subjects reporting
at least one early adverse event with placebo-treated patients also
reporting at least one early adverse event.
Statistics
Citalopram and paroxetine trials were analyzed separately. Analysis of
covariance with baseline values on the outcome measure included as a
covariate and trial as a fixed factor was used in all models. When
investigating whether presence of adverse events is necessary for active
drug to outperform placebo, a three category variable classifying patients
as either placebo-treated, SSRI-treated without early (weeks 1–2) adverse
events, or SSRI-treated with early adverse events was included as a fixed
factor. Effect sizes (ESs) were calculated by dividing the least squares mean
differences between groups by the root mean squared error of the model.
The various sensitivity analyses based on alternate outcome measures
and adverse event timings (see above) all used the same model
specification as the primary analyses. In the intention-to-treat analyses,
the last observation carried forward procedure was used to obtain ratings
for all patients with at least one post-baseline visit. When assessing the
impact of investigator-judged relatedness of adverse events to treatment,
the group of paroxetine-treated patients was divided based on whether or
not the patients experienced (i) at least one early adverse event deemed as
probably treatment-related or (ii) at least one early adverse event deemed
as probably or possibly treatment-related. For the comparison of SSRI- and
placebo-treated patients with early adverse events, and of SSRI- and
placebo-treated patients without early adverse events, respectively, the
populations were stratified according to whether or not they had reported
at least one adverse event during weeks 1–2. For this analysis, the three-
category variable was substituted with a binary treatment factor (SSRI or
placebo); otherwise the model was identical.
For the assessment of the possible association between adverse event
severity and reduction in depressed mood, SSRI-treated subjects reporting
adverse events during weeks 1–2 were divided into three groups: those for
which the most severe adverse event was rated as mild, moderate and
severe, respectively. This was coded into a variable with three categories
and included as a fixed factor. Placebo-treated patients as well as
SSRI-treated patients reporting no early adverse events were excluded
from this analysis.
All analyses of citalopram data were carried out locally using SAS version
9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). For the paroxetine trials, remote desktop
access to the Clinical Trial Data Transparency environment was provided
by the Clinical Study Data Request website through SAS Solutions
OnDemand, again using SAS version 9.4.
Ethics
The Regional Ethical Review Board reviewed the study protocol and issued
an advisory opinion stating no objection.
RESULTS
Trials and patients
Baseline characteristics of the included trials are summarized in
Table 1. An endpoint observation was available for 2759 patients
(939 on placebo) from the paroxetine trials and for 585 patients
(132 on placebo) from the citalopram trials.
Comparisons of active drug and placebo in patients with or
without adverse events
Paroxetine-treated patients both with and without early adverse
events outperformed those given placebo with respect to
reduction
in
depressed
mood
(Figure
1).
Similarly,
for
citalopram-treated patients both those reporting and those not
reporting early adverse events fared better than the placebo
group with regard to depressed mood (Figure 2). A number of
sensitivity analyses exploring alternative strategies for defining
presence of adverse events, that is, (i) considering also adverse
SSRI efficacy in the absence of adverse events

 events during the placebo run-in phase, (ii) only considering
adverse events appearing during week 1, (iii) considering all
adverse events reported during week 1–6, (iv) only considering
those adverse events that were not present prior to study start, or
(v) only considering adverse events that were regarded as possibly
or
probably
related
to
treatment
by
the
investigator,
all
corroborated the results of the primary analyses (Supplementary
Figures 1–10). Likewise, sensitivity analyses using the HDRS-17-
sum as outcome parameter were in line with those of the primary
analyses
(Supplementary
Figures
11
and
12),
one notable
exception being that citalopram-treated patients with adverse
events did not significantly outperform the placebo group with
respect to HDRS-17-sum reduction; in contrast, citalopram-treated
patients without adverse events did (Supplementary Figure 12).
Analyses based on the intention-to-treat population were in line
with those of the primary analyses (Supplementary Figures 13 and
14). Similarly, analyses stratifying not only the SSRI group but also
the placebo group according to the presence of early adverse
events revealed significant superiority of active treatment both for
patients with early adverse events (citalopram ES 0.28, 0.05–0.51,
P = 0.02; paroxetine ES 0.47, 0.37–0.57, Po0.001) and for patients
without early adverse events (citalopram ES 0.52, 0.14–0.90;
P = 0.008; paroxetine ES 0.33, 0.19–0.48; Po.001).
Assessment of the influence of adverse events on the effect of
active drug
According to the primary analysis as well as various sensitivity
analyses, paroxetine-treated subjects reporting early adverse
events displayed a small but significant superiority with respect
to reduction in depressed mood as compared with those not
reporting early adverse events; no corresponding association
between adverse events and response was observed in the
citalopram trials (Figures 1 and 2, and Supplementary Figures 1–10
and 13 and 14). For neither the paroxetine nor the citalopram trials
were there any significant differences between patients reporting
or not reporting early adverse events with respect to reduction in
HDRS-17-sum (Supplementary Figures 11 and 12).
Influence of adverse event severity on response in patients on
active treatment
Neither for patients treated with paroxetine (Figure 3) nor for
those treated with citalopram (Figure 4) was the degree of severity
of the most severe adverse event associated with reduction in
depressed mood.
DISCUSSION
The major finding of this study is that patients treated with either
paroxetine or citalopram report a larger reduction in depressed
mood than those given placebo regardless of if they report
adverse events or not. As such an outcome is not compatible with
Table 1.

 the theory that the beneficial effect of antidepressants is largely or
solely the result of these drugs enhancing the expectation of
improvement by causing side effects,1–8 our results indirectly
support the notion that the two drugs under study do display
genuine antidepressant effects caused by their pharmacodynamic
properties.
Whereas the primary analyses addressed the possible influence
of adverse events occurring during weeks 1–2 on the reduction in
depressed mood in the observed cases population, a number of
sensitivity analyses using alternative strategies for addressing the
issue at stake were also undertaken. For example, as it may be
argued that only adverse events that are likely to be the result of
SSRI administration should lead to unblinding, two of these
analyses addressed the effect of only considering those adverse
events which were judged as possibly and/or probably related to
paroxetine treatment by the investigator; the outcome of these
were however entirely in line with those of the primary analyses.
Likewise, sensitivity analyses (i) assessing the possible effect of
replacing depressed mood with HDRS-17-sum as primary effect
parameter (ii) including all subjects with at least one post-baseline
visit using the last-observation-carried forward principle (the
intention-to-treat population) rather than just completers, or (iii)
modifying the criteria for when the adverse events should occur to
be considered, also provided no reason to revise the conclusion
based on the primary analyses. Moreover, the outcome of
comparisons of SSRI-treated subjects without early adverse events
with placebo-treated subjects also without early adverse events
and of SSRI-treated subjects with early adverse events with
placebo-treated subjects also reporting early adverse events, were
in line with those of the primary analyses. Finally, sensitivity
analyses using the full HDRS-17-sum as outcome parameter
showed similar results as those regarding depressed mood, a
notable exception being that citalopram-treated patients with
adverse events did not significantly outperform placebo-treated
patients (while citalopram-treated patients without adverse events
did) (Supplementary Figures 11 and 12).
Paroxetine-treated patients consistently displayed a small but
significant positive association between early adverse events and
reduction in depressed mood (but not HDRS-17-sum). Whereas
this observation could be interpreted as support for side effects
exerting some impact on the response to the drug through
unblinding, side effects and response might obviously correlate,
without being causally related, due to inter-individual differences
in factors such as dose, compliance, drug metabolism and
responsiveness to the pharmacodynamic effects of the drug.
Notably, we however observed no corresponding association in
citalopram-treated
subjects.
Although
there
is
no
obvious
explanation as to why the data regarding the two drugs differ
in this regard, this may tentatively be related to differences with
respect to how the two companies designed their trials with
respect to dose levels, dosing regime (that is, fixed doses versus
flexible dosing) and how adverse event information was obtained,
but possibly also to drug-related differences in adverse event
acceptability at the elected dose levels. Of note is that there were
no significant associations between early adverse events and
response in placebo-treated patients in either the citalopram or
the paroxetine trials (data not shown).
Whereas the presence of side effects was hence not a strong
predictor for response in SSRI-treated subjects, it should be noted
that all studies utilized a single-blind placebo lead-in period that
might
eliminate
patients
most
inclined
to
experience
an
expectation-induced symptom relief. This possibility, however,
has no bearing on the issue addressed in this study, that is,
whether the
difference
between
active
drug and
placebo
observed in many controlled trials may be attributed to side
effects breaking the blind in patients given active medication.

SSRI efficacy in the absence of adverse events
F Hieronymus et al
1734
Molecular Psychiatry (2018), 1731 – 1736
 The primary analyses as well as most of the sensitivity analyses
suggest the ESs for the reduction in depressed mood in patients
not reporting adverse events to be between 0.3 and 0.5, that is,
small to moderate. When interpreting these results in terms of
clinical significance, one should consider the fact that many of the
included trials comprised treatment arms with suboptimal dosage;
the presented ESs, similar to those obtained in most meta-
analyses regarding antidepressants, are hence lower than one may
expect when using adequate doses.18
The fact that the presence of side effects might compromise the
integrity of the double-blind procedure in both raters20–23 and
patients,3,24–26 and that the resulting unblinding may introduce a
bias favoring the active drug, has been discussed since long.
During the '60s and '70s, when most antidepressants displayed
easily recognizable anticholinergic side effects, attempts were
made to explore this possibility by comparing antidepressants
with so-called active
placebos, that is, drugs
exerting no
antidepressant effect but being anticholinergic. Finding the ES
for the difference between tricyclic antidepressants and such
active placebos to be small (0.17), the authors of a Cochrane
report27 suggested the specific effects of antidepressants to be
overestimated. Several of the nine studies analyzed, six of which
were conducted in the '60s, were however small and/or marred by
methodological
shortcomings
including
short
duration
and
possible underdosing. Moreover, the modest ES of 0.17 was
obtained after a post hoc exclusion of a trial regarded as an
outlier. Including this trial yielded a highly significant difference
between antidepressants and active placebo with an ES of 0.39,
which is well in line with studies comparing antidepressants with
inert placebos. Of note is also that other authors analyzing this
literature have concluded that the outcome of trials using active
placebo do not support the suggestion that the studied drugs lack
specific antidepressant properties.28,29
Another argument that has been put forward, for example by
Kirsch,6 as support for the placebo-breaking-the-blind hypothesis
is that an analysis based on six trials comparing the SSRI fluoxetine
with placebo showed side effects to correlate significantly with
efficacy.9 However, this study did not analyze the association
between side effects and response in individual patients but used
trial level meta-analysis. Of note is also that a more recent trial-
based meta-analysis, including a much larger set of studies
(n = 68), failed to replicate the correlation.10
Supporting the assumption that antidepressants do not act
merely by means of a placebo effect, depressed patients were
treated with drugs, including central stimulants, barbiturates,
opiates and antipsychotics, but without satisfactory effect,30 even
before the serendipitous discovery of the first antidepressants,
imipramine and iproniazide;31 had drug treatment of depression
been merely a matter of a psychological placebo response, these
compounds should have appeared just as effective as imipramine
or iproniazide. Moreover, a large number of trials have revealed
significant differences between two antidepressants (or putative
antidepressants) in trials including no placebo arm;32–36 had the
superiority of antidepressants over placebo in controlled trials
been merely the result of the patient realizing that he/she has not
been given active treatment, such an outcome would be difficult
to explain given that the participants in these trials knew that they
were not at risk of receiving placebo. The present data, suggesting
that antidepressants do not act merely by means of a placebo
effect, are well in line with these observations.
Two limitations of this study should be addressed. First, as it
only includes data from studies regarding paroxetine or citalo-
pram, it does not allow any conclusions regarding the possible
influence of side effects on the response to other antidepressants.
The observation that, for these two drugs, a clear-cut difference
between groups was observed also in patients not reporting
adverse events should however be sufficient to falsify the theory
that all drugs regarded as antidepressants exert their action
merely by means of their side effects. Second, the possibility that
subtle adverse events that are recognized by the patient, but not
of sufficient
severity
to be recorded,
could
influence the
expectation of improvement, should not be excluded. However,
the relatively low percentage of patients not reporting any early
adverse events in most trials argues against side effects being
under-reported. Of note in this context is that the suggestion by
Kirsch of an association between side effect severity and
response6 gained no support from the analyses assessing this
possibility (Figures 3 and 4).
In summary, although this study does not allow any firm
conclusions with respect to the possible existence of a modest
association
between
early
side
effects
and
antidepressant
response for SSRIs, the results for paroxetine and citalopram
being divergent in this regard, it casts serious doubt on the
assumption that the superiority of antidepressants over placebo is
entirely or largely due to side effects enhancing the placebo effect
of the active compound by breaking the blind. We conclude that
that the placebo-breaking-the-blind theory has come to influence
the current view on the efficacy of antidepressants to a greater
extent than can be justified by available data.
