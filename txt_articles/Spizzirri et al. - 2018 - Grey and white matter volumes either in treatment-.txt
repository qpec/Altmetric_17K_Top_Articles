Many previous magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have documented sex differences in brain 
morphology, but the patterns of sexual brain differences in transgender women – male sex assigned at 
birth – with a diagnosis of gender dysphoria (TW) have been rarely investigated to date. We acquired 
T1-weighted MRI data for the following four (n = 80) groups: treatment-naïve TW (TNTW), TW treated 
with cross-sex hormones for at least one year (TTW), cisgender men, and cisgender women (cisgender 
individuals as controls). Differences in whole-brain and regional white matter volume and grey matter 
volume (GMV) were assessed using voxel-based morphometry. We found lower global brain volumes 
and regional GMVs in a large portion of the posterior-superior frontal cortex in the cisgender women 
group than in the TTW and cisgender men groups. Additionally, both transgender groups exhibited 
lower bilateral insular GMVs than the cisgender women group. Our results highlight differences in the 
insula in both transgender groups; such differences may be characteristic of TW. Furthermore, these 
alterations in the insula could be related to the neural network of body perception and reflect the 
distress that accompanies gender dysphoria.
Transgender people (frequently referred to as trans people) experience incongruence between their personal 
sense of gender identity and their sex assigned at birth1. According to the DSM-5 classification, trans people who 
suffer significant distress associated with their gender perception are diagnosed with gender dysphoria, which is 
characterized by distress accompanying the incongruence between one’s sex assigned at birth and the gender with 
which one identifies. Although not all individuals express discomfort as a result of this discordance, many may 
experience personal anguish if hormone and/or surgical intervention is not available2. Considering that the aeti-
ology of gender dysphoria is unknown, it has been postulated that foetal sexual brain differentiation during the 
second half of pregnancy does not correspond to the development of the rest of the body in transgender people. 
This assumption implies that neuroanatomical features reflective of the causative processes that determine gender 
dysphoria may be detectable in the brain3.
Many neuroimaging studies to date have investigated sex differences in brain morphology. Initial investi-
gations in this field have demonstrated regional brain volume differences between men and women through 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) based on brain regions of interest (ROIs) defined manually or with semi-
automated techniques4,5. The introduction of voxel-based morphometry (VBM) has made it feasible to conduct 
voxel-wise comparisons in an automated fashion across the whole brain. Many subsequent VBM studies have 
reported findings indicating sexual differences in the human brain regarding the volumes of specific structures6,7.

In addition, the results of brain volumetric studies have been complemented by MRI studies that have investi-
gated sex differences in regard to measurements of cortical thickness across the whole brain8,9.
In a recently published meta-analysis of MRI studies on this subject using VBM or tensor-based morphometry 
(which also affords measures of regional brain volumes and grey matter density), Ruigrock et al. concluded that 
sexual differences in brain volumes, most notably in the insula (related to human consciousness), limbic struc-
tures (emotion, behaviour and motivation, among others), basal ganglia (numerous functions, including control 
of voluntary motor movements, learning and cognition), thalamus (sensory and motor signals to the cerebral cor-
tex), language-related cortical regions and cerebellum (motor control and cognitive functions), may be detected 
with MRI10. Furthermore, previous VBM studies have also reported findings of white matter volume (WMV) sex 
differences in the cerebellum, cerebral lobes and corpus callosum7,11.
All MRI studies in this field to date have suggested that the sex/gender of the brain does not present such 
well-defined characteristics presented by the genitalia12–14. A recent study showed that this distinction would 
only be possible if sex/gender differences in brain characteristics were highly dimorphic and if brains were 
inherently congruent with male or female sex/gender. Although this study noted differences in sex/gender and 
behaviour, the human brain has a variety of individual characteristics that may each be more masculine or femi-
nine. Consequently, human brains cannot be classified into two distinct categories of “male brain” versus “female 
brain”15. Likewise, there is a growing a social trend considering gender as a continuum, rather than distinct male 
and female genders16.
The possible brain anatomical features associated with transgender women −
 male sex assigned at birth −
 
with gender dysphoria diagnosis (TW) have been rarely investigated to date. The first MRI study of TW used a 
ROI-based method, focusing on the corpus callosum, and did not show differences between TW and cisgender 
men (CM) or cisgender women (CW) controls17. A decade later, one study reported that the corpus callosum pat-
tern in TW was congruent with gender identity18. To date, four VBM studies investigating differences in regional 
grey matter volume (GMV) have compared transgender people with cisgender controls. The first of these studies 
on adult TW showed that the right putamen had a greater GMV in treatment-naïve TW (TNTW) than in CM19. 
The second study demonstrated greater GMV in the temporo-parietal junction, the inferior frontal cortex and the 
insular cortex of the right hemisphere in TNTW than in cisgender controls, as well as between-group volumetric 
differences of the putamen and the thalamus20. The third VBM study showed lower regional GMV in the left 
angular gyrus and the inferior parietal lobule in the transgender group21. The fourth study evaluated adolescents 
and noted lower volume of the cerebellum (bilaterally) and the hypothalamus in transgender girls than in cisgen-
der boys22. Two other studies examined cortical thickness measurements in TNTW and demonstrated consistent 
results, that is, higher cortical thickness in TNTW than in CM controls23,24. Although reported findings have been 
heterogeneous to date, the above VBM studies detected GMV variations in the angular gyrus, the insula and the 
putamen of TW19–21. These brain regions were hypothesized to be relevant in transgender people because they are 
related to the neural network of body perception20,21.
Only one previous VBM study of TNTW has assessed regional WMV and verified that TNTW exhibit lower 
WMV in the precentral area than CW20. On the other hand, the white matter (WM) microstructure of TW has 
been evaluated using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in previous MRI studies. One study showed that the frac-
tional anisotropy of several fasciculi in TNTW was halfway between those of CM and CW controls25. Another 
study did not find differences in fractional anisotropy between TNTW and cisgender controls, although the mean 
diffusivity in CW and TNTW was higher than that in CM26. Overall, these MRI studies have provided some evi-
dence supporting the view that there may be regional GMV and WMV differences between TW and cisgender 
controls. However, the patterns detected thus far are not clearly associated with female brain characteristics, 
thus raising the possibility that TW-related brain volume differences are not necessarily related to signs of brain 
feminization27.
All the abovementioned VBM studies of adult TW were performed before cross-sex hormone treatment 
(CHT). However, it is important to note that most TW have a history of prolonged use of sex steroids. Three VBM 
studies have investigated the influence of circulating sex steroids on cisgender individuals and have reported the 
following findings: (i) sex hormones influence the organization of the grey matter (GM) in cortical regions during 
adolescence and adulthood6, (ii) increased levels of circulating testosterone during puberty in boys are associated 
with sexual differences in the amygdala and the hippocampus28, and (iii), increased levels of 17β
-oestradiol in 
girls are related to sexual differences in GM29. Another ROI-based MRI study investigated the influence of CHT 
for four months in TW and demonstrated the presence of brain volume reductions towards female proportions30. 
In another MRI study, cortical thickness in TW was assessed prior to and after six months of CHT, and evidence 
that sex steroids are associated with reduced cortical and subcortical structures was reported31.
To further analyse possible brain anatomical features associated with TW and the influence of CHT, the pres-
ent cross-sectional MRI study aimed to investigate differences in whole-brain and regional GMV and WMV by 
VBM in two TW groups: TNTW and TW after at least one year of CHT (TTW). These TW groups were com-
pared with CM and CW as control groups. Moreover, by applying the small-volume correction (SVC) method, 
we intended to replicate the findings of previous MRI investigations for the following brain regions: the angular 
gyrus, the insula and the putamen19–21. The corpus callosum, which has also been previously reported to present 
changes in TW18, was additionally assessed by SVC in the current study.
Results
Sample characteristics. 
Table 1 shows the sociodemographic and clinical data for all groups. TW and 
controls did not differ in age, but the schooling level was significantly lower in TNTW than in controls. The total 
testosterone level was significantly lower in TTW than in TNTW (p < 0.001), although the oestradiol level was 
not significantly different between the two groups (p = 0.892). No changes in secondary sexual characteristics, 
which were evaluated by physical examination, were reported for the TNTW group.

Imaging data. 
Total brain volumetric differences. The total brain volumes of the four groups are shown in 
Table 2. There were no significant between-group differences in the total brain volumes between the TW groups. 
All brain compartments showed reduced global volumes in the CW group compared with the three other groups 
(Table 2).
Regional GMV differences. In the whole-brain exploratory analysis, statistical parametric mapping (SPM) 
for ANCOVA comparing regional GMVs between groups showed one large voxel cluster corresponding to a 
between-group difference with a peak statistical significance in the left superior medial frontal gyrus [Brodmann 
area (BA) 6–1240 voxels, peak voxel at x = 0, y = −
7, z = 67; Z = 5.09, pFWE = 0.01 corrected for multiple 
comparisons] that extended bilaterally to the supplementary motor cortex and the paracentral lobule. Post hoc 
two-group comparisons (see Table 3 for details) revealed that the GMV of this large voxel cluster encompassing 
these three brain regions was greater in the TTW group than in the CW group. Although not significant after 
correcting for multiple comparisons, the GMV of the same voxel cluster also tended to be higher in the TNTW 
group than in the CW group (peak voxel at x = 0, y = −
12, z = 75; Z = 2.42, p = 0.002 uncorrected for multiple 
comparisons). Finally, CM also exhibited significantly higher GMVs in the bilateral paracentral lobule, the bilat-
eral supplementary motor cortex and the left precentral gyrus than CW (Table 3).
We further evaluated the SPM for ANCOVA comparing regional GMVs in a priori-selected brain regions 
between groups using the SVC approach, and we observed additional significant findings in the left insula [BA

Post hoc two-group comparisons showed lower GMVs in the bilateral insula in both TW groups than in the CW 
group (Fig. 1) and a lower GMV in the left insula in the TTW group than in the CM group (Table 3). No addi-
tional GMV differences were observed in any other a priori-selected brain regions.
Regional WMV differences. No significant regional WMV differences were observed among the groups in 
the exploratory whole-brain analysis (pFWE < 0.05). Further evaluation of the SPM for ANCOVA comparing 
regional WMVs in a priori-selected brain regions between groups using the SVC approach revealed no statisti-
cally significant clusters (pFWE < 0.05).
Discussion
The present VBM study investigated GMV and WMV patterns in two TW groups that were well-characterized 
regarding their sexual orientation and non-conformity to their sex assigned at birth from an early age. The TNTW 
and TTW subjects were recruited before beginning CHT and at least one year after beginning CHT, respectively, 
which allowed us to differentiate brain volume findings related to TW or CHT.
The lower total brain volume in CW observed here is consistent with a previously reported profile of sexual 
differences in the brain10. The finding that the three other groups presented total brain volumes larger than the 
CW group indicates that these brain volume differences are congruent with the sex assigned at birth in both TW 
groups27. Additionally, no differences in total brain volume were found between the TTW group and the TNTW 
and CM groups in the present cross-sectional study, although overall effects of CHT on reductions in total intrac-
ranial volume (TIV) and total GMV have been observed in other longitudinal MRI studies of TW undergoing 
CHT30,31.
Regarding regional GMV, we found lower GMV bilaterally in the insula in both TW groups, in contrasts to the 
results reported by Savic and Arver (2011), who found higher GMV in the right insula of the TW group relative to 
controls20. Likewise, Zubiarre-Elorza et al. (2013) verified greater cortical thickness in the right insula in TNTW 
than in CM controls23. Another MRI study conducted by Zubiarre-Elorza et al. (2014) reported decreased right 
insular volumes in TW undergoing CHT31. Our finding in the insula is unlikely directly due to CHT because the 
lower GMV of the insula was observed for both TW groups compared with the CW group. Furthermore, brain 
volume and cortical thickness are widely considered as complementary brain measurements32,33.
Manzouri et al.34 recently conducted a morphological and functional MRI study including treatment-naïve 
transgender men - female sex assigned at birth - and cisgender controls. The GMV differences found in the 
transgender men group followed patterns related to the sex assigned at birth. However, the authors also demon-
strated weaker functional connections from the pregenual anterior cingulate to the insular cortex and to the 
temporo-parietal junction in the transgender men than in controls. These findings also suggest that transgender 
men differ from cisgender people with respect to the own-body image neural network, which may be a neurobio-
logical substrate related to transgender men34. Similarly, Savic and Arver (2011) and Simon et al. (2013) suggested 
that regional GMV differences detected in transgender people emphasize the brain regions related to the body 
perception network20,21.
It is worth mentioning that an important diagnostic criterion for gender dysphoria is the distress that accom-
panies the incongruity between the body and gender identity, as the secondary sexual characteristics do not 
belong to the gender with which one identifies35. Decreased insular volumes have been reported in depressed 
subjects with melancholic symptoms36, and these changes in insular and prefrontal cortical volumes may be

specifically associated with the manifestation of psychotic symptoms in major depressive disorder37. The insula is 
related to all subjective sensations and is the possible foundation of interoception38, including body awareness39. 
Furthermore, the insula connects the distinct functional systems involved in processing emotions, sensory-motor 
skills and cognition40. Two studies have evaluated functional connectivity in transgender people and found (i) a 
pattern of neural connectivity that inferred suffering due to incongruity between sex assigned at birth and gender 
identity41, and (ii) that the connectivity between the right insula and the somatosensory cortex was negatively 
related to ratings on a well-being scale in regard to gender dysphoria42. Another study examined brain structural 
connectivity and observed unique differences in regional network efficiency in the insular area in trans people43. 
These observations, together with our findings of reduced GMVs in the insula in both hemispheres in two inde-
pendent TW groups, suggest that such regional GMV differences could be characteristics associated with TW. 
Furthermore, these alterations in the insula could be related to the neural network of body perception and reflect 
the distress that accompanies gender dysphoria. The hypothesis that insular volume variations in TW individuals 
reflect the distress of these individuals should be considered in future studies including large TW samples by 
evaluating significant correlations between GMV and symptom severity ratings. In addition, it is well known that 
the symptoms of gender dysphoria improve with CHT35. As a consequence of symptom relief, the TTW group 
could present a greater insular volume than the TNTW group. However, this possibility was not verified in the 
current study, which suggests that GMV differences in the insular cortex in both TW groups may be related to a 
more general “transgender trait”
.
One important difference between our VBM study and the study performed by Savic and Arver (2011) is that 
the latter investigated non-androphilic TW (sexually attracted to females, both males and females, or neither 
gender)20 according to the Blanchard classification, which is based on the sex assigned at birth of TW44, while our 
study investigated androphilic TW (sexually attracted to males). Therefore, one might speculate that the differ-
ences observed in the insular cortex could be linked to the sexual orientation of TW. It should be noted, however, 
that sexual orientation and gender identity are distinct phenomena. For this reason, overlapping VBM findings

volume correction over the insula) and had a minimum extent threshold of 30 voxels. Statistical details are given

associated with these two conditions are highly speculative. Another VBM study assessing hetero- and homosex-
ual CM did not identify any regional GMV differences between groups. Homosexual CW presented lower GMV 
in the perirhinal cortex than heterosexual CW45. Considering these speculative findings, further MRI studies 
comparing androphilic TW with non-androphilic TW are required to reveal further information on this topic.
We also detected lower regional GMV in a large portion of the posterior-superior frontal cortex in the CW 
controls than in both TW groups and the CM controls. Because our statistical approach was primarily designed 
to identify regional GMV variations that could be related to gender dysphoria, direct post hoc two-group com-
parisons between the cisgender controls in our study should not be considered as comprehensive indicators of 
a predominant profile between the two control groups regarding regional brain volume differences. In addi-
tion, the lower GMV detected in the posterior-superior frontal cortex in the CW group is consistent with previ-
ously described regional patterns of sexual differences of the human brain10,46. Significantly higher GMV in the 
posterior-superior frontal cortex was also detected only in the TTW and CM groups relative to the CW group. 
Conversely, the difference in regional GMV in this frontal region in the TNTW group relative to the CW group 
was not significant after correcting for multiple comparisons. These results of the present study may indicate that 
this brain region in TNTW tends to present female characteristics, although this conclusion should be interpreted 
with caution.
Based on the abovementioned interpretation, the finding of higher GMV in the posterior-superior frontal 
cortex in the TTW group might seem contradictory, given the overall feminizing effects of CHT. Nevertheless, 
previous studies have shown increased GMV in several cortical regions in postmenopausal women under oestro-
gen replacement therapy47, including higher GM density in paracentral and precentral areas48 and in the superior 
frontal gyrus46. Such findings are believed to reflect the influence of hormonal treatment on brain neuroplasticity.
Overall, our results suggest that the impact of CHT on brain volume may vary across regional and global lev-
els, as we found no difference in total brain volume between the two TW groups, despite the fact that the TTW 
had undergone prolonged use of sex steroids. A similar study conducted by Hoekzema et al. (2014) revealed 
that the neuroanatomical characteristics of treatment-naïve transgender adolescents and transgender adolescents 
undergoing CHT corresponded to those of individuals of the same sex assigned at birth.
Such results are in contrast to the findings of previous studies of TW using repeated MRI measurements before 
and during CHT. Hulshoff Pol et al. (2006) reported reduced global brain volumes in TW after four months of 
CHT towards the volumes expected for CW30. Similar to our TW sample, Zubiaurre-Elorza et al. (2014) investi-
gated TW after at least six months of hormonal treatment and reported reduced cortical thicknesses and volumes 
of subcortical structures in the right hemisphere (specifically in the pallidum and the thalamus) and an enlarged 
ventricular system31. A recent study showed increased ventricle and reduced right hippocampal volumes in TW 
after four months of CHT49. These differences between our results and those of previous investigations may be 
because the present study employed a cross-sectional design, while the previous studies were longitudinal inves-
tigations of the same individuals and, thus, may have been more sensitive to detecting CHT-related global volume 
changes over time in TW.
Our findings, as well as the results of all previous brain imaging studies that have evaluated the influence of 
CHT, suggest that the effects of CHT on brain volume may differ at global and regional levels and may vary across 
brain structures. Moreover, the different results obtained for the two TW groups in our study suggest that the 
association of brain volumes with gender dysphoria and CHT may be complex, and furthermore, the direction of 
associations of brain volume with these two dimensions may vary.
Conflicting VBM-based findings among MRI studies of TW regarding subcortical GM structures have been 
reported to date. In the first VBM study to evaluate TW, Luders et al. (2009) identified a greater GMV in the 
right putamen19. Through SVC-based analyses, Savic and Arver (2011) also reported that TW subjects exhibit a 
greater GMV in the right putamen than control subjects; conversely, ROI-based measurements indicated reduced 
volumes of the putamen in TW relative to controls20. In the present study, the SVC-based analysis did not reveal 
significant group differences in voxels located specifically in the basal ganglia (although relatively larger clusters 
of lower GMV in the insula extending towards the right putamen were observed in both TW groups, as shown 
in Fig. 1). Finally, the paucity of between-group differences in the WM analyses in our study suggests that brain 
volume differences related to the effects of both TW and CHT predominate in the GM compartment of the brain.
Some methodological limitations of our study must be considered. First, because this study employed a 
cross-sectional design, it was not possible to determine which changes were pre-existing and which resulted from 
CHT. Second, our sample size can be considered small (n = 80) and may not confer confidence in the results 
obtained, although the sample size was similar to those in previous MRI studies in this field20,23,43. Third, variabil-
ity existed in the duration of CHT among individuals in the TTW group. Finally, the stage of the menstrual cycle 
of the CW was not considered at the time of MRI scanning, which may be a relevant factor considering that brain 
structures are influenced by hormonal physiological variations50.
In conclusion, significant regional brain volume differences in this VBM study were detected in TW compared 
with cisgender controls. In TTW, the observed brain volume changes suggested a possible influence of CHT on 
brain neuroplasticity46,47. Finally, we present a novel finding of GMV alterations in the insula in the two inde-
pendent TW groups, which may be a characteristic of TW. These alterations in the insula could be related to the 
neural network of body perception and may reflect the distress that accompanies gender dysphoria.
Methods
Sample. 
Inclusion criteria for all TW were as follows: (a) absence of changes (except for changes resulting 
from the use of CHT by TTW) in secondary male sex characteristics according to the Marshall and Tanner 
criteria51, as evaluated by a physical examination performed by endocrinologists at HC-FMUSP; (b) a history 
of non-conformity to birth sex since the early stages of child development; (c) compatibility with gender

dysphoria diagnostic criteria as per the DSM-5 and based on semi-structured interviews conducted by three 
mental health professionals (one psychiatrist and two psychologists); and (d) exclusive sexual attraction to 
males according to the Kinsey scale of sexual orientation52, as ascertained by actively asking TW about their 
sexual attraction (i.e., reports on desire, thoughts, fantasies and/or sexual activity with men, including roman-
tic ideas). Specific inclusion criteria for the TNTW group were as follows: the absence of any hormonal treat-
ment history and the expressed desire to be treated with CHT. The procedures performed in TNTW included 
evaluations of the plasma levels of oestradiol, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, testosterone 
and free testosterone on the day of MRI. For TTW, the specific inclusion criterion was currently receiving 
CHT for at least one year, as recommended by the Endocrinology Service at HC-FMUSP. This treatment 
regimen consisted of the administration of one or two 0.625-mg conjugated oestrogen tablets and one 50-mg 
cyproterone acetate pill per day53. Blood hormone levels of the TTW group were evaluated every semester. 
Hormone dosages of all TW were calculated in the Hormones Laboratory and Molecular Genetics LIM-42 at 
HC-FMUSP via immunofluorometric assays using AutoDELFIA kits (PerkinElmer Inc., Waltham, MA, USA). 
For the cisgender controls, the inclusion criterion was heterosexual orientation, as determined by the Kinsey 
scale of sexual orientation52.
Exclusion criteria based on the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders (SCID)54 
for all groups included a history of psychiatric disorders and prior use of psychopharmacological agents. 
Additional exclusion criteria included the presence of medical conditions or neurological disorders that 
could affect the central nervous system, contraindications to MRI, major medical illnesses, and substance 
abuse.
The study sample included 80 individuals between 18 and 49 years of age divided into the following four 
groups (n = 20 each): TNTW, TTW, CW and CM (cisgender individuals as healthy controls). The selection of 
TNTW was based on a waiting list of those individuals who identified themselves as transgender women and who 
were awaiting treatment at HC-FMUSP, contacts with non-governmental organizations that provide assistance 
to transgender people and contacts with mental health expert clinicians who practice in São Paulo and who were 
able to refer patients for the study. The TTW group was selected from among those patients who were already 
receiving treatment at HC-FMUSP. Healthy voluntary controls were verbally invited among community and staff 
members at HC-FMUSP.
All participants were fully informed about the study and signed a consent form. This study followed the prin-
ciples of the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Ethics Committee at the Medical School Hospital, 
University of São Paulo (HC-FMUSP), Brazil.
Image acquisition and processing. 
All MRI scans were acquired using a 1.5 T Siemens Espree sys-
tem (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) at the Institute of Psychiatry, HC-FMUSP. Morphological brain data were 
acquired using a T1-weighted magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo sequence (MPRAGE) with the 
following parameters: TR = 2,400 ms; TE = 3.65 ms; NEX = 1; field of view (FOV) = 240 mm; flip angle = 8o; 
matrix = 192 ×
 192 pixels; slice thickness = 1.2 mm (no gap between slices); and voxel size = 1.25 ×
 1.25 ×
 1.2 mm, 
resulting in 160 slices covering the whole brain.
All images were reviewed by a neuroradiologist with the purpose of identifying artefacts during image acqui-
sition and the presence of silent gross brain alterations. VBM processing was performed using the Statistical 
Parametric Mapping (SPM) program, version 8 (Wellcome Trust Centre of Neuroimaging, London, United 
Kingdom), implemented in MATLAB R2012a (MathWorks, Sherborn, Massachusetts). First, all anatomical 
images were reoriented; the mm coordinate of the anterior commissure matched the x y z origin (0, 0, 0), and 
the orientation approximated Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space. The images were then segmented 
into GM, WM and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) partitions using the unified segmentation procedure described 
by Ashburner and Friston55. The Diffeomorphic Anatomical Registration Through Exponentiated Lie Algebra 
(DARTEL) algorithm was then used to spatially normalize the segmented images. This procedure maximizes sen-
sitivity and the accuracy of localization by registering individual structural images to an asymmetric T1-weighted 
template derived from participants’ structural images rather than a standard T1-weighted template based on a 
different sample56.
These fully normalized images were resliced through trilinear interpolation to a final voxel size of 
1.5 ×
 1.5 ×
 1.5 mm³. An additional “modulation” step consisted of multiplying each spatially normalized GM and 
WM image by its relative volume before and after normalization. This step ensured that the total amount of GM 
and WM in each voxel was preserved. Finally, the resulting GM and WM images were smoothed using an 8-mm 
isotropic kernel at full width at half maximum (FWHM) to ensure normal distribution of the data as required by 
subsequent statistical parametric tests.
Statistical analysis. 
Demographical and clinical data. The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences 
(SPSS) for Windows, version 18.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA) was used. All statistical tests were conducted with a 
5% significance level. Age and education in years were compared between groups using the Kruskal-Wallis test. 
Differences in hormonal levels between the TW groups were verified by the Mann-Whitney U-test. Fisher’s exact 
test was used to evaluate handedness.
Neuroimaging data. Total GM, WM and CSF volumes were calculated by the MATLAB get_totals script (http://
www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/g.ridgway/vbm/get_totals.m) implemented for SPM8 using the segmented images on the 
native space for each subject. Between-group differences in total GM, CSF and WM volumes, total tissue volume 
(TV, calculated as GM + WM), and TIV (calculated as GM + WM + CSF) were tested with analysis of variance 
(ANOVA) using SPSS. Age and years of education were included as covariates in such comparisons.

Regarding the VBM analyses, we initially performed exploratory voxel-wise comparisons of regional GMVs 
and WMVs among the 4 groups across the whole brain using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model in SPM 
(F test). Given the between-group differences in years of education, this variable was included as a covariate in 
such comparisons. Although the mean age was not significantly different in between groups, age was also entered 
as a further confounding covariate. The age range of the overall sample was relatively wide (from 18 to 49 years), 
and in such situations, previous VBM studies have shown that it is appropriate to include age as a confounding 
covariate in between-group comparisons57. The measures of total GM or WM in the brain were also entered as 
confounders in the respective ANCOVA. Only voxels with values above an absolute threshold of p = 0.05 for dif-
ferentiating GM and WM from other tissues were included in the analyses. Significant ANCOVA findings were 
followed up with post hoc tests for two-group comparisons (t tests). The resulting statistics were thresholded at a 
p < 0.001 (uncorrected for multiple comparisons) level of significance (Z = 3.09) and displayed as SPMs in stand-
ard anatomical space. Only clusters with a minimum of 30 voxels were reported (30 voxels correspond to approx-
imately 100 mm3; this threshold has been used in previous studies21,58 and offers an easy-to-understand size scale 
for the reader). Findings in these exploratory analyses were considered significant if they survived family-wise 
error (FWE) correction for multiple comparisons over the whole brain (pFWE ≤
 0.05).
Subsequently, each statistical map was inspected for the presence of clusters of significant differences in brain 
regions where volumetric differences had been predicted a priori through the SVC method, with the purpose 
of constraining the total number of voxels included in the analysis. Each GM region was spatially delimited 
by applying masks onto the SPMs, based on the anatomical volumes of interest that are available within the 
automatic anatomical labelling SPM toolbox (http://www.gin.cnrs.fr/AAL). All the anatomical masks were used 
separately in each hemisphere. SVC was applied over the following brain regions: the angular gyrus, the insula 
and the putamen. These regions were predicted a priori to show differences in VBM studies of TNTW19–21. For 
SVC-based analyses of WM regions18, ROIs over the corpus callosum (body, genu, and splenium) were defined 
based on the JHU DTI-based WM atlases59–61. Findings for these hypothesis-driven, SVC-based analyses were 
reported as significant if they survived FWE correction for multiple comparisons (pFWE ≤
 0.05) over the search 
volume of each ROI, with a cluster size threshold of 30 contiguous voxels.
