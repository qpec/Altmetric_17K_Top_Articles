 Surgical Revision after Sacroiliac Joint Fixation or Fusion
Katie Spain, BS, Timothy Holt, MD

Abstract
Background
Minimally invasive sacroiliac joint (SIJ) fusion has been shown to be safe and effective for the treatment of SIJ dys-
function. Multiple devices are available to perform SIJ fixation or fusion. Surgical revision rates after these proce-
dures have not been directly compared.
Methods
We retrospectively identified all patients in our practice who underwent SIJ fixation or fusion between 2003 and
2015. Using both chart review and focused contact with individual patients, we determined the likelihood of surgi-
cal revision. Revision rates were compared using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis.
Results
Thirty-eight patients underwent SIJ fixation with screws and 274 patients underwent SIJ fusion using triangular ti-
tanium implants. Four-year cumulative revision rates were 30.8% for fixation and 5.7% for fusion.
Conclusions
In our study, SIJ fixation with screws had a much higher revision rate compared to SIJ fusion with triangular titani-
um implants designed for bone adherence.

Background
The sacroiliac joint (SIJ) is increasingly recognized
as a common cause of chronic low back pain. In pa-
tients presenting for evaluation of low back pain, the
SIJ may play a role in 15-30% of cases.1-5 The SIJ is
even more commonly suspected (up to 40%6,7) as a
source of low back pain in patients who have under-
gone prior lumbar fusion, possibly due to adjacent
segment degeneration. Currently available treatment
options for SIJ dysfunction include physical therapy,8
SIJ steroid injections,9,10 RF ablation of the lateral
branches of the sacral nerve roots,11,12 and open13 or
minimally invasive14-18 SIJ surgery. Two recently pub-
lished surgery vs. non-surgery randomized clinical
trials of SIJ fusion using triangular titanium implants
(TTI, iFuse Implant System, SI-BONE, Inc., San
Jose, CA) showed that subjects undergoing SIJ fu-
sion had large and statistically superior improve-
ments in SIJ pain, pain-related disability and quality
of life compared to those randomized to non-surgical
care.19,20
Several approaches and implants are available to per-
form minimally invasive SIJ fixation or fusion, in-
cluding dorsal and lateral transfixing approaches.
Moreover, strategies can include fixation only or fixa-
tion plus fusion. Fusion strategies include devices
with coatings that have previously been shown to
promote bone ongrowth21-23 or joint disruption with
placement of graft materials.
Published literature on the dorsal approach is
sparse24-26 and some studies report very little im-
provement with this approach.24 In contrast, the pub-
lished literature on lateral transfixing approaches is
larger, with a small number of reports of hollow mod-
ular anchor screws27-29 and a larger number of reports
of TTI, including retrospective case series,15,16,30-34 a
combined multicenter analysis,35 a prospective multi-
center study36 and two prospective randomized tri-
als.19,20
The need to revise a surgically fused joint is a topic
of interest to surgeons and their patients. As report-

 ed by the manufacturer, the revision rate after SIJ fu-
sion using TTI is low (3.6% at 4 years)37 and clinical
trials have shown similar revision rates. TTI are
specifically designed for SIJ fusion, with the triangu-
lar shape preventing rotational motion and the
porous coating promoting biological fixation in bone.
The extent to which this design improves over SIJ
fixation with screws is not known. Herein we report a
comparison of surgical revision rates between these
two approaches.
Methods
Patients at a single spine surgeon practice who were
at least 19 years old at the time of surgery and under-
went SIJ fixation or fusion were identified through
manual review and querying office billing databases.
The fixation procedure was performed using cannu-
lated 7.2 mm diameter stainless steel screws (Syn-
thes, Figure 1. Postoperative AP pelvic x-ray showing
typical results from SIJ fixation (left, A) and SIJ fu-
sion (right, B). Figure 1a) as follows. With the patient
in the prone position on a Jackson table, 2 or 3
guidewires (depending on patient body habitus) were
inserted under fluoroscopic guidance across the SIJ.
Following confirmation of pin placement, a 5.5 mm
drill was used to drill across the joint and about 2.5
mm into the sacrum. Screws were placed and final
imaging was done in the AP, outlet, and inlet views.
Live fluoroscopy was also utilized in a 180-degree arc
to ensure purchase across the joint. The entire proce-
dure was performed through small (2-5 mm) punc-
tures thru the skin in a percutaneous fashion. SIJ fu-
sion with TTI (Figure 1. Postoperative AP pelvic x-
ray showing typical results from SIJ fixation (left, A)
and SIJ fusion (right, B).Figure 1b) was performed as
previously described.30 All procedures were per-
formed under general anesthesia and using fluoro-
scopic guidance. Through chart review, demographic
information and index surgery date were collected
and recorded in a study database. Patients known to
be dead were reviewed but did not otherwise partici-
pate in telephone calls (see below). Patients who un-
derwent revision by the practice’s surgeon (TH)
were identified, and the circumstances of revision
were noted through review of operative notes and
clinic charts. Each patient’s date of last clinic visit
was identified.
Patients who had not been seen within 120 days of
data collection were contacted by telephone. If con-
tacted, verbal consent was obtained for further study
participation. Each participating patient was remind-
ed of his/her SIJ fixation or fusion by the study sur-
geon. Using lay language, the patient was asked
whether the index side had undergone surgical revi-
sion by a physician other than the study author. If a
revision took place unknown to the authors, an oper-
ative note was obtained (no such cases were ob-
served). If the patient could not be contacted or re-
fused to speak with study authors, this was noted in
the study database. The study was approved by a re-
gional institutional review board prior to initiation.
The study was sponsored by SI-BONE, Inc. (which
manufactures the TTI used for SIJ fusion in our co-
hort).
Baseline characteristics were compared across co-
horts using t tests or Wilcoxon tests for continuous
variables and chi-squared tests for nominal variables.

 was calculated using Kaplan-Meier analysis.38 Analy-
sis was done at the “side” level (to account for a
small proportion of patients who underwent bilateral
SIJ fusion.) For patients who underwent revision,
time was calculated as the number of days from
surgery to first revision. For patients who did not un-
dergo revision surgery, follow-up time was calculated
as surgery date to either last clinic visit or the date of
telephone contact. In a small number of patients, the
chart could not be located or the index surgery date
could not be identified; these patients were removed
from the analysis. The log-rank statistic was calculat-
ed. Demographic factors possibly predicting the like-
lihood of surgical revision were explored using a sim-
ilar approach. All statistical analysis was performed
using R.39
Results
According to available records, 274 patients under-
went index SIJ fusion using triangular titanium im-
plants (TTI) and 38 patients underwent SIJ fixation
using screws. Records from 20 patients (11 TTI and
9 screw) could not be located (Figure 2). Demo-
graphic and clinical characteristics of included pa-
tients are shown in Table 1. Age was higher by about
8 years in the SIJ fusion group but gender and body
mass index were similar. Patients undergoing SIJ fix-
ation underwent surgery approximately 6 years be-
fore those undergoing SIJ fusion with TTI.
All patients whose charts were located and who were
seen more than 120 days prior to study start were
telephoned. Of the patients not known to have un-
dergone revision who were last seen in clinic more
than 120 days prior to study start, 91.1% were suc-
cessfully contacted, 7.6% could not be contacted, and
in 1.3% contact was established with a family member
but not the patient himself/herself. No patient con-
tacted by phone had undergone SIJ revision by an-
other surgeon. Mean (median) follow-up time was
2.8 (3.2) years in the SIJ fusion group and 4.6 (4.9)
years in the SIJ fixation group.
Based on review of clinic charts, a total of 31 patients
underwent SIJ revision (19 in the fixation group and
12 in the SIJ fusion group). Revision was typically for
pain recurrence, and some patients showed evidence
of radiolucencies around implants (Figure 3). Using
survival analysis techniques, the cumulative proba-
bility of revision was lower in the fusion group com-
pared to the fixation group (Figure 4, p<.0001); the
4-year cumulative probability of revision in the fusion
group was 5.7% in the fusion group and 30.8% in the
fixation group. As of the longest follow-up time
point, the cumulative probability of revision in the
screw group was 79.8%. Subgroup analysis showed no
predictors of revision other than implant used.
Discussion
SIJ fusion is an increasingly accepted surgical treat-
ment option for chronic SIJ dysfunction related to
degeneration or disruption of the SIJ. Both SIJ fixa-
tion and SIJ fusion work by acutely stabilizing the

 painful joint. SIJ fusion allows long-term immobility
as a result of adherence of the bone to the lateral
transfixing implant as well as bone growing in the SIJ
itself.33
Surgical approaches and strategies (and associated
devices) for the treatment of SIJ dysfunction vary.
Several devices are available for a lateral transfixing
approach, including screw-based devices and trian-
gular titanium implants (TTI, iFuse Implant Sys-
tem). The literature for TTI includes 2 prospective
randomized controlled trials, a large prospective
study and several case series. TTI are designed both
to resist rotational motion after insertion and to pro-
mote biological fixation in bone.
In our practice, we switched from screws to TTI in
early 2012. We noticed that a much smaller propor-
tion of patients returned to clinic with complaints of
continued SIJ pain. Surgical revision was required in
a large proportion of patients who underwent screw-
based fixation. In contrast, the surgical revision rate
when using TTI was low, and similar to that reported
in the literature.37
The failure mode in patients undergoing screw fixa-
tion was primarily loosening and recurrence of pain.
The failure mode for patients undergoing TTI was
traumatic fracture of the iliac wing secondary to a fall
(1 case), malposition of the implant and loosening of
the implant(s). It is our belief that standard surgical
screws do not have a component that promotes bio-
logical fixation in bone, and screw loosening in other
applications is common. Whether the modifications
in screws incorporated into other FDA-cleared de-
vices for SIJ fusion improve upon screw fixation is
not known, and few published data are available to
support improved effectiveness.
Limitations
Our study has several limitations. First, follow-up in
the TTI group was shorter than in the SIJ fixation
group, primarily because the TTI group was operat-
ed on more recently. Not all TTI patients have
4-year follow-up, so the 4-year revision rate is poten-
tially subject to change. Second, we could not con-
tact locate charts for some patients, potentially intro-
ducing a bias. Third, we could not contact a small
number of patients. It is possible that patients who
could not be contacted underwent revision surgery;
however, no other surgeon local to our practice per-
forms such procedures. Third, the time periods for
the two groups differ, suggesting that temporal fac-
tors, such as surgeon learning curve, changes in OR
policies, or postoperative care regimens, could play a
role. However, the surgical technique used to per-
form the SIJ fixation and fusion procedures has not
evolved in any important way. Differences are there-
fore mostly likely due to underlying device design.
The number of patients in each group was markedly
different, with a smaller number of cases undergoing
SIJ fixation. The difference in number of cases is due
to the availability of TTI devices that appeared to
provide better pain relief, at least in the short-term.
Observing better results, the desirability of perform-
ing the procedure increased, resulting in more treat-
ed patients. Finally, we did not assess pain relief or
disability improvement, which have been addressed
by other studies.

 Conclusions
Surgical revision after SIJ fixation using screws was
required far more commonly compared to SIJ fusion
using TTI. The device and surgical approach may
make an important difference in the overall success
of surgical treatments for SIJ dysfunction.
