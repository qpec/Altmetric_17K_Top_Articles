Aging is the biggest risk factor for the development of chronic diseases. Telomere length may 
represent one important mechanism by which dietary intake influences age-related diseases; 
however, it is unknown which diet pattern is most strongly related to telomere length. We 
compared the relations between four evidence-based diet quality indices and leukocyte telomere 
length in a nationally representative sample of healthy adults, and the extent to which these 
associations differ between men and women. Data came from 4,758 adults, aged 20-65 years, 
with no prior diagnosis of major chronic disease, from the 1999-2002 National Health and 
Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES). Diet was assessed using one 24-hour dietary recall.

After adjusting for sociodemographic and health characteristics, comparing the top and bottom 
quintiles showed that higher Healthy Eating Index-2010 (β=0.065, 95% CI 0.018, 0.112, P-
trend=0.007), AHEI-2010 scores (β=0.054, 95% CI 0.010, 0.097, P-trend=0.007), 
Mediterranean Diet scores (β=0.058, 95% CI 0.017, 0.098, P-trend=0.008), and Dietary 
Approaches to Stopping Hypertension (DASH) scores (β=0.052, 95% CI 0.014, 0.090, P-
trend=0.007) were each associated with longer telomere length in women. These results may 
provide insight into the complex associations between optimal nutrition and longevity. Further 
investigation is needed to understand why associations were not observed in men.  
 
 
Telomeres are the DNA-protein caps at the end of eukaryotic chromosomes that promote 
chromosomal stability and protect the genomic DNA from damage (1). Telomere length 
naturally shortens with each cell cycle. When telomere length reaches a critical short length, the 
cell is no longer able to divide and reaches senescence, a mechanism that may underlie age-
related disease processes (2, 3). While chronological age is among the strongest predictors of 
telomere length, studies have recently shown that telomere length is also sensitive to lifestyle 
behaviors like physical activity (4), smoking (5), and dietary intake (6). Telomere length has also 
been inversely related to risk of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and some cancers (7-11). 
 
Many studies have examined dietary intake in relation to telomere length, but across 
studies there is little agreement in specific foods, food groups, or nutrients that are beneficial or 
harmful for telomere length (6). The lack of consistency in findings may be due, in part, to the 
fact that foods are not consumed in isolation, but with complementary foods and nutrients that 
can have synergistic and larger effects on health outcomes (12). Diet pattern analysis captures 
the cumulative effects of foods and nutrients consumed in one’s diet, viewing these dietary

4 
components as an integrated system rather than as individual factors. To date, there have been 
seven studies examining the associations between diet quality indices and telomere length. Three 
of these studies used empirically derived diet patterns, often termed the Prudent and the Western 
patterns, which organize foods commonly consumed together in the analytic population (13-15). 
A diet characterized by high intakes of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, fish, poultry, and 
legumes, and labeled a ‘prudent’ pattern, was positively associated with telomere length in a 
study of middle-aged and older Koreans (14), marginally associated with telomere length in a 
study of healthy US women (13), and not associated with telomere length in a racial/ethnically 
diverse group of US adults (15). In contrast, the Western pattern, characterized by intakes of 
refined grains, white potatoes, red and processed meats, and high-fat dairy, was not associated 
with telomere length in any of these studies. Other studies of leukocyte telomere length have 
examined diet quality indices using evidence-based dietary guidelines. Two studies have 
observed positive associations between high adherence to the Mediterranean diet and telomere 
length, including a small study of elderly adults in Italy (16), and a large study of female nurses 
in the US (13). 
To date, the Mediterranean diet and other diet quality scores have been frequently studied 
in relation to risk of major chronic disease (17-20). However, only one study has compared 
multiple diet quality indices to telomere length in the same study (13). Thus, the objective of this 
study was to examine the associations of diet quality scores and leukocyte telomere length in a 
large and nationally representative sample of healthy men and women. Four evidence-based diet 
scores were examined: the Healthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010, the Alternate Healthy Eating Index 
(AHEI)-2010, the Mediterranean Diet (MedDiet) score, and the Dietary Approaches for Stopping

Hypertension (DASH) index score. We hypothesized that healthful diet quality, as determined by 
each of these measures, would be positively associated with leukocyte telomere length.  
 
 
METHODS 
 
Study population 
The National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) is an ongoing, 
multistage survey representative of the civilian, noninstitutionalized US population, administered 
by the National Center for Health Statistics. The analytic population was comprised of 4,758 
healthy adults, aged 20 to 65 years, who had complete dietary and leukocyte telomere length 
(LTL) data measured in 1999-2002 NHANES. The NHANES response rates for these years 
ranged from 69 to 81%. Adults with a prior diagnosis of coronary heart disease, angina, 
myocardial infarction, stroke, diabetes, congestive heart failure, and cancer were excluded 
(n=826), as these conditions are known to influence both health behaviors and telomere length.  
 
Dietary assessment 
 
Dietary intake was assessed using a single 24-hour dietary recall in the Mobile 
Examination Center (21). Individuals without dietary data (n=214) or implausible total energy 
intakes (<500 or >5000 kcal/day) (n=134) were excluded from analysis. Data from the USDA 
MyPyramid Equivalents Database Version 1.0 and the NHANES dietary interview files were 
used to calculate all diet pattern scores. The validity of the 24-hour recall method has been 
previously discussed (22, 23).

For all diet quality indices, higher scores indicate a more healthful diet pattern. The HEI-
2010 is a measure of diet quality that assesses adherence to the 2010 Dietary Guidelines for 
Americans, developed by the US Department of Agriculture Center for Nutrition Policy and 
Promotion. It is scored out of 100 points, and assesses the following components: total fruit, 
whole fruit, total vegetables, greens and beans, whole grains, dairy, total protein foods, seafood 
and plant proteins, fatty acids, refined grains, sodium, and empty calories (24). Higher scores on 
components reflect higher intakes, with the exceptions of refined grains, sodium, and empty 
calories. The AHEI-2010 was developed at the Harvard School of Public Health, as a measure of 
diet quality inversely related to chronic disease risk (17). It is scored out of 110 points. 
Maximum scores are awarded for high intakes of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, nuts and 
legumes, long-chain fats, and polyunsaturated fats; moderate alcohol intake; and minimal intakes 
of sugar-sweetened beverages and fruit juice, red/processed meats, trans fat, and sodium. In the 
current analysis, the AHEI-2010 was modified by excluding trans fat, which was unavailable in 
NHANES, and the overall score was rescaled to the original total. The MedDiet score measures 
adherence to the traditional Mediterranean diet and was adapted for the US diet (25). Out of 55 
points, scores are awarded for high consumption of whole grains, fruits, vegetables, potatoes, 
legumes, fish, and monounsaturated fats; moderate consumption of alcohol; and low 
consumption of red meat, poultry, and full-fat dairy products. The MedDiet was originally 
developed for a Greek population, but has been previously examined in studies of US adults (26-
28). The DASH score is a diet pattern associated with improved blood pressure in healthy and 
hypertensive adults (29). It includes components for fruits, vegetables, nuts and legumes, whole 
grains, low-fat dairy, sodium, red and processed meats, and sugary beverages, and is scored out 
of 40 points. Higher intakes on all components, except for sodium, red and processed meats, and

sugary beverages, were awarded higher scores. While scoring for the HEI-2010, AHEI-2010, and 
MedDiet scores are based on concrete guidelines, scoring for the DASH score is based on 
relative distributions from the analytic sample. In this analysis, sex-specific cutpoints were 
derived from the study population to estimate each of the DASH components.  
 
Leukocyte telomere length 
 
Leukocyte telomere length (LTL) was assayed from DNA samples purified from whole 
blood, collected from adult NHANES participants in the 1999 to 2002 waves. LTL was assayed 
using the quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method to measure telomere length 
relative to standard reference DNA (T/S ratio) at the University of California, San Francisco 
(30). Procedures were taken to exclude outliers (<2% of samples) and ensure validity of the 
assays. Details of the procedures have been described elsewhere (31). The inter-assay coefficient 
of variation was 6.5%.   
 
Covariate assessment 
Sociodemographic characteristics included in multivariate models included participant’s 
age (in 5-year increments), sex, self-reported race/ethnicity, highest educational attainment, ratio 
of family income to poverty (FPL), and marital status. Health-related variables included alcohol 
consumption (non-drinker, moderate drinker: ≤1 drink/day for women or ≤2 drinks/day for men, 
heavy drinker: >1 drink/day for women or >2 drinks/day for men), smoking status, pack years of 
smoking, physical activity, self-reported change in physical activity over the past year, and total 
energy intake (log-transformed). Anthropometric measures of adiposity included body mass 
index (BMI) and waist circumference. Height, weight and waist circumference were measured

by trained personnel in the Mobile Examination Center. BMI categories were defined as 
underweight (BMI <18.5 kg/m2), normal weight (BMI = 18.5-24.9 kg/m2), overweight (BMI = 
25.0-29.9 kg/m2) and obese (BMI ≥30.0 kg/m2). Elevated waist circumference was defined as 
≥102 cm for men ≥88 cm for women.  
Missing indicators were used to account for missing educational attainment (n=6), family 
income (n=373), marital status (n=239), alcohol consumption (n=7), physical activity (n=3), 
smoking status (n=7), BMI (n=56), and waist circumference (n=82). A complete-case analysis 
was also conducted as a sensitivity analysis.  
 
Statistical analysis 
NHANES complex survey weights were used to account for unequal selection probabilities, 
patterns of non-response, and to make nationally representative estimates (32). All analyses 
incorporated the 4-year dietary survey weights for the 1999-2002 period. As the four diet quality 
indices contained similar components, correlations between the indices were estimated using 
Pearson correlation coefficients. LTL was skewed and log-transformed prior to analysis. The 
first set of analyses examined quintiles of diet pattern indices in relation to LTL, in order to 
allow for non-linear associations. Tests for linear trend were conducted by including the 
midpoint of each quintile of diet quality index as a trend variable. The second set of analyses 
examined standardized diet quality indices in relation to LTL, to allow a more appropriate 
comparison across the four scores. Separate models were examined for men and women in the 
analyses. Heterogeneity by sex was determined using a Wald test of the cross-product term 
between sex and diet quality indices. All models adjusted for sociodemographic and health 
characteristics. Further adjustment for BMI and waist circumference was conducted as a

sensitivity analysis, as these anthropometric measures of adiposity could serve as mediators 
rather than confounders. Supplemental analyses were conducted by examining individual 
components of diet quality indices in relation to telomere length.   
The conversion from the T/S ratio to base pairs was calculated based on comparison of 
telomeric restriction fragment length from Southern blot analysis and T/S ratios using DNA 
samples from the human diploid fibroblast cell line IMR90 at different population doublings. 
The formula used to convert the T/S ratio to base pairs was 3274 + 2413*(T/S).  
 
All statistical tests were 2-sided, and statistical significance was considered at P<0.05. 
Statistical analyses were performed using SAS 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). 
 
RESULTS 
 
In the analytic sample, the mean HEI-2010 score was 46.3 out of 100; the mean AHEI-
2010 score was 37.0 out of 110; the mean MedDiet score was 21.0 out of 55; and the mean 
DASH score was 23.9 out of 40. Pearson correlation coefficients between the four dietary 
patterns ranged from 0.56 to 0.73, with the lowest correlation between HEI-2010 and MedDiet, 
and the highest correlation between AHEI-2010 and DASH. Sociodemographic and health 
characteristics of the study participants are shown in Table 1. In bivariate analyses, being of 
Hispanic ethnicity, higher educational attainment, being married or living with a partner, higher 
household income, moderate alcohol intake, and being a former smoker were positively 
associated with higher mean scores on all four diet patterns.  
 
Associations between quintiles of diet quality scores and log-transformed telomere length 
are shown in Table 2. Among women, a comparison of the top and bottom quintiles showed that 
higher HEI-2010 scores (β=0.065, 95% CI 0.018, 0.112, P-trend=0.007), AHEI-2010 scores

(β=0.054, 95% CI 0.010, 0.097, P-trend=0.007), MedDiet scores (β=0.058, 95% CI 0.017, 
0.098, P-trend=0.008), and DASH scores (β=0.052, 95% CI 0.014, 0.090, P-trend=0.007) were 
each significantly associated with longer LTL, after adjustment for sociodemographic and health 
characteristics (Figure 1). Among men, there were no significant associations when comparing 
the top and bottom quintiles of any diet quality scores to LTL, though there was marginal 
evidence of a linear trend with DASH scores and longer LTL (P-trend=0.06).  
  
We further examined diet quality Z scores in relation to log-transformed telomere length 
in Table 3. Among women, a one-SD increase in HEI-2010 scores (B=0.024, 95% CI 0.008, 
0.039), AHEI-2010 scores (B=0.019, 95% CI 0.007, 0.031), MedDiet scores (B=0.020, 95% CI 
0.008, 0.033), and DASH scores (B=0.019, 95% CI 0.003, 0.035) were each associated with 
longer LTL. Further inclusion of BMI and waist circumference in these models did not change 
these effect estimates and results obtained from the missing indicator method for missing data 
were identical to those from the complete-case analysis (data not shown). When pairs of HEI-
2010, AHEI-2010, MedDiet, and DASH Z scores were included in the models together, 
estimates were attenuated (data not shown). No diet quality Z scores were associated with LTL 
among men. Using the age-associated rate of telomere shortening of 14.6 base pairs per year in 
this sample, a one-standard deviation increase in the HEI-2010 score corresponded to 3.9 
additional years of aging; the AHEI-2010 score to 3.2 additional years of aging; the MedDiet 
score to 3.3 additional years of aging; and the DASH score to 3.2 additional years of aging.  
 
Individual components of the HEI-2010 and MedDiet scores were examined in relation to 
log-transformed leukocyte telomere length (Web Tables 1-2). The HEI-2010 and MedDiet were 
selected for these analyses because their associations with LTL were largest in magnitude for 
women. For the HEI-2010 score, a higher empty calories score (reflecting lower empty calories

consumption) was associated with longer LTL in women. For the MedDiet score, whole-fat dairy 
and alcohol scores (reflecting lower whole-fat dairy and moderate alcohol consumption) were 
associated with longer LTL in women.  
 
DISCUSSION 
 
In this national sample of 4,758 healthy, nonelderly adults, we examined four evidence-
based diet quality indices in relation to LTL. Our results showed that HEI-2010, AHEI-2010, 
MedDiet, and DASH scores were each positively associated with LTL in women, roughly 
equivalent to 3.2 to 3.9 additional years of aging for every one-standard deviation higher score 
on these diet quality indices. The magnitudes of these associations are comparable to other 
studies of dietary intake and cellular aging, 4.5 additional years for a 33% increase in the 
Alternate Mediterranean Diet score (13), 4 fewer years for processed meat intake (33), and 4.6 
fewer years of aging for consuming a 20-ounce bottle of sugared soda (34). These magnitudes 
are also similar to analyses of other lifestyle behaviors and cellular aging, such as smoking (4.6 
fewer years) (5). and physical activity (4.4 additional years) (4). When pairs of indices were 
examined together in the same model, the effect sizes were attenuated, indicating their 
associations were not different from each other. These results corroborate a prior study that 
found positive associations between adherence to the Mediterranean diet and to a lesser extent, 
the AHEI-2010, with longer telomere length in U.S. women (13).  
When individual components of the diet quality indices were examined, only one 
component of the HEI-2010 score, empty calories, was associated with LTL in women. This 
suggests that there may be synergistic effects of the other dietary components driving the 
positive association between HEI-2010 scores and LTL. For the MedDiet score, lower whole-fat

12 
dairy intake and moderate alcohol consumption were both associated with LTL, which suggests 
these components may be driving the positive association between MedDiet score and LTL. 
However, we caution against placing too much focus on one individual dietary component in this 
analysis, as examining foods in isolation could potentially ignore the synergistic effects of foods 
commonly consumed together. Overall, our findings suggest that the protective associations with 
LTL extend to a general healthful diet pattern high in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, dairy 
products, and plant-based proteins, and low in red and processed meats, sodium, and added 
sugars, and that consuming these foods in combination is related to healthy cellular aging among 
women. 
High scores on the HEI-2010, AHEI-2010, Mediterranean Diet, and DASH scores have 
been consistently shown to reduce the risk of major chronic disease, including type 2 diabetes 
(17, 19, 35), cardiovascular disease (17), cancers (17), and all-cause, cardiovascular disease, and 
cancer mortality (18). The fact that these four evidence-based diet quality indices are all 
predictive of lower chronic disease risk may be expected given their shared components; 
however, the correlations between scores in the present study ranged from 0.56 to 0.73. Other 
qualitative differences between the four indices include that the HEI-2010 awards points for 
consuming any types of protein, including red and processed meats, whereas the others prioritize 
plant-based protein sources (e.g. nuts, legumes) and fish. The HEI-2010 also awards points for 
consuming any dairy product, but full-fat dairy is penalized in the MedDiet score and only low-
fat dairy is awarded points in the DASH score. In contrast, the AHEI-2010 and MedDiet are the 
only patterns to award points for moderate alcohol consumption. Regardless of these differences, 
high scores on all diet quality indices were associated with longer LTL in women, suggesting

that telomere length maintenance may represent an additional mechanism by which high diet 
quality is protective for major chronic disease and mortality in women (20). 
 
The relations between multiple healthful diet quality indices and telomere length was 
significantly different between men and women. Although the mechanisms underlying the 
associations between diet and LTL are unknown, the differential sex-specific associations we 
observed agree with findings from other studies. For example, in the PREDIMED-NAVARRA 
trial, García-Calzón and colleagues observed a positive association between baseline 
Mediterranean diet adherence and basal telomere length in women, but not in men (36). In a 
cohort of older Finnish adults, Tiainen and colleagues found that vegetable intake was positively 
associated with LTL in women, while fruit intake was inversely associated with LTL in men 
(37). Lastly, in a sample of Chinese women, an empirically derived high vegetable dietary 
pattern was associated with longer LTL in women but not men, and this relationship as partly 
mediated by C-reactive protein (inflammation) (38). Telomere length is impacted by 
inflammation, insulin resistance, and oxidative stress (39-41), all of which can be affected by 
specific dietary behaviors. In fact, another study using the same data set found that a pro-
inflammatory diet was significantly associated with shorter LTL (42). In the present study, men 
consumed higher levels of red and processed meats and sugar-sweetened beverages across 
quartiles of LTL (data not shown) – these are all foods known to induce inflammation, insulin 
resistance, and oxidative stress. The more prevalent consumption of these specific foods may 
largely negate the beneficial properties of an otherwise healthful diet quality on LTL in men.  
 
 
Our study was strengthened by the use of a large, nationally representative sample of 
adults, the availability of information on a large number of sociodemographic and health 
characteristics that allows for careful adjustments for potential confounding, and high response

14 
rates, which improves the generalizability of our findings. However, this study also has 
limitations. This primary limitation is the cross-sectional nature of the data, which prevents us 
from making causal inferences about our findings. To date, the majority of epidemiologic studies 
examining diet and telomere length have relied on cross-sectional data, even those embedded in 
prospective cohort studies. This highlights the need for longitudinal studies, with repeated 
concurrent measures of dietary intake and telomere length over time, to better understand how 
dietary changes influence telomere length. Furthermore, dietary intake was assessed using one 
24-hour dietary recall. A single 24-hour dietary recall may not approximate usual dietary intake 
due to day-to-day variation, and future studies with more robust methods of dietary assessment 
are needed to confirm these findings.  
 
In conclusion, the results of this large and nationally representative study suggest that a 
diet high in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, dairy products, and plant-based proteins, and low in 
red and processed meats, sodium, and added sugars is related to healthy cellular aging, 
particularly among women. Although further research is still needed to understand how dietary 
intake and diet patterns relate to cellular aging among men, efforts to promote longevity and 
reduce chronic disease risk through optimal nutrition should focus on improving overall diet 
quality rather than emphasizing individual foods or nutrients.
