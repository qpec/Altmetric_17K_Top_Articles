SUMMARY
Several studies have reported reprogramming of
fibroblasts into induced cardiomyocytes; however,
reprogramming into proliferative induced cardiac
progenitor cells (iCPCs) remains to be accomplished.
Here we report that a combination of 11 or 5 cardiac
factors along with canonical Wnt and JAK/STAT
signaling reprogrammed adult mouse cardiac, lung,
and tail tip fibroblasts into iCPCs. The iCPCs were
cardiac mesoderm-restricted progenitors that could
be expanded extensively while maintaining multipo-
tency to differentiate into cardiomyocytes, smooth
muscle cells, and endothelial cells in vitro. Moreover,
iCPCs injected into the cardiac crescent of mouse
embryos differentiated into cardiomyocytes. iCPCs
transplanted into the post-myocardial infarction
mouse heart improved survival and differentiated
into cardiomyocytes, smooth muscle cells, and
endothelial cells. Lineage reprogramming of adult
somatic cells into iCPCs provides a scalable cell
source for drug discovery, disease modeling, and
cardiac regenerative therapy.
INTRODUCTION
The advent of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) has revived
interest in earlier research showing that stable transdifferentia-
tion of somatic cells is possible by forced expression of defined
factors (Davis et al., 1987). Previous studies have reported line-
age reprogramming into a diverse range of differentiated cells
types, including neurons (Vierbuchen et al., 2010), hepatocytes
(Sekiya and Suzuki, 2011), and cardiomyocytes (CMs) (Ieda
et al., 2010; Song et al., 2012). More recently, lineage reprog-
ramming into tissue-specific progenitors has been achieved,
including neural (Han et al., 2012) and hepatic progenitor cells
(Yu et al., 2013). Using transdifferentiation to produce progenitor
cells rather than terminally differentiated cell types provides po-
tential advantages for both drug discovery and regenerative
medicine applications. Reprogrammed progenitors are prolifer-
ative and, therefore, more scalable. Lineage-restricted induced
progenitor cells may be superior for therapeutic applications
because of their ability to proliferate and differentiate into the
needed complement of cell types required to fully reconstitute
the diseased or damaged tissue. Induced progenitor cells may
also provide a more efficient and reproducible platform to obtain
tissue-specific terminally differentiated cell types compared with
pluripotent stem cells (PSCs).
Cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs) have been identified using
various markers in the developing and adult heart. During
embryogenesis, CPCs of both first and second heart fields
reside in the cardiac crescent. Several studies have isolated
CPCs from embryos and embryonic stem cells (ESCs) using
transcription factor (TF)-based reporters like Mesp1, Isl1, and
Nkx2.5, but a master regulator of the CPC state has not yet
been identified (Bondue et al., 2011; Masino et al., 2004; Moretti
et al., 2006). Cell surface markers, including Cxcr4, Pdgfr-a,
Flk1/KDR, and SIRPA, have been used to identify PSC-derived
CPCs. (Dubois et al., 2011; Kattman et al., 2011). CPCs have
354

 also been identified in the adult mammalian heart using markers,
including Sca1 and cKit, that, in small animal studies, have
demonstrated multi-lineage potency following transplantation
to the post-myocardial infarction (MI) myocardium (Ellison
et al., 2013; Oh et al., 2003). However, in vitro multi-lineage dif-
ferentiation of adult CPCs has been difficult to demonstrate,
especially with regard to differentiation into contracting cardio-
myocytes (Noseda et al., 2015), and the regenerative capacity
of adult c-kit+ CPCs after cardiac injury has been questioned
(van Berlo et al., 2014).
Reprogramming to a stem or progenitor cell state requires
knowledge of a specific combination of master regulatory fac-
tors as well as appropriate culture conditions that can maintain
self-renewal and multipotency. Typically, the culture conditions
for reprogramming mimic those optimized for the in vitro culture
of native stem cells based on both empiric optimization and
knowledge of developmental signaling pathways. For example,
in the case of iPSCs, the distinct culture conditions optimized
for mouse and human ESC culture were utilized to generate
mouse and human iPSCs, respectively (Takahashi and Yama-
naka, 2006; Yu et al., 2007). Likewise, reprogramming to induced
neural stem cells employed standard adult neural stem cell me-
dium (Han et al., 2012). In contrast to commonly used neural
stem cell medium, variable culture conditions have been used
for adult heart-derived CPCs (Ellison et al., 2013; Oh et al.,
2003). It has also proven difficult to generate culture conditions
and appropriate signaling to maintain and expand embryonic
or PSC-derived CPCs. Recently, mesodermal SSEA1 progeni-
tors with robust cardiac differentiation potential have been main-
tained (Cao et al., 2013), but to generate and maintain human
PSC-derived, cardiac-restricted progenitors has required trans-
genic forced expression of an oncogene, c-Myc (Birket et al.,
2015). Therefore, the lack of clearly defined culture conditions
for the maintenance and expansion of both adult and PSC-
derived CPCs has increased the challenge in transdifferentiating
cells into CPCs and likely contributes to the limited success to
date in converting fibroblasts into proliferative and multipotent
CPCs (Islas et al., 2012).
Here we show that a defined set of cardiac factors comple-
mented by appropriate culture conditions can reprogram adult
mouse fibroblasts from three different tissues into iCPCs. iCPCs
were
stably
reprogrammed,
cardiac
mesoderm-restricted,
clonal progenitors that could be passaged extensively and
showed multipotency toward cardiovascular lineages (CMs,
smooth muscle cells [SMs], and endothelial cells [ECs]) in vitro
and following transplantation to the embryonic cardiac crescent
or the adult post-myocardial infarction heart. Cardiac progenitor
reprogramming technology holds promise as a scalable cell
source for drug discovery, disease modeling, and cardiac regen-
erative therapy.
RESULTS
Screening for Cardiac Progenitor Cell-Inducing Factors
Based on the known expression pattern of genes that are critical
during embryonic cardiovascular development, we selected
18 candidate genes to test their reprogramming ability. These
included cardiac transcription factors and cardiac chromatin re-
modeling factors. We also included iPSC factors, reasoning that
they may facilitate reprogramming. These 22 genes were cloned
individually into a doxycycline (dox)-inducible lentivirus vector,
generating an expression library of defined factors (Figure S1A).
Dox-induced expression of the factors was confirmed at the
mRNA and protein levels in transduced fibroblasts (Figures
S1B–S1D; Supplemental Experimental Procedures).
We utilized an Nkx2.5 cardiac reporter mouse model express-
ing enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP) in the developing
heart during the initial stages of cardiac development (embryonic
day [E] 7.75–E 10.5) (Masino et al., 2004). The developmentally
restricted Nkx2.5-EYFP reporter identifies early CPCs, but it is
inactive during later stages of cardiac development (E11 onward)
and in the adult heart. The Nkx2.5-EYFP mouse was crossed
with a transgenic mouse expressing a reverse tetracycline trans-
activator (rtTA) to enable dox-inducible transgene expression.
Cardiac fibroblasts were isolated from adult double-transgenic
(Nkx2.5-EYFP/rtTA) mice by explant culture (Figure 1A; Fig-
ure S1E). Immunostaining of the isolated fibroblasts with
markers of CPCs (Irx4, Nkx2.5, and Gata4) as well as cardiac
lineage cells such as CMs (a-actinin and a-myosin heavy chain
[a-MHC]), SMs (SM-MHC), and ECs (CD31) revealed no staining
(Figures S1F–S1J).
Uninfected adult cardiac fibroblasts (AC Fibs) did not express
EYFP and senesced after three to four passages (psgs) (Fig-
ure S2A). As a first test of the dox-inducible library for reprogram-
ming, AC Fibs were infected with iPSC factors. Dox treatment
produced proliferative cells that formed EYFP- iPSC colonies
(Figure S2B). Next, we tested infection of AC Fibs with induced
CM (iCM) factors (Gata4, Mef2c, Tbx5 [GMT]), but even after
extended dox induction (6 weeks), we did not observe contract-
ing cells or EYFP+ cells. However, neonatal cardiac fibroblasts
infected with iCM factors reprogrammed into spontaneously
contracting, EYFP� iCMs after 4 weeks of dox treatment (Fig-
ure S2C; Movie S1). These results demonstrate dox-inducible re-
programming with the described vector system. Furthermore,
the Nkx2.5-EYFP reporter is not activated during iPSC or iCM
reprogramming.
Infection of AC Fibs with a mixture of lentiviruses containing all
22 factors resulted in a small number of EYFP+ proliferative col-
onies only after dox treatment (Figure S2D). Next, we subtracted
iPSC factors from the 22-factor library and infected fibroblasts
with 18 cardiac factors. Proliferative EYFP+ cells were again
observed 3 weeks after dox treatment (Figure S2D). Reasoning
that factors expressed early in cardiac development might
have the highest potential to reprogram fibroblasts into iCPCs,
we chose 11 early cardiac factors (Mesp1, Mesp2, Gata4,
Gata6, Baf60c, SRF, Isl1, Nkx2.5, Irx4, Tbx5, and Tbx20) to infect
AC Fibs. Infection with 11 factors gave rise to proliferative EYFP+
cells only after dox treatment (Figure 1B).
We analyzed the time course of appearance of EYFP+ cells
upon infection with the 11 factors. Single EYFP+ cells were de-
tected as early as day 4 after dox treatment. By 3 weeks, these
EYFP+ cells developed into two-dimensional, highly proliferative
colonies of EYFP+ cells that lost their parental fibroblast
morphology and exhibited a high nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio (Fig-
ure S2E). Infection with 11 factors reproducibly gave rise to
EYFP+ proliferative colonies (4 colonies/50,000 cells; efficiency,
0.008%) (Figures 1C and 1D). We manually isolated these EYFP+
colonies and tried to expand them by splitting. However,

 the cells lost EYFP expression and senesced after three to
five psgs under the ‘‘dox only’’ culture condition (Figure 1E;
Figure S2F).
Wnt and JAK/STAT Signaling Promotes Proliferative
Reprogrammed Cells
The overexpression of cardiac factors alone, even though suffi-
cient to produce EYFP+ colonies, was insufficient for maintaining
EYFP+ cells in a proliferative, reprogrammed state, indicating
that additional signaling cues might be necessary. Canonical
Wnt signaling is critical for proliferation of CPCs (Cao et al.,
2013; Qyang et al., 2007), and JAK/STAT signaling is important
for normal cardiogenesis (Foshay et al., 2005). Therefore, we
tested the effect of supplementing the reprogramming medium
with 6-bromoindirubin-30-oxime (BIO, a canonical Wnt activator)
and/or LIF (a JAK/STAT activator) on reprogramming efficiency
as well as the ability of EYFP+ cells to maintain a proliferative
state (Figure 1C). Surprisingly, addition of LIF alone inhibited
the generation of EYFP+ cells and colony formation. Addition
of BIO alone resulted in a similar reprogramming efficiency as
dox only. However, the EYFP+ cells became spindle-like upon
passaging and were not highly proliferative. The LIF+BIO combi-
nation produced the brightest EYFP+ cells, and the EYFP+ cells
were robustly expandable (Figures 1C–1E; Figures S2F–S2H).
Therefore, both LIF and BIO were included in our reprogramming
medium, ‘‘iCPC induction medium.’’ Eleven-factor infection fol-
lowed by culture in iCPC induction medium produced six to
nine EYFP+ colonies (per 50,000 starting cells; 0.013% reprog-
ramming efficiency) that could be expanded continuously on
splitting (F11 iCPCs). To determine whether LIF+BIO was neces-
sary for initial reprogramming, we tested whether EYFP+ col-
onies generated by the dox only condition could be expanded
by addition of LIF+BIO later during passaging. We observed
that addition of LIF+BIO starting at psg 1 allowed for robust
expansion of dox only EYFP+ cells, indicating that the effect of
LIF+BIO was more on the maintenance of the reprogrammed
state than on initiation of reprogramming.
To determine whether continued forced expression of cardiac
factors was required to maintain the iCPC state, we withdrew
dox from the iCPC induction medium (iCPC maintenance me-
dium) after two psgs and assessed whether EYFP+ cells re-
mained proliferative. Cells maintained EYFP expression as well
as their proliferative ability for over 30 psgs (Figure 1F). The
EYFP+ cells continued to reduce in size during the initial psgs un-
til psg 2–3, when they reached a steady state, after which their
morphology remained unchanged during further passaging.
Next, we determined the population doubling time of iCPCs
that had been passaged in iCPC maintenance medium for 10
and 20 psgs. Both psg 10 and 20 iCPCs had a similar population
doubling time of about 30 hr, which was significantly less than
AC Fibs (Figure 1G). These results suggest that iCPCs were sta-
bly reprogrammed and maintained their proliferative state in the
presence of LIF+BIO and without exogenous induction of car-
diac factors by dox.
Five Factors Are Sufficient to Reprogram Adult Cardiac
Fibroblasts into iCPCs
We wanted to determine whether iCPCs could be reprog-
rammed using a subset of the 11 factors. Initially, we tested a
core combination of three factors (within the 11-factor combina-
tion) that are expressed earliest in cardiac development: Mesp1,
Tbx5, and Gata4 (MTG). We infected AC Fibs with MTG and
cultured them in iCPC induction medium, but we did not observe
emergence of any EYFP+ colonies for up to 4 weeks. Therefore,
we tested whether addition of remaining factors within the
11-factor pool to MTG can induce colony formation. Addition
of Baf60c, Isl1, and Nkx2.5 to MTG reproducibly generated
EYFP+ colonies after 3 weeks (Figure 2A; Figure S2I). Although
the four-factor combinations produced EYFP+ cells, their prolif-
erative ability as well as EYFP expression declined progressively
with subsequent passaging in iCPC maintenance medium. This
suggested that four-factor combinations induced partial reprog-
ramming and were insufficient to epigenetically stabilize cells in
the iCPC state. Because MTG+Nkx2.5 (MTGN) produced the
most colonies, we tested whether addition of the other factors
that produced colonies in the four-factor combination, Baf60c
or Isl1, to MTGN could facilitate stable reprogramming into
iCPCs (Figure 2A; Figure S2J). Addition of both Baf60c and Isl1
to MTGN produced proliferative colonies, but Baf60c+MTGN
(MTGNB) produced the most expandable colonies post-dox
withdrawal and, therefore, was selected for further characteriza-
tion. Infection with MTGNB (factor 5 [F5]) reproducibly gave rise
to expandable F5 iCPCs (�7.25 colonies/50,000 cells) (Figure 2B)
that could be expanded stably in iCPC maintenance medium
(without dox) for at least 20 psgs (Figure S3A). Three F5 iCPC
lines underwent karyotype analysis, which demonstrated that
two of three lines exhibited normal karyotypes, whereas the third
line had numerical and structural abnormalities (Figure S3B).
These results suggest that five factors stably reprogrammed
AC Fibs into proliferative iCPCs.
Cardiac Factors Stably Reprogram Adult Cardiac
Fibroblasts into Cardiac Mesoderm-Restricted iCPCs
To analyze iCPC gene expression, we performed qPCR analysis
on psg 1 iCPCs that revealed upregulation of key CPC transcrip-
tion factors, including Nkx2.5, Tbx5, Mef2c, Mesp1, Tbx20, and

 Irx4, accompanied by downregulation of the fibroblast-specific
gene Fsp1 (Figure 2C). These results indicate that iCPCs initiated
the cardiac program at the expense of the fibroblast program, a
hallmark of lineage reprogramming. Next, we performed immu-
nostaining for CPC-related TFs. In contrast to AC Fibs, which
did not immunolabel for Nkx2.5, Gata4, or Irx4 (Figure S1F),
iCPCs exhibited nuclear localization of these TFs that remained
constant across psgs 5–25 (Figures 2D, S3C, and S4A–C). Flow
cytometry demonstrated that greater than 80% of the iCPC ex-
pressed Nkx2.5, Gata4, and Irx4 (Figure 2E). Furthermore, we
assessed whether iCPCs expressed cell surface markers asso-
ciated with CPCs (Kattman et al., 2011; Nelson et al., 2008).
Flow cytometry analysis revealed that iCPCs homogenously ex-
pressed Cxcr4. However, only a fraction of iCPCs expressed
Flk1, Pdgfr-a, or cKit (Figure 2F; Figure S3D). We found no pro-
tein expression for pluripotency (Oct4) or cardiac lineage differ-
entiation markers (a-actinin, SM-MHC, and CD31), even after
extensive passaging (Figure S4F). Comparable results were
observed for these experiments whether F11 or F5 iCPCs were
used.
To characterize the transcriptome of iCPCs, we performed
RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis on early-psg (1–3) as well
as late-psg (8–10) iCPCs. As a positive control, we utilized
gene expression values for a mouse ESC (mESC)-derived CPC
population described previously by Wamstad et al. (2012), and
the gene expression was compared with uninfected AC Fibs.
We found that genes involved in cardiovascular development,
including TFs (Tbx3, Hes1, Prrx1, Foxa2, Gata4/6, Meis1, and
Gli2), signaling molecules (LIF, Vegfc, Grem1, and Fgf2), cell sur-
face markers (cKit, Pdgfr-a, Notch1, and Gpc3), and chromatin
remodeling genes (Smarcd3, Hdac 2/5/7/10, and Jarid2) were
increasingly upregulated as iCPCs were passaged (Figure 3A).
In contrast, fibroblast-specific genes (Postn, Twist2, and Thy1)
were increasingly downregulated with passaging (Figure 3B).
Furthermore, CM differentiation markers (Actc1, Myh6, Myl2,
and Myl7) were not expressed in iCPCs. Interestingly, genes
associated with SM (Cnn1 and Myh11) and EC (Pecam1) were
upregulated in one early-psg replicate. However, these genes
were downregulated in late-psg iCPCs. Primitive streak genes
(Gsc, Mixl1, and T) were not detected (Figure S4D). Likewise,
progenitor genes for endoderm, ectoderm, and non-cardiac
mesoderm were not expressed by iCPCs (Figure S4E). mESC-
CPCs used by Wamstad et al. (2012) were derived from the
whole population of cells after 5 days of differentiation. This pop-
ulation was highly enriched for CPCs but potentially contained a
minority of cells from non-cardiac lineages. Therefore, mESC-
CPC samples had higher expression for some endoderm, ecto-
derm, and non-cardiac mesoderm markers. Additionally, Bmp
(4/6/7) genes that induce cardiac differentiation were also down-
regulated. Importantly, iCPCs did not express markers of plurip-
otent stem cells (Pou5f1, Esrrb, Dppa2/3, Lin28a, and Sox2)
(Figure S4D). However, we did observe upregulation of Nanog
(see Discussion). A pairwise Pearson’s correlation analysis of
all expressed genes revealed that transcription profiles of both
low- and high-psg iCPCs have higher correlation with mESC-
CPCs compared with mESC-CMs (Wamstad et al., 2012) (Fig-
ure 3C). Gene ontology (GO) terms associated with upregulated
genes in iCPCs include categories such as ‘‘positive regulation
of cell proliferation,’’ ‘‘negative regulation of cell differentiation,’’
and ‘‘cardiovascular system development,’’ whereas terms
associated with the downregulated genes include categories
such as ‘‘cell adhesion,’’ ‘‘cell differentiation,’’ and ‘‘apoptosis’’
(Figure 3D). In aggregate, these data suggest that iCPCs are car-
diac mesoderm-restricted precursors.
iCPCs Differentiate into Cardiomyocytes, Smooth
Muscle Cells, and Endothelial Cells
To determine whether iCPCs were capable of differentiation into
cardiovascular lineages, iCPCs were aggregated in cardiac dif-
ferentiation medium. iCPCs maintained EYFP expression in ag-
gregates. However, 20 days after plating, cells lost EYFP expres-
sion, suggesting that the iCPCs exited the progenitor state and
differentiated (Figures 3E and 3F). Immunocytochemistry re-
vealed differentiated cells expressing CM (cardiac actin, a-acti-
nin, MLC-2a, MLC-2v, and a/b MHC), SM (SM-MHC), or EC
(CD31) markers (Figure 3G; Figure S3E). Among iCPC-differenti-
ated cells, a majority stained positively for CM markers (80%–
90%), and only a fraction stained for SM (5%–10%) and EC
markers (1%–5%) (Figure 3G; Figure S3F). These results suggest
that iCPCs were multipotent, capable of differentiating into three
types of cardiovascular lineage cells. We evaluated the differen-
tiation potential of psg 5 and 30 iCPCs and observed that
multipotency was comparable across psgs (Figure S5A). The
finding of comparable potency across passages argues against
contaminating cell types in the starting AC Fibs, confounding the
results. Most MLC-2v-positive CMs also labeled for MLC-2a,
indicating that they were relatively immature. However, we did
observe cells that exclusively stained for MLC-2v or MLC-2a
(<5%), suggesting that iCPCs can differentiate into both
atrium-like and ventricle-like CMs (Figures S5B and S5C).
Even after attaining highly organized sarcomeres following
extended culture periods under low-serum conditions, the
iCPC-derived CMs did not exhibit spontaneous contractions.
We reasoned that co-culturing iCPC-CMs with mESC-derived
CMs may provide additional mechanical, electrical, and para-
crine stimulation to induce further maturation and contraction.
Co-culturing with rat CMs has been shown previously to induce
contraction in iCMs (Wada et al., 2013). Therefore, we infected
iCPC-CMs with a constitutive GFP-expressing lentivirus to iden-
tify reprogrammed cells and co-cultured them with mESC-
derived CMs expressing td-tomato. We did not detect cells
that co-expressed both GFP and td-tomato (Figure 4A), suggest-
ing that cell fusion between iCPC-CMs and mESC-CMs was un-
likely. We immunostained the co-cultured cells for CM markers
as well as GFP and noticed that GFP+ iCPC-CMs and GFP�
mESC-CMs both stained positively for CM markers and grew
side by side as monolayers (Figure S5D). Moreover, immuno-
staining for Cx43 revealed that iCPC-CMs developed abundant
gap junctions with both mESC-CMs as well as other iCPC-
CMs (Figure 4B). After 10–14 days of co-culturing, 5%–10% of
iCPC-CMs started contracting synchronously with mESC-CMs
(Movie S2). The contracting iCPC-CMs also showed sponta-
neous calcium transients that were similar to those in mESC-
CMs in frequency and amplitude (Figures 4C and 4D; Figures
S5E and S5F; Movie S3).
We wanted to determine the cardiovascular potency of single-
cell iCPCs. Therefore, iCPCs were seeded at low density and
cultured to obtain single cell-derived colonies that were picked,

 expanded, and, subsequently, differentiated (Figure 4E). We
found that six of nine clones exhibited tripotency (differentiated
into CMs, SMs, and ECs), whereas three of nine clones were bi-
potent (differentiated into CMs and SMs) (Figures 4F and 4G).
This indicates that there is heterogeneity among iCPC clones
regarding cardiac lineage potency.
Cardiac Factors Stably Reprogram Adult Lung and Tail
Tip Fibroblasts into iCPCs
To determine whether iCPCs could be reprogrammed from
non-cardiac sources of fibroblasts, we isolated adult lung
fibroblasts (AL Fibs) and adult tail tip fibroblasts (AT Fibs)
from Nkx2.5-EYFP/rtTA transgenic mice. Both AL Fibs and
AT Fibs stained negatively for CPC TFs as well as cardiac line-
age differentiation markers and had no EYFP expression. We
infected AL Fibs and AT Fibs with either 11 or 5 factors and
cultured them in iCPC induction medium. AL Fibs infected
with 11 factors or 5 factors produced 9 or 10.5 EYFP+ colonies,

for at least 10 psgs, stained positively
for CPC markers, and differentiated into
CMs (50%–60%), SMs (10%–15%), and
ECs (5%–10%) (Figures 5B–5H). Three lung-derived iCPC lines
underwent karyotype analysis, which demonstrated that two of
three lines exhibited normal karyotypes, whereas the third line
was nearly tetraploid (Figure 5G). Similarly, AT Fib-derived
iCPCs could be stably expanded in iCPC maintenance medium
for at least five psgs, stained positively for CPC markers, and
differentiated into CMs (30%–40%), SMs (5%–10%), and ECs
(1%–5%) (Figures 5B–5I).
We generated over 40 iCPC lines from three different fibroblast
sources (AC Fibs, F11 [10 lines] and F5 [20 lines]; AL Fibs, F11
[4 lines] and F5 [4 lines]; and AT Fibs, F11 [2 lines] and F5 [2 lines]).
All iCPC lines had comparable morphologies, EYFP expression,
and proliferation rates. Many of these lines were characterized
extensively for expression of CPC markers (TFs and cell surface
proteins) and cardiac lineage potency at various passages
(ranging from psgs 5–30). It is interesting to note that various
iCPC lines showed a reproducible expression pattern for CPC
markers and possessed cardiac lineage potency regardless of

 factor combination (F11 or F5) and tissue of origin. These results
indicate that adult fibroblasts from diverse tissues of origin can
be reprogrammed reproducibly and stably into proliferative
and multipotent iCPCs.
iCPCs Differentiate into Cardiomyocytes when Injected
into the Cardiac Crescent of Mouse Embryos
After demonstrating iCPC reprogramming from various tissues
of origin and defining their cardiovascular potency in vitro, we
wanted to assess iCPC potency in the developing heart at a stage
when the Nkx2.5-EYFP reporter used to isolate iCPCs would be
expressed. We reasoned that if the iCPCs truly mimic native
CPCs, then they would likewise respond to the rich cardiogenic
signaling environment in the native cardiac crescent (CC) (Abu-
Issa and Kirby, 2007) and differentiate rapidly into cardiomyo-
cytes. iCPCs were first infected with a constitutive GFP-express-
ing lentivirus to track their progeny andthen injectedintothe CC of
mouse conceptus (E7.75, headfold-6 somite pairs stage). We

cultured operated and un-operated con-
trol conceptus in a whole-embryo ex vivo
culture system for 24 or 48 hr. During
this culture period, the CC undergoes
a morphogenic shift to develop into a
beating linear heart tube. Therefore, the
endogenous CPCs contained in the CC
(E7.75) differentiate into contracting CMs
within 24 hr (E8.5).
We injected 200–500 iCPCs per embryo in a total of 20 em-
bryos in two separate experiments and performed live imaging
on injected embryos to determine the location of the GFP+ cells
at the end of 24 and 48 hr of whole-embryo culture. In 3 of 20
embryos, no GFP+ cells were detected, possibly because of
leakage of cells out of the injection site during the injection. In
15 of 17 of the remaining embryos (88%), GFP+ cells localized
exclusively to the developing heart and appeared to contract
along with the endogenous CMs (Figures 6A and 6B; Figure S6E;
Movies S4 and S5). In contrast, AC Fibs injected into the CC were
excluded completely from the developing heart tube. The major-
ity of injected AC Fibs were also excluded from the embryo
proper and localized to the ectoplacental cone (extra-embryonic
region) (Figure 6C; Figures S6A and S6B). The presence of iCPCs
in the heart tube suggests that they were able to respond to car-
diac-morphogenetic signaling in the developing embryo and
localize/differentiate along with host CPCs to the beating heart
tube. To assess whether the iCPC-derived cells could integrate

 with host cells, some of the injected embryos were sectioned
and immunostained with a GFP antibody. We observed that
iCPC-derived cells integrated with host cells within the heart
tube (Figure 6D).
To determine whether injected iCPCs differentiated into CMs
in vivo, whole-mount embryos were co-immunostained for
GFP and CM markers. Specimens were imaged as optical sec-
tions (1 mm) using multi-photon excitation microscopy, and
three-dimensional reconstructions of the z stack images were
taken. In the 24-hr cultured embryos, we detected multiple
GFP+ cells in the heart tube that co-stained for CM markers
such as MLC-2v and cardiac actin. In 24-hr cultured embryo
samples, the iCPC-derived CMs had an elongated appearance
and looked morphologically distinct from the native CMs (Fig-
ure 6E; Movie S6). However, iCPC-derived CMs in the 48-hr
cultured embryos had a rounder morphology and appeared
similar in shape and size to the native CMs (Figure 6F; Figure S6F;
Movie S7). iCPC-CMs were observed in developing atria and

ventricles as well as the outflow track,
showing no spatial preference within the
heart tube. In contrast, injected AC Fibs
failed to differentiate into CMs, as indi-
cated by the absence of staining for CM
markers (Figure S6C and S6D).
Although
we
observed
endothelial
differentiation from iCPCs in vitro, we
were unable to convincingly detect iCPC-derived CD31+ cells
in vivo. Because of the limited endothelial potency of iCPCs
(only 1%–5% detected during in vitro differentiation), we may
have missed rare CD31+ cells within embryos. The whole-em-
bryo culture technique used here cannot be extended beyond
E9.75 because the embryo becomes increasingly dependent
upon formation of a chorio-allantoic placenta and interaction
with its mother (Lawson et al., 1991). Therefore, we were unable
to assay embryos for smooth muscle because the onset of
smooth muscle differentiation is after E10.5 (Miano et al.,
1994), which exceeded our whole-embryo culture duration
(E7.75–E9.75).

Infarction Engraft within the Scar Tissue and
Differentiate into Cardiac Lineage Cells In Vivo
To examine the applicability of the iCPC technology for cardiac
regenerative medicine, we tested the potency of iCPCs in an

 adult heart injury model. To induce myocardial infarction, we
permanently ligated the left coronary artery in 8-week-old
C57BL/6J male mice. Two days post-MI, we injected 1–1.5
million GFP-labeled iCPCs (F5 iCPCs reprogrammed from AC
Fibs) or PBS into the border zone of the infarct and monitored
the animals for 4 weeks. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed
that 75% of the animals that received an iCPC injection survived
to 4 weeks, which was significantly higher compared with 11% of
mice that survived after PBS injection (Figure 7A). To determine
whether injected iCPCs could differentiate into cardiac lineage
cells, we harvested the hearts of injected animals and performed
immunohistochemistry on tissue sections with cardiac lineage
differentiation markers and GFP. We first analyzed the hearts
of animals 4 days after iCPC injection. A majority of surviving
iCPCs were localized at the border of the infarct zone and
showed faint expression of cardiac actin (Figure 7B). This sug-
gested that some iCPCs were differentiating into CMs. When
we analyzed the hearts of animals 28 days after injection, we

noticed that some iCPC-derived cells
migrated and engrafted more than 1 mm
deep within the scar tissue (Figure 7C;
Figure S7A). Moreover, the iCPC-derived
cells exhibited strong expression of car-
diac actin, indicating their differentiation
into CMs. Even though iCPC-derived
CMs did not completely resemble host
CMs in morphology, they showed orga-
nized cardiac actin staining (Figure 7C;
Figure S7A). Some iCPCs-CMs attained
a rod-shaped morphology and appeared to be highly aligned,
a characteristic of adult CMs (Figure 7D; Figure S7A). The inten-
sity of cardiac actin staining in iCPC-derived CMs (yellow arrow)
is comparable with that in host CMs (red arrow), suggesting that
iCPCs had differentiated into functional CMs when assessed
28 days after injection. Some of the injected iCPCs differentiated
into smooth muscle cells (Figure 7E; Figure S7B) and endothelial
cells (Figure 7F; Figure S7C), as indicated by expression of
smooth muscle actin and CD31, respectively. During the
4-week time course of the study, we did not observe any tumor
formation. These data indicate that iCPCs can survive, engraft,
and differentiate into cardiac lineage cells in the post-MI heart
and improve survival in treated mice.

 or 5 (Mesp1, Tbx5, Gata4, Nkx2.5, and Baf60c) cardiac factors, in
conjunction with Wnt and JAK/STAT signaling, can stably repro-
gram adult fibroblasts from three different tissue origins into pro-
liferative and multipotent iCPCs. We screened defined factors
and culture conditions to induce reprogramming based on two
criteria: the capability to activate the Nkx2.5-EYFP reporter
and the ability of the resulting EYFP+ cells to maintain a prolifer-
ative state on extended passaging without forced expression
of reprogramming factors. This stringent approach allowed
screening for factors/culture conditions that induced stably re-
programmed iCPCs. The iCPCs differentiate into the major cell
lineages found in the heart, including SMs, ECs, and CMs.
Most lineage reprogramming studies to date have utilized em-
bryonic or neonatal fibroblasts as a starting cell source for re-
programming. These cells, although easier to reprogram, are
clinically less relevant because comparable cell types for hu-
mans are not available. Therefore, we opted to use adult fibro-
blasts in our study. It is well documented that adult cells are

more challenging to reprogram compared
with embryonic or neonatal cells (Takaha-
shi and Yamanaka, 2006; Yu et al., 2007).
As cells mature, their epigenetic state
becomes progressively more rigid and,
therefore, less amenable to reprogramming. Therefore, the effi-
ciency of iCPC reprogramming was low (0.01%–0.02%) but
comparable with efficiencies reported for iPSC reprogramming
(Takahashi and Yamanaka, 2006). We reprogrammed fibroblasts
from both male and female mice that ranged from 1–3 months in
age, and we did not detect differences in reprogramming effi-
ciency. Although reported in vitro iCM reprogramming effi-
ciencies range from 5%–20%, it should be noted that these
values were based on the percentage of cells showing reporter
activity 1–2 weeks after infection with iCM factors. Completely
reprogrammed iCMs represent a small fraction of the cells that
initially showed reporter activity. In spite of low reprogramming
efficiencies, we were able to generate millions of stably reprog-
rammed iCPCs because of their proliferative capacity.
Based on current knowledge, transdifferentiation is thought to
be a long and stochastic process in which cells transition
through intermediate states before achieving a stable reprog-
rammed state (Jaenisch and Young, 2008). The first EYFP+ cells
364

 were detected 3–5 days after dox induction and, over the course
of 3 weeks, underwent a dramatic morphological change to
develop into proliferative colonies. The cells continued to un-
dergo morphological change for the first two to three psgs.
Gene expression analysis of psg 1 cells revealed that a relatively
small, 2- to 8-fold increase in cardiac marker expression was
sufficient to initiate reprogramming toward an iCPC state,
whereas late-psg cells demonstrated a further increase in the
expression of cardiovascular genes and a decrease in the
expression of fibroblasts genes. This indicates that even though
the Nkx2.5-EYFP reporter is activated very early (3–5 days),
iCPC reprogramming progressively continues over the initial
two to three psgs (35–40 days), after which the cells reach a sta-
ble reprogrammed state. This is in congruence with reprogram-
ming processes for iCMs (Qian et al., 2013) as well as iPSCs
(Brambrink et al., 2008).
RNA-seq analysis revealed that iCPCs have cardiac meso-
derm-restricted gene expression. Interestingly, Nanog was the
only pluripotency-associated gene upregulated in iCPCs. Nanog
is also expressed in the epiblast and prevents Bmp-induced dif-
ferentiation (Shin et al., 2011). Correspondingly, Bmp genes (4/6/
7) were downregulated in iCPCs, and negative regulators of Bmp
signaling, such as smad6/7 and Grem1, were upregulated.
Recently, it has been shown that inhibition of Bmp signaling
along with Wnt activation can maintain CPCs derived from hu-
man PSCs in a stem cell state (Cao et al., 2013).
Ieda et al. (2010) have shown that iCMs are directly reprog-
rammed from fibroblasts without transitioning through a pro-
genitor state. During iCM reprogramming, cell proliferation is
staunchly suppressed along with the activation of CM differen-
tiation-specific genes SM genes are also expressed during iCM
reprogramming (Qian et al., 2013; Wada et al., 2013). Conversely,
during iCPC reprogramming, cell proliferation is activated, car-
diac mesoderm-associated genes are turned on, and cardiac
lineage differentiation genes are not expressed. This indicates
that the reprogramming route fibroblasts follow during conver-
sion to iCPCs is distinct from the route for iCM reprogramming.
The iCPC-CMs progressively mature with extended low-
serum culture based on myofilament immunolabeling and orga-
nization. However, unlike ES- or iPSC-derived CMs, iCPC-CMs
did not exhibit spontaneous contractions in culture. Adult
heart-derived CPCs have also been differentiated into CM-like
cells in vitro, which failed to contract spontaneously. However,
we were able to induce contractions in iCPC-CMs by co-
culturing with mESC-CMs. iCPC-CMs developed gap junctions
with mESC-CMs and showed synchronous calcium transients.
This result demonstrates the ability of iCPCs to differentiate
into fully functional CMs and couple with other CMs. When in-
jected into the cardiac crescent of mouse embryos, iCPCs not
only colonized the developing heart tube but also integrated
and differentiated into CMs. We noticed that iCPC-CMs ap-
peared to mature in the cultured embryos and attain a shape
and size similar to native CMs. It is interesting to note that iCPCs
could differentiate into CMs 24–48 hr after in vivo injection. This
suggests that iCPCs, in the appropriate microenvironment, can
rapidly differentiate into functional CMs.
Lineage tracing studies have shown that the mammalian heart
is derived from progenitors of the first and second heart fields as
well as the epicardium and neural crest (Abu-Issa and Kirby,
2007). Some of these progenitor populations have been identi-
fied in vivo and during in vitro differentiation of PSCs. iCPCs
share common properties with other defined CPC populations,
such as the ability to self-renew and the potency to differentiate
into cardiac lineage cells (CMs, SMs, and ECs). The iCPCs
exhibit some heterogeneity, as detected by cell surface markers
and gene expression, so it is possible that iCPCs contain subsets
of both first heart field and second heart field CPCs, among
others. Further characterization is necessary to determine
whether iCPCs resemble one or more of these native CPC pop-
ulations. It is possible that the appropriate combination of CPCs
can generate cardiac organ buds that can be used for both drug
discovery and regenerative medicine applications (Takebe et al.,
2015). Also, the adult heart consists of distinct specialized
CMs, including atrial, ventricular, and conduction system cells.
Whether iCPCs differentiate into a particular type of CM or a
mixture of all three requires further experimentation. However,
current data examining MLC2v expression suggest a majority
of iCPC-CMs to be ventricle-like.
iCPC reprogramming provides a promising cell source for
cardiac regenerative therapy. Direct reprogramming to iCPCs
avoids transitioning through an iPSC state and, therefore, theo-
retically reduces the tumorigenic risk associated with pluripotent
cells. Also, iCPCs can be readily expanded (9.14 3 1015 million to
1 3 1016 million cells in 20 psgs), and, therefore, cardiac cell ther-
apy applications that require millions to billions of cells (progen-
itors or differentiated progeny) are possible (Lalit et al., 2014).
iCPCs injected into the adult mouse heart post-MI significantly
improved survival in treated mice. Some of the injected iCPCs
survived and differentiated into CMs, SMs, and ECs, repopulat-
ing the scar tissue with relevant cardiac lineage cells. iCPC-
derived CMs showed a mature-like, rod-shaped morphology
and alignment as well as organized cardiac actin staining. Impor-
tantly, iCPC-derived cells contributed to the vasculature within
the scar area by differentiating into SMs and ECs. These results
provide promise for future studies that can examine the effects of
iCPC therapy on cardiac functionality as well as optimize cell de-
livery strategies, including tissue-engineered scaffolds. In vivo
reprogramming post-MI of native cardiac fibroblasts to iCMs
has shown promise in mouse models (Qian et al., 2012; Song
et al., 2012), and it is possible that in vivo reprogramming into
iCPCs may show benefits. The scalability of iCPCs also enables
in vitro applications such as disease modeling, drug discovery,
and basic cardiovascular research. Future studies of the reprog-
ramming of human cells into iCPCs will be an important future
step to advance these applications.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Isolation of Primary Fibroblasts
For isolation of adult fibroblasts, the respective organs were derived from 1- 3-
month-old double-transgenic mice (Nkx2.5-EYFP/rtTA). The organs were
washed with PBS and minced in fibroblast medium (DMEM, 10% fetal bovine
serum [FBS], 1% non-essential amino acids [NEAAs]/L-glutamine/penicillin
[pen]/streptamycin [strep]) to obtain tissue pieces around 1 mm3 in size. These
were briefly trypsinized (0.25% trypsin-EDTA) for 10 min. Explants were then
plated on 0.1% gelatin-coated dishes in fibroblast medium for 10–12 days. Fi-
broblasts migrated from explants were harvested, filtered through a 40-mm cell
strainer (BD Biosciences) to avoid contamination of the heart tissue, passaged
one to two times, and frozen or used for experiments.

 Infection of Fibroblasts with Lentiviruses
Lentivirus particles were produced as detailed in the Supplemental Experi-
mental Procedures. Primary fibroblasts were seeded in a gelatinized 12-well
plate at density of 50,000 cells/well 2 days prior to infection. Cells were then
fed with lentivirus infection medium (lentivirus supernatant + 8 mg/ml Poly-
brene, Sigma), and infection was continued for 48 hr.
iCPC Culture/Differentiation Conditions
The lentivirus infection medium was replaced with iCPC induction medium
(DMEM, 10% FBS, 1% NEAA, 1% L-glutamine, 1% Pen/strep, 4 mg/ml dox
[Sigma], 2.5 mM BIO [Cayman Chemical], and 103 units/ml LIF [Millipore]). After
reprogramming was achieved, iCPCs were maintained in iCPC maintenance
medium (iCPC induction medium without dox). The iCPCs were split 1:6 on
a 10-cm dish, and a confluent dish yields 2.5–3.0 million cells. To differentiate,
iCPC were aggregated in 24-well low-attachment plates (Corning Life Sci-
ences) for 4–6 days in cardiac differentiation medium (fibroblast medium,
5 mM IWP4 [Stemgent], 50 ng/ml Bmp4 [RD Systems], 10 ng/ml Vegf [RD Sys-
tems], and 30 ng/ml bFgf [RD Systems]). Aggregates were then plated on
gelatin-coated dishes and cultured in fibroblast medium containing 1% serum
for 10–50 days.
Immunocytochemistry and Flow Cytometry
Cells were plated, fixed, and stained with various antibodies via a standard
protocol detailed in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
qRT-PCR
Total RNA was isolated using the RNAqueous kit (Invitrogen). Reverse tran-
scription was performed using iScriptTM Reserve Transcription Supermix
(Bio-Rad). qRT-PCR was performed on a CFX96TM real-time system (Bio-
Rad) using SsoFastTM EvaGreen Supermix (Bio-Rad). Minimum information
for publication of quantitative real-time PCR experiments (MIQE) guidelines
were followed when designing qPCR experiments. mRNA levels were normal-
ized by comparison with b-actin (D CT), and data are presented as fold change
with respect to expression in AC Fibs (DD CT).
RNA-Seq and Bioinformatics Analysis
RNA was extracted as above from AC Fib-derived iCPCs either at low psg (1–3)
or high psg (8–10). Gene expression data for mESC-CPCs and mESC-CMs
were obtained from Wamstad et al. (2012) and used as a positive control.
For heatmap analysis, gene expression was compared with uninfected AC
Fibs. RNA-seq was performed using HiSeq 2500 (Illumina) in duplicates from
independent biological samples. Sequencer outputs were processed using
CASAVA 1.8.2 (Illumina), and each sample’s reads were processed using
RSEM version 1.2.3 to obtain expression measures for genes. Differential anal-
ysis was done using EBSeq version 1.5.3., and the targeted false discovery
rate for each run was 0.05. Transcripts per million values were used for all cal-
culations. The Search Tool for Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins
(STRING) database was used for GO analysis (Franceschini et al., 2013).
See the Supplemental Experimental Procedures for more details.
Ca2+ Imaging
Cells were loaded with Rhod-2, AM (Invitrogen) for 20 min at 37�C in fibroblast
medium, washed, and incubated for an additional 30 min at 37�C to allow for
de-esterification of the dye. Rhod-2-loaded cells were analyzed with a Nikon
epifluorescence microscope with NIS elements software.
Embryo Injections, Immunostaining, and Imaging
Cardiac crescent-stage mouse embryos were obtained by timed matings.
iCPCs and AC Fibs were infected with a GFP lentivirus (Addgene, catalog
no. 17448) to trace cells in vivo. Approximately 200–500 iCPCs or AC Fibs
were introduced into the cardiac crescent of dissected mouse embryos in
dissection medium via a mouth-held glass capillary (�20-mm opening). Oper-
ated and stage-matched unoperated embryo samples were then placed into
whole-embryo culture medium (Downs, 2006) and cultured for 24 or 48 hr.
At the end of the culture period, embryos were imaged using a Nikon epifluor-
escence microscope to determine the location of injected GFP+ cells. Embryos
were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). Immunofluorescence of
whole-mount embryos was done, and imaging was performed using a
custom-built multi-photon microscope. Imaris software (Bitplane) was used
to make three-dimensional reconstructions. See the Supplemental Experi-
mental Procedures for more details.
Mouse MI Model and iCPC Injections
Animal use and procedures were approved by the University of Wisconsin An-
imal Care and Use Committee. MIs were induced surgically in 8-week-old male
C57BL/6J mice by permanent ligation of the left coronary artery. Two days af-
ter MI surgery, in mice with echocardiographically proven large infarctions, a
total of 1–1.5 million GFP-labeled iCPCs (reprogrammed using five factors
and AC Fibs) or PBS were injected in three injections of approximately 25 ml
in the border zone. Animals were monitored for 4 weeks, and the hearts of sur-
viving animals were excised for immunohistochemistry. See the Supplemental
Experimental Procedures for more details.
Statistical Analysis
Differences between multiple groups were tested for statistical significance
using one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post hoc analysis. For comparison
of two groups, unpaired Student’s t test was used. p < 0.05 was regarded as
significant.
