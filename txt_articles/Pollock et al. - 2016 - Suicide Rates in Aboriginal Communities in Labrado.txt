in Labrador, Canada

Objectives. To compare suicide rates in Aboriginal communities in Labrador, including
Innu, Inuit, and Southern Inuit, with the general population of Newfoundland, Canada.
Methods. In partnership with Aboriginal governments, we conducted a population-
based study to understand patterns of suicide mortality in Labrador. We analyzed suicide
mortality data from 1993 to 2009 from the Vital Statistics Death Database. We com-
bined this with community-based methods, including consultations with Elders,
youths, mental health and community workers, primary care clinicians, and govern-
ment decision-makers.
Results. The suicide rate was higher in Labrador than in Newfoundland. This trend
persisted across all age groups; however, the disparity was greatest among those aged
10 to 19 years. Males accounted for the majority of deaths, although suicide rates were
elevated among females in the Inuit communities. When comparing Aboriginal sub-
regions, the Innu and Inuit communities had the highest age-standardized mortality rates
of, respectively, 165.6 and 114.0 suicides per 100 000 person-years.
Conclusions. Suicide disproportionately affects Innu and Inuit populations in Labrador.
Suicide rates were high among male youths and Inuit females. (Am J Public Health.

lobally, suicide persists as an urgent
public health problem among In-
digenous populations in many high-income
countries, including the United States1 and
Australia.2 In Canada, suicide is one of the
leading causes of death among Aboriginal
people.3–5 Suicide rates for First Nations (31.8
per 100 000 population)6 and Inuit (73.6 per
100 000 population)5 populations are ele-
vated compared with the national rate (10.8
per 100 000 population),7 although incidence
varies substantially at the community level.8
Rate disparities are especially evident in In-
digenous regions such as Nunavut,5 an arctic
territory in northern Canada, and elsewhere
in the circumpolar world.9
Previous research reported a high suicide
rate in Labrador10,11 and suggested that local
First Nations and Inuit populations have
elevated rates of suicidal ideation12 and
death.5,10,11,13 However, these studies used
a short study period or regionally aggregated
data, focused on youths, or did not distinguish
among different Aboriginal groups. As a
result, they missed possible subregional
inequalities14 and therefore were unable to
identify specific populations with the greatest
burden.
Labrador is a large subarctic area in
northeastern Canada that borders Quebec
and Nunavut and is politically part of the
province of Newfoundland and Labrador.
The region’s diverse population is small,
relatively young, and dispersed, with a high
proportion of Aboriginal people (Table 1).
The population includes 3 Aboriginal groups:
the Mushuau and Sheshatshiu Innu First
Nations, the Labrador Inuit, and the Southern
Inuit. These groups are politically separate
and have unique cultures, languages,
traditional territories, colonial histories, and
social circumstances. We identify the Ab-
original groups with the terms used by the
respective governing authorities for collective
identity. In some cases, these terms may differ
from those used by individuals to self-identify.
For example, the NunatuKavut Community
Council refers to the group it represents as
“Southern Inuit” although individually some
community members may use the terms
“Metis” or “Inuit-Metis.” Most of Labrador’s
Aboriginal communities are located along the
remote north and southeast coasts, with
limited or no road access.
Our comparison region, Newfoundland,
is a large island that is geographically separate
from Labrador and is located in the Atlantic
region of Canada. Both areas are primarily
rural, although Newfoundland’s population is
older, is mostly non-Aboriginal, and lives
within a 300-kilometer drive of a regional
center or the provincial capital. The pop-
ulation health profile and socioeconomic and
geographic context of Labrador resembles
other circumpolar regions such as Alaska
and Greenland. Conversely, Newfoundland,
although distinct in its own right, has more
in common with the provinces of Atlantic
Canada.
We developed this retrospective,
population-based study of suicide mortality
in response to requests from communities
for local data on suicide. Our objective was
to establish baseline trends in suicide epide-
miology in Labrador. We compared age,

foundland and Labrador from 1993 to 2009.
This project was a collaborative inquiry that
combined community-based and epidemio-
logical research methods.15
METHODS
From the outset of the project, we part-
nered with the region’s Aboriginal political
authorities, including the Innu Nation,
the Nunatsiavut Government, and the
NunatuKavut Community Council (for-
merly the Labrador Metis Nation), and
with the regional health care organization,
Labrador-Grenfell Regional Health Au-
thority. Our goal was to develop an un-
derstanding of suicide rooted in the region’s
historical, cultural, and socioeconomic
contexts. For the planning phase, we conducted
consultations with Elders, youths, mental health
and community workers, primary care clinicians,
and government decision-makers. Through this
engagement, suicide prevention and the pro-
motion of resilience emerged as shared priorities
among stakeholders. Our partners also indicated
that research would be most helpful if it
informed health service planning with local
evidence.
The institutional review committees of all
4 community partners provided research
licenses for this study, and each had a repre-
sentative that maintained ongoing project
oversight. We also codeveloped distinct re-
search agreements with each partner orga-
nization. These agreements outlined our joint
commitments to project planning, data
management, and communication. We
shared the preliminary results of this study at
meetings with our research partners and
roundtable discussions with other local
stakeholders. This process helped contextualize
our discussion by eliciting interpretations of the
results from historical, sociocultural, and clinical
perspectives.16 All project partners reviewed
and approved this article before submission.
Data Sources
For our data, we drew on Statistics Can-
ada’s Vital Statistics Death Database. This
administrative data set covers all physician-
certified deaths recorded in provincial regis-
tries, and it includes a nearly complete count
of all deaths because of the legal requirement
for death registration. Each record provides
the cause of death as determined by the
Canadian Enhancement of the International
Classification of Diseases-Canada,17 10th Re-
vision (ICD-10-CA), date, and demographic
information. For our study, we examined
the following variables: death by suicide
(ICD-10-CA code X60-84), year (1993–
2009), gender, age group, region of residence
(Labrador or Newfoundland), and subregion
of residence within Labrador (Innu com-
munities, Inuit communities, Southern Inuit
communities, Labrador West, and Upper
Lake Melville). We defined subregions on the
basis of geography, sociopolitical distinctions,
and population composition (Table 1).
We used Statistics Canada’s census division
geographic units togroup regional populations
for Labrador and Newfoundland, and we
determined subregional populations by com-
bining smaller units (census subdivisions) that
are approximately equivalent to communities
(Table A, available as a supplement to the
online version of this article at http://www.
ajph.org). We used “subregion” as a geo-
graphic proxy for the Aboriginal groups be-
cause vital statistics do not include record-level
Aboriginal identifiers.14,18,19 We defined each
subregion by the proportion of the population
that was Aboriginal on the basis of census data
(Table 1), as has been done elsewhere.3,4 We
refer to the subregions that include pre-
dominantly Aboriginal communities by their
specific population (Innu communities, Inuit
communities, and Southern Inuit communi-
ties) rather than their place names (e.g., She-
shatshiu and Natuashish, Nunatsiavut, South
Coast-Straits).

 region, subregion, gender, and age groups
using crude rates and directly
age-standardized mortality rates (ASMRs),
rate ratios (RRs), and 95% confidence in-
tervals (CIs). We calculated incidence as a rate
per 100 000 person-years for the 17-year
study period by dividing the total number of
deaths in each stratum for all years combined
by the corresponding population.
For the denominators, we estimated
person-years at risk by totaling the annual
population counts by age and gender strata
categories within each region and subregion
from Statistics Canada’s censuses for 1991,
1996, 2001, 2006, and 2011. For the
population estimates in noncensus years,
we imputed counts from the most proximal
census. For example, we used the 2001
census as the estimate for each year from
1999 to 2003. To make a comparison of rates,
we age-standardized rates on the basis of
5-year age groups to the 1991 Canadian
Standard Population and calculated 95%
CIs. We selected this commonly used
standard population to improve compara-
bility between our research and other studies.
We aggregated data by combining sub-
groups to achieve a minimum count of 20
deaths per strata or a relative standard error
(RSE) below 23%, in accordance with
benchmarks for the analysis of small numbers.
Rather than uniformly suppressing results
for strata above the RSE threshold, we re-
ported findings and interpreted them with
caution when they werelocally meaningful or
had marginal reliability (RSE 23%–25%) or
when it was inappropriate to combine cells.
For example, we reported the ASMR for
women in Inuit communities on the basis of
n = 16 deaths, even although rate stability was
borderline.
We used Newfoundland as the reference
group and calculated RRs with 95% CIs using
the method of Greenland and Rothman (see
reference in Appendix A, available as a sup-
plement to the online version of this article at
http://www.ajph.org). After we compared
the rates, we considered them to be signifi-
cantly different if the RR limits did not
contain 1. We conducted the analysis with
SPSS version 21.0 (SPSS, Inc, Chicago, IL)
and Stata version 13.1 (StataCorp LP, College
Station, TX).
RESULTS
There were 128 suicide deaths in Labrador
and 617 in Newfoundland during the study
period, and the majority of suicide deaths
in Labrador occurred in the Inuit (n= 64;
50.0%) and Innu (n= 28; 21.9%) communi-
ties.These2subregionsinclude7communities
that had a combined population of 4230 in
2006, or 0.84% of the provincial population,
but accounted for 12.3% of suicide deaths in
the province during the study period.
We found substantial differences in suicide
rates between regions and among specific
Labrador subregions (Table 2). The ASMR for
suicide in Labrador was 4 times higher
(RR = 4.0; 95% CI = 3.2, 4.8) than was that in
Newfoundland (31.8 vs 8.0 per 100 000 per-
son-years). Within Labrador, the Inuit and
Innu communities had the proportionately
largest Aboriginal populations (Table 1) and
the highest ASMR and RRs for suicide
(Table 2).
The gender divide in suicide mortality
was similar in Labrador and Newfound-
land because males accounted for the
majority of deaths (respectively, n = 110;
85.9% and n = 522; 84.6%) and had higher
ASMRs than did females in both regions
(Table 2). However, rates were higher for
both genders in Labrador than in New-
foundland (Table 2). In Labrador, 88.9%
(n = 16) of the female suicides were in the
Inuit communities, where the ASMR among
females was 31 times higher than was that
in Newfoundland (RR = 31.5; 95%
CI = 18.3, 54.4).
The mean age of individuals who died by
suicide was 28.8 years (SD = 13.6) in Labrador
and 44.3 years (SD = 16.2) in Newfoundland.
The suicide rate was highest among those
aged 20 to 29 years in Labrador, and 30 to 39
and 40 to 49 years in Newfoundland (Figure 1;
Table B available as a supplement to the
online version of this article at http://www.
ajph.org), although the age-specific disparity
was largest among youths aged 10 to
19 years, the rate being nearly 16 times higher
(RR = 15.8; 95% CI = 9.6, 26.0) in Labrador
(Figure 1, Table B).
DISCUSSION
We found large suicide rate disparities
between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal
populations in Labrador, with the highest
rates in the Innu and Inuit communities.
To our knowledge, this is the first study to
examine suicide among Southern Inuit and to
show subregional suicide rate variation across
Labrador. The rate difference between Lab-
rador and Newfoundland is consistent with
previous research,10,11 although our esti-
mated RR is slightly higher (4.0 vs 3.3).
Overall, the suicide rate in Labrador was
nearly 3 times higher than the national rate
in Canada, while the suicide rates in the
Innu and Inuit communities were 10 and 15
times higher, respectively. These patterns are
similar to those found in other studies of
Indigenous and circumpolar populations in
Canada and internationally.1,2,5,6,8,9,20
Males were disproportionately affected by
suicide in our study, and the majority of
suicide deaths in the Aboriginal communities
in Labrador were among males younger
than 30 years, which is consistent with the
literature.6,9,20 This trend differs from the
general population in Canada, where rates
are highest among men aged 45 to 49 years.21
In Newfoundland, male ASMRs in our
study peaked across 2 age groups (30–39 years
and 40–49 years), which is also younger
than in Canada.
One important gender difference we
discovered was the absence of any suicide
deaths among women in Innu communities,
which contrasted with the high rate among
Innu men. This may be partially explained
by a gendered trend toward choosing more
lethal attempt methods in this community as
in the general population.22 However, the
absence of suicide among Innu women also
contrasted with women in Inuit communi-
ties, where we identified an extraordinary
inequality compared with women in New-
foundland. In part, the magnitude of this
disparity may be related to the exceptionally
low ASMR among women in Newfound-
land, who have the lowest incidence rate of
either gender in all provinces and territories in
Canada.7,21 Nonetheless, the ASMR for
women in Inuit communities in our study was
twice as high as was that for all other Inuit
regions in Canada combined and approxi-
mately 17 times higher than is the national
rate among women.5 We note that
ASMR for women in Inuit communities
had borderline reliability as the RSE (25%)
was slightly above the threshold.

 The geographic and gender differences we
found likely arise from complex interactions
between risks related to mental health
problems, access to care, and socioecological
conditions. Many Aboriginal communities
in Labrador are geographically remote and
have limited access to comprehensive mental
health services. This may increase vulnera-
bility in communities with an already elevated
prevalence of self-reported depression, sui-
cidal ideation, and suicide attempts,12,23 all
of which are known risks for suicide.24 A
recent follow-back study among Inuit in
Nunavut found that mental illness, substance
abuse, and childhood maltreatment were
strong predictors of suicide.25 Although there
is uncertainty about the role of mental illness
as a risk factor for suicide in Aboriginal
communities,25,26 psychological distress and
social adversity are likely interconnected25
and may affect suicidality among men and
women differently. For those communities
that are already at increased risk because of
mental health and social problems, young
people in particular may be additionally
vulnerable following a suicide by a peer,
owing to the influence of social contagion.27
Increasingly, research has linked suicide in
Aboriginal contexts to social distress and
historical trauma, which have their origins in
persistent and systemic inequality.26,28,29
Aboriginal communities in Labrador have
experienced immense social disruptions, such
as the government-initiated relocations of
northern settlements in the mid-20th cen-
tury. The health consequences of such his-
torical events and resulting social changes may
be long lasting and may persist across gen-
erations,30 but the repercussions probably
have different impacts on men and women
and on different communities. As a risk factor,
varied experiences of historical trauma might
in part explain the geographic and gender
variations in suicide rates.
Political and Socioeconomic
Context
At a structural level, political and socio-
economic conditions may also contribute to
rate disparities. A study of First Nations
communities in British Columbia found that
low suicide rates were associated with a higher
degree of political self-determination related
to land claims and local governance but not
with socioeconomic factors.8 The possible
influence of community self-determination
on suicide or other health indicators in
Labrador remains unclear. Local governance
and the land claims process evolved for each of
the Aboriginal groups during the study pe-
riod. The Labrador Inuit established their land
claims agreement in 2005; the Innu Nation
and NunatuKavut Community Council’s
land claims have not been settled, though the
Innu reached an agreement-in-principle in
2011. These groups differ in the degree of
control they have over natural resources and
health and social services; however, these
differences do not seem to correspond with
inequalities in suicide.
Kirmayer suggested that the uneven dis-
tribution of socioeconomic factors might
contribute to suicide rate variability in Ab-
original communities (supplemental citations
can be found in Appendix A). Evidence from
the general literature is mixed but seems

 to show an inverse relationship between
area-level poverty and suicide rates.31 In
contrast to the British Columbia study, to
some extent we found that the ASMR var-
iations seemed inversely related to socio-
economic indicators. Labrador West had the
highest personal income per capita (Table 3)
and the lowest suicide rate in the region,
whereas the Southern Inuit communities
had relatively low incomes but the second
lowest ASMR (Table 3). By contrast,
for Aboriginal communities in northern
Labrador, where suicide rates were the
highest, per capita income was the third
lowest of any region in the province (Table 3).
In addition to low incomes, families in many
of the Aboriginal communities experience
food and housing insecurity.12,23
The suicide rate disparities we identified
are important in the context of broader social
inequality because they help reveal high-risk
areas where Aboriginal-specific health de-
terminants are likely important factors. For
example, many circumpolar regions are facing
new public health threats related to climate
change; recent studies in Inuit communities
have shown that less predictable environ-
mental conditions are decreasing safe access to
the land, which in turn may affect mental
health.32 This emerging evidence is part of
a broader recognition of the relationships
between colonial policies, marginalization,
connections to the land, and disparities in
Aboriginal health.28–30 In suicide prevention,
and in Aboriginal health research in general,
we continue to be challenged by calls to
bridge the “epistemological divide”15(pe5)
between Western and Indigenous forms of
evidence and approaches to intervention.
In Canada, landmark efforts such as those
of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal
Peoples and the Truth and Reconciliation
Commission have made vital contributions to
our understanding of the complex relation-
ships between historical and contemporary
social factors and inequitable health status.
These works have helped reveal and give
voice to the individual and collective expe-
riences of intergenerational trauma related
to Canada’s residential school system. This
trauma has fostered and compounded the
poor health and mental health that persists in
many Aboriginal communities today.28–30
This understanding helps us trace the path-
ways that contribute to social distress and,
conversely, to resilience. As suicide remains
an important driver of the overall health gap
between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal
people,18 knowledge of the determinants of
Indigenous health must continue to inform
the evolution of suicide prevention.
Suicide Prevention in Aboriginal
Communities
At present, there is limited but emerging
evidence of effective approaches to suicide
prevention in Aboriginal populations.33,34 It
suggests that we are most likely to prevent
suicide when communities have sustainable
resources and are in control of the

 intervention process. More specifically, the
literature emphasizes the need for inter-
ventions that redress structural inequalities
such as poverty, are focused on collective
change rather than individual deficits, are
embedded in a social context, and are rooted
in culturally specific knowledge.8,26,28,33–36
Elsewhere, comprehensive public health in-
terventions have successfully reduced suicide
and suicide attempt rates,37,38 including
rates among youths and rural populations.38
Some components of these approaches may
be relevant in some Aboriginal contexts.
Limitations and Strengths
One limitation in our study was the pos-
sibility that suicides may have been under-
reported or misclassified.10,11 Another
limitation was that Canada’s vital statistics
registry lacks Aboriginal identifiers.19 To
overcome this, we used a geographic ap-
proach similar to that used in other studies.3,4
Although this could result in the misclassifi-
cation of non-Aboriginal deaths in Aboriginal
subregions and contribute to conservative
rate estimates, it is less likely where pop-
ulations are predominantly Aboriginal. An-
other consequence of the lack of identifiers
was that we could not determine group-
specific rates within a subregion with more
than 1 Aboriginal group, such as Upper Lake
Melville. The geographic approach is also
problematic because the Canadian census
underenumerates Aboriginal people.19 This
results in incomplete dominator data and
consequently may have affected the accuracy
of our mortality estimates.19
Another limitation was that we were
unable to examine community-level rate
variation because of small cell counts and
wide CIs, which occurred even at the sub-
regional level. Our ASMRs for Upper Lake
Melville, Labrador West, and the Southern
Inuit communities were less stable for these
reasons, as were our estimates for specific
subpopulations such as females. However,
because data before 1993 was of poor quality
and data after 2009 was not released for
analysis, our data set was the largest, most
reliable, and most up-to-date mortality data
available in the province. Overall, we believe
that these limitations are balanced by the
comprehensiveness of the data set and a cau-
tious interpretation of our results.
Our study also had multiple strengths. We
were the first, to our knowledge, to examine
suicide mortality differences by subregion
and in all Aboriginal groups in Labrador. We
used disaggregated data and uncovered dra-
matic inequalities between Innu, Inuit, and
non-Aboriginal populations that otherwise
might have remained hidden. Too often,
health disparities are obscured in provincial
and national estimates that do not detect
localized differences such as the relative
absence of suicide14,15 or are unable to dis-
tinguish between specific cultural groups.14
Although we reported select rates that were
less reliable, including those for strata with
counts of 0 or 1, the majority of our ASMR
and age-specific rates were stable, especially
when disparities were the greatest. This dis-
aggregation offers specificity for local con-
texts, which is integral for Indigenous
statistics.15,19 This approach reflects our
community-based methodology, which is
another strength of our study.
Community-Based Epidemiology
Epidemiological methods are often seen as
incongruent with the qualitative and partic-
ipatory approaches that are favored in
many Aboriginal contexts.39 Indeed much
quantitative research in Aboriginal health is
investigator driven and does not respect
community governance, research priorities,
or autonomy over data.15,39 Recent
studies12,23,35 have demonstrated that
community-based epidemiology in Indige-
nous contexts is both feasible and valuable,
and some authors argue that this is a critical
methodological shift that must take place in
future research on suicide in Indigenous
communities.15
Our study contributes to this literature by
focusing on meeting a community-identified
research need through collaborative rela-
tionships, which we demonstrated in multiple
ways. We obtained research permits from
our partners’ institutional review committees
and codeveloped research agreements related
to data management and knowledge trans-
lation. We also conducted consultations
to guide study planning and to develop
a contextual understanding of our results.
Last, we disaggregated suicide rates to provide
subregional estimates. By conducting research
in this manner and by reporting these
processes, we respected key ethical standards
in Aboriginal health research.
As Aboriginal communities and govern-
ments continue to assert control over terri-
tories, economic resources, and health
systems, this study can serve as an example of
a multisector collaboration in public health
research that can inform these efforts. Our
results underscore the need to disaggregate
data to uncover variations in local health status
and identify the most vulnerable groups.
In developing partnerships and sharing
these results with Aboriginal groups, our
study provides evidence to health system
decision-makers who can then allocate re-
sources in proportion to community need14
and support community mobilization of
suicide prevention.
Conclusions
Our results confirmed that the suicide rate
in Labrador was higher than that in New-
foundland and revealed that rates were ele-
vated in 2 specific Aboriginal populations.
Young males accounted for the majority of all
suicides and had the highest rates in all areas,
although females in Inuit communities had
the greatest rate disparity. Our results illu-
minate an area of substantial health inequality
between the 2 regions and between Ab-
original and non-Aboriginal populations.
These findings reinforce the need to close the
gap on health inequality between Aboriginal
and non-Aboriginal communities. In Labra-
dor, this will be aided by long-term public
health approaches to suicide prevention that
target high-risk subregions.
