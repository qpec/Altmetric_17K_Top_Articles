Abstract
Purpose—To examine the association of strength training with incident type 2 diabetes and 
cardiovascular disease risk.
Methods—We followed 35 754 healthy women (mean age, 62.6 years, range 47.0 – 97.8) from 
the Women's Health Study, who responded to a health questionnaire that included physical activity 
questions in 2000; assessing health outcomes through annual health questionnaire through 2014 
(average (SD) follow-up = 10.7 (3.7) years). Incident type 2 diabetes (N cases = 2120) and 
cardiovascular disease (N cases = 1742) were confirmed on medical record review. Cases of 
cardiovascular disease were defined as confirmed cases of myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary 
artery bypass graft, angioplasty, or cardiovascular disease death
Results—Compared to women who reported no strength training, women engaging in any 
strength training experienced a reduced rate of type 2 diabetes of 30% (hazard ratio: 0.70, 95% 
confidence interval: 0.61, 0.80) when controlling for time spent in other activities and other 
confounders. A risk reduction of 17% was observed for cardiovascular disease among women 
engaging in strength training (HR: 0.83, 95% CI: 0.72, 0.96). Participation in both strength 
training and aerobic activity was associated with additional risk reductions for both type 2 diabetes 
and cardiovascular disease compared to participation in aerobic activity only.

 Conclusions—These data support the inclusion of muscle-strengthening exercises in physical 
activity regimens for reduced risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, independent of 
aerobic exercise. Further research is needed to determine the optimum dose and intensity of 
muscle-strengthening exercises.

Introduction
Federal physical activity guidelines recommend muscle-strengthening activities at least 
twice a week in addition to at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-to-vigorous aerobic 
physical activity for health benefits.(27) While the primary rationale for including muscle-
strengthening activities in the guidelines was musculoskeletal health,(18) muscle-
strengthening activities have recently been associated with reduced risk factors of type 2 
diabetes and cardiovascular disease.(18, 26, 30) However, there is little research directly 
examining the longitudinal associations of weight lifting and strength training with incident 
type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease risk.(2, 8, 9, 18)
Several biological mechanisms support a hypothesis of muscle-strengthen activities reducing 
the risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Resistance training has been shown to 
increase muscle mass, reduce BMI, improve insulin sensitivity, and increase glucose 
transport.(17, 26, 30) The majority of literature investigating the association of muscle-
strengthening exercises with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease risk has been limited 
to short-term randomized control trials examining biomarkers of type 2 diabetes and 
cardiovascular risk.(18, 26) A recent meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials has 
highlighted that weight lifting alone or in combination with aerobic exercise increases 
muscle size, reduces weight, lowers cardiovascular risk factors, and increases glycemic 
control.(30) Interestingly, this meta-analysis also directly compared the effects of resistance 
exercise and aerobic exercise and found little to no difference between the two types of 
physical activity on the outcomes listed. It is unclear if these associations in short duration 
trials of biomarkers translate into reduced rates of incident disease.
The few studies examining weight lifting and incident cases of type 2 diabetes and 
cardiovascular disease have reported inconsistent results. An analysis of men from the 
Health Professional Follow-up Study, by Tanasescu et al, reported that weight lifting was 
associated with a 23% risk reduction for coronary heart disease.(25) However, a later 
analysis including 10 more years of follow-up of the same men, and that also examined 
stroke, by Chomistek et al, found no significant association of weight lifting with 
cardiovascular disease (i.e., including coronary heart disease and stroke outcomes).(2) When 
examining type 2 diabetes in this cohort, Grontved et al observed an inverse dose response 
of time spent weight lifting and incident type 2 diabetes, ranging from a 12% to 34% rate 
reduction.(9) A recent analysis of the Nurses' Health Study reported that women engaging in 
muscle-strengthening exercises had a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes ranging from 7% to 
40%.(8)

 Therefore, to provide additional information, in a large, prospective cohort of older women, 
we examined the associations of strength training with incident type 2 diabetes and 
cardiovascular disease.
Methods
Study Participants
We analyzed data from the Women's Health Study – a completed randomized trial 
examining low-dose aspirin and vitamin E for the prevention of cardiovascular disease and 
cancer among 39 876 healthy women, conducted from 1992 to 2004.(4, 14, 19) Women 
completed health questionnaires every 6 months during the first year, and then annually 
thereafter. Following the scheduled conclusion of the trial, women have been followed in an 
observational study. For this study, the 37 162 women who returned the 96-month 
questionnaire (that included a question on strength training) were eligible. We excluded 
1408 women with missing information on physical activity on this questionnaire, described 
below. For diabetes analyses, we excluded 2291 women with diabetes diagnosis before the 
96-month questionnaire, resulting in an analysis sample of 33 463. For cardiovascular 
disease, we excluded 822 women with cardiovascular disease diagnoses before the 96-month 
questionnaire, resulting in an analysis sample of 34 932. Women provided written consent to 
participate, and the study was approved by the institutional review board of Brigham and 
Women's Hospital.
Assessment of Physical Activity
On the baseline health questionnaire and periodically during follow-up, women reported 
their walking pace, flights of stairs climbed, and time spent per week in various leisure time 
activities or groups of activities. A strength training question was added to the list of 
activities on the 96-month questionnaire (see Figure, Supplemental Digital Content, Physical 
Activity Questionnaire, Women's Health Study), “During the past year, what was your 
approximate time per week spent at each of the following recreational activities? Weight 
lifting / strength training.” The physical activity questionnaire is based on the College 
Alumni Health Study questionnaire,(1) and has been shown to be reliable and valid.(29) In 
women, the 2-year test-retest correlation was 0.59 and when compared to four past-week 
activity recalls and four 7-day diaries, physical activity estimates yielded correlations of 0.79 
and 0.62, respectively.(29) For the present analysis, we used physical activity assessments 
starting with the 96-month questionnaire and updated from the 120-, 144-, 168-, 192-, and 
216-month follow-up questionnaires.
Women were categorized based on minutes per week spent strength training and aerobic 
activities during the past year. Aerobic activities included jogging; running; tennis / squash / 
racquetball; walking; bicycling; aerobic exercise / aerobic dance / exercise machines; lap 
swimming; stair climbing; and other aerobic activities (see Figure, Supplemental Digital 
Content, Physical Activity Questionnaire, Women's Health Study). The 5 categories were: 
no participation, 1 to <20 minutes, 20 to <60 minutes, 60 to <120 minutes, and ≥120 
minutes per week of participation. “Lower intensity and conditioning activities” included

 yoga, stretching, toning, and other lower intensity exercises (see Figure, Supplemental 
Digital Content, Physical Activity Questionnaire, Women's Health Study).
Assessment of Covariates, Cardiovascular Disease, and Type 2 Diabetes
Baseline information was collected on age, height, weight, smoking habits, menopausal 
status, hormone use, and parental history of myocardial infarction before age 60 years. 
Dietary habits (including alcohol consumption) were assessed using a semi-quantitative food 
questionnaire.(28) All information, except for diet, was updated from the annual follow-up 
questionnaires.
We ascertained type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease using standard methods of the 
Women's Health Study as described previously.(6, 15, 16) Briefly, women reported incident 
type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease on annual follow-up questionnaires. Cases of type 
2 diabetes were validated using the American Diabetic Association criteria through a 
telephone interview, supplemental questionnaire, and medical records. Ascertainment of 
self-reported T2DM using these methods has been shown to have a positive predictive value 
of 91%.(5) Cases of cardiovascular disease were defined as confirmed cases of myocardial 
infarction, stroke, coronary artery bypass graft, angioplasty, or cardiovascular disease death. 
Study physicians reviewed medical records to confirm cases of cardiovascular disease. 
Women were followed from the date women returned the 96-month questionnaire through 
2014 (≥99% complete).
Statistical Analyses
Participant characteristics were described by minutes per week of strength training. For 
strength training and aerobic activities, we calculated hazard ratios (HR) and 95% 
confidence intervals (95% CI) comparing the rates of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular 
disease across categories of time spent per week in each activity type using Cox proportional 
hazard models.
For all analyses, we employed three nested analytical models:
1.
Multivariable adjusted model 1: adjusted for age, smoking status, alcohol 
consumption, vegetable and fruit intake, saturated fat intake, total caloric 
intake, parental history of myocardial infarction, postmenopausal status, 
hormone therapy, randomization arm during the trial period;
2.
Multivariable adjusted model 2: multivariable adjusted model 1, 
additionally adjusting for time spent in other activities (lower intensity 
activities and either strength training or aerobic activity);
3.
Multivariable adjusted model 3: multivariable adjusted model 2, 
additionally adjusted for body mass index (BMI), calculated as weight 
(kg) divided by height squared (m2)
Nested models were used to examine the effects of different levels of potential confounder 
adjustment. Multivariable model 2 controlled for the overall physical activity volume to 
examine strength training independent of other physical activities, while model 3 examines

 the effects of controlling (or potentially over-adjusting) for the potential intermediate of 
BMI. The proportional hazards assumption was tested and found to meet the assumptions.
To examine the joint association of strength training and aerobic activity, we compared the 
rates of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease across the combinations of strength 
training (participation or no participation) and aerobic activities (no aerobic activities, ≥1 
minute to <120 minutes, ≥120 minutes per week). The joint association of strength training 
and aerobic activity was modeled using multivariable adjusted model 2. Due to the low 
number of cases among those who participated in strength training but no aerobic activities, 
we did not formally test for statistical interaction.
Results
Participant characteristics by categories of time spent strength training are displayed in Table 
1. At the time of the 96-month questionnaire, 6742 (18.9%) women engaged in some 
strength training. On average, women were 62.6 years old (SD = 6.9, range = 47.0 – 97.8) 
with a BMI of 27.0 kg/m2 (SD = 5.5). Women who reported participating in any amount of 
strength training were more likely to have a lower BMI, more likely to engage in healthy 
dietary patterns, and less likely to be a current smoker compared to women who did not 
participate in strength training.
From 2000 to 2014, 2120 women developed type 2 diabetes (average follow-up of 10.7 
years (SD = 3.7)) and 1742 women developed cardiovascular disease (average follow-up of 
11.2 years (SD = 2.9)). Participation in any strength training was associated with a 30% rate 
reduction of type 2 diabetes (HR = 0.70 (95% CI: 0.61, 0.80), p <0.001) compared to no 
participation, adjusting for time spent in lower intensity and aerobic activities and model 1 
covariates (age, smoking status, alcohol consumption, vegetable and fruit intake, saturated 
fat intake, total caloric intake, parental history of myocardial infarction, postmenopausal 
status, hormone therapy, randomization arm during the trial period). Compared to women 
who did not participate in any strength training, women who engaged in 1 to <20 minutes, 
20 to <60 minutes, 60 to <120 minutes, and ≥120 minutes per week experienced 
multivariable adjusted type 2 diabetes rate reductions of 33% (0.67 (0.54, 0.84)), 22% (0.78 
(0.62, 0.98)), 32% (0.68 (0.54, 0.86)), and 35% (0.65 (0.47, 0.91)) (p trend <0.001, Table 2).
We observed an inverse dose response of aerobic activity and type 2 diabetes rates that 
persisted after controlling for lower intensity activities, strength training, and model 1 
covariates (p trend <0.001, Table 2). Among women who participated in 1 to <20 minutes, 
20 to <60 minutes, 60 to <120 minutes, and ≥120 minutes per week, we observed type 2 
diabetes hazard ratios of 0.86 (95% CI: 0.72, 1.03), 0.75 (0.62, 0.91), 0.66 (0.55, 0.79), and 
0.49 (0.42, 0.58), compared to women who did not participate in aerobic activity. Further 
adjustment for body mass index attenuated the associations of strength training or aerobic 
activity with type 2 diabetes.
Women who participated in strength training experienced a 17% rate reduction of 
cardiovascular disease (HR = 0.83 (95% CI: 0.72, 0.96), p = 0.01) compared to women who 
did not after adjusting for model 1 covariates and time spent in lower intensity and aerobic

 activities. Compared to women who did not participate in any strength training, women who 
engaged in 1 to <20 minutes, 20 to <60 minutes, 60 to <120 minutes, and ≥120 minutes per 
week experienced risk reductions of 20% (0.80 (0.62, 1.03)), 9% (0.91 (0.71, 1.17)), 26% 
(0.74 (0.57, 0.96)), and 6% (0.94 (0.68, 1.29)) (p trend =0.03, Table 3).
We observed an inverse dose response of aerobic activity and cardiovascular disease, 
adjusting for model 1 covariates and time spent in lower intensity activities and strength 
training (p trend <0.001, Table 3). Among women who participated in 1 to <20 minutes, 20 
to <60 minutes, 60 to <120 minutes, and ≥120 minutes per week, we observed 
cardiovascular disease hazard ratios of 0.81 (95% CI: 0.66, 1.01), 0.91 (0.73, 1.13), 0.72 
(0.58, 0.89), and 0.66 (0.55, 0.79), compared to women who did not participate in aerobic 
activity. Additionally adjusting for BMI did not substantially alter the associations of 
strength training or aerobic activity with cardiovascular disease.
Engaging in both strength training and aerobic activity was associated with a greater rate 
reduction of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease compared to aerobic activity alone 
(Table 4). Compared to women who participated in neither strength training nor aerobic 
activity, women who participated in both strength training and ≥120 minutes of aerobic 
activity experienced a type 2 diabetes rate reduction of 65% (HR = 0.35 (95% CI: 0.28, 
0.44)), while women participating in ≥120 minutes of aerobic activity alone (but no strength 
training) experienced a 48% reduction (0.52 (0.43, 0.62)). This additional reduction 
associated with strength training persisted when adjusting for the total physical activity time 
among women participating in ≥120 minutes of aerobic activity (p <0.05). Similar trends 
were observed when examining cardiovascular disease (Table 4). Women participating in 
both strength training and ≥120 minutes of aerobic activity had the largest cardiovascular 
rate reduction of 39% (0.61 (0.48, 0.78)), while women participating in aerobic activity 
alone experienced a reduction of 21% (0.79 (0.65, 0.96)).
Discussion
Consistent evidence has shown that aerobic physical activity is associated with decreased 
rates of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.(10, 18, 20, 21) However, limited data 
exist examining the associations of strength training with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular 
disease.(2, 8, 9, 18) This study is one of the first studies to specifically examine the 
longitudinal effects of strength training with incident type 2 diabetes or cardiovascular 
disease. In a large cohort of older women, we observed that participating in strength training 
was associated with a significant reduction in both type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular 
disease compared to not participating in strength training when adjusting for time spent in 
other activities.
These findings are similar to studies conducted in a cohort of men and women from the 
Health Professionals Follow-up Study and Nurses' Health Study, which reported that weight 
lifting was associated with reduced rates of type 2 diabetes.(8, 9) Grontved et al observed an 
inverse dose response of time spent weight lifting and incident type 2 diabetes in men, 
ranging from a 12% to 34% rate reduction.(9) Women in the present study also had a risk 
reduction for any participation in strength training of 22% to 35%, but we did not observe a

 clear dose response. A recent report from the Nurses' Health Study noted that women 
engaging in muscle-strengthening exercises had a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes ranging 
from 7% to 40%.(8) In a cohort of male and female Japanese workers, participation in 
strength training was associated with a 34% decrease in risk of type 2 diabetes.(12) In the 
Health Professionals Follow-up Study, Tanasescu et al observed that weight lifting was also 
associated with reductions in coronary heart disease.(25) To our knowledge there is no 
comparable study examining weight lifting and incident cardiovascular disease in women.
However, in cross-sectional data, Drenowatz et al showed that women (n = 7321) reporting 
resistance exercise had fewer cardiovascular disease risk factors, including lower body fat, 
fasting glucose, and total cholesterol.(7) Additionally, studies examining measured muscle 
strength and cardiovascular disease have shown that grip strength is associated with fewer 
cardiovascular risk factors as well as a lower risk of cardiovascular events.(13, 22)
Women who participated in higher amounts of both strength training and aerobic activity 
had a greater reduction in type 2 diabetes than those who engaged in higher levels of 
strength training or aerobic activity alone. These data give evidence that the benefits of 
strength training and aerobic activity are independent and additional benefit may be 
conferred by participation in both even after controlling for total minutes spent in physical 
activity. Similar findings of larger magnitude of risk reduction with the combination of both 
types of activity also were observed in the Nurses' Health Study.(8) Church et al, in a trial of 
262 adults with diabetes, observed that a combination of resistance and aerobic training 
improved HbA1c, while aerobic or resistance training individually did not.(3) However, the 
combination group lost nearly twice the body weight compared to the individual treatment 
arms (-1.5kg in the combination group compared to -0.8 kg in aerobic group and -0.3 kg in 
the resistance group). This significantly larger weight loss may account for the lack of effect 
within the individual arms. A similar effect of body weight was also seen in the WHS data 
where after controlling for BMI, the association of strength training and type 2 diabetes was 
attenuated and became statistically non-significant. It is also possible that adjusting for BMI 
when examining strength training and diabetes may be over-adjustment, removing part of 
the causal pathway.
Previous studies examining biomarkers and risk factors may provide a mechanistic 
explanation of the independent benefit of strength training. Resistance training has been 
shown to increase muscle mass and reduce BMI, potentially leading to greater insulin 
sensitivity.(30) Randomized controlled trials of resistance exercise either by itself or in 
combination with aerobic activity have shown resistance exercise can improve glycemic 
control among diabetics.(26) This increase in muscle mass may lower future risk of type 2 
diabetes as hypertrophy is associated with increased glucose transport and insulin sensitivity.
(17) While endurance training has also been shown to improve glucose metabolism, (23, 24) 
the larger gains in hypertrophy from strength training may explain the greater risk reduction 
for type 2 diabetes than cardiovascular disease among those participating in both strength 
training and aerobic activities. Yang et al, in a recent meta-analysis of randomized control 
trials, reported that resistance exercise conferred no additional reduction in cardiovascular 
disease risk factors, such as lipid profile, compared to aerobic activity.(30)

 Strengths of this study include the large sample of older women in the WHS with nearly 
complete follow-up over an average of greater than 10 years. However, several limitations 
are worth noting. Although detailed, physical activity was self-reported. Information on 
strength training was limited to the time spent per week, and did not include data on 
intensity or specific strength training exercises. Thus, these data cannot determine an ideal 
dose or intensity of strength training for reduced rates of type 2 diabetes or cardiovascular 
disease. In addition, the WHS questionnaire did not ask about the frequency of training 
sessions, and thus we were unable to directly examine the guideline recommendation of at 
least twice a week of muscle-strengthening exercises. While women who decide to 
participate in muscle-strengthening activities may be a self-selected group, we observed that 
nearly 1/5th of WHS women participate in some strength training. This is a similar 
proportion to other large US cohorts such as NHIS (16.2%) and BRFSS (19.1%).(11) In 
these analyses, we carefully controlled for both demographic and health characteristics to 
reduce this potential selection bias. Future randomized controlled trials may further help 
reduce the potential of selection bias and reverse causation.
Type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease were self-reported and confirmed by medical 
report. However, the potential ‘screening bias’ for diabetes is likely small as analyses limited 
to those women who reported glucose screenings did not alter the associations. While 
coronary revascularization as an outcome may be susceptible to biases due to referral or 
disease severity, sensitivity analyses eliminating revascularization from the outcome 
definition did not show substantial differences from the current analyses. While information 
of confounders was collected in detail and updated over time, residual confounding remains 
a potential limitation. Sensitivity analyses were conducted by adding hypertension and high 
cholesterol to the BMI model, but showed no differences. Furthermore, it is possible due to 
the high correlation between aerobic activity and strength training (Table 1), that in spite of 
adjusting for time spent in aerobic activity and lower intensity activities in Model 2, residual 
confounding may remain. Lastly, Women in WHS are older, primarily white, and of high 
education and socioeconomic status, which may limit the generalizability of our findings.
In conclusion, we observed a substantial decrease in type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular 
disease rates among those who participated in strength training compared to those who did 
not engage in any strength training, independent of participation in other activities. These 
data suggest that including strength training in a physical activity regimen, as recommended 
by the federal guidelines, may result in decreased rates of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular 
disease. Further research is needed to determine an optimum dose and intensity of muscle-
strengthening activities for the reduction of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease rates.
