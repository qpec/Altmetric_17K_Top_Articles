Summary
Background The use of prophylactic radiotherapy to prevent procedure-tract metastases (PTMs) in malignant pleural 
mesothelioma remains controversial, and clinical practice varies worldwide. We aimed to compare prophylactic 
radiotherapy with deferred radiotherapy (given only when a PTM developed) in a suitably powered trial.
Methods We did a multicentre, open-label, phase 3, randomised controlled trial in 22 UK hospitals of patients with 
histocytologically proven mesothelioma who had undergone large-bore pleural interventions in the 35 days prior to 
recruitment. Eligible patients were randomised (1:1), using a computer-generated sequence, to receive immediate 
radiotherapy (21 Gy in three fractions within 42 days of the pleural intervention) or deferred radiotherapy (same dose 
given within 35 days of PTM diagnosis). Randomisation was minimised by histological subtype, surgical versus 
non-surgical procedure, and pleural procedure (indwelling pleural catheter vs other). The primary outcome was the 
incidence of PTM within 7 cm of the site of pleural intervention within 12 months from randomisation, assessed in 
the intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered with ISRCTN, number ISRCTN72767336.
Findings Between Dec 23, 2011, and Aug 4, 2014, we randomised 203 patients to receive immediate radiotherapy 
(n=102) or deferred radiotherapy (n=101). The patients were well matched at baseline. No signifi
 cant diff
 erence was 
seen in PTM incidence in the immediate and deferred radiotherapy groups (nine [9%] vs 16 [16%]; odds ratio 0·51 
[95% CI 0·19–1·32]; p=0·14). The only serious adverse event related to a PTM or radiotherapy was development of a 
painful PTM within the radiotherapy fi
 eld that required hospital admission for symptom control in one patient who 
received immediate radiotherapy. Common adverse events of immediate radiotherapy were skin toxicity (grade 1 in 
50 [54%] and grade 2 in four [4%] of 92 patients vs grade 1 in three [60%] and grade 2 in two [40%] of fi
 ve patients in the 
deferred radiotherapy group who received radiotherapy for a PTM) and tiredness or lethargy (36 [39%] in the immediate 
radiotherapy group vs two [40%] in the deferred radiotherapy group) within 3 months of receiving radiotherapy. 
Interpretation Routine use of prophylactic radiotherapy in all patients with mesothelioma after large-bore thoracic 
interventions is not justifi
 ed.

Introduction
Malignant pleural mesothelioma is an aggressive 
tumour with a poor prognosis, and few treatment 
options are available. In 2012, 2535 mesothelioma deaths 
were reported in the UK alone, and the incidence is 
predicted to increase.1,2 Patients often have multiple 
diagnostic and therapeutic pleural interventions to 
confi
 rm the diagnosis and manage symptomatic 
malignant pleural eff
 usions. However, a complication of 
these procedures is that the tumour can spread to the 
site of previous interventions, resulting in procedure-
tract metastases (PTMs). Data from a retrospective 
study3 suggest that the risk of these potentially painful 
nodules developing increases with the size of the chest 
wall incision.
Mesothelioma is sensitive to radiation therapy in vitro,4 
but its use as a radical treatment is limited by the dose 
that can be delivered safely to thoracic organs at risk. 
Prophylactic radiotherapy to pleural intervention sites 
can be given with minimal side-eff
 ects; however, results

from three small randomised controlled trials5–7 assessing 
its effi
  cacy in reducing PTMs are confl
 icting and 
showed substantial variation in PTM incidence. 
Three meta-analyses8–10 of these data concluded that there 
was insuffi
  cient evidence to recommend the use of 
prophylactic radiotherapy. Specifi
 cally, there is a paucity 
of data regarding the incidence of clinically relevant, 
symptomatic nodules. These factors have resulted in 
variation in clinical practice8,11 worldwide and in 
international guidelines;12–17 therefore, a suitably powered 
randomised controlled trial is needed.
The SMART trial aimed to establish whether immediate 
radiotherapy given within 42 days of a large-bore pleural 
intervention reduces the incidence of PTMs developing 
in mesothelioma, compared with deferred radiotherapy 
delivered only when PTMs develop. Additionally, we 
aimed to assess the diff
 erences in pain scores, analgesia 
requirements, quality of life, adverse events, and survival 
between the treatment groups.
Methods
Study design and participants
The SMART trial was a multicentre, open-label, phase 3 
randomised controlled trial that recruited consecutive 
patients from 22 hospitals in the UK (appendix). 
We recruited patients who had a histocytologically 
proven diagnosis of malignant pleural mesothelioma 
and had undergone (in the previous 35 days) an open 
pleural biopsy, surgical thoracotomy or video-assisted 
thoracoscopic surgery, local anaesthetic thoracoscopy, 
large-bore chest tube insertion (≥20 French [Fr] 
inserted by either a Seldinger technique or blunt 
dissection), or an indwelling pleural catheter insertion. 
The 35-day cutoff
  was extended from 28 days to improve 
patient recruitement after a protocol amendment 
accepted by the regional ethics committee on 
Aug 1, 2012.
Patients were ineligible if they were younger than 
18 years, had an expected survival of less than 4 months, 
were pregnant or lactating, were unable to give informed 
consent or comply with the protocol, had had previous 
radiotherapy resulting in an unacceptable overlap with 
the proposed treatment fi
 eld, had no access to a telephone, 
or had a clinically palpable nodule of 1 cm or larger in 
diameter within 7 cm of the margins of the procedure site 
at the initial trial visit.
The trial was sponsored by North Bristol National 
Health Service (NHS) Trust and coordinated by the 
Respiratory Research Unit at North Bristol NHS Trust. 
The trial and subsequent protocol amendments were 
approved by the South Central (Southampton B) Ethics 
Committee of the UK National Research Ethics Service 
(REC: 11/SC/0408). There was no data monitoring 
committee for the trial. The full protocol18 was published 
before the completion of trial follow-up. All patients 
provided written informed consent before recruitment.
Randomisation and masking
We randomly assigned patients (1:1) to receive either 
immediate prophylactic radiotherapy (within 42 days of 
the pleural intervention) or deferred radiotherapy (given 
if the patient subsequently developed a PTM). Treatment 
allocation was done over the telephone by the Oxford 
Respiratory Trials Unit, operated by staff
  independent of 
the study. The randomisation sequence was generated 
with a validated, online randomisation service (Sealed 
Envelope, London, UK). Minimisation with a random 
component was used to reduce the baseline diff
 erences 
between the two groups. The three minimisation factors 
were histological subtype of mesothelioma (epithelioid 
only vs other), pleural procedure (indwelling pleural 
catheter vs other), and nature of procedure (ie, open 
pleural biopsy, thoracotomy, or video-assisted thoraco-
scopic surgery vs non-surgical procedure).
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and AMED for 
articles published until Sept 16, 2015, that reported 
prophylactic radiotherapy in mesothelioma. We used the 
keywords “mesothelioma”, “neoplasms, mesothelial”, and 
“Prophylactic Radiotherap* OR irradiation OR radiation 
therapy”. We assessed titles, keywords, and abstracts, and 
obtained full texts of articles that we deemed relevant. 
We used the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme checklist to 
assess the quality of the evidence. We identifi
 ed three 
published randomised controlled trials and one additional 
randomised controlled trial that is still in the follow-up 
period. We found three systematic reviews incorporating 
evidence from randomised trials and non-randomised 
studies; all three reviews concluded that there was insuffi
  cient 
evidence to recommend prophylactic radiotherapy in 
mesothelioma and called for a large-scale randomised 
controlled trial to be done.
Added value of this study
Our results show that prophylactic radiotherapy to large-bore 
pleural intervention sites does not confer benefi
 ts in terms of 
the rate of procedure-tract metastasis (PTM), chest pain, quality 
of life, analgesia use, or survival.
Implications of all the available evidence
Taken together with results from the three previous 
randomised controlled trials, prophylactic radiotherapy is 
ineff
 ective in preventing PTMs in unselected patients with 
mesothelioma. Future studies should explore whether there is 
any benefi
 t of this treatment in specifi
 c patient subgroups—
eg, those not receiving chemotherapy and those with 
epithelioid-only tumour subtypes.

Patients and clinicians were not masked to treatment 
allocation; 
therefore, 
outcome 
assessments 
were 
unblinded. Data analysis was blinded from treatment 
allocation. The trial database was held at The Oxford 
Respiratory Trials Unit.
Procedures
Patients allocated to the immediate radiotherapy group 
received 21 Gy in three fractions over 3 working days, 
initiated within 42 days of the procedure for which the 
patient had been randomised. The target volume 
encompassed the chest drain, surgical sites or scars, 
and, in the case of indwelling pleural catheters, the 
whole of the catheter tract and skin exit site, with at 
least a 3 cm margin. The volume treated needed to have 
been acceptable to the treating clinical oncologist, and 
the treatment diameter and width needed to have been 
at least 7 cm. Further details of the radiotherapy 
protocol can be found in the published protocol.18 
The quality assurance programme for the trial is 
detailed in the appendix.
Patients in the deferred radiotherapy group received 
radiotherapy only if they were diagnosed with a PTM 
during trial follow-up. If a PTM was identifi
 ed, patients 
received 21 Gy of radiotherapy in three fractions over 
3 working days, delivered within 35 days of PTM 
diagnosis. The target volume encompassed the nodule 
with at least a 2 cm margin, and the treatment volume 
needed to have been acceptable to the treating clinical 
oncologist.
All patients were followed up monthly until death or for 
12 months. Patients visited the hospital at randomisation 
and at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after randomisation. 
Each hospital visit included a focused history (detailing 
radiotherapy toxicity, mesothelioma treatments received, 
analgesia use, and health-care use) and a chest wall 
examination by two independent assessors to identify 
PTMs and radiation toxicity. Patients also completed 
quality-of-life questionnaires (European Organization for 
Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality-of-Life 
Questionnaire—Core 30 [QLQ-C30] and EuroQoL-5D 
[EQ-5D]), a visual analogue scale score (on a scale of 
0–100 mm, with no pain at 0 mm and worst possible pain 
at 100 mm) for chest pain, and questionnaires about their 
experience of radiotherapy or the development of a PTM 
(if applicable). In the months that patients were not seen 
in person (ie, months 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, and 11), they instead 
received a telephone call from a research nurse to enquire 
about symptoms at the intervention site. They also 
completed a chest pain visual analogue scale score. 
If problems were identifi
 ed during a telephone 
consultation, a clinic appointment was arranged.
Patients recruited at Bristol and Oxford were off
 ered 
the opportunity to discuss their experience of the trial in 
a semi-structured, qualitative interview 6 months after 
trial entry.18 Common themes from analysis of these 
interviews will be identifi
 ed and reported separately. 
Patients were removed from the study only if they 
withdrew consent for ongoing trial follow-up.
Outcomes
The primary endpoint was the incidence of PTM within 
12 months from randomisation within the intention-to-
treat population. A PTM was defi
 ned as a clinically 
palpable nodule of at least 1 cm in diameter that was 
within 7 cm of the margins of the pleural intervention site, 
as confi
 rmed by two independent assessors (including at 
least one doctor who made a clinical diagnosis of tract 
metastasis). Disagreement was resolved by consensus. 
For patients who died or were lost to follow-up, their last 
known outcome was used for the analysis.
The predefi
 ned secondary outcomes were a per-
protocol analysis of the primary outcome (excluding 
patients with major protocol violations); summary chest 
pain visual analogue scale scores from randomisation to 
12 months after randomisation; summary quality-of-life 
score (as measured by QLQ-C30 and EQ-5D) from 
randomisation to 12 months after randomisation; 
analgesia requirements; the size, symptom severity, and 
time to development of PTM; incidence and severity of 
radiotherapy toxicity (according to the Radiation Therapy 
Oncology Group [RTOG] grading system19); the number 
of serious adverse events related to radiotherapy or a 
PTM; overall survival in days from randomisation to 
death; the health economics of immediate and deferred 
radiotherapy; and the identifi
 cation of emergent themes 
pertaining to patient experience from the semi-structured 
interviews. 
Statistical analysis
The sample size calculation was based on internal audit 
data from our regional mesothelioma multidisciplinary 
team (unpublished data) of PTM rates in those 
undergoing large-bore procedures and the published 
literature that was available at the time of the grant 
application. Assuming a PTM incidence of 2% in the 
immediate radiotherapy group and 15% in the delayed 
radiotherapy group, 185 patients were required to show a 
diff
 erence between treatment groups with 90% power 
(two-sided p=0·05), allowing for a 3% loss to follow-up. 
Results from various power modelling scenarios showed 
that the recruitment of 203 patients would allow 
adequate power with varied control and intervention 
event rates.18 The study was powered to address the 
primary outcome only, and not the secondary endpoints. 
The full analysis plan was published before any data 
assessment or database lock.18
We analysed the primary outcome in the intention-to-
treat population, using a Fisher’s exact test to compare 
PTM incidence between the treatment groups. We did 
several predefi
 ned subgroup analyses for the primary 
outcome, including analyses split by type of pleural 
intervention, histological subtype, survival to 6 months, 
and receipt of chemotherapy.18 In our secondary,

predefi
 ned, per-protocol analysis, we included only 
patients with no major protocol violations, defi
 ned as 
failure to give immediate radiotherapy to those 
randomised to this treatment group, failure to meet the 
eligibility criteria for the study, or a major violation to 
the immediate radiotherapy protocol—specifi
 cally, 
giving less than 21 Gy in three fractions, giving 
radiotherapy more than 42 days after the pleural 
intervention, or using a radiotherapy fi
 eld size less than 
that stipulated in the protocol.
Full details of the analysis of the secondary outcomes 
can be found in the statistical analysis plan.18 Where 
numbers allowed, the analyses were adjusted for the 
minimisation factors and the parameter measured at 
baseline (if the data were continuous). For longitudinal 
data, an area under the curve was calculated using the 
trapezium rule, and this was divided by the duration of 
follow-up to give a summary score, which was used for 
the analysis. Time-to-event data were analysed using the 
Kaplan-Meier method. Hazard ratios and 95% CIs were 
calculated by fi
 tting a Cox model. Safety outcomes were 
assessed in all patients who received radiotherapy. Safety, 
toxicity, and patient experience outcomes were reported 
descriptively. Only serious adverse events related to a 
PTM or radiotherapy were reported, as per the original 
trial protocol. The incremental cost-eff
 ectiveness ratio 
was calculated as the diff
 erence in mean costs (immediate 
radiotherapy minus deferred radiotherapy) divided by 
the diff
 erence in mean quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs; 
immediate radiotherapy minus deferred radiotherapy).
Stata (version 14) was used for statistical analyses. 
This study was registered with ISRCTN, number 
ISRCTN72767336.

Results
Between Dec 23, 2011, and Aug 4, 2014, we assessed 
457 patients for eligibility, and 203 patients were 
subsequently randomised and included in the primary 
analysis (fi
 gure 1). Baseline characteristics between the 
two groups were well matched, with no substantial 
diff
 erences identifi
 ed between the groups (table 1). 
The number of patients followed up until death or for 
12 months was 97 (95%) in the immediate radiotherapy 
group (three [3%] did not attend and two [2%] withdrew) 
and 94 (93%) in the delayed radiotherapy group (six [6%] 
did not attend and one [1%] withdrew). The median 
duration of follow-up was 343 days (IQR 201–370) in the 
immediate radiotherapy group and 349 days (212–370) in 
the deferred radiotherapy group. In the overall study 
population, 91 (45%) patients were randomised following 
a video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery, 74 (36%) after a 
local anaesthetic thoracoscopy, 25 (12%) following an 
indwelling pleural catheter insertion, nine (4%) after a 
thoracotomy, and three (1%) following large-bore chest 
drain insertion (table 1). One patient in the immediate 
radiotherapy group was randomised in error following 
a CT-guided pleural biopsy but was included in the 
primary analysis on an intention-to-treat basis.
99 of 102 patients in the immediate radiotherapy group 
received the radiotherapy as assigned (three deteriorated 
clinically 
between 
randomisation 
and 
treatment 
precluding irradiation; fi
 gure 1). All 99 patients received 
radiotherapy of 21 Gy in three fractions, delivered using 
6–18 meV electrons (85 [87%]), Kv photons (11 [11%]), 
Mv photons (two [2%]), or unknown (one [1%]; appendix). 
97 (98%) patients were treated with a single direct beam, 
one patient was treated with parallel pair tangents, and 
one had missing data. 60 (61%) had bolus administered, 
38 (38%) had no bolus, and one had missing data.

immediate radiotherapy group had CT-guided biopsy 
and was randomised more than 35 days after the pleural 
intervention, and fi
 ve patients [three in the immediate 
radiotherapy group and two in the deferred radiotherapy 
group] were randomised more than 35 days after the 
pleural intervention); three patients did not have the 
assigned immediate radiotherapy because of clinical 
deterioration; eight had an immediate radiotherapy fi
 eld 
size smaller than that stipulated in the protocol; and 
three had the fi
 rst fraction of immediate radiotherapy 
given more than 42 days after their pleural intervention. 
Four patients in the immediate radiotherapy group who 
developed a PTM were excluded from the per-protocol 
analysis (in three cases, the fi
 eld size was too small and 
one patient was randomised 36 days after the pleural 
intervention; appendix).
The secondary per-protocol analysis showed that PTM 
incidence was signifi
 cantly lower in the immediate 
radiotherapy group than in the deferred radiotherapy 
group (table 2). Most PTMs were identifi
 ed more than 
6 months from the pleural intervention procedure 
after which the patients were randomised (fi
 gure 2). 
No diff
 erence was seen in the time to development of 
PTM from randomisation between the treatment 
groups (p=0·34; table 2). Nine patients in the immediate 
radiotherapy group had PTMs (mean size of PTMs at 
diagnosis 3·1 cm [SD 2·9]), and 16 patients in the 
deferred radiotherapy group had PTMs (4·6 cm [2·6]; 
p=0·083). There were insuffi
  cient data for a formal 
analysis of how the size of the nodules changed over 
time. The minimum distance between the procedure 
site and the edge of the PTM was longer in the 
immediate radiotherapy group (mean 4·6 cm [SD 2·6]) 
than in the deferred radiotherapy group (1·3 cm [1·8]; 
p=0·0049). Four of the nine patients who developed a 
PTM in the immediate radiotherapy group did so more 
than 2 cm from the immediate radiotherapy fi
 eld. 
In addition to the 25 patients who developed a PTM 
within 7 cm of the site of pleural intervention procedure 
(meeting the primary endpoint criteria), a further 
four patients in the immediate radiotherapy group 
developed an ipsilateral chest wall nodule more than 
7 cm from the procedure site. No signifi
 cant diff
 erence 
was identifi
 ed in the total number of patients developing 
a chest wall nodule anywhere on the ipsilateral 
hemithorax (table 2). 
No diff
 erence was reported in chest pain, as assessed 
by visual analogue scale scores, in the two treatment 
groups at baseline and during trial follow-up (tables 1, 4). 
Additionally, no diff
 erence was seen between the groups 
in terms of analgesia use, as measured by oral morphine-
equivalent doses at baseline, or summary scores during 
trial follow-up (tables 1, 4).
Of the 25 patients who developed PTM, no 
diff
 erences were identifi
 ed in terms of the summary 
visual analogue scale scores or morphine-equivalent 
doses between the treatment groups (table 2). 
The numbers were too small for a formal survival 
analysis from the time of PTM diagnosis to death. 
Results of the chest wall lump questionnaire, 
completed by patients who developed PTMs, also 
revealed no diff
 erences in terms of patient experience 
between the treatment groups (appendix). Only 
eight patients (4% of 203 patients in the study; 32% of 
25 patients who developed a PTM) had PTMs that 
were tender at the time of identifi
 cation (table 2). 
The number needed to treat to prevent one painful 
PTM was 25·1. The proportion of PTMs that were 
painful was similar in the immediate radiotherapy 
group (two [22%] of nine) and in the deferred 
radiotherapy group (six [38%] of 16; odds ratio 0·48 
[95% CI 0·04–3·94]; p=0·66; table 2).
Quality of life of the two groups—as measured by the 
global health status, fatigue, pain, and appetite loss 
subscales of the QLQ-C30—was similar at baseline and 
during trial follow-up, both in terms of interval change 
from baseline to 1 month and in terms of the overall 
summary score during trial follow-up (tables 1, 4). 
No diff
 erence in quality of life was identifi
 ed at baseline 
or during trial follow-up by the summary scores derived 
from the EQ-5D utility scores (table 4).
Median overall survival from randomisation was 
357 days (95% CI not estimable) in the immediate 
radiotherapy group and 365 days (not estimable) in the 
deferred radiotherapy group (fi
 gure 3).
Immediate radiotherapy was generally well tolerated 
both in terms of side-eff
 ects and in terms of patient 
experience (table 5; appendix). There were no 
treatment-related deaths or withdrawals. Only one 
serious adverse event related to a PTM or radiotherapy 
was 
reported: 
one 
patient 
in 
the 
immediate 
radiotherapy group developed a painful PTM within 
the radiotherapy fi
 eld that required hospital admission 
for symptom control 8 months after randomisation 
(table 5). Among patients who received immediate 
radiotherapy, common adverse events were grade 1

skin toxicity and tiredness or lethargy within 3 months 
of receiving radiotherapy (table 5). The relative 
incidence of indwelling pleural catheter complications 
was similar in the two groups (appendix). Of 93 patients 
in the immediate radiotherapy group who completed 
the patient experience questionnaire, 26 (28%) patients 
said that they found attending radiotherapy at least a 
little inconvenient, 27 (29%) reported that radiotherapy 
interfered with their usual activities, and 27 (29%) 
said that radiotherapy aff
 ected their quality of life 
(appendix). However, 84 (90%) patients said that they 
found attending radiotherapy at least a little reassuring 
(appendix). Five patients in the deferred radiotherapy 
group completed the post-radiotherapy questionnaire, 
and their experiences were comparable to those of the 
immediate radiotherapy group (appendix).
No signifi
 cant or meaningful diff
 erences were seen in 
mean total cost (£5475 [SD 703] in the immediate 
radiotherapy group vs £5473 [773] in the deferred 
radiotherapy group) or in mean QALYs (0·504 [SD 0·03] 
vs 0·516 [0·03]). The point estimate of the incremental 
cost-eff
 ectiveness ratio for immediate radiotherapy 
compared with deferred radiotherapy was –£85·19 per 
QALY. 
Discussion
Results from the SMART trial showed that, for patients 
with malignant pleural mesothelioma, treatment with 
prophylactic 
radiotherapy 
after 
large-bore 
pleural 
interventions does not reduce the incidence of PTM and 
confers no benefi
 ts in terms of symptom control, 
analgesia use, survival, or quality of life. To our 
knowledge, the SMART trial is the largest trial

assess the important patient-centred outcomes of pain 
and quality of life.
The overall incidence of PTM in this study was low, 
with 93 (91%) patients in the immediate radiotherapy 
group and 85 (84%) in the deferred radiotherapy 
group not developing a PTM during trial follow-up. 
No signifi
 cant diff
 erence in the incidence of PTM was 
seen between the treatment groups, despite our study 
being the largest so far and having recruited more 
patients than the three previous randomised controlled 
trials5–7 combined. This fi
 nding, along with the absence 
of any patient-centred, symptomatic benefi
 t conferred 
by immediate radiotherapy, suggests that even if 
prophylactic radiotherapy was mildly effi
  cacious if 
given to a large enough number of patients (number 
needed to treat to prevent a painful PTM 25·1), the 
patient-derived benefi
 t would be no better than careful 
clinical follow-up and treatment should a nodule 
develop.
Some potentially interesting fi
 ndings from the 
secondary subgroup analyses might warrant further 
investigation. The secondary per-protocol analysis, 
which 
excluded 
patients 
with 
serious 
protocol 
deviations, showed a diff
 erence in PTM incidence 
between the treatment groups. This fi
 nding highlights 
the possibility that if adequate radiotherapy is given 
according to our protocol, the rate of PTM might be 
reduced, but the clinical relevance of this and whether 
reliable delivery of such a protocol in real-world settings 
is feasible (in view of the number of protocol deviations 
in this trial) are unclear. Importantly, however, the lack 
of diff
 erence between the treatment groups in terms of 
any of the patient-centred outcomes (including pain 
and quality of life) and the low rate of occurrence of 
symptomatic nodules suggest that patients were not 
disadvantaged by an active surveillance strategy and 
prompt administration of radiotherapy in the event of a 
nodule being detected.
Two potential signals were identifi
 ed in the predefi
 ned 
subgroup analyses. The fi
 rst was a suggestion that 
immediate radiotherapy was eff
 ective in reducing PTMs 
in the subgroup of patients with epithelioid-only 
histological tumour subtypes, which is likely to refl
 ect the 
improved survival of this subgroup and hence an 
increased duration of potential benefi
 t from the treatment. 
Second, in the subgroup of patients who did not receive 
chemotherapy after trial enrolment, those who received 
immediate radiotherapy had a lower PTM rate than had 
those in the deferred radiotherapy group. This fi
 nding 
suggests potential benefi
 ts in terms of prevention of 
locoregional recurrence from chemo 
therapy in addition 
to the well established systemic benefi
 ts. It might also 
explain the results of a large retrospective case series20 
supporting a role for prophylactic irradiation of tracts, in 
which the proportion of patients receiving chemotherapy 
was signifi
 cantly lower in patients who did not receive 
immediate radiotherapy than in those who did. 
The results of the PIT study,21 a randomised controlled 
trial assessing prophylactic irradiation of tracts in 
mesothelioma, which is in its follow-up period at present, 
are awaited with interest. These results will allow 
combination of the available data from published studies 
to gain further insights into the role of prophylactic 
radiotherapy in mesothelioma, particularly in these 
potentially relevant subgroups identifi
 ed in our study.
Overall, the rate of symptomatic PTM in this study was 
low. Eight (4%) of 203 patients in the study had a tender 
nodule at presentation, and eight (32%) of the 25 patients 
who developed a PTM had a tender nodule, which is 
similar to the proportions in a previous study.6 
No diff
 erence was identifi
 ed between the treatment 
groups, again suggesting that prophylactic radiotherapy 
does not aff
 ect the development of symptoms from 
PTMs in this population. Only one patient, who was in 
the immediate radiotherapy group, required hospital 
admission for symptom control relating to a PTM.

Complication rates of indwelling pleural catheters did 
not seem to be aff
 ected by radiotherapy, suggesting that 
these catheters are a safe treatment in this context, 
although again we did not identify any benefi
 ts of 
delivering prophylactic radiotherapy in this subgroup of 
patients. However, it is reassuring that the catheters 
themselves were not adversely aff
 ected by radiotherapy 
treatment, suggesting that palliative radiotherapy could 
be safely administered to the region of an indwelling 
pleural catheter if necessary.
Immediate prophylactic radiotherapy in this population 
was not cost-eff
 ective, compared with deferred radio-
therapy for symptomatic treatment. If we assume that 
publicly funded health-care systems (eg, NHS in the UK) 
are willing to pay £30 000 for incremental health gains 
(ie, an additional QALY), then immediate radiotherapy 
compared with deferred radiotherapy in patients with 
malignant mesothelioma following large-bore chest 
procedure is estimated to be cost-eff
 ective only 40% of 
the time (data to be published in full in a separate paper). 
However, radiotherapy was generally well tolerated and 
the frequency of skin toxicity was low, despite the larger 
fi
 eld size used in this trial than in previous studies. Most 
patients who received immediate radiotherapy found it 
reassuring, although they did report some inconvenience 
associated with attendance for the radiotherapy sessions.
This study has several strengths. To our knowledge, it 
is the largest study so far and was suitably powered 
to investigate this important research question in 
mesothelioma. It was designed to be a pragmatic trial to 
assess prophylactic radiotherapy in mesothelioma in a 
real-world setting. We assessed several important 
patient-centred secondary endpoints that have not been 
previously studied. We followed up patients until death 
or for 12 months, ensuring that all PTMs were carefully 
identifi
 ed by independent examinations by two clinicians 
at each clinic visit, which is essential in view of the fact 
that many PTMs were identifi
 ed in the later months of 
trial follow-up. The SMART trial is also the fi
 rst to 
investigate the role of prophylactic radiotherapy since 
eff
 ective systemic chemotherapy has become available 
for mesothelioma and to assess its role in the context of 
indwelling pleural catheter use.
Potential limitations include the absence of blinding 
of participants or assessors, which would not have been 
possible within the trial budget. The failure rate of 
screening was high, predominantly because patients did 
not meet the trial’s eligibility criteria, which were all 
deemed important factors to ensure that the results 
were valid and robust. The number of protocol 
deviations, specifi
 cally those related to the delivery of 
immediate radiotherapy, could also be viewed as a 
limitation of this study. However, these deviations in 
compliance with the protocol are likely to refl
 ect 
real-world variation in practice and might be even more 
substantial outside the trial setting. The fi
 eld size of 
radiotherapy was selected on the basis of results from 
previous studies and what was deemed reasonable to 
minimise radiotherapy toxicity; however, it could be 
argued that an even larger, more superiorly confi
 gured 
fi
 eld might have been more eff
 ective.22 However, 
whether these more distant nodules represent true 
PTMs or local tumour invasion unrelated to the previous 
pleural interventions is impossible to distinguish, and 
selection of a practical and realistic radiotherapy 
protocol was deemed vital for the purposes of this study 
to make the results universally applicable. Few patients 
in the SMART trial had undergone large surgical 
procedures (eg, thoracotomies), and hence it is not 
possible to give a specifi
 c recommendation regarding 
prophylactic radio 
therapy in this group of patients.
Overall, our data do not support the use of routine 
prophylactic 
radiotherapy 
after 
large-bore 
pleural 
interventions for all patients with mesothelioma. 
Although some suggestion of benefi
 t was identifi
 ed in 
specifi
 c patient subgroups, the applicability of these 
fi
 ndings is limited by the small numbers. Therefore, 
more data from randomised controlled trials are needed 
before the use of prophylactic radiotherapy in these 
contexts can be fully established. No signifi
 cant diff
 erence 
was identifi
 ed in terms of PTM rate, chest pain, quality of 
life, analgesia requirements, or survival, and immediate 
radiotherapy was not cost-eff
 ective. Patients were not 
symptomatically 
disadvantaged 
by 
careful 
clinical 
follow-up and later radiotherapy should a PTM develop. 
Our fi
 ndings do not support routine use of prophylactic 
irradiation of tracts in mesothelioma, provided that the 
patient receives regular clinical follow-up to ensure 
symptoms are identifi
 ed and treated early.
