Background: Heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) affects 
up to 1 in 200 individuals in the United States, but atherosclerotic 
cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) outcomes of FH in the general US 
population have not been described. We therefore sought to evaluate long-
term coronary heart disease (CHD) and total ASCVD risks in US adults with 
an FH phenotype.
Methods: Using individual pooled data from 6 large US epidemiological 
cohorts, we stratified participants by low-density lipoprotein cholesterol 
level at index ages from 20 to 79 years. For the primary analysis, low-
density lipoprotein cholesterol levels ≥190 and <130 mg/dL defined the 
FH phenotype and referent, respectively. Sensitivity analyses evaluated the 
effects of varying the FH phenotype definition. We used Cox regression 
models to assess covariate-adjusted associations of the FH phenotype with 
30-year hazards for CHD (CHD death or nonfatal myocardial infarction) and 
total ASCVD (CHD or stroke).
results: We included 68 
565 baseline person-examinations; 3850 
(5.6%) had the FH phenotype by the primary definition. Follow-up across 
index ages ranged from 78 
985 to 308 
378 person-years. After covariate 
adjustment, the FH phenotype was associated with substantially elevated 
30-year CHD risk, with hazard ratios up to 5.0 (95% confidence interval, 
1.1–21.7). Across index ages, CHD risk was accelerated in those with the 
FH phenotype by 10 to 20 years in men and 20 to 30 years in women. 
Similar patterns of results were found for total ASCVD risk, with hazard 
ratios up to 4.1 (95% confidence interval, 1.2–13.4). Alternative FH 
phenotype definitions incorporating family history, more stringent age-
based low-density lipoprotein cholesterol thresholds, or alternative lipid 
fractions decreased the FH phenotype prevalence to as low as 0.2% to 
0.4% without materially affecting CHD risk estimates (hazard ratios up to 
8.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.0–61.6). 
conclusions: In the general US population, the long-term ASCVD 
burden related to phenotypic FH, defined by low-density lipoprotein 
cholesterol ≥190 mg/dL, is likely substantial. Our finding of CHD risk 
acceleration may aid efforts in risk communication.

h
eterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) af-
fects up to 1.5 million individuals in the United States, 
with an estimated prevalence of 1 in 250 to 1 in 
200.1–3 Importantly, for those who are recognized and 
treated, statin use is associated with significantly decreased 
atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) morbidity 
and mortality.4–7 However, it is estimated that <1% of FH 
cases in the United States have been diagnosed,7 and sub-
optimal treatment is common worldwide.2,8,9 The burden of 
ASCVD associated with undiagnosed or undertreated FH in 
the general US population is unknown.
Available ASCVD risk calculators specifically ex-
clude FH patients because participants with FH are un-
common in the community-based samples of asymp-
tomatic, middle-aged individuals commonly used for 
derivation of risk equations. Therefore, the equations 
cannot account for the lifetime exposure to extreme 
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels that 
FH patients experience.10 Several prior reports have 
estimated ASCVD risk in untreated FH,4,7,11–18 but 
various methodological factors limit their applica-
tion when considering FH patients in the general US 
population.19 These studies have largely used non-
US samples4,7,12–17 from referral-based clinic popula-
tions4,7,14,15 or a few kindred,11–13 sometimes including 
those with prevalent ASCVD,7,14–18 and small outcome 
numbers have not allowed adjustment for known ASCVD 
risk factors. At present, US population–based data on 
long-term outcomes in FH are lacking, and a recent 
American Heart Association statement called for re-
search that would more clearly define the natural his-
tory of this condition.20
We therefore sought to quantify the long-term (up to 
30 years) risks for coronary heart disease (CHD) and 
total ASCVD associated with an FH phenotype in the gen-
eral US population, including younger and older adults. 
We defined the FH phenotype primarily by LDL-C levels 
≥190 mg/dL, consistent with diagnostic criteria that 
maximize sensitivity.14,20–22 We pooled data from mul-
tiple large, population-based studies to ensure sufficient 
sample size for stable risk estimates. We hypothesized 
that compared with US adults with average LDL-C lev-
els, those with an FH phenotype would have significantly 
increased hazards for CHD, even after adjustment for 
other risk factors, and that the hazards for CHD associ-
ated with the FH phenotype would be greatest at the 
youngest ages.
MethODs
study Participants
Participants for this study were drawn from the 
Cardiovascular Lifetime Risk Pooling Project, which pools 
individual-level data from up to 22 large, population-based 
longitudinal cohort studies with at least 10 years of follow-
up for cardiovascular disease (CVD) events. Details of 
the inclusion of cohorts and pooling and harmonization of 
data are presented elsewhere23,24 and summarized in Table 
I in the online-only Data Supplement. Data sets from the 
Pooling Project that were included in the present analysis 
were required to have at least 1 baseline examination at 
which participants underwent direct measurement of serum 
lipids in addition to physiological and anthropometric vari-
ables. The following 6 cohorts were therefore selected: 
Framingham Heart Study (after 1968, when full lipid pro-
file assessment began),25 Framingham Offspring Study,26 
Cardiovascular Health Study,27 ARIC study (Atherosclerosis 
Risk in Communities),28 CARDIA study (Coronary Artery Risk 
Development in Young Adults),29 and NHANES III (National 
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III Mortality 
Study)30,31 (Table I in the online-only Data Supplement). 
Participants were excluded from the analysis if they had 
preexisting CVD (myocardial infarction [MI], stroke, or heart 
failure) before the initial included examination or if they were 
missing serum lipid data. For the primary analysis, partici-
pants using cholesterol medication at the index age were 
included, but a sensitivity analysis evaluated the effect of 
excluding this group. This project was approved by the 
Institutional Review Board at Northwestern University.
clinical Perspective
What is new?
• This is the first prospective evaluation of atheroscle-
rotic cardiovascular disease outcomes for adults 
with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia in 
the general US population. 
• Using individual pooled data from 6 epidemiological 
cohorts (68 
565 baseline person-examinations and 
1.2 million person-years of follow-up), we confirmed 
substantially elevated long-term (up to 30 years) 
risks for coronary heart disease and total athero-
sclerotic cardiovascular disease (including stroke) in 
US adults with a familial hypercholesterolemia phe-
notype, with acceleration of coronary heart disease 
risk by up to 20 to 30 years.
• The findings were independent of other risk factors 
and were consistent when various definitions of 
the familial hypercholesterolemia phenotype were 
used.
What are the clinical implications?
• Our results indicate that there is likely to be an 
important long-term burden of atherosclerotic 
cardiovascular disease in phenotypic but unrec-
ognized familial hypercholesterolemia patients in 
the United States, and current efforts to identify 
patterns and gaps in diagnosis and management 
are well justified.
• Our findings on risk acceleration also have implica-
tions for risk communication in that clinicians can 
use our data to provide patients with a vivid, per-
sonalized risk message in the discussion about 
guideline-supported therapies.

lipid and covariate Measurements
Detailed protocols for lipid measurement and demographic 
and traditional risk factor assessment have been published 
for each cohort.25–30 Serum cholesterol levels, including total 
cholesterol (TC), triglycerides, and high-density lipoprotein cho-
lesterol (HDL-C), were measured directly. LDL-C was calculated 
with the Friedewald equation for individuals with triglycerides 
<400 mg/dL.32 Non–HDL-C was calculated as the difference 
between TC and HDL-C. Age, sex, race/ethnicity, smoking sta-
tus, diabetes status, hypertension treatment, cholesterol treat-
ment, and family history of CVD were determined by self-report. 
For these data, answers other than “yes” were assumed to be 
“no.” Diabetes mellitus was also considered present if fasting 
blood sugar was ≥126 mg/dL or diabetes medication use was 
reported. Blood pressure was determined from the average of 
2 to 3 measurements taken in participants while seated with a 
mercury sphygmomanometer.
Fh Phenotype and referent Definitions
We selected definitions of the FH phenotype that align with 
commonly used criteria to identify possible FH14,21,22 and the 
simplified diagnostic criteria for FH proposed in the recent 
American Heart Association statement: LDL-C ≥190 mg/dL 
plus a first-degree relative with similar degree of hypercho-
lesterolemia or with premature CHD.20 For the primary analy-
sis, we defined the FH phenotype simply as LDL-C ≥190 mg/
dL to maximize sensitivity for the condition, recognizing the 
limitations of self-reported family history data9,33 and chal-
lenges in harmonizing family history data between cohorts 
(Table I in the online-only Data Supplement). In a sensitivity 
analysis, we defined it as LDL-C ≥190 mg/dL plus a family 
history of CVD, that is, participant-reported history of CHD 
or stroke in either parent. In another sensitivity analysis, we 
restricted the definition further to require family history of 
premature CVD, that is, participant-reported first CHD inci-
dent or stroke at ≤55 or ≤60 years of age in the father or 
mother, respectively. These family history data were avail-
able only for CARDIA and ARIC participants (Table I in the 
online-only Data Supplement); thus, prevalence estimates 
involving family history include only these 2 cohorts. The ref-
erent group for these analyses was defined by LDL-C <130 
mg/dL; this level is near recent US population means34 and 
historically has been a target for primary prevention. The 
third (middle) group included all participants who met criteria 
for neither the FH phenotype nor referent group (ie, LDL-C 
130–189 mg/dL for the primary analysis; LDL-C 130–189 
mg/dL or negative/missing family history with LDL-C ≥190 
mg/dL for the sensitivity analyses).
Additional sensitivity analyses were performed with vary-
ing definitions of the FH phenotype also used by expert 
panels, including MEDPED (Make Early Diagnosis to Prevent 
Early Death),35 the Simon Broome Register,14 and the National 
Lipid Association.21 For the MEDPED analysis, age-based 
thresholds for the general population defined the FH pheno-
type for all participants: ≥220 mg/dL for 20 to 29 years of 
age, ≥240 mg/dL for 30 to 39 years of age, and ≥260 mg/
dL for 40 to 79 years of age. The referent was defined by 
LDL-C <130 mg/dL. The MEDPED criteria are expected to 
maximize specificity for molecular FH while sacrificing sensi-
tivity (98% and 54% in the derivation sample, respectively).35 
For the TC-based analysis, the FH phenotype was defined by 
TC ≥290 mg/dL, with the additional requirement for posi-
tive family history in a further analysis.14 The referent was 
TC <200 mg/dL. For the non–HDL-C–based analysis, the FH 
phenotype was defined by a composite of non–HDL-C ≥220 
mg/dL or LDL-C ≥190 mg/dL, with the additional require-
ment for positive family history in a further analysis.21 The 
referent was defined by non–HDL-C <220 mg/dL and LDL-C 
<130 mg/dL.
Outcome ascertainment
CHD events included CHD death and nonfatal MI. ASCVD 
events additionally included ischemic stroke. Events were 
ascertained according to each cohort’s specific protocol. 
Except for NHANES III, all studies adjudicated fatal and nonfa-
tal events using standardized clinical criteria.27,28,36,37 NHANES 
III ascertained CHD death and ASCVD death using International 
Classification of Diseases, Ninth Edition or 10th Edition, 
codes primarily from death certificate data through linkage 
to the National Death Index; nonfatal events were not ascer-
tained.31 Participants in NHANES III contributed 4.3% to 19.5% 
of the total baseline person-examinations at each index age 
(19.5%, 16.2%, 8.2%, 4.3%, 6.6%, and 10.0% for index ages 
of 20–29, 30–39, 40–49, 50–59, 60–69, and 70–79 years, 
respectively).
statistical analyses
To understand the effects of the FH phenotype on CVD out-
comes across the life course, we examined 30-year risk from 
different index (baseline) ages: 20 to 29, 30 to 39, 40 to 49, 
50 to 59, 60 to 69, and 70 to 79 years. Analyses were by 
person-examination (using the earliest study examination within 
the index age range) and were independent for each index age; 
thus, a given participant could contribute baseline and follow-
up data for multiple index ages if he or she remained free of 
CVD and had lipids remeasured at the later ages. We stratified 
person-examinations into the 3 groups (FH phenotype, refer-
ent, and middle group) according to lipid levels (and family his-
tory). Available follow-up data were collected from the index 
examination until the occurrence of a first CVD event, death, 
or completion of 30 years. The date of last available follow-up 
data ranged from 1999 to 2010 for individual cohorts (Table I 
in the online-only Data Supplement).
We made comparisons across the 3 lipid groups for each 
index age. We compared baseline characteristics using gen-
eral linear regression models for continuous variables and 
χ2 tests for categorical variables. We assessed risk for the 
primary outcome of CHD death or nonfatal MI and second-
ary outcomes of CHD death alone and total ASCVD (including 
fatal/nonfatal stroke). CHD, rather than ASCVD, was chosen 
as the primary outcome because the data relating LDL-C to 
stroke are not consistent.38 We calculated unadjusted event 
rates per 1000 person-years of follow-up for men and women 
separately. We used Cox proportional hazards regression to 
assess the association of the FH phenotype with outcome 
events, adjusting for cohort and for sex, age, race/ethnicity, 
body mass index, systolic blood pressure, hypertension treat-
ment, cholesterol treatment, diabetes status, smoking status, 
and HDL-C level. We also generated Cox adjusted 30-year, 
event-free survival curves. We tested proportional hazards

assumptions and found them to be appropriate. We examined 
the interactions of sex and race (black/nonblack) with LDL-C 
level on the outcome and found no significant interactions; 
we therefore present pooled sex- and race-adjusted results. 
However, we also performed Cox models separately by sex 
and race to examine whether patterns of association differed 
qualitatively. Finally, we calculated the proportion of incident 
CHD for the total cohort that would occur among those with 
the FH phenotype independently of other CVD risk factors: We 
multiplied the complement of the 30-year Cox adjusted sur-
vival probabilities (ie, the event probabilities) by the calculated 
prevalence of each LDL-C group, summed them to generate a 
weighted estimate of total event probability for the cohort, and 
divided the individual group CHD event estimates (ie, the prod-
uct of prevalence and 30-year event probability) by this total 
event probability estimate to give the proportion of CHD occur-
ring in that LDL-C group. For all comparisons, a 2-tailed value 
of P<0.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical 
analyses were performed with SAS statistical software version 
9.4 (SAS Institute, Inc), and the PROC PHREG procedure was 
used to compute Cox proportional hazard regression models.
resUlts
Participant characteristics
Baseline characteristics of the FH phenotype and referent 
groups stratified by index age are shown in Table 1 and 
Table II in the online-only Data Supplement. (Table III in the 
online-only Data Supplement shows baseline characteris-
tics separately by sex.) With the use of the primary defini-
tion, the FH phenotype (LDL-C ≥190 mg/dL) group con-
tributed 3850 baseline person-examinations and made up 
1.4% to 7.9% of the overall cohort at each index age. 
The prevalence most closely approached the reported FH 
prevalence of 0.4% to 0.5% at the youngest index ages 
but was substantially higher for older index ages. Across 
the index ages of the FH phenotype group, the mean LDL-
C level was 210 to 214 mg/dL, and family history of CVD 
was reported in 33% to 46%. Compared with the referent 
group with LDL-C <130 mg/dL, those with the FH pheno-
type had a higher burden of other CVD risk factors on av-

erage (Table 1 and Table II in the online-only Data Supple-
ment). There were low levels of cholesterol treatment at 
baseline, ranging from 0% to 7.9% for the FH phenotype 
group (significantly higher than for the referent group only 
at index ages of 30–39 and 40–49 years).
long-term chD risk associated With the Fh 
Phenotype, Defined by lDl-c ≥190 mg/dl
Figure 1 shows the unadjusted event rates and underlying 
observed event numbers for men and women in the FH 
phenotype and referent groups across index ages. Unad-
justed event rates were similar for men and women with 
the FH phenotype for the index age of 20 to 29 years, 
but for older index ages, the rates in men were almost 
double those in women. Conversely, age-based accelera-
tion of CHD risk compared with the referent group was 
greater for women than for men. For men with the FH 
phenotype (Figure 1A), the event rates for each index age 
were generally equivalent to those for men with average 
LDL-C (ie, <130 mg/dL) who were 10 to 20 years older, 
indicating that CHD risk was accelerated by 10 to 20 
years. For example, the event rate for 20- to 29-year-old 
men with the FH phenotype was 2.6 per 1000 person-
years, which was equivalent to the rate for men between 
30 to 39 years of age (1.5 per 1000 person-years) and 
40 to 49 years of age (4.0 per 1000 person-years) with 
average LDL-C. A similar pattern was evident for women 
with the FH phenotype (Figure 1B), but for women, CHD 
risk was accelerated by 20 to 30 years.
Table 2 (left) shows the hazards for CHD death or nonfa-
tal MI associated with having the FH phenotype compared 
with an average LDL-C level after adjustment for cohort, 
sex, and baseline covariates. The hazards for CHD in the 
FH phenotype group were age dependent, with an up to 
5-fold increased risk for the index age of 20 to 29 years, 
lower relative hazards at older ages, and a nonsignificant 
increase in risk for the index age of 70 to 79 years. Ex-
clusion of participants taking cholesterol medication at 
baseline did not significantly affect the findings (results 
not shown). There was no significant interaction between 
sex and LDL-C level on the hazard ratios for the FH phe-
notype, but at younger index ages, hazard ratio point 
estimates were higher for women than for men (Table 2, 
right). There was also no significant interaction between 
race (black/nonblack) and LDL-C level on the hazard ra-
tios, and hazard ratios were comparable between race 
groups (Table IV in the online-only Data Supplement).
Figure 2 shows adjusted 30-year event-free survival 
curves for each index age. The survival curves for the FH 
phenotype group diverge progressively from those for 
the referent and middle groups, particularly for younger 
index ages.

Death alone or total ascVD associated With the 
Fh Phenotype, Defined by lDl-c ≥190 mg/dl
In the analyses focusing on the outcomes of CHD death 
alone (Table V in the online-only Data Supplement) and 
total ASCVD (Table VI in the online-only Data Supplement), 
results approximated those for the primary outcome of 
CHD death or nonfatal MI. Hazard ratios were similar, 
Figure 1. Unadjusted rates of coronary heart disease death or nonfatal myocardial infarction per 1000 person-
years and underlying observed event numbers in (a) men and (B) women.  
Unadjusted event rates are graphed by index age and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) category; LDL-C ≥190 mg/dL 
represents the familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) phenotype, and LDL-C <130 mg/dL represents the referent. For men (a), event 
rates in the FH phenotype group at any given age are equivalent to those for men in the referent group who are 10 to 20 years 
older, indicating acceleration of coronary heart disease (CHD) risk by 10 to 20 years. For women (B), CHD risk is accelerated by 
20 to 30 years. The tables below each graph show observed event numbers for the FH phenotype and referent groups by sex 
and index age.

and the width of the confidence intervals varied with the

prevalence (0.5%–3.3%) more closely approached the 
reported FH prevalence (0.4%–0.5%), and adjusted haz-
ard ratios for CHD events approximated those in the 
primary analysis, with slightly higher point estimates but 
overlapping confidence intervals (Table 3). When the FH 
phenotype definition was further restricted to require 
family history of premature CVD, the prevalence of this 
group declined further (0.1%–0.8%), but again, the pat-
tern of CHD risk was unchanged (results not shown; too 
few events for stable risk estimates). When MEDPED 
LDL-C criteria were used to maximize the specificity for 
molecular FH, the prevalence of the FH phenotype was 
0.2% to 0.4%. CHD risk was qualitatively more strik-
ing in this analysis, with higher hazard ratio point esti-
mates and statistical significance for even the oldest 
index age; however, confidence intervals were wide and 
overlapped those for the primary analysis (Table 3). 
When the FH phenotype was defined by alternative lipid 
fractions (TC or non–HDL-C), patterns were again un-
changed (Table 3).
Population impact: Proportion of total cohort 
chD related to the Fh Phenotype, Defined by 
lDl-c ≥190 mg/dl
Table 2 also shows the proportion of incident CHD for the 
total cohort at each index age projected to occur in those 
with the FH phenotype independently of other CVD risk 
factors. For the combined group of men and women, that 
proportion is more than double the prevalence of the FH 
phenotype for younger index ages. The disproportionate 
CHD burden is more prominent for women than for men. 
For the index age of 20 to 29 years, 8.1% of CHD events 
in women would occur in the 1.4% of women with the FH 
phenotype, whereas 3.3% of CHD events in men would 
occur in the 1.5% of men with the FH phenotype.
DiscUssiOn
This analysis provides novel information about the risks 
of CHD and total ASCVD (including stroke) associated 
with having the FH phenotype in a broad US population–
based sample. The principal finding is that the long-term 
CHD and ASCVD risks for US adults with the FH pheno-
type, defined simply by LDL-C ≥190 mg/dL, are substan-
tially elevated (up to ≈5-fold) compared with those with 
average levels of LDL-C, even after adjustment for other 
CVD risk factors. This increased risk is age dependent, 
with the highest relative risks seen for younger index 
ages. Moreover, across the spectrum of baseline (index) 
ages, individuals with the FH phenotype experience an

acceleration of CHD risk by 10 to 20 years in men and 
20 to 30 years in women. The addition of family history 
or use of maximally specific LDL-C criteria or alternative 
lipid fractions to define the FH phenotype did not materi-
ally affect the pattern of results, although power was 
limited for some analyses.
Findings in context
Prior reports have examined the natural history of FH 
in specific settings and found substantial, although vari-
able, elevation of CHD and stroke risk, with risk patterns 
similar to those in the present analysis. For example, age 
dependency of risk has previously been observed in FH 
patients such as in the Simon Broome Register,14 just 
as it is observed in the general population38 (in which it 
probably reflects a higher genetic contribution to hyper-
cholesterolemia that develops earlier in life). In the UK 
referral clinic patients in the Simon Broome Register, the 
overall risk for CHD death was 3.9 times that in the gen-
eral population, but age-specific relative risk was 97 for 
20 to 39 years of age and was not increased for ≥60 
years of age. This age dependency is likely related to 
both accumulation of risk in the referent group with aging 
and survivor bias, with survival of lower-risk FH patients 
to older ages with the higher-risk patients having suc-
cumbed at younger ages. Similarly, acceleration of risk 
in FH patients has been observed previously. Stone et al18

and (F) 70 to 79† years.  
Over 30 years of follow-up, event-free survival is progressively worse for the familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) phenotype group 
(low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C] ≥190 mg/dL) than for the other 2 groups. Baseline mean±SD LDL-C levels for the LDL-C 
<130 mg/dL (referent), 130 to 189 mg/dL, and ≥190 mg/dL (FH phenotype) groups were (a) 20 to 29 years: 96±20, 148±15, and 
213±38 mg/dL; (B) 30 to 39 years: 98±20, 150±15, and 210±24 mg/dL; (c) 40 to 49 years: 100±21, 152±16, and 213±28

and Jensen et al12 demonstrated acceleration of risk for 
MI or CHD death by 14 to 20 years in men and women 
with FH compared with unaffected relatives. Finally, Stone 
et al also found greater relative risks for women than 
for men, a finding that was suggested by our analysis, 
although it did not reach statistical significance. Notably, 
in both studies, the greater relative risks for women are 
observed despite higher absolute risks in men and there-
fore are largely a result of the lower-risk referent group in 
women compared with men.
The numeric risk estimates in this analysis differ from 
those in some prior reports, but when marked differ-
ences exist, they can likely be explained by differences 
in study methodology. For example, the Simon Broome 
report was based on a referral population in which 32% 
of participants had prevalent CVD at registration, and 
no adjustment was made for other CVD risk factors.14 In 
contrast, the present analysis benefited from a large US 
population–based sample, including a substantial pro-
portion of blacks, and risk estimates were fully adjusted. 
These are important distinctions because prior studies 
clearly indicate a wide range of CHD risk among those 
with FH, likely as a result of genetic factors and gene-en-
vironment interactions.9,11,13 Our findings therefore may 
provide unique information about the burden of disease 
for the broader group with the FH phenotype, including 
those who remain undiagnosed.
limitations
Some limitations to our study design may have led to 
underestimation of the risk for CHD and ASCVD in mo-
lecularly or clinically diagnosed FH. First, because our aim 
was to estimate risk related to FH in the general popula-
tion, we had to rely on a “phenotype” rather than genetic 
diagnosis. Although we used criteria used clinically for 
diagnosis, we relied on a single LDL-C measurement, did 
not rule out secondary causes of hypercholesterolemia 
(eg, thyroid disease, nephrosis), and had limited fam-
ily history data. Therefore, we almost certainly included 
some individuals with polygenic or secondary LDL-C eleva-
tion, as evidenced by a higher-than-expected prevalence 
of the FH phenotype (defined by LDL-C ≥190 mg/dL), 
especially at older ages. Importantly, when we required 
positive family history or used the stringent MEDPED LDL-
C criteria to define the FH phenotype, the risk estimates 
did not change significantly, although power was limited. 
Second, although our results were unchanged after we ex-
cluded individuals using cholesterol-lowering medication 
at baseline, we could not identify or account for initiation

of therapy during follow-up. The vast majority of our data 
were collected before the widespread use of statins, but 
whatever statin use existed would lead to underestimation 
of risk for the natural history of FH. Third, 1 of the 6 in-
cluded cohorts, NHANES III, recorded mortality outcomes 
only. To the extent that nonfatal MI or stroke occurred 
without subsequent ASCVD death during follow-up in this 
cohort, risk for the combined outcomes of CHD death or 
nonfatal MI and total ASCVD would be underestimated. 
However, given that the NHANES III cohort contributed a 
minority (4.3%–19.5%) of person-examinations, this effect 
is probably small. Finally, as with any population-level risk 
estimates, our data likely underestimate risk for certain in-
dividuals such as the higher-risk patients presenting to re-
ferral centers with significant personal or family histories.
implications
The present study has important public health implica-
tions in that it confirms the substantial elevation in ASCVD 
risk for adults with the FH phenotype in a US population–
based sample. Notably, this is true even when the simple 
threshold of LDL-C ≥190 mg/dL is used to identify the FH 
phenotype, which provides support for the simplified FH di-
agnostic criteria proposed in the recent American Heart As-
sociation statement.20 In combination with prior work sug-
gesting the vast underdiagnosis of FH,2,9 our data indicate 
that there is likely to be an important long-term burden of 
ASCVD in phenotypic but unrecognized FH patients in the 
United States. This is consistent with international reports 
that the prevalence of FH among young patients with MI 
may be many times higher than the prevalence of FH in the 
general population, from ≈2% to 4% of patients <60 years 
of age3,39 to almost 20% in patients <45 years of age.39 In 
light of this amplification of FH prevalence among those with 
CHD, economic modeling in the United Kingdom has shown 
that identification and treatment of FH patients are not only 
cost-effective but cost-saving.8 Several recent publications 
have emphasized the need for improved screening for and 
awareness and care of FH in the United States,2,8,10,20,40 
and through the ongoing CASCADE-FH registry (Cascade 
Screening for Awareness and Detection of Familial Hyper-
cholesterolemia), the FH foundation is working to identify 
patterns and gaps in diagnosis and management.9 Our find-
ings support the importance of this work.
Our data also have clinical implications for risk com-
munication. Building on prior reports, we confirmed that 
FH patients not only have a higher risk for CHD but also 
have a shift in that risk toward younger ages. Clinician-
patient discussions about guideline-supported therapies 
can be informed by this information, as in the following 
scenario: A 25-year-old woman with newly diagnosed FH 
can be informed that at her current age, if her choles-
terol were to remain untreated, her risk of CHD death 
or nonfatal MI is comparable to that for a 55-year-old 
woman. Such an analogy, paired with counseling about 
how to improve risk, may motivate behavioral changes 
and the adoption of and adherence to evidence-based 
medications.41
