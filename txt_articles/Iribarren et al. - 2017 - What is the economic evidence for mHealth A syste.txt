Abstract
Background
Mobile health (mHealth) is often reputed to be cost-effective or cost-saving. Despite opti-
mism, the strength of the evidence supporting this assertion has been limited. In this sys-
tematic review the body of evidence related to economic evaluations of mHealth
interventions is assessed and summarized.
Methods
Seven electronic bibliographic databases, grey literature, and relevant references were
searched. Eligibility criteria included original articles, comparison of costs and conse-
quences of interventions (one categorized as a primary mHealth intervention or mHealth
intervention as a component of other interventions), health and economic outcomes and
published in English. Full economic evaluations were appraised using the Consolidated
Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) checklist and The PRISMA
guidelines were followed.
Results
Searches identified 5902 results, of which 318 were examined at full text, and 39 were
included in this review. The 39 studies spanned 19 countries, most of which were conducted
in upper and upper-middle income countries (34, 87.2%). Primary mHealth interventions
(35, 89.7%), behavior change communication type interventions (e.g., improve attendance
rates, medication adherence) (27, 69.2%), and short messaging system (SMS) as the
mHealth function (e.g., used to send reminders, information, provide support, conduct sur-
veys or collect data) (22, 56.4%) were most frequent; the most frequent disease or condition
focuses were outpatient clinic attendance, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. The aver-
age percent of CHEERS checklist items reported was 79.6% (range 47.62–100, STD 14.18)

 and the top quartile reported 91.3–100%. In 29 studies (74.3%), researchers reported that
the mHealth intervention was cost-effective, economically beneficial, or cost saving at base
case.
Conclusions
Findings highlight a growing body of economic evidence for mHealth interventions. Although
all studies included a comparison of intervention effectiveness of a health-related outcome
and reported economic data, many did not report all recommended economic outcome
items and were lacking in comprehensive analysis. The identified economic evaluations var-
ied by disease or condition focus, economic outcome measurements, perspectives, and
were distributed unevenly geographically, limiting formal meta-analysis. Further research is
needed in low and low-middle income countries and to understand the impact of different
mHealth types. Following established economic reporting guidelines will improve this body
of research.
Introduction
Globally, mobile phone subscribers have grown from less than 1 billion in 2000 to more than 7
billion in 2015, corresponding to a penetration rate of 97% worldwide [1]. Capitalizing on this
widespread use of mobile phones, researchers and implementers have used them as a catalyst
for healthcare change to address disparities and inequities in health service access and delivery,
geographic barriers, shortage of health care providers, and high health care costs [2, 3]. Mobile
health (mHealth) is defined as the “medical and public health practice supported by mobile
devices, such as mobile phones, patient monitoring devices, personal digital assistants (PDAs),
and other wireless devices” [4]. Ideally, mHealth improves health outcomes by, for example,
efficiently and effectively increasing patient knowledge about a disease/condition, providing
social support to those undergoing challenging treatment regimens of stigmatizing diseases,
enhancing patient-provider communication, or improving communication and coordination
across multidisciplinary care teams thereby improving quality of care delivery [5].
In addition to establishing the effectiveness of these interventions it is also crucial to under-
stand their economic impact given the growing recognition across the globe that resources are
finite. Economic evaluations can guide policymakers and funders in determining whether evi-
dence supports wider adoption of mHealth interventions [6]. Such evaluations identify and
compare alternative interventions, and assess incremental impact on health outcomes and
their costs (differences between intervention under study and comparator intervention) [7].
mHealth is often assumed to be or described as cost-effective or cost-saving, yet the
strength of the evidence supporting this assertion has been limited [8–10]. Despite optimism,
unknown cost-effectiveness has been listed as one of the top six barriers to mHealth imple-
mentation [4] and as a key factor in limited mHealth policy investment [11]. There are a num-
ber of ways in which mHealth interventions may reduce health care costs including, but not
limited to, decreasing transportation costs for patients or healthcare workers, addressing inef-
ficient practices, decreasing time to diagnosis, keeping patients in their home longer versus
costly health care facilities, or reducing hospital visits [12]. Prior systematic reviews of eco-
nomic evidence of technology-based interventions have focused on telehealth/telemedicine,
[13, 14] electronic health (eHealth) and/or specific diseases or populations,[15–18] or a

 combination of telehealth, eHealth, mHealth [10]. Therefore, to our knowledge, no studies
focused on understanding the potential economic impact of mHealth interventions broadly.
The aim of this review was to summarize and assess the body of evidence related to economic
evaluations of mHealth interventions.
Methods
The methods for reviewing economic evaluations included (1) applying explicit inclusion cri-
teria to select studies; (2) developing a data abstraction form and characteristic categories to
record individual study characteristics; (3) evaluating the quality of reporting of each study
using the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) state-
ment checklist [19]; and (4) interpreting and summarizing the identified economic evaluations
based on study questions. Questions included: What economic evaluation of mHealth inter-
ventions evidence is currently available? What types of mHealth interventions have undergone
economic evaluations? What economic evaluation methods were used? What patient popula-
tion, disease, or health outcomes are targeted? In what settings is research being conducted? Is
there any evidence of the cost-effectiveness of mHealth interventions? If so, what is the quality
of reporting the economic evidence? Of the identified studies, how many report that the inter-
vention economic outcomes were positive (e.g., cost-effective, economically beneficial, or cost
saving) at base case? The protocol for this systematic review was registered in PROSPERO
(CRD42014014913) (www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/). We followed the Preferred Reporting
Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines for this report [20].

Finding and selecting relevant studies
Search strategy.
Seven electronic bibliographic databases including MEDLINE (Ovid),
EMBASE (EMBASE.com), CINAHL, The Cochrane Center Register of Controlled Trials
(CENTRAL), NHS Economic Evaluation Database (NHS EED), Database of Abstracts of
Reviews of Effects (DARE), and PsycInfo (Ovid) were searched to April, 2016. Subject head-
ings and text words that encompassed the concepts of mobile health and economic evaluations
were used. Search strategies were developed and run by an information specialist (LF). The
search strategies are provided in Supporting Information S1 Appendix. Clinicaltrials.gov and
WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform were searched for ongoing trials and
sites such as mHealth Evidence, OpenGrey, HIMSS website were searched for grey literature
from October—December, 2015. We further searched the cited references and reference lists
of included studies (through ISI Web of Science) and relevant systematic reviews by hand to
identify additional relevant studies.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria.
We included original articles published in English that
compared the costs and consequences of at least two interventions, one of which was a
mHealth intervention. mHealth interventions could be either the primary intervention or a
component of an intervention. We excluded studies not meeting mHealth criteria such as tele-
health with stationary devices (e.g., desktop videophone, desktop computer, videoconferenc-
ing equipment) unless they reported also using mobile devices (e.g., mobile phone or sensors),
were web-based only, or were devices for clinical diagnosis (e.g., EEG) that did not report on a
health outcome. We excluded reviews or commentaries of economic evaluations. Protocols for
planned economic evaluations of mHealth interventions were identified and included in sum-
mary of study characteristics but excluded from the full analysis. While we classified and
reported the number of partial economic evaluations identified, which measure only costs of

 an intervention without comparator (e.g., cost accounting of intervention, cost per patient or
cost per an event), these provide limited insight [20].
Study selection process.
We used a web-based database management system, Early
Review Organizing Software (EROS) for data management, developed by the Institute for
Clinical Effectiveness in Argentina, to facilitate screening, identify and resolve discrepancies,
and to produce the flow diagram. Two reviewers (SI, KC) screened the titles and abstracts of
the retrieved records independently and excluded obviously irrelevant records. Full text arti-
cles were obtained for studies of possible inclusion for further evaluation. Final decisions
were based on the consensus of both screeners. A third reviewer (PS) was included when
uncertainty regarding eligibility arose. Authors of published research protocols and confer-
ence proceedings were contacted for final report, economic data, or estimated date of
publication.
Development of data abstraction form and study characteristic
categories
The data extraction form was developed in MS Excel to capture data for 48 study characteris-
tics based on data points of reviews of economic evaluation [13, 15] and study questions. The
data points included the type of economic evaluation, mHealth intervention type, mHealth as
the primary intervention versus combined with other intervention strategies, target disease/
condition, country, economic outcomes, costs, effectiveness and funding.
mHealth applications have been categorized in different ways. For example, the mHealth
Compendium outlines five main categories of mHealth types or applications (e.g., behavior
change communication, data collection, finance, logistics, and service delivery), [21] while oth-
ers use six [22] or twelve categories [5]. To code the mHealth intervention type we used five
categories of mHealth interventions and provide definitions and examples of what each
include in Table 1. We selected the primary mHealth type with the understanding that other
application categories may also be applicable. Often interventions integrate two or more types
of mHealth applications (e.g., text message, app) to address a health need or health system con-
straints [22]. Country income level was classified according to the 2015 World Bank 4 ratings
categories (Low income (LIC), lower-middle-income (LMIC), upper-middle-income econo-
mies (UMIC), upper income country (UIC)) [23].
There are several types of comprehensive economic evaluations methods including: cost
minimization, cost-consequence, cost-effectiveness, cost-utility (i.e., a special type of cost-
effectiveness analysis) and cost-benefit analysis [7, 24]. Each type of evaluation compares the
costs of alternative strategies but vary in how effectiveness is measured [24]. Outcomes of full
economic evaluations include estimates of cost and effectiveness, incremental cost effective-
ness ratio (ICER), cost per life saved, disability adjusted life year (DALY), quality adjusted life
year (QALY), time-savings gained, and measurement and comparisons of healthcare costs
(e.g., costs for buying, implementing, running, representative monetary conversion factors,
cost of mobile phone access and provision, and healthcare utilization) [8]. Consequences of
health interventions can be evaluated using a number of approaches, for example, a single ana-
lytical study, a synthesis of studies, mathematical modeling, or a combination can be used to
estimate health consequences [19]. Interpretation of results should reflect the constituents rep-
resented and is influenced by assumptions and values used to conduct the evaluation [25].
These assumptions include, for example, the perspective, time horizon, data source, and at
which ‘threshold’ an intervention may be considered cost-effective in a given country or set-
ting—such as $50,000 per Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY) or considering the prevalence
or severity of the condition studied. Study outcomes reporting intervention at base case as

 cost-effective, economically beneficial, or cost saving were coded as having a positive costing
outcome or not [Y/N].
Quality of reporting assessment
To optimize the reporting of economic evaluations, a relatively new checklist of 24 items was
developed through expert consensus, the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting
Standards (CHEERS) statement [19]. Items include reporting target population, time horizon,
discount rate, source of effectiveness and cost data, and currency, for example. This checklist
has been endorsed by the ISPOR Health Economic Evaluations Publication Guidelines Task
Force and co-published across 10 health economics and medical journals to improve reporting
and, in turn, health and health care decisions. Full economic evaluations were evaluated for
quality of reporting using the CHEERS statement by two authors independently (SI, KC) as a
measure to assess risk of bias of reporting economic outcomes [19]. Any discrepancies were
resolved with a third reviewer (PS). Although there is no standard, universally accepted
method of critical appraisal of economic evaluations, there are several points of methodologi-
cal quality that can be considered [25]. We used the quantity of reported CHEERS items and
considerations described by Henrikson et al (2013) to discuss study quality.

 Interpreting and summarizing economic evaluations
Findings were summarized and reported based on our study questions: number of economic
evaluation of mHealth interventions; mHealth interventions types; economic evaluation meth-
ods; disease/condition focus; country where conducted; reporting quality; and evidence of the
positive costing outcomes (e.g., cost-effective, economically beneficial, or cost saving) at base
case. Disparate study designs, intervention type, study context, patient population, and types
of economic analysis meant that formal meta-analysis was inappropriate. For this reason, we
present a descriptive analysis of the studies included. For data points without predefined cate-
gories, as described above, we first free texted study characteristics and then recoded by group-
ing similar themes (e.g., similar disease/condition focus areas, similar costing perspectives). To
summarize reporting quality we (1) categorized highest quality studies as the top 25th percen-
tile (reporting 90–100% of the recommended items CHEERS guideline items); (2) reported
most items missing from being reported, and (3) discussed quality evaluation based on the
CHEERS assessment domains. To gain insight into what mHealth interventions showed
promise, studies categorized as reporting positive costing outcome (eg. cost-effective, econom-
ically beneficial, or cost saving) at base case were reported by category in study characteristic
summary table.
Results
Literature search and evaluation for study inclusion
The searches yielded a total of 8826 results. Subsequent searches in the grey literature and
screening through Web of Science resulted in an additional 459. Of the 5902 studies screened
after deduplication and excluding those clearly outside inclusion criteria, 318 were screened
full text, and 39 economic evaluations were included. Of those excluded from final analysis
were 30 protocols with planned economic evaluations and 18 classified as partial economic
evaluations. Other reasons for exclusion are described in the PRISMA flow diagram (Fig 1).
Study characteristics
The number of published mHealth economic evaluations increased since 2012 (Fig 2). No full
economic evaluations were identified up to the 2016 screening date. Of the 30 identified proto-
cols 6 were published in 2013, 8 in 2014 and 16 in 2015. Eight corresponding authors of pub-
lished protocols reported that their study was in progress and/or expected publication late
2016–2017.
Table 2 provides a summary of the study characteristics and corresponding number of stud-
ies with reported costing outcomes categorized as positive (e.g., cost-effective, economically
beneficial, or cost saving). Most reported positive costing outcomes at base case (26, 74.3%).
The 39 studies spanned 19 countries, the majority of which were conducted in upper and
upper-middle income countries (34, 87.2%) compared to 5 in lower-middle or low-income
countries (12.8%). Of these 70.6% and 100% reported positive costing outcomes, respectively.
The majority evaluated an mHealth intervention as the primary intervention (35, 89.7%) ver-
sus as a component of an intervention (4, 10.3%), both categories with about three quarters
reporting positive costing outcomes. Twenty seven of the 39 studies used a behavior change
communication type interventions (e.g., improve attendance rates, medication adherence)
(27, 69.2%) with high rates of reported positive costing outcomes (20, 74.1%). SMS was the
mHealth function most often used in the interventions (e.g., used to send reminders, informa-
tion, provide support, conduct surveys or collect data) (22, 56.4%) with 17 (77.3%) resulting in

 reported positive economic outcomes. The most frequent disease or condition focuses were
outpatient clinic attendance, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes.
Cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) was the predominant economic evaluation method (25,
64.1%) and cost utility analysis (CUA) had the highest within group positive costing out-
comes (10, 83.3%). The costing perspective was mostly from the payer/health service

 provider/program/employer perspective; however, a large number did not clearly report the
costing perspective (16, 41%).
Quality of reporting of full economic evaluations (CHEERS)
Supporting Information S2 Appendix provides the evaluation of each study by CHEERS item
checklist. Table 3 summarizes the CHEERS items missing when expected for all studies. The
average percent of items reported in the studies was 79.6% (range 47.62–100, STD 14.18). The
five items most likely not to be reported were: characterization of heterogeneity (29, 74.4%);
characterizes uncertainty—sensitivity of incremental costs (single study-based) (17, 61.7%);
identifying the study as an economic evaluation in the title (19, 48.7%); stating currency, price
date, conversion (18, 46.2%); and stating study perspective (16, 41%).
Twelve (30.7%) of the full economic evaluations reported greater than 90% of the CHEERS
items, ranking them in the 25th percentile, thus are considered of higher reporting quality [26–
37]. Supporting Information S3 Appendix provides a summary of these studies intervention
comparators, time horizon, discount rate, outcomes and findings. These studies were all pub-
lished between 2012 and 2016, whereas the publication dates of those not consistent with
CHEERS items ranged from 2005 to 2015. Of the economic evaluations reporting the highest
CHEERS items, nine (75%) were behavior change communication type based interventions
using text messaging as the primary intervention to send reminders or support [28–32, 34, 36,
37] or an app [35]. Two were service delivery based using an app to replace surgical follow-up
visits [27] and an iPhone based sensor for screening [33, 27]. One was primarily for data collec-
tion using a personal digital assistant (PDA) [26]. There was a range of disease/condition
focuses, for example, tuberculosis control,[31] diabetes prevention and management, [26, 36]
and malaria management [37]. Most were CUA (8, 66.7%), the remainder were CEA. Of these
studies, 4 used primary RCT as their effectiveness data source [28, 30, 34, 37] and 5 drew from
prior RCT or multiple studies [27, 29, 31, 32, 36]. Eleven used usual care, current practice or a
control group not receiving intervention as the comparator intervention and one used medica-
tion self-administration as the comparator group [31]. The interventions and comparators for
top 25th percentile reporting are listed in Appendix B and Appendix C summarizes studies by
mHealth type. Five applied a lifetime time horizon [29–31, 33, 36] while others used four years

 or less. The majority applied a discount rate of 3–5% (Add definition of what a discount rate
is) (9, 75%) [26, 28–33, 36]. Only two calculated costs based on a societal perspective [27, 30].
All conducted sensitivity analyses.
In contract, in the lowest 25th percentile (n = 11), 5 used RCT data [38–41] while others
used effectiveness data from pilot or observational studies [42–47]. However, none reported
the study perspective or characterized heterogeneity, and only one [48] included sensitivity
analyses. Study duration for all were reported as under 6 months, therefore, not requiring dis-
count rates [48].
Protocols with planned economic evaluations
Twenty-eight of the protocols of mHealth based interventions describe full economic evalua-
tions (five from the grey literature). Of these, one is a primary CEA, one is a prospective cohort
study with planned CEA, another is a fractional factorial design with CEA and the remaining
are RCTs with CEA. Two were categorized as partial economic evaluations (e.g., cost account-
ing, and partial and direct costs). One focuses on data collection mHealth intervention type, 7
focus on service delivery and the majority focus on behavior change communication based inter-
ventions (26, 87%). The focus conditions vary widely. For example, six will focus on HIV and
four each on diabetes, physical activity, and pulmonary issues. Other topics include risk reduc-
tion of binge drinking, self-harm, and injury prevention.

Economic evaluations facilitate the comparison between interventions in terms of their costs
and consequences and can be used to guide decision makers or funders in determining if
mHealth-based interventions improve health outcomes relative to other existing interventions
and if the cost to adopt and maintain the intervention in a system or setting is justified [49].

 mHealth guidelines recommend the use of economic evaluation tailored reporting standards,
such as the CHEERS checklist, for full economic evaluations and support the reporting of
basic costs assessment of the mHealth intervention from varying perspectives [50]. In our sys-
tematic review, we provide a summary of the economic evidence of mHealth and confirm the
common criticism that cost-effectiveness is often assumed, without evidence to support it. In
fact, of the excluded studies during screening, 57% included statements of cost-effectiveness or
cost in the abstract or title but upon further evaluation did not provide enough detail to be
considered a partial or full economic evaluation. However, we did identify more economic
evaluations of mHealth than expected given findings from prior reviews [10, 15]. Our review
provides an overview of full economic evaluations and highlights a growing number of pub-
lished planned economic evaluations. Findings show a diverse range of mHealth interventions,
focus conditions, and types of mHealth tools used in the interventions evaluated for economic

 impact. The majority evaluated mHealth as the primary intervention (versus a component of
the intervention) and were conducted in upper and upper-middle income countries.
All studies included a comparison of effectiveness of a health-related outcome and reported
economic data. However, many did not report all recommended economic outcome items,
were not titled/reported as a full economic evaluation, or did not calculate a summary mea-
sure. To ensure transparency the authors should provide detail of data sources, assumptions
made regarding modeling of data, funding source, and the role of the funder in the analysis
and reporting of the study [25]. Over half reported 80% or less of the recommended criteria.
Regardless of the quality of reporting, overall there was consistent reporting of positive eco-
nomic outcomes (e.g., increase in life years gained, cost savings, cost-effectiveness) across
mHealth type and cost calculation perspectives. Although findings from this review support
cost effectiveness of mHealth interventions, this result must be considered with caution. It is
important to evaluate case by case and additional research is needed to identify mHealth com-
ponents that contribute most to positive outcomes.
Selecting the most appropriate methodology and data collection strategy is important to
increase the transferability of findings across economic evaluations [6]. The source of data
from randomized control trials or a rigorous prospective cohort study are considered high
quality while expert opinion is of low quality due to risk of bias [25]. How outcomes are mea-
sured is another quality consideration. High quality outcomes use reliable and validated
instruments and/or clinical endpoints (e.g., disease specific) and state how they were calculated
and ideally sample people affected by condition or from a general community population [25].
Research designs, sample sizes, and economic reporting quality varied. Three of the studies
were pilot study designs,[42, 43, 46] and had small sample size which lack economies of scale
(which would indicate the intervention may be even more cost saving) or lack volume (which
would indicate more utilization that may increase costs). Some of these studies did not self-
report as formal cost-effectiveness studies and instead, for example, reported methods of cost
outcome analyses [32, 51]. Additionally, others reported outcomes of effectiveness and differ-
ence in costs compared with other interventions or modeled multiple scenarios. Various
assumptions about modeling may introduce risk such as using poor quality studies or data
that does not reflect current practice that may favor one intervention over the other [25]. For
example, Moore et al., assessed effectiveness of a technology supported intervention to support
management of hypertension and compared costs between intervention and standard care,
identifying cost savings [52]. Similarly, O’Leary et al., evaluated text messaging to increase vac-
cination outcomes and reported cost scenarios [53]. However, neither calculated a summary
measure such as an incremental cost-effectiveness. In another example, Chang et al., calculated
costs per outcome averted (e.g., virologic failure and patient lost to follow-up averted) of a
peer health worker intervention compared with mHealth supported peer health workers inter-
vention to report patient clinical data to centralized staff. Their findings were based on thresh-
old analyses to identify costs to avert an unwanted outcome and the associated cost savings
[54]. Costs and savings were also calculated for implementation at large-scale based on pilot
study findings [51]. Efficiency was used as a measure of cost-effectiveness. For example,
Bingna et al., defined efficiency as improvements in the primary efficacy outcome relative to
the staff working time used and the direct financial costs of the intervention [38]. Cost-effec-
tiveness evaluations were often secondary outcomes or reported in results. Koshy [43] and Per-
ron et al., [40] reported the cost-effectiveness methods within results and discussion sections.
Similarly, Loranzo-Fuentes et al., reported cost-effectiveness as a primary study aim, but briefly
described the cost analysis methods in the result section [45]. Downer et al., modeled financial
benefits that could result from increasing outpatient attendance using text messaging and
although the authors report the methods as cost-effectiveness, it was classified as a cost benefit

 analysis because the outcome was measured as cost per success and the reported cost differ-
ence was in monetary units [55]. However, several of the CHEERS quality items were not
reported in this study. Joo et al., reported the short intervention period prohibited the calcula-
tion of QALYs as a limitation [56].
To be conservative, we reported results as positive or probable cost-effectiveness if one or
more of the primary outcomes showed a positive economic outcome. There were cases where
secondary outcomes had increased likelihood of cost-effectiveness for an intervention. For
example, Maddison et al., identified a mobile phone intervention as not cost-effective com-
pared with usual care for the primary outcome of exercise capacity; however, there were results
of cost-effectiveness for secondary outcomes [34]. Similarly, some studies reported the inter-
vention as not cost-effective at base case. However, as the number of patients treated increased,
the treatment became less expensive. For example, at approximately 1600 users the app evalu-
ated by Luxton et al., became less expensive than in-office treatment [57]. Furthermore,
because of the large number of potential app users, an estimated $USD 2.7–2.9 million societal
savings was calculated. The estimates of probability falling below a recognized value threshold
for the cost per QALY gained varied based on access to existing software [58].
A main objective of medical research is to improve the health of a population; therefore,
conducting economic evaluations from a societal perspective is preferred [59]. The study per-
spective, such as patient, payer, provider, health systems each take into consideration differing
costs and outcomes. A societal perspective is considered high quality because it includes both
full direct and indirect costs, such as direct costs to patients and opportunity costs regardless
of who bears the costs or receives the effects [25]. Since research is expensive and exposes
patients to the risk of experimentation, it is important to think beyond effectiveness of the
intervention and to take into consideration the potential to incur opportunity costs [49]. Only
two full economic evaluations reported analyses from a societal perspective [27, 30]. Both of
these studies also ranked within the top 25th percentile of CHEERS items reported, represent-
ing good quality economic evaluations. Those with lower quality score often did not describe
the perspective. In such cases from the costs calculated it can often be assumed that the per-
spective is from the intervention implementer and sometimes the patient or service user costs
are also included. Some studies included a mix of perspectives (e.g., provider or health care
sector and service user) or at various levels of implementation (e.g., start up, regional level,
national level). Similarly, although the majority of the studies included the currency used in
their analyses, of those categorized as not reporting the CHEERS item ‘currency, price date,
and conversion,’ most failed to include the date or year the costs were calculated. The lack of
this information limits reviewers’ ability to convert and compare to other similar studies. In
addition, time horizon was not reported in about a quarter of the studies. A time horizon takes
into account preferences for future benefits over immediate benefits and applies a discount
rate, typically 3 and 5%. A high-quality study will use a time horizon of over ten years [25]. In
evaluations of response rate or clinic attendance, it seems appropriate to use a short time hori-
zon. However, for behavior change interventions, e.g., smoking cessation or adherence to
medication for a chronic disease, longer time horizons may be necessary.
As technology based interventions and mHealth, in particular, are relatively new it is not
feasible to wait for lifetime data to validate cost-effectiveness. Consequently, it is not surprising
that many of the identified economic evaluations used modeling techniques to simulate disease
projections over a lifetime or long period while incorporating effectiveness and cost evidence.
In so doing it is important to calculate and represent uncertainty [60]. For a study to be consid-
ered high quality sensitivity analyses are needed to evaluate factors that most influence results
and failing to account for the range of adverse events can induce bias [25]. There are a number
of methods used to explore uncertainty in economic evaluations (e.g., one-way and multiway

 sensitivity analyses, threshold analyses, analyses of extremes and probabilistic sensitivity analy-
ses) [49]. For the studies included in this review that applied a model-based economic evalua-
tion, all described the calculation and reported of uncertainty/sensitivity of incremental costs
and most used a Monte Carlo simulation for probabilistic sensitivity analysis. In contrast, for
single study-based economic evaluations, the uncertainty of sampling together with the impact
of methodological assumptions (e.g., discount rate, study perspective) was described in less
than half.
Behavior change communication interventions were the most represented mHealth inter-
vention type identified in our review. This finding is consistent with others reporting behavior
change communication interventions as the predominant and most successful of all mHealth
interventions [21]. No economic evaluations were found for three of the domains (human
resource management, financial transactions and incentives, and logistics/supply management).
Similarly, a review of mHealth in low- and middle-income countries by Hall et al., showed no
studies were identified as human resource management nor financial transactions and incen-
tives based interventions [61]. In addition, although mHealth is recognized as drawing from a
range of tools and often combined with other strategies,[5] the majority in our study assessed
mHealth tools as the primary intervention type and fewer as a secondary or combined compo-
nent. One exception was Joo et al., who assessed a remote type Internet based intervention
with twice weekly SMS prompts for behavior modifications in combination with other inter-
vention components [56].
Text messaging was the predominant tool assessed in the studies, consistent with mHealth
literature [21, 62]. Text-messaging interventions are popular because they can be sent, stored,
answered and retrieved at the user’s convenience; they are relatively inexpensive; and they are
available for any type of phone [61, 63–65]. Increasingly, SMS reminder systems are being
used by healthcare systems to counter the negative impacts of missed appointments, such as
lost revenue to the health care system, potential poor impact on patient health and treatment
outcomes, and system efficiency [66]. The largest number of identified economic evaluation
studies focused on assessing cost outcomes of SMS appointment reminders to increase outpa-
tient clinic attendance. All but one found positive economic outcomes [43]. In our review,
four focused on diabetes management or prevention, and each of these identified the interven-
tion as cost-effective. However, a systematic review of text messaging interventions concluded
that text messaging benefits are still unclear because most studies have used self-reported
adherence measures, omitted the measurement of clinical outcomes, and neglected to evaluate
beyond the active intervention period to determine lasting effects or to assess baseline adher-
ence difference [65, 67].
Apps are reported to be an ideal platform for behavior change because of their popularity,
connectivity, and increased sophistication [68]. Apps can support added functionalities
beyond, text messaging, for example. They have the potential for real-time data collection,
graphic feedback, interactivity, and links to social functionalities. In our review there were
apps identified as cost-effective for follow-up care for low-risk postoperative ambulatory
patients [27]. Telephone follow-up may decrease costs and time for follow-up care compared
with in-person, but requires synchronous communication and often multiple calls. In contrast,
mobile app follow-up can collect and relay data asynchronously and to those in need of evalu-
ating the information, such as surgeons [27].
Interventions to improve disease detection or point of care testing using mobile phone
based technologies is an area of mHealth considered to have high potential to increase access
to rapid testing and be cost savings [69, 70]. In our study, we identified an app to screen for
atrial fibrillation [33]. Authors have noted that widespread implementation remains subject to
several challenges and pending issues [70].

 Implications for researchers, health professionals, and policy makers
The increasing focus of economic evaluations of mHealth interventions means there is a need
for careful reporting and rigorous evaluation. This review highlights that there is moderate to
high quality of economic reporting, but that there is a lack of evaluations in low-middle and
low-income counties. And there is significant heterogeneity in terms of settings, costing strate-
gies, and length of follow-up periods, limiting the conclusions to be drawn. The high-quality
studies clearly described what was included in the costs and how they were calculated. We
encourage the use of the CHEERS checklist for reporting of economic evaluations and for
authors to refrain from including statements of cost-effectiveness in their findings in the
absence of an economic evaluation.
Limitations
We systematically searched mHealth research with economic evaluations and included multi-
ple cost outcomes in the developed search criteria. However, as reflected in the CHEERS evalu-
ation, less than half reported economic evaluation in the title and a clear cost outcome was not
always identified in the abstract. In abstracts including statements about a cost outcome, we
evaluated the full text for inclusion. Nonetheless, economic evaluations not mentioned in the
title or abstract may have been missed. Because we found a high percentage of the studies
reporting a positive outcome, it is possible that there may be a publication bias and fewer nega-
tive findings are being published. Articles not published in English were not included, which is
another limitation.
Conclusions
The body of economic evaluations of mHealth interventions is growing, evidencing research-
ers’ response to the call as one of mHealth’s major gaps in further implementation and scale
up. A number of the studies were rated as reporting high quality evidence and findings suggest
high rates of reporting positive costing outcomes using mHealth interventions compared with
usual care or other comparators. Although findings from this review support cost effectiveness
of mHealth interventions, this result must be considered with caution. It is important to evalu-
ate case by case. All studies compared intervention effectiveness on a health-related outcome
and reported economic data, however many did not report all recommended economic out-
come items and were lacking in comprehensive analysis. Further attention is needed to follow
established economic reporting guidelines to improve the body of evidence. Due to few simi-
larities in the interventions which precluded any quantitative synthesis such as, varied target
disease/condition focus, intervention comparators, economic outcomes measures and an
uneven geographical distribution, caution is needed in drawing a conclusion of economic evi-
dence of mHealth interventions to date. Further research is needed in low and low-middle
income countries to understand the impact of mHealth components that contribute most to
positive outcomes. The growing number of planned economic evaluations, along with
improved reporting and further targeted synthesis of economic evaluations, will help guide
policymakers and funders.
