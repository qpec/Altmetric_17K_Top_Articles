Abstract: Associations of low-to-moderate consumption of red and processed meat with mortality
would add to the evidence of possible adverse effects of these common foods. This study aims to
investigate the association of red and processed meat intake with mortality. The Adventist Health
Study-2 (AHS-2) is a prospective cohort study of ~96,000 Seventh-day Adventist men and women
recruited in the US and Canada between 2002 and 2007. The final analytic sample after exclusions was
72,149. Cox proportional hazards regression was used and hazard ratios (HR) and confidence intervals
(CI) were obtained. Diet was assessed by a validated quantitative food frequency questionnaire
(FFQ), calibrated using six 24-h dietary recalls. Mortality outcome data were obtained from the
National Death Index. During a mean follow-up of 11.8 years, there were 7961 total deaths, of which
2598 were Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) deaths and 1873 were cancer deaths. Unprocessed red
meat was associated with risk of all-cause mortality (HR: 1.18; 95% CI: 1.07–1.31) and CVD mortality
(HR: 1.26; 95% CI: 1.05–1.50). Processed meat alone was not significantly associated with risk of
mortality. The combined intake of red and processed meat was associated with all-cause mortality
(HR: 1.23; 95% CI: 1.11–1.36) and CVD mortality (HR: 1.34; 95% CI: 1.12–1.60). These findings suggest
moderately higher risks of all-cause and CVD mortality associated with red and processed meat in a
low meat intake population.

1. Introduction
Over the last fifty years, global meat consumption has increased in both developing and
developed countries [1]. In the United States, red meat is the most commonly consumed type of
meat; and processed meat represents approximately one-fourth of the total meat consumed [2]. Red
and/or processed meat have been associated with higher risk of coronary heart diseases (CHD) [3],
diabetes [3–5], and some forms of cancer [6].
Several studies have found positive associations between intake of red and/or processed meat and
total, cardiovascular disease (CVD), or cancer mortality [7–9]. These studies were mainly conducted
in populations with moderate to high levels of meat intake, leaving unanswered whether zero
consumption might correlate with even lower risk. The Adventist Health Study-2 (AHS-2) has a
large number of vegetarians, with even most nonvegetarians having low intakes of red and processed
meat [10]. Therefore, this analysis aims to investigate the association of such low intakes of red and
processed meat with all-cause, CVD, and cancer mortality.

2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Study Population
The Adventist Health Study-2 (AHS-2) has been previously described in detail [11]. It is a
prospective cohort study of approximately 96,000 Seventh-day Adventist men (~35%) and women
(~65%) recruited from Adventist churches in the United States and Canada between 2002 and 2007.
The cohort was formed primarily to study the possible effects of diet on cancer risk. The study was
approved by the Institutional Review Board of Loma Linda University, and written informed consent
was obtained from each participant upon enrolment.
For this analysis, exclusions were applied: missing dietary variables (n = 267); bad or inadequate
data (e.g., unlikely response patterns including clearly invalid and identical responses to questions in a
single page) (n = 507); missing more than 69 responses in the dietary section (2172); Canadian residents
(n = 4393); extreme values of total energy (e.g., <500 kcal/day or >4500 kcal/day) (n = 2044); missing
age, sex, or race (n = 538); age younger than 25 years at baseline (n = 8); and prevalent diseases related
to mortality outcomes (i.e., prevalent cancers (except nonmelanoma skin cancers) or prevalent CVD
defined as previous coronary bypass, angioplasty/stent, carotid artery surgery, myocardial infarction,
stroke, or transient ischemic attack (TIA); or angina pectoris or congestive heart failure treated in the
past 12 months) (n = 13,527). The analytic sample remaining was 72,149.
2.2. Assessment of Exposures
AHS-2 participants were requested at enrolment to complete a quantitative food frequency
questionnaire (FFQ) consisting of more than 200 food items. Unprocessed red meat intake was
reported as two items in the FFQ: “hamburger, ground beef (in casserole, meatballs, etc.)” and “beef or
lamb as a main dish (e.g., steak, roast, stew, and pot pies)”. Processed meat was reported as: “processed
beef, lamb (e.g., sausage, salami, and bologna)” and “processed chicken or turkey (e.g., turkey bologna,
and turkey ham)”. Pork was classified as processed meat because most of the pork products listed in
the single pork question in the FFQ were processed (i.e., “pork (bacon, sausage, ham, chops, ribs, and
lunch-meat)”). The frequency of intake ranged from “never or rarely” to “2+ per day”, and serving
sizes consisted of three levels (a half serving, standard serving (3–4 oz.), and one-and-a-half servings).
The assigned weights for frequency and serving size in the FFQ used in AHS-2 have been previously
described [12]. The intake in grams per day was calculated using the product-sum method [12,13].
The FFQ has been validated using six 24-h dietary recalls from a representative subset of the
original AHS-2 cohort [12]. The deattenuated validity correlations for all types of meat, poultry,
and fish combined were 0.86 and 0.85 for Whites and Blacks, respectively. Specifically, the validity
correlations for unprocessed red and processed meats were 0.74 and 0.43 for Whites, respectively, and
0.68 and 0.36 for Blacks, respectively [12].
2.3. Ascertainment of Outcomes
Mortality outcome data were obtained from the National Death Index and were available through
December 2015. International Statistical Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) codes were
used to determine the underlying cause of death. Individuals who died due to unnatural causes such
as motor vehicle accidents and homicides (ICD-10 letters U, V, W, X, and Y) were censored at their
time of death (i.e., they were not considered as cases in the analysis of all-cause mortality). ICD-10
codes for CVD mortality ranged from I00 to I78; cancer mortality ranged from C00 to C97.
2.4. Assessment of Covariates
Covariates were self-reported by questionnaire at enrolment, including information on
demographics, medical history (including obstetrical and gynecological history), family medical
history, socioeconomic factors, lifestyle factors, and diet. Covariates were selected a priori as possible
confounders (see Tables footnotes for covariates details).

2.5. Statistical Analysis
Time-dependent Cox-proportional hazards regression with attained age as the time variable
and left truncation by age at study entry, controlling for potential confounding covariates, was used
to assess the association between the consumption of red and processed meat and all-cause, CVD,
and cancer mortality. We used multiple imputation, guided where possible, for missing data [14,15],
in which the estimates were calculated from five imputed datasets, and then Rubin’s formula was
applied to obtain the average estimates and corrected standard errors [16]. We analyzed intakes of
unprocessed red and processed meats as continuous (log-transformed) variables measured in grams
per day (g/day) comparing the 90th percentile of intake with zero-intake. To assess for possible
common associations of unprocessed red and processed meats (which were highly correlated; R = 0.56),
we combined both variables by summing the daily intakes from unprocessed red meat and processed
meat together to create one single variable. Regression calibration of the exposures was used, where
reported, to minimize the possible bias in the association estimates due to measurement error [17,18].
Only exposures of interest (red and processed meat) were calibrated, not all dietary covariates. In this
procedure, a shortened version of the main questionnaire (limited to the dietary/FFQ portion), was
administered to a 1000-subject (equal allocation for Whites and Blacks) subsample of the AHS-2
cohort. The subsample was approximately representative of the AHS-2 cohort in terms of gender, age,
education, and vegetarian status [19]. Six 24-h dietary recalls were also collected from the subsample.
From this data, a linear model was produced, regressing the intakes of red and processed meats from
dietary recalls on the corresponding intakes from the food frequency questionnaire, controlling for
the respective covariates present in each analytic model. The coefficients of the exposures of interest
(red and processed meats) from the linear model were used to predict calibrated intake values from
the intake values obtained from the FFQ of the original cohort. That is, predicted 24-h recall intake
values produced by a linear model regressing intake values from the 24-h recalls against those from
the FFQ, adjusted for the analytic covariates, are used in the analytic models to produce calibrated
effect estimates. These calibrated intake variables were then used in the analytic models to produce
calibrated hazard ratios. A 4000-round bootstrap was used to produce bias-corrected and accelerated
(BCa) confidence intervals for these hazard ratios. We also conducted analyses using five categories
of intake (i.e., a zero-intake group plus quartiles of consumers). Linear trends across the categories
were tested by assigning the medians of intake in each quartile to all participants in that quartile and
analyzing them as continuous variables. Also, we assessed the linearity of the relationship between the
exposures and mortality outcomes using 4-knot restricted cubic spline regression. Dietary exposures
and covariates were energy-adjusted using the residual method [20].
We tested for interaction of the exposures of interest with age, sex, and race. Other covariates
were also tested for possible interactions with the exposures, and for possible interactions with each
other where suspected. We separately conducted subgroup analyses by sex and race, in which we
used sex- and race-specific ranges and values of intakes for the exposures. Further, we conducted
separate analyses on those who reported they never smoked in order to address the effect of residual
confounding by smoking in the original models. The proportional hazards assumption of the model
was assessed using log(−log) plots, Schoenfeld residuals, and attained-age interaction terms; there
was no violation. We also calculated population attributable risk comparing the 90th percentile of the
combined intake of red and processed meat (~49 g/day) with zero-intake (assuming causality) [21].
SAS (version 9.4; SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, CA, USA) was used to perform the main analyses of the study.
R (version 3.5.1 software; a Language and Environment for Statistical Computing; R Foundation for
Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) [22] was used for multiple imputation (package “Hmisc”) [23],
spline regression (package “rms”) [24], and regression calibration (package “boot”) [25].
3. Results
During a mean follow-up of 11.8 years, there were 7961 deaths, of which 2598 were due to CVD
and 1873 were due to cancers. Compared with zero-intake subjects, those with the highest intake of

unprocessed red meat were younger, less educated, and less physically active. They also had higher
prevalence of current smoking, alcohol use, and slightly higher BMI. Regarding dietary characteristics,
they tended to have lower intakes of cruciferous vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes, and nuts
and seeds, and higher intakes of dairy, eggs, unprocessed poultry, and processed meat (Table 1).

1 Quartiles based on percentiles of the energy-adjusted g/day intake of unprocessed red meat among the total
cohort. Median quartiles (g/day) are as follows, Q1 = 4, Q2 = 9.1, Q3 = 15.6, and Q4 = 41.7. 2 Exercise defined as
“vigorous activities, such as brisk walking, jogging, bicycling, etc., long enough or with enough intensity to work
up a sweat, get your heart thumping, or get out of breath”. 3 Percentages were calculated among women only.
4 Current hormone replacement therapy users among postmenopausal women only. * SD: Standard deviation.
Consumption of red and processed meat were associated with the risk of total, CVD, and cancer
mortality among the total cohort when adjusted for age, sex, race and total energy intake (model 1,
Table 2) when using all forms of the exposure (e.g., quartiles of intake versus zero-intake, p-trend,
and both uncalibrated and calibrated 90th percentiles versus zero-intake). The associations were
attenuated yet remained significant for total and CVD mortality, but not cancer mortality in the
multivariable models without adjustment for other meats (model 2). In the multivariable model with
mutual adjustment for other meats (model 3), participants in the 90th percentile intake of unprocessed
red meat (compared with zero-intake) had a higher risk of all-cause mortality (uncalibrated, HR:
1.18; 95% CI: 1.07–1.31 and calibrated, HR: 1.51; 95% CI: 1.22–1.98; p < 0.001) and CVD mortality

Processed meat alone was not significantly associated with risk of mortality when adjusted for other
meats. Red and processed meat (combined) were associated with higher risk of all-cause mortality
(uncalibrated, HR: 1.23; 95% CI: 1.11–1.36 and calibrated, HR: 1.50; 95% CI: 1.26–1.83; p < 0.001) and
CVD mortality (uncalibrated, HR: 1.34; 95% CI: 1.12–1.60 and calibrated, HR: 1.73; 95% CI: 1.27–2.51;
p < 0.001) (Table 2).
Results from subgroups are presented as forest plots, where 90th percentiles versus zero-intake
contrasts were used (Figure 1). Unprocessed red meat was significantly associated with risk of
all-cause mortality among women (HR: 1.17; 95% CI: 1.03–1.33), men (HR: 1.21; 95% CI: 1.03–1.43), and
non-Blacks (HR: 1.20; 95% CI: 1.06–1.34), but not among Blacks (HR: 1.18; 95% CI: 0.96–1.45); with CVD
mortality among women (HR: 1.30; 95% CI: 1.03–1.64), but not men (HR: 1.15; 95% CI: 0.93–1.79), and
among Blacks (HR: 1.69; 95% CI: 1.18–2.40), but not non-Blacks (HR: 1.17; 95% CI: 0.95–1.43). Processed
meat was associated with all-cause mortality among women (HR: 1.17; 95% CI: 1.03–1.32), but not
men (HR: 0.99; 95% CI: 0.84–1.16), and among Blacks (HR: 1.21; 95% CI: 1.00–1.47), but not non-Blacks
(HR: 1.03; 95% CI: 0.92–1.15); with CVD mortality among women (HR: 1.32; 95% CI: 1.06–1.66), but
not among men (HR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.64–1.20), Blacks (HR: 1.07; 95% CI: 0.74–1.55), nor non-Blacks
(HR: 1.10; 95% CI: 0.89–1.36). The combined intake of red and processed meat was associated with a
higher risk of all-cause mortality among all subgroups and CVD mortality among women and Blacks
(Figure 1). Complete results from subgroup analyses are available as online supplemental materials

comparing the 90th percentiles (sex- and race-specific values) of unprocessed red and processed meats 
intakes and both combined with zero-intake (90th vs. 0) were adjusted for age; sex (not in sex 
subgroup analysis); race (not in race subgroup analysis); marital status; education level; multivitamin 
use; smoking; alcohol use; exercise; sleeping hours; body mass index (BMI); diabetes mellitus; 
hypertension; hypercholesterolemia; aspirin use; the use of blood pressure medications for at least 2 
years in the last 5 years; the use of statin for at least 2 years in the last 5 years; menopausal status in 
women and hormone replacement therapy (HRT) among postmenopausal women; dietary energy; 
and dietary variables including cruciferous vegetables, fruits, whole grain, legumes, nuts and seeds, 
total dairy, eggs, fish, and unprocessed poultry. 
We also evaluated the linear relationships of these exposures with all-cause, CVD, and cancer 
mortality using 4-knot restricted cubic splines (Supplementary Figure S1). Unprocessed red meat 
intake and combined intake of red and processed meat appeared to have more clearly linear 
relationships with mortality outcomes as compared to processed meat intake. 
To explore the effects of residual confounding by smoking, we conducted separate analyses 
among participants who had never smoked (Supplementary Table S5). We report results for the 90th 
percentiles versus zero-intake: Unprocessed red meat intake was associated with all-cause mortality

intakes and both combined with zero-intake (90th vs. 0) were adjusted for age; sex (not in sex subgroup
analysis); race (not in race subgroup analysis); marital status; education level; multivitamin use;
smoking; alcohol use; exercise; sleeping hours; body mass index (BMI); diabetes mellitus; hypertension;
hypercholesterolemia; aspirin use; the use of blood pressure medications for at least 2 years in the
last 5 years; the use of statin for at least 2 years in the last 5 years; menopausal status in women and
hormone replacement therapy (HRT) among postmenopausal women; dietary energy; and dietary
variables including cruciferous vegetables, fruits, whole grain, legumes, nuts and seeds, total dairy,
eggs, fish, and unprocessed poultry.

1 Data are given as hazard ratio (95% confidence interval). 2 Values based on energy-adjusted variables. 3 Quartiles are based on percentiles of the energy-adjusted g/day intake of
total cohort. Median quartiles (g/day) are as follows, for unprocessed red meat, Q1 = 4, Q2 = 9.1, Q3 = 15.6, Q4 = 41.7; for processed meat, Q1 = 0.7, Q2 = 1.4, Q3 = 3.3, Q4 = 9.4; and
for combined intake of red and processed meats, Q1 = 1.4, Q2 = 7.3, Q3 = 15.4, Q4 = 42.8. Model 1 adjusted for age (attained age as time variable), sex (male and female), race (Black
and non-Black), and total energy intake (continuous). Model 2 adjusted for age (attained age as time variable), sex (male and female), race (Black and non-Black), total energy intake
(continuous), marital status (married/common-law and single/widowed/divorced/separated), educational level (up to high school graduate, trade school/some college/associate degree,
bachelor degree, and graduate degree), multivitamin use (current use), smoking status (current smoker, quit <1 year, quit 1–4 years, quit 5–9 years, quit 10–19 years, quit 20–29 years, quit
≥30 years, and never smoked), alcohol use (none, rarely, monthly, weekly, and daily), exercise (none, ≤20 min/week, 21–60 min/week, 61–150 min/week, and ≥151 min/week), sleep
(≤4 h/night, 5–8 h/night, and ≥9 h/night), body mass index (<18.5, 18.5–24.9, 25.0–29.9, and ≥30.0), aspirin use (yes/no: used weekly for at least two years in the last five years), having
ever been diagnosed with or received treatment in the last 12 months for diabetes (yes/no), having been diagnosed in the last 5 years with or received treatment in the last 12 months for
hypertension or hypercholesterolemia (yes/no), the use of statin for at least 2 years in the last 5 years, the use of blood pressure medications for at least 2 years in the last 5 years (yes/no),
and dietary variables (each variable has 5 levels in g/day) as follows. Cruciferous vegetables (Quintiles: <9.6, 9.6–16.7, >16.7–26.1, >26.1–45.2, >45.2), fruits (Quintiles: <130, 130–224.4,
>224.4–322, >322–464.2, >464.2), whole grain (Quintiles: <65, 65–109.9, >109.9–170.3, >170.3–252.2, >252.2), legumes (Quintiles: <17, 17–29.7, >29.7–45.9, >45.9–77.1, >77.1), nuts and
seeds (Quintiles: <6.4, 6.4–12.8, >12.8–21.6, >21.6–35.1, >35.1), total dairy (0 intake, quartiles of intake: >0–36, >36–108.1, >108.1–240.9, >240.9), eggs (0 intake, quartiles of intake: >0–3.6,
>3.6–7.3, >7.3–20.1, >20.1); and in women, the model also adjusted for menopausal status (premenopausal, postmenopausal), and hormone therapy (in postmenopausal women) (not
taking hormone therapy, taking hormone therapy). Model 3: In addition to covariates in model 2, also adjusted for other meat variables such as fish (0 intake, quartiles of intake: >0–7,
>7–12.6, >12.6–21.4, >21.4), and unprocessed poultry (0 intake, quartiles of intake: >0–4.8, >4.8–10.4, >10.4–32.5, >32.5). Also, for model 3 in unprocessed red meat, processed meat was
adjusted for (0 intake and quartiles of intake) and vice versa. 4 Models in these analyses are correspondents to models 1, 2, and 3, except energy-adjusted log-transformed continuous
dietary variables were used instead of five-level adjustment (90th percentile for unprocessed red meat: 46.5 g/day; for processed meat: 11 g/day; and for combined intake of red and
processed meats: 49.1 g/day). 5 Also adjusted for previous screening for colon, prostate, or breast cancers during the last four years. 6 Model 3 here did not adjust for either unprocessed
red meat or processed meat, but rather both were combined and used as one exposure variable.

We also evaluated the linear relationships of these exposures with all-cause, CVD, and cancer
mortality using 4-knot restricted cubic splines (Supplementary Figure S1). Unprocessed red meat intake
and combined intake of red and processed meat appeared to have more clearly linear relationships
with mortality outcomes as compared to processed meat intake.
To explore the effects of residual confounding by smoking, we conducted separate analyses
among participants who had never smoked (Supplementary Table S5). We report results for the 90th
percentiles versus zero-intake: Unprocessed red meat intake was associated with all-cause mortality
(HR: 1.16; 95% CI: 1.02–1.31) and CVD mortality (HR: 1.26; 95% CI: 1.02–1.56). Processed meat intake
was associated with all-cause mortality (HR: 1.13; 95% CI: 1.00–1.26), but not with CVD mortality
(HR: 1.15; 95% CI: 0.94–1.41). Combined intake of red and processed meat was associated with higher
risk of all-cause ((HR: 1.22; 95% CI: 1.08–1.37) and CVD (HR: 1.34; 95% CI: 1.08–1.65) mortality among
never smokers.
We calculated population attributable risk, in which we compared the 90th percentile of the
combined intake of red and processed meat (~49 g/day) with zero-intake. If the relationships were
causal, approximately 6.3% and 9% of total and CVD deaths, respectively, could have been prevented
if those in the 90th percentile of combined intake of red and processed meat had abstained.
4. Discussion
In the Adventist Health Study-2 (AHS-2), we found relatively low levels of consumption
of red and processed meat to be positively associated with all-cause and CVD mortality in
multivariable-adjusted models, compared to zero-intake. The associations appeared to be linear
(i.e., exhibiting a dose–response relationship) and of moderate strength. Stronger associations—though
less precise—were observed when the exposures were calibrated suggesting that measurement error
biased the uncalibrated results towards the null.
Other studies from the U.S. and Europe have found positive associations between red or processed
meat consumption and all-cause and CVD mortality [7–9,26–28]. In the U.S., three large cohort
studies—the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (HPFS), the Nurses’ Health Study (NHS), and the
American Association of Retired Persons (NIH-AARP) study—found associations of red and processed
meat intake with all-cause, CVD, and cancer mortality among both men and women [7,8,26]. The
relative risks of all-cause and CVD mortality in these studies ranged from 14 to 50% for red meat,
and from 9 to 72% for processed meat. From the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and
Nutrition (EPIC) study, Rohrmann et al. found a 14% higher risk of all-cause mortality associated with
red meat intake, and found 44% and 72% higher risks of all-cause and CVD mortality, respectively,
associated with processed meat [9]. Furthermore, Bellavia et al., in Sweden, found higher risks of
all-cause and CVD mortality by 21% and 29%, respectively, associated with red meat consumption [27].
Recently, processed meat was associated with 21% and 26% higher (relative) risks of overall and
CVD mortality, respectively, in The Netherlands Cohort Study [28]. These findings appear to be
compatible with ours, though they examine higher intake ranges. Meta-analyses have also found
positive associations of red and/or processed meat with all-cause and/or CVD mortality [29–31].
In contrast, studies in Asia have generally not found associations between red meat intake and
mortality [32] (except for Takata et al., who found a 18% higher risk of all-cause mortality among
men) [33].
Regarding cancer mortality, the three cohorts in the US have found significant associations, in
contrast to our null findings. This could be due to insufficient dietary adjustments in those studies
(we adjusted for multiple dietary variables including dairy, whole grains and legumes, which they have
been associated with reduced risk of some cancers) [34–36]; low and infrequent meat consumption in
our cohort (particularly processed meat that has been linked to cancer risk, especially in populations
with higher intakes) [37–39]; or the relative power limitations of our sample from this low cancer
incidence population [40]. Lack of association for cancer mortality does not necessarily indicate
no relationship to cancer incidence; for example, vegetarian dietary patterns (which are low in red
 Nutrients 2019, 11, 622
9 of 13
and processed meat) were not at lower risk of cancer mortality compared with nonvegetarians [41],
although they have been linked to lower overall cancer incidence in this cohort [42].
Previously in AHS–2, Orlich et al. found that vegetarians had a 12% reduced risk of all-cause
mortality as compared to nonvegetarians [41]; this could be due to lower intake of animal foods or
higher intake of plant foods among vegetarians. In our analyses, we were able to control for foods
commonly consumed by vegetarians such as legumes, whole grains, and nuts and seeds [10], yet we
found that highest intakes of red and processed meat were associated with an 18–51% higher risk of
all-cause mortality as compared to zero-intake participants. Such findings suggest a possible effect of
red and processed meat in increasing mortality after controlling for plant foods.
Some possible causal mechanisms have been proposed for the link between red and processed
meat consumption and mortality. Red meat is rich in saturated fatty acids, which have been associated
with dyslipidemia, particularly elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) [43]. High LDL levels are
associated with a higher risk of atherosclerosis [44] and acute myocardial infarction [45]. Furthermore,
red meat intake has been associated with increased levels of inflammatory and oxidative stress markers
such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) that have been associated
with cardiovascular diseases [46]. Heme iron in red and processed red meats has been associated
with higher risk of type 2 diabetes [5] and cardiovascular diseases [47,48] including myocardial
infarction [49] and coronary heart disease [50]. Also, red meat is rich in L-carnitine, and recent research
found that L-carnitine metabolism by intestinal microbiota elevates the level of a metabolite known as
trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) [51], which was linked with a higher risk of cardiovascular diseases,
particularly atherosclerosis [51,52]. Additionally, large amounts of sodium are used in some meat
processing [53]; high intakes of sodium are associated with elevated blood pressure, a major risk factor
for CVD [54–56].
This study fills an important gap in the literature, in that we were able to evaluate the association
of red and processed meat at low consumption levels compared to zero-intake subjects, whereas
other studies have only compared risk at higher intake levels. For example, the 90th percentile of
unprocessed red meat intake in our population was 46.5 g/day, which is approximately equivalent
to a half serving per day—meat serving size ranges from 3 to 4 ounces (85–113 g)—in the FFQ of
AHS-2. However, in HPFS and NHS, men who consumed 1.46 serving/day were compared with those
who consumed 0.17 serving/day, and women who consumed 1.64 serving/day were compared with
those who consumed 0.37 serving/day [7]. In NIH-AARP, the highest intakes ranged from 65.9 to
68.1 g/1000 kcal and were compared with approximately 9 g/1000 kcal as a reference group [8]. These
ranges of intakes are considerably higher than those in our population. No other studies compare
low-to-moderate intake with zero-intake. Another strength of this study is the use of regression
calibration to minimize the effects of dietary measurement error. Although regression calibration
was only used for the exposures of interest, and not for other dietary covariates, it provided less
biased association estimates—though also less precise—compared to the uncalibrated results. Another
strength is the relatively low prevalence of smoking and alcohol use, reducing the potential residual
confounding. To further minimize the effect of confounding by smoking, we separately explored the
associations among never-smoked participants, and these findings were consistent with those from the
main analyses. Finally, we included detailed adjustments for multiple confounders including lifestyle
factors and food groups to minimize the effect of confounding. Intakes of red and processed meat
have been associated with several unfavorable lifestyle and dietary confounders including obesity,
smoking, physical inactivity, and low intakes of fruits and vegetable [57]. Besides adjusting for these
factors, we additionally adjusted for multiple dietary factors such as dairy, legumes, whole grains, and
nuts and seeds.
An inherent limitation in this type of study is measurement error in dietary assessment.
In particular, processed meat measurement by FFQ showed low validity compared to multiple

processed meat; infrequently consumed foods may be missed by dietary recalls. However, validity

for unprocessed red meat was relatively high. Another limitation is the single dietary assessment,
whereas dietary habits may have changed. However, a majority of subjects in the AHS-2, especially
middle-aged and elderly, tend to have fairly stable dietary intakes over time [58].
Finally, the
possibility of unmeasured or residual confounding remains, despite our efforts to adjust for multiple
potential confounders.
5. Conclusions
In conclusion, we found higher all-cause and CVD mortality to be associated with relatively low
intake of red and processed meat (and of unprocessed red meat in particular), compared to zero intake.
While caution is appropriate in inferring causation from observational data, these results suggest
possible adverse effects of red and processed meat, even with low to moderate levels of intake.
