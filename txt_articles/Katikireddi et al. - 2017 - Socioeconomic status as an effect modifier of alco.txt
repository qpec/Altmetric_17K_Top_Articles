Socioeconomic status as an effect modifier of alcohol 
consumption and harm: analysis of linked cohort data
Srinivasa Vittal Katikireddi, Elise Whitley, Jim Lewsey, Linsay Gray, Alastair H Leyland
Summary
Background Alcohol-related mortality and morbidity are high in socioeconomically disadvantaged populations 
compared with individuals from advantaged areas. It is unclear if this increased harm reflects differences in alcohol 
consumption between these socioeconomic groups, reverse causation (ie, downward social selection for high-risk 
drinkers), or a greater risk of harm in individuals of low socioeconomic status compared with those of higher status 
after similar consumption. We aimed to investigate whether the harmful effects of alcohol differ by socioeconomic 
status, accounting for alcohol consumption and other health-related factors.
Methods The Scottish Health Surveys are record-linked cross-sectional surveys representative of the adult population 
of Scotland. We obtained baseline demographics and data for alcohol consumption (units per week and binge 
drinking) from Scottish Health Surveys done in 1995, 1998, 2003, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012. We matched these 
data to records for deaths, admissions, and prescriptions. The primary outcome was alcohol-attributable admission or 
death. The relation between alcohol-attributable harm and socioeconomic status was investigated for four measures 
(education level, social class, household income, and area-based deprivation) using Cox proportional hazards models. 
The potential for alcohol consumption and other risk factors (including smoking and body-mass index [BMI]) 
mediating social patterning was explored in separate regression models. Reverse causation was tested by comparing 
change in area deprivation over time.
Findings 50 236 participants (21 777 men and 28 459 women) were included in the analytical sample, with 
429 986 person-years of follow-up. Low socioeconomic status was associated consistently with strikingly raised 
alcohol-attributable harms, including after adjustment for weekly consumption, binge drinking, BMI, and smoking. 
Evidence was noted of effect modification; for example, relative to light drinkers living in advantaged areas, the risk of 
alcohol-attributable admission or death for excessive drinkers was increased (hazard ratio 6·12, 95% CI 4·45–8·41 in 
advantaged areas; and 10·22, 7·73–13·53 in deprived areas). We found little support for reverse causation.
Interpretation Disadvantaged social groups have greater alcohol-attributable harms compared with individuals from 
advantaged areas for given levels of alcohol consumption, even after accounting for different drinking patterns, 
obesity, and smoking status at the individual level.

Introduction
Alcohol consumption accounts for a growing burden of 
death and disability worldwide.1 Both alcohol-related 
deaths (for which alcohol is a contributory cause) and 
alcohol-attributable deaths (for which alcohol is solely the 
cause) occur more commonly among disadvantaged 
socio 
economic groups compared with populations from 
advantaged areas, thereby contributing to health 
inequalities.2–4 However, the mechanisms through which 
alcohol consumption leads to health inequalities are 
poorly understood.5 Although alcohol-attributable harms 
are recorded more frequently in disadvantaged socio-
economic groups, gradients in consumption are small or 
even absent internationally—a finding usually referred to 
as the alcohol harm paradox.6 This situation is the case 
within Scotland too, where alcohol-related admissions are 
more than seven times more frequent among people 
living in the most deprived areas compared with those 
living in the least disadvantaged areas.7 However, few 
consumption differences have been noted in population-
representative survey data.8
Several potential explanations exist for the apparent 
discrepancy between levels of alcohol consumption and 
rates of alcohol-attributable harms recorded across 
social groups.5 First, methodological differences in how 
consumption and harms are calculated could be 
important. Second, differences in the patterns of alcohol 
consumption—eg, augmented binge drinking—or 
other known risk factors, including body-mass index 
(BMI), could be relevant. Third, there is potential for 
reverse causation, with alcohol consumption resulting 
in adverse socioeconomic circumstances—ie, downward 
social selection. Finally, it is possible that the relation 
between alcohol consumption and subsequent harms 
could differ between social groups at the individual 
level.

Developing the most effective health policy to narrow 
inequalities requires an understanding of the alcohol 
harm paradox. We aimed to assess whether the harmful 
effects of alcohol consumption differ by socioeconomic 
status and, if so, the extent to which differences are 
accounted for by differences in drinking patterns, 
smoking, and BMI at the individual level.
Methods
Data sources
The Scottish Health Surveys are repeated, record-linked, 
cross-sectional surveys, intended to be representative of 
the community-dwelling adult population of Scotland.9 
Trained interviewers survey adults face to face to obtain 
demographics and lifestyle factors, and they measure 
height and weight. For our study, we used baseline data 
from surveys done in 1995, 1998, 2003, 2008, 2009, 2010, 
2011, and 2012. During the survey, participants were 
asked to give informed consent for their data to be linked 
confidentially to administrative health records, and for 
data sharing, with at least 85% of participants consenting 
every year.10
Procedures
We used probabilistic linkage to link Scottish Health 
Survey data to NHS Scotland’s Community Health Index, 
a unique identifier available for more than 99% of the 
adult population. We then used the identifier for 
deterministic linkage to mortality, general inpatient and 
psychiatry hospital discharge records (respectively, the 
Scottish Morbidity Records 01 and 04),9 and community 
prescriptions. Validated hospital discharge data were 
available from 1981 onwards, whereas community 
prescriptions data were available from 2008. Prescription 
data for participants who had a prescription filled 
by a community pharmacist in Scotland also provided 
follow-up measures of area-based deprivation.
We pooled data for the eight cohorts formed through 
record linkage, with time at risk starting from the 
approximate date (month and year) of participation. 
We excluded participants who had been admitted because 
of an alcohol-attributable condition before survey baseline 
measures; for analyses that included binge drinking (for 
which data were available from 1998 onwards), we 
excluded the 1995 survey data. Moreover, we excluded 
participants who had ever been admitted for a drug-related 
reason or had received a prescription for a medication 
related to drug dependence—ie, naltrexone, methadone, 
buprenorphine, and lofexidine. The appendix (p 1) 
provides details of participants who were excluded. 
Sensitivity analyses with these participants included did 
not materially change the findings (data not shown).
Detailed questions about alcohol consumption have 
been asked consistently across all survey waves 
(except for binge drinking, which was not included in the 
1995 survey) and have been described previously.11 We used 
two key measures of alcohol consumption: number of 
units consumed in the previous week (with a unit defined 
as 8 g of pure alcohol); and binge drinking. We classified 
weekly alcohol consumption into five groups: never 
drinker or ex-drinker; light drinker (1–10 units for men, 
1–7 units for women); moderate drinker (11–20 units for 
men, 8–13 units for women); heavy drinker (21–50 units 
for men, 14–35 units for women); and excessive drinker 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We initially searched MEDLINE and Embase in March, 2013, using 
keywords including “alcohol”, “socioeconomic status”, 
“socioeconomic position”, “deprivation”, and “inequalities”. 
Previous studies suggested a potential increased risk of harm for 
similar alcohol consumption levels among socioeconomically 
disadvantaged populations, but whether this hypothesis is correct 
remains unclear. A systematic review published in 2015 on the 
relation between socioeconomic status, alcohol consumption, and 
alcohol-attributable harms concluded that studies investigating 
the interaction between alcohol-attributable disease, 
socioeconomic status, and alcohol use are scarce.
Added value of this study
To the best of our knowledge, our study is the largest to date 
investigating whether socioeconomic status effect modifies the 
relation between alcohol consumption and harm, and is the 
only one to investigate a range of potential alternative 
explanations, including reverse causation. Using high-quality 
survey data linked to admissions, mortality, and community 
prescriptions, we eliminated several important biases as 
potential explanations for the higher burden of 
alcohol-attributable harms in more socioeconomically 
disadvantaged populations. Alcohol consumption and binge 
drinking did not differ substantially with socioeconomic status. 
Despite this finding, the risk of harm was increased strikingly 
among socioeconomically disadvantaged populations. 
Implications of all the available evidence
Alcohol-attributable harms are a major contributor to health 
inequalities. The body of available evidence indicates that this 
differential burden does not arise simply as a result of higher 
risk consumption among socioeconomically disadvantaged 
groups. Efforts to target alcohol consumption by 
socioeconomic status are unlikely to be successful in reducing 
health inequalities, unless drinking cultures in the most 
disadvantaged populations differ systematically from societal 
norms. Interventions seeking to reduce consumption across the 
whole population are more likely to result in greater reductions 
in absolute health inequalities than previously thought. Further 
research is needed to investigate the reasons for the noted 
effect modification.

(≥51 units for men, ≥36 units for women). We defined 
binge drinking on the basis of exceeding the UK 
Government’s recommen 
dations (during the period of 
data collection) for consumption on 1 day—ie, 6 units for 
women and 8 units for men.12
We investigated multiple dimensions of socioeconomic 
status, reflecting different stages of the life course 
and including individual, household, and area-level 
indicators. 
We 
categorised 
highest 
educational 
qualifications into six groups on the basis of the 
International Standard Classification of Education 
(ISCED):13 degree or above (ISCED levels 6–8); higher 
national certificate (HNC) or higher national diploma 
(HND; ISCED level 5); Scottish higher grade or equiv 
a-
lent (ISCED level 4); Scottish standard grade or equivalent 
(ISCED level 3); other school (ISCED levels 1 or 2); 
none (ISCED level 0). We categorised social class into 
six groups on the basis of the Registrar General’s 
classification:14 I (professional); II (intermediate); IIINM 
(skilled non-manual); IIIM (skilled manual); IV (partly 
skilled); and V (unskilled). We grouped equivalised 
household income into quintiles accounting for 
differences in household composition (on a scale of 1–5, 
with 5 the highest and 1 the lowest). The Scottish Index 
of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD) is an area-based measure 
of deprivation that ranks small geographical areas (with 
a median population of 750 people) on the basis of 
multiple facets of deprivation identified in administrative 
data.15 SIMD quintiles, therefore, provided an area-based 
categorical measure of deprivation allowing investigation 
of social mobility over time (on a scale of 1–5, with 5 the 
least deprived and 1 the most deprived).
To investigate effect modification, we collapsed each of 
the socioeconomic status variables into dichotomous 
high and low categories, so that roughly equal numbers 
of events occurred within each group. We split highest 
educational qualification into none, other school, 
and Scottish standard grade (low) versus Scottish higher 
grade, HNC, HND, and degree or above (high). 
We dichotomised area-based deprivation into the most 
deprived two quintiles (1 and 2; low) versus the 
least deprived three quintiles (3–5; high). We categorised 
social class as manual (IIIM, IV, and V; low) versus 
non-manual (I, II, and IIINM; high) occupations. Finally, 
we split income into the lowest two quintiles (1 and 2; 
low) versus the highest three quintiles (3–5; high).
We defined all covariates on the basis of a preplanned 
analysis protocol and chose them to minimise potential 
confounding on the basis of previous knowledge. 
We included age and sex in all statistical models. 
Further 
covariates 
included 
BMI 
(derived 
from 
interviewer-measured 
weight 
and 
height) 
and 
self-reported smoking status, which we categorised into 
five 
groups: 
never 
smoker, 
ex-smoker, 
current 
light smoker (fewer than ten cigarettes per day), current 
moderate smoker (ten to 19 cigarettes per day), and 
current heavy smoker (20 or more cigarettes per day).
We also assessed the potential for reverse causation—
ie, downward social selection occurring as a result of 
high-risk alcohol consumption. We compared baseline 
area-based deprivation as assessed in the Scottish Health 
Surveys (measured in quintiles) with that ascertained 
during follow-up (identified by flagging the last available 
deprivation quintile from postcode in prescriptions, 
admissions, and mortality data).
Outcomes
The primary outcome was either alcohol-attributable 
admission or alcohol-attributable death, which we 
defined on the basis of standardised International 
Classification of Diseases ninth revision (ICD-9) and 
tenth revision (ICD-10) diagnostic codes,16,17 with the list 
of conditions in the appendix (p 2). To limit disclosure 
risk, we used approximate dates (month and year). 
Mortality and hospital discharge data in Scotland have 
been shown previously to be more than 99% complete 
and have more than 90% accuracy.18,19
The secondary outcome was any of alcohol-attributable 
death, alcohol-attributable admission, or prescription for 
a medication deemed to be related to alcohol dependence 
(namely, acamprosate, disulfiram, and chlordiazepoxide). 
We did sensitivity analyses to allow for the addition of 
diazepam and thiamine as alcohol-related medications.
Statistical analysis
For the primary analysis, we used Cox proportional 
hazards models to investigate associations between 
exposures of interest and the first episode of an alcohol-
attributable 
outcome. 
The 
proportional 
hazards 
assumption was met. In view of the potential non-
linearity in associations between alcohol consumption 
and harms, we fitted a fractional polynomial function for 
alcohol consumption to allow for the best functional 
form to be determined.20 Our initial model for the 
association between an alcohol-attributable event and 
each of the socioeconomic status variables included age 
(as a fractional polynomial function), sex, and survey 
wave. We then included in nested models the following 
covariates, incrementally: alcohol consumption; binge 
drinking; smoking status; and BMI (modelled as a 
fractional polynomial). We calculated p values with the 
Wald test based on combined hazard ratio (HR) and SE 
estimates obtained by application of Rubin’s rules for 
combining multiply imputed data. We next assessed the 
potential for associations between consumption and 
harms to differ by socioeconomic status; we categorised 
the sample on the basis of both alcohol consumption and 
socioeconomic status. The reference group for this 
analysis 
was 
light 
alcohol 
consumption 
among 
individuals with high socioeconomic status, and we 
compared relative risks against this reference group. We 
presented graphically the probability of having alcohol-
attributable harm for a given alcohol consumption, 
stratified by socioeconomic status. There was no strong

evidence of any statistical interactions with sex and age 
and we, therefore, present results for all sex and age-
groups combined.
Because community prescriptions data were unavailable 
before 2008, it was not possible to model the secondary 
outcome using survival analysis. Therefore, we treated 
the secondary outcome as a binary variable, classifying 
participants into those who had or did not have the 
outcome during the period of follow-up, and modelled it 
using logistic regression. This approach assumed no 
differential receipt of alcohol-related prescriptions before 
2008 and is, therefore, likely to underestimate inequalities. 
We did sensitivity analyses of logistic regression models 
in the same manner as for the primary outcome.
We investigated the potential for downward social 
selection as a result of alcohol consumption through 
cross-tabulation of SIMD quintiles over time, stratified 
by baseline weekly alcohol consumption and binge 
drinking. We then used linear regression models 
(adjusting for age, sex, and survey wave) to test explicitly 
the association between high-risk alcohol consumption 
and social mobility. Because SIMD information at 
follow-up was only available for a subsample of all 
participants (72% of the main sample analysed), we did a 
robustness check of the primary analysis using these 
data to ensure that differences did not arise as a result of 
selection bias in the analytical sample. Similarly, we 
restricted our analysis of social selection to participants 
from 2008 onwards and excluding ascertainment of 
deprivation from deaths in robustness analyses.
All variables analysed were more than 88% complete 
(appendix p 3). However, to minimise the potential for 
bias arising from missing data, we fitted all statistical 
models to data with ten rounds of multiple imputation, 
using chained equations,21 with all terms (including 
interactions) contained within the imputation model. 
We did all analyses in Stata version 13.2.

Results
50 236 participants (21 777 men and 28 459 women) were 
included in the analytical sample (table 1). Considerable 
variation in drinking behaviours was noted by sex, with 
men tending to pursue high-risk drinking patterns 
(4236 [19%] men and 3206 [11%] women reported binge 
drinking in the previous week). Women were more likely 
to be never smokers and ex-smokers and to have a 
slightly lower BMI, compared with men. During 
follow-up of 429 986 person-years, 1022 people achieved 
the primary outcome—ie, alcohol-attributable death or 
admission (appendix p 4)—with more men than women 
affected. Using the broader secondary outcome of 
alcohol-attributable death, admission, or receipt of a 
prescription related to alcohol dependence, this number 
increased to 1398 affected individuals (table 1). The 
appendix (pp 5–8) summarises alcohol consumption 
according to the four different measures of socioeconomic 
status, illustrating relatively comparable consumption 
across socioeconomic groups in cross-sectional data.
In unadjusted analyses, and after adjustment for age, 
sex, and survey wave, alcohol-attributable events occurred

more frequently among socially disadvantaged groups, 
according to all four socioeconomic status measures 
(table 2). Associations recorded were large, with more 
than three-fold higher rates of alcohol-attributable harms 
among the most disadvantaged populations compared 
with the most advantaged, according to all four socio-
economic status measures. Adjustment for alcohol 
consumption and binge drinking had little effect on the 
magnitude of the associations seen. Further adjustment 
for BMI and smoking status attenuated associations only 
slightly, suggesting that the social patterning of alcohol-
attributable harms might not be accounted for by 
differences in these other risk factors. For example, the 
HR for participants with no qualifications compared with 
people educated to degree level was 3·76 (95% CI 
2·96–4·77) when adjusting for age, sex and survey wave; 
additional adjustment for weekly alcohol consumption 
and binge drinking left the risk relatively unchanged 
(3·44, 2·61–4·52), whereas further adjustment for 
smoking and BMI attenuated the HR to 2·50 (1·88–3·31). 
Analysis of the secondary outcome, which uses a broader 
definition of alcohol-attributable harm and includes 
prescription for a medication related to alcohol 
dependence, yielded similar results (appendix pp 9–12).
Effect modification was noted for all four socioeconomic 
status measures on alcohol consumption for alcohol-
attributable harms (table 3, figure 1). For example, 
compared with light drinkers living in areas of low 
deprivation, the HR for excessive drinkers in similar 
areas was 6·12 (95% CI 4·45–8·41) but rose to 10·22 
(7·73–13·53) for excessive drinkers living in deprived 
areas. To ease interpretation, figure 2 presents equivalent 
results from the logistic regression analyses graphically. 
Lower socioeconomic groups had a greater absolute 
risk of harm for any given level of consumption 
but additionally, increased consumption is generally 
associated with disproportionately increased risk of 
alcohol-attributable harm among those of lower

socioeconomic status. This relation was recorded across 
all four measures, but was least evident when assessed 
by social class. For completeness, we checked for and did 
not find effect modification on a multiplicative scale 
(appendix pp 13, 14).
To investigate the extent to which social selection might 
contribute to the social patterning of alcohol-attributable 
harms, SIMD quintile membership was compared 
between survey year and latest follow-up with reference to 
alcohol consumption reported in the survey. Most parti-
cipants did not change deprivation category but the most 
movement was noted among participants consuming the 
greatest volume of alcohol (table 4) and who engaged in 
binge drinking (appendix pp 15–20), although this change 
included both upward and downwards mobility. When 
examined in regression analyses, higher baseline alcohol 
consumption and binge drinking were both associated 
with only very slight upward social mobility.
Robustness analyses for the secondary outcome 
(appendix pp 13, 14), complete cases (appendix pp 15–20), 
restricting the analysis to the 72% subsample with 
longitudinal deprivation data (appendix pp 21, 22), and 
alternative approaches to investigating social selection 
(appendix pp 23–29) all yielded similar findings to the 
main results.
Discussion
Our findings show that alcohol-attributable harms are far 
higher in disadvantaged social groups, even when 
accounting for differences in consumption and binge 
drinking and irrespective of which measure of 
socioeconomic status is used. These inequalities are not 
accounted for by differences in smoking or BMI. 
Increased alcohol consumption is associated with harm 
in all socioeconomic groups, but disproportionately so 
for individuals with low socioeconomic status. There is 
little evidence for reverse causation—that is, high-risk 
consumption leading to social disadvantage is not the 
explanation for these findings.
Our study has several strengths. By contrast with most 
previous studies, we used data linkage to ensure that 
differences in the sampling frames for people reporting 
consumption and those experiencing harm did not result 
in selection bias and we overcame the possible ecological 
fallacy by using individual-level data. Availability of high-
quality administrative data allowed us to exclude 
participants who had previously had alcohol-attributable 
harms, thereby minimising potential reverse causation. 
Furthermore, we investigated the issue of reverse 
causation directly. We studied several dimensions of 
socioeconomic status and reported remarkably consistent 
results across measures. The robustness of our findings 
was assessed using several prespecified outcomes.
Some limitations of our study should be noted. First, 
although the Scottish Health Surveys are intended to be 
representative of the general population, they system 
at-
ically under-represent some groups at higher risk of 
harm,10,22 and a small proportion of the cohort were 
excluded because of non-consent for linkage. Therefore, 
our study might not allow inferences to be made about 
the most severely disadvantaged populations, such as 
homeless people. Second, our study relies on self-
reported alcohol consumption. Theoretically, systematic 
reporting differences between social groups could result 
in bias, although our use of several measures of 
socioeconomic status reduces the likelihood of this bias. 
Furthermore, existing research suggests that differential 
reporting between sociodemographic groups does not 
seem to be an important source of bias.23 Third, we have 
only been able to investigate the effect of total weekly 
alcohol consumption and binge drinking and not more 
detailed patterns of alcohol consumption and different 
types of drink. Similarly, our consumption measures 
were taken at one timepoint, rather than capturing 
information on lifetime drinking. The finding of greater

alcohol-attributable harms among very light drinkers 
with a low socioeconomic status could reflect previous 
consumption patterns. This possibility could be the case 
among the combined category of never drinkers and 
ex-drinkers (who were pooled for statistical power), 
because ex-drinkers include people who stop consuming 
alcohol because of the development of health conditions 
or previous dependence. The consistency in findings 
across 
socioeconomic 
measures—which 
reflect 
different points in the life course and the magnitude of 
social patterning of harms that persisted after 
adjustment—make these factors less likely to account 
for our overall findings. However, if high-risk drinkers 
with low socioeconomic status are less likely to modify 
their drinking than are people with high socioeconomic 
status after the survey, this could also result in 
unaccounted 
time-varying 
confounding. 
Fourth, 
systematic differences in ascertainment of outcomes 
could be possible if some socioeconomic groups were 
less likely to be identified through administrative 
records. This risk is minimised by the very low 
prevalence of private health care provision in Scotland 
and the high ascertainment of outcomes possible 
through linkage to the Community Health Index, which 
allows for emigration from Scotland to be identified.
In a previous meta-analysis of longitudinal research, 
an increased risk of alcohol-attributable harms was noted 
among more disadvantaged social groups.24 McDonald 
and colleagues25 previously studied the relation between 
alcohol consumption and alcohol-attributable harms, 
also using linked Scottish Health Survey data, and they 
noted higher harms with area-level deprivation. Similarly, 
Makela and colleagues2 reported greater harms in 
manual (compared with non-manual) workers using 
linked Finnish survey data. In a cross-sectional study in 
New Zealand,26 self-reported measures of alcohol-related 
harms did not differ between social groups once patterns 
of consumption were accounted for. Although the 
relation between socioeconomic status and alcohol-
attributable and alcohol-related harms is well established, 
there is little consensus about the mechanisms 
underpinning this relation. Evidence about whether 
high-risk alcohol consumption is more common among 
disadvantaged communities is mixed, with some studies 
describing greater levels of consumption among more 
socioeconomically advantaged individuals,27 but greater 
binge drinking,28 and more extreme drinking among 
those more disadvantaged.29 In keeping with our results, 
findings of a study in England showed evidence of the 
alcohol harm paradox, irrespective of which measure of 
socio 
economic status was used.30
Reducing social inequalities in health remains a 
priority. To date, much of the alcohol-orientated policy 
effort in many countries has been focused on reducing 
alcohol consumption among more disadvantaged social 
groups.31 Our study findings show that the risk of alcohol-
attributable harms among moderate alcohol consumers 
of low socioeconomic status is greater than for those who 
drink heavily but are socioeconomically advantaged. The 
lived experiences of poverty shape the emergence of 
health outcomes, not only through health-related 
behaviours but also as a result of poor material circum-
stances and psychosocial stresses.32 Poverty might, 
therefore, reduce resilience to disease, predisposing 
drinkers of low socioeconomic status to greater health 
harms despite exposure to similar levels of risk factors as 
drinkers of high socioeconomic status.
Our findings highlight the need for policy to prioritise 
the tackling of inequalities in alcohol-attributable harms. 
Furthermore, reductions in overall levels of population 
consumption seem most likely to narrow health 
inequalities. Findings of modelling studies suggest that 
the introduction of price-based policy interventions, such 
as minimum unit pricing, will yield greatest benefits to 
disadvantaged groups.33 Such studies have typically 
assumed that similar consumption of alcohol results in 
comparable levels of harm among different social groups. 
Because similar alcohol consumption exerts greatest 
harm among more disadvantaged groups, the effect of 
population-based 
prevention 
efforts 
on 
health 
inequalities have the potential to be larger than previously 
anticipated. This outcome is especially relevant because 
of the planned implementation of minimum unit pricing 
in Scotland, which has been delayed substantially after 
legal challenges from the alcohol industry34,35—the

All models were adjusted for age, sex, study wave, smoking, body-mass index, and binge drinking in the past week. The lines represent the predicted probability of 
experiencing an alcohol-attributable event (estimated from logistic regression models) and the shading denotes the 95% CI.  (A) Deprivation was categorised 
according to the most deprived two quintiles vs the least deprived three quintiles. (B) Social class categorisation was based on manual vs non-manual occupations. 
(C) Education was categorised according to attainment of none, other school, or Scottish standard grade qualifications vs Scottish higher grade, higher national 
certificate, higher national diploma, or degree or above. (D) Household income was categorised by the lowest two quintiles vs highest three quintiles. Follow-up for 
household income measures was shorter because participants were not asked about this information in the first two study waves of data collection.

beneficial effects in terms of reduced health inequalities 
could be even greater than currently expected.
Further research to understand the mechanisms by 
which health inequalities arise is needed. In relation to 
alcohol-attributable harms, this effort requires investi-
gating relations between consumption patterns by social 
groups and specific diseases.36 In the future, more 
nuanced measures of alcohol consumption over time 
and biological measurements of liver function could 
address current weaknesses in the evidence base. 
Furthermore, investigating the contribution of detailed 
nutritional factors and physical activity might suggest 
other mechanisms amenable to modification. Our study 
has focused on a narrow definition of harm—quantifying 
the broader range of alcohol-related harms will reveal the 
true magnitude of the alcohol harm paradox. Findings of 
previous studies on other important modifiable risk 
factors—eg, 
smoking 
and 
obesity—have 
shown 
moderately increased harms arising from comparable 
doses among socially disadvantaged groups.37 Future 
studies are now needed to investigate further modifiable 
risk factors and better understand the comparative 
effectiveness of specific interventions, including health 
and social policies, to narrow inequalities.
