 Trends 
Advances in research and medical practices have made significant inroads towards the 
treatment of diseases at the single patient level. This paradigm, precision medicine, holds 
the promise of reducing adverse effects, improving preventative care, and reducing costs 
by tailoring individual treatment based on highly detailed diagnostics.   
 
Humans harbor trillions of microbes, termed the microbiome, which is now being 
appreciated as being a hugely substantial facet of health. Immune, metabolic, 
neurological, and other processes impact and are impacted by the microbiome. 
 
The microbiome not only is a significant factor in health, but it is one that can be both 
readily assayed through DNA sequencing and directly modified by various targeted 
interventions. Therefore, the currently genetic information dominated field of precision 
medicine would be greatly enhanced by the introduction of the microbiome.

Abstract 
12 
Understanding how individual people respond to medical therapy is a key facet of 
13 
improving the odd-ratio that interventions will have a positive impact. Reducing the non-
14 
responder rate for an intervention or reducing complications associated with a particular 
15 
treatment or surgery is the next stage of medical advance. The Precision Medicine 
16 
Initiative, launched in January 2015, set the stage for enhanced collaboration between 
17 
researchers and medical professionals to develop next-generation techniques to aid 
18 
patient treatment and recovery, and increased the opportunities for impactful preemptive 
19 
care. The microbiome plays a crucial role in health and disease, as it influences 
20 
endocrinology, physiology and even neurology, altering the outcome of many different 
21 
disease states, and it augments drug responses and tolerance. We review the implications

Introduction to Precision Medicine 
26 
The sequencing of the human genome [1] in 2001 fostered advances in both our 
27 
understanding of the genomic basis of disease and in the DNA sequencing technologies 
28 
required to bring the results of this understanding to patients. This is often referred to as 
29 
precision genomic medicine, which utilizes a patient’s individual genome to inform 
30 
treatment and care, based on known genomic markers for disease [2]. The broader, 
31 
inclusive field of precision medicine couples a person’s treatment with what is known 
32 
about their population, life style, and medical history, by matching clinical data and 
33 
genetic biomarkers. Since the genome is sometimes conceptualized as the core of human 
34 
individuality, at least in terms of disease, the broader field of precision medicine is often 
35 
conflated with genomic medicine. Precision medicine, however, includes aspects 
36 
downstream from the genome, including gene expression and protein expression as well 
37 
as metabolic markers. Nonetheless, genomic information is the most commonly used and 
38 
has had great successes [3]. Cancer treatment in particular has been revolutionized by 
39 
genomic medicine [4], which exemplifies that despite difficulties in implementing 
40 
precision medicine, it is a deeply important development. In particular, achieving the 
41 
goals of precision medicine, including diagnosing disease more accurately and reducing 
42 
the relative risk of treatments, side effects, and non-responses to medications, will 
43 
revolutionize both treatment courses — ideally at the single patient level [5] — and the 
44 
structuring of medical care and costs, moving towards cheaper, preventative focused 
45 
medicine. 
46 
 
47 
The Microbiome as a Precision Medicine Frontier 
48 
 4 
In this review we focus on a more recent but in many ways analogous development, that 
49 
of introducing the microbiome into precision medicine. The human microbiome is the 
50 
“the ecological community of commensal, symbiotic, and pathogenic microorganisms 
51 
that literally share our body space” [6]. These microorganisms, mainly bacteria, fungi, 
52 
archaea, and viruses in the gastrointestinal tract, are slightly more abundant than the 
53 
human cells in the body, leading some to classify them as an newly discovered organ [7]. 
54 
It is important to note however that the microbiome is compositionally and 
55 
spatiotemporally far more fluid and mutable than human cells and organs. Therefore, the 
56 
microbial “organ” may be better described as a “cloud” of genetic information accessory 
57 
to the stable human genome [8]. Certainly, the influences of the microbiome on our 
58 
physiology are significant and multitudinous, affecting immunology [9], neurology 
59 
[10,11], endocrinology [12], and, importantly for precision medicine, disease states and 
60 
clinical outcomes. Because microbiome science is a nascent but quickly developing field, 
61 
additional important functions of the microbiome are likely still to be discovered. These 
62 
discoveries are driven by similar sequencing technology as that which has enabled 
63 
personal genomics, and this technology is decreasing rapidly in price [13], so much so 
64 
that personal microbiome sequencing is already available to the consumer (e.g. American 
65 
Gut - americangut.org; uBiome - ubiome.com). Furthermore, the well-developed analysis 
66 
and statistical techniques of genomic medicine have commonalities with microbiome 
67 
analysis. Since microbiome states are highly individual even between co-raised identical 
68 
twins [14], but can be rapidly changed [15] (unlike genetics), there is a profound 
69 
opportunity for individualized treatments. However, the microbiome, like any ecosystem 
70 
is also profoundly complex, and so the goals of precision microbial medicine require 
71 
 5 
considerably more research before they are appropriately realized [16]. Nonetheless, the 
72 
microbiome, as we shall exemplify here, is primed and ready for precision medicine, and 
73 
therefore the clinical application of this new therapeutic area is on the immediate horizon. 
74 
Various complementary routes of assaying and modifying the microbiome have been 
75 
proposed and tentatively utilized towards this end; these will be laid out here in the 
76 
following text as well as diagrammatically (Figure 1). 
77 
 
78 
Review of Microbiome Analysis Techniques 
79 
How then could microbiome precision medicine be implemented? Currently two 
80 
complementary analyses, both beginning with the extraction of microbial genomic DNA, 
81 
are standard in the field: 16S rRNA sequencing and shotgun metagenomics. The 16S 
82 
rRNA gene has both highly conserved regions, allowing for the usage of extremely 
83 
bacterially nonspecific primers, and “hypervariable” regions, where base pair differences 
84 
can often provide species level identification [17]. Thus, 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing 
85 
provides a robust tool for identification as well as classification and even discovery of 
86 
bacteria [18]. A typical 16S rRNA study utilizes the differences in observed communities 
87 
of bacteria between differing samples to obtain statistically significant correlations 
88 
between bacterial composition and sample description, for example to identify 
89 
differences in the gut microbiomes of children born to obese mothers [19]. These studies 
90 
have led to key insights into the human microbiome. While historically the majority of 
91 
biomedical research on bacteria has focused on eliminating pathogens, many bacteria as 
92 
well as communities of bacteria are important in both health and disease [6]. Though 
93 
identifying causative bacteria in disease states will be an important facet of precision 
94 
 6 
medicine, understanding the overall ecology of the microbiome may be equally or even 
95 
more vital. 
96 
 
97 
Therefore, to go beyond bacterial identification and subsequent, limited patient 
98 
stratification, it will be essential to understand the functional potential of the microbiome. 
99 
Shotgun metagenomics enables the researcher to understand this function potential 
100 
through analysis of the complete genomic repertoire of the community, by sequencing 
101 
DNA extracted from that community, rather than relying on amplification of a marker 
102 
gene. Taxonomy can still be determined from signature genes (including 16S rRNA), but 
103 
it is also possible to assign phylogeny of the functional genes by comparing the DNA 
104 
sequence against a library of genomes from close relatives [20]. In addition, 
105 
metagenomics enables the assembly of genomes from organisms in the microbiome that 
106 
are resistant to culture, providing a higher resolution exploration of the taxa associated 
107 
with each person [21]. This enables us to determine the metabolic and signaling capacity 
108 
of each taxon, to determine how it will interact with the rest of the body [22]. This clearly 
109 
makes metagenomics of great interest for the development of precision medicine; 
110 
however, one must be aware of the challenges this technique presents. Metagenomic 
111 
studies are necessarily more expensive and computationally complex than 16S rRNA 
112 
based studies. Possible contamination from undesired DNA and biases of analyses 
113 
towards culturable organisms [23] further complicate matters. Ultimately metagenomics 
114 
is an extremely useful tool, but the application of this technology to precision medicine 
115 
will require a better understanding of the implications of these limitations, especially 
116 
when scaling up to treatments of large patient populations.  
117 
 7 
 
118 
Notably, both 16S sequencing and shotgun metagenomics are currently somewhat blunt 
119 
tools, especially when describing the fluid nature of the microbiome. Evolution of 
120 
microorganisms, horizontal transfer of genes, and subtleties in the characterization into 
121 
types of microbiomes [24] problematize the microbiome snapshot style data often 
122 
acquired. As sequencing costs continue to decrease, however, scientists can sample more 
123 
densely in time to capture previously unobservable subtleties in microbial interactions 
124 
and utilize time series techniques to uncover dynamic ecological phenomena [25]. 
125 
Additionally, the gut microbiome is known to be spatially inhomogeneous, in ways that 
126 
influence function and disease states [26]. This limitation too might be surpassed in the 
127 
near future, owing to emerging sampling techniques and protocols (e.g., laser 
128 
microdissection of colonic crypt mucus [27]). 
129 
 
130 
Avenues Towards Microbiome-Based Precision Therapies 
131 
Microbiome-xenobiotic interactions 
132 
That gene polymorphisms can drive changes in drug metabolism has been known for 
133 
some time; it was noted as early as 1957 that atypical forms of serum cholinesterase led 
134 
to potentially fatal reactions to certain anesthetics [28]. This and other adverse drug 
135 
reactions are estimated to cost from 30 to 130 billion dollars in the USA annually [29,30] 
136 
and are a significant source of patient non-compliance and therapy failure [31]. Reducing 
137 
these adverse reactions is a primary goal of precision medicine. While some interactions 
138 
are idiosyncratic, a recent survey of adverse drug events observed that about 35% of 
139 
these events were drug-gene or drug-drug-gene interactions involving cytochrome P450 
140 
 8 
oxidase (CYP) variants [32]. CYPs are generally considered the body’s innate and 
141 
primary general purpose drug metabolizers; they are involved in about 75% of total 
142 
human drug modification [33].  
143 
 
144 
However, microbial metabolism in the gut is also a significant factor in 
145 
biotransformation, especially for low solubility, low permeability compounds [34]. 
146 
Currently, more than 60 drugs have been identified to have microbiome interactions 
147 
according to the PharmacoMicrobiomics database [35], and given the vast number of 
148 
possible unique microbial metabolic transformations [36], many more interactions are 
149 
likely to be discovered compared with the apparently relatively limited number of human 
150 
genetic interactions. The plasticity of the microbiome may make these interactions 
151 
dynamic, necessitating precision medicine that is not only patient specific but temporarily 
152 
appropriate [37]. Importantly, the primary forms of xenobiotic metabolism are different 
153 
between human and bacterial cells: oxidation and conjugation dominate in the former 
154 
case, reduction and hydrolysis in the latter [34]. Metabolism of drugs is actually a key 
155 
component of many therapies; so-called “prodrugs” are essentially drugs that will be 
156 
metabolized into a pharmacologically active drug after consumption. Therefore, 
157 
production of active drug metabolites from prodrugs is sometimes dependent on the 
158 
microbiome, with the possibility to either improve or worsen outcomes [38]. This often 
159 
manifests as a modulation of bioavailability to the human, an important consideration for 
160 
prediction of appropriate dosing in precision medicine. Efficacy and side effects are also 
161 
altered directly by microbial metabolism. For example, acetaminophen toxicity shows 
162 
substantial variability within a given human population [39], and the microbiome has 
163 
 9 
been identified as playing a role in this variability. Members of the genus Clostridium, as 
164 
well as other bacteria can produce p-cresol, which competes as a substrate for SULT1A1 
165 
(a human liver enzyme) with acetaminophen [40]. A reduction in the breakdown of 
166 
acetaminophen by SULT1A1 causes a build-up of NAPQI, which leads to hepatotoxicity. 
167 
This general pattern of competition between bacterial metabolites and drugs for human 
168 
enzyme modification constitutes a major challenge in pharmacology [41]. Directly 
169 
harmful substances can also be formed by microbiota, as is the case in bacterial β-
170 
Glucuronidase mediated diarrhea in response to an antitumor camphothecin derivative 
171 
[42]. Strikingly, in some cases even strain level differences can lead to altered 
172 
metabolism, such as inactivation of digoxin by a non-universal E. lenta gene. Digoxin has 
173 
a narrow therapeutic window, and thus a wrong dosage could lead to significant toxicity, 
174 
highlighting the need for further study of metagenomic diagnostics and insights to 
175 
adverse outcomes [43].  
176 
 
177 
Furthermore, alternative mechanisms for xenobiotic-microbiome interaction including 
178 
immune [9,44,45] and endocrine [12] modulation by bacteria are known to exist, 
179 
complicating and enlarging the pool of possible drug-microbiome interactions. Lastly, 
180 
there are possible reciprocal relations: drugs may both be altered by the microbiome and 
181 
alter the microbiome. For example, antipsychotic medication has been shown to both 
182 
alter the microbiome and have microbiome-dependent side effects [46]. While this 
183 
greatly complicates endeavors to understand microbiota-xenobiotic interactions, it also 
184 
points towards a different microbiome driven approach to precision medicine: directly 
185 
targeting the microbiome for clinical results. 
186 
 10 
 
187 
Targeting the microbiome 
188 
It is clear that medication is already utilized to have a direct effect on the microbiome; 
189 
one needs to look no further than antibiotics. While these drugs are utilized for the 
190 
eradication of pathogenic bacteria, they have widespread effects on the microbiome, 
191 
possibly leading to adverse outcomes. Secondary infections caused by antibiotics are well 
192 
known, most saliently Clostridium difficile [47], but it is often less appreciated that 
193 
antibiotics can have side effects on the human, for instance fluoroquinolone associated 
194 
cardiotoxic [48] and neuropsychiatric [49] reactions. Importantly, consequences of 
195 
antibiotic usage, such as reduction of inflammation, are possibly not only human off-
196 
target drug effects, but also unintended consequences of microbial community disruption 
197 
[50]. Studies using mouse models suggest that stress induced increases in circulating 
198 
cytokines were abrogated by broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment [51]. Furthermore, 
199 
these types of interactions are not limited to drugs classified as antibiotics; many other 
200 
drugs have antibiotic and other microbial community structure and function modulating 
201 
properties that are beginning to be appreciated [52,53]. While many of these 
202 
perturbations to the microbiome are associated with poorer outcomes, some drugs may 
203 
derive some or all of their beneficial qualities from alteration of the microbiome, thus 
204 
they could be considered a form of discriminatory antibiotic.  
205 
 
206 
A precision medicine therapy that leverages microbial community structural modulation 
207 
could have beneficial clinical impact. Certainly if pathogen-specific antibiotics were 
208 
developed, the odds ratio could be greatly increased compared to traditional antibiotics. A 
209 
 11 
clear approach is to design a species-specific enzyme inhibitor or other antimicrobial 
210 
molecules. For example, a Streptococcus mutans-targeted drug based on the fusion of a 
211 
species-specific targeting peptide domain with a wide-spectrum antimicrobial peptide 
212 
domain has already been developed [54]. However, the bacterial community was also 
213 
altered when using this peptide, despite its high specificity [55]. This is likely because the 
214 
environment of Streptococcus mutans, the oral microbiome, presents significant 
215 
structural and functional complexity [56]. It has been suggested that targeted antibiotics 
216 
may shift the microbiome into a healthier state, but of course there is also the potential 
217 
for negative ecological effects, although these may be less than for traditional antibiotics. 
218 
 
219 
An intriguing approach that may largely avoid the problem of system scale changes in 
220 
microbial community structure, as well as that of increasing antimicrobial resistance, is to 
221 
non-lethally target specific enzymes in the bacteria. This has been realized at the multi-
222 
species level [57] through targeted inhibition of bacterial tri-methyl amine (TMA) 
223 
formation by 3,3-Dimethyl-1-butanol (DMB, a structural analog of choline) ultimately 
224 
attenuating atherosclerosis in a high choline diet mouse model. Surprisingly, slight 
225 
alterations of bacterial composition were still observed, underscoring the extremely 
226 
dynamic nature of the microbiome. Nonetheless, this study points towards a microbiome-
227 
based intervention for a specific (i.e., “Western”) diet-driven disease. In this case, a 
228 
single target approach is undesirable, as reduction of global TMA formation is the goal, 
229 
but given the availability of single isozyme inhibitors [58], precision, non-lethal drugs 
230 
likely could be developed. These furthermore have the potential to be minimally 
231 
bioavailable to the human, limiting side effects, and might be exploited not only to target 
232 
 12 
pathogens but also to reduce microbiota-drug interactions through selective elimination 
233 
of problem microbes.  
234 
 
235 
A final approach for targeted antimicrobials has been successfully employed for 
236 
approximately 100 years, though not as popularly in the western world [59]. Phages were 
237 
independently discovered in France and England, though developed as a therapy first in 
238 
the former. Despite great successes in treatment, especially of cholera, commercialization 
239 
of phage therapy failed due to production problems and other complications and so was 
240 
subsequently ignored in the US and Europe after the development of antibiotics [60]. 
241 
Scientists in the Soviet Union (especially Georgia) continued to develop phage therapy, 
242 
having been cut off from antibiotic advances due to World War II. Here it was effectively 
243 
used it to control outbreaks of gastrointestinal diseases and refined further during the 
244 
Cold War and afterwards [61]. The basic premise of this technique is that many bacterial 
245 
species, and maybe even each strain (sub-species), are predated upon by a unique phage 
246 
[62]. Phage target bacteria cell-membrane protein and sugar complexes that are unique to 
247 
each bacterial taxon. Therefore, by identifying the correct phage it should be possible to 
248 
precisely remove a specific bacterial species from an assemblage. This will enable 
249 
accurate restructuring of a microbiome so as to precisely augment the functional 
250 
properties of that consortium. In fact, recent evidence from the commercial sector 
251 
suggests that the same mechanisms employed by phages to target and penetrate bacterial 
252 
cells can be programmed into nano-particles that mimic these phage-properties to infect 
253 
and kill specific cells (Pers. Comm. Jeffrey Miller, UCLA). In this new future, we may 
254 
have ultimate control over the microbiome. 
255 
 13 
 
256 
Prebiotic treatments 
257 
Conversely, instead of targeting the microbiome to reduce deleterious bacteria, one could 
258 
aim to increase the levels of beneficial bacteria or otherwise positively alter the structure 
259 
or function of the microbiome. Substances applied in this way are often referred to as 
260 
prebiotics. However, the types of prebiotics currently studied are limited in scope, usually 
261 
non-digestible fiber compounds that stimulate growth of Bifidobacterium and other taxa 
262 
to produce short chain fatty acids (SCFA) including butyrate and propionate [63]. 
263 
Though this is promising as a broad treatments for several conditions [64], efforts for 
264 
precision medicine in this sphere will require the expansion of the scope of prebiotics. 
265 
Given that metagenomic and metabolomic advances continue to better characterize the 
266 
metabolic potential of the microbiome, especially across groups with vastly different 
267 
diets [65], prebiotic compounds that stimulate alternative beneficial bacteria towards 
268 
useful metabolic endpoints will be discovered [66].  
269 
 
270 
More audaciously, one might aim at fine-tuning the interactions between microbiota of 
271 
the gut microbiome. The microbiome is a complex, human co-evolved ecosystem that 
272 
produces many bioactive compounds, often for intercellular communication [26]. These 
273 
compounds could be mined to find those which modulate the microbiome in a beneficial 
274 
way, thus unearthing novel prebiotics [67]. While microbial community disruption is the 
275 
consequence of both xenobiotic and microbiome targeted drug metabolism, these types of 
276 
prebiotics might provide a more gentle perturbation than possible with the former by 
277 
harnessing already existing biological pathways. This goal certainly seems distant, but as 
278 
 14 
dynamical systems approaches to studying the microbiome continue to develop, we may 
279 
find that treating certain dysbiotic states require perturbations of varying magnitudes or 
280 
delicate maintenance of the stability of the microbiome, especially in at-risk populations 
281 
[68]. 
282 
 
283 
Precision probiotics 
284 
Perhaps the most direct strategy for altering the microbiome is the usage of probiotics, 
285 
live microbes administered for health benefits. This idea has been employed since at least 
286 
1907 when Élie Metchnikoff hypothesized lactic acid producing bacteria could implant in 
287 
the gastrointestinal tract to enhance longevity [69]. Today the probiotic landscape is still 
288 
dominated by lactic acid bacteria, specifically genera Lactobacillus, though it is now 
289 
appreciated that their beneficial properties are not limited to the production of a single 
290 
metabolite and that other potential probiotic bacteria, perhaps isolated from healthy 
291 
individuals [70], could affect various outcomes through multifarious means [71]. This 
292 
opens the door to precision probiotic development since application of microorganisms is 
293 
highly specific with regards to both applied agent and effect. Devices now exist for 
294 
isolating microorganisms based on metabolic output [72], and work is being done to 
295 
identify probiotic bacteria that produce particular compounds of therapeutic potential 
296 
[73]. This may include compounds whose efficacies are contingent on route of 
297 
administration, for example those that are inactive orally. Furthermore, probiotics are 
298 
being bioengineered to expand their ranges and modes of actions as well as their 
299 
robustness and incorporation [74]. However, it is important to keep in mind that 
300 
interactions with diet, established microbiota, and genetics, are known to modulate 
301 
 15 
overall health outcomes if not specific effects and mechanisms of probiotics [71]. 
302 
Therefore effective patient classification and stratification is required for best results. 
303 
Success of this program will require detailed insights into metagenomic potential and 
304 
ecological interactions of presumptive probiotic bacteria, making precision probiotic 
305 
development a task of considerable difficulty but one that has already seen demonstrable 
306 
results, for example in enhancing resistance to Clostridium difficile infection [75] and 
307 
suppressing hepatocellular carcinoma growth in mice [76].  
308 
 
309 
Regulation and Application 
310 
Despite the therapeutic promise of the microbiome, its application to precision medicine 
311 
requires overcoming considerable hurdles. One may anticipate that failure to successfully 
312 
apply genomic medicine may lead to delays in the application of the microbiome as a 
313 
precision therapy. For example, the current legal and R&D model is not well suited for 
314 
development of genome-informed drugs [77]. Microbiome therapies likewise face 
315 
difficulties, especially owing to the wide breadth of treatment options, many of which 
316 
lack analogs in current medical practice. Furthermore, clinicians have been reticent to use 
317 
the results of genomic information — and thus likely future microbiome data — in 
318 
treatment due to both uncertainties on its importance and lack of understanding [78]. 
319 
These problems are highlighted in the case of Plavix® (clopidogrel), whereby despite an 
320 
FDA box warning [79] indicating serious or fatal risk for those carrying certain 
321 
CYP2C19 variants, this drug is still routinely used on genetically incompatible patients 
322 
due to poor coverage by insurance and failure to clinically utilize genetic testing [80]. In 
323 
the case of the microbiome, fecal transplant treatment for Clostridium difficile colitis is 
324 
 16 
known to be highly effective especially in recurrent infection [81]; however, this 
325 
procedure still requires a licensed practitioner to have a protocol approved by their local 
326 
Institutional Review Board, and therefore each patient needs to be consented prior to 
327 
therapy. For a therapy with >90% success rate this is peculiar. However, it is because we 
328 
still lack the ability to characterize the microbial community of donor stool appropriately. 
329 
This means that we do not know the active components of the fecal transplant, and 
330 
therefore it is very difficult to regulate this using standard legislation under FDA 
331 
protocols. More importantly, we still don’t fully understand the implications for 
332 
microbiome therapy on a large scale. While fecal transplants are becoming extremely 
333 
numerous with few legitimate side effects, it is still hard to predict the outcome across a 
334 
broad population. The same is true for genomic medicine, whereby the interaction of 
335 
genes with the environment is difficult to predict [82]. This requires enormous sample 
336 
populations for any investigation to be statistically significant [83]. Though the future is 
337 
bright for genomic medicine, particular issues currently impede efforts towards its 
338 
development. 
339 
 
340 
Fortunately, some of the difficulties in genomic medicine research and deployment might 
341 
be lessened in precision microbiome medicine. Environmental-microbiome interactions 
342 
are potentially more easily studied because there is a more direct interaction between the 
343 
two, allowing for simpler identification of sample populations and achievement of 
344 
statistical power. With the correct experimental design, genetic variation can be 
345 
sufficiently decoupled from microbiome and environmental factors. In fact, studies of 
346 
this nature already exist, both on humans [84] and especially on mice, where genetics can 
347 
 17 
be well controlled [85]. This bottom-up approach can then be extended by genomic 
348 
studies which better account for confounding factors. Even where genetics is a significant 
349 
factor, such as in mental health disorders, incorporating the microbiome greatly increases 
350 
understanding and ultimately treatment of diseases [86]. Of course in disease states where 
351 
the effects of genetic variation are either entirely or nearly absent, the microbiome is a 
352 
great candidate for investigation. Conditions such as obesity [87] and inflammatory 
353 
bowel disease [88] can in subsets of patients be driven by dysbiosis, a chronic, systemic 
354 
maladaptation of the gut microbiome to the host. Unlike genomic medicine, there are 
355 
possibilities especially for these conditions to do research in an in vitro environment, 
356 
most excitingly in artificial gut paradigms [89]. Microbiome precision medicine also has 
357 
the opportunity to break free of present R&D and legal hurdles to precision medicine. 
358 
The regulation and marketing of these treatments will at least pose challenges for 
359 
traditional models [90,91], as evidenced by the FDA’s current stance on probiotics [92], 
360 
which has led to faster product delivery to the public but also quality control and 
361 
effectiveness issues [93]. Prioritizing treatments will be an important aspect of achieving 
362 
R&D, FDA, and ultimately clinician support; unnecessary testing on low risk 
363 
communities and for low benefit interventions, will only hamper the development of 
364 
microbiome precision medicine. 
365 
 
366 
Notable Application: Medically Underserved Communities 
367 
Given the above unique assets of the microbiome modality of precision medicine, a 
368 
promising potential area for its development is in low socio-economic status (SES) and 
369 
other under-served communities. Low SES is associated with reduced diversity in the gut 
370 
 18 
microbiome [94]. Numerous factors are also present especially in urban communities that 
371 
reduce immunoregulation, including reduced exposure to microbes in the natural 
372 
environment [95] and increased stress [96], and increase obesity prevalence and 
373 
dysbiosis, including increased density of fast-food restaurants [97] and lack of physical 
374 
activity [98]. This is likely interrelated with microbiome-associated diseases such as 
375 
asthma [99] and gastrointestinal symptoms [100]. The vast majority of genomic variants 
376 
discovered are either rare with large effects or common with small effects, unlike in this 
377 
situation where there is a possibility of appreciable effect size combined with biomarker 
378 
occurrence. Therefore, these at-risk communities present a potentially illuminating cohort 
379 
for microbiome.  
380 
 
381 
Of course, great care must be taken to not draw inappropriate or invalid associations 
382 
between microbiome [101] (or genome [102]) variations and minority status. Lack of 
383 
cultural understanding and disparities in access to services have driven poor research 
384 
trends in the past and continue to be a deep issue in the development of precision 
385 
medicine. Access issues in particular have caused demonstrable problems; statistics on 
386 
epidermal growth factor receptor testing, for example, show associations of lower 
387 
educational attainment and income with reduced likelihood of testing [103], and studies 
388 
suggest health insurance coverage alone does not explain this general effect [104,105]. 
389 
For precision medicine to succeed then, under-served populations must be both active 
390 
participants and beneficiaries of research. Microbiome research in particular could lead to 
391 
high impact clinical interventions for these communities, hopefully spurring its 
392 
development. It is both an opportunity and imperative for microbiome precision medicine 
393 
 19 
to address social epidemiological trends, but this is only possible through the combined 
394 
efforts of researchers, clinicians, the government, and perhaps most importantly the 
395 
people at large. 
396 
 
397 
Concluding Remarks 
398 
Here we have presented a collection of potential avenues towards introducing the 
399 
microbiome into precision medicine. Though it is difficult to know if and when these 
400 
techniques will ultimately make it to the clinic (see Outstanding Questions), there is 
401 
substantial evidence that microbiome-based medicine holds great future potential to 
402 
improve odds-ratios, reduce side effects, stratify patients, and precisely treat previously 
403 
difficult or untreatable conditions. Ultimately, the microbiome must become an integral 
404 
part of precision medicine as a whole, since so much of human functioning and 
405 
metabolism is dependent upon it. If this is to happen in the near future, as it hopefully 
406 
should, we must better understand the microbiome and its interactions with the human 
407 
and the environment via a concerted effort and conversation between researchers, 
408 
clinicians, patients, the government, and most importantly, the broader community.

Figure 1 
411 
A schematic of methods in precision microbiome medicine and their possible interplay: 
412 
a) As an example, certain microbes, here represented in red, metabolize the compound 
413 
cycasin to produce a carcinogenic compound methylazoxymethanol (MAM) [106]. This 
414 
functional potential of the microbe might be discovered through metagenomic 
415 
sequencing. b) If targeted removal of the red microorganism — identified in a patient via 
416 
 20 
16S sequencing — was desired, without harming commensal bacteria, represented in 
417 
shades of blue, three approaches (green arrows) might be utilized. Direct removal of the 
418 
deleterious microorganism through targeted antibiotics ideally would not affect 
419 
commensal bacteria. Probiotic treatment introduces new beneficial microorganisms while 
420 
prebiotic treatment favors the growth of existing beneficial microorganisms. Note that 
421 
prebiotic and probiotic treatments do not directly remove the targeted microorganism, but 
422 
in certain cases may shift the gut ecology such that it does not thrive [107]. In all three 
423 
cases, the specific circumstances may affect which treatment is best employed and what 
424 
residual outcomes there are on the microbiome.

 Outstanding Questions 
 
What is the relative significance of specific microbial actors versus whole microbiome 
ecology in disease states, and how will drugging specific bacteria affect ecological 
succession following this perturbation? How will this depend on the milieu in which a 
species is situated (e.g., presence of different taxa performing a similar ecological role)? 
Additionally, what roles might phages, fungi, viruses play? 
 
How closely coupled are genetics and the microbiome, and how can these fields be 
integrated into a unified practice of precision medicine?  
 
Which microbiome-driven disease states can be successfully cured? Which instead 
require prophylactic or palliative, noncurative therapy?  
 
What is the best way to move precision microbiome medicine results out into the clinic? 
What changes in regulatory, governmental as well as research and development processes 
will need to occur for this to happen? 
 
How will the needs of different groups be best addressed across diets, lifestyles, and 
environments? What interventions will ultimately require social change rather than 
medical therapy, and what will the interplay between these fields be?
