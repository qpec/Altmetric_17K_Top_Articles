SUMMARY
In auditory fear conditioning, experimental subjects
learn to associate an auditory conditioned stimulus
(CS) with an aversive unconditioned stimulus. With
sufficient training, animals fear conditioned to an
auditory CS show fear response to the CS, but not
to irrelevant auditory stimuli. Although long-term
potentiation (LTP) in the lateral amygdala (LA) plays
an essential role in auditory fear conditioning, it is
unknown whether LTP is induced selectively in
the neural pathways conveying specific CS infor-
mation to the LA in discriminative fear learning.
Here, we show that postsynaptically expressed
LTP is induced selectively in the CS-specific audi-
tory pathways to the LA in a mouse model of auditory
discriminative fear conditioning. Moreover, optoge-
netically induced depotentiation of the CS-specific
auditory pathways to the LA suppressed conditioned
fear responses to the CS. Our results suggest that
input-specific LTP in the LA contributes to fear mem-
ory specificity, enabling adaptive fear responses only
to the relevant sensory cue.
INTRODUCTION
To survive in a dynamic environment, animals develop fear re-
sponses to dangerous situations. For these adaptive fear re-
sponses to be developed, the brain must discriminate between
different sensory cues and associate only relevant stimuli with
aversive events. In auditory fear conditioning, an experimental
model of fear learning, experimental subjects learn to associate
an emotionally neutral auditory conditioned stimulus (CS; e.g., a
tone) with an aversive unconditioned stimulus (US; e.g., electric
foot shock), displaying conditioned fear responses (e.g., freezing
behavior) to the neutral CS (LeDoux, 2000; Maren, 2001; Tovote
et al., 2015). With sufficient training, animals fear conditioned to
an auditory stimulus show fear responses to the same stimulus,
but not to irrelevant auditory stimuli. It is poorly understood at the
neuronal and synaptic levels how animals discriminate between
auditory stimuli to show fear responses selectively to the relevant
stimulus.
Long-term potentiation (LTP) in the amygdala plays an
essential role in the formation of conditioned fear memory
(Cho et al., 2011; McKernan and Shinnick-Gallagher, 1997;
Nabavi et al., 2014; Rogan et al., 1997; Rumpel et al., 2005; Tsvet-
kov et al., 2002). After fear conditioning, synaptic strength is
enhanced in the auditory CS pathways to the lateral nucleus of
the amygdala (LA), such that presentation of the CS alone is suf-
ficient to activate the amygdala and its downstream brain areas
(Tovote et al., 2016), resulting in fear responses to the CS. A spe-
cific auditory CS activates only a subset of neurons in the auditory
cortex (ACx) and thalamus (medial geniculate nucleus, MGN),
which convey CS information to the amygdala for the CS-US as-
sociation. Thus, LTP may be induced selectively in neural circuits
conveying specific CS signals to the amygdala for encoding fear
memory for the CS. After fear conditioning with the auditory CS+,
auditory-evoked single-unit activity and local field potential in the
LA are enhanced more robustly to the CS+ (a relevant stimulus)
than to the CS– (an irrelevant stimulus), suggesting a selective in-
crease in the responsiveness of LA neurons to the CS+ (Collins
and Pare
´ , 2000; Ghosh and Chattarji, 2015; Goosens et al.,
2003). However, it has not been determined whether LTP is
induced selectively in neural pathways conveying specific CS in-
formation to the amygdala in discriminative fear learning. If LTP in
the CS-specific pathways confers fear memory specificity, fear
memory for the CS could be erased selectively by depotentiation,
reversing the input-specific LTP. However, it has not been exam-
ined whether depotentiation in the CS-specific pathways to the
amygdala suppresses fear memory for the CS.
To determine the synaptic mechanisms of how discriminative
fear memory for a specific CS is encoded in the amygdala, we
tested our hypothesis that specific fear memory is encoded by
selective LTP in neural pathways defined by presynaptic inputs
conveying specific CS information to the amygdala. Using a com-
bined approach of neural activity-dependent behavioral labeling
(Guenthner et al., 2013), optogenetic stimulations (Yizhar et al.,
2011), and electrophysiological recordings (Cho et al., 2013),
we found that postsynaptically expressed LTP was induced
selectively in the CS-specific ACx/MGN-LA pathways after audi-
tory discriminative fear conditioning in mice, whereas LTP was
not detected in randomly selected ACx/MGN-LA pathways.
Moreover, optogenetically induced depotentiation of the CS-
specific ACx/MGN-LA pathways prevented the recall of fear
memory for the auditory CS. Thus, input-specific LTP in the LA
could contribute to fear memory specificity, enabling adaptive
fear responses only to the relevant sensory cue.

 RESULTS
Behavioral Labeling of ACx/MGN Neurons Responding
to a Specific Auditory Stimulus
To examine synaptic changes in the auditory CS-specific
pathways to the LA, we employed a behavioral labeling
approach with Fos-CreERT2 knockin mice (Guenthner et al.,
2013). We injected adeno-associated virus (AAV) encoding the
eYFP gene in a double inverse open reading frame (DIO) (AAV-
pEF1a-DIO-eYFP) into ACx and MGN in heterozygous Fos-
CreERT2 mice (Figure 1A) and exposed them to a 4 or 12 kHz
tone (5 s duration, 15 s interval) for 30 min after tamoxifen admin-
istration (Figures 1B and S1A). A population of ACx/MGN
neurons responding to the tone expressed CreERT2 under the
control of an activity-dependent endogenous c-Fos promoter,
which then induced the recombination of the DIO in the presence
of tamoxifen, resulting in permanent eYFP expression (Fig-
ure 1C). Two weeks after the behavioral labeling, eYFP expres-
sion was detected in a subset of ACx/MGN neurons (Figure 1D).
Within the amygdala, eYFP-labeled projections were found
predominantly in the LA (Figure 1E). Without tamoxifen injection
before tone exposure, eYFP expression was detected in only a
few neurons in ACx and MGN (Figure S1B).
Next, we quantified the proportion of behaviorally labeled
neurons among ACx/MGN neurons projecting to the LA. We in-
jected AAV-pEF1a-DIO-eYFP to ACx and MGN and retrograde
herpes simplex virus (HSV) encoding the mCherry gene into
the LA in Fos-CreERT2 mice (Figure 1F). After the behavioral
labeling, tone-responding ACx/MGN neurons were labeled with
eYFP, whereas LA-projecting neurons were labeled with mCherry
(Figures 1G and S1C). Our behavioral labeling resulted in eYFP
expression in 14.6% ± 2.3% and 12.5% ± 1.9% of ACx and
MGN neurons projecting to the LA, respectively (mean ± SEM,
7 mice; Figure 1H). The proportion was significantly higher in
tone-exposed mice compared with mice left in home cages under
auditorydeprivation (Figure1H; TableS1),indicating thatbehavior-
allylabeledneuronsincludedtone-respondingACx/MGNneurons.
To examine the specificity of our behavioral labeling method,
we labeled ACx/MGN neurons with different fluorescent proteins
during the first and second tone exposures. We injected
AAV-pEF1a-DIO-mCherry into ACx and MGN in Fos-CreERT2 3
Fos-shGFP mice, which express both CreERT2 and short half-
life (2 hr) GFP (shGFP) under the control of the c-Fos promoter
(Reijmers et al., 2007) (Figures 1I and S1D). After receiving
tamoxifen, these mice were exposed to a 4 or 12 kHz tone or
left in home cages (HCs) for mCherry expression in ACx and
MGN (Figures 1J and S1E). Two weeks later, the mice were
exposed to a 4 kHz tone for shGFP expression, and the brain tis-
sues were fixed 90 min later. The proportion of double-labeled
ACx/MGN neurons (mCherry+/shGFP+) among all mCherry+
neurons was significantly higher in mice exposed to the same
tone (4 kHz-4 kHz tone) than in mice exposed to different tones
(12 kHz-4 kHz tone) or in mice of the HC-4 kHz tone group
(Figures 1J, 1K, S1E, and S1F; Table S1). These results indicate
the specificity of our behavioral labeling approach.
LA Neuronal Ensemble Defined by Presynaptic
ACx/MGN Inputs Conveying Specific Auditory
Information
With our behavioral labeling approach, we examined how each
LA neuron received ACx/MGN inputs conveying specific audi-
tory information. We injected AAV-pEF1a-DIO-ChR2-eYFP into
ACx and MGN in Fos-CreERT2 mice and exposed them to a
4 or 12 kHz tone after tamoxifen administration (Figures 2A
and 2B). Three weeks later, tone-responding ACx/MGN neurons
expressed ChR2-eYFP, and eYFP-labeled projections were
found in the LA (Figure 2C). To induce synaptic responses in
the tone-specific ACx/MGN-LA pathways, we applied blue light
illumination to activate ChR2-expressing axons in the LA in brain
slices and recorded postsynaptic responses in principal neurons
of the LA using a whole-cell patch-clamp technique (Figures 2A,
2D, and 2E). Short pulses of photostimulation induced mono-
synaptic excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) at –80 mV in
voltage-clamp mode, which were completely blocked by gluta-
mate receptor antagonists, indicating that these EPSCs were
mediated by glutamate (p < 0.01, paired t test; Figures 2D and
S2A–S2D; Table S2). Both ACx and MGN axons labeled with
different fluorescent proteins were detected in the LA, suggest-
ing their role in conveying auditory information to the amygdala
(Figures S2E–S2G). Independent photostimulations of either
the tone-labeled ACx or MGN axons induced EPSCs in the
same LA neurons, indicating that LA neurons received inputs
from both ACx and MGN conveying specific auditory information
(Figures S2H–S2K).
The peak amplitude of EPSCs recorded in the tone-specific
ACx/MGN-LA pathways was proportional to the light power

 density (Figure S2L). EPSCs recorded in different LA neurons in
the same brain slice were heterogeneous (Figures 2F–2H), and
the distribution of EPSC amplitude was highly skewed (Fig-
ure 2G). Moreover, robust EPSCs were detected only in a subset
of LA neurons, whereas 64.3% of the LA neurons displayed
either no synaptic responses or EPSCs with modest amplitude
(<100 pA; Figure 2G). However, when ACx/MGN neurons glob-
ally expressed ChR2 and their axons were randomly stimulated
as in Figure 2I, the EPSC amplitude was much larger but
normally distributed (p = 0.13, Anderson-Darling normality
test), with less variability than EPSCs in tone-specific ACx/
MGN-LA pathways (Figures 2J–2L, S2L, and S2M). Together,
these results suggest that a subset of LA neurons preferentially
receive presynaptic ACx/MGN inputs relaying specific auditory
information (Figures S2N–S2Q) (Gr€
undemann and L€
uthi, 2015).
Postsynaptically Expressed LTP Was Induced in the
CS+ Pathways to the LA in Auditory Discriminative
Fear Conditioning
To investigate the synaptic mechanisms of fear memory speci-
ficity, we developed a behavioral protocol for discriminative
auditory fear conditioning, in which mice were trained to show
conditioned fear response (e.g., freezing behavior) selectively
to an auditory cue, CS+ (Figures 3A and S3A–S3C). After
single-trial fear conditioning, in which CS+ (4 or 12 kHz tone,
counterbalanced) was presented paired with the US (foot shock,
0.5 mA, 2 s duration), mice displayed non-discriminative fear to
both the CS+ and CS–, which was not paired with the US
(day 2 in Figures 3B and 3C). After multiple-trial fear conditioning,
however, mice showed fear selectively to the CS+ (day 6 in Fig-
ures 3B and 3C) with better discrimination between the CS+ and
CS– (p < 0.001, paired t test; Figure 3C).
We next examined how synaptic efficacy changes in the
ACx/MGN inputs conveying CS+ information to the LA in
discriminative fear conditioning. As we were unable to predict
whether LTP would be induced in both the ACx-LA and MGN-LA
pathways or would be confined to either of these two pathways
in discriminative fear conditioning, we first examined LTP in
these
pathways
altogether.
We
injected
AAV-pEF1a-DIO-
ChR2-eYFP into both ACx and MGN in Fos-CreERT2 mice to
induce ChR2 expression in ACx/MGN neurons responding to
the CS+ (Figures 3D–3F). After behavioral labeling, mice in the
fear conditioning (FC) group were trained for discriminative fear
learning (Figures 3A and 3E) and displayed discriminative fear
to the CS+ (Figures 3G and S3D). Mice in the no shock (NS) con-
trol group received the CS+ and CS– as in the FC group but
without the US and did not show fear responses to either the
CS+ or CS– (Figure 3G). In brain slices from these mice, we
recorded EPSCs in principal neurons in the LA, which were
differentiated from GABAergic interneurons based on their pas-
sive membrane properties (Figures S4A–S4D). Photostimula-
tions of ChR2-expressing axons in the LA induced EPSCs, which
reflect postsynaptic responses in the CS+ pathways to the LA
(Figures 3D and 3H). The induction of LTP and long-term depres-
sion (LTD) in the ACx/MGN-LA pathways in brain slices was
accompanied by changes in the AMPA/NMDA EPSC ratio
(Figures S4E–S4L), which correlated with the magnitude of LTP
and LTD (Figure S4M; correlation coefficient r = 0.89; p <
0.001), suggesting that the changes in the AMPA/NMDA
ratio reliably reflect long-term synaptic plasticity in the ACx/
MGN-LA pathways (Kauer et al., 1988; Muller et al., 1988).
Thus, to detect changes in synaptic strength in the CS+ path-
ways by postsynaptic expression mechanisms in discriminative
fear learning, we compared the AMPA/NMDA ratio between the
FC and NS groups. We recorded both AMPA receptor (AMPAR)-
and NMDA receptor (NMDAR)-mediated EPSCs in the same LA
neurons and calculated the AMPA/NMDA ratio (Figure 3H). The
AMPA/NMDA ratio was significantly higher in the FC group
than in the NS group (Figures 3H–3J; main effect of groups,
p < 0.001; main effect of tone frequency, p = 0.90; groups 3
tone frequency interaction, p = 0.49; two-way ANOVA), whereas
the passive membrane properties of recorded LA neurons were
not different between groups (Table S3). In 19.4% of all the LA
neurons in the FC group, the AMPA/NMDA ratio was larger
than the average AMPA/NMDA ratio in the NS group by more
than two SDs (Figure 3I), suggesting that these LA neurons un-
derwent LTP in the CS+ pathways (Rumpel et al., 2005).
Enhanced synaptic efficacy in the CS+ pathways was de-
tected only when the CS+ was presented temporally paired
with the US on the training day (p < 0.05, unpaired t test, paired
versus unpaired CS+/US; Figures S3F and S5A–S5C), suggest-
ing that LTP in these pathways was not due to nonspecific effect
of the US. As ACx and MGN inputs can convey distinct infor-
mation to the LA and play different roles in discriminative fear
conditioning (Antunes and Moita, 2010), we examined these
pathways separately and found that the AMPA/NMDA ratio
was significantly higher in the FC group than in the NS group in
the ACx-LA pathway (p < 0.05, unpaired t test; Figures S5D–
S5F), but not in the MGN-LA pathway (p = 0.63, unpaired t
test; Figures S5G and S5H), indicating postsynaptically ex-
pressed LTP was selectively induced in the ACx-LA pathway in
discriminative fear learning. In the ACx/MGN inputs to the amyg-
dalo-striatal transition area (ASt), we did not detect significant
difference in the AMPA/NMDA ratio between groups (p = 0.35,
unpaired t test; Figures S5I–S5K), suggesting that LTP associ-
ated with discriminative fear learning is pathway specific.
To detect changes in synaptic efficacy by presynaptic expres-
sion mechanisms, we examined progressive block of NMDAR
EPSC by MK-801, which inhibited NMDAR gradually upon
repeated
photostimulation
(Figures
S4N
and
S4O).
We
compared between groups the decay constant of the NMDAR
EPSC, which is inversely related to presynaptic release probabil-
ity (Hessler et al., 1993; Rosenmund et al., 1993). There was no
significant difference in the NMDAR EPSC decay constant

that discriminative fear learning did not affect presynaptic
release probability in the CS+ pathways to the LA.
Postsynaptically Expressed LTP Was Not Detected in
the CS– Pathways to the LA in Auditory Discrimination
Fear Learning
In discriminative fear learning, mice initially displayed fear to the
auditory CS–, which gradually decreased after multiple-trial fear
conditioning (Figures 3A–3C). We hypothesized that reduced
fear to the CS– was due to the lack of LTP in the pathways
conveying CS– information to the LA. We tested this hypothesis
by examining how synaptic efficacy changed in the CS– path-
ways in discriminative fear conditioning (Figure 4A). For behav-
ioral labeling, we exposed mice to the auditory CS– to induce
ChR2 expression in ACx/MGN neurons responding to the CS–
(Figures 4B and 4C). As in previous experiments, mice in the
FC group received the CS+ paired with the US, whereas mice

 in the NS control group received the CS+ and CS– without the
US. After discriminative fear conditioning, mice in the FC group
displayed robust freezing behavior to the CS+ but a much lower
fear response to the CS– (Figures 4D and S3E). In brain slices, we
photostimulated ACx/MGN axons conveying the CS� informa-
tion and recorded EPSCs in LA neurons (Figures 4A and 4E). In
the CS– pathways to the LA, there was no difference in the
AMPA/NMDA EPSC ratio between the FC and NS groups (Fig-
ures 4E–4G; main effect of groups, p = 0.95; main effect of
tone frequency, p = 1.00; groups 3 tone frequency interaction,
p = 0.86; two-way ANOVA). For presynaptically expressed syn-
aptic changes, we compared the rate of progressive block of
NMDAR EPSC by MK-801 and found no significant difference
in the decay constant between groups (p = 0.40, unpaired t
test; Figures S4Q–S4S). These results suggest that synaptic ef-
ficacy did not change in the CS– pathways to the LA by either
presynaptic or postsynaptic mechanisms in discriminative fear
learning. We also analyzed the effects of behaviorally labeled
auditory pathways (CS+ versus CS– pathways) and behavioral
groups (FC versus NS) on the AMPA/NMDA EPSC ratio and
found a significant pathways 3 groups interaction (p < 0.01,
two-way ANOVA; Figures 3J and 4G; Table S1), indicating that
postsynaptically expressed LTP was induced in the CS+ path-
ways, but not in the CS– pathways to the LA in discriminative
fear conditioning (Figure 4H).
LTP Was Not Induced Globally in the ACx/MGN-LA
Pathways in Discriminative Fear Learning
In discriminative fear learning, postsynaptically expressed LTP
was detected in the auditory CS+, but not CS–, pathways to
the LA. We next investigated whether discriminative fear condi-
tioning globally induced LTP in the ACx/MGN-LA pathways by
examining synaptic efficacy in randomly selected ACx/MGN-
LA synapses while excluding the contribution of the LTP in the
CS+ pathways for our assay. To this end, we co-injected AAV-
pCaMKIIa-ChR2-eYFP and AAV-pEF1a-DIO-eArch3-eYFP into
ACx and MGN in Fos-CreERT2 mice. ChR2 was expressed
globally in ACx/MGN under the control of the CaMKIIa promoter,
whereas eArch3 expression was limited to ACx/MGN neurons
responding to the auditory CS+ after behavioral labeling (Figures
5A and 5B). We then trained mice in the FC group for discrimina-
tive fear to the CS+ (Figure 5C). Mice in the NS group did not
show fear responses to either the CS+ or CS–. In brain slices,
we globally activated ACx/MGN inputs to the LA with ChR2-acti-
vating blue light while silencing the CS+ pathways with eArch3-
activating orange light. Illumination with both blue and orange
lights significantly reduced EPSC amplitude by 13.1% ± 2.2%
(mean ± SEM, n = 36 neurons) compared with that of EPSCs
induced by blue light alone (p < 0.001, paired t test; Figure 5D).
The effect was mediated by eArch3 expressed in a subset of
the
ACx/MGN-LA
pathways
(Figures
S6A–S6D).
Effective
silencing of the CS+ pathways was further confirmed in another
experiment, in which both ChR2 and eArch3 were expressed
selectively in CS+-responding ACx/MGN neurons (Figures
S6E–S6G). With this approach, we recorded EPSCs in randomly
selected ACx/MGN-LA pathways to the LA, excluding synaptic
responses in the CS+-specific synapses. Under this condition,
the AMPA/NMDA EPSC ratio was not significantly different
between the FC and NS groups (p = 0.91, unpaired t test; Figures
5E and 5F), suggesting that postsynaptically expressed LTP was
not induced globally in the ACx/MGN-LA pathways in discrimi-
native fear conditioning.
Consistently, we did not detect a significant difference in the
AMPA/NMDA EPSC ratio between groups when we globally
photostimulated the ACx/MGN-LA pathways, including the
CS+ pathways (p = 0.40, unpaired t test; Figures 5G–5K). Un-
der this condition, there was no significant difference between
groups in the rate of progressive block of NMDAR EPSC by
MK-801 (p = 0.83, unpaired t test; Figures 5L and 5M) or
paired-pulse ratio, which is inversely related to the presynaptic
release probability (Zucker and Regehr, 2002) (main effect of
groups, p = 0.48; groups 3 intensity interaction, p = 0.10,
repeated-measures two-way ANOVA; Figures 5N and 5O).
These results suggest that LTP by either presynaptic or post-
synaptic expression mechanisms was not induced globally in
the ACx/MGN-LA pathways. Moreover, we did not detect a sig-
nificant difference between groups in either the amplitude or
frequency of spontaneous EPSCs (sEPSCs), which reflect
synaptic responses in nonspecific presynaptic inputs to the
LA (p = 0.34 and p = 0.66 for sEPSC amplitude and fre-
quency, respectively, unpaired t test; Figures S6H–S6L). Taken
together, our results suggest that LTP was not induced globally
in the ACx/MGN-LA pathways in auditory discriminative fear
conditioning.

 LTP Was Preferentially Induced in the Auditory
CS+ Inputs to a Subset of LA Neurons Activated during
Fear Conditioning
Our results demonstrate that postsynaptically expressed LTP is
selectively induced in the inputs conveying CS+ information to
the LA in auditory discriminative fear learning (Figures 3, 4, and
5) and the input-specific LTP was detected in only a small
population (approximately 20%) of postsynaptic LA neurons
(Figure 3I). The activation of presynaptic inputs followed by
backpropagating action potentials in postsynaptic neurons
with a short time interval induces associative Hebbian plasticity
in the ACx/MGN-LA pathways (Humeau et al., 2005; Shin et al.,
2006). Thus, LTP may be induced preferentially in synapses con-
sisting of presynaptic ACx/MGN inputs and postsynaptic LA
neurons that are activated during the CS/US pairings. To test
this possibility, we injected AAV-pEF1a-DIO-ChR2-eYFP into
ACx and MGN in Fos-CreERT2 3 ROSA-LSL-tdTomato mice
(Figure 6A). We employed dual behavioral labeling, in which
CS+-responding presynaptic ACx/MGN neurons were labeled
with ChR2 and postsynaptic LA neurons activated during fear
conditioning were labeled with tdTomato (Figures 6A and 6B).
After behavioral labeling, mice were trained for discriminative
fear responses selectively to the CS+ (12 kHz tone; Figure 6C).
In brain slices, LA neurons activated during fear conditioning
were identified with tdTomato expression (Figure 6D). We
induced EPSCs with photostimulation of CS+-responding
ACx/MGN axons and compared EPSCs recorded in tdTomato-
labeled and unlabeled LA neurons. The AMPA/NMDA EPSC ratio
was significantly higher in tdTomato-labeled neurons than in un-
labeled neurons (p < 0.01, unpaired t test; Figures 6E and 6F),
suggesting that CS+ pathway-specific LTP was preferentially
induced in a subset of postsynaptic LA neurons activated during
fear conditioning. Moreover, we observed more pronounced in-
ward rectification of AMPAR EPSC in tdTomato+ neurons than in
unlabeled LA neurons (p < 0.01, unpaired t test; Figures 6G and
6H), suggesting that postsynaptic increase in GluA2-lacking
AMPAR contributes to LTP induced preferentially in the fear
engram pathways (Clem and Huganir, 2010; Plant et al., 2006;
Rumpel et al., 2005). We also found that prior discriminative
fear learning occluded additional LTP induced in brain slices in
the CS+ pathways to tdTomato+ neurons (Figures S7A–S7F).
Together, these results suggest that discriminative fear learning
preferentially induced LTP in the CS+ pathways to LA neurons
that are activated during fear conditioning.
We next examined whether discriminative fear learning was
associated with enhanced synaptic efficacy in the randomly
selected ACx/MGN-LA pathways to LA neurons activated during
fear
conditioning.
To
this
end,
we
injected
AAV-pCaM-
KIIa-ChR2-eYFP into ACx and MGN in the Fos-CreERT2 3
ROSA-LSL-tdTomato mice for global ChR2 expression in the
auditory areas and labeled LA neurons activated during fear
conditioning with tdTomato (Figures 6I and 6J). After discrimina-
tive fear conditioning (Figure 6K), we induced EPSCs with photo-
stimulation of randomly selected ACx/MGN inputs and recorded
AMPAR and NMDAR EPSCs in LA neurons. There was no signif-
icant difference in the AMPA/NMDA ratio between labeled and
unlabeled LA neurons (p = 0.80, unpaired t test; Figures 6L and
6M), suggesting that synaptic efficacy in randomly selected
ACx/MGN inputs was not preferentially altered in LA neurons
activated during fear conditioning. We also compared sEPSCs
and found no significant difference in the amplitude or frequency
of sEPSCs between tdTomato-labeled and unlabeled LA
neurons (p = 0.73 and p = 0.21 for sEPSC amplitude and fre-
quency, respectively, unpaired t test; Figures S7G–S7I). Taken
together, our results suggest that discriminative fear learning is
associated with LTP, which is preferentially induced in presynap-
tic ACx/MGN inputs conveying CS+ information to a subset of
postsynaptic LA neurons activated during fear conditioning.

 Synapses in the CS+ Pathways to the LA Remained
Potentiated after Extinction of Discriminative Fear
Memory for the CS+
Conditioned fear memory can be extinguished by repeated CS
presentations without the US. A previous report suggests the
presence of fear extinction-associated synaptic changes in the
auditory pathways to the LA (Kim et al., 2007). Because the for-
mation of discriminative fear memory involves LTP selectively
induced in the neural pathways conveying CS+ information to
the LA, we examined how the extinction of discriminative fear
memory affected synaptic efficacy in the CS+-specific pathways
to the LA. We induced ChR2 expression in ACx/MGN neurons re-
sponding to the CS+ by injecting AAV-pEF1a-DIO-ChR2-eYFP
into ACx and MGN in Fos-CreERT2 mice and exposing them to
the auditory CS+ (12 kHz tone) (Figures 7A and 7B). Mice in
the FC group received discriminative fear conditioning with the
CS+ paired with the US and displayed discriminative fear to
the CS+ (Figures 7A and 7D). In the fear extinction group (EX),
we induced extinction of the discriminative fear with repeated
CS+ presentations after discriminative fear conditioning (Figures
7A and 7C). Fear extinction training for 2 days significantly
reduced fear response to the CS+ (p < 0.01, day 5 versus day
8, paired t test; Figure 7D). Mice in the NS control group received
CS+ and CS– without the US and showed no fear to either the
CS+ or CS– (Figures 7A and 7D). In brain slices, we compared
between groups EPSCs that were evoked by photostimulation
of axons of CS+-responding ACx/MGN neurons and recorded
in LA neurons. In CS+ pathways to the LA, the AMPA/NMDA
EPSC ratio was significantly different between behavioral groups
(p < 0.01, one-way ANOVA; Figures 7E and 7F). Post hoc anal-
ysis revealed that the AMPA/NMDA ratio was significantly higher
in the FC and EX groups than in the NS group (p < 0.01, FC
versus NS; p < 0.05, EX versus NS; Figure 7F), whereas there
was no significant difference between the FC and EX groups
(p = 1.00), suggesting that synaptic efficacy remains enhanced
in the auditory CS+ pathways to the LA after the extinction of
discriminative fear memory for the CS+. When ChR2 was glob-
ally expressed in ACx and MGN (Figures 7G and 7H), the
AMPA/NMDA ratio in the EX group was not significantly different
from that in the FC group (p = 0.40, unpaired t test; Figures 7I and
7J), suggesting that synaptic efficacy in nonspecific ACx/MGN-
LA pathways was not altered after fear extinction.
Optogenetically Induced Depotentiation of the CS-
Specific ACx/MGN-LA Pathways Prevented the Recall of
Fear Memory for the CS
Our results demonstrate that postsynaptically expressed LTP is
induced selectively in the ACx/MGN pathways conveying CS+
information to the LA in discriminative fear learning. We next
determined whether input-specific LTP is necessary for the
conditioned fear response by examining how input-specific
depotentiation (the reversal of LTP) in the CS-specific ACx/
MGN-LA pathways affected fear responses to the CS. To this
end, we induced ChR2 expression in ACx/MGN neurons re-
sponding to 4 or 12 kHz tone. In brain slices, we then selectively
photostimulated tone-specific ACx/MGN-LA pathways and re-
corded EPSCs in LA neurons (Figure 8A). After the baseline
recording of EPSC, we applied 1 Hz photostimulations for
5 min with a holding potential of –60 mV, which induced a
long-lasting reduction of the EPSC in the tone-specific ACx/
MGN-LA pathways (53.1% ± 8.4% of baseline, p < 0.01, paired
t test; Figures 8B and 8C).
We next applied low-frequency photostimulations in vivo to
induce depotentiation in the CS-specific ACx/MGN-LA path-
ways, which had been potentiated after fear conditioning (Fig-
ure 8D). We injected AAV-pEF1a-DIO-ChR2-eYFP (ChR2-eYFP
group) or AAV-pEF1a-DIO-eYFP (eYFP group) into ACx and
MGN in Fos-CreERT2 mice (Figure 8E). An optical cannula
was implanted dorsal to the ipsilateral LA (Figures 8E, 8F,
S8A, and S8B), and NMDA was injected into the contralateral
amygdala for an excitotoxic lesion (Figure S8C). After surgery,
mice received behavioral labeling with the auditory CS+
(12 kHz tone) for ChR2-eYFP or eYFP expression in ACx/
MGN neurons responding to the CS+. Mice were habituated
to optical cable connection on days 1–4 and fear conditioned
with CS+/US pairings on days 5 and 6 (Figures 8G and S8D),
which resulted in freezing behavior to the CS+ on day 7 in
both groups (Figure 8H). Mice then received 1 Hz photostimu-
lations for 15 min on days 7–9 (Figures 8G and S8D). After
in vivo photostimulations for 3 days, mice in the ChR2-eYFP
group displayed significantly reduced freezing behavior to the
CS+ (p < 0.01, day 7 versus day 10; Figures 8H and S8E),
whereas the same photostimulations did not significantly affect
fear response to the CS+ in the eYFP control group (p = 0.53,
Figures 8H and S8E) (groups 3 photostimulation interaction,
p < 0.05; repeated-measures two-way ANOVA with post hoc
multiple comparisons). These results indicate that reduced
fear responses after photostimulation depended on ChR2
expression in CS+-responding ACx/MGN neurons. Moreover,
the AMPA/NMDA ratio of EPSCs in the CS+-specific ACx/
MGN-LA pathways was significantly reduced in brain slices
from mice that received 1 Hz photostimulation after fear condi-
tioning, compared with that of mice that did not receive 1 Hz
photostimulation after fear conditioning (p < 0.05, unpaired t
test; Figures 8K and 8L), indicating that in vivo photostimulation
induced depotentiation in the CS-specific ACx/MGN-LA path-
ways. However, the same 1 Hz photostimulations did not
affect the AMPA/NMDA ratio in the CS-specific ACx/MGN-
ASt pathways (p = 0.15, unpaired t test; Figures S8G and
S8H). Taken together, our results suggest that depotentiation
in the CS+-specific ACx/MGN-LA pathways was sufficient to
prevent fear responses to the CS+. Therefore, LTP in the audi-
tory CS+-specific pathways to the LA is necessary for condi-
tioned fear response to the CS+.

 We also examined how in vivo photostimulations applied to
the CS– pathways to the LA affected conditioned fear responses
to the CS+. After surgery (Figures 8E and 8F), we used our
behavioral labeling protocol for the expression of ChR2 or
eYFP in ACx/MGN neurons responding to the CS– (Figure 8G).
Mice were fear conditioned to the CS+ and then received in vivo
photostimulations at 1 Hz for 3 days as in previous experiments.
Freezing behavior to the CS+ after in vivo photostimulations (day
10) was not significantly different from freezing behavior before
photostimulations (day 7) in either the ChR2 or eYFP group (Fig-
ures 8I, 8J, and S8F) (main effect of group, p = 0.23; main effect
of photostimulation, p = 0.06; groups 3 photostimulation inter-
action, p = 0.66; repeated-measures two-way ANOVA). These
results indicate that low-frequency photostimulation of the CS–
pathways to the LA did not affect conditioned fear response to
the CS+. Therefore, observed behavioral effects of photostimu-
lation in the CS+ pathways in our previous experiments are not
attributable to the effect of photostimulation in nonspecific input
pathways.
DISCUSSION
Our results demonstrate that LTP in the CS-specific ACx/MGN-
LA pathways could contribute to encoding discriminative fear
memory for the CS. Our neural activity-dependent behavioral la-
beling approach enabled the recording of synaptic responses in
the CS-specific pathways and revealed a population of LA neu-
rons that preferentially receives presynaptic inputs conveying
specific auditory information. With this approach, we found
that postsynaptically expressed LTP was induced selectively in
the pathways conveying auditory CS+ information to the LA,
whereas LTP was not detected in either the CS– pathways or
randomly selected ACx/MGN-LA synapses in discriminative
fear conditioning. Input-specific LTP was induced preferentially
in a subset of LA neurons activated during auditory fear condi-
tioning. CS-specific ACx/MGN-LA synapses remained potenti-
ated after fear extinction. Moreover, depotentiation of the CS-
specific ACx/MGN-LA pathways prevented the recall of fear
memory for the CS, suggesting that input-specific LTP is neces-
sary for conditioned fear responses to a specific auditory cue.
One of the most commonly used approaches to discover the
synaptic correlates of an associative memory is to examine
learning-induced changes in synaptic strength in relevant cir-
cuits with electrophysiological recordings in brain slices from
trained animals. In conventional recordings, synaptic responses
are induced by electrical stimulations of presynaptic inputs and
recorded in postsynaptic neurons (McKernan and Shinnick-Gal-
lagher, 1997). Recent advances in optogenetics enable more
selective activations of presynaptic inputs and more accurate re-
cordings of synaptic responses at the neural circuit level (Cho
et al., 2013; Li et al., 2013). Even with these approaches, how-
ever, it was still challenging to examine synaptic function in
functionally defined presynaptic inputs and detect input-specific
LTP efficiently with sufficient statistical power. This challenge
was overcome in our study with a novel combined approach
of behavioral labeling, optogenetic stimulation, and electro-
physiological recordings. Neural activity-dependent expression
of ChR2 by behavioral labeling enabled selective optogenetic
stimulation of the CS-specific pathways in brain slices and the
analysis of input-specific synaptic changes in discriminative
fear learning, which were previously unattainable through con-
ventional approaches. With our novel approach, we identified a
population of LA neurons that receives presynaptic inputs from
ACx/MGN neurons responding to a specific auditory stimulus.
Our study suggests that heterogeneous populations of LA neu-
rons receive ACx/MGN inputs conveying different auditory CS
information while the total number of ACx/MGN inputs to each
LA neuron is uniform.

 LTP in the ACx/MGN-LA pathways plays an essential role in
the formation of associative fear memory. As the specific audi-
tory CS activates only a subset of ACx/MGN neurons projecting
to the amygdala, LTP is thought to be induced selectively in neu-
ral pathways conveying the CS signals to the amygdala for en-
coding associative fear memory, and the input-specific LTP
could confer fear memory specificity, enabling adaptive fear re-
sponses only to the relevant sensory cue or context. However, it
was unknown whether LTP is induced globally or selectively in
the CS-specific pathways to the LA in associative fear learning.
In previous studies with in vivo recording, discriminative fear
conditioning was associated with a more robust potentiation of
single-unit activity and local field potential in the LA to the CS+
than to the CS–, suggesting that the responsiveness of the LA
was increased selectively to the CS+ (Collins and Pare
´ , 2000;
Ghosh and Chattarji, 2015; Goosens et al., 2003). However, prior
studies with electrophysiological recordings in brain slices sug-
gest that LTP may be induced globally in the ACx/MGN-LA path-
ways in auditory fear conditioning. Although synaptic responses
in the LA were evoked by electrical stimulations of randomly
selected ACx/MGN inputs in these studies, auditory fear condi-
tioning was associated with the robust potentiation of synaptic
efficacy in the ACx/MGN-LA pathways (Clem and Huganir,
2010; Kim et al., 2007; McKernan and Shinnick-Gallagher,
1997; Rumpel et al., 2005) and an occlusion of LTP in brain slices
(Cho et al., 2011; Tsvetkov et al., 2002). In our current study, we
directly examined how synaptic efficacy in the CS+ and CS–
pathways to the LA changed after discriminative fear condition-
ing. Our results suggest that synaptic potentiation with postsyn-
aptic expression mechanisms was induced selectively in the
auditory CS+ pathways to the LA, but not the CS– pathways,
in discriminative fear conditioning. Notably, LTP with either pre-
synaptic or postsynaptic expression mechanisms was not de-
tected in randomly selected ACx/MGN-LA pathways, indicating
that LTP was not induced globally in the ACx/MGN-LA pathways
in discriminative fear learning. Our results diverge from previous
reports, in which robust LTP was detected in randomly selected
ACx/MGN-LA pathways. Differences in fear conditioning proto-
cols may account for the discrepancy. We employed multiple-
trial fear conditioning for discriminative fear conditioning,
whereas previous studies used single-trial fear conditioning, in
which fear memory could have been non-discriminative, and
LTP may have been induced globally in non-discriminative fear
learning.
We also identified a subset of LA neurons in which input-
specific LTP was preferentially induced in discriminative fear
learning. The activation of presynaptic inputs followed by back-
propagating action potentials in postsynaptic neurons with a
short time interval induces associative Hebbian plasticity in the
ACx/MGN-LA pathways (Humeau et al., 2005; Shin et al.,
2006). In auditory fear conditioning, the CS-US pairings activate
only a subset of ACx/MGN and LA neurons. Thus, LTP may be
induced preferentially in synapses consisting of presynaptic
ACx/MGN and postsynaptic LA neurons that are activated dur-
ing the CS-US pairings. To test this possibility, we labeled post-
synaptic LA neurons that are activated during fear conditioning
and recorded in these neurons synaptic responses evoked by
selective stimulation of the CS+-specific ACx/MGN inputs. After
discriminative fear conditioning, both the AMPA/NMDA EPSC
ratio and rectification index of AMPAR EPSC were higher in
labeled LA neurons than in randomly selected unlabeled LA
neurons, suggesting that input-specific LTP was preferentially
induced in a subset of the ACx/MGN-LA synapses that are acti-
vated during fear conditioning. Previous studies have utilized ap-
proaches to capture and permanently tag neuronal ensembles in
the amygdala that are active during fear memory encoding (Re-
ijmers et al., 2007; Tayler et al., 2013) (for review, see Josselyn
et al., 2015). Our results are consistent with previous reports
that a subset of LA neurons are recruited preferentially into a
fear memory trace (Han et al., 2007) and undergo LTP associated
with fear conditioning (Gouty-Colomer et al., 2016; Nonaka et al.,
2014). These LA neurons may receive more robust presynaptic
inputs conveying the CS and/or US information or have higher
neuronal excitability, which facilitates LTP induction during the
CS-US pairings (Gouty-Colomer et al., 2016; Yiu et al., 2014).
We also found that CS-specific ACx/MGN-LA synapses re-
mained potentiated even after the extinction of discriminative
fear memory. There has been controversy in previous studies
regarding the synaptic mechanisms of fear extinction. Some
studies suggest that fear extinction is associated with the depot-
entiation of the MGN-LA pathway (Kim et al., 2007). In other
studies, the MGN-LA pathway remained potentiated after fear
extinction (Clem and Huganir, 2010), and optogenetically
induced LTP in the ACx/MGN-LA pathways did not reverse
fear extinction (Nabavi et al., 2014), suggesting that fear extinc-
tion learning does not involve depotentiation in the ACx/MGN-LA
pathways. Unlike previous studies in which synaptic responses
were analyzed in randomly selected ACx/MGN-LA synapses,
we examined the CS-specific ACx/MGN-LA pathways in fear
extinction because discriminative fear learning involves LTP
selectively induced in the CS-specific pathways to the LA. We
found that these pathways remained potentiated after fear
extinction, which supports the theoretical models of extinction
that posit inhibitory regulation of extant plasticity rather than
the erasure of LTP. Fear extinction is new learning leading to
the formation of extinction memory, which suppresses the
expression of conditioned fear (Herry et al., 2010; Maren,
2011). If fear extinction induces depotentiation of the ACx/
MGN-LA pathways, in which fear memory is encoded, it should
irreversibly erase the fear memory. After fear extinction, how-
ever, conditioned fear can recover spontaneously with the
mere passage of time or recur after contextual changes or the
exposure to a stressful event, suggesting the original fear mem-
ory is not erased after fear extinction (Herry et al., 2010; Maren,
2011). Thus, depotentiation does not fully account for the recur-
rence of fear memory after fear extinction. Our results suggest
that fear extinction learning does not require depotentiation of
the ACx/MGN-LA pathways but may involve synaptic plasticity
in other neural circuits, including the mPFC-amygdala pathways
(Bukalo et al., 2015; Cho et al., 2013; Do-Monte et al., 2015).
Our study implicates the input-specific LTP in encoding fear
memory for the specific auditory cue. A previous study demon-
strated that optogenetically induced LTD in the ACx/MGN-LA
pathways prevented conditioned fear responses to the auditory
cue (Nabavi et al., 2014), suggesting that LTP in these pathways
is necessary for auditory fear conditioning. As their optogenetic
1144
Neuron 95, 1129–1146, August 30, 2017
 stimulations globally induced LTD in nonselective ACx/MGN-LA
pathways, it remained to be determined whether the formation of
specific fear memory requires global or input-specific LTP. With
our behavioral labeling and in vivo optogenetic approaches, we
could selectively stimulate the CS+ or CS– ACx/MGN-LA path-
ways and modulate synaptic efficacy in vivo in an input-specific
manner. Low-frequency stimulations of the CS+, but not CS–,
pathways to the LA prevented conditioned fear responses to
the CS+. As our behavioral labeling induced transgene expres-
sion in only 10%–15% of ACx/MGN neurons projecting to
the LA, our results suggest that depotentiation of a small but
CS+-specific population of the ACx/MGN-LA pathways was
sufficient to prevent fear responses to the CS+, indicating that
the formation of discriminative fear memory requires input-
specific LTP in the ACx/MGN-LA pathways. Our findings also
provide important insights for the development of a novel
approach to attenuate pathological fear in post-traumatic stress
disorder and specific phobias because depotentiation that re-
verses the input-specific LTP could suppress maladaptive fear
without affecting adaptive fear memories, enhancing therapeutic
tolerance.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
We obtained heterozygous Fos-CreERT2 mice used in this study by crossing wild-type C57BL/6J x Fos-CreERT2 (+/�) mice.
Fos-CreERT2 (+/�) and Fos-shGFP (+/�) mice were crossed to generate Fos-CreERT2 (+/�) x Fos-shGFP (+/�) mice. Fos-CreERT2
(+/�) and Ai9 ROSA-LSL-tdTomato (+/+) mice were crossed to generate Fos-CreERT2 (+/�) x ROSA-LSL-tdTomato (+/�) mice. Mice
were singly housed in home cages on a 12-h light/dark cycle with food and water continuously available. The light cycle was from
8 AM to 8 PM. Five- to seven-week-old mice of either sex underwent stereotaxic brain surgery. All of the animal procedures were
approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of California, Riverside.
METHOD DETAILS
Virus Constructs
The recombinant adeno-associated viruses (AAVs, serotype 5) were packaged by the Vector Core at the University of North Carolina.
The AAV titer was 5.6 3 1012 genome copies (GC)/mL for AAV-pEF1a-DIO-eYFP, 4.8 3 1012 GC/mL for AAV-pEF1a-DIO-mCherry,
4.4-6.6 3 1012 GC/mL for AAV-pEF1a-DIO-ChR2(H143R)-eYFP, 8.5 3 1012 GC/mL for AAV-pCaMKIIa-ChR2(H143R)-eYFP,
4.4 3 1012 GC/mL for AAV-pEF1a-DIO-eArch3-eYFP, and 5.7 3 1012 GC/mL for AAV-pSyn-FLEX-ChrimsonR-tdTomato. Herpes
simplex viruses (HSV-pEF1a-mCherry) for the retrograde tracing experiments were packaged by Dr. Rachael Neve at the Viral
Gene Transfer Core Facility of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the titer was > 3.5 3 109 infectious units/mL.
Surgery
Virus injection surgery
Five- to seven-week-old mice were used for stereotaxic surgery. Prior to surgery, general anesthesia was induced by placing the
mice in a transparent anesthetic chamber filled with 5% isoflurane with intramuscular injection of ketamine and xylazine
(30 mg/kg and 2 mg/kg body weight, respectively). The anesthesia was maintained during surgery with 1% isoflurane applied to
the nostrils of the mice using a precision vaporizer. Mice were checked for the absence of the tail-pinch reflex as a sign of sufficient
anesthesia. The mice were then immobilized in a stereotaxic frame with non-rupture ear bars (David Kopf Instruments), and
ophthalmic ointment was applied to prevent eye drying. After making an incision to the midline of the scalp, small unilateral or bilateral
craniotomies were performed using a microdrill with 0.5-mm burrs. The tips of glass capillaries loaded with AAV were placed into the
ACx (2.8 mm caudal to bregma, 4.5 mm lateral to the midline, and 2.5 mm ventral to bregma) and MGN (3.3 mm caudal to
bregma, 2.0 mm lateral to the midline, and 3.2 mm ventral to bregma). AAV-containing solution was injected at a rate of 0.1 mL/minute
using a 10 mL Hamilton microsyringe and a syringe pump. The total volume of injected virus-containing solution was 0.15 mL for
AAV-pCaMKIIa-ChR2(H143R)-eYFP, 0.5 mL for AAV-pEF1a-DIO-ChR2(H143R)-eYFP, 0.5 mL for AAV-pEF1a-DIO-eYFP, 0.85 mL
for AAV-pEF1a-DIO-eArch3-eYFP, and 1.0 mL for AAV-pEF1a-DIO-mCherry and AAV-pSyn-FLEX-ChrimsonR-tdTomato. After injec-
tion, the capillary was left in place for an additional 5 min to allow for diffusion of the virus solution and then withdrawn. For retrograde
tracing in Figures 1F–1H, we injected HSV-pEF1a-mCherry (1.0 mL) to the LA (1.6 mm caudal to bregma, 3.5 mm lateral to the midline,
and 4.8 mm ventral to bregma). The scalp incision was closed with surgical suture, and mice were given buprenorphine-containing
saline (1 mL, 0.13 mg buprenorphine/kg body weight, subcutaneous injection) for postoperative analgesia and hydration.
Optical cannula implantation and NMDA-induced excitotoxic lesion
For the optogenetically induced depotentiation in Figures 8D–8L, an optical cannula (200 mm in diameter, numeric aperture of 0.53,
Doric Lenses) was implanted above the dorsal tip of the left LA (1.7 mm caudal to bregma, 3.7 mm lateral to the midline, and 2.5 mm
ventral from the pial surface) and secured with dental cement. To induce an excitotoxic lesion of the right amygdala, N-methyl-D-
aspartate (NMDA, 0.15 mL, 20 mg/mL) was injected into the right amygdala (1.6 mm caudal to bregma, 3.5 mm lateral to the midline,
and 4.8 mm ventral to bregma). We verified the cannula implantation site and NMDA-induced excitotoxic lesion of the amygdala in
each animal (Figures S8A–S8C).
Behavioral Labeling
One week after surgery, mice received an intraperitoneal injection of tamoxifen (150-200 mg/kg of body weight, Sigma-Aldrich).
Tamoxifen was dissolved in corn oil (Sigma-Aldrich) at 20 mg/mL with nutation for 6 hr in the dark at room temperature (22-24�C).
To minimize neuronal labeling by background noise, mice were kept in their home cage in a quiet place with minimal traffic within
a satellite animal care facility for 36 hr after tamoxifen injection. Twenty-four hours after tamoxifen injection, the mice were
placed in context C (acrylic floor and wall, white light illumination, and no olfactory cue) within a standard fear conditioning
chamber (Med Associates) and exposed to pure tone (4 kHz or 12 kHz, 70-75 dB, 5 s duration with 15 s intervals) for 30 min
e2
Neuron 95, 1129–1146.e1–e5, August 30, 2017
 (Figures 1B and S1A). To reduce context-dependent latent inhibition, mice were kept in context C during behavioral labeling, which is
different from the contexts for fear conditioning (context A) and freeze test (context B).
Auditory Discriminative Fear Conditioning
After behavioral labeling, mice were randomly assigned to either the fear conditioning (FC) group or no shock (NS) control group.
On the training day (Day 1), mice in the FC group received 6 pairings of the auditory CS+ (70-75 dB pure tone, 20 s duration) and
US (electric footshock, 0.5 mA, 2 s duration overlapping with the last 2 s of CS+) with a time interval of 120 s in context A (stainless
steel grid floor, white light illumination, and benzaldehyde odor) between 9 AM and 11 AM (Figures 3A and S3A). On Days 2-5, mice
were tested for freezing behavior in response to the CS+ and CS� once per day between 9 AM and 11 AM in context B (acrylic plate
floor, no illumination, and acetic acid odor) (Figures 3A and S3B). 4 kHz and 12 kHz pure tones were used as the auditory CS+ and
CS� (counterbalanced). For testing, mice received two presentations of both CS+ and CS�, and freezing scores were averaged for
the CS+ and CS� for each day. Between 6 PM and 8 PM on the same days (Days 2-5), mice received a single pairing of the CS+ and
US in context A and then received only CS� without the US in the same context one hour later (Figures 3A and S3C). On Day 6, mice
were tested for freezing behavior in response to the CS+ and CS� in context B, and brain slices were prepared from these mice for
electrophysiological recording experiments. Mice in the NS control group received the same CS+ and CS� on Days 1-6 as in the
FC group but never received the US. Conditioned fear responses to the CS+ and CS� were quantified as % of time immobile to
total time of CS+ or CS� presentation. Fear discrimination index (DI) was calculated using the equation, DI = (CS+ freezing �
CS� freezing) / (CS+ freezing + CS� freezing) (Figure 3C). The movement of the mice in the fear conditioning chamber was recorded
using a near-infrared camera and analyzed in real-time with Ethovision XT 11 software (Noldus). The freezing score was calculated as
the percentage of time for which the mice remained immobile. Immobility for more than 2 s during CS+ and CS� presentations was
counted as freezing behavior. Baseline immobility was also quantified as the percentage of time when the mice were immobile in the
absence of the CS+ or CS– and included in most graphs showing freezing behavior data. The temperature in the fear conditioning
chamber was 22-24�C.
For fear conditioning in Figures S5A–S5C, mice in the paired group received a pairing of the CS+ (12 kHz tone, 70-75 dB tone,
20 s duration) and US (0.5 mA electric footshock, 2 s duration overlapping with the last 2 s of CS+) in context A, whereas mice in
the unpaired group received the US 300 s after the CS+ presentation (see a diagram in Figure S3F).
For fear extinction training in Figure 7, mice received discriminative fear conditioning on Days 1-4 and then received 20 CS+
presentations with 50 s intervals in context B once per day for 2 days (Days 6-7). On Day 8, mice were tested for freezing behavior
to both CS+ and CS� in context B, and brain slices were prepared from these mice for electrophysiological recording experiments.
In vivo Optogenetic Stimulation
For in vivo optogenetic experiments (Figures 8D–8L), AAV-pEF1a-DIO-ChR2-eYFP (ChR2-eYFP group) or AAV-pEF1a-DIO-eYFP
(eYFP control group) was injected into ACx and MGN in Fos-CreERT2 mice. An optical cannula was implanted targeting the left
LA for in vivo optogenetic stimulations, and NMDA was injected into the right amygdala for excitotoxic lesion. One week after surgery,
we used our behavioral labeling protocol to induce ChR2 or eYFP expression in ACx/MGN neurons responding to the CS+ (12 kHz
tone, 70-75 dB) or CS� (4 kHz tone, 70-75 dB) in context C after tamoxifen administration (Figures 8G and S8D). Three weeks after
behavioral labeling, mice were habituated with the optical cannula connected to the optical patch cable without laser stimulation for
10 min once per day for 4 days (Days 1-4) in context C. On the training days (Days 5-6), mice were placed in context A in a fear con-
ditioning chamber without optical cannula connection and given 6 pairings of the auditory CS+ (12 kHz tone, 70-75 dB, 20 s duration)
and US (electric footshock, 0.5 mA, 2 s duration overlapping with the last 2 s of CS+) with 120 s time intervals. On the test days (Days
7-10), mice were placed in context B and tested for freezing behavior to the CS+ between 9 AM and 10 AM. After a 2- to 3 min accli-
matization period, the CS+ was presented only once per day to minimize fear extinction. Mice displaying robust freezing behavior in
response to the CS+ (> 20% freezing time) on Day 7 were included in the in vivo optogenetic experiments. On the same days (Days 7-
9), mice were placed in context C with the optical cannula connected to the optical patch cable (200 mm in diameter, numeric aperture
of 0.53, Doric lenses) for photostimulations between 7 PM and 8 PM. After a 2 min acclimatization period, mice received 1 Hz pulses
of photostimulations (1 ms duration) for 15 min with a 10 s pause every minute once per day (Figure S8D). Blue light illumination was
delivered from a blue laser (450 nm, Opto Engine) to the optical cannula through the optical patch cable and optical rotary joint, and
the light power was 22-25 mW at the cannula tip. After blue light illumination, mice were left in context C for an additional 3 min. After
the final behavioral test on Day 10, brain slices from these mice were prepared for electrophysiological recordings and histological
analysis. We verified cannula implantation sites as well as the NMDA-induced excitotoxic lesion of the amygdala in each mouse and
excluded mice from analysis when the optical cannula implantation missed the LA.
Histology and Microscopic Imaging
Acute brain slices (300 mm thick) were prepared with a vibratome (VT-1000S, Leica Biosystems) and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde-
containing phosphate buffered saline (PBS, 137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 11.9 mM phosphate, pH 7.4) at 4�C overnight. After fixation,
slices were washed twice in PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100 (PBS-T) at room temperature for 10 min and permeabilized in PBS-T
at 4�C overnight. For Nissl staining, slices were incubated with Neurotrace fluorescent Nissl stain (1:40 diluted in PBS, 615 nm emis-
sion maximum, Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 3 hr at room temperature and washed in PBS-T three times for 10 min each. After a final
Neuron 95, 1129–1146.e1–e5, August 30, 2017
e3
 wash in PBS-T, Vectashield mounting media (Vector Laboratories) was applied to the slices, which were then covered with cover-
slips. Microscopic images were captured using the Leica TCS SP5 confocal system (Leica Microsystems). Images captured with
different fluorescent channels were merged using ImageJ software (National Institute of Mental Health). For each mouse, a virus
injection site was verified with ChR2-eYFP expression in ACx and MGN. Mice in which the target area was missed were excluded
from the analysis. For fluorescent labeling of the recorded neurons (Figure 2E), neurons were loaded with the pipette solution con-
taining 5 mM biocytin for 20 min. The pipette was then withdrawn slowly, and the brain slices were fixed at 4�C overnight with 4%
paraformaldehyde. After fixation, slices were washed with PBS-T twice for 10 min each and incubated with streptavidin-Alexa 568
conjugate (20 mg/mL in PBS, Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 2 hr at room temperature. The unbound streptavidin was then washed out
with PBS three times for 20 min each, and the slices were mounted onto slides. Images of the labeled neurons were taken using a
Leica TSC SP5 confocal microscope, and neuronal morphology and location within the LA were analyzed.
Cell Counting
To quantify the proportion of behaviorally labeled ACx/MGN neurons (eYFP+) among all LA-projecting ACx/MGN neurons
(mCherry+) in Figures 1F–1H, confocal microscopic images of 3-4 representative fields (0.56 mm2) were taken for each mouse
with a 20X objective lens using the Leica TCS SP5 confocal system within the ACx and MGN, where mCherry+ neurons were distrib-
uted most densely in these areas. The confocal images were then Z stacked using ImageJ software. LA-projecting neurons
(mCherry+) and behaviorally labeled neurons (eYFP+) were identified based on the florescence labeling of cell bodies. The propor-
tions of behaviorally labeled ACx/MGN neurons (eYFP+) among all LA-projecting ACx/MGN neurons (mCherry+) were calculated in
each field of the ACx/MGN and averaged for each mouse.
To examine the specificity of behavioral labeling in Figures 1I–1K and S1D–S1F, we labeled ACx and MGN neurons at two different
time points so that mCherry+ neurons reflected neurons labeled in the remote past, whereas shGFP+ neurons reflected neurons
labeled more recently. We captured confocal microscopic images of 3-4 representative fields (0.56 mm2) with a 20X objective
lens in the ACx and MGN, where shGFP-labeled neurons were most abundant within the ACx and MGN. The proportion of shGFP+
neurons among all mCherry+ neurons within the field of view was calculated and averaged for each mouse.
Whole-Cell Patch-Clamp Recording in Brain Slices
For electrophysiological recordings in brain slices, the mice were deeply anesthetized with 5% isoflurane and decapitated. Brains
were dissected quickly and chilled in ice-cold artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) containing 130 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 2.5 mM
CaCl2, 1 mM MgSO4, 1.25 mM NaH2PO4, 26 mM NaHCO3, and 10 mM glucose with 95% O2 and 5% CO2. Coronal brain slices
containing the amygdala (300-mm thick) were prepared with a vibratome. After a 1 hr recovery period, slices were placed in the
recording chamber and continuously perfused with the ACSF at the rate of 1 mL per minute. The patch electrodes (2-3 MU resis-
tance) were filled with pipette solution containing 140 mM Cs-methanesulfonate, 5 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 10 mM HEPES, 0.2
EGTA, 2 mM MgATP, 0.5 mM NaGTP, and 5 mM QX 314 chloride (290 mOsm, adjusted to pH 7.3 with CsOH). For experiments in
Figures 6G and 6H, we added 0.5 mM spermine to the pipette solution. For experiments in Figures S7D–S7F, we replaced
140 mM Cs-methanesulfonate with 150 mM K-gluconate without QX 314 added. We recorded EPSCs in putative principal
neurons in the LA with a membrane capacitance larger than 70 pF (see Figures S4A–S4D). For the morphological analysis of re-
corded neurons in Figure 2E, we added biocytin (5 mM) to the pipette solution. Whole-cell patch clamp recordings were per-
formed at 30-32�C using a Multiclamp 700B amplifier, a Digidata 1550A or 1320A digitizer and Clampex 10 software (Molecular
Devices). The membrane potential was held constant at –80 mV in voltage-clamp mode unless otherwise indicated. The liquid
junction potential of 8.9 mV was corrected. Series (access) resistance was not compensated. Offline data analysis was per-
formed using the Clampfit 10 program (Molecular Devices). Reagents were prepared as stock solutions in water at 1000-fold con-
centrations and stored at –20�C.
Photostimulation in brain slices
A blue collimated light-emitting diode (LED) with a peak wavelength of 470 nm (M470L3, Thorlabs) was used for photostimulation of
ChR2-expressing axons. The LED was connected to the amplifier and digitizer through the LED driver (LEDD1B, Thorlabs). Brain
slices in the recording chamber were illuminated through a 40X water-immersion objective lens (Olympus LUMPLFLN 40XW or Leica
HCX APO L40x #506155) and a 450-490 nm filter (Chroma). The illumination area was 0.17 mm2 and was centered at the soma of the
neuron patched for recording. Intensity and duration of photostimulation were controlled using a Digidata 1550A or 1320A digitizer
and pClamp 10 software (Molecular Devices). Light power in miliwatts (mW) was measured at 470 nm using a power meter (PM100A,
Thorlabs) placed under the objective lens, and light power density (mW/mm2) was calculated by dividing light power by illumination
area. To evoke synaptic responses in the LA by photostimulation of ACx/MGN axons, slices were illuminated every 20 s with blue
light pulses of 1 ms duration (light power density: 2.8-20 mW/mm2 at 470 nm). When apparent polysynaptic activities were detected
in EPSC recordings, we reduced photostimulation intensity to prevent the contribution from polysynaptic components to our
measurement of AMPAR and NMDAR EPSC amplitudes. When we could not eliminate polysynaptic activities by adjusting the
stimulation intensity, we terminated the experiments for the recorded neurons. For the activation of Chrimson-expressing axons (Fig-
ures S2H–S2K), an LED with a peak wavelength of 617 nm (M617L3, Thorlabs) was used (55 mW/mm2 at 617 nm). For the
e4
Neuron 95, 1129–1146.e1–e5, August 30, 2017
 optogenetic silencing of eArch3-expressing ACx/MGN axons (Figures 5A–5F and S6A–S6G), an LED with a peak wavelength of
590 nm (M590L3, Thorlabs) was used for continuous orange light illumination (12.0 mW/mm2 at 590 nm), and was turned on
20 ms before and turned off 9 ms after blue light pulses.
AMPA/NMDA EPSC ratio
AMPAR EPSCs were recorded at �80 mV, and NMDAR EPSCs were recorded at +40 mV in voltage-clamp mode. SR-95531 (10 mM),
a GABA-A receptor antagonist, was added to the ACSF to prevent the contamination of inhibitory postsynaptic currents in the feed-
forward inhibitory circuit. Photostimulation intensity was adjusted such that the peak amplitude of AMPAR EPSC was 50-250 pA. For
each LA neuron, the same photostimulation intensity and duration were used to record AMPAR and NMDAR EPSCs. To calculate the
AMPA/NMDA EPSC ratio, we recorded the first set of AMPAR EPSCs (3-5 traces) at �80 mV and then recorded NMDAR EPSCs (3-5
traces) at +40 mV. Then, the holding potential was returned to �80 mV to record the second set of AMPAR EPSCs (3-5 traces). We
also recorded EPSCs at 0 mV. This recording protocol minimized the effect of time-dependent EPSC changes on the AMPA/NMDA
ratio. To quantify AMPAR EPSCs, we averaged AMPAR EPSC traces recorded before and after recording NMDAR EPSCs and calcu-
lated the peak amplitude of averaged AMPAR EPSCs. To quantify NMDAR EPSCs, we averaged NMDAR EPSC traces and measured
the mean amplitudes of the averaged NMDAR EPSCs between 47.5 ms and 52.5 ms after the onset of photostimulations. Then, we
calculated the amplitude ratio of AMPAR EPSCs to NMDAR EPSCs. For each mouse, we typically obtained 2-3 brain slices (300 mm
thick) with well-defined LA and recorded AMPAR and NMDAR EPSCs in 2-3 LA neurons per slice.
Progressive block of NMDAR EPSC by MK-801
To compare presynaptic release probability in the ACx/MGN inputs to the LA between behavioral groups, we recorded NMDAR
EPSCs at +40 mV in voltage-clamp mode in the presence of NBQX (10 mM) and SR-95531 (10 mM). Photostimulation intensity was
adjusted so that the peak amplitude of NMDAR EPSC was 200-500 pA. After baseline recording, the brain slice was perfused with
the ACSF containing MK-801 (10 mM) for 10-15 min. Then, we recorded NMDAR EPSCs evoked by photostimulations applied every
10 s. To quantify the rate of NMDAR EPSC decay by MK-801, decay constant (t) in stimulus number was calculated in each LA neuron
by fitting the curve of NMDAR EPSC decrease to a single-exponential equation, I(n) = I1 exp(�n/t), where n is stimulus number, I(n) is
the peak amplitude of nth NMDAR EPSC, and I1 is the peak amplitude of the first NDMAR EPSC recorded in the presence of MK-801.
Paired-pulse ratio
To calculate the paired-pulse ratio (PPR), AMPAR EPSCs were evoked by paired photostimulations (50 ms interval, 0.5 ms duration)
of ChR2-expressing presynaptic axons and recorded in LA neurons at �80 mV in voltage-clamp mode. PPR was calculated as the
peak amplitude ratio of the first to the second EPSC. As the PPR was affected by photostimulation intensity, we induced EPSCs with
photostimulations of different light intensities and calculated the PPR for each photostimulation intensity in each LA neuron.
Rectification index of AMPAR EPSC
AMPA receptor-mediated EPSCs were induced by photostimulation of ChR2-expressing axons and recorded at –80 and +40 mV in
voltage-clamp mode in the presence of D-AP5 (50 mM) and SR-95531 (10 mM). We recorded the first set of AMPAR EPSCs at �80 mV
(3-5 traces) and then recorded AMPAR EPSCs at +40 mV (3-5 traces). Then, the holding potential was returned to �80 mV to record
the second set of AMPAR EPSCs at �80 mV (3-5 traces). We also recorded EPSCs at 0 mV. To quantify AMPAR EPSCs at –80 mV, we
averaged AMPAR EPSC traces recorded at –80 mV before and after recording AMPAR EPSCs at +40 mV and calculated the peak
amplitude of averaged AMPAR EPSCs. This recording protocol minimized the effect of time-dependent EPSC changes on the recti-
fication index (RI), which was calculated from the equation, RI = (EPSC–80 / 80) / (EPSC+40 / 40), where EPSC–80 and EPSC+40 are peak
amplitude of EPSCs recorded at –80 and +40 mV, respectively. The pipette solution contained 0.5 mM spermine, which mediates
inward rectification of GluA2-lacking AMPA receptors.
Spontaneous EPSC
Spontaneous EPSCs (sEPSC) were recorded in principal neurons in the LA at �80 mV in voltage-clamp mode for 3-5 min (Figures
S6H–S6L and S7G–S7I). The amplitude, inter-event interval and frequency of sEPSC were analyzed using the event detection func-
tion of the Clampfit software (Molecular Devices). The average amplitude and frequency of sEPSC were calculated in each LA neuron
and were compared between behavioral groups.
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Data are presented as means ± the standard error of the mean (SEM) unless indicated otherwise. For statistical comparisons, we
used Welch’s t test (two-tailed), ordinary or repeated-measures ANOVA. For post hoc analysis, we used Bonferroni’s simultaneous
multiple comparisons. Statistical analysis was performed with Minitab 17 (Minitab) and Prism 7 (GraphPad) software, and p < 0.05
was considered statistically significant. Details of statistical analyses are summarized in Tables S1 and S2. Statistical comparisons of
passive membrane properties of recorded neurons between groups are summarized in Table S3.
