SUMMARY
While much research has examined the use of glucose and glutamine by tumor cells, many cancers 
instead prefer to metabolize fats. Despite the pervasiveness of this phenotype, knowledge of 
pathways that drive fatty acid oxidation (FAO) in cancer is limited. Prolyl hydroxylase domain 
proteins hydroxylate substrate proline residues and have been linked to fuel switching. Here we 
reveal that PHD3 rapidly triggers repression of FAO in response to nutrient abundance via 
hydroxylation of acetyl-coA carboxylase 2 (ACC2). We find that PHD3 expression is strongly 
decreased in subsets of cancer including acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and is linked to a reliance

regulation of ACC2 and consequently impedes leukemia cell proliferation. Thus, loss of PHD3

Graphical Abstract
INTRODUCTION
In the past decade a resurgence of studies has provided mechanistic insight into why tumors 
upregulate glucose uptake and metabolism (Lunt and Vander Heiden, 2011). However, our 
understanding of tumor metabolism is incomplete because numerous tumors are FDG-PET 
negative (Long and Smith, 2011; Ono et al., 2007), suggesting many cancers utilize alternate 
carbon sources. Multiple cancer types have been suggested to rely on FAO for survival 
(Carracedo et al., 2013), highlighting a need to identify specific lipid metabolic programs 
that may go awry in cancer.
Post-translational modifying enzymes are key components of metabolic reprogramming 
(German and Haigis, 2015; Hitosugi and Chen, 2013). PHDs (also called EGLN1-3) are one 
class of enzymes poised to coordinate metabolism in response to changing cellular 
conditions. PHDs are a conserved family of oxygen- and α-ketoglutarate dependent 
enzymes that are well known to regulate glycolytic metabolism through hydroxylation of 
hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) (Gorres and Raines, 2010). Hypoxia and a number of 
mutations in cancer repress activity of some PHDs, stabilizing HIFα and triggering a 
transcriptional program to increase glycolysis and anabolism while limiting mitochondrial 
bioenergetics (Masson and Ratcliffe, 2014).
Recent reports suggest that PHDs are also responsive to cellular nutrient status (Kaelin and 
Ratcliffe, 2008). This may be linked to the use of α-ketoglutarate during prolyl

 hydroxylation (Durán et al., 2012). PHD3 is notable for its particular sensitivity to α-
ketoglutarate, or perhaps more generally to the high nutrient state that may be achieved by 
addition of α-ketoglutarate. Along these lines, treating mouse xenografts with cell-
permeable α-ketoglutarate inhibited growth by a PHD3-dependent mechanism (Tennant and 
Gottlieb, 2010). This raises the question of whether PHD3 is responsive to fluctuations in 
the nutrient state. We hypothesized that PHD3 might link nutrient status with 
implementation of metabolic adaptations. Therefore, we aimed to identify metabolic 
pathways regulated by PHD3.
In this study, we identify acetyl-CoA carboxylase 2 (ACC2), the gatekeeper of FAO, as a 
PHD3 substrate. By activating ACC2, PHD3 represses oxidation of long chain fatty acids. 
Fatty acid catabolism is a dynamic cellular process that responds to metabolic imbalances 
and restores homeostasis (Gerhart-Hines et al., 2007). We show that PHD3 represses FAO 
during nutrient abundance, and that cells with low PHD3 have persistent FAO regardless of 
external nutrient cues. In AML, PHD3 expression is dramatically decreased, contributing to 
a boost in fatty acid consumption that drives AML cell proliferation and disease severity.
RESULTS
PHD3 binds and modifies ACC by prolyl hydroxylation
To probe for PHD3 substrates, we performed immunoprecipitation of PHD3 followed by 
liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS2) and detected an interaction 
with acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC). 21 ACC peptides were identified in the PHD3 
immunoprecipitation, while no ACC peptides were identified in PHD2 or negative control 
samples (Table S1). IP-Western blots confirmed that ACC interacted with PHD3 but not 
PHD1, PHD2 or anti-HA affinity resin alone (Figure 1A). ACC converts acetyl-CoA to 
malonyl-CoA, which serves as a precursor for fat synthesis and an inhibitor of FAO (Abu-
Elheiga et al., 2003). Hence, ACC is a key regulator of fatty acid homeostasis that 
determines whether cells catabolize or synthesize fatty acids (Brownsey et al., 2006).
As PHD3 belongs to a family of prolyl hydroxylases, we first examined ACC hydroxylation 
by PHD3. Using immunoprecipitation of ACC followed by Western blot with a pan-
hydroxyproline antibody, we observed ACC hydroxylation. PHD3 overexpression boosted 
ACC hydroxylation (Figure 1B), while two catalytically inactive PHD3 mutants, H196A and 
R206K (Bruick, 2001; Rantanen et al., 2008), did not increase ACC hydroxylation (Figure 
1C). ACC is present in two spatially and functionally distinct isoforms. Cytosolic ACC1 
provides malonyl-CoA for fatty acid synthesis, while ACC2 localized to the outer 
mitochondrial membrane generates malonyl-CoA to inhibit the fatty acid transport protein 
CPT1, suppressing mitochondrial FAO (Brownsey et al., 2006). Several PHD3-interacting 
peptides found by mass spectrometry are shared between ACC1 and ACC2 (Table S1); we 
therefore interrogated whether PHD3 hydroxylates ACC1 or ACC2. Immunoprecipitation of 
endogenous ACC1 or ACC2 by isoform-specific antibodies demonstrated hydroxylation was 
specific to ACC2 and amplified by PHD3 (Figure 1D), indicating that PHD3 modulates 
ACC2 hydroxylation level.

 We next mapped ACC2 sites of hydroxyproline, as detected by a +15.9949 molecular weight 
shift (Figures 1E and 1F). Three candidate hydroxylated prolines had >5 redundant peptides 
per site: prolines 343, 450 and 2131 (Figure 1G). These sites are located in the biotin 
carboxylase, ATP-grasp and carboxyltransferase domains, respectively (Figure 1H). To 
validate hydroxylation of these residues, we generated proline to alanine point mutants at 
each site and found that P450A mutagenesis most dramatically decreased hydroxylation 
(Figure 1I). Using a reconstituted in vitro hydroxylation assay, recombinant PHD3 
hydroxylated a synthetic ACC2 peptide containing P450, but not a peptide containing P2131 
or a control ACC2 proline-containing peptide (P966) (Figure 1J). These data identify P450 
as a major hydroxylation site and suggest that modification of this residue may coordinate 
ACC2 function.
Hydroxylation at residue P450 promotes ACC2 activity and ATP binding
At 16 daltons, hydroxylation is among the smallest posttranslational modifications. 
Nevertheless, the electronegativity it imparts alters proline residue pucker, favors trans-
configuration of the peptide bond and can induce structural changes significant enough to 
alter protein-protein interactions or activity (Gorres and Raines, 2010; Loenarz and 
Schofield, 2011). Thus, we investigated whether site-specific hydroxylation might regulate 
ACC2 function. P450 is conserved from yeast to humans (Figure 2A) in the ATP-grasp 
domain, a 196-amino acid region within the biotin carboxylase domain that includes 
nucleotide-binding amino acids at residues 458-463 (Almarza-Ortega, 1997). We mapped 
site P450 in the human ACC2 biotin carboxylase domain crystal structure (PDB: 3JRW) 
(Cho et al., 2010) superposed with the e. coli ATP-bound ACC biotin carboxylase domain 
(PDB: 1DV2) (Thoden, 2000). Modeling revealed that P450 is in close proximity to the 
catalytic site ATP (Figure 2B). P450 caps the adenine ring of ATP, while the phosphate 
groups of ATP abut the previously described nucleotide-binding site within ACC2.
The proximity of P450 to ATP led us to hypothesize that hydroxylation modulates the ability 
of ACC2 to bind ATP. We purified ATP-binding proteins from dialyzed cell lysates using 
ATP affinity chromatography and determined levels of ACC bound. ACC2 lacking the major 
hydroxylation site upon P450 mutation to alanine or glycine showed decreased ATP binding 
versus wild type (Figures 2C and S1A), highlighting the importance of this residue for ATP 
binding. Strikingly, knockdown of PHD3 also diminished ATP binding of ACC2 (Figure 
2D), demonstrating that hydroxylation is critical for optimal ATP binding. Thus, PHD3 may 
activate ACC2 by enabling greater affinity for the co-substrate ATP.
To evaluate this hypothesis, we performed in vitro ACC activity assays from 293T cells, 
based on production of [14C]malonyl-CoA from [14C]bicarbonate and acetyl-CoA. ACC2 
overexpression resulted in higher activity, as did addition of the known allosteric modulator 
citrate (Ruderman and Prentki, 2004), validating the specificity of this assay (Figure 2E). 
The P450A mutation strongly decreased ACC activity (Figure 2E). Of note, PHD3 
overexpression increased wild type ACC2 activity (Figure 2F) but had no effect on P450A 
ACC2. Conversely, PHD3 knockdown decreased ACC2 activity (Figure 2G). These findings 
support the model that PHD3 boosts ACC2 activity via hydroxylation of P450.

 PHD3 represses FAO
ACC2 inhibits FAO by limiting long chain fatty acid import into the mitochondrial matrix 
(Ruderman and Prentki, 2004). Because ACC2 is activated by PHD3, we hypothesized that 
PHD3 represses FAO. PHD3 knockdown enhanced palmitate oxidation in 293T and HepG2 
cells (Figures 3A, S2A–D). PHD1 and PHD2 expression were not consistently altered by 
PHD3 knockdown, indicating that the effect was not due to other PHDs (Figure S2B). To 
assess the role of ACC2 prolyl hydroxylation on FAO, we measured palmitate oxidation in 
cells overexpressing P450A ACC2. While overexpression of wild type ACC2 decreased 
FAO, ACC2 lacking the proline hydroxylation site did not repress FAO (Figure 3B). In 
contrast, P343A and P2131A variants behaved similarly to wild type ACC2 (Figure S2E).
ACC2 knockdown increased FAO in 293T cells by 2.5-fold, while the effect of PHD3 
knockdown was of similar magnitude (1.5–2 fold), demonstrating that PHD3 is a major 
contributor to FAO regulation (Figure S2F compared to Figures 3A and 3C; extent of ACC2 
knockdown shown in Figure S2G). Immunoblots with control ACC2 knockdown confirmed 
that ACC2 is ~276 kDa and often appears as two bands that may correspond to different 
oligomerization states (Figures S2G and S2H), consistent with studies showing that ACC2 
exists in oligomeric complexes and that phosphorylation pushes ACC to a monomeric state 
(Cho et al., 2010). The presence of ACC2 in both bands was confirmed by IP-mass 
spectrometry (data not shown). Collectively, our findings demonstrate that PHD3 modulates 
FAO at a physiologically significant magnitude similar to the effect of other known lipid 
metabolism regulators including ACC2 itself, CPT1, adiponectin and sirtuins (Fullerton et 
al., 2013; Gerhart-Hines et al., 2007; Laurent et al., 2013; Yoon, 2006).
ACC2 gates long chain fatty acid import into the mitochondria, whereas short and medium 
chain fatty acids freely diffuse and bypass ACC2 regulation (Madden et al., 1995; 
O’Donnell et al., 2002). To validate the role of ACC2 in PHD3-mediated regulation of FAO, 
we probed whether PHD3 specifically modulates long chain FAO. Comparison of the long 
chain,16-C palmitate versus 6-C hexanoate oxidation revealed that PHD3 knockdown 
specifically boosted long chain FAO (Figure 3C). We next tested the effect of PHD3 
overexpression on fatty acid synthesis, a process mediated by ACC1. Consistent with our 
studies showing that ACC2, but not ACC1, is hydroxylated by PHD3, we observed no effect 
of PHD3 on fatty acid synthesis (Figures S2I and S2J). In sum, PHD3 regulates FAO at the 
level of ACC2.
PHD3 repression of FAO occurs independently of HIF and AMPK
Because HIF is the most well characterized target of PHD family members, we assessed 
dependence on the HIF regulatory axis. PHD3 modulated FAO regardless of the presence or 
absence of HIF. PHD3 overexpression repressed FAO, while PHD3 knockdown amplified 
FAO, in mouse hepatoma 4 (B13NBii1) HIFβ-null cells which lack HIF1 transcriptional 
activity (Wood et al., 1996) (Figure 3D–F). The absence of HIF activity was validated by 
treatment with CoCl2, which stabilizes HIFα, but did not induce HIF target genes in these 
cells (Figure 3F). Additionally, HIF1/2α protein levels were not changed by PHD3 
knockdown (Figure 3G). Furthermore, PHD3 knockdown boosted FAO in 786-O VHL-
deficient renal carcinoma cells with constitutively stabilized HIF (Iliopoulos et al., 1996)

 (Figures 3H and S2K). We also found that PHD3 knockdown amplified FAO both under 
normoxia (21% O2) and hypoxia (1% O2) (Figure 3I), consistent with reports that PHD3 is 
less sensitive to oxygen levels than PHD1 or PHD2 (Luo et al., 2011). In total, these data 
demonstrate that PHD3 represses FAO independently of HIF.
We next examined whether PHD3 activates ACC2 in concert with the major known regulator 
of this metabolic node, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) (Ruderman and Prentki, 
2004). Upon detecting a low cellular energy status, AMPK inhibits ACC2 by 
phosphorylating serine 222, disrupting the dimer-dimer interface to block formation of the 
more active ACC oligomer (Cho et al., 2010). In this way, AMPK activates FAO as part of a 
program to restore ATP levels. PHD3 knockdown amplified FAO in both wildtype and 
AMPKα-knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) (Figure 3J, S2L and S2M). PHD3 
overexpression repressed FAO in the absence of AMPKα (Figure S2N). Additionally, we 
found that AMPK phosphorylated ACC under low nutrient conditions in both control and 
PHD3-knockdown MEFs, and ACC phosphorylation decreased upon nutrient restoration 
regardless of PHD3 status (Figure S2O). Thus, our data suggest that PHD3 regulates FAO 
through a mechanism independent of AMPK.
PHD3 hydroxylates ACC and represses FAO in response to nutrient abundance
In many tissues, fatty acids are not a predominant fuel choice under nutrient replete 
conditions but rather are reserved for times of nutrient deprivation to restore metabolic 
homeostasis (Gerhart-Hines et al., 2007). During conditions of stress or low energy, cells 
ramp up ATP production by activating FAO via AMPK signaling. While AMPK boosts FAO 
by inhibiting ACC2, our data show PHD3 has the opposite effect of repressing FAO by 
activating ACC2. Because recent reports underscore a possible link between PHDs and 
cellular nutrient status (Kaelin and Ratcliffe, 2008; MacKenzie et al., 2007), we wondered 
whether PHD3 might be a candidate for dynamically repressing FAO in response to nutrient 
abundance. In control vector-treated cells, ACC was strongly hydroxylated in the presence 
of high glucose medium containing serum (high) versus cells treated 12 h with serum-free, 
low glucose medium (low) (Figure 3K, vector lanes). However, PHD3 overexpression 
restored ACC hydroxylation to nearly that observed in the high nutrient state (Figure 3K). 
This suggests that endogenous PHD3 hydroxylates and activates ACC particularly when 
nutrients are abundant. In support of this model, PHD3 knockdown abrogated ACC 
hydroxylation in high nutrient medium (Figure 3L, left). In comparison, the effect of PHD3 
knockdown was less evident in low nutrient conditions (Figure 3L, right). We next 
performed a time course analysis of ACC2 hydroxylation under high versus low nutrient 
conditions. ACC2 hydroxylation decreased following 6 h in low glucose, serum-free 
medium, and hydroxylation increased in a PHD3-dependent manner after only 10 minutes of 
restoring high nutrient medium (Figures 3M and S2P). PHD3 silencing most potently 
represses ACC2 activity in the time frame immediately after restoring high nutrients 
(Figures S2Q and S2R). Thus, our data suggest that PHD3 is an acute metabolic toggle 
responsive to cellular nutrient abundance.
We reasoned that cells with low PHD3 would lack this metabolic switch, uncoupling FAO 
repression in nutrient abundance. In multiple cell lines, palmitate oxidation was enhanced in

 serum-free, low glucose medium but blunted in the presence of high glucose and serum 
(Figures 3N and S2S). However, upon PHD3 knockdown, cells lost sensitivity to external 
nutrient cues and displayed elevated FAO even in the presence of high nutrients. Similarly, 
supplementing low nutrient medium with cell-permeable versions of the TCA cycle 
intermediate α-ketoglutarate for 6 h prior to FAO analysis repressed palmitate oxidation, 
unless PHD3 was downregulated by shRNA (Figure 3O). This indicates that PHD3 limits 
FAO in nutrient-replete conditions, and that nutrient deprivation lifts PHD3-mediated 
repression of FAO.
Our findings suggest PHD3 activates ACC2 to inhibit CPT1. In support, metabolomics 
analysis revealed that PHD3 knockdown by shRNA increased long chain acylcarnitines – 
FAO intermediates generated by CPT1 – but short and medium chain acylcarnitines, which 
bypass the ACC2/CPT1 regulatory node, were unchanged (Figure 3P). This profile is 
reminiscent of the way in which glycolytic intermediates increase upon upregulation of 
glycolysis (Finley et al., 2011), provided the initial substrate is not limiting; here, too, we 
observe that long chain FAO intermediates are increased when FAO is upregulated by PHD3 
silencing. Our data suggests that, together, AMPK and PHD3 toggle FAO in a manner that is 
sensitive to both high and low nutrient status (Figure 3Q).
Low PHD3 expression drives altered metabolism in AML
In some cancers, FAO fuels energy production, antioxidant defense via NADPH production, 
nucleotide synthesis and maintenance of the mitochondrial membrane potential to prevent 
apoptosis induction (Jeon et al., 2012; Samudio et al., 2010; Schafer et al., 2009; Schoors et 
al., 2015; Zaugg et al., 2011). PHD3 downregulation is a common feature of multiple cancer 
types (Rawluszko et al., 2013), and we hypothesized that low PHD3 levels might predict a 
dependency on FAO in cancer.
We used bioinformatics to assess the metabolic impact of low PHD3 expression in cancer. 
Analysis of the Ramaswamy, Valk and Andersson leukemia datasets from the Oncomine 
cancer gene expression database (http://www.oncomine.org) showed that PHD3 expression 
was lower in AML compared to a panel of other cancerous tissues (Figure 4A–C) 
(Andersson et al., 2007; Valk et al., 2004). AML has been previously linked to increased 
fatty acid catabolism (Carracedo et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2013); thus, we assessed the impact 
of PHD3 on this phenotype. Using gene expression data from patient samples in The Cancer 
Genome Atlas (TCGA), we clustered AML patients into two groups (PHD3-low and PHD3-
high) using a Gaussian mixture model based on the level of PHD3 expression. Nearly 80% 
of patients fell into the low PHD3 group (Figures 4D and 4E). Gene Set Enrichment 
Analysis revealed that the top curated gene sets inversely correlated with high PHD3 
expression in AML are largely markers of oxidative metabolism (Figures 4F and S3A–S3D). 
Of note, we found no significant link between PHD3 and expression of ACC2, AMPK or 
LKB1 (Figures S3E–S3G) in TCGA data. These data support a model in which high PHD3 
expression may indicate AML cells are not fueled by oxidative metabolism, while low 
PHD3 expression can enable a switch toward FAO.
In line with patient data, PHD3 gene expression was nearly undetectable in a panel of AML 
cell lines (MOLM14, KG1, THP1, NB4 and U937) compared to the K562 chronic myeloid

 leukemia (CML) cell line (Figure 4G). Low-PHD3 AML cells show reduced ACC 
hydroxylation and ATP binding (Figures 4H and 4I) and markedly increased palmitate 
oxidation (Figure 4J). PHD1 and PHD2 are not repressed to the same extent as PHD3 in 
AML cells (Figures S3H and S3I), indicating that PHD3 expression is specifically linked to 
the observed traits.
Recent studies revealed that AML frequently displays enhanced dependence on FAO 
(Samudio et al., 2010). Inhibition of FAO increases sensitivity to apoptosis in cell culture 
and in a murine model of human AML (Estañ et al., 2014; Lee et al., 2015). Furthermore, 
FAO was shown to be critical for maintenance of hematopoietic stem cells, and was 
suggested to be involved in the maintenance of leukemic initiation cells (Ito et al., 2012). We 
hypothesized that low-PHD3 leukemia cells possess a metabolic liability rooted in their 
dependency on FAO, so we examined leukemia cell sensitivity to etomoxir or ranolazine, 
FAO inhibitors that have shown success in treating angina and heart disease (Holubarsch et 
al., 2007; Nash and Nash, 2008). Etomoxir inhibits CPT1, and ranolazine inhibits 3-
ketoacylthiolase, the enzyme catalyzing the final step of β-oxidation (Carracedo et al., 
2013). Within 96 h, FAO inhibition led to substantial cell death in a panel of low-PHD3 
leukemia cells, while viability was maintained for high-PHD3 K562 cells (Figures 4K–4N). 
Another high-PHD3 CML cell line, MEG01, was less sensitive to a high dose of ranolazine 
compared to low-PHD3 AML cells (Figures S3J and S3K). Sensitivity to FAO inhibition 
was more strongly linked to PHD3 status than to classification as AML or CML; a CML cell 
line with low PHD3 expression (KU812) was found to be sensitive to treatment with 
etomoxir and more closely resembled another low-PHD3 AML cell line (NB4) than a high-
PHD3 CML line (K562) (Figures S3K and S3L). Thus, blocking fatty acid catabolism has a 
strong cytotoxic effect specific to low-PHD3 leukemia cells.
In high-PHD3 K562 cells, PHD3 knockdown enabled higher FAO (Figures 4O and S3M), 
however it did not create a fixed dependency on FAO or cause susceptibility to FAO 
inhibitors (Figure 4P). K562 cells have a preference for glycolytic metabolism (Barger et al., 
2012), and although PHD3 knockdown allowed higher FAO, it did not force these cells to 
rely on fats. In contrast, cancer cells with low levels of PHD3 displayed limited metabolic 
plasticity, required sustained FAO and were particularly susceptible to pharmacological 
inhibitors of FAO. These data indicate that low PHD3 expression may be a promising 
candidate as a biomarker for leukemia cells that may be successfully targeted with FAO 
inhibitors.
Restoring PHD3 expression in AML limits FAO and cell growth through activation of ACC2
Our data suggest that low PHD3 expression is advantageous in AML by boosting FAO. We 
hypothesized that restoring PHD3 would limit the proliferation and potency of leukemia 
cells. Indeed, stable PHD3 overexpression repressed FAO by over 50% (Figures 5A and 
S4A), a level similar to that achieved by etomoxir (Figure S4B). This suggests that PHD3 
affects FAO at a magnitude similar to direct CPT1 inhibition. PHD3 overexpression also 
diminished cell proliferation and viability (Figures 5B–C and S5A–B).
To assess whether PHD3 overexpression was generally toxic, we overexpressed PHD3 in 
K562 cells. Endogenous PHD3 levels in MOLM14 and THP1 cells are 1% of that in K562 
German et al.

 cells (Figure 4G), and PHD3 overexpression in these cells achieved an amount roughly 10 to 
60-fold greater than that found in K562 cells (Figure S4A). PHD3 overexpression in K562 
cells had little effect on proliferation (Figures 5D–5F), suggesting PHD3 overexpression is 
not generally toxic. Moreover, knocking down PHD3 did not alter proliferation in K562 
cells (Figure 5G and S5C), supporting the idea that metabolic alterations due to modulating 
PHD3 are not detrimental to all cancer cells. Instead, low-PHD3 cancer cells uniquely 
experience severe effects when PHD3 is restored.
Our model suggests that PHD3 overexpression impairs AML cells by activating ACC2 and 
repressing fatty acid catabolism. To test directly the requirement for ACC, we assessed the 
effect of PHD3 overexpression when individual ACC isozymes were silenced. We generated 
MOLM14 cells that overexpressed PHD3 and also expressed shRNA against ACC2, ACC1 
or a non-silencing control. Importantly, shRNA were specific for each isozyme, and 
knockdown of one did not lead to compensatory upregulation of the other (Figures S4C and 
S4D). As anticipated, ACC2 knockdown amplified FAO more than ACC1 (Figure 5H), and 
knockdown of either isozyme enhanced cell growth (Figure 5I), fitting with previously 
established roles of the enzymes (Jeon et al., 2012). Strikingly, in the absence of ACC2, 
PHD3 overexpression was not able to blunt FAO or impair cellular proliferation (Figures 5H 
and 5I; PHD3 expression levels in Figure S4E). ACC1 was not required for these PHD3-
mediated phenotypes. Consistent results were obtained in THP1 cells (Figures 5J and S4F – 
S4I). These data clearly demonstrate that ACC2 is essential for the inhibitory action of 
PHD3 on FAO, AML survival and growth.
Restoring PHD3 expression impedes AML potency in cell culture and in vivo
After establishing that PHD3 alters AML cell metabolism and proliferation, we probed the 
impact of PHD3 overexpression on leukemic potency using colony formation assays to 
measure viable and functional progenitor cells. Overexpressing PHD3 dramatically 
decreased the number of clonogenic MOLM14 and THP1 cells in methylcellulose assays 
(Figures 6A and 6B). However in the absence of ACC2, AML colonies grew robustly 
regardless of PHD3 overexpression (Figures 6C and S6A). In contrast, PHD3 overexpression 
impaired clonogenic capacity independently of ACC1 (Figures 6C and S6A). We observed 
that high-PHD3 K562 cell colony formation is inherently less sensitive to PHD3 modulation 
(Figures 6D and 6E). These results indicate that the growth advantage of low-PHD3 AML 
cells is indeed due at least in part to PHD3 levels, and that re-introducing PHD3 is 
detrimental to this subset of leukemia. Moreover, ACC2 but not ACC1 is required for the 
inhibitory effects of PHD3.
We next asked whether PHD3 overexpression inhibits proliferation in primary AML 
samples. Leukemic cells from patient samples obtained from the University of Pennsylvania 
showed decreased PHD3 expression compared to healthy CD34+ control bone marrow cells 
(Figure 6F). Overexpressing PHD3 decreased proliferation in 2 of 3 samples, while the 
remaining sample trended toward a decrease (Figure 6G). PHD3 overexpression led to 
similar results in leukemic cells derived from the MLL/AF9 mouse model of AML. 
MLL/AF9 chromosomal translocation is a causative factor in a substantial subset of human 
AML and is associated with a 5-year survival rate of only 40% (Noordermeer et al., 2012).

 Compared to healthy CD11b control cells, PHD3 was strongly decreased in leukemic cells 
obtained from the MLL/AF9 mouse model of AML and decreased to a lesser extent in the 
Hoxa9 Meis1 mouse model of AML (Figure 6H). In MLL-AF9 lineage-negative bone 
marrow cells, PHD3 overexpression decreased AML clonogenic capacity (Figures 6I and 
6J). Thus, in low-PHD3 systems, PHD3 overexpression limits leukemic potency.
Finally, we evaluated the in vivo impact of PHD3 overexpression in low-PHD3 AML cells 
using an aggressive mouse xenotransplanation model. NOD-scid IL2Rgammanull (NSG) 
mice were chosen for this analysis due to their superiority in allowing engraftment of human 
AML cells (Shultz et al., 2005). Cohorts of NSG mice were injected via tail vein with 
MOLM14 cells overexpressing PHD3 or vector. The length of survival post-injection was 
used as a readout of AML severity. We observed that PHD3 overexpression in AML 
enhanced survival (Figure 6K). Taken together, these data strengthen our model that low-
PHD3 leukemia cells possess a metabolic liability rooted in ACC2 activation and a 
dependency on FAO, and that restoring PHD3 levels limits the proliferation and potency of 
AML cells.
DISCUSSION
Here we reveal a PHD3-mediated, nutrient-dependent signaling pathway. In response to 
nutrient abundance, PHD3 hydroxylates and activates ACC2 in order to repress 
mitochondrial FAO. The PHD3/ACC2 axis couples cellular nutrient status with dynamic 
regulation of FAO via a mechanism that is parallel to, but distinct from, AMPK. When 
cellular energy supplies are low, AMPK inhibits ACC2 to activate FAO and restore 
bioenergetic homeostasis (Cho et al., 2010). Here we reveal that PHD3 contributes to 
regulation of this metabolic node by activating ACC2 and limiting FAO when nutrients are 
abundant, thus enabling fuel conservation and metabolic efficiency. Together, AMPK and 
PHD3 can achieve dual modulation of FAO in response to changing nutrient levels. From 
our studies, a strong correlation between ACC2 hydroxylation and oligomerization could not 
be seen, but it will be interesting for future studies to explore in detail any possible feedback 
between PHD3 and AMPK. The link between PHD3 and nutrient status aligns with previous 
reports suggesting that PHD3 might be sensitive to α-ketoglutarate abundance, or more 
generally to a high nutrient state achieved by addition of α-ketoglutarate (Koivunen et al., 
2007). We hypothesize that PHD3 may be responsive to a pool of α-ketoglutarate near the 
outer mitochondrial membrane, in close proximity to ACC2. Although there is not currently 
a robust and reliable technique for measuring different intracellular pools of α-ketoglutarate, 
future advancements in metabolomics may make investigating this idea possible.
Because PHD3 acts on ACC2 and not ACC1, PHD3 loss may provide a way for the cell to 
elevate FAO while maintaining lipid synthesis. One traditional view of lipid metabolism 
considers both ACC isozymes to be similarly regulated, such that FAO is suppressed when 
lipogenesis is elevated, and vice versa. However, our results support a mechanism by which 
PHD3 can specifically activate ACC2 in order to repress FAO, without impinging upon lipid 
synthesis. Studies of calorie restriction establish a precedent for this idea – collectively, three 
studies in c. elegans indicate that FAO and lipogenesis can be concurrently upregulated 
(Amrit, 2016; Ratnappan et al., 2014; Steinbaugh et al., 2015). Further studies are needed to

 identify how PHD3 specifically targets ACC2, perhaps via localization to the outer 
mitochondrial membrane.
Our studies offer insight into mechanisms that drive fatty acid addiction in tumors. We find 
that reduced PHD3 expression is a common feature of AML that enables amplification of 
FAO. The regulatory node revealed here may have implications for a broad range of cancers. 
In addition to AML, PHD3 is epigenetically silenced due to promoter hypermethylation in 
patient samples of glioblastoma, B-cell lymphoma subtypes, invasive breast cancer and 
multiple myeloma, as well as in some prostate and colon cancer cell lines (Rawluszko et al., 
2013). Several of these cancers are linked to FAO dependency, in particular prostate, 
colorectal and breast cancers, as well as B-cell lymphoma subtypes (Carracedo et al., 2013; 
Liu et al., 2013). Thus, it is possible that PHD3 loss may play a role in driving FAO in these 
settings as well. PHD3 suppression likely is not the only determinant of FAO dependency in 
cancer, in the same way that multiple enzymes contribute to increased glycolysis in other 
tumor types. For example, PML and PPARδ have been linked to the maintenance and 
function of HSCs (Ito et al., 2012), and future studies may reveal the role of other enzymes 
in cancer cell reliance on fats.
Our data suggest a unique opportunity in the treatment of hematological malignancies. FAO 
inhibitors are promising candidates for consideration in cancer treatment (Carracedo et al., 
2013; Heřmanová et al., 2015; Rodríguez-Enríquez et al., 2015). The utility of FAO 
inhibitors would be greatly aided by biomarkers that identify individuals who might most 
likely benefit from such a treatment. Based on the knowledge of the regulatory axis 
identified here, low PHD3 expression could be considered as a marker in cancer to identify 
patients who may be successfully treated with FAO inhibitors, thus moving the field toward 
metabolically-based treatment options in the future.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Mass Spectrometry
To identify hydroxyproline sites, ACC2 was transiently overexpressed in 293T cells and 
immunoprecipitated with ACC2 antibody (Cell Signaling). Bound material was washed and 
separated by SDS-PAGE. The Coomassie stained band was analyzed by LC-MS2 and 
searched against the Uniprot Human database using Sequest with proline hydroxylation set 
as a variable modification (+15.9949 MW shift).
ACC Activity
Reactions were performed with 50 μg 293T cell protein lysates as previously described 
(Pulinilkunnil et al., 2011), with the exception of using 16.7 mM MgCl2. Further details 
provided in supplemental procedures.
Growth Curves
Live cells were sorted by FACS on day 0, then counted and plated in the wells of a 24 well 
or 96 well plate. At indicated times, cells were counted on the Beckman Z1 Coulter Counter.

 Colony-Forming Cell Assays
After sorting for live leukemic cells, cells were resuspended in methylcellulose-based 
medium (MethoCult H4434 or M3434, StemCell Technologies) in the presence of 
puromycin and also hygromycin, where indicated. For K562, 375 cells were plated per well 
of a 6-well plate. For MOLM14, THP1 and MLL-AF9 cells, 5,000 cells were plated. CFU 
were counted 8–21 d later.
Xenotransplantation Studies
Male NOD-scid IL2Rgammanull (NSG) mice were obtained from Jackson Labs and housed 
in specific pathogen-free environments. Mice were 7 wk at the time of xenotransplantation. 
On day 0, mice were sublethally irradiated (2.5 Gy) and injected via tail vein with 7 x 105 
Molm14 cells overexpressing vector or HA-PHD3 in 250 μl PBS. Statistical evaluation of 
survival was based on the log-rank test as well as the Gehan-Breslow-Wilcoxon test for 
comparison of the Kaplan-Meier curves.
Statistical Analysis
Unpaired two-tailed Student’s t tests were used for comparison of FAO, gene expression, 
activity assays and growth and cell viability experiments. All experiments were performed at 
least 2–3 times.

(J) In vitro hydroxylation assay. ACC2 peptides (12.5 nmol) with the indicated proline 
residue were incubated in reactions containing 0.02 μmol [1-14C]α-ketoglutarate and 1.2 μg 
recombinant PHD3. [14C]CO2 formed upon hydroxylation was captured on Whatman paper 
inside capped vials and analyzed by scintillation counting (n = 2). ***p < 0.001. Data

 Figure 2. Hydroxylation at site P450 promotes ACC2 activity and ATP binding
(A) Residue P450 (purple) in ACC2 is conserved in the ATP grasp domain throughout 
species. Alignment shows the ACC2 isoform in human, rat and mouse, and ACC in C. 
elegans, drosophila and S. cerevisiae, organisms lacking distinct ACC isoforms. Other 
conserved residues are in green.
(B) P450 (purple) is located in the ACC2 ATP-grasp domain (green) adjacent to the catalytic 
site ATP (magenta). ATP is capped at the phosphate end by the known nucleotide binding 
residues (orange). This model was generated by superposition of human ACC2 biotin 
carboxylase domain (PDB: 3JRW) with e. coli ATP-bound ACC biotin carboxylase domain 
(PDB: 1DV2).
(C) ATP-affinity of overexpressed WT versus P450A ACC2. ATP-binding was assessed by 
IP with ATP-affinity resin (Jena Bioscience) and immunoblot with ACC antibody. Relative 
levels were quantified by ImageJ.
(D) ATP-affinity assay of transiently overexpressed ACC2 from 293T cells stably expressing 
shRNA against PHD3 or non-targeting control. Bound ACC2 was analyzed by immunoblot 
and quantified by ImageJ.
(E) ACC activity in cells overexpressing vector, WT ACC2 or P450A mutant (n = 3). 10 μg 
ACC2 plasmid was overexpressed. Reactions (50 μg protein lysate) were performed ± 2 mM 
citrate. Immunoblots show loading controls.
(F) ACC activity in cells co-overexpressing ACC2 or P450A and HA-PHD3 or empty vector 
(n = 4). 10 μg HA-PHD3 or vector was overexpressed plus 2 μg ACC2 plasmid. Less ACC2 
plasmid was required here compared to (E) so the additive effect of PHD3 could be better 
observed. Reactions were done with citrate.

 (D–E) Palmitate oxidation in HIF-deficient mouse hepatoma 4 (B13NBii1) cells. FAO was 
assessed 48 h after transfection with human HA-PHD3 or vector or with siPHD3 or 
siControl (n = 3).
(F) Validation of HIF deficiency in HIFβ-null hepatoma cells. PHD3 expression and HIF 
target gene expression in HIFβ-deficient cells transfected with siRNA against PHD3 or 
control, and treated with or without the HIFα-stabilizing compound CoCl2 (250 μM, 6 h) (n 
= 4).
(G) Immunoblot of HIF1α and 2α levels in 293T cells with PHD3 knockdown or control. 
HIFα was made more identifiable by 6 h treatment with 250 μM CoCl2 in separate control 
samples.
(H) Effect of PHD3 knockdown on palmitate oxidation in 786-O VHL−/− cells (n = 3).
(I) Palmitate oxidation in 293T cells following 12 h pre-incubation in normoxia or hypoxia 
(1% O2). Cells were maintained under normoxia or hypoxia during FAO analysis (n = 4).
(J) Palmitate oxidation in WT versus AMPKα KO MEFs expressing shRNA against PHD3 
or non-silencing control (n = 3).
(K) ACC hydroxylation in 293T cells following 12 h incubation in high versus low nutrient 
medium. High nutrient DMEM contains 4.5 g/L glucose and serum. Low nutrient DMEM 
contains 1 g/L glucose without serum. ACC was immunoprecipitated and hydroxylation was 
detected by immunoblot.
(L) 293T cells expressing shRNA against PHD3 or control were incubated 12 h in high or 
low nutrient media prior to analyzing ACC hydroxylation.
(M) ACC hydroxylation dynamically responds to cellular nutrient cues. WT immortalized 
MEFs were incubated in high or low nutrient medium for 6 h, or in low nutrient medium for 
6 h followed by adding back high nutrient medium for 5 or 10 min. ACC-IP was performed 
in lysis buffer containing the PHD inhibitor DMOG (1 mM) to minimize hydroxylation in 
the lysis buffer. Hydroxylation was detected by immunoblot.
(N) Impact of PHD3 knockdown on the ability of MEFs to modulate FAO in response to low 
or high nutrient medium (n = 3).
(O) Impact of PHD3 knockdown on the ability of 293T cells to suppress FAO in response to 
supplementing low glucose, serum-free medium with dimethyl ketoglutarate (+kg, 5 mM) 
for 6 h prior to and during 2 hr FAO analysis (n = 3).
(P) Acylcarnitine levels measured by metabolomics analysis of 293T cells grown in high 
nutrient medium following stable knockdown of PHD3 or control. Levels were normalized 
to cell count in parallel plates (n = 6 for control, n = 3 for shPHD3).
(Q) Two-part model of ACC2 regulation. Under low nutrient conditions, AMPK responds to 
the AMP/ATP ratio to phosphorylate and inhibit ACC2, thus promoting long chain FAO. 
Under high nutrient conditions, PHD3 hydroxylates and activates ACC2 to limit long chain 
FAO.

KG1, THP1, NB4 and U937 = AML cell lines.
(H) ACC2 hydroxylation in leukemia cell lines. Because the ACC2 antibody does not work 
well for detecting endogenous input levels of ACC2 by immunoblot, an ACC antibody was 
used to show input.

(J) Palmitate oxidation by leukemia cell lines in complete medium (n = 3).
(K–L) Viability of leukemia cells assessed by PI staining and FACS after 96 h treatment 
with etomoxir (n = 3). All data points with drug treatment are significant by p < 0.001 for all 
cell lines compared to K562. Bar graph highlights sensitivity to 150 μM etomoxir.
(M–N) Viability of leukemia cells after 96 h treatment with ranolazine (n = 3). All data 
points with drug treatment are significant by at least p < 0.05 or p < 0.01 compared to K562.

(O) PHD3 knockdown boosts FAO in K562 cells (n = 3).
(P) In K562 cells that normally express high PHD3, PHD3 knockdown does not create a 
dependency on FAO. K562 cells expressing shPHD3 or shControl were treated 96 h +/− 
ranolazine, and viability was assessed by PI staining (n = 3).

ACC2-dependent manner
(A) Palmitate oxidation in MOLM14 and THP1 cells following stable overexpression of 
empty vector or PHD3 (n = 3). Immunoblots show stable overexpression of HA-PHD3.
(B) Growth curves of MOLM14 and THP1 cells overexpressing vector or PHD3 (n = 3).
(C) ATP CellTiter-Glo analysis in MOLM14 and THP1 cells overexpressing vector or PHD3 
(n = 4).
(D–E) PHD3 gene expression (n = 3) and immunoblot in K562 cells following 
overexpression of PHD3 or vector.
(F–G) Growth curves of K562 cells overexpressing HA-PHD3 or empty vector (n = 3), or 
shRNA against PHD3 or control.
(H) ACC2, but not ACC1, is required for PHD3 to repress palmitate oxidation in MOLM14 
cells (n = 3). Cells were first infected with lentivirus expressing shRNA against ACC 
isozymes or control and conferring puromycin resistance. Following puromycin selection, 
PI-negative cells were sorted by FACS. These cells were infected with PHD3 or vector 
conferring hygromycin resistence. Following selection with hygromycin D, PI-negative cells 
were collected and used for subsequent assays.
(I–J) Overexpressed PHD3 acts through ACC2, but not ACC1, to blunt AML cell 
proliferation. Growth curves were assessed by cell counting in MOLM14 and THP1 cells 
following knockdown of ACC1 or ACC2, as well as overexpression of empty vector or 
PHD3 (n = 3). Relative cell number at 72 h, compared to count at time 0, is highlighted on 
the right. MOLM14 cells were generated as above. THP1 cells were generated by viral
