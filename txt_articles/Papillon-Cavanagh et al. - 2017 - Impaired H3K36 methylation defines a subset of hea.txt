Abstract
Human papillomavirus negative (HPV-) head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) are 
deadly and common cancers. Recent genomic studies implicate multiple genetic pathways 
including cell-signalling, cell-cycle and/or immune evasion in their development. Here, we 
analyze public datasets and uncover a previously unappreciated role of epigenome deregulation in 
the genesis of 13% HPV-HNSCCs. Specifically, we identify novel recurrent p.K36M mutations 
occurring in multiple histone H3 genes. We further validate their presence in multiple independent 
HNSCC datasets and show that along with previously described NSD1 mutations, they correspond 
to a specific DNA methylation cluster. H3K36M and NSD1 defects converge on altering H3K36 
methylation, subsequently blocking cellular differentiation and promoting oncogenesis. Our data 
further indicate surprisingly limited redundancy for NSD family members in HPV-HNSCCs and 
suggest a potential role of impaired H3K36 methylation in their development. Further 
investigation of drugs targeting chromatin regulators is warranted in HPV-HNSCCs driven by 
aberrant H3K36 methylation.
Introduction
Head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) are a heterogeneous group of tumours 
that develop through chemical - as a result of tobacco and/or alcohol abuse - or viral-induced 
carcinogenesis following infection with high-risk human papillomaviruses (HPV+)1. They 
represent the seventh most frequent cancer worldwide with ~600,000 new cases per year2 
and occur throughout the oral cavity, hypopharynx, oropharynx, nasopharynx, or larynx. 
Tumors are often locally advanced invading proximal structures at diagnosis or show spread 
to cervical lymph nodes or distant metastases. Despite several advances and innovations in 
multimodality treatment, survival rates of locally advanced HNSCC have not substantially 
improved, and the prognosis for relapsed or metastatic tumors remains dismal3.
Several studies, including a recent comprehensive genomic profiling of a vast number of 
tumors by The Cancer Genome Atlas Project (TCGA), have shown that HPV negative 
(HPV-) and HPV+ HNSCC represent distinct disease entities4–6. The latter, which mainly 
arises in the oropharynx (tonsils and base of tongue), is associated with a substantially 
improved outcome and harbors distinct molecular alterations3,6,7. The vast majority of HPV- 
tumors have loss-of-function TP53 mutations and CDKN2A inactivation. Integrated 
genomic and DNA methylation analysis indicated a high level of heterogeneity in this entity

 with the presence of several molecular clusters seemingly enriched for specific genetic 
alterations6. These studies also identified frequent alterations in pathways involving growth 
factor receptors, RAS and PI3K signalling, the cell cycle, cell death and differentiation, 
and/or oxidative stress, which have thus become the focus of current research efforts and 
targeted therapies in HNSCCs3–6,8–13. Interestingly, novel genetic alterations in an 
epigenetic modulator Nuclear receptor-binding SET Domain protein 1 (NSD1) were recently 
listed in HPV-HNSCCs but insights into whether or how these mutations could drive 
oncogenesis are lacking6,12.
NSD1 is a member of a family of mammalian histone methyltransferases (NSD1, NSD2/
MMSET/WHSC1, NSD3/WHSC1L1) that are essential in development. NSD family 
enzymes act as mono- and di-methyltransferases for histone H3 lysine 36 (H3K36, reviewed 
in14), while SETD2 mediates trimethylation of H3K36, a chromatin mark associated with 
active transcription, gene splicing, and DNA damage repair. Notably, aberrant regulation of 
H3K36 methylation has been recently identified in several neoplasms and could potentially 
promote oncogenesis15–20. Germline hypomorphic NSD1 mutations lead to the SOTOS 
overgrowth syndrome, where patients are more prone to cancer21. Somatic translocation and 
gain-of-function mutations involving NSD2 have been identified in leukemia and multiple 
myeloma, while NSD1 loss-of-function mutations have been described in lung cancers22. In 
AML, the recurring t(5;11)(q35;p15.5) translocation fuses NSD1 to nucleoporin-98 
(NUP98) and leads to leukemogenesis through aberrant establishment of H3K36 
methylation at specific genomic loci16. SETD2 mutations have also been described in a wide 
range of cancers15,19,23. Therefore, we reasoned that an abnormal epigenetic landscape, 
through alterations in the H3K36 methylation pathway, might constitute a previously 
unappreciated mechanism in the development of HPV-HNSCCs. To this end, we performed 
an integrative analysis of existing genomic and DNA methylation datasets of HNSCCs to 
assess the functional impact of NSD1 alterations and investigated the presence of other 
genetic alterations affecting the post-translational modifications of histones including 
H3K36. Our results characterize an epigenetically distinct subgroup in HPV-HNSCCs, 
where the main genetic alterations converge to specifically disrupt H3K36 methylation, 
potentially driving oncogenesis.
Results
TCGA HNSCC dataset reanalysis
To assess the prevalence and nature of the genetic alterations affecting the epigenome in 
HNSCCs, we analyzed available HNSCC studies with reported results from next generation 
sequencing and DNA methylation profiling4–6,10,11. The TCGA dataset, the largest 
generated on HNSCCs, had DNA methylation data (450K arrays) available for 528 samples, 
whole-exome sequencing (WES) for 526 samples, and RNA sequencing for 520. A total of 
518 samples were profiled on all three platforms (Supplementary Figure 1). We performed 
unsupervised hierarchical clustering of DNA methylation data (Figure 1) and identified a 
subgroup previously found to be enriched in NSD1 mutations. This subgroup was comprised 
of 61 samples, including 44 samples which carried damaging single nucleotide variants in 
NSD1 annotated in the initial TCGA analysis6 (Supplementary Figure 2C, Supplementary

 Table 1). Upon closer inspection of the primary data, we found that other tumors within this 
cluster had more complex genomic events including large chromosomal deletions 
encompassing this gene (n = 2), focal deletions within NSD1 (n = 2) or splicing defects (n = 
1). Analysis of RNA-seq data showed absent NSD1 transcripts in two samples with non-
interpretable WES data. In one sample, no conclusion could be drawn on NSD1 mutational 
status as only methylation data was available (Supplementary Table 2 & Supplementary 
Figure 3). Overall, the reanalysis indicated that 51/61 (84%) of samples within this 
methylation cluster carried NSD1 alterations. Notably, the vast majority of missense 
mutations in NSD1 in this cluster were located close to or within the functional SET domain 
and were frequently associated with additional truncating mutations in the same samples 
(Supplementary Figure 2C). In silico prediction of the functional impact of these 
mutations24 suggests that they likely compromise the methyltransferase activity of the 
enzyme (Supplementary Table 1). Two of these missense mutations were previously reported 
in SOTOS syndrome, a genetic disorder associated with germline NSD1 mutations21 
including p.R2005Q, which has been shown to specifically ablate H3K36-methyltransferase 
activity25. The methylation-based clustering also clearly identified an HPV+/TP53 wild-type 
tumour subgroup, which is known to constitute a distinct entity within HNSCCs, along with 
three other clusters we labelled A, B and C that had no clear relationship to known 
alterations in HNSCC. NSD1 mutations/alterations were infrequent (4%), and were mostly 
missense and predicted to be less damaging in these clusters (Figure 1, Supplementary Table 
3).
Identification of H3K36M mutations in HNSCC
Given the high prevalence of NSD1 mutations in this DNA methylation cluster, we 
investigated the mutational status of other genes involved in H3K36 methylation. We 
identified 11 samples harboring p.K36M mutations in various histone H3 genes. The 
mutations occurred either in genes encoding the canonical histone H3.1/2 or the variant 
histone H3.3 (Supplementary Figure 2B, Supplementary Table 4). Remarkably, 10 of the 
H3K36M mutants occurred within the DNA methylation cluster predominantly defined by 
NSD1 defects (Figure 1, Supplementary Figure 2A–B). Taken together H3K36M and NSD1 
mutations accounted for all samples with available genomic data (Supplementary Figure 2A) 
included in the DNA methylation derived cluster (thus labeled the H3K36 cluster) and 
jointly represent 13% of HPV-HNSCC. Only one sample with a H3K36M mutation was 
observed outside the H3K36 cluster (Figure 1). Other genes encoding potential H3K36 
methyltransferases, including SETD2 and NSD2/WHSC1, were infrequently mutated in 
HNSCC and samples with these mutations were spread across all HNSCC methylation 
subgroups (Supplementary Figure 4).
Clinical and molecular features of the H3K36 HNSCC subgroup
A number of altered genes have been identified to be enriched in HPV-
HNSCCs4–6,8–10,12,26–28, including TP53, EGFR, NOTCH1, PI3KCA and HRAS. We found 
that only the prevalence of TP53 and CASP8 significantly vary among HNSCC methylation 
subgroups. (Figure 1, Supplementary Figure 4). Similarly, there were no copy number 
alterations specific to the H3K36 cluster (data not shown). Consistent with the original 
TCGA report, we found tumors within this cluster to be strongly DNA hypomethylated (p <

 1.99e-14, Student’s t-test) with no difference between H3K36M and NSD1 mutants (p = 
0.36, Student’s t-test, Supplementary Figure 5), suggesting that the unique DNA methylation 
signature of the H3K36 cluster is driven by defects in the H3K36 methylation pathway. 
NSD1-mutated samples within the H3K36 cluster showed a lower NSD1 expression 
(Student’s t-test, p = 0.0007), global DNA hypomethylation (Student’s t-test, p = 1.41e-6) 
and more truncating mutations compared to NSD1-mutated samples outside the H3K36 
cluster (Supplementary Figure 6).
The H3K36 cluster included tumors from heavy smokers or heavy smokers who had recently 
quit smoking (Figure 1). When assessing the mutational burden in a given cluster, NSD1 
mutant tumors were hypermutated (p < 0.0004, Student’s t-test), while H3K36M mutant 
samples had similar number of mutations per sample compared to the other methylation 
clusters (Supplementary Figure 7). Notably, when we analyzed the somatic mutational 
pattern in relation to smoking, the signatures we obtained for each molecular entity showed 
that NSD1 but not H3K36M mutants had a mutational signature strongly associated with 
smoking (Supplementary Figure 8). Except for HPV+ cancers, which are associated with a 
favorable outcome, there were no differences in tumor grade or outcome among HPV-
HNSCCs (Supplementary Figure 9). Moreover, we observed distinct anatomical locations 
for samples within the H3K36 cluster: all H3K36M tumors (100%, 10/10) occurred in the 
oral cavity while NSD1 mutant tumors localized more often in the larynx (29/51, 57%, p < 
0.007, Chi-Square test) (Figure 2, Supplementary Figure 10). No other clinical feature 
reached a statistically significant enrichment (Supplementary Table 5). We also re-analyzed 
four other available WES datasets on HNSCCs. In combination (196 samples in total), these 
studies led us to identify 14 NSD1 mutations, most of which were located in the larynx, and 
one HIST3H3H p.K36M in the oral cavity4,5,29,30. Those 15 patients were HPV- and heavy 
smokers, consistent with our findings using the TCGA dataset (Figure 1, Supplementary 
Table 6).
Effects of NSD1 and H3K36M mutations on epigenome and transcriptome
An independent cohort of 158 oropharyngeal HPV+ (n = 78) and HPV- (n = 80) HNSCCs 
with available tissue microarrays (TMA) was assembled to determine the prevalence and 
impact of H3K36M mutations on H3K36 methylation. Immunohistochemistry analysis 
identified three samples with typical nuclear staining of H3K36M, confirming the protein 
expression of the mutant histone in HNSCC tumor tissues in this independent cohort (Figure 
3). We have previously shown that K-to-M substitutions at H3K36, although affecting only 
one of the 32 alleles encoding histone H3, act as dominant mutations and inhibit the 
respective SET-domain containing methyltransferases leading to decreased di- and tri-
methylation of H3K3631,32. As expected, immunohistochemical staining of H3K36me2 and 
H3K36me3 of the TMAs showed that samples carrying H3K36M have a drastic decrease in 
their K36me2/me3 levels (Figure 3). In tumor cores lacking NSD1 staining, global levels of 
H3K36me3 were mostly unchanged while, as expected, H3K36me2 levels were markedly 
reduced, in keeping with the role of NSD1 as a di- but not tri-methyltransferase for H3K36 
(Figure 3).

 We also obtained two HNSCC cell lines carrying NSD1 truncating mutations (SCC-4 and 
SKN-3) and two cell lines wild-type for NSD1 (Fadu and PCI-4B). Immunoblotting and 
mass spectrometry analyses revealed a marked decrease in H3K36me2 levels and relatively 
preserved H3K36me3 levels in histone extracts from the NSD1 mutant cell lines (Figure 4A, 
D, E). Ectopic expression of H3K36M in HEK293 embryonic kidney cells, two HNSCC cell 
lines wild-type for H3 and NSD1, and an NSD1-deficient HNSCC cell line led to a 
significant decrease in H3K36me2/3 levels similar to that observed in HNSCC patient TMA 
samples, while siRNA knockdown of NSD1 specifically led to decreased H3K36me2 
(Figure 4B–E). These findings suggest that both mutations may contribute to the progression 
of HNSCC through reducing H3K36me2. It is of interest that H3K36me2 levels were 
significantly altered despite a relatively normal expression of NSD2 in NSD1 mutant 
HNSCC samples and cell lines (p >0.22, Student’s t-test) (Figure 4A & Supplementary 
Figure 11). Furthermore, knockdown of NSD1 resulted in a more pronounced reduction in 
H3K36me2 in HNSCC cells compared to HEK293 cells (Figure 4C). These results highlight 
a major and non-redundant role of NSD1 in establishing H3K36me2 in HNSCC.
Finally, we analyzed transcriptome data available with the TCGA dataset and were able to 
identify a cluster that corresponds, to a large extent, to the DNA methylation-defined H3K36 
subgroup (Supplementary Figure 12), suggesting that altered methylation at H3K36 affects 
both the epigenome and transcriptome in HNSCC patient samples. We next performed 
differential expression analysis focusing on genes that are differentially expressed between 
H3K36 and other HNSCC subgroups. Our results indicate that NSD1 and H3K36M mutants 
specifically suppressed the expression of genes involved in epidermal differentiation and 
keratinization processes (Supplementary Figure 13 & Supplementary Table 7). These 
findings mirror our recent data in mouse mesenchymal progenitor cells where 
overexpression of H3K36M resulted in a blockade in differentiation to the respective 
downstream lineages and induced undifferentiated sarcomas in mice32.
Discussion
In this study, we re-analyzed public genomic and epigenomic datasets from HNSCCs and 
identified a previously largely unappreciated role of epigenome deregulation in HNSCC 
tumorigenesis, specifically at lysine 36 of histone H3. Our unsupervised clustering approach 
using DNA methylation data segregated 61 HNSCC samples into a cluster we labeled 
H3K36. This DNA methylation cluster is exclusively comprised of samples carrying NSD1 
alterations or H3K36M mutations reported here for the first time in HNSCC. Characterized 
by H3K36 alteration and DNA hypomethylation, this subgroup represents a significant 
subset of HPV-tumors (13%). Other clusters include a subgroup highly enriched in HPV+ 
samples along with Groups A B C, which do not harbor obviously defining clinico-
pathological features or genetic alterations. Except for HPV+ cancers, we did not observe 
any statistically significant differences in event-free survival among methylation clusters. 
This may be due to the relatively short median follow-up time (401 days) of the TCGA 
HNSCC cohort. When using a similar unsupervised clustering approach on RNA-Seq data 
(Supplementary Figure 12), we are also able to recuperate a group of samples enriched in 
NSD1 or H3K36M mutations suggesting that the H3K36 cluster corresponds to a specific 
molecular entity.

 In depth analysis of the NSD1 locus in samples included in the H3K36 subgroup allowed us 
to identify alterations such as splicing defects and focal deletion of a small set of exons that 
were not detectable using standard automated approaches (Supplementary Table 2). 
Moreover, a gene-based approach has previously failed to identify the enrichment of 
H3K36M substitutions as they are observed in a wide array of histone H3 genes 
(Supplementary Figure 2B & Supplementary Table 4). This is consistent with our previous 
work, which demonstrated that the effect of H3K36M mutation is dominant and independent 
of H3 isoforms31,32 (Figures 3 & 4). A complementary meta-analysis of earlier studies 
confirmed the prevalence of H3K36M and NSD1 alterations in HNSCC and their 
association with smoking and specific anatomical locations.
We replicated our genomic findings using an independent, previously unpublished cohort of 
HNSCC patient samples and showed that the mutant histone is expressed exclusively in 
tumor cells and leads to decreased H3K36me2 and me3 (Figure 3). In contrast, NSD1 loss 
leads to decreased H3K36me2 (Figures 3 & 4), consistent with previous biochemical 
characterization of the enzyme as a specific H3K36 mono- and di-methyltransferase. Given 
the converging effects of NSD1 and H3K36M mutations on DNA methylation and 
H3K36me2, it appears that these mutations may help drive HNSCC pathogenesis through a 
common mechanism involving epigenome deregulation. H3K36M mutations have been 
observed in chondroblastoma17 and more recently in pediatric soft-tissue tumors32. Our 
group also showed that when introduced into mesenchymal progenitor cells, H3K36M was 
sufficient to induce undifferentiated sarcomas in mice by blocking cellular differentiation32. 
Our transcriptome analysis reveals that genes specifically downregulated in the H3K36 
subgroup are involved in cellular differentiation. These results support a model whereby an 
altered epigenetic landscape, mediated by the impaired H3K36 methylation subsequent to 
the genetic alterations, arrests keratinocytes in a progenitor state refractory to differentiation 
stimuli. This differentiation blockade in turn synergizes with signalling and cell cycle 
deregulation to facilitate HNSCC development.
Interestingly, no NSD2/WHSC1 mutation was found in the H3K36 subgroup and NSD1 
deficiency was sufficient to decrease H3K36me2 in HNSCC cell lines despite the normal 
expression of NSD2. Moreover, a recent report showed overexpression of NSD2/WHSC1 
and increased H3K36me2 in a set of HNSCC samples examined35. Therefore, it appears that 
NSD1 and NSD2 may play non-redundant roles in certain cell types and that their effect 
could vary based on the DNA methylation group. Further studies are warranted to investigate 
the distinct mechanisms by which gain or loss of H3K36me2 promotes HNSCC 
development.
The H3K36 cluster showed marked DNA hypomethylation compared to the other 
methylation subgroups. Interestingly, a recent study observed a DNA hypomethylation 
signature in SOTOS syndrome, a monogenic disorder defined by germline mutations in 
NSD136. Therefore, the DNA hypomethylation signature in the H3K36 subgroup is likely 
caused by genetic or K36M-mediated biochemical inactivation of NSD1. Several recent 
reports suggest a link between H3K36 methylation and the binding of de novo DNA 
methyltransferases DNMT3A/B37,38. The PWWP domain of DNMT3A, which is essential 
for its chromatin recruitment, specifically binds to H3K36me2/me3. In agreement, the gene-

 body localization of Dnmt3b in mouse embryonic stem cells depends on Setd2-mediated 
H3K36me3. Therefore the recruitment of DNMT3A/B could be potentially impaired in 
NSD1 or H3K36M mutant tumors, leading to the global DNA hypomethylation phenotype 
observed in the H3K36 cluster.
Large and comprehensive genomic and epigenomic surveys of HNSCCs have increased our 
understanding of the key driver mutations and heterogenic nature of this disease. Most of 
these studies emphasize the role of alterations affecting the cell cycle (TP53, CDKN2A) or 
signalling pathways including growth factor receptors (FGFR, EGFR), the RAS and PI3K 
pathways. Accordingly, a number of novel targeted therapies tailored to attenuate signalling 
defects are currently investigated in pre-clinical studies and clinical trials. However, recent 
studies in HNSCCs indicate that recurrent or metastatic tumors often fail to reproduce the 
mutational landscape of the primary tumor, specifically for the aforementioned targetable 
alterations10. In contrast, this evolutionary dynamic has not been observed in tumors 
carrying epigenetic drivers. Indeed, in the previously studied cancers that are promoted by 
mutations in epigenetic modulators, such as DNMT3A, IDH39 or histone H340, the 
epigenetic drivers are invariably present throughout the course of the disease. Our current 
study uncovers a previously unsuspected role of impaired H3K36 methylation in HNSCCs. 
This finding underscores the need for further investigations into the mechanisms of 
epigenome deregulation in HNSCC tumorigenesis, as targeting epigenetic modifiers may be, 
when further validated by additional in vitro and in vivo studies, of therapeutic benefit for 
HNSCC patients with altered H3K36 methylation.
Online Methods
DNA Methylation Clustering
We obtained the Level 1 (IDAT format) methylation data from the TCGA data portal for 528 
HNSCC samples. We extracted raw beta values using the R package minfi41. We removed 
probes that contained or targeted SNPs as per the Illumina HumanMethylation450k 
Manifest. We performed hierarchical clustering using the 1,000 most variable sites. Distance 
was assessed using d = 1 − r, where r is the Pearson product-moment coefficient. Clustering 
was performed using average linkage (UPGMA). In order to establish robustness of our 
groups, we tested their predictive ability using a 10-fold cross-validation. We computed the 
sample-by-sample correlation between the test and training and averaged on the training set 
subgroups. The test set labels were predicted according to the highest average correlation 
among the training set subgroup.
Somatic Mutations
We used all the somatic mutation calls from Level 2 (MAF format) data from the TCGA 
data portal for 517 samples. We merged calls from the different sequencing centers, removed 
duplicates and converted MAF to VCF using a custom script. We annotated the resulting 
comprehensive mutation list using ANNOVAR42 to obtain the resulting amino-acid changes.
In order to address the prevalence of specific mutations in HPV-HNSCC methylation 
subgroups, we performed an ANOVA on the presence or absence of mutation, excluding the

 HPV+ subgroup. In order to control for the mutation count per sample, we divided the 
presence of mutation (1) by the total amount of mutations, thus asking “Does the subgroup 
of a sample explain the variance observed in the fraction of mutations in a given gene”. 
Every gene was treated independently and p-values were corrected for multiple testing using 
Bonferroni.
To predict the impact of NSD1 missense mutations on the protein function, we used 
mutation assessor (http://mutationassessor.org) which evaluates the functional impact of an 
amino-acid substitution based on the evolutionary conservation of amino-acid residues in a 
protein family multiple sequence alignment, assuming that mutations that affect conserved 
residues are more likely to be functional.
Mutations in the H3K36 cluster
Samples in the H3K36 cluster not carrying a somatic H3K36M or NSD1 mutations were 
manually assessed at the NSD1 locus. We identified large chromosomal deletions containing 
NSD1 (n = 2), focal deletion of a set of exons (n = 2) or splicing defects (n = 1). RNA-seq 
analysis showed absent NSD1 transcripts in two samples with non-interpretable WES data 
and one sample in the cluster lacked genomic data (Supplementary Table 2). Lolipot plots 
were obtained from the mutation mapper tool (http://www.cbioportal.org/
mutation_mapper.jsp).
Clinical Annotation
Smoking: We tested for association with smoking using the 4-factor definition as per the 
CDR browser https://cdebrowser.nci.nih.gov/CDEBrowser/search?
listValidValuesForDataElements=9&tabClicked=2&PageId=DataElementConceptDetails). 
To test for enrichment for smoking in H3K36 samples, we performed a Fisher’s Exact Test 
on those factors.
Anatomical Location: Some anatomical locations were grouped together (as per http://
www.cancer.gov/types/head-and-neck/head-neck-fact-sheet#q1) in order to simplify the 
visual representation. Alveolar Ridge: {Alveolar Ridge}. Oral Cavity: {Buccal Mucosa, 
Floor of Mouth, Hard Palate, Oral Cavity, Oral Tongue}. Pharynx: {Base of Tongue, 
Hypopharynx, Oropharynx}. Larynx: {Larynx}. Tonsil: {Tonsil}
HPV Status: ISH and p16 tests were combined together so that sample flagged as HPV 
positive by either tests would be considered as HPV+ in our analysis. Vice versa for a 
negative diagnosis. Samples with no information were labeled as NA.
Copy Number Analysis
We obtained the Level 3 CNV calls from the TCGA data portal for 520 samples. We used 
the nocnv_hg19.seg.txt as input for GISTIC 2.0 to extract significant CNVs. We clustered 
samples based on CNV using the method previously described6. We considered NSD1 
GISTIC value of −0.3 as sufficient evidence for LOH.

 Mutation Signature
In order to infer the mutagenic processes in HNSCC subgroups, we used the somatic 
mutations obtained as described above. Samples from each methylation-defined subgroup 
were merged together because of the overall low amount of mutations from WES. We 
appended mutations from 8 TCGA cancers using the R package SomaticCancerAlterations. 
We extracted the mutational context (flanking nucleotides), extracted the somatic spectrum 
of each cancer and computed a 5 signature model using non-negative matrix decomposition 
using the R package SomaticSignatures. Hierarchical clustering was done on the somatic 
spectrum matrix using cosine distance.
RNA-Seq
We obtained raw bam files using gtdownload from cghub. Gene expression was quantified 
with featureCount43 using UCSC hg19 annotation with isoforms collapsed into a single 
entry per gene. We used the raw counts and normalized them for total library size using 
DESeq244. We performed hierarchical clustering using log2 transformed read count for the 
1,000 most variable genes. Distance was assessed using d = 1 − r, where r is the Pearson 
product-moment coefficient. Clustering was performed using average linkage (UPGMA). In 
order to obtain differentially expressed genes that are specific to the H3K36 cluster, we 
performed two independent differential expression analyses. We used all HNSCC tumor 
samples and looked for genes differentially expressed specifically in the H3K36 cluster, 
compared to all other subgroups using anatomical location as a covariate. The threshold for 
establishing if a gene was differentially expressed was: Bonferroni adjusted p-value < 0.01, 
and an absolute value of log2 fold change > 2.
Cell culture, siRNA transfection and lentiviral infection
Fadu (ATCC), SKN-3 (JCRB cell bank) and PCI-4B (University of Pittsburgh) cells were 
cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM, Invitrogen) with 10% fetal 
bovine serum (FBS, CellGro). SCC-4 (ATCC) cells were cultured in DMEM:F12 Medium 
(Invitrogen) with 10% FBS and 400 ng/ml hydrocortisone (Sigma). These HNSCC cell lines 
have been demonstrated to be tumorigenic45,46,47,48 and the NSD1 mutational status was 
obtained through COSMIC or Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia and verified by 
immunoblotting. For siRNA transfection, cells were reverse transfected with 
Lipofectamine® RNAiMAX (Life Technologies) and ON-TARGETplus SMARTpool siRNA 
against human NSD1 (GE Healthcare). After 72 h, cells were harvested for immunoblotting 
analysis. To generate cells stably expressing H3K36M mutant histone, cells were transduced 
with concentrated lentivirus (2 × 107 IFU) generated as previously described32. Transduced 
cells were grown under puromycin selection (2 µg/ml) 48 h after transduction and selected 
for a week before harvested for immunoblotting or mass spectrometry analysis.
Immunoblotting
For immunoblotting, acid-extracted histones or whole cell lysates were separated by SDS-
PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, blocked in 5% non-fat milk in PBS plus 
0.5% Tween-20, probed with primary antibodies, and detected with horseradish peroxidase-
conjugated α-rabbit or α-mouse secondary antibodies (GE Healthcare). Primary antibodies

 used include: αNSD1 (NeuroMab clone N312/10); αNSD2 (Millipore, MABE191); αNSD3 
(Abcam, ab180500); αSETD2 (Abcam, ab31358); αH3K36me3 (Active Motif, 61021); 
αH3K36me2 (Cell Signaling Tech, 2901); αH3K36M (gift of Millipore); αH3 (Abcam, 
ab1791); αTubulin (Cell Signaling Tech, 2144).
Immunohistochemistry
All samples were obtained with informed consent after approval of the Institutional Review 
Board of the respective hospitals they were treated in, and were independently reviewed by 
pathologists with expertise in Head and Neck cancer (W.S., C.J.H.). Tissue microarrays 
(TMA) from a collection of 158 patients with HNSCCs were obtained following standard 
procedures. Consecutive sections from the TMAs were cut at 4 µm, placed on SuperFrost/
Plus slides (Fisher) and dried overnight at 37°C, before IHC processing. The slides were 
then loaded onto the Discovery XT Autostainer (Ventana Medical System). All solutions 
used for automated IHC were from Ventana Medical System unless otherwise specified. 
Slides underwent deparaffinization, heat-induced epitope retrieval (CC1 prediluted solution 
Ref: 950–124, standard protocol). Immunostaining was performed online using a heat 
protocol. A negative control was performed by the omission of the primary antibody. Mouse 
monoclonal anti-H3K36me3 antibody (Diagenode Inc.) and anti-H3K36me2 (Cell Signaling 
Tech, 2901) were diluted at 1:500 in the antibody diluent (Ref: 251–018). Rabbit polyclonal 
anti-H3K36M antibody and anti-NSD1 (custom made by Millipore) were diluted at 1:22 and 
1:20 in the antibody diluent for 32 min at 37°C and subsequently processed as previously 
described32. Slides were counterstained with hematoxylin for 4 min, blued with Bluing 
Reagent for 4 min, removed from the autostainer, washed in warm soapy water, dehydrated 
through graded alcohols, cleared in xylene and mounted with Eukitt Mounting Medium 
(EMS, Ref: 15320). Sections were scanned using the aperio system. Scoring was done on 
100 tumor cells from 4 separate fields for all 4 antibodies. Staining was considered 
conclusive for H3K36M when strong specific nuclear staining was seen in tumor cells with 
no immunoreactivity in adjacent stroma; In the absence of genotype data, a tumor was 
considered as possibly carrying NSD1 mutation if more than 70% of tumor cells lacked 
nuclear staining while normal NSD1 nuclear staining could be seen in infiltrating 
inflammatory cells or adjacent stroma. H3K36me3 and H3K36me2 stains were similarly 
scored to NSD1.
Histone acid extraction, histone derivatization and PTM analysis by nano-LC-MS
Cells were lysed in hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mM HEPES, 10 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 
mM DTT, protease inhibitors) for 1 hr at 4°C. H2SO4 was added to 0.2 N followed by 
overnight rotation at 4°C. After centrifugation, supernatants were collected, proteins were 
precipitated in 33% TCA, washed with acetone, and resuspended in deionized water.
Acid-extracted histones (15–25 µg) were resuspended in 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate 
(pH 8), derivatized using propionic anhydride, and digested with trypsin as previously 
described49. The resulting histone peptides were desalted using C18 Stage Tips, dried using a 
centrifugal evaporator, and reconstituted using 0.1% formic acid in preparation for nanoLC-
MS analysis.

 nanoLC was performed using a Thermo Scientific™ Easy nLC™ 1000 system equipped 
with a 75 µm × 20 cm in-house packed column using Reprosil-Pur C18-AQ (3 µm; Dr. 
Maisch GmbH, Germany). Buffer A was 0.1% formic acid and Buffer B was 0.1% formic 
acid in 100% acetonitrile. Peptides were resolved using a two-step gradient from 0% to 26% 
B over 45 min, then from 26% B to 98% B over 10 min at a flow rate of 300 nL/min. The 
HPLC was coupled online to an Orbitrap Elite mass spectrometer operating in the positive 
mode using a Nanospray Flex™ Ion Source (Thermo Scientific) at 2.40 kV. MS was 
performed using data-independent acquisition (DIA) as previously described50 with slight 
modifications. Briefly, two full MS scans (m/z 300–1100) were acquired in the orbitrap with 
a resolution of 120,000 (at 200 m/z) every 8 DIA MS/MS events, using isolation windows of 
50 m/z each (e.g. 300–350, 350–400, etc.). The full MS scan was performed twice within the 
same duty cycle to allow for a more resolved definition of the precursor peak profile. 
MS/MS events were acquired in the ion trap operating in normal mode. Fragmentation was 
performed using collision-induced dissociation (CID) in the ion trap mass analyzer with a 
normalized collision energy of 35. AGC target and maximum injection time were 10e6 and 
50 ms for the full MS scan, and 10e4 and 150 ms for the MS/MS scan, respectively.
Mass-to-charge ratios were calculated for each modified form of H3 peptide. The area under 
the curve was calculated from extracted ion chromatograms using Xcalibur Qual Browser 
for each histone peptide mass-to-charge ratio using a 10 ppm mass accuracy cutoff. Data 
from all detectable charge states were summed. The area for each modification state of a 
peptide was normalized against the sum of all peptides sharing the same sequence to give the 
relative abundance of each modified state. Three biological replicates were analyzed per 
condition, and the relative abundance of each peptide modification was averaged across the 
runs. Statistical significance was determined using Student’s t-test.

 Figure 1. H3K36M and NSD1 mutations define a specific HNSCC subgroup
Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of DNA methylation data identifies 5 HNSCC 
subgroups, including notably a subgroup comprised of NSD1 or H3K36M mutations 
(labeled the H3K36 cluster). The H3K36 cluster is enriched in HPV-, TP53 mutant, heavy 
smoking patients. Those tumors are found in the larynx and oral cavity. Another HPV+/
TP53 wild-type subgroup is apparent (labeled the HPV+ cluster) as well as 3 other 
subgroups (labeled Groups A, B and C). Grey and white bars for clinical variables (HPV 
status, anatomical location) denote “No hit” or “Not available”, respectively.

Tumors with H3K36M were mainly located in the oral cavity while NSD1 mutant tumors 
mainly occurred in the larynx and less frequently in other known locations of HNSCCs. The 
size of the dotted lines is proportional to the frequency of the mutation in a given anatomical

 Figure 3. Representative immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of H3K36M, NSD1, H3K36me2 
and H3K36me3 in H3K36M or NSD1 mutant HNSCCs and in a HNSCC sample wild-type for 
these genes
Representative IHC of HNSCC samples using anti-H3K36M, anti-NSD1, anti-H3K36me3, 
or anti-H3K36me2 antibodies and counterstained with hematoxylin. H3K36M was 
expressed in 3/85 HPV-HNSCCs. H3K36M shows strong nuclear positivity in tumor cells 
but no staining in adjacent nuclei of stromal/inflammatory cells. Tumors wild-type for 
H3K36M and/or NSD1 show no nuclear staining with the anti-H3K36M antibody. 
Corresponding H3K36me3 and H3K36me2 staining on the same samples shows global 
decrease in the levels of these histone marks in H3K36M mutant tumors compared to tumors 
wild-type for this mutation. Notably, strong positivity for H3K36me3 and H3K36me2 was 
seen in the adjacent stromal cells not carrying H3K36M mutation, while uniform strong 
staining in tumor and stroma was observed for both marks in HNSCCs wild-type for 
H3K36M. Loss of NSD1 was associated with a marked decrease in global levels of 
H3K36me2 but not in H3K36me3. Pictures were taken under a 40X magnification and 
collated using Photoshop.
