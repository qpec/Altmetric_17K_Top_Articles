Rapid eye movement sleep (REMS) is a peculiar brain state combining the behavioral
components of sleep and the electrophysiological profiles of wake. After decades of research
our understanding of REMS still is precluded by the difficulty to observe its spontaneous
dynamics and the lack of multimodal recording approaches to build comprehensive datasets.
We used functional ultrasound (fUS) imaging concurrently with extracellular recordings of
local field potentials (LFP) to reveal brain-wide spatiotemporal hemodynamics of single REMS
episodes. We demonstrate for the first time the close association between global hyperemic
events – largely outmatching wake levels in most brain regions – and local hippocampal theta
(6–10 Hz) and fast gamma (80–110 Hz) events in the CA1 region. In particular, the power of
fast gamma oscillations strongly correlated with the amplitude of subsequent vascular
events. Our findings challenge our current understanding of neurovascular coupling and
question the evolutionary benefit of such energy-demanding patterns in REMS function.

 T
he memory function and physiological mechanisms of
sleep in animal models have been highlighted over the last
decade by techniques that enable the selective suppression
and manipulation of brain oscillations1,2, event-triggered ima-
ging3 and the activation of targeted neuronal ensembles4. In
particular, previous work on hippocampal replay in rodents have
established that sharp-wave ripples support memory consolida-
tion processes by facilitating the transfer of newly formed
memory traces in the hippocampus towards stable cortical sites
during sleep5,6 and that they are critical for spatial learning
during the awake state7. Most of these breakthroughs have
focused on hippocampal recordings during slow-wave sleep
(SWS), leaving rapid-eye-movement sleep (REMS) comparatively
understudied and confining its putative role to dreaming and
emotional processing8. However, recent evidence shows that
REMS plays a major role in hippocampal plasticity9, that theta
oscillations are critical for hippocampus-dependent memory
consolidation in mice10 and that REMS allows selective pruning
and consolidation of newly formed synapses throughout devel-
opment and learning11. These new findings strongly question the
functional dissociation between selective processes occurring
during SWS and REMS.
REMS is a peculiar brain state characterized by wake-like
electrophysiological patterns accompanied by the behavioral
components of sleep12,13. The neurophysiology of REMS includes
prominent features that strongly differ from wake such as high
cholinergic tone in the cortex, muscle paralysis, irregular heart
rate, irregular breathing, rapid-eye movements, and penile
erection14,15. However, it has been very challenging to differ-
entiate between wake and REMS based solely on local field
potentials (LFP) and without monitoring the discharge patterns
of principal neurons16, which has prompted the need for multi-
modal recording approaches to build a comprehensive model
of REMS. As with SWS, REMS is not divided into stages but
rather described in terms of a tonic component (including
high arousal threshold, low-amplitude synchronized electro-
encephalogram (EEG), and muscle atonia) that is interleaved
with phasic events (including bursts of oculomotor activity,
irregular breathing and prominent electrographic events such as
ponto-geniculo-occipital waves, theta, and gamma bursts)17–20.
Due to the transient nature of REMS and to the significant
caveats associated with actual recording techniques, a simulta-
neous monitoring of electrographic and vascular events during
spontaneous sleep has been very hard to achieve. This results in
an important lack of data regarding the activity of distributed
networks during REMS and a poor understanding of the phy-
siological function of its phasic events. Previous studies have
reported that REMS is associated with increased cerebral blood
flow in cats21, surges in heart rate and arterial pressure in rats22,
and functional microstates in humans23,24. Importantly, rich
oscillatory content precedes vascular events, suggesting that they
may act in inter-area communication to synchronize distributed
networks18. However, both the physiological function of REMS
and its phasic/tonic components remain elusive.
This study imaged brain activity during natural REMS in rats
using a combination of electrophysiology and fUS imaging25. This
novel neuroimaging modality based on ultrafast ultrasound ima-
ging26 provides new insights into brain dynamics thanks to com-
prehensive imaging of hemodynamics in conjunction with local
recordings of electrographic activity. In contrast with EEG-
functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), which entails
habituation, care with electrode design and sleep deprivation pro-
tocols, fUS-EEG appeared particularly well-suited for animal sleep
studies because it unveiled the vascular correlates of selective brain
rhythms over large distributed networks including deep structures
and whole-brain hemodynamics at the sub-second scale27.
We report imaging of brain-wide vascular hyperactivity specific
to REMS in rats that previously performed a track-running task.
We show that vascular activity also divides into tonic and phasic
regimes, the latter exhibiting transient brain-wide hyperemic
patterns, which we called vascular surges (VS). VS amplitude was
strongest in the dorsal hippocampus and outmatched wake levels
in nearly all brain regions, occasionally reaching up to a 100%
increase in the cortical and hippocampal regions compared to
a quiet wake state. We isolated precursors to VS in the theta
(6–10 Hz) and high-gamma (70–110 Hz) bands of hippocampal
LFP, and the intensity of each individual VS was best accounted
for by the power of fast gamma, suggesting a strong association
between local electrographic events and massive brain-wide vas-
cular patterns.
Results
REMS is characterized by massive brain-wide hyperemia. Using
a traditional sleep scoring procedure based on movement detec-
tion (video tracking and accelerometer), neck electromyogram
(EMG) and intra-hippocampal local field potentials (LFP),
we were able to distinguish between four different states: quiet
wake (QW), active wake (AW), non-REM sleep (NREMS), and
REM sleep (REMS) [Fig. 1a]. Although the LFP patterns were
strongly similar between AW and REM, as characterized by
prominent peaks in the theta (6–10 Hz) and high-gamma
(100–150 Hz) bands, low ripple content and high theta/delta
ratio28 [Supplementary Fig. 1], we found that cerebral blood
volume (CBV) profiles strongly differ between these two states,
whereas QW and NREMS showed relatively low CBV levels
(bottom black line, Fig. 1a). REMS was characterized by elevated
CBV levels for the whole duration of the REM episode in all
recorded brain regions (more moderately in ventral thalamus
and hypothalamus) compared with a baseline in the first 3 min of
QW in each recording. This vascular activity during REMS
fluctuated between moderate CBV levels matching AW levels
(REM-TONIC) and massive CBV spikes (REM-PHASIC), which
we called vascular surges (VS, red shaded boxes, Fig. 1b) and were
present in nearly all brain regions but more prominent and
stronger in all sub-regions of the dorsal hippocampus [Fig. 1b].
Thorough inter-individual analysis of VS amplitude across brain
regions is provided later in the paper. These VS events, which we
detected using a population activity threshold [Supplementary
Fig. 2], typically lasted 5 to 30 s but could extend to over a minute
in cortical regions. Typical transitions between NREMS and
REMS episodes are shown in supplementary content in three
animals over three different recording planes [Supplementary
Movies 1–3].
We investigated whether the profile of the VS events was
similar among animals. We analyzed from five animals for
which we could reliably perform statistics (two animals were
excluded because we could record <5 VS events overall) and
computed the number of VS events, their duration, intensity,
and activity ratio [Table 1]. The intensity of a given VS event
was simply computed by spatially averaging the CBV signal in
all brain voxels. The activity ratio is the proportion of ‘‘active
pixels’’ as defined previously [Supplementary Fig. 2] to detect
the VS events. From these temporal variables we could extract
a mean and maximum value for each VS event. The profile
of VS events was remarkably constant over all five animals
(around four to six VS events per REM episode) and though
the duration of VS events displayed high variability this was
observed in four out of five animals. On the other hand, the
intensity was roughly constant (from 23.2 to 34.8%) and activity
ratio of VS events was very well preserved across animals
(from 59.9 to 65.0%).

 REMS hyperemic events are strongest in the dorsal hippo-
campus. We quantified these different vascular regimes across
brain regions and individuals using an MRI-based atlas-regis-
tration algorithm [Supplementary Fig. 3]. As expected, QW and
NREM vascular regimes were relatively similar to baseline, except
in the thalamus, which was hypoactive during NREM (Cohen’s
d = −0.24, p < 10−3, two-tailed Mann–Whitney test). AW was
significantly higher than QW (Cohen’s d = 1.06, p < 10−3, two-
tailed Mann–Whitney test), especially in the cortical regions,
while REM (and REM-phasic) strongly outmatched baseline
levels, doing so more strongly in hippocampal regions (Cohen’s
d = 1.77 and 3.87, p < 10−3, two-tailed Mann–Whitney test)
[Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 4]. To demonstrate that the CBV
differences observed here are not spuriously arising from inter-
individual averaging, we computed confidence intervals for each
behavioral state for each of the five animals for which we could
reliably perform averaging [Table 2]. This analysis confirmed that
dorsal hippocampus and dorsal thalamus were strongly activated
during REMS in all animals (Dorsal Hippocampus: from 19.46 to
29.21%; Dorsal Thalamus: from 17.23 to 24.11%; Cortex: from
10.02 to 20.78%), that this effect was even stronger during REM-
PHASIC periods (Dorsal Hippocampus: from 39.99 to 49.78 %;

scoring is performed by using neck electromyogram (EMG), head acceleration (ACC), and hippocampal local field potential (LFP) to discriminate between
quiet wake (QW), active wake (AW), non-REM sleep (NREMS), and REM sleep (REMS). REMS periods are characterized by high theta/delta ratio, low

 Dorsal Thalamus: from 37.91 to 47.81%; Cortex: from 17.24 to
37.47%) and that confidence intervals of CBV activation across
sleep states were remarkably consistent across animals. We then
assessed functional connectivity across states and found the same
patterns for NREM and AW, consisting of a co-active cortex,
thalamus and hippocampus, whereas functional coupling across
regions
was

(QW: Rpear_mean = .76, std = .11; NREM: Rpear_mean = .73,
std = .07;
AW:

std = .11;
REM:
Rpear_mean = .93, std = .04) [Fig. 2b]. Likewise, we computed
confidence intervals for the analysis of the ratios of increases in
functional coupling, for four animals across coronal planes. We
found stronger inter-individual variability especially between
AW-QW functional coupling, but all animals displayed stronger
cortex-hippocampus,
thalamus-cortex,
and
hippocampus-
thalamic coupling during REMS than any other sleep and wake
state, confirming the fact that functional coupling between distant
brain areas increases during REMS [Supplementary Table 1].
Overall, AW/QW amplification resulted in a 6.0% increase, while
REM/QW reached a 15.9% increase in the hippocampus; this
level increased to 31.9% when considering phasic REM epochs
[Fig. 2c and Supplementary Tables 2–3]. Not all regions show the
same amplification ratio between the AW, REM and REM-phasic
epochs, the strongest being observed in the dorsal hippocampus,
dorsal thalamus, and retrosplenial cortex. These results show that
REMS is a state of vascular hypersynchrony that is characterized
by phasic massive spikes in CBV levels and is strongest in hip-
pocampal regions.
Band-specific Hippocampal LFP bursts precede vascular sur-
ges. We found robust LFP precursors to VS in the form of a theta
(6–10 Hz) power increase and acceleration accompanied by mid
(50–100 Hz) and fast gamma bursts (100–150 Hz) [Fig. 3a, b].
Such phasic electrographic events have been described previously
in rodents and cats, where they are thought to transiently syn-
chronize hippocampal networks18,19 and were observed preced-
ing the vast majority of the VS events in all brain regions.
Furthermore, we isolated the peak amplitude of each electro-
graphic burst that we compared to its vascular counterpart. We
found that vascular amplitude strongly correlated with LFP power
in the mid (50–100 Hz) (r = 0.771, t-student = 20.5, p < 10−3)
and high (100–150 Hz) gamma (r = 0.788, t-student = 21.8, p <
10−3) bands, but only moderately in the theta band (r = 0.321, t-
student = 8.63, p < 10−3) and not at all in the low-gamma (20–50
Hz) band (r = 0.025, t-student = 0.58, n.s.) [Fig. 3c]. We gen-
eralized this approach by thoroughly searching each band of the
LFP between 1 and 250 Hz, yielding similar results and showing a
prominent peak in the 80–110 Hz band [Fig. 3d and Supple-
mentary Fig. 5]. The analysis of the delays between LFP gamma
bursts and CBV events relative to the peak of theta, revealed
that gamma power was stronger in the second half of each theta
burst (low-gamma: Δt1 = 300 ms; mid-gamma: Δt2 = 340 ms;
high-gamma:
Δt3 = 280 ms),
and
that
thalamic
regions
(Δt4 = 1303 ms, sem = 3.35 ms, Z-score = 21.1, p < 10−3) peaked
before hippocampal (Δt5 = 1458 ms, sem = 3.37 ms, Z-score =
22.7, p < 10−3) and cortical regions (Δt6 = 1493 ms, sem = 3.60 s,
Z-score = 22.0, p < 10−3) [Supplementary Table 4], revealing a
sequential activation associated with gamma bursts [Fig. 3e and
Supplementary Fig. 6]. Altogether, these results finely characterize
the spatiotemporal hemodynamics associated with fast gamma
oscillations during phasic REMS.
We investigated the co-occurrence of LFP oscillations and
vascular activation in deeper details, first to confirm which LFP
band best described the fluctuations observed in the regional CBV
signal but also to investigate the frequency of occurrence of the
LFP burst activity preceding each VS event [Fig. 4]. We used two
complementary approaches, first by detecting VS in each of the
three
main
regions
(thalamus,
hippocampus,
cortex)
and
searching for LFP events in the timing window [−4.0 s; + 1.0 s]
preceding the CBV peak. We found strongest co-occurrences
(over 75% in the mid and fast gamma bands for all three regions)
with highest coupling in the hippocampus (Low-Gamma: 368/
611; Mid-Gamma: 441/611; High-Gamma: 458/611; Theta: 428/
611). The second approach consisted in detecting LFP burst
events and searching for CBV peaks in the timing window
following electrical activity. This yielded similar results, albeit
with weaker co-occurrence ratios (between 65 and 70% for all
three main regions) showing a weak tendency for LFP activity to
occur more often preceding VS events than for CBV activity to
follow electrical activation.
Fast gamma events lead vascular activity by 1.5 to 2 s. In order
to relate our data to previous work showing that fluctuations in
gamma power trigger an increase in arteriole diameter in 2 s and
changes in oxygenation in 3 s in awake head-fixed mice29, we
performed cross-correlations analysis between the LFP envelopes
and the regional CBV averages in all three main regions [Fig. 5].
Importantly, this analysis is somewhat different from the LFP-
CBV peak co-occurrence analysis performed previously as it does
not consider individual neural and vascular events, but computes
a cross-correlation function for each REM episode individually
thus providing a more robust measure of neurovascular interac-
tions, by smoothing out the effects of individual events. We
computed the cross-correlations between four LFP bands (Low-
Gamma, Mid-Gamma, High-Gamma, Theta) and three regional
CBV signals (Cortex, Thalamus, Hippocampus) for 28 recording
episodes over seven animals and displayed individual cross-
correlation functions for all resulting pairs [Fig. 5a]. We found

For each animal we display the number of vascular surges and REM episodes and counted the mean and standard-deviation of five parameters including: duration of VS, mean and maximum surge
intensity (in % CBV), mean and maximum active pixels ratio (in % of active pixels). The surge intensity is computed by averaging the CBV over all brain pixels for the whole VS duration. The activity ratio
is computed by counting the number of active pixels (that is the number of pixels that cross the activity threshold as defined in Supplementary Fig. 2 and Methods). Although VS events show
some intrinsic variability (in terms of duration for instance), these five parameters are very consistent across animals. We excluded two animals for which the total number of VS events was too low
(lower than 5)

 peaks in the positive LFP-CBV delay timing window moderately
for the theta band and very robustly for the mid and high-gamma
bands with LFP leading CBV response by a delay in a time
interval varying between 1 to 3 s. Low-Gamma showed highly
variable cross-correlation profile. We extracted a mean cross-
correlation profile to compute an average LFP-CBV delay for all
12 pairs [Fig. 5b]. As expected this showed a strong neurovascular
coupling in the mid and fast gamma bands, with mean cross-
correlations maxima between 0.6 and 0.7 for all three main
regions (Thalamus: Rmean = 0.64 obtained at lag = 1.35 s; Hip-
pocampus: Rmean = 0.69 obtained at lag = 1.52 s; Hippocampus:
Rmean = 0.64 obtained at lag = 1.65 s relatively to high-gamma
oscillations). Finally, we display the histogram count of the LFP-
CBV delays for all three main regions and cortex relatively to
high-gamma oscillations [Fig. 5c]. This confirmed that neuro-
vascular coupling is faster in the thalamic regions and slower in
the cortical regions compared to the hippocampus. Although the
mean delays (around 1.5 s) we found were somewhat shorter than

ences (species, head-fixed vs. head-free) and arousal state (sleep
vs. wakefulness). Importantly, we monitored the increases in
fractional cerebral blood volume occurring in arterioles but
excluding parenchyma capillaries where neurovascular interac-
tions can be triggered first30. This study confirms that vascular
activations in medium to large vessels trail fast gamma oscilla-
tions during spontaneous sleep by similar delays as what was
observed previously.
Discussion
Our findings bring new information about vascular activity levels
and dynamics across sleep stages and during REMS episodes in
particular. Several models of REMS function have been proposed
including the replay of extended place cell sequences31, improv-
ing creativity32, or unlearning irrelevant memories33. Our find-
ings of high levels of vascular activity, tightly coupled to fast
gamma oscillations and distributed on a large scale may help
refine these models. We observed massive brain-wide amplifica-
tion during REMS compared to active states such as running.
To the best of our knowledge, such activations have surprisingly
not yet been detected nor reported over the past 50 years, other
than using autoradiography21, a technique requiring sacrifice
and later criticized by one of its originators34. Several reasons
may explain this: first, physiological whole-brain data, especially
in deep structures, is difficult to obtain by direct techniques
without anesthesia. Secondly, the lack of sensitivity in fMRI/PET
studies,
the
difficulty
of
reliably
performing
EEG-fMRI
paradigms, device noise and intrinsic caveats associated with
sleep deprivation protocols represent a bottleneck for such animal
sleep studies. Thirdly, sleep research has focused on NREMS due
to the importance of sharp-wave/ripples and place cell coding
(which gives a physical correlate of neuronal activity), leaving
place cell recording during REMS scarce31. Last, the rarity of
REMS episodes in rodents and the fact that REMS episodes are
more frequent and longer at the end of the night in human sleep
is a challenge in multimodal imaging.
We have also demonstrated a robust association between fast
gamma oscillations and whole-brain vascular hyperactivity, which
was also observed under anesthesia in previous EEG-fMRI and
intrinsic optical signal (IOS)-fMRI studies35,36. The fast gamma
oscillations we observed are significantly faster than those
observed in cats, monkeys, or humans, but have previously been
described in rodents37. We investigated the coupling pattern
between theta phase and gamma power by computing the mean
power of gamma envelope relative to theta phase and found that
gamma power was strongly modulated by theta phase both
during REMs and AW [Supplementary Fig. 1]. During REMS,
mid and fast gamma peaked earlier (in the [90°–180°] range
relative to theta trough, or ascending theta phase) than slow
gamma oscillations (in the [180°–270°] range relative to theta
trough, or descending theta phase). Based on this observation, we
assume the mid-gamma oscillations we observed to be triggered
by direct entorhinal input to the CA1 region, as opposed to slow
gamma (30–50 Hz) putatively triggered by CA3 input18,37,38. This
opens the door to the pharmacological inhibition and optogenetic
manipulation of such oscillations for investigations into the global
effects of neurovascular coupling. Moreover, this challenges the

The analysis is performed for five brain regions: cortex, dorsal Hippocampus (dHpc), dorsal Thalamus (dThal), Whole Thalamus (Thal), and Whole-brain (Whole). For each brain region, one row
represents a single animal (the corresponding number of recordings is given between brackets) and a set of four columns corresponds to a single sleep state. For each sleep state, the left (bold) number
is the mean CBV level, the second and third figures are the 95% confidence interval and the last value is the corresponding p-value for the observed sleep state to be drawn from the QW distribution.
CBV levels are expressed in % of change relative to a baseline (3 first minutes of QW)

 notion that fast oscillations are a proxy for local information
processing, suggesting instead that they trigger activation over
largely distributed neural networks, possibly through neurovas-
cular interactions involving calcium spikes.
Although we did not question their function, we hint that the
spatiotemporal dynamics of these vascular surges are somewhat
related with the neural replay of previous experience, in our case,
a running task on a 2.4-m linear track. Firstly, theta and gamma
bursts observed during phasic REM periods are the same duration
and amplitude as the theta and gamma bursts observed when
these animals were actually running, which is consistent with
previous observations by Montgomery and colleagues18. Sec-
ondly, the vascular patterns observed during REMS involved the
same highly responsive regions in a similar dynamic sequence
(sequential activation of dorsal thalamus, dorsal hippocampus,
and cortex) as observed and described during active running on
a similar track27. Thirdly, based on recent studies identifying
high-frequency oscillations as the neural correlates of dreaming in
humans39, it is possible that fast gamma oscillations and sub-
sequent vascular surges, functionally coupled during REMS, are
involved in the generation of dream content in animals. Taken
together, these elements suggest a potential link in our experi-
mental configuration between REMS, VS, and the replay of past
experience. The combined fUS-EEG method is a unique tool to
answer this question and investigate the brain dynamics of other
complex behaviors such as conditioning, learning or dreaming.

Fig. 3 Hippocampal theta and fast gamma bursts precede vascular surges. a CA1 Hippocampal LFP trace (top) time-frequency spectrograms with four LFP
envelopes (middle) and regional CBV dynamics (bottom) for a typical REM sleep episode. Solid circles mark the regional peaks for LFP and CBV signals.
Note that each vascular surge (gray box) is preceded by sustained activity in the theta, mid-gamma, and high-gamma bands. Note that we can pair up LFP
peaks (brown/black dots) with corresponding vascular peaks (color dots) to investigate LFP-CBV coupling. Scale bar: 30 s. b Typical LFP precursor to a
vascular surge (extended box shown in a). At the onset of the VS, CA1 hippocampal LFP shows prominent theta and fast gamma bursts, occurring on the
ascending phase/peak of the theta cycle (gray curve). Upper scale bar: 100 ms. Lower scale bar: 5 s. c Scatter plot showing the correspondence between
LFP peaks (x-axis) corresponding CBV peak (y-axis), for the four frequency bands shown in a. Note the strong correlations in the mid (50–100 Hz) and high
(100–150 Hz) gamma bands, showing that hippocampal gamma predicts the amplitude of vascular amplification. The numbers in bracket specify the
pairing ratio between LFP and CBV peaks. d Exhaustive analysis of LFP-CBV correlations for all brain regions and LFP frequency bands. Horizontal axis: LFP
bands, Vertical axis: regional CBV variables. Each coefficient of matrices is obtained by generalizing the approach in c. Note that highest correlations are
obtained for gamma-mid band (50–100 Hz) in the hippocampal (DG-CA1-CA3) and dorsal thalamic (dThal) regions. e Histograms of delays for the three
LFP gamma sub-bands and the three CBV regions, relative to theta peaks. Note that cortical delays (m = 1.493 s) are longer than thalamic (m = 1.303 s)
and hippocampal (m = 1.458 s) delays

 Extrapolation of our results to human physiology should be
done cautiously. Human sleep structure differs strongly from that
of rodents. It is unclear whether such high-amplitude vascular
events exist in humans, although BOLD-based connectivity pat-
terns spread brain-wide during REMS24 and newborn sleep dis-
play high-amplitude vascular activity during early active sleep40.
At the experimental level, the current difficulties (absorption by
the bone, lack of sensitivity) to transfer functional ultrasound
imaging to healthy adult human subjects is an obstacle to
investigate brain-wide human sleep dynamics and will require
alternative strategies such as the use of contrast agents or aber-
ration correction41. Our current design also suffers some limita-
tions as it relies on power Doppler to estimate relative cerebral
blood volume. In our current set-up, and contrary to earlier
implementations of fUS that measured the fraction of CBV
flowing with an axial velocity higher than 4 mms−1 (refs. 26,42),

Fig. 4 Co-occurrence analysis of LFP and CBV activation peaks. a We first detected peaks for each of the four regional CBV averages (cortex, hippocampus,
thalamus, and whole). For each detected peak, we searched for peaks in the seven LFP envelope signals (Low-Gamma, Mid-Gamma, Upper Mid-Gamma,
High-Gamma, Upper High-Gamma, Ripple, and Theta) in the timing window [−4.0 s, +1.0 s] preceding the CBV peak. If more than one peak was found,
the closest was selected. The bar graphs display the proportion of LFP peaks found for each LFP-CBV signal pair (absolute number are given on top of each
bar). For all regions, the highest LFP-CBV co-occurrence ratio is found in the high-gamma band. b We performed the complementary approach by
detecting LFP peaks and searching the timing window [−1.0 s, +4.0 s] following LFP peak. The highest LFP-CBV co-occurrence ratio is found in the
hippocampus no matter the LFP band. Analysis performed for n = 7 animals overs 28 recordings. The corresponding LFP-CBV correlations and delay

 ultrafast Doppler combined with the use of SVD spatiotemporal
filter enables to reach a detection limit down to 1 mms−143. This
corresponds to speed in venules and arterioles but may exclude
capillaries where numerous neurovascular processes occur44.
Moreover, power Doppler is essentially blind to blood vessels
whose direction is quasi parallel to the transducer array
(+/−15°), which thus do not contribute to the measured CBV.
Ultimately, the amplitude and spatial extent of the massive
hemodynamic patterns unveiled by fUS imaging both confirm
that REMS is a very intense brain state— with an apparently
higher homeostatic point than wake—but also fundamentally
questions the putative function of REMS. These vascular patterns
suggest that the underlying mechanisms are energetically costly in
terms of neurovascular regulation and thus must have been
preserved only due to a significant evolutionary benefit, yet to be
determined.
Methods
Animal surgery. All animals received humane care in compliance with the Eur-
opean Communities Council Directive of 2010 (2010/63/EU), and the institutional
and regional committees for animal care approved the study. Adult Sprague
Dawley rats aged 10–12 weeks underwent surgical craniotomy and implant of an
ultrasound-clear prosthesis. Anesthesia was induced with 2% isoflurane and
maintained with ketamine/xylazine (80/10 mg kg–1), while body temperature was
maintained at 36.5 °C with a heating blanket (Bioseb, France). A sagittal skin
incision was performed across the posterior part of the head to expose the skull.
We excised the parietal and frontal flaps by drilling and gently moving the bone
away from the dura mater. The opening exposed the brain between the olfactory
bulb and the cerebellum, from bregma + 6.0 to bregma −8.0 mm, with a maximal
width of 14 mm. Electrodes were implanted stereotaxically and anchored on the
edge of the flap. A prosthetic skull was sealed in place with acrylic resin (GC
Unifast TRAD), and the residual space was filled with saline. We chose a prosthesis
approach that offers a larger field of view and prolonged imaging condition over
4–6 weeks compared to the thinned bone approach45. The prosthetic skull is
composed of polymethylpentene (Goodfellow, Huntington UK, goodfellow.com), a
standard biopolymer used for implants. This material has tissue-like acoustic
impedance that allows undistorted propagation of ultrasound waves at the acoustic
gel-prosthesis and prosthesis-saline interfaces. The prosthesis was cut out of a film
of 250 µm thickness and permanently sealed to the skull. Particular care was taken
not to tear the dura to prevent cerebral damage. The surgical procedure, including
electrode implantation, typically took 4–6 h. Animals recovered quickly and were
used for data acquisition after a conservative 1-week resting period.
Electrode design and implantation. Electrodes are based on linear polytrodes
made of bundles of insulated tungsten wires. The difference with a standard design
is a 90°-angle elbow that is formed prior to insertion in the brain27. This shape
enabled anchoring of the electrodes on the skull anterior or posterior to the flap.
Electrodes were implanted with stereotaxic positioning micromotion and anchored
one after another. The prosthesis was then applied to seal the skull. Two epidural
screws placed above the cerebellum were used as a reference and ground. Intra-
hippocampal handmade electrode bundles were composed of 25 to 50 µm insulated
tungsten wire soldered to miniature connectors. Four to six conductive ends were
spaced 1 mm apart and glued to form 3-mm-long, 100–150-µm-diameter bundles.
The bundles were lowered in the dorsal hippocampi at stereotaxic coordinates
AP = −4.0 mm, ML = + /− 2.5 mm and DV = −1.5 mm to −4.5 mm relative to
the Bregma.
LFP acquisition. LFP signals were collected from video-EEG device for offline
processing. Intracranial electrode signals were fed through a high input impedance,
DC-cut at 1 Hz, gain of 1000, 16-channel amplifier, and digitized at 20 kHz (Xcell,
Dipsi, Cancale, France), together with a synchronization signal from the ultrasound
scanner. Custom-made software based on LabVIEW (National Instruments, Aus-
tin, TX, USA) simultaneously acquired video from a camera pointed at the
recording stage. A regular amplifier was used, and no additional electronic circuit
for artifact suppression was necessary. A large bandwidth amplifier was used,
which can record local field potentials in all physiological bands (LFP, 0.1–2 kHz).
The spatial resolution of LFPs ranges from 250 µm to a few mm radius.
Ultrasound acquisition. Vascular images were obtained via the ultrafast com-
pound Doppler imaging technique26. The probe was driven by a fully program-
mable GPU-based ultrafast ultrasound scanner (Aixplorer, Supersonic Imagine,
Aix-en-Provence, France) relying on 24-Gb RAM memory. We acquired 400
ultrasound images at a 1 kHz frame rate for 200 ms, repeating every 1.0 s to 3.0 s.
Each frame is a compound plane-wave frame, that is, a coherent summation of
beamformed complex in phase/quadrature images obtained from the insonification
of the medium with a set of successive plane waves with specific tilting angles46.
This compound plane-wave imaging technique enabled the recreation of a dynamic
transmit focusing at all depths a posteriori in the entire field of view with few
ultrasound emissions. Given the tradeoff between frame rate, resolution and
imaging speed, a plane-wave compounding using five 5°-apart angles of insonifi-
cation (from −10° to + 10°) was chosen. As a result, the pulse repetition frequency
of the plane-wave transmissions was equal to 500 Hz. To discriminate blood signals
from tissue clutter, the ultrafast compound Doppler frame stack was filtered,
removing the N = 60 first components of the singular value decomposition, which
optimally exploited the spatiotemporal dynamics of the full Doppler film for clutter
rejection, largely outperforming conventional clutter-rejection filters used in
Doppler ultrasound47.
Recording sessions. Recording sessions were performed during continuous per-
iods of 40–60 min that followed a basic track-running task. The task consisted of
running along a 2.25-m-long linear track for water reward on both ends. The rats
were placed under a controlled water restriction protocol (weight maintained
between 85 and 90% of the normal weight) and trained before surgery to run back
and forth on a linear track for water reinforcement. The track (225 × 20 cm) had 5-
cm-high lateral walls and was placed 50 cm above the ground. Drops of water were
delivered through two small tubes coming from the two end walls of the track. Each
time the animal crossed the middle of the track, a single drop of water was
delivered in alternate water tubes by opening an electronically controlled pair of
solenoid valves. Daily training lasted 30 min. At the start of each recording session,
to attach the ultrasound probe and connect the EEG, the rats underwent brief
anesthesia for 20–25 min with 2% isoflurane. Acoustic gel was applied on the skull
prosthesis, and the probe was inserted into the probe holder. The gel did not dry
out even for extended recordings of up to 6–8 h. The animals were allowed to
recover for 40 min before starting the recording session. A typical session included
a 30–40 min running period and 1-h sleep for a total duration of approximately 3
h. The post-task sleep sessions were initiated 10 min after the end of the running
task. In total, we recorded from seven animals over the coronal and diagonal planes
for a total of 35 running-sleep sessions; thus, 62 total REM episodes were obtained
(30 of which lasted more than 30 s).
LFP analysis. All analysis were performed in MATLAB. For each recording, the
position of each recording site on the probe tract (four recording sites per probe)
was identified by measuring its impedance while lowering the bundle in saline
solution (Na-Cl 0.9%) before implantation. Hippocampal theta and gamma
rhythms were confirmed by phase inversion across recording sites in successive
hippocampal layers, time-frequency decomposition, and phase-amplitude cross-
frequency coupling37,38. Although we cannot completely exclude potential con-
tamination of high-frequency LFP recordings by unit activity, we observed that fast
gamma oscillations displayed typical phase-amplitude coupling patterns for all
recordings robustly across animals. The size of our electrode diameters (25 to 50
microns) and the stability of our recordings throughout sessions decrease the
probability that fast gamma events arose from correlated spiking activity. We then
selected the putative CA1 and dentate gyrus recording sites based on theta-gamma
coupling patterns and computed a differential signal from these two traces for each
animal. EEG was first filtered in the LFP range (LFP, 0.1–2 kHz) and band-pass
filtered in typical frequency bands including delta (1–4 Hz), theta (6–10 Hz), low-
gamma (20–50 Hz), mid-gamma (50–100 Hz), high-gamma (100–150 Hz), and
ripple (150–250 Hz). This division has been thoroughly described and proven to be
functionally relevant for hippocampal electrographic recordings38. The power of
LFP oscillations was computed as the square of the raw signal integrated over a
sliding Gaussian kernel of a characteristic width of 500 milliseconds to extract its
envelope. We also computed time-frequency spectrograms between 1 and 150 Hz
using a typical wavelet-based approach (classical wavelet, center frequency 2 Hz,
window size 2 s). To account for the attenuation of high frequencies, we multiplied
each row of the spectrogram by the value of the corresponding frequency f. To
select the putative CA1 recording site, we computed the instantaneous theta phase
(taking 0° as a theta trough) using a Hilbert transform and derived theta phase
time-frequency spectrograms to exhibit phase-amplitude theta-gamma coupling
patterns. CA1 recording sites were identified when peak gamma power occurs at
the peak of the theta phase, corresponding to the CA1 stratum lacunosum-
moleculare37.
Sleep scoring. The sleep scoring procedure was based on traditional methods
using neck electromyogram, animal movement and LFP to discriminate between
wake, NREM sleep and REMS. Thanks to the three-dimensional (3D) accel-
erometer placed on the head of the animal, we could discriminate between quiet
wake (QW) and active wake (AW). Quiet wake was detected when the EMG was
high and the animal stood still with its head close to the ground. Active wake was
detected when the animal was either moving, walking, running or standing and
whisking in the air. When the EMG dropped below a threshold (variable across
recordings, set during offline processing) for more than 20 s, we labeled the sub-
sequent period sleep. NREM sleep is characterized by a large amplitude of irregular
activity (white noise distribution between 1 and 50 Hz on the time-frequency
spectrogram, high ripple activity, and low theta/delta ratio), whereas REMS is

 characterized by increased theta and gamma peaks, minimal EMG, and decreased
ripple power. Brief awakening robustly followed the REM episode, as shown in
Fig. 1.
Baseline evaluation and spatial averaging. fUS data have been shown to be
proportional to local CBV. Because it is not possible to derive absolute CBV levels,
we normalized ultrasound data. We performed voxel-wise normalization by
selecting a baseline period, which we chose to be the first 3 min of QW. If our
recording lasted more than 1 h, we included three more minutes, repeating this
process for each extra recording hour, to account for any potential drift. We
extracted the distribution for each voxel during this baseline period and computed
a mean value, leading to one value for each voxel of the image. To derive a signal
similar to ΔF/F, we subtracted the mean and divided by the mean for each voxel in
the film containing our power Doppler images. This allowed normalization and
rescaling of ultrasound data, yielding to an expression in terms of the percent of
variation relative to baseline. Each voxel was normalized independently before
performing spatial averaging. Our dataset consisted of Doppler films sampled at
different rates varying from 3 images s−1 to 1 image s−1. To homogenize it, we
resampled (linear interpolation for each voxel) Doppler films to achieve a frame
rate of 1 image s−1 for all recordings.
Atlas registration. To assess inter-individual variability and perform statistical
analysis, we segmented each two-dimensional (2D) recording plane into anato-
mical regions based on a 3D MRI-based whole-brain atlas, which provided labeling
for 52 brain regions48. To derive the functional regions in our ultrasound image, we
designed a customized registration algorithm, which projected our 2D ultrasound
plane onto a 3D volumetric dataset. In short, we manually pinpointed landmarks
on the ultrasound image including the outer cortex edges, inner cortex edges,
midline plane, and dentate gyri edges, which were prominent due to hippocampal
longitudinal arteries wrapping them. We defined nine parameters, including three
offset values, three scaling values, and three rotations (13 parameters for multiplane
registration), to identify a given plane unambiguously in the 3D Waxholm space.
We performed optimization using the simplex algorithm to minimize a global error
based on the position of our landmarks and the closest corresponding border in the
Waxholm space. Provided the algorithm did not start too far from the actual
position, it converged quickly and provided robust registration for any ultrasound
plane, including diagonal planes. This process allowed us to derive vascular activity
in 20 regions that were observed in two imaging planes intersecting the recording
electrode tracts (one coronal view at coordinates Bregma = – 4.0 mm and one
diagonal plane 45° relative to the sagittal plane to include the ventral and dorsal
hippocampus).
fUS correlation analysis. We investigated changes in functional connectivity
between anatomical regions by measuring pairwise correlated variations in regional
CBV signals. Correlation matrices for functional connectivity analysis were
obtained by isolating the frames corresponding to each behavioral state (wake,
slow-wave sleep, and REMS) and computing the zero-lag correlation between each
pair of functional regions. No Fisher transformation or filters were applied. Each
recording led to four connectivity matrices corresponding to each behavioral state,
and we computed a mean matrix by averaging each of these matrices across all
recordings (Fig. 2b). Statistical significance of the Pearson coefficient was assessed
using a Student table with n-2 degrees of freedom, n being equal to the number of
pairs used to calculate the Pearson coefficient.
LFP-CBV correlation analysis. To assess the association between LFP events and
CBV variables, we searched for correlations between each possible combination of
one LFP band-pass filtered signal and a given regional CBV variable. As neuro-
vascular processes are not instantaneous, we should consider possible delays
between electrographic and vascular signals. A first approach that we rejected here
was to directly compute lagged cross-correlations between two signals for any LFP-
CBV pair and any lag in a given time window. This was tedious and introduced
another variable (correlation lag), which made the overall analysis less clear.
Instead, we chose to isolate regional peaks in each LFP envelope signal and CBV
regional averages by detecting the zero-derivative (keep only the maxima by
looking at the sign of the second derivative). This process was performed for each
LFP and each CBV variable independently and yielded a series of timings (tpeak)
and values (vpeak). For each point in the timing series of CBV variables, we
searched a timing window of [tpeak – 4.0 s; tpeak + 1.0 s] for the presence of a peak
in the LFP signal. If a peak was found, we noted the delay between tpeak_CBV and
tpeak_LFP and paired up corresponding values [vpeak_CBV; vpeak_LFP]. If more
than one peak was found in this interval, which scarcely happened, we selected that
closest to the vascular peak. If no peak was found, we discarded the corresponding
CBV peak from the analysis but kept a record of the proportion of LFP peaks found
relative to the CBV peak. We then computed correlations for all recordings using
[vpeak_CBV; vpeak_LFP] pairs. To remove spurious effects due to inter-individual
averaging (for example, Yule-Simpson effects), we normalized vpeak_CBV and
vpeak_LFP time series between 0 and 1, corresponding respectively the minimal
and maximal value in each recording. This artificially increased the number of
border points. The timing analysis was performed to compare the mean of the LFP-
CBV delay distributions (where delay Δt = tpeak_CBV – tpeak_LFP) for each LFP
envelope signal. Statistical significance of the Pearson coefficient was assessed using
a Student’s table with n-2 degrees of freedom, n being equal to the number of pairs
used to calculate the Pearson coefficient.
Detection of phasic episodes. Vascular surges were detected by segregating each
voxel in each REMS frame of the Doppler video between active and inactive states.
A voxel was considered active when its value was higher than an activation
threshold, which we set as one standard-deviation above the mean of the active
wake distribution for this very pixel (Z-score > 1). This led to a threshold image for
each recording. To detect phasic vascular activity, we isolated time periods con-
taining more than 50% of brain voxels above this activation threshold. This
approach ensured that both sustained activity and the spatial extent were con-
sidered to discriminate between phasic and tonic vascular regimes. We also
excluded surges that lasted less than 5 s, which occurred scarcely.
Statistics. All statistics are given as + /− standard error of the mean unless stated
otherwise. Statistics in Fig. 2a are computed on n = 7 animals over 30 recording
sessions. Distributions and their mean values are compared using Cohen’s distance
relative to QW and the two-tailed Mann–Whitney test. Confidence intervals of
CBV levels in Table 2 are extracted by first computing and mean value of the
temporal series of CBV values for each 30 s time window (which results in
downsampling the CBV temporal series, in order to avoid artificially narrow
confidence intervals due to high temporal sampling rate). The CBV series are then
aggregated for each animal and confidence intervals are computed, with resulting
p-values obtained from Mann–Whitney test, when comparing to QW distribution.
Matrices shown in Fig. 2b are computed by averaging matrices from 17
recordings (coronal planes) on four animals. Confidence intervals for functional
coupling correlation coefficients are computed by applying Fisher transform for
each recording and computing the 95% confidence interval. This interval is then
averaged for all recordings in the same animal and displayed in Supplementary
Table 1. Corresponding Z-scores were computed to test the significance of the
difference between two Pearson coefficients R_A and R_B. We compute the ratio

, where Z_A and Z_B are the images of R_A and R_B by the Fischer
transform and sd is the cumulative variance of the series A and B (sd = sa2 + sb2).
Here, we tested for the difference of coupling between QW distribution and AW,
NREM, and REM distributions.
Bar diagrams shown in Fig. 2c are computed by averaging the mean values of 17
recordings on four animals for the coronal planes and 11 recordings in four
animals for the diagonal planes. Statistics are computed using a two-tailed
Mann–Whitney test. The significance of Pearson correlation coefficients shown in
Figs. 3 and 4c are assessed by computing the t-value (using ¼ r ffiffiffiffiffiffiffi

p
) and reporting
it in Student’s table with n–2 degrees of freedom. The histograms presented in
Fig. 3e were computed on n = 7 animals over 35 REM episodes, which lasted more
than 30 s. Statistical significance of the difference in delays was computed using
Student’s paired t-test between each pair of series of delays.
