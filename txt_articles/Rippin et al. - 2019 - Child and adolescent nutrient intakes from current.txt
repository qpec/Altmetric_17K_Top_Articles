Abstract
The WHO encourages national diet survey (NDS) implementation to obtain relevant data to inform policies addressing all forms of
malnutrition, which remains a pressing issue throughout Europe. This paper provides an up-to-date review on energy, macro- and selected
micronutrient intakes in children across WHO Europe using the latest available NDS intakes. It assesses these against WHO recommended
nutrient intakes (RNI) to highlight vulnerable groups and areas of concern. Dietary survey information was gathered by Internet searches,
contacting survey authors and nutrition experts. Survey characteristics, energy and nutrient intakes were extracted and weighted means
calculated and presented by region. Child energy and nutrient intakes were extracted from twenty-one NDS across a third (n 18) of the
fifty-three WHO Europe countries. Of these, 38 % (n 6) reported intakes by socio-economic group, but by various indicators. Energy and
macronutrients, where boys and older children had higher intakes, were more widely reported than micronutrients. Most countries met under
half of the WHO RNI for nutrients reported in their NDS. Micronutrient attainment was higher than macronutrients, but worst in girls and older
children. Only a third, mainly Western, WHO European member states provided published data on child nutrient intakes. Gaps in provision
mean that dietary inadequacies may go unidentified, preventing evidence-based policy formation. WHO RNI attainment was poor, particularly
in girls and older children. Inconsistent age groups, dietary methodologies, nutrient composition databases and under-reporting hinder inter-
country comparisons. Future efforts should encourage countries to conduct NDS in a standardised format by age and sociodemographic
variables.

Introduction
The burden of malnutrition in the form of overweight and
obesity, nutrient deficiency and preventable diet-related non-
communicable diseases (NCD) is significant and worsening
worldwide(1,2). In particular, unhealthy diet is one of the four
major behavioural risk factors for NCD in all WHO regions(3),
with the European region proportionately suffering the greatest
NCD burden. In Europe, the four most common NCD account
for 77 % of disease and almost 86 % premature mortality(1), and
overweight and obesity affect a third of children aged 11
years(4). Childhood obesity has negative health impacts and is
associated with educational underachievement, low self-esteem
and increased obesity risk in adulthood(5).
National diet surveys (NDS) have an important role in asses-
sing dietary patterns and intakes in the whole population and
informing relevant policy decisions; the WHO European Food
& Nutrition Action Plan(1) explicitly encourages member states
to ‘strengthen and expand nationally representative diet and
nutrition surveys’. However, NDS provision across Europe is
inconsistent. A recent review found that less than two-thirds
(thirty-four out of fifty-three) of WHO Europe countries have
nationally representative NDS, and that the majority of gaps
lie in Central and Eastern European countries (CEEC)(6). This
is concerning, as nutrition policies in these countries may
therefore lack an appropriate evidence base.
Novaković et al.(7) examined selected micronutrient intakes in
CEEC compared with other European countries and found that
CEEC lacked intake data across all ages, particularly in children.
The aforementioned recent review by Rippin et al.(6) showed that
under a third (seventeen out of fifty-three) of European countries
reported energy and nutrient intakes for children aged<18 years
from NDS conducted post-2000(6). This finding is not surprising,
as data of this kind are limited. The Global Dietary Database
houses information on food and nutrient consumption levels
before 2010 in countries globally, but has limited nutrient data,
includes some regional rather than national surveys and does not
currently cover children(8). Merten et al.(9) reviewed methodolo-
gical characteristics and heterogeneity in European NDS, but also

 included regional child surveys. However, the surveys were
limited to European Union member states, only included surveys
employing certain dietary assessment methods and did not dis-
cuss nutrient intakes.
Despite this lack of data, nutrition and health surveys remain
the main source of information on dietary risk factors. For
example, a systematic analysis of disease risk in twenty-one
regions worldwide between 1990 and 2010 was conducted
based on information collated from NDS(10). Such data are also
used to inform policy and identify food and nutrients of most
concern. For example, Volatier et al.(11) used NDS to compile a
reference list of indicator foods to be used for the validation of
nutrient profiling schemes – a policy tool to categorise foods
according to their nutritional composition to aid disease pre-
vention and health promotion. These examples demonstrate the
importance and range of use that NDS can have in monitoring
population diet quality and health, and gathering information
on which to base disease–risk prevention policies and address
childhood obesity. NDS can help monitor NCD risk factors and
malnutrition, identify specific areas of concern, highlight
inequalities and evaluate policy impact, thereby ultimately
contributing to the promotion of best practice for nutritional
health across the region(1).
A comprehensive, up-to-date review of total nutrient intakes
across different European child populations is therefore nee-
ded, which could identify where in Europe there is a need to
improve diets and whether inequalities exist. In a manner
consistent with that published for adults(12), the present review
aims to examine macro- and selected micronutrient intakes in
children across the WHO European region via the latest NDS for
which nutrient intake data are available, with reference to age-
appropriate WHO recommended nutrient intakes (RNI).
Methods
Identifying national diet surveys
The methods for identifying and accessing NDS have been
reported(6). Briefly, authors of national surveys within the WHO
European region were identified using listed contact names and
other information from two main reports of NDS(13,14). Where
no response was obtained from authors, further general Internet
searches were performed on organisations specialising in
nutrition to find other potentially useful contact details. Addi-
tionally, country responses to WHO Global Nutrition Policy
Review 2017 questionnaires were mined to obtain relevant
references. Contacts identified were asked to complete a
questionnaire to provide information on nationally representa-
tive dietary surveys conducted on adults or children at an
individual level since 1990, including links or references to
relevant reports. For countries without contact details, a sys-
tematic database search was performed across Web of Science,
MEDLINE and Scopus for nationally representative dietary
surveys of adults and children that collected data at an indivi-
dual level from 1990 to June 2016. Papers returned were
screened for relevance according to the criteria in Table 1.
We found 109(6) (and have subsequently added recent
releases to make 110) nationally representative surveys that
collected data on whole diets at an individual level since 1990
across thirty-four of the fifty-three countries in WHO Europe;
sixty-nine included children, of which forty-nine were con-
ducted since 2000. Further details of all surveys found are
presented in Rippin et al.(6).
Data extracted
Where available, estimated energy and nutrient intakes by sex
and age group were extracted from the latest NDS collected
after 2000. For NDS that provided results including and
excluding supplements, the latter was used; where not speci-
fied, it was assumed that intakes excluded supplements. For
children this was extracted from twenty-one surveys from
eighteen countries; the Netherlands had two and Ireland three
surveys, which covered different child age groups. Mean values
were reported in all cases except Dutch children aged 7–8
years, which used medians – these were extracted and used
instead. The eighteen countries were grouped into regions –
Western, Northern and Central and Eastern Europe. For some
countries (France, Latvia, the Netherlands and Spain), more
recent surveys had been conducted, but intake data were not
yet available. Energy intakes reported in kcal were converted to
MJ for consistency across studies. Appendix 1 and Appendix 2
list the availability of selected nutrients reported from the latest
surveys collected after 2000.
All macronutrients reported by the twenty-one surveys were
included in the data extraction (see Table 2), but micronutrients
extracted (see Table 3) were limited to those explicitly men-
tioned in the WHO European Food and Nutrition Action Plan(1)
as being currently important to population health in the
region. See Appendix 1 and Appendix 2 for all nutrient intakes
extracted.
WHO RNI were used to assess intake adequacy in the
population majority and highlight areas of concern in the
absence of raw NDS data from sufficient countries to determine
the prevalence of inadequacy in relation to the percentage of
the population below the estimated average requirements. The
exception was energy, where RNI changed in yearly incre-
ments, so were not sufficiently compatible with survey age
groupings(15–20). Additionally, WHO RNI for Fe are given for
different bioavailabilities, so UK Reference Nutrient Intakes

 (RNI) were used instead(21). UK RNI were also used for K and
Na, as WHO RNI recommend downweighting values based on
energy requirements for children relative to adults. The RNI for
MUFA is calculated by the difference between total fat and the
sum of SFA, PUFA and trans-fatty acids (TFA), so has not been
included. The WHO RNI for free sugars(19) has been adopted as
the RNI for added sugars, as no WHO RNI exists for added
sugars, yet the majority of surveys that reported sugars used the
added rather than free sugar definition. The added sugars
definition is similar but more restrictive to that of free sugars,
meaning that free sugar intake would not be overestimated.
Depending on the nutrient, RNI were variously maximum,
minimum or target amounts (see Tables 2 and 3).
Energy and selected nutrient intakes reported by age group
and sex in these latest surveys collected after 2000 were
graphed. To harmonise the data where possible, units of mea-
surement were converted to common standard units. Omega-3
(n-3) and omega-6 (n-6) fatty acids were reported variously in
surveys, including n-3, n-6, linoleic acid and α-linolenic acid in
g/d and percentage energy (%E) and EPA + DHA in mg/d.
These were converted to g and %E and grouped into n-3 and
n-6 fatty acids for clarity. ‘Added sugars’ is used as a proxy term
for sucrose, as the countries reporting this nutrient typically
referred to it as ‘added sugars’ or did not specify.
Additionally, estimated mean intakes by sex for two age
groups split roughly by those aged <10 years and ≥10 years (to
18 years) were determined for each country, and also for Eur-
opean regions and Europe overall. This cut-off was chosen
because 10 years was a common boundary for RNI split by age.
Age ranges for reported and extracted means that spanned the
10-year cut-off contained a larger proportion of ≥10-year-olds in
all cases, so were allocated to that group. This occurred in
seven countries (Cyprus, Ireland, Latvia, the Netherlands, Spain,
Turkey and the UK), where only Latvia included children
aged <9 years (7–16 years). The UK 4- to 10-year age group was
included in the <10 years group. Some countries did not
separate by sex in the youngest ages – in these instances the
same mean intake was used for both girls and boys. Where
mean intakes were reported by a country for more than one age
group <10 years, or more than one age group ≥10 years, the
numbers of children/adolescents surveyed in the NDS in each
age group were used to weight the reported means to produce
estimated mean intakes for those aged <10 years and ≥10 years.
For instance, mean intakes for Belgium were reported and
extracted for 3- to 5-year-olds, 6- to 9-year-olds, 10- to 13-year-
olds and 14- to 17-year-olds; the mean intake reported for boys
aged 3–5 years was multiplied by the number of boys surveyed
for that age group, and added to a similar calculation for the 6-
to 9-year-olds; the sum of these was then divided by the total
number of boys aged <10 years to produce an estimated mean
for <10 years for Belgium. Where countries had multiple NDS
(Ireland, the Netherlands), age ranges ran concurrently rather
than overlapping, so the NDS were grouped and used to esti-
mate the mean intakes for those aged <10 years and ≥10 years
as described above. The mean intakes for each European
region and Europe overall were estimated by multiplying
the <10 years or ≥10 years means for each country and sex by

 the national population aged <19 years for each country(22–24).
The resulting value for each country was summed and then
divided by the total sum of the national child populations in
each European region, then Europe as a whole. The same
population values were used for both the <10 years and ≥10
years groups, assuming similar population ratios. These popu-
lation weightings made the estimated means roughly gen-
eralisable to the European regions and Europe as a whole.
Characteristics of the twenty-one surveys were also extracted
and tabled; these were: country name, survey name, year of
survey (data collection), source, sample size, age range, dietary
methodology and the nutrient reference database underpinning
the survey. The number and percentage of WHO RNI not met
were recorded for the nutrients and sex/age groups for which
they were reported. Where reported, surveys presenting nutri-
ent intakes by socio-economic group based on social class,
income (continuous or grouped), occupation and education
level were also noted.
Results
Data extracted
The scope of NDS coverage across Europe has previously been
documented(6). Energy and nutrient intakes (excluding sup-
plements) for children aged ≤18 years were extracted from
twenty-one surveys across eighteen countries from three
regions: two of five Northern European countries (Denmark,
Norway); ten of seventeen Western European countries (Aus-
tria, Belgium, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, The Netherlands,
Portugal, Spain, UK) and six of thirty-one CEEC (Bulgaria,
Cyprus, Estonia, Latvia, Slovenia, Turkey). Table 4 shows the
characteristics of these surveys. Child energy and nutrient
intakes could not be extracted for 66 % (thirty-five) of European
countries for various reasons, from lack of availability to
incompatible age-group structure. Nineteen of these countries,
mainly CEEC, had no identifiable nationally representative
survey, making up over a third of WHO Europe countries. The
Andorran NDS surveyed children, but the lowest age group
(12–24 years) spanned adults and children, so intake data were
not included in the results or graphs.
All twenty-one NDS that reported nutrient intakes included
energy; however, Latvia reported no other macronutrients. The
majority (n 20) reported protein, carbohydrate and fat intakes
and most reported fibre intakes (n 19) (see Table 5). Most NDS
included intake data on saturated fats (n 19), and MUFA and
PUFA (n 18). However, less than half (n 7) NDS included TFA
intakes. Most NDS (n 16) included either total or added sugars/
sucrose; however, six NDS included neither. Just over half the
countries included either n-3 (n 7) or n-6 (n 7) fatty acid intakes
in some form; six NDS included both.
Micronutrients were less widely covered by the twenty-one
surveys – Spain reported no micronutrient intakes and Latvia
only included Na (see Table 6). Ca and Fe were reported by all
but two surveys (Latvia and Spain did not), whilst vitamins B12
and D were reported by all but three (Latvia, Spain and Cyprus
did not). Iodine was the least reported micronutrient, by just
over half (n 11) of the surveys.
Of the twenty-one surveys for which energy and nutrient
intakes were extracted, only 38 % (n 8) reported intakes by
socio-economic group in addition to age and sex (Estonia,
France, all three Irish surveys, Dutch National Food Con-
sumption Survey of young children, Norway, UK).
Energy and nutrient intakes
Means reported here are estimated weighted means for Europe
overall for children <10 years and ≥10 years (see Tables 5 and 6
for estimated means by energy and nutrients broken down by
country/survey); values in parentheses are ranges of sex and
age group means provided in the survey reports. Of the nine-
teen macro- and micronutrients considered, no country other
than Slovenia (44 %) met more than half of the WHO RNI in the
nutrients and age/sex groups for which they were reported.
Though patterns were evident across sex and age, there were
no apparent regional trends across Europe.
Energy. Although age groupings were not consistent across
countries, where boys and girls were presented separately,
boys’ intakes were generally higher than girls’ and older chil-
dren had higher intakes (see Fig. 1). The mean energy intake
was 6·0 (range 5·3–8·0) MJ and 7·7 (range 6·6–9·4) MJ for
girls <10 years and ≥10 years, respectively, and 6·3 (range 5·5–
8·5) MJ and 9·4 (range 8·2–12·7) MJ for boys.
Macronutrients. For all macronutrients, where age groups
were split by sex, boys generally had higher intakes than girls in
all countries except Slovenia, particularly in older children.
WHO RNI(15,21) attainment was universally poor in both sexes
across all ages in the majority of macronutrients. The TFA RNI
had the highest compliance, with all countries that reported
intakes falling below the maximum value. No country fell short
of the 10 %E minimum protein value and half the surveys fell
between the 10 and 15 %E minimum and maximum boundaries.
Only Slovenian teenagers and Dutch young children met the
lower 55 %E carbohydrate RNI (Fig. 2). The mean carbohydrate
intake was 183 (range 126–255) g and 233 (range 192–379) g for
girls aged <10 years and ≥10 years, respectively, and 192 (range
126–258) g and 281 (range 211–370) g for boys. Of the six
countries that reported added sugars (n 6), Ireland (1 year),
Denmark (4–9 years), Norway (4 years) and Austrian boys (10–
12 and 13–14 years) had intakes between the recommended
5 %E and maximum 10 %E RNI and all other children exceeded
the maximum (Fig. 3). Mean added sugar intakes were 46
(range 25–56) g and 58 (range 48–110) g for girls <10 years
and ≥10 years, respectively, and 48 (range 25–61) g and 63
(range 49–103) g for boys. Only Slovenian adolescents and
German boys (14–18 years) met the 25 g fibre RNI (Fig. 4).
Mean fibre intakes were 12 (range 8–19) g and 17 (range 9–31)
g for girls <10 years and ≥10 years, respectively, and 13 (range
8–21) g and 18 (range 11–28) g for boys.
Total fat and saturated fats RNI compliance was particularly
poor – all countries in all age groups exceeded the latter and
only Slovenia and the Netherlands (2–3 years) had fat intakes
below the 30 %E maximum RNI, but these were close to the

 upper boundary (Figs. 5 and 6). Mean fat intakes were 56
(range 38–80) g and 71 (range 60–148) g for girls <10 years
and ≥10 years, respectively, and 58 (range 38–80) g and 86
(range 66–177) g for boys. For saturated fats this was 21 (range
14–32) g and 25 (range 16–35) g for girls <10 years and
≥10 years, respectively, and 22 (range 14–34) g and 30 (range
18–38) g for boys. PUFA RNI attainment was mixed, although
all countries except Turkey that achieved the RNI were very
close to the lower 6 %E boundary (Fig. 7). Mean PUFA intakes
were 10 (range 4–17) g for both sexes aged <10 years and
13 (range 9–19) g for girls and 15 (range 10–21 g) for boys
aged ≥10 years.
RNI attainment was relatively poor for the seven countries that
reported n-3 and n-6 (omega) fat intakes; only Estonian boys
(14–17 years) achieved the lower 1 %E n-3 RNI (Fig. 8). Just over
half of countries reporting n-6 achieved the lower 5 %E RNI in
some age categories (Fig. 9). Turkey was the only country to
exceed the upper 8 %E n-6 limit in any age group. Mean n-3
intakes were 1·0 (range 0·5–1·5) g and 1·3 (range 0·5–1·6) g
for girls <10 years and ≥10 years, respectively, and 1·0 (range
0·5–1·4) g and 1·5 (range 0·5–2·5) g for boys. Mean n-6 intakes
were 8·6 (range 3·0–15·6) g and 11·4 (range 3·1–17·3) g for
girls <10 years and ≥10 years, respectively, and 9·2 (range
2·9–15·6) g and 13·1 (range 3·1–19·7) g for boys.
Micronutrients. Micronutrient RNI attainment(16–18) was better
than for macronutrients. Micronutrient intakes are grouped
according to RNI compliance and described beginning with
those with greatest compliance across the countries and ending
with those that demonstrate the greatest shortfall. All micro-
nutrients except vitamin D had age-specific RNI; Fe and Zn
also had sex-specific RNI for children aged 10–18 years. RNI
compliance was greater in boys and younger children aged
<10 years.
All countries met the vitamin B12 RNI across all ages, with
the exception of Turkish adolescent girls. The majority of
countries met the Zn RNI across the age groups surveyed;
however, attainment gaps were most likely to be in adolescent
girls. K and Fe intakes were mixed, but generally poorer in
children aged ≥10 years and girls, particularly for Fe (Figs. 10
and 11). All countries (except France) fulfilled the K RNI in
some age groups and only Slovenian adolescent girls and
German and Estonian adolescent boys exceeded the upper
3500 mg RNI. However, no country met the lower K RNI
across all childhood stages. Mean intakes were 1974 (range
1471–2700) mg and 2481 (range 1867–3770) mg for girls <10
years and ≥10 years, respectively, and 2062 (range 1471–3000)
mg and 2768 (range 2039–3800) mg for boys. Bulgaria and
France did not achieve the UK Fe RNI(21) in any age group. In
other countries lack of compliance with the Fe RNI was
dominated by adolescent girls, where only Slovenia achieved
the RNI. Boys had slightly higher intakes than girls – mean
intakes were 6·6 (range 5·0–10·9) mg and 9·8 (range 7·7–16·0)
mg for girls <10 years and ≥10 years, respectively, and 7·3
(range 5·0–11·4) mg and 11·8 (range 9·0–16·0) mg for boys.
However, boys have lower requirements, resulting in higher
RNI attainment.

* Where mean intakes were reported by a country for more than one age group < 10 years, or more than one age group ≥ 10 years, the numbers of children/adolescents surveyed in the national diet survey for each age group and sex
were used to weight the reported means to produce estimate mean intakes for those aged < 10 years and those aged ≥ 10 years for each nutrient. Countries that span the 10-year boundary are: Cyprus (9–13·9 years); Ireland (9–12
years); Latvia (7–16 years); the Netherlands (9–13 years); Spain (9–12 years); Turkey (9–11 years) and the UK (4–10 years). For each nutrient regional weighted means for North, West and Central and Eastern Europe and Europe
overall were calculated by weighting the < 10 years and ≥ 10 years country means shown in the table by the total child population in that country(22–24).

 Ca and iodine attainment was also mixed; 75 % countries
reporting Ca achieved the RNI in some age groups, though no
country had adequate intakes in children aged ≥10 years (Fig.
12). Mean Ca intakes were 691 (range 26–1113) mg and 755
(range 545–1167 mg) for girls <10 years and ≥10 years,
respectively, and 729 (range 515–966 mg) and 903 (range
554–1277 mg) for boys. Three of the ten countries reporting
iodine (Turkey, Austria, France) did not achieve the RNI in any
age group (Fig. 13); of the remainder, attainment was spread
across age groups. Mean intakes were 93 (range 44–272) µg
and 109 (range 52–213) µg for girls <10 years and ≥10 years,
respectively, and 99 (range 47–283) µg and 137 (range 53–249)
µg for boys.
Irish boys (13–14 years) were the only group aged > 3 years
with adequate total folate intakes (Fig. 14). Mean intakes were
193 (range 104–270) µg and 259 (range 137–340) µg for
girls <10 years and ≥10 years, respectively, and 205 (range
104–289) µg and 304 (range 143–410) µg for boys. The lowest
RNI attainment was in vitamin D, where only French and
Portuguese children aged <10 years had sufficient intakes (Fig.
15). Mean intakes were 2·7 (range 0·8–6·4) µg and 2·0 (range
0·8–4·0) µg for girls <10 years and ≥10 years, respectively, and
2·6 (range 0·8–6·7) µg and 2·4 (range 1·0–4·3) µg for boys.
Most countries over-consumed Na – only Estonian girls
aged ≥10 years and Turkish adolescent girls did not exceed
the 1600 mg RNI (Fig. 16). Mean intakes were 1492 (range
918–3320 mg) and 2095 (range 1434–4191 mg) for girls <10
years and ≥10 years, respectively, and 1702 (range 918–3520
mg) and 2765 (range 1599–4059 mg) for boys.
Discussion
Data extracted
The present review details the reporting of child intake data for
energy and selected nutrients of concern in nationally repre-
sentative surveys across the fifty-three countries in the WHO
Europe remit(1). Only a third of countries, mostly Western
European, reported intake data by sex and age group. This is
concerning, as potential micronutrient deficiencies may go
unidentified and nutrition policies in two-thirds of the WHO
Europe region, particularly outside Western Europe, may be
based on limited contextual evidence that can be critical in
tailoring policies to local needs. This makes impacts on other
NDS and has longer-term implications for obesity; over 60 %
children who are overweight before puberty are likely to
remain so in adulthood(25). Although Southern European
countries have previously had the highest prevalence in chil-
dren aged 6–9 years(26,27), there has been a particularly marked
increase in childhood obesity in CEEC since 2002(28). In addi-
tion, six of the top ten countries for overweight and obesity in
girls, and five of the top ten countries for boys aged 7–9 years in
the Childhood Obesity Surveillance Initiative round 4 were
CEEC(29). This is concerning, as increased intakes of processed
foods driven by food system changes induced by the nutrition
transition in CEEC(30) could begin to affect later years. If dietary
data are lacking, countries may struggle to advocate and design
effective policies.

* Where mean intakes were reported by a country for more than one age group < 10 years, or more than one age group ≥ 10 years, the number of children/adolescents surveyed in the national diet survey for each age group and sex
were used to weight the reported means to produce estimate mean intakes for those aged < 10 years and those aged ≥ 10 years for each nutrient. Countries that span the 10-years boundary are: Cyprus (9–13·9 years); Ireland (9–12
years); Latvia (7–16 years); the Netherlands (9–13 years); Spain (9–12 years); Turkey (9–11 years) and the UK (4–10 years). For each nutrient regional weighted means for North, West and Central and Eastern Europe and Europe
overall were calculated by weighting the < 10 years and ≥ 10 years country means shown in the table by the total child population in that country(22–24).

 Energy, and macro- and micronutrients were generally
widely reported in the twenty-one surveys across eighteen
countries from which intakes were extracted, though some
gaps were evident. Energy was universally reported, and
macronutrients
slightly
better
represented
than
micro-
nutrients. This forms a good foundation for assessing child
nutrient status and identifying vulnerable age/sex groups.
The largest nutrient gaps in reported intakes were TFA, n-3
and n-6 (omega) fats, added sugars and iodine, all of which
have been highlighted as of concern(1,31). Iodine deficiency
has been linked to reduced cognitive function in children(32)
and
remains
an
issue
in
the
WHO
European
region.
Andersson et al.(33) examined national (about 65 %) and
subnational (about 35 %) data on urinary iodine concentra-
tion and found that 43·9 % of European school-age children
had insufficient intakes.
n-3 Fatty acids have established links with reduced blood
pressure and CHD risk in adulthood, amongst other health
benefits(34,35),
including
brain
development(36).

 Although there were no regional patterns in nutrient reporting,
Latvia only reported on energy and Na intakes and Spain
included no micronutrients. This has implications for national
nutrition policies and identification of vulnerable groups in
these countries.
Only a third of countries reported energy and nutrient
intake by socio-economic group, by one or more indicators
including education, occupation, income and social class
(Table 4). This narrows opportunities to assess nutrient-based
socio-economic inequalities in population subgroups, and
prevents comparisons with countries that do include such
stratification. Vulnerable groups may therefore be susceptible
to malnutrition, with limited monitoring tools for preventative
policy formation.
Energy intakes
As expected, boys and older children had generally higher energy
intakes. There were no obvious regional trends, though German
and Slovenian adolescent boys had particularly high intakes,
possibly due to the age range being limited to older adolescents.
The literature suggests that under-reporting affects reported
intakes to varying degrees across countries, making valid com-
parisons difficult, particularly considering that in different surveys
children reported their own intake at different ages. Rothausen
et al.(37) found that misreporting in Danish children aged 7–8 years

 was ‘modest’, and greater in those aged 12–13 years, particularly in
food diaries compared with 24 h recalls. Similarly, Lioret et al.(38)
found greater under-reporting in French children aged≥10 years
than in those aged<10 years, and one study found under-
reporting in British children aged 11–17 years as high as 73%(39).
This suggests that the energy differential between younger and
older children may be higher than that reported.

status
Countries in all WHO Europe regions had poor RNI attainment
levels – only Slovenia met over half of the RNI for those
nutrients and age/sex groups reported (Table 4). This is con-
cerning, as it implies that nutritional issues affect children across
Europe, to an extent that may be difficult to determine due to
the limitations of the data available and the gaps in data for
some countries and nutrients. Older adolescents in the ≥10
years range are more likely to meet RNI based on absolute
levels rather than %E, such as fibre. This could explain why
Slovenia had the highest percentage compliance (42 %), having
generally high intakes across the nutrients extracted. This could
be due to the narrow adolescent age range surveyed (15–16
years); Germany had a similar age range (14–18 years) and also
had relatively high intakes. However, other countries with
similar age groupings had lower intakes, supporting the possi-
bility of the differences being genuine.

 the fibre RNI, which represents an absolute amount rather than
%E and is not a child-specific target. Northern European chil-
dren <10 years were more likely to meet the added sugar RNI,
and other than Slovenian adolescents, Dutch children aged <10
years were the only other group to meet the lower carbohydrate
RNI. This suggests that in countries where sugar data were
present, most children, particularly those aged ≥10 years, could
be at greater risk of the weight gain and associated risks linked
to high sugar and low complex carbohydrate consumption(40).
Most countries had intakes indicating an unfavourable fatty
acid balance across all age groups; all countries were over the
upper RNI for saturated fats in all age groups and only Slovenia
and very young Dutch children were below the maximum fat
RNI. Dutch children aged 2–3 years were the only group with a
favourable fatty acid profile, achieving the PUFA in addition to
the total fat RNI. Slovenian children neither achieved the PUFA
RNI nor had a substantial MUFA intake compared with other
children aged ≥10 years. The Netherlands and Turkey met the
PUFA and n-6 RNI in all ages and Austria, the Netherlands and
Portugal met the n-6 RNI in older children. Spain also met the
PUFA RNI in all ages and Cyprus, Italy and Spain had relatively
high MUFA intakes. The favourable intakes in these countries
could indicate aspects of a Mediterranean diet pattern, which
when adhered to in its complete form and supported by other
factors such as physical activity, has been linked to reduced
childhood obesity(41). Conversely, n-3 intakes were poor, with
only Estonian adolescent boys achieving the RNI.
TFA had the highest RNI compliance for those countries
which reported it. This may reflect positive moves to reduce
levels in the food supply following advice from health bodies
like the WHO(1), including bans, labelling legislation and
voluntary
product
reformulation(42–44).
However,
the
low
number of countries reporting TFA demonstrates the need for a
common and comprehensive blueprint for conducting NDS and
gathering nutrient intake data across Europe.
Micronutrients. As with macronutrients, there were no clear
regional patterns in micronutrient intakes or RNI attainment.
However, compliance was highest in boys and children
aged <10 years. Unlike macronutrients, micronutrient RNI are
based on absolute intakes rather than %E. Yet although most
micronutrients have different RNI for specific age groups,
intakes in children aged ≥10 years were generally not sufficient
to meet RNI for older children, particularly girls. Even in Zn and
vitamin B12, where RNI attainment was high, shortfalls in ado-
lescent girls were apparent, highlighting them as a vulnerable
group.
Although not the worst in overall RNI attainment, Fe was a
particular issue for adolescent girls, with all countries except
Slovenia having inadequate intakes. This is consistent with
previous (non-national) European-based reviews and relates to
higher requirements, primarily due to menstruation(45,46). Ado-
lescent girls are at greater risk of Fe-deficiency anaemia, and
deficiency is associated with reduced intellectual, immune and
other metabolic functions(46). Deficiency in this group may also
be underestimated, as UK RNI were used instead of WHO RNI
because the latter have different values for different bioavail-
abilities and menarchal status, which would be difficult to
determine(16). However, although agreement between the UK
and WHO RNI was good for children aged <10 years, WHO RNI
requirements are much higher for girls post-menarche, even
when using the RNI that assumes the highest bioavailability
from diet (15 %)(16,21). The scale of European deficiency in this
group may therefore be greater than previously thought, and
policy initiatives may be required to improve Fe intakes.
Ca intakes were inadequate in older boys and girls. Ca is
needed for bone and tooth development, metabolic processes
including muscle and nerve function and its metabolism is
linked with vitamin D intake. Vitamin D intakes, assessed by a
singular absolute amount, rather than age-specific RNI, were
universally lacking other than in younger Portuguese children.
This is an important issue, as in addition to roles in bone,

 muscle and immune function, deficiency is linked to rick-
ets(47,48). Although rickets was of relatively little concern in
Europe in the latter half of the 20th century, in recent years
prevalence has risen, particularly in the UK and Northern Eur-
opean countries and for individuals with darker skin or who
cover up for religious and other reasons, as less can be syn-
thesised on exposure to sunlight(49).
Total folate intakes were universally poor, with no children
aged > 3 years achieving the RNI. Na intakes exceeded the RNI
in all children except adolescent girls from Estonia and Turkey,
which are both CEEC. This is despite the potential for under-
reporting due to intakes being derived from self-assessed diet-
ary methodologies rather than 24 h urinary biomarkers. Further
efforts are needed to promote the consumption of low-salt,
minimally processed foods and advance reformulation of foods
commonly consumed by children – these will vary by country,
but might include bread, cheeses and breakfast cereals. How-
ever, salt iodisation is a primary means of increasing population
iodine intakes, and iodine was the least reported micronutrient.
Calls to reduce salt intake can lead to questions of compatibility
with iodine intake goals, especially in CEEC. With almost half of
European school-age children having insufficient intakes(33),
which can cause reduced cognitive function(32), care is needed
in approaches to tackle Na over-consumption, especially where
iodine RNI attainment is low and salt iodisation is practised(50).
However, evidence is clear that appropriate Na and iodine
intakes can be achieved in the context of Na reduction initia-
tives(18), as iodine concentration in salt can be increased or
alternative vehicles for iodine sourced.
Of the micronutrients investigated, our findings show that Fe,
vitamin D, total folate and Na would benefit from European-
wide policy focus to improve intakes, particularly in girls and
children aged ≥10 years. Effective food-based approaches,
including product reformulation and fortification, currently exist
alongside targeted supplementation for at-risk groups. Aside
from total folate, the WHO Europe Food and Nutrition Action
Plan(1) identifies these as nutrients of concern, although this
refers to all ages rather than specifically children. The Action
Plan also highlights energy, saturated fat and sugar reduction as
priorities and recommends a suite of policy options to address
their excess intake, which our findings support. However, the
plan does not discuss the increase of carbohydrate, fibre or n-3
and n-6 (omega) fats, and our findings show that the RNI for
these were often not met. Countries across WHO Europe should
also be encouraged to address this in policy and guidance, for
example increased use of whole grains in manufactured pro-
ducts
or
public
education
on
sources
of
n-3
and
n-6
(omega) fats.
Strengths and limitations
This review presents a much-needed up-to-date review of
national child energy and nutrient intakes across Europe. It also
reports intakes against WHO RNI, enabling governments and
policymakers to better use NDS to inform initiatives to improve
diets and reduce diet-related diseases in groups and areas of
greatest need. It is well documented that energy, macronutrient
and Na over-consumption is linked to childhood obesity and
related NCD(1) and poor micronutrient intakes continue to
cause health problems in children(45,46,49). Blundell et al.(51)
found > 10 % inter-country variation in obesity prevalence and
cited differences in national age profiles and sociodemographic
patterns as key contributors. The present review highlights both
the scale and the potential hidden extent of such issues,
showing that reported lack of compliance with WHO RNI may
be the tip of the iceberg, with many countries’ intakes
unknown. In addition to previous reviews, which document
NDS provision across Europe(6,12), the present review also
highlights whether and how surveys report nutrient intakes by
socio-economic group, helping to direct further research in
this area.
A primary limitation is that inter-country comparisons are
difficult, as age groupings were inconsistent. The most extreme
example of this drawback was in Andorra, which could not
be included in the present review as the lowest age group
included both adults and children. Age groupings also differed
within countries; Bulgaria split children into four groups for
energy, but two for other macro- and micronutrients, making
consistent and complete analysis difficult. In addition, several
countries did not separate girls and boys in the youngest age
groups. Raw survey data could be used in future work to create
consistent age groups and obtain more reliable conclusions.
Differences in the reporting of nutrient intakes across and
within countries further hindered comparisons and, in some
cases, limited RNI assessment. For example, Estonia did not
report nutrients in all age groups and the three Irish surveys
reported different nutrients. Bulgaria reported some nutrients
by %E and others with absolute values; because age groups for
energy differed from other nutrients, the %E needed to assess
macronutrient RNI could not always be calculated, resulting in
knowledge gaps. Age groups did not always correspond with
RNI age boundaries, particularly in micronutrients, making it
difficult to assess attainment. However, examples in the litera-
ture exist where international comparisons are made despite
different age groupings(7). Using RNI to assess nutrient intake
adequacy also has limitations, as assertions are only as good as
the data on which they are based, which may be incomplete.
RNI are estimates of the amount of a nutrient needed to ensure
that the needs of the majority of a group (97·5 %) are being met;
therefore RNI err on the side of caution and may over-estimate
inadequacies. The proportion of intakes in a population group
below the estimated average requirements is a more appro-
priate measure of nutrient inadequacy than the proportion
below the RNI; however, lack of raw data from sufficient
countries prevented this(16). Additionally, although the <10
years and ≥10 years age group splits were chosen to align with
the RNI age cut-offs, different cut-offs will have produced dif-
ferent results. Despite these difficulties, the present review
remains an important study that displays nutrient intakes in
children, which the WHO defines as a vulnerable group(1). Any
difficulties posed by lack of comparability serve to highlight the
pressing
need
for
harmonisation
of
methodologies
and
approaches.
The country means (Tables 5 and 6) for the <10 years or ≥10
years groups are approximations that depend on the age ranges
surveyed. For instance, the Slovenian NDS covered a small age

 range (15–16 years); reported mean intakes may therefore be
less representative of the ≥10 years group than countries that
have surveyed a wider age range. Similarly, the contribution to
the weighted estimated means for its region and Europe overall
may be unrepresentative. The country-specific means for
countries with multiple age groups above or below the 10-year
cut-off are approximations based on the assumption that the
numbers surveyed in each age group are proportionate to those
in the total child population, the latter being used due to
availability. Additionally, in some countries age ranges spanned
the 10-year boundary, though broadly speaking the majority of
children could be allocated to either the <10 years or ≥10
years group.
The different dietary assessment methodologies used by the
surveys also limit the validity of comparisons. As under-
reporting is common and varies across methods and is affec-
ted by multiple other factors, the impact on reported intakes
differs across countries and compounds difficulties in making
comparisons. This is exacerbated by the exclusion of under-
reporters by some countries (Austria, France, Norway), whereas
other countries include under-reporters (Cyprus, Denmark,
Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Slovenia and the UK) and the

Discrepancies in national food composition databases create
further compatibility issues. The present review used sucrose as
a proxy for added sugars, as surveys typically did not distin-
guish between the two. Consequently, intakes may differ as the
number of mono- and disaccharides included varies. Not all
surveys had available user guides to determine the methods
used to derive nutrient values. With fibre, the Englyst method
usually generates lower results than the AOAC for certain cer-
eals, fruits, white beans and groundnuts(52). Certain micro-
nutrients may also be derived from a narrow range of foods,
making them less valid in representing population intakes.
Similarly, databases do not address fortification in a common
manner, as with iodine(53). This is problematic, as the severity of
identified deficiencies may be misrepresented.
Future work could explore raw survey data to create common
age groups and minimise the impact of inconsistencies. This
would help determine whether extremes such as Slovenian mac-
ronutrient intakes are genuine differences or due to the age range
covered. It would also allow the alignment of age groups with
WHO RNI, increasing the accuracy of identifying deficiencies.
Conclusion
This review reported macro- and selected micronutrient
intakes in children across WHO Europe using the latest
available reported NDS intakes and assessed these against
WHO RNI. Energy and nutrient intakes were extracted from
twenty-one surveys covering a third (eighteen), mainly
Western, WHO European countries. Most countries reported
intakes from a good range of nutrients, particularly macro-
nutrients, so where nutrient intakes were reported, countries
generally had a sound basis to assess child nutrient status.
However, TFA, n-3 and n-6 (omega) fats, added sugar and
iodine were least reported. These gaps are concerning, as
potential deficiencies could go undetected and nutrition
policies implemented could be based on limited evidence.
WHO RNI attainment was generally poor – most countries
met under half of the RNI for the nutrients and age/sex
groups reported, implying that widespread nutrition issues
could exist across Europe. Macronutrient RNI compliance
was universally poor, and although micronutrients were
slightly better, attainment was worse in girls and children ≥10
years. Fat and saturated fats, vitamin D, Na, total folate and Fe
had the lowest compliance. Only eight countries reported
intakes by socio-economic group and different indicators
were used. This narrows opportunities to assess inequalities
and vulnerable groups susceptible to malnutrition and limits
the monitoring tools available for policy formation. Different
age groups, methodologies, nutrient composition databases
and under-reporting are the main limitations, potentially
misrepresenting true intakes and preventing inter-country
comparisons. Future work could use raw NDS data to con-
duct stratified analyses with consistent age groups. Govern-
ments
and
health
bodies
should
continue
efforts
to
encourage European countries to report a full range of
nutrient intakes by various sociodemographic variables in a
standardised format.
