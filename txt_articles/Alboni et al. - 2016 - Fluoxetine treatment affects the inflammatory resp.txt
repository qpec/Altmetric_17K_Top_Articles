Abstract: It has been hypothesized that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), the most common
treatment for major depression, affect mood through changes in immune function. However, the effects
of SSRIs on inflammatory response are contradictory since these act either as anti- or pro-inflammatory
drugs.
Previous experimental and clinical studies showed that the quality of the living environment
moderates the outcome of antidepressant treatment.
Therefore, we hypothesized that the interplay
between SSRIs and the environment may, at least partially, explain the apparent incongruence regarding
the effects of SSRI treatment on the inflammatory response.
In order to investigate such interplay,
we exposed C57BL/6 mice to chronic stress to induce a depression-like phenotype and, subsequently, to
fluoxetine treatment or vehicle (21days) while being exposed to either an enriched or a stressful condition.
At the end of treatment, we measured the expression levels of several anti- and pro-inflammatory cytokines
and inflammatory mediators in the whole hippocampus and in isolated microglia. We also determined
microglial density, distribution, and morphology to investigate their surveillance state. Results show that
the effects of fluoxetine treatment on inflammation and microglial function, as compared to vehicle, were
dependent on the quality of the living environment. In particular, fluoxetine administered in the enriched
condition increased the expression of pro-inflammatory markers compared to vehicle, while treatment in
a stressful condition produced anti-inflammatory effects. These findings provide new insights regarding
the effects of SSRIs on inflammation, which may be crucial to devise pharmacological strategies aimed
at enhancing antidepressant efficacy by means of controlling environmental conditions.

Abstract 
It has been hypothesized that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), the most common 
treatment for major depression, affect mood through changes in immune function. However, the effects 
of SSRIs on inflammatory response are contradictory since these drugs act either as anti- or pro-
inflammatory. Previous experimental and clinical studies showed that the quality of the living 
environment moderates the outcome of antidepressant treatment. Therefore, we hypothesized that the 
interplay between SSRIs and environment may, at least partially, explain the apparent incongruence 
regarding the effects of SSRI treatment on the inflammatory response. In order to investigate such 
interplay, we exposed C57BL/6 mice to chronic stress to induce a depression-like phenotype and, 
subsequently, to fluoxetine treatment or vehicle (21 days) while being exposed to either an enriched or 
a stressful condition. At the end of treatment, we measured the expression levels of several anti- and 
pro-inflammatory cytokines and inflammatory mediators in the whole hippocampus and in isolated 
microglia. We also determined microglial density, distribution, and morphology to investigate their 
surveillance state. Results show that the effects of fluoxetine treatment on inflammation and microglial 
function, as compared to vehicle, were dependent on the quality of the living environment. In particular, 
fluoxetine administered in the enriched condition increased the expression of pro-inflammatory markers 
compared to vehicle, while treatment in a stressful condition produced anti-inflammatory effects. These 
findings provide new insights regarding the effects of SSRIs on inflammation, which may be crucial to 
devise pharmacological strategies aimed at enhancing antidepressant efficacy by means of controlling

Introduction 
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the most commonly prescribed drugs for the 
treatment of major depression (MD), which constitutes an enormous medical, individual, societal and 
economical challenge and afflicts up to 10-15% of the population worldwide. However, the efficacy of 
SSRIs is variable and incomplete: 60–70% of patients do not experience remission and 30–40% do not 
show a significant response (Trivedi et al., 2006). One of the main reasons for such limited efficacy is 
the poor comprehension of their mechanisms of action at cellular and molecular levels. 
In recent decades, the crosstalk between the innate and adaptive immune systems and the brain 
has been suggested to represent a key factor in antidepressant drug action (Carvalho et al., 2013; Eller 
et al., 2008; Lanquillon et al., 2000; Tuglu et al., 2003). Indeed, treatment with SSRIs has been shown 
to decrease MD associated cytokine elevations. In particular, the levels of inflammatory cytokines IL-
1β, IL-6 and TNFα have been reported to be reduced following SSRI treatment (Basterzi et al., 2005; 
Kagaya et al., 2001; Lanquillon et al., 2000; Leo et al., 2006; Tuglu et al., 2003; Yoshimura et al., 2009). 
In addition, elevated baseline levels of TNFα and IL-6 correlate with treatment failure (Carvalho et al., 
2013; Eller et al., 2008; Lanquillon et al., 2000). However, other clinical studies obtained opposite 
results, demonstrating no or even pro-inflammatory effects of antidepressant treatment (Chen et al., 
2010; Haastrup et al., 2012; Hannestad et al., 2011; Jazayeri et al., 2010; Kim et al., 2013; Song et al., 
2009). Experimental studies reflect the incongruence of clinical findings. Indeed, though many studies 
attributed anti-inflammatory effects to antidepressant drugs (Bielecka et al., 2010; Kenis and Maes, 
2002; Obuchowicz et al., 2006; Tynan et al., 2012; Xia et al., 1996), pro-inflammatory effects were 
reported as well (Diamond et al., 2006; Horikawa et al., 2010; Horowitz et al., 2015; Kubera et al., 
2005; Tynan et al., 2012). Such discrepancy suggests that SSRIs may not have a univocal effect on 
inflammatory processes and additional factors may moderate the complex interplay between 
antidepressants and inflammation (Kraemer et al., 2006). 
Recently, a number of preclinical studies have identified the living environment as a key moderator 
of the outcome of SSRI treatment (Alboni et al., 2016; Branchi, 2011; Branchi et al., 2013). In particular, 
since the increase in serotonin levels induced by SSRIs enhances neural plasticity, rendering individuals 
more susceptible to environmental conditions, the outcome of SSRI administration is not univocal but 
depends on the quality of the environment. This view, named the undirected susceptibility to change 
 4 
 
hypothesis, is supported by clinical studies showing that antidepressants are more effective in patients 
with a good quality of life, while having no or even detrimental consequences in patients experiencing 
stressful conditions (Cohen et al., 2006; Trivedi et al., 2006). Accordingly, the quality of the environment 
has been shown to determine the outcome of SSRI treatment on the vulnerability to obesity 
(Mastronardi et al., 2011; Wong and Licinio, 2001). Though the influence of the living environment in 
driving SSRI effects on depressive symptomatology starts to be unraveled, no information on its role in 
moderating SSRI effects on the inflammatory response is yet available. 
The aim of the present study was to determine whether fluoxetine treatment, as compared to vehicle, 
affects the inflammatory response, which notably involves microglial cells within the brain, according to 
the quality of the living environment. To this purpose, we exposed C57BL/6 mice first to 14 days of 
stress, in order to induce a depression-like phenotype and, subsequently, to 21 days of either (i) an 
enriched or (ii) a stressful condition, while receiving fluoxetine or vehicle. We assessed the expression 
levels of several key inflammatory markers in the hippocampus, a highly plastic brain region that is 
deeply involved in MD and antidepressant effects (MacQueen and Frodl, 2011). In addition, in order to 
investigate possible changes in microglial function, we measured the expression levels of several 
inflammatory markers in freshly isolated hippocampal microglial cells, as well as microglial density, 
distribution and morphology. Our prediction was that the trajectories of inflammatory and microglial 
modifications induced by fluoxetine treatment depend on the living environment. 
The results concerning the neural and behavioral response to fluoxetine treatment displayed in the 
different environmental conditions by the experimental subjects used in this study have been published 
elsewhere (Alboni et al., 2016). These show that the exposure to 14 days of stress before treatment 
induced a depression-like phenotype and the neurobehavioral profile was affected by treatment 
according to the quality of the environment.

Materials and methods 
2.1  Animals and housing conditions 
C57BL/6 male mice 12–15 week old were used and kept under 12-hour light-dark cycle at 22–25°C. 
Animals were housed in the Intellicage system (TSE-system, NewBehavior AG, Zürich, Switzerland), 
which is an apparatus designed for the automatic monitoring of mouse behavior (Branchi et al., 2013). 
Food was freely available. Animals were examined for signs of discomfort as indicated by the animal 
care and use guidelines [National Academy of Sciences. Guide for the care and use of laboratory animals, 
1998, “Guidelines for the Care and Use of Mammals in Neuroscience and Behavioral Research” (National 
Research Council 2003)]. All procedures were carried out in accordance with the EC guidelines (EEC 
Council Directive 2010/63/UE86/609 1987), Italian legislation on animal experimentation (Decreto 
Legislativo 26/2014). 
The animals were gradually habituated to the Intellicage environment during a 14-days period. Five 
days before being moved to the Intellicage, each animal was injected with a subcutaneous transponder 
(T-IS 8010 FDX-B; Datamars SA, Switzerland). Three independent experiments were performed. In each 
experiment, animals were housed in enriched or stressful conditions, and received fluoxetine or vehicle. 
Enriched condition: the Intellicage provides an enriched environment because mice are socially 
housed and exposed to Plexiglas shelters of different colors and shapes (four red transparent Tecniplast 
plastic nest boxes and four white opaque boxes), and to tissue paper. New paper was provided every 5 
days and the plastic shelters were cleaned every week. 
Stressful condition: The mice were exposed each day to a different stressor, randomly chosen among 
social stress and other stressful procedures provided by the Intellicage. Exposing mice to different 
stressors was used to prevent habituation to each of these. The stressful procedures used are: Social 
stress: moving animals from one Intellicage into another, creating new social groups hence forcing mice 
to re-establish their social hierarchy; Short open door: door to access water or saccharin remains open 
for only 1.5 seconds; Open door 25%: door opens only following 25% of nosepokes; Air puff: when the 
mouse enters the corner, it has a 20% chance of receiving an air puff; Delayed door: door opens 2.5 
seconds after the first nosepoke. In addition, in the stressful condition, no shelter or tissue paper was 
provided. 
 6 
 
Standard condition: mice were housed in a standard laboratory condition, two individuals per cage. 
Each cage was 33 x 13 x 14 cm Plexiglas box with metal tops and sawdust as bedding. Pellet food and 
tap water were provided ad libitum.  
 
2.2  Treatment 
Fluoxetine (Fluoxetine HCl, SantaCruz, USA) was dissolved in water or saccharin solution and 
delivered ad libitum in the drinking bottles for 3 weeks. Compared to injection, this administration 
method avoids stress due to the handling. The solutions were prepared according to the mouse average 
weight and daily water consumption in order to provide an average daily intake of 30 mg/kg. The 
average amount of fluoxetine administered to each mouse did not differ among the enriched, the 
stressful, or standard conditions. According to previous studies, such intake allows to reach an effective 
fluoxetine serum level approximating 150 ng/ml (Dulawa et al., 2004). Bottles were wrapped in tin foil 
as to protect the substance from light.  
Treatment in the enriched condition: mice underwent a 14-days stress period consisting in random 
exposure to different stressful procedures (see above, Stressful condition). Afterwards, mice were 
housed for 21 days in the enriched condition while being treated with fluoxetine or vehicle (Fig. 1A).  
Treatment in the stressful condition: mice underwent a 14-days stress period (as above described). 
Afterwards, they were exposed to a second stress period (21 days) while receiving fluoxetine or vehicle 
(Fig. 1A). 
Treatment in the standard condition: mice underwent a 14-days stress period (as above described). 
Afterwards, they were placed for 21 days in standard laboratory cages, two mice per cage, while 
receiving fluoxetine or vehicle (Fig. 1B). 
 
2.3  RNA extraction, RT-PCR and Real Time PCR on entire hippocampus 
Total RNA was extracted from the hippocampi of 8 animals per group with a GeneEluteTM 
Mammalian Total RNA Moniprep kit (Sigma, St. Louis, MO. USA) using On-Column DNAse I Digestion 
Set (Sigma, St. Louis, MO. USA) clean-up step in order to remove genomic contamination. Quantity of 
total RNA was determined using a ND-1000 Spectrophotometer (Nanodrop), and RNA integrity was 
assessed with an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Techonologies) to determinate the ratios of 28S–
 7 
 
18S ribosomal RNA band intensities (RNA integrity number). A cutoff of 8 for RNA integrity number 
value was applied in order to ensure a high sample quality. Two μg of total RNA were reverse transcribed 
using High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Life Technologies, Milan) in 20 μL of reaction mix. 
Real Time PCR was performed in LightCycler® 480 Instrument (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) using 
Power SYBR Green mix (Applied Biosystems®, Milan) added to the specific primers (see Supplementary 
Table 1 for primers sequences). The cycling parameters were: 95 °C 10 min and 95 °C 15 s, 60 °C 1 
min for 40 cycles. Single PCR products were subjected to a heat dissociation (gradual increase of 
temperature from 60 °C to 95 °C) and agarose gel separation in order to verify the absence of artifacts, 
such as primer-dimers or non-specific products. Direct detection of PCR products was monitored by 
measuring an increase in fluorescence intensity resulting from the binding of SYBR Green dye to neo-
formed double strand DNA during the amplification phase. Each sample was normalized to the 
expression of housekeeping gene GAPDH (NCBI accession number: NM_008084). Cycle threshold (Ct) 
value was determined by the SDS software 2.2.2 (Applied Biosystems®, Milan) and was utilized to 
calculate mRNA fold changes using the delta delta ct (ΔΔCt) method (calibrator: average of VEH treated 
control animals). For an appropriate application of comparative ΔΔCt method, it was demonstrated that 
amplification efficiency of the target genes and endogenous control gene were approximately equal 
(Alboni et al., 2011). 
 
2.4  Protein extraction and Western blotting 
For protein extraction, hippocampi from 8 animals per group were homogenized by potter (12 stroke 
at 600 rpm) in lysis buffer containing Hepes 10 mM, EGTA 0.1 mM, sucrose 0.28 M pH 7.4, 1X Complete 
protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche, Mannheim, Germany), NaPP 5 mM, NaF 20 mM, Na3VO4 1 mM. 
Protein concentration was determined with a standard protocol using Coomassie® reagent (Sigma-
Aldrich, Milan, Italy). Western blots were carried out on 30 μg of total or cytoplasm enriched extracts 
separated by 10-14% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto PVDF (Millipore) membranes. After blocking with 
5% non-fat dry milk in TBS-Tween 20 for 1 hr at room temperature, membranes were incubated with 
specific antibodies overnight at 4°C followed by secondary antibodies (HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit or 
anti-mouse IgG at appropriate dilutions) for 1 hr at room temperature (see Supplementary Table 2). 
Antibody binding was detected by using ImmobilonTM Western Chemiluminescent HRP substrate 
 8 
 
(Millipore). The levels of protein were calculated by measuring the peak densitometric area of the 
autoradiography analyzed with an image analyzer. The optical density (OD) for targets signals was 
normalized according to the OD of β-Tubulin. Ratios were expressed as percentage of relative control 
± SEM. Each experiment was performed twice and the mean of the OD ratios (target/internal standard) 
was analyzed. 
 
2.5  Histology 
Animals were sacrificed by an overdose of Pentobarbital (50mg/kg) and perfused transcardially with 
cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS) followed by cold 1% paraformaldehyde (PFA) with 15% saturated 
picric acid. Brains were dissected rapidly and the hippocampi removed. Isolated hippocampi were gently 
straightened and fixed with 4% PFA in grooves (25 x 4 x 8 mm) carved into PVC blocks. Hippocampi 
were post fixed in this straightened position for 3 hrs, PFA was exchanged every hour. 
 
2.6  Matrix embedding of straightened hippocampi 
Randomly selected left or right hippocampi were processed for immunohistochemistry as following: 
hippocampi were embedded in a gelatin-albumin protein matrix following the protocol developed by 
Smiley and Bleiwas (Smiley and Bleiwas, 2012). In brief, tissue was first cryoprotected by immersion in 
glycerol. A base layer of protein composed of gelatine-egg-albumin with the cross-linking reagents 
glutaraldehyde and lysine was prepared in molds (25 x 20 x 14 mm). Hippocampi were positioned in 
parallel on the slightly hardened base layer (5-6 hippocampi per mold) and gently pushed below the 
surface. After 10 min, the entire mold was filled up with freshly prepared protein matrix. Matrix blocks 
containing the embedded hippocampi were then cryoprotected by immersion into glycerol. Frozen blocks 
were cut perpendicular to the longitudinal/septotemporal axis of the hippocampi at 40 µm, series of 
every 10th section were collected and stored in cryoprotection solution until further processing. A 
reference series was mounted immediately in the correct anatomical order and Giemsa-stained (Giemsa 
stock solution 1.09204.0500, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) following the protocol of Iñiguez (Iniguez et 
al., 1985). One complete series of sections for each animal was processed for IBA1 
immunohistochemistry. For this, free-floating sections were washed extensively in Tris buffered saline 
(TBS) containing 0.05% Triton. For epitope retrieval, sections were treated shortly in the microwave 
 9 
 
with citrate buffer (Target Retrieval Solution, DAKO; 1:10, pH 6.0) and endogenous peroxidase activity 
was blocked with a 15-min incubation in 0.06% peroxidase. After pre-incubation in 2% normal goat 
serum with 0.25% Triton in TBS for 60 min at RT, the sections were incubated overnight with primary 
antibodies against IBA1 (rabbit-anti-IBA1, Wako Pure Chemicals, Japan, 1:3000). Incubation in 
secondary antibody (Goat anti Rabbit, Vectastain, 1:300) was followed by incubation with ABC solution 
(Vectastain). Finally, sections were stained with 3,3’ diaminobenzidine (DAB) and mounted, 
counterstained with hematoxylin solution, dehydrated and cover-slipped. 
 
2.7  Light microscopy imaging and analysis 
Color pictures were acquired in the central hippocampus CA1 stratum radiatum of 7 sections in each 
of 7 animals per experimental group using an Infinity 2 camera (5 MP; Lumenera), at 10X for the cellular 
density and spacing analysis, and at 40X for the morphology analysis. All the analysis was performed 
with the ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health). To determine cellular densities and spacing, 
the CA1 stratum radiatum was delineated in 10X pictures by using the freehand selection tool, based 
on the stereotaxic atlas of Paxinos and Franklin (Paxinos and Franklin, 2013), and its area measured in 
pixels and converted into mm2. The center of each microglial cell body (area ≥20µm2) was marked with 
a dot using the paintbrush tool. The analyze particles function was then used to automatically record 
cell numbers as well as spatial coordinates, enabling to determine the nearest neighbor distance for 
each cell by using the nearest neighbor distance plugin. Total cell number was divided by the total area 
to determine cellular density on a per animal basis. A spacing index was calculated as the square of the 
average nearest neighbor distance multiplied by microglial density on a per animal basis (Tremblay et 
al., 2012; Milior et al., 2015). 
To analyze morphology, a total of 15 microglial cells in each of 5 animals per experimental group 
were analyzed at 40X. Only cells whose cell body and proximal processes were perfectly in focus were 
included in the analysis. Every IBA1-immunopositive microglia in a particular picture was analyzed before 
moving on to the next picture as to not introduce selection bias (Tremblay et al., 2012; Milior et al., 
2015). For each microglia, the soma area was determined by drawing a line around the cell body by 
using the freehand selection tool. The arborization area was determined with the polygon selection tool 
to connect the most distal extremities of every process. The soma and arborization areas were calculated 
 10 
 
in pixels and converted into micrometers. A morphological index was determined by using the formula: 
soma area/arborization area. The larger the value, the greater the soma size was in relation to the 
arborization size (Tremblay et al., 2012). All analyses were performed blind to the experimental 
condition. 
 
2.8  Isolation of CD11b+ cells, total RNA extraction and Real-time PCR on CD11b+ cells 
Mice housed in standard, enriched or stressful environments, receiving fluoxetine or vehicle, were 
anesthetized and decapitated. Brains were removed, cut into small pieces and single-cell suspension 
was achieved by enzymatic digestion in trypsin (0.25 mg/ml) solution in Hank's balanced salt solution 
(HBSS). The tissue was further mechanically dissociated using a wide-tipped and the suspension was 
applied to a 30 m cell strainer. Cells were processed immediately for MASC MicroBead separation. The 
CD11b-positive (+) cells were magnetically labelled with CD11b MicroBeads. The cell suspension was 
loaded onto a MACS Column (Miltenyi Biotec, Germany) placed into the magnetic field of a MACS 
Separator. After removing the magnetic field, CD11b+ cells were eluted as positive fraction. Live 
CD11b+ cells were identified by flow cytometry (FACS) as previously indicated (Garofalo et al., 2015). 
Upon sorting of the CD11b+ and negative (-) fractions, total RNA was isolated using RNeasy Mini Kit, 
and processed for real-time PCR. The quality and yield of RNAs were verified with the Ultraspec 2000 
UV/Visible (Pharmacia Biotech). Reverse transcription reaction of the CD11b+ and - fractions was 
performed in a thermocycler (MJ Mini Personal Thermal Cycler; Biorad) using IScript TM Reverse 
Transcription Supermix (Biorad) according to the manufacturer's protocol, under the following 
conditions: incubation at 25 °C for 5 min, reverse transcription at 42 °C for 30 min, inactivation at 85 
°C for 5 min. Real-time PCR (RT-PCR) was carried out in a I-Cycler IQ Multicolor RT-PCR Detection 
System (Biorad) using SsoFast EvaGreen Supermix (Biorad) according to the manufacturer's 
instructions. The PCR protocol consisted of 40 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s and 
annealing/extension at 60 °C for 30 s. For quantification analysis the comparative Threshold Cycle (Ct) 
method was used. The Ct values from each gene were normalized to the Ct value of GAPDH in the same 
RNA samples. Relative quantification was performed using the 2−ΔΔCt method (Schmittgen and Livak, 
2008) and expressed as fold change in arbitrary values. 
 
 11 
 
2.9  Statistical analysis 
One-way ANOVA or Student’s t-test were performed with the Statistical software Statview II (Abacus 
Concepts, CA, USA) to compare (i) vehicle vs. fluoxetine-treated groups, independently in the standard, 
enriched and stressful condition, and (ii) enriched vs. stressful vs. standard condition, in the vehicle 
group, to assess the effect of the environment per se. All mean differences were considered statistically 
significant when p < 0.05.

Results and discussion 
3.1  Fluoxetine affects hippocampal inflammatory mediators 
In order to explore whether fluoxetine effects on inflammation depend on the quality of the living 
environment, we analyzed hippocampal expression levels of seven immune mediators reportedly 
involved in antidepressant drug action (Carvalho et al., 2013; Chen et al., 2010; Eller et al., 2008; 
Hannestad et al., 2011; Kim et al., 2013; Lanquillon et al., 2000; Song et al., 2009; Tuglu et al., 2003) 
and affected by environmental stimuli (Chabry et al., 2015; Goshen et al., 2008; Singhal et al., 2014; 
Wohleb et al., 2011). In particular, we focused on IL-6, TNFα and IL-1β, which are pro-inflammatory 
cytokines among the most studied in relation to antidepressant effects (Carvalho et al., 2013; Eller et 
al., 2008; Hannestad et al., 2011). The expression levels of IFNɣ, which has pro-inflammatory effects 
and pleiotropic activity, and three anti-inflammatory cytokines, IL-10, IL-4 and TGFβ, were analyzed as 
well. 
While hippocampal IL-6 expression was not modified by fluoxetine in both conditions, TNFα and IL-
1β levels were affected by treatment in an environment-dependent fashion. In particular, fluoxetine 
decreased TNFα mRNA expression as compared to vehicle in the stress condition (t = -3.075, p = 
0.0082) but did not affect it in the enriched condition (Fig. 2 A,C). Whereas IL-1β mRNA expression was 
increased by treatment in enrichment (t = 4.714, p = 0.0008) but not affected in stress (Fig. 2 A,C). 
The change in IL-1β mRNA levels was paralleled by concordant modifications of IL-1β precursor and 
mature protein levels (Fig. 2 B,G), fluoxetine-treated subjects showing a decrease in pro-IL-1β (t = -
2.368, p = 0.0281) and an increase in mature IL-1β (t = 2.135, p = 0.0460) in comparison with vehicle. 
No change in protein levels was found in the stressful condition (Fig. 2 D,H). IL-6 and TNFα protein 
levels were not affected by fluoxetine in both conditions (data not shown). IFNɣ expression levels were 
modified by fluoxetine treatment as compared to vehicle only in the stressful condition, treated mice 
showing decreased mRNA levels compared to controls (t= -3.007, p = 0.0109). No significant effect of 
fluoxetine on IL-10, IL-4 and TGFβ was found (Fig. 2 E,F). These findings indicate that fluoxetine 
increases the overall inflammatory milieu in the enriched condition, while exerting an opposite effect in 
the stressful condition. The latter result is in line with previous studies showing that fluoxetine, when 
administered to mice exposed to a stressful environment, overall reduces hippocampal expression of 
 13 
 
pro-inflammatory cytokines (Cheng et al., 2016; Ji et al., 2014; Jiang et al., 2013; Lu et al., 2014; 
Tianzhu et al., 2014; Wilson et al., 2014; Xie et al., 2015).  
The inflammasome is emerging as a key player in mediating the influence of inflammation on the 
vulnerability to psychiatric disorders including MD (Alcocer-Gomez and Cordero, 2014; Alcocer-Gomez 
et al., 2014; Alcocer-Gomez et al., 2015; Miller and Raison, 2015; Pan et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2015). 
High expression of NLRP3 inflammasome and caspase 1 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 
depressed patients has been associated to increased blood concentration of IL-1β, which in turn 
correlates with depression severity (Miller and Raison, 2015). To investigate whether the inflammasome 
complex responsible for the activation of inflammatory processes is differently affected by fluoxetine in 
comparison to vehicle when administered in the enriched or stressful condition, we measured the 
hippocampal expression levels of components of the intracellular NLR inflammasome family. In the 
stressful condition, mice treated with fluoxetine showed decreased mRNA levels of the adaptor 
apoptosis-associated speck-like protein (ASC) common to all inflammasomes, as compared to vehicle (t 
= -3.391, p = 0.0048). By contrast, mice treated in the enriched condition showed increased caspase-
1 mRNA levels (t = 2.679, p = 0.0019). No significant differences were observed in NLRP3, NLRP1, and 
IPAF (NLRC4) mRNAs levels in both conditions (Fig. S1). Overall, these results support a dual effect of 
fluoxetine driven by the quality of the environment and suggest that fluoxetine upregulates 
inflammasome activity in the enriched condition, while exerting opposite effects under stress. 
 
3.2  Microglial modulation by fluoxetine upon environmental stimulation 
Microglial cells represent a potential key player in the brain-immune dialogue since they mediate the 
influence of the inflammatory milieu on neuronal activity and, thus, on behavioral outcome (Bessis et 
al., 2007; Branchi et al., 2014). To evaluate whether microglial function is affected by changes in 
inflammatory markers induced by fluoxetine treatment in the two environmental conditions, we first 
measured the expression of Toll-like receptors (TLRs). These receptors mediate innate immune 
responses to exogenous and endogenous threats (Trotta et al., 2014) and can be triggered in the 
absence of infection (Janova et al., 2015). During inflammatory responses, the membrane-anchored 
CD14 acts as a co-receptor for TLR4, an important regulator of neuroimmune interactions in the 
response to stress and MD (Liu et al., 2014), leading to the downstream release of inflammatory 
 14 
 
modulators such as TNFα and IL-1β (Zhou et al., 2013). We found that fluoxetine treatment, as 
compared to vehicle, increases hippocampal levels of both CD14 and TRL4 mRNAs in the enriched 
condition (t = 3.111, p = 0.0090 and t = 3.204, p = 0.0107, respectively; Fig. S2). Since TLR4 and 
CD14 are mainly expressed by microglial cells in the brain (Lehnardt et al., 2003), these findings suggest 
that fluoxetine treatment in an enriched environment makes microglial cells prone to mount an immune 
response. The expression of these mediators did not differ between fluoxetine treatment and vehicle in 
the stressful condition. 
We next assessed changes in neuron-microglia signaling through the chemokine fractalkine (CX3CL1) 
and its unique receptor CX3CR1 expressed by microglia in the brain, which is known to maintain 
microglial cells in a surveillance state (Paolicelli et al., 2014). Fractalkine signaling was recently found 
to play also a prominent role in mediating the influence of environment on brain function, regulating 
key brain processes such as microglial phagocytosis of synaptic elements and short- and long-term 
neuronal plasticity (Maggi et al., 2011; Milior et al., 2015). We found that, though CX3CR1 receptor 
levels were not affected, hippocampal fractalkine expression was reduced in fluoxetine-treated mice 
compared to vehicle in the stressful condition (t= -3.519; p= 0.0038), suggesting an “activation” or 
phenotypic transformation of microglia induced by the drug when administered in mice exposed to 
stress (Fig. 3 B). No change was found in the enriched condition (Fig. 3 A). 
In order to provide a comprehensive picture of the interaction between fluoxetine and environment 
on inflammatory markers, we investigated the effects of fluoxetine independently from the environment 
and analyzed the expression levels in the whole hippocampus of mice receiving either vehicle or 
fluoxetine in the standard condition. This condition consisted in exposing mice for 14 days to a stressful 
condition in the Intellicage, followed by 21 days of treatment while housed two per cage in standard 
laboratory cages. We found that fluoxetine in the standard condition produced no effect on three 
markers of inflammation, CD14, TRL4 and caspase 1, being the expression levels similar in mice 
receiving treatment or vehicle (Fig. S3).  
As further control, we investigated the effects of the environment per se on inflammatory markers. 
In particular, we compared the expression levels of CD14, TRL4, and caspase 1 measured in the whole 
hippocampus of mice receiving vehicle and exposed to the enriched or the stressful condition. We found 
that, though CD14 did not differ in the two conditions, the levels of TRL4 and caspase 1 were reduced 
 15 
 
in the enriched compared to the stressful condition (t = 2.276, p = 0.0489, t = 3.480, p = 0.0031, 
respectively; Fig. S4). These results show that, in line with the literature (Cheng et al., 2016; Goshen 
et al., 2008; Singhal et al., 2014), the stressful condition increased immune activation compared to the 
enriched condition. 
To investigate the effects of fluoxetine administered in the stressful or enriched condition on 
microglial surveillance state, we evaluated microglial density, distribution and morphology in the CA1 
radiatum through IBA1 immunostaining. This analysis revealed that density was not modified by 
fluoxetine treatment compared to vehicle in both conditions, suggesting marginal proliferation or brain 
infiltration by IBA1-positive myeloid cells (Fig. 3 D,F). This finding is concordant with the lack of effects 
of fluoxetine on IBA1 and CD11b expression in the whole hippocampus (Fig. 3 A). By contrast, microglial 
spacing was affected by fluoxetine, though only in the stressful condition (Fig. 3 E), where it was 
significantly increased by the treatment in comparison to vehicle [F(1, 12) = 6.030, p = 0.0303]. This 
increased microglial spacing indicates the occurrence of unsampled neuropil areas where a reduced 
surveillance could compromise the brain response to endogenous and exogenous challenges. Microglial 
morphology was overall not affected in the enriched condition (Fig. 3 C). However, fluoxetine treatment 
increased cell body area [F(1, 148) = 5.062, p = 0.0259] and decreased arborization area [F(1, 148) = 
3.991, p = 0.0476] compared to vehicle in the stressful condition. The morphological index, 
standardizing the size of microglial cell body to the arborization area, was increased as well [F(1, 148) 
= 10.645, p = 0.0014; Fig. 3 I]. These changes suggestive of immune “activation” have been classically 
associated to a pro-inflammatory profile (reviewed in (Walker et al., 2014) as during aging (Bachstetter 
et al., 2011; Tremblay et al., 2012). By contrast, here we found that such microglial modifications are 
associated to an anti-inflammatory profile, prompting to revisit this simplistic association between 
microglial structure and function, as already suggested (Walker et al., 2014). Such alternative 
association between microglial morphological changes and an anti-inflammatory function is increasingly 
reported. For instance, noradrenergic signaling, which is notably enhanced by fluoxetine treatment, has 
been shown to increase microglial expression of anti-inflammatory mediators, while inducing microglial 
process retraction, reducing surveillance and promoting phagocytosis (Gyoneva and Traynelis, 2013; 
Heneka et al., 2010).

3.3  Fluoxetine modulates microglial phenotype in an environment dependent manner  
Different activation states of microglia are characterized by a wide variety of phenotypic markers, 
including cytokines, chemokines, surface receptors and metabolic enzymes that lead to a pro or anti-
inflammatory action (Franco and Fernandez-Suarez, 2015). In order to investigate how the interplay 
between the environment and fluoxetine treatment affects microglial phenotype and to assess whether 
resident immune cells contribute to the inflammatory changes measured in the whole hippocampus, we 
isolated and analyzed CD11b+ cells. Considering that peripheral immune cells infiltration appears to be 
marginal in our model, the CD11b+ population should mainly comprise microglia. RT-PCR analysis in 
CD11b+ cells revealed that, compared to vehicle, fluoxetine treatment administered in the enriched 
condition led to a pro-inflammatory profile, increasing pro-inflammatory and decreasing anti-
inflammatory-related genes expression (Fig. 4). In particular, iNOS (t = -2.965, p = 0.041), cd86 (t = -
6.399, p < 0.001), IL-15 (t = -3.925, p = 0.008), IL-1β (t = -2.675, p = 0.038) and IL-23 (t = -7.343, 
p <0.001) mRNA levels were increased, while arg-1 (t = -3.059, p = 0.022), ym-1 (t = -5.547, p = 
0.005), IL-10 (t= -5.201, p = 0.002), IL-1ra (t = -3.151, p = 0.025) were reduced compared to vehicle 
(Fig. 4 A,B). Interestingly, an opposite effect was found when fluoxetine treatment was administered in 
the stressful condition, which produced a clear shift towards an anti-inflammatory profile. Specifically, 
Arg-1 (t = -4.042, p = 0.007), cd206 (t = -2.783, p = 0.032), ym-1 (t = -2.961, p = 0.042), TGFβ (t = 
-2.605, p = 0.040), socs3 (t = -2.963, p = 0.031), IL-10 (t = -4.117, p = 0.006), IL-1ra (t = -3.752, p 
= 0.009), fizz-1 (t = -3.051, p = 0.022) mRNA levels were increased, while iNOS (t = -5.535, p = 
0.005), TNFα (t = -3.217, p = 0.018), IL-1β (t = -3.917 p = 0.008), IL-6 (t = -2.934, p = 0.026) and 
IL-23 (t = -3.366, p = 0.015) levels were decreased compared to vehicle (Fig. 4 D,E).  
TNFα and IL-1β were modulated by fluoxetine in the whole hippocampus and in isolated microglial 
cells in a similar fashion, suggesting that microglia participate in setting the hippocampal levels of these 
cytokines. Moreover, in the stress condition, the fluoxetine-induced reduction in the whole hippocampus 
levels of IFNɣ, a main cytokine leading to pro-inflammatory microglial response, was concordant with 
the increased expression of anti-inflammatory markers in CD11b+ cells. Among these, iNOS, which is 
deeply involved and upregulated in the inflammatory response (Ghosh et al., 2016), was markedly 
reduced upon fluoxetine treatment. In the enriched condition, the fluoxetine-induced increase of TLR4 
and CD14 levels in the whole hippocampus is in line with the expression of pro-inflammatory-related 
 17 
 
genes in CD11b+ cells. It is worth noting that in the stressful condition, microglial IL-6 expression is 
affected by treatment in an opposite fashion as compared to the expression of other pro-inflammatory-
related genes. Previous studies have already found unique IL-6 expression profile compared to that of 
other pro-inflammatory cytokines in response to stressful (Audet et al., 2010) or immunogenic stimuli 
(Skelly et al., 2013). In addition, IL-6 has been reported to produce unexpected effects when used to 
modulate a variety of physiological processes, such as memory function (Arnold et al., 2002; Yirmiya 
and Goshen, 2011). Therefore, the functional role of IL-6 modulation by fluoxetine warrants further 
investigation.  
We measured the effects of fluoxetine independently from the environment by analyzing the 
expression of pro- and anti-inflammatory-related genes in hippocampal CD11b+ cells from mice 
receiving either vehicle or fluoxetine in the standard condition. The results show that, contrary to 
subjects exposed to the enriched condition, those exposed to the standard condition display a microglial 
expression profile overlapping with that shown by mice exposed to the stressful condition, suggesting 
that, when administered to individuals first exposed to stress and afterwards treated in standard 
laboratory cages, fluoxetine produces effects overlapping with those produced in individuals kept in a 
stressful condition before and during treatment (Fig. 4 C,F). In particular, Arg-1 (t = 10.000, p = 0.029), 
cd206 (t = -7.085, p = 0.001), ym-1 (t = -6.929, p = 0.001), TGFβ (t = 10.000, p = 0.029), IL-10 (t = 
-2.588, p = 0.041), IL-1ra (t = -7.173, p < 0.001) and fizz-1 (t = -10.435, p < 0.001) mRNA levels were 
increased by treatment, while TNFα (t = 3.301, p = 0.021), IL-1β (t = 4.151, p = 0.009), IL-6 (t = 
26.000, p = 0.029) and IL-15 (t = 12.680, p < 0.001) levels were decreased compared to vehicle. The 
only exception concerned socs3, an anti-inflammatory marker, which was increased by fluoxetine 
treatment (t = 7.655, p < 0.001).  
In order to assess whether, independently from treatment, the environment affected inflammation 
in microglia, we measured the expression levels of pro- and anti-inflammatory related genes in 
hippocampal CD11b+ cells of mice exposed to the standard, enriched or stressful condition. We found 
that, in line with previous studies (Chabry et al., 2015; Wohleb et al., 2011), enrichment led to an anti-
inflammatory while stress led to a pro-inflammatory profile compared to the standard condition (Fig. 5). 
In particular, mice housed in the enriched condition showed reduced levels of IL-6, IL-23 and TGFβ (t 
= 37.494, p < 0.0001, t = 14.051, p < 0.0001, t = 43.000, p <0.0001, respectively) accompanied by 
 18 
 
increased levels of IL-1Ra and IL-10 (t -8.014, p = 0.0002, t = -5.123, p = 0.0022, respectively) 
compared to mice housed in the standard condition. In addition, mice housed in the enriched condition 
showed reduced levels of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-23 and TGFβ (t = -3.091, p = 0.0214, t = -3.802, p = 0.0191, 
t = -5.044, p = 0.0023, t = -5.044, p < 0.0001, respectively) and increased levels of IL-1Ra and IL-10 
(t = 8.271, p = 0.0002, t = 5.28, p = 0.0019, respectively) compared to mice housed in the standard 
condition. Finally, mice housed in the stressful condition showed increased levels of IL-1β (t = -3.842, 
p = 0.0085), and reduced levels of IL-1Ra (t = 22.093, p < 0.0001) compared to mice housed in the 
standard condition. 
Overall, these results support the undirected susceptibility to change hypothesis and show that 
fluoxetine induces an anti- or pro-inflammatory profile depending on the quality of the environment.

Conclusion 
The main finding of the present study is the divergent effect of fluoxetine treatment, as compared 
to vehicle, in the enriched and stressful conditions on the expression levels of inflammatory markers in 
the whole hippocampus and isolated microglial cells, accompanied by changes in microglial surveillance. 
In particular, in line with the literature and our hypothesis, treatment in a stressful condition overall led 
to an anti-inflammatory response (Cheng et al., 2016; Ji et al., 2014; Jiang et al., 2013; Lu et al., 2014; 
Tianzhu et al., 2014; Wilson et al., 2014; Xie et al., 2015). By contrast, fluoxetine treatment in an 
enriched condition led to an increased expression of inflammatory genes. To our knowledge, this is the 
first study investigating the effects on the inflammatory response of antidepressants administered in an 
enriched environment. It is worth noting that, in order to assess the effects of treatment in individuals 
showing a depression-like phenotype, we administered fluoxetine to mice previously exposed to chronic 
stress. Such pre-exposure activates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, increasing corticosterone 
levels (Alboni et al., 2016; Milior et al., 2015), and likely affects the interaction among the drug, the 
brain and immune system, making the results not applicable to different circumstances. However, this 
procedure has been chosen because it reproduces the clinical condition of patients who, before receiving 
the treatment, already show depressive symptoms and have high levels of cortisol (Juruena et al., 
2009). The results concerning the neural and behavioral response of the same subjects tested in the 
present study have been published elsewhere (Alboni et al., 2016) and show that the effect of treatment 
depends on the quality of the environment.  
Preclinical (Alboni et al., 2016; Branchi et al., 2013) and clinical (Cohen et al., 2006; Trivedi et al., 
2006) studies have already shown that the effects of SSRIs are dependent on the quality of the living 
environment. In particular, it has been shown that SSRI treatment amplifies the influence of the 
environment on depressive symptomatology. Therefore, fluoxetine administration in a favorable 
environment promotes the reduction of symptoms, while in a stressful environment it may even lead to 
a worsened prognosis (Branchi, 2011). The key role of the environment in SSRI action has been shown 
also for other endpoints, such as vulnerability to obesity (Mastronardi et al., 2011; Wong and Licinio, 
2001). Therefore, the environment acts as a moderator (Kraemer et al., 2006), driving treatment 
outcome. 
 20 
 
The dual effect of fluoxetine on inflammatory markers here reported may explain the apparent 
discrepancy present in the literature. Indeed, though many studies showed that antidepressants have 
anti-inflammatory effects (Basterzi et al., 2005; Kagaya et al., 2001; Lanquillon et al., 2000; Leo et al., 
2006; Tuglu et al., 2003; Yoshimura et al., 2009), an increasing number of studies are reporting a pro-
inflammatory action (Chen et al., 2010; Haastrup et al., 2012; Hannestad et al., 2011; Jazayeri et al., 
2010; Kim et al., 2013; Song et al., 2009). In addition, the bi-directional crosstalk between SSRI 
administration and inflammation has been described also by studies investigating the effects of anti-
inflammatory drugs on antidepressant efficacy. Indeed, experimental and clinical studies have shown 
that anti-inflammatory drugs, such as celecoxib or aspirin, can either improve (Akhondzadeh et al., 
2009; Andrade, 2014; Brunello et al., 2006) or impair treatment outcome (Warner-Schmidt et al., 2011). 
Though we found that fluoxetine effects on inflammation are driven by the quality of the environment, 
we often did not observe a match in the markers modified by treatment in the enriched and stressful 
conditions. For instance, IL-1β levels in the whole hippocampus were increased in the enriched, but not 
affected in the stressful condition. By contrast, other parameters, such as microglial surveillance state, 
were modified only when the drug was administered in the stressful environment. This suggests that 
the mechanisms underlying the anti- or pro-inflammatory action of SSRIs may differ. It should also be 
noted that studies describing antidepressant effects on inflammation, though showing similar overall 
pro- or anti-inflammatory effects, often report differences in the nature of the individual cytokines 
affected by treatment. For instance, some studies report a decrease of IL-1β expression following 
fluoxetine administration in mice exposed to stress (Cheng et al., 2016; Lu et al., 2014), while others 
do not (Wilson et al., 2014). The variable SSRI effects on cytokine levels have also been described in 
the peripheral inflammatory markers of depressed patients (Jazayeri et al., 2010; Song et al., 2009). 
Here we show that the effects of the antidepressant treatment on inflammatory markers depend on 
the environment. However, at variance with the endophenotypes of MD, where treatment amplifies the 
influence of the environment, fluoxetine affects the inflammatory response counteracting the effects of 
the environment (Alboni et al., 2016). Indeed, fluoxetine administration, increasing and decreasing 
inflammatory markers respectively in the enriched and stressful condition, produced an effect opposite 
to that caused by enrichment and stress per se (Chabry et al., 2015; Goshen et al., 2008; Singhal et 
al., 2014; Wohleb et al., 2011). The analysis of the interplay among SSRI, plasticity and inflammation 
 21 
 
provides a potential explanation for such unexpected effect of fluoxetine treatment. Indeed, neural 
plasticity requires inflammatory responses to be kept within a tightly controlled range. Brain plasticity 
processes, such as learning and memory, neurogenesis, neuronal excitability and synaptic scaling are 
dependent on the highly regulated interaction among microglia, cytokine production and neurons 
(Yirmiya and Goshen, 2011). Consequently, any deviation from such range, caused either by immune 
activation or suppression, results in plasticity impairment (Hewett et al., 2012; Santello and Volterra, 
2012; Yirmiya and Goshen, 2011). Therefore, it can be hypothesized that since fluoxetine enhances 
neural plasticity (Branchi, 2011; Ruiz-Perera et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2008), fluoxetine keeps 
inflammation within a range that is permissive for plasticity. It is important to highlight that present 
results comprise mainly mRNA transcript levels. Therefore, further analyses devoted to measure protein 
levels are warranted to provide a comprehensive picture of the effects of the environment in driving the 
effects of SSRI on inflammation. 
In conclusion, the present findings further confirm the complexity of the crosstalk among 
antidepressant effects, inflammatory processes and microglial activity. This is moderated by quality of 
the living environment, suggesting a possible explanation for the inter-individual differences in SSRI 
action and effects. The increased understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying this interplay 
may allow for more effective personalization of antidepressant treatment strategies based on the quality 
of the living environment of the depressed patient.

stress to induce a depression-like phenotype.  
 
Figure 2. Fluoxetine effects on inflammatory markers in the whole hippocampus. In the 
enriched condition, we found (A) increased levels of IL-1 mRNA, (B) decreased protein levels of pro 
IL-1 and increased levels of mature IL-1. (C) TNF- expression was reduced by fluoxetine treatment 
in mice treated in the stressful condition. (D) IL-1 protein level was not affected in the stressful 
condition. (E) No significant effect was found for IFN-ɣ, IL-10, IL-4 and TGFβ mRNA levels in the 
enriched condition. (F) By contrast, IFN-ɣ mRNA levels were lower in mice treated in the stressful 
condition. Representative blots of pro- and mature- forms of IL-1, and their relative β-tubulin bands,

Figure 3. Microglial surveillance state in the hippocampus. (A) In the enriched condition, 
IBA1, CD11b, CX3CR1 and CX3CL1 mRNAs levels were not modified by fluoxetine treatment. However, 
(B) in the stressful condition, the expression of CX3CL1 was significantly reduced in fluoxetine treated 
mice with respect to their control. Results of RT-PCR analysis are shown as fold increases relative to 
vehicle. Gene expression data are expressed as mean + S.E.M. (n = 8 per group). * p<0.05 vs. relative

spacing index (square of the average NND multiplied by microglial density), cell body area, arborization 
area and morphological index (cell body area over arborization area) were not altered by fluoxetine 
treatment. (D, F) By contrast, in the stressful condition, the spacing index and cell body areas were 
increased, the arborization area was decreased and the morphological index was increased in fluoxetine 
treated mice. Representative images of IBA1-stained microglia from the four experimental groups, 
captured at low (10X) or high magnification (40X), are respectively shown in (G, H) and (I, J).

Figure S1. Fluoxetine effects on the expression of inflammasome components in the whole 
hippocampus. (A) In the enriched condition, fluoxetine treatment increased caspase 1 mRNA levels but 
did not affect the expression of other inflammasome components. (B) In the stressful condition, ASC mRNA 
levels were reduced in fluoxetine treated mice compared to the relative control. No difference in 
transcriptional levels of NLRP3, NLRP1, NLRC4 were found between mice receiving fluoxetine or vehicle. 
Results are shown as fold changes relative to vehicle. Data are expressed as mean + S.E.M. (n = 8 per 
group). * p<0.05 vs. relative vehicle treated group.

Figure S2. Fluoxetine affects expression of CD14 and TRL4. (A) In the enriched condition, increased 
mRNA levels of CD14 and TRL4 were found in fluoxetine treated mice compared to vehicle. (B) In the 
stressful condition, no significant effect was observed. Results are shown as fold changes relative to vehicle. 
Data are expressed as mean ± S.E.M. (n = 8 per group). * p<0.05 vs. relative vehicle treated group.

Figure S3. Modifications in inflammatory markers in the whole hippocampus of mice receiving 
either vehicle or fluoxetine in the standard condition. Treatment did not affect CD14, TRL4, and 
Caspase 1 levels, compared to vehicle. Results are shown as fold changes relative to vehicle. Data are 
expressed as mean + S.E.M. (n=4 per group). * p<0.05 vs. relative vehicle treated group.

Figure S4. Effects of the environment on the expression of inflammatory markers. Though CD14 
levels did not differ between the two conditions, the expression levels of mRNAs encoding TRL4and Caspase 
1 were reduced in mice housed in the enriched condition. Results are shown as fold changes relative to the 
stress condition. Data are expressed as mean + S.E.M. (n=6 per group). * p<0.05, ** p<0.01 vs. mice 
housed in the stressful condition.
