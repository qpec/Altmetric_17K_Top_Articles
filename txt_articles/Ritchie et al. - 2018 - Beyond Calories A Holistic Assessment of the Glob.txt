The global food system is failing to meet nutritional needs, with growing concerns for
health related to both under-, over-consumption and severe micronutrient deficiency. The
2nd Sustainable Development Goal (SDG2) targets the end of malnutrition in all forms
by 2030. To address this challenge, the focus around food security and malnutrition
must be broadened beyond the scope of sufficient energy intake to take full account
of total nutrient supply and requirements. Here, for the first time, we have quantitatively
mapped the global food system in terms of energy, protein, fat, essential amino acids,
and micronutrients from “field-to-fork,” normalized to an equitable per capita availability
metric. This framework allows for the evaluation of the sufficiency of nutrient supply,
identifies the key hotspots within the global food supply chain which could be targeted for
improved efficiency, and highlights the trade-offs which may arise in delivering a balanced
nutritional system.

INTRODUCTION
Global Malnutrition Burden
The global food system is currently failing to meet the nutritional needs of a growing human
population (FAO et al., 2015; FAO, 2017b). The standard measure of poor nutrition—caloric
hunger—indicates that 795 million (one-in-nine) people were undernourished in 2014–2016
(FAO, 2017b). The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)’s most recent analysis suggests that
under business-as-usual (BAU) progress, by 2030, 653 million people will remain undernourished
globally (FAO, 2017b). These metrics, however, severely underestimate the scale of the challenge
in delivering a nutritionally-sufficient diet for everyone (Sukhdev et al., 2016). Malnutrition
exists in various forms beyond insufficient energy intake: it’s estimated that approximately one
billion people suffer from protein deficiency (Wu et al., 2014); one-third of under-5 s are stunted
(low height-for-age; Ahmed et al., 2012); more than two billion suffer from micronutrient
deficiencies (also known as “hidden hunger”; von Grebmer et al., 2014); and paradoxically two
billion adults are classified as overweight or obese, with strong links to an alarming rise in the
prevalence of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), such as type-II diabetes and heart disease
(International Food Policy Research Institute, 2016). This challenge exists across countries of all
income levels, with a growing number of developing nations experiencing a “triple burden”—
an increase in the prevalence of obesity in parts of the population alongside the wide prevalence
of undernourishment and micronutrient deficiencies (Alexandratos and Bruinsma, 2012). The
widespread and multifaceted nature of malnutrition not only comes at a severe social cost, but also
an economic one. It’s estimated that malnutrition could negatively impact global gross domestic
product by 10% per year (Horton and Steckel, 2011).
 Ritchie et al.
Holistic Assessment of Food Systems
The Millennium Development Goals largely limited measures
of malnutrition to energy undernourishment (United Nations,
2001). The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have
broadened this perspective to include the ambition to end all
forms of malnutrition (SDG2) by 2030 (United Nations, 2015a),
making this challenge inclusive of all countries at all income
levels. Whilst the importance of nutrition is exemplified in the
second SDG (SDG2), malnutrition forms a core component of
many of the other SDGs, with highly relevant indicators in gender
equality, healthy life, poverty, reducing inequality, education,
peace and justice, and growth and employment (International
Food Policy Research Institute, 2016). The co-dependence of
agriculture and environment means it is also tightly linked
to Goals 13–15, concerned with climate change, oceans and
terrestrial ecosystems. In particular, global food production must
adapt to environmental change, but also play a key role in climate
change mitigation (IPCC, 2014).
The inadequacy of a caloric-based outlook to, by itself,
address these challenges has led to recent calls for a major
reframing of our global approach to malnutrition and food
research (Haddad et al., 2016; Sukhdev et al., 2016). A few
fundamental components emerge as crucial to this shift: the
food system must be reviewed with the inclusion of all essential
nutritional elements; holistically, across the full agricultural and
food value chain to identify entry points for change; and with
relevant metrics which can be more widely understood and
communicated.
Research Aims
Here, for the first time, we have mapped the global flow of
all essential nutritional components—including energy, protein,
fat, micronutrients (essential vitamins and minerals), and amino
acids—from “field-to-fork,” assuming per capita equity (i.e.,
utilizing an average per capita metric) availability. This was
quantified drawing upon the FAO’s Food Balance Sheets (FBS)
for 2011 (the latest complete dataset available; FAO, n.d.), FAO
regional commodity waste estimates (FAO, 2011b); and FAO and
the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) nutrient
databases (FAO, 2001, 2016; USDA, 2016; see Methods).
This analysis serves several purposes. Firstly, by measuring
average nutrient intakes relative to recommended requirements,
it reviews the capacity with which the current food system
could sufficiently nourish the current global population through
equitable distribution. Secondly, it identifies the key system
inefficiencies, which can be compared both across stages of the
value chain and across nutrients, to better understand the entry
points which can be targeted for improved efficiency. These entry
points may differ between macro- and micronutrients, making a
holistic analysis crucial to recognizing the trade-offs and balance
in optimizing both. This will allow for further quantification
and analysis of the capacity of the food system to meet growing
nutritional demands through time, and SDG targets by 2030.
Whilst this has been evaluated previously in the form of caloric
supply (Cassidy et al., 2013; BajŽelj et al., 2014), this discussion
must be extended to all essential nutrients if SDG2 is to be met.
There are three core components necessary to deliver an
effective food system for everyone:
(1) a sufficient range of food items necessary for a diet of
balanced nutritional quality must be produced and available
for consumption at the household level;
(2) a sufficient range of commodities must be regionally and
locally accessible for consumers;
(3) a diverse range of nutritious products must be affordable for
consumers at all income levels.
Our analysis primarily focuses on the first of these three
components. By normalizing to an average per capita metric,
such an analysis fails to capture the global inequalities in nutrient
availability and intake which exist, and that are reflected in the
latter two components. However, the framework utilized in this
study holds merit in its replicability: it can be easily scaled for use
at a range of levels including regional, national or local contexts.
In this case, such analyses can prove effective in assessing the
capability of national food systems or trade to meet domestic
nutritional requirements.
METHODS
Nutrient Availability Estimates
The global food system was mapped from crop production
through to per capita food consumption using FAO Food Balance
Sheets (FBS) from its FAOstats databases (FAO, n.d.). FBS
provide quantitative data (by mass) on production of food items
and primary commodities, and their utilizations throughout the
food supply chain. Such data are available at national, regional
and global levels. To maintain consistency and ensure use of the
best-available data throughout the analysis, FAO data have been
utilized at all possible stages. Food Balance Sheet data for 2011
have been used, these being from the latest full dataset available.
Food Balance Sheets provide mass quantities across the supply
chain. In this analysis, we include all stages of the supply
chain available within the FBS (with exception of post-harvest
losses and wastage, which are further disaggregated as described
in section Food Wastage Estimates): crop production, exports,
imports, stock variation, re-sown produce, animal feed, other
non-food uses, and food delivered to households. Data on all
edible food items and commodities across all food groups are
included within these balances; a full list of included commodities
are detailed in Supplementary Table 1. In calculation of animal
feed production in the form of oilcakes, FAO figures were
normalized to primary crop equivalents based on cake-to-crop
conversion factors applied by Davis and D’Odorico (Davis and
D’Odorico, 2015).
In order to estimate the total nutrient value in the eight supply
chain stages above, mass quantities of each food commodity
(for example, tons of wheat, rice, soyabeans) were multiplied
by energy (kcal), fat and protein content of each key food
item/commodity (for example, 350 kilocalories per 100 g; FAO,
2001). This therefore gives the total quantity of kilocalories,
grams of protein and fat at each stage of the global supply chain.
Food Wastage Estimates
FBS provide a single value of supply chain losses for each
commodity—grouped as a single category “losses.” Here we

Holistic Assessment of Food Systems
have attempted to provide food loss and waste figures by
specific stage in the supply chain. Our disaggregated food
loss figures have been calculated based on the commodity-
specific regional percentages provided in other FAO literature
(FAO, 2011b). These percentage figures break food losses down
across seven commodity groups and five supply chain stages
(agricultural production, post-harvest handling and storage,
processing and packaging, distribution and consumption). The
applied percentage values by commodity type and supply chain
stage are provided in Supplementary Table 2. Food losses at each
of the five loss or wastage stages were therefore first estimated
by region (using mass quantities and percentage loss figures by
region), and summed in order to derive a global figure.
It’s important to note that the FAO FBS report final
nutrient figures as “food availability”—these figures have not
been corrected for consumption wastage, meaning they often
overestimate final consumption. In this study we have attempted
to correct for consumption-level wastage by applying the
“consumption” commodity-specific percentage loss figures (one
of the five stages of loss and wastage defined above) and
subtracting from “food availability” figures. This provides a more
precise indication of food availability—here, we have referred to
final food availability as “residual food availability.”
Corrections for Protein Quality, Amino Acid
and Micronutrient Availability
Protein quality is a key concern for many developing nations
as a result of a predominance of grain-based diets, with grains
tending to have poorer digestibility and amino acid (AA)
profiles than animal-based products and plant-based legume
alternatives(Swaminathan et al., 2012; Wu, 2016). Whilst cereal-
dominant diets may meet total protein requirements, protein
intake is often of poor quality and insufficient to meet actual
nutritional requirements (Bouis et al., 2011).
Taking full account of protein quality impacts would require
quantification based on the FAO’s recommended Protein
Digestibility Corrected Amino Acid Score (PDCAAS) and, more
recently, the Digestible Indispensable Amino Acid (DIAA) score
(WHO/FAO/UNU Expert Consultation, 2007; FAO, 2011a).
These scoring systems calculate protein quality based on a
food’s most limiting AA. Although ideal for the assessment
of protein quality in individual food items, and occasionally
applied for analysis of simple dietary composition, PDCAAS and
DIAA methods present significant challenges when applied to
an aggregate of 100+ food items—limiting AA’s, for example,
can cancel out between different food items (FAO, 2011a). To
best quantify limitations in protein quality, protein intakes have
therefore been corrected for digestibility using FAO digestibility
values (World Health Organization, 1991), with amino acid
profiles analyzed separately. The production and distribution
of individual indispensable amino acids (FAO, 2011a) were
quantified using FAO and USDA composition databases (FAO,
2016; USDA, 2016).
The sufficiency and requirements of AA intake is measured
differently to that of macro- and micronutrients. Whilst the latter
are measured in terms of total consumption, AAs are quantified
relative to grams of protein intake (mg amino acid per gram
of total protein; WHO/FAO/UNU Expert Consultation, 2007).
An amino acid is considered to be “limiting” if its relative (mg
g protein−1) quantity falls below its AA-specific requirement.
When this occurs, protein synthesis cannot proceed beyond the
rate at which the limiting AA is available (FAO, 2011a). In other
words, overall protein utilization (the total quantity of protein
used in the body) is only as effective as its limiting AA. Since
amino acid limitation is defined based on AA contents per gram
of protein, the relative AA values were calculated using the total
protein content at each supply chain stage.
In a similar manner to macronutrients, micronutrients were
quantified at each stage of the food chain by multiplying
mass quantities of specific commodities by their equivalent
micronutrient contents from FAO INFOODS (FAO, 2016)
composition and USDA nutrient databases33. It’s important to
note that our study attempts to quantify the average supply
and availability of nutrients through the commodity chain—
micronutrients can additionally be lost through processes such
as cooking (World Health Organization, 2005), impacting on
the true level of consumption in individuals. These additional
losses are difficult to quantify. As such, we might consider our
results to be an upper estimate on micronutrient availability. In
this analysis, we have selected eight micronutrients which are
typically analyzed in nutritional assessment: calcium, iron, zinc,
folate, and vitamins A, B6, B12, and C.
It should be noted that this analysis considers only natural
micronutrient sources within the commodity chain. Vitamins
and minerals are frequently added to food products at the
processing stage (Miller and Welch, 2013). This food fortification
process is widely implemented across many developed nations,
and can be an essential source of key micronutrients. Such
practices are, however, largely absent across most developing
nations where natural dietary sources of micronutrients are also
likely to be lowest.
Assessment of Nutritional Sufficiency
For consistency, and to provide a better understanding of the
food system down to the individual level, all metrics have been
normalized to average per person per day (pppd) metric—this
was calculated by dividing total nutrient contents by 2011 global
population figures from UN population data (United Nations,
2015b). This therefore provides an average value, assuming
equitable distribution across the population.
In order to assess the capacity of the global food system to
deliver sufficient nutrients for all, this average pppd nutrient
availability was compared relative to energy, macronutrient,
amino acids and micronutrient recommended requirements.
We acknowledge that nutritional requirements vary significantly
between individuals depending on gender, age, size, and levels
of activity—this study is unable to capture such heterogeneity.
However, it does provide an important comparison of equitable
average availability and average recommended requirement.
In this study we have defined caloric requirements by the
World Health Organization’s (WHO’s) minimum threshold of
2,100 kcal pppd (UNHCR/UNICEF/WFP/WHO, 2004) and 50 g
pppd of protein (World Health Organization, 1991). Daily

Holistic Assessment of Food Systems
requirements for fatty acids are less straightforward to determine,
relative to energy or protein—there is no widely-agreed figure
for total fat requirements for adequate nutrition (FAO/WHO,
2008). A commonly adopted recommended level of fat intake in
national dietary guidelines is 70 g pppd of total fat (FAO, 2017a),
however this should not be interpreted as absolute requirements
in the manner of energy or protein. The resolution of food
balance sheet data does not allow us to adequately quantify the
availability to the level of specific fatty acids. As a result, although
we have mapped pathways of total fat availability through the
food system in a similar manner to energy and protein, we
have not here attempted to quantity the prevalence of potential
insufficiency.
Micronutrient Estimated Average Requirement (EAR) values
were used to determine recommended dietary requirements.
EAR is defined as the median required intake and is based on the
assertion that nutrient intake and requirements are independent;
the distribution of requirements falls symmetrically around the
EAR value; and the distribution of nutrient intakes is much larger
than that of requirements (World Health Organization, 2005).
Micronutrient requirements—in contrast to some dietary needs
such as energy, which have larger inter-individual variabilities in
requirement—meet these criteria. Individuals which fall below
the EAR value are deemed to be at risk of deficiency. This
means that in order to ensure global requirements are met, all
intakes must surpass the EAR (not just the average intake). WHO
guidelines (World Health Organization, 2005; WHO/FAO/UNU
Expert Consultation, 2007) and recommended demographic
requirements for calculation of global population EARs (for
individuals >12 months of age) have been followed using UN
age and gender demographic data (United Nations: Department
of Social Economic Affairs, 2013). Full data on EARs by age
and gender group, and population weightings are provided in
Supplementary Tables 3, 4. Individuals which fall below EAR
values are defined as being at risk of deficiency.
Amino acid requirements and sufficiency are more complex
to assess since they are dependent on total protein intake. Here
we have derived a population-weighted average requirement
based on AA-specific concentration requirements by age
and demographic data. UN age and gender demographic
data is provided in Supplementary Table 3. AA requirements
by age are provided in Supplementary Table 5, and are
taken from WHO recommendations (WHO/FAO/UNU Expert
Consultation, 2007). WHO estimates are derived assuming
individuals’ total protein intake meets requirements for their
body mass (i.e., they meet the grams of protein per kilogram of
body mass requirement).
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Energy and Macronutrients
The three nutrient pathways (energy, protein and fat) from
agricultural production through to food eaten are shown in
Figures 1A–C.
Caloric pathways in the food system are the most well-
documented to date. Our analysis indicates an average global
per capita availability of 2,687 kcal pppd in 2011, well above
the minimum requirements of 2,100 kcal pppd. Our figure is
slightly lower than the FAO’s reported average caloric supply
of 2,869 kcal pppd (FAO, n.d.), since we have attempted to
estimate residual availability after correction for wastage at the
consumption level. This is in contrast to FAO figures, which
reports food available for consumption, without correction for
wastage at the consumer level (FAO, 2001). This result—that
globally we produce more than enough to meet current energy
needs if equitably distributed—is already well-established (Foley
et al., 2011; Cassidy et al., 2013; BajŽelj et al., 2014). Our
analysis provides further support for this conclusion. In reality,
an estimated two billion overconsume, and close to 800 million
are left undernourished (International Food Policy Research
Institute, 2016).
Results of this analysis suggest that, once corrected for
digestibility, average protein availability was 63 g pppd. Despite
surpassing the 50 g pppd minimum requirement, the distribution
of intakes around this average value is likely to be larger
than that of energy; the unit costs of protein are generally
higher than that of carbohydrates or fats, making protein
more income-dependent than energy intake (Drewnowski, 2010).
This is particularly important for many developing nations
where consumption of animal-based products and plant-based
alternatives such as pulses are often low (Dror and Allen, 2011;
Varadharajan et al., 2013). Protein quality is an important factor
to consider in evaluating whether intake is sufficient. Studies
often report that average regional or national intakes meet 50 g
pppd requirements (Ranganathan et al., 2016), however, there are
examples of low- and middle-income countries—such as India—
where dominant protein sources are cereal- or plant-based, where
average intake can fall below this requirement once digestibility
has been considered (Ritchie et al., 2018).
Our analysis suggests that, with equitable distribution,
availability of fat would have been 105 g pppd in 2011—well
above the 70 g pppd typically recommended in national dietary
guidelines (FAO, 2017a). It is well-established that individual
intakes of dietary fat are often in excess of recommended
guidelines, particularly in developed nations (FAO, n.d.). This is
of concern from a health perspective, with strong links between
dietary fat intake, obesity and NCDs such as heart disease
and stroke (Bray et al., 2004; Malik et al., 2013). However,
it’s also important to acknowledge the physiological role of
fat in nutritional outcomes, and the negative health impacts
which can occur through inadequate consumption. Fat plays
an important role in the absorption of key micronutrients
(FAO/WHO, 2008); low fat intake, as remains the case in
many developing nations (FAO, n.d.), therefore serves to
exacerbate cases of micronutrient deficiency which are prevalent
in low-income communities (Brown et al., 2004; White et al.,
2017). The large variations in global intakes of fat therefore
have important health implications at both ends of the
spectrum.
Whilst the availability of macronutrients at the household
level is of prime importance, the average supply of energy, protein
and fat are generally well understood (FAO et al., 2015; FAO,
n.d.). Of greater interest for building future food resilience and
more sustainable food systems is to understand the complete food

The pathways of energy, digestible protein and fat from “field-

are important to consider when defining potential entry points
for change. All chains experience severe losses across the value
chain, with losses of 54, 56, and 31% in energy, digestible protein
and fat, respectively. The three nutritional components show

Holistic Assessment of Food Systems
similar patterns of loss in stages we would define as supply chain
losses (harvesting, post-harvest, processing, distribution, and
consumption) with moderate losses at all stages, and the highest
in the harvesting phase. As has been previously documented,
such patterns will be regionally variable and income-dependent,
with major losses at the post-harvest stage in developing nations,
and more wastage at the consumer level in higher-income
households (Lipinski et al., 2013).
The dominant losses occur in the allocation of edible crops
toward non-food uses and animal feed. This is where the
pathways between nutrients differ. The diversion of both energy
and fat to non-food uses are much larger than that of digestible
protein. The largest commodities utilized for non-food purposes
are in the form of oils and cereals. This is an expected result due
to large allocation of these commodities for the production of
biofuels and industrial products such as cosmetics, construction
and polymer materials (Foley et al., 2011; Lu et al., 2011). The
re-allocation of oils and cereals explains the comparably larger
losses of energy and fat vs. digestible protein (which is in low
concentration in cereals, and absent in liquid oil component of
oilcrops; FAO, 2001).
The largest loss of energy and digestible protein occurs in
the re-allocation of crops for animal feed. This is in contrast
to fat, which generates a net surplus in the production of
animal-based fats. Our analysis suggests that approximately
1,500 kcal and 70 g of digestible protein pppd is diverted for
feed. Whilst some energy and protein is converted and re-
enters the system in the form of meat and dairy products,
both experience a significant net loss in this conversion process
(Figures 1A,B). Cereals, roots, and high-quality protein crops
such as soybeans form the largest sources of animal feed, which
explains the basis of this loss. It is important to note that
the complete nutrient flow in this process is not captured
through mapping edible food energy content alone; there are
also significant energy and protein inputs in the form of grazing,
pasture and fodder (land use for animal production is estimated
to account for approximately 75% of total agricultural land;
Foley et al., 2011).
Amino Acids
Our
analysis
has
mapped
the
aggregate
amino
acid
concentrations of all indispensable AAs by stage in the supply
chain (Table 1). The amino acid profile is of lower importance
where digestible protein availability is above requirements
(as shown in Figure 1). However, in particular national or
local settings where protein intake is below requirements,
such analysis could help to identify where particular AAs
are deficient, and where in the food chain they are produced
or lost.
At the level of global food consumption, no AAs are
deemed to be limiting in the average global diet. However,
we have highlighted lysine as the amino acid of particular
concern. As is clearly demonstrable in our analysis, and has
been widely discussed within the literature (WHO/FAO/UNU
Expert Consultation, 2007; Swaminathan et al., 2012), there is
a significant contrast in the lysine concentration of plant- and
animal-based products. The lysine concentration of aggregate
commodities in the crop production and harvest phases of
the supply chain is notably lower than the latter stages, where
animal-based products are introduced. Whilst the average diet is
not lysine-deficient, if meat and dairy products were removed,
the global food system would be severely lysine-limited. At
the crop production level, the average lysine concentration is
36.6 mg g protein−1, much lower than the required value of
46.1 mg g protein−1. The only component of the crop-based
system for which the overall lysine concentration is above this
requirement—and only marginally, at 46.9 mg g protein−1–is the
portion allocated for animal feed.

Holistic Assessment of Food Systems
This finding is important for several reasons. Diets low
in intakes of animal-based products—especially those limited
for economic reasons (where higher-quality alternatives such
as pulses and legumes are not widely consumed) are likely
to be lysine-limited. After correction for protein digestibility,
this limitation further reduces the level of utilizable protein
consumed in low-income settings (WHO/FAO/UNU Expert
Consultation, 2007).
It also has important implications for the promotion of
more sustainable plant-based diets. It’s widely acknowledged
that the resource footprints of animal-based products are
typically higher than crop-based alternatives (Tilman and
Clark, 2014), driving efforts for the adoption of more plant-
based or vegetarian dietary habits (Ranganathan et al., 2016).
However, our analysis suggests that our current food system
would be severely lysine-limited in the absence of meat and
dairy products. Although feed conversion in the production
of livestock is inefficient—with large losses of energy and
digestible protein—it is essential within our current food system
to meet lysine requirements. This does not imply that a
global shift toward a plant-based diet could not meet these
requirements, however, a major shift in overall agricultural
production toward more protein-based crops such as pulses
and legumes would be necessary. Since the energy content
of these commodities is typically lower than that of staple
carbohydrate crops (FAO, 2001; USDA, 2016), the displacement
of agricultural land used for cereal production may result in
an overall reduction in total global caloric output. This is an
important balance to assess in meeting the caloric, protein and
lysine requirements of a growing population. This makes the
extension of future analyses beyond caloric production even
more essential.
Micronutrients
The pathways of individual micronutrients are presented in
Figures 2A–C, 3A–C, 4A,B. As shown, all micronutrients meet
their EAR in the global average availability. However, there
are several micronutrients for which this is marginal. For
example, the average availability of calcium is 953 mg pppd
relative to 877 mg pppd requirements. Similarly, the availability
of folate is only marginally higher than its EAR (with an
intake of 313 µg ppd vs. 299 µg ppd requirements). This
would be sufficient if diets were perfectly equitable, however,
large geographical variations in dietary availability—especially in
micronutrients which, like digestible protein, are typically more
income dependent than caloric supply (Drewnowski, 2010)—
mean that many will consume well below EARs.
Micronutrient pathways demonstrate a trade-off similar to
calorie, protein and lysine balances in relation to livestock
production. As shown (Figures 2–4), the largest supply chain
losses of several micronutrients (folate, zinc, iron, vitamin A and
calcium) occur in the allocation of crops to animal feed. Whilst
this highlights an important inefficiency in the food system, it’s
essential in the production of vitamin B12, for which animal-
based products are the only dietary source (Wu et al., 2014). This
dependence on meat and dairy products is likely to leave many
individuals at risk of deficiency (especially in calcium, iron, zinc,
folate vitamin A, C, and B-vitamins), especially those in lower
income groups.
Our results indicate that the magnitude of total micronutrient
loss from “field-to-fork” is typically higher than that of
macronutrients. All micronutrients assessed in this study—with
the exception of vitamin B12–experience total losses of over 60%.
In the case of folate, this inefficiency reaches 71%. This result is
a reflection of the large losses and wastage of highly perishable
foods, such as fruits, vegetables and animal-based products (FAO,
2011b).
Data Limitations
The challenge in developing accurate Food Balance Sheets (FBS)
at the national and global level are widely acknowledged and
discussed by the FAO (FAO, 2001). The accuracy of FBS is
constrained by the completeness and reliability of commodity
production and utilization statistics in national records.
Food loss and waste figures, especially in countries where
small-holder farms and local markets are prevalent, has a high
level of uncertainty. To our knowledge, statistics on supply
chain losses and waste down to the national level are not
widely available, particularly at the resolution of commodity and
chain stage breakdown. For this reason, published commodity-
specific FAO figures on regional losses have been applied in
this study (Supplementary Table 2). A reliance on aggregated
regional values reduces the resolution to which supply chain
losses can be quantified, and introduces an additional degree of
uncertainty.
Where data within FBS are deemed to be incomplete or
inconsistent, the FAO draw upon judgements from national
expert opinion and technical expertise to provide as reflective
coverage as possible in its FBS. Whilst likely to provide a close
approximation, this is rarely 100% accurate.
Nonetheless, the FBS is currently the best available data
source for construction and analysis of the complete commodity
chain. Literature is available based on studies conducted at the
household level (Swaminathan et al., 2012), however, very few
studies attempt to provide coverage of the food chain dynamics
from crop production through to human consumption, especially
on a global basis as in the present study. Without a complete
overview of the commodity chain, the impacts of interventions
(such as improved food management and storage; trade; reduced
allocation of crops to non-food uses; improved crop yields) are
almost impossible to assess.
As the FAO notes, food balance sheets “provide an
approximate picture of the overall food situation in a country and
can be useful for economic and nutritional studies, for preparing
development plans and for formulating related projects” (FAO,
2001). In this study, we have therefore relied on FAO datasets in
order to construct a high-level overview of the global commodity
chain to assess its overall capacity to meet nutritional demands
at present. This overview will not be perfect in a statistical sense,
however these issues are global in scale and hence we deem the
analysis to be appropriate to inform broad policy focus and assess
the potential of supply chain interventions.
Improved agricultural, food waste and nutritional reporting
would allow for more robust estimates to be constructed. Such

data collection will be important in informing future policy and
allowing for forward planning in this sector. It should therefore
be an area of renewed focus for global food and nutritional
assessment in the coming years.

This study has attempted to holistically map the global food
commodity and nutrient system from agricultural production

through to food eaten—a system which is complex, and in
some cases, poorly quantified. To maintain methodological
consistency, we have utilized FAO FBS, regional waste and
nutrient composition data as far as possible—the FAO is
currently the only data repository from which such a global
analysis can be sourced. The uncertainty around FBS and
waste data is fully acknowledged by the FAO (FAO, 2001).
As such, we acknowledge that our analysis is not perfect in a
statistical sense (see section Data Limitations), however, it is
currently the best estimate of the global food nutrient system
to date.
Our analysis further highlights the importance of extending
food and nutrient analysis beyond the scope of caloric supply—
complex trade-offs arise in sufficient production of energy,

optimizing these intervention options to meet context-specific
deficiencies is vital in reducing the scale of global nutrient
deficiency.
Despite providing an important global overview of the overall
food system, this analysis has limitations in its effectiveness
at capturing regional, national and local system dynamics.

That said, this framework is highly replicable—FAO data exist
at regional and national levels—and can be scaled for more
context-specific nutritional analysis. Such scalability will allow
for better coverage of the dietary inequalities which exists both
between and within countries.
