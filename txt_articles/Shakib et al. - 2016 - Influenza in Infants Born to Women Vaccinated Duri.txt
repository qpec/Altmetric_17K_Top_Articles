abstract
BACKGROUND: Infants <6 months old with influenza are at risk for adverse outcomes. Our 
objective was to compare influenza outcomes in infants <6 months old born to women who 
did and did not report influenza vaccine during pregnancy.
METHODS: The study included all women who delivered from 12/2005 to 3/2014 at 
Intermountain facilities and their infants. Influenza outcomes included infant influenza-like 
illness (ILI), laboratory-confirmed influenza, and influenza hospitalizations.
RESULTS: The cohort included 245 386 women and 249 387 infants. Overall, 23 383 (10%) 
pregnant women reported influenza immunization. This number increased from 2.2% 
before the H1N1 pandemic to 21% postpandemic (P < .001). A total of 866 infants <6 months 
old had ≥1 ILI encounter: 32 (1.34/1000) infants born to women reporting immunization 
and 834 (3.70/1000) born to women who did not report immunization (relative risk 
[RR] 0.36; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.26–0.52; P < .001). A total of 658 infants had 
laboratory-confirmed influenza: 20 (0.84/1000) born to women reporting immunization 
and 638 (2.83/1000) born to unimmunized women (RR 0.30; 95% CI, 0.19–0.46; P < .001). A 
total of 151 infants with laboratory-confirmed influenza were hospitalized: 3 (0.13/1000) 
born to women reporting immunization and 148 (0.66/1000) born to unimmunized women 
(RR 0.19; 95% CI, 0.06–0.60; P = .005).
CONCLUSIONS: Self-reported influenza immunization during pregnancy was low but increased 
after the H1N1 pandemic. Infants born to women reporting influenza immunization during 
pregnancy had risk reductions of 64% for ILI, 70% for laboratory-confirmed influenza, and 
81% for influenza hospitalizations in their first 6 months. Maternal influenza immunization 
during pregnancy is a public health priority.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Infants <6 
months old with infl
 uenza are at risk for adverse 
outcomes. Current guidelines recommend 
immunizing pregnant women to protect young 
infants against infl
 uenza. Few studies have evaluated 
the effect of maternal immunization during 
pregnancy on infant infl
 uenza outcomes.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: Infants born to women 
reporting infl
 uenza immunization during pregnancy 
had risk reductions in laboratory-confi
 rmed 
infl
 uenza and infl
 uenza hospitalizations in their fi
 rst 
6 months. Maternal infl
 uenza immunization during 
pregnancy to protect young infants against infl
 uenza 
is a public health priority.

Influenza is a common vaccine-
preventable illness responsible 
for substantial morbidity and 
mortality in children.1, 
2 The burden 
of influenza disease is particularly 
high in infants <6 months old.3, 
4 
Attempts to protect infants from 
influenza during their first 6 months 
through direct immunization 
have been unsuccessful because 
of an insufficient infant immune 
response.5–7 Providing passive 
protection of the infant through 
maternal immunization is an 
alternative to direct immunization.
The Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention (CDC) Advisory Committee 
on Immunization Practices, American 
Academy of Pediatrics, and American 
Congress of Obstetricians and 
Gynecologists (ACOG) have endorsed 
the importance of immunizing 
pregnant women to protect young 
infants against influenza.8–11 The 
most recent ACOG committee opinion 
on influenza immunization during 
pregnancy states that “maternal 
immunity is the only effective strategy 
in newborns.”9
Several prospective studies have 
demonstrated a reduction in 
both influenza-related illness and 
laboratory-confirmed influenza in 
infants born to women receiving 
influenza vaccine during pregnancy. 
A 2008 randomized trial in Bangladesh 
demonstrated a 63% reduction in 
laboratory-confirmed influenza and 
a 29% reduction in the incidence of 
febrile respiratory illness in infants 
born to mothers who received third 
trimester influenza vaccine.12 A 
2010 US observational cohort study 
demonstrated a reduced risk for 
clinical or laboratory-confirmed 
influenza infection in the infants 
for up to 6 months after maternal 
immunization during pregnancy.13 
A population-based surveillance study 
conducted in children hospitalized 
with fever or respiratory symptoms 
during the 2002 to 2009 influenza 
seasons found a 45% to 48% 
reduction in laboratory-confirmed 
influenza hospitalizations among 
infants whose mothers reported 
influenza immunization during 
pregnancy.14 Most recently, a 
randomized placebo-controlled trial 
of HIV-negative pregnant women 
and their infants in South Africa 
demonstrated vaccine efficacy rates 
in infants of 48.8% (95% confidence 
interval [CI], 11.6–70.4) after maternal 
immunization.15 In contrast, published 
results from large retrospective 
studies of maternal immunization 
during pregnancy have not supported 
the reduction in infant influenza-
related outcomes demonstrated in 
prospective studies.16, 
17
Intermountain Healthcare, the largest 
vertically integrated system of health 
care facilities in the Intermountain 
West, has a postpartum immunization 
policy and queries women about 
influenza vaccine status on admission 
for delivery. We recognized the 
opportunity to use the electronic 
medical records of Intermountain 
Healthcare to identify the proportion 
of delivering women reporting 
influenza vaccine in pregnancy and 
compare influenza outcomes in the 
first 6 months in infants born to 
women who did and did not report 
influenza vaccine in pregnancy.
METHODS
Protection of Human Subjects
Approval to conduct this study was 
granted by the institutional review 
boards of the University of Utah and 
Intermountain Healthcare in Salt 
Lake City, Utah. A waiver of informed 
consent was granted by both 
institutions.
Identifi
 cation of Pregnant Women 
and Their Infants and Reported 
Maternal Infl
 uenza Vaccine Status 
From the Intermountain Enterprise 
Data Warehouse
More than 30 000 deliveries occur 
at Intermountain facilities each 
year. Intermountain facilities are 
categorized into 4 geographic regions 
of Utah and Idaho: Urban Central: 
Salt Lake County (population 1.08 
million); Urban North: Weber, Cache, 
Box Elder, and Cassia counties 
(population 378 759); Urban South: 
Utah, Millard, Sanpete, and Sevier 
counties (population 1.73 million); 
and Southwest: Washington, Garfield, 
and Iron counties (population 
46 780). All Intermountain facilities 
share a single electronic medical 
record database that captures 
clinical and administrative data. 
Data are stored in the Intermountain 
Enterprise Data Warehouse. To 
retrospectively identify reported 
influenza vaccine administration 
during pregnancies occurring over 
9 influenza seasons from December 
1, 2005 through March 31, 2014, we 
created a pregnancy episode table 
that included all women who had at 
least ≥1 International Classification 
of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical 
Modification (ICD-9-CM) diagnosis 
code associated with pregnancy.
All Intermountain facilities administer 
an intake survey for women as they 
enter the labor and delivery unit that 
includes a question about influenza 
immunization during the current 
pregnancy. The data are recorded 
in the electronic medical record. 
We used this information to define 
maternal influenza immunization 
status for the pregnancy. The 
electronic medical records for infants 
born during the study period and 
discharged from the hospital after the 
delivery encounter were identified 
and linked to maternal records.
Infant Infl
 uenza Outcomes
We ascertained the following infant 
influenza-related outcomes in the 
first 6 months after delivery at an 
Intermountain facility: proportion 
of infants with ICD-9-CM codes 
consistent with ≥1 episode 
of influenza-like illness (ILI); 
laboratory-confirmed influenza 
by culture, polymerase chain

reaction (PCR), or direct fluorescent 
antibody (DFA); and laboratory-
confirmed influenza hospitalizations. 
Laboratory-confirmed respiratory 
syncytial virus (RSV) infection was 
also ascertained in infants born to 
women who did and did not report 
influenza immunization to evaluate 
the specificity of maternal influenza 
immunization on infant outcomes.
Although outpatient testing is 
at the discretion of the clinician 
at Intermountain facilities, viral 
respiratory testing is recommended 
for all children hospitalized with 
acute respiratory illnesses and 
for febrile infants <90 days old. 
From 2005 to 2008, DFA-negative 
specimens were submitted for viral 
culture. From 2009 to 2011, DFA-
negative specimens were tested by 
PCR (Luminex xTAG Respiratory 
Virus Panel; Luminex Diagnostics, 
Austin, TX). Beginning in 2011, 
respiratory specimens were initially 
tested by multiplex PCR (FilmArray 
Respiratory Panel; BioFire 
Diagnostics, Salt Lake City, UT).
Statistical Analysis
Data were analyzed with Stata 
(version 13.1; Stata Corp, College 
Station, TX). Descriptive statistics 
were used to characterize the 
proportion of women who reported 
receiving influenza vaccine during 
pregnancy and the maternal–infant 
record linkage. Maternal age was 
compared by t test, and the χ2 test was 
used to compare maternal insurance 
type, maternal residence location 
(urban versus rural or frontier), and 
delivery hospital region by reported 
maternal influenza immunization 
status. Maternal comorbidities were 
compared in women who did and did 
not report influenza immunization via 
the Elixhauser index, a comorbidity 
index comprising a comprehensive 
set of 30 comorbidities defined with 
ICD-9-CM codes from administrative 
data.18 Relative risk (RR) and 95% 
CI were used to compare immunized 
and unimmunized mothers across the 
primary infant outcomes of interest: 
presence of ILI, laboratory-confirmed 
influenza, and hospitalization with 
laboratory-confirmed influenza. 
A multivariable Poisson regression 
model with robust error variance 
was used to compare the RR of infant 
influenza-related outcomes based on 
maternal influenza vaccine status, 
adjusted for maternal characteristics 
including age, birth month, insurance 
type, residence location, and 
hospital region.19 We assessed effect 
modification by testing interaction 
terms for each of the maternal 
characteristics with immunization 
status.
RESULTS
Study Subjects and Maternal–Infant 
Record Linkage
There were 262 364 deliveries 
resulting in 263 347 live births 
during the study period. Maternal 
and infant records were successfully 
linked for 249 387 (95%) live 
births in which the infant was 
discharged from the hospital after 
the delivery encounter, and this 
became the cohort for all analyses. 
This maternal–infant cohort included 
23 847 infants born to 23 383 women 
who reported receiving influenza 
vaccine during the current pregnancy 
episode and 225 540 infants born 
to 222 003 women who did not 
report influenza vaccine at time of 
admission for delivery.
Self-Reported Infl
 uenza 
Immunization During Pregnancy
In the cohort, 23 383 women (10%) 
reported receiving influenza vaccine 
during the current pregnancy episode 
at time of admission for delivery. 
Mean maternal age was statistically 
but not clinically different for women 
reporting receiving influenza vaccine 
compared with women who did not 
report receiving the vaccine (28.1 
years [SD 5.2] vs 27.6 years [SD 
5.1]; P < .001). Pregnant women 
who had government insurance 
or no insurance, resided in a rural 
or frontier location, or delivered 
at hospitals in the Urban South or 
Southwest regions were less likely 
to report immunization during 
pregnancy (P < .001) (Table 1). In the 
maternal cohort, 58 282 pregnant 
women had comorbidities by ICD-
9-CM diagnosis: 6317 (26.5%) 
women who reported influenza 
immunization compared with 
51 965 (23.0%) who did not report 
immunization (RR = 1.15; 95% 
CI, 1.12–1.18; P < .001). The rate 
of prematurity was not different 
between the groups (1.6% in infants 
born to women reporting influenza 
immunization vs 1.7% in infants 
born to mothers not reporting 
immunization; P = .051). Birth weight 
was also not statistically or clinically 
different between infants born to 
women who did and did not report 
receiving influenza vaccine, with a 
difference of 7 g (3303 vs 3296 g, 
respectively; P = .068).
The study period encompassed both 
waves of the H1N1 pandemic (April 
2009–August 2010). The proportion of 
pregnant women reporting influenza 
vaccine at time of delivery increased 
significantly during and after the H1N1 
pandemic, fell slightly during the 
seasons that followed, and increased 
markedly beginning in 2013, with 
>50% reporting influenza vaccine in 
the most recent influenza season 
(Fig 1). The proportion of women 
reporting influenza vaccine during 
pregnancy in the cohort increased 
from 2.2% (range 1.7%–2.8%) over 
the 4 influenza seasons before the 
HIN1 pandemic to 21% (range 5.6%–
52%) over the 5 seasons including 
and after the pandemic (P < .001).
ILI in Infants
A total of 866 infants had ≥1 ILI 
encounters in the first 6 months after 
delivery: 32 (1.34/1000) infants 
born to women reporting influenza 
immunization during a pregnancy 
episode at time of delivery and 834 
(3.70/1000) born to women who did

not report influenza immunization 
(RR 0.36; 95% CI, 0.26–0.52; P < .001).
There were 241 infants in the cohort 
with ≥1 ILI encounter associated 
with hospitalization. In the 
hospitalized cohort, 4 (0.17/1000) 
infants were born to women 
reporting influenza immunization 
during pregnancy, compared with 
237 (1.05/1000) born to women 
who did not report influenza 
immunization during pregnancy (RR 
0.16; 95% CI, 0.06–0.43; P < .001)
Laboratory-Confi
 rmed Infl
 uenza in 
Infants
We identified 658 infants with 
laboratory-confirmed influenza in 
the first 6 months after delivery: 
20 (0.84/1000) born to immunized 
women and 638 (2.83/1000) born to 
women who did not report influenza 
immunization (RR 0.30; 95% CI, 
0.19–0.46; P < .001). There were 16 
infants (0.67/1000) in the cohort 
with laboratory-confirmed influenza 
A born to pregnant women who 
reported receiving influenza vaccine, 
compared with 524 (2.32/1000) 
in infants born to mothers who did 
not report receiving the vaccine (RR 
0.29; 95% CI, 0.18–0.47; P < .001). 
Similarly, 4 (0.17/1000) infants 
with laboratory-confirmed influenza 
B in the infant cohort were born 
to pregnant women who reported 
influenza immunization versus 116 
(0.51/1000) infants born to women 
who did not report immunization (RR 
0.33; 95% CI, 0.12–0.88; P = .028).
Of the 658 infants with laboratory-
confirmed influenza, 151 (23%) 
were hospitalized. In the hospitalized 
cohort, 3 (0.13/1000) infants 
were born to women reporting 
immunization and 148 (0.66/1000) 
born to women who did not report 
immunization (RR 0.19; 95% CI, 
0.06–0.60; P = .005). Although there 
were 136 documented infant deaths 
in the first 6 months after delivery 
in this retrospective cohort, no 
infant death was associated with any 
influenza-related diagnosis.
In contrast to influenza outcomes, 
we identified no differences in RSV 
infection in infants born to women 
who received influenza vaccine. 
We identified 5439 infants with 
laboratory-confirmed RSV in the 
cohort: 504 (2.1%) infants born to 
mothers who reported immunization 
during pregnancy and 4935 (2.2%) 
infants born to women who did not 
report receiving the vaccine (RR 0.97; 
95% CI, 0.88–1.06; P = .453).
With respect to the infant outcomes 
of interest, in multivariable Poisson 
regression with robust error variance 
adjusting for age, birth month, 
insurance type, residence location, 
and hospital region, the protective 
effect of influenza immunization 
remained significant, and the 
magnitude of RR changed little from 
the univariate analysis (Table 2). 
None of these maternal variables 
were found to be effect modifiers on 
infant outcomes of interest including 
infant ILI, hospitalized ILI, laboratory-
confirmed influenza, or hospitalized 
laboratory-confirmed influenza.
DISCUSSION
This study reports infant influenza 
outcomes in a large cohort of infants 
born to women self-reporting 
influenza immunization during 
pregnancy before and after the H1N1 
pandemic. The overall proportion

of pregnant women reporting 
influenza immunization was low but 
increased significantly after the H1N1 
pandemic. Infants born to pregnant 
women who reported receiving 
influenza vaccine during pregnancy 
were significantly less likely to have 
documented health care encounters 
associated with ILI (64% reduction), 
and they had a 70% reduction in 
laboratory-confirmed influenza and 
an 81% reduction in hospitalization 
with laboratory-confirmed influenza. 
Furthermore, in this mother–infant 
cohort, 97% of all laboratory-
confirmed influenza cases occurred 
in infants born to women who did not 
report receiving influenza vaccine 
during pregnancy.
Only 10% of women in this cohort 
spanning 9 influenza seasons 
reported influenza immunization, but 
the proportion of pregnant women 
reporting influenza immunization 
increased significantly after the H1N1 
pandemic, with a more pronounced 
recent increase, reaching a high of 
52% in the 2013 to 2014 influenza 
season. Nationally, prepandemic 
H1N1 National Health Interview 
Survey seasonal influenza coverage 
estimates for 2008 to 2009 were 
only 11%.20 During the 2009 to 
2010 flu season, reported seasonal 
influenza immunization coverage 
among pregnant women increased to 
32.1% as measured by the National 
2009 H1N1 Flu Survey and 47.1% 
as measured by the Pregnancy Risk 
Assessment Monitoring System.16, 
17 
National vaccination coverage of 
pregnant women has remained 
relatively stable since the 2010 
to 2011 season, with reported 
immunization coverage during 
pregnancy of 34.6% during the 
2013 to 2014 influenza season.18, 
19 
We observed a similar pattern. The 
higher rates in recent seasons may be 
associated with efforts by ACOG and 
CDC to improve influenza coverage in 
pregnant women. However maternal 
influenza immunization rates during 
pregnancy remain suboptimal.
In our cohort we also found that 
demographic characteristics differed 
between pregnant women who 
did and did not report receiving 
the influenza vaccine. Uninsured 
pregnant women and those with 
government insurance were less 
likely to report receiving influenza 
immunization during pregnancy. 
A recent Massachusetts Pregnancy 
Risk Assessment Monitoring System 
survey demonstrated that pregnant 
women who received Medicaid or 
whose household income was at or 
below the federal poverty level were 
significantly less likely to report 
receiving the seasonal influenza 
vaccine.21 Pregnant women living in 
areas classified as rural or frontier or 
who received their care in the Urban 
South or Southwest Intermountain 
regions were also significantly less 
likely to report immunization. The 
Intermountain Urban South region 
includes Utah County, 1 of 30 US 
counties with the largest estimated 
numbers of unvaccinated children 
from 1995-2001 CDC National 
Immunization Surveys (NIS) data.22 
It is possible that factors leading to 
parental vaccine hesitancy in children 
may similarly affect pregnant 
women considering maternal 
immunization during pregnancy. 
We also documented that women 
with underlying medical conditions 
were more likely to receive influenza 
immunization. These women may 
have been recognized as having high 
risk for influenza complications by 
their providers and therefore been 
encouraged to receive influenza 
vaccine. Interventions that target 
both healthy pregnant women and 
those with chronic conditions are 
needed to increase vaccine uptake.
Infants born to women who reported 
receiving the influenza vaccine 
during pregnancy in our cohort 
were significantly less likely to have 
a diagnosis of or be hospitalized 
with ILI or laboratory-confirmed 
influenza. Several previous 
retrospective studies have not 
successfully demonstrated protection 
against influenza disease in infants. 
A retrospective study over 5 
influenza seasons (1997–2002) 
concluded that infants born to 
women who received influenza 
immunization during pregnancy 
had an equal risk for influenza or 
pneumonia admissions and ILI 
compared with infants born to 
unimmunized women.16 Another 
retrospective cohort study conducted 
from 1995 to 2001 by the CDC 
Vaccine Safety Datalink found no 
reduction in medical visits for 
respiratory illness among infants 
of women receiving influenza 
immunization during pregnancy 
compared with infants born to 
unimmunized women.2, 
17 These 
previous studies were performed in 
smaller cohorts over fewer influenza 
seasons and did not examine 
laboratory-confirmed influenza 
diagnoses in infants. Earlier studies 
have also demonstrated that ILI 
can be an insensitive predictor of 
laboratory-confirmed influenza 
infection, particularly in young 
children, leading to misclassification 
bias.23 ILI at Intermountain facilities 
is reported with an influenza-
specific ICD-9-CM diagnostic code 
algorithm that correlates well with 
laboratory-confirmed influenza, 
which may reduce misclassification 
in our study.24 More importantly, the

widespread use of respiratory viral 
diagnostic testing in young infants 
for many years at Intermountain 
outpatient facilities allowed us to 
examine the impact of maternal 
influenza immunization status 
on infant laboratory-confirmed 
influenza and hospitalization for 
laboratory-confirmed influenza. 
Strikingly, the receipt of influenza 
vaccine had no effect on RSV 
outcomes, increasing confidence 
that the administration of influenza 
vaccine during pregnancy resulted 
in specific benefits for infant health 
outcomes related to influenza.
The results of this large retrospective 
study support the conclusions 
of prospective studies regarding 
the protective benefit of maternal 
influenza immunization during 
pregnancy. The morbidity and 
mortality associated with influenza in 
infants have been well described.25, 
26 
Our study strengthens the evidence 
that maternal immunization provides 
passive protection against influenza 
to infants during the vulnerable 
period before they are old enough to 
receive active immunization.
One of the strengths of our study is 
our ability to systematically identify 
self-reported influenza vaccine in a 
large retrospective cohort of pregnant 
women presenting for delivery. 
It is possible that self-reported 
influenza immunization at time of 
delivery is limited by recall bias. 
We believe that maternal recall of 
receipt of influenza vaccine is likely 
to be accurate. In an earlier study 
conducted in Intermountain facilities, 
we demonstrated that maternal 
recollection of receiving intrapartum 
antibiotics was 85% accurate and 
that the 15% of women whose recall 
differed from the medical record were 
as likely to overreport as underreport 
receiving treatment.27 In our study 
of influenza vaccine, if women who 
did or did not receive the vaccine 
were misclassified, the results would 
have been biased toward the null 
hypothesis.
Another strength of our study was 
the success of the maternal–infant 
record linkage. Our ability to link most 
of the maternal–infant pairs in our 
cohort allowed us to capture infant 
influenza-related outcomes through 
6 months by using ICD-9-CM codes. 
The widespread use of viral diagnostic 
testing in the Intermountain system 
is another strength of our study and 
allowed accurate classification of 
infants with influenza.
Our study has several limitations. 
Maternal influenza immunization 
was self-reported and overall low 
during the study period compared 
with current immunization rates in 
pregnant women. Because maternal 
immunization status could be 
confirmed only by self-report at 
time of delivery, we do not know 
the exact timing of immunization, 
which limited our ability to accurately 
predict the exact timing and duration 
of protection afforded to the infant by 
influenza season or year of maternal 
immunization. Furthermore, we did 
not know the specific influenza strains 
women were vaccinated against in 
our cohort and were therefore unable 
to match the maternal vaccine strain 
with the influenza strain observed 
in the infants, as is typically done in 
prospective vaccine trials designed to 
measure vaccine efficacy. However, 
despite low maternal immunization 
rates and the inherent limitations 
of retrospective self-reported 
immunization data, ours was 1 of the 
largest retrospective maternal–infant 
cohorts to date.
Finally, many potential unmeasured 
factors may have influenced the 
magnitude of the risk of influenza 
infection in the infants. It is possible 
that some of the benefits to the infant 
attributed to maternal immunization 
may have resulted from the benefit of 
cocooning from household contacts 
immunized against influenza or from 
disease prevention and care-seeking 
behaviors in women who did and did 
not report immunization. Health care 
provider decision-making regarding 
testing infants for influenza may also 
have been influenced by the provider’s 
awareness of maternal immunization 
status. Variations in vaccine 
effectiveness over time may also 
have influenced the risk of influenza 
infection in infants. Despite these 
limitations, the significant decrease 
in the burden of influenza illness in 
infants born to women who reported 
receiving influenza immunization 
during pregnancy is reassuring. 
Our results also support the need 
to incentivize system-level efforts 
to improve influenza immunization 
coverage rates in pregnant women, 
particularly in those with government 
insurance or no insurance.
CONCLUSIONS
Self-reported influenza immunization 
during pregnancy was low but 
increased after the H1N1 pandemic. 
Despite low maternal immunization 
rates, infants born to women 
reporting influenza immunization 
during pregnancy had a reduction 
in risk of 64% for ILI, 70% for 
laboratory-confirmed influenza, and 
81% for influenza hospitalizations 
in their first 6 months. Protecting 
young infants from influenza through 
maternal immunization during 
pregnancy is a public health priority.
