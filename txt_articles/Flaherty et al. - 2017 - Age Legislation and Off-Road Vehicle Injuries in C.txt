BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: In 2010, the Massachusetts Legislature passed a comprehensive 
law that restricted off-road vehicle (ORV) use by children <14 years old and regulated 
ORV use by children up to the age of 18 years. We aimed to examine the impact of the 2010 
Massachusetts law on the rates of ORV-related injuries.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed of Massachusetts emergency department 
(ED) and inpatient discharges between 2002 and 2013 as found in the Center for Health 
Information and Analysis database by using external causes of injury codes specific to 
ORV-related injuries. Yearly population-based rates were compared before and after the 
implementation of the law (2002–2010 vs 2011–2013) by using Poisson regression analysis 
and segmented regression.
RESULTS: There were 3638 ED discharges and 481 inpatient discharges for ORV-related 
injuries in children across the 12-year study period. After the implementation of the law, 
the rate of ED discharges declined by 33% in 0- to 9-year-olds, 50% in 10- to 13-year-olds, 
and 39% in 14 to 17-year-olds (P < .0001). There was no significant decline in ED discharges 
for 25- to 34-year-olds. Inpatient hospital discharges were also reduced by 41% in 0- to 
17-year-olds after implementation (P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS: As compared with adults (ages 25–34 years), the population-based ORV-related 
injury rate of residents <18 years old significantly declined after the passage of legislation 
that imposed age restrictions and other safeguards for youth riders.

 Off-road vehicles (ORVs) pose a 
significant injury risk to children. 
ORVs are motorized vehicles with 
3 or more wheels designed for use 
over off-road terrain, including 
all-terrain vehicles (ATVs) and 
side by sides (SxSs), which include 
both utility terrain vehicles and 
recreational off-highway vehicles.1, 
 
2 
ATVs are typically 4-wheeled ORVs 
with handlebars for steering and 
seats intended to be straddled by 
the driver. They have high centers of 
gravity and can achieve high speeds, 
making them unstable and unsafe 
for children.3 There have been more 
than 3000 ATV-related pediatric 
fatalities in the United States over the 
past 3 decades, with 12- to 15-year-
olds accounting for more than half 
of these deaths.4 There were also 
∼360 000 emergency department 
(ED) visits for children younger 
than 15 years old for ATV-related 
injuries between 2001 and 2010.5, 
 
6 
SxSs were involved in 335 fatalities 
and 506 injuries over a similar time 
frame, with drivers younger than 16 
years old contributing to >50% of the 
incidents.1, 
 
2 The significant morbidity 
and mortality associated with the 
use of ORVs by children has led to 
medical societies, legislators, and 
health care providers advocating for 
federal safety standards and injury 
prevention legislation.3, 
5, 
 
7, 
 
8
ORV injury prevention efforts 
began in the late 1980s when 
the Consumer Product Safety 
Commission (CPSC) and members of 
the ATV industry entered a 10-year 
consent decree that included the 
banning of 3-wheeled vehicles, a free 
nationwide training program offered 
to purchasers of new ATVs, and age 
recommendations for ATV use.4, 
 
9 
The American Academy of Pediatrics 
(AAP) also became involved in 
1987 with its first policy statement 
calling for several safety measures, 
including the prohibition of ATV use 
by children younger than 14 years 
old.10 This statement was followed 
by the introduction of a model bill for 
legislators that further called for age 
restrictions up to 16 years of age.11 
The end of the 10-year CPSC decree 
in 1998 saw a dramatic increase 
in hospitalizations for and deaths 
from ATV-related pediatric injuries.3 
By 2014, 44 states had responded 
to the rising injuries by enacting 
some form of legislation restricting 
the use of ORVs under certain age 
ranges or conditions.12, 
 
13 Many of 
these regulations had a questionable 
impact on pediatric injuries.8, 
 
14 
– 
18  
Recent data from the CPSC 
demonstrated an overall slow decline 
in ATV-related fatalities since 2007 
only to be superseded by another 
worrisome upward trend beginning 
in 2013.19
In October 2010, 4 years after the 
ORV-related fatality of an 8-year-
old child, the Commonwealth of 
Massachusetts enacted legislation 
further restricting ORV use. An Act 
Regulating the Use of Off-Highway 
and Recreational Vehicles, or "Sean’s 
Law, 
" amended Massachusetts 
General Laws Chapter 90b Sections 
21 to 35 and imposed the strictest 
statewide age restrictions for 
ORV riding in the United States. 
The new legislation applied to the 
operation of ATVs and “recreational 
utility vehicles, 
” which are further 
described as SxSs and other 
nonmotorcycle ORVs. The law 
banned children 13 years old and 
younger from riding an ORV on 
public or private land unless “directly 
supervised by an adult on parent’s 
land while in preparation for, or 
while participating in, a sanctioned 
race, rally or organized event which 
has been approved by a municipal 
permitting authority.” The law 
went further by limiting children to 
vehicles with engine displacements 
<90 cm3. Children 14 to 17 years of 
age were mandated to take education 
and training classes and to be 
directly supervised by an adult while 
operating nonmotorcycle ORVs. The 
law continued helmet requirements, 
banned driving while under the 
influence of alcohol, increased 
penalties for adults who allow their 
children to ride ORVs, and required 
vehicles to be registered with the 
state. It also called for the creation 
of an “Off-Road Vehicle Advisory 
Committee” to aid in the enforcement 
of the new regulations.
The Massachusetts law was the 
first to conform to nearly all the 
recommendations made by the 
AAP in its model bill and is based 
on recommendations made by 
professional societies, including the 
AAP, American College of Surgeons, 
the American Academy of Orthopedic 
Surgeons, and the American Pediatric 
Surgical Association.11, 
 
20 
– 
22 Because 
no similar laws have yet been 
analyzed, the objective of our study 
was to determine the overall impact 
of the 2010 Massachusetts ORV law 
by investigating population-based 
rates of ED visits and inpatient 
hospital discharges for ORV-related 
injuries in children <18 years of age 
before and after the legislation’s 
implementation.
MethODs
The study was reviewed by the 
Massachusetts General Hospital 
Institutional Review Board and 
deemed exempt.
study Period
The study period extended from 
January 2002 to December 2013, 
9 years before and 3 years after 
the 2010 ORV law. The following 
2 time periods were defined: the 
prelaw period (2002–2010) and 
the postlaw period (2011–2013). 
We included injuries from the time 
of the law’s enactment in October 
2010 through December 2010 in the 
prelaw cohort to allow for a 3-month 
implementation period.
study Population
The study population included 
children younger than 18 years old 
who visited an ED or were admitted

Downloaded from 
 to a hospital in Massachusetts with 
the International Classification of 
Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical 
Modification external cause of 
injury codes (e-codes) specific 
to ORV-related injuries. E-codes 
E821.0, “non-traffic accident 
involving other off-road motor 
vehicle (MV); driver of MV other 
than motorcycle, 
” and E821.1, “non-
traffic accident involving other 
off-road motor vehicle; passenger 
in MV other than motorcycle” were 
used. Data were provided by the 
Massachusetts Department of Public 
Health and derived from analysis of 
Massachusetts hospital discharge and 
ED discharge data from the Center for 
Health Information and Analysis.
Children were grouped into 4 age 
categories on the basis of changes 
specific to different age groups in the 
2010 law. Group 1 (age 0–9 years) 
represented children who had been 
restricted from operating an ORV 
throughout the entire study period, 
both pre- and postlaw. Group 2 (age 
10–13 years) represented children 
who, before 2010, could operate an 
ORV if supervised by a parent on 
private land but were banned from 
all ORVs postlaw unless participating 
in a sanctioned event. Group 3 (age 
14–17 years) included children who 
could operate an ORV throughout the 
study period but were restricted to 
smaller engine sizes (14- to 16-year-
olds) or required to take an ATV 
safety course (14- to 17-year-olds) 
postlaw. Group 4 (25- to 34-year-
olds) was used as the comparison 
cohort because this population would 
not have been directly affected by the 
ORV laws during the study period. 
This age group would also be old 
enough to not be experiencing any 
persistent effects of restrictions 
on younger persons. For inpatient 
hospital discharges, rates for children 
0 to 17 years old were used because 
of a lower number of subjects and 
privacy restrictions on data use. The 
US Census Bureau database provided 
age-based population census data 
needed to derive population-based 
rates of ED and hospital discharges.
Primary Outcomes
The pre- and postlaw periods were 
compared for all 4 age groups. The 
primary outcomes were the rates of 
ED visits per population and the rates 
of inpatient hospital discharges per 
population.
statistical analysis
The rates of ED visits per 100 000 
persons were derived and compared 
pre- and postlaw for all 4 age groups 
by using the total population of 
each age group (0–9, 10–13, 14–17, 
and 25–34 years old). The rates of 
inpatient hospital discharges per 
100 000 persons were also derived 
for 2 age groups (0–17 and 25–34 
years old) and compared pre- and 
postlaw. Poisson regression was 
used to compare the rates among age 
groups.
Segmented regression analysis 
was also used to evaluate the 
effectiveness of the law in children 
<14 years old. Segmented regression 
analysis can detect whether an 
intervention effect is significantly 
greater than the secular trend.23, 
 
24  
Yearly rates and percent change 
over time in the rate of the outcome 
during the prelaw period were 
compared with the percent change 
over time of the postlaw period. We 
used a Poisson regression model. 
The full segmented regression model 
included a prelaw intercept, a prelaw 
slope, a change in level after the 
law’s implementation, and a change 
in slope postlaw implementation. 
Backward stepwise regression 
methods were used to create a 
parsimonious segmented regression 
model by eliminating parameters 
with P > .05. A 2-sided P ≤ .05 was 
considered statistically significant. 
Statistical analyses were performed 
in SAS software (Version 9.4; SAS 
Institute Inc, Cary, NC).
Results
From 2002 to 2013, there were 
3638 ED visits and 481 inpatient 
hospitalizations for ORV-related 
injuries in Massachusetts residents 
younger than 18 years old (Table 1).
Postlaw eD Visits
After the implementation of an 
updated ORV law in 2010, there was 
a 33% decline in the rates of ED visits 
for children ages 0–9 years (P < .001), 
a 50% decline in the rates of ED visits 
for 10- to 13-year-olds (P < .001), and 
a 39% decline in rates of ED visits

 for 14- to 17-year-olds (P < .001) 
(Fig 1). There was no significant 
drop in the rates for 25- to 34-year-
olds, with the rate of ED visits per 
population remaining stable at ∼30.0 
per 100 000 persons. Rates were 
overall the highest in 14- to 17-year-
olds, with a prelaw rate of 52.0 per 
100 000 persons that declined to 31.8 
between 2011 and 2013.
Segmented regression analysis 
of population-based ED visits 
for 0- to 13-year-olds showed a 
significant 28.5% (95% confidence 
interval, 22.0%–34.6%) drop in the 
rate immediately after the law’s 
implementation from 11.5 visits per 
100 000 persons to 8.2 per 100 000 
persons (Fig 2). The slope of the pre- 
and postlaw regression lines did not 
statistically differ. The model for 25- 
to 34-year-olds showed no statistical 
change in levels or slopes over time.
Postlaw Inpatient hospitalizations
When comparing the pre- and 
postlaw periods, the rates for 0-  
to 17-year-olds declined by 41%  
(P < .001), whereas there was a 26% 
(P = .04) decline in the rates for 25- 
to 34-year-olds (Fig 1).
DIscussIOn
Since its implementation, the 2010 
Massachusetts ORV legislation has 
contributed to a sustained decrease 
in the rates of ED visits and inpatient 
hospitalizations in children younger 
than 18 years old. In comparison, 
adults ages 25 to 34 years showed 
no change in their rates of ED visits 
during the study period and a less 
impressive drop in hospitalizations. 
The greatest decline in injuries was 
a 50% decrease in 10- to 13-year-
olds, the cohort most affected by the 
age restriction of the new law (Table 
1). Our results also demonstrate a 
significant 28% drop in the rate of ED 
visits in all children <14 years old in 
our state immediately after the law’s 
implementation (Fig 2). Although 
there was a decline in injuries 
observed in the 14- to 17-year-old 
age group, this decrease was less 
robust, and these children continue 
to have the highest population-based 
injury rates in the state.
Before our findings, state-level ORV 
legislation had variable success in 
reducing pediatric injuries.5, 
 
14, 
 
16 
–18, 
 
25 
Most laws have focused on education, 
training, helmet requirements, and 
prohibiting the riding of ORVs on 
public roads and highways.14, 
 
16, 
 
25– 
27 
Few states have included meaningful 
age restrictions in their regulations. 
Because of this variability in ORV 
laws, the evaluation of their impact 
has been challenging. Furthermore, 
the lack of reliable data on ORV 
ridership, injury reporting, and 
enforcement have made it difficult to 
effectively comment on the outcomes 
of these laws. There is ongoing 
discussion about what restrictions to 
include in state laws to best protect 
young riders.6, 
 
18, 
 
26
Debate on the impact of education 
and training on injury and fatality 
rates is longstanding. Most ATV 
riders report having had minimal 
formal instruction in safe-riding 
practices.12, 
 
28, 
 
29 Previous studies 
have shown that safety education 
efforts are successful in increasing 
knowledge but are less effective 
at impacting riding behavior.29– 
31 
Helmkamp et al18 compared state-
specific ATV fatality rates from 
2000 to 2007 with 1990 to 1999 
and found that statewide training 
requirements were not associated 
with decreased rates of ATV-related 
death rates. Therefore, the literature 
has suggested that an optimal state 
law needs to go beyond mandatory 
training requirements to be 
successful at combating pediatric 
ORV injuries and fatalities.
Of all the attempts to affect outcomes, 
helmet use has consistently been 
shown to have a significant effect on 
decreasing both the morbidity and 
mortality of ATV riders.12, 
 
25, 
 
32 
–34  
Helmets have been shown to 
decrease head injuries by as much 
as 58% in ATV crashes as well as 
prevent facial and neck trauma.4, 
 
18, 
 
25  
States with mandatory helmet-use 
requirements for ORV riders have

 also shown reduced rates of ORV-
related deaths.18 Although lifesaving, 
routine helmet use by children occurs 
<50% of the time, recent literature 
suggests.35 Additionally, although 
helmets are successful in the 
prevention of trauma to the head and 
neck, crush injuries from rollovers 
onto smaller children have not been 
impacted by helmet laws.36, 
 
37
Age restrictions were missing  
from state ORV laws before the  
early 1990s. Since then, study 
conclusions have been mixed on 
whether they have had an impact  
on pediatric injury and fatality  
rates.7, 
 
14, 
 
16 Analyses of North 
Carolina and Pennsylvania 
laws demonstrated little to no 
impact on the number of injuries 
postimplementation, although both 
states had age restrictions that were 
much younger than 14 years old.7, 
14, 
 
16  
These studies also showed little 
change at a time when ATV injuries 
were markedly climbing in other 
states, suggesting some effect of 
legislation.7 Our results are the first 
to show substantial reductions in 
pediatric injuries after the passage 
of a state law with an age restriction 
that included all children up to age 
14 years on both public and private 
land.38
The previous Massachusetts law 
(passed in 1998) allowed children 
as young as 10 years old to operate 
ORVs on private land with adult 
supervision. Given the increased 
injuries in this age group, as well 
as data showing more than half 
of pediatric injuries had occurred 
on private land, advocacy efforts 
in our state were successful in 
further regulating this vulnerable 
population.6, 
 
39, 
 
40 Figure 2 shows 
that the decline in injuries observed 
before 2010 was followed by an 
abrupt 28% drop in the population-
based rate after the absolute 
age restriction (<14 years old). 
Specifically, we saw a 50% reduction 
in injuries in the 10- to 13-year-old 
age group, suggesting that these 
strict guidelines contributed to the 
effects seen. These results support 
the recommendations of professional 
societies that more stringent ORV

 age restrictions may contribute to 
decreased morbidity.
Another important provision of the 
law that may have contributed to the 
favorable outcomes is the limitation 
of the size of a vehicle’s engine to  
90 cm3 for young riders. Not only does 
the engine size limitation decrease 
the maximum speed of the vehicle 
but it also substantially decreases 
the weight. This is significant in that 
orthopedic and crush injuries from 
rollovers on to smaller children are 
thought to contribute significantly 
to morbidity.35, 
 
36, 
 
41 Vehicles with 
larger engines that are designed for 
adults have been consistently shown 
to increase the risk for fatalities and 
injuries in children.42, 
43 After the 
implementation of the engine size 
restriction in Massachusetts, the rate 
of ED visits fell by 39% from 52 to 
32 per 100 000 persons in the 14- to 
17-year-old age group. At the same 
time, an additional provision (the 
mandatory training for youth) was 
broadened to include their parents. 
We postulate that the documented 
decrease in the injury rate is a 
combination of the strict, graded age 
restrictions of 14- to 16-year-olds, 
as well as an increased awareness 
of safe riding behaviors that are 
emphasized in the required training 
programs.
Our study has several limitations. 
First, it was conducted in a single 
state with lower exposure to ORVs 
than many other states.44 A lack of 
accurate ORV-exposure data also 
makes rates difficult to determine. 
E-codes used in our analysis did 
not specify specific ORV subtypes. 
However, the Massachusetts law 
explicitly references all ORVs, 
including SxSs and ATVs. The few 
other ORV vehicle types that might be 
included in the e-codes would likely 
have also shown similar decreases 
both pre- and postlaw and would 
be unlikely to adversely affect the 
analysis of the legislation’s effects. 
Recently, we successfully advocated 
for new e-codes to better separate 
injuries related to 3- or 4-wheel ORVs 
from those related to motocross or 
dirt bikes; these will be available 
for use in fall 2017. Population-
based data sets may also lose track 
of patients transported across 
state lines for care. Finally, it was 
difficult to study any of the individual 
components of the law in isolation 
or to control for enforcement of the 
law across the state, particularly on 
private land, to determine if any 1 of 
these variables had a greater effect 
than another.
cOnclusIOns
ORV-related injuries continue to 
be a major public health problem, 
especially for those younger than 
18 years old. Our study adds to the 
evidence in favor of legislation as an 
effective means of reducing pediatric 
ORV injuries and fatalities. Strong 
regulations should contain all the 
components outlined by the AAP 
model bill, including a minimum age 
requirement of 16 years. Our state’s 
success, albeit with challenges, 
has shown promise in combating 
pediatric ORV-related injuries 
and could serve as an example in 
other states’ efforts to strengthen 
their laws. Although our results 
are promising, it is our intention to 
continue to examine our state law’s 
impact and sustainability as time 
goes on. Future efforts will focus 
on increasing the minimum age 
requirements to 16 years as  
well as finding additional means 
to both analyze and strengthen 
enforcement.

We thank the Massachusetts 
Department of Public Health for its 
help in data acquisition, especially 
Beth Hume for her help in data 
collection and retrieval. Thank 
you also to former Massachusetts 
State Senator and Chair of the Joint 
Committee on Transportation Steven 
Baddour for writing the ORV bill 
and advocating for the enactment 
of this legislation. We also thank 
former State Senate President 
Therese Murray, Speaker of the 
Massachusetts House Robert DeLeo, 
State Senator Viriato deMacedo, 
and Sheriff Peter Koutoujian for 
their efforts in getting Sean’s Law 
passed. Finally, we acknowledge 
the Kearney family, whose selfless 
work after their personal loss helped 
prevent life-altering injuries to many 
children.
