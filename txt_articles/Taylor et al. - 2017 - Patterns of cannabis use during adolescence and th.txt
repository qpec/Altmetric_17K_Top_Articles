ABSTRACT
Background Evidence on the role of cannabis as a
gateway drug is inconsistent. We characterise patterns of
cannabis use among UK teenagers aged 13–18 years,
and assess their influence on problematic substance use
at age 21 years.
Methods We used longitudinal latent class analysis to
derive trajectories of cannabis use from self-report
measures in a UK birth cohort. We investigated (1)
factors associated with latent class membership and (2)
whether latent class membership predicted subsequent
nicotine dependence, harmful alcohol use and recent use
of other illicit drugs at age 21 years.
Results 5315 adolescents had three or more measures
of cannabis use from age 13 to 18 years. Cannabis use
patterns were captured as four latent classes
corresponding to ‘non-users’ (80.1%), ‘late-onset
occasional’ (14.2%), ‘early-onset occasional’ (2.3%) and
‘regular’ users (3.4%). Sex, mother’s substance use, and
child’s tobacco use, alcohol consumption and conduct
problems were strongly associated with cannabis use. At
age 21 years, compared with the non-user class, late-
onset occasional, early-onset occasional and regular
cannabis user classes had higher odds of nicotine
dependence (OR=3.5, 95% CI 0.7 to 17.9; OR=12.1,
95% CI 1.0 to 150.3; and OR=37.2, 95% CI 9.5 to
144.8, respectively); harmful alcohol consumption
(OR=2.6, 95% CI 1.5 to 4.3; OR=5.0, 95% CI 2.1 to
12.1; and OR=2.6, 95% CI 1.0 to 7.1, respectively);
and other illicit drug use (OR=22.7, 95% CI 11.3 to
45.7; OR=15.9, 95% CI 3.9 to 64.4; and OR=47.9,
95% CI 47.9 to 337.0, respectively).
Conclusions One-fifth of the adolescents in our
sample followed a pattern of occasional or regular
cannabis use, and these young people were more likely
to progress to harmful substance use behaviours in early
adulthood.
INTRODUCTION
Cannabis use is the commonest form of illicit sub-
stance use in the UK and many other countries1 2
and is central to public and policy debate on risks
and benefits of drug control, classification and
harms.3
The
potential
harms
of
cannabis
use
during adolescence include altered brain develop-
ment, cognitive impairment, chronic bronchitis and
adverse mental health outcomes.4 Evidence on the
role of adolescent cannabis use as a gateway to use
of other illicit drugs, and its relationship with
tobacco use and alcohol, is inconsistent.5–12
Longitudinal studies are required to tease out the
relationship between cannabis use exposure and
drug-related harm.7 13 As young people do not ini-
tiate cannabis use at the same time, or develop
similar patterns during adolescence, latent variable
modelling is a useful tool to characterise different
adolescent cannabis trajectories.14
15 Further, to
test the relationship between adolescent exposure
and outcomes in adulthood, it is important that the
trajectories are developed independently of the
outcome.16 17 Studies have developed joint trajec-
tories of cannabis and other substances18 19 but
few have developed trajectories based on cannabis
use alone. Those that have developed trajectories
solely based on cannabis use tend to continue them
well into adulthood and focus on a single outcome,
rather than defining trajectories during adolescence
in relation to multiple outcomes during early
adulthood.16 17 20
In this paper, we aim to use data from the Avon
Longitudinal
Study
of
Parents
and
Children
(ALSPAC) to (1) describe patterns of cannabis use
during adolescence (rather than patterns of mul-
tiple substances) using longitudinal latent class ana-
lysis; (2) to determine factors associated with these
patterns (including indicators of socioeconomic
status); and (3) to investigate whether cannabis use
predicts the use of tobacco, alcohol and other illicit
drug use in early adulthood (age 21 years).
METHODS
Study population
ALSPAC is a UK population-based birth cohort.21
Pregnant women residing in the former Avon
Health Authority in south-west England who had
an estimated date of delivery between 1 April 1991
and 31 December 1992 were invited to take part,
resulting in a cohort of 14 541 pregnancies and
13 978 children alive at 12 months of age. Ethical
approval for this study was obtained from the
ALSPAC Law and Ethics Committee and the Local
Research Ethics Committees. The ALSPAC study
website contains details of all the data that are
available through a fully searchable data dictionary
(http://www.bris.ac.uk/alspac/researchers/data-access/
data-dictionary/).
Measures
Cannabis use
Information on cannabis use was collected on six
occasions throughout adolescence via questionnaire
(Q) or during a clinic (C). Median ages at response
were: 13 years 10 months (C), 14 years 2 months
(Q), 15 years 5 months (C), 16 years 7 months (Q),
17 years 9 months (C) and 18 years 8 months (Q).

 For simplicity, we will refer to these ages as 13, 14, 15, 16, 17
and 18 years. Responses to one or more questions at each time
point were used to derive a repeated three-level ordinal variable
with categories ‘Do not use’, ‘Occasional’ (typically less than
once per week) and ‘Frequent’ (typically once a week or more)
(full details in online supplementary table S1).
Predictors
A range of predictors were considered as potential risk factors
for trajectories of cannabis use. These measures have previously
been shown to be associated with profiles of tobacco use22 and
more
modestly
associated
with
profiles
of
alcohol
use.23
Measures included (1) demographic variables collected prebirth
around the time of enrolment, comprising housing tenure,
crowding status, maternal education and parity; (2) maternal
substance use in the offspring’s later childhood collected via
questionnaire, which comprised maternal smoking and alcohol
consumption when the offspring were 12 years old, and mater-
nal cannabis use when the offspring were aged 9 years, and (3)
young person’s factors collected through focus clinic at age
12 years 10 months and postal questionnaire at 11 years, which
comprised tobacco/alcohol use at 12 years 10 months, and
conduct
problems
at
11 years

mother-reported
Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire.24
Problematic substance use behaviours at age 21 years
Data for outcome
measures
at
age
21
(median
20 years
11 months) years were obtained via postal questionnaire. W
e
used a cut-off of 16 points and above on the alcohol use disor-
ders identification test13 25 to indicate ‘harmful’ alcohol use,
and compared this with ‘low-risk’ or ‘hazardous’ as a combined
reference group. W
e used the Fagerström test for nicotine
dependence,26
comparing
medium/high/very
high
nicotine
dependence with non-smoker/very low/low dependence.
W
e derived an indicator for those reporting the use of any of
the following other illicit drugs (except cannabis) in the previous
3 months. Of those reporting recent use (N=462), 176 (38%)
had used cocaine, 278 (60%) had used amphetamine, 136
(30%) had used inhalants, 72 (16%) had used sedatives, 105
(23%) had used hallucinogens and 25 (6%) had used opioids.
W
e did not use a measure of other illicit drug abuse or depend-
ence due to the low prevalence in our sample. As initiation of
substance use is implicated as triggering the cascade in the
gateway hypothesis,5 any use of other illicit drugs could be
regarded as problematic or worthy of concern.
Statistical methods
Longitudinal latent class analysis was used to derive trajectories
of cannabis use. To establish the optimal number of latent
classes, we used: (1) the sample size-adjusted Bayesian informa-
tion criterion; (2) the bootstrap likelihood ratio test;27 (3)
entropy and (d) bivariate model fit information. W
e repeated
the estimation procedure while varying the amount of missing
data. Analyses were carried out using Mplus V
.7.11.28 More
information is provided in online supplementary table S2.
Risk factors for class membership were estimated using multi-
nomial logistic regression models using the normative latent
class as the baseline category for the outcome before reparame-
terising to derive comparisons across the other outcome classes.
Parameter estimates were obtained using the ‘Modal ML’ three-
step method.29 30 This has been shown to produce less biased
estimates than traditional three-step ‘classify–analyse’ methods
while avoiding the problem of covariates impacting on the
measurement model itself.29
The association between latent class membership and subse-
quent harmful behaviours at age 21 years was estimated using
logistic regression models with class membership as a nominal
predictor (also employing the modal ML technique). Estimates
were adjusted for the potential confounding effects of: sex;
sociodemographic indicators, maternal substance use; child’s
conduct problems in late childhood; and finally alcohol and
tobacco use at age 12 years, 10 months. There were insufficient
cases of other illicit drug use at this earlier age, so these data
were not used.
RESULTS
Of 13 978 children in ALSPAC, the sample with available data
ranged from 4664 at age 13 to 2939 at age 18 years. A total of
5315 (38.0%) adolescents had cannabis use assessed at three or
more time points, of whom 2921 (55.0%) had complete data for
all covariates and 1571 (29.6%) had data for all covariates and
substance use outcomes at age 21 years. Differences between par-
ticipants with and without complete data were consistent with
those shown previously,31 with higher losses to follow-up among
families from lower social classes (data not shown).
Patterns of cannabis use
The prevalence of both occasional and regular cannabis use
increased between the ages of 13 and 18 years (table 1). There
was good agreement that a four-class solution was adequate in
explaining the heterogeneity in the cannabis use data. Much of
the gains made by using the sample with one or more measures
were lost following the inclusion of the early risk factors. As
such, we focus on the sample for which 3+ cannabis use mea-
surements were available (model fit statistics and a discussion of
our decision process can be found in online supplementary
table S2). This four-class solution comprised patterns of canna-
bis use that we labelled as ‘non-user’ (80.1%), ‘late-onset occa-
sional’ (14.2%), ‘early-onset occasional’ (2.3%) and ‘regular
user’ (3.4%) (figure 1).
Risk factors associated with patterns of cannabis use
Household income and factors indicative of lower socio-
economic status were neither strong nor consistently associated
with cannabis use. Living in rented or subsidised housing, mater-
nal tobacco smoking when the child was 12 years old and

 childhood (12 years and 10 months) substance use and conduct
problems were associated with regular cannabis use. Childhood
tobacco and alcohol use prior to cannabis trajectories showed the
greatest association with early-onset occasional cannabis use.
Being female was inversely associated with regular cannabis use.
Having an older sibling was associated with higher odds of
early-onset occasional cannabis use. Lower levels of maternal edu-
cation were associated with lower odds of late-onset and-early
onset occasional cannabis use. Mother’s use of cannabis when
the child was 9 years old was associated with late-onset occa-
sional, early-onset occasional and regular cannabis use (table 2).
Associations of cannabis use with harmful behaviours at
age 21 years
Cannabis use during adolescence was associated with increased
odds of harmful substance use behaviours at age 21 years, com-
pared with non-users (table 3). There was evidence for an asso-
ciation between cannabis use and nicotine dependence, with
stronger associations being observed with increasing cannabis
use latent classes (ie, consistent with a dose–response relation-
ship). Regular cannabis use showed the strongest association
with other illicit drug use. Early-onset cannabis use (in compari-
son to no cannabis use) showed the strongest association with
harmful alcohol consumption, with late-onset cannabis use and
regular cannabis use also being associated. When assessing can-
nabis as a risk factor for nicotine dependence and illicit drug
use, an increase in risk between cannabis classes was also
observed when comparing regular use to early-onset and
late-onset cannabis use, respectively.
Adjustment for potential confounders showed evidence of
negative and positive confounding. Sociodemographic measures
negatively confounded the crude associations of cannabis use with
nicotine dependence, slightly positively confounded the crude
associations of cannabis use with harmful alcohol consumption
and had little or no confounding effect on crude associations of
cannabis use with other illicit drug use. Unadjusted estimates from
the complete case sample for each adjusted model showed that
substantial changes to the adjusted estimates were the result of
adjustment for confounders and not selection bias in the
decreased sample (see online supplementary table S3). Further
investigation showed inconsistent social patterning across the
three outcomes considered (see online supplementary table S4),
with low maternal education and low household income being
positively associated with nicotine dependence yet inversely
associated with alcohol and other illicit drug use.
DISCUSSION
W
e characterised four adolescent cannabis use trajectories—with
∼80% classified as non-users, 17% as infrequent users (late or
early-onset) and over 3% as regular users. Males were more
likely to belong to the regular user class. W
e found a strong
positive association between the cannabis use trajectories and
harmful substance use in adulthood. In adjusted models, regular
adolescent cannabis users had 37-fold, 3-fold and 26-fold
higher odds of tobacco dependence, harmful alcohol use and
other illicit drug use, respectively, in adulthood compared with
non-users. Early-onset and late-onset occasional adolescent can-
nabis classes also were associated with these outcomes, with evi-
dence for a dose–response effect observed between cannabis use
and tobacco dependence. Cannabis use trajectories were asso-
ciated with maternal substance use, child conduct problems and
early tobacco or alcohol use. W
e observed a moderate to strong
effect of social patterning on the cannabis use trajectories.

 Strengths and limitations
ALSPAC is a well-characterised birth cohort with repeated mea-
sures of cannabis use—which has been used in several other
studies of adolescent substance use.22 23 The number of people
analysed in our study is larger than many other studies including
a recent synthesis of three cohorts,32 and our estimates are con-
sistent with household and school surveys.33 However, there are
limitations to our study.
First, there are considerable losses to follow-up—with high
rates of attrition among less affluent families and participants
who may be more likely to use cannabis and adopt harmful
behaviours in early adulthood. W
e have previously observed dif-
ferences in the prevalence of atypical trajectories of smoking
behaviour, with twice the rate of persistent daily users derived
following the inclusion of partial responders,22 but not in alcohol
trajectories.23 On this occasion, we observe more moderate

 changes in the class distribution when altering the analytical
sample, which is likely to be a reflection of the fact that in our
UK birth cohort, cannabis use is less socially patterned than
tobacco use. Although the proportions of regular and early-onset
users decreased slightly as the number of time points increased
(regular users from 3% with 3+ time points to 2% with all 6
time points, early-onset occasional users from 2% to 1%), the
overall distribution (∼80% non-users, ∼15% late-onset occasional
users, ∼5% regular or early-onset users) remained stable (see
online supplementary table S2). With regard to missing covariate
information, listwise deletion remains the status quo34 with meth-
odological obstacles to the application of alternatives. There is
currently a lack of research on the use of other methods, such as
multiple imputation, for latent class analysis.35
36 Standard
imputation methods are ineffective when group membership is
inferred from the data (ie, is latent) as group differences in the
mean and covariance structure across the hidden latent classes
will not be preserved. This has previously been demonstrated and
discussed in detail.36 In brief, when using multiple imputation in
this framework, we would effectively be conducting an imput-
ation under a multigroups SEM model, where the grouping is
unknown. In addition, the effect sizes for tobacco dependence
and other illicit drug use are unlikely to be reversed or negated
by any analysis on imputed data.
Second, the potential contribution made by concurrent use of
other substances and other conditions that often co-occur with
cannabis warrants careful consideration. W
e have shown strong
associations between patterns of adolescent cannabis use and
problematic use of other substances in early adulthood. When
studying cannabis and risk of, for example, harmful alcohol use,
it is possible that some of the observed association between can-
nabis use and alcohol use is due to the emergence of alcohol use
concurrent to the use of cannabis. Previous literature has
reported that studies of longitudinal psychosocial outcomes37
should strive to better address the potential problem of con-
founding. While we are not addressing psychosocial outcomes
here, we acknowledge that this is a transferable issue. Owing to
our chosen longitudinal mixture model, we have opted to adjust
for early use of alcohol and tobacco, that is, measured before
cannabis use was first considered. W
e have previously shown
these measures to be strongly predictive of subsequent use,22 23
and we also observe early alcohol/tobacco use to confer a con-
siderable risk of our 21-year problem outcomes (see online
supplementary table S5).
Finally, our data on exposure and outcome are based on self-
report and so maybe subject to misclassification. However, for
population surveys there are no reliable biological alternatives
for cannabis or alcohol.38 39
Findings in context with other studies and implications
W
e find different effects of social patterning on substance use
trajectories. Maternal education was observed to have a negative
impact on cannabis in contrast to a moderate effect of social
patterning on alcohol trajectories and strong effect on tobacco

Rates of harmful behaviours across class were as follows: non-cannabis users (1% nicotine dependence, 8.4% harmful alcohol consumption, 13.6% other illicit drug use); late-onset
occasional cannabis users (4.3% nicotine dependence, 28.0% harmful alcohol consumption, 83.1% other illicit drug use); early-onset occasional cannabis users (5.5% nicotine
dependence, 42.7% harmful alcohol consumption, 83.0% other illicit drug use); regular cannabis users (21.2% nicotine dependence, 23.9% harmful alcohol consumption, 94.3% other
illicit drug use).
Reference categories for outcomes are: nicotine dependence ‘non-smoker/low/very low dependence’; alcohol consumption ‘low risk/hazardous’; other illicit drug use ‘never used/not used
in last 3 months’.
Confounders adjusted for: (model 1) sex; household income, housing tenure; crowding status; birth order; maternal educational attainment; (model 2) additionally adjusted for maternal
substance use (smoking, alcohol consumption and cannabis use); (model 3) additionally adjusted for child conduct problems at age 11 years; (model 4) additionally adjusted for tobacco
and alcohol use at age 13 years.
All p values <0.001.

 trajectories.22 23 This provides evidence that our findings cannot
be solely due to residual confounding due to poorly measured
social factors, since these social factors are differently associated
with each 21-year outcome.
Other studies of latent class trajectories of cannabis use in
adolescence have reported similar numbers of group trajectories
with similar definitions and sizes.14 17 20 As with other studies,
our trajectories did discriminate clearly between participants,
and could be used as ‘categorical’ variables rather than distribu-
tions.16–18 Few longitudinal studies have solely examined canna-
bis use across adolescence and its relationship with other drug
behaviours in early adulthood. Other studies have sought to
describe trajectories using a composite measure of two or more
drugs—or extended the trajectories into later ages when the
outcome occurs and so are not directly comparable with our
study. As we have shown differences in social patterning for dif-
ferent licit and illicit substances, a single composite measure of
drug use does not seem appropriate for this population.
Previous studies have used a wide range of techniques to
provide evidence for or against the gateway hypothesis includ-
ing standard epidemiological techniques,11
12 co-twin ana-
lysis,8 longitudinal modelling,7 genetic studies9 and mixed
models.10 Our finding that regular cannabis users have greater
odds of later nicotine dependence, harmful alcohol use and
other illicit drug use is consistent with many other studies that
have sought to examine the gateway hypothesis.6 8–10 Here, we
have
observed
stronger
associations
than
those
generally
reported, which may be in part because our outcomes are
more refined (at age 21) than other studies that have examined
cannabis use at a single time point or measure the outcome
many years after the trajectories.20 Several other studies report
either associations between cannabis exposure or dependence
and other illicit drug use,17
18 or alcohol consumption20
whereas we assess associations between licit and illicit beha-
viours, including nicotine dependence which, to the best of
our knowledge, has not previously been assessed. However,
our results are inconsistent with some studies that have
reported no association between cannabis use and alcohol use7
or between cannabis use and tobacco use.11
Interpretation of the underlying mechanism of the associ-
ation, however, cannot be tested by our analyses. Our data are
consistent with adolescent cannabis use as a ‘gateway’ to adult
substance dependence and illicit drug use which could relate
either to a biological, behavioural or environmental mechan-
ism; and our data are consistent with theories of shared
genetic vulnerabilities to substance use.40 Equally, we cannot
entirely rule out confounding as an alternative explanation.
Cannabis and tobacco are highly correlated and it is difficult to
distinguish their separate effects. Furthermore, the gateway
hypothesis suggests a sequence to the use of various drugs, as
such there is no single ‘gateway’ drug and one might expect
tobacco and alcohol to predict later cannabis use and other
illicit drug use.22 23
Conclusion
Adolescent substance use also clusters with other risk behaviours
which are strongly associated with outcomes in adulthood. Our
study does not support or refute arguments for altering the
legal status of cannabis use—especially since two of the out-
comes are legal in the UK. This study and others do, however,
lend support to public health strategies and interventions that
aim to reduce cannabis exposure in young people.
What is already known on this subject?
▸ Different forms of substance use in adolescents and young
people cluster.
▸ However, support for the ‘gateway hypothesis’ suggesting
that cannabis leads to the use of other substances is
inconsistent.
▸ In part, this is because of a lack of longitudinal studies and
refined measures of cannabis exposure during adolescence.
What this study adds?
▸ Robust cannabis use trajectories were defined and
categorised as ‘non-users’ (80.1%), ‘late-onset occasional’
(14.2%), ‘early-onset occasional’ (2.3%) and ‘regular’ users
(3.4%).
▸ There was a dose–response relationship between cannabis
use trajectories in adolescence and nicotine dependence,
harmful alcohol consumption and other illicit drug use by
age 21.
