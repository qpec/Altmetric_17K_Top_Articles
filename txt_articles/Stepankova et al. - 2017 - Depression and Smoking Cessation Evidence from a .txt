Abstract
Background Smoking is more prevalent among people with
depression. Depression may make cessation more difficult
and cessation may affect depression symptoms.
Purpose The aims of this study were to assess the associa-
tions between (1) baseline depression and 1-year smoking
abstinence and (2) abstinence and change in depression.
Methods Observational study using data collected routinely
in a smoking cessation clinic in the Czech Republic from 2008
to 2014. Aim 1: N = 3775 patients; 14.3% reported mild and
15.4% moderate/severe baseline depression levels measured
using Beck’s Depression Inventory (BDI-II). Logistic regres-
sions assessed if depression level predicted 1-year biochemi-
cally verified abstinence while adjusting for patient and
treatment characteristics. Aim 2: N = 835 patients abstinent
at 1 year; change in depression was analysed using Chi-square
statistics, t test and mixed method analyses of variance.
Results Rate of abstinence was lower for patients with mild
(32.5%, OR = 0.68; 95% CI: 0.54 to 0.87, p = 0.002) and
moderate/severe depression (25.8%; OR = 0.57, 95% CI:
0.45 to 0.74, p < 0.001) compared with patients without de-
pression (40.5%).
Across abstinent patients, the majority with baseline de-
pression reported lower depression levels at follow-up.
Overall mean (SD) BDI-II scores improved from 9.2 (8.6) to
5.3 (6.1); t(834) = 14.6, p < 0.001. There were significant
main effects of time (F(1832) = 880.8, p < 0.001, partial
η2 = 0.51) and baseline depression level (F(2832) = 666.4,
p < 0.001, partial η2 = 0.62) on follow-up depression and a
significant depression * time interaction (F(2832) = 296.5,
p < 0.001, partial η2 = 0.42).
Conclusions In this effective smoking cessation clinic, de-
pression at the start of treatment predicted reduced smoking
abstinence 1 year later. Patients abstinent from smoking expe-
rienced considerable improvement in depression.

Introduction
A substantial proportion of all smokers have a history of de-
pression, and among people with depression, smoking preva-
lence is about twice as high as in the general population [1–3],
leading to increased morbidity and premature mortality [4–6].
There are also associations between depression and smoking
cessation. Earlier research raised concerns that smoking

 cessation may lead to an increase in symptoms, recurrence or
even emergence of depression (e.g. [7]), which is one reason
why clinicians may be reluctant to address smoking in patients
with mental health problems [8]. In contrast to these concerns, a
recent systematic review and meta-analysis of longitudinal stud-
ies found that compared with continuing to smoke, quitting
smoking was associated with a significant decrease in depres-
sion from baseline to follow-up [9]. This is corroborated by
recent findings from smoking cessation practice indicating con-
tinuous improvements in depression symptoms over 1 year
among those who quit smoking and no change in those who
continued to smoke [10]. However, in a longitudinal study in
older smokers, quitting smoking had no impact on depression
[11]. Others have found changes in depression to vary depend-
ing on the stop smoking medication used [12].
Just as cessation may have effects on depression, depression
alsoappearstoaffectcessation.Pastdepressionhasbeenfoundto
predict reduced success when attempting to quit smoking. A re-
cent review and meta-analysis found that past major depression
was associated with a statistically significant, but modest, de-
crease in both short- and long-term abstinence rates [13].
Having experienced depression and pre-cessation depressed
mood have also been found to be associated with increased re-
lapse[14,15].Inoldersmokers(notallofwhomwereattempting
to quit), level of depression predicted continued smoking [11],
and there is evidence across all ages that the negative effect of
depression on cessation is stronger for women [16, 17].
Despite these findings, research on treating tobacco depen-
dence and depression has been described as being in its infancy
[18].Onelimitationoftheextantresearchondepressionaspredic-
torofcessationsuccessisthat studiesgenerallylookedatsmokers

more research into the association between current symptoms or

studies explicitly exclude smokers using antidepressants; thus, it

The aims of the present analysis were to use data from
clinical practice to assess (1) the association between baseline
level of depression and 1-year smoking abstinence and (2)
change in depression from baseline to 1-year follow-up in
those who achieved abstinence.
Methods
Intervention
The present data were routinely collected as part of smoking
cessation treatment at the Center for Tobacco Dependence at
the General University Hospital in Prague, Czech Republic.
Patients could be referred by their physician or self-refer to the
treatment centre. Treatment followed evidence-based
guidelines [21, 22] and was tailored to the individual patient’s
needs. Treatment consisted of face-to-face counselling and a
choice of pharmacotherapy for all patients and was provided
by a nurse and a physician; all physicians had completed
training courses developed by the Czech Medical chamber
or the Tobacco Treatment Specialist Certification Program at
the Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.
All patients were treated as outpatients, and over the course
of a year, each patient visited the clinic several times. The first
visit took about 1 h and was used to complete a basic physical
examination and to collect data on demographics, smoking
characteristics and dependence, quit attempt history and med-
ical history including self-reported mental health problems
and completion of the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II)
[23]. Patients also provided informed consent for their data
to be used in research. The second visit took up to 2 h; it
included discussion of physical and psychosocial dependence
on smoking and nicotine, strategies to reduce exposure to
smoking cues and to cope with cravings. Pharmacotherapy
options for smoking cessation were discussed and selected
cooperatively and a target date to quit smoking was set.
Follow-up visits took about 30 min each. The first one was
arranged to occur 1 week after the quit date, followed by
fortnightly visits during the first 3 months and monthly visits
during months 3 to 6. The final follow-up took place 1 year
after the actual quit date; the basic physical examination and
BDI-II were repeated and total duration of pharmacotherapy
for cessation recorded. At all visits, carbon monoxide (CO)
was measured, and information on smoking cessation phar-
macotherapy and any changes in medical history were
recorded.
The treatment did not include any specific treatment for
depression or other mental health problems. The
counselling/behavioural support was covered by health insur-
ance, but the cost of pharmacotherapy had to be covered by
the patient. A full description of the intervention is available at
www.slzt.cz/intervention-structure. Previous analysis showed
that at 1-year follow-up, 38% of patients were biochemically
verified abstinent from smoking [24]. These are very high
success rates compared for example with around 8% achieved
in UK stop smoking services [25] (which also deliver a com-
bination of behavioural support and pharmacotherapy, albeit
usually restricted to a shorter period of time ) and compared
with the Mayo clinic which uses a similar treatment model and
reported 28% self-reported abstinence at 6 months [26].
Measures
Patient Characteristics
Demographics recorded during the first (pre-treatment)
visit include age, gender, education (primary, secondary,
higher education) and marital status (married, divorced,

 widowed, single; collapsed into married versus not mar-
ried for analyses). Medical history included cigarette de-
pendence measured using the Fagerström Test of
Cigarette/Nicotine Dependence (FTCD/FTND) [27, 28];
for analysis, patients were split according to their scores
into ‘low’ (0 to 4) and ‘high’ (5, 10, to) dependence.
Depression symptoms were assessed using Beck’s
Depression Inventory (BDI-II, [23, 29]); for some analy-
ses, patients were categorised into ‘none or minimal’
(scores ≤13), ‘mild’ (14, 19, to) and ‘moderate/severe’
(≥20) depression; moderate and severe were collapsed to
avoid small group sizes. Patients also reported if they
were currently taking any antidepressant. Other mental
health problems (current and history of) were self-
reported by the patients and recorded as anxiety, schizo-
phrenia and bipolar disorder. Because frequency of self-
reported mental health problems was low, these were
combined into a measure of any other mental health prob-
lem (yes, no) for analysis.
Intervention Characteristics
Intervention characteristics included in the analysis were num-
ber of visits during the year and type and length of pharma-
cotherapy. A range of pharmacotherapy options and combina-
tions are possible; for analysis, these were coded as follows:
none, nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) only (mostly a
combination of two or more NRT products), varenicline only,
bupropion only or bupropion plus NRT, varenicline plus NRT,
other combinations and/or use of electronic cigarettes. Use of
a non-nicotinised inhaler (‘paipo’) was recorded, but not treat-
ed as pharmacotherapy and not taken into account for
categorisation. A combination of pharmacotherapy means that
a patient has used more than one type during their quit at-
tempt; this was not always concurrently and includes those
who used different options sequentially. Length of pharmaco-
therapy was recorded as number of months for which phar-
macotherapy was used.
Outcomes
Smoking abstinence at 1-year follow-up was defined as bio-
chemically verified self-reported abstinence. Patients who re-
ported not having smoked more than 5 cigarettes since quit
date who recorded concentrations below 10 ppm of carbon
monoxide in exhaled air were recorded as abstinent as defined
by the Russell Standard [30]. Patients lost to follow-up despite
multiple attempts at contact (15%) were recorded as not
abstinent [30].
Depression was again assessed at follow-up using the BDI-
II. Scores were used as continuous scale or categorised
(none/minimal, mild, moderate/severe) as at baseline.
Sample
Between January 2008 and December 2014, 4415 smokers
began treatment at the Centre for Tobacco Dependence.
Patients without information on baseline depression were ex-
cluded from all analyses (n = 998). Patients younger than 16
(n = 16) or older than 80 years (n = 5) were also excluded.
To address aim 1 (association between baseline level of
depression and outcome), patients missing information on
age or dependence (n = 16) were excluded, leaving n = 3380
patients for analyses. An additional analysis included length
of pharmacotherapy so that only patients taking any pharma-
cotherapy could be included (n = 2545).
To address aim 2 (change in depression), only patients with
information on depression level at baseline and 1-year follow-
up were included (n = 864). Among patients who were not
abstinent at 1 year, depression at follow-up was generally not
recorded; so, analysis had to be restricted to abstinent patients
(n = 835).
Analysis
Baseline characteristics of the sample, treatment characteris-
tics and 1-year outcomes were described. The association be-
tween baseline level of depression and outcome was assessed
in logistic regressions of 1-year abstinence onto baseline level
of depression (none, mild, moderate/severe); a first bivariate
model was followed by the primary model, a multiple logistic
regression that included baseline patient characteristics (age,
gender, education, marital status, cigarette dependence and
other mental health problems) and treatment characteristics
(number of visits, type of pharmacotherapy). A further model
added an interaction for level of depression and gender.
Separate models replaced depression level with antidepressant
use at baseline. Finally, a separate analysis added length of
pharmacotherapy to the primary model; this was repeated with
an interaction term for length of pharmacotherapy and type of
pharmacotherapy.
Change in depression in abstinent patients was analysed
using both the categorisation into levels and the continuous
BDI-II score. The proportions of patients moving from one
category to another were described and significance of differ-
ence in proportions from baseline to 1-year follow-up tested
with Chi-square statistics. Mean BDI-II scores at baseline and
follow-up were compared using a paired t test. A mixed model
ANOVA assessed main effects of depression level and time as
well as the interaction of depression level and time on follow-
up BDI-II scores. Wilcoxon signed rank tests and sign tests
were used to confirm parametric results of differences in BDI-
II scores across time for the overall sample and by baseline
level of depression. A further mixed model ANOVA assessed
main effects of time and pharmacotherapy and the interaction

 of the two on mean BDI-II scores. All analyses were conduct-
ed using SPSS 22.
Results
Association Between Baseline Depression and 1-Year
Outcome
Baseline characteristics of the sample and treatment character-
istics are described in Table 1. Overall, CO-verified 1-year
abstinence was 37.1%. Overall, 29.7% of the sample reported
at least some level of depression, and 444 patients (13.1%)
were taking antidepressants at baseline. Bivariate analysis re-
sults indicate that in comparison with patients without depres-
sion, patients with mild depression (OR = 0.71; 95% CI: 0.58
to 0.87, p = 0.01) were less likely to be abstinent and patients
who reported moderate to severe depression were consider-
ably less likely to be abstinent (OR = 0.51; 95% CI: 0.41 to
0.63, p < 0.001). These associations remained very similar in
adjusted analysis (Table 1). Higher education, being married
and lower dependence were also associated with increased
abstinence; gender, age and other mental health problems
were not significantly associated with abstinence (Table 1).
Compared with those not taking any pharmacotherapy, pa-
tients taking any type of pharmacotherapy were more likely
to be abstinent, with the exception of the small groups of those
using a combination of NRT and varenicline or ‘other’ com-
binations where differences were not significant (Table 1).
More visits during the year increased odds of abstinence, par-
ticularly having had 5 or more visits was associated with vast-
ly increased odds of abstinence at the 1-year follow-up
(Table 1). In the additional model including interaction terms,
there was no evidence of an interaction between gender and
baseline level of depression (gender * mild depression:
OR = 1.23, 95% CI: 0.77 to 1.98, p = 0.40;
gender * moderate/severe depression: OR = 1.24, 95% CI:
0.76 to 2.04, p = 0.39).
In the models replacing level of depression with antidepres-
sant use, patients using antidepressants at baseline were mar-
ginally less likely to be abstinent at 1 year than those not using
antidepressants (32.9% versus 37.7%, OR = 0.81, 95% CI:
0.65 to 0.999, p = 0.049). This association was similar in
adjusted analysis, albeit with a wider confidence interval
crossing 1 (OR = 0.79, 95% CI: 0.62 to 1.01, p = 0.061).
The associations of other predictors were very similar to those
in the primary model.
When adding length of pharmacotherapy to the primary
model (Table 2), the results for mild and moderate/severe de-
pression were very similar to each other. Longer use of phar-
macotherapy use was associated with increased abstinence.
For pharmacotherapy, the reference category in this model
was NRT; patients on a combination of NRT and varenicline
or using any of the options in the mixed other category were
less likely to be abstinent than those using NRT; other differ-
ences were not significant. The ORs associated with a higher
number of visits were not as large as in the main model, but
the number of visits remained a strong predictor of abstinence
(Table 2). No significant interaction was found for length of
pharmacotherapy * type of pharmacotherapy (all p ≥ 0.05).
Change in Depression
The majority of patients with depression at baseline who
remained abstinent from smoking reported improvements in
their level of depression, while only a very small minority
reported a higher level of depression at follow-up (Fig. 1,
χ2 = 100.1, p < 0.001). Across all successful patients, mean
(SD) BDI-II scores improved significantly from 9.2 (8.6) to
5.3 (6.1); t(834) = 14.6, p < 0.001. The median decreased
significantly from 7 to 3 (Wilcoxon signed-rank Z = −14.1,
p < 0.001; sign test Z = −12.9, p < 0.001).
The mixed model ANOVA assessing the change in depres-
sion by baseline level of depression indicated large significant
main effects of time (F(1, 832) = 880.8, p < 0.001, partial
η2 = 0.51) and baseline level of depression (F(2,
832) = 666.4, p < 0.001, partial η2 = 0.62) and a significant
depression * time interaction (F(2832) = 296.5, p < 0.001,
partial η2 = 0.42; Fig. 2). Median scores decreased significant-
ly from baseline to follow-up for those with no/minimal de-
pression (from 5 to 3, Wilcoxon Z = −8.4, sign Z = −8.4, both
p < 0.001), mild depression (from 16 to 7, Wilcoxon Z = −7.8,
sign Z = −7.5, both p < 0.001) and moderate/severe depression
(from 25 to 10, Wilcoxon Z = −8.1, sign Z = −8.2, both
p < 0.001).
The mixed model ANOVA assessing the change in depres-
sion by pharmacotherapy indicated a small significant main
effect of pharmacotherapy (F(5, 829) = 12.34, p < 0.001, par-
tial η2 = 0.07) and a significant interaction of pharmacothera-
py with time (F(5, 829) = 3.47, p = 0.004, partial η2 = 0.02),
illustrated by a steep gradient for those on bupropion (Fig. 3).
Discussion
In a cohort of patients undergoing smoking cessation treat-
ment, patients with depression at the beginning of treatment
were less likely to have successfully stopped smoking a year
later than patients without depression, and this association
remained when adjusting for a number of demographic and
treatment characteristics. Those who had stopped successfully
reported an improvement in depression; this was true across
all levels of depression and those with moderate to severe
depression reported the most pronounced improvement.
The reduction in abstinence predicted by depressive symp-
toms is in line with previous research [12–14, 17]. There was

 no evidence of differential effects by gender as found in pre-
vious studies [16, 17]. As in previous findings on effective-
ness [31] and efficacy [32], pharmacotherapy use in this clinic
mostly predicted higher abstinence than no medication. This
included the antidepressant bupropion for which a recent
Cochrane review found only weak evidence of efficacy in
smokers with past depression and no clear evidence in
smokers with current depression [33]. It is striking that use
of pharmacotherapy well beyond the recommended 8 to
12 weeks of use is associated with continuing improvements
in abstinence.
The findings on a reduction in depressive symptoms in
those who abstain from smoking also support previous find-
ings from a small clinical study [10] and are in line with

 findings of a meta-analysis [9]. Although reduction differed
by medication, we found no evidence of a particularly strong
effect of varenicline as previously described [12].
The present findings extend the evidence on the association
between depression and subsequent smoking abstinence by
focusing on the current level of depression diagnosed using
a validated and well-established measure and by including
mild depression as well as more severe depression [16]. In
an earlier sample from the clinic used in the present study, a
history of depression was not associated with abstinence [24],
underlining the importance of assessment of depressive
symptoms close to the quit attempt. The present study includ-
ed patients on antidepressants at baseline and found only a
very weak association with abstinence, indicating that this is
a less sensitive measure than actual depression level. Other
strengths include the large sample and that data were routinely
collected in clinical practice from a clinic with a high success
rate and 1-year follow-up with low attrition rates, thereby
extending the evidence base beyond controlled trials and sur-
veys. The present analysis provides further support for the
hypothesis that smoking cessation may lead to improvements
in depression [9].

 Limitations of the present study include that all patients were
seen as outpatients, potentially reducing the generalisability to
patients so ill that they would be hospitalised. Importantly, the
findings on changes in depression have to be considered in the
light of the limitation that we were not able to include informa-
tion on depression at follow-up in those who did not stop
smoking and therefore could not compare changes in depres-
sion symptoms between those who were and were not absti-
nent. It is possible that patients who did not stop smoking
would have experienced a similar improvement in depression
symptoms. Also, depression measures could only be included
at two time points, not allowing us to make statements about
the direction of the association; it is possible that those who
stopped smoking subsequently experienced improvements in
depression symptoms or that patients who experienced an im-
provement in depression were more likely subsequently to stop
smoking. However, a recent meta-analysis suggests that the
latter explanation is less likely [9].
Future research should assess the change in depression
symptoms in smokers who attempt to stop smoking but are
not successful. Previous data from small cessation trials [34,
35] and recent data from population surveys suggested that
relapse in a quit attempt may predict an increase in depressive
symptoms [36].

 The steep gradient of success rates linked to the number of
visits is notable. Although attenuated by the length of phar-
macotherapy use, it remained the strongest predictor of absti-
nence. In previous analysis of a smaller sample from the clin-
ic, varenicline was associated with higher rates of abstinence
even after adjusting for other variables [37]. The difference in
odds between these medications in the present adjusted anal-
ysis was much smaller, and exploratory post hoc analyses
indicated that this was due to the addition of number of visits
as predictor. Although the possibility of reverse causality
(those being successful more likely to attend subsequent
visits) should not be discounted, this suggests that the face-
to-face visits contain a high concentration of active ingredi-
ents. Future research could aim to code the content of sessions
delivered in the clinic using existing taxonomies [38, 39] and
assess associations of components with outcomes [40, 41].
This would enable replication of effective components in oth-
er health care services and clinics and help improve long-term
smoking abstinence in those receiving support.
Conclusions
In this successful smoking cessation clinic, depression at the
start of treatment predicted reduced smoking abstinence at
1 year. The number of treatment sessions attended was a par-
ticularly strong predictor of abstinence. Patients who were
abstinent from smoking reported considerable improvement
in depression and this was true for all levels of depression.
