Effect of antihypertensive treatment at different blood pressure 
levels in patients with diabetes mellitus: systematic review and 
meta-analyses
Mattias Brunström, Bo Carlberg
ABSTRACT
ObjeCtive
To assess the effect of antihypertensive treatment on 
mortality and cardiovascular morbidity in people with 
diabetes mellitus, at different blood pressure levels.
Design
Systematic review and meta-analyses of randomised 
controlled trials.
Data sOurCes
CENTRAL, Medline, Embase, and BIOSIS were 
searched using highly sensitive search strategies. 
When data required according to the protocol were 
missing but trials were potentially eligible, we 
contacted researchers, pharmaceutical companies, 
and authorities.
eligibility Criteria
Randomised controlled trials including 100 or more 
people with diabetes mellitus, treated for 12 months or 
more, comparing any antihypertensive agent against 
placebo, two agents against one, or different blood 
pressure targets.
results
49 trials, including 73 738 participants, were included 
in the meta-analyses. Most of the participants had 
type 2 diabetes. If baseline systolic blood pressure 
was greater than 150 mm Hg, antihypertensive 
treatment reduced the risk of all cause mortality 
(relative risk 0.89, 95% confidence interval 0.80 to 
0.99), cardiovascular mortality (0.75, 0.57 to 0.99), 
myocardial infarction (0.74, 0.63 to 0.87), stroke (0.77, 
0.65 to 0.91), and end stage renal disease (0.82, 0.71 
to 0.94). If baseline systolic blood pressure was 
140-150 mm Hg, additional treatment reduced the risk 
of all cause mortality (0.87, 0.78 to 0.98), myocardial 
infarction (0.84, 0.76 to 0.93), and heart failure (0.80, 
0.66 to 0.97). If baseline systolic blood pressure was 
less than 140 mm Hg, however, further treatment 
increased the risk of cardiovascular mortality (1.15, 
1.00 to 1.32), with a tendency towards an increased 
risk of all cause mortality (1.05, 0.95 to 1.16). 
Metaregression analyses showed a worse treatment 
effect with lower baseline systolic blood pressures for 
cardiovascular mortality (1.15, 1.03 to 1.29 for each 10 
mm Hg lower systolic blood pressure) and myocardial 
infarction (1.12, 1.03 to 1.22 for each 10 mm Hg lower 
systolic blood pressure). Patterns were similar for 
attained systolic blood pressure.
COnClusiOns
Antihypertensive treatment reduces the risk of 
mortality and cardiovascular morbidity in people with 
diabetes mellitus and a systolic blood pressure more 
than 140 mm Hg. If systolic blood pressure is less than 
140 mm Hg, however, further treatment is associated 
with an increased risk of cardiovascular death, with no 
observed benefit.
Introduction
Blood pressure goals in people with diabetes mellitus 
have been extensively debated during the past 
decade.1-3 For many years, guidelines have recom-
mended treating patients to achieve a blood pressure of 
less than 130/80 mm Hg.4-6  Systematic reviews have 
questioned the evidence for these recommendations.7 
8 
 
During 2013 multiple hypertension guidelines were 
updated.9-11  Generally, the treatment goals for people 
with diabetes were changed to less than 140/90 mm Hg, 
but some guidelines still opt for lower targets in certain 
patient groups.9 12  Last year, a new systematic review 
was published,13 concluding that treating people with a 
systolic blood pressure (SBP) already less than 140 mm 
Hg is associated with a reduced risk of stroke and albu-
minuria, and therefore challenged the relaxation of 
guidelines. All previous systematic reviews only anal-
ysed previously published data.7

We assessed the effect of blood pressure lowering 
treatment in people with diabetes mellitus, including 
previously unpublished data. Although people with 
diabetes have been included in many trials of blood 
pressure lowering treatment, for most of these trials 
data on people with diabetes have not been published 
separately. We contacted authors, pharmaceutical com-
panies, and authorities to get access to this data. To 
assess the effect of treatment at different blood pressure 
levels, we stratified meta-analyses according to

baseline and attained SBP. Baseline SBP is important 
because it reflects the clinical situation better than 
attained SBP. Although blood pressure before treatment 
is known, the attained blood pressure with treatment 
may vary substantially. Also, attained SBP can be 
regarded as a product of baseline SBP and SBP lower-
ing. Therefore, trials included in each stratum will be 
more homogenous for clinical characteristics if stratifi-
cation is based on baseline values.
Methods
We conducted a systematic review and meta-analyses 
guided by recommendations of the Cochrane Collabora-
tion.14 The methods, including search strategy, inclu-
sion criteria, and preliminary analyses were 
prespecified (see web appendix for protocol). We 
included randomised controlled trials with a mean fol-
low-up of 12 months or more and including 100 or more 
participants with diabetes mellitus. Trials had to com-
pare any antihypertensive agent against placebo, any 
two agents against one, or any blood pressure target 
against another. We excluded strictly comparative tri-
als, evaluating one agent against another, as well as 
trials with combined interventions.
During February 2013, we searched CENTRAL, Med-
line, Embase, and BIOSIS using broad strategies to 
maximise sensitivity. CENTRAL was searched using the 
MeSH terms “antihypertensive agent” and “blood pres-
sure”, exploded and combined, without restrictions in 
publication year or language (see the web appendix for 
full search strategies in each database). We also 
browsed reference lists in, and citations of, systematic 
reviews and guidelines in the discipline, including a 
more recently updated review.7 8 13 15-17  Using EndNote 
reference software, we combined the search results and 
removed duplicate records. MB screened titles and 
abstracts to exclude apparently irrelevant publications. 
Both authors independently checked the abstracts and 
full text articles for eligibility and resolved any dis-
agreements by discussion. Data were extracted into 
specially designed Excel sheets, pretested on 10 
included trials and then modified to increase function-
ality. Risk of bias was assessed at study level using the 
Cochrane Collaboration’s risk of bias tool.18 Both 
authors independently extracted data and assessed risk 
of bias, with disagreements resolved by a recheck of the 
original data and discussion.
Prespecified outcomes of interest were all cause 
mortality, cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular 
mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, 
end stage renal disease, amputation, blindness, 
adverse events, and quality of life. Given the poor 
reporting of adverse events and quality of life in the 
original trials, we excluded these outcomes before 
extraction of any data. We collected data on baseline 
characteristics at trial level and blood pressure data 
for the intervention and control groups separately. 
When any data required according to the protocol 
were missing, but the trial was potentially eligible, 
we contacted the authors. If they did not respond to 
the first email, we reminded them at least once. Where 
data were available, we calculated relative risks for 
each outcome in each trial, and pooled results using 
random effects meta-analysis. We chose the random 
effects model over the fixed effects model because the 
included trials differed to some extent, both clinically 
and methodologically. The results of random and fixed 
effects models in analyses with low heterogeneity are 
the same, and if heterogeneity is present the random 
effects model is generally more conservative. We per-
formed non-stratified meta-analyses for all outcomes, 
based on all trials. Prespecified stratified analyses 
were performed based on mean baseline SBP and dia-
stolic blood pressure (DBP) in all participants, mean 
in-treatment SBP and DBP for the intervention group, 
and mean differences in SBP and DBP between groups 
during follow-up. Cochran Q statistics were used to 
assess the interaction between blood pressure levels 
and treatment effect on outcomes, testing the null 
hypothesis that there is no difference between groups. 
We carried out prespecified metaregression analyses 
between each blood pressure variable and the treat-
ment effect on each outcome.
In the stratified analyses, we excluded trials predom-
inantly including patients with heart failure because of 
the risk of assessing effects independent of blood pres-
sure. Also, we were unable to stratify analyses of ampu-
tation and blindness because too few trials reported 
these outcomes. The blood pressure strata were slightly 
modified from those given in the protocol. For reasons 
of power, we excluded the baseline stratum for SBP less 
than 135 mm Hg and for attained SBP greater than 150 
mm Hg. DBP stratification was done to achieve as equal 
a number of trials in each stratum as possible. Because 
SBP has the strongest association with cardiovascular 
disease, explaining more than 95% of events,19 we 
report on this in the review. DBP is problematic because 
it might be confounded by differences in pulse pres-
sure, as seen between included trials. (See web appen-
dix for analyses stratified according to DBP and to 
differences in SBP and DBP between groups.)
Heterogeneity was assessed by visually inspecting 
the forest plots, and through I2 statistics. When hetero-
geneity was present, we scrutinised baseline character-
istics, blood pressure data, and risk of bias assessments 
of the included trials for possible explanations. If such 
explanations were found, we carried out sensitivity 
analyses if we suspected a potential effect on the main 
results. Publication bias was assessed using funnel 
plots for all outcomes separately, and for mortality in 
the stratified analyses. Analyses were performed using 
STATA v12.
Patient involvement
No patients were involved in setting the research ques-
tion or the outcome measures, nor were they involved in 
developing plans for design or implementation of the 
study. No patients were asked to advice on interpreta-
tion or writing up of results. Since we used only aggre-
gated data from previous trials, we are unable to 
disseminate the results of the research to study partici-
pants directly.

Results
Overall, 49 trials corresponding to 73 738 participants 
fulfilled the inclusion criteria and provided enough data 
to be included in at least one meta-analysis (fig 1 ).20-72 
 
Twenty five trials (26 625 participants) comprised dia-
betic subgroups from larger trials, and 24  
trials (47 113 
participants) were confined to people with diabetes. 
Unpublished data for 12 studies (8916 participants) were 
obtained through contact with the authors, pharmaceu-
tical companies, or  
authorities.30

72  The 
mean duration of follow-up was 3.7 years, and most of 
the participants had type 2 diabetes. Table 1 lists the 
characteristics of the included studies, including 
 
comorbidities.
Figures 2 and 3  present the meta-analyses stratified 
according to baseline SBP and attained SBP, 
 
respectively. The mean difference in SBP between base-
line and follow-up in the intervention groups was 10.2 
mm Hg. Because of this, the trials included in each 
baseline SBP strata generally ended up in the strata for 
10 mm Hg lower attained SBP. Figure 4 presents the 
metaregression analyses for baseline SBP.
All cause mortality was reduced if SBP before treat-
ment was more than 140 mm Hg and if SBP with treat-
ment was 130-140 mm Hg. If baseline SBP was less than 
140 mm Hg, the point estimate shifted towards an 
increased risk with treatment, albeit not statistically 
significant (relative risk 1.05, 95% confidence interval 
0.95 to 1.16). The same trend was observed if attained 
SBP was less than 130 mm Hg. Both baseline and 
attained SBP significantly interacted with treatment 
effect on all cause mortality (P=0.019 and 0.009, respec-
tively), indicating that the treatment effect is worse with 
lower SBP.
Cardiovascular mortality was reduced if baseline SBP 
was more than 150 mm Hg. If baseline SBP was 140-150 
mm Hg, the effect of treatment was not significant, and 
if baseline SBP was less than 140 mm Hg, treatment 
increased the risk of cardiovascular death by 15% 
 
(relative risk 1.15, 95% confidence interval 1.00 to 1.32). 
Results were not significant for the attained SBP 
 
analyses but showed similar patterns, towards risk 
reduction if SBP was more than 130 mm Hg and towards 
harm if SBP was less than 130 mm Hg. Both baseline 
and attained SBP significantly interacted with the effect 
of treatment in the same direction as for all cause mor-
tality (P=0.002 and 0.010, respectively). Metaregression 
analyses showed 15 percentage points worse treatment 
effect on cardiovascular mortality for each 10 mm Hg 
lower baseline SBP (P=0.015), crossing the zero line 
from benefit towards harm at 141 mm Hg.
For myocardial infarction, treatment was beneficial if 
baseline SBP was more than 140 mm Hg and attained 
SBP was more than 130 mm Hg. If SBP was less than 140 
mm Hg at baseline or less than 130 mm Hg during treat-
ment, however, there was no association between treat-
ment and risk. Interaction was significant between 
baseline SBP and treatment effect, but not for attained 
SBP (P=0.017 and P=0.476, respectively). Metaregres-
sion showed 12 percentage points worse treatment 
effect on myocardial infarction for each 10 mm Hg lower 
baseline SBP (P=0.011), crossing from benefit towards 
harm at 132 mm Hg.
The risk of stroke was reduced if baseline SBP was 
more than 140 mm Hg and attained SBP was less than 
140 mm Hg. The lowest SBP stratum, for both baseline 
and attained SBP, had wide confidence intervals, 
reflecting low numbers of events. Both interaction anal-
yses and metaregression analyses were not significant 
for both baseline and attained SBP.
The risk of heart failure decreased with treatment if 
baseline SBP was more than 140 mm Hg and attained 
SBP was more than 130 mm Hg. For the lowest stratum, 
however, the effect of treatment was not significant. For 
end stage renal disease, the only subgroup showing a 
positive effect of treatment was that with a baseline SBP 
of more than 150 mm Hg. For both the baseline and 
attained analyses, the point estimate in the lowest 
strata was close to 1. Interaction tests and metaregres-
sion analyses were negative for heart failure and end 
stage renal disease.
The web appendix presents non-stratified meta-anal-
yses, meta-analyses stratified according to baseline and 
in-treatment DBP, and meta-analyses stratified accord-
ing to differences in SBP and DBP between groups. We 
observed similar patterns in the DBP analyses as in the 
SBP analyses. There was a significant interaction 
between baseline and attained DBP and cardiovascular 
mortality. Metaregression showed the risk of cardiovas-
cular mortality to increase by 28 percentage points for 
each 10 mm Hg lower baseline DBP (P=0.013), crossing 
from benefit towards harm at 78 mm Hg. Non-cardio-
vascular mortality was analysed according to protocol, 
and was not affected by treatment in any subgroup.
The web appendix presents risk of bias assessment, 
with explanatory text.
In our overall meta-analyses we judged the risk of 
bias as low, although it was high for some trials. One 
trial (DIabetic REtinopathy Candesartan Trials-Protect 2, 
DIRECT-P2) was judged to have high risk of bias in

three domains. We performed sensitivity analyses 
excluding this trial from the stratified analyses. This 
shifted the effect measures of all cause and cardiovas-
cular mortality slightly more towards harm, but did not 
change the significance level for any outcome.
discussion
This systematic review and meta-analyses confirms 
that blood pressure lowering treatment is associated 
with reduced mortality and cardiovascular morbidity in 
people with diabetes mellitus, if systolic blood pressure 
(SBP) before treatment is more than 140 mm Hg. If SBP 
is less than 140 mm Hg, however, we found no benefit, 
but potential harm, with an increased risk of cardiovas-
cular death. This fits well with our analyses stratified by 
attained SBP. Treatment reduced the risk of all cause 
mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, and heart fail-
ure, if SBP was treated to 130-140 mm Hg, but was asso-
ciated with a non-significant increase in all cause and 
cardiovascular mortality if SBP was lowered to less 
than 130 mm Hg. The results are further supported by 
metaregression analyses showing that treatment effect 
on cardiovascular mortality and myocardial infarction 
is worse for each unit decrease in baseline SBP, and 
harmful below certain levels.
strengths and limitations of this review
This review has some limitations that are general to 
meta-analyses without access to individual patient 
data, including not being able to account for patient 
characteristics in a sophisticated way or analyse blood 
pressure levels within trials. Six other considerations 
should be borne in mind. Firstly, we identified more 
potentially eligible trials than could be included in the 
final analyses. These were trials in which we either 
knew there were people with diabetes but did not 
receive data on these participants, or trials in which 
there were no data on inclusion but participation by 
people with diabetes could not be excluded. Hence, 
despite our efforts, additional data exist that are not 
included in our analyses. Secondly, our analyses are 
stratified on mean baseline and attained blood pres-
sure within trials. This is an aggregated variable, which 
opens our results to potential ecological bias. One way 
to reduce this risk of bias would have been to stratify on 
eligibility criteria or blood pressure targets instead of 
on measured values. However, the blood pressure range 
accepted in each trial is usually wide, with great over-
lap between trials, making stratification on this vari-
able virtually impossible. Thirdly, we see no increase in 
the risk of myocardial infarction or stroke, correspond-
ing to the increase in cardiovascular mortality in the 
lowest SBP strata. This could have two possible expla-
nations. Case fatality might increase with intensive 
treatment, reflecting lower margins to handle an event 
with lower blood pressure. It could also reflect stricter 
definitions for myocardial infarction and stroke in the 
included trials than those used for cardiovascular mor-
tality. For example, all unexpected deaths, deaths out 
of hospital, and deaths without known causes, usually 
qualify as cardiovascular mortality, but not as any

specific event. Fourthly, most of the included trials were 
not designed to test different blood pressure targets but 
rather randomised patients to drug versus placebo. 
Thus, if blood pressure independent drug effects were 
present, they could affect our results. A recent system-
atic review showed no difference in treatment effect 
between drug classes for all cause and cardiovascular 
mortality.73  Also, all trials that randomised patients to 
specific drugs in the lowest blood pressure strata used 
renin angiotensin system (RAS) blockers. It has been 
suggested that these agents have a positive effect 
beyond that of blood pressure lowering,48  but still the 
main results in this stratum were negative. It is thus 
unlikely that the observed treatment effects in this 
review are related to drug class. Fifthly, the ALiskiren 
Trial In Type 2 Diabetes Using Cardio-Renal Endpoints 
(ALTITUDE) is given large weight in all meta-analyses 
within the baseline SBP stratum of less than 140 mm 
Hg. This was a trial of aliskiren, a renin inhibitor, in 
addition to previous inhibition of RAS.28  Double RAS 
blocker treatment is no longer recommended as stan-
dard treatment in any patient group.9-11 We therefore 
performed a sensitivity analysis, excluding ALTITUDE 
from the cardiovascular mortality analysis, to test its 
impact. Importantly, this did not change the point 
 
estimate but widened the confidence intervals, indicat-
ing that the treatment effect is consistent across trials 
but that the power to establish such an effect is insuffi-
cient without ALTITUDE. In line with this, the shift in 
significance for cardiovascular mortality and stroke, 
between the baseline and attained SBP analyses, can 
also be attributed to ALTITUDE. Although baseline SBP 
was less than 140 mm Hg, this trial did not lower SBP to 
below 130 mm Hg. Sixthly, the majority of participants 
in the included trials in our meta-analyses had type 2 
diabetes and were already treated with one or more 
antihypertensive agents. Therefore, generalisability to 
people with type 1 diabetes, and people naive to treat-
ment, is probably limited.
Comparison with other studies
Our results are mostly in line with those of a recently 
published review by Emdin and colleagues.13  Both 
reviews confirm the protective effect of treatment if SBP 
is more than 140 mm Hg, and that the benefit decreases 
with decreasing blood pressure. However, the results 
differ on three important findings. Firstly, we show an 
increased risk of cardiovascular death, an outcome not

analysed by Emdin and colleagues. Secondly, Emdin 
and colleagues showed a decreased risk of stroke, even 
if baseline SBP was less than 140 mm Hg, which we do 
not. Thirdly, Emdin and colleagues showed a decreased 
risk of albuminuria, an outcome we did not analyse. 
The reviews differ on two methodological points: we 
include data from 21 additional trials, compared with 
the stratified analyses in the previous review; and 
Emdin and colleagues standardised risk ratios and 
weights according to SBP reduction within trials, 
whereas we used non-standardised data. In the case of 
stroke, the difference in results between the two reviews 
can be explained by the standardisation used by Emdin 
and colleagues. In their standardised model, the Action 
to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) 
trial is given more than 90% weight in the meta-analy-
sis, although it contributed less than 25% of the events 
in the included trials.23  On the other hand, ALTITUDE is 
given only 2% weight in the meta-analysis, although it 
contributed more than 60% of the events.28  This 
strongly suggests a study weight bias in the 
 
standardised model. Albuminuria should be regarded 
as a surrogate for end stage renal disease. In our analy-
ses of trials with baseline SBP less than 140 mm Hg, 
there was no tendency towards reduction of this out-
come (relative risk 0.97
, 95% confidence interval 0.80 to 
1.17). Even if the best possible scenario, with respect to 
confidence intervals for end stage renal disease, was 
true, the absolute number of cardiovascular deaths 
exceeds that of end stage renal disease, and hence the 
numbers needed to treat would exceed the numbers 
needed to harm. The absence of a beneficial effect on 
stroke if baseline SBP is less than 140 mm Hg also dif-
fers compared with another review, including both peo-
ple with diabetes and people with impaired fasting 
glucose.8  It is reasonable to think that the vessels of 
people with impaired fasting glucose are less affected 
than those of people with manifest diabetes, and hence 
they might be less sensitive to, and perhaps more 
helped by, additional blood pressure  
lowering. 
Recently, the results of the Systolic Blood Pressure 
Intervention Trial (SPRINT) were published.74 This was 
a randomised controlled trial comparing a systolic 
blood pressure target of less than 120 mm Hg with one 
less than 140 mm Hg, in high risk patients with moder-
ately elevated blood pressure. The trial was stopped 
preterm owing to a highly significant reduction in all 
cause mortality, suggesting that this population might 
benefit from very aggressive blood pressure treatment. 
Importantly, patients with diabetes mellitus were 
excluded from the trial. Thus our results, combined 
with those from SPRINT, suggest that blood pressure 
treatment targets should be less aggressive in people 
with diabetes than in those without diabetes.
Potential explanation of findings
The concept of a J-shaped, or U-shaped, curve for the 
relation between blood pressure and cardiovascular 
disease has been shown previously in observational 
settings.75 76  This has often been dismissed as due to 
possible confounding.77 It is highly unlikely, however, 
that our results would be due to confounding. This is 
because we analyse relative risks between groups with 
the same baseline blood pressure but randomised to 
different blood pressure levels, thereby preserving the 
element of randomisation in our meta-analyses.
The most likely biological explanation for our findings 
is that intensive treatment impairs blood flow to end 
organs, leading to ischaemia.77  In patients with stenosis 
of the coronary arteries, decreased diastolic blood pres-
sure (DBP) has been shown to lead to lower fractional 
flow reserve over the stenosed segment, in turn leading to 
myocardial hypoperfusion.78  In arterial stiffening, com-
monly present in people with diabetes, myocardial perfu-
sion is increasingly dependent on SBP.79  This could, at 
least partly, explain the association between low SBP and 
worse treatment effect in our analyses. Impaired myocar-
dial perfusion, compared with the superior autoregula-
tion of cerebral blood flow, could also explain the 
different effects of blood pressure levels on myocardial 
infarction and stroke. Another potential explanation for 
our findings is that low blood pressure leads to less

coronary collateral circulation. It has been hypothesised 
that low blood pressure leads to reduced endothelial 
stress, the driver of arteriogenesis, and an association 
between DBP and coronary collaterals has been shown in 
cross sectional data of patients with coronary occlusion.80 
This could explain not only an increased number of 
events with treatment but also a worse prognosis when 
having an event, as reflected by the possible increase in 
case fatality suggested by our analyses.
Conclusions and implications
This systematic review and meta-analyses included a 
large amount of previously unpublished data, thereby 
increasing precision compared with previous research. 
Results from the analyses stratified by baseline SBP are 
largely consistent with those stratified by attained SBP. 
The interaction between blood pressure and treatment 
effect is reproducible across exposure variables and 
outcomes, indicating a robust dose-response relation. 
Together with a possible biological mechanism, our 
results suggest that SBP before treatment modifies the 
effect of treatment in a causal way.
The results are important both conceptually for 
research on hypertension and for clinicians. Firstly, we 
show that not only the absolute, but also the relative 
benefit of blood pressure lowering is attenuated at 
lower blood pressures. This suggests that the linear 
relation between blood pressure and cardiovascular 
disease seen in some observational studies cannot be 
extrapolated to assumed benefit of treatment. Stretch-
ing this further, we show, based on randomised com-
parisons, that treatment below a certain blood pressure 
level might be harmful. Secondly, and contrary to what 
has previously been recommended, our results, com-
bined with those from the SPRINT trial, suggest that 
blood pressure treatment goals should be less aggres-
sive in people with diabetes than without diabetes. This 
review strongly supports blood pressure treatment in 
people with diabetes mellitus if SBP is more than 140 
mm Hg. If SBP is already less than 140 mm Hg, however, 
adding additional agents might be harmful.
