BACKGROUND: Guidelines recommend that patients with low ejection 
fraction (EF) after myocardial infarction (MI) have their EF reassessed 40 
days after MI for implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) candidacy. This 
study examines rates of EF reassessment and their association with 1-year 
ICD implantation in post-MI patients with low EF.
METHODS: We examined rates of postdischarge EF reassessment and 
ICD implantation among 10 
289 Medicare-insured patients ≥65 years of 
age with an EF≤35% during the index MI admission from January 2007 
through September 2010 in ACTION Registry–GWTG (Acute Coronary 
Treatment and Intervention Outcomes Network Registry–Get With The 
Guidelines). Multivariable Cox models tested the association between 
time-dependent EF reassessment and 1-year ICD implantation, stratified by 
revascularization status during the index MI admission.
RESULTS: Among patients with EF ≤35% during the index MI admission, 
66.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 65.9–67.8) had EF reassessment 
within the next year. Revascularized patients were more likely to have 
EF reassessment (76.9% [95% CI, 75.8–78.0)] versus 53.7% [95% 
CI, 52.2–55.2]; P<0.001) and had shorter times to EF reassessment 
(median, 67 versus 84 days; P<0.001) than nonrevascularized patients. 
Among patients with EF reassessment, only 11% received an ICD within 
1 year. Reassessment of EF was associated with a higher likelihood 
of ICD implantation for both revascularized (unadjusted, 12.1% versus 
2.4%, P<0.001; adjusted hazard ratio, 10.6, 95% CI, 7.7–14.8) and 
nonrevascularized (unadjusted, 10.0% versus 1.7%, P<0.001; adjusted 
hazard ratio, 6.1, 95% CI, 4.1–9.2) patients.
CONCLUSIONS: In US practice, EF reassessments are commonly 
performed among patients with MI with an initially reduced EF. Although 
1-year EF reassessment is associated with increased likelihood of ICD 
implantation, 1-year ICD implantation rates remain very low even among 
patients with EF reassessment, regardless of revascularization status.

r
andomized, controlled, clinical trials have estab-
lished the benefit of primary prevention implantable 
cardioverter-defibrillators (ICD) among patients with 
low ejection fraction (EF).1,2 Although the risk of sudden 
cardiac death is highest early after MI in patients with low 
EF,3 studies have not demonstrated benefit with early ICD 
implantation after MI.4,5 The lack of benefit from early ICD 
implantation after MI may be attributed in part to the use of 
β-blockers,6 angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors,7 an-
giotensin receptor blockers,8 and aldosterone antagonists 
shown to prevent unfavorable remodeling or to promote 
recovery of low EF.9 Revascularization has also been shown 
to improve the EF in patients with ischemic cardiomyopa-
thy.10,11 Current guidelines give a Class IA recommendation 
for primary prevention ICD implantation among patients 40 
days after MI if the EF remains ≤35% despite optimal medi-
cal therapy.12,13 The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Ser-
vices preclude reimbursement for primary prevention ICD 
implantation within 90 days of revascularization.14
Existing evidence suggests underuse of ICDs in rou-
tine clinical practice,15 especially among patients with 
low EF after an acute MI.16,17 Given the need to wait for 
40 to 90 days after an MI, consideration of an ICD is 
susceptible to errors of omission during the transition 
of post-MI care between inpatient and outpatient care 
teams.18,19 A previous study showed that readmissions 
for MI or heart failure were strongly associated with ICD 
implantation.17 Reassessment of the EF may represent 
the intent or a reminder to consider the patient’s candi-
dacy for ICD therapy.16
Therefore, we examined a large, community-based 
sample of patients >65 years of age with acute MI 
and EF ≤35% to evaluate the incidence and timing of 
EF reassessment among post-MI patients stratified by 
revascularization status, to describe the association of 
EF reassessment and ICD implantation, and to compare 
the association between inpatient versus outpatient EF 
reassessment and ICD implantation. We hypothesized 
that EF reassessments were underperformed among 
older post-MI patients and that EF reassessment would 
be associated with a higher likelihood of ICD implantation 
regardless of revascularization status. The intent of our 
study is to identify opportunities to optimize ICD use in 
eligible post-MI patients.
MethODs
study Population
The 
ACTION 
Registry–GWTG 
(National 
Cardiovascular 
Data Registry Acute Coronary Treatment and Intervention 
Outcomes Network Registry–Get With The Guidelines) is a qual-
ity improvement program in the United States that includes 
consecutive patients with ST-segment–elevation MI (STEMI) 
or non-STEMI.20,21 The ACTION Registry–GWTG did not col-
lect unique patient identifiers, so we used 5 indirect identifiers 
in combination (date of birth, sex, hospital identifier, date of 
admission, date of discharge) to link patients >65 years of 
age in this registry to their Centers for Medicare & Medicaid 
Services claims record.22 The linked data set included 72 
439 
patients who were eligible for Medicare Part A and Part B fee-
for-service plans during the index admission discharge month 
and received acute MI care at 484 hospitals between January 
2, 2007, and September 30, 2010.
As Figure 1 shows, we excluded patients who were not eli-
gible for Medicare Part A and Part B fee-for-service plans for 
at least 12 consecutive months before the index admission 
(n=4427) because the Medicare claims data were needed to 
determine whether an ICD was previously implanted and to 
assess comorbid conditions not captured in ACTION Registry–
GWTG for risk adjustment. Patients were then excluded if they 
died during the index admission (n=5065), if they did not have an 
EF measurement (n=7748), or if their EF was >35% (n=41 
579) 
during the index hospitalization. Patients who had a same-day 
discharge, transferred to another hospital, were discharged to 
clinical Perspective
What is new? 
• We examined rates of postdischarge ejection frac-
tion (EF) reassessment and implantable cardio-
verter-defibrillator (ICD) implantation among 10 
289 
Medicare-insured patients ≥65 years old with an 
EF ≤35% during an index myocardial infarction (MI) 
admission in the ACTION Registry–GWTG (Acute 
Coronary Treatment and Intervention Outcomes Net-
work Registry–Get With The Guidelines).
• Cumulative incidence of EF reassessment within 1 
year of MI was 66.8%.
• Within the first year after MI, 11% of patients who 
had an EF reassessment underwent ICD implanta-
tion, which was significantly higher than for patients 
without EF reassessment.
• After multivariable adjustment, EF reassessment 
remained significantly associated with a higher 
likelihood of ICD implantation within 1 year in both 
revascularized (hazard ratio, 10.6; 95% confidence 
interval, 7.7–14.8) and nonrevascularized (haz-
ard ratio, 6.1; 95% confidence interval, 4.1–9.2) 
patients.
What are the clinical implications? 
• It is reasonable to reassess the EF 40 days after 
MI in nonrevascularized patients and 90 days after 
revascularization in revascularized patients.
• Findings in this post-MI Medicare population support 
early cardiology follow-up for all patients with MI.
• On the basis of our findings, we recommend all 
patients who are potential candidates for ICD 
therapy be routinely scheduled for follow-up outpa-
tient EF reassessment before hospital discharge to 
bridge the currently observed gaps in care.
• The decision to implant an ICD in patients with a low 
EF needs to be individualized on the basis of patient 
comorbidities, life expectancy, and patient wishes.

hospice, left against medical advice, or requested comfort care 
(n=1476) were excluded. We then excluded patients with prior 
ICD implantation or ICD implantation during the index admis-
sion (n=1575) using a combination of Current Procedural 
Terminology and International Classification of Diseases, Ninth 
Revision codes indicative of ICD implantation or device moni-
toring in Medicare claims data (Table I in the online-only Data 
Supplement). For patients with multiple MI admissions during 
the study period, the first admission was the start of follow-up, 
and registry records for readmitted MIs were excluded to avoid 
double counting (251 records excluded). Finally, patients were 
excluded because of missing in-hospital revascularization data 
or an EF reassessment billed after death (n=29).
Definitions
Patients were classified as revascularized if they had a percu-
taneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass graft 
reported in ACTION Registry–GWTG. Reassessment of EF was 
determined by Current Procedural Terminology codes for echo-
cardiogram, nuclear cardiology studies (including myocardial 
perfusion imaging single-photon emission computed tomog-
raphy, multiple gated acquisition scan, and positron emission 
tomography), cardiovascular magnetic resonance, left ventric-
ulography, and cardiovascular computed tomography (Table II 
in the online-only Data Supplement). Encounter setting modi-
fiers in the Medicare carrier data were used to define the EF 
reassessment as taking place in the inpatient or outpatient set-
ting. Patients with the first Current Procedural Terminology or 
International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision code for 
ICD insertion after the index discharge were classified as hav-
ing received an ICD (Table I in the online-only Data Supplement).
statistical analyses
On the basis of the a priori assumption that the clinical 
approach to EF reassessment would vary by revascularization 
status during the index admission, all analyses were stratified 
on the basis of revascularization status. Descriptive baseline 
characteristics for patients who survived 1 year after MI were 
summarized as frequencies with percentages for categori-
cal variables and medians with 25th and 75th percentiles for 
continuous variables. Differences between patients with and 
without an EF reassessment within 1 year after discharge were 
compared by use of the χ2 test for categorical variables and 
Wilcoxon rank-sum test for continuous variables. The incidence 
of EF reassessment was influenced directly by the competing 
risk for mortality; therefore, we estimated the cumulative inci-
dence of EF reassessment within 1 year after discharge and 
compared the incidence between revascularized and nonrevas-
cularized patients using the Gray test.23
A Cox proportional hazards model was performed to test 
for interhospital variation in the rates of 1-year EF reassess-
ment, with adjustment for baseline patient characteristics with-
out time-dependent covariates (Table III in the online-only Data 
Supplement) as fixed effects and discharging hospital as a ran-
dom effect. For this analysis of hospital variation, only hospi-
tals with >10 patients (179 hospitals, 8192 patients) enrolled 
in the registry were analyzed. Because interhospital variation 
was present, a multivariable hierarchical logistic regression 
model for EF reassessment within 1 year was used to gener-
ate an estimated distribution of EF reassessment rates across 
hospitals among the 6615 patients who remained eligible 
for Medicare Part A and Part B fee-for-service at 1 year after 
discharge.
We assessed the 1-year cumulative incidence of ICD implan-
tation among patients in the overall population with and without 
1-year EF reassessment stratified by revascularized and nonre-
vascularized patients. A multivariable Cox model (Table III in the 
online-only Data Supplement) stratified by discharging hospital 
was fit to quantify the association between EF reassessment 
within 1 year of MI as a time-dependent covariate and ICD 
implantation within 1 year, with censoring at the time of death 
or end of Medicare Part A and Part B fee-for-service eligibility.
On the basis of the assumption that outpatient EF reassess-
ments may be more likely ordered with a focus on assess-
ing ICD candidacy, in contrast to inpatient EF reassessments, 
which may be performed for other reasons related more to 
the rehospitalization, we performed a sensitivity analysis to 
explore the association between time-dependent 1-year EF 
reassessment occurring in the inpatient versus the outpatient 
setting and 1-year ICD implantation. A multivariable Cox model 
was used, with adjustment for the same covariates listed in 
Table III in the online-only Data Supplement. We then tested 
whether the time-dependent indicator for outpatient EF reas-
sessment was significant in a model that already included 
time-dependent overall (outpatient or inpatient) EF reassess-
ment; this determined whether the setting of EF reassessment 
(outpatient versus inpatient) changed its association with ICD 
implantation within 1 year.
Missing data were <1% for all variables except body mass 
index (1.8%) and peak troponin (6.3%). Missing values in con-
tinuous covariates were imputed to MI type (STEMI versus 
non-STEMI) and sex-specific medians of the nonmissing values. 
Missing values for categorical variables were imputed to the 
most frequent group. All statistical analyses were performed 
with SAS software (version 9.3, SAS Institute, Cary, NC). The

resUlts
rates of eF reassessment
Among 10 
289 patients >65 years of age with an EF 
≤35% at the time of the index hospitalization for MI, the 
cumulative incidence of EF reassessment within 1 year of 
MI was 66.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 65.9–67.8). 
EF reassessments were performed more frequently 
among patients who received revascularization during 
the index MI hospitalization (76.9%; 95% CI, 75.8–78.0) 
than among nonrevascularized patients (53.7%; 95% CI, 
52.2–55.2). The median time from MI to EF reassess-
ment in revascularized patients was 67 days (25th and 
75th percentiles, 31 and 134 days), and the time from 
MI to EF reassessment was longer in nonrevascularized 
patients at 84 days (25th and 75th percentiles, 34 and 
198 days; P<0.001; Figure 2).
The 1-year mortality rate in the overall population was 
24% (2466). Among patients who survived 1 year after 
discharge, patients who had an EF reassessment within 
that year were younger and more likely to present with 
a STEMI than patients who did not have an EF reassess-
ment, regardless of revascularization status (Table 1). 
Patients ≥80 years of age made up 44% of the overall 
population. Comorbidities were more common in patients 
without EF reassessment with higher rates of hyperten-
sion and prior heart failure regardless of revasculariza-
tion status than in patients with EF reassessment. Among 
revascularized patients, prior MI (30% versus 25%), prior 
percutaneous coronary intervention (28% versus 23%), 
and prior coronary artery bypass graft (22% versus 13%) 
were all more prevalent in patients without EF reassess-
ment than in those with EF reassessment (P<0.001 for 
all), and peak troponin levels were higher in patients with 
an EF reassessment (median, 99 versus 65 times the up-
per limit of normal; P<0.001) than in those without an EF 
reassessment. Revascularized patients with EF reassess-
ment had higher rates of angiotensin-converting enzyme 
inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker and aldosterone 
antagonist use at discharge; the rate of aldosterone an-
tagonist use was low (10%) in all patients regardless of 
revascularization status.
hospital Variation in eF reassessment
After adjustment for differences in patient case mix 
across hospitals, there was marginal but statistically 
significant interhospital variation in rates of EF reas-
sessment within 1 year of MI by discharging hospital 
(P=0.004) with an estimated median EF reassessment 
rate of 75% (25th and 75th percentiles, 72% and 78%) 
among revascularized patients. On the basis of this es-
timated distribution, revascularized patients at hospitals 
in the 90th percentile for EF reassessment (80.4%) were 
only 1.2-fold more likely to have their EF reassessed 
than patients at hospitals in the 10th percentile (68.5%). 
There was no significant interhospital variation in the 
rates of postdischarge EF reassessment among nonre-
vascularized patients (P=0.07); the estimated median 
EF reassessment rate was 74% (25th and 75th percen-
tiles, 72% and 76%) for nonrevascularized patients.
association Between eF reassessment and  
icD Use
Within the first year after MI, 11% of patients who had 
an EF reassessment underwent ICD implantation; ICD im-
plantation rates were only slightly higher among patients 
who were revascularized (12.1%; 95% CI, 11.1–13.1) 
than among patients who were not revascularized during

the MI admission (10.0%; 95% CI, 8.8–11.3; P<0.001). 
One-year ICD implantation rates were significantly lower 
among patients without EF reassessment: 2.4% (95% CI, 
1.7–3.4) for revascularized patients and 1.7% (95% CI, 
1.2–2.3) for nonrevascularized patients. Among patients 
who received an ICD during the entire follow-up period af-
ter MI, 83% had their EF reassessed before ICD implan-
tation; this rate was 90% (595 of 663 patients) among 
revascularized patients and 69% (209 of 302 patients)

cularized patients and 31 days (25th and 75th percen-
tiles, 2 and 111 days) for nonrevascularized patients. Af-
ter multivariable adjustment, EF reassessment remained 
significantly associated with a higher likelihood of ICD 
implantation within 1 year in both revascularized (hazard 
ratio, 10.6; 95% CI, 7.7–14.8) and nonrevascularized 
(hazard ratio, 6.1; 95% CI, 4.1–9.2; Table 2) patients.
inpatient Versus Outpatient eF reassessment
Among patients with an EF reassessment within 1 year, 
69% of EF reassessments were performed in the outpa-
tient setting for revascularized patients, and 49% of EF 
reassessments were done as outpatients for nonrevas-
cularized patients. Relative to no EF reassessment, both 
inpatient and outpatient EF reassessments were associ-
ated with increased cumulative incidence and unadjusted 
likelihood of ICD implantation within 1 year after MI re-
gardless of revascularization status (Table 3). After mul-
tivariable adjustment, outpatient EF reassessment was 
associated with a 12-fold increase in likelihood of ICD 
implantation within 1 year for revascularized patients, 
whereas inpatient EF reassessment was associated with 
an 8-fold increase in ICD implantation (P=0.01; Table 3). 
Similarly, outpatient EF reassessment trended toward a 
stronger association with ICD implantation among nonre-
vascularized patients, although the interaction term did 
not meet statistical significance.
DiscUssiOn
Among post-MI patients with an initially reduced EF 
(≤35%), EF reassessments were performed in 66.8% of 
patients within 1 year after discharge. Patients who were 
revascularized at the time of MI were more likely to have 
an EF reassessment than nonrevascularized patients. 
There was marginal to no variability in downstream EF 
reassessment rates between discharging hospitals. Al-
though EF reassessment was associated with higher 
adjusted likelihood of ICD implantation, 1-year ICD im-
plantation rates were low even among patients whose 
EF was reassessed. Post-MI outpatient EF reassessment 
was more strongly associated with ICD implantation with-
in 1 year of MI than inpatient EF reassessment.
Primary prevention ICDs are underused among pa-
tients with ischemic cardiomyopathy24 and among pa-
tients with low EF after acute MI.17 Because prior studies 
have not demonstrated benefit with early ICD implanta-
tion after MI,4,5 guidelines recommend a waiting period 
of at least 40 days to assess ICD candidacy for patients 
with MI with evidence of severe left ventricular systolic 
dysfunction.12,13 The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid 
Services reimburse primary prevention ICD implanta-
tions only when performed >90 days after revasculariza-
tion. This mandated waiting period may contribute to the 
low rates of ICD use in eligible post-MI patients.18,19
The use of revascularization and antiremodeling 
medication therapies after MI, along with recovery from 
stunning, can change a patient’s candidacy for ICD 
therapy.6–11 Thus, EF reassessment is an important step 
before primary prevention ICD implantation. A previous 
study of 533 patients with left ventricular dysfunction af-
ter MI demonstrated that only 35% of patients reported 
EF reassessment over the next 6 months.16 Our study 
examined a larger, nationally representative sample of 
older patients with left ventricular dysfunction after MI 
and used administrative claims to more objectively as-
certain EF reassessment rates. We observed a higher 
rate (67%) of EF reassessment; revascularized patients 
with MI were more likely to have their EF reassessed than 
nonrevascularized patients (77% versus 54%; P<0.001). 
Despite the longer time window recommended before 
the consideration of a primary prevention ICD for revas-
cularized versus nonrevascularized patients, the timing 
of EF reassessment was earlier for revascularized than 
nonrevascularized patients. These findings may under-
score greater provider expectation of EF recovery, par-
ticularly among revascularized patients who are younger 
and have fewer comorbidities.
A prior examination of this study population had shown 
very low ICD implantation rates among eligible patients 
with severe left ventricular dysfunction after MI.17 The ICD 
implantation rates remained relatively unchanged even in 
patient subpopulations with the lowest likelihood of EF 
recovery (largest infarct size as determined by troponin 
level and lowest EF) and the lowest comorbidity scores 
by Charlson comorbidity index.17,25 We had hypothesized 
that EF measurement drives ICD candidacy and there-

fore that EF reassessment would be associated with 
higher likelihood of ICD implantation. Our data confirmed 
this hypothesis: EF reassessment was associated with 
a higher likelihood of ICD implantation within 1 year of 
MI. However, rates of ICD implantation were low despite 
two thirds of patients having an EF reassessment; only 
11% of patients with EF reassessment underwent ICD 
implantation within 1 year.
We considered several explanations for these find-
ings. First, this is an older patient population than was 
studied in the clinical trials of primary prevention ICDs.1,2 
We previously showed that increasing age in this Medi-
care population was associated with lower ICD implanta-
tion rates (hazard ratio, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.69–0.78 per 
5-year increase in age), despite the fact that the asso-
ciation between ICD implantation and lower mortality 
was similar among patients ≥80 years and patients <80 
years of age (P=0.44 for interaction).17 Patients without 
an EF reassessment tended to be older, with nearly 75% 
of the patients with EF reassessment being <80 years 
of age. If the assumption is that EF reassessment is per-
formed to assess ICD candidacy, it may be that many of 
the patients without an EF reassessment (33%) were not 
considered candidates for an ICD.
Second, EF reassessment was determined from 
Medicare claims data, and the numeric value of the re-
peat EF was not available in this data set. Thus, the 
proportion of patients with persistently low EF meeting 
criteria for a primary prevention ICD is unknown, but 
it is unlikely that EF recovery on repeat assessment 
fully explains the very low rates of ICD use observed 
in our study.17,26,27 In addition, revascularized patients 
have greater potential for EF recovery than nonrevas-
cularized patients, but the rate of ICD implantation was 
actually higher among revascularized (12%) than nonre-
vascularized (10%) patients among those with EF reas-
sessments performed.
Third, if providers are not performing EF reassess-
ment for the purpose of screening ICD candidacy, then 
EF reassessment may not necessarily influence ICD im-
plantation rates. The motivation for EF reassessment is 
not captured in claims data. Rehospitalizations are com-
mon among post-MI patients >65 years of age.28,29 In 
our study, more than a third of EF reassessments were 
performed in the inpatient setting. On the basis of the 
assumption that outpatient EF reassessments may more 
likely be ordered with a focus on assessing ICD candi-
dacy, in contrast to inpatient EF reassessments, which 
may be performed for other reasons related more to 
the acute hospitalization, we conducted a sensitivity 
analysis evaluating the strength of the association be-
tween inpatient versus outpatient EF reassessment and 
ICD use within 1 year of MI. We observed a stronger 
association between ICD implantation and outpatient EF 
reassessment compared with inpatient EF reassessment 
among revascularized patients; a similar but nonsignifi-
cant trend was seen among nonrevascularized patients. 
This finding may be due to the fact that outpatient EF 
reassessments were more frequently ordered for the 
purpose of ICD consideration or because the outpatient 
EF data were more readily available to the providers re-
sponsible for primary prevention ICD decision making. If 
the latter is the case, interventions to remove commu-
nication barriers between inpatient and outpatient care

settings may help bridge the care transition gap to opti-
mize ICD use rates.
Finally, even among patients for whom an outpatient 
EF reassessment was performed, only 11% of patients 
underwent ICD implantation within the 1 year after MI 
regardless of revascularization status. These results im-
ply that simply increasing provider ordering of diagnos-
tic imaging for EF reassessment would not substantially 
improve ICD use rates among eligible patients. Patients 
may have been offered an ICD but declined. Our previ-
ous study showed that patients with more frequent post-
discharge interactions with cardiologists have a higher 
likelihood of ICD implantation within 1 year after MI.17 We 
believe that interventions to educate patients more ef-
fectively about the risks and benefits of ICD therapy and 
to facilitate shared decision making will likely move the 
needle on optimizing ICD consideration and use. The de-
cision to implant an ICD in patients with a low EF needs 
to be individualized on the basis of patient comorbidities, 
life expectancy, and patient wishes.
clinical context and Future studies
There are no clear guidelines on the optimal timing of EF 
reassessment after MI. The appropriate use criteria for 
ICD implantation determined that a primary prevention 
ICD is rarely appropriate within 40 days of an MI unless 
the patient has asymptomatic nonsustained ventricular 
tachycardia and a positive electrophysiology study or 
the patient has a pacemaker indication.30 Therefore, ICD 
implantation would not be a reason to reassess the EF 
within 40 days of MI unless the patient develops a pace-
maker indication. Patients without New York Heart As-
sociation class IV ischemic cardiomyopathy with an EF 
≤35% are appropriate for an ICD 40 days after MI if there 
has been no revascularization within the last 3 months 
or if the patient had a low EF before revascularization.30 
On the basis of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid 
Services coverage and the appropriateness criteria, it 
is reasonable to reassess the EF 40 days after MI in 
nonrevascularized patients and 90 days after revascular-
ization in revascularized patients. Findings in this post-MI 
Medicare population support early cardiology follow-up 
for all patients with MI. From these studies, we recom-
mend that all patients who are potential candidates for 
ICD therapy be routinely scheduled for follow-up outpa-
tient EF assessment before hospital discharge to bridge 
the currently observed gaps in care.17
Multiple future steps are needed to address the find-
ings in this study. First, these findings should be validat-
ed in a younger patient population. Second, studies with 
detailed patient-level data are needed to assess the rate 
of EF recovery in this post-MI patient population and how 
this influences ICD implantation rates. Third, studies with 
detailed patient, provider, and system data should be 
completed to improve the understanding of the relative 
contribution of each of these factors to the low rates of 
EF assessment and subsequent ICD implantation. Finally, 
an implementation and education program is needed to 
educate patients and providers on ICD candidacy and 
the use of the electronic health record to track patients 
with a low EF and to facilitate shared decision making 
to deliver appropriate care that is in line with patients’ 
preferences.
limitations
Although this analysis represents the largest study of 
post-MI EF reassessment, several limitations need to be 
acknowledged. In the observational setting, we cannot 
infer a causal relationship between EF reassessment 
and ICD implantation because unmeasured confound-
ing remains despite risk adjustment. Single imputation 
was used for missing variables instead of the preferred 
approach of multiple imputation because the results 
were not expected to differ given the small amount of 
missing data. Although all patients had an EF ≤35% at 
the time of MI and 83% of patients who received an ICD 
during the study follow-up period had an EF reassess-
ment before ICD implantation, no data are available on 
the actual EF measurement or other clinical features 
such as New York Heart Association class and optimal 
medical therapy use. We were unable to quantify the 
extent of EF recovery in this patient population. We also 
do not know the proportion of patients who were of-
fered and declined EF reassessment or ICD therapy. 
Patients may have undergone ICD implantation >1 year 
after their index MI, which was not captured in this 
study; however, the 1-year time period was used to at-
tempt to associate the index MI event to the ICD implan-
tation because ICD implantation >1 year after the index 
MI may have more likely been related to a subsequent 
cardiovascular event. Whether EF reassessments were 
performed specifically to screen for ICD candidacy is 
also unknown. Last, we were not able to evaluate the 
appropriateness of the ICDs that were implanted. Our 
study population was significantly older (median age, 
78 years) than the study populations in the MADIT II 
(Multicenter Automatic Defibrillator Implantation Trial II; 
median age, 64 years)1 and SCD-HeFT (Sudden Cardiac 
Death in Heart Failure Trial; median age, 60 years).2 
However, pooled clinical trial and observational data 
have suggested that even patients ≥75 years of age 
have survival benefit from ICDs.17,31
conclusions
In US clinical practice, EF reassessments were common-
ly performed within 1 year after discharge among pa-
tients with MI with an initial EF ≤35%. Patients who were 
revascularized at the time of MI were more likely to have 
an EF reassessment than nonrevascularized patients.

For older patients with MI, although EF reassessment 
was associated with greater likelihood of ICD implanta-
tion after risk adjustment, overall 1-year ICD implanta-
tion rates were only 12% for revascularized and 10% of 
nonrevascularized patients who had EF reassessments 
performed. These results imply that simply increasing 
provider ordering of diagnostic imaging for EF reas-
sessment would not substantially improve ICD use rates 
among eligible patients.
