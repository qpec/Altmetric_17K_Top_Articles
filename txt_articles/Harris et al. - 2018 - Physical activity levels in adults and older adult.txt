Abstract
Background
Physical inactivity is an important cause of noncommunicable diseases. Interventions can
increase short-term physical activity (PA), but health benefits require maintenance. Few
interventions have evaluated PA objectively beyond 12 months. We followed up two pedom-
eter interventions with positive 12-month effects to examine objective PA levels at 3–4
years.
Methods and findings
Long-term follow-up of two completed trials: Pedometer And Consultation Evaluation-UP
(PACE-UP) 3-arm (postal, nurse support, control) at 3 years and Pedometer Accelerometer
Consultation Evaluation-Lift (PACE-Lift) 2-arm (nurse support, control) at 4 years post-
baseline. Randomly selected patients from 10 United Kingdom primary care practices were
recruited (PACE-UP: 45–75 years, PACE-Lift: 60–75 years). Intervention arms received
12-week walking programmes (pedometer, handbooks, PA diaries) postally (PACE-UP) or
with nurse support (PACE-UP, PACE-Lift). Main outcomes were changes in 7-day acceler-
ometer average daily step counts and weekly time in moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) in
�10-minute bouts in intervention versus control groups, between baseline and 3 years
(PACE-UP) and 4 years (PACE-Lift). PACE-UP 3-year follow-up was 67% (681/1,023)
(mean age: 59, 64% female), and PACE-Lift 4-year follow-up was 76% (225/298) (mean
age: 67, 53% female). PACE-UP 3-year intervention versus control comparisons were as

control comparisons were: +407 (95% CI: −177–992), p = 0.17 steps/day, and +32 (95% CI:
5–60), p = 0.02 minutes/week MVPA in bouts. Neither trial showed sedentary or wear-time
differences. Main study limitation was incomplete follow-up; however, results were robust to
missing data sensitivity analyses.
Conclusions
Intervention participants followed up from both trials demonstrated higher levels of objec-
tively measured PA at 3–4 years than controls, similar to previously reported 12-month trial
effects. Pedometer interventions, delivered by post or with nurse support, can help address
the public health physical inactivity challenge.

Author summary
Why was this study done?
• Brisk walking for 30 minutes or more daily on most days of the week can help adults
and older adults to achieve moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) guidelines
for health benefits, yet many do not achieve these levels.
• Previous pedometer-based walking studies have shown positive effects on increased step
counts and time in MVPA for up to 12 months.
• For sustained health benefits, increased physical activity levels need to be maintained,
yet there is a lack of data from interventions assessed using objectively measured physi-
cal activity levels beyond 12 months.
What did the researchers do and find?
• We followed up participants from two primary care 12-week pedometer-based walking
trials, including both nurse-supported and postal pedometer arms, to establish whether
objectively measured physical activity increases seen at 12 months were sustained at 3–4
years.
• PACE-UP followed up 45–75-year-olds 3 years post-baseline and showed that both
nurse-supported and postal pedometer interventions continued to have higher physical
activity levels compared to the control group (approximately an extra 28 and 24 min-
utes/week, respectively, of MVPA in bouts and an extra 670 and 630 steps/day,
respectively).

 • PACE-Lift results were very similar. In 60–75-year-olds followed up at 4 years post-
baseline, the nurse-supported pedometer intervention group spent about 33 minutes/
week more time in MVPA in bouts compared to the control group.
What do these findings mean?
• These findings suggest that adult and older adult participants receiving 12-week pedom-
eter-based walking interventions, provided either by post or with nurse support, are still
doing more physical activity 3–4 years later.
• Pedometer interventions can help address the public health physical inactivity
challenge.
Introduction
Strong evidence exists for the health benefits of physical activity (PA) for a wide range of con-
ditions [1,2]. Physical inactivity leads to high health service costs [1,3] and is the fourth leading
risk factor for global mortality [2]. Adult and older adult guidelines advise �150 minutes of
moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) weekly, or 75 minutes of vigorous PA, or a combination,
in �10-minute bouts [1,4], but any increase in PA for inactive people is valuable [5]. Many PA
interventions, including pedometer-based interventions, increase PA levels in the short term
[6–8]. However, long-term health effects require sustained PA changes [1], and evidence for
maintenance is lacking. A meta-analysis of PA interventions (including pedometers) in 55–
70-year-olds [8] only identified 2 trials with objective PA data beyond 12 months [9,10]. One
showed a significant step-count effect 18 months post-baseline, but only 6 months post-inter-
vention [10]; the other showed a significant increase in step count in the lifestyle group 23
months post-baseline, but only 12 months post-intervention [9]. The meta-analysis authors
[8] repeated requests made by previous systematic reviews [11,12] and guidelines [13] for trials
to be conducted with longer follow-up periods and objective PA measures.
We previously conducted two pedometer-based walking interventions with adults and
older adults, which increased step count and MVPA in bouts at 12 months and provided lon-
ger-term follow-up opportunities [14,15]. Both trials recruited postally from primary care and
delivered 12-week pedometer-based walking interventions incorporating behaviour change
techniques (BCTs) through dedicated practice nurse PA consultations (3 in PACE-UP, 4 in
PACE-Lift) or by post (PACE-UP only). PACE-Lift nurse consultations additionally provided
feedback on accelerometry findings to participants. PACE-UP recruited 1,023 predominantly
inactive 45–75-year-olds. Average baseline daily step count was 7,479 (standard deviation
[SD]: 2,671) and average time in MVPA in bouts was 94 (SD: 102) minutes/week. PACE-Lift
recruited 298 patients aged 60–75 years. Average baseline daily step count was 7,347 (SD:
2,839) and average time in MVPA in bouts was 92 (SD: 108) minutes/week. Despite age-group
and intervention differences, both trials and all intervention groups showed increases in step
counts of approximately one-tenth and time in MVPA of over one-third between baseline and
12 months [14,15].
The study aim was to follow up both trial cohorts to examine objectively measured PA levels
at 3 years in PACE-UP and 4 years in PACE-Lift. Given the different but overlapping age

 ranges, interventions that were similar but differed in intensity, and different lengths of fol-
low-up, we analysed the two trials separately, using identical methods, and present the results
in parallel.
Methods
Study design and participants
PACE-UP 3-year follow-up.
For the PACE-UP trial 3-year follow-up, London, Hamp-
stead, Research Ethics Committee (UK) granted approval (12L/LO/0219). Written informed
consent was gained from all research participants. Trial methods are published [16]; the postal
and nurse interventions are summarised in Table 1 and baseline findings are summarised in
S1 Table. The handbook and diary are available at www.paceup.sgul.ac.uk/materials. After a
12-month follow-up, 212/322 (66%) of controls were posted a pedometer, handbook, and PA
diary and 64/322 (20%) opted for a single nurse appointment, during which they also received
these materials. No further follow-up was offered at that point (compared with the trial postal-
intervention group, who were telephoned to check that materials had arrived and encouraged
to return completed PA diaries). Three-year follow-up collected accelerometry and patient-
reported outcome measures (PROMs) by post. To minimise seasonal effects on PA levels, base-
line, 12-month, and 3-year outcomes were assessed in the same month. Follow-up ran from
October 2015 to November 2016. The protocol, including 3-year follow-up details, is included
(S1 Protocol).
PACE-Lift 4-year follow-up.
For the PACE-Lift trial 4-year follow-up, Oxfordshire Re-
search Ethics Committee C (UK) granted approval (11/H0606/2). Written informed consent
was gained from all research participants. Trial methods are published [19]; the intervention is
summarised in Table 1 and baseline findings are summarised in S1 Table. After 12-month fol-
low-up, all control group participants were sent a pedometer and instructions; no support was
offered. Four-year follow-up collected the accelerometry and PROMs by post, as in PACE-UP.
Additionally, for PACE-Lift, the opportunity to meet study participants face to face after postal
return of accelerometers and questionnaires was offered to measure anthropometric variables.
For consistency with PACE-UP (in which face-to-face contact was not offered), only postal
outcomes (accelerometry and PROMs) are reported in this paper. Baseline, 12-month, and
4-year outcomes were assessed in the same month. Follow-up ran from October 2015 to Octo-
ber 2016. The protocol, including 4-year follow-up, is included (S2 Protocol).
Procedures
Participants who had not withdrawn from either trial by 12 months were eligible. Practices
excluded participants who had died, moved away, or developed a terminal illness or dementia.
Eligible participants were sent a trial follow-up letter, participant information sheet, consent
form, and freepost return envelope. Researchers telephoned participants to discuss any que-
ries. Those interested returned signed consent forms. Participants and researchers were
unmasked to intervention allocation.
Instruments, questionnaire measures, and protocols were the same as during the trial. Par-
ticipants were not asked to increase their PA levels, just to continue usual activity, and thus
health limitations did not preclude participation. Participants were instructed to wear the
accelerometer (Actigraph GT3X+) on a belt over one hip for 7 consecutive days, from getting
up until going to bed. A diary (to record activities) questionnaire and freepost envelope were
provided. If accelerometry recording did not result in �5 days with �540 minutes/day, partici-
pants were asked to re-wear monitors (re-wears were required for 20 PACE-UP and 1 PACE--
Lift participants). Participants were posted a £10 gift voucher.

 The Actigraph GT3X+ measures vertical accelerations in magnitudes from 0.05 to 2.0 g,
sampled at 30 Hz, and then summed over a 5-second epoch time period. It can record PA con-
tinuously for up to 21 days. Actigraph data were reduced using Actilife software (V6.6.0),
ignoring runs of �60 minutes of 0 counts [14,15]. Summary variables were as used in the trials
[14,15]: step counts, accelerometer wear time, time spent in total MVPA (�1,952 counts per
minute, equivalent to �3 metabolic equivalents), time spent in �10-minute bouts of MVPA,
and time spent sedentary (�100 counts per minute, equivalent to �1.5 metabolic equivalents).

 Only days with �540 minutes of registered time were used. To lessen attrition bias, main anal-
yses of effect included all subjects with �1 satisfactory day of recording at 3 (or 4) years.
Outcomes
Outcomes focussed on changes between baseline measures and follow-up measures at 3 years
(PACE-UP) or 4 years (PACE-Lift). For accelerometry, we analysed: (i) change in average
daily step count, (ii) change in time spent weekly in MVPA in �10-minute bouts, and (iii)
change in weekly sedentary time.
Questionnaire PROMs were as for 3- and 12-month outcomes [16,19]: quality of life [20],
exercise self-efficacy [21], pain [22], depression [23, 24], and anxiety [23, 25].
Statistical analysis
Analysis and reporting followed CONSORT guidelines (S1 Protocol, S2 Protocol). Primary
analyses were conducted using STATA version 14.0 (StataCorp), with a two-step process to
estimate change. In step 1, average daily step counts at 3 years (PACE-UP) or 4 years (PACE--
Lift) were computed from a random-effects model, allowing for day of the week and day of
wearing the accelerometer as fixed effects and participant as a random effect. In step 2, average
daily step count at 3 years (PACE-UP) or 4 years (PACE-Lift) was regressed on estimated base-
line average daily step count, with treatment group, age, gender, practice, and month of base-
line accelerometry as fixed effects and household as a random effect in a multilevel model.
Identical analyses were carried out for MVPA in �10-minute bouts, sedentary time, and wear
time. Changes in PROMs were estimated using step 2 only.
Primary analyses used 681 (PACE-UP) or 225 (PACE-Lift) participants who provided
accelerometry data at 3 or 4 years, respectively. Sensitivity analyses assessed the effect of miss-
ingness: (1) multiple imputation methods were used to impute outcome data for those missing
at 3 or 4 years, assuming outcomes were missing at random (MAR), conditional on model var-
iables, and using the STATA procedure mi impute, and (2) missing not at random (MNAR)
analyses. The purpose of the MNAR analyses was to assess how extreme the missing data
needed to be in order to explain away our positive effect estimates. To do this, we used the
Stata module rctmiss (Statistical Software Components [SSC] https://ideas.repec.org/s/boc/
bocode.html) [26]. Essentially, the rctmiss programme takes as its starting point MAR esti-
mates for all subjects with missing data. It then adds or subtracts steps to the estimates before
re-estimating the treatment effects. Thus, we left the control group missing values at their
MAR estimates and first subtracted 500 steps/day from the MAR estimates in the treatment
groups; we then took a more extreme scenario, in which we subtracted 1,000 steps/day for
those in the treatment groups, again leaving the control group missing values at their MAR
values.
Results
Of 1,023 PACE-UP participants, 32 withdrew by 12 months, 2 died before the 3-year follow-
up, 1 was excluded, and 681 provided �1 day of adequate accelerometry data. The 3-year fol-
low-up rate was 69% (681/988), or 67% (681/1,023) of initial trial participants, the mean age
was 59 (SD = 7.9), and 64% (438/681) were female. Of 298 PACE-Lift participants, 15 with-
drew by 12 months, 2 died before the 4-year follow-up, and 225 provided �1 day of adequate
accelerometry data. The 4-year follow-up rate was 80% (225/281), or 76% (225/298) of original
trial participants, the mean age was 67 (SD = 4.2), and 53% (120/225) were female. The CON-
SORT diagram (Fig 1) shows 3- and 4-year follow-up data by randomised groups. Ninety-two

 percent (625/681) in PACE-UP and 93% (209/225) in PACE-Lift provided �5 days of accel-
erometry data at 3 and 4 years, respectively (S2 Table and S3 Table).
Accelerometry summary measures are shown for the three PACE-UP groups (S2 Table)
and two PACE-Lift groups (S3 Table) at each time point. Fig 2 displays effect estimates for dif-
ferent groups from both trials at all time periods for step counts and time in MVPA in bouts,
respectively. Table 2 shows these estimates plus sedentary time and wear time in tabular form.
At 3 years in PACE-UP, both intervention groups are doing more steps/day than controls,
with no significant intervention group differences: postal +627 (95% CI: 198–1,056); nurse
+670 (95% CI: 237–1,102). For PACE-Lift, at 4 years, the intervention group is doing more
steps/day than the control group, although the difference is not statistically significant: +407
(95% CI: −177–992). For total weekly MVPA in �10-minute bouts (minutes/week), PACE-UP
3-year findings compared with control are as follows: postal +28 (95% CI: 7–49); nurse +24
(95% CI: 3–45). For PACE-Lift at 4 years, the intervention group is still doing significantly
more MVPA in bouts (minutes/week) than the control group: +32 (95% CI: 5–60). Effect esti-
mates for both steps per day and MVPA were stable when we limited analyses to subjects with
at least 4 days of measurement at follow-up (S4 Table).

 In PACE-UP, the 3-year treatment effects for steps/day were 98% (postal) (627/642) and
99% (nurse) (670/677), respectively, of the 1-year estimates; in PACE-Lift, the 4-year estimate
was 67% (407/610) of the 1-year estimate. For minutes of MVPA in 10-minute bouts, PACE-
UP estimates were 85% (postal) (28/33) and 69% (nurse) (24/35), respectively, of the 1-year
estimates, while the PACE-Lift estimate was 82% (32/39). Neither PACE-UP nor PACE-Lift
showed differences between intervention and control groups at 3 and 4 years for sedentary
time or daily wear time (Table 2). A PACE-UP subgroup analysis demonstrated similar effects
for steps/day in 45–59- and 60–75-year-olds (S1 Fig).
None of the interventions had significant effects on pain, depression, anxiety, or health-
related quality of life at 3 or 4 years, consistent with 3- and 12-month findings (S4 Table). In
PACE-UP, there was a persistent exercise self-efficacy effect for the nurse group at 3 years
(also seen at 3 and 12 months) but not in PACE-Lift at 4 years (S5 Table).
Table 3 presents sensitivity analyses assuming that missing outcome data were MAR, condi-
tional on a variety of predictors; analyses had little impact on the primary outcome step-count
effect estimates and do not change interpretation. For the MNAR analyses, we combined both
intervention groups in PACE-UP to increase power and simplify presentation; separate analy-
ses give a similar picture. The MNAR analyses (S2 Fig) make a bigger impact for both trials but

 only when we assume there is a strong differential departure between the non-random effects
in control and treatment groups (see solid lines in S2 Fig). For example, when we assume that
the missing data in the treatment groups are 1,000 steps below their MAR values while the con-
trol group values are at their MAR values, the treatment effects for PACE-UP are no longer sta-
tistically significant; but even then, the confidence interval is still largely positive.
Discussion
To our knowledge, these are the first population-based pedometer studies showing effects on
objectively measured PA levels more than 12 months post-intervention. Compared to controls,
intervention participants followed up from both PACE-UP and PACE-Lift trials showed signifi-
cant increases in MVPA in bouts at 3 and 4 years of approximately an extra 30 minutes weekly,
with no difference between intervention groups in PACE-UP (as was also found at 12 months).
PACE-UP showed a significant step-count increase of approximately 650 steps/day; PACE-Lift
showed a similar but nonsignificant step-count increase. The increases seen in PA levels were
similar to those seen at 12 months. No differences were seen in sedentary or wear time.
This work’s main strength is its documentation of longer-term follow-up results beyond 12
months from trials with objective PA data relevant to guidelines. Both trials were based on
population-based primary care samples and achieved good follow-up. Sensitivity analyses
demonstrated that effect estimates were robust; only extreme assumptions changed interpreta-
tion. We presented findings for two trials with overlapping but different age groups and
slightly different intervention intensities and follow-up periods. However, the many similari-
ties (recruited postally from primary care; 12-week pedometer-based interventions, including
nurse-support arms; accelerometer-assessed main PA outcome measures beyond 12 months)

 meant there was considerable value in presenting the results together. Age was not an effect
modifier in PACE-UP. Despite their differences, both trials show similar consistent long-term
increased time in MVPA in bouts for intervention group participants.
The study also had a number of potential limitations. Long-term follow-up data were pro-
vided by 76% of PACE-Lift and 67% of PACE-UP original trial participants. Whilst only a
small proportion of participants actively withdrew from each trial, reasons for withdrawal
were not systematically collected. Whilst losing between a quarter and a third of subjects at fol-
low-up could reduce the generalizability of the findings, we have directly addressed the risk of
attrition bias through sensitivity analyses using appropriate imputation methods, and this gave
robust results. Participants and researchers were unmasked to group; however, PA outcomes
were assessed objectively by accelerometry, and participants were blind to measurements. Par-
ticipants might have tried harder with PA when monitored, but this would also have affected
controls and would have been reduced by using a 7-day data collection protocol [6]. Also, the
intervention groups increased their MVPA in �10-minute bouts, implying that participants
made changes as advised. Whilst the Actigraph accelerometer provides valid estimates of time
spent in different intensity levels, including MVPA [27], any waist-mounted activity monitor
may underestimate upper body movement, such as weight training and carrying heavy loads
[28]; it also underestimates cycling and did not measure swimming. However, crucially, accel-
erometers are most sensitive to ambulatory activities such as walking, which was the main
intervention component of both trials. A further potential limitation is that minimal interven-
tions were offered to both trial control groups after 12-month follow-up. However, this con-
tamination would tend to weaken intervention effects, so the existence of differences in PA
levels at 3 and 4 years is an important positive finding and helps us to understand the addi-
tional support required for a successful postal intervention.
This paper provides novel, important evidence on sustained effects of pedometer-based
walking interventions on objectively measured PA levels. A recent systematic review of the
effectiveness of behavioural interventions in increasing PA at 12–36 months [8] identified two
studies that provided objectively measured outcomes beyond 12 months [9,10]. We identified
two more recent studies using a similar search strategy [29,30]. In reviewing these studies,
several issues emerge. First, interventions differed dramatically in duration, intensity, and
resources needed—particularly important when considering cost-effectiveness. Second, stud-
ies reported follow-up length post-baseline, not post-intervention; maintenance of effects is
defined by the latter. None of the four studies provided outcomes more than 12 months post-
intervention: one was 6 months post-intervention [10], two were ongoing at the point of
assessment [29, 30], and the final one was 12 months post-intervention [9]. Our two studies
thus provide the first clear evidence of efficacy for pedometer-based interventions at 33
months and 45 months post-intervention, providing the type of evidence from PA interven-
tions recently called for [8,11,13]. The simplicity of our postal intervention makes it likely to
be more cost-effective than more intensive interventions, and the PACE-UP trial cost-effec-
tiveness analyses at 12-month follow-up demonstrated this [14,31].
Our findings support guidance to promote pedometers alongside support for goal setting,
self-monitoring, and feedback [32]. However, it is important to consider which factors in
pedometer-based interventions are important for success. Both PACE-UP and PACE-Lift
included a pedometer, step-count diary, and patient handbook, including BCTs and practice
nurse PA consultations [16,19]. Despite PACE-Lift providing a more intensive nurse interven-
tion than PACE-UP, both trials delivered similar effects on PA outcomes at 12 months [14,15]
and at 3 or 4 years. Additionally, nurse and postal interventions in PACE-UP achieved similar
outcomes at 12 months [14] and 3 years. These findings confirm that shorter, simpler inter-
ventions can be equally effective [8,33]. Systematic reviews suggest that individual tailoring,

 personalised activity goals, and using a step-count diary are important [6,8]; all interventions
from both trials provided these elements. That the minimal postal interventions given to both
trial control groups at 12 months were not effective at increasing PA levels suggests that the
additional support given to the original PACE-UP trial postal arm (follow-up telephone call
after a week and encouragement to return completed PA diary after 3 months) was important
for this group’s success. The original postal group also had step-count targets set based on
baseline blinded pedometer use and received the intervention when they had just been re-
cruited to the trial, so they may have been more motivated. These factors may also have been
important to the trial postal intervention’s success. PA guidelines stress the importance of
increasing time in MVPA [1,4] rather than just steps. Both of our interventions addressed this:
PACE-Lift by nurse feedback on PA intensity from accelerometers [19] and PACE-UP by the
“3,000-steps-in 30-minutes” [34] advice given to nurse-support and postal arms [16]. Both tri-
als were effective at increasing MVPA in bouts for all intervention groups at all outcome
assessments: 3 and 12 months [14,15] and now at 3 years (PACE-UP) and 4 years (PACE-Lift).
We took the effect estimates from the simplest intervention (PACE-UP postal) to estimate
long-term health benefits. Based on a systematic review that quantified the strength of associa-
tion between walking and coronary heart disease [35], a 28 minutes per week increase in
MVPA in bouts seen in the postal group at 3 years should reduce coronary heart disease risk
by approximately 4% (95% CI: 3–5%) (see S1 Text). A cohort study that related pedometer
steps to mortality [36] allowed us to estimate that a sustained increase of 627 steps/day in the
postal group at 3 years should lead to a decrease in all-cause mortality of approximately 4%
(95% CI: 1–5%) (see S1 Text).
Whilst environmental and policy interventions are urgently required to address the global
inactivity challenge [37], individual PA behaviour change interventions are also important.
The sustained effects seen on objective PA outcomes at 3 years for the lower cost postal inter-
vention suggest that this would be an effective and cost-effective [31] intervention to roll out.
Minimal support is also required to check that materials have arrived and to encourage return
of completed PA diaries but need not be face to face or delivered by a healthcare professional.
We are currently conducting implementation work (PACE-UP Next Steps) exploring reach,
retention, and ease of adoption in primary care recruiting via postal and face-to-face routes.
The use of wearables to monitor personal PA levels has dramatically increased, through
smartphones, wrist- or body-worn devices, and mobile apps, offering opportunities for
increasing PA. The “3,000-steps-in-30-minutes” message captures intensity and could become
an important new public health goal [34], with new, easy ways to measure steps. Small short-
term studies in adults and older adults demonstrate that mobile PA apps can increase PA self-
monitoring [38,39] and engagement in regular PA [38,39] and that body-worn fitness trackers
can increase time spent in MVPA [39]. PACE-UP Next Steps is currently testing online
resources and a mobile app to support the PACE-UP postal intervention. However, despite
new PA monitoring opportunities, it is important not to ignore robust, trial-based evidence on
effective and cost-effective pedometer- plus paper-based interventions.
Conclusion
We previously reported increased PA at 12 months following 12-week pedometer-based walk-
ing interventions for adults and older adults recruited through primary care, delivered either
by post with minimal support or through nurse-supported PA consultations. The current
paper demonstrates that these findings are still present in participants followed up at 3–4
years. The long-term success of these interventions suggests that they could help to address the
public health physical inactivity challenge.
