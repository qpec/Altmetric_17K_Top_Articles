Abstract: Long-term antidepressant treatment has increased and there is evidence of adverse 
effects; however, little is known about patients’ experiences and views of this form of treat-
ment. This study used mixed methods to examine patients’ views and experiences of long-term 
antidepressant treatment, including benefits and concerns. Data from 180 patients, who were 
long-term users of antidepressants (3–15 years), were extracted from an anonymous online 
survey of patients’ experiences of antidepressants in New Zealand. Participants had completed 
rating scales about the effectiveness of antidepressants, levels of depression before and during 
antidepressant use, quality of life, and perceived adverse effects. Two open-ended questions 
allowed participants to comment on personal experiences. The majority (89.4%) reported that 
antidepressants had improved their depression although 30% reported moderate-to-severe 
depression on antidepressants. Common adverse effects included withdrawal effects (73.5%), 
sexual problems (71.8%), and weight gain (65.3%). Adverse emotional effects, such as feeling 
emotionally numb (64.5%) and addicted (43%), were also common. While the majority of 
patients were pleased with the benefits of antidepressant treatment, many were concerned about 
these adverse effects. Some expressed a need for more information about long-term risks and 
increased information and support to discontinue.
Keywords: antidepressants, patients’ experiences, patients’ beliefs, adverse effects, withdrawal 
symptoms, discontinuation syndrome
Introduction
Antidepressant treatment can be viewed as having both short- and long-term aspects 
with short-term treatment including the acute and continuation phase, and long-term 
treatment including the maintenance phase.1,2 Increases in long-term antidepressant treat-
ment of depression have contributed to the rise in antidepressant use.3,4 An examination 
of data from the United Kingdom General Practice database for the first antidepressant 
prescriptions between 1993 and 2005 found that the average number of prescriptions 
per patient doubled from 2.8 to 5.6 and a proportion of patients received, on average, 
35 prescriptions over a 5-year period.4 It has been argued that patients with histories 
of recurrent depressive episodes may require long-term or indefinite treatment with 
antidepressants.5,6 Changes in prescribing guidelines have also shifted toward longer 
term maintenance treatment. A recent international review of 13 sets of prescribing 
guidelines revealed that recommendations for duration of continuation treatment varied 
from 4 to 12 months and maintenance treatment from 1 year to lifelong or indefinite.7
While there is evidence for continuation of antidepressant treatment after remis-
sion, there is less evidence for maintenance or longer term treatment.8 While most 
cases of depression are managed through primary care,9 a recent review revealed 
that no randomized clinical trials have been conducted to evaluate the efficacy of

long-term treatment in primary care.10 However, a review of 
14 naturalistic studies of long-term treatment for depression 
over 10 years found that outcomes for depressed patients 
were poor, with multiple relapses and large variability, both 
within and between individuals.10 Patients in nondrug-treated 
samples did not show worse outcomes, while some had 
superior outcomes. Furthermore, a study of antidepressant 
use over 2 years in primary and secondary clinical care found 
high rates of recurrence (60%–63%) in patients continuously 
using adequate dosages of antidepressants.11 Patients not 
treated with antidepressants after remission had the lowest 
recurrence rate (26%).11
A recent investigation of patient-perceived side effects 
in the Netherlands found that 63% of patients reported, on 
average, 2.9% side effects during the 1–2 years of follow-up 
period.12 The researchers used a 12-item shortened version 
of the Antidepressant Side-Effect Checklist that included 
insomnia, sleepiness during the day, restlessness, muscle 
spasms/twitching, dry mouth, profuse sweating, sexual 
disorders, nausea, constipation, diarrhea, weight gain, and 
dizziness.12 The most frequently reported side effects for 
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) were dry 
mouth, profuse sweating, sexual dysfunction, and weight 
gain.12 Two recent reviews of research in this area concluded 
that discontinuation effects, sexual dysfunction, weight 
gain, and sleep disturbance (multiple long-wake periods) 
are adverse effects of long-term SSRI use.13,14 There is also 
increased risks of osteoporosis and fracture, bleeding disor-
ders, hyponatremia,13,14 and diabetes mellitus.15
It is also important to note that qualitative research has 
revealed a range of emotional adverse effects that are not 
investigated in the majority of studies, including the study 
mentioned earlier.12 A literature review of research into 
patients’ perspectives of antidepressants found that these 
included sedative-type effects, emotional blunting, and 
emotional instability.16 These adverse effects are often not 
investigated and are not mentioned, both on drug packaging 
and in advertising.17 Hence, adverse effects that impact 
emotional well-being are often ignored.
The data for this study came from a large online survey 
of patients’ experiences of antidepressants in New Zea-
land (N=1,829).18 This survey aimed to gain insight into 
patients’ perspectives of antidepressant medication. 
Approximately 50% of participants reported being on antide-
pressants for $3 years. Those who had used antidepressants 
for .3 years reported more severe side effects, including 
“weight gain”, “addiction”, “feeling not like myself ”, 
“withdrawal symptoms”, and “suicidality”, than those who 
had been on antidepressants for #2 years.18
Little is known about patients’ perspectives on long-term 
antidepressant use. To gain insight into patients’ experiences 
of the benefits and problems associated with this form of 
treatment, this study examines the experiences of patients 
who participated in the New Zealand survey and first began 
using antidepressants in the 1997–2001 period. It asks the 
following questions: What are the patient-perceived benefits 
of long-term antidepressant use? What are the patient-
perceived risks or concerns about long-term use?
Methods
instruments and procedure
Ethics approval was given for the original survey by the Uni-
versity of Auckland Human Subjects Ethics Committee (Ref: 
7340). The original anonymous online survey was advertised 
through the New Zealand media. Consent was indicated by 
participation in the anonymous survey. Criteria for participa-
tion included having used an antidepressant in the previous 
5 years and being 18 years of age or older. Participants 
completed rating scales, including levels of depression before 
and during antidepressant treatment, perceived effectiveness 
of antidepressants, perceived impact on the quality of life, 
and perceived adverse effects. The survey also contained 
open-ended questions. These included the following:
1. Could you please complete this sentence or paragraph: 
“In my life, antidepressants have been … .?”
2. If there is anything you would like to say about your 
experiences of antidepressants, please write about this 
in the box below.
Further information about the study methods is available 
from the original study.14
Researchers have used various criteria in the study of 
long-term antidepressant treatment, including 18 months,18 
2 years,11 and $10 years.12 The original survey provided a 
series of options in terms of the length of antidepressant 
use. The maximum available to participants was $3 years. 
To access a subgroup of participants who had used antide-
pressants for longer term, the criteria for participation in this 
study were having begun antidepressant treatment between 
1997 and 2001, having used antidepressants in the 5 years 
before completing the survey, and having used antidepres-
sants for a minimum of 3 years. Participants in the original 
(and current) study who reported using medications that were 
not antidepressants were excluded from the study.
Participants
The participants in the study were 180 adults (Table 1). Of 
these, 149 were prescribed antidepressants by their general 
practitioner and 31 by a psychiatrist. Some participants

Patient perspectives of long-term antidepressant use
noted in their written comments how many years they 
had been on antidepressants. The available data indicates 
that the participants in this study were on antidepressant 
medication for 3–15 years. The most commonly prescribed 
antidepressants were citalopram (23%), venlafaxine (18%), 
paroxetine (13%), 21 fluoxetine (13%), loxamine (7%), and 
nortriptyline (3%).
Data analysis
Descriptive statistics were calculated for the quantitative data 
from the rating scales using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, 
Version 20.0 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA).
Qualitative data from both open-ended questions were 
combined – all participants (N=180) answered the first ques-
tion, and 108 participants the second. A categorical analysis, 
based on the methods described by Bowling,19 was conducted 
on the qualitative data. All the data were read and reread 
to develop an understanding of the views and experiences 
expressed. Patterns were examined in the combined data set 
by the first, fourth, and fifth authors independently. Three 
main categories of response were identified by each of the 
authors. These included a category of positive statements 
about the benefits of antidepressants, a category of state-
ments about the problematic aspects, and a third category of 
statements regarding other concerns and preferences. These 
were further examined for subcategories. The data were then 
entered into SPSS 20 and the frequencies for each category 
and subcategory were calculated.
Results
levels of depression and quality of life
As can be seen from Table 2, the respondents reported an 
overall improvement in levels of depression and quality 
of life while on antidepressants, although 30.7% reported 
moderate-to-severe depression while on antidepressants.
Adverse effects
Ten adverse effects were reported by more than half of the 
participants (Table 3). The five most commonly selected 
adverse effects were withdrawal effects (73.5%), sexual dif-
ficulties (71.8%), weight gain (65.3%), feeling emotionally 
numb (64.5%), and failure to reach orgasm (64.5%). Between 
36% and 57% of respondents experienced these adverse 
effects at either a moderate or severe level. Participants 
also reported a number of other emotional effects, includ-
ing “feeling not like myself ” (54.4%), “reduced positive 
feelings” (45.6%), “caring less about others” (36.4%), and 
“suicidality” (36%).
Qualitative analysis
As outlined in the “Methods” section, three main categories 
of response were defined from the analysis of the combined 
qualitative data set. An overview is presented in Table 4.
They helped me to cope with life
Just over two-thirds of participants wrote that antidepres-
sants had helped them to get by or cope, and around one-fifth 
thought that they had functioned well as a result of being on 
an antidepressant.
As one participant said,
A necessary part of life that makes it easier to cope with the 
dramas that life gives me. Over the past few years I have 
experienced several major life events […] I do not think 
I would have coped with these events without the use of 
antidepressants. [P. 60].

One woman talked about her perception that the 
antidepressants helped her to have a “normal life”:
In my life antidepressants have been very useful. I am now 
a very functional human being and can lead an absolutely 
normal life with no problems whatsoever. [P. 7].
Problems with antidepressants
In this category, participants wrote mainly about a long pro-
cess of finding an antidepressant that “worked”, problems 
with discontinuation, the negative impact of antidepressants 
on views of self, and other adverse effects.
Some participants talked about the years it took to find 
an antidepressant that was effective for them.
It did, however, take many years of trying different types 
of antidepressants before I found one that seemed to work 
for me and had few side effects or side effects that were 
manageable. [P. 133].
As noted earlier, 74% of participants reported problems 
with withdrawal symptoms and 21% wrote about problems 
with withdrawal in the open-ended questions. Some com-
mented that they had not been informed about the difficulties 
of withdrawing from antidepressants after long-term use.
I was never informed by doctors of long-term side effects 
or addiction/development of tolerance and went through 
extremely severe withdrawal symptoms attempting to get 
off (suicidal level depression). Only by persisting through 
terrible suffering did I wean myself off. [P. 98].
Some felt unable to discontinue antidepressant treatment 
as a result. For the woman below, this resulted in a lack of 
options with regard to managing her depression.
While there is no doubt I am better on this medication, the 
adverse effects have been devastating – when I have tried 
to withdraw with “head zaps”, agitation, insomnia and 
mood changes. This means that I do not have the option of

Patient perspectives of long-term antidepressant use
managing the depression any other way because I have a 
problem coming off this medication. [P. 102].
Some talked about the ways in which taking antidepres-
sants impacted their views of themselves. This included 
feeling abnormal for needing an antidepressant and having 
difficulty knowing what is “actually me” as opposed to the 
effects of the antidepressant.
I have been on them for so long now that I’m not sure 
how much of myself is actually me and how much is the 
antidepressant. [P. 56].
One woman wrote about a number of these concerns, 
including the impact of long-term use on her brain.
Have now been taking SSRIs for better part of 15 years. 
Whenever I have tried to stop, I find I “relapse” or experience 
withdrawal symptoms. I worry that my brain chemistry has 
been permanently affected, so I now feel I cannot be “nor-
mal” without them […] I try to get off them but can’t seem 
to do it, no matter how slowly I wean myself off. [P. 80].
Other adverse effects written about by participants 
included increases in numbing or emotional bluntness, 
suicidality, weight gain, and sexual problems.
Something I have been told to take but I do not like them. They 
numb all your feelings, both positive and negative. [P. 55].
I have been permanently damaged sexually by the 
drugs. [P. 98].
I have tried numerous antidepressants with severe side 
effects […] when on some of them my mood has lowered 
to feeling suicidal. [P. 125].
Beyond antidepressants
Participants reflected on a number of concerns, including the 
importance of receiving therapy, the need for accurate and full 
information about long-term use, and the role of prescribers. 
Of these participants, 26% wrote about alternatives to anti-
depressants. Some commented that antidepressants are not 
the only alternative that can help with recovery.
Antidepressants are seen as a cure all and this forgets all 
the other things that help. [P. 56].
Antidepressants in combination with moderate amounts 
of exercise, flexible working hours, meditation/mindfulness 
and supportive relationships are key for me to maintain 
wellness in my life. [P. 133].
Thirty participants (17%) also wrote about the importance 
of therapy or counseling as part of their treatment. As the 
participants below said,
I believe the antidepressants helped, but I needed a 
counsellor to help me work through some of the causes […] 
I had been depressed on and off since teenage years. CBT 
has given me the skills to cope with life on a daily basis 
without drugs (most of the time). [P. 89].
I believe that I did have depression and that it was a 
result of a series of stressful experiences over a long duration. 
Affordable access to a psychologist would have negated the 
requirement for medication. What resolved my depression in 
the end was visiting a psychologist regularly over a couple of 
years […] this was very expensive, but worth it. [P. 65].
Some also expressed frustration that the therapy was 
not more easily available. As one prescriber who had used 
antidepressants said,
Unfortunately there is great difficulty and cost in getting 
alternative therapies (eg, good quality CBT). It is cheaper, 
easier and more convenient to reach for the prescription pad. 
I know this because I am a prescriber! [P. 111].
As well as writing about alternatives to antidepressants, 
some participants commented on valuing the general practi-
tioner’s role. Others commented on the lack of information 
that was provided on long-term effects, including withdrawal 
effects.
I was never fully informed of all side effects, short or long-
term. I have kept the information I receive when prescribed 
when is minimal/basic. […] I am now only this and last year 
finding out the permanent damage from medication that the 
prescriber knew about but didn’t tell me. If I had been more 
fully informed I would not have taken the medication for 
a long time or at all. [P. 122].
There is a lack of consumer-based information of personal 
experiences of antidepressants especially coming off and what 
is happening when an adverse relapse conditions kicks in; that 
is, how to withdraw safely. Also lack of info on long-term 
physical effects of staying on antidepressants. [P. 141].
Comments also addressed the perceived need for more 
support from prescribers with regard to discontinuation of 
antidepressants.
The difficulty of getting off has been a tough road and taken 
me years of trying and is something that doctors could be 
more knowledgeable of and supportive with. [P. 72].
Discussion
The majority of patients in this study believed that antide-
pressants alleviated their depression and improved their 
quality of life to some degree, although 30% reported

moderate-to-severe depression while using antidepressants. 
As reported in 2013, experiences of adverse effects were 
common.12 However, Bet et al’s study12 did not examine the 
adverse emotional effects reported in this study nor did it 
examine the patients’ reports of withdrawal symptoms.
Some patients in this study were particularly concerned 
about severe withdrawal symptoms that undermined their 
confidence to discontinue should they wish to and therefore 
limited their choices. In line with this, 45% patients also 
believed that they had some level of addiction to the antide-
pressant. Some patients were also critical of the lack of infor-
mation given by prescribers with regard to adverse effects, 
including withdrawal symptoms. Some also expressed disap-
pointment or frustration with the perceived lack of support 
available to them in managing withdrawal.
A previous study of patients’ beliefs regarding adher-
ence to antidepressant maintenance treatment (75 weeks) 
found that adherence was highest when the perceived need 
exceeded concerns about safety and lowest when concerns 
exceeded perceived need.20 In this study, some patients 
reported adhering to treatment because of safety concerns 
linked to withdrawal symptoms rather than a perceived 
need for the antidepressant per se. Finally, approximately 
25% participants wrote about the alternative activities and 
treatments that they believed could aid recovery. One in six 
wrote about their perceptions of the importance of therapy 
or counseling either as an alternative to, or in combination 
with, antidepressant medication.
strengths and limitations
This study provides insight into the experiences of patients 
who chose to use antidepressants for longer term. The study 
relies on the self-reports of patients. While it could be argued 
that the high rates of adverse effects result from a biased 
sample, this seems unlikely as the majority (89.4%) of patients 
reported a reduction in depression and other benefits. The 
study is less informative about patient-perceived effectiveness 
of antidepressants. Data were not available to allow for an 
examination of changes in patients’ perceptions of antidepres-
sant medication across time, as data with regard to medication 
histories and experiences of relapse were not collected in the 
original survey. This needs to be addressed in future studies 
given the evidence from qualitative research that patients 
develop more concerns about antidepressant medication as 
the number of years of antidepressant use increases.21,22
implications for practice
It has been argued that regular reviews are important with 
patients on long-term antidepressant treatment to monitor 
health status and patient preferences about ongoing use.14 
This study supports these conclusions. Furthermore, patients 
who wish to discontinue after long-term treatment will need 
information about what to expect and support to cope with 
the potentially severe discontinuation effects. Some patients 
in this study reported benefits from a combination of anti-
depressant treatment and psychological therapy. There is 
also evidence that patients experience less relapse if they 
have received cognitive behavioral therapy.23 Hence, it may 
be helpful for patients to complete a course of cognitive 
behavioral therapy or other evidence-based therapy prior to 
discontinuing treatment.

preference and adherence throughout the therapeutic continuum. Patient 
satisfaction, acceptability, quality of life, compliance, persistence and their 
role in  
developing new therapeutic modalities and compounds to optimize 
clinical  
outcomes for existing disease states are major areas of interest for 
the  
journal. This journal has been accepted for indexing on PubMed Central.
