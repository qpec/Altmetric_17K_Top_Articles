Abstract
Sleep disconnects animals from the external world, at considerable risks and costs that must be 
offset by a vital benefit. Insight into this mysterious benefit will come from understanding sleep 
homeostasis: to monitor sleep need, an internal bookkeeper must track physiological changes that 
are linked to the core function of sleep1. In Drosophila, a crucial component of the machinery for 
sleep homeostasis is a cluster of neurons innervating the dorsal fan-shaped body (dFB) of the 
central complex2,3. Artificial activation of these cells induces sleep2, whereas reductions in 
excitability cause insomnia3,4. dFB neurons in sleep-deprived flies tend to be electrically active, 
with high input resistances and long membrane time constants, while neurons in rested flies tend 
to be electrically silent3. Correlative evidence thus supports the simple view that homeostatic sleep 
control works by switching sleep-promoting neurons between active and quiescent states3. Here 
we demonstrate state switching by dFB neurons, identify dopamine as a neuromodulator that 
operates the switch, and delineate the switching mechanism. Arousing dopamine4–8 caused 
transient hyperpolarization of dFB neurons within tens of milliseconds and lasting excitability 
suppression within minutes. Both effects were transduced by Dop1R2 receptors and mediated by 
potassium conductances. The switch to electrical silence involved the downregulation of voltage-
gated A-type currents carried by Shaker and Shab and the upregulation of voltage-independent 
leak currents through a two-pore domain potassium channel we term Sandman. Sandman is 
encoded by the CG8713 gene and translocates to the plasma membrane in response to dopamine. 
dFB-restricted interference with the expression of Shaker or Sandman decreased or increased 
sleep, respectively, by slowing the repetitive discharge of dFB neurons in the ON state or blocking 
their entry into the OFF state. Biophysical changes in a small population of neurons are thus 
linked to the control of sleep-wake state.
We recorded from dFB neurons (which were marked by R23E10-GAL4 or R23E10-LexA 
driven GFP expression3) while head-fixed flies walked or rested on a spherical treadmill.

 Because inactivity is a necessary correlate but insufficient proof of sleep, we restricted our 
analysis to awakening, which we defined as a locomotor bout following ≥5 minutes of 
rest9,10, during which the recorded dFB neuron had been persistently spiking. To deliver 
wake-promoting signals, we expressed the optogenetic actuator5,11 CsChrimson under TH-
GAL4 control in the majority of dopaminergic neurons, including the PPL1 and PPM3 
clusters12, whose FB-projecting members have been implicated in sleep control4,8. 
Illumination at 630 nm, sustained for 1.5 s to release a bolus of dopamine (Extended Data 
Fig. 1), effectively stimulated locomotion (32/38 trials; Fig. 1a, b). dFB neurons paused in 
successful (but not in unsuccessful) trials (Fig. 1a, b), and their membrane potentials dipped 
by 2–13 mV (7.50 ± 0.56 mV; mean ± s.e.m.) below the baseline during tonic activity (Fig. 
1a, c). When flies bearing an undriven CsChrimson transgene were photostimulated, neither 
physiological nor behavioural changes were apparent (Fig. 1d-f). The tight correlation 
between the suppression of dFB neuron spiking and the initiation of movement (P<0.0001, 
Fisher’s exact test) might, however, merely mirror a causal dopamine effect elsewhere, as 
TH-GAL4 labels dopaminergic neurons throughout the brain12. Because localized 
dopamine applications to dFB neuron dendrites similarly caused awakening (Fig. 3d, 
below), we consider this possibility remote.
Flies with enhanced dopaminergic transmission exhibit a short-sleeping phenotype that 
requires the presence of a D1-like receptor in dFB neurons4,8, suggesting that dopamine 
acts directly on these cells. dFB-restricted RNA-mediated interference (RNAi) confirmed 
this notion and pinpointed Dop1R2 as the responsible receptor (Fig. 2a), a conclusion 
reinforced by analysis of the mutant Dop1R2MI08664 allele (Extended Data Fig. 2a-c). Prior 
evidence that Dop1R1, a receptor not involved in regulating baseline sleep8, confers 
responsiveness to dopamine when expressed in the dFB4,8 indicates that either D1-like 
receptor can fulfill the role normally played by Dop1R2. Loss of Dop1R2 increased sleep 
during the day and the late hours of the night, by prolonging sleep bouts without affecting 
their frequency (Extended Data Fig. 2a, d, e). This sleep pattern is consistent with reduced 
sensitivity to a dopaminergic arousal signal.
To confirm the identity of the effective transmitter, avoid dopamine release outside the dFB, 
and reduce the transgene load for subsequent experiments, we replaced optogenetic 
manipulations of the dopaminergic system with pressure ejections of dopamine onto dFB 
neuron dendrites (Fig. 2b). Like optogenetically stimulated secretion, focal application of 
dopamine hyperpolarized the cells and suppressed their spiking (Fig. 2c, Extended Data Fig. 
3a, b). The inhibitory responses could be blocked at several nodes of an intracellular 
signaling pathway that connects the activation of dopamine receptors to the opening of 
potassium conductances (Fig. 2c, Extended Data Fig. 3b): by RNAi-mediated knockdown of 
Dop1R2; by the inclusion in the patch pipette of pertussis toxin (PTX), which inactivates 
heterotrimeric G-proteins of the Gi/o family13; and by replacing intracellular potassium with 
caesium, which obstructs the pores of G-protein-coupled inward-rectifier channels14. 
Elevating the chloride reversal potential above resting potential left the polarity of the 
responses unchanged (Fig. 2c, Extended Data Fig. 3b), corroborating that potassium 
conductances mediate the bulk of dopaminergic inhibition.

 Coupling of Dop1R2 to Gi/o, though documented in a heterologous system15, represents a 
sufficiently unusual transduction mechanism for a predicted D1-like receptor to prompt us to 
verify its significance. Like the loss of Dop1R2, temperature-inducible expression of PTX in 
dFB neurons increased overall sleep time by extending sleep bout length (Extended Data 
Fig. 2f, g).
While a single pulse of dopamine transiently hyperpolarized dFB neurons and inhibited their 
spiking, prolonged dopamine applications (50 ms pulses at 10 Hz, or 20 Hz optogenetic 
stimulation, both sustained for 2–10 min) switched the cells from electrical excitability (ON) 
to quiescence (OFF) (Fig. 3a-c, Extended Data Fig. 4a-c). The switching process required 
dopamine as well as Dop1R2 (Fig. 3b, c), but once the switch had been actuated the cells 
remained in the OFF state—and flies, awake (Fig. 3d)—without a steady supply of 
transmitter. Input resistances and membrane time constants dropped to 53.3 ± 1.8 and 24.0 
± 1.3% of their initial values (means ± s.e.m., n=15 cells; Fig. 3b,c), and depolarizing 
currents no longer elicited action potentials (15/15 cells) (Fig. 3a, Extended Data Fig. 4a). 
The biophysical properties of single dFB neurons, recorded in the same individual before 
and after operating the dopamine switch, varied as widely as those in sleep-deprived and 
rested flies3.
Dopamine-induced changes in input resistance and membrane time constant occurred from 
similar baselines in all genotypes (Extended Data Fig. 5a, b) and followed single-
exponential kinetics with time constants of 1.07–1.10 minutes (Fig. 3b, c). The speed of 
conversion points to posttranslational modification and/or translocation of ion channels 
between intracellular pools and the plasma membrane as the underlying mechanism(s). In 
7/15 cases, we held recordings long enough to observe the spontaneous recommencement of 
spiking (Fig. 3a, d), which was accompanied by a rise to baseline of input resistance and 
membrane time constant, after 7–60 minutes of quiescence (mean ± s.e.m = 25.86 ± 7.61 
minutes). The temporary suspension of electrical output is thus part of the normal activity 
cycle of dFB neurons and not a dead end brought on by our experimental conditions.
dFB neurons in the ON state expressed two types of potassium current: voltage-dependent 
A-type16 and voltage-independent non-A-type currents (Fig. 3e-g, Extended Data Fig. 6a-c). 
The current-voltage (I-V) relation of IA resembled that of Shaker, the prototypical A-type 
channel17,18: no current flowed below –50 mV, the approximate voltage threshold of 
Shaker17,18; above –40 mV, peak currents increased steeply with voltage (Fig. 3e, f) and 
inactivated with a time constant18 of 7.5 ± 2.1 ms (mean ± s.e.m., n=7 cells; Extended Data 
Fig. 6c, d). Non-A-type currents showed weak outward rectification with a reversal potential 
of –80 mV (Fig. 3e, g), consistent with potassium as the permeant ion, and no inactivation 
(Extended Data Fig. 6b).
Switching the neurons OFF changed both types of potassium current. IA diminished by one 
third (Fig. 3e, f), whereas Inon-A nearly quadrupled when quantified between resting 
potential and spike threshold (Fig. 3g). The weak rectification of Inon-A in the ON state 
vanished in the OFF state, giving way to the linear I-V relationship of an ideal leak 
conductance (Fig. 3e, g). dFB neurons thus upregulate IA in the sleep-promoting ON state 
(Fig. 3e, f). When dopamine switches the cells OFF, voltage-dependent currents are

 attenuated and leak currents augmented (Fig. 3e-g). This see-saw form of regulation should 
be sensitive to perturbations of the neurons’ ion channel inventory: depletion of voltage-
gated A-type (KV) channels (which predominate in the ON state) should tip the cells toward 
the OFF state; conversely, loss of leak channels (which predominate in the OFF state) should 
favour the ON state. To test these predictions, we examined sleep in flies carrying R23E10-
GAL4 driven RNAi transgenes for dFB-restricted interference with individual potassium 
channels.
RNAi-mediated knockdown of two of the five KV channel types of Drosophila19 (Shaker 
and Shab) reduced sleep relative to parental controls, while knockdown of the remaining 
three types had no effect (Fig. 4a). Biasing the potassium channel repertoire of dFB neurons 
against A-type conductances thus tilts the neurons’ excitable state toward quiescence (Fig. 
4b-f), causing insomnia (Fig. 4a), but leaves transient and sustained dopamine responses 
unaffected (Fig. 4e-g, Extended Data Fig. 3b). The seemingly counterintuitive conclusion 
that reducing a potassium current would decrease, not increase, action potential discharge is 
explained by a requirement for A-type channels in generating repetitive activity16,20 of the 
kind displayed by dFB neurons during sleep (Fig. 1). Depleting Shaker from dFB neurons 
shifted the interspike interval distribution toward longer values (Fig. 4d), as would be 
expected if KV channels with slow inactivation kinetics replaced rapidly inactivating Shaker 
as the principal force opposing the generation of the next spike. These findings identify a 
potential mechanism for the short-sleeping phenotypes caused by mutations in shaker21, its 
β subunit hyperkinetic22, or its regulator sleepless23 (Extended Data Fig. 7).
Leak conductances are typically formed by two-pore domain potassium (K2P) channels24. 
dFB-restricted RNAi of one member of the 11-strong family of Drosophila K2P channels19, 
encoded by the CG8713 gene, increased sleep relative to parental controls; interference with 
the remaining 10 K2P channels had no effect (Fig. 4a). Recordings from dFB neurons after 
knock-down of the CG8713 gene product, which we term Sandman, revealed undiminished 
non-A-type currents in the ON state (Fig. 4c) and intact responses to a single pulse of 
dopamine (Fig. 4g, Extended Data Fig. 3b) but a defective OFF switch: during prolonged 
dopamine applications, Inon-A failed to rise (Fig. 4c), input resistances and membrane time 
constants remained at their elevated levels (Fig. 4b, e, f, Extended Data Fig. 5), and the 
neurons continued to fire action potentials (7/7 cells) (Fig. 4b). Blocking vesicle exocytosis 
in the recorded cell with botulinum neurotoxin C (BoNT/C)25 similarly disabled the OFF 
switch (Fig. 4c, e, f). This, combined with the absence of detectable Sandman currents in the 
ON state (Fig. 4c), suggests that Sandman is internalized in electrically active cells and 
recycled to the plasma membrane when dopamine switches the neurons OFF.
Because dFB neurons lacking Sandman spike persistently even after prolonged dopamine 
exposure (Fig. 4b), voltage-gated sodium channels remain functional in the OFF state. The 
difficulty of driving control cells to action potential threshold in this state (Fig. 3a, Extended 
Data Fig. 4a) must therefore be due to a lengthening of electrotonic distance between sites of 
current injection and spike generation. This lengthening is an expected consequence of a 
current leak, which may uncouple the axonal spike generator from somatodendritic synaptic 
inputs or pacemaker currents when sleep need is low.

 The two kinetically and mechanistically distinct actions of dopamine on dFB neurons—
instant, but transient, hyperpolarization and a delayed, but lasting, switch in excitable state—
ensure that transitions to vigilance can be both immediate and sustained, providing speedy 
alarm responses and stable homeostatic control. The key to stability lies in the switching 
behaviour of dFB neurons, which is driven by dopaminergic input accumulated over time. 
Unlike bistable neurons26–28, in which two activity regimes coexist for the same set of 
conductances, dFB neurons switch regimes only when their membrane current densities 
change. Our analysis of how dopamine effects such a change, from activity to silence, has 
uncovered elements familiar from other modulated systems20,27–30: simultaneous, 
antagonistic regulation of multiple conductances20,29; reduction of IA (ref. 20); and 
modulation of leak currents24. We currently know little about the reverse transition, from 
silence to activity, except that mutating the Rho-GTPase-activating protein Crossveinless-c 
locks dFB neurons in the OFF state, resulting in severe insomnia and an inability to correct 
sleep deficits3. Discovering the signals and processes that switch sleep-promoting neurons 
back ON will hold important clues to the vital function of sleep.
Methods
Drosophila strains and culture
Driver lines R23E10-GAL4 or R23E10-LexA31 and TH-GAL432 were used to target dFB 
neurons and dopaminergic neurons, respectively. Effector transgenes encoded fluorescent 
markers for visually guided patch-clamp recordings (UAS-CD8::GFP33 and lexAop-
CD2::GFP34); a temperature-inducible system35 for the expression of pertussis toxin36 
(UAS-PTX; tubP-GAL80ts); the optogenetic actuator CsChrimson37; and RNAi 
constructs38, along with UAS-Dcr2, to interfere with the expression of the dopamine 
receptors Dop1R1 (107058KK), Dop1R2 (105324KK), DopR2 (11471GD), and DopEcR 
(103494KK); the KV channels Shaker (104474KK), Shab (102218KK), Shal (103363KK), 
Shaw (110589KK), and Shawl (100980KK); the interacting partners of Shaker, Hyperkinetic 
(101402KK) and Sleepless (104533KK); and the K2P channels Task7 (8565GD), Task6 
(9073GD), Ork1 (104883KK), CG1688 (30270GD), CG10864 (8302GD), CG34396 
(100436KK), CG43155 (101483KK), CG42594 (46415GD), CG8713 (47977GD), CG9194 
(110628KK), and CG42340 (104521KK). Codes in parentheses identify transformants in the 
GD and KK libraries of the Vienna Drosophila Resource Center. The genotype of control 
flies in electrophysiological experiments was w1118; UAS-CD8::GFP; R23E10-GAL4.
Fly stocks were grown on media of sucrose, yeast, molasses, and agar under a 12 h light : 
12h dark cycle at 25 °C unless they expressed GAL80ts; in this case the experimental 
animals and all relevant controls were grown at 18°C. Flies expressing CsChrimson were 
transferred to food supplemented with 2 mM all-trans retinal upon eclosion. All studies were 
performed on animals aged 3–10 days. Flies were routinely sleep-deprived39 for >12 h 
before electrophysiological recordings to increase the likelihood of finding dFB neurons in 
the electrically active ON state after break-in.

 Movement tracking, electrophysiology, and optogenetics
Male and female flies with a dorsal cranial window were head-fixed to a custom mount, 
using thermoplastic wax with a melting point of 52 °C (Agar Scientific), and placed on a 
spherical treadmill40,41. The treadmill consisted of an air-supported trackball made of 
extruded styrofoam (13 mm diameter; 50 mg) in a 14 mm tube. An image of a small region 
of the ball’s surface under 640 nm LED illumination was relayed onto the sensor of an 
optical mouse (Logitec M-U0017). The sensor was interfaced with a microcontroller board 
(Arduino Due) based on the Atmel SAM3X CPU and read out in real time using the onboard 
D/A converter. The resolution of the readout corresponds to 4 mm/s increments in the 
tangential speed of the trackball.
The brain was continuously superfused with extracellular solution equilibrated with 95% 
O2-5% CO2 and containing 103 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, 5 mM TES, 8 mM trehalose, 10 mM 
glucose, 7 mM sucrose, 26 mM NaHCO3, 1 mM NaH2PO4, 1.5 mM CaCl2, 4 mM MgCl2, 
pH 7.3. Somata of GFP-labeled dFB neurons were visually targeted with borosilicate glass 
electrodes (7-13 MΩ). The internal solution contained 140 mM potassium aspartate, 10 mM 
HEPES, 1 mM KCl, 4 mM MgATP, 0.5 mM Na3GTP, 1 mM EGTA, pH 7.3. Where 
indicated, 140 mM potassium aspartate was replaced with 140 mM KCl or 140 mM caesium 
aspartate, or the internal solution was supplemented with 2 µg/ml pertussis toxin (Tocris) or 
1.5 µg/ml botulinum neurotoxin C light chain (List Biological Laboratories). Neurons were 
dialyzed with toxin-containing internal solutions for 10–15 min before measurements.
Signals were acquired with a Multiclamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices), filtered at 6–
10 kHz, and digitized at 10–20 kHz using an ITC-18 data acquisition board (InstruTECH) 
controlled by the Nclamp/Neuromatic package. Data were analyzed using Neuromatic 
software (www.neuromatic.thinkrandom.com) and custom procedures in Igor Pro 
(Wavemetrics) and MATLAB (The MathWorks).
Voltage-clamp experiments were performed in the presence of 1 µM tetrodotoxin (Tocris) 
and 200 nM cadmium to block sodium and calcium channels, respectively. Neurons were 
taken in 10 mV increments from holding potentials of –110 or –30 mV to test potentials 
between –100 and 40 mV (Extended Data Fig. 6a, b). When the cells were held at –110 mV, 
depolarization steps (1 s duration) elicited the full complement of potassium currents; when 
the cells were held at –30 mV, voltage-gated channels inactivated and the evoked potassium 
currents lacked the IA (A-type or fast outward) component42. The non A-type component 
was quantified at the steady state (end) of the current response. Digital subtraction of the 
non-A-type component from the full complement of potassium currents (that is, the currents 
evoked from a hyperpolarized holding potential of –110 mV) gave an estimate of IA 
(Extended Data Fig. 6c), which was taken to be the difference between the peak current and 
any residual steady state current in the difference trace.
Interspike intervals were determined from voltage responses to a standard series of 
depolarizing current steps (5 pA increments from 0 to 150 pA, 1 s duration). Spikes were 
detected by finding minima in the second derivative of the membrane potential trace. 
Interspike intervals at all levels of injected current were pooled for the calculation of 
frequency distributions.

 For photostimulation of CsChrimson-expressing neurons37, a 630 nm LED (Multicomp 
OSW-4388) was focused onto the head of the fly with a 60 mm lens (Thorlabs) and 
controlled by a TTL-triggered dimmable constant current LED driver (Recom 
RCD-24-0.70/W/X3). Optical power at the sample was ~28 mW/cm2. To induce state 
switching, light was delivered in a pulsatile fashion in 5 s cycles. The first 3.5 s of each cycle 
consisted of 20 Hz trains of 3 ms optical pulses. Illumination was paused during the 
remaining 1.5 s of each cycle, and a hyperpolarizing current pulse (–10 pA; 1s) was applied 
to determine the membrane resistance and time constant.
For pharmacological applications of dopamine, patch pipettes were filled with 10 mM 
dopamine in extracellular solution and positioned in the centre of the GFP-labeled dendritic 
tuft of dFB neurons. To elicit transient dopamine responses, pressure (68 kPa) was applied in 
250 ms pulses (Picospritzer III), resulting in the ejection of ~40 pl of solution. To induce 
state switching, dopamine was delivered in a pulsatile fashion in 5 s cycles. The first 3.5 s of 
each cycle consisted of 10 Hz trains of 50 ms pressure pulses. Dopamine delivery was 
paused during the remaining 1.5 s of each cycle, and a hyperpolarizing current pulse (–10 
pA; 1s) was applied to determine the membrane resistance and time constant.
Sleep measurements
Female flies were individually inserted into 65 mm glass tubes, loaded into the Trikinetics 
Drosophila Activity Monitor system, and housed under 12 h light : 12h dark conditions. 
Periods of inactivity (no beam breaks) lasting at least 5 minutes were classified as sleep9,10. 
Immobile flies (< 2 beam breaks per 24 h) were excluded from analysis. Group sizes for 
sleep measurements (typically n=16 flies; in some cases multiples of 16) reflect the capacity 
of the Trikinetics Drosophila Activity Monitors, which were designed to accommodate 16 
experimental flies along with 16 controls.
Statistics
Data were analyzed in Prism 6 (GraphPad). Group means were compared by one-way or 
two-way ANOVA, using repeated measures designs where appropriate, followed by planned 
pairwise post hoc analyses using Holm-Šídák’s multiple comparisons test. Where the 
assumptions of normality or sphericity were violated (as indicated by Shapiro-Wilk and 
Brown-Forsythe tests, respectively), group means were compared by two-sided Mann-
Whitney or Kruskal-Wallis tests, the latter followed by Dunn’s multiple comparisons test. 
Contingencies between the suppression of dFB neuron activity and awakening were 
analyzed by Fisher’s exact test. Interspike interval distributions were evaluated by 
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, using the Bonferroni correction to adjust the level of statistical 
significance. No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample sizes.

Dop1R2MB05108 allele (P=0.6750). The Dop1R2MB05108 allele contains a transposon 
insertion in a non-coding region of the Dop1R2 gene, which reduces mRNA levels in 
homozygous carriers by only 14% (ref. 4), thus explaining the lack of a phenotype. The 
inability of Dop1R2MB05108 to suppress the short-sleeping phenotype of flies with enhanced 
dopaminergic transmission4 does therefore not argue against a role of Dop1R2 in the dFB.

Flies expressing CsChrimson under TH-GAL4 control in dopaminergic neurons were 
photostimulated with 3 ms pulses of 630 nm light at 20 Hz. a, Voltage responses to identical 
current steps were recorded in the same cell, before and after optogenetic stimulation of 
dopaminergic neurons (black and red traces). Red and gray traces in the OFF state (right) 
indicate current injections matching or exceeding those shown in the ON state, respectively 
(left). b,c, Time courses of changes in input resistance (Rm) and membrane time constant 
(Tm) of dFB neurons during optogenetic stimulation of dopaminergic neurons (n=7 cells). 
Data are means ± s.e.m. One-way repeated-measures ANOVA detected significant effects of 
time (P=0.0135 for Rm; P=0.0222 for Tm).

 Extended Data Figure 6. Measurements of potassium currents in voltage clamp.
a, Voltage steps from a holding potential of –110 mV (top) elicited the full complement of 
potassium currents expressed by a dFB neuron (Itotal, bottom). b, Stepping the same neuron 
from a holding potential of –30 mV (top) elicited potassium currents lacking the A-type 
component (Inon-A, bottom). c, Digital subtraction of Inon-A (b, bottom) from Itotal (a, 
bottom) yielded an estimate of IA. Note the expanded timescale. d, Individual (gray) and 
average (black) A-type currents of 7 dFB neurons, evoked by step depolarization to 40 mV. 
The magenta line represents a single-exponential fit to the average.

a, A switching cycle in current clamp. Voltage responses to current steps were recorded in 
the same cell, before and after the application of dopamine. Red and gray traces in the OFF 
state (centre) indicate responses to current injections matching or exceeding those in the ON 
states, respectively. b,c, Time courses of changes in input resistance (Rm) and membrane 
time constant (Tm) of dFB neurons during the application of dopamine, in controls (black, 
n=15 cells) and cells expressing R23E10-GAL4 driven RNAi targeting Dop1R2 (red, n=8

opposing effects on sleep.
a, Sleep in flies expressing R23E10-GAL4 driven RNAi targeting KV or K2P channels and 
parental controls (circles: individual flies; horizontal lines: group means). One-way ANOVA 
detected significant genotype effects (P<0.0001 for KV channels; P<0.0001 for K2P

means ± s.e.m. Two-way repeated-measures ANOVA detected significant effects of 
experimental condition (P=0.0426) and neuronal state (P<0.0001) on IA, and a significant 
interaction between experimental condition and neuronal state for Inon-A (P=0.0018). IA was 
reduced in cells expressing ShakerRNAi relative to all other groups (P=0.0409). Inon-A 
differed between ON and OFF states in controls (P=0.0005) and cells expressing ShakerRNAi 
(P=0.0003), but not in cells expressing SandmanRNAi (P=0.9119) or containing BoNT/C
