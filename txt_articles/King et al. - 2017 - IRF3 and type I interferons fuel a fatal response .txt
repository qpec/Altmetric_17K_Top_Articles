 Interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and type I interferons (IFNs) protect against infections1 and 
cancer2, but excessive IRF3 activation and type I IFN production cause auto-inflammatory 
conditions such as Aicardi Goutieres Syndrome3,4 and STING-associated vasculopathy of infancy 
(SAVI)3. Myocardial infarction (MI) elicits inflammation5, but the dominant molecular drivers of 
MI-associated inflammation remain unclear. Here, we show that ischemic cell death in the heart 
fuels a fatal response to myocardial infarction by activating IRF3 and type I IFN production. In 
mice, single cell RNA-Seq analysis of 4,215 leukocytes isolated from infarcted and non-infarcted 
hearts revealed that MI provokes activation of an IRF3-interferon axis in a distinct population of 
interferon inducible cells (IFNICs that were classified as cardiac macrophages). Mice genetically 
deficient in cGAS, its adaptor STING, IRF3, or the type I interferon receptor IFNAR exhibited 
impaired interferon stimulated gene (ISG) expression and, in the case of mice deficient in IRF3 or 
IFNAR, improved survival after MI as compared to controls. Interruption of IRF3-dependent 
signaling resulted in decreased cardiac expression of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines and 
decreased cardiac inflammatory cell infiltration, as well as in attenuated ventricular dilation and 
improved cardiac function. Similarly, treatment of mice with an IFNAR neutralizing antibody after 
MI ablated the IFN response and improved left ventricular dysfunction and survival. These results 
identify IRF3 and the type I interferon response as a potential therapeutic target for post-MI 
cardioprotection.
SUMMARY
The massive cell death that occurs during myocardial infarction releases self-DNA and triggers an 
interferon response in infiltrating leukocytes via a cGAS-STING-IRF3 pathway. In mice subjected 
to myocardial infarction, genetic disrupton of this pathway or antibody blockade of the type I 
interferon receptor improved heart function and survival.
Myocardial infarction (MI) causes massive synchronous cell death in the heart and 
catastrophically releases innate immune-stimulating damage associated molecular patterns 
(DAMPs). Although the molecular nature of the dominant MI-induced DAMPs remains 
undefined, these DAMPs are thought to be sensed by Toll like receptors (TLRs) of 
infiltrating cells and to fuel post-MI inflammation by activating the transcription factor NF-
κB and expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, pro-IL1β, and IL66,7. 
Unfortunately, despite the association between inflammation and poor clinical outcomes, 
efforts to limit post-MI- and heart failure-associated inflammation with steroidal or non-
steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs that target NF-κB-dependent signaling have failed to show 
benefit8. Thus, an improved molecular understanding of MI danger signaling might enable 
more effective post-MI cardioprotection8.
Cytosolic nucleic acid sensors initiate TLR-independent responses that protect against 
infection by invading pathogens1,9. For example, during viral or intracellular bacterial 
infection, the cytosolic DNA sensor cGAS detects pathogen DNA10 and catalyzes the 
synthesis of the cyclic dinucleotide cGAMP11, which signals via the adaptor STING12, 
facilitates TBK1-dependent IRF3 activation13, and orchestrates a gene expression program 
characterized by IFNβ production and the type I interferon response. Meanwhile, DNA 
abounds in every mammalian cell, but avoids spontaneous self-stimulation through nuclear 
and mitochondrial compartmentalization14 and through enzymatic digestion by patrolling

 endosomal and cytosolic DNases15,16. We hypothesized that the high levels of ischemic cell 
death during MI may disrupt DNA sequestration and liberate large quantities of self-DNA 
for cytosolic sensing, ultimately fueling a maladaptive IRF3-dependent innate immune 
response. To test this hypothesis, we studied IRF3 and the type I IFN response following 
permanent coronary ligation (MI) in mice.
Since IRF3 and type I IFNs lack established roles in ischemic heart disease, we first 
evaluated whether IRF3 is activated by MI in wild type (WT) mice. Despite the absence of 
infection in this setting, we detected increased levels of phosphorylated IRF3 (Fig. 1a, 
Supplementary Fig. 1a) and robust induction of prototypical IRF3-dependent cytokines 
(Ifnb1) and chemokines (Cxcl10) (Fig. 1b–c) on day 4 after MI; the increase in Ifnb1 was 
detected as early as day 1 after MI (Supplementary Fig. 1b). In contrast to WT mice, IRF3 
knockout mice (Irf3−/−) showed a near complete abrogation of the MI-induced type I IFN 
response (Fig. 1b–c). Type I IFNs such as Ifnb1 amplify immune responses by binding to 
cell-surface interferon alpha receptors (Ifnar), leading to induction of diverse effectors 
known as interferon stimulated genes (ISGs). Consistent with this concept, we detected 
marked increases in the levels of many ISGs in WT mice, but negligible induction in 
comparably treated Irf3−/− mice on day 4 after MI (Fig 1d). By comparison, Irf3 deficiency 
had a less severe effect on the mRNAs that encode prototypical NF-κB-dependent 
inflammatory cytokines such as Tnf, Il1b, and Il6 (Supplementary Fig. 2). Genome-wide 
expression profiling of WT and Irf3−/− mice using RNA-seq confirmed these findings and 
showed that ISGs were among the most highly differentially expressed genes after MI (P < 
1×10−12) (Fig. 1e, Supplementary Fig. 3).
To determine whether the interferon response is a specialized function of specific cells in the 
infarct, we performed single cell RNA-Seq profiling of 4,215 single cells using microfluidic 
inDrop barcoding (n=1858 and n=1654 CD45+ sorted infarct leukocytes from post-MI day 4 
WT and Irf3−/− hearts, respectively, and n=703 unsorted cells from the ventricular apex of 
non-infarcted WT hearts). Unbiased clustering of the cells from post-MI WT hearts 
identified a unique population of interferon inducible cells (IFNICs) closely associated with 
mononuclear cell clusters (Fig. 1f). Based on analysis of marker gene expression as well as 
calculation of an IRF3 Score (Ifit1, Ifit2, Ifit3) defined as the summed expression of three 
genes previously identified direct IRF3-dependent genes, IFNICs were identified as 
specialized producers of ISGs and IRF3-dependent genes (Fig. 1g–h, Supplementary Tables 
1–7)17,18. In contrast, we did not detect IFNICs by single cell analysis of post-MI day 4 
Irf3−/− infarcts or of non-infarcted WT hearts (Supplementary Fig. 4).
Next, we explored which cell populations account for IRF3-dependent gene expression after 
MI using fluorescence activated cell sorting. Cells were sorted from the infarct region at day 
4 based on cell surface CD45 and CD11b staining and were assessed for expression of IRF3-
dependent genes. CD45+ and CD11b+ subpopulations, but not CD45- or CD11b- 
subpopulations, reliably expressed Ifnb1 (Fig. 2a–b). Parabiosis experiments, in which 
Irf3−/− mice underwent coronary artery ligation after having been paired with either WT or 
Irf3−/− mice, revealed that, after MI, circulating cells enter the heart and significantly 
increase expression of IRF3-dependent genes (Fig. 2c). These data indicate that IFNICs are 
blood derived.

 To study how IRF3-dependent responses are initiated after MI, we created a reporter mouse 
(Myh6Cre-mTmG) in which only cardiomyocytes express membrane EGFP (green), 
whereas all non-cardiomyocytes express membrane tdTomato (red)19. This approach 
enabled us to identify infiltrating cells with the greatest exposure to cardiomyocyte-derived 
DAMPs (red cells with green fluorescence above background). On day 4 after MI, we 
isolated CD11b+ cells associated with cardiomyocyte debris by gating on red cells with GFP 
levels above a stringently defined background (Fig. 2d–h, Supplementary Fig. 5). This 
CD11b+GFP+ population consisted almost exclusively of F4/80hiLy6Clo cells 
(macrophages), which we termed post-phagocytotic macrophages (Fig. 2f). These CD11b
+GFP+ cells expressed significantly more Ifnb1 than did CD11b+GFP− cells (Fig. 2g). In 
contrast, both CD11b+ cell populations expressed similar amounts of ISGs (Fig. 2h). 
Together, these results indicate that DAMP sensing by infarct phagocytes leads to type I 
interferon production, which secondarily induces ISG expression in nearby cells, regardless 
of their direct association with the initiating cardiomyocyte DAMP. To visualize the spatial 
distribution of interferon-responsive cells, we created an interferon-inducible reporter mouse 
(Mx1Cre mT/mG) expressing membrane tdTomato (red) in all cells except those induced to 
express Cre recombinase by endogenous activation of the interferon-sensitive Mx1-
promoter, which changes reporter expression to membrane EGFP (green)4,19. On day 4 after 
MI, reporter mice exhibited dense accumulation of green interferon-responsive cells 
throughout the infarct zone (Fig. 2i), but no green interferon-responsive cells were 
morphologically consistent with the large sarcomere-containing appearance of a typical 
cardiomyocyte, which suggests that non-myocytes are the interferon-responsive cell type.
We next investigated whether the interferon response impacted the extent and quality of 
immune cell infiltrate. Immunohistochemical staining and multi-photon autofluorescence 
microscopy showed reduced accumulation of leukocytes in the borderzone region in Irf3−/− 
compared to WT mice at day 4 after MI (Fig. 2j, Supplementary Fig. 6a–b). Using flow 
cytometry, we found that the decreased amount of infarct infiltrate in Irf3−/− compared to 
WT mice resulted from a decrease in the F4/80lowLy6Chi pro-inflammatory monocyte 
population (Fig. 2k). By comparison, the size of the F4/80hi Ly6Clow phagocytic 
macrophage population was only modestly affected. These observations are consistent with 
findings that, as compared to Irf3−/− mice, WT mice showed increased expression of cell 
surface leukocyte adhesion molecules and leukocyte recruitment chemokines, which 
facilitate leukocyte infarct infiltration (Supplementary Fig. 6c–d). Next, we examined 
expression in our single-cell RNA-Seq data of mononuclear cell surface markers recently 
linked to ontologic and phenotypic subsets of leukocytes. This analysis identified IFNICs as 
Adgre1+ (F4/80) H2.Aa+ (MHCII) Ccr2+ Ly6c2- (Ly6C) cells (Fig. 2l), classifying them as 
a monocyte-derived cardiac macrophage20. This cell population was not identifiable by 
analysis of the single-cell RNA-Seq data derived from leukocytes of Irf3−/− mice or of WT 
sham controls (Supplementary Fig. 4c–d). Taken together, these results suggest that 
interactions of infarct phagocytes with cardiomyocyte debris fuel IRF3-dependent leukocyte 
recruitment and amplify inflammation after MI.
We next sought to determine the dominant DAMP responsible for MI-induced IRF3 
activation. Three adaptor proteins can activate IRF321: TIR-domain-containing adapter 
inducing interferon beta (TRIF)22, Mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS)23, and

 Stimulator of interferon genes (STING)12,24 (Fig. 3a). By subjecting mice functionally 
deficient in each adaptor to MI, we found that STINGgt/gt mice most closely replicate the 
Irf3−/− post-MI expression pattern: as compared to WT mice, STINGgt/gt mice showed 
reduced Ifnb1 expression and a near complete abrogation of Cxcl10, Irf7, and Ifit1 
expression despite no significant decreases in the expression of cytosolic DNA sensing 
molecules (Fig. 3b, Supplementary Fig. 2e–i).
Cytosolic double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) is the only endogenous DAMP known to activate 
IRF3 via the adaptor STING. It does so via the DNA sensor cyclic GMP-AMP synthase, 
cGAS (Fig. 3c). Indeed, cGAS−/− mice10, like Irf3−/− and STINGgt/gt mice, did not exhibit a 
significant induction of the type I interferon response after MI (Fig. 3d). Similarly, Ifnar−/− 
mice lacking the type I IFN receptor also showed no elevation in interferon stimulated gene 
expression after MI (Fig. 3d). Furthermore, we observed a substantial overlap between the 
genes most differentially expressed in WT as compared to Irf3−/− mice after MI and those 
previously found to be induced by mitochondrial DNA release14, bacterial DNA secretion25, 
or DNA accumulation due to absence of endogenous DNase activity16,26 (Supplementary 
Fig. 3c–d). Together, these results identify the cytosolic DNA sensing pathway as being 
responsible for induction of an IRF3-dependent type I interferon response in the heart after 
MI.
To determine if ischemic injury disrupts intracellular compartmentalization and makes 
cardiomyocyte DNA available for sensing, we performed an ischemia-reperfusion procedure 
in which mice were subjected to 20 minutes of coronary ligation followed by reperfusion; 
the restoration of flow was used to allow delivery of DNA-binding-dependent fluorescent 
probes, PicoGreen or Sytox Orange. Using gated intravital microscopy in the beating heart, 
we found that the DNA probes localized exclusively to the nucleus of intact surviving cells, 
whereas they spread throughout the cytosol of injured cells (Fig. 3e–f, Supplementary Fig. 
7).
Next, we devised an experiment to determine whether infiltrating cells access cardiomyocyte 
DNA in the infarct in vivo. Cardiomyocyte DNA was indelibly labeled in utero by injecting 
pregnant mice with the modified nucleotide EdU. When the offspring grew to adults, the 
location of the covalent DNA-bound EdU was visualized by bioorthogonal click chemistry. 
Cardiomyocytes, which proliferate rapidly in utero but minimally in adulthood, retain the 
label in adult mice, whereas highly proliferative hematopoietic-cells and their leukocyte 
progeny diluted the EdU to undetectable levels (Fig. 3g)27. When we challenged the labeled 
mice with MI, we found some EdU localized to the extranuclear space of infiltrating 
borderzone cells on day 4 after MI, but not to circulating cells of cytospun blood. For 
comparison, when we exposed bone marrow derived macrophages in vitro to EdU-labeled 
DNA extracted from the heart, we observed a similar distribution of EdU labeling of the 
macrophages, together with induction of type I interferon and ISG expression (Fig. 3h, 
Supplementary Fig. 8). Bone marrow derived macrophages from WT mice strongly express 
type I interferons in response to DNA. Macrophages from cGAS, STING or IRF3 deficient 
mice were unable to mount a similar response (Supplementary Fig. 9). Together this 
indicates macrophages can access extracellular DNA and produce type I interferons in a 
cGAS-, STING-, and IRF3-dependent fashion. Together, these findings suggest that

 ischemic cells in the heart release DNA that provokes infarct phagocytes to induce a cGAS- 
and IRF3-dependent type I interferon response.
To determine the functional significance of MI-induced IRF3-activation, we compared 
survival, ventricular remodeling, and contractile function after MI between WT mice and 
mice with impaired interferon signaling. Despite closely matched baseline 
echocardiographic parameters and MRI-assessed infarct size (Supplementary Fig. 10a–d), 
we observed substantial differences in ventricular remodeling and survival between WT 
mice and Irf3−/−, Ifnar−/− or cGAS−/− mice (Fig. 4a–l) Consistent with prior reports28, 61% 
(35/57) of WT male mice survived after MI; these mice showed ventricular rupture between 
days 4–6 (Fig 4a). In contrast, Irf3−/− and Ifnar−/− mice showed virtually completely 
protection from death with 98% survival (44/45) and 100% (31/31) respectively over the 2 
weeks of observation following coronary artery occlusion. cGAS−/− mice also showed a 
significant, although less striking, protection (39/47). In contrast, Stinggt/gt mice showed a 
nonsignificant decrease in mortality (Supplementary Fig. 11), suggesting that other innate 
immune sensors might also participate in IRF3 activation after MI. We also evaluated the 
effects of interferon signaling on ventricular dilation and contractile function, parameters 
that in humans predict symptoms and outcomes in heart failure. Longitudinal assessment of 
ventricular size at days 4, 7, and 21 revealed less dilation of Irf3−/− mice compared to WT 
mice (Supplementary Fig. 12). Echocardiographic and cardiac MRI evaluation on days 4 and 
21 after MI revealed significantly less chamber dilation and greater preservation of 
contractile function in cGAS−/−, Irf3−/−, and IFNAR−/− mice as compared to WT mice (4b-
l). No substantial differences in coronary vascular anatomy, spontaneous reperfusion, or 
recruitment of collateral vessels could be identified between WT and Irf3−/− mice to explain 
the differences in ventricular dilation, contractile function, and survival (Supplementary Fig. 
10e–f).
To test the translational potential of these findings, we treated WT mice with an IFNAR 
neutralizing antibody at 12 and 48 h after MI. Antibody treatment abrogated ISG expression 
and improved ventricular size, contractile function, and survival (Fig. 4m–p). This 
demonstrates that transient inhibition with anti-interferon therapy initiated after coronary 
occlusion protect the recently infarcted ventricle.
In summary, our findings highlight overlap between the protective host response to 
pathogens and its deleterious consequences when activated in the context of sterile ischemic 
injury. We show that MI, which causes ischemic cell death in the heart, activates IRF3 and 
the type I IFN response in a new subpopulation of cardiac macrophages we call IFNICs. 
Pathway activation depends on cytosolic DNA sensing and disruption of the pathway, 
genetically or pharmacologically, reduces inflammation and injury while improving 
ventricular function and survival. (Fig. 5q).
Therapeutically, cancer immunotherapy and vaccine adjuvants aim to boost innate 
immunity29–31. Here, we suggest that transient inhibition of the interferon-dependent innate 
immune response to ischemic cell death could reduce inflammation and limit the adverse 
ventricular remodeling that leads to clinical heart failure. Humans tolerate anti-interferon 
biologics that are in clinical development for rheumatologic indications32–34, suggesting the

 feasibility of targeting the interferon response in MI. The profound effects of IRF3 and the 
type I interferon response on inflammation and ventricular remodeling after myocardial 
infarction expand the role of this response beyond host defense and autoimmunity and 
support its exploration as a new target for post-MI cardioprotection.

Program (EUCOMM)). IRF3−/− mice38 were a generous gift from Tadatsugu Taniguchi and 
provided by Michael Diamond. IFNAR knockout mice (IFNAR−/−) were originally from J. 
Sprent and were backcrossed for 12 generations at the University of Massachusetts Medical 
School and provided by Kate Fitzgerald. Genotyping was performed in-house using methods 
recommended by Jackson Laboratory, or by Transnetyx. All experiments were performed 
with 10 to 25-week-old animals and were carried out using age and gender matched groups 
without randomization. All mice were maintained in a pathogen-free environment of the 
Massachusetts General Hospital of University of Massachusetts animal facilities, and all 
animal experiments were approved by the Subcommittee on Animal Research Care at 
Massachusetts General Hospital or University of Massachusetts.
Myocardial Infarction and Cardioprotective Therapy
Mice were intubated and ventilated with 2% isoflurane. After exposing the heart via 
thoracotomy at the fourth left intercostal space, the left coronary artery was permanently 
ligated with an 8–0 nylon monofilament suture. The thorax was closed with a 5–0 suture. 
Mice were treated with buprenorphine for analgesia on the day of surgery and twice daily 
thereafter for 72 hours. For cardioprotection experiments, mice were treated with two 
intraperitoneal doses of 500 μg of MAR1–5A3 IFNAR neutralizing antibody (BioXCell) at 
8–12 hours and at 48 hours after permanent coronary ligation. Surgeries were performed in a 
blinded fashion unless genotype was obviated by unavoidable ascertainment of features such 
as coat color.
Parabiosis
Mice were joined in parabiosis as previously described.39 Mice were anesthetized with 2% 
isofluorane (2L/min O2). Briefly, after shaving the corresponding lateral aspects of each 
mouse, matching skin incisions were made from behind the ear to the tail of each mouse, 
and the subcutaneous fascia was bluntly dissected to create ~0.5 cm of free skin. The

 scapulas were sutured using mono-nylon 5.0 (Ethicon, Albuquerque, NM), and the dorsal 
and ventral skins were approximated by continuous suture. All mice undergoing parabiosis 
surgeries were injected twice daily with buprenorphine (0.1mg/kg i.p.) for three days 
beginning on the day of surgery. Mice were joined for intervals of 2 weeks before 
proceeding with coronary ligation.
Blood and Heart Tissue Processing
Blood was collected by cardiac puncture. The cellular fraction was collected into EDTA-
containing tubes (Sigma) and erythrocytes were eliminated using red blood cell lysis buffer 
(BioLegend). Heart tissue was collected by incising the right atrium and perfusing 10 mL of 
ice-cold saline into the left ventricular apex. Heart tissue was then removed and used for one 
of several assays detailed below. It was either imaged grossly, embedded in OCT (Sakura, 
Finetek) for frozen sectioning and immunohistochemical staining, placed in RNA Later 
(Qiagen) for RNA extraction and gene expression analysis, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen for 
protein analysis, fixed for 2 hours in 4% paraformaldyhyde for whole mount 
immunofluorescence staining, or freshly cut into short axis sections using a commercial 
heart slicer (Zivic Instruments) and placed between glass coverslips for immediate ex vivo 
imaging of genetically encoded fluorescence or endogenous autofluorescence. To obtain 
single cell suspensions for surface immunostaining, flow cytometric analysis, and FACS 
sorting, hearts were enzymatically digested for 1 hour under continuous agitation in 450 
U/ml collagenase I, 125 U/ml collagenase XI, 60 U/ml DNase I, and 60 U/ml hyaluronidase 
(Sigma) for 1 hour at 37°C, and filtered through a 40 μm nylon mesh in FACS buffer (DPBS 
with 2.5% bovine serum albumin) for enumeration by flow cytometry. For single cell RNA-
Seq, the enzymatic digestion was limited to 45 minutes.
Flow cytometry and Cell sorting
Isolated cells from enzymatically digested hearts were stained at 4°C in FACS buffer with 
mouse hematopoietic lineage markers including phycoerythrin (PE) or avidin-conjugated 
anti-mouse antibodies directed against B220 (BioLegend, clone RA3–6B2), CD49b 
(BioLegend, clone DX5), CD90.2 (BioLegend, clone 53–2.1), Ly6G (BioLegend, clone 
1A8), NK1.1 (BioLegend, clone PK136) and Ter119 (BioLegend, clone TER-119). 
Secondary staining of leukocyte subsets was performed using CD11b (BioLegend, clone 
M1/70), CD11c (BioLegend, clone N418), CD45.2 (BioLegend, clone 104), F4/80 
(Biolegend, clone BM8) and/or Ly6C (BioLegend, clone HK1.4 or BD Bioscience, clone 
AL-21). Neutrophils were identified as (B220/CD49b/CD90.2/Ly6G/NK1.1/Ter119)high 
(CD45.2/CD11b)high. Monocytes were identified as (B220/CD49b/CD90.2/Ly6G/NK1.1/
Ter119)low (CD45.2/CD11b)high and sub-classified as pro-inflammatory monocytes 
F4/80lowLy6Chigh or macrophages F4/80highLy6Clow/int. Flow cytometry was performed on 
an LSRII (BD Biosciences) and analyzed with FlowJo software (Tree Star). Single cells 
from specific populations were collected for subsequent bimolecular analysis by FACS-
sorting using a FACSAria II cell sorter (BD Biosystems). Single cell RNA-Seq samples were 
stained with Hoechst to exclude dead cells. Noninfarcted samples were unsorted. Infarcted 
samples were sorted for CD45+ cells only.

Total RNA from infarct tissue was isolated from WT and Irf3−/− mice on day 4 after MI. 
RNA-Seq libraries were constructed from polyA-selected RNA using the NEBNext Ultra 
Directional RNA library prep kit (Illumina, New England Biolabs) and sequenced on an 
Illumina HiSeq2500 instrument, resulting in approximately 41 million reads per sample on 
average. Transcriptome mapping was performed with STAR version 2.3.040 using the 
Ensembl 67 release exon/splice-junction annotations. Approximately 70–80% of reads 
mapped uniquely. Read counts for individual genes were produced using the unstranded 
count feature in HTSeq v.0.6.041. Differential expression analysis was performed using the 
exactTest routine of the edgeR package42 after normalizing read counts and excluding genes 
with low counts (cpm < 1 for 3 or more samples)43. Differentially expressed genes were 
defined based on the criteria of >2-fold change in expression value and false discovery rates 
(FDR) < 0.05. Functional annotation was performed using QIAGEN’s Ingenuity Pathway 
Analysis (Supplementary Fig. 2a) (IPA, QIAGEN Redwood City, www.giagen.com/
ingenuity) and the DAVID tool (Supplementary Fig. 2b)44,45. Published studies implicating 
cytosolic DNA sensing as the primary immune stimulus14,16,25,26,46,47 were compared to the 
differentially expressed gene list determined by RNA-seq analysis of WT and IRF3−/− mice 
collected on day 4 after MI.
Microfluidic inDrop Single Cell RNA-Seq
Single cell RNA-Seq was performed by microfluidic inDrop encapsulation, barcoding, and 
library preparation, as previously described48,49. Paired end sequencing was performed on 
an Illumina Hiseq 2500 instrument. Low level analysis, including demultiplexing, mapping 
to a reference transcriptome (Ensembl Release 85 - GRCm38.p5), and eliminating redundant 
UMIs, was performed according to custom inDrops software (URL: https://github.com/
indrops/indrops) [accessed April, 2017]. Mitochondrial, ribosomal, and hemoglobin genes 
were depleted bioinformatically, and clustering, dimensional reduction, and visualization 
was performed using the Seurat v1.4 software package in R with the following 
customization50. We considered cells expressing at least 200 genes, scaled to a total of 
1×104 total molecules per cell, and log normalized the data. The gene space was limited to 
over-dispersed high variability genes. Linear dimensional reduction was performed with

 principal component analysis. Unsupervised clustering was performed according to the 
default Seurat implementation of a community detection approach. Marker gene sets and 
associated p values were determined by differential expression using the Seurat 
implementation of the LRT test based on zero-inflated data. Cell and cluster proximity were 
visualized by projecting onto a 2D space using tSNE. Clusters were visualized using 
heatmaps of genes x clustered single cells and violin plots depicting expression probability 
densities for each cluster. To determine single cell IRF3 scores, we summed the counts for 
the directly IRF3-dependent genes, Ifit1, Ifit2, and Ifit3.
Histology and Immunohistochemistry
After removing contaminating blood by retrograde perfusion of the hearts from the 
ventricular apex with 10 ml of ice-cold PBS, hearts were embedded in OCT (Sakura 
Finetek) and flash-frozen in a 2-methylbutane bath on dry ice. OCT-embedded hearts were 
cut into serial 6 μm thick short axis sections and stained with hematoxylin and eosin or 
Masson’s Trichrome (Sigma-Aldrich) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Sections 
were stained using the following primary antibodies to identify cell and biochemical 
features: neutrophils, monocytes, and macrophages (CD11b, M1/70, BD Biosciences); 
monocytes and macrophages (MOMA-2, MCA519G, AbD Serotec); and collagen 
deposition (Collagen I, ab32386, Abcam). Biotinylated anti-rat IgG (for MOMA-2) and anti-
rabbit IgG (for Collagen I) were used for as a secondary antibody for immunohistochemical 
staining. Slides were scanned by a digital slide scanner, NanoZoomer 2.0-RS in 40x high 
resolution mode (Hamamatsu, Japan) or imaged on an Olympus FV1000 or a Nikon 80i 
fluorescence microscope and processed with ImageJ software using the Fiji package. The 
area of positive staining was quantified using custom semi-automated image analysis 
routines and at least five high power fields were analyzed per section and per animal.
Cardiomyocyte DNA Labeling and Detection
Pregnant mice were injected with 50 μL of 10 mM EdU (Thremofisher) on days 12, 16, and 
20 post-conception. Hearts were perfused, sectioned, and fluorescently labeled for 
visualization with Alexa Fluor 647 azide using commercial copper-catalyzed covalent azide-
alkyne click chemistry according to the manufacturer’s protocol Sections were 
counterstained with Hoechst nuclear stain. Cardiomyocyte nuclei were confirmed to be EdU 
positive immediately after birth and at 10 weeks prior to MI. EdU-negativity of leukocytes 
from RBC lysed blood that was cytospin-deposited on a slide was confirmed in 10 week old 
adult mice.
Bone Marrow Derived Macrophage Stimulation with DNA
For in vitro stimulation with heart-derived EdU-labeled DNA, the above in utero EdU 
loading method was used to pre-label mouse heart DNA. Adult mouse hearts were harvested 
and perfused with cold PBS as above. DNA was extracted using a DNeasy kits (Qiagen) 
according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Isolated double stranded DNA was 
complexed with Lipofectamine LTX (ThermoFisher) at a 3:2 ratio of LTX (μL) to DNA (μg) 
for stimulation. Bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDM) were isolated from femurs of 
wild type mice and were allowed to differentiate in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal 
bovine serum supplemented with 10 ng/mL M-CSF (Peprotech) for 1 week. The resulting

 cells were stimulated with LTX alone (control) or LTX and DNA. After 24 hours, BMDM 
were lysed and RNA extracted into RLT buffer (Qiagen). RNA was isolated and quantitative 
RT-PCR performed as detailed above. In other experiments, BMDMs from cGAS−/−, 
STINGgt/gt, and IRF3−/− mice were stimulated with medium alone, 2’3’cGAMP (10 μg/ml) 
(InvivoGen), Poly(I:C) (500 ng/mL) (InvivoGen), or 5 μg of herring testis DNA (Sigma) 
with LTX in 2 mL per well of a 6 well plate. RNA was extracted and quantified by qPCR as 
above.
Protein Analysis Western Blot and ELISA
Heart tissue protein was extracted in RIPA lysis buffer (Pierce) supplemented with protease/
phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Cell Signaling). Total protein concentration was quantified 
using BCA assay (Pierce). Lysates were denatured and subjected to gel electrophoresis using 
NuPAGE Novex Gel system (Life Technologies) and blotted on nitrocellulose membrane 
using iBlot Gel Transfer system (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s 
instructions. Blotting was performed with rabbit anti-mouse total IRF3 (Cell Signaling, 
#4302, Clone D83B9, used at 1:1000 dilution) and Phospho-IRF3 (Ser396) (Cell Signaling, 
#4947, Clone 4D4G, used at 1:1000 dilution). Loading control was blotted with goat anti-
mouse GAPDH antibody (R&D Systems, P04406, used at 1:1000 dilution). Blots were 
visualized by labeling with HRP-coupled anti-rabbit and anti-goat secondary antibodies 
(Pierce, used at 1:5000) and incubating with chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) 
administered. Gels were developed on a Kodak automated developer and quantified using 
densitometry with ImageJ. Quantification of CXCL10 protein was performed using an 
ELISA kit (R&D Systems, MCX100) according to manufacturer recommendations.
Coronary Perfusion Analysis
To visualize the coronary anatomy, high molecular weight >10kDa FITC dextran (Sigma) 
was injected into the tail vein and the anterior wall of the left ventricular was visualized on 
an OV110 (Olympus) microscope through a widely separated median sternotomy. To assess 
reperfusion after coronary ligation, 10 μm diameter fluorescent microspheres (Life 
Technologies, FluoSpheres, F8831) were injected into the left ventricular apex immediately 
after coronary ligation to delineate the initial territory deprived of blood flow. At the time of 
harvest, fluorescent microspheres of a second non-spectrally overlapping wavelengths 
(488nm and 647nm) were injected into the left ventricular apex and 1 mm thick short axis 
sections of the heart were made using a heart slicer (Zivic). Heart sections were then imaged 
on an Olympus FV1000 laser scanning confocal microscopy. Territory containing only the 
second and not the first microspheres was interpreted as reperfused territory and was 
reported as the fraction of total infarct.
Ex Vivo and Intravital Microscopy
After mouse intubation and ventilation with 2% isoflurane, the beating heart was exposed by 
median sternotomy and the heart was stabilized using a 3D printed tissue imaging stabilizer 
and prospective cardiac gating routine51,52. DAPI and the double-stranded DNA-specific 
(dsDNA) fluorescent probes Quant-iT PicoGreen (Thermofisher) or SYTOX Orange Nucleic 
Acid Stain (Thermofisher) were prepared in PBS and administered topically or by 
intravenous tail vein injection to identify dsDNA in the myocardium after ischemic injury.

 PicoGreen was applied topically at 1:100 dilution in PBS to the infarcted area 20 minutes 
after permanent left coronary ligation. Sytox Orange was administered by intravenous 
injection after ischemia/reperfusion injury; the left coronary artery was ligated for 20 min 
and the ligation was then released. Sytox Orange was prepared at 1:50 dilution (2 μL stock 
in 100 μL PBS), injected immediately after reperfusion, and fluorescent probe uptake was 
imaged over time using two-photon microscopy. Fluorescence was quantified along line 
scans manually drawn orthogonal to the long axis of each myocyte at the level of the 
nucleus. Ex vivo imaging was performed by flushing the heart as detailed above, creating 
short axis cuts using a commercial heart slicer (Zivic). Imaging was performed using an 
Olympus FV1000MPE multi photon microscope with 750 nm excitation and two channel 
detection.
Echocardiography
Transthoracic echocardiography was performed on awake echo-probe conditioned mice 
before MI and on days 4 and 21 after MI in un-anesthetized mice using a Vivid E90 system 
(GE Healthcare) equipped with an L8–18i-D linear array transducer (15 MHz frequency). 
Parasternal short- and long-axis images were acquired at a depth of 10 mm using both M-
mode and 2D-mode imaging at 250 and 605 frames per second, respectively. Image analysis 
was performed off-line using EchoPAC PC software (GE Healthcare, version 113). End-
diastolic and end-systolic left ventricular internal diameters (LVIDd and LVIDs, 
respectively) were measured at the maximal and minimal diameters acquired from the 
parasternal short-axis images at a level selected for visualization of the papillary muscle. 
Fractional shortening (FS) was determined by calculating the change in left ventricular 
internal dimensions between end-diastole and end-systole normalized to end-diastolic 
dimension (LVIDd-LVIDs)/LVIDd.
Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
Cardiac MRI was performed on days 1, and 21 after coronary ligation. Cine images of the 
left ventricular short axis were obtained using a 7 Tesla horizontal bore Pharmascan 
(Bruker) and a custom-built mouse cardiac coil in birdcage design (Rapid Biomedical). 
Acquisition was ECG triggered and respiratory gated using a fast low angle shot sequence. 
The echo time was 2.7ms, and the flip angle was 30 degrees (60 degrees for delayed 
enhancement imaging after intravenous injection of Gd-DTPA for measurement of infarct 
size). Images were analyzed using Segment software (http://segment/heiberg.se). Infarct size 
was determined by summing the % myocardial mass enhanced by gadolinium on serial short 
axis sections quantified at end-diastole. Ejection fraction was determined by calculating the 
change in ventricular volume between end-diastole and end-systole normalized to end-
diastolic volume.
Statistics
Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism software. All data are represented 
as mean values +/− standard error of mean unless indicated otherwise. A statistical method 
was not used to predetermine sample size. For two-group comparisons, a 2-tailed Student’s 
t-test was applied if the D’Agostino-Pearson normality test was not rejected at 0.05 
significance; otherwise, a 2-tailed Mann-Whitney U test for nonparametric data was used.

 All analysis except sorted cells were unpaired. For sorted cell samples, paired analysis was 
used to compare subpopulations from each mouse. For survival studies, mice dying within 
24 hours of LAD ligation surgery (<10% in all genotypes studied) were pre-specified as 
purely technical failures and excluded from subsequent analysis per protocol. Statistical 
significance of Kaplan-Meier survival curves were assessed with a Mantel-Cox test. P values 
are indicated by P values less than 0.05 were considered significant and are indicated by 
asterisks as follows: *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001, ****p<0.0001.

 cardiomyocytes were labeled in utero by EdU, such that the resulting adult mice have non-
proliferative cardiomyocytes that retain EdU, whereas proliferative leukocytes dilute the 
EdU label. At 10 weeks of age, EdU labeled mice were subjected to MI; infarct tissue was 
harvested on day 4 and evaluated for EdU staining in the cytoplasm of infiltrating 
leukocytes. (h) EdU click-labeled to a fluorophore (purple) in autofluorescent 
cardiomyocytes (green) prior to MI (left) and in the borderzone of the infarcted heart, which 
contains EdU-positive debris (middle left). A magnified view (middle right) of the region 
indicated by the dashed box shows a cell (outlined with purple dots) with extranuclear EdU 
puncta (pink); the nucleus (outlined with white dots) is stained with a Hoechst nuclear stain 
(blue). EdU staining of a bone marrow derived macrophage after uptake of EdU-labeled 
cardiomyocyte DNA in vitro is shown for comparison (right).
