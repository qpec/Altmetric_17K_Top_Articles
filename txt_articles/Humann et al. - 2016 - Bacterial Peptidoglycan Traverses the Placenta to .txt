In Brief
Bioactivities of pathogen-associated
molecular patterns at the maternal/fetal
interface are poorly understood. Humann
et al. demonstrate that bacterial cell wall
traverses the placenta to activate TLR2,
induce transcription factor FoxG1, and
promote neuroproliferation in the fetal
brain. Cell wall exposure and increased
neuroproliferation are associated with
postnatal cognitive deficiencies.

SUMMARY
Maternal infection during pregnancy is associated
with adverse outcomes for the fetus, including post-
natal cognitive disorders. However, the underlying
mechanisms are obscure. We find that bacterial cell
wall peptidoglycan (CW), a universal PAMP for
TLR2, traverses the murine placenta into the devel-
oping fetal brain. In contrast to adults, CW-exposed
fetal brains did not show any signs of inflammation
or neuronal death. Instead, the neuronal transcrip-
tion factor FoxG1 was induced, and neuroprolifera-
tion leading to a 50% greater density of neurons in
the cortical plate was observed. Bacterial infection
of pregnant dams, followed by antibiotic treatment,
which releases CW, yielded the same result. Neuro-
proliferation required TLR2 and was recapitulated
in vitro with fetal neuronal precursor cells and
TLR2/6, but not TLR2/1, ligands. The fetal neuropro-
liferative response correlated with abnormal cogni-
tive behavior in CW-exposed pups following birth.
Thus, the bacterial CW-TLR2 signaling axis affects
fetal neurodevelopment and may underlie postnatal
cognitive disorders.
INTRODUCTION
Infection and inflammation during pregnancy have been associ-
ated with adverse outcomes, such as preterm birth, abortion,
and postnatal cognitive disorders (Lowe et al., 2008; Sørensen
et al., 2009; Canetta et al., 2014). Yet how microbial products
circulating in the maternal bloodstream affect fetal develop-
ment is poorly understood. The disruptive effects of inflamma-
tion would be substantial, as fetal organs undergo complex
waves of proliferation and apoptosis during gestation (Cou-
zin-Frankel, 2013; Roth and D’Sa, 2001). Microbial components
display pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) that
are recognized by the innate immune system and serve to
trigger inflammation. In Gram-positive bacteria, cell wall (CW)
is
a
complex
exopolymer
that
harbors
several
PAMPs
that potently activate inflammation when released into the
bloodstream during bacterial infection or when explosively
discharged during bacterial lysis by common antibiotics (Tuo-
manen et al., 1985a, 1985b). CW binds to innate immune
Toll-like receptors (TLRs), particularly TLR2, and initiates
signaling leading to inflammation by a well-recognized cascade
involving MyD88, NFkB, and cytokine secretion (Aliprantis
et al., 1999; Yoshimura et al., 1999). This signaling process un-
derlies the pathogenesis of bacterial meningitis where CW/
TLR2 ligation provokes a broad spectrum of acute signs and
symptoms of brain inflammation (Orihuela et al., 2006; Tuoma-
nen et al., 1985a, 1985b). In children and adults with pneumo-
coccal meningitis, neuronal death predominates (Braun et al.,
1999, 2001; Mitchell et al., 2004) and neuroproliferation is insuf-
ficient to repair brain injury, leaving survivors with devastating
permanent sequelae, such as paralysis, seizures, and memory
loss (Gerber et al., 2003; Hoffmann et al., 2007). The degree of
damage depends on the pathogen, with pneumococci consid-
ered the most severe (Schmidt et al., 2006).
TLR2 is abundant in the embryo (Okun et al., 2010), but little is
known of the outcome of activation of this cascade in the fetus. It
is unknown if TLR2 ligands, such as CW, cross the placenta.
Bacterial CW could be an important participant in microbial-
host signaling at the maternal-fetal interface, since CW circu-
lates in the maternal bloodstream not only during infection but
also from the microbiome in healthy mothers (Clarke et al.,
2010). There is an emerging awareness of complex communica-
tion ongoing between the microbiome and the brain (Collins
et al., 2012; Tracey, 2009) that modulates a variety of complex
human behaviors and patterning of neuronal circuitry (Collins
et al., 2012; Cryan and Dinan, 2012; Hsiao et al., 2013). Early neu-
rodevelopmental stress and autism spectrum disorders have
been linked to gut microbial dysbiosis (Hsiao et al., 2013).

 We sought to use concepts of the pathogenesis of bacterial
meningitis and CW-induced innate signaling to develop a model
to probe the impact of bacterial products on fetal brain develop-
ment. Since CW components traffic from blood across the blood-
brain barrier and induce neuroinflammation in the adult (Fillon
et al., 2006), we reasoned that such a model, when extended to
pregnant mice, could be used to test the ability of bacterial CW
to cross the placenta and inform the capacity of the fetal brain
to respond directly to bacterial PAMPs. This information would
be relevant togeneral questions concerning the developing brain,
such as the nature of the TLR2 response in the fetal brain and the
potential for microbial products to affect neurodevelopment.
Our data indicate that the placenta allows CW traffic from the
maternal to the fetal circulation. In contrast to neuronal death
seen in the postnatal scenario (Tuomanen et al., 1985a, 1985b;
Nau and Bru
¨ ck, 2002), engagement of TLR2 by CW in the fetus
results in robust FoxG1-dependent neuroproliferation. This in
utero response alters cerebral anatomy and appears to have
long-term postnatal behavioral consequences.
RESULTS
Interaction of CW with the Placenta
The peptidoglycan-teichoic acid complex of the CW of Strepto-
coccus pneumoniae was chosen as a prototype component of
Gram-positive bacteria that incites inflammation via the innate

FITC-labeled CW was administered intravenously
(i.v.) to E15 pregnant dams, and the placenta was
examined 24 hr later.
(A) FITC-CW pieces were visualized and enumer-
ated in placental tissue of WT and PAFr�/� dams
(p < 0.005) (green, CW; blue, nucleus). Each
symbol is representative of one section, and at
least two sections were imaged per embryo.
Embryos (n = at least 8) were analyzed from at
least two separate injections.
(B and C) TUNEL+ (B; p = 0.006) or caspase-3+ (C;
p = 0.003) cells were counted in placental tissue of
WT or TLR2�/� dams exposed i.v. to CW or PBS.
Each symbol is representative of one section, and
at least two sections were imaged per embryo.
Embryos (n R 5) were analyzed from at least two
separate injections. TLR2�/� values were not
statistically different from PBS (p = 0.31).
(D and E) E15 pregnant dams were injected with
either PBS (open circles) or CW (filled circles).
Embryos were monitored for 30 min immediately
following injection via pulse-wave Doppler ultra-
sound to determine umbilical vein velocity (UVV; D)
and fetal heart rate (FHR; E). For each treatment,
one embryo was monitored per injection. Graphs

(Yoshimura
et al., 1999) and whose bioactivities in
the brain have been well characterized
(Tuomanen et al., 1985a, 1985b; Fillon
et al., 2006; Orihuela et al., 2006). To investigate bioactivities of
CW in the placenta, this macromolecule was fractionated, puri-
fied free of protein adducts, labeled with FITC, and injected intra-
venously into pregnant dams on embryonic day (E)15. FITC-CW
was detected in placental tissue within 10 min of maternal
administration and accumulated by 24 hr (Figure 1A).
Bacterial components decorated with phosphorylcholine, a
modification present on most oral commensals and respiratory
pathogens, bind by molecular mimicry to the G-protein-coupled
platelet activating factor receptor (PAFr) (Cundell et al., 1995). In
the case of pneumococcus, phosphorylcholine covalently mod-
ifies the CW, and the interaction between CW and PAFr supports
uptake of both free CW and intact pneumococci into eukaryotic
cells and across cellular barriers (Fillon et al., 2006). PAFr is ex-
pressed extensively in the fetal brain and placenta (Figure S1A,
available online; Okun et al., 2010). When examined in PAFr�/�
mice, significantly fewer FITC-CW particles accumulated in
placental tissue (Figure 1A), indicating that this mechanism of
translocation across host boundaries by bacterial components
operates in the placenta. This was further supported in vitro by
robust association of CW with trophoblast cells contrasted by
a rare association of EA (ethanolamine) CW, where ethanolamine
was substituted for phosphorylcholine (Figure S1B).
Many organs undergo apoptosis upon postnatal exposure to
CW (Braun et al., 1999; Orihuela et al., 2006). In contrast, exam-
ination of the placenta after CW administration to wild-type (WT)

 mice showed only a modest increase in both TUNEL+ and cas-
pase-3+ cells (Figures 1B and 1C). In TLR2�/� mice, CW induc-
tion of death in the placenta was not significantly different from
PBS (Figures 1B, 1C, and S1C). CW caused no immediate fetal
distress, as measured by umbilical vein velocity and fetal heart
rate (Figures 1D and 1E). All CW- and PBS-treated embryos
were equally viable at birth and had similar weights at the time
of weaning (mean ± SD; 10.4 g ± 0.4 g and 9.8 g ± 0.3 g, CW
and PBS, respectively; n = 12 per group; p = 0.27). Thus, CW traf-
ficked to placental tissue via PAFr but did not induce strong
cell-death responses.
CW Enters the Developing Fetal Brain
In postnatal animal models, CW fragments in the bloodstream
distribute across the blood-brain barrier and induce signs and

To

occurred in the developing brain, CW
was administered intravenously to preg-
nant dams, and localization of CW was
examined in the embryonic cortex. CW in-
jected in a single dose at E10 or E15 was
detected in the fetal brain 24 hr later (Fig-
ure 2A). A cell wall density of �400 pieces/mm2 corresponds
to 4 3 105 pieces per entire cortical plate, indicating that �2%
of the inoculum into mother trafficked to the fetal brain. CW
administered daily from E10 to E14 was present in the cortex
at E16 at similar levels to that seen in a single E15 injection (Fig-
ure 2A). However, accumulation may be transient since a single
dose of CW injected at E10 was not visible in the brain at E16
(Figure 2A). EA CW that crosses the blood-brain barrier poorly
(lacks phosphorylcholine) was not detected in the fetal brain
(data not shown). TLR2�/� fetal brains showed equivalent accu-
mulation of CW as WT; in contrast, PAFr�/� fetal brains exhibited
significantly less CW accumulation (Figure 2B). In addition to the
cortex, pneumococcal CW was found in multiple regions of the
developing fetal brain, including the cerebellum, olfactory region,
thalamus, and choroid plexus (data not shown). Thus, CW readily

 enters the developing fetal brain in a PAFr-dependent manner
previously well-established in the postnatal brain (Cundell
et al., 1995).
CW-Induced Neuronal Fate Decisions in the Embryonic
Brain
Extensive neuronal cell death is evident in brains of humans with
meningitis and in postnatal mouse models using living bacteria
or intravenous CW components (Fillon et al., 2006; Nau and
Bru
¨ ck, 2002). In the animal models, intravenous challenge with
107 living pneumococci or 107 bacterial equivalents of CW in-
duces high levels of neuronal apoptosis by 24 hr (58 ± 6 and
54 ± 7 apoptotic cells/mm2, respectively; Figure 2C) (Orihuela
et al., 2006). However, exposure of the fetus to CW caused
only low-level TUNEL+ cell death compared to adult brains and
no significant increase in caspase-3+ staining (Figures 2C and
2D). No increase in cell death was seen in TLR2�/� and PAFr�/�
mice (Figure S2). Microglial activation, as indicated by the
marker Iba-1, was strong in adult brain post-CW while the fetus
showed a decrease in this inflammatory marker post-CW
(Figure 2E).
Rather than cell death, the response of the fetal brain to CW
revealed marked neuronal proliferation. In the cortex, the area
and cell density of the cortical plate were measured using stere-
ology with the Cavalieri estimator and the optical fractionator
probe (Figures 3A and 3B). For embryos exposed to CW at
E10 and analyzed at E16, the area of the cortical plate remained
stable (1.05 3 106 ± 0.16 versus 1.09 3 106 ± 0.14 mm2 PBS), but
a 50% increase in density of neurons was observed (Figures 3B
and 3C, left panel). This increased cell density was absent in
TLR2�/� or PAFr�/� mice (Figures 3B and 3C, left panel) or in em-
bryos challenged at E15 and harvested at E16 with WT CW.

 To extend this observation to a more clinically relevant sce-
nario, bloodstream infection with S. pneumoniae was estab-
lished in E9 pregnant dams followed by daily treatment until
E16 by ampicillin, known to potently release CW and contents
by lysis (Tuomanen et al., 1985a, 1985b). Embryos thus exposed
to CW debris showed a significant increase in density of cortical
plate neurons compared to ampicillin alone (Figure 3C, right
panel). Embryos exposed to maternal infection treated with clin-
damycin, a protein synthesis inhibitor that does not release CW,
showed no increase in cortical neuronal density (Figure 3C, right
panel).
New neurons originate deep in the cortical ventricular zone
and migrate out to the superficial cortical plate. To document
the effect of CW exposure on immature neurons (Yamaguchi
et al., 2000), pregnant Nestin-GFP transgenic dams were treated
with CW, and the Nestin-GFP signal in the fetal brain was visual-
ized via fluorescence microscopy. CW exposure strongly
enhanced the GFP signal in immature neurons of the ventricular
zone of the developing cortex (Figure 3D; quantitation shown in
Figure S3, p = 0.035). PAFr�/� embryos showed no proliferation,
consistent with the absence of CW entering the brain. Further-
more, expression of TLR2, the innate immune receptor for CW,
was required for neuronal proliferation, as TLR2-deficient em-
bryos did not show a significant increase in Nestin-GFP signal
post-CW exposure (Figure 3D).
To further confirm that CW exposure induced neuronal prolif-
eration in the developing brain, E15 pregnant FUCCI mice, which
express genetically encoded markers for the cell cycle transition
from G1 to S phase (Sakaue-Sawano et al., 2008), were chal-
lenged with CW, and dual color intensity of the fetal cortex was
analyzed 24 hr later (Figure 3E). The number of geminin-positive
dividing cells was significantly increased in the ventricular zone
of the fetal cortex post-CW exposure. Immunohistochemical
tracking of phosphohistone H3, a general marker of neuronal
proliferation, revealed that CW induced a highly significant
tripling of proliferating cells in the ventricular zone (Figure 3F;
mean ± SD. MFI 319% ± 50% over PBS baseline of 100% ±
62%; p = 0.0003). Taken together, results indicate that exposure
of embryos to CW from the maternal circulation induces neuro-
proliferation in the ventricular zone of the cortex that results in
an increased cell density in the cortical plate.
In Vitro Assay of CW-Induced Neuroproliferation
To examine the mechanism of the fetal cell response to CW,
neuronal precursor cells (NPCs) from fetal brain were harvested,
and proliferation after CW challenge in vitro was measured either
by direct counting by microscopy, by incorporation of BrdU, or
by loading with CFSE label followed by FACS to quantify dilution
of the CFSE signal as cells divided. Using the CSFE assay, CW
clearly induced a shift from bright to dim cells compared to
PBS treatment, indicating active cell division (Figure 4A), while
TLR2�/� and PAFr�/� NPCs failed to proliferate (Figure 4B).
Direct visual enumeration confirmed CFSE assay proliferation
(Figure S4A). Incorporation of BrdU as a proliferation marker
also clearly indicated WT cells proliferated strongly, while
PAFr�/� cells showed a low but detectable response and
TLR2�/� cells showed no response (Figure S4B). The degree of
proliferation correlated directly with the CW dose but was inde-
pendent of the timing of the NPC harvest between E12 and E14
(Figure S4C). Living pneumococci (deficient in the toxin pneumo-
lysin) treated with ampicillin, but not clindamycin, also induced
proliferation (Figure S4D). Staphylococcal peptidoglycan also
induced proliferation (ranging between 20% and 30% of cells
above PBS baseline), supporting the general relevance of cell
wall/TLR2 signaling. To determine if chemically distinct TLR2
agonists induced proliferation, TLR2/1 agonist Pam3Cys and
TLR2/6 agonist MALP2 were compared (Figures 4C and S4E).
Only Malp2 induced proliferation, indicating TLR2/6 hetero-
dimers were likely key to signaling.
The in vitro assay afforded the opportunity to eliminate the role
of PAFr in transport of CW across the blood-brain barrier and to
dissect the role of the pneumococcal teichoic acid component of
the CW in proliferation. A much stronger decrease in proliferation
in PAFr TLR2 double-knockout cells compared to single knock-
outs (Figure S4A) suggested a role for both receptors in signaling
proliferation. The attenuation of proliferation by EA CW or
PAFr�/� cells in vitro also suggested at least some role for
PAFr in proliferation (Figure S4E).
Consistent with in vivo findings, CW associated with the
neuronal surface and within cells in vitro (Figure 4D). Neurons
also produced significantly longer neurites in response to CW,
a response comparable to the positive control VEGF (vascular
endothelial growth factor) (Figure 4E). Stimulated NPCs showed
increased expression of p-AKT and PI3Kinase (Figure 4F). CW
failed to induce the glial activation marker Iba-1 or secretion of
inflammatory cytokines into the NPC supernatant fluid (Fig-
ure 4G). Thus CW failed to induce TLR2/1 inflammatory markers
or glial activation but induced mediators characteristic of the
alternative TLR2/6 pathway in neuronal cells.
Interactions between CW and FoxG1 Signaling
The neuronal nuclear transcription factor FoxG1 maintains pro-
genitor cells (Dastidar et al., 2011; Regad et al., 2007) and is
required for patterning of the telencephalon (He
´ bert and Fishell,
2008), neural cell transit through the cortex (Miyoshi and Fishell,
2012), and regulation of neural precursor proliferation (Marty-
noga et al., 2005). As these phenotypes were altered by CW,
we tested if FoxG1 participated in the effects of CW on neuronal
fate. When embryos were exposed to CW at E15, FoxG1 expres-
sion was strongly enhanced within 6 hr of CW exposure, espe-
cially in the cortical plate (Figure 5A). This response was
sustained for up to 24 hr and was similar in E10 embryos (data
not shown). In contrast, FoxG1 expression was significantly
muted in TLR2�/� or PAFr�/� embryos challenged with CW (Fig-
ure 5A). FoxG1 staining colocalized with the expression of
neuronal markers NeuN and tubulin b-III (Figures 5B and S5A).
Adjacent brain sections demonstrated strong induction of
expression of PI3kinase, a protein in the FoxG1 signaling
cascade (Figure S5B). Induction of FoxG1 required CW entry
into the brain since challenge with EA CW failed to induce
enhanced FoxG1 staining (Figure 5C). In vitro challenge of
NPCs indicated that induction of FoxG1 expression was depen-
dent on CW dose (Figure 5D). Taken together, these data
suggest that FoxG1, an important regulatory transcription factor
that has central significance in the development of the fetal cor-
tex, is strongly enhanced in the embryonic brain after CW expo-
sure. Furthermore, CW-induced signaling via TLR2 played a role
in the increased expression of FoxG1 in the fetal brain.

 Behavioral Consequences of Fetal Exposure to
Pneumococcal CW
In humans and postnatal mice, pneumococcal meningitis often
results in neuronal loss with subsequent impaired memory and
cognitive function (Grandgirard et al., 2007; Schmidt et al.,
2006; Tauber et al., 2009). In contrast, our data suggest that
within the fetal cortex, CW enhances proliferation of neurons,
leading to an increase in overall number of neurons in the cortical

increased proliferation affected postnatal
behavior as assessed by three assays of
spatial learning and working memory (Fig-
ure S6). In the spatial recognition format,
the time spent examining novel arms of
the maze was significantly less time for
pups exposed to CW at E10 (Figure 6A).
In the delayed nonmatched to position Y
maze test, pups were tested for working
memory sequentially over weeks postna-
tally (Figure 6B). Between 6–9 weeks of
age, the PBS-exposed mice improved
memory function as denoted by an in-

choices, while the CW-exposed mice
made significantly fewer novel choices
as they aged. These data suggest that
the increased neuronal density in the cortical plate after early
exposure to CW in utero (i.e., E10) was associated with a detri-
mental effect on the memory and cognitive function of postnatal
mice.
To determine if the timing of CW challenge during pregnancy
affected subsequent cognitive deficits, mothers were chal-
lenged with CW at E10 or E15. The pups were carried to term
and tested in the novel object recognition test of memory and

 anxiety at 3 months of age. E10-challenged pups demonstrated
significantly less exploration measured as total time, time with an
old object, or time with a new object (Figure 6C). E15-challenged
pups showed no differences from PBS controls. Thus, CW
challenge at E15 did not induce proliferation or subsequent
behavioral abnormalities.
DISCUSSION
The maternal-fetal environment shapes the development and
long-term function of the fetal brain, including the consequences
of exposure in utero to inflammatory or infectious stimuli. The
peptidoglycan-teichoic acid complex of bacterial CW is a potent
library of bioactive components that interacts with innate im-
mune receptors to generate inflammation during infection. In
the postnatal setting, CW engages PAFr to translocate across
endothelial barriers from blood into brain, a process that is
also operative at the placental and fetal blood-brain barrier.
Once in the brain in the postnatal setting, CW interacts with
TLR2,
engendering
an
intense
acute-phase
inflammatory
response recognized clinically as meningitis. Our data indicate
that the TLR2-dependent response to this PAMP in the fetus is
fundamentally distinct from the postnatal scenario. Inflammation
is strikingly absent in the fetal brain, and TLR2-dependent
neuronal death is dramatically mitigated. Furthermore, the devel-
oping fetal brain responds with neuroproliferation. CW trafficked
quickly from the maternal circulation to the fetal brain and then
appeared to be cleared over the course of several days. Within
24 hr of CW exposure, proliferation of new neurons was promi-
nent in the ventricular zone of the cortex. Exposure early in
gestation (E10) engendered proliferation sufficient to increase
neuronal density in the cortical plate at E16. This suggests that
immature neurons underwent proliferation in the ventricular
zone and then migrated to and accumulated in the cortical plate
over time. E15 challenge with E16 histopathology showed no in-
crease in cortical-plate neuronal density, suggesting either the
window for the effect closes late in gestation or the new neurons
did not have time to migrate to the cortex within 24 hr.
After injury to the postnatal brain, a repair response is limited.
Modulation of the brain repair response so as to improve neu-
rogenesis has been sought to improve the outcome of affected
patients.

 signaling via TLR2, decreasing signaling by TLR4 (Rolls et al.,
2007), or blockade of IL-6 (Monje et al., 2003). In contrast,
TLR2 signaling induced by synthetic ligands in the embryonic
brain (E15) has been shown to decrease neuronal proliferation
associated with enlarged cerebral ventricles (Okun et al.,
2010).
Our
data
indicate
that
a
strong
neurogenerative
response occurs in the early fetal brain upon challenge with
bacterial PAMPs recognized by TLR2, and this response in-
volves a previously unrecognized link between TLR2 and the
neuronal transcription factor FoxG1.
FoxG1 is a transcription factor required for development and
patterning of the telencephalon in the embryo (Danesin et al.,
2009; He
´ bert and Fishell, 2008; Manuel et al., 2010; Martynoga
et al., 2005) and has been referred to as a spatio-temporal hub
gene in the brain. Dysregulation of FoxG1 is associated with me-
dulloblastoma (Adesina et al., 2007), impaired neurogenesis
(Shen et al., 2006), and autism spectrum disorder (Mariani
et al., 2015). Recent studies have also implicated FoxG1 in pro-
moting survival in differentiated, postmitotic neurons (Dastidar
et al., 2011). Our data show that fetal CW exposure greatly
enhanced FoxG1 expression in both immature neurons of the
ventricular zone and particularly in postmitotic neurons in the
cortical plate. Neuroproliferation could arise by the known ability
of FoxG1 to antagonize the cytostatic signal of TGFb-FoxO-
Smad proteins (Chan et al., 2009; Seoane et al., 2004).
CW-induced neuroproliferation and enhanced FoxG1 expres-
sion were both dependent on TLR2. TLR2 is a heterodimer with
TLR1 or TLR6 (Fukao and Koyasu, 2003). CW/TLR2/1 is known
to induce inflammation via MyD88 activation of NFkb, but this
canonical pathway was not strongly activated in the fetus as evi-
denced by the striking lack of inflammation in the CW exposed
fetal brain and the absence of in vitro neuroproliferation in
response to the TLR2/1 agonist. More recently, it has been
shown that TLR2/6 downregulates inflammation and induces
cell proliferation by signaling via PI3 Kinase and p-AKT (Fukao
and Koyasu, 2003). Exposure of NPCs or fetal brains to CW
induced PI3 Kinase, p-AKT, and neuroproliferation. PI3 Kinase,
like FoxG1, antagonizes the cytostatic signal of TGFb-FoxO-
Smad proteins (Chan et al., 2009; Seoane et al., 2004). Thus,
FoxG1 and TLR2/6 signaling could converge on TGFb-FoxO-
Smad to alleviate cytostasis. It is also possible that there is an
as yet unknown direct link between TLR2 and FoxG1 given the
TLR2 dependence of the CW-induced increase in FoxG1
expression in vivo. It is possible that the fetal brain escapes
cell death and inflammation while inducing neuroproliferation
by TLR2/6-mediated signaling in contrast to the postnatal
TLR2/1 scenario.
Neuroproliferation, which occurs variably throughout life (van
Praag et al., 2002), is a necessary step toward brain repair.
The accumulation of neurons, however, may not assure appro-
priate integration into functioning neuronal circuitry (Scharfman
and Hen, 2007). For instance, Bax-deficient mice exhibit excess
neurons, leading to altered neuroanatomy and behavioral defi-
cits (Buss and Oppenheim, 2004; Kim et al., 2009). Our data indi-
cate a similar outcome in the setting of CW exposure in that
expansion of mature neurons in the cortical plate was associated
with abnormalities in learning and memory and social behavior
between 6 weeks and 5 months after birth. It has been shown
that the balance of pro- and anti-inflammatory signals present
during fetal development can have an effect on later cognitive
function (Fukao and Koyasu, 2003). While a specific mechanism
for cognitive and behavioral abnormalities as a result of fetal
exposure to CW is unknown, our data suggest that changes in
the balance of neuroproliferation and cell death in the developing
brain likely contribute to a final outcome of altered brain function
in mice exposed to CW in utero.
The similarity of the fetal neuroproliferative response between
the CW challenge model and the live infection model raises the
possibility that the use of bacteriolytic antibiotics during preg-
nancy may have significant untoward effects on embryogenesis.
On the other hand, there is a potential beneficial clinical rele-
vance in understanding the timing and mechanism by which
TLR2 drives neuroproliferation in the fetal brain to efforts to
improve brain repair.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Animals
WT C57BL/6 (The Jackson Laboratory), PAFr�/� (Radin et al., 2005), TLR2�/�
(Yoshimura et al., 1999), FUCCI (Sakaue-Sawano et al., 2008), and Nestin pro-
moter GFP-transgenic mice (Yamaguchi et al., 2000) were used in designated
experiments. Nestin-GFP mice were backcrossed >6 times with PAFr�/� and
TLR2�/� mice for use in neurogenesis experiments. All mice were maintained
in the St. Jude Animal Resource Center BSL 1 and 2 housing, and all experi-
ments were carried out in accordance with institutional guidelines and NIH
protocols. Timed pregnancies were determined by ultrasound.
Placental health was monitored by pulse-wave Doppler measurements were
obtained using a VEVO-770 high-resolution ultrasound system (VisualSonics)
equipped with a RMV-706 (40 MHz) transducer operating at a transmit
frequency of 30 MHz. Pulse-wave (PW) Doppler mode was then used to
determine flow within the target umbilical cord prior to treatment and at fixed
timepoints after intravenous administration of pneumococcal CW. For post-
processing of each dataset, maternal heart rate was determined from the
real-time ECG over a ten-beat period. Umbilical flow was similarly determined
over five cycles, and built-in calibrated software tools were used to determine
both fetal heart rate and umbilical vein blood flow velocity.
Behavioral Testing
Working memory of WT CW-treated mice was tested as previously described
using three assays (Bevins and Besheer, 2006; Crawley, 2007): novel object
recognition, spatial recognition, and delayed nonmatched to position tests.
For novel object recognition, mice underwent testing at 3 months of age as
previously described. Briefly, mice were acclimated to a clear field in a dimly
lit room for 5 min on day 1. On day 2, mice were presented with two of the
same object (red glass diamond) in the boxed field and allowed to explore
for 3 min. On day 3, one old object and one new object (white porcelain
rectangle) were placed in the field, and mice were allowed to explore for
2 min. Time spent at each object on days 2 and 3 was recorded by video.
Discrimination indices were determined by the equation (new object – old ob-
ject)/total time. For spatial recognition, a Y-maze test was conducted in a
three-arm maze made from white opaque polyvinyl plastic. The mice were
exposed to the start and open arms for 8 min. The novel arm was gated. After
1 hr, each mouse was exposed to all three arms for 5 min. Total exploration
time in each arm was noted. For delayed nonmatched to position, water-
deprived mice were exposed for 10 min to all three arms of the Y maze, the
open and novel arms containing chocolate milk. The following day, mice
were allowed access to the start arm and an open arm. Once the mouse
reached the open arm, it was returned to the start, and the gate for the novel
arm was lifted. A correct choice was made if the mouse initially entered the
novel arm. This test was repeated, randomly switching which arm was gated.
Pneumococcal CW Purification and Mouse Challenge
Highly purified CW was prepared as described previously from Streptococcus
pneumoniae unencapsulated strain R6 (Tuomanen et al., 1985a, 1985b) and
396

 tested endotoxin free by Limulus gel assay (Genscript). This method results in
multimeric peptidoglycan with attached teichoic acid that is free of protein ad-
ducts and lipid contaminants as determined by HPLC and mass spectrometry
of subcomponents (Garcia-Bustos et al., 1987). The same procedure was
used to purify EA CW from cultures grown in media, substituting ethanolamine
for choline, resulting in modification of the amino alcohol on the teichoic acid.
These preparations have been studied extensively as biologically active and
structurally defined TLR2 ligands (Yoshimura et al., 1999). Staphylococcal
peptidoglycan was purchased (Sigma). For mouse challenge, CW was sus-
pended in PBS, sonicated, and administered intravenously to pregnant
dams as 2 3 107 bacterial equivalents. For some experiments, CW was directly
labeled with 1 mg/ml FITC (fluorescein isothiocyanate; Sigma) in carbonate
buffer (pH 9.2) for 30 min at RT (room temperature) in the dark and washed
twice with PBS. Unless otherwise noted, dams were challenged at E10 and
fetal brains were harvested at E16.
For live maternal infection and antibiotic treatment, dams at E9 were given
3 3 106 CFU (colony-forming unit) S. pneumoniae strain TIGR4X pln� intratra-
cheally; pneumolysin-negative mutant was chosen to eliminate effects of the
toxin on the CW phenotype. The course of systemic infection was monitored
over 24 hr by Xenogen imaging, and blood titers were obtained to assure
consistent bacterial load (mean 5 3 105 CFU/ml). The dams were then treated
with either ampicillin (100 mg/kg PO [per os] every 12 hr) or clindamycin
(15 mg/kg PO every 12 hr) until E16 when embryos were harvested for analysis
of cortical morphology.
Histology
Fetal brains and placenta were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde (PFA) and then
rehydrated in 30% sucrose. Cryosections were cut to 20 mm and stained for his-
tology by Haematoxylin and Eosin (Sigma) or Vectastain ABC kit (Vector Labo-
ratories). Sections were treated with antibodies to FoxG1 (AbCam), TLR2
(Sigma), PAFr (Santa Cruz Biotech), phosphohistone H3 (Cell Signaling),
NeuN (Millipore), Iba1 (Abcam), Tubulin III (Millipore), and fluorescent second-
ary antibody (Invitrogen). Methyl green (Vector Laboratories), Alexa Fluor 568
(Invitrogen), or Prolong Gold with DAPI (Molecular Probes) were used as coun-
terstain. For TUNEL (Millipore) and Caspase-3 (Cell Signaling) positive cell
counts, the area of the cortex was measured and individual positive cells
were counted. Immunofluorescent sections were imaged using a Zeiss LSM
510 NLO Meta microscope equipped with HeNe, Argon/2, and Chameleon
lasers. Confocal images were analyzed using Zen 2008 software. Histology
sections for brightfield imaging were obtained with a Nikon E800 microscope.
Image analysis, including MFI determination, was done using ImageJ software.
Stereology
Calculations of cortical area and cell number per cortex were based on stan-
dard stereology methods using the Microbrightfield StereoInvestigator with
Cavalieri estimator and the optical fractionator probe, respectively (MBF Bio-
sciences). Briefly, closely matched paraffin-embedded sagittal sections (three
per embryo) of the right cortex were stained with cresyl violet, and the average
area and cell number were calculated per mouse. Measurements were per-
formed on five to seven animals in each experimental group.
In Vitro Analysis of Embryonic NPCs and Trophoblast Cells
Embryonic NPCs were cultured from WT, PAFr�/�, or TLR2�/� dams at E12,
E14, or E16 using NB27 medium (Life Technologies). Briefly, brains were di-
gested in 6 mg/mL papain (Sigma) for 30 min at 37�C. Tissue was washed twice
before sequential trituration in culture media. Dispersed cells were spun, resus-
pended at 53 105cells/mL, and plated on poly-D-lysine (Sigma)-coated plates.
For in vitro proliferation assays, cells were stained while in suspension using
CellTrace CFSE Proliferation kit according to manufacturer’s protocol (Molec-
ular Probes). One day after plating, cells were treated with CW at an MOI of 10.
After 48 hr, cells were gently harvested by cell scraper and analyzed by FACS
Canto II (Becton Dickinson). For challenge with lytic debris of living bacteria, the
pneumolysin-deficient mutant TIGR4 pln� was grown to 106 CFU/mL, treated
with 103 MIC of ampicillin or clindamycin for 20 min, and then applied to NPCs.
In some cases, JEG-3 choriocarcinoma cell line ATCC HTB-36 was substituted
to represent placental trophoblast cells.
Two assays were used to confirm the CSFE assay. Cell number was quan-
titated manually by counting in a hemocytometer. Proliferation was also
measured by incorporation of BrdU (EMD Millipore). NPCs were seeded in
96-well plates and treated with CW the next day. Three days later, BrdU was
added, and 24 hr later, the cells were fixed and analyzed according to the man-
ufacturer’s protocol.
To visualize CW interactions with neurons, NPCs were exposed to FITC-
labeled CW for 48 hr, fixed with 3% (v/v) PFA, and visualized by confocal mi-
croscopy. Extracellular CW was stained with anti-FITC goat sera (Invitrogen)
without permeabilization, followed by Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated chicken
anti-goat sera (Invitrogen). For identification of neuronal cells, cells were
stained with rabbit anti-NeuN sera (Abcam) in the presence of 0.2% (v/v)
saponin, followed by Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit sera
(Invitrogen).
To determine CW effects on outgrowth of neurites, NPCs were stimulated
with CW (MOI of 10), positive-control VEGF (5 nM), or PBS. After 24 hr post-
stimulation, cultures were fixed and immunolabeled with NeuroD1 antibody
and an Alexa 488 conjugated secondary antibody. Cultures were imaged
with a spinning disc confocal at 403, and length of individual neurites was
measured in Slidebook. Neurons with individually resolvable neurites longer
than cell body size were analyzed.
Protein expression in CW-treated NPCs was analyzed by western blot. Cells
were lysed 5 min on ice using NPer neuronal protein extraction buffer (Thermo
Scientific), gently scraped, and spun. Supernatant was harvested, and total
protein was quantitated. Undiluted supernatants were analyzed for cytokine
levels using mouse IL-6 and CXCL1/KC ELISA kits (R&D Systems) according
to manufacturer’s protocol.
Statistics
All statistics were done using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad). Two-tailed t tests
with Welch’s correction, Mann-Whitney, and two-way ANOVA tests were done
as noted.
