Abstract
In Europe, despite recent therapeutic advances, there are many deficiencies in the management of multiple sclerosis (MS). Diagnostic 
and monitoring measures, guidelines, development of new treatments and best practice care are often suboptimal. These shortcomings 
were discussed at two MS multi-stakeholder colloquia that were convened in Brussels, Belgium in May 2014 and May 2015, and 
gathered experts from a range of different specialities to identify the key issues and propose means of tackling them. After considering 
all the testimony and discussion, the organising committee drew up a list of 10 calls to action, which included: increase awareness 
and understanding in the EU about the burden of MS; obtain better insights into the direct and indirect cost burden of MS; (re)define 
treatment goals and clinical study endpoints; develop new tools to better capture the total clinical burden of MS; develop a protocol to 
standardise magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); develop biomarkers of treatment response prediction and disability progression; integrate 
drug licensing and cost-effectiveness decision-making processes; develop separate European Medicines Agency guidelines for evaluating 
follow-on products of non-biological complex drugs and biologicals; implement a set of evidence-based standards of care and incentives 
to support people with MS to remain physically and mentally active. Addressing these ambitious calls to action requires cooperation from 
various health bodies and governments and some will require additional funding, but they are achievable and worthwhile. They would help 
minimise disease impact and would reduce disease progression and the consequent burden on people with MS, their caregivers, and on 
health budgets. These calls to action set out a strategy for future MS management and should be acted upon with urgency.

Over the past two decades, advances in the availability of new 
treatments and understanding of the disease have significantly 
improved the prognosis for many people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS). 
Despite this, in Europe, various aspects of management, diagnosis and 
monitoring of MS, the availability of guidelines, the development of 
new treatments and the provision of best-practice care are frequently 
suboptimal. Full awareness of the disease and its total burden is often 
lacking and patients’ access to the most appropriate treatments is 
highly variable between different territories. Reasons for low adoption of 
innovations are complex and affected by cultural factors. In addition, the 
methods used to assess the disease and its progression have notable 
limitations, and the protocols for use of diagnostic techniques, such as 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are inconsistent between different 
treatment centres. To address these shortcomings, multi-stakeholder

Satellite Symposium Proceedings  Multiple Sclerosis  
EUROPEAN NEUROLOGICAL REVIEW
colloquia bring together healthcare professionals (HCPs), regulators, 
pharmacists, payers, economists and patient representatives. These 
gatherings of diverse disciplines enable valuable exchanges of views 
between sectors that infrequently interact. The colloquia were designed 
to initially identify and discuss the issues facing MS understanding 
and management in Europe and then to propose actions to address 
the issues identified. Based on this evidence, the scientific committee 
of the MS multi-stakeholder colloquia identified 10 key calls to action. 
Addressing all these calls will require cooperation and funding from 
governments, healthcare organisations and payers, and active support 
from HCPs and patient groups. Such worthwhile actions may ultimately 
eliminate disparities in MS care levels in different countries in Europe, 
they could reduce the burden on patients and caregivers burden and 
improve long-term outcomes.
1. Increase awareness and understanding in
the European community of the burden of
multiple sclerosis on patients and caregivers
In the general population, among legislators and some healthcare
providers, the extent of MS and its impact on younger populations is
not widely recognised or understood. This decreases understanding
of the scale of the problem and can restrict resources allocated to
managing the disease. Worldwide, there are 2–2.5 million people living
with MS, which is equivalent to 30 cases/100,000, including 600,000
in Europe with 1,000,000 associated caregivers and family members.1
The prevalence of MS is higher in developed countries and at higher
latitudes. Current data show that per 100,000 population, the rates
are: 140 in Europe, 108 in North America, 2.1 in sub-Saharan Africa
and 2.2 in Asia.2–4 The mean age of onset of MS is 30 years5 – a time
of maximum work productivity – resulting in years of lost earnings in
addition to extensive medical and care costs. PwMS can live with the
disease for many decades, necessitating long-term care and increasing 
dependence on others (Figure 1). 
In PwMS, moderate disability (Expanded Disability Status Scale [EDSS] score 
of 3),which is often reached in a few years, reduces health-related quality 
of life (HRQoL) to 0.56 (EQ5D-5L). This is a poorer quality of life (QoL) status 
than patients’ experience with chronic ischaemic heart disease or non-
insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.6,7 To help address some of these 
issues, various activities and initiatives of the European Multiple Sclerosis 
Platform (EMSP) are ongoing. These seek to improve public awareness 
of MS and increase understanding of the impact of MS for researchers 
and HCPs (Table 1).1,8–12
2. Obtain better insights into the direct and
indirect (patient and caregiver) cost burden of
multiple sclerosis
The economic impact of MS is high but the exact costs (both direct and 
indirect) are insufficiently studied; recent figures may be underestimates 
of the true impact of the disease. MS generally strikes in mid-life; data
from studies conducted during the last decade indicate that it has a
very high cost burden compared with other brain conditions such as
stroke, dementia, Parkinson’s disease and epilepsy (Figure 2)13 despite
having a lower prevalence than some other brain disorders (e.g. anxiety, 
migraine, addiction etc.). An MS International Federation (MSIF) review
estimated that in 15 countries worldwide, in 2010 the entire cost of
the disease was $41,335 (€33,136)/patient/year ($69,118 [€55,410] in
the US, equivalent to a total of $28 billion [€22.5 billion]).14 An earlier
international study in 2005 estimated the total cost in Europe to be
€12.5 billion ($16 billion). Of this, direct costs represented slightly more
than half of the total cost (€6.0 billion [$7.5 billion]); informal care was
estimated at €3.2 billion ($4 billion), and indirect costs due to morbidity
was €3.2 billion ($4 billion).15
A systematic review of 17 studies conducted in Europe and the US 
published between 2006 and 2012, found that the annual average cost 
of MS per patient was $41,133 (€33,971) (in terms of US Dollar Purchasing

Power Parity).16 Meanwhile, the total direct and indirect costs of MS in 
Europe have been estimated to be €31,000/patient/year (Figure 3). Such 
estimates are not always comparable or reliable; methods to measure 
cost of disease are well established but are not applied in all territories 
and regions. Definitive data on MS economic impact and burden in 
different territories across Europe are much needed to justify the 
allocation of greater resources for managing the disease.
3. Perform patient research to (re)define
treatment goals and clinical study endpoints
from a humanistic/patient perspective
Patient and physician perspectives in MS frequently do not coincide. For 
disease effects that decrease QoL, physicians tend to prioritise physical 
aspects, whereas patients prioritise mental and emotional aspects,
general health, relapses, disease progression and adverse events.17,18
This difference in attitude was emphasised by a web survey of 651
MS patients that revealed that treatment safety concerns (progressive
multifocal leukoencephalopathy [PML], liver failure and leukaemia)
were more important to them than reducing relapse rate.19

EUROPEAN NEUROLOGICAL REVIEW
In MS, therefore, further research is needed to identify what determines 
treatment success for the patient. It should also be recognised that the 
patient determines treatment success and satisfaction, rather than the 
physician. It would be advantageous to adopt this principle in the design 
of clinical trials in which endpoints should include more patient-reported 
outcomes such as fatigue levels, cognition, activities of daily living and 
QoL measures.20 These factors should be as important as relapse rate 
and disability progression in drug approval/licensing and in value-for-
money decision making by health authorities. QoL determination is 
a critical criterion in patient-reported MS treatment efficacy, but it is 
important to recognise that condition-specific measures do not capture 
comorbidities. To address this, a broad definition of QoL in MS as well as 
a generic EuroQol 5D test (EQ-5D) are needed. 
4. Develop new tools to better capture the
total clinical burden of multiple sclerosis
The measures used to determine the clinical burden of MS are not
standardised, not uniformly applied and many provide incomplete or
unsatisfactory assessments. The EDSS has been used for many years
to assess disability progression, but it has limitations including poor
inter- and intra-rater reliability and low sensitivity to small changes
in disability. EDSS is less useful for patients with severe disability at
baseline and captures only physical ability/mobility/motor skills.21
Various other assessment scales are available in MS, including the
Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC),22 the Multiple Sclerosis 
Impairment Scale (MSIS),23 the Family Assessment of Multiple Sclerosis
Trial Outcome Index (FAMS-TOI)24 and various others25 but these also
have limitations. 
Some neurologists argue that scales that better capture the less 
visible symptoms such as cognition, fatigue and bladder, bowel and 
sexual function should be routinely used in MS.26 For example, the Brief 
International Cognitive Assessment for MS27 could improve assessment 
of fatigue and cognition. The development of such improved tools and 
their universal adoption could provide more comprehensive disease 
assessment, clarify MS diagnosis and enable better determination of 
treatment efficacy.
5. Develop a protocol for standardisation
of magnetic resonance imaging in multiple
sclerosis to optimise its use as a marker of
disability progression in clinical research and
daily clinical practice
Currently, markers of disease progression in PwMS are limited in number
and few provide any reliable prediction of likely disease course. MRI is the
most widely used and reliable marker used in MS and provides valuable
information on pathology, diagnosis, prognosis and monitoring. Some MRI
techniques can help predict future progression and treatment response.
For example, future relapse risk increases with the initial number of T2
and contrast-enhanced lesions,28,29 and number and topography of lesions 
predicts long-term disability.30,31 Clinical observation of MS signs often
fails to capture the extent of disease activity. Indeed, sub-clinical disease
activity as detected by MRI, can be substantially greater than that indicated 
by clinical assessment of relapse.32 In addition, MRI can capture some
aspects of the neurodegenerative component of the disease, such as
T1 hipointense lesions (a marker of focal irreversible tissue damage) and
brain volume loss (a marker of brain atrophy). Significant associations have 
been reported between baseline T1 lesion count, 10-year T1 hypointense
lesion volume and EDSS progression,33 and measures of overall brain
atrophy predict disability and disability progression.34-36
Whilst MRI assesses many valuable markers of MS status, pathophysiology 
and likely progression, the protocols used vary substantially between 
different treatment centres and territories. In addition, access to MRI 
equipment, particularly the latest instruments, is inconsistent across 
Europe. Consequently, many patients receive delayed or incorrect 
diagnosis, insufficient disease monitoring and suboptimal treatment. 
The lack of consistent protocols is emphasised by the variability in the 
methods used for measuring whole brain atrophy, the most robust MRI 
method to quantify the extent of brain tissue loss or damage, and in the 
varied capabilities of different centres to provide this measure. 
There is, therefore, a pressing need for robust and standardised 
acquisition/interpretation MRI methodology in MS that could include 
decision tree algorithms. Furthermore, there is a need for accreditation 
of centres and radiologists to help ensure best MRI practice is provided 
across all European territories.
6. Support research to find other biomarkers
to predict and monitor individual treatment
response with regard to long-term disability
progression
Other than MRI, there are few proven biomarkers for use in MS
diagnosis, monitoring or treatment response.37 There is a substantial
unmet medical need for reliable biomarkers in MS that could be
used in clinics and physicians’ offices. Such biomarkers would be a
valuable addition to clinical examination/symptoms and could increase 
confidence and speed in MS diagnosis and hasten the initiation of
appropriate treatments.

Several biomarkers show promise in MS diagnosis/monitoring (Table 2), 
these include several in CSF: neurofilament heavy and light chains,38–41 
immunoglobulin G (IgG) oligoclonal bands (OCBs),42,43 IgG index,44 and 
immunoglobulin M OCBs.45–49 Biomarkers in blood include an HLA-
DRB1*1501 polymorphism50 and low vitamin D levels.43,51 Other biomarkers 
that inform treatment selection in MS include: neutralising antibodies 
(stimulated in response to interferon beta [IFNβ]),52 anti-John Cunningham 
virus (JCV) antibodies,53 L-selectin (CD62L) CD4+ T cells (natalizumab)54 and 
possibly serum interleukin-21 (in response to alemtuzumab).55,56 Further 
research is needed in the quest for new and better MS biomarkers and in 
the validation of existing candidate biomarkers.37
7. Integrate committee for medicinal products
for human use and health technology
assessment decision-making processes
The process of making new treatments available for regular clinical use
first involves licensing by the Committee for Medicinal Products for
Human Use (CHMP) within the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and,
second, involves agreement to use or fund them in particular markets
by health technology assessments (HTAs), but these are disparate
processes. The CHMP/EMA concentrate on efficacy and safety (and,
more recently, on novelty). The HTAs are performed by national bodies
such as the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE),
Haute Autorité de Santé (HAS) in France and the German Institute for
Quality and Efficiency in Health Care (IQWiG) or payers such as insurance 
companies and pharmacies, and they emphasise value for money/cost
effectiveness/affordability.57 The HTAs have different remits and priorities 
for reimbursement57,58 and the lack of coordination between CHMP
and HTAs results in widespread inequalities in access to MS treatment
in different European territories (as shown by the MS Barometer and
other studies,8,59 (Figure 4). For example, fampridine received only
conditional approval for improving mobility in MS because the CHMP
was not convinced by patient-reported outcome data and demanded
more studies. CHMP and HTAs have different objectives, so merging the
two assessments would be difficult but adaptation or alignment of the
functions may be possible. The function of HTAs is unclear/unknown to
most patients; these bodies mostly comprise HCPs and payers. More
patient involvement is needed in these authorities/committees to better
reflect their perspectives and priorities.
8. Develop separate European Medicines
Agency guidelines for evaluating follow-on
products of non-biological complex drugs
As the patents of several older disease-modifying therapies (DMTs)
are expiring, this opens the door to generic biosimilars and follow-on
products. These have the potential to reduce the costs of MS treatment. 
Biologicals such as interferons or monoclonals can be produced as
biosimilars; these are similar to the original and can be characterised.
However, the non-biological complex drugs (NBCDs) such as glatiramer 
acetate (GA) cannot be precisely characterised or reproduce the
composition of the original product. 
An example of a biosimilar IFNβ-1a intramuscular product is Biferonex® 
(BioPartners GmbH, Reutlingen, Germany). Whilst similar to the original 
product (Avonex®, Biogen, Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States), this 
biosimilar showed lower clinical efficacy due to differences in production 
methods.59 A clinical study showed that the number of relapses over 
24 months (primary endpoint) with Biferonex was not significantly 
different to that of placebo. The follow-on NBCD products, Probioglat® 
(Probiomed, Ciudad de México, Mexico), Escadra® (Raffo, Munro, Buenos 
Aires), and glatiramer (Natco) have differing molecular characteristics 
and polypeptide compositions to the original GA product (Copaxone®, 
Teva Neuroscience, Petah Tikva, Israel). These follow-on compounds 
upregulate different genes (e.g. CD14 expression) and have different in 
vitro inflammatory properties to Copaxone and their clinical and biological 
properties may also be different.61,62
The development of complex drugs is further complicated by the 
differences in approval policies for these products in Europe versus the 
US. In the US, several complex drugs including GA have been approved 
based on data for the original product. In Europe, biosimilar products 
have been licensed, but clinical experience is required to support 
their use. There is a generally favourable approach from regulatory 
bodies towards generic follow-on drugs, but there are concerns as to 
whether they have the same properties as the original drug.62–65 The 
EMA has a process for biosimilar approval and this is adapted for 
NBCDs. Regulatory guidance for approval of these products, however, 
is evolving and may need further development as increasing numbers 
of generic drugs are emerging.63,66–69
9. Stimulate implementation of evidence-
based standards of care, with audit tools and
incentives to support people with multiple
sclerosis to remain physically and mentally
active and at work
For the patient, MS is a journey during which their abilities, QoL and
capacity to work are likely to decline. Studies of European populations
have found that that 50% of patients with EDSS 3 and 80% of patients
with EDSS 6 are unemployed or on long-term sick leave.6,70 To minimise 
disease impact, it is vital to establish and maintain centres of
excellence, with a multidisciplinary care team to provide an integrated
care pathway that contains evidence-based standards of care and
well-defined healthcare objectives. These will help address all aspects
of the disease and the challenges patients face. 
Good patient management should involve patient activation (involvement 
in healthcare) and rehabilitation strategies to maintain health and QoL.71,72 
These measures can help PwMS stay in work and reduce the disease and 
economic burden. Such services, however, are not available to all and

few know about them: a UK National Audit of PwMS (2011) found that 
only 43% of patients knew they had access to rehabilitation services.73 
It is therefore necessary to rethink the relationship between PwMS and 
HCPs and the architecture of the health service. 
Ideally, PwMS and HCPs would be considered as partners in MS 
management. Since PwMS and their physicians have limited regular 
contact, new technology should be adopted to remotely monitor 
signs and enable a rapid response to any change. Treating MS requires 
the cooperation of several different medical and support functions; 
coordinated multidisciplinary management74 of PwMS should be normal 
practice and should follow established evidence-based guidelines.
10. Support continuation of multi-stakeholder
colloquia
Interaction between stakeholders, including diverse professionals,
patients and caregivers involved in MS management and its provision
is valuable but rare. Most meetings in MS are confined to specific skill
sets, notably neurologists, and involve few other specialities involved in 
the delivery of therapy to PwMS, nor do they include patients and their
caregivers. Multi-stakeholder colloquia enable all involved in MS to gain 
insights and pass knowledge and experiences beyond the confines of
their usual speciality or location. These meetings are uniquely placed
to determine current opinions in MS management and aim to stimulate 
action to put pressure on governments and healthcare authorities 
to amend practices and policies that currently hinder best practice. 
The multi-stakeholder colloquia should therefore continue as long as 
PwMS across Europe do not have equal access to optimal treatments 
or receive adequate support measures to help manage their disease.
Conclusions
The calls to action discussed above are ambitious; addressing them will 
require active involvement and support from key stakeholders including 
governments and healthcare organisations. Some calls will require 
allocation of significant additional funding for provision of treatments or 
research programmes. Some of the calls urge prompt adoption of best 
practice but agreement on standard protocols will require cooperation 
of medical organisations across regions. This may be challenging but 
appears achievable. Improving awareness of MS and its burden also 
seems achievable given cooperation between different stakeholders.
Addressing the calls will likely improve the situation of many PwMS 
 
and help retard disease progression, reduce their burden on caregivers 
and maintain them in employment for longer. This could provide 
greater economic benefits than taking no action and incurring ever-
greater care costs as patients become increasingly disabled. These 
calls are critical to the future strategy of reducing the general burden of 
MS across Europe and should be acted upon with urgency. ■
