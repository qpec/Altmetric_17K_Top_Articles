HIV-1 infection is a major health threat in both developed and developing countries. The
integration of mobile health approaches and bioengineered catalytic motors can allow the
development of sensitive and portable technologies for HIV-1 management. Here, we report a
platform that integrates cellphone-based optical sensing, loop-mediated isothermal DNA
amplification and micromotor motion for molecular detection of HIV-1. The presence of HIV-1
RNA in a sample results in the formation of large-sized amplicons that reduce the motion of
motors. The change in the motors motion can be accurately measured using a cellphone
system as the biomarker for target nucleic acid detection. The presented platform allows the
qualitative detection of HIV-1 (n = 54) with 99.1% specificity and 94.6% sensitivity at a
clinically relevant threshold value of 1000 virus particles/ml. The cellphone system has the
potential to enable the development of rapid and low-cost diagnostics for viruses and other
infectious diseases.

he timely management of infectious diseases especially in
the developing countries where there are limited laboratory
infrastructure and trained staff is a major global health-
care challenge1–3. Diagnostic platforms that meet the World
Health Organization’s ASSURED criteria (Affordable, Sensitive,
Specific, User friendly, Rapid, Equipment-free, and Delivered)
with the ability to be seamlessly integrated with appropriate and
effective surveillance mechanisms can shift the paradigm in
outbreak control and the prevention of new epidemics3–5. Of
particular interest is early human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
detection, timely initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART), and
monitoring ART for efficient management of HIV infection
particularly in resource-poor settings where >70% of the infected
individuals live6.
The rapid advances in consumer electronics and portable
communication systems particularly cellphones have led to faster
and cheaper approaches of data acquisition and significant
growth of cellphone subscribers worldwide particularly in the
developing countries7–10. The global cellphone adoption and
cellphone adoption in just Africa has jumped to almost 4.8 billion
and 0.5 billion, respectively in 2016 and will reach to 5.7 billion
and 0.725 billion by 2020, respectively8–10. Such significant cell-
phone adoption particularly in resource-poor settings combined
with its powerful computing ability and built-in sensors present a
promising potential in developing mobile health (mhealth) tools
and surveillance diagnostics that can help us in closing the gap in
infectious disease management through providing appropriate
diagnostic solutions11–13. The advances in telecommunications
combined with the recent changes in consumer behavior on
wearable sensors and self-testing have led to the development of a
series of mhealth diagnostic and surveillance technologies for
disease detection and infection management14–21.
Recent progress in material synthesis and engineering can
allow seamless integration with cellphone systems to develop
advanced digital health tools and technologies. Self-propelling
nanoparticles (NPs)/microparticles are among the most exciting
materials that possess unique properties and have a tremendous
potential for disease diagnosis and treatment monitoring22–24.
These materials are readily synthesized in different shapes (e.g.,
spherical, rod, wire, tube, and polymer aggregates) and catalytic,
magnetic, and acoustic forces can power their motion. Catalyti-
cally powered motors are usually designed to harness specific
catalytic reactions either through using enzymes or transition
metals, such as platinum, silver, gold, copper, nickel, and iron.
Simple integration with portable devices and stability over time
especially compared to fluorescent-based sensing (i.e., resistant to
photobleaching, temperature, and pH)25–27 are some of the
advantages of catalytic motion-based sensing approaches. Fur-
thermore, motion-based optical sensing does not require bulky
optical components or expensive equipment usually used for
fluorescent-based microscopy. It can also allow rapid testing
compared to the conventional nucleic acid detection methods,
such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA)25,27,28. So far, catalytic motor
systems have been reported for DNA and protein sensing and
diagnosis of different pathogens and diseases29–38.
Here, we present a cellphone-based assay for HIV-1 molecular
detection using loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP)
and micromotors (CALM). The large stem-looped amplicons
formed through LAMP amplification are uniquely adopted to
change the motion of specifically DNA-engineered micromotors
powered by metal NPs (i.e., platinum nanoparticles (PtNPs) and
gold nanoparticles (AuNPs)) indicating the presence of the HIV-
1 using the cellphone system (Fig. 1). The efficiency of the CALM
system in qualitative detection of HIV-1 is evaluated using
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and serum samples (n = 54)
spiked with different concentrations of HIV-1 above and below a
clinically relevant threshold value of 1000 virus particles/ml. The
cellphone system is also tested using HIV-infected patient plasma
samples (n = 6) by comparing the results of the motor-based
sensing with the results obtained by a quantitative real-time PCR
assay targeting a highly conserved region of integrase in the HIV-
1 pol gene with single-copy sensitivity (iSCA).
Results
Platinum motor preparation and characterization. The micro-
motors used in this study are PtNP-coated spherical polystyrene
(PS) beads (with density of 1.04 g/cm³) indirectly engineered with
short DNA probes through a middle piece of spherical AuNP
(Fig. 2a). A detailed schematic for synthesis of Pt-motors is
shown in Supplementary Fig. 1. The motor preparation reaction
includes the direct coupling of AuNPs and PtNPs to the surface of
amine-functionalized PS beads using a heterobifunctional cross-
linker of succinimidyl 3-(2-pyridyldithio)propionate (SPDP). The
beads were initially activated with SPDP-forming thiolated beads
to allow the thiol–metal-based coupling with NPs (i.e., PtNPs and
AuNPs). Prior to coupling reaction, AuNPs were modified with
thiolated DNA probes of 30-mer oligonucleotides that specifically
target HIV-1 gag. The prepared AuNP-DNA conjugates were
mixed with the SPDP-activated beads with a molar ratio of 1:10 to
minimize the number of DNA probes on the surface of beads.
The remaining surface of PS beads was coated by adding excess
amount of PtNPs (Fig. 2a).
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of the synthesized
NPs showed that both the synthesized AuNPs and PtNPs were
spherical in shape with diameters of 57.721 ± 5.181 nm (data
reported as mean ± standard deviation) and 3.43 ± 1.336 nm,
respectively (Fig. 2b). Digital images and ultraviolet–visible (UV-
vis) spectroscopic analysis results for AuNPs and PtNPs are
shown in Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. 2. In addition, dynamic
light scattering (DLS) analysis results confirmed the stability of
the prepared AuNPs and PtNPs with polydispersity index values
<0.45 (Supplementary Fig. 3, 4) and zeta potential values of −14
to −29 mV (Supplementary Fig. 5, 6). The conjugation of DNA to
AuNPs was confirmed using UV-vis spectroscopy and Fourier-
transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) techniques. Figure 2d
shows the FT-IR spectra of non-modified prepared AuNPs and
AuNPs conjugated with DNA probes. The addition of DNA
resulted into a group of peaks around 515.01, 852.56, 1004.0,
1300.0, 1518.8, 1718.6, and 2061.9/cm that are specific for NH2
and pyridine of DNA nucleotides39. In addition, the number of
DNA capture probes per NP was quantified using UV-vis
spectroscopy (Fig. 2e and Supplementary Methods). The results
indicated that the average ratio of DNA/AuNPs was 12.1 ± 0.12
DNA probe molecule per each AuNP. The efficiency of
AuNP–DNA conjugates coupling to the surface of PS beads
was evaluated using silver staining technique. The presence of
DNA–AuNPs on the surface of beads induced a rapid change of
the silver staining reaction into a dense dark brown color
compared with control samples where non-modified PS beads
were added (no AuNPs) (Fig. 2f). The stability and reactivity of
the fully structured motors (PtNP/AuNP–DNA-modified PS)
were confirmed using inductive couple plasma–mass spectro-
scopy (ICP-MS) and gel electrophoresis techniques (Fig. 2g–i).
ICP-MS analysis showed that each PS bead is modified with an
average number of 1.335 ± 0.9161 and 386,044.1 ± 10.9161 of
AuNPs and PtNPs, respectively (Supplementary Methods). In
addition, the deposition of PtNPs with its characteristic intense
brown color on the surface of PS beads was easily observed as a
visible brown color when the prepared motor solution was
dropcasted on a sheet of chromatography paper, confirming the

 heavy surface modification of beads with PtNPs (Fig. 2g). On the
other hand, agarose gel electrophoresis technique was applied to
test the efficiency of the fully structured motors (PtNP/
AuNP–DNA-modified PS beads) in capturing synthetic target
DNA (Fig. 2h). Synthetic target DNA was mixed and allowed to
hybridize to DNA capture probes present on the surface of Pt-
motor. The hybridization reaction products of motors and target
DNA were then isolated by centrifugation, washed, and the
captured synthetic target DNA molecules were released by
incubation at 95 °C for 5 min The released target DNA was then
tested using agarose gel electrophoresis technique. The results
showed a clear band at 180 bp that is specific for the synthetic
target DNA captured and isolated using the prepared Pt-motors
(Fig. 2h). Furthermore, fluorescence spectroscopy indicated a 30%
capture efficiency of LAMP amplicons on the surface of motors
(Fig. 2i and Supplementary Methods).
Platinum motor motion testing and optimization. The velocity
of Pt-motors prepared from 6-μm beads was tested in the pre-
sence and absence of H2O2. Figure 3a shows the effect of the
concentration of H2O2 on the motion of 6-μm Pt-motors. In the
absence of H2O2, motors were just vibrating due to the Brownian
motion, and in the presence of H2O2, the average velocity of the
motors increased at a rate of ~0.7 μm/s for 1% increase of H2O2
concentration
(Supplementary
Fig.
7
and
Supplementary
Movie 1). Our sensing protocol relies on monitoring the change
in motor motion due to the LAMP amplicon reaction on the
surface of motors using DNA capture probes through thermal
hybridization. Thus it was necessary to test the effect of tem-
perature and incubation time in H2O2 on the velocity of the
prepared motors. We incubated aliquots of the prepared motors
at 45, 80, and 100 °C for 10 min. The results indicated that the
velocity of the prepared motors decreased with the increase in the
temperature and there was a 10% loss of motion at 45 °C when
compared to control (incubated at 25 °C as room temperature)
(Fig. 3b, Supplementary Fig. 8). On the other hand, the prepared
motors were stable in their motion with time of incubation in
H2O2. Figure 3c presents the motion of motors for 120 s in 5%
H2O2 solution. In the presence of H2O2, the motors autono-
mously move in a self-propelled fashion that is in principle due to
the consumption of H2O2 and generation of gas bubbles. To
investigate the motion of the prepared Pt-motors, their motion
trajectories in the presence and absence of H2O2 were recorded
under a bright-filed light microscope and then analyzed by
plotting the mean squared displacement (MSD) against time (t).
MSD is known to be proportional to tα for scaling exponent α40.
We found that the MSD versus time had a near linear dependence
(α = 0.9) when no H2O2 was added, as is the case for random
diffusion (α = 1), while in the presence of 5% H2O2 solution, α =
1.8 indicating that the motor motion is caused by the catalytic
activity of the surface PtNPs and differs from random diffusion
(Fig. 3d, e). To further confirm the catalytic nature of the

 Development of Pt-motor tracking cellphone system. The
cellphone system used in visualizing and tracking the motion of
micromotors comprises an android terminal (XT1575, Motorola)
modified with an optical attachment and a cellphone application
on a single-channel microfluidic device (Fig. 4a). The microchip
used to test the motion of motors was prepared of poly(methyl
methacrylate) (PMMA) substrate and a glass slide attached to
each other using a 80-μm double-sided adhesive (DSA) machined
with a laser cutter to fabricate a single microchannel with 2 mm
width (Supplementary Fig. 9). The cellphone attachment was
designed in Solidworks and three-dimensional (3D) printed with
low-cost polylactic acid (PLA) material. The 3D printed enclosure
housed a broadband white light-emitting diode (LED), a 3.3-V
battery, a switch, and inexpensive optical lenses. The 3D con-
struct also includes a sample holder to focus the sample between
the two lenses and the cellphone camera (Fig. 4b). The optical
attachment and sample holder were custom-designed to facilitate
chip insertion and positioning on the attachment through a
simple slide-on mechanism and in a way that the chip remains in
optimal focus without the need for manual focusing. The software
on the cellphone was developed in Android Studio using
OpenCV (ver. 3.1.0) libraries with a user-friendly interface to
guide the user through the testing process (Fig. 4c). The cellphone
application records videos of samples, enumerates motors, auto-
matically calculates the velocity of motors, and reports the results
in <1 min. The developed application was able to record sample
videos at a rate of 30 frames per second (fps) with a maximum
effective field of view of 320 × 240 pixels for the cellphone used in
this study (Motorola MotoX). The developed cellphone system
was first calibrated using a micrometer scale shown in Supple-
mentary Fig. 10. The performance of the developed system in
visualizing, counting, and tracking the motion of Pt-motors was
tested and correlated to the manual counts using bright-field
microscopy. The results indicated a correlation coefficient of
0.9413 with a standard error of 0.3592 and a correlation coeffi-
cient of 0.9028 with a standard error of 0.3121 for motor velocity
and enumeration, respectively. Furthermore, there was no sta-
tistical difference between the measurements (n = 50) from the
motion tracking application and the manual count performed by
bright-field microscopy (P > 0.05, paired t test) and with 95%
confidence interval (CI) of −0.1564 to 0.04814 and −0.1491 to
0.02913 for motor velocity and enumeration, respectively (Fig. 4d,
Supplementary Fig. 11 and Supplementary Table 1).
LAMP reaction and validation of the CALM system. Reverse
transcription-loop
mediated
isothermal
amplification
(RT-
LAMP) was performed using a set of four primers that target gag
gene of HIV-1 (Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 12) following the
standard protocol41,42. Different concentrations of HIV-1 RNA
template were prepared and used as a target in LAMP reaction.
The amplification product was characterized using agarose gel
electrophoresis (Fig. 5a). The results indicated the formation of
large-sized DNA amplicons appeared as ladder-like patterns with
many bands (>320 bp in size) and the amount of these amplicons
was proportional to the concentration of HIV-1 RNA.
To detect the motion of motors in the presence and absence of
HIV-1 LAMP amplicons, the motors were mixed with LAMP
amplicons and allowed to hybridize at 80 °C (Supplementary
Methods). The formed motor–LAMP DNA assemblies were
tested in 5% H2O2 solution. In the presence of HIV-1 LAMP
amplicons, the velocity of the motors (n = 30) was significantly
(P < 0.0001, unpaired t test) decreased by 95.26% compared to
control where no HIV-1 LAMP amplicons were added (only Pt-
motors) (Fig. 5b, Supplementary Fig. 13 and Supplementary
Movie 3, 4). Subsequently, different dilutions of the target LAMP
amplicons were allowed to hybridize with motors and the motion
of the formed motor–DNA amplicon assemblies was tested in 5%
H2O2 solution using the developed cellphone motion tracking
system (Fig. 5c and Supplementary Movies 5 to 8). The results
indicated that the presence of LAMP amplicons, even at a very
low concentration of 3.394 ± 0.245 ng/μl, reduced the velocity of
motors compared to control (no LAMP amplicons), considering
signal-to-noise ratio = 3. We further tested the recovery of motor
motion after releasing the target LAMP amplicons by incubating
the formed LAMP DNA–motor assemblies at 90 °C for 30 s. The
released amplicons were separated from the motors by centrifu-
gation at 6000 × g for 5 min and tested in 5% H2O2 solution.
There was a 75.52% recovery for the velocity of the tested motors
(Supplementary Fig. 14). In addition, the response of the CALM
system to non-target viruses was tested using different sexually
transmitted RNA and DNA viruses commonly exist with HIV
infection including hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis B virus
(HBV), herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), and human
papillomavirus type 16 (HPV-16)43. The results of LAMP
reaction confirmed that the DNA amplicons are only formed in
the presence of the target HIV-1 and no visible amplification was
observed with other tested viruses on agarose gel (Fig. 5d).
Furthermore, the average velocity of motors in the presence of the
amplification products of non-target viruses (i.e., LAMP reaction
products generated with HCV, HBV, and HSV-1) was not
significantly (P > 0.05, unpaired t test) different than control (no
amplicons) samples and was at least three-folds higher than the
average velocity of HIV-1 samples (Fig. 5e, f and Supplementary
Fig. 15, 16). To further confirm the specificity of our system in the
presence of the non-target amplicons or contamination, the
motors were challenged with non-target LAMP amplicons
generated from HPV-16 using specifically designed primers
against envelop (E)-1 gene (Supplementary Table 2) and at
amplification temperature of 60 °C for 30 min44. There was no
significant change (P > 0.05, unpaired t- test) in the velocity of
motors (n = 25) compared to control (no amplicons) in the
presence of non-target amplicons confirming the high specificity
of the developed CALM system for HIV-1 testing (Fig. 5e, f and
Supplementary Figs. 15, 16).

 detection using PBS (1× PBS, pH 7.4) and serum samples spiked
with HIV-1 and patient plasma samples (Fig. 6 and Table 2). The
developed system can qualitatively differentiate between samples
with viral loads below (i.e., negative sample) and above (i.e.,
positive sample) a clinically relevant threshold value of 1000
copies/ml as recommended by the World Health Organization
(WHO)45. To establish the motor velocity that corresponds to the
threshold virus concentration of 1000 particles/ml, the system was
first calibrated using 1× PBS samples (n = 48) spiked with dif-
ferent concentrations of stabilized synthetic HIV-1 RNA (0–107
copies/ml). The prepared samples were amplified using LAMP
and the generated amplicons were allowed to interact with motors
for target capture and detection using the CALM system. The
results demonstrated an average velocity of 0.705 ± 0.082 μm/s for
samples with 1000 copies/ml and there was a significant differ-
ence (P < 0.0001, unpaired t test) between the average velocity of
samples spiked with target RNA concentrations below and above
the threshold value of 1000 copies/ml (Fig. 6a, b). Accordingly,
the cellphone system was calibrated using this velocity value of
0.705 ± 0.082 μm/s to allow qualitative testing of PBS and serum
samples spiked with virus particles (n = 54) (Fig. 6c–f, Supple-
mentary Fig. 17 and Supplementary Movies 9–12). The qualita-
tive results obtained by the CALM system compared to the
standard quantitative real-time PCR (RT-PCR) technique are
presented as heatmap in Fig. 6c. In addition, the receiver oper-
ating characteristic analysis (n = 54) showed that the CALM

 system has a sensitivity of 94.6% with a CI of 81.8–99.3% and a
specificity of 99.1% with a CI of 80.5–100% at the threshold
concentration of 1000 particles/ml. The area under the curve
(AUC) was 0.984 with a binomial exact CI ranging from 0.905 to
1.00 and significance level P (area = 0.5) < 0.0001 (Fig. 6d). The
vertical scatter plot analysis showed that the accuracy of the
CALM system in correctly classifying PBS (n = 34) and serum
(n = 20) samples spiked with HIV as positive and negative were
100% and 90%, respectively (Fig. 6e). The specificity and relia-
bility of the developed CALM system was evaluated using serum
samples spiked with HIV-1 and non-target viruses of HCV, HBV,
and HSV-1. The results showed that the velocity of motors (n =
30) significantly (P < 0.01, unpaired t test) decreased in the pre-
sence of the HIV-1, while in the presence of non-target viruses
the velocity of motors was not statistically different (P > 0.05,
unpaired t test) than HIV-free control samples (Supplementary
Fig. 18, 19). In addition, we evaluated the performance of the
CALM system in identifying HIV-infected patient plasma sam-
ples compared to the results obtained by iSCA assay, which is a
quantitative real-time PCR assay with single-copy sensitivity
targeting a highly conserved region of integrase in the HIV-1 pol
gene widely used in clinical diagnosis of HIV infection and ART
monitoring (Table 2, Supplementary Fig. 20, 21 and Supple-
mentary Movies 13, 14)46. We observed 100% accordance
between the CALM system and iSCA assay in classifying patient
plasma samples as positive (≥1000 virus particles/ml) and nega-
tive (<1000 virus particles/ml).
Discussion
Early diagnosis of acute HIV infection is crucial since viral
replication and shedding occur in this stage before detectable HIV
antibodies appear47. Individuals with acute HIV infection who
are unaware of their disease can contribute to HIV transmission.
Most of the point-of care (POC) HIV diagnostics such as lateral
flow assays,
including
dipsticks or
enzyme immunoassays
(ELISA), and OraQuick HIV test kit target the detection of
antibodies against HIV and thus lack the capability to detect acute
HIV infection even at high viral load of HIV48,49. In addition, the
widespread implementation of ART has been highly effective in
reducing mortality in HIV-infected individuals but the number of
AIDS-related deaths is still >1.1 million every year. The recent
treat-all policy of the WHO recommends earlier ART initiation
regardless of CD4 count. Expanding access to ART in developing
countries has cumulatively averted 5.5 million HIV-related deaths
in low- and middle-income countries50,51. The updated guide-
lines will significantly increase the number of individuals eligible
for ART52. Nucleic acid testing (NAT) for HIV viral load
represents the most important method for the diagnosis of acute
HIV infection and ART failure monitoring, but current NAT-
based technologies cannot be implemented at the POC due to the
need for specialized laboratory facilities and technicians. The
limitations of current HIV viral load assays also represent barriers
for the monitoring and detection of treatment failure in resource-
limited settings. Thus there is an immediate need for an easy-to-
use, portable, and inexpensive diagnostic tool for detecting acute
HIV and early failure of ART. The presented cellphone-based
motion sensing platform allows HIV detection by uniquely
combining three technologies: (i) LAMP-based NA amplification,
(ii) simple optical signal generation using micromotors (PS beads
functionalized with AuNPs and PtNPs conjugated with anti-
bodies), and (iii) cellphone-based optical sensing. Such system
does not require bulky, expensive fluorescent-based optical
components usually used in other commercially available NAT-
based methods. This platform allows specific qualitative HIV
detection with a threshold of 1000 virus particles/ml and thus can
be implemented to detect acute infection and reduce the risk of
virus transmission in the window period and to detect early
treatment failure. We attribute the specificity and sensitivity of
the developed system to the nature of LAMP technique used in
nucleic acid amplification and the design of catalytic motors. We
optimized LAMP amplification conditions (increasing target
concentration and amplification reaction time) to amplify the
target nucleic acid down to 1000 virus particles/ml using a set of
four specific primers, which is directly contributing to the selec-
tivity and specificity for the detection of HIV-143,44. Engineering
the surface of Pt-motors with 30-mer DNA capture probe that
specifically recognize the target amplicon in a postamplification-
capture step limits the binding of any non-specific amplicons and
further improves the detection specificity and reliability. In
addition, the CALM system takes the advantage of the highly
efficient and rapid amplification of LAMP with a sensitivity limit
down to single copy of the target. Together with the unique large-
sized looped DNA amplicons characteristic to LAMP, the gen-
erated amplicons can effectively reduce the velocity of Pt-motors,
allowing a rapid and sensitive detection of HIV-1 RNA41,53.
In our system, Pt-motors were prepared using PS beads with
density of 1.1 g/cm3 to minimize the effect of gravity forces on
motors facilitating their use as a motion sensor. Compared to
bulk materials, NPs are known to possess higher surface-to-
volume ratio and thus higher surface activity54,55. For this reason,
PtNPs with average size <4 nm were used in the preparation of
the motors to allow efficient catalytic activity55,56. In addition, the
use of PtNPs allows better-controlled coverage ratio of the total
surface of beads using thiol–metal chemistry compared to the
commonly used metal sputtering technique that requires specific
equipment and tedious control procedures over beads during the
modification step. With ~4% surface coverage, the prepared Pt-
motors were moving with an average velocity of 4.96 ± 0.281 μm/s
in 10% H2O2 solution. Considering that our system relies on the
payload effect of LAMP amplicon to change the velocity of
motors, the control of the surface coverage of beads with PtNPs

 was critical to control the motor motion, allowing sensitive
detection of the amplicon. It is worth mentioning that controlling
the beads surface coverage with PtNPs helped to limit the accu-
mulation of O2 bubbles generated during the catalytic-based
motion of motors and allowed better imaging and motion
tracking using the cellphone. The use of AuNPs to indirectly
engineer motors with DNA capture probes allows efficient con-
trol on the number and position of the added DNA probes to the
surface of Pt-motors. The number of DNA capture probe was
optimized to be ~15 DNA molecules per motor particle to control
the loaded number of the target amplicons and in turn the
detection sensitivity of the developed system. Furthermore, this
strategy of indirect modification of the motors with DNA allows
spatial control over DNA probes to act as amplicon-binding spot
that induces the accumulation of amplicons in one side of the
motors to allow more directional and uniform motion of the
motors. This is critical to allow easy motion tracking by cellphone
and enhanced and reliable sensing performance of the developed
CALM system.
The presented work has demonstrated the development of a
cellphone-based technology for HIV-1 RNA detection based on
monitoring the change in the velocity of catalytic micromotors in
H2O2 solution when they interact with DNA amplicons. LAMP
technique allows target amplification under isothermal condition
and the used micromotors are simple in design and can easily be
prepared using commercially available PS beads and metal NPs.
The material cost of the hardware cellphone accessory, microchip,
and reagents per test is <$5 (Supplementary Table 3). We showed
that the developed system can rapidly (<1h) and qualitatively
classify HIV-infected samples based on a threshold of 1000
copies/ml with 90–100% accuracy as compared to RT-PCR. In
addition, this system is affordable, sensitive, specific, rapid, and
user-friendly, which are the major components of ASSURED
criteria. Thus it has significant advantages in addressing an unmet
clinical need in HIV detection and treatment monitoring and can
potentially prevent unintended infection transmission. However,
the presented system is a platform technology and will need
additional modifications to allow sample processing and ampli-
fication. Further testing using the standard laboratory-based
methods will be needed to confirm positive results generated by
the presented cellphone system before initiating any treatment.
The developed platform can be used in molecular assays that
require simple, low-cost, and rapid testing of viruses. The pro-
posed system has a great potential for broad applications in
infectious diseases control and management.
Methods
HIV-1 propagation and nucleic acid isolation. HIV-infected peripheral blood
monoclonal cells (PBMCs) were first isolated from patient blood samples using
Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient cell centrifugation. PBMCs were then stimulated
by phytohemagglutinin and co-cultured with irradiated PBMCs at 37 °C and 5% of
CO2. The virus titer in the co-culture supernatant was tested using HIV-1 p24
antigen ELISA (PerkinElmer Life Science, Inc., NEK050b). The co-culture process
was continued till the concentration of p24 became 20 ng/ml. The cell culture
supernatant was collected, and the virus concentration was tested using Roche-
COBAS AmpliPrep TaqMan HIV-1 v2.0 system at Brigham and Women’s Hos-
pital (BWH). For sample testing with the cellphone system, HIV-1 RNA was
isolated from each sample using the AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, CA,
USA) following the manufacturer's protocol.
Microchip fabrication. A single-channel microchip consists of three layers: (1)
PMMA (3.175 mm; McMaster-Carr Inc., 8560K239) that contains the inlets and
outlets of microchannels, (2) DSA sheet (80 μm; 3M Inc., 82603) that includes the
microfluidic channel, and (3) glass slide (25 ×75 mm2; Globe Scientific Inc.,
1358A). The microchip design was initially prepared using the vector graphics
editor CorelDraw X7 software. Then the DSA and PMMA were machined using
the VLS 2.30 CO2 Laser cutter (Universal Laser systems AZ). The DSA was used to
assemble PMMA and glass slide and the prepared chips were cleaned and tested for
leakage using de-ionized water.
Pt-motor preparation and characterization. Platinum micromotors were pre-
pared of spherical 6-μm PS beads coated with PtNPs and AuNPs and modified
with DNA capture probe that recognizes HIV-1 LAMP amplicons. The detailed
protocol includes three main steps: (1) PtNPs and AuNPs synthesis, (2) DNA
conjugation to AuNPs, and (3) PS beads surface activation and sequential coating
with NPs. The synthesis of PtNPs and AuNPs was performed following the
common protocol of metal salt reduction with sodium borohydride57–59. For
PtNPs synthesis, 100 ml of ultrapure water was heated in a 250-ml Erlenmeyer flask
and brought to boiling and 7.2 ml of a 0.2% chloroplatinic acid hexahydrate
solution was added and mixed by magnetic stirring. Then 2.2 ml of 1% sodium
citrate freshly prepared in 0.05% citric acid was injected in the flask and the
solution was mixed for 1 min. In all, 1.1 ml of 0.08% sodium borohydrate solution
freshly prepared in 1% sodium citrate–0.05% citric acid solution was added while
boiling and the reaction continued till the formation of the PtNPs. For AuNP
synthesis, a seed solution of ~15 nm-AuNPs was first prepared by adding 900 μl of
1% sodium citrate trihydrate solution to 300 μl of 1% HAuCl4 diluted in 30 ml of
H2O. The growth reaction of AuNPs was then initiated by adding 391 μl NP seed
solution to 100 μl of 1% (W/V) HAuCl4 diluted in 9.5 ml of H2O under rapid
stirring at room temperature followed by the addition of 22 μl of 1% sodium citrate
solution and 100 μl of 0.03 M hydroquinone. The reduction is completed within
10 min. One milliliter of the synthesized AuNPs was mixed with freshly reduced
thiolated-DNA probe deigned against HIV-1 gag gene (50 μM) and the mixture
was incubated at room temperature for 12 h. The solution was then brought to
0.1 M NaCl and allowed to stand for 40 h and washed twice by centrifugation at
12,000 × g for 30 min using 10 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.2)60. To prepare
thiolated beads, 0.14 pM amine-functionalized PS beads (Spherotech, Inc., AP-
60–10) were mixed with 1.6 mM SPDP crosslinker (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.,
21857) in phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) and incubated for 3 h at room temperature.
Then the thiolated beads were first coupled with the prepared DNA–AuNP con-
jugates using the well-known thiol–gold chemistry followed by adding excess of
PtNPs to coat the remaining surface of beads. The prepared Pt-motors were
characterized using TEM, UV-vis spectroscopy, FT-IR, Zeta potential (ζ), DLS, and
ICP-MS59.
LAMP reaction. RT-LAMP amplification of the target HIV-1 RNA was performed
using a set of four specific primers (Table 1). The reaction was performed as
follows: a mixture of the 4 sets of DNA primers (50 μM) was first prepared by
mixing 0.8 μl of FIP, 0.8 μl of BIP, 0.1 μl of F3, and 0.1 μl of B3 and then added to
the reaction mixture prepared of 2.5 μl isothermal amplification buffer (New
England Biolabs Inc., BO537S), 1.5 μl MgSO4 (100 mM), 1.4 μl dNTP (25 mM),
and 2.5 μl Betaine (5 M). Then 2–4 μl of the target and non-target RNA was added
followed by adding of 6 unit of AMV reverse transcription enzyme (New England
Biolabs Inc., M0277L) and 8-unit Bst. 2.0 DNA Polymerase (New England Biolabs
Inc., M0537L). The reaction volume was brought to 25 μl by UltraPure™ DNase/
RNase-Free Distilled Water (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., 10977023) and mixed
thoroughly before incubation for 40–50 min at 65 °C and termination at 85 °C for
5 min42.
LAMP amplicon capture and motion assay. Our assay relies on reducing the
motion of the Pt-motors when specifically coupled with the large-sized LAMP
amplicons. The prepared LAMP amplicons are hybridized with Pt-motor at 80 °C
for 2 min and cooled to 4 °C61. Then 10 μl of the formed assemblies were mixed
with H2O2 solution and loaded on the microchip. The reduction of the beads
motion in the presence of HIV-1 LAMP amplicons was tested using either the
developed cellphone system or the bright-field light microscopy (Carl Zeiss AG
Axio Observer D1) using Snagit v11.4.3 (Build 280) video recording software. The
recorded videos were analyzed using ImageJ and MtrackJ plug-in to manually
calculate the velocities of beads in the tested sample.
Motor tracking cellphone system. The cellphone attachment was designed using
the Solidworks 2015 software and 3D printed using Ultimaker Extended II 3D
printer and Ultimaker PLA as printing material. The cellphone attachment was
designed to record the videos using the cellphone rear camera of a Moto X
smartphone (Motorola, XT1575). The optical cellphone attachment has an LED,
electronics, and switches and two acrylic lenses extracted from TS-H492 discarded
optical drives with focal lengths of 4 and 27 mm and numerical apertures of 0.43
and 0.1662. The cellphone application was designed using Android Studio to record
a video of the sample for 30 s at 30 frames/s. The detection algorithm identifies the
motors and tracks its motion to calculate its average velocities. The presence of the
target virus is then determined based on the change in bead motion in the tested
sample.
Evaluation of the CALM system in HIV-1 detection. We evaluated the effect of
the presence of different concentrations of HIV-1 LAMP amplicons prepared by
diluting the final amplification product in PB (pH 7.2) into the following per-
centages 100, 50, 10, 1, 0.5, 0.1, 0.01, and 0.0%. The total DNA concentration in
each dilution was first measured using a NanoDrop One-C spectrophotometer
(Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.) and 10 μl of each concentration was mixed with Pt-
motors and tested using the CALM system. We evaluated the performance of the

 CALM system using HIV-1 and non-target viruses, including HCV, HBV, HSV-1,
and HPV-16. The cellphone system was calibrated with PBS samples spiked with
synthetic HIV-1 RNA standard (0–1 × 107 copies/ml) purchased from ATCC (VR-
3245SD) and then compared to the standard RT-PCR using 1× PBS (pH 7.4) and
serum samples spiked with HIV-1 particles at concentrations between 0 and 1.5 ×
104 virus particles/ml. In addition, the developed CALM system was tested using
HIV-infected patient serum samples (n = 4) and fresh whole blood from HIV-
negative subjects (n = 2) purchased from Research Blood Components Inc. HIV-1
plasma samples were prepared from whole blood obtained from patients enrolled
in the HIV-1 Eradication and Latency (HEAL) Cohort and ART treated and fol-
lowed up at BWH and Massachusetts General Hospital. This study was approved
by the Partners Human Research Committee. Participants of the HEAL cohort
represented a convenient sample of participants meeting the HEAL inclusion
criteria. Samples obtained were based on participant flow and no other sample
selection criterion was in place for the study. All patients (HIV positive and
negative) provided informed consent for blood samples to be collected.
Statistical analyses. Statistical analyses were performed using OriginPro 2015
(OriginLab Corporation, Northampton, USA), GraphPad Prism software version
5.01 (GraphPad Software, Inc. La Jolla, CA, USA), and MedCalc 14.8.1 (MedCalc
Software bvba, Ostend, Belgium). Correlation between the motion tracking cell-
phone application and the bright-field microscopy was performed using linear
regression analysis, and paired t test analysis was used to compare the motor
motion analyzed by both techniques. All data for system performance were ana-
lyzed using unpaired t test. Differences between groups were considered significant
when P values were not >0.05, and levels of significance were assigned as *P ≤ 0.05,
**P ≤ 0.01, ***P ≤ 0.001, and ****P < 0.0001. Each data point represents the average
of a total of three independent measurements.
Code availability. The computer code used for motion tracking in the developed
cellphone system reported in this study is available upon request from the authors.
