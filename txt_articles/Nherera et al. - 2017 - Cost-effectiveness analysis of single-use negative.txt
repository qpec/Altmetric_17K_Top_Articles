ABSTRACT
We sought to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of single-use negative pressure
wound therapy in patients undergoing primary hip and knee replacements using
effectiveness data from a recently completed non-blinded randomized controlled
trial. A decision analytic model was developed from UK National Health Service
perspective using data from a single-centre trial. 220 patients were randomized
to treatment with either single-use negative pressure wound therapy or standard
care i.e., film dressings of clinician choice and followed for 6 weeks. Outcomes
included dressing changes, length of stay, surgical site complications, cost and
quality adjusted life years. The randomized controlled trial reported a reduction
in dressing changes (p 5 0.002), SSC (p 5 0.06) and LOS (p 5 0.07) in favor of
single-use negative pressure wound therapy compared with standard care. The
model estimated 0.116 and 0.115 QALY gained, 0.98 and 0.92 complications
avoided for single-use negative pressure wound therapy and standard care,
respectively. The cost/patient was £5,602 ($7,954) and £6,713 ($9,559) for
single-use negative pressure wound therapy and standard care respectively
resulting in cost-saving of £1,132 ($1,607) in favor of single-use negative
pressure wound therapy. Greater savings were observed in subgroups of higher
risk patients with BMI � 35 and ASA � 3 i.e., £7,955 ($11,296) and £7,248
($10,293), respectively. The findings were robust to a range of sensitivity
analyses. In conclusion, single-use negative pressure wound therapy can be
considered a cost saving intervention to reduce surgical site complications
following primary hip and knee replacements compared with standard care.
Providers should consider targeting therapy to those patients at elevated risk of
surgical site complications to maximize efficiency.
Postoperative surgical site infection (SSI) is the most com-
mon post-operative complication, occurring in up to five
percent of all patients undergoing surgery.1 SSI occurs in
0.7% and 0.6% of patients undergoing orthopaedic surgery
i.e., in total hip arthroplasty (THA) and total knee arthro-
plasty (TKA), respectively,2 this information is limited to
in-hospital and readmissions for surgical site infection.
The true incidence of surgical site infection in the commu-
nity following discharge from the hospital is largely
unknown. We have a reasonable estimation of wound com-
plications based on the patient reported outcome measures
(PROMS) data published in the National Joint Registry
Report, however this information may be exaggerated for
two reasons, firstly the PROMS questionnaire return rate is
less than 40% and secondly those choosing to return
the PROMS questionnaire may be influenced to do so
as a result of an adverse outcome (responder bias).

 It’s commonly agreed that surveillance data based on hos-
pitalization and readmission alone is likely to be an under-
estimate.3 Nevertheless the sequelae of SSI can lead to
significant human and economic impacts, such as longer
hospital lengths of stays, increased resources used for
patient care, and reduction in the health related quality of
life (HRQoL).4 In the United Kingdom (UK), hospital
length of stay (LOS) is typically doubled and additional
per-patient median costs of £3,214 and £2,356 attributable
to SSI are reported for hip and knee procedures, respec-
tively.4 In the US LOS is reportedly increased by 9.5 days
and mean additional costs due to SSI are estimated to be
in the region of $15,129 per orthopaedic admission.5 Fur-
thermore a study by Poultsides6 on in-hospital SSI after
primary hip and knee arthroplasty reports that total treat-
ment costs for patients that experienced a SSI were about
double that of patients without SSI.
Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) has been
used for many years for the treatment of chronic wounds,
such as leg ulcers and bed sores and its effectiveness is
established.7 More recently, NPWT use has been extended
to acute wounds where it is used prophylactically follow-
ing surgery to prevent surgical site complications (SSC).
However, evidence supporting the clinical effectiveness of
NPWT has previously been confined to large non-portable
devices. Today, single-use NPWT devices (sNPWT) capa-
ble of delivering similar functionality to traditional NPWT
devices are available. Such devices are smaller and more
portable, allowing for increased mobility compared with
traditional NPWT devices, which makes them particularly
suitable for post-operative use. The clinical evidence
reporting favorable outcomes from these small portable
sNPWT devices, such as PICO‡ (Smith & Nephew
Healthcare Ltd, Hull, UK) is accumulating rapidly. Sys-
tematic reviews by Hyldig et al.8 and Karlakki et al.9 con-
cluded
that
sNPWT
was
effective
in
reducing
SSI
following surgery.
A recent randomized controlled trial (RCT) by Karlakki
et al.10 concluded that sNPWT (PICO‡) was clinically
effective in reducing post-operative wound complications
following primary hip and knee replacements. The study
found that sNPWT patients experienced a significant
reduction in exudate volume and the number of patients
with the highest volume of exudate (p 5 0.007). A fourfold
reduction in wound complications, 2.0% vs. 8.4% favoring
sNPWT was also reported (p 5 0.06). Although a non-
significant reduction in LOS was found in the intention to
treat analysis, 3.8 days (95% CI, 3.5–4.2) for sNPWT
compared with 4.7 days (95% CI, 3.8–6.4) for the SC
group
(p 5 0.07),
patients
with
American
Society
of
Anaesthesiologists (ASA) score �3 and body mass index
(BMI) �35 were determined by recursive partitioning
analysis most likely to benefit from sNPWT (p 5 0.02).
The purpose of the present analysis is to evaluate the cost-
effectiveness of sNPWT in all patients and sub-groups of
patients at elevated risk of complications undergoing elec-
tive primary hip and knee replacement using the outcomes
data derived from randomized controlled trials.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data for this economic analysis were derived from a clini-
cal trial of 220 consecutively enrolled adults aged 18 years
or older scheduled to undergo routine hip and knee
replacement Karlakki et al.10 The trial was non-blinded,
due to obvious visual differences between the treatment
and standard care dressings. It was conducted between
October 2012 and October 2013 and patients were fol-
lowed for 6 weeks after surgery. Baseline characteristics
of all patients and the sub-groups included in the original
RCT analysis is shown in Table 1.
A decision model was used to simulate the expected
cost and benefits of sNPWT and standard care in accor-
dance with best practice standards for economic evalua-
tions i.e., The Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation
Reporting Standards.11 The perspective adopted was that
of the healthcare payer in the UK. The outcomes assessed
were surgical site complications and quality adjusted life
years (QALYs) and LOS. The expected complications with
standard care were taken from the Karlakki et al. RCT.10
These baseline data were then adjusted to reflect the
expected reduction in complications and LOS reported in
the same RCT observed in patients treated with sNPWT.
The economic model adopted a similar time horizon as
the RCT of 6 weeks post-operatively, which was deemed
sufficient follow-up to capture the majority of SSI and
their associated impact on resource use and outcomes.
Given the short time horizon of less than 1 year, no
discounting was applied to either costs or outcomes.

 Furthermore, mortality was not modelled as the short time-
horizon was considered too short to discern the impact of
intervention on mortality. The schematic representation of
the model is shown in Figure 1.
Two measures of benefits were used in the model;
firstly, incremental complications avoided for the cost-
effectiveness analysis and QALYs for the cost utility anal-
ysis. A QALY is a measure of disease burden, which takes
into account the quantity or length of life and quality of
life generated by healthcare interventions and is used in
assessing the value for money of a medical intervention. A
year of perfect health is worth 1 QALY and a year of less
than perfect health is worth less than 1 while death is con-
sidered to be equivalent to 0
Data on health related quality of life were obtained from
the NICE clinical guideline on surgical site infections
2008.12 The study cited in the guideline reported on the
impact of orthopaedic surgical-site infections (SSIs) on
quality of life, length of hospitalization, and costs. Cases
of orthopaedic SSIs were prospectively identified by infec-
tion control professionals, and matched controls were
selected from the entire cohort of patients undergoing
orthopaedic surgery who did not have an SSI. Quality of
life was measured using the short form of a questionnaire
containing 36 items (SF-36) 1 year post surgery. Results
of the SF-36 were then converted to utility values using a
published algorithm.13 Data for all the clinical input
parameters and quality of life used in the model is shown
in Table 2.
Resource use was not based on the treatment regimen
used in the trial to enhance the generalizability of the cost-
effectiveness results beyond the single centre where the
RCT was performed. Costs were therefore derived from
standard cost references with resource utilization valued in
£(2015/16). The cost of the intervention (sNPWT) was
obtained from the national Drug Tariff.14 We acknowledge
this cost is likely to be higher than the discounted price
that the hospitals actually pay through discounted prices
given to NHS bulk purchasing; therefore we varied the
cost in sensitivity analysis. The model applied the cost of
one sNPWT device, which is designed to last for 7 days
and is supplied with two dressings. In the sensitivity analy-
sis we assumed patients received two sNPWT dressings to
assess changes in expected total costs.
For inpatient care we used an average of NHS reference
costs15 for the following medical diagnosis related groups
(DRGs) HN13 B-H and HN23 A-E for hips and knees to
establish the cost of hospitalization of all patients who had
surgery. The mean cost was £6,725 and lower and upper
costs were £3,863 and £8,280, respectively. The model
assumed that costs of standard care dressings and nursing
costs were all included in the DRG costs.
All patients were on an enhanced recovery programme
and therefore were managed in the community once they
were discharged. After discharge patients were all con-
tacted by phone and were all prescribed low molecular
weight heparin (LMWH), consequently this was not costed
as the costs were assumed to be the same across the two
interventions. Furthermore, all patients were seen at 6
weeks post-surgery in the consultant led follow-up clinic
as per the routine practice and this cost was also excluded
as all patients incurred the same cost. For patients who
experienced complications, we assumed they had two visits
to the GP and received one prescription of antibiotics. The
cost of a GP visit was taken from Unit Costs and Social
Care 2015–201616 while costs of oral antibiotics (assumed
to be flucloxacillin 500 mg QDS or if allergic to penicillin
erythromycin 500 mg QDS) were taken from the Drug
Tariff.14 One of the most common side effects of surgery
is pain. However, the model did not incorporate the costs
of managing pain as it was assumed all patients will be on
pain medication following surgery. Table 3 shows the cost
data that was used in the model.
We did not cost the additional LOS due to infection for
the patients that developed complications in the hospital
making the model conservative since two patients in the
standard care group developed complications as inpatients
and needed surgical washout. Furthermore readmission
was not included in the base case model. The study by
Karlakki et al.10 showed that one patient of the nine

 patients who developed complications (11%) was re-
admitted in the standard care group and none in the
sNPWT group making the model even more conservative
i.e., biased against sNPWT. In the sensitivity analysis, we
tested these two assumptions i.e., included the cost of
additional LOS and readmission in the model. More
patients managed with sNPWT developed minor blisters
(<1 cm) (11%) compared with 1% in the standard care
group which were managed by a foam dressing. In the
model the cost of managing blisters were excluded as they
were deemed to be negligible and the majority of the treat-
ment would be captured in the diagnosis related group
case payment.
Cost-effectiveness analysis
The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) is the
added cost per additional unit of health, in this model mea-
sured in QALYs and complications avoided. This was cal-
culated as the difference between the expected costs
divided by the expected difference between the QALYs or
complications avoided of sNPWT and standard care over
the 6-week time horizon. To determine if the intervention
is cost-effective, the ICER is compared with the maximum
willingness to pay of the healthcare payer, in this case
assumed to be the threshold set by UK payer body The
National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)
of £20,000/QALY. If the calculated ratio is less than what
the payer is willing to pay for a unit of health, the inter-
vention is deemed cost-effective. In the results, we report
both deterministic and probabilistic results for the base
case model. The costs were estimated from the United
Kingdom NHS perspective, however we also used the pur-
chasing power parity conversion factor of 1.42 to convert
pounds into US dollars (Available at http://wdi.worldbank.
org/table/4.16, Accessed January 2017).
Sensitivity analysis
Both deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses
were done. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis entails specify-
ing a distribution for each model parameter to represent
the uncertainty around the point estimate and then select-
ing values at random from those distributions using Monte
Carlo simulation. Essentially, this means the uncertainty
around multiple input assumptions can be tested simulta-
neously, distinct from one-way sensitivity analysis which
allows uncertainty around single inputs to be tested indi-
vidually. The lognormal distribution was implemented to
capture the uncertainty surrounding the treatment effect;
the gamma and beta distributions were used to capture the
uncertainty in cost and utility values, respectively. Two-
thousand simulations were conducted.
A cost-effectiveness plane is also presented which is
divided into four quadrants by the origin, i.e., south east
(SE), north east (NE), south west (SW) and North West
(NW) with each quadrant having a different implication
for economic evaluation.17 The vertical axis divides the
plane according to incremental cost (positive above, nega-
tive below zero) and the horizontal axis divides the plane
according to incremental effect (positive to the right, nega-
tive to the left). Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves
(CEACs) are then calculated by plotting the proportion of
cost and effects pairs that are cost effective for a given
value that the payer is willing to pay. Thus the CEAC
expresses the likelihood the cost-effectiveness estimate
reflects a cost-effective intervention based on the existing
evidence.
One-way sensitivity analyses were conducted by varying
some of the parameters in the model to address the impact
of possible uncertainty in the best information available on
clinical benefits and treatment costs. Each key parameter
was alternately assigned a low and high value and the
deterministic cost-effectiveness results using this value
were recorded. Key parameters varied were costs of hospi-
tal stay, cost of sNPWT and cost of readmissions. Baseline
data were varied across the 95% confidence interval
reported in the trial or lower and upper values reported in
literature. Length of stay in the standard of care group had
a range of 2–61 days affected by two wound related out-
liers. A sensitivity analysis was performed arbitrarily cap-
ping LOS to 13 days (3rd longest LOS in the control
group, see Table 2 for data used). In addition we per-
formed subgroups analysis considering BMI �35 and ASA
score �3. These were deemed as variables that affect the
prognosis of patients undergoing hip and knee surgery as
was reported in analysis.18
RESULTS
The total mean costs for patients in the sNPWT group
were lower than patients in the SC group. The use of
sNPWT was associated with more QALYs and fewer
wound related complications compared with the use of SC.
Overall, the use of sNPWT is technically a dominant strat-
egy compared to SC, i.e., sNPWT costs less and results in

 better clinical outcomes. Table 4 shows both deterministic
and probabilistic results.
Sensitivity analysis
The output of a series of one-way sensitivity analyses is
displayed in Table 5. The results of the analyses illustrate
the mean incremental costs of sNPWT compared with SC.
Negative costs shows that sNPWT is cost-saving compared
with SC. The base-case value was 2£1,132 (2$1,607)
which means sNPWT saves £1,132 ($1,607) per patient in
this patient population. The model remained cost-saving
for all inputs that were changed as shown in Table 5
where all the cost differences are below £0.
Results from the probabilistic sensitivity analysis are
shown on the cost-effectiveness plane in Figure 2. The
cost-effectiveness plane shows that both incremental cost
and incremental QALY estimates are associated with little
uncertainty as the majority of samples are located in the
south east quadrant. The cost-effectiveness acceptability
curves (CEACs) communicate the probability for an inter-
vention to be cost-effective for a range of willingness-to-
pay thresholds (£/QALY). CEACs suggest that the sNPWT
is 91% cost-effective in all analyses for the willingness-to-
pay threshold range of £20,000 recommended by NICE17
and in 79% of the simulations will be dominating standard
care i.e., 79% of the simulations fall in the south east
quadrant shown in Figure 2.
Subgroup analysis
Incidence of SSI and subsequent LOS is affected among
other factors by BMI and ASA grade.10 Therefore, in the
sensitivity analysis we separately compared the cost-
effectiveness of sNPWT and standard of care for patients
with
BMI � 35
and
ASA � 3.

 increases the risk of SSI/complications by 8.3 while a BMI
�35 increases complications by 4.5 compared with the
general population.10 sNPWT was shown in the same
study to reduce LOS by 5.91 days for ASA � 3 and by 6.1
days in those with a BMI �35. The difference was not
statically significant (data from post-hoc analysis of the
RCT data by Karlakki). Tables 6 shows the deterministic
results of ASA � 3 and BMI �35 sub-groups. In all cases
sNPWT was cost saving, with the results showing cost-
savings of £7,955 ($11,296) and £7,248 ($10,293) per

DISCUSSION
The demand for cost-effectiveness evidence has increased
for many reasons. Prime among these are shrinking health
care budgets, growing patient populations and the practice
of value-based treatment decisions. Such decisions do not
focus on the acquisition costs of health care technologies
in isolation; rather, they integrate these within the total
cost of a treatment process. These total costs of care are
then balanced against the entirety of clinical outcomes of
interest measured over a discrete period of time to result
in a cost-effectiveness analysis. We built a decision tree to
investigate the value of sNPWT compared with standard
care in the prevention of complications following total hip
and knee replacement surgery using clinical data from a
recent RCT by Karlakki and his colleagues.10
The use of sNPWT was reported to have delivered a
fourfold reduction in surgical site wound complications
and reduced LOS by 1 day compared with SC.10 The
mean cost per patient in the sNPWT group was estimated
to be £5,602 ($7,954), compared with £6,713 ($9,559) in
the SC group. The use of sNPWT was associated with
0.116 QALYs, compared with 0.115 QALYs for the SC
group. Overall, the sNPWT strategy was on average,
£1,132 ($1,607) less costly, and was associated with fewer
surgical site complications (6 per 100 treated patients) and
more QALYs per patient. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses
suggest that sNPWT has a 91% probability of being cost-
effective with 79% of the simulations finding a dominant
result compared with standard care. The result was robust
to a range of sensitivity analyses.
Similar results were obtained between the deterministic
and probabilistic results for sNPWT compared with stan-
dard care. The model suggests that more savings will be
made when higher risk patients with an ASA � 3 and
BMI � 35 are targeted. This result is partly explained by
the increased baseline risk of complications and associated
increase in LOS in these populations compared with the
general population. This result should be treated with cau-
tion and seen as indicative since the difference in LOS
was not statistically significant and had wider confidence
intervals. Karlakki et al.10 showed that patients with a
higher ASA � 3 and BMI � 35 have an 8 and 4.5 fold
increase in the risk of complications and above average
LOS. This is in line with literature which suggests ASA
score and BMI are prognostic factors for complications in
patients undergoing total hip and knee replacements.18
Economic evaluations are relatively rare in wound care,
largely due to an absence of clinical data. To our knowl-
edge, this study is the first comparative economic evalua-
tion of sNPWT in any setting for patients undergoing total
hip and knee replacements. We conducted a number of
sensitivity analyses and sub-group analyses which all con-
firmed the benefits of sNPWT in preventing SSC follow-
ing total hip and knee replacements.
The economic analysis used clinical data derived from a
well conducted RCT in which the standard care was deter-
mined by individual clinicians. This is one of the strengths
of the RCT as it replicates what happens in real-life clini-
cal scenarios where clinicians use various interventions,
thus making the results more generalizable. Furthermore,
the model adopted a number of conservative assumptions
so the projected savings may actually under-estimate the
true financial impact. Among patients in the standard care
group, 11% of patients who developed complications were
readmitted to the hospital and underwent surgical washout
compared with none in the sNPWT group, and this was
not included in the base case analysis. We note that studies
in Crohn’s Disease (CD) have had similar findings where
patients treated with sNPWT did not experience re-
admission following elective surgery for CD compared
with those treated with standard care.19 Including readmis-
sion in the present analysis resulted in savings of £7,750
($11,005) per patient compared with £1,132 ($1,607) in
the base case. The cost of pain medication was also

 however favor standard care group which had many wound
related complications. Furthermore, we note that there
were few dressing changes in the sNPWT group (1.79
p 5 0.002) which suggests that savings could be more
when staff time is taken into account, time which could be
used for other clinical or non-clinical activities.
There are some limitations associated with this analy-
sis. The transferability of clinical and economic outcomes
is an important issue in health economic evaluation.20
Previous research has demonstrated substantial differ-
ences in both treatment patterns and the nature of cost
savings across countries owing to the differences in
healthcare systems. Reimbursement systems, relative pri-
ces, and treatment practices, are important issues that
vary from country to country. Furthermore, our model is
based on clinical data that comes from a single centre
RCT. While the study investigators were allowed to
select the standard care of their choice, this was largely a
single centre practice which may not be representative of
standard care used across different locations in the UK or
other healthcare systems in the world. Decision-makers
in other healthcare systems should therefore investigate
the cost-effectiveness of sNPWT products in their own
settings. We also note that there was an increased inci-
dence of minor blisters in patients treated with sNPWT
compared with those treated with SC, and the model
excluded the costs of managing the blisters as they were
deemed to be negligible. Occurrence of blisters was
dependent on the experience of the clinician and one way
of minimizing the blisters is to avoid stretching the dress-
ing by applying it on a flexed joint.
The current study also excluded any costs involved in
treating SSC following discharge from the hospital. One
study on the costs of SSI care in a primary setting in the
UK collected data on21 SSI patients following colorectal
surgery and found that primary care costs amount to about
15% of total SSI costs (on average £1,563 ($2,219) out of
£10,523 ($14,943) per SSI patient), thus suggesting that
the largest part of the SSI cost burden comes from inpa-
tient care. As such, whilst we are confident that we have
captured the majority of the resource involved in managing
SSC, there is further reason to believe that the findings
may under-report the true scale of the savings.
In conclusion, we found sNPWT to be a cost-effective
intervention to reduce SSC following total hip and knee
replacements. The analysis demonstrated savings of over
£1,000 ($1,420) per patient were associated with a pol-
icy of using sNPWT immediately post-operatively in hip
and
knee
replacement
surgeries.

identified even greater savings in patients at elevated
risk of surgical site complications. Healthcare providers
may wish to consider how such a technology is applied
in practice and design protocols that identify those
patients at greatest risk of surgical site complications
following total joint replacement, such as patients under-
going revision surgery and patients with multiple co-
morbidities. A targeted approach to adoption such as
this will maximize the efficiency, by addressing those
patients at greatest risk of complications and excess
treatment costs. Prospective research on the costs and
outcomes of sNPWT in this patient population is neces-
sary to validate the results of this economic evaluation.
