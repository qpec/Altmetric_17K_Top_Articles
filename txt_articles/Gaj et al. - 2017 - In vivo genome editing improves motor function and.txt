extends survival in a mouse model of ALS

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal and incurable neurodegenerative disease characterized by the progressive
loss of motor neurons in the spinal cord and brain. In particular, autosomal dominant mutations in the superoxide
dismutase 1 (SOD1) gene are responsible for ~20% of all familial ALS cases. The clustered regularly interspaced short
palindromic repeats (CRISPR)–CRISPR-associated (Cas9) genome editing system holds the potential to treat autosomal
dominant disorders by facilitating the introduction of frameshift-induced mutations that can disable mutant gene
function. We demonstrate that CRISPR-Cas9 can be harnessed to disrupt mutant SOD1 expression in the G93A-
SOD1 mouse model of ALS following in vivo delivery using an adeno-associated virus vector. Genome editing reduced
mutant SOD1 protein by >2.5-fold in the lumbar and thoracic spinal cord, resulting in improved motor function and
reduced muscle atrophy. Crucially, ALS mice treated by CRISPR-mediated genome editing had ~50% more motor neu-
rons at end stage and displayed a ~37% delay in disease onset and a ~25% increase in survival compared to control
animals. Thus, this study illustrates the potential for CRISPR-Cas9 to treat SOD1-linked forms of ALS and other central
nervous system disorders caused by autosomal dominant mutations.
INTRODUCTION
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS; also known as Lou Gehrig’s
disease) is an adult-onset neurological disorder (1) that involves the loss
of motor neurons in the spinal cord, brainstem, and motor cortex. ALS
leads to progressive muscle weakness and atrophy throughout the body,
ultimately leading to paralysis and death within 3 to 5 years of symptom
onset. There is no cure for ALS, and the only U.S. Food and Drug
Administration–approved medications, riluzole and edaravone, are min-
imally effective, increasing survival by only 2 to 3 months in the case of
riluzole (no survival data for edaravone have been reported to date) (2).
Dominant mutations in the Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1)
(3) gene account for ~20% of familial forms of the disease and ~2% of all
cases. The SOD1 gene encodes a metalloenzyme that converts super-
oxide anions into oxygen and hydrogen peroxide and is thus critical
to cellular antioxidant defense. Although the mechanism behind
SOD1 toxicity is not completely understood (4), transgenic animals that
express mutant forms of the gene develop a progressive neuro-
degenerative disease that emulates the hallmarksof ALS (5, 6), including
motor neuron degeneration, muscle wasting, and paralysis. Reducing
mutant SOD1expression in the spinalcord using antisense oligonucleo-
tides (ASOs) (7, 8) or RNA interference (RNAi) (9–15) can slow disease
onset and improve survival in these animal models. However, to date,
ASOs have been unable to reduce mutant SOD1 protein in ALS patients
(16), and both ASOs and RNAi can be hampered by incomplete
knockdown, which limits their effectiveness as therapeutics.
Genome editing offers an alternative approach to treat autosomal
dominant disorders, including many familial forms of ALS, via the dis-
ruption of mutant gene function. In particular, the RNA-guided Cas9
endonuclease(17)fromclusteredregularly interspacedshortpalindromic
repeats (CRISPR)–CRISPR-associated (Cas) systems has emerged as a
versatile genome editing tool (18–21). Cas9 can be targeted to genomic
loci to induce a DNA double-strand break (DSB) via RNA-DNA base
complementarity using a single-guide RNA (sgRNA). DSBs induced by
Cas9 enable the introduction of frameshift-inducing base insertions and/
or deletions (indels) that can disrupt gene expression following DNA
repair (22). Given these features, we reasoned that CRISPR-Cas9 could
be used to treat familial ALS via genome editing following its in vivo
delivery into an animal model of the disease using an adeno-associated
virus (AAV) vector.
Here, we demonstrate that CRISPR-Cas9 can disrupt mutant SOD1
expression in the spinal cord of the G93A-SOD1 mouse model of ALS.
Systemic administration of an AAV9 vector encoding the Cas9 nuclease
with an sgRNA targeting the human SOD1G93A gene to neonatalG93A-
SOD1 mice reduced mutant SOD1 protein in the spinal cord and en-
hanced the survival of motor neurons. This therapeutic genome editing
strategy delayed disease onset, improved motor function, reduced muscle
atrophy, and, critically, extended survival in ALS mice. These results thus
establish that CRISPR-mediated genome editing can be used to treat
familialALS and potentially othercentral nervoussystem(CNS) disorders
caused by autosomal dominant mutations.
RESULTS
Disruption of mutant SOD1 expression using CRISPR-Cas9
We used the Cas9 nuclease from Staphylococcus aureus (SaCas9) (23) to
target the mutant SOD1 gene in the G93A-SOD1 mouse model of ALS
(5), which carries ~25 tandem repeat copies of the hSOD1G93A trans-
gene and recapitulates many aspects of the disease, including progres-
sive muscle atrophy and impaired motor function. Unlike the larger
Cas9 nuclease from Streptococcus pyogenes (17–21), SaCas9, along with
its sgRNA and a full-length cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter, can fit
into a single AAV particle to drive expression in vivo (Fig. 1A). More
than 100 mutations in SOD1 have been identified in patients with fa-
milial ALS. Because of this heterogeneity, we designed several sgRNAs
that do not overlap with the G93A mutation and could be applicable to
other ALS-linked SOD1 variants, including wild-type SOD1, which has

 been associatedwithsporadic ALS(24). Notably, noadverseeffectswere
observed in a clinical trial for ALS using an ASO that targets both
mutant and wild-type SOD1 (16).
We evaluated the ability of SaCas9 and the designed sgRNA to dis-
rupt the mutant SOD1 expression in mouse neuroblastoma–spinal
cord–34 (NSC-34) cells stably transfected with complementary DNA
(cDNA) encoding hSOD1G93A. NSC-34 cells are frequently used to
study certain aspects of ALS in vitro because they share several morpho-
logical and physiological similarities with motor neurons (25). The most
efficient sgRNA targeted exon 2 of the hSOD1G93A coding sequence
(Fig. 1B and fig. S1) and reduced mutant protein by ~92% in SaCas9-
expressing cells, which we enriched using fluorescence-activated cell
sorting (FACS) following cotransfection with an enhanced green fluo-
rescent protein (EGFP)–encoding surrogate reporter plasmid (fig. S2A).
Sangersequencingrevealedthepresenceofindelsin~94%ofhSOD1G93A
transgenes analyzed from these cells (fig. S2B), confirming that mu-
tant SOD1 expression was disrupted by SaCas9-mediated genome
editing. Despite the potential for off-target (OT) disruption of the
mouse SOD1 gene, we observed no significant difference (P > 0.5) in
mouse SOD1 protein in NSC-34cells expressing SaCas9 with an sgRNA
targeting either the hSOD1 gene or the mouse Rosa26 locus, a genomic
“safe harbor site” often used for mouse transgenesis (fig. S2A). These
resultsindicatethat SaCas9anditssgRNAdiscriminate between human
and mouse alleles.
In vivo genome editing in ALS mice
We next evaluated whether CRISPR-Cas9 could reduce mutant SOD1
expression in vivo following delivery to G93A-SOD1 mice using an
AAV vector. AAV is a promising in vivo gene delivery vehicle found
to be safe and effective in an increasing number of clinical trials, includ-
ing those for hemophilia B (26), choroideremia (27), Leber’s congenital
amaurosis type II (28), and lipoprotein lipase deficiency (29, 30). When
administrated systemically to neonatal mice, AAV9 (31) can cross the
blood-brain barrier and, within the spinal cord, transduce motor neu-
rons, sensory fibers, and, to a lesser extent, astrocytes (32, 33). Both mo-
tor neurons (determinants of onset and early disease progression) (34)
and astrocytes (secrete neurotoxic factors that can selectively kill motor
neurons) (35–40) play an important role in SOD1-linked ALS. In light
of this pathology, and considering a recent report highlighting the
benefits of early gene therapy intervention in G93A-SOD1 mice (12),
we used neonatal AAV9 delivery for this proof-of-concept study.
We injected G93A-SOD1 mice with AAV9 encoding SaCas9 and
an sgRNA targeting either the hSOD1 gene (AAV9-SaCas9-hSOD1)
or the mRosa26 locus (AAV9-SaCas9-mRosa26) via the facial vein at

 postnatal days 0 and 1 (P0-P1) (Fig. 1C and fig. S3). We used a double
tyrosine mutant of AAV9 that we (41) and others (42) previously devel-
oped to enhance gene delivery to the CNS. Spinal cord sections were
analyzed by immunohistochemistry for expression of (i) the motor neu-
ron marker choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), (ii) SaCas9 via a geneti-
cally fused HA epitope, and (iii) mutant SOD1, which we detected using
an antibody that preferentially recognizes human protein (fig. S4). We
observed SaCas9 expression primarily in the ventral horn of the spinal
cord (fig. S5) and found that ~74% of all ChAT+ cells examined
throughout the anterior gray column expressed SaCas9, indicating
broad motor neuron transduction. We also observed SaCas9 expression
in fibers in the ventral horn, which we detected using the neurite marker
b3-tubulin (fig. S6). As indicated by immunostaining for the astrocytic
marker glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), we observed little SaCas9
expression in gray and white matter astrocytes (fig. S7), potentially due
to limited transduction by the AAV vector and/or suboptimal expres-
sion from the CMV promoter.
Compared to control animals, mutant SOD1 was reduced in trans-
duced spinal cord cells in G93A-SOD1 mice infused with AAV9-
SaCas9-hSOD1 (Fig. 1D). Western blot analysis of spinal cord lysate
indicated that mutant SOD1 protein was decreased in CRISPR-treated
mice by ~3-fold (P = 0.001) and ~2.5-fold (P < 0.05) in the lumbar and
thoracic regions, respectively (Fig. 1E and fig. S8). Consistent with in
vitro studies in NSC-34 cells (fig. S2), no significant difference (P >
0.5) in mouse SOD1 protein was observed in the spinal cord lysate from
treated versus untreated animals (fig. S9). Intriguingly, despite its effi-
cient transduction, we also observed no significant difference (P > 0.5)
inmutantSOD1 proteinin the cervicalspinalcordof gene-editedG93A-
SOD1 mice (fig. S8), potentially because of variability among treated
animals.
To evaluate indel formation in vivo, we deep-sequenced hSOD1G93A
transgenes amplified from dissected spinal cord tissue, which included
transduced motor neurons, as well as nontransduced nerve and glial
cells from the white and gray matter. These latter cell populations,
which are much more numerous than motor neurons, were not ex-
pected to be gene-modified on the basis of our immunohistochemistry
results. According to CRISPResso (a software pipeline that analyzes ge-
nome editing outcomes from deep sequencing data) (43), indels were
present in ~0.2 and ~0.4% of sequenced hSOD1G93A transgenes from
the lumbar and thoracic spinal cord of CRISPR-treated mice, respec-
tively, corresponding to a ~7-fold (P = 0.01) and ~14-fold (P < 0.05)
increase over control animals (Fig. 1F). Consistent with Western blot
results showing no difference in mutant SOD1 protein in the cervical
spinalcord of gene-edited mice (Fig. 1Eand fig. S8), we also observed no

 significant increase in indel formation in cervical spinal cord samples
from CRISPR-modified animals (0.05% modification frequency; P >
0.05 compared to controls).
We next investigated whether SaCas9 induced OT modifications
in vivo. Using Cas-OFFinder (44), we identified 12 potential OT
sites in the mouse genome that differed from the on-target SaCas9
cleavage site by up to four mismatches (fig. S10A). Deep sequencing
revealed no significant increase in indel formation at each candidate
OT site in CRISPR-treated mice compared to control animals (P > 0.1
for all) (fig. S10B).
Therapeutic benefits of CRISPR-mediated gene editing in a
mouse model of ALS
To test whether in vivo disruption of mutant SOD1 by CRISPR-Cas9
provides therapeutic benefit, we monitored motor function, weight loss,
and atrophy in G93A-SOD1 mice injected with AAV9-SaCas9-hSOD1,
AAV9-SaCas9-mRosa26, or AAV9-EGFP at P0-P1. Compared to con-
trol animals, disease onset (that is, peak weight) in mice infused with
AAV9-SaCas9-hSOD1 was delayed by 33 days (hSOD1, 126 ± 5.7 days;
mRosa26, 93 ± 9.6; EGFP, 92 ± 8.1; uninjected, 92 ± 8.8; P < 0.0001)
(Fig. 2A) and ranged from 119 to 133 days in treated animals compared
to 77 to 98 days in control mice (P = 0.0001) (Fig. 2B). Mean survival
also increasedby 28 to 30 days in treated mice (hSOD1, 152.4± 7.9 days;
mRosa26, 122.8 ± 6.1; EGFP, 124 ± 3.8; uninjected, 125 ± 3.5; P <
0.0001) (Fig. 2C) and ranged from 142 to 167 days in treated animals
compared to 114 to 136 days in control animals (P < 0.0001) (Fig. 2D).
Compared to age-matched controls, animals treated by CRISPR-Cas9
displayed improved motor function (P < 0.0001) based on rotarod
performance (Fig. 2E) and maintained and/or gained weight (P <
0.0001) for 28 to 35 days beyond the expected point of disease onset
(Fig. 2F). Treated mice also exhibited reduced muscular atrophy, as evi-
dencedbyaslowerrateof weightlossafterdisease onset[hSOD1,−0.42±
0.015 weight (%) per day; mRosa26, −0.67 ± 0.05; EGFP, −0.63 ± 0.067;
P < 0.005] (fig. S11). Notably, following the eventual onset of disease, we
observed no slowing in disease progression (that is, the length of time
between disease onset and end point) (fig. S12), likely due to insufficient
gene editing in astrocytes, which contribute to disease progression in
SOD1-linked forms of ALS (34, 35, 45–47).
Compared to control animals, immunofluorescent staining of spinal
cord sections from end-stage mice revealed that animals treated by
CRISPR-Cas9 had ~50% more ChAT+ neurons in the lumbar (P <
0.05) and thoracic (P < 0.001) regions of the spinal cord (Fig. 3). This
suggests that CRISPR-Cas9 conferred protection to some individual
motor neurons. In addition, consistent with our earlier findings (fig. S7),
we observed limited SaCas9 expression in GFAP+ astrocytes in end-stage
spinal cord sections from CRISPR-treated animals (fig. S13), as well as
immunoreactive mutant SOD1 inclusion bodies in many of the same
cells (fig. S14). Optimization of AAV-mediated gene delivery and/
or SaCas9 expression in astrocytes (35, 40), microglia (34, 46, 48),
and oligodendrocyte precursors (49, 50) may further enhance efficacy.
Collectively, these results demonstrate that CRISPR-Cas9–mediated
disruption of mutant SOD1 expression in G93A-SOD1 mice enhances
the survival of spinal cord motor neurons and improves motor function
and life span.
DISCUSSION
Genome editing technologies can be used to introduce precise genomic
modifications into mammalian cells and model organisms (51) and
thus hold tremendous potential for treating the genetic causes of many
diseases. Here, we have shown that CRISPR-Cas9 can reduce mutant
SOD1 protein in the spinal cord following systemic delivery using an
AAV vector. This therapeutic genome editing strategy delayed disease
onset, improved motor function, and, critically, increased survival, illus-
trating the utility of genome editing to treat SOD1-linked ALS and po-
tentially otherCNS disorderscausedby autosomaldominantmutations,
suchasHuntington’sdisease or the spinocerebellarataxias. These results
build on basic research studies by ourlaboratory (52) and others (53, 54)
showing that CRISPR systems can induce gene editing in the mam-
malian brain and demonstrates that therapeutic genome editing can
be achieved in tissues beyond the liver (55–58) and muscle (59–62) in
animal models of human disease.
Both motor neurons (determinants of onset and early disease pro-
gression) (34) and astrocytes (secrete factors that selectively kill motor
neurons) (35–40) play an important role in SOD1-ALS. Because of its
innate capacity to cross the blood-brain barrier and transduce spinal

 cord motor neurons and, to a lesser extent, astrocytes, we used AAV9 to
deliver our CRISPR gene editing system to G93A-SOD1 mice at P0-
P1. Because neonatal delivery has proven effective for evaluating
RNAi-based gene therapies in G93A-SOD1 mice (10, 12, 14), we rea-
soned that this strategy would enable us to assess the impact of genome
editing on disease onset and progression. Notably, AAV administration
to neonatal mice previously facilitated the validation of zinc-finger
nuclease– and CRISPR-based strategies for correcting hemophilia B
(55) and ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency (57), respectively. In
addition, a phase 1 clinical trial based on AAV9-mediated delivery of
thesurvivalofmotorneuron1(SMN1)geneforspinalmuscularatrophy
(63, 64) in infants is under way, underscoring the therapeutic potential
of this serotype.
Immunohistochemistry analysis of spinal cord sections from
CRISPR-treated mice revealedthat SaCas9 expression, as wellasmutant
SOD1 gene disruption, was confined primarily to ChAT+ motor
neurons. This finding was reinforced by end-stage histological anal-
ysis, which showed limited SaCas9 labeling in GFAP+ astrocytes and
the presence of presumably toxic mutant SOD1 inclusion bodies in
many of the same cells. These results collectively support the hypothesis
that inefficient SOD1 disruption in astrocytes could contribute to the
lack of slowing in disease progression that we observed in gene-edited
mice. Advancing this first-in-class CRISPR-based gene therapy for a
CNS disorder toward the clinic will therefore require optimizing gene
delivery vehicles for human use (65) and enhancing Cas9 expression in
motor neurons, astrocytes, and other cell types implicated in SOD1-
ALS. The rapidly expanding catalog of Cas9 orthologs (several of which
are smaller than SaCas9) (66, 67) may also enable the use of specialized
and/or larger promoter sequences incompatible with the all-in-one
AAV vector strategy used here, or additional components that can drive
self-inactivation of Cas9, and thereby enhance safety.
Because of its rapid and robust phenotype, the G93A-SOD1 mouse
model of ALS is among the most widely used transgenic models of the
disease. This mouse carries ~25 tandem repeat copies of the hSOD1G93A
transgene, and previous reports have indicated that a reduction in
hSOD1G93A copy number can have a profound effect on the ALS phe-
notype (68). Despite the challenge that high-copy repetitive elements
can pose from the perspective of genome editing, the Cas9 nuclease
has facilitated the disruption of up to 62 copies of the porcine endoge-
nous retrovirus in a kidney epithelial cell line (69), indicating its capacity
for multiplexing and targeting high-copy elements. Although it is dif-
ficult to determine the number of gene-edited hSOD1G93A transgenes
in transduced spinal cord cells, we showed that SaCas9 modified ~94%
of hSOD1G93A alleles in transfected NSC-34 cells.
The CRISPR-based genome editing strategy used here cannot distin-
guish between mutant and the wild-type human SOD1, which performs
important functions in cells. However, in a phase 1 clinical trial, no ad-
verse effects were observed in ALS patients treated with an ASO target-
ing both mutant and wild-type SOD1 (16). If needed, an allele-specific
CRISPR system configured to target disease-causing SOD1 mutations
(including A4V, G37R, H46R, G85R, and G93A) or a gene knockout-
and-replace therapy (70) could be used to overcome the toxicity arising
from a lack of allele specificity. Because the PAM sequence recognized
by SaCas9 (that is, NNGRRT) occurs less frequently than those for the
more commonly used Cas9 from S. pyogenes (that is, NGG), it may be
necessary to alter the PAM specificity of SaCas9 (71) to discriminate
between the mutant and wild-type SOD1 alleles.
We used the Cas-OFFinder algorithm (44) to identify candidate OT
cleavage sites for the SaCas9 nuclease. This software is not limited by the
number of mismatches in the sgRNA sequence and allows for subtle
variations in the PAM recognized by Cas9. Using deep sequencing,
we observed no increase in indel formation at each candidate OT site
in CRISPR-treated mice versus control animals. However, the use of
unbiased genome-wide approaches that rely on the in situ capture of
adapter sequences at nuclease-induced DSBs (23, 72) or cell-free di-
gestion of genomic DNA using Cas9 ribonucleoprotein (73) could
facilitate the formation of a comprehensive portrait of SaCas9 cleav-
age specificity. In addition, whole-exome genome sequencing of
CRISPR-treated motor neurons differentiated from human-induced
pluripotent stem cells derived from SOD1-ALS patients would yield
critical insight into the specificity of SaCas9 in a more therapeutically
relevant context. Given that the OT activity of a nuclease is propor-
tional to its concentration and the amount of time it is exposed to the
cell (74), future work elucidating the kinetics of Cas9 expression in vivo
could shed light on its function and inform methods for improving
its specificity.
Finally, there are several limitations to this study that should be dis-
cussed. First, we observed a ~2.5-fold reduction in mutant SOD1 pro-
tein in the lumbar and thoracic spinal cord but detected indels in only
0.2 to 0.4% of sequenced hSOD1G93A transgenes. Although the under-
lying reason for this difference requires further exploration, studies have
demonstrated that genome editing can elicit a phenotypic effect that
exceedsthemeasuredindelfrequency(23,75).Inourcase,thisdifference
could potentially be explained by CRISPR interference (76), which may
function alongside SaCas9-mediated genome editing to reduce mutant
SOD1 protein. Furthermore, we deep-sequencedhSOD1G93A transgenes
amplifiedfromwhole spinalcordtissue,whichincludedbothtransduced
motor neurons and nontransduced cells from the white and gray matter,
the latter of which are more numerous than motor neurons and may not
express as much mutant SOD1. The Allen Spinal Cord Atlas online
database indicates that, in P56 mice, SOD1 is more strongly expressed
in the anterior horn of the spinal cord, where lower motor neurons re-
side, as well as the posterior horn. This is consistent with our own im-
munostaining in 28-day-old G93A-SOD1 mice (fig. S4). Thus, higher
SOD1 gene expression in transduced versus nontransduced cells at the
time of analysis (that is, 28 days) could possibly contribute to the ob-
served discrepancy. Second, because of the difficulty in isolating spinal
cord motor neurons from juvenile and adult mice (77), we could not
measure the frequency of hSOD1G93A gene modification in transduced
cells. Future work using transgenic mice expressing a GFP reporter in
motor neurons (78) could facilitate analysis of indel formation or
SOD1 messenger RNA following FACS enrichment. Third, we observed
variable and inefficient editing in the cervical spinal cord of G93A-SOD1
mice. Further optimization of SaCas9 expression in preclinical large
animal models using increased samples sizes can help resolve this point.
Finally, we did not administer the AAV vector to adult animals in this
proof-of-concept study. Assessing the efficacy of CRISPR-mediated dis-
ruption of mutant SOD1 in adult ALS mice both before and after dis-
ease onset will be critical in establishing the potential of this approach
for clinical translation.
In conclusion, we have demonstrated that CRISPR-Cas9–mediated
gene editing provides therapeutic benefit to the G93A-SOD1 mouse
model of ALS. This work establishes genome editing as a possible
therapy for ALS and paves the way for this technology to treat other
forms of the disease, including those caused by a hexanucleotide
repeat expansion in the C9orf72 gene (79, 80), which could poten-
tially be excised by Cas9 following its coexpression with a pair of
sgRNA flanking the repeat expansion.

 MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design
The objective of this study was to determine whether genome editing
could be used to treat ALS. We theorized that CRISPR-Cas9–mediated
disruption of the hSOD1G93A transgene in the G93A-SOD1 mouse
model of ALS could slow or halt disease onset and progression, as well
as provide therapeutic benefit. We used the Surveyor nuclease assay and
Western blot to identify the sgRNA that could mediate disruption of
hSOD1G93A in vitro. For in vivo studies, G93A-SOD1 mice were
injected with the AAV vector via the facial vein at P0-P1. All treatments
consisted of a single vector administration. The mice were scarified
4 weeks after injection. Mutant SOD1 protein was measured via immu-
nohistochemistry and Western blot, and indels were evaluated using
deep sequencing. For behavior studies, treatment groups were gender-
balanced, and the animals were monitored daily with weight and
rotarod performance measured weekly. End stage was determined as
described in the “Behavior” section. No blinding was used to perform
measurements. The expected effect and SD for each experiment were
informed frompublished literature. From this information, sample sizes
were determined by power calculations using a = 0.05 and b = 0.80. All
animals were included in the statistical analysis, and the sample size re-
flects the number of independent biological replicates. Statistical
methods are described in the “Statistical analysis” section.
Plasmid construction
The human Cu-Zn SOD1 gene (Entrez Gene ID, 6647) was searched for
SaCas9 cleavage sites (23) using the motif 5′-G-(N)21–24-NNGRRT-3′
(where N is A, T, C, or G and R is A or G). A “G” nucleotide was used at
the 5′ end of the sgRNA to ensure efficient expression from the U6
promoter. Oligonucleotides encoding sgRNA-targeting sequences were
custom-synthesized (Elim Biopharm) and phosphorylated by T4 poly-
nucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) for 30 min at 37°C. Oligonu-
cleotides were then annealed for 5 min at 95°C, fast cooled on ice for
10 min, and ligated into the Bsa I restriction site of pAAV-CMV-
SaCas9-U6-sgRNA (Addgene, #61591) (23). Correct insertion of
each sgRNA was verified by DNA sequencing. The sequences of oligo-
nucleotides used in this study are shown in table S1.
Cell culture
Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells [University of California
(UC)BerkeleyTissueCultureFacility]andmouseNSC-34cells(Cedarlane
Laboratories) (25) were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium (DMEM; Corning) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine
serum (FBS; Life Technologies) and 1% (v/v) Antibiotic-Antimycotic
(Anti-Anti; Life Technologies) in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere
at 37°C. The NSC-G93A-SOD1 cell line was generated by stable trans-
fection of NSC-34 cells with linearized pF155-pcDNA-SOD1-G93A
plasmid (Addgene, #26401) (81) followed by selection with G418
(400 mg/ml;Sigma-Aldrich).SingleG418-resistantclones were isolated
bylimiting dilution,andhSOD1G93AexpressionwasverifiedbyWestern
blot. NSC-34–G93A–SOD1 cells were maintained in DMEM with 10%
(v/v) FBS, 1% (v/v) Anti-Anti, and G418 (400 mg/ml).
Surveyor nuclease assay
NSC-34–G93A–SOD1 cells were seeded onto 24-well plates at a density
of 3 × 105 cells per well. At 24 hours after seeding, the cells were trans-
fectedwith800ngofpAAV-CMV-SaCas9-U6-sgRNAusingLipofectamine
3000 (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
At 72 hours after transfection, the cells were harvested, and genomic
DNA was isolated using QuickExtract DNA Extraction Solution
(Epicentre). The hSOD1G93A coding sequence was amplified by
nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the Expand High Fi-
delity Taq System (Roche) with the following primers: pcDNA-SOD1-
Fwd and BGH-Rev (external) and CMV-Fwd and pcDNA-SOD1-Rev
(internal) (table S1). Following PCR amplification, the Surveyor
Mutation Detection Kit (Integrated DNA Technologies) was used
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cleavage products were
visualized by nondenaturing tris-borate EDTA–polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis (PAGE), and the frequency of gene modification was
determined by measuring the ratio of cleaved to uncleaved substrate,
as described by Guschin et al. (82). Band intensity was quantitated using
Image Lab software (Bio-Rad).
Sanger sequencing
NSC-34–G93A–SOD1 cells were seeded onto 12-well plates at a density
of 6 × 105 cells per well. At 24 hours after seeding, the cells were trans-
fected with 1.4 mg of pAAV-CMV-SaCas9-U6-sgRNA and 200 ng of
pAAV-CAG-EGFP using Lipofectamine 3000. At 72 hours after trans-
fection, EGFP+ NSC-34–G93A–SOD1 cells were isolated by FACS (BD
Bioscience Influx Sorter; UC Berkeley Flow Cytometry Core Facility),
and genomic DNA was purified as described above. The hSOD1G93A
transgene was then PCR-amplified using the primers hSOD1-EcoRI-
Fwd and BGH-Rev (table S1) and cloned into the Eco RI and Xho I
restriction sites of pcDNA 3.1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Individual
transformed colonies were mini-prepped and sequenced using the
primer CMV-Fwd.
Western blot
G93A-SOD1 mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of
ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg) and transcardially
perfused with saline. Dissected and homogenized spinal cord tissue,
as well as cultured NSC-34–G93A–SOD1 cells, were lysed by radio-
immunoprecipitation assay buffer [10 mM tris-HCl, 140 mM NaCl,
1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, and 0.5% sodium deoxy-
cholate (pH 8.0)], and protein concentration was determined using
the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Then,
15 mg of protein was electrophoresed by SDS-PAGE and electropho-
retically transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane in transfer buffer
[20 mM tris-HCl, 150 mM glycine, and 20% (v/v) methanol] for 1 hour
at 160 V. Membranes were blocked with 5% (v/v) Blotting-Grade
Blocker (Bio-Rad) in tris-buffered saline (TBS) [20 mM tris-HCl,
150 mM NaCl, and 0.1% (pH 7.5)] with 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST)
and incubated overnight with primary antibodies in blocking solution.
The following primary antibodieswere used: rabbit anti-hSOD1 (1:2000;
Cell Signaling Technology, 2770S), rabbit anti-m/hSOD1 (1:1000; Ther-
mo Fisher Scientific, PA5-27240), rabbit anti–glyceraldehyde-3-
phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (1:5000; Abcam, EPR16891),
and rabbit anti–b-actin (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology, 4970S).
The membranes were washed three times with TBST and incubated
with goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody horseradish peroxidase
conjugate (1:5000, Thermo Fisher Scientific, 65-6120) in blocking solu-
tion for 1 hour at room temperature. After three washes with TBST, the
blot was developed using SuperSignal West Dura Extended Duration
Substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and visualized by automated
chemiluminescence using the Gel Doc XR Imaging System (Bio-Rad).
Band intensity was quantitated using Image Lab software (Bio-Rad).
Total mutant SOD1 protein was normalized to b-actin or GAPDH con-
trol protein in each lane.

 AAV vector production
AAV vector was produced, as previously described (83). Briefly,
HEK293T cells were seeded onto 15-cm plates at a density of 3 × 107
cells per plate in a serum-containing medium. At 24 hours after seeding
or once cells were 90% confluent, the cells were transfected with 15 mg of
pAAV-CMV-SaCas9-U6-sgRNA or pAAV-CMV-EGFP, 15 mg of
pAAV9-2YF (41) [encoding the double tyrosine–to–phenylalanine
mutant of the AAV9 capsid (42)], and 15 mg of pHelper using 145 ml
of polyethylamine (1mg/ml). At48 hoursaftertransfection, the cellswere
harvested by manual dissociation using a cell scraper and centrifuged
at 4000g for 5 min at room temperature. The medium was removed,
and the cells were resuspended in 2 ml of lysis buffer [50 mM tris-HCl
and 150mMNaCl (pH 8.0)]per15-cm plate. Thecellswere freeze-thawed
three times using a dry ice–ethanol bath and a 37°C water bath. Cell lysate
was then incubated with 10 units of Benzonase (Sigma-Aldrich) per mil-
liliterofcelllysatefor30minat37°Candcentrifugedat10,000gfor10min
at room temperature. Supernatant was then overlaid onto an iodixanol
density gradient, and virus was purified by ultracentrifugation (84).
AAV was washed three times with 15 ml of phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS) with 0.001% Tween 20 using an Ultra-15 Centrifugal Filter Unit
(Amicon) at 4000g and concentrated to ~150 ml. Virus was stored at 4°C,
and the viral genomic titer was determined by quantitative real-time PCR
using SYBR Green (Sigma-Aldrich) with the primers qPCR-CMV-Fwd
and qPCR-CMV-Rev (table S1).
Injections
All animal procedures were approved by the Office of Laboratory
Animal Care at the University of California at Berkeley and conducted
in accordance with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Guide for
the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Eight-week-old male G93A-
SOD1 mice (5) [B6SJL-Tg(SOD1*G93A)1Gur/J; The Jackson Laborato-
ry, stock #002726] were bred with female B6SJLF1/J mice (The Jackson
Laboratory, stock #100012). At 20 to 22 days after initiating breeding, P0-
P1 pups were intravenously injected via the facial vein with ~4 × 1011
vector genomes of AAV9-CMV-SaCas9-U6-sgRNA or AAV9-CMV-
EGFP in 40 ml of PBS with 0.001% Tween 20. Before injection, the
animals were genotyped for the presence of the hSOD1G93A transgene
by PCR using genomic DNA purified from a tail clip with the prim-
ers hSOD1-Tg-Fwd and hSOD1-Tg-Rev (table S1).
Behavior
Eight weeks after injections, treated and control G93A-SOD1 mice were
weighed weekly and monitored for changes in body mass three times a
week. Treatment groups were gender-balanced (AAV9-EGFP, male = 4
and female = 3; AAV9-SaCas9-mRosa26, male = 3 and female = 4; and
AAV9-SaCas9-hSOD1, male = 4 and female = 3), and measurements
were not performed in a blinded manner. Disease onset was retrospec-
tively defined as the age at which animals reached peak weight. Motor
coordination was measured once a week using a Rotamex-5 rotarod
(Columbus Instruments International). The animals were placed onto
the apparatus, and the latency to fall (measured in seconds) was re-
cordedforeachmouse. Eachsession consisted of three trials on a rotarod
programmed to accelerate from 4 to 40 rpm in 180 s. All data were nor-
malized to both starting body weight and starting rotarod time and
determined at 8 weeks. Disease end stage was determined as the point
when the animals could no longer turn themselves over within 10 s of
being placed on their back or after full paralysis of the hindlimbs. The
mice were provided with wet mashed food in their cages at the first sign
of hindlimb paralysis and were henceforth monitored daily.
Immunofluorescent staining
Mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of ketamine
(100 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg) and transcardially perfused with
0.9% saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde. Spinal cords were post-
fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight at 4°C and stored in 30%
sucrose. The spinal cords were then harvested and cut into 40-mm
coronal sections using a Microtome HM 500 cryostat. The sections
were transferred to a 96-well plate and stored in cryoprotectant at
−20°C. The sections were washed three times with PBS, incubated
with blocking solution [PBS with 10% (v/v) donkey serum (Sigma-
Aldrich) and 1% Triton X-100] for 2 hours at room temperature and
stained with primary antibodies in blocking solution for 72 hours at
4°C. The stained sections were then washed three times with PBS and
incubated with secondary antibodies for 2 hours at room temperature
followed by a 10-min incubation with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
nuclear stain (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The sections were washed
three times with PBS, mounted onto slides using VECTASHIELD Hard
Set Antifade Mounting Medium (Vector Laboratories), and visualized
using a Zeiss Axio Scan.Z1 and a Zeiss LSM 880 NLO Axio Examiner
with optical parametric oscillator (OPO) (UC Berkeley Molecular Im-
aging Center). Image analysis was performed using ImageJ software
(http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/).
The following primary antibodies were used for spinal cord sections:
rabbit anti-hSOD1 (1:200; Cell Signaling Technology, 2770S), goat anti-
ChAT (1:50; EMD Millipore; AB144P), mouse anti-HA (1:500; Abcam,
ab18181), goat anti-HA (1:250; GenScript, A00168), mouse anti–b3-
tubulin (1:1000; Sigma-Aldrich, T8578), chicken anti-GFAP (1:1000;
Abcam, ab4674), and mouse anti-GFP (1:100, Abcam, ab1218). The
following secondary antibodies were used: donkey anti-rabbit Cy3
(Jackson ImmunoResearch, 711-165-152), donkey anti-goat Alexa Fluor
647 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A-21447), donkey anti-goat Alexa Fluor
488 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A-11055), donkey anti-mouse Alexa
Fluor 555 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A-31570), donkey anti-chicken
Alexa Fluor 647 (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 703-605-155), and donkey
anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 715-545-150).
Deep sequencing
Candidate OT cleavage sites were identified using Cas-OFFinder (44).
Consistent with past reports (57, 59–61), the mouse reference genome
(mm10) was searched for sequences with up to four total mismatches
(up to two nucleotide mismatches and up to two DNA or sgRNA bulges)
from the on-target site in the hSOD1G93A transgene. The 12 OT sites
withthe highestdegree ofsequence similarity to the3′endof thesgRNA
werechosen foranalysis. Genomic DNA waspurifiedfromwhole spinal
cord tissue from G93A-SOD1 mice injected with AAV9-SaCas9-
hSOD1 orAAV9-EGFP using the DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen).
Each candidate OT site was amplified by PCR (table S2) using Phusion
High-Fidelity DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs). Single-read
Illumina flow cell–binding sequences and target site–specific barcodes
(table S3) were incorporated during a second round of PCR. PCR
products were then gel-purified using the PureLink Quick Gel Extrac-
tion and PCR Purification Combo Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Bar-
coded amplicons were pooled together and sequenced using the MiSeq
System (Illumina) with TruSeq SBS Kit v3-HS (Illumina) (QB3 Vincent
J. Coates Genomics Sequencing Laboratory). Multiplexed samples were
deconvoluted on the basis of unique barcodes, and adapter sequences
were trimmed from the reads. Indel quantitation was performed using
CRISPResso (43). Sequences were filtered for >99% confidence
(phred33 ≥ 20) per read. Sequence alignment was performed on

 filtered reads using EMBOSS Needle using the default CRISPResso set-
tings. Indels were measured within a 5–base pair window surrounding
the predicted SaCas9 cleavage site to minimize false-positive classification.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using Prism 7 (GraphPad Software).
Mutant SOD1 protein was compared using two-tailed paired t test. Dis-
ease onset and survival were compared using one-way ANOVA
followed by Tukey’s post hoc analysis. Rotarod times and weight loss
were compared using two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post
hoc analysis. Kaplan-Meier plots were analyzed using the log-rank test.
Motor neuron survival and deep sequencing data were compared using
two-tailed unpaired t test. All analyses were considered statistically sig-
nificant at P < 0.05.
