Abstract
Age-related macular degeneration in its neovascular form (NV
AMD) is the leading cause of vision loss among adults above the
age of 60. Epidemiological data suggest that in men, overall
abdominal obesity is the second most important environmental
risk factor after smoking for progression to late-stage NV AMD. To
date, the mechanisms that underscore this observation remain ill-
defined. Given the impact of high-fat diets on gut microbiota, we
investigated whether commensal microbes influence the evolution
of AMD. Using mouse models of NV AMD, microbiotal transplants,
and other paradigms that modify the gut microbiome, we uncou-
pled weight gain from confounding factors and demonstrate that
high-fat diets exacerbate choroidal neovascularization (CNV) by
altering
gut
microbiota.

Introduction
While AMD is the leading cause of irreversible blindness in the
industrialized world (Klein & Klein, 2004; Maberley et al, 2006;
Wong et al, 2014), the cellular and molecular mechanisms that
precipitate
disease
remain
incompletely
understood
despite
significant genomewide association studies identifying susceptibility
genotypes and target mechanistic pathways (Fritsche et al, 2013,
2016; Sobrin & Seddon, 2014; Black & Clark, 2016). Obesity has long
been suspected as a risk factor for AMD, but increased body mass
index associations with AMD were inconsistent (Zhang et al, 2016).
Using 21,287 participants from the Melbourne Collaborative Cohort
Study, it was recently demonstrated that each increase of 0.1 in
waist/hip ratio (a measure for abdominal obesity) was associated
with a 13% increase in the odds of early AMD and a 75% increase
in the odds of late AMD in men, making obesity the second most
important environmental risk factor for late AMD after cigarette
smoking (Adams et al, 2011).
Progression of AMD is influenced by single or compounded envi-
ronmental and genetic risk factors that lead to persistent low-grade
inflammation and a largely innate immune response (Combadie
`re
et al, 2007; Ambati et al, 2013; Sennlaub et al, 2013). Evidence for
environmental factors predisposing to AMD is supported by the fact
that genetically unrelated individuals with shared long-term envi-
ronmental exposure develop the disease with a concordance of
70.2% (Gottfredsdottir et al, 1999). A consequence of cohabitation
and common lifestyle habits that prospectively impact disease modi-
fiers such as systemic inflammation is microbial exchange (Song
et al, 2013). Given that commensal gut microbiota exert profound
influence on digestion, dietary metabolism, endotoxemia, and
immune responses (Backhed et al, 2005; Turnbaugh et al, 2006;
Cani et al, 2008; Cerf-Bensussan & Gaboriau-Routhiau, 2010), they
are prime candidates to impact chronic low-grade inflammation
(Tremaroli
&
Backhed,
2012).
Microbiota-related
low-grade
inflammation is characterized by elevated pro-inflammatory gene
expression and is a common consequence of an altered host–micro-
biota relationship caused by instigator bacteria or dietary compo-
nents that influence intestinal permeability (Chassaing & Gewirtz,
2014). There is accumulating evidence that asserts the importance
of intestinal permeability, a barrier aspect closely associated with
the intestinal commensal microbiota as well as with the mucosal
immune system, in intestinal and systemic health (Brun et al, 2007;

 Manco et al, 2010; Gerova et al, 2011; Neves et al, 2013; Bischoff
et al, 2014). Heightened intestinal permeability can allow for an
increased translocation of bacterial products such as LPS and other
pathogen-associated molecular pattern molecules (PAMPs) (Cani
et al, 2008; Cerf-Bensussan & Gaboriau-Routhiau, 2010; Mehal,
2013). These PAMPs impact pro-inflammatory signaling through
pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) of the innate immune system,
especially the Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and Nod-like receptors
(NLRs), inducing low-grade systemic inflammation (Chassaing &
Gewirtz, 2014). Microglia, perivascular macrophages, a small
number of dendritic cells, and RPE cells express various PRRs,
including TLRs and NLRs, and may predispose for PAMPs of intesti-
nal origin to impact ocular inflammation (Chen & Xu, 2015). In
addition, bacterial products or metabolites from gut microbiota can
modulate microglia maturation, morphology, and function (Erny
et al, 2015) and activate retina-specific T cells that are thought to
be involved in autoimmune uveitis (Horai et al, 2015).
Dysbiosis in gut microbes is particularly important for the aging
population given that they modulate aging-related changes in innate
immunity, sarcopenia, cognitive function, and frailty in general
(O’Toole & Jeffery, 2015). Here, we sought to evaluate the contribu-
tion of intestinal flora to progression of NV AMD, particularly in the
context of obesity-driven CNV.
Results
High-fat diet modulates gut microbiota and exacerbates CNV
In light of epidemiologic data linking obesity to CNV (Seddon et al,
2003; Zhang et al, 2016), we first investigated the propensity of
diets with elevated fat content to exacerbate CNV. C57BL/6J mice
were raised under sterile barrier conditions and placed on a regular-
chow diet (RD; 16% kcal fat) or high-fat diet (HFD; 60% kcal fat),
from 6 weeks of age (Fig 1A). As expected, upon killing at
13 weeks, HFD-fed mice gained over 50% more weight than control
RD-fed mice (Fig 1B and C). At 11 weeks of life, we subjected mice
to a laser-induced photocoagulation model of CNV, where perfora-
tion of Bruch’s membrane initiates sprouting of subretinal blood
vessels from the choroid, thus mimicking NV AMD (Lambert et al,
2013). Quantification of FITC–dextran-perfused neovessels over
isolectin B4 (IB4)-labeled impact area by confocal imaging 14 days
after laser burn revealed a robust 60% increase in CNV in HFD-fed
mice when compared to RD controls (Fig 1D and E). These experi-
mental mouse data are in line with previously published results
(Sene et al, 2013) and verify human studies (Seddon et al, 2003;
Adams et al, 2011).
To tease out the contribution of gut microbes to heightened CNV
in mice receiving HFD, mice were administered 0.5 g/l of the
broad-spectrum, non-gut permeable (Cani et al, 2008) antibiotic
(AB) neomycin trisulfate salt hydrate orally through their drinking
water. Remarkably, HFD-fed mice treated with neomycin displayed
levels of CNV akin to RD-fed control mice and thus significantly less
than HFD-fed mice receiving vehicle control (Fig 1D and E). Treat-
ment with neomycin did not impact weight gain (Fig 1B and C),
hence uncoupling mouse weight from extent of CNV and strength-
ening the link between gut flora and pathological angiogenesis.
To ascertain that HFD and oral neomycin modify intestinal flora,
we next profiled gut microbiomes. The ratio of Bacteroidetes and
Firmicutes, the two dominant phyla that make up over 90% of
bacterial phylogenetic types in the distal gut (Ley et al, 2006), is
affected by diet (Turnbaugh et al, 2009; David et al, 2014). Compar-
ison of distal gut microbiota from lean and obese individuals shows
that the relative proportion of Bacteroidetes is decreased in obese
individuals compared to lean individuals (Turnbaugh et al, 2006;
David et al, 2014), which is consistent with mouse studies and
underscores that diet impacts intestinal flora (Ley et al, 2006;
Turnbaugh et al, 2006; Hildebrandt et al, 2009). We characterized gut
microbiome composition by sequencing the hypervariable regions
V2, V3, V4, V6, V7, V8, and V9 of bacterial 16S rRNA extracted from
fecal pellets originating from RD-fed and HFD-fed mice receiving
vehicle, as well as HFD-fed and RD-fed mice receiving neomycin
(Figs 1F and EV1). Consistent with clinical data (Ley et al, 2006;
Turnbaugh et al, 2006; Wu et al, 2013), mice on HFD had shifted
ratios of commensal gut microbes. Bacteroidetes/Firmicutes ratios
shifted from 66%/33% of total bacteria in RD to 19%/67% in HFD.
Importantly, oral neomycin restored the proportion of Bacteroidetes
to ~65% of total bacteria and reduced Firmicutes from ~65% to
< 10%. In addition, relative abundance of Proteobacteria (a microbial
signature of dysbiosis in gut microbiota (Wu et al, 2013)) rose with
HFD and further with antibiotic treatment reaching 25% of the popu-
lation (Fig 1G). Of note, HFD-fed mice host the most diverse micro-
biome, with a modest but important presence of Actinobacteria and
Spirochaetes (0.5 and 1.5% of the total). These phyla were

 undetectable in RD-fed mice or after receiving oral neomycin. RD
mice on neomycin showed consistently higher levels of Proteobacteria
at the expense of Firmicutes, confirming microbial shifts with oral
neomycin. Together, these data reconcile that modulation in gut
microbiota correlates with severity of CNV.
High-fat diet potentiates recruitment of microglia and
macrophages during CNV
Mononuclear phagocytes (MPs) such as microglia and macro-
phages contribute to AMD pathogenesis (Ambati et al, 2003b;
Combadiere et al, 2007; Langmann, 2007) and localize to sites of
neovascularization
following
laser-induced
CNV
(Combadie
`re
et al, 2007; Liu et al, 2013; Indaram et al, 2015; Luckoff et al,
2016) (Fig 2A–C). Microglia are CNS-resident macrophages that
are derived from primitive macrophages in the yolk sac (Prinz
et al, 2014). Upon CNS injury, they move to sites of insult and
polarize to
an activated state
and
produce pro-inflammatory
cytokines
(Hanisch
&
Kettenmann,
2007).
Depending
on
the
extent of injury, circulating monocytes may also be recruited from
the bloodstream.
Analysis by FACS of whole retinas and RPE–choroid–sclera
complexes from mice on regular diets revealed a twofold rise in
MPs (Ly6G�, F4/80+, CD11b+) at 3 (p3) and 7 (p7) days post-laser
burn (Fig 2D and E) when compared to non-burned eyes (gating
scheme in Fig EV2A). At day 14 post-burn (p14), the number of
MPs returned to basal levels (Fig 2D and E). A similar kinetic profile
was observed for microglia (Ly6G�, F4/80+, CD11b+, CX3CR1hi
CD45lo) (Fig 2F and G). Notably, the overall proportion of microglia
within the MP population dropped in the first week following laser
burn (p3 and p7), suggesting cellular infiltration from circulation
(Fig EV2B).
Importantly, a HFD potentiated these effects as the heightened
CNV observed in HFD-fed mice (Fig 1D and E) was accompanied by
a ~twofold increase in MPs and microglia at sites of lesion when
compared to control RD-fed mice (Fig 2H–K). This increase in
subretinal MPs persisted at 14 days post-burn as determined by
immunofluorescent quantification of IBA-1+ cells around the laser-
induced lesion (Fig 2L and M). Oral neomycin abrogated this
recruitment (Fig 2H–M), which is consistent with the observed
reduction in CNV (Fig 1D and E). Hence, the intestinal microbiota
of HFD-fed mice augments recruitment of microglia and other MPs
that may be central to disease progression.
Heightened CNV in mice with dysbiosis is accompanied by
increased intestinal permeability, metabolic endotoxemia, and
systemic inflammation
Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) allow the innate immune
system
to
recognize
pathogen-associated
molecular
patterns
(PAMPs) and trigger an inflammatory reaction to fight off the
microbes that produce them (Dorrestein et al, 2014). Although
PAMPs circulate at low concentrations under physiologic conditions
(DiBaise et al, 2012), an increase in LPS concentrations, a condition
termed
“metabolic
endotoxemia”,
may
provoke
low-grade
inflammation (Cani et al, 2008), insulin resistance (Cani et al,
2007), augmented cardiovascular risk (Manco et al, 2010), fatty
liver disease (Brun et al, 2007), white adipose tissue inflammation
(Caesar
et al,
2015),
and
retinopathy
of
prematurity
(ROP)
(Tremblay et al, 2013). In obesity, changes in gut microbiota have
been suggested to compromise barrier function of the epithelial
layer of the gut, thus increasing entry of PAMPs into systemic circu-
lation (Amar et al, 2008; Cani et al, 2008; Osborn & Olefsky, 2012).
Analysis of intestinal permeability by Evans Blue assay revealed
that
HFD
elevated
intestinal
permeability
by
threefold
when
compared to controls (Fig 3A). In our experimental paradigm,
antibiotic treatment did not restore intestinal permeability of HFD-
fed mice as there was no significant difference between HFD-fed
mice and HFD-fed mice that were treated with antibiotics (Fig 3A).
We next determined whether the levels of circulating PAMPS
were sufficient to trigger a PRR response. We therefore subjected
murine macrophages that express several PRRs with a chromosomal
integration of a secreted embryonic alkaline phosphatase reporter
construct inducible by NF-jB and AP-1 (RAW-Blue
TM cells) to serum
from mice under various feeding paradigms. This reports on activa-
tion of PRRs such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs), NOD-like receptors
(NLRs), RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), and C-type lectin receptors
(CLRs).
Serum from HFD-fed mice activated PRRs significantly more read-
ily than serum from RD-fed mice as had been suggested (Cani et al,
2008; Membrez et al, 2008; Neves et al, 2013) or HFD-fed mice
receiving antibiotic treatment (Fig 3B). The reduction in PRR
response in antibiotic-treated mice may occur due to an overall
reduction in the absolute number of bacteria present in the intestine.
We next investigated both systemic and local profiles of classic
inflammatory mediators that are associated with para-inflammation
in AMD (Chen & Xu, 2015). Consistent with the heightened

 activation of PRRs (Fig 3B), serum cytokine concentrations of IL-1b,
IL-6, TNF-a, IL-17A, and IFN-c were significantly induced with HFD,
as was anti-inflammatory IL-10 (Figs 3C and EV3A). Oral intake of
neomycin reversed the trend (Figs 3C and EV3A). Moreover, this
pattern held in naive choroids (without laser-induced CNV) with
transcript levels of Il1b, Il6, and Tnfa as well as with the cardinal
angiogenic factor Vegfa (Fig 3D). Moreover, neomycin treatment of
HFD-fed mice improved their glucose tolerance (Fig EV3B and C)
suggesting a general improvement in metabolic health, an important
risk factor for AMD (Ghaem Maralani et al, 2015), and confirming
efficient modulation of gut microbes (Cani et al, 2007). These data
suggest that HFD primes choroids for CNV in a gut flora-dependent
manner, where dysbiosis of the gut microbial community results in
alterations of circulating levels of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytoki-
nes and the expression of inflammation-associated mRNAs.

 suspension of HFD microbiota (HFDxHFDT) served as controls
(Fig 4A). Prior to microbiotal transplantation, recipient mice were
treated with ampicillin and neomycin in drinking water to deplete
their original commensal microbiome. Gavage with cecal microbiota
was repeated on a weekly basis to maintain a constant composition
of the transplanted flora (Fig 4B). Although mice on HFD were
significantly heavier than those on RD, microbiotal transfer from
RD-fed mice did not significantly alter weight gain of HFD-fed mice
and thus permitted to uncouple the effects of weight gain from those
of microbial transfer (Fig 4C and D).
To verify successful transplantation of diet-associated microbial
phyla, we characterized fecal microbiota as above (Figs 4E and EV4A).
In RDxRDT mice, Bacteroidetes were the most abundant phylum
representing 75–80% of the microbiome while accounting for only
35% in HFDxHFDT mice where Firmicutes and Proteobacteria filled
the balance. Transfer of RD microbiota to HFD-fed mice restored
microbial proportions found in RD-fed mice (Fig 4F). In addition,
improved glucose tolerance in HFDxRDT mice compared to HFDxHFDT
mice attests to successful microbiotal transplants (Fig EV4B and C).
While HFDxHFDT showed a ~twofold increase in CNV when
compared to RDxRDT, transfer of RD microbiota to HFD-fed mice
diminished CNV by ~35% supporting a role for gut microbiota in
pathological CNV (Fig 4G and H). In addition, our data attest to
intestinal permeability being lowered through microbiotal transfer.
Whereas HFDxHFDT mice show twofold higher levels of serum Evans
Blue compared to RDxRDT, transfer of RD microbiota to HFD-fed mice
reduced permeability to levels seen in RDxRDT mice (Fig 4I). Analysis
of choroidal levels of Il6, Tnfa, and Vegfa confirmed that transfer of
RD-fed fecal suspensions to HFD mice reduced overall inflammation
(Fig 4J). Il1b transcripts were not affected. In concert, these results
provide evidence for the influence of gut microbiota on CNV.
Discussion
With an increasing prevalence of obesity and increasing life expec-
tancy, the societal impact and financial burden of AMD are expected
to rise dramatically in the coming years (Friedman et al, 2004; Rein
et al, 2006). Polymorphisms in genes implicated in inflammation
predispose to AMD (Hageman et al, 2005) with strong linkage to
single nucleotide polymorphisms in CFH factors, CFHR (CFH-related
factors), ARMS2, VEGFA, and TGFBR1 (Ambati et al, 2003a; Klein
et al, 2005; Yu et al, 2011; Ratnapriya & Chew, 2013), yet by them-
selves, no single mutation can account for disease development. To
date, the contribution of our “second genome” (the microbiome)
has not been investigated. Our study suggests that gut microbiota
influences development of neovascular lesions associated with AMD
and this is particularly when obesity is a predisposing factor. We
show that diets rich in fat alter the gut microbiome and in turn
elevate choroidal and systemic inflammation and heighten patholog-
ical choroidal neovascularization. This effect could originate from
increased intestinal permeability to PAMPs secondary to dysbiosis
(Fig 5). In this regard, obesity-related changes in gut microbiota
have been shown to decrease barrier function of the gut, allowing
increased entry of PAMPs into systemic circulation and conse-
quently triggering inflammation (Amar et al, 2008; Cani et al, 2008;
Osborn & Olefsky, 2012). Both antibiotic treatment and microbiotal
transplants
from
RD-fed
mice
lower
systemic
and
choroidal
inflammation, yet only RD-microbiotal transplants significantly
lower intestinal permeability. While the microbial community of
HFDxRDT mice resembles the one of RD-fed mice more closely than
that of HFD-fed mice treated with antibiotics, the effects of
neomycin treatment likely occur through a decrease in the absolute
number of bacteria present in the gut.
Modifying microbiota can reduce systemic and local choroidal
inflammation and attenuate pathological neovascularization. Of
note, one of the most heavily regulated inflammatory cytokines in
our experimental paradigms was IL-6. Elevated levels of IL-6 are
associated with early (Klein et al, 2014) and late AMD (Klein et al,
2008) and are significantly related to smoking, higher body mass
index, and “inflammaging”, the low-grade, chronic, systemic sterile
inflammation in aging, in the absence of infection (Franceschi &
Campisi, 2014). Dysbiosis of gut flora may thus be an additional
factor
that

 individuals subjected to dietary interventions designed to stall
progression of AMD such as AREDS formulations (Age-Related Eye
Disease Study Research Group 2001; Age-Related Eye Disease Study
2 Research Group 2013). In addition, from an experimental perspec-
tive, our study strengthens the notion that housing and dietary
considerations must be taken into account when designing animal-
based studies on angiogenesis and aging. Gut microbiota is acquired
shortly after birth from the surrounding environment, forming a
relatively stable community that can shift composition under influ-
ence of environmental factors such as diet, exercise, and medication
(Turnbaugh et al, 2009; David et al, 2014; Evans et al, 2014). Modi-
fying gut microbiomes may thus provide minimally intrusive and
cost-effective paradigms to prevent or delay exudative AMD.
Materials and Methods
Animals
All animal procedures were validated by the Animal Care Commit-
tee of the University of Montreal and Ho
ˆpital Maisonneuve-Rose-
mont in accordance with the guidelines established by the Canadian
Council on Animal Care.
Briefly, 6-week-old male C57BL/6 WT mice, purchased from The
Jackson Laboratory, raised under sterile barrier conditions and
housed under a 12-h light cycle with water and food ad libitum were
placed on either a regular-chow diet (RD) (16% kcal fat, 63% kcal
carbohydrate, 21% kcal protein) or a high-fat diet (HFD) (60% kcal
Figure 5.
High-fat diet-induced dysbiosis increases intestinal permeability, metabolic endotoxemia, and systemic and local inflammation and ultimately
contributes to CNV.
The ratio of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes, the two dominant phyla in intestinal flora, decreases significantly in high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice compared to regular-chow diet
(RD)-fed mice, with a relative increase in Firmicutes in HFD-fed mice and decrease in Bacteroidetes. This dysbiosis is accompanied by heightened intestinal permeability,
which allows increased translocation of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) (endotoxemia). Recognition of these microbe-specific molecules by pattern recognition
receptors (PRRs) present on innate immune cells triggers synthesis and excretion of cytokines causing chronic systemic low-grade inflammation. Ultimately, this exacerbates CNV.

 fat, 26% kcal carbohydrate, 14% kcal protein) for 7 weeks and
weighed weekly to register weight gain. At the age of 9 weeks, half
of the RD and half of the HFD mice received antibiotic treatment
with 0.5 g/l neomycin trisulfate salt hydrate in their drinking
water, resulting in four different experimental groups: Control (RD),
Antibiotics (RD+AB), High-Fat (HFD), and High-Fat + Antibiotics
(HFD+AB). Neomycin is not absorbed from the gut (Cani et al,
2008); therefore, the antibiotic treatment was isolated to the GI tract
and had no direct systemic effect.
At the age of 13 weeks, fecal pellets and blood were collected
before sedation with isoflurane gas and cervical dislocation. Eyes
were enucleated, dissected, and stored at �80°C for mRNA extraction.
Laser-induced CNV
At the age of 11 weeks, mice were anesthetized with 10 ll/g body
weight of a 10% ketamine and 4% xylazine solution, and their
Bruch’s membrane was ruptured using an argon laser as described
previously (Lambert et al, 2013). Two weeks after CNV induction,
the mice were perfused with 0.5 ml of 15 mg/ml of fluorescein
isothiocyanate (FITC)–dextran (average mol wt 20,000) and killed.
Eyes were enucleated and processed for analysis by immunohisto-
chemistry. The sclera–choroid–RPE cell complex was mounted onto
a slide, and the burns and macrophages were photographed with an
Olympus FV1000 microscope. The neovascularization was captured
in a Z-stack, and the lesion caused by the laser impact was captured
in a single-plane image. The Z-stacks were compressed into one
image, and the FITC–dextran-labeled neovascular area and the area
of the lesion were measured per lesion in ImageJ.
Immunohistochemistry
Eyes were fixed for 30 min in 4% PFA at room temperature, before
dissection
of
the
sclera–choroid–RPE
cell
complex.
After
a
secondary fixation of 15 min in 4% PFA at room temperature, the
choroids were stained with rhodamine-labeled Griffonia (Ban-
deiraea) Simplicifolia Lectin I (Vector Laboratories Inc.) in 1 mM
CaCl2 in PBS and IBA-1 (rabbit polyclonal; Wako).
Microbiome sequencing
DNA was extracted from fecal pellets with the Qiagen QIAamp Fast
Stool Mini Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions with
several small modifications; briefly, 2–3 fecal pellets were homoge-
nized in 500 ll InhibitEX Buffer using a disposable homogenizing
pestle and vortex. The suspension was heated for 5 min at 70°C
before stool particles were pelleted by 1-min centrifugation at
20,000 g. The supernatant was thoroughly mixed with 20 ll protei-
nase K before 500 ll Buffer AL was added and the mix was incu-
bated at 70°C for 10 min. After the addition of 500 ll of 100%
ethanol, the lysate was applied to the QIAamp spin column and
centrifuged for 1 min at 20,000 g. The filtrate was discarded before
500 ll Buffer AW1 was added to the spin column and centrifuged
for 1 min at 20,000 g. This step was repeated with 500 ll Buffer
AW2. The spin column was dried by centrifugation for 3 min at
20,000 g in a clean 2-ml collection tube. The DNA was eluted in
200 ll of Buffer ATE, directly pipetted on the QIAamp membrane,
and collected in a clean Eppendorf tube.
After DNA extraction from the fecal pellets, the Thermo Fisher
Ion 16S
TM Metagenomics Kit was used to amplify the hypervariable
regions V2, V3, V4, V6, V7, V8, and V9 of bacterial 16S rRNA. The
amplified fragments were then bar-coded, sequenced on the Ion
PGM sequencer system, and analyzed with the Ion Reporter
Software.
FACS
Retinas and sclera–choroid–RPE cell complexes of non-burned and
burned mice at p3, p7, and p14 were cut into small pieces and
homogenized in a solution of 750 U/ml DNase I (Sigma-Aldrich
Corp., St. Louis, MO, USA) and 0.5 mg/ml of collagenase D (Roche,
Basel, Switzerland) for 20 min at 37°C. Homogenates were filtered
through a 70-lm cell strainer and washed in PBS. Viability of the
cells was checked by Zombie Aqua (423101: Biolegend) staining for
15 min at room temperature. After incubation with LEAF-purified
anti-mouse CD16/32 (101310; BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA) for
15 min at room temperature to block Fc receptors, cells were incu-
bated for 25 min at 4°C with the following antibodies: Alexa Fluor
700 anti-mouse CD45.2 (109821; BioLegend), BV711 anti-mouse/
human CD11b (101241; BioLegend), APC/CY7 anti-mouse Ly-6G

(FAB5825P; R&D Systems, Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA). Fluores-
cence-activated cell sorting (FACS) was performed on a BD LSRFor-
tessa
TM X-20 cell analyzer, and data were analyzed using FlowJo
software (version 7.6.5; FlowJo, Ashland, OR, USA).
Intestinal permeability assay
Mice were injected by oral gavage with 1 ml of 50 mg/ml Evans
Blue divided over five injections, 30 min apart. After 24 h, 120 ll of
blood was collected from the submandibular vein. Serum was
analyzed for Evans Blue concentration with a spectrophotometer at
an optical density of 620–740 nm and quantified with the help of a
standard dilution curve.
RAW-blue assay
Blood was collected through cardiac puncture, and serum was
stored at �80°C until use in the RAW-Blue assay. PAMPs were
assayed

vation 30 ll of mouse serum, 30 ll of FBS(�control) or 30 ll of
FBS+LPS (+ control) was added per well and cells were incubated
for 21 h at 37°C under an atmosphere of 5% CO2/95% air. SEAP
levels were determined using a spectrophotometer at 620–655 nm
after a 1- to 3-h incubation at 37°C of 20 ll of induced RAW-
Blue
TM cell supernatant with 180 ll QUANTI-Blue

 Cytokine assessment
Serum cytokine assays were performed using a Bio-plex Mouse
Cytokine 6-plex panel (1 × 96-well) (Bio-Rad) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. The Bio-Plex cytokine assay is a multi-
plex bead-based assay involving matrices that is designed to quanti-
tate multiple cytokines as follows. The wells of a 96-well plate were
pre-wet with 100 ll of Bio-Plex assay buffer. 50 ll of vortexed
multiplex bead working solution was pipetted into each well and
immediately removed. Wells were washed twice with the Bio-Plex
wash buffer before 25 ll of vortexed Bio-Plex Detention Antibody
working solution was added to each well and incubated for 30 min.
After a triple wash with the Bio-Plex wash buffer, 50 ll of vortexed
1× streptavidin-PE was added to each well and incubated for
30 min. After three washes, the beads in each well were resus-
pended with 125 ll of Bio-Plex assay buffer and vortexed for 30 s,
and the plate was immediately read on the Bio-Plex system. Cyto-
kine concentrations were calculated from the standard curve by the
use of Bio-Plex manager software. Samples were run in duplicate.
Real-time PCR analysis
After enucleation eyes were dissected to isolate retinas and sclera–
choroid–RPE cell complex. RNA was isolated using TRIzol and
digested with DNase I to prevent amplification of genomic DNA
contaminants. M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies) was
used for the reversed transcription, and SYBR Green (Bio-Rad) to
determine gene expression in an ABI Biosystems Real-Time PCR
machine with b-actin (Actb) as a reference gene. We used the
following primers: Mouse Actb = F: 50-GAC GGC CAG GTC ATC

Microbiota transplant
A litter of six C57BL/6 WT mice was divided over three cages, repre-
senting three experimental groups: regular-chow diet-fed mice
receiving a transplant from regular-chow diet-fed mice (RDxRDT),
high-fat diet-fed mice receiving a transplant from high-fat diet-fed
mice (HFDxHFDT), and high-fat-fed mice receiving a transplant
from regular-chow diet-fed mice (HFDxRDT). At the age of 6 weeks,
two cages were started on HFD, while the other cage remained on a
regular-chow diet. Mice received antibiotics (ampicillin 1.0 g/l +
neomycin 0.5 g/l) in their drinking water for 5 days, to deplete the
original gut microbiota, as described before (Ellekilde et al, 2014).
Two days after discontinuing the antibiotics, they received their first
microbiota transplant, from mice on either a regular-chow diet or a
high-fat diet.
Feces were collected from 20 different donor mice, either on RD
or on HFD for at least 5 weeks. The fecal pallets were collected in
2.5 ml of sterile PBS with 0.05% cysteine HCL, homogenized, and
centrifuged at 200 g for 5 min. 200 ll of the supernatant was
introduced orally to the mice with the help of flexible gavage
needles. This was repeated with fresh fecal samples every 7 days
for the duration of the experiment. At the age of 11 weeks, mice
were subjected to four laser burns per eye. Mice were weighed
weekly and feces were collected for analysis by 16S sequencing.
Mice are coprophagic, and hence, care is taken to isolate individuals
with given gut microbiota modifying protocols.
Glucose tolerance test (GTT)
Mice were starved for 12 h overnight. Blood glucose was measured
(Accu-Chek; Roche) at baseline and 15, 30, 60, 120, and 240 min
following intraperitoneal injection of 2 mg/kg of 10% D-glucose.
Statistical analysis
Results are presented as mean � SEM. GraphPad Prism version
6.00 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA; www.graphpad.com) was
used to analyze the statistical significance of differences by one-way
ANOVA and Tukey’s multiple comparisons test or a two-tailed
Student’s t-test, where appropriate. Data with P < 0.05 were consid-
ered statistically different: *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, and ***P < 0.001.

Problem
Age-related macular degeneration in its neovascular form (NV AMD) is
the leading cause of vision loss among adults above the age of 60.
Epidemiological data suggest that in men, overall abdominal obesity
is the second most important environmental risk factor after smoking
for progression to late-stage NV AMD. To date, the mechanisms that
underscore this observation remain ill-defined. Given the impact of
high-fat diets on gut microbiota, we investigated whether commensal
microbes influence the evolution of AMD.
Results
Using mouse models of NV AMD, microbiotal transplants and other
paradigms that modify the gut microbiome, we uncoupled weight
gain from confounding factors and demonstrate that high-fat diets
exacerbate choroidal neovascularization (CNV) by altering gut micro-
biota. Gut dysbiosis leads to heightened intestinal permeability and
chronic low-grade inflammation with elevated production of IL-6,
IL-1b, TNF-a and VEGF-A that ultimately exacerbate pathological
angiogenesis.
Impact
With an increasing prevalence of obesity and increasing life expec-
tancy, the societal impact and financial burden of AMD are expected
to rise dramatically in the coming years. Our study suggests that gut
microbiota influences development of neovascular lesions associated
with AMD, particularly when obesity is a predisposing factor. Modify-
ing microbiota can reduce systemic and local choroidal inflammation
and attenuate pathological neovascularization and may thus provide
minimally intrusive and cost-effective paradigms to prevent or delay
exudative AMD.
