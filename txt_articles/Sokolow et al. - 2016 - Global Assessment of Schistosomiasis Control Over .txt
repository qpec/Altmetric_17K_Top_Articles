Abstract
Background
Despite control efforts, human schistosomiasis remains prevalent throughout Africa, Asia,
and South America. The global schistosomiasis burden has changed little since the new
anthelmintic drug, praziquantel, promised widespread control.
Methodology
We evaluated large-scale schistosomiasis control attempts over the past century and
across the globe by identifying factors that predict control program success: snail control
(e.g., molluscicides or biological control), mass drug administrations (MDA) with praziquan-
tel, or a combined strategy using both. For data, we compiled historical information on con-
trol tactics and their quantitative outcomes for all 83 countries and territories in which: (i)
schistosomiasis was allegedly endemic during the 20th century, and (ii) schistosomiasis
remains endemic, or (iii) schistosomiasis has been "eliminated," or is "no longer endemic,"
or transmission has been interrupted.
Principal Findings
Widespread snail control reduced prevalence by 92 ± 5% (N = 19) vs. 37 ± 7% (N = 29) for
programs using little or no snail control. In addition, ecological, economic, and political fac-
tors contributed to schistosomiasis elimination. For instance, snail control was most

century.
Conclusions/Significance
Snail control has been the most effective way to reduce schistosomiasis prevalence.
Despite evidence that snail control leads to long-term disease reduction and elimination,
most current schistosomiasis control efforts emphasize MDA using praziquantel over snail
control. Combining drug-based control programs with affordable snail control seems the
best strategy for eliminating schistosomiasis.
Author Summary
Schistosomiasis is a parasitic disease infecting more than 250 million people worldwide,
with almost 800 million at risk. Over the past century, nations undertook schistosomiasis
control programs, with outcomes varying from little effect to elimination. The biggest
hope for elimination began about 40 years ago with the discovery of the antischistosomal
drug praziquantel, after which snail control was seen as old fashioned. Here, we review
control program outcomes over the past 100 years across all major schistosomiasis
endemic zones, including Africa, Asia, and the Americas. We screened for differences in
long-term schistosomiasis reductions among countries and found the most successful pro-
grams focused on transmission control (most often snail control, with or without engi-
neering interventions), sometimes in tandem with praziquantel. Although praziquantel
has important human-health benefits, our results suggest old-fashioned snail control has
been the key to schistosomiasis elimination.
Introduction
Can we do better at controlling schistosomiasis? Despite effective drug treatment options and
large-scale drug distribution programs, most endemic areas have not yet achieved satisfactory
schistosomiasis control. Today, schistosomiasis remains prevalent in Africa, Asia, and South
America where trends over time forecast perpetual endemicity. Sometimes, endemicity has
been because poverty constrains control efforts; otherwise, endemicity is due to failed or inef-
fective control attempts. With more than 250 million people still infected and elimination
stalled [1,2], the World Health Assembly (WHA) called for researching and applying comple-
mentary, non-pharmaceutical control strategies for eliminating schistosomiasis in its 2012
resolution 65.21 [3]. This resolution ignited debate over the best strategies for eliminating
schistosomiasis [4–9]. To add quantitative data to this debate, we evaluated schistosomiasis
control strategies over the past century and screened for factors associated with elimination or
long-term prevalence reductions.
Human schistosomiasis occurs where aquatic (or amphibious) intermediate host snails shed
infective Schistosoma spp. cercariae that penetrate human skin upon contact. Infected humans
suffer from anemia, stunted growth, cognitive impairment, fatigue, infertility, and sometimes,
liver fibrosis or bladder cancer [10]. Most affected people live in poverty where there are few
resources for research and control [11].
Schistosomiasis control efforts aim to disrupt the parasite’s complex life cycle (Fig 1): sanita-
tion stops parasite eggs in urine or feces from moving into aquatic snail habitats; snail control

 reduces intermediate host density (parasite larvae reproduce asexually in snails); education (or
“information education and communication”; IEC) helps people avoid high-risk water contacts
and know when to seek treatment; and drugs—given as mass drug administrations (MDA),
targeted treatment campaigns (“test-and-treat” or TAT), or through health services—kill the
adult worm in the human host, with immediate and long-term health benefits for infected indi-
viduals [12]. Such efforts seem simple, but implementation often fails for economic or political
reasons.
Consensus on the “best” schistosomiasis control strategy has varied over the past century.
Early Egyptian control efforts around the turn of the 20th century treated human infection,
then shifted toward borehole latrines as a sanitary measure in the 1930s, but with little success
[13]. In the 1940s the focus shifted again, this time toward snail control using copper sulfate
[13]. Control strategy recommendations by the World Health Organization (WHO) then
emphasized integrated control measures, including clean water access, sanitation, snail control,
health education, and health services, in addition to drug treatments [12]. In the late 1970s and
early 1980s –after praziquantel became the drug-of-choice for treating schistosomiasis [14]–
the integrated approach was often supplanted by chemotherapy via MDA. Praziquantel is safe
and effective against adult schistosomes [15], but is ineffective against juvenile worms [16–18],
and drug treatment does not prevent reinfection [19–23]. Nonetheless, large-scale research
projects and influential modeling results suggested that widespread drug treatment (best when
coupled with sanitation measures) would reduce schistosomiasis more than other interventions
[24–27]. MDA increased in the 1990s after generic (inexpensive) praziquantel became available
[15,28]. Thus, in 2001, the WHA endorsed preventive chemotherapy as the primary strategy to

 control schistosomiasis through reducing morbidity associated with high worm burdens [29].
Specifically, Engels et al. [30] summarized the modern, WHO-recommended schistosomiasis
global control strategy as MDA in high-transmission areas to reduce morbidity and transmis-
sion reduction in low-transmission areas (Fig 2a).
Although MDA is now the most popular control strategy, some have argued that snail con-
trol is more effective [5,6,31–33]. However, a Center for Global Development working group
focused on successful global health interventions points out: “We don’t know enough about
what’s worked because scaled up programs are rarely evaluated systematically” [34]. Here,
using objective criteria and a quantitative analysis to test for commonalities among successful
control programs, we find snail control has been effective at reducing schistosomiasis.
Methods
Defining Success
We evaluated control programs for all areas around the world with active (autochthonous)
human schistosomiasis transmission at some time in the 20th century. We considered countries
with little to no control effort as having minimal control. However if minimal control corre-
sponded to a loss of schistosomiasis, we defined the outcome as fortuitous elimination. We
defined control as not (yet) successful where (i) control has been incomplete, (ii) transmission
continues, or (iii) the disease has been almost, but not yet, eliminated. We defined control as
successful for active programs that were reported to have stopped local transmission (i.e., elimi-
nation or becoming “non-endemic”) in WHO reports or peer-reviewed assessments (e.g.,
[9,35]). “Elimination” implies reducing disease incidence to zero in a particular area [30,36].
There is some inconsistency in the literature on the term “eradication,” which often refers to
global disease extirpation [37]. With respect to schistosomiasis, this has been applied to the
regional elimination achieved by Japan. Here, because elimination, “eradication,” and non-
endemicity all imply no local transmission, we treated these designations as successful.
Countries and Territories Evaluated
Our goal was to evaluate control success in all countries and territories with endemic schisto-
somiasis during the 20th century. We began with the nine countries often cited as “success
stories” for schistosomiasis elimination: Iran, Japan, Lebanon, Malaysia, Martinique, Mont-
serrat, Thailand, Tunisia, and Turkey [38]. Antigua, Jordan, and Morocco were three other
potential “successes” [35,39]. We were also interested in countries that achieved great reduc-
tions in schistosomiasis prevalence including Brazil, China, the Philippines, and Egypt.

 Additional literature searches focused on characterizing disease and control history for all
additional countries with: (i) historical disease data and (ii) recorded national- or territory-
level schistosomiasis control programs. Although we found relevant data for most countries,
data were contradictory for several Caribbean islands such as Guadeloupe and Dominican
Republic, with some reports indicating elimination and others claiming ongoing risk. We
considered these countries to be “not (yet) successful.” For several in-conflict countries such
as Chad and Syria, current schistosomiasis prevalence is “unknown”, with the potential for
conflict and political unrest to hinder control [40].
Data Collection
We obtained country-specific data for several categories (S1 Table) by reading peer-reviewed
published sources as well as non-peer-reviewed reports accessed through online (or hard copy)
repositories, including PubMed, ISI Web of Science, Google Scholar, WHO, United Nations
(UN), World Bank, United States Agency for International Development, and the UN Food and
Agriculture Organization (see S1 Appendix for complete reference list). From these sources, we
assessed 77 countries and six semi-autonomous territories (including Western Sahara in north-
ern Africa, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Montserrat, Puerto Rico, and Zanzibar).
For each country, we collected information on schistosomiasis, control efforts, parasite
life cycles, environmental factors, and economics. We focused on variables related to national
schistosomiasis data (country- or territory-wide prevalence, infected population size, at-risk
population size) and details about the control strategies implemented and their time-course.
We also recorded snail and schistosome species present; island or mainland geography; and
per-capita gross domestic product (GDP) in 2013 and in all years for which schistosomiasis
disease data were available in each country. Further, we noted site-specific factors that might
alter disease outcomes or resources for control activities (S1 Table). We limited the preva-
lence information, in almost every case, to country-level (or territory-level) statistics. Only
for Japan, where finer scale data were available over many years, did we use large-scale and
long-term regional data to assess trends, and we included only the data from the largest
endemic area (the Kofu basin) in the statistical analyses. We were careful to avoid small-
scale, focal studies on prevalence that might not represent the whole country. We treated
countries/territories as replicates in statistical analyses done in JMP Pro version 12 [41] and
R version 3.1.2 [42].
Statistics
To test the general hypothesis that control programs can eliminate schistosomiasis, we assessed
whether schistosomiasis was eliminated/non-endemic using a logistic regression, with five pre-
dictors for 68 countries/territories (excluding 15 that lacked enough data or were designated
non-endemic to begin with): (i) the presence/absence of a national- or territory-level control
program; (ii) status as a mainland or island (because it should be easier to achieve elimination
with more isolation); (iii) the total human population infected with schistosomiasis at baseline,
or before control began (because it might be harder to eliminate schistosomiasis when the start-
ing infected population is large); (iv) the current fraction of people with access to improved
water sources (as a proxy for contemporary water, sanitation, and hygiene conditions, World
Bank Development Indicators, 2012 [43]); and (v) contemporary per-capita GDP (as a proxy
for “wealth” status, World Bank Development Indicators, 2013 [44]; S2 Table). Using 68 coun-
tries gave us considerable statistical power to evaluate when and where control has been effec-
tive in eliminating schistosomiasis.

 We next compared how well different control strategies reduced disease. The strategies used
in historical schistosomiasis control efforts were categorized as: MDA, snail control, or engi-
neering interventions (e.g., sanitation infrastructure, cement lined canals, drained wetlands).
Each control category was further sorted according to our best estimate (based on qualitative
descriptions, or sometimes, quantitative reports): extensive/complete (>70% of the population/
area in need received treatment), intermediate (>30%), or focal to none (<30%). Although dis-
ease can be measured as intensity [45,46] (as indicated by patient egg output), there was not
enough published national-level data to assess intensity means and variances. Therefore, we
compared disease prevalence on a continuous scale (0 to 100% based on the schistosomiasis
national prevalence at each available time point for each country/territory). We included only
countries with national control programs and enough longitudinal disease data. We excluded
those countries/territories with no coordinated control effort (“Minimal control” in Table 1,
Fig 3). Further, among national control programs, we designated the category “low coverage”
where snail control, or MDA, or both were included, but the program achieved low (<30%)
coverage for either strategy. Similarly, engineering controls were considered present only
where their coverage was high (i.e. where more than 30% coverage was achieved).
To test the hypothesis that control strategies differed in their ability to reduce prevalence,
we used a quantitative generalized linear mixed model (GLMM, function “glmer” from the R
package “lme4” ([42], S2 Table). The statistical model assessed what factors best predicted rela-
tive change in prevalence over time for the 44 countries that applied concerted control and had
quantitative, longitudinal data on prevalence, control strategies and covariates (more details
below and in S2 Table). This GLMM considered country as a random effect (to account for the
repeated measures over time within each country) and the following fixed effects: (i) control
program duration (to test if longer efforts might be more successful); (ii) a country’s status as
an island or mainland; (iii) initial prevalence before control began (to account for the control
effort needed); (iv) the percentage of the population with access to improved water sources
(World Bank Indicators, 2012 [43]); and (v) the inflation-adjusted per capita GDP over time
(recorded at each time point with disease data from The Maddison-Project [47]). We were
most interested in the interaction terms between the predictors and time [year], which, if sig-
nificant, would indicate an effect on prevalence reduction or increase over time. We first
assembled a “full model” that contained all predictors and interaction terms, and then used a
model selection procedure based on Akaike’s information criterion (AIC) to remove each
interaction term in turn to find the best balance between parsimony and fit to the data ([48], S3
Table).
After analyzing what control strategies were most successful, we became curious about the
factors that might have determined which control strategies a country used. To that end, we
assessed the correlations between the control strategies used and a country’s “wealth” status
(per-capita GDP for each country at each time-point) as well as the control era (the year each
national- or territory-level control program began).
Results
The response to schistosomiasis varied across the 83 evaluated countries/territories. Seventy-
two countries and five territories were “endemic” for schistosomiasis during the 20th century
(whereas four were probably “never endemic,” and two had too little data to determine their
historical or contemporary schistosomiasis endemicity; Table 1, Fig 3). Only 51 (66%) of
endemic countries/territories had coordinated national- or territory-level schistosomiasis con-
trol during the past century, whereas the remaining 26 (34%) had no verifiable programs
(despite some having small pilot programs; Table 1, Figs 3 and 4). Nine endemic countries/

 territories—Iran, Japan, Jordan, Lebanon, Martinique, Mauritius, Morocco, Puerto Rico, and
Tunisia—applied coordinated control programs and achieved “success” as we defined it here.
Nine countries/territories that have not yet achieved schistosomiasis elimination achieved a
90% or greater reduction in their country-level prevalence since baseline (before control):
China, Egypt, Guadeloupe, Indonesia, Iraq, Philippines, Saudi Arabia, St. Lucia, and Venezuela.
The remaining countries had variable schistosomiasis prevalence over the past century
(Table 1), depending, in part, on their control strategy.

 Elimination Predictors
Counter to expectations, elimination/non-endemicity was not associated with having a control
program. This unexpected result was due to two factors: several countries/territories achieved
“fortuitous” elimination without any documented control effort (Antigua, Djibouti, Malaysia,
Montserrat, Thailand, and Turkey) and several other countries failed to eliminate schistosomi-
asis, despite substantial prevalence reductions. Island/mainland did not predict elimination sta-
tus (Table 2), however, our inclusion of population size, which is higher on continents and
makes elimination harder, could have co-varied with a mainland-island effect. Possessing
greater “wealth” (indicated by a higher contemporary per capita GDP) did not affect elimina-
tion. Elimination was, however, more likely where more people can access improved water
sources. In summary, achieving elimination was idiosyncratic. It was easier with smaller
infected populations and in countries with improved (safer) water sources. Although many
programs have failed to eliminate schistosomiasis, sometimes elimination has occurred without
a coordinated control program. Below, we discuss what factors in addition to control programs
could affect schistosomiasis prevalence reductions and elimination success.
Effective Control Strategies—Quantitative Outcomes
Although fortuitous elimination in several countries confounded our ability to assess whether
control programs eliminated schistosomiasis, many areas with control programs experienced
durable prevalence reductions. A program’s effectiveness (i.e., the prevalence reduction rate)
depended strongly on strategy type and coverage and weakly on the intercept (prevalence at
baseline). Applying snail control, MDA, or both—with at least intermediate (>30%) coverage
—worked better than any programs with low coverage. Snail control programs (primarily mol-
lusciciding and biological control using non-native, competitor snails) showed the strongest
prevalence reductions (while accounting for other covariates, including: control duration [in
years], country “wealth” [as per capita GDP in each year with disease data], and access to
improved water sources; Table 3, Figs 5 and 6). In other words, all else being equal, prevalence
reduction was highest with snail control at intermediate or better coverage.
Although engineering controls (e.g., installing sanitation infrastructure, cementing canals,
building bridges, or draining wetlands), were almost always accompanied by snail control,
about half of the programs using snail control did not use engineering in their control pro-
grams. Programs that used MDA as a primary strategy (without snail control) also did not
report using any large-scale engineering controls. The presence or absence and extent of engi-
neering controls showed weak effects on prevalence, and including 3-way interactions with this
variable—along with the other control strategies and time—in the quantitative statistical model
did not improve model fit to the data (based on AIC; S3 Table). Thus, engineering controls,

 although perhaps beneficial within some integrated programs, did not consistently reduce
schistosomiasis prevalence.
Population size affected control success. As expected, prevalence reductions were impaired
where there were larger initial infected human populations, but this relationship differed
among the control strategies. Snail control programs (with or without MDA) were less sensitive
to initial infected human population size, than were other approaches (Fig 7).
Wealth and Era Effects
Control strategy depended on country wealth and the year in which control began. Richer
countries (measured by inflation-adjusted, per-capita GDP) tended to begin their control pro-
grams earlier in the 20th century, with a stronger focus on snail control and greater success (Fig
8). Higher wealth was also correlated with greater access to improved (safer) water sources.
Large-scale MDA programs were rare before praziquantel entered the global market in the
1980s. After this turning point, there was a new option (using both MDA and snail control)
and this integrated strategy has been used since the 1980s in places like China, Egypt, and Bra-
zil. Countries that began their control programs even more recently (after the 1990s or 2000s)
were poorer and tended either to focus on MDA or achieved poor coverage (designated as “low
coverage” in Fig 8).
Discussion
Our results support recent suggestions that snail control is key to schistosomiasis reduction
[5,6,49]. Such an effect has been anticipated. In 1985, a lead researcher of the Caribbean
“St. Lucia Project,”–a Rockefeller-funded schistosomiasis control study—wrote, “chemother-
apy is now assuming the major role in control programmes, but in most. . . a reservoir of
infection inevitably remains. Transmission is thus likely to continue at a low, but probably
increasing level unless a supplementary control strategy is present” [24]. Unfortunately, it took
decades to assess this prediction.
Chemotherapy has major benefits for infected humans, but, by itself, MDA has done little
to curb re-infection. Although programs limited to MDA with praziquantel did not appear to

 do as well as the other strategies evaluated, the (targeted) chemotherapy for infection control
remains an undeniable factor in improving health, especially when integrated with snail con-
trol. Countries whose programs focused on snail control often relied on distributing chemo-
therapy through means other than MDA, such as Morocco’s successful test-and-treat (TAT)
campaigns using mobile teams [50], Iraq’s early school-based TAT programs [51], and Japan’s
involvement as an early TAT site for praziquantel beginning in the late 1970s. This involve-
ment might have carried Japan to country-wide elimination by 1996 [52]. One reason prazi-
quantel seems less effective than expected is that it was applied later in history when control
campaigns targeted more challenging countries. In other words, schistosomiasis elimination
was more successful among programs started before praziquantel reached the global market
than among those programs started after the drug’s introduction in the late 1970s. This might
arise, in part, because wealthier countries tended to address the disease earlier in the 20th cen-
tury, as they could afford molluscicides for widespread snail control (although inexpensive bio-
logical control also sometimes succeeded).
The “fortuitous elimination” of schistosomiasis from Antigua, Djibouti, Malaysia, Montser-
rat, Thailand, and Turkey without documented control efforts suggests cryptic factors have
affected schistosomiasis, including: species invasions (e.g. snail competitors or predators), sani-
tation or health care improvements outside control programs, and human-induced or natural
ecosystem changes (such as changes in dams, irrigated-agriculture, and urbanization). The
least fortuitous of the fortuitous eliminations was the 1995 volcanic eruption that drove almost
half of Montserrat’s population off the island and made the schistosomiasis transmission zones
off limits to people [53,54]. (See S2 Appendix and S1 Fig for more cryptic schistosomiasis con-
trol examples).
These results suggest that programs have been most effective when snail control is coordi-
nated soon thereafter—or simultaneously—with chemotherapy (morbidity control) via a

 rational progression from widespread, active drug distribution campaigns (MDA or targeted
treatment (TAT)) to a focus on high-risk groups and finally passive distribution within health
services coupled with surveillance (e.g. “surveillance and response”[55,56]) and health educa-
tion (e.g. IEC) in the “end game” (Fig 2b).
As for how to control snails, the most common strategy has been to use expensive and toxic
molluscicides; an effort that is neither feasible nor desirable for many poor countries where
schistosomiasis is now endemic. Schistosomiasis has been hard to control without well-funded,
national-level efforts, and the contemporary global health discussion has been focused on strat-
egies that optimize efficiency and affordability. By recognizing the successful use of snail con-
trol for transmission reduction, and by fostering research directed toward the development of
creative, safe and cheap tools to target the snail intermediate host, global schistosomiasis elimi-
nation might be attainable.
