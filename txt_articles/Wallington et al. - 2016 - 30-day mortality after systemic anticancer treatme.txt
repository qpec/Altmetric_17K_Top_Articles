Summary
Background 30-day mortality might be a useful indicator of avoidable harm to patients from systemic anticancer 
treatments, but data for this indicator are limited. The Systemic Anti-Cancer Therapy (SACT) dataset collated by Public 
Health England allows the assessment of factors aff
 ecting 30-day mortality in a national patient population. The aim of 
this fi
 rst study based on the SACT dataset was to establish national 30-day mortality benchmarks for breast and lung 
cancer patients receiving SACT in England, and to start to identify where patient care could be improved.
Methods In this population-based study, we included all women with breast cancer and all men and women with lung 
cancer residing in England, who were 24 years or older and who started a cycle of SACT in 2014 irrespective of the 
number of previous treatment cycles or programmes, and irrespective of their position within the disease trajectory. 
We calculated 30-day mortality after the most recent cycle of SACT for those patients. We did logistic regression 
analyses, adjusting for relevant factors, to examine whether patient, tumour, or treatment-related factors were 
associated with the risk of 30-day mortality. For each cancer type and intent, we calculated 30-day mortality rates and 
patient volume at the hospital trust level, and contrasted these in a funnel plot.
Findings Between Jan 1, and Dec, 31, 2014, we included 23 228 patients with breast cancer and 9634 patients with 
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in our regression and trust-level analyses. 30-day mortality increased with age for 
both patients with breast cancer and patients with NSCLC treated with curative intent, and decreased with age for patients 
receiving palliative SACT (breast curative: odds ratio [OR] 1·085, 99% CI 1·040–1·132; p<0·0001; NSCLC curative: 
1·045, 1·013–1·079; p=0·00033; breast palliative: 0·987, 0·977–0·996; p=0·00034; NSCLC palliative: 0·987, 
0·976–0·998; p=0·0015). 30-day mortality was also signifi
 cantly higher for patients receiving their fi
 rst reported curative 
or palliative SACT versus those who received SACT previously (breast palliative: OR 2·326 99% CI 1·634–3·312; 
p<0·0001; NSCLC curative: 3·371, 1·554–7·316; p<0·0001; NSCLC palliative: 2·667, 2·109–3·373; p<0·0001), and for 
patients with worse general wellbeing (performance status 2–4) versus those who were generally well (breast curative: 
 
6·057, 1·333–27·513; p=0·0021; breast palliative: 6·241, 4·180–9·319; p<0·0001; NSCLC palliative: 3·384, 
2·276–5·032; p<0·0001). We identifi
 ed trusts with mortality rates in excess of the 95% control limits; this included 
seven for curative breast cancer, four for palliative breast cancer, fi
 ve for curative NSCLC, and seven for palliative NSCLC.
Interpretation Our fi
 ndings show that several factors aff
 ect the risk of early mortality of breast and lung cancer 
patients in England and that some groups are at a substantially increased risk of 30-day mortality. The identifi
 cation 
of hospitals with signifi
 cantly higher 30-day mortality rates should promote review of clinical decision making in 
these hospitals. Furthermore, our results highlight the importance of collecting routine data beyond clinical trials to 
better understand the factors placing patients at higher risk of 30-day mortality, and ultimately improve clinical 
decision making. Our insights into the factors aff
 ecting risk of 30-day mortality will help treating clinicians and their 
patients predict the balance of harms and benefi
 ts associated with SACT.

Introduction
The use of systemic anticancer therapies (SACTs) has 
increased substantially in the past three decades.1,2 SACTs 
were previously only used to treat a small number of 
cancer types, but are now used routinely in many patients 
with common solid cancers.1–4 There is huge potential to 
improve patient care if the outcomes of these patients 
can be monitored more eff
 ectively, and if clinicians better 
understand the outcomes that are achieved with current 
approaches to treatment.
SACTs can be given with the aim of improving long-
term survival, either alone or in combination with 
surgery or radiotherapy. They can also be given for 
palliative purposes, to improve the quality of life for 
patients with advanced incurable cancers for as long as 
possible by controlling cancer growth and providing

symptom relief. For some patients, this approach might 
also increase survival time.
Patients dying within 30 days after beginning treatment 
with SACT are unlikely to have gained the survival or 
palliative benefi
 ts of the treatment, and in view of the 
side-eff
 ects sometimes caused by SACT, are more likely to 
have suff
 ered harm. In particular, the risk of neutropenic 
sepsis (infection resulting from low blood neutrophil 
count, probably the most important cause of SACT-related 
death) is highest in the 30 days after SACT, peaking at 
around 11–15 days after treatment.5 SACT cycles are 
typically 21 or, less commonly, 28 days long, so death from 
neutropenic sepsis from the previous treatment is captured 
within the 30-day mortality metric. Simply reducing doses 
of or avoiding SACT altogether would reduce or eliminate 
instances of treatment-related early mortality, but at the 
cost of some patients being denied eff
 ective SACT and 
hence the survival and palliation benefi
 ts.
To maximise the benefi
 ts of SACTs it is therefore 
important to gain a more detailed understanding of how 
the many diff
 erent patient and tumour characteristics 
can predict patient outcomes, such as the risk of early 
mortality. Only a small number of local observational 
studies have assessed 30-day mortality after SACT, but 
each has pointed to areas in which patient care could be 
improved.5–8
Treatment-related early mortality is also commonly 
measured in clinical trials of SACT, but, by necessity, 
patient cohorts are often selected on the basis of protocol-
driven inclusion criteria—eg, within a certain age range, 
good performance status, or limited comorbidities.9,10 
The fi
 ndings from these trials are therefore less reliable 
estimates of treatment-related early mortality in the groups 
not included from the general cancer patient population. 
There is thus a clear need to make use of population-based 
data to establish 30-day mortality benchmarks for the full 
range of patient types, to investigate how patient and 
treatment-related factors aff
 ect the risk of 30-day mortality, 
and to identify diff
 erences between provider trusts to help 
improve clinical outcomes.
Here we examine factors that aff
 ect the risk of 30-day 
mortality in patients with breast and lung cancer in 2014 
using data collected from NHS hospital trusts across 
England in the SACT dataset. The proportion of patients 
dying within 30 days of receiving SACT is potentially 
linked to poor clinical decision making. This outcome 
measure allows us to better understand the factors 
that predict early mortality and identify the patients 
for whom treatment could potentially be improved. 
We additionally characterised the extent of variation in 
30-day mortality rates between hospital trusts in 
England, and identifi
 ed those with signifi
 cantly higher 
30-day mortality rates. This is the fi
 rst time, to our 
knowledge, that 30-day mortality following recently 
reported SACT has been investigated on a large scale in 
a population that refl
 ects the real diversity of patients 
with breast and lung cancer being treated in the National 
Health Service (NHS) in England.
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched PubMed for articles published up to Feb 29, 2016, 
reporting on 30-day mortality after chemotherapy for breast 
and lung cancer. We used the search terms “30-day mortality” 
or “early mortality”; “breast cancer” or “lung cancer”; and 
“systemic anti-cancer therapy” or “chemotherapy”. 
No languages were excluded from our search. We also 
consulted leading clinicians in this specialty for relevant, 
recent published work.
We identifi
 ed four studies investigating the factors associated 
with high 30-day mortality following anticancer treatment in 
patients with a range of cancers including breast and lung, and 
two recent clinical trials that reported on 30-day mortality after 
treatment with current standard treatments for breast and 
lung cancer.
The four studies identifi
 ed were all regional rather than 
national, and the clinical trials were done in selected groups of 
patients (restricted to certain age and performance status 
ranges or with limited comorbidities) so the results do not 
necessarily apply to the national cancer patient population in 
England. We also identifi
 ed previous published work that 
showed variation in 30-day postoperative mortality between 
trusts using funnel plots.
Added value of this study
This study reports on patient, tumour-related, and 
treatment-related factors associated with 30-day mortality 
after systemic anticancer treatment. We studied the diverse 
populations of patients with breast and lung cancer in England 
throughout 2014 using data from the newly available Systemic 
Anti-Cancer Therapy (SACT) dataset. We also presented patient 
volume and 30-day mortality rates at the level of hospital trusts 
as funnel plots. To our knowledge, this is the fi
 rst time this topic 
has been investigated at a national level.
Implications of all the available evidence
This study shows that the SACT dataset provides insight into 
the factors aff
 ecting early mortality of patients in England. 
It suggests that treatment intent (curative or palliative), age, 
performance status, whether patients had received SACT before 
the qualifying treatment used for this study, and sex and stage 
(lung cancer only) all aff
 ect the 30-day mortality risk. 
The discrepancies between patient categories for each of these 
factors point to opportunities for improvements in care. 
The identifi
 cation of hospitals with signifi
 cantly higher 30-day 
mortality rates will promote review of clinical decision making 
in these hospitals. The fi
 ndings presented here could be used to 
improve clinical outcomes.

Methods
Study design and data 
This population-based, observational study11 included all 
breast and lung cancer patients aged 24 years and older 
reported to have received SACT in England between 
Jan 1, and Dec 31, 2014, according to the SACT dataset, 
irrespective of the number of previous treatment cycles 
or programmes, and irrespective of their position within 
the disease trajectory. 
The SACT dataset is a new resource at Public Health 
England, which started a phased implementation in 
2012, and which collects information reported routinely 
by NHS hospital trusts about the treatment of cancer 
in England12 in four key areas: patient and tumour 
characteristics including age, sex, morphology, and 
performance status; hospital and consultant details, 
including General Medical Council (GMC) number; 
treatment characteristics including drug names and 
drug combinations (regimens); and outcome fi
 elds 
including date of most recent treatment and date of 
death (when applicable).
The appendix provides the full data standard, including 
a description of all 43 items recorded, with data fi
 eld 
formats as described in the NHS Data Dictionary13 
(appendix p 1). Several data items are mandatory and 
submissions that omit them are rejected. These are 
primary patient and hospital trust identifi
 ers (NHS 
number, birth date, postcode, SACT provider organisation 
code) and key treatment details (SACT regimen name, 
regimen start date, and cycle number).
Phased introduction of data entry started in April, 2012. 
Monthly data submission has become mandatory for all 
trusts in England from April, 2014. By January, 2014, 
141 (95%) of 148 trusts were routinely submitting at least 
the mandatory data items; because of trust mergers, the 
total number of trusts expected reduced to 147 by 
July 2014. We selected a reporting period of January to 
December, 2014, because this was the most complete 
calendar year of data that was available at the time this 
analysis was completed.14 This reporting period also 
allowed linkage with the English National Cancer 
Registration and Analysis Service (NCRAS), which 
improved data completeness when morphology, stage at 
diagnosis, and dates of death were missing from the 
SACT dataset.
Treatment and patients
We defi
 ned SACT as any cytotoxic chemotherapy, active 
anticancer therapies such as monoclonal antibodies 
(eg, trastuzumab), and targeted biological treatments 
such as EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors. We excluded 
endocrine therapy and supportive therapy treatments 
such as bisphosphonates, denosumab, and anti-emetics. 
We did not distinguish between patients receiving 
combined chemo-radiotherapy and those receiving 
chemotherapy only, as this was poorly recorded in the 
SACT dataset at this stage.
We examined data for breast and lung cancer patients 
(identifi
 ed by the clinical codes in panel 1) because both 
had good data completeness in the SACT dataset; in 
2014, data had been submitted for 18 976 (94%) of 
20 265 patients with breast cancer and 13 405 (92%) of 
14 527 patients with lung cancer who were reported 
to have commenced chemotherapy.13 We provide 
descriptive statistics on small cell lung cancer (SCLC) 
and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) separately, 
based on morphology data (supplemented from cancer 
registry data where missing from the SACT dataset) 
because these cancer types generally require diff
 erent 
treatment strategies. We completed regression analysis 
on NSCLC, but not SCLC, because there were too few 
patients (n=3352) for robust statistical analysis in that 
group. We excluded from our regression analysis all 
patients for whom the start date of their last reported 
cycle of SACT was not reported because this precluded 
an assessment of 30-day mortality.
Outcomes
Of the patients with breast or lung cancer reported to have 
received SACT in England between Jan 1, 2014, and 
Dec 31, 2014, we identifi
 ed those that died within 30 days 
of SACT (from all causes, including iatrogenic deaths or 
those due to disease progression) by calculating the time 
between the start date of the most recently reported SACT 
cycle in 2014 and, when relevant, the date of death for each 
patient. Cycle start date was defi
 ned as the day that the 
patient started receiving SACT treatment in that cycle 
irrespective of cycle length or route of administration. 
From this, we calculated a national 30-day mortality rate by 
dividing the number of patients that received SACT within 
30 days of their death by the total number of patients that 
received SACT in the reporting period. The analysis of

30-day mortality was only done using the most recent cycle 
of SACT if a patient received multiple cycles in the year. 
Patients receiving multiple treatments in the year were 
counted only once in the dataset. We mainly used the date 
of death as reported for a patient through SACT dataset 
returns, but when that was unavailable, we extracted it 
from records in the NCRAS. All patients were traced 
through the NHS Demographics Services using matched 
identifi
 ers (including NHS number, date of birth, and sex).
There were 22 deaths for patients with breast cancer 
and 35 deaths for patients with lung cancer that were 
only recorded in NCRAS, not the SACT dataset or the 
NHS Demographics Service. Of these, only three were 
deaths within 30 days (for patients with lung cancer). 
608 patients with breast cancer and 732 patients with 
NSCLC had confl
 icting dates of death recorded in the 
SACT versus NCRAS datasets; this resulted in a confl
 ict 
about 30-day mortality status (records fl
 agged as death 
within 30 days in one source but not the other) for 
16 patients with breast cancer and 20 with NSCLC.
For 26 patients who died within 30 days of receiving 
SACT, death certifi
 cate data could not be found. The death 
certifi
 cate data may not be timely when inquests or 
coroner investigations are involved. Additionally, patients 
dying overseas might never have their date of death 
recorded in NCRAS, although an embarkation date 
might be recorded. When confl
 icting dates of death were 
recorded in the SACT dataset and NCRAS, we selected 
the date of death reported in the SACT dataset. 
One patient with lung cancer in the 30-day mortality 
group had a diff
 erent date of birth recorded in the cancer 
registry, so we used their date of birth recorded in the 
SACT dataset. For all other patients, NHS number, date 
of birth, and sex were identical in both databases.
Some trusts reported a high proportion of patients as 
having received only the fi
 rst cycle of SACT: 13 trusts 
that treated 574 patients with breast cancer, and 
14 trusts that treated 302 patients with lung cancer, had 
a very high proportion (>80%) of patients for whom 
only the fi
 rst cycle of SACT was reported. Some of 
these patients might have had subsequent cycles 
of chemotherapy that were not recorded in the 
SACT dataset.
Statistical analysis and explanatory variables
We examined the association of age, performance status, 
income deprivation, whether patients had received 
previous SACT (as recorded in the SACT dataset), and 
BMI with 30-day mortality after SACT for breast and 
NSCLC patients. These variables are linked to patient 
care in a clinical setting in relation to SACT treatment; 
income deprivation, while not directly linked to patient 
care, refl
 ects other factors that are—for example, those in 
low-income areas might be more likely to smoke and 
have higher levels of comorbidity.
We also examined the association of sex and cancer 
stage at diagnosis with 30-day mortality for NSCLC 
patients only. We excluded male patients with breast 
cancer from our analysis, so did not study the association 
of sex with 30-day mortality for patients with breast 
cancer. We also did not examine the association of 
cancer stage at diagnosis with 30-day mortality for 
breast cancer because there can be a substantial time 
interval between diagnosis and SACT treatment for 
many breast cancer patients (eg, patients who relapse 
with metastatic disease several years after the initial 
diagnosis), making this indicator less clinically relevant 
than for lung cancer.
Income deprivation was not reported directly by NHS 
hospital trusts in the SACT dataset. Instead, we used 
patient postcodes, as reported in the dataset, to derive 
each patient’s income deprivation score from the English 
Indices of Deprivation 2010,15 and assigned patients into 
fi
 ve groups from least (group 1) to most (group 5) income 
deprived. We chose income deprivation over health-related 
indices, which would have been interrelated with our 
30-day mortality outcome measure.
In the dataset there were missing values for 
performance status and BMI for patients with breast 
cancer or NSCLC, and stage for NSCLC (table 1). 
Inspection of the data showed that for performance 
status, this was mainly the result of a few trusts not 
reporting this measure: four trusts reported no 
performance status data, one of which was a large trust, 
and 12 trusts had 10% or less completion of performance 
status data. Therefore, these data were missing not at 
random (MNAR) at trust level. We assumed data were 
missing completely at random (MCAR) at the patient 
level because we found no evidence to the contrary, and 
these trusts provided care for a range of patients.
Height and weight data (used to calculate BMI) are 
less likely to be recorded for patients receiving 
treatments with a fi
 xed dose; however, many patients 
included in our study received treatments that were 
dosed according to body surface area or weight, some of 
whom also had missing height and weight data, which 
probably obscures this association between BMI and

treatment regimen. Additionally, some trusts with low 
patient volumes (<400 patients) reported no height or 
weight data, giving some evidence for an association 
between BMI and treating trust, although this link is 
probably weak.
Data for stage at diagnosis were more complete: stage 
was reported for 10 408 (93%) of 11 199 patients with lung 
cancer and 13 883 (89%) of 15 626 patients with curative 
breast cancer, compared with 4159 (55%) of 7602 patients 
with palliative breast cancer, suggesting that stage at 
diagnosis data were more likely to be reported when 
patients had a smaller time interval between diagnosis 
and last reported treatment. Most patients with breast 
cancer receiving palliative treatment are likely to be 
stage IV (the most advanced stage); therefore, clinicians 
might be less likely to record stage at diagnosis for these 
patients because it is assumed to be stage IV. Thus, there 
was evidence of an association between stage at diagnosis 
and treatment intent.
Because we assumed that performance status was 
MCAR, and that BMI and stage seemed to be only weakly 
related to treatment regimen and intent, respectively, we 
hypothesised that there would be no variables upon 
which we could base multiple imputation. We tested this 
by attempting multiple imputation16 using the ice 
command in Stata, based on variables of age, sex, intent 
of treatment, patients not having received any previous 
SACT as recorded in the dataset from 2012–14 (treatment 
naive), regimen, income deprivation group, cancer type 
(breast or lung cancer), treating trust, and death within 
30 days.
We used a train-test approach to assess the accuracy 
of this imputed data, whereby from all known data, we 
used the multiple imputation algorithm to estimate 1%, 
5%, 10%, and 20% of the data in multiple tests. 
This approach showed the multiple imputation was 
very error-prone. Based on this fi
 nding, we opted to 
create unknown categories for performance status, 
BMI, and stage. Because the unknown category consists 
of data from the remaining categories, this will add 
noise to the model and reduce statistical power. These 
unknown categories were also used for risk adjustment 
in the funnel plot.
Regression analysis and risk-adjustment
We used logistic regression analysis to assess any 
associations between the explanatory variables and 
30-day mortality. We present the results of these logistic 
regression analyses as adjusted odds ratios (OR) that 
refl
 ect the eff
 ect of each variable in our multivariable 
regression model, alongside the unadjusted OR and 
proportion of patients with 30-day mortality. We used 
Z-tests to examine signifi
 cance and a p value of 0·01 for 
statistical signifi
 cance associated with the OR. We used 
the collin command in Stata to diagnose co-linearity 
between variables in the model. For each model, the 
mean variance infl
 ation factor was lower than 1·04, 
which suggests that there were no issues with co-linearity 
between model terms.
We plotted the errors of the residuals in the model, 
which showed that the variables in our model were 
equally variable and indicated that the assumptions of 
our regression model were valid. To select the model 
that best described our data,17–19 we used the Bayesian 
Information Criterion (BIC) for model comparison. 
In addition to testing the main eff
 ects presented here, 
we tested models with interactions modelled between 
age and performance status, age and BMI, and for 
NSCLC only, sex and performance status, and sex and 
BMI. In each case, the model fi
 t was inferior.
Analyses were completed separately by cancer type 
(breast or NSCLC) further separated by treatment intent 
(curative or palliative) in four regression analyses. 
The treatment intent was specifi
 ed at the time the 
clinicians prescribed SACT. Panel 2 provides typical 
defi
 nitions of treatment intent, but these were not 
specifi
 ed in the SACT dataset. In some cases individual 
clinicians might have used slightly diff
 erent defi
 nitions 
of curative and palliative treatment. In this fi
 rst analysis 
of the SACT dataset, we did not do separate regression 
analyses for each mode of treatment we included as 
curative (panel 2), because this would have resulted in 
smaller group sizes and thus lower statistical power.
We compared 30-day mortality rates between the 
following groups for age, performance status, income 
deprivations, previous SACT treatment, BMI, sex 
(NSCLC), and tumour stage at diagnosis (NSCLC). 
We assessed age as a continuous variable for both 
patients with breast cancer and those with NSCLC. 
For performance status, we recorded patients as PS 0 
(asymptomatic), PS 1 (symptomatic, still able to carry 
out light activities), PS 2–4 (symptomatic patients 
requiring any amount of bed rest during the day, or who 
were completely bed bound, grouped together because 
of small patient numbers), and performance status not 
recorded. For income deprivation, we compared patients

used in this study, as recorded by trusts in electronic 
prescribing systems
Curative modes of treatment
1 Adjuvant: given after surgery to reduce the chance of the 
cancer spreading or coming back
2 Neoadjuvant: given before surgery to shrink a tumour and 
make surgery possible or less disfi
 guring
3 Curative: given alone without other forms of treatment to 
try to cure the cancer completely 
Palliative modes of treatment
1 Palliative: given to maintain or improve the quality of life 
for patients with advanced incurable cancer for as long as 
possible, by controlling the growth of a cancer and 
providing symptom relief

in income domain group 3 (the middle level of 
socioeconomic deprivation based on household income) 
with those in group 1 (least deprived), 2, 4, and 5 (most 
deprived). For previous SACT treatment, we compared 
patients for whom one or more previous systemic 
anticancer treatments were recorded in the SACT 
dataset before the qualifying treatment used in this 
study with patients for whom no previous systemic 
anticancer treatments were recorded in any year 
(2012–14) of the database (treatment naive). For BMI, we 
compared patients with BMI scores in the healthy 
weight range (BMI 18·5 to <25 kg/m²) with those in 
the underweight range (BMI <18·5 kg/m²), overweight 
(BMI 25 to <30 kg/m²), and obese categories 
(BMI >30 kg/m²), and those for whom BMI information 
was not recorded. Specifi
 cally in patients with NSCLC, 
we compared male and female patients and tumour 
stage at diagnosis—patients with stage III NSCLC 
compared with patients with stage I, II, and IV NSCLC, 
and, where relevant, patients for whom stage was not 
recorded.
To generate funnel plots, for every hospital trust, we 
calculated risk-adjusted mortality rates for breast 
curative, breast palliative, NSCLC curative, and NSCLC 
palliative as well as the patient volume treated with 
SACT for each of these patient categories. The factors 
included in the risk adjustment were the same as those 
detailed for the logistic regression analyses (eg, age, 
perfor 
mance status, BMI, and stage at diagnosis).
As noted in the methods for multiple imputation, the 
large number of missing values for performance status 
were a result of a small number of trusts not providing 
any performance status information. We used the 
risk-adjusted mortality rate to create funnel plots using 
the “funnelcompar” command in Stata, which gave the 
95% and 99·8% control limits (dashed lines on the 
graphs) and the national risk-adjusted 30-day mortality 
rate (the horizontal line on each graph).
Role of the funding source
There was no funding source for this study. MWa and 
SM had access to the raw data; all authors had access to 
aggregated data and all analyses. The corresponding 
author had full access to all aggregated data and analyses 
and the fi
 nal responsibility to submit for publication.
Results 
Of the patients in the SACT database, 748 (3%) of 
29 112 patients with breast cancer and 500 (3%) of 
15 545 patients with lung cancer receiving SACT were 
excluded from the analysis due to missing cycle start 
dates. The study population size was thus 43 409 patients 
(28 364 patients with breast cancer and 15 045 patients 
with lung cancer; fi
 gure 1). Treatment intent was not 
recorded for 5136 (18%) of 28 364 patients with breast 
cancer and 2029 (14%) of 15 045 patients with lung 
cancer; these patients were excluded from the regression 
and trust-level analyses. Because of lower patient 
numbers for SCLC (n=3352), we only did the regression 
and trust-level analyses for patients with NSCLC 
(11 199 patients including those for whom treatment 
intent was not recorded). In view of the exclusions, the

fi
 nal cohort for regression and trust-level analyses 
included 23 228 patients with breast cancer and 
9634 patients with NSCLC.
The median patient age was 54 years (IQR 47–64) for 
patients with breast cancer treated with curative intent; 
61 years (51–70) for patients with palliative breast cancer; 
67 years (61–73) for patients with NSCLC  treated with 
curative intent; and 68 years (61–74) for patients with 
NSCLC treated with palliative intent. The appendix 
shows the distribution of age, performance status, 
income deprivation, and BMI by age for patients with 
breast and NSCLC treated with curative and palliative 
intent (appendix pp 2–4).
Data for performance status, a measure of patients’ 
level of cancer symptoms and general wellbeing,20 was 
not reported for 6919 (30%) of 23 228 patients with breast 
cancer and 2968 (31%) of 9634 patients with NSCLC, 
for whom treatment intent was recorded. A further 
2139 (42%) of 5136 patients with breast cancer and 
530 (34%) of 1565 patients with NSCLC, were missing 
both performance status and treatment intent.
Overall, 30-day mortality was higher for patients with 
lung cancer (1274/15 045 [9%]; table 2) than patients 
with breast cancer (700/28 364 [3%]; table 2), and in 
each treatment intent category (curative, palliative, and 
unknown; table 2). 30-day mortality was lowest for 
patients with breast or lung cancer receiving systemic 
anticancer therapy for curative rather than for palliative 
purposes: 41/15 626 (<1%) versus 569/7602 (8%) for 
breast cancer, and 70/2429 (3%) versus 1061/10 587 (10%) 
for lung cancer (table 2). 30-day mortality was higher for 
curative SCLC (14/382 [4%]) than curative NSCLC 
patients, (53/1961 [3%]) and for palliative SCLC 
(308/2582 [12%]) than palliative NSCLC (720/7673 [9%]) 
patients (table 3).
Using the information available on death certifi
 cates, 
provided through the Offi
  ce for National Statistics, 
cancer was confi
 rmed as the underlying cause of death 
for 1279 (92%) of 1384 patients with breast cancer or 
NSCLC dying within 30 days of curative or palliative 
chemotherapy. For the remaining 105 (8%) of patients, 
most death certifi
 cates mentioned cancer.
Table 4 and the appendix (p 4) show all results of the 
regression analysis for patients with breast cancer treated 
with curative intent. 30-day mortality risk signifi
 cantly 
increased with age (OR 1·085, 99% CI 1·040–1·132; 
p<0·0001). 30-day mortality was also higher for patients 
with PS 2–4 compared with those with PS 0, though 
confi
 dence intervals were large (OR 6·057, 99% CI 
1·333–27·513; p=0·0021).

was not recorded also had a higher 30-day mortality 
than those with PS 0 (2·719, 1·888–3·918; p<0·0001). 
Treatment-naive patients receiving palliative treatment 
had a signifi

whom previous SACTs are recorded in the dataset 
between 2012 and 2014 (OR 2·326, 99% CI 1·634–3·312;

signifi
 cantly higher for patients with stage IV (advanced) 
than stage III tumours (OR 1·438, 95% CI 1·099–1·883; 
p=0·00051).
Figures 2–5 show risk-adjusted funnel plots for 
diff
 erent modalities of treatment and cancer type, by 
hospital trust. We identifi
 ed hospital trusts that had 
signifi

seven trusts for breast curative, four for breast palliative, 
fi
 ve for NSCLC curative, and seven for NSCLC 
palliative.
Discussion
In our population-based study of English breast and 
lung cancer patients, 30-day mortality increased with 
age for both patients with breast cancer or NSCLC 
receiving curative SACT, and decreased with age for 
patients receiving palliative SACT. Patients with breast 
cancer or NSCLC with worse general wellbeing 
(indicated by higher PS scores) had higher 30-day 
mortality than those who were generally well (PS 0), and 
30-day mortality was also higher for treatment-naive 
patients than those who had any previously recorded 
cycles of SACT between 2012 and 2014. Our funnel plots 
showed that 30-day mortality varied between trusts, 
with values for some trusts exceeding the 95% control 
limits. Individual trust data will be discussed in a Public 
Health England report.
To our knowledge, this is the fi
 rst time these 
benchmarks in 30-day mortality after SACT have been 
established on a national basis. The 2011 national cancer 
strategy for England proposed 30-day mortality as a 
potential national clinical indicator of avoidable harm 
from SACT21 and it has been used as a clinically relevant 
indicator for SACT in previously published work.5 These 
benchmarks can provide a better understanding of the 
patient characteristics associated with increased 30-day 
mortality and start to support improved clinical 
treatment decision making and identify those hospital 
trusts where clinical practice and data management 
should be reviewed.
A particular strength of 30-day mortality as an outcome 
measure is that it avoids issues with the details and 
coding of causes of death on death certifi
 cates. 
For example, cancer was the cause of death listed for 
30-day mortality

nearly all patients in our study, including those dying 
within 30 days of receiving SACT. Therefore, death 
certifi
 cates would not have provided enough detail to 
assess what factors lead to the patient’s death. However, 
we know that patients who die within 30 days of receiving 
SACT are very unlikely to receive any benefi
 t from it 
irrespective of what their cause of death was. It is 
therefore not necessary to know whether death was 
caused by side-eff
 ects from treatment, cancer pro-
gression, or any other causes to examine factors that 
increase the risk of experiencing net harm rather than 
net benefi
 t from receiving SACT.
The large cohort of breast and lung cancer patients 
included in the SACT dataset gives confi
 dence that the 
associations we recorded between a number of variables 
and higher early mortality in England are real, despite 
some issues with data completeness, which we expect 
to improve in subsequent years of data collection.
The large, signifi
 cant increase in 30-day mortality for 
treatment-naive patients suggests that particular care 
and an emphasis on the early reporting of toxic eff
 ects 
should be undertaken in patients who are SACT 
treatment naive. This approach is consistent with 
fi
 ndings of a previous study of the toxic eff
 ects from lung 
cancer treatment.22 To our knowledge there are no 
previous studies of treatment-naive status in this context, 
so we are unable to identify the reasons behind the 
increased 30-day mortality for these patients.
Our identifi
 cation of treatment-naive patients relied on 
treatment records taken from the SACT dataset alone 
and there are two known data issues reducing the 
accuracy of this grouping. The database was only 
implemented in 2012 and made mandatory in April, 2014, 
so data for previous SACT treatments might be missing 
for some patients (eg, those who received a previous 
treatment before 2012). This issue will be most 
pronounced when there is a long gap between 
penultimate and last reported treatments—eg, for 
recurrent 
tumours. 
Therefore, 
we 
might 
have 
overestimated the number of treatment-naive patients. 
Additionally, the challenge of some trusts only recording 
patients’ fi
 rst cycle of SACT means we might be 
underestimating early mortality from SACT and 
overestimating the increased risk associated with 
treatment-naive patients. As data completeness improves 
in subsequent years, a clearer understanding of the 
association between treatment-naive status and 30-day 
mortality will be possible.

perhaps because older patients are generally more frail 
and less able to tolerate SACT than are younger patients. 
Conversely, 30-day mortality decreased with age for 
patients with breast cancer and NSCLC treated with 
palliative intent, perhaps because older patients are less 
likely likely than younger patients to accept or be 
prescribed SACT treatment that might extend their life 
in favour of other palliative care options to relieve pain or 
discomfort. Alternatively younger patients might have 
more aggressive disease with a higher risk of non-
iatrogenic cancer mortality.23
The fi
 nding that 30-day mortality increased with 
worsening performance status for patients with breast 
cancer or NSCLC treated with palliative intent could be 
because patients with poorer general health are less able 
to tolerate the negative side-eff
 ects of SACT compared 
with healthier individuals, to an extent where the toxic 
eff
 ects outweigh the benefi
 cial eff
 ects.5 These fi
 ndings 
suggest great care is required when advising chemo-
therapy in this patient group.
We noted that 30-day mortality was signifi
 cantly higher 
for patients with breast cancer or NSCLC receiving 
palliative SACT for whom performance status was not 
recorded compared with those with PS 0. Therefore, 
patients with no recorded performance status are likely 
to be mainly a mix of patients with PS 1–4. This result 
might be because PS 0 is relatively easy to defi
 ne, but it 
might be more diffi
  cult for clinicians to score the extent 
of reduced wellbeing.
Our fi
 nding that 30-day mortality was lower in women 
with lung cancer than in men with lung cancer given 
palliative SACT was expected. Previous data suggest that 
women with lung cancer are generally diagnosed at an 
earlier age, with a more localised cancer, and have better 
survival.20 However, to our knowledge there have been no 
specifi
 c investigations of early mortality in this context 
prior to our study, so we are unable at this stage to 
suggest why sex aff
 ects 30-day mortality risk in particular. 
The increased 30-day mortality for NSCLC patients 
receiving palliative SACT who had advanced cancers was 
also expected because these patients are typically less 
well; although again, no previous studies have, to our 
knowledge, investigated the eff
 ect of cancer stage on 
early mortality specifi
 cally.
The fi
 nding that overweight NSCLC patients treated 
with palliative intent had a reduced 30-day mortality 
compared with those in the healthy BMI group could be 
explained by dose-limitation practices. Chemotherapy 
doses are calculated according to patient height and 
weight, but smaller doses than this are often given to 
patients with higher BMI.24,25 These practices might 
reduce short-term mortality in overweight patients. 
However, long-term survival might be lower for these 
patients than those with a healthy BMI if the 
administered dose is not high enough to eff
 ectively 
reduce tumour growth and spread. Research into 
whether there are longer-term survival diff
 erences 
between overweight and healthy weight patients could 
help to elucidate whether there is a problem with 
under-dosing for larger patients. We also noted that 
underweight patients with NSCLC had higher 30-day 
mortality compared with those with normal weight. 
Weight loss is an adverse prognostic factor in lung 
cancer26 and could explain this trend, though the 
diff
 erence recorded was non-signifi
 cant.
The relative risk of overall mortality in obese and 
overweight patients with breast cancer is increased 
compared with healthy weight individuals,27 which

suggests that a high BMI itself does not generally 
confer a signifi
 cant biological protective eff
 ect against 
mortality. If the eff
 ects we recorded are due to 
dose-limitation or patient weight loss, an association 
between BMI and 30-day mortality will probably be 
noted for other cancer types in future reports on the 
SACT dataset.
For patients with NSCLC treated palliatively with no 
recorded BMI, 30-day mortality was signifi
 cantly lower 
than for those with a healthy BMI, but this reduction in 
risk was smaller than for overweight and obese patients, 
suggesting the BMI unknown group is probably mainly 
a mix of healthy weight and overweight patients. As data 
completeness improves, we will better understand the 
distribution of BMI scores amongst patients receiving 
SACT, and obtain improved estimates of 30-day 
mortality for each BMI group.
Although we identifi
 ed several factors aff
 ecting 30-day 
mortality risk, our population-based dataset included 
only patients that received SACT, so we cannot confi
 rm 
whether patients would have had better outcomes if they 
had not received SACT. Similarly we cannot assess 
whether patients who did not receive SACT might have 
benefi
 ted from treatment. Through more sophisticated 
links with audit data and other data sources in future, we 
intend to investigate treatment rates alongside mortality 
by trust, which would provide some information about 
outcomes for these patient groups. However, overall, the 
above fi
 ndings suggest that eff
 orts need to be made to 
further study the factors aff
 ecting 30-day mortality in 
England with the objective of developing a clinical 
decision support tool.
Our data also suggest that 30-day mortality might be 
higher than previously estimated by several clinical 
trials.9,10 The 30-day mortality rate after SACT with 
curative intent for NSCLC reported here is high at 3% 
compared with published trial data for the standard 
treatments, which suggested that 0·8% of patients died 
from treatment-induced toxicity when chemotherapy 
was given as adjuvant treatment alongside surgery.9 
These patients have been assessed as fi
 t enough for 
radical curative treatment (eg, thoracic surgery with 
adjuvant systemic anticancer therapy), estimated to 
increase the average NSCLC 5-year survival by 
4–5%, as reviewed by Heon and Johnson.28 Therefore, 
the high mortality rate we report here is a concern 
because it could reduce any benefi
 t from this 
intervention.
The 30-day mortality rate in breast cancer patients 
receiving curative SACT under the age of 60 in our 
dataset was similar to the treatment-related mortality 
estimated in the UK TACT trial,10 which included 
patients in a similar age range. However, 30-day 
mortality increased with age for patients with breast 
cancer, and those aged 60–69 years, and 70 years and 
older had higher mortality than those in the UK TACT 
trial. This cohort represents a large proportion of 
patients with breast cancer with higher mortality than is 
typically reported in clinical trials: 26% of patients with 
breast cancer diagnosed in England in 2013 were older 
than 60 years, with incidence peaking between the ages 
of 65 and 69 years.29 This might be because clinical trials 
typically recruit a fi
 tter cohort of patients with a lower 
disease burden and better performance status than 
the overall patient population receiving treatment to 
clearly determine the eff
 ects of the interventions under 
investigation, and to ensure older and less well patients 
are not put at risk. Patients in trials also tend to receive 
more intensive support and follow up.
Therefore, our analysis highlights the value of 
investigating SACT treatment outcomes on a national 
scale, and shows that fi
 ndings of clinical trials in selected 
age cohorts cannot readily be generalised to all patients. 
Our fi
 nding that 30-day mortality is higher in patients 
with lung cancer than in those with breast cancer 
matches clinical expectations. Lung cancer often 
occurs in patients with signifi
 cant smoking-related 
comorbidities, which are likely to increase the risk of 
30-day mortality,6 although the lack of available 
comorbidity data meant that we could not account 
for them in these analyses. Patient cohort size was 
insuffi
  cient at this stage for analysis of 30-day mortality 
in patients with SCLC, amongst whom early mortality 
was high. Future analyses will pool data for multiple 
years (as it becomes available) to provide suffi
  ciently 
large patient cohorts to examine the impact of patient 
and 
disease 
characteristics 
on 
30-day 
mortality 
from SCLC.
We predicted higher 30-day mortality for patients 
receiving palliative SACT because these patients are not 
expected to recover from their cancer and the burden of

disease is generally high. However, it remains important 
to weigh up the important benefi
 ts some patients receive 
from palliative treatment with emerging evidence 
suggesting that patients prescribed chemotherapy at the 
end of life overall experience a net reduction in their 
quality of life.30,31 Patient choice is an important factor in 
these decisions; previous fi
 ndings showed that patients 
with cancer were much more likely to accept intensive 
SACT treatment with only a small chance of benefi
 t 
compared with doctors and nurses.32 To help clinicians 
and patients to make treatment decisions that are 
most likely to produce the desired outcomes, we must 
understand the factors aff
 ecting the balance between 
benefi
 ts and harms of palliative SACT, which we have 
started to investigate here. These factors should be a 
focus of discussions about treatment between patients 
and their clinicians to allow better informed decisions 
and improved outcomes.
In future studies based on the SACT dataset, we hope 
to examine diff
 erences in the factors aff
 ecting 30-day 
mortality between subcategories of patients that received 
curative SACT (adjuvant, neoadjuvant, and curative), 
which we were unable to do in this initial analysis due 
to insuffi
  cient patient numbers in each sub-category. 
This analysis will be possible once data on more patients 
become available in subsequent years.
We also identifi
 ed several trusts with signifi
 cantly 
higher levels of 30-day mortality. We have written to all 
trusts to inform them of their 30-day mortality rates, and 
have specifi
 cally encouraged outlier trusts to review both 
their clinical practice and also their data management 
systems. At present, it is possible that hospital trusts are 
identifi
 ed as outliers owing to poor data management 
practices rather than the delivery of poor clinical care. 
Analogously, simply because a hospital trust fell within 
the control limits of the funnel plots, it does not 
guarantee that each patient received optimal treatment, 
as data issues may be obscuring instances of suboptimal 
clinical decision making. It is also possible that hospitals 
with signifi
 cantly lower 30-day mortality rates are not 
tolerating any risk and are treating only the fi
 ttest 
patients, which may have the unintended consequence 
of not treating patients who could have potentially 
benefi
 ted from receiving SACT. More comprehensive 
case mix adjustment and better data completeness will, 
in time, allow national datasets such as the SACT dataset 
to be used as a performance management tool.
Although we have made some important insights 
into 30-day mortality using the SACT dataset, some 
limitations and gaps in reporting still remain. The SACT 
dataset uses only routinely reported data with no clinical 
note or pro-forma review. Therefore, the dataset does 
not include items such as laboratory indicator test 
results—eg, for liver and renal function, so we are 
unable to analyse any association between these 
indicators and 30-day mortality, or use them in risk 
adjustment models.
At this stage, we did not assess whether drug dosage 
was appropriate, and whether this was associated with 
30-day mortality because this was beyond the scope of our 
fi
 rst report. However, analyses of these data in future 
reports would be valuable, for example in assessing 
whether SACT regimens are both clinically eff
 ective and 
cost-eff
 ective. For some patients, only the fi
 rst cycle of 
SACT was recorded. Subsequently, some of those patients 
probably received subsequent cycles that were not 
recorded in the dataset, whose absence from the SACT 
dataset would artifi
 cially increase the time between cycle 
start date and date of death, and lower 30-day mortality. 
This omission might also artifi
 cially increase the risk of 
30-day mortality associated with being treatment naive, 
because later cycles of SACT, and therefore any deaths 
within 30 days of those later cycles, were not recorded. 
As shown in table 1, data for performance status, BMI, 
and cancer stage was also missing for some patients. 
Issues with missing data will be resolved through 
improvements in SACT data reporting by trusts through 
e-prescribing systems in subsequent years.
Compared with the National Cancer Waiting Times 
database, the SACT dataset captured 94% and 92% of 
patients with breast and lung cancer, respectively, 
reported to have received SACT in 2014.13 3% of both 
patients with breast cancer and with lung cancer 
receiving SACT were also excluded from the analyses in 
this report due to missing cycle start dates. Some of 
these missing data could be due to delayed or phased 
reporting because the dataset was only mandated from 
April, 2014 (the proportion of trusts reporting on at least 
the mandatory data fi
 elds was 141 [95%] of 148 in 
January, 2014, but 147 [100%] of 147 by July).
Some NHS trusts reported incorrect names for the 
combinations of SACTs (regimens) given to some 
confi
 rmed breast and lung cancer patients included in our 
analyses, which highlights the need for trusts to improve 
the quality of their regimen data reporting. For some 
trusts, some patients reported to have died were recorded 
as having been prescribed SACT that had not actually 
been given. This error could be because SACT is recorded 
some time before its administration, and the record might 
not be updated if treatment is delayed or omitted, which is 
likely to falsely increase 30-day mortality.
We acknowledge that performance status might not 
have accurately refl
 ected comorbidity status, which 
can be associated with socioeconomic deprivation 
(eg, through a higher prevalence of smoking amongst 
more socioeconomically deprived patients), which might 
aff
 ect whether these patients receive SACT. Therefore, 
improved data collection on comorbidity status would 
enable us to investigate the association between 
socioeconomic deprivation and 30-day mortality more 
thoroughly in future.

 rst time to our knowledge, our analysis of the

information) gives us important insights into 30-day 
mortality in a large, representative population of patients 
with breast or lung cancer receiving systemic anticancer 
therapy in England. Our data suggest that treatment 
intent, patient age, performance status, whether patients 
had received previous systemic anticancer treatments, 
and sex all aff
 ect 30-day mortality risk in this context. 
There is variation between hospital trusts in the rates of 
30-day mortality, with some trusts having signifi
 cantly 
higher rates for early mortality. The reasons for this 
variation require further investigation. Some patients 
may not have benefi
 ted from decisions to give SACT; 
accurate and complete reporting of SACT data on a 
national scale is therefore crucial to provide real world 
information to support clinicians with decision making 
on treatment, complementing evidence from clinical 
trial data.
