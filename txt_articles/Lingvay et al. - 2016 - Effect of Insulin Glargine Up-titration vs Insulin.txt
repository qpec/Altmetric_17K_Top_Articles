IMPORTANCE Achieving glycemic control remains a challenge for patients with type 2
diabetes, even with insulin therapy.
OBJECTIVE To assess whether a fixed ratio of insulin degludec/liraglutide was noninferior to
continued titration of insulin glargine in patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes treated
with insulin glargine and metformin.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Phase 3, multinational, multicenter, 26-week,
randomized, open-label, 2-group, treat-to-target trial conducted at 75 centers in 10 countries
from September 2013 to November 2014 among 557 patients with uncontrolled diabetes
treated with glargine (20-50 U) and metformin (�1500 mg/d) with glycated hemoglobin
(HbA1c) levels of 7% to 10% and a body mass index of 40 or lower.
INTERVENTIONS 1:1 randomization to degludec/liraglutide (n = 278; maximum dose, 50 U of
degludec/1.8 mg of liraglutide) or glargine (n = 279; no maximum dose), with twice-weekly
titration to a glucose target of 72 to 90 mg/dL.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Primary outcome measure was change in HbA1c level after
26 weeks, with a noninferiority margin of 0.3% (upper bound of 95% CI, <0.3%). If
noninferiority of degludec/liraglutide was achieved, secondary end points were tested for
statistical superiority and included change in HbA1c level, change in body weight, and rate of
confirmed hypoglycemic episodes.

CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes taking
glargine and metformin, treatment with degludec/liraglutide compared with up-titration of
glargine resulted in noninferior HbA1c levels, with secondary analyses indicating greater HbA1c
level reduction after 26 weeks of treatment. Further studies are needed to assess longer-term
efficacy and safety.

A
chieving optimal glucose control is a challenge for the
majority of patients with type 2 diabetes, with less than
one-third of patients treated with basal insulin reach-
ing a glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level of less than 7.0%.1 De-
spite this, many patients continue basal insulin without treat-
ment intensification.2 Traditionally, such patients and their
clinicians intensify the insulin regimen, generally by further
up-titrationofthebasalin-
sulin dose or with the ad-
dition of 1 or more meal-
time insulin injections.
Both options increase the
risk of hypoglycemia and
weight gain. In addition,
there may be a practical
limit to the glucose-lowering efficacy achievable with insulin
titration alone, irrespective of the regimen. Recently, combi-
nationsofglucagon-likepeptide-1receptoragonists(GLP-1RAs)
and basal insulin have been recommended as an alternative
in international guidelines, extending the intensification op-
tions available.3
In this trial, we addressed the practical and patient-
centered question of the relative efficacy and safety of opti-
mized and unlimited titration of a once-daily injection of basal
insulin (glargine) vs a once-daily injection of the fixed-ratio
combination of basal insulin degludec (dose limit of 50 U) and
the GLP-1RA liraglutide (dose limit of 1.8 mg) (hereafter re-
ferredtoasdegludec/liraglutide).Althoughcomparisonsofde-
gludec/liraglutide to more complex insulin regimens are being
studied in an ongoing trial,4 the use of basal insulin in combi-
nation with oral agents is the dominant treatment strategy for
refractory hyperglycemia and the most relevant comparator
for clinicians.
Theprimaryobjectiveofthistrialwastodeterminewhether
degludec/liraglutide was noninferior to up-titration of glargine

trolled type 2 diabetes treated with glargine and metformin. If

adhere to the protocol. The trial protocol and statistical analy-
sis plan are available in Supplement 1.
Interventions
Patients were randomized 1:1 via an interactive voice/web re-
sponse system to receive degludec/liraglutide or continued
glargine,eachtreatmenttitratedtothesamefastingglucosetar-
get. Patients randomized to degludec/liraglutide discontinued
glargineandinitiateddegludec/liraglutideat16dosesteps(16U
of degludec/0.6 mg of liraglutide), irrespective of the dose of
glargine at the time of randomization, and dosed once daily at
anytimeofday,preferablyatthesametimeeveryday.Themaxi-
mum allowed dose was 50 dose steps providing 50 U of de-
gludec and 1.8 mg of liraglutide (the maximum dose of liraglu-
tide approved for the type 2 diabetes indication).
Patients randomized to glargine continued treatment with
their pretrial dosing, with no maximum daily dose during the
trial period. Glargine was dosed once daily according to the lo-
cally approved prescribing information.
Inbothgroups,target-driventitrationwasperformedtwice
weekly based on the mean of 3 previous daily self-monitored
prebreakfast blood glucose measurements. If this mean was
above or below the 72 to 90 mg/dL target (to convert glucose
to mmol/L, multiply by 0.0555), patients were to respec-
tively increase or decrease their dose by 2 dose steps or 2 U.
Main Outcomes and Measures
The primary end point was change in HbA1c level from base-
lineto26weeks.Secondaryendpointswerechangefrombase-
line in body weight and number of treatment-emergent hy-
poglycemicepisodesduring26weeks.Exploratoryprespecified
end points included insulin dose, change from baseline in fast-
ing plasma glucose (FPG) level, 9-point self-measured blood
glucose (SMBG) profile, responders for HbA1c level (pre-
defined targets of <7.0% and ≤6.5%), and for composite tar-
gets based on HbA1c level without hypoglycemia and/or with-
out weight gain. Time points included in the 9-point SMBG
profile were breakfast, 90 minutes after breakfast, lunch, 90
minutes after lunch, dinner, 90 minutes after dinner, bed-
time, 4:00 AM, and breakfast the next day. Post-hoc analysis
of mean blood glucose at each time point in the 9-point SMBG
profileandanalysisofconfirmedhypoglycemiabyendoftreat-
ment HbA1c level were also performed. Safety end points in-
cludednumberoftreatment-emergentadverseeventsandnoc-
turnal hypoglycemic episodes during the 26-week treatment
period, change from baseline in standard laboratory analyses
(including lipid profile, amylase, lipase, and calcitonin), blood
pressure, electrocardiogram, and pulse.
Confirmed hypoglycemic episodes were defined as epi-
sodes in which plasma glucose was biochemically confirmed
as less than 56 mg/dL, with or without symptoms or in which
the patient required assistance. A hypoglycemic episode was
classified as severe if the patient required assistance, and noc-
turnal if it occurred between 12:01 AM and 05:59 AM (both in-
clusive). Patient-reported outcomes were measured using the
Treatment-Related Impact Measure for Diabetes (TRIM-D) and
36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36).

Ethnicity and race were recorded to meet regulatory re-
quirements and were self-reported by the participant from a
predefined list.
All collected blood samples were processed and shipped
immediately to a central laboratory (Quintiles), where all para-
meters were analyzed.
Statistical Analysis
The trial was powered to the primary objective of demonstrat-
ing noninferiority using a t test under the following assump-
tions:notreatmentdifference,anoninferioritymarginof0.3%,
1:1 randomization, nominal power of 90%, standard devia-
tionof1%,and15%dropout.Thenoninferioritymarginof0.3%
was selected based on existing US Food and Drug Administra-
tion (FDA) guidance, and is considered in the field the mini-
mal clinically significant change for HbA1c level.5
In total, 554 patients were planned to be randomized. The
primary end point was analyzed using a standard analysis of
covariance (ANCOVA) model, including treatment and region
as fixed factors and baseline HbA1c level as covariate. For sec-
ondary end points the family-wise type I error was controlled
using 1-sided testing at the 2.5% level using the following pre-
specifiedtestprocedurethatcombineshierarchicaltestingand
the Holm-Bonferroni method. First, the primary end point was
tested for noninferiority using 1-sided testing at the 2.5% level.
Second, if statistical significance was obtained, testing pro-
ceeded (hierarchical part) to the secondary end points. In turn,
these end points were tested by the Holm-Bonferroni method
comparing 1-sided P values against 2.5% significance levels ad-
justed for multiplicity.6 Exploratory end points were tested
2-sided at the 5% level and not adjusted for multiplicity.
Continuous end points were analyzed by ANCOVA with
treatment and region as fixed factors and corresponding base-
line value as covariate (plus baseline HbA1c level for dose); fast-
ing lipid laboratory analyses were log-transformed prior to the
analysis.The9-pointSMBGprofilevalueswereanalyzedjointly
using a linear mixed-model with an unstructured residual co-
variance matrix for measurements within patient and with
treatment, time point, region, and interaction between treat-
mentandtimepointasfixedeffectsandbaseline9-pointSMBG
profile values as covariates. Hypoglycemic episodes were ana-
lyzed using a negative binomial regression model with a log-
link function and log of the exposure time as offset that in-
cluded treatment and region as fixed factors. Responder end
points (proportion of patients achieving HbA1c level <7.0%,
HbA1clevel≤6.5%,andthecompositeendpointsdescribedpre-
viously) were analyzed by a generalized linear model with bi-
nomial distribution and identity link that included treatment
as a fixed factor. The choice of ANCOVA for continuous end
points was based on European Medicines Agency (EMA)/FDA
guidance and wide acceptance, and the negative binomial
analysis of hypoglycemic events is widely accepted for diabe-
tes trials.5,7,8 Models were checked by residual plots and di-
agnostic statistics. Statistical analyses were based on the full

In this particular trial, the 2 analysis sets are identical (ie, all

The estimated treatment differences (ETD) were calculated
from the point estimates of the 2 treatments from the ANCOVA
model (treatment factor levels) and associated standard error
and covariance.
Sensitivity analyses were performed for secondary end
points. For continuous end points (HbA1c level and weight) re-
peated measures and 2 multiple imputation–based methods
with sequential ANCOVAs were conducted.9,10 Hypoglyce-
mic episodes were analyzed by multiple imputation method
using a posterior Bayesian approach.11
All statistical analyses were performed using SAS
(SAS Institute), version 9.3.
Results
Patient Population
Patients from 10 countries were included, 767 were screened,
and 557 were randomized and exposed to the trial products
(Figure1)fromSeptember20,2013,throughNovember4,2014.
Of the 557 patients randomized (mean: age 58.8 years; women,
49.7%), 92.5% completed the trial and provided data at 26
weeks.Thetreatmentgroupswerecomparableatbaselinewith
respect to demographics and characteristics (Table 1). In total,
239 of 278 patients receiving degludec/liraglutide (86%) and
255 of 279 patients receiving glargine (91%) attended all sched-
uled visits from week 0 to 26.
Primary Objective
HbA1c level decreased from baseline for the degludec/
liraglutide group (8.4% [SD, 0.9%]) and glargine group (8.2%
[SD, 0.9%]) over the first 16 weeks of treatment and stabilized
at 6.6% for the degludec/liraglutide group (SD, 0.9%) and 7.1%
for the glargine group (SD, 0.9%) by week 26. After 26 weeks
of treatment, mean HbA1c level had decreased by 1.81% for the
degludec/liraglutide group (SD, 1.08%) and by 1.13% for the
glargine group (SD, 0.98%) with glargine corresponding to an
ETD of –0.59% (95% CI, –0.74% to –0.45%) (Table 2 and
Figure 2A), demonstrating noninferiority of degludec/
liraglutide (upper bound of the 95% CI, –0.45%; less than the
noninferiority margin of 0.3%, 1-sided P for noninferior-
ity < .001) compared with glargine.
Secondary End Points
The ETD for change in HbA1c level (–0.59% [95% CI, –0.74%
to –0.45%], 1-sided P < .001) also met criteria for statistical
superiority of degludec/liraglutide vs glargine (Table 2 and

Figure 2A). A reduction in body weight of 1.4 kg (SD, 3.5) was
observed in the degludec/liraglutide group from 88.3 kg (SD,
17.5) to 86.9 kg (SD, 17.2), whereas the glargine group had an
increase in body weight of 1.8 kg (SD, 3.6) from 87.3 kg (SD,
15.8) to 89.1 kg (SD, 15.9); ETD, –3.20 kg (95% CI, –3.77 to
–2.64), 1-sided P < .001 (Table 2 and Figure 2B). Confirmed
hypoglycemia occurred in fewer patients receiving degludec/
liraglutide than those receiving glargine (28.4% for the
degludec/liraglutide group and 49.1% for the glargine group),
with reduced rates of 2.23 episodes vs 5.05 episodes per
patient-year of exposure (PYE) (estimated rate ratio, 0.43
[95% CI, 0.30 to 0.61], 1-sided P < .001) (Table 2; Figure 2C).
One severe hypoglycemic episode was reported in the trial,
which was in the glargine group. Sensitivity analyses all dem-
onstrated similar results in terms of statistical significance
and effect sizes (eTable 1 in Supplement 2).
Exploratory Prespecified End Points
FPG level had decreased in both groups after 26 weeks of treat-
ment to 109.5 mg/dL (SD, 38.4) for the degludec/liraglutide
group and 110.2 mg/dL (SD, 38.6) for the glargine group; ETD,
–0.15 mg/dL (95% CI, –6.28 to 5.99), P = .96 (Figure 3A). Mean
SMBG levels measured for dose adjustment decreased in both
groups over the first 12 weeks (more rapidly with degludec/
liraglutide) and stabilized until week 26 at 105.8 mg/dL (SD,
26.0) for the degludec/liraglutide group and at 100.7 mg/dL
(SD, 23.7) for the glargine group, as expected in a treat-to-
target trial.
At week 26, the mean of the 9-point SMBG measure-
ments had decreased in both groups, by 45.6 mg/dL (SD, 44.9)
from baseline to 136.5 mg/dL (SD, 34.6) at 26 weeks for de-
gludec/liraglutide and by 42.6 mg/dL (SD, 49.5) from base-
line to 141.4 mg/dL (SD, 33.8) at 26 weeks for glargine. The be-
tween-group ETD was –4.0 mg/dL (95% CI, –9.6 to 1.6), P = .16
(Figure 3B).
Morepatientsrandomizedtodegludec/liraglutideachieved
HbA1c targets (specifically, <7.0% as well as ≤6.5%) than with
glargine, and did so without weight gain and/or hypoglyce-
mia (P < .001 for all) (Table 3).
In the glargine group, 24.4% of patients reported noctur-
nal confirmed hypoglycemic episodes, as did 6.1% in the

the glargine group and 0.22 for the degludec/liraglutide group.
The estimated rate ratio for nocturnal hypoglycemia was 0.17
(95% CI, 0.10 to 0.31), P < .001 (Figure 3C).
After 26 weeks, there were increases in the mean daily

1.48 mg of liraglutide) (range, 16–50) and to 66 U for glargine

Patient-Reported Outcomes
The physical component score of the SF-36 questionnaire
improved with degludec/liraglutide (from 47.4 [95% CI, 46.4
to 48.5] at baseline to 49.0 [95% CI, 48.0 to 50.0] at week 26)
and worsened with glargine (from 47.7 [95% CI, 46.7 to 48.7]
at baseline to 47.2 [95% CI, 46.1 to 48.3] at week 26); ETD, 1.9
[95% CI, 0.8 to 3.1], P < .001 (eTable 2 in Supplement 2). This
was also the case with physical functioning (ETD, 1.4 [95%
CI, 0.0 to 2.7], P = .045) and bodily pain (ETD, 2.0 [95% CI,
0.4 to 3.6], P = .01) subdomains; the general health subdo-
main score increased more with degludec/liraglutide (from
42.9 [95% CI, 41.9 to 44.0] at baseline to 46.2 [95% CI, 45.2 to
47.3] at week 26) than with glargine (from 43.6 [95% CI, 42.5
to 44.7] at baseline to 45.0 [95% CI, 43.9 to 46.1] at week 26;
ETD, 1.7 [95% CI, 0.4 to 2.9], P = .008). There was no between-
group difference in overall mental score (ETD, –0.1 [95% CI,
–1.5 to 1.3], P = .93) or any component subdomains. Patient-
reported outcome scores using the TRIM-D questionnaire im-
proved in all subdomains and in total score in both groups. The
increase in total score was greater with degludec/liraglutide
(from 74.6 [95% CI, 73.1 to 76.2] at baseline to 82.1 [95% CI,
80.6 to 83.7] at week 26) compared with glargine (from 73.6
[95% CI, 72.1 to 75.1] at baseline to 78.9 [95% CI, 77.4 to 80.4]
at week 26; ETD, 2.8 [95% CI, 0.9 to 4.7], P = .003), largely
driven by higher scores than glargine in the treatment burden
(ETD, 3.7 [95% CI, 0.7 to 6.8], P = .02) and diabetes manage-
ment (ETD, 7.2 [95% CI, 4.2 to 10.2], P < .001) subdomains,
indicating higher treatment satisfaction with degludec/
liraglutide (eTable 2 in Supplement 2).

Post Hoc Analyses
The lower rate of confirmed hypoglycemia observed with
degludec/liraglutide compared with glargine was also seen
irrespective of end-of-trial HbA1c level (eFigure 1 in Supplement
2). Post hoc analysis of the 9-point SMBG measurements,
using a linear mixed-model, showed a statistically signifi-
cantly lower blood glucose level 90 minutes after lunch
(ETD, –11.54 mg/dL [95% CI, –19.83 to –3.25], P = .006),
before dinner (ETD, –12.48 mg/dL [95% CI, –20.05 to –4.92],
P = .001), and after dinner (ETD, –10.24 mg/dL [95% CI,
–19.45 to –1.02], P = .03), but a higher blood glucose level
before breakfast (ETD, 8.28 mg/dL [95% CI, 2.98 to 13.59],
P = .002) and before breakfast on the following day (ETD,
7.23 mg/dL [95% CI, 1.42 to 13.04], P = .02) for degludec/
liraglutide than with glargine; blood glucose levels were
similar at the other 4 time points.

Vital Parameters
After 26 weeks of treatment, heart rate increased in the de-
gludec/liraglutide group and remained similar to baseline with
glargine (ETD, 3.71 beats/min [95% CI, 2.33 to 5.08], P < .001).
Systolic blood pressure decreased with degludec/liraglutide
and remained unchanged with glargine (ETD, –3.57 mm Hg
[95% CI, –5.54 to –1.59], P < .001). There was no difference in
the change in diastolic blood pressure between the groups
(ETD, 0.91 mm Hg [95% CI, –0.28 to 2.10], P = .14), which re-
mained similar to baseline (eTable 3 in Supplement 2).
Laboratory Measurements
After 26 weeks of treatment, total cholesterol (estimated
treatment ratio [ETR], 0.95 [95% CI, 0.92 to 0.98], P <.001),
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (ETR, 0.92 [95% CI,
0.88 to 0.97], P <.001) and free fatty acids (ETR, 0.85 [95%
CI, 0.80 to 0.92], P <.001) were lower with degludec/
liraglutide than with glargine. No differences were
observed for high-density lipoprotein, very low–density
lipoprotein, and triglycerides between the groups at the end
of trial.

There were increases in mean lipase (17.6 U/L [SD, 37.0];

[SD,22.1];toconverttoμkat/L,multiplyby0.0167)activitydur-

minimal change in the glargine group (–2.2 U/L [SD, 29.2] for
lipase and 2.2 U/L [SD, 18.4] for amylase).
Calcitonin levels were similar between the degludec/
liraglutide and glargine groups throughout the trial and there
was no clinically relevant change from baseline at week 26 in
either group: median change from baseline 0.0 pg/mL (range,
–3.4-47.7) for the degludec/liraglutide group and 0.0 pg/mL
(range, –20.5-8.0) for the glargine group (to convert to pmol/L,

Adverse Events
The overall rate of adverse events per 100 PYE was 343.3 for
thedegludec/liraglutidegroupand286.4fortheglarginegroup.
Serious adverse events per 100 PYE were 3.9 for the degludec/
liraglutide group and 6.7 for the glargine group. The majority
of adverse events were mild and judged to be unlikely related
to the trial products by the investigator. A higher proportion
of adverse events were judged related to the trial product in
the degludec/liraglutide group, these were mainly gastroin-
testinal disorders. Accordingly, nausea was reported by more
patients in the degludec/liraglutide group (9.4%; n = 26; 26.2
events per 100 PYE) than the glargine group (1.1%; n = 3; 2.2
events per 100 PYE). However, no more than 4% of patients
experienced nausea with degludec/liraglutide at any given
week during the trial (eFigure 2 in Supplement 2).

Discussion
Among patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes treated with
glargine and metformin, degludec/liraglutide achieved nonin-
ferior HbA1c level reduction (primary objective), and subse-
quently statistically greater HbA1c level reduction (secondary
objective) compared with continued glargine titration, when
both products were titrated to the same fasting glycemic tar-
get. Further analyses demonstrated that degludec/liraglutide
wasassociatedwithweightlosscomparedwithweightgainwith
glargine and a lower rate of hypoglycemia.
Despite the initial reduction in insulin dose for patients
randomized to the degludec/liraglutide group, from a mean
of 31 U to 16 dose steps (including a liraglutide component of
0.6 mg), there was no deterioration in mean SMBG measure-
ment immediately following this switch. The mean SMBG
measurement decrease following randomization was greater
in the degludec/liraglutide group, indicating a faster thera-
peutic response to degludec/liraglutide initiation compared
with glargine up-titration. The maximum allowed dose of
degludec/liraglutide was 50 dose steps, whereas there was no
predefined maximum daily dose of glargine. Despite the dos-
ing cap, a statistically and clinically significantly greater HbA1c
level reduction was achieved in the degludec/liraglutide group
compared with the glargine group (final dose 41 U in the
degludec/liraglutide group vs 66 U in the glargine group). The
majority of patients treated with degludec/liraglutide met the
less than 7.0% and 6.5% or less HbA1c level targets, more than
those in the glargine group, with a lower rate of hypoglyce-
mia. These findings highlight the therapeutic benefits of the
liraglutide component and its insulin-sparing effect.
The combination of basal insulin and GLP-1RA as a treat-
ment option is well established.3,12 Concern about hypogly-
cemia is a barrier to good glycemic control, rendering pa-
tients unwilling to optimize treatment with insulin13 and
clinicians reticent to recommend more aggressive treatment
targets.14 The burden of treatment complexity13,14 and con-

cerns about weight gain15 may contribute to poor patient ad-
herence to treatment intensification.16 Equally, physicians cite
lack of experience and time to educate patients as a barrier to
initiating, modifying, and intensifying insulin treatment.17 As
a once daily, single injection that is effective, associated with
weight loss, and a low risk of hypoglycemia, degludec/
liraglutide may overcome many of the barriers to treatment in-
tensification in patients treated with basal insulin. This sug-
gestion is supported by the patient-reported outcome results.
Gastrointestinal complications are well-known adverse ef-
fects of treatment with GLP-1RA.18 In the liraglutide clinical
development program, nausea was reported by between 14%
and 40% of patients treated with 1.2 mg and 1.8 mg of liraglu-
tide compared with glargine and placebo.19,20 In this trial, a
lower proportion of patients treated with degludec/
liraglutide reported 1 or more episodes of nausea (9.4%). This
is likely due to a more gradual titration regimen for degludec/
liraglutide compared with that customarily used for liraglu-
tide (0.6 mg weekly). The liraglutide component in degludec/
liraglutide is up-titrated in smaller increments (up to 0.072 mg
twice weekly) with the titration scheme used, contributing to
the tolerability of the product. The open-label nature of this
trial could have introduced an unconscious bias resulting in
overreporting of these events, as even fewer patients re-
ported nausea (6.5%) in a double-blinded trial comparing
degludec/liraglutide with insulin degludec.21
This study had several important limitations. It was nec-
essary to perform the trial with an open-label design as the
maximum dose of degludec/liraglutide was 50 dose steps and
otherwise a double-dummy design would have been re-
quired with patients administering 2 injections daily in unla-
beled syringes. The open-label nature of the trial may have
biased reporting of adverse events by investigators or patient-
reported outcomes scoring by patients. However, the event ad-
judication committee, who adjudicated cardiovascular, neo-
plasm, thyroid disease, or pancreatitis events were blinded to
randomized treatment. The clinical applicability of this trial
is limited to those who fit the inclusion and exclusion crite-
ria. In clinical practice, this means that care must be taken to
avoid extrapolating expectations from these results to pa-
tients with diabetes who were, for example, previously un-
controlled on a higher dose of basal insulin (ie, >50 U) or basal
insulin in combination with therapies other than metformin.
Though the fasting glucose level achieved by study end is simi-
larbetweengroupsandtoothertreattotargettrialsandthough
the differences of rates of hypoglycemia were substantial, the
mean glargine dose did not reach a plateau at study end; this
does raise the possibility that with longer treatment duration
or alternative insulin regimens differences in HbA1c level may
have been minimized, but at the expense of greater differ-
ences in hypoglycemia and weight gain.
Further research is indicated to evaluate the durability of
the effects of degludec/liraglutide in longer-term studies, in
clinical practice, and to assess whether patients and physi-
cians consider degludec/liraglutide a suitable treatment op-
tion to overcome barriers to treatment intensification.
Conclusions
Among patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes taking
glargine and metformin, treatment with degludec/liraglutide
compared with up-titration of glargine resulted in noninfe-
rior HbA1c levels, with secondary analyses indicating greater
HbA1clevelreductionafter26weeksoftreatment.Furtherstud-
ies are needed to assess longer-term efficacy and safety.
