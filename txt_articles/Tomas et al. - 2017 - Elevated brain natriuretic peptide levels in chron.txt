Objectives To explore levels of the brain natriuretic 
peptide (BNP) and how these associate with the cardiac 
abnormalities recently identified in chronic fatigue 
syndrome (CFS).
Methods Cardiac magnetic resonance examinations were 
performed using 3T Philips Intera Achieva scanner (Best, 
Netherlands) in CFS (Fukuda) participants and sedentary 
controls matched group wise for age and sex. BNP was 
also measured by using an enzyme immunoassay in 
plasma from 42 patients with CFS and 10 controls.
Results BNP levels were significantly higher in the CFS 
cohort compared with the matched controls (P=0.013). 
When we compared cardiac volumes (end-diastolic 
and end-systolic) between those with high BNP levels 
(BNP >400 pg/mL) and low BNP (<400 pg/mL), there were 
significantly lower cardiac volumes in those with the 
higher BNP levels in both end-systolic and end-diastolic 
volumes (P=0.05). There were no relationships between 
fatigue severity, length of disease and BNP levels (P=0.2) 
suggesting that our findings are unlikely to be related to 
deconditioning.
Conclusion This study confirms an association between 
reduced cardiac volumes and BNP in CFS. Lack of 
relationship between length of disease suggests that 
findings are not secondary to deconditioning. Further 
studies are needed to explore the utility of BNP to act 
as a stratification paradigm in CFS that directs targeted 
treatments.

InTROduCTIOn
Studies performed using a range of assess-
ment modalities have shown that chronic 
fatigue syndrome (CFS) is associated with 
abnormalities of cardiac function.1–6 Echo-
cardiographic and impedance studies have 
confirmed impaired cardiac contractility1 2 
and reduced left ventricular function.6 Struc-
tural cardiac magnetic resonance (MR) has 
shown reduced end diastolic dimensions 
and cardiac output with MR spectroscopy 
detecting impaired cardiac bioenergetic 
function3 4 with findings suggestive of a 
subclinical 
cardiomyopathy 
in 
approxi-
mately a third of the CFS cohort (ref). The 
severity of these cardiac abnormalities also 
appears to relate to symptom severity but 
does not appear to be secondary to decondi-
tioning.1 3 5–7 This has led to the suggestion 
that CFS is a small heart syndrome8 9 with 
MR findings consistent, in some patients with 
 
CFS, with cardiac failure picture.

Key questions
What is already known about this subject?
 
► Structural and functional cardiac abnormalities 
have been reported in chronic fatigue 
syndrome (CFS).
 
► Magnetic resonance spectroscopy studies have 
suggested a subclinical cardiomyopathy in some of 
those with CFS.
What does this study add?
 
► Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels were 
significantly higher in CFS compared with matched 
controls.
 
► There were significantly lower cardiac volumes in 
those with higher BNP levels in both end-systolic 
and end-diastolic volumes.
 
► There were no relationships between fatigue 
severity, length of illness and BNP levels confirming 
that our findings are unlikely to be related to 
deconditioning.
How might this impact on clinical practice?
 
► This study confirms an association between 
reduced cardiac volumes and BNP in CFS. Lack of 
relationship between length of disease suggests 
that findings are not secondary to deconditioning. 
Further studies are needed to explore the utility of 
BNP to act as a stratification paradigm in CFS that 
directs targeted treatments.

stretching of heart muscle cells. BNP has been shown to 
be a useful screening and prognostic tool in patients with 
heart failure and is typically found to be increased in 
patients with left ventricular dysfunction, with or without 
symptoms.10–12
The physiological actions of BNP include decrease 
in systemic vascular resistance and central venous pres-
sure as well as an increase in natriuresis. The net effect 
of these peptides is a decrease in blood pressure due to 
the decrease in systemic vascular resistance and thus after 
load. Additionally the actions of BNP result in a decrease 
in cardiac output due to an overall decrease in central 
venous pressure and preload as a result of a reduction in 
blood volume that follows natriuresis and diuresis. The 
utility of BNP as a diagnostic and prognostic stratifica-
tion factor in patients with heart failure has been studied 
extensively.12
The purpose of this study was therefore to measure 
BNP levels in patients with CFS compared with controls 
and to determine whether BNP levels associated with 
impaired cardiac function.
MeTHOds
subjects
Participants were recruited as part of an observational 
study aimed at understanding the pathogenesis of auto-
nomic dysfunction in patients with CFS. The recruitment 
to this study has previously been reported.6 Participants 
fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for CFS.13 In order to 
fulfil these criteria, individuals were required to have 
no comorbidity including normal renal blood tests and 
a normal BMI. Participants were not selected positively 
or negatively according to any criteria other than the 
fact that they were attending a clinical service and had a 
Fukuda diagnosis of CFS,14 although they were excluded 
if they screened positive for a major depressive episode as 
assessed using the Structured Clinical Interview for the 
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders 
(version IV; SCID-IV15). Fatigue impact was assessed by 
the Fatigue Impact Scale.16
Controls were recruited via notices provided in the 
hospital and University together with a distribution of 
posters via the local Patient Support Group where we 
invited relatives of those with CFS to participate. Controls 
fulfilled the same inclusion and exclusion criteria as CFS 
participants, and they were sedentary but otherwise not 
positively or negatively recruited according to fatigue 
severity or the presence or absence of particular symp-
toms. All participants provided written informed consent.
Measurement of brain natriuretic peptide (BnP)
BNP was measured by a researcher blinded to the group 
for each individual sample, using the brain natriuretic 
peptide EIA Kit from Sigma Aldrich (RAB0386). Each 
component of the kit was reconstituted and diluted as 
directed by the manufacturer. Anti-BNP antibody was 
added to each well on the BNP microplate and incubated 
for 1.5 hours at room temperature with gentle shaking 
(1–2 cycles/s). The solution was discarded and each 
well washed thoroughly four times, ensuring complete 
removal of liquid after each wash. Standards and samples 
were added to the microplate. Standards with known 
concentrations of BNP were created from BNP standard 
included in the kit. Twofold dilutions of each plasma 
sample were created by the addition of an equal volume 
of biotinylated BNP peptide to the sample. All standards 
and samples were run in duplicate. The microplate was 
incubated for 2.5 hours at room temperature with gently 
shaking. The solution was discarded and washed again 
as described previously. HRP-streptavidin solution was 
added to each well and the microplate incubated for 
45 min at room temperature with gently shaking. The 
solution was discarded and washed as described previ-
ously. TMB one-step substrate reagent was added to each 
well and incubated for 30 min at room temperature, in 
the dark, with gentle shaking. Stop solution was added 
to each well and the absorbance read on a Tecan infinite 
M200 plate reader at 450 nm. A standard curve was 
created using the standards. The BNP concentration in 
each sample was determined using the standard curve.
This experiment also included a positive control to 
verify the components of the kit are working correctly.
We considered a BNP value of >400 pg/mL as being 
consistent with moderate to severe cardiac disease 
and this was defined prehoc.
Cardiac MR
Cardiac examinations were performed using a 3T Philips 
Intera Achieva scanner (Best, Netherlands). A dedicated 
6-channel cardiac coil (Philips, Best, Netherlands) is used 
with the subjects in a supine position and ECG gating 
(Philips vectorcardiogram, VCG system). Cardiac MR 
cine imaging is acquired to assess cardiac morphology 
and systolic and diastolic function. A stack of balanced 
steady-state free precession images was obtained in the 
short axis view during breath holding covering the entire 
left ventricle (FO=350 mm, TR/TE=3.7/1.9 ms, turbo 
factor 17, flip angle 40°, slice thickness 8 mm, 0 mm gap, 
14 slices, 25 phases, resolution 1.37 mm, temporal dura-
tion approx. 40 ms per phase, dependent on heart rate). 
Image analysis was performed using the cardiac analysis 
package of the ViewForum workstation (Philips, Best, 
Netherlands). Manual tracing of the epicardial and endo-
cardial borders was performed on the short axis slices at 
end-systole and end-diastole by a trained radiographer. 
The algorithm for contour selection and subsequently 
calculating left ventricular mass, systolic and diastolic 
parameters have been detailed elsewhere.17
statistical analysis
Continuous variables were expressed as mean±SD and 
comparisons made using unpaired t-tests where groups 
are matched. Correlation analysis was performed using 
non-parametric testing. Analysis was performed using 
Graphpad, Prism. Multivariate analysis was performed

ResulTs
Cardiac MR and BNP were measured in 42 patients with 
 
CFS  and 10 sedentary controls-matched group wise for 
age and sex. Length of history for the patients with  CFS 
 
was mean 13.8 years (SD 9.8). Cardiac MR measurements 
for the two groups are shown in table 1.
BNP levels were significantly higher in the CFS cohort 
compared with the matched controls (figure 1). When 
we compared cardiac volumes (end-diastolic and end-sys-
tolic) between those with high BNP levels (BNP >400 pg/
mL) and low BNP (<400 pg/mL), there were significantly 
lower cardiac volumes in those with the higher BNP levels 
in both end-systolic and end-diastolic volumes (figure 2). 
There were no differences in age, fatigue severity or 
length of history between the two groups (table 1).
There were no relationships between fatigue severity, 
length of history and BNP levels (P=0.2).
dIsCussIOn
Studies have confirmed in a range of conditions that 
BNP can predict prognosis and detect those with cardiac 
failure. This study has shown that in patients with  CFS, 
a group shown previously to have high levels of subclin-
ical cardiac abnormalities,1–9 that BNP is elevated. Studies 
have also concluded that those with CFS have reduced 
cardiac volumes, the degree of which associates with 
plasma volume.6 In the present study, higher BNP levels 
were also shown to be associated with smaller cardiac 
volumes. The lack of relationship between length of 
disease and BNP levels suggests that our findings are 
unlikely to be secondary to deconditioning.
The association found in this study is interesting. It is 
possible that the smaller cardiac volumes seen in those 
with CFS are causing the elevated BNP levels. However, 
this is counterintuitive, and BNP is usually a sign of cardiac 
ventricular wall strain/stretch and volume overload. In

our study, the BNP was higher in the group with the 
lower cardiac volumes. Another explanation is that the 
higher BNP levels are causing a diuresis (or natriuresis) 
and that this is depleting the plasma/blood volumes and 
leading to the smaller cardiac volumes. Studies from our 
group and others have shown smaller plasma volumes in 
CFS6 7 and studies with patients with orthostatic hypoten-
sion have reported high BNP levels in some patients18 
and have been suggested as potentially causative.
We believe that measurement of BNP could represent 
a tool to identify the 1/3 of patients with CFS who were 
found in previous studies to have impaired cardiac bioen-
ergetic function. Doing this could potentially stratify 
patients with  CFS to more appropriate interventions and 
also facilitate research to identify the particular charac-
teristics of a cardiac phenotype within the overall cohort 
with the diagnosis of CFS. We believe that this kind of 
stratified approach to identifying specific phenotypes 
and facilitating targeted interventions is an important 
step in our understanding of the heterogeneous nature 
of those with CFS.
This study confirms an association between reduced 
cardiac volumes and BNP in CFS. Lack of relationship 
between length of disease suggests that findings are not 
secondary to deconditioning. Further studies are needed 
to explore the utility of BNP to act as a stratification para-
digm in CFS that directs targeted treatments.
