SUMMARY
In the mammalian brain, the anatomical structure of
neural circuits changes little during adulthood. As a
result, adult learning and memory are thought to
result from specific changes in synaptic strength.
A possible exception is the olfactory bulb (OB), where
activity
guides
interneuron
turnover
throughout
adulthood. These adult-born granule cell (GC) inter-
neurons form new GABAergic synapses that have
little synaptic strength plasticity. In the face of persis-
tent neuronal and synaptic turnover, how does the
OB balance flexibility, as is required for adapting to
changing sensory environments, with perceptual
stability? Here we show that high dendritic spine
turnover is a universal feature of GCs, regardless of
their developmental origin and age. We find matching
dynamics among postsynaptic sites on the principal
neurons receiving the new synaptic inputs. We
further demonstrate in silico that this coordinated
structural
plasticity
is
consistent
with
stable,
yet flexible, decorrelated sensory representations.
Together, our study reveals that persistent, coordi-
nated synaptic structural plasticity between inter-
neurons and principal neurons is a major mode of
functional plasticity in the OB.
INTRODUCTION
Synaptic plasticity, the experience-dependent modification of
synaptic strength, constitutes a central paradigm of modern
neuroscience to explain learning and memory at cellular and sub-
cellular levels (Mayford et al., 2012). In contrast, structural plas-
ticity, the formation of new synapses or pruning of existing synap-
ses, remains as an alternative process of unclear significance.
Structural plasticity has been linked to new memory formation
in the adult neocortex (Xu et al., 2009; Yang et al., 2009), albeit
with a very modest degree of synaptic remodeling. In contrast,
robust structural plasticity mainly occurs during brain develop-
ment and is temporally confined to specific postnatal critical
periods (Holtmaat et al., 2005; Zuo et al., 2005). As a result, its
presence in the adult brain is often assumed to be limited.
The olfactory bulb (OB) is one of a few brain regions with prom-
inent structural plasticity (Mizrahi, 2007). In the OB, adult neuro-
genesis continuously replenishes two neuronal populations,
periglomerular and granule cell (GC) interneurons (Alvarez-Buylla
and Lim, 2004; Lois and Alvarez-Buylla, 1994; Whitman and
Greer, 2009), making the OB a compelling model to address
how a neural circuit with substantial structural plasticity can
maintain stable function.
GCs are GABAergic, axonless interneurons that constitute the
largest group of neurons in the OB (Shepherd et al., 2007). They
make specialized dendrodendritic synapses with mitral/tufted
cells (MC/TCs), the principal relay neurons of the OB (Lepousez
et al., 2013; Rall et al., 1966). This bidirectional synaptic structure
conveys both MC/TC excitatory glutamatergic input onto GCs
andreciprocalGABAergic output ontoMC/TCs(Shepherd, 1963).
The development of adult-born GCs has been tracked by his-
tological (Petreanu and Alvarez-Buylla, 2002), physiological
(Carleton et al., 2003), in vitro (Breton-Provencher et al., 2014),
and in vivo imaging methods (Mizrahi, 2007). Chronic in vivo im-
aging has revealed the dynamic stages of periglomerular neuron
dendrite and GC dendritic tip development (Mizrahi, 2007), but
the developmental stages of complete GC dendrites in vivo re-
mains uncharacterized. GC spine dynamics have also been
tracked up to a cell’s age of 3 months, exhibiting �20% daily
turnover (Mizrahi, 2007). However, it is unclear if GC spine dy-
namics, like plasticity of synaptic strength elsewhere in the brain,
are restricted to defined critical periods and stabilize with

 increasing GC age. Similarly, it is unknown if highly dynamic
spines are limited to adult-born GCs, or instead are universal
to all GCs.
Highly dynamic GC spines beg the question of whether synap-
tic reorganization is mirrored by the MC/TC GABAergic postsyn-
aptic structure. In neocortical pyramidal neurons, GABAergic
postsynaptic sites have greater dynamics compared to excit-
atory synapses (Chen et al., 2012; Villa et al., 2016). Therefore,
it is possible that MC/TC synapses have similar plasticity. Alter-
natively, if the MC/TC postsynaptic GABAergic structure is
instead stable, this would suggest GC competition for limited
synapses.
Plasticity in neural circuits must strike a balance between
flexibility and stability so new information can be acquired
while previously learned information can be retained (Fusi
et al., 2005). This is especially relevant in sensory systems
where the representation of a dynamic environment has to
be adaptable, yet reliable. Here, we approached this conun-
drum by tracking the complete development of adult-born

circuit that utilizes structural plasticity as its primary form of
functional plasticity.
RESULTS
For characterizing the complete structural stages of adult-born
GC development in vivo, cells were birth-dated and labeled
with GFP by injecting GFP-expressing virus into the subventric-
ular zone (SVZ), the location of neuroblast proliferation (Fig-
ure 1A). Labeled neuroblasts migrated via the rostral migratory
stream (RMS) to the OB, where two-photon imaging was per-
formed through a cranial window. The birthdating of adult-born
neurons was confirmed by immunohistological analysis. Double-
cortin (DCX)-positive GFP neuroblasts appeared in the posterior
RMS up to 7 days postinjection (dpi) but were absent by 14 dpi,
demonstrating pulsed labeling of a cohort of neuroblasts (see
Figure S1A available online). By 42 dpi, the cells differentiated

 with a GC morphology and expressed a mature neuronal marker
(Figure S1B).
Cranial windows were made over the OB, and blood vessel
patterns remained stable for over 2 months after surgery (Fig-
ure S1C). To determine the potential invasiveness of the cranial
window surgery (Lee et al., 2008; Xu et al., 2007), the OB was
stained for markers of gliosis (GFAP) and microglia (Iba-1) in
no-window controls, at 14 and 28 days after window surgery,
and 10 days after ‘‘failed windows,’’ serving as a positive control
(Figure S1D). Quantification of the immunofluorescence showed
no change in Iba-1 immunoreactivity (Figure S1E) but a signifi-
cant increase in GFAP (Figure S1F) in 14 days after window
surgery and failed window groups. There was no statistical dif-
ference in GFAP between no-window and 28 days postwindow
groups (p = 0.25). To insure minimal impact of the surgery on
OB physiology, all imaging series started at least 1 month after
cranial window surgery (Holtmaat et al., 2009).
Adult-Born GC Dendrites Elaborate in a Stereotypical
Manner
To track the initial integration events of newborn GCs arriving
into the OB, experiments were performed as outlined in Fig-
ure 1B. Two-photon image stacks were acquired every 2 days
(Movie S1) from first detection of cells (�12 dpi). The same
GCs were traced in 3D over multiple time points, showing the
evolution of their morphology with synaptic integration (Fig-
ure 1C). Given the heterogeneity in neuroblast arrival times to
the OB (Petreanu and Alvarez-Buylla, 2002), each individual
GC was time normalized at the dpi where the total dendritic
length initially plateaued (23.2 ± 1.4 dpi; hereafter all values indi-
cate mean ± SEM). Additionally, there was high diversity be-
tween individual GCs in their mature total dendritic lengths,
therefore each GC was normalized with 100% being the individ-
ual dendritic length average between 36 and 58 dpi (Figure 1D,
average 902.9 ± 62.4 mm). GCs had a mean growth rate of
�12% of their saturated length per day (Figure 1E, n = 3 animals,
14 GCs and 174 tracings).
Scholl analysis was performed showing an initial suggestion of
dendritic overshoot at �24 dpi, with refined stability by 30 dpi
(Figures S1G and S1H). The total dendritic length remained high-
ly stable after 1 month postinjection (mpi), in addition to individ-
ual dendritic segments becoming stable (Figures 1F and 1G,
n = 3 animals, 13 dendritic segments, and 210 tracings). The
adult born GC population was also tracked with the highest num-
ber of cells existing at 24 dpi, peak cell death occurred at 26 dpi
(�2.5% loss/day) and from 24 to 56 dpi, the total cell number
declined at �0.7% per day (n = 2 animals, 85 cells; 24–56 dpi
linear fit R2 = 0.96).
Spine Dynamics of Adult-Born GCs Evolve during
Integration and Saturate
Using the same experimental timeline as in Figure 1B, GC spine
dynamics were tracked. The first spines appeared at �18 dpi
(Figure 2A; 17.9 ± 1.0 dpi), similar to observations in fixed brain
sections (Petreanu and Alvarez-Buylla, 2002). GC dendritic seg-
ments and spines were traced in 3D to track dynamic changes
(Figures 2B and S2A–S2C). The number of new spines was high-
est during the initial stage of GC dendrite formation, up to 1 mpi
(Figure 2C, n = 11 animals, 23 dendritic segments, 253 tracings,
and 3,638 spines). After this period, the number of new and of
lost spines decreased, while that of stable spines gradually
increased. Three phases were binned at 22–30, 40–48, and
64–72 dpi, showing a significant increase in stable spines and
a gradual decrease in new and lost spines with increasing age
of the adult-born GCs (Figure 2D, 22–30 dpi: stable, 33.5% ±
1.2%, new, 33.7% ± 1.3%, lost, 32.9% ± 0.7%, n = 4 animals,

developmental periods showed a gradual increase in stable
spines, but generally a very dynamic mix of short-lived spines
persisted (Figure 2E; Movie S2). Overall, the percentage of
dynamic spines consisted �40% of the population at 2 mpi.
A control experiment confirmed the rapid spine turnover was
not the result of repeated 2-day interval, anesthetized imaging
(Figures S2D–S2F).
Adult-Born GC Spines Maintain High Structural
Plasticity throughout Life
Are the high dynamics of dendritic spines on adult-born GC
maintained throughout the life of a given cell? GC precursors
were labeled as outlined in Figure 3A. In addition, cranial win-
dows were made over the motor cortex of Thy-1-GFP-M mice
to compare directly spine dynamics of neocortical pyramidal
cells and adult-born GCs. Spine stability, as a function of GC
age, saturated at �2 mpi with �60% stability (Figures 3B and
3C, data combined with Figure 2D, first three time point values;
3 mpi: 57.5% ± 2.0%, n = 3 mice, 12 dendrites, 60 tracings and
624 spines; 4 mpi: 58.8% ± 1.8%, n = 3 mice, 7 dendrites, 26
tracings and 349 spines; 6 mpi: 61.0% ± 1.7%, n = 3 mice, 7 den-
drites, 18 tracings and 232 spines; 14 mpi: 66.8% ± 2.6%, n = 3
mice, 7 dendrites, 14 tracings and 183 spines; Thy-1-M: 98.8% ±
0.4%, n = 2 mice, 23 dendrites, 52 tracings and 142 spines; 22–
30 dpi versus all mpi p < 0.01, 40–48 dpi versus all mpi p < 0.05,
14 mpi versus neocortex p = 1.2 3 10–9, ANOVA). From 2 to 14
mpi, the spines were significantly more stable than spines at 1
and 1.5 mpi. Between 3, 4, 6, and 14 mpi groups, despite a
gradual trend toward higher stability with the age of the GC,
the stability was not significantly different. Additionally, adult-
born GC spines were consistently more dynamic than adult
neocortical pyramidal cell spines (Figure 3C). These results indi-
cate that adult-born GC spines likely retain elevated dynamics
throughout the cell’s life.
Using a 2-day interval imaging undersampled faster spine
movement, therefore we also imaged 3, 5, and 18 mpi GCs
and adult neocortical pyramidal cells at a 10 min interval
(90 min total, Figure S3). GCs had numerous highly dynamic
spines with a filopodia-like morphology (Figure S3B, open arrow-
heads 1, 2, and 4). Additionally, mushroom-like spines had fine
dynamic protrusions on established spine heads (Figure S3A,
open arrowhead 1). Even in 18 mpi GCs, these highly motile
structures were observed (Figure S3C). Enhanced short-term
spine dynamics were ubiquitous in all observed GCs (Movie
S3) and were absent in neocortical pyramidal cell spines (Fig-
ure S3D; Movie S4). Quantification of spines that showed signif-
icant morphological change during the 90 min period (new, lost,
or filopodia-like extensions off of existing spines), showed a
similar rate with the 2-day interval results, having 66.0% ±
4.3% stable and 34.0% ± 4.3% dynamic spines, indicating a
relatively constant rate of gain and loss (n = 3 animals, 12 den-
drites, and 344 spines).
Adult-Born and Early Postnatal-Born GCs Exhibit
Identical Rate of Spine Turnover
The OB undergoes latent development with most growth occur-
ring within the early postnatal period and plateaus by adulthood
(Pomeroy et al., 1990). Previous studies demonstrated adult-
born GCs to have unique properties in comparison to the early
postnatal-born GC population (Alonso et al., 2012; Lemasson
et al., 2005; Valley et al., 2013). We therefore explored whether
dynamic spines were restricted to adult-born GCs. Postnatal
day 14 (P14) mice were injected with the same GFP-expressing
virus, along with a cohort of mice injected at postnatal day 70
(P70) for labeling adult-born GCs as outlined in Figure 4A.
When comparing the spine dynamics between the adult and
early postnatal-born GCs, there was �60% stability at a 2-day
interval, which was not statistically different between groups
(Figures 4B and 4C; P70: n = 4 mice, 19 dendrites, 973 spines,
stable: 58.0% ± 1.4%, new: 21.9% ± 1.2%, lost: 20.1% ±
1.3%; P14: n = 4 mice, 14 dendrites, 522 spines, stable:
58.2% ± 2.7%, new: 22.5% ± 1.7%, lost: 19.3% ± 1.5%; P70

respectively.

origin, have highly dynamic spines throughout life.
Postsynaptic Dynamics of Gephyrin in Principal OB
Neurons
The high amount of GC spine turnover could require matching
plasticity in the postsynaptic site along the MC/TC lateral
dendrite, or alternatively, GC spines may compete for fixed syn-
aptic sites. We monitored GABAergic post-synaptic sites by
two-photon in vivo imaging of fluorescently tagged gephyrin
(teal-gephyrin; Figure 5A), an obligate scaffolding protein en-
riched at GABAergic synapses (Specht et al., 2013; Tyagarajan
and Fritschy, 2010). Lentiviral vectors that conditionally ex-
pressed teal-gephyrin were injected directly into the OB of cre-
driver mice (Tbet-Cre) (Haddad et al., 2013) to target expression
to MCs and TCs (Figure 5B), the only output neurons in the OB.
Imaging the volume in the injection area revealed sparse expres-
sion, which enabled reconstruction of neuronal morphology (Fig-
ure 5C). All fully reconstructed neurons had the morphological
characteristics of MC/TCs: primary dendrites that branched
into single glomeruli, and multiple spineless secondary dendrites
with broad axial ramifications in the external plexiform layer (Fig-
ures 5E and 5F). Consistent with previous in vivo observations,
we found no evidence of dynamics in the MC/TC dendritic struc-
ture (Mizrahi and Katz, 2003). From in vivo z stacks (n = 7 mice),
38 reconstructed neurons were classified as either MCs (n = 20)
or TCs (n = 18) based on somatic depth (Figure 5D).
To determine if teal-gephyrin was enriched at synapses, we
quantified the immunohistochemical colocalization of teal-ge-
phyrin with endogenous synaptic proteins. It was previously
reported that GABAA receptors on MCs and TCs contain the
alpha-1 subunit of the GABAA receptor and not the alpha-2 sub-
unit (Panzanelli et al., 2007). As expected, we found that in
MC/TCs teal-gephyrin puncta colocalized with the alpha-1 (Fig-
ures S4A and S4C) but not the alpha-2 GABAA receptor subunit
(Figures S4B and S4C).
MC/TCs lack morphologically distinct postsynaptic structures
such as spines that can experimentally assist the identification
and registration of postsynaptic fluorescent labels (Chen et al.,
2012; van Versendaal et al., 2012). Therefore, to track the dy-
namics of puncta over multiple days of observation, we devel-
oped an automated workflow to detect postsynaptic puncta on
smooth dendrites from a time series of two-photon imaged
volumes (Figure S5). We discriminated between real puncta
movement versus nonbiological optical changes by comparing
images acquired at 10 min intervals—a scale with negligible
gross rearrangement to gephyrin assemblies (Dobie and Craig,
2011) (Figure S5A)—and 1-day intervals (Figure S5B; quantified
in Figure S5C). We measured a similar rate of gain and loss
over four 10 min observations (Figures S5D and S5E) which con-
trasted with significantly larger changes between 1-day interval
observations over a period of 4 days (Figures S5D and S5E).
Our algorithmic detection of puncta dynamics was robust to
changes in various detection parameters (Figures S5F and
S5G) and was validated by human scoring (Figure S5H).
Inferring the Age of New and Lost Gephyrin Puncta
Puncta were classified by age (Figure 6A). Our dataset is marked
by puncta at, or near, the optical point spread function of the mi-
croscope where the size of the gephyrin scaffold is best reflected
by puncta intensity. As a result, we looked at the peak intensity of
teal-gephyrin puncta in order to gain insights regarding the age
and strength of the synapses that were gained and lost. We
found that the peak intensity of newly-formed puncta was initially
dim and increased over time (Figure 6B; Movie S6), whereas sta-
ble puncta were considerably brighter and did not change inten-
sity over 8 consecutive days of observation (Figures 6B and 6C).
Because the short lifetime of dim puncta could be explained by
the increased likelihood of dim puncta to disappear below the
threshold of detection, we repeated our analysis using different
detection thresholds (also see Figures S5F and S5G) but found
no change in the slope or half-max of the logistic fit (1/2 max:
0.5% threshold, 6.1 ± 0.2 days; 1.0% threshold, 5.7 ±
0.3 days; 2.0% threshold, 6.0 ± 0.3 days; mean ± SE, Figure 6C).
Logistic growth of puncta intensity suggests that gephyrin
recruitment to the post-synaptic density saturates over several
weeks, which may indicate a time dependence of synaptic
strength following synaptogenesis.
In our dataset, 64% of lost puncta (1,222/1,899) were pre-exist-
ing, meaning they were observed from the first day of imaging.
This subpopulation of lost pre-existing puncta was significantly

MC/TC Gephryin Puncta Dynamics Mirror GC Spine
Dynamics
To estimate the overall dynamics of gephyrin puncta, we focused
our analysis on puncta that persist for two or more observations
to exclude spurious false positives resulting from our automated
detection. The 10 min observation gain/loss was used as a base-
line to calculate the real turnover in different types of dendrites.
We chronically imaged volumes for 4–8 consecutive days and
extracted 56 dendrite segments from MC and TC secondary
dendrites (30 MC segments, 26 TC segments; mean length:
77.8 ± 19.7 mm; average 50.4 ± 29.0 puncta per segment).
Both groups exhibited a similar 1-day interval rate of puncta
addition (% new puncta per day: TC, 7.0% ± 3.6%; MC,
6.1% ± 4.6%; p = 0.42; Figure 6D), puncta loss (% lost puncta
per day: TC, 7.0% ± 3.4%; MC, 6.0% ± 3.4%; p = 0.30; Figure 6D)
and puncta stability (% stable puncta per day: TC, 86.0% ±
0.9%; MC, 87.9% ± 1.2%; p = 0.22; Figure 6D). To correlate
puncta with GC spine dynamics, single observation spines
were also excluded. We found no statistical difference between
the MC/TC puncta and GC spine dynamics, suggesting matched
dynamics between the synaptic partners (n = 4 mice, 22 den-
drites and 463 spines, % GC new spines per day: 5.1% ±
0.9%; p = 0.12 versus MC/TC; % GC lost: 5.7% ± 1.0%; p =
0.40 versus MC/TC; % GC stable: 89.2% ± 1.0%; p = 0.18
versus MC/TC; ANOVA; Figure 6D).
Functional Consequences of Persistent Structural
Plasticity
What is the function of high synapse turnover, and how can a
persistently remodeled OB output stable sensory representa-
tions? We addressed these questions in a linear rate model (Fig-
ure 7A). Model MCs (NMC = 120) were driven by odor-evoked
glomerular activation maps (Johnson and Leon, 2007) and
excited GCs (NGC = 2,000), which returned reciprocal inhibition.
To reproduce the experimentally observed synapse turnover, the
MC end of a subset of the reciprocal synapses was replaced
every Dt = 3 hr. We first implemented a minimal update rule:
random replacement at a constant rate (‘‘Poisson model’’).
The OB transforms its inputs into reformatted MC output pat-
terns. Using Pearson’s distance (Figure 7B), we therefore quan-
tified how much model output differed from input for a set of 12
odors (the ‘‘odor environment’’) and rejected models with too
small I/O-distance dI/O < 0.05. Background synaptic plasticity
can degrade stored memory (Fusi and Abbott, 2007; Fusi
et al., 2005). Indeed, the Poisson model erased any initially
stored I/O function (See Supplemental Experimental Proce-
dures) within a few simulated days and always evolved toward
a random configuration (‘‘Poisson network’’) with dI/O < 0.032
(n = 1440/1440 = 36 stimuli 3 40 circuits; Figures 7C and S7A).
Older Synapses Are More Stable
Since the Poisson networks’ failure to reshape their inputs is at
odds with known OB properties (Friedrich and Laurent, 2001;
Gschwend et al., 2015), we reanalyzed the experimental data.
For a homogeneous Poisson process, which is context and his-
tory agnostic, the replacement rate of a synapse would be inde-
pendent of its age. We analyzed spines of mature GCs over
12 days (seven 2-day interval sessions). Spines not observed
at the first session were classified as young. At each session
each young spine was assigned an age according to the number
of consecutive sessions in which the spine was previously de-
tected. When branches were pooled, the 2-day survival rate,
i.e., the probability still to be observed at the next session,
increased significantly with spine age (Figure 7D, colored bars;
p = 3.0 3 10�3, Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient). Corrob-
orating this trend, the 2-day survival rate of young spines was
less than that of all spines for each individual branch in the data-
set (n = 13; Figure S7B). MC/TC puncta showed the same trend
(Figure S7C; p = 3.0 3 10�3, Spearman’s rank correlation

 coefficient), with smaller effect size, possibly due to the
shorter total observation period. In summary, synapse stability
increased with GC spine and MC/TC puncta age.
Hebbian, Activity-Dependent Survival Stabilizes Older
Synapses
Differential survival rates may originate from the maturation or
heterogeneity of synapses, or from modulatory factors such as
neuronal activity. The latter is suggested by reduced turnover
in odor-enriched conditions (Livneh and Mizrahi, 2012). We
therefore built a new model with activity-dependent synapse
survival.
At each time step, the product of the responses of any con-
nected MC-GC pair was calculated for each odor in the environ-
ment. Because these products are large for cells that fire
together, their sum over all odors measures the Hebbianness of
the connection, and a running average defined the ‘‘resilience’’
of the synapse. In the subsequent connectivity update, low-resil-
ience synapses were more likely to have their MCs replaced with
randomly chosen other MCs (Figure S7D). This ‘‘Hebbian model’’
showed continual synapse turnover and, for suitably chosen pa-
rameters, reproduced the observed increase in synapse stability
with synapse age with high accuracy (Figure 7D, gray bars).
Hebbian Networks Generate Stable Stimulus
Representations
Odor experience shaped ‘‘Hebbian networks’’ that, unlike Pois-
son networks, consistently transformed their inputs (steady-
state dI/O = 0.206 ± 0.004, mean ± SEM, n = 336 = 24
odors 3 14 circuits; Figure 7B). However, because of the highly
volatile circuit connectivity, it was unclear whether output odor
representations were stable. We quantified output stability us-
ing the Pearson correlation r64 between the response vectors
at times t and t-64 days. For fixed olfactory environment, GC
responses strongly fluctuated throughout the simulation (Fig-
ure 7E, blue trace). By contrast, after an initial transient, MC
output reliably stabilized with r64 near unity (Figure 7E, black
trace).
How can a volatile circuit generate stable output? Two troughs
flanking the central peak of the average autocorrelation of MC
response time courses (Figure S7E) hinted at a negative feed-
back loop counteracting temporal fluctuations. Suggestively,
the temporal waveforms of the MC response and of the number
of GC synapses received by the same MC, which was propor-
tional to GC-mediated inhibition, were highly anticorrelated
(average Pearson correlation: r < �0.99). The average cross-cor-
relogram between MC response and average resilience of con-
nected synapses (Figure S7F) suggested that an increased MC
response enhances the resilience and thus the number of con-
nected synapses. The resulting added inhibition rebalances the
MC response. This negative feedback loop also compensated
partially for slow fluctuations in input representations (Figures
7F and S7G), which may, for example, result from olfactory re-
ceptor neuron (ORN) turnover (Graziadei and Graziadei, 1979).
By contrast, in the Poisson model, synaptic fluctuations exacer-
bated input fluctuations. Thus, despite the volatility of input and
connectivity, Hebbian, but not Poisson, plasticity kept output
representations stable.
Hebbian Networks Decorrelate Stimulus
Representations
GABAergic activity is pivotal to several OB computations (Lledo
and Lagier, 2006). Among these, pattern decorrelation enhances
odor discrimination in the early learning phase (Gschwend et al.,
2015), and facilitates presumed downstream computations
(Friedrich and Wiechert, 2014; Gschwend et al., 2015; Wick

 et al., 2010; Wiechert et al., 2010). To probe whether spine turn-
over and pattern decorrelation may be related, we exposed the
Hebbian model to a 12-odor environment. MC representations
adapted reliably, substantially reducing the average output
pattern correlation between pairs of similar odors (input Pearson
correlation > 0.6; Figures 7G, S7H, and S7I). In a series of models
with gradually relaxed selectivity of the Hebbian rule (see Sup-
plemental Experimental Procedures), the age dependence of
spine survival and the decorrelation of odor representations
decreased in parallel (Figure S7J).
Stimulus Features that Determine Network Structure
Does the Hebbian network adapt to specific features of the odor
environment? For each glomerulus, we collated the vector of
ORN responses to each odor in the environment. Given a
pair of MCs and associated glomeruli, the similarity of these

 ‘‘response profiles’’ (Figure 7H) predicted the weight of mutual
disynaptic inhibition between the MCs (Figure 7I, top) in the
Hebbian (Figure 7J, black dots; r = 0.678) but not the Poisson
model (Figure 7I, bottom; Figure 7J, gray dots; r = �0.055).
This elevated mutual inhibition between similarly tuned MCs
suggests a decorrelation mechanism similar to that in Chow
and colleagues’s work (Chow et al., 2012).
DISCUSSION
Using in vivo imaging of the OB, we characterized the develop-
ment of adult-born GCs, the dynamics of adult-born versus early
postnatal-derived GC spines, and the dynamics of their synaptic
partners. We found that all GCs retained highly dynamic spines,
independent of their origin, and these dynamics were mirrored
by gephyrin puncta turnover in MC/TC postsynaptic partners.
Despite these high dynamics, our modeling demonstrates that
a structurally dynamic network can maintain stable odor repre-
sentations while also allowing the circuit to reliably adapt to novel
odor environments.
Adult-Born GC Dendritic Integration and Stability in
the OB
For the first time, we show in vivo the complete development of
individually tracked adult-born GCs. Previous in vivo studies
concentrated on more superficial OB structures, measuring
changes in periglomerular neuron dendrites and cell turnover
along with GC distal dendritic segments and spines, including
glutamatergic synaptic puncta changes (Adam and Mizrahi,
2011; Kopel et al., 2012; Livneh and Mizrahi, 2012, 2011; Mizrahi,
2007; Mizrahi et al., 2006). The complete GC structure, however,
had not been tracked.
Adult-born GC dendritic development has also been charac-
terized histologically using a population average to cluster den-
dritic morphology into five developmental stages (Petreanu
and Alvarez-Buylla, 2002). Due to variable neuroblast migration
times to the OB, this approach entails a blurring of birth dates.
In vivo imaging allowed us to detect the arrival of each individual
immature GC into the OB (�10–28 dpi), providing greater accu-
racy in tracking morphological changes. With histological
methods, the first cells were shown to enter the OB between 7
and 13 dpi as class 2 cells (Petreanu and Alvarez-Buylla,
2002). We first detected fluorescent cells in the OB at 10 dpi,
later than with histological methods. This difference is likely
due to the GFP fluorescence being weak in very immature cells,
coupled with the cells’ deep location in the OB (>500 mm),
causing it to be below the in vivo imaging detection threshold.
We observed a �12% growth per day of the GC dendrites with
the maximum length plateauing at �23 dpi. Thereafter, the den-
dritic structure remained stable up to 60 dpi. These results sug-
gest
a
stereotypical
sequence
driving
GC
morphological
changes to maturity, similar to that observed in adult-born neu-
rons in the hippocampus in vivo and with serial reconstruction
imaging (Gonc
¸ alves et al., 2016; Sun et al., 2013). Synaptic in-
puts to the GC basal dendrites, primarily from top-down centrif-
ugal fibers and MC/TC collaterals, become active at 10 dpi, and
this activity may drive the maturation steps (Kelsch et al., 2008;
Whitman and Greer, 2007). In contrast, in periglomerular neu-
rons, sensory deprivation at 10 dpi had no effect on dendritic
maturation (Mizrahi, 2007), whereas odor enrichment caused a
doubling in the total dendritic length of the periglomerular neu-
rons in enriched zones (Livneh et al., 2009). Further in vivo
studies with activity manipulation during dendritic development
would be of great interest to determine how strongly activity
drives dendrite maturation.
We also tracked GCs with a peak in total number at 24 dpi,
a maximum in cell death at 26 dpi, and a gradual 0.66% per
day decline in total GCs. These results may appear to contrast
previous studies utilizing bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) where total
cells peaked at 15 dpi with half disappearing by 1 month (Mouret
et al., 2008; Winner et al., 2002). BrdU histology has higher sensi-
tivity compared in vivo imaging of GFP-labeled cells, thus we had
a lower probability of detecting faint, deep neuroblasts. There-
fore, our in vivo results suggest that cell death mainly occurs
before neuroblasts elaborate and differentiate into GCs. We
did observe the disappearance of fully matured GCs, albeit this
occurred rarely.
GC Spines Are Highly Structurally Plastic Irrespective of
Their Origin and Age
We imaged the evolution of spine dynamics as GCs developed to
beyond 2 months of age. The spines were first (22–30 dpi) highly
motile with comparable dynamics between new, stable, and
eliminated spines. Beyond 30 dpi, spines gradually stabilized.
Interestingly, this timing correlates with the formation of the first
functional GABAergic output of adult-born GCs (Bardy et al.,
2010). By 60 dpi, the spine dynamics saturated to 60% stability
at a 2-day interval, in agreement with previous in vivo studies
(Kopel et al., 2012; Mizrahi, 2007). These matching results are
also important since we used oncoretrovirus for GFP expression,
whereas the previous studies used lentivirus, indicating the
choice of virus had no effect on the dynamics.
In our study, we show for the first time that these dynamics
were sustained (>14 mpi) and thus essentially exist throughout
the life of the GC. This highly dynamic state is unique when
compared to our observation of pyramidal cell spines in
neocortex, which had highly stable spines. Other studies
demonstrated neocortical pyramidal cell spines to have a 1%–
2% turnover at a 3-day interval (Grutzendler et al., 2002). To
contrast brain regions, a turnover of 25% of spines, as occurs
in less than 2 days in the OB, took 18 months in neocortical py-
ramidal cells (Zuo et al., 2005).
Adult-born GCs differ in many respects from GCs formed
during development. Their somas are clustered deeper in the
GC layer (Lemasson et al., 2005), they have a distinct pattern
of synaptic integration into the OB compared to early post-
natal-born GCs (Kelsch et al., 2008), they exhibit distinct survival
rates (Lemasson et al., 2005), and their GABAergic output ex-
hibits less synaptic depression (Valley et al., 2013). In addition,
adult-born GC survival is sensitive to olfactory learning (Mouret
et al., 2009) and has a role in perceptual learning (Moreno
et al., 2009), long-term memory (Lazarini et al., 2009), and fear
conditioning (Valley et al., 2009). Finally, specific stimulation of
adult-born GCs enhanced olfactory learning (Alonso et al.,
2012). Our results show, however, that robust structural plas-
ticity is common to early postnatally and adult born GCs: both
392
Neuron 91, 384–396, July 20, 2016
 retain highly dynamic spines throughout life. With the regular
influx of new GCs into the OB, it is conceivable that the entire
GC population must be highly dynamic to be compatible with
synaptic integration of the new adult-born population. Similar
heightened dynamics were reported in pyramidal cells of the
developing cortex (Holtmaat et al., 2005; Zuo et al., 2005).
Thus, the adult OB may operate in a persistently immature state.
Interestingly, CA1 neuron spines were found to have higher
dynamics than within neocortex, showing diversity in structural
plasticity between brain regions (Attardo et al., 2015). Since
the hippocampus undergoes adult neurogenesis within the den-
tate gyrus, neuronal circuits associated with neurogenic regions
may have heightened structural plasticity.
MC/TC Gephyrin Puncta Are Highly Dynamic along
Lateral Dendrites
When structural remodeling of synaptic connections occurs in
cortical regions, dynamics are observed in both axonal boutons
and dendritic spines (De Paola et al., 2006; Knott et al., 2006; Zuo
et al., 2005). In these regions, neither pre- nor postsynaptic cells
undergo replacement through adult neurogenesis, and so syn-
aptic dynamics likely function to remap connectivity. In contrast,
in the OB, neuronal turnover through adult neurogenesis forces
some rate of synapse loss. Thus, the dynamics in the OB may
reflect the re-establishment of specific synaptic connectivity.
Without observing paired dynamics between M/T and GCs, we
cannot directly assess if circuit connectivity is remapped.
However, in the absence of a plausible mechanism to tag and
reconnect GCs and M/Ts, matched dynamics likely reflects the
establishment of new connectivity.
If structural dynamics remap GABAergic connectivity in the
OB, what leads and regulates this process? While we propose
it is unlikely to be random and may be regulated by a Hebbian
rule (see below), it is unclear what this means mechanistically.
Possibly, incoming sensory excitatory activity may stabilize
specific spines (Livneh and Mizrahi, 2012). Alternatively, GCs
may lead structural dynamics, which could be determined by
simultaneously imaging GABAergic release machinery and
PSD-95 post-synaptic scaffolds, similar to what was recently
demonstrated in sensory cortex (Villa et al., 2016). Ultimately,
untangling the sequence of dynamic changes at the GC-MC/
TC reciprocal synapse may require new technical innovations,
including maturing super-resolution imaging techniques in vivo,
and developing a wider toolbox of spectrally separable synap-
tic labels.
Cortical interneuron classes may project GABAergic synap-
ses onto spatially restricted subdomains of the principal neuron
dendritic arbor (DeFelipe, 1997; Karube et al., 2004; Markram
et al., 2004; Somogyi et al., 1998). In contrast, we found no
evidence that GCs concentrate their GABAergic output to spe-
cific subregions of the MC/TC lateral dendrite (e.g., near-so-
matic versus distal) in contrast to a previous report (Bartel
et al., 2015), and we found no difference in dynamics in
different compartments. Nonetheless, our spatially restricted
analysis cannot rule out higher-order patterning of turnover,
such as clustered turnover dynamics and intermittent turnover
at the same location, as described in mouse cortex (Chen
et al., 2012; Villa et al., 2016).
At the molecular scale it remains unclear what underlies the
dynamics we observed among teal-gephyrin puncta. Gephyrin
rafts can undergo diffusive or coordinated movement, and
they can fracture or combine (Dobie and Craig, 2011). Simi-
larly, GABAA receptors undergoing surface diffusion from
extrasynaptic sites can be trapped by gephyrin densities
(Bogdanov et al., 2006; Meier et al., 2001; Triller and Choquet,
2005). Postsynaptic scaffold proteins may gradually accumu-
late following synaptogenesis, resulting in a correlation be-
tween postsynaptic morphology and synapse lifetime (Cane
et al., 2014; van Versendaal et al., 2012; Yasumatsu et al.,
2008). Both pre- and postsynaptic size can also be modified
during synaptic plasticity as a means of increasing synaptic
strength (Bannai et al., 2009; Bourne and Harris, 2012), and
the size of the post-synaptic gephyrin density has been
shown to directly relate to the number of receptors docked
in the membrane (Specht et al., 2013), thus determining
GABAergic quantal strength (Nusser et al., 1997). Our data
suggest that gephyrin puncta age correlates with synaptic
size and, by extension, synaptic maturity and synaptic
strength. In addition, we found that puncta intensity did not
predict puncta loss. Therefore, as with spine dynamics, post-
synaptic remodeling does not appear to be a feature exclusive
to young, immature synaptic contacts. It remains to be seen
whether gephyrin dynamics on M/T cells can be modulated
in an activity-dependent fashion, as has been observed previ-
ously (Bannai et al., 2009).
OB Structural Plasticity Supports Stable Odor
Representations and Adaptive Decorrelation
We observed synapse dynamics that systematically deviated
from a homogeneous Poisson process but were well reproduced
by a Hebbian learning rule. In our modeling this rule led to stable
output representations and substantial pattern decorrelation.
The likely mechanism underlying pattern decorrelation requires
GCs to connect specific MCs whose identities depend on unpre-
dictably emerging relevant stimuli. We propose that the unusu-
ally high level of structural plasticity in the OB may enable GCs
to efficiently find and connect to MCs with similar response
profiles. Moreover, since this structural plasticity occurs over
just a few days, it may also be utilized in olfactory perceptual
learning where the network is required to adapt to changes in
odor environment (Moreno et al., 2009).
Structural Plasticity May Be the Dominant Form of
Plasticity in Dendrodendritic Synapses
Evidence for long-term potentiation (LTP) in the dendrodendritic
synapse is lacking (Dietz and Murthy, 2005; Gao and Strow-
bridge, 2009). Short-term synaptic plasticity has been observed
at this synapse (Dietz and Murthy, 2005) along with spike-timing
dependent long-term depression with the activation of both
proximal inputs and distal dendrites (Gao and Strowbridge,
2009). Our evidence of matching GC and MC/TC structural
plasticity in vivo, combined with our model showing structural
plasticity being ideal for connecting MCs with similar response
profiles, suggests that the dendrodendritic synapse may rely
on structural plasticity to function in the network without
requiring synaptic strength plasticity.
Neuron 91, 384–396, July 20, 2016
393
 Due to the persistent influx of newborn neurons to the OB,
the dendrodendritic synapse seems adapted to employ struc-
tural plasticity as a primary form of plasticity, consistent with
this synapse having limited synaptic plasticity. We observed
small protrusions rapidly extending and retracting from the
dendritic shaft and off of pre-existing mushroom-like spines
(Breton-Provencher et al., 2014), termed ‘‘spinules,’’ in various
brain regions (Schuster et al., 1990). These protrusions sug-
gest a regular sampling of the local environment as a potential
form of synaptic competition (Spacek and Harris, 2004). In
contrast to the neocortex or hippocampus where silent synap-
ses provide a reservoir of new potential functional connectiv-
ity, dendrodendritic synapses have comparatively few silent
members (Balu et al., 2007). Instead, by using a large search
radius around a dendrite, the extensive spine dynamics may
enable efficient remapping in the sparsely connected OB
network, providing a larger number of potential synaptic part-
ners than would be available to a neuron with a limited pool of
silent synapses. Therefore, we would like to conclude that
structural plasticity offers a more efficient mechanism in this
context.

virus expressing a gephyrin-teal fusion (Ubiquitin-C-Teal-gephyrin) (Chen
et al., 2012). Glass cranial windows 1.0 3 1.2 mm over each or one 3.0 3

GCs were imaged with a Ti:Sapphire femtosecond pulsed laser (910 nm,
Coherent) coupled to a LSM 510 microscope with a 203 1.0 NA objective
(Zeiss). Fluorescent-tagged gephyrin puncta were two-photon imaged
(915 nm, Spectra Physics) with an Ultima microscope (Bruker) with a 253
1.05 NA objective (Olympus).
Image Processing and Analysis
GCs were semiautomatically traced in 3D using Imaris software (Bitplane).
Percent
total
spines
were
calculated
as
stable,
ð1003ðNstable spines=
Ntotal spinesÞÞ; new, ð1003ðNnew spines=Ntotal spinesÞÞ; and lost, ð1003ðNlost spines=
Ntotal spinesÞÞ, where Ntotal spines = Nstable spines + Nnew spines + Nlost spines. Data
are presented as mean ± SEM. Statistical analysis was performed using
one-way ANOVA with Origin software (OriginLab).
For the MC/TC puncta experiments, images were registered using affine and
b-spline transformations, and dendritic segments were manually extracted.
Puncta were automatically detected using Gaussian point detection, and
puncta were linked between days if the fitted centroid moved less than a
defined detection radius (1.44 mm unless otherwise specified). To count as
new, puncta must have had at least two consecutive observations, and spines
in Figure 6D also had this criterion applied.
Spine and Puncta Age Analysis
Spines and puncta whose formation (i.e., a frame where they were detected
preceded by a frame where they were not detected) was observed were as-
signed the age a in units of interimaging intervals where a is the number of
consecutive observations preceding the reference session. For Figures 7D
and S7C, the frequencies of spines/puncta of a given age were corrected for
bias in favor of younger ages. For example, assuming a seven-session analysis
window, age a = 5 can only be observed at the last session, whereas age a = 0
can be observed at any session except the very first. To simplify statistical
analysis this correction was not applied to Figure S7B.
Computational Model of Spine Dynamics
The computational model is described in the Supplemental Experimental
Procedures.
