In Brief
Drugs of abuse, such as cocaine, induce
changes in reward circuitry, which
manifest as long-lasting changes in
behavior. Lewitus et al. demonstrate that
microglia respond to cocaine by releasing
TNF-a, which acts to mitigate cocaine-
induced synaptic and behavioral
changes.

SUMMARY
Repeated administration of cocaine results in the
development of behavioral sensitization, accompa-
nied by a decrease in excitatory synaptic strength
in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) through an unknown
mechanism. Furthermore, glial cells in the NAc are
activated by drugs of abuse, but the contribution of
glia to the development of addictive behaviors is
unknown. Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a), an in-
flammatory cytokine released by activated glia, can
drive the internalization of synaptic AMPA receptors
on striatal medium spiny neurons. Here we show that
repeated administration of cocaine activates striatal
microglia and induces TNF-a production, which in
turn depresses glutamatergic synaptic strength in
the NAc core and limits the development of behav-
ioral sensitization. Critically, following a period of
abstinence, a weak TLR4 agonist can reactivate mi-
croglia, increase TNF-a production, depress striatal
synaptic strength, and suppress cocaine-induced
sensitization. Thus, cytokine signaling from microglia
can regulate both the induction and expression of
drug-induced behaviors.
INTRODUCTION
Changes in striatal processing, particularly in the NAc, are
thought to be necessary for the maintenance of addictive behav-
iors, and repeated exposure to drugs of abuse leads to predict-
able changes in synaptic strength in the NAc (Lu
¨ scher and Mal-
enka, 2011). Drugs of abuse, such as cocaine, elevate dopamine
levels in the striatum, and ex vivo treatment of striatal medium
spiny neurons (MSNs) with D1 dopamine receptor agonists or
with cocaine increases the phosphorylation and insertion of
AMPA receptors (Chao et al., 2002; Mangiavacchi and Wolf,
2004; Snyder et al., 2000). However, repeated cocaine treatment
in vivo (5 days of noncontingent administration) results in an
initial decrease in the AMPA/NMDA ratio on MSNs in the NAc,
as measured 24 hr after the last cocaine injection (Kourrich
et al., 2007; Mameli et al., 2009). A period of abstinence results
in a gradual elevation of AMPA/NMDA ratios and AMPAR surface
expression (Boudreau and Wolf, 2005; Schumann and Yaka,
2009), although a challenge dose of cocaine will result in lowered
ratios and surface receptor content (Boudreau et al., 2007; Kour-
rich et al., 2007; Thomas et al., 2001). Self-administration of
cocaine also causes similar changes in the NAc, with cocaine
exposure causing a loss of AMPA receptors and depressing syn-
aptic strength on MSNs and extended abstinence resulting in
synaptic strengthening and accumulation of surface AMPA re-
ceptors (Conrad et al., 2008; Ortinski et al., 2012; Schramm-
Sapyta et al., 2006). This bidirectional plasticity suggests that
other factors, in addition to dopamine, contribute to the synaptic
changes induced by drug exposure.
Recently, we have shown that TNF-a drives internalization of
AMPARs on MSNs, reducing corticostriatal synaptic strength,
and reduces the aberrant changes in striatal circuit function
induced by chronic blockade of D2 dopamine receptors (Lewitus
et al., 2014). Glia are the main source of TNF-a in the CNS, and
both microglia (Sekine et al., 2008) and astrocytes (Bowers and
Kalivas, 2003) are activated by psychostimulants. Further, glia
have been suggested to regulate drug-induced behavior (Mi-
guel-Hidalgo, 2009). Thus, glia through the release of TNF-a
could have a mitigating effect on the circuit changes induced
by cocaine. Here we demonstrate that striatal microglia are acti-
vated by cocaine, and moderate the synaptic and behavioral
changes induced by the repeated administration of cocaine.
RESULTS
To determine the effect of in vivo cocaine exposure on TNF-a
levels in the NAc, we measured TNF-a mRNA and protein levels
in mice after i.p. injections of saline or cocaine. A single injection
of cocaine had no effect on TNF-a levels (measured 24 hr post-
injection), but 5 days of daily cocaine treatment (measured 24 hr
after the final injection) increased both TNF-a mRNA and protein,
compared to saline injected controls (Figures 1A–1D). TNF-a
was no longer elevated following 10 days of abstinence from
cocaine. To understand the impact of TNF-a on synaptic func-
tion in the NAc, we measured AMPA/NMDA ratios on MSNs in
the NAc core. Alteration in NAc core AMPA receptors is involved
in the expression of behavioral sensitization to psychostimulants
(Kalivas, 2009).
We have previously shown that TNF-a drives internalization of
AMPARs on MSNs in the dorsal striatum (Lewitus et al., 2014). As
repeated cocaine administration primarily affects direct-pathway

 MSNs, we tested specific subpopulations of MSNs in the NAc
core for their response to TNF-a. Acute NAc slices were incu-
bated with TNF-a and whole-cell recording made from Drd1a-
td Tomato (D1) positive and negative (D2) MSNs. A low dose of
TNF-a (10 ng/ml) had no significant effect on either cell type.
However, 100 ng/ml TNF-a significantly reduced the AMPA/
NMDA ratio on D1-MSNs, with a nonsignificant reduction in ratios
on D2-MSNs (Figure 1E). These results suggest that D1-MSNs
are more sensitive to TNF-a than D2-MSNs, although D2-MSNs
may respond to a lesser degree.
Repeated noncontingent administration of cocaine results
in lower AMPA/NMDA ratios of excitatory inputs onto the NAc
specifically on D1-MSNs (Kim et al., 2011; Pascoli et al., 2012).
To test whether this decrease in AMPA/NMDA ratios is due to
increased TNF-a expression, we evaluated AMPA/NMDA ratios
in the NAc core after cocaine or saline administration in WT and
TNF-a�/� mice. As expected for WT mice, a single injection
of cocaine did not significantly reduce AMPA/NMDA ratios on
D1-MSNs as measured 1 day later, but five daily cocaine
injections did (Figure 1F). Strikingly, in TNF-a�/� mice, a single
injection of cocaine significantly increased AMPA/NMDA ratios,
which remained elevated after 5 days of cocaine treatment (Fig-
ure 1F). No significant differences were observed in D2-MSNs for
either genotype (see Figure S1A available online). These results
suggest that the reduction in AMPA/NMDA ratios in D1-MSNs
after repeated cocaine is due to increased TNF-a in the NAc,
and that cocaine itself increases synaptic strength. This is
consistent with the exocytosis of AMPARs observed with direct
stimulation of D1Rs on MSNs (Mangiavacchi and Wolf, 2004).
Moreover, this result suggests that, following cocaine treatment,
D1-MSNs are more responsive to lower endogenous levels
of TNF-a, perhaps because newly inserted AMPARs are more
labile, as has been seen at potentiated synapses in the amyg-
dala (Clem and Huganir, 2010). To test the hypothesis that
potentiated D1-MSNs are more sensitive to TNF-a, we treated
TNF-a �/� mice with a single injection of cocaine and evaluated
the effect of a low level of TNF-a (10 ng/ml) on AMPA/NMDA
ratios. Although this level of TNF-a had no significant effect
on MSNs from WT untreated animals (Figure 1E), it significantly
reduced AMPA/NMDA ratios on D1-MSNs from cocaine treated
knockout animals (Figure 1G). This treatment had no effect on
D2-MSNs (Figure S1B). To test whether cocaine-induced
TNF-a signaling occludes further synaptic depression by
TNF-a, we treated WT animals with cocaine for 5 days and
then treated striatal slices ex vivo with TNF-a (100 ng/ml). The
AMPA/NMDA ratio on D1-MSNs (already reduced compared to
saline treated animals; Figure 1E) was not further reduced by
treatment with TNF-a (Figure 1G). This shows that the synaptic
depression induced by repeated cocaine injections occludes
the TNF-a-mediated reduction in AMPA/NMDA ratio. Overall,
these data suggest that repeated cocaine treatment elevates
TNF-a, which suppresses the synaptic changes directly induced
by cocaine in the NAc core.
Depressing synaptic strength in the NAc can reduce behav-
ioral sensitization to cocaine (Pascoli et al., 2012). Behavioral
sensitization is a simple model of drug-induced behavioral
change, which measures the progressive increase in locomotor
response to psychostimulants. TNF-a�/� mice displayed an
increased initial locomotor response to cocaine and increased
sensitization, compared to WT mice (Figure 1H). This is similar
to what has been observed with methamphetamine sensitization
in TNF-a�/� mice (Nakajima et al., 2004). To exclude compensa-
tory mechanisms resulting from the absence of TNF-a during
development, we pharmacologically blocked the soluble form
of TNF-a in WT mice using XENP1595 (a dominant-negative
variant of TNF-a [DN-TNF]). WT mice were administered DN-
TNF either during the 5 days of conditioning (to block TNF-a
signaling during acquisition) or during the abstinence period
starting immediately after the last cocaine injection (to test the
role of TNF-a in the maintenance of the behavior). Blocking
TNF-a signaling during acquisition was sufficient to increase
sensitization as well as maintain the elevated response on the
challenge day, while blocking TNF-a signaling during the
10 day period of abstinence had no effect on the response to
the challenge dose (Figure 1I). These results suggest that
TNF-a is active during acquisition but not during drug absti-
nence,
consistent
with
the
increased
TNF-a
expression
observed during that period (Figures 1C and 1D). Further, the
increased sensitivity observed in TNF-a�/� mice on the first
day of cocaine is not due to an acute loss of TNF-a signaling
and is likely to be unrelated to the increase in sensitization.
In other brain regions, TNF-a that regulates synaptic function
is produced by glia (Stellwagen and Malenka, 2006). To assess
the source of TNF-a regulating sensitization, we utilized a
Cre-loxP system to selectively delete TNF-a from microglia
(CX3CR1-Cre; Figure S2A) and astrocytes (GFAP-Cre; Fig-
ure S2B). Mice that lack microglial TNF-a showed significantly
higher sensitization to cocaine from the second cocaine injection
that was maintained through the period of abstinence (Figure 2A).
Conversely, mice that lack astrocytic TNF-a did not display a
significant change in sensitization compared with littermate
controls (Figure 2B). These results suggest that microglia are
important for the adaptive TNF-a response to repeated cocaine
administration. To verify this, we isolated microglia from the
striatum of cocaine and saline treated animals by magnetic
bead sorting (Figure S2C) and compared TNF-a mRNA in the

further decrease AMPA/NMDA ratios from WT mice previously exposed to five daily cocaine injections.

 microglial and nonmicroglial fractions. Microglia contained the
vast majority of TNF-a mRNA, showing over a 20-fold enrich-
ment compared with the other striatal cell types (Figure 2C).
Further, the TNF-a mRNA was increased by cocaine treatment
specifically in microglia cells (Figure 2D) and not in other cell
types (Figure S2D).
Resting microglia continuously survey the healthy brain and
respond to a variety of activation signals by undergoing progres-
sive morphological and functional changes (Kettenmann et al.,
2011). Using Iba1, we labeled microglia in adult mice 24 hr after
a single cocaine injection, 24 hr after 5 days of daily cocaine
injections, or after 10 days of drug abstinence. Although the
number of microglia in the NAc did not change at any time point
(Figure S2E), Iba1 intensity was increased in microglia by 5 days
of cocaine, and after a period of abstinence (Figures 2E and 2F).
Microglia cell body size was increased by 5 days of cocaine (Fig-
ure 2G), accompanied by a decrease in process length (Figures
2H and 2I). These changes in microglia morphology are consis-
tent with an activated phenotype. In contrast, we did not observe
any activation of astrocytes, as judged by the area or intensity of
GFAP expression (Figures S2F and S2G). These data strongly
suggest that microglia are the source of the cocaine-induced up-
regulation of TNF-a production in the striatum observed during
sensitization.
Cocaine could activate microglia directly by binding the sigma
receptor (Navarro et al., 2010) or the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)
(Northcutt et al., 2015), or indirectly through the elevation of
dopamine. To test this, we treated microglia cultures with dopa-
mine or cocaine for 3 hr. Treatment of microglia with 0.1 mM
dopamine, but not 1 mM cocaine, significantly increased TNF-a
mRNA (Figures 3A and 3B). This concentration of dopamine is
reflective of the concentration found in the NAc in vivo following
cocaine administration in rats (Hooks et al., 1992). The same
treatment applied to cultured astrocytes had no effect on
TNF-a mRNA (Figure S3A). Multiple dopamine receptors are
expressed on microglia (Kettenmann et al., 2011). Stimulating
microglia with the D2-like agonist quinpirole increased TNF-a
mRNA, while the D1 agonist SKF-38393 and specific D3 agonist
pramipexole had no effect (Figure 3C). This suggests that
dopamine increases TNF-a production in microglia through D2
receptors. Microglia transcriptional profiles change substantially
during both development and the culturing process (Butovsky
et al., 2014). We therefore cultured microglia from adult animals,
in a manner that preserves an in vivo transcriptional profile (Bu-
tovsky et al., 2014). We saw a similar response to dopamine and
lack of response to cocaine (Figures S3B and S3C). To directly
test the response of microglia in vivo, we treated mice with quin-
pirole (0.5 mg/kg, i.p.; 24 and 1 hr prior to harvest) and isolated

 microglia. Quinpirole treatment increased the TNF-a mRNA in
striatal microglia cells (Figure 3D), but not in other striatal cell
types (Figure S3D), nor in cortical microglia (Figure S3E), indi-
cating that D2-agonism specifically increases microglial TNF-a
in the striatum in vivo. Coadministrating cocaine with the D2
antagonist L741,626 for 5 days reduced the cocaine-induced
increase in microglial TNF-a production (Figure 3E). Finally,
to verify that D2-like receptor activation was required for the
TNF-a-dependent decrease in AMPA/NMDA ratio observed on
D1-MSNs, we treated animals for 5 days with cocaine and the
D2 antagonist. Blocking D2 receptors (and thus preventing the
activation of microglia) resulted in a large cocaine-induced in-
crease in AMPA/NMDA ratio on D1-MSNs, similar to TNF-a�/�
animals (Figure 3F). Overall, this suggests that cocaine elevates
dopamine levels, which act on D1 receptors on direct pathway
MSNs to increase synaptic strength; simultaneously activates
microglia through D2 receptors; and temporarily increases
TNF-a production.
Our data suggest that the activation of microglia limits the
cocaine-induced changes to NAc circuitry, but this activation oc-
curs only during a narrow window following cocaine exposure.
Because depotentiation of MSNs reduces cocaine-induced
behavioral sensitization (Pascoli et al., 2012), we tested if reacti-
vation of microglia to increase TNF-a could depress NAc synap-
ses and suppress sensitization. To do this, we utilized mono-
phosphoryl lipid A (MPLA), a detoxified variant of LPS (Casella
and Mitchell, 2008). MPLA is a weak TLR4 agonist that does
not induce extensive neuroinflammation or sickness behavior
(Michaud et al., 2013). We first verified that MPLA activates
microglia in the NAc, by injecting 10 mg MPLA IP after 10 days
of abstinence from cocaine. MPLA treatment significantly
increased Iba1 intensity within 4 hr compared to saline treated
controls (Figure 4A) and was associated with an increase in stria-
tal TNF-a expression, at both 4 and 24 hr after injection (Fig-
ure 4B). We next tested if MPLA would depress synaptic strength
in the NAc core. After 10 days of abstinence from cocaine, mice
were injected with MPLA and evaluated 24 hr later for AMPA/
NMDA ratios on D1-MSNs. MPLA treatment significantly
reduced AMPA/NMDA ratio in D1-MSNs compared to saline-
treated controls (Figure 4C). Because artificially reducing synap-
tic strength in the NAc can reduce behavioral sensitization (Pas-
coli et al., 2012), these data suggest that MPLA might suppress
drug-induced behaviors.
We first established that MPLA does not alter basal locomo-
tion (Figure S4A). Further, MPLA (10 mg; 24 hr prior to testing)
did not decrease the locomotor response to an initial dose
of cocaine, as tested in saline-treated animals given an initial
dose of cocaine at the challenge time point (Figure 4D). We
then tested sensitized mice by injecting 10 mg or 50 mg MPLA
or saline, 24 hr prior to the challenge dose of cocaine.
Mice treated with MPLA had significantly reduced locomotor
response to the cocaine challenge in a dose-dependent manner
(Figure 4E). This suggests that MPLA reduces sensitization,
rather than the locomotor response to cocaine. The effects of
MPLA also did not appear to be due to an increase in sensitivity
to cocaine, as we observed no increase in stereotypic behaviors
in MPLA treated mice (Figures S4B–S4D). Moreover, MPLA had
no effect on sensitization in TNF-a�/� mice (Figure 4F), which
suggests that MPLA acts through an elevation of TNF-a
and not other cytokines. However, this effect is temporary, as
MPLA had little impact on sensitization when tested 4 days after
injection (Figure S4E). These observations suggest that even af-
ter a prolonged period of abstinence from cocaine, increasing
TNF-a can be effective in reducing the behavioral response to
cocaine, although it does not revert the system to the presensi-
tized state.
DISCUSSION
Chronic cocaine administration produces long-erm neuroadap-
tions of glutamatergic signaling in the NAc that contribute to
addiction-related changes in drug sensitivity and craving. Here
we show that microglia in the NAc are transiently activated
following cocaine administration, and act to downregulate
AMPARs on MSNs through TNF-a signaling. Importantly, this
limits the development of behavioral sensitization. Following
a period of abstinence, MPLA can reactivate microglia and
decrease both synaptic strength in the NAc and locomotor
sensitization to cocaine. Our results suggest that microglia
have an adaptive role in the response to cocaine and that their
modulation could be an effective avenue of treatment. Alter-
ations in the NAc core may be particularly important for the
expression of locomotor sensitization (Kalivas, 2009). Infusion
of AMPA into the NAc core enhances locomotion in animals
that were exposed to cocaine 2–3 weeks earlier (Bell and Kali-
vas, 1996), while AMPAR antagonists administered into the
NAc core prevent the expression of sensitization (Bell et al.,
2000; Pierce et al., 1996). The increase in NAc synaptic strength
has been hypothesized to correlate with the development of
craving (Conrad et al., 2008), and reducing synaptic strength
reduces cue-induced self-administration (Wisor et al., 2011).
This suggests that increasing TNF-a with mild TLR4 activation
may help blunt craving or incentive sensitization.
Further, our results explain a perplexing feature of chronic
cocaine administration—that synaptic strength on D1-MSNs
decreases initially and then slowly increases during withdrawal.
While the formation and subsequent unsilencing of silent synap-
ses likely contribute (Huang et al., 2009) to the changes in AMPA/
NMDA ratios, our results suggest an additional mechanism
is involved. Our data support the idea that dopamine does, as
predicted by in vitro results, increase AMPA/NMDA ratios
while simultaneously activating microglia to release TNF-a. This
TNF-a release causes the decreased AMPA/NMDA ratios
observed following repeated administration of cocaine. This sup-
pression is temporary, as microglia slowly deactivate during
abstinence from cocaine, revealing the underlying dopamine-
induced potentiation. A challenge dose would reactivate the
microglia, increase TNF-a release, and again suppress AMPA/
NMDA ratios as observed (Boudreau et al., 2007; Thomas et al.,
2001). Taken together, our data suggest that TNF-a has an adap-
tive role in regulating glutamatergic transmission in the NAc when
circuit homeostasis is perturbed, akin to the role of TNF-a in ho-
meostatic synaptic plasticity (Stellwagen and Malenka, 2006).
Moreover, our data suggest that microglia are adaptive regu-
lators of striatal function. This is to suggest not that astrocytes
do not regulate striatal function, including the response to drugs,
488
Neuron 90, 483–491, May 4, 2016
 but merely that astrocytes do not supply the TNF-a that opposes
the circuit and behavioral changes induced by cocaine. CX3CR1
is expressed in other cell types (including macrophages and
a small number of neurons), and a TLR4 agonist like MPLA
will act on astrocytes and other cell types. Therefore we cannot
exclude the contribution of other cell types to the TNF-a
response, but it is difficult to argue that microglia are not the ma-
jor source of the response. Microglia express a variety of neuro-
transmitters, neuropeptides, and immune receptors and have
the capacity to rapidly respond to physiological changes in the
brain (Kettenmann et al., 2011). Our results support the idea
that moderate microglia activation has a role in a homeostatic-
type response to significant deviations from the basal state (Kier-
dorf and Prinz, 2013) and has a similar beneficial response in re-
establishing homeostasis following stress (Kreisel et al., 2014).
Hence, augmenting the microglial response, through TLR4 or
other means, might be a useful approach to treat addiction, pro-
vided it only moderately activates the microglia. MPLA, a weak
TLR4 agonist, has been shown to significantly improve cognitive
function in a mouse model of neurodegeneration (Michaud et al.,
2013). We found that MPLA can acutely reduce behavioral sensi-

bar, 20 mm. Semiquantification of immunoreactivity reveals that Iba1 intensity was significantly increased 24 hr after a single MPLA injection.
(B) MPLA (10 mg) significantly increases TNF-a mRNA in the ventral striatum at 4 hr and 24 hr.
(C) Representative traces and AMPA/NMDA ratios from D1-MSNs in the NAc core 24 hr after MPLA (10 mg) or saline injection in mice after 10 days’ withdrawal.
(D) MPLA does not reduce the initial locomotor response to cocaine. Mice were given seven daily saline injections, then after 9 days of abstinence given an
injection of saline or MPLA (10 mg), followed the next day by a challenge dose of cocaine. MPLA did not alter the response to the challenge dose. This response
was lower than the sensitized response in control animals given cocaine during training (n = 8 sal/sal, 7 sal/MPLA, 6 coc/sal).
(E) MPLA did reduce the sensitized response to cocaine. After withdrawal, WT mice were injected with MPLA (10 mg or 50 mg) or saline and tested 24 hr later with a
challenge dose of cocaine (n = 20 for control, 12 for 10 mg MPLA, and 10 for 50 mg MPLA).
(F) MPLA treatment had no effect on sensitization in TNF-a�/� mice, as MPLA (10 mg) did not reduce the response to a challenge dose of cocaine in TNF-a�/� mice
(n = 10 saline, 11 MPLA). Results are expressed as mean ± SEM. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001.
