ABSTRACT  
Background & Aims: Probiotics can reduce symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), but little 
is known about their effects on psychiatric comorbidities. We performed a prospective study to 
evaluate the effects of Bifidobacterium longum NCC3001 (BL) on anxiety and depression in 
patients with IBS. 
Methods: We performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 44 adults with 
IBS and diarrhea or a mixed-stool pattern (based on Rome III criteria) and mild to moderate anxiety 
and/or depression (based on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale) at McMaster University in 
Canada, from March 2011 to May 2014. At the screening visit, clinical history and symptoms were 
assessed and blood samples were collected. Patients were then randomly assigned to groups and 
given daily BL (n=22) or placebo (n=22) for 6 weeks. At week 0, 6 and 10, we determined patients’ 
levels of anxiety and depression, IBS symptoms, quality of life, and somatization using validated 
questionnaires. At week 0 and 6, stool, urine and blood samples were collected, and functional 
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) test was performed. We assessed brain activation patterns, 
fecal microbiota, urine metabolome profiles, serum markers of inflammation, neurotransmitters and 
neurotrophin levels. 
Results: At week 6, 14/22 patients in the BL group had reduction in depression scores of 2 points or 
more on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale, vs 7/22 patients in the placebo group (P=.04). 
BL had no significant effect on anxiety or IBS symptoms. Patients in the BL group had a mean 
increase in quality of life score compared with the placebo group. The fMRI analysis showed that 
BL reduced responses to negative emotional stimuli in multiple brain areas, including amygdala and 
fronto–limbic regions, compared with placebo. The groups had similar fecal microbiota profiles, 
serum markers of inflammation, and levels of neurotrophins and neurotransmitters, but the BL

group had reduced urine levels of methylamines and aromatic amino acids metabolites. At week 10, 
depression scores were reduced in patients given BL vs placebo.  
Conclusion: In a placebo-controlled trial, we found that the probiotic BL reduces depression but not 
anxiety scores and increases quality of life in patients with IBS. These improvements were 
associated with changes in brain activation patterns that indicate that this probiotic reduces limbic 
reactivity. ClinicalTrials.gov no. NCT01276626.

BACKGROUND 
Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), characterized by abdominal pain and altered bowel habits, affects 
11% of the world-wide population1, has a significant socioeconomic impact2 and its current 
treatments have limited efficacy1. Its pathophysiology is incompletely understood but is considered 
to be a disorder of gut-brain interaction3 and is frequently accompanied by psychiatric disorders1,4.  
Accumulating evidence suggests that commensal bacteria play a role in IBS, as multiple studies 
have demonstrated an abnormal composition or metabolic activity of gut microbiota in patients with 
IBS5. Dysbiosis, triggered by acute bacterial gastroenteritis, antibiotics or dietary factors, which are 
known to affect the composition of microbiota, may drive not only the gastrointestinal component 
of IBS but also contribute to its psychiatric comorbidity6. Furthermore, specific probiotic bacteria 
have been shown to improve gastrointestinal symptoms in IBS7.  
We have previously demonstrated that administration of B. longum NCC3001 subspecies longum 
strain (BL) normalized anxiety-like behavior and hippocampal Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor 
(BDNF) levels in mice with low-grade gut inflammation, through vagal dependent pathways8,9. 
Based on these results, we hypothesized that BL will improve psychiatric comorbidity in patients 
with chronic bowel disorders and thus we performed a pilot study in IBS patients.  As anxiety and 
depression are rather difficult to distinguish in animal models, they frequently co-exist in patients 
and altered central BDNF levels were reported in both conditions, we chose as our primary 
objective to evaluate the impact of BL on co-morbid anxiety and depression. The secondary 
objectives were then to assess the effect of BL on IBS symptoms and quality of life, and to explore 
changes in brain activation patterns, circulating inflammatory markers, neurotransmitters, 
neurotrophins, gut microbiota profile and urine metabolites as a measure of host-microbial

metabolic interactions. Considering the large heterogeneity of IBS we decided to restrict our study 
to IBS patients with diarrhea or mixed stool pattern, as they apper to share similar sensory neuro-
imune interaction and are more likely to present with low-grade gut inflammation and similar 
microbiota compared with IBS patients with constipation10,5. 
Although several clinical studies investigated effects of probiotic bacteria on behavior and brain 
function11-12, mostly in healthy individuals, our study is the first one to show that probiotics can 
improve depression scores as well as alter brain activity patterns in IBS patients with comorbid 
depression and anxiety.

METHODS 
Study oversight 
 
We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single center pilot study from 
March 2011 to May 2014. The study was approved by the Hamilton Health Sciences and St. 
Joseph’s Health Care Research Ethics Boards, all participants signed the informed consent. The 
study was registered in clinicaltrials.gov under NCT01276626. All authors had access to the study 
data and reviewed and approved the final manuscript. 
Participants 
We recruited adult patients with a diagnosis of IBS with diarrhea or mixed-stool pattern (Rome III 
criteria)13, and mild to moderate anxiety and/or depression scores based on the Hospital Anxiety 
and Depression (HAD) scale14 (HAD-A or HAD-D score 8-14). Patients with a history of organic 
diseases, immune deficiency, major abdominal surgery, a psychiatric condition other than anxiety 
or depression, use of immunosuppressants, glucocorticosteroids, opioids, antidepressants or 
anxiolytics in regular doses, alcohol or illicit drug consumption, were excluded. Loperamide and 
laxatives were allowed as rescue medications. Other probiotics in any form were forbidden during 
the 1-month run-in period and the trial. Antibiotics were forbidden during the 3 months prior to the 
run-in period and the trial.  
Design of the study 
 
The study involved four hospital visits (Supplementary figure 1). At the screening visit ( -4 weeks), 
clinical history and symptoms were assessed and physical exam and complete bloodwork 
performed. At the baseline visit (week 0), the inclusion and exclusion criteria and symptoms were 
re-assessed, stool, urine and blood samples were collected, and an fMRI study performed.

The patients were then randomised to receive 42 sachets of either spray dried BL (1.0E+10 CFU 
/1gram powder with maltodextrin) or placebo containing 1 gram of maltodextrin. Treatment 
products were indistinguishable in terms of package, color, taste and consistency.  Patients were 
instructed to dissolve the content of the sachet in 100-200 ml of lactose-free milk, soy milk or rice 
milk, preheated to 20° Celsius. Patients were asked not to change their eating habits or fibre intake. 
Participants recorded the treatment intake, the empty sachets were used to assess the compliance at 
the next visit (week 6), where their symptoms were assessed, blood, urine and stool samples 
collected and fMRI test performed. Finally, patients’ symptoms were re-assessed  at a follow-up 
visit (week 10). 
In addition to the regular hospital visits, HAD scores were also assessed at 3 weeks of treatment 
following request of Health Canada. HAD questionnaires were provided to patients at Visit 1 and 
then mailed or e-mailed to the investigators. 
Study endpoints 
 
The primary endpoint was a reduction in anxiety and/or depression scores of ≥2 points on HAD 
scale13 at 6 weeks. This was based on the previously established mean clinically important 
difference for the anxiety and depression score on the HAD scale of 1.3 and 1.4, respectively14. 
Secondary endpoints included improvement in anxiety and depression scores (HAD, continuous 
data), anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, STAI), IBS global adequate relief, IBS symptoms, 
somatization, quality of life, changes in brain activation patterns (functional Magnetic Resonance 
Imaging, fMRI), serum inflammatory markers, neurotransmitters and BDNF, and urine 
metabonomic and stool microbiota profiles.

Randomization 
 
The randomization sequence was performed using a computer program (Proc Plan, SAS, V. 9.1). A 
block randomization was stratified by gender and IBS status (diarrhea or mixed stool pattern). The 
codes were kept in sealed opaque envelopes allocated to patients according to strata. Each pack was 
assigned a number according to the randomization sequence. On recruitment, the patients were 
assigned into one of four strata and given the next consecutive randomization number available for 
that stratum. Treatment allocation was concealed from participants and study staff. 
 
Treatment products indistinguishable in terms of package, color, taste and consistency, were 
identified with two non-speaking codes per arm. Their identity was blind to subjects, investigators 
and support staff, known only by the manufacturer, Nestlé Product Technology Centre Konolfingen 
Switzerland. 
Study Measurements  
Anxiety and depression were assessed by the HAD score. As an additional measure of anxiety we 
used the STAI15, which assesses both state and trait anxiety. IBS symptoms and signs were assessed 
by the Birmingham IBS score16 and Bristol stool scale17. To evaluate an overall improvement of 
IBS symptoms, patients were asked a validated question: “Over the past week have you had 
adequate relief of your IBS symptoms?” with a dichotomous option for responses18. Health-related 
quality of life (QoL) was measured by the SF-3619 and somatization by the PHQ-15 
questionnaires20. 
Brain activity was assessed by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) using General 
Electric 3-Tesla Discovery MR 750, whole body short bore scanner with 32 parallel receiver 
channels (General Electric, Milwaukee, WI). The 1-hour protocol included a seven minute T1 
weighted structural scan, followed by four repetitions of a fearful face backward masking

paradigm21 (Supplementary figure 2) during four fMRI Blood Oxygen Level Dependent scans22 
(BOLD EPI; TR/TE=2800/35 ms, flip angle=90º, 3 mm thick slices, no gap, field of view=24 cm, 
matrix=64x64). Pre-processing of MRI data was completed using Brain Voyager QX Version 2.8.2, 
32-bit (Brain Innovation, Maastricht, Netherlands).  Anatomic and functional data were inspected 
and scans with artefacts or fMRI scans with movement greater than 5 mm in any of 6 planes were 
excluded from analysis. Anatomical scans were transformed into standard sagittal orientation, and 
underwent spatial normalization into standard Talaraich space. Slice scan time correction and 3D 
motion correction were carried out on the fMRI data and spatial smoothing applied using a 
Gaussian filter (FWHM=6 mm). The amygdala was selected as region of interest (ROI), initially 
derived from the WFUPick Atlas and refined according to anatomic landmarks on the full group 
average transformed T1 image.   
Blood and urine samples were collected after an overnight fast. After processing, the samples were 
stored at -80 C until assessment. Samples for BDNF were collected using the PAXgene Blood RNA 
(PreAnalytiX, Qiagen BD, Toronto, Canada). Serum cytokines and CRP levels were assessed by 
Human ProInflammatory 7-Plex Ultra-Sensitive Kit (MSD, Gaithersburg, MD) and CRP Abbott 
Architect kit (Abbott Laboratories, IL), respectively. BDNF protein level was assessed by Human 
BDNF DuoSet ELISA kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Plasma neurotransmitters were 
quantified using following kits: 5-HT: IBL, Hamburg, Germany; Substance P: Abcam, Cambridge, 
UK; CGRP: Cloud-Clone Corp, Houston, TX. 
  
Urine metabolites were assessed by 1H NMR profiling using a Bruker Avance II 600 MHz 
spectrometer equipped with a 1.7 mm probe at 300 K (Bruker Biospin, Rheinstetten, Germany), 
using a standard pulse sequence with water suppression, and processed using TOPSPIN (version 
2.1, Bruker, Germany) software package. The metabolite identification was achieved using in house 
database and 2D 1H NMR spectroscopy experiments. Chemometric analysis was performed using

the software package SIMCA-P+ (version 14.0, Umetrics AB, Umeå, Sweden) and in-house 
developed MATLAB routines. Orthogonal Projection to Latent Structures (OPLS) and OPLS 
discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) were employed for exploring the variance in the metabonomics 
data that may explain statistical differences between groups of samples. The classification accuracy 
of the OPLS-DA was established from the predicted samples in the 7-fold cross-validation cycle. 
To highlight the weight of individual variables in the model, Variable Importance in Projection 
(VIP) was used, with a value above 1 used as a threshold by convention.  For additional details, see 
Supplementary Methods. 
   
Microbiota analysis was performed using Illumina sequencing of the V3 region of 16S rRNA gene 
as described previously23, for details see Supplementary Methods. Bacterial strain-specific PCR24 
was used on fecal DNA extracts to detect the presence of BL at the end of the treatment period. 
 
Statistical analysis 
 
Statistical analyses were performed using IBM-SPSS (IBM-SPSS Statistics v20, Chicago, IL). We 
performed post-hoc power calculations based on our previous animal data, which showed strong 
therapeutic potential of this probiotic8-9.  We estimated that a sample size of 19 in each group would 
have 80% power using a two-group χ2 test with 0.05 two-sided significance level assuming 30% 
have an improvement in depression and/or anxiety in the placebo group and 75% in the B. longum 
group.  
Data from all randomized subjects were analyzed according to intention to treat (ITT) principles for 
the primary outcome. To deal with missing data, we used the extreme case analysis assuming that 
all missing subjects had no improvement in symptoms. Per protocol evaluation (PP) excluded data 
from subjects who did not complete the trial due to consumption of proscribed medication or non-

compliance with the study protocol, and was used for the primary and secondary outcomes. For 
testing the effects on the two primary endpoints, Pearson Chi-Squared and Mann-Whitney U test 
were used as appropriate. In addition, the HAD scores were analyzed at baseline, week 3, 6 and 10 
post-treatment using ANOVA repeated measures. ANCOVA was used to adjust for baselines 
differences in HAD depression scores. A two-sided test was used and p<0.05 was considered 
statistically significant. 
fMRI data were analyzed by the general linear model (GLM) with experimental events convolved 
with the hemodynamic response function. Activation maps were constructed identifying clusters of 
activity associated with peak differences in activation for experimental conditions (fear, happy, 
fixation)21. BOLD signal contrasts were submitted to random‐effect analyses and corrected for 
multiple comparisons using the False Discovery Rate approach25. Second-level random effects-
GLM analyses assessed differences in-group responses to the fearful faces before and after 
treatment.  A priori predictions that BL will modulate activation in the amygdala were tested with 
region of interest (ROI) analysis. A standard Brodmann map (WFU Pic Atlas)26 was co-registered 
to the average composite anatomic data set and used to prescribe Regions of Interest (ROI) in the 
right and left amygdala. An event related deconvolution model for each participant was used to 
examine % BOLD signal change at each and every voxel within the ROI. Contrasts were corrected 
for multiple-comparisons at  the cluster level using the false discovery rate methodology 
(FDR(q)<.05)25 and the average statistical value for ROI reported.  
For metabonomic analaysis, representative signals of the identified metabolites were integrated and 
tested using non-parametric Mann Whitney test.

RESULTS 
Study patients  
Sixty patients were enrolled in the study (Figure 1). Sixteen patients failed the screening due to: 1) 
very mild IBS symptoms (n=2) or low HAD score (n=1); 2) use of antibiotics (n=2); 3) 
unwillingness to follow the protocol (n=7), or 5) loss to follow-up (n=4). Thus, 44 patients were 
randomized (22 in each study arm), from whom 38 completed the study (BL=18, placebo=20). 
During the treatment, six patients dropped out due to use of antibiotics (n=4), or antidepressants 
(n=2). No differences were observed between the groups in baseline characteristics (Table 1),  
except for higher HAD-D scores in the BL group (Table 2).  
Primary outcome: Improvement in depression and/or anxiety scores 
   
At 6 weeks, 14 out of 22 (64%) patients in the BL group had decreased depression scores (HAD-D 
≥2 points) compared with 7 out of 22 (32%) patients given placebo (relative risk (RR) 1.98; 95% 
confidence interval (CI) 1.16-3.38; p=0.04) in the ITT population (Table 3A). This response was 
more prominent in the PP analysis with 78% in the BL group compared with 35% of the placebo 
group having lower depression scores (RR 2.4; 95% CI 1.26-4.58; p=0.016). The improvement in 
HAD-D scores was sustained in both the ITT (RR 2.05; 95% CI 1.07-3.93; p=0.04) and the PP 
analysis (RR 2.14; 95% CI 1.11-4.12; p=0.04) at 10-week follow-up. The results at 6 weeks were 
similar when the analysis was performed in only the subgroup of patients with baseline scores 
indicative of depression (HAD-D ≥8), (RR 3.75; 95% CI 0.6-22.1; p=0.047). No significant 
differences in number of patients with decreased anxiety (HAD-A ≥2 points) were found between 
the groups at 6 or 10-week follow-up. 
A sensitivity analysis performed to explore the relationship between depression scores and 
gastrointestinal symptoms showed that the beneficial effect of BL on depression scores at 6 and 10

weeks was more likely to occur in those patients who reported adequate relief of IBS symptoms 
(Table 3B). 
Secondary outcomes 
HAD scores 
After treatment, there were no significant differences on HAD-D scores when assessed as a 
continuous outcome between the two groups (Table 2), but when adjusting for baseline differences 
a greater improvement was found in the BL group (ANCOVA p=0.049). Anxiety scores assessed as 
a continuous outcome were similar between the two groups (Table 2). 
IBS symptoms  
 
There was no difference in adequate relief of IBS symptoms in the ITT analysis at 6 weeks (RR 1.6,  
95% CI 0.86-2.91; p=0.22) but the PP analysis showed a statistically significant benefit of BL over 
placebo (RR 2.03 95% CI 1.13-3.65; p=0.02).  This beneficial effect was not, however, maintained 
at 10-week follow-up (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.24-2.09; p=0.52). No significant differences were 
observed in the overall Birmingham score or sub scores for constipation, diarrhea or pain at 6 or 10 
weeks (Table 2).  
State and trait anxiety and somatization  
 
No differences in STAI scores were observed between groups at 6-week or 10-week follow-up 
(Table 2). Somatization scores were also similar between groups at 6-week or 10-week follow up 
(Table 2). 
Quality of life  
QoL improved in the physical subdomain in the BL group compared with placebo (p=0.03; 95% CI 
0.01-0.90) (Table 2), with amelioration in general physical health (physical functioning; p=0.04;

95% CI 0.43-0.51) and problems with work or other daily activities (role physical; p=0.01; 95% CI 
0.009-0.013).  
Brain activation patterns by fMRI   
Brain activation patterns differed in response to fearful versus happy faces in all subjects studied 
(Supplementary Figure 3, Supplementary Table 1). Before treatment, there was no difference in 
response to fear stimuli versus fixation between placebo and the BL group, except for greater 
engagement of the visual association and parietal cortices in the latter group (Figure 2A-B). 
However, after treatment, compared with placebo, the BL group showed reduced engagement of the 
amygdala, frontal and temporal cortices, as well as heightened engagement of occipital regions in 
response to the fear stimuli (compared with fixation) (Figure 2B-C, Table 4). Overall, the change in 
engagement of the amygdala correlated with the change in depression scores (r=0.52, p=0.004; 
Figure 2E). Within the BL group, reduced engagement of the amygdala correlated with decreased 
depression scores (r=0.58, p=0.03), but this was not observed in the placebo group (r=0.20, 
p=0.46). In the BL group, reduced engagement of the amygdala was more likely to occur in patients 
with adequate relief of IBS symptoms than in those without it (RR 3.07 95% CI 0.89-10.59; p=0.03), 
but this was not observed in the control group (RR 1.5 95% CI 1.00-2.23; p=0.51; Figure 2E).  
There was no difference when comparing response to fearful versus neutral faces.  
Inflammatory markers, neurotransmitters and BDNF levels 
 
No differences in serum inflammatory markers (CRP, TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL12 
and IL-10/12 ratio) or neurotransmitters (5-HT, substance P and CGRP) were found between the 
groups at 6 weeks (Supplementary table 2).  Similarly, no changes in blood BDNF mRNA or 
BDNF protein levels were identified.

and Observed Species indices) before or after the treatment between the two groups.  Microbiota 
profiles were also similar when assessed by Bray-Curtis Principle Coordinate analysis or Bray-
Curtis Distance comparisons (Supplementary Figure 4). BL was detected at the end of treatment in 
15 out of 18 (80%) patients of the probiotic group. 
Urine metabonomics  
OPLS discriminant analysis was applied using one predictive and two orthogonal components to 
model urine metabolic differences between the two groups (Supplementary Figure 5). The model 
was statistically robust only for post-treatment analysis (R2X=0.17, R2Y=0.84, Q2Y=0.20, where 
R2X: explained variance in the metabonomics data (urine metabolites), R2Y: explained group 
variance (placebo and probiotic) and Q2Y: robustness of the model).  Before treatment, there was 
no difference between the two groups (Q2Y<0). After treatment, however, the BL group showed a 
lower urinary excretion of phenylacetyglutamine (PAG), creatine, 4-cresol sulfate and 
trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) ( Supplementary Figure 5, Table 6). Levels of 4-cresol sulfate 
after treatment correlated with depression scores in the BL group (r=-0.53, p=0.03) but not in the 
control group. No other correlation was found between the metabolites and depression scores or the 
amygdala activity. 
Adverse events 
 
No serious adverse events, with a probable or certain relationship to the study product, were noted 
(Supplementary table 3).

DISCUSSION 
In this randomized, placebo controlled study we found that 6-week administration of 
Bifidobacterium longum NCC3001 (BL) decreased depression but not anxiety scores, which was 
our primary outcome, and decreased responses to fearful stimuli in multiple brain areas involved in 
the processing of emotions, including the amygdala and fronto–limbic regions. Patients given BL 
also reported improvement in overall symptoms of IBS and physical domain of QoL. Despite being 
a pilot study with limited subject numbers, this is the first trial to show that a specific probiotic 
improves depression scores in IBS patients and induces pronounced changes in brain activity in 
regions that have been previously implicated in depression, and that are influenced by anti-
depressant therapy27,28. Indeed, both depression and anxiety disorders have been associated with 
amygdala hyperactivity and converging evidence suggests that one mechanism by which Selective 
Serotonin Re-uptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) exert their beneficial action is by downregulating its 
activity27,28. Our study also validates the use of some murine models8,9 to screen probiotics for their 
potential therapeutic benefit in humans, as BL was shown previously to improve anxiety-like 
behavior and brain chemistry in mice. 
There is growing interest in the role of the intestinal microbiota in health and disease. Gut bacteria 
not only instruct and shape the host immune system, and impact its metabolism, but also affect 
function in the gut and central nervous system29,30. Animal studies have demonstrated that changes 
in microbiota composition31 or administration of specific probiotics, including bifidobacteria, can 
alter behavior and brain chemistry of the host8,9,32. Multiple mechanisms are likely involved in this 
microbiota-brain communication, including immune, neural and metabolic pathways30. We have 
previously extensively investigated the beneficial effect of BL on behavior in murine models and 
shown that this probiotic normalizes inflammation-induced anxiety-like behavior and hippocampal

BDNF levels8,9. The beneficial effect on behavior was mediated through vagal signaling, possibly 
through release of neuroactive metabolites acting on enteric neurons9.  
Despite accumulating evidence of the influence of microbiota on behavior in animal models, data 
from humans are rather limited30. Two studies in healthy volunteers reported no major effects of 
probiotic on anxiety and depression scores33,34. A very recent pilot study in patients with major 
depression showed that depression improved in both the placebo and probiotic groups, although the 
improvement appeared to be greater in the latter35. The only study, which directly linked the gut 
microbiota to brain function, assessed effects of mixture of probiotic bacteria in healthy females. 
Although no change in behavior in that trial was observed, fMRI showed decreased BOLD activity 
in the limbic and sensory brain regions in response to facial expressions, which stimulate emotional 
responses12. We used a similar emotive challenge that is known to induce activation in several brain 
regions, including the amygdala, where the fear response is particularly salient36, and which was 
thus chosen as a predetermined ROI. We found that BL administration decreased activation of the 
amygdala and the fronto–limbic complex compared with placebo, which was paralleled by 
decreased depression scores. The amygdala is not only involved in regulation of fear and anxiety, 
but also in activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA)37 and modulation of the 
visceral sensitivity38. In our study, pain scores appeared to improve more in the BL group compared 
to the placebo group, although the difference was not statistically significant. However, the BL 
group was more likely to report the adequate relief of IBS symptoms and this was associated with 
decreased amygdala activation. Thus changes in pain perception could explain the overall 
improvement of IBS symptom in the BL group but this should be further investigated in future, 
better powered trials.

Multiple studies have demonstrated beneficial effects of different probiotics in patients with IBS, 
and a recent meta-analysis7 has shown that bifidobacteria are more likely to improve 
gastrointestinal symptoms than lactobacilli. Underlying mechanisms may involve improvement of 
low-grade gut inflammation present in a subset of patients with IBS39. Inflammation has also been 
linked to psychiatric disorders as pro-inflammatory cytokines can affect mood by a number of 
mechanisms, including activation of the HPA axis and alteration of the metabolism of 
neurotransmitters40. We found no differences in serum CRP or cytokines levels between placebo 
and patients given BL, indicating that the beneficial effect of this probiotic is not mediated by 
improvement in inflammation, in agreement with the previous study in mice8.   
Our murine study demonstrated that hippocampal BDNF was upregulated by BL8.  Neurotrophin 
BDNF influences survival and differentiation of neurons, formation of functional synapses and 
neuroplasticity41 and is decreased in major depressive disorder42. We found no differences in serum 
BDNF or neurotransmitter levels, including serotonin, in patients given BL compared with patients 
in the placebo group  but this does not rule out the possibility that BDNF or neutransmitters levels 
in specific brain regions were modulated by the probiotic. 
As changes in gut microbiota composition have been linked to altered behavior and brain 
chemistry31, we assessed fecal bacterial profiles before and after the treatment. Analysis of fecal 
16S rRNA gene sequencing suggests that the beneficial effect of BL is independent of major 
alterations in microbioal composition. However, BL altered the urinary metabolic profile suggestive 
of downregulated bacterial degradation of methylamines and aromatic amino acids43, including a 
decrease in host-bacterial co-metabolite 4-cresol sulfate, a by-product of tyrosine fermentation44. 
Interestingly, 4-cresol sulfate is known to inhibit dopamine β-hydroxylase45, which is a constituent 
of the catecholamine biosynthetic pathway involved in mood regulation46. This enzyme converting

dopamine into noradrenaline is expressed in the central and peripheral nervous system as well as in 
chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla47, and its decreased activity has been associated with 
depression46. In our study, levels of 4-cresol sulfate correlated with improved depression scores in 
BL group suggesting that dopamine/noradrenaline pathway may play an important role in the effect 
of this probiotic. In future studies, a targeted metabolomic approach should provide further insight 
into the impact of BL on the bacterial metabolism of aromatic amino acids and the subsequent 
modulation of the host’s catecholamine production. 
Although this is the first randomized trial to show that probiotics decrease depression scores in IBS 
patients there are limitations that are important to emphasize.  We used the HAD scale to identify 
patients with psychiatric comorbidity, which is well validated and widely used in studies 
investigating IBS as a simple tool to screen for comorbid anxiety or depression3. Its psychometric 
properties may be inferior to clinician-administered rating scales for depression and anxiety, but its 
main advantage is that it does not measure somatic symptoms13,48, a strong confounding factor in 
any study of IBS patients. Indeed, there is no superior validated questionnaire that can be used in 
patients with a concurrent medical disorder. However, a confirmatory trial using additional specific 
psychometric tools in a larger cohort of patient is needed to substantiate our current results. A 
weakness of our study was the difference in the baseline depression scores between the two groups 
with lower values in the placebo group. The improvement in depression in the probiotic group 
could relate to regression to the mean or reflect a floor effect. We believe this is unlikely, however, 
as a statistically significant result in favor of BL remained when adjusting for baseline differences 
using, and when performing analysis only in the subgroup of patients with baseline scores 
indicative of depression (HAD-D ≥8). Also, there was a linear decrease in the depression subscale 
of the HAD score in the BL group that did not asymptote with the placebo HAD score

(Supplementary Figure 6). Furthermore, the observed changes in brain activation patterns in the 
areas involved in mood regulation in the BL group support the notion that this probiotic has anti-
depressive properties. We have not shown any effect of BL on individual gut symptoms but our 
study was not adequately powered to detect these changes. Thus, a larger, appropriately powered 
trial with patients with IBS and comorbid depression is needed to verify our data on psychiatric and 
gut symptoms before BL can be recommended in clinical practice. 
In conclusion, B. longum NC3001 has longstanding beneficial effects on mild to moderate comorbid 
depression and it temporarily improves overall symptoms of IBS and QoL. This is associated with 
changes in activity of multiple brain areas involved in emotional processing, but no improvement in 
individual gut symptoms, suggesting that central effects of this probiotic underlies its therapeutic 
effect, possibly through modulation of host catecholamine production.

Figure 2: Brain activation patterns assessed by fMRI  
Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) was used to assess the BOLD response to fearful 
stimuli compared with fixation. Group differences in activation pattern are displayed. At baseline, 
when examining all brain regions (A), there was slightly greater engagement of the visual 
association (A1) and parietal cortices (A2) in B longum (BL) group compared with the placebo 
group, with no difference in predetermined region of interest (ROI), amygdala (B). After treatment 
(at 6 weeks), the BL group displayed lesser engagement of the amygdala, as well as frontal and 
temporal cortices that are involved in anxiety and mood regulation (C, D; in yellow-orange) and 
increased engagement of occipital regions (in blue) compared with the placebo group. At 6 week, 
the amygdala activation correlated with the depression scores in the whole cohort and the BL group 
(E, middle and right panel). Patients with adequate relief of IBS symptoms (blue dots) were more 
likely to have  lesser engagement of the amygdala than the patients without improvement in their 
IBS symptoms (red dots).

Brain activation patterns assessed by fMRI for post-treatment group differences (placebo vs 
treatment; fear vs. fixation) in all brain regions (top) and for ROI- amygdala analyses (bottom). 
All data are corrected for multiple comparisons; FDR(q)<.05. Positive T-values identify regions 
of greater activation in response to fear stimuli for the placebo group compared to BL group.

The backward masking paradigm: The fixation was jittered, followed by the presentation of a 
fearful or happy face for 67 ms, followed by the masking of the stimuli with a neutral face for 83 
ms. Participants had 1800 ms to respond. Four presentations of the paradigm were collected, with 
84 trials per presentation (scan).

Supplementary Figure 3. Group responses to fear stimuli vs. happy or fixation stimuli. 
A. Full group response to fear face stimuli at both time points contrasted with the full group 
response to happy face stimuli. The analysis identified a number of brain regions that showed 
greater engagement in response to the fear stimuli including the amygdala, insula and regions in the 
frontal cortices.  
B. Full group response to fear stimuli contrasted with full group response to fixation stimuli, at both 
time points revealed broad activation including the fusiform gyri, thalamus, striatal regions, parietal 
cortices and hippocampal/amygdala complex.

B: Overview of OPLS-DA coefficient plots resulting for urine NMR data and group discriminant 
analysis (placebo top, probiotics bottom). The OPLS coefficients plots are presented using a back-
scaling transformation and projection to aid biomarker visualization. The direction of the signals in 
the plots relative to zero indicates positive or negative covariance with the group of interest. Each 
variable is plotted with a color code which indicates its discriminating power as calculated from the 
correlation matrix thus highlighting biomarker rich spectral regions.

Supplementary methods: 
Microbiota analysis: 
Microbiota analysis was performed using Illumina sequencing of the V3 region of 16S rRNA gene 
as described previously1. The data were processed by an in-house bioinformatics pipeline that 
incorporates quality filtering, Cutadapt2, PandaSeq3, AbundantOTU4, mothur5 and QIIME6. 
Abundant OTU provide output of clustered sequences in operational taxonomic units (OTUs). 
Taxonomic assignments use the RDP classifier7 with the Greengenes training set8. Analysis 
includes alpha-diversity measures for each sample and estimates of total diversity using QIIME, as 
well as β-diversity measures (weighted and unweighted Unifrac, Bray-Curtis) and other statistical 
analysis using QIIME and the PhyloSeq9 package implemented in R. 
 
Metabonomics analysis: 
1H NMR metabolite profiling approach was applied to urine samples, since this biofluid contains 
useful time-averaged representations of the recent homeostatic metabolic history of the individual 
and also carry indirect information on the gut microbial metabolic activities via the excretion 
patterns of many polar microbial-mammalian co-metabolites10, 11 (Supplementary Figure 5A). 
Forty µL of urine were mixed with 20 µL of deuterated phosphate buffer solution 0.6 M KH2PO4, 
containing 1 mM of sodium 3-(trimethylsilyl)-[2,2,3,3-2H4]-1-propionate (TSP, chemical shift 
reference δH = 0.0 ppm). 60µL of the mixture were transferred into 1.7mm NMR tubes. 1H NMR 
spectra were acquired with a Bruker Avance II 600 MHz spectrometer equipped with a 1.7 mm 
probe at 300 K (Bruker Biospin, Rheinstetten, Germany), using a standard pulse sequence with

water suppression, and processed using TOPSPIN (version 2.1, Bruker, Germany) software 
package. The metabolite identification was achieved using in house database and 2D 1H NMR 
spectroscopy experiments.  
Chemometric analysis was performed using the software package SIMCA-P+ (version 14.0, 
Umetrics AB, Umeå, Sweden) and in-house developed MATLAB routines. Orthogonal Projection 
to Latent Structures (OPLS)12 and OPLS discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) were employed for 
exploring the variance in the metabonomics data that may explain statistical differences between 
groups of samples. The classification accuracy of the OPLS-DA was established from the predicted 
samples in the 7-fold cross-validation cycle. To highlight the weight of individual variables in the 
model, Variable Importance in Projection (VIP) was used, with a value above 1 used as a threshold 
by convention. In addition, influential NMR variables that are correlated to the group separation are 
identified using the variable coefficients according to a previously published methods13. 
Representative signals of the identified metabolites were integrated and tested using non-parametric 
Mann Whitney test.
