SUMMARY
Mesothelioma is a fatal tumor of the pleura and is
strongly associated with asbestos exposure. The
molecular mechanisms underlying the long latency
period of mesothelioma and driving carcinogenesis
are
unknown.
Moreover,
late
diagnosis
means
that mesothelioma research is commonly focused
on end-stage disease. Although disruption of the
CDKN2A (INK4A/ARF) locus has been reported in
end-stage disease, information is lacking on the sta-
tus of this key tumor suppressor gene in pleural
lesions preceding mesothelioma. Manufactured car-
bon nanotubes (CNTs) are similar to asbestos in
terms of their fibrous shape and biopersistent prop-
erties and thus may pose an asbestos-like inhalation
hazard. Here we show that instillation of either long
CNTs or long asbestos fibers into the pleural cavity
of mice induces mesothelioma that exhibits common
key pro-oncogenic molecular events throughout the
latency period of disease progression. Sustained
activation of pro-oncogenic signaling pathways,
increased proliferation, and oxidative DNA damage
form
a
common
molecular
signature
of
long-
CNT- and long-asbestos-fiber-induced pathology.
We show that hypermethylation of p16/Ink4a and
p19/Arf in CNT- and asbestos-induced inflammatory
lesions
precedes
mesothelioma;
this
results
in
silencing of Cdkn2a (Ink4a/Arf) and loss of p16 and
p19 protein, consistent with epigenetic alterations
playing a gatekeeper role in cancer. In end-stage me-
sothelioma, silencing of p16/Ink4a is sustained and
deletion of p19/Arf is detected, recapitulating human
disease. This study addresses the long-standing
question of which early molecular changes drive
carcinogenesis during the long latency period of me-
sothelioma development and shows that CNT and
asbestos pose a similar health hazard.
INTRODUCTION
Malignant mesothelioma is an aggressive, incurable tumor
strongly associated with asbestos exposure and with increasing
incidence reported worldwide. Length-dependent retention of
asbestos fibers in the pleural cavity is crucial for disease devel-
opment, with chronic inflammation playing an important role in
carcinogenesis [1, 2]. The latency period of this disease extends
to 40 years, and molecular events leading to malignant transfor-
mation are poorly understood. Mesothelioma in humans is
considered to be a ‘‘disease of gene loss,’’ rather than being
associated with driver mutations [3]. Genetic analyses identified
several key genetic alterations in end-stage disease, with most
common deletions or mutations in CDKN2A, NF2, and BAP1
genes [4], and suggested that two main pathways, p53/DNA
repair and PI3K-AKT, were associated with mesothelioma pro-
gression [5]. Compromised antioxidant response due to muta-
tion of DNA repair genes may also contribute to oncogenesis
[6]. Epigenetic alterations play a gatekeeper role in cancer as
they are the earliest observable genetic change [7]. DNA hyper-
methylation is commonly associated with tumor suppressor
gene silencing. Transcriptional inactivation of these genes and
the loss of their functions most frequently occur during the early
stages of the carcinogenesis and at the pre-cancerous stages of
tumor [7, 8]. Although disruption of the CDKN2A locus, including
p16/INK4A silencing, has been reported in end-stage disease
[4, 9], the key molecular events that occur during the long latency
period of mesothelioma are unknown. Due to their high aspect
ratio and biopersistent properties, carbon nanotubes (CNTs)
may pose an asbestos-like inhalation hazard [10–12]. Several
thousand tons of CNTs are produced each year, and these
new compounds have many commercial and medical appli-
cations, including their incorporation into sports equipment,

 computers, and building materials. In vivo studies have indicated
that CNTs can cause sustained inflammation and fibrosis of the
pleura [1] and can also induce tumor development; however, this
has only been shown in genetically susceptible or peritoneally
exposed rodent models [12–15]. Data comparing prolonged
pleural exposure of wild-type animals to occupationally relevant
doses of CNTs or asbestos is lacking, and the molecular mech-
anisms underlying fiber-induced carcinogenesis have not been
explored [16].
Here we investigate the effect of instillation of long CNTs and
long asbestos into the pleural cavity of mice, the major site of tu-
mor development in humans. We show that long CNTs and long
asbestos induce mesothelioma with deletion of p19/Arf and
silencing of p16/Ink4a, highlighting that epigenetic alterations
play a gatekeeper role in mesothelioma. Importantly, this study
identifies, for the first time, key molecular events underlying pro-
gression of long-CNT-induced inflammatory lesions to malignant
mesothelioma and addresses the long-standing question of
which molecular changes drive carcinogenesis during the la-
tency period of asbestos-induced mesothelioma.
RESULTS
Common Molecular Signature of Inflammatory Lesions
Induced by Asbestos and CNTs
In three parallel studies, we exposed mice to low, occupationally
relevant doses of CNTs, consecutively reducing the dose and
increasing exposure time: 5 mg/mouse for 1–12 weeks; 2.5 mg
for 1 year; and 1 mg, 0.5 mg, and 0.2 mg for up to 20 months. In
each study, a comparator group of animals was subjected to
25 mg amosite asbestos fiber exposure. Long (pathogenic) and
short (not associated with disease) fiber amosite asbestos
(LFA and SFA, respectively; [17, 18]) and long and short CNTs
(LNTs and SNTs, respectively) were injected into the pleural cav-
ity of mice, the major site of mesothelioma development (Fig-
ure S1 and STAR Methods), and the responses along the pleura
were assessed at time points up to 20 months post-injection.
This approach reflects the localization of fibers in the pleural
space observed after translocation of fibers from the lungs [19].
Direct instillation of long, but not short, asbestos and CNTs
into the pleural cavity of mice resulted in the development and
marked progression of inflammatory lesions along the pleura
(Figure 1A). The cellular profile of the lesions, comprising meso-
thelial cells and stromal cells as assessed by immunostaining,
reflected the transition from acute to chronic inflammation [20]
and was similar for both LFA and LNTs at 1 week, 12 weeks,
and 6 months post-injection (Figures 1B and 2A).
mRNA array analysis (GEO: GSE51636) showed a common
pattern of gene expression changes in both LFA- and LNT-
induced lesions. When analyzed using hierarchical clustering,
the samples from LFA- and LNT-exposed mice clustered
together, whereas vehicle control (VC), SFA, and SNT groups
formed a separate cluster (Figure 1C). The major network identi-
fied was associated with the inflammatory response (Table S1).
To examine which signaling pathways were activated in
CNT-exposed tissues, we determined the status of 64 kinases
in pleurae from fiber-exposed and control animals. Antibody-
based array analysis showed activation of pro-oncogenic
signaling pathways, including Src family kinases, Akt, mTOR,
ERK1/2, and STAT3, that was sustained in the pleurae of animals
exposed to long, but not short, fibers (Figure S3). Acute and sus-
tained kinase activation in both LFA- and LNT-exposed pleurae
was strikingly similar, both in terms of the specific pathways
identified and in their degree of activation (Figure 1D). Impor-
tantly, stimulation of these pathways was also observed in hu-
man mesothelioma tumor tissue from five patients compared
to normal primary mesothelial cells (Figures 1E and 1F). Immuno-
staining of mesothelioma patient tissue demonstrated positive
staining for the mesothelial marker HBME-1 and phosphorylated
mTOR, 4EBP1, and Src in mesothelioma cells, as well as phos-
pho-ERK1/2 in mesothelioma cells and fibroblasts, while phos-
pho-STAT3 was predominant in lymphocytes and fibroblasts
(Figure 1G).
Similar to that observed in mesothelioma patient samples,
specific signaling pathways were activated in different cell types
within LFA- and LNT-induced lesions. Thus, activation of ERK
was restricted to the mesothelial cells overlaying the inflamma-
tory lesions; Src, mTOR, and Akt were stimulated in both meso-
thelial cells and stroma, whereas STAT3 activation was most
apparent in the stroma (Figure S4).
STAT3 expression is known to link inflammation and cancer
[21]; therefore, to dissect the role of Stat3 and related genes,
we isolated mRNA from specific areas of the lesions by laser
microdissection (Figure 2B), thus enabling quantification of
gene expression to be correlated to different cell types (meso-
thelial cells and stroma). Stat3 was upregulated (>3-fold) in
both the mesothelial layer and stroma isolated from animals
exposed to either LFA or LNTs, and its expression correlated

 with mRNA levels of IL-6, a well-characterized inducer of STAT3
in the IL-6/JAK2/STAT3 cascade [22, 23]. Signaling via the PI3K/
mTOR axis is also important in asbestos-induced carcinogen-
esis [24]; consistent with this, the Pik3cg gene was upregulated
in both LFA- and LNT-treated mice (Figure 2B).
Progression of Fiber-Induced Lesions Is Characterized
by Increased Proliferation and Oxidative DNA Damage
At 6 months post-injection, both LFA- and LNT-induced lesions
expanded to become contiguous with the surface of the chest

 fibrous stroma, active fibroblasts, and scattered mononuclear
cells. Again, a distinct pattern of signaling pathway activation
was common to both LFA- and LNT-induced lesions (Fig-
ure 2C). To assess the extent of proliferation resulting from sus-
tained aberrant signaling, we examined expression of the pro-
liferation marker Ki-67 and the mitotic marker p-Histone H3.
Increased phosphorylation of Histone H3 is also associated
with chromatin accessibility and forms part of an epigenetic
regulatory mechanism required for malignant transformation
[25, 26]. A sustained increase in proliferating cells was seen
throughout both LFA- and LNT-induced lesions (Figure 3B).
Oxidative DNA damage is often characteristic of chronic inflam-
mation [27] and facilitates epigenetic modifications, thereby
promoting
carcinogenesis
[28].
Importantly,
the
level
of
8-hydroxy-20-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), a marker of oxidative
stress and genotoxicity, progressively increased to a similar de-
gree in DNA samples from both LFA- and LNT-induced lesions
(Figure 3C).
LNTs and LFA Display Similar Carcinogenic Potential in
the Pleura of Exposed Animals
To explore the carcinogenic potential of long fibers in the
pleura, we examined fiber-induced pathology at later time
points (12–20 months) following exposure to LNTs or LFA. All
fiber-exposed animals displayed advanced pleural lesions
with mesothelial hyperplasia, fibrosis, and chronic inflammation
(Figures 4A and 5A). In 10%–25% of animals across three inde-
pendent studies, LNT-induced lesions progressed to pleural
mesothelioma (1/4 wild-type animals exposed to 2.5 mg LNTs
for 1 year; 1/4 animals exposed to 1 mg LNTs for 18 months,
1/5 animals exposed to 0.5 mg LNTs, and 1/12 animals
exposed to 0.2 mg LNTs for 20 months) (Figures 4A, S5, and
S7). Out of 32 animals exposed to asbestos (25 mg or 50 mg)
for 18–20 months, three mice developed mesothelioma (Fig-
ure S6). This incidence of mesothelioma is consistent with the
15%–37% (overall or high levels of exposure, respectively) re-
ported in humans exposed to asbestos [29].
Both LNT- and LFA-induced tumors, involving the chest wall,
diaphragm, and pericardium, stained positive for the mesothelial
markers pan-cytokeratin and WT1 and exhibited histopathology
consistent with malignant mesothelioma [30] (Figures 4B, S6A,
and S7A). Aberrant signaling pathway activation, observed in
earlier lesions (Figures 2C and S4), was sustained in the LNT-
induced tumors (Figure S5C).
To explore the molecular events underlying progression of
LNT- and LFA-induced inflammatory lesions to mesothelioma,
was examined the status of the tumor suppressor gene
Cdkn2a and its products p16 and p19, known to be disrupted
in asbestos-induced mesothelioma in humans [31, 32] (Fig-
ures 4B–4E, S6, and S7). Large areas of LNT-induced tumor
(#610) or LFA-induced tumor (#398), which were predomi-
nantly negative for p16 or p19 protein expression, were mi-
cro-dissected and examined for p16Ink4a and p19Arf status
(Figure 4C). In LNT-induced tumors, relative quantification of
gene copy number [33] confirmed loss of the p19Arf locus in
the p19-negative areas, as evidenced by �60% reduction in
p19Arf genomic DNA (gDNA) compared to controls (Figure 4D).
Loss of p16Ink4a, which is frequently co-deleted with p19Arf
[34], was not detected at this stage (Figures 4D), suggesting
that allelic deletion of p19Arf is an early event in LNT-induced
carcinogenesis and indicating an alternative mechanism for
p16 protein loss. Similarly, LNT tumor (#461) induced by a
lower fiber dose (1 mg versus 2.5 mg) displayed loss of
p16 and p19 protein expression, a reduction in Cdkn2a
mRNA, and allelic loss of p19Arf (Figure S7). In LFA-induced
mesothelioma, loss of p16 and p19 protein was evident by a
patchy pattern of immunostaining (Figure 4E) and reduced
Cdkn2a mRNA levels (Figure S6B), although no reduction
in p19Arf gene copy number was detected at this stage
(Figure S6C).
Both LNTs and LFA Induce Disruption of Tumor
Suppressor Genes in the Mesothelial Cells of
Inflammatory Lesions
The molecular changes that occur during the latency period of
mesothelioma and drive the transition from pre-neoplastic to
neoplastic stage of disease are largely unknown. To explore
whether disruption of Cdkn2a occurred prior to tumor develop-
ment, we examined the status of Cdkn2a in laser-dissected
mesothelial cells from advanced inflammatory lesions. LNT-
induced chronic inflammatory lesions from animals that did not
develop tumors at the 1 year study end point (Figure 5A) dis-
played no reduction in p16Ink4a or p19Arf gene copy number (Fig-
ure 5D); however, mRNA levels were reduced (data not shown),
and both p16 and p19 protein expression was absent in the
majority of mesothelial cells in LNT-induced lesions (Figures
5B and 5C). Consistent with loss of the CDKN2A-encoded
proteins p16/p14 in human mesothelioma, loss of p16 and p19

 protein expression was also evident in advanced LFA-induced
lesions from animals that did not develop mesothelioma at the
1 year study end point (Figures 5B and 5C). No loss of NF2-en-
coded Merlin expression was detected in either LFA- or LNT-
induced tumors (Figure 5E). Mesothelial expression of Merlin in
the LFA- and LNT-induced inflammatory lesions was not altered
(data not shown).
DNA hypermethylation is frequently associated with tumor
suppressor gene transcriptional inactivation. Importantly, loss
of function often occurs during the early stages of carcinogen-
esis and predominately at the pre-cancerous stage [7, 8]. To
explore possible epigenetic mechanisms of fiber-induced carci-
nogenesis, we examined gDNA from animals with advanced
LNT-induced inflammatory lesions and inflammatory lesions
and/or tumors from animals with LNT-induced mesothelioma
(#610 and #461), as well as inflammatory lesions and/or tumors
from animals with LFA-induced mesothelioma (#398), for
p16Ink4a or p19Arf methylation status. Bisulphite sequencing
confirmed hypermethylation of CpG islands in p16Ink4a and
p19Arf (located in exon 1a and the 50 region flanking exon 1b,
respectively) in mesothelial cells in advanced LNT- and LFA-
induced lesions, as well as in LFA- and LNT-induced tumors,
compared with VC (Figures 6 and S7E).
DISCUSSION
Here, we show for the first time that common molecular events
underlie the development of LFA- and LNT-induced pleural le-
sions that progress to mesothelioma (Figure 7). Aberrant cell
signaling was detected as early as 1 week post-instillation and
sustained during the entire time of disease progression, including
end-stage disease, in mice. Importantly, this pattern of pro-onco-
genic signaling was strikingly similar in mesothelioma patients.
The potential role of the stromal component of human mesotheli-
oma in tumor progression has been highlighted previously [35,
36]. In this regard, we now show that sustained activation of
pro-oncogenic signaling pathways in fiber-induced lesions oc-
curs largely in non-mesothelial (stromal) cells as fiber-induced le-
sions progress. Our data therefore suggest that proliferation of the
mesothelial cell layer and the presence of ‘‘reactive’’ (changed
morphology) mesothelial cells within the lesions occurs as a
consequence of the crosstalk between stromal cells with acti-
vated pro-oncogenic pathways and target mesothelial cells.
Inflammatory signals cause alterations in the cellular epige-
netic program and induce hypermethylation [37]. The presence
of oxidative DNA damage could also contribute to pro-onco-
genic events within the microenvironment, favoring aberrant
DNA methylation in target cells [38], with hypermethylation of
Cdkn2a (Ink4a/Arf) in LNT- and LFA-induced lesions prior to
tumor development leading to allelic loss of p19Arf, as has
been suggested in other cancers [17]. Consistent with a role
for hypermethylation, DNMT3a and DNMT3b mRNA levels
were increased in mesothelial cells from LFA- and LNT-induced
tumors (data not shown).
Alteration of the CDKN2A locus in human malignant mesothe-
lioma has been reported with inactivation of p16 in more than
a half of mesothelioma patients [9] and, in more recent
studies, with hypermethylation and silencing of p19 in 44% of
patients [39].
Significantly, we discovered that epigenetic silencing of
Cdkn2a (Ink4a/Arf) and deletion of p19Arf observed in LNT-
induced tumors recapitulates common features of human
asbestos-induced mesothelioma (Figure 7). Overall, these find-
ings provide important new insights into the early molecular
changes that occur during the long latency period between fiber
exposure and mesothelioma development and identifies epige-
netic and/or genetic disruption of Cdkn2a as a key event in
long-fiber-induced malignant transformation (Figure 7). Impor-
tantly, these findings facilitate the identification of potential
biomarkers for earlier detection of asbestos-induced mesotheli-
oma, as well as the development of new therapeutic avenues
by which to tackle early-stage disease.
Immunostaining of both LFA-and LNT-induced mesotheli-
omas for the tumor suppressor protein BAP1 revealed positive
cytoplasmic staining in all tumor cells and positive nuclear stain-
ing in �10% tumor cells (data not shown). In view of the latest
findings of separate activities of BAP1 in the nucleus and cyto-
plasm, as well as a possible requirement for both cytoplasmic
and nuclear forms to exert a tumor suppressor function, the
molecular involvement of BAP1 in carbon nanofiber-induced
carinogenesis will be a focus of our future work.
The long latency of malignant mesothelioma, with decades-
long chronic inflammation accompanied by an aberrant micro-
environment and the presence of ROS and oxidative DNA
damage, would advocate a multifactorial mechanism of disease
development, with a clear contribution via loss of tumor suppres-
sor genes such as p16 and p19, as reported here.
Overall, the common signature of LFA- and LNT-induced
pathology demonstrates that there is a conserved molecular
mechanism through which long fibers induce pleural disease,
including mesothelioma, and crucially our data place long
CNT
fibers
on
the
same
adverse
outcome
pathway
as
asbestos. Notably, other nanofibers have been shown to pro-
duce length-dependent inflammatory effects in the pleura
similar to LNTs [40], suggesting that any respirable long fiber
that is biopersistent may pose a similar hazard. Given that
the increasing manufacture of long CNT fibers raises the poten-
tial for human exposure, our findings reinforce the need for
caution when using these agents if long-term harm is to be
avoided.
(B) Loss of p16 expression in mesothelial cells in LNT- and LFA-induced inflammatory lesions. Representative images of immunostaining for p16 show pre-
dominantly negatively stained (black arrows) and only a few (boxed) positively stained (green arrows) mesothelial cells. Scale bars, 100 mm.
(C) Loss of p19 protein expression in mesothelial cells in LNT- and LFA-induced inflammatory lesions. Representative images of immunostaining for p19 show
predominantly negatively stained (black arrows) and only a few (boxed) positively stained (green arrows) mesothelial cells. Scale bars, 100 mm.
(D) Relative quantification (mean of 2�DDCT) of p16 Ink4a and p19Arf gene copy number by qPCR analysis in gDNA isolated from positively and negatively stained
mesothelial cells in the LNT-induced inflammatory lesions (animal IDs: nos. 621, 622, and 623) compared to controls.
(E) Immunostaining for the NF2-encoded protein Merlin in LNT (animal ID: no. 461) and LFA (animal ID: no. 398) tumors. Representative images show positive
cytoplasmic staining of tumor areas. Scale bars, 100 mm.

from mesothelial cells in chronic inflammatory lesions of LNT-exposed animals that did not develop tumors at the 1 year study endpoint (animal IDs: nos. 621, 622,
ad 623; blue-filled circles). The call-out shows a region of bisulphite converted sequence with unconverted cytosines (arrows).
(B) Schematic representation of the hypermethylation status of the 50 p19Arf CpG island located upstream of exon 1b determined by bisulphite sequencing. All
CpG dinucleotide positions are shown by vertical lines. Hypermethylated CpG sites were identified in p19-negative areas of LNT-induced tumor (no. 610; red-
filled circles), in mesothelial cells isolated from inflammatory non-neoplastic lesions of the same animal (hatched circles), and in mesothelial cells isolated from
chronic inflammatory lesions of LNT-exposed animals that did not develop tumors at the 1 year study endpoint (animal IDs: nos. 621, 622, and 623; blue-filled
circles). Callouts show examples of unconverted cytosines in hypermethylated CpGs. Results are summarized in the table, where each yellow-filled square
represents multiple sequencing runs (unconverted CpG detected in 10–60 clones compared to none in VC).
(C) Schematic representation of the hypermethylation profile of the p16Ink4a CpG island in exon 1a and the 50 p19Arf CpG island located upstream of exon 1b
determined by bisulphite sequencing. Hypermethylated CpG sites were identified in gDNA extracted from p16-negative areas of LFA-induced tumor (animal
ID: no. 398; red-filled circles) and in gDNA from mesothelial cells in chronic inflammatory lesions of LFA-exposed animals that did not develop tumors at the
1 year study endpoint (animal IDs: nos. 616–620; blue-filled circles). The callout shows a region of bisulphite converted sequence with unconverted
cytosines.

 EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Experimental animals
Eight-week-old female C57BL/6 strain mice (Charles River Laboratories, UK) were used in this study. Mice were kept in a maximal
group size of five in standard caging with sawdust bedding within a pathogen-free Home Office approved facility. Mice were main-
tained on a normal 12 hr light and dark cycle. Prior to treatment, mice were kept for 7 days in the facility to acclimatize. The work was
carried out by staff holding a valid UK Home Office personal license under a Home Office approved project license.
Human subjects
Informed consent was obtained from all subjects with Ethical Committee Approval – LREC 08/H0406/226. Tissues from 13 patients
were analyzed in this study, including 1 female and 12 males aged 45–78 years [41].
Fiber samples
The fiber panel consisted of one sample of short, straight CNT (SNT), one sample of long, straight CNT (LNT), short-fiber amosite
asbestos (SFA) and long-fiber amosite asbestos (LFA). The SNT sample, produced by the catalytic vapor discharge method
(CVD), was purchased commercially (Nanostructured & Amorphous Materials, TX, USA). The LNT sample was produced in an aca-
demic research laboratory (University of Manchester, Manchester, UK) using the CVD method. Mixed-length amosite asbestos en-
riched for long fibers (LFA), and shortened amosite asbestos [17] were used to link the response to asbestos pathogenicity. Both LFA
and SFA were created from the same batch of South African amosite [18] obtained from the Manville Corporation, United States. SFA
was prepared by grinding long fibers in a ceramic ball mill, and the resulting fiber preparation sedimented in water. Physical charac-
teristics (diameter and length) were measured from scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) images of the dispersed fiber samples, as previously described by Poland et al. [11] (Figure S1). Trace soluble metal contam-
inants previously tested and reported by Poland et al. [11] were low and, thus, not considered to play a role in these studies.
Intrapleural injection
Injection directly into the pleural space without perforating the lungs was enabled by the addition of a sleeve over the tip of the
27-Gauge needle, which prevented the needle from passing through the pleural space into the lungs [1]. Mice were randomly allo-
cated to the treatments and received injection of one of the following: vehicle control (VC), SFA, LFA, SNT or LNT. For 1 and 12 weeks
exposure, CNT samples were injected into the pleural cavity at a dose of 5 mg/mouse, n = 4 in each treatment group. For 6 months and
1year exposure, the treatments were as follows: VC, LFA and LNT, with n = 4 in each treatment group, at a dose of 2.5 mg/mouse
(100 mL) of LNT. For prolonged (up to 20 months) exposure, mice were injected with 1 mg/mouse of LNT (n = 4), 0.5 mg/mouse of
LNT (n = 5) or 0.2 mg/mouse of LNT (n = 12). Asbestos fiber samples were administered at a dose of 25 mg/mouse (100 mL) (n = 4
for short-term studies and n = 16, prolonged exposure) or at 50 mg/mouse (n = 16, prolonged exposure). 0.5% BSA/saline
(100 mL) was injected into mice as a vehicle control (VC). After 1 week, 12 weeks, 6 months, 1 year and 18-20 months, mice were
humanely killed and tissues were collected for further examination. Animal IDs, indicated in the Figures, were as follows: #610 -
LNT-exposed mouse that developed mesothelioma at 1 year study completion point; ## 621, 622, 623 - LNT-exposed mice that
did not have a tumor at 1 year study completion point; ## 612, 613, 614, 615 - VC; #398 - LFA-exposed mouse; #461 - low-dose
LNT-exposed mouse that developed mesothelioma after 17 months exposure; ## 616-620 - LFA-exposed mice with inflammatory
lesions.
METHOD DETAILS
Experimental Design
All experiments were reproduced in at least three biological repeats. For in vivo experiments, sample sizes were chosen on the basis
of prior experiments which have elicited significant results with a similar number of mice. With the exception of histological analysis,
data collection and analyses were not performed blind. Data were considered statistically significantly different at p < 0.05. No data
were excluded from any dataset.
Tissue dissection
The lower-right posterior portion of the chest wall and half of the diaphragm were carefully removed from the mice. The tissue was
washed in ice-cold saline, fixed in 10% formalin for 4 hr and transferred to 70% ethanol. Samples were embedded in paraffin,
sectioned, and used for H&E, immunostaining and PALM microdissection. The pleurae were dissected from the surface of the chest
wall and snap frozen for kinome profiling. The other half of the diaphragm was snap frozen for RNA extraction and PALM
microdissection.
Kinome profiling
Kinome profiling was performed using Phospho-Kinase Array Kit according to manufacturer’s protocol (R&D Systems, Oxford, UK).
Pleural tissues from fiber-exposed and control mice were collected by dissection, homogenized and lysed, the lysates from
the pleurae of 4 animals were pooled for each treatment group. Lysates, cleared by centrifugation, were loaded onto the provided

e3
 membranes pre-coated with capture antibodies, and the presence of bound phospho-proteins was determined by western blotting
with a mixture of detection antibodies. The signal intensities for kinase phosphorylation were determined in duplicate by densitometry
and normalized on the provided positive control. The status of kinase phosphorylation in the pleurae of fiber-exposed animals is re-
ported relative to the vehicle control.
RNA microarrays
Total RNA from control and fiber-exposed animals (n = 4) was extracted by TRIzol (Fisher Scientific, Loughborough, UK) and then
used for labeling and hybridization. Hybridization to 60K whole mouse genome microarray gene expression chips was conducted
following manufacturer’s protocol (Agilent Technologies, Berkshire, UK). Briefly, total RNA from control and fiber-exposed mice,
12 weeks post-injection, was used for labeling and hybridization. RNA samples were Cy3-labeled using Agilent Low Input Quick
Amp 1-color Labeling Kit (Agilent Technologies, Berkshire, UK). The level of dye incorporation was evaluated using a spectropho-
tometer (Nanodrop ND1000, LabTech). Labeled RNA was then fragmented in the appropriate buffer (Agilent Technologies, Berkshire,
UK) for 30 min at 60�C before dilution (v/v) in hybridization buffer. Hybridization to 60K high-density oligonucleotide microarray slides
was performed in a microarray hybridization oven (Agilent Technologies, Berkshire, UK) overnight at 65�C. Following hybridization,
the slides were rinsed in gene expression wash buffers 1 and 2 and immediately scanned using a DNA Microarray Scanner (Model
G2505C, Agilent Technologies, Berkshire, UK).
Immunohistochemistry
Chest wall or diaphragm sections (5 mm) were deparaffinized with xylene and rehydrated. Antigen retrieval was carried out by incu-
bating the slides in citrate buffer (pH 6.0) at 95�C for 15 min. Sections were blocked with 10% goat serum for 30 min at room tem-
perature. Primary antibodies were diluted in 1% goat serum/0.1% BSA/PBS. Sections were incubated with primary antibodies (KEY
RESOURCE TABLE) overnight at 4�C. Sections were washed with Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) and incubated
with 3% H2O2 for 10 min at room temperature to block endogenous peroxidase activity. Sections were washed before incubation
with biotin-labeled secondary antibodies (anti-Rabbit: Abcam, pre-diluted; anti-Mouse: DAKO LSAB2 System-HRP, anti-Rat: Invi-
trogen Histostain Kit pre-diluted) for 30 min at room temperature. Staining was visualized using a HRP/DAB detection system Abcam
(Cambridge, UK) or Histostain-Plus detection System (Life Technologies). Control IHC experiments (data not shown) were performed
without primary antibody. All sections were counterstained with Gill’s hematoxylin and mounted for digital slide scanning using a Ha-
mamatsu slide scanner (NanoZoomer-XR Digital slide scanner C12000-01; Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, UK). An ImageJ Color
Balance Plugin, set with the same scaling factor for all images, was applied to all scanned images to normalize scanner background.
The proportion of each cell type in the lesions was determined by counting the number of positively stained cells in 5 random fields
of view and dividing by the total number of cells (between 700-1000 cells per cell-marker per treatment group were counted).
Quantification of Ki-67 and phospho-Histone H3-positive cells was carried out by counting the number of positively stained cells in
5 random fields of view and dividing by the total number of cells (between 700-1000 cells per animal were counted, n = 3 per group).
Data presented as mean ± SD. Statistical significance of data was estimated using two-tailed Student’s t test.
Laser microdissection and RNA analysis
Collection of tissues for RNA from selected areas of normal diaphragms (VC) and fiber-induced lesions (LFA, LNT) and collection of
tissues for genomic DNA (gDNA) from tumor areas, predominantly positively or negatively stained for p19 or p16 protein, and from
control tissues was performed by contact-free laser microdissection using the PALM Robot-MicroBeam system (P.A.L.M. Microlaser
Technologies AG, Bernried, Germany), Motorised Zeiss Observer Z.1 inverted microscope (Zeiss, Germany) with high precision XY
stage, pulsed UV laser and Robomover (PALM RoboSoftware, P.A.L.M. Microlaser Technologies AG, Germany). Laser catapulting
was used for non-contact capture of excised samples in microcentrifuge tubes. Total RNA was isolated by using TRIzol (Fisher Sci-
entific, Loughborough, UK). First strand cDNA synthesis was carried out using Superscript III (Fisher Scientific, Loughborough, UK).
PCR primers were selected using the Primer Express v3.0.1 Software program (Fisher Scientific, Loughborough, UK). Primer se-
quences are shown in Table S4. Primers were designed to cross exon-exon boundaries and the concentration optimized (300 -
900 nM) to ensure that the efficiency of the target gene amplification and the efficiency of the endogenous reference amplification
are approximately equal. Real-time PCR was performed using SYBR Green PCR Master Mix, primers, and 10 ng of reverse-tran-
scribed cDNA in the ABI PRISM 7500 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The thermal-cycler pro-
tocol was: stage 1, 50�C for 2 min; stage 2, 95�C for 10 min; and stage 3, 40 cycles at 95�C for 15 s and 60�C for 1 min. Each sample
was run in triplicate. The CT values for the target amplicon and endogenous control b2-microglobulin were determined for each sam-
ple. Quantification was performed using the comparative CT method DDCT). Data presented as mean ± SD (n = 4). Statistical signif-
icance was assessed as p < 0.05 using two-tailed Student’s t test.
Immunoblotting
Proteins were extracted from snap frozen freshly-resected mesothelioma tumor samples using lysis buffer (0.5% NP-40, 20 mM Tris-
HCl (pH 8.0), 137 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 2 mM EDTA, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 10 mg/mL leupeptin, and 10 mg/mL aprotinin) and
brief sonication and run on SDS-PAGE (20 mg protein). Proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad labora-
tories, Hemel Hempstead, UK) using electrophoresis. Membranes were pre-incubated with 5% skimmed milk in TBS-T. After
incubation with primary and secondary antibodies, bands were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (GE Healthcare, Little
e4
Current Biology 27, 3302–3314.e1–e6, November 6, 2017
 Chalfont, Buckinghamshire, UK) and visualized by exposure to X-ray films (Hyperfilm ECL; Amersham Biosciences, Chalfont St Giles,
UK). Primary antibodies were from the following sources:anti-STAT3, anti-phospho-Akt (Ser 473), anti-Akt, anti-phospho-p44/42
MAPK (ERK1/2) (Thr202/Tyr204), anti-p44/42 MAPK (ERK1/2), anti-phospho Src (Y418), anti-Src from Cell Signaling Technology,
(Buckinghamshire, UK); rabbit anti-phospho-Stat3 (Tyr705) from Abcam (Cambridge, UK), mouse anti-b Actin (loading control)
was from Sigma–Aldrich (Gillingham, UK).
DNA damage assessment
Genomic DNA was isolated from the diaphragms of mice exposed to LFA and LNT for 12 weeks or 6 months using a DNA isolation kit
GeneJET Genomic DNA Purification Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Paisley, UK); 8-OHdG was measured using an EpiQuik 8-OHdG
DNA Damage Quantification Direct Kit (Colorimetric) (Insight Biotechnology Ltd, Wembley, UK) according to manufacturer instruc-
tions and compared to VC (n = 4 per group). Briefly, 300 ng genomic DNA was bound to strip wells with high DNA affinity and 8-OHdG
was detected using capture and detection antibodies. The detected signal was enhanced and then quantified colorimetrically in a
microplate reader. Quantification was performed by using a standard curve and plotting the OD values versus the amount of positive
control at each concentration point. Data presented as mean ± SD. Statistical significance of the data was estimated using a two-
tailed Student’s t test.
Relative quantification of gene copy number by real-time PCR
An assay based on the paralog ratio test and real-time PCR was used to determine the DNA copy number in formalin fixed paraffin
embedded (FFPE) tissue as described previously [33]. Genomic DNA (gDNA) was extracted using PureLink Genomic DNA Mini Kit
(Fisher Scientific, Loughborough, UK) accordingly to the manufacturer’s instruction, from tumor areas positively and negatively
stained for p16 and p19, and control tissues including unaffected tissue (heart) from fiber-exposed mice, diaphragm tissue from
VC group, and liver tissue from a C57/Bl6 mouse. Commercially available murine gDNA from Swiss-Webster albino (CFW) mice
(Promega, Southampton, UK) was also included as a control. Briefly, PCRs were designed in which two target sequences were ampli-
fied by a pair of primers. The first gene in each pair was from a region of a frequent loss or deletion (p16 or p19), whereas the second
gene was the ‘‘housekeeping’’ gene, Supervillin, from a different chromosome. The Primer Express v3.0.1 Software program (Fisher
Scientific, Loughborough, UK), was used to identify primer pairs and to design minor groove-binding hydrolysis probes. Primer se-
quences (Sigma) and TaqMan Probes (Life Technologies) are listed in Table S4.
Real-time PCRs were performed on a 96-well plate on the ABI 7500 Fast system (Applied Biosystems Foster City, CA). Each of
10 mL reactions contained 3.4 mL of gDNA (5 ng), 0.3 mL of each of the two primers required for each locus (20 pmol/L), 0.2 mL of
each of the probes required (50 to 200 nmol/L), and 5 mL of Genotyping MasterMix (Applied Biosystems Foster City, CA). Master
mixes were prepared for each reaction, and the master mixes and DNA samples were transferred to 96-well plates using an electronic
multi-channel pipette. The PCR conditions were as follows: 2 min at 50�C; 10 min at 95�C; 15 s at 95�C and 60 s at 60�C. Fifty cycles
were performed. CT values were determined using the automatic threshold settings. Four samples of gDNA (unaffected heart tissue
from the same animal, diaphragm tissue from a VC mouse, liver from C57/BL6 mouse, and commercial gDNA from Swiss-Webster
albino (CFW) mice (Promega, Southampton, UK) were used as controls.
Bisulphite sequencing
Genomic DNA from selected areas of tumor or from mesothelial cells in the inflammatory lesions was isolated using GeneJET
Genomic DNA Purification Kit (Fisher Scientific, Loughborough, UK) and was bisulphite converted and recovered with EZ DNA
Methylation-Direct Kit (Cambridge Bioscience, Cambridge UK), as recommended by manufacturer. The PCR to amplify CpG islands
in the genes of interest was performed on a 3Prime Thermal Cycler (Bibby Scientific Limited, Stone, UK) using EpiMark Hot Start Taq
DNA Polymerase (New England Biolabs Ltd, Herts, UK). The PCR conditions were as follows: 95�C for 3 min, then 40 cycles of 95�C
for 30 s, 55�C for 30 s and 67�C for 2 min. A final incubation at 67�C for 10 min concluded the PCR. Positive control (Universal Meth-
ylated Mouse DNA Standard, Millipore Ltd, Watford, UK) and control (normal mesothelial tissue from VC) samples were included in
each PCR reaction. PCR products were verified by gel electrophoresis, and a small aliquot of the PCR reaction was used with the
TOPO-TA cloning system (Thermo Scientific, Paisley, UK) as suggested by the manufacturer. Clones were picked from Lysogeny
Broth-Ampicillin cultures, and were then screened using restriction analysis. Positive clones were sequenced using M13 primer
by the University of Leicester DNA Sequencing Facility. 25-100 clones were analyzed for each described experimental condition.
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Analysis of microarray data
Data were verified to be normally distributed. The raw data was uploaded into Agilent’s GeneSpring Software, normalized and fold
changes calculated. For each group of animals the probes with an absolute 2-fold-change in mRNA expression between VC and fi-
ber-exposed mice were included in subsequent analyses. These were subjected to ANOVA unequal variations test with Benjamini-
Hochberg corrections. Significant 2-fold or more changes (p < 0.05) were subjected to hierarchical clustering with average linkage.
The clustered heat-map was visualized using GeneSpring. The network pathways were identified using Ingenuity Pathways Analysis
software (Ingenuity Systems, Redwood City, CA).

 Quantification of Ki-67 and phospho-Histone H3 positive cells
Quantification of Ki-67 and phospho-Histone H3 positive cells was carried out by counting the number of positively stained cells in 5
random fields of view and dividing by the total number of cells (between 700-1000 cells per animal were counted, n = 3 per group).
Data presented as mean ± SD. Statistical significance of data was estimated using two-tailed Student’s t test.
Quantification of DNA damage
Quantification of DNA damage was performed by using a standard curve and plotting the OD values versus the amount of positive
control at each concentration point. Data presented as mean ± SD. Statistical significance of the data was estimated using a two-
tailed Student’s t test.
Real time PCR
Quantification was performed using the comparative CT method (DDCT). Data presented as mean ± SD (n = 4 for each group). Sta-
tistical significance was assessed as p < 0.05 using two-tailed Student’s t test.
Relative quantification of gene copy number by real-time PCR
The DCT score was calculated for each of the reactions using the following equation: CT gene 1 � CT gene 2 = DCT, where gene 1 is
that of common DNA loss and gene 2 is the reference. The mean DCT from the triplicate reactions was used for subsequent analysis.
A series of four gDNA samples acted as control for each PCR run. The relative quantification of copy number was calculated using
the 2-DDCT value. Z scores for the controls and predominantly p19 negative tumor areas were generated using the mean and SD of a
reference population comprising the four control DCT values. This was used to determine which samples were outside of the 99%
reference range for control, with those outside of this range being considered aneuploid.
