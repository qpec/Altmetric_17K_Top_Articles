Complete loss of BRCA1 or BRCA2 function is associated with sensitivity to DNA damaging
agents. However, not all BRCA1 and BRCA2 germline mutation-associated tumors respond.
Herein we report analyses of 160 BRCA1 and BRCA2 germline mutation-associated breast and
ovarian tumors. Retention of the normal BRCA1 or BRCA2 allele (absence of locus-specific loss
of heterozygosity (LOH)) is observed in 7% of BRCA1 ovarian, 16% of BRCA2 ovarian, 10% of
BRCA1 breast, and 46% of BRCA2 breast tumors. These tumors have equivalent homologous
recombination deficiency scores to sporadic tumors, significantly lower than scores in tumors
with locus-specific LOH (ovarian, P = 0.0004; breast P < 0.0001, two-tailed Student’s t-test).
Absence of locus-specific LOH is associated with decreased overall survival in ovarian cancer
patients treated with platinum chemotherapy (P = 0.01, log-rank test). Locus-specific LOH
may be a clinically useful biomarker to predict primary resistance to DNA damaging agents in
patients with germline BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations.

 A
pproximately 5% of breast and 20% of ovarian cancers
arise in women carrying heterozygous germline mutations
in the cancer susceptibility genes BRCA1 or BRCA21.
Germline BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in women are associated
with an increased lifetime risk of breast and ovarian cancers2, 3.
BRCA1
and
BRCA2
are
critical
in
double
strand
break
repair utilizing homologous recombination (HR)4, disruption of
which leads to high levels of genomic instability in BRCA1 and
BRCA2 germline mutation-associated ovary5 and breast6 tumors.
These tumors require additional somatic mutations, as in TP53,
to suppress induction of DNA damage cell-cycle checkpoints,
as otherwise genomic instability leads to cell-cycle arrest or
apoptosis7.
BRCA1 and BRCA2 are canonical tumor suppressor genes;
loss of the non-mutated (wild-type) allele at the BRCA1 or
BRCA2 locus, termed locus-specific loss of heterozygosity (LOH)
is
observed
in
tumors8,
9.
Cells
with
complete
loss
of
BRCA1 or BRCA2 function and resultant HR-based DNA
repair deficiency (HRD) have exquisite sensitivity to DNA
damaging agents, such as platinum-based chemotherapeutics10
and PARP inhibitors11, 12. Tumors in BRCA1 and BRCA2
mutation carriers show high sensitivity to these agents in clinical
trials13–17. The sensitivity of BRCA-deficient cells to platinum
agents is due to the inability of cells to repair damage-induced
lesions
such
as
interstrand
crosslinks10.
PARP
inhibitor
sensitivity relies, in part, on a synthetic lethal interaction resulting
from the inability of BRCA-deficient cells to repair stalled
replication forks generated by PARP trapping on DNA18, 19.
Cells with heterozygous BRCA mutations are significantly less
sensitive to platinum agents and PARP inhibitors than cells
with homozygous mutations, both in vitro12, 20–24 and in mouse
models24, suggesting that complete loss of BRCA1 or BRCA2
function is a requirement for efficacy of these therapeutics.
When treated with platinum chemotherapy and PARP inhibitors,
individuals with and without BRCA1 and BRCA2 germline
mutations have the same rates of adverse effects related to cell
death in rapidly proliferating tissues, such as the gastrointestinal
tract and hematopoietic system, further demonstrating the lack
of sensitivity of heterozygous cells15, 16. These data support
a requirement for homozygous loss of BRCA1 or BRCA2 func-
tion for sensitivity to DNA damaging agents.
Although clinical trials report excellent response rates of
tumors in patients with germline BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations
to platinum chemotherapy and PARP inhibitors13–17, primary
resistance has been noted25–27. Genomic studies have suggested
that a subset of germline BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation-associated
tumors may not have BRCA locus-specific LOH28–30. Reversion
to the heterozygous state and presumed restoration of BRCA1 or
BRCA2 function has been noted as a mechanism of secondary
resistance20, 21, 31. However, the rates of primary resistance due to
maintenance of the heterozygous state (absence of locus-specific
LOH) and its relationship to genomic measures and clinical
outcomes are currently unknown.
We have performed an in-depth examination of the genomic
profiles of primary breast and ovarian tumors in patients
with germline BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations with the goal of
identifying correlates of therapeutic response, using two data
sets. The first data set was derived from The Cancer Genome
Atlas (TGCA). The second independent data set was uniformly
generated from patients seen at our institution, and a tissue
microarray was available for correlative studies on a subset of
tumors. We show that a proportion of BRCA1 and BRCA2
germline mutation-associated tumors do not have locus-specific
LOH. Absence of locus-specific LOH is associated with a lack of
genomic measures of BRCAness, and, in ovarian cancer, poorer
overall survival when treated with platinum chemotherapy. We
propose that locus-specific LOH may be an important clinical
tool to predict primary resistance to DNA damaging agents in
patients with BRCA1 and BRCA2 germline mutated-associated
tumors.
Results
Establishment of analysis pipeline. We established an analysis
pipeline for identification of genomic markers for BRCA1 and
BRCA2 functional deficiency (termed BRCAness19) and BRCA
locus-specific LOH from whole exome sequencing (WES) data.
Analysis of primary data from TCGA identified 100 breast
and ovarian tumors with germline BRCA1 (n = 55) and BRCA2
(n = 45) mutations (Supplementary Fig. 1, Supplementary Data 1,
Supplementary Table 1). We created a nonBRCA tumor set
(n = 764 breast, n = 215 ovary) from the remaining TCGA
tumors excluding tumors with somatic mutations in, homozygous
copy loss of, or transcriptional repression of BRCA1 and/or
BRCA2, and any breast tumors from patients who had received
neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
We identified BRCA mutational signatures32 using deCon-
structSigs33 and the Somatic Signatures nonnegative matrix
factorization (NMF) function34. When TCGA tumors were
stratified by mutation and tumor type, both BRCA1 and BRCA2
germline mutation-associated breast and ovarian tumors had a
significantly higher proportion of BRCA signature (Signature 3)
compared to nonBRCA breast and ovarian tumors (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 2a, b). In both analyses, there were no significant
differences between any groups of BRCA1 and BRCA2 germline
mutation-associated tumors, although nonBRCA ovarian tumors
had a significantly higher proportion of BRCA mutational
signature than nonBRCA breast tumors (Supplementary Fig. 2a,
b). Both BRCA1 and BRCA2 germline mutation-associated breast
and ovarian tumors had a significantly lower proportion of the
aging signature (Signatures 1 and 5) compared to nonBRCA
breast and ovarian tumors (Supplementary Fig. 2c). Only a small
proportion of BRCA1 and BRCA2 germline mutation-associated
breast and ovarian tumors (n = 3, 3%) and nonBRCA ovarian
tumors (n = 8, 4%) had over 20% of mutations attributed to any
signatures other than Signatures 1,3, and 5, with Signatures 2
(APOBEC) and 6 (defective mismatch repair) observed. In
contrast, 110 (16%) of nonBRCA breast tumors had over 20% of
their mutations attributed to other signatures (Signatures 2, 6, 10,
13, 15, 18, or 20) (Supplementary Fig. 2d).
We developed a method to calculate genomic loss of
heterozygosity (HRD-LOH)35, non-telomeric allelic imbalance
(HRD-NtAI)36, and large state transitions (HRD-LST)37 scores
from WES data using Sequenza38 derived allele-specific copy
number (ASCN) data (Supplementary Fig. 3a–c). When tumors
were stratified by mutation and tumor type, the means of these
three scores (HRD-Mean) were significantly higher in BRCA1
and BRCA2 germline mutation-associated breast vs. nonBRCA
breast tumors, and between BRCA1 germline mutation-associated
and
nonBRCA
ovarian
tumors
(Supplementary
Fig.
3d).
HRD-Mean scores were not significantly different between
BRCA1 and BRCA2 germline mutation-associated breast and
ovarian
tumors.
However,
nonBRCA
ovarian
tumors
had
significantly higher HRD-Mean scores than nonBRCA breast
tumors (Supplementary Fig. 3d). Of the TCGA breast and ovarian
tumors, 26 and 95% of samples, respectively, underwent whole
genome amplification (WGA) of tumor and/or normal DNA
prior to WES. WGA is known to affect mutational profiles,
copy number calls, and LOH calls39, 40. The proportion of
mutations due to the BRCA signature were significantly lower and
HRD-Mean scores were significantly higher for breast tumors
whose DNA was prepared using WGA (n = 180) compared

the genomic region containing the BRCA1 or BRCA2 locus
(Supplementary Data 2). Fifty-two of 55 BRCA1 germline
mutation-associated breast and ovarian tumors had locus-specific
LOH (Fig. 1, Supplementary Table 2), with two breast (11%) and
one ovarian (3%) tumors lacking locus-specific LOH. In contrast,
10 of 19 (53%) breast and four of 26 (15%) ovarian BRCA2
germline mutation-associated tumors did not have locus-specific
LOH (Fig. 1). The most common mechanism of locus-specific
LOH was copy neutral LOH in both breast and ovarian tumors
(Table 1). Tumors without BRCA locus-specific LOH may inac-
tivate the wild-type allele via alternative mechanisms. One BRCA1
and one BRCA2 breast tumor each had somatic pathogenic
mutations in the corresponding gene, at 21 and 35% allele fre-
quency, respectively (Table 1). These two tumors were included
in the group with locus-specific LOH for genomic analyses.
Promoter methylation analysis of TCGA data showed that
BRCA1 promoter methylation status in ovarian and breast tumors
correlates with BRCA1 but not BRCA2 expression levels (Sup-
plementary Fig. 5). BRCA1 promoter methylation as a mechan-
ism of inactivation of the wildtype allele in the BRCA1 tumors
without locus-specific LOH was not identified.

Fig. 1 Summary of BRCA locus-specific LOH status of breast and ovarian tumors from individuals with germline BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations. 100 tumors
with germline BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations were identified in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data set and 60 tumors underwent whole exome
sequencing (WES) at the University of Pennsylvania (Penn). BRCA locus specific loss of heterozygosity (LOH) was determined as described. *One BRCA1
breast tumor in the TCGA had a somatic BRCA1 mutation at 21% allele frequency and one BRCA2 breast tumor in the TCGA had a somatic BRCA2 mutation
at 35% allele frequency. These two tumors were removed from the totals for LOH negative tumors

 BRCA locus-specific LOH in Penn BRCA1 and BRCA2 tumors.
We performed WES on nascent DNA from 60 primary untreated
breast (n = 39) and ovarian (n = 21) tumors from individuals
with germline BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations seen at Penn
Medicine. We wanted to further explore BRCA locus-specific
LOH and its potential relationship with genomic measures
of BRCAness and clinical outcome in a uniformly sequenced
data set, not subjected to WGA, with well-annotated clinical
characteristics. Three of 23 (13%) breast and three of 15 (20%)
ovarian tumors associated with BRCA1 germline mutations,
and seven of 16 (44%) breast and one of six (17%) ovarian
tumors associated with BRCA2 germline mutations did not have
BRCA locus-specific LOH (Fig. 1, Supplementary Data 3,
Supplementary Table 2). With the exception of BRCA1 germline
mutation-associated ovarian tumors, the proportion of tumors
without locus-specific LOH was nearly identical in the Penn
and TCGA data sets (Fig. 1). The most common mechanism of
locus-specific LOH in this data set was copy neutral LOH in
BRCA1 tumors and LOH due to loss of the wild-type allele in
BRCA2 tumors (Table 1). No tumor had evidence of a second
somatic mutation. Methylation specific PCR was used to analyze
the BRCA1 promoter in BRCA1 tumors. Eight of 23 BRCA1
germline mutation-associated breast (one without and seven
with locus-specific LOH) and three of 15 BRCA1 germline
mutation-associated ovarian tumors (two without and one
with locus-specific LOH) had somatic promoter methylation
(Supplementary Fig. 6). Of note, the allelic distribution of
promoter methylation (wildtype vs. mutant allele vs. both) is not
possible using this technique.
BRCA1 immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed for
30 of 38 tumors associated with germline BRCA1 and 13 of
22
tumors
associated
with
germline
BRCA2
mutations.
Combining
tumors
with
both
diffusely
positive
and
heterogeneously positive nuclear staining, 12 of 13 tumors with
BRCA2 mutations had positive BRCA1 IHC; these tumors had
similar BRCA1 staining in nuclei of normal stromal tissue
(Table 2, Fig. 2a). In contrast, all BRCA1-mutated tumors with
locus-specific LOH had decreased or absent BRCA1 nuclear
staining compared to normal stromal cell nuclei within the tumor
(Table 2, Fig. 2b, Supplementary Figs. 7 and 8). In six tumors
with
BRCA1
locus-specific
LOH,
at
least
25%
of
tumor
nuclei retained positive BRCA1 staining, indicating intratumoral
heterogeneity; two had missense mutations and four had
truncating mutations in BRCA1. Four of the five tumors without
locus-specific LOH, all with truncating mutations and including
both with BRCA1 promoter methylation, showed either diffusely
or heterogeneously positive BRCA1 staining in tumor nuclei
similar to normal stromal cells (Table 2, Fig. 2c, Supplementary
Figs. 7 and 8). Therefore, the two tumors without BRCA1 locus-
specific LOH, but with promoter methylation, were included in
the group without locus-specific LOH for genomic analyses.
BRCA locus-specific LOH and genomic signatures of BRCA-
ness. Tumors in the Penn data set, all sequenced from nascent
DNA, had a similar distribution of mutational signatures
(majority Signatures 1 and 3) as the TCGA BRCA1/2 germline
mutation-associated tumors. Tumors in the Penn data set without
locus-specific LOH had a significantly lower proportion of BRCA
mutational signature (BRCA1, P = 0.007 and BRCA2, P = 0.02)
compared to tumors with locus-specific LOH, when mutational
signatures were analyzed by both NMF and deconstructSigs
(Fig. 2d). No significant differences in proportion of mutational
signature were observed in the TCGA data set; WGA may
alter these profiles (Supplementary Fig. 9a). Tumors without
locus-specific LOH in both data sets trended towards having
higher proportions of mutations due to Signature 1 (aging)
(Supplementary Fig. 9b, c). Five tumors without locus-specific
LOH had evidence of either Signature 2 or 13 (APOBEC)-asso-
ciated mutations (Supplementary Fig. 9d, e, Supplementary
Table 2).
Tumors without locus-specific LOH in the Penn data set had
significantly lower HRD-Mean scores compared to tumors with
locus-specific LOH for BRCA1 (P = 0.001) and BRCA2 (P = 0.01)
(Fig. 2e). Similar results were seen in the TCGA data set for both
BRCA1 (P < 0.0001) and BRCA2 (P = 0.01) (Supplementary
Fig. 10a). When BRCA1 and BRCA2 tumors in both data sets
were combined, despite differences in sequencing platform, both
ovarian and breast tumors associated with germline BRCA1 and
BRCA2 mutations without locus-specific LOH had significantly
lower HRD-Mean scores compared to ovarian and breast tumors
with locus-specific LOH (P < 0.0005) (Fig. 2f). HRD-Mean scores
in tumors without locus-specific LOH were similar to nonBRCA
tumors (Fig. 2f). To exclude a possible effect of WGA samples on
this result, the combined Penn and TCGA breast data were
reanalyzed including only TCGA tumors derived from nascent
DNA (all Penn tumors were derived from nascent DNA). In this
analysis, HRD-Mean scores remained significantly higher in
tumors with locus-specific LOH compared to both tumors
without locus-specific LOH and nonBRCA tumors (P < 0.0001,
Supplementary Fig. 10b).
Molecular correlates of BRCA locus-specific LOH. We evaluated
whether somatic mutations differed in BRCA1 and BRCA2
germline mutation-associated tumors with and without locus-
specific LOH. We identified single nucleotide and insertion/
deletion somatic mutations in the 60 Penn and 100 TCGA
tumors. Mutational burden was defined as the number of somatic
nonsynonymous mutations per megabase42. In the Penn data set,
BRCA1 germline mutation-associated tumors had an average of
0.96 ± 0.39
mutations/Mb
and
BRCA2
germline
mutation-
associated tumors an average of 1.08 ± 1.00 mutations/Mb,
consistent with mutational burden in studies of TCGA BRCA1

 and BRCA2 germline mutation-associated ovarian tumors43.
BRCA1
germline
mutation-associated
tumors,
with
and
without locus-specific LOH, had similar mutational burdens
(0.78 ± 0.20 vs. 1.00 ± 0.07, comparison not significant). How-
ever, BRCA2 germline mutation-associated tumors without locus-
specific LOH had a significantly lower mutational burden com-
pared to those with LOH (0.37 ± 0.11 vs. 1.41 ± 0.27, P = 0.02).
Mutational burden was similar between tumors with and without
locus-specific LOH in the TCGA data set (0.92 ± 0.36 vs. 1.29 ±
0.06, comparison not significant for BRCA1 and 0.99 ± 0.13 vs.
1.34 ± 0.11, P = 0.09 for BRCA2).
MutSigCV42 analysis identified only TP53 (q = 0) and PTEN
(q = 0.006) as significantly mutated genes in Penn BRCA1 and
BRCA2 germline mutation-associated tumors (Supplementary
Data 4). In the TCGA BRCA1 and BRCA2 germline mutation-
associated tumors, TP53 (q = 3.1e−12) and RB1 (q = 2.2e−5) were
significantly mutated; PTEN had q = 0.2 (Supplementary Data 5).
Both BRCA1 and BRCA2 germline mutation-associated tumors
without locus-specific LOH were significantly less likely to have a
TP53 mutation than BRCA1 and BRCA2 tumors with locus-
specific LOH (44 vs. 84%, P = 0.01 for BRCA1; 24% vs. 68%,
P = 0.001 for BRCA2). Beyond TP53 and PTEN, 41% of BRCA1
and BRCA2 germline mutation-associated tumors had a likely
pathogenic/pathogenic mutation in a cancer gene (defined as
COSMIC cancer gene census gene and/or as reported44) (Fig. 3).
Across the 160 tumors, six cancer genes had mutations in more
than two tumors: NF1 (8), PIK3CA (6), RB1 (6), ARID1A (4),
TDG (4), and ERCC6 (3). There were no differences in the
spectrum of cancer gene mutations between tumors with and
without locus-specific LOH (Fig. 3, Supplementary Table 3).
PTEN loss is a common feature of breast and ovarian tumors
associated with germline mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA245.
PTEN allele-specific copy number status by WES was compared
to PTEN status by IHC on 44 Penn tumors so that PTEN status
in tumors without IHC could be estimated (Supplementary
Fig. 11, Supplementary Table 4). Using this method, the rate of
PTEN loss did not differ significantly between tumors with and
without locus-specific LOH for BRCA1 and BRCA2 (38 vs. 30%,
and 32 vs. 21%, respectively).
Clinical correlates of BRCA locus-specific LOH. We next eval-
uated the association of BRCA locus-specific LOH with clinical
characteristics. No significant association between BRCA locus-
specific LOH status and age of cancer diagnosis, breast tumor
size, node positivity, or hormone receptor status or with ovarian
tumor grade was observed (Supplementary Table 5). In ovarian
cancer patients treated with adjuvant platinum based che-
motherapy, patients whose tumors lacked BRCA locus-specific
LOH had a significantly worse overall survival compared
to patients whose tumors had locus-specific LOH, similar to
nonBRCA patients (Fig. 4a). Absence of locus-specific LOH
remained significantly associated with overall survival using a
Cox proportional hazard model to control for site (Penn vs.
TCGA), stage at diagnosis, and gene (BRCA1 vs. BRCA2)
(Supplementary Fig. 12a, b). In breast cancer patients, absence of
locus-specific LOH was associated with better survival compared

 to nonBRCA patients but was similar to patients whose tumors
had locus-specific LOH (Fig. 4b). However, this was likely due to
an enrichment of Stage III and/or triple negative patients in the
nonBRCA group (Supplementary Fig. 12c).
Discussion
It has been previously assumed that all tumors associated with
germline BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations have locus-specific LOH,
and therefore loss of BRCA1 or BRCA2 function. However, large-
scale studies have suggested that not all tumors from individuals with
germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations have locus-specific LOH28–30,
and we hypothesized the absence of locus-specific LOH may be a
biomarker of primary resistance to platinums and PARP inhibitors.
In the TGCA and Penn data sets, most tumors with germline
mutations associated with BRCA1 had locus-specific LOH. Only
nine of 93 (10%) of BRCA1 tumors in the combined data set
lacked locus-specific LOH. All of the BRCA1 germline mutation-
associated tumors without locus-specific LOH had HRD-Mean
and BRCA mutational signature scores well below the mean
for tumors demonstrating locus-specific LOH. Thus, a small
percentage of BRCA1 germline mutation-associated tumors do
not display locus-specific LOH and lack a BRCAness phenotype.
Of the nine tumors lacking BRCA1 locus-specific LOH, three

 came from patients with a history of receiving chemotherapy for a
prior cancer, and three were tumors of types not typically asso-
ciated with BRCA1 germline mutations (an ovarian carcino-
sarcoma, one ER+ breast ductal carcinoma, and one ER+
breast lobular carcinoma), suggesting that second primary and
non-classic histological tumors may be enriched for absence of
locus-specific LOH.
We evaluated whether the presence or absence of locus-specific
LOH of BRCA1 was associated with retention of the protein
as measured by BRCA1 IHC. All tumors demonstrating locus-
specific LOH had decreased BRCA1 protein as compared to the
surrounding stroma, with most tumors demonstrating complete
absence of BRCA1 protein. However, of note, a subset of tumors
with BRCA1 locus-specific LOH retained BRCA1 expression in at
least 25% of nuclei. In contrast, in 80% (four of five) of tumors
without BRCA1 locus-specific LOH, BRCA1 protein was retained;
of these two also had BRCA1 promoter methylation. Although
promoter methylation of the wildtype allele would be expected to
result in absence of protein, these data are consistent with prior
studies showing approximately 20% of tumors with BRCA1
promoter methylation have retained BRCA1 protein46–48, which
could be due to promoter methylation of the mutant as opposed
to the wildtype allele. Overall, these results suggest that BRCA1
locus-specific LOH as measured genetically is a marker for
protein expression. However, we found that tumors associated
with BRCA1 mutations demonstrate heterogeneity in protein
expression, and thus bulk sequencing, promoter methylation
and LOH analysis may mask sub-populations of tumor cells that
vary in regards to BRCA1 locus-specific LOH.
Almost identical percentages of tumors associated with BRCA2
germline mutations in the TCGA and Penn set did not have
locus-specific LOH. Absence of locus-specific LOH was found at a
particularly high rate for BRCA2 germline mutation-associated
breast tumors (46%). Over 75% of BRCA2 germline mutation-
associated
tumors
without
locus-specific
LOH
had
HRD
scores significantly below the mean for tumors demonstrating
locus-specific
LOH.
Additionally,
we
identified
molecular
correlates associated with absence of locus-specific LOH, also
consistent with a lack of BRCAness, including a lower mutational
burden in tumors associated with BRCA2 germline mutations and
a significantly decreased frequency of TP53 mutations in tumors
associated with BRCA1 and BRCA2 germline mutations.
Tumors without locus-specific LOH in patients with BRCA1 or
BRCA2 germline mutations may arise due to various mechanisms
of carcinogenesis. Several tumors arose in patients previously
treated with chemotherapy and so subjected to other types of
DNA damage which may induce tumor formation irrespective of
germline BRCA status, although breast and ovarian cancers are
not typically considered chemotherapy-induced malignancies.
BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutant cells may be more sensitive in general
to chemotherapy49 which could thereby eliminate precancerous
clones promoting growth of tumors that are not fully deficient in
BRCA function. Tumors also may develop through mechanisms
similar to sporadic breast and ovarian tumors, related to estrogen
exposure or aging, for example. Supportive of this postulate is a
similar rate of an absence of locus-specific LOH in BRCA2
carriers in the two independent tumor sets, similar HRD-Mean
scores to nonBRCA tumors and higher percentage of aging
signature in those tumors without BRCA locus-specific LOH in
the Penn data set. However, age of cancer diagnosis was not
associated with LOH status and seven of 30 (23%) of the tumors
without BRCA locus-specific LOH developed in patients under
age 40, and 50% under age 50. As breast and ovarian cancers
diagnosed under age 50 are rare in the general population, these
data suggest possible alternate mechanisms of tumoriogenesis
related to the underlying inherited mutation. BRCA1 and BRCA2
heterozygous mutant states have been shown to contribute
to tumor formation in pancreatic and ovarian cancer mouse
models50, 51, consistent with studies that demonstrate that
haploinsufficiency for BRCA1 and BRCA2 leads to multiple levels
of cellular dysfunction29, 52–54. Radiation-induced tumors in
heterozygous Brca1 mice do not demonstrate locus-specific
LOH55. It is therefore possible that tumors without locus-
specific LOH in BRCA1 and BRCA2 germline mutation carriers
develop

 demonstrating that both human cell lines and mouse models
lacking BRCA1 or BRCA2, due to biallelic mutations or knock
out, are responsive to platinum and PARP inhibitors, whereas
those that retain some level of BRCA1 or BRCA2 function are
not12, 20–24. Our data support that BRCA locus-specific LOH is
necessary for tumors in BRCA1 and BRCA2 germline mutation
carriers to respond to platinum therapy, and potentially by
extension PARP inhibitors.
There are limitations to the current study. We are using locus-
specific LOH status to extrapolate BRCA1 or BRCA2 function.
As our data suggest the presence of intratumoral heterogeneity
protein expression of tumors associated with germline BRCA1
and BRCA2 mutation carriers, it is possible that further infor-
mation may be obtained by single cell analysis. Sub-populations
of cells within tumors may vary in terms of BRCA locus-specific
LOH, and thus responsiveness to DNA damaging agents.
In aggregate, our findings from the largest single study of
breast and ovarian tumors associated with BRCA1 and BRCA2
germline mutations suggest that locus-specific LOH may be a
biomarker for a BRCAness phenotype in whole tumor formalin-
fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) specimens. There are other
recently published BRCAness scores58, 59 which may predict
therapy response. However, these scores require additional tumor
genomic testing using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
arrays59 or whole genome sequencing58. Locus-specific LOH,
which can be determined from already existing DNA-based FFPE
tumor testing pipelines remains a clinically promising and more
cost-effective means of predicting therapy response in germline
BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers. Our findings need to be confirmed
prospectively, particularly in breast cancer patients stratified for
stage and therapy, but provide support for the use of a BRCA
locus-specific LOH assay to predict primary response to plati-
nums, and potentially PARP inhibitors, in patients with germline
BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations. Such an assay could have broad
applicability as germline BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations have been
associated with 3% of metastatic tumors of multiple subtypes60,
61. These results also emphasize that tumors associated with
germline BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, and likely tumors in
other carriers of mutations in DNA damage response genes,
should not be considered uniformly. Further study is needed to
investigate the precise role of the individual inherited mutations
in DNA damage response pathway genes in the development of
cancer, and whether or not locus-specific LOH may be useful to
predict response to DNA damaging agents in carriers of muta-
tions in other DNA damage response genes.
Methods
Identification of TCGA tumors with germline BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations.
Primary (Level 1) WES data was obtained to create the TCGA dat sets. To access
the Level 1 DNA sequencing data for breast and ovarian tumors from TCGA, a
project request was submitted and approved by the National Center for
Biotechnology Information Genotypes and Phenotypes Database (NCBI dbGaP)
Data Access Request system, Protocol #5309 “BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in
breast and ovarian cancer”. Breast and ovarian samples potentially with controlled-
access Level 1 WES binary alignment (.bam) files were identified from the Genomic
Data Commons (GDC) (https://gdc.cancer.gov/) (n = 1098 breast tumors and 590
ovarian tumors) (Supplementary Fig. 1). After filtering for samples with WES data
not available on the GDC commons (n = 406) and samples not passing our
sequencing pipeline quality control analysis (n = 104), 1178 tumor/normal pairs
were subjected to downstream analysis. Germline BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations
were identified using VarScan241 (http://dkoboldt.github.io/varscan/); and from
the normal variant calls of Mutect62 (https://github.com/broadinstitute/mutect)
and subjected to variant classification63. Tumors were determined to be associated
with germline BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations (n = 100) if they met the following
criteria: (1) known pathogenic BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation as per ENIGMA
classification in germline and tumor sample; (2) germline allelic fraction (AF)
>0.30; and (3) total depth >30 in germline and tumor at the mutation locus.
Germline mutations were confirmed by review of traces in the Integrated Genome
Viewer IGV (http://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/). We thus curated a
data set of 100 BRCA1 and BRCA2 germline mutation-associated breast and
ovarian tumors from the TCGA consisting of 37 breast (18 BRCA1 and 19 BRCA2)
and 63 ovarian tumors (37 BRCA1 and 26 BRCA2).
Identification of nonBRCA TCGA tumors. To create a nonBRCA tumor set
from the remaining 1078 tumor/normal BAM pairs (Supplementary Fig. 1),
we analyzed primary WES data using Mutect62, VarScan241, and Sequenza38
(https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sequenza/index.html). Tumors were
excluded if they were found to have: (1) a pathogenic somatic BRCA1 or BRCA2
mutation (n = 23 breast and n = 18 ovarian) and/or (2) homozygous copy number
deletion of BRCA1 or BRCA2 (n = 11 breast and n = 4 ovarian). Finally, Level 3
RNAseq z-scores, microarray Z-scores and HK27/HK450m methylation beta
values were bulk downloaded from The Cancer Genomics Hub of the University of
Santa Cruz (https://cghub.ucsc.edu/, project now completed) for the tumor/normal
pairs. Samples were excluded with z-scores < −1.5 and HK450m>0.5 for BRCA1
and RNAseq z-score < −1.5 for BRCA2 expression (n = 12 breast and 20 ovarian).
Breast tumors were also excluded from patients who had received neoadjuvant
chemotherapy (n = 11 breast).
Sample acquisition and preparation of Penn germline BRCA1 and BRCA2
mutated tumor set. The Penn study population was ascertained from academic
and community hospital sites within Penn Medicine and the Penn Cancer Net-
work. Acquisition of the patient samples was approved by the Institutional Review
Board of the University of Pennsylvania, and informed consent was obtained from
each participant for use of their samples and clinical data in genetic studies.
Eligibility criteria for the study were (1) diagnosis of breast or ovarian cancer; (2)
positive BRCA1/2 sequencing in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments-
approved laboratory; and (3) available archived blood DNA and FFPE tumor
blocks. Two hundred and twenty-three patients with breast and ovarian tumors
meeting criteria were identified and 151 blocks were available or received by a
central Pathology core (Supplementary Fig. 1). FFPE tumor blocks were sectioned
and stained with hematoxylin and eosin to ensure sections of over 70% invasive
tumor were used for DNA extraction, 68 tumors failed pathology quality control.
Selected tumor areas of slides or rolls were dissolved in Deparaffinization Solution
(Qiagen) and purified using Gentra PureGene Reagents (Qiagen) following
manufacturer's protocols. All DNA samples were quantitated with a Qubit and
tumor DNA was subjected to a quantitative PCR based QC Kit (Kapa Biosystems)
for analysis of DNA quality (sample QC), and 23 samples failed laboratory quality
control. This process resulted in a set 60 tumors, 38 from BRCA1 (23 breast,
15 ovarian tumors) and 22 from BRCA2 (16 breast, six ovarian tumors) mutation
carriers (Supplementary Fig. 1). Germline DNA from blood or saliva was extracted
using standard protocols in the laboratory. Library preparation of tumor and
matched germline DNA was as described64, 65. In all Penn cases, nascent DNA, not
subjected to WGA, was used for WES. Details of the Penn population are found in
Supplementary Table 1 and summarized in Supplementary Table 2. Libraries were
subjected to WES using the Agilent All-Exon Kit v5 (Santa Clara, CA). Tumors
were sequenced on an Illumina Hi-Seq 2000 to an average mean depth of 141× and
matched blood DNA was sequenced to an average mean depth of 155×.
Bioinformatics analysis and identification of somatic mutations in the Penn
and TCGA tumor set. Quality control measures were determined with Picard
Tools (https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/). Penn tumors and matched
germline were aligned to the hg19 assembly of the human genome using
Burrows–Wheeler Aligner for short-read alignment66 (http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.
net/). Variants underwent initial quality control filtering according to Genome
Analysis ToolKit (GATK)67 best practices. Downloaded TCGA BAM files had been
aligned to the hg38 assembly of the human genome. All exonic single nucleotide
and insertion/deletion variants were identified using a combination of GATK67
(https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/), Mutect62, and VarScan241. Variants
identified by initial bioinformatic analysis were annotated using ANNOVAR68
(http://annovar.openbioinformatics.org/en/latest/). Exonic variants were kept as
somatic variants if they met the following criteria: (1) alternate allele depth in
germline less than five reads; (2) population frequency <1% in EVS6500 (http://evs.
gs.washington.edu/EVS/) and 1000 genomes (http://www.1000genomes.org/)
databases; (3) not found in genomic regions of high (>89%) segmental duplica-
tions; (4) not categorized as synonymous variants; and (5) alternate allele
supported by greater than 10 reads in the tumor. Manual curation of variants using
a custom derived pipeline64 was used to classify variants as deleterious (D), likely
deleterious (LD), variants of uncertain significance (VUS), likely benign and benign
(B). Somatic mutations were defined as D or LD variants and rare VUS (variants
with population allele frequency <0.1%) in the tumors. MutSigCV (http://software.
broadinstitute.org/cancer/software/)42 was used to identify significantly mutated
genes. Cancer genes are those in the COSMIC cancer gene census (http://cancer.

 LOH positive status if the VarScan2 somatic P-value was significant and a locus-
specific LOH negative status if the VarScan2 germline P-value was significant.
Allele-specific copy number calls of the genomic region containing the BRCA1 or
BRCA2 mutation were determined by Sequenza. The copy number of the genomic
region surrounding the germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation (CN) and the
number of mutant (m) alleles as per the output of the Sequenza program were used
to assign two states of absent locus-specific LOH—heterozygous diploid (CN = 2;
m = 1) or amplified with gain of non-mutant (wildtype) allele (CN>2;m = 1)—and
three states of locus-specific LOH—loss (CN = 1;m = 1), copy neutral LOH
(CN = 2;m = 2), and amplified with LOH (CN>2;m>2). The genomic regions
surrounding the germline BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation ranged from less than one
to over 100 Mb in length. In cases where the VarScan2 and ASCN calls differed
(six of 100 TCGA tumors and four of 60 Penn tumors), the difference between
cellularity corrected tumor allele frequency and blood allele frequency (ΔAF) was
determined; the sample was assigned a locus-specific LOH positive status if
ΔAF>0.2028. Finally, five of 100 TCGA tumors had a germline BRCA1 or
BRCA2 mutation identified only by normal variant calling by Mutect; for these a
combination of ASCN and ΔAF was used to determine locus-specific LOH.
Determination of mutational signatures in the Penn and TCGA data sets.
Somatic mutations for determination of mutational signatures in the local and
TCGA data set were identified using the MuTect2 variant calls derived from
BAM files obtained as above. Mutational signatures were then extracted with the
SomaticSignatures program34 using r = 4 and NMF options simultaneously for
n = 80 Penn breast and ovarian tumors and n = 1186 TCGA breast and ovarian
tumors. In addition, the deconstructSigs program was additionally used to
determine the proportion of known mutational signatures in the data33. Using
deconstructSigs, 60 TCGA tumors had greater than 30% of their mutational
signatures due to sequencing artifact (signature R1–R3, U1–U2)32, including one
BRCA2 tumor without locus-specific LOH, three BRCA1 tumors with locus-specific
LOH, seven nonBRCA ovarian, and 49 nonBRCA breast tumors. These tumors
were therefore excluded from all subsequent genomic analyses. No Penn tumors
had greater than 10% of their mutational signatures due to sequencing artifact.
Mutational signatures were calculated blinded to locus-specific LOH status.
Determination of homologous recombination deficiency in the Penn and
TCGA data sets. Allele-specific copy number states were determined using
Sequenza and used to calculate the HRD scores NtAI36, LST37, and genomic
LOH (HRD-LOH)35 using custom R-scripts, which are available upon request.
Non-telomeric allelic imbalance (NtAI) scores were derived from the Sequenza
data by summing the number of segments of allelic imbalance that were
post-centromeric to the sub-telomeric regions and >11 Mb in length. Large
state transition scores were derived from the Sequenza data by summing the
number of breakpoints creating >3 Mb segments that were >10 Mb from one
another. Raw LST scores were corrected for ploidy (LSTm) using the equation
LSTm = LST–15.5 × ploidy. HRD-LOH scores were derived from Sequenza data
by summing the number of segments of LOH >15 Mb in length excluding
segments found on Chromosome 17. HRD scores were calculated blinded to
locus-specific LOH status.
Methylation specific PCR analysis of the BRCA1 promoter. Methylation specific
PCR analysis was performed using primers specific for unmethylated and
methylated BRCA1 promoter as described69, 70. Primers were obtained from
Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). Bands were resolved on a 6%
Tris-buffered EDTA (TBE) gel from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). A representative
full blot is found in Supplementary Fig. 6. Band intensity of samples was compared
to a fully methylated and an unmethylated control and a band intensity ≥ two-fold
of the band seen in the unmethylated control was considered positive for BRCA1
promoter methylation. Constitutional blood DNA was concurrently tested and
demonstrated an absence of constitutional methylation of the BRCA1 promoter in
tumors with positive BRCA1 promoter methylation. Methylation was quantified
blinded to locus-specific LOH status.
PTEN and BRCA1 immunohistochemistry. Tissue microarrays containing 44 of
the sequenced tumors were made. Sections were prepared of tumor and
surrounding normal tissue in triplicate for each sample available. Immunohis-
tochemistry was performed for BRCA1 using MS110 antibody from EMD
Millipore (Billerica, Massachusetts), staining for one tumor failed. Immunohis-
tochemistry was performed for PTEN using D4.3 antibody from Cell Signaling
Technology (Danvers, Massachusetts). Scoring for immunohistochemical stains
was performed in triplicate for each tissue sample. Stain intensity was graded on a
four-point scale (0–3) by a board-certified pathologist (A.B., M.F.), with 0 = no
staining, 1 = weak or partial staining, 2 = moderate staining, 3 = strong staining.
BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation and LOH status and PTEN allele-specific copy
number status was blinded. Two cell populations (tumor and non-tumor cell types)
were analyzed in each sample, and the intensity of cytoplasmic and nuclear staining
in each population was assessed independently. In addition, the percentage of cells
with the highest intensity of staining was also reported.
Use of allele-specific copy number calls at the genomic PTEN locus to
extrapolate PTEN status. To determine if PTEN allele-specific copy number
status by Sequenza38 based WES analysis accurately predicted protein loss, we
analyzed PTEN status by IHC on 44 tumors from the Penn data set as above
(Supplementary Fig. 11). All 10 tumors with PTEN copy number loss (n = 7) or a
truncating PTEN mutation with copy neutral LOH (n = 3) did not stain positively
for PTEN on IHC (Supplementary Table 4). Twenty-four of 25 tumors that had
wildtype PTEN with a copy number state of two or more had staining of PTEN on
IHC (concordance 97%). Of nine tumors without an identifiable mutation but copy
neutral LOH of PTEN on IHC: four stained positively and five did not stain for
PTEN. Given these results, for the 16 Penn tumors without available IHC data and
the 100 TCGA tumors, the ASCN state of the PTEN genomic locus was used to
extrapolate PTEN status. PTEN copy number loss or truncating mutation was used
to extrapolate PTEN loss (n = 15), and PTEN wildtype status at copy number two
or more to extrapolate retention of PTEN (n = 64). Eleven tumors with copy
neutral LOH were excluded from analysis.
Statistical and clinical data analyses. Means of continuous variables were
compared using a two-tailed Student’s t-test. Outliers were excluded based on
Grubb’s test (extreme studentized deviate test). Comparisons of rates in different
groups were determined using a two-tailed Fisher’s exact test of significance for two
groups or a one-way ANOVA with correction for multiple comparisons for three
or more groups. Clinical data were obtained for the patients in the Penn data set
by IRB approved chart review. The overall survival time for all patients was
determined from the date of diagnosis to the time of last follow-up or death by
query of the medical record for each Penn patient or by bulk data download
from The Cancer Genomics Hub of the University of California at Santa Cruz
(https://cghub.ucsc.edu/, project now completed) for the TCGA data set.
Patients alive at the end of follow-up were censored. Survival was compared using a
log-rank (Mantel–Cox) test. In addition, a Cox proportional hazards model was
used to examine the effect of locus-specific LOH status, site (TCGA vs. Penn) and
stage at diagnosis for ovarian cancer patients. For breast cancer patients, a Cox
proportional hazards model was used to examine the effect of locus-specific LOH
status, site (TCGA vs. Penn), stage at diagnosis, and hormone receptor status.
Kaplan–Meier curves were constructed for each analysis.
