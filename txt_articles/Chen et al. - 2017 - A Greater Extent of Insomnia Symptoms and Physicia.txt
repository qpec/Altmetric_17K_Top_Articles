Study Objectives: Cross-sectional studies suggest that insomnia symptoms are associated with falls in later life. This longitudinal study examines the 
independent and interactive effects of the extent of insomnia symptoms (i.e., multiple co-existing insomnia symptoms) and sleep medications on fall risk over a 
2-year follow-up among community-dwelling older adults.
Methods: Using data from the Health and Retirement Study (2006–2014, N = 6882, Mage = 74.5 years ± 6.6 years), we calculated the extent of insomnia 
symptoms (range = 0–4) participants reported (i.e., trouble falling asleep, waking up during the night, waking up too early, and not feeling rested). At each wave, 
participants reported recent sleep medications use and falls since the last wave, and were evaluated for balance and walking speed.
Results: A greater burden of insomnia symptoms and using physician-recommended sleep medications at baseline independently predicted falling after 
adjusting for known risk factors of falling. The effects of insomnia symptoms on fall risk differed by sleep medications use. The extent of insomnia symptoms 
exhibited a positive, dose-response relation with risk of falling among those not using sleep medications. Older adults using physician-recommended sleep 
medications exhibited a consistently higher fall risk irrespective of the extent of insomnia symptoms.
Conclusions: The number of insomnia symptoms predicts 2-year fall risk in older adults. Taking physician-recommended sleep medications increases the 
risks for falling in older adults, irrespective of the presence of insomnia symptoms. Future efforts should be directed toward treating insomnia symptoms, and 
managing and selecting sleep medications effectively to decrease the risk of falling in older adults.
Keywords: Falls, sleep medications, insomnia symptoms, older adults, balance, walking speed.
INTRODUCTION
Falls are a major health concern among older adults. Over 
30% of community-dwelling adults aged 65 years and older 
fall every year.1 Falls among older adults can result in injuries, 
impaired physical functioning (e.g., poor balance) and psycho-
logical functioning (e.g., depression), and a poorer health-re-
lated quality of life.2–4 Moreover, the annual cost for falls in the 
older population was estimated to be about US $23.3 billion in 
the United States.5 Therefore, it is imperative to identify factors 
that cause falls and initiate appropriate intervention to prevent 
future falls.
Older adults with sleep problems may be susceptible to fall-
ing. Research has shown that sleep problems (e.g., abnormal 
sleep hours and insomnia) are associated with several risk fac-
tors of falls,1 such as increased pain experience,6 depressive 
symptoms,7,8 functional limitations,7 slower reaction time,9,10 
cognitive performance,11 and physical functions (e.g., pos-
tural control and walking speed).12 As about 50% of commu-
nity-dwelling older adults report at least one sleep problem,7,13 
examining the relationship between sleep problems and falls 
will guide us toward one potential component of future preven-
tive interventions aiming to decrease falls in later life.
Previous longitudinal studies have identified diverse sleep 
problems that may relate to falls among older adults.9,14–17 
Specifically, studies found that falls were associated with 
habitual sleep duration <7 hours per night relative to 7–8 
hours of sleep (measured by wrist actigraphy or self-report 
hours),9,14,15 napping during the day (self-report),9,16 daytime 
sleepiness (measured by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale),15 being 
awake for more than 120 minutes after sleep onset (measured by 
wrist actigraphy),14 poor sleep quality while using sleep medi-
cations (measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and 
medication review),17 and poor sleep efficiency (measured by 
wrist actigraphy).14,15 Moreover, insomnia symptoms are a sig-
nificant burden for older adults that may increase future health 
risks, including falls. Several cross-sectional studies found that 
insomnia symptoms, such as trouble falling asleep, waking up 
during the night, waking up too early, and not feeling rested,18–20 
were associated with falls among older adults.
To date, however, no longitudinal study has investigated the 
association of insomnia symptoms with falls among commu-
nity-dwelling older adults. A longitudinal relationship between 
insomnia and falls has been observed in residents in nursing 
homes.21 Another study led by the same author excluded indi-
viduals in nursing homes,22 but the outcome was a combination 
of any accidental event (e.g., falls, cutting/piercing, and electro-
cution). Whether insomnia specifically relates to falls longitudi-
nally in community-dwelling older adults is unclear.
Older adults often have co-existing insomnia symptoms.7 
Examining multiple co-existing insomnia symptoms may 
Statement of Significance
Reporting a greater extent of insomnia symptoms independently increases the risk of falling among older adults. The extent of insomnia symptoms exhibits 
a dose-response relation with fall risk among individuals not using sleep medications. Older adults using physician-recommended sleep medications exhibit 
a consistently higher fall risk irrespective of their baseline number of insomnia symptoms and at any number of insomnia symptoms (from none to four 
symptoms). Treating insomnia while carefully selecting and closely monitoring the use of sleep medications may help reduce future falls in older adults.

capture more fragmented sleep and longer waking time when 
a person is supposed to sleep. However, previous studies pri-
marily focused on understanding the associations of the pres-
ence of insomnia or a single insomnia symptom report with 
falls.17,19,20 Whether older adults experiencing a greater number 
of insomnia symptoms are at a higher risk of falling is unknown. 
Moreover, prior studies17,19,20 did not take into account poten-
tially confounding effects of older adults’ physical performance 
(e.g., balance and walking speed) that may contribute to falls.1
Another aspect that is not clear is the role of sleep medications 
in the longitudinal relationship between the extent of insomnia 
symptoms and the risk of falling in older adults. Although physi-
cian-recommended sleep medications may result in adverse effects 
(e.g., ataxia or residual sedation)23,24 or indicate experiencing sleep 
problems and thus may relate to increased risk of falling,25–27 sleep 
medications may relieve insomnia symptoms among older adults24 
and could potentially reduce the risk of falling subsequently.
The current study examined the longitudinal association 
between multiple co-existing insomnia symptoms and falls, 
drawing upon data from a nationally representative sample 
of community-dwelling older adults in the United States. We 
hypothesized (H1) that older adults who had a greater number 
of insomnia symptoms at baseline would have an increased 
likelihood of falling in the future. Additionally, we hypothe-
sized (H2) that older adults who used physician-recommended 
sleep medications would have an increased likelihood of hav-
ing a fall in the future independent of the number of insomnia 
symptoms, physical performance, and other known risks of fall-
ing. Our third research question asked whether the use of phy-
sician-recommended sleep medications moderated the effect 
of the extent of insomnia symptoms on falls. We hypothesized 
(H3) that the impact of a great number of insomnia symptoms 
on fall risk would be different between individuals used phy-
sician-recommended sleep medications and those who did not 
use sleep medications. We did not expect to find this difference 
between using nonphysician-recommended sleep medications 
group and no medications group.
METHODS
Data
This study used data from the Health and Retirement Study 
(HRS). The HRS is an ongoing longitudinal study. Participants 
were interviewed every 2 years since 1992. A multi-stage sam-
pling strategy was performed. African Americans, Hispanics, 
and residents in Florida were oversampled. The HRS con-
tains rich data related to family, health, income, and retire-
ment among older adults and is suitable for answering various 
research questions. Details about the HRS can be found in the 
report by Heeringa and Connor.28 Because objective clinically 
evaluated balance and walking measures were first available in 
2006 in the HRS,29 we used all available data from wave 2006 
to 2014.
Measures
Any Fall
During the HRS interview, participants were asked “Have 
you fallen down since previous wave (or in the last 2 years)?” 
Response options were yes (1) or no (0).30,31
Extent of Insomnia symptoms
In the HRS, participants were asked how often they had trou-
ble with “falling asleep,” “waking up during the night,” and 
“waking up too early and not being able to fall asleep again.” 
They were also asked how often they felt “really rested when 
wake up in the morning.” The responses to these four questions 
were “most of the time,” “sometimes,” and “rarely or never.” 
Following the coding methods used in previous studies,32,33 four 
dummy variables were created. For the first three items, “Most 
of the time” and “sometimes” were coded as 1 (having these 
symptoms). For the fourth item, “sometimes” and “rarely or 
never” were coded as 1 so that 1 indicated not feeling rested in 
the morning. A composite score (0–4) for the number of insom-
nia symptoms was created. A higher score reflected a greater 
burden of insomnia symptoms.
Sleep Medications
The HRS asked participants whether they had taken any medi-
cations or used other treatment to help them sleep in the past 2 
weeks. If individuals reported that they had used sleep medica-
tions, they were further asked whether a doctor “recommended” 
the sleep medications or treatment. A categorical variable was 
created with three levels: no medications (reference group), 
nonphysician-recommended medications (or treatment), and 
physician-recommended medications (or treatment).
Covariates
Several known risk factors for falls were included as covari-
ates.1 For social-demographic characteristics, age and education 
were measured in years. Sex and race were dummy-coded with 
women and White coded as 1. Regarding the balance test,29,34 
participants were first asked to hold a semi-tandem stance for 
10 seconds. If participants successfully completed the semi-tan-
dem stance, they were asked to maintain a full-tandem stance 
for 30 seconds. If participants failed to complete the semi-tan-
dem stance, they were asked to hold a side-by-side stance for 
10 seconds. A categorical variable was created with four levels: 
complete full-tandem (reference group), complete semi-tan-
dem, complete side-by-side, and cannot complete side-by-side. 
A timed walking test29,34 was administered by asking partici-
pants to walk a 2.5-m course twice (go and back; 5 meters in 
total). The average time (in seconds) to complete the walking 
test was used in the analyses. Information about the self-rated 
vision was also included in this study. Participants were asked 
to rate their eyesight on a 5-point scale (1 = excellent, 2 = very 
good, 3 = good, 4 = fair, or 5 = poor) when using glasses or 
corrective lenses.
Study Design
Following the analytical strategy used by Himes and Reynolds,31 
we examined each interval between 2006 and 2014. The data 
were restructured such that respondents’ information in 2006, 
2008, 2010, and 2012 served as baseline and 2008, 2010, 
2012, and 2014 served as follow-up, respectively. This strat-
egy is effective to maximize the use of existing data, especially 
when studying a rare event, such as falls. The overview of our 
study design and exclusion flow diagram is shown in Figure 1. 
Among 152 740 total observations pooled across the four 
2-yr intervals, those who were younger than 65 years of age,

answered question by a proxy, did not live in community, and 
did not provide information on sleep, falls, and physical meas-
ures were excluded from the analyses. HRS documented the 
reasons for the missingness for physical measures (i.e., balance 
test and walking test). These reasons included respondents (or 
interviewers) thought the tests would not be safe, respondents 
refused, did not understand the instruction, could not stand due 
to surgery, injury or health condition, or there was no suita-
ble place for the tests. Additionally, the HRS only asked new 
participants (but not existing participants) in waves 2008 and 
2012 on three insomnia symptoms questions about “falling 
asleep,” “waking up during the night,” and “waking up too 
early and not being able to fall asleep again.” Thus, new par-
ticipants were able to provide responses on all the four items 
of insomnia symptoms, but existing participants were not. 
As this study focused on the total number of insomnia symp-
toms summing responses on all the four insomnia items, we 
had to exclude insomnia symptom observations in 2008 and 
2012 from existing participants. The final sample included 
6 882 observations (from 4 669 participants). This sample had 
an average age of 74.5 years (SD = 6.6) at baseline and was 
mostly White (85.7%) and women (57.4%; see overall column 
in Table 1), a similar demographic composition compared with 
national norms35 and previous studies.34
Statistical Analyses
Descriptive analyses were used to explore participants’ char-
acteristics based on falls status at baseline. Univariate logistic 
regression analyses were performed to assess the associations of 
the extent of insomnia symptoms, sleep medications, and covar-
iates at baseline with falls at follow-up.14,36 Significant variables 
related to falls in the univariate logistic regression model were 
then entered into a multivariate logistic regression model to 
examine the effects of the extent of insomnia symptoms at base-
line on falls at follow-up, first adjusting for sleep medications 
(Model 1) and then adjusting for significant covariates found 
in the univariate logistic regression analyses (Model 2). Next, 
the interaction effect between the extent of insomnia symptoms 
and sleep medications at baseline on the falls at follow-up was 
investigated. When modeling falls at follow-up, we controlled 
for falls at baseline to examine whether the extent of insomnia 
symptoms or sleep medications predicted changes in the likeli-
hood of falls during the given 2-years’ time period. The impact 
of each insomnia symptom on the falls was also assessed. The

sleep questions (i.e., “falling asleep,” “waking up during the night,” and “waking up too early and not being able to fall asleep again”). Using 
total number of insomnia symptoms from existing participants would underestimate the relationship between insomnia symptoms and falls. 
Therefore, baseline responses provided by existing participants in 2008 and 2012 were excluded.

results were displayed as odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence 
interval (95% CI). Data were analyzed with SPSS version 22.
RESULTS
At baseline, 32% of the participants fell at least once in the 
past 2 years, and at follow-up, 34% of participants reported at 
least one fall in the prior 2 years. Participants’ characteristics 
based on falls outcomes at baseline are displayed in Table 1. 
In general, older adults who fell reported a greater number of 
insomnia symptoms compared with those who did not fall. 
Additionally, a higher percentage of older adults who fell used 
nonphysician-recommended or physician-recommended sleep 
medications than those did not fall. Participants who fell were 
older and had poorer balance, walking speed, and vision than 
those who did not fall. The percentage of women and White 
participants were higher among those who reported at least 
one fall compared with those who did not report any fall. The 
correlation between variables can be found in supplementary 
table S1.
Table 2 shows the results from univariate logistic regression 
analyses examining the relationships between each predictor at 
baseline and any fall at follow-up. Significant factors at base-
line related to any fall at follow-up were the extent of insomnia 
symptoms, using physician-recommended sleep medications, 
age, sex, race, any fall, balance, walking speed, and vision. In 
the next set of analyses, we examined the effects of the extent 
of insomnia symptoms and sleep medications at baseline on any 
fall at follow-up adjusting for significant covariates found in the 
univariate analyses.
Independent Effects of the Extent of Insomnia Symptoms and 
Sleep Medications on Future Fall Risk
Table 3 shows the results from the multivariate logistic regres-
sion model predicting the likelihood of falling at follow-up. 
Model 1 showed that the extent of insomnia symptoms and 
using physician-recommended sleep medications at baseline 
were significant predictors of any fall at follow-up. That is, 
independent of sleep medications, experiencing a greater num-
ber of insomnia symptoms predicted higher odds of falling in 
the future. Moreover, compared with no sleep medications, 
using physician-recommended sleep medications increased 
the likelihood of falling independent of the extent of insomnia 
symptoms. Model 2 adjusted for age, any fall, balance, walk-
ing speed, and vision at baseline and sex and race. The effects 
of the extent of insomnia symptoms and using physician-rec-
ommended sleep medications at baseline remained significant. 
Specifically, older adults who reported one additional insomnia 
symptom at baseline were 5% more likely to fall at follow-up 
(H1 supported). Compared with older adults who did not use 
sleep medications, those who used physician-recommended 
sleep medications at baseline were approximately 34% more 
likely to report a fall at follow-up (H2 supported). There was 
no significant effect of using nonphysician-recommended sleep 
medications (vs. no medications) on any fall. We conducted 
supplementary analyses to see whether these associations dif-
fered by older adults’ physical performance (i.e., balance and 
walking speed). There were no significant interactions of the 
extent of insomnia symptoms or sleep medications with each 
of the physical performance measures (results are not shown,

but available upon request). Thus, the effects of the extent of 
insomnia symptoms and sleep medications on falls held across 
different levels of performance on balance and walking tests.
Moderating Effect of Physician-Recommended Sleep 
Medications On the Impact of the Extent of Insomnia Symptoms 
on Future Fall Risk
The results of the interactive effects showed that the impact of 
the extent of insomnia symptoms on future fall risk was signif-
icantly different for participants using physician-recommended 
sleep medications, compared with no medications. No significant 
difference was found for nonphysician-recommended sleep med-
ications (H3 supported). Figure 2 depicts the main effect of the 
extent of insomnia symptoms on fall risk (Figure 2, A), as well 
as the moderating effect of physician-recommended sleep med-
ications on the association of the extent of insomnia symptoms 
with risk of falling (Figure 2, B). As the main effect of the extent 
of insomnia symptoms indicated, the probability of falling at fol-
low-up was amplified with every additional insomnia symptom 
at baseline (Figure 2, A). However, such an effect was different 
between those using physician-recommended sleep medica-
tions and those who did not use sleep medications. The extent 
of insomnia symptoms exhibited a dose-response relation with 
falls in those who did not take any sleep medication (Figure 2, 
B). Compared with participants who did not take any sleep med-
ications, the probability of falling was consistently higher for all 
levels of insomnia symptoms among older adults who took phy-
sician-recommended sleep medications at baseline (Figure 2, B). 
Note that the moderating effect was found after adjusting for the 
effect of any fall at baseline and other covariates.
In sensitivity analyses, we tested whether each individual 
insomnia symptom predicted any fall, adjusting for sleep med-
ication and significant covariates (Table 4). Overall, endorsing 
each of the four items tended to increase the risk of falling, but 
only not feeling rested when waking up in the morning reached 
statistical significance.
DISCUSSION
This study examined the independent and interactive effects 
of the number of insomnia symptoms and sleep medications 
predicting fall risk among community-dwelling older adults. 
We found that experiencing a greater number of insomnia

symptoms and taking physician-recommended sleep medica-
tions each independently predicted the risk of falling 2 years 
later, adjusting for other known risk factors of falling (i.e., age, 
sex, race, and baseline falls, balance, walking speed, and vision). 
These independent effects of the extent of insomnia symptoms 
and sleep medications indicate that each explains unique var-
iance in the future risk of falling. The number of insomnia 
symptoms exhibited a significant dose-response relationship 
with future 2-year fall risk in older adults who did not use any 
sleep medication. In contrast, older adults who used physi-
cian-recommended sleep medications exhibited a consistently 
higher probability of falling at all levels of insomnia symptoms 
(from none to four symptoms). Our results suggest that treating 
insomnia while carefully selecting and closely monitoring the 
use of sleep medications may help reduce future falls in older 
adults. By testing the impact of multiple co-existing insomnia 
symptoms on future fall risk and the role of sleep medications, 
our study adds new knowledge on sleep and health in the pop-
ulation of older adults. The use of a nationally representative 
sample of community-dwelling older adults and a longitudinal 
design, and the statistical control of clinically evaluated physi-
cal performance and other known risk factors of falling increase 
the validity of our findings.

Our findings contribute to the literature by demonstrating that 
experiencing a greater burden of insomnia symptoms increases 
the probability of falling longitudinally. We estimated how the 
extent of insomnia symptoms at baseline predicted changes in 
Figure 2—Adjusted probability of falling at 2-year follow-up. The extent of insomnia symptoms was operationalized as a composite score 
of total number of insomnia symptoms (range = 0 – 4). (A) A dose–response relation between the extent of insomnia symptoms and risk of 
a future fall adjusted for age, sex, race, and baseline falls, and clinically evaluated physical performance (i.e., balance, walking speed, and 
vision). (B) Interactions between the extent of insomnia symptoms and physician-recommended sleep medications adjusted for the same 
variables as in (A) (B = −0.16, SE = 0.07, p < .05). Compared with older adults not using sleep medications, older adults who used physi-
cian-recommended medications did not exhibit different future fall risks by the level of insomnia symptoms.

Insomnia Symptoms Predicts Future Falls—Chen et al.
the likelihood of falling at follow-up by controlling for any fall 
at baseline, which gives higher confidence in interpreting the 
extent of insomnia symptoms as a predictor of having a fall 
in the future. Although the effect size of insomnia symptoms 
was not large compared with prior history of a fall, the effect 
was observed after controlling for prior experience of falls, the 
strongest predictor of future falls in many studies.1 That is, the 
extent of insomnia symptoms explained additional variance 
in future falls that prior falls did not explain. Furthermore, 
we adjusted for the effects of sociodemographic characteris-
tics and objective physical performance (balance and walking 
speed) and thus corroborate the unique prediction of the extent 
of insomnia symptoms beyond other known risk factors of 
future falls.
Building on previous work that tested the association of sin-
gle insomnia symptom with falls,19,20 this study examined the 
extent of insomnia symptoms (i.e., the total number of insom-
nia symptoms) that can capture co-existing insomnia symp-
toms prevalent in the elderly.7 Multiple insomnia complaints 
are common among older adults,7 and our findings suggest that 
investigating a single insomnia symptom may underestimate 
the impact of multiple co-existing insomnia symptoms on fall 
risk (Table 4). It is possible that older adults with a greater 
number of insomnia symptoms are not well rested and expe-
rience greater tiredness and drowsiness compared with those 
with no or fewer insomnia symptoms. Subsequently, they may 
fall because of slower reaction to correct their balance while 
standing or walking.10,12,13 Unfortunately, other sleep variables 
or problems such as sleep hours, daytime sleepiness, daily nap-
ping, and sleep apnea are not available in the HRS, a limita-
tion of the current analysis. Future studies could investigate 
whether and how other sleep characteristics and co-existing 
sleep problems contribute to the relationship between the 
extent of insomnia symptoms and falls.
Use of Physician-Recommended Sleep Medications Moderates 
the Effects of the Extent of Insomnia Symptoms on Future 
Fall Risk
Thus far, few studies have reported how sleep medication 
use impacts the relationship between insomnia symptoms 
and falls. Our findings revealed both main effects and mod-
erating effects of sleep medications. With regard to its main 
effect, at all levels of insomnia symptoms (from none to four 
symptoms), taking physician-recommended sleep medica-
tions at baseline was associated with a greater fall risk rel-
ative to not taking any sleep medication. However, the role 
of physician-recommended sleep medications differed in the 
relationship between the extent of insomnia symptoms and 
falls. Older adults who did not use any sleep medication 
exhibited increased probability of falling with the increase 
in every number of insomnia symptoms; for older adults who 
used physician-recommended sleep medications, a consist-
ent elevated risk of falling was observed across all levels of 
insomnia symptoms. Our findings suggest that using physi-
cian-recommended sleep medications can impose additional 
risk of falling above and beyond insomnia symptoms burden. 
Physician-recommended sleep medications may cause side 
effects (e.g., ataxia or residual sedation) that can affect older 
adults’ balance.23,24 Alternatively, older adults using physi-
cian-recommended sleep medication may have some greater 
insomnia symptom burden that is not captured by the simple 
symptom self-report. Note that using sleep medications that 
were not recommended by doctors did not seem to predict 
falling or moderate the effect of the extent of insomnia symp-
toms on any fall. Future research should examine the specific 
kinds of nonphysician-recommended sleep medications the 
older adults commonly use and track the side effects of those 
medications, especially for falls and other future health risks.
Practical Implications
Sleep problems are not necessarily a part of normal aging,37 but they 
are more common among older adults and often undertreated.7,38 
Insomnia is related to a poorer health status39 and may aggravate 
the underlying health conditions,40 which can subsequently lead to 
a higher rate of hospitalization32 and medications use.33
Previous research has contributed to our understanding of 
several nonmodifiable and modifiable risk factors of falls.2–4 For 
example, a history of falling, age, and gender are nonmodifiable 
markers. To prevent falls, the best strategy is to reduce modifi-
able risk factors.1 Given that insomnia symptoms and the use 
of sleep medications are significant predictors of falls and can 
be successfully managed,41–43 targeting these two factors may 
subsequently reduce the probability of falling.
Of clinical concern, older adults have an increased risk of fall-
ing, within a 2-year follow-up period, directly proportional to their 
self-reported extent of insomnia symptoms controlling for clin-
ical evaluations of fall risk such as gait and walking speed. Falls 
occurred at high rates in older adults taking physician-recom-
mended sleep medication. It is, therefore, important for clinicians 
to screen older adults for the presence of insomnia and make a 
referral to a specialist in sleep disorders if needed. Clinicians are 
recommended to prefer cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia

Insomnia Symptoms Predicts Future Falls—Chen et al.
(CBT
-I) as the initial treatment in cognitively competent older 
adults.41 CBT
-I has been found to be effective in treating insom-
nia among older adults and in sustaining the effects longer com-
pared with sleep medications or other treatments (e.g., Tai Chi 
exercise)42,43 with potentially fewer side effects for falls. If CBT-I 
is unsuccessful, clinicians are then recommended to discuss with 
the patients the benefits and risks of short-term use of pharmaco-
logical therapy before prescribing sleep medications.41
It is also worthy to note that, in our study, there were indi-
viduals who reported no insomnia symptoms, but used phy-
sician-recommended (n = 44) or nonphysician-recommended 
(n = 33) sleep medications. This situation was also found in a 
previous cross-sectional study.18 Such an observation suggests 
that older adults may have used sleep medications to relieve 
their insomnia symptoms and continue to use the medications 
even after their insomnia symptoms have resolved. This is 
important because our findings showed that older adults who 
used physician-recommended sleep medications appeared to 
have a higher probability of falling compared with those who 
did not use sleep medications, regardless of the extent of insom-
nia symptoms endorsed (Figure 2, B). In the previous study, the 
researchers also found associations of single falls and injurious 
falls with individuals who did not have any insomnia symp-
toms but used sleep medications.18 A better medications review 
and planned medications withdrawal may help reduce falls.44
Limitations and Future Directions
There are limitations in this current study. First, there may be 
recall bias because older adults retrospectively reported about 
falls happened in the last 2 years. The circumstances of falls were 
not collected in the HRS; we would, otherwise, be able to examine 
whether, for example, older adults fell during nocturnal walking 
or fell because of cognitive impairment. Future research is also 
recommended to examine the impact of the extent of insomnia 
symptoms on recurrent falls. Researchers have noted that recur-
rent falls are likely to be due to intrinsic risks (e.g., poor balance), 
rather than extrinsic risks (e.g., environment).30,36,45 Experiencing 
a greater burden of insomnia symptoms may relate to intrinsic 
risks of older adults10 and hence may predict recurrent falls. 
Second, the HRS asked the frequency of each insomnia symp-
tom that participants habitually experienced, but did not specify a 
time frame (e.g., in the past 6 months). It is possible that individ-
uals may interpret the questions differently. Future studies should 
specify the time frame in the questionnaires. Third, the HRS asked 
whether individuals used sleep medications in the past 2 weeks. 
We, therefore, are unable to know whether individuals have used 
sleep medications for a longer period of time. Moreover, the 
use of retrospective survey data may involve recall bias or bias 
in interpreting correctly the meaning of a “sleep medication.”46 
Furthermore, information on specific sleep medications was not 
available in the HRS which instead simply delineated whether 
recommended by a physician. Future research may benefit from 
incorporating more specific or valid information via a sleep med-
ications diary, or electronic health records, to fully understand the 
effects of sleep medications on falls among older adults.
CONCLUSIONS
Findings from the current study provide strong evidence that 
the extent of insomnia symptoms (i.e., experiencing multiple 
co-existing insomnia symptoms) and the use of physician-recom-
mended sleep medications independently predict increased risk of 
future falls among community-dwelling older adults. Moreover, 
using physician-recommended sleep medications can impose 
extra risk of falling above and beyond the extent of insomnia 
symptoms. Future work will need to further clarify the specific 
sleep medications contributing to the risk of falls, as well as risk 
evaluation strategies, to prevent and reduce falls in older adults—a 
population that their healthy functioning is our best interests.
