ABSTRACT
Objective Previous meta-analyses have found that
exercise prevents falls in older people. This study aimed
to test whether this effect is still present when new trials
are added, and it explores whether characteristics of the
trial design, sample or intervention are associated with
greater fall prevention effects.
Design Update of a systematic review with random
effects meta-analysis and meta-regression.
Data sources Cochrane Library, CINAHL, MEDLINE,
EMBASE, PubMed, PEDro and SafetyLit were searched
from January 2010 to January 2016.
Study eligibility criteria We included randomised
controlled trials that compared fall rates in older people
randomised to receive exercise as a single intervention
with fall rates in those randomised to a control group.
Results 99 comparisons from 88 trials with 19 478
participants were available for meta-analysis. Overall,
exercise reduced the rate of falls in community-dwelling
older people by 21% (pooled rate ratio 0.79, 95% CI
0.73 to 0.85, p<0.001, I2 47%, 69 comparisons) with
greater effects seen from exercise programmes that
challenged balance and involved more than 3 hours/
week of exercise. These variables explained 76% of the
between-trial heterogeneity and in combination led to a
39% reduction in falls (incident rate ratio 0.61, 95% CI
0.53 to 0.72, p<0.001). Exercise also had a fall
prevention effect in community-dwelling people with
Parkinson’s disease (pooled rate ratio 0.47, 95% CI
0.30 to 0.73, p=0.001, I2 65%, 6 comparisons) or
cognitive impairment (pooled rate ratio 0.55, 95% CI
0.37 to 0.83, p=0.004, I2 21%, 3 comparisons). There
was no evidence of a fall prevention effect of exercise in
residential care settings or among stroke survivors or
people recently discharged from hospital.
Summary/conclusions Exercise as a single
intervention can prevent falls in community-dwelling
older people. Exercise programmes that challenge
balance and are of a higher dose have larger effects.
The impact of exercise as a single intervention in clinical
groups and aged care facility residents requires further
investigation, but promising results are evident for
people with Parkinson’s disease and cognitive
impairment.
INTRODUCTION
Falls are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality
in older adults.1
2 Approximately one in three
community-dwelling people aged 65 years or older
will fall at least once per year,3 and the risk of
falling increases with age.2 Falls impose a signifi-
cant social and economic burden for individuals,
their families, community health services and the
economy. As the proportion of older people is
rising globally, the costs associated with falls will
increase.4 The prevention of falls is therefore an
urgent public health challenge. National health
bodies and international guidelines are promoting
the implementation of appropriately designed inter-
vention programmes that are known to prevent
falls in older people.5 6
There
is
strong
evidence
that
appropriately
designed intervention programmes can prevent falls
in older people.7–9 A Cochrane systematic review7
established that exercise interventions reduce the
rate of falls (number of falls per person) and risk of
falling (proportion of people having one or more
falls)
in
community-dwelling
older
people.
Furthermore, exercise as a single intervention has a
fall prevention effect similar to multifaceted inter-
ventions,7 10 suggesting implementation of exercise
as a stand-alone intervention may be the optimal
and potentially most cost-effective11 approach to
fall prevention at a population level.
Trials of exercise for fall prevention are heteroge-
neous in risk of bias, populations involved and
content of exercise programmes. Meta-regression
enables investigation of between-trial variability,
that is, whether certain trial-level factors are asso-
ciated with greater effects of intervention pro-
grammes.12
Our
previous
meta-analyses
with
meta-regression, which included 44 trials in 20088
and 54 trials in 2011,9 found greater fall preven-
tion effects in trials where exercise programmes
included balance training, were undertaken more
frequently (ie, exceeded 2 hours a week over the
study period) and did not include walking exercise.
Recent publication of additional trials necessitates
an
update
of
the
previous
systematic
review,
meta-analyses and meta-regression. This systematic
review and meta-analysis aimed to: (1) determine the
effects of exercise on fall rates in older people when
compared with no exercise in randomised controlled
trials (RCTs), and (2) explore whether characteristics
of the trial design, sample or intervention are asso-
ciated with greater fall prevention effects.
METHODS
This systematic review was conducted in accord-
ance with the PRISMA guidelines and the checklist
was completed.13

 evaluated was exercise and the outcome was the number of falls,
rate of falls or number of fallers were considered for inclusion.
Only trials that reported the number or rate of falls were com-
bined in the meta-analyses. T
rials were ineligible if non-exercise
interventions were a major (>25% of time) component of the
intervention being evaluated or if the control group received
exercise, unless the control group’s exercise appeared to be of
insufficient intensity (ie, upper limb or stretching exercise only,
or authors stated there was no challenge to balance), dose
(ie,
less
than
four
supervised
sessions)
and
progression
(ie, authors stated exercises were not progressed in terms of
intensity or challenge to balance) to have beneficial effects on
balance or mobility.
Search strategy
This review is an update of our two previously published sys-
tematic reviews.8
9 Seven electronic databases were searched
(Cochrane Library, CINAHL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed,
PEDro and SafetyLit) from 1 January 2010 to 22 January 2016.
The search strategy consisted of terms describing the popula-
tion, outcome and study type as shown in online supplementary
file S1. The reference lists of included studies, relevant protocol
papers and systematic reviews were screened and forward cit-
ation tracking was conducted to identify studies missed by the
database search.
Review process
T
o determine eligibility of identified trial reports, two of the fol-
lowing five contributors (ZAM, SSP
, NF, CS, Claire Mok) inde-
pendently screened titles and abstracts. Full texts were obtained
where necessary. Differences of opinion between authors about
study eligibility were resolved by discussion and adjudicated by
the lead author (CS) as required.
Risk of bias
Risk of bias was assessed using the PEDro scale.14 When avail-
able, the PEDro rating and score was obtained from the PEDro
database.15 In all other instances, two authors independently
rated risk of bias. Differences were resolved by discussion and
adjudicated by the lead author (CS) as required.
Study analysis
T
wo of the following five contributors (ZAM, SSP
, NF, JW
,
Angie Baba) extracted data on study design, sample character-
istics, intervention design and estimates of effect of exercise
from each study. The studies were described in terms of trial
design (sample size, follow-up period, PEDro score), sample
characteristics (dwelling type, clinical condition, age, control
group fall rate, falls risk status), intervention components
(strength training, balance training, endurance training, flexibil-
ity exercise, walking training or practice, amount of supervision,

 exercises tailored in type or intensity, dose of exercise) and
adherence to programme. Some characteristics were coded on
3- to 5-point scales, and were dichotomised for the analysis as
shown in table 1.
Estimates of the effect of exercise on the rate of falls were
extracted from each trial. Where possible, estimates of incident
rate ratios (IRRs) from negative binomial regression models or
HRs from proportional hazards models that allowed for mul-
tiple falls per person were used. Alternatively, data on the total
number of falls per group or number of falls per person and
exposure
times
(person-years
of
follow-up
using
actual
follow-up times and number of participants providing data
where reported) were used to calculate rate ratios. Where pos-
sible, unadjusted fall rates and longer follow-up times were used
(eg, in an article which presented 6-month and 12-month fall
data, the 12-month data were used) except where the long-term
fall rates reported were more than 1 year after completion of
the intervention. For trials with more than one exercise inter-
vention group, separate estimates of the effects of each exercise
intervention were calculated. To avoid ‘double counting’ of
control participants from these trials, the total falls and partici-
pant numbers in the control group were allocated in proportion
to the participant numbers in each intervention group. For trials
that were cluster randomised but did not account for the effect
of clustering, the variance of estimates was adjusted by assuming
an intracluster correlation of 0.01.
Random effects meta-analysis was undertaken using user-
written commands in Stata V
.13 software (Stata Corp, College
Station, T
exas, USA). Pooled analyses were undertaken for (1)
trials in general older community-dwelling populations and (2)
trials
conducted
in
residential
care
settings.
Separate
meta-analyses were undertaken for trials conducted in people
with Parkinson’s disease, stroke, cognitive impairment and
people recently discharged from hospital. The pooled rate ratio
was calculated and between-trial heterogeneity was determined
by visual inspection of the forest plots and with consideration
of the I2 statistic. The pooled effect was calculated using the
‘metan’ command.16 Egger’s test and visual inspection of funnel
plots were undertaken to assess small study effects. Sensitivity
analyses were conducted to assess the effects of exercise on falls
using fixed-effect meta-analysis and excluding in turn: smaller
trials (samples sizes of <200 at randomisation); trials with a
higher risk of bias (PEDro Scale score <7); trials for which the
ratio comparing fall rates between groups was calculated by the
review authors using the number of falls or rate of falls by
group; and cluster randomised trials. Given the few studies in
people with particular clinical conditions, sensitivity analyses for
these meta-analyses were only undertaken excluding trials with
a higher risk of bias (PEDro Scale score <7).
Meta-regression was undertaken using the user-written Stata
command ‘metareg’17 to explore the impact of trial-level
characteristics relating to trial design (sample size, follow-up
period,

score),

 RESULTS
The electronic search retrieved 10 776 articles (figure 1). After
screening, 112 eligible RCTs were identified of which 88 trials
provided data of the number of falls in each group so were
included in the meta-analysis. Characteristics of the trials are
shown in online supplementary file S2 and summarised in table 1.
Nine of the 88 trials included 2 exercise groups and 1 control
group. One trial had 3 exercise groups and 1 control group, so
99 comparisons were available for meta-analysis. The included
trials involved a total of 19 478 participants. Most trials were
conducted in people living in the general community (61 trials,
69 comparisons); 10 trials (10 comparisons) were conducted in
high-care residential facilities (nursing homes) and 4 trials
(5 comparisons) were conducted in low-care residential facilities
(hostels). T
wo trials18
19 were conducted predominantly in
retirement
villages
or aged-care
communities
where
older
people cared for themselves, so these trials were included with
general community analyses. Thirteen trials (15 comparisons)

 included only community-dwelling participants with a clinical
condition likely to increase the risk of falls (eg, Parkinson’s
disease, stroke, impaired cognition) or a specific recruitment
method likely to indicate a high-risk population (recent dis-
charge from hospital). Around half of the exercise programmes
evaluated in the trials tailored the intensity or type of exercise
to the individual (n=51) and were conducted under supervision
of an instructor, with <10 participants per instructor (n=44).
Effects of exercise on fall rates
The pooled effect of exercise on fall rates in community-
dwelling older people, expressed as a rate ratio, was 0.79 (95%
CI 0.73 to 0.85, p<0.001, I2 47%, 69 comparisons, figure 2)
and in residential care settings was 0.90 (95% CI 0.72 to 1.12,
p=0.35, I2 68%, 15 comparisons, figure 3). The pooled esti-
mate of the effect of exercise on falls in community-dwelling
older people remained similar in all sensitivity analyses, but het-
erogeneity (I2) was decreased to 30% when only studies with a
lower risk of bias (PEDro score ≥7) were included (table 2). The
pooled estimate of the effect of exercise on falls in residential
care settings was more variable in the sensitivity analysis, reflect-
ing greater uncertainty about the effectiveness of exercise on
falls in this population (table 2).
The pooled effect of exercise was 0.47 in people with
Parkinson’s disease (95% CI 0.30 to 0.73, p=0.001, I2 65%, 6
comparisons); 0.74 in people after stroke (95% CI 0.42 to 1.32,
p=0.31, I2 39%, 3 comparisons); 0.55 in people with cognitive
impairment (95% CI 0.37 to 0.83, p=0.004, I2 21%, 3 compari-
sons) and 1.16 in people recently discharged from hospital (95%
CI 0.88 to 1.52, p=0.30, I2 47%, 3 comparisons) (figure 4).
These estimates were essentially unchanged when only trials with
a lower risk of bias (PEDro score ≥7) were included (table 2).
Exploration of impact of trial characteristics on the effect of
exercise on falls
In
community-dwelling
older
people,
greater
intervention
effects were seen in trials that included exercise programmes
that aimed to provide a high challenge to balance (the ratio of
rate ratios (RRR) obtained from the meta-regression was 0.85
(95% CI 0.73 to 0.995, p=0.04, 28% of heterogeneity
explained)) and 3 or more hours per week of prescribed exercise
over the programme period (RRR 0.77, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.91,
p=0.003,
61%
of
heterogeneity
explained;
table
3).
Multivariable meta-regression analysis found these factors to be
independently associated with greater fall prevention effects and
when combined, explained 76% of between-study heterogeneity
(table 4). The modelled effect on falls of exercise programmes
with neither of these variables was 0.90 (95% CI 0.82 to 0.99,
p=0.03) and with both of these variables was 0.61 (95% CI
0.53 to 0.72, p<0.001).
Exploration of small study effects
Visual inspection of the funnel plots (figure 5) suggested some
asymmetry and thus a possibility of small study effects in the
analyses of studies undertaken in community-dwellers, in resi-
dential care and in people with Parkinson’s disease. W
e consid-
ered there to be too few studies in other clinical groups to
enable exploration of small study effects. Egger’s test found evi-
dence of small study effects in community-dwellers (p=0.02)
but not the other analyses (residential care p=0.09, Parkinson’s
disease p=0.19). These last two analyses may be underpowered,
given the small numbers of studies involved.
DISCUSSION
This systematic review with meta-analysis provides strong evidence
that exercise as a single intervention prevents falls in older people
living in the community
. The meta-regression suggests pro-
grammes that involve a high challenge to balance and include
more than 3 hours/week of exercise have greater fall prevention

 effects. The pooling of results from 62 trials across a range of
countries suggests the results can be broadly generalised to
community-dwelling older people, although it is acknowledged
that
few
studies
were
undertaken
in
low-income
and
middle-income countries. Fewer studies have been undertaken in
residential care settings and in people with particular clinical con-
ditions, so there is less certainty about the impact of exercise as a
single intervention in these groups. There is currently no evidence
that exercise as a single intervention can prevent falls in residential
care settings, among stroke survivors or among people recently
discharged from hospital. There was evidence of a fall prevention
effect in community-dwelling people with Parkinson’s disease and
people with cognitive impairment, but this needs to be confirmed
with further studies. Our updated recommendations for fall pre-
vention practice are shown in box 1.

taken to explore characteristics of more effective interventions.
The number of trials has doubled since our previous update, so
this is no longer necessary. The large number of trials now
enables separate analysis by setting and condition. Given the
likely heterogeneity between people living in different settings
and with different health conditions, separate analysis by setting
is clinically justifiable. Similarly, we previously combined studies
that reported the effect of exercise on the proportion of fallers
in intervention versus control groups with studies that reported
effects on number of falls. However, as interventions may have
different impacts on the proportion of fallers and the number of
falls this approach is not ideal and is no longer necessary due to
the additional studies now available for analysis.
T
wo-thirds (76%) of the between-trial heterogeneity (I2 47%)
in the community-dwelling older people could be explained by
the presence of two exercise programme characteristics: a high
challenge to balance and more than 3 hours/week of exercise.
Exercise programmes that contained these components reduced
the rate of falls by 39%. This is consistent with the results of
our previous review,9 but in the current review, a higher dose of
exercise and higher challenge to balance differentiated more

 effective and less effective trials. This information can be used
in the design of future fall prevention programmes. A safe chal-
lenge to balance can be delivered in diverse ways by home exer-
cise, group exercise and Tai Chi.7 In situations with resource
constraints, group exercise programmes may need to be supple-
mented with home exercise to achieve a higher dose of overall
exercise. It is important to note that the exercise programmes
tested in the included trials were mostly individually prescribed
by trained health or exercise professionals to minimise the risk
of harm (including falls) while exercising. Indeed when imple-
menting fall prevention interventions, one should consider
characteristics of successful interventions in addition to features
that differentiate successful from less successful interventions.
Unlike the previous versions of this review,8 9 the presence of
a walking programme was not associated with a reduction in
intervention effectiveness. A recent trial20 evaluating the effect-
iveness of a walking programme supported by telephone coach-
ing found that this programme did not prevent falls. Taken
together with an earlier trial21 in which the risk of falls was
increased
from
a
brisk
walking
programme,
and
the
meta-regression findings, we suggest walking should not be pre-
scribed as a single fall prevention intervention and high-risk
older people should not be told to walk briskly. However, given
the popularity of walking,22 its other health benefits and the
inclusion of individually prescribed walking in some successful
interventions (such as the Otago Home Exercise Programme),23
we suggest that walking programmes may be carefully prescribed
to older people in addition to other fall prevention exercises.
The lack of a fall prevention effect from exercise as a single
intervention in residential care settings is consistent with the
results of the Cochrane systematic review of fall prevention in
aged care facilities.24 The more dependent population in aged
care facilities may require additional interventions targeting mul-
tiple health conditions and impairments. This does not mean

Box 1
Updated recommendations for fall prevention
practice in community-dwelling older people
1. Exercise programmes should aim to provide a high challenge
to balance. Choose exercises that involve safely:
A. reducing the base of support (eg, standing with two legs
close together, standing with one foot directly in front of
the other, standing on one leg);
B. moving the centre of gravity and controlling body position
while standing (eg, reaching, transferring body weight from
one leg to another, stepping up onto a higher surface);
and
C. standing without using the arms for support, or if this is
not possible then aim to reduce reliance on the upper
limbs (eg, hold onto a surface with one hand rather than
two, or one finger instead of the whole hand)
2. At least 3 hours of exercise should be undertaken each week
3. Ongoing participation in exercise is necessary or benefits will
be lost
4. Fall prevention exercise should be targeted at the general
community as well as community-dwellers with an increased
risk of falls
5. Fall prevention exercise may be undertaken in a group or
home-based setting
6. Walking training may be included in addition to balance
training but high-risk individuals should not be prescribed
brisk walking programmes
7. Strength training may be included in addition to balance
training
8. Exercise providers should make referrals for other risk factors
to be addressed
9. Exercise as a single intervention may prevent falls in people
with Parkinson’s disease or cognitive impairment. There is
currently no evidence that exercise as a single intervention
prevents falls in stroke survivors or people recently discharged
from hospital. Exercise should be delivered to these groups by
providers with particular expertise.

 there is no role for exercise as a component of a fall prevention
programme in residential care. Several individual trials that have
found fall prevention effects in residential care settings have
included exercise as a key component of the intervention, but
have also included other strategies, including education of staff
and attention to the environment.25 More work is required to
establish the optimal fall prevention approach in residential care,
but exercise as a single intervention cannot be recommended as a
fall prevention strategy at present. There are other benefits of
maintaining function in this population such as enhanced quality
of life, decreased care needs and fewer complications such as
chest infections and pressure injuries and appropriately designed
exercise programmes may be able to achieve this.
There have been relatively few trials of fall prevention strat-
egies in people with particular clinical conditions or fall risk
factors. W
e found promising results for the prevention of falls
with exercise as single intervention in people with cognitive
impairment and Parkinson’s disease, but more trials are required
in these groups. While we did not find evidence of fall preven-
tion effects of exercise as a single intervention in people recently
discharged from hospital, there is evidence that home safety
interventions can prevent falls in this groups.7 It is not yet
known how to prevent falls in stroke survivors.26 As exercise
has been found to have other benefits for these groups, includ-
ing improved mobility,27 28 future trials could investigate the
combination of exercise and other fall prevention interventions.
This systematic review has some limitations. In particular, the
meta-regression should be interpreted with caution as the
‘effects’ estimated with meta-regression are based on non-
randomised comparisons between studies, so they are potentially
confounded.12 Individual participant data meta-analysis may
better enable investigation of the impact of sample character-
istics such as age and fall risk status on intervention effective-
ness. Coding of the exercise programme components was
undertaken on the information available in the published papers
and therefore, there is the potential for inaccurate interpret-
ation.
Confidence
in
the
results
of
the
meta-analysis
in
community-dwellers is increased by the stability of the estimates
of effect when fixed-effects meta-analysis and sensitivity analyses
were undertaken. Although the funnel plot asymmetry and
Eggers’ test suggest this analysis may be affected by small study
effects, this was not supported by the results of the sensitivity
analysis when the smaller studies were excluded or by the lack
of a significant effect of sample size on effect size in the
meta-regression. However, the risk of small study effects in the
residential
care
settings
and
in
community-dwellers
with
Parkinson’s disease will require further exploration when more
trials become available.
In conclusion, this updated review confirms that exercise as a
single intervention can prevent falls in community-dwelling
older people. Programmes that challenge balance and are of a
higher dose have larger effects. The impact of exercise as a
single intervention in other clinical groups and aged care facility
residents requires further investigation. Promising results have
been obtained in people with Parkinson’s disease and cognitive
impairment.
