Pathophysiological mechanisms in human airway smooth muscle cells (HASMCs)
significantly contribute to the progression of chronic inflammatory airway diseases with
limited therapeutic options, such as severe asthma and COPD. These abnormalities
include the contractility and hyperproduction of inflammatory proteins. To develop
therapeutic strategies, key pathological mechanisms, and putative clinical targets need
to be identified. In the present study, we demonstrated that the human olfactory
receptors (ORs) OR1D2 and OR2AG1 are expressed at the RNA and protein levels in
HASMCs. Using fluorometric calcium imaging, specific agonists for OR2AG1 and OR1D2
were identified to trigger transient Ca2+ increases in HASMCs via a cAMP-dependent
signal transduction cascade. Furthermore, the activation of OR2AG1 via amyl butyrate
inhibited the histamine-induced contraction of HASMCs, whereas the stimulation of
OR1D2 with bourgeonal led to an increase in cell contractility. In addition, OR1D2
activation induced the secretion of IL-8 and GM-CSF. Both effects were inhibited by the
specific OR1D2 antagonist undecanal. We herein provide the first evidence to show that
ORs are functionally expressed in HASMCs and regulate pathophysiological processes.
Therefore, ORs might be new therapeutic targets for these diseases, and blocking ORs
could be an auspicious strategy for the treatment of early-stage chronic inflammatory
lung diseases.

INTRODUCTION
Olfactory receptors (ORs) represent the largest supergene family within the class of G protein-
coupled receptors (GPCRs). They detect volatile odorant molecules by specific binding. Originally,
olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) within the olfactory epithelium (OE) were thought to exclusively
express ORs (Buck and Axel, 1991). However, emerging data demonstrate that OR expression is
not restricted to the OE but can be found in various human tissues (Feldmesser et al., 2006; Flegel
et al., 2013). In the last decade, ORs were shown to regulate essential physiological functions, such

as the regeneration of keratinocytes (Busse et al., 2014), sperm
motility (Spehr et al., 2003), and the inhibition of prostate cancer
(Neuhaus et al., 2009) and hepatocarcinoma (Maßberg et al.,
2015) cell proliferation.
Canonical
olfactory
signaling
is
initialized
by
a
conformational change of the OR after odorant binding.
A heterotrimeric G protein (Golf) is activated (Jones and
Reed, 1989; Belluscio et al., 1998), stimulating an adenylyl
cyclase III (ACIII), which in turn generates cyclic adenosine
monophosphate (cAMP; Bakalyar and Reed, 1990). This process
leads to an opening of cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channels,
which conduct Ca2+ ions to the intracellular space, resulting
in a depolarization of the OSN (Dhallan et al., 1990; Bradley
et al., 1994). In non-chemosensory tissues, parts of this canonical
pathway have been identified, but alternative signal transduction
components have also been described (Spehr et al., 2011; Busse
et al., 2014; Maßberg et al., 2015).
Abnormalities in human airway smooth muscle cell (HASMC)
function and structure play critical roles in chronic inflammatory
airway diseases, such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease (COPD), and cystic fibrosis. One key feature in the
pathophysiology of these diseases is the increase in airway lumen
narrowing, which is caused by an increase in the mass of airway
smooth muscles due to the hyperplasia and/or hypertrophy of
HASMCs (Kim et al., 2008; Berair et al., 2013; Hirota and Martin,
2013; Sohal et al., 2013). Moreover, HASMCs secrete chemokines,
cytokines, and growth factors in an inflammatory environment,
thereby promoting the activation and migration of inflammatory
cells, which consequently lead to airway and vascular remodeling
(Knobloch et al., 2013). Additionally, the HASMCs of asthmatics
often show hypercontractility. The contractility of these cells
strongly depends on increases in the intracellular Ca2+ levels. To
date, this Ca2+ increase has been attributed to the activation of
a GPCR that initializes a phospholipase C-dependent pathway,
leading to the release of Ca2+ ions from the intracellular
sarcoplasmic reticulum stores via inositol triphosphate receptors
(Sims et al., 1996; White et al., 2003). Taken together, the
identification of mechanisms that affect the pathophysiological
changes in HASMCs in patients with chronic inflammatory
airway diseases are of eminent interest for the development of
new clinical and therapeutic approaches. Because ORs regulate
important physiological effects in several non-olfactory tissues
and control the intracellular Ca2+ levels, we hypothesized that
they might influence HASMC contractility and the secretion of
inflammatory cytokines by HASMCs.
We demonstrated that different ORs are expressed at the
mRNA and protein levels in HASMCs. In response to binding
to specific ligands, they trigger intracellular Ca2+ increase
via a cAMP-dependent pathway. Furthermore, OR activation
specifically modulated HASMC contractility and the secretion of
cytokines that are involved in airway inflammation in asthma,
COPD, and other chronic lung diseases.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
HASMC Isolation
HASMCs were dissected from lobar or main bronchus tissue
obtained from patients undergoing lung resection for carcinoma
of the bronchus, as described previously (Knobloch et al., 2009,
2013, 2014). Healthy tumor-free tissue was used for HASMC
isolation. Briefly, the bronchial rings from the edges of the
resected tissues that were tumor-free were placed in sterile
Hank’s buffered salt solution (HBSS; Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis,
MO, USA, cat#-T-4674). Under sterile conditions, the smooth
muscle layer was freed of adherent connective tissue: the smooth
muscle was separated from the cartilage, and the epithelial layer
and was cut into 1–3 mm2 pieces with a sterile scalpel blade.
These tissue pieces were incubated in HBSS containing 10 mg/ml
bovine serum albumin (BSA) and the enzymes collagenase (type
XI, 1 mg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich cat#-C9407) and elastase (type I,
3.3 U/ml; Sigma-Aldrich cat#-E7885) for 30 min at 37◦C in 5%
CO2. After further removing the remaining connective tissue, the
pieces were incubated in the aforementioned enzyme solution
for 90–150 min, but the elastase content was increased to 15
U/ml. To separate the dispersed cells from the enzyme solution,
the solutions were centrifuged (100 g, 5 min) at 4◦C and then
resuspended in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM;
Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany, cat#-31885-023) containing
10% FCS (Sigma-Aldrich; cat#-N-4637), sodium pyruvate (1
mM; Invitrogen cat#-11360-039), L-glutamine (2 mM; Sigma-
Aldrich cat#-G-7513), non-essential amino acids (1%; Invitrogen
cat#-11140-035), penicillin (100 U/ml), streptomycin (100
µg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich cat#-P-4333), and amphotericin B (1.5
µg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich cat#-A-2942). This study was approved
by the ethics committee of the University of Bochum (4257-12),
Germany, and all donors gave their written consent.
HASMC Characterization and Cultivation
HASMCs were characterized and cultivated as described
previously (Knobloch et al., 2009, 2013, 2014). Briefly, the
HASMC cellular suspension was placed in a tissue culture flask
(25 cm2) with 8 ml of DMEM (supplemented as described
above) and incubated at 37◦C in 5% CO2. The culture medium
was replaced after the initial 4–5 days and every 2–3 days
thereafter. After 2–4 weeks, the cells reached confluence.
Confluent cells were split 1:5 with trypsin (1% in HBSS) and
further cultivated in 75 cm2 tissue culture flasks with 15 ml
DMEM plus supplements. The HASMCs were characterized by
positive immunostaining for calponin, smooth muscle α-actin,
and myosin heavy chain (Knobloch et al., 2009, 2013, 2014). The
cells were counted with a Neubauer haemocytometer; the cell
viability was assessed by Trypan blue exclusion and was found
to exceed 95%.
HASMC Count
Five thousand cells were seeded in wells of a 48-well-plate
and serum-deprived for 16 h as described previously (Knobloch
et al., 2013). The cells were then incubated with odorants
or recombinant epidermal growth factor (EGF, R&D Systems,
cat.: 236-EG; positive control) in low-glucose (1 g/l) DMEM
supplemented with 1% FCS, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 2
mM L-glutamine, 1% non-essential amino acids, 100 U/ml
penicillin, 100 µg/ml streptomycin, and 1.5 µg/ml amphotericin
B for 6 days. After incubation, the cells were stained with
Trypan blue and counted in a Neubauer counting chamber
as described before (Knobloch et al., 2008). The total number

according
to
the
manufacturer’s instructions. RNA concentration and quality
(A260/A280 ratio) were analyzed using Spectrophotometer
NanoDrop ND-1000 (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).
After DNase I treatment with the TURBO DNA-free
TM Kit
(Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), complementary DNA
(cDNA) was synthesized using the iScript

Kit (Bio-Rad, Berkeley, CA, USA). For RT-PCR experiments,
we used RNA controls (−RT) to exclude contamination with
genomic DNA. RT-PCR was performed using GoTaq R

Master Mix (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) in a volume of 20 µl
with 10 pmols of each primer. The following temperature cycle
profile was used: 5 min at 95◦C followed by 40 cycles of 45 s at
95◦C, 45 s at 60◦C (OR1D2, OR2AG1 and ACTA2), 45 s at 72◦C
and a final extension of 10 min at 72◦C. Following primer were

Immunocytochemical Staining
HASMCs were cultured on 30 mm coverslips until 80%
confluence was reached. After a washing step in PBS, the cells
were fixed in ice-cold acetone for 5 min. To avoid non-specific
antibody binding, the cells were blocked in 1% cold water
fish gelatine (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) diluted in TBS with 0.05%
Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) before the incubation with
primary antibody. Antibodies directed against the ORs OR1D2
(Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO, USA) and OR2AG1 (Novus
Biologicals, Littleton, CO, USA) as well as against the olfactory
signaling components ACIII (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas,
TX, USA), Gαolf (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA),
CNGA2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA), and
CNGA4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA) were used.
The cells were co-incubated with an antibody directed against
smooth muscle actin (ACTA2; Abcam, Cambridge, UK) to verify
that all cells are HASMCs. To analyse the specificity of OR1D2
and OR2AG1 antibodies, these receptors were overexpressed
in HANA3A cells. For that, pCI plasmids containing the
sequence of the OR-coding region were transfected (OR1D2
NCBI Accession No.: NM_002548.2; OR2AG1 NCBI Accession
No.: NM_001004489.2). As a control, cells were mock transfected
with pCI plasmid. Fluorophore-coupled secondary antibodies
(Alexa Fluor 488 or 546 nm; Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) were
used, and the cells were coated with Prolong Antifade Gold (Life
Technologies, USA). The fluorescent signals were detected using
a confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM 510 Meta, Germany) with
a 40x oil immersion objective and the Leica Application Suite
software (LAS, Leica, Germany). The images where processed
using Corel Draw X5 (Corel, USA).
Immunohistochemical Staining of Lung
Tissue
Paraffin-embedded human lung tissue was deparaffinized using
Roti R
�-Histol (Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany) and a subsequent
dehydration step with isopropanol was conducted. The tissue
was rehydrated with an ethanol-series and washed twice with
0.01 M PBS buffer. Next, antigen retrieval and permeabilization
steps were performed. To prevent unspecific primary antibody
binding, sections were blocked in 5% normal serum for 10
min. Primary antibody (OR1D2 or OR2AG1, dilution: 1:50) was
incubated in 0.01 M PBS buffer at 4◦C over night. Sections
were washed again with 0.01 M PBS buffer and horse radish
peroxidase (HRP)-coupled secondary antibody (anti-rabbit) was
incubated for 45 min (dilution: 1:1000). VECTASTAIN R
�Elite
avidin/biotin (ABC)-based Kit (Vector laboratories, Burlingame,
USA) was used after the manufacturer’s recommendations.
3,3′-diaminobenzidine was incubated until a sufficient staining
developed and the reaction was stopped with 0.1 M PB buffer
on 4◦C. Immunohistochemical staining was detected with an
Olympus BX 43 microscope (10x objective). Lung tissue was
obtained from patients undergoing a surgical intervention during
a carcinoma resection. This was conducted according to the
Declaration of Helsinki and all patients gave their written
consent.
Western Blotting
Whole-protein lysate was extracted from sedimented HASMCs,
followed by solubilization in an appropriate volume of RIPA
buffer, mechanical homogenization and a final centrifugation
(1000 g for 10 min). A sample of the whole protein fraction
was collected and prepared in Laemmli’s buffer for western blot
analysis. For the membrane preparation, whole protein lysate was
subjected to ultracentrifugation (35,000 g for 2 h). The precipitate
and a sample of the supernatant were dissolved in Laemmli’s
buffer for further western blot analyses. Samples of all fractions
were loaded on SDS gels, blotted on nitrocellulose membranes
(GE healthcare, UK) and incubated with the aforementioned
antibodies after a blocking step in 50% casein (50% TBS buffer,
50% casein in TBS, Thermo Scientific, USA). Primary antibodies
against OR1D2, OR2AG1, ACIII, Gαolf, CNGA2, and CNGA4
were diluted 1:250 in 25% casein (75% TBS buffer, 25% casein).
Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-coupled secondary antibodies
were used (goat anti-rabbit, rabbit anti-goat, Bio-Rad, UK)
for immunodetection. ECL western blotting detection reagent
(GE Healthcare, UK) was used for the detection step, and the
chemiluminescence was imaged using a Fusion-SL 3500-WL
(Vilber Lourmat, Germany).
Calcium Imaging
HASMCs cultured in 35 mm cell culture dishes were incubated
with 3 µM fura-2-acetoxymethyl ester (Molecular Probes) for
30 min at 37◦C. The growth medium was exchanged with
extracellular solution, and fluorometric imaging was performed
as previously described (Spehr et al., 2003; Busse et al., 2014;

 Kalbe et al.

Maßberg et al., 2015). Depending on the experimental approach,
the cells were exposed to 0.1–3 mM amyl butyrate (Henkel,
Germany), 0.0001–100 µM bourgeonal (Givaudan, Switzerland),
or 300 µM of the other OR1D2 agonists [Lilial (Givaudan,
Switzerland) and 4-PBA (Givaudan, Switzerland)] using a
specialized microcapillary application system. All substances
were pre-diluted in DMSO (maximal final concentration
0.1%) and dissolved in extracellular solution to the desired
concentration. Inhibitors and antagonists were used as published
in previous studies and either co-applied [L-cis-diltiazem 100
µM (Abcam, UK; Leung et al., 2010; Busse et al., 2014) and
undecanal 200 µM (Sigma-Aldrich, USA)] or pre-incubated
[MDL12330A 50 µM (Enzo Life Sciences, USA; Grosmaitre
et al., 2006) and SQ22536 200 µM (Enzo Life Sciences,
USA; Benbernou et al., 2011)]. Cells were washed before and
after application of the agonists or inhibitors. Data from the
calcium imaging experiments were processed using the Leica
Application Software (LAS, Leica, Germany). The amplitudes
and EC50-values were calculated using Sigma Plot (Systat, USA).
Concentration-response curves were fitted with the 4-parameter
Hill model using Sigma Plot.
cAMP-Glo Assay
HASMCs were seeded on poly-d-lysine-coated 96-well-plates
(NUNC) at a density of 1.5 × 104 cells/well. Elevated cAMP
level was measured using the cAMP-Glo
TM Assay (Promega)
according to the manufacturer’s recommendations and described
elsewhere (Maßberg et al., 2015). The data were normalized to
the DMSO (0.1%) control.
Contraction Assay
HASMC contraction experiments were performed with a
collagen gel-based assay kit (Cell Contraction Assay; Cell Biolabs
CBA-201) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Cytokine Measurements
For stimulation, HASMCs were plated at equal density in 6-
well-plates. Before stimulation, sub-confluent cell monolayers
(∼80% confluence) in six-well-cell culture plates were deprived
of serum for 24 h in serum-free and low-glucose (1 g/l) DMEM
(Invitrogen; cat#-41966-029) supplemented containing 1 mM
sodium pyruvate, 2 mM L-glutamine, 1% non-essential amino
acids, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 µg/ml streptomycin, 1.5 µg/ml
amphotericin B, 1 mM insulin (Sigma-Aldrich cat#-I1882), 5
mg/ml, apo-transferrin (Sigma-Aldrich cat#-T1147) and 100
µM ascorbic acid (Sigma-Aldrich cat#-A4403), as described
previously (Knobloch et al., 2009, 2013, 2014).
HASMCs were stimulated in serum-free and low-glucose
(1 g/l) DMEM supplemented with 1 mM sodium pyruvate,
2 mM L-glutamine, 1% non-essential amino acids, 100 U/ml
penicillin, 100 µg/ml streptomycin, and 1.5 µg/ml amphotericin
B. To measure the levels of cytokines in the supernatant,
untreated HASMCs at passages 2–7 were stimulated with either
bourgeonal (100 µM), amyl butyrate (100 µM), or undecanal
(200 µM) for 24, 48, or 72 h. Cell viability was determined by
Trypan blue staining. None of the drugs induced cell death
in HASMCs at the conditions used in this study. The IL-8
and GM-CSF concentrations in the cell culture supernatants
were measured with an ELISA (Duo Sets DY208, DY215; R&D
Systems) according to standard protocols (Knobloch et al., 2009,
2013, 2014).
Statistical Analysis
All results were tested for normality and equal variance. Data that
passed the equal variance and normality tests were subjected to a
two-tailed unpaired t-test. Data that failed the aforementioned
tests were subjected to a Mann-Whitney U-test. All values
represent the mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM)
of at least three independent experiments. In all figures, the
significance of differences is represented as follows: ∗p < 0.05,
∗∗p < 0.01, and ∗∗∗p < 0.001.
RESULTS
Specific Odorants Elicit an Intracellular
Ca2+ Increase via Olfactory Receptors in
HASMCs
In this study, we first aimed to characterize the odor-dependent
activation of HASMCs. Because OR activation leads to a Ca2+
influx in OR neurons and Ca2+ initiates the contraction of
HASMCs, we investigated the intracellular Ca2+ levels after
receptor activation using fluorometric calcium imaging. First, we
stimulated HASMCs with either amyl butyrate [specific ligand for
OR2AG1 (Mashukova et al., 2006)] or bourgeonal [specific ligand
for OR1D2 (Spehr et al., 2003)], which both induced a strong
transient intracellular Ca2+ increase (Figure 1). In addition, amyl
butyrate (300 µM) was repetitively applied for 30 s and elicited
reproducible strong Ca2+ signals in most cells (Figure 2A). We
analyzed the concentration-dependence of the cytosolic Ca2+
levels after stimulation with amyl butyrate in the HASMCs and
calculated an EC50-value of 251.39 µM (Figure 2B).
Moreover, we examined the activation of OR1D2 in more
detail by applying the known ligands bourgeonal (100 µM), lilial
(300 µM), and 4-PBA (300 µM), which all induced reproducible
strong Ca2+ responses in most HASMCs (Figures 2C,E,F). The
repeated application of bourgeonal led to recurrent Ca2+ signals
(Figure 2C). We monitored the concentration-dependence of the
Ca2+ responses to the application of bourgeonal and measured
an EC50 of 0.5 µM (Figure 2D). To exclude any bias of the dose-
response curves due to shifted baselines or desensitization after
repetitive stimulation, different odorant concentrations were
administered in single applications.
Olfactory Receptors and Signaling
Proteins are Expressed at the RNA and
Protein Levels in HASMCs
Next, we investigated the transcript levels of these receptors in
the HASMCs of three different donors via RT-qPCR and found
specific amplicons at a size of ∼250 bp for OR1D2, OR2AG1,
and the smooth muscle-specific actin ACTA2 (Figure 3A). We
calculated the �Ct-value normalized to ACTA2 and observed
a higher transcript level of OR2AG1 in relation to OR1D2
(Figure 3B). To characterize the protein expression of OR and

signaling factors, immunocytochemical staining was performed
using specific antibodies. We observed the expression of the
human ORs OR1D2 and OR2AG1 at the protein level. ACTA2
was used as a HASMC marker (Figure 3C). We verified these
results using western blot experiments with the cytosolic and
membrane-enriched fractions of HASMC (Figures 3D,E). We
detected specific proteins bands for the ORs OR1D2 (35 kDa;
Figure 3D) and OR2AG1 (35 kDa; Figure 3E), as well as signals
at the protein weight of receptor dimers. The protein abundance
was stronger in the membrane fraction than in the cytosolic
fraction. In addition, OR1D2 and OR2AG1 proteins were
also detected in human biopsies using immunohistochemical
staining (Figures 3F–H). There, OR1D2 and OR2AG1 were
localized in the bronchial epithelium, in smooth muscle cells
and cells of the submucosa. To analyse the specificity of
OR1D2 and OR2AG1 antibodies in the immunocytochemical
staining, we transfected HANA3A cells with OR1D2- and
OR2AG1-carrying plasmids and observed a specific stain of
HANA3A (Supplementary Figures 2A,B). Mock-transfected cells
showed no stain with either OR1D2 or OR2AG1 antibody
(Supplementary Figures 2C,D). Additionally, we specifically
stained cells for the olfactory signal transduction proteins
ACIII, Golf, CNGA2, and CNGA4 (Figure 4A). Negative
controls using only secondary fluorophore-coupled antibody
remained unstained (Supplementary Figure 1). Furthermore,
we confirmed the expression of ACIII (Figure 4B), Gαolf
(Figure 4C), CNGA2 (Figure 4D), and CNGA4 (Figure 4E)
within the membrane and cytosol of the cell via western blot
analysis.
Odor-Specific Intracellular Ca2+ Increase
in HASMCs is Mediated by the Canonical
Olfactory Signaling Pathway
To identify the signaling pathways that become activated by
odors in HASMCs, we performed pharmacological blocking
experiments and analyzed the intracellular Ca2+ levels. To
confirm the involvement of OR1D2 in bourgeonal-induced
Ca2+ responses, we co-applied the known antagonist undecanal
(Spehr et al., 2003; 200 µM) together with bourgeonal (100
µM). Undecanal significantly reduced the bourgeonal-induced
Ca2+ response, and this effect was reversible after wash-out
(Figure 5A). After removing the extracellular free Ca2+ ions
using the Ca2+ chelator EGTA (5 mM), the bourgeonal-
induced Ca2+ increase was completely abolished (Figure 5B),
indicating the importance of extracellular Ca2+. Next, the
adenylyl cyclase inhibitors SQ22536 (200 µM) and MDL12330A
(50 µM) were used to investigate the contribution of the
cAMP-producing enzyme in this signaling cascade. In the
presence of both blockers, the OR-dependent Ca2+ increase
was significantly reduced (Figures 5C,D). We performed cAMP
assays and validated the production of cAMP after stimulation
with bourgeonal (Supplementary Figure 3B). This effect was
significantly inhibited by undecanal (Supplementary Figure 3C).
Moreover, the CNG channel inhibitor L-cis-diltiazem (100 µM)
was used to analyse the involvement of CNG channels. The
bourgeonal-elicited Ca2+ increase was significantly reduced in
the presence of this blocker (Figure 5E).
To examine the dependence of the OR2AG1-specific pathway
in HASMCs on the aforementioned olfactory signaling proteins,
experiments with the specific OR2AG1 agonist amyl butyrate
(300 µM) were performed. The withdrawal of extracellular
free Ca2+ via EGTA abolished the amyl butyrate-induced Ca2+
responses (Figure 6A). The adenylyl cyclase blockers SQ22536
(Figure 6B) and MDL12330A (Figure 6C) both significantly
reduced the amyl butyrate-induced Ca2+ signals. Again, we
verified the production of cAMP upon stimulation with amyl
butyrate by a cAMP assay (Supplementary Figure 3A). In
the presence of L-cis-diltiazem, the amyl butyrate-triggered
Ca2+ currents were also strongly diminished (Figure 6D).
Both effects were completely reversible after washing out
the respective inhibitor. Interestingly, we observed that the
histamine-induced Ca2+ response of HASMCs can be inhibited
by the co-application of either amyl butyrate or bourgeonal
(Supplementary Figure 4).
Olfactory Receptor Activation Affects the
Contractility of HASMCs
Next, we investigated the physiological importance of OR-
activation in HASMCs with a collagen gel-based contraction
assay. The gel percentage contraction in response to histamine
(100 µM) was measured in the presence of amyl butyrate
(100 µM; activation of OR2AG1) after 34 min of incubation

FIGURE 2 | Stimulation with agonists of OR2AG1 and OR1D2 led to an intracellular Ca2+ increase in HASMCs. (A) Repetitive stimulation with amyl butyrate
(300 µM, duration: 30 s) elicited a reproducible transient increase in intracellular Ca2+ measured with the ratiometric Ca2+ indicator FURA-2AM. (B) Amyl butyrate, an
agonist for OR2AG1, activated HASMCs in a dose-dependent manner with an EC50 of 253.39 µM (N = 6). (C) The application of the OR1D2 agonist bourgeonal
(100 µM, duration: 30 s) led to an increase in intracellular Ca2+, and repetitive stimulation exerted a reproducible effect. (D) Bourgeonal was able to activate HASMCs
in a dose-dependent manner with an EC50 of 0.5043 µM (N = 3–5). (E,F) The application of the OR1D2 agonists lilial (300 µM, duration: 30 s; E) and
4-phenylbutyrate (4-PBA; 300 µM, duration: 30 s; F) led to an intracellular Ca2+ increase in ratiometric Ca2+ imaging experiments. Bars indicate the application
duration. Error bars represent the ± SEM of three to four independent experiments.
(Figure 7A). The relative contraction strength was estimated
by calculating the decrease in the gel diameter (Figure 7B).
A medium control was performed to exclude the effects
of spontaneous or mechanically triggered contraction. The
contraction of histamine-exposed (100 µM) HASMCs was
significantly stronger than those of cells treated with 100 µM
amyl butyrate and the DMSO control (Figure 7C). The observed
effect during histamine incubation was completely abolished
after co-treatment with amyl butyrate (100 µM), indicating that
OR2AG1 activation inhibits the contraction of HASMCs. This
effect could be inhibited by the co-stimulation with the AC
inhibitor SQ22536 (Figure 7E).
In contrast, the activation of OR1D2 via bourgeonal (100 µM)
evoked an increase in HASMC contraction that was comparable
to the histamine-induced effect. Bourgeonal-triggered cell
contractility was significantly inhibited by co-applying the
specific
antagonist
undecanal
(200
µM;
Figures 7D,F).
Bourgeonal-induced contraction was also inhibited by the
AC inhibitor SQ22536 and co-application with histamine, but
not by L-cis-diltiazem or amyl butyrate (Figure 7F).

OR1D2 Activation Induces the Release of
the Cytokines IL-8 and GM-CSF in
HASMCs
Finally, we investigated whether OR activation might lead
to cellular responses that are directly associated with airway
inflammation and remodeling. We analyzed the production
of cytokines that play key roles in chronic inflammatory
airway diseases, cell counts (indicates proliferation), and
cell death. Bourgeonal but not amyl butyrate induced the
production of IL-8 and GM-CSF in HASMCs in a time-
dependent manner. Maximum secretion was found after 72 h
of stimulation (Figures 8A,C). The effects of bourgeonal were
clearly reduced by undecanal and by the ERK MAPK inhibitor
PD98059 but not by inhibitors of p38 MAPK (SB203580) or
Jnk (SP600125; Figures 8B,D). This behavior indicates that
OR1D2 transmits signals via the ERK pathway to regulate
IL-8 and GM-CSF production in HASMCs in response to
bourgeonal.
Neither bourgeonal nor amyl butyrate significantly affected
the cell counts after 6 days of incubation, although the
highest concentration of amyl butyrate tended to reduce cell
counts (Figure 8E). This finding indicates that neither odorant
dramatically influences cell proliferation or death. The data
further show that the upregulation of cytokine release by
odorants did not result from an increase in the number of
cells but from an increase in the production of cytokines in
single cells.
DISCUSSION
In this study, we demonstrated that the human ORs OR2AG1
and OR1D2 are functionally expressed in HASMCs at the RNA

FIGURE 5 | Bourgeonal-induced Ca2+ increase in HASMCs is dependent on the extracellular Ca2+ concentration, production of cAMP, and opening of
CNG channels. (A) The bourgeonal-specific antagonist undecanal significantly inhibited the activation of OR1D2 and, thereby, Ca2+ increases in HASMCs.
Bourgeonal (100 µM) was first applied for 30 s. After a 3 min wash in Ringer’s solution, undecanal (200 µM) and bourgeonal (100 µM) were co-applied for 30 s. The
cells were again washed with Ringer’s solution, followed by an application of bourgeonal (100 µM) for 30 s. The undecanal-induced inhibition was reversible (N = 5).
(B) Bourgeonal (100 µM) was applied for 30 s in Ringer’s solution containing 2 mM extracellular Ca2+ or in a Ca2+-free condition with 5 mM EGTA. Under Ca2+ free
conditions, the cytosolic Ca2+ increase was completely abolished (N = 6). (C) Bourgeonal (100 µM) was applied for 30 s after a 5 min incubation with the adenylyl
cyclase inhibitor SQ22536 (200 µM). Ca2+ influx was significantly reduced after incubation with SQ22536 (N = 3). (D) MDL12330A (50 µM), an adenylyl cyclase
inhibitor, was applied for 2 min, followed by co-application with bourgeonal (100 µM, duration: 30 s), which significantly inhibited bourgeonal-induced Ca2+ increase.
This effect was reversible after a 4 min washing step (N = 4). (E) The CNG channel inhibitor L-cis-diltiazem (100 µM) was co-applied with bourgeonal (100 µM) for
30 s and significantly reduced the Ca2+ influx induced by bourgeonal. The inhibitory effect of L-cis-diltiazem was reversible after a wash-out (N = 6). The bars of all
experiments indicate the stimulus duration. All error bars represent the ±SEM of at three to six independent experiments. Significance was tested with an unpaired

and protein levels and are ubiquitously present in the bronchial
tissue. The expression of ORs as specialized chemosensors in
tissues and cells outside the nose has been previously reported
(Feldmesser et al., 2006; Flegel et al., 2013). However, only a
few studies have investigated the physiological impact of these
ectopically expressed ORs. We showed for the first time that
the activation of OR2AG1 by its specific ligand amyl butyrate
(Neuhaus et al., 2009) and of OR1D2 by different known
ligands (Spehr et al., 2003) both induced a transient Ca2+
increase in HASMCs. The specific activation of OR1D2 was
verified by the application of the known antagonist undecanal
(Spehr et al., 2003), which significantly reduced the bourgenol-
elicited Ca2+ signals in HASMCs. Specific antagonists have
previously been demonstrated to be reliable tools for validating
OR activation (Spehr et al., 2003; Oka et al., 2004; Neuhaus
et al., 2009). In addition, we found that both receptors
trigger a cAMP-dependent signal transduction cascade, including
the activation of adenylyl cyclase, generation of Camp, and
opening of the CNG channel. Interestingly, we detected the
olfactory signaling proteins ACIII, Golf, CNGA2, and CNGA4
in western blot and immunohistochemical experiments, further
indicating that olfactory signaling in HASMCs depends on
cAMP. The involvement of olfactory proteins in cellular signaling
within non-chemosensory tissues has been demonstrated in
keratinocytes (Busse et al., 2014) and the hepatocellular
carcinoma cell line Huh7 (Maßberg et al., 2015), and these

signals initialized diverse physiological reactions. Generally,
HASMCs require increased intracellular Ca2+ levels to trigger
a contraction. However, most studies of HASMCs have focused
on Ca2+ release from intracellular stores, like the sarcoplasmic
reticulum, and not on extracellular Ca2+ influx, as observed
in cardiac, vascular, and skeletal muscle cells. Nevertheless, we
here present a novel molecular mechanism that leads to elevated
cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations via chemosensory GPCR, adenylyl
cyclase, and cAMP generation as well as CNG channels. We
observed an inhibitory effect of bourgeonal and amyl butyrate on
the histamine-induced Ca2+ increase and speculate a potential
crosstalk between the underlying signaling pathways. Histamine
is known to activate a phospholipase C-mediated pathway and
a subsequent release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores (Kotlikoff
et al., 1987; Murray and Kotlikoff, 1991). Another product of
the phospholipase C, diacylglycerol, can inhibit CNG channel
opening (Crary et al., 2000). This could be one possible inference
between histamine- and bourgeonal-induced intracellular Ca2+
responses. The importance of cAMP as a secondary messenger
molecule in HASMCs and a therapeutic target for asthma
and COPD patients has already been demonstrated with
regard to β2-adrenoreceptors (Billington et al., 2012). In this
context, cAMP antagonizes HASMC contraction, inhibits cell
proliferation and migration, and combats the pathophysiology
of airway narrowing and remodeling. Furthermore, solitary
pulmonary neuroendocrine cells reportedly express different

itself did not alter the gel diameter under these conditions and produced no significant changes in relation to the medium control. The co-incubation of amyl butyrate

ORs and can respond to inhaled volatile chemicals via the
secretion of distinct neuropeptides. Because COPD patients
exhibited altered chemoresponsiveness, these findings may
help to clarify odorant-induced airway reactions (Gu et al.,
2014).
Remarkably, we found that OR1D2 and OR2AG1 specifically
trigger
odor-enhanced
or
odor-inhibited
cell
contraction,
respectively, although both act on a cAMP-dependent signaling
pathway. Generally, HASMC contraction is mediated by an
increase in the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration and leads to
the phosphorylation of myosin, whereas dilatation depends
on cAMP and inhibits myosin phosphorylation (Gao et al.,
2013). The activation of OR2AG1 leads to a decrease of the
histamine-induced contraction via an AC-dependent signaling
pathway. Thus, our data indicate that OR2AG1 activation
via the volatile ligand amyl butyrate might constitute a novel
therapeutic target to achieve smooth muscle dilatation in chronic
inflammatory airway disease patients. Further, we speculate that
the particular ORs might initiate different down-stream signaling
molecules, such as protein kinase A [relaxation (Murthy et al.,
2003)], Epac [relaxation (Roscioni et al., 2011)], protein kinase
C [contraction (Walsh et al., 1994)], or guanine nucleotide
exchanging factors [RhoGEFs; contraction (Artamonov et al.,
2013)], thereby regulating further cellular responses. The
bourgeonal-mediated contraction of HASMCs seems to be
dependent on cAMP signaling, but does not depend on the
opening of CNG channels. Beside the aforementioned pathways,
Ca2+-independent contraction can be modulated and initiated
by differences in the MCLK gene expression (Benayoun et al.,
2003) or Ca2+-independent Rho kinase signaling (Schaafsma
et al., 2008; Chiba et al., 2010). Moreover, complex spatio-
temporal compartmentalized cAMP signaling networks have
been shown to correlate with altered physiological output and
the onset of chronic obstructive inflammatory diseases (Dekkers
et al., 2013). Interestingly, the histamine-induced contraction is
interfered by the co-stimulation of bourgeonal. The complexity
of OR-signaling was demonstrated in a previous study, where
it has been shown that a murine OR can simultaneously bind
two different G proteins (Golf and Go). In this context, two
different odorants trigger completely independent pathways
after activating the same OR ex vivo (Scholz et al., 2016).
This dual capacity is discussed for GPCRs in general (Gurwitz
et al., 1994; González-Maeso and Sealfon, 2012; Zocher et al.,
2012). In addition, the extracellular environment has been
shown to influence contractile gene expression in SMCs and
thus phenotypic changes, such as contraction. For example,
plating SMCs on collagen IV resulted in elevated contractile
gene expression, whereas polymerized collagen I, which was
used in our study, inhibited the expression of these genes
(Koyama et al., 1996; Orr et al., 2009). In vitro gel contraction
analysis revealed that the phenotype of cells isolated from
patients with asthma is preserved and show a hypercontractility
to the constrictor histamine (Matsumoto et al., 2007). Lung
diseases like asthma affect the extracellular matrix remodeling
of HASMCs. It was shown that this effect on the remodeling
can also be analyzed by collagen gel experiments in long-term
stimulus (72 h) experiments (Bourke et al., 2011). The slowly
decreasing gel diameter is not associated with contraction.
However, we observed a fast (<30 min) and strong effect on
the gel diameter upon histamine and bourgeonal application,
which highlights their contraction-inducing properties. In
general, a detailed molecular analysis of potential down-stream
key elements and the implications to asthma/COPD should
be conducted in future studies with cells or tissues of diseased
patients.
Evidence suggests that perfumes can exacerbate asthma
(Kumar et al., 1995; Berger et al., 2006; Henneberger, 2007).
Exacerbations are an acute worsening of symptoms that
often lead to hospitalization and trigger disease progression.
Pathophysiologically, asthma is characterized by chronic airway
inflammation that increases in severe and exacerbated asthma,
and these changes are associated with IL-8 and GM-CSF
hyperproduction in immunoactive airway cells (Barnes, 2008).
We have recently shown that HASMCs contribute to chronic
airway inflammation in asthma, rendering them an auspicious
cellular therapeutic target (Knobloch et al., 2010, 2013). Here,
we demonstrated that bourgeonal (synthetic odor for lily-of-
the-valley, commonly used in perfumes) induces IL-8 and GM-
CSF release from HASMCs. These data are the first to indicate
the influence of an odorant on the production of inflammatory
cytokines in a lung cell type. Because bourgeonal did not
significantly influence HASMC proliferation, we can exclude that
effect of changes in cell number on the cytokine concentration;
instead, these changes are only due to changes in secretion.
Our data showing that undecanal and PD98059 reduce cytokine
production in bourgeonal-exposed HASMCs provide a first
indication that OR1D2 antagonists and ERK-inhibitors might be
useful in the context of chronic inflammatory airway diseases. IL-
8 and GM-CSF also contribute to airway inflammation in stable
and exacerbated COPD (Barnes, 2008). Thus, our data suggest
that exposure to distinct odorants might influence COPD and
asthma pathogenesis.
