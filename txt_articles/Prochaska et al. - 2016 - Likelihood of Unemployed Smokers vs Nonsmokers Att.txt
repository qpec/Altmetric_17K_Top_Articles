IMPORTANCE Studies in the United States and Europe have found higher smoking prevalence
among unemployed job seekers relative to employed workers. While consistent, the extant
epidemiologic investigations of smoking and work status have been cross-sectional, leaving it
underdetermined whether tobacco use is a cause or effect of unemployment.
OBJECTIVE To examine differences in reemployment by smoking status in a 12-month period.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS An observational 2-group study was conducted from
September 10, 2013, to August 15, 2015, in employment service settings in the San Francisco
Bay Area (California). Participants were 131 daily smokers and 120 nonsmokers, all of whom
were unemployed job seekers. Owing to the study’
s observational design, a propensity score
analysis was conducted using inverse probability weighting with trimmed observations.
Including covariates of time out of work, age, education, race/ethnicity, and perceived health
status as predictors of smoking status.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Reemployment at 12-month follow-up.
RESULTS Of the 251 study participants, 165 (65.7) were men, with a mean (SD) age of 48 (11)
years; 96 participants were white (38.2%), 90 were black (35.9%), 24 were Hispanic (9.6%),
18 were Asian (7.2%), and 23 were multiracial or other race (9.2%); 78 had a college degree
(31.1%), 99 were unstably housed (39.4%), 70 lacked reliable transportation (27.9%), 52 had
a criminal history (20.7%), and 72 had received prior treatment for alcohol or drug use
(28.7%). Smokers consumed a mean (SD) of 13.5 (8.2) cigarettes per day at baseline. At
12-month follow-up (217 participants retained [86.5%]), 60 of 108 nonsmokers (55.6%) were
reemployed compared with 29 of 109 smokers (26.6%) (unadjusted risk difference, 0.29;
95% CI, 0.15-0.42). With 6% of analysis sample observations trimmed, the estimated risk
difference indicated that nonsmokers were 30% (95% CI, 12%-48%) more likely on average
to be reemployed at 1 year relative to smokers. Results of a sensitivity analysis with additional
covariates of sex, stable housing, reliable transportation, criminal history, and prior treatment
for alcohol or drug use (25.3% of observations trimmed) reduced the difference in
employment attributed to smoking status to 24% (95% CI, 7%-39%), which was still a
significant difference. Among those reemployed at 1 year, the average hourly wage for
smokers was significantly lower (mean [SD], $15.10 [$4.68]) than for nonsmokers (mean [SD],
$20.27 [$10.54]; F(1,86) = 6.50, P = .01).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE To our knowledge, this is the first study to prospectively track
reemployment success by smoking status. Smokers had a lower likelihood of reemployment
at 1 year and were paid significantly less than nonsmokers when reemployed. Treatment of
tobacco use in unemployment service settings is worth testing for increasing reemployment
success and financial well-being.

While consistent, the extant epidemiologic investigations
have been cross-sectional, leaving it underdetermined as to
whether smoking is a cause or effect of unemployment. To-
bacco use among employees is associated with greater health
care costs, unproductive time, and absenteeism.6-8 An em-
ployeewhosmokescostsprivateemployersintheUnitedStates
an estimated excess cost (above that for a nonsmoking em-
ployee) of $5816 per year.9 Concerned about the health risks
and related costs associated with tobacco use, employers are
increasinglytakingactiontoreducesmokingintheworkforce.10
Smokers are not a protected class entitled to special legal pro-
tections, based on a 1987 Federal Appeals Court ruling,11 and
hiring policies requiring that employees do not use nicotine are
legal in more than 20 states. Hence, employers can make judg-
ments about tobacco use among prospective employees. For
example, health care and other industries have implemented
testing of applicants’urine for nicotine or cotinine (a nicotine
metabolite) as a contingency for employment. Employers have
prohibited tobacco use during working hours, offered finan-
cialincentivesforemployeestoquitsmoking,orchargedhigher
medical insurance co-payments for those who continue to
smoke. In many states, employers are able to fire or discipline
employees who smell of tobacco smoke at work.12 Employees

Research has not quantified the economic burden of to-
baccouseforjobseekers.Toevaluatewhethertobaccouseisin-
deed a detriment to employability, prospective trials that ob-
serve unemployed smokers and nonsmokers through the job
search process are needed. Our study, using a longitudinal ob-
servational design, sought to examine differences in reemploy-
ment success by smoking status during a 12-month period. We
hypothesized that nonsmokers would be more successful than
smokersingainingreemployment.Amongthosereemployedat

Methods
Sample Recruitment
Smokers and nonsmokers were recruited from September 10,
2013, to August 15, 2015, from 2 employment development de-
partments in adjacent California counties (1 urban, San Fran-
cisco, and 1 suburban, Marin) serving a combined estimated
7000clientsannuallyintheSanFranciscoBayArea.Bothcoun-
ties had 100% smoke-free nonhospitality workplace laws that
banned smoking of tobacco products in an enclosed space at
a place of employment, with several designated exceptions,
and comparable unemployment rates at the start of recruit-
ment (Marin, 5.0%; San Francisco, 5.2%) and study comple-
tion (Marin, 3.5%; San Francisco, 3.6%). To be eligible, smok-
ers had to report daily smoking with a carbon monoxide breath
sample more than 10 ppm; nonsmokers had to deny tobacco
use in the past year with a carbon monoxide breath sample less
than10ppm.14Dailymarijuanauserswereexcluded,assmoked
cannabis can elevate carbon monoxide levels. Participants had
to be 18 years or older, English literate, unemployed, actively
job seeking at the time of study enrollment, able to provide col-
lateral sources of contact for follow-up, and not actively plan-
ning to relocate out of the area. Recruitment efforts were re-
active (via flyers) and proactive (via onsite outreach).

Key Points
Question Does reemployment success differ by smoking status?
Findings In this 2-group, 12-month prospective study with 251
unemployed job seekers, nonsmokers were 30% more likely on
average to be reemployed at 1 year relative to smokers. Among
those reemployed at 1 year, the average hourly wage was $5 higher
for nonsmokers than smokers.
Meaning Given the disparities in reemployment by smoking
status, treatment of tobacco use in unemployment service
settings is worth testing for increasing reemployment success and
financial well-being.

weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared). We
assessed criminal history reportable on a job application; prior
treatment for alcohol or drug use, including 12-step pro-
grams; and treatment for psychological or emotional prob-
lems. A question about general health had participants rate
their health as fair, poor, good, very good, or excellent. The
Kessler 6 scale assessed psychological distress, scored as low
(total score, <5), moderate (5-12), or high (>12).15
The primary outcome of interest was reemployment at 12-
month follow-up. We defined reemployment as current hired
work at least 10 hours per week or 40 hours per month. Among
those reemployed, we assessed their hourly wage. At base-
line, we assessed the reason for leaving their last position, du-
ration of unemployment, past year gross income, and career
cluster(s)ofinterest,categorizedperO*Netclassifications(part
of the American JobCenter Network [http://www.onetonline
.org]) (Table 1).
Measures of tobacco use were usual number of cigarettes
per day, the Fagerström Test for Cigarette Dependence,16 stage
of change for quitting smoking,17 past 30-day use of other to-
bacco and nicotine products, daily cost of smoking, and pref-
erence for menthol tobacco products. We assessed tobacco-
related work experiences (eg, perceived discrimination owing
to tobacco use) with a 4-point scale ranging from strongly dis-
agree to strongly agree, and work-related expectations as a re-
sult of tobacco abstinence (eg, increased productivity) with a
7-point Likert scale ranging from not likely at all to extremely
likely (Table 2).19
We created a measure to assess discretionary spending pri-
orities. Smokers ordered items based on what they were most
likelytopurchase,assumingfiniteresources,usingtheirdiscre-
tionaryfunds,definedasmoneyavailableafterone’

(Table 3). Possible rank values ranged from 1 to 13. The online
survey system randomly ordered the items for presentation.
Statistical Analysis
The study was powered to detect an absolute difference in re-
employment of 20% between smokers and nonsmokers at 12-
monthfollow-up(eg,50%vs70%).With2-tailedtesting,a0.05
type I error rate, and 80% retention, a sample size of 120 par-
ticipants per group provided greater than 80% power for de-
tecting this group difference. Analysis of variance, χ2, and
gamma tests for ordinal associations tested for group differ-
ences in baseline variables. Among those reemployed at 12
months, we performed analysis of variance tests for group dif-
ferences in hours worked and hourly wage by smoking status.
As this was an observational study comparing self-
selected groups (smokers vs nonsmokers), we used a propen-
sity score (PS) design20-25 to mitigate confounding and inves-
tigate the main causal hypothesis of interest. The PS design
helped to account for inherent differences between smokers
and nonsmokers that could produce biased estimates of the
effect of smoking on successful reemployment by balancing
the distribution of covariates between smokers and nonsmok-
ers. Under certain assumptions, a PS approach allows statis-
tical inference to be interpreted as causal inference.22
We conducted an inverse probability weight (IPW) analy-
sis with trimmed observations, where the weight was the in-
verse (ie, reciprocal) of the PS; the smoking and nonsmoking
groups were weighted so as to be similar (on average) to each
other in baseline characteristics. Propensity score–based IPWs
are used to enhance the internal validity of an analysis, while
survey sampling weights are used to support external valid-
ity or generalizability. Once each observation is weighted by
its IPW, the weighted average of the 2 groups are differenced,
which estimates the risk difference (RD). In our analysis, the
IPW-adjusted estimand was the causal effect of smoking sta-
tus on unemployment status.22
Before using IPWs to weight the observations, one must
ensurethatthe2comparisongroupsdonothavemembersthat
are completely dissimilar from the other group (ie, the groups
shareacommonsupport).Design-basedPSanalysisstartswith
careful consideration of which observational units should be
included in the study—using only preexposure covariates and
specifically excluding any information about the outcome in-
formation. Thus, the design-based portion of a PS analysis is
distinct from fitting the outcome model, which is not the im-
mediate goal of the PS approach. One important feature of a
PS design is that it identifies the set of observational units with
overlapping PS values; positivity (ie, the probability of not
smoking is strictly between 0 and 1) is a key assumption of the
PS approach. Positivity enforces that (in one particular sense)
the exposed group and the unexposed groups are not distinct
in terms of their baseline covariates, thus avoiding complete
confounding by baseline covariates.
To fulfill these criteria, we trimmed observations; that is,
we identified and dropped observations with extreme PS val-
ues estimated using variables other than the outcome, follow-
ing Crump et al.26 It would not be totally incorrect to com-
pare trimming in observational studies with the inclusion and
exclusion criteria in randomized clinical trials. One guideline
for trimming is that observations with PS values outside of the
interval [0.1, 0.9] should be dropped.26 Using both sets of PS
values(ie,fromnonsmokersandsmokers),ourtrimmingpoints
wereinsteaddefinedasthehighestminimumandlowestmaxi-
mum PS values (ie, 0.038 and 0.889 for the 5-covariate model;
0.124 and 0.903 for the 10-covariate model); hence, overlap
was empirically determined using our real data, which closely
aligns with the guideline for trimming. The full trimming-
based procedure involves first estimating the PS model covar-
iates on the full data set, trimming observations, and then re-
estimating these covariates using the trimmed data set; the
IPWs for the main analysis are then constructed using these
final PS estimates.
Analyses were done in R statistical software (R Founda-
tion for Statistical Computing) to estimate the PS through lo-
gistic regression using the glm package, and subsequently the
IPW-adjusted RD for unemployment at 12 months for non-
smokers with respect to smokers. The boot package was used
to estimate the SE of the IPW-adjusted RD estimator. The pri-
mary PS was specified using a logit link function and a linear
model that included a set of 5 covariates deemed most rel-
evant to reemployment (ie, time out of work, age, education,
race/ethnicity, perceived health status). We also conducted a
basicsensitivityanalysiscomparingtheprimaryPSresultswith
those of a PS model that doubled the number of covariates,

adding sex, housing stability, reliable transportation, criminal
history, and prior treatment for alcohol or drug use. Including
more covariates in a correct PS model with unknown predic-
tors is generally expected to increase the accuracy of IPW
estimators while decreasing precision. A related tradeoff is
that including more covariates in the PS model tends to lead
to less overlap between smokers and nonsmokers; the PS
analyst must trim more, therefore reducing precision. The
difference in the proportion of data trimmed between the
primary and sensitivity analyses was 4-fold. Last, we used
analysis of variance to test for group differences in hours
worked and hourly wage by smoking status among those
reemployed at 12 months.
Results
Baseline Characteristics
The full sample, 131 smokers and 120 nonsmokers, was 65.7%
male (N = 165), with 96 white participants (38.2%), 90 black
(35.9%), 24 Hispanic (9.6%), 18 Asian (7.2%), and 23 multira-
cial or other race (9.2%), with a mean (SD) age of 48 (11) years
and mean (SD) body mass index (calculated as weight in kilo-
grams divided by height in meters squared) of 26.7 (5.9); 129
were never married (51.4%), 99 were unstably housed (39.4%),
72 had received prior treatment for alcohol or drugs (28.7%)
and 106 for psychological or emotional problems (42.2%), 52
had a criminal history (20.7%), 70 lacked reliable transporta-
tion (27.9%), 92 had a high school degree or less (36.7%), 81
had completed some college (32.3%), and 78 had a college de-
gree (31.1%). A majority (142 [56.6%]) of the participants were
unemployed for more than 6 months; 62.0% (n = 157) re-
ported a gross income in the past year of less than $20 000.
The most common reason for leaving their last employer was
that their contract ended or they were laid off (145 [57.8%]),
followed by being fired (38 [15.1%]).
Table 1 compares baseline characteristics of smokers and
nonsmokers. Compared with nonsmokers, smokers were sig-
nificantly younger and less educated; more likely to be men,
African American or multiracial, never married, unstably
housed, and an urban resident; had a criminal history, unreli-
able transportation, and prior treatment for alcohol or drug
problems; and reported poorer health. Mental health mea-
sures and body mass index did not differ by smoking status.
Smokers were more chronically unemployed and reported
lower past year income than did nonsmokers. Smokers were
less likely than nonsmokers to be seeking employment in
business; education and training; health science; marketing,

rettesperdayforamean(SD)of28(12)years;63(48.1%)smoked
only menthol cigarettes, 56 (42.7%) smoked only nonmen-
thol cigarettes, and 12 (9.2%) smoked both kinds. A majority
(75 [57.3%]) of smokers reported relighting their extinguished
cigarettes,with33.6%(n = 44)doingsodaily.Fagerströmscores
were a mean (SD) of 5.6 (1.5), indicating a moderate level of de-
pendence; 99 of smoking participants (75.6%) smoked within
30 minutes of waking. Nearly half (62 [47.3%]) of those who
smoked cigarettes used additional tobacco products in the past
30days,includingcigars(30[22.9%]),e-cigarettes(16[12.2%]),
cigarillos(14[10.7%]),blunts(10[7.6%]),pipes(9[6.9%]),chew-
ing tobacco (5 [3.8%]), hookah (3 [2.3%]), and snus (3 [2.3%]),
a form of smokeless tobacco. Few used nicotine replacement
inthepast30days,includingpatch(10[7.6]%),gum(10[7.6%]),
lozenge(2[1.5%]),andnasalspray(2[1.5%]).Participantsspent
a mean (SD) of $6.49 ($4.35) per day (median, $5.00) on to-
bacco. Typical purchasing was by the pack (112 [85.5%]), with
21[16.0%]purchasingcigarettesindividually(ie,“loosies”),and
8 [6.1%] rolling their own cigarettes. At baseline, 61 smokers
(46.6%) were in the precontemplation stage of change for quit-
ting smoking, 44 (33.6%) in the contemplation stage, and 26
(19.8%) in the preparation stage.

abstinence expectancies of the sample.18 Nearly all (119
[90.8%]) had made a 24-hour attempt to quit smoking in their
lifetime and 85 [64.9%] had done so in the past year. Most (93
[71.0%]) were advised to quit smoking by a health care pro-
fessional, yet few used evidence-based cessation ap-
proaches. Nearly half (59 [45.0%]) reported that an employer
offered them a cigarette or encouraged them to smoke, 46
(35.1%) were criticized by an employer for smoking, and

11 (8.4%) were fired owing to tobacco use. Few smokers re-
ported support for quitting smoking from an employer (9
[6.9%]) or career counselor (10 [7.6%]).
Table 3 summarizes ratings for smokers’discretionary
spending priorities. Tobacco was ranked at the top (lowest
score) ahead of basic needs and job-seeking necessities, such
as transportation funds and cellular telephone costs. Nico-
tine replacement had the lowest mean rank. Heavier smok-
ing was associated with a higher prioritization (lower score)
of tobacco (Pearson r = –0.19; P = .04). Among the top-
ranked items, 20 respondents (15.3%) selected tobacco as their
first priority; 19 (14.5%) selected nutritious food, 14 (10.7%)
transportation, and 13 (9.9%) cellular telephone costs.
Reemployment
A total of 217 participants (86.5%) completed 12-month sur-
veys; 89 reported being reemployed (41.0%). An additional 6
participants (3 nonsmokers, 3 smokers) reported working less
than 10 hours per week. Study retention was comparable for
smokers (109 [83.2%]) and nonsmokers (108 [90.0%]) (χ2
df = 1,
2.47; P = .12). Among those completing the 12-month survey,
60 nonsmokers (55.6%) and 29 smokers (26.6%) were re-
employedat1year.TheunadjustedRDinreemploymentis0.29
(95% CI, 0.15-0.42).
InourprimaryPSanalysis,thePSwasspecifiedusingalogit
link function and a linear model that included the covariates
of time out of work, age, education, race/ethnicity, and per-
ceived health status. Observations with PS less than 0.047 or
greater than 0.903 were trimmed from the original sample of
109 smokers and 108 nonsmokers. The trimmed sample con-
tained 107 smokers and 102 nonsmokers (3.7% excluded). The
RD of reemployment for nonsmokers vs smokers was 0.30
(SE = 0.09) (95% CI, 0.12-0.48). That is, after controlling for
the 5 covariates of greatest concern and trimming to ensure
common support, we estimate that if all participants in the
study changed from being smokers to being nonsmokers then
there would be a 30% increase in reemployment.
Inthesensitivityanalysis,themodelwith10covariateswas
fit on a trimmed sample with 82 smokers and 80 nonsmokers
(25.3% excluded), yielding an RD estimate of 0.24 (SE = 0.08)
(95%CI,0.07-0.39).Qualitatively,thissensitivityanalysisagreed
with our primary analysis, and the 95% CIs also overlapped, in-
dicating no significant difference in the estimates. A reduced
effect size was found using the 10-covariate model, so addi-
tional confounders may have contributed to the observed dif-
ference in reemployment between smokers and nonsmokers.
Hours and Wages
Participantswhowerereemployedat1yearworkedamean(SD)
of 32 (22) hours per week, with no difference by smoking sta-
tus (F(1,82) = 1.19; P = .28). Among those reemployed at 1 year,
the hourly wage for smokers was significantly lower (mean
[SD], $15.10 [$4.68]) than for nonsmokers (mean [SD], $20.27
[$10.54]; F(1,86) = 6.50; P = .01).
Stability of Smoking
Smoking status was generally stable over time: 6 smokers
(5.7%) at baseline had quit at 12 months, while 8 baseline non-
smokers (7.4%) were smoking (5 of 8 were former smokers at
baseline). Among continued smokers, mean (SD) cigarettes per
day declined significantly over time, from 12.6 (6.3) at base-
line to 10.2 (7.4) at 12 months (paired samples tdf = 97 = 3.65;
P < .001). The reduction in cigarettes per day did not differ by
reemployment status (F1,98 = 0.05; P = .83).
Discussion
Although tobacco use has been associated with unemploy-
ment in cross-sectional population-based studies in the United
States and Europe, the mechanism and direction of that asso-
ciation has not been investigated prospectively. Our study ex-
amined the association of smoking with reemployment dur-
ing a 12-month time frame. In our primary and sensitivity PS
analyses adjusting for covariates of interest, nonsmokers had
a significant advantage in reemployment at 12 months rela-
tive to smokers.
Had we randomized participants into groups of smokers
or nonsmokers, then we would conclude that not smoking in-
creased the probability of reemployment at 12 months by 12%
to 48% on average. Given that nicotine is addictive and to-
bacco use is harmful, it would be unethical to randomize a par-
ticipant to smoke vs not smoke. Instead we prospectively
tracked the reemployment success of smokers and nonsmok-
ers in the job-seeking market. That the groups were preexist-
ing raises concern about residual confounding. We therefore
conclude that there is suggestive evidence that a causal asso-
ciation may exist between smoking status and reemploy-
ment at 12 months.
Among smokers reemployed at 1 year, on average, their
hourly income was $5 less relative to reemployed nonsmok-
ers: $15.10 vs $20.27, a 25.5% difference. Averaging 32 hours
per week, this is a deficit exceeding $8300 annually. Our find-
ings, which were self-reported among job seekers, are com-
parable with wage estimates for nonsmokers ($20.71) and
smokers ($17.48) reported by Berman et al9, based on the US
Bureau of Labor Statistics, adjusted to 2010 levels, and dis-
counted at 15.6% for smokers per a report of the Medical Ex-
penditure Panel Survey.27 Combining our estimated wage gap
with the sample’
s report of spending about $6.50 per day on
tobacco(morethan$2300peryear),thefindingssuggestacost,
on average, of more than $10 600 annually associated with to-
bacco use. With nearly 3 decades of smoking and evidence of
very low rates of quitting during this 12-month observational
study, the financial losses to smokers are significant.
An economically disadvantaged group, with most earn-
ing less than $20 000 gross in the past year (and residing in
the San Francisco Bay Area), participants reported relighting
extinguished cigarettes; a preference for menthol tobacco,
which is often priced more cheaply; purchasing single ciga-
rettes, which are illegal; and smoking cigars and cigarillos,
which are taxed at a lower rate and are available for indi-
vidual sale. Regulatory efforts to ban menthol, increase
taxes, and enforce bans on individual sales of all forms of
tobacco may help promote cessation among job-seeking
smokers. Notably, smokers in our sample prioritized tobacco

as more important than items relevant to job seeking, such
as transportation costs, cellular telephone service, and
grooming needs.
Study limitations included the exclusion criteria and
sample size, which, while powered for the main outcome, did
not allow for tests of association within career clusters. Par-
ticipants were English-literate, not intending to relocate in the
next 12 months, and residing in the San Francisco Bay Area, a
geographical location with a very low smoking prevalence and
probably unusually high stigma about smoking. As such, study
findings may not be generalizeable to all job-seeking smokers
in all regions. Although limited by its observational design, our
study yielded novel findings.
Conclusions
Employment development departments are well placed for
reaching tobacco users and addressing tobacco-related health
and economic disparities. Our research team is now testing
the effect of a tobacco cessation intervention on time to reem-
ployment in a randomized controlled trial with job-seeking
smokers. As a “one-stop shop” for employment resources, em-
ployment service agencies could raise awareness of tobacco-
related costs, wage losses, health harms, and associations with
lower reemployment success and serve as a connector to low-
cost cessation services such as state quit-lines.

Editor's Note
Employment Advice for Job-Seeking Smokers: Quit
Mitchell H. Katz, MD
When I first read the article in this issue of JAMA Internal
Medicine by Prochaska et al,1 I thought: Of course, smokers in
the San Francisco Bay area, where smoking is a highly stig-
matized behavior, are going
to have more trouble than
nonsmokers finding employ-
ment. In the supermajority world of nonsmokers, who wants
a smoker as a coworker?
However, Prochaska et al1 helped me to see that their re-
sults have a more important meaning. Their adjusted model
predicts that if all the participants in these 2 employment de-
velopment programs who were smokers became nonsmok-
ers, there would be a 24% increase in employment. There-
fore, support for smoking cessation, including referral for
cessation medications, should be a standard part of employ-
ment counseling. For smokers seeking employment, we can
add another motivation for quitting to all the health and lon-
gevity benefits of cessation: increased likelihood of finding a
job. Physicians should advise job seekers who are still smok-
ing to buff up their resume and set a quit date.
Conflict of Interest Disclosures: None reported.
