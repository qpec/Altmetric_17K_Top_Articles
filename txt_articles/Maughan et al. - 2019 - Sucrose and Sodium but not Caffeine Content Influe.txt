Abstract 
This study systematically examined the influence of carbohydrate (sucrose), sodium and caffeine on 
the fluid retention potential of beverages under euhydrated conditions, using the beverage hydration 
index (BHI) method. Three cohorts, each of 12 young, healthy, active men, ingested 1L of beverages 
containing four different concentrations of a single component (sucrose, sodium or caffeine) in a 
double blind, crossover manner. Urine output was collected for the subsequent 4-h. Cumulative urine 
output was lower and net fluid balance were higher after 10% and 20% sucrose beverages than 0% 
and 5% sucrose beverages (P<0.05), and after 27mmol/L and 52mmol/L sodium beverages than 
7mmol/L and 15mmol/L sodium beverages (P<0.05). No difference in urine output or net fluid balance 
was apparent following ingestion of caffeine at concentrations of 0 - 400 mg/l (P=0.83). Consequently, 
the calculated BHI was greater in beverages with higher sucrose or sodium content, but caffeine had 
no effect. No difference was observed in arginine vasopressin or aldosterone between any trials. These 
data highlight that the key drivers promoting differences in the fluid retention potential of beverages 
when euhydrated are energy density, likely through slowed fluid delivery to the circulation 
(carbohydrate content effect), or electrolyte content through improved fluid retention (sodium 
content effect). These data demonstrate that beverage carbohydrate and sodium content influence 
fluid delivery and retention in the 4-h after ingestion, but caffeine up to 400mg/L does not. Athletes 
and others can use this information to guide their daily hydration practices.

Introduction 
Several factors are known to affect maintenance or restoration of fluid balance. The volume 
and composition of ingested fluids are obviously key in meeting daily water needs and in restoration 
of fluid balance following exercise (Shirreffs & Maughan, 2000). Although the impact of beverage 
composition on rehydration has been studied widely over the past 25 years, it has been focused 
around restoration of fluid balance following exercise heat stress-induced dehydration. Responses to 
fluid intake under euhydrated rested conditions have not been widely explored, though a Beverage 
Hydration Index (BHI) has recently been proposed to summarise such effects (Maughan et al., 2016) 
and recently  it was demonstrated that body mass and sex do not influence the BHI (Sollanek et al., 
2018). 
Under resting euhydrated conditions, it appears that the carbohydrate, protein,   and 
electrolyte content of ingested beverages are key to influencing subsequent urine production, and 
thus fluid retention (Maughan et al., 2016). Ingested fluids with a high-energy content (such as milk 
and fruit juice), as well as those with high electrolyte content (such as milk, fruit juice, and oral 
rehydration solution (ORS)) promote longer-term retention of the ingested volume (Maughan et al., 
2016). These differences in fluid retention are likely due to mechanisms involving both fluid delivery 
to the circulation (Calbet & Holst, 2004; Mahe et al., 1992) and effect of electrolytes (particularly 
sodium) on expansion of blood volume and plasma osmolality (Heer et al., 2000). Energy content and 
osmolality of beverages are known to influence the rate of gastric emptying (Hunt & Stubbs, 1975; 
Vist & Maughan, 1994, 1995). In addition, glucose and electrolyte composition and osmolality affect 
intestinal water transport (Schedl et al., 1994; Gisolfi et al., 1992; Shi et al., 1995).  Furthermore, the 
electrolyte content of drinks also affects the retention of fluid within the extracellular or intracellular 
fluid compartments (Leiper, 2015). Diuretic agents, such as caffeine and alcohol, have little influence 
on hydration status and fluid loss/retention if taken in small quantities (Armstrong et al., 2005; 
Maughan et al., 2016; Roti et al., 2006; Seal et al., 2017; Shirreffs & Maughan, 1997). These outcomes

have potentially important implications for guidance to individuals/athletes around the ability to 
retain fluids for longer; particularly during periods when there may be limited access to beverages and 
when access to facilities for urination are restricted, e.g. when travelling. 
To date, there have been no systematic evaluations of the effect of key beverage components 
on the retention of beverages during rested euhydrated conditions. For example, the dose of caffeine 
administered is likely to be key, as doses of caffeine up to 452mg may not induce a significant diuresis 
vs. matched volumes of water in habitual caffeine users (Armstrong et al., 2005; Killer et al., 2014; 
Maughan & Griffin, 2003).  Recent evidence suggests that only high doses >500mg of caffeine may 
induce diuresis (Seal et al, 2017) but no systematic evaluation of caffeine dose on fluid balance has 
been conducted under standardized euhydrated conditions.  Furthermore, one study has examined 
the influence of carbohydrate content of drinks (3% vs 6% carbohydrate) on fluid delivery / retention 
at rest without prior exercise in mildly dehydrated participants. Over a short follow-up period of only 
1-h, no differences were noted for proportion of fluid volume retained between trials (Logan-Sprenger 
& Spriet, 2013).  A recent investigation examined the hydration potential of an amino acid based ORS, 
a glucose containing ORS and a sports drink and it was demonstrated that the electrolyte content is 
the primary driver of the fluid retention potential of beverages (Sollanek et al., 2018) . These studies 
provide some insight but did not systematically examine dose-response effects of different beverage 
components. 
Thus, to date there has been no systematic assessment of key components, such as 
carbohydrate, caffeine, and sodium content, on the ability to retain fluid of beverages under 
euhydrated conditions. 
Therefore, the objective of the present study was to explore the dose-response effects of 
individual beverage components (sodium, sucrose and caffeine) on the hydration potential of 
beverages, expressed as the BHI, when ingested under standardized euhydrated conditions. By 
characterizing the effects of these individual components, we aimed to provide further insight into

the factors that determine the BHI response.  We hypothesized that increasing the content of sodium 
and sucrose would increase the ability to retain fluid of beverages expressed as the BHI, while graded 
caffeine doses within the range commonly ingested (up to 400 mg) would have little effect. 
Methods 
General Study Design 
Three laboratories (Loughborough, Bangor and Stirling Universities) collaborated to complete 
this study. At each site, 12 healthy, weight-stable, active men aged 18-35 years were recruited (n=36 
total, Table 1, Figure 1A). Participants with a history of cardiovascular, renal, musculoskeletal, or 
metabolic diseases, as determined from a pre-participation health screen questionnaire, were 
excluded. Using the experimental approach reported previously (Maughan et al., 2016), each site 
compared the effect of a control beverage and beverages containing three levels of a single 
component on post-ingestion fluid balance; Loughborough-caffeine, Stirling-sucrose, Bangor-sodium. 
Briefly, all urine passed over the 4-h post-ingestion period was collected and expressed as a fraction 
of that on the water trial. Participants recorded their diet including fluid intake (household measures 
technique; (Marr, 1971)) and any exercise performed in a diary, over the 2-days before the first trial 
and referred to this diary to replicate this diet/fluid intake and exercise before the three subsequent 
visits.  Participants were asked not to perform any strenuous exercise or consume alcoholic beverages 
in the 24-h preceding trials. Compliance was verified verbally with the participants on arrival at the 
laboratory. Approval for the study was obtained from each of the local Ethics Committees, in 
accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (2013). All participants provided written informed consent 
before participation.  
Experimental Procedures 
Following an overnight fast of ≥ 8-h, participants emptied their bladder upon waking and 
retained an aliquot. One hour before arriving at the laboratory, volunteers ingested 500ml of still 
water (Highland Spring™, Perthshire, UK) over the course of 15min. Upon arrival in the laboratory,

volunteers remained seated for 20min. A 20G 1.25” cannula (Becton Dickinson Infusion Therapy 
Systems Inc., USA) was introduced into an antecubital vein and a blood sample was collected. 
Participants were then asked to void their bladder and bowels before measurement of body mass 
(underwear only) to the nearest 50g. Participants then steadily ingested 1L divided in 2 aliquots (every 
15min) of the assigned test beverage over a period of 30min. At the end of the 30min drinking period, 
a blood sample was drawn and participants emptied their bladder. This procedure was repeated at 
hourly intervals, until 4-h post-ingestion. Volunteers remained seated during the drinking period and 
during the post-ingestion period. Participants stood up when they were asked to empty their bladder 
or if they needed to void before the collection time point. After the final urine sample was collected, 
near-nude body mass was recorded again. (Figure 1B) 
Beverages 
The control beverage at all sites consisted of still water (Highland Spring™, Perthshire, UK) 
with added sugar-free fruit-flavoured concentrate (Tesco Stores, UK). This same beverage, with the 
addition of three levels of a single beverage component, was administered in a randomized, counter-
balanced and double-blind manner; Loughborough 50, 200 and 400mg per L of caffeine (BDH, 
Leicestershire, UK), Stirling 50, 100 and 200g per L of sucrose (British Sugar Ltd, UK), Bangor 15, 27 
and 52mmol/L of Na, as sodium chloride (Glacia Fine 60, British Salt Ltd, UK). The control beverage 
contained 7mmol/L Na and 0.8 g/L of sugar (due to the addition of fruit squash) and was chosen 
instead of plain water to blind participants to the control trial. The osmolalities of the four beverages 
administered at Loughborough were 44 (control, 0mg caffeine/L), 43 (50mg caffeine/L), 44 (200mg 
caffeine/L) and 44mOsmol/kg (400mg caffeine/L), at Stirling were 46 (control, 0.8g/L sucrose), 205 
(50g/L sucrose), 386 (100g/L sucrose) and 808mOsmol/kg (200g/L sucrose); and at Bangor were 33 
(control, 7mmol/L Na), 54 (15mmol/L Na), 85 (27mmol/L Na) and 138mOsmol/kg (52mmol/L Na). Test 
beverages were stored at a standard refrigerated temperature (4-6 °C) until serving.

Urine and blood collection, storage and analysis 
Collection, handling, and storage of urine and blood samples were undertaken in accordance 
with the Human Tissues Act. Stored samples were discarded once analysis was completed.  
All urine collected during the study was passed into a 1L plastic container. The volume of each 
urine pass was determined by measuring the mass on an electronic balance, assuming a specific 
gravity of 1.00. From each urine pass, a 5ml aliquot was collected and stored at 4˚C. Urine osmolality 
was measured using freezing-point depression method (Gonotec Osmomat, Germany at 
Loughborough and Bangor and Roehbling, Camlab, UK at Stirling) within 48-h of collection.  
11mL blood samples were drawn into dry syringes and immediately dispensed into a 5mL 
serum tube, and 1mL and 5mL EDTA tubes. At Stirling, duplicate 100 µL aliquots of whole blood were 
rapidly deproteinised in Eppendorf tubes containing 1 mL of ice-cold 0.3 N perchloric acid. These 
samples were centrifuged and the resulting supernatant used to determine blood glucose 
concentrations (Glucose oxidase method, Instrumentation Laboratory, Italy).  
Whole blood in the serum tube was allowed to stand for 1-h at room temperature to clot 
before centrifugation (10min, 4°C, 2000-3000g). Serum was dispensed and stored at 4°C for 
measurement of osmolality by freezing-point depression and sodium by flame-photometry (Bangor).  
A further serum aliquot was stored at - 80°C for measurements of aldosterone and arginine 
vasopressin concentrations by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Enzo Life Sciences, Lausen, 
Switzerland) and caffeine concentrations by HPLC (Loughborough; Holland et al., 1998)). 
Beverage hydration index (BHI) calculation  
The beverage hydration index (BHI) (Maughan, et al., 2016) was obtained by dividing the total 
urine output over a period of time for the control beverage by the total urine output for the same 
period of time after the test beverage was ingested.

Data and statistical analysis  
Participant characteristics at each institution were compared by one-way ANOVA. Pre-drink 
hydration status, as assessed by body mass, serum and urine osmolality, was compared by repeated-
measures ANOVA. For each beverage component studied the cumulative urine mass, net fluid balance 
and blood parameters were compared each hour and between different beverage doses by 2-way 
repeated-measures ANOVA. Significant main effects and interactions were further explored by Tukey’s 
multiple-comparison tests. BHI values were not normally distributed and therefore statistical 
comparison between beverages was made by Friedman test with significant effects further explored 
by Dunn’s multiple comparison tests. The meaningfulness of differences observed was calculated 
using 95% CI of differences between means and Cohen’s d effect size (Cohen, 1988).  All statistical 
analyses were completed with the use of a statistical software package (GraphPad Prism version 6 for 
Windows). Statistical significance was accepted at P<0.05. 
Sample size was based on a minimally important difference using 80% power and a two-tailed 
alpha level of 0.05. Hypothesized effect size was 0.81, calculated from the difference between 
estimated mean cumulative urine output (minimally important difference of 168mL) (Maughan, et al., 
2016) with a pooled SD of 206ml giving an estimated sample size required of n=12 per site. 
Results 
Forty participants were recruited: loss to follow-up occurred because of vomiting after 
beverage ingestion (n=2), or because of voluntary withdrawal from the study (n=2), resulting in n=36 
participants, 12 at each site. 
Pre-drink ingestion hydration status 
On each trial, pre-ingestion hydration status indicated euhydration (Table 2). The coefficient 
of variation (CV) for initial body mass was 0.6%, 0.8% and 0.6% for all sucrose, sodium and caffeine 
trials, respectively. The CV for initial serum osmolality was 0.7%, 1.0% and 0.7% for all sucrose, sodium

and caffeine trials, respectively. The CV for initial urine osmolality was 37%, 39% and 24% for all 
sucrose, sodium and caffeine trials, respectively. 
Blood glucose, serum sodium and plasma caffeine responses 
Blood glucose concentration was greater after ingesting beverages containing sucrose (Figure 
2A, P<0.01). Up to 1-h after beverage ingestion, blood glucose remained higher after the 20% sucrose 
beverage than the 0% and 5% beverages. Blood glucose was then similar between beverages for the 
remainder of the 4-h with exception of the 10% sucrose beverage being lower than the 0% and 20% 
beverages at 2-h. Serum sodium was not changed after ingesting beverages of different sodium 
contents (Figure 2B). Plasma caffeine content increased in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 2C, 
P<0.01).  
Urine output and fluid balance responses to sucrose 
Immediately after ingesting the different sucrose beverages, urine mass was similar (P=0.12). 
Cumulative urine output was lower and net fluid balance higher at 1-h, 2-h and 3-h after ingestion of 
the 10% and 20% sucrose beverages than the 0% and 5% sucrose beverages (Figures 3A & 3B, P<0.05). 
Throughout the 4-h period, cumulative urine output was lower and net fluid balance higher after the 
20% sucrose beverage than the 0%, 5% and 10% beverage (P<0.05). The effect sizes at 2-h compared 
with the 0% beverage were 1.46 for the 20% sucrose beverage and 0.73 for the 10% sucrose beverage. 
The mean differences in urine output compared with the 0% beverage were 500g (95%CI: 399, 601g) 
for the 20% sucrose beverage and 189g for the 10% sucrose beverage (95%CI: 87, 290g).  
Urine output and fluid balance responses to sodium 
One hour after ingesting different sodium beverages urine mass was similar (P = 0.30), but  2-
h, 3-h, 4-h after ingestion cumulative urine output was lower and net fluid balance higher after the 
27mmol/L and 52mmol/L sodium beverages than the 7mmol/L and 15mmol/L beverages (Figures 3C 
& 3D, P<0.05). The effect sizes at 3-h compared with the 7mmol/L beverage were 1.06 for the 
52mmol/L beverage and 0.87 for the 27mmol/L beverage. The mean differences compared with the

7mmol/L beverage were 372g (95%CI: 228, 516g) for the 52mmol/L sodium beverage and 300g 
(95%CI: 156, 444g) for the 27mmol/L sodium beverage. These differences also exceeded the 3-h 
cumulative urine output and net fluid balance CV. 
Urine output and fluid balance responses to caffeine 
Urine mass and net fluid balance were similar throughout the 4-h period on all trials after the 
ingestion of drinks with different caffeine content (Figures 3E&3F, P=0.83). 
Beverage Hydration Index 
Based on our previous observations, a calculated BHI exceeding twice the CV of the BHI index 
can be considered as meaningful, representing a better fluid retention (Maughan et al., 2016). BHI 
was greater in drinks with higher sucrose and sodium content, but was not affected by caffeine 
content (Figure 4, P<0.05). After 1-h, 2-h, 3-h and 4-h, 20% sucrose beverage had higher BHI than 
control (0% sucrose beverage) and at 2-h and 3-h was higher than 5% sucrose beverage (P<0.05). After 
2-h, 3-h and 4-h the 27mmol/L and 52mmol/L sodium beverages had higher BHI than the control trial 
(Figure 4A&4B, all differences P<0.05).  
Fluid-regulation and redistribution 
Throughout the 4-h period, concentrations of aldosterone and arginine vasopressin were 
similar irrespective of the sucrose, sodium or caffeine content of beverages (Table 3). Immediately 
after and in the first hour after ingestion of 10% and 20% sucrose content beverages, serum osmolality 
increased, and was different to control and to 5% sucrose beverage (P<0.05), while it was relatively 
unchanged and similar after 0% and 5% sucrose beverage ingestion (Figure 5A). In contrast, 
immediately after ingestion of sodium beverages, serum osmolality decreased but to a less extent of 
52mmol/L sodium beverage in comparison with the control (Figure 5B, P<0.05).  Osmolality was not 
measured in caffeine trials.

Discussion 
In the present study cumulative urine output was lower and net fluid balance higher 4-h after 
the ingestion of the 10% and 20% sucrose beverages than after the ingestion of the 0% and 5% sucrose 
beverages. A similar response was observed with 27 mmol/L and 52 mmo/L sodium beverages 
compared to the 7 mmol/L and 15 mmol/L beverages. However, no differences in urine mass or net 
fluid balance were apparent 4-h following the ingestion of different caffeine contents. These 
observations are consistent with our initial hypotheses and demonstrate that factors affecting fluid 
delivery (sucrose content) and retention (sodium content) are dependent upon the dose contained 
within ingested beverages. These data also demonstrate that caffeine up to 400 mg/L has no impact 
upon hydration potential or the ability to retain fluid of beverages.  
In our previous work (Maughan et al., 2016), we were able to quantify the hydration potential 
of commercially-available drinks using a beverage hydration index (BHI). The BHI was postulated to be 
related to energy density and electrolyte composition, both of which can affect fluid delivery and 
retention. However, combinations of key components (e.g. macronutrients, electrolytes and caffeine) 
at different doses could influence gastric emptying, intestinal absorption, and fluid retention 
characteristics. The results of the present study reveal that, in comparison to control beverage, under 
euhydrated conditions a sucrose content of up to 5%, a caffeine content of up to 400mg/L, and a 
sodium content of up to 15mmol/L all have no effect on the BHI. However, 10% and 20% sucrose 
beverages, and beverages containing 27mmol/L and 52mmol/L sodium result in reduced diuresis. 
Given that these test drinks were examined under euhydrated conditions, the reduced urine output 
likely occurred due to mechanisms involving a combination of altered gastric emptying (Hunt & 
Stubbs, 1975) and intestinal absorption (Leiper, 2015). Furthermore, the electrolyte content has 
potential effects on fluid retention independent of hormonal controls (Schedl & Clifton, 1963).

Gastric emptying, intestinal absorption and renal excretion of fluids 
Early studies demonstrated that the addition of sodium to test drinks with low glucose content 
increased the rate of gastric emptying (Hunt & Pathak, 1960) and intestinal absorption (Phillips & 
Summerskill, 1967). Other studies demonstrated that glucose at >4% solution content reduced the 
rate of gastric emptying compared to water, that warm/hot fluids reduced gastric emptying compared 
to cold beverages, and that faster initial emptying rates were reached with higher bolus volumes 
(Costill & Saltin, 1974; Hunt & Macdonald, 1954; Vist & Maughan, 1994, 1995). Applying these 
observations to the current study it can be proposed that gastric emptying rate would be increased 
with an increasing sodium content of beverages (above 33 mmol/L), reduced with an increasing 
energy/carbohydrate content (above 4-5% carbohydrate), and likely remain unchanged by increasing 
caffeine content (up to 269 mg). Indeed, these largely reflect the reported observations in the present 
study. 
Intestinal perfusion studies reveal that hypertonic solutions (>300mOsm/kg) result in 
transient net water secretion into the intestinal lumen whereas hypotonic solutions (<260mOsm/kg) 
stimulate net water absorption (Hunt et al., 1992). High carbohydrate solutions with high osmolality 
will therefore delay gastric emptying, slow delivery of fluid to the intestine, and cause net water 
secretion into the intestinal lumen. Water absorption appears to be independent of carbohydrate at 
concentrations up to 6% (Gisolfi et al., 1992). Applying these observations to the present study would 
suggest that more concentrated sucrose solutions (10%) would likely slow gastric emptying result in 
transient net water secretion into the intestinal lumen. The effect of increasing the sodium content 
upon the ability to retain fluid of beverages suggests an initial fast gastric emptying inducing increase 
in intestinal water and sodium transport, and subsequently greater retention of the fluid in the body

The principal determinant of permeability, and consequently of water reabsorption, in the 
collecting ducts of the kidneys is arginine vasopressin (AVP) (Bourque, 2010). Aldosterone, produced 
by the adrenal cortex, also stimulates sodium reabsorption in the cortical collecting ducts (Stanhewicz 
& Kenney, 2015). In the present study, the responses of aldosterone and AVP to fluid ingestion were 
similar regardless of the content of sucrose, sodium or caffeine within the beverages. AVP and 
aldosterone also did not change over time during the ingestion or follow-up period.  Thus, in the 
present work it can be concluded that differences in urine output between sucrose beverages and 
between sodium-containing beverages are not influenced by differences in renal water or sodium 
excretion. Thus, by studying participants in a euhydrated state we have been able to isolate effects on 
fluid delivery/retention while removing potential interaction of hormonal controls.  The differences in 
2-h cumulative urine output and in net fluid balance observed in the sucrose and in the sodium trials 
can be considered meaningful as they exceeded the CV calculated previously (Maughan et al., 2016) 
and the minimally important difference of 168mL calculated a priori. 
Caffeinated beverages and hydration 
Caffeine is an adenosine receptor antagonist reducing fractional sodium reabsorption in the 
proximal tubule and in the distal nephron (Shirley et al., 2002) which could lead to increased renal 
water loss. Previous studies exploring the effect of administering different doses of caffeine have 
observed increased urine volume only when participants ingested 360 mg of caffeine (Passmore et al., 
1987), 6 mg/kg of caffeine (Seal et al., 2017) or 624 mg (Neuhauser et al., 1997). In the present study, 
no difference in urine volume was noted following any of the doses of caffeine administered. This 
suggests that sodium excretion was not influenced by caffeine in our participants. Unfortunately, 
sodium excretion in urine was not determined in our trials to enable confirmation of this proposal. 
The lack of effect of all the caffeine doses studied in the present study supports and adds to earlier 
observations on caffeine dose. Thus, caffeinated beverages (containing up to 400mg of caffeine) can 
contribute to daily total fluid intake targets without negative effects on fluid balance.

Practical Perspectives / Study Limitations 
This study provides further evidence that the sodium content of a beverage is likely to be a 
main driver for improved fluid delivery and retention, while high carbohydrate content likely delays 
fluid delivery and increases the serum osmolality, and caffeine up to 400mg has no impact on diuresis 
4-h after the beverage ingestion. These mechanistic observations can provide useful information for 
athletes as their teams can develop a fluid intake strategy for when there is limited access to fluid or 
when the access to facilities to urinate is restricted (e.g. when the athletes are travelling) The 
outcomes of the present study require further exploration in other groups such as older adults who 
have a reduced ability to alter renal water excretion. Future studies also should examine the effects 
of other macro- and micro-nutrients on the hydration potential of beverages.
