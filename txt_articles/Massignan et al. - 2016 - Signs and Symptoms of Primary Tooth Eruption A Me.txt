abstract
CONTEXT: Symptoms associated with the primary tooth eruption have been extensively studied 
but it is still controversial.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the occurrence of local and systemic signs and symptoms during primary 
tooth eruption.
DATA SOURCES: Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences, PubMed, ProQuest, Scopus, and 
Web of Science were searched. A partial gray literature search was taken by using Google 
Scholar and the reference lists of the included studies were scanned.
STUDY SELECTION: Observational studies assessing the association of eruption of primary teeth 
with local and systemic signs and symptoms in children aged 0 to 36 months were included. 
DATA EXTRACTION: Two authors independently collected the information from the selected 
articles. Information was crosschecked and confirmed for its accuracy.
RESULTS: A total of 1179 articles were identified, and after a 2-phase selection, 16 studies 
were included. Overall prevalence of signs and symptoms occurring during primary tooth 
eruption in children between 0 and 36 months was 70.5% (total sample = 3506). Gingival 
irritation (86.81%), irritability (68.19%), and drooling (55.72%) were the most frequent 
ones.
LIMITATIONS: Different general symptoms were considered among studies. Some studies 
presented lack of confounding factors, no clear definition of the diagnostics methods, use of 
subjective measures and long intervals between examinations.
CONCLUSIONS: There is evidence of the occurrence of signs and symptoms during primary tooth 
eruption. For body temperature analyses, eruption could lead to a rise in temperature, but it 
was not characterized as fever.

MASSIGNAN et al 
Tooth eruption is a physiologic 
process in which teeth move 
from their development position 
within the alveolar bone to break 
the gum toward the oral cavity.1 
Nevertheless, this mechanism and 
the source of the eruptive force has 
not been established nor completely 
understood.2
Despite being a natural process 
of child development, the impacts 
of primary tooth eruption on the 
overall health of children are still 
controversial. Recent studies have 
suggested that tooth eruption 
could be accompanied by different 
benign symptoms, such as increased 
salivation, irritability, loss of appetite 
for solid foods, and rise in body 
temperature.3–11
Moreover, the eruption of 
primary teeth has been assumed 
among parents to be associated 
with behavioral and systemic 
changes.12–17 The period of time 
that tooth eruption occurs can be 
very frustrating and stressful for 
parents, especially when it happens 
to their first offspring. Many parents 
do not know how to identify the 
signs of tooth eruption in their 
children and, therefore, do not feel 
confident to relieve the discomfort 
of the child.18,19 Likewise, many 
health professionals also believe 
that there is an association between 
some signs and symptoms and the 
eruption of primary teeth. Surveys 
with pediatricians and other child 
health professionals showed that 
these beliefs are common.3,20,21 
The use of this diagnostic label may 
lead to either parents not managing 
a likely illness10 or the doctors to 
ignore significant symptoms and fail 
in diagnoses.22
Nevertheless, consistent evidence 
on the association of tooth eruption 
and general signs and symptoms 
are rather low and out of date. In a 
review conducted by Tighe et al23 
in 2007 to identify the existence 
of any pathognomonic sign and 
symptom of dental eruption, a 
variety of symptoms that may occur 
simultaneously with the tooth 
eruption was demonstrated and no 
evidence suggested the existence of 
any signs or symptoms that could 
predict the tooth eruption.
Thus, the purpose of this systematic 
review was to answer the following 
focused question: “In children aged 
0 up to 36 months, are there local or 
systemic signs and symptoms during 
the eruption of the primary teeth?”
METHODS
This systematic review was oriented 
following the Preferred Reporting 
Items for Systematic Reviews and 
Meta-Analyses protocol.24
Protocol Registration
The systematic review protocol 
was recorded at the International 
Prospective Register of Systematic 
Reviews25 under number CRD 
42015020822.
Eligibility Criteria
Inclusion Criteria
Observational studies assessing the 
occurrence of local and systemic 
signs and symptoms during the 
spontaneous eruption of primary 
teeth in healthy children aged 
between 0 and 36 months, by means 
of either clinical examination or a 
questionnaire directed to the parents 
or health care professionals, were 
included. The local and systemic 
signs and symptoms evaluated were 
all reported complications related 
to teething described in the studies 
(eg, decreased appetite, diarrhea, 
drooling, fever, inflammation, 
swelling, vesicles or ulceration of the 
gum, irritability, rash, rhinorrhea, 
sleeping disturbances, vomiting).
Exclusion Criteria
Exclusion of the studies was 
performed in 2 phases. In phase 1 
(titles and abstracts), the exclusion 
criteria were as follows: (1) studies 
conducted in children aged >36 
months old; (2) reviews, letters, 
conference abstracts; (3) studies in 
which the sample included patients 
with genetic syndromes (eg, Down 
syndrome, craniofacial anomalies, 
neuromuscular disorders); (4) 
studies in which the sample included 
malignancies, malnutrition, and 
chronic diseases; (5) studies in which 
the sample included nonspontaneous 
eruption of primary teeth; and (6) 
studies in which the eruption of 
primary teeth was not the primary 
outcome. Besides the 6 cited criteria, 
in phase 2 (full-test) the following 
exclusion criteria were added: (7) 
studies in which clinical examination 
was not performed by a health care 
professional, and (8) articles that 
evaluated the same sample.
Information Sources and Search 
Strategies
A systematic search was conducted 
on the following electronic databases: 
Latin American and Caribbean Health 
Sciences (LILACS), PubMed, ProQuest 
Dissertations and Theses Database, 
Scopus, and Web of Science, for 
titles and abstracts relevant to the 
research question. The syntax has 
been adapted to each database 
(Supplemental Appendix 1). A partial 
gray literature search was taken 
using Google Scholar limited to 
the first 100 most relevant articles 
published in the past 5 years. The 
reference lists of the included articles 
were scanned to identify additional 
studies of relevance. All references 
were managed by reference manager 
software EndNote Basic (Thomson 
Reuters, New York, NY) and duplicate 
hits were removed. The end search 
date was May 6, 2015. No language or 
date restrictions were applied.
Study Selection
The selection occurred in a 2-phase 
process to minimize bias. In phase 1, 
studies were independently screened 
by 2 reviewers (CM, MB) based 
on the titles and, if available, the 
abstracts derived from the search. 
Any study that clearly did not fulfill

the inclusion criteria was discarded. 
In phase 2, the full text of relevant 
papers was retrieved for further 
analysis by the same 2 reviewers 
(CM, MB) and was either included or 
excluded for review on the basis of 
the eligibility criteria. Disagreements 
of inclusion/exclusion were handled 
through discussion, and the third 
reviewer (MC) was consulted to 
make a final decision.
Data Collection Process
Two authors (CM, MB) independently 
collected the required information 
from the selected articles. After that, 
all the collected information was 
crosschecked and confirmed for its 
accuracy. Again, any disagreement 
was resolved by discussion and 
mutual agreement between the 
authors. The third author (MC) was 
involved, when required, to make a 
final decision.
Data Items
For all of the included studies, the 
following structured information 
was recorded: study characteristics 
(authors, year of publication, country, 
study design, setting), population 
characteristics (sample size, age 
of participants), intervention 
characteristics (type of diagnostic 
approach: clinical examination, 
body temperature, questionnaire) 
and, finally, outcome characteristics 
(assessed teeth, symptoms, mean 
temperature in noneruption days, 
mean temperature in eruption 
days, and conclusions pertaining 
to the occurrence of local and 
systemic signs and symptoms during 
the eruption of primary teeth). 
Authors were contacted for further 
details when relevant information 
was not reported or there was 
doubt remaining about duplicate 
publication.
Risk of Bias in Individual Studies
Two reviewers (CM, MB) 
independently assessed the 
methodological quality of the 
included studies, using the “Quality 
in Prognosis Studies Tool” (QUIPS).26 
The QUIPS tool comprises 6 domains: 
study participation, study attrition, 
prognostic factors measurement, 
outcome measurement, study 
confounding and statistical analysis 
and reporting to guide ratings of 
high, moderate, or low risk of bias. 
Disagreements were resolved 
through consensus when possible, or 
a third reviewer (MC) made the final 
decision.
Summary Measures
Presence of local and systemic signs 
and symptoms and differences 
in body temperature during the 
eruption of primary teeth were 
considered the main outcomes. For 
body temperature, the threshold 
point was considered according to a 
recent meta-analysis on accuracy of 
infrared tympanic thermometry,27 
between 37.4°C and 37.8°C for 
tympanic temperature and 38.0°C 
for rectal temperature. Any type of 
related outcome measurement was 
computed (categorical variables and 
continuous variables).
Synthesis of Results
A meta-analysis was planned within 
the studies presenting enough 
data. The occurrence of signs and 
symptoms of the eruption of primary 
teeth was analyzed by 2 types of 
meta-analysis, for fixed and random 
effects following the appropriate 
Cochrane Guidelines.28 Meta-
analysis was performed with the 
aid of MedCalc Statistical Software 
version 14.8.1 (MedCalc Software, 
Ostend, Belgium). Heterogeneity 
was calculated by inconsistency 
indexes (I2), and a value >50% was 
considered an indicator of substantial 
heterogeneity between studies.29 The 
significance level was set at 5%.
Risk of Bias Across Studies
Clinical heterogeneity (differences 
in participants, interventions, and 
outcomes) and methodological 
heterogeneity (study design, risk of 
bias) were explored.
RESULTS
Study Selection
The search identified 1318 citations 
across 5 databases. After duplicates 
removal, 1179 articles were screened 
in phase 1. A total of 65 articles 
met criteria for full-text screening. 
Additionally, 100 citations from 
Google Scholar were considered. 
From these, 4 further studies 
met the inclusion criteria. A hand 
search on the reference lists was 
performed for any study that might 
have been inadvertently missed by 
the electronic search procedures 
and 6 additional references were 
identified. Based on exclusion criteria 
for phase 2 (full-text screening), 59 
articles were excluded. Two articles 
evaluated the same sample and 1 was 
not found. The reasons for exclusion 
are compiled in a comprehensive 
list (Supplemental Appendix 2). 
Therefore, 16 articles were selected 
for data collection with the aim of 
answering the review question. 
A flowchart of the process of 
identification and selection of studies 
is shown in Fig 1.
Study Characteristics
Research was conducted in 8 
different countries: Australia,10,30 
Brazil,31–33 Colombia,34 Finland,35 
India,36–38 Israel,11,39,40 Senegal,41 
and United States.42,43 The sample 
size ranged widely from 1640 to 
116532 children. The search involved 
papers published between 196935,39 
and 2012.38 A summary of the study 
descriptive characteristics can be 
found in Table 1.
Risk of Bias Within Studies
The reported methodological 
quality of the included studies 
ranged between low and high risk 
of bias following QUIPS26 domains. 
Studies selected have shown to be 
heterogeneous considering bias, 7

Results of Individual Studies
There were 2 studies that 
investigated exclusively local 
modifications.30,36 Other studies 
evaluated, besides general problems, 
local disturbances that could 
be involved on primary tooth 
eruption.32,35,37,41 Hulland et al30 
observed that 85% of 128 teeth 
in 21 children presented gingival 
hyperemia in the early stages 
of eruption. Chakraborty et al36 
reported that anterior teeth erupted 
with fewer local signs than posterior. 
King et al43 suggested that local signs 
could be confound with oral herpetic 
infection.
Shapira et al40 observed an increase 
in inflammatory cytokine levels in the 
gingival crevicular fluid surrounding 
erupting teeth, whereas Galili et 
al39 found that multiple eruptions 
occurring at the same time were 
associated with diseases. Bengtson et 
al,31 Carpenter,42 Cunha et al,32 and 
Yam et al41 observed that eruption 
of primary teeth was associated 
with symptoms. Kiran et al,37 
Noor-Mohammed and Basha,38 and 
Peretz et al34 found more symptoms 
associated with the eruption of 
the incisors. Tasanen35 evaluated 
that mild symptoms like sucking 
fingers, rubbing gums, and drooling 
increased during teething, whereas 
Wake et al10 reported that primary 
tooth eruption was not associated 
with symptoms. Jaber et al11 found 
that tooth eruption in children was 
associated with fever and Ramos-
Jorge et al33 found that there was a 
slight rise in body temperature.
The frequency of body temperature 
measurement varied between 
studies. In some of them 
daily registration could be 
assessed,11,31,33,35,39 whereas in 
others every week day,10 twice 
a week,40 or monthly.42 From 
the studies in which type of 
thermometer and measurement 
were informed, 4 studies used 
rectal temperature11,35,39,42 and 
2 tympanic.10,33 In studies that 
presented these data, the cutoff 
point to consider a child with high 
temperature ranged from 37.5°C 
over a period of 2 days (rectal)39 
to 39°C in a single assessment (not 
informed).34 A summary of body 
temperature assessment can be 
found in Table 3.
In relation to individual signs and 
symptoms, some investigations 
demonstrated that fever,11,31,32, 
34,37–42 drooling,31,33–35,37 
,38,42 diarrhea,31–34,37, 38,41,42 
irritability,31–33,37,40,42 loss of 
appetite,31,33,35,37,42 sleeping 
problems,31–33,35,37 and 
rhinorrhea31–33,37,42 were associated 
with primary teeth eruption. In the 
opposite site, other studies exposed 
that the same symptoms (fever,10,35 
irritability,10 sleep disturbances,10,39 
and loose stools10,39) had no 
association with the eruption.
Synthesis of Results

studies were clustered into overall

meta-analysis11,32,34,37, 38,40, 42,43 
of general prevalence of signs and 
symptoms. Another 2 studies were 
included in the meta-analysis of 
individual signs or symptoms.33,35
Because of the heterogeneity 
between the studies, a random model 
was chosen.44 All the information 
about the meta-analysis of individual 
studies is described in Fig 2 and 
Supplemental Appendix 4. The 
results from this meta-analysis 
revealed that the overall prevalence 
of signs and symptoms associated 
with primary tooth eruption in 
children between 0 and 36 months 
was 70.5% (total sample = 3506; 
Fig 2), where gingival irritation, 
irritability, and drooling were the 
most frequent ones with 86.81%, 
68.19%, and 55.72%, respectively. 
Additional information regarding 
the meta-analysis can be found in 
Supplemental Appendices 4 and 5.
Risk of Bias Across Studies
The studies were heterogeneous 
and had different designs. Analysis 
revealed that the weakness in 
methods was not considered an 
important confounder capable 
of masking possible signs and 
symptoms related to other diseases 
that could occur simultaneously with 
primary tooth eruption.
DISCUSSION
This systematic review investigated 
the available evidence about primary 
tooth eruption and local and systemic 
signs and symptoms. Currently, 
the American Academy of Pediatric 
Dentistry guidelines have indications 
that eruption of primary teeth leads 
to local discomfort, irritation, and 
drooling.45
Parents follow the development of 
children and witness any change 
in behavior, mood, or health. Thus, 
they can be helpful in assisting in 
the detection of related problems.46 
Although cooperative, parents 
retrospectively reported symptoms 
associated with primary tooth 
eruption were memory biased. In a 
retrospective study about parents’ 
beliefs related to primary tooth 
eruption, the mean number of 
symptoms reported per child was 
11, whereas in the study sample the 
mean number was 8.10 Similarly, 
fever was reported 5 times more 
often in the retrospective than 
children experienced fever during 
teething period in the prospective 
study.33 Limitations of these studies 
are represented by the subjectivity 
of the parents’ observations. In 
this context, a study that had the 
collaboration of parents who daily 
measured children’s temperature, 
checked for tooth eruption, and kept 
a daily log of symptoms, despite 
presented adequate methods, was 
excluded based on the criteria for this 
systematic review because children 
did not receive health professional 
examination during the follow-up. 
There was a significant association 
to tooth emergence: biting, drooling, 
gum rubbing, irritability, sucking, 
sleep awakenings, ear rubbing, rash 
on face, decreased appetite for solids, 
and slight temperature elevation.6
Regarding the local signs, the most 
frequent was inflammation of 
the gum36 or gingival reddening 
(hyperemia),30 mostly in posterior 
teeth. The timing of eruption of the 
primary teeth (6 months onward) 
coincides with the age when infants 
start to explore the environment. In 
this phase, the introduction of the 
hands and objects into the mouth 
is normal; this, in turn, can bring 
harmful microorganisms and cause 
infection.47 Even sucking behavior, 
nutritive and nonnutritive, may lead 
to bruising or may traumatize the 
gums causing inflammation.48
Regarding the most frequent general 
symptoms during primary tooth 
eruption, irritability and drooling 
were the most observed followed 
by decreased appetite, sleeping 
problems, rhinorrhea, fever, diarrhea, 
rash, and vomiting. Eruption was 
associated with fever,40 did not 
influence the body temperature,35 
or leads to a slight rise in body 
temperature.33 In contrast, symptoms 
that were not related to primary 
tooth eruption in the selected studies 
were in this sequence: sickness,10,35,39 
sleeping disturbances,10,39 loose 
stools,10,39 drooling,10,39 vomiting,39 
and fever.10,35 Three of most robust 
studies in this systematic review 
showed that sucking fingers, gum 
rubbing, daytime restlessness, loss 
of appetite,35 sleep disturbance, 
increased salivation, rash, 
rhinorrhea, diarrhea, irritability,33 
and coughing40 increased during 
teething.
Another robust study,10 which 
accompanied 90 erupting teeth from 
21 children every weekday, reported 
that fever, mood disturbance, illness, 
sleeping disturbance, drooling, 
diarrhea, strong urine, red checks, or 
rashes did not have association with 
primary tooth eruption.
The stage of eruption considered 
to represent the day of eruption 
for the studies differed from the 
first day the edge of an incisor or 
a cusp of a molar could be seen or 
felt emerging through the gum,10,33 
palpable with the fingernail35; 
clinical crown of the tooth visible 
but not exceeding 3 mm of exposure 
above the gingiva34,37,38 to any 
portion of the occlusal surface 
penetrated the gingiva.39 Besides 
that, the frequency of clinical 
examination varied from single in 
cross-sectional (CS) studies to daily 
assessment in some prospective 
investigations. This is important 
information, as Hulland et al30 
found that the mean duration 
of primary tooth eruption from 
imminent eruption to completion 
of the emergence phase was in an 
average rate of 0.7 mm per month. 
Those studies that evaluated 
the eruption as the tooth crown 
visible through gingiva but not 
exceeding 3 mm or those in which 
clinical examinations occurred in

monthly intervals may have lost 
or overestimated some signs or 
symptoms.
It seems that symptoms associated 
with primary tooth eruption decrease 
with age. Most manifestations were 
observed during the eruption of 
primary incisors32,34,37,38 or were 
studied only in incisors.11,33,40 Also 
there was a significant difference 
between the mean age at which 
eruptions were accompanied by 
disturbances (11.8 months) and 
the average age (14.8 months) at 
which teeth erupted without general 
disturbances. On the other hand, 
there seems to be an association 
between multiple eruption with 
fever and respiratory and alimentary 
illnesses that could be due to the 
stress that led to the low resistance of 
the body against infections.39
Accurate determination of body 
temperature is essential to diagnose 
fever.49 A recent systematic review 
investigating the accuracy of infrared 
tympanic thermometry used in 
the diagnosis of fever in children, 
disclosed that the accuracy of this 
kind of thermometer is high, using 
rectal measurement as the “gold 
standard.” Besides, as temperature 
measured by tympanic thermometry 
was always 0.6°C to 0.2°C less than 
rectal temperature, the threshold 
of fever diagnosed by tympanic 
thermometry can be decreased. 
Therefore, if 38.0°C is the fever 
diagnosed by rectal temperature, 
the threshold of infrared tympanic 
thermometry should be 37.4°C to 
37.8°C.27 Under these circumstances, 
in this systematic review, in 1 study 
using rectal temperature, mothers 
on a daily basis verified temperature 
and the threshold point was not 
informed. Fever was associated 
with teething and the mean daily 
temperature in days of noneruption 
was between 36.90°C and 37.10°C, 
and on the eruption day 37.60°C.11 
Two studies with moderate risk 
of bias used rectal temperatures 
>37.77°C (100°F)42 and >37.50°C39; 
these authors stated that fever was 
associated with tooth eruption, 
but mean daily temperature was 
not informed. Analyzing the 3 
most robust studies, 1 used rectal 
temperature and detected that 
eruption did not interfere in body 
temperature with mean daily 
temperature in noninfected children 
(37.0°C in noneruption days and 
36.9°C in eruption days) in twice-
daily examinations.35 The others 
used tympanic measurements. One 
study discovered a slight rise from 
36.39°C in noneruption days to 
36.51°C in eruption days in a daily 
check by dentists,33 whereas the 
other stated that children do not have 
fever during the teething period, 
with 36.18°C in noneruption days 
and 36.21°C in eruption days every 
weekday by the dental therapist.10
LIMITATIONS
Some methodological limitations of 
this review should be considered. 
Different general symptoms were 
considered among studies and not all 
studies related confounding factors, 
such as other disease that might have 
occurred with tooth eruption, or 
several symptoms happening at the 
same time. All of these may obscure 
the actual findings.
Most studies failed to expose a clear 
definition of the diagnostic methods. 
Examinations were performed in 
long intervals that could compromise 
adequate data collection. Besides, 
some symptoms did not use objective 
measures, but parents’ observation, 
such as irritability and loss of 
appetite. In addition, some symptoms 
need more specific examination, 
such as diarrhea that may be caused 
by infection and, without a virology 
study the diagnostic is not conclusive.
Most of the selected studies 
demonstrated a high risk of bias, 
especially in relation to study design. 
Articles with lower risk of bias had 
small samples: 21 to 126 children 
evaluated. The biggest samples were 
found in studies with high risk of 
bias, although a random effect for 
meta-analysis was used, this might 
have affected the results.
CONCLUSIONS
Based on the current limited 
evidence, there are signs and 
symptoms during primary tooth 
eruption. Gingival irritation, 
irritability, and drooling were 
the most common. For body 
temperature analyses, it was 
possible to evaluate that eruption 
of primary teeth is associated with 
a rise in temperature, but it was not 
characterized as fever.
