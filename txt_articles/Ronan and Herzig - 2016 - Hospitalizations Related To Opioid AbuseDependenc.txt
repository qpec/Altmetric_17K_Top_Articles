Abstract
Serious infection is a recognized complication of intravenous drug abuse, and a major cause of 
morbidity and mortality in this patient population. Trends in rates and the associated cost of 
serious infections related to opioid abuse/dependence have not been previously investigated in the 
context of the US opioid use epidemic. Our study, using a nationally representative sample of U.S. 
inpatient hospitalizations, showed that hospitalizations related to opioid abuse/dependence and 
hospitalizations related to opioid abuse/dependence with associated serious infection both 
significantly increased from 2002 to 2012, respectively, from 301,707 to 520,275 and 3,421 to 
6,535. Additionally, inpatient charges for both types of hospitalizations have almost quadrupled 
over the same time period, reaching totals of almost 15 billion for hospitalizations related to opioid 
abuse/dependence and more than 700 million for those related to associated infection in 2012. 
Medicaid was the most common primary payer for both types of hospitalizations. Our results 
characterize the financial burden on the healthcare system related to opioid abuse/dependence and 
one of the more serious downstream complications of this epidemic. These findings have 
important implications for the hospitals and government agencies that disproportionately shoulder 
these costs, and for clinicians, researchers, and policy makers interested in estimating the potential 
impact of targeted public health interventions on a national level.
Introduction
Opioid abuse and addiction have plagued the United States for decades. Mortality associated 
with opioid abuse increased dramatically beginning in the 1990s, with an almost doubling of 
the incidence of opioid poisoning deaths between 1999 and 2002.[1,2] Intimately linked to 
the abuse of opioid pain relievers is the recent increase in heroin use. Between 2003 and 
2013, the number of people reporting heroin use in the past year approximately doubled 
from 314,000 to 681,000, and the rate of heroin poisoning deaths has quadrupled during the 
same time period from 2,080 to 8,257. Deaths attributable to opioids and heroin combined

 totaled 24,492 in 2013.[3,4] Furthermore, recent data indicate a shift from the exclusive use 
of prescription opioids to concurrent abuse of both heroin and prescription opioids–such 
that, almost half of patients with opioid dependence report abuse of both.[4–7]
Opioid abuse is associated with a number of potential downstream consequences, including 
serious infections related to intravenous administration, which can be associated with 
significant morbidity and mortality. The incidence and cost of these downstream infectious 
complications are relatively unexamined. Prior data suggest that the number of cases of 
infections associated with opioid use (for example, endocarditis and pyogenic spinal 
infections) has been on the rise, carrying with it substantial inpatient and long-term 
morbidity and mortality.[8–14] Unfortunately, the generalizability of existing studies 
examining opioid-related infections is limited by small sample sizes, select patient 
populations, and lack of nationally representative data.
In light of the shifting trends in prescription opioid and heroin abuse, we sought to define 
national trends in rates of inpatient hospitalizations involving serious infections in patients 
with opioid abuse/dependence and to estimate the associated morbidity, mortality, and costs, 
using a large, nationally representative data set.
Methods
Setting And Patients
We conducted a retrospective cohort study using discharge data from years 2002 and 2012 of 
the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) developed for the Healthcare Cost and Utilization 
Project (HCUP) by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. This database is the 
largest publicly available, all-payer, national inpatient database in the United States, 
representing a 20% stratified sample of all inpatient hospitalizations.
Opioid Abuse/Dependence And Associated Infection
We used International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification 
(ICD-9-CM), discharge codes to define exposures of interest, including up to fifteen codes in 
any position (primary or secondary). “Opioid abuse/dependence” was defined as any ICD-9-
CM code for abuse or dependence of opioids or heroin. “Opioid abuse/dependence with 
associated infection” was defined as any ICD-9-CM code for endocarditis, osteomyelitis, 
septic arthritis, or epidural abscess in a patient with a code for opioid abuse/dependence 
during the same hospitalization.[15]
Statistical Analysis
All reported estimates reflect national estimates, generated using the approach recommended 
by the NIS to account for the sampling design of the database and accounting for the shift in 
sampling process between 2002 and 2012 to allow comparability of estimates (using the 
recommended weight variables). We estimated the total number of hospitalizations related to 
opioid abuse/dependence and those with associated infection overall and by primary payer. 
We also estimated the incidence of the selected infections among those hospitalizations with 
and without a diagnosis of opioid abuse/dependence.

 We estimated total charges for inpatient services for hospitalizations related to opioid abuse/
dependence and those with associated infection, with and without accounting for inflation 
using the Consumer Price Index inflation calculator provided by the Bureau of Labor 
Statistics.[16] To calculate the estimated total charges per hospitalization for each of these 
conditions, we divided the total estimated charges by the number of discharges.
Finally, as a measure of the functional impact and downstream burden on the health care 
system of hospitalizations related to opioid abuse/dependence and those with associated 
infection, we report disposition, categorized as: in-hospital death, home, facility (including 
skilled nursing facilities, intermediate care facilities, and other), left against medical advice, 
and other.
We used the z-test to compare numbers of hospitalizations and charges, and the chi-square 
test to compare proportions between 2002 and 2012. We used p value < 0.05 to define 
statistical significance for all comparisons.
All analyses were conducted using SAS software, version 9.3.
Sensitivity Analyses
Because we were unable to assure that infections among patients with opioid abuse/
dependence were attributable to the opioid use itself, we performed two sensitivity analyses 
wherein we recalculated our total hospitalization estimates after restricting our cohort to 
young patients without other strong risk factors for the infections of interest. First, we 
assessed the number of hospitalizations with endocarditis in those with opioid abuse/
dependence in 2002 and 2012 after restricting our cohort to patients younger than age fifty, 
without congenital (present at birth) heart disease or preexisting mechanical valves, which 
represent inherent risks for endocarditis. In the second analysis, we assessed the number of 
hospitalizations with opioid abuse/dependence and any associated infection after restricting 
our cohort to patients younger than age fifty, without diabetes, which represents a risk for 
any infection.
Results
Total Number Of Hospitalizations
The number of hospitalizations nationally was almost identical in 2002 and 2012, as 
extrapolated from the NIS data, with an estimated 36,523,831 hospitalizations in 2002 and 
36,484,846 in 2012.
Opioid Abuse/Dependence And Associated Infection
The number of hospitalizations with a diagnosis of opioid abuse/dependence and the number 
of hospitalizations with opioid abuse/dependence with an associated infection significantly 
increased between 2002 and 2012 (Exhibit 1). These same trends were reflected for each of 
the individually specified infections–endocarditis, osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, and 
epidural abscess–with 1.5, 2.2, 2.7, and 2.6 fold increases, respectively. Because total 
hospitalizations stayed relatively constant between 2002 and 2012, standardizing estimates

 per 100,000 hospitalizations yielded the same relative increases between 2002 and 2012. See 
Appendix Exhibit B1 for standard errors associated with these estimates.[15]
The number of hospitalizations with any of the selected infections among discharges with 
opioid abuse/dependence was 3,421 out of 301,707 (1.1%) in 2002 and 6,535 out of 520,275 
(1.3%) in 2012. The number of hospitalizations with any of the selected infections among 
discharges without opioid abuse/dependence was 121,776 out of 36,222,124 (0.3%) in 2002 
and 166,405 out of 35,964,571 (0.5%) in 2012 (data not shown), demonstrating that the 
selected infections occur at an increased rate in the cohort with a concurrent opioid abuse/
dependence diagnosis.
Payer Distribution
The primary payer distribution in 2002 for both hospitalizations with opioid abuse/
dependence and hospitalizations with opioid abuse/dependence with associated infection 
was similar to the payer distribution in 2012 (Exhibit 2). The most common primary payer in 
2002 and 2012 for both groups was Medicaid. Compared to hospitalizations with opioid 
abuse/dependence overall, hospitalizations with opioid abuse/dependence with associated 
infection were more likely to be uninsured in both 2002 and 2012. See Appendix Exhibit B2 
for numeric estimates and standard errors related to insurance demographics.[15]
Total Charges
Total inpatient charges for hospitalizations related to opioid abuse/dependence more than 
tripled between 2002 and 2012 ($4,574,263,003 and $14,850,435,892, respectively, p < 
0.001) (Exhibit 3), and the increase remains significant after accounting for inflation 
($11,636,166,781 in 2012 represented in 2002 dollars, p < 0.001). Total inpatient charges for 
hospitalizations related to opioid abuse/dependence with associated infection also more than 
tripled between 2002 and 2012 ($190,678,889 and $700,663,008, respectively, p < 0.001), 
and the increase remains significant after accounting for inflation ($549,009,450 in 2012 
represented in 2002 dollars, p < 0.001). In 2012 the estimated total charge per 
hospitalization related to opioid abuse/dependence was $28,543, and opioid abuse/
dependence with associated infection was $107,217. See Appendix Exhibit B3 for standard 
errors associated with these estimates.[15]
Disposition
The distribution of disposition status in 2002 for both hospitalizations with opioid abuse/
dependence overall and hospitalizations with opioid abuse/dependence with associated 
infection was similar to the distribution of disposition status in 2012 (Exhibit 3). Although 
the most common disposition in 2002 and 2012 was to be sent home for both groups, 
hospitalizations related to opioid abuse/dependence with associated infection were more 
likely to die during hospitalization, less likely to be sent home, and more likely to be 
discharged to a second medical facility compared to hospitalizations with opioid abuse/
dependence overall, in both 2002 and 2012 (p < 0.001 for each comparison). See Appendix 
Exhibit B3 for numeric estimates and associated standard errors related to disposition status.

 Sensitivity Analyses
Among patients under age 50, without congenital heart disease or preexisting mechanical 
heart valves, the number of hospitalizations with endocarditis among hospitalizations with 
opioid abuse/dependence was 1,712 out of 244,147 (0.7%) in 2002 and 2,345 out of 347,390 
(0.7%) in 2012, while these numbers among hospitalizations without opioid abuse/
dependence were 6,689 out of 17,487,508 (0.04%) in 2002 and 8,470 out of 15,928,790 
(0.05%) in 2012. In this subpopulation without underlying risk factors for endocarditis, there 
was a 1.4 fold increase in the number of hospitalizations with opioid abuse/dependence and 
a concurrent diagnosis of endocarditis between 2002 and 2012 (1,712 in 2002 and 2,345 in 
2012, p < 0.001), virtually identical to that seen in the overall cohort.
Among patients under age 50, without diabetes, the number of hospitalizations with any 
infection among hospitalizations with opioid abuse/dependence was 2,594 out of 230,474 
(1.1%) in 2002 and 4,220 out of 318,995 (1.3%) in 2012, while these numbers among 
hospitalizations without opioid abuse/dependence were 30,027 out of 16,769,678 (0.2%) in 
2002 and 33,955 out of 14,928,754 (0.2%) in 2012. In this subpopulation without one of the 
most prevalent risk factors for infection, there was a 1.6 fold increase in the number of 
hospitalizations with opioid abuse/dependence and a concurrent diagnosis of infection 
between 2002 and 2012 (2,594 in 2002 and 4,220 in 2012, p < 0.001), again almost identical 
to that seen in the overall cohort.
Discussion
In this large, national cohort of inpatient hospitalizations, we found that both 
hospitalizations related to opioid abuse/dependence and hospitalizations related to opioid 
abuse/dependence with associated serious infection have significantly increased from 2002 
to 2012. Inpatient total charge estimates have almost quadrupled for both types of 
hospitalizations during the same time interval, reaching totals of almost $15 billion for 
hospitalizations related to opioid abuse/dependence and more than $700 million for 
hospitalizations related to associated infection in 2012. The primary payer for 
hospitalizations related to both of these conditions is Medicaid. Compared to discharges 
related to opioid abuse/dependence overall, discharges related to opioid abuse/dependence 
with infection where almost four times more costly per hospitalization, more likely to be 
uninsured, more likely to die during hospitalization, and more likely to require placement in 
a second facility after discharge. Our study provides new data on the incidence, cost, and 
outcomes of serious infections related to opioid abuse/dependence, demonstrating the 
increasing magnitude of the downstream complications associated with this epidemic.
Our finding that hospitalizations related to opioid abuse/dependence are on the rise 
nationally since 2002 is consistent with prior research that has evaluated the incidence of 
emergency department visits for nonmedical use of opioids, the rise in accidental deaths as a 
result of opioid overdose, and the increase in people using opioids and heroin illicitly.[2,17] 
Prior studies conducted using the same data source demonstrated similar hospitalization 
trends; however, those authors included nonspecific codes for “psychodysleptics” and 
“hallucinogens” in their analysis and did not investigate the incidence of infections among 
patients with opioid abuse/dependence.[4,18] Other studies have investigated infectious

 complications specifically; however, these were all small, single-center studies, mostly 
focusing on surgical patient populations.[8–14] To our knowledge, this is the first study 
demonstrating the rates, costs, and outcomes of hospitalizations related to opioid abuse/
dependence with associated infection in a national sample.
Although we are unable to definitively attribute these serious infections to opioid abuse/
dependence, there are several aspects that support such an attribution. First, the incidence of 
the selected infections in those with opioid abuse/dependence was more than double the 
incidence found among hospitalizations without opioid abuse/dependence. Second, the 
relative increase in incidence of opioid abuse/dependence with endocarditis that we observed 
between 2002 and 2012 was almost identical when focusing specifically on endocarditis in 
younger patients without other reasons for developing endocarditis, such as congenital heart 
disease or preexisting mechanical valves. The same was true when examining the incidence 
of any infection among those with opioid abuse/dependence who were young and without 
diabetes. Finally, the infections we chose all commonly require spread through the 
bloodstream, and in a patient with opioid abuse/dependence presenting with endocarditis, for 
example, it is reasonable and common practice to assume that the endocarditis is secondary 
to intravenous drug abuse.
Total charges for hospitalizations related to opioid abuse/dependence and associated 
infections have increased out of proportion to the rate of increase in number of 
hospitalizations for these conditions over the same time period, even after accounting for 
inflation. We are unable to determine the underlying cause in the present analysis, but it is 
likely multifactorial. Possibilities include increasing costs for the same care, greater resource 
use, and a higher severity of illness. That length of hospitalization declined over the time 
interval and number of procedures remained relatively constant argue against increased 
severity of illness or resource use as explanations. Future research should investigate the 
factors underlying the exponentially rising charges.
The total charges presented in this analysis reflect only inpatient charges and do not include 
the cost of post-discharge care, which is likely to be substantial, particularly in patients with 
infection. The psychosocial aspects of addiction complicate prolonged treatment courses of 
intravenous antibiotics in this patient population. Concerns over the ability to complete the 
treatment course independently and adherence to proper care instructions and use of 
indwelling intravenous catheters often require the completion of treatment in a monitored 
setting. Indeed, a larger proportion of those with a serious infection required further care in a 
skilled nursing facility when compared to those with opioid abuse/dependence overall. 
Additionally, those patients with serious infections who were discharged home likely 
incurred significant costs from home care based on the need for long courses of antibiotics 
and visiting nursing services. As such, the total cost to the health care system is substantially 
greater than the already staggering hospitalization charges demonstrated in this analysis.
Additionally, our results demonstrate that the financial burden largely falls on government-
funded agencies, patients, and hospitals because only 20% of discharges related to opioid 
abuse/dependence and 14% of discharges with associated infection were covered by private 
insurance. The high rate of uninsured status, particularly among those with associated

 infection (23% uninsured) could have implications for the care of these individuals. For 
example, patients with complex histories (medically and psychosocially) are often declined 
care at skilled nursing facilities, which leads to a longer inpatient stay and higher costs for 
those hospitalizations. These high costs in the face of a high rate of uninsured status create 
perverse incentives wherein hospitals and care organizations may seek to transfer these 
patients to other health care systems or hospitals. The potential lack of “ownership” of the 
patient’s care may exacerbate the already troubling issues related to access to care and 
follow through on follow-up care demonstrated by others.[14]
Although our study was large and nationally representative, there were a number of 
important limitations. First, our reliance on ICD-9-CM coding and individual physicians and 
coders to capture all hospitalizations for patients with these co-occurring conditions could 
have led to underestimation of the magnitude of our estimates or bias in the event of 
different coding practices in 2002 compared to 2012. Additionally, the activity status of a 
patient’s drug abuse was unknown. Furthermore, our inability to separate out intravenous 
from other routes of administration limited our ability to attribute infectious complications 
directly to opioid abuse. However, recent studies demonstrate significant interchangeability 
of prescription opioid and heroin abuse.[4–7] Additionally, since we used the same 
definition across years, comparisons across years should not be affected. Finally, our 
analyses did not account for demographic shifts in patients with opioid abuse/dependence 
between 2002 and 2012, which could have affected cost and disposition estimates.
In conclusion, the rates of hospitalizations related to opioid abuse/dependence and 
associated infection are on the rise nationally. The rise in associated inpatient charges is 
outpacing the increase in number of hospitalizations and places a significant financial 
burden on the health care system as a whole. Downstream consequences of opioid abuse/
dependence, such as related infections, are particularly costly, and a continued focus on 
decreasing access to opioids, early treatment, and preventive strategies is necessary to 
decrease the burden of disease and cost to the health care system and society.
