Background
Air travel might increase the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). It has been suggested that wearing compression stockings might
reduce this risk. This is an update of the review first published in 2006.
Objectives
To assess the effects of wearing compression stockings versus not wearing them for preventing DVT in people travelling on flights
lasting at least four hours.
Search methods
For this update the Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist (CIS) searched the Specialised Register (10 February 2016). In addition,
the CIS searched the Cochrane Register of Studies (CENTRAL (2016, Issue 1)).
Selection criteria
Randomised trials of compression stockings versus no stockings in passengers on flights lasting at least four hours. Trials in which
passengers wore a stocking on one leg but not the other, or those comparing stockings and another intervention were also eligible.
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion and extracted data. We sought additional information from trialists
where necessary.
Main results
One new study that fulfilled the inclusion criteria was identified for this update. Eleven randomised trials (n = 2906) were included in
this review: nine (n = 2821) compared wearing graduated compression stockings on both legs versus not wearing them; one trial (n =
50) compared wearing graduated compression tights versus not wearing them; and one trial (n = 35) compared wearing a graduated
compression stocking on one leg for the outbound flight and on the other leg on the return flight. Eight trials included people judged to

 be at low or medium risk of developing DVT (n = 1598) and two included high-risk participants (n = 1273). All flights had a duration
of more than five hours.
Fifty of 2637 participants with follow-up data available in the trials of wearing compression stockings on both legs had a symptomless
DVT; three wore stockings, 47 did not (odds ratio (OR) 0.10, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.04 to 0.25, P < 0.001; high-quality
evidence). There were no symptomless DVTs in three trials. Sixteen of 1804 people developed superficial vein thrombosis, four wore
stockings, 12 did not (OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.18 to 1.13, P = 0.09; moderate-quality evidence). No deaths, pulmonary emboli or
symptomatic DVTs were reported. Wearing stockings had a significant impact in reducing oedema (mean difference (MD) −4.72,
95% CI −4.91 to −4.52; based on six trials; low-quality evidence). A further two trials showed reduced oedema in the stockings group
but could not be included in the meta-analysis as they used different methods to measure oedema. No significant adverse effects were
reported.
Authors’ conclusions
There is high-quality evidence that airline passengers similar to those in this review can expect a substantial reduction in the incidence
of symptomless DVT and low-quality evidence that leg oedema is reduced if they wear compression stockings. Quality was limited by
the way that oedema was measured. There is moderate-quality evidence that superficial vein thrombosis may be reduced if passengers
wear compression stockings. We cannot assess the effect of wearing stockings on death, pulmonary embolism or symptomatic DVT
because no such events occurred in these trials. Randomised trials to assess these outcomes would need to include a very large number
of people.

Compression stockings for preventing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in airline passengers
Background
In the last few years, there has been increasing interest in whether compression stockings (or ’flight socks’) reduce the risk of deep vein
thrombosis (DVT; blood clots in the legs) and other circulatory problems in airline passengers. The stockings are worn throughout the
flight and are similar to those known to be effective in patients lying in bed after an operation. By applying a gentle pressure, to the
ankle in particular, compression stockings help blood to flow. Pressure combined with leg movement helps blood in superficial (surface)
veins to move to the deep veins and back to the heart. The blood is then less likely to clot in the deep veins, which could be fatal if the
clot moves to the lungs.
Study characteristics and key results
This review included eleven trials (2906 participants) and we were able to combine the data from nine trials with a total of 2637
participants (current to February 2016). Almost half of the participants were randomly assigned to wearing stockings for a flight lasting
at least five hours while the other half did not wear stockings.
None of the passengers developed a DVT with symptoms (slowly developing leg pain, swelling and increased temperature) and no
serious events (a blood clot in their lungs (pulmonary embolism) or dying) were reported. Passengers were carefully assessed after
the flight to detect any problems with the circulation of blood in their legs, even if they had not noticed any problems themselves.
Wearing compression stockings resulted in a large reduction in symptomless DVT among airline passengers who were allocated to wear
compression stockings compared to those allocated not to wear compression stockings. This difference in symptomless DVT between
the two groups is equivalent to a reduction in the risk from a few tens per thousand passengers to two or three per thousand. People
who wore stockings had less swelling in their legs (oedema) than those who did not wear them. Fewer passengers developed superficial
vein thrombosis when wearing compression stockings than those not wearing stockings. Not all the trials reported on possible problems
with wearing stockings but in those that did, the researchers said that the stockings were well-tolerated, without any problems.
Quality of the evidence
High-quality evidence shows that airline passengers wearing compression stockings develop less symptomless DVT and low-quality
evidence shows that leg swelling is reduced when compared to not wearing compression stockings. Quality of the evidence was limited
by the way that swelling was measured. There is moderate-quality evidence that superficial vein thrombosis may be reduced in passengers
who wear compression stockings. We cannot assess the effect of wearing stockings on death, pulmonary embolism or symptomatic

 DVT because no such events occurred in these trials. Randomised trials to assess these outcomes would need to include a very large
number of people.

 *The risk in the intervention group (and its 95% confidence interval) is based on the assumed risk in the comparison group and the relative effect of the intervention (and its
95% CI).
CI: Confidence interval; DVT: deep vein thrombosis; PE: pulmonary embolism; OR: Odds ratio
GRADE Working Group grades of evidence
High quality: We are very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect
Moderate quality: We are moderately confident in the effect estimate: The true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is
substantially different
Low quality: Our confidence in the effect estimate is limited: The true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect
Very low quality: We have very little confidence in the effect estimate: The true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of effect
1 Stockings in the nine trials included in the meta-analysis were below-knee compression stockings. In four trials the
compression strength was 20 to 30 mmHg at the ankle. It was 10 to 20 mmHg in the other four trials. One trial not included
in the meta-analysis used graduated compression tights. See Characteristics of included studies for details.
2 If there are very few or no events and the number of participants is large, judgement about the quality of evidence (particularly
judgements about precision) may be based on the absolute effect. Here the quality rating may be considered ’high’ if the
outcome was appropriately assessed and the event, in fact, did not occur in 2821 studied participants.
3 Two trials recruited high-risk participants defined as those with previous episodes of DVT, coagulation disorders, severe
obesity, limited mobility due to bone or joint problems, neoplastic disease within the previous two years, large varicose veins
or, in one of the studies, participants taller than 190 cm and heavier than 90 kg. The incidence for seven trials that excluded
high-risk participants was 1.45% and the incidence for the two trials that recruited high-risk participants (with at least one risk
factor) was 2.43%. We have rounded these off to 10 and 30 per 1000 respectively.
4 Downgraded by one level - the confidence interval crosses no difference and does not rule out a small increase.
5 Downgraded by two levels - the measurement of oedema was not validated or blinded to the intervention. All of these studies
included in the meta-analysis were conducted by the same investigators.
6 In Hagan 2008, oedema was measured by calculating the change in ankle circumference before and after landing; stockings
versus no stockings. Loew 1998 used a clinical scale and between-individual comparison as the passengers wore a stocking
on one leg only.

Description of the condition
Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) occurs where there is a partial or
total blockage of the deep venous system of the body by blood
clot, usually in the legs. The symptoms of DVT do not usually
develop immediately and diagnosis can be problematic (Anand
1998). However, typical signs and symptoms of DVT, and associ-
ated superficial thrombophlebitis (tenderness caused by inflamed
veins), may include redness of the lower legs, a swollen or painful
calf or thigh, fever and discolouration of the skin over the affected
area. If left untreated, people with DVT are at risk of developing
a pulmonary embolism (when part of the clot/thrombus breaks
away and lodges in the lungs), which can be fatal. In a review of
medical records, for a population-based inception cohort of 2218
patients in Minnesota who had a DVT or pulmonary embolism
between 1966 and 1990, Silverstein et al concluded that the an-
nual incidence of DVT was 48 per 100,000 people and the figure
for pulmonary embolism was 69 per 100,000 (Silverstein 1998).
More recent articles report incidence rates for leg DVT alone rang-
ing from 45 to 117 per 100,000 person-years (Cannegieter 2006;
Heit 2016; Tagalakis 2013).
Venous thrombosis related to air travel was first reported in 1954
in a 54-year old doctor, who developed DVT following a 14-hour
flight (Homans 1954). In 1977, Symington called this condition
’economy class syndrome’, believing that prolonged sitting in con-
fined conditions was a major factor in developing venous throm-
bosis (Symington 1977). Recent publications report the risk of
venous thromboembolism (VTE) is increased 1.5 to 3 fold (Timp
2015), by approximately two fold (Cannegieter 2006; WRIGHT
project 2007), or four fold (Kuipers 2007), following long-haul
travel. Kuipers and colleagues also reported that the “absolute risk
of a symptomatic event within 4 weeks of flights longer than 4 h is
1/4600 flights” and “the risk of severe pulmonary embolism (PE)
occurring immediately after air travel increases with duration of
travel, up to 4.8 per million in flights longer than 12 h” (Kuipers
2007).
A number of factors have been suggested as possible causes of any
increase in the risk of developing DVT when flying (Adi 2003).
These can be classified as:
• travel-related: for example, prolonged immobilisation in
narrow economy class seats with limited leg room, insufficient
fluid intake, dehydration and low humidity (Giangrande 2001;
Milne 1992); coagulation activation caused by immobilisation
(Kuipers 2007),
• person-related: for example, hereditary or acquired
prothrombotic clotting disorders, previous DVT, older age,
recent surgery or trauma (particularly orthopaedic), cancer,
smoking, pregnancy, chronic heart disease, obesity, extremes of
height and use of oral contraceptives (Bihari 2001; Cannegieter
2006; Geroulakos 2001; Landgraf 1999).
Description of the intervention
It has been suggested that the use of compression stockings during
long-haul flights may help to reduce the risk of developing DVT.
It has also been suggested that standing up or walking around
occasionally in flight, drinking plenty of water and performing
leg-stretching exercises may also help to reduce a person’s risk
(Geroulakos 2001). Aspirin and low-dose heparin have also been
suggested as preventative strategies (Giangrande 2001). Another
Cochrane review examines the effects of graduated compression
stockings in patients at risk of developing DVT in hospitalised
patients (Sachdeva 2014). The review analysed 19 randomised tri-
als and showed that graduated compression stockings are effective
in reducing the risk of developing DVT in hospitalised patients.
Furthermore, a review of observational studies on the relationship
between air travel and DVT also included a systematic review of
randomised trials to prevent DVT. The reviewers did their search
in September 2002 (Adi 2003) and found two randomised trials
of wearing versus not wearing compression stockings (LONFLIT
2; Scurr 2001).
How the intervention might work
Compression stockings are thought to reduce the risk of DVT by
exerting graduated pressure on the leg, with the pressure being
greatest at the ankle. This, when combined with muscular activ-
ity in the limb, is thought to displace blood from the superficial
venous system to the deep venous system. This, in turn, reduces
blood stasis that can lead to clotting and increases the velocity and
volume of blood flow in the deep venous system, thereby poten-
tially preventing thrombosis (Sachdeva 2014).
Why it is important to do this review
There has been increased research interest in the issue of DVT in
airline passengers in recent years. For example, as well as the re-
view by Adi 2003 and Adi 2004 and another by Ansari 2005, the
World Health Organization announced the launch of a research
programme to investigate the relationship between air travel and
venous thrombosis in May 2002 (WHO 2002). The findings of
this report show that the increased risk of VTE observed in passen-
gers on long-haul flights is due to extended periods of immobility.
As the number of people taking long-haul flights is increasing, and
as these passengers will have known or unknown thrombosis risk
factors, they concluded that “air travel-related VTE is an impor-
tant public health issue” (WRIGHT project 2007).

Compression stockings for preventing deep vein thrombosis in airline passengers (Review)

 To assess the effects of wearing compression stockings versus not
wearing them for preventing DVT in people travelling on flights
lasting at least four hours.

Criteria for considering studies for this review
Types of studies
Randomised trials that compare people wearing compression
stockings versus people not wearing them during flights lasting at
least four hours. Randomised trials in which people wore a stock-
ing on one leg and not the other are included for any leg-specific
outcomes but are not eligible for any meta-analyses of outcomes
(such as pulmonary embolism (PE) and death). This is because it
would not be possible to know which leg had contributed to the
particular outcome.
Types of participants
Any passenger on a flight of more than four hours’ continuous
duration. This includes people of both sexes, all ages, all risk fac-
tors, irrespective of any other interventions they may have used
for the prevention of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Flights in any
direction are eligible, as are both daytime and night-time flights.
Types of interventions
The primary analyses are of unconfounded randomised trials in
which the only difference between the groups is the allocation to
wear, or not wear, compression stockings. This includes trials in
which no other form of prevention was used, and trials in which
other forms of prevention were available equally to both groups.
If confounded randomised trials, in which some people were al-
located to wear stockings and other people were allocated to an
alternative form of prevention, had been found (none were), sub-
sidiary analyses would have been performed for these.
Types of outcome measures
Primary outcomes
• Diagnosis of symptomatic or symptomless DVT (by
ultrasound, venogram or isotope)
Secondary outcomes
• Diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (by ventilation
perfusion lung scan, pulmonary angiogram, spiral computed
tomography (CT) scanning, or postmortem examination)
• Death
• Superficial vein thrombosis
• Oedema
• Adverse effects arising from the use of compression
stockings
Search methods for identification of studies
Electronic searches
For this update the Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist
(CIS) searched the Specialised Register (10 February 2016). In
addition the CIS searched the Cochrane Register of Studies (CRS)
www.metaxis.com/CRSWeb/Index.asp (CENTRAL (2016, Issue
1)). See Appendix 1 for details of the search strategy used to
search the CRS. The Specialised Register is maintained by the
CIS and is constructed from weekly electronic searches of MED-
LINE, Embase, CINAHL, AMED, and through handsearching
relevant journals. The full list of the databases, journals and con-
ference proceedings which have been searched, as well as the
search strategies used, are described in the Specialised Register sec-
tion of the Cochrane Vascular module in the Cochrane Library (
www.cochranelibrary.com).
The following trial databases were searched by the CIS (10 Febru-
ary 2016) for details of ongoing and unpublished studies:
• World Health Organization International Clinical Trials
Registry (apps.who.int/trialsearch/)
• ClinicalTrials.gov (clinicaltrials.gov/)
• ISRCTN Register (www.isrctn.com/)
See Appendix 2 for details of the search strategy used.
Searching other resources
We checked the bibliographies of relevant studies and reviews
identified by the search to check for any additional trials. We also
checked the website of the World Health Organization (WHO) (
www.who.int/), for information on the ongoing WHO Research
into Global Hazards of Travel project (WRIGHT project 2007).
Data collection and analysis
Selection of studies
For this update, two review authors (CB and MC) screened the
titles and abstracts of all retrieved records to identify obvious ex-
clusions (i.e. records that were found by our electronic searches but
8

 were clearly irrelevant to this review). We obtained full copies for
reports that might relate to eligible studies and two review authors
(CB and MC) assessed these to determine if they met the inclusion
criteria for the review. CB and MC resolved any disagreements
through discussion.
Data extraction and management
Using a pre-specified data extraction form, CB performed data
extraction and MC confirmed this independently. Information
extracted included:
• descriptive data for the people in the trial (including age,
sex and all reported risk factors);
• details of the interventions (including type of compression
stocking; the duration, direction and time of day of the flight;
and any additional interventions for the prevention of deep vein
thrombosis or confounding interventions);
• outcomes, as described in Types of outcome measures
above.
Assessment of risk of bias in included studies
One review author (CB) and a member of the Cochrane Vascular
editorial base (MS) independently evaluated all included studies
for quality, using Cochrane’s tool for assessing risk of bias (Higgins
2011). This tool provides judgements made on six domains, which
include randomisation sequence generation, allocation conceal-
ment methods, blinding (participants, personnel and outcome as-
sessors), incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting,
and any other relevant biases. The two investigators performed
evaluations of low risk, unclear risk, or high risk for each domain
for every included study and resolved any disagreements through
discussion.
Measures of treatment effect
For dichotomous outcomes we calculated odds ratios (ORs) with
95% confidence intervals (CIs). For continuous data, we planned
a meta-analysis using mean differences (MD) with standard devi-
ations (SDs) and 95% CIs.
Unit of analysis issues
The unit of analysis for this review was the individual participant.
One trial randomly allocated passengers to wear a stocking on one
leg during an outward flight and on the other leg on the return
journey. Only leg-specific outcome data were used in this case.
Dealing with missing data
We based analysis on an intention-to-treat basis and therefore all
randomised participants of interest from the included studies were
to be included in the analysis. Where data were missing, we in-
vestigated if these were described within the reports and if evenly
distributed between the groups.
Assessment of heterogeneity
Statistical heterogeneitywasassessedboth visuallywithin the forest
plots and by using the I² statistic as described in Chapter 9 of
Higgins 2011. Heterogeneity was taken to be substantial with an
I² value of 50% to 75% and considerable with an I² value of 75%
or more.
Assessment of reporting biases
If sufficient trials had been identified we intended to assess report-
ing bias using a funnel plot. As fewer than 10 studies reported on
any one outcome this was not possible for this 2016 update.
Data synthesis
The decision about whether or not to combine the results of in-
dividual studies depended on an assessment of heterogeneity. The
studies were assessed for homogeneity of study design and when
they were judged to be sufficiently homogeneous in their design,
a meta-analysis was carried out and the statistical heterogeneity
was assessed. The preferred statistical analysis was the OR and the
fixed-effect model, using the statistical software in Cochrane’s Re-
view Manager software (RevMan), but other analyses were consid-
ered in the light of the very low event rates in the included studies.
If considerable heterogeneity was detected we planned to use the
random-effects model.
As noted above, unconfounded trials (i.e. allocation to wearing
stockings versus not wearing them with no other differences be-
tween the groups) would have been analysed separately from con-
founded trials (i.e. allocation to wearing stockings versus another
intervention), if any of the latter had been found (none were
found).
Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity
If sufficient data had been available, subgroup analyses would have
been performed separating participants into different groups on
the basis of risk of DVT and into different time periods following
the flight, with the main focus of the analyses expected to be
the period within one week of the flight. However, no data were
available from the trials for outcomes measured beyond this period
of follow-up.
Sensitivity analysis
We carried out sensitivity analysis using both RevMan and Stata,
to determine if the results of the meta-analysis were robust due to
the small or low overall event rate in some of the included trials.
Summary of findings
A table summarising the best evidence of relevant outcomes was
constructed for comparison of compression stockings versus not
wearing compression stockings. Study populations consisting of
9

 passengers at low or medium risk and high risk of developing
DVTs were considered. The most important and clinically rele-
vant outcomes (both desirable and undesirable) that were thought
to be essential for decision-making were selected for the Summary
of findings for the main comparison. These are described in the
Types of outcome measures and include symptomatic and symp-
tomless DVT; PE; death; superficial vein thrombosis; oedema and
adverse effects from the use of compression stockings. Assumed
control intervention risks were calculated by the mean number
of events in the control groups of the selected studies for each
outcome. The system developed by the GRADE working group
was used for grading the quality of evidence as high, moderate,
low and very low, based on within-study risk of bias, directness
of evidence, heterogeneity, precision of effects estimates, and risk
of population bias (GRADE 2004). We used GRADEpro (grade-
pro.org) software to create the ’Summary of findings’ table.

Included studies
For this update we included one additional study: Hagan 2008.
Therefore in total we identified 11 randomised controlled trials
with a combined total of 2906 participants that were eligible for
this review (Hagan 2008; Loew 1998; LONFLIT 2; LONFLIT
4 - Kendall 1; LONFLIT 4 - Kendall 2; LONFLIT 4 - Scholl 1;
LONFLIT 4 - Scholl 2; LONFLIT 4 - Traveno 1; LONFLIT 4 -
Traveno 2; LONFLIT 5; Scurr 2001).
There were 10 unconfounded trials in which participants were
allocated to either wear stockings on both legs or neither (Hagan
2008; LONFLIT 2; LONFLIT 4 - Kendall 1; LONFLIT 4 -
Kendall 2; LONFLIT 4 - Scholl 1; LONFLIT 4 - Scholl 2;
LONFLIT 4 - Traveno 1; LONFLIT 4 - Traveno 2; LONFLIT 5;
Scurr 2001). Eight of these trials were part of the LONFLIT series
of studies into the incidence and prevention of DVT in air travel.
These studies were done by an international group of researchers,
with investigators in Pescara (Italy), London and Melbourne; fur-
ther details about the group are available in the articles referenced
in this review.
Six of the studies were different parts of LONFLIT 4 (LONFLIT

 4 - Kendall 1; LONFLIT 4 - Kendall 2; LONFLIT 4 - Scholl 1;
LONFLIT 4 - Scholl 2; LONFLIT 4 - Traveno 1; LONFLIT 4
- Traveno 2). The other four trials were LONFLIT 2, LONFLIT
5 and the trials by Scurr 2001 and Hagan 2008. See the
Characteristics of included studies for details.
A total of 2871 participants were randomised in the 10 uncon-
founded trials identified. Eight of the trials recruited a total of
1598 participants who were judged to be at low or medium risk
of a DVT (Hagan 2008; LONFLIT 4 - Kendall 1; LONFLIT
4 - Kendall 2; LONFLIT 4 - Scholl 1; LONFLIT 4 - Scholl 2;
LONFLIT 4 - Traveno 1; LONFLIT 4 - Traveno 2; Scurr 2001).
These studies excluded passengers with previous episodes of DVT,
coagulation disorders, limited mobility due to bone or joint prob-
lems, neoplastic disease, varicose veins or participants taller than
190 cm and heavier than 90 kg, those advised to wear graduated
compression tights in flight, or on medication for cardiovascular
disease, diabetes or hypertension. The other two trials recruited a
total of 1273 high-risk participants (LONFLIT 2; LONFLIT 5).
LONFLIT 5 excluded participants taller than 190 cm, or weighing
more than 90 kg, or having recent/presence of thrombosis, severe
bone, joint, or mobility problems, severe hypertension, or clinical
disease requiring treatment. The exclusion criteria of LONFLIT
2 were not clear. The LONFLIT trials were reported to have been
conducted during 2001 to 2003. The Scurr trial was described as
ongoing in a report published in early 2001 (Scurr 2001a); but
the actual start and finish dates for recruitment were not reported
(Scurr 2001b). Hagan 2008 was conducted between April and
October 2006. In all the trials the flight duration was at least five
hours and passengers allocated to wear stockings were told to wear
these for the duration of the flight. In the LONFLIT 2 trial, par-
ticipants were advised to put the stockings on 6 to 10 hours before
the flight. In the other trials they were advised to put them on
within a few hours before the flight.
All unconfounded trials, except Hagan 2008, assessed incidence of
symptomless DVT within a few days of the flight but information
on the assessment of symptomatic DVT, pulmonary embolism
and death is not reported for all of them. Symptomless DVT was
assessed by ultrasound (LONFLIT 2; LONFLIT 4 - Kendall 1;
LONFLIT 4 - Kendall 2; LONFLIT 4 - Scholl 1; LONFLIT 4
- Scholl 2; LONFLIT 4 - Traveno 1; LONFLIT 4 - Traveno 2;
Scurr 2001) or D-dimer testing and fibrinogen tests (LONFLIT
5).
Nine trials used below-knee compression stockings (LONFLIT 2;
LONFLIT 4 - Kendall 1; LONFLIT 4 - Kendall 2; LONFLIT
4 - Scholl 1; LONFLIT 4 - Scholl 2; LONFLIT 4 - Traveno
1; LONFLIT 4 - Traveno 2; LONFLIT 5; Scurr 2001). In four
trials the compression strength was 20 to 30 mm Hg at the ankle
(LONFLIT 2; LONFLIT 4 - Kendall 1; LONFLIT 4 - Kendall
2; Scurr 2001). The compression strength was 10 to 20 mmHg
in a further five trials (LONFLIT 4 - Scholl 1; LONFLIT 4 -
Scholl 2; LONFLIT 4 - Traveno 1; LONFLIT 4 - Traveno 2;
LONFLIT 5). Hagan 2008 used full leg length stockings (tights)
with compression strength of about 5 mmHg at the ankle, 17 to
20 mmHg at the calf, 10 mmHg above the knee and 4 mmHg at
the buttocks.
In addition to the 10 unconfounded trials, we found one trial (n
= 35) in which participants were randomly allocated to wear a
stocking on one leg during an outward flight and on the other leg
on the return journey. This trial used class II compression stock-
ings, with the flights lasting approximately 14.5 hours. Partici-
pants were also randomised to receive dried vine leaves (Antistax)
versus diuretics versus no drugs. However, owing to the strong
effect of the diuretics on the outward flight, these were not used
on the return journey and results of the effects of the stocking on
the return flight were reported for the nine patients this affected
(Loew 1998).
We also identified two conference abstracts for studies from the
LONFLIT group which reported on research involving 420 high-
risk participants comparing stockings versus low molecular weight
heparin versus control (Belcaro 2002a), and 400 high-risk par-
ticipants comparing aspirin versus low molecular weight heparin
versus low molecular weight heparin and stockings versus control
(Belcaro2002b). However, correspondence with the first author of
these abstracts, Gianni Belcaro, in 2005 suggests that the relevant
data from these comparisons have been used within our analyses
for the LONFLIT trials described above.
Excluded studies
No additional studies were excluded for the 2016 update. One
trial was excluded previously as it was not randomised (Iwama
2002).

 All 11 trials were described as randomised but only Hagan 2008
provided sufficient information to be judged as being at low risk of
selection bias (Hagan 2008; Loew 1998; LONFLIT 2; LONFLIT
4 - Kendall 1; LONFLIT 4 - Kendall 2; LONFLIT 4 - Scholl
1; LONFLIT 4 - Scholl 2; LONFLIT 4 - Traveno 1; LONFLIT
4 - Traveno 2; LONFLIT 5; Scurr 2001). All 11 trials were at
high risk of bias as they did not blind the participants to which
group they had been randomised. All trials reported some losses
to follow-up mostly due to poor compliance or flight connection
problems.
Allocation
Only Hagan 2008 was judged as being at low risk of bias for ran-
dom sequence generation and allocation concealment. Scurr 2001
was judged as being at low risk of allocation concealment but did
not provide adequate information on the randomisation method
used. All the remaining trials provided insufficient information on
these domains and were therefore assessed as being at unclear risk
of selection bias (Loew 1998; LONFLIT 2; LONFLIT 4 - Kendall
1; LONFLIT 4 - Kendall 2; LONFLIT 4 - Scholl 1; LONFLIT
4 - Scholl 2; LONFLIT 4 - Traveno 1; LONFLIT 4 - Traveno 2;
LONFLIT 5).
Blinding
Given the intervention was to wear or not wear a compression
stocking or stockings it was not possible to blind the passengers.
All studies were assessed as being at high risk of performance bias
given the subjective nature of some of the outcomes. Blinding
of outcome assessment was not described in eight studies. Scurr
2001 described adequate blinding techniques for DVT detection
only and so was assessed as being at low risk of detection bias for
this outcome, but unclear overall. Hagan 2008 was at high risk of
detection bias as outcomes were self-reported. The remaining nine
trials did not describe outcome assessment in sufficient detail and
so were at an unclear risk of detection bias (Loew 1998; LONFLIT
2; LONFLIT 4 - Kendall 1; LONFLIT 4 - Kendall 2; LONFLIT
4 - Scholl 1; LONFLIT 4 - Scholl 2; LONFLIT 4 - Traveno 1;
LONFLIT 4 - Traveno 2; LONFLIT 5).
Incomplete outcome data
See the table ’Characteristics of included studies’ for details on
losses to follow-up in each trial. In summary, all trials reported
losses to follow-up, largely due to poor compliance or flight con-
nection problems. Outcome data were typically unavailable for
less than 10% of participants, with only LONFLIT 4 - Traveno
2 (19 of 165, 12%) and Scurr 2001 (31 of 231, 13%) reporting
higher losses than this in trials of wearing stockings on both legs
versus neither but numbers were similar between the treatment
and control groups. In LONFLIT 2, 52 of 885 (6%) of partici-
pants were lost to follow-up but it is not clear if these were evenly
distributed between the groups, so LONFLIT 2 was given a high
risk of bias judgement.
Selective reporting
Ten included studies reported on all the expected outcomes and
were judged as being at low risk of reporting bias (Hagan 2008;
Loew 1998; LONFLIT 2; LONFLIT 4 - Kendall 1; LONFLIT
4 - Kendall 2; LONFLIT 4 - Scholl 1; LONFLIT 4 - Scholl 2;
LONFLIT 4 - Traveno 1; LONFLIT 4 - Traveno 2; LONFLIT
5). Scurr 2001 did not pre-specify what outcomes they would
measure and only reported on DVT. This domain was therefore
assessed as being at an unclear risk of bias.
Other potential sources of bias
A gender imbalance between the compression stockings and no
compression stockings group (70% female versus 53% respec-
tively) was reported in Scurr 2001. It is not clear if this could affect
the outcomes. No other potential sources of bias were identified.
Effects of interventions
See: Summary of findings for the main comparison
Compression stockings compared with no compression stockings
for people taking long haul flights
Symptomatic deep vein thrombosis
None of the 2821 participants in the nine trials of wearing com-
pression stockings on both legs versus neither were reported to
have developed a symptomatic DVT. Hagan 2008 did not report
on this outcome.
Symptomless deep vein thrombosis
Of the 2821 participants randomised into the nine trials of wear-
ing compression stockings on both legs versus not wearing them,
follow-up data were available for 2637 (LONFLIT 2; LONFLIT
4 - Kendall 1; LONFLIT 4 - Kendall 2; LONFLIT 4 - Scholl 1;
LONFLIT 4 - Scholl 2; LONFLIT 4 - Traveno 1; LONFLIT 4
- Traveno 2; LONFLIT 5; Scurr 2001). Among these, 50 people
were reported to have developed a symptomless DVT, which was
detected by the investigations done within the trials, either using
ultrasound or D-dimer testing and fibrinogen tests. Three of these
people had been allocated to wear stockings and the remaining 47
people were not wearing stockings.
15
Compression stockings for preventing deep vein thrombosis in airline passengers (Review)

 In three of the nine trials, no symptomless DVTs were found in
any of the participants, regardless of whether they wore compres-
sion stockings or not (LONFLIT 4 - Kendall 1; LONFLIT 4 -
Traveno 1; LONFLIT 4 - Traveno 2). The overall incidence of
symptomless DVT was 2.43% in the two trials that recruited high-
risk participants (29 among the 1191 participants with follow-up,
distributed as follows: three in the compression stockings group
and 26 in the no compression stockings group) and 1.45% in the
seven trials that recruited people judged to be at low or medium
risk (21 among the 1446 participants with follow-up: two in the
compression stockings group and 19 in the no compression stock-
ings group).
There was no evidence of statistical heterogeneity among the re-
sults of the trials and the combined estimate of the effect of wear-
ing compression stockings versus not wearing them is an OR of
0.10 (95% CI 0.04 to 0.25, P < 0.001, high-quality evidence).
However, because of the very low overall event rate, the fact that
some trials had zero events and the fact that some trials had a small
number of events in one group and none in the other, we explored
the stability of this result depending upon the assumptions made
when calculating estimate of effect.
The default method used to calculate an OR in RevMan is the
Mantel-Haenszel method, which adds a continuity correction of
0.5 to groups in which there were no events. This may be too
high for the present circumstances. Statistical work on continuity
corrections in meta-analyses of sparse data has concluded that the
“Mantel-Haenszel summary estimates using the alternative conti-
nuity correction factors gave the least biased results for all group
size imbalances. Logistic regression was virtually unbiased for all
scenarios and gave good coverage properties. The Peto method
provided unbiased results for balanced treatment groups but bias
increased with the ratio of the study arm sizes. The Bayesian fixed-
effect model provided good coverage for all group size imbalances.
The two alternative continuity corrections outperformed the con-
stant correction factor in nearly all situations. The inverse variance
method performed consistently badly, irrespective of continuity
correction used.” (Sweeting 2004).
It is not possible to explore this further using the statistical tools
available in RevMan so we performed sensitivity analyses using
Stata, using the Mantel-Haenszel method with various small con-
tinuity corrections, logistic regression and the Peto method for
comparison. These special analyses were done using data from an
earlier version of our meta-analysis that had slightly fewer events
and a smaller number of participants from the LONFLIT 5 trial,
and an overall estimate of effect of 0.07 (0.02 to 0.22). However,
the general finding that the choice of analysis technique makes
little important difference to the overall conclusions would still
hold. The recalculated ORs using the Mantel-Haenszel method
converged to a steady level of 0.04 (95% confidence interval 0.01
to 0.18) as the continuity correction was diminished to zero. This
was identical to the one obtained using logistic regression. The
result using the Peto method was 0.15 (95% confidence interval
0.09 to 0.28, P < 0.001).
Pulmonary embolism
None of the 2821 participants in the nine trials of wearing stock-
ings on both legs versus neither were reported to have developed
a pulmonary embolism. Hagan 2008 did not report on this out-
come.
Death
None of the 2821 participants in the nine trials of wearing stock-
ings on both legs versus neither were reported to have died. Hagan
2008 did not report on this outcome.
Superficial vein thrombosis
Eight trials (1804 participants with follow-up) assessed superficial
vein thrombosis (LONFLIT 4 - Kendall 1; LONFLIT 4 - Kendall
2; LONFLIT 4 - Scholl 1; LONFLIT 4 - Scholl 2; LONFLIT
4 - Traveno 1; LONFLIT 4 - Traveno 2; LONFLIT 5; Scurr
2001). Sixteen people developed superficial vein thrombosis: four
in the compression stockings group and 12 in the no compression
stockings group. The OR was non-significant: 0.45 (95% CI 0.18
to 1.13, P = 0.09; participants = 1804; studies = 8; I² = 38%;
moderate-quality evidence). All four in the compression stockings
group were in the Scurr2001 trial, which noted that these occurred
in varicose veins in the knee region which were compressed by
the upper edge of the stocking (Scurr 2001b). No superficial vein
thromboses were found in the control group of the Scurr 2001
trial.
Oedema
Of the included studies, only Hagan 2008, Loew 1998 and the
LONFLIT 4 trials reported assessments of leg oedema (LONFLIT
4 - Kendall 1; LONFLIT 4 - Kendall 2; LONFLIT 4 - Scholl 1;
LONFLIT 4 - Scholl 2; LONFLIT 4 - Traveno 1; LONFLIT 4 -
Traveno 2). The six separate randomised LONFLIT comparisons
measured oedema using a score based on oedema tests, ankle cir-
cumference and volume, and swelling and discomfort as assessed
by the participant. The score had a maximum (worst) value of
10 and was assessed before and after the flight. Within each com-
parison, the randomised groups had similar oedema scores before
the flight (mean values of approximately 1), and the final values
(rather than a change score) are used in our analyses. These final
values were approximately 2 or 3 for people in the compression
stockings group, compared to 6 to 9 in the group allocated not
to wear compression stockings. As reported by the trialists, each
of the randomised comparisons showed a significant reduction in
oedema in their own right, both on objective measures and on
subjective measures reported by the participants. In each compar-
ison, there was a small increase in oedema for participants in the
16

 compression stockings group but a much larger increase for the no
compression stockings group. The longer flights showed the great-
est differences between the randomised groups. When combined,
although there is significant heterogeneity among the results of the
individual comparisons, the overall result clearly indicates a large
and significant benefit for passengers who were allocated to wear
compression stockings, compared to those allocated not to wear
them (mean difference (MD) −4.72, 95% CI −4.91 to −4.52;
participants = 1246; studies = 6; I² = 92%; P < 0.001; low-quality
evidence).
In the Hagan 2008 trial, oedema was measured by calculating
the change of ankle circumference (before and after landing) be-
tween those wearing compression stockings versus those not wear-
ing compression stockings. Hagan 2008 reported that there was
a decrease in ankle swelling compared with not wearing compres-
sion stockings (MD −0.19 cm, 95% CI −0.33 to −0.065 cm; P
= 0.012).
The Loew trial also studied oedema, within its randomised be-
tween-individual comparison of wearing a compression stock-
ing on one leg only (Loew 1998). These trialists assessed clinical
oedema using a three point scale: 1 = none; 2 = slight; 3 = definite.
They found that the leg on which a compression stocking was
worn had less oedema than the other leg, and reported “oedema
was most significant in the non-stockinged leg”. Before flying, the
oedema ratings were none: 56, slight: 5 and definite: 0 for the
leg on which a stocking would be worn compared to 57, 4 and
0 respectively for the other leg. After the flight, the scores for the
leg on which a stocking had been worn had worsened slightly to
none: 48, slight: 10, definite: 3; but the scores for the other leg
were much worse at none: 30, slight: 22 and definite: 9.
It was not possible to pool the data from Hagan 2008 and Loew
1998 with data from the LONGFLIT 4 trials due to different
methods used to measure oedema.
Adverse effects arising from the use of compression
stockings
Some of the reportsof the LONFLITtrialscommentedonpossible
adverse effects resulting from wearing compression stockings. In
these reports, the tolerability of the stockings was described as very
good with no complaints of side effects (LONFLIT 4 - Scholl 1;
LONFLIT 4 - Scholl 2; LONFLIT 4 - Traveno 1; LONFLIT 5).
None of the other trials reported adverse effects of wearing the
stockings, apart from the effect on superficial vein thrombosis in
the Scurr 2001 trial, as noted above.
D I S C U S S I O N
Summary of main results
This review provides relatively precise estimates for a very large
reduction in symptomless DVT among airline passengers who
were allocated to wear compression stockings compared to those
allocated not to wear such stockings.
The choice of statistical analysis - in the circumstances we encoun-
tered of having rare events that are very unevenly distributed be-
tween the treatment groups - is potentially controversial. However,
as shown in the results section, whichever method is used there is
a highly statistically significant, large effect of wearing stockings
compared to not wearing them, equivalent to the odds of a symp-
tomless DVT being decreased by approximately 90%. This might
relate to, for example, a reduction in the risk of a symptomless
deep vein thrombosis from about 10 to 30 per 1000 to 1 to 3 per
1000 long-haul passengers. There is also a large and significant
reduction in leg oedema associated with the wearing of stockings
although the quality of the evidence for this was deemed to be low.
There is moderate-quality evidence that superficial vein thrombo-
sis may be reduced if passengers wear compression stockings. The
studies reported no cases of symptomatic DVT, PE or deaths.
There is no robust evidence to indicate that the different types of
stockings assessed in the trials included in this review vary in their
effects, nor that particular subgroups of people similar to those in
these trials would not experience this benefit from wearing these
stockings. A reliable investigation of these issues would require
larger randomised trials, direct randomisation of different types
of stockings and trials in which a wider range of participants are
recruited. There also does not appear to be any significant increase
in adverse effects associated with wearing the stockings in the types
of people assessed.
Overall completeness and applicability of
evidence
The relevance of the substantial reduction in symptomless DVT
for outcomes such as death, pulmonary embolism and symp-
tomatic deep vein thrombosis cannot be assessed from this review
because there were no such events in any of the included trials.
This may be because the trials involved special additional tests on
all participants which, by identifying symptomless DVT, may have
led to effective management and thereby prevented more serious
consequences. It is also possible that death, pulmonary embolism
and symptomatic DVT would have been so rare among the people
in these trials that, even without the special diagnostic tests and
subsequent treatments, no such events would have been recorded.
Randomised trials to assess these outcomes would likely need to
include a very large number of people. Therefore, this review pro-
vides a clear guide to the large effects of compression stockings on
reducing symptomless DVT and oedema, but is unable to assess
the impact this has on outcomes that might be judged of more
relevance to airline passengers and the people who care for them.

 Quality of the evidence
This review provides high-quality evidence that wearing gradu-
ated compression stockings reduces the risk of developing a symp-
tomless DVT when travelling on a long-haul flight (over four
hours). There is moderate-quality evidence that wearing com-
pression stockings may reduce risk of developing superficial vein
thrombosis. The quality of evidence was downgraded because the
confidence interval crosses no difference and does not rule out a
small increase. Post-flight oedema was reduced in passengers who
wore compression stockings but we have graded the quality of
this evidence as low. This is because the measurement technique
used in the pooled data was not blinded or validated, and was car-
ried out by the same investigators. As the methods from a further
two studies used were different, we were unable to pool the data.
However these additional studies also reported reduced oedema in
passengers (or a leg) wearing compression stockings. As discussed
above, we were unable to assess the quality of the evidence for
the outcomes of PE, death and symptomatic DVT as no events
occurred.
Potential biases in the review process
The search used was comprehensive and we have included all rel-
evant studies. However, the possibility remains that some relevant
trials may have been missed. Two review authors independently
performed study selection and data extraction in order to min-
imise bias in the review process. The inclusion and exclusion cri-
teria set out in the protocol were strictly adhered to in order to
limit subjectivity (Clarke 2003). We followed Cochrane processes
as described by Higgins 2011 for assessing the risk of bias. Our
analyses are based mainly on assessments of symptomless DVT
which were identified through special tests and, if found, led to
additional interventions for the participants. The reliability of the
diagnosis of symptomless DVT is dependent on the quality of the
test used. This can lead to different rates of false positives and false
negatives for different tests. However, because we used randomised
trials in which the assessment of participants in both groups of
each trial involved the same diagnostic technique, the possibility
of mis-diagnosis will have been the same for both groups and will
not have introduced bias within the trials.
Agreements and disagreements with other
studies or reviews
We are aware of other systematic reviews on this topic. Hsieh 2005
appears to have used similar methods to us and did not find any
eligible studies that we had not already identified. Philbrick 2007
included case-control studies, cohort studies and randomised con-
trolled trials which reported on travel as a risk factor for VTE; or
tested preventive measures (including pharmacological agents) for
travel-related VTE. They concluded that compression stockings
“prevented travel-related VTE (P<0.05 in 4 of 6 studies)”. One
cross-over trial compared intermittent pneumatic compression de-
vices, compression stockings and periodic exercise in participants
who were immobilized for eight hours (to mimic long-haul travel,
Coppens 2007). Similar to our findings, this study reported that
compression stockings decreased the amount of oedema experi-
enced by wearers and suggested that this may play a role in pre-
venting VTE.

Implications for practice
High-quality evidence shows that airline passengers similar to
those in the trials in this review can expect a substantial reduc-
tion in their risk of a symptomless DVT if they wear compression
stockings. Wearing stockings might reduce the incidence of this
outcome from a few tens per thousand passengers, to two or three
per thousand. There is moderate-quality evidence that superficial
vein thrombosis may be reduced if passengers wear compression
stockings. Low-quality evidence shows that passengers who wear
stockings will also experience less oedema in their legs. However,
this review is unable to identify whether these effects of wearing
stockings translate into effects on outcomes such as death, pul-
monary embolism and symptomatic DVT.
Implications for research
This review shows that the question of the effects on symptomless
DVT of wearing versus not wearing compression stockings in the
types of people studied in these trials should now be regarded as
answered. Further research may be justified to investigate the rela-
tive effects of different strengths of stockings or of stockings com-
pared to other preventative strategies. Further randomised trials
to address the remaining uncertainty about the effects of wearing
versus not wearing compression stockings on outcomes such as
death, pulmonary embolism and symptomatic DVT would need
to be large. As suggested by Adi 2004, a study to assess whether air-
line travel itself is associated with an increased risk of symptomatic
DVT might require several tens of thousands of participants and
so a randomised trial to investigate a preventative strategy would
probably require a sample size at least this large.

Additional interventions: participants were also randomised to receive either dried vine
leaves (Antistax) for 7 days before the flight and on the day (13 people), diuretics on the
day of the flight (9), or no drugs (13). Participants in the diuretics group were told not
to take these drugs on the return flight

Funder: multiple sources.
Blinding: outcome assessor not blinded.
Lost to follow-up: 52; dropouts due to low compliance or flight connection problems
Participants
Inclusion criteria: high-risk participants defined as those with previous episodes of DVT,
coagulation disorders, severe obesity, limited mobility due to bone or joint problems,
neoplastic disease within the previous 2 years, or large varicose veins. Participants were
recruited through flight shops.
Exclusion criteria: not clear.
No. randomised: 885.
No. analysed: 833.
Age (years): mean 44.8 (SD 9) range 20 to 80.
Sex: 57% M, 43% F.
Interventions
Stocking Group
Type of stocking: below-knee compression stocking with 25 mmHg of pressure at the
ankle. Stockings were put on 6 to 10 hours before the flight.
No. randomised: unclear.
No. analysed: 411.
Length of flight: average 12.4 hours, range 10 to 15.
Type of seat: Economy, seat pitch 31 inches.
Route and time of flight: not available.
Additional interventions: participants were advised to move often, drink water (at least
1 glass every 2 hours), stretch limbs every hour for 2 minutes, not keep baggage in the
space under the seats, avoid salty snacks, wear comfortable clothing
Control Group
Type of control: no intervention.

Route and time of flight: not available.
Additional interventions: the same advice as the stocking group was given
Outcomes
Outcomes assessed: incidence of DVT.
DVT diagnosis method: participants were scanned within 48 hours pre flight and 24
hours post flight using Sonosite scanners with 10 MHz probes (Sonosite, Bothell, WA,
USA). B-mode and power ultrasound were used to evaluate DVT. This was done by
scanning the femoral and popliteal veins.
Site of DVT: proximal vein, distal venous system, superficial system.
Site of SVT: none developed.
Other investigations performed: none.
Additional complications reported: none.

Methods
Trial design: randomised controlled trial (parallel).
Country principal investigators: UK.
Where trial conducted: UK.
Date of trial: not reported.
Multi-centre: no.
Funder: Stamford Hospital, London, UK; and Medi UK Ltd.
Blinding: outcome assessor was blinded.
Lost to follow-up: 15/116 (stocking), 16/115 (control); dropouts due to low compliance
or flight connection problems
Participants
Inclusion criteria: participants older than 50 years and travelling 2 sectors of at least
8 hours within 6 weeks. Participants were recruited by placing advertisements in local
newspapers, travel shops and press releases. Preliminary screening included examination
and medical questionnaire, those eligible were investigated for previous DVT by duplex
ultrasound.
Exclusion criteria: participants with previous episodes of venous thrombosis, those tak-
ing anticoagulants, those regularly wearing compression stockings, those with cardiores-
piratory problems, or other serious illness.
No. randomised: 231.
No. analysed: 200.
Age (years): median 61 (IQR 56 to 66) (stocking), 62 (IQR 56 to 68) (control).
Sex: 34 M, 81 F (stocking), 55 M, 61 F (control) - based on number randomised
Interventions
Stocking Group
Type of stocking: below-knee Class 1 German Hohenstein compression stocking with
20 to 30 mmHg of pressure at the ankle. Stockings were put on before the flight and
removed on arrival.
No. randomised: 116.
No. analysed: 100.
Length of flight: more than 8 hours.
Type of seat: Economy.

Route and time of flight: not reported.
Additional interventions: none given but some participants were taking additional med-
ication: aspirin (11); HRT (16); thyroxine (6); antihypertensives (12); antipeptic ulcer
drugs (3)
Control Group
Type of control: no intervention.
No. randomised: 115.
No. analysed: 100.
Length or flight: more than 8 hours.
Type of seat: Economy.
Route and time of flight: not reported.
Additional interventions: none given but some participants were taking additional medi-
cation: aspirin (9); HRT (8); thyroxine (6); antihypertensives (10); antipeptic ulcer drugs
(8)
Outcomes
Outcomes assessed: incidence of DVT and SVT.
DVT diagnosed by: duplex ultrasound scanning which was performed during the pre
screening process and within 48 hours after the flight.
Site of DVT: not reported.
Site of SVT: knee region which was compressed by the upper edge of the stocking, in 4
participants who all had varicose veins. No SVT in the control group.
Other investigations performed: blood samples were taken before and after the flight.
Additional complications reported: none.
Notes
More females in stockings group (70% GCT versus 53% no GCT).

Comment on LONFLIT Studies, 10 August 2009
Summary
These reviews include a number of papers by Gianni Belcaro who was erased from the UK medical register in June 2007. This was for
“misconduct”, which seems to have been that he included as co-authors on his papers people who were not involved in the research.
The GMC report does not suggest that data was falsified (//webcache.gmc-uk.org/minutesfiles/3313.HTML).
Should you mention in the systematic reviews that the data may be suspect in Belcaro’s papers?
Reply
The authors of this review have been informed of concerns that have been raised about the authorship of some research papers by the
lead investigator for the LONFLIT trials (which provide most of the randomised evidence included in this review): Gianni Belcaro.
They are considering the potential impact on the findings of the review. The contact author for this Cochrane review, Mike Clarke,
has written to the Editor in Chief of Angiology, which published the reports for many of the LONFLIT studies, asking if they should
have any concerns about the reliability of these articles.
2016 update
The Editor in Chief of Angiology raised no concerns about the reliability of these articles when contacted by Mike Clarke in response
to the concerns raised about the authorship of some research papers by the lead investigator for the LONFLIT trials.

In previous versions of this review the method of concealment of allocation used in each identified study was assessed and categorized as
A (adequate), B (unclear) or C (not concealed). For this update all included studies were assessed for risk of bias using Cochrane’s ’Risk
of bias’ tool as described in Higgins 2011. In keeping with current Cochrane guidelines a ’Summary of findings’ table was included in
this update.
