T
he practice of medicine has undergone a radical 
transformation whereby the doctor-patient relation-
ship has been displaced by remuneration, patient 
satisfaction, and outcome-based metrics. Coincident with 
this paradigm shift is a dramatic rise in bureaucratic over-
sight, accountability, clinician workload, and reported rates 
of physician dissatisfaction. There is ever-growing concern 
for physician well-being in light of mounting evidence that 
more than half of American physicians, regardless of their 
career stage, exhibit signs of burnout.20,56,58 Burnout dimin-

OBJECTIVE Excessive dissatisfaction and stress among physicians can precipitate burnout, which results in dimin-
ished productivity, quality of care, and patient satisfaction and treatment adherence. Given the multiplicity of its harms 
and detriments to workforce retention and in light of the growing physician shortage, burnout has garnered much atten-
tion in recent years. Using a national survey, the authors formally evaluated burnout among neurosurgery trainees.
METHODS An 86-item questionnaire was disseminated to residents in the American Association of Neurological Sur-
geons database between June and November 2015. Questions evaluated personal and workplace stressors, mentor-
ship, career satisfaction, and burnout. Burnout was assessed using the previously validated Maslach Burnout Inventory. 
Factors associated with burnout were determined using univariate and multivariate logistic regression.
RESULTS The response rate with completed surveys was 21% (346/1643). The majority of residents were male (78%), 
26–35 years old (92%), in a stable relationship (70%), and without children (73%). Respondents were equally distributed 
across all residency years. Eighty-one percent of residents were satisfied with their career choice, although 41% had at 
some point given serious thought to quitting. The overall burnout rate was 67%. In the multivariate analysis, notable fac-
tors associated with burnout included inadequate operating room exposure (OR 7.57, p = 0.011), hostile faculty (OR 4.07, 
p = 0.008), and social stressors outside of work (OR 4.52, p = 0.008). Meaningful mentorship was protective against 
burnout in the multivariate regression models (OR 0.338, p = 0.031).
CONCLUSIONS Rates of burnout and career satisfaction are paradoxically high among neurosurgery trainees. While 
several factors were predictive of burnout, including inadequate operative exposure and social stressors, meaningful 
mentorship proved to be protective against burnout. The documented negative effects of burnout on patient care and 
health care economics necessitate further studies for potential solutions to curb its rise.

ishes access to medical care as affected physicians show 
more absenteeism, are more likely to curtail hours, or, 
worse yet, shutter their practices altogether for retirement 
at a time when the US physician shortage is already in 
dire straits.21,68 Furthermore, burnout and other measures 
of overall psychological health are directly linked not only 
to productivity, but also to quality of care and patient satis-
faction and adherence to treatment regimens.15,17,28,39,59, 
60,69
Burnout is the by-product of unchecked professional 
and emotional distress in the context of workplace dis-
satisfaction.37 In 1974 psychologist Herbert Freudenberger 
first described “staff burnout” as a state of vital exhaustion 
in the workplace that culminates in readily recognizable 
behavioral traits.30 Christina Maslach later defined burn-
out as a syndrome characterized by the triad of emotional 
exhaustion, depersonalization, and a low sense of personal 
accomplishment.40 It generally develops in individuals 
whose occupation brings them into perpetual human con-
tact, with emotional exhaustion appearing first. Here, the 
subject lacks the mental fortitude to impart emotional sup-
port to others. Gradually, there is psychological isolation 
until cynicism and detachment in interpersonal relations 
emerge as a coping strategy. In its earliest stages, burn-
out can coexist with many necessary clinical merits, such 
as empathy and compassion. However, if left unattended, 
burnout erodes the foundation of these attributes and 
eventually supersedes them. Burnout can be accompanied 
by physical or psychological manifestations (for example, 
insomnia, appetite changes, headaches, and irritability, 
among others) in much the same way as depression.34 
However, unlike the latter’s global impact on a person, 
burnout disrupts how an individual interfaces with their 
work environment. Thus, the two are distinct clinical enti-
ties, even though burnout can degenerate into depression.25
Nevertheless, burnout is not a normal eventuality in the 
course of daily occupational stress and personal sacrifice. 
Rather, it is an adverse consequence of discordance that 
ensues when a clinician’s emotional distress is not suffi-
ciently mitigated by the intrinsic reward system of prac-
ticing medicine or hobbies and physical exercise.23 Ulti-
mately, there is a loss of meaning and purpose in the role 
as health care provider. Factors that have often been impli-
cated in burnout include excessive work hours or call re-
quirements, loss of autonomy, and large amounts of work-
home interference.9,18 Nowhere is the stage more aptly set 
for burnout than in residency training, where these fac-
tors all hold true. Although there is considerable variation 
across specialties, residency burnout rates are reportedly 
twice as high for physicians in training than for their post-
graduate counterparts.22,57 In one series, 76% of surveyed 
residents exhibited signs of burnout.34,57 Even more alarm-
ing, studies have suggested that burnout appears as early 
as in medical school.13,19 These findings underscore the 
pervasiveness of burnout among health care professionals 
and would seem to suggest an epidemic is underway.
Few studies have addressed burnout in a field as tech-
nically and mentally onerous as neurosurgery. In a recent 
national survey of practicing neurosurgeons, 57% of re-
spondents had documented signs of burnout, although 
70% would choose the same career if given the choice, 
attesting to the immensely rewarding nature of the spe-
cialty.41 Deeply concerning, however, is the fact that only 
36% would ever recommend neurosurgery as a career to 
their offspring. This datum echoes a widespread sentiment 
across the profession of medicine, in which the majority 
would not recommend their career choice to others.42 Such 
deterrence poses a considerable challenge to workforce re-
cruitment and, ultimately, the viability and sustainability 
of health care. Studies on career satisfaction and burnout 
are therefore instrumental in identifying factors that pre-
cipitate psychological distress so that reforms can be insti-
tuted to stem the tide of disgruntled American physicians.
Here we present the results of a nationwide survey 
analyzing the extent of resident burnout, career satisfac-
tion, and other quality of life variables related to physician 
well-being.
Methods
A modified version of the attending neurosurgeon burn-
out survey used by McAbee et al.41 was provided electron-
ically via the SurveyMonkey platform. While questions 
paralleled the format of the prior attending-based survey, 
the questions significantly differed to target the resident 
population (Appendix Table). We conducted the survey 
through a SurveyMonkey questionnaire linked to the 
American Association of Neurological Surgeons (AANS) 
listserv to ensure that each resident received a unique and 
confidential online survey link. Each individual link was 
de-identified with a unique 10-digit identification assigned 
with no capability of tracing results to a respondent. Im-
portantly, once a survey was submitted from an individual 
link, the questionnaire link became inactive, ensuring that 
no individual response duplications occurred.
The survey consisted of 86 questions, including 4 free-
text questions and 22 questions from the previously vali-
dated Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI).40 An electronic 
invitation was sent to all neurosurgical resident trainee 
members of the AANS on behalf of the Council of State 
Neurosurgical Societies (CSNS). The survey invitation 
was sent on 3 separate occasions between June and No-
vember 2015. Electronic communication with survey re-
spondents consisted of a cover letter specifying study ob-
jectives and an individualized and de-identified link to the 
questionnaire. The introductory email invitation specified 
that each response would be coded in a de-identified fash-
ion with no individual identifiers and strict confidentiality 
enforced. Critical email wording was as follows:
Dear Resident:
The Council of State Neurosurgical Societies (CSNS), the 
socioeconomic arm of the American Association of Neu-
rological Surgeons (AANS) and Congress of Neurological 
Surgeons (CNS), is conducting a nationwide survey of current 
neurosurgical residents identifying predictors of job satisfac-
tion, stress and burnout.
This online survey should take less than five minutes to com-
plete. This survey is strictly confidential with every response 
made anonymous.
Neurosurgery is arguably one of the more mentally and 
physically demanding fields in medicine. A similar study 
conducted among practicing neurosurgeons was recently pub-

lished in the Journal of Neurosurgery. Though there are many 
studies on burnout and job satisfaction in almost all fields of 
medicine, few studies target residents. We hope to identify 
predictors of satisfaction/dissatisfaction not only among resi-
dent neurosurgeons as a whole, but within various subgroups, 
such as neurosurgeons of different age groups, geographic 
locations and training levels. Identities will remain anony-
mous and may be pooled in a de-identified cohort for survey 
again in two to three years to monitor changes in opinions 
over time.
Participation was encouraged by program coordinators 
but not mandatory. This national survey was promoted 
and funded by the CSNS.
Questionnaire Composition
The survey included questions on key demographics, 
including age, sex, relationship status, number of children, 
and postgraduate year of training. General questions were 
aimed to determine whether respondents would choose 
their specialty or residency program if presented with 
the choice again, goals after residency, and prior consid-
erations of quitting training or leaving medicine entirely. 
Historical questions ascertained whether respondents had 
completed a subinternship in their program, felt they had 
an adequate perception of the field prior to applying, or had 
spent time away from education on research or other ven-
tures before embarking on training. Program-related ques-
tions included the position of their program on the original 
rank list, size of resident complement, social atmosphere, 
leadership changes, and proximity of their training pro-
gram to immediate family. Additional questions focused 
on mentorship and whether there was any perceived bene-
fit to such a relationship, from the standpoint of both being 
a mentee and serving as a mentor to others. Specifically, 
mentorship was defined as “meaningful” if the trainee felt 
that they were benefiting from their relationship with their 
mentor. Finally, optional open-ended questions allowed 
trainees to report whether specific aspects of their train-
ing were associated with a worsened or improved training 
experience (Appendix Table).
Personal and professional stressors were gauged and 
graded along a 6-point Likert scale in terms of how resi-
dents felt they had been affected over the previous 12–24 
months. Response categories were as follows: not at all 
or small, moderate, large, or extreme amounts. However, 
these categories were collapsed into a dichotomous scale 
for the purposes of statistical analysis, with large to ex-
treme responses interpreted as having the variable of in-
terest. Satisfaction in the workplace and home environ-
ments was also graded along a multipoint Likert scale 
from very satisfied to very dissatisfied and was similarly 
dichotomized for statistical interpretation. The method of 
converting the Likert score to a dichotomous variable, in-
cluding the method of dividing groups, was based on the 
same methodology of conversion and group division em-
ployed by McAbee et al. in their analysis of burnout and 
career satisfaction in attending neurosurgeons.41 This was 
intended to provide a basis for direct comparison between 
resident and attending results. Career satisfaction was de-
termined as the responses of “very satisfied” or “some-
what satisfied” in relation to questions addressing this pa-
rameter. Variables collected in the survey included overall 
career satisfaction, intrinsic rewards of the profession (that 
is, appreciation from patients and staff), academic produc-
tivity, interpersonal relationships, and opportunities for 
work-life balance.
Burnout was determined according to the MBI, which 
uses a 7-point Likert scale from 0 through 6 to address 22 
questions: 0 = never, 1 = a few times per year, 2 = once a 
month, 3 = a few times per month, 4 = once a week, 5 = 
a few times per week, and 6 = every day. Three subscales 
were used to evaluate a corresponding number of dimen-
sions for burnout: emotional exhaustion (9 questions), de-
personalization (5 questions), and low sense of personal 
accomplishment (8 questions). Responses were stratified 
into low, medium, and high categories. Consistent with 
previously published studies on health care workers,49 
burnout was defined by high scores for emotional exhaus-
tion (≥ 27) and/or depersonalization (≥ 10).
Statistical Analysis
Demographic information was compiled from a series 
of descriptive statistics. As previously mentioned, select 
survey responses using multipoint Likert scales were con-
verted into dichotomous variables for statistical analysis. 
For example, when addressing career satisfaction, respon-
dents could choose one of the following responses: “very 
satisfied,” “somewhat satisfied,” “neutral,” “somewhat dis-
satisfied,” “very dissatisfied,” or “not applicable.” Howev-
er, in the final analyses, responses were classified as either 
satisfied or not satisfied. As our primary objectives were 
directed at burnout and career satisfaction, we performed 
univariate analysis to look for associations between key 
demographic data and clinical measures of both of these 
outcomes by using logistic regression. Any item found to 
have a p < 0.05 on univariate testing was then placed in a 
multivariate analysis using a forward stepwise manner. To 
avoid collinearity among multiple “subjective” response 
collinear variables, we limited multivariate analysis to 
objective variables showing significance with univariate 
analysis and no more than 3 subjective variables. Two-
tailed analysis with p < 0.05 was used as the cutoff for sta-
tistical significance. Results were reported with adjusted 
odds ratios and corresponding 95% confidence intervals. 
All data were analyzed using the SAS 9.4 statistical soft-
ware (SAS Institute Inc.).
Results
Survey Results
Of the 1643 email addresses to which the survey in-
vitation was sent, 395 responses (24%) were received. Of 
these, 346 (21%) were included in the final analysis since 
49 were excluded on the basis of an incomplete survey. 
Most residents were male (78%), over 31 years old (52%), in 
a long-term relationship (70%), and had no children (73%). 
Respondents were equally distributed across all residency 
years. These demographic data are summarized in Table 1.
Forty-three percent of respondents made the decision 
to pursue neurosurgery during years 3 and 4 of medi-
cal school, and nearly one-fifth made their choice prior

to medical school. Eighty-one percent of residents were 
satisfied with their career, of which 42% reported being 
very satisfied with their choice. Although 75% felt their 
professional and personal lives would improve following 
residency, 41% had given serious thought to quitting neu-
rosurgery. If presented with the choice again, 79% said 
they would choose neurosurgery as a specialty, and 64% 
would recommend neurosurgery to a prospective medical 
school applicant. These and other perceptions are listed 
in Table 2.
A satisfactory work-life balance and sufficient time 
for personal development and didactics were reported by 
32%, 35%, and 30%, respectively (Fig. 1). When asked to 
address factors that had appreciably affected their psyche 
in the previous 24 months, notable stressors with at least a 
moderate impact included poor control over one’s sched-
ule (61%), inadequate wages or burdensome debt (49%), 
hostile faculty (36%), hostile co-residents (31%), and co-
resident attrition (31%; Fig. 2). The majority of residents 
(72%) were concerned about the direction of health care 
reform and how it might impact their future, with 42% 
describing feeling at least moderately burdened by future 
job prospects. When considering their quality of life as 
a resident, 59% were hopeful that things would improve. 
Conversely, when asked if life in residency would worsen, 
45% believed that was the case (Fig. 3).
Despite having one of the most competitive careers, 
43% of residents reported a low sense of personal accom-
plishment (Fig. 4). High emotional exhaustion and high 
depersonalization rates were calculated to be 36% and 
60%, respectively. The overall burnout rate among neu-
rosurgery trainees was 67%. Trends of the various MBI 
indices by postgraduate year are listed in Table 3 and de-
picted in Fig. 5.
Predictors of Burnout and Career Satisfaction
Several notable demographic factors with variable 
levels of burnout correlation in the literature, including 
age, sex, postgraduate year, relationship status, and hav-
ing children,34,35,43,55 were not correlated with burnout in 
our study. Variables with strong associations included 
occupational stressors, such as inadequate exposure to 
the operating room (OR 10.96, p < 0.01), hostile faculty 
(OR 9.02, p < 0.0001), hostile co-residents (OR 5.05, p < 
0.001), feeling underappreciated by patients or staff (OR 
5.59–7.73, p < 0.0001), poor control over one’s schedule 
(OR 6.72, p < 0.0001), and co-resident attrition (OR 3.33, 
p < 0.01). Results of the univariate analysis are presented 
in Table 4.

In the multivariate analysis, notable factors associated 
with burnout included inadequate operating room expo-
sure (OR 7.57, p = 0.011), hostile faculty (OR 4.07, p = 
0.008), and social stressors outside of work (OR 4.52, p = 
0.008). Moreover, residents who felt they were not benefit-
ing from their interaction with their mentors were 3 times 
more likely to exhibit burnout in the multivariate models 
(OR 2.96, p = 0.031; Table 5).

fects on a resident’s emotional well-being with resultant 
detriment to patient care and health care economics. The 
extensive reach of burnout has prompted action because of 
its presumed role in medical errors and associations with 
higher rates of depression, substance abuse, relationship 
discord, and suicide.8,11,27,28,57,66 Whereas the prevalence of 
burnout in US workers is estimated to be 28%, the num-
ber is closer to 40% for physicians and 57% for practicing 
neurosurgeons.41,56 Burnout is also noted to be higher in 
trainees than in independent practitioners of the same spe-
cialty.3 No previous studies have determined rates of burn-
out among neurosurgery residents. We have determined 
the overall rate of burnout to be 67% based on the results 
of a nationwide survey, one of the highest rates among 
residents (Table 6).
With advances in electronic communication, the line 
between work and home life has become increasingly 
blurred. Poor dissociation between work and personal life 
has long been recognized as a source of employee distress 
and burnout. Many organizations have thus devised poli-
cies limiting employee access to work matters when they 
walk out the door: Volkswagen turns off access to email, 
and Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse have a “Saturday 
rule” stipulating that analysts must be away from the of-
fice for a designated period.29 Medicine followed suit in 
2003, curtailing the resident workweek to 80 hours. De-

spite this change, 65% of neurosurgery residents reported 
insufficient time for personal growth and development and 
68% had not achieved a satisfactory work-life balance. 
These individuals were, in turn, 4 times more likely to suf-
fer burnout (OR 4.37, p < 0.0001), according to univariate 
analysis. This is not surprising, as time outside the hospital 
is often filled with scholarly pursuits, including indepen-
dent study, operative planning, and research. Therefore, 
successfully combating burnout and improving resident 
quality of life extends beyond work hours. A recent pi-
lot study addressed neurosurgery departmental wellness 
through a physical education and nutrition program, prom-
ising steps in managing stress.61
Central to physician wellness is the intrinsic reward and 
career satisfaction offered by the specialty. While neuro-
surgery is renowned for arduous training, its tremendous 
impact makes for thankful patients and a rewarding pro-
fession. This may, in part, explain why traditionally chal-
lenging fields with high susceptibility to burnout can also 
have high satisfaction rates. However, a decrease in intrin-

sic reward is often followed by a corresponding decrease 
in satisfaction. Residents who felt underappreciated by pa-
tients or staff had a nearly 7-fold reduction in career satis-
faction (OR 0.15 and 0.19, respectively, p < 0.0001) and an 
8-fold increase in burnout (OR 5.59 and 7.73, respectively, 
p < 0.0001). Despite the high burnout rates, 81% described 
being satisfied with their career, and 79% would pursue 
neurosurgery as a specialty again if given the choice. This 
paradoxical relationship between burnout and career satis-
faction has been noted in the literature and is often attrib-
uted to the subjectivity inherent to burnout surveys and the 
episodic nature of burnout over the course of training.5,38,41
A review of the outcome trends revealed that a high de-
gree of career satisfaction was maintained throughout all 
7 years of training (Fig. 5). However, burnout rates spiked 
in postgraduate years 2 and 3 (76%), trending downward 
thereafter. These findings are possibly attributable to the 
change in clinical responsibility and shared decision mak-
ing, which is greatest across these years when one stands 
on the front lines as the “consultant” resident. While one 
cannot generalize the natural course of burnout between 
specialties, it is curious that an analogous upswing in 
burnout occurs in internal medicine and pediatrics, with 
the trend reversing 2 years into training.7,46,65 This reversal 
may result from the proverbial “light at the end of the tun-
nel” as residency nears completion. Nonetheless, these pat-
terns may offer insight into the timing of any intervention 
targeting burnout, as well as those persons most likely to 
benefit from therapy.
In recent years, pursuing a career in medicine has be-
come synonymous with being saddled with high financial 
debt. The median indebtedness of medical school gradu-
ates in 1992 stood at just around $50,000.53 By 2016, this 
figure approached $190,000.4 And yet, resident wages have 
remained relatively stagnant over this period. While the 
decision to pursue a specific specialty is likely multifacto-
rial, a growing body of evidence implicates debt and life-
style as major determinants of career choice.16 Some stud-
ies indicate, intuitively so, that graduates with higher debt 
are more likely to pursue higher-paid specialties.32,63 In a 
longitudinal study of students from 2 prominent medical 
schools over an 8-year period, Grayson et al. discovered 
that higher debt loads were predictive of a student’s likeli-
hood to switch career trajectories from primary care to 
a higher-paying alternative.32 Because debt influences the 
timing of major life events, such as the decision to start a 
family or buy a home,53 it may ultimately serve as a source 
of stress and burnout in those who may be forced to post-
pone or forego these milestones. Indeed, neurosurgery res-
idents from our survey with burdensome debt were twice

as likely to exhibit burnout (OR 1.78, p = 0.03) with a cor-
responding reduction in career satisfaction (OR 0.45, p < 
0.01), according to univariate analysis.
Medical school graduates have regarded mentorship as 
the single most influential factor on specialty choice.44 It 
has also been viewed as an important catalyst for success 
in residency training and beyond. For instance, increased 
academic productivity based on higher numbers of publi-
cations and grants,51,52,62 a greater likelihood for promo-
tion,70 and higher rates of career satisfaction45,54 have all 
been directly linked to mentorship. Despite these benefits, 
less than 50% of medical students, residents, and junior 
faculty report having mentors.1,33,50 The problem seems 
less to do with the desire for mentorship and more to do 
with excessive clinical, administrative, and scholarly de-
mands on faculty that preclude time for meaningful men-
tor-mentee relationships.14,47 Sixty-eight percent of respon-
dents in our survey claimed to have a mentor of some sort, 
which is higher than rates in the literature. Among those 
with a mentor, approximately 20% described feeling that 
they were not significantly benefiting from the interac-
tion, and they, in turn, exhibited 3-fold more burnout (OR 
2.96, p = 0.03), according to multivariable analysis. Re-
spondents were further offered the opportunity to expand 
on their mentor relationships, with common responses 
that they valued “career guidance,” “encouragement from 
staff,” and “faculty research guidance/productivity.” This 
suggests that, ultimately, it is the quality rather than the 
nominal nature of the mentoring relationship that matters. 
For mentoring to be effective, mentors may need to un-
dergo development training. In one survey, even those with 
significant mentorship experience expressed a desire for 
training workshops that addressed complex issues such as 
race and culture in the workplace.64 Increased availabil-
ity of career development sessions in which prospective 
mentors could be formally trained in the art of mentorship 
may be a potentially useful adjunct for faculty at training 
hospitals. Such an addition would also likely be self-per-
petuating since those with effective mentors are generally 
more likely to offer mentorship to others.62
Graded responsibility and supervision through a hier-
archical structure is a cornerstone of surgical education.47 
Much has changed since the inception of this Halstedian 
tradition in 1889—notably, a cap on excessive hours and an 
erosion of the supervised independence residents once en-
joyed. However, many traditions persist within the hierar-
chy, including a carryover of the mentality to “do unto oth-
ers as you would have others do unto you.” Almost a third 
of residents surveyed in our study noted that their lives 
entailed dealing with hostile faculty or residents within 
the past 2 years. The presence of difficult interactions with 
faculty increased burnout more than 4-fold (OR 4.07, p = 
0.008), according to multivariate analysis. While the true 
nature of these interactions cannot be further investigated, 
relationships between trainees and their senior residents 
and faculty can often be strained. Hostile encounters and 
other negative experiences are known deterrents to pursu-
ing surgery.33 In light of the precipitous decline in medi-

cal students’ interest in surgery compared with that in the 
1980s,48 hostile practices must be further addressed by 
programs to successfully combat burnout and preserve 
surgical pedigree.
Meaningful mentorship and personal stressors were 
significant predictors of burnout and career satisfaction in 
a multivariable regression model. However, high degrees 
of correlation between individual subjective predictor vari-
ables, such as positive responses to multiple stressors oc-
curring together, limited the ability to include all answers 
to purely subjective questions in the multivariate analysis. 
The use of subjective rating scales in our questionnaire and 
data analysis limits objective interpretation of the impact 
of individual subjective factors, though we did attempt to 
mitigate this through limited incorporation of subjective 
variables in our multivariate model and by modeling our 
survey off of prior neurosurgical burnout studies in the at-
tending population. Current limitations of this work are 
those typical of surveys, such as inaccurate reporting by 
respondents due to recall bias. Our response rate was only 
21%, which is on the lower end of the spectrum compared 
with rates in other published studies on trainees. Thus, one 
possible scenario is a skewing of data trends secondary 
to disproportionate completion by a particular subgroup 
(that is, so-called response bias). This may be due to the 
fact that those who suffer burnout are either less likely to 
complete the survey because of apathy or more likely to do 
so because of interest in the subject matter. In addition, de-
spite a rigorous de-identification process for respondents, 
it is unclear whether our response rate was affected by 
potential concerns regarding confidentiality of responses. 
Despite the relatively low response rate, our data showed 
a relatively homogeneous distribution of responses, with 
approximately one-quarter of the responses corresponding 
to the East Coast, the West Coast, the South, and the Mid-
west. In addition, responses were similarly distributed at 
14%–18% per year among the postgraduate years. As the 
direction of influence cannot be ascertained, there may be 
some degree of response bias that remains unaccounted 
for. Future studies could include a repeat of the above with 
greater incentives to enhance completion rates. Addition-
ally, because each respondent was linked to a unique iden-
tifier, it would be informative to track resident responses 
over the course of their residency to more accurately delin-
eate burnout trends and identify causal factors.
Conclusions
Burnout is a pervasive problem among both physicians 
in practice and residents in training. Several factors were 
independently identified as predictors of burnout, including 
personal and occupational stressors, which impact resident 
education and probably patient-related outcomes. Analysis 
of burnout trends revealed a spike between postgraduate 
years 1 and 2, suggesting the best timing for any interven-
tion. Mentorship was identified for its putative benefit in 
combating burnout and may be one systematic approach 
that programs can formally adopt. Despite work-hour re-
strictions, both poor work-life dissociation and limited 
time for personal growth and development remain central 
issues. Nonetheless, the majority of residents were satis-
fied with their professional careers, were hopeful about the 
future of health care, and would choose neurosurgery as a 
profession again if given the choice.
