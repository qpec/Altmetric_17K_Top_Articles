Bumped kinase inhibitors (BKIs) of Cryptosporidium parvum calcium-dependent protein kinase 1 (CpCDPK1) are leading candi-
dates for treatment of cryptosporidiosis-associated diarrhea. Potential cardiotoxicity related to anti–human ether-à-go-go potassium 
channel (hERG) activity of the first-generation anti-Cryptosporidium BKIs triggered further testing for efficacy. A luminescence assay 
adapted for high-throughput screening was used to measure inhibitory activities of BKIs against C. parvum in vitro. Furthermore, 
neonatal and interferon γ knockout mouse models of C. parvum infection identified BKIs with in vivo activity. Additional iterative 
experiments for optimum dosing and selecting BKIs with minimum levels of hERG activity and frequencies of other safety liabilities 
included those that investigated mammalian cell cytotoxicity, C. parvum proliferation inhibition in vitro, anti–human Src inhibition, 
hERG activity, in vivo pharmacokinetic data, and efficacy in other mouse models. Findings of this study suggest that fecal concentra-
tions greater than parasite inhibitory concentrations correlate best with effective therapy in the mouse model of cryptosporidiosis, 
but a more refined model for efficacy is needed.

Cryptosporidiosis is a significant contributor to global diar-
rheal morbidity and mortality. Cryptosporidium is associated 
with moderate-to-severe diarrhea, stunting, and death in chil-
dren <2 years old in resource-limited environments [1–3]. In 
immunocompromised patients, cryptosporidiosis diarrhea may 
be life threatening.
Cryptosporidium organisms are obligate intracellular par-
asites that live in intracellular but extracytosolic parasitopho-
rous vacuoles located beneath the apical plasma membrane of 
infected intestinal epithelial cells [4]. Large waterborne out-
breaks are common, such as the 1993 Milwaukee, Wisconsin, 
incident in which 403 000 cases were reported after the local 
water supply became contaminated with Cryptosporidium 
oocysts [5]. The infectious dose for humans ranges from 9 to 
132 oocysts, depending on the strain of Cryptosporidium [6, 7]. 
The incapacitating nature of the diarrhea, high rate of infection, 
low infectious dose, association with death and stunting, and 
resistance of parasite to elimination from the environment are 
all factors that have heightened public health concerns about 
the disease.
The only Food and Drug Administration–approved therapy 
for cryptosporidiosis, nitazoxanide, was shown in a randomized 
trial to reduce the duration of diarrhea by approximately 2 days 
in immunocompetent individuals [8]. Nitazoxanide also has 
limited efficacy and a high failure rate in immunocompromised 
individuals [9]. It is not approved for use in children <12 months 
of age, whereas studies in malnourished children show poor 
response rate [10]. With the burden of disease falling dispro-
portionately on young children in regions with a high human 
immunodeficiency virus prevalence [11] and widespread mal-
nutrition, better drugs are needed for cryptosporidiosis therapy.
Multiple studies have shown that inhibition of apicomplexan 
calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) interfere with 
the parasites’ ability to invade or egress mammalian host cells 
[12–14]. Calcium regulation in diverse metabolic and functional 
pathways is essential to apicomplexan parasites’ survival [15–18]. 
It has previously been demonstrated that C. parvum growth was 
inhibited by BKIs that target CpCDPK1 [19]. BKI 1294 exhibited 
anti-Cryptosporidium efficacy in the SCID/beige immunocom-
promised mouse and the newborn calf C. parvum clinical mod-
els [20, 21]. Since Cryptosporidium infections are predominant 
in the gastrointestinal tract, therapeutic agents with unconven-
tional pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties may 
be required for effective treatment. Here we report our progress 
to identify BKIs that are effective against Cryptosporidium.

UGA1 transfected to express nanoluciferase (Nluc) [24], puri-
fication of oocysts from fecal specimens [23, 25], synthesis of 
BKIs [19, 26, 27], measurement of in vitro CpCDPK1 activity 
[19], pharmacokinetic analysis of plasma and fecal BKI concen-
trations [15, 21], in vitro investigation of BKI plasma protein 
binding [28], and determination of BKI efficacy in neonatal 
mice [21] and adult SCID/beige mice [20] have been previously 
described. Variances from published procedures are included in 
the Supplementary Materials and Methods.
C. parvum Growth Inhibition by BKIs
Assays to determine growth inhibition and the 50% effec-
tive concentration (EC50) were performed using a C. parvum 
strain UGA1 expressing Nluc in human ileocecal adenocar-
cinoma (HCT-8) cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) as previously 
described [24] with the following modifications. HCT-8 cells 
were inoculated onto 96-well plates and allowed to grow for 
48 hours to 90%–100% confluence. C. parvum oocysts were 
incubated for 10 minutes in 10% bleach at room temperature 
and washed with Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline. One 
thousand oocysts per well were applied to plates with Roswell 
Park Memorial Institute 1640 (RPMI) medium supplemented 
with 10% horse serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 
the same time as compound addition and incubated for 48 
hours. The monolayers were lysed for 1 hour before Nano-Glo 
luciferase reagent (Promega, Madison, WI) was added, and 
relative luminescence units (RLU) were determined on an 
EnVision Plate Reader (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA). EC50 
values were calculated using Prism (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA). 
Assays were repeated 2–3 times, and representative data are 
expressed as means ± standard deviation.
Efficacy in Adult Interferon γ (IFN-γ) Knockout (KO) Mice
Female IFN-γ KO mice (B6.129S7-Ifngtm1Ts/J, Jackson 
Laboratories) aged 8–10 weeks were infected by oral gavage with 
1000–10 000 C. parvum UGA1 oocysts carrying Nluc in 0.1 mL 
of Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline. Beginning on day 3 or 
6 after infection, mice were dosed orally with BKI suspended in 
0.2 mL of oral vehicle (3% ethanol/7% Tween 80/90% saline) or 
vehicle only once daily for 5 days. Mice were moved to clean 
cages after each dose and fecal collection. Fecal specimens were 
collected daily and weighed from each group during dosing and 
twice weekly out to 20–21 days after infection. Each fecal sam-
ple was checked for luminescence on the day of collection [24], 
and RLU readings were normalized to fecal sample weights. For 
subcutaneous doses, the vehicle was 60% Phosal 53 MCT/30% 
PEG/10% ethanol, as oral vehicle can cause inflammation when 
injected (unpublished data). GraphPad Prism was used to deter-
mine the statistical significance of outcomes, using the Student t 
test and the correlation coefficient (8) for efficacy, with respect to 
systemic exposure (as measured by the area under curve [AUC]) 
and fecal concentrations.
Animal Ethics Statement
All animal experiments were approved by the institutional ani-
mal care and use committees at the participating universities 
(University of Washington, University of Georgia, University of 
Arizona, and University of Texas Medical Branch).
RESULTS
Lead BKIs were selected as potential Cryptosporidium therapies 
on the basis of favorable in vitro parameters, including c-Src 
off-target effects, mammalian cytotoxicity, hERG activity, and 
efficacy in the HCT-8 infection model (Table 1 and Figure 1A). 
Select lead candidates were evaluated for efficacy in neonatal 
mice and in plasma and fecal specimens from adult mice after 
oral dosage. BKIs were also eliminated on the basis of effi-
cacy or exposure findings that approached or exceeded hERG 
or toxicity levels, as indicated by the in vitro results (Tables 1 
and 2 and Figure 1A). Adult mouse efficacies were evaluated 
for all remaining BKIs, with analyses of efficacious compounds 
repeated to determine their effect at different treatment times, 
concentrations, and dose administrations (Figures 1–3).
Enzymatic and Cellular Potency and Off-Target Cytotoxicity
The BKIs described here were tested for the inhibition of recombi-
nant CpCDPK1 activity (Table 1). All BKIs were counter-screened 
against the mammalian tyrosine kinase c-Src and screened for 
mammalian cytotoxicity in vitro to eliminate toxic compounds. 
BKIs with activity against c-Src were eliminated because of con-
cerns about off-target inhibition of mammalian kinases [29]. BKI 
1294 had previously been reported to inhibit hERG at concen-
trations needed for efficacy, and hERG is a cardiotoxicity lia-
bility to be avoided [27, 30]. Accordingly, the remaining BKIs 
were screened for hERG inhibition by the thallium-flux assay for 
potassium channels [31, 32]. The BKIs listed in (Table 1) have a 
≥10 fold higher hERG 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) than 
BKI 1294 and thus have less potential for cardiotoxicity.
In Vitro Inhibition of Cryptosporidium Growth by BKIs
Nluc-expressing C. parvum oocysts were used to infect HCT-8 
cells to assay for cellular BKI inhibition [24]. Compounds with 
an IC50 of >0.10 μM against recombinant CpCDPK1 enzyme 
showed little or no activity against the parasites in vitro, 
whereas compounds with a CpCDPK1 IC50 of <0.020 µM inhib-
ited Cryptosporidium proliferation in the low micromolar range 
(Table 1). BKIs RM-1-22, RM-1-89, 1243, 1266, 1416, 1610, and 
1624 were all eliminated from further examination because of 
poor activity, off-target c-Src inhibition, or mammalian cell 
cytotoxicity (Figure 1B).
BKI Efficacy Against C. parvum Infection in Neonatal Mice
Twelve BKIs, 1294, 1318, 1369, 1412, 1534, 1546, 1550, 1553, 
1556, 1557, 1649, and 1663, have good C. parvum growth inhi-
bition and little cytotoxicity or c-Src inhibition (Table 1). These

BKIs were tested in a neonatal mouse model of C. parvum 
infection at an oral dose of 25 mg/kg given twice daily. For all 
compounds, infection levels decreased by 14%–76% relative to 
levels after vehicle treatment (Table 1). The least effective BKI 
in this series, 1412, reduced oocyst shedding by a level similar 
to that for paromomycin (Table 1). BKIs 1556, 1649, and 1663 
showed signs of toxicity—specifically, protruding sternums—in 
infected neonatal mice. Although it is not intended to evaluate 
toxicity, the neonatal mouse model is practical for investigation 
and interpretation of data for various aspects of cryptosporid-
iosis in human infants, including potential harm from drug 
treatment. For this reason and its hERG-associated liability 
(Table 1), 1663 was eliminated from further consideration 
(Figure 1B). Compounds 1412, 1546, 1553, and 1557 were elim-
inated because of suboptimal efficacy in neonatal mice, defined 
as a <50% reduction of infection levels (Figure 1B).
BKI Levels in Mouse Plasma and Feces
Plasma and stool drug levels were determined after oral dosing 
in adult mice (Table 2). BKI 1556 was eliminated because its high 
oral exposure led to a concern that it would reach hERG-inhib-
iting plasma concentrations (Table 1 and Figure 1B). BKI 1649 
was further evaluated at doses of <25 mg/kg twice daily, because 
25 mg/kg twice daily was toxic in infected neonatal mice.
BKI Efficacy in the IFN-γ KO Mouse Model of C. parvum Infection
It is not yet clear which mouse model of Cryptosporidium 
infection predicts effective therapy in humans. In the IFN-γ 
KO mice model, infection is progressive, whereas immu-
nocompetent neonatal mice are transiently infected for 
10 days before the infection is cleared [24]. BKIs 1266, 1294, 
1318, 1369, 1534, 1550, and 1649 were delivered orally for 
5 days beginning at day 3 after infection (Figure 2A and 2B). 
Compound 1266 (CpCDPK1 IC50,  0.58 µM; C. parvum EC50, 
>80 µM) was included as a negative control and showed no 
clearance of C. parvum, compared with untreated controls 
(Figure 2A). In contrast, BKIs 1294, 1369, and 1534 sig-
nificantly reduced parasite shedding (P < .002; Figure 2A 
and 2B). BKIs 1550 and 1318 (P < .5 for both) only slightly 
reduced the parasite load and were eliminated from further 
consideration (Figure 2B). BKI 1649 was delivered at a dose 
of 6 mg/kg/day, owing to its high oral exposure (Table 2) and 
neonatal mouse toxicity at 25 mg/kg twice daily, and still sig-
nificantly reduced infection (P < .01) and was therefore wor-
thy of further evaluation.
No clinical signs of illness were observed in the infected 
IFN-γ KO mice, except for gradual weight loss and decreased 
activity in control and unsuccessfully treated mice. Infection 
intensities varied between the different IFN-γ KO mouse 
experiments. This can be observed by higher fecal luciferase 
levels in the second experiment (Figure 2B). The control mice 
referenced in (Figure 2B) lost ≥20% of their baseline body 
weight—the threshold at which euthanasia is required—by 
20 days after infection, unlike the control mice referenced in 
(Figure 2A), where this threshold was not reached by the end 
of the experiment. The increased infection level was associated 
with relapsed oocyst shedding after the completion of dosing in 
some experiments. BKI 1294 administration consistently led to 
a significant reduction of infection, but a recurrent increase in 
parasite excretion was observed (Figure 2B). This was different 
than the initial experiment, in which no recurrent increase was 
noted with the same dose (Figure 2A). The greater relapse in the

γ knockout mice, based on nanoluciferase activity log RLU plotted on y-axis (A–C), and efficacy of BKI 1534 in SCID/beige mice, using reverse transcription–polymerase chain 
reaction to quantify infection (8). A, BKIs were delivered orally for 5 days, beginning 3 days after infection. In vivo inhibition by BKIs 1266, 1294, 1534, and 1550. BKI 1266, 
with limited inhibition of the C. parvum calcium-dependent protein kinase 1 target enzyme, was included as a negative control. BKIs 1294 and 1534 significantly reduced 
parasite shedding as compared to controls. The C. parvum infectious dose was 10 000 oocysts. B and C, Significant initial reduction of parasite burden by BKIs, even in the 
case of higher fecal luciferase levels, which reflect higher parasites load. Parasite excretion rebounds when control animals show a higher infectious burden (8). BKIs 1294 
(100 mg/kg once daily), 1369 (100 mg/kg once daily or 50 mg/kg twice daily), and 1649 (10 mg/kg once daily) efficacies (uninfected control mice had the highest recorded 
levels; C). BKIs substantially reduced Cryptosporidium proliferation, as shown by lower oocyst counts. A once-daily BKI 1369 dose of 100 mg/kg significantly reduced the 
infection burden (by 100 000-fold), relative to that in untreated controls. BKI 1649 was administered at lower doses than other compounds owing to its high oral exposure, 
but it still significantly reduced infection relative to controls. The C. parvum infectious dose was 1000 oocysts. D, BKI 1534 delivered orally at a dose of 60 mg/kg for 5 days 
cleared infection with no recurrence.Assays were performed at the University of Georgia (Athens; A), the University of Washington (Seattle; B and C), and the University of 
Texas Medical Branch (Galveston; D). For assays with results in panels A and B, the percentage inhibition of infection, relative to that in controls, after treatment (day 10) 
was calculated for each compound as follows: 1294, 99.5%; 1534, 99.4%; and 1550, 59.7% (8); and 1294, 99.9%; 1318, 37.6%; 1369, 99.9%; and 1649, 98.9% (8). There 
were 3 mice in each experimental group.

second experiment as compared to the first may have been due 
to the increased infection level, judging by the more rapid onset 
of infection and higher levels of luciferase signal. A recurrent 
rise in infection level was also observed after BKI 1369 treat-
ment (Figure 2B), again perhaps due to the increased infection 
level. However, the level of infection after treatment remained 
at <15% of that for controls, and the mice appeared healthy for 
the duration of the experiment.
The efficacies of BKIs 1294, 1369, and 1649 were tested at 
higher oral doses (Figure 2C). BKI 1369 was administered at 100

1294 that was higher than the 50% effective concentration (EC50) early in the treatment period and to the longer presence of the orally administered 1294 in the lumen relative 
to the subcutaneously administered dose, for which the level after a single dose was below the EC50. C, Efficacy of subcutaneous versus oral dosing with 1534 at 60 mg/kg,

mg/kg orally once daily or at 50 mg/kg orally twice daily, and BKI 
1649 was delivered at 10 mg/kg orally once daily. Compound 1294 
was included at 100 mg/kg orally once daily. The infection in this 
experiment was even more robust, with parasite loads in control 
mice rising to their highest recorded levels. The control mice had 
weight loss requiring euthanasia at day 13 after infection, a week 
earlier than the experiment described in Figure 2B. This infection 
intensity probably led to BKI 1294 having less apparent efficacy 
(Figure 2C) than in previous experiments (Figure 2A and 2B), 
while still significantly reducing infection (P < .05). Nonetheless, 
all BKIs had a substantial effect on infection (Figure 2C). BKI 1369 
at 100 mg/kg once daily significantly reduced the infection (P < 
.05) to levels >100 000 times lower than those in controls. BKI 
1369, when administered at 50 mg/kg twice daily, considerably 
reduced infection levels (P < .05) but with a faster recurrence and 
greater total oocyst excretion, compared with the same total dose 
given once daily. BKI 1649 also significantly reduced infection lev-
els (P < .05) at a dose of 10 mg/kg once daily.
SCID/Beige Mouse C. parvum Model
BKI 1534 was tested in the SCID/beige mouse C. parvum infec-
tion model. BKI 1534 given orally at 60 mg/kg for 5 days cleared 
the infection, with no recurrence (Figure 2D).
BKI Therapy of Highly Established Infection in the IFN-γ KO Mouse 
C. parvum Model
To test the effects of BKIs on higher infection levels, we evalu-
ated the efficacy of our lead inhibitors by delaying dosing to day 
6 after infection in IFN-γ KO mice. BKIs 1294, 1369, and 1534 
were administered orally at 60 mg/kg once daily and BKI 1649 
at 6 mg/kg once daily for 5 days. BKIs 1294 (P < .001), 1369 
(P < .001), 1534 (P < .005), and 1649 (P < .001) all showed a 
significant decrease in the infection level (Figure 3A).
Comparison of Subcutaneous Versus Oral Administration of BKIs
It is unclear whether the optimal anti-Cryptosporidium agent 
should be absorbed systemically and/or retained in the gastro-
intestinal tract [33]. To evaluate subcutaneous administration, 
a single 60 mg/kg dose of BKI 1294 or 1534 was administered 
to uninfected mice. Plasma and fecal levels were measured 
and compared to oral dose pharmacokinetics (Tables 2 and 
3). Subcutaneous delivery of BKI 1294 and 1534 resulted in 
higher systemic exposure and lower fecal concentrations 
than oral delivery, even when considering the different doses 
administered (10 mg/kg orally vs 60 mg/kg subcutaneously in 
single-dose pharmacokinetics analyses). To compare the effi-
cacy of subcutaneous versus oral dosing, mice were given BKI 
1294 or 1534 at 60 mg/kg once daily orally or subcutaneously 
for 5 days, starting on day 6 after infection (Figure 3B and 3C). 
Fecal specimens were collected 24 hours after the fifth dose, to 
measure BKI concentrations (Table 3). The fecal concentration 
of BKI 1294 was only marginally higher after the fifth dose 
delivered subcutaneously, compared with the pharmacokinet-
ics of the subcutaneously delivered single dose, while the fecal 
concentration of BKI 1534 was >10-fold higher after subcutane-
ous delivery of the fifth dose, compared with pharmacokinetics 
of the single dose administered subcutaneously (Table 3). BKI 
1294 showed a significantly greater reduction in infection when 
delivered orally, compared with an equivalent dose delivered 
subcutaneously (P < .05; Figure 3B). However, BKI 1534 did 
not show a significant difference in parasite excretion between 
groups dosed orally and subcutaneously (Figure 3C).
DISCUSSION
A challenge to the development of effective therapy for 
Cryptosporidium infection is the differential efficiency of par-
asite clearance in various in vitro and in vivo models [37, 38]. 
A number of drug candidates have shown good inhibitory activ-
ity in vitro but have demonstrated low potency in clinical mod-
els and were not further considered [39–41]. In addition to C. 
parvum’s natural resistance to many drug therapies, its charac-
teristic subcellular location on the apical-surface of mammalian 
intestinal epithelium cells may constitute a barrier to effective 
drug delivery, preventing drugs from reaching therapeutic con-
centrations in the parasite [42, 43]. This provides the rationale 
for targeting enzymes such as CpCDPK1 that phenotypically 
affect extracellular stages.
Recently, a lack of correlation between anti-Cryptosporidium 
and CpCDPK1 enzyme inhibition for some pyrazolo[2,3-d]
pyrimidine (PP) compounds was reported, suggesting poten-
tial alternative-target activity [34]. The observed c-Src activ-
ity for some BKIs supports this potential for off-target kinase 
activity. BKI 1243 does not have a bumped R1 aryl substitu-
ents at the C-3 position. For all other BKIs used in this study, 
especially with bumped R1, which project into CpCDPK1’s 
enlarged glycine gatekeeper hydrophobic pocket, there is a 
statistically significant correlation between the CpCDPK1 IC50 
and the C. parvum cellular EC50 (r16 = 0.93; P < .0001). This 
suggests that the R1 groups are important in keeping these PP 
BKIs on target (Figure 4). Additionally, antisense methods were

recently used to reduce CpCDPK1 expression [35, 36]. These 
experiments demonstrated that knocking down expression of 
CDPK1 significantly decreased parasite invasion and growth, 
and there was an additive effect with BKIs in reducing the pro-
liferation of C. parvum parasites for BKIs 1294 (PP) and 1517 
(an aminopyrazole-carboxamide compound) [36]. This poten-
tiation of BKI activity when CpCDPK1 expression is reduced 
is further evidence that CpCDPK1 is a target of our BKIs. 
Further chemical-genetic validation experiments are needed to 
test the hypothesis that CpCDPK1 is the primary target of our 
selective BKIs.
There is an observed difference between EC50 values against 
C. parvum in vitro determined using a reverse transcription–
quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assay [20, 
36] and those determined by the Nluc assay reported here. This 
could be attributed to the end point readout of the RT-qPCR 
assay: RNA may degrade faster than the luciferase protein used 
in the Nluc assay. Thus, delayed degradation of luciferase pro-
tein could underestimate compound potency, compared with 
that determined by RT-qPCR. Nevertheless, luminescence 
readouts from Nluc-expressing C. parvum have been previously 
demonstrated to correlate with the level of oocyst shedding 
determined by real-time qPCR using 18S ribosomal RNA prim-
ers and DNA extracted from fecal material [24].
The hERG IC50 of 10 µM for BKI 1369 was initially a reason 
for concern in using the compound in humans. Previous studies 
of hERG suggests that the risk of arrhythmia is reduced for most 
drugs if the hERG IC50 is >30-fold higher than the effective free 
therapeutic plasma concentration [47]. BKI 1369 displayed a 
maximum concentration of 0.26 μM at 10 mg/kg, which was 
40-fold less than its hERG IC50. Additionally, BKI 1369 is 76% 
protein bound in human plasma (Table 1). The low maximum 
concentration and unbound fraction of BKI 1369 should miti-
gate the risks of hERG inhibition [47]. BKI 1294 was efficacious 
in SCID/beige mice [20] and neonatal mice (Table 1) and had 
significant therapeutic effects in the calf clinical model of cryp-
tosporidiosis [21]. The efficacy of BKI 1294 was also demon-
strated using IFN-γ KO mice infected with Nluc-expressing 
C. parvum. BKI 1294 was associated with relapses after treat-
ment in both SCID/beige [20] and IFN-γ KO mouse models. In 
contrast, no relapses were detected with BKI 1534. The congru-
ence of results across models supports the validity of the IFN-γ 
KO model for drug development purposes. A likely explanation 
for recrudescence, especially after high levels of infection are 
cleared, is the limited immunological resistance of this mouse 
strain. They will readily reinfect themselves, owing to factors 
such as oocysts on fur or cage bedding. It is therefore impos-
sible to determine whether infections are recurring because of 
incomplete clearance or reinfection from grooming, coproph-
agy, or exposure to fecal matter from cohabitating mice. Future 
exploration into whether these BKIs will maintain their highly 
efficacious results in larger mammals is warranted.
Differences in efficacy between the neonatal and immuno-
compromised adult mice were observed for some compounds, 
including BKIs 1318 and 1550, which could be due to a number 
of reasons. These include the transient neonatal versus chronic 
IFN-γ KO infection and differential physiological characteris-
tics relating to insufficiently developed neonatal organ-specific 
drug transporters and metabolic systems that may affect drug 
absorption, distribution, and elimination [44–46]. Furthermore, 
BKIs tested showed a lack of association between neonatal effi-
cacy and plasma or fecal exposure in adult mice. Nonetheless, 
intraspecies metabolic barriers may have limited impact on the 
therapeutic outcome for treatment of cryptosporidiosis with 
BKIs, based on successful results of recent calf and SCID/beige 
mouse investigations [20, 21, 35].
In IFN-γ KO mice, there is a lack of correlation between 
BKI systemic exposure (AUC) and Cryptosporidium efficacy 
(r5 = –0.02; P < 1). In contrast, BKIs with high fecal concen-
trations (Table 2) were efficacious. BKIs 1318, 1550, 1553, and 
1649 display the largest plasma AUCs of all compounds tested, 
yet BKI 1649 proved to be the only compound that was effica-
cious. BKIs 1318 and 1550 failed to significantly lower infection 
levels in IFN-γ KO mice, and BKI 1553 was the least effective 
compound of those tested in neonatal calves [21]. All 3 BKIs 
showed fecal concentrations in mice below their respective 50%

effective concentrations (Table 1). However, the fecal concen-
tration of BKI 1649 was much higher at 5.76 µM (Table 2). All 
other BKIs tested that had higher fecal concentrations, includ-
ing BKIs 1294 (4.4 µM), 1369 (5.2 µM), and 1534 (10.1 µM), 
were efficacious in mice despite low systemic exposures. This 
demonstrates that PP-BKI fecal levels correlate with efficacy 
against Cryptosporidium organisms (r5 = 0.78; P < .05), in line 
with the fact that infections localize at the lumen interface 
within the gut [42, 48]. Since fecal levels are imperfect estima-
tors of exposure in the gastrointestinal tract, future studies are 
necessary to examine properties beyond plasma and fecal lev-
els to thoroughly explain the pharmacodynamics of successful 
therapies for cryptosporidiosis.
For efficacy comparison between oral and subcutaneous 
doses, the BKI 1294 fecal concentration after the fifth dose was 
similar to its value after a single dose (Table 3). Fecal exposure 
of BKI 1294 given subcutaneously was around 1 µM, well below 
the 50% effective concentration for this compound. This offers 
a possible explanation for the subcutaneous dose being less effi-
cacious than the equivalent oral dose. For BKI 1534, the fecal 
concentration appeared to rise, with pharmacokinetic analysis 
of the subcutaneously delivered single dose yielding a concen-
tration of 0.44 µM, compared with 4.76 µM after the fifth dose 
(Table 3). This potentially explains the lack of significant dif-
ference between subcutaneous and oral delivery of BKI 1534 
in reducing infection, as subcutaneous administration showed 
that the BKI concentration in feces increased to therapeutic lev-
els by the end of dosing. This could provide an advantage over 
BKI 1294 in species for which oral dosing is difficult. Also, the 
hERG-associated liability is significantly reduced for BKI 1534 
(25 µM) as compared to BKI 1294 (0.76 µM). Overall, the 2 com-
pounds are equally efficacious in this mouse model. Given the 
localization of Cryptosporidium infection in the gastrointestinal 
tract in immunocompetent hosts but biliary and respiratory sites 
in immunocompromised hosts [49, 50], some systemic absorp-
tion is important for optimal efficacy. Further investigations of 
different dosing routes and formulations are needed, especially 
in terms of systemic as compared to gastrointestinal exposure.
