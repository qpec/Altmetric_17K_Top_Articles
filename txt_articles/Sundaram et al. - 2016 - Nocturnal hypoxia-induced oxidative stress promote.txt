Abstract
Background—Oxidative stress is proposed as a central mediator in NAFLD pathogenesis, but 
the specific trigger for reactive oxygen species generation has not been clearly delineated. In 
addition, emerging evidence shows that obesity-related obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and 
nocturnal hypoxia are associated with NAFLD progression in adults.
Aim—To determine if OSA/nocturnal hypoxia induced oxidative stress promotes the progression 
of pediatric NAFLD.

 Methods—Subjects with biopsy proven NAFLD and lean controls were studied. Subjects 
underwent polysomnograms, liver histology scoring, laboratory testing, urine F(2)-isoprostanes 
(measure of lipid peroxidation) and 4-hydroxynonenal liver immunohistochemistry (in situ hepatic 
lipid peroxidation).
Results—We studied 36 adolescents with NAFLD and 14 lean controls. The OSA/hypoxia group 
(69% of NAFLD subjects) had more severe fibrosis (64% Stage 0–2; 36 % Stage 3) than those 
without OSA/hypoxia (100% Stage 0–2), p=0.03. Higher F(2)-isoprostanes correlated with apnea/
hypoxia index (r=0.39, p= 0.03), % time SaO2 <90% (r= 0.56, p=0.0008) and inversely with SaO2 
nadir (r=−0.46, p=0.008). OSA/hypoxia was most severe in subjects with the greatest 4HNE 
staining (p=0.03). Increasing F(2)-isoprostanes(r=0.32, p=0.04) and 4HNE hepatic staining 
(r=0.47, p=0.007) were associated with worsening steatosis. Greater oxidative stress occurred in 
subjects with definite NASH as measured by F(2)-isoprostanes (p=0.06) and hepatic 4HNE 
(p=0.03) compared to those with borderline/not NASH.
Conclusions—These data support the role of nocturnal hypoxia as a trigger for localized hepatic 
oxidative stress, an important factor associated with the progression of NASH and hepatic fibrosis 
in obese pediatric patients.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), characterized by abnormal lipid deposition in 
hepatocytes in the absence of excess alcohol intake, is a disease of epidemic proportions in 
both children and adults, paralleling the obesity epidemic [1]. NAFLD affects up to 9.6% of 
all children and 38% of obese children across a spectrum of disease, including isolated 
hepatic steatosis, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH, defined as steatosis, hepatocyte 
ballooning and inflammation), and cirrhosis [1] [2]. Although isolated hepatic steatosis may 
have no apparent consequences, NASH progresses to liver fibrosis and cirrhosis in about 
20% of cases and is associated with hepatocellular carcinoma in adults [1, 3].
Substantial evidence suggests oxidative stress is a central mediator in NAFLD pathogenesis 
and progression, although the specific trigger for reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation 
has not been clearly delineated. The initial pathology in NAFLD is excessive accumulation 
of hepatocyte lipid as free fatty acids and triglycerides, in part due to insulin resistance. This 
lipid is believed to be the substrate for lipid peroxidation upon exposure to reactive oxygen 
species (ROS), compounded by insufficient scavenging by depressed anti-oxidant defenses 
[4]. Oxidative stress induces cytokine activation, inflammation and fibrogenesis, thus 
promoting the progression from fatty liver to NASH [5]. However, the trigger and source of 
oxidative stress in NAFLD has not been elucidated.
Emerging evidence demonstrates that obesity related obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and 
intermittent nocturnal hypoxia are associated with NAFLD progression. Patients with OSA

 experience repeated episodes of nocturnal hypoxia alternating with normoxia (so called 
chronic intermittent hypoxia), resembling the pathophysiology of ischemia/reperfusion 
injury [6, 7]. In obese mice with hepatic steatosis induced by a high fat, high cholesterol 
diet, exposure to chronic intermittent hypoxia leads to significant increases in ALT and 
histologic evidence of hepatic inflammation and fibrosis [8, 9]. Moreover, morbidly obese 
adults with moderate to severe OSA and hypoxia have more severe hepatic inflammation 
than those without hypoxia [10]. Recent reports demonstrate that pediatric NAFLD patients 
with OSA/hypoxia have more advanced liver disease and fibrosis [11] [12]. While these data 
support a role for OSA/hypoxia in NASH pathogenesis, the mechanism underlying this 
relationship has not been elucidated.
To address nocturnal hypoxia as a potential source of oxidative stress in NAFLD, this study 
was conducted to determine if OSA/nocturnal hypoxia-induced oxidative stress promotes the 
progression of pediatric NAFLD. We hypothesized that systemic and hepatic evidence of 
increased ROS generation would be strongly associated with both nocturnal hypoxia and 
histologic severity of pediatric NAFLD.
Methods
Children cared for at the Children’s Hospital Colorado Pediatric Liver Center between June 
2009 and January 2014 were eligible for this study if they had suspected NAFLD and were 
scheduled to undergo a clinically indicated liver biopsy. In our center, a clinical liver biopsy 
for suspected NAFLD is performed in overweight or obese children (Body Mass Index 
(BMI) > 85% for age and gender) with chronically elevated aminotransferases in whom a 
diagnosis is unclear based on serologic testing, including testing for Wilson’s disease, 
alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, viral hepatitis, and autoimmune hepatitis [13]. Inclusion 
criteria for the study were males and females, ages 8 through 18 years, and Tanner stage 2–4 
with liver biopsy evidence of NAFLD. Liver biopsies were performed for clinical indications 
and not as part of the research protocol. This Tanner stage range was chosen to minimize 
variations in insulin sensitivity that may confound the interpretation of potential associations 
between OSA/hypoxia and NAFLD. Exclusion criteria included the presence of Wilson’s 
disease, alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, viral hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis, other known 
chronic liver disease or cholelithiasis, or use of anticonvulsants, sedatives, corticosteroids, 
drugs that promote or reduce insulin resistance (including insulin sensitizers, 
thiazolidenediones and metformin), or other treatments known to induce hepatic steatosis 
(amiodarone or parenteral nutrition) in the past 2 weeks. Additional exclusion criteria 
included regular tobacco or alcohol use, current use of continuous positive airway pressure 
(CPAP), insulin dependent diabetes, neuromuscular disorders, and genetic or craniofacial 
abnormalities. Data from a subset of these patients has previously been reported [11].
Lean age-matched control subjects (BMI <85%) with no evidence of hepatomegaly or liver 
disease (AST and ALT ≤40 IU/L), Tanner stage 2–4, were also enrolled. Subjects were 
excluded if they had clinical or biochemical evidence of liver disease, with all other 
exclusion criteria the same as for suspected NAFLD subjects. This study was approved by 
the Colorado Multiple Institutional Review Board and informed written consent was 
obtained from parents/guardians and written assent from all subjects.

 At enrollment, demographic data, medical history, physical exam and clinical symptoms of 
sleep apnea (snoring, witnessed apnea, non-restorative sleep, and daytime sleepiness) were 
recorded. A retrospective review of patient charts was conducted to collect height, weight 
and BMI in the 3–6 months prior to study enrollment. Height, weight and BMI at liver 
biopsy were also recorded [14].
Liver biopsies, obtained only for clinical indications by standard percutaneous technique, 
were subsequently examined in this study. Blood hematocrit level, obtained prior to the liver 
biopsy, was recorded. Liver histology (Hematoxylin and Eosin and Masson’s trichrome 
stains) was reviewed and scored by a single pediatric pathologist blinded to subject 
information. Biopsies with histologically confirmed NAFLD (defined as ≥ 5% of 
hepatocytes containing macrovesicular fat) were assigned a grade of necro-inflammation (0–
3) and a stage of fibrosis (0–4) based on the histologic criteria of Brunt et al [15]. Biopsies 
were also scored for steatosis, inflammation, and ballooning degeneration following the 
criteria established by the NASH Clinical Research Network (CRN) [16]. A NAFLD 
Activity Score (NAS) was calculated by summing the scores for steatosis, lobular 
inflammation and ballooning degeneration [16]. In addition, subjects were classified as 
definite NASH (NAS ≥ 5) versus borderline or not NASH (NAS ≤4). Hepatic fibrosis was 
scored as stage 0 [none], stage 1 [mild to moderate perisinusoidal or portal/periportal 
fibrosis only], stage 2 [zone 3 and periportal fibrosis], stage 3 [bridging fibrosis] or stage 4 
[cirrhosis] [16] (20). Subjects were also classified as either Type 1 (classic adult pattern), 
Type 2 (portal-based) or an overlap of the two NASH histologic subtypes [17].
Immunohistochemical analysis of CD163, expressed on activated cells of monocyte/
macrophage origin including Kupffer cells, was performed on paraffin embedded and 
formalin fixed liver tissue using a primary monoclonal mouse antibody raised against 
CD163 (clone MRQ-26, Ventana, Tucson, AZ) [12, 18]. Staining was performed with the 
Benchmark Ventana system. The density of positive cells within the portal tract and liver 
lobule was determined by counting the number of positive cells in an average of ten random 
portal tracts and ten lobular areas at a magnification of ×20 under light microscopy. CD163 
was selected to demonstrate activated immune cells during oxidative stress in the current 
study because it was a significant cell surface marker in a previous study of OSA/hypoxia 
and pediatric NAFLD [12].
Immunohistochemical analysis of 4-hydroxynonenal (4HNE), an in situ marker of lipid 
peroxidation, was performed on paraffin embedded and formalin fixed liver tissue using a 
rabbit polyclonal anti-4-HNE primary antibody (generated and validated by C. Shearn in his 
laboratory in the Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, School of Pharmacy, University of 
Colorado Anschutz Medical Center, Aurora, CO.) and goat anti-rabbit secondary polyclonal 
antibody with a Vectastain ABC IHC kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), as 
previously described [19, 20]. The primary antibody was diluted 1:750 in tris- buffered 
saline plus 5% nonfat dry milk and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The secondary antibody was 
diluted as per manufacturer’s instructions and slides were developed using DAB (3, 3’-
diaminobenzidine) and horseradish peroxidase [19, 20]. The 4HNE immunostains were 
reviewed by a single pediatric pathologist blinded to subject information and scored as 
follows: 0, no staining; 1, cytoplasmic staining within hepatocytes with indistinct granules

 and no staining of fat globules; 2, cytoplasmic staining within hepatocytes with distinct, 
well-formed granules and no staining of fat globules; and 3, cytoplasmic staining within 
hepatocytes with large cytoplasmic granules and distinct staining around the circumference 
of fat globules [21]. Staining was uniform throughout the biopsies and when present, was 
noted within 100% of the hepatocytes.
Following clinical confirmation of NAFLD on liver biopsy, NAFLD subjects underwent a 
standard multi-channel sleep study (polysomnogram), which was scored by a research 
trained technician and interpreted by a single sleep medicine physician, both of whom were 
blinded to liver biopsy results. The following data were analyzed: total sleep time, percent 
REM sleep, apnea/hypopnea index (AHI), oxygen nadir, percent of time O2 saturation 
(SaO2) ≤ 90% and oxygen desaturation index (the number of SaO2 drops below 95% by 
pulse oximeter). The presence of OSA was defined as an apnea/hypopnea index (AHI) > 2.0, 
indicating total apneas and hypopneas per hour of total sleep time [22, 23]. Apnea was 
defined as cessation of airflow over ≥ 2 attempted respiratory cycles and hypopnea was 
defined as a decrease in nasal pressure of ≥50%, with a corresponding decrease in SaO2 of 
≥3% and/or arousal. Hypoxia was defined as SaO2 <90% for ≥ 1% of total sleep time [24]. 
At the time of the polysomnogram, each subjects height, weight and waist circumference 
were measured and BMI calculated [14].
The morning following the sleep study, fasting blood specimens were obtained for serum 
ALT, AST, GGT, ultra- sensitive CRP, total cholesterol, triglyceride, HDL, glucose and 
insulin (used to calculate the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-
IR)) [25]. A first morning urine sample was obtained by clean catch and stored at −70 °C for 
analysis of urine F(2)-isoprostanes by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry, 
and normalized to urine creatinine as a measure of oxidative injury [26, 27]. F(2)-
isoprostanes, prostaglandin like substances formed by non-enzymatic free radical induced 
peroxidation of arachadonic acid, have emerged as reliable markers of in vivo oxidative 
stress [28]. Serum anti-oxidants, alpha tocopherol and alpha and beta carotene, were 
measured on fasting blood specimens by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography and 
normalized to total serum lipid concentrations measured by a spectrophotometric assay in 
the Children’s Hospital Colorado Clinical and Translational Research Center (CTRC) Core 
Laboratory [29].
Lean control subjects were evaluated in the outpatient CTRC facility during an early 
morning appointment. Demographic data, medical history, physical exam and clinical 
symptoms of sleep apnea (snoring, witnessed apnea, non-restorative sleep, and daytime 
sleepiness) were recorded. Height, weight and waist circumference were measured and BMI 
calculated [14]. Similar to NAFLD subjects, lean control subjects had fasting blood 
specimens obtained for serum ALT, AST, GGT, ultra- sensitive CRP, total cholesterol, 
triglyceride, HDL, glucose, insulin, total lipids and serum alpha tocopherol and alpha and 
beta carotene. They also provided a urine sample for F(2)-isoprostane analysis. Lean control 
subjects did not undergo liver biopsy or polysomnogram.
Statistical analyses were performed using SAS 9.3 software (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, 
USA). Descriptive statistics are presented as either mean ± SD for continuous measures or

 percentages for categorical responses. Two sample t-test, chi square or Fisher’s exact test 
were used, as appropriate, to assess differences between subjects with and without OSA/
hypoxia. In addition, to account for the potential confounding effect of BMI changes over 
time in subjects with and without OSA/hypoxia, a linear regression analysis was performed 
when appropriate. Pearson or Spearman correlation coefficient, as appropriate, was used to 
quantify the relationships between ALT, AST and histologic parameters with 
polysomnographic parameters and oxidative stress measurements. Ln transformation was 
applied to Urine F(2)- isoprostanes and arcsine-root transformation was applied to 
proportional type polysomnographic data, such as percent time with SaO2 < 90%, however, 
results are presented in the original scale for ease of interpretation. A p value < 0.05 was 
considered statistically significant.
Results
Thirty-six obese subjects with liver biopsy confirmed NAFLD were studied (Supplementary 
Figure 1); 67% were male, 89% Hispanic, with a mean age of 12.9 ± 1.9 years, and mean 
BMI of 32.3 ± 5.5 (Table 1). Fourteen lean controls were studied; 50% were male, 36 % 
Hispanic, with a mean age of 13.1 ± 1.8 years, and mean BMI of 18.9 ± 2.3. As expected, 
NAFLD subjects had significantly (p<0.05) elevated aminotransferases, inflammatory 
markers and evidence of the metabolic syndrome, as compared to lean controls (Table 1).
Relationship of OSA/hypoxia to NAFLD
Twenty five NAFLD subjects (69 %) met the study criteria for OSA and/or nocturnal 
hypoxia: 1 had isolated hypoxia; 15 isolated OSA and 9 subjects had both OSA and 
hypoxia. NAFLD subjects with and without OSA/hypoxia reported similar symptoms of 
sleep disordered breathing (Table 2). There were no significant differences in elapsed time 
between performance of liver biopsy and polysomnogram between subjects with (111 ± 94 
days) and without (108 ± 71 days) OSA/hypoxia, p=0.9. There were also no significant 
changes in BMI in subjects with and without OSA/hypoxia from 3–6 months prior to liver 
biopsy, to the time of biopsy and at polysomnogram (Table 2). In addition, linear regression 
analyses adjusting for BMI over time showed no difference from unadjusted models. In all 
NAFLD subjects, polysomnograms were of adequate length and >12% of total sleep time 
was spent in REM sleep, allowing all studies to be considered valid (Table 2). NAFLD 
subjects with OSA/hypoxia had a significantly higher (p<0.001) mean AHI score (8.5 ± 7.6) 
versus those without OSA/hypoxia (1.0 ± 0.6 than), indicating moderate to severe sleep 
disordered breathing. While oxygen nadirs were similar in those with OSA/hypoxia 
compared to those without OSA/hypoxia (83.3 ± 6.1 % vs. 87.2 ± 23.4 %, p=0.06), the 
percent of sleep time spent with SaO2 less than 90% was significantly longer (2.1 ± 3.6 vs. 
0.1 ± 0.2, p=0.01) and oxygen desaturation index higher (13.6 ± 24.2 versus 2.3 ± 4.0, 
p=0.03) in those with OSA/hypoxia. These differences were not explained by differences in 
age, gender, ethnicity, BMI, waist circumference, clinical symptoms or laboratory testing 
(Table 2). Subjects with OSA/hypoxia had higher blood hematocrit (43.5 ± 2.6 %) compared 
to subjects without OSA (41.3 ± 1.9 %), p=0.03. Moreover, there were no significant 
correlations between hematocrit and AHI, oxygen nadir, percent of sleep time spent with 
SaO2 less than 90% or oxygen desaturation index higher (data not shown).

 NAFLD subjects with definite NASH (NAS histologic score ≥ 5, n=23) had more severe 
sleep disordered breathing compared to those without definite NASH (NAS score < 5, 
n=13). Subjects with definite NASH had significantly higher (p=0.04) mean AHI scores (7.7 
± 8.5) than those without definite NASH (3.5 ± 2.7). Subjects with definite NASH also spent 
significantly more time (p=0.01) with oxygen SaO2 less than 90% (2.2 ± 3.7) than those 
without definite NASH (0.17 ± 0.33). There were no differences in oxygen nadir or oxygen 
desaturation index between those with and without definite NASH (data not shown).
NAFLD subjects with and without OSA /hypoxia had similarly elevated aminotransferases, 
HDL, triglycerides, total cholesterol, inflammatory markers and evidence of insulin 
resistance (Table 2). Liver histology scores for steatosis, inflammation, ballooning 
degeneration, NAS summary score (Mean NAS: 4.84 ± 1.28 vs. 4.82 ± 1.40) and histologic 
grade were also similar in those with and without OSA/hypoxia (Supplementary Table 1). 
However, NAFLD subjects with OSA/hypoxia had more severe fibrosis (60% Stage 0–2; 
40 % Stage 3) than those without OSA/hypoxia (100% Stage 0–2), p=0.03. There were no 
differences in the distribution of histologic Type 1 versus Type 2 NAFLD in subjects with 
and without OSA/hypoxia.
NAFLD subjects with and without OSA /hypoxia had similar numbers of CD163+ cells in 
both portal and lobular areas (Table 2). A significant relationship was found between lobular 
but not portal CD163+ cells and ALT (r=−0.40, p=0.04) and portal but not lobular CD163+ 
cells and fibrosis stage (r=0.40, p=0.02). There were no significant correlations between 
portal or lobular CD163+ cells and AHI, oxygen nadir, histologic grade, degree of steatosis, 
inflammation, ballooning or NAS summary score (data not shown).
We next examined relationships (r values) between key polysomnographic measurements 
and markers of NAFLD disease severity (aminotransferases and histologic parameters) 
across all NAFLD subjects. A significant relationship was found between aminotransferase 
values and % time with SaO2 ≤90% (Figure 1A and 1B). Moreover, an increasing 
percentage of time with SaO2 ≤ 90% was associated with increasing hepatic steatosis (r=0.4, 
p=0.01), inflammation grade (r=0.31, p=0.06) and NAS summary score (r=0.32, p=0.05) 
(Figure 1C, 1D and 1E). In addition, a significant relationship was found between hematocrit 
and NAFLD fibrosis stage (r=0.36, p=0.03), but not other histologic parameters. There were 
no significant correlations between the AHI, oxygen nadir or oxygen desaturation index and 
histologic grade, fibrosis stage, degree of steatosis, inflammation, ballooning or NAS 
summary score (data not shown).
Relationship of OSA/hypoxia and Oxidative Stress
Urine F(2)-isoprostanes normalized to urine creatinine were utilized as a biomarker of 
oxidative stress. Urine F(2)-isoprostanes were significantly higher (p=0.04) in NAFLD with 
(725 ± 53 pg/mg creatinine) and without OSA/hypoxia (573 ± 85 pg/mg creatinine) 
compared to lean controls (310 ± 77 pg/mg creatinine). Higher levels of F(2)-isoprostanes in 
NAFLD subjects correlated with more severe sleep apnea, denoted by the AHI (r=0.39, 
p=0.03), and more severe hypoxia, denoted by percent time SaO2 was less than 90% 
(r=0.56, p=0.0008), oxygen nadir (r= −0.46, p=0.008) and oxygen desaturation index 
(r=0.45, p=0.01) (Figure 2A, 2B, 2C and 2D). A strong correlation was observed between

 urine F(2)-isoprostanes and 4HNE liver immunohistochemistry, a marker of in situ hepatic 
lipid peroxidation (r=0.56, p=0.002). Representative images of mild 4HNE staining (score of 
1) versus severe staining (score of 3) are shown in Figure 3A and 3B. Sleep disordered 
breathing was most severe in subjects with the greatest 4HNE staining. NAFLD subjects 
with 4HNE scores of 1 had a mean AHI of 2.83 ± 1.26 and spent 0.10 ± 0.14 % of total 
sleep time with SaO2 < 90% compared to those with elevated 4HNE scores of 2/3 who had a 
mean AHI of 6.23 ± 7.24 and spent 1.46 ± 3.06 % of total sleep time with SaO2 < 90% 
(p=0.03), Figures 3C and 3D. Thus, evidence of hepatic oxidative stress in NAFLD was 
associated with more severe sleep apnea and nocturnal hypoxia.
Relationship of Oxidative Stress and Liver Histology
Next we examined the relationship between oxidative stress and liver histology. Increasing 
F(2)-isoprostanes(r=0.32, p=0.04, Figure 2E) and hepatic lipid peroxidation by 4HNE 
staining (r=0.47, p=0.007) were associated with worsening steatosis, but not with 
inflammation, ballooning degeneration, or fibrosis. However, greater lipid peroxidation 
occurred in subjects with definite NASH (NAS score ≥ 5, n=23), with F(2)-isoprostanes 
values of 753 ± 308 pg/mg creatinine, compared to those without definite NASH (NAS score 
< 5, n=13), with values of 548 ± 204 pg/mg urine creatinine, p=0.06 (Figure 2F). Similarly, 
4HNE staining (hepatic lipid peroxidation) was significantly (p=0.03) more marked in 
subjects with definite NASH (2.53 ± 0.6) compared to those without definite NASH (2.0 
± 0.7) (Figure 3E). Moreover, the severity of 4HNE staining correlated with increasing ALT 
(r=0.40, p=0.02) (Figure 3F). Thus, hepatic oxidative stress was associated with definite 
NASH and evidence of hepatocellular injury. There were no significant correlations between 
the numbers of portal or lobular CD163+ cells and urine F(2)-isoprostanes or hepatic 4HNE.
Relationship of Anti-oxidants to NAFLD and Lipid Peroxidation
Selected circulating serum anti-oxidants were measured and normalized to serum total lipids 
in NAFLD and lean control subjects. NAFLD subjects had lower serum alpha tocopherol 
and beta carotene levels compared to lean control subjects (Table 1). These difference in 
anti-oxidant levels were most striking between NAFLD subjects with OSA/hypoxia and lean 
subjects (p <0.01) (data not shown). There were no differences in antioxidants between 
NAFLD subjects with and without OSA/hypoxia. However, alpha tocopherol/total lipid and 
beta carotene /total lipid ratios were inversely related to elevations of AST and ALT (Figure 
4A, 4B, 4C and 4D), but not to liver histology. No significant correlations were found 
between alpha carotene/total lipid ratio and AST, ALT or liver histology. In addition, no 
differences in measured antioxidants were found between NAFLD subjects with and without 
definite NASH. Furthermore, measured anti-oxidant levels did not correlate with AHI, 
oxygen nadir or percent time SaO2 was less than 90%. Thus, antioxidant status was not 
related to the presence of OSA/hypoxia although it did correlate with biochemical evidence 
of liver injury.
In contrast, alpha-tocopherol/total lipids (r= −0.27, p=0.07) and beta carotene/total lipids (r=
−0.48, p=0.001) were inversely correlated with urinary F(2)-isoprostanes(Figure 4E and 4F). 
In addition, lower beta-carotene/total lipid ratios (p<0.01) were found in NAFLD subjects 
with 4HNE staining scores of 2 (mean: 0.01 ± 0.005 mg/gm) or 3 (mean: 0.01 ± 0.008

 mg/gm) compared to those with minimal 4HNE staining scores of 1 (0.04 ± 0.06 mg/gm). 
Thus, antioxidant levels were inversely related to the measures of oxidative stress and 
hepatic lipid peroxidation.
Discussion
The results of this study provide evidence implicating OSA/nocturnal hypoxia as a trigger of 
oxidative stress and injury that promotes the progression of pediatric NASH. In addition, this 
study confirms that OSA/hypoxia is common in pediatric NAFLD and that more severe 
OSA/hypoxia is associated with elevated aminotransferases, hepatic steatosis, inflammation, 
NAS and fibrosis. Higher blood hematocrit levels, a potential biomarker of chronic hypoxia, 
were also associated with more severe hepatic fibrosis. Moreover, patients with definite 
NASH experience more severe obstructive sleep apnea and hypoxia than those without 
definite NASH. The results of this study support the role of nocturnal hypoxia in obese 
pediatric patients in inducing localized hepatic oxidative stress, a factor associated with the 
progression of NASH and hepatic fibrosis [5]. These data also implicate low antioxidant 
status as an additional independent risk factor for hepatic oxidative stress in NAFLD.
In this study, we used two validated markers of oxidative stress-induced lipid peroxidation, 
urinary excretion of F(2)-isoprostanes and hepatic staining for 4HNE adducts. Studies in 
animal models of NAFLD demonstrate increased free radical generation in the liver, 
indicated by increased mitochondrial superoxide radical generation and induction of 
CYP2E1 isoforms [30] [31]. Adults with NASH have elevated serum markers of oxidative 
stress (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances [TBARS], oxidized LDL, oxidized glutathione 
and malonyldialdehyde) compared to those with simple steatosis and/or controls [4, 32, 33]. 
Limited pediatric data utilizing serum TBARS or malondialdehyde (MDA) suggest 
increased oxidative stress in children with NAFLD [34] [35]. Although widely used, both 
TBARSs and MDA can be formed by multiple oxidants and are suboptimal for analysis of 
active lipid oxidation species in vivo [28] [36]. Isoprostanes, a series of stable prostaglandin-
like compounds formed by non-enzymatic, free radical-catalyzed peroxidation of 
arachadonic acid, have emerged as validated biomarkers of lipid peroxidation that are well 
suited for non-invasive measurement of systemic oxidative stress [28]. Using this biomarker, 
we show that oxidative stress was significantly higher in children with NAFLD, both with 
and without OSA/hypoxia, compared to healthy, lean children. Importantly, increasing F(2)-
Isoprostanes were associated with worsening histologic steatosis and definite NASH (NAS 
score ≥ 5). In this study, we demonstrated a strong relationship between urine F(2)-
isoprostanes and hepatic 4HNE immunostaining, suggesting that urinary excretion of F(2)-
isoprostanes reflected ongoing hepatic oxidative injury in our patients.
As a major aldehyde metabolite of lipid peroxidation, 4HNE is a reliable marker of in situ 
lipid peroxidation. Increasing formation of stable 4HNE protein adducts have been described 
in the oxidative injury that occurs in several chronic liver diseases, including viral hepatitis, 
hereditary hemochromatosis, alcoholic liver disease and adult NAFLD [21] [37] [38] [39]. 
Using similar 4-HNE immunohistochemical methodology, we have demonstrated evidence 
of increased oxidative injury in the liver of pediatric NAFLD patients that was most 
pronounced in those with severe sleep disordered breathing, supporting our hypothesis that

 OSA and nocturnal hypoxia are significant triggers of hepatic oxidative stress and NAFLD 
progression. Moreover, 4HNE is a strong neutrophil chemo-attractant and may also attract 
hepatic stellate cells [37] [21], providing a plausible physiologic explanation for its role in 
disease and fibrosis progression.
In obstructive sleep apnea, liver tissue is subjected to repeated episodes of nocturnal hypoxia 
and normoxia, resembling the pathophysiology of ischemia/reperfusion injury. During 
hypoxia, cells adapt to a lower than normal oxygen environment, but with normoxia due to 
subsequent re-oxygenation, there is a sudden increase in oxygen consumption with enhanced 
mitochondrial generation of ROS and oxidative stress [40, 41]. This relationship has been 
established experimentally wherein animals subjected to intermittent cycles of hypoxia 
demonstrate elevated markers of oxidative stress [42] [43] [44] [45]. This effect may be 
mediated in part by alterations in oxygen responsive hypoxia inducible factor (HIF-1α) and 
nuclear factor kappa B (NF-ĸB), thereby triggering the production of cytotoxic, pro-
inflammatory (e.g., tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α)) and fibrogenic mediators by 
Kupffer cells and hepatic stellate cells [45] [46], as summarized in Figure 5. This is 
supported by the significant correlation between CD163+ cells, suggestive of Kuppfer cell 
activation, and liver fibrosis noted in this as well as previous studies [12] [18]. Alterations in 
gut permeability with resultant endotoxemia in patients with NAFLD and OSA/hypoxia 
suggest an additional mechanistic link between nocturnal hypoxia, inflammatory activation 
and NASH [47].
Increased oxidative stress has been reported in adults with OSA compared to healthy 
controls, which improves following Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) treatment 
[48–50]. Other studies, however, suggested that oxidative stress in OSA patients was related 
to obesity rather than intermittent hypoxia [51] [52]. Limited small pediatric studies also 
have yielded conflicting results. Elevated plasma oxidized LDL and exhaled breath 
concentrate levels of hydrogen peroxide and 8-Isoprostane levels were reported in children 
with OSA [53] [54]. However, in other reports, urinary F(2) - Isoprostanes were not 
correlated with sleep disordered breathing [55, 56]. In contrast, our study demonstrates a 
clear relationship between oxidative stress and the severity of sleep apnea and hypoxia in 
obese children with NAFLD, both systemically and specifically in the liver. We speculate 
that nocturnal CPAP therapy may be a potential treatment modality for pediatric NAFLD 
patients with OSA/hypoxia, exerting its effect by reducing intermittent nocturnal hypoxia-
induced oxidative stress.
In addition to increased ROS generation, insufficient anti-oxidant defenses may compound 
oxidative injury in NAFLD. In adults, reduced levels of the hepatic anti-oxidants coenzyme 
Q10 and glutathione correlated with the severity of NAFLD, as did serum and hepatic retinol 
stores[4] [57]. In children, reduced serum beta-carotene and alpha tocopherol were 
associated with NAFLD [58, 59]. These relationships formed the basis for clinical trials of 
alpha tocopherol supplementation in adult and pediatric NAFLD patients [60, 61]. In 
contrast, no clear relationship of anti-oxidant levels with OSA has been reported. On the one 
hand, decreased total anti-oxidant status was described in adults with OSA compared to 
healthy controls and an inverse linear relationship between anti-oxidant capacity and AHI in 
adults was reported [48, 62]. However, others have observed lower total anti-oxidant levels

 in adults with mild to moderate but not severe OSA[63]. In the present study, lower serum 
alpha tocopherol and beta carotene normalized to total serum lipids were observed in 
NAFLD patients with OSA/hypoxia compared to lean controls. NAFLD subjects with the 
highest aminotransferases were found to have lower alpha tocopherol and beta carotene. 
Consistent with the adult experience, anti-oxidant levels did not relate to severity of sleep 
disordered breathing in our NAFLD subjects. However, NAFLD subjects exhibiting the 
highest levels of F(2)-isoprostanes and hepatic 4HNE immunohistochemical staining 
manifested the lowest anti-oxidant levels. Thus, lower anti-oxidant levels in NAFLD patients 
may be an additional independent risk factor promoting oxidative stress, unrelated to the 
presence of OSA/hypoxia.
The limitations of this study include the modest sample size, raising the possibility of a type 
2 error in detecting relationships between OSA/hypoxia, oxidative stress and severity of 
NAFLD. While this largely Hispanic male cohort of subjects reflects the demographics of 
pediatric NAFLD in the United States, these findings may not be generalizable to other 
populations. Furthermore, the lean control group in this study was disproportionately non-
Hispanic white, reflecting racial disparities in BMI among children in the United States [64]. 
In addition, our sample may be biased towards more severe liver disease as all enrolled 
NAFLD subjects underwent liver biopsy for clinical indications that included chronic 
elevation of aminotransferases. Finally, although we recognize that visceral adiposity and its 
associated adipocytokines may be important in both NAFLD and OSA, this study did not 
include an obese control group without these diseases [65, 66]. However, similarities noted 
in waist circumference, a surrogate for visceral adiposity [67] [68], serum leptin and 
adiponectin between those with and without OSA/hypoxia suggest that these factors were 
not major confounders in this study.
In conclusion, this study demonstrates a strong association between OSA/hypoxia in obese 
adolescents, evidence of increased systemic and hepatic oxidative stress and reduced 
circulating antioxidants with more advanced NAFLD histology and aminotransferase 
elevation. These data support sleep disordered breathing as an important trigger of oxidative 
stress that promotes progression of pediatric NAFLD to NASH. Further proof of this 
hypothesis will require additional investigations to demonstrate prevention or reversal of 
NASH following effective therapy of OSA and nocturnal hypoxia in obese patients.

 Lay Summary
Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and low nighttime oxygen are associated with NAFLD 
progression in adults. In this study, we show that adolescents with NAFLD who have 
OSA and low oxygen have significant scar tissue in their livers. NAFLD subjects affected 
by OSA and low oxygen have a greater imbalance between the production of free radicals 
and their body’s ability to counteract their harmful effects than subjects without OSA and 
low oxygen. This study shows that low oxygen levels may be an important trigger in the 
progression of pediatric NASH.

Nocturnal hypoxia is associated with the degree of aminotransferase elevation and histologic 
disease severity in pediatric NAFLD. A significant relationship was observed between % 
time with SaO2 ≤ 90% and elevations of AST (A) and ALT (B), as well as hepatic steatosis 
(C), inflammation grade (D) and NAFLD Activity Score (E).

Severity of OSA and nocturnal hypoxia are associated with increasing oxidative stress 
(urinary F (2)-Isoprostanes) in pediatric NAFLD: AHI (A), % time with SaO2 ≤ 90% (B), 
oxygen nadir (C) and oxygen desaturation index (D). In addition, oxidative stress is 
associated with worsening histologic steatosis (E) and NAFLD disease severity (F).

Representative liver histology demonstrates examples of mild 4HNE staining (4HNE score 
of 1) with the presence of minimal cytoplasmic staining and indistinct granules (A) and 
severe 4HNE staining (4HNE score of 3) with distinct staining of fat globules and 
cytoplasmic staining (B). NAFLD subjects with low 4HNE scores had lower AHI scores (C) 
and spent less of their total sleep time with SaO2 < 90% (D) compared to those with higher 
4HNE scores. Subjects with definite NASH had more marked 4HNE staining than those

Several underlying mechanisms may explain the progression of NAFLD by oxidative stress. 
Obese individuals are prone to insulin resistance and hyperlipidemia, which may lead to 
both hyperglycemia and increased free fatty acids with resultant hepatic steatosis and 
lipotoxicity. Multiple pathways including sleep apnea and chronic intermittent hypoxia may 
lead to ROS generation. Oxidative hepatic injury may result from direct attack of ROS on 
essential biomolecules, including lipids, proteins and DNA, with subsequent activation of 
cell death pathways and loss of biologic function and hepatocyte viability. In addition to 
direct attack, ROS may indirectly activate redox sensitive transcription factors, including 
NFKB and HIF-1, thereby triggering the production of cytoxic, pro-inflammatory and 
fibrogenic mediators by Kupffer cells and hepatic stellate cells, promoting NAFLD disease 
progression [69] [70] [71].
