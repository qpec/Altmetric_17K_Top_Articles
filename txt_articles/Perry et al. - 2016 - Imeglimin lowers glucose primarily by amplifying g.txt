RG. Imeglimin lowers glucose primarily by amplifying glucose-
stimulated insulin secretion in high-fat-fed rodents. Am J Physiol
Endocrinol Metab 311: E461–E470, 2016. First published July 12,
2016; doi:10.1152/ajpendo.00009.2016.—Imeglimin is a promising
new oral antihyperglycemic agent that has been studied in clinical
trials as a possible monotherapy or add-on therapy to lower fasting
plasma glucose and improve hemoglobin A1c (1–3, 9). Imeglimin was
shown to improve both fasting and postprandial glycemia and to
increase insulin secretion in response to glucose during a hypergly-
cemic clamp after 1-wk of treatment in type 2 diabetic patients.
However, whether the �-cell stimulatory effect of imeglimin is solely
or partially responsible for its effects on glycemia remains to be fully
confirmed. Here, we show that imeglimin directly activates �-cell
insulin secretion in awake rodents without affecting hepatic insulin
sensitivity, body composition, or energy expenditure. These data
identify a primary amplification rather than trigger the �-cell mech-
anism that explains the acute, antidiabetic activity of imeglimin.
imeglimin; �-cell; glucose-stimulated insulin secretion
IMEGLIMIN IS A NEW ORAL ANTIHYPERGLYCEMIC AGENT that has been
studied in clinical trials as a possible monotherapy or add-on
therapy to lower fasting plasma glucose and improve hemo-
globin A1c (2, 3, 9). Imeglimin was shown to improve both
fasting and postprandial glycemia (1) and increase insulin
secretion in response to glucose during a hyperglycemic clamp
after 1 wk of treatment in type 2 diabetic patients (8). Improve-
ments in glucose tolerance have been reported in both humans
and rodents treated with imeglimin and have been ascribed to
multiple mechanisms: lower hepatic lipids (12), improved liver
and muscle insulin signaling (12), and improved �-cell func-
tion (3, 12). However, prior studies have not utilized the
gold-standard technique to evaluate hepatic insulin sensitivity:
the hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp. Of note is that, al-
though the mechanism of action of imeglimin has been as-
cribed at least in part to improved insulin sensitivity (12),
improved insulin sensitivity would be expected to result in
reductions in plasma insulin concentrations, not the increases
that have been noted in multiple human (8, 9) and rodent (12)
studies. Importantly, previous papers have not included in vitro
studies to determine whether imeglimin increases glucose-
stimulated insulin secretion directly or indirectly. In addition,
most of the prior studies performed with imeglimin were
long-term (months-long) treatment studies, which do not allow
researchers to identify the first beneficial effects of the drug. To
this end, we performed intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests
(GTT) and hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamps in chow- and
high-fat fed rats treated with imeglimin for 2 wk, thereby
conclusively demonstrating the mechanism by which imeg-
limin improves glycemia in the high-fat fed rat using a com-
prehensive toolkit of gold-standard in vitro and in vivo tech-
niques. Furthermore, we assessed glucose-stimulated insulin
secretion in isolated rat islets and identified a direct, glucose-
dependent, amplifying mechanism of action that would explain
the absence of hypoglycemia when used at recommended
pharmacological concentrations in humans.
METHODS
Animals. All animal protocols were approved by the Yale Univer-
sity Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, and all guidelines
in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (8th Ed.) were
followed. Because metabolic cages could be used only for mice, male
C57BL/6 mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory at 8 wk of
age and were placed on chow or a lard-based high-fat diet (HFD). They
were treated twice daily with imeglimin (150 mg/kg) mixed into a small
amount of peanut butter or an equal amount of peanut butter vehicle.
Mice underwent metabolic cage analysis (Columbus Instruments, Co-
lumbus, OH) after 1 and 3 wk of treatment in the chow-fed group or after
1 and 5 wk of treatment in the HFD-fed group.
All other animal studies involved Male Sprague-Dawley rats that
were purchased from Charles River Laboratories at 350 g and were
placed on chow or a safflower oil-based HFD. After 2 wk on the diet, they
were treated twice daily for 2 wk with imeglimin (150 mg/kg) in peanut
butter or peanut butter vehicle while they were maintained on the diet.
After the first week of treatment, they underwent surgery under general
isoflurane anesthesia to place polyethylene catheters in the carotid artery
and jugular vein, and after 1 wk of recovery and an overnight fast they
underwent intraperitoneal GTT (1 g/kg glucose). The final dose of
imeglimin was given 15 min prior to the start of the GTT. Blood (200 �l
at each draw) was taken from the venous catheter 0, 5, 10, 15, 30, 45, 60,
and 90 min after the glucose bolus and immediately placed in heparin-
coated tubes, and plasma was isolated after centrifugation for analysis of
plasma glucose and insulin concentrations.

 In the clamp studies, rats were again studied after a total of 4 wk
of diet feeding, during the last 2 wk of which they were treated with
imeglimin (150 mg/kg twice daily in peanut butter or peanut butter
vehicle). Following an overnight fast, a 120-min basal infusion of
[6,6-2H2]glucose (1 mg·kg�1·min�1 prime for 5 min, followed by a
0.25 mg·kg�1·min�1 continuous infusion) was administered, with 200
�l of whole blood taken after 100, 110, and 120 min of infusion to
measure glucose turnover, as described below. The final dose of
imeglimin was given 15 min prior to the start of the basal infusion.
Immediately following the basal infusion, 120-min hyperinsulinemic
euglycemic clamps were performed. Rats received arterial infusions
of insulin (prime: 40 mU/kg over 5 min; followed by a continuous
dose: 4 mU·kg�1·min�1) for the duration of the clamp. Euglycemia
(100–110 mg/dl) was maintained with a variable infusion of D20
[6,6-2H2]glucose (99 atom% excess). Blood samples (50 �l) were
taken every 15 min for measurement of glucose using a YSI glucose
analyzer (Yellow Springs Instruments, Yellow Springs, OH). After
120 min, 20 mCi of 2-[14C]deoxyglucose was injected through the
venous line, and glucose uptake was measured in skeletal muscle
(quadriceps), as described previously (4). Twenty minutes after ad-

 ministration of the 2-[14C]deoxyglucose, rats were euthanized with
intravenous pentobarbital, and liver and quadriceps were rapidly
freeze-clamped in aluminum tongs precooled in liquid N2.
Biochemical analysis. Plasma glucose concentrations were mea-
sured biochemically using a YSI Glucose Analyzer (Yellow Springs
Instruments), and plasma insulin was measured by radioimmunoassay
by the Yale Diabetes Research Core.
Western blots. Pan-acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) phosphorylation
and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation were measured by
Western blot (14) in overnight-fasted rat liver 2 h following the last
imeglimin dose, with antibodies obtained from Cell Signaling Technol-
ogy. Equal protein loading was confirmed by measuring GAPDH protein
content (antibody from Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in each blot.
Insulin secretion in isolated islets. Intact islets isolated from
�300-g Sprague-Dawley rats were hand-picked and layered between
acrylamide gel column beads [Bio-Gel P4G (156-4124)] in perifusion/
static incubation media [DMEM (Sigma D5030) supplemented with
NaHCO3 as per the manufacturer’s instructions, 10 mM HEPES, 4
mM glutamine, 0.2% fatty acid free BSA, and 2.5 mM glucose].
Eighty islets for each condition were perifused at a rate of 100 �l/min
on an eight- or 12-channel BioRep Technologies (Miami, FL) peri-
fusion device. Islets were equilibrated on the instrument in basal (2.5

 mM) glucose perifusion media with or without imeglimin (100 �M)
for 45 min prior to sample collection in a 5% CO2-95% air, 37°C
constant environment. For static secretion assays, intact islets were
dispersed using accutase (Gibco) and reaggregated to form single
pseudoislet aggregates. Following dispersion into single cells, the cell
suspension was seeded at 5,000 cells/well of a 96-well V-bottom plate
and cultured under the same conditions as the intact islets. Pseudoislet
aggregates formed 12–24 h after incubation at 37°C and 5% CO2-95%
air. Rat insulin was measured in the perifusate/incubation media using a
high-range rat insulin ELISA (Alpco, Salem, NH) and normalized to total
islet DNA concentration using Quant-it PicoGreen dsDNA Assay Kit
(Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). Secretagogues included the glucoki-
nase activator (MK-0941), tolbutamide, exendin-4 (Tocris), L-leucine,
forskolin, and monomethyl ester of succinic acid (SAME) at the
indicated concentrations.

Food intake was different only after 1 wk of treatment (Figs. 1
and 2). Similarly, in chow- and HFD-fed mice treated chron-
ically (3–5 wk) with imeglimin, there were no differences seen
in body composition, food and water intake, or energetics
compared with vehicle-treated controls (Figs. 3 and 4).
Imeglimin-treated rats exhibit improved glucose tolerance
due to increased insulin secretion in vivo. In chow-fed rats, 2
wk of imeglimin treatment resulted in a striking improvement
in glucose tolerance, with lower plasma glucose concentra-
tions throughout the GTT (Fig. 5, A and B). Imeglimin-
treated rats exhibited 30–100% increases in insulin secre-
tion at each time point during the GTT, with more than a
doubling in the insulin area under the curve during the GTT
(Fig. 5, C and D). These results were replicated in high-fat-
fed (HFD) rats; imeglimin improved glucose tolerance by
increasing insulin secretion throughout a GTT after a 2-wk
treatment period (Fig. 6, A–D).

 muscle insulin sensitivity, we performed hyperinsulinemic eu-
glycemic clamps and observed no difference in the glucose
infusion rate required to maintain euglycemia, in basal or
clamped hepatic glucose production, or in peripheral muscle
glucose disposal during the clamp (Fig. 7, C–G). Similarly, in
HFD rats, there were no differences in hepatic or muscle
insulin sensitivity, as indicated by the absence of any differ-
ences in glucose infusion rate, hepatic glucose production, or
muscle glucose uptake after 2 wk of imeglimin treatment (Fig.
8, A–E).
Imeglimin amplifies rather than triggers insulin secretion.
To determine whether imeglimin directly stimulates �-cell
insulin secretion, we measured glucose-stimulated insulin se-
cretion by isolated islet perifusion and static incubations.
Adding imeglimin to previously untreated rat islets at 100 �M,
a dose previously demonstrated to stimulate glucose-stimulated
insulin secretion (12), caused an immediate increase in glu-
cose-stimulated insulin secretion (Fig. 9A). An area under the
curve analysis identified the mitochondrial metabolism-depen-
dent second phase of insulin secretion accounting for the bulk
of the increase (Fig. 9B). Compared with other islet secreta-
gogues, insulin secretion appeared to be dependent upon glu-
cose metabolism up to a concentration of 1 mM imeglimin
(Fig. 9C). The glucose dependency displayed a graded ampli-
fying behavior, except at concentrations �5 mM (well above
its therapeutic target range), where it triggered insulin release
even at low glucose (Fig. 9, D and E). To determine whether
imeglimin was dependent on glycolytic and/or mitochondrial
metabolism, islet perifusions were performed using obligate
mitochondrial fuels such as leucine and succinate (Fig. 9, F, G,

 I, and J). In the presence of glutamine, 10 mM leucine
stimulates insulin secretion by activating glutamate dehydro-
genase and supplies both anaplerotic and oxidative pathways of
mitochondrial metabolism. Leucine-stimulated secretion was
higher than glucose-stimulated secretion and was not amplified
further by 1 mM imeglimin (Fig. 9, F and G). However, in
contrast to the perifusions at increasing concentrations of
leucine in static incubations, imeglimin actually amplified
secretion, suggesting that the lack of an observed difference in
the perifusion could be attributed to having reached maximal
insulin release (Fig. 9H). Like leucine, the methyl ester of
succinate (SAME) has both anaplerotic and oxidative metab-
olism but showed only a trend toward being amplified by
imeglimin (Fig. 9, I and J). Taken together, these data imply
that the primary mechanism of action of imeglimin is via an
amplification of mitochondrial metabolism-dependent signals
that stimulate insulin release.
DISCUSSION
The attractive safety and efficacy profile of imeglimin in
poorly controlled diabetic patients raises the question of how
and why it is so safe and effective. Improved glucose tolerance
in rodents suggests the possibility of a phenotype in the �-cell
(8); however, definitive studies had not yet been performed to
assess hepatic and peripheral muscle insulin sensitivity or
whole body energetics. We determined that short-term imeg-
limin treatment modulates glucose-stimulated insulin secretion
in isolated islets and in vivo in rats during a GTT without
altering hepatic or peripheral insulin sensitivity, AMPK activ-

 ity, or energetics. The lack of any difference in hepatic insulin
sensitivity in high-fat-fed rats using the gold-standard tech-
nique, the hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp, shows that
after 2 wk of treatment, imeglimin’s benefit on glucose toler-
ance in this HFD rat model is due to its ability to increase
glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. This result contrasts with
the improvement in insulin sensitivity shown by Vial et al. (12)
in the high-fat, high-sucrose diet mouse model (HFHSD) and

 by Fouqueray et al. (1) in streptozotocin-treated diabetic rats.
These differences could be explained by the difference in
treatment duration (2 wk in the present study vs. 6–7 wk in the
previous studies) and/or by differences in imeglimin effects in
the models. Imeglimin decreased liver lipid content in HFHSD
mice by 30% (12) but had no effect on liver triglycerides in the
present study (data not shown).
Treatment of isolated rodent islets with imeglimin acutely
potentiated insulin secretion, indicating that there is a primary
and direct effect of the compound on intact islets. Similarly,
following the treatment of healthy rodents in vivo for 2 wk
there was noticeable improvement in insulin secretion consis-
tent with a primary islet effect. It is not surprising and perhaps
anticipated that there are also potential secondary benefits
following the improved glucose homeostasis from augmented
insulin secretion. These might include improvements in insulin
sensitivity after a longer treatment (6 wk), as observed in a
high-fat rat model of insulin resistance. It is also possible that
chronic imeglimin treatment may secondarily improve liver
and muscle insulin sensitivity in diabetic rodents and patients
with type 2 diabetes through reversal of glucose toxicity (10).
In isolated islet perifusions from healthy rats, imeglimin
displayed a potent metabolism-dependent stimulation that re-
sembled more the amplifying effect observed with cell surface
receptors (e.g., GLP-1R or GPR40) rather than triggering by
increasing metabolism or directly closing KATP channels (e.g.,
glucokinase activators or sulfonylureas) (5, 6). This pharma-
cological behavior links the enhanced insulin secretion to
metabolic coupling factors. As such, the amplifying effect is
minimal when on the low end of the physiological range. This
may help explain imeglimin’s observed efficacy without caus-
ing hypoglycemia in humans. As glucose levels climb, there is
a progressive increase in secretion, as would be needed to
reestablish homeostasis following a meal. By acting only when
glucose levels are high, the intermittent responsivity prevents
basal hyperinsulinism and potentially allows the �-cell more of
a chance to rest between challenges. These may afford a
long-term advantage of this novel class of oral agents to protect
and/or preserve islet health.
Future studies will be needed to identify the receptor and/or
pathway(s) through which this compound acts. In particular,
given that both anaplerotic and oxidative mitochondrial me-
tabolism are coupled to insulin secretion, it will be important to
determine whether imeglimin’s action is dependent on one
and/or the other (7, 11). Regardless, here we demonstrate that
the primary mechanism of imeglimin appears to be via islet
amplification rather than improving insulin sensitivity in the
high-fat-fed rat.
