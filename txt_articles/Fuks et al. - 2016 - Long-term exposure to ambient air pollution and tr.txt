estimation to analyse associations of traffic-related exposures with incidence of hypertension, controlling for relevant
confounders, and combined the results from individual studies with random-effects meta-analysis.
Among 41 072 participants free of self-reported hypertension at baseline, 6207 (15.1%) incident cases occurred within
5–9 years of follow-up. Incidence of self-reported hypertension was positively associated with PM2.5 (relative risk (RR)
1.22 [95%-confidence interval (CI):1.08; 1.37] per 5 mg/m3) and PM2.5 absorbance (RR 1.13 [95% CI:1.02; 1.24] per
10 � 5m � 1). These estimates decreased slightly upon adjustment for road traffic noise. Road traffic noise was weakly
positively associated with the incidence of self-reported hypertension. Among 10 896 participants at risk, 3549 new
cases of measured hypertension occurred. We found no clear associations with measured hypertension.

Conclusion
Long-term residential exposures to air pollution and noise are associated with increased incidence of self-reported
hypertension.

Introduction
Exposure to outdoor air pollution is related to higher cardiovascular
disease risk.1 It has been suggested that air pollution exposure might
also be linked to hypertension, a major global risk factor for premature
morbidity and mortality, thus possibly mediating part of the deleterious
effect of air pollution on cardiovascular disease. Short-term increases
in air pollution levels can raise blood pressure (BP) rapidly, as reported
in observational and experimental studies.1 In contrast, the evidence
on long-term effects of air pollution on BP or hypertension is scarce
and heterogeneous, with a clear lack of prospective studies. Long-term
exposure to air pollution was associated with an increase in systolic
and/or diastolic BP in a few recent cross-sectional studies.2–7 However,
results were inverse in a study with a large Danish cohort.8 Positive
associations of air pollution with incident9,10 and prevalent4,11 hyper-
tension were reported in some, but not all studies.5,6,8,12 In our recent
cross-sectional meta-analysis of 15 European cohorts we observed a
weak positive association between high residential traffic exposure and
BP in participants not taking BP lowering medication (BPLM), and an
elevated odds ratio for prevalent hypertension. However, there were
no consistent associations of air pollutants and BP.13
Long-term noise exposure shares many sources with outdoor air
pollution and has the potential to confound air pollution estimates.
Positive associations between road traffic noise exposure and hyper-
tension have been reported in a meta-analysis of 27 observational
studies.14 Despite the close relation of ambient noise and air pollu-
tion, few studies so far have taken noise exposure into account when
investigating the effects of air pollution.5,6,8,13,15,10
In the present study, we investigated associations between long-
term exposure to ambient air pollution, traffic indicators, and road traf-
fic noise with the incidence of hypertension in seven European cohorts
participating in the European study of cohorts for Air Pollution Effects
(ESCAPE, http://www.escapeproject.eu; 16 Sept 2016).
Methods
Cohort studies
This analysis was a part of the ESCAPE Project, which investigated the
long term effects of exposure to air pollution on human health in Europe.
We included seven European cohorts from five countries with informa-
tion on hypertension status for at least two time points (e.g. baseline and
follow-up examination) and the most important potential confounders.
The population-based cohorts were: Oslo health study (HUBRO,
Norway); Stockholm diabetes preventive program (SDPP; Sweden); the
Swedish national study of aging and care in Kungsholmen (SNAC-K;
Sweden); the Diet, Cancer, and Health cohort (DCH, Denmark); the
Heinz Nixdorf risk factors, evaluation of coronary calcification, and life-
style study (HNR, Germany); the Cooperative Health Research in the
Region of Augsburg (KORA, Germany); and Registre Giron
�
ı del Cor—
Girona’s heart registry (REGICOR, Spain). These cohorts have been
described previously.13 Work in all cohorts was conducted in accordance
with the Declaration of Helsinki, and with all local ethical requirements.
Exposure assessment
Ambient air pollution concentrations were assessed according to the stand-
ard ESCAPE procedure.16,17 In short, for each area under study, concentra-
tions of PM10, PMcoarse (calculated as PM10 minus PM2.5), PM2.5, and PM2.5
absorbance (blackness of the PM2.5 exposed filter, determined by measure-
ment of light reflectance, as a marker for soot and black carbon), were
measured in 20 sites, and concentrations of nitrogen oxides (NO2, NOx)
were measured in 40 sites in three separate 2-week periods (to cover dif-
ferent seasons) between 2008 and 2011. Adjusted average annual concen-
trations were calculated for each site based on continuous measurements
taken at one background site over a whole year. Using several traffic and
land use variables (e.g. traffic, industry, port activity, residential density),
derived from Europe-wide and local Geographic Information System data-
bases, area-specific land use regression models were developed for each
pollutant and applied to each participant’s residential address.
We obtained the area-specific average daily road traffic noise levels as
the A-weighted day-evening-night indicator (Lden). It was modelled at the
residential fac
¸ades of the participant�
s addresses according to the EU
Directive 2002/49/EC, as described previously.13
In addition to modelled air pollution and noise, we assessed traffic indi-
cators for the home addresses of participants, including (i) total traffic load
on major road fragments (defined as roads with traffic intensities > 5000
vehicles/day) within a 100 m radius around the residence (‘traffic load’);
and (ii) traffic intensity on the nearest road (‘traffic intensity’).
Outcome assessment
We investigated two outcomes in those free of disease at baseline inci-
dent self-reported hypertension and incident measured hypertension.
Self-reported hypertension status was obtained at two time points in all

seven cohorts. Measured hypertension was assessed as either systolic
BP�140 mmHg, diastolic BP�90mmHg, or current intake of BPLM, as
described elsewhere.13 Information on measured hypertension at base-
line and follow-up was available in five cohorts (SNAC-K, SDPP, HNR,
KORA, and REGICOR). Intake of BPLM was additionally analysed as a
separate outcome. We assessed agreement of incident self-reported and
measured hypertension as the number of participants with concordant
hypertension status in the subgroup of those participants who were free
of self-reported and measured hypertension at baseline.
Statistical analyses in cohorts
The analyses were performed in each cohort separately, using a uniform
statistical protocol and centrally developed analysis codes. Cohort-
specific results were pooled with a centrally conducted meta-analysis.
Since the exact time of hypertension diagnosis was not available, we esti-
mated the association between exposures and incident hypertension
with Poisson regression and present the estimates as relative risk (RR).
We used robust variance estimation to avoid variance overestimation, as
Poisson regression is applied to binary data. Exposures were entered in
the analysis as linear predictors. The main adjustment set was defined a
priori and included baseline variables for age, sex, education, economic
activity (full time employed, part time employed, retired, homemaker,
unemployed), body mass index (BMI), smoking status, pack-years of
smoking, passive smoking, total alcohol consumption, wine consumption,
physical activity, family history of hypertension (if available), and area-
level socio-economic status (SES). Two-exposure models with simultane-
ous inclusion of individual air pollutants and noise were conducted to
adjust for mutual confounding. Extensive sensitivity analyses were con-
ducted to examine the robustness of the results towards different model
specifications and outcome definitions (see section ‘Cohort-specific sen-
sitivity analyses’ in Supplemental Material).
Meta-analysis
We performed the random effects meta-analysis of the cohort specific
effect estimates based on the DerSimonian and Laird method.18 Inclusion
of cohorts in the meta-analysis was based on data availability. We defined
a P-value of the Cochran’s Q-test <0.05 or I2 >50% as an indication of
heterogeneity. All analyses were conducted with STATA 10.0–12.0
(StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA) and R 2.13.1 (www.r-project.org;
16 Sept 2016).
Results
The baseline characteristics of the study populations including all par-
ticipants with repeated information on self-reported or measured
hypertension are presented in Table 1. Mean age ranged from 47
years (SDPP) to 71 years (SNAC-K), percentage of men from 38% to
50% and mean systolic BP from 122.8mmHg (SDPP) to 142.3 mmHg
(SNAC-K). The prevalence of self-reported hypertension ranged
from 17.1% (DCH) to 42.8% (HNR). The prevalence of measured
hypertension was lowest in SDPP (24.0%) and highest in SNAC-K
(69.3%). The baseline characteristics of the sub-cohorts without
prevalent hypertension cases, included in the analyses with incident
self-reported or measured hypertension, differed from the respective
complete cohorts: participants were slightly younger, had lower BP
and BMI values, were more highly educated, smoked less and had a

lower prevalence of coronary heart disease (CHD) and type 2 diabetes
mellitus (T2DM; see Supplementary material online, Tables S1 and S2).
We included 41 072 participants from all seven cohorts in the anal-
ysis of incident self-reported hypertension and 10 896 participants
from five cohorts (SNAC-K, SDPP, HNR, KORA, REGICOR) in the
analysis of incident measured hypertension (Table 2). Overall, 6207
(15.1%) incident cases of self-reported hypertension and 3549
(32.6%) incident cases of measured hypertension were identified.
We observed a moderate to almost complete agreement (69.6–
84.5%) of cases with self-reported and measured hypertension in the
different cohorts. 74 to 98.6% of incident cases of self-reported
hypertension were also identified as new cases of BPLM intake (see
Supplementary material online, Table S3).
We found higher average levels of air pollution in the central and
southern European study areas (HNR, KORA, and REGICOR) than
in the Scandinavian study areas (HUBRO, SDPP, SNAC-K, DCH;
Table 3). Traffic and noise exposures were highest in SNAC-K and
REGICOR. The distribution of exposures in the sub-cohorts was sim-
ilar to that in the total study populations at baseline (see
Supplementary material online, Tables S4 and S5).
Air pollutants correlated weakly (Spearman’s q 0.3–0.5) with traffic
indicators, except for SNAC-K and DCH, where moderate correla-
tions up to 0.65 were observed (see Supplementary material online,
Table S6). Air pollutants and traffic indicators correlated weakly to
moderately (Spearman’s q 0.5–0.7) with road traffic noise, except for
REGICOR which had higher correlations (Spearman’s q > 0.7).
Several air pollutants were associated with incidence of self-reported
hypertension (Figure 1). The RR estimates in the meta-analysis of seven
studies were 1.22 [95%-confidence interval (CI): 1.08;1.37] per 5 mg/m3
PM2.5 and 1.13 [1.02;1.24] per 10 � 5m � 1 PM2.5 absorbance (Table 4).
We also found non-significantly elevated point estimates for PM10,
PMcoarse, NO2, NOx, traffic load, and LDEN with incidence of self-
reported hypertension (Table 4, Figure 1, and see Supplementary material
online, Figures S1–S5). The association of PM2.5 with incident self-
reported hypertension was robust to the inclusion of a random intercept
for area, additional covariates, short-term air pollution exposure, and to
the exclusion of participants who changed their address during follow-up
(see Supplementary material online, Figure S6). The association of PM2.5
absorbance was weaker after adjustment for area-level SES, stronger
after adjustment for short-term air pollution, and unchanged with other

model specifications. Observed effect estimates did not change materially
when we restricted the meta-analysis to studies with available data on
measured hypertension, which restricted the analysis to 12 249 partici-
pants (see Supplementary material online, Table S7).
Measured incident hypertension was not related to long-term
exposure to air pollution, traffic indicators, or road traffic noise.
Heterogeneity of effects between studies was only apparent for
PM2.5 absorbance (Table 4 and Figure 1). Similarly to the main analy-
ses, we found no associations when using alternative definitions of
measured hypertension in sensitivity analyses, although a few RRs
were elevated when the 160 mmHg cut-off value was used to define
hypertension (see Supplementary material online, Table S8).
We observed elevated RRs for the associations between the fol-
lowing pollutants and incident intake of BPLM: 1.15 [0.99; 1.34] per 5
mg/m3 of PM2.5, 1.08 [0.96, 1.22] per 10� 5m-L of PM2.5 absorbance,
1.08 [1.01; 1.15] per 4� 106 vehicles� m/day traffic load, and 1.05
[0.99; 1.10] per 10 dB(A) road traffic noise (Table 4).
In two-exposure models, in which an air pollutant and noise expo-
sure were included simultaneously, the estimated RRs for self-
reported hypertension only slightly decreased for the PM pollutants
(e.g. to 1.20 [1.05, 1.37] for PM2.5 and 1.10 [0.98, 1.24] for PM2.5
absorbance; see Supplementary material online, Figure S7). The esti-
mates for nitrogen oxides and traffic indicators remained unchanged.
For measured hypertension, the estimated RRs for PM exposures
increased after adjustment for road traffic noise, while the estimates
for nitrogen oxides and traffic indicators were mostly unchanged.
After adjustment for PM2.5, the estimated RRs for road traffic noise
were unchanged for measured hypertension and closer to null for
self-reported hypertension (see Supplementary material online,
Figure S7).

In a subgroup analysis we observed higher RRs with PM2.5 for
both self-reported and measured hypertension RRs were elevated in
participants with CHD or T2DM, although with high imprecision of
the effect estimate in the groups with the disorder. Further, the self-
reported hypertension RR was higher in more educated participants
(see Supplementary material online, Figure S8).
Discussion
In this multicentre study including seven European cohorts, long-term
residential exposure to PM2.5 air pollution and high traffic load was
positively associated with incident self-reported hypertension and inci-
dent intake of BPLM. These associations did not change substantially
after adjustment for road traffic noise. Road traffic noise itself was
weakly associated with incident self-reported hypertension and intake
of BPLM, but estimates were attenuated after adjustment for PM2.5.
In this large prospective study on environmental exposures and
incident hypertension, we estimated an increase in risk for self-
reported hypertension of 22% per 5 mg/m3 increase in PM2.5. This is
in line with prior findings from Coogan et al.10 in a cohort of 4204
black women living in Los Angeles, but is higher than the finding of
Chen et al.9 in a sample of 35 303 Ontario residents. Our results also
corroborate the positive longitudinal association of high traffic load at
the residence with BPLM intake that we previously observed in our
cross-sectional investigation in 15 ESCAPE cohorts.13 The size of the
effect is similar to that associated with having a high BMI (RR 1.24
(95%-CI: 1.12, 1.36) per standard deviation, as reported in a study
with normotensive adults), thereby underscoring the importance of
the observed association.19
In the present study we observed relevant differences in the
results, with positive associations found for self-reported hyperten-
sion and incident intake of BPLM, but no associations found for meas-
ured hypertension using the standard JNCVII cut-off values.
Outcome misclassification might be a possible explanation as the
overlap of cases of self-reported and measured hypertension varied
substantially across cohorts. We defined measured hypertension as a
combined outcome based on a one-time BP measurement during the
study centre visit and/or a reported intake of BPLM. A one-time
office-based BP measurement in the framework of a cohort study is
subject to large intra-individual variability. This variability, as well as
the potential misclassification of medication as anti-hypertensive, if
indeed the indication was otherwise, might have led to a low specific-
ity of the measured hypertension definition with many false positives.
Supporting this notion of low specificity, we observed elevated RRs
when applying a cut-off value of 160mmHg. In contrast to measured
hypertension, self-reported hypertension or intake of BPLM varies
less and will lead to fewer false positive cases. This can potentially
explain the positive effects for self-reported hypertension and inci-
dent BPLM as well as some of the inconsistencies between prior
studies, some of which have reported positive associations with
hypertension,4,9–11 while others found null effects.5,6,8,12
The effects of PM2.5 air pollution on incident hypertension
remained stable after adjustment for road traffic noise. These findings
are similar to our previous meta-analysis of 15 ESCAPE cohorts, in
which adjustment for road traffic noise did not affect the cross-
sectional associations between air pollution or traffic indicators and
arterial BP.13 Adjustment for noise led to no or only minor changes in
the

However, negative confounding of NOx associations with BP/hyper-
tension by traffic noise was reported in an analysis of the REGICOR
study in Spain.6
In contrast, the positive relationship between road traffic noise
and self-reported hypertension was attenuated after adjustment for
PM2.5 in our study. A small decrease and loss of statistical significance
for the association between noise and BP/hypertension upon adjust-
ment for PM2.5 was reported by Babisch et al.15 in the cross-sectional
analysis of the KORA study. Three other European studies have
shown positive associations between railway and road traffic noise
and hypertension/BP, which were robust to adjustment for ambient
nitrogen oxide concentrations, but no information on adjustment for
particles is given.20–22 Our air pollution-sensitive noise findings should
be interpreted with caution. First, in contrast to ambient air pollution,
noise measured at the fac
¸ade and indoor exposure to traffic-related
noise can vary substantially across and within populations. Window
technology, location of bed rooms relative to streets, hearing impair-
ment and personal behaviour like ventilation habits or the use of ear
plugs can result in misclassification of noise exposure if the assess-
ment is solely based on outdoor fac
¸ade values. Foraster et al.20 found
that associations between air pollution and traffic noise, and preva-
lent hypertension and systolic BP were more consistent and less
affected by mutual adjustment when noise exposure was estimated
as indoor noise levels, taking housing characteristics and coping strat-
egies into account.
The suggested biological mechanisms for the cardiovascular effects
of air pollution include the elicitation of local and systemic inflamma-
tion and oxidative stress, autonomic imbalance, and endothelial dys-
function.1 Road traffic noise, on the other hand, is a stressor affecting
the endocrine system and the autonomic nervous system,15 there-
fore, it is possible that air pollution and noise affect different patho-
physiologic pathways, or at least, not completely overlapping ones.
One of the limitations of our study is that study-specific differences
in outcome assessment might have led to heterogeneity between indi-
vidual studies. Moreover, measured hypertension was not available for
all studies. We could not validate the cases of measured or self-
reported hypertension with physician diagnosis in the individual
cohorts. The number of participants in the analysis with measured
hypertension was about 10 000 participants, which is four times smaller
than in the analysis with self-reported hypertension, and it is possible
that we did not have sufficient power to detect an association with
measured hypertension given the high variance of BP measurements.
Selection bias due to a healthy survivor effect should be considered, as
we used follow-up data covering 9 years, and possible losses to follow-
up could have included those with incident hypertension. The expo-
sure assessment was conducted in 2008–2011, while cohorts were
incepted in 1992–2003. We assume, however, that spatial contrasts
were stable over time, as has been shown previously.23
Our study has a number of strengths. It is one of the first and up to
now the largest study, to investigate prospectively the mutual effect
of air pollution and road traffic noise on incidence of hypertension,
simultaneously. The large multicentre study, with well characterized
prospective cohorts, identical protocols for exposure assessment,
outcome definition, and statistical analysis, enabled a high degree of
harmonization. We used diverse populations with different baseline
risks for hypertension, allowing us to extrapolate the results of our
study more widely than most single centre studies can. We were able
to investigate incidence of hypertension, using alternative definitions
of hypertension and to compare the results.
In conclusion, our results show that long-term exposure to PM2.5
air pollution and high traffic load are positively associated with inci-
dent self-reported hypertension and incident BPLM intake, respec-
tively, and that these associations are not confounded by road traffic
noise. We also found supporting evidence that outdoor road traffic
noise is associated with self-reported hypertension and intake of
BPLM. Given the ubiquitous presence of air pollution, these results, if
confirmed, have important public health consequences and call for
more stringent air quality regulations.
