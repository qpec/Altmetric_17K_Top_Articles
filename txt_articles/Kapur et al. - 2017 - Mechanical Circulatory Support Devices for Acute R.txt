ABSTRACT: Right ventricular (RV) failure remains a major cause of 
global morbidity and mortality for patients with advanced heart failure, 
pulmonary hypertension, or acute myocardial infarction and after major 
cardiac surgery. Over the past 2 decades, percutaneously delivered acute 
mechanical circulatory support pumps specifically designed to support RV 
failure have been introduced into clinical practice. RV acute mechanical 
circulatory support now represents an important step in the management 
of RV failure and provides an opportunity to rapidly stabilize patients with 
cardiogenic shock involving the RV. As experience with RV devices grows, 
their role as mechanical therapies for RV failure will depend less on the 
technical ability to place the device and more on improved algorithms for 
identifying RV failure, patient monitoring, and weaning protocols for both 
isolated RV failure and biventricular failure. In this review, we discuss the 
pathophysiology of acute RV failure and both the mechanism of action 
and clinical data exploring the utility of existing RV acute mechanical 
circulatory support devices.
R
ight ventricular (RV) failure increases short-term mortality.1–11 This obser-
vation has been confirmed in the setting of acute myocardial infarction, 
cardiogenic shock, advanced left-sided heart failure, and pulmonary hyper-
tension. Four primary mechanisms underlie the development of acute RV failure: 
contractile failure secondary to myocardial ischemia or inflammation caused by 
myocarditis, volume overload as a result of right-sided valvular insufficiency, vol-
ume overload caused by increased venous return or displacement of the interven-
tricular septum toward the left ventricle (LV) after placement of an LV assist device 
(LVAD),12–15 and pressure overload resulting from decompensated left-sided heart 
failure, worsening pulmonary hypertension, or acute pulmonary embolus. Despite 
growing awareness of the importance of acute RV failure, mechanical circulatory 
support (MCS) devices remain the only therapy that specifically targets RV failure. 
In this review, we discuss the pathophysiology of acute RV failure and both the 
mechanism of action and clinical data exploring the utility of existing RV acute 
MCS (AMCS) devices.
PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF ACUTE RV FAILURE
The majority of RV stroke work maintains forward momentum of blood flow into 
a highly compliant, low-resistance pulmonic circulation. For this reason, the RV is 
characterized by low peak systolic pressure and the absence of isovolumic phases 
of contraction and relaxation during systole and diastole, and it generates one

sixth the stroke work compared with the LV.16–18 When 
RV contractile function is severely impaired, as in the 
case of RV infarction, the RV manifests reduced peak 
systolic pressure, increased end-diastolic volume, and 
reduced stroke volume. Afterload is another major de-
terminant of RV function.18–25 On a cellular basis, af-
terload is quantified by changing ventricular wall stress 
throughout systole. In diseased states such as heart 
failure, pulmonary hypertension, or acute pulmonary 
embolism, a rise in RV afterload increases RV pressures 
and volumes and reduces RV stroke volume.
Determinants of RV afterload include pulmonary 
vascular resistance, compliance, and, more generally, 
pulmonary impedance. Impedance results when ante-
grade flow through the pulmonary artery (PA) gener-
ates a backward wave reflection driven by the multiple 
branch points throughout the pulmonary vasculature. 
This backward flow wave collides with the antegrade 
wave, which increases pulmonary pressure and reduces 
pulmonary blood flow. These wave reflections consti-
tute what is known as pulsatile load.22,23 PA and pulmo-
nary venous hypertension can increase the magnitude 
of the pulsatile load, thereby increasing afterload on 
the RV. In the acute setting, increased pulsatile load de-
creases RV stroke volume. Recent studies have identi-
fied that increased LV filling pressures (also reflected as 
increases in pulmonary capillary pressure) also reduce 
PA compliance, increase PA resistance, and increase PA 
impedance, thereby further increasing RV afterload.22–25 
Thus, LV filling pressure is a major determinant of all 3 
components of RV afterload. For this reason, LV failure 
is a common cause of RV failure.
RV FAILURE: A HEMODYNAMIC 
PROBLEM
Acute RV failure is a hydraulic problem caused by im-
paired function of the pump, the valves, or the con-
duits. Diagnosing acute RV failure remains a major clini-
cal challenge. Physical examination, echocardiographic, 
and laboratory findings associated with RV failure have 
been reviewed previously.4,26–29 Invasive hemodynam-
ic measures can be obtained with a PA catheter and 
are predictive of RV failure (Table 1). The simplest ap-
proach to quantify RV dysfunction is to measure the 
ratio of right atrial (RA) to pulmonary capillary wedge 
pressures. In the setting of acute myocardial infarction, 
Lopez-Sendon and colleagues30 identified that a ratio 
of RA pressure to pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 
>0.86 was associated with pathological evidence of RV 
infarction at necropsy. Several subsequent studies have 
demonstrated the utility of the ratio of RA pressure to 
pulmonary capillary wedge pressure as an index of bi-
ventricular congestion and the relative contribution of 
LV or RV failure among patients with acute myocardial 
infarction and advanced heart failure and as a predictor 
of RV failure after LVAD implantation.13,30,38,39 RV stroke 
work is another important measure of RV function; 
however, calculation of RV stroke work requires a true 
estimate of cardiac output, which is commonly mea-
sured with the Fick method in RV failure. The method 
of thermodilution may underestimate cardiac output as 
a result of tricuspid regurgitation.38,40
Multiple formulas to assess pulmonary hemodynam-
ics have been developed to quantify RV afterload, in-
cluding pulmonary vascular resistance, transpulmonary 
gradient, diastolic pulmonary gradient, PA elastance, 
PA compliance, and PA impedance.15,33,34,36,37,41 Howev-
er, none of these formulas in isolation definitively iden-
tifies RV failure. In 2012, we first reported the clinical 
utility of the PA pulsatility index (PAPi) as a measure 
of RV failure in the setting of acute MI.32 The PAPi is 
the ratio of PA pulse pressure divided by RA pressure. 
PA pulse pressure provides an estimate of RV pulsatile 
load and contractile strength. By normalizing PA pulse 
pressure to RA pressure, the PAPi incorporates RV con-
gestion as another indicator of RV failure. In this first 
study, we identified that a PAPi <1.0 was a highly sen-
sitive indicator of RV failure in the setting of an acute 
myocardial infarction. Next, we explored the utility of 
the PAPi as a marker of RV failure after implantation 
of a continuous-flow LVAD. In this study, we identi-
fied that a PAPi <1.85 was a sensitive predictor of RV 
failure after LVAD implantation.31 Several studies have 
since confirmed the utility of the PAPi as a marker of

RV failure in various settings.42 The PAPi has not been 
studied in the setting of PA hypertension but may be 
of limited value in this setting because of compensa-
tory RV remodeling that allows relatively high PA pulse 
pressures despite worsening RV function. Further stud-
ies exploring the clinical utility of the PAPi as a marker 
of RV failure are required.
MEDICAL MANAGEMENT  
OF RV FAILURE
Medical management of acute RV failure has been 
extensively reviewed previously and begins with 
treatment of any reversible cause, which commonly 
includes coronary revascularization for an acute cor-
onary syndrome or thrombolytic therapy for a pul-
monary embolism.4,18 Medical therapy can be divided 
into 3 major interventions. First, optimization of RV 
preload with either diuretic therapy or volume expan-
sion is required to maintain cardiac output without 
worsening venous congestion. For this reason, inva-
sive hemodynamic monitoring with a PA catheter may 
be useful for patients with RV failure and cardiogenic 
shock. Second, reducing RV afterload with pulmo-
nary vasodilators may improve RV cardiac output.43–45 
Third, for patients with persistent hemodynamic in-
stability despite optimization of RV loading condi-
tions, inotropic therapy with either a phosphodiester-
ase inhibitor or β1-adrenergic receptor agonist may 
further improve total cardiac output.46 For acute RV 
failure that is refractory to medical therapy, invasive 
therapeutic options include atrial septostomy, atrial 
pacing in the setting of bradycardia, durable MCS, 
and AMCS devices.
MCS FOR RV FAILURE
Historically, surgically implanted pumps to support RV 
failure were pulsatile with valves located within the in-
flow and outflow cannulas. One of the earliest acute 
RV support devices was a PA balloon counterpulsation 
pump, which was limited by the need for surgical im-
plantation and variable effects on RV afterload.47,48 In 
the early 1990s, rotary-flow RV assist devices (RVADs) 
demonstrated hemodynamic superiority and better 
clinical outcomes compared with PA balloon counter-
pulsation pump for acute RV failure.49 Second- and 
third-generation surgical pumps used as RVADs now 
include roto-dynamic pumps that transfer rotational ki-
netic energy to the circulation.
Preload and afterload are major determinants 
of flow through all rotary-flow MCS devices.50 De-
vice flow (Q) is directly related to rotations per min-
ute of the impeller and indirectly related to pressure 
gradient between the inlet (preload) and outlet (af-
terload) of the impeller. This pressure gradient (ie, 
afterload−preload), referred to as the pressure head 
(H), varies during the cardiac cycle (Figure 1). For LVADs 
that draw blood from the LV and pump it to the aorta, 
H is lowest during ventricular systole when LV pressure 
is greatest; conversely, H is highest during ventricular 
diastole when LV pressure is at its lowest value. Ac-
cordingly, because flow is inversely related to H, LVAD 
pump flow is maximum during systole and minimum 
during diastole. These dynamics are readily appreci-
ated from the rotations per minute–dependent H-Q 
curve of a pump. For RV support devices that draw 
blood from the RA and pump to the PA, the dynamics 
are fundamentally the same, but because variations 
in RA and PA pressures are not as great as in the LV, 
variations in RVAD flow are generally significantly less 
than for LVADs.51
In the case of RV failure, most MCS systems will in-
clude cannulation of the RA and PA to deliver flow into 
and out of a continuous-flow pump, respectively. H in 
this case is determined by RA pressure (preload) and PA 
pressure (afterload). For patients with severe RV failure 
resulting from acute ischemia or impaired contractility, 
the difference between RA and PA pressure is often 
small, and therefore, for fixed rotations per minute, 
device flow will be high. For patients with RV failure 
caused by severe pulmonary hypertension, the differ-
ence between RA and PA pressure may be large, and 
for the same rotations per minute setting, device flow 
will be low.
Figure 1. The H-Q curve: a fundamental principle of con-
tinuous-flow pumps for right ventricular (RV) support.  
Primary determinants of device flow (Q) for rotary pumps 
include rotations per minute (RPM) and the pressure gradient 
between the inlet and outlet of the impeller referred to as 
the pressure head (H). In the case of RV acute mechanical 
circulatory support devices, H is determined by pulmonary 
artery (PA) pressure (Pout) and right atrial (RA) pressure (Pin). 
In the setting of pulmonary hypertension, H may be high, 
which reduces device flow. In the setting of acute severe RV 
failure, H may be low, which increases device flow.

DURABLE MCS OPTIONS FOR RV 
FAILURE
In the contemporary era, surgical RVADs continue to 
use extracorporeal centrifugal-flow pumps such as 
the CentriMag pump (St. Jude, Minneapolis, MN) and 
RA-to-PA cannulation with either a thoracotomy or an 
open sternotomy. Given that large-bore, short cannulas 
may be used for surgical cannulation, flows achieved 
with this approach can range up to 6 to 8 L/min. For 
more durable, long-term support, isolated pulsatile 
RVADs, surgically deployed rotary-flow RVADs, and bi-
ventricular support with pulsatile VADs or total artifi-
cial heart replacement are potential options; however, 
the majority of these patients are required to remain in 
the hospital under close surveillance. For this reason, 
surgeons have begun to use commercially available 
LVADs, including the Jarvik and HeartWare devices, in 
the RV position to support isolated RV or biventricular 
failure.51–56 A major limitation of this approach is that 
the operating H-Q curve for a surgical LVAD is better 
suited for the systemic circulation with higher pressure 
and resistance. Furthermore, because the RV tends to 
operate in a lower-pressure, less resistant, and more 
compliant system, surgical LVADs connected to the 
RA and PA may be more prone to suction events. To 
overcome this limitation, operators have placed gap 
spacers to reduce protrusion of the LVAD inlet can-
nula into the RV and restricted the outflow graft of an 
LVAD by up to 50%, thereby increasing resistance to 
VAD outflow to a level that approximates the systemic 
circulation.51–56
Several surgically implanted devices for more 
durable RV support are emerging. The HeartWare 
MVAD is an axial-flow pump that has a unique out-
flow port that originates at a 90° angle from the im-
peller, thereby functioning in part like a centrifugal-
flow pump. The miniature size of the MVAD makes it 
potentially suitable for RV and biventricular support, 
which has been tested in preclinical models.57 The 
MVAD is not approved for clinical use in the United 
States. The Circulite Synergy device is another min-
iaturized hybrid axial-centrifugal–flow pump that has 
been evaluated in preclinical models for RV and biven-
tricular support.58–61
AMCS (PERCUTANEOUS) OPTIONS 
FOR RV FAILURE
Percutaneously delivered AMCS devices for RV failure 
(RV-AMCS) are relatively new and provide the oppor-
tunity for early intervention in RV failure without the 
need for surgery. RV-AMCS device options include 
venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation 
(VA-ECMO), the TandemHeart centrifugal-flow pump 
(TandemLife, Pittsburgh, PA), and the axial-flow Im-
pella RP catheter (Abiomed Inc, Danvers, MA). These 
devices can be categorized according to their mecha-
nism of action as either direct RV bypass or indirect 
RV bypass systems (Figure 2). The Impella RP and the 
TandemHeart RVAD (TH-RVAD) displace blood from 
the RA to PA, thereby directly bypassing the RV. In 
contrast, VA-ECMO displaces and oxygenates blood 
from the RA to the femoral artery, thereby indirectly 
bypassing the RV. As a result, these systems have dis-
tinct hemodynamic effects, depending on whether the 
patient has isolated RV failure or biventricular failure 
(Table 2).
For patients with isolated RV failure, activation of ei-
ther an Impella RP or a TH-RVAD will directly reduce RA 
pressure, increase mean PA pressure, and increase LV 
preload. In the presence of preserved LV function, na-
tive cardiac output will increase and LV filling pressures 
will increase or remain unchanged. LV afterload will re-
main unchanged. In contrast, VA-ECMO will decrease 
RA and PA pressure initially and decrease LV preload. 
LV afterload will increase greatly, and therefore, in the 
presence of preserved LV function, native cardiac out-
put may remain unchanged or decrease.
For patients with biventricular failure, activation of 
either an Impella RP or a TH-RVAD will directly reduce 
RA pressure, increase mean PA pressure, and increase 
LV preload. In the absence of preserved LV function 
and without an additional LV support device, native 
cardiac output will remain unchanged or increase 
slightly. However, cardiac filling pressures could in-
crease significantly, leading to pulmonary edema. LV 
afterload would increase. In contrast, VA-ECMO will 
decrease RA pressure and initially decrease PA pres-
sure and LV preload. However, with poor LV function, 
increased LV afterload will reduce native cardiac out-

rect RV bypass, as well as intracorporeal

put and increase LV filling pressures, thereby leading 
to pulmonary edema and a subsequent increase in 
mean PA pressure.
If biventricular mechanical support is initiated for bi-
ventricular failure, right-sided support will reduce RA 
pressure and increase PA pressure, thereby providing 
preload to the LV. With a concomitant left-sided sup-
port device in place, native cardiac output will decrease, 
and as a result, LV filling pressures will decrease or re-
main unchanged. Similarly, LV afterload will increase or 
remain unchanged. Because of these effects, identify-
ing biventricular failure is important when considering 
RV-AMCS.
Intra-Aortic Balloon Pump
Intra-aortic counterpulsation balloon pumps (IABPs) 
are commonly used to support RV failure but are not 
optimally suited for this purpose. IABPs inflate during 
diastole, which causes increased retrograde flow into 
the aortic root and increases mean arterial pressure, 
thus potentially increasing coronary perfusion. During 
systole, the IABP deflates and produces a pressure sink, 
which then becomes filled by ejected blood from the 
LV. As a result, IABP therapy reduces LV afterload and 
increases mean arterial pressure. IABP therapy does not 
directly support RV function and theoretically may do so 
only by reducing LV filling pressures, thereby reducing 
RV afterload, which in isolation may not significantly 
improve cardiac function for medically refractory acute 
RV failure. Clinical data evaluating the use of IABPs in 
RV failure are limited. Several recent studies have re-
ported limited efficacy of IABP therapy in patients with 
RV failure.62,63 In these studies, IABPs failed to augment 
cardiac output in patients with advanced heart failure 
who had either reduced RV cardiac power output or 
echocardiographic and hemodynamic signs of RV fail-
ure. For these, reasons, IABPs are not considered pri-
mary RV-AMCS devices.
Impella RP: A Direct RV Bypass System
The most recent introduction to the field of RV-AMCS 
devices is the Impella RP (Abiomed Inc) microaxial-
flow catheter. The Impella RP uses a 22F impeller 
mounted onto an 11F catheter and delivers blood 
from the RA into the PA (Figures 3 and 4A). The de-
vice is delivered via a 23F venous peel-away sheath 
into the PA with a 0.018-in wire used as a monorail 
system and requires 1 venous access site (most com-
monly the right femoral vein). Once in position, the 
23F sheath is replaced with a staged 11F to 23F repo-
sitioning sheath. After removal, the venous access site 
is closed with manual compression and a purse-string 
or deep mattress suture. The Impella RP cannot be used 
to oxygenate blood.
Since 2013, several reports have described success-
ful use of the Impella RP
, initially outside the United 
States, for RV failure in the setting of cardiac surgery 
and after LVAD placement64 (Table 3). In 2015, the RE-
COVER RIGHT trial prospectively studied the utility of 
the Impella RP device for medically refractory RV failure 
in 12 patients with acute myocardial infarction and 18 
patients after cardiac surgery.65 Immediately after Im-
pella RP activation, central venous pressure and cardiac 
index improved, allowing weaning of inotrope and va-
sopressor support. The most common adverse events 
were bleeding and hemolysis. No thromboembolic 
events were observed, and worsened tricuspid or pul-
monary valve dysfunction was infrequent. The primary

end point of survival to 30 days or hospital discharge of 
73% compares favorably to a prior prospective study of 
a surgical RVAD in a similar patient population.66 The 
Impella RP has been used to support patients with RV 
failure associated with malignant ventricular arrhyth-
mias and severe mitral regurgitation.67–69
The TH-RVAD and Protek Duo Cannula:  
Direct RV Bypass Systems
The TH-RVAD uses an extracorporeal centrifugal-flow 
pump and 2 venous cannulas to deliver blood from the 
RA to the main PA. One 21F inflow cannula is placed in 
the RA, and a second 21F outflow cannula is inserted 
into the main PA. Most TH-RVAD cannulas are deployed 
via both femoral veins. For bilateral femoral cannula-
tion, the outflow cannula is placed in the main PA via 
the right femoral vein, and the inflow cannula is placed 
in the RA via the left femoral vein. In patients with long 
torsos (distance from the femoral vein to the fifth inter-
costal space exceeds 58 cm), the outflow cannula can 
be placed in the main PA via the right internal jugu-
lar vein. This approach can also be used if limitations 
to femoral venous access exist, including infection, 
thrombosis, or inferior vena caval filters.70 When right 
internal jugular access is used, the outflow cannula is 
situated into the main PA via the right internal jugular, 
and the RA inflow cannula is positioned via a femoral 
vein (Figure 3). Use of the right internal jugular led to 
development of the Protek Duo dual-lumen cannula, 
which contains 2 lumens within one 29F or 31F cannula 
(Figure 2).71,72 One lumen serves as an inflow cannula

and encompasses a series of inflow vents positioned 
across the superior vena cava into the RA. The second 
lumen has a multifenestrated distal tip to deliver blood 
into the main PA. The inflow cannula drains blood from 
the RA into an extracorporeal centrifugal pump, which 
delivers blood back to the PA.
Any centrifugal pump with cannulas positioned in 
the RA and PA can be used to provide both RV support 
and improved systemic oxygenation by splicing an oxy-
genator into the circuit. This configuration is referred to 
as an oxy-RVAD.73,74 In contrast, veno-veno ECMO does 
not provide RV support because blood is drained from

the superior or inferior vena cava and delivered back 
to the RA. Direct RV bypass requires positioning of the 
outflow cannula in the PA.
Use of the TH-RVAD has been reported in multiple 
scenarios, including acute myocardial infarction,75–77 
post-LVAD implantation,78 severe pulmonary hyper-
tension,79 severe acute mitral regurgitation,80 and car-
diac rejection after orthotopic heart transplantation.81 
Several case reports have recently described use of 
the Protek Duo cannula for RV failure in the setting 
of LVAD implantation and cardiogenic shock result-
ing from decompensated severe pulmonary hyperten-
sion.71,72 In 2011, a single-center experience reported 
improvements in mean arterial pressure, RA pressure, 
cardiac index, RV stroke work, and mixed venous 
oxygen saturation in 9 patients within 24 hours of 
TH-RVAD implantation for various causes82 (Table 3). 
The in-hospital mortality rate was 44% and highest 
among patients with delayed TH-RVAD placement. 
In this report, no mechanical complications were ob-
served during or after device implantation. In 2014, 
the THRIVE study (TandemHeart in Right Ventricular 
Support) retrospectively studied 46 patients receiving 
a TH-RVAD in 8 tertiary referral centers.84 The TH-
RVAD was associated with acute hemodynamic im-
provement. In-hospital mortality was 57%, with the 
lowest mortality in patients with RV failure secondary 
to acute myocardial infarction or post-LVAD implan-
tation. Increased age, biventricular failure, and TIMI 
(Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction) major bleeding 
were more prevalent in patients who did not survive to 
hospital discharge.
VA-ECMO: An Indirect RV Bypass  
System
VA-ECMO is frequently implanted during cardiopul-
monary collapse or biventricular failure to improve sys-
temic oxygenation. VA-ECMO can be deployed percu-
taneously via an extracorporeal centrifugal pump (ie, 
TandemHeart, CentriMag, Rotaflow, or Biomedicus 
pumps) and displaces venous blood from the RA across 
an oxygenator and into the arterial circulation.86,87 In 
select cases, 2 venous inflow cannulas can be placed 
in the RA and PA, thereby draining the RV from 2 loca-
tions. This configuration is known as veno-veno-arteri-
al ECMO. In the setting of acute RV failure, VA-ECMO 
or veno-veno-arterial ECMO reduces RV preload and 
RV cardiac output. However, by displacing blood from 
the venous to the arterial system, VA-ECMO or veno-
veno-arterial ECMO increases systemic mean arterial 
pressure and LV afterload (Figures 4B and 5). If LV func-
tion is impaired, this rise in LV afterload may increase 
LA and PA pressures, thereby causing progressive acute 
lung injury and worse clinical outcomes.86–88 For this 
reason, if LV function is impaired, VA-ECMO often re-
quires a second device to decompress the LV such as 
an IABP, Impella LV device, or a cannula placed in the 
LA or LV.89–92
Clinical data supporting the use of VA-ECMO in the 
setting of acute RV failure are limited to case reports 
and small case series,93–95 but the effect of VA-ECMO 
on right-sided heart hemodynamics remains largely un-
defined (Table 3). In a study of 179 patients with refrac-
tory cardiogenic shock most commonly resulting from 
acute myocardial infarction or postcardiotomy shock, 
mean central venous pressure decreased by 5 mm 
Hg 
and mean PA pressure decreased by 11 mm 
Hg after 
24 hours of ECMO support.85 These results imply that 
VA-ECMO may have salutary hemodynamic effects in 
patients with RV failure. Further studies exploring the 
effect of VA-ECMO on RV function and the potential 
utility of VA-ECMO as a management option for RV fail-
ure are needed.

Acute Biventricular Circulatory Support
With the advent of RV-AMCS devices, mechanical 
support options for cardiogenic shock caused by bi-
ventricular failure have evolved beyond surgically im-
planted biventricular pumps to now include various 
combinations of percutaneously delivered centrifu-
gal- and axial-flow pumps. Biventricular support can 
be achieved with 2 TandemHeart devices, which re-
quire 4 separate 21F cannulas: 2 for LV support and 
2 for RV support. Several reports have described the 
use of an IABP plus TH-RVAD,96 Impella 2.5 plus TH-
RVAD,97 Impella 5.0 plus TH-RVAD,98 Impella 5.0 plus 
Impella RP,99 and Impella CP plus RP100 for biventricular 
support (Figure 6). As awareness of concomitant RV 
involvement in cardiogenic shock grows, the use of 
biventricular support strategies to improve clinical out-
comes will require further study.
Patient Selection and Management of RV-Specific 
AMCS Devices
Given the recent introduction of RV-AMCS device op-
tions, no specific guidelines to optimize device selec-
tion and management exist. On the basis of the ex-
isting literature and our clinical experience, we have 
provided a few key recommendations and a proposed 
algorithm for the use of RV-AMCS devices (Figure 7). 
Early diagnosis with the use of hemodynamic, echo-
cardiographic, and laboratory parameters to identify 
RV failure, to assess LV function, and to rule out peri-
cardial diseases, including causes of constrictive or 
restrictive physiology, is a critical first step. Next, ini-
tial treatment should focus on reversible causes of RV 
failure such as RV myocardial infarction or pulmonary 
embolus. If not done already, acquiring hemodynamic 
data with a PA catheter will confirm the diagnosis of 
RV failure and provide a real-time assessment of car-
diac function and volume status during treatment, 
which should focus on optimizing cardiac preload, 
considering inotropic support, and reducing RV after-
load by adding pulmonary vasodilators and optimizing 
mechanical ventilator settings.
For patients whose blood pressure or cardiac index 
fails to improve despite initial treatment with an ino-
trope or a vasopressor, early use of RV-AMCS should 
be considered. Hemodynamic indexes (Table 1) may be 
helpful when trying to determine whether RV-AMCS is 
needed. Before RV-AMCS device activation, LV function 
must be carefully assessed. Operators should also clear-
ly define their “exit strategy” and treatment objectives 
before AMCS device use, which may include RV support 
as a bridge to recovery, a bridge to LVAD, biventricular 
VAD, a total artificial heart, or a bridge to orthotopic 
heart transplantation. In the setting of RV myocardial 
infarction, the decision may be fairly straightforward. 
However, in patients with advanced heart failure, a 
heart team–based approach should be used to define 
whether RV-AMCS devices should be used. The need 
for an oxygenator should be anticipated because that 
can influence device selection. After the initiation of RV-
AMCS, hemodynamic monitoring remains an important 
component of the management strategy by providing 
measurements of biventricular filling pressures, PA pul-
satility, and Fick-derived cardiac output as indicators of 
optimal RV-AMCS device function and RV recovery. In 
the setting of impaired LV function, isolated use of an 
RV support device can lead to LV volume overload and 
acute pulmonary injury. Conversely, if isolated LV sup-
port is initiated in the setting of biventricular failure, 
then LV suction may occur as a result of limited preload 
supplied by the failing RV. In these cases, biventricular 
support should be considered. As is the case with most 
support devices, hemodynamic stability and adequate 
systemic perfusion at a low device setting often indicate 
that device removal is feasible.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
Present-day RV-AMCS devices are restricted by the 
need for large-bore cannulas inserted via the femoral 
or internal jugular veins. Mobility for patients requir-
ing RV-AMCS is limited. Future directions for RV-AMCS 
include the development of ambulatory and potentially 
fully implantable systems. The Circulite device (Heart-
Ware Inc) is a fully implantable hybrid axial-centrifugal–
flow pump that can shuttle blood from the RA to PA. 
Early testing of the Circulite system for RV failure in the 
setting of pulmonary hypertension is underway. In ad-
dition to engineering advances, the role of RV-AMCS 
devices as mechanisms to improve hepatic and renal 
congestion remains largely unexplored. Because multi-
organ failure is a major reason for mortality in the set-
ting of RV failure, RV-AMCS devices may serve not only 
to unload the RV but also to decongest and improve 
vital organ function.
SUMMARY
RV failure remains a major cause of morbidity and mor-
tality. Percutaneous RV support devices play an impor-
tant role in the management of RV failure with the abil-
ity to rapidly stabilize patients with cardiogenic shock 
involving the RV. The role of RV-AMCS devices will be 
as a bridge to therapy or recovery while advancements 
in coronary intervention, pulmonary hypertension, car-
diac surgery, transplantation medicine, and VAD tech-
nology offer options for patients who survive cardio-
genic shock. As RV devices become more commonly 
used, their role in the management of RV failure will 
be less dependent on operator skill and more depen-
dent on improved algorithms for the early detection 
of RV failure, device selection, patient monitoring, and 
weaning protocols for both isolated RV failure and bi-
ventricular failure.
