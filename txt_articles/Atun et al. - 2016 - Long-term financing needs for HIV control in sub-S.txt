ABSTRACT
Objectives: To estimate the present value of current
and future funding needed for HIV treatment and
prevention in 9 sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries
that account for 70% of HIV burden in Africa under
different scenarios of intervention scale-up. To analyse
the gaps between current expenditures and funding
obligation, and discuss the policy implications of future
financing needs.
Design: We used the Goals module from Spectrum,
and applied the most up-to-date cost and coverage
data to provide a range of estimates for future
financing obligations. The four different scale-up
scenarios vary by treatment initiation threshold and
service coverage level. We compared the model
projections to current domestic and international
financial sources available in selected SSA countries.
Results: In the 9 SSA countries, the estimated
resources required for HIV prevention and treatment in
2015–2050 range from US$98 billion to maintain
current coverage levels for treatment and prevention
with eligibility for treatment initiation at CD4 count of
<500/mm3 to US$261 billion if treatment were to be
extended to all HIV-positive individuals and prevention
scaled up. With the addition of new funding obligations
for HIV—which arise implicitly through commitment to
achieve higher than current treatment coverage levels
—overall financial obligations (sum of debt levels and
the present value of the stock of future HIV funding
obligations) would rise substantially.
Conclusions: Investing upfront in scale-up of HIV
services to achieve high coverage levels will reduce HIV
incidence, prevention and future treatment expenditures
by realising long-term preventive effects of ART to
reduce HIV transmission. Future obligations are too
substantial for most SSA countries to be met from
domestic sources alone. New sources of funding, in
addition to domestic sources, include innovative
financing. Debt sustainability for sustained HIV
response is an urgent imperative for affected countries
and donors.
INTRODUCTION
Few would doubt the progress achieved in
global health since 2000. The annualised rate
of decline for under-five mortality per 1000
live births accelerated from 1.9 in 1990–2000
to 2.6 in 2000–2011.1 In 1990–2000, age-
standardised
HIV
incidence
per
100 000
population rose, on average, at an annualised
rate of 1.3, and that from mortality by 13.6.
But in 2000–2013, after a peak in 2005, the
HIV incidence and mortality declined by an
annualised average of 3.92 and 1.54 per
100 000 population, respectively.2
Despite the progress, the HIV/AIDS epi-
demic remains a major global threat, requir-
ing sustained investments in health systems
and disease control.3–5 In 1990, an esti-
mated 8.5 million people were living with
Strengths and limitations of this study
▪ The study uses most up-to-date cost, cost-
effectiveness, coverage and epidemiological data
to estimate funding needed for HIV treatment
and prevention in nine sub-Saharan African
countries that account for 70% of HIV burden in
Africa.
▪ The study uses rigorous modelling to estimate
the present value of current and future funding
needs in nine sub-Saharan African countries
under different scenarios of intervention scale-up
between 2015 and 2050.
▪ The estimates extending for the first time from
2015 to 2050 suggest future obligations ranging
from US$98 billion to maintain current coverage
levels for treatment and prevention with eligibility
for treatment initiation at CD4 count of <500/
mm3 to US$261 billion if treatment were to be
extended to all HIV-positive individuals and pre-
vention scaled up.
▪ The study quantifies the significant shortfall
between financing obligations and future funding
available from all sources for countries with high
HIV burden to show that none of these countries
can meet future obligations.
▪ Projected estimates of financing obligations are
limited by inherent uncertainties with modelling
regarding future costs and availability of future
interventions for HIV.

 HIV/AIDS, 1.9 million children and adults were infected
with HIV, and 350 000 succumbed to AIDS-related
deaths.6
In 2002, just 300 000 people in low-income and
middle-income countries (LMIC) were receiving ART.7
By 2015, this number had risen to nearly 16 million.8
New infections and increased longevity of HIV-infected
persons receiving antiretroviral treatment (ART) meant
that by 2014, the number of people living with HIV/
AIDS had risen to 37 million. Yet, in sub-Saharan
Africa (SSA), where 70% of the global total of 37
million HIV-infected people lives, less than half the
persons needing ART receive it, and key prevention
interventions have not reached UNAIDS targets,9 in
spite of the evidence on the health and economic ben-
efits of HIV prevention and ART.9–12
ART prevents onward transmission of HIV.13 14 While
some have suggested that scaling up ART might place
constraints on health systems in the short run, others
have shown that increasing ART uptake reduces hospital-
isation from AIDS, and lessens utilisation of other
healthcare services for treated patients in the long run,
releasing

other
ill-
nesses.15–18
Many countries in the world are committed to ensur-
ing access to
HIV
treatment
for
those
individuals
needing
treatment.19
Long-term
ART
has
a
cost,
however,
and
creates
financing
obligations,
which
HIV-affected countries need to meet from domestic and
external sources of financing. Earlier studies have con-
sidered long-term costs and expenditures, as well as
health and economic benefits of HIV prevention and
treatment.11 12 Other studies have argued that long-term
commitment for HIV prevention and treatment create a
‘fiscal liability’ for governments in countries which have
high prevalence of HIV.20
In this study, we estimate the present value of future
funding needed for HIV response in nine SSA countries
with the highest burden of HIV, defined by the total
number of people living with HIV, which have the most
complete data, and represent the dominant types of
HIV
epidemics
in
SSA:
South
Africa,
Zimbabwe,
Zambia,
Malawi
(high
prevalence
>10%),
Kenya,
Uganda,
Tanzania
(5–10%),
Nigeria
and
Ethiopia
(<5%) (table 1). In total, these nine countries account
for 75% of the total number of people living with HIV
in SSA. We estimate future costs of HIV treatment and
prevention at different levels of scale-up, analyse the
gaps between current and future funding, and discuss
the policy implications of future financing needs.
METHODS
We use the Goals, AIM and DemProj modules from
Spectrum,21 a publicly available modelling tool devel-
oped by international collaborators and currently used
by UNAIDS. We apply, in our modelling, the most
up-to-date cost and coverage data to provide a range of
estimates for future financing obligations. While other
HIV models, such as STDSIM which uses microsimula-
tion,22
and
analytical
models,
such
as
BBH23
co-developed by authors involved in this study, we
choose Spectrum for the study to ensure easy replicabil-
ity of our results, and for timely production and replica-
tion of results to help inform major funding decisions in
SSA countries that are developing investment plans for
HIV. Replicability is important in the context of the
study presented here, because we hope to inform long-
term government and donor funding decisions in SSA
countries.
Using 2014 Spectrum files (currently, UNAIDS has
released updated 2015 Spectrum files, available here:
http://apps.unaids.org/spectrum/),
we
adjust
epi-
demiological parameters for model fit based on instruc-
tions and parameter ranges provided by the Goals
manual.24 We include key prevention services—preven-
tion of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) screening
and
treatment,
voluntary
counselling
and
testing,
condom distribution, voluntary medical male circumci-
sion (VMMC), and interventions on vulnerable popula-
tions such as female sex workers, men who have sex with
men, and injection drug users. Rates of VMMC in
Nigeria, Kenya and Ethiopia are already above the
UNAIDS target level. These countries, historically, have
had high VMMC rates, believed to be driven by cultural
and religious practices. Therefore, there is no reason to
believe that they will require additional financing to
maintain their already high rates of circumcision. Thus,
for these three countries, we exclude the costs of VMMC
in the total estimates. For the remaining countries,

 under the scale-up scenario, we assume a one-time
scale-up of VMMC in 2015, and for subsequent years
provide VMMC only to men who newly enter the cohort.
For PMTCT, we assume universal screening of all preg-
nant women for HIV in line with PMTCT guidelines. We
calculate the annual number of pregnant women using
a modified version of the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC) point-in-time estimates approach
(see online supplementary appendix for details). We
also assume that 2.84% of patients on ART will transition
from first-line to second-line regimen annually.25
We estimate for the nine countries the financing
needs for different scale-up scenarios by varying treat-
ment initiation threshold (eligibility at CD4 count CD4
<500/mm3 and all HIV-positive individuals) and cover-
age level for prevention and treatment interventions (at
‘current’ coverage levels, and a ‘scale-up scenario’ reach-
ing ‘universal’ coverage as defined by UNAIDS). We ran
the model for two health system capacity levels for each
of the two different treatment eligibility guidelines to
generate four scenarios: (1) scenario 1—treatment initi-
ation threshold at CD4 <500/mm3 and current ART and
prevention
coverage
levels;
(2)
scenario
2—all
HIV-positive individuals initiated on ART and current
ART coverage and prevention levels maintained; (3)
scenario 3—treatment initiation threshold at CD4 <500/
mm3 with ART and prevention coverage scaled up to
universal coverage and (4) scenario 4—all HIV-positive
individuals initiated on ART, with ART coverage and pre-
vention levels scaled up to reach universal coverage.
We estimate resources required for the nine countries
for time horizons up to 2015, 2025, 2035 and 2050. In
line with the UNAIDS HIV investment framework, we
add 20% to the prevention and treatment costs to
account for structural costs.26
We use unit cost data for treatment-related services
from two sources: the MATCH study (Ethiopia, Malawi,
Rwanda, South Africa, Zambia)27 and Menzies et al28
(Botswana, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Uganda). While noting
limitations, to our knowledge, the two studies are the
most representative costing studies to date. With the
assumption that non-antiretroviral (ARV) costs, includ-
ing costs for personnel, supplies, infrastructure, labora-
tory,
facility-level
training,
equipment,
building
maintenance and administrative support, vary by the
country’s economic status, we regress the non-ARV costs
by Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita of study
countries to derive the linear relationships that allow us
to estimate the non-ARV costs for other countries.
We set first-line ARV cost at US$132 per person per
year (2012 USD), as suggested by the MATCH study, and
second-line ARV cost at US$366 (2013 USD) as sug-
gested by the Clinton Health Access Initiative. Unit costs
for key prevention services were based on regional
averages used by the 2011 HIV Investment Framework.13
We converted all unit costs that were to 2014 USD using
the Consumer Price Indices from the Bureau of Labor
Statistics.29
To account for future increase in cost of resources
(eg, human resources, supplies, etc), we conduct separ-
ate analyses that assume a rate of increase in line with
average GDP per capita. We use International Monetary
Fund (IMF) World Economic Outlook projected GDP
per capita growth rate of 2.5% for SSA. As the IMF pub-
lishes projections through 2020 only, and we extrapolate
through 2050, we assume an annual growth rate of GDP
per capita of 2.5%, in line with the outer years of IMF
projections.30 This set of estimates is provided in the
online
supplementary
appendix.
We
estimate
the
present value of costs at 2014 USD, which form future
funding obligations for SSA using discount rates of 3%
as recommended by WHO,31 and 5% as used in earlier
studies.32
We use data from Resch et al33 to quantify health
expenditures in SSA for HIV from domestic and inter-
national sources to illustrate the gap between current
expenditures and funding obligation. Viewing these
financing obligations as ‘HIV debt’, we compare them to
the countries’ current total public debt.i We derive ratios
comparing the countries’ current total public debt to
GDP per capita, HIV debt to GDP per capita, and the
sum of the two debts to GDP per capita.
We provide a summary of the current and universal
coverage levels for different interventions modelled, and
the assumptions made regarding costs and health out-
comes in the online supplementary appendix.
RESULTS
We first present the financing needs for 2015 for the
nine
sub-Saharan
countries,
unadjusted
for
future
increase in cost of resources at the level of GDP per
capita increase. With eligibility for treatment initiation at
CD4 count of <500/mm3, where current treatment and
prevention
coverage
levels
are
maintained
with
a
growing population level (scenario 1) requires US$4.1
billion. Projected annual costs with 3% discounting are
US$3.2 billion, US$2.4 billion and US$1.8 billion in
2025, 2035 and 2050, respectively. Changing the eligibil-
ity for treatment initiation to all HIV-positive individuals
at current coverage levels (scenario 2), increases the pro-
jected cost to US$5.0 billion in 2015, declining there-
after to US$3.7 billion, US$2.5 billion and US$1.8
billion in 2025, 2035 and 2050, respectively.
Expanding access to achieve universal treatment cover-
age for SSA, with eligibility for treatment initiation at
CD4 count of <500/mm3 (scenario 3) would require
annual resources of US$11.2 billion in 2015. With 3%
discounting projected costs for 2025, 2035 and 2050
would be US$8.5 billion, US$6.1 billion and US$4.5
billion, respectively.
iTotal external debt is defined by the World Bank as ‘the sum of
public, publicly guaranteed, and private nonguaranteed long-term
debt, use of IMF credit, and short-term debt’ (http://data.worldbank.

 Extending treatment eligibility to all HIV-positive indi-
viduals and expanding prevention (scenario 4) would
increase the annual cost projection to US$12.8 billion in
2015, declining thereafter to US$8.7 billon, US$6.1
billion and US$4.5 billion in 2025, 2035 and 2050,
respectively. In figure 1, we see that the resources
required for all four scenarios decrease steadily over
time, and the scale-up scenarios decrease at a steeper
rate than the current coverage scenarios.
We next provide the present value of future financing
needs (using discount rates of 3% and 5%) for the nine
SSA countries under the four HIV treatment scenarios
and three time horizons.
Under scenario 1 (treatment initiation at CD4 count
of <500/mm3 and current coverage levels maintained)
the present values of future financing needs for the
nine countries at 3% discount rate are US$68 billion
for
2015–2035
and
US$98
billion
for
2015–2050,
respectively. At 5% discount rate for scenario 1, the
present values of future obligations for 2015–2035 and
2015–2050
are
US$58
billion
and
US$75
billion,
respectively. If all HIV-positive infected individuals were
eligible for treatment, and current coverage levels main-
tained (scenario 2), at discount rates of 3% and 5%,
the present value of obligations for 2015–2050 would
be
US$109
billion
and
US$85
billion,
respectively
(figure 2).
Under scenario 3 (universal coverage with eligibility
for treatment initiation at CD4 count of <500/mm3), the
present value of financing needs for the nine countries
for 2015–2050 would be US$255 billion and US$196
billion at 3% and 5% discount rates, respectively. Under
scenario 4, where all HIV-positive infected individuals
were eligible for treatment with universal coverage, for
2015–2050, the present value of financing obligations
would rise to US$261 billion and US$202 billion at 3%
and 5% discount rates, respectively (figure 2).
We then estimate the present value of resources
required by the nine sub-Saharan countries for 2015–
2050 at 3% discount rate with the costs of human
resource
and
supplies
increasing
by
the
projected
annual growth of GDP per capita of 2.5%. These esti-
mates suggest the cumulative resources required to be
US$146 billion for scenario 1, US$378 billion for scen-
ario 2, US$161 billion for scenario 3, and US$384 billion
for scenario 4 (online supplementary figure S1, with
annual resources required presented in online supple-
mentary figure S2).
Figure
3
explores
the
distribution
of
resources
required between treatment, prevention and structure
costs for the four scenarios. For all four scenarios, we
see a steady decline in the proportion of treatment cost
over time, and an increase in the proportion of preven-
tion costs. The decline in treatment costs can be
explained by the fact that the number of adults on treat-
ment decreases with time. As expected, prevention costs
increase over time because they are invested mostly in
non-infected populations, which increases with popula-
tion growth.
While total prevention costs increase over time due to
rapid expansion of the population, per capita invest-
ment in HIV treatment declines rapidly, as with the
declines observed in incidence, prevalence and mortal-
ity, as the benefits of prevention and treatment are rea-
lised (figure 4).ii
We next provide for the nine sub-Saharan countries
with different HIV prevalence and levels of GDP per
capita (table 1) expenditures from domestic and inter-
national sources, and estimates of resource needs for
treatment, key prevention services, and structural costs
in 2015.
Figure 5 shows the resources required in 2015, by com-
parison with the countries’ level of domestic and inter-
national sources.
Figure 5 shows that current spending for HIV in the
selected countries is driven by external donor assistance.
Of all the countries studied, South Africa has the largest
resource needs, but it also contributes the largest pro-
portion (82%) of resource needs at current coverage
rates from domestic budgets. Nigeria and Kenya repre-
sent the countries with the next highest burden and
resource needs, but they contribute only 21% from
domestic expenditure while 79% is funded through
external aid. All other countries contribute between
10% and 14% of their current resource needs (at
current coverage rates) from domestic sources.
With scale-up of treatment under both treatment
threshold scenarios, the estimated resource needs in all
Figure 1
Annual resources required by nine sub-Saharan
countries (US$ billions) from 2015 to 2050 (3% discounting).
iiThe variation in the annual resources required over time reflects not
only the changes in HIV incidence and prevalence but also population
growth, since prevention services are scaled linearly by population size.
For example, resources required in the scale-up scenarios are greater
than status quo scenarios due to population growth, even though HIV
incidence and prevalence decrease faster in the former. To simplify the
interpretation of these figures, we artificially excluded the effect of
population growth to derive the present value of financing obligations
for 2015–2050. Holding the population size and per capita resources
required constant at the 2015 level, the total resources required for the
four scenarios are presented in the online supplementary figure S3.

 key prevention services from 2015 to 2035, with 3%
annual discount
rate), and total debt-to-GDP ratio
(adding public and HIV debts) for nine SSA countries,
are presented in figure 6. While in 2014, the ratio of
public debt-to-GDP was 76% for Malawi and 37% for
Uganda, we estimate that with the addition of new
funding obligations for HIV—which arise implicitly
through commitment to achieve higher than current
ART coverage levels—overall ‘financial obligations’ (the
sum of debt levels and the present value of the stock of
future HIV obligations) rise to 117% for Malawi, and
66% for Uganda).
DISCUSSION
In the nine SSA countries, the estimated resources
required for HIV prevention and treatment in 2015–
2050 are large. At 3% discount rate, they range from US
$98 billion to maintain current coverage levels for ART
and prevention with eligibility for treatment initiation at
CD4 count of <500/mm3 to US$261 billion if ART were
to be extended to all HIV-positive individuals and pre-
vention scaled up. This range extends from US$136
billion to US$359 billion if costs of human resources
and supplies increase at the rate of GDP per capita.
These financing needs create long-term financing
obligations with fiscal challenges, as Haacker notes.21 As
‘hidden debt’, these obligations pose fiscal and debt sus-
tainability challenges for the sub-Saharan countries that
lack the domestic financial resources, fiscal flexibility
and economic strength.
There is an ethical responsibility to continue financing
for those receiving ART, and not abandon them to
death.34 The responsibility extends to people in equal
need of ART but who have not yet gained access to treat-
ment. A durable HIV response,35 36 underpinned by sus-
tained financing37 and effective health systems, is critical
to protect the gains and sustain HIV response. However,
Lule and Haacker38 raise concerns on the fiscal dimen-
sion of HIV for affected countries, which need to under-
stand the magnitude of future expenditures for HIV,
and
the
health
and
economic
benefits
of
these
expenditures.
We show that ‘front-loading’ investments in HIV
scale-up now to ensure high levels of coverage will sig-
nificantly reduce future HIV incidence and prevalence
by realising the long-term preventive effects of ART to
reduce HIV transmission. Investing upfront also trans-
lates into lower future expenditures as indicated by
figures 3 and 4, but lower treatment costs are partly
offset by the scaling up of prevention expenses.
These expenditures need to be funded from some-
where. Potential sources of funding include domestic
financing, development assistance for health (DAH) and
innovative financing.
Domestic financing is the most important source of
funding for HIV. In 2011, however, only 8 of the 48 SSA

 countries had reached the Abuja target of allocating
15% of government budget to health.34 Fiscal space con-
siderations
mean
that
government
budgets
of
HIV-affected countries will be constrained. Potential
sources of additional domestic financing include higher
tax revenues, with expansion of the formal sector with
economic growth, and more effective tax collection, new
revenues
natural
resources,
health
insurance
(as
sub-Saharan countries move to implement universal
health coverage) and better channelling of health and
HIV budgets to cost-effective interventions.
With global economic malaise and the climate of aus-
terity, DAH has plateaued since 201039 and is unlikely to
increase significantly in the near term. But the long-
term funding needs for HIV have created ‘contingent
liabilities’ for affected countries. While these contingent
liabilities are ‘off balance sheet’ or ‘off budget’, and
hence may not be recorded officially as debt, they must
be met. ‘Debt sustainability’ remains a critical issue not
just for HIV-affected countries but also donors who are
encumbered
by
high
levels
of
sovereign
debt.
Concessional finance or debt guarantees from the World
Bank and the Global Fund could help HIV-affected
countries to borrow on more favourable terms to invest
in HIV prevention, effectively leverage international
financial flows, and replace the short donor replenish-
ment cycles that are mismatched with long-term finan-
cing needs.
Innovative financing, which in 2002–2012 raised more
than US$6.0 billion40 from the Airline Solidarity Levy,41
the Children’s Investment Fund Management,42 and the
International Finance Facility for Immunization,43 offers
a further source of funding, including from social
impact
bonds,
social
development
bonds,
diaspora
bonds,
sovereign
bonds
securitised
against
future
revenue streams from extractive industries, and con-
sumption taxes on alcohol and tobacco. Innovative
financing also offers the opportunity to integrate donor
and domestic responses and ‘front-load’ HIV spending,
as
have
been
done
through
Advance
Market
Commitments for pneumococcal vaccine.44
In addition to new additional financial resources, effi-
ciency savings in health systems could create substantial
fiscal space by achieving higher HIV treatment and pre-
vention coverage without budgetary increases. The IMF
estimates that up to 50% of health expenditures, equal
to 1–3% of total GDP in LMIC, may be wasted.45
Our estimates have met the limitations experienced by
earlier studies aimed at projecting future costs of HIV.
First, limited systematic cost and outcome data increases
the uncertainties on future costs and benefits of inter-
ventions, especially as the theoretical and empirical
understanding of the relationships between coverage
rates, unit costs and scale of programmes is not well
developed.
Second,
Spectrum
modelling
does
not
incorporate a dynamic health systems component that
takes into account individual behaviour to enrol in
health services to receive ART at a given system capacity.
There is, hence, a need for agent-based dynamic models
that capture individual behaviours and their interaction
with health systems. Third, the need for prevention ser-
vices may be linked to incidence and projected preva-
lence over time, which are likely to decline as incidence
levels fall. However, we took a conservative approach in
assuming that the commitment to prevention remains
the same, independent for underlying need for preven-
tion services.
HIV-positive individuals receiving ART will experience
immune suppression from long-term effects of ART and
HIV infection, and develop comorbidities,46 as well as
chronic illness due to ageing, unrelated to HIV or ART.
These morbidities will result in additional costs for
health systems.32 This is why, as with the HIV Investment
Framework, we included in our model 20% cost for
health systems in addition to costs of prevention and
ART.11
More than 35 years into the HIV epidemic, the quality
and
quantity
of
data
are
unacceptably
low,
