BACKGROUND
Venous disease is the most common cause of leg ulceration. Although compression 
therapy improves venous ulcer healing, it does not treat the underlying causes of ve-
nous hypertension. Treatment of superficial venous reflux has been shown to reduce 
the rate of ulcer recurrence, but the effect of early endovenous ablation of superficial 
venous reflux on ulcer healing remains unclear.
METHODS
In a trial conducted at 20 centers in the United Kingdom, we randomly assigned 450 
patients with venous leg ulcers to receive compression therapy and undergo early endo-
venous ablation of superficial venous reflux within 2 weeks after randomization (early-
intervention group) or to receive compression therapy alone, with consideration of 
endovenous ablation deferred until after the ulcer was healed or until 6 months after 
randomization if the ulcer was unhealed (deferred-intervention group). The primary 
outcome was the time to ulcer healing. Secondary outcomes were the rate of ulcer 
healing at 24 weeks, the rate of ulcer recurrence, the length of time free from ulcers 
(ulcer-free time) during the first year after randomization, and patient-reported health-
related quality of life.
RESULTS
Patient and clinical characteristics at baseline were similar in the two treatment 
groups. The time to ulcer healing was shorter in the early-intervention group than in 
the deferred-intervention group; more patients had healed ulcers with early interven-
tion (hazard ratio for ulcer healing, 1.38; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.13 to 1.68; 
P 
= 
0.001). The median time to ulcer healing was 56 days (95% CI, 49 to 66) in the 
early-intervention group and 82 days (95% CI, 69 to 92) in the deferred-intervention 
group. The rate of ulcer healing at 24 weeks was 85.6% in the early-intervention group 
and 76.3% in the deferred-intervention group. The median ulcer-free time during the 
first year after trial enrollment was 306 days (interquartile range, 240 to 328) in the 
early-intervention group and 278 days (interquartile range, 175 to 324) in the deferred-
intervention group (P 
= 
0.002). The most common procedural complications of endo-
venous ablation were pain and deep-vein thrombosis.
CONCLUSIONS
Early endovenous ablation of superficial venous reflux resulted in faster healing of 
venous leg ulcers and more time free from ulcers than deferred endovenous ablation.

V
enous disease is the most common 
cause of leg ulceration, and compression 
therapy improves venous ulcer healing.1,2 
Superficial venous reflux (varicose veins) is usu-
ally present in patients with venous leg ulcers.3 
Endovenous interventions (ultrasound-guided 
foam sclerotherapy and thermal and nonthermal 
ablation) are effective, minimally invasive proce-
dures that are used for the treatment of varicose 
veins and have largely replaced traditional sur-
gery at many centers.4-6 In the Effect of Surgery 
and Compression on Healing and Recurrence 
(ESCHAR) study, superficial venous surgery in 
combination with compression therapy resulted 
in lower rates of recurrence of venous leg ulcers 
than compression therapy alone7,8 but was not 
associated with higher rates of ulcer healing. 
Observational studies have suggested that endo-
venous treatment of varicose veins — a treat-
ment that may be particularly appropriate for the 
elderly population with venous leg ulcers — may 
improve ulcer healing.9-12 However, a lack of reli-
able evidence has resulted in weak support for 
endovenous ablation in current management 
guidelines.13,14 We performed the Early Venous 
Reflux Ablation (EVRA) trial to evaluate the role 
of early endovenous treatment of superficial 
venous reflux as an adjunct to compression ther-
apy in patients with venous leg ulcers.
Methods
Trial Design and Oversight
The EVRA trial was a multicenter, parallel-group, 
randomized, controlled trial that was funded by 
the National Institute for Health Research Health 
Technology Assessment Program. Details of the 
trial design and implementation are provided in 
the protocol, which is available with the full text 
of this article at NEJM.org.15 The trial was ap-
proved by the South West–Central Bristol Re-
search Ethics Committee, and trial oversight 
was provided by an independent trial steering 
committee and an independent data and safety 
monitoring committee (the members of these 
committees are listed in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix, available at NEJM.org). Data were col-
lected by trial staff at each recruitment center 
and were uploaded to the Web-based electronic 
data-capture system (InForm, Oracle Health Sci-
ences). The authors vouch for the accuracy and 
completeness of the data and analyses and for 
the fidelity of the trial to the protocol.
Trial Setting and Patients
From October 2013 through September 2016, 
patients with open venous leg ulcers were screened 
by personnel in the vascular surgery depart-
ments at 20 participating centers across the 
United Kingdom (Table S1 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). All the centers had established refer-
ral pathways for patients with venous leg ulcers 
and could provide early endovenous interven-
tions. Patients were screened for eligibility by 
clinical assessment and duplex ultrasonography.
Eligibility Criteria
Patients older than 18 years of age were eligible 
for inclusion if they had an open venous leg ul-
cer that had been present for a period of be-
tween 6 weeks and 6 months, an ankle–brachial 
index of 0.8 or higher, and primary or recurrent 
superficial venous reflux that was deemed by the 
treating clinician to be clinically significant. 
Venous reflux was defined as a duration of retro-
grade flow of greater than 0.5 seconds in super-
ficial veins and greater than 1 second in deep 
veins.16 The presence of deep venous reflux was 
recorded but was not an exclusion criterion. Pa-
tients were excluded if they were pregnant, were 
unable to adhere to compression therapy, had 
deep venous occlusive disease or any other con-
dition precluding superficial venous ablation, 
had leg ulcers for which the cause was deemed 
to be nonvenous, or were thought to require skin 
grafting. In patients with venous leg ulcers in 
both legs, the leg with more severe disease (as 
determined by the patient) was designated as the 
“reference leg” and was included in the outcome 
analyses. Written informed consent was obtained 
from all participants.
Randomization
Randomization sequences for each recruitment 
center were created with the use of randomly 
permuted blocks with two block sizes; the se-
quences had been prepared in advance by a trial 
statistician and uploaded to the data-capture sys-
tem before recruitment. Treatment assignment 
was concealed as follows: each potential partici-
pant was enrolled in the data-capture system by 
staff at the local recruitment centers and, if eligi-
bility was confirmed, was automatically assigned 
the next available entry in the appropriate ran-
domization list. Participants were randomly as-
signed, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive compression 
therapy and undergo early endovenous ablation 
 n engl j med

Early Endovenous Ablation in Venous Ulceration
(early-intervention group) or to receive compres-
sion therapy alone, with consideration of endo-
venous ablation deferred (deferred-intervention 
group).
Trial Interventions
Compression therapy was administered by trained 
community and hospital-based nursing teams 
according to the local standard of care. Multi-
layer elastic compression (two to four layers), 
short-stretch compression, and compression ho-
siery were all deemed to be acceptable.17
Among the patients assigned to the early-
intervention group, the aim was for superficial 
venous reflux to be ablated within 2 weeks af-
ter randomization. Among the patients in the 
deferred-intervention group, an ablation proce-
dure was considered after the ulcer had healed 
or at least 6 months after randomization if the 
ulcer had not healed. After the ulcer was healed, 
patients were offered elastic compression stock-
ings according to local institutional policy. In both 
treatment groups, delivery of wound care and 
frequency of clinical follow-up were guided by 
local models of care.
Endovenous laser or radiofrequency ablation, 
ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy, or non-
thermal, nontumescent methods of treatment 
(such as cyanoacrylate glue or mechanochemical 
ablation) were performed either alone or in com-
bination. The treating clinical team determined 
the method and strategy of endovenous treat-
ment. For all interventions, treating clinicians 
were asked to ablate the main refluxing truncal 
vein, treat to the lowest point of reflux where 
possible, and continue compression therapy im-
mediately after endovenous treatment. Among the 
patients in the early-intervention group, duplex 
ultrasonography was to be performed 6 weeks 
after the intervention. Superficial venous reflux 
observed during follow-up was treated at the 
discretion of the treating clinician.
Outcome Assessments
The primary outcome measure was the time to 
ulcer healing from the date of randomization 
through 12 months. The definition of ulcer heal-
ing used in the trial is provided in the Supple-
mentary Appendix. Data from patients in whom 
no ulcer healing had been verified by 12 months 
after randomization were censored at the date of 
their last follow-up examination.
The secondary outcome measures were the 
rate of ulcer healing at 24 weeks, the rate of ulcer 
recurrence, the length of time free from ulcers 
(ulcer-free time) during the first year after ran-
domization, and patient-reported health-related 
quality of life. Ulcer-free time was assessed only 
in patients who completed 1 year of follow-up. 
Clinical disease severity was assessed with the 
Venous Clinical Severity Score assessment tool 
(scores range from 0 to 30, with higher scores 
indicating more severe venous disease)18 at ran-
domization and 6 weeks after randomization. 
A disease-specific quality-of-life assessment (the 
Aberdeen Varicose Vein Questionnaire; scores 
range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indi-
cating worse health related to varicose veins)19 
and two generic quality-of-life assessments (the 
EuroQol Group 5-Dimension 5-Level question-
naire [EQ-5D-5L; scores on the visual-analogue 
health scale range from 0 to 100 and scores on 
the descriptive health index range from 0 to 1, 
with higher scores indicating better quality of 
life] and the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item 
Short-Form Health Survey [SF-36; scores range 
from 1 to 100, with higher scores indicating bet-
ter quality of life]) were performed at randomiza-
tion and at 6 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months 
after randomization (Tables S2 through S5 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). A health economic 
analysis was prespecified in the trial protocol, 
but the results are not reported in the current 
article.
Statistical Analysis
Assuming a 60% rate of ulcer healing at 24 weeks 
among the patients who received compression 
therapy alone and anticipating a 10% rate of loss 
to follow-up, we estimated that with 254 events 
(healed leg ulcers) among a total of 416 patients, 
the trial would have 90% power to detect a 15 
percentage-point difference between the treatment 
groups in the healing rate at 24 weeks at a two-
sided alpha level of 5% (log-rank test). To further 
allow for protocol violations and unexpected drop-
outs, the target sample size was 450 patients.
We tested the hypothesis that there would be 
no difference in the time to healing between the 
early-intervention group and the deferred-inter-
vention group, first using an unadjusted Cox 
regression model with recruitment center as a 
random effect (prespecified primary analysis) 
and subsequently adjusting for the age of the 
patients, the length of time that the ulcer had 
been present (ulcer duration, also known as ulcer 
 n engl j med nejm.org

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
chronicity), and the size of the ulcers. Unadjusted 
rates of ulcer healing at 12 weeks and 24 weeks 
were calculated with the Kaplan–Meier method.20 
Recurrence rates at 1 year were calculated as the 
percentage of patients in whom the ulcer had 
healed within 1 year after randomization but re-
curred before the end of the 1-year postrandom-
ization follow-up period. Ulcer-free time was 
calculated as the number of days during the 
1-year follow-up period on which the reference 
leg was fully healed. Ordered logistic regression 
(with ulcer-free time categorized in quartiles) was 
used to assess the effect of early versus deferred 
intervention on ulcer-free time. The difference 
between the two treatment groups in each mea-
sure of quality of life was assessed at each follow-
up time point with the use of mixed models that 
were adjusted separately for participant age, ulcer 
size, and ulcer duration and included recruitment 
center as a random effect. All analyses were per-
formed on an intention-to-treat basis with STATA 
software, version 14.2 (StataCorp), with statistical 
significance set at a two-sided alpha level of 5%.
Results
Patients
From October 2013 through September 2016, a 
total of 6555 patients were screened, 6105 were 
excluded, and 450 consented to participate in the 
EVRA trial and underwent randomization (Fig. 1). 
The most common reasons for ineligibility were 
an ulcer that had been present for more than 
6 months (1772 patients), arterial disease (de-
fined as an ankle–brachial index <0.8 or the 
presence of an arterial ulcer or both; 873 pa-
tients), or an ulcer that had already healed by the 
time of randomization (610 patients). The most 
common reason for potentially eligible patients 
not undergoing randomization was a treatment 
preference expressed by either the patient or the 
treating clinician.

Shown are the cumulative numbers of patients who had 
withdrawn, had died, had not adhered to the protocol, 
or had been lost to follow­up by each follow­up time 
point. Patients assigned to the early­intervention group 
received compression therapy and underwent early en­
dovenous ablation of superficial venous reflux within  
2 weeks after randomization, and the patients assigned 
to the deferred­intervention group received compression 
therapy, with consideration of endovenous treatment 
deferred until after the ulcer had healed or until 6 months 
after randomization if the ulcer was unhealed. Treatment 
protocol violations occurred in 32 patients in the early­

Endovenous Interventions
Among the 224 patients in the early-intervention 
group, 203 (90.6%) underwent an endovenous 
procedure within 2 weeks after randomization 
(Table 2). One patient (0.4%) who was assigned 
to the deferred-intervention group but was mis-
takenly thought to be in the early-intervention 
group underwent an endovenous procedure with-
in 2 weeks after randomization. Among the 105 
patients in the deferred-intervention group who 
underwent an endovenous procedure within 
6 months after randomization, 6 (5.7%) were 
treated before the ulcer had healed, including 
the 1 patient who underwent an endovenous 
procedure within 2 weeks after randomization 
in error, 3 patients who had clinical deteriora-
tion of the ulcer, and 2 patients who were un-
willing to continue the deferred-intervention 
strategy and requested intervention. A total of 
218 of 224 patients (97.3%) in the early-interven-
tion group and 171 of 226 patients (75.7%) in 
the deferred-intervention group underwent an 
endovenous intervention within 1 year after ran-
domization.
Among the 389 patients who underwent an 
endovenous intervention in the trial, 472 proce-
dures were performed within 1 year after ran-
domization (Table S7 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix). A total of 215 patients underwent duplex 
ultrasonography at 6 weeks after the interven-
tion; in 179 of these patients (83.3%), the treated 
segments were observed to be completely ablated 
(as assessed by the local principal investigator). 
Among the 36 patients with incomplete ablation, 
20 underwent a repeat intervention.
Primary Outcome
The time to ulcer healing was shorter in the 
early-intervention group than in the deferred-
intervention group; more patients had healed 
ulcers with early intervention (hazard ratio for 
ulcer healing, 1.38; 95% confidence interval [CI], 
1.13 to 1.68; P 
= 
0.001) (Fig. 2). The median time 
to ulcer healing was 56 days (95% CI, 49 to 66) 
in the early-intervention group and 82 days (95% 
CI, 69 to 92) in the deferred-intervention group.

Up to 6 months after randomization, the intervention was performed before 
ulcer healing in 6 patients in the deferred­intervention group: 3 patients had 
clinical deterioration of the ulcer, 2 patients were unwilling to continue the 
 
deferred­intervention strategy and requested intervention, and 1 patient was 
treated early in error. After 6 months, the intervention was performed before 
ulcer healing in 19 patients, as decided by the treating clinical team.

The timing is reported for the first endovenous intervention only. The timing  
of any additional intervention was left to the discretion of the treating clinician.
‡  
Among the 55 patients (24.3%) in the deferred­intervention group who did 
not receive treatment by 1 year after randomization, the ulcer had healed in 
27 and had not healed in 9 (the reasons for not undergoing endovenous treat­
ment were not recorded for these 9 patients); among the remaining 19 patients, 
7 had died, 7 had withdrawn from the trial, and 5 were lost to follow­up. Among 
the 27 patients with healed ulcers, 16 declined intervention, 3 were no longer 
deemed to be suitable for intervention (as determined by the treating clinician), 
and 6 were on the waiting list for intervention and may have been treated after 
12 months; the reason for not receiving treatment was unclear in 2 patients.

Early Endovenous Ablation in Venous Ulceration
After adjustment for patient age, ulcer size, ulcer 
duration, and recruitment center, the results were 
consistent, with quicker ulcer healing in the 
early-intervention group than in the deferred-
intervention group (hazard ratio, 1.42; 95% CI, 
1.16 to 1.73; P 
= 
0.001).
Secondary Outcomes
The unadjusted Kaplan–Meier time-to-event rate 
of ulcer healing was higher in the early-interven-
tion group than in the deferred-intervention 
group at 24 weeks (85.6% [95% CI, 80.6 to 89.8] 
vs. 76.3% [95% CI, 70.5 to 81.7]). In a post hoc 
analysis, the rates of ulcer healing at 12 weeks 
were 63.5% (95% CI, 57.2 to 69.8) in the early-
intervention group and 51.6% (95% CI, 45.2 to 
58.3) in the deferred-intervention group. Among 
the 450 patients who underwent randomization, 
404 (89.7%) had healed ulcers within 1 year after 
randomization (210 of 224 [93.8%] in the early-
intervention group and 194 of 226 [85.8%] in the 
deferred-intervention group). The between-group 
difference in healing rates at 1 year was 8.0 per-
centage points (95% CI, 2.3 to 13.5).
Among the 404 patients whose ulcers had 
healed within 1 year after randomization, the 
rate of ulcer recurrence before the end of the 
1-year postrandomization follow-up period was 
11.4% (24 of 210 patients) in the early-interven-
tion group and 16.5% (32 of 194 patients) in the 
deferred-intervention group. The total length of 
follow-up after ulcer healing was 156.5 person-
years in the early-intervention group and 139.7 
person-years in the deferred-intervention group; 
the rate of ulcer recurrence was lower in the 
early-intervention group than in the deferred-
intervention group by 0.08 events per person-year 
(95% CI, −0.02 to 0.18). The median ulcer-free 
time during the 1-year follow-up was 306 days 
(interquartile range, 240 to 328) among 204 pa-
tients in the early-intervention group and 278 days 
(interquartile range, 175 to 324) among 203 pa-
tients in the deferred-intervention group (P 
= 
0.002 
by the Mann–Whitney test). Adjustment for pa-
tient age, ulcer size, ulcer duration, and recruit-
ment center did not significantly affect the re-
sults. However, patients in the early-intervention 
group were more likely to have longer ulcer-free 
time than those in the deferred-intervention 
group (odds ratio of being in a higher quartile 
of ulcer-free time, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.07 to 2.21; 
P 
= 
0.02). Mean (±SD) scores on the Venous 
Clinical Severity Score assessment tool did not 
differ significantly between the two treatment 
groups at randomization (15.8±3.3 in the early-
intervention group and 15.7±3.1 in the deferred-
intervention group). At 6 weeks, scores on the 
Venous Clinical Severity Score assessment tool 
were 10.5±4.7 in the early-intervention group 
and 12.6±4.4 in the deferred-intervention group.
Quality-of-life outcomes are summarized in 
Table 3, and in Tables S8 (SF-36 domain scores) 
and S9 (includes multiple imputation of missing 
values) in the Supplementary Appendix. At base-
line, scores on the Aberdeen Varicose Vein Ques-
tionnaire, EQ-5D-5L, and SF-36 were similar in 
the early-intervention group and the deferred-
intervention group. There was no clear difference 
in Aberdeen Varicose Vein Questionnaire scores 
between the treatment groups over the follow-up 
period, although scores were generally lower 
(indicating better disease-specific quality of 
life) in the early-intervention group than in the 
deferred-intervention group. Similarly, there was 
no clear difference between the treatment groups 
in the EQ-5D-5L index value during the follow-up 
period. Observed differences were not deemed 
to be significant when adjustment was made for 
multiple testing.
A total of 163 protocol deviations were re-
corded in the treatment groups, the majority of 
which were due to late or missed follow-up ap-

Discussion
This multicenter, pragmatic, randomized trial 
showed that early endovenous ablation of super-
ficial venous reflux as an adjunct to compression 
therapy was associated with a significantly shorter 
time to healing of venous leg ulcers than com-
pression therapy alone. Patients assigned to the 
early-intervention group also had longer ulcer-free 
time during the first year after randomization.
Previous studies have also shown a benefit of 
superficial venous intervention in patients with 
venous leg ulcers. The ESCHAR study showed 
that the rate of ulcer recurrence was lower with 
superficial venous surgery as an adjunct to com-
pression therapy than with compression therapy 
alone,7,8 and for this reason, the treatment of 
superficial venous reflux is recommended in 
international guidelines for the management of 
venous ulcers.13 However, worldwide, many pa-
tients with venous leg ulcers are not assessed or 
treated for superficial venous reflux, possibly be-
cause of the perception that treatment for vari-
cose veins does not improve ulcer healing.13,22
In the current trial, we found that faster ulcer 
healing can be attained if an endovenous inter-
vention is performed promptly. This benefit was 
observed despite the provision of high-quality 
compression therapy, which might explain the 
good healing rates observed in both treatment 
groups. Such effective compression therapy is 
probably not commonplace outside randomized 
trials, which may help explain the much slower 
healing times seen in the “real world.”23,24 Ac-
cordingly, the improvement in ulcer healing with 
early endovenous intervention is likely to be 
greater in clinical practice than was observed in 
this trial. Because endovenous intervention is 
usually performed as a single procedure, the 
clinical benefits are likely to be less dependent 
on ongoing patient adherence than they would 
be with compression therapy.
Pathways of care for leg ulcers, in general, do 
not include a provision for early assessment and 
treatment of superficial venous reflux.22 The lack 
of standardized models of care for leg ulcers and 
the involvement of a range of specialists may 
contribute to the inconsistent care delivered.
Although a benefit of endovenous intervention 
was observed in the current trial, the best meth-
od of ablation among those currently available 
remains unclear. In this pragmatic trial, treating 
clinicians were permitted to use the method of 
treatment for superficial venous reflux that they 
deemed to be most appropriate for the patients 
in their center. Ultrasound-guided foam sclero-
therapy was the most common method of treat-
ment used, which probably reflects the versatil-
ity and acceptability of this minimally invasive 
procedure. Results of large randomized studies 
have suggested that the rate of technical success 
(i.e., complete venous occlusion) may be lower 
with foam sclerotherapy than with endovenous 
thermal ablation.5,6 Whether this difference in 
the rate of complete venous occlusion will result 
in differing rates of ulcer recurrence in the me-
dium or long term remains to be seen.
Our trial has several limitations. First, al-
though all the recruitment centers had an estab-
lished pathway of care for leg ulcers, consider-
able variations existed among centers, the most 
notable of which was the choice of endovenous 
treatment method. All treating clinicians were 
asked to abide by standardized intervention 
principles, and by stratifying the findings ac-
cording to center, we attempted to ensure that 
any variations were equally distributed across 
the two treatment groups. Second, we screened 
more than 6500 patients to reach our target 
sample size of 450. Patients were often not eli-
gible for inclusion in the trial because the ulcer 
had been present for longer than 6 months or 
had already healed by the time of randomiza-
tion. This probably reflects failures in the refer-
ral pathways from primary care teams or wound-
care centers to the vascular center. Third, 
variations were noted in the superficial veins 
that were refluxing and the presence and extent 
of deep venous reflux. However, findings from 
the current trial support other data showing that 
the clinical benefits of treating superficial ve-
nous reflux can be attained even in the presence 
of concomitant deep venous reflux.25-27 Finally, 
follow-up duplex ultrasonography at 6 weeks 
after the intervention was required only in the 
early-intervention group; this could have led to 
more repeat procedures and a higher rate of 
 n engl j med nejm.org

procedural success in that group than in the 
deferred-intervention group.
In conclusion, this multicenter, randomized 
trial showed that early endovenous ablation of 
superficial venous reflux as an adjunct to com-
pression therapy was associated with a shorter 
time to healing of venous leg ulcers than com-
pression therapy alone.
