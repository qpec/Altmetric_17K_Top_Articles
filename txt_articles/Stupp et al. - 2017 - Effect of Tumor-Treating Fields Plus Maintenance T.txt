IMPORTANCE Tumor-treating fields (TTFields) is an antimitotic treatment modality that
interferes with glioblastoma cell division and organelle assembly by delivering low-intensity
alternating electric fields to the tumor.
OBJECTIVE To investigate whether TTFields improves progression-free and overall survival of
patients with glioblastoma, a fatal disease that commonly recurs at the initial tumor site or in
the central nervous system.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this randomized, open-label trial, 695 patients with
glioblastoma whose tumor was resected or biopsied and had completed concomitant
radiochemotherapy (median time from diagnosis to randomization, 3.8 months) were enrolled
at 83 centers (July 2009-2014) and followed up through December 2016. A preliminary report
from this trial was published in 2015; this report describes the final analysis.
INTERVENTIONS Patients were randomized 2:1 to TTFields plus maintenance temozolomide
chemotherapy (n = 466) or temozolomide alone (n = 229). The TTFields, consisting of
low-intensity, 200 kHz frequency, alternating electric fields, was delivered (� 18 hours/d) via
4 transducer arrays on the shaved scalp and connected to a portable device. Temozolomide
was administered to both groups (150-200 mg/m2) for 5 days per 28-day cycle (6-12 cycles).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Progression-free survival (tested at α = .046). The
secondary end point was overall survival (tested hierarchically at α = .048). Analyses were
performed for the intent-to-treat population. Adverse events were compared by group.
RESULTS Of the 695 randomized patients (median age, 56 years; IQR, 48-63; 473 men [68%]),
637 (92%) completed the trial. Median progression-free survival from randomization was 6.7
months in the TTFields-temozolomide group and 4.0 months in the temozolomide-alone group
(HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.52-0.76; P < .001). Median overall survival was 20.9 months in the
TTFields-temozolomide group vs 16.0 months in the temozolomide-alone group (HR, 0.63;
95% CI, 0.53-0.76; P < .001). Systemic adverse event frequency was 48% in the
TTFields-temozolomide group and 44% in the temozolomide-alone group. Mild to moderate
skin toxicity underneath the transducer arrays occurred in 52% of patients who received
TTFields-temozolomide vs no patients who received temozolomide alone.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In the final analysis of this randomized clinical trial of patients
with glioblastoma who had received standard radiochemotherapy, the addition of TTFields to
maintenance temozolomide chemotherapy vs maintenance temozolomide alone, resulted in
statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival and overall survival. These
results are consistent with the previous interim analysis.

lioblastoma is the most common and aggressive pri-
mary brain tumor with an annual incidence of 3.19 per
100 000.1-5 The disease course is typically rapid, with
only approximately 1 in 4 patients alive 2 years after diagno-
sis, and only 5% to 10% of patients alive at 5 years.1,6,7
Since the current standard of care was established, con-
sisting of surgical resection or biopsy, followed by radio-
therapy with concomitant temozolomide chemotherapy,
followed by maintenance temozolomide for 6 to 12 months,6
little progress has been made in the treatment of this
disease.3,8,9 Most trials have shown median progression-free
survival and median overall survival from diagnosis of 6.2 to
7.5 months and 14.6 to 16.7 months, respectively.4-6,8
Tumor-treating fields (TTFields) are an antimitotic treat-
ment that selectively affects dividing glioblastoma cells by
delivering low-intensity, intermediate-frequency (200 kHz)
alternating electric fields via transducer arrays applied to the
scalp.10,11 Tumor-treating fields cause mitotic arrest and apop-
tosis of rapidly dividing cells.10,11 Preclinical studies demon-
strated increased sensitivity to chemotherapy with the addi-
tion of TTFields in human glioblastoma cell lines and in
animal tumor models.12 In a randomized phase 3 trial involv-
ing 237 patients with recurrent glioblastoma whose several
lines of prior therapy had failed, TTFields monotherapy
was compared with the treating physicians’best choice of
salvage chemotherapy. Although no survival difference was
observed, the higher objective response rate (12% vs 7%) sug-
gested single-modality activity of TTFields.13
In 2009, this randomized phase 3 clinical trial was initi-
ated, comparing maintenance temozolomide alone with
maintenance temozolomide in combination with TTFields
among patients with glioblastoma. A preplanned interim
analysis involving the first 315 patients randomized was pre-
viously reported and demonstrated improved progression-
free and overall survival.14 This article reports the final
analysis involving all 695 randomized patients, with a
median follow-up of 40 months and a minimum follow-up
of 24 months.
Methods
The study was approved by the institutional review boards or
ethics committees of all participating centers, and all pa-
tients provided written informed consent before entering the
study. The trial protocol and statistical analysis plan are
included in Supplement 1.
Study Population
Patients eligible for this study were aged 18 years or older, had
a Karnofsky performance score of 70 or higher (a score of ≥70
ensures independence in activities of daily living), and had
newly diagnosed and histologically confirmed supratentorial
glioblastoma (World Health Organization [WHO] grade IV
astrocytoma15). All participants had undergone maximal safe
debulking surgery when feasible or biopsy and had com-
pleted standard radiotherapy with concomitant temozolo-
mide at the time of enrollment. Prior use of implanted
carmustine wafers was allowed. Patients with evidence of
progressive disease following radiochemotherapy, infraten-
torial tumor location, and severe comorbidities were ex-
cluded. Adequate hematological, liver, and kidney function
tests to allow for temozolomide chemotherapy were
required.6,14,16
Study Design and Treatment
This multicenter, open-label, randomized clinical phase 3 trial,
recruited 695 patients at 83 sites in North America, Europe, the
Republic of Korea, and Israel. The trial was designed to test the
efficacy and safety of TTFields in combination with best stan-
dard of care in the treatment of newly diagnosed glioblastoma.
Patients were randomized after the end of radiochemotherapy
at a ratio of 2:1 to receive standard maintenance temozolomide
chemotherapy (150-200 mg/m2/d for 5 days every 28 days for
6cycles)withorwithouttheadditionofTTFields.Tumortreat-
ing fields treatment was to be initiated at least 4 weeks but not
more than 7 weeks from the last day of radiotherapy. Mainte-
nance temozolomide was delivered in 28-day cycles according
to the protocol established by the European Organisation for
Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Brain Tumor and
Radiotherapy Groups and the National Cancer Institute of
Canada(NCIC)ClinicalTrialsGroup.6Extensionoftheduration
ofmaintenancetemozolomidebeyond6cycleswasallowedper
local practice. Randomization was performed using a central
web-based randomization system and was stratified by extent
ofresection(biopsy,partialresection,grosstotalresection)and
by the methylation status of the O6-methylguanine-DNA
methyltransferase (MGMT) gene promoter (methylated,
unmethylated, unknown).
Treatment with TTFields was delivered through 4 trans-
ducer arrays with 9 insulated electrodes each placed on the
shaved scalp and connected to a portable device set to gener-
ate 200-kHz electric fields within the brain (Optune, Novocure
Inc).TransducerarraylayoutsweredeterminedusingaTTFields

Key Points
Question Does the use of tumor-treating fields (TTFields),
consisting of low-intensity, alternating electric fields delivered
via transducer arrays applied to the scalp, when added to
maintenance temozolomide chemotherapy, improve
progression-free survival for patients with glioblastoma?
Findings In this randomized clinical trial involving 695 patients
with glioblastoma who had completed initial radiochemotherapy,
median progression-free survival from randomization was 6.7
months in the TTFields plus temozolomide group and 4.0 months
in the temozolomide-alone group (hazard ratio, 0.63), a significant
difference.
Meaning Among patients with glioblastoma, the addition of
TTFields to maintenance temozolomide chemotherapy resulted in
statistically significant improvement in survival. These results are
consistent with those reported in a previous interim analysis.

Central MGMT Testing, Pathology Review,
and Molecular Analyses
In patients with paraffin-embedded tumor tissue available,
evaluation of the MGMT methylation status was performed
using quantitative methylation-specific polymerase chain
reaction3,20 by a central laboratory licensed by MDxHealth. If
the MGMT methylation status could not be determined cen-
trally prior to randomization, local MGMT methylation status
was used for stratification. All data analyses were based on the
central blinded assessment.
Patients were included based on initial local histological
diagnosis. A retrospective pathology review and evaluation of
molecular testing was performed by a neuropathologist (B.L.)
and molecular biologist (M.E.H.). Deletion of chromosomal
arms1pand19qandamplificationoftheepidermalgrowthfac-
tor receptor (EGFR) were evaluated by fluorescent in situ hy-
bridization (FISH), immunohistochemistry (IHC), or both; and
the mutation status of the isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1)
gene was determined by immunohistochemistry for the most
common mutant IDH1-R132H as described previously.21 For
cases in which insufficient tissue was available for EGFR FISH,
the result of EGFR IHC was used as a surrogate (Hirsch score,
≥200 amplified; <200, not amplified).22
Outcomes
Primary and Secondary End Points
The primary end point was progression-free survival, and the
secondary end point was overall survival, with analyses con-
ducted in the intent-to-treat population.
The protocol defined that overall survival would be ana-
lyzed in a per-protocol population including only patients who
received their original allocated treatments. However, 26 pa-
tients (11%) in the temozolomide-alone control group crossed
over and received TTFields after December 2014, following re-
lease of the results of the interim analysis of the trial. These
26 patients had more favorable baseline characteristics than
the rest of the control patients (MGMT methylated, 48%;
Karnofsky performance score, 80-100; time from end of ra-
diotherapytorandomization,31days)andreceivedmorecycles
of temozolomide (median, 10.5 cycles). To avoid possible bias,
these patients were analyzed as randomized in the control
group according to the intent-to-treat principle.
Exploratory End Points
Other predefined exploratory end points were percentage of
patientsaliveandprogressionfreeat6months,annualizedsur-
vival rates, quality of life, Mini-Mental State Examination, and
Karnofsky performance score. The quality-of-life data are not
reported in this article.
Statistical Analysis
Primary and Secondary End Points
For the primary end point of progression-free survival, the cal-
culated sample size was 700 patients aimed to detect a haz-
ard ratio (HR) of 0.78 or less, with 80% power allowing for 10%
loss to follow-up and a 2-sided α = .05. Overall survival was a
powered secondary end point in the study (80% power; HR,
0.76; 2-sided α = .05). To avoid multiplicity, overall survival
was to be tested statistically only if the primary end point of
the study was met.
To allow for 2 analyses in the trial, the final type I error of
0.05 was split between the interim and final analyses based
on a standard α spending function (Lan and DeMets23,24). The
primary end point at the final analysis would be achieved if
progression-free survival was significantly longer in the
TTFields plus temozolomide group using a stratified log-
rank test (stratified by the randomization strata) with an α of
.046 (an α of 0.014 was spent on the interim analysis).
The secondary end point would be achieved at the final
analysisifoverallsurvivalwassignificantlylongerintheTTFields
plustemozolomidegroupusingastratifiedlog-ranktestwithan
α of .048 (an α of .006 was spent on the interim analysis).
Missing Data
For the analysis of progression-free survival patients were cen-
sored for progression when treatment was changed before evi-
dence of progression (at the date of treatment change), at the
date of their last MRI if lost to follow up, or upon reaching the
cutoff date without progression. For the analysis of overall sur-
vival, patients without a known date of death were censored
at the last known date they were documented to be alive.
Exploratory End Points
Theexploratoryendpointsofannualsurvivalratesandtherate
of progression-free survival at 6 months were compared be-
tween groups using a 1-sided Z distribution of the Kaplan-
Meier estimates of the survival rates at the defined time point.
In addition, the Cox proportional hazards model was used to
analyzebothprogression-freesurvivalandoverallsurvivalcon-
trolling for treatment group, age, sex, MGMT methylation sta-
tus (as determined by the central laboratory), tumor location
inthebrain,andcountryofresidence(UnitedStatesvsallother
countries). The threshold for significant interactions in the
model was specified at an α of .05.
Post Hoc Analysis
Post hoc analyses of prespecified subgroups (MGMT pro-
moter methylation status, extent of resection (complete, par-
tial resection, or biopsy), age (continuous), performance sta-
tus (90-100 vs ≤80), sex, and geographic region (United States
vs the rest of the world) was performed using a multivariate
analysistestingthedifferencebetweentreatmentgroupswhile
controlling for the other prognostic factors.
Analysis of Adverse Events and Tolerability
Differences in the incidence of adverse events between groups
was tested using a χ2 test at an α of .05. The incidence of ad-
verse events was also compared between groups after normal-
izingtheincidencetotheaveragetreatmentdurationpergroup.
Differences in the time to decline in Karnofsky performance
score and Mini-Mental State Examination were tested using a
log-rank test at an α of .05. All analyses were performed using

tients were included in the intent-to-treat analysis. Tumor tis-
sue for MGMT testing was available for 82% of the patients;
ofthecaseswithavalidtest(518of571)41%were MGMTmeth-
ylated (40% TTFields plus temozolomide group and 45% for
the temozolomide-only group). In 7% of tumors, expression
of the IDH1-R132H mutant was demonstrated by a positive
immunohistochemistry, EGFR was amplified in 40%.
Tumor location (lobe, hemisphere) in the brain was also
comparable between the groups. The median time from his-
tological diagnosis to randomization was 3.8 months (range,
1.7-6.2 months) for patients in the TTFields plus temozolo-
mide group, and 3.7 months (range, 1.4-6.3 months) for those
in the temozolomide-only group. Median time from the end
of radiotherapy to randomization was 37 days in the TTFields
plus temozolomide group and 36 days in the temozolomide-
only group and occurred in most patients after starting of the
first cycle of maintenance temozolomide. Median time from
randomization to TTFields was 5 days (IQR, 3-7 days).
Treatment Delivery

zolomide as per local practice. The median number of temozo-
lomide cycles until first tumor progression was 6 (range, 0-51)

of patients continued TTFields after the first progression.
Efficacy End points
After a median follow-up of 40 months (IQR, 34-66 months),
and a minimum follow-up of 24 months, the primary end point
of median progression-free survival was 6.7 months (95% CI,
6.1-8.1 months) for patients treated with TTFields plus temo-
zolomide vs 4.0 months (95% CI, 3.8-4.4 months) for patients
treated with temozolomide alone, for a proportional hazard
ratio (HR) of 0.63 (95% CI, 0.52-0.76; P < .001; stratified log-
ranktest;Figure2A).Forthesecondaryendpointofoverallsur-

 associated with a significant difference in survival (P = .101
and P = .183, respectively).
Post Hoc Subgroup Analysis
In post hoc analyses, TTFields plus temozolomide was asso-
ciated with an increase in progression-free survival and over-
all survival (Figure 3; Cox proportional hazards, P < .05 for the
treatment effect within each subgroup) in all subgroups of
patients regardless of age, sex, Karnofsky performance score,
MGMT promoter methylation status, geographic region, or
extent of resection. Patients 65 years or older had shorter sur-
vival than patients younger than 65 years. In both age groups,
TTFields plus temozolomide was associated with signifi-
cantly increased survival compared with temozolomide alone
for older (HR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.33-0.77) and younger patients
(HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.55-0.82; Figure 4A and Figure 4B).

 Patients with tumors that lacked MGMT promoter methyla-
tion had a significantly shorter survival than patients with
tumors with MGMT promoter methylation, although use of
TTFields with temozolomide was associated with longer
survival (HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.49-0.85 both in patients with
tumors that were MGMT methylated and tumors that were
unmethylated, respectively; Figure 4C and Figure 4D). In the
TTFields plus temozolomide group, 265 patients who were
treated with TTFields for 18 hours a day or more (monthly av-
erage in the first 6 months of treatment) had longer survival
than 185 patients treated less than 18 hours a day (22.6 months,
95% CI, 19.7-25.1 months vs 19.1 months, 95% CI, 16.5-21.9; HR,
0.65; 95% CI, 0.49-0.85; P = .009).

 activities of daily life and cognition were performed using the
Karnofsky performance score and the Mini-Mental State
Examination. Time to a sustained 6-point decline in the Mini-
Mental State Examination score was significantly longer in the
TTFields plus temozolomide group than the temozolomide-
alone group (16.7 months, 95% CI, 14.7-19.0 months vs 14.2
months, 95% CI, 12.7-17.0 months, respectively; HR, 0.79; 95%
CI, 0.66- 0.95; P = .01). Time to a sustained 10-point decrease
in Karnofsky performance score was also significantly longer
in the TTFields plus temozolomide group than in the temo-
zolomide-alone group (5.5 months;, 95% CI, 5.0-6.3 months
vs 3.9 months; 95% CI, 3.1-5.2 months, respectively; HR, 0.80;
95% CI, 0.67-0.95; P = .009).
Discussion
In the final analysis of this randomized phase 3 trial, the ad-
dition of the TTFields treatment to standard temozolomide
maintenance therapy, compared with standard temozolo-
mide maintenance therapy alone, resulted in increased pro-
gression-free survival and overall survival in patients with
newly diagnosed glioblastoma. After a median follow-up of 40
months, the addition of TTFields to temozolomide, com-
pared with temozolomide alone, resulted in longer median
progression-free survival from the time of randomization, 6.7
monthsvs4.0monthsandlongermedianoverallsurvivalfrom
randomization, 20.9 months vs 16.0 months, respectively.
These findings are consistent with the preliminary results re-
ported based on a planned interim analysis of the first 315
patients enrolled, after a median follow-up of 38 months, in
which median progression-free survival in the intent-to-
treat population was 7.1 months (95% CI, 5.9-8.2 months) in
the TTFields plus temozolomide group (210 patients
analyzed) and 4.0 months (95% CI, 3.3-5.2 months) in the
temozolomide-alone group (105 patients analyzed).
In the current study, exploratory end points were consis-
tent with the primary and secondary end points in this trial. In
aposthocanalysistheeffectofTTFieldswasobservedinallclini-
cal and molecular subgroups, including patients older than age
65 years and patients with MGMT unmethylated tumors.
To assess whether the improved outcome may have been
relatedtootherfactorsthantheTTFieldstherapythedatawere
scrutinized for possible imbalances, unexpected poor perfor-
mance of the control group, or differences in supportive care
administeredtopatientsbetweenthe2groups.Bothclinicalfac-
tors and molecular tumor characteristics were well balanced
and comparable between the 2 groups. MGMT promoter meth-
ylation, the strongest predictive factor for outcome in temozo-
lomide-treated patients,25 was more prevalent in the control
group(45%vs40%ofsampleswithavalidresult).Patientswith
early tumor progression occurring during the first 3 months
after diagnosis were not included in this trial, and so the ran-
domized patient population had a better prognosis, for both
groups, compared with other trials that had randomized pa-
tientsbeforeradiationtherapy.Thereportedsurvivaltimeswere
measured from randomization, not from diagnosis, so for an
estimation of the overall outcome 3.8 months should be added
inbothgroups.TheRTOG0525/Intergroupstudy,whichevalu-

In this trial, the rates of systemic adverse effects were not
significantly different in the 2 treatment groups. The occur-
rence of mild to moderate skin irritation related to reaction be-

These findings are in contrast to the more than 23

 (eg, dose-dense temozolomide, cilengitide, nimotuzumab,
bevacizumab, and rindopepimut3,5,8,26) for treatment of pa-
tients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma and have failed to
demonstrate improved survival. Innovative treatments for
glioblastoma are needed.
Limitations
This study has several limitations. First, the current trial was
open-label because it was considered practically unfeasible
(heat and easy measure of current associated with TTFields)
and ethically unacceptable to expose patients to a sham
device. Although a placebo effect may affect subjective end
points like quality of life or even progression-free survival by
influencing the frequency of imaging and its interpretation,
in the current trial a consistent benefit was observed in
progression-free survival as assessed by blinded central radi-
ology review, as well as in the gold standard of objective out-
come, overall survival. Second, delivery of TTFields therapy
requires the patient to continuously carry a device on a
shaved scalp and may create burdens for patients. Neverthe-
less, the majority of patients were able to handle the device
independently or with some help from a caregiver. The fact
that 75% of patients achieved treatment adherence of 75% or
more (ie, using the device for ≥18 hours per day) indicated
good tolerability. The effects of the TTFields treatment and
the need for continuous use of the device on quality of life
will be reported separately.
Conclusions
In the final analysis of this randomized clinical trial of
patients with glioblastoma who had received standard radio-
chemotherapy, the addition of TTFields to maintenance
temozolomide chemotherapy vs maintenance temozolo-
mide alone, resulted in statistically significant improvement
in progression-free survival and overall survival. These
results are consistent with the previous interim analysis.

 and decision to submit the manuscript for
publication. The study was designed by Drs Stupp
and Ram, together with representatives from
Novocure, mainly Dr Kirson. The study oversight
was supported and monitored by a clinical research
organization, which also held the database. Data
were collected by the investigators and monitored
by the clinical research organization. The data were
analyzed by Dr Steinberg, the independent study
statistician, and by Dr Lavy-Shahaf, the sponsor
statistician. Data interpretation was the
responsibility of Drs Stupp and Ram, with Dr Kirson,
the study sponsor representative and project lead,
all of whom jointly developed the first draft.
A subsequent mature draft and prefinal version
were circulated among all authors who gave
additional input, contributed to, and approved the
manuscript. Drs Stupp and Kirson reviewed all
patient profiles for consistency. The decision to
publish the data and its interpretation was made by
Drs Stupp and Ram and was supported by all
coauthors.
