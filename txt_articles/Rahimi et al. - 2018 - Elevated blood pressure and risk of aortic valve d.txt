Aims
To test two related hypotheses that elevated blood pressure (BP) is a risk factor for aortic valve stenosis (AS) or
regurgitation (AR).
...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
and results
In this cohort study of 5.4 million UK patients with no known cardiovascular disease or aortic valve disease at base-
line, we investigated the relationship between BP and risk of incident AS and AR using multivariable-adjusted Cox
regression models. Over a median follow-up of 9.2 years, 20 680 patients (0.38%) were diagnosed with AS and
6440 (0.12%) patients with AR. Systolic BP (SBP) was continuously related to the risk of AS and AR with no evi-
dence of a nadir down to 115 mmHg. Each 20 mmHg increment in SBP was associated with a 41% higher risk of
AS (hazard ratio 1.41, 95% confidence interval 1.38–1.45) and a 38% higher risk of AR (1.38, 1.31–1.45).
Associations were stronger in younger patients but with no strong evidence for interaction by gender or body
mass index. Each 10 mmHg increment in diastolic BP was associated with a 24% higher risk of AS (1.24, 1.19–1.29)
but not AR (1.04, 0.97–1.11). Each 15 mmHg increment in pulse pressure was associated with a 46% greater risk of
AS (1.46, 1.42–1.50) and a 53% higher risk of AR (1.53, 1.45–1.62).
...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Conclusion
Long-term exposure to elevated BP across its whole spectrum was associated with increased risk of AS and AR.
The possible causal nature of the observed associations warrants further investigation.

Introduction
Despite growing prevalence1,2 modifiable causes of aortic valve disease
(stenosis or regurgitation) are not well understood, and consequently,
there are no effective approaches to its prevention. Given the shared
pathways between several cardiovascular conditions, there has been
some interest in assessment of the effect of established cardiovascular
risk factors, such as elevated blood pressure (BP), on the risk of aortic
valve disease.3–5 Mechanistic evidence for the potential causal role of
BP comes from studies showing that hypertension causes abnormally
high tensile stress on aortic leaflets, which can lead to endothelial injury
or disruption.6,7 Supporting clinical evidence for the potential role of
elevated BP and risk of aortic valve disease comes from a few largely
cross-sectional studies that have reported a positive association be-
tween hypertension and risk of aortic stenosis (AS)8–10 or aortic
regurgitation (AR).11 However, to our knowledge, no large-scale

longitudinal analysis of these associations across the complete range of
typical BP levels has previously been reported.
We, therefore, aimed to investigate the relationship between BP
and the risk of aortic valve disease in a large contemporary popula-
tion, with the null hypotheses that systolic BP (SBP) is not associated
with future risk of AS or AR.
Methods
Data source
We used linked electronic health records from the UK Clinical Practice
Research Datalink (CPRD) from 1 January 1990 to 31 December 2015.
The CPRD database contains retrospective anonymised patient data
from 674 general practices in the UK.12 It links primary care records with
discharge diagnosis from secondary care (Hospital Episode Statistics), and
mortality data from national death registries (Office for National
Statistics). The dataset is considered the most comprehensive longitudin-
al primary care database with serial collection of information relating to
diagnosis, treatments, investigations and outcomes13 and has been vali-
dated for epidemiological research for a range of conditions, including
those heavily relying on imaging tests.12,14 Scientific approval for this study
was given by the CPRD Independent Scientific Advisory Committee
(ISAC). The CPRD Group has obtained ethics approval from a National
Research Ethics Service Committee for all purely observational research
using anonymised data from the CPRD.
Study population
A total of 6 613 644 patients between 30 and 90years with at least one BP
measurement were identified. Patients entered the study at the date of
their earliest blood pressure measurement (baseline) and exited the study
at the earliest date of transfer out of the general practice as recorded in the
database, death, end of the study period, or a record of aortic valve disease
(whatever came first). To reduce the risk of reverse causation, we further
excluded all individuals who, at baseline, had a prior diagnosis of cardiovas-
cular disease (414 250), AS or AR (9417), or those prescribed lipid-
lowering or anti-hypertensive medication (196 451). Cardiovascular disease
was defined, as previously reported15,16 using ICD 10 and Read codes as:
myocardial infarction, ischaemic heart disease, stroke, transient ischaemic
attack, heart failure, chronic kidney disease, peripheral arterial disease, atrial
fibrillation, or venous thromboembolism. We further excluded individuals
with extreme values of baseline SBP and diastolic BP (DBP) (outside the
range of 50–300mmHg and 50–200, respectively, 14 233 patients). Patients
with less than 1year follow-up (273 567) and those with their first BP meas-
urement before 1990 (313 543) were also excluded.
Outcomes and exposures
Our primary outcomes were incident reports of AS or AR, which were
identified from hospital discharge reports, death registers, or primary
care records, using the diagnostic codes shown in Supplementary mater-
ial online, Table S1. We excluded diagnostic codes that clearly classified
aortic valve disease as congenital, or when mixed aortic valve disease was
reported with no clear indication of the dominant condition. However,
we included reports of rheumatic heart disease in our main analysis due
to the clinical uncertainty in distinguishing between rheumatic and other
non-congenital types of aortic valve disease diagnosed at middle and old
age (but excluded these in a sensitivity analysis). Previous validation stud-
ies based on electronic health records have shown that the majority of
clinically recorded valve disease codes are based on echocardiographic
assessments and recorded cases typically represent moderate to severe
severity rating.17–19 However, for more direct validation of valve disease
and its severity in our study, three subgroup analyses were performed
(see section Statistical analyses).
We defined SBP as our primary exposure because SBP has been shown
to have the strongest predictive ability among most other measures of BP
for most cardiovascular outcomes.20,21 We further chose DBP and pulse
pressure (PP) (PP = SBPmmHg - DBPmmHg) as alternative exposure variables
to investigate any differential associations between BP indices on risk and to
enable comparison of our findings with epidemiological studies of BP associ-
ations with other outcomes. Blood pressure measurements were taken
from recordings in primary care records (not hospitals). To take account of
measurement errors resulting from variability in BP measurements over
longer time, we used multiple repeated BP measurements (mean of 6.7
measurements per patient) to calculate ‘regression dilution-corrected’ or
‘usual’ BP values.15,16,22,23 SBP, DBP, and PP were analysed as continuous
variables with 20mmHg, 10mmHg, and 15mmHg increments, respectively.
Systolic BP was further analysed as a categorical variable: <
_120mmHg;
121mmHg to 140mmHg; 141mmHg to 160mmHg; and >
_160mmHg.
Statistical analysis
We determined the association between SBP (and other BP indices) and
each outcome using multivariable Cox regression and displayed hazard
ratios (HRs) with floating absolute risks.24 We justified the proportional
hazards assumption of Cox models using log cumulative hazards plots.
Our primary analyses were adjusted for baseline sex, age, body mass index
(BMI, kg/m2), smoking status (not current, no, current), cholesterol (total,
LDL, HDL),25 year of the initial BP measurement as a categorical variable
(1990 to 1994, 1995 to 1999, 2000 to 2004, 2005 to 2009, and 2010 to
2013) to control for potential period effects, and stratified for practice-
level index of multiple deprivation (IMD) fifths. For BMI, smoking and lipids,
we utilized the most recent measurement within 2years of the baseline
SBP measurement. If no measurement was available within this timeframe,
we classified the covariate as missing. We performed subgroup analyses
and report interactions by age, sex and BMI groups. We imputed missing
baseline data using multiple imputation by expectation-maximization (EM)
algorithm with bootstrapping,26 generating five imputations.27
To investigate the validity of our outcome variables and potential effect
of valve severity on outcomes, we performed the following three sensitiv-
ity analyses. First, we extracted information on echocardiograms within
14days prior to the recorded diagnosis of valve disease and stratified anal-
yses by echocardiographically supported diagnoses of aortic valve disease
vs. other reports with no recorded information on diagnostic tools during
this 14-day interval. Second, we stratified our analyses according to
whether or not there was a definitive report of valve replacement to as-
sess whether observations might have been diluted due to inclusion of
mild or asymptomatic cases. Third, we stratified our analyses by initial
source of case reporting (hospital discharge vs. primary care), assuming
hospital diagnoses cases to be more severe and more likely to be verified
by specialists. In addition, we performed the following analyses to test the
validity of our findings. First, to test the validity of methods for measuring
and modelling exposure variables and co-variates, as well as the possibility
of informed presence bias (i.e. higher BP leading to more investigations
and detection of valve and other cardiovascular disease), we chose inci-
dent stroke as a positive control outcome and report BP associations with
stroke. Second, we excluded total cholesterol, LDL and HDL as covariates
from the primary analyses due to their high proportion of missing values.
Third, we assessed the impact of progressive covariate adjustment to as-
sess the robustness of our estimates to further adjustments.
Statistical significance threshold was defined as a two-sided P-value
<0.05. Study findings are reported in accordance with the REporting of
studies Conducted using Observational Routinely-collected health Data
(RECORD) recommendations.28 Statistical analyses were performed using
R, version 3.3 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).

Results
In total, 5 392 183 individuals with a median follow-up of 9.2 [inter-
quartile interval (IQI) 4.4–16] years and median age of 39 (IQI 32–53)
years were included in the study. Of these individuals, 27 977 (0.52%)
had a diagnosis of aortic valve disease (AS or AR). A total of 20 680
(0.38%) were diagnosed with only AS, and 6440 (0.12%) were
diagnosed with only AR and were included in the analyses. The mean
(standard deviation) age at the time of diagnosis were 64.2 (12.1)
years and 57.0 (16.5) years, for AS and AR, respectively. Patient char-
acteristics by SBP categories are shown in Table 1. Overall, 1.1% of
patients had diabetes at baseline and about a third were smokers.
The incidence of several vascular conditions during follow-up was
higher among those with higher SBP.

When SBP was analysed as a continuous variable across all age
groups, each 20 mmHg increment in SBP was associated with a 1.41
times higher risk of AS (HR 1.41, confidence interval (CI) 1.38–1.45)
(Figure 1A), and a 1.38 times higher risk of AR (HR 1.38, CI 1.31–1.45)
(Figure 1B) with no evidence of a threshold below or above which the
associations were different. Compared with the reference category
of SBP <
_120 mmHg, patients with SBP >
_161 mmHg were more than
twice as likely to be diagnosed with AS (HR 2.27, CI 2.12–2.43) and
about twice more likely to be diagnosed with AR (HR 1.96, CI 1.68–
2.29).
Adjusted hazard ratios among subgroups are shown in Figure 2.
For patients aged less than 50years, each 20 mmHg increment in SBP
was associated with a 1.80 times higher risk of AS (HR 1.80, CI 1.64–
1.96); whereas in patients aged 71–90 the risk was 1.23 times higher
(HR 1.23, CI 1.18–1.28) (Figure 2A). The corresponding hazard ratios
for AR were 1.86 (CI 1.66–2.07) in the youngest age group and 1.22
(CI 1.10–1.35) in the oldest age group (Figure 2B). Proportional differ-
ences did not differ between men and women or by BMI categories
for both AS and AR (Figure 2).
Associations were similar when echocardiographically-supported
reports were compared with reports without information on imaging
(P for heterogeneity 0.51 for AS and 0.07 for AR); when hospital dis-
charge reports were compared with outpatient diagnoses (P for het-
erogeneity 0.58 for AS and 0.13 for AR); or when patients with a
definitive report of valve replacement were compared with those
with no clear reports of valve replacement (P for heterogeneity 0.24
for AS and 0.26 for AR) (Figure 3).
Figure 4 shows the associations of PP and DBP with aortic valve dis-
ease. Each 15mmHg higher PP was associated with a 1.46 times
greater risk of AS (HR 1.46, CI 1.42–1.50), and a 1.53 times higher
risk of AR (HR 1.53, CI 1.45–1.62). Each 10mmHg higher DBP was
associated with a 1.24 times greater risk of AS (HR 1.24, CI 1.19–
1.29) but not significantly with AR (HR 1.04, CI 0.97–1.11). However,
associations differed by age group (Figure 4). In addition, when PP and
SBP were simultaneously entered into the models, the overall HR for
SBP was substantially attenuated for AS (HR 1.08, CI 1.05–1.10) and
was no longer significant for AR (HR 0.98, CI 0.94–1.03). In these SBP
adjusted models, for a given SBP, DBP was negatively associated with
AR or AS (Supplementary material online, Figure S1).

showed no evidence of bias towards extreme: overall each 20mmHg
increment in SBP was associated with a 1.34 times higher risk of
stroke (HR 1.34, CI 1.33–1.35) across all age groups. Removal of
cholesterol from the adjusted models had no material effect on the
finding either and progressive adjustment for covariates showed that
after adjustment for age, additional adjustments for covariates had lit-
tle impact on estimates.
Discussion
In a population of adults, there was a significant association between
higher SBP and increased risk of AS and AR. Proportional increases in
risk for a given difference in SBP were similar throughout the range of
SBP with no evidence of a threshold below or above which the rela-
tionship changed. Overall, a 20mmHg higher SBP was associated

multiple deprivation. AS, aortic stenosis; AR, aortic regurgitation; BMI, body mass index.

with an approximately 40% higher risk of AS or AR, with stronger
associations observed in younger groups.
A few cross-sectional studies have previously reported that
patients with hypertension also have a higher chance of concomitant
AS.8–10 One cohort study with 132 cases of AS found a positive asso-
ciation between systolic BP and AS.29 In one randomised trial of 100
patients with moderate or severe asymptomatic AS, those treated
with Ramipril have a slower rate of AS progression than those allo-
cated placebo.30 However, no large-scale randomised trial for pre-
vention of aortic valve disease with BP lowering treatment has been
reported. There are fewer reports of association of BP with AR, but
in one cross-sectional study a positive association was seen.11
Consequently, current guidelines for management of valvular heart
disease make no reference to strategies for prevention of AS or
AR.31 Similarly, hypertension guidelines do not report aortic valve
disease as a potential target for BP lowering treatment.32
To our knowledge, our study is the first longitudinal study with
enough power to reliably report on age-specific associations across the
whole spectrum of typical BP levels for both AS and AR. The continuous
log-linear relationships between SBP and risk of aortic valve disease
observed in our study are consistent with other large-scale epidemio-
logical studies that have examined associations with other vascular out-
comes.20,21,33,34 These findings collectively suggest that AS and AR might
be partially preventable with potential implications on clinical practice
guidelines for prevention of cardiovascular disease in general and valvular
heart disease and hypertension in particular.31,32,35
Previous clinical and experimental studies have suggested that
mechanical stress related to high BP plays an important role in

initiating the process of aortic valve sclerosis.36 Higher BP and pulse
pressure are associated with turbulent blood flow and shear stress.9
These mechanical forces contribute to endothelial cell damage and
changes in the extracellular matrix, which over time lead to loss of
distensibility of aorta and stiffening of the aortic valve. The ensuing
progressive leaflet and aortic wall changes, in turn, contribute to left
ventricular hypertrophy and further increase in SBP and PP, thus
accelerating the vicious cycle of elevated BP, left ventricular hyper-
trophy, arteriosclerosis and further structural and functional valve
damage.36–38
Whilst these interdependent processes have been mainly postu-
lated to explain the pathophysiology of AS, it is not entirely clear why
the same exposure, namely elevated BP, is more likely to lead to AR
in some patients and to AS in others. The age-specific associations in
the present study show that compared with AS, the absolute risk of
AR increased less strongly with age. Thus, one could speculate that
younger patients, who develop AR, have a higher predisposition for
aortopathy or a connective tissue disorder trait, and hence respond
to elevated BP and PP faster, leading to aortic root dilatation and
then AR. In contrast, people without such traits may predominantly
respond with arterial stiffening and aortic valve calcification over sev-
eral years that eventually manifests as AS. Future mechanistic studies
could explore the differences in BP pathways on AS and AR.
As an observational study, we are unable to entirely rule out un-
controlled confounding or reverse causality. Indeed, given the poten-
tial bidirectional relationship between aortic stiffness and elevated
BP,37 it is possible that elevated SBP and pulse pressure are markers
of an underlying arterial stiffness, which was not measured in our
study. Ongoing Mendelian randomization studies (http://www.ukbio
bank.ac.uk/2017/02/causes-and-consequences-of-valvular-heart-
disease/) that are less prone to reverse causality and confounding are
ideally suited to investigate the causal relationship of the observed
associations in this study. A further limitation of our study is that our
analyses were based on routinely collected data from linked electron-
ic health records, which might be more prone to measurement errors
of exposure and outcome variables. However, several steps were
undertaken to reduce the effect of such possible measurement errors
(e.g. regression dilution correction for our exposure variable) and to
validate our findings (e.g. stratification of aortic valve disease cases by
confirmed reports of echocardiograms or valve replacement and their
comparison with stroke as a positive control outcome). Finally, stud-
ies based on clinically reported events are more likely to only capture
functionally relevant and symptomatic disease states and are likely to
underestimate rates compared to epidemiological studies that screen
the entire population for subclinical and clinical disease. Thus, the
observed associations may not be generalizable to less severe and
subclinical cases of aortic valve disease.
Conclusion
In conclusion, we found significant associations between higher BP
and pulse pressure and increased risk of AS and AR. These findings
suggest that risk of aortic valve disease might be modifiable but fur-
ther research, ideally from meta-analyses of BP lowering trials or
Mendelian randomization studies are needed to assess the causal na-
ture of the observed associations.
