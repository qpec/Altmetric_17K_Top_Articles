A precision medicine approach to a patient
with unresolved pain following orthopedic
surgery: a case report
David Gazzaniga1, Ashley Brenton2* and Brian Meshkin2
Abstract
Background: Precision medicine is a promising technology in patient care that combines genetic analysis with
clinical data, such as health, behavioral, functional, environment, and lifestyle information. Here we present the
case of a 54-year old woman who, following an accident, had uncontrolled chronic pain and was subsequently
labeled a drug seeker.
Case presentation: A 54-year-old white woman who was experiencing severe calf pain was referred for treatment. Her
pain was insufficiently controlled immediately following knee arthroplasty with multiple opioid medications, as
well as non-opioids. Precision medicine testing was ordered for her so that we could assess her pain sensitivity
objectively to determine if the pill seeker designation was correct and to determine the best medications for
her.
Based on the Proove profiles, we determined that she had moderately low pain sensitivity, which means that
clinically she may underreport pain and may have decreased medication needs. This result suggested that her
continued reporting of unresolved pain was probably due to a condition unresolved by her right knee arthroplasty. In
addition, she was found to be at low risk of opioid addiction, based on the Proove Opioid Risk Profile. Taken together,
along with the high levels of pain she described, we determined that her pain was not properly controlled and
that the designation of pill seeker was incorrect. The next step was to determine which medications and which
doses would result in the most favorable outcomes for our patient. To determine this, we used the results of
the Proove Opioid Response, Proove Drug Metabolism, and Proove Non-Opioid Profiles to guide her treatment.
We reduced her pain medications to a single opioid, Vicodin (acetaminophen and hydrocodone), which also
eliminated the adverse side effects she experienced.
Conclusions: Precision medicine offers an important health care decision tool which can reduce emotional and physical
costs to patients and may reduce the economic health care burden of unnecessary surgeries and ineffective medication.
The information provided by these profiles can be used clinically to guide treatment decisions and evaluate patient pain.

Background
Precision medicine is a promising technology in patient
care that combines genetic analysis with clinical data,
such as health, behavioral, functional, environment, and
lifestyle information. Here we present the case of a 54-
year-old woman who, following an accident, had uncon-
trolled chronic pain and was subsequently labeled a drug
seeker. Precision medicine testing revealed that she was
at low risk of opioid use disorder, had a moderately low
pain sensitivity score, and had a genotype that was
incompatible with favorable response to her current
medications. Following treatment changes guided by the
results of the precision medicine profiles, her previously
uncontrolled pain resolved and her function and quality
of life improved.

 Case presentation
A 54-year-old white woman who was experiencing severe
calf pain was referred for treatment. She had undergone a
right knee arthroplasty following initial complaints of leg
pain in December 2015. Following surgery, she expe-
rienced excruciating pain, as well as pain in the pos-
terolateral aspect of her knee and some neurological
sensation of numbness and weakness. The pain was
insufficiently controlled immediately following surgery
with OxyContin (oxycodone) 10 mg and two tablets of
Percocet (acetaminophen and oxycodone) 10/325 mg in
the morning, one to two Percocets (acetaminophen and
oxycodone) at 3 p.m., one Percocet (acetaminophen and
oxycodone) at 7 p.m., one to two Percocets (acetamino-
phen and oxycodone) at bedtime, as well as OxyContin
(oxycodone), Norco (acetaminophen and hydrocodone),
Vicodin (acetaminophen and hydrocodone), and MS
Contin (morphine sulfate). To combat opioid-induced side
effects, she was prescribed Movantik (naloxegol) for con-
stipation and Zofran (ondansetron) for nausea. In addition
to the listed medications, she was also prescribed Robaxin
(methocarbamol),
DILT-CD
(diltiazem
hydrochloride),
fluticasone propionate, furosemide, tizanidine hydrogen
chloride (HCL), and Xanax (alprazolam). She was unable
to put any weight on her leg. The treating medical team
felt that she was exaggerating her pain, which she rated as
an 8 on a numerical rating 10-point scale and refused her
requests for additional pain relief. She was discharged
3 days after surgery. Following her continued requests for
pain relief medication, she was labeled a “drug seeker” and
was referred to a pain management clinic. She states that
she felt embarrassment and humiliation.
At the end of January 2016, she was examined by the
first author, as a new treating physician. We ordered
precision medicine testing from Proove Biosciences, Inc.
(Irvine, CA, USA) to objectively gain insights into her:
(1) pain sensitivity, (2) drug-metabolizing enzyme geno-
types which may affect dose or adverse event profiles,
(3) risk for opioid use disorder, and (4) likelihood of
response to the most commonly prescribed opioid and
non-opioid pain medications.
Based on the Proove profiles, we determined that she
had moderately low pain sensitivity, which means that
clinically she may underreport pain and may have
decreased medication needs. This result suggested that
her continued reporting of unresolved pain was probably
due to a condition unresolved by the right knee arthro-
plasty. In addition, she was found to be at low risk of
opioid addiction, based on the Proove Opioid Risk
Profile. Taken together, along with the high levels of pain
she described, we determined that her pain was not
properly controlled and that the designation of pill
seeker was incorrect. The next step was to determine
which medications and which doses would result in the
most favorable outcomes for our patient. To determine
this, we used the results of the Proove Opioid Response,
Proove Drug Metabolism, and Proove Non-Opioid Pro-
files to guide her treatment. We reduced her pain medi-
cations to a single opioid, Vicodin (acetaminophen and
hydrocodone), which also eliminated the adverse side
effects that she had experienced. This treatment, guided
by the Proove profile, provided the necessary analgesia.
However, the medication still did not resolve the under-
lying issue.
Beyond medication management, the precision medi-
cine profile illustrated that she must have a remaining
injury or musculoskeletal damage causing the uncon-
trolled pain even after her right knee arthroplasty. On
further examination, we found an exostosis and hetero-
topic ossification of her popliteus muscle. This was
surgically removed by a posterolateral approach to the
proximal tibia. Following this surgery, her pain was sub-
stantially better than it was after her knee arthroplasty.
Discussion
The Proove precision medicine profiles combine genetic
risk factors with other clinical variables in proprietary
algorithms to provide information on patient pain sensi-
tivity, disease risk, medication response, and risk of sub-
stance use disorder.
Precision medicine provides physicians with a tool to
optimize patient treatment, as well as providing objective
information about a patient’s pain perception. Other mea-
sures of pain perception are generally subjective and self-
reported by the patient, using a pain rating scale (Numeric
Rating Scale or Visual Analog Scale) or through the Brief
Pain Inventory [1] or McGill Pain Questionnaire [2, 3]. In
contrast, objective information, such as that provided by
the Proove Pain Perception Profile, provides physicians
with evidence-based measures of pain perception to in-
form their treatment decisions.
Genetic testing is routinely used in cardiology [4],
oncology [5], and hematology [6] and the field of pharma-
cogenetics is increasingly recognized as an important part
of emerging precision medicine efforts [7]. In fact, the
implications of genetic variation on medications used
in pain management are well established in the litera-
ture [8, 9]. In this case, our patient’s medications prior
to genetic testing were unable to control her pain and,
following testing, a reduction in the number of medica-
tions and targeted treatment resulted in satisfactory
analgesia for the first time since the initial injury, with-
out the polypharmacy-related adverse drug events.
Conclusions
Precision medicine offers an important health care decision
tool which can reduce emotional and physical costs to
patients and may reduce the economic health care burden

 of unnecessary surgeries and ineffective medication. The
information provided by these profiles can be used clinically
to guide treatment decisions and evaluate patient pain.
