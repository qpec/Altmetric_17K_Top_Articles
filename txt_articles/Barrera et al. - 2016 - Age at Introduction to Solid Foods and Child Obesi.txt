Abstract
Background—Epidemiological evidence suggests that timing of introduction of solid foods may 
be associated with subsequent obesity, and the association may vary by whether an infant is 
breastfed or formula-fed.
Methods—We included 1181 infants who participated in the Infant Feeding Practices Study II 
(IFPS II) and the Year 6 Follow Up (Y6FU) study. Data from IFPS II were used to calculate the 
primary exposure and timing of solid food introduction (<4, 4–<6, and ≥6 months), and data from 
Y6FU were used to calculate the primary outcome and obesity at 6 years of age (BMI ≥95th 
percentile). We used multivariable logistic regression to assess the association between timing of 
the introduction of solids and obesity at 6 years and test whether this association was modified by 
breastfeeding duration (breastfed for 4 months vs. not).
Results—Prevalence of obesity in our sample was 12.0%. The odds of obesity was higher among 
infants introduced to solids <4 months compared to those introduced at 4–<6 months (odds ratio 
[OR] = 1.66; 95% CI, 1.15, 2.40) in unadjusted analysis; however, this relationship was no longer 
significant after adjustment for covariates (OR = 1.18; 95% CI, 0.79, 1.77). Introduction of solids 
≥6 months was not associated with obesity. We found no interaction between breastfeeding 
duration and early solid food introduction and subsequent obesity.
Conclusions—Timing of introduction of solid foods was not associated with child obesity at 6 
years in this sample. Given the inconsistency in findings with other studies, further studies in 
larger populations may be needed.
Introduction
In the United States, more than 8% of 2- to 5-year-olds and 17% of 6- to 11-year-olds have 
obesity.1 Children with obesity are more likely to have elevated cholesterol and blood 
pressure levels, breathing and joint problems, and are more likely to become adults with 
obesity.2,3 Multiple factors contribute to development of childhood obesity,3 and though no 
single factor explains all obesity, understanding which factors may play a role has important 
public health implications.

 Early infancy, particularly early nutrition, has been identified as a critical period for 
preventive strategies aimed at decreasing rates of obesity.4 One strategy that has been 
identified is increasing adherence to guidelines regarding timing of the introduction of solid 
foods. In previous analyses of the Infant Feeding Practices Study II (IFPS II), we found that 
40% of infants in our sample were introduced to solid foods before 4 months of age.5 
Although there has been inconsistency in recent years regarding recommendations on 
whether complementary foods should be introduced between 4 and 6 months,6,7 or not until 
6 months,8–10 most groups agree that introduction to solid foods before 4 months is too 
early.6–8,10
A review of 26 studies concluded that introduction of solids ≤4 months is associated with 
obesity, particularly among formula-fed infants.11 However, of the studies reviewed, the 
researchers concluded that few were large, good-quality studies. Additionally, some studies 
suggest that the association may differ for breastfed versus formula-fed infants.11,12 Thus, 
our aim, using data from a cohort of US children followed longitudinally throughout the first 
year of life, and contacted again at 6 years, was to assess how early introduction of solid 
foods (before 4 months) was associated with obesity at 6 years of age, and test for an 
interaction with breastfeeding status, controlling for multiple potential infant, child, and 
maternal confounders.
Methods
The IFPS II, conducted from 2005 to 2007, followed mothers from their third trimester of 
pregnancy through their infant’s first year. Infants born before 35 weeks, weighing less than 
5 pounds (lbs), who were a non-singleton, or with medical conditions that would affect 
feeding were not eligible to participate. A cross-sectional Year 6 Follow Up study (Y6FU) 
was conducted in 2012 when infants from the original study were approximately 6 years old. 
Among eligible IFPS II participants (completed the neonatal questionnaire and not 
subsequently disqualified from IFPS II),13 1542 completed the Y6FU (response rate of 
52%). Detailed methodology of Y6FU, including comparison of respondents to 
nonrespondents and to a nationally representative sample, are presented in a previously 
published methods article.13 Generally, participants of Y6FU were more likely to be white, 
higher educated, and married compared to a national sample.13
Child Obesity
With the Y6FU questionnaire, mothers were sent a measuring tape and instructions on how 
to measure their child’s height. They were asked to report this measure in inches, as well as 
to weigh their child on a scale without shoes and report the child’s weight in lbs; these 
measures were used to calculate z-scores of BMI (kg/m2). Child obesity was defined as age- 
and sex-specific BMI ≥95th percentile according to the 2000 CDC growth charts.14
Infant Feeding
IFPS II included approximately monthly postnatal questionnaires that each included a food 
frequency chart asking about the infant’s intake within the previous 7 days. We calculated 
age at introduction to solid foods as the midpoint between the child’s age when the mother

 reported no solid food consumption and when she first reported that her child had consumed 
solid foods in the previous 7 days. Solid foods included dairy foods other than milk (e.g., 
yogurt, cheese, and ice cream); soy foods other than soy milk (e.g., tofu, frozen soy 
desserts); baby cereal; other cereals and starches (e.g., breakfast cereals, teething biscuits, 
crackers, pasta, and rice); fruits; vegetables; french fries; meat, chicken, or combination 
dinners; fish or shellfish; peanut butter, other peanut foods, or nuts; eggs; and sweet foods 
(e.g., candy, cookies, and cake). Timing of introduction to solids was grouped into three 
categories: <4, 4–<6, and ≥6 months.
During IFPS II, when mothers indicated they were no longer breastfeeding, they were asked 
how old their infant was when they completely stopped breastfeeding or pumping milk; 
these data were used to categorize breastfeeding duration. We categorized infant feeding as 
those who received breastmilk for 4 or more months or not (never breastfed or stopped 
breastfeeding before 4 months).
Covariates
Maternal characteristics from the baseline IFPS II study included age (18–24, 25–29, 30–34, 
or ≥35 years), race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, or other), 
education (≤high school, 1–3 years of college, or college), poverty-income ratio (PIR; 
<185%, 185–349%, or ≥350%), prepregnancy BMI (<18.5, 18.5–24.9, 25.0–29.9, or ≥30.0 
kg/m2), marital status (married, not married), and parity (primiparous, multiparous). Infant 
characteristics included sex, birth weight (<4000, ≥4000 g), and gestational age (<37, ≥37 
weeks). Child characteristics included daily frequency of consumption of water, fruits, 
vegetables, and sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) at 6 years.
Analytic Sample and Statistical Analysis
Data on BMI at 6 years were available for 1408 participants, of which 11 were excluded for 
having biologically implausible values (<–4 standard deviations from the median BMI-for-
age15; the maximum BMI-for-age in our sample was 3.4, so no participants were excluded 
for high values). Data were missing on timing of introduction of solid foods for 89 
participants, and 168 were missing data on covariates. Data were missing for more than one 
variable for some participants, giving a final analytic sample of 1181. Infant characteristics 
and prevalence of child obesity were similar among those included versus excluded from 
analysis. Mothers of children included in the analysis were more likely to breastfeed longer, 
not introduce solid foods before 4 months, be white, have higher income, be married, be 
multiparous, have at least a college degree, and have lower prepregnancy BMI, compared to 
those excluded from the analysis.
We calculated prevalence of obesity at 6 years by maternal and infant characteristics and 
used a chi-square test to assess group differences. We used unadjusted and multivariable 
logistic regression to assess whether timing of introduction of solid foods was associated 
with obesity at 6 years and test for an interaction to see whether the association between 
early solid food introduction and subsequent obesity varied by breastfeeding status. We first 
adjusted for maternal characteristics, including maternal age, race, education, PIR, 
prepregnancy BMI, marital status, and parity, and infant characteristics, including sex, birth

 weight, and gestational age. In a third model, we adjusted for the previously mentioned 
covariates as well as child characteristics, including daily consumption of water, fruits, 
vegetables, and SSBs. For timing of solid introduction, we used a chi-square test to assess 
group differences. All analyses were conducted using SAS software (version 9.3; SAS 
Institute Inc., Cary, NC).
Results
Overall prevalence of obesity in our sample at 6 years was 12.0% (Table 1) and varied by 
maternal race/ethnicity, education, PIR, prepregnancy BMI, marital status, and infant’s birth 
weight.
The relationship between timing of introduction of solid foods and obesity at 6 years 
differed significantly between those introduced before 4 months and those introduced at 4–
<6 months (15.4% vs. 9.9%; p = 0.007), but not between those introduced at 4–<6 months 
and those introduced at 6 months or older (Fig. 1).
Odds of obesity at 6 years, by timing of introduction of solid foods during infancy, is shown 
in Table 2. Compared to infants who first received solid foods at 4–<6 months of age, infants 
introduced to solids before 4 months had increased odds of obesity at 6 years (odds ratio 
[OR] = 1.66; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.15, 2.40) in unadjusted analysis; however, this 
association was no longer present after adjusting for covariates (OR = 1.18; 95% CI, 0.79, 
1.77). Compared to infants introduced to solid foods at 4–<6 months, those introduced to 
solid foods at 6 months or older did not have different odds of obesity in the unadjusted or 
adjusted analysis. In the full model, interaction between timing of introduction of solid foods 
and breastfeeding duration was not significant (p = 0.2); as such, we did not included it in 
subsequent analyses.
Discussion
Findings regarding the association between timing of introduction of solid foods and 
subsequent obesity have been inconsistent, with some evidence suggesting that the 
association between timing of solid food introduction and subsequent obesity may differ for 
breastfed and formula-fed infants.11 One explanation for why studies may have found an 
association between timing of introduction of solids and subsequent obesity among formula-
fed, but not breastfed, infants is that infants fed at the breast are better able to self-regulate 
their intake in response to solid foods being added to their diet by decreasing their 
consumption of human milk.16 In contrast, solid foods given to formula-fed infants may be 
additive, rather than substitutive, potentially because infants fed from a bottle are more 
dependent on the caregiver’s input, which is likely influenced by external cues, such as 
feeding until the bottle is empty.17
Despite this possible mechanism, in our sample, we did not find an interaction between 
breastfeeding status and timing of solid food introduction and subsequent obesity, nor did 
we find an association between timing of solid food introduction and subsequent obesity 
when breastfeeding status was not taken into account.

 Findings of an association between early introduction to solids and childhood obesity are 
difficult to determine, given that when solid foods are introduced is inextricably linked to 
exclusive breastfeeding duration and formula feeding; therefore, residual confounding 
cannot be ruled out.11 Inconsistent with our findings, Huh and colleagues found a 6-fold 
increase in odds of obesity at 3 years among those breastfed less than 4 months and 
introduced to solids before 4 months, but not among those breastfed longer.12 The 
differences found among studies regarding the influence of breastfeeding status on timing 
and subsequent obesity may be linked to variations in study design, categorizations of infant 
feeding, and definitions of terms such as “starting solids.”11
Limitations of our study include that the sample population is not nationally representative. 
Additionally, child obesity at 6 years of age was based on measurements of height and 
weight taken by the mother, which may be susceptible to measurement error. In the National 
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2011–2012, which assesses measured height and 
weight, prevalence of obesity was 8.4% among 2- to 5-year-olds and 17.7% among 6- to 11-
year-olds, which is generally consistent with our estimate. The major strength of this 
analysis was the ability to control for many sociodemographic and dietary factors that have 
often not been controlled for in other studies. Additionally, information on timing of 
introduction of solid foods and breastfeeding duration were calculated from approximately 
monthly recalls assessed throughout infancy, limiting recall bias that may occur when asking 
about these practices when the child is older.
Conclusions
In this study, we did not find a significant association between timing of introduction of 
solid foods and child obesity at 6 years of age. Despite our findings, optimal infant feeding 
practices, including exclusive breastfeeding for approximately the first 6 months, timely 
introduction of complementary foods, and continued breastfeeding for at least the first 
year,18 should be promoted and supported for all infants because of the numerous health 
benefits for infants and mothers.19–21
