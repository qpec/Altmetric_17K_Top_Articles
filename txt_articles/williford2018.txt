IMPORTANCE Prior studies demonstrate a high prevalence of burnout and depression among
surgeons. Limited data exist regarding how these conditions are perceived by the surgical
community.
OBJECTIVES To measure prevalence of burnout and depression among general surgery
trainees and to characterize how residents and attendings perceive these conditions.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This cross-sectional study used unique, anonymous
surveys for residents and attendings that were administered via a web-based platform from
November 1, 2016, through March 31, 2017. All residents and attendings in the 6 general
surgery training programs in North Carolina were invited to participate.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The prevalence of burnout and depression among residents
was assessed using validated tools. Burnout was defined by high emotional exhaustion or
depersonalization on the Maslach Burnout Inventory. Depression was defined by a score of 10
or greater on the Patient Health Questionnaire–9. Linear and logistic regression models were
used to assess predictive factors for burnout and depression. Residents’and attendings’
perceptions of these conditions were analyzed for significant similarities and differences.
RESULTS In this study, a total of 92 residents and 55 attendings responded. Fifty-eight of 77
residents with complete responses (75%) met criteria for burnout, and 30 of 76 (39%) met
criteria for depression. Of those with burnout, 28 of 58 (48%) were at elevated risk of
depression (P = .03). Nine of 77 residents (12%) had suicidal ideation in the past 2 weeks.
Most residents (40 of 76 [53%]) correctly estimated that more than 50% of residents had
burnout, whereas only 13 of 56 attendings (23%) correctly estimated this prevalence
(P < .001). Forty-two of 83 residents (51%) and 42 of 56 attendings (75%) underestimated
the true prevalence of depression (P = .002). Sixty-six of 73 residents (90%) and 40 of 51
attendings (78%) identified the same top 3 barriers to seeking care for burnout: inability to
take time off to seek treatment, avoidance or denial of the problem, and negative stigma
toward those seeking care.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The prevalence of burnout and depression was high among
general surgery residents in this study. Attendings and residents underestimated the
prevalence of these conditions but acknowledged common barriers to seeking care.
Discrepancies in actual and perceived levels of burnout and depression may hinder wellness
interventions. Increasing understanding of these perceptions offers an opportunity to
develop practical solutions.

ost US physicians experience burnout, a syndrome
in which emotional depletion and maladaptive de-
tachment develop in response to prolonged occupa-
tional stress.1 Burnout appears to increase the risk of psychi-
atric conditions, including depression, anxiety, posttraumatic
stress disorder, and suicidality.2 Thus, burnout among physi-
cianshasgarneredwidespreadattentionwithinthehealthcare
sector and is considered by many to be a developing public
health concern.3
Burnout has increased since its recognition in the 1970s.3
Inastudyofmorethan6000USphysiciansfrom2011to2014,3
the prevalence of burnout increased from 45% to 54%. Sur-
geons appear to be particularly vulnerable, with the propor-
tion affected exceeding the national average for physicians.4
Surgical residency may represent a time of elevated risk, given
the significant duty hours, patient care demands, and chronic
sleep deprivation. In 2 recent national studies,4,5 the preva-
lence of burnout among surgical residents was 69%, which ex-
ceeds the rate for residents in nonsurgical specialties.
Most studies addressing burnout and depression among
surgeons have focused on prevalence. However, developing
effective solutions to reduce burnout and depression among
surgeons requires a deeper understanding of perceptions, risk
factors, and barriers to seeking treatment. Until these data are
available, efforts to reduce burnout and depression will be in-
sufficient.
The aims of this study were 2-fold. First, we sought to es-
tablish the prevalence of burnout and depression among sur-
gery trainees across the state of North Carolina. Second, we
aimedtocharacterizehowresidentandattendingsurgeonsper-
ceive burnout and depression to identify potential barriers to
seeking care that may be amenable to change.
Methods
Participants and Surveys
All residents and faculty members of the general surgery train-
ing programs at Carolinas Medical Center, Charlotte,
Duke University, Durham, East Carolina Brody School of
Medicine, Greenville, New Hanover Regional Medical Center,
Wilmington, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and
Wake Forest University, Winston-Salem, in North Carolina,
were identified as potential participants. At each institution,
thegeneralsurgeryprogramdirectorwasaskedtocontactthese
individualsviaemailtorequestparticipation.Involvementwas
voluntary, and no incentives were offered. Surveys were com-
pleted from November 1, 2016, to March 31, 2017. This study
was approved by the institutional review board of the Univer-
sity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, which did not require in-
formed consent for this anonymized survey.
Unique electronic surveys were created for residents and
attendingsusingQualtricssurveysoftware(QualtricsLLC).The
36-question resident survey used validated tools to identify
and characterize burnout (Maslach Burnout Inventory [MBI])6
and the risk of major depressive disorder (Patient Health Ques-
tionnaire–9 Depression Screen [PHQ-9]; possible scores range
from 0-27, with higher scores indicating severe risk of
depression).7 Burnout was defined as a high emotional ex-
haustion (possible scores range from 0-54, with higher scores
indicating higher degrees of emotional exhaustion) or deper-
sonalization (possible scores range from 0-30, with higher
scores indicating higher degrees of depersonalization) score
according to the MBI. We did not use the personal achieve-
mentscore(possiblescoresrangefrom0-48,withhigherscores
indicating higher degrees of personal achievement) as a cri-
terion because this score has not been used in previous
studies.8 The attending survey did not assess for burnout or
depression among attendings but instead focused on their per-
ceptions of these conditions among their residents. Both sur-
veys included questions regarding potential causative fac-
tors for burnout and depression and barriers to seeking care.
Given the small size of individual training programs and
the stigma associated with burnout and depression, surveys
were administered anonymously. With the exception of level
of training, we did not collect data that could be used to iden-
tify residents and attendings such as age or sex. We believed

riskofdeductivedisclosure,therebyleadingparticipantstoan-
swer survey questions more truthfully.
Statistical Analysis
Descriptive statistics were calculated (means and SDs for con-
tinuous variables and counts and proportions for categorical
variables) for the outcomes of the emotional exhaustion score,
depersonalization score, personal achievement score, burn-
out,PHQ-9score,andsuicidalideationamongresidents.Inad-
dition, descriptive statistics were calculated for covariates, in-
cluding familiarity with burnout syndrome, any weekly
physical activity, involvement in meaningful activities out-
side the hospital, and mean number of hours worked per week
(in the hospital and at home). Linear regression models were
used to assess the association of covariates with the continu-
ousoutcomesofemotionalexhaustion,depersonalization,per-
sonalachievement,andPHQ-9scores.Logisticregressionmod-
els were used to assess the association of covariates with the
outcomes of high emotional exhaustion, high depersonaliza-
tion, low personal achievement, burnout, depression, and sui-
cidal ideation. In all models, covariates were screened for uni-
Key Points
Questions What is the prevalence of burnout and depression
among general surgery trainees in North Carolina, and do
residents’and attendings’perceptions of these conditions differ?
Findings In this cross-sectional survey of 92 general residents and
55 attendings, the prevalence of burnout and risk of depression
among general surgery residents were high (58 of 77 [75%] and
30 of 76 [39%], respectively). Residents and faculty members
significantly underestimated the prevalence of burnout and
depression but identified the same barriers to seeking treatment.
Meaning Discrepancies exist in actual and perceived levels of
burnout and depression among residents and attendings, but a
common understanding of barriers to care provides an
opportunity for the development of practical interventions.

 variate correlation with the outcome of interest, and only
covariates with a significant correlation were included.
To compare median scores on Likert scales, Mann-
Whitney tests were used to identify differences between resi-
dent and attending physician responses. Comparisons be-
tween resident and attending physician responses to binary
questions were made using 2-proportion z tests or Fisher ex-
act test when appropriate. In all analyses, P < .05 was used to
assess statistical significance. All analyses were performed
using R software (R, version 3.2.2; R Core Team).9
Results
Demographics
A total of 158 general surgery residents were invited to par-
ticipate, with 92 (58.2%) responding. A total of 137 attending
surgeons were invited to participate, with 55 (40.1%) respond-
ing. These response rates are significantly higher than those
for larger studies on burnout recently published in the litera-
ture (8.6%-19.2%).3-5 Fifteen residents (16% of resident re-
spondents) did not complete the MBI or PHQ-9 portions of the
survey and thus were excluded from analyses of these out-
comes. One resident completed the MBI portion but not the
PHQ-9 portion and was thus excluded from analyses of PHQ-9
and suicidal ideation.
Primary Outcomes
Fifty-eightresidents(75%)metcriteriaforburnout.Median(in-
terquartile range [IQR]) personal achievement score was 37
(33-41); median (IQR) emotional exhaustion score, 31
(23-40); and median (IQR) depersonalization score, 15 (11-21).
Forty-two residents (55%) had high emotional exhaustion and
high depersonalization scores. Significant associations were
revealed between high emotional exhaustion and high dep-
ersonalization scores (42 of 77 residents [55%]; P < .001) and
high emotional exhaustion and low personal achievement
scores (37 of 77 residents [48%]; P = .005). Further classifica-
tion of dimensions of burnout according to the MBI appears
in Table 1.
Thirtyof76residents(39%)whocompletedthePHQ-9por-
tion of the survey had a PHQ-9 score of 10 or greater, consis-
tent with moderate to severe risk of depression. Median PHQ-9
score was 8, with an IQR of 4 to 11, consistent with mild de-
pression. Nine of 77 residents (12%) endorsed suicidal ide-
ation within the 2 weeks before completing the survey. Fur-
ther representation of PHQ-9 scores is found in Table 2.
Burnout was associated with a 6-point increase in
PHQ-9 score (coefficient [SE], 6.08 [1.41]; P < .001). Twenty-
eight of 58 residents (48%) with burnout also met criteria
for depression (P = .03). We found no significant association
between burnout and suicidal ideation (9 residents with sui-
cidal ideation and burnout, 49 with burnout only, 0 with
suicidal ideation only, and 18 with no suicidal ideation or
burnout; P = .11), although all residents acknowledging sui-
cidal ideation met criteria for burnout and depression. We
found no association between level of training and burnout,
depression, or suicidality.
Secondary Outcomes
Eighty-five of 90 residents (94%) and 55 of 57 attendings (96%)
were familiar with burnout (P = .71). Sixty-one of 87 residents
(70%) and 41 of 56 attendings (73%) agreed or strongly agreed
thatburnoutisalegitimatemedicalcondition(P = .69).Twelve
of 83 residents (14%) incorrectly believed that burnout is a re-
portable condition to the North Carolina State Medical Board.
Sixty-one of 83 residents (73%) were aware of resources avail-
able for physicians experiencing burnout, whereas only 32 of
55 attendings (58%) were aware of resources (P = .09).
Residents were asked to rank 10 causative factors of
burnout identified by previous studies based on the level of
frustration that they caused.8 Thirty-nine of 82 residents
(48%) identified lack of time to exercise, for self-care, and
for doing things that they enjoy as most frustrating. Eleven
of 82 (13%) identified conflicting responsibilities among
work, home, and family, and 11 of 82 (13%) identified feeling
underappreciated.
Forty-one of 73 residents (56%) identified the top barrier
to seeking care for burnout as inability to take time off from
work to seek treatment; 19 of 73 (26%) identified ambiva-
lence,avoidance,and/ordenialoftheproblem;and6of73(8%)
identified negative stigma. Among attending surgeons, 15 of
51 (29%) identified ambivalence, avoidance, and/or denial as
the top barrier to seeking care; 13 of 51 (25%) identified nega-
tive stigma; and 12 of 51 (24%) identified inability to take time
off from work to seek treatment. Further reporting of per-
ceived top barriers to seeking care for burnout is given in
Table 3.
Most residents (40 of 76 [53%]) correctly estimated that
more than 50% of residents were at high risk of burnout,
whereas only 13 of 56 attendings (23%) correctly estimated this
prevalence. The median resident believed that attendings

derestimated the true prevalence of residents at elevated risk
of depression (P = .002). The Figure represents resident and
attending perceptions of burnout and depression.
We used linear regression models to analyze the asso-
ciation of covariates with emotional exhaustion, deperson-
alization, personal achievement, and PHQ-9 scores. Resi-
dents participating in any physical activity on a weekly basis
had a 5.7-point decrease in emotional exhaustion score
(coefficient [SE], 5.70 [2.69]; P = .04). Residents involved in
activities that they believe to be meaningful outside of the
hospital scored 5.0 points lower on the PHQ-9 (coefficient
[SE], −5.01 [1.28]; P < .001).
We used logistic regression models to analyze the asso-
ciation of covariates with high emotional exhaustion and
depersonalization scores. The mean number of hours
worked per week was associated with increased odds of
high depersonalization (odds ratio, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.10-1.09;
P = .02). Every additional 10 hours worked per week was
estimated to be associated with increased odds of high dep-
ersonalization by a factor of 1.53 (95% CI, 1.10-2.34).
Discussion
The well-being of surgeons and other health care profes-
sionals is essential for a high functioning health care sys-
tem. Burnout and depression can harm surgeons and
patients. Previous studies have established an association
between burnout and medical error, reduced levels of
empathy, and early departure from the workforce.10 Given
the potential of burnout to hinder the delivery of care, the
wellness of physicians has become a discrete goal within the
larger mission to improve the quality of US health care.11
Prevalence of Resident Burnout, Depression,
and Suicidal Ideation
The prevalence of burnout among surgical residents in our
study(75%)ishigherthanrecentlypublishedestimatesofburn-
out among general surgery residents (69%) and all US physi-
cians (54%).3-5 Of note, our resident survey response rate of
58.2% is significantly higher than the response rates in these
other studies.3-5 Thus, our study data may more accurately re-
flect the prevalence of burnout among surgery residents.
Based on their PHQ-9 score, 40% of residents in our study
were at risk of moderate to severe depression. Compara-
tively, a 2015 systematic review and meta-analysis including
9447 US resident physicians2 found that 20.9% of individu-
als were at risk of depression. Our study is consistent with a
growing body of literature that suggests a higher prevalence
of depression among physicians compared with the general
population, which is estimated to be 7.6% for Americans 12
years and older.12
Physician suicide has gained national attention during the
past several years. An estimated 300 to 400 physicians die by
suicide each year.13 In 2008, a cross-sectional survey14 found
the prevalence of suicidal ideation among US surgeons to be
6.3%.From2000to2014,suicidewasthesecondleadingcause
of death for resident physicians.13 In our study, 12% of resi-
dents endorsed suicidal ideation in the 2 weeks preceding the
survey.
Perceptions of Burnout and Depression
Our study compared perceptions of burnout and depression
between residents and attending surgeons. Given the consid-
erable harms related to burnout and depression, it is critical
forattendingphysicians,particularlythoseparticipatinginresi-
dent education, to learn to identify residents with these con-
ditions accurately. Our data suggest that attendings perceive
fewer cases of burnout and depression among residents than
are present. We consider the following 3 potential reasons for
this discrepancy: (1) attendings may be unfamiliar with the
signs and symptoms of burnout and depression in residents,
(2) attendings may perceive the signs and symptoms of these
conditions as normal within the surgical culture, and (3) resi-

 dents may conceal burnout from their attendings. We believe
that addressing these issues through formal education of sur-
gicalfacultywillimproveidentificationofandresponsetoresi-
dents who experience burnout and depression. In addition, at-
tendings who appreciate the high prevalence of burnout and
depression among surgery residents are more likely to be sup-
portive of implementing interventions designed to amelio-
rate these conditions.15
Residents also underestimate the prevalence of resident
burnout and depression. Despite 75% of residents scoring posi-
tive for burnout, only 53% estimated that most residents were
affected by it. Likewise, although 40% of residents were at el-
evated risk of depression, more than half underestimated the
prevalence of depression. We consider the following 4 poten-
tial reasons for these discrepancies: (1) residents may be un-
familiar with the signs and symptoms of burnout and depres-
sion in their coresidents, (2) residents may perceive the signs
and symptoms of these conditions as normal within surgical
culture, (3) residents are practicing in isolation, and (4) resi-
dents fear being labeled as inadequate, underperforming, or
the weakest link. These beliefs may result in compensatory be-
haviors, such as concealing their true status from their attend-
ings and resident colleagues.
More than 90% of residents and attendings were familiar
with burnout, and more than 70% strongly agreed that burn-
out is a legitimate medical condition. Despite this reported un-
derstanding, the data reveal that both cohorts underestimate
the prevalence of resident burnout and depression.
Barriers to Seeking Care
An improved understanding of risk factors for burnout and de-
pression and barriers to seeking care will facilitate the cre-
ation of targeted interventions. Residents and attendings must
acknowledge burnout as a legitimate medical condition and
become aware of resources available for treatment. That said,
awareness alone does not ensure the use of resources. Of in-
terest, residents and attendings were unified around the same
top 3 barriers to seeking care, which highlights an opportu-
nity for shared understanding and targeted interventions.
Our data demonstrate that the number of hours worked
per week by residents is associated with burnout and, more
specifically, the likelihood of depersonalization. In our study,
residents reported working a mean of 95 hours per week (in-
clusive of work in the hospital and at home), which exceeds
the current Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Edu-
cation Association guidelines of 80 hours per week averaged
across 4 weeks. Although these hours were self-reported and
we did not collect values reported in duty hour logs (which are
known to be inaccurate), this finding represents a potentially
modifiable factor in addressing burnout. Attendings esti-
mated that residents work a mean of 81 hours per week, which
is more consistent with current duty hour restrictions. The dis-
crepancy between attending and resident estimates in our
study may indicate that residents are not accurately report-
ing duty hours to their faculty or may reflect a lack of appre-
ciation by faculty of work performed at home. In addition, a
difference in perspective between residents and faculty as to
what is considered work compared with education might be
a factor, with faculty potentially considering education not to
be part of what should be included as reported work hours.
Differing perceptions about resident work hours may explain
why residents identified time constraints as the top factor lim-
iting care for burnout, whereas attending physicians did not.
Although we found no significant association between
personal health behaviors and burnout (except weekly exer-
cise), the data indicate the need for improvement in self-
care among residents. Thirty-one of the 85 residents (36%)
did not exercise at all, 41 of 76 (54%) only ate 2 meals per
day, 61 of 76 (80%) slept 5 to 6 hours per night, mean (SD)
consumption of caffeinated beverages was 2.5 (0.8) per day,
and 9 of 76 (12%) were at risk for heavy alcohol consump-
tion. Further reporting of resident lifestyle factors is found
in Table 4.
Future Directions
It is important to study how an individual’
s responses to
objective markers such as the MBI and PHQ-9 change
throughout residency and in response to interventions
designed to reduce burnout. Going forward, we plan to
obtain longitudinal data regarding burnout and depression

Limitations
The survey was only administered to surgery trainees in North
Carolina,whichisalimiteddemographicwithpotentiallyunique
risk factors and health behaviors. However, the risk factors and
barriers to care observed within our population are consistent
with previously reported themes in the literature.8 In addition,
1ofthe6generalsurgeryprogramsinvitedtoparticipatedidnot

We hypothesize that symptoms of burnout and depression
may vary based on surgical rotation and time of year or in par-
allel with other life variables. Our cross-sectional study cannot

We did not examine perceived causative factors of burn-
out among residents. Instead, residents were presented with
a list of 10 factors identified by previous studies as contribut-
ingtoburnoutandaskedtorank-orderthembasedonhowfrus-

understandingofwhatsurgicalresidentsperceivetobetheun-
derlying drivers of burnout, which may not directly equate to
reported frustrations, is essential for successful develop-
ment of strategies focused on prevention and treatment in sur-
gical trainees.
Conclusions
Despite the work that has been performed to characterize and
mitigate the harmful effects of burnout and depression in phy-
sicians, the challenge continues.18 Our study agrees with ex-
isting evidence that the prevalence of burnout and depres-
sion among surgical residents is high. The presence of suicidal
ideation should be a call to action.
Ourstudyexpandstheexistingliteraturebycomparingper-
ceptions from residents within this high-risk group with those
of their attendings. We found that residents and attendings un-
derestimated the true prevalence of burnout and depression;
however, both cited the same barriers to seeking care. Sys-
tematic improvements can be directed toward increasing
awareness and facilitating access to confidential treatment.
Surgeons must support a culture that identifies residents
at risk for burnout and depression and offers them practical
solutions to prevent and treat these conditions. The practice
of surgery demands a high level of mental, physical, and emo-
tional investment. Tension exists between strategies to re-
duce burnout and depression and the rigorous nature of the
work of surgeons. If we are to be successful at reducing these
conditions in this group, continued discussion and collabora-
tion between surgery residents and attendings is vital.
