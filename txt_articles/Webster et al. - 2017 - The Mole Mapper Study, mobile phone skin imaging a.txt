Sensor-embedded phones are an emerging facilitator for participant-driven research studies. Skin cancer
research is particularly amenable to this approach, as phone cameras enable self-examination and
documentation of mole abnormalities that may signal a progression towards melanoma. Aggregation and
open sharing of this participant-collected data can be foundational for research and the development of
early cancer detection tools. Here we describe data from Mole Mapper, an iPhone-based observational
study built using the Apple ResearchKit framework. The Mole Mapper app was designed to collect
participant-provided images and measurements of moles, together with demographic and behavioral
information relating to melanoma risk. The study cohort includes 2,069 participants who contributed 1,920
demographic surveys, 3,274 mole measurements, and 2,422 curated mole images. Survey data
recapitulates associations between melanoma and known demographic risks, with red hair as the most
significant factor in this cohort. Participant-provided mole measurements indicate an average mole size of
3.95 mm. These data have been made available to engage researchers in a collaborative, multidisciplinary
effort to better understand and prevent melanoma.

 Background & Summary
Melanoma is a cancer that arises from pigment-producing melanocytes in the skin. Clusters of
melanocytes known as melanocytic nevi, or moles, can be present at birth or can emerge throughout
childhood and young adulthood and are considered to be benign neoplasms. However, inherited or
acquired DNA mutations–in particular, those caused by ultraviolet radiation exposure1–can drive
malignant transformation to melanoma. The risk of developing melanoma varies widely depending on
genetic, demographic, and behavioral factors2. A family history of melanoma, fair skin and hair, a large
number of moles, and even profession3 can contribute to an increased overall risk.
Melanoma is the deadliest cancer of the skin, but early detection results in a highly significant
difference in survival: the 10-year survival rate for the earliest stage melanoma (stage IA) is 93%, whereas
for the latest stage it is only 10–15% (ref. 4). The significant survival benefit conferred by early detection is
the rationale for behavioral interventions aimed at increasing skin self-examination5 to recognize changes
to existing moles or identify newly emergent moles. Mobile phones with high-resolution cameras can aid
these efforts, providing a convenient tool for self-directed skin examination and documentation of the
results. In addition, recent innovations in mobile technology allow for self-tracking data to be remotely
contributed by individuals and aggregated for biomedical research studies that investigate normal
variation and disease symptoms across a large population6.
In October 2015, we launched the Mole Mapper Study, an iPhone-based observational study with an
accompanying app built using Apple’s ResearchKit framework (http://researchkit.org/). The Mole
Mapper iOS app enables participants to contribute measurements and images of their moles as well as
answer demographic and behavioral questions related to melanoma risk. The study app was specifically
designed not to provide medical advice. During the consent process, participants were required to
acknowledge this by answering a quiz question to demonstrate they understand that Mole Mapper
‘doesn’t provide medical care... and doesn’t provide diagnosis or treatment information’. As Mole Mapper
is explicitly not meant to recommend or replace in-clinic examination, our study doesn’t include
re-contact of users whose mole image suggests a possible malignant skin lesion.
Full app functionality was provided to all users independent of study enrollment status. From October
15, 2015 to June 1, 2016, the Mole Mapper iOS app was downloaded by 11,056 users, of which 2,798
(25.3%) chose to enroll and contribute their data to the study (Fig. 1a). Study participants self-selected
their data sharing preference, either with qualified researchers worldwide (‘broad sharing’) or only with

 the Mole Mapper study team and its partners (‘narrow sharing’). The study cohort described here is
composed of contributions from study participants who designated broad sharing of their data
(n = 2,069).
The study cohort includes data from participants across the US (Fig. 1b) that span a wide age range
(Fig. 1c). Demographic survey data documents several known melanoma risk factors within the cohort
(Fig. 2, Table 1). We observed that self-reported data recapitulates the expected association7 between
individuals with red hair color and melanoma diagnosis (Table 1), supporting the of the mobile-based
self-reporting survey instruments.
The Mole Mapper app quantitatively measures mole size by comparison to a reference item of known
size, such as a coin, to enable an absolute measurement in millimeters (Fig. 3a). We defined 59 body
zones in which to map mole location. Across this cohort, all 59 zones were documented, with the greatest
number of moles measured on the forearms and face (Fig. 3b). The curated participant-provided
measurements indicate an average mole size of 3.95 mm (median 3.56 mm, IQR 2.33–5.01) (Fig. 3c).
Repeated measurements were taken for 291 moles of the 2,868 total moles (10.1%) measured in the
cohort. These repeated measurements and images represent an opportunity to assess variance in mole
size change over time, and we anticipate that this resource will become more valuable as study
participants continue to add longitudinal data.
The Mole Mapper Study is ongoing, with continued development and iterative improvements based
on this initial stage of this project. Future directions of the study include implementation of automated
mole detection, integration of genetic testing results, inclusion of the Android operating system, and
extension outside of the United States.
The Mole Mapper Study takes a participant-centered approach, providing participants with control
over data generation and data sharing. This public data release and the open source nature of the app
code is in keeping with the commitment we have made to participants to maximize the utility of the data
they generously contribute. We hope to engage researchers across many disciplines, including computer
vision, dermatology, machine learning, cancer biology, and epidemiology, to better understand normal
skin health and ultimately reduce melanoma-related mortality.
Methods
Participant Onboarding
The Mole Mapper Study app was made available in the United States beginning in October 2015 through
the Apple App Store. An iPhone 4S or newer running iOS 8 or newer was required to download the app.
Enrollment was open to all individuals over age 18 with a US registered iPhone. Prospective participants
proceeded through an interactive eConsent process (http://sagebase.org/pcc/) utilizing the ResearchKit
framework (http://researchkit.org/). Participants were required to correctly answer a 5-question quiz
relating to their understanding of potential risks of contributing photos, the study aims, data security,
participant rights, and data sharing options. Participants electronically signed an informed consent form.
Participants then registered with the Sage Bionetworks Bridge Server infrastructure using an email
address and password. This email address was used for study enrollment verification and receipt of the

 signed consent form. Ethical oversight of the study was obtained from Western Institutional Review
Board (Protocol #20151976).
Participants were given the option to either share their data only with the Mole Mapper Study Team
and partners (‘share narrowly’) or to share their data more broadly with qualified researchers worldwide.
The data presented here consist of all individuals who chose to have their data shared broadly.
Demographic and Monthly Surveys
Directly after study registration, participants are asked to complete a one-time survey to provide
demographic and medical information about themselves relating to factors that may contribute to
melanoma risk, including self reported melanoma diagnosis and melanoma diagnosis for any blood
relatives (Table 2). Once each month during the study, participants are prompted upon opening the app
to answer 5 questions about the previous month relating to their behavior or medical status over the
previous month (Table 3). All questions in the surveys are optional for the participant to complete.
Participant-Provided Mole Measurements
The workflow for measuring a mole (Fig. 3a) begins by selecting a location on the body within any of 59
distinct body map zones (Supplementary Table 1). These zones represent a portion of the body that can
be captured by a typical mobile phone camera held at less than an arm’s length away.
Participants are instructed to take a photo of this entire zone, which may contain multiple moles. After
photos are taken, moles within the specified zone are identified by the user by dropping a pin and
dragging it over the mole. Participants select the mole they want to measure by tapping on a pin and
subsequently taking a photo of this mole adjacent to a reference item of known length. US coins are
presented as a default set of reference items, however participants can provide any reference of known
length, such as a USB connector or ruler.
The central 320 × 568 pixel frame of the photo is presented to the participant overlain with 2 circular
measurement tools: one for the mole and one for the reference item. Participants are instructed to drag
and resize the circles such that they circumscribe the mole and reference item, respectively. The diameter
of the circles in pixel size, together with the known value of the reference item in millimeters are used to
calculate an absolute mole diameter in millimeters using the following formula:
Mole Diameter in mm = (Reference Item Diameter in mm × Mole Diameter in pixels)/Reference Item
Diameter in pixels
Image Curation and Censoring
Images were assessed by at least two independent curators using the criteria outlined below for
identifiable or invalid images. If either of the 2 curators determined an image as identifiable or invalid, it

Data Collection and Distribution
The app records all data on-device within the sandboxed storage location for the app. If the participant
consented to the study, data is encrypted and sent to the Bridge Server, a set of web services developed
and operated by Sage Bionetworks (http://sagebase.org/)7. Bridge exposes RESTful API to collect and
manage mobile health data. This includes secure account creation, consent tracking, and collection of
other personal information separately from coded study data intended to be shared with research teams.
There are two parts to the encrypted data that is transferred from the participant’s phone to the server:
identifiable information upon enrolment (email, first/last name, consent record) and the non-identifiable
study data (mole measurements, demographics, etc.). These two components are stored separately and
linked by an encrypted account identifier and a healthCode, which indicates a study participant in the
coded data (https://developer.sagebridge.org/articles/security.html).
Coded study data, consisting of survey responses and image data, is exported to Synapse (https://www.
synapse.org/) for distribution to researchers. Synapse8 is a general-purpose data and analysis sharing
platform where users can work collaboratively, analyze data, share insights and have attributions and
provenance of those insights to share with others.
Code Availability
The Mole Mapper iOS app (https://github.com/Sage-Bionetworks/MoleMapper) was built using
Apple’s ResearchKit framework (http://researchkit.org/), which is open source and available on GitHub
(https://github.com/researchkit/researchkit). The Bridge iOS SDK (https://github.com/Sage-Bionetworks/
Bridge-iOS-SDK) provides integration with Sage Bionetworks’ Bridge Server, a back-end data service
designed for collection of participant donated study data (https://developer.sagebridge.org/). The Mole
Mapper app can be downloaded on the Apple App Store at (https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mole-

 Data Records
Upon enrollment in the study, participants were presented with a one-time demographic survey with
questions relating to factors that can influence the risk for developing melanoma (Data Citation 1;
Table 2). Each month after enrollment, a monthly follow-up survey (Data Citation 2; Table 3) was
presented that asked users about their activity and health over that past month. All questions were
optional and could be skipped with no information entered.
Participants were able to map the location and measure the size of moles on their skin using a
workflow described in the Participant-Provided Mole Measurements section. The mole measurement
tools were presented on screen as perfect circles that can be re-sized to circumscribe the mole and the
reference item. Each mole is auto-assigned a mutable name that is presented in the user interface, and an
immutable integer value that is used for data aggregation. Mole ID integer values are redundant within
the entire cohort dataset. To achieve a unique identifier for a given mole, the participant healthCode must
be combined with the mole ID. Participant-provided mole measurements (Data Citation 3) denote the
diameter of the calculated mole size in millimeters.
Participant-provided measurements contained over-represented and potentially artifactual data
resulting from default diameters that have not been adjusted by the participant. The default diameter
values are denoted in the dataset (Data Citation 3) for the following reference items: US penny, US dime,
US quarter.
Images from the mole measurements (Data Citation 4) have been curated following the procedure
detailed in the Image Curation and Censoring section. If an image was deemed to be possibly identifiable,
all metadata pertaining to that measurement remains in the dataset, but the image itself was removed
from the dataset. An image is flagged as invalid if it is not a photo of a mole or does not contain a
reference item by which to quantify the mole size.
If a user indicated that they had a mole removed, they were asked to denote which mole was removed,
and to take a photo of the biopsy site after healing (Data Citation 5). Photos of these moles are stored
together with all mole images (Data Citation 3).
Technical Validation
To determine the possible accuracy of measurements made with the Mole Mapper app, 4 black circles
were created on a piece of paper with the following diameters: 1 mm, 2 mm, 4 mm, 8 mm. These circles
were measured with 4 different reference items (a US penny, US nickel, US dime, US quarter) and the
app-provided, calculated diameter was plotted against the known standards. The R2 value for this
correlation was 0.9983, with a deviation from the known standard at any of the given references of less
than 0.1 mm. (Supplementary Fig. 1, Supplementary Table 2). It is important to note that the
measurements described above were obtained by a user with complete understanding of the provided
measurement instructions. Deviations from the intended workflow (i.e. switching reference item and
measurement circles) will provide inaccurate measurements.
