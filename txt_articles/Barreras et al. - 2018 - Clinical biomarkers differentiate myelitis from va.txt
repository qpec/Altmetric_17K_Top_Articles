Abstract
Objective
To assess the predictive value of the initial clinical and paraclinical features in the differentiation
of inflammatory myelopathies from other causes of myelopathy in patients with initial diagnosis
of transverse myelitis (TM).
Methods
We analyzed the clinical presentation, spinal cord MRI, and CSF features in a cohort of 457
patients referred to a specialized myelopathy center with the presumptive diagnosis of TM.
After evaluation, the myelopathies were classified as inflammatory, ischemic/stroke, arterio-
venous malformations/fistulas, spondylotic, or other. A multivariable logistic regression model
was used to determine characteristics associated with the final diagnosis and predictors that
would improve classification accuracy.
Results
Out of 457 patients referred as TM, only 247 (54%) were confirmed as inflammatory; the
remaining 46% were diagnosed as vascular (20%), spondylotic (8%), or other myelopathy
(18%). Our predictive model identified the temporal profile of symptom presentation (hy-
peracute <6 hours, acute 6–48 hours, subacute 48 hours–21 days, chronic >21 days), initial
motor examination, and MRI lesion distribution as characteristics that improve the correct
classification rate of myelopathies from 67% to 87% (multinomial area under the curve in-
creased from 0.32 to 0.67), compared to only considering CSF pleocytosis and MRI gadolinium
enhancement. Of all predictors, the temporal profile of symptoms contributed the most to the
increased discriminatory power.
Conclusions
The temporal profile of symptoms serves as a clinical biomarker in the differential diagnosis of
TM. The establishment of a definite diagnosis in TM requires a critical analysis of the MRI and
CSF characteristics to rule out non-inflammatory causes of myelopathy.
Classification of evidence
This study provides Class IV evidence that for patients presenting with myelopathy, temporal
profile of symptoms, initial motor examination, and MRI lesion distribution distinguish those
with inflammatory myelopathies from those with other causes of myelopathy.

Transverse myelitis (TM) is an inflammatory disorder affecting
the spinal cord. TM is recognized to be a heterogeneous syn-
drome, which manifests with motor, sensory, and autonomic
symptoms attributable to spinal cord dysfunction.1,2 The term
TM has been applied broadly to myelopathic syndromes in the
setting of autoimmune, demyelinating, infectious, and post-
infectious disorders. The diagnosis of TM presents a challenge
to the clinician as the list of possible differential diagnoses is
extensive and non-inflammatory myelopathies with neoplastic,
vascular, compressive, or metabolic etiologic origin often mimic
TM.3–5 While CSF pleocytosis or lesion enhancement on MRI
have been widely used to define inflammatory myelopathies,
similar features have been reported in non-inflammatory
myelopathies.3,4,6,7 The overlap of clinical, MRI, and CSF fea-
tures among the wide spectrum of myelopathies may lead to an
erroneous diagnosis of TM, and subsequent unwarranted
treatments with potentially harmful immunosuppressive ther-
apies and delays in adequate therapeutic measures.8,9
We performed a detailed evaluation of different types of
myelopathies and determined the value of the clinical features,
the temporal profile, spinal cord MRI, and CSF characteristics
for establishing a more accurate diagnosis in a group of over
450 patients presenting with myelopathy.
Methods
Study design and patient population
We retrospectively analyzed the clinical presentation, initial
neurologic examination, and characteristics of the initial MRI
and CSF profile in 457 out of 575 patients referred to a spe-
cialized myelopathy center for a newly established diagnosis
of TM from 2010 to 2015. A total of 118 patients were
excluded due to lack of complete or verifiable information
regarding their initial presentation. Patients referred for rea-
sons other than presumed TM, including those with a pre-
viously established etiologic diagnosis (e.g., multiple sclerosis
[MS], neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder [NMOSD],
spinal vascular malformations) were not included. We
recorded demographic characteristics, medical history, and
information on the clinical presentation including the tem-
poral profile, initial symptoms, and the neurologic examina-
tion. CSF analysis and MRI features including lesion
topography at the initial assessment were analyzed. As clini-
cally indicated, patients underwent additional studies in-
cluding serologic and imaging studies (e.g., spinal angiogram)
(see e-Methods, http://links.lww.com/WNL/A10).
Definitions
The final diagnosis was classified as inflammatory myelopathy
(IM), vascular myelopathy (VM), spondylotic myelopathy
(SM), or other causes of myelopathy (OM) (table 1). The
temporal profile from symptom onset to nadir neurologic
dysfunction was classified as hyperacute (<6 hours), acute
(6–48 hours), subacute (>48 hours–21 days), or chronic (>21
days). Nadir was defined as the point of worst neurologic
function, before improvement or plateau, based on history
and neurologic examination. Features of the initial pre-
sentation were confirmed during the clinical visit interview.
Statistical analysis
Our analysis had 2 aims: to (1) assess descriptively how
specific characteristics are associated with myelopathies of
different etiologies and (2) derive a subset of predictors that
improve the prediction accuracy of identifying etiologic origin
of a given myelopathy. For the first stage, we grouped char-
acteristics into 5 sets of potentially relevant predictors:
demographic/medical history (age, sex, ethnicity, smoking
status, obesity, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, autoim-
mune disease, infection in the last 30 days, vaccination in the
last 90 days), clinical presentation (temporal profile, presence
of motor, sensory, or bladder/bowel symptoms, new onset
back pain, worsening by exercise), neurologic examination
(motor examination, sensory abnormality, presence of urinary
retention or abnormal rectal tone, reflexes), MRI (sagittal
lesion location and extension, gadolinium enhancement [Gd+
], multifocality, axial lesion topography), and CSF (pleocy-
tosis, protein, immunoglobulin G index, and oligoclonal
bands [OCB]). For each group of predictors, we fit a multi-
nomial regression model where we considered each mye-
lopathy type as an outcome. Models for MRI and CSF
features were adjusted for time to MRI or time to lumbar
puncture.
Our second objective was to evaluate, after accounting for
Gd+ and pleocytosis, whether a subset of predictors would
improve accuracy in discriminating the different myelopathy
categories. We focused on estimation of the multinomial-
generalized
integrated
discrimination
increment
(IDI),
a measure of separation of the predicted probabilities for each
type of event, and the net reclassification improvement
(NRI), the proportion of participants correctly vs incorrectly
classified between 2 models, as measures that estimate
prediction increment of new variables15 (see e-Methods,

Results
Patient population
A total of 457 patients (58% female, median age 46 years,
interquartile range 33–56 years) with the presumptive di-
agnosis of TM were analyzed (table 2 and tables e-1, e-2, and
e-3, http://links.lww.com/WNL/A9). After thorough as-
sessment of the clinical, MRI, and CSF features, final di-
agnoses were reclassified as IM in 247 (55%) patients, VM in
92 (20%) patients (62 ischemic/stroke and 30 arteriovenous
malformations [AVM]/arteriovenous fistulas [AVF]), SM in
35 (8%) patients, and OM in 83 (18%) patients. For the VM
ischemic/stroke category, the diagnosis was definite in 13,
probable in 26, and possible in 23 patients. For 28 patients
with AVM/AVF, the diagnosis was definite; 2 patients with
prominent flow voids on MRI and a compatible clinical
profile declined angiography and were classified as probable
VM-AVM/AVF.
Demographics and medical history
The majority of patients were Caucasian in all categories.
Relative to the inflammatory group, AVM/AVF and SM were
more likely with increasing age (for AVM/AVF odds ratio
[OR] per 10 years increment: 1.78; 95% confidence interval
[CI] 1.34–2.44; for SM, OR 2.04; 95% CI 1.5–2.88). AVM/
AVF and SM were more common in men than in women (for
VM-AVM/AVF: OR 5.04; 95% CI 1.81–14.07; for SM: OR
3.09; 95% CI 1.29–7.35). A history of autoimmune disease
was less frequent in the VM-ischemic/stroke group compared
to IM (OR 0.25; 95% CI 0.07–0.89) and while a history of
a preceding infection was more frequent in IM, this was not
statistically significant in multivariate analysis (figure 1 and
table e-1, http://links.lww.com/WNL/A9).
Temporal profile
IM presented more often with a subacute temporal profile
(55%). Relative to IM, VM-ischemic/stroke exhibited more
frequently a hyperacute profile (89%; OR 35.19; 95% CI
8.92–138.90) in contrast to VM-AVM/AVF, SM, and OM,
which were significantly more likely to exhibit a chronic pat-
tern (83%, 86%, 61%, respectively; all OR > 3).
Initial symptoms
The presence of acute excruciating back pain at onset was
associated with the VM-ischemic/stroke group relative to IM
(OR 7.30; 95% CI 2.21–24.11); bladder/bowel dysfunction
and symptom worsening with exercise were associated with
the VM-AVM/AVF relative to IM (for bladder/bowel dys-
function: 4.12; 95% CI 1.37–12.44; for worsening with ex-
ercise: 13.99; 95% CI 2.02–97.11).
Neurologic examination
While weakness was present in the majority of patients,
a higher frequency was seen in the VM group (98%, table 2).
In participants with VM-ischemic/stroke and VM-AVM/
AVF, flaccid weakness was substantially more common rela-
tive to IM (all OR >10). Hyporeflexia was more frequent in
the VM-ischemic/stroke group (63%) relative to other types.
Participants with SM or OM were less likely to have com-
promised sphincters relative to IM (for SM: OR 0.30; 95% CI
0.09–0.99; for OM: 0.37; 95% CI 0.18–9.80). A sensory level
was more frequently seen in the VM-ischemic/stroke and
VM-AVM/AVF groups (79%, 70%) as compared with the IM,
SM, and OM groups (50%, 51%, and 49%, respectively). In all
categories the most frequent sensory level was thoracic.
MRI characteristics
Longitudinally extensive myelopathy (LE; 3 or more vertebral
levels in length) was observed in all groups but most fre-
quently in the VM group (ischemic/stroke 60%, AVM/AVF
70%). For VM-ischemic/stroke, this was significantly more
frequent when compared to IM (OR 3.87; 95% CI
1.15–13.02). Almost half of the IM and SM lesions (44% and
46%, respectively) exhibited LE. The likelihood of multifocal
lesions was higher in the IM group relative to any other my-
elopathy category. All of the reclassified myelopathies were
less likely to have Gd+ (all OR <0.50) relative to IM; however,
notably, this finding was not specific as 21% of the VM-
ischemic/strokes, 60% of the VM-AVM/AVF, and 46% of SM
patients category were also enhancing.
The pattern of lesion distribution for each diagnostic category
in both axial and sagittal views is shown in figure 2. The IM
lesions affected more frequently the posterolateral spinal cord
relative to all other myelopathy groups (all OR <1.0), and were
located more often in the cervical and upper thoracic spinal
cord (C1-T6). Lesions in the VM-ischemic/stroke group were
more frequently anterior (67%); these lesions were involving
more commonly the cervical cord and the lower thoracic spinal
cord. SM lesions tended to locate in the central spinal cord
(77%; OR relative to IM 4.59; 95% CI 1.50–14.0) and to be
more frequently cervical. Lesions involving the conus medul-
laris were more common in VM-AVM/AVF than IM (OR
19.23; 95% CI 3.35–110.38); these lesions were less likely to
involve the posterior cord relative to IM (OR 0.19; 0.04–0.76)
and were more frequently central (77%).
CSF features
The laboratory profile of the initial CSF obtained after the
onset of symptoms was available for 390 patients. Pleocytosis
was observed more frequently in the IM group (57%); how-
ever, it is worth noting that pleocytosis was also present in

 a substantial proportion of VM-AVM/AVF (35%) and VM-
ischemic/stroke (17%). Moreover, 43% of the patients who
met the criteria for IM did not exhibit pleocytosis. Elevated
protein was more frequently observed in the VM-AVM/AVF
and SM group (74% and 45%, respectively). OCB were al-
most exclusive of the IM group, although they were only
present in 45% of patients tested. Participants with VM-
ischemic/stroke were less likely to have pleocytosis or OCB
relative to IM (all ORs <1).
Prediction model for identifying diagnostic
category of myelopathies
Our predictive model selected the following predictors as
characteristics that improve discriminatory power for identi-
fying the correct diagnostic category of a given myelopathy:
temporal profile of symptoms, motor examination findings,
conus medullaris involvement, and presence of posterior
spinal cord lesions (table 3). By including these 4 additional
characteristics, the correct classification rate (CCR) increased
from 67% to 87% and the multinomial area under the curve
(AUC) increased from 0.32 to 0.67, suggesting marked
improvements in the correct classification of a given mye-
lopathy. NRI (34%) and IDI (38%) values associated with this
predictor set are also notable as both the CCR and AUC are
sensitive to the differences in the prevalence of underlying
outcomes. This suggests improved classification and more
succinct separation in prediction of diagnostic categories of
given myelopathies, relative to only considering Gd+ and
pleocytosis (typically used to define IM). Of all the predictors
considered, the temporal profile contributed to the largest
changes in IDI, NRI, and CCR relative to the traditional
model (Gd+ and pleocytosis). By including the temporal
profile only (and no other predictor), the CCR is 0.68 and the
multinomial AUC is 0.39.16 Relative to the null model (no
predictors), inclusion of the temporal profile results in an
improved integrated discrimination index of 15% (12%–19%)
and improved net reclassification index of 15% (2%–28%)
(table e-4, http://links.lww.com/WNL/A9). Results of our
sensitivity analyses (derivation of a prediction model only
considering demographics, clinical presentation, and neuro-
logic examination and no additional MRI findings) were con-
sistent. Relative to a model considering Gd+ and pleocytosis,
with the inclusion of motor examination findings and the
temporal profile of symptoms, the CCR increased from 67% to
81% and the multinomial AUC increased from 0.32 to 0.60. IDI
(26%) and potentially NRI (22%) similarly suggested im-
proved discriminatory power associated with the inclusion of
the temporal profile and motor examination findings.
Discussion
The broad differential diagnosis of TM makes it necessary to
develop strategies that accurately distinguish among the dif-
ferent etiologies of myelopathy. Our study, which is the
largest known cohort evaluating patients with presumed TM,

 demonstrated that only 54% of the patients referred as TM
had a confirmed inflammatory etiology. While this may reflect
to some degree a referral bias, it also reflects the confusion
surrounding the term “transverse myelitis” among clinicians
in the community. The use of this term is challenging since
inflammatory myelopathies do not always present in agree-
ment with the “classic” definition of the syndrome, as uni-
lateral, asymmetric, and chronic presentations can occur,17
signs of upper motor neuron disease are often not present
acutely, and sensory levels are frequently absent.1,9 In addi-
tion, the term TM is often used by clinicians to describe
involvement of the spinal cord in different pathologic con-
ditions even without clear evidence of inflammation, an ap-
proach that delays proper diagnosis and treatment. Hence, it
is critically important to identify clinical biomarkers that help
establish a correct etiologic diagnosis.
In our analysis, the clinical features distinguishing IM from other
causes of myelopathies at first presentation included the
temporal profile of symptoms (initial onset to nadir dysfunc-
tion), the initial motor examination findings, and the pattern of
lesion distribution on MRI. Since the temporal profile was the
most helpful predictor in improving the diagnostic accuracy, it
could be used in the clinical setting to guide the diagnosis of
myelopathy. A subacute presentation suggests an inflammatory
etiology, as described previously,2,9 while a hyperacute pre-
sentation suggests a spinal cord ischemic stroke. A chronic
evolution suggests a vascular lesion, such as VM- AVM/AVF,
a chronic SM, or other causes of myelopathy. These findings are
in agreement with previous descriptions of spinal cord stroke,18,19
compressive myelopathies,4,5 and vascular malformations.7,20
Another important factor to consider is the medical history. In
ourcohort,ahistoryofsuddenbackpainorworseningbyexercise
pointed towards a vascular etiology, which is in accordance with
previous descriptions.1 Conversely, a prior diagnosis of systemic
inflammatory disorder suggests an inflammatory myelopathy.
Several systemic disorders are known to potentially cause

 myelitis, such as Sj¨
ogren syndrome, systemic lupus eryth-
ematosus, and sarcoidosis,1,13 making a thorough medical history
crucial.
The assessment of lesion distribution on MRI is also extremely
important. The axial pattern may provide meaningful in-
formation about the underlying pathogenic mechanism. For
instance, MS would preferentially affect the myelinated tracts in
the posterolateral spinal cord. Similarly, a lesion affecting a dis-
crete vascular distribution or a spinal cord watershed area would
be highly suggestive of an ischemic stroke. Venous congestion
and venous hypertension in the setting of VM-AVM/AVF or
compression of the vasculature in SM would more frequently
affect the central cord region. The classification of LE vs non-LE
lesions was less helpful; while non-LE was suggestive of IM, the
differential diagnosis of LE lesions remained broad, and included
inflammatory etiologies (NMOSD, sarcoidosis, rheumatologic
and idiopathic myelitis) as well as VM and SM lesions.
Regarding MRI and CSF findings traditionally considered to
be associated with IM, such as pleocytosis, elevated CSF
protein, and Gd+, our cohort showed that these features were
not specific to the IM group. This is highlighted by the low
diagnostic accuracy in our model when considering only Gd+
and pleocytosis to differentiate IM from other myelopathies.
Moreover, previous studies described Gd+ and CSF pleocy-
tosis occurring in vascular6 and spondylotic myelopathies.5 A
recent study of 56 patients with spondylotic myelopathy
showed CSF pleocytosis in 12.5%, elevated CSF protein in
70%, and Gd+ lesions in up to 80% of patients.4 The high
frequency of these CSF and MRI features in non-
inflammatory myelopathies may account for their frequent
misdiagnosis as TM. Part of the difficulty in making this dis-
tinction arises from the common assumption that all CNS
inflammation is due to a primary inflammatory disorder. Any
injury to the CNS has the potential to cause a secondary in-
flammatory response that may manifest with some degree of
pleocytosis or disruption of the blood–brain barrier, causing
Gd+; in addition, hemodynamic changes in the lesion such as
vasodilation and “luxury perfusion” may also result in Gd+.21
This situation is well-illustrated by Gd+ in ischemic brain
strokes within 1 week of onset.22 Thus, evidence of a Gd+
lesion on MRI or CSF pleocytosis is not definitively diagnostic
of a primary inflammatory disease, and immunosuppressive
therapy may not be warranted. Instead, these findings should
be considered with the temporal profile and clinical pre-
sentation of the myelopathy, motor examination findings, and
MRI lesion distribution (particularly, the axial pattern). Taking
these features into account can increase significantly the correct
diagnostic classification of myelopathies.
The term TM should be used with caution as IMs do not
always present with a “transverse” sensory level and non-IM
may mimic inflammatory disorders. This highlights some of
the limitations of the 2002 acute TM criteria,2 which require
a clear sensory level and bilateral findings to diagnose TM and
additionally rely on CSF pleocytosis and MRI Gd+ to define
inflammation; the criteria could perhaps be improved by not
using the word “transverse,” not requiring bilateral findings or
a sensory level, and emphasizing the importance of the tem-
poral profile and consideration of non-inflammatory myelo-
pathies even in presence of CSF pleocytosis or MRI Gd+. It
would be less confusing to describe the myelopathic syn-
drome as being caused either by a primary inflammatory or
non-inflammatory etiology, the latter secondary to a specific
pathologic process. Once a diagnostic category is established,
a critical analysis of ancillary tests, including brain MRI and
spinal angiography, as indicated, is necessary to define the
specific etiology before assigning the label of idiopathic TM.
This study is limited by its retrospective nature. By analyzing the
inflammatory group as a category, this study may not reflect
important differences among specific etiologies within the in-
flammatory group such as MS vs NMOSD or NMOSD vs sar-
coidosis myelopathy as has been shown previously. In addition,
as a major referral center, cases that pose a diagnostic challenge

 are overrepresented in our cohort; therefore, the percent of IM
may not be reflective of what is seen in the community.
Myelopathies may encompass a wide differential diagnosis
that requires a thorough diagnostic workup with consider-
ation of inflammatory and non-inflammatory etiologies. The
temporal profile of symptoms might serve as a potential
clinical biomarker in the differential diagnosis of myelo-
pathies, which should be considered in conjunction with
a critical analysis of MRI and CSF characteristics.

Study question
Which clinical and paraclinical features of patients diagnosed
with transverse myelitis (TM) can differentiate those who have
inflammatory myelopathies from those with non-inflammatory
myelopathies?
Summary answer
The temporal profile of symptoms is the most powerful bio-
marker for differentiating inflammatory and non-inflammatory
myelopathies.
What is known and what this paper adds
TM is a highly heterogeneous inflammatory syndrome; non-
inflammatory myelopathies are often misdiagnosed as TM.
Gadolinium enhancement in MRI and CSF pleocytosis have
been used to define inflammation in TM. This study shows
that these features are nonspecific and that the subacute onset
of symptoms, the absence of flaccid weakness, and the pres-
ence of multifocal (cervical and thoracic, and posterior lateral)
lesions on MRI suggest an inflammatory etiology.
Participants and setting
The study examined 457 of 575 patients who had been di-
agnosed with TM and referred to a specialized myelopathy
center between 2010 and 2015. The other 118 were excluded
due to incomplete or unverifiable information.
Design, size, and duration
This study retrospectively analyzed patient records, including
demographic
characteristics,
medical
histories,
temporal
symptom profiles, initial symptoms, and results from neuro-
logic, MRI, and CSF examinations. The final diagnosis was
classified as inflammatory, vascular, spondylotic, or othercauses
of myelopathy. Multinomial regression modeling was applied
to determine characteristics associated with each final diagnosis
and predictors that would improve classification accuracy.
Main results and the role of chance
Of the 457 myelopathies evaluated, 247 (54%) patients had
a confirmed inflammatory etiology. Compared to inflammatory
cases, vascular myelopathies related to ischemic strokes were
more likely hyperacute (odds ratio [OR] 35.19, 95% confi-
dence interval 8.92–138.90), and other non-inflammatory
cases were more likely to exhibit chronic patterns (ORs >3).
Adding the temporal profile, initial motor examination features
and MRI pattern of lesion distribution to the multinomial
predictive model provided greater predictive power than only
considering CSF pleocytosis and MRI gadolinium enhance-
ment. Of all predictors, the temporal profile contributed the
most to the increased discriminatory power.
Bias, confounding, and other reasons for caution
The study is limited by its retrospective nature. The study also
grouped all inflammatory myelopathy cases together, not ac-
counting for important distinctions between various types of
inflammatory myelopathies.
Generalizability to other populations
This study examined cases at a major referral center, and
therefore, diagnostically challenging cases were probably
overrepresented in the cohort. The frequency of inflammatory
myelopathies may not reflect that found in the general patient
population.
