Abstract
Background
India has 23% of the global burden of active tuberculosis (TB) patients and 27% of the
world’s “missing” patients, which includes those who may not have received effective TB
care and could potentially spread TB to others. The “cascade of care” is a useful model
for visualizing deficiencies in case detection and retention in care, in order to prioritize
interventions.
Methods and Findings
The care cascade constructed in this paper focuses on the Revised National TB Control
Programme (RNTCP), which treats about half of India’s TB patients. We define the TB cas-
cade as including the following patient populations: total prevalent active TB patients in
India, TB patients who reach and undergo evaluation at RNTCP diagnostic facilities,
patients successfully diagnosed with TB, patients who start treatment, patients retained to
treatment completion, and patients who achieve 1-y recurrence-free survival. We estimate
each step of the cascade for 2013 using data from two World Health Organization (WHO)
reports (2014–2015), one WHO dataset (2015), and three RNTCP reports (2014–2016). In
addition, we conduct three targeted systematic reviews of the scientific literature to identify
39 unique articles published from 2000–2015 that provide additional data on five indicators
that help estimate different steps of the TB cascade. We construct separate care cascades

 for the overall population of patients with active TB and for patients with specific forms of
TB—including new smear-positive, new smear-negative, retreatment smear-positive, and
multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB.
The WHO estimated that there were 2,700,000 (95%CI: 1,800,000–3,800,000) preva-
lent TB patients in India in 2013. Of these patients, we estimate that 1,938,027 (72%) TB
patients were evaluated at RNTCP facilities; 1,629,906 (60%) were successfully diag-
nosed; 1,417,838 (53%) got registered for treatment; 1,221,764 (45%) completed treat-
ment; and 1,049,237 (95%CI: 1,008,775–1,083,243), or 39%, of 2,700,000 TB patients
achieved the optimal outcome of 1-y recurrence-free survival.
The separate cascades for different forms of TB highlight different patterns of patient attri-
tion. Pretreatment loss to follow-up of diagnosed patients and post-treatment TB recurrence
were major points of attrition in the new smear-positive TB cascade. In the new smear-nega-
tive and MDR TB cascades, a substantial proportion of patients who were evaluated at
RNTCP diagnostic facilities were not successfully diagnosed. Retreatment smear-positive
and MDR TB patients had poorer treatment outcomes than the general TB population. Limi-
tations of our analysis include the lack of available data on the cascade of care in the private
sector and substantial uncertainty regarding the 1-y period prevalence of TB in India.
Conclusions
Increasing case detection is critical to improving outcomes in India’s TB cascade of care,
especially for smear-negative and MDR TB patients. For new smear-positive patients, pre-
treatment loss to follow-up and post-treatment TB recurrence are considerable points of
attrition that may contribute to ongoing TB transmission. Future multisite studies providing
more accurate information on key steps in the public sector TB cascade and extension of
this analysis to private sector patients may help to better target interventions and resources
for TB control in India.
Author Summary
Why was this study done?
• India is the country with the highest burden of tuberculosis (TB) in the world, with one-
quarter of the world’s patients with active TB disease.
• The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that India has nearly 1 million “miss-
ing” TB patients, who have not been reported to the national TB program and who
therefore may not have received effective TB care.
• Government reports and studies from local regions of India suggest that a considerable
percentage of TB patients are evaluated at government health facilities but fail to be diag-
nosed with TB or fail to start TB treatment even if they are correctly diagnosed, but these
reports and studies have not been collectively analyzed to provide national estimates of
critical points at which patients are being “lost” from the government TB program.

 • The purpose of our study is to estimate how many TB patients in India’s national TB
program are not being detected, not enrolling in treatment, not completing treatment,
and not surviving without TB recurrence for 1 y after finishing treatment, using a model
called the “cascade of care.”
What did the researchers do and find?
• To estimate different steps of the TB cascade of care in India in 2013, we collected data
from multiple official reports published by the WHO and India’s national TB program.
• We also conducted three systematic searches of the medical literature to identify 39 stud-
ies published between 2000–2015 that describe patient loss to follow-up at different
steps of India’s TB cascade; we synthesized some of these findings using an approach
called meta-analysis.
• We estimate that, of about 2,700,000 prevalent TB patients in India in 2013, 1,938,027
(72%) were evaluated at government TB health facilities; 1,629,906 (60%) were success-
fully diagnosed with TB; 1,417,838 (53%) started TB treatment; 1,221,764 (45%) com-
pleted TB treatment; and about 1,049,237 (39%) achieved the optimal outcome of 1-y
recurrence-freesurvival.
• Patients who had a history of TB in the past (also called retreatment patients) and
patients with TB resistant to the two most effective medications (also called multidrug-
resistant TB) have considerably worse outcomes compared to other TB patients.
• The critical points at which patients are being “lost” to the government system varies
depending on the type of TB that a patient has.
What do these findings mean?
• Our findings suggest that, for some forms of TB—such as smear-negative TB and multi-
drug-resistant TB—increasing detection and diagnosis of new patients by using new
TB diagnostic tests may be the most important intervention for improving patient
outcomes.
• For other types of TB patients—such as new smear-positive patients—reducing loss to fol-
low-up immediately after TB is diagnosedand improving adherence to medications so
that TB is less likely to recur might be the best interventions to improve patient outcomes.
• Since a considerable proportion of patients who complete TB therapy experience recur-
rence of TB, routine follow-up of all patients for 1 y after completion of TB therapy may
be an efficient approach for identifying new TB patients.
• Our study is limited by the fact that very little information is available regarding treat-
ment outcomes for TB patients receiving care in the private sector and by considerable
uncertainty in the number of prevalent TB patients in India.
• We recommend that well-designed research be conducted at multiple sites in India’s
national TB program and in the private sector to improve the accuracy of the TB cascade
in the future and to monitor progress on TB control.

 Introduction
India has the world’s largest tuberculosis (TB) epidemic, with 23% of the global burden of
incident active TB patients annually and 27% of the world’s “missing” patients, representing
about 1 million patients each year who have not been notified to the Government of India’s
Revised National TB Control Programme (RNTCP) [1,2]. These patients may not have
received health servicesfor TB or may have received potentially suboptimal TB care in India’s
private sector [3,4]. In recent years, the RNTCP has changed its policy objective from success-
fully identifying 70% of new smear-positive patients and completing treatment for 85% of
these patients to a broader goal of “universal access to quality care” for all TB patients [5].
Similarly, the World Health Organization (WHO)’s post-2015 “End TB” Strategy hopes to
treat “all people with TB, including drug-resistant TB” and to end the global TB epidemic by
2035 [6].
Achieving such an ambitious objective in India will require improvements across various
RNTCP activities—including access to services,case finding, linkage of diagnosed patients to
treatment, retention in treatment, and coordination with private sector providers—to bring
about successful outcomes of treatment completion and, ideally, TB recurrence-freesurvival
for all patients.
The “cascade of care” is a useful model for evaluating care delivery by a health system for a
specific disease. This model has been used most extensively to assess the adequacy of HIV care
[7,8] but has also been used for other diseases, including type II diabetes and hepatitis C [9,10].
The model defines an outcome that all patients should achieve—for example, virological sup-
pression in the case of HIV. It outlines a series of sequential steps needed to achieve that out-
come. Estimates are provided of the number of patients who have successfully achieved each
sequential step. In the field of HIV, this model is sometimes referred to as the “continuum of
care,” reflecting the idea that, because HIV is a chronic disease, patients can sometimes move
“backwards” along these steps during their life course (e.g., dropping out of care after initially
being retained in care or developing HIV viremia after initially achieving viral suppression).
Since TB is usually not a lifelong disease and can be cured with appropriate therapy, we use the
term “cascade” to describe our model, even though TB patients can occasionally also move
“backwards” in care along the continuum.
The strength of the cascade model is that it allows policymakers to visualize the biggest gaps
in care delivery. They can then identify patient subpopulations who may be at highest risk for
adverse outcomes or who may drive the development of incident TB patients. The cascade
model may promote more efficient targeting of resources and motivate development of new
strategies for addressing shortfalls in care. While the WHO has promoted a similar “onion”
model (i.e., assessment of concentric layers of patient attrition) for evaluating local TB pro-
grams [11], to date, neither the onion nor the cascade model has been used to understand gaps
in care delivery for TB at a national scale.
In this article, we describe the TB cascade of care in the public sector in India for 2013,
based on an integrated model that draws from the WHO’s onion model and the cascade model
used for HIV. Although about half of India’s TB patients may receive private sector care
[12,13], we focus on the public sector alone, given substantial limitations in data on TB out-
comes in the private sector. Our primary objective is to estimate the number of patients com-
pleting each step of the cascade, and an important secondary objective is to highlight gaps in
knowledge in order to guide future research to improve the cascade’s accuracy. We also
describe cascades for new smear-positive, retreatment smear-positive, new smear-negative,
and multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB patients, to show how this model may shed light on care
delivery for specific patient subpopulations.

 Methods
Integrating the Cascade Model with the WHO Onion Model
The WHO onion model serves as an excellent starting point for constructing a TB cascade of
care; however, this model has a few deficiencies[11]. The WHO model has been primarily pro-
moted as a method for refining estimates of TB incidence. As a result, the stopping point for
this model is a programmatic outcome—the total number of TB patients notified to the gov-
ernment—rather than a patient-oriented outcome, such as cure, treatment completion, or
recurrence-freesurvival.
We believe that 1-y TB recurrence-freesurvival is a useful end outcome of the cascade. This
indicator not only reflects whether patients completed treatment but also whether treatment
was of high quality, since poor adherence increases the risk of post-treatment TB relapse or
death [14]. We assume that most patients with recurrent TB in the RNTCP are experiencing
disease relapse (rather than reinfection). Two studies help to justify this assumption. First, a
study of TB recurrence in South India that used genotypic techniques to compare the DNA fin-
gerprints of paired mycobacterial isolates from patients at the time of initial diagnosis and the
time of TB recurrence found that recurrence was due to exogenous re-infection in only 9% of
HIV-uninfected patients as compared to 88% of HIV-infected patients [15]. Since the preva-
lence of HIV-infection in the RNTCP’s overall population of TB patients is low (about 6%)
[16], this suggests that the vast majority of TB recurrence represents relapse of prior disease.
Second, another study in the RNTCP found that patients who took TB therapy irregularly were
twice as likely to experience TB recurrence, even after adjusting for other risk factors, suggest-
ing that the TB recurrence rate partly reflects medication adherence and the quality of care
received by patients [14].
We use a 1-y minimum time period after treatment completion to assess for recurrence-free
survival because most TB relapses (91%) occur within 1 y [17]. One-year post-treatment fol-
low-up is recommended by the Standards for TB Care in India [18], and routine 1-y follow-up
of all patients may be more feasible for national TB programs than longer follow-up periods.
The WHO onion model focuses on estimating “gaps” (the proportion of patients who did
not complete specific steps), while most HIV cascades estimate the absolute number of patients
who reach each step [7]. In most cascade models, the “gaps” are implied by each drop-off in
the bar graph.
We have therefore integrated the WHO onion model and the cascade model, as represented
in Fig 1. Each ring represents the estimated number of TB patients at that step of the cascade;
we will refer to each of these rings as a “step.” This integrated model incorporates the following
steps: (1) the total number of prevalent active TB patients in India, (2) the number of TB
patients who reached and were evaluated at TB diagnostic facilities, (3) the number of patients
diagnosed with TB, (4) the number of TB patients registered for treatment, (5) the number of
patients who achieved cure or treatment completion, and (6) the number of patients who
remained alive and TB recurrence-freeas assessed a minimum of 1 y (and no more than 24
mo) after completing therapy. For steps 2–6, we will only include data from public sector
RNTCP facilities in our analysis, as discussed further below. The spaces between the rings rep-
resent the proportion of patients who fail to complete each step; we will refer to these spaces as
“gaps.”
The steps and gaps in the model can also be divided into the following parts: accessing care
(Steps 1/2, Gaps 1a/1b/2), diagnosis and treatment registration (Steps 3/4, Gap 3), retention
during the treatment course (Step 5, Gaps 4a/4b), and recurrence-freesurvival (Step 6, Gap 5).
The steps and gaps are interrelated; in some cases we use data on steps to help estimate subse-
quent gaps and vice versa.

 Data Sources
Detailed information on the data sources and methods used to estimate cascade steps and gaps
are presented in Tables 1 and 2. The online database associated with WHO’s 2015 Global TB
Report provides the most recently revised estimate of the total number of prevalent TB patients
in India in 2013 [2,19]. The 2014 WHO Global TB Report provides an estimate of the total
number of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB) patients among notified TB patients in
the RNTCP in 2013 [1]. The RNTCP publishes national statistics annually in a document
called TB India: RNTCP annual status report [16,20,21]. This report contains statistics on the
total number of TB patients registered for treatment in the government program.
Treatment outcomes are provided in the TB India reports for all categories of TB, except
retreatment smear-negative patients [20]. Due to the long duration of treatment, final out-
comes for MDR TB patients are not reported until 3 y after treatment initiation. Therefore,
2013 is the earliest year for which we are able to construct a TB cascade of care that includes
patients with all forms of TB, since treatment outcomes for MDR TB patients registered in
2013 were published in the 2016 TB India report [21].

 We conducted targeted systematic reviews and meta-analyses of Indian studies published
from 2000 to 2015 to inform or estimate the following gaps in the TB cascade of care: (1) the
proportion of individuals in the community with cough >2 wk (i.e., suspected TB patients or
“chest symptomatics”) who have not sought medical care (Gap 1b); (2) the proportion of
patients who provide one sputum smear at designated microscopy centers but who fail to pro-
vide a second smear (sometimes referred to as “lost to follow-up during diagnosis” or “diagnos-
tic default,” used to estimate Gap 2) [23]; (3) the proportion of patients who are lost to follow-
up during the multistep diagnostic workup for smear-negative TB (Gap 2); (4) the proportion
of smear-positive patients diagnosed at microscopy centers who fail to register for treatment
(also known as “pretreatment loss to follow-up” or “initial default,” used to estimate Gap 3);
and (5) the proportion of TB patients who experience TB recurrence or death within 12–24 mo
after treatment completion (Gap 5). The PRISMA checklist and methods for each of these sys-
tematic reviews are presented in detail in S1–S4 Texts.
Analytical Approach
We organize TB patients registered in the RNTCP into the following categories: (1) new
smear-positive, (2) new smear-negative, (3) new extrapulmonary, (4) retreatment smear-posi-
tive, (5) retreatment smear-negative, and (6) multidrug-resistant (MDR). We define “retreat-
ment smear-positive” patients as including patients falling into the categories of treatment
after failure (TAF), treatment after default (TAD), and smear-positive relapse (i.e., patients
with TB recurrence) in the TB India reports. We define retreatment smear-negative patients
as consisting of patients listed in the category of “retreatment other” in the TB India reports,

 based on a recent study which found that the vast majority of “retreatment other” patients con-
sist of smear-negative patients with a history of prior TB [22]. For some forms of TB, no data
were available from the WHO reports, the TB India reports, or the published literature to esti-
mate a few of the gaps in the cascade. When reasonable, we extrapolated from estimates of the
same gap for other forms of TB. In general, we made conservative assumptions that favor better
outcomes for the health system.
In 2012, the Government of India issued an order for mandatory private sector notification
of TB patients facilitated by a web-based application called E-NIKSHAY. Private sector partici-
pation in E-NIKSHAY is low but slowly gaining momentum [26,27]; our study therefore
reflects a time period before a substantial increase in private sector notifications, when they
had been historically very low. Only 38,596 TB patients were notified to the government by the
private sector in 2013 [16], and, since treatment outcome data for these patients are not avail-
able, we exclude them from the cascade.
For many of the steps and gaps, uncertainty in the estimated number of patients has been
represented using 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs) when appropriate. Most of these 95%CIs
derive from the meta-analysis or pooled prevalence estimates that inform specific cascade
steps, based on studies identified through the systematic reviews. When appropriate, we have
been careful to propagate uncertainty in situations in which we were calculating a chain of esti-
mates involving multiple proportions or numerical estimates, each with its own confidence
interval. In such cases, we take the uncertainty of both values into account by multiplying the
upper and lower bounds of the confidence interval of the first value by the upper and lower
bounds of the confidence interval of the second value in a manner that produces the widest
possible confidence interval for the new value.
In addition, when calculating the “gaps” in the cascade, we subtract the upper bound of the
confidence interval for a step from the lower bound of the confidence interval for the preceding
step to estimate the most conservative lower bound of the confidence interval for the gap
between those steps. Similarly, we subtract the lower bound of the confidence interval for a
step from the upper bound of the confidence interval for the preceding step to estimate the
most conservative upper bound of the confidence interval for the gap between those steps. The
sources of uncertainty for the estimates of specific steps in the TB cascade of care are summa-
rized in Table 3.
Estimating Steps and Gaps in the TB Cascade of Care
Detailed explanations of the assumptions and calculations for every step and gap in the TB cas-
cade of care are included in S5 Text. We summarize the methods used to estimate every step
and gap below.
Accessing care. Step 1: We used the revised 2013 WHO prevalence estimate of the overall
number of TB patients in India as the starting step of the cascade [2,19] because TB prevalence
is estimated partly from population-based surveys. In contrast, estimates of incidence may be
more uncertain because they are extrapolated from the number of TB patients notified to the
government [28]. Also, TB incidence estimates exclude some types of retreatment TB patients
(specifically“failure” and “treatment after default”); these types of TB are relevant to the overall
cascade, since such patients require ongoing or modifiedtreatment and may continue to trans-
mit TB.
Gap 1a: The proportion of prevalent TB patients with no access to government TB facilities
is difficult to estimate based on existing data. As per the RNTCP, universal district-level cover-
age with directly observedtherapy (DOT) centers was achieved in 2006 [29]; however, recent
studies suggest that some subpopulations, especially remote Adivasi (“tribal”) populations,

 continue to have poor access to government TB services[31]. Unfortunately, national-level
data are not available to help quantify this gap, so we are not able to separate Gap 1a from Gap
1b. As a result, Gaps 1a and 1b are presented as a single gap in the cascade. We assume that
Gaps 1a and 1b can be estimated together as the difference between Step 1 (total prevalent
patients) and Step 2 (the number of TB patients seen at diagnostic facilities) (S5 Text).
Gap 1b: The proportion of patients with access to government TB serviceswho never seek
care at these facilities (and remain without care or in private sector care) is also difficult to esti-
mate using existing data. However, there are multiple population-based studies assessing the
proportion of people with cough >2–3 wk (i.e., people with suspected TB or “chest sympto-
matics”) who had not sought medical evaluation at the time of the survey.
This indicator has limitations, since the behavior of chest symptomatics may not fully reflect
the behavior of patients who actually have TB, because chronic cough could be secondary to
other causes, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or other chronic infections.
About 5%–10% of patients in India with chronic cough screened at government microscopy
facilities and about 2%–5% in community surveys have a positive sputum specimen for TB,
which suggests that cough for >2 wk has relatively low positive predictive value for TB [20,32–
36]. Screening for cough is also not completely sensitive for pulmonary TB, as a minority of
pulmonary TB patients do not have cough but instead have other symptoms such as chest
pain, hemoptysis, or fever. In addition, not having sought care at the time of the survey does
not necessarily mean that these individuals with suspected TB will never seek care.
Despite these limitations, we systematically reviewed and meta-analyzed studies of care-
seeking by chest symptomatics (S2 Text), because these findings still provide some value in
understanding TB care-seeking behavior at the population level. However, we did not use the
findings of this meta-analysis to calculate Gap 1b. Instead, Gaps 1a and 1b were estimated as
the difference between Steps 1 and 2 as noted above (S5 Text).
Step 2 and Gap 2: We estimated Step 2 (the number of TB patients who reach and are evalu-
ated at RNTCP diagnostic facilities) for all forms of TB except MDR TB through back-calcula-
tion from estimates for Step 3 (the number of TB patients who are successfully diagnosed).For
all forms of TB, we then estimated Gap 2 (the number of patients evaluated at TB diagnostic
facilities who remain undiagnosed)as the difference between the estimates for Step 2 and Step
3 (S5 Text).
To estimate Step 2 for new and retreatment smear-positive patients, we assumed that these
patients may remain undiagnosed despite being initially evaluated at a diagnostic microscopy
center if they are lost to follow-up before providing a second sputum specimen. We therefore
estimated the proportion of patients who fail to provide a second sputum specimen through a
meta-analysis of previous studies in India (Table F in S3 Text, and Results section, below). We
then estimated the number of new and retreatment smear-positive patients who might have
remained undiagnosed because they did not provide a second sputum specimen, by extrapolat-
ing from findings of a previously published meta-analysis that estimated a 11.9% incremental
diagnostic yield of a second sputum specimen for diagnosing smear-positive TB (confidence
intervals for this value are not provided in that manuscript) [37].
Based on these two values, we estimated that 1.3% (95%CI: 0.8%–1.8%) of smear-positive
patients presenting to TB diagnostic facilities may remain undiagnosedbecause some patients
fail to provide a second sputum specimen for diagnostic evaluation. Using this proportion for
Gap 2, we back-calculated an estimate for Step 2 from Step 3 for both new smear-positive and
retreatment smear-positive patients (S5 Text).
We estimated Step 2 for new smear-negative and retreatment smear-negative patients as fol-
lows: There are multiple reasons why smear-negative TB patients may remain undiagnosed
despite presenting to a government TB diagnostic facility. Due to lack of mycobacterial culture

 and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based diagnostic tests such as Xpert MTB/RIF at most
facilities, smear-negative TB patients are diagnosed empirically using a multistep workup that
includes a trial of broad-spectrumantibiotics and a chest X-ray (Fig B in S3 Text). Studies iden-
tified in our systematic review highlight dramatic attrition of smear-negative TB suspects dur-
ing each step of this workup (Table G in S3 Text) [38–40]; however, none of these studies
evaluated this diagnostic algorithm against a gold standard diagnosis of smear-negative TB
using mycobacterial culture. Therefore, it is unclear what proportion of “true” smear-negative
TB patients fail to get diagnosed.
We therefore used an alternative approach to estimate Step 2 for smear-negative patients.
Historical data suggest that the proportion of new smear-positive to new smear-negative TB
patients is 1:1 [41]; the RNTCP also cites this ratio in its training manual [42]. However, we
estimate a more conservative 1.42:1 (95%CI: 1.26:1 to 1.59:1) ratio of smear-positive to smear-
negative TB patients, based on data from the recent study evaluating the implementation of
Xpert at 18 sites in India (S5 Text) [24].
Using this ratio, we back-calculated the expected number of new smear-negative TB
patients being evaluated at diagnostic microscopy facilities (Step 2) from the estimated number
of new smear-positive patients being evaluated at these facilities (Step 2) (S5 Text). We also
used this ratio to back-calculate the number of retreatment smear-negative patients in Step 2
from the number of retreatment smear-positive patients in Step 2.
To estimate Step 2 for extrapulmonary TB patients, there are no studies we could identify
that estimate the proportion of extrapulmonary patients evaluated at RNTCP diagnostic cen-
ters who fail to get appropriately diagnosed. One local study suggests that the substantial
majority of extrapulmonary TB in India’s public sector is being diagnosed clinically without
collection of diagnostic samples for mycobacterial stain, culture, or histopathology [43]. Of the
most common forms of extrapulmonary TB, lymphadenitis is relatively easy to diagnose clini-
cally. Diagnosis of TB pleuritis is facilitated by a chest X-ray, and this imaging study may not
be available at many RNTCP diagnostic facilities, especially in rural areas [40]. Other forms of
TB are considerably more difficultto diagnose without invasive tests.
We therefore assumed that extrapulmonary TB is more challenging to diagnose than
smear-positive pulmonary TB, which by definition is easily diagnosable by sputum micros-
copy. We also conservatively assumed that extrapulmonary TB is easier to diagnose than
smear-negative pulmonary TB, as some forms of extrapulmonary TB are more clinically evi-
dent (e.g., lymphadenitis) or serious enough to warrant hospitalization (e.g., meningitis).
This assumption biases our estimates towards better outcomes for the RNTCP. We therefore
estimated the proportion of extrapulmonary TB patients who remain undiagnosed despite
presenting to a TB diagnostic facility by taking the average of the proportion of undiagnosed
smear-positive TB patients and the proportion of undiagnosed smear-negative TB patients
(S5 Text). This estimate for the proportion of undiagnosed extrapulmonary TB patients
allowed us to estimate Step 2 for extrapulmonary TB by back-calculation from Step 3
(S5 Text).
To estimate Step 2 for MDR TB patients, we used the WHO estimate of the number of
MDR TB patients among notified pulmonary TB patients in 2013 [1]. This estimate is derived
from culture-based studies conducted at RNTCP sites in India that estimate the prevalence of
MDR TB patients among both new and retreatment patients. In other words, this figure proba-
bly provides a relatively accurate estimate of the number of MDR TB patients who undergo
diagnostic evaluation at RNTCP microscopy centers. This estimate is not the same as the
number of MDR TB patients who are actually diagnosed in the public sector. Because most
RNTCP diagnostic facilities still primarily use smear microscopy, many of these patients are
not diagnosed with MDR TB and are instead misclassified as new or retreatment TB patients.

 We also cross-checked this WHO MDR TB estimate using data from the recent study
assessing the pilot implementation of Xpert MTB/RIF at 18 geographically diverse sites in
India [24]. This study found that the proportion of TB suspects diagnosed with rifampin-resis-
tant TB, which is presumed to be a marker of MDR TB, increased by 5.82 times between the
baseline phase (when Xpert was not being used, but sputum smears were used with drug-sus-
ceptibility testing only on high-risk patients) and the intervention phase (when Xpert was used
upfront for diagnosis and drug-susceptibilitytesting of all patients with suspected TB). In that
study, 31 out of 10,907 diagnosed TB patients were found to have drug resistance at baseline
compared to 1,190 out of 71,754 diagnosed TB patients after implementation of Xpert for
upfront screening. Correctingthis ratio for the fact that Xpert is only 67% sensitive for diagnos-
ing smear-negative TB [30], we estimate a 6.89 times rate of underdiagnosis of true MDR TB
patients evaluated at the vast majority of RNTCP diagnostic facilities relying on smear micros-
copy alone.
Since there were 9,466 (95%CI: 9,321–9,629) total MDR TB patients diagnosed nationwide
in the RNTCP in 2012 (the year the Xpert study was conducted), we multiply this value by 6.89
to estimate that 65,221 (95%CI: 64,221–66,343) true MDR TB patients reached RNTCP diag-
nostic centers and underwent diagnostic evaluation for TB. Notably, this estimate is very simi-
lar to the WHO’s estimate of 64,000 MDR TB patients among all notified pulmonary TB
patients in India in 2012 and 61,000 MDR TB patients in 2013. We therefore used the 2013
WHO estimate for Step 2 of the MDR TB cascade.
Diagnosis and registration in treatment. Step 3 and Gap 3: To estimate Step 3 (the num-
ber of patients diagnosed with TB) for new smear-positive and retreatment smear-positive TB
patients, we extracted the total number smear-positive patients diagnosed in 2013 from the
2014 TB India report [16]. This value does not separate new smear-positive and retreatment
smear-positive patients. We therefore assumed that the proportion of new smear-positive and
retreatment smear-positive patients among all smear-positive patients diagnosed in Step 3 is
the same as the proportion of new smear-positive and retreatment smear-positive patients
among all smear-positive patients registered in treatment in Step 4. Based on this assumption,
we estimated that 77.6% of all diagnosed smear-positive patients are “new” and 22.4% of all
diagnosed smear-positive patients are “retreatment,” which allows us to estimate the number
of new smear-positive and retreatment smear-positive patients in Step 3 (S5 Text).
We then estimated Gap 3 (pretreatment loss to follow-up) for new smear-positive and
retreatment smear-positive patients by calculating the difference between estimates for Step 3
and Step 4 [16,20]. Estimating pretreatment loss to follow-up in this manner may have short-
comings. It is possible that some patients might submit sputum specimens at multiple micros-
copy centers, which would lead to overestimation of Gap 3. Alternatively, some patients may
migrate or transfer to other centers and get re-registered in care, which could underestimate
Gap 3. For this reason, we also crosscheck this estimate by independently estimating the rate of
pretreatment loss to follow-up for smear-positive patients through a systematic review and
meta-analysis of studies (Table H in S3 Text and results section below).
We could find no studies of pretreatment loss to follow-up among new smear-negative,
extrapulmonary, or retreatment smear-negative patients to help inform our estimate of Step 3
and Gap 3 for these forms of TB; however, we estimated Step 3 and Gap 3 for these forms of
TB based on our findings on smear-positive pretreatment loss to follow-up. As with smear-
positive patients, most patients with these other forms of TB are diagnosed at government TB
microscopy centers. After diagnosis, they are referred to directly observedtherapy (DOT) cen-
ters close to their homes to start treatment. The studies of smear-positive pretreatment loss to
follow-up identified in this systematic review suggest that most patients are lost to follow-up
during the process of referral from government TB microscopy centers to DOT centers.

 Specifically, three of the studies in the review provide specific information on patient losses
during the referral process, and we used the findings of these studies to estimate the proportion
of all pretreatment loss to follow-up patients who are lost during the referral process [44–46].
Based on the overall smear-positive pretreatment loss to follow-up rate, we then estimated
the proportion of all smear-positive patients who experience pretreatment loss to follow-up
during the referral process. Since most new smear-negative, extrapulmonary, and retreatment
smear-negative TB patients also undergo this referral process, we conservatively estimated that
the pretreatment loss to follow-up rate (Gap 3) for these patients is the same as the proportion
of smear-positive patients experience pretreatment loss to follow-up during the referral pro-
cess. While some new smear-negative, extrapulmonary, and retreatment smear-negative
patients will also be lost to follow-up prior to referral, we assumed that most of these patient
losses will be captured in Gap 2 for these forms of TB (loss to follow-up during the diagnostic
workup). Using this estimate for Gap 3, we were able to back-calculate Step 3 from Step 4 for
new smear-negative, extrapulmonary, and retreatment smear-negative patients.
To estimate Step 3 and Gap 3 for MDR TB patients, we identified two studies that describe
the pretreatment loss to follow-up rate (Gap 3) for patients diagnosed with MDR TB through
our systematic review (Table H in S3 Text) [47,48]. We used the pooled prevalence of these
findings to estimate Step 3 by back-calculation from Step 4.
Step 4: For all forms of TB, we estimated the number of patients registered in treatment in
the RNTCP (Step 4) using values reported in the TB India reports [20,21].
Retention during the treatment course. Gap 4: Gaps 4a (loss to follow-up or death during
the intensive phase of therapy) and 4b (loss to follow-up, treatment failure, or death during the
continuation phase of therapy) could not be estimated separately since the TB India reports do
not provide information on the phases of TB therapy during which these poor treatment out-
comes occur. We therefore report Gaps 4a and 4b together as a combined Gap 4. We estimated
the proportion of patients who died, failed treatment, or were lost to follow-up during treat-
ment by calculating the difference between Step 4 and Step 5 using data from the TB India
reports [16,20].
Step 5: We estimated Step 5 (the number of patients who achieved cure or treatment com-
pletion) using data for each form of TB from the TB India reports [16,20]. This estimation
includes all forms of TB except for retreatment smear-negative patients. For retreatment
smear-negative patients, we estimated Step 5 based on findings from the only Indian study
reporting treatment outcomes for these patients, which describes a retreatment smear-negative
treatment completion rate of 83.2% (95%CI: 81.0%–85.2%) [22].
Recurrence-freesurvival. Step 6 and Gap 5: The final outcome of the cascade—the num-
ber of patients who are recurrence-free12 mo after completing TB treatment (Step 6)—was cal-
culated by extrapolating from the estimates for Step 5 (the number of patients who achieve
treatment completion) using estimates for Gap 5 (the proportion of patients who experience
post-treatment recurrence or death within 12–24 mo) for each form of TB.
We estimated these proportions for Gap 5 based on a systematic review of local studies con-
ducted in India’s public sector (Table K in S4 Text, and Results section, below). We estimated
Gap 5 based on the pooled prevalence of findings from two studies of new smear-positive TB
patients [14,25], four studies of new smear-negative and extrapulmonary TB patients [49–52],
and one study of retreatment smear-positive patients [25]. We assumed that the proportion of
patients who experience TB recurrence or death for retreatment smear-negative patients is the
same as that for new smear-negative patients, given that these forms of TB have very similar
treatment outcomes [22]. Since MDR TB patients have poor treatment outcomes, we made a
conservative assumption that their rate of post-treatment TB recurrence and death is similar to

 that of retreatment smear-positive patients, who have the highest recurrence risk of any form
of TB describedin our systematic review.
Results
Systematic Reviews Informing Steps and Gaps in the TB Cascade
Chest symptomatics who do not get evaluated at TB diagnostic facilities (Gap 1b). In
the systematic review of care-seeking by people in the community with cough >2 wk (i.e.,
chest symptomatics), out of 1,679 abstracts found by searching the literature from between Jan-
uary 1, 2000, and October 1, 2015, we identified 219 eligible for full-text review, out of which 8
contain relevant data for extraction (Fig A in S2 Text). All eight studies evaluate the proportion
of chest symptomatics who had not seen any provider by the time of the survey [32,53–59];
seven report whether patients sought care from public sector or private sector providers
[32,53–56,58,59]; and three report the proportion who had not been screened for TB with a
sputum test (Table C in S2 Text) [32,54,58].
Seven studies were conducted in 5 of India’s 36 states [32,53–56,58,59]. In addition, one
study collected data from households in 30 districts located in numerous states [57]. Some of
India’s poorest states with a high population, such as Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh, were
included. Three studies were conducted in urban areas, three in rural areas, and two in both
rural and urban areas (Table C in S2 Text). All of the studies are high quality with regard to
sampling strategy and sample size; however, six of the eight studies did not report the propor-
tion of people screened during their population-based data collection (low quality for this crite-
rion), and six studies did not report the proportion of chest symptomatics identified who
completed an interview (low quality) (Table C in S2 Text).
Meta-analysis of the eight studies estimating the proportion of individuals in the commu-
nity with cough >2 wk who report not having visited any medical provider after the onset of
cough show that, overall, 39% (95%CI: 30%–49%) of chest symptomatics had not seen any
medical provider (Fig 2). Meta-analysis of the seven studies estimating the proportion of indi-
viduals with cough >2 wk who report not having visited a public sector provider shows that,
overall, 76% (95%CI: 69%–82%) of chest symptomatics had not seen a public sector provider
(Fig 3). Meta-analysis of the proportion of individuals with cough >2 wk who report not hav-
ing visited a private sector medical provider shows that, overall, 65% (95%CI: 60%–70%) of
chest symptomatics had not seen a private sector provider (Fig 4). Three studies reported the
proportion of patients who had not received screening with sputum microscopy; these studies
found that 91%–97% of chest symptomatics had not been screened with sputum microscopy
at the time of the survey, even if they had been evaluated by a medical provider (Table C in
S2 Text).
TB patients evaluated at diagnostic facilities who are not successfullydiagnosed(Gap
2). In the systematic review of studies of TB patients evaluated at diagnostic facilities who fail
to get diagnosed with TB, out of 1,704 abstracts found by searching the literature from between
January 1, 2000, and February 26, 2015, we identified 26 eligible for full-text review (Fig C in
S3 Text). Of these, six studies contain relevant data on the proportion of chest symptomatics
who failed to provide a second sputum sample [23,38,60–63]. Three studies contain data on
the proportion of patients undergoing evaluation for smear-negative TB who fail to get a chest
X-ray, which is the final step in the diagnostic workup [38–40].
The six studies describing the proportion of patients who failed to provide a second sputum
sample were conducted in 7 out of India’s 36 states, with two studies focused solely on urban
populations, two studies focused solely on rural populations, and two studies focused on both
(Table F in S3 Text). The three studies describing the proportion of patients who completed
The TB Cascade of Care in India

 the diagnostic workup for smear-negative TB were conducted in three different states, with one
study conducted solely in a rural location and two studies conducted in both urban and rural
locations (Table G in S3 Text).
For the studies evaluating the proportion of patients who failed to submit two sputum speci-
mens, one study was medium quality because it was conducted at only one microscopy center
at an urban tertiary care hospital; the studies were high quality on other indicators (Table F in
S3 Text). One of the studies evaluating loss to follow-up during the smear-negative diagnostic
workup was excluded due to a small sample size of <150 patients (Table G in S3 Text) [38].
The meta-analysis of the six studies estimating the proportion of patients who fail to provide
a second sputum sample shows that, overall, 11% (95%CI: 7%–15%) of chest symptomatics fail
to provide a second sputum sample (Fig 5). Since there were fewer than five studies evaluating
the proportion of patients who fail to complete the workup for smear-negative TB, we did not
conduct a formal meta-analysis; however, these studies suggest that a large proportion (61%–
80%) of TB suspects fail to complete the multistep diagnostic workup for smear-negative TB
(Table G in S3 Text) [38–40].
Pretreatment loss to follow-up of smear-positive patients (Gap 3). In the systematic
review of studies of TB patients who get appropriately diagnosed but fail to get registered in
treatment (i.e., pretreatment loss to follow-up), out of 1,704 abstracts found by searching the
literature from between January 1, 2000, and February 26, 2015, we identified 26 studies eligible
for full-text review (Fig C in S3 Text). Of these, 14 contain relevant data on pretreatment loss
to follow-up of smear-positive TB patients [44–46,60,62–71], and two studies contain data on

 The studies of pretreatment loss to follow-up of smear-positive patients were conducted in
10 different Indian states. Four of these studies were conducted solely in rural areas; four were
conducted solely in urban areas; and six were conducted in both (Table H in S3 Text). The
studies of pretreatment loss to follow-up of MDR TB patients were conducted in both urban
and rural settings in two different states (Table H in S3 Text).
Of all 16 pretreatment loss to follow-up studies, four are medium quality for sample selec-
tion, because they collected data from single microscopy centers, potentially limiting their
representativeness at the local level (Table H in S3 Text). In addition, some studies were low
quality for study methodology(five studies) and time frame of evaluation (11 studies) (Table H
in S3 Text).
The meta-analysis of the 14 studies of smear-positive patients shows an overall pretreatment
loss to follow-up rate of 16% (95%CI: 12%–20%) (Fig 6). Three of these studies provide specific
information on the proportion of pretreatment loss to follow-up patients who are lost during
the referral process. These studies report that 98/120 (81.6%) [44], 62/63 (98.4%) [45], and 75/
145 (51.7%) [46] of pretreatment loss to follow-up among smear-positive patients occurred
during referral, for a pooled prevalence of 235/328 (71.6%, 95%CI: 66.5%–76.3%). The pooled
prevalence of the two studies of MDR TB patients shows a pretreatment loss to follow-up rate
of 23.0% (95%CI: 21.8%–24.3%) (Table H in S3 Text).
Post-treatment TB recurrenceand death (Gap 5). In the systematic review of studies
evaluating post-treatment TB recurrence and death, out of 2,547 short-listed abstracts found
by searching the literature from between January 1, 2000, and October 9, 2015, we identified 30
studies eligible for full-text review (Fig D in S4 Text). Of these, 10 contain data on post-treat-
ment TB recurrence or death in the RNTCP. Three of the studies evaluated predominantly

 HIV-negative smear-positive pulmonary TB patients who completed category I therapy; three
evaluated HIV-infected smear-positive pulmonary TB patients who completed category I ther-
apy; four studies evaluated a mixed population of smear-negative pulmonary, smear-positive
pulmonary, and extrapulmonary TB patients who completed category I or III therapy; and one
study evaluated retreatment smear-positive TB patients who completed category II therapy
(Table K in S4 Text).
Studies were conducted in five Indian states. Eight studies were conducted in urban areas
and two in rural areas (Table K in S4 Text). All of the studies are high-quality with regard to
sampling strategy; however, two of the studies did not report the proportion of the cohort that
was lost to follow-up during the study period [72,73]. Two of the studies describing TB out-
comes among HIV-infected individuals are very low in quality because they have a sample size
of <100 patients (Table K in S4 Text) [51,74].
We did not conduct a formal meta-analysis of these study findings, as none of these groups
had five or more eligible studies; however, we estimated the pooled prevalence of relapse and
death for these different types of TB from the limited available data. We excluded studies that
did not have complete data for both death and TB recurrence and studies that did not have at
least 12 mo and no more than 24 mo of follow-up.
For new smear-positive patients, we found two studies and estimate a pooled prevalence of
16.2% (95%CI: 14.25%–18.5%) for the combined outcome of TB recurrence and death [14,25].
For new smear-negative, extrapulmonary, and retreatment smear-negative patients, we found
four studies and estimate a pooled prevalence of 8.8% (95%CI: 6.9%–11.1%) for the combined
outcome of TB recurrence and death [49–52]. For retreatment smear-positive patients, we esti-
mate a 27.3% (95%CI: 19.1%–37.4%) combined outcome of post-treatment TB recurrence and

 death from a single study [25]. Notably, HIV-infected TB patients of all types have more vari-
able and often considerably higher rates of post-treatment TB recurrence and death (ranging
from 9%–61%) compared to the general TB population [51,52,74,75]. This suggests that HIV
co-infected patients may constitute a higher proportion of retreatment patients and poor
outcomes in the RNTCP than would be suggested by their 6% prevalence in the general TB
population.
The TB Cascade of Care for 2013
Table 4 and Fig 7 present the tuberculosis cascade of care in the government TB program in
India for 2013. Of 2,700,000 (95%CI: 1,800,000–3,800,000) prevalent active TB patients in
India, we estimate that 1,049,237 (95%CI: 1,008,775–1,083,243), or 38.9%, were successfully
treated in the RNTCP and achieved at least 1 y of TB recurrence-freesurvival. We divide our
discussion of estimates for each step and gap into the following sections: accessing care, diag-
nosis and registration in treatment, retention during the treatment course, and recurrence-free
survival.
Accessing care. Of 2,700,000 prevalent active patients with TB (Step 1), we estimate that
1,938,027 (95%CI: 1,840,748–2,050,001), or 71.8%, of TB patients reached and were evaluated
at government TB diagnostic facilities (Step 2), based on back-calculation for each form of TB
from estimates for Gap 2 and Step 3 (S5 Text). This suggests that about 761,973 (95%CI:
-250,001–1,959,252), or 28.2%, of prevalent TB patients did not have access to government TB
facilities, never sought TB care, or directly sought TB care in the private sector (Gap 1a/1b).
No data were available to provide further insights into estimates for Gap 1a. For Gap 1b, as
describedabove, the meta-analysis of studies evaluating care-seeking found that 39% (95%CI:
30%–49%) of individuals with cough >2 wk had not seen any medical provider at the time of

 the survey;76% (95%CI: 69%–82%) had not seen a public sector provider; and 91%–97% of
had not received evaluation for TB with sputum testing (Figs 2–4).
Diagnosis and registration in treatment. We estimated Gap 2—the proportion of TB
patients who remain undiagnosed despite being evaluated at government TB diagnostic facili-
ties—separately for each form of TB. For new smear-positive and retreatment smear-positive
patients, we estimate that 11% (95%CI: 7%–15%) of people with suspected TB who present to
government microscopy centers are lost to follow-up before submitting a second sputum speci-
men, based on the meta-analysis of six studies describedabove (Fig 5). Using an estimate of the
incremental yield of a second sputum specimen for diagnosing smear-positive TB [37], we
then estimate that 1.3% (95%CI: 0.08%–1.8%) of all smear-positive patients, or 9,491 (95%CI:
5,811–13,209) and 2,734 (95%CI: 1,674–3,805) new smear-positive and retreatment smear-
positive patients respectively, remained undiagnosed despite presenting to government diag-
nostic facilities (S5 Text).
For new smear-negative patients, using the 1.42:1 (95%CI: 1.26:1 to 1.59:1) ratio of new
smear-positive to new smear-negative TB patients seeking care in the public sector, we estimate
that 514,161 (95%CI: 456,873–582,402) new smear-negative TB patients sought evaluation at
government diagnostic facilities (Step 2) (S5 Text). Since 320,982 (95%CI: 318,491–323,148)
new smear-negative TB patients were successfully diagnosed (Step 3), we estimate that 193,179
(95%CI: 133,725–263,911), or 37.6%, of patients with new smear-negative TB remained undi-
agnosed despite evaluation at government facilities (Gap 2). This estimate is consistent with
the findings of our systematic review, which identified three studies showing that (61%–80%)

 of TB suspects fail to complete the multistep diagnostic workup for smear-negative TB, likely
resulting in considerable under-diagnosis (Table G in S3 Text) [38–40].
For retreatment smear-negative patients, we also used a 1.42:1 (95%CI: 1.26:1 to 1.59:1)
ratio of retreatment smear-positive patients to retreatment smear-negative patients to estimate
Gap 2 (S5 Text). Of 148,104 (95%CI: 131,602–167,760) retreatment smear-negative patients
evaluated at government diagnostic facilities (Step 2), we estimate that 105,893 (95%CI:
105,071–106,607), or 71.5%, were successfully diagnosed (Step 3) and 42,211 (95%CI: 24,995–
62,689), or 28.5%, remained undiagnosed(Gap 2).
For extrapulmonary TB patients, we assume that 19.5% (95%CI: 15.1%–23.6%) of patients
evaluated at TB diagnostic facilities remain undiagnosed(Gap 2). This suggests that about
310,284 (95%CI: 291,920–329,142) extrapulmonary TB patients were evaluated at TB diagnos-
tic facilities (Step 2), of whom 249,779 (95%CI: 247,840–251,465) were successfully diagnosed
(Step 3) and 60,505 (95%CI: 40,455–81,302) remained undiagnosed(Gap 2) (S5 Text).

 For MDR TB patients, we use the WHO estimate of 61,000 (95%CI: 47,000–76,000) MDR
TB patients among all notified TB patients in the RNTCP as the number of MDR TB patients
who underwent evaluation at government TB diagnostic facilities (Step 2). We estimate that
25,062 (95%CI: 24,678–25,493), or 41.1%, of these patients were successfully diagnosed with
MDR TB (Step 3), suggesting that 35,938 (95%CI: 21,507–51,322), or 58.9%, remained undiag-
nosed or got misdiagnosedwith other forms of TB (Gap 2).
Aggregating these findings, we estimate that, of 1,938,027 (95%CI: 1,840,748–2,050,001)
patients with all forms of TB who presented for evaluation to government TB diagnostic facili-
ties (Step 2), 1,629,906 (95%CI: 1,624,270–1,634,903), or 84.1%, were appropriately diagnosed
(Step 3) and 308,121 (95%CI: 205,845–425,731), or 15.9%, remained undiagnosed(Gap 2).
We also produced separate estimates for each form of TB for Gap 3—the proportion of
patients diagnosed with TB who do not get registered in treatment in the government TB pro-
gram (i.e., pretreatment lost to follow-up).
For Gap 3 among smear-positive TB patients, as noted above, the meta-analysis of findings
from 14 studies suggests a pretreatment loss to follow-up rate of 16% (95%CI: 12%–20%) (Fig
6 and Table H in S3 Text). This finding is concordant with our Gap 3 estimate using data from
the TB India reports (S5 Text) [16,20]. In that analysis, 928,190 new and retreatment smear-
positive TB patients were diagnosed in 2013 (Step 3) and 792,935 (85.4%) new and retreatment
smear-positive patients were registered in treatment (Step 4), suggesting there were 135,255
(14.6%) pretreatment loss to follow-up patients (Gap 3). Since this estimate is within the confi-
dence interval of the meta-analysis estimate, we use the more conservative Gap 3 estimate from
the TB India reports in the TB cascade.

 For Gap 3 among new smear-negative TB patients, using the 10.5% (95%CI: 9.8%–11.1%)
rate of pretreatment loss to follow-up, we estimate that 320,982 new smear-negative TB
patients were diagnosed (Step 3). Since 287,279 new smear-negative patients were registered in
treatment (Step 4), we estimate that 33,703 (95%CI: 31,212–35,869) were diagnosed but did
not get registered in treatment (Gap 3) (S5 Text). Using the same rate of pretreatment loss to
follow-up for extrapulmonary TB patients, we estimate that 249,779 patients were diagnosed
(Step 3). Since 223,552 extrapulmonary TB patients were registered in treatment (Step 4), we
estimate that 26,227 (95%CI: 24,288–27,913) were diagnosed but did not get registered in treat-
ment (Gap 3) (S5 Text). Using the same rate of pretreatment loss to follow-up for retreatment
smear-negative patients, we estimate that 105,893 patients were diagnosed (Step 3). Since
94,774 retreatment smear-negative patients were registered in treatment (Step 4), we estimate
that 11,119 (95%CI: 10,297–11,833) were diagnosed but did not get registered in treatment
(Gap 3) (S5 Text).
For MDR TB patients, using the Gap 3 estimate of 23.0% (95%CI: 21.8%–24.3%) from the
meta-analysis, we estimate that 25,062 (95%CI: 24,678–25,493) MDR TB patients were diag-
nosed in 2013 (Step 3), of whom 19,298 (77.0%) got registered in treatment (Step 4).
Aggregating these estimates, we estimate that 1,629,906 (95%CI: 1,624,270–1,634,903)
patients with all forms of TB were diagnosed in 2013 (Step 3), but only 1,417,838 (87.0%)
patients ultimately got registered in treatment (Step 4), which suggests that 212,068 (95%CI:
206,432–217,065), or 13.0%, of all TB patients in India were diagnosed at government TB diag-
nostic facilities but lost to follow-up prior to starting treatment (Gap 3).
Retention during the treatment course. The numbers of new smear-positive, new smear-
negative, extrapulmonary, and MDR TB patients who completed treatment were extracted
from the TB India reports, and the estimates for Step 4, Gap 4, and Step 5 for these forms of TB
are presented in Table 4 [20]. For retreatment smear-negative patients, one study describes a
83.2% (95%CI: 81.0%–85.2%) treatment completion rate in this patient population [22]. We
therefore estimate that, of 94,774 retreatment smear-negative patients who started TB treat-
ment (Step 4), 78,852 (95%CI: 76,767–80,747) achieved treatment completion (Step 5) and
15,922 (95%CI: 14,027–18,007) failed treatment, were lost to follow-up, or died during the
treatment course (Gap 4).
Aggregating these estimates, we estimate that, of the 1,417,838 patients with all forms of TB
who registered for treatment in the RNTCP in 2013 (Step 4), 1,221,764 (95%CI: 1,219,679–
1,223,659), or 86.2%, successfully completed treatment (Step 5). This suggests that 196,074
(95%CI: 194,179–198,159), or 13.8%, of these patients failed treatment, were lost to follow-up,
or died during the treatment course (Gap 4).
Recurrence-freesurvival. For new smear-positive patients, using the Gap 5 estimate of
16.2% (95%CI: 14.2%–18.5%) from the meta-analysis, we estimate that, of 541,736 patients
who completed treatment (Step 5), 453,975 (95%CI: 441,515–464,809) achieved 1-y recur-
rence-free survival (Step 6) and 87,761 (95%CI: 76,927–100,221) experience TB recurrence or
death within 12–24 mo of treatment completion (Gap 5).
For new smear-negative patients, using the Gap 5 estimate of 8.8% (95%CI: 6.9%–11.1%)
from the meta-analysis, we estimate that, of 258,551 patients who completed treatment (Step 5),
235,799 (95%CI: 229,852–240,711) achieved 1-y recurrence-freesurvival (Step 6) and 22,752
(95%CI: 17,840–28,699) experiencedpost-treatment TB recurrence or death (Gap 5). Using the
same 8.8% Gap 5 estimate for extrapulmonary TB patients, we estimate that, of 207,903 patients
who completed treatment (Step 5), 189,608 (95%CI: 184,826–193,558) achieved 1-y recurrence
free survival (Step 6) and 18,295 (95%CI: 14,345–23,077) experiencedpost-treatment TB recur-
rence or death (Gap 5). Using the same 8.8% Gap 5 estimate for retreatment smear-negative
patients, we estimate that, of 78,852 patients who completed treatment (Step 5), 71,913 (95%CI:

experiencedpost-treatment TB recurrence or death (Gap 5).
For retreatment smear-positive patients, using the Gap 5 estimate of 27.3% (95%CI: 19.1%–
37.4%) from the systematic review [25], we estimate that, of 125,901 patients who completed
treatment (Step 5), 91,530 (95%CI: 78,814–101,854) achieved 1-y recurrence-freesurvival
(Step 6) and 34,371 (95%CI: 24,047–47,087) experience post-treatment TB recurrence or death
(Gap 5). Using the same 27.3% Gap 5 estimate for MDR TB patients, we estimate that, of 8,821
patients who completed treatment (Step 5), 6,413 (95%CI: 5,522–7,136) achieved 1-y recur-
rence-free survival (Step 6) and 2,408 (95%CI: 1,685–3,299) experiencedpost-treatment TB
recurrence or death (Gap 5).
Aggregating these estimates, we estimate that of the 1,221,764 patients who successfully
completed treatment in the RNTCP in 2013 (Step 5), 1,049,237 (95%CI: 1,008,775–1,083,243),
or 85.9%, achieved the optimal outcome of 1-y TB recurrence-freesurvival (Step 6), and
172,527 (95%CI: 136,436–214,884), or 14.1%, experience TB recurrence or death within 12–24
mo of completing TB therapy (Gap 5).
The TB Cascade of Care in Specific Subpopulations
We present the TB cascade of care for 2013 for specific subpopulations of TB patients. These
cascades exclude Step 1 (the number of prevalent patients), since disaggregated prevalence esti-
mates are not available for most forms of TB. Because they start from Step 2 (the number of
patients evaluated at diagnostic facilities), these subpopulation cascades reflect the efficiencyof
RNTCP servicesin detecting, linking to care, treating, and retaining TB patients.

(95%CI: 726,428–733,826) patients who were evaluated at government diagnostic facilities, we

 estimate that 453,975 (95%CI: 441,515–464,809), or 62.2%, achieved 1-y recurrence-freesur-
vival. Moderate attrition of patients occurredat Gap 3 (diagnosed but not started on treat-
ment), Gap 4 (loss to follow-up, failure, or death while on treatment), and Gap 5 (post-
treatment TB recurrence or death).
Fig 9 presents the cascade for new smear-negative TB patients. Of the 514,161 (95%CI:
456,873–582,402) patients who were evaluated at government diagnostic facilities, we estimate
that 235,799 (95%CI: 229,852–240,711), or 45.9%, achieved 1-y recurrence-freesurvival. The
most substantial attrition occurredat Gap 2 (evaluated at diagnostic facilities but not diagnosed
with TB).
Fig 10 presents the cascade for retreatment smear-positive TB patients. Of the estimated
210,307 (95%CI: 209,247–211,378) patients who were evaluated at government diagnostic
facilities, we estimate that 91,530 (95%CI: 78,814–101,854), or 43.5%, achieved 1-y recurrence-
free survival. The most substantial attrition occurredat Gap 4 (loss to follow-up, failure, or
death while on treatment) and Gap 5 (post-treatment TB recurrence or death).
Fig 11 presents the cascade for MDR TB patients. We estimate that, of the 61,000 (95%CI:
47,000–76,000) MDR TB patients who reached government TB diagnostic facilities, only 8,821
(14.4%) were appropriately diagnosed and completed MDR TB therapy and 6,413 (95%CI:
5,522–7,136), or 10.5%, ultimately achieved 1-y recurrence free survival. While there is consid-
erable attrition at every step of the cascade, Gap 2 (evaluated at diagnostic facilities but not
diagnosed with MDR TB) contributed most to the cascade’s poor performance.

 Discussion
We constructed the cascade of TB care in India for 2013 with two different aims—(1) to iden-
tify critical points of patient attrition that may guide TB control interventions and (2) to iden-
tify knowledge gaps for different steps of the cascade in order to guide future research to
improve its accuracy.
Critical Points of Attrition in the Cascade
For the overall cascade including all forms of TB, the most substantial point of attrition is Gap
1a/1b, which suggests that more than one-quarter of prevalent TB patients in India (or about
760,000 patients annually) are not evaluated at government TB diagnostic centers. In addition,
our estimates for Gaps 2 and 3 together suggest that nearly one-fifth of prevalent TB patients
(or about 520,000 patients annually) interface with public sector TB servicesbut are either not
successfully diagnosed or are diagnosed with TB but lost to follow-up before starting treatment.
Together, Gaps 1, 2, and 3 indicate that nearly 1.3 million TB patients in India do not receive
therapy in the public sector—a finding that roughly corroborates the WHO’s estimate of “miss-
ing” TB patients in India [1,12,13].
National-level surveys suggest that a considerable proportion of these “missing” patients in
Gaps, 1, 2, and 3 are being treated by private sector providers [12,13]. The private sector in
India is very heterogeneous, and studies suggest that, in some locations, the majority of care is
provided by practitioners of Indian medical traditions (e.g., Ayurveda, Yoga, Unani, Siddha,
and Homeopathy [AYUSH]) or informal providers, who often have no formal medical
degrees [76]. The few available data suggest lower quality of care [3,4] and poorer treatment

 completion rates (about 50%) [77] in private facilities when compared to the public sector
(~85%), even in the context of public–private partnerships aimed at improving private sector
care.
To decrease Gap 1a/1b, more research is needed to understand the TB diagnostic and refer-
ral practices of private providers, especially AYUSH and informal practitioners who provide
most community-level care [76]. Data from Mumbai suggest that, when they do suspect TB,
most private providers prefer referring patients to public sector TB servicesor to private chest
physicians with expertisein managing TB [78]. However, a study in Delhi showed that only
one-fifth of unannounced standardized patients presenting to private providers with a classic
TB history were correctly managed with referral to public or private TB servicesor ordering of
an appropriate TB test (e.g., sputum microscopy) [4].
These findings highlight a need to bridge private providers’ “know–do” gap—the gap
between their intentions and actual practice—to increase referrals to the public sector and case
notifications. Enhanced engagement of the RNTCP with private providers, through robust
continuing medical education initiatives, on-site visits from RNTCP clinicians to review TB
patient management strategies, collaborative efforts at patient co-management with provision
of free medications from the public sector, and incentives to promote referral of TB patients,
may help to reduce this gap. At the same time, the cascade model emphasizes that improving
private sector case notification alone is inadequate; it is equally important to routinely collect
data on treatment outcomes and 1-y TB recurrence for patients treated in the private sector to
monitor this sector’s quality of care.

 The proportion of patients who never seek any TB care and remain untreated in Gap 1a/1b
remains uncertain, though our meta-analysis shows that about 39% of chest symptomatics had
not sought medical care at the time they were surveyed,which at minimum suggests delayed
care-seeking behavior. Public education may help to improve care-seeking behavior, which can
be monitored using serial population-based surveys. In addition, enhancing the availability and
accessibility of RNTCP facilities in hard-to-reach Adivasi (tribal) areas, where case detection
rates are very low, may help to reduce the proportion of India’s population without access to
TB care [31]. Finally, various strategies of targeted active case finding—especiallyhigher yield
strategies focused on repeated screening of household contacts of known TB patients [79], peo-
ple living with HIV [80,81], and individuals visiting health care facilities [82]—may also help
to substantially reduce Gap 1a/1b by identifying patients who may otherwisenot seek TB care
or do so with substantial delay [83].
Gaps 2 and 3 are notable because they suggest that about one-fifth of all TB patients in India
are “lost” despite engaging with government TB services.These patients go undetected during
the diagnostic workup at government facilities (possibly due to heavy reliance on insensitive
diagnostics such as smear microscopy) or fail to start TB treatment despite being successfully
diagnosed.Since this population of half a million patients is willing to engage with public sector
servicesin some capacity, they present a major opportunity for strengthening TB control.
Improving care at public sector facilities may help to retain these patients—by increasing case
detection (e.g., through use of more sensitive and rapid molecular tests), accelerating the time
to treatment initiation, improving linkage of diagnosed patients to care, and making TB ser-
vices more patient-friendly. In addition, since most diagnosed patients in Gap 2 are lost during
the process of referral from TB microscopy centers to local DOT centers [44–46], strengthen-
ing patient tracking and improving the accountability of the health system for these patients
may help address this gap.
While the RNTCP emphasizes the importance of treatment completion rates, our model
suggests that the gap immediately after treatment—post-treatment TB recurrence and death
(Gap 5)—may be an equally important contributor to the poor performance of the cascade.
Routine follow-up of all patients for 1 y after treatment may have substantial benefits for TB
control by promoting early detection of patients with recurrent TB, who are more likely to
have drug resistant disease. The yield of this approach for detecting new patients may be com-
parable or superior to other strategies of case finding, such as household contact tracing
[79,84].
The cascades for different subpopulations highlight different patterns of attrition for each
form of TB. For new smear-positive patients, multiple steps—pretreatment loss to follow-up,
loss to follow-up on treatment, and post-treatment TB recurrence or death—are equally impor-
tant points of attrition.
In contrast, for new smear-negative patients, failure to detect patients who present to diag-
nostic facilities (Gap 2) is the major point of attrition. In fact, we probably underestimate the
size of Gap 2 for these patients, because studies suggest that non-adherence of providers to the
diagnostic algorithm for smear-negative TB may be resulting in considerable overdiagnosis
[85]. As a result, patients with other pulmonary diseases might be incorrectly treated as having
smear-negative TB, a problem that we were not able to correct for in this model. Concurrent
use of alternative or more sensitive diagnostic tests (e.g., Xpert MTB/RIF or culture) may
reduce this gap. In addition, an emerging revision to the RNTCP smear-negative diagnostic
algorithm, in which chest X-ray is used upfront along with sputum smears, may reduce this
gap [86].
For retreatment smear-positive patients, poor outcomes while taking TB therapy and high
post-treatment recurrence and death rates are major points of attrition. Both of these points of

 attrition highlight a need for improved care of these patients after they register for treatment,
potentially through better access to drug-susceptibilitytesting, enhanced counseling, and closer
adherence monitoring. While HIV co-infected TB patients were not analyzed separately in the
cascade, the results of our systematic review of TB recurrence suggests that these patients may
also have substantially poorer treatment outcomes and higher rates of post-treatment TB
recurrence and death [51,52,74,75]. For MDR TB patients, the cascade suggests that the vast
majority of MDR TB patients who present to government diagnostic facilities are not diag-
nosed with drug resistance, highlighting an urgent need to move towards universal drug-sus-
ceptibility testing, as recommended by the End TB Strategy [6].
Limitations and Improving the Accuracy of the Cascade
A major limitation of this study is the substantial uncertainty in the estimate of prevalent TB
patients (Step 1), since India has not had a nationally representative TB prevalence survey con-
ducted in decades. This figure also represents an estimate of point prevalence and is possibly
an underestimate of the 1-y period prevalence of TB. Also, prior TB prevalence studies con-
ducted in India have usually screened individuals in the community for TB symptoms before
collecting sputum specimens [33,35,36]; this approach may miss a considerable proportion of
patients without symptoms, thereby underestimating TB prevalence [87]. In addition, a recent
study estimating the number of TB patients treated in India’s private sector suggests that the
overall burden of TB disease in India may be underestimated [88]. While the uncertainty in the
overall estimate of TB prevalence may impact interpretation of subsequent cascade steps, anal-
ysis of the cascade can also be performed starting from Step 2 (the number of TB patients eval-
uated at diagnostic facilities) and still provide substantial insights into the efficiencyand
functioning of the RNTCP.
A second major limitation of this study is the lack of data on the number of TB patients who
are detected, treated, and cured in the private sector. Similar to the WHO’s estimate of “miss-
ing” TB patients, our model assumes that these patients are essentially undiagnosedand
untreated. In reality, a considerable proportion of these patients have likely sought diagnosis
and treatment in the private sector [12,13,89]. As such, we overestimate the gap in case
detection and underestimate subsequent steps of the cascade. It is critical that the RNTCP
strengthen private sector notification and, perhaps more importantly, routinely assess treat-
ment outcomes for private sector patients.
A third limitation is the fact that we do not adequately account for possible misclassification
of patients who may have diagnoses other than TB or who may have other forms of TB. We
did assume, for example, that most MDR TB patients in Step 2 are subsequently misclassified
and treated as either “new” or “retreatment” patients. However, due to limited data, we did not
account for potential misdiagnosis with TB of patients who actually have other pulmonary pro-
cesses, including non-tuberculous mycobacterial infection [90]. Due to poor adherence to the
diagnostic algorithm, misdiagnosis with TB may especially be a problem for patients who have
negative sputum smears [85]. In addition, one study suggests that as many as 9%–13% of new
smear-positive patients started on treatment have a history of previous TB that was missed by
providers, which means that these patients should have been screened for MDR TB and treated
as retreatment smear-positive patients [91].
A fourth general limitation of our study is the inability to exclude duplicate patient records,
since we used aggregate data from the RNTCP to construct the cascade. A small percentage of
patients may have submitted sputum specimens at multiple facilities or have been registered
for treatment at multiple DOT centers, thereby leading to overestimation of certain steps and
underestimation of gaps. Preliminary analysis using computerized RNTCP records in Gujarat

 by one of this manuscript’s co-authors (KR) suggests that the percentage of duplicate records
for smear-positive patients is likely very small (about 0.02%) [92]. The ongoing rollout of
E-NIKSHAY, the RNTCP’s computerized case notification system, and India’s ongoing
Unique ID (Aadhar) card program may facilitate more accurate nationwide estimates of dupli-
cate records in the future.
A fifth general limitation is that time delays between steps are not well captured. This prob-
lem is especially relevant to patient care-seeking and case detection, since time delays (and not
just the gaps alone) contribute to TB transmission. A recent systematic review suggests a
median of nearly 2 mo delay in TB patients in India getting diagnosed after development of
symptoms [93]. In addition, understanding the timing of loss to follow-up during TB treatment
may help to target interventions for retaining patients on therapy.
A sixth general limitation is that we do not disaggregate the different types of poor outcomes
in the cascade—loss to follow-up, death, treatment failure, and misclassification of patients.
Since these are collapsed into single gaps in our current model, this limits understanding of the
transmission risks associated with specific gaps, as some poor outcomes (e.g., treatment failure
or loss to follow-up) may be associated with higher transmission than others (e.g., death).
Incorporating a detailed description of poor outcomes into future cascades may help guide the
development of interventions to reduce these gaps. A seventh general limitation is that we do
not present longitudinal trends in the cascade. As the RNTCP is currently undergoing multiple
transitions, including scale-up of Xpert MTB/RIF and switching from thrice weekly to daily TB
therapy for all patients, longitudinal evaluation of the cascade in the future may help to mea-
sure changes in the performance of the overall program.
Other study limitations are specific to each step of the cascade and are summarized in
Table 5, with suggested strategies for improving the accuracy of each estimate. For example,
Gap 1b—the proportion of TB patients who never seek care—is very difficultto estimate; how-
ever, this indicator may be assessed indirectly by using serial surveys of care-seeking behavior
by chest symptomatics or by conducting nationally-representative verbal autopsy studies that
assess whether patients who died of TB ever sought care. Alternatively, strengthening the medi-
cal certificationprocess for documenting causes of death, with subsequent audits of TB deaths
to see whether patients had sought care, may be preferable. Gap 2—the proportion of TB
patients seen at government diagnostic facilities who are not diagnosed—couldbest be assessed
for smear-negative and MDR TB patients through studies in which mycobacterial culture is
used to identify “true” TB patients, so that diagnostic attrition rates can be more accurately
estimated.
To best estimate Gaps 4a and 4b, the RNTCP should routinely collect and report data on
when patients are lost or die while taking TB treatment, as this will help to focus resources for
patient retention earlier or later in the treatment course. For Gap 6—the proportion of patients
who experience post-treatment TB recurrence or death—higher quality studies are needed that
estimate this indicator for all forms of TB, especially since routine follow-up of patients post-
treatment may be an efficient strategy for early detection of recurrent and potentially drug-
resistant TB patients.
The most recent year for which we could construct a complete cascade that included all
forms of TB was 2013. Since the treatment course for MDR TB is prolonged (often >18 mo),
treatment outcomes are not reported until 2–3 y after these patients are registered for treat-
ment. Since 2013, MDR TB case detection has improved in India, due to increased use of Xpert
MTB/RIF and line probe assays at select RNTCP sites to diagnose drug resistance, especially in
patients with HIV or a prior history of TB [24]. Indeed, recent TB India reports suggest a con-
siderable increases in the number of MDR TB patients registered for treatment from 12,285 in
2013 to 20,087 in 2014 and 26,966 in 2015 [16,20,21]. Therefore, the cascade presented here

 may provide baseline data against which emerging national efforts to improve MDR TB case
detection and treatment can be evaluated.
Finally, if our model of the TB cascade is applied to other settings, it may require consider-
able modification to adjust for local differences in TB epidemics. For example, in using

Forms of TB
Limitations and biases of current estimates
Optimal data needed to improve estimates
Step 1: Total prevalent TB patients
All forms of TB
No recent national prevalence survey; cities are
underrepresented in recent regional surveys; WHO point
prevalence estimate underestimates 1-y period prevalence;
asymptomatic/subclinical TB not accounted for
National or state level TB prevalence surveys that also
evaluate for asymptomatic TB in the community; regional data
should be supplemented with data from high-burden cities
Gap 1a: Patients with no access to government TB facilities
All forms of TB
No national survey data identifying localities with inadequate
access to RNTCP services
Collection of data on access to RNTCP services in national
household surveys like the National Family Health Survey
Gap 1b: Patients with access to government TB facilities who do not go to these facilities
All forms of TB
Indicator is inherently difficult to estimate; evaluation of surrogate
indicators may be required, such as chest symptomatic care-
seeking and the proportion of TB-related deaths who did not
access care
Assessment of chest symptomatic care-seeking can be
routinely incorporated into TB prevalence surveys; verbal
autopsy studies can assess whether patients who died of TB
accessed care prior to death
Gap 2: Patients presenting to government TB facilities who are not diagnosed
NSN / RO
Magnitude of underdiagnosis of NSN and RO patients uncertain
without TB culture-based studies
TB culture-based studies will help determine the proportion of
true NSN and RO patients lost during the diagnostic workup
EPTB
No studies identified that evaluate attrition during the diagnostic
workup for EPTB
Studies of attrition of EPTB suspects during the diagnostic
workup are needed
MDR TB
Magnitude of underdiagnosis of MDR TB uncertain without TB
culture-based studies
Culture-based studies will help determine the proportion of
MDR TB patients who are never diagnosed or misclassified as
retreatment patients
Step 3: Number of patients diagnosed with TB
All forms of TB,
especially NSN, EP
TB, MDR TB
Unlike for NSP patients, RNTCP statistics do not report the
proportion of NSN, EP TB, RO and MDR TB patients who are
diagnosed separately from the number registered for treatment
All forms of TB, including NSN, EP TB, RO, and MDR TB
patients should be notified to the RNTCP at the time of
diagnosis, rather than at the time of treatment registration
Gap 3: Patients diagnosed but not registered in treatment
NSN, EPTB, RO, MDR
TB
No studies identified that describe pretreatment loss to follow-up
of NSN, EP TB, RO, or MDR TB patients, in contrast to the
multiple studies describing this gap for NSP and RSP patients
Local studies of pretreatment loss to follow-up of these other
forms of TB are needed; studies can focus on loss to follow-up
after diagnosed patients are referred to DOT centers, as this
is when most patients are lost
Step 4: Number of patients registered for treatment
NSP, RSP, NSN
One study suggests that 9%–13% of NSP patients have a history
of prior TB treatment that was “missed” and therefore could
possibly be misclassified RSP or MDR TB patients [91]; studies
suggest poor adherence to the NSN algorithm may result in
empiric treatment of patients who have medical conditions other
than TB
More robust multisite studies are needed to estimate the
proportion of NSP patients with a history of “missed” prior TB
treatment; TB culture-based studies will help determine the
proportion of true NSN patients and the proportion of smear-
negative patients started on TB treatment who actually have
medical conditions other than TB
Gaps 4a/4b: Patients lost to follow-up or deaths early versus late in treatment
All forms of TB
RNTCP does not report whether patients on treatment are lost to
follow-up during the intensive versus the continuation phase
Routine reporting of lost to follow-up or death during each
phase of therapy may help in targeting interventions
Gap 5: Patients who experience TB recurrence or death within 1 y of treatment completion
All forms of TB
Local studies only evaluate post-treatment TB recurrence and
death for some forms of TB; the quality of these studies is poor
Multisite study of post-treatment recurrence or death is
needed; RNTCP can routinely assess 1-y post-treatment
outcomes for all patients

 recurrence-freesurvival as the end outcome of the cascade, we assume that most TB recurrence
is secondary to relapse of the same strain of TB [15]. However, this may be a less reliable end
outcome in settings with a high prevalence of HIV infection, since a higher proportion of TB
recurrences may be due to exogenous reinfection with a new strain of TB rather than relapse,
which means that recurrences are less likely to reflect the quality of prior TB care received by
the patient [94,95]. In addition, our cascade model will have to be modifiedin settings where
Xpert is the predominant diagnostic test, as our analysis assumes the smear microscopy is the
most common method of diagnosis.
Conclusions
We describe the TB cascade of care in India for 2013 and estimate that about 39% of prevalent
TB patients are treated in the government system and achieve an optimal outcome of 1-y recur-
rence free survival. Cascades constructed for subpopulations of TB patients highlight substan-
tial attrition and poorer outcomes among retreatment smear-positive and MDR TB patients,
and there are differences in the critical points of attrition for each type of TB.
TB control efforts in India are currently in the midst of a dramatic transition. The rollout of
E-NIKSHAY, the RNTCP’s electronic data management system, may help to improve private
sector case notification. Implementation of novel public–private partnerships in major Indian
cities may increase case detection, improve private sector quality of care, and capture data on
private sector treatment outcomes. Increased use of new diagnostic tests such as Xpert may
reduce the considerable gaps in diagnosis of both smear-negative and MDR TB. Newer
patient-centered models of care using electronic observation of therapy (e.g., through cell
phones or electronic pillboxes) have the potential to improve patient retention throughout the
treatment course.
In this context of rapid change, greater commitment of resources for TB control at the inter-
national, national, and state levels will be crucial for improving the outcomes of the TB cascade.
The cascade model could help to identify gaps in care in a manner that might inform the most
cost-effectivetargeting of resources in the public sector TB program. As with the Joint United
Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS)’ “90-90-90” global strategy for HIV, which is
based on the HIV cascade model, future multisite studies of the TB cascade in India could be
used to longitudinally measure TB control outcomes in a manner that accelerates progress
towards the goals of the End TB Strategy [6]. In addition, since substantial numbers of India’s
TB patients seek care in the private sector [12,88], a cascade of care analysis is urgently needed
to identify critical gaps in patient care-seeking, diagnosis, retention in treatment, and disease
recurrence in the private sector.
