Abstract
Background
The effectiveness of exercise training for preventing excessive gestational weight gain
(GWG) and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is still uncertain. As maternal obesity is
associated with both GWG and GDM, there is a special need to assess whether prenatal
exercise training programs provided to obese women reduce the risk of adverse pregnancy
outcomes. Our primary aim was to assess whether regular supervised exercise training in
pregnancy could reduce GWG in women with prepregnancy overweight/obesity. Secondary
aims were to examine the effects of exercise in pregnancy on 30 outcomes including GDM
incidence, blood pressure, blood measurements, skinfold thickness, and body composition.
Methods and Findings
This was a single-center study where we randomized (1:1) 91 pregnant women with a pre-
pregnancy body mass index (BMI) � 28 kg/m2 to exercise training (n = 46) or control (stan-
dard maternity care) (n = 45). Assessments were done at baseline (pregnancy week 12–18)
and in late pregnancy (week 34–37), as well as at delivery. The exercise group was offered
thrice weekly supervised sessions of 35 min of moderate intensity endurance exercise and
25 min of strength training. Seventeen women were lost to follow-up (eight in the exercise
group and nine in the control group). Our primary endpoint was GWG from baseline testing
to delivery. The principal analyses were done as intention-to-treat analyses, with supple-
mentary per protocol analyses where we assessed outcomes in the women who adhered to
the exercise program (n = 19) compared to the control group. Mean GWG from baseline to
delivery was 10.5 kg in the exercise group and 9.2 kg in the control group, with a mean dif-
ference of 0.92 kg (95% CI −1.35, 3.18; p = 0.43). Among the 30 secondary outcomes in
late pregnancy, an apparent reduction was recorded in the incidence of GDM (2009 WHO
definition) in the exercise group (2 cases; 6.1%) compared to the control group (9 cases;

 27.3%), with an odds ratio of 0.1 (95% CI 0.02, 0.95; p = 0.04). Systolic blood pressure was
significantly lower in the exercise group (mean 120.4 mm Hg) compared to the control
group (mean 128.1 mm Hg), with a mean difference of −7.73 mm Hg (95% CI −13.23,
−2.22; p = 0.006). No significant between-group differences were seen in diastolic blood
pressure, blood measurements, skinfold thickness, or body composition in late pregnancy.
In per protocol analyses, late pregnancy systolic blood pressure was 115.7 (95% CI 110.0,
121.5) mm Hg in the exercise group (significant between-group difference, p = 0.001), and
diastolic blood pressure was 75.1 (95% CI 71.6, 78.7) mm Hg (significant between-group
difference, p = 0.02). We had planned to recruit 150 women into the trial; hence, under-
recruitment represents a major limitation of our results. Another limitation to our study was
the low adherence to the exercise program, with only 50% of the women included in the
intention-to-treat analysis adhering as described in the study protocol.
Conclusions
In this trial we did not observe a reduction in GWG among overweight/obese women who
received a supervised exercise training program during their pregnancy. The incidence of
GDM in late pregnancy seemed to be lower in the women randomized to exercise training
than in the women receiving standard maternity care only. Systolic blood pressure in late
pregnancy was also apparently lower in the exercise group than in the control group. These
results indicate that supervised exercise training might be beneficial as a part of standard
pregnancy care for overweight/obese women.

Author Summary
Why Was This Study Done?
• Maternal obesity is associated with increased risk of several adverse pregnancy
outcomes.
• The aim of our study was to investigate whether exercise training during pregnancy can
reduce gestational weight gain and prevent negative health outcomes, such as gestational
diabetes mellitus and high blood pressure, among overweight/obese pregnant women.
What Did the Researchers Do and Find?
• Ninety-one overweight/obese pregnant women were randomly allocated to an exercise
group or a control group in early pregnancy (starting in pregnancy week 12–18).
• Women in the exercise group were asked to attend supervised sessions of combined
endurance and resistance training three times weekly.

 • Women in both groups gained on average about 10 kg. In late pregnancy, there seemed
to be fewer women in the exercise group with gestational diabetes mellitus, and the
exercising women had lower systolic blood pressure compared to those in the control
group.
What Do These Findings Mean?
• Providing an exercise program to overweight/obese pregnant women did not reduce ges-
tational weight gain compared to standard pregnancy care.
• Exercise training might reduce the incidence of gestational diabetes mellitus and lower
systolic blood pressure in late pregnancy in this population.
Introduction
Maternal obesity is a risk factor for adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as gestational diabetes
mellitus (GDM) [1], gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, need for cesarean delivery, and
large for gestational age [2–4]. Because the prevalence of overweight and obesity among repro-
ductive-age women is increasing, effective preventive strategies are urgently needed.
Excessive gestational weight gain (GWG) is also associated with negative obstetric outcomes
[1,5,6]. The 2009 Institute of Medicine (IOM) guidelines on GWG suggest that underweight
women (body mass index [BMI] � 18.5 kg/m2) should gain 12.5–18.0 kg during pregnancy;
normal weight women (BMI 18.5–24.9 kg/m2), 11.5–16.0 kg; overweight women (BMI 25.0–
29.9 kg/m2), 7.0–11.5 kg; and obese women (BMI � 30.0 kg/m2), 5.0–9.0 kg [7]. Overweight
and obese women are about two times more likely than normal weight women to exceed these
recommendations [8]; thus, there is a special need to find feasible and effective interventions to
reduce GWG in women with a high BMI.
Previous research on clinical effects of lifestyle interventions during pregnancy in over-
weight/obese women has shown conflicting results [9–14]. Most studies have assessed the com-
bined effect of physical activity and dietary guidance. To our knowledge, there are only three
previous randomized controlled trials (RCTs) [14–16] assessing the isolated effects of exercise
training in pregnancy on GWG and clinical outcomes in overweight and obese women. These
studies found no significant difference in GWG between exercise and control groups. However,
one study was limited by a small study sample (n = 12) [14], and one study reported results
from only a subgroup [15].
Few studies exist on GDM prevention via exercise training in obese women [17–19], and to
our knowledge no previous RCT has shown that GDM can be prevented by exercise training as
the sole intervention [14,18,20,21]. However, according to a recent meta-analysis [22], struc-
tured physical exercise programs during pregnancy decrease the risk of GDM. Hence, there is
still a need to establish the potential effects of exercise training on GDM prevention, and espe-
cially so in overweight/obese women.
To address the shortcomings in the research on effective prevention of GWG and of GDM,
our aim was to assess whether regular supervised exercise training could reduce GWG and
improve clinical outcomes, compared to standard maternity care, in women with a prepreg-
nancy BMI of 28 kg/m2 or more.

 Methods
Design and Participants
The study was approved by the Regional Committee for Medical and Health Research Ethics
(REK midt 2010/1522) and registered in ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01243554). The Exercise
Training in Pregnancy (ETIP) trial was a single-center, parallel-group RCT of regular exercise
training during pregnancy compared to standard maternity care in women with prepregnancy
BMI � 28 kg/m2. The study protocol has been published previously [23]. The trial was per-
formed at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) and St. Olavs Hospi-
tal, Trondheim University Hospital, in Trondheim, Norway.
We made the following changes to the protocol after trial commencement: body composi-
tion was measured using air displacement plethysmography starting 28 June 2011, to improve
assessments of body composition. The time limit for completed baseline testing and inclusion
into the study was changed from gestational week 16 to gestational week 18 on 15 November
2012, and we changed the inclusion criteria for BMI from �30 to �28 kg/m2 on 22 March
2013. We changed the time limit for inclusion and the BMI criteria to increase recruitment
into the trial. All changes were reported and approved by the Regional Committee for Medical
and Health Research Ethics. The procedures followed in the ETIP study were in accordance
with ethical standards of research and the Helsinki Declaration.
At recruitment, women received written information, and they signed informed consent on
behalf of themselves and their offspring before participation and randomization. Inclusion cri-
teria were prepregnancy BMI � 28 kg/m2, age � 18 y, gestational week < 18, and carrying one
singleton live fetus at 11–14 wk ultrasound scan. The participants had to be able to come to
St. Olavs Hospital for assessments and exercise classes. Exclusion criteria were high risk for
preterm labor, diseases that could interfere with participation, and habitual exercise training
(twice or more weekly) in the period before inclusion. Women were recruited through invita-
tions sent along with notices for routine ultrasound scan at the hospital, and additionally
through Google advertisements. The women received infant food worth US$65. The partici-
pants in this study gave written informed consent to publication of their case details.
Intervention and Outcomes
The exercise group was offered, in addition to standard maternity care, exercise sessions at the
hospital three times weekly, from baseline (gestational week 12–18) until delivery. The exercise
sessions were supervised by a physical therapist and were in accordance with the recommenda-
tions from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists [24]. Each session lasted
60 min and consisted of treadmill walking/jogging for 35 min (endurance training) and resis-
tance training for large muscle groups and the pelvic floor muscles for 25 min. The intensity of
the endurance training was set to ~80% of maximal capacity (corresponding to Borg scale 12–
15) [25]. The resistance training consisted of squats, push-ups, diagonal lifts on all fours, and
oblique abdominal crunches, with three sets of ten repetitions of each exercise separated by a
1-min rest between sets. Participants also did three sets of the “plank exercise” for 30 s. We
adjusted the program according to each woman’s strength level. The pelvic floor exercises con-
sisted of three sets of ten repetitions of pulling the pelvic floor up and holding the contraction
for 6–8 s.
In addition, the women were asked to follow a 50-min home exercise program at least once
weekly (35 min of endurance training and 15 min of strength exercises) and to do daily pelvic
floor muscle exercises. We registered adherence to the supervised exercise program, and the
participants reported their home exercise in a training diary. The participants received a weight

 gain curve showing recommended weight gain throughout pregnancy in accordance to 2009
IOM guidelines [7], and were encouraged to compare their own weight gain with this curve.
The women were invited to attend one motivational interview session [23], either individually
or in a group, during the intervention period.
The control group received ordinary maternity care by their midwife, general practitioner,
and/or obstetrician. The Norwegian national directions for standard maternity care among
healthy pregnant women at the time the study was conducted included offering of an ultra-
sound examination by gestational week 18 and providing information about healthy eating and
healthy lifestyle [26]. The women in the control group were asked to continue their normal
daily activities and were not discouraged from exercising on their own.
All participants underwent the same test protocol at baseline (gestational week 12–18) and
at late pregnancy (gestational week 34–37). In addition, the hospital personnel measured the
women’s body weight immediately before delivery.
Our primary outcome measure was GWG calculated as the difference between weight at
baseline and weight at delivery. Maternal body weight at baseline, in late pregnancy, and before
delivery was measured with a calibrated electronic scale (Seca 770, Medema, Norway) to the
nearest 0.1 kg, with the participant wearing indoor clothing, without shoes. If the hospital staff
did not have time to measure the women’s weight right before delivery, we used women’s self-
reported weight at the time of delivery to calculate the outcome measure.
Secondary outcome measures were BMI, body composition, physical activity level, skinfold
thickness, blood pressure, various blood tests, incidence of GDM, and incidence of maternal
hypertension in late pregnancy. Height was measured at baseline with a wall-mounted Seca
222 stadiometer. BMI was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in
meters. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure were measured on the right arm after 15 min of
supine resting using a CASMED 740 MAXNIBP (CAS Medical Systems). We used the average
of three measurements taken at 2-min intervals. Skinfold thickness was measured on the right
side of the body at the sites subscapular, biceps, and triceps, using a Harpenden Skinfold Cali-
per (Holtain). We used the average of three measurements for each site. Body composition was
measured using air displacement plethysmography (BOD POD, COSMED). The participant
entered the BOD POD wearing only underwear and a swim cap. Physical activity level was
measured by a questionnaire where the participants reported their frequency, duration, and
intensity of weekly physical activity.
After a 10-h fast, we drew venous blood for fasting plasma glucose and other blood mea-
surements. The participants then drank 75 g of glucose dissolved in 2.5 dl of water, and blood
was drawn again after 2 h (120-min plasma glucose). According to the study protocol [23],
GDM was to be diagnosed by the 2009 WHO definition: fasting plasma glucose � 7.0 mmol/l
and/or 120-min plasma glucose � 7.8 mmol/l [27]. However, in 2013 WHO, in collaboration
with the International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups (IADPSG),
endorsed adjusted diagnostic criteria for classification of GDM: fasting plasma glucose � 5.1
mmol/l and/or 120-min plasma glucose � 8.5 mmol/l [28]. GDM is therefore reported here by
both definitions. Plasma glucose, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP), total cholesterol,
high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, triglyc-
erides, HbA1c, ferritin, and hemoglobin were measured using a Roche Modular P. We assessed
insulin with ELISA (IBL International) using a DS2 ELISA processing system (Dynex Technol-
ogies). All assays were performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The inter- and
intra-assay coefficients of variation were 2.1% and 1.5% for glucose, 3.8% and <1% for high-
sensitivity CRP, 2.5% and 0.9% for total cholesterol, 2.8% and 0.8% for HDL cholesterol, 2.4%
and 0.8% for LDL cholesterol, 2.9% and 0.9% for triglycerides, and 5.3% and 9.5% for insulin.

 Homeostatic assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA2-IR) was calculated as [glucose × insu-
lin]/22.5 [29].
Statistical Methods
Sample size was calculated based on prior studies [30,31] using a 6-kg clinically relevant differ-
ence in mean weight gain between the exercise and the control group, from baseline to delivery.
According to this, a two-sided independent sample t-test with a 5% level of significance, a stan-
dard deviation of 10, and a power of 0.90 gave a target study population of 59 in each group.
Dropout was estimated at 15%; therefore, we aimed to include 150 women.
After baseline assessments, the participants were randomly allocated 1:1 to the interven-
tion or the control group. Allocation was done using a computer random number generator
developed and administrated at the Unit for Applied Clinical Research, NTNU. The randomi-
zation had varying block sizes, with the first, the smallest, and the largest block defined by the
computer technician at the Unit for Applied Clinical Research. The investigators enrolling
the patients (K. K. G. and T. M.) got the allocation results on screen and by e-mail after regis-
tration of each new participant into the study and did not have the full randomization list
available.
Weight measurement at delivery and blood analyses were done by personnel blinded for
group allocation. All other assessments and intervention administration were done non-
blinded. The statistician conducting the statistical analyses was blinded for group allocation.
The trial and the principal analyses were based on intention to treat. All available data were
used at all time points. We also performed, as described in the original protocol, per protocol
analyses including only the women in the exercise group who adhered to the exercise protocol
[23]. Baseline data were tested for normality and analyzed by an independent sample t-test and
by Fisher’s exact test.
The outcome measurements were analyzed in accordance to the treatment arm to which
patients were randomized, regardless of nonadherence. The effect of treatment on the pri-
mary and secondary outcomes was assessed with mixed linear models for continuous out-
comes and mixed logistic models for dichotomous outcomes. For the primary outcome, the
effect of time and treatment was taken as a fixed effect having the levels baseline, training late
pregnancy, control late pregnancy, training delivery, and control delivery. For the secondary
outcomes, the effect of time and treatment was taken as a fixed effect having the levels base-
line, training late pregnancy, and control late pregnancy. Due to randomization, no system-
atic differences between groups at baseline were assumed. To account for repeated
measurements, participant ID was included as a random effect. The analyses were performed
using R version 2.13.1, Stata version 13.1, and IMB SPSS Statistics 22. All results are given as
mean values with 95% confidence intervals, and p-values less than 0.05 were considered sig-
nificant. We did supplementary analyses of GWG where we adjusted for gestational age at
delivery.
Per protocol analyses [23] including only the women in the exercise group who adhered to
the exercise protocol were performed on both primary and secondary outcomes. Adherence to
the exercise protocol was defined as (1) attending � 42 organized exercise sessions, (2)
attending � 28 exercise sessions + performing � 28 home exercise sessions, or (3)
performing � 60 home exercise sessions. The exercise had to be �50 min of either aerobic or
strength training to count as a home session.

 Recruitment started on 20 September 2010 and was continued until 1 March 2015. The final
data collection date for the primary outcome measure was 20 June 2015. The aim of our study
was to include 150 participants, but enrollment was stopped on 1 March 2015 at 91 random-
ized participants, due to the prolonged time for inclusion and fewer eligible participants than
expected. Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics of the participants.
There were no significant differences between groups at baseline, except from mean fasting
glucose (4.6 mmol/l in the exercise group, 5.0 mmol/l in the control group; p = 0.02). Table 2
shows the model-based analyses for the continuous primary and secondary outcomes. The
mean number of weeks from inclusion to delivery was 23.3 (range 10–28) in the exercise group
and 24.7 (range 19–30) in the control group. Mean gestational age was 39.5 wk (range 27–42
wk) in the exercise group and 39.4 wk (range 37–42) in the control group.

 Gestational Weight Gain
We found no significant differences in GWG between the exercise group and the control group
(Table 2). Body weight at delivery was self-reported by five women in the exercise group and
four women in the control group. The proportion of women exceeding the IOM guidelines for
recommended GWG was similar in the two groups (Table 3). Adjusting for gestational age in
the analyses did not affect the GWG comparison between groups significantly (mean difference
0.56, p = 0.67).
Gestational Diabetes Mellitus
In late pregnancy, two women (6.1%) in the exercise group and nine women (27.3%) in the
control group had developed GDM according to the WHO 2009 definition [27], with a statisti-
cal difference between groups (p = 0.04; Table 3). According to the WHO/IADPSG 2013 defi-
nition of GDM [28], there was no significant difference between the groups (Table 3). There
was no significant difference in fasting glucose, 120-min glucose, insulin, or HbA1c level
between the groups (Table 2).
Blood Pressure and Other Secondary Outcomes
In late pregnancy we found a significantly lower systolic blood pressure (p = 0.006) in the exer-
cise group compared to the control group (Table 2). There were no significant differences in
other secondary outcome measures (Tables 2 and 3).
Physical Activity
The proportion of women reporting to be physically active for at least 30 min each day in late
pregnancy was equal in the two groups: 61% in the exercise group and 66% in the control
group (p = 0.73). The proportion of women reporting regular exercise training in late preg-
nancy was significantly higher in the exercise than in the control group: 77% and 23%, respec-
tively (p < 0.01).
Per Protocol Analyses
In the exercise group, 50% of the women fulfilled the training intervention as described in the
study protocol [23]. In the per protocol analyses, we found no significant difference in weight

Intention-to-treat model-based analyses with baseline mean (all participants), mean and 95% CI at late pregnancy/delivery for the exercise group and the
control group, and comparison between groups presented as mean difference, 95% CI, and p-value. The mother’s weight was measured and BMI
calculated at delivery, the rest of the measurements were at gestational week 34–37. The number of participants with missing data in the exercise group
varied between 0 and 5, in the control group between 0 and 3, for all variables except for body composition, where 12 participants in each group had missing
data. The effect of treatment was assessed with linear mixed models. For the primary and secondary outcomes, the effect of time and treatment was taken
as a fixed effect. Due to randomization, there were no systematic differences between groups at baseline. To account for repeated measurements,
participant ID was included as a random effect.

 Adverse Events
No adverse events were reported during the exercise training or study assessments (Table 4).
Discussion
Main Findings
We found no difference in GWG between women randomized to an exercise training program
versus standard maternity care, but found an apparent reduction in the incidence of GDM and
lower systolic blood pressure in late pregnancy among the women randomized to the exercise
training program. In the per protocol analyses including only the women who had adhered to
the exercise program (n = 19), exercise training also seemed to reduce diastolic blood pressure
in late pregnancy.
Gestational Weight Gain
Our findings of no difference in GWG and body composition between groups are in line with
several other clinical trials on overweight or obese pregnant women [14–16,32–34]. However, a
systematic review by Sui and Dodd [20] that included 216 participants (five randomized trials)
found that supervised exercise interventions were associated with lower GWG among over-
weight or obese pregnant women. But the trials included in this systematic review differed with

Intention-to-treat analysis based on observed data for the exercise and the control group and comparison between groups are presented as number of
participants (percentage), odds ratio, 95% CI, and p-value. The analyses of GDM and hypertension were done on the basis of blood tests and blood
pressure measurements in late pregnancy. The analysis of GWG relative to IOM recommendations was done on the basis of weight measurements at
delivery. The number of participants with missing data in the exercise group varied between 0 and 5, in the control group between 0 and 3. Data were
analyzed by a mixed logistic regression model.

 respect to the type and duration of exercise, and a clinically relevant difference in weight gain
was not precalculated. Also Barakat et al. [35] and Haakstad and Bø [36] found significantly
lower GWG among women who participated in supervised exercise during pregnancy. How-
ever, these two studies included women from all weight classes, and their findings might not
translate specifically to overweight/obese women. We can only speculate about why there was
no difference in GWG between the two groups in the ETIP study. The proportion of women
whose self-reported activity level fulfilled the recommended 30 min of daily physical activity in
late pregnancy was higher in the exercise group, but some of the women in the control group
exercised on their own. Only 50% of the women in the exercise group adhered to the exercise
protocol as prescribed a priori [23]. A possible effect of regular exercise during pregnancy may
have been missed in our study due to the relatively low adherence to the training protocol. Pro-
tocol adherence is a challenge in all exercise studies. We tried to improve adherence by offering
motivational talks throughout the intervention period, as well as adjusting the training times so
that more women would be able to attend. The low adherence may have been due to pregnancy
symptoms such as tiredness and nausea, limited previous experience with exercise training, or
difficulties in prioritizing time for exercise. Furthermore, the intervention protocol might have
been too comprehensive for these women. Further studies should carefully consider how exer-
cise adherence can be obtained in this population.
Although the exercise training program in our study followed the current recommendations
for exercise in pregnancy, it is possible that the exercise frequency and/or intensity of our pro-
gram were not sufficient to affect the outcome measures related to weight gain. As our study
population had a relatively low fitness level, the amount of energy spent during the exercise ses-
sions was rather low (~400 kcal/session) and was probably not sufficient to affect the energy
balance significantly. It is also possible that some of the women in the exercise group compen-
sated for energy expenditure during the exercise sessions either by decreasing their physical
activity level during the remaining time of the week [37] or by increasing their energy intake
[38]. According to three recent meta-analyses [32,39,40], interventions combining physical
activity and diet have proven effective in reducing GWG in overweight and obese women. We
did not include any dietary advice or intervention in our study, and probably exercise training
alone is not sufficient to reduce GWG in this population.
Changes in body composition throughout pregnancy might be an important determinant of
glucose metabolism. Few studies have assessed body composition changes after exercise in
pregnancy. Our findings of no significant differences between groups in body composition in
late pregnancy are in line with a recent RCT on the effects of a 16-wk moderate intensity
cycling program in overweight and obese pregnant women [33].
Gestational Diabetes Mellitus
Our finding of an apparently lower incidence of GDM according to the WHO 2009 definition
[27] among the women in the exercise group is in line with a recent meta-analysis of 13 RCTs
[22] that concluded that structured moderate intensity exercise programs during pregnancy
decrease the risk of GDM. However, two previous Cochrane reviews, one on exercise as the
sole intervention [19] and one on both diet and exercise interventions [41], concluded that
there is no clear GDM risk reduction after exercise training. Nobles et al. [42] randomized 251
women with increased risk of GDM to either exercise training or a comparison health and well-
ness group and found no reduction in GDM risk after exercise, in line with another previous
review [20]. The recently published DALI Lifestyle Pilot study [43] found that women with
BMI � 29 kg/m2 randomized to a healthy eating intervention had significantly lower fasting
glucose and 2-h insulin concentrations than women in an exercise only group. In contrast to
Exercise Training in Pregnancy

July 26, 2016
12 / 18
 the DALI study, our results indicate that exercise training alone may be sufficient to prevent
glucose intolerance in overweight or obese pregnant women. An important difference between
the DALI study and ours is that the exercise training was supervised in our study.
Using the WHO/IADPSG 2013 definition [28] of GDM in the ETIP study, the number of
GDM cases increased in both groups, and there was no longer a significant difference
between the groups. The WHO/IADPSG 2013 definition is mainly based on the HAPO study
(2008) [44], which found strong associations between glucose levels below the WHO 2009
diagnostic definitions and adverse outcomes for both mother and child. However, a retro-
spective cohort study [45] that included 1,892 women diagnosed with GDM according to the
WHO/IADPSG 2013 definition found a significantly higher risk for adverse pregnancy out-
comes in those who also would be diagnosed as having GDM according to the WHO 2009
definition.
Despite the difference between the exercise and control groups in GDM incidence, we
found no differences between the groups at late pregnancy in glucose levels, insulin, or
HOMA2-IR. One possible reason for this finding is that women with high risk of GDM may
respond differently to exercise training than women with lower risk [46], such that the average
glucose and insulin levels are not sufficiently affected to obtain a difference between groups.
Blood Pressure
We found a significantly lower systolic blood pressure among the women in the exercise group
in late pregnancy, compared to the women in the control group. Diastolic blood pressure did
not differ between groups in late pregnancy in the intention-to-treat analysis, but was signifi-
cantly lower in the exercise group in the per protocol analysis. High blood pressure in preg-
nancy is associated with increased risk for preeclampsia [47] and thus is important to prevent.
To our knowledge, only one previous RCT [33] has studied the effect of exercise training in
pregnancy on exact blood pressure measurements among overweight/obese women. Senevir-
atne et al. [33] found no effect of exercise training on blood pressure in late pregnancy. Other
studies that have assessed the effects of exercise on maternal hypertension risk have assessed
hypertension as a dichotomous variable [34,35,39]. Some of these studies found no effect of
exercise [17,34], but one study [35] found a reduced incidence of maternal hypertension after
exercise training. The latter study included both normal weight, overweight, and obese women.
Although fewer women in the exercise group than in the control group had hypertension in
late pregnancy in our study, the difference was not statistically significant. Further studies are
needed to ascertain whether exercise training can prevent hypertensive pregnancies in over-
weight/obese women.
Generalizability
The ETIP study had few exclusion criteria, and the participants were representative of Norwe-
gian women with BMI � 28 kg/m2 regarding age, parity, and education. However, participants
had to have time available for the testing and training. The exercise group was offered training
sessions at day and evening times. It is also possible that the participants volunteering for the
ETIP study were extra aware of the possible beneficial effects of exercise training in pregnancy
and thus were motivated to participate in our trial.
Clinical Relevance
Obese women have elevated risk of GDM and maternal hypertension; thus, finding effective
prevention strategies is highly relevant. The study revealed no adverse events related to
moderate physical activity during pregnancy. The effect of exercise training to reduce
Exercise Training in Pregnancy

 weight gain may most likely be improved with additional dietary interventions. During the
study we experienced difficulties in motivating the women in the exercise group to adhere to
the training program, despite supervised training sessions at St. Olavs Hospital, training ses-
sions at different times during the week, and individually adjusted exercises. We think fur-
ther studies should evaluate how supervised exercise programs for obese women can be
implemented in the health care system, as well as how to obtain good adherence to such
programs.
Strengths
In our study, exercise training was the only intervention provided. This makes it easier to assess
the isolated effects of exercise on pregnancy outcomes. The training program being standard-
ized and supervised makes it easy to reproduce. Furthermore, we had thorough recording of
exercise adherence as well as physical activity levels in the two groups. The primary outcome
measure (GWG) was assessed by personnel blinded for group allocation. We also regard the
assessment of body composition with the gold standard method of air displacement plethys-
mography as a strength.
Limitations
The main limitation of the trial was the reduced statistical power because we were able to
include only 2/3 of the 150 participants estimated in the power calculation. We analyzed 30 dif-
ferent secondary outcomes among a limited number of women, and thereby increased the risk
for detecting differences between groups by chance, and making type 1 errors. Furthermore,
only 50% of the participants in the exercise group performed the exercise training program per
protocol, which makes it more difficult to detect possible effects of the intervention. However,
adherence to exercise in the ETIP study was similar to that in most of the comparable clinical
studies. Care must be taken in interpreting the results from the per protocol analysis. Such
analyses could be selection biased if the reasons influencing compliance with the exercise train-
ing program are associated with prognostic factors [48].
Conclusion
In this trial we did not observe a reduction of GWG or an improvement in body composition
among overweight/obese women who were offered supervised exercise training during preg-
nancy. However, exercise training seemed to reduce the incidence of GDM as well as systolic
blood pressure in late pregnancy. As exercise adherence is a major challenge in this population,
there is a special need to find methods to reduce participant attrition in future studies.
