BACKGROUND: Capecitabine with oxaliplatin (CAPOX) has previously demonstrated clinical activity in patients with small bowel ade-
nocarcinoma (SBA) and ampullary adenocarcinoma (AAC). Herein, the authors conducted a phase 2 trial to evaluate the benefit of
adding bevacizumab to CAPOX. METHODS: In this phase 2, single-arm, single-center, open-label study, patients aged �18 years with
untreated, advanced SBA or AAC were recruited. Patients received capecitabine at a dose of 750 mg/m2 orally twice daily on days 1
to 14, oxaliplatin at a dose of 130 mg/m2 intravenously on day 1, and bevacizumab at a dose of 7.5 mg/kg intravenously on day 1 of a
21-day cycle. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) at 6 months. Secondary objectives included response rate,
overall PFS, overall survival, and toxicity. RESULTS: Between August 2011 and November 2014, a total of 30 patients were enrolled
into the study (male/female ratio of 13/17; median age of 63 years [range, 33-78 years]; and 7 patients with an Eastern Cooperative
Oncology Group performance status [ECOG PS] of 0, 20 patients with an ECOG PS of 1, and 3 patients with an ECOG PS of 2). Of
the 30 patients, 23 (77%) had SBA (18 of duodenal origin and 5 of jejunal/ileal origin) and 7 patients (23%) had AAC (5 of pancreati-
cobiliary subtype, 1 of mixed subtype, and 1 of intestinal subtype). The most common grade 3 toxicities observed were fatigue and hy-
pertension (7 patients each [23%]), neutropenia (6 patients [20%]), and diarrhea (3 patients [10%]) (toxicity was graded according
to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [version 4.0]). The probability of PFS at 6 months
was 68% (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 52% to 88%). The response rate was 48.3%, with 1 complete response and 13 partial
responses; 10 patients achieved stable disease. At a median follow-up of 25.9 months, the median PFS was 8.7 months (95% CI, 4.9-
10.5 months) and the median overall survival was 12.9 months (95% CI, 9.2-19.7 months). CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current
study indicate that CAPOX with bevacizumab is an active and well-tolerated regimen for patients with SBA and AAC. These findings
support the need for further investigation into the clinical benefit of targeting angiogenesis in patients with SBA and AAC. Cancer

INTRODUCTION
Small bowel adenocarcinoma (SBA) and ampullary adenocarcinoma (AAC) are rare tumors. The estimated incidence of
small bowel cancer in the United States for 2016 is 10,090 patients; of these cases, approximately 40% will be adenocarci-
nomas.1,2 The vast majority of patients present with late-stage disease, which in part relates to frequent delays in diagno-
sis.2 Although to the best of our knowledge there are no randomized clinical trials comparing the efficacy of various
chemotherapy regimens in patients with SBA, there have been 4 prospective studies, 3 of which used fluoropyrimidine
and oxaliplatin as the backbone of chemotherapy.3-6 We previously demonstrated that capecitabine with oxaliplatin
(CAPOX) is a safe and effective regimen for the treatment of both advanced SBA and AAC.4

 Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plays a
key role in tumor-associated neoangiogenesis, which helps
to provide a tumor with oxygen and nutrition and supports
the development of metastasis.7 We previously conducted
immunohistochemical staining for VEGF-A on 54 SBA
tumor samples and found that VEGF-A was expressed in
96% of cases.8 Another study noted the universal expres-
sion of VEGF-A messenger RNA in 56 SBA samples at sig-
nificantly higher levels compared with levels in adjacent
normal intestinal mucosa.9 To our knowledge, the role of
VEGF-targeted agents has not been prospectively studied
in the treatment of patients with SBA and AAC.
Bevacizumab, which is approved by the US Food
and Drug Administration, is a recombinant humanized
monoclonal immunoglobulin G antibody that binds to
VEGF-A and prevents its binding to receptors on endo-
thelial and cancer cells.10 The combination of CAPOX
and bevacizumab has been studied extensively in colorec-
tal cancer (CRC), and has been approved by the Food and
Drug Administration for the first-line treatment of
patients with metastatic CRC. A phase 3 study comparing
bevacizumab plus leucovorin, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), and
oxaliplatin (FOLFOX)/CAPOX with placebo plus FOL-
FOX/CAPOX demonstrated similar rates of grade 3 to 4
toxicity; however, the addition of bevacizumab was found
to improve outcomes, with a median progression-free sur-
vival (PFS) of 9.4 months with bevacizumab compared
with 8 months with placebo.11 Given the high level of ex-
pression of VEGF-A in metastatic SBA and AAC taken
together with the benefit noted with the addition of beva-
cizumab to chemotherapy in patients with metastatic
CRC, we hypothesized that the addition of bevacizumab
to CAPOX chemotherapy would improve anticancer ac-
tivity and improve outcomes for patients with these
malignancies.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
All eligible patients were required to have histologically
confirmed SBA or AAC; measurable metastatic disease as
defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
(RECIST) criteria12; an Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group performance status of 0 to 2; and adequate hema-
tologic (absolute neutrophil count � 1500/lL and plate-
let count �100,000/lL), hepatic (total bilirubin � 1.5
times the upper limit of normal and aspartate aminotrans-
ferase and alanine aminotransferase <3 times the upper
limit
of
normal),
and
renal
function
(creatinine
clearance > 50 mL/minute). Prior adjuvant chemothera-
py (including 5-FU, capecitabine, and oxaliplatin) was
permitted if completed �52 weeks prior and previous
capecitabine or 5-FU administered as a radiosensitizing
agent was allowed. A minimum of 4 weeks must have
elapsed from the time of completion of any prior chemo-
therapy, radiotherapy, or surgery. Patients with any of the
following were not eligible to participate in the current
study: prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease; a known
history of dihydropyrimidine deficiency; peripheral neu-
ropathy of � grade 3; inadequately controlled hyperten-
sion (systolic blood pressure > 140 mm Hg and/or
diastolic blood pressure >90 mm Hg) or a history of hy-
pertensive crisis/encephalopathy; New York Heart Associ-
ation �class II congestive heart failure; and myocardial
infarction, unstable angina, cerebrovascular accident,
transient ischemic attack, or significant vascular disease
within the previous 6 months. The Institutional Review
Board of The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer
Center approved the study protocol and all patients pro-
vided written informed consent.
Study Design
The current study was an open-label, single-arm, single-
institution, phase 2 study conducted at The University of
Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. Treatment consisted
of intravenous oxaliplatin (at a dose of 130 mg/m2) ad-
ministered on day 1, intravenous bevacizumab (at a dose
of 7.5 mg/kg) administered on day 1, and oral capecita-
bine (at a dose of 1500 mg/m2) divided twice daily on
days 1 to 14 of each treatment cycle. Treatment cycles
were repeated every 21 days and imaging studies were
conducted every 3 cycles. Treatment was continued until
disease progression, intercurrent illness preventing the
further administration of treatments, severe predefined
treatment-related toxicities, or a treatment delay of >4
weeks due to toxicity.
Dose Reductions
Toxicity was graded according to the National Cancer In-
stitute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events
(version 4.0), except for neurosensory and skin toxicity.
Neurosensory toxicity was graded according to the Neu-
rologic Toxicity Scale for Oxaliplatin Dose Adjustments.
Neurosensory toxicity did not result in dose reductions
for capecitabine or bevacizumab. A new cycle of chemo-
therapy with capecitabine, oxaliplatin, and bevacizumab
was delayed until the absolute neutrophil count was
�1000/mm3; the platelet count was �75,000/mm3; and
recovery was achieved from any treatment-related, non-
hematological toxicity (except alopecia and oxaliplatin-

 related neurosensory toxicity) to baseline or was �grade
1.
Treatment with capecitabine was interrupted during
a cycle for grade 3 or 4 hematologic toxicities (excluding
anemia) or for � grade 2 non-hematologic toxicities (ex-
cluding grade 2 nausea or vomiting). The capecitabine
dose was reduced by 25% for grade 2 hand-foot syndrome
and by 50% for grade 3 hand-foot syndrome, by 25% for
grade 3 non-hematologic toxicities and by 50% for grade
4 non-hematologic toxicities, and by 25% for a delay in
hematologic recovery of �1 week (excluding anemia).
The oxaliplatin dose was reduced by 25% for grade 3 or 4
hematologic toxicities (excluding anemia), grade 3 or 4
nonhematologic toxicities (excluding hand-foot syn-
drome), a delay in hematologic recovery of �1 week (ex-
cluding anemia), or paresthesias with pain or functional
impairment of �7 days. Oxaliplatin was discontinued if
paresthesias with pain or functional impairment persisted
throughout a cycle. Patients were allowed to continue on
the study after discontinuation of oxaliplatin. Two dose
reductions were allowed for capecitabine and oxaliplatin.
If a third reduction was required, the patient was removed
from the study. There were no dose adjustments for
bevacizumab.
Statistical Analysis
The primary endpoint was PFS at 6 months. PFS was de-
fined as the interval between the initiation of treatment
and the date of first documentation of disease progression
or symptomatic deterioration or death due to any cause. A
previous study with 25 patients who were treated with
CAPOX alone demonstrated a PFS rate at 6 months of
52%.4 The accrual goal for the current study was 30
patients. This sample size ensured that, if the trial was not
terminated early, a posterior 90% confidence interval
(90% CI) of PFS at 6 months would be 0.52 to 0.79, as-
suming that the PFS at 6 months would be 0.67 (20 out
of 30 patients) with the new treatment.
Secondary endpoints included response rate (RR),
overall PFS, overall survival (OS), and toxicity. Responses
were determined according to RECIST criteria in all
evaluable patients. Toxicity data were analyzed in all
patients who received at least 1 dose of the study medica-
tion. For the unplanned exploratory analysis, we analyzed
historical data from the metastatic cohort (25 patients)
from our previous CAPOX study.4 Both sets of patients,
current and historical, had metastatic disease.
OS was defined as the time from the first study treat-
ment to the date of death or last follow-up. Comparisons
were conducted using the Wilcoxon rank sum test, Fisher
exact test, or log-rank test. Kaplan-Meier curves were used
to estimate unadjusted OS and PFS time distributions.
All computations were performed using SAS statistical
software (version 9.4; SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC) and
TIBCO Spotfire S 1 (version 8.2; TIBCO Software Inc,
Palo Alto, Calif).
RESULTS
Between August 2011 and November 2014, a total of 30
patients with advanced SBA or AAC were enrolled. The
baseline characteristics of the study population are listed
in Table 1. The median age of the study population was
63 years. Of the 30 patients, 23 (77%) had SBA (18 of du-
odenal origin and 5 of jejunal/ileal origin) whereas 7
patients (23%) had AAC (5 of pancreatobiliary subtype, 1
of intestinal subtype, and 1 of mixed subtype). Poorly dif-
ferentiated histology was present in 60% of patients and
mucinous histology was present in 16.7%. Inflammatory
bowel disease was present in 1 patient, whereas none of
the patients had a known history of Lynch syndrome.
Outcomes related to the efficacy of this regimen are
listed in Table 2. The primary endpoint for the current
study was PFS at 6 months. The probability of PFS at 6
months with the combination of CAPOX and bevacizu-
mab was 68% (95% CI, 52%-88%; 90% CI, 54%-84%).
Secondary endpoints included overall RR (ORR), overall
PFS, and OS. The ORR was 48.3% with 1 complete

 response (CR) and 13 partial responses (PRs). Ten
patients had stable disease (SD). The 1 unevaluable
patient received 1 cycle of the study treatment for meta-
static duodenal adenocarcinoma, but due to the develop-
ment of duodenal obstruction and biliary obstruction
with a subsequent decline in performance status, the pa-
tient was deemed not to be a candidate for additional che-
motherapy. Figure 1 depicts a waterfall plot of best tumor
response as per RECIST criteria. The patient with a CR
was diagnosed with AAC of pancreatobiliary subtype and
achieved a CR in multiple liver metastases after 12 cycles
of CAPOX and bevacizumab and remained in CR for an
additional 10 months. A second patient with duodenal
adenocarcinoma developed radiographic resolution of ex-
tensive mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy
but due to an elevated tumor marker was categorized as
having achieved a PR and remained on study at the time
of last follow-up, 15 months from the initiation of the
study. The RR was similar between patients with SBA
(50%) and those with AAC (43%). Of the 5 patients with
AAC of pancreatobiliary subtype, 1 patient achieved a CR
as noted above, another patient achieved a PR, and the
remaining 3 patients had SD as their best response to
treatment with CAPOX and bevacizumab. The best
response achieved by the patient with AAC of intestinal
subtype was a PR and the best response achieved by the
patient with AAC of mixed subtype was SD.
At a median follow-up of 25.9 months, the median
PFS was 8.7 months (95% CI, 4.9-10.5 months; 90% CI,
6.5-10.3 months) and the median OS was 12.9 months
(95% CI, 9.2-19.7 months; 90% CI, 10.5-17.2 months)
(Fig. 2) (Table 2). At the time of last follow-up, 3 patients
remained on the current study.
The most common treatment-related grade 1 to 4
adverse events are listed in Table 3. Treatment was well
tolerated, with the most common grade 3 toxicities being

 fatigue (7 patients; 23%), hypertension (7 patients; 23%),
neutropenia (6 patients; 20%), and diarrhea (3 patients;
10%). Common grade 2 toxicities were anorexia (15
patients; 50%), fatigue (14 patients; 47%), and nausea (11
patients; 37%). Only one grade 4 toxicity occurred; this
patient developed grade 4 neutropenia after 8 cycles of treat-
ment. There were no treatment-related deaths reported.
An exploratory analysis comparing the current study
with the metastatic cohort of 25 patients from our prior
phase 2 CAPOX study4 was performed. As shown in
Supporting Information Table 1, there were no signifi-
cant differences noted with regard to the baseline charac-
teristics of the study populations involved in both studies.
Statistical analysis demonstrated no significant difference
in the RR (48.3% vs 52%; P 5 .79) or PFS (8.7 months
vs 6.6 months; hazard ratio [HR], 1.125; 95% CI, 0.585-
2.163 [P 5 .73]) between treatment with CAPOX with
bevacizumab versus CAPOX alone (see Supporting Infor-
mation Fig. 1).
DISCUSSION
In the current study, we demonstrated that the combina-
tion of CAPOX with bevacizumab is an active regimen,
with an ORR of 48.3%, a median PFS of 8.7 months, and
a median OS of 12.9 months. Treatment was well tolerat-
ed, with the most common grade 3 toxicities reported to
be fatigue (23%), hypertension (23%), neutropenia
(20%), and diarrhea (10%). The findings of the current
study demonstrate that CAPOX with bevacizumab is a
safe and efficacious combination for patients with ad-
vanced SBA or AAC. To the best of our knowledge, the
current study is the first prospective clinical trial to date
evaluating the use of targeted therapies in patients with
SBA and AAC.
Based on phase 2 clinical trials and retrospective
data, the standard first-line treatment regimen for patients
with SBA is a combination of a fluoropyrimidine and oxa-
liplatin.3-6 The results from phase 2 studies of CAPOX
and FOLFOX appear similar, with response rates of 39%
to 52% and a median PFS of 7.8 to 11.3 months
reported.4,6 Recently, the addition of irinotecan to
CAPOX was explored, resulting in a median PFS of 8.7
months and a median OS of 12.7 months.5 The results
from the current study appear to be similar to those of
these prior studies. In addition, toxicity was similar to that
reported in prior studies with this treatment combination
and, despite the presence of intact small bowel primary
tumors in approximately 60% of the study patients, there
were no episodes of bowel perforation reported.
Given its rarity and proximity to the large bowel,
SBA often has been treated in a similar manner to CRC.2
However, there are several epidemiological and molecular
differences between SBA and CRC. According to Surveil-
lance, Epidemiology, and End Results program data, stage
IV disease is present in 32% of SBA cases, in contrast to
20% of CRC cases.13 Furthermore, poor differentiation is
present in 33% of SBA cases, in contrast to 21% of CRC
cases.13 The incidence of these malignancies is diverging,
with the incidence of SBA increasing and that of CRC de-
clining in the United States2; however, it should be noted
that there is no routine screening for SBA and AAC
whereas there are strict screening guidelines for CRC. In
addition, recent work has demonstrated that the stage-
stratified, cancer-specific survival rate was worse for
patients with SBA than for those with CRC.13 Although

 less is known regarding the molecular basis of SBA, the
rate of APC mutations is markedly less, ranging from 7%
to 13%, in contrast to 60% to 68% in CRC.2 SMAD4
mutations are more common in patients with SBA (30%)
compared with those with CRC (5%-16%).2 BRAF
V600E mutations are very rare in individuals with SBA,
with 1 study finding no BRAF mutations among 99
cases.14 The rate of KRAS mutations (codons 12 and 13)
in patients with SBA (40%-60%) is comparable to that in
patients with CRC.2 Taken together, such fundamental
differences support continued efforts to better understand
this malignancy and determine the optimal treatment
approach.
An exploratory analysis comparing the current study
with a preceding phase 2 clinical trial of CAPOX alone in
patients with SBA and AAC that was conducted at the
same institution demonstrated no significant difference in
RR or PFS. However, it is important to note that both
studies enrolled a limited number of patients and were
not designed or powered to detect differences between the
2 regimens. The benefit of the addition of bevacizumab to
chemotherapy in patients with CRC has been demon-
strated in several large randomized trials. The most recent
international phase 3 clinical trial (NO16966) comparing
bevacizumab or placebo combined with FOLFOX/
CAPOX in the first-line setting demonstrated that the ad-
dition of bevacizumab improved outcome, with a median
PFS of 9.4 months with bevacizumab compared with
8 months with placebo (HR, 0.83; P 5 .0023).11 The me-
dian OS was 21.3 months in the group receiving bevacizu-
mab and 19.9 months in the placebo group (HR, 0.89;
P 5 .077). RRs were similar in both arms: 47% in the
bevacizumab group and 49% in the placebo group
(P 5 .31). It is interesting to note that, to the best of our
knowledge, phase 3 clinical trials in gastric cancer have
not demonstrated a benefit with the addition of bevacizu-
mab. The AVAGAST phase 3 clinical trial comparing
bevacizumab or placebo combined with cisplatin/capeci-
tabine in the first-line setting failed to meet its primary
endpoint, with a median OS of 12.1 months reported
with bevacizumab compared with 10.1 months noted
with placebo (HR, 0.87; P 5 .1002).15 The median PFS
was significantly improved from 5.3 months with placebo
to 6.7 months with bevacizumab (HR, 0.80; P 5 .0037).
The RR also was found to be significantly improved from
37.4%
with
placebo
to
46%
with
bevacizumab
(P 5 .0315). The results from this study, taken together
with data from other studies of alimentary tract adenocar-
cinomas, suggest the rationale for the further evaluation
of VEGF targeting in patients with SBA and AAC.
However, further investigation will require large multi-
center efforts to provide the needed comparative data
within this disease type.
The results of the current study demonstrate the fea-
sibility of completing prospective clinical trials of novel
targeted agents in patients with orphan tumor types. Al-
though the current study findings have suggested a novel
combination therapy for this rare malignancy, they also
raise an important question regarding the usefulness of
costly targeted therapies in a population of patients for
whom there are no randomized clinical trials. Recent suc-
cessful efforts to target rare subsets of common tumors
support the potential for improved clinical trial enroll-
ment for patients with rare cancers. However, currently,
oncologists and the patients they treat must rely on phase
2 clinical trials to guide treatment decisions.
The combination of CAPOX and bevacizumab
appears to be an efficacious and well-tolerated regimen in
patients with SBA and AAC. Toxicities were limited, and
there were no treatment-related deaths reported. Further
exploration of antiangiogenic approaches in individuals
with SBA and AAC is warranted.
