SUMMARY
Development of disease-modifying therapeutics is
urgently needed for treating Alzheimer disease (AD).
AD is characterized by toxic b-amyloid (Ab) peptides
produced by b- and g-secretase-mediated cleavage
of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). b-secretase
inhibitors reduce Ab levels, but mechanism-based
side effects arise because they also inhibit b-cleav-
age of non-amyloid substrates like Neuregulin. We
report that b-secretase has a higher affinity for Neure-
gulin than it does for APP. Kinetic studies demon-
strate that the affinities and catalytic efficiencies of
b-secretase are higher toward non-amyloid sub-
strates than toward APP. We show that non-amyloid
substrates are processed by b-secretase in an
endocytosis-independent manner. Exploiting this
compartmentalization of substrates, we specifically
target the endosomal b-secretase by an endosomally
targeted b-secretase inhibitor, which blocked cleav-
age of APP but not non-amyloid substrates in many
cell systems, including induced pluripotent stem
cell (iPSC)-derived neurons. b-secretase inhibitors
can be designed to specifically inhibit the Alzheimer
process, enhancing their potential as AD therapeu-
tics without undesired side effects.
INTRODUCTION
Alzheimer disease (AD) is associated with extracellular deposits
of b-amyloid (Ab) peptide (De Strooper, 2010; Hardy and
Higgins, 1992; Tanzi, 2005), which is generated by proteolytic
processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the b-sec-
retase BACE1 (Hussain et al., 1999; Sinha et al., 1999; Vassar
et al., 1999; Yan et al., 1999) and g-secretase. Mutations within
the b-cleavage sites of APP can increase the risk for familial
forms of AD (Citron et al., 1992; Thinakaran et al., 1996; Zhou
et al., 2011) or confer protection against cognitive decline in
the elderly (Jonsson et al., 2012), causatively linking BACE1 to
AD. Moreover, because of the failure in recent clinical trials of
g-secretase inhibition, mainly because of mechanism-based
side effects in humans, BACE1 is considered the preferred
drug target (Vassar and Kandalepas, 2011). BACE1 is an attrac-
tive therapeutic target for AD. However, complete abolishment
of BACE1 activity is associated with specific behavioral and
physiological alterations in mice (Cai et al., 2012; Cheret et al.,
2013; Hitt et al., 2012; Kim et al., 2007; Lahiri et al., 2014; Li
and S€
udhof, 2004). These alterations may arise from the failure
to process some non-amyloid BACE1 substrates such as
NRG1, which is involved in axonal myelination of neurons (Hu
et al., 2006, 2010; Ma et al., 2007; Willem et al., 2006); immuno-
globulin (Ig)-containing b1 Nrg1 (IgNrg1b1) (Cheret et al., 2013);
the b2 subunit voltage-gated sodium channel (Nav1b2) (Kim
et al., 2007; Wong et al., 2005); and axon guidance molecules,
including CHL1 (Rajapaksha et al., 2011) and L1 (Zhou et al.,
2012), Jagged (Hu et al., 2013), b-galactoside a 2, 6-sialyltrans-
ferase (ST6GalI) (Kitazume et al., 2005; Sugimoto et al., 2007),
APLP1 and APLP2 (Li and S€
udhof, 2004), lipoprotein receptor-
related protein (LRP) (von Arnim et al., 2005), interleukin 1 recep-
tor II (IL-1R2, but not tumor necrosis factor a [TNF-a]) (Kuhn
et al., 2007, 2012), and vascular endothelial growth factor recep-
tor 1 (VEGFR1) (Cai et al., 2012). Therefore, a general BACE1
inhibitor might block cleavage of non-amyloid substrates,
decreasing its value as an AD therapeutic drug (Cai et al.,
2012; Cheret et al., 2013; Hitt et al., 2012; Kim et al., 2007; Lahiri
et al., 2014; Li and S€
udhof, 2004).

 In the cell, proteins are distributed to multiple subcellular loca-
tions (Mellman and Nelson, 2008). Spatial distribution of proteins
is crucial for spatial cellular functions (Rajendran and Simons,
2005). In polarized cells such as neurons, cellular distribution
of proteins allows temporal and spatial control of diverse cellular
functions. Many cellular proteins show multiple subcellular loca-
tions, such as BACE1. BACE1 is located in the trans-Golgi
network (TGN) (Yan et al., 2001), plasma membrane (Walter
et al., 2001a, 2001b), and early endosomes (Rajendran et al.,
2006) and in polarized cells such as neurons because these cells
also display compartmentalization of BACE1 in axons versus so-
matodendritic compartments (Buggia-Pre
´ vot et al., 2014; Vassar
et al., 2014). BACE1 cleaves APP in early endosomes after endo-
cytosis (Rajendran et al., 2006). Both the enzyme and the sub-
strate undergo endocytosis, presumably through different
routes, and meet in early endosomes for processing (Rajendran
et al., 2006; Sannerud et al., 2011; Schneider et al., 2008).
Currently it is unknown whether non-amyloid substrates such
as NRG1 or L1 are processed in the endosomal compartment
or other compartments. Selectively inhibiting the activity of
BACE1 in a particular subcellular compartment, early endo-
somes, where it cleaves APP, could be an effective therapeutic
strategy provided the other substrates are cleaved in non-endo-
somal compartments. Therefore, in this work, we explored the
compartmentalization
of
BACE1
substrate
processing
to
address the feasibility of targeting BACE1 for inhibition in the
subcellular compartment, where it cleaves the APP substrate.
We studied the expression profiles of BACE1 substrates.
Indeed, RT-PCR analysis of many BACE1 substrates, including
APP and NRG1, revealed their expression throughout the mouse
lifespan (Figure S1A), suggesting that general BACE1 inhibition
could affect the processing of both amyloid and non-amyloid
substrates at all stages. Whether an inhibitor could be developed
to specifically target APP cleavage and, thereby, minimize non-
specific side effects is currently unclear. We explored the possi-
bility of specifically inhibiting b-cleavage of APP, but not that of
non-amyloid substrates, by assessing its distinct structural,
biochemical and, cellular requirements.
RESULTS
Molecular Dynamics Simulations Suggest that NRG1 Is a
Better Substrate Than WT APP for BACE1
To characterize BACE1 interaction with non-amyloid versus am-
yloid substrates, we designed eight-residue P4-P40 peptides as
substrates based on the BACE1 binding regions from wild-type
(WT) APP, NRG1, and P-selectin glycoprotein ligand 1 (PSGL1,
[SELPLG1]) for structural and biochemical analyses (Figure S1B;
Hu et al., 2006; Lichtenthaler et al., 2003; Willem et al., 2006). The
corresponding peptide sequence derived from the Swedish
mutant of the amyloid precursor protein (swAPP), a familial mu-
tation that causes early-onset AD (Citron et al., 1992) and differs
by only two residues from WT APP and binds BACE1 better, was
used as a positive control (Hong et al., 2000). The corresponding
substrate analog inhibitors were derived by replacing the scissile
peptide bond with an isostere moiety, which renders the peptide
bond non-cleavable.
To this end, we first performed explicit solvent molecular dy-
namics (MD) simulations of the BACE1/substrate complexes
(Figures 1A and 1B; Figure S1C) and BACE1/substrate analog
inhibitors (Figure S2A) based on the BACE1-OM99 inhibitor
complex (Hong et al., 2000). The ensemble-averaged interaction
energies and their electrostatic and van der Waals contributions
were determined. We found that the overall plasticity of the
BACE1 protein was essentially the same in all MD runs irrespec-
tive of the substrate to which it was bound (Figure S2). As antic-
ipated, the interaction energy for BACE1 with swAPP was more
favorable than with WT APP (Barman et al., 2011; Hong et al.,
2000; Figure 1B).
Unexpectedly, MD simulations indicated that BACE1 interacts
more favorably with the non-amyloid substrate NRG1 than with
either amyloid substrate (Figure 1B). Furthermore, a higher affin-
ity of BACE1 for NRG1 than WT APP and swAPP was also
observed in MD simulations carried out with the substrate analog
inhibitors (Figure S2). The range of values of the electrostatic
contribution for the four different substrates was about an order
of magnitude larger than the van der Waals range (400 kcal/mol
versus 40 kcal/mol, respectively) and therefore dominated the
variation in the total interaction energy (which is the sum of these
two terms). The individual contributions of each of the P4-P40 res-
idues of the substrates showed that the Glu residues at (P2) and
(P20) of NRG1 are involved in more favorable interactions with
BACE1 than the corresponding residues in WT APP and PSGL1
(Figures 1A and 1C; Figure S1C). We observed that this could
be due to salt bridge interactions of the P2 and P20 Glu residues
in NRG1 with Arg235 and Arg128 of BACE1, respectively (Fig-
ure 1A). This observation suggested that the replacement of the
acidic Glu to a basic amino acid in the substrate would be unfa-
vorable because this will inhibit the formation of the electrostatic
interaction between the substrate and the enzyme. Indeed, in WT
APP, a Lys residue is present at the (P2) position, which creates
an unfavorable interaction with BACE1, presumably because of
the proximity of the side chain of Arg235 (Figure 1A).
To ascertain the individual contributions of the P2 and P20 Glu
side chains of NRG1, simulations were carried out with mutants
containing Lys instead of Glu at both sites or only at (P2). The
interaction energy of the single (P2) mutant was weakened
almost as much as for the double mutant, which suggests that
the Glu at (P2) site alone contributes significantly to the interac-
tion with BACE1 and much more than the Glu at (P20) (Figure 1C).
Further, we replaced the Lys at (P2) in WT APP with Glu and
found that this substitution conferred a higher affinity for
BACE1 (Figure 1B). Therefore, position (P2) strongly affects the
substrate affinity for BACE1 through the formation of favorable
(NRG1) or unfavorable (WT APP) interactions (Figure 1C). These
results also revealed additional information: it is the presence of
the (P2) Lys that renders WT APP a weaker substrate rather than
the acquisition of the dipeptide segment Asn-Leu at (P2)-(P1),
which makes the Swedish mutant of APP a better substrate (Fig-
ure 1C; Figure S2; Barman et al., 2011; Hong et al., 2000). Inter-
estingly, another non-amyloid substrate, L1, also harbors a
similar acidic amino acid (Glu) and may potentially interact with
the Arg235 in BACE1 (Zhou et al., 2012).
Therefore, MD simulations of BACE1 binding to amyloid as
well as the non-amyloid substrate NRG1 uncovered the
2128

 importance of the critical acidic residue (P2) Glu of NRG1 in
conferring a stable interaction with BACE1.
In Vitro Fluorescence Experiments Demonstrate that
NRG1 Is a Better Substrate Than APP
To experimentally test the predictions of MD simulations and to
evaluate the potency of amyloid and non-amyloid substrate
analog inhibitors, we used the cell-free fluorescence resonance
energy transfer (FRET)-based BACE1 activity assay (Ermolieff
et al., 2000). We quantified the effect of the different substrate
analog
inhibitors
on
BACE1
cleavage
of
a
fluorophore
quencher-labeled, WT-APP-based peptide FRET reporter (Fig-
ure 2A; Figure S3). As a positive control for inhibition, we used
the BACE1 inhibitor C3. We found that the NRG1-derived inhib-
itor reduced BACE1 cleavage with comparable efficiency to that
of an swAPP-derived inhibitor (Figure 2A), confirming the simula-
tion predictions. In contrast, the WT APP-derived inhibitor was
less effective at reducing BACE1 activity, and the PSGL1-based
inhibitor resembled that of control condition with no inhibition of
the fluorescence readouts (Figure 2A). Similar results were ob-
tained with a fluorophore quencher-labeled, NRG1-based pep-
tide FRET reporter (Figure 2B). Therefore, at least in vitro,
BACE1 binds NRG1 with a higher affinity than WT APP.
The (P2) Glu Residue in the Binding Site of NRG1 Confers
High-Affinity Binding to BACE1
To understand whether BACE1 not only binds but also cleaves
NRG1 better than WT APP, we determined the hydrolytic

 efficiency of BACE1 for the amyloid and non-amyloid substrates
and used swAPP as a positive control. We calculated KM and kcat
values to determine the affinity and cleavage efficiencies,
respectively, with specificity defined by kcat/KM values. The affin-
ity of BACE1 for NRG1 was twice that for WT APP (KM of 19.6 ±
2.8 mM and 36.6 ± 3.6 mM, respectively). As predicted, swAPP
displayed a low KM value of 5.2 m± 1.2 mM. BACE1 cleaved WT
APP with the lowest specificity, represented by a kcat/KM value
of 57.8 ± 5.9 M�1 S�1, whereas it cleaved NRG1 with a specificity
of 570 ± 80 M�1 S�1, which is 10-fold higher than WT APP. In
contrast, swAPP was cleaved with the highest specificity of
4,800 ± 1,200 M�1 S�1 (Figure 2C; Figure S4). Finally, compared
with WT APP, the catalytic efficiency of BACE1 was approxi-
mately five times higher for NRG1 and ten times higher for
swAPP. Therefore, NRG1 is a better substrate for BACE1 than
WT APP.
Because MD simulations suggested that NRG1 binds BACE1
with higher affinity, and because this is most likely due to the (P2)
Glu residue in NRG1, we wanted to verify this experimentally. We
replaced the (P2) Glu residue of NRG1 with a Lys residue (NRG1
E(P2)K) to mimic WT APP (P2) and found that this substitution
reduced the rate of cleavage by BACE1 (Figure 2D). On the other
hand, exchanging the Lys residue of WT APP (P2) for a Glu res-
idue (WT APP K(P2)E) increased the rate of cleavage (Figure 2E).
Therefore, the (P2) Glu residue of NRG1 makes it a significantly
better substrate for BACE1 than WT APP both in terms of binding
and cleavage efficiency.
To evaluate the importance of the residue at (P2) for cleavage
by BACE1 in the cellular context, we replaced the Lys with Glu at
this position in WT APP and transfected this construct into HEK
cells stably expressing BACE1. Consistent with the in vitro re-
sults, this substitution conferred increased Ab production (Fig-
ure 2F). Interestingly, replacement of the (P2) Lys with a smaller,
non-charged Ala residue also increased Ab production (Fig-
ure 2F) suggesting that a Lys residue at (P2) interferes with the
binding to BACE1, as suggested by the MD simulations. Substi-
tution of (P2) Lys with another basic amino acid, Arg, did not alter
Ab levels (Figure 2F). On the other hand, substitution of the (P2)
Glu in NRG1 with the basic residue Lys but not with another
acidic residue, Asp, dramatically decreased its cleavage by
BACE1 in cells (Figure 2G). C3 inhibited processing of all mutants
(Figure 2G), demonstrating that their cleavages are BACE-
dependent. Therefore, these data unequivocally demonstrate
that the Glu residue in the cleavage site of NRG1 plays a critical
role in the affinity and cleavage efficiency of BACE1 both in vitro
and in cells.
BACE1 Displays Higher Cleavage Efficiencies toward
Another Non-amyloid Substrate, L1
The non-amyloid substrate of BACE1, L1, also has a Glu residue
in the BACE1 cleavage site (Zhou et al., 2012) and, therefore
could confer a higher affinity to BACE1 binding and cleavage ef-
ficiency. To test this, we evaluated the BACE1 cleavage kinetics
of L1 with and without the critical Glu residue mutated (Fig-
ure 2H). Indeed, similar to NRG1, wild-type L1 was processed
with higher cleavage efficiency than WT APP (Figure 2H). Inter-
estingly, mutating the Glu residue to Lys nearly abolished the
cleavage by BACE1 (Figure 2H). As expected, the cell-perme-
able inhibitor C3 abolished BACE1 cleavage of all substrates.
Therefore, BACE1 has a higher affinity and catalytic efficiency
toward the non-amyloid substrates such as NRG1 and L1 than
toward WT APP.
b-Cleavage of the Non-amyloid Substrates NRG1 and L1
Does Not Require Endocytosis
Despite being a poor substrate (Gr€
uninger-Leitch et al., 2002;
Sauder et al., 2000), and even in the presence of the higher-affin-
ity substrates, APP is cleaved in the cellular context and also
in vivo. We hypothesized that BACE1 cleaves different sub-
strates in distinct subcellular compartments. For instance, previ-
ous work has shown that swAPP, which has a higher affinity for
BACE1, is cleaved by b-secretase in the biosynthetic compart-
ments (Haass et al., 1995; Thinakaran et al., 1996), whereas

 cleavage of WT APP occurs in endosomes (Carey et al., 2005;
Koo and Squazzo, 1994; Rajendran and Annaert, 2012; Rajen-
dran et al., 2006; Udayar et al., 2013). Because our findings
show that NRG1 also has a higher affinity for BACE1 than WT
APP, we hypothesized that NRG1 might also be processed inde-
pendent of endocytosis. To determine whether b-cleavage of
NRG1 is similar or different to that of WT APP in terms of its
requirement of endocytosis, we perturbed membrane trafficking
pathways and assessed the b-cleavage of NRG1. Expression of
dominant-negative dynamin (Dyn K44A), a mutant of the GTPase
involved in fission of the endocytic vesicles that inhibits dyna-
min-dependent endocytosis, did not inhibit the cleavage of
NRG1 (Figure 3A). Similarly, pharmacological inhibition of cla-
thrin-dependent/clathrin-independent endocytosis using Pit-
stop2 (Dutta et al., 2012; Stahlschmidt et al., 2014; von Kleist
et al., 2011), an inhibitor that inhibits clathrin-mediated endocy-
tosis and clathrin-independent endocytosis, did not inhibit the
cleavage of NRG1 (Figure 3A). However, both treatments signif-
icantly inhibited b-cleavage of APP and Ab production (Fig-
ure 3B). Pitstop2 had a more pronounced effect on Ab than
secreted APPb (sAPPb), probably because of the inhibition of
g-secretase internalization as well as inhibition of BACE1 endo-
cytosis. Control experiments showed that, indeed, treatment of
cells with Pitstop2 (Figure 3C) or cells expressing Dynamin
K44A inhibited endocytosis of Transferrin (Figures 3C and 3D)
and epidermal growth factor (EGF) (Figure 3C), two clathrin/dy-
namin-dependent cargoes. Therefore, unlike APP, NRG1 does
not require endocytosis for cleavage by BACE1.
Consistent with these observations and similar to NRG1, L1
was also cleaved by BACE1 in an endocytosis-independent
manner (Figure 3E) suggesting that unlike APP, the other physi-
ologically relevant substrates may not require dynamin/clathrin
endocytosis for their b-cleavages and providing further support
to the idea that BACE1 cleaves these higher affinity substrates
in an endocytosis-independent manner.
The Endosomally Targeted, Sterol-Linked BACE1
Inhibitor Inhibits Ab Production and Cleavage of APP
without Affecting b-Cleavage of NRG1 and L1
Exploiting the observation that different membrane trafficking
pathways differentially regulate b-cleavage of APP and NRG1
or L1, we tested whether inhibiting BACE1 activity specifically
in the endosomal compartment would inhibit b-cleavage of
APP and, thereby, spare the cleavage of the non-amyloid sub-
strates NRG1 and L1. We found that the cell-permeable pan in-
hibitor C3 substantially inhibited b-cleavage of NRG1 in cells,
whereas an endosomally targeted, sterol-linked BACE1 inhibitor
(Rajendran et al., 2008) showed no significant inhibition of NRG1
b-cleavage (Figures 4A and 4B). However, both treatments in-
hibited b-cleavage of WT APP and Ab production (Figure 4C).
Similar results were obtained in primary mouse neuronal cul-
tures, where an endosomally targeted, sterol-linked inhibitor of
b-secretase spared cleavage of NRG1 but not of APP (Figure S5)
under an endogenous BACE1 expression level.
Similar to NRG1, we then tested whether BACE1-mediated
cleavage of L1, which also did not require endocytosis, could
be spared by using the endosomally targeted, sterol-linked
BACE1 inhibitor. Treatment with the endosomally targeted, ste-
rol-linked BACE1 inhibitor did not affect b-cleavage of L1,
whereas treatment with the general cell-permeable BACE1 in-
hibitor C3 abolished almost all BACE1 processing (Figures 4D
and 4E). In control experiments performed with APP, b-cleavage
of WT APP was inhibited completely by both the endosomally
targeted, sterol-linked BACE1 inhibitor and the general cell-
permeable inhibitor (Figure 4C).
The Endosomally Targeted, Sterol-Linked BACE1
Inhibitor Inhibits NRG1 Processing When Subcellular
Compartmentalization Is Compromised
To test whether the endosomally targeted, sterol-linked BACE1
inhibitor can indeed inhibit NRG1 processing when the integrity
of
subcellular
compartmentalization
is
compromised,
we
tested the effect of both BACE1 inhibitors: the endosomally
targeted, sterol-linked inhibitor and the cell-permeable pan in-
hibitor C3 on solubilized membranes and assessed inhibition
of NRG1 cleavage. Under these conditions, where cellular
compartmentalization is compromised, both the endosomally
targeted, sterol-linked BACE1 inhibitor and C3 significantly
blocked BACE1 cleavage of NRG1 (Figure 5A). These results
suggest that subcellular compartmentalization
of different
substrates in endosomal and non-endosomal compartments
contributes to the differential processing of these substrates
by BACE1.
Among the non-endosomal compartments that harbor b-sec-
retase activity, the TGN and the plasma membrane have been
suggested to be places for b-secretase activity (Li and S€
udhof,
2004; Prabhu et al., 2012). To investigate whether the processing
of NRG1 by BACE1 occurs at the cell surface, we used a cell-
impermeable BACE1 inhibitor, GL189 (Capell et al., 2002), and
tested its inhibitory potential on BACE1 cleavage of NRG1.
This inhibitor is a substrate analog transition state inhibitor that
has been demonstrated to bind to active BACE1 in solubilized
membrane fraction assays (Capell et al., 2002). Therefore, we hy-
pothesized that, if active BACE1 is present at the cell surface that
is competent to cleave NRG1, then this cell-impermeable transi-
tion state inhibitor should inhibit BACE1 cleavage of NRG1.
However, treatment of cells expressing NRG1 with GL189
did not inhibit the processing of NRG1 by BACE1 (Figure 5B).
However, the control C3, the cell-permeable BACE1 inhibitor,
almost abolished the processing of NRG1 by BACE1 (Figure 5B).
Similarly, endocytosis inhibition also did not inhibit BACE1 pro-
cessing of NRG1. However, addition of C3 under endocytosis in-
hibition inhibits NRG1 cleavage, demonstrating that NRG1
cleavage occurs neither at the plasma membrane nor in endo-
somes (Figure 5B). As additional controls, we also checked
whether BACE1 cleavage of APP was affected under similar
conditions and found that treatment of cells with the cell-imper-
meable inhibitor GL-189 had no effect on b-cleavage of APP.
However, treatment with the endocytosis inhibitor or cell-perme-
able inhibitor or both inhibited b-cleavage, showing conclusively
that b-cleavage of APP does not occur at the plasma membrane
but is dependent on endocytosis. Taken together, these results
indicate that BACE1 cleaves NRG1 neither at the plasma mem-
brane nor in endosomes but, most likely, at the TGN, the only
other low-pH, non-endo-lysosomal organelle that is conducive
for BACE1 activity.

antibody. Again, note the stabilization of L1 full-length and L1-b-CTF upon Dyn K44A co-transfection, similar to NRG1.

 The Endosomally Targeted, Sterol-Linked BACE1
Inhibitor Inhibits APP Processing without Affecting
NRG1 Processing in iPSC-Derived Human Neurons
To validate the findings regarding the endosomally targeted, ste-
rol-linked BACE1 inhibitor sparing NRG1 cleavage in a more
relevant setting for potential treatment in AD patients, we treated
neurons generated from human induced pluripotent stem cells
(h-iPSCs) derived from healthy human donors (Figure 6A; Fig-
ure S6) with C3, the cell-permeable BACE1 inhibitor, or the endo-
somally targeted, sterol-linked BACE1 inhibitor and assayed for
BACE1 processing of NRG1 and APP (as a control) in those cells.
C3 BACE1 inhibitor treatment inhibited BACE1 processing of
NRG1 (Figures 6B and 6C). Treatment with the endosomally tar-
geted, sterol linked BACE1 inhibitor did not affect the processing
of NRG1 by BACE1 (Figures 6B and 6C). However, upon C3
BACE1 inhibitor and endosomally targeted, sterol-linked inhibi-
tor treatment, both Ab40 and sAPPb were reduced dramatically,
with sAPPa levels increased (Figure 6D).
The Endosomally Targeted, Sterol-Linked BACE1
Inhibitor Is Targeted to Endocytic Compartments but
Not to the Golgi
Consistent with these results, the fluorescently labeled, sterol-
linked inhibitor trafficked to endosomal compartments (Figures
7A and 7B) but not to the trans-Golgi network, where high-affinity
substrates could be cleaved (Haass et al., 1995; Thinakaran
et al., 1996), as judged by the colocalization experiments (Fig-
ure 7C). When incubated on cells, the fluorescently labeled, ste-
rol-linked inhibitor trafficked from the plasma membrane to
EEA1-positive early endosomes (Figure 7A), the compartments
shown previously to be important for b-cleavage of APP, and
then was transported retrogradely to late endosomal/lysosomal
compartments at longer periods of incubation, as demonstrated
by colocalization with Lamp1 (Figure 7B). The endosomally tar-
geted, sterol-linked inhibitor did not traffic to the TGN 30 min
to 1 hr after uptake, as shown by the absence of localization be-
tween the inhibitor and GalT-GFP, a Golgi-resident protein

 (Figure 7C). As a control, Shiga toxin, a TGN-dedicated cargo,
promptly colocalized with GalT-GFP (Figure 7D). This shows
that the endosomally targeted, sterol-linked inhibitor confines it-
self to the endocytic pathway that is involved in Ab production.
Therefore, an endosomally targeted, sterol-linked BACE1 inhib-
itor specifically inhibited APP cleavage, which predominantly oc-
curs in endosomal compartments, and spared the processing of
other substrates (L1 and NRG1) that are cleaved independent of
endocytosis. These results provide strong evidence that inhibi-
tion of BACE1 cleavage of APP is feasible without interfering
with the cleavage of non-amyloid substrates, as shown here
for NRG1 and L1.
Our results suggest that subcellular compartmentalization al-
lows BACE1 to cleave APP in the endosomal compartment
and other non-amyloid substrates in non-endosomal compart-
ments. However, substrates could also be compartmentalized
in different domains at the membrane level. Cell membranes
are not homogenous in their lipid and protein distribution, and
certain lipids, such as cholesterol and sphingolipid, tend to
form dynamic nanoassemblies (Simons and Ikonen, 1997).
Because the endosomally targeted, sterol-linked BACE1 inhibi-
tor not only is endocytosis-competent but can also compart-
mentalize into lipid raft domains, we asked whether the specific
inhibition is due to the fact that only APP cleavage was endocy-
tosis-dependent or because only APP is partitioned into lipid
rafts. Although our endocytosis inhibition experiment clearly
pointed out that the subcellular compartmentalization of sub-
strates is the reason, we tested this possibility if only APP was
partitioned into lipid rafts and if this is the reason for specific in-
hibition with the endosomally targeted, sterol-linked BACE1 in-
hibitor. To this end, we studied the distribution of APP, BACE1,
NRG1, and L1 in detergent-resistant microdomains (DRMs), a
biochemical way of isolating such membrane domains. We iso-
lated DRMs we identified using standard protocols (Rajendran
et al., 2003; Figure S7). Western blot analysis of the lipid rafts re-
vealed that APP and BACE1 strongly localize in those domains
as reported by several groups (Figure S7). In compliance with
our endocytosis inhibition data, we found that both NRG1 and
L1 full-length and C-terminal fragment (CTF) were also localized
in DRMs, similar to APP and BACE1. These results indicate that
lipid raft localization is not the mechanism behind the sparing of
BACE1 processing of NRG1 and L1 by the endosomally tar-
geted, sterol-linked BACE1 inhibitor but, rather, compartmental-
ization into endosomal versus non-endosomal compartments.

 DISCUSSION
Inhibition of BACE1 is being pursued intensively as a therapeutic
target to treat AD, and BACE1 inhibitors are currently in clinical
trials (Vassar et al., 2014). However, mechanism-based toxicity
might arise from inhibition of BACE1. Chemical inhibition of
BACE1 in adult animals has been shown to alter maintenance
of muscle spindles (Cheret et al., 2013) and to impair synaptic
functions (Filser et al., 2015). Therefore, it is essential to consider
other strategies to design more selective BACE1 inhibitors that
specifically inhibit APP cleavage and Ab production. In this
work, we explored the differential subcompartmentalization of
substrate processing as a strategy to increase the selectivity of
BACE1 inhibitors. We show that the cleavage of high-affinity,
non-amyloid substrates by BACE1 does not require dynamin/
clathrin-mediated endocytosis, whereas processing of APP
does. Our results point to the importance of the acidic residue
in the BACE1 binding site of the substrate at the P2 position.
Even before BACE1 was identified, Citron et al. (1995) predicted
the importance of the P2 residue in APP, and we now show that,
for non-amyloid substrates, the presence of an acidic residue
confers high-affinity binding. This may be a mechanism used
by BACE1 to be able to process its high- and low-affinity sub-
strates in different compartments; namely, non-amyloid sub-
strates in the non-endosomal compartments such as the TGN
and APP in endosomes. An alternative explanation could be
the protonation of the Glu residues in NRG1/L1 in low pH of
the endosomes that inhibits its cleavage in endosomes, which
could also explain why swAPP cleavage by BACE1, which
does not have the Glu residue in this position, is still partly
dependent on endocytosis.
One other possibility is that APP is cleaved in the endosomal
compartment that is regulated by clathrin and/or dynamin,
whereas other substrates are cleaved in a still unidentified endo-
somal compartment that is independent of clathrin/dynamin.
However, our observations point out the existence of distinct
subcellular compartments where APP and other physiological
substrates are cleaved by BACE1. Exploiting this differential
subcellular compartmentalization of BACE1 processing, we spe-
cifically targeted WT APP processing with an endosomally tar-
geted, sterol-linked BACE1 inhibitor. Although the design of
the inhibitor to target endosomal BACE1 has been described
previously (Rajendran et al., 2008), our data show the utility of
this inhibitor as a tool to distinguish BACE1 cleavage of APP

 and non-amyloid substrates because of the subcellular compart-
mentalization of these cleavages. An alternative possibility for
the mode of action of the endosomally targeted, sterol-linked
BACE1 inhibitor is that the endosomally targeted inhibitor,
because of its sterol linkage, targets APP cleavage that occurs
in lipid rafts of endosomes (Ehehalt et al., 2003) and, therefore,
spares non-amyloid substrates that could be localized in non-
raft domains in the endosomes. However, for this to occur,
NRG1 processing must be endocytosis-dependent, and its
processing should occur in non-raft domains of endosomes.
By using Pitstop2, an inhibitor of clathrin-dependent and -inde-
pendent endocytosis (Dutta et al., 2012; Stahlschmidt et al.,
2014; von Kleist et al., 2011), and also with dominant-negative
dynamin, we clearly demonstrate that, although APP processing
by BACE1 requires endocytosis, b-cleavage of the non-amyloid
substrates NRG1 and L1 does not require endocytosis. This sug-
gests that the NRG1/L1-sparing activity of the endosomally
targeted, sterol-linked BACE1 inhibitor is most likely due to en-
dosomal targeting and not due to differential localization of these
non-amyloid substrates in non-raft domains of the endosomes.
Moreover, in our experiments with isolated DRMs, all substrates
are localized in DRMs as well. Therefore, our results point out
that only APP b-cleavage occurs in endosomes and, therefore,
encourages the possibility that endosomally targeted BACE1
therapeutic substances can reduce Ab production without
affecting other BACE1 substrate cleavages. Endosomally tar-
geted BACE1 inhibitors are potential therapeutic substances
for the specific treatment of AD without adverse effects.
The limitations of our study include the lack of translation in an-
imal models because these are beyond the scope of this study,
but our experiments on human iPSCs provides hope. Clearly,
further research is needed to translate these findings in experi-
mental animals and also patients. Regardless, our work demon-
strates that inhibiting Ab production without affecting BACE1
processing of other substrates is possible and of important clin-
ical value for the specific treatment of AD.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
MD Simulations
For the MD simulations, the initial structure of the BACE1-substrate complex
was obtained from the crystal structure of the ecotodomain of BACE1 bound
to the OM99-2 inhibitor (Glu-Val-Asn-Leu-4[CHOH-CH2]-Ala-Ala-Glu-Phe),
where 4[CHOH-CH2] represents a hydroxyethylene isostere of the peptide
bond (PDB: 1FKN) (Hong et al., 2000). The hydroxyethylene isostere was re-
placed by a carbonyl group to obtain the peptide bond and all MD simulations
were carried out with peptide substrates. The OM99-2 inhibitor corresponds to
the swAPP sequence with the Asp(P10)Ala mutation. The original form of the
swAPP sequence was obtained by mutating Ala at P10 of OM99-2 to Asp.
From the structure of the swAPP substrate, the initial structures of WT APP
(Glu-Val-Lys-Met-Asp-Ala-Glu-Phe),
NRG1
(Gly-Ile-Glu-Phe-Met-Glu-Ala-
Glu), and PSGL1 (Ala-Ser-Asn-Leu-Ser-Val-Asn-Tyr) substrates were ob-
tained by appropriate mutations. The BACE-substrate complexes were
immersed in a cubic water box of size 93 A. The initial structures were equili-
brated for 2-ns and 100-ns MD trajectories were calculated for each of the four
BACE-substrate complexes at constant temperature (300 K) and pressure
(1 atm) employing the NAMD program (Phillips et al., 2005) with the
CHARMM22 force field (MacKerell et al., 1998) and TIP3 potential for water
molecules (Jorgensen et al., 1983). The procedure was repeated for the three
mutants of NRG1, i.e., NRG1 G(P4)E, NRG1 E(P2)K, NRG1 E(P20)K, and the
K(P2)E mutant of WT APP. For each these four mutants, 60 ns MD trajectories
were calculated. Similarly, we performed 60 ns of MD simulations for the four
BACE-inhibitor complexes where the hydroxyethylene isostere of the peptide
bond was retained (data not shown). Here we considered the Ala(P10) residue
of OM99-2 for a direct comparison with in vitro assays. In addition, a 120-ns
MD run was performed for each of the complexes between BACE1 and the
statine-based (hydroxyethylene isostere) inhibitors. The P4-P40 residues
were extracted from the sequences of swAPP (OM99-2 inhibitor), WT APP,
NRG1, and PSGL1, except for the Ala at P10, which was kept as in OM99-2
for all four inhibitors.
Cell-free BACE1 Activity Assay
The cell-free BACE1 activity assay was performed in a final volume of 100 ml in
assay buffer: 50 mM sodium acetate (pH 4.5) and 0.1% Triton X-100. 0.24 mM
of recombinant human BACE1-ectodomain (rhBACE1) (Sigma S4195) was
mixed with 10 mM of each substrate in a flat-bottom black 96-wells plate
(Nunc 237105). The assay was performed at 37 ± 1�C with excitation and emis-
sion wavelengths set at 340 nm and 400 nm, respectively. For cell-free BACE1
activity assay with inhibtors, 0.24 mM of rhBACE1 was incubated with 10 mM of
each inhibitor for 10 min at 37�C in the assay buffer prior to the addition of each
substrate.
Km and Kcat Measurements and Calculations
The specificity of the different substrates for rhBACE1 was kinetically assayed
by measuring the Michaelis constant Km and the limiting rate V, from which the
specificity constant Kcat/Km was calculated. Instability of the enzyme during
assay was assessed with the Selwyn test (Selwyn, 1965). Fluorescence mea-
surements were performed in a final volume of 100 ml using flat bottomed black
96-well plates in a Tecan Infinite M1000Pro microplate reader thermostatted at
37 ± 1�C with excitation and emission wavelengths of 340 nm and 400 nm,
respectively. Readings were performed in kinetic mode for 5 min, during which
time fluorescence increased linearly. For a constant 0.24 mM enzyme concen-
tration, 5 or 6 substrate concentrations covering approximately the range 0.2
to 5 Km, as determined in preliminary experiments, were used. Stock solutions
of the substrates were prepared in pure DMSO, but the concentration of the
organic solvent was kept constant at 1% v/v for all substrate concentrations.
Only for the swAPP substrate, the final DMSO concentration was 2% v/v. The
buffer was 50 mM sodium acetate (pH 4.5) with 0.1% Triton X-100 added. Km
and V were calculated by non-linear regression fitting of the Michaelis-Menten
equation.
Quantitative Measurements of Ab40, sAPPb and sAPPa
Human Ab40, human sAPPb, human sAPPa, and mouse Ab40 were assayed
from supernatants, after centrifugation at 1,000 rpm for 3 min, using the elec-
trochemiluminescence (ECL) assay as described in Bali et al., 2012.
Primary Neuronal Culture, Transduction and Inhibitors Treatments
Mixed cortical/hippocampalneurons were prepared from embryonic day15and
16 mice. In brief, dissociated cells were plated onto 6-well poly-D-lysine-coated

 dishes at a density of �250.000/cm2 and cultured in Neurobasal medium (Invi-
trogen) with B27 supplements (Invitrogen), 2mM L-glutamine, and penicillin/
streptomycin. After 5 days, in vitro neuronal cultures were incubated with lenti-
viral NRG1b1 typeIII or GFP particles for 8 hr.48 hr after transduction, cells were
treated with DMSO or inhibitors (C3, TAPI-1 and the endosomally-targeted ste-
rol-linked BACE1 inhibitor) for 24 hr, as previously described.
iPSC-Derived Neuronal Cultures and Treatment
Human iPSC-derived long-term self-renewing neuroepithelial stem cells
(lt-NES cells) (Mertens et al., 2013) were maintained in DMEM/F12, 2 mM
L-glutamine, 1.6 g/l glucose, 0.1 mg/ml penicillin/streptomycin, N2 supple-
ment (Life Technologies), B27 (1 ml/ml; Life Technologies), and fibroblast
growth factor 2 (FGF2) and epidermal growth factor (EGF; both 10 ng/ml;
Cell Guidance Systems) on tissue culture plates coated with poly-L-orni-
thine/laminin (both Sigma), and passaged every 3 or 4 days. Neuronal differen-
tiation was induced by withdrawal of FGF2 and EGF in differentiation
media (MACS Neuro Medium supplemented with MACS NeuroBrew-21
(1:50; Miltenyi Biotec) and DMEM/ F12 supplemented with N2 mixed at a 1:1
ratio) that was exchanged every other day. C3 BACE1 inhibitor (5 mM), endo-
somally-targeted sterol-linked BACE1 inhibitor (100 nM), or DMSO solvent
control were added to neuronal cultures differentiated for 4 weeks. Cultures
were incubated for 22 hr before supernatant and protein lysates were
collected.
