The arenavirus Lassa causes severe hemorrhagic fever and a significant disease burden in
West Africa every year. The glycoprotein, GPC, is the sole antigen expressed on the viral
surface and the critical target for antibody-mediated neutralization. Here we present the
crystal structure of the trimeric, prefusion ectodomain of Lassa GP bound to a neutralizing
antibody from a human survivor at 3.2-angstrom resolution. The antibody extensively
anchors two monomers together at the base of the trimer, and biochemical analysis
suggests that it neutralizes by inhibiting conformational changes required for entry. This
work illuminates pH-driven conformational changes in both receptor-binding and fusion
subunits of Lassa virus, illustrates the unique assembly of the arenavirus glycoprotein
spike, and provides a much-needed template for vaccine design against these threats to
global health.
L
assa virus (LASV) is the etiologic agent of
Lassa fever, an often-fatal viral hemorrhagic
fever that is endemic in West Africa, with an
estimated 20 to 70% lethality (1, 2). The vi-
rus appears to have extended its geographic
spread (3), and outbreaks in 2016 were accom-
panied by demonstrated human-to-human trans-
mission in Africa and Germany (4). There is no
approved Lassa fever vaccine, and the nucleoside
analog ribavirin and supportive therapy are the
only treatment options currently in use for LASV
infection. Attempts to use convalescent plasma
against LASV have met with variable results (5).
LASV is a member of the arenavirus family, which
includes more than 30 known pathogens that
exist on all populated continents on Earth. The
Old World family of arenaviruses contains LASV;
lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), which
causes febrile illness, neurological disease, and birth
defects with a 2 to 5% seroprevalence in North
America and Europe; and the 80% lethal hem-
orrhagic fever virus Lujo (LUJV), which emerged
in Southern Africa in 2008 (6). Arenaviruses in
the New World category include Machupo virus
(MACV) and Junín virus (JUNV), the causative
agents of Bolivian and Argentinian hemorrhagic
fever, respectively, as well as numerous other agents
such as Sabía and Guanarito.
As the sole antigen on the viral surface, the
arenavirus glycoprotein complex (GPC) is the
primary target of protective humoral immune
responses (7, 8) and a focus for vaccine design
efforts. The virion form of GPC is a trimer of
heterodimers, each containing the receptor-
binding subunit GP1 and the transmembrane,
fusion-mediating subunit GP2 (9). GPC also en-
codes an unusual stable signal peptide (SSP) that
has many critical functions and is retained in the
virion as part of the complex. Specifically, it is
required for proper processing of GPC into the
GP1 and GP2 subunits and modulation of the pH
of infectivity, and it may have additional chap-
erone functions during GPC maturation (10–17).
The GPC precursor is trafficked from the endo-
plasmic reticulum to the Golgi, where it is heavily
N-glycosylated and processed by cellular proteases
[signal peptidase (SPase) SKI1/SP1] into its mature
form, which comprises noncovalently linked GP1,
GP2, and SSP (18). GPC must also interact with
ERGIC-53 in the exocytic pathway in order to
form infectious virions (19).
The GPC trimer on the resulting virion must
engage several host receptors to mediate entry
of target cells. GPC of LASV binds to a xylose–
glucaronic acid sugar, called matriglycan (20);
on a-dystroglycan (a-DG) (21–23); or to alter-
native receptors at the cell surface (24). LASV
then enters the endocytic pathway, where it
binds to lysosome-associated membrane pro-
tein 1 (LAMP1) before membrane fusion (9, 25, 26).
The GPC of pathogenic New World arenaviruses
binds to transferrin receptor 1 (27) as its cel-
lular receptor.
Multiple structures of individual GP1 and GP2
subunits of various arenaviruses have been deter-
mined (28–33), along with a GP1-GP2 complex of
LCMV (34). That structure, however, did not re-
veal the organization of GPC on the arenavirus
surface that is relevant for antibody neutraliza-
tion and vaccine design.
A study of more than 100 antibodies from hu-
man survivors of Lassa fever found that the major-
ity of the neutralizing response to LASV targeted
the quaternary assembly of the prefusion GPC
trimer, rather than either subunit alone (7). Fur-
ther, the majority of the neutralizing response was
contained in a single competition group, termed
GPC-B. Here, we present the 3.2-Å crystal struc-
ture of the prefusion GPC trimer of LASV, in com-
plex with the human neutralizing antibody 37.7H,
which is directed against the quaternary GPC-B
epitope. This structure reveals the first look at
the prefusion arenavirus GP trimer; suggests that
conformational changes occur in the GP1 subunit,
as well as the GP2 subunit upon exposure to low
pH; and illuminates reasons why GPC must be
enzymatically processed to oligomerize and bind
one of its extracellular receptors. It also illuminates
what appears to be the most vulnerable region on
the LASV trimer targeted for antibody-mediated
neutralization and suggests that such antibodies
function by blocking conformational changes re-
quired for binding an intracellular receptor and
for fusion.
Structure determination
Structure determination of an arenavirus GPC
trimer has been previously hindered by meta-
stability of the protein: the propensity of GP1
and GP2 to separate and for GP2 to spring into its
postfusion, six-helix bundle conformation. Mindful
of the success of cysteine-linkage strategies for HIV
and respiratory syncytial virus (35–40), we genet-
ically modified the LASV glycoprotein ectodomain
by (i) making the point mutations R207C and
G360C (41) to covalently link GP1 and GP2 to-
gether, (ii) introduction of a proline via an E329P
mutation in the metastable region of HR1 of GP2,
and (iii) by replacing the native S1P GP1-GP2 cleav-
age site with a furin site (RRLL to RRRR) to en-
able efficient processing of the GP in Drosophila
S2 cells (fig. S1A). Among hundreds of modifi-
cations screened over 10 years, these three, in
combination, provided stable, crystallizable pro-
tein. Size-exclusion chromatography coupled with
multiangle light scattering (SEC-MALS) and SDS–
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of the
resulting protein (termed GPCysR4) demonstrates
that the GP elutes as a monomer and that the
protein is efficiently processed into GP1 and GP2
subunits but that the two subunits remain asso-
ciated (fig. S1, B and C). Further, enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay analysis with a panel of
human antibodies demonstrates that GPCysR4
is recognized by neutralizing antibodies that re-
quire native association between the GP1 and GP2
subunits (7) and is not recognized by antibodies
against post-fusion GP2 (fig. S1D). Together, these

 results suggest that GPCysR4 is in its native,
prefusion state.
Monomeric GPCysR4 was incubated with
excess Fab 37.7H and subjected to SEC-MALS
analysis. SEC-MALS indicated the formation of
trimeric GP-Fab complexes in addition to mono-
meric GP-Fab complexes (fig. S1B).
Crystals of both the monomeric and trimeric
fractions of the GPCysR4-Fab 37.7H complex
formed in space group P6122 and diffract to
3.2 Å with a trimer of GP bound to three Fabs
in the asymmetric unit (table S1 and fig. S1E).
Phases were determined with an iterative ap-
proach by using molecular replacement with a
related Fab structure and the LCMV GP crystal
structure (34).
Architecture of the trimer
In the crystal structure, the soluble LASV GPCysR4
trimer adopts a compact tripod shape that closely
matches the tomographic reconstruction of the
trimeric GPC spike from authentic Lassa virions
(9) (Fig. 1, A and B). Notably, the arenavirus GP
lacks a central three-helix fusion subunit core evi-
dent in other class I glycoproteins such as Ebola
virus GP (42), HIV-1 Env (36, 39), and influenza
hemagglutinin (HA) (43) (fig. S2). Instead, the
1775-Å2 surface area buried at the trimeric in-
terface arises from interactions between both the
GP1 and GP2 subunits between monomers, par-
ticularly a helices 1, 2, and 3; the C-terminal tail
of GP1; and heptad repeat 1 (HR1) of GP2 (Fig. 1C
and fig. S4). Our recent work demonstrated that
mutation of either S138 or L143 (Lassa number-
ing) to arginine prevented rescue of recombinant
LCMV virions (34). In LASV, these residues lie
at the trimeric interface on a2 and contact the
GP1 C terminus of the neighboring monomer
(Fig. 1C and fig. S4). Hence, contacts observed to
form the trimer interface in the crystal structure
are essential for virus viability.
GPs of the arenavirus family are heavily gly-
cosylated. Lassa GP has 11 potential N-linked
glycosylation sites on each monomer, which to-
gether comprise ~25% of the total mass of the
protein. In the trimeric structure presented here,
we can now visualize the location of the majority
of these glycans (fig. S5). The glycans shield the
side and lower portions of the trimer, leaving only
a few regions vulnerable to antibody binding—
(i) the b-sheet face of GP1 where LAMP-1 and
the New World arenavirus receptor transferrin
receptor 1 (TfR1) bind (28, 30), (ii) three regions
of GP2, the fusion peptide, fusion loop, and HR2,
and (iii) the GP1- and GP2-involving trimeric
interfaces (Fig. 1D and fig. S6A). Modeling of the
larger, oligo-mannose glycans that might be
present on the viral surface (44) reinforces the
significant effect that glycosylation has on the
neutralizing antibody evasion for the arenavirus
family (8, 45) (fig. S6A). Further, analysis of glycan-
protein interactions in this structure reveals the
molecular basis for the specific and strong in-
fluences of glycosylation on viral fitness (46). For
example, Bonhomme and co-workers found that
recombinant LCMV bearing a mutation to re-
move the N79 glycan site (Lassa numbering) was
unable to be rescued (46). We find here that this
glycan packs against the fusion peptide (fig. S6B)
and may shield and provide stability to this highly
hydrophobic region.
Receptor binding in the context of
the trimer
The overall structure of LASV GPCysR4 aligns well
with the previously determined structure of the
LCMV GP monomer with a 2-Å RMSD over the
entire structure and a 1-Å RMSD over the core
elements (b sheets and a helices of GP1 and
all of GP2) (Fig. 2A). Differences between the
two structures outside the core can be mapped to
three main regions: (i) the flexible loops con-
necting the upper, b-sheet face and the lower
a-helical face of GP1, (ii) the ~20 C-terminal res-
idues of GP1, and (iii) the fusion peptide (Fig. 2A).
In LCMV, the C terminus of GP1 lies in close ap-
position to the N terminus of GP2. In the LASV
trimer, the C terminus is translated 30 Å, points
away from GP2 into the apex of the trimer, and
packs against a1 and a2 of the neighboring mono-
mer (Figs. 1C and 2B). Enzymatic cleavage of GP1
from GP2 is required to achieve this separation
of the termini and formation of this trimeric as-
sembly. Last, the fusion peptide adopts a confor-
mation in the LASV trimer different from that in

 the LCMV dimer, where it packs into a dimer
interface (Fig. 2A) (34).
Lassa virus uses extracellular and intracellular
receptors for efficient entry into host cells. On the
cell surface, the virus engages matriglycan on
a-DG and other receptors (21–24). Residues
involved in binding to a-DG (34, 47–49) can
now be mapped in the context of the trimer.
Note that all of these residues are found at the
trimeric interfaces (Fig. 2B), suggesting that
LASV GP may need to be a trimer to interact
with a-DG. Indeed, we previously observed that
a-DG does not bind to the monomeric LCMV
GP1 alone (34).
Once inside the cell, LASV binds to the lyso-
somal receptor LAMP1 (10–12). A histidine triad
(H92, H93, and H230) has been identified as
important for pH sensing and LAMP1 binding
(30, 50) and is located on the b-sheet face of GP1
(Fig. 3A). Comparison of this structure of LASV

 the structure of LASV GP1 solved as an isolated
subunit at pH 5 shows differences in the posi-
tions and interactions made by the three histi-
dines. In the neutral-pH, prefusion complex, H92
packs against N89, another glycan identified by
Bonhomme and coauthors (46) as essential for
LCMV rescue (Fig. 3B and fig. S6B). In the low-
pH structure of GP1 alone, H92 is in essentially
the same location, but its interaction partner, N89,
is shifted ~10 Å away. Similarly, in the neutral-pH,
prefusion complex, H93 is located on the under-
side of a b sheet and makes a hydrogen bond with
the main-chain oxygen of N90. In the low-pH
structure of GP1 alone, H93 is instead oriented
180 degrees away from its location in the GP
trimer and is unable to make the same hydrogen
bond. Presumably, the local environment expe-
rienced by these residues at neutral and low pH
may alter the structural stability of the entire GP1
subunit to release its hold on GP2.
Other significant structural differences be-
tween the neutral-pH complex and the low-pH
GP1 include elongation and rotation of a1 and
a2 from two antiparallel helices in GP1 of the
neutral-pH prefusion complex to a single helix
in the low-pH GP1 monomer, as well as rear-
rangement of residues 200 to 214 from a helix-
loop structure in the prefusion complex to a
two-stranded b sheet in the low-pH monomer
(Fig. 3A). Further, in the low-pH GP1, the visible
termini are T77 and S237, and both are oriented
upward, away from where GP2 would be. In the
prefusion complex, residues 59 to 75 in the N ter-
minus form an extended b strand, which assembles
with strand b11 of the GP2 T loop; residue S237
continues on to form a4 in the GP1 C terminus.
Hence, the helices, loops, and C terminus of GP1
are flexible and adopt alternate positions when
not bound by GP2.
Conformational changes in GP2 are well known
during fusion. Based on these structural data, it
is tempting to speculate that important confor-
mational changes also occur in GP1 during low-
pH–mediated LASV entry.
Old and New World arenaviruses share a sim-
ilar organization of the GP1 core and are ~60%
identical in GP2 by sequence, which allows
modeling of other arenavirus receptor and anti-
body interactions in the context of a GPC trimer.
Arenaviruses in the New World category bind
TfR1 as their cellular receptor, and a structure of
MACV GP1 in complex with a TfR1 monomer is
available (28). MACV GP1 aligns to the prefusion
LASV GP1 with a 2.5-Å RMSD for the core, and
modeling illustrates the relative positions of the
TfR1-binding sites relative to each other in the
arenavirus trimer (fig. S7A). Neutralizing anti-
bodies are known against this TfR1-binding site
for JUNV (32), and modeling of the JUNV-Fab
complex into the LASV trimer assembly suggests
that three such Fab fragments could bind in the
context of the JUNV GPC trimer (fig. S7B).
Structural definition of the anti-LASV
37.7H epitope
The antibody 37.7H against LASV was isolated
from a Sierra Leonean survivor of Lassa fever.
This antibody neutralizes viruses representing all
four known lineages of LASV in vitro (7) and offers
protection from lethal LASV challenge in guinea
pig (51) and potentially nonhuman primates. The
antibody simultaneously binds two GP monomers
at the base of the GP trimer, where it engages four
discontinuous regions of LASV GP, two in “site A”
and two in “site B” (Fig. 4, A and B). Site A contains
residues 62 to 63 of the N-terminal loop of GP1
and residues 387 to 408 in the T-loop and HR2
of GP2. Site B contains residues 269 to 275 of the
fusion peptide and residues 324 to 325 of HR1
of GP2 (Fig. 4B). In total, 37.7H buries 1620 Å2
of GP: ~1000 Å2 of GP at site A and ~620 Å2 of
GP at site B. Although nearly the entire surface
buried on GP belongs to GP2, the presence of both
GP1 and GP2 is critical for 37.7H recognition (7),
likely because GP1 is required to maintain the
proper prefusion conformation of GP2 for 37.7H
binding.

 The antibody 37.7H also recognizes the GPC
of LCMV (7) but does not recognize the GPC of
the more distantly related Old World arenavirus
LUJV nor the GPC of New World arenaviruses
(7). Sequence comparison among these arenavi-
ruses demonstrates nearly complete sequence con-
servation throughout the 37.7H epitope for all
LASV lineages and LCMV (fig. S8). However, the
sequences of LUJO, JUNV, and MACV GPCs are
far more divergent, particularly in HR2 of GP2,
which is heavily involved in binding to 37.7H.
The 37.7H antibody neutralizes by
stabilizing the prefusion GP
The quaternary nature and the involvement of
the fusion peptide in the 37.7H epitope suggest
that this antibody neutralizes the virus by stabi-
lizing GPC in the prefusion conformation, thereby
preventing the conformational changes required
for infection. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed
the ability of LASV GP–pseudotyped recombi-
nant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV-LASV GP)
to mediate fusion with cell membranes. We first
confirmed the ability of 37.7H to neutralize rVSV-
LASV GP. Similar to previously published results,
37.7H effectively prevented cellular infection by
rVSV-LASV GP, as did the antibody 12.1F, which
binds to the upper, b-sheet face of LASV GP1 and
is presumed to block cell attachment (7). In con-
trast, antibodies 13.4E, which binds a linear epitope
in the T-loop, and 9.7A, which is a non-neutralizing
GPC-B antibody, did not prevent viral infection
(Fig. 5, A and B). Next, we determined whether
37.7H could prevent fusion of rVSV-LASV GP with
cell membranes when exposed to low pH. Unlike
the non-neutralizing antibodies 9.7A and 13.4E,
which were not effective in preventing fusion,
37.7H reduced fusion by nearly 80% compared
with rVSV-LASV GP alone (Fig. 5C). In contrast,
the neutralizing antibody against GP1 (anti-GP1)
12.1F showed only a slight reduction in infectivity,
suggesting that the effect of 37.7H was strictly due
to disruption in fusogenicity of the GPC and not
attachment to cells.
Before exposure of the GP2 fusion peptide and
loop and subsequent fusion of the viral and host-
cell membranes, LASV GP1 engages LAMP1. En-
gagement of this receptor is thought to require
conformational changes in GP1 that are triggered
by exposure to the low pH in the endosome. To-
mography of LASV spikes in the presence of low
pH and LAMP1 indeed shows an opening of the
trimer compared with its neutral pH conforma-
tion (9). To determine whether 37.7H could pre-
vent these conformational changes, we analyzed
the ability of GPCysR4 to bind to a soluble LAMP1-
Fc fusion alone and when bound to Fab 37.7H.
In the absence of Fab 37.7H, GPCysR4 effec-
tively bound to LAMP1 when exposed to low pH.
In the presence of Fab 37.7H, however, interac-
tion between GPCysR4 and LAMP1 was markedly
reduced (Fig. 5D). Note that the footprint of 37.7H
and the footprint of LAMP1 are separated by
~50 Å, and the angle adopted by the bound Fab
fragments of 37.7H suggests that it is unlikely to
sterically interfere with LAMP1 (fig. S9). Thus,
there are likely to be conformational changes in
GP1 required for LAMP1 binding that are pre-
vented by this human survivor antibody.
Taken together, these results demonstrate that
the probable mechanism of action for 37.7H and
probably for other antibodies in its potent GPC-B
competition group is stabilization of the prefusion
GPC trimer and prevention of the conformational
changes required for binding of LAMP1 and trig-
gering of the GP2 fusion peptide and fusion loop
in the endosome.
Discussion
This structure provides the first high-resolution
image of the trimeric, prefusion arrangement of
an arenavirus GP. The lack of a three-helix core,
the tripod-like arrangement of HR2, and strong
involvement of the GP1 subunit in trimerization
are unique among members of the class I viral
glycoproteins.
This structure illuminates the quaternary epi-
tope of the most abundant class of LASV human
neutralizing antibodies, maps the binding sites
on the GPC trimer for a-DG and LAMP1, and
indicates that this class of neutralizing antibodies
inhibits conformational changes required for
both LAMP1 and membrane fusion. Further, this
structure provides the initial foundation for
understanding the molecular mechanisms of
neutralization of LASV. The availability of this
structure may facilitate development of epitope-
targeted vaccines or broadly reactive antibody-
based therapeutics. Protective antibody epitopes
like 37.7H may well exist for other disease-causing
arenaviruses; this structure now provides the road-
map to developing prefusion GPC constructs for
these other threats to global health as well.

Fig. 5. Effect of antibodies on rVSV-LASV GP infection and fusion. Antibody-mediated neutraliza-
tion of (A) rVSV-LASV GP or (B) rVSV-VSV-G. The antibody 9.7A is non-neutralizing and in the same
competition group as 37
.7H (GPC-B); 13.4E binds to a linear epitope in the T-loop of GP2; 12.1F binds to
the GP1 subunit of LASV. Error bars indicate the standard deviation of at least six (two biological
replicates, each having three or more technical replicates). (C) Antibody-mediated inhibition of rVSV-
LASV GP fusion at the cell surface. Error bars indicate the standard error of the mean of six (except
37
.7H, where N = 9). (D) Fab 37
.7H reduces binding of a LAMP1-Fc fusion protein to LASV GPCysR4. Error
bars indicate the standard deviation of six and three technical replicates.
