Primate brain size is predicted by diet but not 
sociality

The social brain hypothesis posits that social complexity is the primary driver of primate cognitive complexity, and that social 
pressures ultimately led to the evolution of the large human brain. Although this idea has been supported by studies indicat-
ing positive relationships between relative brain and/or neocortex size and group size, reported effects of different social and 
mating systems are highly conflicting. Here, we use a much larger sample of primates, more recent phylogenies, and updated 
statistical techniques, to show that brain size is predicted by diet, rather than multiple measures of sociality, after controlling 
for body size and phylogeny. Specifically, frugivores exhibit larger brains than folivores. Our results call into question the cur-
rent emphasis on social rather than ecological explanations for the evolution of large brains in primates and evoke a range of 
ecological and developmental hypotheses centred on frugivory, including spatial information storage, extractive foraging and 
overcoming metabolic constraints.
P
rimates, especially anthropoids, have relatively large brains 
compared to other mammals. These observations have led 
researchers to propose various explanations for the evolution of 
increased brain size in the primate lineage. Accordingly, numerous 
comparative analyses have been undertaken with the goal of iden-
tifying social and/or ecological variables that explain interspecific 
variation in overall brain size, or of specific brain regions1.
Early studies suggested that ecological factors, such as diet, 
explain relative brain size variation in non-human primates2–5. This 
is consistent with the idea that processing of meat and other foods 
contributed to subsequent increases in hominin brain size6,7 by ful-
filling corresponding higher energy requirements8–11. Later compar-
ative studies emphasized the role of social factors. In particular, the 
social brain hypothesis posits that social complexity is the primary 
driver of cognitive complexity among primates, and that social pres-
sures associated with maintaining group cohesion ultimately led to 
the evolution of the large human brain12–15. This hypothesis has been 
supported by studies indicating positive relationships between rela-
tive brain and/or neocortex size and mean group size2,14–17.
However, research investigating the relationships between rela-
tive brain size and different social and mating system types, which 
may differ in their relative social complexity, has produced highly 
conflicting results17,18. Some studies have shown that polygynan-
drous primate species have the largest brains3,17, consistent with the 
idea that systems that promote the most interactions and relation-
ships between the greatest numbers of individuals might be the 
most cognitively demanding. Conversely, other studies have shown 
that monogamous species have the largest brains18, and have argued 
that monogamy may require greater deception and manipulation 
abilities18 for obtaining extra-pair copulations, produce a relatively 
high cost of cuckoldry, and/or require conflict resolution and coor-
dination abilities for bond maintenance17.
These conflicting results suggest that methodological issues may 
have led different researchers to different conclusions. Throughout 
the comparative study of primate brain size evolution, species sam-
ple sizes used in analyses have been small and idiosyncratic, while 
the statistical techniques available have improved considerably 
since early analyses. For example, many early studies used residuals 
as data, which can cause bias if the control variable co-varies with 
other variables in the analysis; the use of multiple regression with 
the confounding variable incorporated as a covariate is now recom-
mended instead19. In addition, many studies used a phylogeny20 that 
has become outdated and set all branch lengths to 1—a relatively 
radical branch length transformation that presumes an evolution-
ary pattern in which changes occur at the time of speciation in both 
daughter species.
We assembled a much larger and more representative sample of 
primates (> 
140 spp., more than tripling the sample size of previous 
studies) and tested whether multiple measures of sociality (mean 
group size, social and mating system separately) explain variation 
in brain size after controlling for body size, diet and phylogenetic 
history. Although some studies have used relative neocortex size 
rather than whole brain size, this information is not available for 
a large sample of primate species; in any case, the neocortex scales 
hyper-allometrically with brain size21. In its original form, the social 
brain hypothesis was formulated to explain primate intelligence12,13 
and was later discussed as an attempt to explain brain size14,15,22. 
The subsequent focus on the neocortex was not always based on a 
priori reasoning, but because neocortex analyses sometimes showed 
the strongest correlations with the social variables under examina-
tion14. Regions outside the neocortex are also involved in complex 
cognitive functions (for example, cerebellum23, hippocampus24, 
striatum25) and studies show that overall brain size predicts global 
cognitive ability across non-human primates24,26. Furthermore, 
studies by the main proponents of the social brain hypothesis con-
tinue to present analyses of relative total brain size17,22,24, consistent 
with the interpretation that the social brain hypothesis does indeed 
aim to explain evolutionary increases not only in neocortex ratio, 
but in overall brain size.
Results
For each sociality measure, the full model (including all predictors) 
included brain size as the dependent variable, and body size, either 
diet category or percent frugivory and alternative sociality measures

as predictors. We employed phylogenetic generalized least squares 
(PGLS) regression and incorporated phylogenetic uncertainty by 
using two recent consensus phylogenies27,28 and testing across a 
Bayesian block of alternative trees for one of them27, using maxi-
mum-likelihood model averaging, Bayesian phylogenetic mixed 
models and a fully Bayesian phylogenetic regression analysis. We 
compared different branch length transformations and full versus 
reduced models using the Bayesian information criterion (BIC)29. 
The possible effect of within-species group size variation was tested 
via resampling. Consensus tree analyses were repeated within cer-
tain subgroups (anthropoids, catarrhines) and also using female-
only brain and body size data to account for possible effects of grade 
shifts in the nature of sociality and sexual dimorphism, respectively. 
Finally, we reconstructed ancestral states to visualize the evolution-
ary context of brain size evolution and sociality.
Contrary to the predictions of the social brain hypothesis, our 
results indicate that none of the sociality measures examined here 
explain relative brain size variation in primates, which is predicted 
only by diet, with frugivores having relatively larger brains than foli-
vores. Results from analyses across all primates incorporating the 
10kTrees consensus tree27 are presented here in detail because this 
set provides the largest species sample size. Maximum-likelihood 
estimates of lambda were used for branch length transformations 
because other models, particularly those with branch lengths set to 
1 (as in most previous studies), were worse fitting (Tables 1–4). In 
all cases, Type I ANOVAs for models including all predictors indi-
cate that, while body size and diet each explain a significant amount 
of brain size variation, none of the sociality measures examined 
explain additional variation (Tables 1–3). This pattern of significance 
 
remains when percent frugivory is included in the model instead 
of diet category (Supplementary Tables 1–3), and when the order 
in which diet and sociality variables are entered into the model is 
switched (Supplementary Tables 5–10). Phylogenetic uncertainty 
does not affect these patterns, as both consensus trees (Tables 1–3; 
Supplementary Tables 1–18), most maximum-likelihood models 
tested across the block of 1,000 trees (Supplementary Tables 19–26), 
Bayesian phylogenetic mixed models (Supplementary Tables 30–37) 
and fully Bayesian phylogenetic regression analyses (Supplementary 
Tables 27–29) provide statistically indistinguishable results. Within-
species variation also does not affect these results, as the resampling 
analysis of the full group size models confirmed the lack of effect for 
group size (model with diet category: median estimate = − 
0.003, 
95% confidence interval (CI) = − 
0.021 to 0.017; model with percent 
frugivory: median estimate = 0.021, 95% CI = − 
0.008 to 0.047). 
These results are not confounded by sexual dimorphism as analyses 
run using female-only brain and body size data produced similar 
results (Supplementary Tables 38–59). Although some sociality 
measures seem to explain a significant amount of variation within 
a small set of subgroup analyses, these are probably owing to model 
assumption violations and are not consistent when different phylo-
genies or diet proxies are used (see Supplementary Text).
Furthermore, for each sociality proxy, the model including all pre-
dictors is not a good fit relative to models including either body size 
alone or body size and diet (Tables 1–3; Supplementary Tables 1–3, 
 
11–13 and 15–17), whereas the last two are statistically indistin-
guishable from each other (Tables 1–4; Supplementary Tables 1–4, 
11–14 and 15–18). After correcting for multiple comparisons, fru-
givores and frugivore/folivores exhibit significantly larger brains 
than folivores (Table 4), with model estimates suggesting that 
 
frugivores exhibit 25% (95% CI = 8–44%) more brain tissue than foli-
vores of the same body weight. According to primate brain cellular 
scaling rules as determined by the isotropic fractionator method30, 
this predicted difference amounts to an increase of around 1.08 bil-
lion total neurons for a frugivore of average body weight. Relatively 
more neurons for the same body mass probably indicates increased 
processing power that is not simply related to maintenance and con-
trol of the body31. In some supplementary analyses, omnivores also 
exhibit significantly larger brains than folivores (Supplementary 
Tables 58, 66 and 80). These results are supported by the significant

There is strong evidence that the model incorporating a maximum-likelihood value of 
lambda provides relatively better model fit than models incorporating other branch length 
transformations. Non-lambda models exhibit higher BIC values (by > 
6) and very low weights, 
which represent the relative likelihood of a model given the BIC values of all models in the 
comparison. Body size and diet explain a significant amount of variation in brain size after 
controlling for phylogeny and are highlighted in bold. Group size does not explain additional 
variation, as this variable exhibits a low mean square value and a non-significant P value  
(P > 0.05). Compared with a model including only body size, there is strong evidence that the 
model including body size, diet and group size provides relatively poor fit, while there is only  
weak evidence of such for the model including both body size and diet. The model including  
group size exhibits a higher BIC value (by >

likelihood of this model. Notes: branch length comparisons are estimated using maximum-

and positive effect of percent frugivory (Supplementary Tables 1–4, 
 
15–18, 23–29 and 34–37). Phylogenetic uncertainty does not affect 
these differences between dietary categories (Supplementary Tables 14, 
 
22 and 33). Ancestral reconstructions of relative brain size (encepha-
lization quotient, EQ) and the aforementioned sociality measures 
(Fig. 1; Supplementary Figs 1 and 2) highlight notable departures 
from the predictions of the social brain hypothesis.
Discussion
The results presented here are consistent with a range of ecologi-
cal and developmental hypotheses centred on frugivory, including: 
 
(1) necessity of spatial information storage and retrieval3,4; (2) cognitive 
 
demands of ‘extractive foraging’ of fruits and seeds5; and (3) higher 
energy turnover and enhanced diet quality for energy needed dur-
ing fetal brain growth8–11. Together, it seems that frugivory not only 
provides selective pressures on cognitive processing3–5, but compen-
sates for the costs of a metabolically expensive brain via facilitating 
higher energy turnover and/or lower energy allocation to diges-
tion8–11. There are many examples of closely related species with 
similar body sizes, group sizes and social systems that exhibit cor-
responding brain size and dietary differences (for example, Ateles 
versus Alouatta; Supplementary Table 107). Notably, ancestral 
reconstructions elsewhere suggest these changes were not driven 
by reductions in body size32. Results suggesting that omnivorous 
anthropoid, but not strepsirrhine, species have large brains relative 
to folivores probably reflect different behavioural strategies related 
to faunivory. While omnivorous strepsirrhines usually feed on 
insects, a relatively abundant food source, omnivorous anthropoids 
often additionally hunt vertebrates (such as Cebus capucinus33). 
Although frugivores tend to have relatively smaller guts, recent work 
indicates no negative correlation between relative size of the brain 
and digestive tract after controlling for fat-free mass34. The lack of 
relationship between relative brain size and sociality indicated here 
is consistent with previous studies limited to strepsirrhines35 and on 
non-primate taxa (for example, cetaceans36, carnivores37, birds38), 
and suggests that assumptions underlying the primate social brain 
hypothesis and its associated predictions should be re-evaluated.
First, complex social behaviours (for example, coalitions, recip-
rocation) that were previously assumed to be unique to primates 
have now been found in other taxa that do not exhibit relatively 
large brains compared to other members of their order (such as 
spotted hyenas39). Therefore, the premise that social complexity 
necessarily requires cognitive complexity may not always hold, as 
social living challenges might not require flexible cognitive solu-
tions in real-time, but could be solved using simpler evolved rules-
of-thumb40. Observational and simulation studies have suggested 
that simple associative rules may actually explain many complex 
patterns of behaviour40.
Second, the hypothesis that complex social environments are 
more cognitively demanding than properties of the physical envi-
ronment is partially derived from the idea that the former is more 
unstable than the latter and requires more processing power to navi-
gate41. This has not been demonstrated quantitatively41, and stud-
ies indicating a positive relationship between relative brain size and 
survival in mammalian species introduced into new environments 
suggest that long-term environmental variability could select for 
behavioural versatility42.
Difficulties associated with assigning appropriate proxies of 
social complexity and cognitive complexity should not be underes-
timated. For example, mean group size is, ‘at best, a crude proxy’ of 
social complexity43, because larger groups may not be characterized 
by a corresponding increase in the number of differentiated rela-
tionships/interactions44. Future studies using more sophisticated 
proxies may provide better support for the social brain hypoth-
esis. However, our results call into question the current emphasis 
on social rather than ecological explanations for the evolution of 
large brains in primates. Rapid expansion of the hominoid cer-
ebellum suggests technical intelligence was at least as important as 
social intelligence in human cognitive evolution45. Furthermore, 
numerous studies suggest that the neural substrates of tool use may 
represent evolutionary precursors for the evolution of language in 
humans46,47. Technical innovations also allowed for the increased 
incorporation of meat in the diet, and the advent of cooking meat

and other foods6,7. Together with the present study, this body of 
comparative work suggests that both human and non-human pri-
mate brain evolution was primarily driven by selection on increased 
foraging efficiency, with associated changes then perhaps providing 
the scaffolding for subsequent development of social skills.
Methods
Data collection and compilation. We compiled all species averaged data on brain 
and body weights from published literature sources (Supplementary Data: ‘Brain 
Data’ and ‘Body Data’ tabs). Brain weights represent averages of the following:  
(1) brain weights recorded in several original sources (compiled in ref. 48); and  
(2) endocranial volumes (ECV) recorded in ref. 49, which were converted to  
masses by multiplying by a factor of 1.036 g cm−3 (the specific gravity of brain  
tissue50). The final value used for each species represents an average of the  
values provided across studies, weighted according to the study sample size  
(Supplementary Data: ‘Brain Pivot’ and ‘Brain Final’ tabs). This dataset was  
supplemented with secondary source data51. The female-only dataset represents 
brain and body weights of sexed specimens from ref. 49. The subset of species for  
which both brain weight and ECV were available (n = 79) was tested for bias due 
to different collection methods. Agreement was concluded given that: (1) corrected 
ECV and weight measurements were highly correlated (R2 = 0.99); (2) the mean 
difference (corrected ECV – weight) was 0.62 g with a 95% CI including zero  
(− 
1.81 to 3.05 g); and (3) there was low correlation (R2 = 0.20) between the mean 
value of the two methods and the difference. As body weights were unavailable  
for many specimens in the original studies, they represent averages from  
the CRC Handbook of Mammalian Body Masses52, and the AnAge53 and 
PanTHERIA54 databases. Additional data from secondary sources51,55,56 were  
added to supplement this dataset, and were calculated as the mean values of 
males and females. In the course of compiling this dataset, we excluded juveniles, 
emaciated individuals and ‘low-quality’ data (indicated in the AnAge database53) 
when this information was available.
We assigned dietary categories according to previous designations in the 
published literature3,55,57–61 and used a four category scheme, which includes 
folivore, frugivore/folivore, frugivore and omnivore (Supplementary Data:  
‘Diet Data’ tab). Percent frugivory per species was obtained from ref. 62 
(Supplementary Data: ‘Diet Data’ tab). We assigned social and mating systems 
after consolidating assignments listed in published literature sources3,17,18,35,63–66 
(Supplementary Data: ‘System Data’ tab). Social system categories represent the 
four-way categorization scheme typically used in primate studies67, including 
solitary, pair-living, harem polygyny and polygynandry. Mating system  
categories include spatial polygyny, monogamy, polyandry, harem polygyny  
and polygynandry. These two categorization schemes, social system and mating 
system, were used to conform to previous studies using either one, and because 
primate social organizations and mating systems describe distinct categorization 
schemes that are not always congruent, although are often used interchangeably. 
Group size data were collected from numerous primary and secondary 
sources35,59,67–74. Average group size per species was calculated after removing 
duplicate values (Supplementary Data: ‘Group Size Pivot’ tab). This resulted  
in an average of 4.7 group size data points per species.
No simple universally accepted rule exists regarding the ratio of sample  
size to the number of predictors; however, a commonly used rule states that the

exhibit a decrease in group size since their last common ancestor with the great apes (associated with transitioning to monogamy) and an increase in 
relative brain size (concurrent with decreased body size and maintenance or slight increase in absolute brain size32). Similarly, although cebids and the 
aye-aye have not increased group size, their relative brain size has increased (possibly in relation to their extractive foraging behaviours5).

MCMC diagnostics were run using the ‘coda’ package in R82. We report the 
posterior means of the variables included in each model and their 95% CI83,  
and the probability that each explanatory parameter value is > 
0 (PMCMC) as  
all have been hypothesized to have positive associations with brain size.
Finally, we considered the possible effect of phylogenetic uncertainty by  
using Bayesian mixed models to test across a random sample of 100 different 
trees from the previous set of 1,000 10kTrees phylogenies. This was implemented 
using the R package ‘MCMCglmm’84 and modified R code from ref. 85. This 
procedure uses an MCMC estimation approach and accounts for phylogenetic 
non-independence by including the phylogenetic relationships among species 
as a random variable. We confirmed convergence between model chains using 
the Gelman–Rubin statistic, with all models required to have a potential scale 
reduction factor below 1.1 (ref. 86). The effective sample sizes for all terms  
across all models were > 
1,000. In line with previous work84,85, we used an 
uninformative inverse-Wishart distribution and a parameter expanded  
previously, with a half-Cauchy distribution for the random factor. Each model  
was fitted to each of the 100 trees, and the model outputs were combined  
to create coefficient distributions.
We implemented a resampling procedure as a way to incorporate within-
species variation in group size. This procedure involves randomly choosing one 
group size datum for each species and setting it as the species-specific estimate16,87. 
Using this resampling scheme, we created 1,000 species-specific datasets that 
were subsequently analysed using the full (all predictors) group size PGLS model. 
Some iterations encountered optimization errors, which relate to calculating the 
maximum-likelihood of lambda. These were ignored and resampling continued 
until we produced 1,000 models16. To make inferences across these models, we 
determined the 95% CI of the derived group size term coefficients.
Before ancestral reconstruction analyses, polytomies in the phylogenetic tree 
were resolved using the ‘multi2di’ function in the R package ‘ape’88. Maximum-
likelihood ancestral state reconstructions of continuous traits (relative brain size, 
mean group size) were estimated using the ‘fastAnc’ function in the R package 
‘phytools’89. The EQ31 was used as a measure of relative brain size, and the  
equation was derived from our dataset (n = 144 species) using the allometric 
formula E = kPα, where E is brain mass, P is body mass, k is the proportionality 
constant, α is the allometric exponent and the final equation is E = 0.085 × P0.775. 
The root node was set22 to reflect a species characterized by solitary foraging 
(group size = 1) and a relative brain size (EQ = 0.41) based on estimates of early 
Eocene fossil primate brain and body weights (Smilodectes gracilis90: brain = 9.84 g, 
body = 1,600 g, EQ = 0.38; Tetonius homunculus91: brain = 1.55 g, body = 161 g, 
EQ = 0.45; see Supplementary Data: ‘Fossil Data’ tab).
Reconstructions for discrete variables (social and mating system) were 
conducted using an empirical Bayesian method in which the transition matrix  
is fixed at its most likely value, executed by the ‘make.simmap’ function in  
R package ‘phytools’89. The function first fits a continuous-time reversible Markov 
model for the evolution of the trait in question, and then simulates stochastic 
character histories using that model and the tip states on the given tree89.  
To provide information regarding reconstruction uncertainty, marginal ancestral 
reconstructions were performed at each node by computing the set of empirical 
Bayes posterior probabilities that each node is in each state over 500 simulations. 
The root node prior probabilities were set to assume spatial polygyny and solitary 
foraging as the ancestral states for mating system and social system, respectively. 
Different transition rate models were considered using BIC, including: (1) an 
equal rates model, in which a single parameter governs all evolutionary transition 
rates; (2) a symmetrical rates model, in which forward and reverse evolutionary 
transitions between states are constrained to be equal; and (3) an all-rates-different 
model, where each rate is given a unique parameter. The symmetrical rates model 
was ultimately used for both reconstructions as it exhibited the lowest BIC value.

number of cases should be at least 10 times the number of estimated terms75. 
Across all models included in these analyses, the maximum number of terms to 
be estimated is 10 (mating system models including all predictors: 1 = intercept, 
1 = body size (log) coefficient, 3 = diet category coefficients, 4 = mating system 
coefficients, 1 = branch length transformation parameter), and all sample sizes 
exceed 100 species.
Statistical analyses. All statistical analyses were carried out in R 3.2.2. Humans 
(Homo sapiens) were excluded from all analyses because we are an outlier with 
regard to brain size and, consequently, excluding humans or presenting results with 
humans omitted is common practice in comparative studies of brain size18.
For each of the three sociality measures (mean group size, social system, 
mating system), two sets of models were constructed to incorporate either dietary 
category or percent frugivory as the diet measure. In each set, three different 
models were constructed, each of which had brain size as the dependent variable 
and either body size, body size + diet, or body size + diet + sociality proxy as 
predictors. All continuous variables except percent frugivory were log-transformed 
before analyses. Interaction terms were not included for the sake of interpretability 
and to prevent over-parameterization76. Assumptions of the linear model, with the 
exception of uncorrelated errors (see below), were tested and confirmed. Although 
the expected relationship between body size and diet77 was confirmed in this 
sample, all variance inflation factors throughout the linear models did not exceed 
3.3, a cut-off commonly employed78 as it indicates the point at which R2 = 0.70 
between variables. Although residual variances tend to differ between dietary 
categories and social and mating systems, multiple regression models assume the 
error variance is constant across values predicted from the model, and plots of 
residuals versus predicted values support this assumption.
Species represent non-independent cases because they may share traits due 
to phylogenetic inertia, so we tested for phylogenetic signal in linear model 
residuals by estimating values of Pagel’s lambda (λ). Although it has been common 
practice in comparative biology to test the independent and dependent variables 
for phylogenetic signal to justify analysis using phylogenetic methods, PGLS 
assumes that the regression model residuals, not the traits under investigation, 
follow a multivariate normal distribution with variances and covariances that are 
proportional to the species’ phylogenetic relationships. As significant phylogenetic 
signal was detected, PGLS regression was employed in all cases. We used the 
topologies and branch lengths from the GenBank taxonomy consensus tree 
provided on the 10kTrees website27 (version 3) and also repeated all analyses  
using the molecular phylogeny from ref. 28.
Model comparisons were conducted using BIC, rather than Akaike  
information criterion, as the former uses a more conservative penalty for 
additional terms and is more likely to suggest the most parsimonious model,  
or the one with the fewest number of parameters that need to be estimated. 
Sequential analysis of variance (Type I ANOVA) was used to identify variables  
that explained a significant amount of brain size variation.
In some of the analyses limited to catarrhines, maximum-likelihood 
estimations of lambda produced by the PGLS models resulted in a value of zero. 
It is unlikely that these traits should be modelled using ordinary least squares 
regression (equivalent to lambda = 0) and that this result is due to decreased 
sample size. The log-likelihood plots of lambda illustrate this, as they are very flat 
(see Supplementary Fig. 3 for example). Consequently, these models were run 
using a value of lambda obtained by calculating its 95% CI (represented by red 
lines in Supplementary Fig. 3), extracting 100 equally spaced values of lambda 
within this interval and averaging them with each value weighted according  
to its likelihood.
We also considered the influence of uncertainty in phylogenetic relationships 
by using 1,000 different trees from 10kTrees, which were created using Bayesian 
phylogenetic methods and sampled in proportion to their probability27. We 
examined the full (all predictors) PGLS models for each sociality and diet measure 
combination separately for each tree. Type I ANOVA was conducted on each of the 
resulting models, and the range of P values for each predictor was compared with 
those produced by analyses incorporating the consensus tree. We also examined 
the PGLS model including body size and diet separately for each tree to confirm 
brain size differences between dietary categories. We applied model averaging, as 
this procedure takes into account the varying degree of fit of the models to estimate 
regression coefficients79. For each model, we allowed the phylogenetic scaling 
factor (lambda) to take the value of its maximum-likelihood19.
We also fitted regression models using the ‘Continuous’ program in  
BayesTraits V280. As this function can use only continuous variables, we ran 
models using percent frugivory and group size (log) as proxies of diet quality and 
sociality, respectively. This program allowed us to generate posterior distributions 
of PGLS regression models (regression coefficients and scaling parameters) that 
account for phylogenetic non-independence of species data. The analysis sampled 
the tree block of 1,000 trees in proportion to their posterior probability to account 
for phylogenetic uncertainty, and the scaling parameter lambda was sampled 
during the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) regression analysis. Uniform, 
uninformative priors were used, as these reflect the assumption that all possible 
values of the parameters are equally likely a priori81, and this analysis was run  
for 2 million iterations, sampling every 200 iterations, with a burn-in of 200,000.
