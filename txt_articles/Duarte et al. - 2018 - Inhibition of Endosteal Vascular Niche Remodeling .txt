In Brief
Multi-modal microscopy of acute myeloid
leukemia progression within the bone
marrow reveals focal and progressive
remodeling of endosteal blood vessels
coupled to loss of osteoblasts,
hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), and
HSC niches. Preserving endosteal
vessels increases the number of surviving
HSCs and improves the efficacy of
chemotherapy.

SUMMARY
Bone marrow vascular niches sustain hematopoiet-
ic stem cells (HSCs) and are drastically remodeled
in leukemia to support pathological functions. Acute
myeloid leukemia (AML) cells produce angiogenic
factors, which likely contribute to this remodeling,
but anti-angiogenic therapies do not improve AML
patient outcomes. Using intravital microscopy, we
found that AML progression leads to differential
remodeling of vasculature in central and endosteal
bone marrow regions. Endosteal AML cells produce
pro-inflammatory
and
anti-angiogenic
cytokines
and
gradually
degrade
endosteal
endothelium,
stromal
cells,
and
osteoblastic
cells,
whereas
central marrow remains vascularized and splenic
vascular
niches
expand.
Remodeled
endosteal
regions have reduced capacity to support non-
leukemic HSCs, correlating with loss of normal
hematopoiesis. Preserving endosteal endothelium
with the small molecule deferoxamine or a genetic
approach rescues HSCs loss, promotes chemother-
apeutic efficacy, and enhances survival. These
findings suggest that preventing degradation of
the endosteal vasculature may improve current
paradigms for treating AML.
INTRODUCTION
Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) reside in the bone marrow
(BM), where they receive survival and differentiation signals
from several cell types, including endothelial and multiple
lineages of peri-vascular mesenchymal cells (Morrison and
Scadden, 2014). Similarly, cancer growth and chemo-resistance
have been hypothesized to be dependent on a malignant micro-
environment that is highly vascularized (Duan et al., 2014; Pitt
et al., 2015). This relationship is well illustrated in epithelial
cancers, where increased angiogenesis supports growth and
metastasis (Quail and Joyce, 2013).
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is an aggressive leukemia
often accompanied by life-threatening cytopenias. The cure
rate of AML is only 5%–15% in patients greater than 60 years
old (Do
¨ hner et al., 2015). Thus, there is an unmet clinical need
for more effective therapies, especially because the mainstay
of treatment has not changed significantly in the last 30 years
(Do
¨ hner et al., 2015). To develop more selective and better-
tolerated therapies, it is critical that we understand how AML
cells grow, outcompete healthy hematopoiesis, and eventually
generate an environment supportive of chemo-resistant leuke-
mia stem cells. Alterations in BM innervation and stroma have
been described in late stages of disease (Hanoun et al., 2014).
However, the dynamic process leading to this stage is unknown,
and its dissection promises to uncover new therapeutic targets.
There are reports of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)
secretion by AML cells (Fiedler et al., 1997) and of increased

 BM microvasculature density in patients (Aguayo et al., 2000;
Hussong et al., 2000; Padro
´ et al., 2000) and, more recently,
murine models (Hanoun et al., 2014) at advanced stages of
disease. However, clinical trials investigating anti-angiogenic
therapy in AML patients have been disappointing (Fiedler
et al., 2003; Ossenkoppele et al., 2012; Zahiragic et al., 2007).
Thus, questions remain about the effect of AML growth on BM
vasculature and whether vascular remodeling may be beneficial
for the disease. We hypothesized that AML-induced BM
vascular remodeling may be more complex than simple induc-
tion of angiogenesis and that progressive, nuanced changes
could shape the ecological competition between leukemia and
healthy hematopoiesis. A spatiotemporal understanding of
these changes may point to novel candidate interventions that
could restore BM normal ecology, including HSC function,
and in turn make AML cells more susceptible to chemotherapy.
Here, we present a high-resolution, longitudinal analysis of the
progressive and region-specific vasculature remodeling induced
by AML, with a particular focus on the implications for healthy
hematopoiesis. We uncovered (1) morphological and functional
changes in surviving vessels, namely attempted but failed angio-
genesis and increased transendothelial migration of hematopoi-
etic cells; (2) specific loss of endosteal vessels, accompanied
by loss of osteoblastic cells and, most importantly, HSCs; and
(3) endosteal vasculature induction as a successful approach
to rescue healthy HSCs and improve the efficacy of induction
chemotherapy.
RESULTS
Intravital Microscopy Enables the Study of AML Cells,
Healthy Hematopoietic Cells, and the BM
Microenvironment Simultaneously
To study the effects of AML growth on BM vasculature and
HSCs as disease propagates through the tissue, we used the
well-established MLL-AF9-driven murine model of AML, which
recapitulates phenotypic and pathological features of human
MLL-rearranged AML (Krivtsov et al., 2006; Somervaille and
Cleary, 2006). To generate leukemia cells detectable by intravital
microscopy, we harvested myeloid progenitor cells from donor
mice that expressed high levels of fluorescent proteins (FP),
transduced them with a retroviral vector encoding the oncogene
and GFP, and injected them into sub-lethally irradiated recipi-
ents. With this approach, we generated multiple batches of
GFP+ FP+ primary blasts (Figure 1A) that were all CD11b+ and
contained varying proportions of cells expressing progenitor
markers, such as c-Kit, CD34, and FCgRII/III (data not shown).
Experiments were repeated using blasts from different primary
recipients to ensure identification of consistent features of AML
growth and to discount any possible primary donor-specific
phenotype. To achieve reliable disease progression while mini-
mizing the number of blasts injected, 100,000 primary AML
blasts were transplanted by tail vein injection into non-irradiated
secondary recipients. This strategy was critical as potential
myelo-ablative conditioning regimens that could favor AML pro-
gression and cause hematopoietic and stromal damage were
avoided. In all secondary recipients, progressive blast expansion
was observed from days 8 to 10 post-transplantation with full BM
infiltration typically reached between day 20 and 28, with the
variation depending on the source of the primary blasts
analyzed. This leukemic engraftment was accompanied by
infiltration of the spleen, typically delayed compared to BM infil-
tration (Figure 1A). In each mouse, healthy hematopoiesis was
progressively lost with AML expansion (Figure 1B). AML cells,
vasculature, and hematopoietic cells were visualized by intravital
microscopy (IVM) performed on mouse calvarium BM (Fig-
ure 1C), which has been shown to be representative of long
bones’ marrow in terms of stroma composition and ability to
support functional HSCs and their homing and engraftment
(Lassailly et al., 2013; Lo Celso et al., 2009). This approach is
minimally invasive and allows longitudinal observation of cellular
dynamics (including cell migration, proliferation, and death)
taking place within the tissue over the course of hours or days.
This approach has been essential for us to uncover previously
unappreciated biological processes, such as the ability of
HSCs exposed to acute infection to engage wider than normal
BM niches (Rashidi et al., 2014), the migratory behavior of
T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cells during disease
progression and response to chemotherapy, and T-ALL-induced
osteoblastic cells remodeling (Hawkins et al., 2016). In particular,
tile scan images of the entire BM space contained within the
calvarium provide a comprehensive, three-dimensional, single-
cell resolution overview of the overall organization of the
tissue and are therefore ideal to uncover complex remodeling
processes that are still poorly understood.
BM Blood Vessels Are Damaged in AML
To identify progressive changes of blood vessels in situ during
AML progression, we performed IVM of Flk1-GFP transgenic
mice, in which phenotypic endothelial cells (ECs) express
GFP (Figure 2A) and can be visualized lining BM blood vessels
labeled with Cy5-dextran (Figure 2B). We observed multiple,
significant changes in Flk-1 GFP+ blood vessels in mice
burdened with AML (Figure S1). First, most vessels were nar-
rower than those in control mice (Figure 2C). Second, they
were characteristically further from the endosteal bone surface
(Figures 2D and 2E). Imaging of partially infiltrated mice was
consistent with the findings of (He
´ rault et al., 2017) in revealing
that AML cells clustered in patches of highly infiltrated areas,
whereas the remaining BM space contained only sparse AML
cells (Figure 2F). Blood vessels in highly infiltrated areas ap-
peared unusually barbed and presented dynamic subcellular
protrusions toward the parenchyma (Figure 2F, right panels).
High-resolution time-lapse recording of blood vessels at late
stages of AML revealed sequential formation and retraction of
sprouts (Figure 2G; Movie S1), similar to those described in
response to strong angiogenic stimuli (Gerhardt et al., 2003; Ja-
kobsson et al., 2010). However, this sprouting process was
never efficient, and we could not detect formation of any steady
lateral branches. This is consistent with the increased levels of
VEGF-A detected in mice infiltrated with AML (Figure 2H). We
also occasionally observed vascular damage caused by EC
breakage into small fragments (Movie S2). Consistent with
this observation, we observed abundant 1- to 4-mm-sized
cellular debris of endothelial origin (GFP+) in the vascular lumen
of AML-burdened mice (Figures S2A and S2B; Movie S3).
These debris particles maintained expression of phenotypic
endothelial
markers,

 endomucin (Figure S2C), and contained nucleic acids within an
intact membrane (Figure S2D).
Endosteal Vessels Are Specifically Lost in Mice
with AML
Prompted by our initial observations, we performed in-depth
analysis of blood vessels in the endosteal areas of long bones
using
immunofluorescence
of
whole,
undecalcified
long
bone sections from healthy and diseased mice (Figure 3A).
This approach allowed us to simultaneously investigate AML-
mediated changes in the vasculature of different BM areas: the
central marrow diaphysis; the bone-lining endosteum; and the
trabecular metaphysis. We were able to detect a significant
decrease of vessels in the endosteum and metaphysis over
time (Figures 3B and 3C). The endosteal vessels were signifi-
cantly, and progressively, lost at both intermediate (40%–50%
BM infiltration) and advanced (>80% BM infiltration) disease
stages (Figure 3C). Notably, vessel loss was specific to these
areas and not observed in the diaphysis region, where vessels
were either maintained or transiently increased (Figures 3B and
3C). To investigate the relevance of these observations in
humans, we performed additional histological analysis of BM
trephine biopsies from AML patients with >80% infiltration and
confirmed that endosteal vessels were decreased (Figures 3D
and 3E). Additionally, endosteal vessels were maintained in a
murine model of Notch-driven T-ALL (Figures S3A and S3B),
suggesting that the vascular remodeling we observed is specific
to AML. These findings pointed to a specific depletion of the
functionally unique endosteal endothelium, recently shown to
regulate osteogenesis (Kusumbe et al., 2014) and to maintain
HSCs (Itkin et al., 2016; Kusumbe et al., 2016).
Because we observed differential remodeling of the microen-
vironment in AML-burdened mice, we questioned whether they
could be triggered by regional variations in leukemia cells. To
address this question, we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-
seq) analysis on sorted AML cells from trabecular-rich areas
(crushed metaphysis) or central BM areas (flushed diaphysis;
Figure 3F). We compared the transcriptome of endosteal and

 central AML cells originating from three independent primary
donors to non-transformed granulocyte macrophage progeni-
tors (GMPs) from the BM of healthy mice. Gene expression
and multi-dimensional scale analyses illustrated that each AML
batch had its own unique gene expression signature, consistent
with clonal evolution of tumor cells, whereas control GMPs were
extremely homogeneous (Figures 3G–3I).
Despite the similarity in gene expression between endosteal
and central AML cells, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA)
demonstrated endosteal AML cells were enriched for expression
of genes involved in the inflammatory response (Figure 3J) and
tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling pathways (Figure 3K).
Furthermore, the anti-angiogenic cytokine Cxcl2 (also known
as MIP-2a or chemokine gro-b; downstream of TNF; Tessier
et al., 1997) was significantly more expressed in endosteal
AML cells (Figures 3L and 3M). Analysis of TNF and CXCL2 levels
in BM fluids confirmed that both cytokines were specifically and
highly increased in endosteal areas of AML-burdened mice (Fig-
ures 3N and 3O). These results highlight the importance of
inflammation in AML pathogenesis and support a role for
CXCL2 and TNF in the remodeling of endosteal vessels.
BM Stroma Is Locally and Progressively Depleted in AML
Flow cytometry analysis (Figures S3C–S3H) demonstrated that,
although the proportion of ECs in surviving stroma was
increased in AML-burdened mice (Figure S3E), the absolute
number of ECs was not statistically significantly different (Fig-
ure S3F). However, phenotypically defined endosteal ECs
(CD31hiEndomucinhi
or
CD31+Sca-1+)
were
significantly
reduced in diseased mice (Figures S3G and S3H). To better un-
derstand how AML affects overall BM stroma, we imaged
chimeric mice bearing membrane-bound Tomato+ stroma and
wild-type, non-fluorescent hematopoietic cells injected with
yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)+GFP+ double-positive AML
blasts. At >50% BM infiltration, we observed a dramatic reduc-
tion of overall stromal cells in vivo, including the stroma
surrounding blood vessels and adjacent to bone (Figure S4A).
Consistent with this pattern, extensive IVM time-lapse (7–12 hr)
of these mice revealed that blood vessels underwent abnormal
oscillations, suggesting that their anchorage to the surrounding
parenchyma had been lost (Figure S4B; Movie S4, arrowheads).
Extensive stroma loss was confirmed by flow cytometry analysis
of non-chimeric mice, revealing a >10-fold reduction in the num-
ber of CD45� Ter119� cells in the BM of AML-burdened mice
(Figure S4C). To better understand the process leading to such
dramatic overhaul of BM stroma, we performed live imaging at
earlier stages (days 10–12 post-injection of leukemia blasts;
5%–15% infiltration). At these earlier time points, we could
compare areas with low and high infiltration within the same
mouse (Figure S4D). Here, peri-vascular and endosteal stroma
were depleted in highly infiltrated areas, whereas both compo-
nents maintained a normal appearance in weakly infiltrated
areas, suggesting that AML cells remodel the stroma locally after
reaching a certain threshold density.
Loss of Healthy Hematopoiesis Is Temporally and
Spatially Correlated with Endosteal Remodeling
Because the endosteal endothelium has been shown to locate
next to and sustain osteoblasts (Kusumbe et al., 2014), we
expanded our analysis of the endosteal microenvironment to
include a focused investigation of osteoblastic cells (CFP+ or
GFP+ cells in Col2.3-CFP/GFP reporter mice, respectively)
during AML growth. IVM of the calvarium of Col2.3-GFP mice
revealed that GFP+ osteoblastic cells were significantly reduced
in an infiltration-dependent manner (Figures 4A and 4B). IVM of
chimeras containing CFP+ osteoblastic cells, mTomato+ healthy
hematopoietic cells, and YFP+GFP+ leukemia revealed that AML
cells, as they remodel stroma and vessels locally, also outcom-
pete healthy hematopoietic cells and eliminate osteoblastic cells
(Figures 4C and 4D). This finding indicated that microenviron-
mental and hematopoietic changes induced by leukemia evolve
focally and in parallel. IVM of healthy and highly infiltrated
double-transgenic Flk1-GFP/Col2.3-CFP mice confirmed that
osteoblasts and endosteal vessels were lost in the presence of
AML, whereas central vessels were maintained (Figure 4E). To
understand whether one microenvironment component may be
lost first, we analyzed long bone sections from mice at interme-
diate stages of disease (Figure 4F). Within the same bone,
osteoblasts were significantly decreased only in areas with
high levels of leukemic infiltration (Figure 4G), whereas we could
detect loss of endosteal vessels in areas with intermediate levels
of infiltration (Figure 4H). These data suggest that endosteal
vessels may be lost earlier than osteoblasts.
We next investigated the hematopoietic changes associated
with microenvironment remodeling. Analysis of non-chimeric
mice with increasing AML infiltration by flow cytometry showed
a progressive decrease of overall normal hematopoietic cells in
the BM (Figure 1B) and more specifically of Lineage�, cKit+
Sca-1+ (LKS) progenitor cell and LKS CD48� CD150+ HSC pop-
ulations (Figures 5A and S5A). Importantly, HSCs in the BM were
significantly reduced only at late stages of disease (Figure 5A),
when endosteal and metaphyseal vessels, as well as osteo-
blastic cells, were all drastically reduced (Figures 3 and 4).
Furthermore, whereas LKS cells are lost in areas both distant
from (flushed diaphysis) and close to (crushed metaphysis) the
bone (Figure 5B), HSCs are most dramatically lost in the bone-
rich metaphysis (Figure 5C). This observation highlights the as-
sociation and consequent tandem collapse of endosteal vessels
and HSCs at late stages of AML. We also observed that, as dis-
ease progresses, the number of HSCs in the spleen increases
(Figures 5D, 5E, and S5B). Notably, this hematopoietic elevation
coincides with an increase of splenic ECs (Figure 5F).

Cell Stem Cell 22, 64–77, January 4, 2018
 To reconcile our initial observations on the morphological and
structural changes in BM vessels of AML-infiltrated animals (Fig-
ures 2 and 3) with the progressive loss of normal hematopoietic
cells (Figures 5A–5F), we asked whether they could result in
increased hematopoietic cell trafficking. We performed paired
IVM of BM and spleen in the same AML-burdened and control
mice (Figure S5C) and observed increased numbers of healthy
hematopoietic cells adhering to (Figures 5G and 5H; Movie S5)
and transmigrating across (Figures 5I and 5J; Movie S6) endo-
thelial cells in leukemic mice. This pattern of egress may
contribute to the loss of BM hematopoiesis. We also observed
AML cell clusters that adhered to the endothelial cells on their
intravascular surface and compromised blood flow (Movie S7),
likely contributing to the observed functional alterations of the
endothelium (Ramasamy et al., 2016).
AML-Induced Endosteal Remodeling Regulates HSC
Numbers
To confirm that HSC loss from the BM was due to the microenvi-
ronmental changes we observed rather than a direct effect of leu-
kemia cells on the stem cells, we asked whether the remodeled
BM would still have the capacity to support homing of HSCs.
To this end, we transplanted DiD-labeled HSCs into lethally irra-
diated control and leukemic mice (Figure 6A). Two days after
transplantation, significantly lower numbers of HSCs were found
in the BM of leukemic mice (Figure 6B). This observation suggests
that AML leads to a specific collapse of HSC-supportive BM
niches, as previously hypothesized for B cell acute lymphoblastic
leukemia (Colmone et al., 2008). We then investigated whether
maintenance of BM endosteal endothelium during AML growth
would protect HSCs in endosteal areas. To address this, we
treated leukemic mice with deferoxamine (DFO), a clinically
approved prolyl-4-hydroxylase (PHD) inhibitor normally adminis-
tered as an iron chelator but also recently described to induce
endosteal vessel expansion through enhancement of hypoxia-
inducible factor 1a (Hif-1a) stability and activity (Kusumbe et al.,
2014). DFO or control (PBS) treatment started 8 days post-injec-
tion of AML blasts and continued until day 22 post-transplanta-
tion, at which time point the BM was heavily infiltrated (Figure 6C).
DFO-treated mice had similar numbers of AML cells in the BM
(Figure 6D) and similar disease progression (Figures S6A and
S6B) and survival (Figure S6C). Endosteal blood vessels were
increased in DFO-treated mice (Figures 6E and 6F). Consistent
with our hypothesis that HSC numbers depend on endosteal ves-
sels, we observed that leukemic mice receiving DFO had signifi-
cantly higher numbers of HSCs in the trabecular-rich metaphysis,
but not in flushed diaphyseal BM (Figures 6G and 6H). A direct
positive effect of DFO on HSC numbers was excluded through
in vitro culture (Figures S6D–S6G). To further investigate the clin-
ical utility of DFO, we investigated the homing of HSCs in mice in-
filtrated with AML and treated with DFO or vehicle (Figure 6I). In
line with our hypothesis, DFO-treated mice supported HSC hom-
ing to the BM (Figure 6J). Altogether, these data suggested that
rescue of endosteal vessels can support HSCs despite AML
growth and improve HSC homing.
Rescue of Endosteal Vessels Improves Chemotherapy
Efficiency
The observed remodeling of blood vessels in AML-burdened
mice and especially the loss of endosteal vessels led us to
hypothesize that these changes could not only contribute to out-
competing healthy hematopoiesis but also compromise delivery
of chemotherapy. In a xenograft transplantation model of AML,
chemo-resistant leukemia cells were previously shown to locate
near the endosteum (Ishikawa et al., 2007). This suggests that
localization of leukemia cells in areas of BM stripped of their
vasculature could provide them with a survival advantage. In
our model, trabecular areas were enriched for AML cells both
at early and late stages of infiltration and following induction
chemotherapy (Figure S7A). We hypothesized that, by rescuing
blood vessels in endosteal areas, we could increase chemo-
therapy delivery and therefore efficacy. To test this prediction,
we utilized Fbxw7iDEC mutant mice, in which tamoxifen adminis-
tration leads to increased activation of Notch signaling specif-
ically in ECs, thereby increasing the number of endosteal vessels
and arterioles (Kusumbe et al., 2016; Ramasamy et al., 2014).
Fully infiltrated Fbxw7iDEC mutants had increased numbers of
endosteal vessels (Figures 7A and 7B). At this point, we treated
both Fbxw7iDEC and control mice with an adapted form of clinical
induction chemotherapy (cytarabine [Ara-C] and doxorubicin
[Doxo]; Wunderlich et al., 2013; Figures 7C and S7B–S7D). In
agreement with a previous report (Hooper et al., 2009), we
observed significant chemotherapy-induced damage to the
BM vasculature, including endosteal vessels, in both control
and mutant mice (Figure 7D). We observed that, after treatment,
the Fbxw7iDEC mutants had reduced numbers of surviving AML

 cells in the BM (Figure 7E), delayed relapse (Figure 7F), and
increased survival (Figure 7G). Altogether, these data suggest
that the rescue of endosteal vessels before induction chemo-
therapy can improve its efficacy.
DISCUSSION
Our study describes how AML cells focally and progressively
remodel BM vasculature to transform HSC niches into preferen-
tial leukemia microenvironments. In particular, BM vasculature
editing is anatomically diverse, with endosteal vessels being pro-
gressively obliterated, whereas central marrow vessels survive,
albeit with compromised function. The two main consequences
of this are HSC loss specifically from endosteal areas and
survival of leukemia cells following chemotherapy treatment.
Intravital microscopy provided us with the unique opportunity
to perform detailed, longitudinal analysis of progressive changes
occurring across the entire vascular bed irrigating the calvarium
BM.

ture as a whole (Aguayo et al., 2000; Hanoun et al., 2014;
Hussong et al., 2000; Padro
´ et al., 2000). Consistent with initial
reports of the angiogenic potential of AML cells (Fiedler et al.,
1997), we observed increased levels of VEGF-A in leukemic
mice and endothelial cell dynamics resembling angiogenic
sprouting (Gerhardt et al., 2003). However, these sprouts never
gave rise to the formation of new vessels, which might be driven
by VEGF-A-mediated tip cell competition (Jakobsson et al.,
2010). The expression of additional angiogenic factors by AML
cells might also explain the disappointing results of the clinical
trials testing anti-angiogenic therapies for AML patients (Fiedler
et al., 2003; Ossenkoppele et al., 2012; Zahiragic et al., 2007).
Furthermore,
the
combination
of
high-resolution
intravital
microscopy and quantitative flow cytometry analysis of BM
ECs showed that the apparent relative increase in ECs is a
consequence of the overall loss of BM stroma. This finding
contrasts with observations made in solid tumors, where most

 often accumulation of stroma and pro-fibrotic changes are
reported adjacent to the cancerous cells (Quail and Joyce, 2013).
Whereas central marrow vessels were maintained during AML
infiltration, we observed dramatic remodeling of endosteal ves-
sels. These vessels were initially remodeled in areas containing
foci of disease but eventually almost disappeared from the BM
of heavily infiltrated animals. AML cells in endosteal areas were
enriched
in
inflammatory
and
TNF
gene
signatures
and
expressed higher levels of CXCL2. Both TNF and CXCL2 levels
were locally increased in endosteal areas. This is consistent
with the recently described role of TNF in vascular destruction
(Kammertoens et al., 2017). Furthermore, CXCL2 is an angiogen-
esis inhibitor (Cao et al., 1995) that has also been shown to mobi-
lize HSCs from the BM (Fukuda et al., 2007) and to be associated
with poor prognosis and reduced survival in AML (Katsumura
et al., 2016). Overall, our data support future investigation of
the role of CXCL2 and TNF in the vascular remodeling and loss
of HSCs induced by AML in endosteal regions.
In parallel with endosteal vessel remodeling, we also observed
a similar pattern of osteoblastic cell loss. It was shown previously
in a mouse model of myeloproliferative neoplasia based on
widespread induction of BCR-ABL that aberrant differentiation
of mesenchymal progenitor cells led to an expansion of dysfunc-
tional osteoblasts associated with loss of HSC activity (Schepers
et al., 2013). Here, we observed the depletion of not only osteo-
blasts but also endosteal vessels. This interpretation does not
exclude ‘‘re-wiring’’ of mesenchymal progenitors; however, it
highlights a dramatic imbalance between osteoblast generation
and loss. Most importantly, our findings are consistent with
studies that reported decreased numbers and activity of
osteoblasts in patients with AML (Krevvata et al., 2014). Using
a complementary experimental model, Hanoun and colleagues
have
shown
that
sympathetic
neuropathy
promotes
the
expansion of nestin+ mesenchymal stem cells and limits their
differentiation into NG2+ cells in the arteriolar niche of mice
with AML (Hanoun et al., 2014). These data, when combined
with our results presented here, suggest that fast-growing AML
depletes stroma with niche function.

 disease burden, we obtained detailed temporal information on
the progression of AML-induced BM remodeling. We have
recently reported a similar collapse of the osteolineage at late
stages of T-ALL (Hawkins et al., 2016). In contrast with AML,
here we observed that endosteal vessels are not lost in T-ALL,
highlighting the specificity of microenvironment remodeling in
different types of leukemia. However, analysis of human AML
samples revealed endosteal vessel remodeling in unrelated
AML types. Our findings, together with clinical evidence demon-
strating that cytopenias are more common and severe in AML
than in T-ALL, suggests that endosteal vessel remodeling may
be the cause of dramatic cytopenias associated with AML.
Splenomegaly, though rare in AML patients, is present and
accompanied by extramedullary hematopoiesis in experimental
mouse models of acute leukemia. In our model, increased EC
numbers in the spleen likely form de novo vascular niches able
to support HSCs and extramedullary hematopoiesis, consistent
with the recent discovery of a peri-sinusoidal niche in the spleen
(Inra et al., 2015). Moreover, we were able to detect functional
changes in endothelial cells, allowing for greater adhesion and
transendothelial migration of hematopoietic cells in diseased
mice. This is consistent with a recent study highlighting
increased vascular permeability in AML (Passaro et al., 2017).
These changes likely contribute to the egress of healthy hemato-
poietic cells from the BM (Bixel et al., 2017; Itkin et al., 2016) and
relocation to the spleen.
Consistent with previous studies indicating that HSCs are rela-
tively resistant to AML invasion (Cheng et al., 2015; Miraki-Moud
et al., 2013), we observed that HSC loss occurs at late stages of
disease infiltration, when we show that endosteal remodeling is
more evident. Treatment with DFO significantly increased the
number of endosteal blood vessels together with endosteal
HSCs and improved the homing of HSCs to the BM. DFO has
been reported to limit leukemic cell proliferation and to poten-
tiate the effect of differentiation therapies in AML through iron
chelation (Callens et al., 2010). Here, no significant changes in
the number of AML cells or disease progression were observed
in DFO-treated mice. This suggests that potential off-target
effects of DFO on AML proliferation did not play a major role in
the protection of HSCs.
Apart from leading to HSC loss, elimination of endosteal
vessels may favor AML cells during chemotherapy administra-
tion by providing them with a vessel-poor microenvironment
where drug delivery would likely be challenged and/or ineffi-
cient and therefore would foster chemo-resistance. Consistent
with our hypothesis, chemo-resistant AML has been shown to
initiate relapse from endosteal areas (Ishikawa et al., 2007).
Our genetic approach showed that endosteal vessels can
be rescued in AML-burdened animals and, in doing so, the
efficacy of chemotherapy treatment increases. Our study sug-
gests that induction of endosteal vessels and vascular normal-
ization are promising avenues to both safeguard residual
healthy hematopoiesis and improve chemotherapy treatment
of AML patients.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Mice
All animal work was in accordance with the animal ethics committee (AWERB) at Imperial College London, UK and UK Home Office
regulations (ASPA, 1986). Flk1-GFP mice were a gift from Alexander Medvinsky (University of Edinburgh) (Xu et al., 2010), PU1-YFP
were a gift from Claus Nerlov (University of Oxford) (Kirstetter et al., 2006). C57BL/6 mice were from Harlan UK Ltd; Col2.3-GFP
(Hawkins et al., 2016), Col2.3-CFP (Paic et al., 2009), and mT/mG (Muzumdar et al., 2007) mice were bred and housed at Imperial
College London, according to institutional guidelines. Animals were housed in a barrier facility, under a 14-hour light / 10-hour dark
cycle and temperature-controlled environment with standard diet and water ad libitum. Male and female mice > 6 weeks old were used.
AML experimental model
To generate disease traceable by both flow cytometry and microscopy, GMPs were sorted from C57/B6 wild-type, mT/mG or
PU.1-YFP mice. GMPs were transduced with pMSCV-MLL-AF9-GFP-based retroviruses as described in (Krivtsov et al., 2006)
and then transplanted into sub-lethally irradiated mice. > 8 weeks post transplantation, recipient mice developed leukemia charac-
terized by multi-organ infiltration of leukemic blasts. GFP+ cells were then harvested from BM and spleen and stored. Blasts from
each primary recipient were labeled as a separate batch. Primary blasts from different mice were thawed, suspended in phosphate
balanced salt solution (PBS) and 100,000 viable cells were transplanted through tail vein injection into secondary, non-conditioned
recipient mice. In some instances secondary blasts were used. Progressive blast expansion was observed from day 8-10 and full
BM infiltration was typically reached between day 20 and 28, depending on the primary blasts analyzed. This was accompanied
by infiltration of the spleen, typically delayed compared to BM infiltration.
T-ALL experimental model
T-ALL was generated as described in detail in (Hawkins et al., 2016; Hawkins et al., 2014). Briefly, fetal liver cells were transduced with
NotchICNDRamDP-based retrovirus. 1 3 106 DsRed+ fetal liver cells were transplanted into lethally irradiated recipients. Upon onset
of primary disease (6-25 weeks), DsRed+ blasts were harvested and cryopreserved. 10,000 primary blasts were transplanted into
sub-lethally irradiated recipients, leading to full BM infiltration in 28 days. Secondary blasts were cryopreserved. 50,000 secondary
blasts were thawed, Ficoll purified and injected into non-irradiated tertiary recipients used for experiments. Disease progression was
monitored through sampling of peripheral blood. Mice at different stages of infiltration were sacrificed and bones harvested for
immunofluorescence.
Human samples
Human trephine biopsies were obtained from patients after informed consent had been obtained, under full ethical approval by the
Alfred Hospital, the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre Human Research Ethics Committee, and St. Vincent’s Hospital Melbourne.

 METHOD DETAILS
Drug treatments
The sample size required for animal experiments was based on preliminary data.
For DFO treatment, daily 100mg/kg deferoxamine mesylate (DFO; Sigma) was administered I.P. from day 8 until day 22 post-
transplantation of AML blasts, at which time mice were sacrificed and their BM analyzed. Control mice were injected I.P. with
100ml of PBS.
Induction chemotherapy for AML was administered when BM infiltration was over 50% by injecting 100mg/kg cytarabine (Ara-C)
I.V. for 5 days and 3mg/kg doxorubicin (Doxo) for 3 days. Ara-C was co-delivered with Doxo on days 1 to 3 and alone on days 4 and 5,
mimicking the 7+3 regimen used in AML patients (Wunderlich et al., 2013). Both drugs were purchased from Sellekchem, MA or
obtained from the Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust.
For EC-specific deletion of Fbxw7, tamoxifen (500 ml/mouse I.P.; Sigma) was given daily to Fbxw7lox/lox Cdh5(PAC)-CreERT2T/+
(Fbxw7iDEC) mice and to control Fbxw7lox/lox and WT mice. In experiments where relapse and survival were analyzed, tamoxifen
was given daily between day 10 and 20 post-transplantation, at which point chemotherapy was initiated. Blinding was done for
the tamoxifen studies.
BM chimeras
To generate chimeras, whole BM cells were obtained from femurs and tibia of wild-type or mT/mG donor mice, diluted in PBS and
transplanted intravenously into lethally irradiated (two doses of 5.5 Gy separated by 3 hours) mT/mG, Col2.3-CFP or Flk1-GFP
recipient mice at a dose of 1.5x106 cells/mouse. Mice were kept on baytril-treated water for five weeks following transplantation.
> 95% chimerism was confirmed after 8 weeks and at that point mice were injected with AML cells and used for intravital imaging
experiments.
Flow cytometry
For hematopoietic and leukemic cell analysis, bones were crushed in PBS with 2% fetal bovine serum and the cells, filtered through
a 40 mm strainer and stained. In some instances, the metaphysis of tibias and femurs were separated and crushed, while the diaph-
ysis was flushed. Cells from crushed metaphysis and flushed diaphysis were then stained and analyzed separately. For stroma
analysis, tibias and femurs were crushed, digested with collagenase I (Worthington, UK) at 37�C, for 20min with 110rpm agitation,
and the obtained cells were filtered through a 70 mm strainer and stained. The following fluorochrome-conjugated or biotinilated
primary antibodies specific to mouse were used: CD3e (145-2C11), CD4 (GK1.5), CD8a (53-6.7), Ter119 (TER119), B220
(RA3-6B2), Ly6G (RB-68C5), CD11b (M1/70), cKit (2B8), Sca-1 (D7), CD34 (RAM34), CD16/32 (93), CD150 (TC15-12F12.2),
CD48 (HM48-1), CD31 (MEC13.3) all from Biolegend, and endomucin (V.7C7) from eBiosciences. For secondary staining,
streptavidin Pacific Orange (Invitrogen) and streptavidin PE Cy7 (Biolegend) were used. Live and dead cells were distinguished
using 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Invitrogen). To detect nucleic acids, the cell-permeant SYTO� 17 Red Fluorescent
Nucleic Acid Stain (Molecular Probes) was used. Calibrite Beads (BD Biosciences) were used to determine absolute cell counts,
as previously described (Hawkins et al., 2007). Cells were analyzed with a LSR Fortessa, sort-purified using a FACSAria III
(BD Biosciences) and data were analyzed with FlowJo (Tree Star).
HSC transplantation and homing analysis
Tibias, femurs, ileac bones, vertebrae and sternum were harvested from donor mice, crushed and filtered through a 40 mm strainer.
Whole BM cells were labeled with a cocktail of biotinilated lineage antibodies (CD3, CD4, CD8, Ter119, B220, Ly6G, CD11b) and
streptavidin magnetic Microbeads (Miltenyi Biotech) to perform a lineage depletion using the MACS� Column Technology (Miltenyi
Biotech). The lineage-depleted sample was stained and sorted for phenotypic HSCs, defined as lineage-cKit+Sca-1+CD48-CD150+
cells. HSCs were centrifuged, suspended in PBS and incubated with Vybrant� 1,1’-dioctadecyl-3,3,30-tetramethylindodicarbocya-
nine perchlorate (DiD) (ThermoFisher Scientific) for 10 min, at 37�C. After washing, 5,000 to 12,000 DiD-labeled HSCs were trans-
planted per mouse via tail vein injection. Control and leukemic recipient mice had been previously lethally irradiated (two irradiations
of 5.5Gy, 3 hours apart). 2 days after transplantation, recipient mice were sacrificed and femurs, tibias and the spleen harvested.
DiD+DAPI-cKit+Sca-1+CD48-CD150+ cells were detected by flow cytometry.
LKS culture and DFO in vitro treatment
Lineage depletion was performed as described above. Live lineage-cKit+Sca-1+ (LKS) cells were sorted and plated at a density
of 15.000 cells per well in a 48-well plate. Cells were maintained in StemSpan media (Stem Cell Technologies) with added 50ng/ml
SCF, 10ng/ml IL-6, 10ng/ml TPO and 20ng/ml Flt3 (all from Peprotech). LKS cells were incubated with 0.5mM, 5mM, 50mM and
500mM DFO. After two days, cells were harvested, stained and the number and frequency of DAPI-cKit+Sca-1+CD48-CD150+
HSCs analyzed by flow cytometry.
RNA sequencing and analysis
RNA-seq was performed as described previously (Waibel et al., 2017, In Press, Leukaemia). Mice were transplanted with primary
AML cells from 3 different donors (batch_1_BM_mTmG, batch_3_BM_mTmG and batch_19_spleen_mTmG). Upon full infiltration,

 tibias and femurs were harvested and metaphysis and diaphysis separated using scissors. Endosteal AML cells were isolated by
crushing the metaphysis and sorting DAPI-GFP+mTomato+ cells. Central AML cells were isolated by flushing the diaphysis and sort-
ing DAPI-GFP+mTomato+ cells. The control population, GMPs, was sorted from whole BM of age- and sex-matched wild-type mice.
Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy� Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). The extracted RNA was analyzed on the Agilent 4200
Tapestation prior to library preparation. High quality RNA with RIN values greater than 9 was used for downstream application.
30mRNA-sequencing libraries were prepared from 100ng of total RNA using the QuantSeq 30 mRNA-Seq Library Prep Kit (Lexogen)
according to the manufacturers instructions and sequenced on a NextSeq 500 (Illumina). The single-end 75bp were demultiplexed
using CASAVAv1.8.2 and Cutadapt (v1.9) was used for read trimming. The trimmed reads were subsequently mapped to the mouse
genome (mm10) using HISAT2. FeatureCounts was used for read counting (Liao et al., 2014) after which differential gene expression
analysis was performed using Voom-LIMMA packages (Law et al., 2014). GSEA2-2.2.2 was used for Gene set enrichment analysis
(GSEA) (Liberzon et al., 2015; Subramanian et al., 2005).
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
To obtain BM supernatants, tibias and femurs were harvested from control and AML-burdened mice. With scissors, the metaphysis
and diaphysis of long bones were separated. To obtain flushed BM supernatant, 70ml of PBS were flushed through each diaphysis,
collected and reflushed; then, cells were excluded by centrifugation at 400 g for 5min; the supernatant was collected and any remain-
ing cells excluded by centrifugation at 500 g for 5min. To obtain crushed BM supernatant, the metaphyses were gently crushed
in 150ml of PBS, and the supernatant isolated by centrifugation as described above. Serum was prepared by collecting blood through
cardiac puncture after terminal anesthesia with pentobarbital; blood was then left at 4�C for 3 hours or more to allow clot formation
and centrifuged at 12,000 g for 10min at 4�C; the supernatant (serum) was then transferred to a new eppendorf tube. BM superna-
tants and serum were stored at �20�C until used for ELISA. DuoSet ELISAs (R&D Systems) were performed according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
Intravital microscopy
Intravital microscopy was performed using a Zeiss LSM 780 upright confocal microscope equipped with Argon (458, 488 and
514 nm), a diode-pumped solid-state 561 nm laser and a Helium-Neon 633 nm, a tunable infrared multiphoton laser (Spectraphysics
Mai Tai DeepSee 690-1020 nm), 4 non-descanned detectors (NDD) and an internal spectral detector array. In some cases a Leica
SP5 was used instead. Live imaging of the calvarium BM was done as described in (Hawkins et al., 2016) and (Scott et al., 2014).
The spleens of live mice were imaged under general, terminal anesthesia. Anesthesia was induced and maintained with isoflurane
in medical O2 (4% isoflurane in 4L/min O2 for induction and 1%–2% isoflurane in 1L/min O2 for maintenance), throughout the
procedure. Mice were placed in the right lateral decubitus position and a small section of hair was removed from the left flank.
A 5-8mm abdominal incision on the left flank above the spleen was used to expose the surface of the spleen, which was mechanically
stabilized with a gentle vacuum using a coverslip vacuum chamber similar to that used in (Headley et al., 2016). A drop of water was
placed on top of the chamber coverslip and the spleen was imaged using a long working distance W Plan-Apochromat 3 20 DIC
water immersion lens (1.0 N.A.). Blood vessels were labeled with 80 mL of 8mg/ml 500kD Cy5-Dextran (Nanocs, MA).
Second harmonic signal was excited at 860-880nm and detected with external detectors. CFP signal was excited at 870nm or
458nm and detected using external or internal detectors; GFP signal: excitation at 880nm or 488nm, external or internal detectors;
YFP signal: excitation at 488nm or 514nm, internal detectors. mTomato/DsRed and Cy5 signals were respectively excited at 561nm
and 633nm and detected using internal detectors. To simultaneously detect SHG, CFP, mTomato, YFP and Cy5 signals in chimeras,
lambda acquisition and online fingerprinting were used and the signal collected using an external 32-channel gallium arsenide phos-
phide (GaAsP) detector. The reference spectra were acquired in different BM areas of the same mouse.
Immunofluorescence of undecalcified long bone sections
Tibias, femurs and hips were harvested and fixed overnight in periodate-lysine-paraformaldehyde (PLP) fixative, at 4�C. The bones
were then washed with 0.1M phosphate buffer, immersed in sucrose (10%–30% gradient) for 48h for cryoprotection, frozen in
optimal cutting temperature (OCT) compound (TissueTek) and kept at �80�C. Sections were obtained using a cryostat (Leica)
and the Cryojane tape transfer system (Leica microsystems). Slides were either kept at 4�C and used in the following week or stored
at �80�C. For staining, slides were re-hydrated in PBS, permeabilised in 0.1% Triton X-100, blocked in 5% goat serum and incubated
with primary antibodies overnight, at 4�C. After washing in PBS, slides were incubated with secondary antibodies, counter-stained
with DAPI, washed in 0.1% Triton X-100 and mounted with Prolong Diamond antifade (Invitrogen). The following antibodies were
used: endomucin (V.7C7, Santa Cruz, 1:100), laminin (L9393, Sigma-Aldrich, 1:50), GFP (ab6556, Abcam, 1:500), goat anti-rat IgG
Alexa Fluor 488 (Life Technologies, 1:400), goat anti-rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor 633 (Life Technologies, 1:400). Images were obtained
using a Zeiss LSM 780 upright confocal/two-photon combined microscope (see intravital microscopy section) and analyzed using
Fiji/ImageJ.
Human trephine biopsies
De-waxed human trephine biopsy sections, obtained under ethical approval from Alfred Hospital, Melbourne, were stained with vWF
antibody (Ready-to-Use, DAKO), counterstained and mounted for viewing. Representative areas of each section were captured and
analyzed by two independent researchers.

 Image processing and quantification
ZEN black (Zeiss, Germany) software was used to stich three-dimensional BM and spleen tilescans (tilescans represent individual
tiles stitched together to form a composite). FIJI/ImageJ was used to visualize, register (Preibisch et al., 2010) and process raw
data. FIJI was used to manually crop out autofluorescent signal from out of the tissue. Cell tracking was performed using FIJI and
cells enumerated in the ROI manager. Automated cell segmentation, and volume measurements were performed in Definiens
(Definiens Developer 64, Germany) using local heterogeneity segmentation (Khorshed et al., 2015) to isolate Flk1-GFP+, Col2.3-GFP+
and mTomato+ AML cells. Vessel-bone colocalization was analyzed using Imaris (Bitplane, Switzerland). After creating a surface for
Flk1-GFP+ signal and a surface for bone (SHG) signal from half tilescans, the Imaris XTension ‘‘Surface surface colocalization’’
was used.
Endosteal vessels were quantified in immunofluorescence sections by dividing the length of blood vessels (marked with laminin
and endomucin) in contact with the bone surface (SHG signal) by the total length of the endosteal surface. Metaphyseal and dia-
physial vessels were quantified by thresholding the vascular signal in the metaphysis and diaphysis and quantifying the area occu-
pied by blood vessels. Microvascular density was quantified manually counting blood vessels and dividing the obtained counts by the
total area.
Vessels oscillation was quantified in FIJI. After registration, maximum projections of 3D movies were produced. In each movie, 2
regions of interest (ROI) were selected and combined in a single object. After clearing the outside of ROIs, a Gaussian filter and a
bleach correction were applied and the vessel movement automatically tracked using the plugin TrackMate.
QUANTITATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSES
Raw data was visualized and processed using Microsoft Excel, MATLAB and GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software Inc.). Group
means were compared using the unpaired Student’s t test. For multiple comparisons, one-way ANOVA with post hoc Tukey test
or Bonferroni correction was used.
An exact one-tailed permutation test was implemented in MATLAB for the time-course data in Figure 7F. The statistic used was the
sum across days of the difference between the mean infiltration in the Cre- and Cre+ cohorts.
For all data, differences were considered significant whenever p < 0.05. * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001; **** p < 0.0001. Specific
statistical parameters (e.g., number of animals used) can be found in the figure legends.
