In Brief
Germinal center reactions are tightly
regulated by follicular helper (Tfh) and
regulatory (Tfr) T cells. Feske and
colleagues demonstrate that both Tfh and
Tfr cells critically depend on store-
operated calcium entry (SOCE) to prevent
autoimmunity and promote anti-viral
immune responses.

SUMMARY
T follicular helper (Tfh) cells promote affinity matura-
tion of B cells in germinal centers (GCs), whereas T
follicular regulatory (Tfr) cells limit the GC reaction.
Store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) through Ca2+
release-activated Ca2+ (CRAC) channels mediated
by STIM and ORAI proteins is a fundamental signaling
pathway in T lymphocytes. Conditional deletion of
Stim1 and Stim2 genes in T cells abolished SOCE
and strongly reduced antibody-mediated immune re-
sponses following viral infection caused by impaired
differentiation and function of Tfh cells. Conversely,
aging Stim1Stim2-deficient mice developed humoral
autoimmunity with spontaneous autoantibody pro-
duction due to abolished Tfr cell differentiation in
the presence of residual Tfh cells. Mechanistically,
SOCE controlled Tfr and Tfh cell differentiation
through NFAT-mediated IRF4, BATF, and Bcl-6 tran-
scription-factor expression. SOCE had a dual role in
controlling the GC reaction by regulating both Tfh
and Tfr cell differentiation, thus enabling protective B
cell responses and preventing humoral autoimmunity.
INTRODUCTION
Humoral immune responses that result in the production of high-
affinity antibodies and the generation of memory and plasma cells
areregulatedinthegerminalcenter(GC)reaction.CD4+Tfollicular
helper (Tfh) cells provide cognate help to GC B cells, thus promot-
ing their clonal selection and affinity maturation (Crotty, 2011; Ma
et al., 2012). Conversely, T follicular regulatory (Tfr) cells that are
derived from thymic regulatory T (Treg) cells co-opt the gene-
expression program of Tfh cells but limit the GC reaction (Chung
et al., 2011; Linterman et al., 2011). A fundamental feature of Tfh
and Tfr cells is their localization in the GC facilitated by the upre-
gulation and loss of chemokine receptors CXCR5 and CCR7,
respectively (Crotty, 2011; Ma et al., 2012). In addition, both cell
types express ICOS, PD-1, and BTLA (Chung et al., 2011; Linter-
man et al., 2011). Tfr cells differ from Tfh cells because they lack
molecules that provide B cell help (such as CD40L, interleukin-
21 [IL-21], IL-4) but instead express inhibitory molecules like IL-
10 and CTLA-4 (Sage et al., 2014; Wing et al., 2014). Both cell
types depend on the expression of the lineage-defining transcrip-
tion factor Bcl-6, suggesting a similar but functionally inverse tran-
scriptional program. The precise mechanisms how Bcl-6 directs
Tfh and Tfr cell commitment are not fully understood (Hatzi
etal.,2015).RecentdatasuggeststhatBcl-6actsmainlyasatran-
scriptional repressor interfering with the differentiation of other
Tcelllineages,forinstancebyantagonizingexpressionofthetran-
scription factors T-bet, GATA3 andRORgt (Hatzi et al., 2015; Oes-
treich et al., 2012; Yu et al., 2009). Although ectopic expression of
Bcl-6 in CD4+ T cells promotes some phenotypic features of Tfh
cells, Bcl-6 alone is not sufficient for Tfh or Tfr cell differentiation
(Liu et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2012). Other transcription factors such
asIRF4(Bolligetal.,2012),BATF(Betzetal.,2010;Iseetal.,2011),
c-Maf (Ise et al., 2011), NFAT (Vaeth et al., 2014), and Ascl-2 (Liu
et al., 2014) are also essential for follicular T cell differentiation.
Tfh cell differentiation is initiated by T cell receptor (TCR) and
non-TCR signals such as cytokines (e.g., IL-6, IL-21) and costi-
mulatory receptors like ICOS (Crotty, 2011; Ma et al., 2012).
During migration of Tfh cells into B cell follicles, ICOS binds to
ICOSL on cognate and bystander B cells to reinforce Tfh lineage
commitment and to assure their proper localization within GCs
(Choi et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2015). Intravital imaging reveals
that both TCR (Shulman et al., 2014) and ICOS (Liu et al., 2015)
interactions elicit transient and sustained intracellular Ca2+ sig-
nals in differentiating Tfh cells.
The primary source of Ca2+ signals in T cells is store-operated
Ca2+ entry (SOCE) from the extracellular space through Ca2+
release-activated Ca2+ (CRAC) channels (Feske et al., 2012).
This pathway is activated after TCR stimulation, which results
in production of inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) and release of
Ca2+ from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ stores. The ER pro-
teins stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) and STIM2 sense
the ER Ca2+ concentration and bind to ORAI1 in the plasma
membrane. ORAI1 is the pore-forming subunit of the CRAC
channel and binding by STIM1 and STIM2 mediates sustained
SOCE (Feske et al., 2012). SOCE regulates numerous signaling

 events including the activation of transcription factors of the
NFAT family (Mu
¨ ller and Rao, 2010). The importance of SOCE
for humoral immunity is evident in patients with inherited loss-
of-function mutations in ORAI1 and STIM1 genes that abolish
CRAC channel function (Feske, 2011). These patients develop
a severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID)-like disease with
recurrent and chronic infections despite normal numbers of T
and B cells as well as normal or elevated serum immunoglobulin
concentrations (Feske, 2011). However, the production of path-
ogen-specific antibodies upon vaccination or infection is
severely impaired (Fuchs et al., 2012; McCarl et al., 2009; Picard
et al., 2009). The patients’ immunodeficiency is further compli-
cated by humoral autoimmunity characterized by autoantibodies
against erythrocytes and platelets, which cause hemolytic ane-
mia and thrombocytopenia (Feske, 2011; McCarl et al., 2009;
Picard et al., 2009). In this study, we investigated the cellular
and molecular mechanisms how SOCE deficiency results in
autoantibody production despite impaired antigen-specific anti-
body responses to infection and immunization, and found that
SOCE controls the transcriptional programs that govern the dif-
ferentiation of Tfh and Tfr cells, which regulate the GC reaction.
RESULTS
Ablation of STIM1 and STIM2 in T Cells Causes Humoral
Autoimmunity
To elucidate whether SOCE regulates follicular T cell func-
tion, we investigated mice with conditional deletion of Stim1
and Stim2 genes in all T cells, which results in complete lack
of SOCE (Oh-Hora et al., 2008). 6-month-old non-immu-
nized Stim1fl/flStim2fl/flCd4cre (double knockout, DKO) mice
showed spontaneous accumulation of CD19+CD38–GL.7+ GC
B cells compared to wild-type (WT) littermates (Figures 1A–1C)
and slightly elevated CD4+CXCR5hiPD-1hi Tfh cells (data not
shown).
Immunohistochemical
analyses
of
spleens
from
Stim1fl/flStim2fl/flCd4cre mice confirmed the presence of sponta-
neous PNA+ GCs within B cell follicles (Figures 1D and 1E and
S1A). In addition, we observed a remarkable aggregation of
immunoglobulin M+ (IgM+) and IgG+ B cells surrounding the
GCs in the spleens of Stim1fl/flStim2fl/flCd4cre mice (Figure S1A).
Consistent with spontaneous GC formation, the percentages
of isotype switched IgM–IgD– B cells were elevated (Fig-
ure S1B). In addition, we found increased numbers of ‘‘natural’’
B220loCD5+ B1a cells in the spleens of Stim1fl/flStim2fl/flCd4cre
mice (Figure S1C). CD19+CD5+ B1-like cells were also increased
in the blood of a patient with a loss-of-function mutation in ORAI1
(ORAI1 p.R91W) that abolishes SOCE (Feske et al., 2006) (Fig-
ure S1D). In line with an augmented GC reaction, isotype switch-
ing and B1a cell numbers, we found increased concentrations of
IgG, IgE, IgA, and IgM in the sera of Stim1fl/flStim2fl/flCd4cre mice
(Figure 1F). Importantly, the sera tested positive for anti-nuclear
antibodies (ANA) with a homogenous (diffuse) staining pattern
(Figure 1G) that was absent in the sera of WT mice. Analysis of
specific autoantibodies showed elevated concentrations of
anti-dsDNA IgM, IgG, and IgA (Figure 1I) as well as increased
anti-Ro (SSA) and anti-La (SSB) IgG autoantibodies in the sera
of Stim1fl/flStim2fl/flCd4cre mice confirming earlier results (Cheng
et al., 2012) (Figure 1J). We also found deposition of immune
complexes in renal glomeruli of most Stim1fl/flStim2fl/flCd4cre
mice at >6 months of age compared to none in WT controls (Fig-
ures 1K and S1E). ANA were also detected in the serum of the
patient with ORAI1 p.R91W mutation (Figure 1H) together with
a markedly elevated anti-dsDNA IgG concentration and anti-
bodies against erythrocytes and platelets (data not shown).
These findings demonstrate that ablation of SOCE in T cells
causes spontaneous GC formation and humoral autoimmunity
in mice and human patients.
SOCE Controls Tfr Cell Differentiation
We previously demonstrated that Stim1fl/flStim2fl/flCd4cre mice
have decreased numbers of Foxp3+ central Treg (cTreg) cells
(Oh-Hora et al., 2008). Whereas the frequency of cTreg cells
was reduced by �50%, the percentage of CXCR5hiPD-
1hiFoxp3+ Tfr cells was more strongly reduced by �80%
compared to WT mice (Figure 2A). In absolute numbers, only
Tfr but not cTreg cells were significantly reduced in Stim1-
Stim2-deficient mice (Figure 2A). Immunohistochemical analysis
confirmed that Foxp3+ Tfr cells were virtually absent within
splenic PNA+ GCs of Stim1fl/flStim2fl/flCd4cre mice (Figure 2B).
It is noteworthy that T cell-specific deletion of Stim1 alone did
not affect the overall frequency of cTreg cells but specifically
reduced Tfr cell numbers (Figures S2A and S2B). This reduction
correlated with spontaneous GC formation and increased titers
of anti-dsDNA autoantibodies (Figures S2C and S2D). Similarly,
frequencies of CD45RO+Foxp3+Helios+ effector Treg (eTregs)
cells were strongly reduced in the ORAI1 p.R91W patient
(Figure 2C). These findings suggest that the reduction in Tfr cells,
but not cTregs in general, is responsible for humoral autoimmu-
nity in SOCE-deficient mice.
To investigate whether SOCE regulates Tfr cell formation
cell intrinsically, we used several approaches. First, we generated
mixed bone marrow (BM) chimeras by reconstituting Rag2–/–
mice with a 1:1 mixture of BM from WT (CD45.1+) and Stim1fl/fl
Stim2fl/flCd4cre (CD45.2+) mice and induced GC formation by
infecting the chimeras with the Armstrong strain of LCMV
(LCMVARM) (Figure 2D). Chimeric mice did not develop any overt
autoimmunity due to the presence of WT Treg cells and controlled
the LCMV infection (data not shown). The population of Tfr cells in
the chimeras was exclusively derived from WT BM (Figure 2D),
whereas CD4+ T cells as a whole and cTreg cells originated in
almost equal parts from BM of WT and Stim1fl/flStim2fl/flCd4cre
mice, suggesting an intrinsic requirement for SOCE in Tfr differen-
tiation. Second, we generated Stim1fl/flStim2fl/flFoxp3-YFPcre
mice with a Treg cell-specific deletion of both genes. These
mice had normal (or elevated) frequencies of overall cTreg
cells in the thymus and secondary lymphoid organs (SLOs),
but completely lacked Tfr cells in their SLOs (Figure 2E) confirm-
ing results in BM chimeric mice. The loss of Tfr cells was accom-
panied by a massive increase in Tfh cells, accumulation of GC B
cells, and elevated concentrations of serum anti-dsDNA IgM and
IgG autoantibodies (Figures 2E–2G) compared to littermate con-
trols. We found marked immunoglobulin deposition in glomeruli
and tubuli in the kidneys of 4-week-old Stim1fl/flStim2fl/flFoxp3-
YFPcre mice that was accompanied by complement C3 fixation
(Figures 2H and S2E) and pathologically increased protein con-
centrations in their urine (Figure 2I). Emphasizing the severity of
the Tfr cell defect, Stim1fl/flStim2fl/flFoxp3-YFPcre mice devel-
oped severe systemic autoinflammation and died within 6 weeks

that SOCE intrinsically regulates Tfr cell differentiation and is
required to prevent autoimmunity in mice and human.
GC Reaction Requires Functional SOCE in Tfh Cells
The production of pathogen-specific antibodies in SOCE-
deficient patients after vaccination or infection is severely
impaired (reviewed in (Feske, 2011)). This is unlikely to be due
to impaired B cell function because B cell-specific deletion of
Stim1 and Stim2 genes in mice did not compromise antibody
production despite abolished SOCE in B cells (Matsumoto
et al., 2011). We reasoned that SOCE might instead control Tfh
cell function and help to GC B cells. We infected young WT
and Stim1fl/flStim2fl/flCd4cre mice (in which spontaneous GC
formation was negligible) with LCMVARM to induce a Tfh cell-
dependent GC reaction (Figure 3). 10 days post-infection
(d.p.i.), we observed significantly reduced frequencies and total
cell numbers of Tfh cells in Stim1fl/flStim2fl/flCd4cre mice
compared to WT controls (Figure 3A). Individual deletion of
Stim1 or Stim2 genes in T cells, which partially reduces SOCE,
did not impair Tfh cell numbers, GC reactions, and antibody pro-
duction upon LCMV infection (Figure S3A-F), suggesting that re-
sidual SOCE in T cells is sufficient for Tfh cell differentiation. To
determine whether SOCE controls Tfh differentiation cell intrinsi-
cally, we used several methods. First, we generated mixed BM
chimeras by reconstituting Rag2–/– mice with BM from WT
(CD45.1+) and Stim1fl/flStim2fl/flCd4cre (CD45.2+) donors. Virtu-
ally all Tfh cells were derived from WT BM after infection with
LCMVARM (Figure 3B) suggesting that the lack of Stim1Stim2
prevents Tfh differentiation. Second, we adoptively transferred
WT or Stim1Stim2-deficient SMARTA CD4+ T cells that express
a LCMV-specific transgenic TCR into congenic WT host
mice followed by LCMVARM infection (Figure 3C). This model ex-
cludes any effects of SOCE deficiency on the TCR repertoire of
CD4+ T cells and on chronic infection or autoimmunity. The
numbers of Stim1Stim2-deficient SMARTA Tfh cells were
significantly reduced after infection compared to WT controls.
Together, these experiments demonstrate a CD4+ T cell intrinsic
role of SOCE in Tfh cell differentiation. We next assessed the
quality of the LCMV-specific Tfh response in Stim1fl/flStim2fl/fl
Cd4cre mice. The frequencies and absolute numbers of all Tfh
cells and of virus-specific Tfh cells that stained positive for
LCMV I-Ab GP66-77 tetramers were significantly reduced in
Stim1fl/flStim2fl/flCd4cre mice (Figure 3D), which was accompa-
nied by a blunted GC reaction (Figures 3E and 3F) and signifi-
cantly decreased concentrations of LCMV-specific IgG in their
serum compared to WT controls (Figure 3G).
To investigate whether SOCE is required not only for the differ-
entiation but also the function of Tfh cells, we analyzed the ability
of Stim1Stim2-deficient Tfh cells to promote isotype class
switching. Only WT but not Stim1Stim2-deficient Tfh cells were
able to promote B cell proliferation and isotype class switching
of naive B cells in vitro (Figures S3G–S3J). In addition, we tested
the role of SOCE in Tfh cells in class switching and affinity matu-
ration in vivo by immunizing WT and Stim1fl/flStim2fl/flCd4cre
mice with the T cell-dependent (TD) and T cell-independent (TI)
antigens keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) or Ficoll, respec-
tively, conjugated to 4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenylacetyl (NP). Tfh
cell differentiation, GC formation, and NP-specific IgG produc-
tion were markedly reduced in Stim1fl/flStim2fl/flCd4cre mice
10 days after NP33-KLH immunization (Figures S3K–S3M). The
decrease in high affinity NP4-specific IgG concentrations was
more pronounced than that of NP25-specific IgGs; by contrast,
IgM responses were normal (Figure S3M). Humoral immune re-
sponses to the TI antigen NP50-Ficoll were not impaired in
Stim1fl/flStim2fl/flCd4cre mice (Figure S3N). Together, these find-
ings demonstrate that SOCE in antigen-specific Tfh cells is
essential for GC formation, isotype class switching, and TD anti-
body production.
SOCE is a signaling pathway present in all T cells and required
for their activation (Feske, 2007). Many viral infections not only
induce a Tfh but also a strong Th1 cell response (Hale et al.,
2013) and we therefore analyzed the specific role of SOCE in Tfh
versus Th1 responses to viral infection. CD4+ T cells isolated
from LCMVARM-infected Stim1fl/flStim2fl/flCd4cre mice showed a
decreased number of Bcl-6+ Tfh cells compared to WT controls,
whereas the numbers of T-bet+ Th1 cells and expression of
T-bet in LCMV-specific GP66-77
+ T cells were comparable (Figures
S4A and S4B). To exclude effects of the immune environment in
Stim1Stim2-deficient mice compared to WT mice such as chronic
infection or autoimmune inflammation that could influence Tfh or
Th1 differentiation, we adoptively transferred CD4+ T cells from
WT SMARTA or Stim1fl/flStim2fl/flCd4cre SMARTA mice into con-
genic WT host mice (Figures S4C). Eight days after LCMVARM
infection, we observed decreased numbers of Stim1Stim2-defi-
cient Tfh cells (defined as Bcl-6+ or CXCR5+SLAM–) but not Th1
cells (defined as T-bet+ or CXCR5–SLAM+; Figures S4D–S4F) indi-
cating that SOCE plays a specific role in Tfh cell differentiation.
To determine whether Tfh cell differentiation also depends on
additional SOCE-dependent extrinsic factors (such as cytokines
secreted by other T cells), we adoptively transferred WT CD4+
CD45.1+ SMARTA T cells into congenic CD45.2+ WT and
Stim1fl/flStim2fl/flCd4cre host mice followed by LCMVARM infec-
tion (Figure 4A). The frequency of WT donor-derived SMARTA
Tfh cells within the CD4+ T cell compartment was similar in WT
and Stim1Stim2-deficient hosts (Figure 4B), indicating that WT
CD4+ T cells can differentiate normally into Tfh cells in an envi-
ronment of SOCE-deficient T cells. In fact, we observed a
massive expansion of overall WT donor SMARTA T cells in
Stim1fl/flStim2fl/flCd4cre hosts (�50%) compared to WT hosts
(�13%; Figure 4B) that was associated with a markedly
increased GC formation and excessive production of LCMV-
specific IgG antibodies (Figures 4D–4F). This expansion of WT
donor Tfh cells in LCMV-infected Stim1fl/flStim2fl/flCd4cre host
mice is likely due to the absence of host-derived Tfr cells (Fig-
ure 4C). These data indicate that SOCE in Tfr cells is not only
required to prevent spontaneous autoimmunity under steady-
state conditions (Figures 1 and 2 and S1 and S2) but also to limit
antigen-specific GC responses during infection. Taken together,
our experiments show that SOCE controls the differentiation of
both Tfh and Tfr cells in a cell intrinsic manner, thereby shaping
the quality and quantity of the GC response.
SOCE Controls Tfh Cell Differentiation and Function
To understand the molecular mechanisms how SOCE regulates
Tfh cell differentiation, we used RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to
compare the transcriptome of Tfh and non-Tfh cells isolated
from LCMVARM-infected WT and Stim1fl/flStim2fl/flCd4cre mice

were significantly (padj < 0.01) dysregulated in Tfh cells from
Stim1fl/flStim2fl/flCd4cre compared to WT mice, of which slightly
more genes were down- (402 genes) than upregulated (313
genes; Figure S5C). We found a dysregulation of various immu-
nological and disease-associated pathways, in particular the
helper T cell differentiation pathway (Figures S5D and S5E).
Numerous transcripts encoding essential receptors and ligands
that initiate Tfh cell differentiation were downregulated in
Stim1Stim2-deficient Tfh cells, including Icos, Cxcr5, Pdcd1,
Btla, Cd200, and Ox40 (Crotty, 2011; Ma et al., 2012) (Fig-
ure
5C).

and BTLA (Figure S5G) on Tfh cells from LCMVARM-infected
Stim1fl/flStim2fl/flCd4cre mice by flow cytometry. Impaired
expression was not due to a general T cell activation defect as
other inducible receptors such as CD44 and CXCR4 were not
affected (Figure S5G). Expression of CD40L mRNA and protein
(Figures 5C and 5D) was reduced in Stim1Stim2-deficient Tfh
cells, which is consistent with our previous findings in overall
CD4+ T cells (Shaw et al., 2014). Expression of the ‘‘T cell helper’’
cytokine IL-21 (Crotty, 2011; Ma et al., 2012) was markedly
impaired in Stim1Stim2-deficient Tfh cells compared to WT
controls (Figures 5E–5G) as were mRNA levels of Il4, Ifng,
Tgfb3, Il17, and leukemia inhibitory factor (Lif) (Figures 5E and
S5H) and protein amounts of IL-4, interferon-g (IFN-g), and IL-
17 after restimulation (Figure S5I). We observed a similar dysre-
gulated expression of CD40L, PD-1, IL-21, IL-4, IFN-g, and IL-17
in antigen-experienced CD4+CD45RO+ effector memory T cells
of the ORAI1 p.R91W patient (Figures 5H and 5I and S5J–S5L).
Collectively, these data indicate that SOCE regulates the expres-
sion of multiple receptors, ligands, and cytokines that are impor-
tant for Tfh cell differentiation and T cell help to GC B cells.
SOCE Regulates the Transcriptional Programming of
Tfh and Tfr Cells
RNA-seq revealed that SOCE regulates several transcription
factors that are essential for the differentiation of Tfh cells (Fig-
ure 6A). The expression of the Ca2+-dependent transcription fac-
tor NFAT2 (or NFATc1) was strongly impaired in Stim1Stim2-
deficient Tfh cells (Figures 6A and 6B). We had previously shown
that Tfh cells predominantly express the NFAT2aA isoform,
whose expression is amplified via Ca2+-dependent positive
feedback regulation mediated by the Nfat2 P1 promoter (Hock
et al., 2013; Vaeth et al., 2014). Accordingly, NFAT2aA expres-
sion in Stim1Stim2-deficient Tfh cells was markedly reduced
(Figure 6B), whereas that of NFAT2b (driven by the Nfat2 P2
promoter) and NFAT1 was normal (Figure S6A). Further analysis
of Stim1Stim2-deficient Tfh cells showed that expression of
numerous NFAT-dependent molecules including CD40L, PD-1,
ICOS, CXCR5, IL-21, and IL-4 (Figures 5 and S5H–S5L) (Mu
¨ ller
and Rao, 2010; Oestreich et al., 2008; Vaeth et al., 2014) and
transcription factors including EGR2, BOB1 (encoded by
Pou2af1), and HIF1a (Mueller et al., 2013; Mu
¨ ller and Rao,
2010) that contribute to Tfh differentiation was decreased (Fig-
ure S6B). These findings suggest that SOCE regulates the differ-
entiation of Tfh cells by controlling the expression of NFAT2aA,
which might represent an early checkpoint for Tfh cell fate
determination.
Moreover, we found that mRNA and protein expression of two
pioneering transcription factors, IRF4 and BATF, that are critical
for Tfh cell differentiation (Betz et al., 2010; Bollig et al., 2012; Ise
et al., 2011) were markedly reduced in Stim1Stim2-deficient Tfh
cells (Figures 6A and 6C–6G). Impaired IRF4 and BATF protein
expression was similar in Stim1Stim2-deficient T cells and in
WT T cells treated with the calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporine A
(CsA) that prevents NFAT activation (Figures S6C and S6D), sug-
gesting that SOCE regulates IRF4 and BATF expression through
NFAT-activation. To establish a causative role of NFAT2 in
the expression of IRF4 and other molecules critical for Tfh cell
differentiation and/or function, we ectopically overexpressed a
constitutive-active form of NFAT2 (caNFAT2) in WT and Stim1-
Stim2-deficient T cells in vitro (Figures S6E and S6F). caNFAT2
completely rescued expression of IRF4, PD-1, CD40L, and
CTLA-4 in Stim1Stim2-deficient T cells (Figures 6E and S6E
and S6F). Only a partial or no rescue was observed for other
Tfh-associated molecules, including ICOS, BATF, or Bcl-6
(data not shown).
Both IRF4 and BATF are known regulators of Bcl-6, which is
essential for the differentiation of Tfh cells (Bollig et al., 2012;
Liu et al., 2014). Bcl-6 mRNA and protein amounts were markedly
reduced in Stim1Stim2-deficient Tfh cells compared to WT con-
trols (Figures 6A, 6H, and 6I). Strongly reduced BCL6 mRNA
expression was also observed in activated T cells from the
ORAI1 p.R91W human patient compared to T cells from healthy
donors (Figure 6J). To test whether ectopic expression of
caNFAT2 or Bcl-6 itself can restore defective differentiation of
Stim1Stim2-deficient Tfh cells in vivo, we transduced naive
CD45.1+ SMARTA CD4+ T cells from Stim1fl/flStim2fl/flCd4cre
mice with caNFAT2 or Bcl-6 and transferred transduced cells
into congenic CD45.2+ WT host mice that were infected with
LCMVARM. The analysis of Tfh cell differentiation in donor T cells
8 d.p.i. showed that caNFAT2 and Bcl-6 partially restored Tfh
cell differentiation in Stim1Stim2-deficient donor cells (Figure 6K).
We further investigated whether SOCE in Foxp3+ Treg cells
controls a similar transcriptional program as in Tfh cells and
thereby regulates Tfr cell differentiation. For this purpose, we
used mosaic Stim1fl/flStim2fl/flFoxp3-YFPcre hemizygous female
mice that harbor both WT (YFP–) and Stim1Stim2-deficient
(YFP+) Treg cells (Figure S6G). These mice do not have overt

 signs of autoimmunity, which allowed us to study Tfr cell differ-
entiation in a normal immunological environment. Although
mRNA amounts of Foxp3 and other Treg markers were normal
in Stim1Stim2-deficient YFP+ Treg cells, the transcription of
genes linked to the ‘‘follicular’’ transcriptional program such as
Icos, Pdcd1, Cxcr5, Nfat2, Irf4, Batf, and Bcl6 was significantly
reduced (Figure S6H) resulting in impaired expression of IRF4
and Bcl-6 proteins in Stim1Stim2-deficient Tfr cells (Figures
S6I and S6J). Taken together, our data show that SOCE controls
the differentiation of both Tfh and Tfr cells through an NFAT-
regulated transcriptional network that includes IRF4, BATF,
and Bcl-6.
SOCE in Tfh Cells Is Essential during Chronic Infection
Patients with loss-of-function mutations in STIM1 or ORAI1 that
abolish SOCE suffer from life-threatening chronic viral infections,
which might be due to their impaired ability to produce antigen-
specific antibodies (reviewed in Feske, 2011). Consistent with
defective seroconversion in these patients, we found that the
percentage of isotype-switched IgG+ B cells in the blood of the
ORAI1 p.R91W patient was low compared to a HD control (Fig-
ure 7A). To investigate the role of SOCE in Tfh cells and humoral
immunity during chronic viral infection, we infected WT and
Stim1fl/flStim2fl/flCd4cre mice with LCMV clone 13 (LCMVCL13)
that induces a persistent infection. Persistent viral or bacterial in-
fections were shown to promote a distinct Tfh cell-mediated
rather than ‘‘classical’’ Th1 and CD8+ T cell-mediated immune
responses (Fahey et al., 2011). Accordingly, we observed that
infection of WT mice with LCMVCL13 generated more Tfh cells
than infection with LCMVARM (Figure S7A). When we infected
Stim1fl/flStim2fl/flCd4cre mice with LCMVCL13 we found a signifi-
cantly decreased percentage of Tfh cells compared to WT
mice (Figure S7B) that was associated with abolished GC forma-
tion (Figures 7B and S7C). Furthermore, LCMVCL13-infected
Stim1fl/flStim2fl/flCd4cre mice failed to generate LCMV-specific
IgG antibodies in response to chronic infection (15–103 d.p.i.)
(Figure 7C) and were unable to control viral titers compared
to WT controls (Figure 7D) resulting in their premature death
40–70 d.p.i. (Figure 7E). These data demonstrate that SOCE in
Tfh cells is indispensable for humoral immunity during chronic
infection in mice and, by extension, in human patients.
DISCUSSION
We here show that SOCE is essential for the differentiation and
function of both Tfh and Tfr cells, which have opposing roles
in regulating the GC reaction and humoral immunity (Chung
et al., 2011; Linterman et al., 2011; Vaeth et al., 2014; Wing
et al., 2014). Impaired Tfh cell development and function in
Stim1fl/flStim2fl/flCd4cre mice resulted in ineffective humoral im-
munity as mice failed to initiate a protective GC reaction after
viral infection or immunization and succumbed to fatal viremia
after chronic LCMV infection. Under non-infected conditions,
the phenotype of aging Stim1fl/flStim2fl/flCd4cre mice was domi-
nated by spontaneous GC formation, production of autoanti-
bodies and autoimmunity, which was due to the severely
reduced numbers and function of Tfr cells. The important role
of SOCE in the regulation of humoral immunity by Tfr cells was
emphasized by Treg cell-specific ablation of SOCE in Stim1fl/fl
Stim2fl/flFoxp3-YFPCre mice, which resulted in an almost com-
plete lack of Tfr cells and fulminant autoimmunity with early
death of mice (despite normal numbers of cTreg cells). These
findings show that SOCE controls the differentiation of cTregs
into effector-type Tfr cells and thus prevents humoral autoimmu-
nity in non-infected mice and by extension humans. SOCE in Tfr
cells also limits antigen-specific GC responses upon infection as
adoptive transfer of virus-specific WT CD4+ T cells into Tfr cell-
deficient Stim1fl/flStim2fl/flCd4cre mice resulted in a dramatically
increased expansion of donor-derived Tfh cells, formation of
GCs and production of virus-specific IgG antibodies after
LCMV infection. SOCE in Tfr cells thus prevents both humoral
autoimmunity and limits the magnitude of antigen-specific B
cell immune responses by regulating Tfr cell numbers and
function.
The combination of impaired humoral immunity to infection
and immunization on one hand and spontaneous autoimmunity
on the other in Stim1Stim2-deficient mice was due to the dual
role of SOCE in Tfh and Tfr cell differentiation and function.
The spontaneous GC formation and humoral autoimmunity is
likely due to several non-mutually exclusive mechanisms. First,
Tfh cell differentiation and function, although insufficient to
generate a robust antibody response to LCMV infection, are
not completely impaired which is apparent in residual Tfh cell
numbers, GCs and virus-specific antibodies present in Stim1-
Stim2-deficient mice. Compared to Tfh cells, however, the
reduction of Tfr cells in non-infected Stim1fl/flStim2fl/flCd4cre
mice is even more pronounced. Given the tight control of the
GC reaction by the opposing influences of Tfh and Tfr cells
(Chung et al., 2011; Linterman et al., 2011; Vaeth et al., 2014;
Wing et al., 2014), it is likely that residual Tfh cell function in
the complete absence of Tfr cells allows for the accumulation
of autoreactive B cell clones in GCs and production of autoanti-
bodies in Stim1Stim2-deficient mice. Second, the numbers of
‘‘natural’’ B1a cells in the spleens of Stim1fl/flStim2fl/flCd4cre
mice and B1-like cells in the blood of a patient with a loss-of-
function mutation in ORAI1 were increased. B1a cells differ
from conventional B2 cells in their origin, location, and function
and produce circulating natural IgM antibodies, which are low af-
finity, polyreactive, and allow recognition of autoantigens that
are implicated in the pathogenesis of several autoimmune

 diseases (Duan and Morel, 2006). Autoreactive B1a cells might
therefore contribute to autoimmunity in SOCE-deficient mice
and patients.
The immune phenotype of Stim1fl/flStim2fl/flCd4cre mice re-
sembles that of patients with loss-of-function mutations in
STIM1 or ORAI1. Their immunodeficiency manifests clinically
with life-threatening chronic infections with herpes viruses and
recurrent bacterial infections (reviewed in Lacruz and Feske,
2015). Although serum concentrations of IgG, IgA, and IgE are
normal or elevated, the production of pathogen-specific anti-
bodies upon infection or vaccination is impaired (reviewed in
Lacruz and Feske, 2015). Nevertheless, these patients develop
autoantibodies against erythrocytes and platelets, which cause
severe autoimmune hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia
(Lacruz and Feske, 2015). Because patients lack SOCE in all im-
mune cells, the effects of impaired T cell, B cell, and DC function

 on their humoral immunodeficiency and autoimmunity remained
poorly defined. Conditional deletion of Stim1Stim2 in B cells
abolishes SOCE, but has no effect on antibody production and
affinity maturation after immunization and does not result in
spontaneous autoimmunity (Matsumoto et al., 2011), indicating
that SOCE in B cells is dispensable for humoral immune re-
sponses. By contrast, conditional deletion of Stim1Stim2 in
T cells compromises humoral immunity and causes autoimmu-
nity, thus closely mimicking the phenotype of SOCE-deficient
patients. The seemingly paradoxical combination of immunode-
ficiency and autoimmunity is not unique to SOCE-deficient
patients and mice but is in fact frequently observed in primary
immunodeficiencies (PIDs) (reviewed in Grimbacher et al.,
2016). The underlying molecular defects cover a wide range of
signaling pathways that involve T cells and/or B cells. We
show here that SOCE is critical to maintain the balance between
the antagonistic functions of Tfh and Tfr cells and to ensure
effective antigen-specific GC reactions while preventing the for-
mation of autoantibodies.
At the molecular level, SOCE is essential to initiate the ‘‘follic-
ular’’ transcriptional programs of Tfh and Tfr cells. In both cell
types, SOCE controls expression and activation of the Ca2+-
regulated transcription factor NFAT2 (Mu
¨ ller and Rao, 2010;
Oh-Hora et al., 2008). Despite functional redundancies between
NFAT2, NFAT1 and NFAT4 (Mu
¨ ller and Rao, 2010; Vaeth et al.,
2015; Vaeth et al., 2012), deficiency of individual NFAT factors
causes non-overlapping phenotypes (Mu
¨ ller and Rao, 2010;
Vaeth et al., 2015). NFAT2aA is the most prominent NFAT iso-
form in follicular T cells (Vaeth et al., 2014) and unique because
its expression is induced after TCR stimulation (Hock et al.,
2013; Mu
¨ ller and Rao, 2010). NFAT2aA expression, however,
was absent in Stim1Stim2-deficient Tfh cells. Consequently,
numerous receptors and effector molecules crucial for Tfh and/
or Tfr cell differentiation and function such as PD-1, ICOS,
CD40L, CXCR5, IL-21, and IL-4 (Crotty, 2011; Mu
¨ ller and Rao,
2010; Vaeth et al., 2014) were markedly reduced in SOCE-defi-
cient follicular T cells. Our data suggest that NFAT controls the
early ‘‘follicular’’ transcriptional program in Tfh and Tfr cells by
regulating expression of the pioneering transcription factors
IRF4 and BATF. Although IRF4 is not specific for Tfh cells, it is
required to regulate Tfh cell differentiation and the GC reaction
by controlling ICOS, IL-21, and Bcl-6 expression (Bollig et al.,
2012). Mice with Treg cell-specific deletion of IRF4 develop lym-
phoproliferative disease with spontaneous GC formation and
elevated serum immunoglobulins (Zheng et al., 2009), which is
reminiscent of Stim1Stim2-deficient mice and suggests an
important role of IRF4 in Tfr cells. Like IRF4, BATF is not specific
for follicular T cells but it controls Tfh cell differentiation by regu-
lating Bcl-6 and c-Maf expression (Betz et al., 2010; Ise et al.,
2011). We show that SOCE mediates IRF4 and BATF expression,
and thus indirectly Bcl-6, through NFAT. Furthermore, NFAT
directly binds to regulatory elements in Irf4 and Batf genes based
on our analysis of genome-wide ChIP-sequencing data from WT
and NFAT-deficient T cells (data not shown) (Martinez et al.,
2015) and inhibition of NFAT activation with CsA abolished
IRF4 and BATF expression. Conversely, ectopic expression of
caNFAT2 in SOCE-deficient T cells restored IRF4 expression.
We have demonstrated previously that deletion of NFAT2 in
T cells selectively impairs the development of Tfr but not Tfh cells
(Vaeth et al., 2014). This finding does not contradict our current
data but rather points to a stronger dependence of Tfr cells on
SOCE and NFAT compared to Tfh cells. Although NFAT2 is high-
ly expressed in Tfh cells, NFAT1 and NFAT4 are also present and
might compensate for the loss of NFAT2 (Vaeth et al., 2014). A
similar phenotype as in Nfat2-deficient mice is observed in
Stim1fl/flCd4cre mice. Although Tfr cell differentiation is impaired
in these mice, the numbers of Tfh cells and their ability to mediate
GC formation and production of antigen-specific antibodies was
normal presumably due to residual SOCE in CD4+ T cells. Collec-
tively, these data suggest that Tfr cells are more dependent on
SOCE and NFAT than Tfh cells, which also explains spontaneous
GC reactions and autoantibody formation in Tfr cell-deficient
Stim1fl/flStim2fl/flCd4cre mice.
Taken together, our data support a model in which SOCE reg-
ulates NFAT and the transcriptional programming of Tfr cells,
which prevent humoral autoimmunity under non-infected condi-
tions by restraining GC reactions to self-antigens. SOCE is also
essential, although to a slightly lesser degree, for the differentia-
tion of Tfh cells and production of antigen-specific antibodies in
response to pathogen challenge. From a translational perspec-
tive, our findings are important because CRAC channel inhibitors
are currently explored for the treatment of various T cell-medi-
ated autoimmune and inflammatory diseases (Feske et al.,
2015) and their benefits have to be weighed against their poten-
tial adverse effects on humoral immunity.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Mice
Stim1fl/flStim2fl/fl mice have been described (Oh-Hora et al., 2013; Oh-Hora
et al., 2008). Cd4Cre, and CD45.1 mice were purchased from The Jackson
Laboratory. All animals were on a C57BL/6 genetic background maintained
under SPF conditions in accordance with institutional guidelines for animal
welfare approved by the IACUC at NYU School of Medicine. Mice were
immunized with 100 mg NP33-KLH or 50 mg NP50-AECM-Ficoll (Biosearch
Technologies) emulsified in Imject Alum (Thermo Scientific) or 100 mg polyI:C
(Sigma), respectively. Acute and chronic viral infections with LCMVARM and
LCMVCL13 were previously described (Shaw et al., 2014). For a detailed list
of mouse strains and infection methods, see Supplemental Experimental
Procedures.
BM Chimeras and Adoptive T Cell Transfer
To generate mixed BM chimeras, we reconstituted lethally irradiated Rag1–/–
or Rag2–/– mice with 2.5 3 106 WT (CD45.1) and 2.5 3 106 Stim1fl/flStim2fl/fl
Cd4cre (CD45.2) BM cells. 8 weeks after transfer, chimeric mice were infected
with 2 3 105 PFU of LCMVARM and analyzed 8–10 days later. For adoptive
transfer of SMARTA cells, total CD4+ T cells were isolated from congenic
CD45.1+ or CD45.2+ WT and Stim1fl/flStim2fl/flCd4cre SMARTA mice using
the Mouse CD4+ T Cell Enrichment kit (STEMCELL Technologies). 4 3 106
CD4+ T cells were injected i.v. into congenic WT and Stim1fl/flStim2fl/fl
Cd4cre host mice. 24 hr later, mice were infected with LCMVARM and analyzed
10 d.p.i.
Flow Cytometry
Staining of surface and intracellular antigens with fluorescently labeled
antibodies was performed as described before (Vaeth et al., 2014). LCMV-spe-
cific T cells were detected with PE-conjugated I-Ab GP66-77 or CLIP
control peptide tetramers, respectively (NIH tetramer core facility). Samples
were acquired on a LSRII flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and further
analyzed with FlowJo software (Tree Star). Sorting of various cell populations
was performed using a Sony SY3200 (HAPS1) cell sorter. A detailed pro-
cedure description and a complete list of antibodies can be found in Tables
S1 and S2.

 ELISAs
IgM, IgG, IgA, and IgE serum titers were measured using commercial ELISA
kits (eBioscience) and analyzed with a SpectraMax M5 microplate reader
(Molecular Devices). For detection of autoantibodies, ELISA plates were pre-
coated with 2.5 mg/ml calf-thymus dsDNA (Sigma), recombinant La, Ro52,
Ro60 (all 10 mg/ml), or native Ro60 protein (5 mg/ml) (Arotec Diagnostics).
Analyses of NP-specific or LCMV-reactive antibody concentrations were
described earlier (Shaw et al., 2014; Vaeth et al., 2014). Serial serum dilutions
were measured using AP-conjugated goat-anti-mouse IgM, IgG, IgA, and IgE
detection antibodies (Southern Biotech).
Proteinuria Testing
Urine protein concentrations were analyzed using Albustix medical dipsticks
(Siemens) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

anti-Foxp3, rat anti-B220 (both eBioscience), polyclonal rabbit anti-CD3
(Dako), chicken anti-C3/C3a (Abcam), and/or biotinylated PNA (Vector Labora-
tories). Anti-CD3 and anti-Foxp3 antibodies were amplified using biotinylated
goat anti-rabbit IgG (Thermo Scientific) or biotinylated goat anti-rat IgG (Molec-
ular Probes). Images were captured using a laser-scanning confocal micro-
scope (Leica TCS SP5 II equipment) and analyzed using ImageJ (NIH). A list
of antibodies and detailed procedures with dilutions of antibodies and staining
of HEp-2 cells can be found in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
Retroviral Transduction
T cells were isolated using the Mouse CD4+ T Cell Enrichment kit (STEMCELL
Technologies) and stimulated with 1 mg/ml plate-bound anti-CD3 (clone 2C11)
plus 1 mg/ml anti-CD28 Abs (clone 37.51, both BioXCess). Stimulated T cells
were spin-infected with 100 ml of concentrated retroviral supernatant (pro-
duced in Plat-E cells using standard protocols) containing 8 mg/ml polybrene
(SantaCruz). 48 hr after transduction, T cells were rested in medium containing
50 U/ml IL-2 and 2.5 ng/ml IL-7 and analyzed in vitro or adoptively transferred
to congenic mice. Detailed procedure descriptions can be found in Supple-
mental Experimental Procedures.
RT-PCR and Transcriptional Profiling
RNA was extracted using RNeasy Micro Kit (QIAGEN) followed by cDNA syn-
thesis with the iScript II Kit (BioRad). Quantitative RT-PCR was performed us-
ing Platinum SYBR Green qPCR SuperMix (Invitrogen) and an Opticon 2 ther-
mocycler (BioRad). Data were normalized to HPRT. A list of all mouse and
human primers can be found in Tables S3 and S4. RNA-sequencing and
data processing is described in detail in the Supplemental Experimental
Procedures.
Statistical Analyses
Data were compared using a two-tailed unpaired Student’s t test or two-way
ANOVA (GraphPad Software). Differences with p values of < 0.05 were consid-
ered significant: *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0,005; ***, p < 0.001.
