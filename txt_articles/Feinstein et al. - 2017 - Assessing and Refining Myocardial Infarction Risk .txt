Abstract
Importance—Persons with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) treated with antiretroviral 
therapy (ART) have improved longevity but are at elevated risk for myocardial infarction (MI) due 
to common MI risk factors and HIV-specific factors. Despite these elevated MI rates, optimal 
methods to predict MI risks for HIV-infected persons remain unclear.
Objective—To determine the extent to which existing and de novo estimation tools predict MI in 
a multi-center HIV cohort with rigorous MI adjudication.
Design—We evaluated the performance of standard-of-care and two new data-derived MI risk 
estimation models in the Centers for AIDS Research Network of Integrated Clinical Systems 
(CNICS) multi-center prospective clinical cohort. The new risk estimation models were validated 
in a cohort separate from the derivation cohort.
Setting—Clinical sites across the U.S. where HIV-infected adults receive medical care in 
inpatient and outpatient settings.

 Participants—HIV-infected adults receiving care anytime since 1995 at 5 CNICS sites where 
MIs were adjudicated (N=19829).
Exposures—Common cardiovascular risk factors, HIV viral load, CD4 count, and medication 
use were used to calculate predicted event rates.
Main Outcome and Measures—Observed MI rates over the course of follow-up, scaled to 10 
years using an observed prime approach to account for dropout and loss to follow-up prior to 10 
years.
Results—MI rates were higher among blacks, older participants, and participants who were not 
virally suppressed. The 2013 Pooled Cohort Equations (PCEs), which predict composite rates of 
MI and stroke, adequately discriminated MI risk (Harrell’s C Statistic = 0.75). Two data-derived 
models incorporating HIV-specific covariates exhibited weak calibration in a validation sample 
and did not discriminate risk any better (Harrell’s C Statistic = 0.72 and 0.73) than the PCEs. The 
PCEs were moderately calibrated in CNICS but predicted consistently lower than observed prime 
rates of MI. The PCEs
Conclusions and relevance—The PCEs discriminated MI risk and were moderately 
calibrated in this multi-center HIV cohort. Adding HIV-specific factors did not improve model 
performance. As HIV-infected cohorts capture and assess outcomes of MI and stroke, the 
performance of risk estimation tools should be revisited.
INTRODUCTION
Longevity among persons with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has increased 
dramatically due to effective antiretroviral therapy (ART).1–4 There are over 1.2 million and 
35 million adults living with HIV in the U.S. and worldwide, respectively. These numbers 
are projected to continue to grow and the aging HIV-infected (HIV+) population is 
increasingly at risk for non-communicable disease-related morbidity and mortality.5–7 HIV+ 
persons have nearly twice the risk for myocardial infarction (MI) and greater risks for heart 
failure and sudden death compared with uninfected persons.8–19
The current paradigm for preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), which 
consists of nonfatal MI, coronary heart disease (CHD) death, and stroke, is based on the 
principle that intensity of prevention efforts should match patients’ absolute risks. This 
requires accurate prediction of ASCVD risks. Although some studies have evaluated 
ASCVD risk estimation models in HIV+ patients, these studies have generally been small 
and assessed endpoints suboptimally.20–22 One exception is the large, predominantly white 
cohort used to derive the D:A:D risk score; this score incorporates specific antiretroviral 
agents but does not incorporate race.23
The American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) 2013 
Guideline on the Assessment of Cardiovascular Risk developed the Pooled Cohort Equations 
(PCEs) for 10-year ASCVD risk prediction to assist with decision-making for ASCVD 
prevention.24,25 These equations were derived from more diverse population-based cohorts 
than prior ASCVD risk prediction tools.26 The PCEs have not been evaluated in a large, 
multi-center HIV cohort. Thus, the objectives of this study were to: (1) evaluate the

 performance of the PCEs; (2) create data-derived, HIV-specific MI risk estimation models in 
a diverse, multi-center HIV cohort with rigorous MI adjudication; and (3) externally validate 
these models in a separate sample.
METHODS
Study Population
We used the Centers for AIDS Research (CFAR) Network of Integrated Clinical Systems 
(CNICS) cohort for all analyses.27 CNICS is a multi-center clinical cohort comprised of 
HIV+ adults 18 years of age or older receiving HIV care at one of eight CFAR clinics in the 
U.S.; initial enrollment was 1995 or later depending on the site, enrollment and follow-up 
are continuous (most recent adjudicated MIs: July 2015), and rigorous central adjudication 
for MI within CNICS has been described in detail.27
Statistical Analyses: 2013 ACC/AHA Pooled Cohort Equations Performance in CNICS
For analyses evaluating PCE model performance, we included all CNICS participants from 
the 5 sites participating in MI adjudication at the time of analysis who were free from MI at 
baseline and had complete baseline data for ASCVD risk calculator variables (age, sex, race, 
total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, smoking status, diabetes, systolic blood pressure, and 
antihypertensive treatment), HIV viral load, and CD4 T cell count. We calculated predicted 
ASCVD risk by inserting individual-level baseline data into the PCEs. In order to account 
for variable follow up time, we used a similar approach to prior analyses evaluating the 
PCEs in cohort studies which accounts for differences between the event prediction interval 
and the available length of follow-up.26 Using this approach, we created an “observed 
prime” (observed’) 10-year MI rate by multiplying the observed 10-year MI rate by the 
Kaplan-Meier 10-year failure estimate. Study follow-up started 6 months after initial CNICS 
study visit or the initial date of MI surveillance. The outcome of interest was time to MI; 
study participants were censored at 10 years, if they experienced death, or if they were lost 
to follow up. We performed sensitivity analyses of the PCEs in which we excluded all 
participants under 40 years old at baseline (because the PCEs were originally intended for 
ASCVD risk assessment in 40 to 79 year olds) and all participants with diagnoses of cocaine 
use given the association of cocaine with MI independent of CVD risk factors.28
We evaluated the discrimination of the PCEs using Harrell’s C statistic; <0.70, 0.70 to 0.80, 
and >0.80 were considered inadequate, acceptable, and excellent levels of discrimination.29 
Model calibration was evaluated by the Greenwood-Nam-D’Agostino (GND) approach, 
which analyzes calibration of models on four levels using a hierarchy of increasing strictness 
(corresponding to mean, weak, moderate, or strong calibration).30,31 The first level (mean 
calibration) measures whether the overall average predicted risk equals the observed event 
rate. The second level (weak calibration) evaluates the slope and intercept of the models; the 
closer to 1 the slope and closer to 0 the intercept, the better the calibration. The third level 
evaluates whether observed and predicted event rates are equal for groups of patients within 
the same general predicted risk strata; if so, the model is considered to be moderately 
calibrated. The fourth level (strong calibration) requires predicted and observed event rates 
to correspond for every covariate pattern and is not possible when continuous predictors are

 used.30,31 We used the GND method to evaluate model calibration for the overall cohort and 
separately by race-sex groups.
Derivation, Validation, and Performance of De Novo HIV-Specific MI Risk Estimator
After analyzing the PCEs, we created two new risk scores using data-derived coefficients. 
We included all variables from the ASCVD risk score, statin use, and HIV-specific variables 
(HIV viral load, CD4 count, any ART therapy, and protease inhibitor use) as possible 
covariates. Single imputation was used for baseline variables with <50% missingness. We 
removed one site, University of Alabama-Birmingham (UAB), from model derivation 
analyses in order to use it as a validation sample; we chose UAB as the validation sample 
because of its demographic similarities to the U.S. HIV+ population, as described in the 
Supplement.32 Data from the other four CNICS sites were randomly split into a training 
sample (to fit the models) and a holdout sample (to evaluate the models). The first risk score 
(HIVMI-1) used lasso and ridge regression, whereas the second (HIVMI-2) used an average 
of Cox models to select variables and determine coefficients. Scores were evaluated in the 
validation cohort by Harrell’s C Statistic and the aforementioned calibration hierarchy.31
We considered simpler methods than creating new data-derived risk scores. One 
supplementary analyses added 10 years to each participant’s baseline PCE risk estimates in 
order to theoretically account for earlier MI occurrence in HIV, whereas the other multiplied 
observed prime MI rates by a uniform data-derived multiplier.
Although a strength of CNICS is its differentiation between type I MIs, which are due to 
plaque rupture and thrombosis, and type II MIs, which result from supply-demand 
mismatch, we did not differentiate between MI types for this analysis because existing 
cardiovascular risk prediction models (including the PCEs) do not differentiate between MI 
types33 and because we had insufficient type I events to derive stable model estimates.
RESULTS
Demographic and Clinical Characteristics
Characteristics of participants with complete baseline covariate measurements (N=11288; 
247 persons with MI over a mean follow-up of 4.1 years) are shown in Table 1. The cohort 
was relatively young at baseline and the majority (70%) were taking ART. Mean 10-year 
ASCVD risk estimates based on the PCEs were highest for black men and lowest for white 
women. Observed MI rates across demographic and clinical strata are shown in 
Supplementary Table 1. MI rates were higher among black men and women, participants 
≥40 years old at baseline, and participants with greater HIV viral loads and lower CD4 
counts. Racial differences in MI rates were largely driven by more type II MIs occurring 
among blacks; type I MI rates were identical for black and white men (3.1/1000 person-
years). Participants with worse HIV viral control and immunologic suppression had elevated 
total and type I MI rates.

 Performance of ACC/AHA Pooled Cohort Equations in CNICS
The PCEs discriminated ASCVD risk adequately overall (Harrell’s C Statistic = 0.75, 95% 
CI 0.71–0.78) and in most race-sex groups (Table 2). The PCEs were relatively well fit in the 
overall cohort [Table 2 and Figure 1; slope = 0.815; intercept = 0.0015; GND test statistic = 
13.1 (p=0.16)] and particularly well fit for white men [Table 2 and Figure 2A; slope = 0.857; 
intercept = 0.009; GND test statistic = 6.4 (p=0.50)], meeting criteria for moderate 
calibration per the GND framework. However, the PCEs were not as well fit for black men, 
black women, or white women (Table 2 and Figures 2B–2D). Observed’ MI rates 
consistently exceeded predicted rates across the low-to-moderate risk spectrum (<10% 
predicted 10-year ASCVD risk); this under-prediction was particularly marked among black 
men (Figure 2B) and black women (Figure 2D). In a sensitivity analysis excluding the 987 
participants with diagnoses of cocaine use, the performance of the PCEs was unchanged. In 
separate supplementary analyses in which we added 10 years to all study participants’ 
baseline PCE inputs and multiplied observed prime MI rates by a uniform multiplier, 
discrimination was similar and calibration was worse than for the PCEs.
Derivation and Performance of New HIV-Specific Risk Scores
In order to create and derive new HIV-specific risk scores, we expanded the cohort from the 
above analyses to include all study participants (Total N=19829; 15849 in the derivation 
sample which was split randomly into training and holdout samples, and 3980 in the 
validation sample). Of the 15849 study participants not in the validation sample, 353 
experienced MIs during a mean follow-up of 4.8 years.
The HIVMI-1 score included several HIV-specific variables in addition to traditional 
ASCVD risk factors and discriminated adequately (Harrell’s C statistic = 0.72; 95% 
confidence interval 0.67–0.78) in the validation sample (Figure 3A). The HIVMI-2 score 
also incorporated several HIV-specific variables in addition to traditional ASCVD risk 
factors (Figure 3B) and discriminated adequately in the validation sample (Harrell’s C 
statistic = 0.73; 95% confidence interval 0.68–0.79). Both HIVMI-1 [slope = 0.397; 
intercept = 0.014; GND test statistic = 102.5 (p<0.001)] and HIVMI-2 [slope = 0.498; 
intercept = 0.010; GND test statistic = 84.2 (p<0.001)] exhibited substantially worse 
calibration than the PCEs. In a sensitivity analysis in the validation cohort including only 
participants with complete covariates, there was little change in the performance of 
HIVMI-1 and HIVMI-2.
DISCUSSION
The ACC/AHA Pooled Cohort Equations (PCEs) exhibited acceptable discrimination and 
moderate calibration when used to predict MIs for HIV+ individuals from a multi-site U.S. 
HIV cohort with adjudicated MIs. Neither of two data-derived models incorporating HIV-
specific variables improved MI risk prediction in this population.
The HIVMI-1 and HIVMI-2 scores did not improve over the PCEs in CNICS for several 
potential reasons. Traditional ASCVD risk factors are essential for risk estimation in general 
and remain important in the setting of HIV; thus, the bar for new risk prediction tools

 incorporating new factors to predict ASCVD events is relatively high. Furthermore, although 
we know HIV-related factors (e.g., HIV viral load and CD4 T cell count) are associated with 
ASCVD, we know relatively little about how strongly these factors or other HIV-associated 
biomarkers are associated with ASCVD. Future risk estimation models incorporating novel 
HIV-specific factors and potentially biomarkers that reflect HIV-related ASCVD risks would 
be of interest. This may provide a future use for biorepository samples from HIV cohorts.
Although the PCEs were moderately calibrated when used for MI prediction in CNICS, 
there remained fairly consistent mismatch between the PCEs and observed’ MIs in CNICS, 
particularly for groups with risks at or near thresholds at which statins are often 
recommended in the general population (5–10% 10-year predicted ASCVD risk). 
Participants for whom the PCEs predicted <10% 10-year ASCVD risk had consistently 
higher-than-predicted MI rates, whereas participants with ≥10% predicted risk generally had 
MI rates that were lower than predicted.
There are several potential reasons for the consistent over-prediction of MI risk in the 
highest risk groups. Patients with poorly controlled HIV may have high predicted MI risk 
and substantial competing risks for non-cardiovascular causes of death. Thus, these 
participants may have contributed many person-years at high predicted risk but died from 
non-cardiovascular causes before theoretical MIs would have occurred, leading to over-
prediction at higher levels of risk. Survival bias may also have contributed to this mismatch. 
Age is a strong contributor to MI risk, and older HIV-infected persons may have an elevated 
burden of traditional and HIV-related MI risk factors. While these factors would contribute 
to elevated predicted MI risk for older HIV-infected persons, these persons would also be 
likely to have survived longer with HIV and may therefore be particularly likely to have 
greater access to care, social support, or other unmeasured factors that could prevent incident 
MI. Finally, patients at higher MI risk were more likely to take statins, which decrease 
incident MI rates and thus may have modified observed’ MI rates downward 
disproportionately in these higher risk groups.
The PCEs were substantially better calibrated than the two new, HIV-specific models 
(HIVMI-1 and HIVMI-2) in CNICS. Thus, these new models as presently constructed 
should not replace the PCEs for ASCVD risk prediction in HIV. An additional difficulty 
with HIVMI-1 and HIVMI-2, as well as other HIV-specific risk prediction models (such as 
the D:A:D risk score)23, is the changing nature of ART; the proportion of HIV+ patients 
taking PIs has changed over time, which may lead to confounding in risk models 
incorporating different ART medications.
The consistent under-prediction of the PCEs over the low-to-moderate risk spectrum may 
have direct clinical implications. Current ACC/AHA guidelines recommend consideration of 
statin therapy for patients at ≥7.5% (and in some cases ≥5%) predicted 10-year ASCVD risk. 
Thus, model calibration is more clinically meaningful in the low- to moderate-risk spectrum 
– near decision thresholds for statin use – than in the highest risk groups, in which the 
benefits of statin therapy most clearly outweigh the risks. Given our finding that HIV+ 
patients at <10% predicted 10-year risk (by the PCEs) had consistently greater-than-
expected event rates, it may be reasonable for clinicians treating HIV+ patients to use the

 PCEs as a baseline gauge of what their patients’ lowest predicted ASCVD risks are. For 
instance, if an HIV+ patient’s predicted 10-year ASCVD risk is 8%, our findings suggest 
that the “true” risk for this patient is at least 8% and perhaps greater. Thus in this case, this 
risk of at least 8% could guide clinician-patient consideration of CVD-preventive therapy, 
keeping in mind potential interactions of these therapies (particularly statins) with ART 
medications.34
A caveat to the clinical applicability of these risk estimates is the relatively high number of 
type II MIs among HIV+ persons in CNICS. Type II MIs occur in the setting of systemic 
disease rather than inciting atherothrombotic events and may not be as effectively prevented 
by atheroprotective therapies such as statins. It is likely that type II MIs are more common 
for HIV+ persons than uninfected persons because of their systemic disease (HIV) and 
susceptibility to states that trigger type II MIs, including but not limited to infection and 
sepsis. Furthermore, the CNICS MI screening protocol incorporated cardiac biomarkers, 
which likely identified a high number of type II MIs that may not have been identified 
otherwise. Interestingly, observed’ MI rates exceeded rates predicted by the PCEs most 
markedly for black men and black women and the proportion of MIs that were type II was 
far greater for black men and black women than their white counterparts; it is certainly 
possible that this excess in type II MIs among blacks drove much of this apparent under-
prediction of MI risk. However, distinguishing between types of MIs was beyond the scope 
of this study because previous risk estimation tools have not differentiated between MI types 
and because we did not have sufficient type I MIs alone to create stable models. Future 
analyses should compare risk prediction models incorporating all MIs versus only type I 
MIs.
This study’s findings should be interpreted in the context of its limitations. We were unable 
to assess stroke because adjudicated stroke data were not yet available in CNICS (or many 
other large HIV cohorts). We accepted this limitation for several reasons. Statins result in 
greater absolute risk reductions for MI than stroke in men, who comprise the substantial 
majority of the HIV+ population in the United States; thus, while stroke risk is incorporated 
into global ASCVD risk estimates in the PCEs, the primary purpose of statin therapy for 
men is generally to prevent MIs.35 It is worth noting that strokes comprise a substantially 
greater proportion of overall ASCVD for women – particularly black women. Thus, the MI 
rates we observed for women in CNICS may be substantially lower than their overall 
ASCVD rates. Additionally, CNICS incorporated biomarkers into its MI screening protocol 
and thus likely captured more MIs than less sensitive adjudication protocols in cohorts from 
which the PCEs were derived. On balance, it is possible that this relative over-assessment of 
MIs and definite under-assessment of strokes resulted in ASCVD rates that would have been 
similar had the methods from previous cohort studies (on which the PCEs were based) been 
used to adjudicate MI and stroke in CNICS.
Another limitation of this study was the relatively short mean follow-up, although many 
participants did have ≥10 years of follow-up. We sought to address the relatively low number 
of persons with follow-up to 10 years by using the observed’ approach. Other study 
limitations include only 5 of 8 CNICS sites analyzed (sites with adjudicated MI data 
available). These limitations were unavoidable and acceptable given the strengths of CNICS

 as a modern HIV clinical cohort with rigorous MI adjudication. Another complicating factor 
is the young age of the U.S. HIV+ population compared with cohorts used to develop the 
PCEs. ASCVD risks increase with age and separation between people with higher and lower 
lifetime ASCVD risks become more apparent; thus, discriminating between risk strata may 
be particularly difficult in younger populations. Finally, a minority (<10%) of patients 
included in our analyses were taking statins. Statin use was more common for those with 
greater ASCVD risk and may have therefore decreased observed’ MI rates for higher risk 
deciles more than for lower risk deciles.
Despite these limitations, this study suggests that the 2013 ACC/AHA Risk Estimator’s 
Pooled Cohort Equations (PCEs) perform better than data-derived models incorporating 
HIV-specific variables at predicting MI risks for HIV+ persons. As longer term follow-up 
data with more ASCVD events become available for HIV+ persons, studies should re-assess 
whether data-derived, HIV-specific risk estimation models can substantially improve 
ASCVD risk prediction over the PCEs in this unique population.

Calibration Plot of Observed’ MIs across Levels of Predicted 10-Year ASCVD Risk, by 
Race-Sex Groups
Each dot on these calibration plots represents a subgroup of the study population at similar 
predicted ASCVD risk. The plots display results for each of the following race-sex groups: 
White Men (2A), Black Men (2B), White Women (2C), and Black Women (2D). Predicted 
10-year ASCVD risks (predicted by the Pooled Cohort Equations) are on the horizontal axis

mismatch with observed’ MI risks exceeding predicted ASCVD risks, whereas dots below 
the line represent mismatch with predicted ASCVD risks exceeding observed’ MIs.

Characteristics and Performance of the De Novo Risk Scores in CNICS
These calibration plots depict the performance of the two de novo risk scores in the 
validation sample (the UAB site of CNICS; N=3980). Variables in bold were not in the 
PCEs but were included in the new models. Predicted 10-year ASCVD risks are on the 
horizontal axis and observed’ MI risks are on the vertical axis. Dots above the line of unity 
represent mismatch with observed’ MI risks exceeding predicted ASCVD risks, whereas 
dots below the line represent mismatch with predicted ASCVD risks exceeding observed’ 
MIs.

*GND Test for Calibration Across Deciles requires at least 2 events in each group, thus the following risk deciles were collapsed together for the whole cohort: the 3 lowest risk deciles for white men; the 2 
lowest risk deciles for black men; the 1–3, 4–6, and 7–9 lowest risk decile for white women (plus a 4th group, the highest risk decile); and the 4 lowest risk deciles for black women. For the analyses of 
participants 40 years or older at baseline, the following risk deciles were collapsed together: none for white men, the 2 lowest risk deciles for black men, the 5 lowest and 5 highest risk deciles for white 
women (thus two groups total), and the 1–3 and 4–5 lowest risk deciles for black women.
