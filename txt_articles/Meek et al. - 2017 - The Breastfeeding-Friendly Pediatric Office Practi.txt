abstract
The landscape of breastfeeding has changed over the past several decades 
as more women initiate breastfeeding in the postpartum period and 
more hospitals are designated as Baby-Friendly Hospitals by following the 
evidence-based Ten Steps to Successful Breastfeeding. The number of births 
in such facilities has increased more than sixfold over the past decade. With 
more women breastfeeding and stays in the maternity facilities lasting only 
a few days, the vast majority of continued breastfeeding support occurs in 
the community. Pediatric care providers evaluate breastfeeding infants and 
their mothers in the office setting frequently during the first year of life. 
The office setting should be conducive to providing ongoing breastfeeding 
support. Likewise, the office practice should avoid creating barriers for 
breastfeeding mothers and families or unduly promoting infant formula. 
This clinical report aims to review practices shown to support breastfeeding 
that can be implemented in the outpatient setting, with the ultimate goal of 
increasing the duration of exclusive breastfeeding and the continuation of 
any breastfeeding.
CLINICAL REPORT
Guidance for the Clinician in Rendering Pediatric Care
BACkgROUND/CURRENt RECOmmENDAtIONS
Breastfeeding has long been documented as the ideal method for feeding 
and promoting the optimal development of infants and children, with 
rare exceptions (see Recommendation 3 below). The American Academy 
of Pediatrics (AAP) describes breastfeeding as the normative method 
of infant feeding. There are countless medical, emotional, and economic 
benefits of breastfeeding as described in the 2012 AAP statement 
“Breastfeeding and the Use of Human Milk.”‍1 Benefits of breastfeeding 
include decreased risk of lower respiratory infections, gastroenteritis, 
otitis media, and necrotizing enterocolitis, the latter being especially 
important in preterm infants. Because breastfeeding is the norm for 
infant feeding, comparatively there are risks associated with the lack 
of breastfeeding, which include an increase in sudden infant death 
syndrome, obesity, asthma, certain childhood cancers, diabetes, and 
postneonatal death.1

The AAP recommends exclusive 
breastfeeding for approximately 
6 months, followed by continued 
breastfeeding for 1 year or longer, 
as mutually desired by mother and 
child.1 The Surgeon General’s Call to  
Action To Support Breastfeeding 
8 in 
2011 emphasized the importance 
of breastfeeding as a public health 
imperative. Breastfeeding is  
strongly promoted, supported,  
and encouraged by the AAP, 
the Academy of Breastfeeding 
Medicine, 
9 the American College of 
Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 
10, 
11  
and the American Academy of 
Family Physicians.12 Each of these 
organizations calls on its members 
to be actively engaged in promoting 
and supporting breastfeeding among 
their patients.
EpIDEmIOLOgy
The rate of initiation of any 
breastfeeding in the US population 
is 81.1% according to data from 
the National Immunization Survey 
(2016, birth cohort from 2013).13 
Although the rate of breastfeeding 
initiation approaches the Healthy 
People 2020 target14 of 81.9%, only 
22.3% of US infants are breastfed 
exclusively at age 6 months. There 
are significant disparities in terms of 
breastfeeding rates in the country; 
among black infants, only 66.3% are 
breastfed at all, and only 14.6% are 
exclusively breastfed through the 
first 6 months of life. Among Native 
American and Alaska Native infants, 
breastfeeding initiation is 68.3% 
and exclusive breastfeeding rates 
at 6 months are 17.9%. Mothers are 
more likely to breastfeed if they are 
married, have a college education, 
live in metropolitan areas, do not 
experience poverty, and do not 
receive benefits from the Special 
Supplemental Nutrition Program for 
Women, Infants, and Children (WIC). 
WIC provides targeted breastfeeding 
support and peer-counseling services 
for mothers who qualify for their 
services. Infants most likely to 
experience toxic stress are least 
likely to be breastfed. According 
to the 2005–2007 Infant Feeding 
Practices Study II, 85% of US mothers 
intended to breastfeed exclusively 
for ≥3 months; however, only 32.4% 
achieved their intended exclusive 
breastfeeding duration.15
CURRENt INItIAtIvES tO INCREASE 
BREAStFEEDINg RAtES
There have been numerous 
initiatives to increase breastfeeding 
exclusivity and duration both in 
hospitals and in the outpatient 
setting. US hospitals accredited by 
The Joint Commission with maternity 
units that have at least 1100 births 
per year are required to report data 
on the Perinatal Care Core Measure 
Set, which includes a measure on 
Exclusive Breast Milk Feeding.16 
There have been major initiatives 
to increase the number of maternity 
facilities designated as Baby-
Friendly. The first of these was Best 
Fed Beginnings, 
17 a collaboration of 
the National Initiative for Children’s 
Healthcare Quality, the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention 
(CDC), and Baby-Friendly USA, 
in a national effort to improve 
maternity care practices and achieve 
designation as Baby-Friendly. 
Through Best Fed Beginnings, 
hospitals implemented the evidence-
based and AAP-endorsed Ten Steps 
to Successful Breastfeeding (Table 1), 
as established in the Baby-Friendly 
Hospital Initiative, developed by the 
World Health Organization (WHO)/
United Nations Children’s Fund.18– 
20 
Additional maternity care facilities 
are pursuing the Baby-Friendly 
designation by participating in 
EMPower Breastfeeding: Enhancing 
Maternity Practices, 
21 in cooperation 
with the CDC’s Division of Nutrition, 
Physical Activity, and Obesity, and 
in partnership with the Carolina 
Global Breastfeeding Institute and 
Population Health Improvement 
Partners. EMPower similarly 
provides support to hospitals in 
quality-improvement methodology 
and breastfeeding support to 
improve maternity care practices 
and achieve Baby-Friendly USA 
designation. The number of births in 
designated facilities increased from 
2.9% in 2007 to 20.01% in January 
2017, 
22 surpassing the Healthy 
People 2020 goal of 8.1%.14
For the national breastfeeding 
targets to be met, outpatient 
support from pediatricians and 
other pediatric care providers is 
imperative. As more infants are

The Ten Steps to Successful Breastfeeding
1. Have a written breastfeeding-friendly policy that is routinely communicated to all health care staff.
2. Train all health care staff in the skills necessary to implement this policy.
3. Inform all pregnant women about the benefits and management of breastfeeding.
4. Help mothers initiate breastfeeding within 1 hour of birth.
5. Show mothers how to breastfeed and how to maintain lactation, even if they are separated from their 
infants.
6. Give infants no food or drink other than breast milk, unless medically indicated.
7. Practice rooming in: allow mothers and infants to remain together 24 hours a day.
8. Encourage breastfeeding on demand.
9. Give no pacifiers or artificial nipples to breastfeeding infants.a
10. Foster the establishment of breastfeeding support groups and refer mothers to them on discharge 
from the hospital or birth center.
a The AAP does not support a categorical ban on pacifiers because of their role in SIDS risk reduction and their analgesic 
benefit during painful procedures when breastfeeding cannot provide the analgesia. Pacifier use in the hospital in the 
neonatal period should be limited to specific medical indications, such as pain reduction, calming in a drug-exposed infant, 
etc. For breastfed infants, pacifier introduction should be delayed until breastfeeding is firmly established. Infants who are 
not being directly breastfed can begin pacifier use as soon as desired.

being discharged from hospitals 
designated as Baby-Friendly 
and having successfully initiated 
breastfeeding, it is essential that the 
pediatricians with whom they will 
follow up are knowledgeable about 
breastfeeding and that their office 
practices are prepared to support 
these breastfeeding dyads. The 
Surgeon General’s Call to Action To 
Support Breastfeeding lists specific 
action steps that apply directly to the 
pediatric outpatient practice (Table 
2).
Many pediatricians have little 
experience in clinical breastfeeding 
management. Analysis of an AAP 
Periodic Survey of Fellows regarding 
breastfeeding in 2004, compared 
with a similar survey in 1995, 
showed that pediatricians were less 
likely to believe that the benefits 
of breastfeeding outweighed the 
difficulties or inconvenience, and 
fewer believed that almost all 
mothers were able to succeed.23 
Unfortunately, more pediatricians 
in 2004 reported reasons to 
recommend against breastfeeding 
compared with the cohort who 
responded in 1995. A 2014 AAP 
Periodic Survey confirmed that 
some of these attitudes persist 
(unpublished data from American 
Academy of Pediatrics Periodic 
Survey of Fellows No. 89).
Szucs et al24 found that there were 
gaps in providers’ breastfeeding 
knowledge, counseling skills, and 
professional education and training. 
The authors showed that providers’ 
cultures and attitudes affected 
breastfeeding promotion and support 
and that the providers used their own 
breastfeeding experiences to replace 
evidence-based knowledge and AAP 
policy statement recommendations. 
Both the Academy of Breastfeeding 
Medicine (ABM)25 and the US 
Breastfeeding Committee26 have 
published recommendations 
regarding the education and 
training of health care professionals, 
including pediatric care providers, 
in breastfeeding support and 
management.
The ABM’s clinical protocol “The 
Breastfeeding-Friendly Physician’s 
Office: Optimizing Care for Infant 
and Children”‍27 details specific 
steps that a practice can take 
to become more breastfeeding 
friendly. These guidelines can 
inform the guidance for pediatric 
offices. Corriveau et al28 sought to 
determine whether implementing 
a program based on this clinical 
protocol affected breastfeeding rates 
within the pediatric primary care 
setting. Even with a diverse patient 
population, rates of both initiation 
of and exclusive breastfeeding 
increased after the implementation 
of the ABM breastfeeding-friendly 
protocol. Feldman-Winter29 
outlined methods to increase 
breastfeeding initiation and duration 
in “Evidence-Based Interventions 
To Support Breastfeeding.”‍ In a 
comprehensive evidence review 
for the US Preventive Services 
Task Force, Chung et al30 provided 
evidence that breastfeeding 
interventions, including both pre- 
and postnatal interventions, were 
more influential than either alone 
and that interventions including a 
component of lay support, such as 
peer counselors, are more effective 
than usual care in increasing short- 
and long-term breastfeeding rates. 
The US Preventive Services Task 
Force recommends interventions 
during pregnancy and after birth to 
support breastfeeding and concludes 
that coordinated interventions can 
increase breastfeeding initiation, 
duration, and exclusivity (Evidence 
Grade B).31

Because of the importance of 
breastfeeding to maternal and infant 
health outcomes, all pediatric care 
providers should aim to improve 
breastfeeding rates in their practices, 
with the goal of achieving the AAP 
breastfeeding recommendations 
for exclusive breastfeeding until 
approximately 6 months, followed 
by continued breastfeeding for 1 
year or longer, as mutually desired 
by the mother and infant.1 Pediatric 
care providers should help mothers 
identify and reach their own 
breastfeeding goals.
The following evidence-based 
recommendations for the pediatric 
outpatient practice should be 
considered as part of the practice-
improvement process to increase 
breastfeeding rates to meet or exceed 
the AAP recommendations and the 
Healthy People 2020 goals. These 
recommendations provide guidance 
for clinical care and are not intended 
to imply a standard of care, nor does 
this report provide a strict weighing 
of the evidence:
1. Establish a written 
breastfeeding-friendly office 
policy that includes the 
provisions as outlined in this 
document and in Table 3.27, 
 
32,

Provide a lactation room with

Relevant Steps in the US Surgeon General’s Call to Action to Support Breastfeeding
1. Give mothers the support they need to breastfeed their infants.
6. Ensure that the marketing of infant formula is conducted in a way that minimizes its negative impacts 
on exclusive breastfeeding.
8. Develop systems to guarantee continuity of skilled support for lactation between hospitals and health 
care settings in the community.
9. Provide education and training in breastfeeding for all health professionals who care for women and 
children.
10. Include basic support for breastfeeding as a standard of care for midwives, obstetricians, family 
physicians, nurse practitioners, and pediatricians.
11. Ensure access to services provided by IBCLCs.
Shown are action steps that apply directly to the pediatric outpatient practice, numbered according to the original steps 
in the Call to Action.8

supplies for employees who 
breastfeed or express breast milk 
at work. This room could also be 
used by breastfeeding mothers 
(refer to recommendation 12). 
Collaborate with the entire team, 
including colleagues and office 
staff. All employees should be 
aware of the policy, and copies 
of the policy should be provided 
to all staff, including anyone 
who answers the telephone or 
retrieves messages, such as front 
office staff. 
2. Train staff in the skills necessary 
to support breastfeeding, 
especially nurses and medical 
assistants.33 Identify ≥1 
breastfeeding resource 
personnel on staff. If possible, 
consider employing an 
International Board Certified 
Lactation Consultant (IBCLC), or 
a nurse or other staff member 
trained in lactation support. 
Trained staff members may be 
able to perform much of the 
routinely provided breastfeeding 
support under the guidance 
of the pediatrician or other 
health care provider. The staff 
should be aware of community 
resources, including IBCLCs 
and other lactation support 
personnel, especially if one is  
not available in the practice  
(see recommendation 15).
3. Become knowledgeable 
regarding the rare but 
true contraindications to 
breastfeeding, which include 
infants with the classic form of 
galactosemia, maternal HIV or 
antiretroviral therapy, untreated 
active tuberculosis, human T-cell 
lymphotropic virus type I or II, 
use of illicit drugs, or mothers 
undergoing chemotherapy or 
radiation treatment.34 Most 
maternal medications are 
compatible with breastfeeding. 
Specific drug information can 
be verified through the National 
Institutes of Health Toxicology 
Data Network, LactMed, which 
is accessible online or through a 
mobile device application.35
4. Introduce the subject of 
breastfeeding as early as 
possible, ideally with prenatal 
visits and early postpartum 
visits.27 Use open-ended 
questions to inquire about 
feeding plans for the child, such 
as “What are your thoughts 
about feeding your baby?”‍ or 
“Tell me about your previous 
infant feeding experiences.”‍ 
Encourage attendance by both 
parents and/or partners at all 
visits, and consider discussions 
with grandparents or other 
important decision-makers in 
the family.36
5. Encourage breastfeeding 
mothers to feed newborn infants 
only human milk and to avoid 
offering supplements, including 
formula, glucose water, or 
other liquids, unless medically 
indicated.1 This education 
ideally should begin prenatally, 
in anticipation of the newborn 
infant’s stay in the maternity 
hospital, and should continue 
through the early postnatal 
visits.
6. Work with committees 
within the local hospital or 
birthing center to implement 
breastfeeding-friendly care.1, 
 
17, 
 
18  
Provide the hospital or birthing 
center with your office policies 
regarding breastfeeding. If 
the facility is not aware of the 
WHO/United Nations Children’s 
Fund Ten Steps to Successful 
Breastfeeding, the pediatrician 
can provide education and 
help to develop breastfeeding-
friendly order sets for the 
hospital. Encourage the facility 
to pursue the Baby-Friendly USA 
designation so that mothers and 
infants are exposed to maternal 
and newborn care that supports 
and encourages breastfeeding, 
beginning with skin-to-skin care 
in the immediate postpartum 
period and early initiation of 
breastfeeding.20 Show support 
for breastfeeding during 
hospital rounds by reinforcing 
the benefits of breastfeeding, 
encouraging exclusive 
breastfeeding, educating about 
the importance of frequent 
breastfeeding, and assessing 
the adequacy of breastfeeding. 
During rounds, either evaluate 
a feeding directly or review 
the chart for documentation of 
adequacy of feeding. Encourage 
mothers to attend breastfeeding 
classes. Advocate for lactation 
consultation for mothers 
who are experiencing any 
breastfeeding problems or who 
have concerns.

7. Schedule the first newborn visit 
by the third to fifth day of life, 
or approximately 24 to 48 hours 
from the time the newborn 
infant is discharged depending 
on the length of the hospital 
stay. At office visits, incorporate 
anticipatory guidance that 
supports exclusive breastfeeding 
until infants are approximately 
6 months old, followed by 
continued breastfeeding for 
1 year or longer, as mutually 
desired by the infant and 
mother.1 Anticipatory guidance 
should include appropriate 
guidance about weight-gain 
expectations with the use of 
appropriate growth charts, 
such as the WHO growth 
standards for ages 0 to 2 years 
recommended by the CDC.37
8. Educate mothers regarding 
the provisions of the Patient 
Protection and Affordable 
Care Act (Pub L No. 111-148 
[2010]), which cover access to 
breastfeeding support services, 
breaks to breastfeed or pump 
at work, as applicable, 
38 and the 
ability to obtain breast pumps 
through insurance.39
9. Provide mothers with 
anticipatory guidance about 
returning to work. Workplace 
support in the pediatric practice 
and in other work environments 
can be optimized through the 
implementation of guidance 
from the Health Resources 
and Services Administration 
Maternal and Child Health 
Bureau’s Business Case for 
Breastfeeding.32 Provide 
information and education 
to mothers about both the 
expression and the storage of 
human milk, which may include 
providing parents with handouts 
detailing the recommendations 
regarding expression and 
storage.40
10. Have the front office staff 
advise the family, when the 
first follow-up appointment is 
scheduled, that the pediatrician 
or other trained office staff may 
wish to observe a feeding during 
the first visit, so that the family 
will be aware. Encourage the 
family to let the staff know when 
the infant is ready to feed while 
waiting for the appointment. 
For the first and subsequent 
appointments, feedings should 
be observed when the mother 
identifies any breastfeeding 
problem, or if weight gain is not 
appropriate.
11. Provide appropriate educational 
resources for parents.41, 
 
42 
These resources could cover, 
at a minimum, the benefits of 
breastfeeding for mother and 
child, AAP recommendations 
for duration of breastfeeding, 
education regarding feeding 
cues, how to tell whether the 
infant is getting enough milk, 
latch and holding techniques, 
and a list of peer support 
groups and local breastfeeding 
resources. The literature should 
be culturally sensitive and 
appropriate for the literacy of 
the patient population. Consider 
linking to appropriate resources 
on the practice Web site. Avoid 
distributing literature provided 
by manufacturers of infant 
formula.
12. Allow and encourage 
breastfeeding in the waiting 
room.33 Display noncommercial 
posters and pamphlets 
that encourage mothers to 
breastfeed in waiting areas and 
examination rooms. Include 
graphics that show diversity 
and include fathers, who 
are valuable partners in the 
success of the breastfeeding 
dyad. Do not interrupt or 
discourage breastfeeding, either 
in the waiting room or in the 
examination room. Provide a 
comfortable, private area for 
mothers to breastfeed if they 
prefer privacy. This room may 
include a rocking chair, pillows, 
music, water fountain, or 
whatever helps to create a warm 
and relaxing environment. An 
examination room may suffice as 
a private room for breastfeeding.
13. Eliminate the practice of 
distribution of free formula  
and other infant items from 
formula companies to parents.43, 
 
44  
In accordance with the WHO 
International Code of Marketing 
of Breast-milk Substitutes, 
45 
the storage of formula supplies, 
which may be purchased by 
the practice as applicable for 
formula-fed infants, should be 
out of the view of patients. The 
breastfeeding-friendly pediatric 
office practice should not accept 
gifts (formula and other feeding 
supplies, pens, writing pads, 
calendars, mugs, etc) from 
companies manufacturing infant 
formula, feeding bottles, or 
pacifiers. Consumer publications 
that advertise infant formula or 
have tear-off cards or inserts 
to receive free or discounted 
formula should be discouraged.
14. Train staff to follow telephone 
triage protocols to address 
breastfeeding concerns 
and problems. Train staff 
on providing appropriate 
breastfeeding telephone advice, 
including when to refer to 
an IBCLC or to a physician 
with special expertise in 
breastfeeding management.46 
Telehealth consults may be an 
option in some locations.
15. Acquire or maintain a list of 
community resources and be 
knowledgeable about referral 
procedures. Refer expectant and 
new parents to peer, community 
support, and resource groups.33 
Get to know peer and community 
support groups in your area. WIC 
breastfeeding support services, 
La Leche League International, 
and peer counselors are

some options. Not all groups 
may provide evidence-based 
information, so it is useful if 
the pediatric care provider 
or members of the clinic staff 
have attended and maintain 
good communication with the 
leaders of these support groups. 
Consider inviting successfully 
breastfeeding mothers to join 
any advisory groups associated 
with the practice.
16. Frenulum clipping of the 
tongue/upper lip has become 
a popular practice, which may 
improve infant latch and the 
effectiveness of breastfeeding 
and milk transfer. Work closely 
with local lactation consultants 
or breastfeeding specialists 
to determine if frenotomy 
is appropriate. If so, refer 
to otolaryngologists and/or 
dentists with experience in 
clipping the frenulum in a timely 
fashion, if the physicians in the 
practice do not perform the 
procedure.
17. Collaborate with the obstetric 
community to develop optimal 
breastfeeding support programs, 
because it is clearly documented 
that a mother’s decision to 
breastfeed starts in the prenatal 
period and, in many cases, before 
pregnancy.10, 
 
36
18. Provide support and education 
to local child care centers on 
the importance of breastfeeding 
and the handling, storage, and 
feeding of expressed human 
milk.47
19. Monitor breastfeeding initiation 
and duration rates in the 
pediatric practice. Be able to 
access state and national trends 
as tracked by the CDC through 
the National Immunization 
Survey11 and hospital practices 
through the Maternity Practices 
in Infant Nutrition and Care 
biannual survey data.48

BREAStFEEDINg-FRIENDLy OFFICE 
pRACtICES
There are challenges to implementing 
the steps as outlined above for the 
breastfeeding-friendly pediatric 
office practice. Breastfeeding care 
delivered by physicians in the 
outpatient practice may be limited by 
lack of knowledge, skills, time, and 
cultural sensitivity.23 Breastfeeding 
management and counseling can 
be both time consuming and labor 
intensive. In many health care 
systems, especially in the United 
States, practice revenue currently is 
dependent on volume of visits and 
patients seen instead of the outcomes 
of those patients. The AAP Section 
on Breastfeeding has developed a 
guide on coding and billing49 as a 
tool to optimize reimbursement 
for time spent in breastfeeding 
support in the office. Coding 
guidance also is available through 
the American College of Obstetricians 
and Gynecologists for maternal 
conditions.50 If additional office 
visits are required beyond those 
covered for well-child visits, then 
diagnosis codes should be used for 
conditions such as jaundice, newborn 
feeding problem, infection associated 
with lactation, etc. Extended visits 
that require repeated evaluation 
of breastfeeding and extensive 
counseling should be billed according 
to time-based codes.
Even if payment were not an 
issue, time constraints may be. 
Complicated breastfeeding problems 
may require immediate attention 
and can monopolize staff time 
and space. Some of these more 
complex issues may exceed the 
knowledge level or skill set of the 
general pediatric care provider. 
Identifying health care providers 
and lactation support personnel 
in the community as sources for 
referral is important for timely 
intervention. Lactation support 
personnel may be limited in certain 
geographic distributions, especially 
rural areas, as well as in certain 
communities. There are different 
skill levels among lactation support 
personnel. These may include, 
among others, volunteer or paid 
peer counselors, lactation educators, 
certified lactation counselors, 
IBCLCs, and breastfeeding medicine 
specialists. The extent of training 
required by the lactation specialist 
may vary depending on the needs 
of the mother and/or infant and the 
particular clinical or community 
setting. There exists a need for 
greater availability of culturally 
appropriate and ethnically diverse 
lactation support personnel in a 
variety of community and health 
care settings. Home visitation, 
where available, is a family-friendly 
way to provide lactation support. 
Pediatric care providers need to 
be knowledgeable about common 
complications that can affect both 
mother and infant and either treat 
these conditions in the mother or 
become aware of obstetrician/
gynecologists, family physicians, or 
breastfeeding medicine specialists in 
the community who are comfortable 
and knowledgeable in treating the 
maternal conditions. 
Clearly, there will be obstacles to 
implementing the steps outlined in 
this report; however, these obstacles 
are not insurmountable. With 
ongoing advocacy for the support of 
breastfeeding, there should be fewer 
barriers over time.
FURthER RESEARCh
It would be valuable to study the 
cost-effectiveness and impact of 
the routine presence of trained 
lactation support personnel, such 
as IBCLCs, versus no specific 
lactation support in the outpatient 
pediatric practice on breastfeeding 
exclusivity and duration. In addition, 
further research is needed on 
the effectiveness and intensity of 
other interventions to support 
breastfeeding, such as in-person

consultation, group sessions, online 
resources, or use of telehealth, as well 
as community support interventions. 
Another area for research is the best 
method for improving pediatric care 
provider education in breastfeeding 
management and support during 
undergraduate and graduate medical 
education, as well as continuing 
medical education for practicing 
physicians. Education of other 
members of the health care team  
who may interact with breastfeeding  
mothers or children is also important. 
Finally, similar to the research  
published in Pediatrics entitled  
“Evaluation of an Office Protocol To  
Increase Exclusivity of Breastfeeding, 
”‍28  
in which the authors evaluated 
the ABM’s clinical protocol for the 
Breastfeeding-Friendly Physician’s 
Office, 
27 an evaluation of the impact 
of implementation in pediatric office 
practices of the steps outlined in this 
clinical report on rates of exclusive 
breastfeeding and duration of 
breastfeeding would be beneficial.
CONCLUSIONS
The benefits of breastfeeding and the 
potential risks of not breastfeeding 
are numerous, and increasing 
breastfeeding initiation, duration, 
and exclusivity has been the focus 
of multiple recent initiatives in the 
health care setting, workplace, and 
community, as recommended by 
the Surgeon General’s Call to Action 
To Support Breastfeeding. With 
national goals as outlined in Healthy 
People 2020, an increase in overall 
breastfeeding initiation, and more 
Baby-Friendly–designated hospitals, 
the need for increased support from 
all members of the health care team 
is clear. The pediatric care provider 
is well suited to play a primary role 
in this effort. The steps outlined in 
this document provide clear and 
concise ways for the pediatric office 
practice to support breastfeeding 
mothers, infants, and families; 
increase breastfeeding exclusivity 
and duration in their patients; and 
improve health outcomes for the 
population.
