Abstract
Background: The glycolytic nature of cancer cells presents a potential treatment target that may be addressed by a
ketogenic diet (KD).
Objective: We hypothesized that a KD would improve body composition and lower serum insulin and insulin-like growth
factor-I (IGF-I) in women with ovarian or endometrial cancer.
Methods: In this randomized controlled trial, women with ovarian or endometrial cancer [age: ≥19 y; body mass
index (kg/m2): ≥18.5] were randomly assigned to a KD (70:25:5 energy from fat, protein, and carbohydrate) or the
American Cancer Society diet (ACS; high-fiber, low-fat). Body composition (DXA) and fasting serum insulin, IGF-I,
and β-hydroxybutyrate were obtained at baseline and at 12 wk; urinary ketones were also measured throughout the
intervention. We assessed differences between the diets with ANCOVA and independent t tests. We used correlation
analyses to estimate associations between changes in serum analytes and body composition.
Results: After 12 wk, the KD (compared with ACS) group had lower adjusted total (35.3 compared with 38.0 kg,
P < 0.05) and android (3.0 compared with 3.3 kg, P < 0.05) fat mass. Percentage of change in visceral fat was greater
in the KD group (compared with the ACS group; –21.2% compared with –4.6%, P < 0.05). Adjusted total lean mass
did not differ between the groups. The KD (compared with ACS) group had lower adjusted fasting serum insulin (7
.6
compared with 11.2 µU/mL, P < 0.01). There was a significant inverse association between the changes in serum
β-hydroxybutyrate and IGF-I concentrations (r = –0.57; P < 0.0001).
Conclusions: In women with ovarian or endometrial cancer, a KD results in selective loss of fat mass and retention of
lean mass. Visceral fat mass and fasting serum insulin also are reduced by the KD, perhaps owing to enhanced insulin
sensitivity. Elevated serum β-hydroxybutyrate may reflect a metabolic environment inhospitable to cancer proliferation.

Introduction
A growing body of research suggests that cancer is a metabolic
disease. Cancer cells preferentially metabolize glucose for
energy via glycolysis, even in the presence of oxygen (i.e., the
Warburg effect). Compared with oxidative phosphorylation
used by normal cells, aerobic glycolysis is relatively inefficient
in terms of ATP produced per mole of glucose (1, 2).
Accordingly, cancer cells require high amounts of glucose for
proliferation, making them vulnerable under conditions of
glucose deprivation.
Although cancer cells rely on glucose for fuel, blood glucose
concentrations in healthy individuals are tightly regulated,
suggesting that there are other factors facilitating cancer cells’
uptake of glucose. Insulin is perhaps one such factor. This
hormone is secreted in response to carbohydrate intake and
induces the uptake of glucose by normal and cancer cells alike
(3). Cancer cells are disproportionately populated by insulin
receptors, which enables them to obtain sufficient glucose,
even in the presence of normal glucose concentrations (4). In
addition, insulin and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), a
hormone that has sequence homology with insulin, also may
promote cancer cell proliferation via insulin receptor–mediated
activation of MAPK and phosphatydalinositol-3 kinase (5, 6).
Cancer cells’dependence on glucose and insulin for growth
and replication represents a cancer treatment target that may be
addressed by a very low-carbohydrate, high-fat (i.e., ketogenic)

 diet. This manipulation of macronutrients shifts the body’
s
fuel source from carbohydrate to fat, which presents a 3-fold
disadvantage to cancer cells: 1) owing to their dependence on
aerobic glycolysis, many types of cancer cells lack the capacity to
use fat as an energy source; 2) most cancer cells are also unable
to metabolize the ketone bodies produced as a by-product of
fatty acid metabolism (7); and 3) these ketone bodies also may
inhibit cancer cells’glycolytic metabolism, thereby diminishing
growth (8).
Ketogenic diets (KDs) have been used as a therapy for a
variety of neurologic diseases in humans, most extensively in
epilepsy, as well as for metabolic disorders such as type 2 dia-
betes (T2D) (9). These diets generally produce a more favorable
metabolic profile than low-fat diets (2, 10–13). In particular,
KDs have been shown to decrease IGF-I and 24-h plasma
glucose and increase insulin sensitivity (11, 12). Carbohydrate
restriction also selectively diminishes metabolically hazardous
adipose depots while maintaining lean mass (14, 15).
Although animal models have demonstrated that diet
modification can yield profound effects, such as preventing
cancer initiation, inhibiting tumor growth, enhancing the effects
of radiation and chemotherapy, and prolonging survival (16–
22), few studies have assessed the effects of KDs in humans with
cancer. The limited evidence available suggests that KDs are
safe, feasible, and may contribute to improved or stable disease
status among cancer patients (23–27).
Ovarian and endometrial cancer are among the most deadly
female cancer types in the United States (28) and both are
associated with obesity (29, 30). The link between obesity and
some cancer types involves glucose, insulin, and IGF-I, all of
which are increased in obesity (31, 32). Indeed, epidemiologic
studies provide strong evidence for the involvement of the
insulin-IGF axis in several obesity-related cancers (33–37),
although data are somewhat limited for endometrial and
ovarian cancer specifically. However, overexpression of insulin
and IGF-I receptors has been observed in both of these cancer
types (38–40). Accordingly, an insulin-lowering KD may
diminish growth factors needed for proliferation in ovarian
and endometrial cancers. The objective of this study was to
examine the effects of 12 wk of treatment with either the KD
or the lower-fat American Cancer Society diet (ACS) on body
composition and biochemical analytes in women with ovarian
or endometrial cancer. Biochemical analytes included: glucose,
insulin, C-peptide (a gauge of pancreatic insulin production),
β-hydroxybutyrate
(a
ketone
indicative
of
fatty
acid
metabolism), IGF-I, and insulin-like growth factor binding
protein 1 (IGFBP-1). We tested the hypothesis that a KD would
improve body composition and lower serum insulin and IGF-I
in this patient population.

at Birmingham (UAB, Birmingham, AL). Participants were women with
ovarian or endometrial cancer, recruited between October 2015 and

April 2017, from the UAB Gynecologic Oncology clinic and from
other treatment centers via physician referral, flyers, local television
advertisements, and news articles. Eligibility criteria were BMI (kg/m2)
≥18.5, age ≥19 y, no pre-existing medical conditions affecting body
weight (other than cancer and associated treatment), not actively
attempting weight loss/gain or diet modification, and no medical
history contraindicating enrollment. Women with T2D were eligible
to participate (4 with T2D completed the study; 3 managed blood
glucose for the duration of the study using only metformin, and
1 used only insulin glargine at baseline but discontinued use after
initiating the KD). UAB’
s Institutional Review Board approved the
study, and all participants provided written informed consent prior to
enrollment.
Protocol and procedures. This study was conducted as a
randomized clinical trial (NCT03171506) with parallel arm design.
Fasting serum concentrations of glucose, insulin, C-peptide, IGF-I,
IGFBP-1, and β-hydroxybutyrate were obtained at baseline and at
12 wk; body composition was measured at these same time points.
Participants were randomly assigned, through the use of a computer-
generated blocked randomization scheme (created by KRF), to either the
ACS or the KD group. Because this was a diet intervention study, it was
not possible for participants or study personnel to be blinded to group
assignment. The project coordinator enrolled and assigned participants
to their interventions.
Diet interventions. The ACS diet consisted of general guidelines to
encourage intake of antioxidants and fiber, while reducing consumption
of saturated fat and added sugars; these guidelines were based on
recommendations established by the American Cancer Society and
the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (41, 42). The KD had a
macronutrient distribution of ∼5% of energy from carbohydrate (≤20
g/d), 25% energy from protein (≤100 g/d), and 70% energy from fat
(≥125 g/d). Carbohydrate foods were limited to nonstarchy vegetables
such as salad greens, broccoli, and summer squash. Permitted protein
foods included meat, poultry, eggs, and fish, provided that they were
neither breaded nor battered. Fat-containing foods included olive and
coconut oils, avocados, butter, olives, cheese, cream, and small amounts
of nuts. KD participants were instructed to avoid all grains and grain
products, starchy vegetables, and fruit. Total energy intake was not
restricted for either the ACS or KD.
A registered dietitian provided diet-specific nutrition education
to each participant immediately after baseline testing. Additional
counseling was provided via phone and e-mail on a weekly basis, and
included distribution of sample meal plans and recipes. When necessary,
based on feedback from the participant, diet recommendations were
further individualized to enhance adherence, assessed via weekly food
record reviews. In addition, KD participants were also asked to measure
urinary ketones with Ketostix (Bayer AG, Leverkusen, Germany). They
submitted smartphone photographs of their strips via e-mail daily for
the first 2 wk, and thereafter on a weekly basis.
Body composition. Total body fat, lean mass, and visceral fat
were measured by DXA with the use of a Lunar iDXA densitometer
[GE Medical Systems, Madison, WI, enCORE Version 15 (SP2)].
Participants were required to wear light clothing, remove all metal
objects, and lie supine with arms at their sides during the scan.
Serum chemistry. Glucose was measured with a SIRRUS analyzer
(Stanbio Laboratory, Boerne, TX); intra-assay CV of 1.3% and
interassay CV of 2.5%. Insulin was assayed by immunofluorescence
through the use of the TOSOH AIA-II analyzer (TOSOH Corp, South
San Francisco, CA); intra-assay CV of 1.5% and interassay CV of 4.0%.
C-peptide was assayed by immunofluorescence through the use of the
TOSOH analyzer; intra-assay CV of 1.7% and interassay CV of 6.8%.
β-hydroxybutyrate was measured with a SIRRUS analyzer (Stanbio
Laboratory, Boerne, TX) by colorimetric assay; intra-assay CV of 5.2%
and interassay CV of 3.0%. IGF-I was measured by ELISA (American
Laboratory Products Company, Salem, NH); intra-assay CV of 4.4%
and interassay CV of 6.1%. IGFBP-1 was also measured by ELISA

Statistical methods. Descriptive statistics were calculated for all
study variables. Visceral fat was log10 transformed to ensure a normal
distribution. All statistical tests were 2-sided, with an α level of 0.05
denoting statistical significance. Statistical analyses were performed
with SAS (version 9.4; SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Sample size calculations
were based on the change in fasting insulin during a previous diet
intervention in which a decrease of 2.7 ± 4.6 µU/mL was detected after
8 wk of consumption of a reduced-carbohydrate diet (43). Statistical
power analysis indicated that 25 individuals per group were required
to have 80% power to detect a 2.7 ± 4.6 µU/mL difference in fasting
insulin, through the use of a 2-sided paired t test and a significance alpha
level of 0.05. ANCOVA was used to compare the effects of the study
diets on body composition and biochemical analytes, through the use
of baseline values and the change in total fat mass and/or the change in
weight as covariates where appropriate. Independent t tests were used
to determine the effect of the diet on percentage of change in visceral
fat, to assess differences between diet groups for baseline demographic
variables, and to compare participants who did with those who did not
complete the study. Pearson correlation analyses were used to estimate
associations between body composition and biochemical analytes. One
outlier (>3 SDs above the mean on fasting insulin concentration) was
excluded from insulin-related analyses. In addition, 1 participant who
was using exogenous insulin at baseline but not at 12 wk was excluded
from all insulin analyses. One outlier (>3 SDs above the mean on
IGFBP-1 and IGF-I) was also excluded from analyses involving IGFBP-
1 and IGF-I. Visceral fat mass data were not available for 5 participants
who exceeded the DXA limits for body width. Serum samples were not
available for 2 participants in the KD group.

conflicts, 2 women died during the study, 3 women experienced
a cancer recurrence and no longer wished to participate, and 3
women no longer wanted to comply with their assigned diet.
In all, 6 women from each diet group discontinued the study.
Those who withdrew did not differ from participants who
completed the trial on BMI or fat mass at baseline. However,
dropouts were younger (P = 0.01) than those who completed
the study. Baseline characteristics of the 45 study participants
by diet group are shown in Table 1. The groups did not
differ in age, racial distribution, BMI, cancer type, percentage
of patients receiving concurrent chemotherapy, number of
previous chemotherapies, or time since initial cancer diagnosis.
Dietary adherence. KD participants were expected to achieve
urinary ketone concentrations of ∼0.5 mmol/L, as indicated
by a relative color change on the Ketostix; 20 of the 25 KD
participants (80%) achieved this level of ketosis within the first
3 wk of the diet intervention. Based on communications with
the study dietitian and regular food record reviews, ∼80% of
all participants were considered adherent to their assigned diets.
Body composition. Table 2 and Figure 2 show body compo-
sition results by diet. At 12 wk, those randomly assigned to the
KD had significantly less total body fat, android fat, and visceral
fat after adjusting for the baseline condition (P < 0.05 for all).
The percentage of change in visceral fat mass was also greater in
the KD group than in the ACS group (–21.2% compared with
–4.6%, P < 0.05). In contrast, adjusted lean mass did not differ
significantly between groups at 12 wk. Although there were

addition, the adjusted serum β-hydroxybutyrate concentration
after the diet intervention was significantly higher in the KD
group than in the ACS group (P < 0.001). The groups did not
significantly differ in the adjusted mean at 12 wk for IGF-I or

Correlation analyses. Correlation analyses revealed a signifi-
cant positive association between the change in android fat and
change in the fasting serum insulin concentration (r = 0.32,
P < 0.05) (Figure 3). A similar positive association was observed
between the change in visceral fat and change in fasting serum
insulin concentration (r = 0.33, P < 0.05). In addition, there
was a significant inverse association between the change in
serum β-hydroxybutyrate and the change in IGF-I (r = –0.57,
P < 0.0001).
Discussion
Cancer cells’ dependence on aerobic glycolysis renders them
vulnerable in situations of glucose and insulin deprivation.
Accordingly, diets that limit carbohydrates such as a KD may
provide a nonpharmacologic means of disrupting cancer cell
growth and replication. In this investigation, we tested the
hypothesis that a KD would improve body composition and
lower insulin and IGF-I in women with ovarian or endometrial
cancer. Our results indicated that, compared with the ACS diet,
the KD resulted in lower total body fat, android fat, and visceral
fat, while maintaining lean mass. Those in the KD group also
demonstrated lower serum insulin and C-peptide, independent
of weight loss. Finally, a greater degree of ketosis, as indicated
by higher concentrations of serum β-hydroxybutyrate, was
associated with lower IGF-I. In aggregate, these findings suggest
that the KD creates a metabolic environment that is not
supportive of cancer proliferation.
We found that the KD decreased fat mass in several
fat depots, including visceral fat. Previous studies examining
the effects of carbohydrate restriction on body composition
have generated similar results in various patient populations.
Specifically, a lower-carbohydrate diet (40–43% of total energy)
decreased total fat and intra-abdominal adipose tissue to a
greater extent than a low-fat diet in women with polycystic
ovary syndrome as well as in overweight adults at risk of
T2D (14, 15). Studies examining KDs have also demonstrated

significant reductions in fat mass, particularly in the visceral
and android regions, in overweight and obese adults (44–46).
Visceral fat is widely noted for its association with increased
cardiometabolic risk, but recent evidence also suggests that this
type of adipose tissue may likewise increase cancer risk (47,
48). A potential mechanism connecting visceral adiposity and
cancer could relate to visceral fat’
s secretion of proinflammatory
cytokines, which may contribute to insulin resistance and
a subsequent elevation of proliferative growth factors (49).
Thus, given the potential adverse effects associated with central
obesity, depletion of visceral and android fat may shift body
composition toward a profile that coincides with favorable
metabolic health.

 The substantial losses of total and visceral fat in the KD
group were not accompanied by a concurrent loss of lean
mass. We found no significant difference between groups in
lean mass after 12 wk of the dietary intervention. Accordingly,
the KD appeared to have induced a selective depletion of fat
mass and retention of lean mass. These findings contribute to a
growing body of literature indicating that the maintenance of
lean body mass during weight loss may respond in part to diet
composition. For example, in obese young men, progressively
greater total and relative body fat were lost as the carbohydrate
content of the diet was decreased, such that at the highest level
of carbohydrate restriction, 95% of the weight lost was fat, and
thus loss of lean mass was minimal (50). Furthermore, 6 wk
of low-carbohydrate diet resulted in an increase in lean body
mass in healthy men, despite no change in physical activity; the
entire loss of body weight was from body fat (51). Similarly, in
cancer patients receiving concurrent radiotherapy, a KD induced
a loss of fat mass while preserving fat-free mass (52). A lower-
carbohydrate diet may protect lean mass by lowering insulin,
which is associated with greater loss of lean mass during energy
deficit (53). In addition, the elevation of blood ketones may
contribute to the preservation of lean mass by providing an
alternate fuel source to the brain and other tissues, thereby
limiting the use of amino acids from muscle as a substrate for
gluconeogenesis (54). It is worth noting that such preservation
of lean mass is of particular importance in cancer patients, a
population in which the incidence of sarcopenia is high (55).
In addition to these improvements in body composition,
we also found significant changes in biochemical parameters,
including fasting insulin and C-peptide. The KD resulted in
lower fasting insulin in comparison to the ACS diet, a trend
that has been observed previously in murine models (56, 57).
This reduction in fasting insulin suggests that a KD may
improve insulin sensitivity. We also observed that there was a
significant positive association between the change in fasting
insulin concentration and the change in android fat. The precise
mechanism underlying this relation is unclear, but it may
involve improved insulin sensitivity, which has been observed
with the KD (11). Increased insulin sensitivity, as observed with
use of the insulin-sensitizing thiazolidinedione drugs, results in a
redistribution of lipid from ectopic to peripheral adipose tissue
depots (58). Thus, it is plausible that both the decrease in insulin
and the selective depletion of visceral fat are manifestations of
improved insulin sensitivity (i.e., share a common antecedent).
Elevated concentrations of IGF-I have been associated with
several common cancer types (34, 36), potentially due to its
mitogenic and antiapoptotic effects. In our sample, there was a
trend toward significance for lower IGF-I on the KD compared
with the ACS diet. Further, as seen in Figure 3, there was a
significant inverse association between the change in serum β-
hydroxybutyrate and the change in IGF-I. Variation in serum
β-hydroxybutyrate among participants may have been due in
part to variations in dietary intake (e.g., degree of carbohydrate
restriction or glycemic load), or perhaps in part to individuals’
unique metabolic proclivity or resistance to achieving higher
levels of ketosis. The importance of achieving ketosis was
demonstrated in a small pilot study where cancer remission
by 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography
was directly related to blood ketone concentrations (25). Hence,
research is needed to understand variation in the serum β-
hydroxybutyrate response to the KD.
This study has several strengths. To our knowledge, this is the
first randomized controlled trial examining the effects of a KD
for cancer in humans. Furthermore, we conducted DXA scans
on all participants, allowing us to quantify diet effects on total
and regional body composition. The primary limitation of this
study was the heterogeneous nature of the sample. Participants
varied in cancer type, stage, treatment history, and concurrent
chemotherapy status, which may have influenced the results. In
addition, we did not provide the food for participants, which
detracts from our ability to better control dietary intake and
adherence but enhances the generalizability of our results. This
study also did not include healthy control participants, which
would have allowed for the comparison of the KD’
s effects in
cancer-free women. Finally, our protocol lacked a measure of
insulin sensitivity.
In summary, among women with ovarian or endometrial
cancer, a 12-wk KD produced selective loss of total and visceral
fat, maintenance of lean body mass, and decreases in cancer-
related growth factors. Further study in a clinical setting is
needed to determine whether the KD may be an effective
nonpharmacologic adjuvant therapy for cancer.
