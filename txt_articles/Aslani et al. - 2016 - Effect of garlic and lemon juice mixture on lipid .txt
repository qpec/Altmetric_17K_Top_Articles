ABSTRACT
Background: This study was performed to effects of garlic and lemon juice mixture on lipid profile 
and some cardiovascular risk factors in people 30–60 years old with moderate hyperlipidemia.
Methods: In a parallel‑designed randomized controlled clinical trial, a total of 112 hyperlipidemic 
patients 30–60 years, were recruited from Isfahan Cardiovascular Research Center. People were 
selected and randomly divided into four groups. Control blood samples were taken and height, 
weight, and blood pressure were recorded. (1) Received 20 g of garlic daily, plus 1 tablespoon 
lemon juice, (2) received 20 g garlic daily, (3) received 1 tablespoon of lemon juice daily, and 
(4) did not receive garlic or lemon juice. A study technician was done the random allocations 
using a random numbers table. All participants presented 3 days of dietary records and 3 days 
of physical activity records during 8 weeks. Blood samples were obtained at study baseline and 
after 8 weeks of intervention.
Results: Results showed a significant decrease in total cholesterol (changes from baseline: 
40.8 ± 6.1, P < 0.001), low‑density lipoprotein‑cholesterol (29.8 ± 2.6, P < 0.001), and fibrinogen 
(111.4 ± 16.1, P < 0.001) in the Group 1, in comparison with other groups. A greater reduction 
in systolic and diastolic blood pressure was observed in Group 1 compared with the Groups 3 
and 4 (37 ± 10, P = 0.01) (24 ± 1, P = 0.02); respectively. Furthermore, a great reduction in 
body mass index was observed in the mixed group compared with the lemon juice and control 
groups (1.6 ± 0.1, P = 0.04).
Conclusions: Administration of garlic plus lemon juice resulted in an improvement in lipid levels, 
fibrinogen and blood pressure of patients with hyperlipidemia.
Keywords: Cardiovascular disease, garlic, hypercholesterolemic patient, lemon juice

INTRODUCTION
Cardiovascular 
diseases 
(CVDs) 
are 
multifactorial 
disorders which are characterized by multiple metabolic 
dysfunctions. 
Epidemiologic 
studies 
indicate 
that 
increased 
serum 
lipids 
profiles, 
elevated 
plasma 
fibrinogen, and coagulation factors play critical roles.[1] 
CVDs are the major cause of mortality and morbidity 
in the world. Unfortunately, they lead to 17 million 
deaths every year. It has been estimated that this number 
will reach 24.8 million people in 2030 worldwide.[2] 
CVDs are considered to be the most common cause of 
death (25–45% mortality) and the fifth most common 
cause of disability.[3] According to the World Health 
Organization statistics, the most important risk factors 
include tobacco usage, high blood pressure, alcoholism, 
high cholesterol, low fruit, and vegetable consumption, 
lack of appropriate physical activity and obesity.[1] Iran 
is the fifth country, throughout the world in terms of 
having high blood pressure related diseases.[4] High blood 
pressure and risk factors in CVDs are the main causes of 
death and mortality in Iran and according to the report 
of Iranian Health Profile Survey in 1999, the prevalence 
of blood pressure in adults over 30 years increased by 
12–45%.[5] Previous studies showed that 46% of the total 
deaths in 18 provinces of Iran were caused by CVD.[6] 
Approximately, 6.6 million people between the ages of 
25–64 have high blood pressure, and it is estimated that 
12 million persons between 25 and 46 years of age 
are at increased risk of CVD.[7] Oxidative stress has a 
pathological role in CVD, particularly its effects on 
low‑density lipoprotein‑cholesterol (LDL‑C) oxidation, 
and eventually leads to inflammation status.[8] Dietary 
factors show a key role in the management of CVD. 
Epidemiologic studies noticed that diets rich in vegetables 
and fruits are affiliated with a lower risk of mortality, 
particularly cardiovascular diseases related deaths.[9,10] It 
has also been indicated that the benefits of vegetable 
and fruit intake appear to be related to CVD.[11] These 
food groups contain different phytochemicals which can 
demonstrate anti‑inflammatory properties. One of the 
most well‑known sources of anti‑CVD phytochemicals 
is garlic, which plays an effective role in the suppression 
and treatment of CVDs.[12] Even though pharmacological 
interventions cause a significant reduction in high 
blood pressure and dyslipidemia, lifestyle modification 
and correcting the dietary regime can be a key step in 
the management of CVD.[13] Among foods which are 
effective in reducing inflammation status and ultimately 
cardiovascular parameters, the use of garlic and lemon 
juice is common. Garlic is used in various forms such 
as raw garlic, powdered garlic tablets, or extracted oil. 
Lipid levels, blood pressure, reactive oxygen species, and 
other cardiovascular risk factors affected by garlic will 
decline that has been confirmed by several studies.[14] 
Epidemiological studies have demonstrated that increased 
consumption of polyphenols such as flavonoids and 
phenylpropanoids phytochemicals that are present in 
fruits and vegetables are associated with reduced risk of 
CVD. Lemon juice is high in 
 erycosytryn and hesperidin 
flavones. Animal studies showed that erycosytryn and 
hesperidin have antioxidant properties, and they can 
decrease oxidative stress.[12] Several studies have been 
conducted concerning the relationship between garlic 
and lemon juice in reducing inflammatory biomarkers 
and lipid levels in patients with CVD, separately. 
However, the effects of garlic and lemon juice mixture 
on the indicators of CVDs have not yet been analyzed. 
Regarding the increasing prevalence of these diseases, we 
examined the effects of garlic and lemon juice mixture 
on some CVD risk factors such as total cholesterol (TC), 
LDL‑C, systolic blood pressure (SBP), and diastolic blood 
pressure (DBP) and fibrinogen in people 30–60 years old 
with moderate hyperlipidemia.
METHODS
Participants
In a parallel‑designed randomized controlled clinical trial, 
hyperlipidemic patients 30–60 years were recruited from 
Isfahan Cardiovascular Research Center (ICRC) from 
November to December 2013. Considering the proposed 
formula for parallel‑design randomized trials, given the 
Type I error of 5%, the study power of 90% considering 
TC as the key variable. The sample size calculation was 
determined,[15] we needed 120 patients to be enrolled. 
Subjects were eligible if they had a fasting TC and 
LDL‑C levels between 200–240 mg/dl and 100–160 mg/
dl, respectively. Participants were excluded if they were 
suffering from any other chronic diseases, including 
heart diseases, kidney failure, lung dysfunction, thyroid 
disorders, gastrointestinal disorders, rheumatoid arthritis, 
and other liver diseases such as hepatitis or fatty liver. 
Participants that were pregnant lactating, or that smoked 
were also excluded. In addition, participants’ body 
weight should not have changed in the last 2 months. 
Subjects were excluded if they were on medication 
which affected blood sugar, lipid profile, blood pressure, 
or anti‑inflammatory markers. Participants should not 
have had any food allergy or sensitivity to garlic or lemon 
juice consumption. Individuals with a history of following 
any special diet (vegetarian/vegan, etc.) were excluded as 
well. From the revision of the medical records available 
in ICRC, 800 patients were chosen. These subjects 
were invited for screening as they met nearly all of the 
inclusion criteria. After the screening process, 120 eligible 
volunteers enrolled into the study and were randomly 
allocated to four groups: (1) Mixed with garlic and lemon 
juice group, (2) garlic group, (3) lemon juice group 
and (4) control group. Of the 120 subjects randomly 
assigned to treatment, two subjects in the control group in 
the beginning of intervention were dropped out from the

study because of their busy schedule and over the duration 
of the study, two subjects in the mixed group because 
of pregnancy and three subjects because of the gastric 
problem were eliminated from this study. One subject in 
the garlic group because of pregnancy and two subjects 
because of travel were eliminated. Finally, 112 subjects 
continued until the end of the study. The participant flow 
diagram is shown in Figure 1. All participants provided 
informed written consent. This trial was approved by the 
Isfahan University of Medical Sciences (392436) and was 
registered in clinical trials center’s website address (www.
irct.ir) (Code: IRCT2015020720986N1).
Study design
In a parallel‑designed randomized controlled clinical trial, 
professor of biostatistics did the random allocations. In 
this study, group blinding was not possible because the 
intervention involved taking or not taking garlic or lemon 
juice. However, laboratory personnel analyzing results 
were blinded. During of the intervention, subjects were 
allowed to continue performing daily diet and activities. 
Group 1 received 20 g of raw garlic daily plus 1 tablespoon 
of lemon juice (n = 30), Group 2 received 20 g garlic 
daily (n = 30), Group 3 received 1 tablespoon of lemon 
juice daily, 2 h after dinner (n = 30), and Group 4 did 
not receive garlic, or lemon juice (n = 30) for 8 weeks. 
Participants were asked to use garlic and lemon juice for 
8 weeks. When the participants were given packets of 
garlic and bottle of lemon juice, we were wanted not to 
change their lifestyle, physical activity, or diet during the 
study. Participants were asked to bring back the empty 
packets and bottles at the final session to help assure 
compliance.
Variables assessment
They were instructed to avoid change in diet and physical 
activity, so their diet and physical activity were similar, and it 
was checked by researchers and their records. All participants 
provided 3 physical activity records (3 days) and 3 dietary 
records (3 days) during the intervention at 0, 4, and 8 weeks. 
They provided 3 days of physical activity records and 3 days 
of dietary records (1 weekend day and 2 weekdays) to certify 
they preserved their usual diet and activity levels during 
the intervention. The presented portion sizes in the dietary 
records were changed to grams. The average amount (g) 
of food intake data, based on 3, 3 days of dietary records, 
was joined with Nutritionist IV software (N‑Squared 
Computing, Cincinnati, OH, USA) to conclude nutrient 
intake data. The nutrient database of Nutritionist IV 
software was based on the United States Department of 
Agriculture food composition table, reclaimed for Iranian 
foods. Physical activity was declared as metabolic equivalents 
per hour per day. To quantify measures of blood sampling 
and metabolic profiles were carried out at study baseline 
and after 8 weeks of intervention.
After overnight fasting, blood samples were collected 
from patients between 7 and 10 am. After centrifuging 
at 4°C at 500 × g for 10 min, tubes were frozen at 
−80°C until analysis.). Fibrinogen was determined by 
latex immunoturbidimetric assay (Bionic, Iran). TC,

triglyceride (TG), high‑density lipoprotein (HDL) were 
measured by photometric enzyme assay (Pars Azmoon, 
Iran) and LDL were measured. Both intra‑ and inter‑assay 
coefficients of variation were <5% for all of the used 
measurement kits. Biochemical parameters were measured 
at baseline and after 8 weeks of the intervention. When 
participants were in the comfortable seat position, after 
10 min rest, blood pressure was measured on the left arm 
using electronic blood monitor. Body weight and height 
were measured with light clothing and without shoes to 
the nearest 0.1 kg and 0.1 cm, respectively and body mass 
index (BMI) was calculated. Except height, other physical 
characteristics and blood pressure were measured 2 times, 
in study week 0, 8, respectively.
Statistical analysis
Data were analyzed using 
 SPSS (version 18, SPSS, Chicago, 
IL, USA), and a two‑sided P < 0.05 was considered to be 
significant. To quantify measures of metabolic profiles, 
blood sampling was done at the beginning of the study 
to establish a baseline and after 8 weeks of intervention. 
To ensure the normal distribution of variables, we applied 
the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. For main effect analysis, 
the difference between the four groups based on outcome 
variables such as dietary intake, physical activity, and 
metabolic profile were compared using ANCOVA test 
controlling for a baseline of these variables and age/
gender. Baseline general characteristics were examined 
using Chi‑square for categorical variables and one‑way 
ANOVA for continuous variables. We used Tukey’s post 
hoc comparisons to identify pairwise differences when we 
reached a significant finding in ANOVA.
RESULTS
From the review of the medical records available in 
ICRC, 800 patients were selected. These subjects 
were called for screening as they met almost all of 
the inclusion criteria. After the screening process, 
120 eligible volunteers enrolled into the study. After 
randomization, 8 person withdrew due to travel (n = 2), 
gastric problem (n = 3), and pregnancy (n = 3). Thus, 
112 subjects completed the study. The mean age of the 
participants was 42.46 ± 8.11 years. None of them were 
consume any nutritional supplement and no one on 
specific medication. The distribution of participants in 
terms of sex, weight, BMI was not significantly different 
between the four intervention groups. The baseline 
characteristics of the 112 subjects are listed in Table 1. 
Comparison of baseline metabolic profiles such as serum 
TC, LDL‑C, HDL‑C, triglyceride and fibrinogen levels, 
SBP and DBP revealed no significant difference between 
the groups. No significant differences were found between 
groups regarding food groups, carbohydrates, saturated 
fatty acids, or the majority of micronutrients as derived 
from the food record. Participants’ physical activity level 
was generally moderate and did not have any strenuous 
exercise. They were instructed to avoid change in their 
physical activity and were checked by researchers. We did 
not find any significant difference in the physical activity 
levels between the four intervention groups. Energy, 
nutrient intake, food groups, and physical activity during 
the intervention period were shown in Table 2.
Changes of all variables within mixed and garlic 
groups were significant before and after intervention 
(P < 0.001). The effects of intervention within groups 
on general characteristics and metabolic profiles are 
shown in Table 3. We found a significant decrease 
in TC, LDL‑C and fibrinogen in the mixed group in 
comparison with other groups (P < 0.001). No significant 
changes were observed regarding serum HDL and 
TG concentration in the mixed group in comparison 
with garlic and lemon juice groups (P = 0.08) but this 
change was significant in mixed group compared with 
control group (P = 0.02) (P = 0.001); respectively. A 
greater reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressure 
was observed in the mixed group compared with the

respectively. Also a great reduction in BMI was observed 
in the mixed group compared with the lemon juice and 
control groups (P = 0.04). No significant differences in 
BMI, systolic and diastolic blood pressure between mixed 
and garlic groups were observed. The effects of a mixture 
of garlic and lemon juice, garlic and lemon juice on general 
characteristics and metabolic profiles are shown in Table 4.
DISCUSSION
Much research has concentrated on garlic for preventing 
atherosclerosis. Multiple useful cardiovascular effects 
have 
been 
discovered 
including 
enhancement 
of 
fibrinolytic activity, lowering of blood pressure, reduction 
in cholesterol, and triglyceride.[14] The results showed 
that combination of garlic and lemon juice significantly 
reduced serum TC, LDL‑C, and blood pressure. Garlic, 
such as many other food additives, gained substantial

interest due to its effects on lipid levels.[16‑18] Moderate 
garlic intake causes few adverse effects. Allergic contact 
dermatitis can happen.[19] Many human and animal studies 
have investigated the effects of garlic on lipid levels, 
fasting blood sugar, BMI, fibrinogen, and SBP and DBP 
but no studies have yet been performed on the effects 
of a combination of garlic and lemon juice consumption 
on these biomarkers. Since 1993, 25 clinical trials have 
been published that have investigated the hypolipidemic 
effects of garlic. Eleven of the studies showed that garlic 
reduced serum cholesterol levels, but fourteen studies 
showed no effect on lowering cholesterol.[10] In addition, 
different extracts of garlic alone have been demonstrated 
to lower serum cholesterol, triglycerides, and LDL in 
rodents and humans.[20,21] Maha and Khalil showed that 
adding 8% raw garlic along with 2% cholesterol to the diet 
of rats decreased plasma TC and LDL‑C.[22] A number 
of human studies have shown that raw garlic favorably 
affects important risk factors for CVD. Consumption has 
been shown to decrease total and LDL‑C and triglyceride 
levels. An intake of the half to one clove of garlic per 
day lowers cholesterol levels approximately 10%.[23,24] 
Mechanisms that explain the observed effects of garlic 
include a decrease in cholesterol absorption, cholesterol, 
and fatty acid synthesis.[25] However, there is some 
evidence that garlic powder does not lower cholesterol 
levels, which may reflect a loss of active compound(s) 
during processing.[26] The formation of these active 
compounds is impressed by crushing garlic, a period of 
the drying process, the temperature at which garlic is 
dried, and humidity.[27] Therefore, we used raw garlic 
in this study. Direct measurements of enzyme activity 
have demonstrated that garlic and various constituents 
prohibit 
human 
 
3‑hydroxy‑3‑methylglutaryl‑coenzyme 
A (HMG‑CoA) reductase and squalene monooxygenase, 
enzymes 
required 
in 
cholesterol 
biosynthesis.[28‑32] 
This prohibition of HMG‑CoA reductase by garlic has 
also been supported in a recent study.[33] In addition, 
LDL‑C reduction by garlic extract may be owing to 
decreases of hepatic 3‑hydroxy‑3‑methylglutaryl‑CoA 
reductase, cholesterol 7α‑hydroxylase, pentose‑phosphate 
pathway activities,[34] cholesteryl ester transfer protein 
activity,[35] microsomal triglyceride transfer protein,[36] 
enhanced bile acid excretion,[37] and prohibition of 
hepatic fatty acid synthesis[38] by allicin and/or other 
components.[28] It should also be emphasized that certain 
garlic preparations (e.g., garlic oils) do not indicate 
the degree of cholesterol lowering seen with specific 
powdered formulations.[39] In this study, we did not 
observe significant changes in HDL‑C levels between 
groups. Aouadi showed that adding 10% fresh crushed 
garlic and 2% cholesterol to diet led to significant 
reduction in LDL‑C levels, and increased HDL‑C 
levels in rats.[40] The present study showed that fasting 
blood glucose showed no significant change due to 
consumption of a combination of garlic and lemon juice. 
However, in the lemon juice group after the intervention, 
we observed a significant increase in fasting blood glucose 
compared with other groups. Mohammadi and Abbas 
showed that fasting blood glucose levels decreased in 
garlic group compared with hypercholesterolemia group, 
but this decrease was not significant.[41] Ali et al.[42] 
reported that garlic administration has no effect on blood 
glucose, similar to this study. In our study, there was a 
significant reduction in mean SBP and DBPs in the garlic 
plus lemon juice group when compared with control and 
lemon juice groups. Since 1993, some studies have been 
published on the effects of garlic on blood pressure.[43‑46] 
In one study has been reported to be moderately reduced 
in blood pressure by garlic alone.[47] In contrast of this, 
a meta‑analysis published in 2001 represented that 
garlic has no considerable effects on blood pressure.[48] 
The moderate subside of blood pressure with garlic may 
be because of increased nitric oxide production and 
a more vasodilators state.[49] G‑glutamylcysteines are 
compounds discovered in garlic, and these may lower 
blood pressure as illustrated by their ability to prohibit 
angiotension‑converting enzyme in vitro.[50] In this study, 
we observed a significant reduction in triglycerides in the 
mixed group compared with control group. However, no 
significant changes were observed in the mixed group 
compared with the garlic and lemon juice groups. In our 
study, we observed a significant reduction in fibrinogen 
in the mixed group compared with other groups. In 
some studies, it has been reported that garlic causes a 
significant reduction in fibrinogen.[51,52] Contrarily, a study 
published in 1998 concluded that garlic has no effects 
on fibrinogen.[53] Previous studies regarding the effect of 
garlic alone have focused on lipid levels. One important 
difference between our study and these other studies was 
the combination of garlic and lemon juice. Even though 
the subjects were instructed to consume only 20 g garlic 
and 1 tablespoon of lemon juice, some significant effects 
were seen for the mentioned variables. In the present 
study, we provided garlic and lemon juice for participants 
and did not recommend a specific diet. This limitation 
should be considered in interpreting the findings of this 
research. We analyzed patient food records. The present 
study has some other potential limitations; it cannot 
suggest appropriate doses of garlic and lemon juice for 
people with hyperlipidemia. To establish this, other 
studies examining the effects of different doses of garlic 
and lemon juice are required.
CONCLUSIONS
In conclusion, a combination of garlic and lemon juice 
resulted in an improvement in lipid levels and blood 
pressure of people with hyperlipidemia. Further studies 
to determine the appropriate doses of garlic and lemon 
juice for these patients are warranted. In addition, the 
effect of a combination of garlic and lemon juice might

be different based on the degree of hyperlipidemia. 
Therefore, studies are needed to examine the effects 
of garlic plus lemon juice according to the degree of 
hyperlipidemia.
