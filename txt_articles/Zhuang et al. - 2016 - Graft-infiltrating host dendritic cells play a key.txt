Successful engraftment of organ transplants has traditionally relied on preventing the
activation of recipient (host) Tcells. Once T-cell activation has occurred, however, stalling the
rejection process becomes increasingly difficult, leading to graft failure. Here we demonstrate
that graft-infiltrating, recipient (host) dendritic cells (DCs) play a key role in driving the
rejection of transplanted organs by activated (effector) Tcells. We show that donor DCs that
accompany heart or kidney grafts are rapidly replaced by recipient DCs. The DCs originate
from non-classical monocytes and form stable, cognate interactions with effector T cells in
the graft. Eliminating recipient DCs reduces the proliferation and survival of graft-infiltrating
T cells and abrogates ongoing rejection or rejection mediated by transferred effector T cells.
Therefore, host DCs that infiltrate transplanted organs sustain the alloimmune response after
T-cell activation has already occurred. Targeting these cells provides a means for preventing
or treating rejection.

 I
mprovement in organ allograft survival over the past 30 years
can be attributed to the development of potent inhibitors of
T-cell activation and proliferation. Despite these advances, a
substantial proportion of transplanted organs are still rejected1.
Rejection
results
from
incomplete
inhibition
of
recipient
T cells that recognize donor alloantigens, leading to the
generation of effector and memory T cells2. Since effector and
memory T cells are more difficult to suppress or eliminate than
naive T cells3–6, rejection becomes increasingly difficult to treat
or prevent once T-cell priming has occurred. This is borne out by
clinical data showing that patients with pre-existing anti-donor
memory T cells or those who experience acute rejection
are at significantly increased risk of graft loss7–9. Therefore,
understanding the factors that sustain the alloimmune response
beyond initial T-cell activation is necessary for developing more
effective anti-rejection therapies.
A key cell that participates in T-cell activation is the dendritic
cell (DC). DCs activate T cells by presenting antigenic peptides in
the context of MHC molecules to the T-cell receptor (TCR),
and by providing co-stimulatory signals required for T-cell
proliferation and differentiation10. In organ transplantation,
donor DCs that accompany the graft migrate to the recipient’s
secondary
lymphoid
tissues11–13.
There
they
initiate
the
alloimmune response by presumably engaging host alloreactive
T cells or by transferring donor alloantigens to recipient (host)
DCs14–16. In the latter case, alloantigens (for example, non-self
MHC molecules) are transferred intact (semi-direct antigen
presentation or cross-dressing) or are taken up and presented to
recipient T cells as non-self peptides bound to self-MHC
molecules (indirect antigen presentation or cross-priming)17,18.
Although
transplanted
organs
are
eventually
depleted
of
donor DCs, they are amply reconstituted with recipient DCs
after transplantation19–22. What role the latter cell population
plays is unclear. One possibility is that recipient DCs enhance
alloimmunity by capturing donor antigens in the graft and
activating additional T cells in secondary lymphoid tissues22.
Another significant possibility is that they exert their function
locally by engaging effector T cells within the graft.
In this study, we tested the hypothesis that recipient DCs play a
key role in rejection by forming cognate interactions with
effector T cells in the graft and sustaining T-cell responses
beyond initial T-cell activation in secondary lymphoid tissues.
We utilized flow cytometry, immunohistology and intravital
microscopy to investigate donor DC replacement by host DCs in
mouse heart and kidney grafts; to determine the phenotype,
function and origin of the host DCs; and to study their
interactions with effector T cells in the graft. We then performed
in vivo DC depletion experiments to establish their role in
allograft rejection.
Results
Replacement of donor DCs by host DCs in heart grafts. Donor-
derived DCs exit organ allografts after transplantation and are
replaced by recipient DCs. This observation is based on classical
histological studies that are limited in their phenotypic and
functional characterization of DCs19–21. We therefore analysed
myeloid cell populations in mouse heart grafts by flow cytometry
and conducted functional studies on isolated graft DCs. DCs
were identified as LinnegLy6GnegCD11c þMHC-IIþ leukocytes,
and recipient and donor DCs were distinguished by CD45.1
and CD45.2 expression, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 1). We
observed that recipient DCs populate both syngeneic and
allogeneic grafts, while donor-derived DCs dissipate quickly after
transplantation (Fig. 1a). Recipient DCs represented 485% of DCs
in the grafts on day 1 and 495% by day 7 (Fig. 1a). Comparable
magnitude and kinetics of DC replacement were observed in
fully allogeneic and semi-allogeneic (BALB/c � B6)F1 (F1) grafts,
but recipient DC number was significantly less in syngeneic
grafts or in allografts transplanted to mice treated with the T-cell
immunosuppressant cyclosporine A (Fig. 1a). Increase in recipient
DCs over time did not
result from in situ proliferation
because CD11c þ cells in the allografts were Ki67neg (Fig. 1b).
Thus, donor DCs in heart grafts are rapidly replaced by recipient
DCs. Moreover, an ongoing anti-donor alloimmune response
significantly increases recipient DC accumulation.
To validate the phenotype and function of recipient DCs, we
compared CD11c þ and CD11cneg myeloid cell populations in the
graft. We found that the majority of CD45.1 þLinnegLy6Gneg
recipient cells are CD11b þ and contain both CD11c þ and
CD11cneg populations (Fig. 1c). Most CD11c þ cells were Ly6Clo
(Fig. 1c) and differed from the CD11cneg population by higher
expression of MHC-II and CD86, weaker staining with the
macrophage marker F4/80, and undetectable CCR2 expression
(Supplementary Fig. 2a)—a phenotype consistent with that of a
DC. Poor F4/80 staining of CD11c þ cells was confirmed by
immunohistology (Supplementary Fig. 2b). An alternative flow
analysis
strategy
in
which
CD45.1 þLinnegLy6GnegCD11c þ
MHC-II þ cells were gated first confirmed that B90% were
F4/80loCD11b þ,
likely
representing
monocyte-derived
DC
(mono-DC),
and
B10%
were
F4/80loCD11bneg,
likely
representing conventional DC (cDC; Supplementary Fig. 2c).
Unlike their CD11cneg counterparts, recipient-derived (CD45.1 þ
CD45.2neg) CD11c þ cells sorted from day 7 grafts triggered
proliferation of and IFN-g secretion by allogeneic naive CD4 and
CD8 T cells in a direct mixed leukocyte culture (MLC; Fig. 1c)
and, when cultured alone, produced significantly more IL-12p70
(Fig.
1d).
Sorted
recipient-derived
(CD45.1 þ
CD45.2neg)
CD11c þ cells also induced proliferation of 1H3.1 and 2C T cells
via indirect and semi-direct (cross-dressing) antigen presentation,
respectively (Fig. 1e). 1H3.1 cells are CD4 þ TCR-transgenic (tg)
cells specific for BALB/c IEa52–68 presented in context of B6 IAb
(ref. 23), while 2C cells are CD8 þ TCR-tg cells that recognize
intact BALB/c MHC-I molecule H-2Ld (ref. 24). Further
characterization of the CD11cneg population revealed that it
consists of Ly6ChiF4/80hiCCR2 þ
and Ly6CloF4/80loCCR2neg
subsets (Fig. 1c; Supplementary Fig. 2a), the former secreting
the highest level of TNFa (Supplementary Fig. 2d). Both CD11c þ
and CD11cneg cells were CD103neg and CD8aneg, but expressed
CD115 and CCR7 (Supplementary Fig. 2a). Therefore, the vast
majority of recipient CD11c þ cells that accumulate in heart
allografts
are
CD11b þCD8anegCD103neg
DCs
with potent
allostimulatory and Th1-polarizing functions, whereas CD11cneg
cells likely correspond to monocytes or macrophages with
inflammatory functions, but poor allostimulatory capabilities.
Host DCs in heart grafts stem from non-classical monocytes.
The data so far suggest that the majority of recipient DCs in the
graft derive from monocytes because they express CD11b and
CD115. To establish their origin and test whether they stem
from classical/inflammatory (CCR2 þCX3CR1loLy6Chi) or non-
classical/patrolling (CCR2negCX3CR1hiLy6Clo) monocytes, we
first investigated heart allografts transplanted to wild-type (WT)
and CCR2KO mice. In the latter, classical monocytes are retained
in the bone marrow due to absent CCR2 signalling25. As shown
by flow cytometry (Fig. 2a) and immunohistology (Fig. 2b), grafts
transplanted to CCR2KO or WT mice were equally populated
with recipient DCs despite significant reduction in intragraft and
circulating classical monocytes in CCR2KO recipients, indicating
that classical monocytes are not an important precursor of graft
DCs. Next we performed adoptive transfer experiments in which

revealed that the majority of CD45.1 þ DCs were CFSE þ
(Fig. 2c), implying that recipient DCs in the graft stem
predominantly from non-classical monocytes.
Replacement of donor DCs by host DCs in kidney grafts. We
next examined whether replacement of donor DCs by recipient
mono-DCs also occurs in kidney grafts, which harbour a more
extensive network of DCs than heart grafts26. We transplanted
kidney allografts from CD45.2 F1 CD11c-YFP (yellow fluorescent
protein) mice to CD45.1 B6 CX3CR1gfp/ þ recipients in which
one locus of the fractalkine receptor has been replaced with the
GFP gene27. In these recipients, mono-DCs express high levels of
green
fluorescent
protein
(GFP).
Grafts
were
imaged
by
multiphoton
intravital
microscopy
and
collected
for
flow
analysis at end of imaging. As shown by microscopy (Fig. 3a),
and confirmed by flow analysis (Fig. 3b), donor DCs (YFP þ)
were replaced by a greater number of recipient mono-DCs
(GFP þ) by day 7 after transplantation. The monocyte origin of
recipient DCs was established by imaging kidney allografts
transplanted to CD11c-YFP x CX3CR1gfp/ þ mice in which
mono-DCs are double-colored (YFP þGFP þ) while cDCs are
single-colored (YFP þ). As shown in Fig. 3c, majority of DCs
present on day 7 were double-coloured (depicted in red), strongly
suggesting
that
they
belong
to
the
monocyte
lineage.
Single-coloured YFP þ
cells were a minority while single-
coloured GFP þ cells were rare and did not have dendritic
cell
morphology.
Flow
cytometry
confirmed
conspicuous
predominance of mono-DCs over cDCs in kidney allografts
(Fig. 3c).
Host DCs in the graft form cognate contacts with T cells. The
large number of recipient DCs in the graft and their potent
allostimulatory capacity suggest that they could participate in the
local effector immune response. This hypothesis is supported by
our observation that DCs capture antigen-specific effector T cells
inside graft capillaries and mediate their trans-endothelial
migration28. To test whether recipient DCs continue to form
cognate
interactions
with
effector
T
cells
in
the
graft’s
interstitium, we transplanted F1 Act-OVA kidneys to chimeric
B6 mice that harbour equal numbers of H2-Kb � / � (YFP þ) and
H2-Kb þ / þ (GFP þ) DCs. OT-I effector T cells were transferred
1
week
after
transplantation
and
multiphoton
intravital
microscopy of the transplanted kidney performed 1 day later.
Since the OVA peptide recognized by OT-I cells is presented by
H-2Kb, cognate T-cell–DC interactions could be discerned by
quantifying OT-I contacts with H2-Kb þ / þ and H2-Kb � / � DCs
in the same graft. OT-I effectors were readily visible in the renal
cortex one day after transfer (Fig. 4a, Supplementary Movie 1),
490% had transmigrated into the interstitium (Fig. 4b), and
480% were contacting (42 min duration) H2-Kb þ / þ
or
H2-Kb � / � DCs (Fig. 4c, Supplementary Movie 2). However, a
greater proportion of OT-I effectors contacted H2-Kb þ / þ than
H2-Kb � / � DCs (Fig. 4d), and the mean contact time with
H2-Kb þ / þ DCs was significantly longer (18 versus 6 min,
respectively; Fig. 4e). The increased contact time correlated with
lower mean velocity and higher arrest coefficient for OT-I
effectors contacting H-2Kb þ / þ DCs (Fig. 4e). These results
indicate that cognate antigen recognition stabilizes effector
T-cell–DC interactions. To directly test the role of recipient
DCs in arresting effector T cells in the graft, we transplanted F1

significantly increased the velocity and decreased the arrest
coefficient of effector T cells in the graft. Therefore, recipient
DCs engage infiltrating effector T cells in a cognate fashion,
leading to their stable arrest.
Host DCs promote effector T-cell-mediated rejection. To test
the functional significance of effector T-cell–DC interactions in
the graft, we investigated the effect of recipient DC depletion on
heart allograft survival in two experimental models. In the first
model, we initiated DC depletion 5 days after transplantation, at
which time effector T cells generated in secondary lymphoid
tissues had already infiltrated the graft. In the second model, we
performed DC depletion in splenectomized LTbRKO recipients,
which lack all secondary lymphoid tissues and cannot mount a
primary alloimmune response15,29, and studied graft rejection
after transferring effector/memory (CD44hi) T cells primed
against donor antigens.
As shown in Fig. 5a, delayed depletion of DCs in B6
CD11c-DTR-B6 bone marrow chimeras by repeated DT
administration starting on day 5 after transplantation and
continued every other day until graft rejection, significantly
prolonged allograft survival compared with control B6-B6
chimeras that received the same DT regimen or to control B6
CD11c-DTR-B6 bone marrow chimeras injected with PBS
instead of DT (MST ¼ 30 versus 10 days in both cases). Analysis
of the grafts on day 7 confirmed DC depletion in the CD11c-DTR
group (Fig. 5b), and showed decreased number, decreased
proliferation, and increased apoptosis of infiltrating CD4 and
CD8 T cells (Fig. 5c). Reduced in situ T-cell proliferation after DC
depletion was confirmed by immunostaining graft tissue for Ki67
and the mitotic marker Histone 3 pS10 (Fig. 5d). In contrast to
these results, allografts transplanted to B6 CCR2KO mice, in
which CD11b þCD11cneg cells, but not CD11b þCD11c þ cells
(which represent mono-DCs) are reduced in the graft (Fig. 2a),
were promptly rejected with normal proliferation of infiltrating
T cells (Supplementary Fig. 3). These findings imply that
recipient DCs play an important role in rejection by promoting
the proliferation and survival of effector T cells within the graft.
Next we transplanted BALB/c hearts to splenectomized B6
CD11c-DTR-B6 LTbRKO bone marrow chimeras and trans-
ferred effector/memory CD4 þ and CD8 þ T cells from BALB/c-
sensitized B6 mice 2 days later. Recipients were left untreated or
were injected with DT beginning on day of transplantation or 10
days later, and every other day thereafter until graft rejection.

Delaying DT administration until day 10 after transplantation
prolonged allograft survival in CD11c-DTR chimeras by B14
days (MST ¼ 44 days), but did not reach statistical significance.
Immunohistology demonstrated that grafts collected from the
DT-treated group lacked CD11c þ cells and had a significant
reduction in CD4 þ and CD8 þ T-cell infiltrates (Fig. 6b).

 To ensure that differences in graft outcomes between DT-treated
and untreated mice were not due to a difference in engraftment
of transferred T cells, we tested the effect of repeated DT
administration on the number and function of effector T cells
transferred to splenectomized CD11c-DTR-LTbRKO chimeras.
As shown in Supplementary Fig. 4, 21 days after transfer CD44hi
T cells were readily detected in the bone marrow and blood
despite continuous DC depletion, and neither their number nor
capacity
to
produce
IFN-g
were
reduced
compared
with
untreated mice. Altogether, the findings indicate that recipient
DCs that infiltrate the graft play a key role in rejection.
Discussion
The results reported in this study provide novel insights into the
nature, origin and function of host DCs that infiltrate organ
transplants. First, we established that the majority of recipient
DCs that replace donor DCs in heart and kidney grafts are
non-conventional CD11b þCD11c þ DCs that produce IL-12,
originate from non-classical monocytes, and are phenotypically
and functionally distinct from other monocyte-derived cells in the
graft. These findings are consistent with reports showing that
non-classical monocytes are the principal source of CD11c þ cells
at sites of sterile inflammation (for example, in atherosclerotic
plaques)30,31, but differ from studies in infection models where
the majority of DCs have an inflammatory, TNFa-producing
phenotype and arise from classical monocytes32–34. These
differences are likely due to distinct stimuli that drive monocyte
differentiation in separate inflammatory settings. It is also
possible that transplantation presents a unique situation in
which allogeneic non-self, working in concert with or in addition
to inflammation, triggers monocyte differentiation to DCs.
We have recently shown that IL-12 producing DCs with
monocyte lineage markers accumulate and persist over time in
allogeneic but not syngeneic grafts transplanted to mice that lack
adaptive immune cells35.
Second, we demonstrated that graft-infiltrating, host DCs
preferentially induce T-cell differentiation to a Th1 phenotype,
which is the dominant T-cell phenotype in rejection. Antigen
presentation by host DCs was not restricted to cross-priming
indirectly alloreactive T cells, but was also effective at priming
directly alloreactive T cells. Activation of the latter by host DCs
is possible if DCs were ‘cross-dressed’ with intact donor
MHC molecules in the graft. Although not formally shown
here, cross-dressing has been described in vitro and in vivo and
likely participates in immune responses to viruses, bone marrow
transplants and organ transplants17,36–39. Therefore, host DCs
that replace donor DCs in the graft are not limited to engaging
indirectly alloreactive T cells, which represent a minute fraction
of the host’s alloreactive T-cell repertoire, but can also present
non-self MHC molecules to the much larger population of
directly alloreactive T cells.
Third, we provided direct visual evidence that host DCs engage
effector T cells in the graft. Most effector T cells that had
transmigrated into the graft made stable contacts with DCs.
The contacts were more numerous and stable with DCs that

 presented cognate antigen than those that did not. Our
observation that OT-I effectors continue to make interactions
with H-2Kb � / � DCs (Fig. 4), some of which are very stable,
could suggest that cross-dressing of these DCs with H-2Kb
molecules
carrying
the
OVA
peptide
has
taken
place.
Alternatively, these interactions, especially the shorter duration
ones, could be mediated by chemokines. Altogether, these
observations extend our previous findings that DCs capture
anti-donor effector T cells within capillaries and promote their
trans-endothelial migration28. Therefore, graft-infiltrating, host
DCs continue to engage effector T cells even after the latter have
transmigrated into the graft parenchyma.
Finally,
we
demonstrated
the
functional
significance
of
interactions between graft DCs and effector T cells by depleting
DCs in heart transplant recipients. We showed that host DC
depletion reduces arrest, proliferation, and survival of effector
T cells in situ. In graft survival experiments, host DC depletion
interrupted ongoing rejection in WT recipients and prevented
rejection exclusively mediated by effector T cells in mice that
lacked secondary lymphoid tissues. These data strongly point to
the graft as the site of productive host DC-effector T-cell
interactions that drive rejection.
An additional mechanism by which graft-infiltrating, host DCs
could promote rejection is through migration to secondary
lymphoid tissues where they prime more T cells. Celli et al.22
showed that host DCs that infiltrate skin allografts home to
draining lymph nodes and cross-prime CD8 þ T cells on re-
transplanting the graft to a second recipient. Since in this scenario
retransplantation was a powerful trigger for DC exit from the graft,
it remains to be determined whether graft-infiltrating, recipient
DCs migrate to secondary lymphoid tissues from an organ that
had been transplanted only once. It is also possible that recipient

 DCs recall alloreactive memory T cells in the graft. Memory
T cells comprise a substantial fraction of the alloreactive T-cell
repertoire40, utilize the same mechanisms as effector T cells to
access the graft28, and cause rejection without the need for prior
activation in secondary lymphoid tissues41. In infection models,
DCs at non-lymphoid sites recall memory T cells42, raising the
likelihood that comparable events occur in organ transplants.
Therefore, host DCs that populate transplanted organs could
sustain the alloimmune response via multiple pathways.
The role of DCs in priming the immune response to
transplanted organs is well-recognized14,43. This initial step
occurs when naive T cells encounter alloantigen-bearing DCs in
secondary lymphoid tissues15. Here we extended this fundamental
paradigm by showing that DCs are also key to sustaining the
alloimmune
response
outside
secondary
lymphoid
tissues.
This second step occurs when effector T cells encounter host
DCs in the graft itself. The clinical implication is that rejection in
patients who are already primed against donor alloantigens
can be interrupted or prevented by targeting host DCs or their
precursors,
the
monocytes.
These
patients
are
high-risk
transplant recipients whose grafts fare poorly despite current
immunosuppression.

Surgical procedures and bone marrow chimeras. Splenectomies and heterotopic
transplantation of vascularized heart and kidney grafts were performed as
follows15,44,45: Splenectomy—a 1–1.5 cm left flank incision midway between the
last rib and the hip bone was made, followed by a peritoneal incision. Splenic vein
and artery were tied off at the hilum and the spleen was removed. Animals
recovered for at least 7 days before further experimental use. Heart
transplantation—after a midline incision and sternotomy, the donor heart was
perfused with 2 ml of 4 �C heparinized (100 U ml � 1) PBS via the inferior vena
cava. The left superior vena cava and pulmonary veins were ligated near the atrium
and divided distally to the ligatures. The ascending aorta and a segment of the
innominate artery were mobilized. The aorta was cut close to the innominate artery
before the bifurcation. The pulmonary artery was mobilized and transected at the
point of bifurcation. The heart was collected and stored in 4 �C normal saline in
sterile conditions. After a midline incision, the recipient’s abdominal aorta and
inferior vena cava were mobilized for a short segment from bifurcations of renal
vessels to bifurcations of common iliac vessels. Lumbar veins behind the inferior
vena cava were cauterized. The aorta and the pulmonary artery of the donor heart
were anastomosed end-to-side to the recipient’s abdominal aorta and vena cava.
After reperfusion of the donor heart, the gut was replaced and allowed to resume its
normal position around the grafted heart. Kidney transplantation—the donor
kidney, renal artery, renal vein and B1 cm segment of the abdominal aorta and
inferior vena cava were recovered en bloc, perfused with ice-cold PBS containing
1% heparin and immersed in University of Wisconsin solution (Duramed
Pharmaceuticals, Cincinnati, OH, USA) at 4 �C for 15 min until transplantation.
The recipient was anaesthetized with 10 mg kg � 1 Xylazine and 100 mg kg � 1
Ketamine (Henry Schein, Melville, NY, USA) and end-to-side anastomosis of the
aorta and vena cava of the donor to those of the recipient, respectively, was
performed. Warm ischaemia time averaged 25 min. Heart graft rejection was
defined as cessation of palpable heartbeat and was confirmed by histological
analysis. Bone marrow chimeras were generated by irradiating recipient mice with
1,100 cGy in two doses 6 h apart from a Nordion Gamma Cell 40 caesium
source. After irradiation the mice were injected intravenously (i.v.) with 1 � 107
donor bone marrow cells and given Sulfatrim in the drinking water for
1 week. After an 8-week reconstitution period, blood was phenotyped to
verify appropriate reconstitution. Chimerism was consistently o90–95% in the
blood.
Isolation of graft-infiltrating leukocytes. Mice were anaesthetized and perfused
with 20–40 ml PBS þ 0.5% heparin via the left ventricle until the fluid exiting the
right ventricle did not contain any visible blood. Transplanted organs were then
removed, cut into small fragments or homogenized using a GentleMACS tissue
processor (Miltenyi), and incubated with 400 U ml � 1 type IV collagenase for 1 h at
37 �C, pipetting the fragments every 15 min. Single-cell suspensions were
then obtained by passing the fragments through a 70 mm cell strainer,
depleted of erythrocytes with NH4Cl lysis buffer, rinsed in cold 0.010 M EDTA
PBS and centrifuged on top of a Lympholyte-M (Cedarlane) density gradient
(1,500g, 20 min, room temperature). Total recovered cells were counted using a
hemocytometer or an automated cell counter (Beckman Coulter).
Flow cytometric analysis. Isolated cells were incubated with CD16/CD32
(2.4G2, 1:100) Ab to block FcR, and then labelled (30 min, 4 �C) with different
combinations of fluorochrome-conjugated Abs specific for MHC class-I (AF6-88.5,
1:200) or II (AF6-120.1, 1:200) (H2b), CD3 (145-2C11, 1:100), CD4 (RM4-5,
1:100), CD8a (53-6.7, 1:100), CD11c (HL3, 1:100), CD11b (M1/70, 1:200), CD19
(1D3, 1:100), CD45.1 (A20, 1:100), CD45.2 (104, 1:100), CD86 (GL1, 1:50), CD103
(M290, 1:100), CD115 (AFS98, 1:100), CCR2 (SA203G11, 1:100), CCR7 (4B12,
1:100), Ly6C (HK1.4, 1:800), Ly6G (1A8, 1:100), F4/80 (BM8, 1:200) or NK1.1
(PK136, 1:100), for flow analysis or cell sorting. Appropriate fluorochrome-
conjugated isotype-matched Abs were used as negative controls. After staining,
cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, acquired on a LSRII or LSR Fortessa flow
cytometer (BD Biosciences) and analysed using FACSDiva (BD Biosciences),
WinMDI 2.9 or FlowJo V9 software.
Annexin-V binding and BrdU incorporation were performed according to
manufacturer’s instructions (BD Biosciences). BrdU was injected i.p. 12 h before
euthanasia. For detection of intracellular IFN-g, cells were cultured for 5 h at
250,000 cells per well, in 96-well round bottom plates with brefeldin A
(10 mg ml � 1), PMA (20 ng ml � 1) and ionomycin (100 mM). After culture, cells
were surface labelled with fluorochrome-conjugated CD4 and CD8 Abs,
permeabilized with Cytofix/Cytoperm solution (eBiosciences) and labelled with
PE-conjugated IFN-g Ab (1:100).
OT-I effector T cells. CD8 OT-I Teff were generated in vivo similar to method
previously described46. Briefly, B6 (CD45.1) mice were injected with 25 mg
anti-DEC205-OVA hybrid antibody i.v. and 50 mg anti-CD40 Ab (FGK4.5) i.p.
after adoptive transfer of 105 OT-I RagKO (CD45.2) splenocytes. Six days later,
OT-I Teff (CD45.2 þ CD8 þ) were high-speed sorted using a BD FACS ARIA þ
(BD Biosciences) cell sorter using the following exclusion channel: CD45.1 þ
CD4 þ CD11b þ CD11c þ F4/80 þ CD45R/B220 þ(RA3-6B2, 1:200) Ly-76 þ
(Ter-119, 1:200) CD16/32 þ CD49b þ(DX5, 1:200). Purity was 495%. OT-I Teff
were labelled with 2 mM Cell Tracker Red (20 min, 37 �C). 107 OT-I T cells were
transferred i.v. into kidney graft recipients before imaging.
Immunostaining and microscopic analysis of graft tissue. Graft tissue was
snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at � 80 �C until use. OCT embedded
frozen tissues were sectioned by cryostat (10 mm). Tissue sections were fixed in 95%
ethanol, and treated with 5% normal goat serum followed by the avidin/biotin
blocking kit (Vector). Grafts were stained with (i) CD11c Ab (hamster, 1:100) and
Ki67 (SP6) Ab (rabbit, 1:100) plus Cy3-anti-hamster IgG (1:400) and Cy2
anti-rabbit IgG (1:400); (ii) CD11c Ab (hamster, 1:100) and biotin-IAb (1:100),
followed by Cy3-anti-hamster IgG (1:400) plus Cy2-streptavidin (1:400); (iii)
CD11c Ab (hamster, 1:100) and biotin-CD45.1 (1:100), followed by Cy3-anti-
hamster IgG (1:400) plus Cy2-streptavidin (1:400); (iv) AF488-CD4 Ab (1:50),
biotin-CD8 (1:100), and Ki67 Ab (rabbit, 1:100), plus AF647-streptavidin (1:400)
and Cy3-anti-rabbit IgG (1:400); or (v) biotin-CD4 Ab (1:100) or biotin-CD8 Ab
(1:100) and anti-phospho-histone H3 (Ser10) Ab (rabbit polyclonal, 1:500), fol-
lowed by AF647-streptavidin (1:400) and Cy3-anti-rabbit IgG (1:400). Nuclei were
stained with DAPI (Invitrogen). Slides were examined with a Nikon Eclipse E800
microscope equipped with a CCD camera (Nikon, Melville, NY, USA). Percentages
of CD4 and CD8 T cells expressing Ki67 and phospho-histone H3 (Ser10) were
quantified on digital images taken at � 200, on five sections per allograft, with the
MetaMorph Version 7.7 software.
Multiphoton intravital microscopy. Multiphoton intravital microscopy was
performed on transplanted kidneys. After a midline incision, the transplanted
kindey was carefully mobilized into a plastic cup-shaped holder attached to a x–y–z
manipulator on the imaging platform. The kidney was embedded in 2%
low-melting point 37 �C agarose and covered with a coverslip45. An Olympus
FluoView FV1000 microscope equipped with a MaiTai DeepSee femtosecond-
pulsed laser (Spectra-Physics) or a A1R MP Nikon Multiphoton system with a
Chameleon IR Laser, a Prior ProScan III stage and a MCL Nano-Drive objective
Z-drive. Lasers were tuned and mode-locked to 920 nm (GFP, YFP) or 850 nm
(CellTrackerRed plus fluorescent protein excitation). Both microscopes are
equipped with 4 non-descanned photomultiplier tubes with the following filter sets:
Ch1 (480/40), Ch2 (540/40), Ch3 (610/80) and Ch4 (705/90). Microscope data
were acquired with Olympus Fluoview v3.1 or Nikon NIS-Elements v4.3. Mice
were anaesthetized with isoflurane and oxygen and core body temperature
maintained at 37 �C with a homeothermic controller (TC-1000, CWE, Ardmore,
PA). Animals were kept hydrated by injecting 1 ml 5% dextrose lactated ringer’s
solution s.c. every 60 min. Blood vessels were visualized by injecting Evans Blue
(3–6 ml of 5 mg ml � 1 stock solution (15–30 mg) diluted in PBS i.v.). The kidney
graft was extraverted from the abdominal cavity with intact vascular connection
and immobilized in a custom cup mount. A coverslip was placed on top of the
kidney and z stacks were visualized with a � 25 water immersion objective
(numerical aperture: 1.05) 25 mm to 50 mm below the kidney capsule. A total of 11
slices per stack were acquired at a step size of 2.5 mm. Brightness and laser power
were adjusted based on the imaging depth and kept below phototoxic levels. Dwell
time was set to 8 ms per pixel (Olympus) or � 16 averaging (Nikon resonance
scanner) at a resolution of 512 � 512 pixel. Approximately 30-s-long stacks were
repeatedly scanned for a maximum imaging time of B30 min per location. Up to
five different locations per kidney graft were imaged. All acquired movies were
analysed using Imaris software (Bitplane). Drift was corrected using the blood
vessels as a reference point. Background subtraction was performed on all channels
equally. All cells expressing GFP, YFP or both were enumerated manually. In the
CX3CR1-GFP x CD11c-YFP mouse, the MATLAB channel arithmetics plugin was
used to compensate for spillover of GFP (ch1) into the YFP channel (ch2) and
create GFP only, YFP only and GFP/YFP co-expression channels. Three-
dimensional (3D) surfaces of OT-I T cells were generated and the number of tracks
present for 42 min was used to enumerate the number of T cells. Cells were
determined to be extravascular if the majority or all of the cell body had moved
outside the capillary lumen.
Ex vivo assay of antigen presentation. Leukocytes from four B6 (CD45.1) mice
transplanted 7 days before with BALB/c (CD45.2) hearts were pooled and labelled
with fluorochrome-conjugated CD3, CD19, NK1.1, CD11b, CD11c, CD45.1,
CD45.2, Ly6C and Ly6G Abs (all at 1:100). The Linneg (that is, CD3, CD19, NK1.1)
Ly6Gneg CD45.2neg CD45.1 þ recipient-derived leukocytes were sorted with a
FACSAria flow cytometer (BD-Biosciences) into CD11c þ Ly6Clo, CD11cneg
Ly6Clo and CD11cneg Ly6Chi subsets (all CD11b þ). Sorted cells were then
g-irradiated and used as stimulators of CFSE (7.5 mM)-labelled BALB/c, 1H3.1, 2C
or B6 (control) splenic naive T cells (T-cell enrichment columns, R&D Systems) in
96-well round-bottom plates (25,000 APCs: 200,000 T cells per well). After 5 days,
T cells were labelled with fluorochrome-conjugated CD4 and CD8 Abs (both at
1:100), and CFSE-dilution determined by flow analysis.

 ELISA. Detection of IFN-g, TNF-a and IL-12p70 in cell culture supernatants was
done following manufacturer’s instructions (BD-PharMingen, R&D).
Adoptive transfer of monocytes. Ly6Chi and Ly6Clo monocytes (both CD11b þ
CD11cneg) were FACS-sorted from bone marrow of B6 (CD45.1) mice. The Ly6Chi
cells were left unlabelled and the Ly6Clo monocytes were CFSE (7.5 mM)-labelled.
Both monocyte subpopulations were co-transferred i.v. at 1:1 ratio to B6 (CD45.2)
hosts (250,000 of each subset per mouse) that were transplanted 5 days earlier with
BALB/c (CD45.2) hearts. Two days later (day 7) recipients were killed and heart
allografts and spleens were disaggregated, cells labelled with fluorochrome-
conjugated Abs specific for CD11b, CD11c, CD45.1, CD45.2, IAb and Ly6C
(all at 1:100), and analysed by flow cytometry.
Assessment of T-cell engraftment. Effector/memory (CD44hi) T cells (B6,
CD45.1) primed against BALB/c antigens were high-speed sorted, transferred i.v. to
splenectomized CD11c-DTR-B6 bone marrow-LTbRKO-B6 chimeras (CD45.2),
and assessed by flow cytometry in peripheral blood and bone marrow 21 days later
in mice injected i.p., or not, with DT (4 ng g � 1 body weight) every 2 days, starting
1 day before T-cell injection. On day 21, mice were killed and the number of bone
marrow cells and peripheral blood leukocytes were counted using a hemocytometer
or an automated cell counter, respectively. RBCs were lysed with NH4Cl solution.
Blood and bone marrow cells were labelled with CD3 (1:100), CD44 (IM7, 1:250),
CD45 (30-F11, 1:100) and CD45.1 Abs and analysed by flow cytometry. For
detection of eGFP þ DCs, bone marrow cells were labelled with CD11c and MHC-
II (IAb) Abs, and analysed by flow cytometry. For ex vivo detection of intracellular
IFN-g in the adoptively transferred effector/memory (CD44hi) T cells, bone
marrow cells were incubated with donor (BALB/c) or syngeneic (B6) splenocytes
(1:1 cell ratio, 96-well plates) in complete medium with 1 ml ml � 1 of Golgiplug
(BD). After 16 h, cells were labelled with CD3, CD44 and CD45.1 Abs, fixed with
4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.1% saponin in PBS, labelled with
IFN-g Ab and analysed by flow cytometry.
Statistical analysis. GraphPad Prism was used for statistical analyses. Results are
expressed as mean±s.d. of biological replicates unless otherwise specified.
Comparison between two groups was performed by two-sided Student’s t-test for
unpaired samples. Multiple comparisons on a single data set were done by one-way
analysis of variance, followed by Tukey–Kramer multiple comparison test. Graft
survival was compared by Kaplan–Meier analysis and the log-rank test. P value
o0.05 was considered significant. Sample sizes (biological replicates¼ mice in each
group) were determined based on extensive published data in mouse transplantation
showing statistical significance in similar group sizes with normal variation and
similar variance between groups. Heart grafts not beating 48h after transplantation
were deemed technical failures and were excluded from analysis. This occurred in
B5% of cases. Kidney grafts showing poor blood perfusion at time of imaging were
excluded. This occurred in B20% of cases. No randomization was used as all mice
were used were genetically defined, inbred mice. Flow and image analysis were
blinded and performed by multiple independent investigators (MHO, ADH and
RH). Histopathological analysis was blinded and performed by AEM.
