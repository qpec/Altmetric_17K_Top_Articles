EDITORIAL REVIEW
Patients misrepresenting their risk
factors for AIDS
Stuart Brody PhD
Department of Medical Psychology, University of Tidnngen, Tiibingen, Germany
Summary: To determine the truthfulness of patients' and research subjects' self-
reports of their sexual and drug use histories in studies of human immunodeficiency
virus (HIV) transmission and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) risk
factors, studies of or pertinent to lying about AIDS risk factors were extracted from
MEDLINE and PSYCLIT. The present paper describes normal and pathological
motives for misrepresenting risk factors, and reviews the literature on such
underreporting. There is much evidence for lying about anal intercourse and
intravenous drug use risk factors, implying that the estimates of risk for vaginal
transmission of HIV (particularly in Pattern-I industrialized countries) have been
inflated. Research on HIV/AIDS behavioural risk factors must include sophisticated
methods for the assessment of self-report validity, such as the use of behavioural
markers, improved lie scales and interview methods, and physical methods.

INTRODUCTION
The primary basis for considering heterosexual
intercourse to be a significant source of human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections is the
logical exclusion process: patients acknowledge
heterosexual intercourse, but deny homosexual 01
recreational intravenous activity (and contaminated
transfusions). At first, such a deductive process
seems quite sound. But as one begins to consider
the garbled nature of the sexual practice categories
and the invalid reports of both fairly normal and
psychopathological patient groups, the reasoning
underlying this exclusion process disintegrates.
Anal intercourse (but not condom use or total
number of sexual partners) was associated with
seropositivity in women reporting no history of
intravenous (IV) drug use or transfusionI, Risk
of HIV transmission is directly related to degree of
rectal trauma during anal intercourse and related
foreplay-, At least 25% of women have engaged
in receptive anal intercourse', with at least 10%
of women doing so on an ongoing basis4.5.
Among consecutive gynaecologic patients, 25%
reported anal intercourse when asked", but 71%
admitted at least one such experience when queried
at a second or third interview". The likelihood
increases with lifetime number of partners",
The total number of these women may exceed

the number of men who have engaged in receptive
anal intercourse", However, the frequency of
heterosexual anal intercourse is probablllower than
that of homosexual anal intercourse1 . Similarly,
the prevalence of activities which dramatically
increase the risk of HIV spread during anal
intercourse, such as 'fisting'2 and volatile nitrite
use!' is probably lower in heterosexual than
homosexual groups-'.
Epidemiological tabulations of acquired immuno-
deficiency syndrome (AIDS) cases by risk factor 13
include male homosexual contact (which includes
but does not necessitate a history of receptive anal
intercourse), but do not consider any index of
receptive anal intercourse for women, leading to
higher reported rates of 'heterosexual transmission'
for women. Heterosexual transmission is usually
misinterpreted by
most
readers
as
vaginal
intercourse.
The embarrassed reactions of some research
subjects has even led some investigators to remove
questions about anal intercourse from studies of risk
factors-". Even when inquiries are made, the
replies are generally taken at face value. In some
investigations, the possibility of misrepresentation
is noted, but no attempt is made to adjust epidemio-
logical data accordingly. Papers on methodological
problems in behavioural AIDS research15,16 have
considered exacerbating problems such as poor
inquiry methods, memory impairment in AIDS
patients, and the limited recall capacity of 'normals'.
However, the basic issue of whether the patient or
subject is responding honestly about their sexual
and drug history is often given minimal attention.
392
 When it is addressed, it is noted as a source of error
variance, but the transmission assumptions remain
fixedl 7.
The present paper describes normal and patho-
logical motives for lying about AIDS risk factors
(includingsocialdesirabilityresponding, personality
disorder,
and legal and cultural influences),
summarizes the findings on lying about risk factors,
and offers some suggestions for dealing with the
problem.
SOCIAL DESIRABILITY RESPONDING
The tendency for both clinical and non-clinical
populations to respond to questions in a socially
desirablemanner (i.e. to deny such common frailties
as failure to wash one's hands before every meal
or to be on time for every appointment) has been
$tudied extensivelyl8,19 and found to be a common
Source of distortion or invalidity in self-report
measures of psychopathology and other aspects of
be.haviour.
Psychological tests
such as
the
Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory
<MMPI) adjust psychopathology scores upwards (or
recommend considering the results invalid) on the
basis of such 'Lie' scores. If we infer that receptive
anal intercourse and intravenous drug use are at
least as sociallyundesirable for some people as being
late for an appointment or ever thinking anything
nasty about anyone, this particular form of lying is
sufficiently prevalent in normal populations as to
m~re ~han account for the Europeans and Americans
claunmg heterosexual transmission-". In a recent
survey of sexual behaviour in the general French
POpulation, the highest rate of non-response to
9uestions (4.2%) was to those dealing with anal
Intercourse21•
It has
been suggested that the process of
counselling against certain risk behaviour may lead
to greater denial of these risk behaviours, without
real
behaviour change".
As the notion of
?eterosexual transmission is increasingly touted23,
It .b~comes more likely that HN infected subjects
~ill opt for choosing this less socially marginalized
?sk factor, creating the impression of an increase
m the incidence of heterosexual cases.
Related to social desirability, but not the subject
of mUch investigation,
is the awkwardness
exper,ienced by the interviewer in pursuing the issue
o~ lying in research subjects and patients. This
dISComfort is even manifested in the language used
to describe lying in research reports. Computerized
searches of MEDLINE and PSYCLIT using the
recO.mmended terms 'lying' and 'deception' (and
~dding 'social desirability') in conjunction with
J:!IV' or 'acquired immunodeficiency syndrome'
yIeld few relevant citations. Only when all variants
of euphemisms (low validity, measurement error,
u~eliability, disconcordance, recall error, denial,

ment, underreporting, non-disclosure, incorrect

bias, discrepancy, and so on) are applied can the
bulk of the literature be found. The anxiety about
using the word 'lying' apears to parallel the anxiety
of admitting anal intercourse or N drug use.
ornsa NORMAL SOCIAL MOTIVES
FOR LYING
Occasional lying is a common, perhaps even
normative behaviour. College students recorded an
average of 2 lies per day in one study24. It has been
argued that the ease of providing honest answers
is an indication of the lack of personal importance
of the subject to the informant, and that refusal and
prevarication are reasonable expectations",
Some distortions appear fairly ubiquitous in
studies of sexual behaviour. For example, women
report fewer heterosexual partners than do men25•
Seven per cent of adolescents who completed a
sexual behaviour questionnaire not connected to
AIDS admitted they had lied about their replies26•
Similarly, 7% of seronegative adults responded
randomly and 7% 'held back' on sexual behaviour
questionnaires, according to their report in a later
interview27• Of course, these percentages do not
include subjects who were more consistent in their
lying, but do provide an estimate of a base rate
for lying about sexual behaviour in the general
population.
Guilt, fear of censure, mistrust (particularly
common in
substance abusers),
risk
of not
accomplishing
an
important task,
and
the
association of aspects of the patient's history with
fatal consequences have all been asserted to be
related to lying during the anamnesis-". Some
patients might wish to maintain privacy at all costs,
and a sub-group thereof may prefer to say no than
to refuse to answer questions'", As the option of
not answering becomes less accessible, as in
comprehensive population studies of AIDS, the
likelihood of lying rather than refusing to participate
increases-", It may be supposed that some patients
might hope for better medical and social attention
if they are not seen as having engaged in socially
stigmatized behaviour. It may also be conjectured
that after having been given what many patients
interpret as a death sentence, there is little
motivation for some patients (particularly the less
sociallyconscious) to be helpful in providing honest
answers to research queries.
Given that partner reports of sexual behaviour in
a non-clinical sample vary with the emotional
conditions of the relationshlpv, one can only
speculate what the effect on reporting validity
would be when the relationship has led to HIV
infection, or if the relationships consisted of several
anonymous sexual partners per evening.
For cultural reasons, obtaining valid information
about anal intercourse in Africa is even more
difficult than in industrialized countries, and this
lack of candour potentiates other bases for risk
category errors, such as shared instruments in
 394
International Journal of SID & AIDS Volume 6 November/December 1995
medical settings and female genital mutilations",
The pain and difficulty produced by female genital
mutilation may be an additional motivation to
engage in anal intercourse'S. It is also important
to remember that in many parts of the world,
homosexual behaviour, heterosexual anal inter-
course, or IV drug use are illegal, making lying a
very rational act.
PSYCHOPATHOLOGICAL MOTIVES
FOR LYING
Antisocial personalities are often identified with
lying or 'conning'. However, other personality
disorders have a tendency to lie as well. Paranoid
personalities feel no need to be truthful with those
they perceive to be 'the enemy'32. Histrionic
personalities have a general disdain for facts and
believe that conveying emotion and receiving
attention is all that matters. Narcissistic personalities
do not feel a need to 'play by the rules' and are
exploitative, seeking interpersonal power (that
telling a lie can provide) at others' expense.
Borderline personalities may lie because of poor
impulse control and low frustration tolerance.
Coming from a background in which the truth is
unimportant is a risk factorfor lying, as is an elevated
need to maintain a sense of independence from
intrusive others33• Borderline personalities may lie,
have severe reality distortions, or engage in pseudo-
logica fantastica (with dramatic and often sexual
content) to increase self-esteem and control others34•
Independent of ethnicity, gender, and treatment
status, significantly more intravenous drug users
(IVDU) with (18%) than without (8%) antisocial
personality had HIV infection35• Similar results
were found in a study of homosexual men, in which
there was a significantly higher prevalence of
personality disorder in the seropositives (33%) than
in the seronegatives (15%)36. Antisocial personality
disorder among methadone maintenance inpatients
has been associated with injection equipment
sharing37.
Population estimates of lifetime personality
disorder are 10-13%, including 2-3% antisocial, 1%
paranoid, and 2-4% borderline's.
LYING ABOUT HOMOSEXUALITY
AND RECEPTIVE ANAL INTERCOURSE
Three-quarters of a group of 20 seropositive soldiers
told military physicians that they had acquired the
virus heterosexually, and 12 of those 15 later
admitted homosexual (presumably receptive anal
intercourse) or IVdrug activity to health department
personnel'", The validity of the report of the
remaining 3 remains
in
question,
for
social
desirability or other reasons already noted. In
addition, an increased stigma appears to pertain to
homosexual and drug use self-report.
In a cross-eultural study of homosexual men,
20.5-52.3% did not admit the homosexual source
of infection at sexually transmitted disease clinics40•
Lying was associated with sex role conservatism,
a general concealment of homosexuality, feeling
that their society had a negative view of homo-
sexuality, lower self-esteem, and not accepting their
homosexualitys'.
In a study of perforations and lodged foreign
bodies in
the rectum conducted before the
identification of AIDS, it was noted that even during
acute rectosigmoid perforation, some homosexual
men would deny rectal instrumentation to
emergency room surgeonsv,
Reliability(necessary but not sufficient for validity)
of reports of homosexual practices in subjects
without AIDS was only fair for re-test intervals
over 6 weeks, but tended to be better for more
educated subjects with fewer partners. Under-
reporting of sexual activity as a result of the
pressure of the AIDS epidemic was assumed by
the irwestigators-'.
In a sample of 102 seropositive homosexual men,
20 denied anal intercourse on
questionnaires
(admitting orogenital activity), but when confronted
in a face-to-face interview, 11 of the 20 reported
receptive anal activity'". The self-report of the
remaining 9 remains in question. Another study of
146 homosexual men found that written question-
naires elicited 24cases of active oral-anal'rimming',
23cases of unprotected anal-genital intercourse, and
one case of 'listing' that were not reported during
interview45• The authors of a review of male
homosexual transmission of HIV46 noted that
subjects had recall bias and a reluctance to report
homosexual practices, particularly anal-genital inter-
course. It has been noted that the motivation for
denial of anal-genital intercourse increased as it
became apparent to the homosexual community that
this is the major route of infection'". The reports of
oral-genital transmission may thus be a spurious
result of a gay version of the logical exclusion
process, in which fellatio, but not anal intercourse
is admitted.
LYING ABOUT DRUG USE
The percentage of research subjects and patients
who lie about not smoking cigarettes has been
estimated at 2.2_40%48,49, but techniques such as
carboxyhaemoglobin, thiocyanate, and nicotine
quantification have allowed for probable detection
of the liars. Probable liars were more like: to be
younger, less educated, and non-white . In a
longitudinal study of 12,069 young adults, 8% of
men and 12% of women both reported marijuana
use when interviewed in 1980 and denied lifetime
marijuana use when re-interviewed in 1984 (there
were other combinations of 'inconsistent reporting'
as well). Blacks and Hispanics were twice as likely
as whites to have this type of inconsistent reporting,
and women were 50% more likely than were men.
The racial differences remained after multivariate
control for education'".
 In the Drug Use Forecasting study,
21,991
arrestees were asked about their 3-day drug use,
and given urine tests (which can detect cocaine and
opiates for approximately 3 days). For cocaine, 35%
denying use had positive urine tests, or put another
way, 52% of positive results were in those denying
use. For opiates, 5% denying use had positive
results, or put the other way, 44% of positive results
were in those denying use (urine analysis involved
the EMIT technique, which was less accurate than
gas chromatography/mass spectrometry techniques
and least accurate for opiates)52. Of course, these
methods do not have the sensitivity to detect drug
use in the distant past relevant to serving as a
marker for historical HIV transmission.
In the National Household Survey on Drug
Abuse, 67 former drug treatment patients were
(double-blind) included among the other subjects.
For lifetime use, 96% reporting marijuana use at
admission to drug treatment admitted same at the
survey, 84% for cocaine, and 68% for heroin. The
liepattern follows the social desirability of the drugs,
as it does in other surveys'S.
SOcial desirability test scores have been found to
,?erelated inversely to self-reports of receptive anal
Intercourse and sharing drug injection equipment,
but not serostatus in a sample of predominantly
blac~ male IVDUs in Baltimore'". Intravenous drug
UseIS directly associated with antisocial personality
an.d 1~g54-56, so a high rate of deception regarding
this risk factor should be assumed.
The use of computer-based screening for HIV risk
facto.rs at blood donation yielded 12 more cases (of
admItted IVDU, men who have sex with men, or
h~Vi;tg possible symptoms of HIV infection) than
dId I;tterview in a sample of 2725
7.
LYIng about drug use and anal intercourse may
also interact, Number of partners and drug use were
assocIated with unreliable recall of anal sex and
with overall dishonesty of sexual self-ref0rt in a
seronegative sample of army personnel/ .
LYING ABOUT HIV STATUS
A growing body of literature documents lying about
the ultimate AIDS risk factor, a positive HIV test.

users 'inaccurately' reported their status as negative

In another study, of 38 subjects informed of their
seropositivity, 5 later denied being tested or
knowing their results, and an additional 6 reported
testing negative for HIV63.
IMPROVING VALIDITY
Detection of lying is very difficult in the absence of
impeaching evidence. While forensic techniques of
interviewing, stating a clinical inference to the
patient rather than asking28, and use of specific
behavioural measuresst may be of some use, an
awareness of the prevalence of lying may be of
greatest value to the investigator.
An example of a physical (non-interview) method
for improving validity is that employed to retro-
spectively document a 1968 AIDS case in St Louis.
The presence of anorectal pathology (obliterative
lymphangitis,
prominent haemorrhoids,
and
Kaposi's sarcoma) led the investigator to infer that
the patient may have engaged in receptive anal
intercourse65•
When Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) staff interviewed and reviewed the medical
records of patients claiming heterosexual trans-
mission in Broward and Palm Beach Counties,
Florida, they reclassified 30% of the patients into
IVDU, transfusion, or male homosexual risk groups.
The record review was more productive than
were the interviews. Although not a basis for
reclassification, anorectal pathologies were found in
31.3% of the remaining men, and 14.3% of the
women. The remainder group also had high rates
of crack cocaine use, prostitution, and sex with
IVDUs and seropositivesw. In a New York City
study of men who claimed heterosexual transmission,
further investigation led to the finding that 18%
were IVDUs and 37% had sex with men'". A
National Research Council summary of several small
studies found that 20 of 24 New York military
applicants denying intravenous or homosexual risk
factors
later admitted same, as did 11 of 12
applicants in Colorado, 30 of 33 active-duty military
personnel, 97 of 109 New York blood donors, and
153 of 186blood donors in Baltimore, Los Angeles,
and Atlanta68• Using a different approach,
investigative reporters found evidence of a homo-
sexual past in sodally prominent men who attributed
their HIV infections to heterosexual causes-'.
RECOMMENDATIONS
It is recommended that investigations into risk
factors for HIV transmission (and progression to
AIDS) begin to incorporate means of verifying the
reports of their subjects. There is a need for different
measures of
social
desirability responding in
 396

NovemberlDecember 1995
different populations, and for a sceptical frame of
reference, in which multiple methods are employed
to ascertain how veridical the history is. These
methods include behavioural markers, physical
methods, reverse record techniques, assessment of
personality disorder, and improved lie scales and
interview methods (including multiple interviews
and both human and written or computer posing
of carefully prepared and phrased questioriss").
The use of behavioural markers,
while not
providing certain contradiction of a self-report, at
least allows assignment of the informant to the
category of unacceptably low reliability. Optimally,
multiple markers would be used. One marker for
IVdrug use is permanent tattoos, which were found
in 50%of a sample of IVDUs(the same study found
that 31.4% of tattooed subjects were seropositive,
compared to 7.2% of those not tattooed; and that
tattooed IVDUs were likely to have borderline
personality disordersFO. Other markers might be a
history of imprisonment or multiple arrests, or
membership in gay oriented organizations. The
shortcoming of markers such as tattoos is that they
are at best a mild to moderate correlate ofIVactivity.
Despite such a shortcoming, demographic and
attitudinal markers have
been used in large
population studies to impute a history of male
homosexual
activi~ for respondents leaving the
critical item blank? ,72.
The reverse record technique'? may be used to
investigate readiness for lying. It involves first
checking who was arrested (or filed for bankruptcy,
or some other memorialized transgression) and then
asking the subject (embedded in other interview
questions) if they had such an experience.
At the very least, patients and research subjects
require lengthy and repeated inquiries in a
supportive, but persistent manner. In a recent
Ugandan study, 3 times the percentage of women
admitted multiple partners during an in-depth
interview as did during a short interview (significant
inconsistencies in self-report of age were also
noted73) . Unlike the use of physical methods,
repeated questioning does not have associated
ethical liabilities. Thus, the balance between truth
and excellence in research on the one hand, and
intrusiveness in the
lives of people already
struggling to survive must be considered.
The use of multimodal investigation techniques
is likely to produce higher rates of falsification in
claims of vaginal and oral intercourse vectors, but
is unlikely to approach 100%,because some people
are both superior liars and careful about leaving
other evidence. It may be expected that results will
be less salutary for women than for men, unless 4
factors are considered: the tendency for women to
give socially desirable responses (lie) more often
than men62,74, the need for female anal intercourse
to be labelled a risk category, the underdiagnosis of
antisocial personalitydisorder in women (presumably
because of the focus on aggressive criteria54
),
and the likelihood that a higher proportion of
women than men claiming heterosexual trans-
mission are IVDUs (who may be less willing to
co-operate with investigators than would non-IVDU
men with a history of sex with other men).
Research and experience has shown us that
people lie often, for many reasons, and that the
content of these lies includes risk factors for HIV
transmission. Such lying is one of the factors
contributing to an inflated (particularly in Pattern-I
countries) estimate of vaginal HIV transmission-".
Given this lack of lying-controlled evidence, the
logical exclusion process cannot stop at vaginal
intercourse any more often than it can at close
non-sexual contact, which the CDC has recently
identified as a vector in a few cases of HIV
transmission".
