Transient auditory nerve demyelination as a new
mechanism for hidden hearing loss
Guoqiang Wan1,2 & Gabriel Corfas1
Hidden hearing loss (HHL) is a recently described auditory neuropathy believed to contribute
to speech discrimination and intelligibility deficits in people with normal audiological tests.
Animals and humans with HHL have normal auditory thresholds but defective cochlear
neurotransmission, that is, reduced suprathreshold amplitude of the sound-evoked auditory
nerve compound action potential. Currently, the only cellular mechanism known for HHL is
loss of inner hair cell synapses (synaptopathy). Here we report that transient loss of cochlear
Schwann cells results in permanent auditory deficits characteristic of HHL. This auditory
neuropathy is not associated with synaptic loss, but rather with disruption of the first
heminodes at the auditory nerve peripheral terminal. Thus, this study identifies a new
mechanism for HHL, highlights the long-term consequences of transient Schwann cell loss on
hearing and might provide insights into the causes of the auditory deficits reported in patients
that recover from acute demyelinating diseases such as Guillain–Barre
´ syndrome.

n the mammalian cochlea, acoustic stimuli are detected by
inner hair cells (IHCs), which transduce and transform them
into synaptic signals to the primary auditory sensory neurons,
the spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs). These neurons then relay the
acoustic information to the central auditory circuits. Thus, proper
function of both sensory cells and neurons is essential for normal
hearing and auditory communication, and degeneration of either
component causes sensorineural hearing loss. This type of
hearing loss, which affects 320 million people worldwide1,
is characterized by permanent elevation of auditory thresholds,
that is, the minimal sound pressure levels (SPLs) that evoke an
auditory or neural response at specific sound frequencies. Until
recently, it was believed that auditory processing is normal in
subjects with normal thresholds, even after recovery from a
temporary threshold shift (TTS) due to noise exposure, and that
hearing deficits in those cases were due to central problems2.
However, recent animal and human studies indicate that
moderate noise exposures or ageing can result in a new form of
peripheral hearing loss called ‘hidden hearing loss (HHL)’3–6.
HHL can be detected physiologically and is characterized
by normal auditory thresholds but reduced suprathreshold
amplitude
of
the
sound-evoked
SGN
compound
action
potential (AP) (the first peak of the auditory brainstem
response (ABR) waveform)3,5–8, and by the alteration in the
ratio between the peak of the ABR waveform generated by hair
cells (summating potential (SP)) and the peak I of the ABR
waveform (AP)9. The reduced neuronal activation seen in HHL
has been proposed to result in degradation of the temporal coding
of suprathreshold sounds and deficits in speech discrimination
and intelligibility, particularly in a noisy environment10,11;
however, the latter are not diagnostic of HHL, as they could be
also caused by central processing deficits. HHL has been
proposed
to
lead
to
hyperactivation
of
central
auditory
synapses, thus possibly contributing to tinnitus3,12. Until now,
loss or dysfunction of IHC synapses has been the only proposed
mechanism of HHL13. Here we report an additional cellular
mechanism for HHL.
In the cochlea, sensory hair cells and neurons are in close
association with several types of glial and glia-like cells14.
Hair cells are surrounded by supporting cells, SGN axons are
myelinated by Schwann cells and spiral ganglion cell bodies
are wrapped by satellite cells (Fig. 1a). In prior studies
we explored the roles of supporting cells in IHC synapse
formation and regeneration15 and in the preservation of hair
cells16. As part of our ongoing efforts to define the roles the
different populations of cochlear glia play in hearing and
deafness15–17, we investigated the consequences of Schwann cell
ablation in the mature cochlea. We found that acute Schwann
cell loss causes rapid auditory nerve demyelination, which is
followed by robust Schwann cell regeneration and axonal
remyelination. Surprisingly, this transient Schwann cell loss
results in a permanent auditory impairment characteristic of
HHL. However, this HHL differs from that seen after noise
exposure or ageing in that it occurs without alterations in
synaptic density but rather correlates with a specific and
permanent disruptions of the first heminodes at the auditory
nerve axon close to the IHCs. Furthermore, the two types of HHL
occur independently (noise exposures that cause HHL do not
disrupt heminodes) and they are additive. Together, these results
uncover a new mechanism for the pathogenesis of HHL and a
new consequence of myelin defects on the normal function of the
nervous system.

 Results
Ablation and regeneration of Schwann cells in mature cochlea.
To test the consequence of Schwann and satellite cell ablation on
the cochlea, we used conditional expression of diphtheria toxin
fragment A (DTA) in proteolipid protein 1 (Plp1)-expressing cells
at P21. This strategy was based on the pattern of Plp1 promoter
activity in the postnatal cochlea. As shown in Fig. 1, in the
neonatal mouse cochlea (P1–P15) Plp1 is expressed by Schwann
cells, satellite cells, as well as inner phalangeal and inner border
cells (IPhC/IBCs), the supporting cells surrounding IHCs18.
However, by P21 Plp1 promoter activity in IPhC/IBCs is
undetectable (Fig. 1a–e), while is maintained in Schwann cells
along the auditory nerve fibres (ANFs) located at the osseous
spiral lamina (OSL) (Fig. 1a,f–i) and satellite cells surrounding the
cell bodies of SGNs in Rosenthal’s canal (Fig. 1a,j–m).
As anticipated from prior studies of mice with DTA-induced
ablation of Plp1-expressing cells19, tamoxifen intraperitoneal
(i.p.) injection to mice carrying Plp1/CreERT transgene and
Rosa26DTA alleles [DTA( þ / � ):Plp1/Cre( þ / � )] from P21
to 23 resulted in uncoordinated gait and hind-limb paralysis
between 1 and 2 weeks post DTA expression followed by
complete recovery of normal gait by 3–4 weeks post DTA
expression. This is consistent with the robust regenerative
capacity of Plp1-expressing glia cells19. Interestingly, although
DTA induction at P35 results in significant mortality 3 weeks
later (ref. 19 and our unpublished data), we found that ablation of
Plp1-expressing cells at P21 does not result in lethality. These
observations suggest that the health effects of loss of Plp1 þ cells
increase with age.
Based on the findings described in Fig. 1, we anticipated that
tamoxifen treatment of DTA( þ / � )/PlpCre1( þ / � ) mice from
P21 to P23 would ablate Schwann and satellite cells without
affecting the supporting cells in the organ of Corti. Indeed,
immunostaining of cochlear whole mounts with the Schwann cell
marker Sox10 or myelin basic protein (MBP) showed that DTA
transgene activation at P21 results in robust ablation of Schwann
cells along the ANFs within 1 week after tamoxifen injection
(Supplementary Fig. 1a–d). In contrast, IPhC/IBCs, which are
labelled by Sox2 or GLAST, are spared from DTA-mediated
ablation at this age (Supplementary Fig. 1e,f). With this model in
hand, we analysed the effects of the Schwann cell loss on cochlear
structure and function at different intervals, from 1 week to 1 year
after induction of Schwann cell ablation.
Studies of other peripheral nerves have demonstrated that
demyelination and Schwann cell loss is usually followed by
extensive proliferation of undifferentiated Schwann cells, which
repopulate and remyelinate the nerves20,21. Accordingly, analysis
of 5-ethynyl-20-deoxyuridine (EdU) incorporation showed that 1
week after DTA transgene activation, the auditory nerves of mice
with Schwann cell ablation display a dramatic increase in the
number of EdU þ cells (Fig. 2c,d) compared with controls
(Fig. 2a,b). Furthermore, lineage tracing with an inducible

in
DTA( þ / � ):tdTomato( þ / � ):Plp1/
Cre( þ / � ) mice revealed that these EdU-positive cells are
generated by Plp1-expressing cells that most probably escaped
DTA-mediated ablation (Fig. 2e–h), that is, Schwann cells in
which recombination occurred in the Rosa26tdTomato allele but
not in the Rosa26DTA allele. Further analysis showed that the
surviving tdTomato þ cells 1 week post induction (Fig. 2i,j)
repopulate the OSL to levels similar to that of controls by 1
month post induction (Fig. 2k,l).
Similar robust regeneration was observed for satellite cells
(Supplementary Fig. 2). Although satellite cells are clearly lost 1
week post induction (Supplementary Fig. 2a,b), they repopulate
within 2 weeks post induction in DTA( þ / � ):Plp1/eGFP( þ / � ):
Plp1/Cre( þ / � ) cochlea
(Supplementary
Fig.
2c,d).
Plastic
sections of Rosenthal’s canal 16 weeks post induction show that
both the SGN cell body density (Supplementary Fig. 2e–g) and
the percentage of SGN cell bodies wrapped by satellite cells
(Supplementary
Fig.
2e,f,h)
are
similar
in
DTA( þ / � ):
Plp1/Cre( þ / � ) and control cochlea. Together, these results
indicate that cochlear Schwann and satellite cells spontaneously
and robustly repopulate after DTA-mediated ablation in the
mature cochlea, and that Schwann cell regeneration is at least
partly mediated by proliferation of the surviving Schwann cells.
Schwann cell regeneration and remyelination of SGN axons.
In models of axon injury or demyelinating neuropathy, damaged
Schwann cells regenerate and re-myelinate axons20,22,23. We
therefore examined the consequence of DTA-induced Schwann cell
ablation on ANF myelin. DTA expression resulted in acute
demyelination
of
the
ANFs
within
1
week
post
induction
(Fig. 3a,b), consistent with loss of Schwann cell markers at this
time point (Supplementary Fig. 1). At 4 weeks post induction, when
Schwann cells have repopulated (Fig. 2i,j), we observed significant yet
incomplete remyelination (Fig. 3a,b). By 16 weeks post induction,
myelinated axon density completely recovered in DTA(þ /� ):Plp1/
Cre(þ /� ) cochleas (Fig. 3a,b). Moreover, at 16 weeks post
induction, axons from DTA(þ /� ):Plp1/Cre(þ /� ) cochleas had

 normal axon diameters (Fig. 3c,e,g) and myelin thickness (Fig. 3d,f,g).
These results indicate that acute Schwann cell ablation results in
rapid cell regeneration followed by remarkable remyelination, leading
to fibres with normal axon caliber and myelin thickness.
Transient Schwann cell ablation causes permanent HHL.
Conduction block is the fundamental finding in clinically
important acquired demyelinating neuropathies such as acute
inflammatory
demyelinating
polyneuropathy
and
chronic
inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy24. Therefore, given
the dramatic demyelination we observed in ANFs on activation of
the DTA transgene, we anticipated that mice would display
significant hearing abnormalities soon after induction, and that
these defects would resolve within 4 months as the nerve
remyelinated. However, thresholds for the ABR and distortion
product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE), which reflect the
function of IHCs and outer hair cells, respectively, were not
affected by the lack of myelin in ANFs (Supplementary Fig. 3a,b),
indicating that these mice were ‘audiologically normal.’ In
contrast, the suprathreshold amplitudes of the ABR peak 1 (P1
amplitudes), which represent the summed activity of the SGNs,
were significantly reduced (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Fig. 4).
Furthermore, the suprathreshold latencies and widths of the ABR
peak 1, which reflect in part the conduction velocity of the
auditory nerve, were both severely affected (Fig. 4b,c and
Supplementary Fig. 5). Specifically, mice with DTA-induced
Schwann cell ablation have increased P1 latencies (Fig. 4b and
Supplementary Fig. 5) and P1 widths (Fig. 4c) at all cochlear
frequencies examined (5.6–32 kHz). Surprisingly, the effects of
Schwann cell ablation on P1 amplitudes, latencies and widths do
not reverse even 16 weeks post induction, when Schwann cells
and myelin have regenerated (Figs 2 and 3 and Supplementary
Fig. 2). Further support to the conclusion that the transient
demyelination results in HHL was provided by analysis of the
SP/AP ratios (amplitudes of SP/amplitudes of AP) (Fig. 5a), which
can be used as a differential diagnosis for HHL in both mice and
humans5,9. Transient Schwann cell ablation did not affect SP at all
time points (Fig. 5b), further demonstrating that Schwann cell loss
did not alter hair cell function (Supplementary Figs 1 and 3). In
contrast, peak 1 AP amplitudes in DTA(þ / � ):Plp1/Cre( þ / � )
mice were reduced at all time points (Fig. 5c), suggestive of
cochlear neural dysfunction. Furthermore, SP/AP ratios were
significantly reduced 4–16 weeks after Schwann cell ablation
(Fig. 5d). These findings indicate that transient Schwann cell
ablation results in prolonged auditory neuropathy and HHL.
Demyelination-induced HHL is not caused by synapse loss.
Loss of synapses between IHCs and SGNs is currently the only

 known histological correlate of HHL10,11 and synapse loss has
been reported to occur in some demyelinating disorders, for
example, in Charcot–Marie–Tooth (CMT) disease25 and multiple
sclerosis26. Therefore, we analysed the density of IHC ribbon
synapses in control and demyelinated mice by immunostaining
for the presynaptic ribbon and postsynaptic receptor patches
using antibodies against CtBP2 and GluA2 (ref. 15). At 4 weeks
post induction, when remyelination was complete but HHL was
robust, IHC synapse density was the same in DTA( þ / � ):
Plp1/Cre( þ / � ) and control cochleas at all regions examined
(Fig. 6). This data indicates that transient loss of glial cells results
in prolonged auditory deficits and HHL by a mechanism that is
distinct from cochlear synaptopathy.
HHL is associated with permanent heminodal disruption.
The observation that ABR P1 latency is longer after transient
demyelination suggested that other aspects of myelin–axon
interactions
could
be
disrupted.
Therefore,
we
examined
whether the transient demyelination alters node of Ranvier
density in auditory axons. Immunostaining for the paranodal
protein Caspr27 in combination with the myelin protein Plp1
showed that in the control P30 cochlea, nodes of Ranvier can be
clearly observed along the ANFs in OSL (Fig. 7a), whereas
heminodes formed by the first Schwann cells close to the IHCs
can be seen at the habenula perforata (HP), the perforations in
the OSL through which auditory fibres pass on their way to and
from the organ of Corti (Fig. 7a, see also Fig. 1a). Interestingly,
the first 50 mm of the auditory nerve after the heminodes has a
low density of nodes of Ranvier, indicating that consistent
with previous reports28,29, the myelin segments generated by
the Schwann cells closest to the IHC are about that length.
As expected for a severely demyelinated nerve, the appearance
of
nodes
and
heminodes
was
disrupted
in
DTA( þ / � ):
Plp1/Cre( þ / � ) cochlea 1 week after DTA induction (Fig. 7b).
Quantification of nodal density using co-immunostaining for
Caspr and the nodal protein gliomedin30 showed that 1 week
after Schwann cell ablation, many nodes of Ranvier are lost in
the OSL and the remaining ones have irregular appearance
(Fig. 7c,d,i). Yet, consistent with the extensive remyelination,
node of Ranvier density in the OSL completely regenerated by
4 weeks post induction, their appearance being indistinguishable
from the controls (Fig. 7c–i).
In contrast, at the heminode zone and the area occupied by the
first Schwann cells, Caspr and gliomedin localization did not
recover normally. As shown in Fig. 7a,b, heminodes are
dramatically disrupted 1 week after Schwann cell ablation
compared with the control (Fig. 8a,b). In the control normal
cochlea (Fig. 8a,c,e), the heminodal immunostaining is tightly
clustered within the last 20 mm segments of the myelinated axon
terminals (herein defined as the heminode zone). Although there
is significant recovery of Caspr and gliomedin localization at

 heminodes during the postinduction period, it does not return to
control levels 4 months after the insult (Fig. 8b,d,f). Moreover,
aberrant localization of nodal proteins is observed proximal to the
heminode zone (Fig. 8d,f, below dashed lines and Fig. 8g),
whereas virtually no nodal proteins are present in that area in
controls. Immunostaining for other nodal markers (sodium
channels (NaV), ankyrin G (AnkG) and b4-spectrin) also shows
disruption of heminodal organization in DTA( þ / � ):Plp1/
Cre( þ / � ) cochlea, further supporting the notion that Schwann
cell–axon interactions in the area close to the HP are permanently
affected by transient Schwann cell ablation (Supplementary
Fig. 6). In contrast to the robust remyelination observed along
the OSL, dysmyelinated fibres were observed at the axon
segments closer to the HP. Immunostaining for neurofilament
heavy chain (NFH), which labels unmyelinated axons31, labelled
nerve fibres below the HP in the DTA( þ / � ):Plp1/Cre( þ / � )
cochlea but not in controls (Fig. 8h,i). Electron micrographs at
the HP also illustrate the presence of unmyelinated fibres in
DTA( þ / � ):Plp1/Cre( þ / � ) mice but not in controls (Fig. 8j,k).
HHL persists 1 year after Schwann cell ablation. To determine
whether the pathology observed 16 weeks after insult resolves
with time, we studied a cohort of mice one year after DTA
induction and found that the pathology remained unchanged.
ABR thresholds remained normal in the DTA( þ / � ):Plp1/
Cre( þ / � ) mice (Supplementary Fig. 7a), indicating that the
transient Schwann cell degeneration did not jeopardize long-term
cochlea health. However, similar to that in the earlier time points,
ABR P1 amplitudes, latencies and widths remained abnormal and
indicative of auditory neuropathy (Supplementary Fig. 7b–d).
Furthermore, node of Ranvier markers remained disorganized in
the HP region (Supplementary Fig. 7g,h) but not at the OSL
(Supplementary Fig. 7e,f) in the DTA( þ / � ):Plp1/Cre( þ / � )
cochlea. In addition, unmyelinated axon segments at the HP
region were also present (Supplementary Fig. 7i,j). These results
demonstrate compromised Schwann cell–axon interactions in
this specific domain within the auditory nerve even 1 year after
transient Schwann cell loss.
Noise exposure causes HHL without affecting heminodes.
Exposure of rodents to noise levels higher than those that induce
TTSs and HHL (110 versus 98 dB SPL) results in permanent
hearing loss (permanent threshold shifts) and central auditory
demyelination32, raising the possibility that exposure to noise that
induce TTS and HHL could also affect auditory nerve nodal
structures. Therefore, we generated HHL in wild-type mice by
exposing them to an octave-band noise (8–16 kHz, 98 dB SPL for
2 h)4,33. Two weeks after noise exposure, both ABR and DPOAE
thresholds had recovered (Supplementary Fig. 8a,b), whereas the
suprathreshold ABR P1 amplitudes were reduced at higher
frequencies (Supplementary Fig. 8c). Consistent with previous
reports15,34, ABR P1 latencies were not significantly affected by
noise exposure (Supplementary Fig. 8d), whereas ribbon synapse
loss was evident at 32 kHz but not 11.3 kHz, consistent with a
high-frequency
HHL
due
to
synaptopathy
(Supplementary
Fig. 8e–i). In contrast, the heminodes at the HP appeared
normal (Supplementary Fig. 8j–m), suggesting that exposure to
synaptopathic noise does not alter nodal organization.
Noise- and demyelination-induced HHL are additive. The
results described above indicate that two different types of HHL
exist: one caused by noise and involving synaptopathy, and the
other caused by transient Schwann cell loss and involving nodal
disruption. To test whether these two forms of HHL interact, we
subjected mice that had undergone demyelination (DTA( þ / � ):
Plp1/Cre( þ / � )) at 3 weeks of age and their control counterparts
(DTA( þ / � ) mice) to noise exposure that causes synaptopathy
at 8 weeks of age, and analysed their auditory function 2 weeks
later (Fig. 9a). As shown above, 4 weeks after DTA-mediated
Schwann cell ablation mice displayed HHL involving alterations
in ABR Peak 1 amplitude and latency (Fig. 9b–d), which persisted
even after noise exposure (Fig. 9e–g). Remarkably, noise exposure
induced further decrease in ABR Peak 1 amplitudes beyond the
one produced by demyelination (Fig. 9h–j) and the magnitudes of
the shift in amplitudes were the same as in mice that had no
demyelination (Fig. 9k–p). Furthermore, ABR P1 latencies
remained unaffected after noise exposure in both demyelinated
and control mice, indicating that the noise produced the
same type of pathology independent of the prior demyelination
(Fig. 9j,m,p). These findings indicate that exposure to synapto-
pathic noise causes additional degradation of neural output from
the cochlea even when mice already suffer from HHL caused by
transient Schwann cell loss. Thus, HHL caused by transient
Schwann cell ablation is mechanistically distinct from that
resulting from cochlear synaptopathy.
Discussion
Myelination of the peripheral nervous system (PNS) is important
for normal conduction of APs and synchronized transmission of
neural impulses35,36, and damage to peripheral axons and their
myelin sheaths causes many forms of peripheral neuropathy,
such as CMT disease and Guillain–Barre
´ syndrome (GBS)37–39.
In this study, we uncover a new consequence of myelin pathology;
that is, that transient Schwann cell loss results in permanent
disruption of the cochlear heminodal structure and organization.
We also discover that such disruption causes auditory neuropathy
and HHL.

 Both cochlear type I afferents (SGNs) and medial olivocochlear
efferents
are
myelinated32;
however,
it
is
unlikely
that
the auditory deficits we found after transient Schwann cell
ablation are caused by damage to cochlear efferent nerves. First,
sound-evoked medial olivocochlear activity is greatly depressed
by anaesthesia during physiological recordings, thus should
contribute little to our measurements of ABR amplitudes. Most
importantly, complete lesion of cochlear efferent nerves fails to
impair ABR peak 1 latencies (Maison et al.40 and Liberman M.C.,
personal communications), further arguing against possible
contribution of efferent nerves towards the auditory deficits
observed in this study.
The bipolar SGNs form point-to-point connections between
the sensory hair cells and neurons in the cochlear nucleus. At the
SGN peripheral processes, the unmyelinated afferent terminals
are
tightly
coupled
to
the
ribbon
synapses,
whereas
the
myelinated axons extend from the HP to the SGN somata
(Fig. 1a). Once the central SGN process enters the central nervous
system (CNS), it becomes myelinated by oligodendrocytes. We
used a mouse model of demyelination that results in loss of both
Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system and oligoden-
drocytes in the CNS. However, our physiological techniques allow
us to study cochlear function without confounding issues from
CNS demyelination by specifically analysing ABR peak 1. It has
been shown both experimentally and computationally that ABR
peak 1 is solely contributed by the IHCs and SGNs41,42, which are
myelinated by Schwann cells. In addition, the first heminode at
the HP formed by Schwann cells is believed to be the initial
spike generator of the SGNs28,29,43. Moreover, it has been shown
that in this mouse model CNS neurons remyelinate robustly and
recover function after DTA-mediated oligodendrocyte ablation19,
further
excluding
the
involvement
of
central
auditory
components in this study. Thus, the physiological changes we
observed after Schwann cell ablation are most likely due to
alterations in the peripheral auditory components, that is, SGN
synaptic terminal, axon or somata myelination or neuronal
survival (refer to Fig. 1a).
Synaptic dysfunction is known to result in defects in SGN
neural amplitudes and latencies6,44. However, synaptic density
was not affected by Schwann cell ablation and demyelination.
Although we did not examine whether synapses were transiently
disrupted, it is unlikely to be that transient synaptopathy, if it
occurred, could contribute to the persistent pathophysiology,
as we have shown that when synapses regenerate after acute
loss the auditory deficits recover as well15. As with the nerve
terminals, the SGN cell bodies were also unaffected after transient
loss of Schwann and satellite cells. Satellite cells express glutamine
synthetase for converting ammonia and glutamate to glutamine45,
which is important for metabolizing excess glutamate and
preventing excitotoxicity46. Satellite cells are also important for
neuronal survival as knockout of sapB from these cells resulted
in progressive neuronal death47. Complete regeneration of the
spiral ganglion satellite cells in our study is consistent with the
remarkable spontaneous proliferation and regeneration of satellite
cells in other sensory ganglia48–50. Timely regeneration of the
satellite cells and wrapping on SGN cell bodies may be important
to preserve the survival and function of the SGNs.
In animal models of central and peripheral demyelinating
diseases, many axons remyelinate but with significantly thinner
myelin sheaths and shorter internodal lengths51,52. Intriguingly,

 after
transient
Schwann
cell
loss
and
massive
axonal
demyelination in response to DTA expression, we observed
complete remyelination of ANFs at the OSL featuring normal
myelin thickness and nodal density. It is worth noting that DTA
induction results in damage to the myelinating glial cells without
directly injuring their associated neurons. In contrast, in other
animal models of demyelinating disorders axons may also be
injured, for example, by nerve crush or inflammation53,54. These
findings suggest that intact axons, but not injured ones, are
capable of providing both physical and chemical cues sufficient
for normal remyelination55. Our findings are consistent with a
previous report in which complete remyelination was observed in
sciatic nerve after selective ablation of myelinating glial cells56.
A recent report shows that in the CNS, remyelination and normal
nodal length can be completely restored on small caliber axons,
suggesting that complete myelin recovery may be dependent on
axon caliber57. Thus, an alternative scenario is that complete
remyelination of the ANFs can be attributed to their smaller
axon caliber (B1.5 mm diameter) compared with other peripheral
nervous system axons, such as ventral roots and quadriceps
nerves (43 mm diameter)58,59.
Analysis of node of Ranvier markers indicated specific and
persistent disruption of the heminodes at the HP, but with
complete recovery of nodes along the axonal tracts. Emerging
evidence indicates that AP generation in the auditory nerve
occurs at the heminode28,29,43 and the clustering of mature
heminodes may be important for tight coupling of IHC synaptic
transmission and ANF spike generation29. The peak 1 of the
ABR waveform, which reflects the gross ANF discharge, relies
on concerted nerve conduction from the unmyelinated nerve
terminals (inner spiral plexus), the heminodes (the spike
generator) and the nodes of Ranvier29. The inner spiral plexus
is unlikely to be involved in the observed pathophysiology,
because the precisely timed short-latency nerve conduction is
ensured by multiple mechanisms43. The complete recovery of
nodes of Ranvier also precludes their contributions. As the highly
clustered heminodes allow generation of synchronized AP spikes
in multiple unisynaptic ANFs28,29,43, we propose that AP
dyssynchronization resulting from heminodal disruption is the
main contributor to the loss of temporal resolution in the
waveform and therefore to the deterioration of peak 1 amplitude,
latency and width.
The postsynaptic heminodes are typically clustered about
20 mm away from the IHC synaptic zone and are enriched in ion
channels28,29. Recent studies indicate that these structural and
molecular features of auditory nerve nodes and heminodes
mature after the onset of hearing in rats29. Specifically, during the
early postnatal ages (oP17), the immature heminodes lack Kv1.1
channels and are irregularly positioned along individual axons
with about 60 mm spread from the HP29. Interestingly, the
pathological heminodes observed in this study closely resembled
those seen before hearing onset29. Therefore, it appears that
during the process of Schwann cell regeneration, remyelination
of ANFs follows a path similar to the one taking place during

 early postnatal development, but remyelination and heminode
maturation at the HP fail to proceed, possibly due to either the
presence of inhibitory signals in the mature cochlea or lack of
promoting factors that are present during development. As
heminodes and nodes share similar molecular microdomain
structure28,29 and nodes of Ranvier recovere completely, the
observed nodal pathology is likely to be due to the physical–
chemical micro-environments at the HP, rather than a generic
axoglial signal guiding the nodal assembly.
HHL has emerged as a major health concern13. HHL is defined
and diagnosed by abnormal ABR amplitudes and latencies
but
normal
thresholds9–11,
thus
undetectable
by
standard
audiometry. Subjects with this type of hearing loss may have
difficulties in speech discrimination and temporal processing,
particularly in a noisy environment13. Until now, synaptic loss
or cochlear synaptopathy resulting from either noise exposure or
ageing was the only known cause of HHL5,6 and exploration of
therapeutic approaches for HHL has been focused on repairing
synapses15,33. Our findings indicate that HHL can also arise from
pathologies of cochlear Schwann cell (schwannopathy) or nodal
structures
(nodopathy),
rather
than
synaptopathy.
Indeed,
some patients with demyelinating disorders such as CMT
disease and GBS have auditory deficits, associated with reduced
ABR amplitudes and increased latencies60–64. Our animal model
shares mechanistic similarities with GBS, where Schwann cells
are specifically and transiently damaged52. Our findings that
Schwann cell ablation does not affect ABR or DPOAE thresholds
are consistent with rare reports of hearing threshold elevations in
GBS patients63,64. Intriguingly, in those patients who suffered
acute
hearing
loss,
although
hearing
threshold
gradually
recovered, their ABR waveforms showed persistent increase in
latency62. Therefore, an even greater proportion of GBS patients
may have HHL that has not been diagnosed clinically. Given the
growing prevalence of Zika infections, which has been shown to
correlate with an increase in GBS patients worldwide65,66, the
prevalence of HHL related to acute peripheral demyelinating
disorders is likely to increase. Thus, the cochlear neuropathy
revealed in our animal model may have clinical implications in
diagnosis and eventual treatment of the different types of HHL.
Methods
Animals. Plp1/CreERT (Plp1/Cre; stock number 005975), Ai14:Rosa26tdTomato
(tdTomato; stock number 007908) and Rosa26DTA (DTA; stock number 006331)
transgenic mice of both genders were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory.
Plp1/eGFP mice were obtained from Wendy Macklin at the University of
Colorado, Denver. To express DTA in cochlear myelinating glial cells, we crossed
Plp1/Cre( þ / � ) with DTA( þ / þ ) mice. Cre-negative littermates were used as
controls. For lineage-tracing experiments, Plp1/Cre( þ / � ):tdTomato( þ / � ) or
Plp1/Cre( þ / � ):Plp1/eGFP( þ / � ) mice were crossed with DTA( þ / � ) mice.
Offsprings carrying all three alleles were used for experiments and DTA-negative
littermates were used as controls. All mice used in this work were on a mixed
background containing C57Bl6 and FVB/N strains, and mice tested for auditory
physiology were heterozygous for ahl allele. Both males and females were used in
this study. The genotypes of the control and experimental animals were blinded to
the investigators until the completion of data acquisition and analysis. All animal
procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of
University of Michigan.
Tamoxifen and EdU injections. Tamoxifen (Sigma, T5648) was dissolved in corn
oil (Sigma, C8267) at 37 �C to obtain 10 mg ml � 1 working solution. Mice were
injected i.p. with tamoxifen at 50 mg kg � 1 per day from P21 to P23. Animals were
analysed at 1 week to 1 year after the last tamoxifen injection. To examine cell
proliferation, P29 mice were i.p. injected with EdU (obtained from the Click-iT
EdU Alexa Fluor 488 Imaging Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, C10337)) once at
10 mg kg � 1 dosage. Mice were killed and tissue analysed at P30. EdU staining was
performed following the manufacturer’s instructions.
ABR and DPOAE analyses. ABRs and DPOAEs were performed on mice
anaesthetized with xylazine (20 mg kg � 1, i.p.) and ketamine (100 mg kg � 1, i.p.).
For ABR recordings, needle electrodes were placed into the skin (a) at the dorsal
midline close to the neural crest, (b) behind the left pinna and (c) at the base of the
tail (for a ground electrode). ABR potentials were evoked with 5 ms tone pips
(0.5 ms rise–fall, with a cos2 envelope, at 40 s � 1) delivered to the eardrum at
log-spaced frequencies from 5.6 to 32 kHz. The response was amplified (10,000 � )
and filtered (0.3–3 kHz) with an analog-to-digital board in a PC-based
data-acquisition system. Sound level was raised in 5 dB steps from 10 to 80 dB SPL.
At each level, 1,024 responses were averaged (with stimulus polarity alternated)
after ‘artefact rejection.’ The DPOAEs in response to two primary tones of
frequency f1 and f2 were recorded at (2 � f1) � f2, with f2/f1 ¼ 1.2, and the f2 level
10 dB lower than the f1 level. Ear-canal sound pressure was amplified and digitally
sampled at 4 ms intervals. DPOAE thresholds were defined as the f1 level required
to produce a response at � 10 dB SPL. Both ABR and DPOAE recordings were
performed using EPL cochlear function test suite (Mass Eye and Ear, Boston, MA,
USA). ABR peak amplitudes, latencies and widths were analysed with excel and
ABR peak analysis software (Mass Eye and Ear).
Noise exposure. Awake wild-type FVB/N mice or DTA( þ / � ):Plp1/Cre( þ / � )
and their control mice were placed within small cells in a subdivided cage,
suspended in a reverberant noise exposure chamber. FVB/N mice (16 weeks)
were exposed to an octave band of noise (8–16 kHz) at 100 dB SPL for 2 h.
DTA( þ / � ):Plp1/Cre( þ / � ) and control mice (8 weeks) were exposed to the
same noise at 98 dB SPL for 2 h. Calibration of noise was performed immediately
before each noise overexposure to ensure that SPL levels varied by o1 dB across
the cages.
Immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy. Inner ear tissues were dis-
sected and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer for 30 min–2 h
at room temperature, followed by decalcification in 5% EDTA at 4 �C for 5 days.
Cochlear tissues were microdissected and permeabilized by freeze–thawing in 30%
sucrose. The microdissected tissues were incubated in blocking buffer containing
5% normal horse serum and 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS for 1 h. Tissues were then
incubated in primary antibodies (diluted in blocking buffer) at 37 �C for 16 h. The
primary antibodies used in this study were as follows: anti-myosin VIIa15 (rabbit
anti-Myo7a; Proteus Biosciences, Ramona, CA; 1:500), anti-Sox2 (goat anti-Sox2;
sc-17320, Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Santa Cruz, CA; 1:200)16, anti-Sox10 (goat
anti-Sox10; sc-17342, Santa Cruz Biotechnologies; 1:200)67, anti-MBP (rat anti-
MBP; MAB386, EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA; 1:1,000)67, anti-carboxy-terminal
binding protein 2 (mouse anti-Ctbp2 IgG1; BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA; 1:200)15,
anti-glutamate receptor 2 (mouse anti-GluA2 IgG2a; Millipore, Billerica, MA;
1:2,000)15, anti-NFH (chicken anti-NFH; AB5539, EMD Millipore; 1:2,000)31,
anti-Plp1 (gift of Wendy Macklin; 1:500)16, anti-Caspr (gift of Roman Giger;
1:1,000)68, anti-gliomedin (gift of Elior Peles; 1:500)30, anti-pan sodium channel
(anti-NaV; gift of Roman Giger; 1:75)68, anti-b4-spectrin and anti-Ankyrin G
(gifts of Paul Jenkins; 1:500)69. Tissues were then incubated with appropriate Alexa
Fluor-conjugated fluorescent secondary antibodies (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA;
1:500 in blocking buffer) for 1 h at room temperature. Nuclei were labelled with
either 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (1 mg ml � 1; Life Technologies) or Hoechst
33342 (1:2,000; Life Technologies). The tissues were mounted on microscope slides
in ProLong Gold Antifade Mountant (P36930, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Unless
otherwise stated, mid-apical cochlear tissues (8–16 kHz region) were used for
analyses.
Confocal z-stacks (0.3 mm step size) of cochlear tissues were taken using
either a Zeiss LSM710 or a Leica SP8 microscope equipped with � 40 and � 63
oil-immersion lens. Images for quantitative analyses of the nodal structures were
taken under � 63 lens with � 5 optical zoom. Imaging and analyses of cochlear
ribbon synapses were performed as previously described15. ImageJ software
(version 1.46r, NIH, MD) was used for image processing and three-dimensional
reconstruction of z-stacks. All immunofluorescence images shown are
representative of at least three individual mice each group.
Plastic sections and transmission electron microscopy. Mice were perfused
intracardially with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer. Cochleae
were then extracted and postfixed with 1.5% paraformaldehyde and 2.5%
glutaraldehyde, followed by osmification in 1% osmium tetroxide, decalcification in
5% EDTA, dehydration in ethanol and embedding in araldite resin. The embedded
cochleae were hardened at 60 �C for 5 days before semi-thin (1 mm) plastic
sectioning for light microscopy and ultra-thin (70 nm) sectioning for transmission
electron microscopy using a Leica UC6 ultramicrotome. The semi-thin sections
were mounted on microscope slides in Permount (Fisher Scientific) and the SGN
cell bodies imaged under light microscope using � 63 lens.
Ultra-thin sections were sequentially poststained with 6% w/v uranyl acetate
and 4.4% w/v lead citrate. Transmission electron microscopy was performed on
Jeol 1400-plus electron microscope (Jeol USA, Peabody, MA). Multiple
non-overlapping regions of the ANF cross-sections were imaged at � 3,400
magnification. The circumference of each axon fibre and axon fibre plus myelin
sheath was measured using ImageJ software. Axon diameters were estimated as
circumference/p and the g-ratio was calculated as axon diameter / (axon þ myelin
sheath diameter). Axons with circularity (4 � p � area/perimeter2) under 6 were

 excluded from analysis. All images of semi-thin sections and electron microscope
sections shown are representative of at least three individual mice each group.
Statistical analysis. Statistical tests were performed using Graphpad Prism 6
(Graphpad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA). Distribution of the data was assumed to be
normal, but this was not formally tested. No statistical methods were used
predetermine sample sizes, but our sample sizes are similar to those reported in our
previous publications15,16,70. Statistical differences in auditory physiology, ribbon
synapse counts, densities of myelinated axons, densities of nodes and aberrant
nodes were analysed using two-way ANOVA, followed by Bonferroni’s multiple
comparisons test. Densities of SGN cell bodies and percentages of SGN cell bodies
wrapped by satellite cells were compared using unpaired Student’s t-test. w2-test
and frequency distribution plots were used to compare the distribution of axon
diameters and g-ratios (axon diameter/(axon þ myelin sheath diameter) (300–500
axons from 3 mice per group). Student’s t-test was also used to compare the
average axon diameter and g-ratio of each mouse.
Data availability. All relevant data are included in the manuscript or its
Supplementary Information and available from the authors upon request.
