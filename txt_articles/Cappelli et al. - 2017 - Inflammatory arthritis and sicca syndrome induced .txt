ABSTRACT
Objectives Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs)
targeting the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4
(CTLA-4) and programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)
pathways have demonstrated survival improvements in
multiple advanced cancers, but also cause immune-
related adverse events (IRAEs). IRAEs with clinical
features similar to rheumatic diseases have not been well
described. We report patients with inflammatory arthritis
and sicca syndrome secondary to ICIs.
Methods We report patients evaluated in the Johns
Hopkins Rheumatology clinics from 2012 to 2016
identified as having new rheumatological symptoms in
the context of treatment with ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4)
and/or nivolumab (anti-PD-1) for solid tumours.
Results We identified 13 patients who received ICIs
and developed rheumatological IRAEs. Mean age was
58.7 years. Cancer types included melanoma, non-small
cell lung cancer, small cell lung cancer and renal cell
carcinoma. ICI regimens included nivolumab or
ipilimumab as monotherapy (n=5), or combination
nivolumab and ipilimumab (n=8). Nine of 13 patients
developed an inflammatory arthritis, 4 with synovitis
confirmed on imaging (3 ultrasound, 1 MRI) and 4 with
inflammatory synovial fluid. Four patients developed
sicca syndrome with severe salivary hypofunction. Other
IRAEs included: pneumonitis, colitis, interstitial nephritis
and thyroiditis. Antinuclear antibodies were positive in 5
out of 13 patients. All 13 patients were treated with
corticosteroids with varying response. Two patients were
treated with methotrexate and antitumor necrosis factor
therapy for inflammatory arthritis.
Conclusions As ICIs are increasingly used for a range
of malignancies, new cases of rheumatic IRAEs are likely
to emerge. Further research is required to understand
mechanisms, determine risk factors and develop
management algorithms for rheumatic IRAEs.
INTRODUCTION
In recent years, harnessing the power of a patient’s
immune system to treat cancer has been an increas-
ingly efficacious treatment strategy in oncology.1
Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) targeting cyto-
toxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4),
specifically ipilimumab, and programmed cell death
protein 1 (PD-1), nivolumab and pembrolizumab,
and the combination of ipilimumab with nivolumab
have
been
Food
and
Drug
Administration
(FDA)-approved for the treatment of metastatic
melanoma.2–4 In the European Union, ipilimumab
was approved for metastatic melanoma in 2013,5
with
pembrolizumab
and
nivolumab
approved
within the past year. Nivolumab and pembrolizu-
mab are also FDA-approved for metastatic non-
small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in the second-line
setting
and
for
programmed
death
ligand
1
(PDL-1)-positive
NSCLCs,6
and
nivolumab
has
approval for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma
(RCC).7 In addition, these and other agents target-
ing related immune pathways, including PDL-1,
T-cell
immunoglobulin
and
mucin
domain
3
(TIM-3)
and
lymphocyte
activation
gene
3
(LAG-3), are currently being tested in a variety of
cancers, from solid tumours to haematological
malignancies.8
9 Hundreds of trials of ICIs are
ongoing in the USA.10 Although ICI use continues
to increase, consequences of these therapies as a
result of inducing autoimmunity or through other
mechanisms are only beginning to be understood.
A
range
of
immune-related
adverse
events
(IRAEs) have been described with these agents,
ranging from severe and potentially life-threatening
pneumonitis and colitis, to autoimmune thyroid
disease, hypophysitis and vitiligo.11 Rates of events
have differed by drug and tumour type.11
12
Rheumatic and musculoskeletal IRAEs have to date
not been widely recognised or well characterised.
Recognising the potential for ICIs to cause IRAEs
that resemble more classical autoimmune diseases
will become increasingly important to rheumatolo-
gists as more patients are referred for evaluation
and management, and to oncologists who must
recognise these toxicities in order to refer.
In this article, we report a series of patients eval-
uated in the Johns Hopkins Rheumatology outpati-
ent clinics from 2012 to 2016 with inflammatory
arthritis or sicca symptoms that occurred after the
administration of ICIs. W
e report the clinical, auto-
antibody, radiological and functional features of
these patients, including the oncological and rheu-
matological treatment they received, and their clini-
cal course and outcomes.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
All patients were 18 years or older and treated for
a malignancy with ipilimumab and/or nivolumab at
the Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center at the Johns
Hopkins Medical Institutions from 2012 to 2016
for metastatic melanoma, NSCLC or RCC. Patients
were referred by oncologists when they identified
new clinically important symptoms in routine care

 of patients in practice or trials. Cases were included only if
rheumatic signs or symptoms developed after receiving therapy
with ipilimumab and/or nivolumab, in the absence of known
antecedent inflammatory arthritis or sicca syndrome. Patients
underwent a comprehensive rheumatological assessment by a
rheumatologist and were classified as having inflammatory
arthritis based on history, examination and imaging findings as
determined by the treating rheumatologist. Sicca syndrome was
defined by the presence of severe salivary hypofunction on
examination or functional assessment of salivary flow and/or
severe dry eyes as determined by an ophthalmologist.
Demographic data, other IRAE manifestations, treatment of
IRAEs and response to therapy and articular findings were
recorded by the examining rheumatologists and abstracted from
medical records. Cancer treatment responses were defined by
Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid T
umors (RECIST) 1.1 cri-
teria13 as read by a radiologist on serial CT imaging. The
reported laboratory studies are those obtained during the course
of clinical care in clinical laboratories. Any imaging studies avail-
able in the Johns Hopkins system were also included. In addi-
tion,
musculoskeletal
ultrasound
was
performed
on
select
patients by an ultrasound-certified rheumatologist.
RESULTS
Demographics and oncological history
Six patients had melanoma, five had NSCLC, one had small
cell lung carcinoma and one had RCC. The average age of
patients was 58.7 years (SD 12), and 83% were male. Eight of
13 patients received combination therapy with nivolumab
and ipilimumab; the remaining five patients received mono-
therapy with either nivolumab or ipilimumab (table 1). Seven
patients had a partial response, five patients had stable disease
and one had progressive disease (table 1). The median time to
develop the first IRAE after exposure to ICIs was 3 months
(range: 1–18 months) (table 2).
Inflammatory arthritis
Nine of the 13 patients had inflammatory arthritis. Clinical fea-
tures of their musculoskeletal manifestations are described in
table 3.
The clinical presentation was variable between patients and
involved both large and small joints in the upper and lower
extremities. The initial joints involved were large ones for some
patients, especially knees and elbows, while others had initial
involvement of the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) and proximal
interphalangeal (PIP) joints. When followed over time, six
patients evolved to develop rheumatoid arthritis (RA)-like
pattern characterised by bilateral synovitis of the PIPs, MCPs
and/or wrists, along with larger joint involvement. Five of these
patients were treated with systemic corticosteroids. Interestingly,
most of these patients had profound inflammatory disease
requiring much higher doses of corticosteroid therapy than initi-
ally anticipated based on their clinical phenotype. Also, the
inflammatory arthritis persisted in some patients for months
after ICI therapy was stopped. Patient 1 still had active inflam-
matory arthritis 6 months after his last infusion of nivolumab,
and patient 2 had active inflammatory arthritis 15 months after
her last infusion of ipilimumab and nivolumab. In these two
patients, therapy was intensified to include tumour necrosis
factor (TNF)-inhibitors, ultimately resulting in adequate control
of their arthritis.
T
wo patients had a clinical presentation similar to reactive
arthritis. One of these individuals (patient 6) had dactylitis of
one finger and large joint oligoarthritis with conjunctivitis and
urethritis. His symptoms resolved when he was treated with
infliximab and prednisone for colitis and did not recur. The
other (patient 4) had urethritis and conjunctivitis followed
closely by a predominantly large joint polyarthritis. He required
doses of corticosteroids >1 mg/kg for 2 weeks before having
any improvement in his articular manifestations. Adalimumab
was initiated with considerable improvement allowing tapering
of steroids.
One patient had a large joint polyarthritis consistent with a
seronegative spondyloarthritis (patient 7). He did not have
synovitis of the PIPs or MCPs, back pain, enthesitis or extra-
articular manifestations of reactive arthritis. He responded to
40 mg daily of prednisone therapy with symptoms recurring
when he decreased below 10 mg daily.
Imaging was conducted in four patients and confirmed the
presence of inflammatory arthritis in each. Three had abnormal
musculoskeletal ultrasound findings, and one had an abnormal
joint MRI. Ultrasound demonstrated synovitis with erosions in
the right talonavicular joint of a patient with seronegative sym-
metric polyarthritis (patient 2) similar to RA (figure 1). In
patient 1, MRI showed tibiotalar and subtalar joint effusions
(figure 2). Patient 3 had erosive arthritis and proliferative syno-
vitis of the elbow by ultrasound at the time of his initial rheu-
matological evaluation (table 2). Initial plain films were negative
for metastatic bone lesions, but he ultimately developed a meta-
static lesion in the humerus, just proximal to the elbow.
Four patients had synovial fluid analysis, each inflammatory
(synovial fluid white blood cells range 9854–28 400 cells/mm3).
All synovial fluids had a predominance of polymorphonuclear
cells (>70%). Patient 7 had synovial fluid monosodium urate
crystals, with a synovial fluid white blood cell count of
9854 cells/mm3 and a serum uric acid level of 5.7 mg/dL.
However, his presentation was thought to be more indicative of
a non-crystalline disease, given his failure to respond to colchi-
cine, his polyarticular presentation and his ongoing requirement
for high doses of corticosteroids (up to 40 mg/day prednisone).
No patients with inflammatory arthritis were positive for
rheumatoid factor (RF) or anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide
(CCP) antibodies. Three of the inflammatory arthritis patients
had antinuclear antibodies (ANA), only one with a high titre
(table 2).
Four of the nine patients with inflammatory arthritis also
developed colitis during their ICI treatment. For three patients,
the colitis preceded the arthritis, and in the fourth the colitis
developed after the arthritis. T
wo of these patients also had
reactive arthritis presentations, and one had symptoms sugges-
tive of inflammatory back pain.
Sicca syndrome
Four patients had sicca symptoms that developed while on ICIs
and could not be explained by other medications. All four pre-
sented with the relatively abrupt onset of severe dry mouth
symptoms and had examination evidence of severe salivary
hypofunction. One patient had concurrent bilateral parotid
gland swelling which resolved with steroid therapy. On ultra-
sound imaging, she also had discrete hypoechoic foci occupying
more than 50% of her parotid and submandibular glands,
changes that are commonly seen in Sjögren’s syndrome.14 One
patient had a pre-existing history of severe dry eye disease, but
no diagnosis of Sjögren’s syndrome and no severe dry mouth
symptoms. T
wo of the patients with sicca syndrome developed
other IRAEs; pneumonitis developed in one patient and intersti-
tial nephritis and colitis in the other. The pneumonitis, intersti-
tial nephritis and colitis improved with steroid treatment.

Ann Rheum Dis: first published as 10.1136/annrheumdis-2016-209595 on 15 June 2016. Downloaded from 
 Three of four sicca patients had positive ANA; one patient
had low titre La/SSB antibodies; but none of the patients had
Ro/SSA antibodies (table 2). One sicca patient had a positive RF.
One patient, who also had pneumonitis, had anti-EJ antibodies
(one of the antisynthetase antibodies). He had no associated
rash, Raynaud’s phenomenon or proximal muscle weakness.
DISCUSSION
A range of IRAEs in the setting of ICIs have been recognised
and well described, including algorithms for their manage-
ment. Less severe IRAEs, such as dermatological IRAEs, can
occur in >30% of patients who received nivolumab or pem-
brolizumab for melanoma.11 Hypothyroidism, also common,
occurs in as many as 15% of patients treated with concurrent
nivolumab and ipilimumab therapy for melanoma4 versus 6%
in those patients treated with ipilimumab alone.5 More severe
events like colitis, pneumonitis and hepatitis are less common.
In patients with melanoma treated with ipilimumab, severe
immune-related colitis has been described in approximately
5% of patients,4 5 whereas rates of colitis were only about
1% in phase III studies of nivolumab for metastatic mela-
noma2 and NSCLC.4 Combination therapy with ipilimumab
and nivolumab has shown higher rates of colitis, 11.8% in
one trial.4 Pneumonitis has been seen in 5% of patients
treated with nivolumab for squamous NSCLC,15 4% in those
treated for RCC7 and 1.5% in melanoma.16 Autoimmune
hepatitis is reported in 5%–10% of patients treated with nivo-
lumab or ipilimumab.16–19 Inflammatory conditions affecting
the skin, eye, kidney, pancreas and neurological system have
also been described.20
Inflammatory arthritis and sicca syndrome associated with ICI
use have been less commonly reported. Although arthralgia has
been noted (in 5%–16% of patients treated with nivolumab in
phase III studies for melanoma2 16 or NSCLC21 and in 11% of
those
treated
with
combination
ipilimumab/nivolumab
therapy,22 inflammatory arthritis is less commonly described.
The current literature consists of case reports or small case
series. T
wo cases of polyarticular seronegative inflammatory
arthritis developing after pembrolizumab therapy were recently
reported.23 One patient had a large joint arthritis, while the
other had both large and small (PIP) joint involvement. Both
patients lacked RF, CCP and ANA. In a retrospective review of
imaging studies using CT and positron emission tomography
(PET)/CT performed before and after treatment with anti-
CTLA-4 therapies, 4 of 119 patients had evidence of new arthri-
tis detectable on imaging.24 Limited clinical information was
reported on these patients to further characterise them.
This report provides the largest case series to date of inflam-
matory arthritis due to ICIs. This series illustrates the wide
range of clinical presentations and management required for
patients with rheumatic IRAEs. W
e describe clinically relevant
subtypes of inflammatory arthritis, which may involve both
large and small joints, and present as an oligoarthritis, an addi-
tive arthritis or with severe polyarthritis. The arthritis can be
severe and erosive, requiring multiple immunosuppressant medi-
cations, or, less frequently, can be mild with improvement on
low-dose
corticosteroids
or
non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory
drugs alone. W
e observed that the inflammatory arthritis may
also persist after ICI discontinuation. Though many patients had
symmetrical
small
joint
involvement
consistent
with
RA,
anti-CCP and
RF
were
not
seen
in
most
patients
with
ICI-induced arthritis. In addition, the dose of steroids required
to control symptoms was often higher than would be typically
adequate to manage other forms of inflammatory arthritis. The
presence of rapid erosive and destructive disease should raise
concerns of potential metastatic disease, as seen in one of the
patients reported here. The large joint involvement in most
patients,

To our knowledge, no individual cases of ICI-induced sicca
syndrome have been previously described. Dry mouth was
reported in 6.5% of patients in one phase I clinical trial of nivo-
lumab,19 but has not been reported in larger clinical trials. In
the current series, patients with sicca syndrome presented with
abrupt and severe salivary hypofunction, suggesting an immune
aetiology. The dry eye symptoms were less severe. Ro antibodies
were not observed in the four patients with sicca, and parotid
gland swelling and La antibodies were seen in one patient.
Although not reported in our series, other IRAEs with rheu-
matological manifestations have been noted including inflamma-
tory myopathy and vasculitis. One case of ipilimumab-associated
dermatomyositis
with
cutaneous
findings, proximal
muscle
weakness and elevated muscle enzymes was recently pub-
lished.26 Another case of proximal muscle and respiratory weak-
ness, with elevated muscle enzymes following treatment with
nivolumab was also reported.27 Polymyalgia rheumatica and
giant cell arteritis have been reported after treatment with ipili-
mumab in two patients.28
Many of the patients we report had more than one IRAE. In
this case series, colitis was the most common concurrent event;
pneumonitis and thyroiditis were also seen. The sequence of
IRAEs varied; some patients had arthritis or sicca first while
others had IRAEs preceding the arthritis or sicca. Also notable
was the short duration these subjects were exposed to ICIs
before developing their first IRAE. In nearly all (12 of 13 cases),
the first IRAE developed after 9 months or less of ICI therapy,
with 62% occurring within the first 3 months and 23% in the
first month following first exposure. The kinetics of the onset of
IRAEs has been described for ipilimumab, with skin typically
seen as the first manifestation, followed by colitis, and later
hepatitis and endocrinopathies.29 For the rheumatic manifesta-
tions
reported
here,
timing
of
onset
ranged
from
2
to
13 months after ICI exposure.

 The true incidence of ICI-induced inflammatory arthritis or
sicca syndrome is uncertain as it is difficult to obtain a clear
denominator of patients treated with nivolumab and ipilimumab
at our institution. The nine patients with inflammatory arthritis
seen at our centre come from a pool of both clinical trial patients
and patients receiving therapy as standard-of-care. Also, it is unli-
kely that the numerator is representative of all rheumatic IRAEs
experienced for several reasons. Patients may not have been
referred to rheumatology if they had mild symptoms, if they had
a concurrent IRAE treated with steroids by oncology, if they died
from their cancer or if they stopped their ICI for other reasons. A
rough estimate of a denominator is about 700 patients treated
with immunotherapy in trials at Johns Hopkins, which would
give an incidence of 1.3%. W
e speculate that the incidence of
these events will be similar to other previously reported IRAEs
when information on arthritis is systematically captured from the
beginning of therapy. Current clinical trial data likely underesti-
mates the incidence of inflammatory arthritis due to the numer-
ous options for coding of musculoskeletal symptoms (arthritis,
arthralgia, joint effusion) that are mutually exclusive. Prior work
has shown that the grading system employed for oncological clin-
ical trials may underestimate symptom severity and impact for
musculoskeletal and rheumatic AEs.30
Limitations of this study include the retrospective nature of the
analysis, and that patients reported here received only nivolumab
and/or ipilimumab rather than all currently approved ICIs. The
patients included had symptoms of sufficient severity to be
referred to a rheumatologist. There may be many patients with
milder symptoms of rheumatic IRAEs who were not referred.
Our sample of patients was also enriched for participants in clini-
cal trials, as Johns Hopkins is a tertiary referral centre, and nivo-
lumab has been Food and Drug Administration-approved for a
short period of time. Patients receiving ICIs outside of clinical
trials may be systematically different from those enrolled in trials,
and they may also receive different monitoring by their clinicians.
Additional cases of rheumatic IRAEs have been seen by our
group, but could not be included in this series due to clinical trial
embargoes and publication restrictions.
There are many unanswered questions in the field of IRAEs
due to ICIs. The diversity of manifestations of inflammatory
arthritis, from type of joints involved, presence or absence of
autoantibodies and presence or absence of erosive disease,
demonstrates the need for careful baseline evaluation and follow-
ing of these patients by rheumatologists. The complex pheno-
types will not be understood without carefully cataloguing these
patients. In addition, more work is needed to establish the inci-
dence of rheumatic IRAEs. The denominator of patients treated
with ICIs should be carefully evaluated so that the frequency of
rheumatic manifestations can be understood and the risk of these
events can be appropriately presented to patients. Finally, the
rheumatologist’s decisions on treatment for rheumatic IRAEs
should be decided in conjunction with treating oncologists. It is
unclear which disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs are safest
or most effective in these patients. Given the grave prognosis of
metastatic cancer, there is a higher acceptance of risk in treating
IRAEs, with the goal of continuing ICI therapy. An example is
the common use of TNF antagonists to treat the colitis associated
with ICI therapy.31 The optimum dosage of corticosteroids is
also uncertain as some patients in our series required doses as
high of 120 mg of prednisone daily for relief of their symptoms,
while others could be maintained on a much lower dose after an
initial high dose. Collaboration between rheumatologists and
oncologists will be instrumental to understand the spectrum of
rheumatological IRAEs and their treatment.
