Summary
Chronic jet lag induces spontaneous hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in wild-type mice following 
a mechanism very similar to that observed in obese humans. The process initiates with non-
alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) that progresses to steatohepatitis and fibrosis before HCC 
detection. This pathophysiological pathway is driven by jet lag induced genome-wide gene 
deregulation and global liver metabolic dysfunction, with nuclear receptor-controlled cholesterol/
bile acid and xenobiotic metabolism among the top deregulated pathways. Ablation of farnesoid X 
receptor (FXR) dramatically increases enterohepatic bile acid levels and jet lag-induced HCC, 
while loss of constitutive androstane receptor (CAR), a well-known liver tumor promoter that 
mediates toxic bile acid signaling, inhibits NAFLD-induced hepatocarcinogenesis. Circadian 
disruption activates CAR by promoting cholestasis, peripheral clock disruption, and sympathetic 
dysfunction.

 Graphical abstract
Kettner et al. show that experimental chronic jet lag induces persistent deregulation of liver gene 
expression and metabolism, culminating in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma. The bile 
acid receptor FXR and xenobiotic receptor CAR play an important role in this process.
Introduction
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common liver malignancy, was previously 
considered a rare cancer in the U.S., but a nearly 3-fold increase in incidence since the 1980s 
has made it the fastest rising cause of cancer-related death (El-Serag, 2011). Unlike in 
developing countries where hepatitis viral infection and aflatoxin contamination are major 
HCC risk factors, up to 30–50% of HCC diagnosed in the U.S. is resulted from liver 
metabolic diseases. Among these diseases, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is 
predicted to become the leading cause of HCC in the 21st century as a secondary 
consequence of the obesity pandemic (Siegel and Zhu, 2009).
NAFLD is found in 30–40% of the general population and up to 95% of those with morbid 
obesity (Review et al., 2014). Excessive fat accumulation induces liver injury, inflammation 
and regeneration, which progresses to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) in a fraction of 
patients. This further stimulates the formation of scar tissue (fibrosis) and cirrhosis, both of 
which predispose to HCC (Michelotti et al., 2013). Although severe NAFLD can lead to 
hepatocarcinogenesis without NASH and fibrosis (Guzman et al., 2008), NASH and 
advanced fibrosis increase HCC risk by 15 and 25 folds in humans, respectively (Guzman et 
al., 2008; Hashimoto et al., 2009). The co-existence of NASH with other metabolic disorders 
such as leptin resistance and cholestasis significantly accelerates liver fibrosis (Wang et al., 
2010).

 Like HCC caused by other risk factors, NAFLD-induced HCC is predominantly diagnosed 
in males, but at older ages and earlier disease stages (Hashimoto et al., 2009). However, no 
significant difference in overall 5-year survival is found among HCC patients with or 
without NAFLD-related etiologies (Tokushige et al., 2011). The lack of proper mouse 
models that develop NAFLD in response to chronic metabolic stress and progress to 
NAFLD-initiated liver injury, inflammation, fibrosis and HCC as observed in obese human 
subjects has significantly impaired the study on the mechanism of metabolic syndrome-
induced hepatocarcinogenesis (Michelotti et al., 2013). Despite the impending burden of 
NAFLD-induced HCC, no oncogene addiction loops specific to this disease have been 
identified (Villanueva et al., 2013).
The prevalence of obesity and NAFLD in our society is coupled with the epidemic of 
chronic circadian disruption, also termed “social jet lag” (Roenneberg et al., 2012). 
Circadian dysfunction among night-shift workers and individuals suffering from sleep 
dyspnea has been identified as a common risk factor of obesity, metabolic disorders, 
NAFLD and cancer including HCC (Bass and Takahashi, 2010; Fu and Kettner, 2013; Hu et 
al., 2013; Kao et al., 2012; Kim et al., 2013; Zimberg et al., 2012).
Circadian homeostasis in mammals is maintained by a central clock located in the 
hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus that constantly synchronizes to external solar light 
cues and controls subordinate clocks in peripheral tissues via circadian output pathways. 
Among these pathways, the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) targets peripheral organs via 
adrenergic receptor-mediated intracellular signaling (Furness, 2006). SNS dysfunction is 
closely associated with metabolic syndrome, oncogenic activation, neoplastic growth and 
tumor initiation (Lee et al., 2010; Magnon et al., 2013; Tentolouris et al., 2006). The clock is 
operated by circadian genes. The current model of the molecular clock is based on the cyclic 
expression of the bHLH-PAS transcription factors BMAL1 and CLOCK and their 
downstream targets Cryptochrome (Cry1 and Cry2) and Period (Per1, Per2 and Per3), which 
encode the repressors of BMAL1/CLOCK heterodimer. The molecular clock also targets 
clock-controlled genes (CCGs) to couple diverse functions of peripheral organs with daily 
physical activity (Mohawk et al., 2012). Recent studies have revealed that germline or 
tissue-specific ablation of core circadian genes promotes genomic instability and accelerates 
both tumorigenesis and cancer progression in mice (Kettner et al., 2014)
The liver is the focus of circadian regulation of metabolic pathways, especially those 
controlling the synthesis and metabolism of glucose, lipid, cholesterol and bile acid (Bass 
and Takahashi, 2010). We have previously reported that mutations in both Per1 and Per2 or 
phase-shifts of the liver clock by restricted feeding both promote uncontrolled intrahepatic 
bile acid accumulation (cholestasis) and disrupt xenobiotic metabolism in mice (Ma et al., 
2009), and that HCC is the second most commonly observed malignancy in circadian gene-
mutant mouse models (Lee et al., 2010).
Bile acids are synthesized from cholesterol in the liver and function to promote dietary fat 
and lipid absorption. As detergents, bile acid intrahepatic levels are tightly controlled by a 
classic endocrine negative feedback loop in which bile acids act as ligands for the farnesoid 
X receptor (FXR, NR1H4), which then indirectly suppresses Cyp7A1, the rate limiting

 enzyme in bile acid biosynthesis (Goodwin et al., 2000). FXR also plays a broad role in liver 
function by inhibiting steatosis and inflammatory genes (Lopez-Velazquez et al., 2012). 
Ablation of Nr1h4 (hereafter referred to as Fxr) not only promotes cholestasis but also 
NAFLD, NASH and HCC in mice (Kim et al., 2007; Lu et al., 2000; Wang et al., 2008; 
Watanabe et al., 2004; Yang et al., 2007).
Intrahepatic cholestasis can also activate the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR, NR1I3) 
(Guo et al., 2003; Huang et al., 2005; Ma et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2004), a central regulator 
of xenobiotic metabolism. CAR activation is the basis for phenobarbital promoted non-
genotoxic or mutagen-induced hepatocarcinogenesis in mice (Huang et al., 2005; Yamamoto 
et al., 2004), which is strongly linked to β-catenin activation or mutation (Loeppen et al., 
2002), a common molecular lesion in human HCC (Zucman-Rossi et al., 2015). We have 
recently shown that combined pharmacologic activation of CAR and genetic activation of β-
catenin in mice is sufficient to induce liver tumors that share an extensive gene expression 
signature with a subset of human HCC displaying β-catenin activation (Dong et al., 2015).
Based on the discoveries described above, we hypothesize that chronic circadian disruption 
is sufficent to induce spontaneous hepatocarcinogenesis by driving persistant liver metabilic 
dysfunction and oncogenic activation.
Results
Circadian dysfunction induces NAFLD prior to spontaneous hepatocarcinogenesis
We have reported recently that chronic circadian disruption is sufficient to induce Leptin 
resistance in mice independent of diet choice and the time or amount of food intake (Kettner 
et al., 2015). We further studied the role of prolonged circadian disruption in HCC risk by 
conducting a large scale survival study with C57BL/6J inbred WT and congenic mice 
lacking Per1 and Per2 (Per1−/−;Per2−/−), Cry1 and Cry2 (Cry1−/−;Cry2−/−), or Bmal1 in the 
liver (Albcre;Bmal1fl/fl), under entrained or chronic jet-lagged conditions from 4 to 90 weeks 
of age. Compared to control littermates maintained in steady 24 hour light/dark (24 hr LD) 
cycles, jet-lagged mice showed significantly reduced lifespan with disease development 
leading to early euthanization (Figure 1A), which include neurodegeneration, severe 
ulcerative dermatitis, aging, cystic renal dysplasia, and cancer (Table 1).
The major cancer types diagnosed in mutant and jet-lagged mice include pancreatic and 
ovarian tumors, B-lymphoma and HCC (Figures 1B and S1A), with lymphoma and HCC as 
the leading cause of cancer-related early euthanization. Unlike γ-irradiated mice that are 
especially susceptible to lymphoma (Fu et al., 2002; Lee et al., 2010), unirradiated jet-
lagged WT and mutant mice displayed similar risk of lymphoma and HCC regardless of the 
differences in the molecular signatures of liver clock disruption in these mice, with HCC 
incidence specific to each mouse model by 90 weeks of age (Figures 1C, 1D and Table 1). 
Both sexes of mutant mice displayed increased risk of hepatocarcinogenesis, with males 
showed greater HCC risk than females. Under entrained condition, Per- or Cry-mutants 
developed fewer but larger HCCs first detected at 50 weeks of age, while Albcre;Bmal1fl/fl 
mice developed a large number but small HCCs first detected after 70 weeks of age. Chronic 
jet lag increased both numbers and sizes of tumors in Per and Cry mutants and also the size

 of tumor in HCC bearing Albcre;Bmal1fl/fl mice (Figures 1B, S1A–B and Table 1). Thus, 
chronic circadian disruption not only increases tumor incidence but also accelerates tumor 
progression.
Despite the fact that C57BL/6J inbred WT mice are normally resistant to spontaneous and 
carcinogen-induced HCC (Diwan et al., 1990; Drinkwater and Ginsler, 1986), chronically 
jetlagged WT mice developed HCC after 78 weeks of age. This was also male dominant and 
at an age correspondent to the median age of spontaneous HCC diagnosis at 67–72 years in 
humans (Hashimoto et al., 2009; Kunstyr and Leuenberger, 1975; Yasui et al., 2011) 
(Figures 1B, S1A–B and Table 1).
Liver pathology in jet-lagged WT and mutant mice, including Cry-mutants that are deficient 
in fat storage in adipose (Kettner et al., 2015), initiated with spontaneous NAFLD onset at a 
young age. Jet lag also accelerated NAFLD progression in Albcre;Bmal1fl/fl mice (Figures 
1E–G and S1C). Together, these findings demonstrates that chronic circadian misalignment 
is sufficient to disrupt liver clock and induce NAFLD-related HCC in WT mice. 
Since ”social jet lag”, but not circadian gene germline or tissue-specific ablation, is the 
major type of circadian disruption in humans (Roenneberg, 2013), we then focused on 
studying the mechanism of NAFLD-induced HCC using jet-lagged WT mice, with 
Albcre;Bmal1fl/fl and Per1−/−;Per2−/− mice that display two distinct patterns of liver clock 
disruption and are easier to breed as controls to confirm the role of the clock in the 
pathologies observed (Figures 1C and 1D).
Circadian dysfunction induces metabolic syndrome and NAFLD to NASH and fibrosis 
progression
In addition to developing leptin resistance (Kettner et al., 2015), jet-lagged WT mice also 
displayed a decrease in serum triglycerides and free fatty acids coupled with an increase in 
hepatic level of triglycerides and free fatty acids. This was associated with persistent high 
plasma levels of glucose and insulin, characteristic of insulin resistance (Figure 2A), and a 
dramatic decrease in hepatic glycogen storage throughout a 24 hr period (Figures 2B and 
S2).
The development of metabolic syndrome in jet-lagged WT mice is coupled with persistent 
liver damage as indicated by elevated and deregulated plasma liver parameters, such as 
alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase 
(ALP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and total bilirubin (Figures 2A and 2C). This is 
accompanied by hepatomegaly (Figure 2D), increased bile duct proliferation and chronic 
liver inflammation (Figure 2E), accelerated hepatocyte proliferation and death, and the 
appearance of fibrosis long before HCC detection (Figure 2F). Thus, chronic circadian 
disruption not only induces NAFLD but also persistent liver damage and fibrosis long before 
spontaneous hepatocarcinogenesis. Per1−/−;Per2−/− and Albcre;Bmal1fl/fl mice also displayed 
similar deregulation of serum and hepatic metabolic parameters and liver pathological 
changes in addition to NAFLD prior to HCC detection (Figure S3).

 Circadian disruption induces global metabolic disruption in the liver
To study the mechanism of circadian disruption-induced NAFLD, we conducted a large 
scale circadian metabolomics study on serum and hepatic carnitines, lipids and 
prostaglandins, CoA’s, and tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) metabolites in WT mice at 12 
and 30 weeks of age. The majority of metabolites studied displayed robust circadian rhythms 
in control WT mice, but were deregulated in jet-lagged WT mice. Especially, jet-lagged WT 
mice displayed increased serum and hepatic levels of lactate and pyruvate, coupled with 
elevated levels of essential bioprecursors for amino acids, nucleotides, triglyceride and 
cholesterol synthesis, such as α-ketoglutarate, glycerol 3 phosphate, glutamine, ribose 5 
phosphate, acetyl CoA, malate and fumarate, etc. These were associated with deregulation of 
fatty acid transporting carnitines and accumulation of TCA cycle intermediates, such as 
isocitrate, succinate, fumarate and malate, an indication of mitochondrial electron transport 
chain disruption and redox deregulation (Figures 3 and S4–5).
Thus, chronic jet lag induces a global shift in liver metabolism to promote lipid synthesis 
and storage via accelerating cytoplasmic glycolysis. This is also coupled with elevated 
intracellular oxidative stress that induces liver damage and increased biosynthetic 
intermediates that support rapid cell division (Figures 1E–F, 2A–B, S1C, S2 and S4–5), a 
pattern of metabolic adaptation closely reminiscent of that well-characterized for most types 
of cancer cells (Warburg, 1956).
Jet lag induces genome-wide gene deregulation with hepatic cholesterol, bile acid and 
xenobiotic metabolism as top deregulated pathways
To define the mechanism of jet lag induced global disruption of liver metabolism and 
pathology, we carried out a large scale microarray analysis using total liver RNA prepared 
from 12 and 30 week old control and jet-lagged WT mice at ZT2, 10 and 18. As expected, 
chronic jet lag induced persistent and genome-wide gene deregulation in mouse livers 
(Figure 4A and Table S1–2). This includes overexpression of genes promoting lipid, amino 
acids and nucleotides biosynthesis and storage, cytoplasmic glycolysis, glycogenolysis, 
oxidative stress, hepatocyte proliferation and death, cholestasis, and fibrosis, suppression of 
genes stimulating fatty acid mitochondria transportation and β-oxidation, glycogen 
synthesis, and tumor suppression, and deregulation of genes controlling cell cycle 
checkpoints, DNA damage repair, and both innate and adaptive inflammatory responses 
(Table S3).
Importantly, the jet lag induced gene deregulation signature significantly overlaps with that 
found in human HCC (Figure 4B), and also includes pathways frequently deregulated in 
other human cancers, such as pancreatic adenocarcinoma and bladder, small cell lung, 
prostate, and estrogen-dependent and hereditary breast cancers (Table S4–5) (Hoshida et al., 
2008; Huang et al., 2011; Huang et al., 2012; Lee et al., 2006; Woo et al., 2008; Ye et al., 
2003; Zucman-Rossi et al., 2015).
The deregulation of key genes, including circadian genes Bmal1, Clock, Per1, Per2, Cry1 
and Nr1d1 (encoding REV-ERBα), was validated at the mRNA level by RT-PCR (Figure 
4C). Together with the results of protein expression studies shown in figure1C and 1D, these

 results demonstrated that chronic jet lag is sufficient to disrupt the liver clock independent of 
circadian gene mutations. Surprisingly, in the livers of Albcre;Bmal1fl/fl mice, Per2 mRNA 
still displayed a shifted and dampened circadian expression profile, while Cry1 mRNA was 
constitutively overexpressed. These findings were consistent with a previous report on Cry1 
mRNA hepatic overexpression in Albcre;Bmal1fl/fl mice (Lamia et al., 2008), and with our 
finding that the negative loop proteins PER2 and CRY1 still display a robust circadian 
expression in the livers of these mice under entrained condition (Figures 1C–D and 4C).
Dysregulation of homologs of molecular markers of human HCCs, such as Ctnnb1 
(encoding β-catenin), Myc and Trp53 (Zucman-Rossi et al., 2015), was also found at the 
mRNA and/or protein levels in the livers of jet-lagged WT and circadian gene-mutant mice 
(Figures 4C–D and S6A–B). However, unlike in mouse thymus where circadian disruption is 
sufficient to suppress p53 (Lee et al., 2010), chronic jet lag induced a coupled activation of 
p53 and c-Myc in the livers of WT mice at a young age. Thus, the p53 response to Myc 
oncogenic activation was still intact in the liver at the initial stage of circadian disruption 
(Figure 4D). This finding agrees with previous reports that the complete loss of p53 function 
is associated with the progression but not initiation of hepatitis B virus or aflatoxin B1-
induced HCC in humans (Hosono et al., 1993; Nose et al., 1993).
Strikingly, nuclear receptor-controlled cholesterol, bile acid and xenobiotic metabolism were 
among the top deregulated pathways in the livers of jet-lagged WT mice at all ages studied 
(Table S6). Among these nuclear receptors, the suppression of FXR and induction of CAR, 
as reported for human HCC (Hoshida et al., 2008; Lee et al., 2006), were found in jet-lagged 
WT and circadian gene mutant mice, coupled with upregulation of transcription factors 
stimulating cell proliferation and steatosis such as β-catenin, c-Myc, SREBP1 and PPARγ 
(encoded by the Nr1c3), as well as Cyp2B10, a direct target of CAR activation, and 
Cyp7A1, the rate limiting enzyme for bile acid synthesis negatively regulated by FXR 
(Figures 4D–F and S6A–D).
Further analysis revealed that all HCC-prone mouse models in our study displayed 
significantly elevated serum and hepatic bile acid levels, characteristic of intrahepatic 
cholestasis, regardless of their molecular mechanisms of liver clock disruption and overall 
metabolic phenotypes (Figures 1C–D, 4G and S6E). Thus, the coexistence of intrahepatic 
cholestasis with NAFLD may play a key role in spontaneous hepatocarcinogenesis.
CAR is a CCG that promotes spontaneous HCC by stimulating NAFLD to NASH transition
We and others have previously demonstrated that elevated bile acids, as observed in mice 
lacking circadian homeostasis, activates CAR (Guo et al., 2003; Huang et al., 2005; Ma et 
al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2004), which promotes hepatocarcinogenesis independent of 
exogenous mutagens (Huang et al., 2005; Yamamoto et al., 2004). To define the role of 
cholestasis and CAR in NAFLD-induced HCC, we studied HCC risk in Fxr−/− and Nr1i3−/− 
(here after Car−/−) C57BL/6J mice. Under entrained conditions, Fxr−/− mice displayed the 
highest levels of intrahepatic bile acids and triglycerides throughout a 24 hr period among all 
mouse models studied, and also the highest risk of NAFLD and HCC, as expected. Chronic 
jet lag further accelerated NAFLD development and led to a greater than 2-fold increase in 
HCC incidence in Fxr−/− mice by 90 weeks of age (Figure 5A and Table 1). In contrast,

 although Car−/− mice were also prone to NAFLD and circadian disruption-induced 
cholestasis and glycogen storage disease, they showed a dramatically decreased risk of jet 
lag induced hepatomegaly, inflammation, hepatocyte proliferation and necrosis, fibrosis, and 
were completely resistant to spontaneous HCC (Figures 5, S7 and Table 1).
Under entrained conditions, Car−/− mice had an intact liver clock and maintained a circadian 
profile of FXR and Cyp7A1 expression (Figures 6A–B). However, they lacked β-catenin 
nuclear activation and showed dramatically dampened c-Myc and Cyp2B10 protein 
expression in the liver (Figures 6B–D). CAR mRNA and protein levels also displayed a 
robust circadian rhythm in 24 hr LD cycles, but were arrhythmic and elevated at most times 
in the livers of jet-lagged WT mice, coupled with constitutive overexpression of Cyp2b10 
mRNA, a direct consequence of CAR-directed transcriptional activation (Figure 6E). 
Chronic jet lag disrupted the liver clock in both Car−/− and WT mice but failed to fully 
activate oncogenic, steatotic and inflammatory genes in Car−/− mice as compared to jet-
lagged WT controls. This, again, was coupled with the lack of direct CAR target Cyp2b10 
mRNA expression in jet-lagged Car mutants, which confirmed the ability of jet lag to 
activate CAR (Figures 6A and 6E). Thus, Car is a CCG. Its circadian dysregulation 
stimulates the pathophysiological progression from NAFLD to HCC.
Sympathetic dysfunction promotes CAR constitutive overexpression
Previous studies have suggested that BMAL1/CLOCK and the PAR-domain basic leucine 
zipper transcription factor DBP may co-activate Car over a 24 hr period in the liver (Gachon 
et al., 2006; Koike et al., 2012; Ripperger and Schibler, 2006). However, Bmal1 and Dbp 
were both suppressed by circadian disruption (Figures 1C–D and 4C). Thus, jet lag induced 
CAR overexpression in WT mice appeared to be controlled by a previously unknown 
mechanism. We found that apart from multiple D- and E-boxes potentially recognized by 
DBP and BMAL1/CLOCK, human and mouse CAR promoters contain conserved AP1 and 
CRE motifs potentially activated by SNS signaling (Figures 7A). In vitro transfection assays 
showed that the Car promoter was moderately stimulated by low levels but suppressed by 
higher levels of AP1 or CREB expression. However, co-expression of AP1 and CREB, even 
at a moderate level, dramatically stimulated Car promoter activity (Figures 7B). We also 
found that chronic jet lag significantly increased SNS tone in the sleep phase. This was 
coupled with a constitutive AP1 and Ser133 phospho-CREB (pCREB) nuclear accumulation 
in mouse livers, which is a well-known consequence of cellular response to SNS-ADRβ-c-
AMP-PKA signaling (Figures 7C–E). Ablation of all three β-adrenergic receptors in mice 
(β-less) completely inhibited AP1 and pCREB nuclear accumulation and also Car, Fos, Myc 
and Cyp2b10 expression in mouse livers under both entrained and jet lag conditions (Figures 
7F–G), which was associated with strong HCC resistance (Figure S8A). Thus, jet lag 
induced SNS dysfunction may directly deregulate Car expression via activation of AP1 and 
CREB.
To test this hypothesis, we performed in vivo ChIP using anti-BMAL1, c-FOS and pCREB 
antibodies (Figures S8B–D), primers flanking the AP1, CRE, or E-box 8 sequences in the 
Car promoter, E-box 3, AP1 or CRE motifs in the Per1 promoter, and liver nuclear extracts 
from 12 week old WT, Albcre;Bmal1fl/fl and β-less mice at ZT2, 6 and 18. In the livers of 
Kettner et al.

 WT mice, BMAL1/CLOCK transcriptional activity is low at ZT2 and 18 but peaks at ZT6 
(Koike et al., 2012), while nuclear accumulation of AP1 and pCREB is lowest at ZT6, 
slightly elevated at ZT2 and peaks ZT18 (Figures 7D–E). Thus, ZT2, 6 and 18 are the best 
times in a circadian cycle to study the interplay between SNS-controlled cell signaling and 
the liver clock in controlling Car expression.
We found that under entrained conditions, pCREB and BMAL1 displayed a coupled and 
robust rhythmic interaction with both Car and Per1 promoters, which peaked at ZT2 for 
pCREB and ZT6 for BMAL1. Although c-FOS binding to the Per1 promoter displayed a 
strong circadian rhythm and peaked at ZT2, its binding to Car promoter was constitutively 
low. Chronic jet lag abolished BMAL1 binding to both Car and Per1 promoters, significantly 
dampened c-FOS and pCREB interaction with the Per1 promoter, but induced a coupled and 
dramatically increased binding of c-FOS and pCREB to the Car promoter at all times 
studied (Figure 7H), which, as shown by promoter functional analysis, strongly activated 
Car transcription (Figure 7B). As expected, the binding of BMAL1 or c-FOS and pCREB to 
Per1 and Car promoters was not detected in livers of Albcre;Bmal1fl/fl or β-less mice, 
respectively (Figure 7H). Thus, jet lag induced SNS dysfunction and liver clock disruption 
are sufficient to promote Car dysregulation.
Discussion
Lifestyle changes, but not germline mutations, drive increased cancer risk in modern 
societies (Anand et al., 2008). One of the major lifestyle changes is chronic social jet lag 
(Roenneberg, 2013). Human epidemiological studies have revealed a strong link between 
chronic circadian disruption and cancer risk. However, the diversity of lifestyles, 
heterogeneity of cancer etiologies and long latency of spontaneous cancer development 
impose significant difficulties for defining the role of circadian dysfunction in human cancer 
initiation. Although mouse models with germline or tissue-specific ablation of circadian 
genes display increased risk of genomic instability, neoplastic growth and cancer (Kettner et 
al., 2014), the role of circadian dysfunction in spontaneous cancer initiation in humans 
cannot be closely modeled by these mutant mice as they do not display the same circadian 
dynamics as normal human individuals in response to changes in environmental cues 
(Kettner et al., 2015).
We have previously reported that chronic jet lag significantly increases the risk of γ-
radiation induced cancer in mice (Lee et al., 2010). In this study, we show that chronic 
circadian misalignment is sufficient to induce spontaneous hepatocarcinogenesis in mice in 
the absence of dietary manipulation, exogenous genotoxic stress or germline gene mutations. 
We found that in addition to leptin resistance, circadian dysfunction also induces 
hyperinsulinemia, hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia at the organismal level and liver 
metabolic disorders including NAFLD. Such combined systemic and liver metabolic 
disorders are also frequently observed among human night-shift workers (Zimberg et al., 
2012). We show that jet lag induces a global shift in liver metabolism in mice, which not 
only promotes fat synthesis and storage via accelerated cytoplasmic glycolysis but also 
increases oxidative stress and the synthesis of bioprecursors supporting rapid cell division. 
The majority of jet-lagged WT mice display NAFLD progression to NASH and then fibrosis

 at a relatively young age. This is likely due to jet lag induced persistent liver injury and 
inflammation that triggers a chronic regenerative wound-healing process, a common 
mechanism of tumor initiation (Michelotti et al., 2013). Overall, this pathophysiological 
progression closely mimics that described for NAFLD-induced spontaneous 
hepatocarcinogenesis in humans.
The complex liver pathology in jet-lagged WT mice is driven by global hepatic gene 
deregulation, which can be detected soon after the initiation of jet lag and displays a pattern 
overlapping significantly with a human HCC transcriptomic signature, including the 
induction of key human HCC molecular markers such as Trp53, Myc and β-catenin. Thus, 
jet-lagged WT mice likely also develop spontaneous HCC following a molecular mechanism 
very similar to that in obese humans.
We found that nuclear receptor-controlled cholesterol, bile acid and xenobiotic metabolism 
are among top deregulated hepatic pathways in jet-lagged WT mice, and all mouse models 
studied here displayed cholestasis in addition to NAFLD prior to HCC detection. Especially, 
HCC prone Fxr−/− mice that display extremely high intrahepatic bile acid levels showed an 
additional more than 2-fold increase in HCC incidence under jet lag condition. Thus, we 
suggest that loss of bile acid homeostasis is a direct cause of increased HCC risk in response 
to persistent circadian disruption.
Two broad mechanisms could link cholestasis to hepatocarcinogenesis. First, as strong 
hydrophobic detergents, bile acids can induce hepatocyte injury, mitochondrial damage, 
oxidative stress, DNA damage, and hepatocyte necrosis and apoptosis, all of which drive the 
progression of NAFLD to NASH, fibrosis and HCC (Audard et al., 2007; Perez and Briz, 
2009). Second, and more directly, elevated hepatic bile acid levels, together with an increase 
in hepatic toxic bile acid species due to microbiota activity associated with circadian 
disruption (Voigt et al., 2014), activate CAR, which is well known as a potent tumor 
promoter that drives non-genotoxic hepatocarcinogenesis (Guo et al., 2003; Huang et al., 
2005; Yamamoto et al., 2004; Zhang et al., 2004).
The tumor promoting function of CAR is tightly associated with β-catenin activation or 
mutation (Dong et al., 2015; Loeppen et al., 2002). Jet lag activated CAR, as measured by 
constitutive overexpression of the CAR target gene Cyp2b10 over a 24 hr period, was 
coupled with β-catenin and c-Myc overexpression. Ablation of Car completely inhibited 
nuclear β-catenin expression and suppressed jet lag induced activation of oncogenic, 
steatotic and inflammatory genes, leading to strong HCC resistance.
In the hierarchical circadian system, peripheral organs rely on signaling from circadian 
output pathways to maintain synchrony with the central clock. We found that chronic jet lag 
promotes sympathetic dysfunction and peripheral clock disruption, both of which have been 
linked to oncogenic activation and increased risk of cancer (Kettner NM, 2016; Lee et al., 
2010; Magnon et al., 2013). We demonstrated that jet lag induced sympathetic dysfunction 
and peripheral clock suppression are sufficient to promote AP1 and CREB oncogenic 
activation independent of somatic mutations, which drives Car overexpression throughout a 
24 hr period to mediate persistent toxic bile acid signaling in jet-lagged WT mice.

 We propose that chronic circadian disruption induces neuroendocrine dysfunction, leading to 
a coupled peripheral clock disruption, genome-wide gene deregulation, oncogenic activation 
and global metabolic dysfunction in the liver. Together, these induce NAFLD and also the 
progression from NAFLD to HCC. Among top deregulated gene pathways, the nuclear 
receptor CAR is constitutively activated by a combination of overexpression, in response to 
SNS dysfunction and peripheral clock disruption, and transactivation, in response to elevated 
intrahepatic bile acids, to promote spontaneous hepatocarcinogenesis by stimulating the 
progression from NALFD to NASH and fibrosis (Figure 7I). Inverse agonists to suppress 
human CAR and agonists for activation of human FXR are both pharmaceutically available 
(Hirschfield et al., 2015; Huang et al., 2004). Since ablation of CAR prevents spontaneous 
HCC and loss of FXR increases intrahepatic bile acid levels and stimulates 
hepatocarcinogenesis, our studies suggest that restoration of bile acid homeostasis and 
inhibition of CAR activation provide promising complementary strategies for prevention of 
metabolic syndrome-induced HCC.

 Significance
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is predicted to become the leading cause of 
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) due to the prevalence of obesity and chronic circadian 
disruption, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. We found that 
circadian dysfunction promotes NAFLD-induced hepatocarcinogenesis by maintaining 
persistent liver gene deregulation and metabolic disruption, closely mimicking that 
observed in obese humans. We demonstrate that the profound circadian dysregulation of 
nuclear receptor-controlled hepatoprotective pathways, especially those controlled by the 
bile acid receptor FXR and xenobiotic receptor CAR, plays an essential role in NAFLD-
induced HCC. Thus, circadian dysfunction is an independent risk factor of HCC, and 
restoration of bile acid homeostasis and inhibition of CAR are promising complementary 
strategies for prevention of metabolic syndrome-induced HCC.
