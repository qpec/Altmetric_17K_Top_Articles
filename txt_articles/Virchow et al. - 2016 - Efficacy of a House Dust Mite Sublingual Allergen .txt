IMPORTANCE The house dust mite (HDM) sublingual allergen immunotherapy (SLIT) tablet is
a potential novel treatment option for HDM allergy–related asthma.
OBJECTIVES To evaluate the efficacy and adverse events of the HDM SLIT tablet vs placebo
for asthma exacerbations during an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) reduction period.
DESIGN, SETTINGS, AND PARTICIPANTS Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial
conducted between August 2011 and April 2013 in 109 European trial sites. The trial included
834 adults with HDM allergy–related asthma not well controlled by ICS or combination
products, and with HDM allergy–related rhinitis. Key exclusion criteria were FEV1 less than
70% of predicted value or hospitalization due to asthma within 3 months before
randomization. Efficacy was assessed during the last 6 months of the trial when ICS was
reduced by 50% for 3 months and then completely withdrawn for 3 months.
INTERVENTIONS 1:1:1 randomization to once-daily treatment with placebo (n = 277) or HDM
SLIT tablet (dosage groups: 6 SQ-HDM [n = 275] or 12 SQ-HDM [n = 282]) in addition to ICS
and the short-acting β2-agonist salbutamol.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Primary outcome was time to first moderate or severe
asthma exacerbation during the ICS reduction period. Secondary outcomes were
deterioration in asthma symptoms, change in allergen-specific immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4),
change in asthma control or asthma quality-of-life questionnaires, and adverse events.

CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among adults with HDM allergy–related asthma not well
controlled by ICS, the addition of HDM SLIT to maintenance medications improved time to
first moderate or severe asthma exacerbation during ICS reduction, with an estimated
absolute reduction at 6 months of 9 to 10 percentage points; the reduction was primarily due
to an effect on moderate exacerbations. Treatment-related adverse events were common at
both active doses. Further studies are needed to assess long-term efficacy and safety.

ronchial asthma is a serious global health problem with
increasing prevalence in many countries.1 House dust
mite (HDM) sensitization is present in up to 50% of pa-
tients with asthma,2 and exposure to HDM allergen has been
related to asthma severity.3
Persistent symptoms are common in many patients with
HDM allergic disease.4 Treatment options include inhaled cor-
ticosteroids (ICS) and long-acting β-agonists, but up to 30% of
patients remain symptomatic, uncontrolled, or both despite
treatment.5 Uncontrolled
asthma is identified as a
major risk factor for fu-
ture exacerbations and
poorerclinicaloutcomes.6
Allergen immuno-
therapy is the only treat-
ment option for allergic
disease with evidence of
a disease-modifying effect7 and thus a potential for sus-
tained benefits when therapy is terminated.
Allergen immunotherapy has been shown to be effective
in the treatment of allergic rhinitis due to airborne allergens,
including HDM allergen.8,9 Allergen immunotherapy im-
proves symptoms and reduces medication scores both dur-
ing treatment and following treatment cessation7,10 and has
been shown to prevent the development of asthma.11
Previously, the HDM sublingual allergen immuno-
therapy (SLIT) tablet has proven to be effective in reducing the
requirement for ICS12,13 and in reducing allergic rhinitis symp-
tomsandneedforpharmacotherapy9,14,15amongpatientswith
HDM respiratory allergic disease. However, to our knowl-
edge, the effect on risk of asthma exacerbations has not been
addressed previously.
This trial investigated the efficacy of the HDM SLIT tablet
among participants with HDM allergy–related asthma, not well
controlled by ICS, and with HDM allergy–related rhinitis. The
primary objective of the trial was to evaluate the efficacy of
the HDM SLIT tablet in 2 different doses (6 SQ-HDM and 12 SQ-
HDM) vs placebo, measured by reducing the risk for an asthma
exacerbation during a 6-month ICS reduction period.
Methods
The trial protocol (Supplement 1) and amendments were ap-
proved by the relevant ethics committees and institutional re-
view boards. The trial was a randomized, double-blind, par-
allel group, placebo-controlled trial, designed and conducted
in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki
(adopted in 1964, and its amendments and subsequent
clarifications16) and in compliance with the International Con-
ference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for the
Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use’s (ICH’s) Good
Clinical Practice guidelines.17 Written informed consent was
obtained from all participants.
The HDM SLIT tablet contains extract from 2 species
of cultivated HDM (Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus and
Dermatophagoides farinae), produced in a standardized pro-
cess with a 1:1:1:1 ratio of the major allergens (Group 1 aller-
gens of D farinae and D pteronyssinus and Group 2 allergens
of D farinae and D pteronyssinus), and formulated as a rapidly
dissolving oral lyophilisate for sublingual administration
(ALK). The biological activity of the HDM SLIT tablet is
related to the activity of the allergens and is expressed in the
unit SQ-HDM. The placebo and active products were similar
in appearance, smell, and taste. One tablet per day was to be
placed under the tongue, preferably in the morning. Eating
and drinking was not allowed for 5 minutes. The maximum
duration of treatment with the SLIT tablet was 18 months.
Randomization was performed in blocks of 6 by the spon-
sor using the SAS system for Windows (SAS Institute), ver-
sion 9.3, which generates random assignment of treatment
groups to randomization numbers. Further details are pro-
vided in Supplement 2.
The trial was conducted at 109 sites in 13 European
countries from August 11, 2011, through April 24, 2013. The
participants were randomized (1:1:1) to receive placebo,
the 6 SQ-HDM tablets, or the 12 SQ-HDM tablets, as add-on
therapy to ICS and short-acting β2-agonists (SABA). Eligible
patients were adults with a positive result for the HDM-
specific serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) and skin prick test; a
clinical history of more than 1 year of allergic asthma and
allergic rhinitis with HDM being considered clinically as a
major trigger, not well controlled by ICS (equivalent to budes-
onide, 400-1200 μg) at inclusion; and a forced expiratory
volume in the first second of expiration (FEV1) at randomiza-
tion of 70% or more of predicted value. The Asthma Control
Questionnaire (ACQ) score18 required for randomization had
to be from 1 through 1.5 (score range, 0-6; values below
1 = controlled asthma, values above 1.5 = uncontrolled
asthma). Hospitalization due to an asthma exacerbation
within 3 months prior to randomization was an exclusion cri-
terion. Participants could have multiple sensitizations but
were not allowed to have a relevant clinical history of peren-
nial allergic asthma or rhinitis caused by other allergens. As
part of the baseline data collection, site staff collected data
on demographic characteristics, including race and ethnicity
ascertained by multiple choices (Caucasian, Asian, African,
Hispanic, or other [with room for specification]). Information
on race and ethnicity was collected because it was recom-
mended by the US Food and Drug Administration and ICH
guidance (E5[R1], Ethnic Factors in the Acceptability of For-
eign Clinical Data) that sponsors collect ethnicity data in
clinical trials to assist in assessing the relevance of foreign
study population data to US populations and be able to
bridge data to new regions. Further details are listed in
Supplement 2.
The trial design is shown in eFigure 1 in Supplement 2.
Period 1 included screening and switching of all participants
from their regular ICS asthma controller to budesonide and
SABA. Diary recordings of the last 2 weeks of period 1 served
as participant'
s individual baseline. From randomization and
throughout period 2, the participants received their assigned
intervention in addition to ICS and SABA. The duration of the
period varied from 7 to 12 months depending on the time of
inclusion because period 2 had a fixed stop date in October.

During the last approximately 4 weeks of period 2, the par-
ticipant started filling in the electronic diary and recorded
asthma symptoms, medication use, and lung function twice
daily. Efficacy was primarily assessed during the ICS reduc-
tion and withdrawal period (period 3) that began in October
2012 and covered the last 6 months of the treatment period.
Daily ICS use was reduced to 50% for 3 months and subse-
quently withdrawn completely for participants who did not
experience an asthma exacerbation. The primary end point,
time to first moderate or severe asthma exacerbation (de-
fined below), was measured from the start of period 3 until
the time of the first asthma exacerbation.
An asthma exacerbation was defined according to the
American Thoracic Society and European Respiratory Soci-
ety (ATS/ERS) recommendation19,20; and in practice de-
scribed by 1 or more of the following criteria for moderate or
severe asthma exacerbation leading to a change in treatment.
Criteria for a moderate asthma exacerbation included
(1) nocturnal awakening(s) due to asthma requiring SABA use
for at least 2 consecutive nights or an increase of at least 0.75
points in daily symptom score from baseline value on at least
2 consecutive days; (2) an increase from baseline in SABA use
on at least 2 consecutive days (a minimum increase of 4 puffs
per day); (3) a 20% or more decrease in peak expiratory flow
from baseline on at least 2 consecutive mornings or evenings
or a 20% or more decrease in FEV1 from baseline; and (4) a
visit to the emergency department or an unscheduled visit
to the trial site for asthma treatment not requiring systemic
corticosteroids.
Criteria for a severe asthma exacerbation included (1) a re-
quirement for systemic corticosteroids for the treatment of
asthma symptoms for at least 3 days; and (2) an emergency de-
partment visit due to asthma requiring systemic corticoste-
roids,orahospitalizationformorethan12hoursduetoasthma.
Baseline values were defined as the mean values for each
individual participant during the last 14 days of the screening
period.
Key secondary end points included time to first asthma
exacerbation from the start of the ICS reduction and with-
drawal period (period 3) with deterioration in asthma symp-
toms and nocturnal awakenings; changes from baseline in
HDM-specific immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4); and the propor-
tion of participants with a minimal important difference
(MID; defined as change >0.5) in ACQ or standardized
Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ[S]) score with-
out an increased dose of ICS, or with no MID in ACQ or
AQLQ(S) score despite lower ICS usage at the end of trial
(third and fourth key secondary end points). Of the 17 pre-
specified exploratory end points, this article reports the fol-
lowing 3 that are related to the primary end point: (1) time
to first asthma exacerbation from the start of period 3 with
an increased use of SABA; (2) the time to the first asthma
exacerbation from the start of period 3 with deterioration in
lung function; and (3) time to the first severe asthma exac-
erbation from the start of period 3.
Safety assessments included adverse events reporting,
findings on physical examinations, vital signs, lung function
measurements (peak expiratory flow and FEV1), and clinical
safety laboratory assessments (details listed in Supplement 2).
Adverse events were coded using MedDRA (ICH), version 15.0.
Statistics
The principal statistical software used was SAS (SAS Insti-
tute), version 9.3. Details of the sample size calculation and
statistical methodology are provided in Supplement 2 and in
the statistical analysis plan (Supplement 1).
In brief, the power calculation was based on the assump-
tion that about 65% of participants in the placebo group
would experience an asthma exacerbation. The assumption
was based on a small ICS withdrawal trial, in which loss of
asthma control developed in 8 of 12 placebo-treated patients
over the 10-week period of ICS withdrawal.21 A reduction in
the rate of first asthma exacerbation of approximately 30%,
corresponding to a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.70, was considered
clinically relevant. Accordingly, it was estimated that 266
participants per treatment group would provide at least an
80% power to detect a difference between HDM SLIT tablet
and placebo in the time to first asthma exacerbation corre-
sponding to an HR of 0.70 at the 5% significance level (in-
cluding an expected dropout of about 10%).
The full analysis set (FAS) included all randomized par-
ticipants in accordance with the ICH intention-to-treat prin-
ciple. The primary analysis was based on the FAS with mul-
tiple imputations (FAS-MI) of missing data. All other analyses
were based on the FAS.
The primary efficacy analysis of time to first moderate or
severe asthma exacerbation was performed with a Cox pro-
portional hazards regression analysis stratified for country.
Multiplicity was controlled by a prespecified hypothesis test
strategy. The first hypothesis to be tested was the hypothesis
that all 3 groups were equal, controlled by Fisher least signifi-
cant difference procedure.22 This procedure preserves the ex-
perimentwise type I error rate at the nominal level of signifi-
cance in case of 3 treatment groups. Time to the first asthma
exacerbation by individual criteria was analyzed similarly to
the primary efficacy end point. Log-transformed IgG4 at the
end of the trial was analyzed with a linear mixed-effect model.
Analyses of the odds for improvement (defined as a 0.5 points
change from baseline23,24) in ACQ or AQLQ(S) score con-
trolled for ICS was performed with a logistic regression analy-
sis. The 4 key secondary hypotheses were tested in hierarchi-
cal order, first for the comparison of the 12 SQ-HDM group with
the placebo group and then for the 6 SQ-HDM group with the
placebo group. The procedure continued if a hypothesis was
rejected (P < .05). Other secondary analyses were considered
supportive in nature and were not controlled for multiplicity.
Safety data were reported by descriptive statistics only. All
analyses were 2-sided and tested at a 5% significance level.
Results
A total of 834 participants were randomized to receive the 6
SQ-HDM tablets (n = 275), 12 SQ-HDM tablets (n = 282) or pla-
cebo (n = 277). Participant characteristics through the entire
trial are summarized in Figure 1. Across treatments groups, the

number of dropouts were comparable (6 SQ-HDM group, 72
participants [26%]; 12 SQ-HDM group, 77 participants [27%];
placebo group, 68 participants [25%]). The main reasons for
trial discontinuations were asthma exacerbations during the
ICS reduction period (ie, after meeting the primary end point),
adverseeventsandwithdrawalsofconsent.Thenumberofdis-
continuations due to adverse events was numerically higher
in the 12 SQ-HDM group (n = 25) whereas the number of dis-
continuations following an asthma exacerbation was higher
in the placebo group (n = 24) (Figure 1).
Additionalcharacteristicsanddisease-specificbaselineval-
ues are listed in Table 1. There were no major differences be-
tween the 3 groups. The overall mean duration of allergic
asthma was 13 years (SD, 11 years). Approximately one-third
of the population was monosensitized to HDM, whereas one-
thirdhad3ormoreadditionalallergensensitizations.Themean
daily ICS use at randomization was 588 μg of budesonide (SD,
252 μg), and this level remained stable throughout the main-
tenance phase (period 2) of the trial, with no difference in ICS
use between groups at the start of the efficacy assessment

lasted 7 to 12 months; period 3, in which participants began ICS
reduction/withdrawal, lasted 6 months.
c The protocol defined that, following an asthma exacerbation, participants were
offered to continue in the trial at an adjusted ICS dose and provide data to
secondary end points. The participants discontinuing the trial following an
exacerbation were considered to have completed the trial (26 participants in the
6 SQ-HDM group, 22 in the 12 SQ-HDM group, and 28 in the placebo group).

period. Approximately 40% of the participants used 800 μg
to 1200 μg of budesonide per day at randomization. At ran-
domization,meanasthmacontrolscore(asdeterminedbyACQ)
was 1.24 (0.17) for the 6 SQ-HDM group, 1.23 (0.17) for the 12
SQ-HDM group, and 1.22 (0.18) for the placebo group. A pre-
specified evaluation of the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA)
asthma control level (according to an algorithm previously
described)25showedthatoverall72%ofparticipantshadpartly
controlled asthma and 28% of participants had uncontrolled
asthma at randomization. The main reasons for being uncon-
trolled according to GINA criteria were nocturnal awakenings
and activity limitations in combination with daytime symp-
toms, an FEV1 below 80% of predicted value, or need for SABA
use. At the start of period 3 when ICS was reduced, the mean
participant ACQ score was 0.98 for the 6 SQ-HDM group, and
0.93 for the 12 SQ-HDM group, and 1.01 for the placebo group.
Compliance to treatment was 94% with no differences be-
tween groups.
The primary efficacy results for time to the first asthma
exacerbation are shown in Table 2. At the end of the 6-month
efficacy assessment period, 6 SQ-HDM and 12 SQ-HDM tab-
lets significantly reduced the risk of a moderate or severe
asthma exacerbation compared with placebo (HR for the FAS-
MI: 0.72 [95% CI, 0.52-0.99] for the 6 SQ-HDM group, P = .045,

ence between the 2 active groups (HR, 0.96 [95% CI, 0.68-

The proportions of participants with a moderate or se-
vere asthma exacerbation for the FAS are shown in Figure 2.
There were no statistically significant interactions be-
tween treatment and any prespecified subgroup variable (sex,
allergen sensitization type, other indoor sensitizations, or age
group) (Supplement 2).

For the 12 SQ-HDM group, there was a statistically significant
and clinically relevant reduction in the HR for a moderate
asthma exacerbation with deterioration in asthma symptoms
or nocturnal awakenings of 0.64 [0.42-0.96] (first key second-
ary end point), for a moderate asthma exacerbation with de-
terioration in lung function of 0.58 [0.36-0.93], and for a mod-
erate asthma exacerbation with increased SABA use of 0.52
[0.29-0.94] (exploratory end points). For the 6 SQ-HDM group,
only time to first asthma exacerbation with deterioration in
lung function was statistically significantly different from pla-
cebo (HR, 0.60 [0.38-0.95]; P = .030) (Table 2). The explor-
atory analysis of time to first severe asthma exacerbation
showed no statistically significant reductions (HR: 0.79 [0.40-
1.55] for the 6 SQ-HDM group, P = .49, and 0.49 [0.23-1.08] for
the 12 SQ-HDM group, P = .08).
The HDM SLIT tablet groups experienced dose-
dependent increases in allergen-specific IgG4 (to D pteronys-
sinus and D farinae) (Table 2) (second key secondary out-
come). The between-group differences for both active groups
vs placebo were statistically significant from week 4 and on-
wards (eFigure 2 in Supplement 2). At the end of trial, the be-
tween-group difference in log10-transformed IgG4 to D ptero-
nyssinus for the 6 SQ-HDM group vs placebo group was 0.461
(0.417-0.505), P < .001, and 0.595 (0.546-0.643) for the
12 SQ-HDM group vs placebo, P < .001.

Overall, 599 participants (72%) reported adverse events in
a dose-dependent manner with the majority of all adverse
eventsbeingmild(eTable2inSupplement2).Therewasadose-

ment-related adverse events (39% from the 6 SQ-HDM group,
46% from the 12 SQ-HDM group, and 17% from the placebo

oral pruritus, mouth edema, and throat irritation (Table 3). The
most common adverse events had a median onset time on day
1 or 2 after start of the treatment. The median onset in min-
utes on day 1 was 1 to 2 minutes. The median number of days
from start of the adverse event until the event no longer oc-
curred was 4.5 days for oral pruritus, 7 days for throat irrita-
tion, and 23 days for mouth edema. There were no safety find-
ings of clinical concern in the subgroup with asthma classified
as uncontrolled according to GINA.
No deaths occurred during the trial and there were no
anaphylactic reactions, severe systemic allergic reactions,
adverse events requiring epinephrine, or local allergic reac-
tions compromising the airways. Twenty-eight participants
reported 32 serious adverse events of which 5 were assessed
as possibly treatment-related (for placebo [2 participants]:
erosive esophagitis, hepatocellular injury; for 6 SQ-HDM tab-
let [2 participants]: arthralgia, laryngeal edema [moderate,
no airway obstruction or dyspnea]; and for 12 SQ-HDM tablet
[1 participant]: asthma [moderate, alternative etiology was
“recently viral infection”]). There were no clinically relevant
findings from clinical safety laboratory tests, physical exami-
nations or vital signs.

patients with persistent asthma symptoms can be success-
fully treated with anti-asthmatic controller therapy includ-
ing ICS, a significant proportion of patients remain
uncontrolled.5
To our knowledge, this is the first controlled trial to show
that adult patients with HDM allergy–related asthma who
were not well controlled taking ICS can achieve an improve-
ment in asthma control as measured by time to first asthma
exacerbation with a sublingual tablet formulation of HDM
allergen immunotherapy. The trial showed an HR for the
FAS-MI of 0.69 [95% CI, 0.50-0.96] (absolute risk difference
for a moderate to severe asthma exacerbation: 0.10 [95% CI,
0.02-0.16]) in the 12 SQ-HDM group vs placebo group during
the ICS reduction period. For the 12 SQ-HDM group both the
FAS-MI and FAS results for the primary analysis met this pre-
specified effect size. Thus, the HDM SLIT tablet has been
shown to be effective in HDM allergy–related asthma both
among patients well controlled adhering to GINA treatment
steps 1 through 3,12,13 as well as among patients not well con-
trolled adhering to GINA treatment steps 2 through 4 at
inclusion. Together, the data confirm an effect on both cur-
rent asthma control and future risk.
Limitations of this trial include the operational definition
ofamoderateasthmaexacerbationthat,toourknowledge,was
used for the first time. Although being applicable to a trial set-
ting, the establishment of a baseline and the twice daily diary
recordings will have limited usability in clinical practice. Also
the specific selection of patients within a set range of ICS use
and asthma control may pose a limitation. The trial had a
shorter duration than a standard course of immunotherapy
(often 3 years), which limits the conclusions on sustained ef-
fect. Furthermore, because the ultimate aim of allergen im-
munotherapy is disease-modification beyond the duration of
treatment, a follow-up after the end of treatment would have
been relevant. Additionally, the trial was not powered for com-
parative assessment of adverse events.
Although all patients had a positive skin prick test result
for the HDM allergens, 66% of the participants had sensitiza-
tions to additional allergens included in the skin prick test
panel. There was no difference, however, in the response to
treatment with HDM SLIT tablet between patients sensitized
to HDM only and patients with additional sensitizations, sug-
gesting the HDM SLIT tablet was effective irrespective of pa-
tients being monosensitized or polysensitized.
The investigation of the effect on asthma exacerbations
during ICS reduction is a new patient-relevant primary end
point for allergen immunotherapy trials. Trials with asthma
controller medication evaluating exacerbations in asthma
have largely focused on severe exacerbations28,29; however,
the aim in this trial was deliberately to detect asthma exacer-
bations and intervene before they developed into severe
events. The concept of a moderate exacerbation has clinical
utility, as early recognition of exacerbations may prevent
patients from developing severe exacerbations, which ulti-
mately can be life-threatening. We found that the ATS/ERS

exacerbations) was a sensitive primary trial outcome in this
trial design. The measurement of time-to-first exacerbation
was also recommended by the ATS/ERS joint task force
report.20 Previous trials with HDM allergen immunotherapy
have focused on ICS reduction, asthma symptom scores, or
lung function as primary end points with varying
success.30-32 In this trial, the intervention was added to stan-
dard anti-inflammatory treatment of asthma. The fact that
the HDM SLIT tablet prevented asthma exacerbations when
ICS was reduced could indicate an anti-inflammatory action
of the active treatment that maintains the level of asthma
control even in the absence of ICS. Efficacy was assessed in
all asthma exacerbations in general as opposed to exacerba-
tions induced by HDM exposure specifically. Furthermore,
the treatment effect was evident in the primary end point
and in a number of key and exploratory secondary end
points, including immunological parameters.
The HDM SLIT tablet induced allergen-specific immuno-
logical changes typically associated with allergen immuno-
therapy (key secondary end point). This is supportive of the
current assumption that the therapeutic effect is related to
modulationoftheimmunologicalresponsetotheallergen.33-35
The third and fourth key secondary end points, ACQ and
AQLQ(S) score adjusted for ICS use, were novel attempts to
makecompositeendpointsevaluatingsimultaneouslytheMID
change from baseline in ACQ and AQLQ(S) score and change
from baseline in ICS. It was found that 79% to 85% of partici-
pants improved in both the ACQ and AQLQ(S) scores with no
differencesbetweengroups,includingtheplacebogroup.Thus
the active treatment did not provide added benefit for these
composite end points with patient-centered outcomes. The
continuous improvement in ACQ and AQLQ(S) score adjusted
for ICS use over time was seen even following ICS with-
drawal, which was unexpected.
Severe and uncontrolled asthma has been known to con-
stitute a risk in allergen immunotherapy. Therefore, partici-
pants with an FEV1 lower than 70% of predicted value at ran-
domization and participants with an asthma exacerbation
leading to hospitalization within the last 3 months prior to ran-
domizationwereexcludedfromthetrial.Duringtheentiretrial,
the participant’s asthma status was carefully monitored. There
was a dose-dependent change in the numbers of participants
with treatment-related adverse events; primarily mild to mod-
erate local reactions that lasted for some minutes after each
tabletintakeforthefirstdaystoweeks.Thesafetyfindingsfrom
this trial are similar to previous trials with the HDM SLIT
tablet.12-15
Based on a cost-minimization analysis using a Danish set-
ting as an example, the total treatment costs, including only
direct costs, of a 3-year treatment with the HDM SLIT tablet is
€3089 (approximately US $3400).36
Conclusions
Among adults with HDM allergy–related asthma not well con-
trolled by ICS, the addition of HDM SLIT to maintenance medi-
cations improved time to first moderate or severe asthma ex-
acerbation during ICS reduction, with estimated absolute
reduction at 6 months of 9 to 10 percentage points; the reduc-
tion was primarily due to an effect on moderate exacerba-
tions. Treatment-related adverse events were common at both
active doses. Further studies are needed to assess long-term
efficacy and safety.
