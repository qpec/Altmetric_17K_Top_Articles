ABSTRACT
OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to prospectively study and confirm the safety and efficacy of the Tryton Side
Branch Stent in the treatment of coronary artery bifurcations involving large side branches (SBs).
BACKGROUND The TRYTON Pivotal randomized controlled trial (RCT) was designed to compare the Tryton stent with
standard provisional SB stenting in large vessels. The trial inadvertently enrolled patients with too small SBs (<2.25 mm).
The overall trial did not meet its primary endpoint, because of an increased rate of periprocedural myocardial infarction in
the Tryton stent arm. A post hoc analysis restricted to the intended population showed that the trial would have met its
endpoint if only patients with SBs $2.25 mm in diameter (by core laboratory quantitative coronary angiography) had
been enrolled.
METHODS The Tryton Confirmatory Study was a prospective, single-arm extension of the TRYTON Pivotal RCT that
enrolled an additional 133 patients treated with the Tryton Side Branch Stent. It was designed to confirm the results of
the post hoc analysis and emphasized the inclusion of appropriately sized SBs. The primary endpoint was noninferiority
with regard to periprocedural myocardial infarction (creatine kinase myocardial band 3 times the upper limit of normal)
compared with a performance goal based on the TRYTON Pivotal RCT.
RESULTS Among the 133 enrolled patients, 132 (99.2%) had SBs $2.25 mm. Baseline clinical and angiographic pa-
rameters were similar in this study and the RCT. Periprocedural myocardial infarction occurred in 10.5% of patients, which
was numerically lower than the provisional group in the TRYTON Pivotal RCT (11.9%). The 95% confidence bounds did
not extend beyond the pre-defined performance goal of 17.9%, meeting the noninferiority primary endpoint.
CONCLUSIONS The Tryton Confirmatory Study, in conjunction with the post hoc analysis of the intended population in the
TRYTON Pivotal RCT, supports the safety and efficacy of the Tryton Side Branch Stent for treatment of bifurcation lesions
involving large SBs. (J Am Coll Cardiol Intv 2016;9:1338–46) © 2016 by the American College of Cardiology Foundation.

ifurcation lesions are common and represent
up to 20% of coronary lesions treated with
percutaneous
coronary
intervention
(PCI)
(1,2). Bifurcation PCI is associated with a lower proce-
dural success rate and a higher risk for adverse car-
diac events (1,2). Data from multiple randomized
controlled trials (RCTs) support a provisional 1-stent
strategy over a systematic 2-stent strategy for bifurca-
tion lesions (3–11); however, none of these studies
was restricted to true bifurcation lesions involving
large side branches (SBs).
The Tryton Pivotal RCT compared a dedicated
bare-metal stent, designed to specifically secure and
treat the bifurcation SB, with SB balloon angioplasty
alone (provisional stenting) for the treatment of de
novo true bifurcation lesions (12). The intended study
population was specified as patients with bifurcations
involving large SBs ($2.5 mm by visual assessment);
however, more than one-half of the enrolled lesions
had diameters <2.25 mm by quantitative coronary
angiography (QCA). This corresponds to a lesion <2.5
mm by visual assessment (12). The trial failed to show
noninferiority to balloon angioplasty alone with re-
gard to its primary endpoint, target vessel failure (a
composite of cardiac death, myocardial infarction,
and target vessel [main vessel or SB] revasculariza-
tion), despite superior angiographic results (lower
diameter stenosis) at 9 months (12). The failure to
meet the primary endpoint was due mainly to an
increased
incidence
of
periprocedural
myocardial
infarction (PPMI) in the Tryton stent group. A post
hoc analysis of the intended population restricted to
lesions
involving
SBs
with
a
reference
vessel
diameter $2.25 mm demonstrated superior angio-
graphic results and a numeric reduction in target
vessel failure within the noninferiority margin; how-
ever, because of the nature (retrospective, non-pre-
specified) of this subanalysis, an additional prospec-
tive study was required to validate these findings (13).
The Tryton Confirmatory Study was designed in
collaboration with the U.S. Food and Drug Adminis-
tration to: 1) confirm the results seen in the intended
population of the Tryton Pivotal RCT (patients with a
reference diameter $2.25 mm); and 2) confirm
the ability of physicians to enroll appropriate
patients (with appropriately sized SBs).
METHODS
STUDY POPULATION. Inclusion and exclu-
sion criteria were the same as in the Tryton
Pivotal RCT and have been described in detail
(7).
Briefly,
patients
with
symptoms
or
objective evidence of ischemia due to a sig-
nificant ($50% narrowing) true bifurcation
lesion (Medina classification 1,1,1; 1,0,1; or 0,1,1) (14)
located in a de novo native coronary artery with an
SB 2.5 to 3.5 mm in diameter and a main branch (MB)
2.5 to 4.0 mm in diameter were enrolled. Lesion
length was restricted to #28 mm in the MB (treatable
with a single stent) and #5 mm in the SB. Lesion
evaluation was based on visual estimates of the
baseline angiography. Important exclusion criteria
were 1) ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction
within 72 h or non–ST-segment elevation myocardial
infarction within 7 days preceding the index proce-
dure; 2) left ventricular ejection fraction <30%; 3)
impaired renal function (serum creatinine >2.5 mg/dl
or >221 mmol/l) or current dialysis treatment; 4) left
main coronary artery disease (protected or unpro-
tected); 5) trifurcation lesions; 6) a total occlusion of
the target vessel (MB or SB); 7) severely calcified le-
sion(s); 8) the presence of excessive tortuosity; and 9)
angiographic evidence of thrombus.
STUDY
DEVICE
AND
IMPLANTATION. The Tryton
stent is a dedicated bare-metal cobalt chromium thin-
strutted SB stent mounted on a standard stent de-
livery balloon. The Tryton stent has 3 zones: 1) an SB
zone (5.5 to 6.5 mm) to be deployed within the SB; 2) a
transition zone (4.5 mm) to be positioned at the SB
ostium; and 3) an MB zone (8 mm) (Figure 1).
The implantation technique includes the following
steps: 1) lesion preparation (SB pre-dilation was
mandated and MB pre-dilation was optional); 2)
placement of the Tryton Side Branch Stent in the SB;
3) placement of a commercially available drug-eluting
stent in the MB; and 4) simultaneous final kissing
balloon
inflation.

grade <3, vessel dissection type B or worse, or re-

STUDY DESIGN. The Tryton Confirmatory Study was
a prospective single-arm extension of the Tryton
Pivotal RCT that enrolled an additional 133 patients
treated with the Tryton Side Branch Stent and an
approved drug-eluting stent in the MB. The study
mirrored the Tryton Pivotal RCT protocol, which has
previously been described in detail (12). The study
was approved by the Institutional Review Board at
each participating site, and all patients provided
written informed consent.
All serious adverse events were adjudicated by an
independent
clinical
events
committee
(Harvard
Cardiovascular Research Institute, Boston, Massa-
chusetts). A data and safety monitoring board had
access to all study data. All data were analyzed by
independent
consulting
biostatisticians.
An
inde-
pendent angiographic core laboratory (Cardiovascular
Research Foundation, New York, New York) analyzed
all angiograms using a conventional single-vessel al-
gorithm
analysis.
All
patients
were
required
to
receive dual-antiplatelet therapy (unless they devel-
oped
contraindications)
for
12
months.
Clinical
assessment was performed at 30 days and 12 months
post-enrollment. The study emphasized proper SB
selection (i.e., SB reference diameter $2.5 mm by vi-
sual assessment).
STUDY ENDPOINTS. The primary endpoint was PPMI
after PCI, defined as creatine kinase myocardial band
elevation >3 times the upper limit of normal within
48 h after PCI. Patients were compared against a
performance goal derived in close collaboration with
the Food and Drug Administration from the corre-
sponding rate from the angioplasty-only arm (provi-
sional approach) in the intention-to-treat and per
protocol analysis populations in the TRYTON Pivotal
RCT (12,13). Only patients with SBs $2.25 mm by QCA
were included in calculating the performance goal.
This rate was then adjusted upward by 6.0% to allow
for sample variability, resulting in a performance goal
of 17.9% (11.9% þ 6.0%). Noninferiority of the Tryton
Side Branch Stent was defined as a 1-sided 95% con-
fidence bound of the PPMI rate that did not exceed
this performance goal.
Secondary endpoints included the following: all-
cause and cardiac mortality, myocardial infarction,
major adverse cardiac events (a composite of death,
myocardial infarction, emergent bypass surgery, or
target lesion revascularization), target vessel failure
(cardiac death, target vessel myocardial infarction, or
target vessel revascularization), and stent throm-
bosis. Secondary angiographic endpoints included
device success (<30% residual stenosis in the SB) and
lesion success (<50% residual stenosis).
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS. The primary endpoint was
evaluated
by
the
approximate
normal
method.
Continuous data are presented as mean � SD and
were compared using analysis of variance and the
modified Student t test or the Kruskal-Wallis test, as
appropriate. Categorical variables were compared
using the chi-square or Fisher exact test. We per-
formed statistical analyses using SAS version 9.1
(SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina) and considered
p values <0.05 to indicate statistical significance.
RESULTS
PATIENTS AND ENROLLMENT. From July 2014 to
July 2015, the Tryton trial enrolled 133 patients from
28 sites (13 in the United States and 15 in Europe).
Of those patients, 132 (99.2%) had SB diameters
$2.25 mm as assessed by QCA. The baseline clinical

The Tryton Side Branch Stent
The Tryton Side Branch Stent is a cobalt chromium, thin-strut, bare-metal stent that is
composed of 3 zones: 1) side branch (SB) zone; 2) transition zone; and 3) main branch (MB)
zone. The SB zone is a conventionally slotted tube for insertion into the SB. The transition
zone is composed of 3 panels that flare and rotate to accommodate a wide spectrum of
bifurcation angle and large variation in SB and proximal MB diameters. When used in
conjunction with a main vessel stent, the Tryton Side Branch Stent is designed to provide
adequate radial strength and coverage across the carina. The MB zone has a minimal metal-
to-artery ratio that is intended as an open path for an MB stent that will lock the Tryton
Side Branch Stent in place. The Tryton stent is mounted on a standard balloon delivery
system; sizes available during the time of the study were (MB/SB) 2.5/2.5 mm, 3.0/2.6 mm,
3.5/2.5 mm, 3.5/3.0 mm, and 4.0/3.5 mm.

 characteristics of the patients are presented in Table 1
alongside
the
patients
in
the
RCT
who
had
SB
diameters $2.25 mm by QCA. No significant differ-
ences were present in baseline characteristics, except
for
the
prevalence
of
hypertension,
which
was
significantly more common in the Tryton Confirma-
tory Study population compared with the Tryton SB
group (but not the provisional group) of the RCT. In
contrast to the RCT, which enrolled about 10% pa-
tients with non–true bifurcation lesions, all study
patients had true bifurcation lesions (Table 2).
PROCEDURAL
AND
ANGIOGRAPHIC
OUTCOMES.
Among the 133 enrolled patients, 132 (99.2%) received
the study stent in the SB. Procedure, device, and
lesion success rates were significantly higher with the
Tryton stent in both the confirmatory study and the
RCT compared with patients who had the provisional
strategy (p < 0.001 for all) (Table 3). The need for
additional stenting in the SB (bailout stenting) was
required in 3 patients (2.3%; 1 dissection, 2 inade-
quate lesion coverage) who received the Tryton stent.
Procedures were on average longer and required more
contrast and radiation when the Tryton stent strategy
was used compared with the provisional 1-stent
strategy (Table 3).
CLINICAL OUTCOMES. Clinical outcomes are sum-
marized in Table 4. No patient died during the pro-
cedure or within 30 days post-procedure. The primary
endpoint, PPMI, occurred in 10.5% of the patients.
This was numerically lower than the provisional
group in the Tryton Pivotal RCT (11.9%) (Figure 2).
The 95% confidence bounds did not extend beyond
the pre-defined performance goal of 17.9%, and the
noninferiority primary endpoint was met.

Outcomes From the Tryton Confirmatory Study
1341
 DISCUSSION
Drawn
from
133
additional
patients,
the
Tryton
Confirmatory
Study
confirmed and extended the
finding of the large SB post hoc analysis of the Tryton
Pivotal RCT. The principal findings of the Tryton
Confirmatory Study are as follows: 1) among patients
undergoing PCI of true bifurcation lesions with an SB
diameter $2.25 mm, the Tryton 2-stent strategy was
noninferior
to
the
standard
1-stent
provisional
approach in terms of PPMI; and 2) appropriate selec-
tion of patients who may benefit from receiving the
Tryton Side Branch Stent is possible.
The
intention-to-treat
analysis
of
the
Tryton
Pivotal
RCT
demonstrated
that
the
Tryton
Side
Branch Stent was associated with superior angio-
graphic outcomes but failed to meet the pre-specified
noninferiority criteria (12). The high rate of the com-
posite endpoint, target vessel failure, in the Tryton
group was driven by a higher incidence of PPMI. A
closer look at the data revealed that 59% of the pa-
tients had SBs that were smaller than the pre-
specified inclusion criteria. These patients had a dis-
proportionally high incidence of procedure-related
creatine kinase myocardial band elevation (13). Pa-
tients with too small SBs assigned to the provisional
(control) group were treated with appropriately sized
angiography balloons, whereas those assigned to the
Tryton group were treated with a stent mounted on
an oversized balloon. A post hoc analysis of the
intended study population (i.e., patients with SB
diameters $2.25 mm) instead showed a numeric
reduction in target vessel failure, which was within
the pre-specified noninferiority margin, and superior
angiographic outcomes at 9 months (13). The present
study, which was designed in collaboration with the
Food and Drug Administration to validate the post
hoc analysis, confirms the safety and efficacy of the
Tryton Side Branch Stent for the treatment of bifur-
cation lesions with SBs $2.25 mm in diameter.
The Tryton Side Branch Stent is the first dedicated
bifurcation stent to be compared head to head with the
provisional technique in a multicenter RCT. The Try-
ton Pivotal RCT was also the largest RCT to exclusively
studied bifurcation lesions (12). The pivotal random-
ized trial (12) and its large SB post hoc analysis (13), in
conjunction with the present study, not only demon-
strate the safety and efficacy of the Tryton Side Branch

but
also
offer
insights
regarding
what
bi-
furcations should be treated with such technology.
Indeed, although provisional stenting should be the
treatment of choice for small SBs (<2.5 mm by visual
assessment) that supply small myocardial territories,
large SBs represent a condition in which acute, short-
term, and midterm patency of an SB could be seen as
extremely important. Indeed, among the 279 patients
with SBs $2.25 mm receiving Tryton stents from both
the Tryton Confirmatory Study and the Tryton Pivotal
RCT, the need for an additional stent in the SB was 4-
fold lower compared with patients undergoing a pro-
visional approach (1.4% vs. 5.6%). Paired with the
superior 9-month angiographic patency (12), these
findings are extremely important, especially if bifur-
cation stenting is envisioned for even larger SBs, such
as the left main coronary artery.
Procedural,
device,
and
lesion
success
were
significantly higher with the Tryton stent compared
with the provisional approach. Specifically, achieve-
ment
of
final
diameter
stenosis
<30%
with
the
intended initial strategy (w95% for the Tryton stent
vs. w35% for the provisional approach) was superior
in the Tryton group compared with the provisional
arm. In contrast, procedures with the Tryton Side
Branch Stent were longer, with more contrast used
compared with the provisional approach. Actually,
Tryton Side Branch Stent implantation took about 10
minutes more and required about 30 ml more contrast
on average. This finding is not surprising, considering
that the Tryton Side Branch Stent represents a true
“2-stent” approach, compared with the provisional
strategy,
being
the
simplest
“1-stent
approach”;
however, when compared with the data from land-
mark studies using a 2-stent approach such as the
Nordic-Baltic Bifurcation Study IV, procedural time,
fluoroscopic
time,
and
amount
of
contrast
were
similar (15). That being said, procedural length and

 resource use should be weighed against the benefits
of acute and midterm (9-month) SB patency.
The Tryton Pivotal RCT and the subsequent Tryton
Confirmatory Study are studies with a unique design
and scientific process that illustrate important con-
cepts in RCT planning: 1) the importance of selecting
a clinically appropriate target population; 2) the
importance of enrolling the intended population from
which the scientific hypothesis was derived; and 3)
the importance of selecting clinically meaningful
endpoints. Similar to our study, many other trials
have initially failed to meet their primary endpoints
(16–18) to subsequently succeed (19,20) after read-
justments of the targeted population or the primary
endpoints, leading to approval for the population in
which the study device or drug was shown to be
favorable. However, designing trials on the basis of
subgroup findings may not always confirm the initial
subgroup results (21,22), illustrating the need and
value
for
well-conducted,
prospective
studies
to
validate or invalidate subgroup findings. The Tryton
Confirmatory Study used a unique design, combining
the rigor of a prospective registry with identical in-
clusion and exclusion criteria as the Tryton Pivotal
RCT with the statistical advantages of using a his-
torical cohort as the comparator (i.e., the control
group in the Tryton Pivotal Trial as the performance
goal).
STUDY LIMITATIONS. First, this study was not an
RCT; however, the inclusion and exclusion criteria
were identical to the recently conducted Tryton

 Pivotal RCT. Therefore, a reliable optimal perfor-
mance
goal
could
be
defined
(on
the
basis
of
the group that was randomized to the provisional
approach in the RCT). Second, only short lesions (<5
mm) with diameter stenoses >50% were enrolled.
Whether our results can be extrapolated to more
diffuse or physiologically significant (as assessed by
fractional flow reserve) SB disease remains to be
shown. Third, whether the use of the Tryton Side
Branch Stent is cost effective, in light of procedure
time, contrast use, and utilization of other resources
was not addressed in this study. Last, the Tryton Side
Branch Stent is a bare-metal stent. Whether a drug-
eluting version would be superior remains to be
established.
CONCLUSIONS
The Tryton Confirmatory Study, assessing the safety
of the Tryton Side Branch Stent in the treatment of
bifurcation lesions involving large SBs, met its pri-
mary endpoint (performance goal) related to PPMI.
This finding confirms the safety and efficacy of the
Tryton Side Branch Stent in the treatment of bifur-
cation lesions involving a large SB. In light of the
higher
procedural
success
rate,
improved
acute
angiographic results, and higher rate of SB patency at
9-month follow-up compared with provisional stent-
ing, the Tryton Confirmatory Study and the Tryton
Pivotal RCT support the use of the dedicated Tryton
Side Branch Stent in conjunction with standard drug-
eluting stent in the treatment of bifurcation lesions
involving large SBs.

PERSPECTIVES
WHAT IS KNOWN? A post hoc analysis of the Tryton
IDE randomized trial restricted to lesions involving large
SBs ($2.25 mm) demonstrated superior angiographic re-
sults and a numeric reduction in target vessel failure
when the dedicated bifurcation Tryton stent was used
compared with a stenting provisional strategy.
WHAT IS NEW? The Tryton confirmatory study pro-
spectively confirmed the safety and efficacy of the
dedicated bifurcation Tryton stent in the treatment of
bifurcation lesion involving large SBs.
WHAT IS NEXT? Future investigation studying a drug-
eluting stent version of the Tryton stent, especially for
left main bifurcation lesion, or use in combination with
bioresorbable vascular scaffold, are needed and could
potentially improve long-term outcomes of such complex
patient population.
