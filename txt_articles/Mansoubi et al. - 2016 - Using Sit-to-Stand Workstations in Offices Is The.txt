 Abstract 
22 
Purpose: Sit-to-stand workstations are becoming common in modern offices and are 
23 
increasingly being implemented in sedentary behavior interventions. The purpose of this study 
24 
was to examine whether the introduction of such a workstation among office workers leads to 
25 
reductions in sitting during working hours, and whether office workers compensate for any 
26 
reduction in sitting at work by increasing sedentary time and decreasing physical activity (PA) 
27 
outside work.  
28 
Methods: Office workers (n=40; 55% female) were given a WorkFit-S, sit-to-stand workstation 
29 
for 3 months. Participants completed assessments at baseline (prior to workstation installation), 
30 
1-week and 6-weeks after the introduction of the workstation, and again at 3-months (post-
31 
intervention).  Posture and PA were assessed using the activPAL inclinometer and ActiGraph 
32 
GT3X+ accelerometer, which participants wore for 7-days during each measurement phase.  
33 
Results: Compared to baseline, the proportion of time spent sitting significantly decreased 
34 
(75±13% versus 52±16 - 56±13%), and time spent standing and in light activity significantly 
35 
increased (standing: 19±12% versus 32±12 - 37±15%, light PA: 14±4% versus 16±5%) during 
36 
working hours at all follow-up assessments. However, compared to baseline, the proportion of 
37 
time spent sitting significantly increased (60±11% versus 66±12 - 68±12%) and light activity 
38 
significantly decreased (21±5% versus 19±5%) during non-working hours across the follow-up 
39 
measurements. No differences were seen in moderate-to-vigorous activity during non-working 
40 
hours throughout the study.  
41 
Conclusion: The findings suggest that introducing a sit-to-stand workstation can significantly 
42 
reduce sedentary time and increase light activity levels during working hours. However, these 
43 
changes were compensated for by reducing activity and increasing sitting outside of working 
44 
2 
 
 hours. An intervention of a sit-to-stand workstation should be accompanied by an intervention 
45 
outside of working hours to limit behavior compensation.

 Introduction 
53 
Technological and social changes have significantly influenced the way we socialize, travel, 
54 
work and spend our leisure time, and this has resulted in substantial proportions of the day spent 
55 
in sedentary pursuits (i.e. sitting) (11).  Sedentary behavior has recently been defined as “any 
56 
waking behavior characterized by an energy expenditure of ≤1.5 METs while in a sitting or 
57 
reclining posture” (p 540) (27). It refers to too much sitting rather than too little physical activity.  
58 
 
59 
A growing body of epidemiological evidence has linked sedentary behavior to health risks 
60 
including an increased risk of type 2 diabetes (3, 31), metabolic syndrome (12), cancer (3, 21), 
61 
obesity (7) and all-cause and CVD mortality (3, 31). These associations have been shown to be at 
62 
least partially independent of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). Recent reviews 
63 
have noted that there is an inverse association between some sedentary behaviors (mostly TV 
64 
viewing or screen time) and leisure-time physical activity in adults (22, 26), providing evidence 
65 
for time displacement (where opportunities for physical activity are replaced by sedentary 
66 
pursuits). Furthermore, using isotemporal substitution modelling, replacing sitting with standing, 
67 
walking and/or MVPA has been shown to reduce the risk of all-cause mortality (28). Conversely 
68 
the amount of light-intensity activity accumulated, for example during non-exercise related 
69 
standing activities, has been linked to improved metabolic health, independent of MVPA (17).  
70 
 
71 
Adults typically spend time sitting in three domains: the workplace, during leisure time (e.g. at 
72 
home such as in front of a television) and for transport (8). Many adults in the UK are employed 
73 
within sedentary occupations such as office work, and the majority of office workers’ time is 
74 
spent in sitting activities (10, 19). A recent study has shown that office workers typically sit for 
75 
4 
 
 >10 hours/day, with over half of their total daily sitting time occurring in the workplace (10). 
76 
The workplace, therefore, represents a promising environment in which to undertake 
77 
interventions to reduce sitting time.  
78 
 
79 
The incorporation of sit-to-stand workstations may be an effective strategy for reducing sitting at 
80 
work. Limited evidence has been published to date on the utility of sit-to-stand workstations 
81 
although studies are now emerging (1, 6, 18, 24, 29). According to the ActivityStat hypothesis, 
82 
when physical activity is increased or decreased in one domain, there will be a compensatory 
83 
change in another domain, in order to maintain an overall stable level of physical activity or 
84 
energy expenditure over time (15). However, studies examining compensation of sedentary 
85 
behavior or physical activity with the use of sit-to-stand workstations in office workers are rare 
86 
(1). The question remains therefore whether those using sit-to-stand workstations during working 
87 
hours compensate by sitting for longer or being less active outside of work.  This study 
88 
investigated sedentary behavior and physical activity compensation outside working hours in a 
89 
sample of office workers exposed to sit-to-stand desks in the workplace.   
90 
 
91 
Methods 
92 
Participants 
93 
A convenience sample of office workers from a range of administrative departments (including: 
94 
engineering, finance, facilities and health sciences) from a UK university who had primarily 
95 
desk-based jobs and the capacity to include a sit-to-stand workstation on their desk were 
96 
recruited. Participants with the following conditions were excluded from the study: physical 
97 
condition or illness which prevented full participation in the study, inability to communicate in 
98 
5 
 
 spoken English, pregnant at baseline, planning relocation to another worksite or planning a 
99 
holiday during the study period. The study received ethical approval from the Loughborough 
100 
University Ethical Advisory Committee and participants provided written informed consent. 
101 
 
102 
Familiarization visit and screening 
103 
Potential participants were invited to the laboratory at least 2 weeks before the main trial for a 
104 
familiarization visit. During this visit, participants were screened for inclusion/exclusion into the 
105 
study using a standard health screening tool. Following successful screening, eligible participants 
106 
were shown the sit-to-stand workstation, ActiGraph and activPAL assessment devices and 
107 
provided with an opportunity to try the workstation, familiarize themselves with the 
108 
measurement devices and ask questions about the study protocol. During this visit, 
109 
anthropometric measures were taken which included height (measured using a portable 
110 
stadiometer, Seca UK), waist circumference (measured mid-way between the lower rib margin 
111 
and the iliac crest using anthropometry tape), and body weight and composition (measured using 
112 
a Tanita Body Composition Analyzer, model: BC-418 MA, Tanita, UK). Participants were asked 
113 
to wear the ActiGraph and activPAL for the following 14-days to assess habitual physical 
114 
activity and sedentary behavior prior to desk installation. 
115 
 
116 
Objectively measured sitting time and physical activity 
117 
Participants wore an activPAL3 inclinometer (PAL Technologies, Glasgow, Scotland), which 
118 
provides a direct measure of postural allocation (sitting/lying, standing, sit-to-stand transitions) 
119 
and walking. The activPAL3 is a single-unit monitor based on a uniaxial accelerometer which is 
120 
worn on the anterior aspect of the thigh (2). The monitor produces a signal related to thigh 
121 
6 
 
 inclination and has been shown to be a valid and reliable measurement tool for determining 
122 
posture during activities of daily living in a healthy population (16, 20). The activPAL was 
123 
placed within a nitrile sleeve and attached to the leg using a waterproof hypoallergenic medical 
124 
dressing (BSN Hypafix), enabling participants to wear the device continuously for 24 hour/day.  
125 
Participants were asked to wear the activPAL continuously for two weeks following the 
126 
familiarization and anthropometry screening visit at baseline, and for seven consecutive days on 
127 
a further 3 separate occasions: one-week, 6-weeks and 3-months after receiving the sit-to-stand 
128 
workstation. To be included in the analyses, participants were required to have provided at least 
129 
four full days (>600 minutes of wear) of data (including at least 3 workdays and 1 non-workday) 
130 
during each monitoring period.  
131 
 
132 
Along with the activPAL, participants were also asked to wear an ActiGraph GT3X+ 
133 
accelerometer throughout waking hours (ActiGraph, Pensacola, FL, USA) to assess free-living 
134 
physical activity. In addition to the assessment of physical activity, the accelerometer also 
135 
provided an estimate of sedentary time through a lack of movement counts (2). The widely used 
136 
<100 counts/minute (cpm) cut-point was employed to estimate sedentary time (2) whilst the 
137 
Freedson cut-points were used to estimate time spent in light intensity activity (100 – 1951 cpm) 
138 
and MVPA (≥ 1952 cpm) (13). Accelerometer data were considered valid if there were more 
139 
than 600 minutes of monitoring per day (excluding continuous strings of zero counts for 60 
140 
minutes or longer) recorded on at least three workdays and one non-workday on each 
141 
measurement time point (23). 
142 
 
143 
7 
 
 A two week monitoring period was initially chosen at baseline to examine any reactivity 
144 
occurring in response to the measurement protocol (9). As no significant differences in any 
145 
behavior measured occurred between these two weeks (data not shown), the data were averaged 
146 
across weeks, and seven-day monitoring periods were applied during the follow-up periods. 
147 
Participants were asked to complete an activity monitor log book over each monitoring period 
148 
for both the activPAL and ActiGraph in order to document start and finish work times on 
149 
working days, occurrences of monitor removal and sleep patterns (i.e. time in bed). Participants 
150 
sleeping times, monitor removal and invalid days were excluded.  
151 
 
152 
Experimental protocol 
153 
Following the 14 day baseline assessment, participants received a WorkFit-S, sit-to-stand 
154 
workstation (Ergotron, Inc, St. Paul, MN, USA) for 3 months alongside a 6-page booklet 
155 
including information about the advantages of sit-to-stand working. The booklet also contained 
156 
some guidelines about the desk height adjustment and also introduced an online planning tool for 
157 
comfortable computing (www.computingcomfort.org). Participants then undertook three, 7-day 
158 
assessment phases: 1-week, 6-weeks, and 3-months after the desk had been installed. The 1-week 
159 
follow-up took place 1–3 days after completion of the baseline assessment, with this assessment 
160 
also corresponding with the first 7 days following workstation installation. 
161 
 
162 
Data processing and analysis 
163 
As with any accelerometer worn on the hip, the ActiGraph is not capable of detecting sitting time 
164 
due to its inability to directly measure posture (2). Therefore whilst the ActiGraph accelerometer 
165 
provides an estimate of sedentary time, these data were included in the results for descriptive 
166 
8 
 
 purposes only. activPAL-determined sitting, standing and stepping time data were used primarily 
167 
to address the research question of whether the use of sit-to-stand workstations led to changes in 
168 
these behaviors during and outside working hours. The ActiGraph data were primarily used to 
169 
determine whether time in different physical activity intensities (light activity and MVPA) 
170 
differed during and outside working hours over the intervention period. 
171 
 
172 
All activPAL data were downloaded using manufacturer proprietary software (activPAL 
173 
Professional v.7.2.29) in 15-s epochs and processed using a customized Microsoft Excel macro. 
174 
The number of minutes that participants spent sitting, standing and stepping during waking hours 
175 
(based on participants log book entries) were obtained for each working day. To enable the 
176 
examination of the influence of the sit-to-stand desks on behavior during working and non-
177 
working hours, sitting, standing and stepping time were extracted for working and non-working 
178 
hours (based on provided diary logs) from the daily weekday data. To account for differences in 
179 
activPAL wear times between each segment of the day (working/non-working hours) and 
180 
between the baseline and follow-up assessments, the proportions of wear time spent sitting, 
181 
standing and stepping were calculated for each participant during each measurement period. 
182 
These data were used in the analyses as opposed to the absolute minute data.  
183 
 
184 
All ActiGraph data were downloaded using manufacturer proprietary software (ActiLife 
185 
v.6.11.8) in 15-s epochs and processed using a customized Microsoft Excel. The number of 
186 
minutes that participants spent in sedentary behavior, and in light-intensity activity and MVPA 
187 
during waking hours was obtained for each working day. As with the activPAL data (and using 
188 
the same procedures), times spent sedentary, and in light intensity activity and MVPA were 
189 
9 
 
 calculated throughout waking hours, and during working and non-working hours on workdays. 
190 
To control for differences in accelerometer wear time, the proportions of time spent in each type 
191 
of behavior were used in the analyses. Absolute minute data derived from both the activPAL and 
192 
ActiGraph are presented in the results for descriptive purposes. All participants complied to the 
193 
monitoring protocol and provided at least 3 workdays and 1 non-workday of activPAL and 
194 
ActiGraph data during each measurement period. Any days with missing data (due to monitor 
195 
removal) were treated as missing data and the mean time, and proportion of time, spent in each 
196 
behavior during and outside of working hours were calculated from the remaining data.  
197 
 
198 
The Shapiro–Wilk test confirmed that all proportion and minute data from both devices were 
199 
normally distributed. For the activPAL and ActiGraph data, the mean proportions of times spent 
200 
in each behavior on workdays at baseline, 1-week, 6-weeks and 3-months follow-up were 
201 
calculated for each domain (waking hours, working and non-working hours) and compared using 
202 
repeated measures ANOVA’s. In the event of a significant ANOVA result, Bonferroni-corrected 
203 
post hoc comparisons were undertaken to determine where the significant differences occurred. P 
204 
< 0.05 was considered significant, unless otherwise stated, and all tests were 2-sided. All 
205 
statistical analyses were performed using SPSS v.22 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Data are 
206 
displayed as mean (± SD) in the text and tables.  
207 
 
208 
Results 
209 
Forty male and female office workers age 18 - 65 years completed the study, representing a 
210 
100% retention and compliance rate. Participant characteristics are displayed in Table 1. 
211 
 
212

 activPAL-determined sitting, standing and stepping time 
213 
Total sitting time on workdays significantly decreased from 605±83 mins/day at baseline to 
214 
517±70 mins/day at 1-week, 546±65 mins/day at 6-weeks and 561±65 mins/day at 3-months 
215 
follow-up (p<0.001). Total standing time increased significantly from 289±80 mins/day at 
216 
baseline to 383±85 min/day at 1-week, 350±70 min/day at 6-weeks and 344±68 min/day at 3-
217 
months follow-up (p<0.001). No differences were seen for total stepping time. At baseline 
218 
participants spent 605±83 mins/day sitting on a workday, compared to 357±149 mins/day sitting 
219 
on a non-workday (p<0.001). On workdays 49.3 % of daily sitting time was derived from sitting 
220 
at work. 
221 
 
222 
During working hours, compared to baseline, the proportion of time spent sitting significantly 
223 
decreased at 1-week, 6-weeks and 3-months follow-up (p<0.01), while the proportion of time 
224 
spent standing and stepping significantly increased at all follow-up periods (p<0.01) (Table 2). 
225 
During non-working hours, compared to baseline, the proportion of time spent sitting 
226 
significantly increased at 6-weeks and 3-months follow-up while the proportion of time spent 
227 
stepping significantly decreased at 1-week, 6-weeks and 3-months follow-up (p<0.01). No 
228 
differences were seen in standing time during non-working hours (Table 2). 
229 
 
230 
ActiGraph-determined physical activity and sedentary time 
231 
At baseline participants spent 148±31 mins/day in light intensity activity, equating to 16.7% of 
232 
waking hours. During week 1 of workstation use, daily time in light activity increased to 157±25 
233 
mins/day (17.6% of waking hours). There were no significant changes in the overall proportions 
234 
of times participants spent in light activity on workdays at 6-weeks and 3-months follow-up. At 
235 
11 
 
 baseline, participants spent 47±16 mins/day in MVPA (5.4% of waking hours) on workdays. 
236 
There were no significant changes in the overall proportion of times spent in MVPA on 
237 
workdays at each follow-up period. 
238 
 
239 
During working hours, compared to baseline, the proportion of time spent in light activity 
240 
significantly increased at 1-week, 6-weeks and 3-months follow-up (p<0.01). The proportion of 
241 
time spent in MVPA during working hours also increased significantly at 1-week and 6-weeks. 
242 
During non-working hours, compared to baseline, the proportion of time in light activity 
243 
significantly decreased at 1-week and 6 weeks follow-up. No significant differences were seen in 
244 
MVPA during non-working hours. Small, but significant decreases in ActiGraph-determined 
245 
sedentary time were seen during working hours, relative to baseline, in weeks 1 and 6. 
246 
Correspondingly, small increases in ActiGraph-determined sedentary time were seen outside 
247 
working hours in weeks 1 and 6 (Table 3).   
248 
 
249 
Discussion 
250 
This study provides novel evidence of the presence of sedentary behavior compensation outside 
251 
working hours in office workers utilizing sit-to-stand workstations. At baseline participants were 
252 
sedentary for ~10 hrs/day on a workday, with ~50% of this total daily sedentary time coming 
253 
from sitting at work. This is in line with previous research (10, 11) and confirms the importance 
254 
of the workplace as a site highly suitable for interventions to reduce sitting time (19). Results 
255 
from the current study showed that using sit-to-stand workstations is an effective way of 
256 
reducing sedentary time during working hours. This result is consistent with other studies (1, 6, 
257 
18, 24). However, for the first time, this study examined compensation of sedentary behavior 
258 
12 
 
 outside working hours and findings indicated that participants were more sedentary during non-
259 
working hours at 1-week, 6-weeks and 3-months after workstation installation, compared to 
260 
baseline.  
261 
 
262 
Despite the compensation effect observed in the present study, overall sedentary time across the 
263 
day was still reduced when participants were using sit-to-stand desks at work. Total daily 
264 
sedentary times fell to approximately 8.5 hours/day during week 1 of desk use, and gradually 
265 
rose to 9 hours/day at week 6 and to 9 hours 20 minutes/day at 3-months. Evidence has 
266 
demonstrated an increased risk of coronary heart disease and mortality in individuals sitting for 
267 
over 10 hours/day (25). The reductions in daily sitting times observed in the present study, if 
268 
maintained, could therefore have meaningful health benefits. Our knowledge of a specific 
269 
duration of sitting time that represents an increased risk of disease is incomplete however, with 
270 
other research demonstrating that chronic disease risk is increased with sitting durations of over 
271 
8 hours/day (14). 
272 
 
273 
The findings also demonstrate that using sit-to-stand workstations are an effective way of 
274 
increasing standing and stepping time during working hours. These findings are consistent with 
275 
other studies (1, 6, 18, 24). Thus as a result of the intervention, participants time in light intensity 
276 
activity significantly increased during working hours. Slight increases in MVPA were also 
277 
observed during working hours during the early weeks of the intervention. A recent study has 
278 
shown that reallocating just 30 minutes of sedentary time per day to light movement is associated 
279 
with a 2–4% improvement in cardio-metabolic biomarkers (5). Also there is evidence which 
280 
suggests replacing sedentary time with light-intensity physical activity or MVPA is associated 
281 
13 
 
 with positive influences on insulin sensitivity (32) and plasma glucose (30). Such changes 
282 
observed in light intensity activity during working hours could lead to important health benefits 
283 
in previously sedentary office workers.  
284 
 
285 
Results from the activPAL, in terms of stepping time, and findings from the ActiGraph, in terms 
286 
of time in light intensity activity, both confirmed that the proportion of time in these behaviors 
287 
reduced outside of working hours during sit-to-stand workstation use. These findings suggest 
288 
that in order for originally sedentary workers to achieve optimum benefits from sit-to-stand 
289 
working, interventions and public health messages should also target the promotion of light 
290 
intensity activities outside of the workplace. Of interest, time in MVPA did not change outside of 
291 
working hours in the present sample, suggesting that the use of sit-to-stand desks in the 
292 
workplace may not have a detrimental effect on leisure time MVPA.  
293 
 
294 
Findings of the current study lend partial support to the ActivityStat hypothesis which proposes 
295 
that as physical activity is increased or decreased in one domain, there will be a compensatory 
296 
change in another domain (15). Whilst we saw reductions in sedentary time and increases in light 
297 
intensity activity during working hours and compensatory changes in these behaviors outside 
298 
working hours, the magnitude of the compensatory changes were not as great as the changes in 
299 
sitting and light activity seen during working hours, suggesting that participants did not fully 
300 
compensate for the beneficial changes made during working hours.   
301 
 
302 
Participants’ standing time during working hours increased from 91 minutes (~1.5 hours) at 
303 
baseline to 237 minutes (~4 hours, an increase of 146 minutes) in week 1, dropping to ~3.5 hours 
304 
14 
 
 during the subsequent follow-up measurement periods.  Whilst direct comparisons with other sit-
305 
to-stand workstation interventions are difficult, due to differences in procedures adopted for data 
306 
processing, the magnitude of the changes in standing time seen in the present study is similar to 
307 
those observed in other interventions. For example, when normalizing their data to an 8-hour 
308 
workday, Healy et al.(18) and Alkhajah et al.(1) reported increases in standing time of 121 and 
309 
130 minutes/day, in their intervention groups, relative to baseline. According to a recent expert 
310 
statement, office workers should set their goal to achieve 2 hours/day of standing and light 
311 
activity (light walking) during working hours, eventually progressing to a total accumulation of 4 
312 
hours/day (4). It is recommended in the statement that sit-to-stand desks could be a useful tool in 
313 
which to support office workers in achieving these goals. The present study supports this 
314 
statement. The findings indicate however that sit-to-stand desks may not be sufficient over the 
315 
long term and therefore in order to keep participants motivated, interventions may need to go 
316 
beyond simply installing sit-to-stand desks. For example, additional strategies such as 
317 
educational material on the negative health effects of prolonged sitting, and/or office activities to 
318 
encourage standing or stepping may need to be adopted in order for office workers to achieve 
319 
and sustain the recommendations in this expert statement. It should be noted that these 
320 
recommendations were not based on a comprehensive review of the literature, and further 
321 
interventions are required to assess their feasibility, adherence and impact on health. 
322 
 
323 
Whilst the activPAL provided the primary measure of sitting in the present study, ActiGraph-
324 
determined sedentary time (using the <100 cpm cut-point) was also presented for descriptive 
325 
purposes. Discrepancies between these two common measures were observed. During working 
326 
hours at baseline, participants spent 76% of their time sitting according to the activPAL, while 
327 
15 
 
 the proportion of time spent sedentary according to the ActiGraph was 82%.  In week one of the 
328 
intervention, according to the activPAL the proportion of time spent sitting at work decreased to 
329 
52% (representing a reduction of 24%), while the proportion of time spent sedentary at work 
330 
decreased to only 78% (a reduction of 4%) when assessed by the ActiGraph. These observations 
331 
suggest that the ActiGraph cut-point approach is not sensitive enough to measure changes in 
332 
sedentary behavior in interventions, supporting earlier observations (20). 
333 
 
334 
This study provides novel information on how sedentary behavior and physical activity are 
335 
compensated outside working hours in a sample of office workers from the UK exposed to sit-to-
336 
stand desks. The objective measurement of posture and physical activity using the activPAL 
337 
ActiGraph are strengths of this study as such measures overcome the limitations of bias and 
338 
recall, common with self-report measures. Limitations of this study include the small and 
339 
relatively homogenous convenience sample and relatively short term follow-up (3 months). The 
340 
100% compliance rates to all measurement phases and the relatively large changes seen in sitting 
341 
and standing during working hours suggest the present sample may have been a highly motivated 
342 
group. Similarly high compliance and follow-up rates have been observed however in other 
343 
workplace sit-to-stand desk interventions, with reported follow-up rates ranging from 81-100% 
344 
(1, 6, 18, 24). Further research should examine the impact of sit-to-stand workstations on 
345 
sedentary time during and outside working hours in diverse groups to extend the generalizability 
346 
of the present and existing studies. This study did not employ a process evaluation or any 
347 
qualitative components. Further research would benefit from the inclusion of such components to 
348 
help further our understanding of whether participants consciously or sub-consciously change 
349 
their behaviors outside of the working environment.  
350 
16 
 
  
351 
In conclusion, the findings suggest that introducing sit-to-stand workstations can significantly 
352 
reduce sedentary time and increase light activity levels during working hours. However, it 
353 
appears that the changes in sedentary behavior and physical activity during working hours were 
354 
compensated for by reducing activity and increasing sedentary behavior outside of working 
355 
hours. Nonetheless, despite this compensation effect, overall sedentary time was still reduced 
356 
when office workers used the sit-to-stand workstations relative to their traditional seated desk. 
357 
Such overall reductions in sedentary time and increases in light activity could lead to substantial 
358 
health benefits in traditionally sedentary workers. Further research is required to examine the 
359 
long-term use of sit-to-stand desks on changes in sedentary time, and resultant effects on markers 
360 
of health. Further studies investigating the notion of behavior compensation are also warranted.
