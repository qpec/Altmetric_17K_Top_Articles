BACKGROUND
Triple antithrombotic therapy with warfarin plus two antiplatelet agents is the standard of 
care after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for patients with atrial fibrillation, but 
this therapy is associated with a high risk of bleeding.
METHODS
In this multicenter trial, we randomly assigned 2725 patients with atrial fibrillation who had 
undergone PCI to triple therapy with warfarin plus a P2Y12 inhibitor (clopidogrel or ticagrelor) 
and aspirin (for 1 to 3 months) (triple-therapy group) or dual therapy with dabigatran (110 mg 
or 150 mg twice daily) plus a P2Y12 inhibitor (clopidogrel or ticagrelor) and no aspirin (110-mg 
and 150-mg dual-therapy groups). Outside the United States, elderly patients (≥80 years of age; 
≥70 years of age in Japan) were randomly assigned to the 110-mg dual-therapy group or the 
triple-therapy group. The primary end point was a major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleed-
ing event during follow-up (mean follow-up, 14 months). The trial also tested for the noninfe-
riority of dual therapy with dabigatran (both doses combined) to triple therapy with warfarin 
with respect to the incidence of a composite efficacy end point of thromboembolic events 
(myocardial infarction, stroke, or systemic embolism), death, or unplanned revascularization.
RESULTS
The incidence of the primary end point was 15.4% in the 110-mg dual-therapy group as 
compared with 26.9% in the triple-therapy group (hazard ratio, 0.52; 95% confidence inter-
val [CI], 0.42 to 0.63; P<0.001 for noninferiority; P<0.001 for superiority) and 20.2% in the 
150-mg dual-therapy group as compared with 25.7% in the corresponding triple-therapy 
group, which did not include elderly patients outside the United States (hazard ratio, 0.72; 
95% CI, 0.58 to 0.88; P<0.001 for noninferiority). The incidence of the composite efficacy end 
point was 13.7% in the two dual-therapy groups combined as compared with 13.4% in the 
triple-therapy group (hazard ratio, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.84 to 1.29; P 
= 
0.005 for noninferiority). 
The rate of serious adverse events did not differ significantly among the groups.
CONCLUSIONS
Among patients with atrial fibrillation who had undergone PCI, the risk of bleeding was 
lower among those who received dual therapy with dabigatran and a P2Y12 inhibitor than 
among those who received triple therapy with warfarin, a P2Y12 inhibitor, and aspirin. Dual 
therapy was noninferior to triple therapy with respect to the risk of thromboembolic events.

n determining the best approach for 
antithrombotic therapy in patients with atrial 
fibrillation who are undergoing percutane-
ous coronary intervention (PCI), it can be diffi-
cult to balance the prevention of thrombosis 
with the risk of bleeding.1,2 Oral anticoagulation 
is indicated in patients with atrial fibrillation for 
the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism, 
whereas dual antiplatelet therapy with a P2Y12 
inhibitor plus aspirin is indicated in patients who 
are undergoing PCI with stent implantation for 
the prevention of cardiovascular events, including 
stent thrombosis.3-5 Until recently, most guide-
lines recommended both anticoagulation and 
dual antiplatelet therapy (triple therapy).3,6-9 How-
ever, studies have shown that these regimens are 
associated with high rates of major bleeding, 
and such findings have prompted efforts to seek 
new therapeutic strategies.10-15
Two new promising approaches have emerged 
to reduce the risk of bleeding among patients in 
whom both oral anticoagulation and antiplatelet 
therapy are indicated. The first approach is the 
use of non–vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagu-
lants, the first of which was the oral direct 
thrombin inhibitor dabigatran. Two doses of 
this agent were each shown to be effective for 
stroke prevention among patients with atrial fi-
brillation, including those receiving either single 
or dual antiplatelet therapy.16,17 The second ap-
proach is the omission of aspirin from the stan-
dard regimen and the use of a single P2Y12 inhibi-
tor in combination with an oral anticoagulant. 
In a moderate-sized trial involving patients who 
were undergoing PCI and in whom anticoagula-
tion was indicated, the risk of bleeding (and 
vascular events) was lower with this dual-therapy 
approach than with standard triple therapy.18 
Data from another trial supported the use of 
triple therapy for a shortened duration.19 Most 
recently, another trial showed that the risk of 
bleeding was lower with a regimen of reduced-
dose rivaroxaban plus a P2Y12 inhibitor than with 
standard triple therapy.20-22 We conducted the 
RE-DUAL PCI trial (Randomized Evaluation of 
Dual Antithrombotic Therapy with Dabigatran 
versus Triple Therapy with Warfarin in Patients 
with Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation Undergoing 
Percutaneous Coronary Intervention) to compare 
the use of two regimens of dual antithrombotic 
therapy that included dabigatran with the use of 
triple antithrombotic therapy that included war-
farin among patients with atrial fibrillation who 
had undergone PCI.
Methods
Trial Oversight
The trial was designed and led by an executive 
steering committee and the sponsor (Boehringer 
Ingelheim) in collaboration with an international 
steering committee (for a complete list of com-
mittee members, see the Supplementary Appen-
dix, available with the full text of this article at 
NEJM.org). The protocol and amendments (avail-
able at NEJM.org) were approved by the ethics 
committee at each participating center. Data were 
reviewed regularly throughout the trial by an 
independent data and safety monitoring com-
mittee. The trial had an open-label design; how-
ever, all primary and secondary end-point events 
were adjudicated by an independent committee 
whose members were unaware of the treatment 
assignments. The authors vouch for the accuracy 
and completeness of the data and analyses and 
the adherence of the trial to the protocol. The 
first draft of the manuscript was written by the 
first author and revised in collaboration with all 
the authors. Assistance with editing of the 
manuscript before submission was provided by a 
medical writer funded by Boehringer Ingelheim. 
All the authors made the decision to submit the 
manuscript for publication. Boehringer Ingelheim 
provided dabigatran and warfarin, served as the 
data coordinating center, performed site moni-
toring, and performed the statistical analysis 
(which was reviewed by the executive steering 
committee).
Patient Population
Men and women who were at least 18 years of 
age were eligible for inclusion in the trial if they 
had nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and had suc-
cessfully undergone PCI with a bare-metal or 
drug-eluting stent within the previous 120 hours.23 
Nonvalvular atrial fibrillation could be paroxys-
mal, persistent, or permanent, but it could not 
be secondary to a reversible disorder unless 
long-term treatment with an oral anticoagulant 
was anticipated. Patients who had been receiving 
treatment with an oral anticoagulant before PCI 
and those who had not received oral anticoagu-
lation were eligible. The indication for PCI could 
be either an acute coronary syndrome or stable

coronary-artery disease. Key exclusion criteria 
were the presence of bioprosthetic or mechanical 
heart valves, severe renal insufficiency (creatinine 
clearance, <30 ml per minute), or other major 
coexisting conditions. A complete list of inclusion 
and exclusion criteria is provided in Table S1 in 
the Supplementary Appendix. Written informed 
consent was obtained from all the patients.
Treatments
Patients had received standard antithrombotic 
treatment for the PCI procedure. After PCI, pa-
tients who were eligible for enrollment in the 
trial were randomly assigned to receive one of 
three treatments: dual therapy with dabigatran 
etexilate (110 mg twice daily) plus either clopi-
dogrel or ticagrelor (110-mg dual-therapy group), 
dual therapy with dabigatran etexilate (150 mg 
twice daily) plus either clopidogrel or ticagrelor 
(150-mg dual-therapy group), or triple therapy 
with warfarin plus aspirin (≤100 mg daily) and 
either clopidogrel or ticagrelor (triple-therapy 
group). In the triple-therapy group, aspirin was 
discontinued after 1 month in patients in whom a 
bare-metal stent was implanted and after 3 months 
in patients in whom a drug-eluting stent was im-
planted (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Randomization was performed with the use 
of permuted blocks, with stratification accord-
ing to age group (nonelderly or elderly [<80 or 
≥80 years of age; <70 or ≥70 years of age in 
Japan]) and region (United States, Japan, or other 
countries). All patients in the United States and 
nonelderly patients in other countries were ran-
domly assigned to the 110-mg dual-therapy group, 
the 150-mg dual-therapy group, or the triple-
therapy group in a 1:1:1 ratio. Elderly patients 
outside the United States were randomly assigned 
to the 110-mg dual-therapy group or the triple-
therapy group in a 1:1 ratio; they were not eli-
gible to be assigned to the 150-mg dual-therapy 
group, in accordance with the recommendations 
of the dabigatran label in those countries (Fig. 1).
All the patients were to receive either clopido-
grel (75 mg daily) or ticagrelor (90 mg twice 
daily) for at least 12 months after randomiza-
tion; the choice of agent was at the discretion of 
the investigator. The dose of warfarin was ad-
justed to ensure that the patient’s international 
normalized ratio (INR) was within a range of 2.0 
to 3.0. Follow-up was performed every 3 months. 
All the patients had an end-of-treatment visit 
when the trial anticoagulant (dabigatran or war-
farin) was discontinued; a follow-up visit took 
place 4 weeks thereafter. The trial continued until 
all the patients had a minimum of 6 months of 
follow-up and the target number of end-point 
events was anticipated to be reached.
End Points
The primary end point was the first major or 
clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding event, as 
defined by the International Society on Throm-
bosis and Hemostasis (ISTH; detailed definitions 
are provided in Table S2 in the Supplementary 
Appendix), in a time-to-event analysis.24 A main 
secondary end point was a composite efficacy 
end point of thromboembolic events (myocardial 
infarction, stroke, or systemic embolism), death, 
or unplanned revascularization (PCI or coronary-
artery bypass grafting). Other secondary end 
points included a combined end point of throm-
boembolic events or death, as well as the indi-
vidual thromboembolic events and definite stent 
thrombosis. For detailed definitions of the end 
points and a list of other safety end points, see 
Tables S3 and S4 in the Supplementary Appendix. 
All clinical end-point events were adjudicated by 
an independent committee whose members were 
unaware of the treatment assignments. Subgroup 
analyses were planned across major subgroups.
Statistical Analysis
The trial was designed to test the two safety 
hypotheses that dual therapy with dabigatran at 
a dose of 110 mg twice daily and dual therapy 
with dabigatran at a dose of 150 mg twice daily 
would be noninferior to triple therapy with war-
farin with respect to the primary end point. A 
noninferiority margin of 1.38 for the upper 
boundary of the 95% confidence interval was 
used by the Food and Drug Administration for 
registration trials of non–vitamin K antagonist 
anticoagulants to evaluate the risk of stroke or 
systemic embolism.25 The same noninferiority 
margin was used to evaluate the risk of bleeding 
and thromboembolic events in this trial, because 
it was considered to be the most clinically rele-
vant available reference in the absence of any 
other type of data.23 The incidence of the pri-
mary end point was compared between the 110-mg 
dual-therapy group and the triple-therapy group 
with the use of a stratified Cox proportional-
hazards regression model, with stratification ac-

Dual Antithrombotic Therapy with Dabigatran
and the triple-therapy group, we used a corre-
sponding triple-therapy group that included only 
patients who had been eligible to be assigned to 
the 150-mg dual-therapy group (i.e., did not in-
clude elderly patients outside the United States). 
Therefore, the sample sizes for the 150-mg dual-
therapy group and the corresponding triple-ther-
apy group are smaller than those for the 110-mg 
dual-therapy group and the complete triple-therapy 
group (Fig. 1). The primary analysis, which was 
performed on an intention-to-treat basis, included 
all patients who underwent randomization, regard-
less of whether they received treatment. A sensi-
tivity analysis, which was performed on an on-
treatment basis, included all patients who had 
received at least one dose of the trial antico-
agulant; data on events that occurred more than 
7 days after the trial anticoagulant was perma-
nently discontinued were censored.
Assuming an event rate for the primary end 
point of 14% in each treatment group, we calcu-
lated that 167 patients with events per group 
would give the trial 83.6% power to detect the 
noninferiority of dual therapy with dabigatran to 
triple therapy with warfarin, at a one-sided alpha 
level of 0.025. This calculation yielded an esti-
mated total sample size of at least 2500 patients. 
To control the type I error rate, a hierarchical 
procedure for multiple testing was used to test 
the major trial hypotheses. For further details, 
see Table S5 in the Supplementary Appendix.
In the initial protocol, a sample size of 8520 
patients had been planned to allow for a copri-
mary end-point comparison of thromboembolic-
event rates in each dual-therapy group versus the 
triple-therapy group; however, enrollment of this 
number of patients in a timely fashion was deter-
mined to be infeasible. The protocol was amended 
to specify the current sample size, and the com-
parison of thromboembolic-event rates in the two 
dual-therapy groups combined versus the triple-
therapy group was changed to a secondary end 
point.
Results
Participants
Between July 21, 2014, and October 31, 2016, a 
total of 2725 patients underwent randomization 
at 414 sites in 41 countries (for a complete list of 
countries, see the Supplementary Appendix). De-
tails regarding patient disposition are shown in 
Figure 1. Only 6 patients (0.2%) were lost to 
follow-up and had no data on vital status. A total 
of 2.0% of the patients in the 110-mg dual-
therapy group, 0.5% in the 150-mg dual-therapy 
group, and 3.9% in the triple-therapy group with-
drew consent and had no data on vital status at 
the end of the trial. Details regarding the times 
at which patients withdrew consent are shown in 
Table S6 in the Supplementary Appendix. Of the 
patients in each treatment group who completed 
the trial, 130 (13.3%) in the 110-mg dual-therapy 
group, 99 (13.0%) in the 150-mg dual-therapy 
group, and 163 (16.6%) in the triple-therapy group 
stopped receiving the trial anticoagulant pre-
maturely. The mean duration of treatment with 
the trial anticoagulant was 12.3 months, and the 
mean duration of follow-up was 14.0 months.
Baseline characteristics of the patients are 
shown in Table 1 and in Table S7 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix. The mean age was 70.8 years 
(16.8% of the patients were in the elderly age 
group), and the index indication for PCI was an 
acute coronary syndrome in 50.5% of the patients. 
Drug-eluting stents alone were used in 82.6% of 
the patients. Most of the patients received clopido-
grel; only 12.0% received ticagrelor. Details regard-
ing the use of concomitant antiplatelet therapies 
over time are shown in Table S8 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix. In the triple-therapy group, the 
mean percentage of time in the therapeutic INR 
range (calculated by means of the method of 
Rosendaal et al.26) was 64%.
Primary End Point
The incidence of the primary end point (the first 
major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding 
event) was 15.4% in the 110-mg dual-therapy 
group as compared with 26.9% in the triple-
therapy group (hazard ratio, 0.52; 95% confidence 
interval [CI], 0.42 to 0.63; P<0.001 for noninferi-
ority; P<0.001 for superiority) and 20.2% in the 
150-mg dual-therapy group as compared with 
25.7% in the corresponding triple-therapy group 
(hazard ratio, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.58 to 0.88; P<0.001 
for noninferiority) (Fig. 2A and 2B and Table 2). 
Results of the intention-to-treat analysis were 
consistent with results of the on-treatment analy-
sis and with results across major subgroups 
(Table S9 and Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix). The rates of major bleeding alone and 
of total bleeding were significantly lower in both 
dual-therapy groups than in the triple-therapy 
group (Table 2). In addition, when major bleed-
ing was defined according to Thrombolysis in

Secondary Efficacy End Points
The incidence of the composite efficacy end 
point of thromboembolic events (myocardial 
infarction, stroke, or systemic embolism), death, 
or unplanned revascularization was 13.7% in the 
two dual-therapy groups combined as compared 
with 13.4% in the triple-therapy group (hazard 
ratio, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.84 to 1.29; P 
= 
0.005 for 
noninferiority) (Table 3). The incidence was 
15.2% in the 110-mg dual-therapy group as com-
pared with 13.4% in the triple-therapy group 
(hazard ratio, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.90 to 1.43; P 
= 
0.30) 
and 11.8% in the 150-mg dual-therapy group as 
compared with 12.8% in the corresponding tri-
ple-therapy group (hazard ratio, 0.89; 95% CI, 
0.67 to 1.19; P 
= 
0.44) (Fig. S3 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix). Results of the intention-to-treat 
analysis were consistent with results of the on-
treatment analysis and with results across mul-
tiple subgroups of patients, including those who 
had an acute coronary syndrome and those who 
had received a drug-eluting stent (Table S10 and 
Fig. S5 in the Supplementary Appendix). The rate 
of the combined end point of thromboembolic 
events or death was 9.6% in the two dual-therapy 
groups combined as compared with 8.5% in the 
triple-therapy group (hazard ratio, 1.17; 95% CI, 
0.90 to 1.53; P

Rates of additional efficacy end points are 
shown in Table 3. The absolute number of patients 
with definite stent thrombosis was low; events oc-
curred in 15 patients (1.5%) in the 110-mg dual-
therapy group as compared with 8 (0.8%) in the 
triple-therapy group (P 
= 
0.15) and in 7 patients 
(0.9%) in the 150-mg dual-therapy group as 
compared with 7 (0.9%) in the corresponding 
triple-therapy group (P 
= 
0.98).
Serious Adverse Events
Analyses of adverse events included patients who 
had received at least one dose of the trial antico-
agulant. Serious adverse events that occurred 
during treatment were reported in 42.7% of the 
patients in the 110-mg dual-therapy group, 39.6% 
in the 150-mg dual-therapy group, and 41.8% in 
the triple-therapy group (Table S11 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix). Fatal serious adverse events 
occurred during treatment in 38 patients (3.9%) 
in the 110-mg dual-therapy group, 24 (3.2%) in 
the 150-mg dual-therapy group, and 41 (4.3%) in 
the triple-therapy group. Details regarding the 
most common serious adverse events and adverse 
events that led to discontinuation of treatment are 
shown in Tables S12 and S13 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix.
Discussion
The RE-DUAL PCI trial showed that, among pa-
tients with atrial fibrillation who had undergone 
PCI, two different regimens of full-dose antico-
agulation therapy with dabigatran (either 110 mg 
or 150 mg twice daily) plus a P2Y12 inhibitor 
(clopidogrel or ticagrelor) resulted in a risk of 
major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding 
events that was significantly lower than the risk 
with triple therapy with warfarin; in addition, 
dual therapy with dabigatran was noninferior to 
triple therapy with warfarin with respect to the 
composite efficacy end point of thromboembolic 
events, death, or unplanned revascularization. For 
the primary end point of major or clinically rele-
vant nonmajor bleeding, the difference in risk 
between the 110-mg dual-therapy group and the 
triple-therapy group was 48% (11.5 percentage 
points) and the difference in risk between the 
150-mg dual-therapy group and the correspond-
ing triple-therapy group was 28% (5.5 percentage 
points) during approximately 1 year of treatment.

nificantly lower in both dual-therapy groups than 
in the triple-therapy group, findings that reaf-
firmed the safety of dabigatran in these regimens, 
even at a dose of 150 mg. In the 110-mg dual-ther-
apy group, the rate of major bleeding was sig-
nificantly lower (by 4.2 percentage points) and 
the rate of major thromboembolic events was 
nonsignificantly higher (by 1.8 percentage points) 
than the rates in the triple-therapy group, find-
ings that suggest a balance of the risk of bleed-
ing with the prevention of thromboembolism. In 
the 150-mg dual-therapy group, the rate of major 
bleeding was significantly lower (by 2.8 percent-
age points) and the rate of major thromboembolic 
events was nonsignificantly lower (by 1.0 percent-
age point) than the rates in the corresponding tri-
ple-therapy group. These findings indicate a net 
clinical benefit of each of the two dual-therapy 
regimens, and clinicians could potentially select 
one of these two regimens on the basis of a pa-
tient’s risk of bleeding and risk of thromboem-
bolic events.
The strategies for dual therapy with dabigatran 
that we tested incorporated two changes relative 
to the previous standard of care (triple therapy with 
warfarin). First, we evaluated two doses of dabiga-
tran, each of which has been approved worldwide 
for stroke prevention and has been shown to be 
safe and efficacious.16 The benefits with respect to 
lower rates of bleeding parallel those seen previ-
ously in the RE-LY trial (Randomized Evaluation 
of Long-Term Anticoagulant Therapy)16 but ap-
pear to be amplified in this population of pa-
tients, who had a particularly high risk of bleed-
ing and in whom aspirin was discontinued after 
PCI, at the time of randomization. As such, the 
RE-DUAL PCI trial is a large randomized trial 
that validates the concept put forth in the WOEST 
trial (What is the Optimal Antiplatelet and Anti-
coagulant Therapy in Patients with Oral Antico-
agulation and Coronary Stenting),18 but with great-
er statistical power.
In the group that received triple therapy with 
warfarin, the duration of aspirin therapy was just 
1 to 3 months; we adopted this approach in ac-
cordance with evolutions in practice and guide-
lines.27,28 In effect, triple therapy shifted to dual 
therapy for most of the trial period; despite this 
factor, we found that the risk of bleeding was ap-
proximately one half and one quarter lower in the 
110-mg and 150-mg dual-therapy groups, respec-
tively, than in the triple-therapy group. The re-
sults of the PIONEER AF-PCI trial (Open-Label, 
Randomized, Controlled, Multicenter Study Ex-
ploring Two Treatment Strategies of Rivaroxaban 
and a Dose-Adjusted Oral Vitamin K Antagonist 
Treatment Strategy in Subjects with Atrial Fibril-
lation who Undergo Percutaneous Coronary In-
tervention) showed that the rates of clinically 
significant bleeding associated with dual therapy 
with three-quarter-dose rivaroxaban, as well as 
the rates associated with triple therapy with very-
low-dose rivaroxaban, were lower than the rates 
with triple therapy with warfarin.20 The doses of 
rivaroxaban that were used in the PIONEER AF-PCI 
trial were lower than the dose used for stroke 
prevention in the ROCKET-AF trial (Rivaroxaban 
Once Daily Oral Direct Factor Xa Inhibition 
Compared with Vitamin K Antagonism for Pre-
vention of Stroke and Embolism Trial in Atrial 
Fibrillation).29
With respect to the composite efficacy end 
point, our prespecified criterion for noninferior-
ity was met. This trial, which involved 2725 pa-
tients, was not powered to allow for compari-
sons of individual components of this end point. 
We thus have to exercise caution in examining 
the nonsignificant small numerical excesses in 
some components of this end point. It is impor-
tant to note that we studied dabigatran doses that 
have previously been shown (in the RE-LY trial,16 
which involved 18,000 patients) to each provide 
stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrilla-
tion. In choosing any antithrombotic regimen, it 
is necessary to balance the risk of bleeding with 
prevention of thromboembolic events. During 
recent years, clinical guidelines4 and consensus 
statements1,3 have evolved and now suggest that 
dual antithrombotic therapy is an option in this 
patient population (class IIb recommendation). 
Our findings in evaluating two regimens of dual 
therapy with dabigatran provide evidence that 
supports these changes in the guidelines for the 
treatment of this patient population.
There are limitations to our trial. First, we 
amended the protocol and enrolled a smaller num-
ber of patients than we had originally planned to 
enroll, and this limits the power of the trial to 
examine efficacy according to dabigatran dose. For 
the comparison of the composite efficacy end 
point, we combined the dual-therapy groups, 
which gave the analysis reasonable power (83.6%), 
and we prespecified that the comparison was 
part of formal hierarchical testing. Second, al-
though our noninferiority boundary was based 
on previous studies of atrial fibrillation, it was

Dual Antithrombotic Therapy with Dabigatran
used for a different end point. Finally, with re-
spect to the results for both the bleeding and 
thromboembolic-event end points, we may only 
speculate on the relative contributions of the 
omission of aspirin and the type of oral antico-
agulant in the dual-therapy groups and the tri-
ple-therapy group. A trial conducted with a formal 
2-by-2 factorial design would be able to discern 
these contributions, and one such trial is ongoing 
(ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02415400).
In summary, we found that, among patients 
with atrial fibrillation who had undergone PCI, 
dual therapy with dabigatran and a P2Y12 inhibi-
tor resulted in a risk of bleeding events that was 
significantly lower than the risk with triple ther-
apy with warfarin, a P2Y12 inhibitor, and aspirin; 
in addition, dual therapy with dabigatran was 
noninferior to triple therapy with warfarin with 
respect to the rate of thromboembolic events. In 
the dual-therapy regimens, each of the two doses 
of dabigatran led to a balance between the risk 
of bleeding and the prevention of thromboem-
bolic events, which offers clinicians two additional 
options for the treatment of patients with varying 
risks of thromboembolic events and bleeding.
