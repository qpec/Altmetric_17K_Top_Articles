abstract
BACKGROUND: Hyperglycemia in premature infants is usually thought to reflect inadequate 
pancreatic development rather than monogenic neonatal diabetes. No studies, to our 
knowledge, have investigated the prevalence of monogenic forms of diabetes in preterm 
infants.
METHODS: We studied 750 patients with diabetes diagnosed before 6 months of age. We 
compared the genetic etiology and clinical characteristics of 146 preterm patients born 
<37 weeks and compared them with 604 born ≥37 weeks.
RESULTS: A genetic etiology was found in 97/146 (66%) preterm infants compared with 
501/604 (83%) born ≥37weeks, P < .0001. Chromosome 6q24 imprinting abnormalities 
(27% vs 12%, P = .0001) and GATA6 mutations (9% vs 2%, P = .003) occurred more 
commonly in preterm than term infants while mutations in KCNJ11 were less common (21 
vs 34%, P = .008). Preterm patients with an identified mutation were diagnosed later than 
those without an identified mutation (median [interquartile range] 35 [34 to 36] weeks vs 
31 [28 to 36] weeks, P < .0001). No difference was seen in other clinical characteristics of 
preterm patients with and without an identified mutation including age of presentation, 
birth weight, and time to referral.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with neonatal diabetes due to a monogenic etiology can be born 
preterm, especially those with 6q24 abnormalities or GATA6 mutations. A genetic etiology 
is more likely in patients with less severe prematurity (>32 weeks). Prematurity should 
not prevent referral for genetic testing as 37% have a potassium channel mutation and as a 
result can get improved control by replacing insulin with sulphonylurea therapy.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Neonatal 
diabetes that presents in the fi
 rst 6 months should 
be correctly diagnosed as the molecular genetic 
etiology defi
 nes the optimum lifelong management. 
Hyperglycemia is common in markedly premature 
neonates and usually rapidly remits without long-
term treatment.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: Patients with neonatal 
diabetes due to a monogenic etiology can be born 
preterm. A genetic cause is more likely in those born 
with less severe prematurity (gestation >32 weeks). 
Prematurity should not prevent referral for genetic 
testing.

Prematurity (gestation <37 weeks) 
affects up to 12% of all births,

and hyperglycemia is a common 
complication usually attributed 
to an immature pancreas, insulin 
resistance, and abnormal glucose 
homeostatic mechanisms.

3 The 
risk of hyperglycemia is negatively 
associated with gestational age 
and birth weight, with the highest 
prevalence (up to 88%) seen in 
extremely low birth weight (<1 kg) 
preterm infants (<30 weeks) and 
those receiving intravenous glucose 
or parenteral nutrition, usually 
within the first week after birth.

The hyperglycemia seen in preterm 
infants and in patients with neonatal 
diabetes due to a monogenic cause 
may be difficult to discriminate. 
Both groups of patients can present 
shortly after birth and are associated 
with reduced birth weight. Neonatal 
diabetes may affect gestational age 
and so a percentage of patients could 
present prematurely, or certain 
mutations may result in premature 
birth. No studies have investigated 
patients with both permanent and 
transient neonatal diabetes who 
were born prematurely. We aimed to 
assess the clinical characteristics and 
genetic etiology of preterm patients 
with neonatal diabetes.
METHODS
Patients
We examined the Exeter 
International Cohort of 947 patients 
with neonatal diabetes, defined 
as hyperglycemia presenting <26 
weeks of age, who were referred for 
genetic testing to the Department 
of Molecular Genetics at the Royal 
Devon & Exeter National Health 
Service Foundation Trust, Exeter, 
United Kingdom, before July 2012. 
The 750 (79%) patients who had 
a gestational age provided were 
included in the analysis ( 
Fig 1). 
A mutation was classified as pathogenic 
if it was a known cause or highly 
likely to be pathogenic on the basis 
of the mutation characteristics, 
cosegregation in the family, and other 
clinical features consistent with that 
molecular diagnosis. Patients were 
recorded as not having an identified 
mutation if they tested negative for 
at least the 3 commonly occurring 
causes of neonatal diabetes: KCNJ11, 
ABCC8, and INS mutations.
Genetic Analysis
In all patients the KCNJ11, ABCC8, 
and INS genes were sequenced 
as previously described. 
13, 
 
18 
Methylation analysis of the 
chromosome 6q24 region, that 
causes transient neonatal diabetes, 
was undertaken in all patients whose 
diabetes had entered remission and 
in patients who were younger than 
6 months at the time of referral 
for genetic testing. The EIF2AK3, 
NEUROD1, RFX6, GCK, FOXP3, 
SLC19A2, GLIS3, PDX1, PTF1A, 
NEUROG3, HNF1B, 
 and BSCL2 genes 
were sequenced by using standard 
methods in patients when testing was 
indicated by the phenotype or genetic 
information revealing homozygosity 
over the region of the gene (methods 
available on request).
Ethical Considerations
This study was conducted in 
accordance with the Declaration 
of Helsinki and informed consent 
was obtained from all patients, with 
parental consent given on behalf of 
children.
Statistical Analyses
Data were not normally distributed 
so nonparametric analysis was used. 
Patients were coded as preterm 
(born <37 completed weeks’ 
gestation) or term (≥37 completed 
weeks’ gestation). Birth weight was 
converted into gestation and gender 
adjusted SD scores (SDS) according 
to UK preterm growth charts.

infants with and without an identified 
mutation were assessed by using the 
Mann-Whitney U test for continuous 
variables not normally distributed 
(age of diagnosis, birth weight, 
gestation, and time to referral) 
and the χ2 test for categorical data 
(gender, gene affected). Where 
expected frequencies of mutations 
were <5, the Fisher’s exact test was 
used.
Gestation was split into the following 
4 groups on the basis of the degree 
of prematurity: very preterm (<32 
completed weeks, moderately 
preterm [33 to 36 completed weeks], 
term [37 to 40 completed weeks], 
and term plus [>40 weeks]). 
20 The 
association between gestation and 
both birth weight and birth weight 
SDS was assessed by using the 
Jonckheere-Terpstra Test for trend.
Statistical analysis was performed 
by using SPSS version 15 software 
(IBM SPSS Statistics, IBM 
Corporation), and a probability 
level of P < .05 was assumed 
statistically significant.
RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
One hundred forty-six of 750 (19.4%) 
patients were born preterm, of 
which 104/750 (13.8%) patients 
were moderately preterm (33 to 
36 completed weeks) and 42/750 
(5.6%) very preterm (<32 completed 
weeks;  
Fig 1). A genetic cause was 
identified in 598/750 (79.7%) 
infants, of which 97/598 (16%) were 
preterm.
Characteristics of preterm and term 
infants with a monogenic cause for 
their diabetes are summarized in 
 
Table 1. Ninety-seven of 146 (66%) 
preterm infants had a defined 
genetic etiology for their diabetes, 
which was a lower percentage than 
those born ≥37weeks (501/604 
[83%], P < .0001;  
Table 2). This 
was predominantly because of 42 
patients referred with gestation 
<32 completed weeks, of which 
only 13/42 (31%) had a monogenic 
cause for their diabetes. If these very 
preterm patients were removed from 
the analysis, there was no difference 
in the proportion of preterm and 
term patients with a monogenic 
cause for their diabetes (84/104 
[81%] vs 501/604 [83%], P = .59).
Preterm infants with a mutation 
compared with patients born at term, 
presented earlier (age of diagnosis: 
1 [0.1 to 4] vs 6 [2 to 11] weeks, 
P < .0001), had a higher birth weight 
SDS (–1.27 [–2.27 to –0.43] vs –1.76 
[–2.59 to –0.98], P < .001), and were 
referred for genetic testing earlier 
(19 [4 to 212] vs 73 [7 to 473] weeks, 
P = .003;  
Table 1).
Which Genetic Mutations Are Seen in 
Preterm Infants?
The genetic mutations seen in 
premature and term patients are 
shown in  
Table 2. Methylation defects 
at chromosome 6q24 and GATA6 
mutations occurred more commonly 
in preterm than term infants (6q24: 
27% vs 12%, P = .0001; GATA6: 
9% vs 2%, P = .003). Mutations in 
KCNJ11 were less common in preterm 
infants (21% vs 34%, P = .008), but 
there was no difference in ABCC8 
mutations (16% vs 18%, P = .73).

No difference was seen between 
preterm and term infants for all other 
mutations (P > .1).
Can Clinical Characteristics Identify 
Which Preterm Infants Are More Likely 
to Have Neonatal Diabetes?
The clinical characteristics seen in 
premature patients <37 completed 
weeks’ gestation with and without 
mutations are shown in  
Table 3. 
Preterm infants with a monogenic 
form of diabetes were born later than 
those without an identified mutation 
(gestation 35 [33 to 36] vs 31 [29 
to 36] weeks, P < .0001). In keeping 
with this the birth weight was greater 
(1730 [1450 to 2200] vs 1340 [820 
to 1770], P < .0001), but there was 
no difference after correction for 
gestational age birth weight SDS 
(–1.28 [–2.27 to –0.43] vs –1.06 
[–1.98 to –0.20], P = .48). There was 
no difference in the age 
at presentation (1 [0.1 to 4] vs 
0.7 [0.1 to 3.5] weeks, P = .99), or 
gender (% boys, 54 vs 63, P = .27). 
There was an insignificant trend 
for time to referral to be longer in 
preterm patients with a monogenic 
cause compared with those where 
a mutation was not found (19 [4 
to 212] vs 8 [4 to 42] weeks, P = 
.10). Only 1 patient was diagnosed 
with a mutation that at the time 
of referral for genetic testing was 
under a corrected gestational age 
of 34 completed weeks. There were 
12 patients without a mutation 
who were referred with a corrected 
gestational age younger than 34 
completed weeks.
Impact of Gestation on Birth Weight in 
Patients With Neonatal Diabetes
In the preterm patients with an 
identified mutation, gestation-
adjusted birth weight SDS was higher 
than in those born at term (–1.27 
[–2.27 to –0.43] vs –1.76 [–2.59 
to –0.98], P < .0001). The impact 
of gestational age on both birth 
weight and birth weight adjusted for 
gestation and gender (birth weight 
SDS) in patients with an identified 
mutation is shown in  
Fig 2. Birth 
weight increased with gestational 
age (P < .0001), but birth weight SDS 
decreased with gestational age 
(P < .0001;  
Fig 2).
DISCUSSION
In this study of 750 patients 
with neonatal diabetes, we have 
demonstrated that patients with 
a monogenic etiology can be born 
premature. Although mutations 
were less common in children with 
severe prematurity (<32 completed 
weeks’ gestation), probably due 
to pancreatic immaturity causing 
hyperglycemia, it is important to 
note that a monogenic diagnosis was 
still made on 31% of patients in this 
group.
Prematurity in Neonatal Diabetes
We found 66% of preterm patients 
with neonatal diabetes in our 
cohort with a genetic diagnosis 
and conversely 16% of patients 
with a genetic diagnosis were born 
prematurely. This suggests that 
premature delivery may be more 
frequent in patients with monogenic 
neonatal diabetes than the 12% seen 
in the normal population. 
1 There 
are only 2 large independent series 
to compare this with and both have 
limited information on gestational 
age. In an American series of neonatal 
diabetes in patients diagnosed with 
diabetes <12 months of age (n = 
77), at least 1 of the 23 patients was 
born prematurely.

the French Neonatal Diabetes Study 
Group (n = 79), 2 of the 15 patients 
with ABCC8 mutations were born 
premature, 
 
22, 
 
23 whereas none of the 
9 patients with KCNJ11 mutations or 
7 patients with INS mutations (where 
recorded) were born premature.23 
It is unclear whether the 5 preterm 
patients included in the original 
French series had abnormalities in 
chromosome 6q. 
24 More recently, 
in a small study of 15 patients born 
under 32 weeks with transient 
hyperglycemia, 2 patients were 
identified as having a monogenic 
etiology (KCNJ11 mutation, 6q24 
abnormality). 
25 Similar to our study, 
these 2 patients presented earlier 
than those without a mutation. It 
is unclear whether the 13 patients 
without an identified mutation 
had a monogenic etiology because 
genetic testing was limited to 6q24 
abnormalities, INS, KCNJ11, and 
ABCC8 gene mutations. In our study, 
we identified 12 different causes 
of monogenic etiology in preterm 
infants born under 37 weeks.
Genetic Etiology of Neonatal 
Diabetes in Preterm Infants
The high proportion of premature 
infants with 6q24 abnormalities is 
similar to recent reports by Temple 
et al. 
26 Our finding of a higher 
proportion of GATA6 mutations 
in preterm infants has not been 
reported previously, but is not 
unexpected. One feature common to 
both is severe intrauterine growth 
retardation, 
 
27, 
 
28 which may result 
from a reduction in third trimester 
insulin mediated fetal growth. 
18, 
29 
Prematurity may result from early 
elective delivery due to poor fetal 
growth. Furthermore, GATA6 is a 
key transcription factor involved 
in multiple organ development, 
including the endocrine and exocrine 
pancreas. 
27 Critical cardiac anomalies 
have been reported in patients with 
mutations in GATA6 and it is possible 
that prematurity is the result of 
spontaneous or elective delivery due 
to concerns with cardiac functioning, 
although we do not have any data 
to test this hypothesis. 
27 This may 
explain the finding in our data that 
preterm patients who have a genetic 
etiology identified are referred for 
testing sooner than term patients.
Clinical Differences to Aid Genetic 
Referral
It is not possible to accurately 
identify patients who are born 
prematurely with monogenic 
neonatal diabetes on the basis of 
clinical features alone. Although 
hyperglycemia in the very preterm 
infant (<32 completed weeks) 
makes a monogenic cause less 
likely, it cannot be excluded as 
31% of patients in this group had 
a genetic cause identified. Within 
the group of preterm infants born 
under 37 weeks, 36/97 (37%) had 
a potassium channel mutation, 
which would radically alter the 
optimum treatment. This means 
that prematurity should not deter 
clinicians from referring preterm 
patients with hyperglycemia for 
genetic testing.
In our cohort, preterm infants with 
an identified mutation were referred 
earlier than those born at term; 
however, we do not have any data 
about the duration of hyperglycemia 
before genetic referral, or the 
reason for referral. Hyperglycemia 
secondary to prematurity would 
not be expected to persist as the 
immature pancreas, coupled with 
abnormal glucose homeostasis, 
the need for parenteral nutrition, 
steroid administration and stress, 
including sepsis should resolve 
with time. Remitting hyperglycemia 
may also occur in neonatal diabetes 
due to a genetic cause (transient 
neonatal diabetes mellitus), whereas 
in permanent neonatal diabetes 
mellitus the hyperglycemia will 
persist. Resolution of hyperglycemia 
therefore may reflect improved 
maturity or natural remission due to 
a monogenic cause, but persistence 
of hyperglycemia is likely to reflect 
a monogenic cause of neonatal 
diabetes. However, patients with an 
identified mutation did not have a 
longer time to referral.
Impact of Gestation on Birth Weight
Our results revealing reduced birth 
weight in patients with neonatal 
diabetes is well-described. 
30 This 
is attributed to hypoinsulinemia 
during the third trimester of 
pregnancy when insulin-stimulated 
fetal growth should normally occur. 
This is supported by our data that 
demonstrate that birth weight SDS is 
lower with increasing gestational age.
Study Limitations
Our data have a strong referral bias. 
We were only able to include patients 
who were referred to our center, so 
we are unable to say how often the 
hyperglycemia seen in premature 
infants is due to a monogenic cause. 
It is likely that a large number of 
patients with hyperglycemia due to 
prematurity were not referred for 
genetic testing. It is likely that, in 
the absence of sepsis, term infants 
are referred for genetic testing 
more commonly as there is no 
underlying prematurity to explain 
the hyperglycemia. In addition, some 
term as well as preterm infants 
with transient hyperglycemia may 
not have been referred for genetic 
testing. This group of patients may 
represent at a later stage with 
diabetes mellitus, and depending on 
the age at presentation, they may be 
misdiagnosed as having either type 
1 diabetes if they are young and/or 
slim, or type 2 diabetes, if they are 
older or obese. This would result 
in inappropriate management. In 
addition, it may not raise suspicion 
of monogenic diabetes within other 
family members. These limitations 
mean that the prevalence of 
monogenic diabetes in preterm 
infants is unknown, and is likely 
to be overestimated in this cohort. 
Prospective studies are needed to 
determine the prevalence of neonatal

diabetes in preterm infants with 
hyperglycemia.
We are only able to test for known 
genetic causes of neonatal diabetes, 
and it is likely that there are more 
unknown causes. In the patients 
without a genetic cause, we have not 
systematically screened for all known 
genetic causes of neonatal diabetes, 
so it is possible that there are more 
monogenic cases in the cohort 
currently without a genetic diagnosis.
We were unable to determine 
the duration and severity of 
hyperglycemia in our cohort. Further 
studies are needed to determine 
whether the duration or degree of 
hyperglycemia can identify when 
hyperglycemia is likely to be due to a 
monogenic cause.
Implications
Our results indicate that prematurity 
should not exclude a diagnosis of 
neonatal diabetes. As improved 
survival of extremely low birth 
weight preterm neonates continues, 
hyperglycemia will become more 
common in this age group. It is 
likely that there is an under referral 
of preterm hyperglycemic infants 
for genetic testing, particularly as 
some early genetic studies excluded 
patients born prematurely.
The 37% of preterm patients with 
adenosine triphosphate-sensitive 
potassium channel mutations 
is clinically important as these 
patients are likely to be successfully 
transferred from insulin onto oral 
sulphonylureas with an improvement 
in glycemic control. 
16, 
 
17 Identifying 
neonatal diabetes due to other 
genetic causes is also recommended 
to provide prognostic information on 
disease progression, screening for 
comorbidities, and genetic counseling 
for affected future pregnancies.
Recommendations
Because only 13/750 (<2%) patients 
had a monogenic cause identified 
and were born severely preterm, 
we recommend genetic referral of 
preterm patients with hyperglycemia 
if they are born after 32 completed 
weeks in whom septicemia is 
not present. Testing before this 
gestational age should probably 
be limited to those patients in 
whom hyperglycemia persists until 
their corrected gestational age is 
32 weeks.
We report that patients with 
monogenic neonatal diabetes can 
be born premature and hence 
prematurity should not prevent 
referral for genetic testing.
