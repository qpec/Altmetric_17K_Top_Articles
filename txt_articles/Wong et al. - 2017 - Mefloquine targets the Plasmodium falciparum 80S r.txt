Abstract
Malaria control is heavily dependent on chemotherapeutic agents for disease prevention and drug 
treatment. Defining the mechanism of action for licensed drugs, for which no target is 
characterized, is critical to the development of their second-generation derivatives to improve drug 
potency towards inhibition of their molecular targets. Mefloquine is a widely used antimalarial 
without a known mode of action. Here, we demonstrate that mefloquine is a protein synthesis 
inhibitor. We solved a 3.2 Å electron cryo-microscopy structure of the Plasmodium falciparum 
80S-ribosome with the (+)-mefloquine enantiomer bound to the ribosome GTPase-associated 
center. Mutagenesis of mefloquine-binding residues generates parasites with increased resistance, 
confirming the parasite-killing mechanism. Furthermore, structure-guided derivatives with an 
altered piperidine group, predicted to improve binding, show enhanced parasiticidal effect. These 
data reveal one possible mode of action for mefloquine and demonstrate the vast potential of cryo-
EM to guide the development of mefloquine derivatives to inhibit parasite protein synthesis.

 Malaria is a major protozoan parasitic disease that inflicts an enormous burden on global 
human health. In 2015 the disease resulted in an estimated 429,000 deaths with several 
hundreds of millions of people infected 1. The causative agents of malaria are a group of 
protozoan parasites that belong to the genus Plasmodium, a member of the ancient 
apicomplexan phylum of vertebrate pathogens, with P. falciparum and P. vivax being 
responsible for the majority of disease mortality and morbidity, respectively 2.
Antimalarial chemotherapies have long been the gold-standard utility for the prevention and 
treatment of malaria. Over many decades, many different classes of antimalarials have been 
clinically approved and deployed as frontline treatments to combat malaria 3. Despite the 
long-standing usage of these drugs, their mode of actions in mediating parasite killing are 
not well defined. Mefloquine (MFQ) has been one of the most effective antimalarials since it 
was first developed and has been used as a chemoprophylactic drug by visitors staying in 
malaria endemic areas. Neurological side effects associated with MFQ usage 4, have often 
precluded drug being used widely as a first choice for preventative treatment. MFQ has, 
however, been used in combination with the front line antimalarial drug artemisinin globally 
to treat malaria, constituting one of the many classes of artemisinin-combination therapies 
(ACT) pivotal to malaria control. Importantly, in the context of regions that have prevalent 
pools of artemisinin resistant parasites, recent reports have shown that artemisinin-resistant 
strains of P. falciparum are sensitive to MFQ due to decreasing copy number of Pfmdr1, a 
marker of mefloquine resistance 5. In an urgent response to stem the spread of ACT resistant 
parasites beyond the province of western Cambodia, the World Health Organization (WHO) 
has recommended the re-introduction of artesunate and MFQ combination therapy in those 
regions to combat multi-drugs resistant strains of P. falciparum 6. Conversely, in regions 
where MFQ resistance is prevalent, dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine treatment is 
preferentially deployed. Despite the major role of MFQ in malaria prevention and its utility 
in controlling resistant parasites to other ACTs, the molecular basis for its mode of action is, 
however, not known. Previous studies have suggested that the molecular target(s) for MFQ 
likely resides in the parasite cytoplasm since efflux of MFQ from the cytoplasm to the 
parasite food vacuole by the Pfmdr1 encoded drug transporter Pgh-1, is the predominant 
mechanism of MFQ resistance 7–10. Furthermore, a large-scale screen of antimalarial drugs 
previously implied that MFQ might be a putative inhibitor of the P. falciparum cytoplasmic 
ribosome 11. To this end, defining the mode of action of MFQ in the malaria parasite along 
with high-resolution structural elucidation of the drug bound to its target would enable 
structure-guided development of second-generation mefloquine derivatives to enhance drug 
inhibition on the molecular target(s).
Here, we demonstrate that MFQ mediates killing of the malaria parasite by inhibition of 
parasite protein synthesis through direct binding to the cytoplasmic ribosome (Pf80S) of P. 
falciparum. We have solved the cryo-EM structure of the Pf80S ribosome in complex with 
MFQ at 3.2 Å resolution, revealing the interaction between the (+)-MFQ enantiomer with 
residues within the GTPase-associated center of the Pf80S ribosome. The mechanism of 
parasite killing by MFQ via Pf80S is confirmed by genetic interrogation of key binding 
residues, with transgenic parasites possessing amino acid substitutions predicted to alter 
MFQ binding showing enhanced resistance to the drug. Furthermore, using the high-
resolution cryo-EM structure as a reference, we have been able to design de novo MFQ

 derivatives with modifications to a critical MFQ piperidine group. The synthesis of such 
drugs demonstrated that these MFQ derivatives have enhanced antimalarial activity 
correlating with structure-activity relationship. Collectively, these data establish the Pf80S 
ribosome as one of the molecular target(s) of MFQ-mediate parasite killing. Our cryo-EM 
structure of the Pf80S-MFQ complex serves as an important reference for the design of new 
MFQ-based derivatives, expanding our tools to inhibit parasite protein synthesis.
MFQ inhibits cytosolic protein synthesis in P. falciparum
We first determined the half maximum inhibitory concentration (EC50) of MFQ mediated 
killing of the 3D7 strain of P. falciparum, which showed potent antimalarial activity with an 
EC50 of 25.3 nM (Table 1). The effect of MFQ on translation activity was then tested using 
incorporation of radiolabelled S35-methionine and S35-cysteine as reporters for protein 
synthesis. MFQ inhibited protein synthesis by 55%, while parasites cultured in the presence 
of a non-translation inhibitory compound chloroquine (CQ) showed no inhibition (Fig. 1a). 
MFQ-mediated translation inhibition was, however, weaker than other, highly toxic cytosolic 
translation inhibitors such as cycloheximide (CHX) (90%) and emetine (68%) (Fig. 1a). 
Parasites incubated with doxycycline (DOX), a translation inhibitor that is believed to target 
only the ribosome of the parasite plastid (apicoplast) organelle12, 13, showed no effect on 
cytosolic translation (Fig. 1a). No obvious parasite morphological changes following drug 
treatment were observed with parasites treated with various antimalarials (CQ, CHX, DOX, 
EME, MFQ and QUI) showing intact mitochondria and nucleus (see Supplementary Data 
Fig. S1), indicating the assay conditions did not result in significant non-specific 
cytotoxicity. Collectively, these results support the hypothesis that MFQ is an inhibitor of 
cytosolic translation.
Cryo-EM structure of the Pf80S-MFQ complex at 3.2 Å resolution
To demonstrate that MFQ directly acts on the parasite ribosome, the core machinery 
responsible for P. falciparum cytosolic protein synthesis, we solved the structure of P. 
falciparum cytoplasmic ribosome (Pf80S) in the presence of MFQ racemic mixture by cryo-
EM at an overall resolution of 3.2 Å (Supplementary Data Table S1, Fig. S2a-c). A 
difference map calculated between this reconstruction and Pf80S in its apo-form14 showed 
two independent continuous densities with shape and size congruent with MFQ when 
visualized at a threshold of 5 standard deviations (Supplementary Fig. 3a). The well-
resolved densities enabled the accurate placement of two MFQ molecules (Fig. 2a-b, 
Supplementary Fig. 3). The primary MFQ binding-site (designated based on location and 
correlation with MFQ tolerance, as described below) was located within the GTPase-
associated center (GAC) of the large ribosomal subunit (Pf60S) (Fig. 2c and 2e), comprised 
from the protein uL13, the sarcin-ricin loop of uL6, ribosomal RNA helices 94-5 and 
expansion segment (ES) 13, where this site interacted with a (+) enantiomer of the MFQ 
molecule ((+)-MFQ). This region is critical for translation, coordinating the elongation steps 
of protein synthesis by binding the translational GTPases, and activating the energy 
dependent translocation of the tRNA-mRNA complex through the ribosome15, 16. A 
secondary binding site was located at the peripheral surface of the Pf60S subunit 
(Supplementary Fig. 3b) where this site interacted with a (-) enantiomer of the MFQ

 molecule. Two residues (Tyr290 and His294) from uL4 form a pocket that accommodates 
the quinoline ring of MFQ at this secondary site (Supplementary Fig. 3b). In P. vivax, 
however, His294 is substituted by Ser294 in this distal MFQ binding site (Supplementary 
Fig. 3c). Since P. vivax is sensitive to MFQ, divergence in this secondary binding site does 
not, as such, correlate with the inhibitory activity of MFQ on P. falciparum and P. vivax. 
Furthermore, since this region has no known role in translation, we believe it is unlikely that 
MFQ binding at such a site could impact protein synthesis. Of note, the observation of 
primary (functional) and secondary (likely physiologically irrelevant) binding sites for the 
antibiotic tetracycline have similarly been reported previously17.
The identified primary MFQ binding site lies within a crevice formed by a helix of the 
ribosomal protein uL13 (residues 45 – 59) and ES13 of 28S rRNA (Fig. 2d and 3a). The 
non-polar residues Leu15 and Ile42 of uL13 interact with the hydrophobic trifluoromethyl 
group (CF3) located on C8 of the quinoline ring (Fig. 3a). On the opposite end of the 
quinoline ring, the 2-CF3 group forms a hydrophobic interaction with two aromatic residues 
(Tyr53 and Phe56) of uL13 (Fig. 3a). The quinoline ring is further stabilized through a 
cation-Pi interaction with a magnesium ion coordinated to the backbone phosphate of base 
C1442 (Fig. 3a). The hydroxyl group of the linker that bridges the quinoline and piperidine 
ring forms a hydrogen bond with the phosphate backbone of base G1441 (Fig. 3a). Finally, 
the secondary amine group of the piperidine ring forms a further hydrogen bond with Glu55 
of uL13 (Fig. 3a). The inter-atomic distances between (+)-MFQ and interacting residues are 
within the range of 2.6 – 3.5 Å (Fig. 3b). The nature of this binding site is consistent with 
structure-activity studies when MFQ was originally conceived 18. Thus, all three functional 
moieties of (+)-MFQ (quinoline, piperidine ring and the hydroxyl linker) are required for 
binding to the GAC, while a combination of hydrophobic and hydrogen bonds form the basis 
of the interaction. To our knowledge, this site of the eukaryotic 80S ribosome represents a 
novel binding site for a translation inhibitor. Although the thiopeptide and orthosomycin 
classes of antibiotics also target the GAC, they interfere directly with the binding of 
elongation factors to the ribosome (Supplementary Fig. 4) 19. However, given that MFQ and 
thiopeptide/orthosomycin each target the GAC, this suggests that MFQ functions to inhibit 
parasite protein synthesis by inhibiting the polypeptide elongation step.
MFQ binding residues of protein uL13 of the Pf80S confer functional 
parasite killing by MFQ
To assess if the primary MFQ binding site in uL13 is the site of action for MFQ-mediated 
parasite killing, targeted mutagenesis was conducted using CRISPR genome editing 
technology20. Amino acid substitutions (Leu15Ser and Ile42Ser) were introduced into uL13 
in 3D7 parasites (Supplementary Fig. 5, Table S2-3), while wild type residues (Leu15 and 
Ile42) were introduced as a positive control. In the control experiment, parasites were 
obtained within two weeks under drug selection using the dihydrofolate reductase inhibitor, 
WR99210, however no parasites were recovered in two separate experiments when attempts 
were made to introduce both Leu15Ser and Ile42Ser. This implies that Ser substitutions of 
Leu15 and Ile42 in uL13 disrupt the function of GAC of the Pf80S ribosome, leading to 
parasite death. These data demonstrate the essentiality of the GAC for parasite viability, 
Wong et al.

 suggesting (+)-MFQ binding to this site may contribute to parasite death. Consequently, we 
introduced single substitutions to the MFQ binding pocket (Ile42Ala, Glu55Ala, Phe56Ala, 
Leu140Phe) creating four transgenic parasite lines. All four transgenic parasite lines 
carrying single substitutions were recovered in two weeks under WR99210 drug selection. 
MFQ sensitivity testing of each were compared to control parasites carrying an integrated 
wild type uL13 gene to test the significance of the MFQ uL13 binding pocket in parasite 
killing. Despite numerous attempts to purify pure (+) and (-) enantiomers of MFQ with 
different methods, purification of the MFQ chiral enantiomers for drug sensitivity testing 
was not possible for this study. As a result, we performed MFQ sensitivity testing using a 
racemic mixture. Transgenic parasites carrying each single amino acid substitution were 
more resistant to MFQ, which gave EC50s 1.4 – 1.7 fold higher (36.6 nM – 43.8 nM) than 
control parasites transfectant for the wild type allele (EC50 = 26 nM) (Fig. 3c, Table 1, P 
values < 0.05). These data confirm the primary MFQ binding pocket in PfuL13 of the 80S 
ribosome contributes to MFQ-mediated parasite killing.
Previous studies have demonstrated that sexual stages of P. falciparum are insensitive to 
MFQ21, 22. During this phase, the parasite switches to variant forms of rRNA that together 
with the ribosomal proteins form an S-type ribosome that is distinct from the A-type 
ribosomes found in asexual stages23. Comparison of the RNA sequence of the MFQ binding 
pocket between rRNA variants reveals a single base deletion within ES13 of the S-type 
ribosome (C1440 deletion, A-type numbering) (Fig. 3d). Such a change is expected to 
disrupt the local conformation of the primary MFQ binding pocket thus potentially 
explaining the resistance of gametocytes to MFQ. Finally, structural conservation of the new 
binding pocket was explored to determine if it was predictive of tolerance of other major 
protozoan parasites to MFQ. Each of the binding elements are strictly conserved between P. 
vivax and P. falciparum (Fig. 3e), which is consistent with the MFQ sensitivity of P. vivax24. 
Trypanosoma brucei is also sensitive to MFQ25, and most of the MFQ-binding elements are 
identical except for a conservative Glu55Gln substitution (Fig. 3e) that would preserve the 
hydrogen bond formed with the NH group on the piperidine ring of MFQ. In contrast, 
Toxoplasma gondii, which is insensitive to MFQ26, has a non-conservative Glu55Arg 
substitution that would be predicted to sterically hinder binding of the piperidine ring moiety 
(Fig. 3e).
Cryo-EM structure based design of MFQ derivatives with enhanced 
antimalarial activity
Our high-resolution cryo-EM structure of the Pf80S-MFQ complex serves as a reference-
guide to develop MFQ derivatives with improved potency towards inhibition of the Pf80S 
ribosome. Comparative structural analysis with the human cytosolic ribosome27 revealed 
two non-conservative substitutions in uL13 found within the MFQ binding pocket 
(Supplementary Fig. 6a). The first substituted residue (Glu55Ala; Pf: human) would 
eliminate the hydrogen bond between the NH group of the piperidine ring and uL13 (Fig. 3a 
and Supplementary Fig. 6a). As already shown, when a Glu55Ala substitution is performed 
in P. falciparum, it leads to lower MFQ binding and thus a higher EC50 as expected (Table 
1). The second substituted residue (Leu59Lys) would sterically inhibit the binding of MFQ

 by clashing with C4 of the piperidine ring (Fig. 1b, 3a and Supplementary Fig. 6). This 
suggested that this site could be exploited to enhance drug affinity towards the P. falciparum 
80S ribosome. Furthermore, substantial structural differences in the MFQ binding pocket of 
the human mitochondrial ribosome28 indicates that MFQ should not be able to inhibit 
human mitochondrial protein synthesis (Supplementary Fig. 6b).
As a proof of concept towards this goal, we designed derivatives of MFQ possessing 
hydrophobic groups that would extend into the parasite-specific Leu59 region of the binding 
pocket (Fig. 4a-d, Supplementary Data Table 4), while maintaining hydrogen bond 
interactions with Glu55 and the G1441 nucleotide. Synthesis of these MFQ derivatives 
(following previously described methods 29, 30) and evaluation against P. falciparum 
parasites in culture demonstrated subset of these derivatives (MFQ_D3-5) showed 1.9 – 2.4 
fold enhancement in potency towards parasite killing (Table 1: P < 0.05). Thus, changes in 
parasite inhibitory potency of MFQ derivatives was found to be entirely consistent with 
interaction of MFQ to the PfuL13 binding pocket.
Discussion
Understanding the mode of actions of clinically used antimalarial drugs is important for 
designing new compound derivatives that can potentially improve inhibition of their 
molecular targets. To this end, at least two critical pieces of information are required to 
achieve this goal – first is the identification of the molecular targets inhibited by these drugs, 
and an equally important second step, is the high-resolution structure of the drug bound to 
the molecular target to enable structure-guided drug design to improve the potency of the 
drug for target inhibition. Here we have solved these problems for the antimalarial MFQ by 
revealing the P. falciparum 80S ribosome as one of the targets of MFQ-mediated parasite 
killing. In addition, a high-resolution cryo-EM structure of the Pf80S with bound (+)-MFQ 
enantiomer presented in this study, along with proof of principle synthesizing of MFQ 
derivatives with enhanced antimalarial activity, this body of work establishes the foundation 
for designing new MFQ derivatives to inhibit parasite protein synthesis
The inhibition of Pf80S by MFQ is consistent with the known site of action of MFQ being in 
the parasite cytoplasm. This has been demonstrated previously that the removal of MFQ 
from the parasite cytoplasm into the food vacuole by the drug transporter Pgh-1 is the 
predominate basis for MFQ resistance 7–10. Furthermore, the mechanism of MFQ 
resistance in P. falciparum is inversely correlated with chloroquine (CQ) resistance 8, 
suggesting that the primary mode of action of MFQ is not in the parasite food vacuole, the 
compartment where CQ acts to inhibit heme polymerization. By solving the structure of 
MFQ bound to the Pf80S, this has led to the identification of binding residues in the 28S 
ribosomal RNA and protein PfuL13 that interact with the (+)-MFQ enantiomer. This site is 
part of the GAC of the eukaryotic ribosome known for its important role in the polypeptide 
elongation step during protein synthesis, suggesting this is the stage that (+)-MFQ inhibits. 
Importantly, CRISPR-cas9-mediated amino acid substitution of (+)-MFQ binding residues 
in uL13 generated transgenic parasites with increased resistance (highest EC50 = 43.8 nM: 
Table 1) to the drug. The measured EC50s of these transgenic parasites (36.6 – 43.8 nM) in 
response to MFQ treatment is within the range of published EC50s measured in field isolates

 (mostly clustered within 35 - 60 nM) that have a MFQ resistance profile 31. It is important 
to note that the mechanism of MFQ resistance mediated by Pgh-1 in P. falciparum is 
independent of the molecular target of the drug (the mode of killing), which is the aim of 
investigation in this study. Based on genetics evidence from four independent single amino 
acid substitutions of PfuL13 with significantly higher resistance to MFQ, (Fig 3c and Table 
1), the data demonstrate that the Pf80S ribosome is one of the target of MFQ-mediated 
parasite killing.
Interestingly, the potency of MFQ in inhibiting parasite protein synthesis (55%) is relatively 
lower than the highly toxic translation inhibitor CHX (90 %) (Fig. 1a). Mechanistically, 
CHX and MFQ work distinctly based on the mode of their interactions with the ribosome. 
CHX competitively blocks the binding of deacylated tRNA to the E-site of the 60S subunit 
32, whilst on the contrary, binding of (+)-MFQ to its primary binding site in the PfuL13 
pocket of the GAC does not directly compete for binding with any factors. This difference in 
the binding mode likely explains the variation in translation inhibition potency of the two 
translation inhibitors with radically distinct modes of interaction with the 60S subunit. 
Similar to other antibiotics such as thiopeptide and orthosomycin, (+)-MFQ also binds to the 
GAC of Pf60S subunit. Although thiopeptide/orthosomycin utilize a different binding site 
within the GAC compared to (+)-MFQ19, nevertheless, (+)-MFQ would similarly be 
expected to function by inhibiting the polypeptide elongation step during parasite protein 
synthesis. Furthermore, we have demonstrated the functional importance of the PfuL13 
MFQ pocket by introducing amino acid substitutions to residues that form this pocket. By 
replacing Leu15 and Ile42 with Ser, this resulted in a lethal phenotype after transfection, 
indicating the essential nature of this pocket of the GAC for generating viable parasites, 
implying an essential function of the GAC for protein synthesis. Single amino acid 
substitutions to the PfuL13 pocket with the resultant change in EC50s in response to MFQ 
treatment also demonstrate the functional importance of this site of the GAC.
The nature of (+)-MFQ binding to the primary binding site is dominated by a number of 
hydrophobic residues of PfuL13 that form this pocket (Leu15, Ile42, Tyr53, Phe56, Leu59, 
Leu140), whilst a charge residue (Glu55) of PfuL13 and the sugar phosphate backbone of 
the 28S ribosomal RNA (G1441, C1442) also contribute to (+)-MFQ binding. Importantly, 
comparison of uL13 between the human and P. falciparum 80S ribosomes reveals significant 
differences exist in the MFQ pocket. This observation provides a foundation for improving 
the potency of MFQ towards better inhibition of parasite protein synthesis. Two divergent 
residues in human and parasite uL13 (Glu55Ala and Leu59Lys Pf: human) are readily 
identifiable (Supplementary Fig. 6a), which form the basis for increasing the potency of (+)-
MFQ on the parasite translation machinery. We have shown by introducing Glu55Ala that 
mimics the human ribosome increased the EC50 of this transgenic parasite from 26 nM to 
38.3 nM compared to isogenic wild type control. We hypothesize that by an iterative 
optimization process, (+)-MFQ derivatives that effectively engage with Glu55 and Leu59 of 
the P. falciparum uL13 pocket may generate more potent compounds that inhibit parasite 
protein synthesis (Fig 4 and Table 1). Together with recent structural analyses of the Pf80S 
14, 33 showing the many parasite specific features along with structural dynamics unique to 
the parasite ribosome, these data reinforce the idea that the P. falciparum 80S ribosome is an 
increasingly attractive target for antimalarial drug development. Although improving the

 potency of (+)-MFQ towards inhibition of parasite protein synthesis is important for the 
improvement of on-target inhibition, other factors such as safety concerns with MFQ-
associated neurological toxicity due to off-target effects will also need to be overcome in 
order to develop second generation MFQ derivatives with clear clinical benefit over the 
parental form. Furthermore, noting that a 90 nM of MFQ (IC90) concentration only inhibited 
translation by 55 % (Fig. 1a), this suggests other unidentified targets are likely to be 
inhibited by MFQ racemic mixture. Since the cryo-EM structure of the Pf80S-MFQ 
complex presented in this study shows the (+) form of MFQ enantiomer bound to the 
GTPase-associated center-PfuL13 pocket (Fig 2-3), this suggests that the (-) form of MFQ 
enantiomer may be a key factor inhibiting other molecular targets in the parasite.
The identification of MFQ as a protein synthesis inhibitor raises the question of whether 
other related antimalarials such as quinine (QN) and lumefantrine (LF) may also inhibit 
parasite protein synthesis through the PfuL13 pocket. Although these compounds have a 
related chemical scaffold, the substantial alterations in their structure would argue against 
their ability to interact with the PfuL13 MFQ pocket. Further biochemical characterization 
of QN and LF would be required to determine their effect on parasite protein synthesis.
Finally, in this study we have demonstrated how cryo-EM can function as an attractive tool 
for the development of MFQ-based improved protein-synthesis inhibitors. The low yield of 
Pf80S using cultured parasites has so far precluded the ability to crystalize the Pf80S for 
structural studies of drug interaction, although sufficient ribosome material may now be 
feasible for use in biological assays 34. Together with recent elucidation of the structure of 
the Pf80S-emetine complex 14, the barrier to structure determination based on crystalisation 
is effectively removed. Thus cryo-EM is now the method of choice for the design of new 
inhibitors to the Pf80S ribosome.
