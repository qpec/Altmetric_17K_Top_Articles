Across mammals, prenatal maternal stress (PREMS) affects many
aspects of offspring development, including offspring growth.
However, how PREMS translates to offspring growth is inconsis-
tent, even within species. To explain the full range of reported
effects of prenatal adversity on offspring growth, we propose an
integrative hypothesis: developmental constraints and a counter-
acting adaptive growth plasticity work in opposition to drive
PREMS effects on growth. Mothers experiencing adversity reduce
maternal investment leading to stunted growth (developmental
constraints). Concomitantly, the pace of offspring life history is
recalibrated to partly compensate for these developmental con-
straints (adaptive growth plasticity). Moreover, the relative im-
portance of each process changes across ontogeny with increasing
offspring independence. Thus, offspring exposed to PREMS may
grow at the same rate as controls during gestation and lactation,
but faster after weaning when direct maternal investment has
ceased. We tested these predictions with a comparative analysis
on the outcomes of 719 studies across 21 mammal species. First,
the observed growth changes in response to PREMS varied across
offspring developmental periods as predicted. We argue that the
observed growth acceleration after weaning is not “catch-up
growth,” because offspring that were small for age grew slower.
Second, only PREMS exposure early during gestation produced
adaptive growth plasticity. Our results suggest that PREMS effects
benefit the mother’s future reproduction and at the same time
accelerate offspring growth and possibly maturation and repro-
ductive rate. In this sense, PREMS effects on offspring growth
allow mother and offspring to make the best of a bad start.

n many mammals, including humans, prenatal maternal stress
(PREMS) affects offspring development and adult health in
terms of growth, immune function, metabolic syndrome, and life
expectancy (1–7). Although these outcomes are harmful to off-
spring, it is currently debated whether such PREMS effects
represent an unavoidable, nonadaptive constraint or an evolu-
tionarily adaptive recalibration of an organism’s life history
strategy (1, 8–18). At the heart of this debate is the pace of
growth for the developing fetus/infant (19). Growth is a crucial
aspect of early development and life history pace that is often
associated with variation in infant and juvenile survival and
offspring maturation and reproductive rate (6, 16, 19–24). Al-
though growth plasticity and its effects have been well studied (1,
17, 20, 23–25), evidence for PREMS-triggered growth plasticity
remains ambiguous. Indeed, PREMS effects on growth are
known to range from positive to negative effects, even within the
same species (18, 26–31). Furthermore, PREMS effects seem to
be sensitive to the timing of PREMS during gestation and to vary
across offspring life history stages (1, 4, 28–34). Consequently,
there is no consensus about how PREMS affects offspring
growth in mammals. We propose an integrated hypothesis that
combines the two opposing processes of developmental con-
straints and adaptive developmental plasticity.
The developmental constraints hypothesis predicts that off-
spring show reduced pre- and postnatal growth in response to
PREMS. Mothers reduce their energetic allocation to maternal
investment, because they are experiencing a reduction in maternal
energetic intake, an increase in expenditure, and/or a depletion of
maternal capital (1, 8, 15, 31, 35–41). In support of the de-
velopmental constraints hypothesis, PREMS negatively affects
placenta size, fetus weight, postnatal mammary gland size, and
milk yield (1–3, 30, 31, 38–42). Additionally, artificial nursing and
cross-fostering studies in rodents and ungulates indicate that re-
duced postnatal offspring growth rates result from PREMS of the
nursing mother rather than the offspring’s prenatal environment
(43–47). Critical to this hypothesis, reduced maternal investment
constrains offspring development, while benefitting the mother’s
ability to reproduce in the future (8, 16, 18, 19, 21, 48).
From the offspring’s perspective, reduced maternal investment
during gestation and lactation results in nonadaptive growth
plasticity in the form of inevitable developmental constraints (1,
11, 20). Apart from other developmental constraints, reduced
Significance
Maternal stress during gestation causes numerous effects on
infant physiology that extend well into adulthood. We con-
tribute to the ongoing debate on whether these effects are
adaptive outcomes or merely the product of energetic con-
straints by presenting an integrated hypothesis that predicts the
diversity of observed maternal effects on offspring growth, in-
corporating both theoretical explanations into one coherent
framework. Empirical tests of this hypothesis across mammals
suggest that the timing of the stressor during gestation and a
simultaneous consideration of maternal investment and adap-
tive growth plasticity effects are crucial for a full comprehension
of prenatal stress effects on offspring growth. The results sup-
port an adaptive life history perspective on maternal effects that
is relevant for evolutionary biology, medicine, and psychology.

 growth rates result in later maturation and/or reduced adult body
size, which in turn reduces lifetime reproductive success by
shortening reproductive life span and reducing reproductive rate
(6, 20, 21, 23, 24). Fitness may be further reduced, because low
birth weight and postnatal body size are strong predictors of
reduced early survival (6, 20, 22–24, 49, 50). Thus, minimizing
the impact of developmental constraints on growth can benefit
the offspring (18, 20, 23, 24). One process alleviating the nega-
tive impact of growth reduction is “catch-up growth,” i.e., a pe-
riod of accelerated growth following a phase of stunted growth
that allows offspring to return to their target growth canal (25,
47, 51–53). In the best case scenario, catch-up growth produces
an individual matching the population mean in terms of body
size for age and age at maturation (25, 51–53).
In contrast to the developmental constraints hypothesis, the
adaptive developmental plasticity hypothesis predicts faster off-
spring growth and reproduction in response to PREMS (1, 11–
14, 17, 54), which, in contrast to a catch-up process, lead to
overshooting of growth trajectories and increased body size for
age during development (“accelerated growth,” refs. 20, 26, 27,
29, 32, 53, and 55–57). From life history theory, the adaptive
developmental plasticity hypothesis predicts that PREMS that is
associated with reduced offspring longevity triggers a recalibra-
tion of offspring developmental trajectories toward a “faster” life
history strategy altogether (11, 12, 14, 15, 20, 21, 54). In support
of the hypothesis, prenatal adversity can be associated with
accelerated growth (26, 27, 29, 32), earlier reproduction (27, 58–
60), and a shorter life span (refs. 5–7, 49, 61, and 62; see also,
refs. 15, 24, and 63). Accelerated development is thought to
come at the costs of more quality-related functions like physical
maintenance and immune defense (23, 24, 29, 47, 64). Despite
these costs, adaptive growth plasticity can evolve, provided the
fitness outcomes of an organism with an adjusted life history are
higher than a nonadjusted one under similar constraints (11, 12,
15, 23, 24, 65). Under adaptive growth plasticity, offspring grow
faster and achieve maturational milestones earlier and re-
produce faster than they would otherwise.
Several hypotheses integrate these ideas, i.e., that PREMS
causes deleterious effects in the offspring and may also lead to
a recalibration of offspring phenotype (10, 11, 15, 17, 18).
Nederhof and Schmidt (66) propose that developmental con-
straints result from the lack of (complete) recalibration of off-
spring phenotype, whereas adaptive developmental plasticity in
the broader sense results from successful recalibration. Other
hypotheses suggest that developmental constraints are inevitable
consequences of PREMS, resulting from mothers with reduced
capital investing less in their dependent offspring (11, 19, 67). In
response to such unavoidable constraints, offspring may engage
in later catch-up growth to avoid the fitness consequences of
small body size and late maturation (17–19, 23, 47) at the costs of
metabolic changes. Alternatively, offspring accelerate their life
history strategy directly in response to their own disadvantaged
prenatal somatic state or indirectly in response to a cue that
reliably predicts this state (11, 15). One reliable cue may be
maternal secretion of glucocorticoid (GC) hormones (like cor-
tisol) during prenatal development (1–4, 8, 18). Maternal glu-
cocorticoids are known to increase immediately in response to
environmental challenges to the mother (1–3, 26, 27, 32). Off-
spring exposed to elevated maternal glucocorticoids (prenatally
via the bloodstream or postnatally via the mother’s milk) expe-
rience a wide range of stress effects, including accelerated and
decelerated offspring growth (1, 2, 4, 18, 26, 28, 29, 57, 68–72).
We borrow the notions that maternal phenotype is the only
relevant information about the environment available to the
unborn offspring (9, 10, 17, 67) and that information about
expected levels of maternal investment and other aspects of
maternal capital may be used to prenatally recalibrate offspring
life history pace (11, 15). Building on these hypotheses, we
propose an integrated hypothesis of PREMS effects on offspring
growth, combining the effects of reduced maternal investment
and a counteracting adaptive growth plasticity (Fig. 1; see also
refs. 8, 10, and 18). We suggest that PREMS negatively affects
maternal capital and investment and is associated with a rise in
maternal glucocorticoid level that triggers an adaptive recalibra-
tion of offspring life history strategy toward accelerated matura-
tion. The reduced maternal investment and the accelerated life
history pace then both act on offspring growth, and the observed
variation in PREMS effects on offspring growth captures the cu-
mulative impact of these two opposing processes, which changes
with the developmental period (Fig. 1). We predict that the effects
originally caused by developmental constraints due to reduced
maternal investment cease with increasing levels of offspring in-
dependence (Fig. 1 A and C; see also refs. 17, 19, 35, and 73),
whereas the effects of adaptive growth plasticity (and its corre-
sponding prenatal life history recalibration) are maintained
throughout development (Fig. 1 A and B). As such, during ges-
tation, both processes coincide and potentially cancel each other
out, while after weaning, only the growth-accelerating life history
recalibration is evident (Fig. 1D). The lactation period, as a period
of gradually increasing nutritional independence in mammals (35,
73), is intermediate between gestation (full dependence) and
postindependence (full independence; Fig. 1).
We tested these predictions in comparative analyses using
published data on nonhuman mammals. As the timing of
PREMS can differentially affect outcomes, we modeled the ef-
fects of early vs. late PREMS (4, 28, 30, 33, 59, 74). We assessed
whether the effects are elicited by glucocorticoid manipulation
without applying external stressors. Because PREMS effects may
be particularly strong if caused by food restriction resulting in a
direct reduction in maternal capital and investment (29, 75), we
controlled for the type of stressor. PREMS effects may be fur-
ther confounded by the length of PREMS exposure, the length of
the potential recovery period following PREMS exposure until
parturition, offspring sex, and species-level precociality; hence,
we controlled for these variables in all analyses (1, 18, 30, 73).
We tested whether growth acceleration follows periods of re-
duced growth and leads to canalization to potentially rule out
conventional catch-up growth processes as alternative explana-
tions of results.
Methods
We searched the literature for studies reporting PREMS effects on offspring
growth during gestation, lactation, and/or after weaning. We conducted a
full text search in Google Scholar (February 5, 2017) with the following search
terms: (intitle:stress OR intitle:cortisol OR intitle:glucocorticoid OR intitle:hca
OR intitle:acth OR intitle:dexamethasone OR intitle:“food restriction” OR
intitle:“food deprivation” OR intitle:undernutrition) AND (intitle:prenatal OR
intitle:gestation OR intitle:gestational OR intitle:pregnant OR intitle:in-
trauterine) AND (intext:growth OR intext:size OR intext:length OR intext:
weight). To minimize potential limitations caused by Google Scholar, we
parceled this search up into several subsearches searching for three to four of
the stress-related terms, respectively.
We identified 3,035 papers that were surveyed for mammal studies that
met the following criteria: the study (i) provides a clearly identifiable control
group and PREMS-treatment group, which only differ in PREMS treatment;
(ii) provides one clearly defined period of PREMS exposure that was re-
stricted to the gestation period, with no additional differences in treatment
before conception and after parturition, and no direct treatment or surgery
of the fetus or placenta; (iii) was conducted on intact individuals (e.g., ex-
cluding studies involving gene knockouts, adrenalectomy, and poison ad-
ministration); (iv) was without reported significant differences in offspring
mortality between treatment groups (which is usually size dependent);
(v) reports data and/or statistics on offspring body size or growth rate,
allowing the comparison of offspring growth rates between the treatment
and the control group explicitly for gestation, lactation, and/or the post-
weaning period, respectively; (vi) cannot explain growth rate differences be-
tween the control and the treatment group by reported significant group
differences in gestation length or litter size; and (vii) presents data on postnatal

 traits in offspring being either nursed by mother (main dataset) or cross-
fostered (including unconstrained artificial nursing). We checked for study
redundancy, and in the case of multiple publications reporting on the same
study population, results were combined into one dataset. We further ex-
cluded all values based on unknown sample size (see below). Altogether, we
found 719 studies from 388 publications that met our criteria, comprising
the main dataset (658 studies from 385 publications providing 1,125 values
across developmental periods, Dataset S1, Table S1a) and the cross-foster
dataset (61 studies from 28 publications, Dataset S1, Table S1b). The studies
were conducted on 21 different mammal species ranging from rodents to
ungulates and primates (Datasets S1 and S2).
From these studies, we recorded the species, type of stressor, beginning
and end of PREMS exposure, gestation length, and offspring sex (male, fe-
male, or mixed). For each of the three developmental periods, we recorded
how the offspring growth rate and final body size of the treatment group
differed from the control group (relative growth rate, relative body size).
Appropriate growth rate data were reported, however, in only 6% of
the studies.
Although 84% of studies reported body size data that enabled assessment
of differences in general growth rate, none of the studies reported individual
values, data on temporal individual correlations, or any other statistics that
would allow assessing the inevitable dependency of the data due to repeated
measurements. Thus, although numerous studies reported on offspring
growth, we were unable to access error terms of effect sizes in all but a few
studies. We therefore ran a metaanalysis on ordinal instead of continuous
data, that is, on the direction instead of the size of the PREMS effects. We
extracted information on the existence and direction of PREMS effects
scoring whether the offspring of PREMS mothers showed higher (1), equal (0),
or lower (−1) growth rates and body sizes than the offspring of control (i.e.,
untreated) mothers. These effect scores were used in all statistical analyses.
Effect scores were based on the statistical significance of the results or, if the
respective significance levels were not reported, estimated from group-specific
means ± SE (and their age trajectories). Postindependence (juvenile) values
were derived within the periods of linear growth, that is, before growth tra-
jectories asymptotically approach zero (25).
Considering the nature of the response variable, we applied cumulative
link mixed models (CLMMs) [with Logit link function, R package “ordinal”
(76); and Kendall’s tau B correlations (function cor.test) and one-sample
Wilcoxon tests [R package “exactRankTests” (77)], which are both cor-
rected for the number of ties. All analyses were run with R 3.3.2 (78), all tests
were two-tailed with alpha level set to 0.05, and all P values were adjusted
for multiple testing using p.adjust with Holm correction. All CLMMs included
species and study population as random effects to control for species-specific
attributes like gestation length, life expectancy, and number of studies,
as well as study population-specific repeated measures. All models further
included five control variables: length of PREMS exposure and length of the
subsequent recovery period until parturition in percent of gestation length
(continuous measures), species precociality (binomial measure, with primates
Fig. 1.
Schematic illustration of the integrated hypothesis predicting PREMS effects on offspring growth resulting from the opposing effects of reduced
maternal investment and adaptive growth plasticity. (A) PREMS negatively impacts maternal physical condition resulting in reduced maternal investment
and increased glucocorticoid levels. (B) Elevated prenatal glucocorticoid levels increase offspring growth rate throughout development, whereas (C) re-
duced maternal investment results in developmental constraints on preindependence offspring growth. (D) If both processes coincide, effects may cancel
each other out during preindependence, resulting in a realized growth rate that is not different from an unaltered growth rate. Importantly, post-
independence growth rate is not affected by maternal investment and therefore reflects adaptive growth plasticity only with increased growth rates com-
pared with controls.

 labeled as precocial), offspring sex (male, female, or both), and sample size. If
sample size for a certain developmental period was not reported, we esti-
mated the sample size based on reported degrees of freedom or calculated it
from the number of mothers per treatment, litter size, survival rates, and/or
sex ratios. Sample size, however, was undetectable for ∼4% of the values.
Since the CLMM algorithm handles missing values by casewise deletion only,
these cases were excluded from all analyses to maintain consistency. All po-
tential two- and three-way interaction terms involving sample size were
nonsignificant and excluded from the final models.
We additionally ran all models using more conservative, reduced datasets
(reduced main dataset: 499 studies from 303 publications providing 877 values
across developmental periods, Dataset S1, Table S1a; reduced cross-foster
dataset: 45 studies from 22 publications, Dataset S1, Table S1b). In these re-
duced datasets we excluded all studies that reported neither a PREMS effect
on prenatal maternal glucocorticoid levels nor an effect on offspring growth,
since in these cases it remains unclear whether the stressor was sufficient to
provoke the PREMS effect of interest. This is of particular importance as
nondetectable PREMS effects on offspring growth due to a balancing of the
two proposed processes during gestation/lactation as well as the post-
independence absence of developmental constraints are central to our pre-
dictions (Fig. 1).
To test our predictions (Fig. 1), we first ran a CLMM on the main dataset
(Fig. 2). We analyzed how PREMS effects on offspring growth depend on the
level of offspring independence (as reflected by the three consecutive de-
velopmental periods) and the timing of PREMS onset (first half vs. second
half of gestation).
To test whether the effects of food restriction were different from the
effects elicited by other types of stressors, we ran two additional models: one
model on data only from studies using nonfood stressors (Fig. S2C) and one
model on the full dataset, including the interaction term between stressor
type and our test variables developmental period and PREMS onset (Fig. S2D).
We further tested whether the observed patterns in the data hold if
mothers’ glucocorticoid levels were directly manipulated or whether the
observed effects depend on external stress treatment. We first ran a model
on a subset of the data that were generated with glucocorticoid manipulation
only (Fig. S3C), and then a model on our entire dataset with interaction terms
of stress manipulation type (direct glucocorticoid administration/manipulation
vs. external stressor) with our test variables (Fig. S3D).
Then, we examined cross-fostering and unconstrained artificial nursing
studies. These studies allowed us to test whether it is indeed the change in
maternal investment that causes developmental constraints in the offspring.
We first tested whether offspring from the same treatment group (either
PREMS or control) differed in growth, depending on whether they were
nursed by PREMS mothers or controls. We expected PREMS mothers to invest
less during lactation and therefore lower growth rates in offspring nursed by
PREMS mothers. Then we compared only offspring that were nursed by the
same class of mothers. Since offspring classes receive the same energy supply
during lactation, we predicted that the growth rate differences between
PREMS-exposed offspring and controls match our expectation for the post-
independence rather than for the lactation period (Fig. 1).
To test whether catch-up growth could explain our results, we expected
that (i) the relative growth rates during lactation and after lactation would be
negatively correlated to offspring body sizes at birth and at weaning, re-
spectively (canalization), and (ii) accelerated postindependence growth would
not result in overshooting body size. To test these predictions, we extracted
and used all data points from the main dataset that were matched as outlined
above (see Fig. 2 D and E for sample sizes) and ran Kendall correlations.
We further controlled our results for potential publication bias. Due to the
nature of our dataset, we were unable to run effect size analyses (such as
funnel plots or conventional sensitivity analyses). We therefore reran our
main analysis with the subset of the data from studies reporting offspring
body size and/or growth as a methodological byproduct rather than a part of
a tested hypothesis (∼68% of all studies, Fig. S1 and Dataset S1, Table S1a).
For this subset, a publication bias for significant PREMS effects on offspring
growth should be negligible, because the reported PREMS effects or lack
thereof would be irrelevant for publication probability.
Results
Across studies, PREMS effects on offspring growth were largely
due to two independent effects. First, the negative effects of
PREMS on offspring growth ceased with increasing independence
and thus decreasing impact of maternal investment (effect of de-
velopmental period, Figs. 1C and 2A). As offspring progressed
from gestation (most dependence on the mother) to post-
independence (least dependence on the mother), the pro-
portion of studies reporting negative effects of PREMS on
offspring growth decreased, consistent with the developmental
constraints hypothesis (blue bars in Fig. 2B). Second, relative
growth rates were higher when the onset of PREMS occurred
during early compared with late gestation (Fig. 2 A–C), in-
dependent of the length of PREMS exposure or the length of
the recovery period. This effect of PREMS timing might reflect
a general difference in maternal investment, in which case the
effect would decrease with increasing offspring independence
(Fig. 1C). Alternatively, higher growth rates in response to
earlier compared with later PREMS exposure may result from
an early acceleration of offspring growth that would act con-
sistently throughout development (Fig. 1B). To test between
these alternatives, we assessed the statistical interaction term
between the timing of PREMS onset and developmental period
and found that this interaction term did not significantly affect
the response (P > 0.2 in all models). Thus, the effect of PREMS
timing did not change across developmental periods with
varying degrees of offspring dependence (Fig. 2B), i.e., early
PREMS exposure led to increased growth rates across all de-
velopmental stages compared with controls.
Additional models were built to assess whether the type of
manipulation used to cause PREMS affected the results. The
patterning of early and late PREMS effects remained un-
changed when limiting the analysis to nonfood stressors such as
social, heat, restraint, or predation stress; the main effects of
developmental period and PREMS onset were still significant
(Fig. S2 A and C). The developmental constraints effects were
exacerbated in studies using food restriction to elicit PREMS
(Fig. S2D interaction effects of stressor type with develop-
mental period, Fig. S2B).
The overall patterns were also similar across studies that only
manipulated maternal glucocorticoid levels without exposure to
external stressors; the main effects of PREMS onset and of de-
velopmental period remained significant when limiting the anal-
ysis to GC manipulation only (Fig. S3 A and C). External stressors
did not have an effect over and above the effect of maternal
glucocorticoids. Instead, with external stressors the timing effects
of PREMS on growth patterns were less pronounced. (Fig. S3D
interaction terms of stressor type and PREMS onset on the one
hand and developmental period on the other, Fig. S3B).
PREMS effects on offspring growth did not appear to be
caused by catch-up growth. Relative growth rates were positively,
instead of negatively, correlated with the preceding body size
both at birth [Fig. 2D; full (reduced) dataset: Kendall’s tau B =
0.415 (0.370), z = 7.13 (5.58), P < 0.001 (0.009), n = 269 (202)]
and at weaning [Fig. 2E; Kendall’s tau B = 0.243 (0.249), z = 3.42
(3.23), P < 0.001 (0.016), n = 177 (148)]. It was the large new-
borns and weanlings growing faster, not the small ones. For the
few studies that provided information on both postindependence
growth and later size, accelerated growth after PREMS did not
result in similar body size in treated and control juveniles, but
instead, treated juveniles were larger than controls (Fig. 2E;
Wilcoxon signed-rank test: V = 300, P < 0.001, n = 29).
Lastly, we focused on cross-fostering and unconstrained ar-
tificial nursing studies. When offspring from the same prenatal
treatment group were nursed by mothers from different pre-
natal treatment groups, those nursed by PREMS mothers grew
slower than those nursed by control mothers (Fig. 3A). Thus,
growth restriction during lactation was due to PREMS expo-
sure of the nursing mother, rather than the offspring’s prenatal
environment. Furthermore, if offspring from different prenatal
treatment groups were equally nursed during lactation (Fig.
3B), then differences in maternal investment should be elimi-
nated and offspring should exhibit the growth patterns found in
postindependence PREMS offspring in our main analyses (Fig.
2). To test this, we used data from cross-fostered offspring that

 were similarly nursed as reference category for developmental
phases in our main model (Fig. 3C). Indeed, the growth pat-
terns in this reference category were different from growth
patterns during lactation in offspring nursed by their birth
mothers, but not different from growth patterns after lactation
in these offspring (Fig. 3C; see also comparison between Figs.
2B and 3B). Finally, separate plots for early and late onset
PREMS indicate that PREMS offspring grew faster than con-
trols if both were nursed by the same control mothers or were
hand raised (Fig. 3B).

Effects of early vs. late gestation maternal stress on offspring growth rates during gestation, during lactation and after lactation across mammals.
Early/late gestation means first/second half of gestation. Percentage of studies reporting a higher (orange), equal (gray), or lower (blue) growth rate in
offspring from PREMS mothers compared with control mothers (relative growth rate). (A–C) For each developmental period, relative growth rates following
PREMS during the first half of gestation were higher than those following PREMS during the second half of gestation. Within this pattern, the relative growth
rate increased with increasing levels of offspring independence (developmental period). (A) In a cumulative Logit link mixed model (CLMM) (random factors:
species, within study repeated measures), relative growth rates were independently predicted by developmental period of growth measurement and ges-
tation period of PREMS onset. Length/recovery means period between onset and end of PREMS/between end of PREMS and parturition (both in percent of
gestation period). (B) PREMS effects on offspring growth following PREMS during the first half of gestation largely conformed to predictions if both de-
velopmental constraints and an adaptive growth plasticity coincide, whereas PREMS effects following PREMS during the second half of gestation largely
conformed to predictions of mere developmental constraints in the absence of an adaptive growth plasticity. (C) Presenting PREMS effects on offspring
growth depending on finer-scaled periods of PREMS onset (half gestational trimester) illustrates the difference between early and late gestation PREMS
onset. (D and E) PREMS effects on offspring growth were not due to catch-up growth in reaction to a preceding growth reduction because accelerated
offspring growth was preceded by increased rather than decreased body size at both birth and weaning, and accelerated postindependence growth led to
increased rather than unaffected juvenile body sizes.

 Discussion
In this metaanalysis including 719 studies from 388 publications
across 21 mammal species ranging across diverse taxa, we pro-
vide a comprehensive description of PREMS effects on offspring
growth. Growth differences between PREMS offspring and
controls varied with the timing of the stressor during gestation
and the developmental period assessed. Growth patterns in re-
sponse to PREMS did not differ between nutritional and other
stressors and were elicited by glucocorticoid manipulation alone.
The main limitation of our study is that all analyses had to use
the proportion of study outcomes as a response variable, because
none of the studies reported quantitative differences in growth
rates with error terms. Our approach may have masked addi-
tional variation that could be due to nonlinear effects or differ-
ences between species, sexes, and stressors, and nonsignificant
results should therefore be treated with caution. As continuous
effects become available, analyses can also be controlled for the
phylogenetic relationships between the species studied.
Our results are consistent with two opposing processes acting
on offspring growth in response to PREMS. The first process
results from developmental constraints and reduces offspring
growth, with effects diminishing as offspring becomes increasingly
independent. The second process is a single recalibration of an
offspring’s growth trajectory that initially buffers the effects of
reduced maternal investment during gestation, then fully com-
pensates for it during lactation, and, eventually, leads to
accelerated growth, overshooting an offspring’s original target
body size during juvenility. These outcomes were observed only
after PREMS exposure early but not late during gestation, sug-
gesting that a sensitive window has closed by then. Since we found
that larger, not smaller, neonates grew faster, the resulting growth
pattern is not consistent with classic catch-up growth (51–53) as
the underlying process. Instead, our results suggest developmental
plasticity in response to early PREMS with lasting effects. These
growth patterns were observed in response to a variety of stressors
and not limited to food-restriction studies. Our results also suggest
that both reduced maternal investment and the counteracting

Separating the effects of maternal investment and offspring growth plasticity: How cross-fostering and artificial nursing influences PREMS effects on
offspring growth during lactation. Percentage of studies reporting a higher (orange), equal (gray), or lower (blue) growth rate in offspring (A) nursed by or
(B) born to PREMS mothers (compared with control mothers). Early/late gestation means first/second half of gestation. (A) Pure maternal investment effect
(Fig. 1A blue path, Fig. 1C). Offspring of the same prenatal treatment group showed a significantly reduced growth rate during lactation if nursed by a PREMS
compared with a control mother. (B and C) Pure effect of offspring growth plasticity (Fig. 1A orange path, Fig. 1B). Offspring from different prenatal
treatment groups were equally nursed by mothers that did not differ from each other in their prenatal treatments. The resulting PREMS effects on offspring
growth during lactation largely conform to predictions for adaptive growth plasticity in the absence of maternal investment effects and are similar to PREMS
effects on postindependence growth (see Fig. 2 for comparison). A cumulative Logit link mixed model (CLMM) (random factors: species, within study repeated
measures) revealed that compared with PREMS effects in offspring naturally nursed by their birth mothers, the exclusion of differences in maternal in-
vestment during lactation (reference category “lactation: cross-fostered”) resulted in increased growth rates, i.e., a significant shift from PREMS effects
predicted for lactation to effects predicted for postindependence. Length/recovery means period between onset and end of PREMS/between end of PREMS
and parturition (both in percent of gestation period). *Control nursing includes both nursing by control females and artificial nursing.

 growth acceleration can be induced by elevated maternal gluco-
corticoid levels alone, even in the absence of an external stressor.
This highlights the potential role of glucocorticoids in shaping and
linking maternal investment strategies and offspring adaptive de-
velopmental plasticity (1–4, 8, 18).
In response to (expected) developmental constraints imposed
by the mother, offspring shift to a faster life history trajectory, ac-
celerating their own somatic growth. By accelerating growth, off-
spring are better able to mature quickly and to produce offspring
early and fast (15, 20, 65). Mothers gain by reserving residual re-
productive value (8, 19), and offspring gain by increasing the chance
that they reproduce at all after a bad start (20, 23, 65). This life
history pace recalibration probably comes at a cost, because energy
is allocated more to growth, maturation, and reproduction and away
from other functions such as immune function, neurodevelopment,
and cognitive function, all of which are known to be affected by
PREMS (1, 2, 4, 9, 29, 31, 63, 79). Thus, these latter functions are
jeopardized by energetic constraints caused by reduced maternal
investment and additionally by energy allocation toward somatic
growth and maturation (23, 24). Although the combined effects of
early gestation PREMS may lead to reduced fitness overall for both
mother and offspring compared with control conditions, these ef-
fects may maximize fitness for both under suboptimal early condi-
tions that cause PREMS (8, 9, 11, 16, 18, 19, 65).
A comprehensive test of our integrative hypothesis will require
lifetime fitness data from sophisticated experimental settings
that, to our knowledge, are not yet available (18, 80–82). It has
been established, however, that PREMS often is associated with
reduced offspring life span (5–7, 49, 61, 62), and that, across
vertebrates, such reduced life span correlates with accelerated
growth, maturation, reproduction, and earlier reproductive se-
nescence, suggesting an overall faster life history pace (24, 63).
As an indicator for the relevance of timing effects in mammals,
PREMS during the first half of gestation tends to result in an
earlier age at maturation without affecting body size at matu-
ration compared with controls (refs. 27, 59, and 60, but see refs.
83–85). By contrast, PREMS during the second half of gestation
generally leads to a later age at maturation (refs. 86–90, but see
refs. 91–93). Evidence for adaptive developmental plasticity in
humans comes from the Dutch hunger winter cohort. Without
considering PREMS timing, prenatal exposure to the famine
caused accelerated reproduction (ref. 58, but see ref. 94) and
cognitive aging (95). Consistent with our hypothesis, mothers’
exposure to the famine during late but not early gestation led to
reduced offspring birth weight (ref. 33, see also refs. 34 and 96,
but see ref. 97), whereas early but not late exposure altered
offspring DNA methylation of regions associated with growth
and metabolism (74). PREMS generally reduced offspring health
and life span (ref. 49, see also refs. 61 and 62), and these effects
were strongest after PREMS during the first half of gestation
(98), potentially reflecting the somatic costs of accelerated
growth (23, 24, 47, 64).
Accelerated growth has often been interpreted as a catch-up
process that is part of canalized growth (17, 19, 20, 23, 25, 47, 51–
53). Catch-up growth occurs in small-for-age offspring and can
cause constraints on other aspects of development, because more
resources are allocated to growth (17, 19, 20, 23–25, 47, 51–53).
Catch-up growth has offered a promising explanation for
PREMS effects, because PREMS often leads to reduced birth
size and reduced birth size is often associated with disadvantaged
adult phenotypes (1–3, 16, 42, 47, 99). Neither of these corre-
lations is ubiquitous, however. PREMS effects on offspring
growth are highly variable, and the long-term costs observed in
adulthood may or may not be related to reduced birth size (1, 13,
16, 17, 19, 42). Our results indicate that PREMS effects on
offspring growth do not generally involve classic catch-up growth
in a large sample across mammals.
To recalibrate offspring phenotype to accelerated growth and
faster life history, it seems necessary that PREMS occurs during
a critical period that is limited to early gestation. Late gestation
PREMS not only fails to initiate a life history recalibration, but
even seems to prevent the offspring from enlisting catch-up
growth. Such timing effects can be explained by a general de-
crease of fetal plasticity with increasing age (1, 9, 19, 42),
changing effects of PREMS on the placenta (42), changes in the
interplay between maternal and fetal glucocorticoid metabolism
(3), or changes in fetal glucocorticoid sensitivity (3). Thus, more
work on the mechanisms underlying timing effects, together with
research on the consequences of PREMS for different aspects of
life history, including maturation, reproductive rate, and lon-
gevity, as well as studies spanning different sensitive periods in
ontogeny where PREMS effects may be modified, and work on
the interplay of PREMS and maternal investment will advance
our understanding of the interplay of developmental constraints
and adaptive developmental plasticity.
