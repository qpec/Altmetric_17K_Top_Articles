Context: Obesity is a major health concern in the United States, and its prevalence
continues to rise. Although it is a common health issue, many people, including
health care professionals, are biased against people with obesity.
Objective: To determine whether a comprehensive obesity curriculum presented to
students in medical school can positively influence their attitudes toward obesity.
Methods: The study was designed around a comprehensive educational obesity
curriculum at Touro University College of Osteopathic Medicine-CA, involving the
classes of 2013 through 2018. A survey to assess student attitudes toward obesity was
distributed to first-year students before the curriculum, directly after completion, and
each year after until graduation (graduating classes of 2015 through 2018). Second-
and third-year medical students in 2011 (graduating classes of 2014 and 2013), who
did not complete the curriculum, were given an examination to establish baseline
values and served as the control group. The obesity curriculum consisted of lectures
delivered during the first and second year of medical school and case study simulations
during the third year. Knowledge gained from the curriculum was assessed with a
multiple-choice examination, and bias was assessed using the Fat Phobia Scale.
Results: A total of 718 first- through fourth-year students were included. Students
who completed the first year of the obesity curriculum (n=528) showed significantly
greater medical knowledge regarding obesity-related epidemiology, pathogenesis,
biochemistry, pathophysiology, and metabolic factors; nutrition, diet, physical activ-
ity, self-control, and behavior modification; pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic
interventions; and associated chronic disorders, based on their multiple-choice
examination scores compared with the control group. The examination scores indi-
cated significant increases in medical knowledge compared with the precurriculum
cohort after the curriculum (OMS I students: 130 [72.4%]; 133 [92.6%]; 133
[91.1%]; 132 [89.0%]; vs control: 105 [47.2%]; 134 [52.6%], respectively
[P<.01]). In all 4 years observed, there was a significant reduction in bias among
first-year medical students after obesity curriculum (before: 3.65, 3.76, 3.57, 3.61,
and after: 3.47, 3.38, 3.34, 3.37, respectively) (P<.05). The reduction in bias was
also significantly sustained throughout the fourth year.
Conclusion: A comprehensive obesity curriculum throughout medical school
resulted in an improvement in students’ attitudes toward and knowledge of obesity.

 T
he prevalence of obesity in the United States
continues to rise even though the government
has prioritized obesity as a major health
concern.1,2 Concurrent with the rise in obesity is the
stigmatization of people with obesity.3 Long-standing
stereotypes of overweight and obese individuals,
including an association with lesser intelligence,
sexual unattractiveness, laziness, lack of will power,
and gluttony remain prevalent.4-6 Furthermore, many
studies7,8 have demonstrated that this bias against
people with obesity is also present in health care profes-
sionals. Health care professionals with negative atti-
tudes toward patients with obesity may not have
successful communication with patients, which can
result in less preventive care, more emergent care,
avoidance of initiating a discussion about obesity, and
the potential to create an environment that results in
worse eating behaviors for the patient.15,19-26
Medical students, both osteopathic and allopathic,
have been found to share a similar bias, whether impli-
cit or explicit, against people with obesity.27,28
Furthermore, negative comments or discriminatory
behavior toward patients with obesity by faculty or
staff may influence the attitudes of students toward
these patients.16,19,29-31
To address this issue of bias against obesity, many
medical schools have incorporated obesity-related
behavioral medicine didactics, motivational interview
training, and interprofessional learning activities into
their curriculum.28,32-36 However, few prospective
studies28,33,37,38 have examined the effect of these
programs on students’ attitudes toward obesity.
Medical students are aware of multiple causes of
obesity; however, their perception of these causes
varies considerably.15 O’Brien et al39 compared a cur-
riculum that emphasized controllable causes of obesity,
such as diet and exercise, with a curriculum that empha-
sized both controllable and uncontrollable causes of
obesity, such as genetics and environment, and con-
cluded that there was an increased bias toward obesity
in the students who were taught only the controllable
causes of obesity. To our knowledge, no study to date
has demonstrated a sustainable decrease in bias caused
by a program in any health sciences school, nor has
any study proved a change in bias to be caused by a
deeper understanding of the multiple factors complicit
in the obesity epidemic.
The purpose of this study was to determine whether a
comprehensive obesity curriculum could increase
obesity knowledge and positively influence the atti-
tudes of students at Touro University College of
Osteopathic Medicine-CA (TUCOM) toward people
with obesity. We hypothesized that a comprehensive
obesity-specific curriculum designed to increase knowl-
edge regarding obesity would have a positive effect on
students’ bias toward these patients.
Methods
The obesity curriculum at TUCOM was initiated in
2011 and represents a modified version of a curriculum
developed by Katz et al.8 Students in the classes of
2013 through 2018 at TUCOM were included.
Although the curriculum was slightly altered each
year, it always consisted of a survey to assess bias
against obesity before and after the curriculum, inform-
ative lectures, a postcurriculum multiple-choice exam-
ination to assess knowledge gained from the lectures,
and interactive case study simulations. The institutional
review board determined that this project was exempt,
and informed consent was implied by completion of
the survey.
Survey
The survey was based on the modified Fat Phobia
Scale.9 The 14 adjective pairs used in the scale describ-
ing obese and normal-weight people have been used to
establish bias baselines in previous health care provider
groups, including family physicians, dietician students,
physician assistant students, and registered nurses.9-13
Using a 5-point Likert scale, students were instructed
to indicate which adjective better fit their perception of
a person with obesity (eg, lazy [5] vs industrious [1]).
Scores were calculated using the method described in

 Bacon et al,9 and a comparison between events was
determined using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test with a
statistical significance of P<.05. Higher total scores
represented more biased, negative attitudes toward
people with obesity. Survey responses were collected
from
Blackboard
course
management
software
(Blackboard Inc), which was later replaced by an
online survey tool (Qualtrics LLC). All first-year stu-
dents completed a survey before receiving any formal
education related to obesity to determine their baseline
level of bias against obesity. Students were also asked
to complete the survey after their first year of the cur-
riculum and then once during the second half of their
second, third, and fourth years of medical school. All
survey data were collected anonymously, and only
pooled average data were used per class.
Curriculum and Examination
First Year, Class of 2015
First-year students attended lectures covering various
topics relating to obesity (ie, epidemiology; pathogen-
esis and metabolic factors; nutrition, diet, and physical
activity;
self-control
and
behavior
modification;
pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic management
interventions; and associated chronic diseases). After
the 5-hour curriculum, first-year students received
a 14-item multiple-choice obesity examination pro-
vided during a larger midterm examination to assess
knowledge gained.
First Year, Classes of 2016, 2017, and 2018
It was determined that the first-year material used for
the class of 2015 was too extensive to cover in 5
hours, so the curriculum was increased to 6 hours
for the first-year classes of 2016 through 2018. The
multiple-choice examination was increased to 30
questions and given to students in a stand-alone
examination, which contained 10 optimal perform-
ing items from the previous version based on
item
analysis
(difficulty
rating,
discriminating
index, and point biserials) along with 20 additional
questions.
Second Year
For second-year students in the class of 2015, the cur-
riculum consisted of 3 hours of course material, which
provided updated information based on new reviewed
data over the previous year, reemphasized selected
obesity topics, and included the following 2 additional
topics: (1) the interaction through subclinical inflamma-
tion between obesity, metabolic abnormalities, and
environmental change; and (2) a distinctive osteopathic
approach to managing obesity. For second-year stu-
dents in the classes of 2016 through 2018, the curricu-
lar materials were deemed too dense for 3 hours, and
the curriculum was increased to 4 hours. Students
in the classes of 2015 through 2017 received a
25-question multiple-choice obesity examination.
Third Year
For third-year students, the curriculum included virtual
patient case presentations using MedU (http://www
.med-u.org), with supporting resources and formative
assessment
tools
covering
obesity-related
issues
encountered in core clinical rotations in family medi-
cine, internal medicine, obstetrics and gynecology, pedi-
atrics, and surgery. MedU cases are online interactive
patient presentations through which students can prac-
tice the process of history taking, physical examinations,
and clinical reasoning skills. Embedded in each case are
teaching points, which may link to resources outside
MedU or offer explanations within the program.
Third-year students were also assigned reading materials
regarding
the
American
College
of
Cardiology/
American Heart Association guidelines pertaining to
obesity, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute’s
research on obesity, healthy eating for children, and
other related topics, such as metabolic syndrome.
Fourth Year
There was no educational intervention for fourth-year
students, but students did take the survey to determine
whether the curriculum taken in previous years contin-
ued to have the same effect on the students’ attitudes
toward obesity.

 Control Group
The classes of 2013 and 2014 (second- and third-year
students, respectively) were surveyed, although they
did not receive the comprehensive obesity curriculum,
to provide a secondary control group. These students
did attend 2 to 3 hours of cumulative lectures on
various topics (eg, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes
mellitus, obstructive sleep apnea, infertility, nutrition,
diet) and how they related to obesity. These students
also took the multiple-choice examination that was
given to the class of 2015, except that the examination
for the class of 2013 had only 13 questions.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical significance was measured using SPSS soft-
ware. The statistical significance comparing the differ-
ence between knowledge acquired before and after the
comprehensive obesity curriculum was determined
using the t test. Statistical significance between the
FPS scores was calculated using the Wilcoxon
signed-rank test. A P value of less than .05 was consid-
ered statistically significant.
Results
Results were obtained from 718 first- through fourth-
year students in the graduating classes of 2013
through 2018 at TUCOM. All students were asked
to participate, and student participation exceeded
90%. All completed surveys were included in the
analysis.
For students who took the 13- or 14-question obesity
examination, the first-year students in the class of 2015
scored significantly higher than the classes of 2013 and
2014 (72.4% vs 47.2% and 52.6%, respectively;
P<.01). Students in the classes of 2016 through 2018
scored a mean (SD) of at least 89.0% (2.8%) on the
30-item obesity examination. Examination scores are
provided in Table 1 and Figure 1.
The mean (SD) survey score of the students who had
not yet completed the obesity curriculum (classes of
2013 and 2014) was 3.64 (0.1) (P<.01). This value
was compared with the mean (SD) score of first-year
students (n=502) who completed the curriculum (class
of 2015-2018), which was 3.39 (0.05) (P<.01), indicat-
ing a statistically significant decrease (Table 2).
Figure 2 illustrates all available survey scores for the
classes of 2015 through 2018.
Discussion
After the failure to achieve the Healthy People 2010
goals in reducing obesity, the American Osteopathic
Association’s house of delegates passed Resolution
435A in 2011, which stipulated that all osteopathic
physicians should address the obesity epidemic in their
practice. In 2011, TUCOM’s comprehensive obesity
curriculum was implemented with the aim to decrease
student bias against obesity and, by extension, change
new physician behavior in treating patients with
obesity.
The participants in the current study who did not
receive the obesity curriculum significantly underper-
formed on the multiple-choice examination compared
with the participants who received the curriculum,
demonstrating their lack of knowledge on the topic
of obesity. The relatively high scores of students
who received the curriculum suggest that students
learned from the content taught in the curriculum.
Concomitant with this increase in knowledge was a
significant decrease in bias toward obesity, as indi-
cated by the decrease in survey scores. By spanning
the informational aspect of the program over medical
school years 1 through 3, this decreased bias was sus-
tained during all 4 years of medical school (for those
students who had 3 years of the curriculum, classes
2015 and 2016). To our knowledge, this is the first
study to demonstrate a sustained 4-year decrease in
obesity bias.
The current data suggest that providing a comprehen-
sive obesity-related curriculum that includes biologic,
psychosocial, epidemiologic, pathologic, and clinical
aspects to medical students is vital to reducing bias
against obesity and can better prepare them to address

 the concerns of their patients with obesity. In addition,
to our knowledge, TUCOM’s obesity curriculum is the
first to include information on health disparities and
ethnic differences. The curriculum also included the
important topic of climate change as it relates to the
obesity epidemic, which included teaching students the
global burden of disease attributable to the interaction
between obesity, metabolic syndrome, and climate
change/air pollution, which conforms to the recent
American College of Physicians40 position paper on
climate change and health.
Limitations of the study include the use of only 1
tool to measure the level of bias toward obesity (ie, the
survey). Other surveys are available to measure both

 intrinsic and extrinsic bias, which could have been
used.31 Further research is needed to determine
whether there is a measurable difference in the type of
bias that students have against obesity (ie, intrinsic or
extrinsic). Another limitation to this study is inherent
in the use of a single-arm study design and the fact
that the students involved were all from a single institu-
tion. The small reduction in bias, although statistically
significant, still means that bias is present. Whether
this improvement will be clinically relevant has yet to
be determined.
This study only addressed student bias toward
obesity. It has yet to be determined if this reduction in
bias can be maintained in their medical practice and if

 it will translate into better patient care. It is possible that
as medical students progress through their clinical train-
ing, increased exposure to the clinical components of
obesity may be countered by the greater exposure to
bias from their health care team as they interact with
patients with obesity. This concept will be further
explored in the next study phase. No existing curricu-
lum had been replaced by the obesity curriculum at
TUCOM, which added less than a 3% increase in
material provided during the semester.
In phase 2 of this study, we intend to determine
whether electronic-learning modules developed to
provide content addressed in the obesity curriculum
can achieve a similar reduction in bias at other medical
schools. Phase 3 will then modify the curriculum to
align with the specific residency specialty programs
and extend it to residents in continuity of care clinics
to determine whether the improved knowledge and
change in attitude will result in better clinical outcomes
for their overweight and obese patients.
Conclusion
Studies have demonstrated that health care profes-
sionals may have an inherent bias against patients
with obesity.10-13 This bias imposes a considerable
barrier in attaining positive clinical outcomes when
evaluating
and
treating
these
patients.20-25
The
current study demonstrated that improving a medical
student’s basic knowledge of obesity can improve
any obesity-related bias. Further evaluation is neces-
sary to determine whether this curriculum can be
reproduced with similar results at other osteopathic
or allopathic medical schools. Changing attitudes
and beliefs may translate into improved changes in
behavior and ultimately result in improved clinical
outcomes.
