Abstract
 Importance—Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening for prostate cancer is controversial. 
Experts have suggested more personalized or more conservative strategies to improve benefit-risk 
tradeoffs, but the value of these strategies—particularly when combined with increased 
conservative management for low-risk cases—is uncertain.
 Objective—To evaluate the potential cost-effectiveness of plausible PSA screening strategies, 
and to assess the value added by increased use of conservative management among low-risk 
screen-detected cases.
 Design—Micro-simulation model of prostate cancer incidence and mortality under alternative 
PSA screening strategies and either (1) “contemporary” treatment practices based on age, stage, 
and grade observed in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program in 2010 or (2) 
“selective” treatment practices where cases with Gleason sum <7 and clinical T-stage ≤T2a are 
treated only after clinical progression and all others are treated according to “contemporary” 
treatment practices.

  Setting—National and trial data on PSA growth, screening and biopsy patterns, incidence, 
treatment distributions, treatment efficacy, mortality, health-related quality of life, and direct 
medical expenditure.
 Participants—A simulated contemporary cohort of U.S. men beginning at 40 years of age.
 Interventions—18 screening strategies that vary by start and stop age, screening interval, and 
criteria for biopsy referral; “contemporary” or “selective” treatment practices.
 Main Outcome Measures—Life years (LYs), quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), direct 
medical expenditure, and cost per LY and QALY gained.
 Results—All screening strategies increased LYs (range 0.03–0.06) and costs ($300–$1,400) 
vs. no screening with cost per LY ranging from $7,300 to $21,600. With “contemporary” 
treatment, only strategies with biopsy referral when PSA >10.0 µg/L or age-dependent thresholds 
increased QALYs (0.002–0.004), and only quadrennial screening of ages 55–69 was potentially 
cost-effective in terms of cost per QALY (ICER=$92,400). With “selective” treatment, all 
strategies increased QALYs (0.002–0.004) and several strategies were potentially cost-effective in 
terms of cost per QALY (ICER=$70,800–$136,300).
 Conclusions—For PSA screening to be cost effective it needs to be used conservatively and 
ideally in combination with a conservative management approach for low-risk disease.

 INTRODUCTION
With the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation against routine 
prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening1, and conservative guidance from other national 
panels2–4, the future of PSA screening is uncertain. The recently updated guidelines relied 
heavily on results from two large trials conducted in the U.S. and Europe5–7. These results 
have been interpreted by some as demonstrating that PSA screening provides at most modest 
benefit, with unacceptable costs in terms of overdiagnosis and overtreatment8,9. However, 
over a long-term horizon, the lives saved by screening are likely to be considerably higher, 
and the fraction overdiagnosed considerably lower compared with the trials10–13. Rather 
than rejecting screening, we have recommended seeking more personalized (or “smarter”) 
screening strategies that preserve benefit while reducing harms13,14. Unfortunately, these 
strategies are unlikely to be evaluated in randomized trials due to resource and logistical 
constraints. Therefore, we have used modeling to conduct simulated comparisons of 
candidate screening approaches.
In a recent study15, we projected outcomes for a contemporary cohort of U.S. men using 35 
screening strategies that varied by screening ages, inter-screening intervals, and criteria for 
biopsy referral. We identified several strategies that reduced screening harms by more than 
half yet retained the majority of lives saved relative to a “reference” annual screening 
strategy for men aged 50–74 years. These “smarter” strategies used longer inter-screening

 intervals and more conservative criteria for biopsy referral in older men. Other investigators 
have also proposed screening policies with similar objectives, including: stopping screening 
at age 60 if PSA <1.0 µg/L16, using baseline PSA at age 45–50 to identify men appropriate 
for less frequent screening17, and referring to biopsy only when PSA >10.0 µg/L9. However, 
no studies to date have evaluated how these strategies alter the benefit-risk balance of PSA 
screening, or if they represent high-value alternatives to no screening18.
Beyond “smarter” screening strategies, there is growing support for more selective treatment 
strategies. Active surveillance, which manages newly diagnosed patients conservatively with 
serial biopsies, is an increasingly common approach19–21 for treating low-risk cases—which 
constitute the majority of newly diagnosed prostate cancers. However, few studies have 
projected screening outcomes under alternative treatment practices.
The primary objective of this modeling study is to investigate whether “smarter” PSA 
prostate cancer screening strategies have the potential to be effective and cost-effective 
relative to no screening. Additionally, we investigate the potential added value of combining 
screening and treatment strategies by also projecting outcomes under “selective” treatment 
practices with increased use of conservative management among men with screen-detected 
low-risk disease.
 METHODS
 Overview
The Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC) micro-simulation model of prostate 
cancer (summarized in the Supplement) was developed as part of the National Cancer 
Institute’s Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network (CISNET) prostate 
cancer working group22. The model is unique among prostate cancer models because it 
explicitly links cancer progression with individual PSA growth. This link is critical for 
evaluating screening strategies with PSA-dependent criteria for biopsy referral, inter-
screening intervals, and/or early cessation. The model has been fit to U.S. incidence data 
(eFigure 1 in the Supplement), and has been used to study population incidence and 
mortality trends23 and evaluate the comparative effectiveness of alternative PSA screening 
policies15.
We expanded the FHCRC model to estimate quality-adjusted survival and costs for 
coordinated screening and treatment strategies from a U.S. healthcare payer perspective. For 
each strategy, the model simulated a cohort of men beginning at age 40 and projected 
prostate cancer outcomes over a lifetime horizon. We calculated outcomes using health state 
utility and cost weights applied to the person-years tallied in the healthy state and in the 
post-diagnosis states (eFigure 2 in the Supplement). Costs and survival outcomes were 
discounted at 3% per year in the base case, and cost outcomes are presented in 2014 USD. 
This modeling study was exempt from human subjects review.

 Cancer Network recommendations (Strategy 2)24, the American Urologic Association 
guidelines statement (Strategy 14)2, and the commonest protocol used in the European 
Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (Strategy 15)25. We also consider 
strategies that use a high PSA threshold (i.e., 10.0 µg/L) for referral to biopsy (Strategies 3–
4, 9–12, and 16–18)—a value that would mandate a biopsy recommendation. Supplementing 
this selection, we also evaluated the cost-effectiveness of the superset of screening strategies 
comprising all 150 combinations of starting ages 45, 50, and 55; cessation ages 69 and 74; 
inter-screening intervals 1, 2, and 4 years and two PSA-dependent intervals (explained in the 
Supplement); and PSA threshold 3.0, 4.0, and 10.0 µg/L and two age-dependent PSA 
thresholds (explained in the Supplement).
 Survival model
In the absence of screening and curative treatment, prostate cancer survival is based on 
observed survival for untreated cases diagnosed in SEER in 1983–1986, just before the PSA 
era. Frequencies of curative surgery and/or radiation are based on SEER trends by age, 
stage, and grade at diagnosis, and frequencies of adjuvant hormone use are based on patterns 
observed in the Cancer of the Prostate Strategic Urologic Research Endeavor (CaPSURE) 
database26. Effects of curative treatment are based on the Scandinavian randomized trial of 
prostatectomy vs. watchful waiting (HR=0.62)27 and assuming similar efficacy for 
contemporary radiation therapy28,29.
The model represents the effect of early detection on prostate cancer survival by assuming 
that would-be metastatic cases screen-detected at a local-regional stage have their survival 
changed to that associated with detection at the earlier stage. We previously showed that this 
effect is consistent with the published 21% mortality reduction reported in ERSPC14,15. 
Although the results of the U.S. Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian cancer screening 
trial14,30,31 did not show a reduction in the screen arm, we showed that the extensive control 
arm contamination suggests that a mortality benefit of this magnitude cannot be ruled out30.
In this study, the model was extended to track time spent in pre- and post-diagnosis states, 
including short- and long-term disease management states after receipt of curative treatment, 
a “no curative treatment” state for individuals not receiving curative treatment, and a two-
year end-of-life state for men who die of prostate cancer. Cases with low-risk disease 
detected by screening may defer therapy until they progress to a point at which their disease 
would have become clinically apparent in the absence of screening. The Supplement 
summarizes health state definitions and durations.
 “Contemporary” and “selective” treatment practices
We consider two initial treatment scenarios. Under “contemporary” treatment practices, all 
cases receive curative treatment (prostatectomy or radiation therapy, with or without 
androgen deprivation therapy) based on the frequencies of treatment observed in the SEER 
program in the year 2010 by age, stage, and grade. We do not model the small proportion of 
localized cases who receive androgen deprivation therapy alone. In contrast, under 
“selective” treatment practices, screen-detected cases with Gleason score <7 and clinical T-
stage ≤T2a disease initially receive conservative management and all other cases receive the

 same treatments as under “contemporary” treatment practices. The Supplement describes 
extensions to the FHCRC model to identify cases eligible for conservative management and 
frequencies of immediate primary treatments (eTable 1).
We model a conservative management program in which curative treatment is offered once 
cases progress to the point of would-be clinical diagnosis in the absence of screening. 
Consequently, only non-overdiagnosed cases receive delayed curative treatment. This 
conservative version of active surveillance (AS) is modeled because there is no consensus 
around the appropriate conduct of AS, and the timing of progression to treatment under AS 
is therefore unclear. Further, the endpoint of would-be clinical diagnosis in the absence of 
screening is generated by the FHCRC model. We believe this represents a useful benchmark 
for comparison but acknowledge that under most contemporary AS approaches, curative 
therapy would likely be offered at an earlier time point.
 Health-related quality of life and costs
Few studies have produced estimates of health state utilities for prostate cancer and its 
treatment. The health state utility for men without prostate cancer diagnosis was assumed to 
be 1.0 to represent full health. All other health state utilities were extracted from a prior U.S. 
study of 162 men aged ≥60 years or older that used standard gamble to elicit preferences for 
19 prostate cancer health states (Table 1)32. Note that the short-term treatment health state 
utility decrement was applied for one year to localized cases receiving prostatectomy or 
radiation therapy, and reflects a weighted average of patients with and without major 
treatment side effects.
We obtained cost estimates related to PSA testing, office visits, and conservative 
management by micro-costing resource use with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid 
Services 2014 reimbursement schedule33. Costs for surgical treatment and radiation therapy 
episodes were derived from a prior SEER-Medicare analysis that calculated the mean 
procedure-attributable cost for patients receiving either type of treatment34. Biopsy, distant 
stage initial treatment (one-time), long-term management, end-of-life, and treatment 
complication costs were derived from prior economic analyses in prostate cancer (Table 
1)28,35–37. Treatment complication costs were applied to 12.5% and 4.2% of men receiving 
prostatectomy and radiation therapy, respectively, based on the rates of Grade 3/4 
complications in a prior analysis.28 Cost inputs were adjusted using the medical care 
component of the consumer price index to 2014 USD38.
 Model outcomes
We used the model to calculate prostate cancer diagnosis, treatment, death, unadjusted life 
years, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and cost for each screening strategy. The 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated as the ratio of the difference in 
costs between strategies to the difference in effects (e.g., QALYs) between strategies38.
We calculated probabilistic outcomes using Monte Carlo simulation and conducted one-way 
sensitivity analyses to determine the inputs with the greatest influence on incremental QALY 
and cost outcomes39.

 Cost-effectiveness was evaluated at willingness-to-pay thresholds ranging from $50,000 to 
$150,000 per QALY40–44. This range reflects the implied willingness-to-pay for cancer 
treatments in the U.S. and is consistent with values used in prior analyses40,44–46.
 RESULTS
 “Contemporary” treatment practices
Table 2 displays the results under “contemporary” treatment practices. Among the 18 
screening strategies evaluated, all increased life years (range=0.03–0.06) compared with no 
screening, but only strategies with biopsy threshold at PSA >10.0 µg/L increased QALYs 
(range=0.002–0.004). Among this subset of strategies, cost per life year ranged from 
$12,000 to $21,000. Only quadrennial screening of ages 55–69 with a biopsy threshold at 
PSA >10.0 µg/L (Strategy 18) was potentially cost-effective in terms of cost per QALY 
($92,446/QALY).
Corresponding results for the superset of screening strategies show that our selection of 
promising and policy-relevant strategies is representative of the range of cost-effectiveness 
outcomes (eFigure 3 in the Supplement). In general, only a small number of conservative 
screening strategies (4% of the superset) similar to those presented in Table 2 were 
potentially cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay of $150,000 or less per QALY.
 “Selective” treatment practices
“Selective” treatment practices were implemented only for strategies with PSA thresholds 
below 10.0 µg/L because prostate cancer cases diagnosed with PSA >10.0 µg/L would not 
typically qualify as “low-risk” or candidates for delayed curative treatment. Among the 10 
screening strategies evaluated (Table 2), Strategies 8, 14, and 15 compared most favorably 
with no screening, resulting in 0.041, 0.046, and 0.036 more life years, 0.004, 0.003, and 
0.004 more QALYs, and $353, $397, and $262 greater cost, respectively. All of these 
strategies have an inter-screening interval of 2–4 years with PSA biopsy thresholds of 4.0, 
3.0, and 3.0 µg/L; the ICERs for these strategies were $8,622, $7,335, and $8,600 per life 
year gained and $89,333, $70,831, and $120,952 per QALY gained, respectively.
Results for the superset of screening strategies with “selective” treatment practices, 
including those with biopsy threshold at PSA >10.0 µg/L, show that a large proportion of the 
strategies are potentially cost-effective at willingness-to-pay levels of $100,000 (43% of the 
superset) and $150,000 (70% of the superset) per QALY (eFigure 3 in the Supplement). The 
most cost-effective strategies in the superset are similar to the most cost-effective strategies 
in Table 2.
 Sensitivity analysis
One-way sensitivity analyses focused on QALYs demonstrated that results were by far most 
sensitive to the health state utility in the conservative management state. One-way sensitivity 
analyses evaluating cost differences were most sensitive to the costs of prostate cancer death, 
radiation therapy, and PSA testing. All analyses were conditional on the assumed efficacy of 
curative treatment.

 Under “contemporary” treatment practices, the probabilistic sensitivity analysis 
demonstrated a low probability of PSA screening cost-effectiveness at willingness-to-pay 
levels at or below $100,000 per QALY (Figure 2A). Only quadrennial screening of men age 
55–69 with a PSA biopsy threshold of 10.0 µg/L had greater than a 50% probability of being 
potentially cost-effective at willingness-to-pay of $100,000 and $150,000 per QALY (Figure 
2).
Under “selective” treatment practices, the probabilistic sensitivity analysis demonstrated that 
no strategies had a greater than 50% probability of being cost-effective at a willingness-to-
pay of $50,000 per QALY, and only quadrennial screening of men age 55–69 with a PSA 
biopsy threshold of 3.0 µg/L (Strategy 15) and quadrennial screening of men age 50–74 with 
a PSA biopsy threshold of 4.0 µg/L (Strategy 8) had greater than a 50% probability of being 
potentially cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay of $100,000 per QALY (Figure 2). Several 
other relatively conservative strategies (7, 10, 13, and 14) were potentially cost-effective at a 
willingness-to-pay of $150,000 per QALY (Figure 2).
 DISCUSSION
The value of PSA screening for prostate cancer is uncertain, as reflected by variable clinical 
guidelines. This study provides the first quantitative framework to evaluate the comparative 
effectiveness of PSA-based screening strategies and selective treatment approaches, and it 
addresses an urgent need for direction concerning the future of PSA screening in the U.S. 
Our work indicates strategies with conservative screening frequency (e.g., quadrennial) 
and/or a higher PSA biopsy threshold (e.g., 4.0 µg/L) are potentially cost-effective when 
combined with increased use of conservative management for low-risk cases, but are 
unlikely to be cost-effective under contemporary treatment practices.
Our findings have clear implications for the future of PSA screening in the U.S. Rather than 
stopping PSA screening, as recommended by the USPSTF, implementation of strategies that 
extend the inter-screening interval and/or utilize higher PSA biopsy thresholds have the 
potential to preserve substantial benefit while controlling harm and costs. Though higher-
threshold policies (e.g., 10.0 µg/L) are unlikely to be clinically appealing, they reinforce the 
general conclusion that conservative patterns of screening and biopsy referral are important 
directions to consider if PSA screening is to be both clinically effective and cost-effective.
All strategies evaluated were potentially cost-effective in terms of cost per life year (range=
$7,300–$21,600). However, that metric ignores the important health-related quality of life 
impacts of cancer diagnosis, treatment, and associated complications. For this reason, our 
primary analysis evaluated the impacts of PSA screening in terms of cost per QALY. In 
analyses with “contemporary” treatment practices, we demonstrated that only strategies with 
highly conservative PSA biopsy thresholds (i.e., 10.0 µg/L) are expected to increase QALYs 
relative to no screening, and among those strategies only the most conservative (quadrennial 
screening of ages 55–69) was potentially cost-effective.
The contrasting cost-effectiveness results of the “contemporary” vs. “selective” treatment 
practices demonstrates the importance of conservative management of low-risk prostate

 cancer and the potential for increased use of active surveillance to make the benefit-risk 
tradeoffs and cost-effectiveness of screening acceptable. For example, quadrennial screening 
of men age 55–69 with biopsy threshold at 3.0 µg/L (Strategy 15) and quadrennial screening 
of men age 50–74 with biopsy threshold at 4.0 µg/L (Strategy 8) were both dominated under 
“contemporary” treatment practices but had ICERs of $89,300 and $70,800 per QALY under 
“selective” treatment practices, respectively. These favorable results in the “selective” 
treatment scenario are due to low-risk men on conservative management having better 
health-related quality of life, lower cost, and similar survival compared with low-risk men 
who receive immediate curative treatment. Additionally, we observed in the supplemental 
analysis of the superset of 150 screening strategies that the high PSA biopsy threshold (e.g., 
10.0 µg/L) found to be favorable under “contemporary” treatments has similar value under 
“selective” treatments because men diagnosed with high PSA are more promising candidates 
for immediate treatment47 and are generally ineligible for surveillance programs.
There has been substantial discussion of the need for cost-effectiveness analyses exploring 
emerging PSA screening strategies, but few such studies have been reported in the 
literature48,49. A recent study used another CISNET micro-simulation model to evaluate the 
cost-effectiveness of a range of screening strategies in a European setting50. Their most cost-
effective strategy screened men ages 55–59 at 2-year intervals, which is consistent with our 
conclusions that conservative use of the test is imperative. The authors concluded that 
shorter inter-screening intervals are more cost-effective than longer intervals when they 
examined strategies with cessation around age 60. In contrast, when they examined 
strategies with higher cessation ages, they found that longer screening intervals were more 
cost-effective. For example, quadrennial screening to age 69 or 74 achieved much lower 
additional costs but similar QALYs gained compared to biennial or annual screening (Figure 
2B in that study). It should be noted that their model reflects a European setting with very 
different costs for many services, and with a lower frequency of curative treatments relative 
to the U.S. Additionally, several post-diagnosis utility values (e.g., active surveillance=0.97 
and 1 year after initial primary treatment=0.95) were more favorable than ours (0.92 for both 
states). Nevertheless, despite these differences, and differences in how the two models 
represent and estimate prostate cancer natural history5152, there is broad agreement between 
their study and ours that only a highly conservative PSA screening strategy will be cost-
effective.
This analysis has several limitations that should be noted. First, this is a micro-simulation 
study that uses the best available evidence to project the comparative effectiveness of PSA 
screening strategies vs. no screening. Ideally, the comparative effectiveness of the PSA 
screening strategies would be evaluated head-to-head in “real world” settings prior to 
implementation. However, this is unlikely given the resource demands and complexity of 
designing studies to evaluate dozens of screening strategies. As a result, rigorously 
developed and validated disease models play an important role in projecting the comparative 
effectiveness of alternative PSA screening strategies. Nonetheless, our model evaluates a 
long-term time horizon, and there like to be is increasing uncertainty around model-
projected results over time.

 Few studies have elicited health state utilities for the PSA screening, making cost-
effectiveness analyses challenging in this setting. As a result, we assume equivalence 
between several health states and those noted in prior studies (e.g., our conservative 
management utility was assumed to be equivalent to that of prostate cancer patients with a 
20% chance of cancer spread not currently receiving treatment)53. However, we do allow a 
fraction of those cases to later receive curative treatment, and their utilities are modified 
accordingly at that time. We do not model the health-related quality of life impacts of 
biopsies. Neither do we model the impact of an elevated PSA (say 4.0 µg/L) that is still 
below the threshold for biopsy referral (say 10.0 µg/L) owing to a lack of data in this setting. 
Further, our analysis does not reflect the substantial costs of several recently approved 
systemic treatments for advanced prostate cancer. To the extent that screening reduces 
metastasis and castrate resistance, inclusion of these new treatments could improve 
screening cost-effectiveness outcomes relative to those projected in this study. Our previous 
studies have discussed other technical limitations of the FHCRC model15.
We recognize that the modeled conservative management program in the “selective” 
treatment scenario reflects a highly conservative approach to active surveillance. There is not 
a standard protocol for active surveillance, but most contemporary programs would likely 
identify and treat progressive cases before they progressed to clinically detected disease 
(when cases are treated in the model). Thus, the “selective” treatment scenario results might 
underestimate survival and costs compared with contemporary active surveillance protocols.
In conclusion, our work adds to a growing consensus50,54,55 that highly conservative use of 
the PSA test and biopsy referral is necessary if PSA screening is to be cost-effective. Among 
the strategies considered, less frequent screening and more restrictive criteria for biopsy 
resulted in greater chances of PSA screening being cost-effective—particularly when 
combined with “selective” treatment strategies that do not immediately treat low-risk screen-
detected cases.

 Figure 1. Candidate PSA screening strategies
Strategies were suggested by published screening studies, approximation to a trial protocol, 
approximation to a clinical recommendation statement from a national organization, or a 
combination of sources. All strategies are compared to no screening.
NCCN=National Comprehensive Cancer Network
ERSPC=European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer
AUA=American Urological Association
PSA1-dependent screening interval is every 1 year if PSA >3.0 µg/L and every 2 years 
otherwise.
PSA2-dependent screening interval is every 2 years if PSA >1.0 µg/L and every 4 years 
otherwise.
Age1-dependent PSA thresholds for biopsy referral are 3.5, 4.5, and 6.5 µg/L for ages 50–
59, 60–69, and 70–74 y.
Age2-dependent PSA thresholds for biopsy referral are 4.5, 5.5, and 8.5 µg/L for ages 50–
59, 60–69, and 70–74 y.
HT=high threshold

 Figure 2. 
Cost-effectiveness acceptability results for the “contemporary” and “selective” 
treatment scenarios at willingness to pay levels of $50,000–$150,000 per quality-
adjusted life year gained. The strategy numbers relate to the strategies in Table 2. The 
percentages noted in the figure relate to the proportion of simulation runs in which the 
cost per quality-adjusted life year was less than or equal to the given willingness to pay. 
We do not report results for strategies with PSA threshold for biopsy of 10.0 µg/L in the 
“selective” treatment scenario because cases detected by screening are unlikely candidates 
for conservative management with delayed curative treatment.

&The “distant stage initial treatment cost” was a one-time cost of initial treatment applied to men diagnosed with distant stage disease. The “distant stage management cost” reflects the ongoing cost of care 
in the distant stage state and was applied to all years in that state.
^The cost of office visits was applied once annually in men without prostate cancer diagnosis.
