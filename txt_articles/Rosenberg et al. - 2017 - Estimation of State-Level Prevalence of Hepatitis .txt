Background. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is the most common chronic blood-borne infection in the United States 
and a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Previous analyses of the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 
(NHANES) indicated approximately 3.6 million noninstitutionalized persons with antibody to HCV (anti-HCV). However, state-
level prevalence remains less understood and cannot be estimated reliably from NHANES alone.
Methods. We used 3 publicly available government data sources to estimate anti-HCV prevalence in each US state among 
noninstitutionalized persons aged ≥18 years. A small-area estimation model combined indirect standardization of NHANES-based 
prevalence with logistic regression modeling of mortality data, listing acute or chronic HCV infection as a cause of death, from the 
National Vital Statistics System during 1999–2012. Model results were combined with US Census population sizes to estimate total 
number and prevalence of persons with antibody to HCV in 2010.
Results. National anti-HCV prevalence was 1.67% (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.53–1.90), or 3 911 800 (95% CI, 3 589 400– 
4 447 500) adults in 2010. State-specific prevalence ranged from 0.71% (Illinois) to 3.34% (Oklahoma). The West census region had 
the highest region-specific prevalence (2.14% [95% CI, 1.96–2.48]); 10 of 13 states had rates above the national average. The South 
had the highest number of persons with anti-HCV (n = 1 561 600 [95% CI, 1 427 700–1 768 900]). The Midwest had the lowest 
region-specific prevalence (1.14% [95% CI, 1.04%–1.30%]).
Conclusions. States in the US West and South have been most impacted by hepatitis C. Estimates of HCV infection burden are 
essential to guide policy and programs to optimally prevent, detect, and cure infection.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is the most common blood-
borne infection in the United States [1]; untreated infection is a 
leading cause of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, is the 
most frequent cause of liver failure requiring transplantation, 
and causes more deaths annually than human immunodefi-
ciency virus (HIV) [2–5]. About 70% of persons with untreated 
HCV infection remain infected for life. HCV infection may be 
asymptomatic and approximately half of persons are unaware 
of their infection [6]. Within 30 years, 41% of infected persons 
progress to cirrhosis, leading to liver failure, hepatocellular car-
cinoma, and death from liver-related causes [2].
The annual number of new HCV infections in the United 
States was highest before HCV was discovered to be the cause 
of “non-A non-B hepatitis” in 1989; incidence declined after 
prevention guidelines and blood donor screening were imple-
mented in the 1990s. After years of level incidence, new HCV 
infections began to rise nationally in 2010, increasing >2-fold 
by 2014. Incidence of acute HCV infections has risen among 
males, persons aged 20–29 years, and American Indians/Alaska 
Natives [7]. The prevalence of HCV infection can be measured 
by a positive test for HCV antibody. Chronic HCV infection is 
associated with substantial morbidity and mortality, is highest 
among males and those born during 1945–1965, and has been 
associated with rising HCV-related mortality in recent years [1, 
4, 7–9].
Current US surveillance programs provide incomplete esti-
mates of HCV infection prevalence. In 2014, the Centers For 
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Notifiable 
Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS) included passively col-
lected laboratory reports from 40 states of acute HCV infec-
tion, and from 34 states reporting chronic HCV infection. US 
national and state-specific estimates of HCV infection preva-
lence cannot be ascertained from NNDSS data [7, 10].

National estimates of HCV prevalence have been produced 
using the US National Health and Nutrition Examination 
Survey (NHANES), which includes interviews and physical 
examinations of noninstitutionalized persons aged ≥6 years 
[11]. NHANES data for 2003–2010 estimated that 3.6 million 
persons had antibodies to HCV (anti-HCV), indicative of past 
or current HCV infection, corresponding to a national preva-
lence of 1.3% [8]. Subsequent systematic reviews estimate an 
additional 1 million HCV infections from populations excluded 
and underrepresented in NHANES, primarily homeless or 
incarcerated persons [12, 13].
State-level estimates of the prevalence of HCV infection are 
essential for guiding intervention programs, research, and fed-
eral assistance funding priorities among US states. In 2016, 
CDC funded 7 jurisdictions to conduct active case surveillance 
for HCV infection, and case counts of HCV diagnoses have 
been produced [7]. However, these states have been conduct-
ing active surveillance for few years, and most states lack local 
resources to provide similar information regarding the number 
of persons diagnosed with HCV; surveillance data are limited 
by variability in testing of persons at risk for infection and 
reporting to public health authorities.
Some jurisdictions have created their own estimates of 
prevalence using various methods, most commonly by apply-
ing NHANES-derived HCV infection prevalence rates to 
state populations [14]. The assumption that all states have the 
national NHANES prevalence of HCV infection might produce 
inaccurate state-specific estimates, because risk of HCV infec-
tion likely varies by state. Some researchers have attempted 
to improve upon this simple approach by standardizing the 
national NHANES estimate to local demographic profiles or 
creating models using case surveillance data (Supplementary 
Table 1). Despite these informative efforts, there is no complete 
set of state-specific estimates of HCV infection prevalence for 
all US states that is based on accurate and consistent methods.
Small-area estimation methods are statistical approaches 
that can be used for determining state-level HCV infection 
prevalence by allocating national prevalence estimates into 
state-specific components using data sources indicating state-
level markers of HCV infection prevalence [15]. State-level data 
sources include electronic medical records (EMRs), insurance 
claims, and laboratory and mortality data. Individual com-
mercially available EMR, claims, and laboratory datasets are 
inconsistent in their geographic and demographic representa-
tion [16]. Alternatively, mortality is systemically recorded for all 
decedents in the United States and is publicly available through 
the population-based National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) 
[4]. NVSS mortality data provide detailed information regard-
ing decedent age, sex, and race/ethnicity, which are covariates of 
state-specific HCV infection prevalence.
Here, we describe an application of small-area method-
ology to deconstruct national NHANES-estimated HCV 
infection prevalence into state-specific components using 
HCV-related mortality as a state-level data source. Sensitivity

analyses consider the uncertainty of the estimates associated 
with state-specific variation in diagnosing and treating HCV 
infection and in recording HCV-related mortality. We present 
state-level estimates of anti-HCV prevalence and compare these 
to previously published state estimates.
METHODS
We employed a synthetic small-area estimation approach that 
combined indirect standardization of NHANES data with 
regression-based estimates of state-level HCV-related mortal-
ity. The data sources and approach are described below and in 
Table 1 and Figure 1.
Data Sources
NHANES 1999–2012
Annually, NHANES uses a complex, multistage sampling 
design to select approximately 5 000 persons in 15 counties, rep-
resenting the noninstitutionalized population of persons aged 
≥6 years residing in the 50 states and Washington, District of 
Columbia [11].
NHANES tests blood specimens for HCV antibody (anti-
HCV), with RNA confirmatory testing [8]. Persons who were 
anti-HCV positive were considered to have past or current 
HCV infection [8].
Publicly available data from 7 NHANES release cycles were 
combined—a 14-year span (1999–2012) that included 36 726 
observations with anti-HCV test results (662 anti-HCV posi-
tive), and self-reported sex, race/ethnicity, and age. Race/eth-
nicity was categorized into Hispanic, non-Hispanic white, 
non-Hispanic black, and other (including multiracial) [8]. 
NHANES respondents were classified into birth cohorts—
before, during, and after 1945–1965 [17, 18]. Analyses were 
restricted to respondents aged ≥18 years; only 5 individuals 
aged <18 years were anti-HCV positive. The primary analysis 
did not include RNA confirmatory testing because of missing-
ness for 120 (15%) of tested persons in NHANES datasets.
NVSS Multiple Cause of Death Mortality Data (1999–2012)
Mortality Multiple Cause Microdata files (1999–2012) were 
obtained through the NVSS [19, 20]. Data were individual

District of Columbia and were aged ≥18 years at death. Records 
also contained International Classification of Diseases, Tenth 
Revision (ICD-10) codes for multiple underlying causes of death 
(N = 33 540 118). Demographic covariates included sex, race/
ethnicity, and birth cohort. In the primary analysis, any records 
including the ICD-10 code for acute viral hepatitis C (B17.1) or 
chronic viral hepatitis C (B18.2) as an underlying cause of death 
were considered to signal HCV-related mortality (n = 185 285).
US Census Intercensal Data (1999–2012) and 2010 US Census Data
Intercensal population estimates from the US Vintage 2000, 
2009, and 2014 datasets provided denominators for HCV-
related mortality rates during 1999–2012 [21]. Data were 
grouped into the same sex, race/ethnicity, and birth cohort cat-
egories as the NHANES and NVSS data. State-by-demographic 
group population totals from the 2010 US Census were used to 
calculate 2010 state HCV prevalence [21].
Analysis
The number of persons in each state with anti-HCV was com-
puted using the standardization-based estimator in Figure 1, 
equation 1. First, we calculated direct weighted estimates of 
national HCV-antibody prevalence µ

j for 24 strata (sex × 
race/ethnicity × birth cohort), using standard methodology 
(Figure 1, equation 1) [15]. We multiplied weighted estimates 
by state-by-demographic stratum 2010 population counts to 
generate crude state-level estimates. These were adjusted by 
the ratio of state-by-demographic stratum effects, based on the 
average HCV-related death rate q

ij in the 14-year period. We 
fit a high-order logistic regression model that approximated 
full stratification (several of 1224 strata had zero cells), permit-
ting detection of heterogeneity among strata (Figure 1, equa-
tion 3). We assessed collinearity and model fit by comparing 
observed state-level HCV-related mortality totals to model pre-
dictions [15, 22]. Mortality-adjusted HCV infection prevalence 
totals were summarized to yield estimated state-level totals Ti

(rounded to nearest hundred persons), with prevalence rates 
l

i (Figure 1, equations 1 and 2). Supplementary analyses esti-
mated state-level chronic HCV infection, defined as a positive 
or indeterminate anti-HCV test and a positive HCV RNA test, 
using the above approach but with a 12-stratum model (race/
ethnicity considered white non-Hispanic or not), due to more 
sparse NHANES data.
Sensitivity Analyses
To account for the joint statistical uncertainty in the stratified 
NHANES estimates and model-based HCV-related mortality 
estimates, we conducted a Monte Carlo simulation that respec-
tively sampled from logit-normal and normal distributions 
(k = 10 000 runs), using the standard errors for the original esti-
mates, to produce 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for state-level 
estimates.
There might be state-level variability in HCV diagnosis and 
treatment that produces state-level variability in HCV-related 
deaths or proper attribution (specific ICD-10 codes) of deaths 
to an HCV cause, although likely limited [5]. We repeated all 
analyses with a broader definition of HCV-related deaths that 
used a combination of the HCV-specific ICD-10 codes and 
less-specific, more sensitive, ICD-10 codes representing cirrho-
sis-related and hepatocellular carcinoma–related (HCC) causes 
of death (Table 1) [5]. To increase specificity of these additional 
codes, we applied available estimates of the population attribut-
able fraction (PAF) due to HCV infection (cirrhosis: 42%, HCC: 
48%; Figure 1, equation 4) [23]. We secondarily considered 
other PAF estimates in less representative populations [24, 25].
We descriptively compared model findings to other pub-
licly available reports of state estimates. Reports were excluded 
if HCV infection estimates solely involved applying national 
NHANES HCV infection prevalence estimates to total state 
population or if estimation was exclusively based on partial case 
surveillance data for HCV infection. Reports not describing the 
methodology used for prevalence estimation were included to 
facilitate more comparisons. Where possible, abstracted preva-
lence estimates were restricted to comparable noninstitutional-
ized populations.
RESULTS
The estimated national prevalence of anti-HCV in 2010 was 
1.67% (95% CI, 1.53%–1.90%), corresponding to 3 911 800 (95% 
CI, 3 589 400–4 447 500) US adults with past or current HCV 
infection. Demographic stratum-specific estimates ranged from 
0.26% for other race/ethnicity females born after 1965 to 8.02% 
for black males born 1945–1965 (Supplementary Table 2).
The prevalence of anti-HCV varied by state (Table 2 and 
Figure 2). State-specific prevalence rates ranged from 0.71% 
in Illinois to 3.34% in Oklahoma, with >2.5% additionally in 
District of Columbia, New Mexico, Oregon, and Tennessee. 
By census region and division, the West contained the most 
high-prevalence states: 10 of 13 states were above the national 
average, and the region-specific prevalence was 2.14%. The 
Pacific West division was most affected (2.30% prevalence; 
865 400 persons who had been infected with HCV). The South 
had the second-highest anti-HCV prevalence (1.80%) and 
the largest number of persons with anti-HCV (n = 1 561 600). 
Within the South, the West South Central had the highest prev-
alence (2.19%), while the South Atlantic division had the most 
persons with anti-HCV (n = 712 900). The Midwest (1.14%) 
and Northeast (1.43%) had relatively lower anti-HCV preva-
lence. Of the 21 states in these regions, only Rhode Island had 
prevalence above the national average (2.12%). Although hav-
ing prevalence rates lower than the national average, Michigan, 
New York, Pennsylvania, and Ohio each had >100 000 persons 
with anti-HCV.

In sensitivity analyses that considered the addition of 2 
potential indicators of HCV-related deaths, the above patterns 
were preserved, generally yielding state-level estimates closer 
to the national average (Figure 3 and Supplementary Tables 
3–4). Inclusion of cirrhosis-related mortality resulted in 39 of 
51 state estimates within the 95% CI bounds for the primary 
estimates that used only HCV-specific mortality. The median 
absolute deviation of state estimates between these 2 estimation 
approaches was 8% (interquartile range [IQR], 5%–16%, mul-
tiplicative scale). Inclusion of HCC-related mortality resulted 
in 50 of 51 state estimates that were within the 95% CI bounds 
for the primary estimates using HCV-specific mortality. The 
median absolute deviation of state estimates between these 2 
estimation approaches was 3% (IQR, 2%–6%). Results were 
similar when considering alternative, but less representative 
PAF estimates (Supplementary Tables 5–6). There was high 
agreement between the primary anti-HCV prevalence esti-
mates and 11 external estimates of state-level HCV infection 
prevalence (Supplementary Table 1). The 2 external estimates 
that utilized state-level HCV testing data (Arkansas, Oregon) 
were closest to our primary estimates (5.5% and 4.8% higher, 
respectively). To facilitate comparisons, Supplementary Tables 
7–8 display model-based chronic HCV infection and NHANES 
standardization–based anti-HCV estimates.
DISCUSSION
We used a small-area estimation approach to synthesize data 
from 3 publicly available systematic, population-based data 
systems and provide the first comprehensive state estimates of 
the prevalence of anti-HCV in the United States. The estimates 
were robust to multiple approaches based on additional mortal-
ity data, and were comparable to independent state estimates. 
The method and its results can be applied by state and local 
health officials to guide program planning, set priorities for 
resource allocation, and evaluate interventions.
These state-specific estimates bring a new level of under-
standing to our prior knowledge about the epidemiology of 
HCV infection in the United States. States with high estimated 
anti-HCV prevalence also contain highly urban populations 
(eg, Rhode Island, District of Columbia) and high proportions 
of the population who inject drugs (eg, Vermont, Tennessee, 
West Virginia) or who are Native Americans (eg, Oklahoma, 
New Mexico; the model did not explicitly include Native 
American race) [26, 27]. The current anti-HCV prevalence esti-
mates highlight states which, by their demographic structure 
alone, might be predicted to have lower prevalence. For exam-
ple, simple NHANES standardization yields 44 000 estimated 
cases in Oklahoma; incorporating additional data on HCV-
related deaths in Oklahoma suggests an estimated prevalence 
more than twice that high.
Our approach has significant methodologic strengths, as 
the data sources are population-based and representative of 
the underlying populations. However, our analysis has impor-
tant limitations. We aggregated data across multiple years of 
NHANES to achieve a sufficient sample for stable estimates. 
It is possible that there were secular trends over the NHANES 
period. The NHANES population samples noninstitutionalized 
adults and therefore excludes incarcerated persons, homeless 
persons, those in active military service, and persons on tribal 
lands. These populations are critical constituents of the US 
HCV epidemic, comprising up to a fifth of prevalent antibody- 
positive persons in the United States [12]. Thus, our estimates 
apply only to noninstitutionalized US populations. Mortality 
data used to allocate the NHANES-based anti-HCV total 
included deaths from institutionalized populations. Complete 
laboratory data in NHANES were nearly universally available 
for the anti-HCV test, but were less complete for RNA testing.

 State-Level Prevalence of HCV Infection • CID 2017:64 (1 June) • 1579
Thus, our primary estimates of persons with anti-HCV includes 
the 15%–25% of people infected by HCV who may have cleared 
their HCV infections but retained detectable antibodies [28]. 
Antibody-based prevalence of individuals previously or cur-
rently infected with HCV provides a conservative overestimate 
of persons indicated for clinical evaluation and HCV-related 
medical services [8]. The HCV RNA test more accurately indi-
cates active infection needing treatment. Importantly, the pro-
portion of anti-HCV positive persons with detectable HCV by 
polymerase chain reaction is also influenced by the number of 
persons successfully treated and cured of their HCV infection. 
Over time, this proportion should decline as more persons are 
identified, treated, and cured; however, the proportion will vary 
among populations with differential access to HCV-related care 
and treatment.
Finally, NHANES is likely less representative of populations 
of persons infected in recent years. Incidence of HCV infec-
tion has been increasing since 2010, and those infected in more 
recent epidemics are younger, more likely to live in rural areas, 
and likely to acquire HCV through needle-sharing behaviors 
associated with opioid use [29]. Nationally, the number of 
recent new infections is small relative to the prevalent popu-
lation, although some states with modest or low prevalence of 
infection have had larger increases than reflected in national

trends [7]. Methods that incorporate recent trends in incident 
HCV infection and in treatment can improve future iterations 
of this model.
There is some mismatch between the NHANES and mortal-
ity data: mortality data represent older trends in the epidemic. 
Also, HCV infection may not be consistently diagnosed or 
recorded on death certificates by state. However, this low sen-
sitivity of identified HCV infection in death records should not 
cause bias in our estimates unless the likelihood of diagnosis 
or recording on death certificates varies across states. We posit 
that deficiencies in diagnosis or recording likely occur, but are 
at a facility level and do not vary systematically by state. The 
impact of varying sensitivities of our case definition in mortal-
ity data were explored in extensive sensitivity analyses, and did 
not result in substantial changes to our estimates.
CONCLUSIONS
Although national recommendations for HCV prevention, test-
ing, and clinical management are developed by CDC and other 
authorities [30], decisions regarding the capacity to deliver 
these services are made at the state level. State-level estimates 
can inform these decisions in multiple ways. First, these data 
can prompt reconsiderations of HCV disease burden. These 
modeled prevalence estimates are based on publicly available 
data, allowing local authorities to assess biases in data sources 
used in the model (ie, mortality data) and the representative-
ness of the modeled data in comparisons with other local data 
sources (ie, HCV surveillance). Second, these results, supported 
by local public health authorities, provide new information to 
engage stakeholders, resulting in agreed-upon state/local esti-
mates of HCV infection prevalence. State-level prevalence esti-
mates allow state and local health officials to consider more 
investments in surveillance and collection of other strategic 
data for refining our estimates. These data can also be used 
to revise HCV-related prevention plans and guide prevention 
initiatives. For example, these data can help state/local health 
officials estimate the number of HCV-infected persons who 
remain undiagnosed. The results may help state Medicaid pro-
grams to budget funds for HCV testing and treatment. More 
broadly, having state-level estimates calculated consistently 
across states will allow states to assess their standing in relation 
to other states and to the nation as a whole, and to adapt their

prevention and control efforts to national or other state pro-
grams that have been shown to be effective.
The approach reported here can be routinely updated as new 
data become available. The same approach to estimation can also 
be extended to yield estimates for demographic strata, areas smaller 
than states, and excluded populations in each state. Modeling 
approaches can serve as a useful method to quantify the HCV epi-
demic in the absence of national case surveillance data. However, 
this should not minimize the imperative of continuing to enhance 
local surveillance efforts, especially in the context of curative HCV 
therapies. Surveillance data may provide more accurate and relia-
ble estimates of the burden of HCV infection and serve as the basis 
for public health programs to diagnose persons living with hepati-
tis C and link them to appropriate clinical services and treatment.
