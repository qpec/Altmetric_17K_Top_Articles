AbstrAct: Heart failure is a common, costly, and debilitating syndrome 
that is associated with a highly complex drug regimen, a large number 
of comorbidities, and a large and often disparate number of healthcare 
providers. All of these factors conspire to increase the risk of heart failure 
exacerbation by direct myocardial toxicity, drug-drug interactions, or both. 
This scientific statement is designed to serve as a comprehensive and 
accessible source of drugs that may cause or exacerbate heart failure 
to assist healthcare providers in improving the quality of care for these 
patients.

H
eart failure (HF) remains the leading discharge diagnosis among patients ≥65 
years of age. The estimated cost for treatment of HF in Medicare recipients is 
$31 billion and is expected to increase to $53 billion by 2030.1 Hospitalization 
for HF is the largest segment of those costs. It is likely that the prevention of drug-drug 
interactions and direct myocardial toxicity would reduce hospital admissions, thus both 
reducing costs and improving quality of life.
Patients with HF often have a high medication burden consisting of multiple 
medications and complex dosing regimens. On average, HF patients take 6.8 pre-
scription medications per day, resulting in 10.1 doses a day. This estimate does 
not include over-the-counter (OTC) medications or complementary and alternative 
medications (CAMs).2 More than 15 million Americans consume vitamins or CAMs, 
especially those with chronic illnesses. With many prescription medications switch-
ing to OTC status, the consumption of OTC products appears to be increasing. 
Older adults are the largest consumers of OTC medications, taking on average 4 
OTC medications per day. Unfortunately, the information on the prevalence of OTC 
and CAM use in patients with HF is limited. In a single-center study of 161 patients 
with HF, 88% reported using OTC medications, 34.8% took herbal supplements, and 
65.2% took vitamins.
By definition, polypharmacy is the long-term use of ≥5 medications.3 When 
prescription and OTC medications and CAM use are taken into account, polyphar-
macy may be universal in patients with HF. The reasons for polypharmacy among 
patients with HF can be both complex and multifactorial. Some of the reasons 
may be related to the increasing number of guideline-directed medications for HF 
and other comorbidities, as well as the increasing comorbidity burden in an ag-
ing population that may warrant an increasing number of specialist and provider 
visits.4,5
The HF syndrome is accompanied by a broad spectrum of both cardiovascu-
lar and noncardiovascular comorbidities. Five or more cardiovascular and non-
cardiovascular chronic conditions are present in 40% of Medicare patients with

HF. This estimate is much higher compared with the 
general Medicare population, in which only 7.6% have 
≥3 chronic conditions.6 Using the National Health and 
Nutrition Examination Survey, Wong et al7 found that 
the proportion of patients with ≥5 comorbidities in-
creased from 42.1% in the period of 1988 to 1994 to 
58% in the period of 2003 to 2008. From this analysis, 
osteoarthritis (62%), obesity (46.8%), chronic kidney 
disease (45.9%), and diabetes mellitus (38.3%) were 
the most common noncardiovascular comorbidities. 
In an analysis of noncardiac comorbidity in 122 
630 
Medicare beneficiaries, Braunstein et al8 found that di-
abetes mellitus (31%), chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease (26%), ocular disorders (24%), osteoarthritis 
(16%), and thyroid disorders (14%) predominated. As 
the burden of noncardiovascular comorbidities increas-
es, the number of medications, medication costs, and 
complexity also may increase.2
In the general population, patients with ≥5 chronic 
conditions have an average of 14 physician visits per 
year compared with only 1.5 for those with no chronic 
conditions.8–11 Medicare beneficiaries with HF see 15 
to 23 different providers annually in both the inpatient 
and outpatient settings, which could in turn increase 
the number of prescription medications prescribed.6 
As the number of prescription medications increases, 
so does the potential for adverse drug events and 
drug-drug interactions. Goldberg et al12 found that pa-
tients taking at least 2 prescription medications had 
a 13% risk of an adverse drug-drug interaction, which 
increased to 38% for 4 medications and 82% with ≥7 
medications.
Drugs may cause or exacerbate HF by causing direct 
myocardial toxicity; by negative inotropic, lusitropic, or 
chronotropic effects; by exacerbating hypertension; by 
delivering a high sodium load; or by drug-drug interac-
tions that limit the beneficial effects of HF medications. 
To avoid these negative effects, healthcare providers 
need a comprehensive and accessible guide of the pre-
scription medications, OTC medications, and CAMs that 
could exacerbate HF.
Using case reports, case series, package inserts, 
meta-analyses, and prospective and observational tri-
als, we provide a clinically relevant list of prescription 
medications that may cause myocardial toxicity or ex-
acerbate underlying myocardial dysfunction, leading to 
the precipitation or induction of HF (Tables 1 and 2), 
and highlight concerns with CAM and OTC medications. 
Medications were selected on the basis of use in the 
HF population and the potential to cause an adverse 
drug event as defined by death; an increase in health 
resource use; a change in New York Heart Association 
(NYHA) class, cardiac function, or cardiovascular dis-
ease; and a significant or transient change in medica-
tion regimen. Table 3 defines the criteria used to evalu-
ate the magnitude of precipitation or exacerbation of 
HF, the strength of evidence for HF precipitation or ex-
acerbation, and the onset of effect for the prescription 
medications discussed.
The American College of Cardiology/American Heart 
Association Class of Recommendation and Level of 
Evidence are derived independently of each other ac-
cording to established criteria13 (Table 4). The Class of 
Recommendation indicates the strength of recommen-
dation, encompassing the estimated magnitude and 
certainty of benefit of a clinical action in proportion to 
risk. The Level of Evidence rates the quality of scientific 
evidence supporting the intervention on the basis of the 
type, quantity, and consistency of data from clinical trials 
and other sources.

Analgesics
Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are com-
monly prescribed in the United States, accounting for 70 
million prescriptions and 30 billion OTC medications sold 
annually.14 The majority of NSAID-related side effects 
can be attributed to inhibition of prostaglandin produc-
tion through inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX) isoen-
zymes. Traditional NSAIDs (ie, indomethacin, ketorolac, 
ibuprofen, and diclofenac) act by nonselectively inhibit-
ing both the COX-1 isoenzyme (which is a constitutively 
expressed protein responsible for protective and regu-
latory functions) and COX-2 isoenzyme (which is induc-
ible and overexpressed during inflammation). The newer 
coxibs (celecoxib) selectively block just the COX-2 isoen-
zyme. Through inhibition of COX-1, traditional NSAIDs ad-
versely affect platelet aggregation, maintenance of the 
gastric mucosal barrier, and renal function. NSAIDs have 
the potential to trigger HF through sodium and water 
retention, increased systemic vascular resistance, and 
blunted response to diuretics.
Observational studies suggest an association between 
traditional NSAIDs use and HF precipitation and exacerba-
tion.15–18 In an evaluation of 7277 long-term NSAID users 
over 72 months, the Rotterdam study results found a trend 
to an increased risk for incident HF (adjusted relative risk 
[RR], 1.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.7–1.7). Patients 
with prevalent HF who filled at least 1 NSAID prescription 
since their diagnosis of HF had a 10-fold increased risk for 
recurrence (adjusted RR, 9.9; 95% CI, 1.7–57.0).15 Huerta 
et al18 also found an elevated risk of a first hospital admis-
sion for HF in current users of NSAIDs (adjusted RR, 1.3; 
95% CI, 1.1–1.6) that occurred independently of duration 
of exposure but was associated with higher-dose NSAIDs 
(RR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.06–1.94).
Debate surrounds the cardiovascular safety of COX-
2–selective inhibitors in patients with HF. In a large, ob-
servational cohort study of 107

supplementation of inhalational anesthetic reduces the 
required dose of intravenous anesthetics for minimal 
anesthetic concentration. General anesthetics in high 
doses often induce systemic hypotension attributable to 
myocardial depression, peripheral vasodilation, and at-
tenuated sympathetic nervous system activity.21 Inhaled 
anesthetic agents (eg, isoflurane, sevoflurane, and des-
flurane) are recommended for the maintenance of gen-
eral anesthesia in patients with ventricular dysfunction 
because of their hemodynamic stability and ischemic 
preconditioning properties.22–27 However, sole induction 
with inhalational anesthetics is generally not done be-
cause of hemodynamic instability, airway irritation, and 
relative slower onset compared with intravenous induc-
tion agents in patients with ventricular dysfunction.
Intravenous Anesthetics
Propofol is a short-acting hypnotic agent with potentia-
tion of gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor activity.28 It is 
the most commonly used intravenous anesthetic for 
the induction (2–2.5 mg/kg) and maintenance (6–12 
mg·kg−1·h−1) of anesthesia and for procedural sedation. 
Although propofol has both negative inotropic effects and 
vasodilatory properties proportional to dose, the effects 
on myocardial contractility at clinical concentrations 
are minimal. Propofol protects the myocardium against 
ischemia/reperfusion injury because of its antioxidant 
and free-radical–scavenging properties, as well as the 
related inhibition of the mitochondrial permeability tran-
sition pore. The major hemodynamic consequences of 
propofol anesthesia in the setting of left ventricular (LV) 
dysfunction are veno-dilatation causing LV preload reduc-
tion that results in a decrease in LV diastolic pressure 
and a reduction in chamber dimensions.29 Such changes 
may be beneficial, especially in the setting of elevated 
LV preload. Propofol may be cardioprotective and antiar-
discharge diagnosis of HF, Gislason et al19 found a sig-
nificant dose-related increased risk of hospitalization for 
HF, myocardial infarction (MI), and all-cause mortality for 
those taking a coxib (rofecoxib, celecoxib) or traditional 
NSAID (ie, ibuprofen, diclofenac, naproxen). The Ameri-
can College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart 
Association HF guidelines recommend that this class of 
drugs should be avoided or withdrawn whenever pos-
sible.13
Anesthesia Medications
With an aging population and increasing prevalence of 
patients with HF, a growing number of high-risk patients 
are undergoing surgical procedures with an increased 
risk of perioperative cardiac morbidity, mortality, and re-
source use. Hammill et al20 observed a 63% increased 
risk of operative mortality and a 51% greater risk of 
30-day all-cause readmission among patients with HF 
compared with patients without HF or coronary artery 
disease. Most anesthetics interfere with cardiovascular 
performance, by either direct myocardial depression 
(negative inotropy) or modification of cardiovascular con-
trol mechanisms (ie, heart rate, contractility, preload, af-
terload, and vascular resistance).
Inhalational or Volatile Anesthetics
The halogenated anesthetics include halothane, enflu-
rane, isoflurane, desflurane, and sevoflurane. These 
inhalational or volatile anesthetics (except halothane 
and enflurane) are commonly used for balanced general 
anesthesia in all patients, including patients with car-
diovascular disease and compromised ventricular func-
tion. Compared with total intravenous anesthesia with a 
single agent (eg, narcotic, propofol, or benzodiazepine),

rhythmogenic by inducing pharmacological precondition-
ing of the myocardium through a mechanism similar to 
the inhalational anesthetics.29 For total intravenous anes-
thesia, propofol is always combined with an opioid and a 
benzodiazepine, with or without a neuromuscular block-
ade agent.
Etomidate is a short-acting hypnotic with gamma-
aminobutyric acid–like effects. It results in the least 
cardiovascular depression of all anesthetics, and it 
does not appear to elevate plasma histamine or cause 
histamine release when administered in recommended 
doses. It is commonly used to induce anesthesia (0.2–
0.6 mg/kg over 30–60 seconds) in patients with car-
diovascular disease; however, it is not generally used 
to maintain anesthesia because it suppresses adreno-
cortical function.29
Ketamine, a dissociative anesthetic, is a noncom-
petitive N-methyl-d-aspartate glutamate receptor an-
tagonist with both direct negative inotropic effects 
and central sympathetic stimulation and inhibition of 
neuronal catecholamine uptake. These latter effects 
counteract the direct negative inotropic effects, re-
sulting in stable hemodynamics during the induction 
of anesthesia. However, in patients with significant LV 
dysfunction, the sympathetic stimulation may not be 
adequate to overcome the negative inotropic effects, 
resulting in deterioration in cardiac performance and 
cardiovascular instability.29

Dexmedetomidine is an α2-adrenergic agonist that 
has been used intraoperatively as part of balanced an-
esthesia and postoperatively for sedation and analgesia 
after surgery or during mechanical ventilation. In a small, 
retrospective, observation study of children with HF, dex-
medetomidine did not affect heart rate, mean arterial 
pressure, or inotrope score at the termination of infu-
sion; however, 2 patients had a 50% decrease in mean 
arterial pressure and 1 patient had a 50% decrease in 
heart rate compared with baseline in the first 3 hours of 
infusion.30 In neurocritical care patients, dexmedetomi-
dine exhibited similar incidences of severe hypotension 
(mean arterial pressure <60 mm 
Hg) and bradycardia 
(heart rate <50 bpm) compared with propofol.31
Antidiabetic Medications
Biguanides
Metformin is a biguanide insulin sensitizer that reduces 
hepatic gluconeogenesis. Ninety percent of the drug is 
eliminated by renal excretion. Although considered a 
first-line agent in the management of type 2 diabetes 
Table 4. Applying Classification of recommendations and Level of Evidence
A recommendation with Level of Evidence B or C does not imply that the recommendation is weak. Many important clinical questions addressed in 
the guidelines do not lend themselves to clinical trials. Although randomized trials are unavailable, there may be a very clear clinical consensus that a 
particular test or therapy is useful or effective.
*Data available from clinical trials or registries about the usefulness/efficacy in different subpopulations, such as sex, age, history of diabetes, history 
of prior myocardial infarction, history of heart failure, and prior aspirin use.
†For comparative effectiveness recommendations (Class I and IIa; Level of Evidence A and B only), studies that support the use of comparator verbs 
should involve direct comparisons of the treatments or strategies being evaluated.

mellitus, metformin has a legacy of concern because 
of its biguanide predecessor phenformin, which demon-
strated a strong causal association with lactic acidosis 
and was removed from clinical use in 1978. Tradition-
ally, metformin was contraindicated primarily in condi-
tions predisposing to lactic acidosis such as renal fail-
ure, liver disease, severe pulmonary disease, and HF. In 
an evaluation of 47 patients with metformin-related lactic 
acidosis occurring between 1995 and 1996, 43% had 
a fatal outcome and 91% had ≥1 risk factors for lactic 
acidosis, including 38% with HF.32 However, in 2006, the 
US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) removed HF as 
an absolute contraindication on the basis of the findings 
of 2 large observational studies and clinical experience 
that suggested that the risk of metformin-associated lac-
tic acidosis was minimal and similar to that of other dia-
betes mellitus medications in patients with HF and that 
metformin was associated with an overall reduction in 
mortality.33–35 In a retrospective cohort study of 16 
417 
Medicare beneficiaries with diabetes mellitus discharged 
after a HF hospitalization, Masoudi et al34 demonstrated 
that metformin administration was linked with a reduced 
risk of mortality (odds ratio [OR], 0.86; 95% CI, 0.78–
0.97). In a recent systematic review of trial and nontrial 
evidence, Eurich et al36 also found metformin to be as-
sociated with a reduction in mortality (pooled adjusted 
risk estimate, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.74–0.87; P<0.001) com-
pared with controls (mostly sulfonylurea therapy). Similar 
findings were reported in patients with HF and chronic 
kidney disease (pooled adjusted risk estimate, 0.81; 
95% CI, 0.64–1.02; P=0.08). Of note, metformin was 
not associated with an increased risk for lactic acidosis 
in either analysis.
The 2016 American Diabetes Association standards 
of medical care currently recommend that metformin 
can be used in patients with stable HF if their renal func-
tion is normal (eg, >60 mL·min−1·1.73 m−2) but should 
be avoided in unstable or hospitalized patients with HF.37 
However, in 2016, the FDA published a safety announce-
ment recommending that metformin be contraindicated 
in patients with renal function below 30 mL/min/1.73 
m2.38 Unfortunately, prospective data evaluating the 
safety of metformin in patients with advanced HF (stage 
D), in whom hepatic and renal dysfunction is often en-
countered, are lacking.
Thiazolidinediones
Thiazolidinediones, rosiglitazone and pioglitazone, are 
proliferator-activator receptor gamma agonists that 
modulate the transcription of the insulin-sensitive genes 
involved in the control of glucose and lipid metabolism 
in adipose tissue, muscle, and liver. Early postmarket-
ing data and data from randomized, controlled trials 
reported increased edema and weight gain in patients 
receiving thiazolidinediones with preexisting cardiac dis-
ease and in those with no history of HF.39–42 In the DREAM 
trial (Diabetes Reduction Assessment With Ramipril and 
Rosiglitazone Medication), which evaluated rosiglitazone 
versus placebo in patients at risk for type 2 diabetes 
mellitus, more confirmed cases of HF were found in 
those patients treated with rosiglitazone (n=2635) com-
pared with placebo (n=2634; hazard ratio [HR], 7.03; 
95% CI, 1.60–30.9; P=0.01).43 Recent meta-analyses, 
which included pivotal randomized, controlled trials, and 
observational studies strongly suggested that thiazoli-
dinediones exacerbate existing HF and increase the risk 
for new-onset HF.42,44–48 In a retrospective analysis of 
227 
571 Medicare beneficiaries treated with a thiazoli-
dinedione, Graham et al49 found that the risk of HF was 
greater with rosiglitazone compared with pioglitazone 
(HR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.16–1.34).
Limited prospective data exist evaluating thiazolidin-
ediones in patients with HF. Dargie et al50 reported that 
after 52 weeks of treatment with rosiglitazone or place-
bo in 224 patients with diabetes mellitus and NYHA class 
I to II HF (LV ejection fraction [LVEF] ≤45%), there was 
a trend for an increase in all-cause mortality (HR, 1.5; 
95% CI, 0.49–4.59) and HF hospitalizations (RR, 1.30; 
95% CI, 0.35–4.82) for patients receiving rosiglitazone. 
In a 6-month randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial 
of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and NYHA class 
II to III HF (LVEF ≤40%), Giles et al51 found that patients 
receiving pioglitazone (n=262) had an earlier time to the 
onset of HF and a higher incidence of the composite 
of cardiovascular mortality and hospitalization or emer-
gency room visits for HF compared with those receiv-
ing glyburide (13% versus 8%, respectively; P=0.024). 
The 2016 American Diabetes Association standards of 
medical care recommend avoiding thiazolidinediones in 
patients with symptomatic HF.37
Dipeptidyl Peptidase-4 Inhibitors
Sitagliptin, saxagliptin, alogliptin, and linagliptin repre-
sent a newer class of antidiabetic agents that bind re-
versibly to the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 enzyme, thereby 
preventing the degradation of endogenously released in-
cretin hormones, glucose-dependent insulinotropic poly-
peptide, and glucagon-like peptide-1, which increases 
insulin release and decreases glucagon levels.52 In the 
SAVOR-TIMI 53 study (Saxagliptin Assessment of Vascu-
lar Outcomes Recorded in Patients With Diabetes Melli-
tus–Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction), 16 
492 pa-
tients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who were high risk for 
cardiovascular events, of whom 12.8% had HF, were ran-
domized to usual diabetes mellitus care with saxagliptin 
or usual diabetes mellitus care plus placebo. Although no 
difference was found in the risk of cardiovascular death, 
MI, or stroke after a median of 2.1 years, the investi-
gators demonstrated an excess of HF hospitalization in 
patients receiving saxagliptin (HR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.07–
1.51).53 In an observational US claims database analysis 
evaluating 7620 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus

and incident HF treated with metformin or sulfonylurea, 
sitagliptin use was also associated with an increased 
risk of HF hospitalizations (adjusted OR, 1.84; 95% CI, 
1.16–2.92).54 A meta-analysis of all randomized trials of 
vildagliptin, sitagliptin, saxagliptin, alogliptin, linagliptin, 
and dutogliptin found an elevated overall risk of acute 
HF in those patients taking any dipeptidyl peptidase-4 
inhibitor (OR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.03–1.37), suggesting a 
possible class effect.55 However, in the EXAMINE trial 
(Examination of Cardiovascular Outcomes with Alogliptin 
versus Standard of Care in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes 
Mellitus and Acute Coronary Syndrome), which enrolled 
5380 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and a re-
cent acute coronary syndrome event, the investigators 
found a nonsignificant trend in hospital admission rate 
for HF for those receiving alogliptin (3.1%) compared 
with placebo (2.9%) (HR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.79–1.46).38 
Additionally, in the post hoc analysis, alogliptin had no ef-
fect on the composite end point of cardiovascular death 
and hospital admission for HF (HR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.82–
1.21).38 The true mechanism of this potential increase in 
HF hospitalization remains unknown.
Antiarrhythmic Medications
Class I Antiarrhythmics
Several of the class I antiarrhythmics, which are sodium 
channel blockers, are known to be potentially harmful 
in patients with HF. Disopyramide is a negative inotrope 
with marked myocardial depressant effects in patients 
with HF.56,57 Furthermore, in 100 patients treated with 
oral disopyramide for ventricular arrhythmias, 16 (12 
with a previous history of HF) developed HF within the 
first 48 hours of therapy. Thus, disopyramide can both 
precipitate and exacerbate HF.58 Flecainide may also de-
press LV function significantly in patients with preexisting 
LV dysfunction; this finding and the increased mortality 
associated with flecainide in CAST (Cardiac Arrhythmia 
Suppression Trial) suggest that it be avoided in patients 
with HF or structural heart disease.59–62
Class III Antiarrhythmics
Intravenous ibutilide did not have clinically significant he-
modynamic effects in patients with reduced LV function 
(LVEF ≤35%), but HF was an independent risk factor for 
ibutilide-induced torsades de pointes (TdP), presumably 
because of the preexisting prolongation of the QT inter-
val in these patients.63 Sotalol is a racemic mixture of d- 
and l-sotalol and has both Class II β-adrenergic blocking 
(mediated largely by the l-isomer) and Class III (mediated 
by both d- and l-isomers) antiarrhythmic properties. A 
study examining whether d-sotalol decreased mortality 
in patients surviving an MI who had reduced LV func-
tion was terminated prematurely because of increased 
mortality.64 In contrast, racemic sotalol did not increase 
mortality after MI.65 Sotalol can depress myocardial 
contractility and exacerbate HF in some patients and 
should be used cautiously in patients with LV dysfunc-
tion. In premarketing studies, the incidence of new or 
worsened HF over 1 year was 3% in patients without 
previous HF and 10% in those with a history of HF.66 
The risk of worsening of HF increased as the severity of 
baseline HF increased.
Dronedarone
Like amiodarone, dronedarone inhibits the calcium, so-
dium, and potassium channels and is both an α-and a 
β-adrenergic receptor antagonist. Dronedarone therapy 
reduced death and cardiovascular hospitalizations sig-
nificantly in ATHENA (A Placebo-Controlled, Double-Blind, 
Parallel Arm Trial to Assess the Efficacy of Dronedarone 
400 mg bid for the Prevention of Cardiovascular Hos-
pitalization or Death From Any Cause in Patients With 
Atrial Fibrillation/Atrial Flutter).67 A post hoc analysis of 
a subset of 209 patients (of a total of 4628) with stable 
HF in that study found no increase in mortality and a 
trend to decreased cardiovascular hospitalization with 
dronedarone.68 However, ANDROMEDA (Antiarrhythmic 
Trial With Dronedarone in Moderate to Severe CHF Eval-
uating Morbidity Decrease), a study that examined the 
effect of dronedarone on death and hospitalization for 
HF, was terminated prematurely for increased mortality 
(8.1%) in the dronedarone arm compared with placebo 
(3.8%). The excess mortality was caused mostly by 
HF.69 Another study, PALLAS (Permanent Atrial Fibrilla-
tion Outcome Study), tested whether dronedarone re-
duced cardiovascular events in patients with permanent 
atrial fibrillation. PALLAS was terminated prematurely 
after enrolling 3236 patients because dronedarone was 
associated with an increase in cardiovascular death, 
stroke, and hospitalization for HF (HR, 1.81; 95% CI, 
1.10–2.99; P=0.02).70 Thus, the prescribing informa-
tion for dronedarone carries a black box warning that 
the drug is contraindicated in patients with symptomatic 
HF with recent decompensation requiring hospitaliza-
tion, or NYHA class IV HF, with a doubling of the mortal-
ity in these patients.
Antihypertensive Medications
α1-Blockers
The α-blockers such as prazosin and doxazosin inhibit 
postsynaptic α1-adrenergic receptors and relax vascular 
smooth muscle resulting in vasodilation. Initially used for 
the management of hypertension, these agents are now 
used primarily for benign prostatic hypertrophy on the 
basis of the negative findings from ALLHAT (Antihyper-
tensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart 
Attack Trial).71 In ALLHAT, the risk of HF was doubled (RR, 
2.04; 95% CI, 1.79–2.32; P<0.001) in patients receiv-
ing doxazosin compared with chlorthalidone. The doxa-
zosin arm of the trial was stopped prematurely. Several

e44
reasons for the increased risk of HF in the doxazosin 
arm have been suggested, including misdiagnosis of 
vasodilator-induced edema, a smaller blood pressure 
reduction with doxazosin, and the unmasking of HF by 
the discontinuation of other antihypertensive drugs that 
were protective against HF.72 Additionally, in VeHFT (Vet-
erans Heart Failure Trial-1), hydralazine combined with 
isosorbide dinitrate decreased mortality and improved 
LVEF compared with placebo, whereas prazosin did 
not.73
Calcium Channel Blockers
Dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists such as 
nifedipine have both negative inotropic and vasodilat-
ing effects by blocking the transmembrane influx of 
calcium ions into cardiac and vascular smooth mus-
cles.74 In small trials assessing the potential therapeu-
tic benefits of nifedipine in patients with HF, there was a 
marked worsening of HF; 5 of 21 patients treated with 
nifedipine required hospitalization compared with 0 of 
20 who received isosorbide dinitrate.75 A possible ben-
efit of amlodipine in a subgroup of patients with non-
ischemic cardiomyopathy and HF was not reproduced 
in a second study in which there was no evidence of 
a favorable or unfavorable effect of amlodipine on 
mortality (HR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.83–1.13; P=0.66).76,77 
Both trials, however, observed higher frequencies of 
peripheral edema and pulmonary edema and lower fre-
quencies of uncontrolled hypertension and chest pain 
in patients treated with amlodipine. Thus, amlodipine 
does not improve mortality but may exacerbate HF. 
Diltiazem and verapamil also have negative inotropic 
effects and can worsen HF more than the dihydropyri-
dine calcium channel blockers because the negative 
inotropic effects are not offset by vasodilation. In a 
study of 2466 patients with recent MI randomized to 
diltiazem or placebo, diltiazem increased the risk of 
adverse cardiac events (HR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.01–1.96) 
in the subgroup of 490 patients with baseline pulmo-
nary congestion.78 The risk of adverse cardiac events 
in patients receiving diltiazem was directly related to 
the severity of baseline HF.78
Centrally Acting α-Adrenergic Agonists
Sympathetic adrenergic activity is increased in HF, 
and the increase in activity is directly associated with 
higher mortality. The consistent effectiveness of β-
adrenergic receptor antagonists in reversing myocar-
dial remodeling and in improving mortality in patients 
with HF and reduced LVEF stimulated an interest in 
other mechanisms of decreasing sympathetic activity 
as a treatment for HF. Centrally acting α2-adrenergic 
agonists such as clonidine and moxonidine decrease 
sympathetic outflow and thus decrease plasma nor-
epinephrine concentrations and blood pressure. In 
an animal model of HF, clonidine improved survival.79 
Furthermore, in small studies of patients with HF, cloni-
dine had beneficial hemodynamic effects; for example, 
clonidine 0.15 mg twice daily decreased plasma nor-
epinephrine concentrations by >50% and decreased 
preload and increased stroke volume significantly.79 
However, both bradycardia and atrioventricular dis-
sociation have been reported with clonidine.80,81 A 
placebo-controlled trial of sustained-release moxoni-
dine, an imidazoline receptor agonist, in patients with 
NYHA class II to IV HF was terminated prematurely 
after 1934 patients were enrolled. Although moxoni-
dine significantly decreased plasma norepinephrine, 
there existed an increased mortality in those receiv-
ing moxonidine (54 deaths [5.5%]) compared with pla-
cebo (32 deaths [3.4%]).82,83 LV reverse remodeling 
occurred with monoxidine. This increase in mortality 
could be caused by the large and rapid decrease in sym-
pathetic outflow, leading to myocardial depression and 
an inability to access myocardial β-adrenergic support 
 
mechanisms acutely.83
Minoxidil
Minoxidil, a vasodilator, improves hemodynamics but 
worsens clinical outcomes in patients with HF. In a dou-
ble-blind study of minoxidil 20 mg twice daily (n=9) ver-
sus placebo (n=8), LVEF increased from 29.6±17.7% to 
42.7±22.3% (P<0.05) after 3 months of minoxidil and 
remained unchanged in the placebo group. However, 
there were more clinical events (eg, worsening HF, an 
increased need for diuretics, and death) in the minoxi-
dil group (21 events) than the placebo group (7 events; 
P<0.01).84
Anti-infective Medications
Azole Antifungal Medication
Itraconazole has been associated with occasional re-
ports of cardiotoxicity, including hypertension, prema-
ture ventricular contractions, ventricular fibrillation, 
and new-onset and worsening HF.85–90 Using the FDA 
Adverse Event Reporting System from 1992 to 2001, 
Ahmad et al89 found 58 cases of HF in patients admin-
istered itraconazole. Because of potential confound-
ers such as hypertension, valvular heart disease, and 
history of HF, causality was not determined; however, 
of the 58 patients, there were 28 admissions to the 
hospital and 13 deaths. On the basis of animal and 
clinical pharmacology studies, itraconazole may exert 
negative inotropic effects; however, the mechanism is 
not known.89 On the basis of these data, the FDA recom-
mends avoiding itraconazole in patients with ventricular 
dysfunction or a history of HF for onychomycosis and 
only to consider itraconazole in case of life-threatening 
fungal infections.85-90

formulation have been reported.91–93 In each case, HF 
symptoms and echocardiographic findings normalized 
on discontinuation of therapy, which occurred within 10 
days to 6 months of drug discontinuation.
Anticancer Medications
Anthracyclines
The anthracyclines are a highly used class of cytotoxic 
agents that target proliferating cells via a diverse mecha-
nism that includes DNA intercalation, production of damag-
ing reactive oxygen species, and inhibition of the activity 
of topoisomerase II. Myocytes are particularly susceptible 
to anthracycline-induced cellular damage because of their 
relative lack of reactive oxygen species–detoxifying en-
zymes such as catalase, resulting in cardiotoxicity. Use of 
these agents is often associated with a delayed cardiotox-
ic presentation as a result of a biochemical transformation 
of the parent drug into a secondary alcohol metabolite in 
the myocyte, which is cleared much less quickly from the 
cell. This produces a prolonged cellular concentration and 
continued damage that results in decreased contractility 
and subsequent cell death.94 The anthracycline class of 
drugs includes older agents, doxorubicin and daunorubi-
cin, and newer agents, epirubicin, idarubicin, and mito-
xantrone.95
Administration of anthracyclines leads to acute, early-
onset, and delayed-onset cardiotoxicity. Acute cardiotox-
icity manifests within days of administration and most 
commonly includes rhythm abnormalities (arrhythmias) 
but also electrocardiographic changes, tachycardia, 
and pericarditis/myocarditis. Early-onset (within the first 
year) and delayed-onset (after the first year) cardiotoxic-
ity from anthracyclines present as progressive and often 
irreversible HF. The risk of developing anthracycline-
induced HF (A-HF) increases with increased cumulative 
dose and can occur >20 years after the completion of 
therapy.96
A-HF was reported beginning in the late 1960s. In re-
sponse to growing case reports, a retrospective chart 
review of 3491 patients identified a clear cumulative in-
crease in the risk of developing HF with increasing doses 
of doxorubicin, expressly at total doses >550 mg/m2, 
thereby suggesting the theoretical cumulative dose limit 
that is often used clinically today to minimize the risk 
of A-HF. This study showed an overall incidence of clini-
cally recognized HF in 2.2% of all evaluated patients.97 A 
more contemporary retrospective analysis of 630 adult 
patients from 3 separate clinical studies suggests an 
overall incidence of A-HF of 5.1% (32 of 630). This study 
confirmed a dose-dependent increase in the risk of HF, 
with an estimated cumulative percentage of patients with 
A-HF of 5% at 400 mg/m2, 16% at 500 mg/m2, and 26% 
at 550 mg/m2.98
The incidence of A-HF in pediatric populations has 
been reported to be 0% to 16% in available studies in 
the literature.99 One study evaluated a cohort of 830 pe-
diatric cancer survivors with a mean follow-up time of 
8.5 years and found a cumulative incidence of A-HF of 
2.5%. On the basis of the follow-up, the authors found an 
estimated risk of developing A-HF after the first dose to 
be 2% (95% CI, 1–3) at 2 years, 2.4% (95% CI, 1.3–3.5) 
after 5 years, 2.6% (95% CI, 1.4–3.9) after 10 years, 
3.7% (95% CI, 1.8–5.5) after 15 years, and 5.5% (95% 
CI, 1.5–9.5) after 20 years. Besides an increased risk 
with increasing time since the first dose, cumulative 
doses >300 mg/m2 were identified as an independent 
risk factor for developing HF (RR=8), increasing the es-
timated risk of HF at 20 years after the first dose to 
9.8% (95% CI, 2.2–17.4) and suggesting that pediatric 
populations are susceptible to cardiomyopathy at much 
lower cumulative doses than those first identified in adult 
populations.100 Furthermore, a meta-analysis of 30 stud-
ies including 12 
507 pediatric patients identified doses 
of >45 mg/m2 given within 1 week as an independent 
predictor of developing A-HF through multivariate regres-
sion analysis. The frequency of observed A-HF in patients 
receiving >45 mg/m2 during a 1-week period was pre-
dicted to be 5.8% higher than that for patients receiving 
lower weekly doses.99 Despite these data, dose limits 
have not been lowered for pediatric patients in light of 
the high cure rates seen in this population. As a result, 
pediatric cancer survivors require lifelong cardiac moni-
toring because anthracycline toxicity can manifest ≥20 
years after therapy.
Although many of the available studies address the in-
cidence of clinically relevant (symptomatic) A-HF, emerg-
ing data support the presence of subclinical (lacking 
overt clinical symptoms but with underlying measurable 
cardiac dysfunction) diastolic and systolic myocardial ab-
normalities in a majority (up to 60%) of patients, even at 
low cumulative doses (100 mg/m2).94,101
The current standard for cardiac monitoring in patients 
receiving an anthracycline is LVEF assessment. Although 
useful in identifying myocardial damage, it does so only af-
ter cardiac injury has occurred. Novel approaches to iden-
tify patients with anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity earlier 
in their treatment paradigm include the use of biomarkers. 
Elevations in cardiac troponin, a biomarker of ischemic 
heart disease, have been associated with the development 
of LV dysfunction and subclinical myocardial damage and 
with late cardiac abnormalities in both the adult and pedi-
atric cancer populations.102 The role of natriuretic peptides 
(NP) such as atrial NP, amino-terminal fragments, brain NP, 
and its N-terminal fragments, released from cardiomyo-
cytes in response to increased wall stress, has also been 
explored. Despite data that demonstrate a correlation be-
tween increased NP and the development of subclinical car-
diac injury, conflicting data that contradict this finding ex-
ist.102 More recently, myeloperoxidase has been identified 
as another potential biomarker of chemotherapy-induced 
cardiac dysfunction.103 Although the use of biomarkers in

this setting has exhibited potential to predict early cardiac 
dysfunction, standardization of routine use of these mea-
surements in clinical practice has yet to be determined.
As stated, the major risk factor for developing A-HF 
is increasing cumulative dose. Other identified risk fac-
tors include female sex, black race, mediastinal radia-
tion, young age (<4 years), old age (>66 years), pre-
existing cardiovascular disorders, and shorter length 
of infusion.97,99,104–107 Pharmacogenetic studies have 
demonstrated an increased risk of A-HF in patients with 
polymorphisms in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide 
phosphate-oxidase (involved in free radical metabolism), 
efflux proteins, and myocardial cytosolic carbonyl re-
ductases that are responsible for the formation of the 
cardiotoxic alcohol metabolites.108,109 Enhanced cardio-
toxicity may occur when anthracyclines are administered 
with taxanes, trastuzumab, cyclophosphamide, or other 
agents that cause further cardiac injury.95
Numerous strategies have been examined in an at-
tempt to decrease the risk of cardiotoxicity from an-
thracyclines. Early studies with the chemically modified 
anthracyclines such as epirubicin, idrarubicin, and mito-
xantrone suggested a lower incidence of HF.95 However, 
data from subsequent studies in larger populations and 
with increasing doses still suggest a risk at higher cu-
mulative doses. An analysis of 469 patients treated with 
epirubicin for metastatic breast cancer demonstrated a 
cumulative risk of A-HF of 7.2%, with an estimated risk 
of HF of 1.9% at a cumulative dose of 800 mg/m2 to 
15% at 1000 mg/m2.110 Dose-dependent cardiotoxicity 
was observed with the other anthracyclines, especially 
at high doses, undermining their ability to decrease cu-
mulative HF compared with doxorubicin.111
Dexrazoxane is metabolized to an ethylenediami-
netetraacetic acid–like compound in cardiomyocytes 
that binds iron, minimizes oxidative stress induced by 
anthracyclines, and has antitumor effects via inhibition 
of topoisomerase II. A meta-analysis of 8 studies sug-
gested a decrease in the development of HF with the use 
of dexrazoxane but also showed a nonsignificant trend 
to a decreased response rate.112 As a result of concerns 
for efficacy, current American Society of Clinical Oncol-
ogy guidelines discourage the routine use of dexrazox-
ane, recommending consideration for its use primarily in 
adults with metastatic breast cancer once the cumula-
tive dose of anthracyclines exceeds 300 mg/m2.113
Another approach to prevent A-HF involves modify-
ing the pharmacokinetics of the anthracycline through 
the use of liposomal formulations that attain a high 
peak concentration and longer circulating time while 
minimizing free anthracycline released into the blood. 
The large size of the formulation minimizes its ability 
to penetrate the normal vasculature of the heart but 
allows penetration into the more porous tumor endothe-
lium.94 Although a meta-analysis using 2 randomized, 
controlled trials (n=520) confirmed a decrease in clini-
cal HF with the use of liposomal doxorubicin (RR, 0.20; 
95% CI, 0.05–0.75), its use clinically is often deemed 
cost-prohibitive and has been hindered by supply is-
sues.114
There are currently limited data to determine the best 
course of treatment for A-HF. Standard medical therapy 
with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (enalapril) 
and β-blockers (metoprolol, carvedilol) has been report-
ed to result in improved symptoms and LVEF. However, 
long-term, prospective follow-up data are lacking.96,115 
Preliminary studies suggest that cardiotoxicity may be 
ameliorated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibi-
tors or β-blockers. A position statement from the Eu-
ropean Society of Cardiology recommends the use of 
standard, guideline-based treatment for the patient who 
develops chemotherapy-induced HF.116,117
Alkylating Agents
Cyclophosphamide, a nonspecific alkylating agent that is 
the backbone of many “induction” bone marrow trans-
plantation regimens, is used to treat a variety of solid 
and hematologic malignancies. Cyclophosphamide ex-
erts antitumor effects by DNA cross-linking and inhibition 
of DNA synthesis.118 Cyclophosphamide is a prodrug that 
requires hepatic conversion to its active phosphoramide 
mustard via cytochrome P450 enzymes. In a pharmaco-
kinetic study of 19 women with metastatic breast cancer 
receiving cyclophosphamide for the induction of autolo-
gous bone marrow transplantation, lower areas under 
the curve were observed in patients who developed HF. 
The authors suggest that increased metabolism of the 
prodrug to its active metabolite increases organ toxicity 
seen with the agent.119 Although a precise mechanism 
of cardiac injury has not been elucidated, preclinical 
studies suggest that the active phosphoramide mustard 
causes increased free radical formation in cardiac tissue, 
leading to cell damage.120 Autopsies of patients who suf-
fered fatal cyclophosphamide-induced HF indicate the 
presence of hemorrhagic myocarditis. The presence of 
microthrombi and proteinaceous exudates suggests sig-
nificant endothelial damage with cyclophosphamide.121 
Acute HF has been reported in 17% to 28% of patients 
receiving cyclophosphamide for induction therapy (ie, at 
high doses used in transplantation regimens), with further 
evidence of subclinical decreases in LVEF in up to 50% 
of cases.122 The onset of HF is acute, occurring within 
1 to 10 days of treatment, and usually resolves over 3 
to 4 weeks; however, fatalities caused by HF have been 
reported.123 Large individual doses (>120–170 mg/kg or 
1.55 mg/m2 per day), old age, mediastinal radiation, and 
anthracycline use have been identified as risk factors for 
the development of HF with cyclophosphamide.118,123,124
Ifosfamide is an alkylating agent with a mechanism of 
action similar to that of cyclophosphamide that also re-
quires hepatic activation to its phosphoramide mustard. 
HF caused by ifosfamide occurs analogously to that seen

with cyclophosphamide as an acute (within 1–10 days) 
and often reversible phenomena.118 In a small study of 
patients given ifosfamide for induction therapy, 17% (9 
of 52) developed HF at doses >12.5 mg/m2.125
Mitomycin C, an antibiotic isolated from Streptomy-
ces caespitosus, exerts antitumor effects through al-
kylation and DNA cross-linking.126 Mitomycin is reduced 
intracellularly to a semiquinone radical that, in the an-
aerobic environment of many tumors, is further reduced 
to hydroquinone, which binds DNA. However, in aerobic 
environments such as that seen in cardiomyocytes, 
the semiquinone radical is oxidized to the parent com-
pound accompanied by free radical formation.118 This in-
creased oxidative stress is thought to be the mechanism 
of cardiac damage seen with mitomycin alone and may 
explain an increased prevalence of HF observed when 
mitomycin is used in combination with anthracyclines.127 
HF is generally observed after the administration of a 
median of 3 cycles and at doses >30 mg/m2 of mito-
mycin. A higher incidence of HF (15.3%) was observed 
when mitomycin was given after anthracycline treatment 
than would be expected with either agent alone.118
Antimetabolites
Fluorouracil (5-FU) is an antimetabolite that inhibits thy-
midylate synthase, causing cell death. Capecitabine 
is an oral fluoropyrimidine that undergoes hydrolysis 
in the liver to form the active 5-FU metabolite.126 5-FU 
is well known for its cardiotoxic effects, occurring in 
7.6% of patients undergoing high-dose infusions.128 
The most common cardiotoxicity associated with 5-FU 
is ischemic in nature and thought to be a result of the 
induction of coronary vasospasm. Overall, cardiotoxic-
ity is more common (up to 18%) with intravenous 5-FU 
compared with oral capecitabine (1.9%–3.7%).129,130 
Although the exact incidence is unknown, a growing 
number of case reports recognize cardiomyopathy and 
acute decreases in LVEF with 5-FU treatment.131–133 Api-
cal ballooning, commonly seen in Takotsubo cardiomy-
opathy, has been reported on numerous occasions. Pa-
tients appear to recover normal cardiac function within 
weeks after discontinuing the drug.134,135
Targeted Therapies
Trastuzumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody tar-
geted against the extracellular domain of the human 
epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (ErbB2 receptor), 
is used widely in the treatment of ErbB2 receptor–posi-
tive breast carcinoma.136 In some patients, this agent 
induces significant cardiac dysfunction, presumably be-
cause of the inhibition of the ErbB2 signaling pathway 
within cardiomyocytes.116,137 Trastuzumab cardiotoxicity 
is also believed to be related to antibody-dependent and 
complement-dependent cytotoxicity.138
An independent review of 7 phase II and III clinical tri-
als first established an increased rate of cardiac dysfunc-
tion.139 Patients who received trastuzumab in addition to 
anthracyclines and cyclophosphamide had a 27% inci-
dence of cardiotoxicity compared with 8% in those who 
received anthracyclines and cyclophosphamide alone. 
The rate of NYHA class III or IV HF was 16% compared 
with 4%. In patients who received trastuzumab in con-
junction with paclitaxel, the incidence of cardiac dysfunc-
tion was similarly increased (13% versus 1%), although 
patients experienced a lesser degree of functional im-
pairment.140,141 Subsequent large-scale, randomized, 
adjuvant clinical trials have demonstrated a significant, 
but predominantly reversible, cardiotoxic effect that 
manifests itself as an asymptomatic decline in LVEF.136 
In these studies, the reported incidence of severe HF 
and death was 3% to 4%; symptomatic HF, 2% to 5%; 
and asymptomatic decline in LVEF, 8% to 14%.141,142 A 
meta-analysis of 10 
281 patients from 8 randomized tri-
als identified a combined RR of 5.11 for HF and 1.83 for 
LVEF decline.143
Longer-term follow-up in the Herceptin Adjuvant (HERA) 
study confirmed that most cardiac events occur during 
the first 12 months of trastuzumab exposure, while pa-
tients are undergoing active treatment.144 Short-term 
recovery occurred in the majority (80%) of the patients 
after a median of 6.4 months (range, 0–33.1 months), 
although details on the institution of specific cardiac 
medications were not clear. However, among those with 
acute recovery, roughly 30% had at least 1 subsequent 
LVEF decrease to <50%. Progressive disease and unfa-
vorable cardiac outcomes were observed in 14 of 73 
patients who had experienced a cardiac event.
Of note, patients with significant cardiovascular his-
tories were excluded in these studies; thus, the use of 
these agents in patients with established HF and clinical 
management decisions are still anecdotal and evaluated 
on an individual patient basis. Moreover, in nonclinical 
trial populations, the incidence of cardiac dysfunction 
may be higher, with 1 multicenter study of 499 pa-
tients reporting an incidence of 27%.145,146 Risk factors 
for cardiotoxicity besides prior anthracycline exposure 
include increased age, baseline LVEF ≤50%, increased 
body mass index, and use of antihypertensive medica-
tions.136,142
Pertuzumab is a recombinant monoclonal antibody 
directed against the dimerization domain of ErbB2 re-
ceptor, inhibiting ErbB2 receptor, homodimerization and 
heterodimerization. Like trastuzumab, pertuzumab is ca-
pable of inducing antibody-dependent cell-mediated cyto-
toxicity.146,147 In a phase II study of pertuzumab therapy, 
a decline in LVEF of ≥10% to <50% was observed in 8 
of 78 patients, with 2 cases of symptomatic HF.148 The 
median time to the lowest LVEF in these 8 patients was 
100 days (range, 41–175 days). On repeat assessment 
of cardiac function after 3 weeks, there was some de-
gree of LVEF recovery in all participants, as defined by 
an LVEF that was either >45% or 40% to 45% and <10% 
from baseline. A retrospective analysis of cardiac safety

data from 598 phase II study participants demonstrated 
that asymptomatic cardiac dysfunction occurred typically 
between cycles 1 and 7 in 3.4% to 6.5% of patients.147 
Continued experience with pertuzumab, particularly in 
combination with trastuzumab, will serve to further define 
the risks and natural history of pertuzumab-induced HF.
Lapatinib is an orally available dual tyrosine kinase 
inhibitor of the epidermal growth factor receptor and 
ErbB2.138 The overall incidence of HF is low. A review 
of 3689 patients who received lapatinib in 44 phase 
I to III trials revealed a 0.2% rate of symptomatic HF 
and 1.4% rate of asymptomatic cardiac events.149 Prior 
exposure to trastuzumab and anthracyclines was asso-
ciated with an increased incidence of adverse cardiac 
events, on the order of 2.2% and 1.7%, respectively. 
The time to onset was 13±9 weeks, with an absolute 
LVEF decrease of 18.8±5.2%. Again, cardiac events 
were largely observed to be reversible, although 33% 
of the patients who experienced cardiac dysfunction 
did not have a follow-up evaluation.
Bevacizumab is an antivascular endothelial growth 
factor monoclonal antibody that targets the vascular 
endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A ligand.150 In a meta-
analysis including 3784 patients, the RR for HF was 
4.74 compared with placebo, and the reported inci-
dence was 1.7% to 4%.151–153 These effects did not 
appear to be dose-dependent or clearly related to dif-
ferent concomitant chemotherapy regimens. Single-
center reports of small numbers of patients also sug-
gest that a decline in LVEF occurs early during therapy 
and is potentially reversible.154
Sunitinib is a multitargeted oral dual tyrosine kinase 
inhibitor used widely in the treatment of many can-
cers.138,155–157 This small molecule inhibits many kinases, 
including VEGF receptor, platelet-derived growth factor, 
c-kit, and fms-like tyrosine kinase-3. In a pivotal phase 
III trial comparing sunitinib with interferon-α in meta-
static renal cell cancer, 10% of the 375 patients in the 
sunitinib-treated group experienced a decline in LVEF, ac-
cording to the National Cancer Institute Common Termi-
nology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3 criteria.158 A 
meta-analysis of phase II to III clinical trials demonstrated 
an increased risk for all HF of 1.81 and high-grade HF of 
3.30.159 Retrospective clinical reports from multiple and 
single centers confirm these adverse cardiac effects. In 
a multicenter study of 175 patients, 18.9% developed 
cardiac dysfunction.160 Twelve of the 17 patients who 
developed grade 3 hypertension also developed signifi-
cant cardiac dysfunction. Cardiac dysfunction occurred 
between 28 and 180 days after the initiation of sunitinib 
and most commonly after the third cycle of therapy. Ad-
ditional clinical experience at single centers corroborate 
these findings, with a 15% incidence of National Can-
cer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events grade 3 (LVEF between 20% and 39%) or grade 
4 (LVEF<20%) cardiac dysfunction within the first 3 
months of treatment initiation.161 In the imatinib-resistant 
gastrointestinal stromal tumor population, sunitinib was 
associated with an 8% incidence of HF.156 In 36 patients 
who received the full dose of sunitinib, 10 had an LVEF 
decline of at least 10%, and 7 had LVEF reductions of 
≥15%. Independent predictors of HF were hypertension 
and coronary disease, with the effects of dose, duration, 
or biological predictors of toxicity remaining poorly de-
fined. Again, use in patients with preexistent HF has been 
limited and purely anecdotal.
The biological mechanisms of cardiotoxicity are un-
der active investigation. The VEGF receptors are clearly 
important in mediating the ventricular remodeling re-
sponse to increased afterload, as indicated by basic sci-
ence studies.162 Additional studies suggest that inhibition 
of AMP-kinase activity and the inositol-requiring enzyme 
stress response by sunitinib may play a critical role in 
mediating cardiac dysfunction.157,163 Sunitinib is believed 
to compete with adenosine triphosphate for binding to 
AMP-kinase, thereby preventing its activity and exacer-
bating energy depletion under states of increased car-
diomyocytes stress. However, there are no human-level 
data yet to support these hypotheses.156,163
Sorafenib is a small-molecule multiple tyrosine ki-
nase inhibitor that inhibits cell surface kinases, including 
VEGF receptor-2, VEGF receptor-3, and platelet-derived 
growth factor-β, and intracellular kinases such as BRAF 
and CRAF. HF is less common with sorafenib compared 
with sunitinib, and sorafenib has been used safely in pa-
tients with recovered sunitinib-induced cardiac dysfunc-
tion.164 However, this agent is associated with significant 
hypertension in 3% to 17% of treated individuals. The 
National Cancer Institute has offered a collection of 
principles to aid in the approach to treating these dual 
tyrosine kinase inhibitor–induced toxic side effects.165 
Imatinib is a kinase inhibitor that targets Bcr-Abl, with 
effects on platelet-derived growth factor-α and -β.138 
Known side effects are peripheral edema, shortness of 
breath, and fatigue. Severe HF is uncommon, occurring 
in <1% of treated patients, and hypothesized to be re-
lated to mitochondrial abnormalities and activation of the 
endoplasmic reticulum stress response system.166,167 Er-
lotinib is an epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor 
that to date has been shown not to be associated with 
significant cardiovascular toxicity.116,138,168 Many second-
generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as pazopanib, 
have emerged, and additional studies are necessary to 
understand their cardiac safety profile and use in HF.
Taxanes
The taxanes paclitaxel and docetaxel act by binding and 
disrupting microtubule function, which are highly regulat-
ed and integral components of the cellular cytoskeleton. 
The most frequent cardiac side effects of these agents 
are arrhythmias, although paclitaxel also has been as-
sociated with an increased incidence of cardiac dysfunc-

tion, most notably when administered in conjunction with 
anthracyclines.127,169 This effect may be related to a phar-
macokinetic interaction between the 2 agents whereby 
doxorubicin levels are significantly increased when ad-
ministered with paclitaxel.170 Similarly, docetaxel when 
used in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophospha-
mide is associated with a nonsignificant increase in HF 
incidence compared with nondocetaxel regimens (1.6% 
versus 0.9%; P=0.10).171 In another study comparing 
docetaxel and trastuzumab in metastatic breast cancer, 
8% of the patients treated with docetaxel alone had a 
decline in LVEF ≥15%. More than half of these patients 
were previously exposed to anthracyclines.172
Other Anticancer Medications
Thalidomide and lenalidomide are structurally similar im-
munomodulatory agents used in the treatment of multiple 
myeloma. Thalidomide has been associated with edema, 
sinus bradycardia, and venous thromboembolism.173 
Secondary to its anti-inflammatory and immunomodulat-
ing effects, thalidomide has been studied as a potential 
HF therapeutic agent with beneficial effects on LVEF and 
matrix metalloproteinase production.174 Lenalidomide 
has been associated with hypersensitivity myocarditis in 
case reports.175
Similarly, high-dose interleukin-2 has been associated 
with fulminant myocarditis, which is poorly understood 
but may be related to the capillary leak syndrome and 
cytotoxic damage from migration of lymphocytes and 
inflammatory cells to the interstitum.176 High-dose inter-
feron inhibits cell growth and upregulates immunological 
cancer defenses. Studies in animal models suggest a 
dose-dependent negative inotropic effect of interferon-α 
that may be mediated in part by nitric oxide.177 Numer-
ous cardiotoxicities, including arrhythmias, ischemia, 
infarction, and cardiomyopathy, occur during and imme-
diately after infusion.126 Cardiomyopathy is reversible af-
ter discontinuation of the infusion.178,179 Cardiomyopathy 
and HF are rare, occurring in <1% of patients.180
Hematologic Medications
Anagrelide
Anagrelide is indicated to decrease the platelet count and 
the risk of thrombosis associated with myeloprolifera-
tive disorders such as essential thrombocythemia, poly-
cythemia vera, and chronic myelogenous leukemia.181 
In addition to its pharmacological effects that decrease 
megakarocyte hypermaturation, anagrelide inhibits phos-
phodiesterase type 4, similar to milrinone and other 
positive inotropic agents. Via this pharmacological effect, 
anagrelide induces high-output HF.182 The effect appears 
to be dose related and may occur days to years after the 
drug is initiated, although a temporal association with a 
dose increase is often reported. Case reports suggest 
that anagrelide-induced HF may be reversible on discon-
tinuation of therapy.182,183
An early study with anagrelide reported common 
cardiovascular effects of palpitations, tachycardia, and 
edema, which may have actually been symptoms of high-
output HF.184 A later study quantified the incidence of 
anagrelide-induced HF as 2.4% (n=14), and 2 of these 
patients experienced sudden death.183
Cilostazol
Cilostazol is an antiplatelet and vasodilatory agent used 
primarily in patients with intermittent claudication to in-
crease walking distance.185 A selective inhibitor of phos-
phodiesterase type 3, it is believed to heighten the risk of 
fatal arrhythmias in patients with HF. It has never been di-
rectly studied in patients with HF; however, the increased 
risk is presumed to occur within 1 month of initiation be-
cause of the nature of the observed electrophysiological 
effects and extrapolation from the effects of oral milri-
none, a pharmacologically similar medication.186
It is known that cilostazol produces a dose-related in-
crease in heart rate of 5 to 7 bpm and a higher rate of 
ventricular premature beats and nonsustained ventricu-
lar tachycardia, regardless of dose received. Cilostazol 
is contraindicated in patients with HF of any severity.185
neurological and Psychiatric Medications
Stimulants
Sympathomimetic stimulants (racemic amphetamine, 
dextroamphetamine, methylphenidate, and metham-
phetamine) have similar mechanisms of action and 
are likely to have similar cardiac effects. The stimulant 
sympathomimetics can increase blood pressure by a 
few millimeters of mercury, but more concerning are 
reports of sudden death, acute coronary syndrome, 
MI, stroke, and cardiomyopathy associated with their 
use.187–196 Despite these case reports and small se-
ries documenting cardiac toxicity associated with 
stimulants, large epidemiological studies performed 
in children and adults treated with stimulants found no 
increase in the risk of serious cardiovascular events 
(stroke, MI, and sudden death).197,198 Considering the 
case reports and well-recognized risk of sympathetic 
stimulation in patients with serious cardiac disease, 
sympathomimetic stimulants are not generally used in 
patients with HF.
Antiepileptic Medications
Carbamazepine is a first-generation antiepileptic that 
is structurally similar to the tricyclic antidepressants 
(TCAs) that is also used as a mood stabilizer and for 
neuropathic pain. Carbamazepine is believed to sta-
bilize hyperexcited nerve membranes, to inhibit re-
petitive neuronal discharges, and to reduce synaptic 
propagation of excitatory impulses, possibly through 
voltage-dependent blockage of sodium channels. The

dycardia, and atrioventricular block, as well as signs 
and symptoms of HF in patients without cardiovascular 
disease.199,200 Severe LV dysfunction with a reduction 
in LVEF <35% has only been documented in cases of 
overdose.201,202
Pregabalin is an analogue of the neurotransmitter 
γ-aminobutyric acid that exhibits analgesic, anticon-
vulsant, and anxiolytic properties. In controlled clini-
cal trials, the incidence of peripheral edema was 6% 
in patients taking pregabalin compared with 2% in the 
placebo group. The possible mechanism may be antag-
onism of the L-type calcium channels, which are also 
blocked by the thiazolidinediones and dihydropyridines. 
Although data in patients with HF are limited to case 
reports, the FDA suggests caution be taken when us-
ing pregabalin in patients with NYHA class III to IV HF, 
especially in combination with thiazolidinediones, due 
to possible development of peripheral edema and HF 
exacerbation.203
Antipsychotic Medications
Several of the antipsychotic medications, both typical 
and atypical, have been associated with numerous car-
diovascular side effects consisting of significant dose-
related sudden cardiac death, cardiac arrhythmias, in 
particular TdP secondary to the corrected QT interval 
(QTc) prolongation, tachycardia, and orthostatic hypoten-
sion.204–207 Myocarditis and cardiomyopathy are rare but 
potentially fatal complications of antipsychotic therapy. 
Both disorders have been demonstrated with clozapine. 
In an analysis of reports to the Australian Adverse Drug 
Reaction Unit, the incidence rates of clozapine-induced 
myocarditis were estimated to be between 0.7% and 
1.2% over 10 years for all patients treated with clozap-
ine. This type of myocarditis occurred within the first 2 
months of beginning therapy and did not appear to be 
dose related. Of this cohort, 52% of patients recovered 
and 10% died.208
In a study of 8000 patients started on clozapine be-
tween 1993 and 1999, Kilian et al209 identified 8 cases 
of cardiomyopathy with 1 death and 15 cases of myocar-
ditis. The onset of cardiomyopathy occurred on average 
at 6 to 9 months of treatment. In 1 patient, clozapine 
discontinuation led to improvement in cardiomyopathy. 
Using data reported to the FDA, La Grenade et al210 
found that of 190 
000 patients taking clozapine between 
1989 and 1999, 28 cases of myocarditis with 18 deaths 
and 41 cases of cardiomyopathy with10 deaths were re-
ported. Although the mechanism is not fully elucidated, 
clozapine-induced cardiotoxicity may be a result of an 
IgE-mediated hypersensitivity reaction.211 Other potential 
mechanisms include elevations in catecholamine levels, 
blockade of calcium-dependent ion channels, and in-
creased production of inflammatory mediators. Numer-
ous other atypical antipsychotics without these effects 
are available.
In a case series, 3 of 5 patients with clozapine-in-
duced myocarditis demonstrated elevated brain NP lev-
els, which decreased after discontinuation of clozapine, 
in concert with alleviation of the patients’ symptoms.212 
Measuring brain NP levels may therefore offer a means 
of monitoring patients taking clozapine to detect early, 
asymptomatic myocarditis, reducing the need for regu-
lar echocardiograms.
Antidepressants
TCAs have numerous documented cardiovascular side 
effects, including sinus tachycardia and postural hypo-
tension attributed to its Class Ia antiarrhythmic activity, 
peripheral antiadrenergic action, and negative inotropic 
and α-adrenergic blocking effects.213 TCAs also affect 
atrioventricular conduction by prolonging conduction 
time in the His bundle and bundle branches, thus prolong-
ing the duration of the QRS interval and QTc interval.213 
Additionally, second- and third-degree heart block can 
develop because of the anticholinergic and quinidine-like 
properties of the TCAs, interference with reuptake of 
adrenergic amines, and direct myocardial depression.213 
Case reports have suggested that TCA use can be as-
sociated with the development of cardiomyopathy within 
weeks to years of initiation.214,215 In several small studies 
in patients with decreased LVEF, TCAs had no significant 
effects on LVEF; however, long-term information on the 
effect on ventricular performance and development of 
new-onset HF is limited.216–219
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have a very 
low rate of adverse cardiovascular effects. In prospec-
tive studies of patients with HF, post-MI, or unstable an-
gina, fluoxetine, sertraline, paroxetine, and fluvoxamine 
had minimal to no effect on electrocardiographic and 
echocardiographic indexes of cardiac function.220–223 
However, like the TCAs, some selective serotonin reup-
take inhibitors may prolong the QTc. In 2011, the FDA 
issued a safety announcement that citalopram should 
not exceed 40 mg/d because of the risk of dose-de-
pendent QTc prolongation, which could lead to TdP in 
which HF was listed as a risk factor.224 Additionally, the 
FDA recommended avoiding use in patients with de-
compensated HF.
Antiparkinson Medications
Pergolide is an ergot-derived dopamine receptor ago-
nist with potent agonism of the 5-hydroxytryptamine 2B 
receptor. After the publication of several case reports, 
comparative studies reported heart valve disease as-
sociated with pergolide.225–231 In a large case-control 
study of 155 patients with Parkinson disease, Zanettini 
et al228 found that patients receiving either pergolide 
or cabergoline had a significantly greater frequency of 
moderate to severe grade 3 to 4 regurgitation in any 
valve compared with those not receiving a dopamine

receptor agonist (23.4% versus 28.6% versus 0%, re-
spectively). The RR for moderate or severe valve re-
gurgitation in the pergolide group was 6.3 for mitral 
regurgitation (P=0.008), 4.2 for aortic regurgitation 
(P=0.001), and 5.6 for tricuspid regurgitation (P=0.16) 
compared with other groups. Corvol et al232 also dem-
onstrated similar findings in a meta-analysis of 7 trials 
(394 patients treated with pergolide and 280 control 
subjects). Overall, the odds of developing moderate to 
serve regurgitation were 3-fold higher in those receiv-
ing pergolide compared with those in the control group 
(OR, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.7–5.6; P<0.001). In both studies, 
higher risk for valvular disease correlated with a higher 
mean cumulative pergolide dose. In 2007, pergolide 
was removed from the US market, but it remains avail-
able in Europe.
Bromocriptine is also an ergot-derived dopamine ago-
nist but has only partial agonist activity at the 5-hydroxy-
tryptamine 2B receptor. Although exposure has been as-
sociated with valvular heart disease, the data are limited 
to case reports and a few prospective studies.233–235 In 
a case-control study of 140 patients with Parkinson dis-
ease receiving either bromocriptine (n=71) or pergolide 
(n=21), Tan et al235 found the risk for any abnormal valvu-
lar regurgitation to be 3.2-fold higher for those receiving 
bromocriptine (OR, 3.32; 95% CI, 1.11–9.92; P=0.03) 
and 3.7-fold higher for those receiving pergolide (OR, 
3.66; 95% CI, 1.22–10.97; P=0.02) compared with 
age-matched controls (n=47). The postulated mecha-
nism has been stimulation of the 5-hydroxytryptamine 
2B receptor expressed on the heart valve, which may 
induce fibrotic changes, leading to valve thickening and 
stiffening.235
Recently, 2 large, population-based, epidemiological 
studies did not find a significant increase in new-onset 
HF with either pergolide or bromocriptine but did with 
the non–ergot-derived dopamine agonist pramipexole, 
especially within the first 3 months of therapy and in pa-
tients ≥80 years of age.236,237 Additionally, in a pooled 
analysis of randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel 
phase II and III clinical trials, the FDA calculated the 
incidence of newly diagnosed HF to be more frequent, 
although not significant, in patients taking pramipexole 
(n=12 of 4157) compared with those taking placebo 
(n=4 of 2820).238 On the basis of these data, the FDA 
issued a Drug Safety Communication to providers on 
this association.
Antimigraine Medications
Methysergide and ergotamine are both ergot deriva-
tives used in the treatment of migraines. Ergotamine is 
an α-adrenergic blocking agent with direct stimulating 
effects on the smooth muscle of the peripheral and 
cranial blood vessels and serotonin antagonistic prop-
erties. Methysergide is a potent peripheral inhibitor 
of 5-hydroxytryptamine, demonstrating a competitive 
blockade of vascular 5-hydroxytryptamine receptors, 
but is a central 5-hydroxytryptamine agonist, primarily 
at therapeutic nuclei. Several case reports have found 
both drugs to be associated with mitral, aortic, and 
tricuspid valve lesions that in some cases led to right-
sided HF.239–242 The onset of these findings occurred 
typically after years of long-term administration, and 
the valve abnormalities did not completely resolve on 
drug discontinuation.243 The mechanism of the valve 
fibrosis is thought to be related to excess serotonin 
activity because both methysergide and ergotamine 
are partial serotonin agonists.242 With the advent of 
newer agents to acutely treat migraines (eg, triptans), 
both methysergide and ergotamine should be avoided. 
According to the Triptan Cardiovascular Safety Expert 
Panel, the safety profile of triptans is well defined and 
appears to reflect a very low risk of serious cardio-
vascular adverse events in patients without known or 
suspected coronary artery disease.244
Appetite Suppressants
Fenfluramine and its d-isomer, dexfenfluramine, when 
used alone or in combination with another appetite sup-
pressant, phentermine, can cause pulmonary hyper-
tension and cardiac valve abnormalities.245–247 These 
agents appear to promote the rapid release of serotonin 
and to inhibit its reuptake, but they also exert serotonin 
receptor agonist activity. Valvular regurgitation occurred 
in 12% of patients treated for >90 days compared with 
5.9% of unexposed patients (OR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.7–2.7). 
Fenfluramine and dexfenfluramine have been withdrawn 
from the market. Rare cases of valvulopathy and pul-
monary hypertension have been submitted to the FDA 
in patients who reportedly took phentermine alone.248 
Another appetite suppressant, sibutramine, was with-
drawn from the market for increased risk of nonfatal MI 
and stroke.249
Bipolar Medications
Lithium is a mood stabilizer that alters sodium transport 
in nerve and muscle cells, resulting in intraneuronal me-
tabolism of catecholamines. In single case reports and 
case series, lithium salts have been associated with 
severe cardiac side effects, including bradyarrhythmias 
caused by sinus node dysfunction, premature ventricu-
lar beats, atrioventricular block, T-wave depression, in-
terstitial myocarditis, and cardiomyopathy.250–257 Stanc-
er and Kivi258 reported 5 patients with edema during 
lithium carbonate use; 2 of these patients developed 
new-onset HF. In the majority of these cases, lithium 
was within its therapeutic serum concentration range 
(0.6–1.2 mEq/L), and the cardiotoxicity resolved on 
lithium discontinuation. Although still unclear, the po-
tential mechanisms of these cardiotoxicities consist of 
myofibrillar degeneration with myocardial lymphocyte 
cell infiltration, adrenergic stimulation, and interference 
with calcium ion influx in pacing cells.255,257 Alternative

agents for the treatment of bipolar disease such as 
valproic acid or lamotrigine are available.
ophthalmological Agents
β-Blockers
Topical β-blockers are the best studied with regard to 
hemodynamic effects. Small case series evaluating 
topical timolol usually involving young healthy volunteers 
have variably demonstrated changes in blood pressure 
and heart rate, which have been considered clinically in-
significant.259–261 However, several case series and case 
reports with topical β-blockers, primarily timolol, have 
demonstrated clinically significant issues in patients with 
HF, including arrhythmias such as bradycardia, myocar-
dial ischemia, hypotension, and pulmonary edema.262,263 
In 2 HF patients, topical timolol administration led to an 
exacerbation of symptoms of HF.263 Discontinuation or 
dose reduction of the ophthalmic β-blocker led to rapid 
resolution of cardiac side effects.263
Cholinergic Agonists
Cholinergic agonists, including cholinesterase inhibitors, 
have been associated with changes in heart rate, includ-
ing atrioventricular block, but this effect appears uncom-
mon with the caveat that this class appears to be the 
least studied.262,264
Pulmonary Agents
β2-Agonists
Several small studies have suggested an association with 
 
β2-agonist use and cardiotoxicity. In a retrospec-
tive case-control study, Coughlin et al265 dem-
onstrated a 3-fold increase in the risk of cardio-
myopathy with the use of systemic or inhaled 
 
β2-agonist. Although other studies have not confirmed 
this association, Au et al266 identified a dose-related in-
crease in risk for hospital admission with deteriorating 
HF in patients with HF with reduced EF using inhaled 
β2-agonists (1–2 canisters per month: adjusted OR, 1.8; 
95% CI, 1.1–3.0; ≥3 canisters per month: adjusted OR, 
2.1; 95% CI, 1.2–3.8). Bouvy et al267 also found an in-
creased risk of hospitalization for ventricular arrhythmia 
(OR, 4.0; 95% CI, 1.0–15.1) in patients receiving β2-
agonists, an effect that was higher in patients receiving 
systemic compared with inhaled formulations. Although 
β2-agonists are known to exert small positive inotropic 
and chronotropic effects on the heart, the proposed 
mechanism of this association has been that regular 
exposure to β2-agonists could lead to decreased recep-
tor responsiveness, which could theoretically lead to HF 
deterioration.268
Bosentan and Epoprostenol
Both epoprostenol, an intravenous prostaglandin, and 
bosentan, an oral endothelin-1 antagonist, are used in the 
management of patients with pulmonary hypertension. In 
FIRST (Randomized Controlled Trial of Epoprostenol Ther-
apy for Severe Congestive Heart Failure: The Flolan In-
ternational Randomized Survival Trial), epoprostenol was 
associated with an increased risk of death in patients with 
NYHA class IIIB/IV HF and therefore is contraindicated 
for long-term use in patients with HF with reduced EF.269 
In pooled, placebo-controlled studies lasting between 4 
weeks and 6 months, leg edema was reported in 5% of 
patients receiving between 100 and 2000 mg daily of 
bosentan (n=677) compared with 1% of patients receiv-
ing placebo (n=288).270 During the first 4 to 8 weeks, 
patients with severe HF were at increased risk of hospi-
talization because of weight gain and increased leg ede-
ma. Long-term studies in patients with symptomatic HF 
have been conducted: REACH (Research on Endothelin 
Antagonism in Chronic Heart Failure) and ENABLE (Endo-
thelin Antagonist Bosentan for Lowering Cardiac Events 
in Heart Failure) trials. The REACH trial was stopped pre-
maturely because of elevations in hepatic transaminases. 
It demonstrated an increased risk of death or worsening 
HF in the bosentan group within the first month of therapy 
but not at months 4 to 6.271,272 The ENABLE trial found 
similar findings in which bosentan appeared to confer an 
early risk of worsening HF that warranted hospitalization 
related to fluid retention.273
rheumatological Medications
Tumor Necrosis Factor-α Inhibitors
The tumor necrosis factor-α inhibitors infliximab, etaner-
cept, and adalimumab play a major role in the manage-
ment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn dis-
ease; however, postmarketing data have suggested that 
these medications can be associated with new-onset or 
worsening HF. In the RENAISSANCE (Randomized Etan-
ercept North American Strategy to Study Antagonism of 
Cytokines) and RECOVER (Research into Etanercept Cy-
tokine Antagonism in Ventricular Dysfunction) trials, etan-
ercept had no impact on the clinical status in patients 
with NYHA class II, III, or IV HF compared with control 
subjects.274 In the ATTACH trial (Anti-TNF Alpha Therapy 
Against CHF), higher rates of HF-related hospitalization 
or death were noted in the patients with NHYA class III 
or IV HF receiving infliximab 10 mg/kg compared with 
the 5-mg/kg dose (HR, 2.84; 95% CI, 1.01–7.97).275 
However, a recent systematic review in patients with 
rheumatoid arthritis and HF that included observational 
studies and a meta-analysis found no increase in the risk 
of incident or worsening HF in patients treated with tu-
mor necrosis factor-α inhibitors (infliximab, etanercept, 
and adalimumab) except for patients ≥65 years of age, 
who had a higher risk of HF hospitalization (HR, 1.7; 
95% CI, 1.07–2.69) and death (HR, 4.19; 95% CI, 1.48–
11.89).276  The 2015 American College of Rheumatol-

mend that a tumor necrosis factor-α inhibitor should only 
be considered in patients with HF if there are no other 
reasonable treatment options, and then consider only in 
patients with compensated HF.277
Antimalarial Agents
Hydroxychloroquine is an antimalarial that has become 
a mainstay in the management of systemic lupus ery-
thematosus and rheumatoid arthritis. Similar to chloro-
quine in structure, hydroxychloroquine is used more fre-
quently because it has less toxicity. More than 70 cases 
of cardiotoxicity have been reported with these agents 
in which chloroquine has primarily been implicated.278 
Cardiotoxicity manifests as restrictive or dilated car-
diomyopathy or with conduction system abnormalities 
such as atrioventricular and bundle-branch block.279,280 
Because both chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are 
cationic amphiliphilic drugs, they are hypothesized to 
bind to phospholipids within the myocyte, accumulat-
ing in the lysosomes and inhibiting lysosomal enzymes. 
This impairs intracellular degradation and leads to ac-
cumulation of pathological metabolic products such as 
phospholipid and glycogen.279,280 On histology, these 
appear as granulovacular cell mutations and ultrastruc-
turally as lamellar membranous inclusion bodies and 
curvilinear bodies in the cytoplasm. Prognosis can vary 
from death to cardiac transplantation to partial or com-
plete improvement within 1 month to 1 year on medica-
tion discontinuation. Risk factors consist of older age, 
female sex, longer duration of therapy (3 months–27 
years; mean >10 years), elevated milligram per kilo-
gram daily dose, preexisting cardiac disease, and renal 
insufficiency.279,280
Urological Medications
α1-Blockers
Limited data exist on the specific use of the uroselec-
tive (eg, tamsulosin) and nonuroselective (eg, prazosin, 
terazosin, doxazosin) α1-blockers in the management of 
benign prostatic hypertrophy for patients with HF. In the 
case of the nonuroselective agents, which have greater 
systemic α-blockade effects, much of the evidence has 
been extrapolated from the results of ALLHAT and Ve-
HFT-1.71,73 In a retrospective analysis of 388 patients with 
HF and benign prostatic hypertrophy receiving prazosin, 
terazosin, doxazosin, or tamsulosin, Dhaliwal et al281  
found no significant increase in all-cause mortality 
and HF rehospitalization in those receiving β-blockers. 
However, in those not receiving β-blockade, α-blockade 
exposure was associated with an increase in HF hospi-
talization (HR, 1.94; 95% CI, 1.14–3.32). Of note, the 
majority of patients were receiving tamsulosin (58%). 
It has been hypothesized that unopposed α1 blockade 
could lead to β1-receptor stimulation with increases in 
renin and aldosterone, leading to edema and weight 
gain.281 Chronic α1 antagonism may lead to tachyphy-
laxis with a loss of hemodynamic benefits and gradual 
increases in norepinephrine. In VeHFT-1, reported in 
1986 before the use of β-blockers for HF, prazosin did 
not affect overall mortality compared with placebo, but 
no data on HF hospitalizations were reported.73 Despite 
uncertainty about the mechanism, the balance of data 
suggest that α1-blockers may exacerbate HF in those 
with established disease, perhaps even with uroselec-
tive agents.
Erectile Dysfunction Medications
On the basis of findings from a single HF center, at least 
75% of men with HF admitted to experiencing erectile 
dysfunction, regardless of the cause of their HF.282 Silde-
nafil, vardenafil, and tadalfil are all selective inhibitors of 
cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase type 5, which increas-
es the amount of cGMP that relaxes the smooth muscle 
of the corpus cavernosum. However, these agents may 
increase the hypotensive effects of nitrates and are con-
traindicated with concomitant nitrates.282 Additionally, 
this effect would be expected to be seen if these agents 
are combined with other phosphodiesterase inhibitors 
such as milrinone.

QT-Prolonging Medications
Drug-induced prolongation of the QT interval is a signifi-
cant and potentially dangerous drug toxicity that can lead 
to the polymorphic ventricular tachycardia TdP. Numer-
ous drugs from various therapeutic classes have been 
implicated in prolonging the QT interval, including antibi-
otics, antidepressants, antipsychotics, and antiemetics, 
all of which are commonly used by patients with HF.283,284 
Numerous risk factors exist for drug-induced QT inter-
val prolongation that potentially leads to TdP such as 
hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, bradycardia, genetic 
predisposition, female sex, and use of drugs that either 
prolong the QT interval or disrupt the metabolism or dis-
tribution of QT-prolonging drugs. HF is a risk factor for 
TdP because of frequent prolongation of the QT interval 
and diuretic-induced hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia. 
CredibleMeds, a program of the Arizona Center for Edu-
cation and Research on Therapeutics, maintains an evi-
dence-based list of potential QT-prolonging medications 
stratified by their risk of TdP (risk, possible, conditional, 
and avoided). Table 5 summarizes these medications 
and their effects.285
Sodium-Containing Medications

with HF. Consideration is often given to dietary sodium 
restriction; however, evaluation of nondietary sources

may not be considered. Not only is sodium chloride 
often a common vehicle for administration of intra-
venous medications, but many medications adminis-
tered in the inpatient setting may also be high in so-
dium. In a retrospective, single-center analysis of 82 
patients admitted to the cardiac intensive care unit for 
acute HF exacerbation, the mean nondietary sodium 
load was 4.0±5.0 g/d, which was correlated with an 
increase in hospital stay.286 An average of 1.2 g of 
daily nondietary sodium correlated with hospital stays 
of up to 5 days, whereas an average of 2.6 g/d led 
to stays of up to 10 days.286 Table 6 summarizes the 
sodium content for both intravenous and oral prescrip-
tion medications that could be used in the inpatient or

oTC MEDiCATionS
Currently, 35% of adult Americans use an OTC medi-
cation on a regular basis. In a 2011 survey (n=1880), 
the most common choice of products for ailments 
such as headache, heartburn, allergies, and cough/
cold was OTC medications. Unfortunately, one third of 
Americans admit that they have taken more than the 
recommended dose of an OTC product, and only half 
report reviewing the package labeling before using an 
OTC product for the first time.302 OTC NSAIDs, like 
their prescription counterparts, can exacerbate HF 
and increase the risk for HF hospitalization particularly 
when taken at higher doses.18 Many OTC medications 
have high sodium content or have actions that could 
exacerbate HF or common comorbid conditions. For 
example, many cough, cold, and allergy and sinus 
preparations may have NSAIDs such as ibuprofen 
or vasoconstrictors such as phenylephrine or pseu-
doephedrine. Because both phenylephrine and pseu-
doephedrine exert their effects on adrenergic recep-
tors, cardiotoxicity such as myocardial ischemia, MI, 
stroke, and arrhythmias can be seen with high dose 
and prolonged, excessive use.303,304 Pepto-Bismol 
contains 261 mg/30 mL and 99 mg per tablet of sa-
licylate.305 Nasal decongestants typically contain oxy-
metazoline, phenylephrine, and the ocular deconges-
tant naphazoline, all of which are vasoconstrictors. 
When these agents are topically applied, case reports 
have suggested that excessive use or prolonged ex-
posure beyond package labeling can lead to systemic 
exposure resulting in stroke, hypertension, and brady-
cardia.306–309 Inhaled and oral OTC asthma products 
may contain potent nonselective sympathomimetic 
amines such as racepinephrine and ephedrine, and 
they have been associated with chest pain, hyperten-
sion, tachycardia, and hemoptysis.310–313
Many of the newer aluminum- and magnesium-contain-
ing antacids have minimal to no sodium; however, other 
products for cough/cold and gastrointestinal ailments 
may contain sodium. Nyquil and Dayquil contain 37 and 
15 mg/30 mL, respectively, of sodium.314,315 Gaviscon 
has 52 mg of sodium per 15 mL, which, if the recom-
mended 30-mL dose is taken 4 times daily, equates to 
>400 mg of sodium per day.316
Because OTC product formulation can rapidly 
change from year to year, it is valuable for patients 
to be taught to read and evaluate OTC labels. Unfortu-
nately, many inactive ingredients such as sodium and 
sodium bicarbonate may be difficult to find in the pack-
age labeling.

The incorporation of naturoceutical products into stan-
dard medical practice is handicapped by a dearth of 
quality efficacy and safety data. In addition, there is no 
rigorous oversight for their manufacture, and adulter-
ated products abound. However, these shortcomings 
do not inhibit the availability of these products for retail 
and Internet sale, and most individuals believe that the 
US government regulates these products.317
In a 2007 national survey, it was observed that 
38% of adults in the United States use CAMs. This 
phenomenon is not isolated to the young or middle-
aged; 1 in 4 individuals >85 years of age reported the 
use of at least 1 CAM therapy.318 This underscores the 
importance of the 2010 HF practice guidelines, which 
state “documentation of the type and dose of naturo-
ceutical products used by patients with HF is recom-
mended” to facilitate an individualized assessment of 
risk to benefit.319 These guidelines further recommend 
3 specific measures concerning these products in pa-
tients with HF:
1.  
No naturoceutical should be used for the manage-
ment of HF symptoms or the secondary prevention 
of cardiovascular events.
2.  
Ephedra-like products (ma-haung) should be 
avoided because of their stimulant effects on 
blood pressure and heart rate and their increased 
risk of mortality and morbidity.
3.  
Products with significant interactions with digoxin, 
vasodilators, β-blockers, antiarrhythmic agents, and 
anticoagulants should be avoided (Tables 7 and 8320).
The American College of Cardiology Foundation/
American Heart Association HF guidelines recommend 
that nutritional supplements not be used for the treat-
ment of HF.13
There is evidence that supplementation with vitamin 
E ≥400 IU/d may increase the risk of developing new-
onset HF; it seems prudent to avoid it in individuals with 
established HF. Post hoc analyses of large, long-term,

Known risk of TdP: These drugs prolong the QT interval and are clearly associated with a known risk of TdP, even when taken as recommended. Possible 
risk of TdP: These drugs can cause QT prolongation but currently lack evidence for a risk of TdP when taken as recommended. Conditional risk of TdP: 
These drugs are associated with TdP but only under certain circumstances of their use (eg, excessive dose, in patients such as those with hypokalemia, or 
when taken with interacting drugs) or by creating conditions that facilitate or induce TdP (eg, by inhibiting metabolism of a QT-prolonging drug or by causing 
an electrolyte disturbance that induces TdP). Drugs to avoid in congenital long QT: These drugs pose a special risk of TdP for patients with congenital long-
QT syndrome and include those in the above 3 categories plus additional drugs that do not prolong the QT interval per se but have a special risk because 
of their adrenaline-like actions. HCTZ indicates hydrochlorothiazide; QT, QT interval; and TdP, torsades de pointes.

randomized trials involving vitamin E suggest that car-

HF, 1 study reported a 21% increased risk for hospi-
talization for HF compared with placebo, and a second 
study reported up to a 50% increased risk for develop-
ing clinically overt HF compared with placebo.321,322

tive statements can be made about the safe use of

most CAM products in patients with HF. Even for the 
products with mostly modest benefit for a noncardiac 
condition, the possibility of off-target effects harm-
ful to patients with HF exists. On the basis of what 
is known about their side effects in healthy people 
and the mechanism of action, many of these thera-
pies have plausible risks if used in patients with HF 
(Table 9).320
SUMMAry AnD rECoMMEnDATionS
Polypharmacy is a significant concern in patients 
with HF because of the burden of both cardiovascu-
lar and noncardiovascular conditions. It is not unusual 
to have medications ordered and adjusted by different 
clinicians, many times with minimal consideration for 
drug-drug or drug-condition interactions, or to have 
prescriptions filled at different pharmacies. The follow-
ing strategies may be helpful in detecting inappropri-
ate and potentially hazardous medications that could 
exacerbate HF.
Considerations for Minimizing Polypharmacy and 
improving Drug Safety
1.  
Healthcare providers should conduct com-
prehensive medication reconciliation at each 
clinical visit and with each admission. Patients 
should be specifically asked about drug, dose, 
and frequency of all their medications, includ-
ing Otc medications and cAMs. If possible, 
these should be verified with the pharmacy or 
prescriber323 (Class I; Level of Evidence B).

2.  
Although not associated with improved out-
come, the use of complexity tools may be 
considered to identify issues within a medi-
cation regimen324,325 (Class IIb; Level of 
Evidence C).
3.  
It can be beneficial to implement a medica-
tion flow sheet and to update it at each visit. 
this flow sheet may include any laboratory 
tests needed for specific medications such 
as warfarin or amiodarone. It can be use-
ful to provide patients with a copy of this 
final list and to encourage them to carry it 
with them at all times326 (Class IIa; Level of 
Evidence C).
4.  
Evaluating the potential risks and benefits of 
each medication should be considered before 
initiation. Medications should be categorized 
as either essential to desired outcomes or 
optional, with an attempt made to reduce or 
eliminate optional medications327,328 (Class I; 
Level of Evidence C).
5.  
It is reasonable to discontinue medications 
that do not have an indication or are contrain-
dicated327–329 (Class IIa; Level of Evidence C).
6.  
When possible and affordable, it is reason-
able to consider combination medications to 
reduce the number of medications taken daily 
or medications that can be used to treat >1 
condition327 (Class IIa; Level of Evidence C).
7.  
It is reasonable to consider avoiding pre-
scribing new medications to treat side effects 
of other medications. the use of as-needed 
medications should be limited to only those 
that are absolutely necessary327–329 (Class IIa; 
Level of Evidence C).
8.  
It can be beneficial to educate patients on 
the following aspects of Otc medications and 
cAMs: communicate with their healthcare 
provider first before taking any Otc medica-
tions and cAMs; avoid the use of Otc medi-
cations and cAMs with uncertain efficacy and 
safety; and evaluate all labels of Otc medi-
cations and cAMs for sodium content327,330 
(Class IIa; Level of Evidence C).
9.  
It is reasonable to establish a team manage-
ment approach in which a healthcare pro-
vider acts as “captain” of the medications 
and instructs patients to notify this individual 
whenever a medication is changed or added 
to the medication list. Ideally, this call should 
made before the product is purchased or 
the prescription is filled330 (Class IIa, Level of 
Evidence C).

This table represents the relationships of writing group members that may be perceived as actual or reasonably perceived conflicts of interest as 
reported on the Disclosure Questionnaire, which all members of the writing group are required to complete and submit. A relationship is considered to be 
“significant” if (a) the person receives $10 000 or more during any 12-month period, or 5% or more of the person’s gross income; or (b) the person owns 
5% or more of the voting stock or share of the entity, or owns $10 000 or more of the fair market value of the entity. A relationship is considered to be 
“modest” if it is less than “significant” under the preceding definition.

This table represents the relationships of reviewers that may be perceived as actual or reasonably perceived conflicts of interest as reported on the 
Disclosure Questionnaire, which all reviewers are required to complete and submit. A relationship is considered to be “significant” if (a) the person receives 
$10 000 or more during any 12-month period, or 5% or more of the person’s gross income; or (b) the person owns 5% or more of the voting stock or 
share of the entity, or owns $10 000 or more of the fair market value of the entity. A relationship is considered to be “modest” if it is less than “significant” 
under the preceding definition.
