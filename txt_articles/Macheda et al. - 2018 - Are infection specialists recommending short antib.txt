Received 7 September 2017; returned 22 November 2017; revised 1 December 2017; accepted 18 December 2017
Objectives: To evaluate the current practice and the willingness to shorten the duration of antibiotic therapy
among infection specialists.
Methods: Infection specialists giving at least weekly advice on antibiotic prescriptions were invited to participate
in an online cross-sectional survey between September and December 2016. The questionnaire included 15 clini-
cal vignettes corresponding to common clinical cases with favourable outcomes; part A asked about the antibi-
otic treatment duration they would usually advise to prescribers and part B asked about the shortest duration
they were willing to recommend.
Results: We included 866 participants, mostly clinical microbiologists (22.8%, 197/863) or infectious diseases
specialists (58.7%, 507/863), members of an antibiotic stewardship team in 73% (624/854) of the cases, coming
from 58 countries on all continents. Thirty-six percent of participants (271/749) already advised short durations
of antibiotic therapy (compared with the literature) to prescribers for more than half of the vignettes and 47%
(312/662) chose shorter durations in part B compared with part A for more than half of the vignettes. Twenty-
two percent (192/861) of the participants declared that their regional/national guidelines expressed durations of
antibiotic therapy for a specific clinical situation as a fixed duration as opposed to a range and in the multivari-
able analysis this was associated with respondents advising short durations for more than half of the vignettes
(adjusted OR 1.5, P " 0.02).
Conclusions: The majority of infection specialists currently do not advise the shortest possible duration of antibi-
otic therapy to prescribers. Promoting short durations among these experts is urgently needed.
Introduction
Using the shortest possible duration of antibiotic treatment is a key
component of responsible antibiotic use,1–3 with some studies sug-
gesting that shortened durations can limit the emergence of bac-
terial resistance,4–6 without compromising clinical outcomes.7–15
Most antibiotic stewardship guidelines recommend that stew-
ardship teams implement guidelines and strategies to promote
the shortest effective duration of antibiotic therapy.6,16 No study
has, however, explored the current practices of infection special-
ists, who are often members of an antibiotic stewardship team,
regarding duration of antibiotic therapy.
The objective of our international cross-sectional survey was thus
to describe current practices of infection specialists as well as their
willingness to shorten the duration of antibiotic therapy. Our hypoth-
esis was that not all of them are ready to advise short durations and

 this could be a barrier to implementation of guidelines and strategies
promoting short durations of antibiotic therapy.
Methods
Study design
ESGAP (ESCMID Study Group for Antimicrobial stewardshiP) and SPILF
(French Infectious Diseases Society) conducted a cross-sectional interna-
tional Internet-based survey on duration of antibiotic treatments. Hospital-
based healthcare professionals (fully trained or in training) who were giving
at least weekly advice to colleagues (outside their home department) on
their antibiotic prescriptions could participate in this survey.
Survey instrument
The 25-item questionnaire was developed by a multidisciplinary
group of experts in infectious diseases, microbiology and public
health,
based
on
a
literature
review
(File
S1,
available
as
Supplementary data at JAC Online).17 It was first pilot-tested among
ESGAP and SPILF Executive Committee members to check for clarity
and conciseness.
The questionnaire first collected information on respondents’ character-
istics (nine questions) and then comprised two parts: (A) the usual practice
of respondents regarding recommendations they make to clinicians in their
hospital or in primary care (outside their own department) regarding total
durations of antibiotic treatment; and (B) the shortest total duration that
they would be willing to recommend for the same cases. Parts A and B used
the same 15 clinical vignettes, each one describing a specific disease,
assuming for each a ‘best case scenario’, i.e. that an appropriate antibiotic
was prescribed (in terms of choice of molecule, dose and interval of admin-
istration) and that the outcome was favourable under this treatment.
The participants were only informed that the survey was about duration of
antibiotic treatments and so they were not aware whilst completing part A
on usual practices that they would subsequently be asked in part B about
willingness to shorten durations.

 Survey distribution
The survey used the SurveyMonkey
V
R platform and stayed open from
September 2016 to December 2016, with one reminder sent in November.
It was advertised using the ESCMID Newsletter, as well as ESGAP and SPILF
networks. Participation was voluntary, anonymous and without any com-
pensation. According to regulations, ethics approval was not required.
Statistical analysis
Respondents’ demographic and professional characteristics were first
described as numbers and percentages. For each clinical vignette, the usual
recommended duration of antibiotic therapy as well as the shortest dura-
tion that respondents were willing to recommend were presented as
medians (in days). These last results were also presented by country for the
countries with more than 10 respondents.
For each of the 15 vignettes, short treatment durations were defined
based on a literature review17 and a consensus among all authors (File S2).
Demographic and professional characteristics associated with (i) rec-
ommending short durations in more than 50% of the vignettes and (ii)
the willingness to shorten treatment durations (durations recommended
in part B of the questionnaire compared with those recommended in part
A) in more than 50% of the vignettes were identified by using bivariate
and multivariable logistic regression models. Respondents with missing
data for 8 or more of the 15 clinical vignettes were not considered
in these analyses. As our work was exploratory, since no risk factor associ-
ated with short durations of antibiotic therapy was available in the litera-
ture, we decided a priori that all eight individual characteristics would
be entered in these models, except the country. Variables reaching
a threshold of P , 0.20 in bivariate analyses were then entered in the
multivariable model, with P , 0.05 being considered significant using
two-sided tests. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS
V
R version
9.4 (SAS
V
R Institute, Inc., Cary, NC, USA).
Results
Sample characteristics
Of the 1053 people who responded to the survey, 136 were
not eligible because they gave advice less than once a week on
antibiotics and 51 were excluded because they did not answer
the clinical vignettes. We included 866 participants from

 58 countries (Figure S1), mostly from France (19.1%, 165/866),
UK (15.7%, 136/866), Spain (9.5%, 82/866) and Germany
(9.1%, 79/866). The main characteristics of the respondents are
presented in Table 1.
Usual practice and shortest durations
The participants’ usual recommendations they make to clinicians
regarding durations of antibiotic treatment and the shortest dura-
tions they would be willing to recommend for the same 15 clinical
vignettes are presented in Table 2.
Table S1 presents for each vignette the percentage of respond-
ents who were willing to choose a shorter duration (in part B of the
questionnaire compared with part A) and shows that this ranged
from 33.3% (220/661) for the Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia
vignette to 62.7% (402/641) for the erysipelas one.
Factors associated with short treatment duration
Overall, 86.5% (749/866) of respondents were eligible for the study
factors associated with usual short treatment duration. Among
these respondents, 36.2% (271/749) recommended a short
duration in more than 50% of the vignettes and 4.1% (31/749)
recommended a short duration in more than 75% of the vignettes.
Among all answers (749 respondents replying to 8–15
vignettes), short durations of antibiotic therapy were recom-
mended in 42.7% (3838/8988) of cases.
Table 3 presents the factors associated with a participant
recommending a short duration in more than 50% of the
vignettes. In multivariable analysis, being a man (aOR " 1.6,
P " 0.002), a clinical pharmacist (aOR " 2.0, P " 0.039) and
having fixed durations of antibiotic treatment in regional/
national guidelines (aOR " 1.5, P " 0.02) were all independently
associated with such behaviour.

 Factors associated with the willingness to shorten
treatment duration
Overall, 76.4% (662/866) of respondents were eligible for the
study factors associated with the willingness to shorten treatment
duration. Among them, 47.1% (312/662) were willing to shorten
treatment duration for at least 50% of the clinical vignettes.
Table 4 presents the factors associated with shortened dura-
tions in part B of the questionnaire (compared with part A) in more
than 50% of the vignettes. In multivariable analysis, being a man
(aOR" 1.7, P " 0.002) or an infectious diseases specialist (aOR
versus clinical pharmacists" 3.3, P " 0.007) was independently
associated with such behaviour.
Results by country
We received 10 or more responses from 27.6% (16/58) of the partici-
pating countries. Table 5 shows the wide variations between these
countries in terms of the proportion of treatments that are usually
recommended to be short and in willingness to shorten durations.
Discussion
Our large survey included 866 infection specialists, mostly (82%)
clinical microbiologists or infectious diseases specialists, members
of an antibiotic stewardship team in 73% of the cases, coming
from all continents. More than a third of participants already
frequently advised short durations of antibiotic therapy to prescrib-
ers and almost half of the participants were willing to shorten
durations.
Twenty-two percent of the participants stated that their
regional/national guidelines expressed durations of antibiotic ther-
apy for a specific clinical situation as a fixed duration (e.g. 5 days),
as opposed to a range (e.g. 5–10days), and this was associated
with usually recommending short durations in multivariable analy-
sis. If a range is used, it is possible that prescribers feel more com-
fortable choosing a value in the middle of the range, or the longest
duration, even if the intention of the range is to suggest that the
shortest duration would be adequate for most patients. Based on
our results, we suggest exploring the impact of fixed durations of
antibiotic treatment in guidelines.
It is encouraging that almost half of the participants were
ready to shorten durations of treatment, as it suggests that
these infection specialists, who are frequently antibiotic stew-
ards, are ready to promote strategies aimed at reducing dura-
tion of antibiotic therapy. Nevertheless, our results also show
that the rest of the participants, who represent the majority,
should be the target of specific educational and awareness ini-
tiatives, if they are to act as leaders and role models to promote
such a strategy. This is important considering that only a third
of respondents already advise short durations. Furthermore,
being an antibiotic stewardship team member was not associ-
ated with short/shortening durations and this was quite unex-
pected since these are the people who should be most aware of
current evidence. Issuing specific evidence-based guidelines at
the national level is probably useful as a first step, as was done
by the French Infectious Diseases Society.17 Implementing
interventions targeting as a priority the most frequent and/or
non-severe infections could then lead to a large reduction in
total antibiotic use. Country-specific barriers should be taken
into account, as suggested by the large variations between
countries we observed.
Our large survey presents original findings, but has some limita-
tions. The majority (58%) of respondents came from university
public hospitals and most respondents (73%) were members of an
antibiotic stewardship team, limiting the generalizability to the
general infection specialists’ community; moreover, around half of
the responses came from four countries (France, UK, Spain and
Germany) and it is possible that the most motivated or knowledge-
able infection specialists participated, which might limit the gener-
alizability of our results. Although vignettes have been shown to be
a valid tool for assessing healthcare professionals’ practices,18
responses do not necessarily reflect the daily practices of
respondents.
Conclusions
Our survey shows that the majority of antibiotic stewards currently
do not advise the shortest possible duration of antibiotic therapy
to prescribers in many different clinical scenarios. However, half of
them are willing to shorten those durations. Implementing a strat-
egy to shorten antibiotic durations must first involve training anti-
biotic stewardship members, as well as studying the impact of
fixed durations in guidelines.
