Background: Cannabis is increasingly available for the treat-
ment of chronic pain, yet its efficacy remains uncertain.
Purpose: To review the benefits of plant-based cannabis prep-
arations for treating chronic pain in adults and the harms of can-
nabis use in chronic pain and general adult populations.
Data Sources: MEDLINE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Re-
views, and several other sources from database inception to
March 2017.
Study Selection: Intervention trials and observational studies,
published in English, involving adults using plant-based canna-
bis preparations that reported pain, quality of life, or adverse
effect outcomes.
Data Extraction: Two investigators independently abstracted
study characteristics and assessed study quality, and the investi-
gator group graded the overall strength of evidence using stan-
dard criteria.
Data Synthesis: From 27 chronic pain trials, there is low-
strength evidence that cannabis alleviates neuropathic pain but
insufficient evidence in other pain populations. According to 11
systematic reviews and 32 primary studies, harms in general
population studies include increased risk for motor vehicle acci-
dents, psychotic symptoms, and short-term cognitive impair-
ment. Although adverse pulmonary effects were not seen in
younger populations, evidence on most other long-term physi-
cal harms, in heavy or long-term cannabis users, or in older pop-
ulations is insufficient.
Limitation: Few methodologically rigorous trials; the cannabis
formulations studied may not reflect commercially available
products; and limited applicability to older, chronically ill popu-
lations and patients who use cannabis heavily.
Conclusion: Limited evidence suggests that cannabis may alle-
viate neuropathic pain in some patients, but insufficient evidence
exists for other types of chronic pain. Among general popula-
tions, limited evidence suggests that cannabis is associated with
an increased risk for adverse mental health effects.

T
he use of medicinal cannabis has become increas-
ingly accepted in the United States and globally (1,
2). Eight states and the District of Columbia have legal-
ized cannabis for recreational purposes, and 28 states
and the District of Columbia have legalized it for med-
ical purposes (3). Between 45% and 80% of persons
who seek medical cannabis do so for pain manage-
ment (4, 5). Among patients who are prescribed long-
term opioid therapy for pain, up to 39% are also using
cannabis (6, 7). Physicians will increasingly need to en-
gage in evidence-based discussions with their patients
about the potential benefits and harms of cannabis use.
However, little comprehensive and critically appraised
information exists about the benefits and harms of us-
ing cannabis to treat chronic pain. The objectives of this
systematic review were to assess the efficacy of canna-
bis for treating chronic pain and to provide a broad
overview of the short- and long-term physical and men-
tal health effects of cannabis use in chronic pain and
general patient populations.

 cently completed studies on ClinicalTrials.gov, the In-
ternational Clinical Trials Registry Platform, the ISRCTN
Registry, National Institutes of Health RePORTER, and
the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Grants
On-Line Database. Supplement 1 (available at Annals
.org) provides details on the search strategy, which we
developed in consultation with a research librarian.
Study Selection
We included English-language studies assessing
the effect on nonpregnant adults of plant-based canna-
bis preparations or whole-plant extracts, such as nabixi-
mols, a nonsynthetic pharmaceutical product with a
standard composition and dose (oromucosal spray
delivering tetrahydrocannabinol [THC], 2.7 mg, and
cannabidiol, 2.5 mg). We did not include synthesized,
pharmaceutically
prepared
cannabinoids,
such
as
dronabinol or nabilone, because they are not available
in dispensaries, and the efficacy of synthetic cannabi-
noid preparations for chronic pain was examined in 2
recent reviews (10, 11). We broadly defined plant-
based cannabis preparations to include any prepara-
tion of the cannabis plant itself (for example, cannabis
cigarettes and oils) or cannabis plant extracts to cap-
ture the variety of products available in U.S. dispensa-
ries (12).
To address the efficacy of cannabis for treating
chronic pain, we included controlled clinical trials and
cohort studies. This review focuses specifically on pain
outcomes, although our larger report and search were
designed to include other outcomes, such as sleep and
quality of life (8). Because data about harms in the gen-
eral population might be applicable to chronic pain
populations, we examined harms broadly and reported
whether the data were derived from studies of the gen-
eral population or populations with chronic pain. To
capture potential cannabis-related harms that may be
of interest to clinicians and patients, but whose preva-
lence has not been well-characterized in larger-scale
observational studies, we also included case series and
descriptive studies of “emerging harms.” Supplement 2
(available at Annals.org) provides the criteria we used
for study selection.
We searched for primary literature and systematic
reviews; we dual-reviewed 5% of identified abstracts
and all of the included full-text articles to ensure reli-
ability. Disagreements were resolved by a third re-
viewer. Given the broad scope of this review, we sum-
marized data from existing systematic reviews. We
included only reviews that clearly reported their search
strategy, reported inclusion and exclusion criteria, and
appraised the internal validity of the included trials (13).
We prioritized the most recent reviews and those with
the broadest scope. In addition, we included individual
studies that met inclusion criteria and either were pub-
lished after the end search date of the included review
or were not included in a prior systematic review.
Data Extraction and Quality Assessment
For all reports, 2 investigators abstracted details of
study design, setting, patient population, intervention,
and follow-up, as well as important co-interventions,
health outcomes, health care use, and harms.
Two reviewers independently assessed each trial
(including those that were identified from a prior sys-
tematic review) as having low, high, or unclear risk of
bias (ROB) for the pain outcome using a tool devel-
oped by the Cochrane Collaboration (14). Disagree-
ments were resolved by consensus. To assess the ROB
of observational studies for the pain outcome, we con-
sidered potential sources of bias most relevant to this
evidence base and adapted existing assessment tools
(15, 16) (Supplement 3, available at Annals.org).

 Data Synthesis and Analysis
For the subgroup of neuropathic pain studies,
we did a study-level meta-analysis of the proportion of
patients experiencing clinically significant (≥30%) pain
relief (Supplement 4, available at Annals.org), and we
used the profile-likelihood random-effects model (17)
to combine risk ratios. We assessed the magnitude of
statistical heterogeneity among the studies using the
standard Cochran chi-square test, the I2 statistic (18).
All analyses were done using Stata/IC, version 13.1
(StataCorp). Clinical heterogeneity, variation in out-
comes reported, and the small number of trials pre-
cluded meta-analysis for other subgroups and out-
comes, so we reported these qualitatively. After group
discussion, we classified the overall strength of evi-
dence for each outcome as high, moderate, low, or in-
sufficient on the basis of the consistency, coherence,
and applicability of the body of evidence as well as the
internal validity of individual studies (19, 20).
Role of the Funding Source
The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Quality En-
hancement Research Initiative supported the review
but had no role in the design and conduct of the study;
collection, management, analysis and interpretation of
the data; preparation, review, and approval of the
manuscript; or decision to submit the manuscript for
publication.
RESULTS
After reviewing 13 674 titles and abstracts, we
included 13 systematic reviews and 62 primary studies
(Figure). Table 1 provides study-level details and the
ROB rating for each of the chronic pain trials. Table 2
summarizes findings, including the ROB rating, by pain
subgroup. Table 3 summarizes the harms in both pain
and general populations. Supplement 5 (available at
Annals.org) provides additional study-level data from
pain studies not included in prior reviews and from
studies on general harms.
Effects of Cannabis in Treating Chronic Pain
We identified 22 RCTs (21–42) from 2 recently pub-
lished systematic reviews (10, 11) and an additional 8
studies (5 RCTs [43–47] and 3 cohort studies [48–50])
that met our inclusion criteria and were not included in
prior reviews. The primary methods of continuous pain
assessment were a visual analogue scale from 0 to 100
mm and a numerical rating scale (NRS) from 0 to 10
(where 0 indicated no pain and 10 indicated the worst
possible pain). Some of the studies identified the pro-
portion of participants who had clinically significant im-
provements in pain intensity (defined as ≥30% reduc-
tion, or approximately 2 points on the NRS and 20 mm
on the visual analogue scale).
Neuropathic Pain
Thirteen trials examined the effects of cannabis-
based preparations on neuropathic pain (Table 1). Par-
ticipants had central or peripheral neuropathic pain re-
lated to various health conditions. Of these studies, 11
were rated as having low ROB (24, 27, 28, 30, 31, 33,
36, 39, 40, 43, 47), 1 as having unclear ROB (26), and 1
as having high ROB (35). Overall, we found low-
strength evidence that cannabis may alleviate neuro-
pathic pain in some patients (Table 2). Studies gener-
ally did not find clinically significant between-group
differences on continuous pain scales, but a higher
proportion of intervention patients had clinically signif-
icant pain relief up to several months later. Across 9
studies, intervention patients were more likely to report
at least 30% improvement in pain (risk ratio, 1.43 [95%
CI, 1.16 to 1.88]; I2 = 38.6%; P = 0.111) (Supplement 4).
Most studies were small, few reported outcomes be-
yond 2 to 3 weeks, and none reported long-term
outcomes.
In the largest RCT, 246 patients with peripheral
neuropathic pain self-titrated nabiximols up to a maxi-
mum dosage of 24 sprays per day or received a pla-
cebo (27). Those who completed the study (79 in the
nabiximols group and 94 in the placebo group) and
responded positively to the intervention had a signifi-
cant decrease in pain (odds ratio, 1.97 [CI, 1.05 to
3.70]). However, among all participants, including
those who did not have an intervention response, the
reduction in the NRS pain score did not reach clinical or
statistical significance. The second-largest RCT with low
ROB included 55 patients with HIV-associated sensory
neuropathy who were randomly assigned to smoke ei-
ther 3.56% THC cigarettes or a placebo 3 times per day
for 5 days. Among those who completed the study,
52% (n = 13) of the treatment group had a clinically
significant reduction in pain compared with 24% (n = 6)
of the placebo group (33).
A 1-year prospective cohort study (n = 431) of pa-
tients with nociceptive and neuropathic chronic non-
cancer pain provides information about long-term
treatment effects (50). Cannabis users had a reduction
in average pain intensity (using a visual analogue scale
from 0 to 10) that was stable across 4 time points over
1 year, but the change was small and not clinically sig-
nificant (0.92 [CI, 0.62 to 1.23]).
Multiple Sclerosis
Nine trials examined the effects of cannabis-based
preparations on pain among patients with multiple
sclerosis (MS) (Table 1). Participants generally had in-
tractable body pain or neuropathic pain related to a
clinically confirmed diagnosis of MS. Three of these tri-
als were rated as having low ROB (29, 42, 44), 5 as
having unclear ROB (22, 37, 38, 41, 45), and 1 as having
high ROB (32). Overall, we found insufficient evidence
to characterize the effects of cannabis on pain in pa-
tients with MS (Table 2) because of the small number of
methodologically rigorous studies, inconsistent find-
ings across studies, lack of long-term outcomes, and
small number of patients included in the trials.
Of the 3 low-ROB trials, 1 found small but clinically
nonsignificant alleviation of pain at 5 weeks, 1 found

cause of pain was unspecified. Two studies were rated
as having unclear ROB (23, 25), and 1 study was rated
as having high ROB (34). Overall, these trials provide
insufficient evidence because of the small number of
studies and their methodological limitations, including
high attrition, exclusion of patients with variable pain

 scores, use of some nonvalidated measures, and lack of
clarity about randomization and blinding procedures
(Table 2).
Other or Mixed Pain Conditions
Two trials (21, 46) and 3 cohort studies (48–50) ex-
amined the effects of cannabis-based preparations on
pain among patients with other or mixed pain condi-
tions, including fibromyalgia, rheumatoid arthritis, and
inflammatory abdominal pain (Table 1). One trial was
rated as having unclear ROB (21), and 1 was rated as
having high ROB (46). One observational study was
rated as having low ROB (50), and the other 2 were at
high ROB (48, 49). Overall, evidence was insufficient
because of the inconsistent results and the paucity of
methodologically rigorous studies (Table 2). Limitations
of individual studies include lack of follow-up, inade-
quate allocation concealment, selection bias, high attri-
tion, and lack of inclusion of nonnaive cannabis users.
Harms of Cannabis Use
General Adverse Events Among Patients With
Chronic Pain
Data from 2 systematic reviews examining cannabis
for chronic pain suggest that cannabis use may be as-
sociated with a higher risk for short-term adverse ef-
fects (10, 11). However, the rates of adverse events did
not significantly differ between groups in the additional
pain trials we reviewed. Although most reported ad-
verse events were mild, such as dizziness and light-
headedness, some were serious, such as suicide at-
tempts, paranoia, and agitation (Table 3). An additional
prospective observational study did not detect a differ-
ence in serious adverse events between a cannabis
group (12.5% ± 1.5% THC, 2.5 g/d) and control group
(adjusted incidence rate ratio for event, 1.08 [CI, 0.57 to
2.04]) (50).
Medical Harms in the General Population
Moderate-strength evidence from 2 well-designed
cohort studies (52, 53) suggests that low levels of can-
nabis smoking do not adversely affect lung function
over about 20 years in young adults, but some evi-
dence suggests that daily use may cause adverse pul-
monary effects over an extended period (Table 3). Be-
cause of methodological limitations, including a lack of
longitudinal exposure measurement and potential re-
call bias, 2 studies (55, 56) give insufficient evidence
about the effect of cannabis use on the risk for cardio-
vascular events. A meta-analysis (59) of 9 case–control
studies provides low-strength evidence that cannabis
use is not associated with an increased risk for head
and neck cancer (odds ratio, 1.02 [CI, 0.91 to 1.14]).
Another meta-analysis (57) of 6 case–control studies
provides low-strength evidence of no elevated risk for
lung cancer with cannabis use (odds ratio, 0.96 [CI,
0.66 to 1.38]). Insufficient evidence exists about the ef-
fects of cannabis on testicular (60) or transitional cell
cancer (61) (Table 3).
Mental Health and Cognitive Harms in the
General Population
One systematic review (64) and 8 studies (65–71,
74) consistently found an association between cannabis
use (specifically related to THC content) and the devel-
opment of psychotic symptoms (low strength of evi-
dence) (Table 3). The association was seen both in pop-
ulations at risk for psychotic spectrum disorders and in
average-risk populations. The possibility that cannabis
contributes directly to the development of psychotic
symptoms is supported but not proved by biological
plausibility, evidence of a dose–response relationship,
prospective cohort studies, and small experimental
studies.
A systematic review of 6 longitudinal studies pro-
vides low-strength evidence of an association between
cannabis use and exacerbation of manic symptoms in
patients with known bipolar disorder. The review found
higher incidence of new-onset mania symptoms among
populations without a diagnosis of bipolar disorder
(pooled odds ratio, 2.97 [CI, 1.80 to 4.90]) (63).
Two systematic reviews of studies in general pop-
ulations provide moderate-strength evidence that ac-
tive, long-term cannabis use is associated with small to
moderate negative effects on many domains of cogni-
tive function, but evidence on cognitive effects in past
users is insufficient (72, 73).
A meta-analysis of 4 epidemiologic studies found
significantly increased odds of suicide death (pooled
odds ratio, 2.56 [CI, 1.25 to 5.27]) with any cannabis
use. However, our confidence in the findings is limited
by inconsistent findings among included studies, inad-
equate assessment of exposure, and inadequate ad-
justment for confounding among the studies (insuffi-
cient strength of evidence) (62, 64).
Motor Vehicle Accidents in the General Population
Moderate-strength evidence from a recent meta-
analysis of 21 multinational observational studies sug-
gests that acute cannabis intoxication is associated with
a moderate increase in collision risk (odds ratio, 1.35
[CI, 1.15 to 1.61]) (51).
Other Harms in the General Population
Long-term cannabis use has been associated with a
severe form of cyclic vomiting called cannabinoid hy-
peremesis syndrome (75–82). Serious infectious dis-
eases, including aspergillosis (83–86) and tuberculosis,
have also been associated with smoking cannabis (87,
88). Evidence of the effects of cannabis on violent be-
havior is mixed (89, 90). Cannabis use was associated
with incident cannabis use disorder (adjusted odds ra-
tio, 9.5 [CI, 6.4 to 14.1]) in a large (N = 34 653) prospec-
tive cohort study (91). In a cross-sectional study of
patients receiving daily opioid therapy for chronic pain,
the prevalence of cannabis use disorder was 2.4%, and
13.2% reported having used cannabis in the past 30
days. The prevalence of cannabis use disorder among
the subgroup of current users, however, was not re-
ported (92).

 DISCUSSION
In our systematic review, we found limited evi-
dence on the potential benefits and harms of cannabis
use in chronic pain populations (Tables 2 and 3). We
found low-strength evidence that cannabis prepara-
tions with precisely defined THC–cannabidiol content
(most in a 1:1 to 2:1 ratio) may alleviate neuropathic
pain but insufficient evidence in populations with other
types of pain. Most studies are small, many have meth-
odological flaws, and the long-term effects are unclear
given the brief follow-up of most studies.
Among neuropathic pain studies, we found a dis-
crepancy between continuous and dichotomous pain
outcomes. Possible interpretations are that cannabis is
simply not consistently effective or that, although can-
nabis may not have clinically important effects on aver-
age, subgroups of patients may experience large ef-
fects. We did not find data to clarify which subgroups of
patients are more or less likely to benefit.
Our findings complement several recent reviews. In
1 review, the authors concluded that low- to moderate-
strength evidence supports the efficacy of cannabis in
chronic pain populations, limited mainly to those with
MS or neuropathic pain. However, a separate group
reviewed and reanalyzed a similar set of published ar-
ticles and determined that insufficient to low-strength
evidence supports the use of cannabis to treat chronic
noncancer pain (11). A recent report from the National
Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine ex-
amined the biological and clinical effects of cannabis
across a broad range of indications and concluded that
there is substantial evidence of benefit for patients with

 chronic pain. Although the overall conclusions seem to
differ from our findings, the authors stipulated that the
clinical improvements were modest and limited to neu-
ropathic pain (93), and they underscored the urgent
need for better research clarifying the effects of canna-
bis. Our review augments this report by using a system-
atic approach on a more focused topic (chronic pain
and harms) as well as standard terminology for describ-
ing the strength of the body of evidence (19).
Even though we did not find strong, consistent ev-
idence of benefit, clinicians will still need to engage in
evidence-based discussions with patients managing
chronic pain who are using or requesting to use can-
nabis. Therefore, clinicians must understand what is
known and unknown about its potential harms.
We found moderate-strength evidence that light to
moderate cannabis smoking does not adversely affect
lung function over about 20 years. However, the limited
data on the effects of heavy use suggest a possible
deleterious effect on lung function over time (52, 53).
We found low-strength evidence that light to moderate
cannabis use is not associated with lung cancer or head
and neck cancer diagnoses independent of tobacco
use, but the data are limited to case–control studies
and do not address heavy use. We found insufficient
evidence examining whether cannabis use is associ-
ated with cardiovascular events over the long term.
Cannabis use has potentially serious mental health
and adverse cognitive effects, although data are insuf-
ficient to characterize the magnitude of risk or in whom
the risk is highest. Cannabis seems to be associated
with at least small, short-term deleterious effects on
cognition in active users, but long-term effects in past
users are uncertain. We found a consistent association
between cannabis use and the development of psy-
chotic symptoms over the short and long term. A large
prospective cohort study in the United States found
that cannabis use was associated with a substantial risk
for incident cannabis use disorder and a smaller risk for
incident alcohol and other substance use disorders
(91). Finally, we found some adverse effects that seem
to be related to cannabis use and are important for
clinicians to know (for example, infectious disease com-
plications, cannabis hyperemesis syndrome, and vio-
lent behavior), but the incidence of these effects has
not been well-characterized.
Evidence-based nonpharmacologic and nonopioid
pharmacologic therapies are the preferred initial meth-
ods for treating chronic pain (94). Clinicians may strug-
gle with treating chronic pain in patients who have not
responded to first-line treatment, and cannabis may be
perceived as a safer strategy in these patients (95). The
scale and severity of adverse events, including death,
seen with opioids have not been described with canna-
bis in the literature (although less research is available
on cannabis than on opioids) (95). However, no studies
have directly compared cannabis with opioids, and no
good-quality data exist on how cannabis use affects
opioid use and opioid-related adverse effects. Cross-
sectional studies suggest an association between co-
occurring cannabis use and adverse opioid-related
events (that is, misuse or more refills) among patients
prescribed opioids (6, 7, 96–98). By contrast, an open-
label study found that pain scores and opioid use de-
creased over 6 months in participants with chronic pain
who initiated cannabis treatment, although confidence
in the findings is limited by the large number of partic-
ipants lost to follow-up (99).
The applicability of study data to current practice is
limited in several ways. The patient populations in
many studies were highly selected, and some studies
included a run-in period after which patients who did
not respond were excluded from further study. The
data on effectiveness largely come from trials examin-
ing formulations with precisely defined THC and canna-
bidiol content, which differs from the reality of clinical
practice. Even though dispensaries are increasingly la-
beling products'content, discrepancies often exist be-
tween labeled and measured content (100). Moreover,
the dose of THC assessed in many of the studies is
substantially lower than that in products commonly
available in dispensaries (for example, 2.5 mg of THC
vs. a range of 15 to 200 mg) (100).
Finally, the evidence base on harms is limited be-
cause studies include relatively few patients who are
older, are chronically ill, or have a history of heavy and
prolonged cannabis use. In observational studies, the
exact dose of exposure to cannabis was rarely known
because of recall bias, and the potency (that is, in esti-
mates of cannabis cigarettes smoked per day) was im-
possible to assess. On the other hand, this imprecision
probably mirrors the uncertainty clinicians will face in
discussing benefits and harms with their patients.
Our approach to synthesizing the literature also has
limitations. Given the broad scope of our review, we
relied on existing systematic reviews to identify the best
available evidence. However, we also comprehensively
searched for and included newer primary studies, in-
cluded only good-quality systematic reviews, and reas-
sessed the quality of primary pain studies included in
prior reviews. We excluded studies of synthetic pre-
scription cannabinoids, in part because these were in-
cluded in recent reviews and are not available in can-
nabis
dispensaries.
Regardless,
inclusion
of
these
studies would not have changed our overall findings
because so few studies were available, they were meth-
odologically flawed, and they had very small sample
sizes. We examined harms in both chronic pain and
general populations, although the degree to which
harms data in general populations apply to patients
with chronic pain is uncertain. Finally, we focused spe-
cifically on pain outcomes in patients with chronic pain,
but we acknowledge that other outcomes are also im-
portant in the treatment of chronic pain. In our larger
report, we describe low-strength evidence that canna-
bis may reduce spasticity and improve sleep in patients
with MS. We found insufficient evidence regarding the
effects of cannabis on these outcomes in other patient
populations and regarding effects on quality of life and
functional status in any population (8).
Virtually no conclusive information exists about the
benefits of cannabis in chronic pain populations, and

 limited information is available on harms, so method-
ologically strong research in almost any area is likely to
add to the strength of evidence (see Table 8 of Supple-
ment 5 for a list of important research gaps and Table 9
of Supplement 5 for a list of ongoing studies). Of note,
many of the studies we found were done in European
countries, suggesting that there may be fewer barriers
to conducting cannabis-related research there than in
the United States, where barriers are substantial.
Although cannabis is increasingly available for
medical and recreational use, little methodologically
rigorous evidence examines its effects in patients with
chronic pain. Limited evidence suggests that it may al-
leviate neuropathic pain, but evidence in other pain
