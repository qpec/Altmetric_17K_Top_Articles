Abstract
Identifying biological mechanisms through which the experience of adversity emerges as 
individual risk for mental illness is an important step towards developing strategies for 
personalized treatment and, ultimately, prevention. Preclinical studies have identified epigenetic 
modification of gene expression as one such mechanism. Recent clinical studies have suggested 
that epigenetic modification, particularly methylation of gene regulatory regions, also acts to shape 
human brain function associated with risk for mental illness. However, it is not yet clear if 
differential gene methylation as a function of adversity contributes to the emergence of individual 
risk for mental illness. Using prospective longitudinal epigenetic, neuroimaging, and behavioral 
data from 132 adolescents, we demonstrate that changes in gene methylation associated with lower 
socioeconomic status predict changes in risk-related brain function. Specifically, we find that 
lower socioeconomic status during adolescence is associated with an increase in methylation of 
the proximal promoter of the serotonin transporter gene, which predicts greater increases in threat-
related amygdala reactivity. We subsequently demonstrate that greater increases in amygdala 
reactivity moderate the association between a positive family history for depression and the later 
manifestation of depressive symptoms. These initial results suggest a specific biological 
mechanism through which adversity contributes to altered brain function, which in turn moderates 
the emergence of general liability as individual risk for mental illness. If replicated, this 
prospective pathway may represent a novel target biomarker for intervention and prevention 
amongst high-risk individuals.

 Introduction
While specific stressors including exposure to traumatic events or the experience of 
childhood maltreatment and neglect have been associated with increased risk for mental 
illness,1 non-specific, relatively common risk factors, such as low socioeconomic status, 
account for a large proportion of psychiatric morbidity in the population.2 Low 
socioeconomic status may confer risk through a variety of mechanisms, including higher 
levels of perceived and objective stress and cumulative environmental risk such as poor 
housing quality, noise pollution, and exposure to violence.3 Lower socioeconomic status 
(SES) has been associated with a host of negative outcomes including poorer general health 
and increased risk for mental illness including depression, anxiety, and addiction.2,4,5 Given 
the insidious nature of low SES, it is at best difficult to directly mitigate these associated 
risks. An alternative strategy is to identify specific biological processes mediating the 
association between lower SES and individual risk thereby creating possible targets through 
which risk may be buffered.
One candidate biological process through which the environment may be exerting its 
influence is epigenetics, which encompasses molecular mechanisms mediating the effects of 
extrinsic factors on intrinsic functions through the modulation of gene expression.6 In 
particular, experience-dependent methylation of gene regulatory regions such as proximal 
promoter sites has been proposed as one epigenetic mechanism through which stress may 
drive risk for future mental illness.6 Generally, relatively increased DNA methylation of 
gene promoters, which is most often associated with decreased gene expression, has been 
associated with exposure to both specific7 and non-specific stressors including lower SES.8 
These epigenetic changes in gene expression subsequently impact risk-related brain function 
and behavior.9
Recent clinical studies have specifically implicated DNA methylation of the proximal 
promoter region of the serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4) as a potential epigenetic 
mechanism of increased risk for mental illness. For example, the experience of specific (i.e., 
child abuse)10 and non-specific (i.e., lower SES)11 stressors is associated with increased 
methylation of multiple CpG sites within SLC6A4, including the proximal promoter, and 
these patterns of methylation have been associated with higher depressive symptoms.12 
Moreover, we have demonstrated that relatively increased SLC6A4 proximal promoter 
methylation is associated with increased threat-related amygdala reactivity, which not only 
plays a central role in stress responsiveness but also is implicated in the etiology and 
pathophysiology of stress-related disorders including depression.13,14 Collectively these 
epigenetic findings are consistent with the important modulatory role of the serotonin 
transporter on stress physiology, amygdala function, and mood.15
Despite these findings, cross-sectional data collected at one point in time do not allow for 
examination of dynamic changes in DNA methylation. Thus, it is unclear if the experience 
of stress is associated with a change in SLC6A4 methylation and, if so, how this manifests 
as a change in risk-related brain function. Here we use longitudinal epigenetic, 
neuroimaging, and behavioral data to construct a prospective indirect effects model 
examining whether lower socioeconomic status predicts increased future risk for depression

 via increased SLC6A4 proximal promoter methylation and resulting sensitization of threat-
related amygdala reactivity. We test this model in adolescents at high and low risk for 
depression due to presence or absence of a family history of depression, respectively.
In prior analyses of this cohort, we have found that either a positive family history of 
depression or exposure to stressful life events predict greater increases in the reactivity of the 
left amygdala to fearful facial expressions from Wave 1 to Wave 2.16 Thus, we first 
examined if adversity-related changes in SLC6A4 proximal promoter methylation may, in 
part, explain this sensitization of amygdala reactivity. We modeled the effect of three types 
of stressors previously associated with risk for depression, including childhood 
maltreatment, stressful life events, and low socioeconomic status, on changes in methylation. 
We hypothesized that exposure to these stressors would be associated with an increase in 
SLC6A4 proximal promoter methylation from Wave 1 to Wave 2, and that this increase 
would be associated with sensitized amygdala reactivity to threat over the same time period.
Although a positive family history is one of the strongest predictors of the future 
development of depression, not all individuals with this risk factor will become 
depressed.17,18 Thus, we next examined the extent to which greater increases in threat-
related amygdala reactivity associated with differential SLC6A4 methylation predicted 
individual risk for depression in adolescents and whether this risk was specific for youth 
with a positive family history of depression. Prior studies have found that threat-related 
amygdala reactivity predicts greater psychological vulnerability to future trauma,19,20 and 
we recently demonstrated in a large sample of young adults that a baseline measure of 
threat-related amygdala reactivity predicts the likelihood of experiencing anxiety and 
depression symptoms following subsequent exposure to stressful life events several years 
later.14 Accordingly, we hypothesized that increases in amygdala reactivity from Wave 1 to 
Wave 2 would predict greater increases in depressive symptoms from Wave 2 to Wave 3, 
approximately one year later.
Materials and Methods
Participants
In line with our prior work,13 analyses focused on the subset of 183 Caucasian, non-
Hispanic participants from the Teen Alcohol Outcomes Study (TAOS)16 in order to avoid 
potential population stratification due to differences in ancestry (see Supplementary Table 1 
for full sample demographics). We used genetic ancestry21 to confirm self-report of race/
ethnicity (see Supplemental Methods).
Participants were 11 to 15 years old at Wave 1, 13 to 18 years old at Wave 2, and 14 to 19 
years old at Wave 3. After complete description of the study to the participants, parents 
provided written informed consent and participants provided assent following procedures 
approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of Texas Health Sciences 
Center San Antonio. Twenty participants (19 positive for a family history of depression [FH
+] and 1 negative for a family history [FHâˆ’]) had an anxiety disorder diagnosis at study 
entry or developed an anxiety disorder between Waves 1 and 2. Anxiety diagnosis (dummy-
coded) was included as a covariate in analyses run in the full sample, but removed as a

 covariate in multi-group analyses given the single diagnosis in the FHâˆ’ group. Seven FH+ 
participants developed a diagnosis of major depression between Waves 1 and 2 and 2 FH+ 
participants developed a diagnosis between Waves 2 and 3. We did not include depression 
diagnosis as a covariate since depressive symptoms at Wave 2 were included as a covariate 
in all analyses. There were 21 pairs of siblings included in this sample. Recruitment 
procedures, attrition, and exclusion of participants for fMRI quality control at Waves 1 and 2 
have been reported previously.16 We also examined characteristics of attrition from Wave 1 
to 3. Fewer FH+ participants (n=33) completed the Wave 3 follow-up compared to FHâˆ’ 
participants (n=46), Ï‡2(1)=5.12, p=.024. There were no differences in attrition based on 
gender, age, CTQ emotional neglect scores, stressful life events, SES, or depressive 
symptoms assessed at Wave 1.
Environmental risk factors
Consistent with our prior research,22 emotional neglect was assessed at Wave 1 with the 
emotional neglect subscale of the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire.23 To assess SES at 
Wave 1, parents reported education levels and income for themselves and their spouses (if 
married). Consistent with prior research,24 a composite SES indicator was calculated by 
averaging the standardized values of these variables (Supplementary Table 2). Stressful life 
events occurring the year prior to the first fMRI scan were assessed at Wave 1 with the 
Stressful Life Events Schedule.25 As reported in our prior research,16 objective threat ratings 
for each life event were squared, summed, and averaged to obtain a mean level of 
objectively-rated stressful life events occurring the year prior to the first wave.
SLC6A4 methylation
Details regarding acquisition and analysis of SLC6A4 methylation have been reported 
previously for the first wave of the study.13 Procedures were identical for obtaining 
methylation levels at the second wave of the study. In line with prior research,13 data from 
the 20 CpG sites proximal to the transcription start site of SLC6A4 measured at Wave 1 and 
Wave 2 were entered into a principal components analysis. Consistent with our prior 
research conducted with Wave 1 data,13 the principal component analysis including Wave 1 
and Wave 2 data resulted in 5 components with eigenvalues greater than 1, and scores for the 
first component (representing 24.1% of the total variance) were extracted for each individual 
(Supplementary Table 3). Similar to our prior work in this sample,16 residualized change 
scores were calculated to assess changes greater or less than expected at Wave 2 based on 
Wave 1 values. Methylation data were available for 178 participants at Wave 1 and 136 
participants at Wave 2; residualized change scores (i.e., for those participants that provided 
valid data at both Wave 1 and Wave 2) were available in 132 participants.
Amygdala reactivity
Details regarding acquisition, pre-processing, and analysis of fMRI data have been reported 
previously.16 All analyses were conducted with mean parameter estimates extracted from 
functional clusters significant at p<.05 family-wise error corrected within amygdala regions 
of interest. We focused analyses on values extracted from the left amygdala for the contrast 
of Fearful Faces > Shapes, based on our prior finding that left amygdala reactivity to fearful 
faces increased from Wave 1 to Wave 2 in adolescents at higher risk for depression.16 In

 order to examine specificity of effects to the basolateral or centromedial amygdala, we also 
extracted values for the contrast of Fearful Faces > Shapes using probabilistic regions of 
interest based on cytoarchitectonic mapping26 and corrected for multiple comparisons by 
applying a Bonferroni-corrected threshold of p<.025. Similar to the procedure with SLC6A4 
methylation, we calculated a residualized change score. Imaging data were available for 139 
participants at Wave 1 and 107 participants at Wave 2; change scores were available in 87 
participants.
Depressive symptoms
Adolescents completed the Youth Self Report27 at each wave of the study. To assess 
depressive symptoms, we used Affective Problems scores from the DSM-oriented scales,28 
which have been shown to correspond to DSM-IV major depressive disorder symptoms.29 
Residualized change scores were calculated to assess changes in symptoms from Wave 2 to 
3. Symptom scores were available in 136 participants at Wave 2 and 79 participants at Wave 
3; residualized change scores were available in 79 participants.
Covariates
We included the following as covariates on all paths of the model: age at Wave 1, time (in 
years) between waves, gender (dummy-coded: 0 = Male, 1 = Female), anxiety diagnosis 
(except in multi-group models), and the risk factors (CTQ emotional neglect, SES, and 
stressful life events at Wave 1). Note that the risk factors were predictors of interest in the 
first path and that they were then carried forward as covariates on all other paths of the 
model. Family history (dummy-coded: 0 = negative family history, 1 = positive family 
history) was also included as a covariate in analyses conducted in the full sample; this was 
removed as a covariate when conducting multi-group analyses to test for moderation by 
family history. As described in detail elsewhere,13 a subset of participants (n=103) were 
genotyped for the serotonin transporter-linked polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR) and 
rs25531. Genotype (dummy-coded: 0 = LALA; 1 = LA/S, LA/LG, S/S, LG/LG, S/LG) was 
included as a covariate on all paths. Genotype distribution did not deviate from Hardy-
Weinberg equilibrium for the 5-HTTLPR, Ï‡2(1)=.001, p=.97, or rs25531, Ï‡2(1)=.44, p=.51, 
genotypes. Finally, to ensure that changes in methylation and amygdala reactivity between 
Wave 1 and Wave 2 emerged prior to the onset of depressive symptoms, we also included 
YSR Affective Problems scores at Wave 2 as a covariate in all analyses. The one exception 
was in the final path (predicting residualized change in Affective Problems scores from 
Wave 2 to 3) because YSR Affective Symptoms at Wave 2 are implicitly controlled for using 
residualized change as an outcome. We also examined gender as a moderator of all paths of 
the analysis (reported in Supplemental Information).
Statistical Analyses
All statistical analyses were conducted using MPlus v7 software with full information 
maximum likelihood estimation, which provides unbiased estimates in the presence of 
missing data. Each path was first estimated in the full sample including all covariates 
described above. All predictors were mean centered to aid in interpretation of the results and 
the variance and covariance of all predictors was modeled. Next, multi-group analyses were 
conducted to test for moderation by family history. Moderation was assessed using Ï‡2

 difference tests; if constraining parameter estimates to be equal between groups leads to a 
significant decrease in model fit, then one can conclude the effect is significantly moderated 
by family history. Additional tests to examine the robustness of these effects are reported in 
the Supplemental Information.
After testing each path individually, we then constructed an indirect effects model to test the 
indirect effect of environmental risk factors on changes in depressive symptoms, mediated 
by changes in SLC6A4 methylation and amygdala reactivity to fear. Based on results from 
testing paths individually, we constrained the paths from environmental risk to SLC6A4 
methylation and from SLC6A4 methylation to amygdala reactivity to be equal across family 
history groups, but allowed the final path (change in amygdala reactivity to change in 
symptoms) to be free across the positive family history and negative family history groups 
given evidence for moderation. We also freed each parameter in the model individually and 
tested whether allowing parameter estimates for any of the covariates or variances to vary by 
family history improved the fit of the model. None of the covariates were significantly 
moderated by family history; therefore, all parameters except that path were constrained to 
be equal in the model. The 5-HTTLPR genotype covariate was removed from this model due 
to poor model fit; removing this covariate from each path resulted in a significant 
improvement in model fit, Î”Ï‡2(4)=50.22, p<.001. To provide a measure of general effect 
size for the indirect effect, we report the product of coefficients Î±Î² statistic. We also provide 
bootstrapped confidence intervals, which use a Monte Carlo simulation (1,000 draws), 
which do not assume normality of the distribution of indirect effects to assess significance.
Results
Lower socioeconomic status at Wave 1 predicts greater increases in SLC6A4 proximal 
promoter methylation at Wave 2
We first tested whether stressors previously associated with risk for depression predicted 
changes in SLC6A4 methylation. Consistent with our hypothesis, lower socioeconomic 
status measured at Wave 1 prospectively predicted greater increases in SLC6A4 proximal 
promoter methylation two years later at Wave 2, B=âˆ’.33, SE=.1, Beta=âˆ’.24, p=.02, Î”r2=.05 
(Figure 1). In fact, SES was the only measure of environmental stress that predicted changes 
in SLC6A4 proximal promoter methylation (Supplementary Table 4). Although SES 
significantly varied as a function of familial risk in the expected direction (i.e., lower in 
those with a positive family history), the effect of SES on SLC6A4 methylation was not 
moderated by family history for depression, Î”Ï‡2(1)<.001, p>.99. In other words, lower SES 
predicted an increase in SLC6A4 proximal methylation over time to the same degree in 
adolescents with or without a positive family history of mental illness.
Increases in SLC6A4 proximal promoter methylation from Wave 1 to Wave 2 predict greater 
increases in threat-related amygdala reactivity over the same time period
Having identified that lower SES is associated with an increase in SLC6A4 proximal 
promoter methylation over time, we next asked if this change in methylation was associated 
with the change in left amygdala reactivity to fearful facial expressions previously noted in 
this cohort.16 We found that greater increases in SLC6A4 proximal promoter methylation

 from Wave 1 to Wave 2 were associated with greater increases in reactivity during the same 
time window, B=.09, SE=.04, Beta=.21, p=.04, Î”r2=.05. Subsequent analysis by amygdala 
sub-region revealed this effect was driven by increases in centromedial but not basolateral 
amygdala reactivity, B=.10, SE=.04, Beta=.26, p=.01, Î”r2=.08 (Figure 2; Supplementary 
Table 5). As observed for SES effects on methylation, the association between SLC6A4 
methylation and reactivity was not moderated by familial risk, Î”Ï‡2(1)=1.02, p=.31. Thus, 
increases in SLC6A4 proximal promoter methylation predict increases in threat-related 
centromedial amygdala reactivity independently of family history of depression.
Increases in threat-related amygdala reactivity from Wave 1 to Wave 2 predict future 
increases in depressive symptoms from Wave 2 to Wave 3 one year later
Analyses revealed a significant moderating effect of familial risk on the association between 
increases in amygdala reactivity and future depressive symptoms, Î”Ï‡2(1)=5.92, p=.01. In 
adolescents with a positive family history, greater increases in reactivity from Wave 1 to 
Wave 2 prospectively predicted greater increases in depressive symptoms from Wave 2 to 
Wave 3, B=2.71, SE=1.1, Beta=.46, p=.02, Î”r2=.21 (Figure 3; Supplementary Table 6). 
There was no such relationship in adolescents without a family history of depression, B=âˆ’.
95, SE=1.3, Beta=âˆ’.17, p=.47, Î”r2=.02.
Lower socioeconomic status in adolescence has an indirect effect on future changes in 
depressive symptoms mediated by increased methylation and threat-related amygdala 
reactivity
The above analyses separately established effects between lower SES and increases in 
SLC6A4 proximal promoter methylation, increases in methylation and increases in 
amygdala reactivity, and increases in reactivity and future depressive symptoms. Lastly, we 
constructed a moderated mediation model to simultaneously examine the indirect effect of 
lower SES measured at Wave 1 on changes in depressive symptoms from Wave 2 to Wave 3, 
mediated by changes in SLC6A4 methylation and threat-related amygdala reactivity. The 
path from amygdala reactivity to changes in symptoms was freed to vary between the family 
history groups given the finding of significant moderation. All other paths were constrained 
to be equal across groups. The indirect effect was estimated by generating bias-corrected 
95% confidence intervals with 1,000 bootstrapped samples; confidence intervals that do not 
include 0 indicate a significant indirect effect. The final model had a good fit, 
Î”Ï‡2(38)=28.87, p=.86, RMSEA=.00, CFI=1.00, SRMR=.07. As expected, SES had an 
indirect effect on changes in depressive symptoms in the positive family history group only, 
Î±Î²=âˆ’.06, SE=.05, 95% confidence intervals [âˆ’.21, âˆ’.002] (Figure 4). This negative indirect 
effect indicates that lower SES predicts greater than expected increases in SLC6A4 
methylation and centromedial amygdala reactivity, which in turn predicts greater than 
expected increases in future depressive symptoms. In contrast, this indirect effect was not 
significant for the negative family history group, Î±Î²=.03, SE=.05, 95% confidence intervals 
[âˆ’.02, .17].

 Discussion
Our results provide initial evidence for a prospective biological pathway through which a 
common stressor, namely lower socioeconomic status, may increase risk for future 
depression in high-risk adolescents. Specifically, lower SES predicted residualized change in 
SLC6A4 proximal promoter methylation, which in turn predicted residualized change in 
threat-related reactivity of the centromedial amygdala, which drives a number of autonomic 
responses to stress including activation of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis. These 
findings extend our earlier observation identifying a cross-sectional relationship between 
methylation and amygdala reactivity in two separate cohorts13 and suggest that relative 
methylation status of the SLC6A4 proximal promoter region is a reliable predictor of 
amygdala reactivity across time. Because socioeconomic status was on average lower 
amongst adolescents with a positive family history of depression, and this pathway is 
uniquely associated with the emergence of depressive symptoms in these adolescents, this 
may partially explain our prior finding that these same adolescents show greater increases in 
amygdala reactivity over time.16
Our results further demonstrate that an increase in risk-related brain function prospectively 
predicts an increase in depression symptoms approximately one year later particularly 
among high-risk adolescents. Notably, we found that sensitized amygdala reactivity only 
predicted increases in depressive symptoms amongst adolescents with a positive family 
history of depression. It is possible that these high-risk adolescents experience additional 
forms of chronic adversity such as parental neglect or familial discord uncommon amongst 
their low-risk counterparts, and that this additional exposure is necessary to trigger 
symptoms of depression. This is consistent with our finding in an independent sample of 
young adults that increased amygdala reactivity to threat only predicts future internalizing 
symptoms in response to higher levels of stress.14
As our follow-up measure of depressive symptoms was limited to self-report, however, it is 
unclear if this pathway predicts clinically significant levels of dysfunction. Of course, we did 
not have access to brain-derived DNA and were limited to assays of SLC6A4 methylation in 
DNA derived from peripheral tissues. But, there is evidence that methylation of SLC6A4 
may be conserved across DNA derived from multiple tissue types including blood, saliva, 
and brain.13 These limitations notwithstanding, our results identify a specific biological 
pathway through which broader environmental adversity may act to drive individual 
vulnerability for depression amongst at-risk adolescents.
In addition to increased chronic stress experienced by parents and their offspring, lower SES 
is further associated with a range of environmental risk factors that may bias developmental 
changes in DNA methylation, including poor nutrition and smoking.30,31 Identifying specific 
environmental mechanisms contributing to the effects of SES on methylation observed here 
will help narrow targets for possible intervention. Moreover, preventive interventions such as 
training in mindfulness-based techniques may be effective in lowering threat-related 
amygdala reactivity in adolescents identified as high-risk due to increased SLC6A4 
methylation.32 Isolation of family process factors (e.g., high family conflict) that help 
explain why higher amygdala reactivity predicts depressive symptoms only in FH+

 adolescents will help further focus on targets for prevention within a family context. Thus, if 
replicated, the risk pathway identified here could represent a discrete biomarker that could 
be targeted by novel strategies for personalized treatment and prevention.

 Figure 1. Lower socioeconomic status at Wave 1 predicts greater increases in SLC6A4 
methylation from Wave 1 to 2
Standardized household SES was calculated by obtaining the mean of standardized scores of 
parents' education and income levels, as well as spouses' education and income levels if 
reporting parent was married. Lower SES at Wave 1 was associated with greater increases in 
methylation at Wave 2, B=âˆ’.33, Beta=âˆ’.24, SE=.1, p=.02, Î”r2=.05. Shaded area represents 
95% confidence intervals.

 Figure 2. Greater increases in SLC6A4 methylation are associated with greater increases in 
centromedial amygdala reactivity to fearful facial expressions from Wave 1 to Wave 2
Mean parameter estimates were extracted from functional clusters activated at both Wave 1 
and 2 within the whole left amygdala (A), the left centromedial amygdala (B), and the left 
basolateral amygdala (C) for the contrast of Fearful Faces > Shapes. Greater increases in 
SLC6A4 methylation were associated with greater increases in centromedial amygdala 
reactivity, B=.10, Beta=.26, SE=.04, p=.01, Î”r2=.08.

 Figure 3. Greater increases in centromedial amygdala reactivity to fearful faces from Wave 1 to 
Wave 2 predict greater increases in depressive symptoms from Wave 2 to Wave 3 in adolescents 
with a positive family history of depression
Residualized change scores were calculated with symptoms from the Youth Self Report 
(YSR) Affective Problems scale at Wave 2 and 3. Greater increases in centromedial 
amygdala reactivity predicted greater increases in symptoms one year later in the positive 
family history group, B=2.71, SE=1.1, Beta=.46, p=.02, Î”r2=.21.

 Figure 4. Moderated mediation model examining indirect effect of SES on future changes in 
depressive symptoms, mediated by changes in SLC6A4 methylation and centromedial amygdala 
reactivity to fear
Not shown in figure: covariates included on each path were age, gender, emotional neglect, 
stressful life events, SES, time between waves, and depressive symptoms at Wave 2 (except 
on the final path). 95% confidence intervals for the indirect effect were obtained by 
requesting 1,000 bootstrapped samples using Mplus v7. SES=socioeconomic status assessed 
at Wave 1; FH+=positive family history; FHâˆ’=negative family history.
