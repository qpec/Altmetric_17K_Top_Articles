Abstract Inflammation-induced release of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) changes breathing patterns
and the response to CO2 levels. This may have fatal consequences in newborn babies and result in
sudden infant death. To elucidate the underlying mechanisms, we present a novel breathing
brainstem organotypic culture that generates rhythmic neural network and motor activity for 3
weeks. We show that increased CO2 elicits a gap junction-dependent release of PGE2. This alters
neural network activity in the preBo
¨ tzinger rhythm-generating complex and in the chemosensitive
brainstem respiratory regions, thereby increasing sigh frequency and the depth of inspiration. We
used mice lacking eicosanoid prostanoid 3 receptors (EP3R), breathing brainstem organotypic slices
and optogenetic inhibition of EP3R+/+ cells to demonstrate that the EP3R is important for the
ventilatory response to hypercapnia. Our study identifies a novel pathway linking the inflammatory
and respiratory systems, with implications for inspiration and sighs throughout life, and the ability
to autoresuscitate when breathing fails.

Introduction
Breathing is essential for life, but the underlying mechanisms that control breathing movements and
neuronal pattern generation are under debate (Jasinski et al., 2013). Breathing maintains tissue
homeostasis, and an adequate response to increased carbon dioxide (CO2) levels is crucial
(Kaila and Ransom, 1998; Guyenet and Bayliss, 2015). Failure to adequately respond to pCO2
alterations is linked to breathing disturbances; apnea of prematurity; centrally mediated sickness,
such as noxious sensations and panic; and premature death, as in sudden infant death syndrome
(Guyenet and Bayliss, 2015).
Neuronal networks in the parafacial respiratory group/retrotrapezoid nucleus (pFRG/RTN) and
the preBo
¨ tzinger complex (preBo
¨ tC) are important networks implicated in the central control of
breathing. pFRG/RTN paired-like homeobox 2b (Phox2b)-expressing neurons are sensitive to
changes in CO2 levels or their proxy, pH ([H+]) (Mellen and Thoby-Brisson, 2012; Onimaru and
Dutschmann, 2012). This responsiveness to hypercapnia is independent of synaptic transmission,
and the Phox2b+ neurons detect CO2/H+ via intrinsic proton receptors (TASK-2 and GPR4) in
parallel pathways (Kumar et al., 2015). Moreover, medullary astrocytes contribute to central che-
mosensitivity. Slight acidification leads to an increased astrocytic intracellular concentration of cal-
cium ions (Ca2+), resulting in vesicle-independent ATP release (Gourine et al., 2010).

 In addition, a CO2 sensitivity of astrocytes also mediates a vesicular-independent ATP release
(Huckstepp and Dale, 2011). Some connexins, which are expressed on astrocytes, e.g., connexin 26
(Cx26) and Cx30, are indeed sensitive to CO2 (Meigh et al., 2013; Reyes et al., 2014).
These cellular processes of chemosensitivity result in an altered respiratory pattern that lowers
the blood CO2 levels. Inflammation reduces the CO2 response and, particularly in neonatal mam-
mals, can induce sighs, an altered response to hypoxia and potentially life-threatening apnea epi-
sodes as shown in humans, sheep, piglets and rodents (Guerra et al., 1988; Long, 1988;
Herlenius, 2011; Siljehav et al., 2014; Koch et al., 2015; Siljehav et al., 2015).
In the inflammatory pathway, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is an important molecular mediator, that
together with its main receptor, the EP3R, play roles in the hypoxic and hypercapnic responses, e.g.
seen in patients with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (Kovesi et al., 2006; Siljehav et al., 2014;
Koch et al., 2015). PGE2 also seems to induce a sigh oriented respiratory pattern (Koch et al.,
2015). Sighs are regularly occurring events of augmented breaths with a biphasic inspiratory pattern
with the initial phase being comparable to eupnea and the second having larger amplitude
(Toporikova et al., 2015). Such breaths are necessary for life and have been linked to several patho-
logical states (Ramirez, 2014; Li et al., 2016).
Here, we hypothesized that both PGE2 and EP3R constitute parts of the respiratory machinery
and that they are involved in the induction of sighs and the hypercapnic response. We established a
viable brainstem organotypic slice culture that maintains respiratory-related activity for several weeks
in vitro and used this to investigate how PGE2 and EP3R alter breathing and control of chemosensi-
tivity. Our novel data reveal an important role of the EP3R in the pFRG/RTN hypercapnic response
and furthermore suggest that PGE2 is released during hypercapnia, possibly through CO2-sensitive
connexin hemichannels. Inflammation, with its associated PGE2 release, exogenous PGE2 and a lack
of EP3R, blunts the hypercapnic response. These data link the inflammatory and respiratory systems,
eLife digest Humans and other mammals breathe air to absorb oxygen into the body and to
remove carbon dioxide. We know that in a part of the brain called the brainstem, several regions
work together to create breaths, but it is not clear precisely how this works. These regions adjust
our breathing to the demands placed on the body by different activities, such as sleeping or
exercising. Sometimes, especially in newborn babies, the brainstem’s monitoring of oxygen and
carbon dioxide does not work properly, which can lead to abnormal breathing and possibly death.
In the brain, cells called neurons form networks that can rapidly transfer information via electrical
signals. Here, Forsberg et al. investigated the neural networks in the brainstem that generate and
control breathing in mice. They used slices of mouse brainstem that had been kept alive in a dish in
the laboratory. The slice contained an arrangement of neurons and supporting cells that allowed it
to continue to produce patterns of electrical activity that are associated with breathing. Over a
three-week period, Forsberg et al. monitored the activity of the cells and calculated how they were
connected to each other. The experiments show that the neurons responsible for breathing were
organized in a “small-world” network, in which the neurons are connected to each other directly or
via small numbers of other neurons.
Further experiments tested how various factors affect the behavior of the network. For example,
carbon dioxide triggered the release of a small molecule called prostaglandin E2 from cells. This
molecule is known to play a role in inflammation and fever. However, in the carbon dioxide sensing
region of the brainstem it acted as a signaling molecule that increased activity. Therefore,
inflammation could interfere with the body’s normal response to carbon dioxide and lead to
potentially life-threatening breathing problems. Furthermore, prostaglandin E2 induced deeper
breaths known as sighs, which may be vital for newborn babies to be able to take their first deep
breaths of life. Future challenges include understanding how the brainstem neural networks
generate breathing and translate this knowledge to improve the treatment of breathing difficulties
in babies.

 with implications for sighs and inspiration throughout life as well as for the ability to autoresuscitate
when breathing fails.
Results
EP3R is involved in respiratory control, sighs and the hypercapnic
response
To investigate the role of PGE2 and EP3R in respiration and sigh activity, we performed whole
body plethysmography on 9-day old mice. We found EP3R and its ligand PGE2 to be important
modulators of breathing and the response to hypercapnia (5% CO2 in normoxia; Table 1). The
sigh frequency increased after the intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of PGE2 (1 mM in 2–4 ml
artificial cerebrospinal fluid, aCSF) in an EP3R-dependent manner (Figure 1c–d, Table 2), as did
the tidal volume (VT) (during eupnea, excluding sighs) in wild-type mice (Figure 1e). Furthermore,
hypercapnic exposure also induced an increase in sigh frequency (Figure 1f, Table 2). This
increase was larger in wild-type mice than in mice lacking the EP3R (Ptger3-/- mice). This CO2-
induced increase in sigh frequency was abolished in wild-type mice after i.c.v. injection of PGE2
(Figure 1f, Table 2). The mice also responded to hypercapnia with increases in respiratory fre-
quency (FR), VT and minute ventilation (VE; Figure 1g). I.c.v. injection of PGE2 abolished the VT but
not the FR response during hypercapnia (Table 1). This provides new information on how PGE2
induces sigh activity and how increased PGE2 levels, as during inflammation, may both induce
sighs and attenuate responsiveness to CO2.
To unravel the mechanistic details of the PGE2-EP3R system in respiratory regulation and its con-
nection to the hypercapnic response and sighs, we set out to create a model system that would
allow long-term, detailed studies of the respiratory neural networks, i.e., networks with neurons as
well as glial cells.
Establishment of a viable respiratory brainstem organotypic slice
culture
Brainstem organotypic slice cultures of the mouse brainstem from 3-day-old mice were prepared
at the preBo
¨ tC brainstem level (Figure 2a). To validate this new model system, we first examined
Table 1. Respiratory parameters under basal conditions. Ptger3-/- mice are heavier than wild-type
mice of the same age. They do not, however, differ in respiratory frequency (FR), tidal volume (VT), or
minute ventilation (VE). I.c.v. injection of PGE2 increases VT and VE in wild-type mice but not Ptger3-/-
mice. Respiratory frequency, tidal volume, and minute ventilation all increased during hypercapnic
exposure. n: number of animals. Data are presented as mean ± SD.

 Figure 1. PGE2 and CO2 increase sigh activity via EP3R signaling. Respiratory activity was recorded in vivo in a two-chamber plethysmograph (a). Sighs,
defined by an increase in inspiratory volume and respiratory cycle period with a biphasic inspiration (b), increase in frequency after
intracerebroventricular injection (i.c.v.) of PGE2. This effect is absent in mice lacking EP3R (Ptger3-/-, c, arrows, d). I.c.v. injection of PGE2 also increases
the tidal volume (VT) in wild-type C57BL/6J (WT) mice (e). The sigh frequency is increased by hypercapnic (5% CO2 in normoxia) conditions in wild-type
and Ptger3-/- mice but less so in Ptger3-/- mice (f). In wild-type mice, the increase is abolished after i.c.v. injection of PGE2 (f). Hypercapnic exposure
causes an increase in respiratory frequency (FR), tidal volume (VT), and minute ventilation (VE) (g), but the increase is attenuated in Ptger3-/- mice. Data

Neural marker staining showed intact neu-

regions
were

well preserved (Figure 2b,e,g, Figure 2—figure

ular glutamate transporter 2 (VGlut2), similar to
that in vivo, indicates the functional potential of
the brainstem slice culture because glutamater-
gic synapses are essential for the development
of the breathing rhythm generator (Walle

Mackenzie et al., 2006) (Figure 2d). Neuronal
markers MAP2 and KCC2 (Kaila et al., 2014)
were expressed in the preBo

Figure 2—figure supplement 2). The protein
expression in the preBo
¨ tC remained stable for 3
weeks of cultivation (Figure 2—figure supple-
ment 1). The brainstem slice cultures became
thinner with longer cultivation as the tissue
spread out (Figure 2—figure supplement 2).
However, they remained viable and exhibited a
low degree of necrosis and apoptosis, even after
3 weeks (Figure 2—figure supplement 3).

After evaluating morphology, we investigated
the cellular activity within the brainstem slice

Neurons
in

cultures
retained their electrical properties at 7 days in
vitro (DIV), including a resting membrane poten-
tial of �55 ± 6 mV (Figure 3b–c) and overshoot-
ing action potentials (Figure 3c). The resting
membrane potential, action potential threshold,
half-width and peak amplitudes of the action
potential, and membrane time constant were
within the ranges of acute respiratory slices
(Figure 3c, Figure 3—figure supplement 1).
Action potentials occurred in clusters of regular
rhythmic bursting activity. Neuronal connections
were also similar to those seen immediately ex
vivo, e.g., in acute slices, (Ballanyi and Ruang-
kittisakul, 2009) as evidenced by the postsynap-
tic
potentials
and
concurrent
inputs
to
neighboring
neurons,
resulting
in
correlated
activity (Figure 3b, Figure 3—figure supple-
ment 1).
Thus, on an individual neuronal level, the cells
behave as expected. However, breathing is gen-
erated through cellular interactions in respira-
tion-related neural networks.
Figure 3. Neuronal electrical activity indicates
preserved networks. Neurons in a preBo
¨ tC slice (7 DIV),
patched in the whole-cell configuration in current-
clamp mode (a), exhibit regular rhythmic bursting
activity (b). The neurons exhibited a hyperpolarized
resting potential, action potentials, synaptic input, and
spontaneous electrical activity, with epochs of action
potential activity (b, c). The different measured
variables indicated healthy and normally functioning
neurons (d). Depicted here are two simultaneously
patched neurons that also received common synaptic
input (e, arrows). Spiking epochs occurred
simultaneously, suggesting synchronized network
oscillations. Direct connectivity between the depicted
neurons showed that they were neither chemically nor
electrically synaptically connected to each other. This
finding indicates that the observed correlation was
induced by common input from a preserved network
structure. AP: action potential. DIV: days in vitro.

 Figure 4. Neural activity in the preBo
¨ tC is arranged in a functional respiratory network with respiratory-related motor output. In the preBo
¨ tC slice (a), a
cross-correlation analysis of Ca2+ time-lapse imaging data (Figure 4—figure supplement 1) revealed small-world network-structured correlated activity
in the preBo
¨ tC (b–d). The number of correlating cell pairs did not change over time (e), nor did the small-world network parameter or connectivity (f).
TMR-SP-positive regions contained more correlated cell pairs than TMR-SP-negative regions (621 ± 284, N=14 and 56 ± 48, N=9, respectively; p<0.05),
although there was no difference in the number of active cells (112 ± 57, N=14 and 144 ± 68, N=9, respectively, N.S.; g). As in the preBo

 To investigate how individual cells interact, we applied live time-lapse Ca2+ imaging to allow
simultaneous recording of the activity of hundreds of cells. Tetramethyl rhodamine coupled Sub-
stance P (TMR-SP), visualizing NK1R-expressing neurons, was used to identify the preBo
¨ tC. In the
brainstem slice cultures, the preBo
¨ tC contained networks with correlated activity between cells
(Figure 4b–d), which was analyzed using a recently reported cross-correlation analysis method
(Smedler et al., 2014) (Figure 4—figure supplement 1). We found clusters of cells with highly cor-
related activity. Such groups of cells in close proximity to each other were interconnected via a few
cells that seem to function as hubs (Watts and Strogatz, 1998). The correlated network activity in
the preBo
¨ tC was preserved for 1, 2 and 3 weeks (Figure 4b–e). The number of active cells and the
correlations per active cell remained similar over time (Figure 4e). These data suggest that the brain-
stem slice culture approach can indeed be used to perform long-term studies of respiratory neural
network activity.
Analysis of the network structure revealed stable connectivity values (i.e., the number of cell
pairs with a correlation coefficient exceeding the cut-off value, divided by the total number of cell
pairs) during the cultivation of preBo
¨ tC slices for up to 3 weeks (Figure 4f, Table 3). These values
were slightly higher than those estimated in a previous study (Hartelt et al., 2008), in which only
neurons were accounted for. However, both neurons and glia are involved in respiratory control
(Erlichman et al., 2010; Giaume et al., 2010), and our analysis provides information on both cell
types. Moreover, other analyzed network parameters, i.e., the normalized mean path-length (l)
and the normalized mean clustering-coefficient (s), also remained stable (Figure 4f, Table 3).
Overall, the small-world parameter (Watts and Strogatz, 1998) g ¼ s
l was unchanged after 3
weeks in culture. Inhibiting the firing of action potentials and consequent activation of synapses by
tetrodotoxin (TTX, 20 nM) abolished the coordinated network activity and revealed a population
of cells that retained rhythmic alterations of cytosolic Ca2+ levels (31 ± 4% of the total number of
cells, N=14 slices). Most of these cells (76 ± 12%, N=14) were NK1R-positive neurons, indicating
the presence of functioning pacemaker neurons (Figure 4—figure supplement 2). The Ca2+ sig-
nals from synapse-independent cells remained, however with a lower frequency and higher coeffi-
cient of variation (Figure 4—figure supplement 2). Regions outside the brainstem nuclei
contained active cells, without intercellular coordination (Figure 4g). This cellular activity ceased
during TTX treatment. In conclusion, the brainstem slice cultures contain a preserved preBo
¨ tC net-
work with a small-world structure.
As the preBo
¨ tC delivers part of its motor output through the hypoglossal nerve (Smith et al.,
2009), we also examined the hypoglossal motor nucleus. In this region of the hypoglossal motor
nucleus, we found correlated cell activity organized similarly to that found in the preBo
¨ tC network
(Figure 4h). Within this network, frequency analysis revealed regularly spiking cells with a frequency
between 50 and 100 mHz, corresponding to a rhythmic motor neuron output of 3–6 bursts of respi-
ration-related activity/min (average 3.7 ± 0.9 bursts/min; Figure 4i). This suggests a preserved respi-
ratory-related output in the brainstem slice cultures.

 Figure 5. Breathing brainstem in a dish: ongoing/persistent rhythmic XII motor activity. The connected preBo

trace, above, and rectified and smoothed trace, below). DAMGO lowered the Ca2+. In the hypoglossal nucleus, DAMGO (0.5 mM) lowered the

 Subsequent recordings of extracellular poten-
tials from the 12th cranial nerve and hypoglossal
nucleus
revealed
a
corresponding
rhythmic
respiratory-related output at 7 (N=16), 14 (N=3),
and 21 DIV (N=6). Respiratory output from acute
slices varied between 1 and 8 bursts per min
(neonatal mice, 3 mM K+), with frequencies in
the lower range after a longer incubation time
in
vitro
(Ramirez
et
al.,
1997;
Ruangkittisakul et al., 2011). In our model we
observed a respiratory-related frequency of 3.7
± 2.5 bursts per min (average of frequencies at
7, 14 and 21 DIV, no significant difference was
observed between different DIV, Figure 5a),
which is within the expected range for a slice.
Among individual cultures, there was some vari-
ability in frequency (Figure 5a). However, the
intrinsic rhythm was stable, with an average
coefficient of variation of 22 ± 8 (no difference
between the different DIV, Figure 5b). Rhythmic XII activity was observed for more than 2 hr during
recordings (Figure 5—figure supplement 1).The activity could be inhibited by a m-opioid receptor
agonist, [D-Ala2, N-Me-Phe4, Gly5-ol]-enkephalin (DAMGO, 0.5 mM; Figure 5c, Figure 5—figure
supplement 1) and stimulated by NK1R agonist Substance P (1 mM; 19 ± 13% increase in frequency,
p<0.05; N=7; Figure 5—figure supplement 1).
In the preBo
¨ tC, DAMGO also inhibited the Ca2+ activity of individual NK1R+ neurons and lowered
the network frequency significantly (Figure 5d, Video 1). This was accompanied by an increase in
the coefficient of variation in this area (36 ± 4 vs. 47 ± 6, N=7 slices, p<0.05). The network structure
was not affected. An increase in [K+] from 3 mM to 9 mM, with subsequent membrane potential
depolarization, increased the frequency in the preBo
¨ tC (Figure 5e). In the hypoglossal nucleus,
DAMGO caused a frequency reduction in the regularly spiking cells (Figure 5f,g). Thus, the preBo
¨ tC
brainstem slice culture remained active and responsive and generated rhythmic respiration-related
motor output activity.
Gap junctions are essential parts of correlated preBo
¨ tC activity
Gap junction signaling plays an important role in the development of the respiratory system, the
maintenance of respiratory output and likely the CO2/pH response (Elsen et al., 2008; Fortin and
Thoby-Brisson, 2009; Gourine et al., 2010; Huckstepp et al., 2010a). Thus, we used the brainstem
slice cultures to investigate the involvement of gap junctions in the neural networks and their
response to CO2.
In the brainstem slice cultures, immunohistochemistry showed high Cx43 expression in neurons
of the preBo
¨ tC (Figure 6a) and lower and persistent Cx26 and Cx32 expression in the respiratory
regions (Figure 6b–d) at 7 DIV. To assess the function of these intercellular gap junctions and
hemichannels, we treated the brainstem slice cultures at 7 DIV with gap junction inhibitors carbe-
noxolone (CBX) or 18a-glycyrrhetinic acid (18-a-GA). Both inhibitors decreased the number of
correlating cell pairs and active cells in the preBo
¨ tC, whereas glycyrrhizic acid (GZA), an analog
to CBX that lacks the ability to block gap junctions, and the aCSF control did not (Figure 6e–g,
k–l). However, the individual activity of NK1R expressing neurons was not affected (Figure 6h–j,
m). These findings suggest a role for gap junctions in the maintenance of correlated network
activity in the preBo
¨ tC.
Conversely the rhythmic activity of NK1R+ neurons does not depend on gap junctions. Moreover,
gap junction inhibition did not affect the mean correlation values, connectivity, or small-world
parameter of the remaining correlated cell pairs (Figure 6—figure supplement 1). This demon-
strates that the cells connected in a gap junction-independent manner are organized as a small-
world network. These results are in line with topological data showing that respiratory neurons are
organized in small clusters in the preBo
¨ tC (Hartelt et al., 2008).

(a, N=9), Cx32 (b, c, N=8), and Cx26 (d, arrowheads; double-labeling with NK1R, N=5) are present. Gap junction inhibitors CBX (e) and 18-a-GA (f)
reduced network synchronization in the preBo

pair numbers decreased to 21% (N=8) and 20% (N=6) of their respective controls after treatment with CBX and 18-a-GA, respectively (k). Network
properties were not affected by GZA, an analog to CBX that lacks the ability to block gap junctions, (g, j–k, N=7) or aCSF (N=8). An initial increase in
fluorescence intensity was noted after adding CBX and GZA but not after adding 18-a-GA, indicating an immediate excitatory effect of CBX and GZA
(l). 18-a-GA reduced the number of active cells in the network at 1 min after application (53%), but CBX did not (91%, N.S.). At the same time point, an
increased number of active cells were observed with GZA treatment (139%). After 10 min, a reduction of the number of active cells was found after

 PGE2 modulates preBo
¨ tC activity
Our in vivo data, as well as others’, indicate that PGE2 and hypercapnia induce sigh activity (Ram-
irez, 2014; Koch et al., 2015). We hypothesized that this is due to effects on the respiratory centers
in the brainstem. We used our brainstem slice cultures of the preBo
¨ tC to study the direct effects of
PGE2 and hypercapnia in vitro.
PGE2 levels in cerebrospinal fluid measured in experimental models and in human infants are in
the pico- to nanomolar range (Hofstetter et al., 2007). In the brainstem slice cultures at 7 DIV,
the application of PGE2 (10 nM) lowered the Ca2+ signaling frequency of respiratory neurons in
the preBo
¨ tC (Figure 7a–b). PGE2 also induced longer Ca2+ transients, and the signal amplitudes
increased compared to those of the controls (Figure 7b). Koch and colleagues (Koch et al., 2015)
suggested that the increase in sighs induced by PGE2 is mediated through persistent sodium chan-
nels (INaP) (Koch et al., 2015). Indeed, in the preBo
¨ tC, 10 mM Riluzole, a blocker of the persistent
sodium current (INaP), attenuated effect of PGE2 on Ca2+ signal amplitude and length as well as
decreasing the signal frequency (Figure 7b). As in previous studies (Toporikova et al., 2015), Rilu-
zole did not affect the Ca2+ signal compared to control periods. Riluzole is used as an INaP blocker,
but may also affect other parts of neuronal signaling, such as glutamate release (Wang et al.,
2004). Therefore, we cannot completely determine whether the PGE2 effect is due to an effect on
the persistent sodium current or interference with glutamate signaling, although an effect on INaP
is likely (Koch et al., 2015).
EP3Rs were present in the preBo
¨ tC (Figure 7c–d). qRT-PCR showed that 20% of the EP3Rs were
of the a-subtype (Figure 7e). EP3Ra inhibits adenylate cyclase via Gi-protein, and reduced cAMP
levels inhibit FR (Ballanyi et al., 1997). The EP3Rg subtype, however, which couples to the GS-pro-
tein, was the most abundant (Figure 7e).
In vivo, hypercapnia increases sigh activity, VT, FR, and VE (Figure 1). Therefore, we exposed the
preBo
¨ tC brainstem slice culture to increased levels of CO2 by raising the pCO2 levels from 4.6 kPa
to hypercapnic 6.6 kPa, while maintaining a constant pH of 7.5 in the aCSF by the addition of bicar-
bonate. This did not have any effect on the Ca2+ signaling frequency, the Ca2+ signaling pattern or
the network structure in wild-type or Ptger3-/- mice (Figure 7f–g, Figure 7—figure supplement 1).
However, the preBo
¨ tC is not the main central chemosensitive region. Instead, the sensitivity to CO2
is more profound in the pFRG. Therefore, we generated organotypic slice cultures of the pFRG/RTN
brainstem level.
The pFRG/RTN respiratory region exhibited correlated network activity
and retained CO2 sensitivity
The analysis of network structure and function that we conducted on the preBo
¨ tC was previously
not possible to perform in the pFRG/RTN on acute transverse slices. Studies of the pFRG/RTN
are particularly interesting because of its crucial role in central respiratory chemosensitivity
(Onimaru et al., 2009). We therefore created the same type of brainstem slice culture as with
the preBo
¨ tC slice using slices containing the pFRG/RTN instead (Figure 8a). These brainstem slice
cultures expressed neuronal markers as expected (Figure 8b–d, Figure 8—figure supplement 1)
and displayed retention of electrical properties, in a manner similar to the preBo
¨ tC brainstem slice
cultures (Figure 8e–f).

 Figure 9. The pFRG/RTN respiration-related network generates correlated neural activity and responds to CO2.
The pFRG/RTN network is arranged in a small-world manner just ventral to the facial nucleus. The network
structure was preserved during cultivation (a–d). The number of correlating cell pairs did not change with longer
culturing times, but the number of active cells was higher at 3 weeks than at 2 weeks (45 ± 27<76 ± 19, p<0,05; e).
The network parameters were stable during cultivation (f). The pFRG/RTN network did not respond to the m-
opioid receptor agonist DAMGO (0.5 mM; n=420, N=4; a), but the average network frequency increased with
higher potassium concentrations (22 ± 5 mHz and 38 ± 7 mHz, N=12; b). Both the neural network and individual
NK1R/TMR-SP-labeled cells responded to increases in CO2 pressure (pCO2 elevated to 6.6 kPa), indicating that
the chemosensitivity was preserved in the pFRG/RTN brainstem slice culture. Suramin, a P2 receptor antagonist,
and TNP-APT, a P2X receptor antagonist, attenuated the CO2 response but did not abolish it (g). DIV: days in

 Looking at multiple cells using time-lapse Ca2+ imaging, the activity of the pFRG/RTN was corre-
lated in a scale-free small-world network, akin the one in the preBo
¨ tC (Figure 9b–d) and was stable
during cultivation (Figure 9e–f). There was a slight difference in the number of active cells between
2 week and 3 week cultures (Figure 7e). However, all network properties remained unchanged
(Figure 9f and Table 4). The inhibition of neuronal spiking and synapses by TTX (20 nM) disrupted
the coordinated activity (21 ± 9% of correlated cell pairs remained, N=11). However, rhythmic Ca2+
activity persisted in a subset of primarily (64 ± 9%, N=11) NK1R-positive cells (Figure 9—figure sup-
plement 1). The pFRG/RTN cells did not exhibit any change in signaling frequency after DAMGO
application (Figure 9g, average levels from 7-, 14-, and 21-DIV cultures are displayed, as there were
no significant differences among cultures of these ages), confirming the absence of preBo
¨ tC m-opi-
oid-sensitive regions in these slices (Ballanyi and Ruangkittisakul, 2009). Similarly to the preBo
¨ tC
brainstem slice culture, the pFRG/RTN responded to higher [K+] with an increase in frequency
(Figure 9h; average levels from 7-, 14-, and 21-DIV cultures are displayed, as there were no signifi-
cant differences among cultures of these ages).
Next we examined the CO2 sensitivity of the pFRG/RTN (Onimaru et al., 2008). This resulted in
increased signal frequency of the Ca2+ oscillations (Figure 9i, Table 5, Video 2; data from 7-DIV cul-
tures are displayed, and no significant differences in the response among 7-, 14-, and 21-DIV cul-
tures were observed) and the activation of some previously dormant cells. During hypercapnic

 exposure,
the
pFRG/RTN
network
topology
remained essentially unchanged (Figure 9—fig-
ure supplement 2).
Response to hypercapnia involves pFRG/RTN
astrocytes, which release ATP that acts on puri-
nergic P2-receptors (Erlichman et al., 2010;
Gourine et al., 2010; Huckstepp et al., 2010a).
We sought to examine whether this kind of sig-
naling pathway was active in the 7-DIV brainstem
slice cultures, and we found that blocking puri-
nergic
receptors
with
Suramin
or
TNP-ATP
application
did not abolish the hypercapnic
response,
in
agreement
with
previous
data
(Sobrinho et al., 2014). However, both the
unspecific P2 receptor and the more specific
P2X receptor antagonist attenuated the CO2
response by approximately one third (30 ± 6%;
Figure 9i), as observed in adult and neonatal
rats (Wenker et al., 2012) and 9-day-old mice (Gourine et al., 2010). Thus, the CO2-induced release
of ATP acting on P2 receptors may contribute to the CO2 response.
In conclusion, our brainstem organotypic slice culture contains an active pFRG/RTN network
that retains its structural integrity over time and responds to CO2 exposure with increased
activity.
The CO2 response is dependent on EP3R signaling and gap junctions
Gap junctions, both intercellular and hemichannels, are linked to respiratory chemosensitivity
(Huckstepp et al., 2010a; Meigh et al., 2013; Reyes et al., 2014). Recently, CO2 was shown to
interact with the hemichannel Cx26, inducing an open state through the formation of carbamate
bridges, thus increasing the release of compounds such as ATP (Meigh et al., 2013). Therefore, we
hypothesized that gap junctions exert functions within the pFRG/RTN network. However, gap junc-
tion inhibitors did not affect signaling frequency or network topology of the pFRG/RTN (Figure 10a,
Figure 10—figure supplement 1). Instead, the frequency response to hypercapnia was both inhib-
ited and reversed by the application of the gap junction inhibitor 18-a-GA (Figure 10b–c). GZA (a
structural analog of CBX without gap junction-inhibiting properties) did not alter the CO2 response
(Figure 10b–c).
We conclude that 18-a-GA inhibits the hypercapnic response, while inhibition of purinergic signal-
ing pathways attenuates it. Thus, we suggest that the CO2 response is not entirely explained by the
connexin-mediated release of ATP. Furthermore, inflammation via PGE2 and EP3R alters the hyper-
capnic response in vivo and in brainstem spinal cord en bloc preparations (Figure 1 and Siljehav and
colleagues Figures 1 and 4 [Siljehav et al., 2014]). Therefore, we hypothesized that hypercapnic
responses involve PGE2 signaling and next analyzed the PGE2 content of the aCSF under control
and hypercapnic conditions. In all examined slices (N=12/12, 7 DIV), a transient doubling of the
PGE2 concentration after pCO2 elevation was evident (Figure 11). When gap junction blockers were
applied, this peak was absent (N=4/4, 7 DIV; Figure 11). This indicates a hypercapnia-induced, gap
junction-mediated release of PGE2.
Immunohistochemistry showed expression of microsomal prostaglandin E synthase 1 (mPGEs-1)
in GFAP positive astrocytes (Figure 11—figure supplement 1). mPGEs-1, the main PGE2 producing
enzyme, has previously been found mainly in endothelial cells of the blood brain barrier of adult rats
(Yamagata et al., 2001). Our findings suggest that astrocytes in the vicinity of the ventral brainstem
border of neonates express mPGEs-1 and might therefore be candidates for modulation of breath-
ing through CO2-induced release of PGE2.

However, as hypercapnia seems to induce a release of PGE2 while stimulating breathing activity,
we hypothesized that PGE2 has a direct stimulatory effect on the pFRG/RTN. Indeed, PGE2
increased the signaling frequency of pFRG/RTN neurons (Figure 12a–b, Table 6). This effect was

responses (CO2") were abolished when gap junctions were inhibited by 18-a-GA (b, top trace; c, left graph, N=7). GZA (a structural analog of CBX
without gap junction-inhibiting properties) increased the frequency, and hypercapnia increased it further (b, middle trace; c, middle graph, N=7). An
initiated hypercapnic response was attenuated but not completely reversed by 18-a-GA (b, bottom trace; c, lower graph, N=5). This dynamic was not
seen after application of GZA. DIV: days in vitro. Scale bars: 200 mm. N: number of slices. Multicolored bar: color-coded correlation coefficient values.

 EP3R dependent, and EP3Rs were present in the pFRG/RTN, expressed both on respiratory neu-
rons and on astrocytes (Figure 12c–e). We also observed a non-significant increase in amplitude (8
± 3% and 11 ± 4% increase compared to control period, N.S.). Neither the PGE2 effect nor the
hypercapnic response of the pFRG/RTN was affected by Riluzole (30 ± 5 mHz vs 25 ± 2 mHz, N.S.,
N=6, and 36 ± 2 mHz vs 35 ± 6 mHz, N.S., N=6). qRT-PCR showed abundant expression of the
EP3Rg subtype, which couples to the GS-protein (Namba et al., 1993). This would lead to an
increase in intracellular cAMP in the pFRG/RTN Ptger3-expressing cells in response to PGE2
(Figure 12f).

were inhibited (18-a-GA, blue line), the PGE2 levels remained unaltered during hypercapnia (N=4). The average PGE2 level throughout the whole

 Figure 12. PGE2 alters respiratory network activity. In the pFRG/RTN, PGE2 increased the frequency of respiratory (NK1R-expressing) neurons. This

 To further characterize the PGE2 signaling during hypercapnia, we blocked its main receptor,
EP3R. Notably, pharmacological blocking of EP receptors (using AH6809, 10 mM) abolished the
hypercapnic response (Figure 13a–b, 7 DIV), in line with our in vivo data from Ptger3-/- mice.
pFRG/RTN slices (7 DIV) from Ptger3-/- mice did not respond to hypercapnia (Figure 13c–d).
Thus, EP3R is important for pFRG/RTN CO2 responsiveness. We next generated a lentiviral vector in
which the mouse EP3R (Ptger3) promoter controls the expression of the red light-activated halorho-
dopsin Halo57 fused to eGFP (Figure 13e). After transduction, we detected eGFP expression in 90
± 6% of Phox2b-positive neurons in the pFRG/RTN (Figure 13—figure supplement 1). Stimulation
by red (625 nm) light of the transduced brainstem slice cultures (7 DIV) triggered hyperpolarization
of Ptger3-halo57-expressing cells and immediately reduced the calcium signaling frequency of both
the network and individual NK1R+ neurons (Figure 13—figure supplement 1). This finding indicates
a fundamental role for Ptger3-expressing cells in the network. Additionally, the response to hyper-
capnia in the pFRG/RTN was abolished during the light-induced silencing of Ptger3-expressing cells.
The CO2 response was also reversed by the light-induced halo57 hyperpolarization of Ptger-
expressing cells (Figure 13f–g, Table 7).
Based on these findings, we suggest that the PGE2-EP3R pathway is an important mechanism in
the hypercapnic response and a modulator of respiratory activity.
Discussion
Here, we present two novel breathing brainstem organotypic cultures in which the respiration-
related preBo
¨ tC and pFRG/RTN regions maintain their functional organization, activity, and respon-
siveness to environmental cues. Using these cultures, we show that PGE2 is involved in the control of

pFRG/RTN (N=6, n=472, N.S.; a–b). The hypercapnic response was also absent in pFRG/RTN slices lacking EP3R

optogenetic silencing of Ptger3-expressing cells, no frequency changes were observed in response to hypercapnia

 sigh activity and the response to hypercapnia via EP3R in the preBo
¨ tC and the pFRG/RTN, respec-
tively. These findings provide novel insights into central respiratory central pattern generation, its
modulation, and the mechanisms underlying breathing disorders during the neonatal period.
Due to the complexity of the respiratory mechanisms, it is difficult to create optimal in vitro
model systems that represent in vivo conditions while allowing sufficient depth in detailed mecha-
nisms and their manipulation. The majority of previous studies were performed on brainstem-spinal
cord preparations (en bloc) (Onimaru, 1995) or acute slices (Ruangkittisakul et al., 2006). However,
these preparations remain active only for hours, making it difficult to study development and long-
term effects on respiratory rhythm. Organotypic slice cultures provide a bridge between cell cultures
and animals in vivo (Yamada and Cukierman, 2007). Their preserved three dimensional structure
allows functional circuits to be studied and manipulated over time under microenvironmental control
(Ga

et al., 1997;
Gogolla
et al., 2006;
Yamada and Cukierman,

Preynat-
Seauve et al., 2009). First used with hippocampal tissue (Ga
¨hwiler, 1988), the organotypic culturing
method has since expanded to research on the cerebellum (Lu et al., 2011) as well as on the brain-
stem
auditory
circuits
(Thonabulsombat
et
al.,
2007).
Recently,
Phillips
and
colleagues
(Phillips et al., 2016) presented an organotypic model system of the preBo
¨ tzinger complex with res-
piration-related neuronal rhythm that persists for a month. Here, we characterize this new type of
brainstem slice culture further, and also provide details on respiratory network structure and func-
tional respiratory-related motor output. In addition we show that also the pFRG/RTN retains respira-
tion-related rhythmic activity and chemosensitivity. As with all model systems, it has its limitations, e.
g., the slices lose several respiratory-related regions (Smith et al., 2009). Nonetheless, in contrast to
acute slices and the brainstem-spinal cord preparation, our new experimental model system allows
long-term studies and manipulation of respiratory networks. This enables the use of different techni-
ques and methods, and significantly reduces the number of procedures that otherwise need to be
performed on live animals, as well as the total number of experimental animals. We have exploited
this advantage by transfecting the brainstem slice cultures in vitro to be suitable for optogenetic
techniques.
Using a newly developed cross-correlation analysis algorithm (Smedler et al., 2014), we revealed
in the brainstem slice culture, a clustering of cells within the two central pattern generators, a small-
world network. A small-world network is characterized by a mean clustering coefficient exceeding
that in random networks, but has a mean shortest path-length as short as that in random networks
(Watts and Strogatz, 1998; Malmersjo et al., 2013). Furthermore, the presence of the connective
nodes and hubs gives the network a scale-free organization. This finding is in line with a previous
topological analysis based on neuronal staining in the preBo
¨ tC (Hartelt et al., 2008). The present
insights into the network structure of the pFRG/RTN have not been achieved previously with other
methods. Notably, scale-free and small-world networks have been suggested to have evolutionary
advantages (Barabasi and Oltvai, 2004; Malmersjo et al., 2013).
Subsequently we examined how the networks and individual cells were connected. Early in devel-
opment, gap junctions connect the respiration-related fetal neural networks (Thoby-Brisson et al.,
2009). During development, gap junction-mediated Ca2+-transients stimulate the proliferation of
neural progenitor cells (Malmersjo et al., 2013) and form a template for chemical synapses to coor-
dinate more mature neural networks (Jaderstad et al., 2010). Using CBX and 18-a-GA, we demon-
strated that intercellular connections still play a role in postnatal preBo
¨ tC network activity. This is in
line with previous findings (Elsen et al., 2008). Notably, even though fewer cells remained active,
respiratory neuron frequency and network structure were not affected. Although both CBX and 18-
a-GA are commonly used as gap junction inhibitors (Solomon et al., 2003; Elsen et al., 2008;
Ve
´liz et al., 2008; Jaderstad et al., 2010), these drugs have side effects (Rekling et al., 2000;
Schnell et al., 2012). We used GZA as a control substance because it is structurally similar to CBX
but does not have any gap junction inhibiting properties (Solomon et al., 2003; Li and Duffin,
2004; Elsen et al., 2008). However, it mimics many of the side effects of CBX, e.g. the initial stimula-
tory effect seen in the present study. These limitations need to be kept in mind when interpreting
our results on gap junction functions, and further studies are needed to confirm them, preferably
using more specific methods of connexin blockage, such as RNAi.
However, our findings do suggest the presence of a neuron-specific subnetwork, connected by
chemical synapses, that is able to maintain the network structure. Furthermore, another subnetwork,
likely a glial one (Giaume et al., 2010; Okada et al., 2012) driven by the electrical connections that

 modulate network output also seems to be present. Thus, neonatal preBo
¨ tC synchronization is both
gap junction-and synaptic signal-dependent (Feldman and Kam, 2015), and it probably contains
both neuronal and glial subnetworks. The pFRG/RTN, by contrast, requires gap junctions for its
establishment in rodents but is not dependent on them postnatally for rhythmic, correlated network
activity (Fortin and Thoby-Brisson, 2009). The main mechanism that drives activity in the pFRG/RTN
is glutamatergic (Guyenet et al., 2013). By contrast, pFRG/RTN gap junctions seem here to be
involved in the hypercapnic response (Figure 10 and 11). It has been suggested that Cx26 is directly
modulated by CO2, independent of H+, through the formation of carbamate bridges (Meigh et al.,
2013). Our data do not distinguish between intracellular pH-dependent and -independent mecha-
nisms. However, since PGE2 can pass through connexins (Reyes et al., 2014), the present data are
in line with a CO2-induced, connexin-mediated, release of PGE2 (Figure 14).
Prostaglandins are important regulators of autonomic functions in mammals. In many disease
states, acute inflammatory responses are initially protective but become harmful under chronic con-
ditions. In our previous reports, we demonstrated how the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-
1b impairs respiration during infection by inducing a PGE2 release in the vicinity of respiratory cen-
ters. We also showed that infection is the main cause of respiratory disorders in preterm infants
(Hofstetter et al., 2007, 2008) and, in the case of apneas, bradycardias and desaturations (ABD)
events in neonates (Siljehav et al., 2015). PGE2 is also a key component in the regulation of sigh fre-
quency (Ramirez, 2014; Koch et al., 2015). During and immediately after birth, PGE2 levels are
increased (Mitchell et al., 1978). Indeed, the first breaths of extrauterine life are deep and sigh-like,
Figure 14. Model of how PGE2 modulates respiration and sighs in the preBo
¨ tC and pFRG/RTN. Systemic inflammation, through the proinflammatory
cytokine IL-1b and hypoxia, induces the production of PGE2 in blood brain barrier (BBB) endothelial cells (Hofstetter et al., 2007).PGE2 subsequently
induces respiratory depression and increases sigh activity via the inhibitory G-protein coupled receptor EP3Ra in the preBo
¨ tC. In the pFRG/RTN, PGE2
plays a role in the response to elevated pCO2. CO2 directly modulates connexin 26 (Cx26) hemichannels, leading to ATP release. The results in this
study suggest that Cx26 also releases PGE2, possiblyfrom mPGEs-1+ astrocytes. PGE2 increases respiratory activity via the stimulatory G-protein
coupled receptor EP3Rg on pFRG/RTN neurons. Thus, inflammation, hypoxia, and hypercapnia alter respiratory neural network and motor output and
breathing activity through distinct effects of PGE2 in the pFRG/RTN and the preBo
¨ tC, respectively. Chronically elevated PGE2 levels, as observed during
ongoing inflammation, may decrease the central pattern generators’ ability to respond to hypoxic and hypercapnic events. In extreme cases, this
decrease may have fatal consequences.

 facilitating

and
CO2
removal (Mian et al., 2015). In the brainstem
slice cultures, PGE2 had a direct EP3R-depen-
dent effect on both respiratory centers. Notably,
PGE2 increased pFRG/RTN but inhibited pre-
Bo
¨ tC frequency (Video 3). This finding might be
explained by the different distributions of EP3R
subtypes in the different regions (Figure 12).
The coupling to inhibitory or stimulatory G pro-
teins depends on the alternative post-transcrip-
tional splicing of the C-terminal tail of the EP3R
preprotein (Namba et al., 1993). Furthermore,
PGE2 caused a longer Ca2+ transient and a
higher relative amplitude in an INaP-dependent
manner, mimicking the PGE2-based induction of
sighs that we observe in vivo and that were
recently reported by Koch and colleagues in
acute preBo
¨ tC slices (Koch et al., 2015).
Recent data reveal a role of neuromedin B
(NMB) and gastrin-related peptide (Grp) and
NMB-GPR-expressing preBo
¨ tC neurons in sigh-
ing (Li et al., 2016). In addition to these peptidergic pathways, the present and recent data from
Koch and colleagues (Koch et al., 2015) suggest that low concentrations of the inflammation-associ-
ated PGE2 induce sighs, acting through modulation of the persistent sodium current in preBo
¨ tC
neurons.
The preBo
¨ tC results presented in this study provide evidence for how the general respiratory

and
in

(Hofstetter et al., 2007) and in human neonates (Hofstetter et al., 2007; Siljehav et al., 2015), is
mediated by a direct effect of PGE2 on EP3R (Siljehav et al., 2012) in the preBo
¨ tC. The present
data may help to further explain the mechanism underlying apneas that occur during infectious peri-
ods in neonates (Hofstetter et al., 2007, 2008; Di Fiore et al., 2013; Siljehav et al., 2015).
Another common respiratory problem in neonates, particularly premature infants, is an inability to
respond adequately to hypoxia and hypercapnia. This may cause recurrent hypoxia, leading to cog-
nitive disabilities later in life (Greene et al., 2014). A disruption of central CO2 chemosensitivity is
commonly seen in children with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (Di Fiore et al., 2013), leading to
chronic hypoventilation, which may explain why these infants have an increased risk of sudden infant
death syndrome (Martin et al., 2011). Therefore, we investigated the role of the pFRG/RTN in che-
mosensitivity (Guyenet et al., 2013) and found that the response to hypercapnia is dependent on
functioning gap junctions. This is in line with previous findings showing that Cx26 is directly modified
by CO2 (Meigh et al., 2013).
These CO2-sensitive connexin hemichannels can release ATP, and indeed the hypercapnic
response is partly mediated by purinergic type 2 receptors (Erlichman et al., 2010; Gourine et al.,
2010; Guyenet et al., 2013). In addition to these purinergic pathways, we suggest that EP3R-
dependent signaling is involved in the response to altered pCO2. Genetic ablation of Ptger3
reduced the hypercapnic response both in vivo and in vitro, as did pharmacological blockage in
vitro, in line with our previous experiments (Siljehav et al., 2014). Moreover, the optogenetic inhibi-
tion of Ptger3-expressing cells in the pFRG/RTN revealed that these cells are essential for the CO2
response. We also demonstrated that PGE2 is released during hypercapnic exposure, likely through
Cx26 or other CO2-sensitive connexins (Huckstepp et al., 2010b). Thus, part of the CO2 response
seems to be mediated by a gap junction-dependent release of PGE2.
Generation of active expiration is another important function of the pFRG/RTN (Feldman et al.,
2013). It is possible that PGE2 stimulates both chemosensitive neurons and neurons important for
active expiration. Such neuronal populations could overlap, but the ventral part pFRG/RTN seems to
have a more chemosensitive character while the lateral part displays rhythmic activity and enforces
active expiration when stimulated (Pagliardini et al., 2011; Feldman et al., 2013; Huckstepp et al.,
2015). The CO2-sensing of the pFRG/RTN slice remains functional. Whether the rhythmic activity we

 observe in the pFRG/RTN is generated by “active expiration-neurons” is outside the scope of the
present study. Future studies should aim to investigate whether PGE2 also may affect active
expiration.
The pFRG/RTN is the best-recognized central chemosensitive region. However, in our pFRG/RTN
brainstem slice culture, neurons of the raphe nucleus should be present (Smith et al., 2009). Such
neurons may also have chemosensing properties (Richerson, 2004), though this has not been shown
conclusively (Depuy et al., 2011). From the raphe nucleus there are evidence of projections to the
pFRG/RTN (Guyenet et al., 2009), and we cannot exclude the possibility that these are preserved in
the brainstem slice culture.
The effects of CO2 in the present study are based on a change in carbamylation of specific pro-
teins, e.g. Cx26 (Meigh et al., 2013), or intracellular pH, but testing these alternatives goes beyond
the scope of the present work. In our experimental setup the extracellular pH remained stable while
the dissolved CO2 increased. This specific approach was selected because CO2 has a direct modulat-
ing effect on connexins, allowing passage of small molecules (Huckstepp et al., 2010a;
Huckstepp and Dale, 2011; Meigh et al., 2013), and our hypothesis was that PGE2 is released
through such connexins.
What still remains to be determined the exact source of the PGE2 released during hypercap-
nia. The indication of a gap junction-dependent release of PGE2 together with the presence of
mPGEs-1 in pFRG/RTN astrocytes suggests that the PGE2 is of astrocytic origin. This would be in
line with previous findings of astrocytic ATP release during hypercapnia (Gourine et al., 2010;
Huckstepp et al., 2010a). The astrocytic involvement in the CO2 response is also evident in a
Rett syndrome model (methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) knockout), in which conditional
MeCP2 knockout in astroglia blunts the CO2 response (Turovsky et al., 2015). We think that
mPGEs-1-expressing astrocytes are the likely source, even though alternative sources of PGE2,
such as endothelial cells or microglia, remain to be investigated with regards to their possible
involvement in the pFRG CO2 response. Nonetheless, CO2-mediated PGE2 release introduces a
novel chemosensitive pathway (Figure 14).
As PGE2 and the EP3R are directly involved in and modulate both the respiratory rhythm-gen-
erating preBo
¨ tC and the Phox2b chemosensitive neurons, PGE2 from other sources, such as
endothelial cells during hypoxia and inflammation (Hofstetter et al., 2007), will alter the hyper-
capnic and the hypoxic responses. PGE2 has prominent respiratory depressant effects in humans,
sheep,
pigs,
and
rodents
(Guerra
et
al.,
1988;
Long,
1988;
Ballanyi
et
al.,
1997;
Hofstetter et al., 2007; Siljehav et al., 2015). The PGE2-induced attenuation of these vital brain-
stem neural networks, e.g., during an infectious response, could result in gasping, autoresuscita-
tion failure and ultimately death. However, how chronic PGE2 release associated with ongoing
inflammation alters plasticity and the responsiveness to CO2 must be further investigated.
To conclude, we identified a novel pathway in the hypercapnic response of brainstem neural
networks that control breathing. This pathway depends on EP3R and gap junctions and is partly
mediated by the release of PGE2, linking chemosensitivity control to the inflammatory system. The
present findings have important implications for understanding why and how ventilatory responses
to hypoxia and hypercapnia are impaired and inhibitory reflexes exaggerated in neonates, particu-
larly during infectious episodes.

C57 black (C57BL/6J) inbred mice (Charles River, Wilmington, MA) were utilized in the experiments.
The eicosanoid prostanoid 3 receptor (EP3R) gene (Ptger3) was selectively deleted in knockout mice
(Ptger3�/�) with a C57BL/6J background, as described preciously (Fabre et al., 2001). C57BL/6J
mice were then used as experimental controls for Ptger3�/� mice. As results from Ptger3�/� mice
were consistent with pharmacological and optogenetic inhibition of EP3Rs, we can confirm the lost
EP3R function in the mice.
To determine the location of mPGEs-1, mice expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) under
the GFAP promoter were used. Frozen sperm from the GFAP-tTA (Lin et al., 2004; Pascual et al.,
2005) and tetO-Mrgpra1 (Fiacco et al., 2007) mouse strains were purchased from the Mutant

 Mouse Regional Resource Centers supported by NIH (MMRRC). The strains were re-derived by Karo-
linska Center for Transgene Technologies (KCTT), and the offspring was crossed as previously
described (Fiacco et al., 2007). Double transgenics were identified by PCR according to MMRRC’s
instructions.
All mice were reared by their mothers under standardized conditions with a 12:12-hr light-dark
cycle. Food and water was provided ad libitum. The studies were performed in accordance with
European Community Guidelines and approved by the regional ethic committee. The animals were
reared and kept at the Department of Comparative Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm,
Sweden.
Dual-chamber plethysmography in vivo
Ventilatory measurements were made using dual-chamber plethysmography in 9-day old (P9) mice.
Mice were cooled on ice for 2–3 min and then prostaglandin E2 (PGE2, 1 mM; Sigma-Aldrich, St.
Louis, MO, USA, cat no. P5640) or vehicle (artificial cerebrospinal fluid, aCSF, containing in mM:
150.1 Na+, 3 K+, 2 Ca2+, 2 Mg2+, 135 Cl�, 1.1 H2PO4
�, 25 HCO3
- and 10 glucose) was slowly
injected into the lateral ventricle by using a thin pulled glass pipette attached to polyethylene tubing
(Siljehav et al., 2014). The mouse was then immediately placed into the plethysmograph chamber.
After a 10-min recovery period, confirming stable respiration and body temperature, respiratory
parameters in normocapnia (air) was established followed by a hypercapnic challenge (5% CO2 and
20% O2 in N2) for 5 min. This was followed by 5 min of normocapnia. Skin temperature was mea-
sured throughout experimentation and remained stable. After experimentation, the mice were anes-
thetized with 100% CO2 and decapitated. The brain was dissected and examined at the injection
site and for the presence of any intracranial hemorrhage. Three of 28 animals had visible intracranial
bleeding and were excluded from analysis.
Brainstem organotypic culture
P3 mice pups were used for the establishment of brainstem organotypic slice cultures. The pups
were decapitated at the cervical C3–C4 level. The heads were washed with cold dissection medium
consisting of 55% Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK), 0.3% glucose
(Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), 1% HEPES buffer (Invitrogen, UK) and 1% Antibiotic-Antimy-
cotic (Invitrogen, UK). After washing, the heads were moved to fresh dissection medium on ice. The
entire brain was dissected. During dissection, extra caution was taken around the cerebellopontine
angle to ensure that the respiratory regions of the brainstem were not damaged. Nerves were cut
with microscissors.
The brain was sectioned into 300-mm-thick transverse slices by using a McIlwain Tissue Chopper
(Ted Pella, Inc., Redding, CA, USA). Slices were selected by using anatomical landmarks, such as the
shape and size of the entire slice and the fourth ventricle. For location of the preBo
¨ tzinger complex
(preBo
¨ tC), the presence of nucleus hypoglossus, nucleus spinalis nervi trigemini, pyramis medullae
oblongatae and nucleus tractus solitarius (not always clearly seen), together with the absence of the
anterior horn for the nucleus cochlearis, according to online references (Ruangkittisakul et al.,
2006, 2011, 2014). For location of the parafacial respiratory group/retrotrapezoid nucleus (pFRG/
RTN), the presence of the nucleus facialis was used. On the slices, the preBo
¨ tC is located within ven-
trolateral regions, and the pFRG/RTN is located at the ventrolateral edge.
Selected slices were washed by moving them to brain slice medium (55% Dulbecco’s modified
Eagle’s medium, 32.5% Hank’s balanced salt solution, 0.3% glucose, 10% fetal bovine serum, 1%
HEPES buffer and 1% Antibiotic-Antimycotic [Invitrogen, UK]), after which they were carefully
placed on insert membranes (Millicell Culture Plate Inserts; Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) in six-
well plates. The membranes were coated in advance with poly-L-lysine (0.3 ml; 0.1 mg/ml, Sigma-
Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). Brain slice medium (1 ml) was placed underneath the membrane,
and all fluid on top of the membrane was removed. It is important not to cover the slices with
medium, because this may impair oxygenation (Frantseva et al., 1999). The brainstem slice cul-
tures were maintained in an incubator (37˚C, 5% CO2), and the brain slice medium was changed
every second day. The brainstem slices were kept in culture for 7–21 days in vitro (DIV) before
fixation or live imaging experiments. For a detailed protocol, see Herlenius and colleagues
(Herlenius et al., 2012).

 Immunohistochemistry
For immunohistochemistry, brainstem slice cultures were fixed with cold paraformaldehyde (4%) in
PBS for 1 hr at 4˚C and 20% ice-cold methanol in PBS for 10 min. Permeabilization was conducted
by using 0.2% Triton X-100 (Roche Diagnostics, Hofgeismar, Germany) and 0.1% Tween 20 (Invitro-
gen, UK) in PBS for 40 min at room temperature (RT). Thereafter, slices were blocked in 5% bovine
serum albumin (BSA; Invitrogen, UK) and 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS for 2 hr at RT. The Millicell insert
membranes were carefully cut with a scalpel and placed back into the wells. The primary antibodies
were diluted 1:200 in 0.05% Tween 20/PBS and incubated at 4˚C for 48 hr. Next, the slices were
washed 3 � 10 min with PBS and incubated for 1.5 hr at RT with Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary
antibodies (Invitrogen, UK) diluted 1:200 in 0.05% Tween 20/PBS. The slices were then washed 3 �
10 min with PBS and mounted in ProLong Gold Antifade Reagent with DAPI (Invitrogen, UK, cat. no.
P36931). Primary antibodies used were mouse anti-microtubule associated protein 2 (MAP2; Invitro-
gen, cat. no. P11137), rabbit anti-neurokinin 1 receptor (NK1R; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA,
cat no. S8305), mouse anti-GFAP (Chemicon, Temecula, CA, USA, cat no. MAB360), rabbit anti-
S100b (Millipore; cat. no. 04–1054), mouse anti-neuron-specific class III b-tubulin (Tuj1; Covance,
Princeton, NJ, USA, cat no. MMS-435P), rabbit anti-K+/Cl� cotransporter 2 (KCC2; Millipore, cat no.
07–432), rabbit anti-vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGLUT2; Synaptic Systems, Goettingen, Ger-
many, cat no. 135–402), mouse anti-connexin 26 (Cx26; Invitrogen, Inc., San Francisco, CA, cat no.
13–8100), rabbit anti-connexin 32 (Cx32; Invitrogen, cat. no. 71–0600), mouse anti-connexin 43
(Cx43; Zymed, cat no 13–8300), goat anti-Phox2b (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA,
cat no 13224), goat Phox2b antibody (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA), and rabbit anti-cas-
pase 3 (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA, USA, cat no. 9661). Negative controls with only sec-
ondary antibodies showed no staining.
For EP3R staining, a different protocol was used. Initially, brains were fixed with 4% paraformal-
dehyde overnight followed by 10% sucrose overnight and then frozen to -80%. The frozen brain-
stems were cryosectioned and blocked in blocking buffer (1% BSA, 5% donkey serum, 5% dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO), 1% Triton X-100 in Tris-buffered saline (TBS, consisting of 6 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM
Tris base and 9 mM NaCl in ddH2O) for 1 hr at RT. After blocking, the slices were incubated with
polyclonal rabbit anti-EP3R antibody (Cayman Chemical Co., Ann Arbor, MI, USA) diluted 1:50 in
10% DMSO containing 0.2% Triton X-100 in TBS at RT overnight. Next, slices were washed 3 �
15 min with TBS with agitation, followed by incubation for 1 hr in the dark with Alexa Fluor 488-con-
jugated donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA) diluted
1:1000 in 1% BSA, 2% donkey serum, 2% DMSO and 5% Triton X-100 in TBS. The slices were then
washed 3 � 15 min with TBS with agitation, and blocked again for 1 hr at RT in the same blocking
buffer as used previously. After blocking, the slices were incubated with the second primary anti-
body, diluted 1:200 in 10% DMSO containing 0.2% Triton X-100 in TBS at 4˚C overnight. Following
overnight incubation, the slices were washed 3 � 15 min with TBS with agitation and incubated with
Alexa Flour 647-conjugated donkey anti-goat secondary antibody (Life Technologies, Grand Island,
NY, USA) diluted 1:1000 in 1% BSA, 2% donkey serum, 2% DMSO and 5% Triton X-100 in TBS.
Finally, the slices were washed 3 � 15 min with TBS with agitation, and mounted in ProLong Gold
Antifade Reagent with DAPI.
Antibody binding was controlled by including an irrelevant rabbit polyclonal IgG isotype control
(Bioss, Woburn, MA, USA). EP3R staining was controlled by including an EP3R blocking peptide
reconstituted in distilled water mixed with EP3R antibody at a 1:1 (v/v) ratio. A pre-incubation of
EP3R antibody with the blocking peptide for 1 hr at RT was necessary before the antibody was
added to the slice. The peptide was used in conjunction with the antibody to block protein-antibody
complex formation during immunohistochemical analysis for the EP3Rs. These controls showed no
staining.
Double immunofluorescence staining was also performed according to Westman and colleagues
(Westman et al., 2004) using polyclonal rabbit anti-human microsomal prostaglandin E synthase 1
antiserum (mPGES-1; Cayman chemicals, cat. no. 160140) and monoclonal anti-mouse glial fibrillary
acidic protein antibody (GFAP; Chemicon, Temecula, CA, USA, cat no. MAB360). PBS supplemented
with 0.1% saponin (PBS-saponin) was used as a buffer through the experiment. Endogenous peroxi-
dase activity was blocked using PBS containing 1% H2O2 and 0.1% saponin for 60 min in darkness.

 Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) supplemented with 0.1% saponin. The sections were incubated with
primary antibodies overnight, in PBS-saponin containing 3% BSA antibody solution. Thereafter, they
were blocked with 1% normal goat serum, or normal donkey serum (depending on the host of sec-
ondary antibody) in PBS-saponin for 15 min, followed by 1-hr incubation with secondary antibody,
donkey anti-rabbit alexa fluorophore 488 or goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 546.
Propidium iodide staining
Propidium iodide (1 ml/L, Invitrogen, UK) was added to brain slice medium (dilution 1:1000). Stain-
ing solution (1 ml) was added on top of the membrane with the brainstem slice cultures and incu-
bated at 37˚C (5% CO2) for 3 hr. Immediately after incubation, the brainstem slice cultures were
fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 1 hr. Positive controls were made by first treating the brainstem
slice culture for oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) for 1 h, as described by Montero Dominguez and
colleagues (Montero Domı
´nguez et al., 2009).
Electrophysiology
Whole-cell patch recordings were obtained from brainstem slice cultures at a temperature of 34˚C.
Cells were visualized by using IR-differential contrast microscopy (Axioskop FS, Carl Zeiss, Jena, Ger-
many). Recorded cells were selected visually, and paired recordings were obtained for neurons with
lateral somatic distances of <100 mm. Recordings were amplified by using 700B amplifiers (Molecular
Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA), filtered at 2 kHz, digitized at 5–20 kHz by using ITC-18 (Instrutech,
Longmont, CO, USA), and acquired by using Igor Pro (Wavemetrics, Lake Oswego, OR, USA). Patch
pipettes were pulled with a P-97 Flamming/Brown micropipette puller (Sutter Instruments, Novato,
CA, USA) and had an initial resistance of 5–10 MW in a solution containing in mM: 110 K-gluconate,
10 KCl, 10 HEPES, 4 Mg-ATP, 0.3 GTP and 10 phosphocreatine. Recordings were performed in cur-
rent-clamp mode, with access resistance compensated throughout the experiments. Recordings
were discarded when access resistance increased beyond 35 MW. To characterize the electrical prop-
erties of the recorded cells, depolarizing and hyperpolarizing current steps and ramps were injected,
enabling the extraction of properties such as input resistance, membrane time constant and action
potential threshold. Electrophysiological properties were presented as box plots, with maximum and
minimum values.
For recording of hypoglossal nerve activity and hypoglossal nucleus neuronal population dis-
charge, an extracellular suction electrode was used together with a Model 1700 AC amplifier (A-M
systems, Carlsborg, WA, USA) and AxoScope software, version 9.2 (Axon Instruments, Union City,
CA, USA). Recordings were made with a sampling interval of 0.3 ms.
Ca2+ time-lapse imaging
For Ca2+ imaging, Fluo-4 AM (Invitrogen, UK) dissolved in DMSO (Invitrogen, UK) was used at 10
mM in serum free brain slice medium or artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF, containing in mM: 150.1
Na+, 3 K+, 2 Ca2+, 2 Mg2+, 135 Cl�, 1.1 H2PO4
�, 25 HCO3
- and 10 glucose) together with 0.02%
pluronic acid (Invitrogen, UK). We did not observe any differences in Ca2+activity between HEPES-
free brain slice medium and aCSF during Ca2+imaging, despite slight differences in [K+] and [Ca2+],
which both affect the rhythm of the slice (Ballanyi and Ruangkittisakul, 2009). A higher [Ca2+] or an
increase in [K+] from 3 mM to 4.8 mM did not affect the network properties in our system. To local-
ize the preBo
¨ tC or the pFRG/RTN, tetramethylrhodamine-conjugated Substance P (TMR-SP; Biomol,
Oakdale, NY, USA) was used at a final concentration of 3 mM in brain slice medium or aCSF. The
TMR-SP solution was placed on top on the brainstem slice and incubated for 10–12 min at 37˚C in
an atmosphere of 5% CO2. The TMR-SP solution was then replaced with 1 ml of 10 mM Fluo-4 solu-
tion. The Fluo-4 solution was incubated for 30–40 min (37˚C, 5% CO2). Before imaging, the slice was
washed with brain slice medium/aCSF for 10 min (37˚C, 5% CO2).
During time-lapse imaging, slices were kept in an open chamber perfused with HEPES-free brain
slice medium (containing in mM: 132 Na+, 4.8 K+, 1.4 Ca2+, 0.74 Mg2+, 112 Cl-, 0.76 H2PO4
-, 25.6

- and 16.8 glucose) or aCSF (2.5 ml/min) by using a peristaltic pump. A Chamlide Inline Heater
(Live Cell instruments, Seoul, Korea, cat no. IL-H-10) was used for temperature control, and a Cham-
lide AC-PU perfusion chamber for 25-mm coverslips (Live Cell instruments, Seoul, Korea, cat no.
ACPU25) was used for perfusion. HEPES-free medium was used to minimize the risk for hydrogen

 peroxide formation (Lepe-Zuniga and Gery, 1987). The medium or aCSF was constantly bubbled
with 5% CO2 and 95% O2. The temperature of the chamber was set to 32˚C, which Hartelt and col-
leagues (Hartelt et al., 2008) showed to be well tolerated by neurons. Images were captured by
using a Zeiss AxioExaminer D1 microscope equipped with 20� and 40� water immersion objectives
(N.A. 1.0), a monochromatic Zeiss MrM CCD-camera, a Photometrics eVolve EMCCD-camera and fil-
ter sets 38HE (Zeiss), 43 (Zeiss), and et560/hq605 (Chroma, Bellows Falls, VT, USA). For live imaging,
a frame interval of 0.1–2 s was used. Exposure time was set to 100–300 ms.
Substances added during imaging were [D-Ala2, N-Me-Phe4, Gly5-ol]-enkephalin (DAMGO, 0.5
mM; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA, cat no. E7384), carbenoxolone (CBX 50, mM; Sigma-Aldrich,
St. Louis, MO, USA, cat no. C4790), 18a-glycyrrhetinic acid (18-a-GA, 25 mM; Sigma-Aldrich, St.
Louis, MO, USA, cat no. G10105), glycyrrhizic acid (GZA, 50 mM; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA,
cat no. 50531), tetrodotoxin (TTX, 20 nM, Abcam, Cambridge, UK, cat.no. 120055), riluzole (10 mM,
Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA, cat.no. R116), flufenamic acid (FFA, 50 mM, Sigma-Aldrich, St.
Louis, MO, USA, cat.no. F9005), Suramin (100 mM; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA, cat no.
S2671), TNP-ATP (20 nM; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA, cat. no. SML0740), AH6809 (Cayman
Chemicals, cat.no. 33458-93-4) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2, 10 nM; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO,
USA, cat no. P5640). All substances were dissolved in brain slice medium/aCSF prior to experimenta-
tion and added to the chamber by using a continuous flow system. For each experiment, a control
period with regular medium/aCSF was followed by drug application. GZA was used as a negative
control for the gap junction inhibitors CBX and 18a-GA because it has non-gap junction-inhibiting
properties, but similar side effects to those of CBX. Specificity was tested by using a second batch
of medium or aCSF. During infections in neonatal children, PGE2 is present at a concentration of 15
pM in cerebrospinal fluid (Hofstetter et al., 2007). A higher concentration (10 nM) was used to
compensate for the in vivo metabolism of the molecule.
Exposure to isohydric hypercapnia was done by using aCSF adjusted with a high bicarbonate
buffer concentration (in mM: 150.1 Na+, 3 K+, 2 Ca2+, 2 Mg2+, 111 Cl�, 1.1 H2PO4
�, 50 HCO3
� and
10 glucose). This generated a hypercapnic carbon dioxide partial pressure (pCO2) of 6.6 kPa at pH
7.5 when aCSF was saturated with 8% CO2.
Viral transfection and optogenetics
A subgroup of 1-DIV-old brainstem slices were moved to a separate BSL-2 laboratory where they
were transduced with a mouse prostaglandin E receptor 3 (subtype EP3) lentivirus (Ptger3) contain-
ing Halo57, developed in collaboration with Dr Robert Finney (Xactagen, Shoreline, WA, USA), by
applying 0.2 ml of virus suspension on top of the slice. The brainstem slice cultures were then placed
in an incubator for 5 days, and after washing with warm brain slice medium at time points 2 and 5
days, the brainstem slice cultures were moved back to the original laboratory and placed in an incu-
bator overnight. Ca2+ time-lapse imaging was performed on the slices as described above. Halo57
was stimulated continuously during Ca2+ time-lapse imaging by using a 625-nm LED in a custom-
built system (Thorlabs, Newton, NJ, USA).
The optogenetically inhibited network and NK1R positive neurons retained their response to gen-
eral depolarization induced by elevated [K+] (Supplementary Fig. S6).
PGE2 ELISA
The release of PGE2 in aCSF during control and hypercapnic conditions was assessed by ELISA. The
aCSF samples were collected through perfusion system, during control and hypercapnic period and
either analyzed immediately or stored at -80˚C. For the validation of the experiments, two different
ELISA kits have been used.
Prostaglandin E2 EIA monoclonal kit by Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI, US) was performed
according to standard procedure. Firstly, the PGE2 EIA Standard was prepared from #1 to #8. The
96-well plate was ready to use and contained a minimum of two blanks (Blk), two non-specific bind-
ing wells (NSB), two maximum binding wells (B0) and an eight point standard curve run in duplicate.
Each sample was assayed in triplicate. The 96-well plate was coated for 18 hr at 4˚C with 50 ml of
Prostaglandin E2 AChE Tracer and 50 ml of Prostaglandin E2 Monoclonal Antibody per well. Plate
was washed three times with specific Wash Buffer and in consequence, it was developed in the dark

 at room temperature on a plate shaker for 60–90 min by adding 200 ml of Ellman’s Reagent to each
well. Finally, the plate was read at 405 nm.
PGE2 ELISA kit by Enzo Life Sciences (Farmdale, NY, US) was also used for the confirmation
of the results. A similar process was followed but a bit shorter. Samples were assayed in dupli-
cate. The 96-well plate was incubated at room temperature on a plate shaker for 2 hr with 50 ml
of PGE2 conjugate and 50 ml of antibody solution per well. Then, the plate was washed three
times with washing solution. After the wash, 200 ml of the pNpp substrate solution were added
to every well and the plate was incubated at room temperature for 45 min. Finally, 50 ml of Stop
Solution were added to every well in order to stop the reaction and the plate was read immedi-
ately at 405 nm.
Quantitative real-time PCR
The preBo
¨ tC and pFRG/RTN regions were cut out from brainstem slices with micro scissors. The
samples were pooled together litterwise to minimize the effect of different tissue piece sizes, and
provide enough cells for accurate analysis. RNA was isolated from the tissue samples using the miR-
CURY RNA isolation Kit (Exiqon) according to manufacturer’s instructions. cDNA was synthesized
from 20 ng RNA using SuperScript VILO cDNA Synthesis Kit (Invitrogen). The reverse transcription
was performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Real-time PCR was run with Power SYBR
Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) and amplified in a 7500 Real Time PCR system (Applied
Biosystems). Primers are listed in Table 8. As endogenous control, glucose-3 phosphate dehydroge-
nase (GAPDH; Applied Biosystems) was used. Relative quantification (RQ) values were calculated
using the CT(DDCT) method (Livak and Schmittgen, 2001).
Data analysis
From in vivo plethysmograph recording (LabChart Pro, v 8.0.10, AD Instruments, Dunedin, New Zea-
land), periods of calm respiration without movement artifacts were selected for analysis based upon
visual observations during experimentation as in previous studies (Hofstetter and Herlenius, 2005).
Mean respiratory frequency (FR; breaths/min), tidal volume (VT) and minute ventilation (VE) during
normocapnic and hypercapnic periods were calculated as described previously (Hofstetter and Her-
lenius, 2005). Sighs were excluded from the analysis. VT and VE were divided by body weight (BW)
and expressed as milliliters per gram and milliliters per gram per min, respectively. The number of
sighs, defined as breath with larger amplitude and a biphasic inspiratory phase, was calculated man-
ually and expressed as sighs per min.
Immunohistochemical staining was analyzed in a Zeiss AxioExaminer D1 microscope (10�, 20�
and 40� water immersion objectives) or a Zeiss LSM700 confocal (40� and 63� oil-immersion
objectives), and captured images were processed by adjusting contrast in ImageJ (1.42q,
National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA) to reduce background staining.
Ca2+ imaging time traces were analyzed with a recently published method (Malmersjo et al.,
2013; Smedler et al., 2014). Regions of interest were marked for all cells based on the standard
deviation of fluorescence intensity over time, by using a semiautomatic-adapted ImageJ script
kindly provided by Dr. John Hayes (The College of William and Mary, Williamsburg, VA,
USA, http://physimage.sourceforge.net/). The mean intensity value and coordinates were measured
using ImageJ. Average intensities of regions of interest were quantified for each frame, and
dynamic fluorescence signals were normalized to baseline values. The linear similarity (Pearson

 correlation) was calculated (Figure 4—figure supplement 1) between pairs of Ca2+ traces with a
custom-made script in MATLAB (version 7.9.0.529 R2009b; MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA) and by
using the mic2net toolbox (Smedler et al., 2014) (version 6.12; MathWorks). Calculating the pair-
wise correlation coefficients resulted in a correlation matrix that was converted to an adjacency
matrix by applying a cut-off level. The cut-off level was selected by calculating the mean of the
99th percentile of correlation coefficients for a set of experiments with scrambled signals. Scram-
bling was performed by randomly translating all traces in the time-domain. The network structure
was visualized by plotting a line between pairs of cells, where the color of the lines was propor-
tionate to the correlation coefficient. This was plotted on top of an image of the standard devia-
tions of the fluorescence over time per pixel. Connectivity was defined as the number of cell pairs
with a correlation coefficient larger than the cut-off value divided by the total number of the pairs
of cells. This provided a measure of the degree of connections within a network. Small-world
parameter, mean shortest path length (l) and mean clustering coefficient (s) were calculated by
using the MATLAB BGL library (http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/10922) and
compared to corresponding randomized networks. Many biological networks have a small-world
structure, where the mean shortest path length is as short as in random networks and the mean
clustering coefficient is higher. This signifies that the average number of nodes (for example, neu-
ral cells) that a signal has to pass is low, and that many of the nodes are connected in clusters
(Watts and Strogatz, 1998). A small-world network structure creates the possibilities of regional
specialization and efficient signal transfer, and is a common organization of networks within the
brain (Telesford et al., 2011).
Data were further processed to produce graphs in OriginPro, version 9.1 (OriginLab Corporation,
Northamptom, MA, USA). Time-lapse Ca2+ imaging time traces were normalized individually
through DF/F0, where DF=F1�F0. F1 is the specific fluorescence intensity at a specific time point, and
F0 is the average intensity of 30 s before and after F1.

Statistics
Statistical analysis of paired comparisons was performed by Student’s t-test. Full factorial two-way
ANOVA was performed when there was more than one independent variable or multiple observa-
tions. Both tests were two-sided. The compared data was of equal variance and normally distrib-
uted. All calculations for the statistical tests were conducted with JMP (v 11.1., SAS Institute Inc.,

 Cary, NC, US). In all cases, p<0.05 was considered statistically significant. Data are presented as
means ± SD. All data sets were compared less than 20 times, which is why no statistical correc-
tions were made. As these experiments were expended to provide new descriptive data, no
explicit power analysis was performed. Instead sample sizes similar to previous publications with
similar methods were used. Details on the statistics are presented in Tables 9 and 10.
