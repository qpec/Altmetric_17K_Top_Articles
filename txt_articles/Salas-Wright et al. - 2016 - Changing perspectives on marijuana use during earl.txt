Abstract 
 
 
Introduction.  Prior research has often overlooked potential cohort differences in marijuana 
views and use across adolescence and young adulthood. To begin to address this gap, we conduct 
an exploratory examination of marijuana views and use among American youth using a panel of 
cross-sectional surveys. Method. Findings are based on repeated, cross-sectional data collected 
annually from adolescents (ages 12-17; n = 230,452) and young adults (ages 18-21; n = 120,588) 
surveyed as part of the National Survey on Drug Use and Health between 2002 and 2014. For 
each of the birth years between 1986 and 1996, we combined a series of nationally representative 
cross-sections to provide multi-year data strings designed to approximate nationally 
representative cohorts. Results. Compared to youth born in the mid-to-late 1980s, youth born in 
the mid-1990s reported significantly higher levels of marijuana disapproval during the early 
adolescent years (Age 14: 1988 = 64.7%, 1994 = 70.4%) but lower levels of disapproval during 
the young adult years (Age 19: 1988 = 32.0%, 1994 = 25.0%; Age 20: 1988 = 27.9%, 1994 = 
19.7%). Moreover, the prevalence of marijuana use among youth born in 1994 was significantly 
lower—compared to youth born in 1988—at age 14 (1988: 11.39%, 1994: 8.19%) and 
significantly higher at age 18 (1988: 29.67%, 1994: 34.83%). This pattern held even when 
adjusting for potential confounding by demographic changes in the population across the study 
period. Conclusions. We see evidence of changes in the perceptions of marijuana use among 
youth born during the late twentieth century.

Recent years have witnessed tremendous change with respect to the perception and 
distribution of marijuana in the United States (US). In 1996, California became the first state to 
legalize the use of medical marijuana and, shortly thereafter, calls were made by The New 
England Journal of Medicine and the National Institutes of Health for research to reassess the 
classification of marijuana as a Schedule I drug (Kassirer, 1997; Volker, 1997). By 2008, more 
than a dozen states had legalized the use of marijuana for specific medical conditions and voters 
in Massachusetts approved an initiative to decriminalize the possession of small amounts of 
marijuana (Lee, 2012). At present, twenty-five states and the District of Columbia have medical 
marijuana laws, recreational marijuana use is legal in several states, and more than half of all 
American adults support legalization (Motel, 2015).  
 
A bevy of recent studies have examined changes in the use and perception of marijuana 
among youth in the US. Trend studies conducted using data from the National Youth Risk 
Behavior Survey (YRBS), National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), and Monitoring 
the Future (MTF) point to noteworthy changes in marijuana use among adolescents and young 
adults over the past few decades (Hasin et al., 2015; Johnson et al., 2015; Johnston, O’Malley, 
Miech, Bachman, & Schulenberg, 2015; Salas-Wright, Vaughn, Todic, Córdova, & Perron, 
2015; Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration [SAHMSA], 2014). For 
instance, evidence from the NSDUH and MTF point to decreases in marijuana use among 
adolescents along with modest but significant increases in use and substantial decreases in 
disapproval among young adults (Johnston et al., 2015; Salas-Wright et al., 2015). 
 
One important shortcoming, however, faced by all the aforementioned trend studies is a 
failure to account for cohort differences. For instance, Salas-Wright and colleagues (2015) 
provide a fine-grained assessment of trends in marijuana use and disapproval among 
 4 
 
developmental subgroups (i.e., ages 12-14, 15-17, 18-25). While such an assessment provides 
insight into changes in prevalence among youth in particular developmental subsets, this 
approach overlooks the ways in which youth from particular cohorts may differ across the 
spectrum of adolescence and young adulthood (Keyes et al., 2011). Indeed, given the speed at 
which changes in marijuana policy have occurred—particularly during the latter half of the 
2000s—it is reasonable to surmise that children who entered adolescence, for example, in the 
1990s may be distinct from those who became teenagers in the mid-2000s.  
The Present Study 
  
Our objective is to extend findings from recent trend studies by examining the 
disapproval and use of marijuana using a panel of cross-sectional surveys. Specifically, we 
construct a series of analytic samples designed to approximate nationally representative cohorts 
of American youth from early adolescence to young adulthood. Notably, while our approach 
allows us examine marijuana-related trends using strings of data that are analogous to cohorts, 
we should be very clear that it is not possible to examine true cohorts using NSDUH data. 
Cognizant of this limitation, we conduct an exploratory study designed to examine changes in 
the prevalence of marijuana disapproval and use among American youth born between the mid-
1980s and the mid-1990s.  
Method 
Sample and Procedures 
Study findings are based on repeated, cross-sectional data collected annually as part of 
the NSDUH between 2002 and 2014. Each year the NSDUH provides estimates of substance use 
in the civilian, non-institutionalized population of the US on the basis of a new, non-overlapping 
national sample. Since 2002, a total of 723,283 respondents (including 230,452 adolescents and 
 5 
 
120,588 young adults) have completed the NSDUH survey. The NSDUH design/methods are 
summarized briefly here; however, a detailed description of the study procedures is available 
elsewhere (SAHMSA, 2014). 
Repeated, Cross-Sectional Data Constructed as Panels 
In order to examine the changes from early adolescence to young adulthood among youth 
born in varying birth years (e.g., 1986, 1987, etc.,), we utilized the “mutoscope” approach to 
analyzing repeated, cross-sectional data constructed as a panel (Frost, 1939; Seedall & Anthony, 
2015). Specifically, for each of the birth years between 1986 and 1996, we combined a series of 
population-based cross-sections of youth to provide multi-year strings of data that approximate 
nationally representative cohorts (based on respondent age/survey year). For instance, for the 
1994 data string, we began with a nationally representative sample of 12-year-olds in 2002 and, 
with each subsequent year, selected a refreshed and non-overlapping subsample of youth that 
corresponded in age to the original nationally representative sample from 2002 (e.g., 13-year-
olds in 2003, 14-year-olds in 2004, and so on up to 20-years-olds in 2014). This approach is 
similar to that used in producing instruments such as pediatric growth charts (which are also 
based on a series of cross-sectional snapshots; Grummer-Strawn et al., 2010).  
Measures  
Marijuana use disapproval. Adolescents (ages 12-17) and young adults (ages 18-21) 
were queried about their views on marijuana use using two similarly-phrased questions. 
Adolescents were asked: “How do you feel about someone your age trying marijuana or hashish 
once or twice?” and young adults were asked “How do you feel about adults trying marijuana or 
hashish once or twice?”  Youth reporting that they "strongly disapprove" were coded as 1 while 
 6 
 
youth reporting more lenient views (“neither approve nor disapprove" or "somewhat 
disapprove") were coded as 0.  
Marijuana use. Past 12-month marijuana use (0 = no, 1 = yes) was assessed by first 
asking participants, “Have you used marijuana or hashish during the past 12 months?”   
 
Sociodemographic Factors.  Sociodemographic variables include: gender (female, 
male), race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic white, African-American, Hispanic, Other), and total annual 
family income (less than $20,000; $20,000 to $49,999; $50,000 to $74,999; $75,000 or more).       
Statistical Analyses  
 First, we analyze and report the prevalence estimates and corresponding 95% confidence 
intervals for marijuana disapproval and past year marijuana use among youth from varying birth 
years (i.e.,1986-1996) from early adolescence to young adulthood (i.e., ages 12-21). As is 
standard with NSDUH data, all prevalence estimates and 95% confidence intervals were adjusted 
for complex survey sampling design effects using Stata 14.1 MP software. However, in order to 
account for potential demographic shifts over the period of the study, we also computed 
prevalence estimates and confidence intervals that were adjusted for year-by-year data on 
gender, race/ethnicity, and family income among survey respondents. Although we present 
information for youth from all birth years between 1986 and 1996, we primarily emphasize the 
strings of data for youth born in 1988 and 1994. These birth years provided the optimal 
combination of spacing in years (i.e., a multi-year gap between each of the birth years) and 
inclusion of multiple ages (i.e., maximum coverage of ages 12-21).  
Results 
Marijuana Disapproval and Use  
 7 
 
 
Marijuana Disapproval. Among all birth years/strings of data, we observed a clear 
reduction in the proportion of youth reporting “strong disapproval” of marijuana use as youth 
progressed from the early adolescent to young adult stage (see Table 1). However, closer 
inspection reveals important differences between youth born in 1988 and those born in 1994 (see 
Figure 1). Specifically, we see a pattern in which youth born in 1994 report significantly greater 
disapproval at age 14 (70.39, 95% CI = 67.9-72.8) as compared to youth born in 1988 at the 
same age (64.73, 95% CI = 62.4-66.3). Similar findings can be found by contrasting youth born 
in 1989 and 1995 during early adolescence (i.e. ages 13-14). However, during young adulthood 
we see that youth born in 1994 report significantly lower levels of disapproval at age 19 (1988: 
32.00, 95% CI =29.7-34.4; 1994: 24.99, 95% CI = 22.9-27.2) and 20 (1988: 27.93, 95% CI = 
25.2-30.8; 1994: 19.69, 95% CI = 17.2-22.4) compared to youth born in 1988. We also observed 
non-overlapping conference intervals in contrasting data strings from 1986-1987 with those from 
1995-1996 at ages 18-19. Notably, this pattern held even when adjusting for potential 
confounding by demographic changes in the population across the study period. 
 
Marijuana Use. We conducted a similar analysis of marijuana use (available upon 
request). Among all birth year strings, we observed a steady increase in the prevalence of past 
year marijuana use from age 12 to age 18 before leveling off during the young adult stage (i.e., 
ages 18-21). Similar to marijuana disapproval, we found that point estimates for marijuana use 
were, compared to youth born in 1988, lower among youth born in 1994 from ages 14 to 16, but 
then higher from ages 17 to 20. Adjusting for sociodemographic changes, these differences were 
significant at age 14 (1988: 11.39, 95% CI = 9.90-12.89; 1994: 8.19, 95% CI = 6.86-9.53) and 18 
(1988: 29.67, 95% CI = 27.61-31.73; 1994:34.83, 95% CI = 32.12-37.55).

Link between Marijuana Disapproval and Use  
 
We conducted supplementary analyses to examine the cross-sectional association 
between marijuana disapproval and use among youth born in 1988 and 1994 (available upon 
request). Results revealed that the link between marijuana disapproval and use was consistently 
robust across the developmental spectrum of early adolescence and young adulthood for youth in 
all data strings. Specifically, with the exception of 12-year-olds born in 1994 (OR = 0.30, 95% 
CI = 0.07-1.26), the association between disapproval and use was uniformly significant with 
odds ratios tightly clustered between 0.08 and 0.14.  
Discussion 
 
We found that youth born in the mid-1990s—that is, those entering the teenage years in 
the latter half of the 2000s—appear to be distinct from those born in the mid-to-late 1980s with 
respect to the disapproval of marijuana use. In particular, we saw a pattern in which youth from 
earlier birth years reported relatively greater disapproval during early-to-mid adolescence in 
combination with increasingly lower disapproval during young adulthood.  
This curious pattern of results begs the question: What may be influencing observed birth 
year differences in marijuana disapproval? One possibility is that incipient changes in marijuana 
policy taking place in the late 1990s / early 2000s—that is, efforts to medicalize and 
decriminalize marijuana in parts of the US—may have prompted parents and preventionists to be 
more proactive in educating young teens about the dangers of adolescent marijuana use (which 
had an effect during early adolescence that later “wore off” by young adulthood). It is also 
possible that, as the legal consequences of marijuana use have begun to change in many parts of 
the US, the later cohorts may have been differentially influenced (thereby reporting lower 
disapproval and more use during the emerging adult stage). Second, our findings seem to reflect 
 9 
 
changes in the general population in the US (Hasin et al., 2015, 2016) as marijuana has become 
increasingly available in a legal and/or decriminalized form and approval for legalization has 
steadily increased (Salas-Wright & Vaughn, 2016a, 2016b).  
While we observed birth year differences with respect to the perception of marijuana 
across the development spectrum, the prevalence of strong marijuana disapproval and marijuana 
use effectively mirror one another among youth from earlier and later birth years. Indeed, our 
analyses suggest a very consistent and robust relationship between disapproval and marijuana 
use across birth years and with age. This is noteworthy as results from the present study suggest 
invariance in the disapproval/marijuana use link across birth year data strings. 
 
Several study limitations should be noted. First, the NSDUH data are cross-sectional. We 
constructed samples based on repeated cross-sections of data designed only to approximate 
longitudinal cohorts of youth. Such data do not allow us to assess within-person change or 
examine the prospective relationship between marijuana disapproval and use. Moreover, while 
we adjusted for sociodemographic factors across the study period, the NSDUH data are 
potentially vulnerable to year-to-year sociodemographic changes. For instance, it is possible that 
mean values for youth born in the same year may be different in a given survey year due to 
changes in the makeup of the sample rather than actual changes in views/use. Despite these 
limitations, exploratory findings suggest that changes in marijuana policy and public perception 
may be impacting the marijuana-related trajectories of youth coming-of-age in the early 2000s. 
We encourage researchers to build upon the present study by examining and deepening our 
understanding of potential cohort differences in marijuana use among American youth.

Note:  
Standard and adjusted estimates in bold represent significant differences between the 1988 and 1994 cohorts. Standard estimates are adjusted for the complex sampling design only. Estimates 
specified as "adjusted" were calculated to account for [1] the complex sampling design of the National Survey on Drug Use and Health and [2] potential year-to-year differences in key 
sociodemographic factors (i.e., gender, race/at the city, and family income).
