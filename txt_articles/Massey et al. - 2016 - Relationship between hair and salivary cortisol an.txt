Abstract 
Evidence for an association between cortisol and clinical pregnancy in women 
undergoing In Vitro Fertilisation (IVF) is mixed with previous studies relying 
exclusively on short term measures of cortisol in blood, saliva, urine, and/or 
follicular fluid. Hair sampling allows analysis of systemic levels of cortisol over 
the preceding 3-6 months. The present study sought to explore the relationship 
between cortisol and clinical pregnancy outcome in women undergoing IVF 
utilising multiple indices of cortisol derived from both saliva and hair measured 
prior to commencing gonadotrophin treatment. A total of 135 women (mean age 
34.5 SD +/-4.8) were recruited from an English fertility clinic (December 2012 to 
April 2014) 60% of whom became pregnant (n=81)). Salivary cortisol data were 
obtained over two days: upon awakening, 30 minutes post awakening, and at 
22:00. A subsample (n=88) of the women providing salivary samples were 
approached consecutively to provide hair samples for the measurement of

cortisol. Independent Logistic regression analyses revealed that salivary cortisol 
measures including cortisol awakening response (CAR) (p=.485), area under the 
curve with respect to ground (AUCg) (p=.527), area under the curve with respect 
to increase (AUCi) (p=.731) and diurnal slope (p=.889) did not predict clinical 
pregnancy. In contrast, hair cortisol concentrations significantly predicted clinical 
pregnancy (p=.017). Associations between hair cortisol and clinical pregnancy 
remained when controlling for accumulations of salivary cortisol (p=.034) 
accounting for 26.7% of the variance in pregnancy outcome. 
 These findings provide preliminary evidence that longer term systemic cortisol 
may influence reproductive outcomes; and in turn suggests that interventions to 
reduce cortisol prior to commencing IVF could improve treatment outcomes.

1. Introduction 
The role that stress may exert on reproductive functioning has remained a topic of 
debate for decades (Boivin and Venetis., 2011; Mathiesen et al., 2011). This 
debate has been fuelled not least by the complexities of delineating plausible 
psychobiological pathways by which stress might influence reproductive 
outcomes (Whirledge and Cidlowski, 2010; Toufexis et al., 2014). Two main 
pathways have been considered: the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) - 
hypothalamic pituitary gonadal (HPG) axis and the HPA â€“ immune axis.  The 
glucocorticoid cortisol, the main effector of the HPA axis, plays a central role in 
both pathways. With regard to the HPA-HPG pathway, elevated cortisol has been 
shown to inhibit sexual functions at all three levels of the HPG axis. At the level 
of the hypothalamus via inhibition of gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRh) 
secretion (Dubey and Plant, 1985; Kamel and Kubajak, 1987), at the level of the 
pituitary by interfering with GnRh induced luteinising hormone release (Briski 
and Sylvester, 1991), and at the level of the gonads by altering the stimulatory 
effect of gonadotrophins on sex steroid secretion (Bambino and Hsueh, 1981; 
Hsueh and Erikson, 1978). 
With regard to the HPA-immune pathway it is well established that cortisol can 
regulate the activity of the immune system (Tsigos and Chrousos, 2002), 
including effects on the production of proinflammatory cytokines, tumour 
necrosis factor (TNF) and natural killer (NK) cell activity (Gatti et al. 1987; 
Mavoungou, 2006) all of which have been implicated in reproductive outcomes 
(Daher et al. 1999). However, the precise role of the immune system in pregnancy 
continues to be an area of debate. Taking the early phases of pregnancy as an 
example, it has been suggested that because the fetus is semi-allogenic to the 
 Massey, A.J.

maternal host, that a degree of immune suppression may favour conception 
(Thornton, 2010; Nepomnaschy et al., 2007). In contrast, it has been argued that, 
rather than immune suppression, a strong inflammatory response is required for 
conception to occur (Mor, 2011). These competing views are likely to be due, in 
part, to the fact that as observed by Mor, (2011), pregnancy has often been 
conceptualised as a single immunological event. However, there is evidence that 
it consists of three distinct phases (characterised by a pro-inflammatory (first 
trimester), anti-inflammatory (second trimester) and then finally a return to a pro-
inflammatory state (third trimester). Furthermore, as noted by Christian (2015), 
even though the immune system is highly regulated by the neuroendocrine 
system, to date, there has been little integration of these literatures in the context 
of fertility and pregnancy: further impeding attempts to delineate the significance 
of the HPA-immune pathway.  
 
These contrasting views regarding the role of the immune system during 
conception are further complicated by the presence or absence of glucocorticoid 
resistance (GR). GR refers to the phenomenon whereby immune function fails to 
downregulate despite the presence of chronically elevated cortisol (Cohen et al., 
2012; Barnes and Adcock, 2009). Thus, two scenarios are possible. In the first, 
elevated cortisol results in immunosuppression (in the absence of GR). In the 
second, elevated cortisol (in the presence of GR) fails to down regulate 
inflammatory responses (Nepomnaschy et al., 2007 Thornton, 2010). These 
opposing effects of cortisol on immunity have fuelled the debate about the role of 
the immune system in fertility and specifically whether and when immune 
 Massey, A.J.

suppression, normal immune function or indeed heightened immune activity 
promotes or hinders reproductive outcomes.  
Given what is understood about the direct effects of the HPA-HPG axis on 
reproduction, and the proposed role that immunosuppression may or may not 
play, divergent effects on pregnancy outcomes could be expected in women 
undergoing infertility treatment. Considering, for example, just the period prior to 
commencing treatment, increased cortisol, from the perspective of the HPA-HPG 
(and potentially also the HPA-immune axis in the presence of GR and excessive 
inflammation) could be expected to be associated with decreased likelihood of 
pregnancy. In contrast, from the perspective of an HPA-immune pathway (in the 
absence of GR), advocates of the view that immune suppression favours 
conception (e.g., Thornton, 2010; Nepomnaschy et al., 2007) may expect greater 
levels of cortisol to be associated with an increased likelihood of pregnancy. 
These contrasting outcomes were evident in a recent systematic review which 
reported that both high and low cortisol levels were associated with an increased 
likelihood of pregnancy in women undergoing IVF treatment (Massey et al., 
2014). Twelve studies were identified that explored associations between cortisol 
(measured in blood, urine, saliva and follicular fluid) and establishment of clinical 
pregnancy. Three studies reported significant associations between elevated 
cortisol in follicular fluid and increased likelihood of clinical pregnancy 
(Andersen and Hornnes., 1994; Keay et al., 2002; Thurston et al., 2003). Four 
studies showed the opposite relationship albeit at different stages of treatment 
(Demytteneare et al., 1992; Micheal et al., 1999; An et al., 2011; An et al., 2013). 
The remaining five studies failed to find any significant associations between 
cortisol and pregnancy outcomes (Lovely et al., 2003; Lewicka et al., 2003; 
 Massey, A.J. 
 
6 
 
Smeenk et al., 2005; Nouri et al., 2011; Csemiczky et al., 2000). These equivocal 
findings are in contrast to evidence from animal studies which have shown a 
more consistent relationship between elevated cortisol levels and impaired 
reproductive outcomes across a range of species (Dobson and Smith, 1995; 
Alejandro et al., 2014).  
A number of methodological factors may have contributed to the findings in this 
review. First, the majority of studies failed to control for extraneous variables 
known to influence cortisol including time of day, caffeine consumption and body 
mass index (BMI) (Massey et al., 2014). Second, studies measured cortisol at 
different stages of treatment. Whilst IVF is a useful clinical model for exploring 
the effects of stress on reproductive outcomes, over half of the studies (7/12) 
measured cortisol following gonadotrophin administration (Andersen et al., 1994; 
Keay et al., 2002; Thurston et al., 2003; Micheal et al., 1999; Lovely et al., 2003; 
Lewicka et al., 2003; Nouri et al., 2011). Gonadotrophins have profound effects 
on the HPA axis and, therefore, are likely to have confounded any observed 
associations between HPA function and pregnancy. Third, studies relied 
exclusively on acute (saliva, blood) or short term (urine, follicular fluid) measures 
of cortisol. However, these measures are only able to provide information about 
cortisol levels over minutes (saliva/blood) to hours (urine/follicular fluid). At 
best, such measures may not accurately represent basal function or, at worst, may 
only capture transient levels of the hormone which are unlikely to influence 
health (Saxbe, 2008).   
A recent methodological development that may prove promising for 
understanding HPA function is hair sampling which provides a retrospective 
index of cumulative cortisol exposure over extended periods of 3 to 6 months 
 Massey, A.J. 
 
7 
 
(Gow et al., 2010). The validity and reliability of hair cortisol sampling has been 
supported in both animal (Davenport et al., 2006) and human studies (Sauve et 
al., 2007; Stalder and Kirschbaum, 2012). Furthermore, the utility of hair 
sampling as a marker of long term HPA function has been demonstrated in a 
range of health contexts (Yamada et al., 2007; Kalra et al., 2007; Dettenborn et 
al., 2011; Steudte et al., 2011; Pereg et al., 2011; Braig et al., 2015). 
The aim of this study was, therefore, to build upon previous work by exploring 
the relationship between acute (saliva) and chronic (hair) cortisol measured in the 
1-2 weeks prior to commencing IVF treatment and treatment outcomes, as 
measured by the absence/presence of a clinical pregnancy. In view of the 
continued uncertainty regarding the precise role of the HPA-immune pathway in 
reproductive outcomes, we hypothesised that, in support of the HPA-HPG 
pathway elevated levels of acute and chronic cortisol would be associated with a 
reduced likelihood of pregnancy.  
2. Materials and Methods 
2.1 Recruitment 
Recruitment took place at a single English fertility clinic between December 2012 
to April 2014. Non-smoking women, with a body mass index (BMI) of 19 to 35, 
undergoing a long GnRH agonist protocol were eligible for participation. Study 
exclusion criteria included subjects with any recognised endocrinological health 
conditions (Kudielka et al., 2009). Patients taking concurrent corticosteroids were 
excluded from recruitment. Eligible patients received information regarding the 
study along with their initial appointment letters. During their initial consultation 
patients were asked whether or not they were interested in taking part in the study.

Those patients who were interested either met the study coordinator to discuss the 
study immediately after the consultation, or received a phone call at a later date. 
Participation in the study was optional and patients were assured that their decision 
to participate or not would not affect the quality of care provided by the clinic. 
Patients received no money or added benefits for taking part. Interested patients 
were asked to return to the clinic within seven days of their initial consultation to 
complete a study consent form and to collect a study participation pack. All 
patients provided written informed consent and the study was granted ethical 
approval by the NHS Health Research Authority, NRES Yorkshire and Humber 
Leeds East committee (Research Ethics Committee Reference 12/YH/0463).  
 
 
Figure 1 summarises the participant recruitment in the study and number of 
patients providing cortisol data. Eight hundred patients were exposed to either a 
letter/study information leaflet, study poster and/or clinician/researcher invite. 
Two hundred and thirty-five patients expressed interest in the study. A total of 
one hundred and ninety patients were recruited. All patients were asked to collect 
saliva samples for the determination of salivary cortisol. After controlling for 
exclusions and missing data, complete data were available for n= 135 for the 
cortisol awakening response (CAR), area under the curve with respect to ground 
(AUCg) and increase (AUCi) and diurnal slope. Due to financial constraints hair 
samples were not collected from all participants. Instead, women providing saliva 
were approached consecutively to provide a hair sample (n=88).

2.2 Procedure 
Patients who consented were given a study pack which included six salivettes 
(Salimetrics, UK) and a pre-paid envelope for the return of the salivettes to the 
clinic. Patients were instructed to provide samples using the salivettes on the two 
days prior to commencing their down regulation medication.  Samples were 
collected at three times (upon awakening, 30 minutes post waking and 10pm) 
 Massey, A.J. 
 
10 
 
over two consecutive days on weekdays and/or weekends resulting in six samples 
per patient. Each salivette device contains a cotton swab placed within a 
suspended insert in a capped plastic tube. A member of the research team 
demonstrated their use to each participant. In brief, this involved, removing the 
swab from the tube; placing it in the mouth and gently circulating it to stimulate 
saliva flow for a period of one to two minutes. Once saturated with saliva the 
swab was placed back in the tube and firmly capped. The samples were numbered 
and the time and date was recorded on the sample at the time of sample 
collection. Participants were instructed to refrain from caffeine, alcohol and the 
consumption of glucose based beverages on sampling days. Following the 
salivette demonstration, a hair sample was taken by the study coordinator within 
the clinic. Hair samples were cut with scissors as close as possible to the scalp 
from the vertex posterior of the head. This area has the least variation in cortisol 
(e.g. 16%) as compared to other areas (e.g. 31%) of the scalp (Sauve et al., 2007). 
Before cutting the hair participants were given the opportunity to feel or look at 
the amount of hair to be cut. Hair samples were wrapped in aluminium foil and 
stored in a dry and dark cupboard. It is generally accepted that hair grows on 
average 1cm per month therefore the most proximal 1cm of hair represents the 
previous monthâ€™s cortisol exposure. Based on this, a 3cm segment of hair nearest 
to the scalp was examined. In line with previous research, this sample was 
assumed to represent the cumulative cortisol secretion over the previous three 
months (Wennig., 2000). Hair samples were taken 1 to 2 weeks prior to 
commencing treatment, while saliva samples were collected on the two days 
immediately prior to commencing downregulation treatment. At the end of the 
IVF cycle under observation medical and demographic variables were extracted

from the clinicâ€™s medical database including: clinical pregnancy - defined as a 
pregnancy diagnosed by ultrasonographic visualisation of fetal heart activity at 6 
weeks post embryo transfer ; Live birth - defined as a birth in which a fetus was 
delivered with signs of life after complete extraction from the mother beyond 20 
completed weeks of gestational age; Number of oocytes - defined as the amount 
of oocytes retrieved from the ovaries using an ultrasound-guided needle passed 
through the wall of the vagina to the ovaries; Fertilisation rate â€“ defined as the 
percentage of oocytes fertilised in vitro via penetration of the ovum by the 
spermatozoon (Zegers-Hochschild et al., 2009). 
 
2.3 Assay procedures 
2.3.1 Saliva assay  
An in-house radioimmunoassay (RIA) procedure utilizing commercial sources of 
125l cortisol label (cat no 7121126; MP Biomedical UK) and cortisol rabbit 
polyclonal antibody (20-CR50; Stratech UK) was used to determine salivary 
cortisol concentrations. On the day of the radioimmunoassay, 100ul of standards 
were pipetted in triplicate into labelled plastic LP4 tubes, QCâ€™s and unknowns 
(100ul) were pipetted in duplicate. Using an Eppendorf multipette (100ul) antibody 
was added to all tubes except the Totals and NSBâ€™s. 100ul cortisol label was then 
added to all tubes. Samples were vortexed, covered with parafilm and left 
overnight to incubate at 4oC.The following day 100ul (50ul of each) of pre diluted 
secondary antibody (Donkey Anti-Rabbit 1:80 and Normal Rabbit Serum 1:800) 
were added. Samples were vortexed, covered and left for a further 24 hours to 
incubate at 4oC. The following day 1ml Assay Buffer was added to all tubes except 
 Massey, A.J. 
 
12 
 
totals and centrifuged at 4000 rpm at 4oC for 30mins. After aspirating the 
supernatant, the pellets were counted for 60 seconds on a Wizard 1471 Gamma 
Counter (Perkin Elmer UK) using the in-house cortisol protocol. Results were 
extrapolated from standard curves and concentrations from each of the sampling 
times expressed as nmol/l. The intra and inter-assay coefficients of variance for 
this assay were below 10%. 
 
2.3.2 Hair assay  
A high sensitivity in house radioimmunoassay was used to assess levels of 
cortisol in the hair. The hair cortisol extraction and assay used in this study was 
the procedure recommended by Meyer et al. (2014). Each hair sample was 
washed by placing each sample into a 15 ml screw-cap polypropylene centrifuge 
tube. Five ml of high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-grade 
isopropanol was then added to each tube followed by repeated inversion for 3 min 
using a rotator. Three centimetres of hair was cut from the root end of each 
sample. Samples were then put into 2ml Eppendorf SafeLock tubes with 5mm 
steel balls which were used to ground the hair for 15 minutes on the Tissue Lyser. 
One ml of Methanol was then added and the samples mixed overnight shaking 
gently. The next day the tubes were centrifuged for 3 mins at 10,000 rpm in a 
micro centrifuge and the supernatant transferred to clean Eppendorf tubes and 
centrifuged a second time. In the next step, 700ul of the methanol extract was 
pipetted into glass 75x12mm tubes which were then used to dry the solvent down 
under air using the sample concentrator. The dried extract was re-dissolved in 
250ul of assay buffer and 2x 100ul taken for assay. The intra and inter-assay 
coefficients of variance for this assay were below10%. Hair cortisol 
 Massey, A.J. 
 
13 
 
concentrations were expressed in pg/mg. Concentrations of hair cortisol (pg/mg) 
within the literature have been reported to range from 5pg/mg to 153/pg/mg for 
human hair (Raul et al., 2004; Suave et al., 2007; Kirschbaum et al., 2009). 
2.4 Statistical analysis 
2.4.1 Preparation of cortisol data prior to analysis 
The cortisol awakening response (CAR) - In order to obtain a measure of the 
CAR, the second cortisol measure (sample taken 30 minutes after waking) was 
taken away from the first cortisol measure (sample taken on waking). This 
provided us with a measure of the absolute change in cortisol levels in the first 30 
minutes following waking. This measure was calculated for each of the two days 
on which saliva was collected. Mean average levels of the CAR over the two-day 
period were then used in subsequent analysis.  
 
Diurnal slope â€“ The diurnal slope was calculated in this study by regressing the 
cortisol level onto the time of the sample, with the first sampling occasion treated 
as time 0, and later times being the number of hours after this time. The resulting 
slope measure was the expected amount that logged cortisol levels dropped per 
hour over the day for each individual. As with previous research (Vedhara et al., 
2006), higher values or those closer to zero were indicative of more abnormal 
diurnal patterns. However, lower values or those further away from zero were 
indicative of more normal diurnal patterns. Mean average cortisol slope measures 
were computed across the two days and included in subsequent analysis.  
 
 Massey, A.J. 
 
14 
 
Area under the curve (AUCg and AUCi) - The AUCg measure provides 
information on total hormonal output, thus, the basal activity of the HPA axis; 
while the AUCi measure provides information on the reactivity of the system. 
Both areas under the curve (AUC) were calculated in this study using the 
formulae outlined by Pruessner et al., (2003). Mean AUC measures were 
calculated across the two days of cortisol sampling.  
 
2.4.2 Approach to data analysis 
All statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS version 21. Data screening was 
conducted to ensure data fitted the assumptions of parametric testing including 
homoscedasticity and homogeneity of variances and normal distribution. Outliers 
greater than +3 or less than -3 standard deviations were removed prior to analysis. 
Measures of salivary and hair cortisol were not normally distributed and therefore 
in accordance with recommendations log transformations were conducted prior to 
analysis (Miller and Plessow., 2013). Independent sample t tests were used to 
compare patient groups on clinical and demographic variables (age, number of 
oocytes, fertilisation rate, BMI and season of sampling) with effect size measures 
calculated using Cohenâ€™s d (Cohen, 1988). The variable â€˜season of samplingâ€™ was 
computed as follows: Spring (1 March to 31 May); Summer (1 June to 31 
August); Autumn (1 September to 30 November); Winter (1 December to 1 28 
February) (Staufenbiel et al., 2015). A priori power analysis revealed that for 
logistic regression with a binary dependent variable (clinical pregnancy) using 
several continuous independent variables, to achieve a power of .8 at a 0.05 
significance a sample size of 130 was required (Hsieh et al., 1998).  
 
 Massey, A.J. 
 
15 
 
Independent logistic regressions were conducted to examine the relationship of 
cortisol to pregnancy after controlling for clinical and demographic covariates. 
This analysis was approached in two ways. First, salivary cortisol indices and the 
hair cortisol measure were considered in separate models. This allowed us to 
examine the relationship of each individual measure separately. Second, given that 
chronic cortisol may be composed of accumulations of episodes of acute cortisol, 
a further model was constructed to identify the effects of chronic cortisol on 
pregnancy, after controlling for acute levels of the hormone. In step 1 relevant 
clinical and demographic covariates were entered (age, number of oocytes, 
fertilisation rate, BMI, season of hair sample) followed in step 2 by the addition of 
all salivary cortisol measures (CAR, AUCi, AUCg and diurnal slope) and in step 3 
hair cortisol. The primary outcome for all analyses was clinical pregnancy.

3. Results   
3.1 Comparing participants and non-participants on demographic and 
clinical variables 
Independent sample t tests were conducted to compare patients providing salivary 
and or hair cortisol data (n=135) and the original sample who were recruited 
(n=190). For all measures, no statistically significant differences were evident 
between these groups on age, number of years infertile, number of previous 
attempts, fertilisation rate (%), number of oocytes or BMI (all pâ€™s> 0.05: data not 
shown). 
 
3.2 Patient/treatment demographics and levels of cortisol  
The mean age of the participants was 34 years (mean 34.5 SD 4.8). The study 
sample comprised of both first time patients and those who had treatment before 
with n=77 (57%) patients undergoing infertility treatment for the first time, n=26 
(19%) patients were undergoing their second cycle and n=32 (24%) patients 
undergoing their third or more cycle of infertility treatment. The majority of 
couples had no children prior to treatment (n=117, 87%). The average duration of 
infertility was 2.4 years. Primary diagnoses varied across the sample with n=39 
(29%) couples diagnosed with unknown infertility, n=35 (26%) diagnosed with 
male factor and n=55 (45%) diagnosed with female factor infertility. The sample 
comprised of both health authority (n=63) and self-funded (n=72) patients. The 
majority of women undergoing treatment were employed (n=119). Over half 
(n=75) of the sample obtained a clinical pregnancy during the IVF treatment 
cycle being observed in the study; with 89% (n=67)% of those becoming 
pregnant achieving a live birth. Patient/treatment demographics and cortisol

values are presented in Table 1 for patients who subsequently became pregnant 
and those who did not. Independent sample t tests compared these groups on the 
clinical and demographic data collected at baseline. There were no significant 
differences between the patient groups on mean age (t181,157=.933, p=.322, d=.01), 
number of years infertile (t188,184=.044, p=.965, d= .01) number of previous 
treatment attempts (t188,154=.440, p=.660, d=.0) fertilisation rate (%) (t161,140=.287, 
p=.775, d=.02) number of oocytes (t141,120=1.317, p=.190, d=.02) nor BMI (t188,170 
=. 023, p=.982, d=.02).

Mean measures of salivary cortisol appeared comparable between patients 
subsequently becoming pregnant and those who did not (Table 1). Furthermore, 
as illustrated in Figure 2, there were no evident trends for any of the salivary 
cortisol indices to distinguish between the two groups. In contrast, levels of 
cortisol in hair appeared to be higher in women who subsequently did not become 
pregnant (see Table 1). Figure 3 shows the distribution of hair cortisol levels for 
the study sample.

3.3 Predicting clinical pregnancy  
 
Independent logistic regression analyses (Table 2) revealed that, after controlling 
for the covariates age, number of oocytes, fertilisation rate, BMI and season of 
hair sampling, CAR (p=.485), AUCg (p=.527), AUCi (p=.731) and diurnal slope 
(p=.889) did not predict clinical pregnancy. Post-hoc analyses examined whether 
any of the salivary cortisol measures predicted clinical pregnancy in the sub-
sample who provided both salivary and hair cortisol data (n=88). No significant 
associations were evident (all pâ€™s> 0.05: data not shown). In contrast, the analysis 
pertaining to hair cortisol demonstrated that hair cortisol concentrations were 
significantly negatively associated with clinical pregnancy (p=.017).

Given that chronic cortisol may be composed of accumulations of episodes of 
acute cortisol a further logistic regression was conducted to determine 
associations between hair cortisol and clinical pregnancy controlling for salivary 
cortisol. The results remained largely unchanged with elevated hair cortisol 
concentrations significantly predicting a reduced likelihood of clinical pregnancy 
(p=.034) accounting for between 26.7% (Cox and Snell) and 36.4% (Nagelkerke 
R2) of the variance in pregnancy outcome (See table 3). The odds ratios indicated 
that for every unit reduction in hair cortisol the odds of clinical pregnancy 
increased by 1.09.

4. Discussion 
To our knowledge, this is the first study to explore associations between both 
acute and chronic measures of cortisol exposure on the outcome of IVF. We 
examined whether levels of cortisol prior to IVF treatment were associated with 
the likelihood of clinical pregnancy. Measures of salivary cortisol (CAR, AUCg, 
AUCi and diurnal slope) did not predict clinical pregnancy. However, hair 
cortisol concentrations did, with greater levels associated with a reduced 
likelihood of conception. Our findings regarding hair cortisol add to a growing 
literature which suggests that chronic cortisol exposure may have important 
implications for health (Russell et al., 2012; Stalder and Kirschbaum, 2012) and 
highlights the use of hair sampling as a novel technique for understanding the role 
of cortisol on reproductive outcomes. Comparisons with other studies are,

however, difficult at this time, due to an absence of analogous research on the 
association between cortisol measured in hair and treatment outcomes following 
IVF. 
Our findings provide partial support for our hypothesis that, in accordance with a 
HPA-HPG pathway, chronically elevated cortisol prior to commencing IVF 
treatment would be associated with a reduced likelihood of pregnancy. The 
absence of a relationship between salivary cortisol and clinical pregnancy should 
not necessarily be interpreted as evidence against the HPA-HPG pathway or 
cortisol influencing treatment outcomes in IVF. Rather, it may simply reflect the 
fact that hair derived assessments offer a more accurate picture of basal HPA 
activity as they capture cortisol exposure over a longer duration. In contrast, 
salivary derived assessments are, by definition, acute and therefore, a less precise 
indicator of basal activity. Indeed, the sampling protocol used in the present study 
(3 saliva samples over 2 consecutive days) could be considered the minimum 
standard for measuring cortisol and may have contributed to our null findings for 
salivary cortisol (Saxbe, 2008).The implications of our findings for the HPA-
immune pathway are, however, more difficult to discern as we did not collect 
immunological measures and so cannot determine the relationship of cortisol to 
immunity or distinguish between the HPA-HPG and HPA-immune pathways. 
It should be noted that the present study does not elucidate the factors that may 
cause chronic elevations in cortisol secretion (e.g., sleep, physical activity, stress) 
(Kudeilka et al., 2009). However, our data do suggest that interventions to reduce 
cortisol, pharmacological or behavioural, may be advantageous in the period prior 
to commencing fertility treatment. Stress in particular has established itself as a 
potent trigger of elevated cortisol secretion within the wider literature (Dickerson 
 Massey, A.J. 
 
25 
 
and Kemeny, 2004) and therefore the focus of efforts to date has been on how 
psychological interventions may be used to mitigate the effects of long term 
cortisol exposure on health. Although evidence is not currently available from 
patients undergoing IVF, there are data from other populations suggesting that 
psychological interventions can significantly alter levels of cortisol measured in 
hair. For example, a recent study by Goldberg et al. (2014) explored the effects of 
mindfulness or a cognitive behavioural intervention for smoking cessation on hair 
cortisol concentrations and reported a significant decrease in hair cortisol 
following both interventions. There have, of course, also been studies which fail 
to find an effect of psychological interventions on hair cortisol (e.g., Young et al. 
2015). Clearly, further research is required to examine the effectiveness of 
psychological and other interventions in reducing cortisol levels and their 
subsequent effects on IVF treatment outcomes. 
A notable strength of this study was that both acute and chronic indices of cortisol 
production were examined in patients prior to IVF treatment whilst accounting 
for several confounds known to influence acute cortisol secretion (age, smoking, 
caffeine consumption, time of sampling). However, several methodological 
limitations are also worthy of note. First, as noted previously, the sampling 
protocol used in the present study is considered the minimum standard for 
assessing cortisol concentrations in naturalistic research (Saxbe, 2008; Clow et 
al., 2009). Second, several potential covariates were not accounted for including 
natural hair colour and frequency of hair washing which have been shown to 
influence hair cortisol concentrations (Staufenbiel et al., 2015). Similarly, data 
were not collected on shift work or whether samples were collected during 
weekdays or weekends. These factors have been shown to influence circadian

cortisol levels (Mirick et al., 2013; Thorn et al., 2006) and may have influenced 
our findings. It is also not clear how generalizable our results are to women trying 
to conceive naturally; also our findings extend only to clinical pregnancy. 
Therefore, it is unclear whether chronic cortisol is associated with live births 
following IVF although 89% of patients who became pregnant subsequently went 
on to have a live birth. 
Despite these potential limitations, the present study extends the available 
evidence for the role of cortisol on clinical pregnancy in IVF patients (Massey et 
al., 2014) and provides the first evidence that elevated chronic cortisol levels are 
associated with a reduced likelihood of pregnancy. The pathways by which 
cortisol may influence reproduction, however, remain unclear, . Thus, further 
research is needed to not only corroborate these findings but also identify the 
pathways.
