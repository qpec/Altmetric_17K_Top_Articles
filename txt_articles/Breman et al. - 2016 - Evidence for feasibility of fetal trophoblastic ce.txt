ABSTRACT
Objective The goal was to develop methods for detection of chromosomal and subchromosomal abnormalities in
fetal cells in the mother’s circulation at 10–16 weeks’ gestation using analysis by array comparative genomic
hybridization (CGH) and/or next-generation sequencing (NGS).
Method Nucleated cells from 30 mL of blood collected at 10–16 weeks’ gestation were separated from red cells by
density fractionation and then immunostained to identify cytokeratin positive and CD45 negative trophoblasts.
Individual cells were picked and subjected to whole genome amplification, genotyping, and analysis by array CGH
and NGS.
Results Fetal cells were recovered from most samples as documented by Y chromosome PCR, short tandem repeat
analysis, array CGH, and NGS including over 30 normal male cells, one 47,XXY cell from an affected fetus, one trisomy
18 cell from an affected fetus, nine cells from a trisomy 21 case, three normal cells and one trisomy 13 cell from a case
with confined placental mosaicism, and two chromosome 15 deletion cells from a case known by CVS to have a 2.7 Mb
de novo deletion.
Conclusion We believe that this is the first report of using array CGH and NGS whole genome sequencing to detect
chromosomal abnormalities in fetal trophoblastic cells from maternal blood. © 2016 The Authors. Prenatal Diagnosis

INTRODUCTION
The presence of fetal cells in maternal blood during the first
and second trimesters was first described in 19691 and
confirmed in 1979,2 and the potential to use these cells for
prenatal diagnosis was immediately appreciated. Despite
extensive efforts focused on recovery of fetal nucleated red
blood
cells
(fnRBCs)
followed
by
fluorescence
in
situ
hybridization (FISH) to detect aneuploidy, a collaborative
effort reported in 2002 was unable to establish fetal cell-based
analysis as a reliable prenatal clinical test.3 In 2001, it was
demonstrated that fetal cells could be found in 12 of 12 of
women with a normal male pregnancy at 18–22 weeks’
gestation,4 but first trimester sampling is of greater clinical
relevance. Although there is one report in 20125 of successful
analysis of trophoblasts in pregnancies at risk of cystic fibrosis
or spinal muscular atrophy, this single gene analysis has not
been
independently
replicated.
The
rapid
commercial
development and increase in utilization of cell-free fetal DNA
(cffDNA) for noninvasive testing to detect Down syndrome
and other aneuploidies have led to a dramatic reduction in
the number of amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling
(CVS) diagnostic procedures.5,6 With the current limitations

 of cffDNA assays, this reduction in invasive testing can be
predicted to lead to an increased number of births of infants
with
cytogenetic
abnormalities,
especially
deletions
and
unbalanced translocations that would have been detected by
an invasive test with karyotype or microarray analysis, but are
not detected by the current cffDNA analysis.6
There are many reports of attempts to recover trophoblasts7–11
and fnRBCs12–15 from maternal blood; see Bianchi et al for
older references.3 Attempts to recover male fnRBCs in blood
samples obtained prior to CVS or pregnancy termination from
women carrying male pregnancies failed in 60–70% of cases3,16
leaving some doubt as to whether this cell type is present in
sufficient
numbers
for
routine
analysis
during
the
first
trimester. In contrast, two groups have demonstrated that
there are one to six fetal cells per milliliter of mother’s blood
during the first trimester using very reliable methods for Y
chromosome FISH, and showed that these cells are certainly17
or most likely18 trophoblasts. Based on these reports, we have
focused exclusively on detecting trophoblasts. Cytokeratins
are long known to be expressed in trophoblasts,19 and a
cocktail of cytokeratin (CK) antibodies was reported to be
effective in staining fetal trophoblastic cells in the maternal
circulation.17
We
recognize
that
trophoblasts
are
not
technically from the fetus, but just as with CVS, the diagnostic
results can be interpreted as being indicative of the fetal
genomic status (barring confined placental mosaicism). We
use the word fetal in this manuscript to refer to cells having
the fetal as opposed to the maternal genome.
Investigators have tried a variety of strategies to enrich
circulating fetal cells, including density gradients, immuno-
magnetic bead isolations, fluorescence activated cell sorting
(FACS), and filters.3,5 Although circulating fetal cells can be
recovered,
these
methods
have
lacked
consistency
and
repeatability. In addition to the complexities of enrichment,
the fetal cells should be retrieved individually, genotyped to
exclude maternal cell contamination, and amplified to yield
DNA that is of sufficient quality and quantity for genome-wide
analysis. Until now, there is no report of genome-wide
microarray analysis or next-generation sequencing (NGS)
analysis of copy number using fetal cells recovered from
maternal blood during the first trimester or early second
trimester; both microarray and NGS analyses are reported
here. If it were possible to perform high resolution analysis of
fetal cells, there is the potential to develop a noninvasive test
that could detect smaller deletions and duplications that are
not currently reliably detectable using cffDNA analysis.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Sample collection
Blood samples were collected from healthy volunteers from
multiple
referring
centers,
following
informed
consent,
according to a protocol approved by Baylor College of
Medicine or University of Washington Institutional Review
Boards. Participants included women being seen for routine
genetic counseling in one of several centers, and in many but
not all cases the women were scheduled to undergo a CVS or
amniocentesis
for
prenatal
diagnosis
via
conventional
chromosome
analysis
or
array
comparative
genomic
hybridization (CGH) analysis. Blood samples were drawn prior
to any procedure. Approximately 30 mL was collected from
volunteers
into
anticoagulant
EDTA
Vacutainer®
tubes
(Becton-Dickinson) with a proprietary preservative (available
from RareCyte).
Fetal gender determination
Maternal plasma was separated from 4 mL of whole blood by
two rounds of centrifugation at 3000 ×g for 10 min each. The
cffDNA was extracted from 500-μL plasma using the MagNA
Pure Compact DNA extraction system, Nucleic Acid Isolation
Kit
I,
Large
Volume,
according
to
the
manufacturer’s
instructions (Roche Diagnostics). Gender PCR was carried out
on each cffDNA in triplicate on the LightCycler® 480 Real-
Time PCR System (Roche) using Y-chromosome specific
primers
and
TaqMan
probes
for
the
multicopy
DYS14
sequence located within the TSPY gene and the single copy
SRY gene as described in.20 PCR was performed at 95 °C for
3 min, followed by 49 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s, 64 °C for 30 s, with
a final 30-s step at 40 °C. Multiple positive and negative
controls were used in each reaction. The fetus was determined
to be female if no positive replicates were obtained and male if
there were at least two replicates with positive amplifications
(Ct of 30–33 for DYS14 and 34–40 for SRY).
Fetal cell enrichment and staining
Fetal
cell
enrichment
was
carried
out
with
RareCyte’s
trophoblast enrichment and staining method. This has been
described for the identification and retrieval of circulating
tumor cells (CTCs)21 and was modified to allow for retrieval
of rare target cells from liquid slide preps. Briefly, 6 mL of
preserved blood was added to the AccuCyte® Separation
(ACS) tube (RareCyte, Inc., Supporting Information Figure
S1A).21 In an attempt to reduce the number of slides to be
scanned in order to increase the throughput of the test, a step
for WBC depletion was explored. In the majority of samples
where WBC depletion was performed, RosetteSep Human
CD45
and
CD36
Depletion
Cocktails
(STEMCELL
Technologies) were combined with the blood for 20 min at
room temperature (RT). In some cases a slightly modified
WBC depletion protocol was carried out but both gave
equivalent WBC depletion and fetal cell recovery results. A
float (density 1.058–1.061 g/cm3) was then added to the ACS
tube. The sample was centrifuged at 5250 ×g for 30 min, a
sealing ring was applied to the outside of the ACS tube below
the WBC band on the float, and the plasma was aspirated. Next
150 μL of a high-density retrieval fluid (Fluid A) was added, and
the ACS tube was centrifuged at 1000 ×g for 5 min displacing
the less dense WBCs to above the float. A second sealing ring
was placed at the top of the float to keep the WBCs in solution
above the float. Then 30 μL of 5% paraformaldehyde (Ted Pella,
Inc.,) in PBS was added. After 20 min, cells were stained for 1 h at
RT by adding a blocking/permeabilizing solution, followed by
staining cocktail containing DAPI (BioLegend), anti-cytokeratin
Alexa-488
(eBiosciences,
clone
AE1/AE3),
anti-cytokeratin

 Alexa-488 (BioLegend clone C11), and anti-CD45 PE (BioLegend
clone 2D1).
Fetal cell recovery
Following staining, the cells were collected and removed from
the antibody cocktail as follows. Briefly, 1 mL of a density
increasing reagent (Fluid A) was mixed into the staining
solution slurry. The EpiCollector® (RareCyte, Inc.) device
was then inserted into the ACS tube and a second fluid of
lesser density (Fluid B) was gently layered on top of the
denser staining solution slurry. A 1.5-mL isolation tube
containing 200 μL of a 1.1 g/cm3 collection fluid (Fluid C), less
dense than Fluid B, was inserted into the EpiCollector. The
ACS tube, now containing a gradient of density fluids without
air gaps, was centrifuged at 1000 ×g for 20 min. During
centrifugation,
cells
that
have
density < 1.1 g/cm3
float
upward out of the denser fluids into Fluid C within the
collection tube. The cells have thus been drawn through the
antibody
solution,
removing
unbound
antibody
in
a
‘pseudo-wash’ process. The isolation tube was then removed
from the EpiCollector, 800 μL of PBS was added and stored at
4 °C until imaging.
Automated image capture and analysis
Stained cells were pipetted into custom well slides (CyteSlide,
RareCyte, Supporting Information Figure S1B) that were
placed onto the CyteFinder digital scanning microscope to
acquire fluorescent images (Supporting Information Figure
S1C, S2). The CyteFinder acquired 4-channel fluorescent
images of low magnification (10 × objective) fields of view
for
each
CyteSlide
covering
the
entire
well.
The
high
resolution images (40 × objective) of revisited points were
imaged with a ‘stack’ of images through the Z plane with 1-
μm steps.
Images were analyzed for the presence of signal above
background for CK and CD45 using image analysis software
that
employs
an
adaptive
auto-threshold
algorithm
(RareCyte). Candidate cells that were determined by the
algorithm
to
be
CK
positive
and
CD45
negative
were
presented to the operator by the software for manual
confirmation as potential fetal cells.
Retrieval of individual fetal cells from CyteSlides
Isolation of single cells from CyteSlides was performed with
CytePicker®
that
is part
of
the CyteFinder
instrument.
CytePicker
is
a
hydraulically
controlled
semi-automated
single cell retrieval device that contains three critical parts:
(1) needle with 40-μm bore ceramic tip, (2) pump capable
of 10-nL droplet resolution, and (3) precision Z-positioning
system.
After
verification
that
the
candidate
cell
met
trophoblastic
cell
criteria
described
above,
cells
were
retrieved using a semi-automated picking routine. During
the routine, the glass surface of the CyteSlide is detected with
a sensor, the needle is lowered over the cell of interest and a
200-nL volume is then aspirated to withdraw the cell into the
needle tip. To ensure the isolation of single fetal cells without
associated WBCs, the initial aspirated volume was dispensed
into a cell sorting well in the CyteSlide for repicking to further
separate the cell of interest from any co-aspirated white
blood cells. The cell of interest was then re-picked and
dispensed into the bottom of a PCR tube and immediately
frozen at �80 °C.
Whole Genome Amplification and Y-chromosome specific PCR
Whole genome amplification (WGA) was performed using
either
the
PicoPLEX
WGA
kit
(Rubicon
Genomics)
or
Ampli1™
WGA
Kit
(Silicon
BioSystems)
in
an
Applied
Biosystems 2720 (ThermoFisher Scientific), a C1000 Touch
(Bio-Rad)
or
a
MyCycler™
Thermal
Cycler
(Bio-Rad),
according
to
manufacturers’
instructions.
To
minimize
contamination, all WGA reactions were carried out inside a
PCR workstation (AirClean Systems) in a pre-PCR room.
PCR products were purified using a DNA Clean Concentrator
TM-25 kit (Zymo Research) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. DNA was subsequently eluted into 50 μL of
water and stored at �20 °C. The WGA DNA quality and
concentration were determined using a Nanodrop spec-
trophotometer (Nanodrop Inc.).
For male pregnancies, Y-chromosome specific PCRs were
performed to confirm the cells contained the fetal genome.
Hemi-nested PCR was performed in two rounds. Primers Y1.5
and Y1.8 were added at 0.2 μM22 with 0.5 mM each dATP,
dGTP, dCTP, and 0.25 mM dTTP and dUTP (Promega),
Colorless GoTaq Flexi Buffer (Promega), 0.625 units GoTaq
polymerase (Promega), and 2 mM MgCl2. PCR was performed
at 95 °C for 5 min, followed by 40 cycles of 94 °C for 45 s, 56 °C
for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s, with a final 7-min extension at 72 °
C and hold at 4°C. A nested PCR was performed using 1 μL of
the product from the first round of PCR as template but using
primers Y1.7 and Y1.822 with the same conditions as described
above. Additional PCR tests for the presence of the Y
chromosome were performed using the above conditions but
using primers to DYS14 or DAZ,23 2.5 mM MgCl2, and a 58 °C
annealing temperature. PCR products were visualized on EX
E-Gels
(ThermoFisher)
with
E-Gel
50 bp
ladder
(ThermoFisher). PCR targeting the X chromosome was also
performed (data not shown).
STR analysis
For cases where the fetus was determined to be female or
where Y-PCR was inconclusive, WGA products from single
cells were PCR amplified using a STR kit designed by Silicon
Biosystems, which consists of a multiplex primer set targeted
to 11 polymorphic tetranucleotide repeats across the human
genome. Genomic DNA was also isolated from 1 mL of
parental whole blood using the QIAgen DSP Blood Mini Kit
(QIAgen) to serve as controls. When available, fetal genomic
DNA obtained from either direct or cultured CVS tissue or
amniotic fluid was also analyzed. STR was carried out
according to the manufacturer’s recommendations, and the
resulting products were analyzed by capillary electrophoresis.
The allele patterns of the WGA products were then compared
to the fetal and parental genomic DNA patterns to assess for
allelic dropout and expected inheritance patterns. All PCR
reactions were prepared in an AirClean PCR workstation.
Data analysis was performed using GeneMapper® version

 4.0 analysis software (Life Technologies). Any peak with
amplitude of less than 1000 RFUs was considered noise and
not counted.
Array CGH
WGA products from single cells were analyzed by array CGH
using
oligonucleotide-based
SurePrint
G3
Human
CGH
4x180K
arrays
from
Agilent
Technologies
as
described
previously.24 Briefly, 1 μg of WGA DNA was labeled per
hybridization,
using
a
Nanodrop
spectrophotometer
for
quantification. Because the WGA products ranged in size from
100 bp
to
1 kb,
it
was
not
necessary
to
perform
DNA
fragmentation before labeling. Fetal DNA was labeled with
dCTP-Cy5 and reference DNA was labeled with dCTP-Cy3, for
3 h at 37 °C using the SureTag DNA Labeling Kit (Agilent).
Unincorporated
nucleotides
were
removed
using
a
MultiScreen-PCRμ96 Filter Plate (Millipore). Hybridizations
were carried out at 65 °C for 40–72 h to enhance the binding
of WGA DNA. The DNA used as a reference for each fetal cell
WGA product was a pool of WGA DNA from multiple (5–10
single cell) WGA reactions from either male or female
lymphoblast
reference
cell
lines.
Gender-mismatched
references using singe cells amplified with the same WGA
method were used.
Analysis of array data
Slides were scanned into image files using the Agilent G2565
Microarray Scanner. Scanned images were quantified using
Agilent Feature Extraction software (v10.10.0.23). Text file
outputs containing quantitative data were imported into the
Agilent CytoGenomics software (version 2.5.8.11). Data were
analyzed using the Aberration Detection Method 2 (ADM2)
statistical algorithm at a threshold of 6.0 to identify genomic
intervals with copy number changes. To reduce false positive
calls, a filter was applied to define the minimum log2 ratio
(0.25), the minimum size (100 kb), and the minimum number
of probes (100) in a CNV interval. The Derivative Log Ratio
Spread (DRLS), a measure of probe to probe noise calculated
by the CytoGenomics software, was used as a performance
measure
for
hybridization
quality.

 negative, false positive, or false negative. The 100 probe
number and 1 Mb interval were chosen arbitrarily at this
stage of development to minimize the number of false
positive calls because of the noisiness associated with single
cell WGA, although the ultimate objective is to detect the
smallest possible CNVs with a minimum number of false
positives.
Single cell next-generation sequencing
In addition to array CGH analysis, we also explored the use of
whole
shotgun
NGS
to
determine
copy
number
as
is
commonly applied to embryonic cells for preimplantation
genetic screening.28,29 We aimed to obtain about 5 million
NGS
reads
per
cell.
Paired-end
sequencing
reads
were
obtained for each sample. Reads were mapped to human
reference
genome
hg19
using
Burrows–Wheeler
Aligner
(BWA) 25. Base quality recalibration and local realignment were
performed using the Genome Analysis Tool Kit (GATK).26
To identify copy number variations (CNVs), first the human
genome was divided into slide windows according to the
control sample. The aligned reads of the control sample were
binned into variable-length windows, and the number of
mapped reads in every window was the same. Then the
aligned reads of the case sample were counted in each
window and the log2 ratio between the case and control
was calculated.
For trisomy detection,
there were 4000
mapped reads within each window, and the total number of
windows
across
the
genome
was
around
2100.
The
segmentation and copy number estimation was performed
using CGHweb R package.27
RESULTS
Trophoblastic cell enrichment
We chose to focus on recovery of trophoblasts that were CK
positive based on existing literature,17 and we used CD45
staining to exclude most maternal white blood cells. The cells
that later proved to carry the fetal genome were completely
negative for CD45 staining and had characteristic CK staining
that varied from a diffuse cytoplasmic distribution to a
micro-globular
appearance
(Figure
1A).
The
nuclear
morphology was usually round and smooth with diffuse
uniform DAPI staining in contrast to the variegated nuclear
staining
of
mononuclear
cells
and
lobulated
nuclei
of
neutrophils, but occasional fetal nuclei showed fragmentation
(Figure 1B). These may represent fetal cells at various stages
of degradation within maternal circulation.
Fetal cell verification
Candidate fetal cells that were subjected to WGA were
characterized by Y chromosome specific PCR and genotyping
with short tandem repeats (STR) to assess for gender and allelic
inheritance patterns (Figure 1C, D). Blood samples from 30
male pregnancies
(including
one
47,XXY)
from
multiple
collection venues were demonstrated to have cells that were
genotypically male by Y-PCR. For those cases where the fetus
was female or Y-PCR was inconclusive, STR analysis was
performed. Allele dropout was common, and only cells with
multiple non-maternal alleles were scored as fetal genome
positive (Table 1). The average recovery of circulating fetal cells
was
0.74
per
milliliter
using
our
initial
protocol.
After
implementing a WBC depletion method to reduce slide
numbers
and
increase
sample
throughput,
the
average
recovery of fetal cells was 0.36 per milliliter (Table 1) indicating
that increased throughput may reduce total fetal cell recovery.
For the most part, arrays and NGS were only performed on
samples
with
known
abnormalities
or
on
a
select
few
representative male cases to demonstrate feasibility. All others
were verified using Y-PCR or STR only.
A subset of cells proven to be fetal genome positive by Y
PCR and/or STR genotyping were analyzed using array CGH
and/or NGS, including eight cases having a known or
suspected cytogenetic abnormality (trisomy 13, trisomy 18,
trisomy 21, XXY, and two microdeletions). The sex of the
fetus was either known independently from ultrasound or
invasive prenatal diagnosis or was determined using Y-
specific PCR of maternal plasma.20 We performed array
CGH and/or NGS on at least 40 single cells from 16
pregnancies, including 17 normal male cells to show the
sex chromosome copy number differences, one 47,XXY, 14
trisomy 21, one trisomy 18, one trisomy 13, 2 cells with a
2.7 Mb deletion on 15q and 4 cells with a 1.2 Mb deletion
on 1q (Table 1). Looking first at array CGH data, four cells
from
a
single
normal
male
pregnancy
(NIPT365)
all
demonstrate
the
expected
sex
chromosome
differences
(Figure 2). The gain of copy number for the X chromosome
is shown in Figure 3 for a 47,XXY case (NIPT342) sampled
at 13 weeks’ gestation following a positive cffDNA result for
sex
chromosome
abnormality.
The
blood
sample
was
obtained prior to a CVS which showed 47,XXY. Also shown in
Figure 3 is an array on a single cell from a case (NIPT375)
suspected to have a female fetus with trisomy 18 based on
cffDNA analysis; a blood sample was obtained from the
mother at 13 weeks’ gestation prior to a CVS procedure,
which
confirmed
trisomy
18
by
karyotype
analysis.
A
microdeletion
case
was
studied
following
a
clinical
microarray analysis on a CVS sample that demonstrated a
1.2 Mb deletion of chromosome 1q21.1q21.2 (NIPT359). Array
analyses on four individual fetal cells from this case did not
detect the abnormality.
NGS analysis of abnormal samples
Fetal cells were isolated and analyzed by NGS for five
pregnancies subsequently proven to have a chromosomal
abnormality and one pregnancy with likely confined placental
mosaicism. Figure 3 shows comparison of array CGH and
NGS analyses for the 47,XXY case and the trisomy 18 case.
An additional four cells with trisomy 21 are shown in
Figure 4, all from a single case (NIPT511) in which all 11 fetal
cells analyzed successfully showed trisomy 21. This case
presented with cystic hygroma, and a blood sample was
obtained from the mother at 13 weeks’ gestation prior to a
CVS procedure, which confirmed trisomy 21 by karyotype
analysis.
A
case
of
a
2.7 Mb
deletion
of
chromosome
15q25.2q25.3 (NIPT479) was also studied, from which two

 fetal cells were recovered and both showed the deletion (one
cell shown in Figure 5). This demonstrates the potential for
detecting relatively small deletions from individually isolated
fetal cells.
Another notable case (NIPT497) was instructive regarding a
likely occurrence of confined placental mosaicism. This case
was recruited for study prior to a CVS procedure to confirm
a positive plasma-based NIPT result positive for trisomy 13.
The CVS cytogenetic
studies were normal, indicating a
‘false-positive’ NIPT result. Of the nine fetal cells identified
from this case, one cell demonstrated trisomy 13 and three
additional cells had a normal copy number; the remaining
five cells have not been analyzed (Figure 6). These data
support the widely held suspicion that confined placental
mosaicism is one source of positive plasma-based NIPT
results followed by normal amniocentesis or CVS.

 DISCUSSION
These results presented here show that we can successfully
isolate circulating trophoblasts and use them for noninvasive
genome analysis by array CGH and NGS to demonstrate
chromosomal aneuploidy and confirm fetal gender. There are
important potential advantages of cell-based compared to
cell-free NIPT if genome-wide copy number analysis can be
performed rather than using FISH as was often attempted in
earlier years. First, any findings or abnormalities detected
reflect the genome of the fetus and not that of the mother.
Second, the ability to analyze multiple single cells allows for
detection
of
mosaicism
and
for
analysis
of
multiple
independent cells. If this test were to be used clinically, it
would be desirable to study three to five or more cells from a
single sample. Third, although very deep sequencing of cell-
free DNA may eventually allow for detection of smaller CNVs,

chromosome and gain of the Y chromosome (black arrows) following hybridization with a normal female reference DNA sample. Array
data is displayed as a 20 Mb moving average across the genome

 it is unlikely that this can ever be as cost effective and as
reliable as analyzing pure fetal trophoblastic DNA. Finally,
one long-term goal should be to detect de novo point
mutations, and this is predicted to be more reliable by testing
multiple single fetal cells as compared to cell-free DNA, where
any de novo mutation may reflect a somatic change in the
mother that is not present in the fetus. We attribute the success
in recovering fetal cells reported to persistence in the face of
many failures, meticulous attention to minor variations in the
protocol, willingness to accept recovery of trophoblasts rather
nucleated RBCs, and technological advances of the RareCyte
system.
The current protocol includes considerable manipulation
which could damage cells, and it is possible that more cells
can be recovered with improved methods based on reports of
one to six fetal cells per milliliter of maternal blood in some
studies.18
Concern
has
been
raised
in
the
past
about
persistence of fetal cells from previous pregnancies. While
there
is
clear
evidence
that
male
progenitor
cells
or
lymphocytes can be recovered from the maternal blood as long
as 27 years after a pregnancy,30 these cells are very rare and
would not be expected to be positive for CK staining.
Therefore, persistent cells from a previous pregnancy are
extremely unlikely to be recovered by this method.

 Another
question
to
consider
is
whether
analysis
of
trophoblast cells could result in positive findings because of
confined placental mosaicism, which is detected by CVS in
approximately 1–2% of viable pregnancies at 9–12 weeks of
gestation.31,32 We have already encountered one case reflecting
confined placental mosaicism (NIPT497), and we anticipate
that the frequency will be similar to that observed with current
chromosomal analyses performed on CVS specimens and,
therefore, would not be unfamiliar or of high frequency.
Depending on whether the mechanism of mosaicism is similar
to or different than that seen in direct and indirect CVS,
sensitivity for detection of placental mosaicism may be lower
or higher than that seen with CVS. The sensitivity for detection
of mosaicism will depend on the number of cells studied, and
in cases of aneuploidy results, it may be feasible to obtain a
second blood sample and analyze 10–20 individual cells as
evidenced by recovery of nine trisomy 21 cells from one blood
sample.
However,
the
frequency
of
confined
placental
mosaicism detected by this assay will need to be determined
empirically through validation studies. One goal would be to
reduce the risk of failing to detect mosaicism when it is present
by analyzing multiple cells, perhaps three to five, individually
by NGS or array. Any positive findings of even a single cell with
aneuploidy potentially caused by mosaicism present in the
placenta
could
be
resolved
definitively
by
follow-up
amniocentesis, as is currently recommended for mosaic CVS
results. False negative placental mosaicism where CVS was
normal but a child was born with aneuploidy is exceedingly
rare in cultured cells but has been observed in direct analysis,31
and it would likely be rare with circulating trophoblasts as well,
although this would likely depend on the number of cells
analyzed in all routine cases.
An important question is whether cell-based fetal copy
number analysis can become a routine prenatal test offered
to low-risk as well as high-risk pregnant women. It is known
that current forms of noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT)
based on analysis of cell-free DNA are not highly reliable for
detecting subchromosomal abnormalities. One recent report
using 3.5 million reads for cell-free NIPT found 71.8% detection
of variable sized subchromosomal copy number abnormalities
and 55 false-positives in 1476 samples.33 Another report using
standard read depth for trisomy testing detected 15/18
samples with pathogenic rearrangements >6 Mb but only 2/
10 samples with rearrangements <6 Mb.34 Based on our
experience indicating that copy number variants (CNVs) can
be detected at a resolution of 1 Mb in single lymphoblast
cells,24 we are optimistic that a similar resolution can be
obtained with single trophoblastic cells, although these cells
are often subjected to fixation and/or permeabilization, and
analysis of fetal trophoblastic cells from the mother’s blood is
more difficult than for unfixed cultured cells. Our current data
demonstrate that a 2.7 Mb deletion could be detected from two
individual single trophoblastic cells by NGS whereas a 1.2 Mb
deletion was not detectable in any of four single cells by array
CGH. While optimization of WGA methods could improve
our copy number resolution, this 2.7 Mb deletion is well below
the limits of resolution for currently available plasma-based
NIPT. The experience with various forms of pre-implantation
genetic screening on single cells or small pools of cells suggests
the technical feasibility of such an approach.35,36 There is
evidence that single nuclei can be analyzed in batches of 48
or 96 using NGS with copy number detection at a resolution
of 54 kb in 5–6 days,37,38 but this resolution has not been shown
with single cells subjected to fixation and permeabilization.
Furthermore, it is not yet possible to definitively identify a cell
as carrying the fetal genome without molecular confirmation.
We therefore propose that any test should include robust
genotyping of individual cells following WGA but prior to any
pooling or further analysis, primarily so that maternal cells
can be identified and eliminated. This is especially important
with female pregnancies because the gender cannot be used
as confirmation of fetal origin. We currently believe that single
cell NGS for three to five cells may be the most attractive
pathway for a robust and high throughput routine clinical test.
We have made no estimates of false positive or false negative
rates at this time. We are initiating a validation study in women
undergoing amniocentesis or CVS with array CGH, and
comparing that result to the results obtained from cell-based
NIPT using array CGH and NGS.
Perhaps, the most important factor in the feasibility of
using cell-based NIPT will be the false positive rate for CNVs
that might lead to unnecessary invasive procedures. This will

shown above, and the only trisomy 13 cell is shown below. Clinical cytogenetic studies on CVS tissue from this pregnancy showed a normal
female FISH result and a 46,XX chromosome complement with no evidence of trisomy 13 mosaicism. NGS data is displayed as 1000 kb bins
across the genome

 undoubtedly be linked to the level of resolution attempted in
the microarray or NGS analysis with attempts to call smaller
CNVs associated with a higher false positive rate. We are
hopeful
that
cell-based
NIPT
using
array
CGH,
single
nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays, or copy number
analysis by NGS can evolve to be as accurate as chromosomal
microarrays performed after amniocentesis or CVS. As part of
the cell analysis or cell selection, it may be necessary to take
into account whether cells are in S phase or not, because S
phase can cause unevenness of copy number for early and
late
replicating
portions
of
the
genome.39
Based
on
unpublished data for NGS of single cells in S phase (N. Navin,
personal communication), we believe that it will be possible
to identify cells in S phase by NGS and exclude them from
clinical interpretation. We have not detected any fetal cells
in S phase to date.
Based on the experience from preimplantation diagnosis, it
should be possible to analyze single gene mutations with
substantial advantages over cffDNA in the case of maternally
inherited variants. It is reasonable to ask whether de novo point
mutations could be detected using cell-based NIPT. This
approach is already available using cffDNA,40 but there is
evidence that artifacts arising in amplification or sequencing
can cause a high rate of false positives in this context.41
However, there is additional work suggesting that amplifying
at least three individual cells or pools of cells and barcoding
to focus on mutations in all three analyses can minimize the
rate of false positive de novo mutations.42 Efforts to screen all
pregnancies (including low risk) using exome- or genome-wide
sequencing for de novo point mutations is a difficult challenge,
but this is likely to become feasible.43–45 De novo mutations in
~500 genes causing severe intellectual disability are believed to
occur with a frequency of 3–5 per thousand,46 which would be
3–5 times higher than the incidence of Down syndrome.
Another question is whether cell-based NIPT can become a
high throughput test that can be offered to millions of women.
We anticipate that NGS, as is currently used for high
throughput cffDNA analysis, can ultimately be applied for
sample analysis as an alternative to microarrays. We further
believe that all of the enrichment, staining, picking, genotyping,
amplification, and NGS steps can be automated. The current
work-flow is complex, the number of cells recovered is
relatively low, and we have not performed a clinical validation
study,
but
the
core
feasibility
of
cell-based
NIPT
is
demonstrated, and we believe that the limitations can be
overcome. The cell isolation and WGA for the cases presented
herein were performed at two different laboratories (Seattle
and Houston, respectively), indicating some consistency of
the methodology. We believe that this is the first demonstration
of the successful use of array CGH and NGS whole genome
sequencing to detect chromosomal abnormalities in fetal cells
from maternal blood, including detection of a 2.7 Mb deletion.

WHAT’S ALREADY KNOWN ABOUT THIS TOPIC?
• Analysis of cell-free DNA for noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT) is
widely practiced, and the frequency of amniocentesis and CVS
has decreased.
• However, cell-free NIPT is not adequate for detecting smaller
deletions and duplications with high specificity, sensitivity, and
positive predictive value.
• Although fetal nucleated red blood cells and trophoblastic cells are
known to be present in the maternal circulation, it has not been
possible to develop a reliable cytogenetic cell-based form of NIPT.
WHAT DOES THIS STUDY ADD?
• Fetal cytotrophoblasts were successfully recovered from maternal
blood.
• Although a clinical test has not been validated, for the first time, the
feasibility of using array comparative genomic hybridization and
next
generation
sequencing
to
detect
chromosomal
and
subchromosomal abnormalities is demonstrated.
• The results suggest the possibility of developing a cell-based form of
NIPT with ability to detect abnormalities with a similar accuracy as
can currently be obtained with amniocentesis and CVS.
