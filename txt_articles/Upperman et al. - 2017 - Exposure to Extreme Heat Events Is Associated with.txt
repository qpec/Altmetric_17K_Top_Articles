Abstract
Background—Warmer temperature can alter seasonality of pollen as well as pollen 
concentration, and may impact allergic diseases such as hay fever. Recent studies suggest that 
extreme heat events will likely increase in frequency, intensity, and duration in coming decades in 
response to changing climate.

 Objective—The overall objective of this study is to investigate if extreme heat events are 
associated with hay fever.
Methods—We linked National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) data from 1997 to 2013 
(N=505,386 respondents) with extreme heat event data, defined as days when daily maximum 
temperature (TMAX) exceeded the 95th percentile values of TMAX for a 30-year reference period 
(1960–1989). We used logistic regression to investigate the associations between exposure to 
annual and seasonal extreme heat events and adult hay fever prevalence among the NHIS 
respondents.
Results—During 1997–2013, hay fever prevalence among adults 18 years and older was 8.43%. 
Age, race/ethnicity, poverty status, education, and sex were significantly associated with hay fever 
status. We observed that adults in the highest quartile of exposure to extreme heat events had a 7% 
increased odds of hay fever compared to those in the lowest quartile of exposure (Odds Ratios 
1.07, 95% Confidence Interval: 1.02–1.11). This relationship was more pronounced for extreme 
heat events that occurred during spring season, with evidence of an exposure-response relationship 
(Ptrend <0.01).
Conclusion—Our data suggest that exposure to extreme heat events is associated with increased 
prevalence of hay fever among US adults.

Introduction
Hay fever affects 17.6 million (7.5%) adults in the United States (US) annually and can have 
an impact on their quality of life.1–3 In 2005, hay fever-related medical expenses in the 
United States amounted to $11.2 billion.4,5
Hay fever, a term often used for seasonal allergic rhinitis, is a chronic condition caused by 
an inflammatory response to seasonal allergens, and is characterized by nasal congestion, 
clear rhinorrhea (runny nose), sneezing, and itching.6–10 Hay fever is frequently under 
recognized, misdiagnosed, and ineffectively treated.11 The causes and triggers of hay fever 
are seasonal exposure to mold or trees, grass and weed pollens.6–10 Previous studies have 
linked rise in ambient temperature with increases in respiratory diseases,12–16 but no studies 
to date have investigated the role of extreme heat events on respiratory outcomes such as hay 
fever on a national scale.
An increasing body of literature suggests that the frequency, intensity, and duration of 
extreme weather events will continue to rise in the near future in response to changing 
climate.17–19 The potential impact of these increases on allergic diseases is a growing 
concern that has not been empirically assessed for the contiguous US. Prior studies have 
shown that increases in temperature and CO2 concentrations affect plant phenology as well 
as concentration, distribution and allergenicity of pollen.20–22 This dynamic may worsen the 
burden of hay fever by increasing both the pollen season length and the potency of 
pollen.22–24 An increased burden may differentially impact people living in urban versus

 rural areas, and those of low socioeconomic status, children, and older adults18, because of 
the urban heat island effect,25 poor housing conditions26 and limited adaptive responses.27
Using 17 years of health outcome data (NHIS 1997–2013; N=505,386 respondents), we 
explored the association between exposures to increased frequency of extreme heat events 
and hay fever among a nationally representative sample of the adult civilian non-
institutionalized US population aged 18 years and older.
Methods
Meteorological data
Daily weather data was obtained from two systems within the National Centers For 
Environmental Information (NCEI)—formerly known as the National Climatic Data Center)
—for the 1960–2013 period.28 Data for the years 1960–2010 were extracted from the 
DSI-3200 data set. The DSI-3200 data set was discontinued in 2010 and replaced with the 
Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN) data set that consists of additional stations 
that are not part of the original DSI-3200 network. Therefore, for the 2011–2013 period, we 
identified the DSI3200 stations within the GHCN network using unique station identification 
and extracted information from this subset of stations to maintain consistency.
Exposure metric
Using daily TMAX for the 1960–1989 reference period, county-specific 30-year baselines 
for each calendar month were computed. Based on the distribution of this data, we identified 
the 95th percentile values of TMAX, referred to as Extreme Temperature Threshold 95th 
percentile (ETT95) as previously described.29 Daily TMAX values for each county were 
compared to their respective calendar-month-specific ETT95 and assigned a value of “1” if 
they exceeded the thresholds, and “0” otherwise. The ETT95 exceedences —referred to as 
extreme heat events (EHE95)— were summed over each calendar month for each county 
during the 1997–2013 period for which NHIS hay fever prevalence data was available.
Extreme heat event values were assigned to individual NHIS records for each survey year in 
two ways: 1) the cumulative number of extreme heat events for the county of residence in a 
12 month window, which include the month of interview and the preceding 11 months; and, 
2) the cumulative number of extreme heat events for the county of residence in each of the 
four complete seasons over the 12-month window preceding the month of interview. Seasons 
were categorized as: Winter – December, January, February; Spring – March, April, May; 
Summer – June, July, August; Fall – September, October, November.
National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), 1997–2013 data
We combined NHIS data for 1997–2013 for this analysis. The NHIS is a nationally 
representative cross-sectional household interview survey of the civilian non-
institutionalized population of the United States that has been conducted since 1957, 
although the survey design and questionnaire have changed over time30. The NHIS is 
conducted continuously throughout the year. Between 1997–2013, about 40,000 households 
were sampled each year, with some households having multiple families. In each family, a

 sample adult is selected for detailed questions on health and health care30. During the 17-
year period, the sample adult response rates ranged from 60.8% to 80.4%.
We used the restricted-use NHIS files geocoded to county FIPS. These files are available 
through the NCHS Research Data Center (RDC). There are 516,140 sample adults 18 years 
of age or older in the 1997–2013 NHIS. Respondents were excluded from the analysis if 
they: 1) resided in a county that had less than 12 months of extreme heat data and had at 
least one non-valid month for the development of the baseline (n=1,185); 2) resided outside 
the 48 contiguous states at the time of the interview (n=5,334); or, 3) had missing data for 
any of the variables used in the analysis (n=4,235), for a total of 10,754 (2%) excluded 
respondents.
Hay fever was identified using responses to the question: “During the past 12 months, have 
you been told by a doctor or other health professional that you had hay fever?” Demographic 
characteristics considered included age (18–34, 35–49, 50–64, 65+ years), race/ethnicity 
(Hispanic, non-Hispanic black, non-Hispanic white, all other races and ethnicities), sex 
(female, male), education level (less than high school/GED, high school/GED, some college, 
Bachelor’s degree, Graduate degree), and family income relative to poverty threshold (less 
than 100%, 100% to less than 200%, 200% to less than 400%, 400% or above the poverty 
threshold)31,32. We used the NHIS multiple-imputed income data to assign poverty status 
level to records with missing values (percent missing ranged from 4.5% to 10.0% over 
1997–2013) using NCHS-recommended methods33.
We also included a county-level geographical covariate describing urban-rural classification 
with four urban and two rural categories (urban: large central, large fringe, medium and 
small metro; rural: micropolitan and non-core).34 Large central metro counties are counties 
in Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) of 1 million or more population that contain the 
largest principal city of the MSA, are contained within the MSA’s largest principal city, or 
contain at least 250,000 residents of any principal city. Large fringe metro counties are 
counties in MSAs of 1 million or more population that do not qualify as large central metro. 
They are considered to be “suburbs” of large cities. Medium and small metro counties are 
counties in MSAs of 250,000–999,999 and less than 250,000 population, respectively. 
Micropolitan and noncore counties are nonmetropolitan counties that are not in MSAs.
Statistical analysis
Associations between annual and seasonal total extreme heat events and adult hay fever 
were evaluated using logistic regression models in SUDAAN which accounts for the 
complex clustered sample design of the NHIS35. Unadjusted and adjusted models were fitted 
separately for each overall annual cumulative lag and seasonal cumulative lag of extreme 
heat events. We fitted additional models for seasonal extreme heat events separately based 
on interview season defined in the description of the survey. The quartiles for overall 
exposure and seasonal exposure were based on the distribution of extreme heat events for all 
3,109 counties in the contiguous United States. Because the actual cutoff point for seasonal 
quartiles varied by season, we decided to use same approximate cutoff for all season to 
maintain comparability.

 RESULTS
Among adults aged 18 years and older, 8.43% (n=42,601) reported being told they had hay 
fever within the previous 12 months for the period 1997 to 2013 (Table I). All characteristics 
shown in Table I, except urban-rural classification, were significantly associated with hay 
fever status. After full adjustment, women have a 30% (OR: 1.30, 95% CI: 1.27–1.33) 
increased odds of being diagnosed with hay fever compared to men. Compared to Hispanics, 
non-Hispanic whites and non-Hispanic blacks have a 44% (OR: 1.44, 95% CI: 1.37–1.33) 
and a 9% (OR: 1.09, 95% CI: 1.03–1.15) increased odds of receiving a hay fever diagnosis. 
Likewise, compared to 18–34 year olds, those in 35–49, 50–64 and >=65 year age groups 
had a 67%, 59%, and a 13% increased odds of receiving a hay fever diagnosis, respectively. 
Also, as education and income increases the odds of hay fever diagnosis increases.
Extreme heat events (approximate quartiles of the cumulative number of extreme heat events 
in the 12 months preceding the survey) were significantly associated with hay fever 
prevalence in an unadjusted analysis (Table II, Model 1). When adjusting for demographic 
characteristics (Table II, Model 2), the association between extreme heat events and hay 
fever persisted, i.e., compared to adults in the lowest quartile of exposure to extreme heat 
events (0 to 10 events), adults in the higher quartiles of exposures had higher odds of 
reporting a diagnosis of hay fever in the previous 12 months. This increase in odds ranged 
from 5% (OR 1.05, 95% CI: 1.01–1.09) for adults in the 2nd quartile to 7% (OR 1.07, 95% 
CI: 1.03–1.11) for adults in the 4th quartile. Additional adjustment for urbanicity did not 
change the observed association (Table II, Model 3).
When we analyzed by timing (season) of extreme heat events, we observed a clear exposure-
response relationship for associations between springtime extreme heat events and odds of 
hay fever (Ptrend <0.01, Table III). For springtime extreme heat events, the increases in odds 
of hay fever ranged from 2% (OR 1.02, 95% CI: 0.98–1.06) for adults in the 2nd quartile to 
7% (OR 1.07, 95% CI: 1.03–1.12) for adults in the 4th quartile (Table III). For extreme heat 
events that occurred during summer and winter, the increases in the odds of hay fever was 
significant only among those in the highest quartile of exposure (Table III). Such 
associations were not observed for extreme heat events that occurred during fall.
Sensitivity analyses using both more liberal (90th percentile threshold) and more 
conservative (99th percentiles threshold) exposure metrics did not alter our overall findings 
related to extreme heat events and hay fever prevalence (Supplementary Tables 1 & 2). 
Additional sensitivity analysis looking at the seasonal differences also showed more 
pronounced and consistent effect associated with springtime extreme heat events 
(Supplementary Table 3). The effects of extreme heat events remained significantly 
associated with hay fever prevalence when all models were additionally adjusted for the 
month or year of interview (data not shown).
Discussion
We evaluated the relationship between exposures to annual and seasonal extreme heat events 
and the prevalence of hay fever among a nationally representative sample of civilian non-

 institutionalized US adults using NHIS data collected between 1997 to 2013. This analysis 
builds upon previous work that has shown an association between increasing temperature 
and longer pollen seasons for important allergens such as ragweed.22,23,36
The present study found a modest positive association between exposures to extreme heat 
events, particularly during spring, and the prevalence of hay fever.. For the extreme heat 
events during summer and fall, findings were significant only among individuals in the 
highest quartile of exposure. Our findings regarding exposures to extreme heat events and 
hay fever prevalence were not substantially affected by adjustment for demographic factors 
and county urbanicity. The magnitude of the association, while small, has implications on a 
population level. That is, while individual clinicians may not observe dramatic increases in 
the number of affected patients, the US burden of hay fever could be significantly affected 
by an increase in extreme heat events. While the exact mechanisms by which long-term 
exposures to extreme heat events increase the risk of hay fever remain unclear, one potential 
explanation is changes in plant phenology. Higher frequency of extreme heat events, 
particularly those occurring in winter and spring season may lead to earlier onset of greening 
and flowering of plants including trees that are major sources of pollen.22,23 This is 
supported by a more recent study that showed the spring flowering taxa encountered the 
most pronounced increasing trend for pollen production compared to other season.37 Earlier 
onset of spring effectively increases the duration of exposure to pollen, which is an 
important risk factor for hay fever.21–23 Others have shown higher pollen production 
associated with warmer temperatures.38,39 Increased frequency of extreme heat events may 
lead to higher concentration of pollen in the environment—in addition to increasing the 
possible duration of exposure.38,40,41 Our findings that show a positive association between 
extreme heat events during winter and spring seasons and hay fever prevalence support the 
aforementioned two hypotheses of longer duration and greater concentration of pollen 
exposure. When temperatures in winter and spring are unusually warm, individuals may 
spend more time outdoors, bringing them in closer contact with outdoor pollen as well as 
other pollutants; however, national patterns of time spent outdoors are unknown.
Regardless of the exact underlying mechanism, our study is the first to link exposures to 
extreme heat events and increased odds of hay fever in the Contiguous US. Previous studies 
have shown that the frequency and intensity of such extreme events are increasing and will 
continue to do so in the coming decades.19 Our data show the potential impact of such 
increases on allergic diseases such as hay fever. Our study relied on a large (n=505,386) 
nationally representative sample of the civilian non-institutionalized US population. Our 
county-specific and calendar month-specific exposure metric generated using the 30-year of 
baseline data (1960–1989) enabled us to focus on changes in frequency of extreme events 
relative to 30-year baseline rather than short-term weather phenomena. Furthermore, we 
were able to control for several socioeconomic characteristics including educational level, 
family income relative to the poverty threshold, and the urban-rural classification of the 
county; but they were not sensitive to further adjustment for region. Finally, we performed 
several sensitivity analyses, which established the robustness of our findings.
Our study also has several limitations. The term hay fever is a lay term used synonymously 
with seasonal allergic rhinitis.10 However, it is unknown how often this term is used for 
Upperman et al.

 general allergic rhinitis, which can include perennial symptoms caused aeorallergens. 
Imprecise use of the term hay fever may be reflected in the NHIS. Furthermore, it is not 
clear if there are cultural, geographic, or other differences in how survey participants use the 
term ‘hay fever,’ and if use of a more general term such as ‘seasonal allergic rhinitis’ would 
have yielded different prevalence estimates. However, the NHIS includes two questions for 
children, one with the term “hay fever” and the other with the term “respiratory allergy,” and 
similar magnitudes of differences by race/ethnicity are observed when responses to both 
questions are combined to estimate overall respiratory allergy (http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/
products/databriefs/db121.htm).
The NHIS is a multipurpose health survey, and as such, lacked information needed to more 
fully examine the effects of extreme heat events on hay fever. For instance, the NHIS survey 
does not collect exact date of onset of outcomes, degree of hay fever symptoms, or clinical 
indicators of allergen sensitization. In addition, we have no information on local pollen 
levels, which may have improved our understanding of the association between extreme heat 
events and reported allergies. From the cross-sectional design of the NHIS we cannot 
establish a clear temporality in exposure to extreme heat event and hay fever, and our results 
may be affected by the length of time between exposure to extreme heat events and the recall 
of hay fever.42 Moreover, hay fever may not capture the full spectrum of seasonal allergic 
rhinitis—a more complete measurement of seasonal respiratory allergies could result in a 
different observed association. Another limitation is the use of county of residence to define 
exposure for the NHIS respondents. However, this likely resulted in non-differential 
measurement error, so the observed associations are an underestimation of the true measure. 
Finally, our study did not include additional risk factors including air pollution and pollen 
measurements in this multidimensional issue involving climate–pollution–allergen effect.43
Conclusions
We investigated the impact of extreme heat events on the prevalence of hay fever among a 
nationally representative sample of the civilian non-institutionalized US population from 
1997 to 2013. We observed a modest, but significant, association between exposures to 
extreme heat events and hay fever prevalence. The findings were more pronounced for 
springtime extreme heat events. Our results provide empirical evidence of how extreme heat 
events, projected to increase in frequency, duration and intensity in the future, adversely 
impact allergic disease among US adults.

1.
What is already known about this topic? Extreme heat events are projected to 
increase in frequency, duration and intensity in coming decades in response to 
changing climate
2.
What does this article add to our knowledge? We show that exposure to 
extreme heat event is associated with increased hay fever prevalence among 
US adults.
3.
How does this study impact current management guidelines? Future clinical 
guidance on allergen avoidance and medication initiation may need to 
consider frequency and timing of extreme heat events.
