IMPORTANCE Recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB) is a devastating, often fatal,
inherited blistering disorder caused by mutations in the COL7A1 gene encoding type VII
collagen. Support and palliation are the only current therapies.
OBJECTIVE To evaluate the safety and wound outcomes following genetically corrected
autologous epidermal grafts in patients with RDEB.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Single-center phase 1 clinical trial conducted in the
United States of 4 patients with severe RDEB with a measured area of wounds suitable for
grafting of at least 100 cm2. Patients with undetectable type VII collagen keratinocyte
expression were excluded.
INTERVENTIONS Autologous keratinocytes isolated from biopsy samples collected from
4 patients with RDEB were transduced with good manufacturing practice–grade retrovirus
carrying full-length human COL7A1 and assembled into epidermal sheet grafts. Type VII
collagen gene–corrected grafts (approximately 35 cm2) were transplanted onto 6 wounds in
each of the patients (n = 24 grafts).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary safety outcomes were recombination
competent retrovirus, cancer, and autoimmune reaction. Molecular correction was assessed
as type VII collagen expression measured by immunofluorescence and immunoelectron
microscopy. Wound healing was assessed using serial photographs taken at 3, 6, and
12 months after grafting.
RESULTS The 4 patients (mean age, 23 years [range, 18-32 years]) were all male with an
estimated body surface area affected with RDEB of 4% to 30%. All 24 grafts were well
tolerated without serious adverse events. Type VII collagen expression at the
dermal-epidermal junction was demonstrated on the graft sites by immunofluorescence
microscopy in 9 of 10 biopsy samples (90%) at 3 months, in 8 of 12 samples (66%) at
6 months, and in 5 of 12 samples (42%) at 12 months, including correct type VII collagen
localization to anchoring fibrils. Wounds with recombinant type VII collagen graft sites
displayed 75% or greater healing at 3 months (21 intact graft sites of 24 wound sites; 87%),
6 months (16/24; 67%), and 12 months (12/24; 50%) compared with baseline wound sites.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this preliminary study of 4 patients with RDEB, there was
wound healing in some type VII collagen gene–corrected grafts, but the response was
variable among patients and among grafted sites and generally declined over 1 year.
Long-term follow-up is necessary for these patients, and controlled trials are needed with a
broader range of patients to better understand the potential long-term efficacy of genetically
corrected autologous epidermal grafts.

R
ecessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB) is a
severe inherited blistering disease characterized by
painful erosions, debilitating scarring, and aggressive
squamous cell carcinoma during early adulthood. In 1999, the
prevalence and incidence of RDEB were estimated to be 0.92
and2.04,respectively,per1millionlivebirths.1Specifictherapy
is lacking and care is purely supportive and palliative.2
Recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa is caused by
loss of function mutations in COL7A1 (NCBI Accession M96984
and D13694), the gene coding for type VII collagen. Type VII
collagen localizes to anchoring fibrils, which stabilize the der-
mal-epidermal basement membrane. Type VII collagen con-
tains a noncollagenous domain 1, a central collagenous do-
main, and a noncollagenous domain 2 that catalyze the
anchoring fibril assembly.3
Allogeneic fibroblast injection,4 bone marrow trans-
plantation,5mesenchymalcells,6,7andskinsubstitutes8-10have
shown variable efficacy and safety for patients with RDEB.
Gene therapy holds potential for the treatment of monogenic
diseases similar to RDEB; however, concerns have been raised
regarding the viral insertion of cancer-promoting therapeu-
tic genes in patients with severe combined immunodefi-
ciency and Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome.11,12 Cutaneous gene
therapy is advantageous because superficial graft sites can be
clinically evaluated and assessed for neoplasms.
Long-term type VII collagen expression in regenerated hu-
man RDEB epidermal xenografts was previously established
using a Moloney leukemia virus–derived retroviral vector
(LZRSE) containing the COL7A1 gene (LZRSE-COL7A1).13 A ret-
roviruswaschosenbecauseofthelargesizeoftheCOL7A1gene
(9 kb) and the high level of viral titers achieved. Moreover,
LZRSE-modified epidermis previously transplanted to 1 pa-
tient with junctional epidermolysis bullosa showed a long du-
rationofexpressionwithoutsafetyissues.14Inlightofthisback-
ground, this study sought to evaluate ex vivo gene transfer of
recombinant type VII collagen grafts onto wounds in patients
with RDEB.
Methods
Study Design and Participants
Single-centerphase1clinicaltrialofpatientswithRDEBgrafted
with type VII collagen gene–corrected autologous keratino-
cytes that were transduced with a retroviral vector contain-
ing the full-length COL7A1 coding sequence. This open-label
trial was approved by the Recombinant DNA Committee in
2007 and later by the US Food and Drug Administration and
theStanfordUniversityinstitutionalreviewboard(protocolap-
pears in Supplement 1).
Patients were aged 18 years or older and clinically diag-
nosed with RDEB with a measured area of wounds suit-
able for grafting of at least 100 cm2. Patients were selected
from review of Stanford University records and other clini-
cian referrals using a screening protocol15 approved by the
Stanford University institutional review board. The pres-
ence of RDEB was confirmed via genetic testing (GeneDx).
Type VII collagen noncollagenous domain 1 expression was
assessed by Western blot of conditioned patient keratino-
cyte medium and indirect immunofluorescence microscopy
of skin biopsy samples. The type VII collagen and anchoring
fibril deficiencies in skin biopsy samples were confirmed by
immunofluorescence microscopy and immunoelectron
microscopy using the LH24 antibody specific to noncollag-
enous domain 2 (eFigure 1 in Supplement 2).
Circulating and tissue-bound immunoreactants (IgG, IgA,
IgM, and C3) were analyzed via immunofluorescence micros-
copy by placing a serum sample on a primate esophagus and
via direct immunofluorescence of patient biopsy sections,
respectively (eMethods in Supplement 2), and by Western
blot. Patients with medical complications, including human
immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis, systemic infection, or
cardiac abnormalities, were excluded. Clinically significant
anemia was treated prior to grafting. Of 38 patients screened,
8 gave consent for the study between October 2013 and
February 2015. Of those patients, 3 did not fulfill a clinical
or molecular phenotype of severe generalized RDEB, and
1 patient died of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma prior
to grafting. Data on 4 patients with at least 12 months of
follow-up are presented.
Study Treatment
Primary autologous patient keratinocytes were cultured from
two 8-mm diameter skin biopsy samples obtained from
unwounded, unscarred skin and transduced with COL7A1-
containing retrovirus (LZRSE-COL7A1). The full-length
COL7A1 complementary DNA expression was controlled
using the Moloney leukemia virus long terminal repeat pro-
moter and then the virus was pseudotyped with a gibbon ape
leukemia virus xenotropic envelope protein prior to grade
stock production using current good manufacturing prac-
tices. Retroviral infection efficiency was determined by
counting the number of type VII collagen expressing cells
(mean and range of 4 fields).
Proviral genome per cell was assayed using quantitative
polymerase chain reaction (3 replicates shown) and illustrated
using GraphPad. Eight type VII collagen gene–corrected
grafts were produced from transduced patient keratinocytes.
After approximately 25 days, patients returned for grafting
Key Points
Question Can gene therapy be safely used to restore type VII
collagen expression to recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa
(RDEB) wounds?
Findings In this phase 1 clinical trial, autologous RDEB
keratinocytes transduced with a retroviral vector containing
full-length human COL7A1 were assembled into epidermal sheet
grafts and applied to 6 wounds on 4 patients. All grafts were well
tolerated without serious adverse events. Some but not all grafts
showed improved wound healing as well as type VII collagen
expression in anchoring fibrils at the dermal-epidermal basement
membrane.
Meaning Autologous type VII collagen gene–corrected grafts may
have potential in the molecular and clinical correction of RDEB skin.

under general anesthesia. Six grafts were applied to unin-
fected, eroded, or scarred wound sites that lacked clinical
evidence of squamous cell carcinoma. Graft sites were
selected based on the patient’
s choice for quality of life, ease
of immobilization after grafting, and accessibility during gen-
eral anesthesia.
Wound beds were cauterized to minimize retained epi-
dermal stem cells. Five wounds and 1 induced wound (site Z)
were grafted on each patient. The induced wounds (site Z)
were created by rubbing normal-appearing unscarred skin.
Type VII collagen gene–corrected grafts were affixed to the
wound beds via dissolvable sutures after preparation of the
wound bed. Patients 3 and 4 consented to have small india
ink tattoos placed at each graft corner to help track graft loca-
tion. Grafts were covered with nonadhesive dressings and
topical mupirocin for 5 to 7 days after grafting.
Safety End Points and Assessments
The primary safety outcomes were recombinant viral infec-
tion, cancer, and autoimmune reaction. Presence of recom-
binant retrovirus in serum samples was evaluated at 3,
6, and 12 months (clinical protocol for stopping guide-
lines appear in eMethods in Supplement 2) using quantita-
tive polymerase chain reaction for the gibbon ape leukemia
virus sequence (Indiana University Vector Production
Facility), with a detection limit of 10 copies per 0.2 μg of
DNA. Cytotoxic T cells specific for type VII collagen were
assayed using counts of TH1 (IFN-γ) and TH2 (IL-4) (ELISPOT
assay).
At each study visit, blood was collected for complete
blood count, complete metabolic panel, and evaluation of
circulating basement membrane zone–reactive antibodies
by immunofluorescence microscopy. Immune response to
type VII collagen was assessed by immunofluorescence
microscopy by placing a serum sample on a primate esopha-
gus and via direct immunofluorescence of patient biopsy
sections to detect circulating and tissue-bound immunore-
actants (IgG, IgA, IgM, and C3), respectively (eMethods), and
by Western blot. All adverse events were characterized
according to version 3.0 of the National Cancer Institute
common terminology criteria for adverse events.
Type VII collagen expression was assessed by immuno-
fluorescence microscopy or immunoelectron microscopy on
graft biopsy samples, and by level of wound healing in graft
sites at 3, 6, and 12 months after transplantation using an in-
vestigator global score. Wounds were scored by rating the
wound site as 100% to 75% healed, 74% to 50% healed, 49%
to 25% healed, or 24% or less healed compared with baseline
by 2 independent investigators and with the Canfield Vectra
camera (eMethods in Supplement 2).
Secondary outcomes included laboratory abnormalities,
investigator assessment of biopsy sites, and graft dimen-
sions. Representative graft sites were biopsied at each visit
to evaluate type VII collagen expression by immunofluores-
cence microscopy and type VII collagen ultrastructural
localization by immunoelectron microscopy (eMethods in
Supplement 2). The timing, order, and patient assignment
for the assessed photographs were not blinded. This was a
deviation from the protocol to detect early squamous cell
carcinoma and other adverse events at the graft site.
Results
Patients and Treatment
Allpatientsweremale,withameanageof23years(range,18-32
years),withanestimatedbodysurfaceareaaffectedwithRDEB
ranging from 4% to 30%. Each patient was diagnosed clini-
cally as having generalized severe (Hallopeau-Siemens type)
RDEB and demonstrated hallmarks of this RDEB subtype, in-
cluding anemia, esophageal strictures, and pseudosyndac-
tyly (Table 1).
Four adult patients with RDEB received transplants with
type VII collagen gene–corrected grafts (eFigure 2 in Supple-
ment 2). Patients carried various compound heterozygous
COL7A1 mutations causing truncated type VII collagen
expression (noncollagenous domain 1) as detected in a kerati-
nocyte medium by Western blot (eFigure 3), but not in tissue
by immunofluorescence microscopy (Figure 1 and Figure 2
and eFigure 4).
The biopsy sites used for graft production completely
healed in all instances without complications. Primary RDEB
keratinocytes were transduced with the LZRSE-COL7A1 ret-
roviral vector containing full-length COL7A1 sequence and the
long terminal repeat promoter (representative images from pa-
tient 1 in Figure 3) with a mean of 70% efficiency and 0.8 pro-
viral genome copies per cell (shown for all 4 patients in
Figure 4). Wounds were not induced in any of the biopsy or
harvest sites. Most grafted chronic wounds were present for
more than 5 years (Figure 5). All 24 type VII collagen gene–
corrected grafts were serially monitored for the percentage of
wound healing, infection, pain, and pruritus. Patients re-
ceived standard of care treatments as needed during this trial
(eg, transfusions, esophageal dilations).
Safety
No serious adverse events were reported. Graft site pruritus
(n = 3) and increased graft site drainage (n = 2) were the most
common adverse events (grade 1 or 2), and no clinical signs of
malignancy were noted. Recombinant retrovirus and cyto-
toxic T-cell assays were negative for the majority of time points
(Table 2); a minority were undetermined. At 6 months, site Z
for patient 3 had wound colonization (grade 2) and was con-
sidered a graft failure.
Type VII collagen immune responses were monitored,
and no patient showed systemic autoimmune symptoms
or increased blistering outside grafted areas. To reduce the
number of biopsies and to preserve graft tissues, not all
wound sites were biopsied during every visit. In patient 1,
no circulating or tissue-bound antibodies were detected
(Table 2). Patient 2 showed transient tissue-bound antibod-
ies (mild; >1 subclass of IgG and IgM at the dermal-epidermal
junction) without complement fixation at 3 months or circu-
lating type VII collagen antibodies. Patient 3 showed tran-
sient tissue-bound antibodies without circulating type VII
collagen antibodies.

In contrast, patient 4 demonstrated a 1:160 titer dermal-
epidermal junction binding IgG antibodies at 1 and 3 months
and 1 to greater than 2 subclasses of IgG, IgA, C3, and IgM
tissue–bound antibody staining at 3 months (Table 2). How-
ever, no systemic autoimmune symptoms or increased blis-
tering outside the graft sites were noted and the type VII
collagen-specific cytotoxic T-cell assay results were nega-
tive. At 6 months, circulating antibodies and complement
levels were reduced (1:40) in patient 4, with no tissue-bound
immune complexes detected within the graft sites. At 12
months, no circulating or tissue-bound antibodies were seen
in patient 4.
After detection of dermal-epidermal junction–bound im-
munoreactants in patient 4, baseline serum samples of anti–
type VII collagen antibodies were reassessed using Western
blot. In contrast to the negative baseline immunofluores-
cence microscopy results, Western blot analysis showed that
serum samples from both baseline (1:300) and 3 months after
grafting (1:1000) were reactive to purified type VII collagen,
indicating patient 4 was sensitized to exogenous type VII col-
lagen prior to graft placement (eFigure 5 in Supplement 2). Pa-
tient 4’
s serum anti–type VII collagen antibody reactivity was
confirmedwithinapreviouslycharacterizedcarboxylterminal–
type VII collagen pepsin fragment16 both before and after graft
placement.
Findings Following Intervention
Type VII collagen expression was detected in 9 of 10 biopsy
samples (90%) at 3 months, in 8 of 12 samples (66%) at 6
months, and in 5 of 12 samples (40%) at 12 months. Immuno-
fluorescence microscopy analysis of graft sites showed type
VII collagen localization at the dermal-epidermal junction
(Figure 1 and Figure 2 and eFigure 4B in Supplement 2) in con-
trast to uncorrected skin controls. Gene-corrected graft sites
showed fully differentiated epidermis with spinous and granu-
lar layers, which were positive for epidermal markers keratin
14, keratin 1, and loricrin resembling normal skin (eFigure 4B).
This demonstrated that type VII collagen overexpression did
not inhibit epidermal differentiation.
Among the negative samples, type VII collagen was un-
detectable in patient 2’
s biopsy samples at 6 and 12 months;
however, anchoring fibrils were present in a parallel biopsy
sample obtained at 6 months (Figure 1). In patient 3 at 12
months and in patient 4 at 6 and 12 months, type VII collagen
was identified using noncollagenous domain 1–specific anti-
bodies (Figure 2).
At 3 months, 5 of 7 biopsy samples (71%) showed a mor-
phologically normal appearance and a frequency of anchor-
ing fibrils that were reactive with type VII collagen noncollag-
enous domain 2 antibody. At 6 months, anchoring fibrils
were detected in 4 of 12 biopsy samples (33%), but were not

Discussion
One main challenge to RDEB genetic correction has been the
efficient delivery of the large COL7A1 complementary DNA
transgene, encompassing greater than 9 kb. To our knowl-
edge, this study represents the first human trial of cutane-

ous gene therapy using autologous type VII collagen gene–
corrected grafts for wound healing. These findings suggest
acceptable safety in 4 patients with severe generalized
RDEB. Genetically corrected keratinocytes regenerated
functional, self-renewing epidermis in 67% of graft sites
tested at 6 months after grafting with type VII collagen or
morphologically normal anchoring fibrils detectable up to 1
year for 3 patients (Figure 1 and Figure 2). These results are
an improvement compared with previous studies of nonge-
netically modified allogenic keratinocyte grafts in which only
22% (2/9) chronic wounds showed healing at 18 weeks.9
Neither allogeneic fibroblast injections4,17 (despite some
initial improvement in wound healing) nor intradermal or
intravenous injections of bone marrow–derived mesenchy-
mal stem cells6,7 showed long-term differences compared
with placebo. A case report of a similar gene therapy using
similar methods for 1 patient with junctional epidermolysis
bullosa and palm-derived keratinocytes (as a rich stem cell
source) demonstrated a 6-year gene correction.14,18
In the current trial, 12 months of continued type VII colla-
gen expression was detected in gene-corrected graft sites,
corresponding to approximately 10 epidermal turnover
cycles. This suggests the current intervention successfully
targeted keratinocyte stem cells; however, a general decrease
in wound healing at graft sites was observed at 1 year. This
could be attributed to the reduced number of stem cells in
biopsy samples from patients with RDEB due to unavailabil-
ity of unscarred palm skin for biopsy (due to pseudosyndac-
tyly) or uncorrected cells in the wound bed may have com-
peted with corrected cells within the graft.
In this study, wound healing was accompanied by full-
length type VII collagen expression in the dermal-epidermal
basement membrane. Wound healing was also associated
with the formation of anchoring fibrils that were not present
prior to grafting. During the critical first few days of graft
placement, some graft sites were difficult to immobilize,
including the back and posterior shoulder of patient 2. This
patient also had the shortest period of immobilization after
transplantation compared with the other study participants
(Table 1). It is possible these factors could have reduced
wound healing overall and may explain the absence of
detectable type VII collagen by indirect immunofluores-
cence microscopy in biopsies sampled at 6 and 12 months in
patient 2. Patients 1 and 2 were brothers, further implicating
external rather than genetic factors in their graft outcome
differences.
Few adverse safety events were reported. No evidence
of recombinant retrovirus in blood or squamous cell carci-
noma at graft sites were seen to date; however, long-term
monitoring will continue for 5 years. All molecular replace-
ment approaches pose the risk of unwanted immune
responses against the therapeutic product, particularly in
patients with null mutations. In this trial, all patients
expressed a nonfunctional truncated type VII collagen mol-
ecule containing the noncollagenous domain 1, which is
believed to be the most antigenic portion of the protein,19
and may be responsible for minimizing the risk of potential
immune reaction. No evidence of type VII collagen–
associated cytotoxic T-cell activity was seen in any patients
during the study.

However, immunofluorescence microscopy and direct
immunofluorescence studies in patient 4 revealed transient
tissue-bound antibodies and circulating antibodies (Table 2).
Patient 4 was later found to have had anti-type VII collagen
antibodies prior to transplantation (as detected using a
more sensitive Western blot analysis) that were not identified
during the screening process with a immunofluorescence mi-
croscopy assay certified by the Clinical Laboratory Improve-
ment Amendments, suggesting that more sensitive standard-
ized methods should be developed to assess baseline immune
cross-reactivity in future therapeutic studies. Altering colla-
gen isoform balance in the skin remains a theoretical con-
cern; however, extensive dermatological experience at inject-
ing collagen I and III into human skin over many years has not
proven deleterious in this regard.
Limitations of this phase 1 trial included results on only 4
patients and a 12-month follow-up period. Wounds were mea-
sured using a categorical assessment of wound healing as de-
termined by 2 independent investigators. Although there were
no disagreements between the investigators scoring the level
of wound healing, this RDEB global score has not been for-
mally validated. Because this study focused on safety, photo-
graphicassessmentsofwoundswerenotblindedtodetectpos-
sible adverse events, such as squamous cell carcinoma, and
there was not a systematic comparison with untreated wounds
due to a limited number of available patients with paired
chronic wounds.
Clinicaloutcomeswerebasedonaper-graftresponserather
than a per-patient response because there were intraindi-
vidual characteristics, such as graft location, that affected the
successofgrafting.Attachmentandprotectionofthegraftdur-
ing the initial 2 weeks has been shown to be the most impor-
tant factor in graft survival and wound healing.
Another limitation is that the trial included only a subset
of patients with RDEB who had noncollagenous domain 1 and
it is not known what the response would be in a broader group.
In general, clinical wound healing accompanied type VII col-
lagen expression; however, only a small portion (3- to 4-mm

Given the greater than 1-year follow-up for 4 patients
without significant adverse events, the Food and Drug
Administration has allowed initiation of a phase 2A trial
(NCT01263379) that is enrolling adolescents aged 13 years or
older and will focus on quantitative wound outcome
measurements compared with untreated wounds and other
clinical outcomes, such as wound pain and itch.
Conclusions
In this preliminary study of 4 patients with RDEB, there was
woundhealinginsometypeVIIcollagengene–correctedgrafts,
but the response was variable among patients and among
grafted sites and generally declined over 1 year. Long-term
follow-up is necessary for these patients, and controlled trials
are needed with a broader range of patients to better under-
stand the potential long-term efficacy of genetically cor-
rected autologous epidermal grafts.
