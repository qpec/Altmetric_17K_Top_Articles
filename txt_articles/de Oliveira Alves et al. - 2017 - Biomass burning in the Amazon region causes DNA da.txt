Most of the studies on air pollution focus on emissions from fossil fuel burning in urban centers. 
However, approximately half of the world's population is exposed to air pollution caused by biomass 
burning emissions. In the Brazilian Amazon population, over 10 million people are directly exposed to 
high levels of pollutants resulting from deforestation and agricultural fires. This work is the first study to 
present an integrated view of the effects of inhalable particles present in emissions of biomass burning. 
Exposing human lung cells to particulate matter smaller than 10 µm (PM10), significantly increased 
the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS), inflammatory cytokines, autophagy, and DNA damage. 
Continued PM10 exposure activated apoptosis and necrosis. Interestingly, retene, a polycyclic aromatic 
hydrocarbon present in PM10, is a potential compound for the effects of PM10, causing DNA damage and 
cell death. The PM10 concentrations observed during Amazon biomass burning were sufficient to induce 
severe adverse effects in human lung cells. Our study provides new data that will help elucidate the 
mechanism of PM10-mediated lung cancer development. In addition, the results of this study support 
the establishment of new guidelines for human health protection in regions strongly impacted by 
biomass burning.
Most of the overwhelming amount of research on exposure to air pollution is focused on urban centers and on 
the role of fossil fuels as the most important source of atmospheric pollutants. However, approximately 3 billion 
people in the world are exposed to air pollution from biomass burning, originating from using wood or coal as 
cooking fuel in simple stoves, home heating with open fires, deforestation, and agricultural practices1.
Biomass burning emits significant quantities of known pollutants hazardous to health, including several car-
cinogenic compounds2. World Health Organization (WHO) reported that in 2012, approximately 7 million peo-
ple - one in eight total global deaths - as a result of exposure to air pollution3. Fire is a global phenomenon, and is 
an integral part of the earth’s ecosystem4, 5.
In particular, the Brazilian Amazon region contains world’s largest tropical forest and is considered, during the 
rainy season, one of the continental regions least affected by human activities6, 7. However, during the dry season, 
high concentrations of aerosol particles from biomass burning (mainly agricultural practices and deforestation) 
have been documented in this region7, 8. The combination of forest fires and human occupation has turned bio-
mass burning into a serious public health threat. The majority of forest fires occur in the deforestation arc, a belt 
in the southern and western regions of the forest, directly impacting over 10 million people in the area9. Many

studies in the area have identified severe effects on human health, such as increased incidences of asthma, mor-
bidity and mortality, mainly in the most vulnerable populations such as children and elderly10, 11.
The smoke plume extends over millions of km2, covering large areas of South America, with significant health 
impacts extending far from the Amazon region12, 13. A recent study has estimated that reduction in the rate of 
deforestation in the Amazon in previous years has been preventing approximately 400 to 1,700 premature adult 
deaths annually, throughout South America13.
Studies show that inhabitants in the deforestation arc breathe air with high concentrations of particulate mat-
ter smaller than 10 µm (PM10). The problem is aggravated during the dry season, when high concentrations of 
PM10 have been measured (ranging from 400 up to 600 µg.m−
3)14, exceeding the upper limits of concentration 
established by WHO (24 h exposure to PM10 – 50 µg.m−
3) by 8 to 12 times. These inhalable particles have been 
classified as class 1 cancer-causing agents in 2013 by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC)15. 
They can penetrate the alveolar regions of the lung, pass through the cell membrane, reach the blood and can 
accumulate in other human organs16.
Although epidemiological studies on the effects of urban PM on human health are numerous, there are rel-
atively few that focused on the impact of air pollution resulting from biomass burning2, 17. Even scarcer are the 
studies that investigate the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying PM toxicity. In one of these studies, 
Borgie and collaborators observed that PM increased the histone H2AX phosphorylation (γ
-H2AX) (a DNA 
damage marker), telomerase activity, and induced epigenetic changes in bronchial epithelial cells18. Several 
groups reported that PM induces cell cycle alterations19, oxidative stress20, 21 and cell death22. Most of these stud-
ies focused on PM in urban areas. Recently, our group showed that organic PM10 in Amazon biomass burning 
emissions had mutagenic effect on plant cells and human lung cells23, 24. The objective of the present study was to 
investigate these effects in depth and provide a thorough analysis of the toxic cellular and molecular effects of rel-
evant concentrations of PM10 resulting from Amazon biomass burning, on human lung. In fact, this manuscript 
is a sequel to an article published recently by our group characterizing in detail the chemical composition of the 
inhalable material whose health effects are investigated here25.
Our findings raise concern regarding human health of affected people, since we investigated the effects of PM 
on human lung cells using concentrations within plausible range of in vitro assays.
Results
PM10 from Amazon region reduces cell viability and increases ROS generation in human lung 
cells. 
We first evaluated the viability of human lung epithelial cells (A549 cell line) exposed to 200 and 400 
µg.mL−
1 of organic PM10 (Fig. 1A). There was no significant difference in the viability of cells exposed to PM10 
for 24 h compared to that of untreated cells (Fig. 1A). However, significant loss of viability was observed in cells 
exposed to 400 µg.mL−
1 of PM10 for 72 h (Fig. 1B). We also evaluated the cytotoxicity of retene (RET) (Fig. 1A 
and B). The concentration of RET used in this study was 30 ng.mL−
1, which corresponds to the contribution of 
RET to the organic PM extract at 400 µg.mL−
1. Our data showed that treatment with this compound for 72 h was 
cytotoxic to human lung cells (Fig. 1B). Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were used as positive control 
(10 ng.mL−
1) for cytotoxicity analysis (Fig. 1A and B)24.
Since PM collected with different source characteristics was implicated in ROS generation26, 27, we investi-
gated the ROS levels in A549 cells exposed to PM10. Intracellular ROS generation was significantly higher in 
cells exposed to PM10 for 24 and 72 h compared to the control cells (Fig. 1C and D). The effect was also dose and 
time-dependent. In particular, there was an 8.6-fold increase in fluorescence intensity in cells treated with PM10 
for 72 h (Fig. 1D).
Mitochondrial superoxide indicator (MitoSOX) was used to evaluate the possible involvement of mitochon-
dria in ROS formation. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that treatment with organic PM10 (200 and 400 μ
g.mL−
1) 
markedly increased mitochondrial ROS generation in A549 cells in a dose and time-dependent manner, starting 
just after 24 h (Fig. 1E), and continuing till after exposure 72 h, specially at the higher concentration (Fig. 1F). 
These data suggest an important role of mitochondria in ROS generation upon exposure to PM10.
PM10 induces the secretion of inflammatory cytokines by human lung cells. 
Since PM10 known 
is to induce the secretion of inflammatory cytokines28, 29, we next investigated the concentrations of TNF-α
 and 
IL−
1β
 in the culture media of cells exposed to PM10. IL-1β
 levels were significantly elevated in cells treated with 
200 or 400 μ
g.mL−
1 of PM10, for 24 or 72 h, in comparison to those in control cultures (Fig. 2A and B). Similar 
results were observed for TNF-α
 (Fig. 2C and D), indicating the induction of pro-inflammatory response in 
human lung cells exposed to PM10.
PM10 induces autophagosome accumulation. 
The increase in ROS generation prompted us to investi-
gate autophagy30, a pathway that is induced by ROS and also can mitigate the generation of ROS. For investigating 
the autophagy response, we chose 400 μ
g.mL−
1 of PM10 concentration, since this dose caused a more dramatic 
increase in ROS levels after 72 h treatment (Fig. 1D and F). As shown in Fig. 3A,B and C, the number of A549 
cells engaged in autophagy (as measured by the formation of cytoplasmic, fluorescent round-shape GFP-LC3 
structures) increased after exposure to 400 μ
g.mL−
1 of PM10 in a time-dependent manner.
To confirm these results, we measured, by western blotting, the conversion of unprocessed cytosolic LC3-I to 
the LC3-II (autophagosome-associated) form, following PM10 treatment. Our results show an increase in LC3-II 
in A549 cells exposed to 200 and 400 μ
g.mL−
1 of PM10 for 24 h, demonstrating LC3-processing (Fig. 3D). These 
results confirmed that PM10 exposure induced autophagy in A549 cells.
PM10 induces DNA damage and cell cycle alterations in human lung cells. 
An increase in ROS 
levels can result in DNA damage and mutagenesis31. Therefore, we evaluated the induction of DNA lesions using

comet assay. Analysis was performed 24 h after treatment with PM10 since, at later time points, DNA fragmen-
tation induced by cell death could interfere with the results. Results of this analysis showed that organic PM10 
induced significant DNA damage, as evidenced by tail formation at all doses tested. We used the PAHs mix as 
positive control in this experiment and confirmed its genotoxic effect (Fig. 4A). We also assessed the genotoxic 
potential of RET, since there are very few studies investigating the genetic damage caused by this compound

generated during biomass combustion. RET induced DNA damage in human lung cells, and the difference in the 
extent of damage between treatment group and negative control was significant (Fig. 4A).
Additionally, we evaluated the formation of γ
-H2AX, a widely used DNA damage marker32. The nuclei of 
human lung cells exposed to PM10 for 24 h stained positive for γ
-H2AX, although the degree of staining was not 
significant. The number of γ
-H2AX-positive cells increased in a time and dose-dependent manner, and a signif-
icant increase in γ
-H2AX formation in A549 cells was observed at higher concentration of PM10 (400 µg.mL−
1) 
after 72 h treatment (Fig. 4B).
We then investigated whether these inhalable particles can alter the cell cycle of human lung cells. Figure 5A 
shows the cell cycle profile of the A549 cells exposed to organic PM10 for 24 h. The results showed an increase 
in the number of cells in G1 phase, although only in cells treated with 400 μ
g.mL−
1 of PM10, consistent with the 
induction of γ
-H2AX formation at this dose.
The mechanism underlying the cell cycle alterations was investigated by analyzing the expression of two key 
proteins, p53 and p21, by western blotting. There was an increase in the levels of these proteins in cells treated 
with organic PM10 for 24 h (Fig. 5B), suggesting that DNA damage induced by PM10 leads to cell cycle alterations.
PM10 induces apoptosis and necrosis in human lung cells. 
We, next investigated if PM10 can induce 
cell death in human lung cells, possibly as a consequence of DNA damage. For these assays, we chose the highest 
concentration of organic PM10 (400 µg.mL−
1) used in this study.
To evaluate the cell death response precisely, we quantified the sub-G1 cell population, which represents cells 
with fragmented nuclei, an indicator of apoptosis induction33. After 72 h exposure to organic PM10, we detected 
an increase in sub-G1 cells (Fig. 6A). To complement this analysis, we stained the cells with PI and Hoescht, and 
observed nuclear morphology, as well as PI uptake, using a fluorescence microscope. Figure 6B shows the occur-
rence of early (6.8%) and late apoptosis (10%), as well as necrosis (30.8%) after 72 h continuous treatment with 
PM10. Interesting, the RET induced cell death mainly by necrosis in human lung cells with a significant difference 
compared to negative control.
Based on these results, we hypothesized that the DNA fragmentation that occurs during apoptosis increases 
the levels of γ
-H2AX staining. Therefore, we analyzed the active caspase-3 content, concomitantly with γ
-H2AX 
staining and observed a clear association between these two markers (Fig. 6C). To validate these results, we per-
formed this assay with ultraviolet-C (UVC) light, which induces two types of γ
-H2AX staining, moderate and

high. Only the latter correlates with cell death34. Strikingly, PM-induced γ
-H2AX differs from that induced by 
UVC, and is exclusively related to apoptosis (Figure S1).
Discussion
It is well recognized that PM from urban air pollution induces lung cancer15. However, the exact mechanisms 
underlying this effect are still unclear. The present study revealed that the PM10 emitted during biomass burning 
in the Amazon region caused toxic effects at molecular and cellular levels in human lung cells. Here, we present 
for the first time, an integrated analysis of the effects of particulate emissions from the forest fires of Amazonian 
deforestation arc, on oxidative stress, inflammatory response, autophagy induction, cell cycle arrest, DNA dam-
age, and cell death of human lung cells. It has been proposed that these pathways represent important toxicolog-
ical mechanisms associated with PM-induced lung cancer35, 36.
It is clear that the effects of PM depend, not only on the particle size, but also on the composition of PM. The 
identification of all the toxic components within the PM ensemble is an extremely challenging task, given the

complexity of the composition and number of compounds37. PAHs are known to be largely responsible for the 
toxicity of PM generated from a variety of sources15, 38. An earlier study quantified the PAH content in the organic 
extract used in this study, identifying that 40% of these compounds were known carcinogens25. One key com-
pound identified in this work was dibenzo[a,h]anthracene. Another study of our group, focusing on nitrated and

oxygenated PAHs (de Oliveira Galvão, manuscript accepted)39, also established the contribution of nitrated and 
oxygenated-PAHs to human carcinogenic risk from the same material, indicating the identity of the components 
responsible for the effects studied here.
We investigated in vitro, the effects of PM10 on human lung cells using concentrations within the plausible 
range. Our results show that ROS generation occurs as an early event. We hypothesized that ROS-dependent 
oxidative stress caused by PM10 would lead to the release of inflammatory cytokines. Consistent with the results 
of previous studies, organic fractions from urban emissions40, 41 and wildfire emissions42, 43 strongly induced the 
secretion of IL-1β
 and TNF-α
. In addition, the impact of long-range transport episodes of wildfire smoke was 
investigated in the mouse cell line, RAW 264.7. The cytokine production observed in this study44 was substantially 
lower, compared to that induced by corresponding particles of the seasonal average period. It is suggested that 
this reduction could be due to the chemical transformation of the organic fraction during aging44. Besides, it is 
interesting to note that 1-nitropyrene, a compound identified in the PM extract used here (de Oliveira Galvão, 
manuscript accepted)39, induced oxidative DNA damage by generation of ROS in A549 cells45, which may explain 
the previously identified mutagenic and carcinogenic potential of this compound46.
Moreover, mitochondria are also responsible for the increase in ROS, as evidenced by the formation of sig-
nificant quantities of mitochondrial superoxide after exposure to PM10. An earlier study showed the involve-
ment of mitochondria in ROS production in rat alveolar type II and human lung cells exposed to urban PM47. 
Interestingly, in another study using urban pollution samples, low dose PM increased ROS production in bron-
chial epithelial cells, but not the formation of mitochondrial superoxide. Thus, besides superoxide, those other 
mitochondria-independent pathways may also drive ROS generation in certain cell types19.
Several studies have reported that polycyclic aromatic quinones cause severe adverse biological 
effects such as allergic inflammation via induction of the ROS pathway48–50. Shang et al.26, for example, 
showed that some quinones (1,2-naphthoquinone, 2-methylanthraquinone, 9,10-phenanthrenequinone, 
2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone, and acenaphthenequinone) caused viability decrease, cellular LDH release, DNA 
damage and ROS production in A549 cells. Correspondingly, 2-methylanthraquinone was the most abundant 
compound among oxygenated-PAHs in our samples (de Oliveira Galvão, manuscript accepted)39. Therefore, it is 
likely that this compound also contributed significantly, because of its high redox potency, to the adverse health 
effects reported here.
Furthermore, excessive levels of ROS can cause severe damage to DNA and proteins. In this respect, auto-
phagy has been conventionally considered a pathway that is activated in response to these insults, to maintain 
cellular homeostasis51. Our results clearly showed the accumulation of autophagosomes in PM10-treated cells. In 
agreement, Deng and collaborators showed that PM-induced oxidative stress probably plays a key role in auto-
phagy induction in A549 cells (same cellular model used in this work), which may contribute to PM-induced 
impairment of pulmonary function52. These authors also reported that PM could elicit oxidative stress by decreas-
ing the activity of antioxidant enzymes activity, finally leading to cell death52.
Another interesting finding of this study was the cell cycle arrest at G1-phase and formation of DNA strand 
breaks in response to PM10 treatment. In this context, Longhin and collaborators showed that PM altered cell 
cycle significantly in the human epithelial cells just after 3 h of exposure19. DNA damage has also been reported 
to result from exposure to PM in coke oven53, vehicular54, and industrial emissions55. Different mechanisms 
have been proposed to explain these effects, such as DNA strand breaks caused by the oxidative stress exerted by 
different agents (including PAHs)56 and formation of bulky DNA adducts by the direct action of reactive PAHs57.
An appropriate response of cells to DNA damage involves activation of checkpoint proteins that regulate cell 
cycle progression. In fact, we noticed an increase in the expression of p53 and its downstream target, p21, which is 
capable of inducing cell cycle arrest. This is an early event after PM10 treatment. Similarly, a recent study reported 
that urban PM induced G1 arrest in alveolar epithelial cells with p21 playing a critical role in the regulation of cell 
cycle and preventing apoptosis58. These effects have been observed when the cells were exposed to carcinogenic 
PAHs. For example, dibenzo[a,l]pyrene and benzo[a]pyrene are able to induce the formation of DNA adducts, 
increases in the levels of p53 and p21, and G1 or G2/M arrests in human mammary carcinoma cells (MCF-7)59.
These early responses are not sufficient to counteract the DNA damage effects, if the exposure to PM10 con-
tinues, which will lead to the activation of cell death processes. Our results showed cell death by apoptosis and 
necrosis after 72 h of exposure to PM10. Interestingly, we observed a positive correlation between the activation 
of caspase-3, an apoptosis protease effector, and γ
-H2AX formation, probably due to apoptotic DNA fragmenta-
tion60. A previous study also reported that urban aerosols during a biomass burning episode in Indonesia caused 
cell death in A549 cells and that this effect could be related to the cytotoxic effects of metals and PAHs contained 
in the ambient PM61.
Real-world biomass burning emissions contain myriad compounds, including those recognized as carcino-
genic and toxic. These compounds were also present in the PM samples used in this study. Nonetheless, there 
are many other compounds whose health effects have not yet been studied. For example, RET is a PAH normally 
associated with wood combustion62 and was present in high concentrations in the samples used in this study25. 
RET has not been included in the risk assessment of PAHs by US-EPA63. Given its high concentrations in the 
Amazon samples, we decided to investigate its genotoxic effect. We found that it is highly genotoxic, and also 
caused cell death by necrosis. These results provide new evidence for the effect of RET on human health, espe-
cially in regions impacted by biomass burning. Further studies focusing on the role of RET in lung cancer devel-
opment are therefore strongly encouraged.
Considering all these data together, we propose a mechanism of action of PM10 present in the emissions from 
biomass burning in the Amazon region, in human lung cells (Fig. 7). DNA damage is an early molecular hallmark 
of exposure to PM. Organic matter present in PM10 extracts can transpose human lung cells and generate oxida-
tive stress by mitochondrial ROS generation. ROS induces cytokine release contributing to the oxidative stress, 
leading to DNA damage. This situation can activate autophagy for reestablishing normal cellular homeostasis as

well as causing cell cycle arrest for dealing with this damage. If the cells are not able to counteract these effects, cell 
death pathways are activated, increasing DNA fragmentation by apoptosis and also necrosis. DNA fragmentation 
also induces the formation of γ
-H2AX. The resultant loss of cells may explain some acute effects of respiratory 
diseases. However, if the cells are not able to deal with DNA damage and not progress to cell death, mutagenesis 
can occur leading to the development of lung cancer64.
Figure 7. Proposed mechanism of action of PM10 from biomass burning emissions in the Amazon region. 
As early events, formation of DNA strand breaks, increased production of ROS and cytokines, mitochondrial 
alterations, and autophagy could be observed clearly. PM10 also caused G1 cell cycle arrest and an increase in 
the expression of p53 and p21 proteins. In the event of continued exposure, this early response is not sufficient 
to counteract the effects of PM10. During late events, both apoptosis and necrosis are activated. DNA fragmen-
tation induces γ
-H2AX formation. The genetic instability driving tumorigenesis is fueled by DNA damage that 
can cause molecular alterations (e.g., mutations) and can play an important role in lung cancer development.To 
summarize, this study investigated the acknowledged adverse health effects of deforestation fires in the Amazon 
Basin, using several analytical techniques. The PM in the emissions from biomass burning in the Amazon region 
has been observed to cause DNA damage and cell death. The results described here could be used for detailed 
chemical speciation, which will provide clues to compounds involved in the negative health effects. Our study 
provides new data on the mechanism of action of PM10 in contributing to the development of lung cancer. A 
better understanding of the pathways by which particulate pollutants contribute to the burden of lung diseases, is 
an important step in reducing the risk of adverse respiratory effects resulting from exposure to biomass burning 
emissions and to develop individual and community-level interventions. It is also an important contribution 
to the establishment of new guidelines for human health protection in regions strongly impacted by biomass 
burning.

extracted as previously described25. The organic extract was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and was 
used for cell treatment.
Cell culture, PM10 treatment and cell proliferation assay. 
A549 cells were routinely grown at 37 °C, in 
a humidified 5% CO2 in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM) containing phenol red and supplemented 
with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and antibiotics (0.1 mg.mL−
1 penicillin, 0.1 mg.mL−
1 streptomycin and 0.25 
mg.mL−
1 fungizone).
Human lung cells were exposed to organic PM10 (200 µg.mL−
1 and 400 µg.mL−
1). It is important to note that, 
despite allowing detailed analysis, in vitro cell exposure studies require pre-treatment of inhalable material such 
as liquid extraction and thus could limit/modify the effects of real-world exposure.
The exposure doses to be used in the present study were difficult to determine, since there were no previous 
studies on the in vitro mechanisms of particles emitted during the Amazon fires. We used as reference, the esti-
mated alveolar mass deposition accumulating over 24 h in human adults exposed to air concentrations identified 
in the Amazon region. PM10 concentrations used for mass calculation were 60 µg.m−
3 (peak identified during 
forest fire in Porto Velho - 2011) and 118 µg.m−
3 (peak identified during forest fire in Porto Velho - 2010)7. The 
average daily inhalation rate used in this study was 16 m3.day−
1 for adults65 and the alveolar deposition rate of 
PM10 in the human respiratory tract is approximately 20%66. It was, of course, not possible to directly extrapolate 
the real-world conditions, since we did not correct the dose with respect to alveolar surface. In addition, we used 
liquid extracts, which eliminated the effect of surface/reactivity properties of small particles. However, we con-
sider reasonable to say that our concentrations were within a plausible range.
RET, the most abundant PAH in Amazon samples, was also evaluated in this study. A mix of PAHs (ace-
naphthylene, phenanthrene, anthracene, fluorene, pyrene, benz[a]anthracene, chrysene, benzo[b]fluoranthene, 
benzo[k]fluoranthene, benzo[a]pyrene, indene[1,2,3-c,d]pyrene, dibenz[a,h]anthracene and benzo[g,h,i]pyrene; 
EPA 525 PAH Mix A (48953-U, Sigma)) was also used as positive control based on previous studies24, 67. Cell 
viability was performed 24 and 72 h after PM10 treatment using Cell Proliferation Kit II (XTT) (Roche, Basel, 
Switzerland) as described elsewhere68. The absorbance was measured at 492 nm (650 nm as reference). Cell via-
bility was expressed as percentage of control cells.
Alkaline comet assay. 
DNA strand breaks were detected using alkaline comet assay described in an earlier 
study34. A549 cells exposed to PM10 were trypsinized and resuspended in 180 µL 0.5% low melting point agarose 
at 37 °C. The cells were then spread homogenously on two microscope slides pre-coated with 1.5% agarose, imme-
diately covered with coverslips and kept at 4 °C for 10 min. Cells were then lysed overnight in chilled lysis solution 
at 4 °C. The slides were then placed horizontally in an electrophoresis chamber with cold alkaline buffer (300 mM 
NaOH, 1 mM EDTA, pH > 13) for 25 min at 25 V and 300 mA. The slides were then neutralized (0.4 M Tris, pH 
7.5) and fixed with ice-cold 100% ethanol. Finally, the slides were stained with ethidium bromide and imaged with 
a fluorescence microscope (Axiovert 200, Zeiss) at the magnification of 400x. At least 100 comets per slide were 
scored, on duplicate slides, using the Komet 6.0 software. The results were plotted by tail moment.
ROS formation. 
ROS formation were determined using DCFH-DA (2′
,7′
-dichlorofluorescein diacetate, 
Sigma-Aldrich,35845). After exposure to PM10, A549 cells were detached with trypsin and incubated with 
DCFHA-DA dye for 30 min at 37 °C in DMEM without phenol red and supplemented with 0.2% FBS. The green 
fluorescence intensity in each well was quantified using flow cytometry (Guava® easyCyte, USA). Results are 
shown in relative fluorescence units.
Mitochondrial superoxide formation. 
Mitochondrial superoxide production was measured by flow 
cytometry following staining with MitoSOX Red mitochondrial superoxide probe (Life Technologies, M36008). 
A549 cells treated with PM10 were detached by trypsin digestion. The cells were resuspended in DMEM without 
phenol red and supplemented with 0.2% FBS and incubated with 5 µM MitoSOX reagent for 20 min at 37 °C in 
the dark. The cells were washed twice with PBS and assessed using flow cytometry. Results are shown as relative 
fluorescence units.
Cytokines release analysis. 
In order to evaluate the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β
 and 
TNF-α
), we exposed A549 cells to organic PM10. The supernatant was snap frozen and stored at −
80 °C until anal-
ysis by Cytometric Bead Array assay, using the Human Inflammatory Cytokines Kit (BD Biosciences, USA). We 
used the BD Accuri C6 (BD Biosciences) flow cytometer along with the FCAP 3.0 software to analyze the fluores-
cence of each bead in the FL2 and FL3 channels, which correspond to the concentration of the different cytokines.
Analysis of autophagosome formation using GFP-LC3-expressing cells. 
Autophagosome forma-
tion, a hallmark of autophagy69, was monitored to establish the dynamics of autophagic process in PM10-exposed 
cells. For this purpose, we generated A549 cells stably expressing LC3 (a critical component of autophagosome 
formation) fused to GFP (GFP-LC3), and observed autophagosome formation under a fluorescence microscope, 
as described elsewhere69. Chloroquine treatment was used as a positive control for autophagosome visualization33.
Sub-G1 and cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry. 
Sub-G1 and cell cycle analysis were performed as 
previously described70. A549 cells treated with PM10 were trypsinized, washed with PBS, and fixed with chilled 
70% ethanol for at least 24 h, at −
20 °C. Staining was performed at room temperature for 30 min in filtered PBS 
containing 200 µL propidium iodide (PI) solution (200 mg. mL−
1 RNase A, 20 mg. mL−
1 PI, and 0.1% Triton 
X-100 in PBS) and each sample was analyzed in a flow cytometer. Guava Express Plus software was used to quan-
tify sub-G1, and cell cycle analysis was performed using ModFit LT software.

Double staining of γ
-H2AX and active caspase-3 by FACS. 
For concomitant analyses of γ
-H2AX 
and active caspase-3 by FACS, the protocol was adapted from Quinet et al.34. Briefly, adherent cells were com-
bined and fixed with 1% formaldehyde in ice, washed in PBS, and stored in 70% ethanol for at least overnight 
at −
20 °C. Cells were blocked and permeabilized with BSA-T buffer (0.2% Triton X-100, 1% BSA in PBS). For 
γ
-H2AX staining, samples were incubated with 1/500 anti-γ
-H2AX antibody (05–636 Millipore) for 3 h at 
room temperature followed by two washes with BSA-T buffer and incubation with 1/200 anti-mouse TRITC 
(tetramethylrhodamine) secondary antibody (T5393 Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 h at room temperature. After wash-
ing twice with BSA-T buffer, samples were incubated with 1/50 FITC- (fluorescein iso-thiocyanate) conjugated 
anti-active caspase-3 antibody (559341 BD Pharmigen) overnight at 4 °C. Fluorescence spectral overlap was com-
pensated using positive controls for both γ
-H2AX or active caspase-3 staining. Data was acquired on a Guava 
Flow Cytometer and analyzed using CytoSoft Data Acquisition and Analysis Software (Millipore).
Assessment of cell death. 
Cell death assessment was performed as described71. Briefly, A549 cells were 
collected by trypsinization and resuspended in 200 μ
L PBS. Ten microliters of this suspension was incubated 
for 5 min with 2 μ
L dye mixture containing 1 mg.mL−
1 PI (Sigma-Aldrich), 1.5 mg.mL−
1 diacetate fluorescein 
(Invitrogen, Life Technologies), and 1 mg.mL−
1 Hoechst 33342 (Invitrogen, Life Technologies) at 37 °C, and 
transferred to a microscope slide. For each treatment, the presence of live cells, early apoptosis, late apoptosis, 
and necrosis were evaluated in 500 cells (in triplicate) using a Zeiss microscope Bloom. Healthy cells and early 
apoptotic cells are refractory to PI staining, and show intact or fragmented nuclei, respectively, in blue (Hoechst 
staining). Late apoptotic cells and necrotic cells display fragmented or intact nuclei, respectively and stain red, 
since they are permeable to PI.
Protein extraction, quantification, and western blot analysis. 
Total protein extracts were ana-
lyzed as previously described70. Quantification was performed using the Pierce BCA Protein Assay kit (Thermo 
Scientific, USA). Fifty micrograms of total protein from cell extracts was separated on a 10% SDS polyacrylamide 
gel, and blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were blocked for 1 h in 5% (w/v) milk powder in 
PBS-Tween 20 (PBST), incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibody, washed three times with PBST, and 
incubated for 1 h with secondary antibody. After final washes with PBST, the blots were developed using an 
enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Immobilon Western, Merck Millipore). Protein expression was 
detected using anti-p53 (1:500, M7001, Dako Denmark A/S); anti-p21 (1:200, sc-56335, Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, 
CA, USA); anti-LC3 (1:1000 dilution, L8918, Sigma-Aldrich); anti-GAPDH (1:1000 dilution, Santa Cruz, Santa 
Cruz, CA, USA) antibodies.
Statistical analysis. 
Statistical analysis was performed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences 
(SPSS) version 15.0 and Prism 5, GraphPad Software Inc. Statistical significance was assessed using one-way 
ANOVA followed by the Dunnet’s test or Bonferroni test. The mean differences were considered significant at p 
≤
 0.05.
