Abstract
Background: Animal studies suggest that bisphenol A (BPA) may perturb pubertal development in females.
However, evidence from human studies is limited.
Methods: This was a cross-sectional study to investigate the association between BPA exposure and pubertal
development in school-aged girls. A total of 655 girls aged 9–18 years were selected from three schools in
Shanghai, from May to June 2011. We collected one single spot urine sample from each girl. Urine BPA
concentrations were measured by modified high-performance liquid chromatography and categorized according to
LOD and the median of those above LOD. Pubertal development status was assessed by using Tanner staging, and
age at menarche was collected as a milestone for mid-puberty. Modified Poisson regression was used to estimate
adjusted prevalence ratios (PRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
Results: After adjustment for potential confounders, girls with detected BPA were more likely to have delayed
menarche, a mid-puberty event, compared with girls with undetectable BPA; the prevalence ratios (PR) were 0.73 (0.
56, 0.95) for those with moderate BPA(LOD-median) and 0.72 (0.52, 0.99) for those with high BPA(>median),
respectively. Girls aged 9–12 years with detected BPA were more likely to have reached pubic hair stage 2, the
indicator of pubarche; while among girls aged >15 years, those with detected BPA were less likely to have reached
pubic hair stage 5, the late stage of pubic hair development.
Conclusions: BPA exposure was associated with alterations in the timing of pubertal development. Results in the
present study should be interpreted with caution because of its cross-sectional nature and the limited sample size
in each age group.

Background
Puberty is a life stage with rapid physiological changes,
including growth spurt and maturation of the gonads
and the brain. Variations in pubertal timing and progres-
sion have been related to several antecedents, including
genetic and environmental stressors [1]. Particularly, pu-
bertal development has been reported to be accompan-
ied with high vulnerability of the neuroendocrine system
to environmental factors, which may lead to long-term
effects on subsequent development [1]. One of the
environmental stressors to developing children is bisphe-
nol A (BPA) [2, 3]. BPA is a plasticizer, which is exten-
sively used in resin-based and polycarbonate plastic
products, including dental sealants and containers for
foods and beverages. BPA can leach from a variety of
consumer products and lead to wide spread human
exposure [4].
Animal studies have shown that BPA acts as an endo-
crine disruptor with both estrogenic and anti-androgenic
effects [2, 5]. The endocrine disrupting properties of
BPA have also been demonstrated in human studies.
These studies suggest that BPA is associated with in-
creased risk of obesity [6], polycystic ovarian syndrome
[7], recurrent miscarriage [8] and male infertility [2]. As

 pubertal growth is a hormone-dependent process [9], it
is, therefore, plausible that chemicals with endocrine dis-
rupting effects, like BPA, may induce altered pubertal
maturation tempo. BPA is suggested to disrupt the key
hormones responsible for sexual maturation [10]. Stud-
ies in mice have indicated that BPA exposure is associ-
ated with accelerated vaginal opening [3, 11, 12], but
delayed vaginal opening [13] and testicular descent [14]
have also been reported.
Pubertal
development
in
humans
involves
both
adrenarche and gonadarche, two independent pro-
cesses. Adrenarche is induced by adrenal androgens,
which are responsible for the initiation of pubic hair
growth, as well as other pubertal events including
acne, oily skin, deepened voice and adult-type body
odor. Gonadarche refers to the reactivation of the
hypothalamic-pituitary, and is characterized by the ap-
pearance of breast tissue. Longitudinal studies have
shown that the pubertal development for girls may start
with breast tissue appearance (thelarche) or pubic hair
growth (pubarche), or concordant maturation of breasts
and appearance of pubic hair [15, 16].
A few studies have explored the effect of BPA expos-
ure on pubertal development in girls, but most of them
used menarche age as the only endpoint for pubertal de-
velopment assessment [17–19]. However, as mentioned
above, breast development and the presence of pubic
hair are known to be the early markers of pubertal mat-
uration, while the onset of menarche occurs approxi-
mately 2 years after breast development. In addition,
earlier pubertal onset may not necessarily be followed by
an earlier age of menarche [20] due to the compensatory
delay, which indicates both earlier and later events of
pubertal development should be included to examine
the effect of exogenous endocrine disrupting chemicals
like BPA.
In the present study, we examined the profile of pu-
bertal development in relation to BPA exposure among
school-aged girls using menarche and Tanner stages,
through which puberty onset and progression were
evaluated.
Methods
The present study was an ancillary study to a large na-
tional study of pubertal development and health of ado-
lescents in schools in Jiading District, Shanghai, China,
which had already collected anthropometric measures
and information related to pubertal development. The
current study added collection of urine samples. There-
fore, participants were not aware of the specific hypoth-
esis of the study. A detailed description of our study has
been published elsewhere [6]. The following are brief de-
scriptions of the study elements relevant to the present
study.
Study population
In 2011, the largest elementary, middle, and high schools
in the study area (Jiading District, Shanghai) were se-
lected, respectively. All girls from grades 4 through
12(aged from 9 to 18 years) were considered eligible for
the study. We randomly selected four classes from each
grade(i.e. elementary, middle, and high school) and
about 80 girls from each grade were recruited (there
were approximately 20 girls in each class). Overall, 743
girls were eligible for our study. Among them, ten girls
(1.3%) refused to participate, 72 girls did not provide
urine specimens, and urine samples of six girls were ac-
cidentally damaged during transportation. Finally, 655
girls (88.2%) were included in the analyses.
In-person data collection
All girls completed a self-administered questionnaire, in
which
the
following
informations
were
collected:1)
demographic characteristics, including age, school and
residence. In addition, a 1–5 rating scale (poor to good)
was used for self-evaluation of household income. Those
who reported 1–3 were categorized as middle and
below, and 4–5 were categorized as upper middle and
highest. 2) Self-evaluated sleeping quality (poor, normal,
good) and dietary patterns. A food frequency question-
naire was utilized to ascertain the frequency of food in-
take per week, including soy bean food (soy bean or soy
bean products, such as soy bean milk, tofu, etc.), vegeta-
bles, fruits, junk food(food that have little nutritional
value but plenty of calories, salt, and fats, like fried fast
food and sugary carbonated beverages. The girls were
asked to self-evaluate whether they have an unbalanced
diet (yes/no). 3) Time spent on sports activity were col-
lected and classified as ≥30 min/day and <30 min/day. 4)
Girls’ current depression status was evaluated by using
the published Children’s Depression Inventory (CDI).
BPA measurements
We collected one single spot urine sample from each
participating girl. We measured urinary concentrations
of total BPA (free plus conjugated species) through
modified
high-performance
liquid
chromatography
(HPLC) as described by He et al. [21]. The recom-
mended value for the Limit of Detection (LOD) is three
times the standard deviation of replicate measurements
of a blank or low-level sample [22]. The LOD of BPA in
the present study was 0.31 μg/L, which is comparable to
the published LOD [4, 23]. Adjustment for creatinine
was performed as urine BPA level divided by creatinine
level to account for urine volume.
Pubertal development assessment
Pubertal development was measured by Tanner staging,
according to internationally accepted criteria, through
Miao et al. Environmental Health  (2017) 16:80 
Page 2 of 7
 visual inspection by the same trained physician [24].
Tanner staging provides separate scales for pubic hair
and breast development. Pubic hair and breast develop-
ment was determined as 1(pre-puberty), 2(onset), 3(on-
going), 4(nearly complete) or 5 (complete and adult-like)
[25]. Height and weight were measured while barefoot
and clad only in light underwear, according to the
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES) [26].
Statistical analysis
All analyses were conducted using STATA 12.0 (Stata
Corp., LP, College Station, TX). Demographic character-
istics of girls were tabulated according to their urine
BPA level, which was categorized into three groups by
LOD(0.31
μg/L)
and
the
median
of
those
above
LOD(3.75 μg/gCr). This categorization can provide lar-
ger sample size when examining the effect of BPA at
higher and lower exposure level compared with other
categorization alternatives. We did not examine pubertal
stages as ordinal categorical variables since the pubertal
development did not follow a linear velocity, largely due
to the growth spurt. Instead, we tabulated the percent-
age of girls who reached pubertal milestones across BPA
exposure level at the relevant age. We examined associa-
tions between BPA exposure and different milestones
(present or absent) representing the onset of pubertal
development, as indicated by breast development stage 2
and above(B2+) and pubic hair stage 2 and above(PH2
+), mid-puberty, as indicated by menarche, and late pu-
berty, as indicated by breast development stage 5 (B5)
and pubic hair stage 2 (PH5). Inclusion of Tanner Stage
5 in the analysis would provide information on BPA’s ef-
fect on pubertal progression. Modified Poisson regres-
sion with robust error variance was used to estimate
adjusted prevalence ratios (PRs) and 95% confidence in-
tervals (CIs), since the outcomes (pubertal stages) were
not rare and thus odds ratios were not likely compatible
with risk estimate.
We did not provide PR for each age due to the small
sample size; instead, girls were grouped by age according
to their relevance to the outcome examined. For ex-
ample, when we examined BPA’s effect on pubertal on-
set, we only included girls younger than 12 years, since
almost all girls beyond 12 years reached Tanner stage 2
and thus no valid comparison can be performed. While
in the analysis of menarche, we restricted our analyses in
girls who were aged less than 14 years of age, since all
participants older than 14 reported to have experienced
menarche, and the longer since menarche, the less indi-
cative of the current exposure to BPA for the exposure
at menarche.
The following characteristic were adjusted in the Pois-
son

as

according

[19,
27–29]:
age,
BMI(≥25, 18.5–24.9, or <18.5), household income (mid-
dle and below, or upper middle and highest), sleep qual-
ity (good, normal, or poor), unbalanced diet (yes or no),
sports activity (≥30 min/day, or < 30 min/day), and de-
pression scores (categorized by median: ≥10, or <10).
Results
The mean age of 655 participants was 12.9 ± 2.7 years,
which was younger than the 88 girls who were not in-
cluded in the analysis (15.8 ± 2.4 years).
The median urinary BPA concentration was 1.24
(interquartile range: LOD-4.80) μg/gCr in girls. About
60% of the urinary samples had concentrations of BPA
above LOD (0.31 μg/L). The median BPA concentration
level among those with detected BPA was 3.75 μg/gCr,
which was used as the cut-point of higher and lower
BPA exposure.
Table 1 shows the characteristics of participating girls
according to urine BPA level. Urine BPA levels were
comparable with regard to school categories, residence,
household income, BMI, sleep quality, sports activity,
dietary pattern (unbalanced diet; junk food intake, vege-
table intake, fruit intake, soybean food intake), and de-
pression status. Girls aged 11–12 and 15–16 had higher
urinary BPA, but no clear pattern was observed with re-
gard to the distribution of BPA across age.
All girls reported to have experienced menarche at
age 14 (Table 2). The following analyses on BPA and
menarche
were
thus
conducted
among
girls
aged
<14(n = 383), since the comparison of menarche occur-
rence across BPA exposure is not feasible among girls
aged ≥14. All girls reached thelarche(breast develop-
ment stage 2 and above, B2+) at age 12. With regard to
pubic hair development, the percentage of girls who
had reached pubarche (pubic hair stage 2 and above,
PH2+) was 92.5% for girls at age 12. At age 14, all girls
reached PH2+. We therefore chose girls aged <12 for
the analysis of BPA and puberty onset, since most of
the girls aged ≥12 had reached puberty onset (100% for
thelarche and 92.5% for pubarche). For the same rea-
son, analyses on puberty progression(breast develop-
ment stage 2, B5; pubic hair stage 5, PH5) were
conducted among girls aged ≥13.
A total of 383 girls who were less than 14 years old
were analyzed with regard to the association between
BPA exposure and menarche. Compared with girls with
undetected BPA, girls with moderate (LOD-median) and
high (>median) BPA were less likely to have experienced
menarche, PRs(95%CI) were 0.73 (0.56, 0.95) and 0.72
(0.52, 0.99), respectively, indicating that BPA exposure
was associated with delayed age at menarche(Table 3).
Analyses by age also show that girls with moderate and
Miao et al. Environmental Health  (2017) 16:80 
Page 3 of 7
 high BPA had lower numbers who had reached menar-
che at ages 11, 12 and 13 years (data not shown).
Among girls aged less than 12 years, those with mod-
erate BPA were more likely to have reached PH2+ after
adjustment for potential confounders (PR: 1.48; 95%CI:
0.76, 2.88). Analyses by age also showed that those with
moderate BPA consistently had higher percentages of
those who experienced PH2+ at the age of 9, 10 and
11 years(data not shown). However, among girls aged
more than 13 years, those with moderate and high BPA
were less likely to have reached PH5, PRs(95%CI) were
0.73(0.44, 1.21) and 0.76 (0.46, 1.25), respectively (Table
4). Analyses by age also showed a similar pattern at the
age of 13, 14, 15, and 16 years (data not shown). A simi-
lar, but less typical association, was observed for breast
development (Table 5).
Discussion
In this cross-sectional study of school-aged girls, we
found that BPA exposure was associated with delayed

 menarche, an indicator of mid-puberty. We also found a
non-significant tendency that BPA exposure was associ-
ated with earlier pubic hair onset, and delayed progres-
sion of pubic hair development.
The association between BPA exposure and delayed
menarche found in the present study was consistent
with a previous study based on NHANES data, which
reported moderate BPA exposure was associated with
delayed menarche, although the association was non-
significant [19]. Timing of menarche is influenced by
many factors, including genetic background, ethnicity,
obesity, nutrition and physical activity. In the last few
decades, more and more studies have recognized EDCs,
including dioxins, phthalates, organohalogens and PCBs,
as important contributors influencing the timing of me-
narche, although the findings have not always been con-
sistent. In the present study, we did not observe a
stronger association among girls with high BPA expos-
ure compared with those with moderate exposure, which
is consistent with the report of the nonmonotonic dose–
response effect of EDCs, including BPA [30]. The onset
of menarche occurs approximately 2 years after breast
development. In studies carried out in Spain, the United
States, and Greece, early maturing girls were found to
present a compensatory delay in pubertal progression
[31–33]. These observations were consistent with our
finding that those with high BPA exposure were more
likely to reach pubic hair onset earlier while having a
later menarche age and pubic hair stage 5.
The association of BPA exposure with early pubic hair
onset, although not statistically significant, is consistent
with the effect observed on other estrogen-like endo-
crine disruptors such as phthalates [1]. It was reported
that pubertal hair development may rely on adrenal an-
drogens, chiefly dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) [34],
while breast development is more likely to be attributed
to the effect of estrogen [35]. Higher BPA has been
found to be associated with increased DHEA levels in
both pre-adolescent girls and adult females [36, 37],
which provides a potential underlying mechanism for
the present finding. The result is also in line with the
finding that BPA exposure is associated with polycystic
ovarian syndrome [7], an abnormality characterized by
the presence of hyper androgenism [38].
Although both breast development and presence of
pubic hair are known to be early markers of pubertal
maturation, breast development is more likely to be con-
founded by excess adiposity [39], which may also con-
tribute to the non-significant association between BPA
exposure and breast development.
It has been reported that prenatal growth is sensitive
to extrogenous EDCs exposure. Our study suggests that
pubertal development may also be sensitive to adverse
effects of BPA [2]. Perinatal BPA exposure is associated
with fetal growth as well as the growth pattern after
birth, including pubertal growth. The present study is
limited by the fact that perinatal exposure was not col-
lected and thus its contribution to pubertal develop-
ment,
as
well
as
its
interaction
with
peripubertal
exposure, cannot be evaluated. Longitudinal studies
examining both perinatal and peripubertal BPA exposure
are needed to clarify the effect.
The study has several strengths. First, we utilized both
menarche and Tanner Staging, a well-validated tool for

information than most studies with menarche as the
only endpoint. Second, we were able to control for many
potential confounders including depression status, sports
activity strength, and dietary pattern.
Our study also has limitations.
First, the
cross-
sectional design limited our ability to examine a causal
relationship due to difficulties with temporality. Second,
the sample size in each age group was small and the
power to detect a difference, if it existed, was limited.
Around 12% of girls were not included in the analysis
due to refusal or loss of urine samples. As the study was
an ancillary study to a national survey, eligible girls were
unaware of the specific hypothesis of the study, thus se-
lection bias is less likely to be a problem. Third, we col-
lected only one single spot urine to reflect the BPA
exposure. BPA is metabolized relatively rapidly, [40].
One single urine BPA measurement may not reflect
average BPA exposures. Although girls may be exposed
to BPA via oral ingestion, inhalation and dermal absorp-
tion, the predominant source of exposure was likely
through diet. Since dietary patterns were relatively
steady, the BPA level obtained in the present study was
likely representative of the average BPA exposure level.
Fourth, recall error or bias may exist for reporting retro-
spective events such as age at menarche. Since the par-
ticipants were not aware of the specific hypothesis of the
study, this recall error was likely to be non-differential
misclassification, thereby potentially diluting the associa-
tions [41]. Lastly, the study was also limited by the low
proportion of girls with detectable BPA(around 60%), al-
though the rate was similar to two other Chinese studies
with similar LOD (0.31μg/L) [21, 42].
Conclusions
We observed that BPA exposure was associated with
earlier pubertal onset and delayed pubertal progression,
although prospective studies are needed to warrant the
association.
