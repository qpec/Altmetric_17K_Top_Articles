abstract
Today’s children and adolescents are immersed in both traditional and new 
forms of digital media. Research on traditional media, such as television, 
has identifi
 ed health concerns and negative outcomes that correlate with 
the duration and content of viewing. Over the past decade, the use of digital 
media, including interactive and social media, has grown, and research 
evidence suggests that these newer media offer both benefi
 ts and risks 
to the health of children and teenagers. Evidence-based benefi
 ts identifi
 ed 
from the use of digital and social media include early learning, exposure 
to new ideas and knowledge, increased opportunities for social contact 
and support, and new opportunities to access health promotion messages 
and information. Risks of such media include negative health effects on 
sleep, attention, and learning; a higher incidence of obesity and depression; 
exposure to inaccurate, inappropriate, or unsafe content and contacts; and 
compromised privacy and confi
 dentiality. This technical report reviews the 
literature regarding these opportunities and risks, framed around clinical 
questions, for children from birth to adulthood. To promote health and 
wellness in children and adolescents, it is important to maintain adequate 
physical activity, healthy nutrition, good sleep hygiene, and a nurturing 
social environment. A healthy Family Media Use Plan (www. 
healthychildren. 
org/ 
MediaUsePlan) that is individualized for a specifi
 c child, teenager, or 
family can identify an appropriate balance between screen time/online time 
and other activities, set boundaries for accessing content, guide displays 
of personal information, encourage age-appropriate critical thinking and 
digital literacy, and support open family communication and implementation 
of consistent rules about media use.

(TV), radio, and periodicals, have 
been supplemented by new digital 
technologies that promote interactive 
and social engagement and allow 
children and teenagers instant access 
to entertainment, information, and 
knowledge; social contact; and 
marketing. Traditional media, also 
referred to as broadcast media, 
typically were created externally by an 
established production source, such as 
a film studio, TV network, or editorial 
staff and were provided either to 
individuals or to a broader audience 
for passive viewing or reading. In 
contrast, newer digital media, which 
include social and interactive media, 
are a form of media in which users 
can both consume and actively 
create content. Examples include 
applications (apps), multiplayer video 
games, YouTube videos, or video 
blogs (vlogs). For children and young 
adults today, this evolving integration 
of passively viewed and interactive 
media is seamless and natural; the 
distinctions and boundaries between 
traditional/broadcast and interactive/
social media have become blurred or 
imperceptible.
Digital media allow information 
sharing across a variety of media 
formats, including text, photographs, 
video, and audio. Today’s video 
games, for example, often represent a 
merging of both traditional and social 
media, as users can virtually “inhabit” 
impressively produced worlds and 
interact with other users in remote 
locations. Video game participants 
can even work collaboratively to 
cocreate virtual worlds. Thus, digital 
media can provide an engaging 
experience in which the media 
experiences of children and teenagers 
become highly personalized.
MEDIA USE ESTIMATES
How Are Media Usage Patterns 
Changing in Young Children?
The evolution of media from 
traditional to newer forms of digital 
media in the past decade has resulted 
in changes in the patterns of media 
use. For example, in 1970, children 
began to regularly watch TV at 4 
years of age, whereas today, children 
begin interacting with digital media 
at 4 months of age.
As new media platforms and social 
media have been incorporated into 
children’s media diets, hours spent 
in TV viewing have slowly decreased 
over the past 2 decades. Loprinzi 
and Davis 
1 examined trends in 
parent-reported TV viewing among 
preschoolers 2 to 5 years of age 
(n = 5724) and children 6 to 11 years 
of age (n = 7104) between 2001 and 
2012 using data from the National 
Health and Nutrition Examination 
Survey (NHANES), showing 
significant decreases in mean TV 
viewing over time, primarily for 
preschoolers and, to a lesser extent, 
for school-aged children. Non-
Hispanic white boys demonstrated 
the largest decrease in mean viewing 
of 29%, from 2.24 hours of TV per 
day down to 1.59 hours of TV per 
day. Despite these decreases, the 
majority of parents still reported that 
their children watched TV for 2 or 
more hours per day.
It is unclear whether these decreases 
are in part the result of parents 
heeding expert recommendations 
to limit screen time (evidence 
would suggest not) 
2 or whether 
they represent a displacement of 
TV viewing by the use of novel 
platforms. In young children, 
use of mobile devices, such as 
smartphones and tablet computers, 
has risen dramatically since the 
Kaiser Family Foundation first 
began surveying parents of 0- to 
8-year-olds about their technology 
use. 
3 For example, in 2011, 52% 
of children 0 to 8 years of age had 
access to a mobile device (although 
only 38% had ever used one). By 
2013, this access had increased to 
75% of 0- to 8-year-olds. 
4 Although 
these national surveys continued to 
demonstrate a digital divide on the 
basis of economic status, with less 
access to mobile technology and the 
Internet in lower-income families, 
a smaller study in 2015 called this 
disparity into question by showing 
that almost all (96.6%) 0- to 4-year-
olds recruited from a low-income 
pediatric clinic had used mobile 
devices, and 75% owned their own 
device. 
5 This study also showed 
that most 2-year-olds used mobile 
devices on a daily basis and that most 
of the 1-year-olds assessed (92.2%) 
had already used a mobile device. 
Although a digital divide likely still 
exists in terms of access to quality 
content and reliable Wi-Fi, it is now 
clear that most young children seen 
by a pediatric health care provider 
will have used or have been exposed 
to mobile technology.
Exactly what young children are 
doing on mobile technology has not 
been studied in great detail, because 
mobile device usage is relatively 
recent and methodologically 
difficult to assess. By parent report, 
most children in the Kabali et al 
study 
5 watched YouTube or Netflix 
primarily, and smaller proportions 
watched educational programs 
and played early-learning apps 
(eg, alphabet and counting apps). 
A large minority also played games 
or watched cartoons. Common 
Sense Media’s Zero to Eight survey 
has found disparities in the use of 
educational media on mobile devices, 
with 54% of children from higher-
income families often or sometimes 
using educational content on mobile 
devices but only 28% of children 
from lower-income families doing 
so. 
4 Thus, younger children and 
those from lower-income families are 
more likely to use mobile devices for 
entertainment purposes.
How Are Media Being Used in Older 
Children and Teens Today? Which 
Modes of Use Are Most Popular?
Studies show that social media use 
patterns and rates among older

children and adolescents have 
continued to grow over the past 
decade, aided in part by the recent 
rise in mobile phone use among 
children and teenagers. At present, 
approximately three-quarters of 
teenagers own a smartphone, 24% 
of adolescents describe themselves 
as “constantly connected” to the 
Internet 
6 and 50% report feeling 
“addicted” to their phones. 
7 Mobile 
apps provide a breadth of specific 
functions, such as gaming, photo 
and video sharing, and global 
positioning system monitoring. 
Social media sites and their 
associated mobile apps provide 
a platform for users to create an 
online identity, communicate with 
others, and build a social network. 
Among the myriad accessible social 
networking sites, Facebook remains 
the most popular, with 71% of 13- 
to 17-year-olds surveyed by the 
Pew Research Center in 2014 and 
2015 reporting using this site/app. 
6 
However, adolescents today do not 
typically dedicate themselves to 
just 1 site; most teenagers maintain 
a “social media portfolio” of 
several selected sites including, as 
indicated by rates of use in the Pew 
survey, Instagram (52%), Snapchat 
(41%), Twitter (33%), Google+ 
(33%), Vine (24%), Tumblr (14%), 
and other social media (11%). 
6
As communication moves from 
face-to-face and voice-only phone 
conversations to more screen-
to-screen interactions via apps, 
such as FaceTime or Skype, daily 
communication is becoming 
intertwined with screen time. 
Texting, using a smartphone 
keyboard to send a written message 
or a visual symbol (emoji) to another 
smartphone, also has become a 
prominent means of communication 
for teenagers.
Lines are also becoming 
blurred between media use 
for communication versus for 
entertainment. With the ability 
to message your opponent while 
engaging in a remote video game 
or tweet while watching a TV 
show, viewers and gamers often 
link their entertainment to social 
media. Modes of communication 
have become more fluid, with 
conversations jumping back and 
forth between text messages to 
social media sites. Text messages 
also may include links to media, such 
as personal videos, YouTube videos, 
and links to Web sites and social 
networking sites.
Pew data from 2012 suggest that 
teenagers between 14 and 17 
years of age sent a median of 100 
texts a day. With all likelihood, this 
number will continue to increase 
as new data become available. 
Texting no longer is limited to 
cellular phone systems but can be 
facilitated by messaging apps, such 
as Kik or WhatsApp. Pew data from 
2015 show that these apps are most 
popular with Latino (46%) and 
African-American (47%) teenagers, 
compared with white teenagers 
(24%). 
6
Video games also remain very 
popular among families; it is 
estimated that 4 out of 5 households 
own a device used to play video 
games, and approximately half 
of US homes own a dedicated 
game console. 
8 Video games also 
are available via apps on mobile 
devices. Additionally, apps that 
have a practical function are also 
being marketed with a gaming 
perspective; this approach is known 
as “gamification.”
It is common for adolescents today 
to engage in more than 1 form of 
media at the same time, a practice 
referred to as media multitasking. 
This multitasking may include 
watching TV and using a computer 
9 
or being online and engaging in more 
than 1 activity. In one study of older 
adolescents, approximately 50% 
of the time students were online, 
they were engaged in more than 1 
activity. 
10
GAMIFICATION AND ADVERTISING
What Is Gamifi
 cation? What Is the 
Impact of Gamifi
 cation on Media Use 
by Children?
Gamification applies gaming 
elements to a real-world activity 
in a seamless, user-friendly, and 
attractive way. Commercial video 
games have incorporated cutting-
edge graphics, behavioral reinforcers 
(ie, for reaching certain levels of 
play), and exciting stories, which 
have been delivered through 
stationary personal computers, 
dedicated gaming consoles, or 
multiplayer networks. One key 
difference today is the portability 
achieved via smartphones, mobile 
Wi-Fi, and broad social networks, 
which has changed how and 
where games can be played and 
how gaming functions can be 
applied. These portable “games” 
can now be integrated into daily 
life by functioning as sources for 
information and guidance and by 
providing motivation to achieve 
academic and wellness goals. For 
example, the Nike+ app tracks 
exercisers’ routes, pace, steps, 
distance, and time and challenges 
runners to compete with friends 
and improve their performance. 
Such design also serves to reinforce 
behavior (both health behaviors and 
for using the app), resulting in more 
engagement with both. 
11
How Have Mobile and Social Media 
Changed the Ability of Advertisers to 
Reach Children and Teenagers?
Newer media have provided 
expanding opportunities for 
marketers and advertisers to adapt 
their messages to reach millions 
of children and teenagers. 
12 These 
newer forms of media may broaden 
the types of products and behaviors 
to which children and adolescents 
are exposed. For example, although 
restrictions may exist to limit 
exposure to advertisements for 
alcohol in traditional media, research 
e3
 by guest on June 1, 2019
www.aappublications.org/news
Downloaded from 
 FROM THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS
suggests that the major alcohol 
brands maintain a strong presence on 
Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube. 
13, 
 
14 
From a marketing perspective, 
social media are consumer focused, 
allowing interaction and input 
that can build relationships. 
15 
Social media also allow targeted 
ads that reflect content that users 
have posted on their own pages. In 
one study, researchers found that 
placing content related to exercise 
or nutrition as a status update on 
Facebook led to advertisements 
for sports gear and diets as well as 
junk food.15 Thus, social media ads 
can directly address individuals or 
groups who would be interested and 
responsive. Social media ads may 
also be interactive and are more 
affordable to create and disseminate. 
However, this ability for marketers to 
reach children through social media 
is understudied.
Marketing to parents of young 
children also is common, because 
advertisers know that many 
parents fear that their children 
may fall behind in the skilled use of 
technology without early exposure 
to it. 
16 In reality, parents can be 
reassured that their children will 
learn to use digital media quickly 
when they are introduced at home or 
in school.
BENEFITS AND OPPORTUNITIES OF 
MEDIA USE
Fortunately, new media use is 
not without its benefits, but these 
benefits largely depend on a child’s 
age and developmental stage, a child’s 
characteristics, how the media are 
used (eg, with a parent or without), 
and the media content and design.
Early Childhood
At What Age Can Infants and Toddlers 
Learn From Screens?
Evidence continues to show limited 
educational benefits of media for 
children younger than 2 years. 
Earlier American Academy of 
Pediatrics (AAP) recommendations 
to discourage media exposure 
for children younger than 2 years 
were based on research on TV and 
videos, which showed that in-person 
interactions with parents are much 
more effective than video for learning 
of new verbal or nonverbal problem-
solving skills. 
17 This research showed 
that infants and toddlers experience 
what was referred to as the “video 
deficit:” difficulty learning from 
2-dimensional video representations 
at younger than 30 months of age. 
The video deficit is thought to be 
attributable to infants’ and young 
toddlers’ lack of symbolic thinking, 
immature attentional controls, and 
the memory flexibility required 
to effectively transfer knowledge 
from a 2-dimensional platform to a 
3-dimensional world. 
18 Before 2 years 
of age, children are still developing 
cognitive, language, sensorimotor, and 
social-emotional skills, which require 
hands-on exploration and social 
interaction with trusted caregivers for 
successful maturation.
Therefore, adult interaction 
remains crucial for toddlers to learn 
effectively from digital media. For 
example, from 12 to 24 months of 
age, toddlers can begin to learn novel 
words from commercially available 
“word learning” videos, but only if 
their parents watch with them and 
reteach the words, essentially using 
the videos as a learning scaffold to 
build the language skills. 
19, 
 
20 In one 
longitudinal study of low-income 
families, 14-month-olds whose 
mothers had talked with them during 
educational TV programming since 
infancy showed more advanced 
language development than infants 
whose mothers did not talk with 
them during media use (although 
this finding also may have reflected 
how much mothers spoke to children 
in general). 
21 The few experimental 
studies showing independent 
learning of words from videos at this 
age have been limited by their low 
ecologic validity 
22 or have shown that 
toddlers lose the knowledge learned 
over time without repetition.23
More recent research has shown that, 
under particular conditions, children 
between 15 and 24 months of age 
can learn from repeated viewing 
of video demonstrations without 
adult help. Dayanim and Namy 
showed that 15-month-olds could 
learn the meaning of sign language 
symbols after 3 weeks of watching 
a commercially available video 4 
times per week. 
24 However, children 
in a comparison study group whose 
parents used a book of sign language 
symbols to teach the content retained 
more knowledge about the symbols’ 
meanings for a longer period of time.
Building parasocial relationships 
with TV or video characters (ie, the 
perceived relationship that audience 
members develop with characters 
who speak to them, such as Elmo or 
Dora) also has been shown to improve 
toddlers’ learning. Calvert et al 
25 
showed that, after 3 months of playing 
with a personalized interactive toy, 
21-month-olds could learn how to 
stack cups from a video demonstration 
by the same character, suggesting 
that building an emotional bond with 
an on-screen character improves 
learning potential. However, a primary 
limitation of such experimental studies 
is that they do not examine how 
repeated media use displaces other 
activities, and they do not examine 
longer-term outcomes. For example, in 
the study by Calvert and colleagues, 
 
25 
children randomly assigned to 
the group that did not receive the 
interactive toy for 3 months actually 
scored better in terms of language 
development at 21 months of age.
Are Touchscreens More Educational?
Pedagogic theory has long 
emphasized that interaction improves 
learning. This understanding 
has been the motivation for 
recommending coviewing of 
media, along with evidence that 
e4
 by guest on June 1, 2019

Downloaded from 
 PEDIATRICS Volume  
138 
, number  
5 
,  
November 2016 
parent interaction increases young 
children’s engagement with media 
and understanding of content. 
26 
The interactivity of new media via 
touchscreens allows apps to “know” 
whether a child is responding 
accurately and tailor responses, 
reinforcement, and next steps to the 
child’s input. Theoretically, this may 
increase educational potential by 
providing scaffolding to build skills at 
the child’s edge of competence.
Empirical evidence regarding 
interactive media use in infants and 
toddlers is sparse. At 24 months of 
age, a child can learn words from 
live video-chatting with a responsive 
adult 
27 or from carefully designed, 
interactive screen interfaces that 
prompt the child to tap on relevant 
learning items. 
28 Starting at 15 
months of age, toddlers can learn 
novel words from touchscreens 
in laboratory-based studies (with 
specially designed, not commercial, 
apps) but have trouble transferring 
this knowledge to the 3-dimensional 
world, 
 
29 particularly if they regularly 
use touchscreen platforms to view 
entertainment media.
Is Skyping Appropriate for Infants and 
Toddlers?
Many parents now use video-chat (eg, 
Skype, Facetime) as an interactive 
media form that facilitates social 
connection with distant relatives. 
New evidence shows that infants and 
toddlers regularly engage in video-
chatting, 
 
30 but the same principles 
regarding need for parental support 
would apply in order for infants and 
toddlers to understand what they are 
seeing. Because video-chat episodes 
usually are brief, 
 
30 promote social 
connection, and involve support from 
adults, this practice should not be 
discouraged in infants and toddlers.
What Is the Best Approach to Selecting 
Quality Content for Young Children?
High-quality TV programs (eg, 
Public Broadcasting Service [PBS] 
programs, such as Sesame Street and 
Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood) can 
demonstrably improve cognitive, 
linguistic, and social outcomes 
for children 3 to 5 years of age. 
Although there have been few large 
community-based, randomized 
trials, many observational studies 
and some small experimental ones 
have demonstrated that preschoolers 
can learn literacy, numeracy, and 
prosocial skills from high-quality TV 
programs. 
31, 
 
32 In addition, Sesame 
Workshop and other child content 
creators have been responding 
to current child health and 
developmental needs (eg, obesity, 
resilience) by crafting programming 
aimed at teaching parents and 
children relevant knowledge and 
skills.
Choosing PBS content has been found 
to be protective of poor executive 
function outcomes observed in 
children who start consuming media 
in early infancy. 
33 Preschoolers 
randomly assigned to change from 
inappropriate or violent content to 
high-quality prosocial programming 
were found to have significant 
improvements in their externalizing 
and internalizing behavior, 
 
32 which 
also speaks to the importance of 
content. For families who find it 
difficult to modify the overall amount 
of media use in their homes, changing 
to high-quality content may be a 
more actionable alternative; to make 
these changes, pediatric providers 
can direct them toward curation 
services, such as Common Sense 
Media, for reviews of videos, apps, TV 
shows, and movies.
Are “Educational” Apps and e-Books 
Really Educational?
As content from PBS high-quality 
programs is translated into apps and 
game formats (eg, Martha Speaks, Big 
Bird’s Words, and Cookie Monster’s 
Challenge apps), educational benefits 
have been shown in preschoolers. 
34 
Unfortunately, very few of the 
commercially available apps found 
in the educational section of app 
stores have evidence-based design 
input with demonstrated learning 
effectiveness. In fact, recent reviews 
of hundreds of toddler/preschooler 
apps labeled as educational have 
demonstrated that most apps show 
low educational potential, target 
only rote academic skills (eg, ABCs, 
colors), are not based on established 
curricula, and include almost no 
input from developmental specialists 
or educators. 
35, 
 
36 An additional 
concern is that the formal features 
(ie, bells and whistles) that are 
designed to engage the child in an 
interactive experience may actually 
decrease the child’s comprehension 
or distract from social interaction 
between caregivers and children 
during use, as has been shown 
for e-books, 
 
37 which is important, 
because active parent involvement 
in both digital play and book reading 
improves children’s learning from 
the experience.38, 
 
39
One reason that children may be 
less socially engaged during digital 
play is that gaming design involves 
behavioral reinforcement meant 
to achieve a maximum duration of 
engagement, which may explain 
why interrupting children’s digital 
play leads to tantrums, particularly 
when games or videos are set on 
autoadvance. 
40 To address these 
concerns, academic and industry 
leaders have recently recommended 
creating digital products for children 
that are appropriately engaging, but 
not distracting; that are designed 
to be used by a dual audience (ie, 
both parent and child) to facilitate 
family participation in media use and 
modeling of more effective social and 
learning interactions 
35, 
 
41; and that 
have automatic “stops” as the default 
design to encourage children and 
caregivers to pause the game use and 
turn to the 3-dimensional world. 
40
One recent app, for example, 
demonstrates such an adult–child 
dyad-centered design. Bedtime Math 
creates a platform and a structure for 
e5

 FROM THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS
parents and children to read stories 
and answer math problems together 
on a nightly basis. It is one of the 
few apps that has been tested in a 
randomized controlled community-
based trial and shown benefits. 
42 
Embedding, indeed requiring, social 
interactivity for functionality may 
hold great promise for even younger 
children as well. However, recent 
population-based surveys suggest 
that joint media engagement 
43 (and 
designs to facilitate it) 
35 is not as 
common as individual use.
School-Aged Children and Teenagers
How Can Media Use in Older Children 
and Teenagers Increase Collaboration 
and Tolerance?
Research studies as well as anecdotal 
reports have suggested benefits of 
media use for today’s children and 
adolescents, such as communication 
and engagement. 
44 Additional benefits 
include exposure to new ideas and 
immersive learning experiences. 
Many social media platforms provide 
tools that students can use to touch 
base with and collaborate with 
others on projects. Communicating 
across distance is made easier by 
social media; these communications 
may include connecting via video-
chatting with family or friends 
who are separated geographically. 
Traditional and social media can also 
raise awareness of current events 
and issues, and social media can 
provide tools to promote community 
participation and civic engagement.
A study by Kidd and Castano 
45 
indicated that reading literary fiction 
improves empathy in children. 
Although books are a traditional 
form of media, the study indicates 
that exposure to character-focused 
media can break stereotypes and 
help children understand people 
from whom they differ. Internet 
usage/digital media consumption 
is positioned to have a similar 
impact, which is important to help 
children learn about, understand, and 
empathize with marginalized groups.
How Can Social Media Be Used To 
Promote Improved Health?
Health benefits of social media may 
include enhanced access to valuable 
support networks. These networks 
may be particularly helpful for 
patients with ongoing illnesses, 
conditions, or disabilities 
46 as well as 
for those identifying as lesbian, gay, 
bisexual, transgender, questioning, 
or intersex (LGBTQI) seeking 
helpful information or a welcoming 
community. Recent literature 
indicates that transgender teenagers 
who feel supported by their families 
have lower rates of depression 
and anxiety. 
47 Connections with a 
supportive online community (eg, 
the “It Gets Better” project) may be 
beneficial to teenagers who identify 
as LGBTQI, but most such programs 
have not been studied to determine 
effects and outcomes.
Research also supports the use of 
social media to foster social inclusion 
or peer-to-peer connection among 
patients who might otherwise feel 
excluded, for example, patients 
with obesity 
48 or mental illness. 
13 
Individuals with mental illness report 
greater social connectedness and 
feelings of group belonging when 
using social media in this manner, 
because they foster the ability to 
share personal stories and strategies 
for coping with challenges. 
14 The 
advantages of these connections 
include avoiding feared stigma, 
enhancing social networks, learning 
about resources from peers online, 
and gaining information and 
insight. However, risks of such 
interactions can include exposure 
to misinformation, negativity or 
hostility in communications, delays in 
seeking out traditional resources, and 
unhealthy influences.
Young adults describe the benefits 
of seeking health information 
online and through social media 
and recognize these channels as 
useful supplementary sources of 
information to health care visits. 
15 
Social media may be used to enhance 
health and wellness and promote 
healthier behaviors, such as smoking 
cessation and balanced nutrition. 
44 
However, there are a myriad of 
easily accessible Web sites and 
social networks that facilitate and 
even promote unhealthy behaviors, 
such as disordered eating. “Pro-ana” 
(anorexia nervosa) and “pro-mia 
(bulimia)” sites, for example, are 
forums in which peers actively 
support restricted eating or purging 
and frequently offer life-threatening 
suggestions and advice. 
49
Do Screen Time Limits Apply for 
Children With Disabilities Who Use 
Mobile Devices To Communicate?
An important benefit from new 
media has been the development and 
use of technology-aided interventions 
in children and adolescents with 
disabilities, particularly through 
the expanding use of assistive and 
interactive digital media to learn and 
to communicate in youth with autism 
spectrum disorder (ASD), 
 
50 physical 
disabilities, speech impairment, and 
intellectual disability to learn and 
communicate. 
51 However, because 
teenagers with ASD have higher 
rates of problematic media use, 
 
52, 
 
53 
limits still should be placed on 
entertainment media use, such 
as watching videos or playing 
gaming apps, which can represent a 
restricted interest in children with 
ASD.

some inappropriate child-directed 
content), 
 
58 a decrease in parent–child 
interaction when the TV is on, 
 
63 
and poorer family functioning in 
households with high media use. 
60
An earlier age of media use onset, 
greater cumulative hours of media 
use, and content that is not of 
high quality all are significant 
independent predictors of poor 
executive functioning (impulse 
control, self-regulation, mental 
flexibility) 
33 as well as “theory of 
mind” deficits (ie, the ability to 
understand others’ thoughts and 
feelings) in preschoolers. 
64 Media 
multitasking, once thought to be a 
pastime only of only adolescents, 
now is observed even in children 
younger than 4 years. 
13 The orienting 
response to novel stimuli is very 
strong in young children, so their 
attention is drawn to the engaging 
and quickly changing features of 
digital media, such as animation, 
sounds, and highlighted features 
they can tap and swipe. 
65 These 
features, however, may decrease 
young children’s comprehension.66 
It is unknown whether rapid shifts 
in attention to and from digital 
stimuli may have long-term effects 
on children’s attention span or 
information processing.
Because strong associations between 
violent media content and child 
aggressive behavior have been 
clearly documented, 
 
67 parents should 
continue to monitor the content of 
their children’s media. Today, more 
children own and use mobile devices 
independently, 
 
13 making monitoring 
and regulation much more difficult. 
16, 
 
68 
More research is needed on how 
parents can best supervise and guide 
their children’s media use.
Are Certain Children or Families 
More Susceptible to These Risks?
TV has been used as an “electronic 
babysitter” for decades, but recent 
evidence suggests that excessive 
media use is more likely in infants 
and toddlers with a “difficult” 
temperament 
69, 
 
70 or self-regulation 
problems. 
71 Toddlers with social-
emotional delays are more likely 
to be given a mobile device to calm 
them down, 
 
72 especially if their 
parents are facing parenting control 
challenges. However, it is not clear 
whether more “difficult” infants 
and toddlers have more positive 
or negative outcomes over time 
when exposed to longer media 
duration, which likely depends 
on content quality and other 
contextual factors. For example, 
Linebarger et al73 found that the 
quality of parenting can modify 
associations between media use and 
child development: inappropriate 
content and inconsistent parenting 
had cumulative negative effects on 
low-income preschoolers’ executive 
function, and warm parenting and 
educational content interacted to 
produce additive benefits.
Is Media Use Linked to Obesity?
High levels of media use are linked 
to obesity and cardiovascular risk 
74 
throughout the life course, but these 
associations are observed starting 
in early childhood. For example, 
heavy media use during preschool 
years is associated with small but 
significant increases in BMI, 
 
75 which 
sets the stage for greater weight gain 
later in childhood. The association 
between using ≥2 hours of media per 
day and obesity persists even after 
adjusting for children’s psychosocial 
risk factors or behavioral problems. 
76 
Research in preschoolers often uses 
a 2-hour cutoff to define excessive 
media use, but a recent study of 
2-year-olds found that BMI increased 
for every hour per week of media 
consumed. 
77 Moreover, media use 
behaviors may explain some of the 
obesity risk disparities among young 
black and Hispanic children.78 None 
of these studies examined mobile 
media specifically, which may be 
more easily used during meals and, 
therefore, distract children from 
satiety cues. 
79
Studies of older children and 
teenagers show clear correlations 
between increases in hours of TV 
viewing and higher risk of obesity. 
80 
In a 1996 study of 5- to 10-year-olds, 
the odds of being overweight were 
4.6 times greater for youth watching 
more than 5 hours of TV per day 
compared with those watching 0 to 2 
hours. 
81 This study greatly influenced 
the AAP recommendations for 2 
hours or less of sedentary screen 
time daily for children 2 through 
18 years of age. However, a more 
recent study in the Netherlands of 
children 4 through 13 years of age 
found that watching TV over 1.5 
hours per day was a significant 
risk factor for obesity. In this study, 
however, an association between 
TV and obesity was only found for 
children 4 through 9 years of age. 
82 
A large international study with almost 
300 000 children and adolescents 
found that watching between 1 and 
3 hours of TV a day led to a 10% 
to 27% increase in risk of obesity. 
83 
These more recent studies suggest 
that setting limits of TV viewing to 
between 1 and 1.5 hours a day 
may be more effective to prevent 
obesity than the 2 hours per day 
standard presented in earlier AAP 
recommendations.
Additional studies have identified 
relevant factors around TV viewing 
beyond solely the number of hours 
for families to use in developing 
household rules. Another recent 
study found that the association 
between TV viewing and obesity risk 
was only significant for children who 
were already at the higher end of 
the BMI distribution. 
84 A large study 
using a national dataset of children 
reported that it was not just the 
hours of TV viewing that predicted 
obesity, but the combination of 
low physical activity and high 
sedentary TV viewing that was most 
contributory to obesity risk. 
85 A 
2008 study directly examined the 
AAP recommendations for 2 hours 
a day or less of sedentary media 
e7

Downloaded from 
 FROM THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS
consumption and found that boys 
who exceeded 2 hours a day of 
sedentary media use were 1.7 
times more likely to be overweight 
compared with those who had 2 
hours a day or less of sedentary 
media use. The results for girls were 
much less impressive, in that girls 
with over 2 hours a day of sedentary 
media use were only 1.2 times more 
likely to be overweight compared 
with girls who had 2 hours or less of 
media use time. 
86
The association between TV viewing 
and obesity previously attributed 
to food advertising 
87 may now be 
decreased, because children watch 
more videos from streaming services 
(eg, Netflix, Hulu), which do not 
contain advertisements, but this has 
yet to be studied.
Another area of obesity risk is the 
presence of a TV in the bedroom. A 
2007 study found that having a TV 
in the bedroom was an independent 
risk factor for obesity. A more recent 
study found that the combination 
of a TV in the bedroom and greater 
use of screen time had the strongest 
association with obesity. 
88
Fortunately, studies also suggest 
that making efforts to reduce 
children’s sedentary media use 
can have positive health effects. An 
intervention study focused on third 
and fourth graders worked with the 
participants to reduce time spent 
watching TV and playing video 
games. The study demonstrated 
that children in the intervention 
group reported reduced TV viewing 
and meals in front of the TV and 
had reduced BMIs, illustrating that 
interventions to reduce sedentary 
media use can positively impact 
health behaviors as well as BMI. 
89
How Does Media Use Affect Sleep?
There is a growing body of evidence 
that suggests that media use 
negatively affects sleep. 
90 Increased 
duration of media exposure and 
the presence of a TV, computer, or 
mobile device in the bedroom in 
early childhood have been associated 
with fewer minutes of sleep per 
night, especially among children 
of racial/ethnic minority groups. 
91 
Later bedtimes after evening media 
use and violent content in the media 
also may be contributing factors, 
 
92 
and suppression of endogenous 
melatonin by blue light emitted from 
screens is another possible cause. 
93 
Associations between media and 
sleep are seen in infants as well; 6- to 
12-month-olds who were exposed to 
screen media in the evening hours 
showed significantly shorter night-
time sleep duration than those who 
had no evening screen exposure.94
Studies of older children and 
teenagers have found that 
participants with higher social media 
use 
95 or who sleep with mobile 
devices in their room 
96, 
 
97 were at 
greater risk for sleep disturbances. 
One study of adults found that taking 
a phone into the bedroom led to 
longer sleep latency, worse sleep 
quality, more sleep disturbance, 
and more daytime dysfunction. 
98 
This study illustrates the multiple 
mechanisms by which media use 
around bedtime, or during bedtime, 
can disrupt sleep and affect daytime 
function.
Bruni et al 
90 studied the use of 
technology on sleep quality in 
adolescents and preadolescents. 
Adolescents’ bad sleep quality was 
associated consistently with greater 
mobile phone use and the number 
of devices in the bedroom, and in 
preadolescents, bad sleep quality 
was associated with greater Internet 
use and later media turn-off time. 
The authors concluded that evening 
circadian preference, mobile phone 
and Internet use, the number of other 
activities engaged in after 9:00 PM, 
later media turning-off time, and the 
number of devices in the bedroom 
have different, but significant, 
negative influences on sleep quality 
in preadolescents and adolescents. 
90 
Similarly, Lemola et al 
99 reported 
associations between electronic 
media use in bed before sleep, 
sleep difficulties, and symptoms of 
depression in teenagers.
Daytime screen use may also affect 
sleep. According to a Norwegian 
study, daytime and bedtime use 
of electronic devices both affected 
sleep measures, with an increased 
risk of short sleep duration, long 
sleep onset latency, and increased 
sleep deficiency. A dose–response 
relationship emerged between 
sleep duration and use of electronic 
devices. 
100 Ensuring that children 
and teenagers obtain the necessary 
hours of healthy sleep is an 
important goal of a Family Media 
Use Plan (www. 
healthychildren. 
org/ 
MediaUsePlan).
What Are the Risks of Social Media 
Use In School-Aged Children and 
Teenagers?
The links between media and health 
behaviors among adolescents 
have been backed by decades of 
evidence in traditional media. 
101 
 
– 
104 
Studies have shown that exposure 
to alcohol or tobacco use or risky 
sexual behaviors in TV or movies is 
associated with initiation of these 
behaviors, 
101, 
 
102, 
 
105, 
 
106 leading some 
to describe TV as a “superpeer.” 
107 
A growing body of evidence suggests 
that these influences also are 
strong in digital and social media. 
Several studies have illustrated 
that adolescents’ displays on social 
media frequently include portrayal 
of risky health behaviors, such as 
illegal alcohol use or overuse, illicit 
substance use, high-risk sexual 
behaviors, and harmful behaviors, 
such as self-injury and disordered 
eating.108 
 
 
– 
112 A growing body of 
evidence suggests that peer viewers 
of this content are influenced to 
see these behaviors as normative 
and desirable.113 
– 
115 Social media 
combine the power of interpersonal 
persuasion with the reach of 
mass media. Fogg described this 
mass interpersonal persuasion as

“the most significant advance in 
persuasion since radio was invented 
in the 1890s.” 
116
Although restrictions exist to protect 
youth and children from exposure 
to alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana 
advertisements on traditional media 
platforms, such as TV, there is 
concern about the extent to which 
youth are exposed to promotion of 
these substances on social media 
Web sites from marketers or peers. 
For example, research from both 
the United States and the United 
Kingdom indicate that the major 
alcohol brands maintain a strong 
advertising presence on Facebook, 
Twitter, and YouTube. 
13, 
 
14 Targeted 
advertising via social media may 
have a significant effect on adolescent 
behavior.
How Does Media Use in School-Aged 
Children and Teenagers Relate to 
Mental Health?
Research studies have identified 
both benefits and concerns regarding 
mental health and media use. In one 
longitudinal panel survey, 396 white 
and black preadolescent boys and 
girls were assessed to determine the 
long-term effects of TV consumption 
on global self-esteem. TV exposure 
was found to be significantly related 
to self-esteem, but whether it 
increased or decreased self-esteem 
was influenced by demographic 
factors. Greater exposure resulted in a 
decrease in self-esteem for both white 
and black girls and for black boys but 
resulted in an increase in self-esteem 
for white boys. 
117 Analyzing these 
results, the authors postulate that 
the majority of the TV content served 
to reinforce both gender-role and 
racial stereotypes, which tended to 
be positive for white boys but not the 
other groups. The authors suggested 
that the black children and white 
girls could be internalizing the “social 
norms” portrayed and using these 
messages as a basis for self-evaluation, 
negatively affecting their self-esteem. 
There is also an opportunity cost 
when more TV viewing displaces 
real-life experiences that might build 
self-esteem.
The interactive and selective 
components of social media may 
offset some of these traditional media 
drawbacks, because social media 
use in moderation can enhance 
social support and connection. 
However, use in moderation and the 
specific way in which social media 
are used may be the key. Previous 
research has suggested a U-shaped 
relationship between Internet use 
and depression, with increased 
risks for depression at both the high 
and low ends of Internet use. 
118, 
 
119 
A recent study examined social 
media use and depression and found 
a positive association. 
120 Older 
adolescents who used social media 
passively by solely viewing content 
reported declines in well-being 
and life satisfaction, whereas those 
who used social media actively by 
interacting with others and posting 
content did not experience these 
declines. 
121 Another study found that 
teenagers who used Instagram to 
follow strangers and engage in social 
comparisons had higher depression 
symptoms, but others who followed 
friends and engaged in less social 
comparison had fewer depression 
symptoms.122 These studies illustrate 
that, beyond the number of hours 
spent on social media, a key factor is 
how an individual uses social media.
Do Children and Adolescents 
Understand the Privacy Risks 
Associated With Social Media Use?
An important issue across all social 
media and interactive apps is privacy, 
because content that a child or 
adolescent chooses to post on any 
site or app becomes public in some 
way. Removal of such content may 
be difficult or impossible. Previous 
work suggests that adolescents vary 
in their understanding of privacy 
practices, and even among those who 
do know how to set privacy settings, 
many choose not to do so. 
123 
– 
125 
Despite efforts by some social media 
sites to protect privacy or even to 
delete content after it is viewed, 
privacy violations and content 
sharing are always possible. 
126, 
127 
This risk illustrates the need for 
continued discussion about media 
and privacy with children and 
teenagers with parents, caregivers, 
teachers, and other responsible 
adults. These discussions should be 
included in schools through their 
digital citizenship programs and in 
pediatric well-child examinations 
with parents and teenagers. 
Pediatricians can introduce and 
work with families to develop a 
Family Media Use Plan (see the AAP 
guide to making a plan at www. 
healthychildren. 
org/ 
MediaUsePlan) 
that can mitigate or avoid such risks.
Is Cyberbullying Different From 
Traditional Bullying?
Cyberbullying is commonly defined 
as “an aggressive, intentional 
act or behavior that is carried 
out by a group or an individual, 
using electronic forms of contact, 
repeatedly and over time against a 
victim who cannot easily defend him 
or herself.” 
128 Unfortunately, there 
are many online platforms in which 
bullying may take place, including 
E-mail, blogs, social networking 
Web sites/apps, online games, 
and text messaging. There is clear 
overlap between cyberbullying and 
traditional bullying, 
 
129 but several 
features of online bullying present 
new challenges. These challenges 
include that perpetrators can 
bully at any time of day and can be 
anonymous, the rapidity with which 
information can spread online, 
 
130 
and the fluidity with which bully and 
target roles can switch in the online 
world. Estimates of the number of 
youth who experience cyberbullying 
vary, ranging from 10% to 40%, 
depending on the age group and how 
cyberbullying is defined.
Cyberbullying shares many 
similarities and a few key differences 
e9

 FROM THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS
with traditional bullying. For 
example, victims of cyberbullying 
often do not know who the bully is 
or why they are being targeted, the 
hurtful actions of a cyberbully can 
reach a child or teenager anytime 
he or she uses a smartphone or 
computer (so there is no safe haven 
of home), and the bullying messages 
can also spread virally through the 
Internet to many other people at 
school or in the community, making 
this type of bullying potentially very 
embarrassing and lasting.
Descriptive research has shown 
that vulnerable populations exist 
and are more likely to be targeted 
for bullying. Youths identifying 
as LGBTQI are more likely to be 
victimized in bullying dynamics 
and are at risk online as well. 
131 
Children and adolescents with 
ASD are a population particularly 
vulnerable to bullying (https:// 
www. 
autismspeaks. 
org/ 
family- 
services/ 
bullying) and could easily be a target 
for cyberbullying. The 2016 National 
Academies of Sciences, Engineering, 
and Medicine report, “Preventing 
Bullying Through Science, Policy, 
and Practice, 
” 
132 addressed the 
concept of populations vulnerable 
to bullying to propose that there is a 
need for research that moves beyond 
descriptive studies and labeling of 
youth as vulnerable and considers 
processes that can explain why 
individuals may have differences 
in their bullying experiences and 
consequences depending on their 
context.
Previous studies have examined the 
negative effects that cyberbullying 
can have on both bullies and 
victims. Victims are more likely 
to report lower grades and other 
academic problems as a result of the 
experience. Similar to traditional 
bullying, cyberbullying can lead to 
short- and long-term 
133, 
 
134 negative 
social, academic, and health 
134 
– 
137 
consequences for both the 
perpetrator and target. Both bullies 
and victims often report higher 
levels of depression and lower self-
esteem. Victims were at higher risk 
of both suicidal ideation and suicide 
attempts.
Fortunately, newer studies suggest 
that interventions targeting bullying 
also may reduce cyberbullying. 
138 
Moreno states: “Parents can play 
a role in preventing cyberbullying 
by educating their children about 
appropriate online behaviors. Parents 
should have discussions early and 
often about their child’s friendships 
and relationships to develop and 
maintain open communication 
about these topics.” 
139 The Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention 
panel reviewing effective prevention 
strategies recommends media 
literacy education as a “promising 
approach, 
” along with collaborative 
strategies among teenagers, parents, 
and schools that encourage victims to 
report cyberbullying and seek adult 
support. 
140
What Is Sexting and How Can the 
Risks of Sexting Be Avoided or 
Addressed?
Sexting is a serious issue in 
adolescence. Sexting is commonly 
defined as the electronic 
transmission of nude or seminude 
images as well as sexually explicit 
text messages. 
111 It is estimated that 
approximately 12% of youth 10 to 19 
years of age have ever sent a sexual 
photo to someone else 
112; sadly, 
many youth who have participated in 
sexting report having felt pressured 
into sending a sext. When dealing 
with youth and sexting, adults, 
authorities, and schools need to be 
aware that the situation may be more 
complicated.
Spencer et al 
141 examined sexting 
and youth in an urban population; 
55 youth presenting for care at the 
Teen Health Center at Children’s 
Hospital Los Angeles were surveyed 
to evaluate prevalence and sexting 
behaviors, such as forwarding sexts, 
reasons for sending sexts, and youths’ 
concerns regarding sexting. Of those 
surveyed, 48.5% of girls and 63.6% 
of boys had sent a sext, and 70% of 
girls and 82% of boys had received 
a sext. The authors report that girls 
expressed significantly more concern 
than boys about how sexting could 
affect their reputation, including 
getting caught by an adult with a sext 
and how others would think of them. 
Fortunately, 52% of respondents said 
they would be comfortable talking 
with their doctor about sexting. 
Pediatricians may, therefore, find 
their teen patients receptive to a 
conversation about sexting and its 
implications and risks.
Ybarra and Mitchell, in their article, 
“‘Sexting’ and its relation to sexual 
activity and sexual risk behavior in a 
national survey of adolescents, 
” 
142 
suggest that sexting is related to 
behaviors indicative of psychosocial 
challenge and risky sexual behavior 
for some youth. Significant findings 
include a higher frequency of sexting 
among females and lesbian, gay, 
and bisexual youth. Additionally, 
a greater number of past-year sex 
partners and a greater odds of 
depression and substance abuse 
were found among teenagers who 
sext.
Findings related to lesbian, gay, and 
bisexual populations are consistent 
with previous studies on sexting; 
of note, transgender youth were 
not included. Earlier research 
had demonstrated a significant 
association between sexting and 
risky sexual behaviors in lesbian, gay, 
bisexual, and transgender youth. 
142
Ybarra and Mitchell’s study 
142 found 
that sexting was indicative of sexual 
activity and risky sexual behaviors, 
and further research may identify 
predictive outcomes of sexting. 
One study suggests that sexting 
may precede sexual intercourse. 
142 
The predictive value of a sexting 
history may inform sex education 
and HEEADSSS (home, education 
& employment, eating, activities, 
drugs, sexuality, suicide/depression,

and safety) assessments. Moreover, 
discussions between pediatricians 
and teenagers about sexting may 
indicate risky sexual behaviors and 
a number of psychosocial issues, 
such as depression, anxiety, and 
low self-esteem, that may be further 
addressed.
Temple et al 
143 examined whether 
adolescents who report sexting 
exhibited more psychosocial health 
problems than their nonsexting 
counterparts. The authors reported 
that teen sexting was significantly 
associated with symptoms of 
depression, impulsivity, and 
substance use. When adjusted for 
previous sexual behavior, age, 
gender, race/ethnicity, and parent 
education, however, sexting was only 
related to impulsivity and substance 
use. The authors concluded that 
“while teen sexting appears to 
correlate with impulsive and high-
risk behaviors (substance use), we 
did not find sexting to be a marker of 
mental health.” 
143
Sexting is a behavior that will 
likely continue and expand with 
technologic advances that make 
photography and communication 
more accessible. Active debate 
continues regarding the ethical 
and legal components of sexting, 
especially among underage youth. 
Concerns include the identification 
of sexts as pornography or sexual 
misconduct. Even consensual, 
noncoercive sexting may result in 
criminal prosecution that may lead to 
long-term legal consequences.
Addressing risky sexual behaviors 
and psychological symptoms 
associated with sexting through 
education and guidance should 
help to promote wellness and 
responsibility within adolescent 
populations. Further research 
evaluating sexting among 
gender minority populations (eg, 
transgender adolescents) also 
will be valuable in understanding 
and discouraging the behavior 
and providing safer and less risky 
alternatives for social connections.
CHILD PORNOGRAPHY AND CHILD 
ABUSE
How Has Social Media Changed the 
Landscape of Child Pornography and 
Child Abuse?
Unfortunately, the Internet has 
also created opportunities for 
the exploitation of children by 
sex offenders. Online predators 
can gain access to children and 
teenagers through social networking, 
chat rooms, E-mail, and online 
games. Cases of child trafficking, 
cybergrooming, and sexual abuse 
for private and commercial 
purposes have increased with the 
help of the anonymous cyberspace 
environment. For example, online 
grooming leads to establishment of 
a trusting relationship, often with 
the perpetrator misrepresenting 
himself as another child or teenager. 
This developing online relationship 
may lead to sexting or to convincing 
the child to meet the perpetrator in 
person. Children may be deceived, 
tricked, or coerced into engaging 
in sexual acts for the production 
of child sexual abuse materials 
(child pornography), which then 
can circulate online for years to 
come. Child sexual abuse images 
often involve young and very young 
children. Of 43 597 children assessed 
in sexual abuse images and videos, 
49.6% appeared to have a sexual 
maturity rating of 1, and 28.7% 
appeared to have a sexual maturity 
rating of 2. 
144 Besides the adverse 
effects associated with child sexual 
abuse, 
 
145, 
 
146 victims who have had 
online sexual images (pornography 
and sexting) posted may experience 
significant anxiety and stress related 
to knowledge that the abuse images 
may be downloaded and viewed by 
millions of people for an indefinite 
period of time. Thus, the exploitation 
continues for months and years after 
the images were obtained. 
144
Online child sexual exploitation 
also may involve recruitment and 
advertisement of children for 
prostitution and other forms of 
exploitation. 
147 The Internet may 
be used by human traffickers to 
facilitate movement of victims and to 
manage a criminal network. 
148
Internet-initiated sex crimes 
involving offenders who meet and 
groom children online tend to involve 
adolescents rather than very young 
children: 99% of victims in one 
study were 13 to 17 years old, and 
48% were 13 to 14 years old. Many 
of these crimes involve face-to-face 
sexual contact, which the victim 
perceives as “consensual.” Sexual 
relationships in early adolescence 
are associated with an increased risk 
of social, academic, and behavioral 
adverse outcomes. 
149, 
 
150
Research has shown that parents 
underestimate the likelihood that 
their child might engage in online 
conversation with people they do 
not know. Therefore, it is critical 
that parents promote online safety 
with their children from an early age, 
monitor children’s Internet use, and 
use tools, such as parental control 
software, to maintain awareness 
of their child’s online activities. 
151 
Pediatricians should consider 
asking appropriate questions to 
explore this possibility and to 
educate youth about protecting 
themselves from exploitation. All 
health care professionals should 
report any suspicions of sexual 
abuse/exploitation as per child abuse 
reporting laws.
USE OF MEDIA BY PARENTS AND 
CAREGIVERS
What Effect Does Parent Media Use 
Have on Young and School-Aged 
Children and Teenagers?
Parents and caregivers play an 
important role in modeling optimal 
behaviors for their children in 
general, including when it comes to 
e11

Downloaded from 
 FROM THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS
the consumption and use of media. 
The growth of digital and social 
media, particularly in the last 5 
years, has seen dramatic increases in 
adults’ use of social media as well as 
use by children and teenagers; more 
than 70% of adults now use social 
media 
152 and 27% report feeling 
“addicted” to their mobile devices. 
7 
Social media can provide positive 
social experiences for adults, such as 
opportunities for parents to connect 
with their child in a college dorm 
via video-chatting services. Such 
services also can promote social and 
emotional connection among distant 
relatives or deployed parents and 
children. However, some parents can, 
themselves, overuse digital media. 
For example, research has shown that 
parents’ own TV viewing distracts 
from parent–child interactions 
153 and 
children’s play. 
154 Children younger 
than 2 years are more likely to be 
exposed to and watch inappropriate 
“background” media (eg, TV) than 
older children.155 Heavy parent 
use of mobile devices is associated 
with fewer verbal and nonverbal 
interactions between parents and 
children 
156 and may be associated 
with more parent–child conflict. 
157 
Because parent media use is a strong 
predictor of child media habits, 
 
158 
reducing parental TV viewing, 
including “background” TV, and 
enhancing parent–child interactions 
may be an important area of behavior 
change that pediatricians can help 
to facilitate. Because parent–child 
interactions during family routines 
are an important opportunity for 
emotional connection, have been 
shown to be protective of child 
health outcomes, such as asthma and 
high-risk behavior, 
 
159 and are the 
primary driver of early childhood 
development of language, cognition, 
social skills, and emotion regulation, 
it is important to preserve them. 
Parents often report feeling that 
technology speeds up their lives 
and work demands 
160 and that it 
is difficult to multitask between 
technology and childrearing, so 
pediatric providers can support 
their efforts to create boundaries 
and “unplugged” zones in their 
households.
THE FAMILY MEDIA USE PLAN
 
• How can pediatric health care 
providers help families use media 
in healthy ways?
 
• What is the AAP Family Media Use 
Plan?
Pediatricians and other pediatric 
health care professionals can be 
helpful resources for families seeking 
specific advice about how to develop 
and individualize family rules and 
guidelines to meet their distinct 
needs. Unfortunately, only 16% of 
pediatricians ask families about 
their media use. In addition, only 
29% of parents report relying on 
their pediatrician for advice about 
broadcast and social media, although 
those who do tend to follow AAP 
recommendations. 
161
When discussing media use with 
families, pediatric health care 
providers can print out and help 
families begin completing the AAP 
Family Media Use Plan (www. 
healthychildren. 
org/ 
MediaUsePlan). 
Providers can discuss with parents 
and developmentally ready children 
how each of the media-specific 
behaviors and health concerns can be 
addressed through practical, family-
centered approaches. The Family 
Media Use Plan can act as a teaching 
tool through which pediatricians 
can provide information about the 
benefits and health risks of both 
traditional and new media. The 
potential risks of interactive media, 
such as reduced physical activity, 
inadequate sleep, and unhealthy 
influences like cyberbullying and 
weight bias, are important to discuss 
with families as well.
The plan also can be a tool through 
which the pediatrician can explore 
and understand each family’s values 
and health goals—for example, how 
good nutrition, an active lifestyle, 
good sleep hygiene, parent–child 
emotional connection, and creative 
play fit into the family’s typical day—
and identify areas in which good 
health and wellness can be enhanced. 
Pediatricians can suggest ways in 
which media can be used to connect, 
learn, and create instead of simply 
consume.
These discussions can also allow 
pediatric health care providers to 
consider screening for problematic 
Internet use and Internet gaming 
disorder using validated tools, such 
as the Internet Gaming Disorder 
scale (https:// 
www. 
researchgate. 
net/ 
publication/ 
270652917_ 
The_ 
Internet_ 
Gaming_ 
Disorder_ 
Scale) and 
the Problematic and Risky Internet 
Use Screening Scale (http://

g. 
net/ 
p/ 
kplu/ 
files/ 
201502/ 
PRIUSS_ 
scale_ 
and_ 
guidelines. 
pdf).
If challenges in implementing a 
media use plan are anticipated, 
pediatric health care providers can 
consider introducing motivational 
interviewing or engaging in problem 
solving with parents and children 
about possible solutions. The 
pediatrician has an opportunity to 
discuss specific tools to address 
identified family needs and concerns, 
including social services and 
community resources, if needed. 
Finally, the pediatrician may be able 
to provide families with referrals 
to educational and informational 
resources, such as vetted Web sites 
(eg, www. 
HealthyChildren. 
org).
CONCLUSIONS
New digital and social media 
facilitate and promote social 
interactions as well as participation 
and engagement that involve both 
viewing and creating content. The 
effects of media use, however, are 
multifactorial and depend on the

type of media, the type of use, the 
amount and extent of use, and the 
characteristics of the individual 
child or adolescent using the media. 
Children today are growing up 
in an era of highly personalized 
media use experiences; therefore, 
parents should be encouraged to 
develop personalized Family Media 
Use Plans for their families that 
attend to each child’s age, health, 
temperament, and developmental 
stage and ensure that each child 
can practice and benefit from the 
essentials for healthy growth and 
development, such as a healthy 
diet, good sleep hygiene, adequate 
physical activity, and positive social 
interactions.
Parents should recognize and 
understand their own roles in 
modeling appropriate media use 
and balance between media time 
and other activities. Pediatricians 
can help families identify and 
adopt a healthy Family Media Use 
Plan, minimize unhealthy habits 
and behaviors, and recognize and 
address issues that occur related 
to the use of traditional and new 
media that can negatively affect 
health, wellness, social and personal 
development, and academic 
performance and success.
