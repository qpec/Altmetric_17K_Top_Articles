 The Convention on the Rights of the 
Child (CRC), which was adopted by 
the United Nations (UN) in 1989, 
is the most widely ratified human 
rights treaty in history: all 197 UN 
countries except the United States 
are parties.‍1 The CRC establishes 
the rights of children, emphasizing 
children’s rights to life (article 6), 
health (article 24), education (articles 
28 and 29), and protection from 
the use of harmful drugs (article 
33) and exploitative activities that 
harm their wellbeing (article 36).‍2 
The serious and widespread impact 
of tobacco use on children’s health, 
the tobacco industry’s exploitative 
marketing practices, and the use 
of child labor in tobacco growing3 
make the CRC a potentially powerful 
tobacco control tool, as acknowledged 
by several public health and human-
rights advocates.‍4– 
6 The CRC also 
complements the 2005 World Health 
Organization (WHO) Framework 
Convention on Tobacco Control 
(FCTC), which is the UN tobacco 
control treaty.‍7
The FCTC was negotiated from 1999 
to 2003 by the WHO8 and its member 
states.‍ At that time, the United Nations 
Children’s Fund (UNICEF), which is 
the world’s leading authority on CRC 
implementation, was working with the 
WHO to promote tobacco control from 
a children’s rights perspective, and 
was involved in FCTC negotiations.‍ In

The manufacture, use, and marketing of tobacco present a serious threat 
to children’s right to health.‍ This makes the Convention on the Rights 
of the Child a potentially powerful tobacco-control tool and the United 
Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), which oversees the convention’s 
implementation, a potential leader in tobacco control.‍ UNICEF actively 
supported tobacco control initiatives in the late 1990s, but since the early 
2000s UNICEF’s role in tobacco control has been minimal.‍ Using the Truth 
Tobacco Industry Documents library, an online collection of previously 
secret tobacco industry documents, we sought to uncover information on 
the tobacco industry’s ties with UNICEF.‍ We found that from 1997 to 2000, 
when UNICEF was actively promoting tobacco control to support children’s 
rights, the tobacco industry saw children’s rights and UNICEF as potentially 
powerful threats to business that needed to be closely monitored and 
neutralized.‍ The industry then positioned itself as a partner with UNICEF 
on youth smoking prevention initiatives as a way to avoid meaningful 
tobacco control measures that could save children’s lives.‍ After UNICEF’s 
corporate engagement guidelines were loosened in 2003, tobacco companies 
successfully engaged with UNICEF directly and via front groups, including 
the Eliminating Child Labour in Tobacco Growing Foundation.‍ This was 
part of an overall tobacco industry strategy to improve its corporate image, 
infiltrate the United Nations, and weaken global tobacco-control efforts.‍ 
As part of its mission to protect children’s rights, UNICEF should end all 
partnerships with the tobacco industry and its front groups.‍

Downloaded from 
 the late 1990s, UNICEF saw its role 
in tobacco control as a children’s 
rights obligation and called for 
tobacco advertising bans, 
9, 
 
10 raising 
tobacco taxes, and health education11 
and initiated joint youth smoking 
prevention (YSP) projects with the 
WHO.‍12, 
 
13 Children’s rights were 
a theme in international tobacco-
control meetings, 
14 
– 
18 and in 2001, 
the WHO and UNICEF published 
a joint report on tobacco and 
children’s rights in which they 
emphasized the need to protect 
children from smoking initiation, 
secondhand smoke exposure, tobacco 
marketing, and labor on tobacco 
farms.‍3 Since the FCTC entered into 
force in 2005, however, UNICEF has 
maintained a low profile in tobacco 
control, 
19 although tobacco is a 
well-established cause of low birth 
weight, prematurity, and other risks 
to child survival20 and a substantial 
contributor to child poverty, food 
insecurity, and preventable diseases 
and deaths20, 
 
21; also, most smokers 
initiate in youth as a result of 
targeted tobacco advertising.‍22
Starting in the late 1990s, tobacco 
companies executed an elaborate 
strategy to infiltrate the UN, discredit 
the WHO, and weaken global 
tobacco-control movements23 
– 
25 
by presenting themselves as 
reasonable partners.‍26 Tobacco 
companies hired Mongoven, Biscoe, 
and Duchin (MBD), which is a firm 
that specializes in breaking down 
advocacy campaigns.‍27 MBD advised 
the industry to participate in the 
FCTC treaty process and cultivate 
alliances with nongovernmental 
organizations (NGOs), 
25 UN agencies 
(eg, the Economic and Social Council, 
International Labour Organization, 
and the United Nations Global 
Compact [UNGC]), 
26, 
 
28 and UN 
officials then use these alliances and 
access to gain influence, information, 
and an image of credibility.‍26, 
29 
The industry also sought to refocus 
the FCTC on YSP.‍24, 
 
30 Tobacco 
industry–funded YSP initiatives30 
–32 
are ineffective at reducing smoking 
prevalence30 
– 
33 because they 
portray smoking as an adult choice 
while providing tobacco companies 
with good publicity, access to 
policymakers, 
33 and opportunities to 
undermine tobacco regulations.‍24
We show how the tobacco industry 
engaged with UNICEF and children’s 
rights from 1997 to 2016 in an 
attempt to neutralize UNICEF’s 
antitobacco advocacy and infiltrate 
the UN as part of the industry’s 
strategy to weaken the FCTC.‍
METHODS
We searched internal tobacco 
industry documents in the Truth 
Tobacco Industry Documents library 
(https:// 
www.‍ 
industrydocuments 
library.‍ 
ucsf.‍ 
edu/ 
tobacco/ 
), which 
is a publicly accessible, online 
library of previously secret tobacco 
industry documents that were 
mostly released through litigation 
against tobacco companies, from 
January 2017 through April 2017 
using standard snowball search 
techniques, 
34 starting with the 
search terms “Convention on the 
Rights of the Child” and “UNICEF.‍” 
We conducted follow-up searches 
with adjacent documents (by Bates 
numbers) and names of individuals, 
organizations, and events mentioned 
in the documents.‍ We retrieved 2555 
documents.‍ Filtering out duplicates 
and irrelevant documents, such 
as unrelated news articles citing 
UNICEF studies, yielded 25 unique 
documents for this analysis.‍
We conducted additional searches 
in news archives (eg, NewsBank and 
Google News) using the search terms 
“UNICEF AND tobacco” and “UNICEF 
AND Philip Morris” on the Web sites 
of Philip Morris International (PMI), 
Japan Tobacco International (JTI), 
British American Tobacco (BAT), 
and the Eliminating Child Labour in 
Tobacco Growing Foundation (ECLT) 
using the search terms “UNICEF” 
and “child rights” and on the UNICEF 
Web site using the search term 
“tobacco.‍”
RESULTS
Ideas for a “Youth Treaty” 
Alternative to the WHO FCTC, 
1997–1998
In a November 1997 report prepared 
for Philip Morris International 
(PMI), an MBD employee35 (Table 1) 
discussed how the WHO had finished 
its preparations for negotiating 
the FCTC and how, according to 
MBD, a FCTC treaty was “virtually 
inevitable.‍” In the report, a strategy 
was described for delaying the 
crafting and adoption of the FCTC, 
which would include PMI positioning 
itself as a partner with the WHO on 
YSP.‍ MBD35 recommended that “it 
would be in the company’s interest 
to have the treaty focus entirely on 
protecting children and leaving adult 
choice protected.‍” In a May 1998 
e-mail to Denise Keane (general 
counsel at PMI), David Bushong (of 
corporate affairs at PMI) discussed 
these ideas further:
It appears increasingly likely that we 
could overtly promote a global level 
playing field to protect kids. That could 
amplify/multiply our [Kazakh]-style youth 
programs…[and] work with those staffers 
and member states who…might want to 
moderate the scope of any [FCTC]-type 
action. 
37
The Kazakh-style youth program 
was a YSP program, Right Decisions 
Right Now, that PMI was running in 
South Kazakhstan in May 1998.‍36 
The program was part of a joint 
YSP initiative between PMI, British 
American Tobacco (BAT), Japan 
Tobacco International (JTI), and RJ 
Reynolds International51 in regions 
such as the Americas to counter more 
effective youth access and tobacco 
marketing restrictions.‍33, 
 
52 Tobacco 
industry reports and presentations 
reveal that tobacco companies were 
also planning to use the Kazakh 
program to establish connections

In a June 1998 report, Bushong38 
further discussed how PMI could “get 
 
a seat at – or as close as possible – to  
the [FCTC negotiations] table” 
and “foster the perception among 
others at the table that we are a 
credible, committed player” by 
pushing its agenda on protecting 
children.‍ Bushong38 argued that 
“making the youth arguments…
engenders rationality, slows the 
pace and moderates the content 
of any WHO action.‍” In a July 1998 
e-mail to his colleagues at PMI, 
Bushong40 also suggested that as part 
of PMI’s strategy for undermining 
the FCTC, “we could further develop 
the feasibility/efficacy of drafting 
a ‘youth treaty’ alternative to the 
[FCTC], 
” although he recognized that 
this idea would be risky because it 
might become “a floor from which 
the WHO et al negotiate upward.‍”
Children’s Rights: “A Potential 
Opportunity and Complication, 
” 1998
Meanwhile, MBD warned PMI 
of the risk posed by UNICEF’s 
substantial potential to boost global 
tobacco-control efforts.‍ In a July 1998 
memorandum to Matthew Winokur 
(public affairs director at PMI) and 
Bushong, Jack Mongoven (of MBD) 
wrote:
…the [CRC] holds the potential for 
becoming a vehicle for international 
and domestic anti-tobacco activists and 
international agencies…to impose severe 
restrictions on the tobacco industry 
in the name of children. It is one more 
weapon in the anti-tobacco activists’ 
[armamentarium] and should be 
monitored closely. 
39
In a 1998 report on the CRC prepared 
for PMI, those at MBD further 
discussed how tobacco-control 
advocates might “exploit” provisions 
in the CRC covering children’s 
health and child exploitation and 
advised those at PMI to monitor the 
activities of the NGOs involved in 
“education and health issues, which 
could be broadly applied in specific 
areas of tobacco control through 
[the] regulation of advertising and 
other restrictions.‍” 
55 In an August 
1998 memorandum to Winokur and 
Bushong, Mongoven further detailed 
the role of UNICEF in facilitating 
the implementation of the CRC.‍ 
Those at MBD41 described UNICEF 
as the leading authority over CRC 
implementation, with “significant 
power and influence over policy 
formulation in many countries” 
and “substantial standing with 
communications media worldwide.‍” 
Mongoven advised:
UNICEF should be monitored closely as 
the move for a [FCTC] advances.… Given 
its history and current activities on anti-
tobacco programs, it appears more than 
likely that UNICEF will see a chance to 
enhance its world role by involving itself 
as a major promoter in the framework 
convention process by citing its authority 
under [the] CRC. 
41
Those at MBD41 also stressed 
that, given UNICEF’s role in local 
initiatives, “it is vital to understand 
the role of the country offices and 
national committees.‍”
Bushong40 concluded that the CRC 
was “both a potential opportunity 
and complication.‍” In a September

www.aappublications.org/news
Downloaded from 
 1998 memorandum to Keane and 
David Greenberg (vice president 
of government affairs at PMI), 
Winokur discussed how the FCTC 
developments could provide an 
opportunity for PMI to promote its 
YSP agenda as a “common ground” 
between the WHO and PMI by using 
the CRC as “an avenue to engage 
in dialogue on means to prevent 
underage smoking.‍” 
42 A note in the 
PMI records (no identified author 
or date) reveals that those at PMI 
planned to first survey attitudes 
about the FCTC among “staff of key 
stakeholders in UN system, 
” which 
included entities such as UNICEF, 
“with an interest in [the] rights of the 
child and which might take away our 
common ground approach to advance 
their own agenda.‍” 
43 We could not 
determine whether the survey was 
implemented.‍
Plans to Engage With the WHO and 
Other Stakeholders, 1999–2000
In a February 1999 presentation, a 
PMI employee (unknown author) 
outlined a plan to write a letter to 
then-WHO Director General Dr Gro 
Harlem Brundtland to promote a 
“common ground” on YSP between 
the WHO and PMI.‍ Brundtland 
was a driving force for the FCTC 
negotiations and had a strong 
antitobacco industry stance, so 
tobacco companies considered her 
a significant threat.‍19 In a March 
1999 report located in PMI records 
(unknown author), 
45 it was further 
detailed how the WHO relied on the 
perception of the tobacco industry 
as “uncompromising, ruthless, 
unreasonable and predatory” to 
justify stronger FCTC measures, so 
PMI’s approach was to engage with 
the WHO on YSP to position itself as a 
reasonable partner.‍
Those at PMI expected that engaging 
with the WHO would also complement 
its ongoing YSP programs and afford 
opportunities to openly disagree 
with certain restrictions proposed 
in the WHO FCTC: “our legitimate 
viewpoints could be paid more 
attention to on a national level due 
to our active, committed stance and 
cooperation for example in the area 
of underage smoking prevention.‍” 
45 
However, the real objective of those 
at PMI was “to see that any tobacco 
control treaty, if adopted, secures a 
level playing field.‍” 
45 Those at PMI56, 
 
57 
 
sent a letter, together with formal 
public comments, to Brundtland in 
August 2000 offering to engage with 
the WHO on minimum-age laws and 
marketing restrictions to protect 
children while preserving the “adult 
choice” to smoke.‍
Those at the BAT also saw the value 
of engaging with UN agencies, NGOs, 
and other stakeholders on YSP.‍ In a 
September 2000 report for public 
discussion on YSP, a BAT employee46 
(unknown author) asserted that YSP 
was a common ground between the 
BAT and public health advocates and 
that they should “put aside politics 
and preconceived opinion, and take 
that brave step and co-operate.‍” The 
BAT employee46 quoted children’s 
rights obligations under CRC articles 
17 (children’s right to information) 
and 18 (parental duties to protect 
children’s best interests) to argue 
that these obligations meant children 
<18 years old should not smoke 
and that governments, public health 
groups, and the BAT should work 
together on YSP.‍ In the report, 
the BAT employee46 also claimed 
that it had worked with UNICEF in 
Africa and South America on child 
labor–prevention programs.‍ We 
could not find evidence of a direct 
collaboration between the BAT and 
UNICEF at the time, although the BAT 
may have established a connection 
with UNICEF in these regions via the 
industry's Eliminating Child Labour 
in Tobacco Growing Foundation 
(ECLT).‍
Tobacco Industry Engagement With 
UNICEF via ECLT, 2003–2016
BAT established the ECLT58 in 2000 
and recruited 13 tobacco companies, 
including JTI, BAT, and PMI, to fund 
it.‍ The ECLT59 is well networked with 
NGOs, such as Save the Children, 
and UN agencies, such as the 
International Labour Organization, 
and is a member of the UNGC.‍60
The ECLT47 has engaged with UNICEF 
on child labor since at least 2003.‍ 
From 2003 to 2005, the ECLT funded 
a program nominally to prevent 
child labor in tobacco growing in the 
Philippines, with UNICEF performing 
an advisory function.‍61 In a 2005 
child labor resource guide, the United 
Kingdom Committee for UNICEF, 
which supports and raises money 
for UNICEF there, listed the ECLT 
as an organization to contact about 
combating child labor, revealing 
the possibility that this committee 
viewed the ECLT as a credible source 
of information.‍62 A 2006 UNICEF 
Mozambique63 report featured a case 
study conducted and prepared by 
the ECLT on child labor in tobacco 
farms, which reveals that the ECLT 
was perceived as a legitimate 
source of information by UNICEF’s 
Mozambique country office.‍
Authors of ECLT news releases from 
2013 to 2016 boast about the ECLT’s 
support of children’s rights64 and 
detail how the ECLT engaged with 
UNICEF and other UN agencies and 
children’s rights groups.‍ The ECLT65, 
 
66 
was listed participating in the  
second annual UN Forum on Business 
and Human Rights (December 
2013 in Geneva), the CRC’s 25-year 
anniversary (November 2014), and 
the first session of the Specialized 
Technical Committee on Social 
Development, Labor and Employment 
of the African Union Commission 
(April 2015 in Addis Ababa).‍67 ECLT68 
also attended events in Uganda to 
celebrate the July 2016 World Day 
Against Child Labor.‍ We do not know 
the outcome of these engagements.‍
Direct Tobacco Industry Engagement 
With UNICEF, 2010–2015

Downloaded from 
 from PMI to build community 
educational spaces for tobacco 
farmers’ children.‍ A 2015 report 
published by UNICEF, 
49 in which 
obligations for and actions on 
children’s rights in business practice 
are discussed, has a JTI employee 
listed as a contributing author.‍ The 
report includes a brief analysis of 
CRC article 6 (children’s right to 
life), but obligations under article 
6 to protect children from smoking 
initiation and secondhand smoke 
exposure are not discussed.‍49
UNICEF Guidelines on Partnerships 
With the Tobacco Industry
In 2001, UNICEF adopted guidelines 
that rejected all partnerships with 
tobacco companies or organizations 
affiliated with tobacco companies.‍ 
These guidelines were loosened 
in 2003 as part of an overall UN 
corporate engagement strategy, 
with potential partnerships to 
be assessed on the basis of the 
nature of the partnership rather 
than having a blanket prohibition 
of UNICEF working with certain 
business sectors, including tobacco.‍69 
As of December 2017, UNICEF70 
welcomed corporate partnerships 
and did not specifically exclude 
tobacco companies as part of 
UNICEF’s role in helping businesses 
support children’s rights in the 
context of business activities and 
relationships.‍71
DISCUSSION
The tobacco industry considered 
UNICEF and the CRC as important 
threats because of their potential 
to bolster global tobacco-control 
movements and the FCTC.‍ The 
industry aimed to neutralize this 
threat by positioning itself as a 
partner with UNICEF and focusing 
on issues that tobacco companies 
could nominally support: notably, 
YSP and fighting child labor.‍ These 
corporate social responsibility 
initiatives are not genuine attempts 
at ethical business practice but 
political tools to improve the tobacco 
industry’s credibility, gain allies and 
access to policymakers, 
72 and avoid 
the isolation of tobacco companies 
from policy decisions.‍73 Tobacco 
industry–funded YSP programs do 
not meaningfully address youth 
smoking.‍30, 
 
32, 
33 Tobacco companies 
have also failed to take meaningful 
steps to prevent child labor, such as 
enforcing a policy to not purchase 
tobacco grown by using child labor 
or having third parties perform 
audits on farms from which they 
buy tobacco leaves.‍ Instead, they 
have invested in projects that only 
marginally address the issue, such 
as building schools and wells.‍29 In 
this case, they were also used by the 
industry as part of efforts to engage 
with the UN, weaken the FCTC into 
a “youth treaty, 
” and ultimately, 
undermine global tobacco control.‍
The tobacco industry targets 
children in its marketing and works 
to undermine the FCTC26, 
 
74 and 
thereby violates children’s rights 
to life (CRC article 6), health (CRC 
article 24), and protection from the 
use of harmful drugs (CRC article 
33) and exploitation (CRC article 
36).‍ In advertising their support of 
children’s rights, tobacco companies 
focus on YSP and child labor, which 
distracts attention from the tobacco 
industry’s responsibility to comply 
with effective tobacco control 
measures.‍75 
– 
78 This distraction tactic 
may partly explain why the CRC is 
not used more often to promote 
tobacco control and why UNICEF’s 
involvement in tobacco control has 
been minimal since the early 2000s.‍
In 2012, UNICEF launched its 
Children’s Rights and Business 
Principles79 to increase the 
visibility of children’s rights in 
business practices.‍ The principles 
were intended to give businesses 
indications on how to minimize 
negative impacts on children 
wrought by their practices.‍ Tobacco 
companies inherently violate these 
principles because their business 
depends on selling tobacco, which 
is a deadly and addictive product, 
and on resisting policies that save 
children’s lives, including smoke-free 
laws, marketing restrictions, and 
tobacco taxation.‍74
Other UN agencies are limiting 
their partnerships with tobacco 
companies.‍80 
– 
82 In September 2017, 
the UNGC50 excluded all tobacco 
companies from participation, and 
the FCTC secretariat83 warned 
member states to avoid all 
partnerships with the Foundation 
for a Smoke-Free World, which is a 
nonprofit set up with a $1 billion fund 
from PMI.‍ UNICEF, in acknowledging 
that tobacco business fundamentally 
conflicts with UNICEF’s core 
principles, should revise its corporate 
engagement guidelines to exclude all 
interaction with the tobacco industry, 
including its third parties and front 
groups.‍ NGOs and the public health 
community should highlight the issue 
and put pressure on UNICEF, as they 
have done with other UN agencies 
and organizations that work with 
them, to cease its partnerships with 
the tobacco industry and take a more 
proactive approach to protecting 
children from tobacco.‍50, 
 
84 They 
should also encourage the use of the 
CRC as a tobacco-control tool.‍
Organizations working closely with 
UNICEF to protect children’s rights 
should also cease all interactions 
with tobacco companies.‍ The Danish 
Institute for Human Rights (DIHR), 
85 
– 
87 
 
for example, collaborated with 
UNICEF from 2013 to 2015 on 
projects to align business practices 
with children’s rights.‍88, 
89 In 2016, 
the DIHR90 started a joint project 
with PMI, but the DIHR ended its 
engagement with PMI in 2017 
after it was criticized by the public 
health community.‍84 The DIHR, 
91 in 
articulating its reasons for ending 
its engagement with PMI, stated 
that “the production and marketing 
of tobacco is irreconcilable with 
the human right to health” and that

 business and human rights would 
require the cessation of all tobacco 
marketing and production.‍
The main data source for this 
article was the Truth Tobacco 
Industry Documents library, 
which is an incomplete collection 
based on documents produced 
through litigations against tobacco 
companies.‍92, 
 
93 Information was 
particularly incomplete on events 
after 2003, including tobacco industry 
attempts to reach out to UNICEF and 
whether the PMI strategy described 
was part of a broader initiative 
involving other tobacco companies 
(eg, Project Cerberus).‍24 To address 
these limitations, information was 
also sourced from news Web sites, 
tobacco industry Web sites, and 
UNICEF’s Web site.‍ We did not 
conduct interviews with current or 
past UNICEF staff or tobacco industry 
staff.‍
CONCLUSIONS
From 2003 to 2016, tobacco 
companies successfully engaged 
with UNICEF on children’s rights 
issues, during which time UNICEF 
stopped promoting children’s 
rights as a justification for tobacco 
control.‍ This engagement followed 
UNICEF weakening its corporate 
engagement guidelines, which 
created opportunities for tobacco 
companies to partner with UNICEF.‍ 
On the surface, tobacco companies 
promote themselves as champions 
of children’s rights, whereas in 
internal communications, the tobacco 
industry viewed any meaningful 
promotion of children’s rights as a 
threat to its business and UNICEF 
as a potentially powerful opponent 
that needed to be monitored 
closely and neutralized.‍ UNICEF 
and organizations working closely 
with UNICEF should cease any 
partnerships with the tobacco 
industry or its front groups.‍
