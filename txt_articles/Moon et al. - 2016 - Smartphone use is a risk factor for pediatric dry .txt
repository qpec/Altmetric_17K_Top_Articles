dry eye disease according to region and
age: a case control study
Jun Hyung Moon, Kyoung Woo Kim and Nam Ju Moon*
Abstract
Background: In 2014, the overall rate of smartphone use in Korea was 83 and 89.8 % in children and adolescents.
The rate of smartphone use differs according to region (urban vs. rural) and age (younger grade vs. older grade).
We investigated risk and protective factors associated with pediatric dry eye disease (DED) in relation to
smartphone use rate according to region and age.
Methods: We enrolled 916 children and performed an ocular exam that included slit lamp exam and tear break-up
time. A questionnaire administered to children and their families consisted of video display terminal (VDT) use, outdoor
activity, learning, and modified ocular surface disease index (OSDI) score. DED was defined based on the International
Dry Eye Workshop guidelines (Objective signs: punctate epithelial erosion or short tear break-up time; subjective
symptoms: modified OSDI score) We performed statistical analysis of risk factors and protective factors in children
divided into groups as follows: DED vs. control, urban vs. rural, younger grade (1st to 3rd) vs. older grade (4th to 6th).
Results: A total of 6.6 % of children were included in the DED group, and 8.3 % of children in the urban group were
diagnosed with DED compared to 2.8 % in the rural group (P = 0.03). The rate of smartphone use was 61.3 % in the
urban group and 51.0 % in the rural group (P = 0.04). In total, 9.1 % of children in the older-grade group were
diagnosed with DED compared to 4 % in the younger-grade group (P = 0.03). The rate of smartphone use was 65.1 %
in older-grade children and 50.9 % in younger-grade children (P < 0.001). The mean daily duration of smartphone
use was longer in the DED group than controls (logistic regression analysis, P < 0.001, OR = 13.07), and the mean
daily duration of outdoor activities was shorter in the DED group than controls (logistic regression analysis, P < 0.
01, OR = 0.33). After cessation of smartphone use for 4 weeks in the DED group, both subjective symptoms and
objective signs had improved.
Conclusions: Smartphone use in children was strongly associated with pediatric DED; however, outdoor activity
appeared to be protective against pediatric DED. Older-grade students in urban environments had DED risk
factors (long duration of smartphone use), and a short duration of outdoor activity time. Therefore, close
observation and caution are needed when older children in urban areas use smartphones.

 Background
Dry eye disease (DED) can occur in association with a
number of congenital, autoimmune, endocrine, and in-
flammatory disorders, or under certain environmental
and nutritional conditions [1]. We initiated this study to
investigate environmental risk factors and protective fac-
tors for pediatric dry eye disease to correct risk factors
and encourage protective factors.
Korea has one of the world’s highest smartphone use
rates with an estimated 89.8 % rate of usage in 2014.
Pediatric dry eye disease tends to have a higher prevalence
in younger ages [1]. Therefore, it is imperative to investi-
gate risk factors and protective factors for pediatric DED
to prevent disease progression as much as possible.
Use of video display terminals and learning (reading
and writing) for long hours has been associated with a
decreased maximum blink interval, hence the develop-
ment of dry eye symptoms [2–4]. In addition, many
people report ocular fatigue after prolonged work with
video display terminals, in part prompting legislation
regulating the use of these terminals [5].
Pediatric DED is a public health concern and eco-
nomic challenge; thus, it is important to dedicate consid-
erable clinical attention to pediatric DED in Korea [6].
In our previous study, we investigated the association
between pediatric DED and video display terminal use [7].
DED is a multi-factorial disease, and there have not yet
been any in-depth studies considering risk factors and
protective factors for pediatric DED according to age and
region. In our study, we investigated risk factors and pro-
tective factors for pediatric dry eye disease associated with
smartphone use rate according to region and age.
Methods
Subjects
This study was a school-based cross sectional, case-
control study. We performed ophthalmologic examina-
tions on 630 children from eight primary schools in
Seoul, Korea (urban, male:female = 318:312) and in 286
children in Paju, Korea (rural, male:female = 168:118)
from May through October 2015. Seoul is the capital
city of South Korea and a large urban center with a
population of approximately 10 million. Paju is a city
with a population near 400,000. We performed ocular
exams on children in younger (1st to 3rd grade, aged 7
to 9) and older (4th to 6th grade, aged 10 to 12) grades
from elementary schools in these two regions.
This study was performed according to the Declaration
of Helsinki on Biomedical Research Involving Human
Subjects. The Institutional Review Board of Chung Ang
University of Medicine Review Board approved the clinical
study. Both parents and children themselves provided
written informed consent after being given a detailed ex-
planation of the study. We confirmed that parents had
seen the manuscript and patient data and agreed to its
publication in a journal.
The relative humidity in this region of Korea during
the time of the study (May to October) ranged from
57.8 to 58.2 % in urban areas (Seoul) and 58.1 to 58.4 %
in rural areas (Paju). There was no significant difference
in relative humidity between the two regions.
Exclusion criteria were: (1) children who underwent
any type of eye surgery in the past 6 months, (2) chil-
dren who had nocturnal lagophthalmos, (3) children
who had eyelid problems (trichiasis, districhiasis, or epi-
blepharon), (4) children who had allergic conjunctivitis
with the use of antihistamine drugs, (5) children who
wear contact lenses, and (6) children who had congeni-
tal, endocrinal, or autoimmune disease.
Ocular examinations
A single examiner performed all ocular exams. These
included visual acuity tests (best corrected VA with
trial lens, LogMAR), autokeratomery, slit-lamp exami-
nations of the cornea and conjunctiva, and evaluation
of eyelid problems, allergic conjunctivitis, and expos-
ure keratitis. Autokeratometry was measured using
Topcon Auto Kerato-Refractometer KR-8800 by a single
examiner; we reported the mean value of the three re-
peated measurements.
Tear break-up time (TBUT) was measured with a
fluorescein strip (Haag-Streit Inter- national, Koniz,
Switzerland) coated with one drop of balanced salt solu-
tion (BSS; Alcon Laboratories, Inc., Fort Worth, TX).
After applying the strip to the inferior conjunctival for-
nix, the participant resumed normal blinking for several
seconds. After the fluorescein solution spread across the
corneal surface, the participant was asked to keep his or
her eye open until the first defect of the tear film oc-
curred. TBUT was defined as the interval between
the last complete blink and the first appearance of a
dry spot on the pre-corneal surface of the tear film
[8]. The procedure was repeated three times for each
eye tested, with results reported as the mean value of
the three measurements.
A single examiner evaluated punctate epithelial erosions
(PEE) in the cornea and conjunctiva using a slit lamp ac-
cording to the Oxford Scheme Panel from 0 to 5 grades
[9]. The study protocol is included (Additional file 1).
Questionnaires
A self-administered questionnaire was given to the chil-
dren and their parents and both children and their parents
completed each questionnaire. Questionnaires were de-
signed to obtain information regarding risk factors for dry
eye disease, including the mean daily duration of video
display terminal (smartphone, computer, television) use,
learning (reading and writing), outdoor activities, and past

 history of allergic disease and antihistamine drug use. Sub-
jective ocular symptoms were measured with the modified
ocular surface disease index (OSDI) score. This index was
an objective parameter for DED diagnosis. Modified OSDI
scores range from 0 to 100 points, and higher scores
indicate greater discomfort due to dry eye disease. We
added the OSDI index and ophthalmologic questionnaire
(Additional file 1).
Diagnostic criteria of dry eye disease
Dry eye disease was diagnosed using a combination of
questionnaire data and clinical ophthalmologic testing
that elicited information on signs and symptoms based
on the 2007 Dry Eye Workshop (DEWS) guidelines [10].
Objective signs included (1) TBUT less than 10 s or
(2) positive corneal and conjunctival fluorescein staining.
A modified OSDI score greater than 20 points was used
for a positive measure of subjective symptoms. Children
who had one or more objective signs and more than 20
points on the modified OSDI score were analyzed in the
DED group.
Statistical analysis
We divided the school children into two groups and
made the following comparisons: DED vs. control, urban
vs. rural, younger graders vs. older graders. We used
multivariate logistic regression analysis to assess DED
risk and protective factors. Then, during 4 weeks of
smartphone cessation in the DED group, we compared
before and after parameters. Statistical analyses were
performed using SPSS for Windows (version 21; SPSS,
Inc., Chicago, IL). Continuous variables were compared
between groups using the Student’s t-test. The chi-square
test was used to compare non-continuous variables
between the two groups. P values less than 0.05 were
considered statistically significant.
Results
Comparative analysis between control and dry eye
disease group
The rate of DED in all children was 6.6 %. There were
significant differences based on region of residence,
mean age, visual acuity, and rate of eyeglass use between
the two groups. There was no statistically significant dif-
ference in terms of sex or spherical equivalent (diopter)
between the two groups (Table 1).
The rate of smartphone use was 55.4 % in the control
group and, 96.7 % in the DED group (P < 0.001). Smart-
phone use time per day was 0.62 ± 0.68 h in the control
group and 3.18 ± 0.97 h in the DED group (P < 0.001);
computer use time per day was 0.76 ± 0.34 h in the con-
trol group and 1.10 ± 0.53 h in the DED group (P < 0.001).
Learning time per day was 2.31 ± 1.02 h in the control
group and 3.10 ± 0.50 h in the DED group (P < 0.001).
Outdoor activity time per day was 2.27 ± 1.12 h in
the control group and 1.47 ± 0.32 h in the DED group
(P < 0.001).
Comparative analysis between urban and rural groups for
pediatric DED
We performed a comparative analysis of DED in 630
school children in urban environments and 286 children
in rural environments. Visual acuity (LogMAR) was
worse in the urban group, and the rate of eyeglass use
was higher in the urban group compared to the rural
group (Table 2).
The prevalence of DED was 8.3 % in the urban group
and 2.8 % in the rural group. This difference was statisti-
cally significant (P = 0.03). The rate of smartphone use
between the two regions also differed significantly,
with 61.3 % in urban areas and 51.0 % in rural areas
(P = 0.04). The mean daily duration of smartphone use
was 0.93 ± 1.01 h in the urban group and 0.47 ± 0.69 h in
the rural group (P < 0.001), while that of computer use
was 0.84 ± 0.29 h in the urban group and 0.68 ± 0.46 h in
the rural group (P < 0.001). The mean daily duration of
outdoor activity was 2.06 ± 1.13 h in the urban group
and 2.57 ± 0.95 h in the rural group (P < 0.001). The
average daily duration of learning was 2.50 ± 0.95 h in
the urban group and 2.05 ± 1.07 h in the rural group
(P < 0.001). Age, spherical equivalent, TV watching,
and sleeping time did not differ significantly between
the two groups (Table 2).

 Comparative analysis of pediatric DED between younger
(1st to 3rd) and older (4th to 6th) grade children
We performed comparative analysis of DED in 452 youn-
ger grade (1st to 3rd) children and 464 older grade (4th to
6th) children. The visual acuity (LogMAR) was worse in
older graders, and the rate of eyeglass use was higher in
older graders than in younger graders. The prevalence of
DED was 4 % in younger graders and 9.1 % in older
graders, which was a statistically significant difference
(P = 0.03). The rate of smartphone use was 50.9 % in
younger graders compared to 65.1 % in older graders. This
was also statistically significant (P < 0.001) (Table 3).
The mean daily duration of smartphone use was 0.57 ±
0.76 h in younger graders and 1.00 ± 1.06 h in older
graders (P < 0.001), and the mean daily duration of com-
puter use was 0.74 ± 0.37 h in younger graders and 0.83 ±
0.35 h in older graders (P < 0.01). These differences were
all statistically significant. The daily duration of learning
was 2.08 ± 0.95 h in younger graders and 2.63 ± 1.00 h in
older graders (P < 0.001). The daily duration of outdoor
activity was 2.49 ± 1.07 h in younger graders and 1.94 ±
1.07 h in older graders (P < 0.001). Region of residence,
mean daily TV watching and sleep duration did not show
significant differences between the two groups (Table 3).
Analysis of risk factors and protective factors for pediatric
DED
We performed logistic regression analysis to investigate
DED risk factors and protective factors. The mean daily
duration of smartphone use was 3.18 ± 0.97 h in the
DED group compared with 0.62 ± 0.68 h in the normal
group (OR = 13.07, P < 0.001) (Table 4).
The mean daily duration of outdoor activity was 1.47 ±
0.32 h in the DED group compared with 2.27 ± 1.12 h in
the normal group (OR = 0.33, P < 0.01). Mean daily
duration of computer use, TV watching, learning and
sleep did not relate to DED variably between the two
groups (Table 4).
Comparative analysis before and after cessation of
smartphone use over 4 weeks in the DED group
We performed comparative analysis before and after ces-
sation of smartphone use over 4 weeks in the DED
group. Punctate epithelial erosion improved after cessa-
tion of smartphone use from 93.3 to 0 % (P < 0.001).
Tear break-up time also improved after cessation from
10.00 ± 3.25 s to 11.33 ± 2.29 s (P < 0.001). OSDI score
was decreased after smartphone cessation from 30.74 ±
13.36 points to 14.53 ± 2.23 points (P < 0.001). Conse-
quently, the rate of DED decreased from 100 to 0 % after
smartphone cessation over 4 weeks (P < 0.001) (Table 5).
Discussion
In a previous study, the recent increase in smartphone use
caused an increase in reports of symptoms such as irrita-
tion, burning sensation, conjunctival injection, decreased
visual acuity, strain, and fatigue [11]. To the best of our
knowledge, there have been no previous comparative
studies of pediatric DED according to region and age. In
the Republic of Korea, the internet is well-developed and

 widely available, so it is common for children to use VDT
to view media and internet content. Additionally, the rate
of smartphone use has rapidly increased in Korean popu-
lations, especially among adolescents and school children.
A reduced blink rate during continuous smartphone
use causes faster evaporation of the tear film, which may
then lead to DED. In a previous study, we noted video
display terminal use and reading reduced the blink rate
to 5–6/min (1/3 of the resting state rate) and promoted
tear film evaporation and accommodation [12–15]. This
may lead to ocular fatigue and myopic shift. Here, we
pose the possibility that pediatric smartphone use and
reading induces a lower blink rate, which may contribute
to or cause pediatric DED. This comparative study of
pediatric DED associated with smartphone use evaluates
inter-region and inter-age variables. Logistic regression
analysis was performed to investigate the risk and pro-
tective factors associated with pediatric DED.
The rate of smartphone use was significantly higher in
the DED group than the control group. Continuous
smartphone use is thought to decrease the blink rate
and promote evaporation of the tear film, thus inducing
DED. There was a significant difference in the mean
duration of outdoor activity and learning between the
two groups; however, on logistic regression analysis, the
mean duration of smartphone use (OR = 13.07) was the
only strong risk factor for pediatric DED. The mean dur-
ation of computer use, TV watching and learning was
not significantly different on multivariate logistic regres-
sion analysis. In addition, increased outdoor activity time
reduced the rate of pediatric DED (OR = 0.33).
A greater proportion of students in the DED group
were urban versus rural residents. We suggest that that
the difference in smartphone use between regions led to
the difference in DED prevalence. The rate of eyeglass
use was higher in urban students and visual acuity
(LogMAR) was better in the rural group. The rate of
DED prevalence was higher in the urban group com-
pared to the rural group, and the mean daily duration
of smartphone use, computer use, and learning was
significantly longer in urban populations. Outdoor ac-
tivity time was longer in the rural group. The longer
duration of smartphone use, computer use and learn-
ing relative to low outdoor activity may have increased
the prevalence of DED and the rate of eyeglass use in
urban populations.
DED prevalence was also found to be higher in fe-
males than males. We surveyed our study population to
identify these differences in Korean children. In our
study, DED prevalence in children was higher in females;
however, there was no statistical significance. There was
no difference between the two groups with regard to
VDT use. In general, DED prevalence was higher in fe-
male adults compared to male adults.
The mean age was higher in the DED group than in
the normal group, and DED prevalence was higher in
older graders than younger graders. The rate of smart-
phone use was higher and the mean daily duration of
VDT was longer in older grades, which may have led to
the higher DED prevalence in older graders.
Smartphones are used with short watching distances
due to their small LED screens, thus inducing ocular fa-
tigue, glare, and irritation. VDT is associated with an

 increased incidence of DED and decreased visual acuity.
Gur [16] et al. reported that VDTs require reduced ac-
commodation and fusional convergence and induce a
−0.12 diopter myopic shift.
A limitation of our study is that only one school in
each region was surveyed. If we surveyed a greater num-
ber of schools in urban or rural areas, our data would be
more representative. Our study was aimed at school chil-
dren, so there may have been difference in self-reporting
and expression of ocular discomfort and comprehension
of the questionnaire between younger graders and older
graders, which could have affected our estimates of DED
prevalence. We did not consider a myriad of other factors,
including environmental and socioeconomic status. We
have shown an association and that in those who have dry
eyes we have shown that cessation of smartphone use im-
proves signs and symptoms; however, there are many
other variables that we have not assessed. In a smartphone
cessation study, it would be better to use controls who
had subjective complaints or higher OSDI scores and no
obvious disease on clinical exams to rule out accommoda-
tive fatigue or placebo effect.
We used subjective symptom criteria (modified OSDI
score) and objective signs (low TBUT or PEE) to diag-
nose DED. These criteria were based on adults and sub-
jective signs of DED were not obvious. Thus, the true
prevalence of DED in school children may be increased
or decreased due to the use of adult-targeted diagnostic
criteria. In our previous study, we confirmed that DED
coexists with allergic conjunctivitis [17]; however, be-
cause DED and ocular allergies have similar symptoms,
it was difficult to separate children with DED from those
with ocular allergies [18, 19]. Thus, the prevalence of
DED may have been affected by the prevalence of allergies
in our study population. We did not consider confounding
factors such as socioeconomic status, family composition,
dual income family status, or concurrent artificial tear use.
Conclusion
In conclusion, increased VDT use such as smartphones
or computers in Korean children was found to be associ-
ated with the occurrence of ocular surface symptoms.
Increased use of smartphones is a serious issue that may
result in ocular problems: the prevalence of DED was
6.6 %. The mean duration of VDT use per day, especially
smartphone use, was greater in the DED group than in
the normal group. Longer daily smartphone use may be
a risk factor for DED. The prevalence of DED was higher
in the urban group and in older children. Older-grade
children in the urban group used smartphones for longer
time periods than younger-grade children in rural areas.
DED prevalence was higher in older grade children from
urban groups compared to younger grade children in
rural groups. After cessation of smartphone use for
4 weeks in DED patients, both subjective symptoms and
objective signs improved.
Therefore, close observation and caution during VDT
use, especially smartphones, is recommended for older
children in urban areas. DED in children must be de-
tected early and should be treated with appropriate med-
ical and environmental interventions and education.
