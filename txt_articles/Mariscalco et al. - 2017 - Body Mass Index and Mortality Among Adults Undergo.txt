BACKGROUND: In an apparent paradox, morbidity and mortality are 
lower in obese patients undergoing cardiac surgery, although the nature 
of this association is unclear. We sought to determine whether the 
obesity paradox observed in cardiac surgery is attributable to reverse 
epidemiology, bias, or confounding.
METHODS: Data from the National Adult Cardiac Surgery registry for all 
cardiac surgical procedures performed between April 2002 and March 
2013 were extracted. A parallel systematic review and meta-analysis 
(MEDLINE, Embase, SCOPUS, Cochrane Library) through June 2015 were 
also accomplished. Exposure of interest was body mass index categorized 
into 6 groups according to the World Health Organization classification.
RESULTS: A total of 401 
227 adult patients in the cohort study and 
557 
720 patients in the systematic review were included. A U-shaped 
association between mortality and body mass index classes was observed 
in both studies, with lower mortality in overweight (adjusted odds ratio, 
0.79; 95% confidence interval, 0.76–0.83) and obese class I and II (odds 
ratio, 0.81; 95% confidence interval, 0.76–0.86; and odds ratio, 0.83; 
95% confidence interval, 0.74–0.94) patients relative to normal-weight 
patients and increased mortality in underweight individuals (odds ratio, 
1.51; 95% confidence interval, 1.41–1.62). In the cohort study, a U-shaped 
relationship was observed for stroke and low cardiac output syndrome but 
not for renal replacement therapy or deep sternal wound infection. Counter 
to the reverse epidemiology hypotheses, the protective effects of obesity 
were less in patients with severe chronic renal, lung, or cardiac disease 
and greater in older patients and in those with complications of obesity, 
including the metabolic syndrome and atherosclerosis. Adjustments for 
important confounders did not alter our results.
CONCLUSIONS: Obesity is associated with lower risks after cardiac 
surgery, with consistent effects noted in multiple analyses attempting to 
address residual confounding and reverse causation.

I
n an apparent paradox, obesity, an important risk 
factor for cardiovascular death,1,2 is associated with 
reduced mortality after cardiac surgery.3 Similar ob-
servations have been described in patients with acute 
coronary syndromes4 or heart failure5 and those requir-
ing dialysis.6 It is unclear whether this simply reflects 
the limitations of epidemiological analyses or whether 
there may be actual protective factors associated 
with obesity that contribute to improved outcomes. 
The obesity paradox has been attributed to reverse 
epidemiology (causation) or collider bias whereby the 
survival benefit associated with obesity actually re-
flects worse outcomes in underweight patients who 
also have frailty, cachexia, or severe chronic disease.7 
Alternative hypotheses are that obese patients are 
selected for surgery only if they are subjectively at 
lower risk and have high body mass index (BMI) but 
no metabolic syndrome with its related complications.8 
We report the results of 2 related studies in patients 
undergoing cardiac surgery: a cohort study of UK and 
Ireland cardiac surgery audit data and a systematic 
review with meta-analysis of this and other similar stud-
ies that have considered the relationship between BMI 
and mortality. The aim of these studies was to assess 
whether the obesity paradox in cardiac surgery can be 
attributed to reverse epidemiology, bias and confound-
ing, or other mechanisms.
METHODS
Observational Study Cohort
Prospectively collected data were extracted from the National 
Adult Cardiac Surgery Audit (NACSA) registry (version 4.1.2) of 
the National Institute for Cardiovascular Outcomes Research 
on December 1, 2014, for all cardiac operations performed 
in the United Kingdom and Ireland. These data are collected 
prospectively and undergo robust validation and checking 
procedures to maintain data quality.9–12 Duplicate records and 
nonadult cardiac surgery entries were removed; transcriptional 
discrepancies were harmonized; and clinical and temporal 
conflicts and extreme values were corrected or removed.11 
No attempt to replace missing values was made. The need to 
obtain informed consent was waived because patients’ identifi-
able information was either removed or pseudonymized. The 
study was approved by the National Institute for Cardiovascular 
Outcomes Research NACSA Research Board (study reference 
14-ACS-29) and complies with the Strengthening the Reporting 
of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting require-
ments for observational studies (Appendix I in the online-only 
Data Supplement).13
Study Design
We performed a retrospective, observational cohort study 
encompassing all adult cardiac surgical procedures per-
formed in the United Kingdom and Ireland between April 1, 
2002, and March 31, 2013. For each operation, data were 
recorded on patient characteristics and demographics, 
comorbidities, intraoperative factors, and postoperative out-
comes. Administrative data were also extracted. The analysis 
data set was obtained by including all cases with complete 
data on a set of key preoperative, intraoperative, and post-
operative variables as follows: age, BMI, sex, left ventricular 
ejection fraction category, history of myocardial infarction, 
renal impairment, diabetes mellitus on medication, previous 
cardiac surgery, operation type, and cardiopulmonary bypass 
use. Patients undergoing salvage surgical procedures (car-
diac arrest before induction), patients with critical preopera-
tive state (ventilated, cardiogenic shock, inotropic support, 
intra-aortic balloon pump), and patients with stage 5 chronic 
kidney disease (dialysis) were excluded. Patients for whom it 
was not possible to calculate the BMI or for whom the sex of 
the patient, operation type, or discharge status was missing 
were also excluded.
Study Outcomes, Exposures, and Confounding
BMI was defined as the weight in kilograms divided by the 
square of the height in meters.14 According to the World Health 
Organization (WHO) classification,15 BMI was further catego-
rized into 6 classes: underweight (BMI <18.5 kg/m2), normal 
weight (BMI 18.5–<25 kg/m2), overweight (BMI 25–<30 kg/
m2), obese class I (BMI 30–<35 kg/m2), obese class II (BMI 
35–<40 kg/m2), and obese class III (BMI ≥40 kg/m2). The pri-
mary end point was in-hospital mortality, defined as death in 
hospital after the index surgical procedure and before trans-
fer from the cardiac surgery unit as per the definition used 
in the national audit. Potential confounders prespecified in 
our analyses included severe chronic disease: chronic lung 
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• In a nationwide cohort study of 401 
227 adult 
patients and a systematic review of 557 
720 
patients from 13 countries, we demonstrated that 
overweight and obese patients had improved out-
comes after cardiac surgery compared with normal-
weight patients.
• Subgroup and sensitivity analyses designed to 
mitigate the effects of likely sources of bias and 
confounding did not affect our estimates that dem-
onstrated reductions in mortality with increasing lev-
els of obesity.
• Analysis of secondary outcomes indicated that obe-
sity also had divergent associations with important 
causes of death.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• The present findings do not support common prac-
tice whereby weight loss is recommended before 
surgery in the morbidly obese or very obese patients 
are refused surgery.
• These results suggest a new area for research into 
strategies that may minimize organ failure in cardiac 
surgery and other clinical settings characterized by 
acute surgical metabolic stress.

disease, chronic renal impairment, neurological dysfunction, 
and New York Heart Association class III/IV symptoms, as well 
as sex, increasing age, ejection fraction category, Canadian 
Cardiovascular Society class, diabetes mellitus, extracardiac 
arteriopathy, social deprivation index, and metabolic syndrome, 
a composite of increased BMI, hypertension, and diabetes mel-
litus. Secondary end points were low cardiac output, defined 
by the new use of an intra-aortic balloon pump postoperatively; 
re-exploration for bleeding/tamponade; postoperative stroke; 
severe acute kidney injury, defined as need for new postopera-
tive renal replacement therapy (RRT); and occurrence of deep 
sternal wound infection. Variables and outcomes were defined 
according to the NACSA registry.10
Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
The review protocol was developed, and complete details, 
including electronic search strategy, objectives, criteria for 
study selection, eligibility, data collection, and assessment of 
study quality, were published online and registered in PROSPERO 
(CRD42015024232).16 The review adhered to MOOSE (Meta-
Analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology) and PRISMA 
(Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-
Analyses) guidelines (Appendixes II and III in the online-only 
Data Supplement).17,18
Briefly, literature searches were systematically performed 
with electronic databases (MEDLINE [PubMed and Ovid], 
Embase, SCOPUS, and Cochrane Library) without date or 
language restriction from inception to the end of June 2015. 
Key words and MeSH terms pertinent to the exposure of inter-
est were used in relevant combinations: body mass index, 
obesity, overweight, underweight, cardiac surgery, adult, 
coronary artery bypass grafting, valve surgery, aortic surgery, 
cardiac transplant, ventricular assist device, mortality, mor-
bidity, and patient outcome. References of all eligible stud-
ies and review articles were also screened to identify relevant 
resources that were not previously identified. The exposure of 
interest was obesity stratified into the 6 BMI groups accord-
ing to the WHO classification.15 Studies with alternative BMI 
definitions of the underweight class were also included and 
defined as modified WHO classification. All adult cardiac surgi-
cal procedures were considered. Studies in which BMI was 
expressed as a continuous variable or in which BMI classes 
were merged were excluded. The primary outcome of inter-
est was all-cause mortality in hospital or within 30 days from 
the index admission or procedure. Inclusion and exclusion 
criteria for qualitative/quantitative analyses were summarized 
according to the PICOS (population, intervention, comparator, 
outcomes, and study design) approach (Table I in the online-
only Data Supplement). Year of publication, study design, 
country, sample size, recruitment period, number of patients 
in each treatment group, inclusion and exclusion criteria, 
measured outcomes, obesity classification, baseline patient 
demographics, cardiac status, comorbidities, and outcomes 
among relevant subgroups of patients were extracted. The 
Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for cohort and case-control studies 
was used to assess study quality.19
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis methods are fully reported in the online-only 
Data Supplement. Briefly, baseline characteristics, operative 
factors, and univariate outcomes were described as median 
(25th–75th percentiles) and counts and percents and com-
pared among BMI groups with the Kruskal-Wallis test and the 
χ2 test, respectively. To adjust the effect of BMI (6 categories) 
for potential confounders, multivariable logistic regression 
models of the primary and secondary outcomes were fitted. 
Sensitivity analyses evaluated the effects of inclusion or exclu-
sion of suggested confounders identified in previous analyses 
of the obesity paradox.3,20–44 Subgroup analyses assessed the 
interaction in the full model between prespecified known risk 
factors for adverse outcomes in cardiac surgery and the asso-
ciations between BMI and mortality. Propensity score analysis 
(propensity for being overweight) was also performed. Effect 
estimates were presented as odds ratios (ORs) and 95% con-
fidence intervals (CIs). Stata version 13.1 (StataCorp, College 
Station, TX) was used for computation. The meta-analysis was 
performed with R version 3.2.2 (R Core Team, 2015) with the 
metafor package version 1.9-8.45,46 Random/mixed-effects 
models were adopted to summarize the results expressed 
as relative risks (95% CIs).47,48 The contribution of study-level 
covariates to heterogeneity was assessed with mixed-effects 
models. Publication bias was assessed with funnel plots and 
the Egger test.49 Statistical tests were 2 sided with a signifi-
cance threshold of P<0.05.
RESULTS
Observational Study Cohort
Of the 401 
227 records identified in the NACSA regis-
try, 350 
800 (87.4%) had complete case data and were 
included in the analysis data set. The final cohort pre-
sented a median age of 59 years (25th–75th percentile, 
18–67 years), and 27% were women. Median BMI was 
27.5 kg/m2 (25th–75th percentile, 24.8–30.7 kg/m2), 
and 3382 patients (1%) were classified as underweight, 
91 
378 (26%) as normal weight, 150 
769 (43%) as over-
weight, 77 
614 (22%) as obese class I, 21 
610 (6%) as 
obese class II, and 6047 (2%) as obese class III. Preop-
erative and operative characteristics are summarized in 
the Table.50,51 Patients with higher BMI were younger and 
had a higher prevalence of hypertension and diabetes 
mellitus. A higher prevalence of women was observed 
in the underweight and the morbidly obese groups. Key 
variable comparison of the cohort with incomplete data 
to the complete case cohort suggested that the miss-
ing-at-random mechanism was applicable (Table II in the 
online-only Data Supplement).
Primary End Point
Overall, 11 
511 patients died in hospital (3.29%; 95% CI, 
3.23–3.34). Mortality was 8.5% in underweight patients, 
4.4% in normal-weight patients, 2.7% in overweight pa-
tients, 2.8% in obese class I to II patients, and 3.7% in 
obese class III patients (Table III in the online-only Data 
Supplement). This U-shaped relationship was confirmed 
after adjustment for baseline differences (Figure 1A).

Multiple additional baseline predictors of mortality dif-
fered in frequency across the BMI groups (Table IV in 
the online-only Data Supplement). After adjustment for 
differences in baseline risk, the OR for hospital mortality 
was 1.51 (95% CI, 1.41–1.62) for underweight versus 
normal-weight patients (Tables III and IV in the online-
only Data Supplement). Compared with normal-weight 
patients, the adjusted ORs for hospital mortality were 
0.79 (95% CI, 0.76–0.83) for overweight, 0.81 (95% CI, 
0.76–0.86) for obese class I, 0.83 (95% CI, 0.74–0.94) 
for obese class II, and 0.99 (95% CI, 0.80–1.22) for 
obese class III patients.
Sensitivity and Subgroup Analyses
Fractional polynomial, restricted cubic spline, and pro-
pensity score analyses demonstrated findings similar to 
our primary analysis (Tables IV and V and Figure I in the 
online-only Data Supplement). Sensitivity analyses that 
excluded patients with low BMI (underweight patients), 
poor exercise tolerance (New York Heart Association 
class III/IV), and severe chronic cardiac, neurological, re-
nal, or respiratory diseases also did not materially alter 
our findings (Figure 1B). Analyses of subgroup interac-
tions indicated that the relative reductions in mortality

viduals were less in patients with atrial fibrillation, chron-
ic lung disease, kidney disease, or poor left ventricular 
function (Figure 1C–1E and Table VI and Figure II in the 
online-only Data Supplement). In contrast, the protective 
associations seen with obesity were greater in older 
patients and in those with coronary disease undergoing 
coronary artery bypass grafting, extracardiac arteriopa-
thy, or the metabolic syndrome (Figure 1F–1H and Table 
VI and Figure II in the online-only Data Supplement). The 
interaction between smoking status, BMI, and mortality 
was statistically significant but demonstrated mixed in-
creases and decreases in odds of death by BMI class 
for each smoking category; never smoker, ex-smoker, 
and current smoker. Nonetheless, each category dem-
onstrated a U-shaped relationship between BMI and 
mortality as per the primary analyses. The differences in 
mortality between obesity classes were also consistent 
over time (Table VI in the online-only Data Supplement).
Secondary End Points
To explore processes that could underlie the results of 
our primary analysis, we also evaluated the associations 
between BMI and important causes of death. Low cardiac 
output was observed in 3155 patients (1.0%), re-explo-
ration for bleeding/tamponade in 14 
509 (4.6%), stroke 
in 3120 (1.0%), RRT in 10 
814 (3.6%), and deep sternal 
wound infection in 681 (0.2%; Table III in the online-only 
Data Supplement). Similar to the primary end point of 
hospital mortality, a U-shaped relationship was demon-
strated between increasing BMI class and postoperative 
RRT and stroke (Figure 2). An inverse U shape was ob-
served for low cardiac output (postoperative intra-aortic 
balloon pump). In contrast, the rate of re-exploration for 
bleeding/tamponade decreased stepwise with increas-
ing BMI, whereas the rate of deep sternal wound infec-
tion increased with BMI class. These relationships were 
not altered after adjustment for baseline differences. Ad-
ditional analyses are reported in the Results section in 
the online-only Data Supplement.
Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
Of the 4788 records identified by our searches, 26 eli-
gible cohort observational studies were identified and 
included in the meta-analysis (Figure III in the online-only 
Data Supplement).8,26–50 When the data from the NACSA 
registry were included, the final meta-analysis popula-
tion comprised 557 
720 patients. Regions of origin of 
participants included Europe (n=14), the United States 
(n=9), and Asia (n=3), and patients from 13 countries 
were included (Table VII in the online-only Data Supple-
ment). Study characteristics and collected outcomes for 
each BMI group are summarized in Tables VIII through 
X in the online-only Data Supplement. Five comparisons 
among BMI groups were considered: normal-weight ver-
sus overweight patients (27 studies), normal-weight ver-
sus obese class I patients (17 studies), normal-weight 
versus obese class II patients (4 studies), normal-weight 
versus obese class III patients (5 studies), and finally 
normal-weight versus underweight patients (19 studies; 
Table XI in the online-only Data Supplement). Normal-
weight patients were classified according to either the 
standard (BMI 18.5–<25 kg/m2) or the modified WHO 
classification (BMI, 20–<25 kg/m2) introduced by Gurm 
and colleagues.26 Other studies considering other clas-
sifications of the underweight class (18 or 19 kg/m2) 
were considered and pooled within the standard or the 
modified WHO classifications (full Methods section in the 
online-only Data Supplement).31,36,37 Newcastle Ottawa 
Scale assessment of study quality is reported in Table 
XII in the online-only Data Supplement.
As per our cohort study, we demonstrated the 
obesity paradox in our meta-analysis. Compared with 
normal-weight patients, the observed relative risks 
were 0.73 (95% CI, 0.66–0.81) for overweight, 0.76 
(95% CI, 0.67–0.86) for obese class I, 0.65 (95% 
CI, 0.60–0.71) for obese class II, and 0.83 (95% CI, 
0.74–0.94) for obese class III patients (Figures 3 and 
4). Underweight patients had significantly increased 
mortality (relative risk, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.30–2.42) com-
pared with normal-weight individuals (Figure 3). Sen-
sitivity analyses showed that the survival benefit for 
overweight/obese patients was greater when studies 
with significant methodological limitations (Newcastle-
Ottawa Scale score <8) or studies that used modified 
WHO definitions of obesity were excluded (Table XIII 
in the online-only Data Supplement). Subgroup analy-
sis demonstrated that the reductions in mortality with 
increasing obesity were greatest in patients undergo-
ing isolated coronary artery bypass grafting compared 
with other types of surgical procedure (Figures 3 and 
4). Funnel plots revealed no evidence of publication 
bias in any of the mortality comparisons (Figure IV 
in the online-only Data Supplement). Between-study 
heterogeneity was statistically significant in the anal-
yses of normal-weight versus overweight patients

DISCUSSION
In large cohorts of UK and Irish patients undergoing 
cardiac surgery, we found that overweight and obese 
patients had lower in-hospital mortality compared with 
normal-BMI patients, whereas underweight patients had 
increased mortality. This relationship was unchanged 
when patients with low BMI, severe chronic disease, or 
severe limitation of exercise tolerance were excluded. 
Reductions in mortality associated with increasing BMI 
class were greater in older patients and in those with 
clinical complications of obesity. The relationship be-
tween obesity and secondary outcomes demonstrated 
heterogeneity; obesity was associated with a reduc-
tion of primarily ischemic complications such as low 
cardiac output and stroke but not RRT or infections. 
In a systematic review of 27 studies that included pa-
tients from 13 countries, we observed similar results. 
Subgroup and meta-regression analyses also demon-
strated greater reductions in mortality associated with 
obesity in the elderly and in patients with coronary ar-
tery disease.
Our cohort study was significantly larger than all previ-
ous evaluations of the obesity paradox in cardiac surgery 
combined. We used high-quality, prospectively collected 
data that are used as part of a national quality control 
program in UK and Irish cardiac surgery. The study co-
hort included all patients undergoing cardiac surgery in 
every UK and Irish unit. Our analysis population included 
87.4% of all patients, and we demonstrated that data 
missingness was likely to be random, reducing the likeli-
hood of sampling bias. The study limitations were those 
of any retrospective analysis, notably the likelihood that 
unmeasured confounders will have introduced unknown 
bias. For example, it is possible that obese patients with 
a more severe profile of comorbidities and considered at 
high risk for a cardiac operation were excluded from sur-
gery. The sample size of the cohort will have mitigated 
this source of bias because there were large numbers of 
patients with significant comorbidity in each BMI group, 
thereby allowing accurate estimation of the interaction 
between obesity and known risk factors for adverse out-
come. The use of BMI as a marker of obesity also has 
significant limitations, and other important aspects of 
body composition such as visceral fat or fat distribution 
were not explored.
Our systematic review had important strengths. We 
used a comprehensive search strategy and contempo-
rary assessments of study quality. We found that 17 
of 27 studies had significant limitations. Studies of low 
quality and those that used nonstandard definitions of 
obesity were more likely to conclude that there was no 
obesity paradox. We also used detailed statistical meth-
ods to explore the independent contribution of potential 
confounders. This demonstrated that risk factors con-
tributing to heterogeneity in the analysis of underweight 
patients (chronic lung disease and history of myocardial 
infarction) differed from those contributing to heteroge-
neity in the analyses of the obese (age and coronary 
artery disease). The meta-analysis also had limitations. 
Principally, the analysis relied on the reported informa-
tion on confounding variables that were controlled for; 
consistent analyses of all studies can be done only when 
data on individual patients are combined. A limitation is 
that our studies consider data with a different time inter-
val (March 2013 versus December 2015). The NACSA 
registry allowed us to collect and analyze validated data 
through March 2013 only.10,11 Another limitation of both 
analyses is that they considered only short-term mortal-
ity. Given that obesity is a principal etiologic factor in 
cardiovascular disease and premature death,1,52,53 it is 
possible that early reductions in mortality observed in 
obese patients may not be sustained in the midterm to 
long-term. This has been reported in a previous study in 
which the short-term reduction in mortality observed in 
overweight and obese patients was no longer evident 
at 5 years.54 Acute weight loss is also known to reduce 
major adverse cardiovascular event rates in patients 
with coronary artery disease in the longer term.55,56 A 
final limitation is that observational analyses, includ-
ing in the present study, cannot prove or disprove the 
reverse epidemiology hypothesis for the obesity para-
dox; greater survival benefit attributable to increasing 
weight may equally represent increased mortality with 
lower body mass. It is intuitive that cachexia in cardiac 
patients, commonly associated with chronic diseases 
affecting the heart, lung, and kidneys, will contribute to 
adverse outcomes.57 Alternatively, patients with severe

symptomatic coronary artery disease in the absence of 
obesity may represent a more aggressive phenotype 
and consequently have a worse outcome. However, 
both subgroup and sensitivity analyses suggested that 
patients with low BMI (<18.5 kg/m2) or severe chronic 
lung, cardiac, neurological, or renal disease did not ex-
plain our findings. In fact, the effect of increasing obe-
sity, or inversely lower body mass, on mortality was 
significantly less in these groups. This is in complete 
contrast to the interactions observed for increasing 
age, metabolic syndrome, and atherosclerotic disease. 
We also observed heterogeneity in the relationships be-
tween BMI and the principal causes of in-hospital death 
in cardiac surgery. These are key findings. If the rela-
tionship between obesity and mortality were simply the 
result of reverse epidemiology or confounding, then it 
would be expected that there would be a consistent ef-
fect on the estimate of the association between BMI and 
mortality across all risk factors for adverse outcome or 
important causes of death. A common example of this 
phenomenon is red cell transfusion, which is strongly 
associated with mortality and all important causes of 
mortality in cardiac surgery in cohort studies but has 
different and divergent effects on these events in ran-
domized trials that consider causation.58,59
These findings highlight knowledge gaps that must 
be addressed by further research. They identify a high-
risk cohort, patients with low BMI, who could poten-
tially benefit from targeted weight gain interventions 
before surgery. They also challenge current practice 
whereby obese patients are rejected for or advised to 
lose weight before major surgery. The present analyses 
included large cohorts of obese class III (BMI ≥40 kg/
m2) patients who are considered to have significantly 
higher morbidity and mortality and to use significantly 
more resources than other patient groups.60 However, 
neither the National Institute for Cardiovascular Out-
comes Research analysis nor the systematic review 
demonstrated an increase in mortality in these patients 
relative to normal-weight individuals. Divergent associa-
tions between obesity and important causes of death 
were most marked in this group; obese class III pa-
tients had less perioperative cardiac failure or bleed-
ing but higher rates of deep sternal wound infection 
and RRT. The overall effects on resource use remain 
unclear because the National Institute for Cardiovascu-
lar Outcomes Research does not capture resource use 
data. Further research should consider whether strate-
gies focused on the prevention of wound infection or 
acute kidney injury will have specific benefits in these 
morbidly obese patients.
CONCLUSIONS
We explored the basis of the obesity paradox in 2 related 
studies in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Mitiga-
tion of the effects of potential bias and confounding did 
not substantially affect our estimates that demonstrated 
reductions in mortality with increasing levels of obesity. 
Moreover, analysis of subgroup interactions and second-
ary outcomes did not support a reverse epidemiology 
hypothesis. These findings highlight a knowledge gap 
with respect to the perioperative management of body 
mass and obesity in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.
