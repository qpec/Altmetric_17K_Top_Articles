Malignant mesothelioma is a neoplasm associated with 
occupational and environmental inhalation exposure to 
asbestos* fibers and other elongate mineral particles (EMPs) 
(1–3). Patients have a median survival of approximately 
1 year from the time of diagnosis (1). The latency period 
from first causative exposure to malignant mesothelioma 
development typically ranges from 20 to 40 years but can be 
as long as 71 years (2,3). Hazardous occupational exposures 
to asbestos fibers and other EMPs have occurred in a vari-
ety of industrial operations, including mining and milling, 
manufacturing, shipbuilding and repair, and construction 
(3). Current exposures to commercial asbestos in the United 
States occur predominantly during maintenance operations 
and remediation of older buildings containing asbestos (3,4). 
To update information on malignant mesothelioma mortality 
(5), CDC analyzed annual multiple cause-of-death records† 
for 1999–2015, the most recent years for which complete 
data are available. During 1999–2015, a total of 45,221 
deaths with malignant mesothelioma mentioned on the death 
certificate as the underlying or contributing cause of death 
were reported in the United States, increasing from 2,479 
deaths in 1999 to 2,597 in 2015 (in the same time period the 
age-adjusted death rates§ decreased from 13.96 per million 
in 1999 to 10.93 in 2015). Malignant mesothelioma deaths 
increased for persons aged ≥85 years, both sexes, persons of 
white, black, and Asian or Pacific Islander race, and all ethnic 
groups. Despite regulatory actions and the decline in use 
of asbestos the annual number of malignant mesothelioma 
deaths remains substantial. The continuing occurrence of 
malignant mesothelioma deaths underscores the need for 
maintaining measures to prevent exposure to asbestos fibers 
and other causative EMPs and for ongoing surveillance to 
monitor temporal trends.
For this report, malignant mesothelioma deaths dur-
ing 1999–2015 were identified from death certificates and 
included deaths for which International Classification of Diseases 
(ICD), 10th Revision codes for malignant mesothelioma¶ were 
listed as either the underlying or contributing cause of death 
in the multiple cause-of-death mortality data. The analysis was 
restricted to deaths of persons aged ≥25 years, as they were more 
likely to have been occupationally exposed than were younger 
decedents. Age-adjusted death rates per 1 million persons aged 
≥25 years by demographics, neoplasm anatomical site, and 
year were calculated using the 2000 U.S. Census standard 
population estimate. Industry and occupation information was 
available from death certificates for decedents reported from 23 
states for 1999, 2003, 2004, and 2007, and was coded** using 
the U.S. Census 2000 Industry and Occupation Classification 
System. Proportionate mortality ratios (PMRs)†† for malignant 
mesothelioma by industry and occupation were calculated. 
Confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated assuming Poisson 
distribution of the data.
During 1999–2015, a total of 45,221 deaths with malig-
nant mesothelioma mentioned on the death certificate as the 
underlying or contributing cause of death among persons aged 
≥25 years were reported in the United States; 16,914 (37.4%) 
occurred among persons aged 75–84 years, 36,093 (79.8%) 
occurred among males, 42,778 (94.6%) among whites, and 
43,316 (95.8%) among non-Hispanics (Table 1). Malignant 
mesothelioma was classified as mesothelioma of pleura (3,351; 
7.4%), peritoneum (1,854; 4.1%), pericardium (74; 0.2%), 
other anatomic site (5,280; 11.7%), and unspecified anatomic 
site (35,068; 77.5%). Among 42,470 (93.9%) decedents, 
malignant mesothelioma was coded as the underlying§§ cause 
of death.

During 1999–2015, the annual number of malignant meso-
thelioma deaths increased 4.8% overall, from 2,479 in 1999 
to 2,579 in 2015 (p-value for linear time trend <0.001). The 
number of malignant mesothelioma deaths increased among 
persons aged ≥85 years, both sexes, white, black, and Asian or 
Pacific Islander race, and all ethnic groups; and patients with 
mesothelioma of the peritoneum and unspecified anatomic 
site. Malignant mesothelioma deaths decreased among persons 
aged 35–44, 45–54, and 55–64 years, and among persons with 
mesothelioma of the pleura and other anatomic sites.
During 1999–2015, the mesothelioma age-adjusted death rate 
decreased 21.7% from 13.96 per million population (1999) to 
10.93 (2015) (p-value for time trend <0.001). This trend in the 
standardized rate is a weighted average of the trends in the age-
specific rates and masks the differences in individual age groups. 
The age-specific death rate decreased significantly among per-
sons 45–54 (p<0.001), 55–64 (p<0.001), and 65–74 (p<0.001) 
years and increased significantly among persons aged ≥85 years 
(p<0.001). During 1999–2015, the annualized state mesothe-
lioma age-adjusted death rate exceeded 20 per million per year 
in two states: Maine (22.06) and Washington (20.10) (Figure).

Industry and occupation data were available for 1,830 
(96.3%) of 1,900 malignant mesothelioma deaths that 
occurred in residents of 23 states during 1999, 2003, 2004, 
and 2007 (Table 2).¶¶ Among 207 industries and 274 occu-
pations, significantly elevated PMRs for malignant mesothe-
lioma were found for 11 industries and 17 occupations. By 
industry, the highest PMRs were for ship and boat building 
and repairing (6.7; 95% CI = 4.3–9.9); petroleum refining 
(4.1; CI = 2.6–6.0); and industrial and miscellaneous chemicals 
(3.8; CI = 2.9–5.0). By occupation, the highest PMRs were for 
insulation workers (26.9; CI = 16.2–42.0); chemical techni-
cians (4.9; CI = 2.1–9.6); and pipelayers, plumbers, pipefitters, 
and steamfitters (4.8; CI = 3.7–6.1).
Discussion
The annual number of malignant mesothelioma deaths 
is increasing, particularly among persons aged ≥85 years, 
most likely representing exposure many years ago. However, 
although malignant mesothelioma deaths decreased in persons 
aged 35–64 years, the continuing occurrence of mesothe-
lioma deaths among persons aged <55 years suggests ongoing 
occupational and environmental exposures to asbestos fibers 
and other causative EMPs, despite regulatory actions by the 
Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)*** 
and the Environmental Protection Agency††† aimed at limiting 
asbestos exposure. OSHA established a permissible exposure 
limit for asbestos of 12 fibers per cubic centimeter (f/cc) of 
air as an 8-hour time-weighted average in 1971. This initial 
permissible exposure limit was reduced to 5 f/cc in 1972, 2 f/cc 
in 1976, 0.2 f/cc in 1986, and 0.1 f/cc in 1994 (6). Although

many aspects of this standard were set aside by the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court 
of Appeals. The following specific asbestos-containing products remain 
banned: flooring felt, rollboard, and corrugated, commercial, or specialty 
paper (58 Federal Register 58964). In addition, the regulation continues to 
ban the use of asbestos in products that have not historically contained 
asbestos, otherwise referred to as “new uses” of asbestos. Asbestos-containing 
product categories no longer subject to the 1989 ban include asbestos-cement

US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
inspection data during 1979–2003 indicated a general decline 
in the proportion of samples exceeding designated occupational 
exposure limits, 20% of air samples collected in the construc-
tion industry in 2003 for compliance purposes exceeded the 
OSHA permissible exposure limit. Moreover, asbestos products 
remain in use, and new asbestos-containing products continue 
to be manufactured in or imported§§§ into the United States. 
Although most deaths from malignant mesothelioma in the 
United States are the result of exposures to asbestos 20–40 years 
prior, new cases might result from occupational exposure to 
asbestos fibers during maintenance activities, demolition and 
remediation of existing asbestos in structures, installations, 
and buildings if controls are insufficient to protect workers. 
The OSHA asbestos standard describes engineering and work 
practice controls (e.g., use of wet methods, local exhaust ven-
tilation, and vacuum cleaners equipped with high-efficiency 
particulate air [HEPA] filters) during asbestos handling, mix-
ing, removal, cutting, application, and cleanup and requires the 
use of respiratory protection if these controls are not sufficient 
to reduce employee exposure to levels at or below the permis-
sible limit. Moreover, family members of workers engaged in 
activities placing them at risk for asbestos exposures also have 
the potential for exposure to asbestos (3). In addition, ongoing 
research is focusing on the potential nonoccupational and envi-
ronmental exposures to asbestos fibers and other EMPs (e.g., 
erionite, a naturally occurring fibrous mineral that belongs to 
a group of minerals called zeolites), and nonmineral elongate 
particles (e.g., carbon nanotubes) to assess exposures and 
potential health risks (7,8).
Among the 96.3% of deaths in 23 states for which industry 
and occupation were known, shipbuilding and construction 
industries were major contributors to malignant mesothelioma 
mortality (4). The large number of deaths among construc-
tion workers is consistent with large number of construction 
workers with prior direct and indirect exposure to asbestos 
fibers through most of the 20th century (the construction 
industry accounted for 70%–80% of asbestos consumption) 
(4). For example, direct exposure to asbestos has occurred 
during installation of asbestos-cement pipes, asbestos-cement 
sheets, architectural panels, built-up roofing, and removal of 
roofing felts or asbestos insulation. Workers also might have 
been exposed to asbestos during spraying of asbestos insula-
tion in multistoried structures during 1958–1972 (asbestos-
containing materials were banned for fireproofing/insulating 
in 1973) (4). In addition, workers in other occupations (e.g., 
carpenters, electricians, pipefitters, plumbers, welders) might 
also have been exposed if they were present on-site during 
spraying activities.
A review of studies projecting the number of deaths from 
asbestos-related malignant mesothelioma in the United States 
indicated that the number of deaths during 1985–2009 would 
range from 620 to 3,270 annually (9). Based on an estimated 
27.5 million workers with some exposure to asbestos dur-
ing 1940–1972, a 1982 study estimated that the number of 
malignant mesothelioma deaths would rise to 3,060 annu-
ally by 2001–2005 (4). After 2005, mortality was projected 
to decrease but would continue for three decades. Based on 
asbestos consumption and malignant mesothelioma incidence 
data, it was estimated that the number of mesothelioma cases 
among males would peak during 2000–2004 (approximately 
2,000 cases) and after that period, the number of mesothelioma 
cases was expected to decline and return to background levels 
by 2055 (10). The number of mesothelioma cases among 
females (approximately 560 in 2003) was projected to increase 
slightly over time. The results of the current study indicate 
an increase in the number of malignant mesothelioma deaths 
during 1999–2015. This discrepancy might be explained, in 
part, by the methodology of the projection studies, which 
were based on multiple assumptions including variations in 
the number of employed workers at risk, exposure levels and 
timing, and the linear dose–response relationship between 
asbestos exposure¶¶¶ and malignant mesothelioma. Moreover, 
additional persons who might have been exposed to asbestos 
and be at risk for malignant mesothelioma (e.g., family con-
tacts of asbestos-exposed workers, persons exposed to naturally 
occurring asbestos, persons exposed to asbestos in surfacing 
materials or as fireproofing material in buildings) were not 
considered (4,10).
The findings in this report are subject to at least five limita-
tions. First, information on exposure to asbestos or a specific 
work history was not available to assess the potential source 
of exposure. The industry and occupation listed on a death 
certificate might not be the industry and occupation in which 
the decedent’s exposures occurred. Second, the state issuing a 
death certificate might not be the state or country in which the 
 §§§ In the United States, approximately 340 metric tons of asbestos were imported 
in 2016; nearly all asbestos was used by the chloralkali industry to 
manufacture semipermeable diaphragms. An unknown quantity of asbestos 
was imported within manufactured products, including brake linings and 
pads, building materials, gaskets, millboard, and yarn and thread, among 
others (Flanagan DM. U.S. Geological Survey, 2017, Mineral Commodity 
Summaries. Asbestos. https://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/mcs/2017/
mcs2017.pdf).
 ¶¶¶ Malignant mesothelioma can develop after short-term asbestos exposures of 
only a few weeks, and from very low levels of exposure. There is no evidence 
of a threshold level below which there is no risk for mesothelioma. The risk 
for mesothelioma increases with intensity and duration of asbestos exposure.

decedent’s exposures occurred. Third, malignant mesothelioma 
did not have a discrete ICD code until the 10th revision of 
the ICD; thus, evaluation of mortality trends before 1999 was 
not possible. Fourth, some mesothelioma cases might not be 
included in this analysis because of misdiagnosis and the use of 
incorrect ICD-10 codes (1). Finally, information on decedents’ 
industry and occupation was available only for selected states of 
residence and years, and might not be nationally representative.
Despite regulatory actions and the decline in use of asbestos, 
the annual number of malignant mesothelioma deaths remains 
substantial. Effective asbestos exposure prevention strategies 
for employers recommended by OSHA and CDC’s National 
Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (https://www.
cdc.gov/niosh/topics/asbestos/) are available. The continuing 
occurrence of malignant mesothelioma deaths underscores the 
need for maintaining asbestos exposure prevention efforts and 
for ongoing surveillance to monitor temporal trends.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Malignant mesothelioma is a neoplasm associated with 
inhalation exposure to asbestos fibers and other elongate 
mineral particles (EMPs). The median survival after malignant 
mesothelioma diagnosis is approximately 1 year. The latency 
period between the first exposure to asbestos fibers or other 
EMPs and mesothelioma development ranges from 20 to 
71 years. Occupational exposure has occurred in industrial 
operations including mining and milling, manufacturing, 
shipbuilding and repair, and construction. Current occupational 
exposure occurs predominantly during maintenance and 
remediation of asbestos-containing buildings. The projected 
number of malignant mesothelioma deaths was expected to 
increase to 3,060 annually by 2001–2005, and after 2005, 
mortality was projected to decrease.
What is added by this report?
During 1999–2015, a total of 45,221 malignant mesothelioma 
deaths were reported, increasing from 2,479 (1999) to 2,597 
(2015). Mesothelioma deaths increased for persons aged 
≥85 years, for both sexes, persons of white, black and Asian or 
Pacific Islander race, and all ethnic groups. Continuing occur-
rence of malignant mesothelioma deaths in persons aged 
<55 years suggests ongoing inhalation exposure to asbestos 
fibers and possibly other causative EMPs.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Despite regulatory actions and decline in asbestos use, the 
annual number of malignant mesothelioma deaths remains 
substantial. Contrary to past projections, the number of 
malignant mesothelioma deaths has been increasing. The 
continuing occurrence of mesothelioma deaths, particularly 
among younger populations, underscores the need for 
maintaining efforts to prevent exposure and for ongoing 
surveillance to monitor temporal trends.
