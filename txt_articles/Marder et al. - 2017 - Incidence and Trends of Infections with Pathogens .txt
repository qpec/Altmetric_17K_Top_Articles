Foodborne diseases represent a substantial public health con-
cern in the United States. CDC’s Foodborne Diseases Active 
Surveillance Network (FoodNet) monitors cases reported from 
10 U.S. sites* of laboratory-diagnosed infections caused by 
nine enteric pathogens commonly transmitted through food. 
This report describes preliminary surveillance data for 2016 
on the nine pathogens and changes in incidences compared 
with 2013–2015. In 2016, FoodNet identified 24,029 infec-
tions, 5,512 hospitalizations, and 98 deaths caused by these 
pathogens. The use of culture-independent diagnostic tests 
(CIDTs) by clinical laboratories to detect enteric pathogens has 
been steadily increasing since FoodNet began surveying clinical 
laboratories in 2010 (1). CIDTs complicate the interpretation 
of FoodNet surveillance data because pathogen detection could 
be affected by changes in health care provider behaviors or 
laboratory testing practices (2). Health care providers might be 
more likely to order CIDTs because these tests are quicker and 
easier to use than traditional culture methods, a circumstance 
that could increase pathogen detection (3). Similarly, patho-
gen detection could also be increasing as clinical laboratories 
adopt DNA-based syndromic panels, which include pathogens 
not often included in routine stool culture (4,5). In addition, 
CIDTs do not yield isolates, which public health officials rely 
on to distinguish pathogen subtypes, determine antimicrobial 
resistance, monitor trends, and detect outbreaks. To obtain 
isolates for infections identified by CIDTs, laboratories must

perform reflex culture†; if clinical laboratories do not, the 
burden of culturing falls to state public health laboratories, 
which might not be able to absorb that burden as the adoption 
of these tests increases (2). Strategies are needed to preserve 
access to bacterial isolates for further characterization and to 
determine the effect of changing trends in testing practices 
on surveillance.
FoodNet is a collaboration among CDC, 10 state health 
departments, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food 
Safety and Inspection Service, and the Food and Drug 
Administration. FoodNet personnel conduct active, popu-
lation-based surveillance for laboratory-diagnosed infections

caused by Campylobacter, Cryptosporidium, Cyclospora, Listeria, 
Salmonella, Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC), 
Shigella, Vibrio, and Yersinia for 10 sites covering approxi-
mately 15% of the U.S. population (an estimated 49 million 
persons in 2015). Confirmed bacterial infections are defined as 
isolation of the bacterium from a clinical specimen by culture. 
Confirmed parasitic infections are defined as detection of the 
parasite from a clinical specimen by direct fluorescent antibody 
test, polymerase chain reaction, enzyme immunoassay, or light 
microscopy. CIDTs detect bacterial pathogen antigen, nucleic 
acid sequences, or for STEC, Shiga toxin or Shiga toxin genes, 
in a stool specimen or enrichment broth.§ A CIDT positive–
only bacterial infection is a positive CIDT result that was not 
confirmed by culture. Hospitalizations occurring within 7 days 
of specimen collection are recorded. The patient’s vital status 
at hospital discharge (or 7 days after specimen collection if 
not hospitalized) is also recorded. Hospitalizations and deaths 
occurring within 7 days of specimen collection are attributed 
to the infection. FoodNet also conducts surveillance for 
physician-diagnosed postdiarrheal hemolytic uremic syndrome 
(HUS), a potential complication of STEC infection, by review 
of hospital discharge data through a network of nephrologists 
and infection preventionists. This report includes HUS cases 
among persons aged <18 years for 2015, the most recent year 
with available data.
§ For Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli, only CIDT reports that were positive 
at a state public health laboratory were counted.
Incidence of infection for each pathogen is calculated 
by dividing the number of infections in 2016 by the U.S. 
Census estimates of the surveillance area population for 2015. 
Incidence is calculated for confirmed infections alone and for 
confirmed or CIDT positive–only infections combined. A 
negative binomial model with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) 
was used to estimate changes in incidence of confirmed bacte-
rial and parasitic infections and confirmed or CIDT positive–
only bacterial infections in 2016 compared with 2013–2015, 
adjusting for changes in the surveillance population over time. 
For STEC, incidence is reported for all STEC serogroups 
combined because it is not possible to distinguish between 
serogroups using CIDTs. Insufficient data were available to 
assess change for Cyclospora. For HUS, the 2015 incidence was 
compared with incidence during 2012–2014.
Cases of Infection, Incidence, and Trends
During 2016, FoodNet identified 24,029 cases, 5,512 hos-
pitalizations, and 98 deaths caused by confirmed or CIDT 
positive–only infections (Table 1). The largest number of con-
firmed or CIDT positive–only infections in 2016 was reported 
for Campylobacter (8,547), followed by Salmonella (8,172), 
Shigella (2,913), STEC (1,845),¶ Cryptosporidium (1,816), 
Yersinia (302), Vibrio (252), Listeria (127), and Cyclospora (55).

culture confirmation in 2016 was largest for Campylobacter 
(32%) and Yersinia (32%), followed by STEC (24%), Shigella 
(23%), Vibrio (13%), and Salmonella (8%). The overall 
increase in CIDT positive–only infections for these six patho-
gens in 2016 was 114% (range = 85%–1,432%) compared 
with 2013–2015. Among infections with a positive CIDT 
result in 2016, a reflex culture was attempted on approximately 
60% at either a clinical or state public health laboratory. The 
proportion of attempted reflex cultures differed by pathogen, 
ranging from 45% for Campylobacter to 86% for STEC and 
88% for Vibrio (Figure). Among infections for which reflex 
culture was performed, the proportion of infections that were 
positive was highest for Salmonella (88%) and STEC (87%), 
followed by Shigella (64%), Yersinia (59%), Campylobacter 
(52%), and Vibrio (46%).
The incidence of confirmed infections and of confirmed or 
CIDT positive–only infections per 100,000 persons was high-
est for Campylobacter (confirmed = 11.79; confirmed or CIDT 
positive–only = 17.43) and Salmonella (15.40; 16.66), fol-
lowed by Shigella (4.60; 5.94), Cryptosporidium (3.64; N/A**), 
STEC (2.85; 3.76), Yersinia (0.42; 0.62), and lowest for Vibrio

not significantly different when including confirmed or CIDT 
positive–only infections. Incidence of STEC infection was sig-
nificantly higher for confirmed infections (21% increase) and 
confirmed or CIDT positive–only infections (43% increase). 
Similarly, the incidence of Yersinia infection was significantly 
higher for both confirmed (29% increase) and confirmed or 
CIDT positive–only infections (91% increase). Incidence of 
confirmed Cryptosporidium infection was also significantly 
higher in 2016 compared with 2013–2015 (45% increase).
Among 7,554 confirmed Salmonella cases in 2016, sero-
type information was available for 6,583 (87%). The most 
common serotypes were Enteritidis (1,320; 17%), Newport 
(797; 11%), and Typhimurium (704; 9%). The incidence in 
2016 compared with 2013–2015 was significantly lower for 
Typhimurium (18% decrease; CI = 7%–21%) and unchanged 
for Enteritidis and Newport. Among 208 (95%) speciated 
Vibrio isolates, 103 (50%) were V. parahaemolyticus, 35 (17%) 
were V. alginolyticus, and 26 (13%) were V. vulnificus. Among 
1,394 confirmed and serogrouped STEC cases, 503 (36%) 
were STEC O157 and 891 (64%) were STEC non-O157. 
Among 586 (70%) STEC non-O157 isolates, the most com-
mon serogroups were O26 (190; 21%), O103 (178; 20%), and 
O111 (106; 12%). Compared with 2013–2015, the incidence 
of STEC non-O157 infections in 2016 was significantly higher 
(26% increase; CI = 9%–46%) and the incidence of STEC 
O157 was unchanged.

FoodNet identified 62 cases of postdiarrheal HUS in 
children aged <18 years (0.56 cases per 100,000) in 2015; 
33 (56%) occurred in children aged <5 years (1.18 cases per 
100,000). Compared with 2012–2014, in 2015, no signifi-
cant differences in incidence among all children or children 
aged <5 years were observed.
Discussion
The number of CIDT positive–only infections reported to 
FoodNet has been increasing markedly since 2013, as more 
clinical laboratories adopt CIDTs. Initially, increases were 
primarily limited to Campylobacter and STEC; followed by sub-
stantial increases in Salmonella and Shigella beginning in 2015 
(6). The pattern continued in 2016, with large increases in the 
number of CIDT positive–only Vibrio and Yersinia infections. 
When including both confirmed and CIDT positive–only 
infections, incidence rates in 2016 were higher for each of these 
six pathogens. The increasing use of CIDTs presents challenges 
when interpreting the corresponding increases in incidence. For 
example, the incidence of confirmed Campylobacter infections 
in 2016 was significantly lower than the 2013–2015 average. 
However, when including CIDT positive–only infections, a 
slight but not significant increase occurred. For STEC and 
Yersinia, the incidence of confirmed infections alone and 
confirmed or CIDT positive–only infections in 2016 were 
both significantly higher than the 2013–2015 average; the 
magnitude of change approximately doubled when analyzing 
CIDT positive–only infections.
Because of the ease and increasing availability of CIDTs, 
testing for some pathogens might be increasing as health 
care provider behaviors and laboratory practices evolve (2). 
Among clinical laboratories in the FoodNet catchment, the 
use of CIDTs to detect Salmonella, for which the only CIDTs 
available are DNA-based gastrointestinal syndrome panels, 
increased from 2 per 460 laboratories (<1%) in 2013 to 59 
per 421 laboratories (14%) in 2016 (FoodNet, unpublished 
data). This increased use paralleled significant increases in 
incidence of Cryptosporidium, STEC, and Yersinia, and slight 
but not significant increases in incidence of Campylobacter, 
Salmonella, Shigella, and Vibrio, all of which are also included 
in these panel tests. The increase in STEC incidence is driven 
by the increase in STEC non-O157, which is not typically 
included in routine stool culture testing because it requires 
specialized methods. Routine stool cultures performed in clini-
cal laboratories typically include methods that identify only 
Salmonella, Campylobacter, Shigella, and for some laboratories, 
STEC O157 (4,5). The increased use of the syndrome panel 
tests might increase identification, and thus, improve incidence 
estimates of pathogens for which testing was previously limited.
Results are more quickly obtained using CIDTs than 
traditional culture methods (3). Because of this, health care 
providers might be more likely to order a CIDT than tradi-
tional culture (2). Increased testing might identify infections 
that previously would have remained undiagnosed. However, 
sensitivity and specificity vary by test type. Evaluations of 
DNA-based syndrome panel tests have indicated high sen-
sitivity and specificity for most targets (3). However, among 
pathogens for which antigen-based CIDTs are often used, 
such as Campylobacter and Cryptosporidium, sensitivity and 
specificity have varied more widely, with a large number of

false positive results (7,8). Including CIDT positive infections 
to calculate incidence, some of which could be false positives, 
might provide an inaccurate estimate. When interpreting 
incidence and trends in light of changing diagnostic testing, 
considering frequency of testing, sensitivity, and specificity of 
these tests is important. The observed increases in incidence 
of confirmed or CIDT positive–only infections in 2016 com-
pared with 2013–2015 could be caused by increased testing, 
varying test sensitivity, an actual increase in infections, or a 
combination of these reasons.
These changes in testing are also important to consider when 
monitoring progress toward Healthy People 2020 objectives.†† 
The current objectives were created before the use of CIDTs 
and were based on confirmed infections. In the future, just as 
incidence measures should adjust for these changes, objectives 
should also be evaluated in light of changing diagnostics.
CIDTs pose additional challenges because they do not 
yield the bacterial isolates necessary for essential public health 
surveillance activities, such as monitoring trends in pathogen 
subtypes, conducting molecular testing, detecting outbreaks 
and implicating vehicles, and determining antimicrobial sus-
ceptibility. Reflex culture performed to yield an isolate places 
an additional burden on laboratories’ budgets, personnel, and 
time. Specimen submission requirements differ by state and 
pathogen, and this responsibility often falls to state public 
health laboratories (9). As CIDT use increases and more 
pathogens are affected, state public health laboratories will be 
challenged to sufficiently increase their testing capacity and will 
likely have to prioritize specimens on which to perform reflex 
culture (10). Clinical laboratories should review state specimen 
submission requirements and the Association of Public Health 
Laboratories guidelines§§ for reflex culture and submission of 
CIDT positive specimens.
The findings in this report are subject to at least two limita-
tions. First, the changing diagnostic landscape with unknown 
changes in frequency of testing, varying test performance, and 
decreasing availability of isolates for subtyping make inter-
preting incidence and trends more difficult. Second, changes 
in health care–seeking behavior, access to health services, or 
other population characteristics might have changed since the 
comparison period, which could affect incidence.
Foodborne illness remains a substantial public health concern 
in the United States. Previous analyses have indicated that the

Pathogens_Guidelines_0216.pdf.
number of infections far exceeds those diagnosed; CIDTs might 
be making those infections more visible (11). Most foodborne 
infections can be prevented, and substantial progress has been 
made in the past in decreasing contamination of some foods 
and reducing illness caused by some pathogens. More pre-
vention measures are needed. Surveillance data can provide 
information on where to target these measures. However, 
to accurately interpret FoodNet surveillance data in light of 
changes in diagnostic testing, more data and analytic tools are 
needed to adjust for changes in testing practices and differences 
in test characteristics. FoodNet is collecting more data and 
developing those tools. With these, FoodNet will continue to 
track the needed progress toward reducing foodborne illness.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
The incidence of infections transmitted commonly through 
food has remained largely unchanged for many years. Culture-
independent diagnostic tests (CIDTs) are increasingly used by 
clinical laboratories to detect enteric infections.
What is added by this report?
Compared with the 2013–2015 average annual incidence, the 
2016 incidence of confirmed Campylobacter infections was 
lower, incidences of confirmed Shiga toxin-producing 
Escherichia coli (STEC), Yersinia, and Cryptosporidium infections 
were higher, and incidences of confirmed or CIDT positive–only 
STEC and Yersinia infections were higher. However, CIDTs 
complicate the interpretation of surveillance data; testing for 
pathogens might occur more frequently because of changes in 
either health care provider behaviors or laboratory testing 
practices. A large proportion of CIDT positive specimens were 
not reflex cultured, which is necessary to obtain isolates for 
distinguishing pathogen subtypes, determining antimicrobial 
resistance, monitoring trends, and detecting outbreaks.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Some information about the bacteria causing infections, such as 
subtype and antimicrobial susceptibility, can only be obtained 
for CIDT positive specimens if reflex culture is performed. 
Increasing use of CIDTs affects the interpretation of public 
health surveillance data and ability to monitor progress toward 
prevention measures.
