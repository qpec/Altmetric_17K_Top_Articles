Abstract
Microbial Fuel Cells (MFCs) are emerging as an effective means of treating different types
of waste including urine and wastewater. However, the fate of pathogens in an MFC-based
system remains unknown, and in this study we investigated the effect of introducing the
enteric pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis in an MFC cascade system. The
MFCs continuously fed with urine showed high disinfecting potential. As part of two indepen-
dent trials, during which the bioluminescent S. enteritidis strain was introduced into the MFC
cascade, the number of viable counts and the level of bioluminescence were reduced by
up to 4.43±0.04 and 4.21±0.01 log-fold, respectively. The killing efficacy observed for the
MFCs operating under closed-circuit conditions, were higher by 1.69 and 1.72 log-fold
reduction than for the open circuit MFCs, in both independent trials. The results indicated
that the bactericidal properties of a well performing anode were dependent on power perfor-
mance and the oxidation-reduction potential recorded for the MFCs. This is the first time
that the fate of pathogenic bacteria has been investigated in continuously operating MFC
systems.
Introduction
A Microbial Fuel Cell (MFC) is a bioelectrochemical reactor in which organic compounds in
the feedstock are oxidised in the anodic chamber to produce carbon dioxide, protons and elec-
trons (in the form of NADH/NADPH) within the microbial cells. Feedstock fuel (utilisable
substrate) can include a wide range of compounds, from acetate and other low molecular
weight monomers, including sugars right up to particulate macromolecules and complex real
world mixtures such as sludge and urine, under anaerobic conditions in the anode chamber.
Utilisation of complex macromolecules which could be present in urine [1] implies the abun-
dance of hydrolytic activity around and within the anodic biofilm. Electrons derived from the
NADH redox reactions within the cell are transported to the anodic electrode (via direct con-
ductance or via chemical redox mediators) and then travel through the external circuit to the
cathode within the cathodic chamber, while protons generated from the biofilm on the anode
pass through a membrane, which separates both chambers [2]. The use of this technology has
attracted increasing interest in recent years, and several scaled-up applications have been

 successfully demonstrated, for treating waste products (as microbial electrolysis cells or MEC)
[3], [4] as well as for cleaning waste and producing electricity (as true Microbial Fuel Cells) [5].
The cost-effectiveness of the MFC technology [6], [7] has also been demonstrated.
Although the MFC technology has seen significant scientific development over the last
three decades, implementing this technology in real-world applications requires extensive
studies on health and sanitation hazards. These concerns have rarely been addressed.
An important part of the health risk assessment for wastewater treatment technologies con-
sists of determining the fate of enteric pathogens in-situ and ex-situ of a treatment process.
Insufficient sanitation, together with unavailability of improved water systems, leads to hun-
dreds of thousands of deaths each year, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa [8]. Therefore, the
MFC technology, which could be used in remote, off-grid areas of Developing World coun-
tries, to treat wastewater and generate electricity [9], [10], [11], offers great promise. Although
pathogens are likely to be more commonplace in fecal sludge it is common practice to separate
the solid fraction from the top liquid fractions in sludge, and the liquid fraction is usually dom-
inated by urine. Moreover, the liquid fraction can spread pathogens greater distances from the
source of contamination.
There have been some reports already published regarding the disinfection potential of
MFC-driven processes. Nevertheless, these studies were focusing on the disinfecting properties
of the synthesised catholyte, which could be a result of oxygen reduction to H2O2 [12] or elec-
tro-osmotic drag occurring in the MFCs. The H2O2 synthesis occurs spontaneously at the
cathode and was successfully employed to disinfect the effluent of a wetland system. Treating
the effluents with H2O2 solution resulted in a significant decrease of total coliforms [13].
Another approach for disinfection with the use of catholyte was described by Jadhav et al [14].
The authors supplied the cathodic chamber with sodium hypochlorite for the simultaneous
improvement of power output and disinfection, which was performed by recirculating the
anolyte through the cathodic chamber. A more recent study showed that highly alkaline catho-
lyte produced in ceramic MFCs, also possesses strong disinfecting properties; its application
resulted in significant decrease of metabolic activity of Escherichia coli [15] chosen as a repre-
sentative enteric pathogen. The production rate and properties of the catholyte are dependent
on the properties of the ceramic separator, as well as the power output. It has been reported
that the pH of the catholyte and its disinfection strength is positively correlated with the
ceramic membrane thickness [16]. Moreover, pH alone can be favourable to growth, when at
or close to neutral (pH 6.0–7.5) whilst much higher (>pH 8.0) or much lower levels (<pH 5.5)
may contribute strongly to bacterial survival or killing.
The catholyte is one example of the numerous applications that makes MFCs a platform
technology, and one that offers great promise for further investigation. However, the exposure
of MFC anodes—or any bioelectrochemical system—to pathogenic organisms in a real envi-
ronment, is a parameter that has not been assessed before, and the hypothesis is that exoge-
nous microorganisms entering an anodic MFC chamber, will be out-competed by the
established electroactive community, if the latter is thriving under, or close to maximum
power transfer conditions.
The aim of this study was to investigate the fate of one of the most important members of
the Enterobacteriaceae family, namely Salmonella enterica serotype enteritidis. This rod-shaped
gram-negative species, which may originate from sewage contamination [17], may cause food-
borne diseases. This species was introduced into an MFC cascade system treating human
urine, to determine the anodic killing efficacy when operating in continuous flow conditions.
This study used bioluminescent reporter strains to measure the rate of killing in situ and used
viable counts on selective recovery media to demonstrate that urine can be efficiently disin-
fected by the MFC cascade system.

 Materials and methods
MFC construction and operation
Ceramic earthenware cylinders were used to build open to air cathode, small scale MFCs. The
ceramic (Scientific & Chemical Supplies Ltd, UK) material was used both as the proton exchange
membrane and body of the MFC. Each ceramic cylinder was cut to maintain the internal volume
of empty MFCs equal to 11.4 mL. Carbon fiber veil with a carbon loading of 20 g/m2 was used as
the anode (PRF Composite Materials, Dorset, UK). Anodes were cut into rectangles of dimen-
sions 9×28 cm and folded to obtain a total surface area of 252 cm2 and threaded with a plain Ni-
Cr wire (Ø0.45 mm, Scientific Wire Company, UK), which was used for connection. The cath-
odes were made of conductive graphite paint as described by Winfield et al. [18]. In brief, petro-
leum spirit was used to dissolve the polyurethane rubber coating (PlastiDip, Petersfield, UK) and
mixed with graphite (Fisher Chemicals, UK) in a 1:3 (plastidip:graphite) ratio. Two layers of con-
ductive paint (carbon loading of 35.02 mgC/cm2) were applied on the surface of the ceramics
and supplied with a nickel-chromium mesh used as a current collector (20x20, 0.18 mm). The
total carbon loading for the cathode was 0.851 gC, and the projected surface area was 24.18 cm2.
The 3D printed Nanocure1 RCP30-resin lid designed with inlet and outlet tubes was used
as the front of the MFC, whilst a transparent acrylic lid (3 mm thick) was used to cover the
other side of the chamber. The RCP30-resin lids were designed using SolidWorks 2013 soft-
ware and printed with Perfactory 4 3D printer (Envisiontec, Germany). Both lids were
assembled with the MFC by a plain nylon screw (Ø3 mm, RS, UK). The detailed schematic
representation of individual MFCs has been described previously [19].
During the first trial, additional 2 cm2 of carbon veil wrapped around Ni-Cr wire were
introduced through the channel in the lid to the anolyte chamber. These removable additional
‘anodes’ had a direct physical and electrical contact with the main anode in the MFCs and
allowed the formation of the anodic biofilm. These removable anodes allowed aseptic sampling
of biofilms (by in situ detachment) to monitor the incorporation and survival of S. enteritidis
cells in the anodic biofilm.
Experimental setup
Two individual trials were run over the experimental period. The first trial consisted of a cas-
cade of 9 MFCs operating in closed circuit (CC) conditions and a separate cascade of 3 MFCs
operating in open circuit (OC) conditions (Fig 1). Both the CC and OC MFCs were inoculated
with the mixed bacterial community derived from anaerobic activated sludge (Saltford Scien-
tific Laboratory, Wessex Water, Bristol UK).
The second trial consisted of the same two cascades as trial 1, with an additional control
with 3 OC/abiotic control MFCs. This additional control cascade was setup such that its liquid
output was flowing into the input of the OC/biotic control cascade. The abiotic control MFCs
were disinfected prior to the experiment by using 70% ethanol solution, followed by washing
with sterile water and drying at 60˚C for 1 hour. All of the MFCs were separated by physical
air gap between the cells to avoid any conductive bridging between the anodes.
To estimate the killing potential against S. enteritidis and monitor its metabolic activity in
real time, a flow cell supplied with H10720 photosensor module (Hamamatsu Photonics K.K.,
Japan) was used. The sensor was introduced after the 9th MFC in CC cascade (trial 1) and after
the 3rd MFC in the OC abiotic cascade (trial 2).
Fresh neat human urine (collected not later than 24 hours before the trial and stored at
4˚C) was used as a fuel and supplied to the cascades by using a multichannel peristaltic pump
(Watson Marlow, USA) at a constant flow rate of 0.90 L/d.

 The external load connected to each MFC, was 1000 O for the initial 11 days of operation
and 250 O afterwards for the rest of the experiment. The cascade was fed with fresh human
urine as the fuel. Before the trials, the CC and OC MFCs were operated for 167 days in order
to fully allow the maturing of the anodic biofilm and to demonstrate the feasibility of disinfec-
tion in a well-established MFC system.

 Introduction of Salmonella enteritidis strain
The S. enteritidis strain was obtained from the collection of the University of the West of
England, the serotype designation was validated by serotyping [20]. The strain was carrying
the pBBR1MCS-2 plasmid derivative containing the luxCDABE operon of Photorhabdus lumi-
nescens. Prior to the experiment, the strain was subcultured in LB media containing kanamy-
cin (10 μg ml-1) as the selective agent and incubated overnight in 37˚C. Subsequently, when
the optical density at a wavelength of 600nm (OD600) reached 1.0, 15 mL of the culture was
centrifuged, washed twice with a 0.9% NaCl solution, re-suspended in 50% glycerol solution,
and stored in -20˚C until the start of the experiment. To inoculate urine with S. enteritidis,
cryopreserved bacterial cultures were centrifuged and re-suspended in 1 L of neat urine.
Monitoring the disinfection of urine
To estimate the killing potential of the MFCs in real time, the signal obtained from the photo-
sensor was calibrated with the corresponding signal from the tube luminometer GLOMAX,
20/20 (Promega, USA). The signal was therefore given in Relative Luminescence Units (RLU).
Moreover, at the end of experiment, the samples were collected from all of the sampling points
and their luminescence was assessed using a standard benchtop luminometer. In addition, at
the end of trial 1, small (2 cm2) anode pieces were removed from the anolyte chambers and
analysed in the same manner after resuspending the biofilm by sterile rod and vortexing (3
min). The quantity of Colony Forming Units (CFU) was assessed using XLD agar (Oxoid,
UK). The pH and ORP were measured with Orion Dual Star pH meter (Thermo Fisher Scien-
tific, USA).
The log reduction (LR) of colony forming units, as well as log reduction of bioluminescence
intensity was calculated using the following formula:
LR ¼ log A
B
� �
Where:
A—number of viable microorganisms or bioluminescence intensity before treatment,
B—number of viable microorganisms or bioluminescence intensity after treatment.
The standard deviation was calculated as described by Zelver et al. [21]:
SDLR ¼ ½ðS2
A=nAÞ þ ðS2
B=nBÞ�
Where:
SA and SB—the sample standard deviations of the log reduction values for samples before and
after treatment, respectively;
nA and nB−number of replicates in population before and after treatment, respectively.
Data logging and processing
MFC performances, as well as the signal from the photosensor were recorded using a Picolog
ADC-24 Data Logger (Pico Technologies, UK), with the data logging sample rate set to 3 min-
utes. The current was calculated according to Ohm’s law: I = V/R, where V is the measured
voltage in Volts (V) and R is the value of the external resistance. The power output P in Watts
(W) was calculated using equation: P = I x V. Experimental data were processed using Micro-
soft Excel 2010 and plotted by GraphPad Prism 5.0 software.

 Statistical analysis
The LR data was analysed using Shapiro-Wilk normality test and t-student test (α = 0.05) to
determine the significance of difference between the means. All statistical analysis was per-
formed using R statistical environment.
Ethics statement
This research involved the use of human urine. The appropriate written consent was given by
all individuals participating in the study. This research was approved by NHS (12/YH/0493)
and University of the West of England Research Ethics Committee (112207).
Results and discussion
From previous work, it was established that this type of MFCs could reach power output levels
of the order of 105.5±32.2 μW [19]. However, during long-term operation, undesirable
cathodic biofilm formation caused deterioration of performance. Therefore, the first trial
described in the current study, was performed when MFCs produced only 31.2±9.2 μW (Fig
2), which corresponds to 29.5% of the best performance. During the second trial, the biofilm
formed at the cathodes was removed, thus the power recorded over the experimental period
increased to 65.3±9.3 μW. In both trials, the power performance recorded for individual
MFCs was stable and indicated that the fuel supplied to the MFCs, at constant flow rate and in
controlled temperature conditions, was utilised at constant reaction rates. The stable power
output was the result of the stable metabolic rate and cell population number [22] giving con-
stant electrochemical conditions, which in turn helped to stabilise the whole system, rendering
it reliable for investigating the disinfection efficacy of the target reporter species.
The luminescence observed for the whole experimental period did not exceed 3.93×103
RLU. In contrast, a strong signal reaching 1.73×106 RLU was recorded when the photosensor
was introduced to the abiotic control (Fig 3). The immediate response of the sensor was
observed after the second hour of the experiment, when all of the MFCs in the triplet were
fully filled with urine, allowing the treated urine to pass through the sensor chamber. There-
fore, the real-time monitoring of bioluminescence intensity with the photosensor introduced
in two different sampling points, revealed that the environment within the closed circuit
MFCs, was indeed hostile to the pathogens, suppressing microbial activity of exogenous bacte-
ria. The bioluminescence reaching up to 1.73×106 RLU in the case of the abiotic control, indi-
cated that none of the materials used to construct the MFCs, nor the conditions occurring in
abiotic OC MFCs were toxic against the S. enteritidis strain. Although the data from the photo-
sensor were generated from two cascades with a different number of units, the luminescence
results were confirmed by analyzing the samples collected from both cascades (3rd unit in each
cascade), using the benchtop luminometer (Fig 4).
Monitoring the microbial activity and viability in all of the sampling points, as well as dur-
ing the inoculation of the MFCs with S. enteritidis allowed the determination of the log-reduc-
tion (LR) values for the above-mentioned parameters. In both trials, a positive effect (negative
LR values) on microbial viability (CFU) and metabolic activity (reflected by RLU—biolumi-
nescence being dependent on metabolic rate) was observed as a result of 18 hours of incuba-
tion in batch culture (bottle tx). Moreover, only negligible difference was observed when
comparing RLU LR values of batch culture (bottle tx) and the inlet to the cascade (inlet tx). The
differences recorded in the CFU LR values were probably the result of experimental variance
in sampling bacterial cells undergoing sedimentation in batch culture. This demonstrated that
there was no disinfection effect prior to entering the cascade system, that might have been
caused by mechanical pressure derived from peristaltic pump or redox reactions occurring

 during the residence within the silicon tubing. Similarly, only negligible negative effects (posi-
tive LR values) were observed, when the pathogenic cells were processed through the abiotic
OC cascade (ac3). The retention of pathogenic cells in abiotic MFCs may have initiated the
adsorption, sedimentation and biofilm formation mechanisms.
It is known, that Salmonella species are able to form a biofilm structure on various types of
substrata [23], [24], thus some positive effect (decrease of viability) may have been caused by
the accumulation of its metabolic by-products, or simply by attachment of the dead or dying
bacterial cells to the biofilm. On the other hand, when the biofilm was removed from the 2cm2
of anode at the end of trial 1, none of the viable Salmonella sp. cells were detected neither in
open circuit nor closed circuit MFCs (Table 1). Similarly, the observed LR values for

 luminescence were indicating that none of the Salmonella enteritidis cells were incorporated to
the matured biofilm.
The log-reduction of RLU value calculated for the abiotic OC cascade (ac3) was 3 orders of
magnitude lower than that from the closed circuit MFCs, which is also consistent with the
results obtained from the real time luminescence monitoring. Nevertheless, a significant
(p<0.05) disinfecting effect was observed for the biotic OC control (oc3). The RLU LR values
reached 3.13±0.02 LR and 3.64±0.04 LR in two individual trials, while the CFU LR observed
for Trial 2 was equal to 2.71±0.05 LR and 0.16±0.15 LR for Trial 1. In all cases, the LR values
were still lower when compared to those observed from the closed circuit MFCs, showing that
the killing potential of OC MFCs was much lower than that of the CC MFCs. The difference in
CFU LR values when comparing both trials indicates that perhaps the weak disinfecting prop-
erties observed from the biotic OC control, could have been the result of lytic or hydrolytic
biochemical reactions, which were dependent on the length of time that individual MFCs were

 running for. Trials 1 and 2 were performed in two different periods of time, resulting in two
different power performance levels (as shown on Fig 2). The cathode regeneration procedure
[19], was not carried out for the OC MFCs, thus a significant deterioration of the electrodes
could have affected the overall OC MFC environment and biofilm metabolism. The ORP val-
ues, reaching -490.7 mV (vs SHE), which is the highest negative ORP observed in this study,
indicated good dynamic/electrochemical conditions within the OC MFCs (Fig 4). The sub-
optimum power output conditions occurring in the CC MFCs (31μW Trial 1 & 65μW Trial 2
vs 105μW max recorded [15]) may have allowed antagonistic (to electron transfer) fermenta-
tion processes. Such conditions could have a negative effect on the killing efficacy, suppressing
the overall capabilities of the MFCs.
Although the killing effect on S. enteritidis was observed for the biotic OC control, the
CFU LR values observed for the corresponding closed circuit MFCs were significantly higher
(p<0.05). Moreover (with one exception), the LR values were increasing after the treatment
in each triplet of CC MFCs, reaching up to 4.43±0.04 LR at the end of the cascade. The pH of
urine increased from pH 6.8 (when fresh) to as high as pH 8.94–9.59 thus helping to antago-
nize the growth of Salmonella in all of the inoculated, biotic MFCs, while the ORP, moni-
tored for Trial 2 indicated a highly reducing environment. Moreover, a linear decrease of
ORP was noticed along the CC cascade. These values of CFU LR are in agreement with those
observed when the hydrogen peroxide derived from cathodic reactions was used against coli-
forms [13].
It is therefore hypothesised that the cascade effect was creating favourable conditions for
the removal of pathogenic species from urine by the sequential increase of the reducing force,
along with the increase of the pH. The good decrease of the ORP force and increase of the pH,
together with the lower LR observed for the OC biotic control (oc3) suggest that ORP and pH
were two important factors influencing the killing potential of MFCs. However, although
direct effect of ORP and pH on pathogen inactivation was observed, the LR values achieved for
closed circuit MFCs were higher than the open circuit controls in all trials. The closed circuit
MFCs reached higher LR values in comparison to OC MFCs for which the recorded pH was
comparable or even higher (Trial 1 –Fig 4) than for the closed circuit MFCs. Therefore, the
results suggest that the increase of pH, caused by the urea hydrolysis was not the only factor
contributing to the inactivation of the pathogens. It is assumed that the bioelectrochemical
reactions generating electric current were introducing additional stress mechanisms against
the pathogenic cells, thus increasing the disinfection effect during the treatment of human
waste in MFCs.
To further investigate this hypothesis, linear regression models were tested for ORP, power
and LR variables (Fig 5). The highest correlation coefficients were calculated when the effect of
power generated by the MFCs on CFU:LR and ORP on RLU:LR were investigated, respec-
tively. These results indicate that although both factors were well describing the LR variables,
the change in ORP had a more marked effect on the metabolic activity of the pathogens, whilst
power output had higher impact on the viability of pathogenic bacteria. It is therefore con-
cluded that both of these factors played a role in creating a hostile environment for the patho-
genic bacteria. The results also indicate that oxidising the urine constituents in current-
generating pathways have induced a killing effect when compared to the non-current generat-
ing pathways occurring in both types of OC controls.
The negative ORP was driven by the current-producing reactions. The decrease of meta-
bolic activity observed by the decrease of the bioluminescence was followed by a decrease of
viability. Such a decrease in viable counts of E. coli was also observed, when the negative
potential was artificially supplied to the carbon fiber electrode, resulting in over 3 log-fold
reduction [25]. It is therefore assumed, that the negative anodic potential created in MFCs

 treating urine may lead to the inhibition of the respiratory chains of bacteria and conse-
quently, death of the cells.
The decrease of the viability of the representative serovar of Salmonellae observed in this
study was of a higher magnitude, when compared to conventional wastewater treatment
plants. In a comprehensive study reported by Koivunen et al. [26] the authors have identified
32 different Salmonella serovars and recorded removal efficiency of 2 and 3 log units during
treatment in biological-chemical reactors and tertiary filtration units. Increased killing effi-
ciency was observed when UV or ozone were used to treat wastewater [27]. The disinfection
efficiency observed in this study is similar to the more recently described method of electro-
poration using a conductive nanosponge [28]. These authors recorded a disinfection effi-
ciency reaching up to 6 log-fold reduction of enteric bacteria (including Salmonella enterica
serovar typhimurium). Nevertheless, the voltage externally applied to the anode was 2 orders
of magnitude higher than that produced by the MFCs used in this study and an additional
disinfectant was used to induce the killing process. It is possible that the power production
in MFCs may have a similar effect on pathogenic bacteria. The electrochemical process
described herewith, may lead to the increased uptake of ionic species to the interior of bacte-
rial cells.
It is also assumed that the kill rates observed in this study may have also resulted from the
formation of ionic-redox chemical species that led to negative ORP. In addition, the role and
contribution of other potential bacteriocidal mechanisms (e.g. lytic enzymes, antibiotics, bac-
teriocins or other toxic molecules) has not been investigated in the present study. Considering
that closed circuit MFCs have shown significantly higher killing efficiency, it is concluded that
the production of electric power resulted in changing both the physico-chemical parameters of
urine and influenced the integrity of the bacterial cells, leading to a high killing efficacy in a
continuously operating MFC system.
