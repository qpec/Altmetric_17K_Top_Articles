ABSTRACT 
18 
Neocortex contains a multitude of cell types segregated into layers and functionally distinct regions. To 
19 
investigate the diversity of cell types across the mouse neocortex, we analyzed 12,714 cells from the 
20 
primary visual cortex (VISp), and 9,035 cells from the anterior lateral motor cortex (ALM) by deep single-
21 
cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), identifying 116 transcriptomic cell types. These two regions represent 
22 
distant poles of the neocortex and perform distinct functions. We define 50 inhibitory transcriptomic cell 
23 
types, all of which are shared across both cortical regions. In contrast, 49 of 52 excitatory transcriptomic 
24 
types were found in either VISp or ALM, with only three present in both. By combining single cell RNA-
25 
seq and retrograde labeling, we demonstrate correspondence between excitatory transcriptomic types and 
26 
their region-specific long-range target specificity. This study establishes a combined transcriptomic and 
27 
projectional taxonomy of cortical cell types from functionally distinct regions of the mouse cortex.

INTRODUCTION 
30 
The neocortex coordinates most flexible and learned behaviors. Based on cytoarchitectonic, neurochemical, 
31 
connectional and functional studies, up to 180 distinct cortical areas have been identified in humans 
32 
(Glasser et al., 2016) and dozens in rodents (Kolb, 1990; Ng et al., 2009). Cortical areas are often 
33 
categorized as sensory, motor or associational, based on their connections with other brain areas. Each 
34 
cortical area has a laminar structure (layers (L) 1-6). Most sensory areas contain L4, and they are termed 
35 
'granular', whereas motor and associational areas usually do not have L4, and are hence 'agranular'. In 
36 
vertebrate evolution, cortex underwent disproportionally greater expansion in terms of the number of cells, 
37 
layers and functional areas compared to the rest of the brain, coinciding with the acquisition of increasingly 
38 
sophisticated cognitive functions (Jerison, 2009; Kaas, 2009; Man et al., 2013; Van Essen et al., 2016). 
39 
Therefore, a systematic characterization of the structure and function of neocortex is essential for 
40 
understanding neural mechanisms underlying cognition and behavior in animals and human. 
41 
Much effort has been devoted to understanding the extent of cortical cellular diversity and how the 
42 
dynamics of cortical neural activity emerges from its structure – often referred to as the cortical circuit. 
43 
Although cortical areas share some features including layered organization and certain connectivity 
44 
patterns, neurons in different cortical areas show qualitatively different activity patterns that support 
45 
different cortical computations. At one extreme, granular primary visual (VISp) and other sensory cortical 
46 
areas process sensory information with millisecond time-scale dynamic (Cardin et al., 2010; Durand et al., 
47 
2016; Liu et al., 2009). Agranular frontal areas, including prefrontal cortex and motor cortex, such as the 
48 
anterior lateral motor cortex (ALM) in mice, show slow dynamics related to short-term memory, 
49 
deliberation, decision-making and planning (Chen et al., 2017; Guo et al., 2017; Guo et al., 2014). 
50 
Categorizing cortical neurons into distinct types, and studying the roles of different types in the function of 
51 
the circuit, is an essential step towards understanding how these different cortical circuits produce distinct 
52 
computations (Svoboda and Li, 2017; Zeng and Sanes, 2017).  
53 
Previous studies, mainly in the rodent primary somatosensory, visual, and motor cortices, have identified 
54 
multiple types of glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons (Molyneaux et al., 2007; Rudy et al., 2011). 
55 
Recent large-scale neurophysiological and anatomical studies have attempted more comprehensive 
56 
descriptions of cortical neuronal types, identifying dozens to hundreds of putative cell types (Jiang et al., 
57 
2015; Markram et al., 2015). An alternative approach to taxonomy relies on genome-wide gene expression 
58 
by single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), in combination with unsupervised feature selection and 
59 
cluster analysis (Li et al., 2017; Macosko et al., 2015; Pollen et al., 2015; Shekhar et al., 2016; Tasic et al., 
60 
2016; Zeisel et al., 2015). In a scRNA-seq study on mouse neocortical and hippocampal cells, 3,005 cells 
61 
were profiled, leading to the identification of 29 neuronal transcriptomic types (Zeisel et al., 2015). We 
62 
previously obtained scRNA-seq data from 1,679 cells from the mouse primary visual cortex (VISp) and 
63 
classified them into 19 excitatory, 23 inhibitory, and 7 non-neuronal types (Tasic et al., 2016). Reconciling 
64 
the morphological, neurophysiological and scRNA-seq data into a consensus picture of cortical neuronal 
65 
types remains a major challenge.  
66 
A major advantage of scRNA-seq compared to other approaches to neuronal characterization is scalability. 
67 
We leveraged it to conduct a large-scale scRNA-seq study of neocortical cell types with two goals in mind. 
68 
First, to profile a sufficient number of VISp neurons to saturate the discovery of new transcriptomic cell 
69 
types with our scRNA-seq approach. Second, to profile a different cortical area (ALM) at similar depth to 
70 
test how cortical neuronal types vary across cortical areas with distinct functions.  
71 
Using SMART-Seq v4-based deep sequencing approach, we profiled more than 22,000 VISp and ALM 
72 
cells isolated from a diverse set of Cre lines, as well as from retrograde labeling. Dimensionality reduction 
73 
and clustering of the dataset gave rise to 116 transcriptomic types, 67 of which are shared between the two 
74 
areas. Overall, this represents the most comprehensive cortical cell type classification to date. We find that 
75 
interneuron and non-neuronal types are shared between the two cortical areas, whereas most excitatory 
76 
neuron types are unique to each area. By combining retrograde labeling with scRNA-seq, we reveal clear

correlation between excitatory neuron projection patterns and their transcriptomic identities. Finally, we 
78 
provide correspondence to known cell types, and identify numerous genetic markers that can be used to 
79 
build tools, including several transgenic recombinase lines presented here, to study the identified 
80 
transcriptomic types in the future. Together with the accompanying paper (Economo et al., 2017), our study 
81 
suggests a general principle: distinct computations in different cortical areas are based on their molecularly 
82 
distinct projection neurons and their multi-regional connections.

RESULTS 
85 
Overall cell type taxonomy 
86 
Building on our previous pilot study (Tasic et al., 2016), we established a scRNA-seq pipeline with 
87 
optimized, SMART-Seq v4 based methodology, standard operating procedures and stringent quality control 
88 
(QC) criteria (Extended Data Figs. 1 and 2). Individual cells were isolated by fluorescence activated cell 
89 
sorting (FACS) or manual sorting, cDNA was generated and amplified by SMART-Seq v4, and Nextera 
90 
XT-tagmented libraries were sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq2500 platform (Methods). The major 
91 
methodological differences between the previous pilot study and the current pipeline include the use of a 
92 
N-methyl-D-glucamine (NMDG)-based artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) to improve neuronal survival 
93 
(Ting et al., 2014) and replacement of Clontech’s SMARTer v1 with SMART-Seq v4 kit (Methods). 
94 
SMART-Seq v4 is based on Smart-seq2 (Picelli et al., 2013), and increases gene-detection efficiency 
95 
compared to SMARTer v1 (Ramskold et al., 2012) used in our previous study (Tasic et al., 2016). This 
96 
allowed us to reduce the median sequencing depth from ~8.7 to ~2.6 million reads per cell while still 
97 
detecting ~8,200 genes per cell (median) compared to ~7,800 previously (Extended Data Fig. 2b). This 
98 
dataset represents the largest survey of single-cell transcriptomics data (57.18×109 reads) from the 
99 
neocortex in any species to date. 
100 
For clustering, we used 21,749 QC-qualified single-cell transcriptomes from VISp and ALM of adult mice 
101 
(postnatal day P56±3) of both sexes in the congenic C57BL/6J background (Extended Data Fig. 1a, 
102 
Methods). To cover neuronal cell types as comprehensively as possible while retaining layer-of-origin 
103 
information, we employed layer-enriching dissections from ALM and VISp of pan-neuronal, pan-
104 
excitatory or pan-inhibitory recombinase lines crossed to recombinase reporters (referred to as the PAN 
105 
collection) consisting of 11,153 cells (Extended Data Fig. 1b, Extended Data Table 1). To sample non-
106 
neuronal cells, we collected 816 reporter-negative cells (408 from ALM and VISp, each) from a pan-
107 
neuronal Snap25-IRES-Cre line. To compensate for cell type-specific survival biases and to collect rare 
108 
types, we supplemented the PAN collection with 7,919 cells isolated from a variety of other recombinase 
109 
lines, with or without layer-enriching dissections. These recombinase lines were selected to capture 
110 
additional cellular diversity suggested by ongoing analysis of the PAN-collection data (Extended Data 
111 
Fig. 1b,e,f). Finally, to investigate the correspondence between transcriptomic types and projection 
112 
properties, 2,677 retrogradely labeled cells were sequenced.  
113 
To define transcriptomic types, single-cell transcriptomes were subjected to feature extraction and 
114 
clustering (Extended Data Fig. 2c, Methods). To extract relevant transcriptomic features, we employed 
115 
dimensionality reduction by weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) (Langfelder and 
116 
Horvath, 2008). We combined this approach with hierarchical and graph clustering in an iterative and 
117 
bootstrapped manner (Extended Data Fig. 2c). The output of this procedure is a co-clustering matrix: a 
118 
cell-cell matrix that indicates the frequency with which any cell clusters with any other cell in 100 
119 
bootstrapped iterative clustering rounds (Extended Data Fig. 3a). Final transcriptomic cell types are 
120 
defined by 'cutting' the co-clustering matrix to derive membership of each cell to a cluster (116 clusters 
121 
total). Each cell’s membership also is tested post-clustering by classification algorithms to assign core vs. 
122 
intermediate identity to cells (Methods, Extended Data Fig. 2c) (Tasic et al., 2016). Cells that are reliably 
123 
classified to only one cluster (in >90 of 100 trials) are labeled “core” cells (19,195 cells), whereas cells that 
124 
fall into more than one cluster are labeled “intermediate” cells. The vast majority of intermediate cells are

assigned to only two clusters (2,542 of 2,554; 99.5%). The sequencing depth and gene detection per cluster 
126 
are shown in Extended Data Fig. 4.  
127 
The identity of each cluster was assigned based on previously reported and newly discovered differentially 
128 
expressed markers (Extended Data Figs. 5 and 6) and resulted in 52 glutamatergic, 50 GABAergic and 
129 
14 non-neuronal types (Fig. 1). These types correspond well to the 49 types from our previous study, with 
130 
some boundaries between types shifted and better resolution provided in the current dataset (Extended 
131 
Data Fig. 7). In addition, we now detect some rare types that were not sampled in the previous dataset. To 
132 
determine if our sampling reached a plateau for cell type identification, we subsampled cells from the 
133 
dataset and evaluated the stability of cluster identity with fewer cells. We find that for the vast majority of 
134 
clusters, we sampled many more cells than needed to define them, whereas for a few (e.g., certain non-
135 
neuronal types, L5 PT and L6b types), additional sampling may reveal additional diversity (Extended Data 
136 
Fig. 8). 
137 
A clear hierarchy of transcriptomic cell types and their relationships has emerged (Fig. 1). Consistent with 
138 
previous reports (Tasic et al., 2016; Zeisel et al., 2015), the biggest differences in transcriptomic profiles 
139 
are observed between non-neuronal and neuronal cells. We find that non-neuronal cells (n = 1,105 cells) 
140 
are divided into two major branches according to their developmental origin: neuroectoderm-derived 
141 
branch, which contains astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, and non-neuroectoderm-derived, which includes 
142 
immune cells (microglia, perivascular macrophages), blood vessel-associated cells (smooth muscle cells, 
143 
pericytes, and endothelial cells), and vascular leptomeningeal cells (VLMCs) (Extended Data Fig. 9). We 
144 
identified previously described non-neuronal types, but also find pericytes and four different types of 
145 
VLMCs with unique, previously unknown markers (Extended Data Fig. 9). The pericyte definition has 
146 
been a matter of a debate due to their diverse morphologies and shared marker expression with smooth 
147 
muscle cells, including Acta2 (smooth muscle actin, α-SMA), Pdgfrb, and Cpsg (proteoglycan NG2) 
148 
(Attwell et al., 2016). We find one transcriptomic cell type that specifically expresses Kcnj8 and Abcc9, 
149 
which have been identified as brain pericyte markers (Bondjers et al., 2006), and define additional markers 
150 
uniquely expressed in this cell type (Atp13a5, Art3, Pla1a, and Ace2) that may help solidify pericyte identity 
151 
in future studies (Extended Data Fig. 9).  
152 
Most neurons fall into two major branches corresponding to cortical glutamatergic and GABAergic types 
153 
(Fig. 1). As exceptions, two very distinct types stand out: CR-Trp73, and Meis2, which are positioned in 
154 
the taxonomy as two distant branches preceding the major glutamatergic/GABAergic split. Based on the 
155 
marker expression and cell source, Meis2 type corresponds to the recently described Meis2-expressing 
156 
GABAergic neuronal type of unknown function that is largely confined to the white matter, and originates 
157 
from the embryonic pallial–subpallial boundary (Frazer et al., 2017). This type expresses the smallest 
158 
number of genes (median = 3,863, Extended Data Fig. 4b) and is the only cortical GABAergic cell that 
159 
reliably expresses the transcription factor Meis2. The other type corresponds to Cajal-Retzius (CR) cells 
160 
based on their location in L1 and expression of Trp73, Lhx5 and Reln (Extended Data Fig. 6), known 
161 
markers of this cell type (Abellan et al., 2010; Kirischuk et al., 2014). Interestingly, CR cells of 
162 
hippocampus and neocortex also originate from a distinct germinal zone, the cortical hem (Yoshida et al., 
163 
2006). 
164 
All other neuronal types fall into two major classes in accordance with the main neurotransmitter they 
165 
express: GABA or glutamate. Every GABAergic neuronal type contains cells from both ALM and VISp 
166 
(Fig. 1). That is, inhibitory GABAergic interneuron types are shared between these two cortical areas. In 
167 
contrast, the glutamatergic types are segregated by region (with the exception of two L6b types and CR 
168 
cells). Glutamatergic types segregate by global projections, cortical layer, and area, usually in that order 
169 
(Fig. 1, see below).

GABAergic cell type taxonomy 
173 
We define five subclasses within the GABAergic taxonomy: Lamp5, Sncg, Vip, Sst and Pvalb, and two 
174 
distinct types Sst-Chodl, and Meis2 (Fig. 1). Within each subclass there are multiple types (Fig. 2). We 
175 
represent the taxonomy derived from the current dataset by hierarchical clustering (Fig. 1, Fig. 2c,d) and 
176 
constellation diagrams, which incorporate information on core and and intermediate cells (Fig. 2a,b). In 
177 
addition, we illustrate layer-of-origin for cells collected from layer-enriching dissections (Fig. 2c,d), as well 
178 
as the distribution of expression of individual marker genes within each type (Fig. 2e,f). 
179 
The GABAergic cells are divided into two major classes, mostly corresponding to their developmental 
180 
origin in the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE: Pvalb and Sst types) or caudal ganglionic eminence (CGE: 
181 
Lamp5, Sncg and Vip types). The developmental origins of some of the types have not been established; 
182 
for example, Lamp5-Lhx6 type may originate from the MGE (see Discussion). Many inhibitory types 
183 
display layer-specific enrichments (Fig. 2c,d). The Sst and Pvalb subclasses within the Sst/Pvalb 
184 
constellation are connected at two different points: one connection occurs between two upper-layer types 
185 
(Sst-Etv1-4 and Pvalb-Ilrapl2) and the other between two deeper-layer types (Sst-Nts and Pvalb-Th) (Fig. 
186 
2a). The CGE-derived interneurons, united under the umbrella of Htr3a-GFP transgene expression (Rudy 
187 
et al., 2011), fall into Lamp5, Vip, and Sncg subclasses that are represented by three interconnected 
188 
neighborhoods in the constellation diagram (Fig. 2b). The complicated landscapes are the result of many 
189 
genes expressed in a combinatorial and graded fashion (Extended Data Figs. 5 and 6), resulting in high 
190 
co-clustering frequencies (Extended Data Fig. 3a) and many intermediate cells. 
191 
The GABAergic transcriptomic taxonomy overlaps with previously reported interneuron types based on 
192 
marker gene expression, transgenic lines, published Patch-seq and other scRNA-seq data (Extended Data 
193 
Table 2, Extended Data Figs. 10 and 11). The transcriptomic taxonomy now provides a global context 
194 
for these more focused studies of interneuron types. Some of the most distinct types are Meis2 (discussed 
195 
above), and Sst-Chodl, which corresponds to Nos1-expressing long-range projecting interneurons, based 
196 
on marker gene expression, location, Cre line labeling, and other RNA-seq data (Extended Data Table 2, 
197 
Extended Data Figs. 10a, 11) (He et al., 2016; Paul et al., 2017; Tasic et al., 2016).  
198 
For the Pvalb subclass, we confirm that the Pvalb-Vipr2 type (named Pvalb-Cpne5 in our previous study 
199 
(Tasic et al., 2016)), corresponds to chandelier cells by high confidence mapping of the recently reported 
200 
chandelier cell 1 (CHC1) type RNA-seq data (Paul et al., 2017) to our Pvalb-Vipr2 type (Extended Data 
201 
Fig. 10a). We also used the newly discovered genetic marker Vipr2 to develop Vipr2-IRES2-Cre for access 
202 
to chandelier cells without requiring tamoxifen induction, which is necessary for chandelier cell labeling 
203 
by the Nkx2.1-CreERT2 line (Extended Data Figs. 11, 12a-f). Most other Pvalb types correspond to basket 
204 
cells (Extended Data Fig. 10a,b) (Paul et al., 2017), except for two L6-enriched types (Pvalb-Th and 
205 
Pvalb-Gabrg1) whose identities are still elusive.  
206 
Within the Lamp5/Vip/Sncg subclasses, we find evidence for correspondences to neurogliaform, bipolar, 
207 
single bouquet, and CCK basket cells (Extended Data Table 2). The newly defined Sncg subclass 
208 
corresponds to the Vip+ and Cck+ multipolar or basket cells and is distinct from the cells of the Vip subclass 
209 
that are also Calb2+ and have mostly bipolar morphologies (Fig. 2f, Extended Data Fig. 10a)(He et al., 
210 
2016; Paul et al., 2017; Rudy et al., 2011). We previously assigned neurogliaform cell (NGC) identity to 
211 
Ndnf types (Tasic et al., 2016), which correspond to several current Lamp5 types (Extended Data Fig. 7). 
212 
We confirm this finding by computational mapping of Patch-seq data (Cadwell et al., 2016) to our data 
213 
(Extended Data Fig. 10d-f) to find excellent correspondence of NGCs to our Lamp5-Pdlim5 and Lamp5-
214 
Slc35d3 types. In addition, we find that single bouquet cells (SBCs) map to the Lamp5-Egln3_2 type 
215 
(Extended Data Fig. 10d,e), and find a possible transitional SBC/NGC type, Lamp5-Egln3_3 (Extended 
216 
Data Fig. 10d).

The Lamp5-Lhx6 type is unusual because it clusters with other Lamp5 types, but is the only one expressing 
218 
transcripts encoding the typical MGE transcription factors, Nkx2.1 and Lhx6. Consistent with the marker 
219 
gene expression, this type is labeled by Nkx2.1-CreERT2 (Extended Data Fig. 11) and was isolated by 
220 
Paul et al. from the same Cre line (Extended Data Fig. 10a-c). Intriguingly, we find that the chandelier 
221 
type 2 cells (CHC2) RNA-seq data (Paul et al., 2017) map exceptionally well to our Lamp5-Lhx6 type 
222 
(Extended Data Fig. 10a,b), which is transcriptomically most related to Lamp5 neurogliaform types. 
223 
The Sst subclass exhibits diverse transcriptomic types, currently with only a few clear correspondences 
224 
with known Sst+ morphological types, in addition to the above-mentioned Sst-Chodl type. The Sst-Etv1_3 
225 
type corresponds to the Sst+ and Calb2+ L2/3 Martinotti cells (Fig. 2e, Extended Data Fig. 10a) (He et 
226 
al., 2016; Paul et al., 2017; Rudy et al., 2011). Some of the Sst-Myh8 types (Sst-Myh8_2 and Sst_Myh8_3) 
227 
and the Sst-Tac2 type express the Chrna2 marker gene, and thereby likely correspond to L5 Martinotti cells 
228 
(Hilscher et al., 2017). 
229 
 
230 
Glutamatergic cell type taxonomy based on scRNA-seq and projections 
231 
Most excitatory neurons in the cortex project to other brain regions, including other cortical regions, and 
232 
genetic markers have been correlated with projectional properties (Molyneaux et al., 2007; Sorensen et al., 
233 
2015) (Harris and Shepherd, 2015). To inquire how transcriptomic and projectional identities of excitatory 
234 
neurons correlate with each other, we included 2,677 cells labeled by retrograde injections (Retro-seq 
235 
dataset, Fig. 3a) in our single cell transcriptomics dataset. The projection targets of VISp and ALM (Fig. 
236 
3b, Extended Data Fig. 13) were selected based on the Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas (Oh et al., 
237 
2014) and other anatomical data (Li et al., 2015). Retrogradely labeled cells were isolated after viral 
238 
infections, and were processed for single cell RNA-seq through the same experimental and data processing 
239 
pipeline, including joint clustering with cells isolated from transgenic lines. The clustering was performed 
240 
blind to the identity of retrogradely labeled cells, and these cells were only used post-clustering to represent 
241 
the correspondence between projectional and transcriptomic properties.  
242 
The presence of retrogradely labeled cells in transcriptomic clusters revealed their projection patterns (Figs. 
243 
3 and 4). Intratelencephalic (IT) types, constituted the largest branch, whereas pyramidal tract (PT) types, 
244 
near-projecting (NP) types, and corticothalamic (CT) types constituted separate branches. All branches 
245 
contained related types from both areas (Fig. 4a). The only subclass dominated by layer identity was L6b 
246 
subclass.  
247 
IT types from both areas are present in all layers except L1, they express previously reported layer-specific 
248 
or enriched markers (Fig. 4a,b, Extended Data Fig. 6) and map well to our previously detected types 
249 
(Extended Data Table 2, Extended Data Fig. 7) (Tasic et al., 2016). They display a significant number 
250 
of intermediate cells, which connect types within a layer or in neighboring layers (Fig. 3d,f). We also define 
251 
a distinct IT type, VISp L6 IT-Car3, which expresses a unique combination of many markers including 
252 
Car3, Oprk1 and Nr2f2 (Fig. 4a,b), some of which have been previously detected in the claustrum (Wang 
253 
et al., 2017). Examination of the Allen Brain Atlas RNA ISH data shows that these genes are expressed in 
254 
a sparse population of L6 neurons located in the lateral portion of VISp and continuing laterally towards 
255 
the claustrum (Extended Data Fig. 14). 
256 
We performed anterograde tracing by Cre-dependent adeno-associated virus (AAV) in select Cre lines (Fig. 
257 
5a) to examine the cortico-cortical projection patterns of different IT types in more detail. We find cases 
258 
where different types project to different cortical areas, or different types project to different layers within 
259 
the same projection area. L5 and L2/3 IT types as labeled in Tlx3-Cre_PL56, and Cux2-IRES-Cre lines

upper layers (Fig. 5b,c). In contract, L6 IT types, labeled in the newly generated Penk-IRES2-Cre-neo line 
262 
(Extended Data Fig. 11), project to many of the same areas as the L2/3 and L5 IT types, but their 
263 
projections are confined to lower layers in all areas examined, including higher visual areas and 
264 
contralateral VISp and ALM (Fig. 5d). As revealed by our Retro-seq data (Extended Data Fig. 13b), we 
265 
confirm that L4-Rspo1 type, which represents most cells labeled by Nr5a1-Cre (Extended Data Fig. 11) 
266 
projects to contralateral VISp (Fig. 5e). Interestingly, this projection is observed only when injection is 
267 
performed in the most anterior portion of VISp (compare left and right panels in Fig. 5e).  
268 
Cortico-subcortical projecting, or pyramidal-tract (PT) neurons, which are the descending output neurons 
269 
in L5, share a separate branch in the taxonomy tree and express previously known markers like Bcl6 
270 
(Sorensen et al., 2015) and a new marker Fam84b (Fig. 4a,b). The PT transcriptomic types in ALM 
271 
correspond to two projection classes (Economo et al., 2017, accompanying paper): two transcriptomic types 
272 
project to thalamus (ALM L5 PT-Htr3c and -Hpgd), whereas the third projects to the medulla (ALM L5 
273 
PT-Rgs8, Extended Data Fig. 13a). These PT types have distinct functions in planning and initiating 
274 
voluntary movements (Economo et al., 2017, accompanying paper). Likewise, it appears that PT types from 
275 
VISp display differential subcortical projections (Extended Data Fig. 13b); however new tools specific 
276 
for individual L5 PT types will be needed to confirm this possibility.  
277 
Cortico-thalamic (CT) L6a types share the transcription factor marker Foxp2, and may have type-specific 
278 
preferences for different thalamic nuclei: VISp L6 CT-Dlx4 and -Ctxn3 types appear to more preferentially 
279 
project to LGd, whereas VISp L6 CT-Ptprt roughly equally targets LP, LD and LGd (Extended Data Fig. 
280 
13b).  
281 
L6b types share marker genes for subplate neurons, such as Cplx3, Ctgf and Nxph4 (Ayoub and Kostovic, 
282 
2009; Lein et al., 2007; Zeng et al., 2012). We find two L6b types that are shared between the two areas: 
283 
L6b-Mup3 and L6b-P2ry12. Based on the Retro-seq dataset, one of the L6b types (VISp L6b-Rprm), which 
284 
shares a number of markers with L6a CT types including Rprm and Crym, also projects to thalamus. The 
285 
dendrograms (Figs. 1c and 3e) capture only the dominant relationship between L6b types, whereas the 
286 
constellation diagram can accommodate more complicated relationships showing intermediate cells 
287 
between VISp L6b-Rprm and VISp L6 CT-Ptprt (Fig. 3f). Anterograde tracing in Ctgf-T2A-dgCre mice 
288 
shows that L6b neurons have predominant projections into L1 that spread to many neighboring cortical 
289 
areas in both VISp and ALM (Fig. 5f). In agreement with the Retro-seq data (Extended Data Fig. 13b), 
290 
we also find sparse long-range projections from anterior VISp to anterior cingulate area (ACA, Fig. 5f, left 
291 
panel).  
292 
We define four related types (two per area) in L5/6 that express distinct markers including Tshz2, Slc17a8 
293 
and Rapgef3. Based on the Retro-seq dataset, they do not project to any of the assayed areas (Fig. 3c,e). To 
294 
evaluate this finding by anterograde tracing we used a newly generated Cre line, Slc17a8-IRES2-Cre. 
295 
Anterograde tracing of neurons labeled by this line revealed no long-range projections, except for a few 
296 
axons in neighboring areas (Fig. 5g). Therefore, we name this subclass “near-projecting” (NP). Some of 
297 
these cells likely correspond to previously reported Slc17a8+ L5 cells, whose projections could not be 
298 
established by retrograde labeling (Sorensen et al., 2015), as well as cells labeled by Efr3a-Cre_NO108 
299 
(Kim et al., 2015). Although Efr3a mRNA is ubiquitously detected in all neurons, its expression is about 
300 
5-fold higher in NP types compared to others (Fig. 4b); this may contribute to preferential labeling of the 
301 
NP types by this BAC transgenic Cre line.  
302 
We confirmed the spatial locations of the transcriptomic types in VISp by single-molecule FISH with class- 
303 
or type-specific marker genes as probes (Fig. 4c-f). Our result (Fig. 4f) corroborates previous evidence 
304 
showing that L5 IT and L5 PT cells are not clearly separated into 5a and 5b sublayers in the visual cortex 
305 
in contrast to their sublayer-specific segregation in the primary somatosensory cortex (Groh et al., 2010).

Cell types: area-specific divergences 
308 
To assess differences in the number of differentially expressed genes between most closely-related types, 
309 
we used the best match between types for excitatory types (Fig. 6a,b) and, as a comparison, we split the 
310 
inhibitory clusters into their area-specific (ALM- and VISp-) portions. We then performed differential gene 
311 
expression search to count the number of differentially expressed genes between these best-matched pairs. 
312 
We find that inhibitory neurons from the two areas belonging to the same cluster have at most 12 
313 
differentially expressed genes, while the best matched excitatory types between VISp and ALM have a 
314 
median of 100 differentially expressed genes (Fig. 6a, Extended Data Table 3).  
315 
The method of defining the best match among excitatory types between the two areas (Fig. 6b), revealed 
316 
additional patterns. Regardless of the direction of mapping (VISp cells onto ALM types or vice versa), very 
317 
few one-to-one correspondences between types were observed. Several-to-several mappings dominate, but 
318 
are almost completely confined to each major branch (subclass), confirming similarity at higher hierarchical 
319 
level between ALM and VISp types. We identify a large set of genes with differential enrichment in these 
320 
two areas, further highlighting substantial inter-areal differences in excitatory cell populations (Fig. 6c). 
321 
Interestingly, we find more ALM-enriched genes. We confirm the area-specific expression of several genes 
322 
by RNA ISH from the Allen Brain Atlas (Fig. 6e).  
323 
We also construct a constellation diagram for excitatory types from both areas (Fig. 6d), revealing similar 
324 
correspondences to the mapping in Fig. 6b: correspondence is based both on layer and projectional type, 
325 
and there are no intermediate cells that connect types from non-adjacent layers.  
326 
Inhibitory neurons belonging to the same cluster and segregated by area display at most 12 differentially 
327 
expressed genes (Fig. 6a). Using t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), we observe more 
328 
pronounced segregation of cells by region for Sst/Pvalb types compared to Vip/Lamp5 types (Fig. 7a,b), 
329 
with both being substantially lower than segregation observed for glutamatergic types (Fig. 7c). An 
330 
example of regional expression differences within the Sst Etv1_3 and Sst_Crhr2_1 clusters (Fig. 7d) was 
331 
observed for Crh and Calb2 genes. These genes are co-expressed in some cells in Sst Etv1_3 type only in 
332 
ALM, and in Sst Crhr2_1 type only in VISp (Fig. 7e). We examined this finding by single-molecule RNA 
333 
FISH using probes against Sst, Calb2, and Crh (Fig. 7f,g). As predicted by cell type identity and cell type 
334 
distribution, we find triple positive cells by RNA FISH in ALM only in upper layers, likely belonging to 
335 
Sst Etv1_3 type (Fig. 7e,f). In contrast, the triple positive cells in VISp are only found in lower layers, 
336 
likely corresponding to Sst Crhr2_1 (Fig. 7e,g). 
337 
 
338 
DISCUSSION 
339 
We use single-cell transcriptomics to uncover principles of cell type diversity in the neocortex and their 
340 
variation across functionally distinct areas. By employing a variety of recombinase driver lines, we 
341 
achieved both broad coverage and enrichment for rare or fragile cell types to define a near-complete 
342 
repertoire of transcriptomic cell types in two functionally distinct cortical areas, VISp and ALM. By 
343 
combining retrograde labeling from multiple VISp and ALM output areas, we defined correspondence 
344 
between transcriptomic identity and neuronal projection properties. The transcriptomic types were 
345 
organized in a hierarchical taxonomy through unsupervised clustering analyses, and fell into major branches 
346 
(cell classes) and terminal leaves (cell types) that are either novel or correspond to known cell classes/types. 
347 
Consequently, this dataset provides comprehensive gene expression profiles and genetic markers for these 
348 
novel and existing cell classes/types that will enable genetic access to them for future studies from 
349 
molecular to functional levels.

We define 116 transcriptomic types, 86 types in ALM and 97 in VISP, 67 of which are shared between the 
351 
two areas. The shared types are non-neuronal and inhibitory neuronal types, whereas most excitatory types 
352 
are area-specific (exceptions are the CR cells and two L6b types). Although previous studies reported 
353 
similarities of neocortical and hippocampal interneurons, as well as non-neuronal cells (Zeisel et al., 2015), 
354 
we report this finding with a more sensitive technique including substantially higher gene detection. In fact, 
355 
we find statistically significant gene expression differences between ALM and VISp portions of many 
356 
interneuron clusters (Figs. 6a and 7); however these differences are still insufficient to cause cluster 
357 
separation into VISp- and ALM-specific interneuron subtypes with our statistical criteria (Methods). In 
358 
contrast, we readily detect a large number of genes that distinguish each pair of matched excitatory types 
359 
across these two cortical areas (Fig. 6a). 
360 
This dichotomy correlates well with area-specific connectivity patterns as well as the cells’ developmental 
361 
origins. Most excitatory neuronal types in VISp or ALM project to different cortical and subcortical target 
362 
areas (Fig. 5, Extended Data Fig. 13), forming unique circuits involved in distinct neural coding processes. 
363 
In contrast, nearly all inhibitory interneurons form local connections with nearby excitatory or inhibitory 
364 
neurons, and play mostly modulatory functions within the local circuits. Although the inhibitory types are 
365 
shared between areas, their area-specific functions may be achieved through the variations in cell type 
366 
abundances across areas (Kim et al., 2017).  
367 
The developmental origins of these different neuronal types correlate with their uniqueness or commonality. 
368 
It has been shown that most excitatory neurons are born locally within the ventricular/subventricular zone 
369 
(Gao et al., 2014) that is pre-patterned with developmental gradients (O'Leary et al., 2007) and further 
370 
segregated into areas through differential thalamic input early in development (Chou et al., 2013; Moreno-
371 
Juan et al., 2017; Vue et al., 2013). In contrast, GABAergic interneurons are MGE- and CGE-derived, 
372 
Meis2 interneurons originate from the palial-subpalial boundary (Frazer et al., 2017), and Cajal-Retzius 
373 
cells originate from the cortical hem (Yoshida et al., 2006). Similarly, we wonder if the two L6b types that 
374 
are shared across areas correspond to a subset of subplate neurons that originate from the rostro-medial 
375 
telencephalic wall, which is a known embryonic source for a subset of subplate neurons that are distinct 
376 
from other subplate neurons generated within the local ventricular/subventricular zone (Hoerder-
377 
Suabedissen and Molnar, 2015; Pedraza et al., 2014). 
378 
We observe both discontinuous and continuous gene expression variation among and within cell types. 
379 
Continuous variation poses a challenge to cell type categorization, as clustering methods are designed to 
380 
rely on discontinuous variation. We therefore used post-clustering classifiers and constellation diagrams to 
381 
describe both types of variation within the cell type landscape. These landscapes may evolve as the 
382 
perceived vs. actual discreteness (or discreteness vs. continuity) in cell type definition depend on gene 
383 
detection, cell sampling and noise estimates (Tasic et al., 2017). For example, in this study, we detect a 
384 
continuum of phenotypes within the L4-Rspo1 type that corresponds to three highly related previous types 
385 
(L4 Ctxn3, L4 Scnn1a, and L4 Arf5), which were connected by many intermediate cells (Extended Data 
386 
Table 2, Extended Data Fig. 15) (Tasic et al., 2016). Therefore, heterogeneity is still present, but its 
387 
description changed from discrete to continuous.  
388 
The hierarchical organization of cell types captures the adult similarity in gene expression with high-level 
389 
branches representing major, distinct cell classes and finer branches representing more closely related types. 
390 
In many cases, it also represents developmental, and potentially evolutionary ontology of cell types. 
391 
However, this does not necessarily have to be the case for every type – developmental origins need to be 
392 
experimentally established. For example, we find that Nkx2.1-CreERT2 labels not only chandelier cells but 
393 
also a type that was presumed to be a second chandelier type – CHC2 (Paul et al., 2017). However, we find 
394 
that based on its transcriptomic signatures, CHC2 is likely a neurogliaform type (Lamp5-Lxh6). The

embryonic origin of this potential MGE-derived type would still have to be tested by lineage tracing, but it 
396 
is not unreasonable to consider that the neurogliaform phenotype could arise through two different 
397 
developmental pathways in an example of developmental convergence. For example, in C. elegans, 
398 
morphologically and connectionally highly similar bilateral neuronal pairs are derived from different 
399 
lineages (Hobert, 2014).  
400 
Our current hierarchical cortical cell type taxonomy is largely based on transcriptomic information that is 
401 
overlaid with projectional properties. In the future, it will be important to correlate transcriptomic 
402 
information with morphological, physiological, connectional, and functional properties of individual cells 
403 
to define which transcriptomic features correspond to other phenotypes. As a particularly compelling 
404 
example, we show that L5 pyramidal tract (PT) transcriptomic clusters correspond to neuronal types with 
405 
distinct projection patterns and different functions (Economo et al., 2017, accompanying paper). We expect 
406 
that as new data become available, the cell type taxonomy will be further refined. This dataset provides a 
407 
foundation for understanding cortical cell type diversity and dissecting circuit function.

Figure 1. Cell type taxonomy in ALM and VISp cortical areas. (a) Cells were collected from the anterior 
434 
lateral motor cortex (ALM) and primary visual cortex (VISp). For both areas, a combination of 
435 
transgenically labeled cells and retrogradely labeled cells was used for scRNA-seq, in combination with 
436 
layer-enriching or all-layer microdissections. (b) After dissection, samples were treated with a protease and 
437 
triturated to generate a single-cell suspension. Individual cells were isolated by FACS or manual sorting, 
438 
processed for reverse transcription (RT) and cDNA amplification (cDNA amp.) using SMART-Seq v4, 
439 
followed by tagmentation and indexing. Indexed samples were then pooled for next-generation sequencing 
440 
(NGS). (c) 50 GABAergic, 52 glutamatergic, and 14 non-neuronal types are organized into a hierarchical 
441 
taxonomy on the basis of median cluster gene expression of 4,015 differentially expressed genes and 21,749 
442 
cells (12,714 from VISp, 9,035 from ALM). Hierarchical clustering was performed 100 times using 
443 
multiscale bootstrap resampling to generate confidence scores for each branch point in the dendrogram 
444 
(Methods). Dendrogram branches are colored based on their confidence scores (white = 0 to black = 1), 
445 
and are thicker if the confidence score p-value < 0.05. Cell classes are labeled with colored dots at branch 
446 
points in the dendrogram. The bar plots from left to right represent: the fraction of cells dissected from 
447 
ALM (black) and VISp (bluegray); the fraction of cells from each of the layer-enriching dissections (lighter 
448 
= upper layers, darker = lower layers; tan = all layers); and the number of cells contributing to each cell 
449 
type in cluster-specific colors used throughout the paper.

Figure 2. GABAergic cell types by scRNA-seq. (a,b) Constellation diagrams for Sst/Pvalb and 
452 
Lamp5/Sncg/Vip types. Core cells (N = 8,040) are represented by discs, and intermediate cells (N = 1,259) 
453 
by lines. Intermediate cells connecting different classes (e.g., Sst and Pvalb) are labeled pink. No 
454 
intermediate cells exist between Sst/Pvalb and Lamp5/Sncg/Vip classes. (c,d) Dendrograms represent 
455 
overall gene expression similarity between types based on median gene expression in each cell type for 
456 
differentially expressed marker genes (as in Fig. 1). Below the dendrograms, spatial distribution of each 
457 
type was inferred from layer-enriching dissections: each dot represents a single cell from a layer-enriching 
458 
dissection, dots are positioned at random within each layer. (e,f) Marker gene expression distributions in 
459 
single cells within each cluster are represented by violin plots. Each row represents a single gene, and values 
460 
within rows are normalized between 0 and the maximum expression value for each gene (shown at the right 
461 
edge of each row) and displayed on a log10 scale. Median values are shown as black points within each 
462 
violin.

Figure 3. Glutamatergic cell types by scRNA-seq and projections. (a) For each retrograde tracing 
465 
experiment, a virus was injected into a target site. 7-14 days after injection, brains were sectioned, and the 
466 
injection site was imaged to determine injection specificity. Cells were collected from the collection site 
467 
(ALM or VISp) by microdissection, tissue was dissociated and single cells sorted by FACS or manually. 
468 
(b) Injection targets are grouped into target regions: Cortex (CTX), Striatum (STR), Thalamus (TH), 
469 
Tectum (TEC), Pons (P), or Medulla (MY). More details about injections are available in Extended Data 
470 
Fig. 13. (c) Dendrogram representing all excitatory cell types in ALM followed by numbers of cells 
471 
(represented by discs) originating from retrograde labeling by injections into regions labeled on top. Shaded 
472 
regions denote cells that may have been labeled unintentionally, directly or retrogradely, through the needle 
473 
(injection) tract. (d) Constellation diagram for all cells from ALM glutamatergic cell types. Disc area 
474 
represents the total number of core cells assigned to each clusters, and edge weights represent the number 
475 
of intermediate cells. (e) Same as (c), but for VISp. VISp cells were not collected from injections into 
476 
medulla (MY). (f) Same as (d), but for VISp. *, L6b-P2ry12 and L6b-Mup3 types are found in both ALM 
477 
and VISp.

Figure 4. Glutamatergic cell types and markers. (a) A dendrogram representing taxonomy of 51 
480 
glutamatergic clusters based on 11,377 total cells and median gene expression of 1,289 genes per cluster. 
481 
Below, cells from layer-enriching dissections that belong to these types are represented as dots (randomly 
482 
within each layer). ALM does not contain L4 (indicated by hashed rectangles). (b) Violin plots represent 
483 
distributions of individual marker gene expression in single cells within each cluster. Rows are genes, 
484 
median values are black dots, and values within rows are normalized between 0 and the maximum 
485 
expression value for each gene (right edge of each row) and displayed on a log10 scale. (c) Single molecule 
486 
fluorescence RNA in situ hybridization with RNAscope to validate marker expression and cell type 
487 
distribution. Example image shows fluorescent spots that correspond to Rspo1, Hsd11b1, and Scnn1a 
488 
mRNA molecules in a 10-µm coronal VISp section. Scale bars are in µm. (d) Example of processed 
489 
RNAscope data obtained by generating a maximum projection of a montage of confocal z-stacks, 
490 
identifying nuclei, quantifying the number of fluorescent spots, and assigning spots to each nucleus by 
491 
CellProfiler (Lamprecht et al., 2007). Each dot in the panel represents a cell in the same VISp region as in 
492 
c, plotted according to the detected nucleus position. The first three panels show cells shaded according to 
493 
the quantified number of spots per cell: Rspo1 and Scnn1a mRNAs are enriched in L4 and Hsd11b1 at the 
494 
L4/5 border. The fourth panel shows location of cells co-labeled with two or more probes and confirms 
495 
scRNA-seq data: coexpression of Rspo1 and Scnn1a is expected in VISp L4-Rspo1 type and coexpression 
496 
of Hsd11b1 and Scnn1a in VISp L5-Endou type (see a,b). The green square in (d) corresponds to white 
497 
square in (c). The fifth panel in (d) is a condensed plot created to emphasize layer enrichment of examined 
498 
cells. (e) Condensed plots for RNA scope experiments (Exp) in VISp for select excitatory cell type markers. 
499 
Layers were delineated based on cell density. (f) A schematic of laminar distributions of VISp glutamatergic 
500 
types according to experiments in (e).

Figure 5. Anterograde tracing reveals area- and layer-specific cortico-cortical projections of 
503 
transcriptomic types. (a) Anterograde tracing workflow: Cre-dependent adeno-associated virus (AAV) 
504 
was injected into VISp or ALM in different Cre-driver mice. 3 weeks post-injection, the brains were imaged 
505 
by the TissueCyte 1000 system, the image datasets were registered to Allen Mouse Common Coordinate 
506 
Framework (CCF), and the GFP fluorescent signals were segmented to reveal GFP-labeled axon fibers 
507 
throughout the entire brain (Oh et al., 2014). (b-g) Left and right panels represent injections into VISp and 
508 
ALM, respectively, for (b) Cux2-IRES-Cre; (c) Tlx3-Cre_PL56; (d) Penk-IRES2-Cre-neo; (f) Ctgf-T2A-
509 
dgCre; and (g) Slc17a8-IRES2-Cre animals. (e) Left and right panels represent two different injection 
510 
locations within VISp for Nr5a1-Cre animals. Top image is top-down view of segmented GFP signals 
511 
throughout the cortex, bottom-left image is a raw fluorescent image of the injection site; middle and right 
512 
images are segmented GFP signals from representative projection target areas in contralateral (labeled with

METHODS 
860 
Mouse breeding and husbandry. All procedures were carried out in accordance with Institutional Animal 
861 
Care and Use Committee protocols 1508, 1510, and 1511 at the Allen Institute for Brain Science. Animals 
862 
were provided food and water ad libitum and were maintained on a regular 12-h day/night cycle at no more 
863 
than five adult animals per cage. Animals were maintained on the C57BL/6J background, and newly 
864 
received or generated transgenic lines were backcrossed to C57BL/6J. Experimental animals were 
865 
heterozygous for the recombinase transgenes and the reporter transgenes. Transgenic lines used in this study 
866 
are summarized in Extended Data Table 5. Standard tamoxifen treatment for CreER lines included a single 
867 
dose of tamoxifen (40 μl of 50 mg ml−1) dissolved in corn oil and administered via oral gavage at postnatal 
868 
day (P)10–14. Tamoxifen treatment for Nkx2.1-CreERT2;Ai14 was performed at embryonic day (E)17 (oral 
869 
gavage of the dam at 1 mg per 10 g of body weight), pups were delivered by cesarean section at E19 and 
870 
then fostered. Cux2-CreERT2;Ai14 mice received tamoxifen treatment at P35 ± 5 for five consecutive days. 
871 
Trimethoprim was administered to animals containing Ctgf-2A-dgCre by oral gavage at P40 ± 5 for three 
872 
consecutive days (0.015 ml per g of body weight using 20 mg ml−1 trimethoprim solution). Ndnf-IRES2-
873 
dgCre animals did not receive trimethoprim induction, since the baseline dgCre activity (without 
874 
trimethoprim) was sufficient to label the cells with the Ai14 reporter (Tasic et al., 2016). We excluded any 
875 
animals with anophthalmia or microphthalmia. 
876 
Generation of transgenic mice (Penk-IRES2-Cre-neo, Slc17a8-IRES2-Cre, Vipr2-IRES2-Cre). Vectors 
877 
containing gene-specific homology arms and IRES2-Cre-bGHpoly(A)-PGK-gb2-NEO-PGKpoly(A) 
878 
components were generated using gene synthesis (GenScript) and standard molecular cloning techniques. 
879 
Targeting of the transgene cassette into the endogenous gene locus immediately downstream of the stop 
880 
codon was accomplished by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing using circularized targeting vector in 
881 
combination with a gene-specific guide vector (Addgene plasmid #42230). The 129S6/B6 F1 ES cell line, 
882 
G4 (George et al., 2007), was used to generate all modified ES cells. Correctly targeted clones were 
883 
identified using standard screening approaches (PCR, qPCR and Southern blots) and injected into 
884 
blastocysts to obtain chimeras and subsequent germline transmission. Resulting mice were crossed to the 
885 
Rosa26-PhiC31o mice (JAX Stock # 007743)(Raymond and Soriano, 2007) to delete the PGK-NEO 
886 
selection cassette, and then backcrossed to C57BL/6J mice and maintained in the C57BL/6J background. 
887 
The PGK-NEO cassette could not be removed from Penk-IRES2-Cre-neo by PhiC31o-mediated 
888 
recombination. 
889 
Stereotaxic injections. Retrograde Labeling. We injected AAV2-retro-EF1a-Cre (Tervo et al., 2016), 
890 
SADB-rabies-dGdL-Cre, or CAV-Cre (gift of Miguel Chillon Rodrigues, Universitat Autònoma de 
891 
Barcelona) (Hnasko et al., 2006) into brains of heterozygous or homozygous Ai14 mice as previously 
892 
described (Tasic et al., 2016). For ALM experiments, we also injected AAV2-retro-CAG-GFP or AAV2-
893 
retro-CAG-tdTomato (Tervo et al., 2016) into wild-type mice. Stereotaxic coordinates were obtained from 
894 
Paxinos adult mouse brain atlas (Franklin, 2008)(Extended Data Table 4). For two VISp experiments, we 
895 
injected into SCs by inserting the needle through the cerebellum at a 45°-angle in the posterior to anterior 
896 
direction. TdT+ or GFP+ single cells were isolated from VISp or ALM, depending on the injection area. 
897 
Anterograde labeling. For anterograde projection mapping, we injected AAV2/1-pCAG-FLEX-EGFP-
898 
WPRE-pA (Oh et al., 2014) into VISp or ALM of 8-12 weeks old mice. The stereotaxic injection procedure 
899 
was the same as described for retrograde labeling above. In Ctgf-T2A-dgCre mice, TMP induction was 
900 
conducted 1 week after AAV injection for 3 consecutive days. Mice were sacrificed and brains perfused 
901 
after 21 days (or 28 days in the case of Ctgf-T2A-dgCre) after AAV injection, and brains were imaged using 
902 
TissueCyte 1000 system as described previously (Oh et al., 2014). Experiments can be viewed interactively

Single-cell isolation. We isolated single cells as previously described (Hempel et al., 2007; Sugino et al., 
905 
2006; Tasic et al., 2016) with modifications below. We mostly employed layer-enriching dissections, with 
906 
focus on a single layer. Broader dissections (no layer enrichment or multiple layers combined) were 
907 
employed for lines which label small numbers of cells, in order to facilitate isolation of sufficient number 
908 
of cells. We updated our ACSF formulation to consist of CaCl2 (0.5 mM), glucose (25 mM), HCl (96 mM), 
909 
HEPES (20 mM), MgSO4 (10 mM), NaH2PO4 (1.25 mM), myo-inositol (3 mM), N-acetylcysteine (12 mM), 
910 
NMDG (96 mM), KCl (2.5 mM), NaHCO3 (25 mM), sodium L-ascorbate (5 mM), sodium pyruvate (3 
911 
mM), taurine (0.01 mM), thiourea (2 mM), and bubbled with carbogen gas (95% O2 and 5% CO2). For 
912 
samples collected after 12/16/2016, the ACSF formulation also included trehalose (13.2 mM). Mice were 
913 
anesthetized with isoflurane and perfused with cold carbogen-bubbled ACSF. The brain was dissected, 
914 
submerged in ACSF, embedded in 2% agarose, and sliced into 250-µm coronal sections on a compresstome 
915 
(Precisionary). Enzymatic digestion, trituration into single cell suspension, and fluorescence-activated cell 
916 
sorting (FACS) of single cells were carried out as previously described (Tasic et al., 2016). Cells were 
917 
sorted into 8-well strips containing lysis buffer from SMART-Seq v4 kit (see below) with RNase inhibitor 
918 
(0.17 U/µl), immediately frozen on dry ice, and stored at -80°C. 
919 
cDNA amplification and library construction. We used the SMART-Seq v4 Ultra Low Input RNA Kit 
920 
for Sequencing (Takara Cat#634894) to reverse transcribe poly(A) RNA and amplify cDNA according to 
921 
the manufacturer’s instructions. We performed reverse transcription and cDNA amplification for 18 PCR 
922 
cycles in 8-well strips, in sets of 12-24 strips at a time. At least 1 control strip was used per amplification 
923 
set, which contained 4 wells without cells and 4 wells with 10 pg control RNA. Control RNA was either 
924 
Mouse Whole Brain Total RNA (Zyagen, MR-201) or control RNA provided in the SMART-Seq v4 kit. 
925 
All samples proceeded through NexteraXT DNA Library Preparation (Illumina FC-131-1096) using 
926 
NexteraXT Index Kit V2 Set A (FC-131-2001). NexteraXT DNA Library prep was performed according 
927 
to manufactorer’s instructions except that the volumes of all reagents including cDNA input were decreased 
928 
to 0.4× or 0.5× by volume. Details are available in Documentation on the Allen Institute data portal at: 
929 
http://celltypes.brain-map.org/.  
930 
Sequencing data processing and QC. 50-base pair paired-end reads were aligned to GRCm38 (mm10) 
931 
using 
a 
RefSeq 
annotation 
gff 
file 
retrieved 
from 
NCBI 
on 
01/18/2016 
932 
(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/annotation_euk/all/). Sequence alignment was performed using 
933 
STAR v2.5.3 (Dobin et al., 2013) in twopassMode. PCR duplicates were masked and removed using STAR 
934 
option “bamRemoveDuplicates”. Only uniquely aligned reads were used for gene quantification. Gene 
935 
counts were computed using the R GenomicAlignments package (Lawrence et al., 2013) sumarizeOverlaps 
936 
function using “IntersectionNotEmpty”. Cells with fewer than 2,000 detected genes (count > 0) and less 
937 
than 30% of reads mapped to the transcriptome were removed. Doublets were removed by first classifying 
938 
cells into broad classes of excitatory, inhibitory, and non-neuronal based on known markers. For each class, 
939 
we selected highly specific genes that are only present in this class against all other classes, and computed 
940 
the eigengene (the first principle component based on the given gene set). Eigengenes for all classes were 
941 
normalized in the range of 0 and 1, and we removed any cells that scored > 0.2 in more than one class.  
942 
Mapping reads to synthetic constructs. We mapped all non-genome-mapped reads to sequences in 
943 
Extended Data Table 6. To avoid ambiguous counting due to stretches of sequence identity, we designated 
944 
unique regions within these sequences to count mRNAs of interest. We counted only reads for which at 
945 
least one of the paired ends had an overlap with the unique regions of at least 10 bp.  
946 
Clustering. Cells that passed QC criteria were clustered using an in-house developed iterative clustering R 
947 
package iclust, described partially in previous studies (Tasic et al., 2016; Yao et al., 2017), with new 
948 
adaptions for large number of cells and improved robustness (this package will be available on Github). In 
949 
brief, cells were grouped into very broad categories using known markers, then clustered using high

variance gene selection, dimensionality reduction, dimension filtering, and Jaccard-Louvain or hierarchical 
951 
(Ward) clustering. This process was repeated within each resulting cluster until no more child clusters met 
952 
differential gene expression or cluster size termination criteria. The entire clustering procedure was repeated 
953 
100 times using 80% of all cells sampled at random, and the frequency with which cells co-cluster was used 
954 
to generate a final set of clusters, again subject to differential gene expression and cluster size termination 
955 
criteria. A workflow diagram for this approach is presented in Extended Data Fig. 2. Below, we provide 
956 
more details for the analysis carried out at each iteration of clustering: 
957 
1. Selection of high variance genes. We first removed predicted gene models (gene names that start 
958 
with Gm), genes from the mitochondrial chromosome, and ribosomal genes, as well as genes that 
959 
are detected in fewer than 4 cells. To choose high variance genes, we used gene counts from each 
960 
cell to fit a Loess regression curve between average scaled gene counts and dispersion (variance 
961 
divided by mean). The regression residuals were then fit to a normal distribution based on 25% and 
962 
75% quantiles to calculate p-values and adjusted p-values (using Holm’s method), representing the 
963 
probability that each gene had higher than expected variance. Genes were ranked by p-value, and 
964 
the top 4,000 genes were used for dimensionality reduction.  
965 
2. Dimensionality reduction. The 4,000 most variable genes selected in Step 1 above were used as 
966 
input for WGCNA to identify gene modules. To determine the discriminative power of each 
967 
module, we used the genes in each module to cluster the cells into two clusters using Jaccard-
968 
Louvain clustering (for > 4,000 cells, (Shekhar et al., 2016)) or a combination of K-means and 
969 
Ward’s hierarchical clustering (for < 4,000 cells). After dividing the cells into two clusters, we 
970 
computed differential gene expression between the two clusters using the limma package for R 
971 
(Ritchie et al., 2015). Differential expression (DE) gene analysis used all expressed genes, not just 
972 
module-associated genes. We then computed the deScore (differential expression score), defined 
973 
as the sum of −log10(adjusted P-value) of all DE genes. For deScore calculations, the maximum 
974 
value each gene was allowed to contribute was 20. Only modules with deScore greater than 150 
975 
were selected for use in downstream analysis, and module eigengenes were computed for selected 
976 
modules as reduced dimensions.  
977 
3. Dimension filtering. In previous studies (Tasic et al., 2016; Yao et al., 2017), we curated a list of 
978 
gene modules that corresponded to technical biases, such the genes correlated with number of 
979 
detected genes or % of reads mapping to mRNA, genes correlated with sequencing batch, and sex 
980 
specific genes, which we would like to mask in downstream analysis. We computed module 
981 
eigengenes for these technical bias modules, then computed the correlation between the reduced 
982 
dimensions from Step 2. We removed dimensions with maximum Pearson correlation with any 
983 
technical bias module greater than 0.7.  
984 
4. Initial clustering. For clustering, we applied either the Jaccard-Louvain method (Shekhar et al., 
985 
2016) (for > 4,000 cells), or Ward’s method (for <= 4,000 cells). The Jaccard-Louvain algorithm 
986 
was applied by computing k-nearest-neighbors (k = 15) for each cell, then constructing a cell-cell 
987 
similarity matrix using a Jaccard index based on the number of shared neighbors between every 
988 
pair of cells. Jaccard similarity index was then used for clustering using the Louvain algorithm. 
989 
This algorithm scales very well with large data sets, but has been proven to have resolution limit 
990 
(Fortunato and Barthelemy, 2007), and small clusters tend to be missed. Therefore, as a 
991 
complementary approach, we applied Ward’s minimum variance method for hierarchical clustering 
992 
when fewer than 4000 cells were to be clustered. The initial number of clusters was set at twice the 
993 
number of reduced dimensions from step 3.  
994 
5. Cluster merging. To make sure the resulting clusters all have distinguishable transcriptomic 
995 
signatures, we defined DE genes between every cluster and their top two nearest neighbors in the 
996 
reduced dimension space (using Euclidean distance if there were 1 or 2 dimensions, or 1 minus

Pearson correlation for more dimensions). A pair of clusters was considered separable if the 
998 
deScore (described in Step 2) for all DE genes was greater than 150. If a cluster did not pass this 
999 
criterion, it was merged with the nearest cluster, then nearest neighbor and DE gene scores were 
1000 
recomputed using the merged clusters. Clusters with fewer than 4 cells were also merged with their 
1001 
nearest neighbors. This iterative merging process was repeated until all remaining clusters were 
1002 
separable, and have minimal cluster size.  
1003 
Steps 1-5 were repeated for each resulting cluster until no further partitions were found. 
1004 
6. Defining consensus clusters. To determine the robustness of the clustering results, the entire 
1005 
clustering procedure was repeated 100 times using 80% of all cells sampled at random to generate 
1006 
the frequency matrix for every pair of cells to co-cluster. We inferred the consensus clusters by 
1007 
iteratively splitting the co-clustering matrix. In any given step, we used co-clustering matrix as the 
1008 
similarity matrix and clustered using either Louvain (>= 4000 cells) or Ward’s algorithm (< 4000 
1009 
cells). We defined 𝑁k,l as the average probabilities of cells within cluster 𝑘 to co-cluster with cells 
1010 
within cluster 𝑙. We merged clusters 𝑘, 𝑙 if 𝑁k,l > max(𝑁k,k, 𝑁l,l) –  0.25. We merged remaining 
1011 
clusters based on DE genes as described in step 5 using deScore threshold of 150. We noticed that 
1012 
for some closely related clusters, DE genes were expressed only in one cluster, but not the other. 
1013 
We merged pairs of clusters that had a deScore less than 50 in either direction.  
1014 
7. Cluster Refinement. For each cell 𝑖, we computed the average probability that it co-clusters with 
1015 
cells in each cluster 𝑘 as 𝑀i,k, and we reassigned every cell 𝑖 to the cluster 𝑘 with maximum 𝑀i,k. 
1016 
We repeated this process until convergence.  
1017 
8. Exclusion of outlier clusters. After defining consensus clusters, we examined our clustering 
1018 
results to identify outlier clusters that are likely to be due technical problems.  
1019 
Assigning core and intermediate cells. In our previous study, we applied a random forest classifier to 
1020 
confirm our cluster assignments, and to define core and intermediate cells (Tasic et al., 2016). We found 
1021 
that random forest classification penalized small clusters, so we used a nearest-centroid classifier, which 
1022 
assigns a cell to the cluster whose centroid is the closest (with the highest correlation) to the cell. Here, the 
1023 
cluster centroid is defined as the median expression of 4015 differential cell type markers. To define core 
1024 
vs. intermediate cells, we performed 5-fold cross-validation 100 times: in each round, the cells were 
1025 
randomly partitioned into 5 groups, and cells in each group of 20% of the cells were classified by a nearest-
1026 
centroid classifier trained using the other 80% of the cells. A cell classified to the same cluster more than 
1027 
90 times was defined as a core cell, the others were designated intermediate cells. We define 19,195 core 
1028 
cells and 2,554 intermediate cells, which in most cases classify to only 2 clusters (2,542 out of 2,554; 
1029 
99.5%). 
1030 
Correspondence between VISp and ALM excitatory clusters: To establish correspondence in both 
1031 
directions, we classified VISp excitatory cells using ALM clusters as training data, as well as, classified 
1032 
ALM excitatory cells using VISp clusters as training data. In both cases, we trained the nearest centroid 
1033 
classifier based on the common set of excitatory markers (pool of top 50 DE genes in each direction between 
1034 
excitatory clusters within VISp and ALM, respectively) shared by both regions, and calculated the fraction 
1035 
of cells in each VISp clusters that mapped to each of the ALM clusters, and vice versa. For each cell, we 
1036 
computed the correlation score of the best mapping cluster, and transformed the correlation scores into Z 
1037 
scores. If the average Z score of cells from one cluster mapped to another cluster in the other region was 
1038 
below -1.64 (roughly 5% confidence interval), this cluster was considered to be unique to one region, with 
1039 
no corresponding cluster in the other region.  
1040 
Assessing correspondence to Paul 2017 dataset. We mapped cells from Paul 2017 dataset to our 
1041 
GABAergic clusters using the nearest centroid classifier based on inhibitory markers from the current 
1042 
dataset that were also detected in Paul 2017 dataset (expression >0). To take into account major differences

in profiling platforms we repeat classification 100 times, each time using 80% of randomly sampled 
1044 
markers, and computed the probabilities for every cell to map to every reference cluster.  
1045 
Assessing correspondence to Cadwell 2016 Patch-seq dataset. We mapped cells from the ArrayExpress 
1046 
accession E-MTAB-4092 dataset (Cadwell et al., 2016) to our VISp clusters using the nearest centroid 
1047 
classifier based on 3,372 of 3,406 VISp markers that were also detected in the Cadwell dataset 
1048 
(expression >0). To account for differences in Patch-seq and benchmark dataset (based on FACS-isolated 
1049 
cells) data quality, we repeated classifications 100 times, each time using 80% of randomly sampled 
1050 
markers, and computed the fraction of times every cell mapped to every reference cluster. Cells mapped to 
1051 
clusters with probabilities < 80% were mapped to the parent nodes of the mapped clusters within the cell 
1052 
type hierarchy, until aggregated confidence at the parent node was > 80%.  
1053 
Defining differentially expressed genes. Differentially expressed (DE) genes were detected using the R 
1054 
package limma v3.30.13 (Ritchie et al., 2015) using log2(CPM+1) of expression values. DE genes were 
1055 
defined as genes with > 2-fold change and adjusted pvalue < 0.01. We also required DE genes to have a 
1056 
relatively bimodal expression pattern, expressed predominately in one cluster relative to the other. To do 
1057 
that, we computed 𝑃𝑖,𝑗 as the fraction of cells in cluster 𝑗 expressing gene 𝑖 with CPM ≥ 1, and required up-
1058 
regulated genes 𝑖 in cluster 𝑐1 relative to 𝑐2 to have 𝑃𝑖,𝑐1 > 0.4, and (𝑃𝑖,𝑐1 −  𝑃𝑖,𝑐2)/max 
((𝑃𝑖,𝑐1, 𝑃
𝑖,𝑐2) >
1059 
 0.7. Due to significant computation overhead, we only used the “voom” mode, which increases the 
1060 
accuracy of limma on RNA-seq datasets, to calculate DE genes for the final clusters, and utilized limma’s 
1061 
default mode for cluster merging steps (Steps 5 and 6, above). 
1062 
Measures of heterogeneity within VISp-L4-Rspo1 and between VISp-L4-Rspo1 and related clusters. 
1063 
To explore the heterogeneity of the VISp-L4-Rspo1 cluster, which corresponds to three separate cell types 
1064 
in our previous study ((Tasic et al., 2016) and Extended Data Fig. 7), we first removed the QC-dependent 
1065 
gene expression signatures by regressing the expression of each gene against the QC index, defined as the 
1066 
ratio of the fraction of the reads mapped to non-exonic regions over reads mapped to exonic regions. This 
1067 
QC-dependent signature is particularly high for L4 cells, and is confounded with other transcriptomic 
1068 
signatures. After normalization, we performed WGCNA to find co-expressed gene modules within cells 
1069 
from VISp-L4-Rspo1. We found that the eigengene for the top gene module within VISp L4 Rspo1 
1070 
corresponds to the gradient that drove separation of L4 subtypes previously (Tasic et al., 2016). We then 
1071 
took the 50 cells that were most correlated with each end of the eigengene-defined gradient, and used their 
1072 
gene expression data to train a random forest classifier. The classification probabilities by random forest 
1073 
strongly correlated with the gradient eigengene (Extended Data Fig. 7e). The distribution of the 
1074 
classification probabilities was compared with a uniform distribution using a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test 
1075 
(KS test), which gave a modest p-value when used to test cells from within the VISp-L4-Rspo1 cluster 
1076 
(6.69×10-5). We repeated the same test between VISp-L4-Rspo1 and the neighboring VISp-L5-Endou 
1077 
cluster. The eigengene for this comparison was defined as the first principle component of the top 50 DE 
1078 
genes in both directions. In this case, the random forest classfication probabilities deviated from uniform 
1079 
distribution more significantly than when cells within VISp-L4-Rspo1 alone were used (KS Test p-value = 
1080 
2.9×10-9). When cells in the VISp-L4-Rspo1 cluster were compared with the more distant VISp-L5-Batf3 
1081 
cluster, the separation is clear: classification probabilities have a bimodal distribution. 
1082 
RNA FISH by RNAScope. We performed RNA FISH using RNAScope Multiplex Fluorescent v1 and v2 
1083 
kits (Advanced Cell Diagnostics, Newark, CA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. We used fresh 
1084 
frozen sections, which we prepared by dissecting fresh brains, embedding the brains in OCT, and storing 
1085 
OCT blocks at -80 °C. 10-µm coronal sections were cut using a cryostat and collected on SuperFrost slides. 
1086 
Sections were allowed to dry for 30 min at -20 °C in the cryostat chamber, placed into pre-chilled plastic 
1087 
slide boxes, wrapped in a zipped plastic bag, and stored at -80 °C. Slides were used within one week. Nuclei 
1088 
were labeled by DAPI and nuclear signal was used to segment cells in images. We imaged mounted sections 
1089
