Changes in the early-life microbiota of hosts might affect infectious disease risk throughout
life, if such disruptions during formative times alter immune system development. Here, we
test whether an early-life disruption of host-associated microbiota affects later-life resistance
to infections by manipulating the microbiota of tadpoles and challenging them with parasitic
gut worms as adults. We find that tadpole bacterial diversity is negatively correlated with
parasite establishment in adult frogs: adult frogs that had reduced bacterial diversity as
tadpoles have three times more worms than adults without their microbiota manipulated as
tadpoles. In contrast, adult bacterial diversity during parasite exposure is not correlated with
parasite establishment in adult frogs. Thus, in this experimental setup, an early-life disruption
of the microbiota has lasting reductions on host resistance to infections, which is possibly
mediated by its effects on immune system development. Our results support the idea that
preventing early-life disruption of host-associated microbiota might confer protection against
diseases later in life.

 A
disruption of the normal microbiota of hosts just before
parasite exposure has been shown to increase infection
risk1–5. For example, at parasite exposure, an experi-
mental reduction of bacterial diversity in mouse guts increased
Clostridium infections relative to mice with normal gut micro-
biota1. One mechanism by which the bacterial community can
protect their host from infections is through direct competition
with the parasite6, 7. In contrast to this direct effect, host-
associated
microbiota
may
indirectly
affect
infections
by
influencing the maintenance or development of the immune
system8–10.
Early-life disruption of host-associated microbiota might
increase, decrease, or have no effect on infection risk for hosts
later in life. For example, reductions in Bacteroides fragilis in the
gut of mice can adversely affect the development of the immune
system8, 9, suggesting increased infection risk. However, the
consequences of these lasting changes on actual infections remain
unclear; modifications to particular components of the immune
system may not be relevant for fighting all types of pathogens.
Conversely, studies show that an early-life disruption of host-
associated microbiota can result in a hyper-reactive immune
system that may increase the subsequent risk of immune-related,
non-infectious diseases, such as allergies and autoimmune dis-
eases (e.g., inflammatory bowel diseases)11, 12. In these cases, a
hyper-reactive immune system attacks either innocuous antigens
(i.e., allergens) or the host itself13, 14. Thus, an early-life disrup-
tion of the microbiota could also cause hyperimmunity to real
infectious agents, reducing both infection and disease risk.
In our study, we show that an early-life disruption of the gut
and skin bacterial communities of tadpoles affects later-life
resistance to parasitic gut worms in adult frogs. Specifically, we
show that tadpole bacterial diversity is negatively correlated with
parasite establishment in adult frogs. Adult frogs that have
reduced bacterial diversity as tadpoles have three times more
parasites than adults that did not have their microbiota
manipulated as tadpoles. In contrast, adult gut bacterial diversity
during parasite exposure is not correlated with parasite estab-
lishment in adult frogs. Our results suggest that preventing early-
life disruptions of host-associated bacterial communities might
reduce infection risk later in life.
Results
Experimental design and background. In this study, we inves-
tigated whether a disruption of the microbiota of hosts early in
life increases or decreases host resistance to infections later in life.
Here we define host resistance as defenses that reduce parasite
fitness. Specifically, we experimentally manipulated the micro-
biota of Cuban tree frog tadpoles (Osteopilus septentrionalis) and
then exposed them to parasites later in life. To manipulate the
tadpole microbiota, we reared tadpoles in either natural pond
water (control), autoclaved (i.e., sterile) pond water, sterile pond
water and short-term antibiotics, or sterile pond water and long-
term antibiotics (n = 20 tanks per treatment, four tadpoles per
tank) (see Methods for details). The autoclaved pond water
eliminated environmental sources of microbes, whereas the
antibiotic cocktail (short-term: 24-h exposure, long-term: 4-week
exposure) served to reduce the bacteria that had already colonized
the tadpoles. All tadpoles were fed sterilized spirulina and fish
flakes and all post-metamorphic frogs were housed individually in
containers with sterile Sphagnum sp. moss and fed non-sterile
crickets.
We used 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequencing to
characterize bacterial diversity and community composition of
both tadpoles (skin and gut) and adult frogs (gut; Fig. 1). We
present Faith’s phylogenetic diversity as our measure of alpha
diversity in the main text because it accounts for phylogenetic
differences among taxa. Results based on other alpha diversity
measurements were consistent with those based on phylogenetic
diversity (See Supplementary Table 1). For ease of interpretation,
we refer to tadpoles as juveniles and post-metamorphic frogs as
adults, but acknowledge that some of our post-metamorphic frogs
might have still been developing.
We also tested whether early- or later-life host microbiota best
predicted the ability of adult frogs to resist environmentally
common, skin-penetrating, gut worms Aplectana hamatospicula
(Ascaridida: Cosmocercidae; Fig. 1). A. hamatospicula has a direct
life cycle. Juvenile larvae penetrate the skin of frogs and then, in
approximately 3 weeks, establish, mature and reproduce in the
gastrointestinal (GI) tract15, 16. Worm eggs and larvae (they are
ovoviviparous) are defecated by frogs, and after approximately a
week of development, juvenile worms can infect the next host.
We quantified host resistance of adult frogs at both the skin
penetrating and gut establishment stages of the parasite, which
occurred 5 months after the microbiota of juveniles were
characterized (6 months after water treatments started). To
determine the relationships among water treatment, tadpole and
adult bacterial diversity, and adult resistance to parasitism, we
employed structural equation modeling (SEM). We used a
hypothetico-deductive
approach,
comparing
eight
a
priori
hypothesized path models based on Akaike information criterion
(AIC; Supplementary Fig. 1, Supplementary Table 2).
Effect of water treatment on host health. Water treatment sig-
nificantly affected juvenile survival (Coxme, χ2 = 16.69, df = 3,
P < 0.001; Supplementary Table 3 and time to metamorphosis
(GLMM, χ2 = 120.85, df = 3, P < 0.0001). Juveniles from the long-
term antibiotic treatment took twice as long to metamorphose
and had lower survival compared to juveniles from the control
treatment and other manipulated water treatments (sequential
Bonferroni post hoc multiple comparison test: P < 0.05 for long-
term antibiotic frogs compared to all other treatments). However,
mass at metamorphosis did not differ significantly among treat-
ments (GLMM, χ2 = 5.03, df = 3, P = 0.17). In contrast, juvenile
water treatment affected adult mass when measured 2 months
after metamorphosis (GLMM, χ2 = 19.44, df = 3, P < 0.001);
adults exposed to long-term antibiotics weighed less than frogs
from the control treatment and other manipulated water treat-
ments (P < 0.05 for long-term antibiotic frogs compared to all
other treatments). Water treatment did not have a lasting effect
on adult survival (Coxme, χ2 = 5.68, df = 3, P = 0.13).
Effect of water treatment on microbiota. Juveniles exposed to
sterile pond water or sterile water plus antibiotic treatments had
reduced gut and skin bacterial diversity (Fig. 2a and b; see Sup-
plementary Table 1 for other alpha diversity metrics) and altered
bacterial community membership (Fig. 2d and e) and structure
(gut: permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMA-
NOVA), F3,35 = 3.36, P = 0.001; skin: F3,37 = 2.10, P = 0.02) rela-
tive to juveniles exposed to non-sterile pond water. Specifically,
juvenile water treatment significantly reduced the relative abun-
dance of several phyla, such as Fusobacteria in the guts (χ2 =
18.82, df = 3, P < 0.001; Fig. 2d) and on the skin of juveniles (χ2
= 12.32, df = 3, P = 0.006; see Fig. 3 for all phyla). In contrast,
adult gut bacterial diversity (Fig. 2c, Supplementary Table 1) and
community membership (Fig. 2f) and structure (PERMANOVA
F3,76 = 1.42, P = 0.03) were similar across treatments with the
exception of adults exposed to sterile water with long-term
antibiotics as juveniles being different from the other three
treatments (Bonferroni post hoc multiple comparison test,
P < 0.01).

 Effect of water treatment on host resistance. Adult resistance to
worm penetration was not affected significantly by any of the
juvenile water treatments (Fig. 4a); however, frogs exposed to any
of the three manipulated water treatments were three times more
susceptible to worm establishment in their guts, and thus less
resistant to infection, compared to frogs reared in natural pond
water (Fig. 4b). In addition, adult resistance to infection could not
be explained by juvenile mass at metamorphosis (GLMM,
χ2 = 0.00, df = 1, P = 0.98), days to metamorphosis (χ2 = 0.19,
df = 1, P = 0.66), or adult mass (χ2 = 0.92, df = 1, P = 0.34).
Parasite treatment did not significantly affect bacterial diversity of
adults (phylogenetic diversity: χ2 = 0.10, df = 1, P = 0.75, Shan-
non index: χ2 = 0.11, df = 1, P = 0.74, observed operational
taxonomic units (OTUs): χ2 = 1.81, df = 1, P = 0.18, equitability:
χ2 = 0.00, df = 1, P = 0.98).
Structural equation model. Given the convergence of the gut
microbiota in adults across water treatments, the effect of juvenile
water treatments on adult host resistance must be mediated by
the microbiota of juveniles (Supplementary Fig. 2). This conclu-
sion is supported by our SEM, which shows that the early-life
reduction of host bacterial diversity associated with the water
treatments (P < 0.0001) seemed to drive the increase in worm
establishment later in life (P = 0.002; Fig. 5; Supplementary Fig. 1;
Supplementary Table 2). In contrast, adult bacterial diversity
during parasite exposure did not affect worm establishment in the
SEM. Because the long-term antibiotic treatment affected the
growth and survival of frogs (Supplementary Table 3), we
included two additional SEM analyses: (1) without samples from
the long-term antibiotic treatment (Supplementary Table 4), and
(2) with samples from the long-term antibiotic treatment but also
additional models with the effect of adult mass and tank-level
survival on adult resistance to parasites (Supplementary Table 5).
In these additional analyses, the top model remains the same as in
the original SEM (Supplementary Table 2).
Bacterial taxa and host resistance. Relative abundance of phy-
lum Fusobacteria was negatively related to the number of worms
in the guts of adults (guts: χ2 = 5.61, df = 1, P = 0.01; skin: χ2 =
2.65, df = 1, P = 0.10). Specifically, as the relative abundance of
genus
Cetobacterium
increased
in
juveniles,
infection
risk
decreased in adults (guts: χ2 = 4.99, df = 1, P = 0.03; skin: χ2 =
7.44, P = 0.006). See Supplementary Table 6 for the relationships
between relative abundances of genera in juveniles and adults and
parasite establishment in adults.
Discussion
Our results, using an amphibian model, show that an early-life
disruption in host-associated microbiota can increase infection
risk later in life. Specifically, bacterial diversity and relative
abundance of phylum Fusobacteria (including genus Cetobacter-
ium) in juveniles negatively correlated with infection risk in adult
frogs. Moreover, bacterial diversity in adult frogs at the time of
parasite exposure was not correlated with host resistance, in
contrast with results of previous studies in mice and insects1–3.
Our results suggest that an early-life disruption of the host-
associated microbiota may affect the development of host resis-
tance mechanisms, such as immunity, and has enduring effects on
infection susceptibility later in life.
We think that the microbiota of juveniles likely played a role in
priming the immune system against parasite establishment. We
found that the relative abundance of certain bacteria phyla, such
as Fusobacteria, in juveniles was positively correlated with para-
site resistance in adulthood. We speculate that treatment-induced
reductions of Fusobacteria may have disrupted immune system
development, leading to decreased resistance to infection later in
life. Interestingly, studies show that germ-free mice devoid of
Fusobacteria exhibit lower IgG antibody production to pathogens
when compared to conventional mice17. The analogous antibody
in frogs (IgY) is produced in response to A. hamatospicula
establishment in their guts16, providing a candidate immune
mechanism for our results that can be explored in future studies.
Other potential resistance mechanisms could be identified by
characterizing host gene expression (e.g., using RNA-seq) of
candidate immune genes in both juveniles and adults18.
The microbiota of adult frogs at the time of parasite exposure
did not affect host resistance. In contrast, previous studies on mice
and insects have found that bacterial communities help defend

 their hosts against parasites at time of exposure by creating
unfavorable conditions, maintaining the immune system against
intruders, or outcompeting them1–5; our study suggests that the
adult frog microbiota did not affect any of these conditions for
worm establishment. We found that variation in bacterial diversity
across treatments decreased after metamorphosis (i.e., bacterial
diversity became
more
homogeneous
after
metamorphosis)
(Fig. 2c), which is likely the result of either frog metamorphosis19
or the adult diet consisting of non-sterile crickets reducing the
treatment-induced variation in the microbiota that existed in the
juvenile environment. The relatively minor variation in the bac-
terial diversity of adults was probably not enough to differentially
affect worm fitness. Alternatively, the large impact of an early-life
disruption to the microbiota may have overshadowed any effect of
adult microbiota on parasite susceptibility.
Absolute abundance of bacterial taxa might also play a role in
infection risk, but this aspect was not investigated in our study.
A common method to quantify absolute abundance is quantita-
tive PCR to determine the copies of 16S rRNA per gram of gut
contents. However, we extracted bacterial DNA from the entire
gut (intestines and contents) to maximize biomass recovery and
therefore we did not specifically weigh the contents of the gut.
Future studies could include absolute abundance data by
removing, weighing, and extracting bacterial DNA from only the
contents of the intestines. In addition, our study focused on
bacterial communities, but we acknowledge that other microbial
groups, such as fungi, archaea, protists, and viruses, were likely
altered by our experimental treatments and may have affected
infection risk, which should also be explored in the future.
Our work supports the idea that there are crucial windows in
development during which microbiota disruption may be parti-
cularly costly, having adverse persistent effects on infection risk.
Although our study focused on frogs, we speculate that early-life
microbiota disruption in humans might result in some similar
effects, because of the known similarities in general microbiota
composition and immune systems of frogs and mammals20. That
is, an early-life disruption of human microbiota might stimulate
an under-reactive immune response to infections, in addition to
the previously established over-reactive immune response to
innocuous agents (allergens and host)13. Furthermore, several
factors, such as pollutants (including antibiotics)2, 21, 22, nutri-
tion23–25, and climate26 can disrupt the microbiota of animal
hosts, and as a consequence, they might affect infectious disease
risk27, 28.
Methods
Experimental protocol. Eighty 4L tanks received four O. septentrionalis tadpoles
(juveniles) each, which were collected from pools at the University of South Florida
(USF) Botanical Gardens, Hillsborough County, FL, USA (scientific collecting
permit #LSSC-15-00014). All animal care procedures were in accordance with
University of South Florida’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
(IACUC protocol #IS00001610). The mean (±s.e.m.) Gosner stage for juveniles at
the beginning of the experiment was 32.10 (±1.10); Gosner stage represents the
development stage of advancement toward metamorphosis in tadpoles29. Juveniles
were assigned randomly to one of four water treatments (20 tanks per treatment):

 pond water (PW), sterile (autoclaved) pond water only (SPW), sterile pond water
and short-term antibiotics (STAB), or sterile pond water and long-term antibiotics
(LTAB). Juveniles from the short-term and long-term antibiotic treatments were
exposed to a cocktail of antibiotics (30 mg/L enrofloxacin (Fluka, Sigma, St. Louis,
MO, USA), 13.3 mg/L sulfamethazine and 2.67 mg/L trimethoprim (Thomas Labs,
Fish Sulfa Forte, Tolleson, AZ, USA), and 5000 µg/L streptomycin and 5000 I.U./L
penicillin (Mediatech, Inc., Manassas, VA, USA)) in sterile pond water for 24 h and
4 weeks, respectively; these were half the recommended doses from Holden et al.30.
For the long-term antibiotic treatment, the antibiotic cocktail was added to the tank
during each weekly water change. For sterilization, pond water was autoclaved in
10L carboys for 60 min at 121 °C.
Tanks were maintained in the laboratory (12 h light cycle, air temperature:
22 °C, water temperature: 22.6 °C, pH: 7.7, dissolved oxygen: 5.9 mg/L, nitrates:
0.96 mg/L) and all juveniles were fed ad libitum with a mixture of sterilized
spirulina (NOW foods, Bloomingdale, IL, USA) and fish flakes (Omega One, Sitka,
AK, USA) in an agarose block (autoclaved for 15 min at 121 °C). Juvenile survival
was checked daily and water was changed weekly. After 4 weeks in the water
treatments, 10 juveniles from each water treatment were euthanized to characterize
their bacterial community (Fig. 1). Their skin was swabbed with sterile cotton
swabs to characterize skin bacteria and then juvenile GI tracts were removed to
characterize their gut bacteria. Skin swabs and guts were frozen at −80 °C until
DNA extractions.
The remaining juveniles in each tank were allowed to metamorphose.
Individuals with all four limbs were removed from the tanks daily, weighed, and
placed in cups (6 cm high × 12 cm diameter) with sterile organic Sphagnum sp.
moss (Mosser Lee, Millston, WI, USA) (autoclaved for 30 min at 121 °C). The
adults were maintained in the laboratory (12 h light cycle, 22 °C) on vitamin- and
mineral-dusted crickets (vitamins and minerals: Rep-Cal Herptivite Multivitamin
powder and Rep-Cal Calcium with Vitamin D3 powder, Los Gatos, CA, USA;
crickets: Acheta domesticus, Armstrong’s Cricket Farm, Glenville, GA, USA) (fed
ad libitum) and survival was checked daily.
Approximately 2 months after metamorphosis (mean ± s.e.m. = 63.21 ±
2.75 days), frogs were weighed and then exposed to A. hamatospicula worms,
which were collected from naturally parasitized adults at Flatwoods Park,
Hillsborough County, FL, USA. Frogs were placed individually in parafilm-sealed
petri dishes (100 mm diameter) with an air hole at the top of the lid; frogs were

Fig. 3 Effect of juvenile water treatment on relative abundance of bacterial phyla. We analyzed the bacterial community of the gut a and skin b of juveniles,
as well as that of the gut of adults c. Water treatments include pond water (PW), sterile pond water only (SPW), sterile pond water and short-term
antibiotics (STAB), or sterile pond water and long-term antibiotics (LTAB). For juvenile guts a, mean relative abundance of phylum Proteobacteria was
three times higher for individuals from sterile pond water only (GLM, χ2 = 25.09, df = 3, P < 0.0001), Firmicutes was three times higher for individuals from
pond water and short-term antibiotics (χ2 = 13.92, df = 3, P = 0.003), and Chloroflexi was higher for individuals from pond water (χ2 = 25.11, df = 3,
P < 0.0001) compared to individuals from the other treatments. For juvenile skin b, relative abundance of phylum Actinobacteria was 20 times higher for
individuals from long-term antibiotic water compared to the other three treatments (χ2 = 70.42, df = 3, P < 0.0001) and Bacteroidetes was three times
higher for individuals from pond water compared to individuals from long-term antibiotic water (χ2 = 11.89, df = 3, P = 0.008). For adult guts, relative
abundance of phylum Actinobacteria was five times higher for adults reared in sterile pond water compared to adults reared in long-term antibiotic water
(GLMM, χ2 = 10.05, df = 3, P = 0.02), Spirochaetes was generally higher in adults reared in pond water but was only significantly higher compared to
adults reared in short- and long-term antibiotic water (χ2 = 14.39, df = 3, P = 0.002), and Cyanobacteria was lower for adults reared in long-term antibiotic
water compared to adults reared in pond water and short-term antibiotic water (χ2 = 12.23, df = 3, P = 0.007). Numbers above the bars are the number of

 then exposed to worms (see Fig. 1 for sample sizes) or sham-exposed (PW: n = 17
individuals from 13 tanks; SPW: n = 20/18; STAB: n = 22/17; LTAB: n = 16/14) by
pipetting 10 infectious larval A. hamatospicula worms in 3 mL of autoclaved pond
water or 3 mL of autoclaved pond water without worms through the hole in the lid,
respectively. After 24 h in the petri dish, we returned frogs to their individual cups
with sterile Sphagnum sp. moss and used a dissecting microscope to count the
worms remaining in the petri dish to determine the number of worms that
penetrated each frog. Three weeks after exposure to A. hamatospicula, frogs were
euthanized and necropsied to count the number of worms that established in their
GI tracts. Frog guts were then collected from a subsample of individuals (sham-
exposed: PW: n = 10 individuals, SPW: n = 10, STAB: n = 10, LTAB: n = 9; see
Fig. 1 for sample sizes for the parasitized treatment) and frozen at −80 °C until
DNA extractions.
We also determined whether juvenile worms could be observed on the surface
of the frog’s skin without penetrating the skin successfully after parasite exposure.
We exposed five additional frogs to juvenile worms using the methods described
above. After 24 h, we anesthetized frogs and scanned the surface of the skin for
visible worms that did not penetrate it successfully. We did not observe any
juvenile worms on the surface of the skin, which suggests that if worms were not
found in the petri dish, they penetrated the host successfully.
Bacterial DNA extraction and sequencing. We isolated total DNA from frog guts
and skin using a MoBio PowerFecal DNA Isolation Kit; DNA extracts were then
sent to Argonne National Labs for sequencing. We also extracted and sequenced
“blank” samples, which were collected using sham-necropsies and sham-
extractions (i.e., without an experimental sample) to control for methodological
contamination31. Bacterial inventories were conducted by amplifying the V4 region
of the 16S rRNA gene using primers 515F and 806R and paired end sequencing on
an Illumina MiSeq platform32. Sequences were analyzed using QIIME version
1.9.133. We applied standard quality control settings and split sequences into
libraries using default parameters in QIIME. Sequences were grouped into OTUs
using pick_open_reference_otus.py with a minimum sequence identity of 97%. The
most abundant sequences within each OTU were designated as a “representative
sequence” and aligned against the Greengenes core set34 using PyNAST35 with
default parameters set by QIIME. A PH Lane mask supplied by QIIME was used to
remove hypervariable regions from aligned sequences. A phylogenetic tree of
representative sequences was built using FastTree36. OTUs were classified tax-
onomically using UCLUST37 with the reference Greengenes database34. Singleton
OTUs and sequences identified as chloroplasts or mitochondria were removed
from the analysis. In addition, any OTUs present in the “blank samples” were
considered contaminants and were removed from all other samples31. Con-
taminant OTUs were largely similar to those presented in Salter et al.31.
Several measurements of alpha diversity were calculated. We calculated the
number of observed OTUs, equitability, the Shannon index, and Faith’s
phylogenetic diversity38, the latter of which measures the cumulative branch
lengths from randomly sampling 1900 sequences from each sample (the minimum
number of sequences returned from each sample). For each sample, we calculated
the mean of 20 iterations. We calculated unweighted and weighted UniFrac
distances between samples in QIIME using 1900 sequences for bacterial
community composition analyses.
Statistical analyses. We determined the effect of water treatment on juvenile
bacterial diversity using generalized linear models (GLMs) with Gaussian errors.
To determine the effect of juvenile water treatment on adult bacterial diversity,
mass at metamorphosis, days to metamorphosis, and adult mass, as well as the
effect of parasitism on adult bacterial diversity, we used generalized linear mixed
models (GLMMs) with Gaussian errors and tank as a random effect. Juvenile and
adult samples were collected from different individuals within the same replicate
(tank) because juvenile sampling required destructive sampling. Therefore, the
juvenile and adult samples within tanks were paired in the analyses. Gaussian
analyses were conducted using the glm (GLM) and lmer (GLMM) functions with
the lme4 package. We determined the effect of water treatment on juvenile and
adult survival using a censored Cox mixed effects model with the coxme function.
Probability values were calculated using log-likelihood ratio tests using the Anova
function in the car package. GLM, GLMM, and survival analyses were conducted in
RStudio (2013, version 0.98.1062). All figures were made in Prism (2008, version 5b).
We determined the effect of juvenile water treatment on bacterial community
membership (unweighted) and structure (weighted) using PERMANOVA + (with
999 permutations; 2008, version 1.0.1) in PRIMER (2008, version 6.1.11).
Bonferroni post hoc multiple comparison tests were used to compare bacterial
communities among treatment levels. For adults, tank of origin was included as a
random effect. We used principal coordinate analyses on unweighted UniFrac
distances to visualize similarities of bacterial community membership across water
treatments. Unweighted scores represent bacterial community membership, which
is based on the presence or absence of bacterial taxa, whereas weighted scores
represent bacterial community structure, which also takes into account relative
abundance of bacterial taxa.
To compare relative abundances of bacterial taxa across groups, we first
removed any phyla that were present in <25% of samples. Given that the gut
bacterial community is largely restructured over the course of metamorphosis19, we
compared relative abundances of bacteria in juveniles and adult frogs separately.
Relative abundances (arcsine square root transformed)39, 40 of bacterial phyla in
juveniles and adults were analyzed in JMP (version 12) using ANOVAs with water
treatment as an independent variable and, for adults, with tank as a random effect.
For all analyses, P-values were corrected using the false discovery rate correction
for multiple comparisons. We used GLMs (for juveniles) and GLMMs (for adults
with tank as a random effect) to compare the relationship between relative
abundance of phyla and genera and parasite establishment.
To determine the overall relationship among water treatment, juvenile and
adult bacterial phylogenetic diversity, and adult parasite susceptibility, we
employed SEM and factor analyses. SEM is a statistical technique based on the
analysis of variance–covariance matrices41, which can test web-like hypotheses
because variables can serve as both independent and dependent variables. The type
of analysis chosen for a candidate model was dependent on whether juvenile skin
and gut microbiota were combined as a latent variable (SEM; which combines
factor analysis with path analysis) or considered separate variables (path analysis
only). Analyses were conducted using the lavaan package in RStudio. SEMs were
only conducted on tanks for which we had all the measured variables: juvenile
bacterial diversity (gut and skin), adult gut bacterial diversity, and infection data.
Water treatment was either categorized as control (pond water) or experimental
(sterile pond water, short-term antibiotic exposure, or long-term antibiotic
exposure) for the SEM. We tested eight a priori hypothesized path models that
removed various sets of paths from the starting full model (Supplementary Fig. 1,
Supplementary Table 2). These eight models were ranked using AIC.

Fig. 5 Early-life disruption of juvenile skin and gut microbiota predicts later-life resistance to infection. Paths included in the best structural equation model
(SEM) based on Akaike information criterion are depicted with solid lines; paths not included in the best model are depicted with dotted lines. The best
model shows that the experimental water treatment reduced bacterial phylogenetic diversity in juveniles, and in turn, bacterial diversity in juveniles
negatively predicted worm establishment in the guts of adults. The best model combines gut and skin bacterial diversity of juveniles into a latent variable
(because they are positively correlated; GLM, χ2 = 31.95, df = 1, P < 0.0001) and therefore we use a factor score to present these data; numbers below the
“skin” and “gut” boxes are factor loadings. In contrast, treatment did not affect bacterial diversity of adults, bacterial diversity of juveniles was not related
significantly to bacterial diversity of adults, and bacterial diversity of adults was not related significantly to adult resistance to infection. The SEM only
included tanks for which there was a complete set of samples for skin and gut bacteria of juveniles, gut bacteria of adults, and infection data (n = 15; solid
points); clear points represent the remaining data. Control pond water treatment is represented in green and experimental water treatments (sterile pond
water, sterile pond water plus antibiotics) are represented in orange. Individual regressions based on the entire available data set provide similar results as
the SEM on the subset of complete data and thus we conservatively provide the results from only the subset. Error bars indicate the s.e.m. P-values and
standardized coefficients from the best model are shown next to each path. R2-values indicate total variance explained by predictor variables in the top
model. The χ2 of the best model was 0.38 (df = 2, P = 0.83), indicating that the model was a good fit to the data. This model accounted for 92% of the
model weight
