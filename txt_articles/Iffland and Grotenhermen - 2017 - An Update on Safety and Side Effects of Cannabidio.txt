An Update on Safety and Side Effects of Cannabidiol:
A Review of Clinical Data and Relevant Animal Studies
Kerstin Iffland and Franjo Grotenhermen
Abstract
Introduction: This literature survey aims to extend the comprehensive survey performed by Bergamaschi et al. in
2011 on cannabidiol (CBD) safety and side effects. Apart from updating the literature, this article focuses on clin-
ical studies and CBD potential interactions with other drugs.
Results: In general, the often described favorable safety profile of CBD in humans was confirmed and extended
by the reviewed research. The majority of studies were performed for treatment of epilepsy and psychotic dis-
orders. Here, the most commonly reported side effects were tiredness, diarrhea, and changes of appetite/weight.
In comparison with other drugs, used for the treatment of these medical conditions, CBD has a better side effect
profile. This could improve patients’ compliance and adherence to treatment. CBD is often used as adjunct ther-
apy. Therefore, more clinical research is warranted on CBD action on hepatic enzymes, drug transporters, and
interactions with other drugs and to see if this mainly leads to positive or negative effects, for example, reducing
the needed clobazam doses in epilepsy and therefore clobazam’s side effects.
Conclusion: This review also illustrates that some important toxicological parameters are yet to be studied, for
example, if CBD has an effect on hormones. Additionally, more clinical trials with a greater number of participants
and longer chronic CBD administration are still lacking.

Introduction
Since several years, other pharmacologically relevant
constituents of the Cannabis plant, apart from D9-
THC, have come into the focus of research and legisla-
tion. The most prominent of those is cannabidiol
(CBD). In contrast to D9-THC, it is nonintoxicating,
but exerts a number of beneficial pharmacological
effects. For instance, it is anxiolytic, anti-inflammatory,
antiemetic, and antipsychotic. Moreover, neuropro-
tective properties have been shown.1,2 Consequently,
it could be used at high doses for the treatment of a
variety of conditions ranging in psychiatric disorders
such as schizophrenia and dementia, as well as diabe-
tes and nausea.1,2
At lower doses, it has physiological effects that pro-
mote and maintain health, including antioxidative,
anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotection effects. For in-
stance, CBD is more effective than vitamin C and E as a
neuroprotective antioxidant and can ameliorate skin
conditions such as acne.3,4
The comprehensive review of 132 original studies by
Bergamaschi et al. describes the safety profile of CBD,
mentioning several properties: catalepsy is not induced
and physiological parameters are not altered (heart
rate, blood pressure, and body temperature). Moreover,
psychological and psychomotor functions are not ad-
versely affected. The same holds true for gastrointesti-
nal transit, food intake, and absence of toxicity for

 nontransformed cells. Chronic use and high doses of
up to 1500 mg per day have been repeatedly shown
to be well tolerated by humans.1
Nonetheless, some side effects have been reported
for CBD, but mainly in vitro or in animal studies.
They include alterations of cell viability, reduced fertil-
ization capacity, and inhibition of hepatic drug metab-
olism and drug transporters (e.g., p-glycoprotein).1
Consequently, more human studies have to be con-
ducted to see if these effects also occur in humans. In
these studies, a large enough number of subjects have
to be enrolled to analyze long-term safety aspects and
CBD possible interactions with other substances.
This review will build on the clinical studies men-
tioned by Bergamaschi et al. and will update their sur-
vey with new studies published until September 2016.
Relevant Preclinical Studies
Before we discuss relevant animal research on CBD
possible effects on various parameters, several impor-
tant differences between route of administration and
pharmacokinetics between human and animal studies
have to be mentioned. First, CBD has been studied in
humans using oral administration or inhalation.
Administration in rodents often occures either via in-
traperitoneal injection or via the oral route. Second,
the plasma levels reached via oral administration in
rodents and humans can differ. Both these observa-
tions can lead to differing active blood concentrations
of CBD.1,5,6
In addition, it is possible that CBD targets differ be-
tween humans and animals. Therefore, the same blood
concentration might still lead to different effects. Even
if the targets, to which CBD binds, are the same in both
studied animals and humans, for example, the affinity
or duration of CBD binding to its targets might differ
and consequently alter its effects.
The following study, which showed a positive effect
of CBD on obsessive compulsive behavior in mice
and reported no side effects, exemplifies the existing
pharmacokinetic differences.5 When mice and hu-
mans are given the same CBD dose, more of the com-
pound becomes available in the mouse organism. This
higher bioavailability, in turn, can cause larger CBD
effects.
Deiana et al. administered 120 mg/kg CBD either
orally or intraperitoneally and measured peak plasma
levels.5 The group of mice, which received oral CBD,
had plasma levels of 2.2 lg/ml CBD. In contrast, i.p. in-
jections resulted in peak plasma levels of 14.3 lg/ml.
Administering 10 mg/kg oral CBD to humans leads
to blood levels of 0.01 lg/ml.6 This corresponds to
human blood levels of 0.12 lg/ml, when 120 mg/kg
CBD was given to humans. This calculation was per-
formed assuming the pharmacokinetics of a hydro-
philic compound, for simplicity’s sake. We are aware
that the actual levels of the lipophilic CBD will vary.
A second caveat of preclinical studies is that supra-
physiological concentrations of compounds are often
used. This means that the observed effects, for instance,
are not caused by a specific binding of CBD to one of its
receptors but are due to unspecific binding following
the high compound concentration, which can inacti-
vate the receptor or transporter.
The following example and calculations will dem-
onstrate this. In vitro studies have shown that CBD in-
hibits the ABC transporters P-gp (P glycoprotein
also referred to as ATP-binding cassette subfamily B
member
1 = ABCB1;
3–100 lM
CBD)
and
Bcrp
(Breast Cancer Resistance Protein; also referred to as
ABCG2 = ATP-binding cassette subfamily G mem-
ber 2).7 After 3 days, the P-gp protein expression
was altered in leukemia cells. This can have several
implications because various anticancer drugs also
bind to these membrane-bound, energy-dependent ef-
flux transporters.1 The used CBD concentrations are
supraphysiological, however, 3 lM CBD approximately
corresponds to plasma concentrations of 1 lg/ml. On
the contrary, a 700 mg CBD oral dose reached a plasma
level of 10 ng/ml.6 This means that to reach a 1 lg/ml
plasma concentration, one would need to administer
considerably higher doses of oral CBD. The highest
ever applied CBD dose was 1500 mg.1 Consequently,
more research is warranted, where the CBD effect on
ABC transporters is analyzed using CBD concentra-
tions of, for example, 0.03–0.06 lM. The rationale be-
hind suggesting these concentrations is that studies
summarized by Bih et al. on CBD effect on ABCC1
and ABCG2 in SF9 human cells showed that a CBD
concentration of 0.08 lM elicited the first effect.7
Using the pharmacokinetic relationships mentioned
above, one would need to administer an oral CBD dose
of 2100 mg CBD to affect ABCC1 and ABCG2. We
used 10 ng/ml for these calculations and the ones in
Table 1,6,8 based on a 6-week trial using a daily oral ad-
ministration of 700 mg CBD, leading to mean plasma
levels of 6–11 ng/ml, which reflects the most realistic
scenario of CBD administration in patients.6 That
these levels seem to be reproducible, and that chronic
CBD administration does not lead to elevated mean

 blood concentrations, was shown by another study. A
single dose of 600 mg led to reduced anxiety and
mean CBD blood concentrations of 4.7–17ng/ml.9
It also seems warranted to assume that the mean
plasma concentration exerts the total of observed CBD
effects, compared to using peak plasma levels, which
only prevail for a short amount of time. This is not
withstanding, that a recent study measured Cmax
values for CBD of 221 ng/ml, 3 h after administration
of 1 mg/kg fentanyl concomitantly with a single oral
dose of 800 mg CBD.10
CBD-drug interactions
Cytochrome P450-complex enzymes.
This paragraph
describes
CBD interaction with general (drug)-
metabolizing enzymes, such as those belonging to
the cytochrome P450 family. This might have an effect
for coadministration of CBD with other drugs.7 For
instance, CBD is metabolized, among others, via the
CYP3A4 enzyme. Various drugs such as ketoconazol,
itraconazol, ritonavir, and clarithromycin inhibit this
enzyme.11 This leads to slower CBD degradation and
can consequently lead to higher CBD doses that are
longer pharmaceutically active. In contrast, pheno-
barbital, rifampicin, carbamazepine, and phenytoin
induce CYP3A4, causing reduced CBD bioavailabili-
ty.11 Approximately 60% of clinically prescribed
drugs are metabolized via CYP3A4.1 Table 1 shows
an overview of the cytochrome inhibiting potential
of CBD. It has to be pointed out though, that the
in vitro studies used supraphysiological CBD concen-
trations.
Studies in mice have shown that CBD inactivates
cytochrome P450 isozymes in the short term, but
can induce them after repeated administration. This
is similar to their induction by phenobarbital, thereby
implying the 2b subfamily of isozymes.1 Another
study showed this effect to be mediated by upregula-
tion of mRNA for CYP3A, 2C, and 2B10, after re-
peated CBD administration.1
Hexobarbital is a CYP2C19 substrate, which is an
enzyme that can be inhibited by CBD and can conse-
quently increase hexobarbital availability in the organ-
ism.12,13 Studies also propose that this effect might be
caused in vivo by one of CBD metabolites.14,15 Gener-
ally, the metabolite 6a-OH-CBD was already demon-
strated to be an inducer of CYP2B10. Recorcinol was
also found to be involved in CYP450 induction. The
enzymes CYP3A and CYP2B10 were induced after pro-
longed CBD administration in mice livers, as well as for
human CYP1A1 in vitro.14,15 On the contrary, CBD
induces CYP1A1, which is responsible for degradation
of cancerogenic substances such as benzopyrene.
CYP1A1 can be found in the intestine and CBD-
induced higher activity could therefore prevent absorp-
tion of cancerogenic substances into the bloodstream
and thereby help to protect DNA.2
Effects on P-glycoprotein activity and other drug
transporters.
A recent study with P-gp, Bcrp, and
P-gp/Bcrp knockout mice, where 10mg/kg was injected
subcutaneously, showed that CBD is not a substrate of
these transporters itself. This means that they do not
reduce CBD transport to the brain.16 This phenome-
non also occurs with paracetamol and haloperidol,
which both inhibit P-gp, but are not actively trans-
ported substrates. The same goes for gefitinib inhibi-
tion of Bcrp.
These proteins are also expressed at the blood–brain
barrier, where they can pump out drugs such as risper-
idone. This is hypothesized to be a cause of treatment re-
sistance.16 In addition, polymorphisms in these genes,
making transport more efficient, have been implied in
interindividual differences in pharmacoresistance.10
Moreover, the CBD metabolite 7-COOH CBD might
be a potent anticonvulsant itself.14 It will be interesting

aThe calculations made here are based on the assumption that the CBD distribution in the blood follows the pharmacokinetics of a hydrophilic
substance such as alcohol. The reality is more complex, because CBD is lipophilic and, for example, will consequently accumulate in fat tissue.
These calculations were made with the intention to give the reader an impression and an approximation of the supraphysiological levels used in
in vitro studies.

 to see whether it is a P-gp substrate and alters pharma-
cokinetics of coadministered P-gp-substrate drugs.
An in vitro study using three types of trophoblast cell
lines and ex vivo placenta, perfused with 15lM CBD,
found BCRP inhibition leading to accumulation of xe-
nobiotics in the fetal compartment.17 BCRP is expressed
at the apical side of the syncytiotrophoblast and removes
a wide variety of compounds forming a part of the pla-
cental barrier. Seventy-two hours of chronic incubation
with 25 lM CBD also led to morphological changes in
the cell lines, but not to a direct cytotoxic effect. In
contrast, 1 lM CBD did not affect cell and placenta vi-
ability.17 The authors consider this effect cytostatic.
Nicardipine was used as the BCRP substrate in the
in vitro studies, where the Jar cell line showed the larg-
est increase in BCRP expression correlating with the
highest level of transport.17,and references therein
The ex vivo study used the antidiabetic drug and
BCRP substrate glyburide.17 After 2 h of CBD perfu-
sion, the largest difference between the CBD and the
placebo placentas (n = 8 each) was observed. CBD inhi-
bition of the BCRP efflux function in the placental cot-
yledon warrants further research of coadministration
of CBD with known BCRP substrates such as nitrofur-
antoin, cimetidine, and sulfasalazine. In this study, a
dose–response curve should be established in male
and female subjects (CBD absorption was shown to
be higher in women) because the concentrations used
here are usually not reached by oral or inhaled CBD ad-
ministration. Nonetheless, CBD could accumulate in
organs physiologically restricted via a blood barrier.17
Physiological effects
CBD treatment of up to 14 days (3–30 mg/kg b.w. i.p.)
did not affect blood pressure, heart rate, body temper-
ature, glucose levels, pH, pCO2, pO2, hematocrit, K+ or
Na+ levels, gastrointestinal transit, emesis, or rectal
temperature in a study with rodents.1
Mice treated with 60 mg/kg b.w. CBD i.p. for 12
weeks (three times per week) did not show ataxia, ky-
phosis, generalized tremor, swaying gait, tail stiffness,
changes in vocalization behavior or open-field physio-
logical activity (urination, defecation).1
Neurological and neurospychiatric effects
Anxiety and depression.
Some studies indicate that
under certain circumstances, CBD acute anxiolytic ef-
fects in rats were reversed after repeated 14-day admin-
istration of CBD.2 However, this finding might depend
on the used animal model of anxiety or depression.
This is supported by a study, where CBD was admin-
istered in an acute and ‘‘chronic’’ (2 weeks) regi-
men, which measured anxiolytic/antidepressant effects,
using behavioral and operative models (OBX = olfactory
bulbectomy as model for depression).18 The only ob-
served side effects were reduced sucrose preference,
reduced food consumption and body weight in the
nonoperated animals treated with CBD (50 mg/kg).
Nonetheless, the behavioral tests (for OBX-induced hy-
peractivity and anhedonia related to depression and
open field test for anxiety) in the CBD-treated OBX an-
imals showed an improved emotional response. Using
microdialysis, the researchers could also show elevated
5-HT and glutamate levels in the prefrontal cortex of
OBX animals only. This area was previously described
to be involved in maladaptive behavioral regulation in
depressed patients and is a feature of the OBX animal
model of depression. The fact that serotonin levels were
only elevated in the OBX mice is similar to CBD differ-
ential action under physiological and pathological con-
ditions.
A similar effect was previously described in anxiety
experiments, where CBD proved to be only anxiolytic
in subjects where stress had been induced before CBD
administration. Elevated glutamate levels have been
proposed to be responsible for ketamine’s fast antide-
pressant function and its dysregulation has been de-
scribed in OBX mice and depressed patients. Chronic
CBD treatment did not elicit behavioral changes in
the nonoperated mice. In contrast, CBD was able to al-
leviate the affected functionality of 5HT1A receptors
in limbic brain areas of OBX mice.18 and references therein
Schiavon et al. cite three studies that used chronic
CBD administration to demonstrate its anxiolytic effects
in chronically stressed rats, which were mostly mediated
via hippocampal neurogenesis.19 and references therein
For instance, animals received daily i.p. injections of
5 mg/kg CBD. Applying a 5HT1A receptor antagonist
in the DPAG (dorsal periaqueductal gray area), it was
implied that CBD exerts its antipanic effects via these
serotonin receptors. No adverse effects were reported
in this study.
Psychosis and bipolar disorder.
Various studies on
CBD and psychosis have been conducted.20 For in-
stance, an animal model of psychosis can be created
in mice by using the NMDAR antagonist MK-801.
The behavioral changes (tested with the prepulse inhi-
bition [PPI] test) were concomitant with decreased
mRNA expression of the NMDAR GluN1 subunit

 gene (GRN1) in the hippocampus, decreased parvalbu-
min expression (=a calcium-binding protein expressed
in a subclass of GABAergic interneurons), and higher
FosB/DFosB expression (=markers for neuronal activi-
ty). After 6 days of MK-801 treatment, various CBD
doses were injected intraperitoneally (15, 30, 60 mg/kg)
for 22 days. The two higher CBD doses had beneficial ef-
fects comparable to the atypical antipsychotic drug clo-
zapine and also attenuated the MK-801 effects on the
three markers mentioned above. The publication did
not record any side effects.21
One of the theories trying to explain the etiology of
bipolar disorder (BD) is that oxidative stress is crucial
in its development. Valvassori et al. therefore used an
animal model of amphetamine-induced hyperactivity
to model one of the symptoms of mania. Rats were
treated for 14 days with various CBD concentrations
(15, 30, 60 mg/kg daily i.p.). Whereas CBD did not
have an effect on locomotion, it did increase brain-
derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels and could
protect against amphetamine-induced oxidative damage
in proteins of the hippocampus and striatum. No ad-
verse effects were recorded in this study.22
Another model for BD and schizophrenia is PPI of
the startle reflex both in humans and animals, which
is disrupted in these diseases. Peres et al., list five ani-
mal studies, where mostly 30 mg/kg CBD was adminis-
tered and had a positive effect on PPI.20 Nonetheless,
some inconsistencies in explaining CBD effects on
PPI as model for BD exist. For example, CBD some-
times did not alter MK-801-induced PPI disruption,
but disrupted PPI on its own.20 If this effect can be ob-
served in future experiments, it could be considered to
be a possible side effect.
Addiction.
CBD, which is nonhedonic, can reduce
heroin-seeking
behavior
after,
for
example,
cue-
induced reinstatement. This was shown in an animal
heroin self-administration study, where mice received
5 mg/kg CBD i.p. injections. The observed effect lasted
for 2 weeks after CBD administration and could nor-
malize the changes seen after stimulus cue-induced
heroin seeking (expression of AMPA, GluR1, and
CB1R). In addition, the described study was able to
replicate previous findings showing no CBD side effects
on locomotor behavior.23
Neuroprotection and neurogenesis.
There are vari-
ous mechanisms underlying neuroprotection, for ex-
ample, energy metabolism (whose alteration has been
implied in several psychiatric disorders) and proper
mitochondrial functioning.24 An early study from
1976 found no side effects and no effect of 0.3–
300 lg/mg protein CBD after 1 h of incubation on mi-
tochondrial monoamine oxidase activity in porcine
brains.25 In hypoischemic newborn pigs, CBD elicited
a neuroprotective effect, caused no side effects, and
even led to beneficial effects on ventilatory, cardiac,
and hemodynamic functions.26
A study comparing acute and chronic CBD admin-
istration in rats suggests an additional mechanism of
CBD neuroprotection: Animals received i.p. CBD (15,
30, 60 mg/kg b.w.) or vehicle daily, for 14 days. Mito-
chondrial activity was measured in the striatum, hippo-
campus, and the prefrontal cortex.27 Acute and chronic
CBD injections led to increased mitochondrial activity
(complexes I-V) and creatine kinase, whereas no side
effects were documented. Chronic CBD treatment
and the higher CBD doses tended to affect more
brain regions. The authors hypothesized that CBD
changed the intracellular Ca2 + flux to cause these ef-
fects. Since the mitochondrial complexes I and II
have been implied in various neurodegenerative dis-
eases and also altered ROS (reactive oxygen species)
levels, which have also been shown to be altered by
CBD, this might be an additional mechanism of
CBD-mediated neuroprotection.1,27
Interestingly, it has recently been shown that the
higher ROS levels observed after CBD treatment were
concomitant with higher mRNA and protein levels
of heat shock proteins (HSPs). In healthy cells, this
can be interpreted as a way to protect against the
higher ROS levels resulting from more mitochondrial
activity. In addition, it was shown that HSP inhibitors
increase the CBD anticancer effect in vitro.28 This is in
line with the studies described by Bergamaschi et al.,
which also imply ROS in CBD effect on (cancer) cell
viability in addition to, for example, proapoptotic
pathways such as via caspase-8/9 and inhibition of
the procarcinogenic lipoxygenase pathway.1
Another publication studied the difference of acute
and chronic administration of two doses of CBD in non-
stressed mice on anxiety. Already an acute i.p. adminis-
tration of 3 mg/kg was anxiolytic to a degree comparable
to 20 mg/kg imipramine (an selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitor [SSRI] commonly prescribed for anxiety and
depression). Fifteen days of repeated i.p. administration
of 3 mg/kg CBD also increased cell proliferation and
neurogenesis (using three different markers) in the sub-
ventricular zone and the hippocampal dentate gyrus.

http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/can.2016.0034
143
 Interestingly, the repeated administration of 30 mg/kg
also led to anxiolytic effects. However, the higher
dose caused a decrease in neurogenesis and cell prolif-
eration, indicating dissociation of behavioral and pro-
liferative effects of chronic CBD treatment. The study
does not mention adverse effects.19
Immune system
Numerous studies show the CBD immunomodulatory
role in various diseases such as multiple sclerosis, ar-
thritis, and diabetes. These animal and human ex vivo
studies have been reviewed extensively elsewhere, but
studies with pure CBD are still lacking. Often combi-
nations of THC and CBD were used. It would be
especially interesting to study when CBD is proin-
flammatory and under which circumstances it is
anti-inflammatory and whether this leads to side ef-
fects (Burstein, 2015: Table 1 shows a summary of
its anti-inflammatory actions; McAllister et al. give
an extensive overview in Table 1 of the interplay be-
tween CBD anticancer effects and inflammation
signaling).29,30
In case of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), studies in mice
and rats showed reduced amyloid beta neuroinflamma-
tion (linked to reduced interleukin [IL]-6 and micro-
glial activation) after CBD treatment. This led to
amelioration of learning effects in a pharmacological
model of AD. The chronic study we want to describe
in more detail here used a transgenic mouse model of
AD, where 2.5-month-old mice were treated with ei-
ther placebo or daily oral CBD doses of 20 mg/kg for
8 months (mice are relatively old at this point). CBD
was able to prevent the development of a social recog-
nition deficit in the AD transgenic mice.
Moreover, the elevated IL-1 beta and TNF alpha levels
observed in the transgenic mice could be reduced to WT
(wild-type) levels with CBD treatment. Using statistical
analysis by analysis of variance, this was shown to be
only a trend. This might have been caused by the high
variation in the transgenic mouse group, though. Also,
CBD increased cholesterol levels in WT mice but not in
CBD-treated transgenic mice. This was probably due to
already elevated cholesterol in the transgenic mice. The
study observed no side effects.31 and references within
In nonobese diabetes-prone female mice (NOD),
CBD was administered i.p. for 4 weeks (5 days a
week) at a dose of 5 mg/kg per day. After CBD treat-
ment was stopped, observation continued until the
mice were 24 weeks old. CBD treatment lead to consid-
erable reduction of diabetes development (32% devel-
oped glucosuria in the CBD group compared to 100%
in untreated controls) and to more intact islet of Lang-
erhans cells. CBD increased IL-10 levels, which is
thought to act as an anti-inflammatory cytokine in
this context. The IL-12 production of splenocytes was
reduced in the CBD group and no side effects were
recorded.32
After inducing arthritis in rats using Freund’s adju-
vant, various CBD doses (0.6, 3.1, 6.2, or 62.3 mg/
day) were applied daily in a gel for transdermal admin-
istration for 4 days. CBD reduced joint swelling,
immune cell infiltration. thickening of the synovial
membrane, and nociceptive sensitization/spontaneous
pain in a dose-dependent manner, after four consecu-
tive days of CBD treatment. Proinflammatory bio-
markers were also reduced in a dose-dependent
manner in the dorsal root ganglia (TNF alpha) and spi-
nal cord (CGRP, OX42). No side effects were evident
and exploratory behavior was not altered (in contrast
to D9-THC, which caused hypolocomotion).33
Cell migration
Embryogenesis.
CBD was shown to be able to influ-
ence migratory behavior in cancer, which is also an im-
portant aspect of embryogenesis.1 For instance, it was
recently shown that CBD inhibits Id-1. Helix-loop-
helix Id proteins play a role in embryogenesis and nor-
mal development via regulation of cell differentiation.
High Id1-levels were also found in breast, prostate,
brain, and head and neck tumor cells, which were
highly aggressive. In contrast, Id1 expression was low
in noninvasive tumor cells. Id1 seems to influence the
tumor cell phenotype by regulation of invasion, epithe-
lial to mesenchymal transition, angiogenesis, and cell
proliferation.34
There only seems to exist one study that could not
show an adverse CBD effect on embryogenesis. An
in vitro study could show that the development of
two-cell embryos was not arrested at CBD concentra-
tions of 6.4, 32, and 160 nM.35
Cancer.
Various studies have been performed to
study CBD anticancer effects. CBD anti-invasive ac-
tions seem to be mediated by its TRPV1 stimulation
and its action on the CB receptors. Intraperitoneal ap-
plication of 5 mg/kg b.w. CBD every 3 days for a total of
28 weeks, almost completely reduced the development
of metastatic nodules caused by injection of human
lung carcinoma cells (A549) in nude mice.36 This effect
was mediated by upregulation of ICAM1 and TIMP1.

144
 This, in turn, was caused by upstream regulation of p38
and p42/44 MAPK pathways. The typical side effects of
traditional anticancer medication, emesis, and collat-
eral toxicity were not described in these studies. Conse-
quently, CBD could be an alternative to other MMP1
inhibitors such as marimastat and prinomastat, which
have shown disappointing clinical results due to these
drugs’ adverse muscoskeletal effects.37,38
Two studies showed in various cell lines and in
tumor-bearing mice that CBD was able to reduce
tumor metastasis.34,39 Unfortunately, the in vivo study
was only described in a conference abstract and no
route of administration or CBD doses were men-
tioned.36 However, an earlier study used 0.1, 1.0, or
1.5 lmol/L CBD for 3 days in the aggressive breast can-
cer cells MDA-MB231. CBD downregulated Id1 at pro-
moter level and reduced tumor aggressiveness.40
Another study used xenografts to study the proapop-
totic effect of CBD, this time in LNCaP prostate carci-
noma cells.36 In this 5-week study, 100 mg/kg CBD was
administered daily i.p. Tumor volume was reduced by
60% and no adverse effects of treatment were described
in the study. The authors assumed that the observed
antitumor effects were mediated via TRPM8 together
with ROS release and p53 activation.41 It has to be
pointed out though, that xenograft studies only have
limited predictive validity to results with humans.
Moreover, to carry out these experiments, animals
are often immunologically compromised, to avoid im-
munogenic reactions as a result to implantation of
human cells into the animals, which in turn can also
affect the results.42
Another approach was chosen by Aviello et al.43
They used the carcinogen azoxymethane to induce
colon cancer in mice. Treatment occurred using IP in-
jections of 1 or 5 mg/kg CBD, three times a week for 3
weeks (including 1 week before carcinogen adminis-
tration). After 3 months, the number of aberrant
crypt foci, polyps, and tumors was analyzed. The
high CBD concentration led to a significant decrease
in polyps and a return to near-normal levels of phos-
phorylated Akt (elevation caused by the carcino-
gen).42 No adverse effects were mentioned in the
described study.43
Food intake and glycemic effects
Animal studies summarized by Bergamaschi et al.
showed inconclusive effects of CBD on food intake1:
i.p. administration of 3–100 mg/kg b.w. had no effect
on food intake in mice and rats. On the contrary, the
induction of hyperphagia by CB1 and 5HT1A agonists
in rats could be decreased with CBD (20 mg/kg b.w.
i.p.). Chronic administration (14 days, 2.5 or 5 mg/
kg i.p.) reduced the weight gain in rats. This effect
could be inhibited by coadministration of a CB2R
antagonist.1
The positive effects of CBD on hyperglycemia seem
to be mainly mediated via CBD anti-inflammatory
and antioxidant effects. For instance, in ob/ob mice
(an animal model of obesity), 4-week treatment with
3 mg/kg (route of administration was not mentioned)
increased the HDL-C concentration by 55% and re-
duced total cholesterol levels by more than 25%. In
addition, treatment increased adiponectin and liver
glycogen concentrations.44 and references therein
Endocrine effects
High CBD concentrations (1 mM) inhibited progester-
one 17-hydroxylase, which creates precursors for sex
steroid and glucocorticoid synthesis, whereas 100 lM
CBD did not in an in vitro experiment with primary
testis
microsomes.45
Rats
treated
with
10 mg/kg
i.p. b.w. CBD showed inhibition of testosterone oxida-
tion in the liver.46
Genotoxicity and mutagenicity
Jones et al. mention that 120 mg/kg CBD delivered
intraperetonially to Wistar Kyoto rats showed no mu-
tagenicity and genotoxicity based on personal commu-
nication with GW Pharmaceuticals47,48 These data are
yet to be published. The 2012 study with an epilepsy
mouse model could also show that CBD did not influ-
ence grip strength, which the study describes as a ‘‘pu-
tative test for functional neurotoxicity.’’48
Motor function was also tested on a rotarod, which
was also not affected by CBD administration. Static
beam performance, as an indicator of sensorimotor co-
ordination, showed more footslips in the CBD group,
but CBD treatment did not interfere with the animals’
speed and ability to complete the test. Compared to
other anticonvulsant drugs, this effect was minimal.48
Unfortunately, we could not find more studies solely
focusing on genotoxicity by other research groups nei-
ther in animals nor in humans.
Acute Clinical Data
Bergamaschi et al. list an impressive number of acute
and chronic studies in humans, showing CBD safety
for a wide array of side effects.1 They also conclude
from their survey, that none of the studies reported

 tolerance to CBD. Already in the 1970s, it was shown
that oral CBD (15–160 mg), iv injection (5–30 mg),
and inhalation of 0.15 mg/kg b.w. CBD did not lead
to adverse effects. In addition, psychomotor function
and psychological functions were not disturbed.
Treatment with up to 600 mg CBD neither influenced
physiological parameters (blood pressure, heart rate)
nor performance on a verbal paired-associate learn-
ing test.1
Fasinu et al. created a table with an overview of clin-
ical studies currently underway, registered in Clinical
Trials. gov.49 In the following chapter, we highlight re-
cent, acute clinical studies with CBD.
CBD-drug interactions
CBD can inhibit CYP2D6, which is also targeted by ome-
prazole and risperidone.2,14 There are also indications
that CBD inhibits the hepatic enzyme CYP2C9, reduc-
ing the metabolization of warfarin and diclofenac.2,14
More clinical studies are needed, to check whether this
interaction warrants an adaption of the used doses of
the coadministered drugs.
The antibiotic rifampicin induces CYP3A4, leading to
reduced CBD peak plasma concentrations.14 In contrast,
the CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole, an antifungal drug,
almost doubles CBD peak plasma concentration. Inter-
estingly, the CYP2C19 inhibitor omeprazole, used to
treat gastroesophageal reflux, could not significantly af-
fect the pharmacokinetics of CBD.14
A study, where a regimen of 6 · 100 mg CBD daily
was coadministered with hexobarbital in 10 subjects,
found that CBD increased the bioavailability and elim-
ination half-time of the latter. Unfortunately, it was not
mentioned whether this effect was mediated via the cy-
tochrome P450 complex.16
Another aspect, which has not been thoroughly
looked at, to our knowledge, is that several cytochrome
isozymes are not only expressed in the liver but also in
the brain. It might be interesting to research organ-
specific differences in the level of CBD inhibition of
various isozymes. Apart from altering the bioavailability
in the overall plasma of the patient, this interaction
might alter therapeutic outcomes on another level. Dop-
amine and tyramine are metabolized by CYP2D6, and
neurosteroid metabolism also occurs via the isozymes
of the CYP3A subgroup.50,51 Studying CBD interaction
with neurovascular cytochrome P450 enzymes might
also offer new mechanisms of action. It could be possible
that CBD-mediated CYP2D6 inhibition increases dopa-
mine levels in the brain, which could help to explain the
positive CBD effects in addiction/withdrawal scenarios
and might support its 5HT (=serotonin) elevating effect
in depression.
Also, CBD can be a substrate of UDP glucuronosyl-
transferase.14 Whether this enzyme is indeed involved
in the glucuronidation of CBD and also causes clini-
cally relevant drug interactions in humans is yet to be
determined
in
clinical
studies.
Generally,
more
human studies, which monitor CBD-drug interactions,
are needed.
Physiological effects
In a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study,
CBD was coadministered with intravenous fentanyl to
a total of 17 subjects.10 Blood samples were obtained
before and after 400 mg CBD (previously demon-
strated to decrease blood flow to (para)limbic areas
related to drug craving) or 800 mg CBD pretreatment.
This was followed by a single 0.5 (Session 1) or 1.0lg/kg
(Session 2, after 1 week of first administration to allow
for sufficient drug washout) intravenous fentanyl dose.
Adverse effects and safety were evaluated with both
forms of the Systematic Assessment for Treatment
Emergent Events (SAFTEE). This extensive tool tests,
for example, 78 adverse effects divided into 23 catego-
ries corresponding to organ systems or body parts. The
SAFTEE outcomes were similar between groups. No
respiratory depression or cardiovascular complications
were recorded during any test session.
The results of the evaluation of pharmacokinetics, to
see if interaction between the drugs occurred, were as
follows. Peak CBD plasma concentrations of the 400
and 800 mg group were measured after 4 h in the first
session (CBD administration 2 h after light breakfast).
Peak urinary CBD and its metabolite concentrations
occurred after 6 h in the low CBD group and after 4 h
in the high CBD group. No effect was evident for uri-
nary CBD and metabolite excretion except at the
higher fentanyl dose, in which CBD clearance was re-
duced. Importantly, fentanyl coadministration did
not produce respiratory depression or cardiovascular
complications during the test sessions and CBD did
not potentiate fentanyl’s effects. No correlation was
found between CBD dose and plasma cortisol levels.
Various vital signs were also measured (blood pres-
sure, respiratory/heart rate, oxygen saturation, EKG,
respiratory function): CBD did not worsen the adverse
effects (e.g., cardiovascular compromise, respiratory
depression) of iv fentanyl. Coadministration was safe
and well tolerated, paving the way to use CBD as a

 potential treatment for opioid addiction. The validated
subjective measures scales Anxiety (visual analog scale
[VAS]), PANAS (positive and negative subscores), and
OVAS (specific opiate VAS) were administered across
eight time points for each session without any signifi-
cant main effects for CBD for any of the subjective ef-
fects on mood.10
A Dutch study compared subjective adverse effects
of three different strains of medicinal cannabis, dis-
tributed via pharmacies, using VAS. ‘‘Visual analog
scale is one of the most frequently used psychometric
instruments to measure the extent and nature of sub-
jective effects and adverse effects. The 12 adjectives
used for this study were as follows: alertness, tranquil-
ity, confidence, dejection, dizziness, confusion/disori-
entation, fatigue, anxiety, irritability, appetite, creative
stimulation, and sociability.’’ The high CBD strain
contained the following concentrations: 6% D9-
THC/7.5% CBD (n = 25). This strain showed signifi-
cantly lower levels of anxiety and dejection. Moreover,
appetite increased less in the high CBD strain. The
biggest observed adverse effect was ‘‘fatigue’’ with a
score of 7 (out of 10), which did not differ between
the three strains.52
Neurological and neurospychiatric effects
Anxiety.
Forty-eight participants received subanxio-
lytic levels (32 mg) of CBD, either before or after the
extinction phase in a double-blind, placebo-controlled
design of a Pavlovian fear-conditioning experiment
(recall with conditioned stimulus and context after
48 h and exposure to unconditioned stimulus after re-
instatement). Skin conductance (=autonomic response
to conditioning) and shock expectancy measures (=ex-
plicit aspects) of conditioned responding were recorded
throughout. Among other scales, the Mood Rating
Scale (MRS) and the Bond and Bodily Symptoms
Scale were used to assess anxiety, current mood, and
physical symptoms. ‘‘CBD given postextinction (active
after consolidation phase) enhanced consolidation of
extinction learning as assessed by shock expectancy.’’
Apart from the extinction-enhancing effects of CBD
in human aversive conditioned memory, CBD showed
a trend toward some protection against reinstatement
of contextual memory. No side/adverse effects were
reported.53
Psychosis.
The review by Bergamaschi et al. mentions
three acute human studies that have demonstrated the
CBD antipsychotic effect without any adverse effects
being observed. This holds especially true for the extra-
pyramidal motor side effects elicited by classical anti-
psychotic medication.1
Fifteen male, healthy subjects with minimal prior
D9-THC exposure (<15 times) were tested for CBD af-
fecting D9-THC propsychotic effects using functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and various ques-
tionnaires on three occasions, at 1-month intervals,
following administration of 10 mg delta-9-D9-THC,
600 mg CBD, or placebo. Order of drug administration
was pseudorandomized across subjects, so that an
equal number of subjects received any of the drugs dur-
ing the first, second, or third session in a double-blind,
repeated-measures, within-subject design.54 No CBD ef-
fect on psychotic symptoms as measured with PANSS
positive symptoms subscale, anxiety as indexed by the
State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) state, and Visual
Analogue Mood Scale (VAMS) tranquilization or
calming subscale, compared to the placebo group,
was observed. The same is true for a verbal learning
task (=behavioral performance of the verbal memory).
Moreover, pretreatment with CBD and subsequent
D9-THC administration could reduce the latter’s psy-
chotic and anxiety symptoms, as measured using a
standardized scale. This effect was caused by opposite
neural activation of relevant brain areas. In addition,
no effects on peripheral cardiovascular measures such
as heart rate and blood pressure were measured.54
A randomized, double-blind, crossover, placebo-
controlled trial was conducted in 16 healthy non-
anxious subjects using a within-subject design. Oral
D9-THC = 10 mg, CBD = 600 mg, or placebo was ad-
ministered in three consecutive sessions at 1-month
intervals. The doses were selected to only evoke neuro-
cognitive effects without causing severe toxic, physical,
or psychiatric reactions. The 600 mg CBD corre-
sponded to mean (standard deviation) whole blood lev-
els of 0.36 (0.64), 1.62 (2.98), and 3.4 (6.42) ng/mL, 1, 2,
and 3 h after administration, respectively.
Physiological measures and symptomatic effects
were assessed before, and at 1, 2, and 3 h postdrug ad-
ministration using PANSS (a 30-item rating instru-
ment used to assess psychotic symptoms, with ratings
based on a semistructured clinical interview yielding
subscores for positive, negative, and general psychopa-
thology domains), the self-administered VAMS with 16
items (e.g., mental sedation or intellectual impairment,
physical sedation or bodily impairments, anxiety effects
and other types of feelings or attitudes), the ARCI (Addic-
tion Research Center Inventory; containing empirically

 derived drug-induced euphoria; stimulant-like effects;
intellectual efficiency and energy; sedation; dysphoria;
and somatic effects) to assess drug effects and the
STAI-T/S, where subjects were evaluated on their cur-
rent mood and their feelings in general.
There were no significant differences between the ef-
fects of CBD and placebo on positive and negative psy-
chotic symptoms, general psychopathology (PANSS),
anxiety (STAI-S), dysphoria (ARCI), sedation (VAMS,
ARCI), and the level of subjective intoxication (ASI,
ARCI), where D9-THC did have a pronounced effect.
The physiological parameters, heart rate and blood pres-
sure, were also monitored and no significant difference
between the placebo and the CBD group was observed.55
Addiction.
A case study describes a patient treated for
cannabis withdrawal according to the following CBD
regimen: ‘‘treated with oral 300 mg on Day 1; CBD
600 mg on Days 2–10 (divided into two doses of
300 mg), and CBD 300 mg on Day 11.’’ CBD treatment
resulted in a fast and progressive reduction in with-
drawal, dissociative and anxiety symptoms, as mea-
sured with the Withdrawal Discomfort Score, the
Marijuana
Withdrawal
Symptom
Checklist,
Beck
Anxiety Inventory, and Beck Depression Inventory
(BDI). Hepatic enzymes were also measured daily,
but no effect was reported.56
Naturalistic studies with smokers inhaling cannabis
with varying amounts of CBD showed that the CBD
levels were not altering psychomimetic symptoms.1
Interestingly, CBD was able to reduce the ‘‘wanting/
liking’’ = implicit attentional bias caused by exposure
to cannabis and food-related stimuli. CBD might
work to alleviate disorders of addiction, by altering
the attentive salience of drug cues. The study did not
further measure side effects.57
CBD can also reduce heroin-seeking behaviors (e.g.,
induced by a conditioned cue). This was shown in the
preclinical data mentioned earlier and was also repli-
cated in a small double-blind pilot study with individu-
als addicted to opioids, who have been abstinent for
7 days.52,53 They either received placebo or 400 or
800 mg oral CBD on three consecutive days. Craving
was induced with a cue-induced reinstatement para-
digm (1 h after CBD administration). One hour after
the video session, subjective craving was already reduced
after a single CBD administration. The effect persisted
for 7 days after the last CBD treatment. Interestingly,
anxiety measures were also reduced after treatment,
whereas no adverse effects were described.23,58
A pilot study with 24 subjects was conducted in a
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design
to evaluate the impact of the ad hoc use of CBD
in smokers, who wished to stop smoking. Pre- and
post-testing for mood and craving of the participants
was executed. These tests included the Behaviour
Impulsivity Scale, BDI, STAI, and the Severity of
Dependence Scale. During the week of CBD inhalator
use, subjects used a diary to log their craving (on
a scale from 1 to 100 = VAS measuring momentary
subjective craving), the cigarettes smoked, and the
number of times they used the inhaler. Craving was
assessed using the Tiffany Craving Questionnaire
(11). On day 1 and 7, exhaled CO was measured to
test smoking status. Sedation, depression, and anxiety
were evaluated with the MRS.
Over the course of 1 week, participants used the in-
haler when they felt the urge to smoke and received a
dose of 400 lg CBD via the inhaler (leading to >65%
bioavailability); this significantly reduced the number
of cigarettes smoked by ca. 40%, while craving was
not significantly different in the groups post-test. At
day 7, the anxiety levels for placebo and CBD group
did not differ. CBD did not increase depression (in
contrast to the selective CB1 antagonist rimonabant).
CBD might weaken the attentional bias to smoking
cues or could have disrupted reconsolidation, thereby
destabilizing drug-related memories.59
Cell migration
According to our literature survey, there currently are
no studies about CBD role in embryogenesis/cell mi-
gration in humans, even though cell migration does
play a role in embryogenesis and CBD was shown
to be able to at least influence migratory behavior in
cancer.1
Endocrine effects and glycemic (including appetite)
effects
To the best of our knowledge, no acute studies
were performed that solely concentrated on CBD
glycemic effects. Moreover, the only acute study
that also measured CBD effect on appetite was the
study we described above, comparing different can-
nabis strains. In this study, the strain high in CBD
elicited less appetite increase compared to the THC-
only strain.52
Eleven healthy volunteers were treated with 300 mg
(seven patients) and 600 mg (four patients) oral CBD
in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Growth

 hormone and prolactin levels were unchanged. In con-
trast, the normal decrease of cortisol levels in the morn-
ing (basal measurement = 11.0– 3.7 lg/dl; 120 min after
placebo= 7.1– 3.9 lg/dl) was inhibited by CBD treat-
ment (basal measurement = 10.5– 4.9 lg/dl; 120 min
after
300 mg
CBD = 9.9 – 6.2 lg/dl;
120 min
after
600 mg CBD = 11.6– 11.6 lg/dl).60
A more recent study also used 600 mg oral CBD for a
week and compared 24 healthy subjects to people at
risk for psychosis (n = 32; 16 received placebo and 16
CBD). Serum cortisol levels were taken before the
TSST (Trier Social Stress Test), immediately after, as
well as 10 and 20 min after the test. Compared to the
healthy individuals, the cortisol levels increased less
after TSST in the 32 at-risk individuals. The CBD
group showed less reduced cortisol levels but differ-
ences were not significant.61 It has to be mentioned
that these data were presented at a conference and
are not yet published (to our knowledge) in a peer-
reviewed journal.
Chronic CBD Studies in Humans
Truly chronic studies with CBD are still scarce. One
can often argue that what the studies call ‘‘chronic’’
CBD administration only differs to acute treatment, be-
cause of repeated administration of CBD. Nonetheless,
we also included these studies with repeated CBD treat-
ment, because we think that compared to a one-time
dose of CBD, repeated CBD regimens add value and
knowledge to the field and therefore should be men-
tioned here.
CBD-drug interactions
An 8-week-long clinical study, including 13 children
who were treated for epilepsy with clobazam (initial av-
erage dose of 1 mg/kg b.w.) and CBD (oral; starting
dose of 5 mg/kg b.w. raised to maximum of 25 mg/kg
b.w.), showed the following. The CBD interaction
with isozymes CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 caused in-
creased clobazam bioavailability, making it possible to
reduce the dose of the antiepileptic drug, which in
turn reduced its side effects.62
These results are supported by another study de-
scribed in the review by Grotenhermen et al.63 In this
study, 33 children were treated with a daily dose
of 5 mg/kg CBD, which was increased every week
by 5 mg/kg increments, up to a maximum level of
25 mg/kg. CBD was administered on average with
three other drugs, including clobazam (54.5%), val-
proic acid (36.4%), levetiracetam (30.3%), felbamate
(21.2%),
lamotrigine
(18.2%),
and
zonisamide
(18.2%). The coadministration led to an alteration of
blood levels of several antiepileptic drugs. In the case
of clobazam this led to sedation, and its levels were sub-
sequently lowered in the course of the study.
Physiological effects
A first pilot study in healthy volunteers in 1973 by Min-
cis et al. administering 10 mg oral CBD for 21 days did
not find any neurological and clinical changes (EEG;
EKG).64 The same holds true for psychiatry and
blood and urine examinations. A similar testing battery
was performed in 1980, at weekly intervals for 30 days
with daily oral CBD administration of 3 mg/kg b.w.,
which had the same result.65
Neurological and neuropsychiatric effects
Anxiety.
Clinical chronic (lasting longer than a couple
of weeks) studies in humans are crucial here but were
mostly still lacking at the time of writing this review.
They hopefully will shed light on the inconsistencies
observerd in animal studies. Chronic studies in humans
may, for instance, help to test whether, for example, an
anxiolytic effect always prevails after chronic CBD treat-
ment or whether this was an artifact of using different
animal models of anxiety or depression.2,18
Psychosis and bipolar disorder.
In a 4-week open
trial, CBD was tested on Parkinson’s patients with psy-
chotic symptoms. Oral doses of 150–400 mg/day CBD
(in the last week) were administered. This led to a re-
duction of their psychotic symptoms. Moreover, no se-
rious side effects or cognitive and motor symptoms
were reported.66
Bergamaschi et al. describe a chronic study, where a
teenager with severe side effects of traditional antipsy-
chotics was treated with up to 1500 mg/day of CBD for
4 weeks. No adverse effects were observed and her
symptoms improved. The same positive outcome was
registered in another study described by Bergamaschi
et al., where three patients were treated with a starting
dose of CBD of 40 mg, which was ramped up to
1280 mg/day for 4 weeks.1 A double-blind, randomized
clinical trial of CBD versus amisulpride, a potent anti-
psychotic in acute schizophrenia, was performed on a
total of 42 subjects, who were treated for 28 days start-
ing with 200 mg CBD per day each.67 The dose was in-
creased stepwise by 200 mg per day to 4 · 200 mg
CBD daily (total 800 mg per day) within the first
week. The respective treatment was maintained for

 three additional weeks. A reduction of each treatment
to 600 mg per day was allowed for clinical reasons,
such as unwanted side effects after week 2. This was
the case for three patients in the CBD group and five
patients in the amisulpride group. While both treat-
ments were effective (no significant difference in
PANSS total score), CBD showed the better side effect
profile. Amisulpride, working as a dopamine D2/D3-
receptor antagonist, is one of the most effective treat-
ment options for schizophrenia. CBD treatment was
accompanied by a substantial increase in serum anan-
damide levels, which was significantly associated with
clinical improvement, suggesting inhibition of ananda-
mide deactivation via reduced FAAH activity.
In addition, the FAAH substrates palmitoylethano-
lamide and linoleoyl-ethanolamide (both lipid media-
tors) were also elevated in the CBD group. CBD
showed less serum prolactin increase (predictor of gal-
actorrhoea and sexual dysfunction), fewer extrapyra-
midal symptoms measured with the Extrapyramidal
Symptom Scale, and less weight gain. Moreover, elec-
trocardiograms as well as routine blood parameters
were other parameters whose effects were measured
but not reported in the study. CBD better safety profile
might improve acute compliance and long-term treat-
ment adherence.67,68
A press release by GW Pharmaceuticals of Septem-
ber 15th, 2015, described 88 patients with treatment-
resistant schizophrenic psychosis, treated either with
CBD (in addition to their regular medication) or pla-
cebo. Important clinical parameters improved in the
CBD group and the number of mild side effects was
comparable to the placebo group.2 Table 2 shows an
overview of studies with CBD for the treatment of psy-
chotic symptoms and its positive effect on symptom-
atology and the absence of side effects.69
Treatment of two patients for 24 days with 600–
1200 mg/day CBD, who were suffering from BD, did
not lead to side effects.70 Apart from the study with
two patients mentioned above, CBD has not been
tested systematically in acute or chronic administration
scenarios in humans for BD according to our own lit-
erature search.71
Epilepsy.
Epileptic patients were treated for 135 days
with 200–300 mg oral CBD daily and evaluated every
week for changes in urine and blood. Moreover, neuro-
logical and physiological examinations were per-
formed, which neither showed signs of CBD toxicity
nor severe side effects. The study also illustrated that
CBD was well tolerated.65
A review by Grotenhermen and Mu
¨ller-Vahl de-
scribes several clinical studies with CBD2: 23 patients
with therapy-resistant epilepsy (e.g., Dravet syndrome)
were treated for 3 months with increasing doses of up
to 25 mg/kg b.w. CBD in addition to their regular epi-
lepsy medication. Apart from reducing the seizure fre-
quency in 39% of the patients, the side effects were only
mild to moderate and included reduced/increased ap-
petite, weight gain/loss, and tiredness.
Another clinical study lasting at least 3 months with
137 children and young adults with various forms of
epilepsy, who were treated with the CBD drug Epi-
diolex, was presented at the American Academy for
Neurology in 2015. The patients were suffering from
Dravet syndrome (16%), Lennox–Gastaut syndrome
(16%), and 10 other forms of epilepsy (some among
them were very rare conditions). In this study, almost

 50% of the patients experienced a reduction of seizure
frequency. The reported side effects were 21% experi-
enced tiredness, 17% diarrhea, and 16% reduced appe-
tite. In a few cases, severe side effects occurred, but it
is not clear, if these were caused by Epidiolex. These
were status epilepticus (n = 10), diarrhea (n = 3),
weight loss (n = 2), and liver damage in one case.
The largest CBD study conducted thus far was an

children, the average age of the participants was 11)

ted sufficiently with standard medication. After 3
months of treatment, where patients received CBD to-
gether with their regular medication, a median reduc-
tion of seizure frequency of 45% was observed. Ten
percent of the patients reported side effects (tiredness,
diarrhea, and exhaustion).2
After extensive literature study of the available trials
performed until September 2016, CBD side effects were
generally mild and infrequent. The only exception
seems to be a multicenter open-label study with a
total of 162 patients aged 1–30 years, with treatment-
resistant epilepsy. Subjects were treated for 1 year
with a maximum of 25 mg/kg (in some clinics 50 mg/
kg) oral CBD, in addition to their standard medication.
This led to a reduction in seizure frequency. In this
study, 79% of the cohort experienced side effects. The
three most common adverse effects were somnolence
(n = 41 [25%]), decreased appetite (n = 31 [19%]), and
diarrhea (n = 31 [19%]).72 It has to be pointed out
that no control group existed in this study (e.g., placebo
or another drug). It is therefore difficult to put the side
effect frequency into perspective. Attributing the side
effects to CBD is also not straightforward in severely
sick patients. Thus, it is not possible to draw reliable
conclusions on the causation of the observed side ef-
fects in this study.
Parkinson’s disease.
In a study with a total of 21 Par-
kinson’s patients (without comorbid psychiatric condi-
tions or dementia) who were treated with either
placebo, 75 mg/day CBD or 300 mg/day CBD in an ex-
ploratory double-blind trial for 6 weeks, the higher
CBD dose showed significant improvement of quality
of life, as measured with PDQ-39. This rating instru-
ment comprised the following factors: mobility, activi-
ties of daily living, emotional well-being, stigma, social
support, cognition, communication, and bodily dis-
comfort. For the factor, ‘‘activities of daily living,’’ a
possible dose-dependent relationship could exist be-
tween the low and high CBD group—the two CBD
groups scored significantly different here. Side effects
were evaluated with the UKU (Udvalg for Kliniske
Undersøgelser). This assessment instrument analyzes
adverse medication effects, including psychic, neuro-
logic, autonomic, and other manifestations. Using the
UKU and verbal reports, no significant side effects
were recognized in any of the CBD groups.73
Huntington’s disease.
Fifteen neuroleptic-free pa-
tients with Huntington’s disease were treated with ei-
ther placebo or oral CBD (10 mg/kg b.w. per day) for
6 weeks in a double-blind, randomized, crossover
study design. Using various safety outcome variables,
clinical tests, and the cannabis side effect inventory, it
was shown that there were no differences between the
placebo group and the CBD group in the observed
side effects.6
Immune system
Forty-eight patients were treated with 300 mg/kg oral
CBD, 7 days before and until 30 days after the trans-
plantation of allogeneic hematopoietic cells from an
unrelated donor to treat acute leukemia or myelodys-
plastic syndrome in combination with standard mea-
sures
to
avoid
GVHD
(graft
vs.
host
disease;
cyclosporine and short course of MTX). The occur-
rence of various degrees of GVHD was compared
with historical data from 108 patients, who had only re-
ceived the standard treatment. Patients treated with
CBD did not develop acute GVHD. In the 16 months
after transplantation, the incidence of GHVD was sig-
nificantly reduced in the CBD group. Side effects were
graded using the Common Terminology Criteria for
Adverse Events (CTCAE v4.0) classification, which
did not detect severe adverse effects.74
Endocrine and glycemic (including appetite, weight
gain) effects
In a placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind
study with 62 subjects with noninsulin-treated type 2
diabetes, 13 patients were treated with twice-daily
oral doses of 100 mg CBD for 13 weeks. This resulted
in lower resistin levels compared to baseline. The hor-
mone resistin is associated with obesity and insulin re-
sistance. Compared to baseline, glucose-dependent
insulinotropic peptide levels were elevated after CBD
treatment. This incretin hormone is produced in the
proximal duodenum by K cells and has insulinotropic
and pancreatic b cell preserving effects. CBD was well

 tolerated in the patients. However, with the compara-
tively low CBD concentrations used in this phase-2-
trial, no overall improvement of glycemic control was
observed.40
When weight and appetite were measured as part of a
measurement battery for side effects, results were incon-
clusive. For instance, the study mentioned above, where
23 children with Dravet syndrome were treated, in-
creases as well as decreases in appetite and weight
were observed as side effects.2 An open-label trial with
214 patients suffering from treatment-resistant epilepsy
showed decreased appetite in 32 cases. However, in the
safety analysis group, consisting of 162 subjects, 10
showed decreased weight and 12 had gained weight.52
This could be either due to the fact that CBD only has
a small effect on these factors, or appetite and weight
are complex endpoints influenced by multiple factors
such as diet and genetic predisposition. Both these fac-
tors were not controlled for in the reviewed studies.
Conclusion
This review could substantiate and expand the findings
of Bergamaschi et al. about CBD favorable safety pro-
file.1 Nonetheless, various areas of CBD research
should be extended. First, more studies researching
CBD side effects after real chronic administration
need to be conducted. Many so-called chronic admin-
istration studies, cited here were only a couple of weeks
long. Second, many trials were conducted with a small
number of individuals only. To perform a throrough
general safety evaluation, more individuals have to be
recruited into future clinical trials. Third, several as-
pects of a toxicological evaluation of a compound
such as genotoxicity studies and research evaluating
CBD effect on hormones are still scarce. Especially,
chronic studies on CBD effect on, for example, geno-
toxicity and the immune system are still missing.
Last, studies that evaluate whether CBD-drug interac-
tions occur in clinical trials have to be performed.
In conclusion, CBD safety profile is already estab-
lished in a plethora of ways. However, some knowledge
gaps detailed above should be closed by additional clin-
ical trials to have a completely well-tested pharmaceu-
tical compound.
