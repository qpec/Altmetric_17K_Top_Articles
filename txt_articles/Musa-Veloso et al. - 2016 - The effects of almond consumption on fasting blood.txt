Abstract
A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials was undertaken to determine the effects of almond consumption on blood lipid
levels, namely total cholesterol (TC), LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C), HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C), TAG and the ratios of TC:HDL-C and LDL-C:HDL-C.
Following a comprehensive search of the scientific literature, a total of eighteen relevant publications and twenty-seven almond-control datasets were iden-
tified. Across the studies, the mean differences in the effect for each blood lipid parameter (i.e. the control-adjusted values) were pooled in a meta-analysis
using a random-effects model. It was determined that TC, LDL-C and TAG were significantly reduced by −0·153 mmol/l (P < 0·001), −0·124 mmol/l
(P = 0·001) and −0·067 mmol/l (P = 0·042), respectively, and that HDL-C was not affected (−0·017 mmol/l; P = 0·207). These results are aligned with
data from prospective observational studies and a recent large-scale intervention study in which it was demonstrated that the consumption of nuts reduces
the risk of heart disease. The consumption of nuts as part of a healthy diet should be encouraged to help in the maintenance of healthy blood lipid levels
and to reduce the risk of heart disease.
Key words: Almonds: Blood lipids: Cholesterol: TAG
Almonds are nutritionally dense(1). According to compositional
data from the United States Department of Agriculture, 100 g of
raw, unroasted almonds provides 2423 kJ (579 kcal), 50 g of fat,
13 g of insoluble dietary fibre and 21 g of protein(2). There is
some natural variability in the composition of almonds in terms
of the fat and fatty acid contents; when expressed on a per 100 g
basis, almonds contain about 45 to 54 g of fat, with
relative
amounts of PUFA, MUFA and SFA of 9 to 15, 25 to 36, and
3to5 g,respectively(1).Inaddition,almondscontainsmallamounts
of plant sterols(3–5), and are sources or high sources of several
minerals and vitamins (i.e. Ca, Fe, Mg, P, K, Zn, Cu, Mg, thiamin,
riboflavin, niacin and vitamin E), according to therequirements for
nutrition claims, as set out in Regulation EC 1924/2006(6).
Several of the compositional attributes of almonds are ideal
for the maintenance of healthy blood lipid levels. Indeed, in a
meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials, Phung et al.(7)
reported that almond consumption was associated with a
significant reduction in total cholesterol (TC) (−0·18 mmol/
l; 95 % CI −0·34, −0·02 mmol/l), as well as a strong trend
toward a reduction in LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) (−0·15
mmol/l; 95 % CI −0·29, 0·00 mmol/l). No effects on
HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C), TAG, or on the ratio of LDL-
C:HDL-C were observed. The meta-analysis by Phung
et al.(7) was based on five randomised controlled studies
(representing a total of 142 participants). More than 7 years
have elapsed since Phung et al.(7) conducted their literature
search; thus, all randomised controlled trials that have since
been published were identified, and, using the totality of
evidence, the effects of almonds on blood lipid levels were
re-evaluated.

 Methods
Literature search
The systematic review was conducted in accordance with the
guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic
Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement.
In May 2013, the electronic search tool Dialog™ was used
to search eight literature databases (Allied & Complementary
Medicine™, Adis Clinical Trials Insight, CAB Abstracts,
Elsevier Biobase, EMBASE®, Foodline®: Science, Medline®,
and National Technical Information Service). Dialog™ was
subsequently replaced by ProQuest Dialog™, which did not
index one of the eight original literature databases that were
searched (i.e. Elsevier Biobase). Updated literature searches
were conducted in May 2014 and in February 2015, using
ProQuestDialog™toaccesssevenoftheeightoriginal databases.
The search terms used reflected the exposure (‘almond’,
‘Prunus amygdalus’, ‘P. amygdalus’, ‘Prunus dulcis’, ‘P. dulcis’) and
the study population (‘human’, ‘subject’, ‘participant’, ‘volun-
teer’, ‘patient’, ‘elder*’, ‘senior’, ‘geriatric’, ‘adult’, ‘men’,
‘women’, ‘man’, ‘woman’, ‘teen*’, ‘adolescen*’, ‘people’, ‘per-
son’, ‘individual’), and were required to appear in the titles
or abstracts of the articles. The literature searches were
restricted to studies conducted in humans; that is, the key-
words used to limit the searches to human studies (‘animal’,
‘rodent’, ‘rat’, ‘mouse’, ‘mice’, ‘dog’, ‘pig’, ‘rabbit’, ‘hamster’,
‘monkey’, ‘in vitro’, ‘ex vivo’) were required not to appear in
the descriptor or subject field of the records. No restrictions
with respect to the health outcomes of interest or language
were imposed on any of the literature searches. As well, no
restriction on the year of publication was imposed on the
first literature search.
Inclusion/exclusion criteria
The following inclusion criteria were applied: (1) a human
intervention study that was randomised and controlled (such
that the control group/phase could have consisted of either
no food or any food(s) without tree nuts or fractions of tree
nuts); (2) a full-length article that was published in a peer-
reviewed journal; (3) the objective of the study (either primary
or secondary) was to assess the effects of almond consump-
tion on blood lipid levels; (4) the amount of almonds con-
sumed was reported; (5) the subjects were adults (aged ≥18
years of age) without serious disease such as heart disease; (6)
the study duration was ≥4 weeks; (7) fasting blood lipids (i.e.
TC, LDL-C, HDL-C and/or TAG) were assessed; and (8) fast-
ing blood lipids were measured using validated methods.
The following exclusion criteria were applied: (1) the publi-
cation was of a secondary research study (e.g. systematic re-
view or meta-analysis); (2) the objective of the study (either
primary or secondary) was not to assess the effects of almond
consumption on blood lipid levels; (3) the subjects had a ser-
ious disease (e.g. heart disease, cancer) and were not represen-
tative of the general population; (4) the subjects were children
or pregnant or lactating women; (5) control-adjusted effects on
blood lipids could not be calculated from the data provided;
(6) the independent effects of almonds on blood lipid levels
could not be isolated (e.g. almonds were co-consumed with
other nuts or another nutritional or pharmaceutical interven-
tion); and (7) the study results for the same population
group were published in another journal (i.e. the study was a
kin publication to another study).
Data extraction and study quality
Study data were extracted independently by two reviewers
(T. P. and H. Y. L.), and the consistency of the two datasets
was verified by a third reviewer (K. M. V.). Where there
were inconsistencies or discrepancies between the two data-
sets, the original publication was consulted, and a consensus
was reached via discussions between the three reviewers
(T. P., H. Y. L. and K. M. V.). Data extracted from the studies
included study design, country of study conduct, sample size,
study population (proportion of males, health status, mean
age, mean BMI, mean baseline blood lipid levels (i.e. TC,
LDL-C, HDL-C, TAG, TC:HDL-C; LDL-C:HDL-C)), dietary
interventions (dose, form of almonds, provision of foods or
meals, duration, frequency of intake, pattern of intake), back-
ground diets and macronutrient intakes, statistical results, and
the mean difference in the effect for each blood lipid param-
eter (see the Statistical analysis section for details on how the
mean difference in the effect was calculated for the crossover
and parallel studies).
Health Canada’s standardised quality appraisal tool(8) was
used to determine the quality of the studies. A quantitative
score (zero or one) was assigned to each of the fifteen items
included in the tool, and studies with scores of ≥8/15 were
considered to be ‘higher quality’ while studies with scores of
≤7/15 were considered to be ‘lower quality’. Study quality
was appraised by one reviewer (L. P.).
Statistical analysis
Several of the identified studies had multiple comparisons
(e.g. one study may have had three arms, including one control
and two different almond doses). Each almond-control com-
parison, hereinafter referred to as a stratum, was considered
a separate trial; however, the control sample size was divided
evenly amongst the comparisons so as to avoid inflating the
weight of each stratum. For parallel studies, the mean differ-
ence in the effect for each blood lipid parameter was calculated
as the change from baseline in the control group subtracted
from the change from baseline in the almond group. For
crossover studies, the mean difference in the effect for each
blood lipid parameter was calculated as the blood lipid value
at the end of the control phase subtracted from the blood
lipid value at the end of the almond phase.
In order to determine the effects of almonds on each of the
blood lipid parameters, the results of the studies were pooled
in a meta-analysis, with the mean difference in the effect and
the inverse of the variance used as the weighting factor. In the
majority of the studies, variances for the mean differences
were not reported; thus, variances were calculated using infor-
mation provided in the publication (e.g. using CI or individual
variances for the almond and control groups). If, in parallel

 studies, variances for the changes from baseline were reported
separately for the almond and control groups, then a pooled
variance for the mean difference was calculated. If, for parallel
studies, variances only for the baseline and end of treatment
values were reported, then these were used to calculate the
variance for the change from baseline, using a correlation co-
efficient of 0·8. Similarly, for crossover studies, if variances
only for the end of treatment values were reported, then the
variance for the mean difference was calculated using a correl-
ation coefficient of 0·8. A correlation coefficient of 0·8 was
used because this value approximated that calculated from
the studies in which variances were provided for the baseline,
end of treatment, and change from baseline measures(9–11).
A random-effects model was used, according to the methods
described by DerSimonian & Laird(12), given that random-
effects models take into consideration the variability in re-
sponse both within and between studies.
The pooled estimates and accompanying 95 % CI were
determined using Comprehensive Meta-analysis Software (ver-
sion 2.2.064). Publication bias was assessed according to the
trim-and-fill method developed by Duval & Tweedie(13).
With this method, asymmetry in the funnel plot is searched
for. If the asymmetry is determined to be due to the presence
of small studies (with large variances) in which large effect
sizes were reported, with an unbalanced number of small stud-
ies showing a small effect, then those ‘missing’ studies are
imputed, and the pooled effect size is recalculated.
Subgroup analyses were conducted to evaluate the influence
of dose (i.e. <45 v. ≥45 g/d), study design (i.e. parallel or cross-
over), the control food/diet (i.e. whether it was provided or if
subjects were simply instructed to avoid nuts), the duration of
the study (i.e. ≥12 weeks v. 4 to <12 weeks (hereinafter referred
to as <12 weeks)), and of baseline blood lipid level. Baseline
blood lipid levels were categorised dichotomously as ‘optimal’
or ‘not optimal’, based on the targets established in the
National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment
Panel III guidelines (i.e. optimal blood lipid levels were defined
as: LDL-C < 2·59; TC < 5·17; HDL-C ≥ 1·03; TAG < 1·69
mmol/l). For crossover studies, the categorisation was based
on the reported baseline lipid level; for parallel studies, the cat-
egorisation was based on the average of the baseline lipid levels
that were reported for each group, weighted by the sample size
of each group. Subgroup analyses were conducted when there
were at least three strata available for pooling.
Results
Literature search results and overview of included studies
The three literature searches resulted in the identification of
1697 titles, of which eighteen publications met all of the inclu-
sion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria (Fig. 1).
The eighteen publications provided a total of twenty-seven
strata (Table 1). Of the twenty-seven strata, seventeen were
from parallel trials, and the remaining ten strata were from
crossover trials. The number of study completers ranged
from thirteen to 137 amongst the eighteen publications.
Both male and female subjects were studied in the majority
of the strata, with the exception of three strata wherein only
females were studied (Abazarfard et al.(9); Kurlandsky &
Stote strata 1 and 2(14)) and two strata wherein only males
were studied (Jia et al. strata 1 and 2(15)). The subjects were
described by the authors as generally healthy in seven strata
(Abazarfard et al.(9); Berryman et al.(11); Foster et al.(16);
Kurlandsky & Stote strata 1 and 2(14); Spiller et al. strata 1
and 2(17)), generally healthy but habitual smokers in two strata
(Jia et al. strata 1 and 2(15)), generally healthy or hyperlipidaemic
in two strata (Sabaté et al. strata 1 and 2(18)), hyperlipidaemic in
four strata (Damasceno et al.(19); Jenkins et al. strata 1 and 2(20);
Tamizifar et al.(21)), or pre-diabetic or at risk of type 2 diabetes
mellitus (T2DM) in five strata (Tan & Mattes strata 1 to 4(22);
Wien et al.(23)). In the remaining seven strata, medicated
subjects were studied, including subjects with T2DM on
oral hypoglycaemic therapy (Sweazea et al.(10); Cohen &
Johnston(24); Li et al.(25); Lovejoy et al. strata 1 and 2(26)),
subjects on stable statin therapy (Ruisinger et al.(27)), and sub-
jects on antihypertensive and/or antidiabetic medications
(Wien et al.(28)).
Almond interventions
Across all strata, the average daily intake of almonds ranged
from 20 to 113 g/d, and the duration of the almond consump-
tion period ranged from 4 weeks to 18 months. Almonds were
required to be consumed every day in all studies except two, in
which 28 g (1 oz) of almonds were required to be consumed 5 d
per week(24) or 43 g (1·5 oz) of almonds were required to be
consumed five to seven times weekly(10).
Whole, raw (unblanched, unsalted) almonds were consumed
in nine strata (Abazarfard et al.(9); Sweazea et al.(10); Damasceno
et al.(19); Jenkins et al. strata 1 and 2(20); Ruisinger et al.(27);
Spiller et al. strata 1 and 2(17); Wien et al.(28)). In five strata
(Cohen & Johnston(24); Tan & Mattes strata 1 to 4(22)), the
almonds that were consumed by the subjects were not specif-
ically described by the study authors as raw, unblanched
almonds; however, based on the reported energy value of
the almonds, it was determined that the almonds were most
probably raw, unblanched almonds. A variety of almonds,
namely whole (raw), roasted, and flavoured almonds were con-
sumed in one stratum (Foster et al.(16)); dry, roasted almonds
were consumed in one stratum (Wien et al.(23)); and almond
powder was consumed in one stratum (Tamizifar et al.(21)).
The types of almonds used were not specified in two strata
(Kurlandsky & Stote strata 1 and 2(14)). In eight strata, all
meals and snacks were provided and the almonds were said
to have been consumed as a snack (Berryman et al.(11) or
incorporated into the meals and snacks (Jia et al. strata 1 and
2(15); Li et al.(25); Lovejoy et al. strata 1 and 2(26); Sabaté et al.
strata 1 and 2(18)). The form of almonds that was used was
described only by Berryman et al.(11), who reported administer-
ing unsalted, whole, natural almonds with skins, and by Jia
et al. strata 1 and 2(15), who reported using almond powder.
In the remaining five strata in which all meals and snacks
were provided (Li et al.(25); Lovejoy et al. strata 1 and 2(26);
Sabaté et al. strata 1 and 2(18)), it is assumed that whole

 almonds, almond pieces and ground almonds were used to
prepare the meals.
Control foods/diets
Although all studies were randomised and controlled, the con-
trol food was not defined in some studies but defined in other
studies. In thirteen of the twenty-seven strata, subjects in the
control group or during the control phase were instructed
not to consume nuts, but were not provided with a control
food or with a control diet (Abazarfard et al.(9); Sweazea et al.(10);
Foster et al.(16); Kurlandsky & Stote strata 1 and 2(14);
Ruisinger et al.(27); Tamizifar et al.(21); Tan & Mattes strata 1
to 4(22); Wien et al.(28); Wien et al.(23)). In fourteen strata, either
a ‘control food’ (e.g. cheese sticks or a muffin or olive oil) was
provided (Cohen & Johnston(24); Damasceno et al. (19); Jenkins
et al. strata 1 and 2(20); Spiller et al. strata 1 and 2(17)), or the
entire control diet was provided (Berryman et al.(11); Jia et al.
strata 1 and 2(15); Li et al.(25); Lovejoy et al. strata 1 and 2(26);
Sabaté et al. strata 1 and 2(18)).
Study quality
Based on Health Canada’s quality appraisal tool, all of the
studies were considered to be ‘higher quality’(8). Across all
eighteen publications, the most commonly identified limita-
tions included the lack of reporting on allocation concealment
(n 16), the lack of reporting on the method of randomisation
and thus the ‘appropriateness’ of the randomisation method,
which also is a quality factor, could not be determined
(n 13), as well as the lack of reporting of an intent-to-treat
analysis (n 13).
Effects of almonds on fasting blood lipids
The fasting blood lipids that were assessed in each of the
twenty-seven strata, as well as other information pertinent to
the subgroup analyses (i.e. study design, almond intake,
whether a control food/diet was provided, study duration,
and baseline blood lipid levels), are summarised in Table 2.
In the study by Lovejoy et al. strata 1 and 2(26), baseline
TAG levels were not reported; thus, a determination as to

* For P studies, the weighted mean age/BMI and pooled SD were calculated by using the mean age/BMI and SD values that were reported separately for the individual groups.
† Subjects had not been prescribed insulin; rather, subjects were on stable oral hypoglycaemic therapy.
‡ In another arm of this trial, subjects were administered 40 to 65 g/d of walnuts; however, according to the study exclusion criteria, the control is not acceptable if it consists of another tree nut or any tree nut fraction. Thus, the results of the walnuts
intervention arm were excluded from the analysis.
§ Damasceno et al.(19) acknowledged that, given the nature of the foods provided, which could not be masked, the study was unblinded; however, it was noted that investigators involved in the preparation of databases and laboratory determinations
were masked with respect to treatment sequence.
║ The almonds partially replaced other MUFA-rich foods, such as olives and avocados.
¶ The Mediterranean-type, cholesterol-lowering diet was composed of natural foodstuffs. Vegetable products and fish were emphasised, while red and processed meats, whole-fat dairy products and eggs were limited. Recipes using nuts were
provided to the subjects who consumed the nuts with meals in desserts or salads or as snacks.
** During the first 5 weeks, subjects received whole, raw almonds only. From week 6, roasted almonds were introduced and, over time, a variety of isoenergetic, flavoured almonds were used.
†† The majority of the subjects were not medicated; however, 3 M and 5 F were taking the following medications: statins (n 2), β-blocking agents (n 3), ACE inhibitors (n 3), angiotensin II AT1 receptor blockers (n 1), thiazide diuretics (n 2),
levothyroxine (n 2) and HRT (n 2). Medication dosages were held constant throughout the study.
‡‡ Subjects did not use lipid-lowering medications or dietary supplements. Subjects were allowed to be on stable regimens of oral contraceptives and HRT.
§§ Subjects did not receive insulin therapy; rather, all subjects were on stable oral hypoglycaemic therapy.
║║ Almonds were incorporated into the control diet to replace 20 % of TDEI in the control diet; depending on the menus, almonds were either incorporated into entrées and desserts or consumed as a snack.
¶¶ In this study, subjects were provided with all foods needed for the duration of the study; since the study was crossover in design but described as DB, it is assumed that almond powder was used in the formulation of the entrées and snacks.
However, it remains unclear how true double-blinding was achieved, given that the subjects could have tasted the almonds in their foods (it is possible that the ‘control’ foods were flavoured with an almond extract; however, this was not described in
the publication).
*** Subjects on lipid-lowering or insulin therapy were excluded. Eleven F received HRT, and sixteen of the subjects were taking oral hypoglycaemic agents.
††† Regarding background diets, on weekdays, the subjects were required to consume breakfast and dinner under supervision at the Pennington Biomedical Research Center’s dining facility; weekday lunches and snacks and all weekend meals
were packaged for take-out.
‡‡‡ Subjects were taking chronic statin therapy, defined as a consistent statin dose for at least 8 weeks before study entry with continuation of the same dose during the 4-week study period. Subjects who took lipid-lowering agents other than
statins were excluded. Post-menopausal F who were not taking HRT or were on a consistent HRT dose were included. F of child-bearing potential using an effective form of contraception were allowed to participate in the study.
§§§ Subjects received NCEP ATP III diet counselling via telephone and instructions on how to compensate for the added energy from the almonds.
║║║ The authors argued that a WO was not included because serum lipids and lipoproteins are known to stabilise within 3 weeks.
¶¶¶ Although the mean BMI was NR, it should be noted that a BMI >30 kg/m2 was an exclusion criterion.
**** On Sunday to Friday of each week, subjects ate breakfast and dinner at the Loma Linda University metabolic kitchen. Lunch meals and all Saturday meals were packaged for consumption away from the metabolic kitchen.
†††† The mean age was provided for the forty-five study completers. Because the mean age was not provided for each group, the weighted mean age for each comparison could not be calculated.
‡‡‡‡ All subjects were provided with whole-grain bread, brown rice, pasta, non-fat yogurt, rice cakes, dry beans, lentils, and couscous and were instructed to eat these foods a set number of times during each week. Subjects rounded out their daily
food intake with fruits, vegetables, other whole grains, legumes, low-fat or non-fat milk (whole milk dairy products were not allowed), egg whites and lean fish. Lean beef was allowed twice weekly, and poultry and fatty fish were permitted up to four
times weekly. Up to four whole eggs were permitted/week, but only if the subject had been consuming eggs prior to the study. Foods not allowed included: commercial or homemade products containing fats other than the study fat, and products
made with refined flour (e.g. snack foods, chips, crackers, cakes, pastries, pies, candy or ice cream). Usual coffee, tea, alcohol and soft drink consumption was permitted.
§§§§ Subjects on insulin therapy were excluded. Subjects taking prescription medications, including oral hypoglycaemic agents, statins or hypertensive medications were instructed to maintain consistent use throughout the study.
║║║║ The study by Tamizifar et al.(21) was described as SB. Given that, during the almond phase of the crossover study, the subjects were given almond powder and, during the control phase, the subjects were not administered anything, it is
assumed that the investigators were blinded, and not the subjects.
¶¶¶¶ Subjects were considered at risk of T2DM if they were overweight or obese (BMI >27 kg/m2) or were normal weight (BMI 18·5–24·9 kg/m2) but had a strong family history for T2DM.
***** The proportion of subjects with a diagnosis of hypertension at baseline was 62 % in the control group and 50 % in the almond group; the proportion of subjects with T2DM was NR. However, it was noted that during randomisation, subjects
were stratified according to the presence or absence of T2DM.
††††† Prediabetes was diagnosed according to the 2005 ADA diagnostic guidelines: fasting blood glucose between 100 and 125 mg/dl (5·56 and 6·94 mmol/l) or casual blood glucose ≥140–199 mg/dl (≥7·78–11·06 mmol/l).
‡‡‡‡‡ Subjects taking corticosteroids or immunosuppressant medications were excluded. Two subjects in each group were taking lipid-lowering medications.

 whether TAG levels at baseline were or were not optimal
could not be made. In the study by Spiller et al. strata 1 and
2(17), TC, LDL-C, HDL-C and TAG were assessed at baseline
and at the end of treatment; however, only the results for TC
and LDL-C at the end of treatment were reported. Thus, the
HDL-C and TAG results could not be included in the
meta-analyses, and in order to include the results related to
TC and LDL-C in the meta-analyses, the mean difference in
the effect for TC and LDL-C had to be calculated by subtract-
ing the end-of-treatment value in the control group from the
end-of-treatment value in the almond group (as opposed to
subtracting the changes from baseline in the control group
from the changes from baseline in the almond group, which
was done for all other parallel studies).
The effects of almonds on fasting TC levels were assessed in
all twenty-seven strata. The daily almond intake was 45 g or
greater in 63 % of the strata, the design was crossover in
37 % of the strata, the baseline fasting TC level was not opti-
mal in 52 % of the strata, a control food/diet was provided in
52 % of the strata, and the study duration was <12 weeks in
78 % of the strata (Table 3). As can be seen in Table 3 and
Fig. 2, the reduction in TC was statistically significant when
data from all twenty-seven strata were pooled (−0·153
mmol/l; 95 % CI −0·235, −0·070 mmol/l; P < 0·001). As
there was no publication bias identified, no adjustment to
these values was made. In all of the subgroup analyses, the
pooled effect sizes for TC were negative. Statistical significance
was observed when pooling those strata in which the almond
dose was ≥45 g/d, the baseline TC level was not optimal, the
study design was either parallel or crossover, the control food/
diet either was or was not provided, and the duration of the
almond intervention period was <12 weeks (Table 3).
The effects of almonds on fasting LDL-C were assessed in
twenty-five strata. The daily almond intake was 45 g or greater
in 60 % of the strata, the design was crossover in 40 % of the
strata, the baseline fasting LDL-C level was not optimal in 80
% of the strata, a control food/diet was provided in 48 % of
the strata, and the study duration was <12 weeks in 76 %
of the strata (Table 3). As can be seen in Table 3 and
Fig. 3, the reduction in LDL-C was statistically significant
when data from all twenty-five strata were pooled (−0·124
mmol/l; 95 % CI −0·196, −0·051 mmol/l; P = 0·001). As
there was no publication bias identified, no adjustment to
these values was made. In all of the subgroup analyses, the
pooled effect sizes for LDL-C were negative, except for
when the five strata in which the baseline blood lipid level
was optimal were pooled. For the subgroup analyses, statistic-
ally significant pooled reductions in LDL-C were observed
when pooling those strata in which the almond dose was
≥45 g/d, the baseline LDL-C level was not optimal, the
study design was crossover, a control food/diet was provided,
and the study duration was <12 weeks (Table 3). It should be
noted that when the control-adjusted changes in LDL-C for
the thirteen strata in which the control food/diet was not pro-
vided were pooled, the reduction in LDL-C approached stat-
istical significance (P = 0·068).
Almond consumption was not associated with any signifi-
cant effect on fasting HDL-C, either in the overall analysis
in which all twenty-two strata were pooled or in any of the
subgroup analyses (Table 3 and Fig. 4).
The effects of almonds on fasting TAG were assessed in
twenty-five strata. The almond intake was 45 g or greater in
60 % of the strata, the design was crossover in 40 % of the
strata, the baseline fasting TAG level was not optimal
in 30 % of the strata, a control food/diet was provided in
48 % of the strata, and the study duration was <12 weeks in
76 % of the strata (Table 3). As can be seen in Table 3 and
Fig. 5, the reduction in TAG was statistically significant
when data from all twenty-five strata were pooled (−0·067
mmol/l; 95 % CI −0·132, −0·002 mmol/l; P = 0·042). As
there was no publication bias identified, no adjustment to
these values was made. In all of the subgroup analyses, the
pooled effect sizes for TAG were negative but not statistically
significant, except for when the fifteen strata in which the
study design was parallel were pooled, and the resultant
pooled effect was a statistically significant reduction in TAG
(−0·111 mmol/l; 95 % CI −0·204, −0·017; P = 0·020).
Through additional sensitivity analyses, it was determined
that this effect was dependent on the inclusion of the parallel
study by Abazarfard et al.(9), which included 100 females and
was a relatively larger study.
With regards to the ratio of TC:HDL-C, when data from all
nine strata were pooled, the reduction in the ratio was statistic-
ally significant (see Table 3 and Fig. 6). However, publication
bias was detected. Using trim and fill, two studies were found
to be missing to the right of the pooled effect size, and with
these studies imputed, the pooled effect, though negative
(i.e. favourable), was smaller and no longer statistically significant
(Table 3). Results for the subgroup analyses were in the same
direction of effect (i.e. the pooled effect was negative), with vari-
able statistical significance. With regards to the ratio of LDL-C:
HDL-C, when data from all ten strata were pooled, the reduction
in the ratio was not significant (−0·089; 95 % CI −0·209, 0·031;
P = 0·145) (see Table 3 and Fig. 7). As for the ratio of TC:
HDL-C, publication bias was detected, and using trim and fill,
two studies were found to be missing to the right of the pooled
effect size for LDL-C:HDL-C. With these studies imputed, the
pooled effect, though negative (i.e. favourable), was smaller and
remained non-statistically significant (Table 3). Results for the
subgroup analyses were in the same direction of effect (i.e. the
pooled effect was negative), with variable statistical significance.
Discussion
In a meta-analysis that included five randomised control trials
(and nine strata), Phung et al.(7) reported that almonds signifi-
cantly reduce TC and have a strong trend towards reducing
LDL-C (P = 0·05). Although Phung et al.(7) also reported a
near-significant reduction in HDL-C (P = 0·08) and no effect
on TAG, in our analyses, which are based on a total of eight-
een publications and twenty-seven strata, the intake of
almonds was associated with significant reductions in TC,
LDL-C and TAG, and no effects on HDL-C.
In a meta-analysis and dose–response of sixty-one con-
trolled intervention trials, which ranged in duration from 3
to 26 weeks, the consumption of nuts was associated with

 significant reductions in TC, LDL-C, apoB and TAG, with
greater effects observed with a nut intake of 60 g/d and in
individuals with T2DM(29). In contrast, in a Cochrane review,
Martin et al.(30) reported that the intake of nuts had no effects
on LDL-C or HDL-C (for TC and TAG, substantial hetero-
geneity precluded the pooling of results). The Cochrane
assessment was based only on three publications (and four
strata): Tey et al.(31) (who provided 42 g of hazelnuts to
generally healthy male and female adults for 12 weeks);
Abazfarad et al.(9) (who provided 50 g of almonds to over-
weight and obese premenopausal women for 3 months); and
Tey et al.(32) (who provided 30 or 60 g of hazelnuts to over-
weight and obese male and female adults for 12 weeks). The
main objective of the Cochrane review was to assess the
effects of nut consumption on the primary prevention of
CVD. In none of the studies was the incidence of heart disease
assessed; thus, the effects of nut consumption on surrogate
measures of CVD risk were examined. With such few studies,

 and with three of the four strata conducted in generally healthy
subjects, it is no surprise that effects on blood lipid levels
could not be identified.
Based
on
our
systematic evidence-based
review and
meta-analyses, which included a total of eighteen publications
and twenty-seven strata, the intake of almonds was associated
with significant reductions in TC, LDL-C and TAG, and no
effects on HDL-C. In all of the included studies, almonds
or diets enriched with almonds were provided to the subjects;
however, the control was variable across the studies. In
thirteen of the twenty-seven strata, a control food or diet
was not administered to the subjects and the subjects
were instructed not to consume nuts. In fourteen of the
twenty-seven strata, the subjects were provided with a control
food or a control diet. It seems that almonds effectively im-
prove TC and LDL-C, whether the comparison is made
with the consumption of no almonds or with a control food
or diet that, at the very least, was isoenergetic to the almond
intervention. Based on the other subgroup analyses, it seems
that the efficacy of almonds in improving TC and LDL-C is
greatest with a daily almond intake of 45 g or more and in indi-
viduals whose TC and LDL-C levels at baseline are elevated
(i.e. not optimal). Although pooling the results of the crossover
studies (but not the parallel studies) resulted in a significant re-
duction in LDL-C, the results should be interpreted with
caution, given that the crossover strata were comprised

 predominantly of subjects whose baseline LDL-C levels were
not optimal, while the parallel strata were comprised predom-
inantly of subjects whose baseline LDL-C levels were optimal.
Likewise, although pooling the results of the studies with a
duration <12 weeks (but not the studies with a duration
≥12 weeks) resulted in significant reductions in both TC
and LDL-C, the results should be interpreted with caution,
given that there were only six strata with a duration ≥12
weeks, and in three of these six strata, the intake of almonds
was <45 g/d and/or the subjects had optimal levels of TC
and/or LDL-C at baseline(10,16,24). Of the three parallel strata
that were 12 weeks or longer in duration and in which the al-
mond intake was ≥45 g/d and the baseline lipid levels were
not optimal, there were significant or near-significant reduc-
tions in both TC and LDL-C in two of the strata(9,23).
There is preliminary evidence that the consumption of
almonds also leads to favourable changes in the ratio of TC:
HDL-C; however, this lipid parameter was assessed only in
nine strata, and the improvement was no longer statistically
significant once an adjustment for publication bias was
made. Preliminary evidence that the consumption of almonds
leads to favourable changes in the ratio of TC:HDL-C is con-
sistent with our findings of significant reductions in TC, with
no effects on HDL-C. LDL-C as well as the ratio of TC:
HDL-C are recognised as surrogate measures of CHD risk.
Thus, it is plausible that by improving the blood lipid profile,
the consumption of almonds would also be associated with
significant reductions in the risk of CHD. While an interven-
tion study on the effects of almonds on the risk of CHD
has yet to be conducted, there is evidence from both prospect-
ive observational studies and a randomised controlled trial that
the consumption of nuts, in general, is associated with signifi-
cant reductions in the incidence of heart disease (discussed in
the following paragraph).
In a meta-analysis of thirteen prospective studies (involving
a total of 347 477 individuals and 6127 cases of coronary ar-
tery disease (CAD)), the relative risk (RR) of CAD was signifi-
cantly reduced with the highest v. the lowest consumption of
nuts (RR 0·660; 95 % CI 0·581, 0·748); moreover, the protect-
ive effect of nuts against the development of CAD was found
to be dose-dependent, such that risk decreased by 5 % for
every additional serving of nuts consumed per week(33). In
the PREDIMED (PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea)
study, which is a large, multi-centre primary prevention trial
of the effects of three diets on CVD risk, the consumption
of a Mediterranean diet supplemented with either extra-virgin
olive oil or nuts resulted in significant reductions in CVD cases
(including cases of myocardial infarction, stroke, or CVD
death) relative to a control group instructed to consume a
diet low in fat(34). In a recent cross-sectional study involving
3 312 403 Americans undergoing screening for peripheral arter-
ial disease, those who consumed nuts every day were 21 % less
likely to have peripheral arterial disease relative to those who
consumed nuts less than once per month; this statistically

 significant finding was evident even after adjusting for several
important variables, such as age, sex, smoking status, obesity,
family history of CVD, diet and the presence of diet-related dis-
eases such as diabetes(35).
The mechanism by which the consumption of nuts leads to
favourable alternations in blood lipid levels is not fully under-
stood. Nuts are nutrient dense, have a favourable fatty acid
profile, and contain other constituents such as sterols and fla-
vonoids that, collectively, may be important in the mechanism
of almonds in improving blood lipid levels and CHD risk. In
addition, it is possible that the favourable changes in blood
lipid levels with the consumption of almonds are related, at
least in part, to concomitant improvements in body weight
and body composition. In several of the studies that were
included in our meta-analysis, there were significant reductions
in body weight with the consumption of almonds relative to
the control(11,20,28). The study by Berryman et al.(11) is of par-
ticular interest, given that the subjects were provided with all
of their foods during both the almond and control interven-
tion periods, and the diets were rigorously controlled. There
were statistically significant improvements in body weight,
waist circumference and body composition (including abdom-
inal fat mass) with the 6-week consumption of the almond diet
relative to the control diet. Recently, it was demonstrated that
the energy value of almonds calculated using the Atwater fac-
tors is 32 % greater than the actual energy that is metabolisable
from almonds(36). Similar observations have also been made
for pistachios and walnuts(37,38). This could explain the reduc-
tions in body weight that have been observed in some of the
studies with the consumption of almonds. If not all of the ‘cal-
culated’ energy in almonds is actually metabolisable, then in
highly controlled experimental studies where the diets are pre-
pared and provided to the study participants (such as in the
study by Berryman et al.(11)), the diets may not have been
truly isoenergetic.
The
consumption
of
nuts
is
encouraged
in
several
‘heart-healthy’ diets. Nuts are important constituents of the
portfolio diet, which also consists of plant sterols, viscous
fibres and soya protein(39). Likewise, nuts are part of the
Mediterranean diet, which consists also of fruits and vegeta-
bles, legumes, whole-grain cereals, olive oil, fish and seafood,
herbs and spices, and moderate amounts of meat, dairy pro-
ducts and wine(40). Nuts are constituents of the Palaeolithic
diet, which also includes lean meat, fish, fruit, leafy and crucif-
erous vegetables, root vegetables and eggs(41). The consump-
tion of nuts, such as almonds, as part of a healthy diet
should be encouraged in order to help in the maintenance
of normal blood lipid levels and to reduce the risk of heart
disease.
