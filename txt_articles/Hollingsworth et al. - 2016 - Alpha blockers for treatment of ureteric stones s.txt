review methODs
Randomized controlled trials of alpha blockers 
compared with placebo or control for treatment of 
ureteric stones were eligible. Two team members 
independently extracted data from each included 
study. The primary outcome was the proportion of 
patients who passed their stone. Secondary outcomes 
were the time to passage; the number of pain 
episodes; and the proportions of patients who 
underwent surgery, required admission to hospital, 
and experienced an adverse event. Pooled risk ratios 
and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for the 
primary outcome with profile likelihood random effects 
models. Cochrane Collaboration’s tool for assessing 
risk of bias and the GRADE approach were used to 
evaluate the quality of evidence and summarize 
conclusions.
results
55 randomized controlled trials were included. There 
was moderate quality evidence that alpha blockers 
facilitate passage of ureteric stones (risk ratio 1.49, 
95% confidence interval 1.39 to 1.61). Based on a priori 
subgroup analysis, there seemed to be no benefit to 
treatment with alpha blocker among patients with 
smaller ureteric stones (1.19, 1.00 to 1.48). Patients 
with larger stones treated with an alpha blocker, 
however, had a 57% higher risk of stone passage 
compared with controls (1.57, 1.17 to 2.27). The effect of 
alpha blockers was independent of stone location 
(1.48 (1.05 to 2.10) for upper or middle stones; 1.49 
(1.38 to 1.63) for lower stones). Compared with 
controls, patients who received alpha blockers had 
significantly shorter times to stone passage (mean 
difference −3.79 days, −4.45 to −3.14; moderate 
quality evidence), fewer episodes of pain (−0.74 
episodes, −1.28 to −0.21; low quality evidence), lower 
risks of surgical intervention (risk ratio 0.44, 0.37 to 
0.52; moderate quality evidence), and lower risks of 
admission to hospital (0.37, 0.22 to 0.64; moderate 
quality evidence). The risk of a serious adverse event 
was similar between treatment and control groups 
(1.49, 0.24 to 9.35; low quality evidence).
COnClusiOns
Alpha blockers seem efficacious in the treatment of 
patients with ureteric stones who are amenable to 
conservative management. The greatest benefit might 
be among those with larger stones. These results 
support current guideline recommendations 
advocating a role for alpha blockers in patients with 
ureteric stones.

Introduction
Contemporary practice guidelines from leading profes-
sional societies recognize the off-label use of alpha 
adrenergic antagonists (or alpha blockers) as an initial 
treatment option for patients with newly diagnosed, 
uncomplicated ureteric stones <10 mm in size, whose 
symptoms are controlled.1 
2  This endorsement is based 
on several systematic reviews and meta-analyses of 
numerous randomized controlled trials, which, in 
aggregate, showed a higher risk of stone passage 
among patients treated with alpha blockers (their use 
has been termed medical expulsive therapy) compared 
with controls.3-9 Consequently, such treatment has 
become part of the routine management algorithm for 
ureteric colic.
Even ardent proponents of medical expulsive ther-
apy concede that many supporting data come from 
small, single centre, low quality studies, and a large 
confirmatory trial has been recommended. This 
prompted a recent multicentre randomized controlled 
trial in the United Kingdom that involved over 1100 
patients with ureteric stones.10 The trail showed this 
treatment to be no more efficacious than placebo at 
decreasing four week rates of intervention for stone 
clearance. In light of these results, the investigators 
concluded that medical expulsive therapy “should not

be offered to patients with ureteric colic managed 
expectantly, giving providers of health care an opportu-
nity to reallocate resources elsewhere.”
Despite the rigor of this trial, concerns have been 
raised about the choice of primary endpoint and the 
possibility that other important data might have been 
overlooked (for example, the high background rate of 
spontaneous stone passage).11-14  Further, while inter-
vention rates were similar between the treatment and 
placebo groups for smaller and upper/middle ureteric 
stones, results were consistent with a clinically import-
ant effect only in patients with larger, lower  
calculi.10 To 
help reconcile these issues, we conducted a systematic 
review, identifying all randomized controlled trials 
examining alpha blockers for treatment of ureteric 
stones. We then pooled data to derive estimates of the 
effect of alpha blockers on stone passage, including a 
priori subgroup analyses to assess the impact that stone 
size and location have on efficacy.
Methods
Data sources and searches
Following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for 
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) statement,15 we 
prospectively registered our review on PROSPERO 
(CRD42015024169). We established inclusion criteria 
before beginning our search. We considered all ran-
domized controlled trials in any language that looked at 
alpha blockers compared with placebo or control for 
treatment of ureteric stones. Controls were defined a 
priori as patients who had not received any additional 
treatment to facilitate stone passage (such as antispas-
molytics, antimuscarinics) with the exception of corti-
costeroids and only if they were applied equally to both 
treatment arms. We included only those trials in which 
alpha blockers were used as the main treatment. Thus, 
we excluded trials in which alpha blockers were exam-
ined as an adjuvant to surgery (for example, after 
shockwave lithotripsy or ureteroscopy).
A Cochrane Collaboration systematic review identi-
fied all randomized controlled trials on alpha blockers 
for ureteric stones published up to 9 July 2012.6 This 
review served as the foundation for our search. One 
member of our study team, a trained medical librarian, 
performed an updated electronic search of the Cochrane 
Central Register of Controlled Trials (via Wiley), Web of 
Science, Embase, LILACS, and Medline (via PubMed) 
databases up to 10 July 2016. We used boolean logic to 
incorporate various terms and synonyms for concepts 
in each of three distinct filters: an anatomic filter for 
ureteric stones, a treatment filter for alpha blockers, 
and a publication type filter for randomized controlled 
trials. When possible, we used controlled vocabulary 
(such as MeSH in PubMed, EMTREE in Embase) and key 
words. Although we tailored the precise strategy to 
accommodate each database’s features, as an example 
appendix 1 shows the strategy we used in PubMed. 
Other search strategies are available on request.
In addition, we scanned the reference lists of other pub-
lished narrative and systematic reviews to identify poten-
tial additional studies not retrieved by our  
electronic 
search. In an effort to find unpublished studies, we also 
hand searched abstracts from the annual meetings of the 
World Congress of Endourology and SWL, the European 
Association of Urology, and the American Urological Asso-
ciation to 10 July 2016. To identify ongoing trials, we used 
the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform 
(ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov search portals.
study selection
We used the reference manager software Endnote to 
identify and remove duplicate records. Next, we imported 
references into Covidence (www.covidence.org), and two 
study team members independently scanned each title 
and abstract. For studies that advanced beyond this 
stage, two study team members then performed indepen-
dent full text reviews. We mapped publications relating 
to the same trial to unique studies. When we found mul-
tiple publications from a research group, we contacted 
the corresponding author to determine whether their 
reports were from the same study population, and we 
removed duplicates. We had non-English language arti-
cles translated before review. Once we identified all 
potentially relevant articles, two study team members 
met to achieve consensus. When necessary, we used 
third party adjudication to settle disputes.
Data extraction and risk of bias assessment
For each study selected for inclusion, two team members 
independently extracted data using a pilot tested stan-
dardized form. We resolved inconsistencies between the 
two through discussion, with a third team member serv-
ing as the arbitrator. We collected information on study 
characteristics (study year, country of origin, publication 
type, use of placebo, maximum length of follow-up, and 
imaging use), patients’ characteristics (age, sex, and 
stone size and location), and data on outcomes. Our pri-
mary outcome was the proportion of patients who passed 
their stone. Our secondary outcomes were the time to 
passage, the number of episodes of pain, and the propor-
tions of patients who underwent surgical intervention, 
required admission to hospital, and experienced a seri-
ous adverse event (as defined by the study authors). We 
also examined specific adverse events including dizzi-
ness, headache, fatigue, malaise, insomnia, hypoten-
sion, palpitations, collapse, retrograde/abnormal 
ejaculation, sexual dysfunction, dyspepsia, diarrhea, 
nausea, vomiting, constipation, flatulence, abdominal 
pain, nasal congestion, cough, arthralgia, and rash.
To assess the risk of bias of the selected studies, we 
used the Cochrane Collaboration’s tool on an outcome 
specific basis.16 Relying only on the information pre-
sented in the study report and making no assumptions, 
two team members evaluated each trial across four 
domains. These domains included sequence genera-
tion/allocation concealment (selection bias), blinding of 
participants and personnel (performance bias), blinding 
of outcome assessors (detection bias), and complete-
ness of follow-up (attrition bias). For each domain, indi-
vidual team members judged whether the risk of bias in 
a given study was “low,” “high,” or “unclear.” Any dis-
agreements were referred to a third team member.

Data synthesis and primary analysis
We conducted two tailed statistical tests and set the 
probability of type I error at 0.05. We performed all cal-
culations using Stata/MP, version 14.1 (StataCorp, Col-
lege Station, TX). In preliminary analyses, we pooled the 
proportion of patients who passed stones in each study 
group (treatment, control) using the random effects pro-
file likelihood method and the Freeman-Tukey double 
arcsine transformation to stabilize the variance.17  Our 
main estimates of effect were pooled risk ratios with 
95% confidence intervals. Specifically, we compared the 
proportion of people taking an alpha blocker who 
passed their stones (numerator) with the proportion not 
taking an alpha blocker (controls) who passed their 
stones (denominator). For these comparisons, we fitted 
random effects models and calculated 95% confidence 
intervals using two different estimators—the profile like-
lihood and restricted maximum likelihood methods.18
When the number of pooled studies was small (fewer 
than 10), we used the more conservative Har-
tung-Knapp-Sidik-Jonkman method to calculate confi-
dence intervals,19-21 which is based on a t distribution. 
For studies that involved different alpha blockers (for 
example, tamsulosin and terazosin) or different doses 
of the same drug (for example, tamsulosin 0.2 mg and 
0.4 mg), we collapsed the separate treatment arms into 
one for our main analysis. We computed pooled risk dif-
ferences to generate number needed to treat (calculated 
as the inverse of the pooled risk difference) with 95% 
confidence intervals from the profile likelihood method. 
To determine whether an early extreme result for treat-
ment with an alpha blocker deviated from the results of 
later studies (the Proteus phenomenon), we used the 
approach described by Ioannidis and Trikalinos.22  The 
prediction interval was calculated for the primary out-
come (stone passage); this interval reflects the expected 
future benefits of treatment to patients.23
Based on a priori decisions, we also performed sub-
group analyses, stratifying by stone size and location. 
In some trials, the investigators reported outcomes in 
patients who had smaller versus larger ureteric stones; 
we used these size thresholds, ranging from 5 mm to 8 
mm, to stratify the results. For our analyses of stone 
location, we collapsed upper and middle ureteric stones 
into one category.
To assess statistical heterogeneity, we calculated τ2, 
which represents variance between studies (τ is the esti-
mated standard deviation of the effects across stud-
ies).24 We also calculated the I2 statistic, which esti-
mates the proportion of variability in the meta-analysis 
caused by differences between studies rather than sam-
pling error.25 Prior empirical work suggests that τ2 per-
forms better than I2 as precision increases.26
sensitivity analyses
To better understand the sources of statistical heterogene-
ity between studies, as well as test the robustness of our 
findings, we then performed a series of sensitivity analyses.
First, we repeated our analysis, excluding those stud-
ies in which corticosteroids were co-administered. Sec-
ond, we restricted our analysis to only those studies 
published as full length, peer reviewed research arti-
cles. Third, we pooled data only from those studies that 
had placebo controls. Fourth, to evaluate the impact 
that baseline risk had on our estimates, we conducted 
meta-regression using the restricted maximum 
 
likelihood method for variance between studies with 
the Knapp-Hartung modification to calculate P values 
and confidence intervals. We also used meta-regression 
to assess differences in effect related to length of fol-
low-up and sex composition. Fifth, we performed sensi-
tivity analyses based on variation between studies in 
the risk of bias. For each of the four domains described 
above, a study was awarded a point if the risk of bias 
was judged low. As such, a study could be awarded a 
maximum of four points. We categorized each study by 
its point totals as being of low (three or four points), 
moderate (two points), or high risk of bias (zero or one 
point). Finally, to examine the effect of individual stud-
ies on our summary estimates, we conducted an influ-
ence analysis, in which we recalculated pooled 
estimates omitting one study at a time.
secondary analyses
In addition to our primary analysis, we derived sum-
mary estimates of effect for our secondary outcomes. 
When we used continuous scales of measurement (time 
to stone passage, number of pain episodes), we summa-
rized our findings with the pooled mean difference. For 
dichotomous outcomes (need for surgical intervention, 
subsequent admission to hospital, occurrence of an 
adverse event), we again used pooled risk ratios.
assessing for publication bias
We explored the possibility of publication bias visually, 
checking for asymmetry in contoured funnel plots of 
treatment effect against its standard error, and with for-
mal statistical procedures. Specifically, we used Har-
bord’s test for dichotomous endpoints and Egger’s test 
for continuous endpoints to examine possible small 
study effects.27
Patient involvement
No patients were involved in setting the research ques-
tion or the outcome measures, nor were they involved in 
developing plans for design or implementation of our 
study. We did not ask patients for advice on interpreta-
tion or writing up of our results. We have no plans to 
disseminate our results to patient participants from the 
pooled studies.
rating quality of evidence for each pooled analysis
Finally, we rated our confidence in the estimates of 
effect for each outcome according to the GRADE 
approach, taking into account study limitations (risk of 
bias), inconsistency, imprecision, indirectness and 
publication bias.28 For each comparison, two team 
members independently rated the quality of evidence 
for each outcome as “high,” “moderate,” “low,” or 
“very low” using GRADEpro GDT (http://gradepro.org). 
We resolved discrepancies by consensus, and if needed, 
with arbitration by a third team member.

Results
search strategy results
From our electronic search, we identified 286 studies. 
We found an additional 20 records by hand searching 
meeting abstracts and from reference lists of other 
review articles. When we combined these with the 29 
references from the 2014 Cochrane review,6  there were 
443 potentially relevant studies in total. Of these, we 
excluded 355 during the initial screening phase based 
on the title and abstract. For the remaining 88 studies, 
we performed a full text screening and eliminated 33 
studies because they included duplicate populations, 
had an observational design, or their treatment groups 
received additional treatment to facilitate stone pas-
sage. This yielded 55 unique studies (involving 5990 
randomized patients) that examined the effect of alpha 
blockers on ureteric stones (fig 1 ) and met our inclusion 
criteria.10

The baseline rate of stone passage without treatment

effect of alpha blockers on passage of ureteric 
stones
The random effects pooled risk ratio (and 95% confi-
dence interval estimated with the profile likelihood 
method) was 1.49 (1.39 to 1.61), indicating a 49% higher 
risk of stone passage associated with treatment with an 
alpha blocker (fig 3 ). The 95% confidence interval 
obtained with the restricted maximum likelihood 
method was similar (1.39 to 1.59). The quality of evi-
dence for stone passage was rated “moderate” accord-
ing the GRADE approach (table 1). The pooled risk 
difference was 0.27 (0.22 to 0.31). In other words, four 
patients would need treatment for one patient to realize 
benefit from alpha blockers. The prediction interval for 
the pooled risk ratio was 1.12 to 1.86. The pooled per-
centages for stone passage in the intervention and con-
trol groups were 75.8% (72.1% to 79.2%) and 48.4% 
(43.5% to 53.1%), respectively. When the follow-up time 
was held constant at 28 days, these pooled percentages 
were 75.8% (71.4% to 80.0%) and 48.2% (42.0% to 
54.4%), respectively.
In a cumulative meta-analysis, where we added stud-
ies one at a time (based on the publication date) and 
summarized the pooled risk ratio of ureteric stone pas-
sage as each new study was added, we observed a fairly 
stable pattern since 2006 (fig B in appendix 3). We saw 
no significant Proteus effect (P=0.32).
To determine if the effect size varied by the type of 
alpha blocker used, we performed meta-regression. 
There were no significant differences between the risk 
ratios for tamsulosin compared with alfuzosin (P=0.96), 
doxazosin (P=0.91), naftopidil (P=0.31), silodosin 
(P=0.37), or terazosin (P=0.88).

the pooled risk ratio was 1.54 (1.41 to 1.70).
Regarding stone size, we observed no benefit to treat-
ment with an alpha blocker among patients with 
smaller ureteric stones (fig 4 ; pooled risk ratio 1.19, 95% 
confidence interval 1.00 to 1.48). Patients with larger 
stones who received an alpha blocker, however, had a 
57% higher risk of stone passage compared with 
 
controls (1.57
, 1.17 to 2.27). Results from meta-regression 
indicated that there was a 9.8% increase in the risk ratio 
for stone passage for every 1 mm increase in stone size 
(2.5% to 17
.7%; P<0.01). With respect to stone location 
(fig 5), the pooled risk ratio was 1.48 (1.05 to 2.10) for 
upper or middle ureteric stones and 1.49 (1.38 to 1.63) for 
lower ureteric stones.
sensitivity analyses
There was statistical heterogeneity in the risk ratio for 
passage of ureteric stones across studies (τ2=0.03, 95% 
confidence interval 0.0 to 0.06; I2=60, 46.6% to 70.4%). 
When we considered only those studies involving pla-
cebo controls, the pooled risk ratio was attenuated 
(1.32, 1.14 to 1.59), but significant heterogeneity 
remained (τ2=0.05; I2=82%). Exclusion of studies in 
which corticosteroids were co-administered had little 
impact on our summary findings (1.47
, 1.37 to 1.59) and 
explained little of the heterogeneity (τ2=0.03; I2=59%). 
In analyses restricted to full length, peer reviewed 
research articles,10 29 30 32 34 35 36 38-41 43-56 58 61-67 69 70 72 74 75-82 
the pooled risk ratio 1.47 (1.36 to 1.61) and heterogeneity 
(τ2=0.04; I2=64%) were stable.
In meta-regression, there was no significant asso-
ciation between maximum follow-up and stone pas-
sage (P=0.71). There also was no association 
between sex and stone passage (P=0.85). Baseline 
risk (stone passage in patients not treated with an 
alpha blocker), however, did explain some of varia-
tion in effect across the studies (fig 3). The pooled 
risk ratio was 2.11 (95% confidence interval 1.72 to 
2.65; τ2=0.07; I2=44%) for trials with a baseline risk 
of <40%,29 43 47 49 50 55 57-60 62 65 67 72 75-77 1.52 (1.40 to 1.63; 
τ2<0.001; I2=0%) for trials with a baseline risk of 
40-60%,30 31 33-35 38-41 45 46 51 52 54 61 63 64 69 71 73 74 78 79 82 and 
1.20 (1.10 to 1.32; τ2=0.01; I2=56%) for trials with a 
baseline risk of >60%.10 32 36 37 42 44 48 53 56 66 68 70 80 81
When we regressed baseline risk on the log of the risk 
ratio for passage of ureteric stones, there was a signifi-
cant inverse linear association (fig C in appendix 3). For 
every 10% increase in the baseline risk, the relative risk 
of passage decreased by 13% (P<0.01). Among studies 
in which the baseline risk was high, those by Pickard 
and colleagues,10  Furyk and colleagues,81  and Desai 
and colleagues68 were noted to be most influential on 
our pooled estimate of stone passage (fig D in appendix 
3). With omission of the study by Pickard and col-
leagues, the pooled risk ratio was 1.23 (1.13 to 1.35; 
τ2=0.01; I2=38%). With removal of the Furyk and Desai 
studies, the pooled risk ratios were 1.22 (1.12 to 1.35; 
τ2=0.01; I2=50%) and 1.17 (1.08 to 1.30; τ2=0.01; I2=50%), 
respectively.
In a further sensitivity analysis, we recalculated our 
summary estimates including only moderate and low 
risk of bias. The beneficial effect of treatment with 
alpha blockers on passage of ureteric stones persisted, 
but its magnitude was diminished (13 studies, 2469 
patients: pooled risk ratio 1.33, 95% confidence interval 
1.15 to 1.59; τ2=0.04; I2=79%).10

effect of alpha blockers on secondary outcomes
As displayed in figure E in appendix 3, compared with 
controls, patients who received alpha blockers had a sig-
nificantly lower risk of surgical intervention (32 studies, 
3758 patients: pooled risk ratio 0.44, 95% confidence 
interval 0.37 to 0.52; τ2=0.07; I2=39%; moderate quality 
evidence).10 30 32-36 39 41 43-46 48 52 55 56 60 63-65 67-70 74 76-78 80-82

pooled risk ratio for surgery with alpha blockers was 
0.46 (0.38 to 0.53; τ2=0.07; I2=38%). In meta-regression, 
the results for surgical intervention were similar to those 
for stone passage—that is, there was no significant asso-
ciation between maximum follow-up days and surgery 
(P=0.70) and no association between sex and surgery 
(P=0.42). The results remained significant regardless of 
the baseline risk (fig E, appendix 3). From the Har-
tung-Knapp-Sidik-Jonkman method, the pooled risk 
ratio for surgery in the category of low baseline risk was 
0.46 (0.37 to 0.57; τ2<0.001; I2=0%).43

82 Figure F in appendix 3

patients: pooled mean difference −3.79 days, 95% confi-
dence interval −4.45 to −3.14; τ2=1.42, I2=74%; moderate 
quality evidence). Mean time to stone passage 
(unweighted) was 8.8 and 13.3 days in the treatment and 
control groups, respectively. Figure F in appendix 3 
shows that there was also a significant difference in the 
mean number of episodes of pain, favoring treatment 
with an alpha blocker (13 studies, 1235 patients: −0.74 
episodes, −1.28 to −0.21; τ2=0.78; I2=94%; low quality 
evidence).32

Adverse events were uncommon among treatment 
and control groups (fig I, appendix 3). Men receiving 
alpha blockers were more likely than male controls to 
experience abnormal ejaculation (pooled risk ratio 
4.09, 95% confidence interval 1.73 to 12.04). The risk of a 
serious adverse event, however, was similar between 
the two groups (1.49, 0.24 to 9.35; low quality evidence).
risk of publication bias
Inspection of the funnel plots showed asymmetry (fig J, 
appendix 3), indicating evidence of a small study effect 
for stone passage (Harbord’s test: P<0.01), surgical 
intervention (Harbord’s test: P<0.01), and pain (Egger’s 
test: P=0.01), but not for time to stone passage (Egger’s 
test: P=0.40) or admission to hospital (Harbord’s test: 
P=0.48). Thus, we calculated the pooled risk ratio only 
for large studies (sample size ≥100).10 34 38 47 51 57 63-65 68-

82 This yielded a pooled risk ratio of 1.39 (95% 
confidence interval 1.26 to 1.58) for stone passage and 
0.46 (0.33 to 0.60) for surgery.
discussion
statement of principal findings
The pooled results of the randomized controlled trials 
suggest that alpha blockers help facilitate the passage 
of larger ureteric stones regardless of their location. 
Given the low risk profile of these drugs and their wide 
therapeutic window, our findings suggest that clini-
cians who manage patients with ureteric colic should 
consider prescribing a course of an alpha blocker, 
unless it is medically contraindicated.
Our findings on the effectiveness of medical expul-
sive therapy as it relates to the size of ureteric stones 
have face validity. Data from several observational stud-
ies suggest that nearly all smaller ureteric stones (that 
is, <5 mm) will pass without difficulty.83 
84  The expected 
benefit of medical expulsive therapy (for augmenting 
stone passage) is therefore probably minimal in this 
subgroup. Along these lines, our findings corroborate

results from another high profile randomized controlled 
trial reported by Furyk and colleagues,81  which was 
published shortly after the Pickard study.10 This double 
blind, placebo controlled, multicenter trial from Austra-
lia found no benefit overall of treatment with an alpha 
blocker for patients with lower ureteric calculi ≤10 mm 
in terms of spontaneous passage; however, in a pre-
specified subgroup analysis of large stones (5-10 mm), 
use of tamsulosin was associated with significantly 
higher rates of passage.
Regarding location of ureteric stones, our findings 
contrast with those from a rigorous randomized con-
trolled trial conducted by Sur and colleagues.79  Despite 
the fact that use of sildosin achieved a significantly 
greater rate of passage of lower ureteric stones than pla-
cebo, this trial showed no benefit to treatment for 
stones in the upper and middle ureter (because of wide 
confidence intervals around the effect estimates), but 
there was a consistent trend towards benefit. The effects 
of alpha blockers on passage are thought to result from 
relaxation of ureteric smooth muscle mediated by bind-
ing of the drug to alpha adrenergic receptors in the 
region of the stone. Yet, while alpha adrenergic recep-
tors are concentrated in the lower ureter,85  studies have 
shown that they are present along the entire length of 
the human ureter.86 87 Thus, one could anticipate that 
alpha blockers exert their effect throughout the ureter, 
as we found in our pooled analysis.
strengths and weaknesses of study
The strengths of our study include the comprehensive 
nature of our literature search (which included studies 
irrespective of language and publication status); the 
thoroughness of our study selection, data abstraction, 
and risk of bias assessment (carried out in duplicate by 
two independent members of our study team); our pre-
defined analytic plan; and our use of the GRADE 
approach for assessing the quality of evidence on an 
outcome specific basis.
Despite these strengths, several limitations merit dis-
cussion. The first relates to clinical (not statistical) het-
erogeneity between pooled studies, in view of the 
variation in the types of alpha blockers given, the 
inconsistent use of post-treatment imaging, and differ-
ential follow-up. We found, however, that the pooled 
relative risk of passage of ureteric stones was indepen-
dent of these clinical differences. Another limitation 
pertains to the overall methodological rigor of the 
pooled studies. Only a handful concealed allocation 
adequately, and just six studies reported blinding of 
outcome assessment. Given that the inclusion of less 
rigorous studies could lead to misestimation of the true 
intervention effect, we conducted separate sensitivity 
analyses, in which we recalculated our summary esti-
mates excluding data from non-placebo controlled 
studies and those in which the risk of bias was judged 
high. While our summary estimates were attenuated, 
the benefit of alpha blockers persisted. Differences in 
stone passage by type of alpha blocker were not found 
through meta-regression, but this could be because of 
insufficient power. Finally, our results could be affected

by publication bias, whereby smaller studies with neg-
ative results might never have been published. To 
account for this possibility, we repeated our models 
pooling data from only larger studies and found our 
results to be robust.
strengths and weaknesses in relation to other 
studies
Several previous systematic reviews and meta-analyses 
have examined the role of alpha blockers for treatment 
of ureteric stones, most notably the initial study by 
Hollingsworth and colleagues.3  They identified nine 
randomized controlled trials that yielded a pooled risk 
ratio of 1.54 (95% confidence interval 1.29 to 1.85), favor-
ing medical expulsive therapy. The recent Cochrane 
review published by Campshroer and colleagues 
included 32 randomized controlled trials and found a 
48% higher risk of stone passage with treatment with 
alpha blockers than control (risk ratio 1.48, 1.33 to 
1.64).6 Similar to our findings, the benefit of alpha 
blockers was attenuated when the analysis was limited 
to only four placebo controlled trials (1.22, 0.99 to 1.55) 
but consistent with a potentially large effect.
Since the date of the Cochrane group’s last search, we 
identified 24 additional randomized controlled trials on 
alpha blockers for the treatment of ureteric stones. We 
are unaware of any recent high quality systematic 
reviews that include the randomized controlled trial 
from Pickard and colleagues, findings from which have 
called the concept of medical expulsive therapy into 
question.10 Although the Pickard study was large and 
methodologically rigorous in its design, its results need 
to be placed into the context of the entire body of evi-
dence as in a systematic review like ours. We can 
explain the discrepancies in findings largely due to the 
high rate of spontaneous stone passage in the control 
arm of the trial perhaps because of the large proportion 
of patients with smaller stones.
A second important difference between the Pickard 
study and most other randomized controlled trials on 
medical expulsive therapy relates to how stone passage 
was defined. Imaging evidence has been the standard 
assessment, yet investigators in the Pickard study chose 
instead “absence of need for additional interventions to 
assist stone passage at four weeks after randomisa-
tion.”10  Compelling arguments can be made that this 
endpoint is highly relevant to surgeons, but the degree 
to which intervention rates accurately approximate 
spontaneous stone passage is uncertain. While addi-
tional imaging was obtained when “clinically indi-
cated” (such as for continued pain, development of 
infection), just over half of participants were reimaged, 
raising the possibility of silent obstruction and late sec-
ondary complications.88 Further, defining passage by 
the absence of intervention, rightly or wrongly, does not 
reflect routine clinical practice in many countries out-
side the UK, nor does it align with contemporary prac-
tice guidelines from the European Association of 
Urology, under which reimaging is recommended to 
monitor the position of ureteric stones and assess for 
hydronephrosis.
implications for clinicians and policy makers
Findings from our study emphasize the role of system-
atic reviews to examine focused clinical questions. The 
recent publication of the Pickard study brought into 
question the effectiveness of alpha blockers in patients 
with ureteric colic, leading to calls from the urologic 
community to reformulate treatment guidelines and 
even abandon medical expulsive therapy altogether. 
Our findings suggest that this would be an over-reaction 
as large subgroups of patients could be spared from 
stone surgery and its attendant risks with a trial of an 
alpha blocker.
Further, our study highlights the challenges of trials 
with undifferentiated cohorts that often lack the sam-
ple size necessary to tease out important clinical 
nuances. Therefore, while not all patients seen in the 
emergency department for ureteric colic will be helped 
by alpha blockers, our meta-analysis, which draws 
power from the pooling of data across multiple stud-
ies, suggests that those with stones ≥5 mm in size 
could.
Such a size based approach to the use of alpha 
blockers requires patients with suspected ureteric 
stones to undergo radiologic testing. Under current 
guidelines on urolithiasis from the European Associa-
tion of Urology, immediate imaging is indicated in the 
evaluation of all patients who present with acute flank 
pain.2  In many emergency departments, however, par-
ticularly for patients with known histories of urinary 
stone disease, imaging is often deferred until the time 
of primary or specialty care follow-up, which could 
delay initiation of expulsive therapy. Moreover, renal 
ultrasonography is often used as the primary diagnos-
tic tool, from which stone size cannot always be accu-
rately assessed. While a non-contrast computed 
tomogram should be obtained subsequently to con-
firm a stone diagnosis,2 many times it is not. Clearly, 
there are some clinical challenges for the implementa-
tion of our findings.
unanswered questions and future research
Our findings on international differences in the base-
line rates of stone passage suggest that patient related 
factors could modify the effects of expulsive therapy. To 
better assess their role, investigators could consider 
including variables like patient age, sex, and race/eth-
nicity in the design of a large international trial. Future 
studies should also examine patients’ values and pref-
erences concerning acceptable risk of retained ureteric 
stones versus the potential inconvenience, radiation 
exposure, and the direct and indirect costs of repeat 
imaging.
