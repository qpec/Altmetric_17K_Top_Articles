Aims
The PROximal Fracture of the Humerus Evaluation by Randomisation (PROFHER) 
randomised clinical trial compared the operative and non-operative treatment of adults with 
a displaced fracture of the proximal humerus involving the surgical neck. The aim of this 
study was to determine the long-term treatment effects beyond the two-year follow-up.
Patients and Methods
Of the original 250 trial participants, 176 consented to extended follow-up and were sent 
postal questionnaires at three, four and five years after recruitment to the trial. The Oxford 
Shoulder Score (OSS; the primary outcome), EuroQol 5D-3L (EQ-5D-3L), and any recent 
shoulder operations and fracture data were collected. Statistical and economic analyses, 
consistent with those of the main trial were applied.
Results
OSS data were available for 164, 155 and 149 participants at three, four and five years, 
respectively. There were no statistically or clinically significant differences between 
operative and non-operative treatment at each follow-up point. No participant had 
secondary shoulder surgery for a new complication. Analyses of EQ-5D-3L data showed no 
significant between-group differences in quality of life over time.
Conclusion
These results confirm that the main findings of the PROFHER trial over two years are 
unchanged at five years.

We report the five-year follow-up of the
PROximal Fracture of the Humerus Evalua-
tion by Randomisation (PROFHER) trial (trial
registration identifier: ISRCTN50850043).
PROFHER was a pragmatic, multi-centre
randomised controlled trial (RCT), funded
by the United Kingdom National Institute
for Health Research (NIHR), which com-
pared operative and non-operative treatment
of adults with a displaced fracture of the
proximal humerus involving the surgical
neck.1
Between September 2008 and April 2011,
250 adults were recruited into the trial. At
two-year follow-up, the primary outcome and
the Oxford Shoulder Score (OSS)2,3 were avail-
able for 215 participants.4 The results showed
no significant difference between operative
and non-operative treatment by OSS over two
years (p = 0.479) or other patient-reported
clinical outcomes in the two years following
fracture;4,5 and the cost of surgery was consid-
erably greater.6
The initial choice of a two-year follow-up
for PROFHER was a pragmatic one which bal-
anced feasibility and the expectation that any
differences in the OSS between the two treat-
ment groups at two years would represent a
true and enduring effect. However, there is
insufficient evidence from other RCTs to con-
firm this assumption.7 Recovery from serious
injuries such as a fracture of the proximal
humerus is a long and often incomplete process
that can be hindered by complications. A sub-
stantial proportion (15/74, 20%) of partici-
pants in a trial with less severe (‘minimally
displaced two-part’) fractures than in PROF-
HER had continuing ‘severe’ disability after
two years, although less than that at one year
(30/84, 37%).8
We reasoned that a five-year follow-up
would allow for delays in recovery, potential
functional deterioration, and subsequent oper-
ations resulting from complications, such as
avascular necrosis and complications of surgi-
cal fixation or humeral head replacement,

which could arise or become symptomatic later on. The
extension made practical sense as the infrastructure was
already in place and the potential availability of a large
group of patients presented an opportunity to gain reliable
evidence about patient-reported longer term outcome, as
well as insight into the feasibility of future research.
We set up the extended follow-up study at the Yorks Tri-
als Unit, securing ethical approval in September 2010 from
the institution,5 before the end of recruitment to, and with-
out knowing the results of, the first study.
Our primary aim was to obtain three, four and five-year
data on the key outcomes (OSS, EuroQol 5D-3L (EQ-5D-
3L),9 and subsequent surgery) to determine whether the
effect of treatment detected at two-year follow-up had per-
sisted or changed. A further aim, linked to the collection of
EQ-5D-3L data and information about any further surgery,
was to examine the potential effect on our economic
analysis6 of any change in health related quality of life
(HRQoL) and the costs related to this.
Our secondary aims were to generate longer term condi-
tion-specific data on shoulder function that would provide
reference data for the interpretation of the findings of
PROFHER and future studies of proximal humeral frac-
tures and to inform future research in this area on the
appropriate duration of follow-up.
Patients and Methods
The methodology of the main trial is reported elsewhere.1,5
The inclusion and exclusion criteria are shown in Table I.10
The final version of the extended study protocol (version
3.0; 09 August 2012) is published on the NIHR website.11
All related amendments were reviewed and approved by the
Leeds West Research Ethics Committee (08/H1311/12).
Data collection. Postal questionnaires were sent at three,
four and five years after the start of the original trial to the
176 participants who had completed and returned a con-
sent form sent on receipt of their 24-month questionnaire.
A pre-notification letter was sent before this and, when nec-
essary, reminders were sent after two and four weeks, with
the option to complete questionnaires by telephone after six
weeks. To maximise collection of data at the three time
points, patients were asked to complete a short question-
naire restricted to the OSS, EQ-5D-3L, recent operations
on their shoulder, and recent fractures. Patients were also
sent an unconditional £5.00 incentive payment with each
questionnaire. We also collected data from NHS Digital,
using the NHS Summary Care Records available electroni-
cally for authorised staff, on patient mortality at regular
intervals before sending the questionnaires to avoid dis-
tressing bereaved families or friends.
Outcomes. The primary outcome measure was the OSS,
which assesses pain, function and activities of daily liv-
ing.2,3 It contains 12 items, each with five categories of
response, and a range of total scores from 0 (worst out-
come) to 48 (best outcome).3 Secondary outcomes were the
EQ-5D-3L, used to estimate utilities (HRQoL weights),9
further shoulder surgery and further fractures. While mor-
tality was a secondary outcome in the main follow-up, it
was reported solely as a reason for loss to follow-up in the
extended follow-up: mortality and definitive treatment of
the fracture after two years could not reasonably be
expected to be linked and would not anyway be listed as a
cause of death. Overall, the OSS and EQ-5D-3L were col-
lected at six, 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 months; EQ-5D-3L data
were also collected at baseline and three months. Secondary
shoulder surgery and further fractures were collected from
hospital forms at one and two years and from patient ques-
tionnaires at three, four and five years’ follow-up.
Sample size. The main study was designed to detect a
standard effect size of 0.4 (approximating to five OSS
points) with 80% power using 5% significance level, and
needed approximately 200 participants at two years.1 We

Criteria
Inclusion criteria:
Inclusion criteria:
Adults (aged ≥ 16 years) presenting within 3 wks of their injury with a radiologically confirmed displaced fracture of the humerus involving the sur-
gical neck. This should include all two-part surgical neck fractures; three-part (including surgical neck) and four-part fractures of proximal humerus 
(Neer Classification).10 It may also include displaced surgical neck fractures that do not meet the exact displacement criteria of the Neer Classifica-
tion (1 cm or/and 45° angulation of displaced parts) where this reflects an individual surgeon’s uncertainty (e.g. whether, or not, the surgical neck 
fracture should be treated surgically).
Exclusion criteria:
Exclusion criteria:
Associated dislocation of the injured joint of the shoulder.
Open fracture.
Mentally incompetent patient: unable to understand trial procedure or instructions for rehabilitation; significant mental impairment that would 
preclude compliance with rehabilitation and treatment advice.
Comorbidities precluding surgery/anaesthesia.
A clear indication for surgery such as severe soft-tissue compromise requiring surgery/emergency treatment (nerve injury/dysfunction).
Multiple injuries: same limb fractures; other upper limb fractures.
Pathological fractures (other than osteoporotic) and terminal illness.
Participant not resident in catchment area of trauma centre.

assumed a 20% attrition rate at five years and based our
proposal on a final sample size of 160 which would provide
71% power to detect a standard effect size of 0.4 using 5%
significance level. Given the reduced statistical power for
the extended follow-up, significance testing was limited to
the primary outcome alone.
Statistical and economic analyses. All analyses were per-
formed using Stata version 13.1 (StataCorp, College Sta-
tion, Texas) and were on an intention-to-treat basis,
participants being analysed in the groups to which they
were randomised. Significance tests were two-sided at the
5% significance level.
Primary analysis. OSS data from the extended follow-up
time points were added to the primary analysis model of the
PROFHER trial.4 The analysis compared OSS data from
the two treatment groups over all follow-up assessments
using a multilevel regression model. In order to account for
the correlation of outcomes over time from the same
patients, time points were nested within patients. The
model adjusted for the fixed effects of treatment group;
time (six months, one, two, three, four and five years);
interaction between treatment group and time; tuberosity
involvement at baseline (yes or no); age (< 65 years, ≥ 65
years), and gender and health status at baseline (EQ-5D-
3L). The unstructured covariance pattern was retained
from the primary analysis model. Patients with valid OSS
data at one or more follow-up points for the standard or
extended follow-up as well as complete covariate data were
included in the analysis. Estimates of the difference in OSS
between treatment groups, 95% confidence intervals (CI)
and p-values were obtained for the extended follow-up at
three, four and five years.
In a sensitivity analysis, the multilevel model was
repeated substituting missing data with data derived by
multiple imputation by chained equations. Missing out-
come and covariate data were imputed from age, gender,
tuberosity involvement, EQ-5D-3L index at baseline and
available OSS data at other follow-up points.
Subgroup analyses. As with the main trial, the possibility
of differential long-term treatment responses for older

patients (subgroups: < 65 years versus ≥ 65 years) and more
complex fractures (subgroups: involvement of no tuberosi-
ties/one or both tuberosities) was explored. Expectations of
the benefit of surgery over conservative treatment, estab-
lished before the main trial results were known, were that
this was greater in patients < 65 years and in patients with
fractures involving one or both tuberosities,1 and that these
benefits might only emerge in the longer term.11 Unadjusted
mean OSSs by subgroups and treatment arm were therefore
explored. Due to the substantially reduced statistical power
for the subgroups, no statistical testing was performed.
Secondary outcomes. We calculated the annual and overall
frequencies of shoulder surgery and fractures in each
treatment group that had occurred within the previous year.
Extended follow-up data were combined with those of the
main trial to establish the number of participants in each
treatment group who had secondary shoulder surgery or a
further fracture over five years. Free text providing details
of further surgery and non-pre-specified fractures was cat-
egorised by two independent observers (HH and AR), who
were blinded to the treatment group.
Economic analysis. The economic analysis aimed to
explore whether the results from the PROFHER trial were
sustained over a five-year time period by determining the
between-group differences in HRQoL (measured via the
EQ-5D-3L) at set times (three, four and five years) and

examining how this difference evolved over time. We also
planned to estimate costs of any further shoulder surgery
and report these descriptively.
The methods used to process the EQ-5D-3L data and cal-
culate quality-adjusted life years (QALY) scores were the
same as those described in our previous cost-effectiveness
report.6 Briefly, the EQ-5D-3L data were transformed into
‘health-related quality of life weights’ (utilities) using the
United Kingdom general population tariff which assigns
societal values to each health state.12 QALYs were calcu-
lated by combining the utility estimates by the duration of
time in each health state using the area under the curve
method following the trapezium rule which assumed linear
interpolation between follow-up points.13 A discount rate
was applied to QALYs after 12 months, at an annual rate of
3.5%.14
In the main trial, the base-case analysis was conducted for
the imputed dataset by means of multiple imputation with
chained equations, using seemingly unrelated regression
analysis.6 This method accounts for the correlation
between costs and effects from the same individuals and
imputes the missing data. However, other regression-based
methods are available for handling missing data in longitu-
dinal studies, principally mixed models, and results may be
sensitive to the methods used.15 A multilevel model similar
to the primary OSS analysis was therefore conducted to
investigate whether the results obtained in the main trial
were robust to this alternative method of analysis. There-
fore, the mean difference in utilities and QALYs (with 95%
CIs) between the two groups was estimated using a multi-
level model that adjusted for the fixed effects of treatment
group, time (three and six months, one, two, three, four
and five years), interaction between treatment group and
time, tuberosity involvement at baseline, age, gender and
baseline utility.
Uncertainty around the results was explored by means of
sensitivity analysis that used multiple imputation by
chained equations to replace missing data on QALYs in the

naires at two years; 70% of 250 randomised trial partici-
pants) who consented to long-term follow-up at two years
after randomisation, valid OSSs were received for 164
(93%) at three years, 155 (88%) at four years, and 149
(85%) at five years’ follow-up (Fig. 1). Retention was there-
fore slightly lower than anticipated in the extended follow-
up. However, additional power was gained by the multi-
level analysis. A total of ten patients died during the long-
term follow-up, five in each trial arm.
As found at baseline (except for smoking status, which
did not affect the OSS results) and two-year follow-up,4
patient characteristics were balanced between groups at
five-year follow-up in the 149 patients with complete OSS
data (Tables II and III). Furthermore, the characteristics of
the RCT population remained representative, as none of
the baseline characteristics differed meaningfully between
participants at the start of the trial and those remaining at
the end. 
Primary outcome (OSS). Unadjusted OSS outcomes for
patients with valid data were very similar in both groups for
the extended follow-up period (Fig. 2). This featured a trend
of small score increases between two and four years, with lit-
tle difference in the fifth year. OSS scores were skewed
towards maximum OSS shoulder function: over half the
population had stable and satisfactory shoulder function3 at
all three follow-up points: three years (median 42, interquar-
tile range (IQR) 35 to 47.5); four years (median 43, IQR 37
to 48); five years (median 44, IQR 36 to 48).
When adding the long-term OSS follow-up data to the
existing multilevel analysis, group differences were not sta-
tistically significant at any of the long-term follow-up time
points. This was true for the primary analysis model includ-
ing all patients with available outcome data at any time
point as well as the sensitivity analysis including all patients
using data derived by multiple imputation (Tables IV and
V). None of the estimated mean differences was clinically
meaningful; almost all were smaller than one OSS score
point in magnitude with no consistent trend for the direc-
tion of the treatment effect.
The substantial overlap of the confidence intervals for
the unadjusted OSS scores indicate that there were no
marked differences between the treatment groups for the
subgroups based on age (Fig. 3) or tuberosity involvement
(Fig. 4). In both subgroups, the patterns of OSS score dif-
ferences were not consistent with prior expectations.
Secondary outcomes. Only one patient reported further
shoulder surgery during the extended follow-up period.
This was a reverse shoulder replacement in year three in a
non-operative group patient who had already undergone
surgery (arthroscopic capsular release and subacromial
decompression) during the main follow-up. Consequently,
the number of patients who needed secondary surgery
remained at 11 in each treatment group.4
A total of 81 further fractures were reported by 52
patients over the five-year follow-up period. A small num-
ber of fractures are likely to be duplicated from one year to
the next but as this could not be known definitively, patient
data were accepted as submitted, with the exception of one
participant who provided the date of their fracture. There
were more fractures in the non-operative group (50 frac-
tures, 33 patients) than the operative group (31 fractures,
19 patients), especially of the spine and hip (Table VI).
Economic analyses. Inevitably, when compared with the
125 randomised into each treatment group, the extent of
missing EQ-5D-3L data increased considerably in the
extended follow-up period. For the 176 participants who
consented to long-term follow-up, complete EQ-5D-3L
scores were available for 159 (90%) at three years, 153
(86%) at four years and 151 (86%) at five years.
Figure 5 shows the distribution of mean utilities (EQ-5D-
3L scores) for all the available patients across the five years
for the two groups. Patients in the operative group started
from a higher mean baseline utility (0.43; -0.36 to 1, oper-
ative versus 0.38; -0.35 to 1, non-operative). However, at
the end of the second year there was little difference in EQ-
5D-3L scores between treatment groups. This finding was
consistent at three, four and five years with the 95% CIs
overlapping at each assessment point. The same pattern
applied for the analysis of utilities when adjusted for base-
line utility or for all covariates (Table VII).
Between-group mean difference in QALYs based on indi-
vidual patients’ utilities are shown in Table VIII. At the end
of the five years, patients allocated to the non-operative
group generally had a marginally higher QALY gain than

patients allocated to the operative group. Hence the QALY
gain for non-operative patients is maintained over time
whether data are adjusted for baseline utility or for all
covariates. The mixed model was repeated substituting
missing data with data derived by multiple imputation by
chained equations. For both analyses, there were negligible
differences in the QALYs between the two groups at the dif-
ferent follow-up times (Table VIII).
Discussion
The extended follow-up found no statistically or clini-
cally significant differences between operative and non-
operative treatment of displaced fractures of the proxi-
mal humerus involving the surgical neck at three, four or
five years in the OSS, our primary outcome. Nor was
there any trend for group differences relating to age or
fracture type.

These findings mirror those of the main trial.4 No trial
participant had secondary shoulder surgery for a new com-
plication during the extended follow-up period. The
between-group differences in utilities, based on EQ-5D-3L
data, at three, four or five years were very small: the 95%
CIs overlapped at each assessment. The same lack of statis-
tically significant between-group differences applied to the
HRQoL analysis that showed the trend for a QALY gain
for participants in the non-operative group was maintained
over time. Sensitivity analyses indicated minimal differ-
ences between the two groups at each follow-up time.
By exceeding the original target of 200 participants at
two-year follow-up, PROFHER was sufficiently powered
at final follow-up. By contrast, we were 11 short of the 160
participants with OSS data at five years, and therefore did
not meet the revised statistical power criteria for the
extended follow-up. However, we believe this is unlikely to
affect the validity of the results. First, loss to follow-up,
including identical mortality (five in each group), was bal-
anced in the two groups. Secondly, baseline characteristics
at five years were comparable between groups as well as
being representative of the original population. Thirdly,
much of the missing data were accounted for in the multi-
level analysis, which included 231 patients. Fourthly, the
between-group differences were small: the 95% CIs at each
follow-up time were less than the minimal clinically impor-
tant difference of five points. Fifthly, the between-group
differences in the EQ-5D-3L were also very small, again
reflecting comparability of the groups. Finally, there were
no new complications warranting surgery.
Although there were no cost data to replicate the incre-
mental cost-effectiveness analysis conducted for the PROF-
HER trial, the analyses of the health utility data for the five-
year period produced results that are consistent with the
main trial analysis:6 in general, patients allocated to surgery
reported lower HRQoL. The very small differences in
HRQoL between the two groups found for the mixed
model and multiple imputation analyses indicate negligible
differences in quality of life between the treatment groups.

extended follow-up would not have affected the findings of
the main trial.
We consider that it is unsafe to draw any conclusions
from the observed differences in participants incurring fur-
ther fractures between the two groups on the basis of treat-
ment group. We suggest that this is primarily a chance
effect. In terms of known risk factors for fractures (such as
higher age, female gender, previous fracture and smoking),
the two groups were at similar risk of further fracture at
baseline except for smoking status, where there was a

higher incidence of smokers in the non-operative group.
This may partly explain a higher number of fractures in
that group. Known inaccuracies, relating to both under-
and over-reporting, of self-reported fractures16 are of some
concern and indeed, based on additional participant com-
mentary, we have confirmed one instance of duplicate
reporting over time. We also have no information about
whether there was any difference in the advice offered and
medication provided for preventing further fractures in the
two groups.
Our findings of an absence of treatment differences on
the OSS in the extended follow-up underpin the main find-
ings for the two-year follow-up. The only case of further
surgery over the extended follow-up was further surgery for
a patient who had already had surgery for a complication
that occurred within the two-year follow-up.5 Given that
most (15 of 22) secondary surgery occurred in the first year,
this finding and the lack of difference in the OSS provide
reassurance that late symptomatic complications are rare.
The HRQoL results show that the PROFHER economic
analysis was applicable over a five-year period. The overall
OSS results show that most patients had attained satisfac-
tory shoulder function by two years: this was subsequently
sustained. Therefore, the two-year follow-up would have
been sufficient for the PROFHER trial, and this finding
could inform the length of follow-up for future RCTs on
these fractures.
Take home message:
- The results of the extended follow-up underpin the main find-
ings of the PROFHER trial.
- There was no significant difference in patient-reported outcome
between operative and non-operative treatment for the majority of adults
with proximal humeral fractures involving the surgical neck.
