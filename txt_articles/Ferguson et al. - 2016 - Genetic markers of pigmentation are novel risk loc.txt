While the role of genetic risk factors in the etiology of uveal melanoma (UM) has been strongly 
suggested, the genetic susceptibility to UM is currently vastly unexplored. Due to shared 
epidemiological risk factors between cutaneous melanoma (CM) and UM, in this study we have selected 
28 SNPs identified as risk variants in previous genome-wide association studies on CM or CM-related 
host phenotypes (such as pigmentation and eye color) and tested them for association with UM risk.  
By logistic regression analysis of 272 UM cases and 1782 controls using an additive model, we identified 
five variants significantly associated with UM risk, all passing adjustment for multiple testing. The three 
most significantly associated variants rs12913832 (OR = 0.529, 95% CI 0.415–0.673; p = 8.47E-08), 
rs1129038 (OR = 0.533, 95% CI 0.419–0.678; p = 1.19E-07) and rs916977 (OR = 0.465, 95% CI 0.339–
0.637; p = 3.04E-07) are correlated (r2 > 0.5) and map at 15q12 in the region of HERC2/OCA2, which 
determines eye-color in the human population. Our data provides first evidence that the genetic factors 
associated with pigmentation traits are risk loci of UM susceptibility.
Uveal melanoma (UM) is the most common primary adult intraocular cancer1,2 with relatively unclear etiology, 
although some specific risk factors, such as ethnicity or eye/skin pigmentation traits, have been suggested3. Our 
previous studies show that about 12% of UM manifest as a highly penetrant familial syndrome, often involving a 
variety of other cancers including cutaneous melanoma (CM)4,5, suggesting that genetic susceptibility likely plays 
an important role in the etiology of UM. Despite this, currently known highly penetrant germline mutations in 
BAP1, CDKN2A, or BRCA2 explain only about 3% of UM population-specific risk6–9. Thus, developing clinically 
relevant UM risk prediction models that account for both genetic and host factors is currently difficult, also 
because of a vastly unexplored role of low-penetrant genetic risk factors in the general UM population. Unlike 
other solid tumors, no genome-wide association study (GWAS) data exists for UM as large sample cohorts for 
this rare cancer are generally unavailable. Although CM and UM have distinct somatic genetic characteristics that 
reflect different melanocytic origin3,10,11, the co-occurrence of CM and UM in a subset of affected families sug-
gests a shared predisposition to both cancer types5. Recently, a number of genetic variants have been reproducibly 
associated in GWASs with the risk of CM and skin/eye pigmentation traits (Supplementary Table 1). The shared 
etiological risk factors between CM and UM (including pigmentation) suggest that a subset of CM risk variants 
would associate with genetic susceptibility to UM.

Results and Discussion
Herein, we analyzed 28 SNPs (one SNP did not pass genotype filtering) established in recent GWASs for asso-
ciation with CM or related host phenotypes (including skin and eye pigmentation) (Supplementary Table 1), in 
a population of 272 UM patients and 760 controls that were of European ancestry (Supplementary Table 2). In 
addition, to increase the statistical power, we have included genotyped data of 1047 controls from a publically 
available GWAS (phs000187.v1.p1)12. Logistic regression analysis adjusted by age and gender revealed a novel 
association with reduced UM risk in the locus of HERC2/OCA2 at 15q13 for 3 correlated SNPs (r2 > 0.5), which 
were still significant following adjustment for multiple testing (Table 1, full results in Supplementary Table 3): 
 
rs12913832 (OR = 
 0.529, 95% CI 0.415–0.673; p = 
 8.47E-08), rs1129038 (OR = 
 0.533, 95% CI 0.419–0.678; 
p = 
 1.19E-07) and rs916977 (OR = 
 0.465, 95% CI 0.339–0.637; p = 
 3.04E-07). All three SNPs were previously 
found to be associated in GWAS with both eye pigmentation13 and CM risk12,14. Similarly, the strongest effect 
has been observed in both phenotypes for rs12913832. The directionality and magnitude of odds ratios for all 
three SNPs reported for CM and UM risk are similar (for rs12913832 OR = 
 0.69 versus 0.53, respectively), fur-
ther suggesting that pigmentation is a shared etiological risk factor between both diseases. The associations with 
UM risk remained comparably significant after adjustment for family history of other cancers (including family 
history of CM), personal history of CM or major UM subtypes (for rs12913832: p = 
 7.08E-06, p = 
 1.23E-06 and 
p = 
 3.06E-06, respectively). To further test the robustness of these findings we also performed association analysis 
of Ohio State University Medical Center (OSUMC) cases against other independent control populations from 
recent GWASs that were publically available (Supplementary Table 4). As shown, the associations remained com-
parably significant for each control set as well as in the pooled aggregate analysis.
The locus at 15q13.1 determines pigmentation of eyes and skin by regulating the expression of OCA2, which 
codes for P protein involved in melanin synthesis15. Prior functional data show that our most significant variant 
rs12913832 in the intronic region of HERC2, is a key pigmentation “regulator allele” that impacts the expression 
of OCA2 via a long range enhancer mechanism16. The less common T-allele (darker eye color) of rs12913832, 
associated with UM-protective effect in our data, enhances OCA2 expression resulting in darkly pigmented mel-
anocytes. The C-allele conversely reduces expression of OCA2 producing lightly colored melanocytes16. Taking 
this functional data together with our findings suggests that genetic determinants of dark eye pigmentation are 
protective while lighter pigmentation alleles confer a risk effect on UM3,17. Importantly, these genetic observations 
are also in clear alignment with previous epidemiological studies demonstrating that light eye color is indeed a 
UM risk factor (OR = 1.75 95% CI 1.31–2.34 p = < 
0.001)18.
In an attempt to explore other possible genetic loci with UM-specific regulatory function, we have also 
performed an imputation analysis of associations at the HERC2/OCA2 region. While we found no other asso-
ciation surpassing the effect of rs12913832 (Fig. 1, Table 1 and Supplementary Table 3), interestingly, imputed 
data showed an association signal, albeit with reduced significance, for another correlated variant, rs1667394 
(r2 = 
 0.48) (Supplementary Table 5), that was also previously identified in a GWAS for association with eye 
color19,20. While the data with imputed variants confine the association locus to a narrow ~250 kb region at 
HERC2/OCA2, none of the associations remained statistically significant after conditioning the analysis for 
rs12913832 (data not shown). This suggests that all observed associations at HERC2/OCA2 stem from a signal 
driven by rs12913832. These findings together with prior established functional data on rs12913832 and eye 
pigmentation16 indicate that this is the strongest candidate to be biologically relevant in UM development. 
There is, however, a large degree of correlation among the associated genotyped variants that served as input for 
imputation analysis at HERC2/OCA2. As such, more focused physical fine-mapping in this locus needs to be 
performed to rule out the presence of additional biologically impactful UM-specific loci that are independent 
of rs12913832.
It is important to note that our study has limited power and hence may reduce the ability to detect associations 
exerting smaller risk effects. It is possible that there are other associations among the selected variants that are 
likely missed in this study due to relatively small size of our UM case population. The most significant associations 
at HERC2/OCA2 locus (Table 1), as well as rs12203592 in IRF4, all show odds ratios < 
0.6 or > 
1.4, respectively 
(Table 1). As we estimated, to detect such risk effect magnitude given the current case/control sample size, our

study has > 
95% power (under MAF> 
0.05, alpha = 8.9E-04). However, the power rapidly drops for the expected 
effect size of OR < 
 1.3 (approximately 40% power reduction). Hence, to provide a true estimate of potential risk 
effect with smaller size for remaining subset of variants in our selection, a larger study will be needed as part of 
national or international consortia. As part of such collaborative efforts, the consideration of additional covar-
iates such as pigmentation phenotypes in studied populations would be essential, as in the current study, while 
important, this data was not available.
Also, the relatively small size of our case population did not allow for stratifying the associations by the 
primary location of tumors, and this will need to be explored in subsequent large consortia analyses. The 
molecular effect of pigmentation on different UM subtypes has recently been suggested, as different GNAQ 
mutation signatures were observed in posterior (choroid) versus anterior UM tumors (ciliary body, iris), 
likely reflecting divergent UM pathways related to toxic pheomelanin synthesis17. This molecular support for 
a role of melanin in UM histologies and the association of germline variants of eye color with UM risk found 
in this study suggest interplay between both somatic and inherited factors of pigmentation pathways in UM 
development.
A limitation in this study is an inability to assess the effect of pigmentation phenotype information in our 
sample populations as the HERC2/OCA2 locus exerts a purifying selection effect in European ancestries21,22. 
Our analysis employed a set of control subjects matched by geographical location, age and gender to the 
cases, ascertained at OSUMC and an additional US control population of white ancestry (ascertained at MD 
Anderson). Both control sets show comparable allele frequencies of HERC2/OCA2 variants, indicating simi-
larities in distribution of pigmentation in both control sets. Also, it has been previously demonstrated that the 
distribution of pigmentation variants, including rs12913832, in European populations along a north-south 
axis often manifests with significant Hardy Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) departures, likely as reult of under-
lying selection pressure for these alleles22. Although the HWE test does not inform on the population strat-
ification, the fact that these pigmentation alleles are in HWE in both control sets used here (separately or in 
aggregate) further suggests that misbalanced distribution of pigmentation traits potentially confounding our 
findings, is unlikely.
The identification of novel germline genetic loci involved in UM susceptibility in our study provides the first 
evidence of a link between the inherited genetics of pigmentation and UM risk. It has been established that 
lighter pigmentation and chronic sun exposure impact the development of choroid nevi, which occur in 
~7% of the US population and are a known precursor for UM23. Testing the associations in this study in the 
context of UM risk and the presence of ocular nevi will also be important in future analyses. Complementing 
our findings with other high-risk loci (e.g. BAP1) will further expand the clinical implications for both UM 
risk-prediction and biological understanding of pigmentation in UM etiology.

associations at the HERC2/OCA2 locus identified in this study were analyzed using imputation-based fine 
mapping. The genotyped variants (diamonds) were imputed (circles) with an INFO score > 
0.5. The strength of 
association with UM risk is displayed as [−

according to LD with rs12913832 calulated from 1000 Genomes Project Phase 3 using the data from European 
ancestry population (N = 503). Associations were noted for imputed variant, rs1667394 (r2 = 0.48 with 
rs12913832), previously reported in a GWAS on eye color19.

Methods
Study population. 
For cases, the study originally employed 286 UM patients. Fourteen of these failed the 
genotyping or quality control, resulting in 272 UM cases available for association analysis. The vast majority of 
patients were ascertained from the ophthalmology, medical oncology or clinical cancer genetics clinics at Ohio 
State University. Four patients were referred to our research program from an outside institute. UM patients 
with family history of UM were excluded. The study was approved by The Ohio State University cancer insti-
tutional review board. DNA for patients and controls were extracted from peripheral blood lymphocytes by a 
simple salting out procedure24. Seventy-three patients, including two with tumors of the iris, were treated by 
enucleation and the remaining by local therapy, mostly brachytherapy. Basic demographic data such as age at 
diagnosis, sex and ethnicity were collected for each patient. Personal history and a three generation family history 
of cancers were also collected from each patient. Personal history of other cancers was confirmed by medical 
records and or pathology. Family history of cancers was confirmed whenever possible. Most of the diagnoses in 
this study represented choroidal or ciliochoroidal UM (n = 
 253) with a smaller fraction of the iris UM (n = 
 16). 
From 272 cases, n = 
 133 were males [median age 59 (Range: 24–84 years)] and n = 
 139 were females [median age 
59 (Range: 18–84 years)]. The detailed clinical and demographic information is summarized in Supplementary 
Table 2. Control samples were provided by the OSUMC Human Genetics Sample Bank. The Columbus Area 
Controls Sample Bank is a collection of control samples for use in human genetics research that includes donors’ 
anonymized biological specimens and linked phenotypic data. The data and samples are collected under the 
protocol “Collection and Storage of Controls for Genetics Research Studies”
, which is approved by the Biomedical 
Sciences Institutional Review Board (IRB) at OSUMC. The methods in this study were carried out in accordance 
with guidelines set forth by IRB at NYUMC relating to the use of patient samples in genetic studies. Recruitment 
takes place in OSUMC primary care and internal medicine clinics. All individuals included provided written 
informed consent, completed a questionnaire that includes demographic, medical and family history informa-
tion, and donated a blood sample.
Out of available specimens from 3500 participants currently ascertained by OSUMC Human Genetic Sample 
bank, for our analysis we selected 760 controls that were individually matched as closely as possible to cases by 
gender and age (Supplementary Table 2). The DNA specimens from the controls were obtained from peripheral 
blood. Twenty five of the 760 controls failed the genotyping or quality controls, leaving 735 controls available 
for the association analysis. All cases and controls were of European ancestry, and the ethnicity information was 
determined based on self-reported ancestry. Additional controls, proximal to OSUMC case/control subsets, were 
used in the study from publically available GWAS data on cutaneous melanoma ascertained at MD Anderson 
Cancer Center (n = 1047 controls, phs000187.v1.p1)12.
Selection of SNPs and genotyping. 
To test the association of common genetic variants (MAF > 
 0.05) 
with the risk of UM, a total of 29 SNPs were selected through the comprehensive search of published GWAS data 
on melanoma risk, nevi-driven phenotypes, pigmentation, hair color, skin color and other melanoma risk etiol-
ogies. The selection criteria focused on variants with the most significant associations (in particular those sur-
passing GWAS level of significance) reported from each of these published GWAS. The complete list of selected 
variants with association information from prior studies is in Supplementary Table 1.
For the genotyping of 29 selected variants, the highly multiplexed Sequenom MassARRAY system (Agena 
Bioscience Inc, CA) was used according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Quality control (QC) measures included 
duplicates (8 per each 384-well plate) and non-template controls (2 per plate) resulting in > 
99% observed con-
cordance with no evidence of cross-contamination. Post-genotyping filtering criteria were as follows: exclusion 
of SNPs with minor allele frequency (MAF) < 
5%, exclusion of SNPs with a call rate < 
95%, exclusion of sam-
ples with a call rate < 
95%, and exclusion of SNPs with significant departure from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium 
(p < 
 0.001). The filtering steps excluded one variant with MAF < 
 0.05, resulting in genotype information on 28 
variants for 272 UM patients and 735 matched controls.
Statistical analysis. 
The association of UM risk with the selected 29 common genetic variants in the analysis 
of 272 cases and 1782 controls was estimated as odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI), using 
unconditional logistic regression in an additive model where two copies of the minor allele have twice the effect 
of one copy. The genotype model (separate indicators for heterozygotes and rare homozygotes), dominant model 
(indicator for heterozygotes and rare homozygotes combined) and recessive model (indicator for homozygotes) 
were also assessed but not reported as they presented no significant additional information not captured by the 
additive model. All models were adjusted for continuous age at diagnosis (cases) or at the time of inclusion in the 
study (controls) and gender. Deviations of the genotype frequencies in the controls from those expected under 
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium were evaluated by χ2 tests (1 degree of freedom). All analyses were performed in 
PLINK25. For genetic variants not present in publically available controls we have used the nearest proxy (r2 = 1) 
determined from European ancestries in the recent data release of 1000 Genomes Project Phase 3 (October 2014), 
as indicated in Supplementary Table 3. Throughout the study, the general adjustment for multiple testing has 
been applied using Bonferroni correction. Under conservative assumption of 56 independent tests (28 variants 
analyzed in two independent analyses: OSUMC only and pooled case/control association test) the Bonferroni 
adjusted p-value threshold in the study was p < 8.9E-04 (0.05/56).
Imputation. 
IMPUTE2 was used for imputation26 with the 1000 Genomes Phase 3 integrated vari-
ant set as the reference panel (October 2014). Imputation was performed jointly for the OSUMC set and MD 
Anderson control set to ensure uniform information content. Thus, only genotyped variants also present in MD 
Anderson data were considered for input to imputation. Furthermore, we required that the input variants pass 
the post-genotyping criteria described above to maximize information content quality. This left all 8 genotyped

variants in HERC2/OCA2 locus to be used for inference. Based on these SNPs, an approximately 2MB window 
encompassing the HERC2/OCA2 locus was imputed. This region contained 6591 variants in the reference panel 
after filtering to variants common in the European ancestry population (EUR MAF > 
 0.05). Imputed variants 
with IMPUTE2 INFO score > 
0.5 were considered for further analysis resulting in 235 additional variants.
The imputed variants were tested for UM association using logistic regression implemented by the SNPTEST 
software under an additive model. Genotype uncertainties from imputation were accounted for in the model 
using genotype dosages. Notably, there were a number of variants comparably significant to our top genotyped 
associations (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 5). To assess if these were independent signals, SNPTEST was used 
to perform conditional logistic regression based on rs12913832 for all genotyped and imputed HERC2/OCA2 
variants again with an additive model and using genotype dosages to account for genotype uncertainty.
