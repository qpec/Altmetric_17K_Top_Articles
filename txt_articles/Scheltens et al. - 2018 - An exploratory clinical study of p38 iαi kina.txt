Abstract
Objective: The aim of this study was to preliminarily evaluate an oral small
molecule p38a kinase inhibitor in patients with early Alzheimer’s disease (AD)
for the effects on brain amyloid plaque load and episodic memory function, and
to establish pharmacokinetic–pharmacodynamics correlations if any effects iden-
tified on these parameters. Methods: Sixteen patients with early AD received a
highly selective p38a inhibitor (neflamapimod) for 84 days (12 weeks). To
obtain a broad range of plasma drug exposures, subjects randomized to receive
either 40 mg (n = 9) or 125 mg (n = 7) twice daily. Dynamic, 11C-PiB positron
emission scans were performed at baseline and at Day 84 and quantitatively ana-
lyzed by reference parametric mapping. Episodic memory assessed as Wechsler
Memory Scale (WMS) immediate and delayed recall composites. Result: In the
11C-PiB analyses there were no main group level effects, though in the prespeci-
fied responder analysis (>7% reduction in 11C-PiB signal) there were three
responders in the 40 mg, and one in the 125 mg group. There were statistically
significant increases from baseline in mean WMS immediate recall score and
WMS delayed recall at both day 28 (P = 0.03 and P = 0.001) and day 84
(P = 0.001 and P < 0.001). Individual subject plasma drug concentration pro-
files were significantly positively correlated with the change in combined WMS
immediate and delayed recall (P < 0.0001, r2 = 0.70). Within-subject effect size
was 0.59 for immediate recall and 0.67 for delayed recall. Interpretation: Selec-
tive p38a inhibition in patients with early AD may improve episodic memory
and potentially impact b-amyloid production. These preliminary clinical find-
ings support conduct of a longer duration placebo-controlled study, particularly
to confirm the effects on episodic memory function.
Introduction
A broad range of preclinical studies indicates that the
alpha isoform of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase
(p38a kinase) is a robust therapeutic target for Alzhei-
mer’s disease (AD).1–5 Traditionally p38a kinase is con-
sidered
to
be
an
inflammation-related
target
as
microglial p38a promotes production of proinflamma-
tory
cytokines6
and
modulates

activation
state,7,8 and in the healthy state p38a expression within
neurons is low.9 However, more recent findings indicate
that neuronal p38a is increased in disease and under
stress, and neuronal p38a expression has been implicated
in amyloid-beta and/or inflammation-induced synaptic
dysfunction,10–14 specifically impaired synaptic plasticity.
Consistent with the biology of neuronal p38a, selective
small molecule inhibitors of p38a rapidly (i.e., within 2–
3 weeks) reverse spatial learning defects in the APP/PS1
mouse model,15 aged rats16 and in tauopathy (hTau)
mouse model.17

 Neflamapimod (previously code-named VX-745)18 is a
highly selective oral small molecule inhibitor of p38a that
after oral administration in animals achieves brain concen-
trations that are ~twofold higher than in blood.16,19,20 Fol-
lowing phase 1 studies in healthy volunteers and a phase
2a study in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, neflamapi-
mod was repositioned as a CNS therapeutic.16 The pri-
mary preclinical animal pharmacology study was in aged
rats, where the cognitive deficits are considered to result
from interleukin-1 beta (IL-1b) induced impairment of
synaptic plasticity. In that study, neflamapimod reversed
spatial learning deficits in the Morris-Water-Maze test16
and at the highest dose level also reduced hippocamapal
IL-1b protein levels. In a pilot study in Tg2576 (Swedish
mutation APP) transgenic mice that was conducted prior
to the aged rats study, 2 weeks neflamapimod treatment
also showed strong trends toward reduced hippocampal
amyloid plaque levels.16 Plasma drug concentrations were
measured in the preclinical studies and correlated with
prior animal and clinical results to determine the doses
utilized in this study, with 40 mg twice daily projected to
be the therapeutic dose level for effects cognition and
amyloid plaque levels, whereas 125 mg twice daily pro-
jected to be the dose for effects on cytokine production.
Our objectives in this first clinical study of neflamapi-
mod in patients with AD were to ascertain safety and to
screen for potentially relevant pharmacological in the
brain and/or clinical activity. As at the time of the study
was initiated, the understanding of the role of p38a in
brain was primarily around its activity in microglia,
including
potential
effects
on
modulating
microglia-
mediated amyloid clearance, we chose brain amyloid pla-
que levels by PET scan as the primary objective. However,
there was already preliminary evidence suggesting a role
of neuronal p38a in AD-related synaptic dysfunction, and
so we also decided to evaluate cognitive function, espe-
cially episodic memory.
Patients and Methods
Study design
This was a single center (VU University Medical Center,
Amsterdam, Netherlands) double-blind dose-controlled
clinical study. Sixteen subjects were planned for enroll-
ment. No sample size calculations were performed as no
comparisons between dose groups was planned. Subjects
were randomized to receive either 40 mg or 125 mg twice
daily to provide sufficient range of plasma drug levels to
perform pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamics analyses if
drug effects were demonstrated.
Diagnosis and main criteria for inclusion: Male or
female subjects age 60–85 years with either mild cognitive
impairment due to AD or mild AD, with demonstrated
elevated brain amyloid plaque load, and a Mini-Mental
State Examination (MMSE) score between 20 and 28.
The study was conducted under the Competent Author-
ity in the Netherlands, the CCMO. The protocol and
informed consent form was reviewed by, and approval
granted by the VU Medical Center Medical Review Ethics
Committee
(Medisch
Ethische
Toetsings
Commissie,
METc). All patients signed the METc approved informed
consents form prior to participation in the study. The trial
was registered at clinicaltrials.gov prior to study start
(NCT024231220), and with EudraCT as protocol 2014-
002855-25.
Assessments
The dynamic amyloid PET scanning method of van Ber-
ckel and colleagues at the VU Medical Center was fol-
lowed.21 In this method, dynamic emission scanning
consists of 23 frames with progressive increases in frame
duration
(1 9 15,
3 9 5,
3 9 10,
2 9 30,
3 9 60,
2 9 150, 2 9 300, and 7 9 600 sec) for a total scan
duration of 90 min followed by a full quantitative data
analysis of the images. Image analysis was performed uti-
lizing a parametric method based on the simplified refer-
ence tissue method (SRTM2, also known as RPM2)22 and
the PET signal is reported as BPND (binding potential,
nondisplacable), according to standard nomenclature.23
To provide a reference to other clinical trials, where gen-
erally the more simply to acquire, but semiquantitative
Standard Uptake Value ratio (SUVr) is utilized, the
images were also analyzed using SUVr relative to cerebel-
lar gray matter from 60 to 90 min.
Resting state fMRI and MEG were conducted to gain
performance data in advance of potential inclusion in
future studies (see Data S1).
The Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS) included evalua-
tions of both immediate recall and delayed recall utilizing
WMS-IV� by Pearson Clinical. The WMS was adminis-
tered in Dutch at baseline (Day 1, first dose administra-
tion)
and
at

drug
administration. Standardized MMSE (Version 2.0) was
also applied in Dutch, and administered at screening and
Day 1 predosing, and on Days 28, 56, and 84 during
study drug administration.
Plasma drug concentrations were determined utilizing a
LC-MS/MS assay at Charles River Laboratories, Edinburgh.
Statistical methods
All analyses were defined in a Statistical Analysis Plan that
was developed and implemented during the first half of
patient
enrollment.

 variable in the study cortical-specific11C-PiB binding (i.e.,
BPND) by 90 min dynamic PET scanning, evaluated as
percentage change from Baseline to Day 84 in cortical
specific 11C-PiB binding (i.e. BPND) by 90 min dynamic
PET scanning and number and proportion of responders
(>7% reduction in BPND). Due to the nonsymmetrical
nature of the change from baseline values, a nonparamet-
ric approach, Wilcoxon signed rank test was used in the
percentage change analysis. The response criterion was
based on the published within subject variability in test–
retest conditions of 2–3% with reference parametric map-
ping of dynamic22-PiB PET scanning. For MMSE and
WMS, as the evaluation was to screen for improvement,
the null hypothesis was no improvement (rather than no
change), and therefore within-subject change in these
measures were assessed with a one-sided Wilcoxon sign
rank test. The episodic memory components of the WMS
were analyzed as composite measures of immediate and
delayed recall. WMS immediate recall composite score at
each testing sessions consisted of the sum of the scores
on Logical Memory (Logical Memory) I, Verbal Paired
Associates (VPA) I, and Visual Reproduction (VR) I.
WMS delayed recall composite score consisted of the sum
of LM II, VPA II, and VR II.
The area under plasma drug time (0–12 h)–concentra-
tion curve (AUC0–12) was derived for each subject from a
population pharmacokinetic analysis that incorporated
sparse sampling in this study and intensive sampling from
another
neflamapimod
study
in
early
AD
(NCT02423200). Linear
regression (y = bx) was per-
formed to evaluate the impact of plasma drug concentra-
tion on WMS outcome.
Results
Baseline subject characteristics
Sixteen patients were enrolled (9 randomized to 40 mg; 7–
125 mg). For efficacy analyses, data on 15 patients were
available as one patient developed MRI-induced panic
attack on the last study visit and could not complete either
PET scan or cognitive testing. Seven men and two women
were enrolled in the 40 mg group and three men and four
women in 125 mg dose group. The median age at baseline
was 66.5 years (range: 60–76); and the median baseline
MMSE score was 24 (range: 20–28; median 23 and 24 in
40 mg and 125 mg groups, respectively). None of the
patients received concomitant symptomatic AD therapy.
11C-PiB PET scan results
There were minor trends in percentage change on 11C-
PiB binding with the median (mean) percentage change
in global cortical BPND values being �4.57% (�5.36%) in
the 40 mg group and +4.57% (+5.39%) in the 125 mg
group (Fig. 1A). The responder analysis of global cortical
amyloid plaque load (Fig. 1B) demonstrated four of 15
subjects (26.7%) meeting the predefined definition of
response with >7% reduction in BPND, including three of
eight subjects in the 40 mg group and one of seven sub-
jects in the 125 mg group. Percentage reduction in global
cortical BPND in the three responders in the 40 mg dose
group was �11.6%, �11.9%, and �40.5%, respectively,
and in the one responder in the 125 mg dose group was
�7.7%. Interestingly, the responder in the 125 mg dose
group was the subject with the lowest plasma drug levels
in that group. Additional exploratory analysis (Fig. 2A)
showed that responses (≥7% reduction) were limited to
subjects who had baseline BPND less than 0.9. To provide
a comparison to other studies, we analyzed the 11C-PiB
results utilizing the Standardized Uptake Value ratio
(SUVr; Fig. 2B). The results were similar although not
identical to those utilizing reference parametric mapping,
with confirmation that the three responders by the prior
analysis in the 40 mg dose group also showing reductions
in brain amyloid plaque levels of �15%, �16.3% and
�21.8% by the SUVr analysis; however, the BPND respon-
der in the 125 mg dose group had a only �1% change in
the SUVr analysis.
Episodic memory
Episodic memory is considered to be a direct measure of
synaptic dysfunction in the hippocampus and the most
clinically relevant measure of disease progression in early
AD.24,25 In this study episodic memory was assessed
through immediate and delayed recall composites of com-
ponents of the WMS. Mean WMS immediate recall com-
posite scores (range: 0–136) increased from 48.4 � 3.8
(SEM) at baseline to 58.4 � 4.3 at Day 84 (Fig. 3A,
P = 0.005 by one-sided Wilcoxon sign rank test for
improvement). Mean WMS delayed recall composite
scores
increased
from
13.2 � 2.3
at
baseline
to
22.1 � 4.1 at Day 84 (Fig. 3B, P < 0.001). All subcompo-
nents of WMS episodic memory composites showed
improvement (P < 0.05) at Day 84 (Table 1). No changes
were observed in the Symbol Span component of WMS,
the
component
that
does
not
depend
on
episodic
memory.
PK-PD modeling of the WMS data utilizing a simple
linear regression model (y = bx) indicated that plasma
drug concentration area-under-curve over the 12-h dosing
interval (AUC0–12) of neflamapimod were strongly corre-
lated with change in combined WMS immediate and
delayed recall score from baseline to Day 84 (Fig. 3c,
r2 = 0.70, P < 0.0001 for AUC0–12 being predictor of

 change in combined WMS immediate/delayed recall),
supporting a true drug effect of neflamapimod on episo-
dic memory. To further evaluate the effect on episodic
memory, we calculated the within-subject effect size (ES;
i.e., cohen’s d) for improvement from baseline to Day 84
for the episodic memory composites. For immediate recall
the ES was 0.59 and for delayed recall the ES was 0.67.
Additional outcomes
MMSE scores were generally stable, and for the study as a
whole marginally improved (Table S1). Plasma biomark-
ers (tau, neurofilament light chain, brain-derived nerve
growth factor), MRI atrophy measures, fMRI, and MEG-
based functional connectivity measures were assessed for
purposes of planning for future clinical studies. These
measures showed either no change or minor changes con-
sistent with disease progression (Tables S2–S6). For exam-
ple, median change in normalized brain volume by MRI
was �0.56% in the 40 mg dose group and �0.4% in the
125 mg dose group, both consistent with expectations of
approximately 3% annual decline in brain volume in an
early AD patient population.26,27
Safety
No clinically relevant safety signals were identified in this
study, with no severe, serious, or adverse events resulting
in discontinuation of study drug reported during the
study. The most common adverse event was diarrhea
reported in three subjects, all within the 40 mg dose
group; two of these events were mild in severity, with the
3rd event, that was moderate in severity, considered as
not related as the event did not recur during an addi-
tional 56 days treatment after a brief treatment interrup-
tion. Abnormal laboratory values were infrequent and no
consistent trend on any laboratory parameter was evident.
Discussion
The means by which p38a kinase have been theorized to
impact AD disease progression broadly fall into three cat-
egories1–5: (1) as an anti-inflammatory through reducing
proinflammatory cytokine production from immune cells,

promoting

and

reversing
inflammation and/or amyloid-beta induced synaptic dys-
function, particularly impaired synaptic plasticity in the
hippocampus. The first mechanism (i.e., inhibition of
proinflammatory cytokine production) is the classical
drug effect of p38a kinase inhibitors that formed the basis
for evaluating this class of inhibitors for rheumatoid
arthritis and other peripheral inflammatory disorders.
With neflamapimod, assessment of its anti-inflammatory
activity in the CNS was conducted in a separate phase 2a
study
(NCT02423200),
in
which
CSF
inflammatory
cytokines were measured. The results of that study, which
were limited by levels of the primary cytokine targets of
p38a being below the limit of detection and/or quantita-
tion, will be reported separately. In the current study, we
assessed the other two mechanisms, that is, effects on
amyloid plaque clearance and/or synaptic dysfunction.
The results of this study did not support our primary
postulated effect of p38a kinase inhibition on amyloid
plaque clearance, as there were no consistent effects on
brain amyloid plaque load in the main group level analy-
sis. However, there were apparent reductions in amyloid
plaque load in a subset of patients with lower baseline
amyloid plaque load. In particular, as within subject vari-
ability in BPND is less than 3% between two PET
scans,21,22 the three responder subjects in the 40 mg dose
group are highly likely to have had significant reductions
in brain amyloid plaque load during the study. We
believe these reduction in brain amyloid plaque load are
consistent with the scientific reports published during and
after the conduct of the study that indicates neuronal
p38a through modulating autophagy-lysosome protein
degradation appears to play a “critical role” in amyloid
beta generation and plaque production.28,29 Moreover, a
very recent publication indicates that genetic knockout of
neuronal p38a in AD-transgenic mice prevents both the
development of amyloid plaque pathothology and synap-
tic dysfunction and memory loss.30 Accordingly, we
hypothesize that any effects on amyloid plaque load evi-
dent would be due to inhibition of p38a within the neu-
ron leading to a decrease in amyloid plaque production,
rather than an effect on p38a within microglia. The
heterogeneous response within the active 40 mg dose
group could be explained with a model in which there is
consistent reduction in amyloid plaque production due to
a direct pharmacological effect on amyloid-beta genera-
tion, but only patients with efficient endogenous clearance
would demonstrate reduction in brain amyloid plaque
load. Consistent with this hypothesis the responders were
all patients with lower levels of baseline brain amyloid
plaque load less than the 0.9 for the study, as these would
be the patients that would be expected to have higher
endogenous amyloid plaque clearance levels.
The reductions in brain amyloid plaque load were lar-
gely confined to the 40 mg dose group. The lesser of an
amyloid plaque load at the higher dose level of 125 mg
could be explained by the expected additional effect of
expected anti-inflammatory activity of neflamapimod at
the higher dose range that could, through reducing amy-
loid plaque clearance, offset the effect on amyloid plaque
production at the lower dose. The 125 mg twice daily
dose is equivalent in humans to the dose in aged rats that
reduced IL-1b levels in the hippocampus. In addition,
neflamapimod at 250 mg twice daily in patients with
rheumatoid arthritis demonstrated an anti-inflammatory
effect with reductions in serum C-reactive-protein and
IL-6 levels (Clinical Study Report VX00-745-102, EIP
Pharma on file).
The effect we found on episodic memory is in line
with a broad scientific literature that indicates that p38a
in involved in oligomeric amyloid-beta and inflammation-
induced synaptic dysfunction and to stress- and age-
related synaptic dysfunction in the hippocampus.4,5,10–14,31
In our clinical study, the ES that we saw for immediate
and delay recall compares favorably to ES of ≤0.2 for
WMS immediate or delayed recall at week 12 in the
placebo-treated subjects in two trials of Souvenaid in a
similar
patient
population
(mild
AD,
baseline
MMSE = 24).32,33 Although with the absence of a placebo
group our results could reflect practice effect, we think
this is unlikely since the learning effects on episodic
memory tests that are well recognized in cognitively intact
older individuals are less prominent, or absent, in biomar-
ker-positive early AD.34,35 The highly correlated relation-
ship between increasing plasma drug concentration of
neflamapimod with increasing improvement in immedi-
ate/delayed
also
suggests
that
there
is
a
true
drug
treatment effect.
Whether the effects of p38a kinase inhibition on synap-
tic dysfunction are related to the effects on amyloid beta
generation remains unknown. When neuronal p38a is
knocked out in the APP/PS1 mouse the effects on amy-
loid beta generation and synaptic function occur concur-
rently, suggesting the prevention of synaptic dysfunction
in that model is due to reducing amyloid beta genera-
tion.30 However, small molecule p38a also reverse spatial
learning and spatial working memory deficits in aged
rats16
and
in
an
inflammation-induced
tauopathy
model,17 respectively; neither of which demonstrate amy-
loid pathology. In this study, there were no correlations
between amyloid plaque reduction and improvement in
episodic memory function. However, brain amyloid pla-
que levels by PET scanning is not a measure of amyloid
beta generation, rather it is an integrated measure of both
amyloid plaque production and clearance. As a result,
there might be a consistent underlying effect on amyloid

not detected by PET scanning.
In summary, though the size of this study and the lack
of a placebo-controlled group limits the ability to draw
conclusions, our results suggest that selective p38a inhibi-
tion with neflamapimod may improve episodic memory
and in parallel may have the potential to impact amyloid
plaque production in AD. The results are consistent with
the scientific literature indicating increased neuronal p38a
activity leads to both synaptic dysfunction and increased
amyloid-beta generation through impairing autophagy-
mediated protein turnover. A 6-month placebo-controlled
study has recently been initiated to confirm these prelimi-
nary clinical findings, particularly with respect to the
effects on episodic memory function.
