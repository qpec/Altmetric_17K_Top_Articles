SUMMARY
The neural stem cell (NSC) reservoir can be har-
nessed for stem cell-based regenerative therapies.
Zebrafish remarkably regenerate
their
brain by
inducing NSC plasticity in a Amyloid-b-42 (Ab42)-
induced
experimental
Alzheimer’s
disease
(AD)
model. Interleukin-4 (IL-4) is also critical for AD-
induced NSC proliferation. However, the mecha-
nisms of this response have remained unknown.
Using single-cell transcriptomics in the adult zebra-
fish brain, we identify distinct subtypes of NSCs
and neurons and differentially regulated pathways
and their gene ontologies and investigate how cell-
cell communication is altered through ligand-recep-
tor pairs in AD conditions. Our results propose the
existence of heterogeneous and spatially organized
stem cell populations that react distinctly to amyloid
toxicity. This resource article provides an extensive
database for the molecular basis of NSC plasticity
in the AD model of the adult zebrafish brain. Further
analyses of stem cell heterogeneity and neuro-
regenerative ability at single-cell resolution could
yield drug targets for mobilizing NSCs for endoge-
nous neuro-regeneration in humans.
INTRODUCTION
Zebrafish, with their extensive regenerative ability, have become
a key model organism for studies of how tissues heal and regen-
erate (Alunni and Bally-Cuif, 2016; Kizil et al., 2012b; Zupanc,
2008). Although zebrafish provide valuable opportunities to
molecularly dissect the regenerative programs in many tissues,
there are still hurdles that render the interpretation of complex
cellular interactions and responses difficult, such as the hetero-
geneity of progenitor cell populations and their differential
response to stimuli (Ma
¨ rz et al., 2010).
Neural progenitor cells can have various identities in verte-
brates (Alvarez-Buylla et al., 2002). During development of the
nervous system, the neuroectoderm gives rise to neurons
through the earliest neural progenitors that have the neuroepi-
thelial character (Kla
¨ mbt, 2012; Pacary et al., 2012). Later, the
neuroepithelium gives rise to radial glial cells, which remain the
primary progenitor cell type in lower vertebrates such as zebra-
fish but are replaced by astrocytes in mammals (Goldman, 2012;
Go
¨ tz, 2012; Kriegstein and Alvarez-Buylla, 2009; Pollen et al.,
2015). These two glial cell types are also neurogenic. For
instance, in the subventricular zone of the mouse brain, the pri-
mary neurogenic progenitors are astrocytes (Doetsch, 2003;
Doetsch et al., 1999), whereas, in the zebrafish telencephalon,
the analogous region, the pallium, is populated by radial glial
cells, which are the neurogenic population (Adolf et al., 2006;
Grandel et al., 2006; Kizil et al., 2012b; Than-Trong and Bally-
Cuif, 2015; Zupanc, 2008). Therefore, investigation of the hetero-
geneity of stem cells in the adult zebrafish brain would provide an
important understanding of how progenitor subtypes react to
diseases, which molecular programs enable the plasticity of
stem cells, and whether those programs could be harnessed
for regenerative therapies in humans.
CNS regeneration in zebrafish is of particular importance
because of the robust neural regeneration ability in zebrafish
and potential clinical ramifications, which cannot be elucidated
with mammalian models. The zebrafish brain has a widespread
constitutive proliferative ability, and radial glial cells (RGCs)
constitute the major stem cell population. In the telencephalon,
for instance, RGCs form neurons throughout the life of the zebra-
fish, and they also respond to neuronal loss by reactively prolif-
erating. This proliferation requires induced molecular programs
that are required for the special regenerative ability of these
stem cells. Different insults have been shown to affect the
stem cell response differently, suggesting that distinct progeni-
tor cell populations might differentially react upon stimuli. For
instance, we generated an amyloid toxicity model in the adult
zebrafish brain and identified that zebrafish can effectively
enhance neural progenitor cell proliferation and neurogenesis
by inducing interleukin-4 (IL-4), which mediates the crosstalk

 between disease pathology in neurons to initiate the regenera-
tive output in stem cells (Bhattarai et al., 2016, 2017a, 2017b;
Kizil, 2018). We also found that IL-4 can directly affect human
neural stem cells in a similar fashion to induce proliferative and
neurogenic ability (Papadimitriou et al., 2018). However, in trau-
matic injuries, IL-4 is not induced in the zebrafish brain, although
stem cell proliferation increases in both situations. Therefore,
there is a need to define the relationship of stem cell heterogene-
ity and the regenerative plasticity response of those stem cells in
the zebrafish brain. This would provide a context-dependent
understanding of the molecular programs underlying the regen-
erative ability rather than a one-size-fits-all approach.
Because of the heterogeneity of stem cell populations and
neuronal subtypes in the zebrafish brain, it has not been possible
to clearly delineate cell-type-specific responses. This was also
the case for the Alzheimer’s disease model, where it remained
unknown how Amyloid-b-42 (Ab42) and IL-4 lead to enhanced
stem cell plasticity and neurogenesis, which individual subtypes
of stem cells and neurons respond to Ab42 and IL-4, and how
individual the responses were. Therefore, in our study, we
performed single-cell sequencing in control, Ab42-treated, and
IL-4-treated adult zebrafish telencephalon and categorized the
cell type identities and molecular programs of individual cell
types, how Ab42 and IL4 altered those programs, and how
different cell types interacted with each other. Our results add
further elaboration to our previous findings that Ab42 and IL-4
affect neural stem cells to enhance their neurogenic capacity
by providing detailed analyses of heterogeneous cell popula-
tions. We believe that the extensive datasets will not only provide
a useful resource for detailed examination of the adult zebrafish
brain and its remarkable regenerative ability in a homeostatic
and neurodegenerative context but also serve as an improvable
database for further research regarding the regenerative ability
of vertebrate brains.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Sequencing and Clustering of Cells to Identify Main Cell
Types
Previously, we have shown that Ab42 toxicity in zebrafish in-
duces the expression of IL-4 and that the IL-4-STAT6 pathway
induces neural stem- progenitor cell (NSPC) proliferation (Bhat-
tarai et al., 2016, 2017a, 2017b). We also found that IL-4 can
directly affect human neural stem cells in a similar fashion to
induce proliferative and neurogenic ability (Papadimitriou et al.,
2018). To investigate which cell types respond to Ab42 and
IL-4 in the adult zebrafish brain, we injected PBS, Ab42, and
IL-4 into a 6-month-old adult zebrafish brain as described previ-
ously (Bhattarai et al., 2016) and designed an analysis pipeline
(Figure 1A). We dissected the telencephalon region of the adult
brain of a transgenic zebrafish that expressed GFP under the
her4.1 promoter, which marks glial cells (Yeo et al., 2007). Using
flow cytometry-assisted cell sorting, we removed cell debris and
dead cells (Figures S1A–S1C) and enriched the GFP+ and GFP�
cells. To perform single-cell sequencing, we mixed viable GFP+
and GFP� cells in a 1:1 ratio. After single-cell sequencing, we
mapped the resulting reads to the zebrafish genome and per-
formed unbiased clustering (Figures 1B–1D) using Seurat soft-
ware (Butler et al., 2018). After removing cells with minimum
and maximum thresholds for nUMI, nGene, and mitochondrial
RNA genes, we obtained 609, 737, and 450 cells from PBS-,
Ab42-, and IL-4-treated fish telencephalons, respectively. The
read numbers per cell (nUMI), number of genes detected per
cell, and mitochondrial mRNA percentages (Figures S1D–S1I)
were comparable with previously published datasets (Farrell
et al., 2018; Pandey et al., 2018; Raj et al., 2018; Satija et al.,
2015), supporting the quality of our datasets. Furthermore, by
comparing nUMI, nGene, percent.gfp (percentage of gfp tran-
scripts), and percent.mito (percentage of mitochondrial genes),
our datasets were comparable with each other (Figures S1D–
S1I). By using the Seurat feature of integrating data analyses
from different conditions, we classified our cell types for all sam-
ples together (Figures 1B and 1C; Figures S1J and S1K). By inte-
grating and combining all cells, we were able to classify cell
types that have fewer cells in one sample; otherwise, these cell
types are classified with the closest cell types based on the var-
iable genes (data not shown). By using some marker genes (e.g.,
lcp1, pfn1, her4.1, s100b, id1, sv2a, nrgna, olig1, and olig2; Fig-
ure S1L), we identified 4 major cell clusters as Im (immune) cells,
PCs (progenitor cells), NNs (neurons), and OPCs/ODs (oligoden-
drocyte progenitor cells and oligodendrocytes). Then, we identi-
fied the top 10 markers for each of these 4 clusters (OPCs/ODs
not combined, kept as OPC/OD_1 and OPC/OD_2) (Figure 1D)
and top 10 marker genes (Figure 1E; Data S1).
Given that Ab42 and IL-4 have effects on gene expression, we
asked whether combining all cells from different conditions
would affect cell clustering. Because Seurat can be used to clus-
ter cells from different treatments, technologies, or species (But-
ler et al., 2018), we observed a clear separation of marker genes
in two main cell clusters: NNs and PCs. Interestingly, the top 10
marker genes in NNs are almost completely absent in PCs and
vice versa (Figure 1E). Moreover, the majority of neuronal
markers are absent in immune cells, suggesting that cluster-
based cell separation is successful.
The PCs express some commonly known marker genes such
as fabp7a, her4.1, her4.2, and id1 (Figure 1E). Interestingly,
fabp7a is found in all PCs, and her4.1 is not expressed by all
PCs, possibly sparing non-glial progenitors such as the neuroe-
pithelium (Figure S1L). Of note, as expected, GFP is expressed in
almost all her4.1 cells at higher levels (Figure 2C; Figure S2K).
Cell Clustering and Identification of Cell Types for PCs
and NNs
After several rounds of analyses, we realized that variable genes
in NNs and PCs limit the clear separation of cells. Thus, while
finding the top marker genes for PCs by comparing genes from
one cell cluster with all other cell clusters (Ims, OPCs, and
NNs), we found that marker genes cannot be clearly separated
or that one marker genes are shared with 2 or more other PCs.
To find subtypes of PCs, we ran clustering using only PCs iden-
tified in Figure 1 and using the same analysis steps described
above, except for using the ‘‘num.dims’’ value (an indicator of
the number of dimensions used for the principal-component an-
alyses) as 20 to increase the stringency for aligning and finding
the iterative clusters (Figure 2A; Figures S2A-S2C and S2H).
With the same strategy, we further sub-clustered the NNs as
1308
Cell Reports 27, 1307–1318, April 23, 2019
 well (Figures S2D-S2F and S2I). We then color-coded cell clus-
ters for PCs and NNs (Figures S2C and S2F) and showed the
cells on a t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE)
plot (Figure 1A) using the new color-coded cells (Figure S2G).
With this strategy, we observed better marker enrichment in
the PC and NN types through iterative sub-clustering (Figures
S2J and S2K; https://www.kizillab.org/singlecell).
Interestingly, after sub-clustering the PCs and neuronal cells,
some cell clusters that are mixed by using all cells are clearly
separated by iterative sub-clustering. For instance, cell clusters 1
and 4 in Figure 1C can be clustered into 4 neuronal clusters
(NN_0, NN_1, NN_4, and NN_7; Figures S2F and S2G). Addition-
ally, by using all cells, we could identify PC 0, PC 1, PC 2, and
PC 4 cells and clearly separate them in tSNE plots (Figure 2A;
Figure S2C). Therefore, we propose that iterative sub-clustering
of PCs is an efficient way to demonstrate the heterogeneity of
similar cell types.
In the current study, we focused mainly on PCs and the effect
of Ab42 and IL-4 on those cells; however, wherever required, we
provide results from all cell types as well (https://www.kizillab.
org/singlecell). After the two-step clustering, we identified 1, 2,
8, and 9 cell clusters for Im cells, OPCs/ODs, NNs, and PCs,
respectively (Figure S2G) and focused mainly on PCs. After iden-
tifying PC clusters, we aimed to validate our results with
biological in situ data to predict the regionalization and type of
PCs. Therefore, we took the advantage of an unbiased and

cephalon of Adult Zebrafish (AGETAZ) (https://itgmv3.itg.kit.

We tested the validity and reliability of our tSNE feature plots
by comparing her4.1 and GFP plots with GFP expression in the
her4.1-GFP transgenic zebrafish line (Figure 2B) and observed
that, indeed, GFP is a general indicator of PC populations (Figure
2C). Later, we selected several regional markers from the in situ
hybridization database and checked their localizations on
feature plots (Figure 2D; Figure S3). As a result, we identified
deterministic marker expression for all PC clusters (Figure 2D).

 For instance, PC 5 cells express pcna, mki67, top2a, and ascl1a,
indicating that these cells are actively proliferating cells or neuro-
blasts. PC 3 cells are the closest cells to PC 5 cells by expressing
pcna and ascl1a but not mki67 and top2a and can be classified
as non-proliferating neuroblast precursors or pre-neuroblasts
(Figure 2D; Figures S2J). Pre-neuroblasts and neuroblasts share
common top marker genes (Figure S2J). Neuroblasts express
known markers associated with the neuroblast state (such as
pcna, stmn1a, and hmgb2) at higher levels compared with pre-
neuroblasts. These two cell types do not show a regional locali-
zation but are scattered along the ventricular region in the adult
zebrafish telencephalon (Figure 2D).
PC 6 cells do not express s100b and her4.1, whereas PC 8
cells express her4.1 but not s100b. These two cells are not radial
glial cells but, combined with the expression of other markers
(e.g., zic1, krt8, and clu; Figure 2D; Figure S3) can be classified
as neuroepithelium cells. These cells are mainly localized in the
ventral (Vv) telencephalon (based on zic1 and iqgap2 expression;
Figure 2D). Even though these clusters localize similarly to the
ventral telencephalon, they represent two distinct populations.
PC 0 contains cells that express markers of the dorsal (Dd) and
dorsomedial (Dm) part of the telencephalon (Figure 2; pou3f1 and
dmrta2). Although PC 2 cells express dmrta2 and nr2f1b (Dd
markers; Figure 2D), PC 4 cells express gsx2 and pou3f1, which
are expressed more in the Dm region (Figure 2D). Interestingly,
PC 0 shares common markers either with PC 2 or PC 4. Based
on the presence and expression of these marker genes, we clas-
sify PC 2 as Dd, PC 4 as Dm and PC 0 as both Dd and Dm. These
findings indicate that different regions contain heterogeneous PC
populations that differ by marker gene expression.
PC 1 expresses nr2f1b and pou3f1 and, based on the in situ
hybridization results of these genes, mainly localize on the lateral
part of the telencephalon (dorsolateral [Dl]). PC 7 marks an inter-
esting cell type that is characterized by foxj1a expression, which
is clearly localized to the interstitial region between the ventral
and Dm telencephalon (Figures 2D and 2E), and is classified as
cells at the ventral part of the dorsal telencephalon (Vd). foxj1a
is a central regulator of motile ciliogenesis and is co-expressed
in PC 7 with rsph9, cfap126, and enkur, which are motile ciliated
cell markers (Figure S3) (Lindsey et al., 2012; Ogino et al., 2016).
Based on our findings, we propose that PC 7 corresponds to
ependymal cells of the adult zebrafish telencephalon. Because
ciliated cells are crucial for the development and function of
the CNS (Olstad et al., 2019; Sternberg et al., 2018), and because
the neurogenic nature of ependymal cells is controversial (Jo-
hansson et al., 1999; Spassky et al., 2005), our results provide
important molecular information in a normal and Alzheimer’s-
like state and could contribute to more sophisticated elaboration
of the neurogenic capacity and physiological functions of epen-
dymal cells.
Overall, marker genes, in situ expression, and differential clus-
tering reveal that the ventricular region of adult zebrafish telen-
cephalon contains distinct progenitor subtypes that can be
spatially defined (Figure 2E).
By using iterative sub-clustering of PCs, we identified 7 pro-
genitor and 2 neuroblast types in the telencephalon. To identify
how these cell types are related to each other, we constructed
a pseudotime using Monocle software (Qiu et al., 2017; Fig-
ure 2F). We found that PCs perfectly progressed from progenitor
states toward proliferative states (Figure 2F). PC 0, 1, 2, and 4 are
distributed on pseudotime but not in a specific location. This
indicates that progenitors have a physiological continuum from
non-dividing
(or
quiescent)
to
potentially
dividing
states.
Pseudotime also predicts the formation of pre-neuroblasts and
neuroblasts from other PCs, and, interestingly, regardless from
which progenitor state they come, neuroblasts are rather homo-
geneous cell types in terms of marker gene expression. Based
on this observation, we propose that, by using pseudotime, we
could also capture the state of PCs and that neurogenic hetero-
geneity exists at the PC stage rather than at the neuroblast stage.
We propose that the adult zebrafish brain contains committed
and regionally specified neural progenitors that generate neuro-
genic diversity through a rather homogeneous neuroblast stage
(all gene expression data, gene ontology (GO) term analyses,
and tSNE plots for every cell cluster in control, amyloid-treated,
and IL-4-treated brains can be found at https://www.kizillab.org/
singlecell).
Plasticity Is Affected in a Subset of PCs after Ab42 and
IL-4
Based on the spatially confined PC populations that display
distinct marker gene expression, we hypothesized that some
of these PC populations would react differentially to amyloid
toxicity or IL-4 treatment. A central feature of neural progenitors
is their plasticity, which would reflect in a proliferative response.
To determine the cell types amyloid and IL-4 affect, we injected
amyloid or IL-4 into adult zebrafish brains and analyzed cell
proliferation in predefined regions: Dl, Dd, Dm, Vd, and Vv telen-
cephalon (Figure 3A) by performing immunohistochemical stain-
ing for proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and GFP on the
her4.1:GFP transgenic reporter line (Figures 3B–3D’). We
observed that amyloid and IL-4 increased cell proliferation in 3
of the 5 regions: the Dd, Dm, and Vd telencephalon (Figure 3E).
These results suggest that PC populations react differentially to
amyloid toxicity and that heterogeneity of the progenitors under-
lies neurogenic ability. Because the zebrafish brain can increase
neurogenic output after various insults through activation of
different molecular mechanisms (Alunni and Bally-Cuif, 2016;
Bhattarai et al., 2016; Cosacak et al., 2015; Diotel et al., 2013;
Kizil, 2018; Kizil et al., 2012a, 2012b, 2012c; Kyritsis et al.,
2012; Ma
¨ rz et al., 2011; Shimizu et al., 2018; Tincer et al.,
2016), understanding the subpopulation of PCs that are respon-
sible for the regenerative ability after particular injuries would
have tremendous clinical ramifications. More focused investiga-
tions of these special cells could shed light on which programs
must be induced in comparative cell types in human brains to
boost neurogenic output.
Amyloid Toxicity Changes the Molecular Regulatory
Landscape of PCs
Because amyloid toxicity affects PC plasticity in a spatially
specific manner, we aimed to determine the molecular changes
pertaining to this response using our single-cell analyses. There-
fore, we determined differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in
every cluster (Data S2) and subsequently identified differentially
regulated Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG)

1311
 pathways in PCs that are located at the Dd, Dm, and Vd telen-
cephalon (PC 0, 2, 3, 4, and 5; Figures 4A and 4B; Data S3).
By comparing the DEGs in every cell cluster within individual
treatments (i.e., Ab42 and IL-4), we found that every cell type
has a unique set of DEGs because the percent overlap of
DEGs after Ab42 or IL-4 treatment in a particular cell type is
below 30% (percentage of the number of common DEGs in clus-
ters X and Y divided by the number of DEGs in cluster X; Data
S4A and S4B). However, when we compared the percent over-
lap of DEGs that are determined in a given cell type after Ab42
and IL-4 treatment, we found that, in several cell types, Ab42
and IL-4 lead to differential expression of more than 30% of
the genes in a similar fashion (e.g., PC 0 cells, PC 4 cells, and
Im cells; Data S4C). These results suggest that every cell type

 has a unique molecular signature that is synergistically affected
by Ab42 and IL-4.
With GO term analyses, we also observed that every cell
cluster changed distinct molecular pathways after amyloid
toxicity, with a few categories overlapping between cell
clusters (e.g., oxidative phosphorylation). For instance, cell
cycle-related pathways are affected by amyloid only in PC 5
(neuroblasts with proliferative ability), which supports our clas-
sification and suggests that, by investigating the differentially
regulated pathways, we could determine the signaling land-
scape that is responsible for induced plasticity in particular
cell types after amyloid toxicity. An example could be seen in
PC 2, where the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
signaling pathway is uniquely affected (Figure 4B). Therefore,
our single-cell data could be used to determine the signaling
pathways that are specifically involved in regulation of neuro-
genic plasticity of particular PCs.
A prominent way in which cells interact with each other is
through secreted molecules and their receptors in target cells.
To determine such putative cell-cell communication through
secreted molecules, we determined (bioinformatically and based
on the literature) 646 ligands interacting with 658 receptors
(Data S5). Among the marker genes expressed in clusters
(Data S5), we found that 101 ligands and 117 receptors were
expressed in identified clusters (Data S5). We generated several
interaction maps based on identified genes (https://www.
kizillab.org/singlecell; Data S5), portraying complex interaction
between cell types.
Because the interaction data we obtained represent a poten-
tial interaction landscape based only on ligand-receptor pair
interaction, it needed validation. Therefore, we determined the
interaction
of
individual
signaling
pathways
(https://www.
kizillab.org/singlecell). Many major signaling pathways, such as
fibroblast growth factor (Fgf), Integrin, chemokine, and Notch
signaling, are known to be involved in cell-cell communication
in the adult zebrafish brain (Alunni et al., 2013; Cacialli et al.,
2016; Diotel et al., 2010; Jiao et al., 2011; Kaslin et al., 2009; Kizil
et al., 2012a, 2012c; Shimizu et al., 2018). To depict how cell
clusters interact using these pathways, we plotted the intercom-
munication predictions for cell types expressing the receptor or
ligand for pathways (Figure 4C). We found that all interaction cat-
egories are complex and involve the participation of many cell
types, which includes NN-PC and Im-PC interaction. Despite
this complexity, such data mining could provide valuable and
unprecedented biological information. We also identified other
potential interactions with less studied ligands and receptors,
such as agrn, appa, ctgfa, gnai2, penkb, ptn, serpine, edil3a,
and hbegf (https://www.kizillab.org/singlecell), which might pro-
vide still unknown candidates for regulation of NSPC plasticity.
To provide biological verification of our interaction analyses,
we selected the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling pathway,
which is involved in NCS/PC proliferation in the zebrafish brain

 (Ganz et al., 2010; Kaslin et al., 2009; Kizil and Brand, 2011; Slept-
sova-Friedrich et al., 2001; Topp et al., 2008), and investigated
whether it would affect the proliferative ability of the brain regions
that correspond to the cell clusters found to be affected by FGF in
our interaction analyses (Figure 4C).
We performed tSNE plot analyses for all receptors for FGF
(data not shown) and found that fgfr3 is specifically expressed
in PCs (Figure 5A). We then constructed an interaction map by
determining the potential interactions through Fgfr3 (Figure 5B).
With such a sub-interaction map, all possible communications
through fgfr3 and its ligands are sketched, and we hypothesized
that Fgfr3 signaling would positively affect mainly PC 2 (Dd) and
PC 5 (neuroblasts) (Figure 5C). Amyloid treatment seemed to
cause interactions that were not present in control brains from
various cell types toward PC 2 and PC 5 (Figures 5B and 5C).
If the interaction map analyses were reliably predictive, then
this would suggest that, after activation of Fgfr3 signaling upon
Ab42, the Dd and Dm regions of the zebrafish brain could change
their proliferative response. To test this hypothesis, we injected
the Fgfr3 ligand FGF8 (Chellaiah et al., 1999; Sleptsova-Friedrich
et al., 2001) into the adult zebrafish brain and determined the
changes in cell proliferation (Figure 5D) by performing immuno-
histochemical staining for PCNA (Figures 5E–5F’). We found
that, compared with control brains, FGF8 injection significantly
increased cell proliferation in the Dd and Dm regions, exactly
as predicted by the interaction mapping (Figures 5G and 5H).
Overall, our interaction studies provide an extensive high-resolu-
tion cell-cell communication map, and these predictions pro-
vides a further level of elucidation for the heterogeneity of neural
stem cell populations and the molecular mechanisms controlling
the plasticity response thereof.
Further investigation of our data and experimental validation of
the candidates presented in our resource platform would provide
the molecular programs underlying the neural stem cell (NSC)
plasticity and regenerative response of the adult zebrafish brain
in Alzheimer’s disease conditions as well as the downstream
regulation of IL-4. Given that we have recently shown that IL-4
is sufficient to enhance the human NSC plasticity and regenera-
tive capacity in a 3D human Alzheimer’s model and to circum-
vent the AD pathology (Papadimitriou et al., 2018), our data will
undoubtedly provide more candidates that can be clinically
relevant. Such an understanding would provide new therapeutic
targets for Alzheimer’s disease for clinical and pharmaceutical
use, not only for neurogenesis but also for neuronal survival
and synaptic integrity, as exemplified recently (Reinhardt et al.,
2019).
Conclusion
Heterogeneity of NSC activity and fate decisions mainly rely on
activation or suppression of distinct molecular programs in
respective cell types. Single-cell sequencing uniquely allows
investigation of individual cell types and their response to stimuli.
In our analyses, we identified distinct cell types of the adult
zebrafish telencephalon, which is a widely used experimental

 model for studying neuronal regeneration and NSC plasticity. By
focusing on stem cell populations, we also identified how Ab42,
the hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease, affects these cell types and
which genes and pathways are altered upon Ab42 toxicity.
Because the zebrafish brain can enhance its stem cell activity
and neurogenesis in Alzheimer’s disease conditions, under-
standing in more detail how Ab42 affects individual cells would
certainly enhance our understanding of how a vertebrate brain
could counteract Alzheimer’s pathology and propose previously
unidentified targets for clinical use or drug development.
In mammals, radial glial cells give rise to astrocytes during the
second wave of neurogenesis (Hansen et al., 2010; Kriegstein
and Alvarez-Buylla, 2009; Urba
´ n and Guillemot, 2014). In fish,
however, radial glia remain as such morphologically, and, by
definition, there is no astrocyte in the telencephalon (Adolf
et al., 2006; Ganz et al., 2012; Grandel et al., 2006; Ma
¨ rz et al.,
2010; Mueller et al., 2004). In our study, the PC populations
were almost entirely positive for S100beta, a canonical marker
for astrocytes in mammals (Doetsch et al., 1999). Therefore,
we believe that marker-based interpretation of a cell type in
evolutionary terms cannot be performed and that, in zebrafish,
radial glial cells take over astrocytic functions. Additionally, in
our tSNE analyses, no progenitor cluster generated a branch
that could be considered astrocytes. Therefore, we believe
that there are no astrocytes in the telencephalon, which supports
previous studies (Barbosa et al., 2015; Grupp et al., 2010; Kaslin
et al., 2008; Kizil et al., 2012b; Lam et al., 2009; Mueller and Wul-
limann, 2009; Rothenaigner et al., 2011; Than-Trong and Bally-
Cuif, 2015). In mice, astrocytes also co-segregate with NSCs in
single-cell analyses (Artegiani et al., 2017), suggesting that,
even in species where astrocytes are evident, without specific
sorting for these cells, they cannot be distinguished from existing
cell types.
Our analyses subdivided the her4.1-positive PC population,
which had previously been considered a uniform cell type: radial
glia (Kroehne et al., 2011; Ma
¨ rz et al., 2010; Than-Trong and
Bally-Cuif, 2015; Yeo et al., 2007). We identified 9 sub-clusters,
2 of which are ventral neuroepithelial cell types that are not radial
glia, which supports previous findings (Kaslin et al., 2008).
Another two clusters are neuroblasts, which separate according
to their proliferative status. Pre-neuroblasts express almost
identical markers as proliferating neuroblasts but also share
common markers with the remaining five sub-clusters of progen-
itors, from which they emanate. Whether PCs are lineage-
restricted or multipotent has been an intriguing question
(Alvarez-Buylla et al., 2002; Laywell et al., 2000; Raj et al.,
2018; Temple, 2001). Studies in salamanders have proposed
that regenerative masses of progenitors are strictly lineage-
restricted and remember their original identities (Antos and
Tanaka, 2010; Kragl et al., 2009), whereas, in mammals, where
neurogenic competency and potency of the neural progenitors
decline with age, progenitors are lineage-restricted in adult
stages and multipotent in embryonic development (Costa
et al., 2010; Go
¨ tz, 2012, 2015). Our study in zebrafish suggests
that neuroblasts—cells that are proliferative and leading to
actual neurogenesis—cluster into a single population. We there-
fore propose that the mode of neurogenesis and lineage compe-
tency of the zebrafish brain involves transition from a single,
rather homogeneous cell population (neuroblasts) with common
molecular landmarks and represents the embryonic mode of
neurogenesis in mammals. This also suggests that zebrafish
can be used as a viable comparative tool for mammalian brains
to understand the molecular programs that would mimic the
early embryonic stages of neurogenesis in adult stages.
Because one of the aims in regenerative therapies is to rejuve-
nate the adult mammalian brain and to impose regenerative
ability back to it (Gage et al., 2016; Katsimpardi et al., 2014;
Wyss-Coray, 2016), the adult zebrafish brain would serve as an
excellent model, with its endogenous life-long neurogenic com-
petency and regenerative ability.
Our results provide complex and multi-layered information
that can be retrieved from our accompanying website (http://
www.kizillab.org/singlecell). First, it provides refinement of the
cell types and progenitor states in the adult zebrafish telenceph-
alon. This will allow investigation of certain regions or cell types
at a higher resolution and can allow cell-specific investigation
of biological phenomena. Our analyses of the pathways that
are active in certain clusters in homeostatic states of the fish
brain also provide candidate signaling pathways that can be
investigated in detail. Parallels between our results and previous
literature as well as our validation studies confirm the fidelity of
our analyses and interpretations. In addition to known signaling
molecules, our data provide extensive resources for identifica-
tion of new molecules and cellular interactions in the adult fish
brain. Additionally, our analyses with Ab42 and IL-4 treatment
provide unprecedented information regarding the stem cell plas-
ticity and regenerative output of the fish brain in Alzheimer’s
conditions.

 Animals
Transgenic zebrafish expressing GFP under the her4.1 promoter (Tg(her4.1:GFP, Yeo et al., 2007) was used for sorting progenitors
and the rest of the telencephalon. 6 months post fertilization (mpf) female fish were used for analyses.
METHOD DETAILS
Cerebroventricular microinjection
Tg(her4.1:GFP) zebrafish were injected through a slit generated over the optic tectum using a barbed end 30-gauge needle (Bhattarai
et al., 2016; Kizil and Brand, 2011; Kizil et al., 2013). Glass capillary filled with injection liquid was inserted into the cerebrospinal
space of the adult brain and 1 ml of the solution was injected. Fish were injected with either with PBS (control), Ab42 (20 mM) or Inter-
leukin-4 (1 mM), and were kept at 14 hr light/10 hr dark cycle in normal water system for 24 hours. FGF8 was injected at 0.2 mg/ml final
concentration. Experimental fish were sacrificed using 0.2% MESAB according to the animal experimentation permits.
Cell Dissociation and sorting
The telencephalon of the fish were dissected in ice-cold PBS and directly dissociated with Neural Tissue Dissociation Kit (Miltenyi) at
28.5�C as described previously (Bhattarai et al., 2016). After dissociation, cells were filtered through 40 mM cell strainer into 10 mL 2%
BSA in PBS, centrifuged at 300 g for 10 min and cells resuspended in 4% BSA in PBS. Viability indicator (Propidium iodide) and GFP
were used to sort viable GFP(+) or GFP(-) cells by FACS. The resulting single cell suspension was promptly loaded on the
10X Chromium system (Zheng et al., 2016). 10X libraries were prepared as per the manufacturer’s instructions. The raw sequencing
data was processed by the cell ranger software provided by the 10X genomics with the default options. The reads were
aligned to zebrafish reference transcriptome (ENSEMBL Zv10, release 91) and eGFP CDS (with arbitrary ensemble ID;
ENSDARG99999999999). The resulting matrices were used as input for downstream data analysis by Seurat (Butler et al., 2018).
Droplet encapsulation sequencing
To prepare the cells for droplet-based sequencing, 2700 GFP-positive and 2700 GFP-negative cells were flow-sorted into a coated
tubes containing 2 ml saline solution with 0.04 % Bovine serum albumin (BSA). Subsequently, the single cell suspension was carefully
mixed with reverse transcription mix before loading the cells on the 10X Genomics Chromium system. During the encapsulation, the
cells were lysed within the droplet and they released polyadenylated RNA bound to the barcoded bead, which was encapsulated with
the cell. Following the guidelines of the 10x Genomics user manual, the droplets were directly subjected to reverse transcription, the
emulsion was broken and cDNA was purified using Silane beads. After the amplification of cDNA with 10 cycles, purification and
quantification was performed.
The 10X Genomics single cell RNA-sequencing library preparation - involving fragmentation, dA-tailing, adapter ligation, and
12-cycle indexing PCR – was performed. After quantification, the libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 550 machine us-
ing a HighOutput flowcell in paired-end mode (R1: 26 cycles; I1: 8 cycles; R2: 57 cycles), thus generating 80-125 million fragments.
The raw sequencing data was then processed with the ‘count’ command of the Cell Ranger software provided by 10X Genomics. The
option of ‘–expect-cells’ was set to 2700 (all other options were used as per default). To build the reference for Cell Ranger, zebrafish
genome (GRCz10) as well as gene annotation (Ensembl 91) were downloaded from Ensembl and the annotation was filtered with the
‘mkgtf’ command of Cell Ranger (options: ‘–attribute=gene_biotype:protein_coding –attribute=gene_biotype:lincRNA –attribute=
gene_biotype:antisense’). Genome sequence and filtered annotation were then used as input to the ‘mkref’ command of Cell Ranger
to build the appropriate CellRanger Reference.
Data Analysis by Seurat
All matrices were read by Read10X function; cell names were re-named as sample names and the column number, to trace back cells
if required. First, we removed all ribosomal RNA genes, then we filtered out cells as following; cell with more than 15000 UMI or less
than 1000 UMI, cells with less than 500 or more than 2500 unique genes, cells with more than 6% mitochondrial genes. The genes
found in less than 5 cells were filtered out. Moreover, we removed cells with potential of mulitplet. The remaining cells and genes were
used for downstream analysis for all samples. The data normalized by using ‘‘LogNormalize’’ method, data scaled with ‘‘scale.factor =
1e4.’’ For each datasets variable genes found with FindVariableGenes with the following options mean.function = ExpMean, disper-
sion.function = LogVMR, x.low.cutoff = 0.125, x.high.cutoff = 10, y.cutoff = 0.5. The top1000 most highly variable genes from each
sample were merged, mitochondrial genes were removed. Then, the intersection of these genes with all genes in each samples were
used for CCA analysis. The 3 Seurat objects and the variable genes found above were used to generate a new Seurat object with
RunMultiCCA function, using num.ccs = 30. The canonical correlation strength were calculated using num.dims = 1:30 and the
samples were aligned using dims.align = 1:10. The cell clusters were found using aligned CCA and 1:10 dims, with higher resolution
1.0. The cell clusters were shown on 2D using t-SNE (RunTSNE function). By using some general markers, we found 4
major cell types; Progenitor Cells (PCs) [fabp7a+], Immune cells (Im) [lcp1+, pfn1+], Oligodenrocytes / Progenitor Cells (OPC/OD_1,
OPC/OD_2), and Neuron (sv2a+, synpr+). The marker genes for these 5 cell poplations were calculated by using
FindAllMarkers function with options min.pct = 0.25, thresh.use = 0.25. The Progenitor cells or Neurons were separated from all other
e2
Cell Reports 27, 1307–1318.e1–e3, April 23, 2019
 cells and PCs or Neuronal cell clusters were identified using aforementioned steps with some changes; instead of num.dims = 10,
num.dims = 20 were used. The marker genes for PCs or Neuronal cell types were identified as above.
Monocle analysis of progenitor cells
In order to identify cell trajectories on pseudotime, we converte the Progentor cells Seurat object to Monocle (Qiu et al., 2017). The
estimated size factor set to 1.0 as the data were already normalized by Seurat. We used the genes used for CCA analysis for ordering
in monocle, with max_components = 4. The cells were colored as the colors on Seurat TSNE plots.
Identification of cell types
Feature plots were generated by Seurat software and cell types were determined by the expression of marker genes that define
specific cell types.
GO-term analyses
We used the all marker genes with False Detection Rate < 0.1 for Gene Ontology analysis and KEGG pathway analysis using GOStats
(1.7.4) (Falcon and Gentleman, 2007) and GSEABase (1.40.1), p value < 0.05 as threshold as described previously (Papadimitriou
et al., 2018). To determine the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) after Ab42 and IL4 treatment, we used FindMarkers function
using cell cluster that have at least 3 cells from all samples. Then, we used the p value < 0.05 for significantly expressed genes. These
genes were used for GO and pathway analysis using the scripts that are available on www.kizillab.org/resources.
Construction of interaction maps
For the ligand-receptor interaction, we downloaded all Ligand and receptors from a previous publication (Ramilowski et al., 2015)
(http://fantom.gsc.riken.jp/5/suppl/Ramilowski_et_al_2015/vis/#/hive), and orthologs for zebrafish were found using BiomaRt of
ENSEMBL. The ligand-receptor for zebrafish were used for downstream analysis as following; for cell-cell interaction, all ligands
found in 20% of a cell types were chosen, then their receptors were identified in all cell types. If a ligand-receptor pathway was found,
then we draw a direction from the cell with the ligand to the cells with the receptor. We used igraph in R to draw interaction map as
previously described (Skelly et al., 2018). In order to show the lost and/or new interaction after treatment, we calculated all the
interaction for PBS and the treatment (Ab42 or IL4) and then generated an interaction maps from all interaction of PBS and the
treatment. Then, we colored the edges as cyan (lost after treatment), purple (induced after treatment) and black that are not affected
by the treatment; but may be differentially expressed.
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSES
Images from histological sections were acquired using Zeiss ZEN software in Zeiss Apotome, Leica SP5 confocal microscope or
using AxioScanner slide scanner. Counting was performed on acquired images in a double-blinded manner. The statistical analyses
were performed using GraphPad Prism and two-tailed Student’s t tests. The levels of significance were *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, and
***p < 0.001. In all graphs, means ± standard errors of the means were shown. The data conforms to normal distribution as deter-
mined by Pearson’s chi-square test.
