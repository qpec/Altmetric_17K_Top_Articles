Evidence for Domains of Hearing Loss,
as Reported by Adults With Hearing Loss
and Their Communication Partners

Abstract
A number of assessment tools exist to evaluate the impact of hearing loss, with little consensus among researchers as to
either preference or psychometric adequacy. The item content of hearing loss assessment tools should seek to capture the
impact of hearing loss on everyday life, but to date no one has synthesized the range of hearing loss complaints from the
perspectives of the person with hearing loss and their communication partner. The current review aims to synthesize the
evidence on person with hearing loss- and communication partner-reported complaints of hearing loss. Searches were
conducted in Cos Conference Papers Index, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Excerpta
Medica Database, PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar to identify publications from May 1982 to August 2015.
A manual search of four relevant journals updated the search to May 2017. Of the 9,516 titles identified, 78 records
(comprising 20,306 participants) met inclusion criteria and were taken through to data collection. Data were analyzed
using meta-ethnography to form domains representing the person with hearing loss- and communication partner-reported
complaints of hearing loss as reported in research. Domains and subdomains mutual to both perspectives are related to
‘‘Auditory’’ (listening, communicating, and speaking), ‘‘Social’’ (relationships, isolation, social life, occupational, and interven-
tions), and ‘‘Self’’ (effort and fatigue, emotions, identity, and stigma). Our framework contributes fundamental new know-
ledge and a unique resource that enables researchers and clinicians to consider the broader impacts of hearing loss. Our
findings can also be used to guide questions during diagnostic assessment and to evaluate existing measures of hearing loss.

Introduction
Hearing loss affects about 300 million adults worldwide
(World Health Organization, 2015), and there is general
consensus that hearing loss can have a negative impact
on various aspects of an individual’s quality of life.
Difficulties in everyday life attributed to hearing loss
vary considerably from person to person, and the
degree of difficulties correlates poorly with audiometric
profiles (Gatehouse & Noble, 2004). Aspects of life
affected by hearing loss in relation to hearing aid
uptake, such as personality, cannot be measured using
performance-based technical measures (Cox, 2003), and
other effects that individuals with hearing loss may
experience are in activity limitations or participation
restrictions (Helvik et al., 2006), which too cannot be
measured
directly
in
the
clinic.

 recommended as the most appropriate measure for
capturing a representative account of hearing-related
complaints (Macefield et al., 2014). The diversity of
generic and hearing-specific complaints such as hearing
disability, hearing handicap, quality of life, hearing aid
benefit, communication, and psychological outcomes
perhaps helps to explain why so many questionnaires
have been developed to explore the impact of hearing
loss. One survey found 140 questionnaires, with about
one third of all their collated items being concerned with
the person’s own hearing, another third with the impact
of it, and a quarter with hearing aids (Akeroyd, Wright-
Whyte, Holman, & Whitmer, 2015; Whitmer, Wright-
Whyte, Holman, & Akeroyd, 2016). A systematic
review of audiological research (Granberg, Dahlstrom,
Moller, Kahari, & Danermark, 2014) identified 39 differ-
ent standardized patient-reported measures in use. The
Hearing Handicap Inventory for the Elderly (HHIE;
Ventry & Weinstein, 1982) was the most common ques-
tionnaire but was used just seven times out of a total of
122 articles, and the Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid
Benefit (Cox & Alexander, 1995) was the second most
common, being used just four times. The frequency of
usage
of
individual
instruments
is
therefore
low.
This pattern of ‘‘many questionnaires in use, yet little
consensus’’ (Granberg, Dahlstrom, et al., 2014) has
been confirmed more recently by a scoping review
(Barker, MacKenzie, Elliott, & de Lusignan, 2015).
Some researchers have developed hearing loss assessment
questionnaires that tap into specific domains, such as the
social and emotional consequences of hearing loss that
are in the HHIE. Other researchers have opted to
develop questionnaires that allow for the person with
hearing impairment (PHI) to indicate important aspects
of their life affected by hearing loss, such as the Glasgow
Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit (Gatehouse, 1999).
Perhaps the most promising comprehensive project
here comes from the International Classification of
Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF); see details
below. This issue is also represented by the vast
number of studies that have investigated the negative
consequences of hearing loss that span beyond auditory
impairment
(Arlinger,
2003;
Barker,
Leighton,
&
Ferguson, 2017).
It is also desirable that the items in questionnaires are
fully determined by patient input, yet how items in many
published questionnaires were selected is not always
reported clearly in terms of either stakeholder input (pro-
fessionals, patients or both) or methods used to collect
potential content information. However, without this
knowledge, we cannot be sure that examining question-
naire items or subscales in isolation will give the full
range of patient-reported domains relating to the every-
day impact of hearing loss. For example, of the nine
questionnaires developed to measure the impact of
hearing loss on day-to-day life, only five explicitly
involved patient involvement using qualitative methods,
namely the Communication Profile for the Hearing
Impaired (Demorest & Erdman, 1987), Performance
Inventory for Profound and Severe Loss (Owens &
Raggio, 1988), Satisfaction with Amplification in Daily
Life (Cox & Alexander, 1999), the Speech, Spatial
and Qualities of Hearing Scale (Gatehouse & Noble,
2004), and the International Outcome Inventory for
Hearing Aids (Cox & Alexander, 2002). The remainder
reported
that
clinicians
generated
questions
based
on clinical experience (HHIE [Ventry & Weinstein,
1982]
and
Hearing
Aid
Performance
Inventory
[Walden, Demorest, & Hepler, 1984]) or based on mod-
ifying existing questionnaires (the Abbreviated Profile of
Hearing Aid Benefit [Cox & Alexander, 1995] and
Glasgow Benefit Inventory [Robinson, Gatehouse, &
Browning, 1996]).
In 2001, the World Health Assembly endorsed the
ICF for use as an international standard for describing
and measuring health and disability (WHO, 2001).
It offers a model that integrates biological, psycho-
logical,
and
social
aspects
of
human
functioning,
aiming to integrate patient and professional perspectives
to create a comprehensive list of categories relevant to
adult hearing loss (Danermark, Granberg, Kramer, Selb,
& Moller, 2013). Many groups across health conditions
have used the ICF to develop a ‘‘Core Set’’ which con-
sists of a comprehensive list of categories that are of
particular relevance to a specific condition. In 2008, an
international working group supported by WHO gener-
ated a Core Set for adult hearing loss (Danermark et al.,
2013). The aim was to identify which areas of function-
ing, disability, and environment were considered import-
ant from the perspective of adults with hearing loss,
using seven open questions. The questions used to elicit
information from participants were developed specific-
ally to address the different components of the ICF
framework describing the person’s level of functioning
with hearing loss. The brief ICF Core Set for hearing
loss has 27 domains within four category labels: body
functions, body structures, participation, and environ-
mental factors. ‘‘Body functions’’ describes the physio-
logical functioning of the body, ‘‘Activities’’ refer to ‘‘the
execution of a task’’ and ‘‘participation’’ refers to
‘‘involvement in life situations’’ (Granberg, Dahlstrom,
et
al.,
2014;
Granberg,
Pronk,
et
al.,
2014).
‘‘Environmental factors’’ comprises the environmental
factors such as the physical and social environment in
which people live their lives (Granberg, Dahlstrom,
et al., 2014; Granberg, Pronk, et al., 2014). However,
any patient-reported symptom that fell outside the ICF
framework were excluded, and so even in this, essential
symptoms may not be reflected in the Core Sets for hear-
ing loss.

Trends in Hearing
 Further, hearing loss affects not only the individual but
also thoseclose to them(Kamil &Lin, 2015). This group of
people
are
often
called
‘‘communication
partners’’
(Manchaiah & Stephens, 2012). The term communication
partners is here taken as referring to ‘‘those with whom the
person with hearing impairment communicates with on a
regular basis . . . their spouse, siblings, children, friends,
relatives, colleagues, and carers’’ (Manchaiah, Stephens,
Zhao, & Kramer, 2012, p. 1). Two reviews are already
available of the growing body of literature on the impact
of hearing loss on communication partners. One identified
24 articles relating to the impact of hearing loss on the
communication partner (Kamil & Lin, 2015). This system-
atic review included observational clinical studies, rando-
mized clinical trials, and epidemiologic studies, and so the
focus of data synthesis was based on outcome metrics and
study findings, more so than on self-reported experiences.
The authors identified social life, burden of communica-
tion, and quality of life as emerging dimensions of generic
and hearing-specific complaints; they also identified a gap
in knowledge about the effects on the communication
partner’s mental health. The review also focussed on the
quality of life and mental health of communication part-
ners. However, the authors did not synthesize studies that
explored the impact on those experiencing or diagnosed
with hearing loss. Baker et al. (2017) conducted a meta-
synthesis of qualitative literature that explored the evi-
dence for the psychosocial implications of hearing loss
for people with hearing loss and their communication
partners.
The
authors
identified
four
overarching
themes: the effect of hearing loss, the response to hear-
ing(s), stigma and identity, and coping strategies (Barker
et al., 2017).
To date, there has been no comprehensive synthesis of
what patients and their communication partners them-
selves report is the impact of hearing loss on them.
Accordingly, the present review is novel in that its first
primary objective is to collect and synthesize generic and
hearing-specific complaints in everyday life that are
reported by people with hearing loss and their commu-
nication partners. We generated two frameworks sum-
marizing the data about living with hearing loss: (a) the
personal impact of hearing loss from the perspective of
the PHI (termed the Domains of Hearing Loss-person
with hearing loss, ‘‘DoHL-P,’’ framework) and (b) the
impact hearing loss from the perspective of communica-
tion partners (‘‘DoHL-CP’’ framework). These frame-
works
consist
of
a
hierarchical
framework
with
supradomain, domain, and subdomain groupings, all
using inductive (data-driven) methods. A ‘‘domain’’
refers to a broad area of life that is negatively affected
by hearing loss (e.g., hearing sounds; see Results section
for details). A ‘‘subdomain’’ refers to a distinct aspect of
life that is affected by hearing loss such as a particular
situation or scenario (e.g., hearing telephone ring).
A ‘‘supra-domain’’ aims to broadly categorize the
domains (e.g., auditory). Subsequently, we then sought
to (a) identify similarities and differences in the evidence
collected from people with hearing loss and from com-
munication partner(s), (b) compare the DoHL-P with the
ICF Core Set for hearing loss, and (c) investigate
whether any domains or subdomains vary as a function
of hearing loss severity (data permitting).
Materials and Methods
We followed the search strategy, data collection and syn-
thesis methods, and the quality assessment as laid out in
a predefined protocol (Vas, Akeroyd, & Hall, 2016).
Note that the study is now considered to be a synthesis
of the research evidence rather than a systematic review.
This is because the heterogeneity of the included studies
in terms of qualitative and quantitative data collection,
prevented meta-analysis and risk of bias assessment
(key components of a systematic review) from being
carried out.
Inclusion Criteria
We searched for studies that have reported what adults
with hearing loss and communication partners report as
problematic in everyday life. To be eligible for inclusion
in the review, studies must have recruited adults (men
and/or women) 5 18 years old who had been diagnosed
with mild-to-profound hearing loss as the primary con-
dition of interest or communication partner(s) who could
be of any age or hearing status. Participants were
required to use oral communication as their primary
mode of communication, but there was no restriction
to those people using hearing aids or other assistive lis-
tening devices. Any studies that investigated the perspec-
tive of professionals only regarding the impact of hearing
loss were excluded because it was not in the scope of our
research question.
We included intervention studies where data in these
studies were taken at the initial assessment, as well as
non-intervention studies. There was no restriction on
the type of study design. Resource and language limita-
tions within the team led us to limit studies to those
published in the English language. The search was
limited to publications on or after May 1, 1982, because
the HHIE questionnaire (Ventry & Weinstein, 1982) was
published then. Eligible publications were journal art-
icles, book chapters, and conference proceedings that
reported interventions, observational or cross-sectional
studies, and those that employed questionnaires, inter-
views, or focus groups to collect data relating to our
primary question, but case reports, articles for profes-
sional magazines, and web-based discussion forums
were excluded. Published systematic reviews were not

 subject to the data collection process itself, but their
reference lists were manually searched to identify any
additional eligible studies. There were no restrictions
on research settings.
Information Sources
To support an exhaustive literature search, published art-
icles were identified through numerous electronic data-
bases: Cos Conference Papers Index, the Cumulative
Index
to
Nursing
and
Allied
Health
Literature,
Excerpta
Medica
Database,
PubMed
(including
MEDLINE), and Web of Science. Google Scholar was
also searched page by page until it contained no relevant
articles. All electronic searches were conducted on August
31, 2015. Finally, to ensure that the review was up-to-
date, we conducted a manual search of the top four jour-
nals in which eligible studies had been sourced (i.e., Ear
and
Hearing,
International
Journal
of
Audiology,
Audiology, and Journal of the American Academy of
Audiology) from August 2015 to April 2017. This final
manual search was conducted on May 3, 2017.
Search Strategy
The electronic database search required ‘‘hearing’’ in the
title or abstract, in conjunction with additional relevant
search times in the title or abstract. The search strategy
was reported in the protocol (Vas, Akeroyd, & Hall,
2016), but in brief, the search terms were as follows:
(a) hearing AND problem OR complain* OR symptom
OR impairment OR difficult* OR concern* OR impact
AND (b) patient OR communication partner OR part-
ner OR spouse OR significant (other) OR famil*. The
search strategy was modified to accommodate to the set-
tings of each database and where possible was limited to
humans, adult, English language, and post-May 1982.
Study Selection
Study selection commenced once searches of the pre-
selected databases were conducted, and it consisted of
three stages: title screening, abstract screening, and full-
text review. First, all of the studies derived from each
database search were screened for inclusion by one
researcher (VV). Studies that were evidently irrelevant to
the eligibility criteria of the systematic review based on the
title were excluded. Next, the abstracts of studies that
passed the title screen were independently screened in an
unblinded standardized manner by two reviewers (DAH
and VV). The reviewers screened the abstracts according
to the eligibility criteria of the review, such as the object-
ives, methods, and language of the study. Disagreements
between reviewers were resolved through discussion.
The full text of studies that met the eligibility criteria
based on the abstract or where there was uncertainty
were obtained for review. The full text of studies were
then independently screened by the same two reviewers
according to the eligibility criteria. Those that met inclu-
sion of the review were retained for data collection.
Data Collection Process
Data collection was conducted using a prespecified elec-
tronic data collection form. To minimize observer bias,
guidance material was created prior to the data collec-
tion process (see Supplementary file A), and then the
data collection form and guidance were both piloted
and revised across three iterations by VV and DAH.
VV carried out data collection and consulted with
DAH and MAA to resolve any uncertainties.
Data Items
For each included study, we recorded the researcher
performing data collection, study authors, title, year of
publication, type of publication (e.g., journal article,
book chapter, or conference paper), and country of
origin. For the study characteristics, we recorded the
study design, whether or not hearing loss was the pri-
mary condition of interest, the wording of questions
(open, closed, or open and closed), sample size, and
theoretical framework reported by authors (if any). For
the data items relating to participant characteristics, we
recorded their mean age, gender, setting (e.g., academic,
clinical), and hearing status (including mean audiometric
thresholds, description of hearing loss severity, or eti-
ology of hearing loss).
For the complaints reported by both the PHI and
their communication partners, we recorded the measure
used to obtain each hearing loss complaint or domain
(questionnaire, interview, or focus group), the domain as
described in the text, author examples or participant
quotes describing their complaints, and perspective
(referring to self or to other). For studies using closed-
set questionnaires to assess the impact of hearing loss, we
extracted data only for those subscales or questionnaire
items that had been highlighted by the study findings or
conclusions as reflecting experienced complaints (i.e., we
did not simply extract data indiscriminately on all sub-
scales or items of a questionnaire). For intervention stu-
dies, data pertaining to our research question was only
extracted at the initial assessment and therefore we did
not extract information about effectiveness of treat-
ments. Given that our primary research question was
to identify what are the reported complaints in everyday
life experienced by adults with hearing loss as well as
their communication partners, our data collection care-
fully considered those complaints, examples, and quotes
given by each party in terms of how hearing loss affected

 them personally. The terminology used by study authors,
in the form of reported examples or quotes, was import-
ant to help us understand each authors’ epistemological
frame and hence to interpret their concept of each
domain.
Synthesis of Results
Reported complaints, examples, and quotes associated
with hearing loss typically referred to the negative func-
tional impact on hearing ability or other psychosocial
consequences of hearing loss, but examples were wide
ranging. The aim of the data synthesis was to identify
and group together similar data characteristics across
studies into domains, and so data synthesis used a
meta-ethnographic approach (Campbell et al., 2011;
Noblit & Hare, 1988). Meta-ethnography aims to iden-
tify commonality across studies allowing for themes to
emerge from the qualitative data. It thus utilizes an
inductive approach, resulting in a reconceptualization
of the data, and so is appropriate for synthesizing the
qualitative data extracted from the included publica-
tions. Data synthesis was guided by Noblit’s (Noblit &
Hare, 1988) method.
Getting started. The specific research question that data
synthesis aimed to address was to collect and synthesize
generic and hearing-specific complaints in everyday life
that are reported by people with hearing loss and also by
communication partners.
Deciding what is relevant to the initial interest. The scope of
the synthesis was to focus on what studies had reported
the personal impact of hearing loss on individuals with
hearing loss and the personal impact of hearing loss on
communication partners. Studies included in the data
synthesis were assumed to be of acceptable quality in
terms of methods and reliability of results.
Reading the studies. Familiarization of the studies was first
conducted in the study screening stage of the abstracts
and full text of the studies. Data pertaining to the
research question was extracted for data synthesis
during the data collection process.
Determining how the studies are related. The first step of
synthesizing the data required searching for and group-
ing the domain data under descriptive labels that
contained recurring keywords, such as ‘‘stigma’’ and
‘‘withdrawal.’’ All of the extracted complaints and
domains were printed onto card for analysis by the
research team. To clearly identify which complaints
were comparable, the printed cards were sorted into
groups, then the researchers looked through the cards
for
common
and
recurring
themes.
The
extracted
qualitative data were synthesized at domain level in the
first instance. Preliminary domain groupings emerged
from the given words, phrases, and sentences taken dir-
ectly from the full texts (without any abstraction).
Complaints that appeared to be nonspecific (e.g., ‘‘back-
ground noise’’ or ‘‘domestic life’’) or contained limited
information (e.g., ‘‘public incidents’’ or ‘‘dependence’’)
were temporarily placed in a ‘‘miscellaneous’’ group
and carried forward to further review. Individual data
items that could not be consolidated into the final
domain
grouping
framework
are
reported
as
Supplementary file (available in Supplementary file B).
Translating the studies into one another. The preliminary
groupings were then thoroughly reviewed by the research
team. The descriptive labels used to name each grouping
were also reviewed based on the revised domain key-
words. Suggestions were shared among all three authors
leading to a harmonization of the domain classification
(Saldan
˜ a, 2015).
Synthesizing translations. At this stage, not only did we
refine
the
domain
groupings
and
their
descriptive
labels, but we also created supra-domains (termed
Auditory, Social, Self) at a higher level of abstraction
(Campbell et al., 2003), and subdomains at a higher
level of scrutiny. Following the development of the
domains, data grouped within each domain were then
split into more specific groups. Subdomains captured
the richness of the dataset and enabled greater distinc-
tion between complaints within each domain grouping.
This step was again completed via consensus of the
research team. The dataset and domain groupings were
analyzed using a more interpretative level of scrutiny,
rather than simply relying on the linguistic terms of the
dataset alone. This stage involved paying meticulous
attention to the corresponding examples and quotes for
each domain in order to interpret the underlying con-
cepts and semantics intended by the original investigator.
The researchers ensured that the data grouped within
each subdomain were representative of the subdomain.
This required the researchers to move back and forth
between the data to ensure the data were placed appro-
priately within the subdomains and to identify any over-
lap
or
differences
in
the
emerging
domain
and
subdomain groupings. Again, subdomain labels were
created using representative words or phrases from
within the dataset, thus adopting a bottom-up approach.
At this point, it was observed that some of the subdo-
main items combined several aspects of complaint and
could therefore potentially be allocated to more than one
subdomain. This was particularly true for examples or
quotes that stated an experience with an underlying emo-
tional construct; for example, ‘‘frustration in communi-
cating at work’’ or ‘‘upset to know others are aware of
Vas et al.
5
 hearing problem.’’ In these cases, the individual com-
plaint or example were assigned to multiple subdomains.
There were some domains and subdomains that emerged
from multiple data items. However, the development of a
subdomain was not based on the number of data items
reporting that particular subdomain, but based on the
uniqueness of the construct contained within the data.
For example, a subdomain could have emerged from
data contained within one item if that item could not
be consolidated to another subdomain.
Expressing the synthesis. We collated the domain groupings
from the two perspectives to create two frameworks: one
for the PHI and one for the communication partner.
These domains sit within a very broad scope of hearing
loss complaints, ranging from listening-related com-
plaints to emotional consequences. As described earlier,
this breadth guided our decision to structure the frame-
works in a hierarchical manner with supra-domains,
domains, and subdomains.

Study Selection
The electronic search identified 12,096 studies in total:

(;
n¼753),
Excerpta

Database
(n¼4,484),
PubMed (n¼1,697), Web of Science (n¼4,906), and
Google Scholar (n¼25). The flow of studies through
the review process is illustrated in Figure 1. There were
2,579 duplicates, leaving 9,516 studies for title screening.
Title screening (VV) removed a further 8,957 studies
leaving 559 studies for abstract screening (VV and
DAH). At this stage, any record judged as potentially
relevant by either author or any record with no abstract
was taken forward to full-text reading. Abstract screen-
ing removed 341 studies. In total, 222 studies were eli-
gible for full-text review, with this number including four
studies identified by the manual search of reference lists.
Eight studies subsequently had to be excluded as the
research team were unable to obtain a full text, and
two were excluded because they were not available in
English (Badran, 2001; Sebastian, Varghese, & Gowri,
2015). VV and DAH independently reviewed the remain-
ing 214 full texts against the inclusion criteria. A total of
75 studies met inclusion at this point. A further three
eligible studies were identified following the manual
search update. For these additional studies, the title
and
abstracts
were
screened
by
two
researchers.
Therefore, a total of 78 studies met inclusion. All reasons
for exclusion were agreed between VV and DAH and are
reported in Figure 1. Full citations of these 78 included
articles can be found in the Supplementary file (see
Supplementary file C).
Study Characteristics
Most of the included studies focused on the impact of
hearing loss on the PHI only (n¼49). Fewer studies inves-
tigated its effects on the communication partner (n¼11),

 but there were another 18 publications exploring both
perspectives as part of the same study. The age of partici-
pants ranged from 18 to 92. Sixty-four studies reflected
the views of both men and women; two publications
recruited men only (Hetu, Riverin, Getty, Lalande, &
St-Cyr, 1990; Jonsson & Hedelin, 2012), one recruited
women only (Magilvy, 1985), and 10 studies did not
report gender. Sample sizes ranged from n¼9 (Jonsson
& Hedelin, 2012) to n¼4,266 (Stephens, Lewis, Charny,
Farrow, & Francis, 1990). In terms of data collection
methods, 44 studies used questionnaires and 34 used
qualitative methods. Of those 34 studies, only 11 reported
the questions used to elicit complaints, and of those only 9
used open-worded questions: six with people with hearing
loss (Hetu, Riverin, Lalande, Getty, & St-Cyr, 1988;
Jonsson & Hedelin, 2008; Kelly & Atcherson, 2011;
Stephens et al., 1990; Wallhagen & Stawbridge, 2009;
Yorgason, Piercy, & Piercy, 2007) and three with commu-
nication partners (Lormore & Stephens, 1994; Yorgason
et al., 2007); Stephens, France, & Lormore, 1995). Across
all included studies (quantitative and qualitative studies),
a total number of 996 complaints were extracted and ana-
lyzed (622 patient-reported complaints and 374 commu-
nication partner-reported complaints). These extracted
problems came from studies that investigated both the
auditory as well as the nonauditory day-to-day implica-
tions of hearing loss.
Synthesis of Extracted Data
The primary objective of this review was to collect and
synthesize the complaints with hearing loss for people
with hearing loss- and communication partner-reported
complaints of hearing loss. In the following section, the
main findings are presented separately for the two
domain grouping perspectives (people with hearing loss
and communication partner). Using the domain group-
ings, two frameworks were developed, termed Domains
of hearing loss-Person with hearing loss (DoHL-P) and
Domains
of
hearing
loss
–
Communication
partner
(DoHL-CP). All communication partner participants in
studies that investigated this perspective were spouses or
partners of the PHI. Included studies typically reported a
mixture of domains and illustrative examples, either in
terms of individual questionnaire items or participant
quotes. For this reason, we considered the data items
supported in the primary data synthesis to be equivalent,
irrespective of the study design, or analysis methodology.
The four additional studies identified in the updated
manual search were subjected to the same data collec-
tion. The extracted complaints of hearing loss were con-
sidered with our frameworks to decipher if any new
information or complaints were reported in these studies.
However, these studies did not identify any new domains
or subdomains that were not already in our frameworks.
Our classification scheme comprises of three overarch-
ing supra-domains. ‘‘Auditory’’ refers to domains relating
to perception of sound and speech. ‘‘Social’’ refers to
domains that represent the impact of hearing loss on
activities with friends and family, as well as attitudes to
hearing loss. ‘‘Self’’ refers to domains relating to self-per-
ception and personality. Each supra-domain encapsu-
lated constituent domains and subdomains. ‘‘Auditory’’
had 4 domains and 35 subdomains (Table 1). ‘‘Social’’
had 5 domains and 18 subdomains (Table 2) and
‘‘Self’’ had 5 domains and 28 subdomains (Table 3).
Many of the domain-level appear in both frameworks,
and this was true for the subdomain complaints asso-
ciated with communicating (‘‘Auditory,’’ Table 1) and
the
perceived
role
of
the
communication
partner
(‘‘Self,’’ Table 3), but not for other subdomains. The
tables list all the domains, and in the following text, we
highlight some. The domains reported by patients only
will be reported first, followed by those domains reported
by communication partners only, and then the domains
reported by both. The ‘‘Auditory’’ supra-domain con-
tained the highest number of subdomains. In total, we
found 58 subdomains for the PHI and 37 for the commu-
nication partner. Each domain will be described in turn
with the number of extracted data items used to form each
domain denoted by n. Note that the number of complaints
only marks how often the complaint appears in the sur-
veyed literature; it does not determine the importance of a
complaint, either to an individual or everyone.
Primary Objectives: Patient-Reported Domains
Auditory: Hearing. This domain corresponds to the passive
function of hearing, the ability to access sound, but not
always in the context of listening to speech. The seven
subdomains within this domain describe difficulties in
hearing various types of sounds. The most commonly
reported complaint was hearing warning sounds (n¼8
complaints) such as fire alarms. Specific problematic situ-
ations reported include hearing the telephone ring (n¼7
complaints), television/radio sounds (n¼5 complaints),
and the doorbell (n¼4 complaints). While these com-
plaints were not directly reported in the context of hear-
ing in the DoHL-CP, communication partners did
observe the increase in the volume of the television and
constantly having to answer the telephone.
Auditory: Listening. For people with hearing loss, the most
commonly reported problem of the 12 subdomains was
listening
to
speech
in
noisy
environments
(n¼17
complaints).
Social: Interventions. This domain focuses primarily on the
issues associated with any interventions an individual
receives for their hearing loss. Its two subdomains

Trends in Hearing
 cover the limitations of some interventions and unrealis-
tic expectations of hearing aids (n¼3 complaints) ‘‘ . . . a
hearing aid would be wonderful if they could solve the
problem . . . ‘‘ (Claesen & Pryce, 2012, p. 282).
Social: Occupational impact. This domain refers to prob-
lems experienced in hearing-impaired person’s place of
work, as a result of their hearing difficulties. The three
subdomains describe the impact of hearing loss on every-
day work-life, and particularly in relation to potential
implications of their hearing loss on job security (n¼4
complaints); for example, ‘‘Originally I was told that I
would lose my job if I needed to use interpreters’’
(Punch, Hyde, & Power, 2007, p. 511).
Primary Objectives: Communication Partner-Reported
Domains
Self: Role of Communication Partner. This domain refers to
any additional responsibilities or roles the communica-
tion partner has had to take on as a result of the limita-
tions hearing loss has imposed on their communication
partner that prevents them from carrying out certain
tasks. The five subdomains within this domain describe
roles relating to listening and communication in the
home and social settings. The most commonly reported
task reported by communication partners was having to
answer the telephone (n¼7 complaints) as well as having
to tell the PHI the phone is ringing (n¼2 complaints):
having to answer the telephone seemed to be that’s a
source of annoyance because it’s never for me . . . and I
have to take the call and then I have to go through the
Oh yeah, I’m well thanks, How are you? (Scarinci,
Worrall, & Hickson, 2009a, p. 2092)
This is due to the complaints relating to the telephone in
the patient domains, whereby a PHI avoided having to
answer the phone due to difficulty hearing the telephone
ring, as well as listening to conversation while on the
phone. Another reported subdomain, having to act as
an interpreter (n¼3 complaints), refers to communication
partners having to speak on behalf of the PHI, particu-
larly in social situations, ‘‘ . . . by the time you’ve tried tell-
ing him what they have said, they’ve moved on . . . ‘‘
(Morgan-Jones, 1998, p. 68). Communication strategies
or tactics employed by the partner to aid communication
with the person with the hearing loss were also explicitly
reported (n¼2 complaints) which more generally captures
the accommodations by communication partners to the
PHI. One explicitly reported strategy, ‘‘speech production
by partner’’ (n¼4 complaints), represents the communi-
cation partner having to raise their voice in order to facili-
tate effective communication with the PHI.

 Most of the difficulties encountered by the PHI were
also noticed by the partner, and vice versa. For example,
communication partners acknowledged that the PHI
does not often hear the telephone and PHI acknowl-
edged that they were more reliant on the communication
partner to answer the telephone. Partners acknowledged
the PHI withdrawal from social situations as well as their
own compensation to engage on behalf of the PHI in
response to the withdrawal.
Primary Objectives: Person With Hearing Loss- and
Communication Partner-Reported Domains
Auditory:
Listening. This
domain
refers
to
difficulties
experienced
when hearing is
purposefully engaged,
implying some degree of attentional effort, especially
but not always in the context of listening to speech.
The 13 subdomains (see Table 2) within this domain
describe listening problems experienced in everyday
situations both in the home environment and in public
spaces. The subdomain ‘‘raising the volume of the
television/radio’’ appears in both frameworks. Another
common subdomain was listening to speech on the tele-
phone (n¼10 complaints) to the extent that several exam-
ples reported individuals with hearing loss avoiding
taking phone calls (Hetu, Jones, & Getty, 1993; Hetu
et al., 1990; 1988; Miyakita, Ueda, Zusho, & Kudoh,
2002). The corollary of that was observed in one partner
domain, ‘‘Role of the communication partner,’’ where
taking responsibility for answering the telephone was
very common (n¼7 complaints) across the 29 studies
that questioned partners. The next frequently reported
difficulty for people with hearing loss was listening to
speech
in
noisy
environments
(n¼17
complaints).
Listening to the television and radio was also common,
resulting
in
having
to
raise
the
volume
(n¼14
complaints). There was a direct equivalent for commu-
nication partners, which was that of having to listen to
the television or radio louder than what they would
normally prefer (n¼ 9 complaints).
Auditory: Communicating. This domain refers to difficulties
experienced when actively participating in conversation,
where there is a mutual exchange of spoken information
between at least two people. All of the 12 subdomains
describe problems experienced in conversational settings
and these can be in the home as well as in public places.
For people with hearing loss, the most commonly
reported problems were participating in general conver-
sation and in conversation with a group of talkers (n¼13
and n¼12 complaints, respectively). Next concerned
asking people to repeat things (n¼11 complaints). The
result of that for communication partners was having to
repeat to their partner which was mentioned seven times
(n¼7 complaints). The second most frequently reported
challenge for partners was conversing on a one-to-one
basis (n¼5 complaints). Examples and quotes indicate
that this subdomain predominantly refers to conversa-
tions with the hearing impaired spouse: ‘‘When you’ve
spent forty years able to converse easily and then one
goes deaf it’s very difficult to adjust . . . ‘‘ (Morgan-
Jones, 1998, p. 65); ‘‘my husband sometimes gets
annoyed because I can’t hear and he has to keep repeat-
ing’’ (Hass-Slavin, McColl, & Pickett, 2005, p. 331).
Auditory: Speaking. This domain refers to changes in the
volume of one’s speaking voice that can occur as a result
of
hearing
loss.
There
was
just
one
subdomain,
‘‘speaking with a loud voice,’’ that appears in both
frameworks. For people with hearing loss, this related
to increases in the volume in their voice since the onset
of hearing loss (n¼2 complaints). For communication
partners, speaking problems also related to an increase
in volume of their own voice when talking to their hear-
ing-impaired partner (n¼3 complaints). For example, ‘‘I
have to raise my voice’’ (Govender, Maistry, Soomar, &
Paken, 2014, p. 52).
Social: Social life. Social withdrawal was the most fre-
quently reported subdomain overall (n¼42 complaints).
There was no overlap in the four subdomains across the
DoHL-P and DoHL-CP. Quotes given by people with
hearing loss made reference to the inability to fully
engage in a social event or social gathering, and physic-
ally removing themselves from the situation due to
experienced difficulties. For example, ‘‘I find myself
avoiding company because conversation is too much
effort’’ (Hallam & Brooks, 1996, p. 205) and ‘‘ . . . there
was a party I end up in the kitchen because it is
quiet there. If two or three are talking I can’t hear.
Then I left’’ (Wanstrom et al., 2014, p. 32). There were
14 mentions of the changes and quality of social inter-
action, for example, ‘‘I do communicate socially but
I find, I suppose because I am deaf, I don’t like con-
versations to be so long . . . that one has to think ‘Now
what exactly is that person saying?’’’ (Morgan-Jones,
1998, p. 78). Social life was the domain with the highest
reported data items across the literature included in our
review.
Communication partners made similar complaints.
Reduced enjoyment of social activities due to their part-
ner’s hearing loss was most common (n¼7 complaints).
For example, ‘‘ . . . he’s not participating in the actual
conversation and there’s just all this noise going on
around him he just switches off’’ (Scarinci, Worrall, &
Hickson, 2009b, p. 146). Indeed, one communication
partner complained that such difficulties had resulted in
him or her attending social events alone, ‘‘He might
accept a social invitation initially but he could also pull
out’’ (Scarinci et al., 2009b, p. 146).
10
Trends in Hearing
 Social: Isolation. The domain ‘‘sense of isolation’’ encom-
passed feelings of separation and exclusion from others,
especially in relationships or during social gatherings.
Again, there was no overlap in the three subdomains
across frameworks. For people with hearing loss, the
perception of isolation was very much in the context of
themselves in certain social situations (n¼26 complaints).
For example, ‘‘My hearing loss makes me feel isolated
from other people’’ (Hallam & Brooks, 1996, p. 205) and
‘‘I feel a bit left-out’’ (Morgan-Jones, 2001, p. 45). For
communication partners, complaints referred to their
general sense of being part of a couple (n¼8 complaints).
For example, ‘‘We don’t go along to our senior’s group
anymore . . . isolated at parties’’ (Scarinci et al., 2009b,
p. 2092). Furthermore, they reported feeling isolated as
a couple at social events (n¼3 complaints).
Social: Relationships. People with hearing loss and commu-
nication partners both acknowledged that hearing loss
can have negative effects on personal relationships. Of
the six submains, the subdomain ‘‘relationship with
spouse/partner’’ appears within both frameworks. For
people with hearing loss, changes in their relationship
with family members and their spouse or partner were
often attributed to their hearing loss (n¼8 and n¼5,
respectively). Spouses or partners were often identified
as the primary motivator for seeking an audiological
appointment usually as a result of the strain on commu-
nication: ‘‘My wife threatened me with divorce’’ (Claesen
& Pryce, 2012, p. 283). People with hearing loss also
attributed communication breakdown in their relation-
ship to their hearing difficulties: ‘‘acknowledge responsi-
bility in communication breakdown’’ (Claesen & Pryce,
2012, p. 283).
Negative effects on relationships were more promin-
ent with communication partners than people with hear-
ing loss. In particular, effects on the intimate aspects of
the relationship were frequent (n¼8 complaints). For
example, ‘‘My partner’s hearing difficulties has an
effect on our intimate relationship’’ (Govender et al.,
2014, p. 53), ‘‘I withdraw from my partner and we do
things alone’’ (Govender et al., 2014, p. 53).
Hearing loss sometimes also results in greater conflict,
threat, and misunderstanding in relationships (n¼3, n¼2,
and n¼1, respectively). For example, ‘‘there is no use in
discussing the problem with him. . .it does not work, it
always ends up in a conflict’’ (Hallberg, 1999, p. 53) and
‘‘I’ve threatened to leave him to fend for himself it he
didn’t toe the line’’ (Scarinci et al., 2009a, p. 2092).
Self: Emotions. Several emotional responses to hearing
loss, and to the secondary problems caused by hearing
loss were reported across both frameworks (Table 3).
In total, there were 11 subdomains. There were a
higher number of emotional domains reported by the
communication partner literature. Within the communi-
cation partner domains, feelings of frustration at their
partner for having hearing loss was the highest-reported
emotional subdomain. For example, ‘‘I understand she’s
got a problem but it doesn’t stop me from getting fru-
strated as hell sometimes’’ (Scarinci et al., 2009a, p.
2092). For those with hearing loss, negative emotional
domains
were
typically
in
response
to
limitations
imposed by their hearing loss (n¼11 complaints); ‘‘just
can’t hear what they’re saying to me . . . it’s just awful’’
(Claesen & Pryce, 2012, p. 279). The most common emo-
tion subdomain in the partner domains was frustration
(n¼14 complaints) of the difficulties hearing loss imposed
on several aspects of life such as at the compensation for
the social dependence of the impaired spouse or having
to
undertake
additional
responsibilities.
Another
reported subdomain was the burden of adjustment to
hearing loss (n¼4 complaints) experienced by communi-
cation partners: for example, ‘‘I feel that it’s actually the
other people who are with him who suffer more than him
because I think they’ve got to adapt their living style
rather than him’’ (Scarinci et al., 2009a, p. 2092). The
emotional consequences of having to raise the volume of
the television or radio was frequently reported (n¼6
complaints); for example, ‘‘What I find is when it gets
up too high, it aggravates me. I don’t get any pleasure
out of it . . . I’m not having a happy time’’ (Scarinci et al.,
2009a, p. 2092). This corresponds to the earlier result
that in the Auditory: Listening domain, loudness of the
television or radio was frequently reported as a problem.
Self:
Effort
and
fatigue. This
domain
refers
to
the
additional resources required to listen and participate
in conversation. It has six subdomains. The subdomain
‘‘feelings
of
fatigue’’
appears
in
both
frameworks
(patient: n¼13 complaints; partners: n¼12 complaints)
and across both frameworks. People with hearing loss
frequently reported exerting greater effort in order to
listen and follow a conversation (n¼8 complaints), and
consequently reported feelings of fatigue (n¼6 com-
plaints). For example, ‘‘I fell asleep when I was at the
meeting and after they said to me I know how you fell
asleep, because you couldn’t concentrate the whole
period’’ (Granberg, Pronk, et al., 2014, p. 783). For
communication partners, complaints related to effort
involved in
communication
comprised
the
highest-
reported subdomain, particularly due to frequent misun-
derstandings and communication breakdowns.
Self: Identity. This domain refers to the way hearing loss
has negatively changed an individual’s perception of
themselves, or, in the case of communication partners,
their perception of themselves as a couple. There are just
two subdomains. The subdomain ‘‘self-image’’ appears
in
both
frameworks.
The
subdomain

 inadequacy or self-esteem was highly reported (n¼17
complaints): for example, ‘‘ . . . there’s no connection,
you can’t hear. Well, it actually becomes part of your
self-esteem as well’’ (Jonsson & Hedelin, 2012, p. 318).
Persons with hearing loss complaining of feeling bother-
some to others, ‘‘I don’t find it too much of a problem
but other people do,’’ particularly during conversation
while having to ask people to repeat themselves. Another
frequently reported complaint was feelings in relation to
negative self-image (n¼6 complaints); ‘‘You feel incom-
plete . . . mutilated’’ (Jonsson & Hedelin, 2012, p. 318).
For communication partners, four complaints regarding
image related to striving to maintain the social image of
themselves and the PHI as a couple.
Self: Stigma. In this domain, the four subdomains reflect
the personal stigma that is associated with hearing loss or
hearing aids, and the behaviors resulting from those soci-
etal beliefs, as opposed to society in general. The subdo-
mains ‘‘denial’’ and ‘‘stigma of hearing loss’’ appears
across both frameworks. People with hearing loss particu-
larly identified complaints of stigma either of hearing loss
(n¼9 complaints) or hearing aids (n¼7 complaints). For
example, ‘‘having been diagnosed, I feel I have labelled
myself’’ (Morgan-Jones, 2001, p. 88) and stigma of hear-
ing aids, ‘‘I think that if you wear a hearing aid, people
tend to ignore you’’ (Hallam & Brooks, 1996, p. 206).
Admitting denial was a recurring complaint (n¼11 com-
plaints). For example, ‘‘When I became conscious of it the
hearing loss I kept trying to deny [it]’’ (Yorgason et al.,
2007, p. 219). Wanting to conceal hearing loss or minim-
ize the effort of participating in conversation was also
frequently reported (n¼7 complaints). For example,
‘‘Lots of times it is useful if you tell somebody something
and they say, ‘OK.’ Rather than no response’’ (Yorgason,
Piercy, & Piercy, 2007, p. 221).
Communication partners mentioned only the stigma
of hearing loss (n¼6 complaints). In particular, this was
made in reference to aging or a sign of ‘‘getting old’’ (see
also the Self: Identity subdomain).
Communication partners also reported being in denial
(n¼3 complaints) or unwilling to accept their partner’s
hearing difficulties were due to hearing loss ‘‘ . . . as a
spouse you actually perpetuate. I suppose you deny it
yourself as a well as a spouse. You say ‘Oh well,
maybe it isn’t as bad as that, maybe I’m just impa-
tient . . . ‘‘‘ (Scarinci et al., 2009b, p. 147).
Secondary Objectives: Comparison to Brief ICF Core
Set for Hearing Loss
The first of the secondary objectives compared DoHL-P
with the brief ICF Core Set for hearing loss. This com-
parator is of interest because it has integrated patient
and professional perspectives to create a comprehensive
list
of
categories
relevant
to
adults’
hearing
loss
(Danermark et al., 2013) and it was developed to provide
an
assessment
of an individual’s
functioning.
The
emphasis on the patient themselves means that the com-
parison to our frameworks can highlight what is missed
by not including their communication partner.
We conceptually mapped the domains in our DoHL-P
to the 27 domains of the brief ICF Core Set using the
descriptive labels of each domain and the ICF definitions
to assist in interpretation where differences were simply
due to terminology (e.g., ‘occupational impacts’ versus
‘remunerative employment’; Table 4).
Eight of our domains clearly mapped onto those of
the brief ICF Core Set for hearing loss, namely
‘‘Auditory: Hearing,’’ ‘‘Self: Emotions,’’ ‘‘Auditory:
Communicating,’’
‘‘Social:
Relationships,’’
‘‘Social:
Occupational,’’
‘‘Auditory:
Speaking,’’
‘‘Auditory:
Listening,’’ and ‘‘Social: Interventions’’. The remaining
six domains appeared to be unique to DoHL-P: ‘‘Social:
isolation,’’ ‘‘Social: social life,’’ ‘‘Self: effort and fatigue,’’
‘‘Self: stigma,’’ ‘‘Self: identity,’’ and ‘‘Self: role of com-
munication partner.’’ This result shows that all the
Auditory domains and some of the Social domains are
included in the ICF, but only one of the Self domains.
With respect to ‘‘Self: identity,’’ the brief ICF Core
Set does contain the domain ‘‘societal attitudes’’ that is
defined as ‘‘ . . . beliefs held by a social group about other
individuals . . . ‘‘ but this represents a different concept
than the one identified in our review which was con-
cerned specifically with the way hearing loss negatively
changed the person’s perception of themselves. Overall,
some of the patient-reported implications are not repre-
sented within the brief ICF Core Set for hearing loss.
Furthermore, while the ICF framework was designed
to be widely disseminated across the field of audiology
(Granberg, Dahlstrom, et al., 2014; Granberg, Pronk,
et al., 2014), it exclusively focuses on the person with
the health condition and excludes aspects relating to
the communication partner. If the ICF framework
solely was used to guide clinical practice (such as by
framing the patient assessment appointment), then it
would risk diminishing the value of implementing
family-centred care principles in audiological practice.
In subsequent analyses, we obtained from the original
authors (Granberg, personal communication, December
16, 2015) their data that was coded as ‘‘component not
covered’’ within the ICF (Granberg, Pronk, et al., 2014),
then mapped those onto the domains and subdomains in
the DoHL-P and DoHL-CP using descriptions of each
category (Supplementary file D). Due to the generaliz-
ability of the category names, the meaning of some of the
categories was ambiguous and could not be mapped
onto the framework such as ‘‘mutations’’ and ‘‘waking
up,’’ and therefore was placed in the ‘‘miscellaneous’’
category.
In
other
cases,
some
categories
were

 interpreted as being applicable to more than one domain
such as ‘‘participation’’ and ‘‘behaviour of others.’’ It is of
interestthatallofthe‘‘components-notcovered’’thatwere
mappedontothecommunicationpartner domainsfellinto
the subdomain ‘‘Self: role of communication partner.’’
This may provide a reason as to why these could not
be coded within the ICF since the ICF only captures prob-
lems experienced by the PHI. The absence of these cate-
gories from the ICF potentially excludes information
regarding the broader impact of hearing difficulties and
relationship changes due to hearing loss that are
considered important to people with hearing loss. Issues
concerning stigma and identity are not routinely con-
sidered by questionnaires such as the HHIE (Ventry &
Weinstein, 1982); yet, excluding those personal aspects of
hearing loss regarded to be important by patients and their
partners is not in line with patient-centred communication
principles and may have negative consequences for audio-
logical assessment and management decisions (Ekberg,
Grenness,
&
Hickson,
2014;
Grenness,
Hickson,
Laplante-Levesque, Meyer, & Davidson, 2015).
Secondary Objectives: Severity of Hearing Loss
We also investigated the pattern of reported complaints
in relation to severity of hearing loss, where hearing
status was adequately specified. Only 27 studies reported
the hearing status of participants, and even in these stu-
dies, there was considerable variation in the way hearing
loss was reported (e.g., mean pure-tone audiometric
hearing thresholds, sensorineural or conductive, or self-
reported judgment). Where possible, we graded severity
into three categories using UK audiometric descriptors
(British Society of Audiology, 2011) based on the
average of the pure tone hearing threshold levels at
250, 500, 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz: (a) mild hearing
loss (20–40 dB HL), moderate hearing loss (41–70 dB
HL), and severe to profound hearing loss (571 dB
HL). From these, a subset of 18 studies could be classi-
fied
(7
mild;
8
moderate;
2
severe-to-profound).
Extracted domains and complaints for mild and moder-
ate hearing losses were split according to these cate-
gories. We found that in total, there were 70 individual
complaints reported from studies that stated hearing loss
severity. Of those, 17 complaints were reported from
studies using participants with mild hearing loss, 44 com-
plaints from studies with moderate hearing loss, and 9
complaints from studies exploring profound hearing
loss. The breakdown of hearing loss-associated com-
plaints relating to hearing loss severity can be found in
Supplemental file E. There was insufficient data to cat-
egorize according to the extracted subdomains for the
severe-to-profound hearing loss severity.
Complaints relating to communication and speech
comprehension
were
the
most
commonly
reported
across the included studies, as well as emotional subdo-
mains. The data extracted in the present review showed
considerable overlap across hearing loss severity and the
domains extracted. The social impact of hearing loss,
particularly social withdrawal was also represented
across both (mild-moderate) hearing loss severities. The
classification of hearing loss severity, however, was based
on pure-tone averages only. Information regarding the
onset of hearing loss and duration of hearing aid use are
both important pieces of information for examining the
lived experiences of hearing loss as a function of the time
that an individual has to adapt to their hearing loss.
Neither of these parameters was consistently reported.

 Quality Assessment
Since we used an entirely data-driven approach, subdo-
mains can only enter our frameworks if they have been
mentioned by a patient or communication partner and
then reported in a paper. That is, should a potential topic
not be covered, or a patient forgets to say something,
then potentially important data could be missed. In gen-
eral, this cannot be ruled out, and so some measure of its
potential extent can be gauged by formally assessing the
quality of the studies. Such appraisals give a general
overview of the quality of reporting of the included stu-
dies and is considered an important component of
reviews (Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, 2009).
The application of quality criteria to qualitative
research
is
widely
debated
(Dixon-Woods,
Shaw,
Agarwal, & Smith, 2004). This is due to the lack of dis-
tinction between the quality and process of a study, and
those concerned with transparency of reporting (Dixon-
Woods et al., 2004). Several quality assessments for
qualitative research have been developed. However,
there is a lack of consensus as to those that should be
routinely adopted. This is also due to the argument that
different qualitative methods need to be appraised in dif-
ferent ways (Centre for Reviews and Dissemination,
2009), and appraising the most important qualities of
qualitative studies can be challenging (Dixon-Woods
et al., 2004).
We chose the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme
(CASP, 2016) to determine the assessment (Vas et al.,
2016). This is a 10-item quality appraisal tool developed
explicitly for use in systematic reviews (Centre for
Reviews and Dissemination, 2009). The CASP checklist
was applied to the 34 qualitative studies included in the
present review. Two researchers (VV and DAH) inde-
pendently appraised the qualitative studies using the
CASP checklist given in Table 5. Where there was dis-
agreement in appraisal for a particular study, this was
resolved through discussion. Overall, reporting of the
studies was adequately detailed and relevant consider-
ations undertaken. Where studies scored lower on the
CASP checklist was in relation to justifying the methods
used in the study; 24 out of the 34 qualitative studies.
Another item that did not score as well was a description
of risk of bias of the researcher conducting the qualita-
tive research (how data collection might have been
affected by the investigator-participant relationship),
with 20 studies reporting this.
The remaining 44 studies (all quantitative) were sub-
jected to a second quality appraisal as defined in the
protocol (Vas et al., 2016). Studies were assessed for
(a) reporting of sample size, (b) reporting a wide variety
of ages (mean and SD), (c) reporting of participant’s
gender, (d) reporting of inclusion and exclusion criteria,
(e) reporting ethical considerations, and (f) reporting of
data analysis. Each criterion was scored 0 (‘‘no’’), 1
(‘‘can’t tell’’), or 2 (‘‘yes’’): a score of zero indicated the
study did not report the item being assessed, a score of
one indicates that a judgment could not be made as to
whether the item was taken addressed based on what the
authors have included, and a score of two indicates the
study reported and addressed the item in question well.
Table 6 reports the results. The mean quality score across
all papers and criteria was 1.0 with a distribution of 121
‘‘no’s,’’ 122 ‘‘yes’s,’’ and 39 ‘‘not clears.’’ Across papers,
10 had at least three criteria marked at ‘‘no,’’ whereas
only 13 had at least three criteria marked at ‘‘yes.’’
Across criteria, the mean scores were 1.5 for sample
size, 0.1 for sample size, 1.5 for age, 1.8 for gender, 0.9
for inclusion or exclusion, 0.6 for ethics, and 1.2 for ana-
lysis. We conclude that there is much room for improve-
ment in the reporting of methods, especially in the
criteria of sample size and ethics.
Discussion
The primary objective of our review was to collect and
synthesize generic and hearing-specific complaints in
everyday life that are reported by people with hearing
loss and their communication partners. After extensive
searching, we found 78 eligible studies. Information pre-
sented across these studies broadly encapsulated audi-
tory and nonauditory complaints due to hearing loss.
These complaints were extracted from the studies then
organized as two hierarchical frameworks, DoHL-P and
DoHL-CP, each comprising the same three supra-
domains (Auditory, Social, and Self).
Across both frameworks, there were 14 domains and
79 subdomains representing the impact of hearing loss.
There was considerable overlap in some of these reported
across both frameworks. Many of the subdomains within
‘‘Auditory: communicating’’ were experienced by both
individuals with hearing loss and communication part-
ners. For example, individuals with hearing loss reported
difficulties participating in conversation in several differ-
ent situations, which in turn had impacted on the com-
munication partner. Another subdomain in the DoHL-P
was difficulty hearing the telephone ring and listening to
speech on the telephone. This was represented conversely
in the DoHL-CP within ‘‘Self: role of communication
partner’’ domain as ‘‘having to answer the telephone’’
and ‘‘having to say that phone is ringing.’’ This
domain overall comprises the accommodations or add-
itional roles communication partners have had to under-
take as a result of their partner’s hearing loss. It
represents the ways in which hearing loss has multifa-
ceted effects on those close to a PHI, rather than
purely at an individual level of someone experiencing
hearing difficulties. Across domains that were common
to both frameworks, there was some variability within

Trends in Hearing
 the subdomains: For example, the subdomains within
‘‘Social: relationships’’ of the DoHL-P from that of the
DoHL-CP. For people with hearing loss, this was not
acknowledged apart from the effects of hearing loss on
relationships with communication partners and family
members in general. Within the domain ‘‘Social: social
life,’’ communication partners reported that as a result of
the negative experiences encountered by people with
hearing loss, they experienced a reduced enjoyment of
social activities and attending social events alone. This
was also represented in the ‘‘sense of isolation’’ subdo-
mains where communication partners reported feeling
isolated as a couple at social events and a reduction in
attending events as a couple. This ties in with the PHI
domains of the subdomain of social withdrawal.
There were considerably more subdomains reported
in
the
‘‘Self:
emotions’’
domain
by
partners.
Communication
partners
reported
the
burden
and
stress of having to adjust to their partner’s hearing loss
as well as the emotional consequences hearing loss
imposed
on
the
relationship
with
their
partner.
Communication partners reported feelings of guilt and
upset in relation to the way they reacted to hearing loss
and their lack of understanding of the PHI’s difficulties.
Furthermore, communication partners reported far more
subdomains within the ‘‘Self: effort and fatigue’’ domain.
Effort in this context was particularly associated with
having to accommodate and additional responsibilities
and strategies undertaken to adapt to hearing loss. It is
noteworthy that fatigue in relation to communication is
present in both perspectives rather than the person
experiencing hearing loss alone.
The ‘‘Auditory: communicating’’ domain contained
the greatest overlap between patients and communica-
tion partners. This was particularly true for subdomains
relating to conversation in different situations such as in
noise or among a group of talkers. There was also some
overlap in the subdomains within ‘‘emotions’’ such as the
frustration, anger, and the upset of coping and living
with hearing loss across patients and communication
partners. In addition, self-image was a subdomain pre-
sent in both frameworks. For communication partners,
this was in relation to the image of themselves as a
couple in society following hearing loss, as well as the
image of the individual with hearing loss alone. Feelings
of fatigue, in relation to listening and participating in
conversation, were also reported by individuals with
hearing loss and communication partners which again
the shared problems hearing loss has on communication
which involves interaction with other people.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, most of the subdomains in
the ‘‘Auditory’’ supra-domain were unique to people
with hearing loss, particularly those associated with lis-
tening and hearing sounds. In addition, the occupational
impact of hearing loss on those experiencing hearing
difficulties is only present in DoHL-P. These subdomains
did not appear in DoHL-CP.
We presume that the overlap across the two frame-
works reflects different manifestations of the same
domain: that is, how a particular difficulty of someone
with hearing loss can have a secondary impact on their
communication partner. Audiological assessments in
clinic emphasize the hearing status of an individual.
Many clinical measures do not adequately capture the
psychosocial consequences of hearing loss from both
perspectives, and they are not typically aimed at commu-
nication partners. Considering the challenges encoun-
tered by communication partners as a result of hearing
loss may contribute a more complete clinical profile of a
patient undergoing audiological assessment and help
optimize
rehabilitation
outcomes.
Future
research
should thus explore ways in which these domains can
be measured in the laboratory in order to integrate a
holistic approach to clinical assessment of hearing loss:

 the DoHL-P and DoHL-CP can be used to guide the
development of such measures.
We found in the survey that 19 different question-
naires were used. We mapped their individual items
onto the domains and subdomains of the DoHL-P; see
Supplementary file F (those domains that are not
marked there were found in the qualitative literature
only). The resulting distribution is quite uneven. About
20% to 30% of the possible cells within the Auditory:
hearing, Auditory: listening, and Self: emotions domains
are represented by items, but only about 15% of the
Auditory: communication and Self: identity domains,
and just 5% or less of Auditory: Speaking, Self: Effort
& Fatigue, and Self: Stigma. Some subdomains (e.g.,
‘‘listening to birdsong’’, ‘‘reduced spontaneous conversa-
tion’’) were entirely unrepresented. No single question-
naire asks about every domain: the closest is the
Hearing-Dependent
Daily
Activities
Scale
(Hidalgo
et al., 2008) with seven mapped questionnaire items.
In the clinic, therefore, the full frameworks can only be
explored with a battery of questionnaires or utilization of
a questionnaire together with open-format questions.
Taken together, all these areas form part of a patient’s
concerns that need be considered and factored into
rehabilitation based on the patient-centered care model.
This is a well-established component of the delivery of
many health and rehabilitation interventions (Mead &
Bower, 2000); yet, despite being suggestsed for adult
aural rehabilitation, it is not yet adopted (Grenness,
Hickson,
Laplante-Levesque,
&
Davidson,
2014a,
2014b; Laplante-Le

Hearing loss is a chronic condition that affects the whole
family. Yet, to our knowledge, our work represents the
first endeavor to create empirically derived frameworks
of hearing loss complaints from literature that explores
the perspective of people with hearing loss and their com-
munication
partners.
Evidence
from
video-recorded
audiology appointments indicates that family members
have a strong interest in being involved and sharing their
experiences of the patient’s hearing loss, but that they are
typically discounted by the audiologist (Ekberg, Meyer,
Scarinci, Grenness, & Hickson, 2015). Interestingly,
some behaviors observed in these analyses showed how
family members sometimes self-selected to speak in the
appointment by responding to audiologist questions dir-
ected at the patient. This behavioral observation fits well
with one of our subdomains, ‘‘having to act as an inter-
preter,’’ whereby communication partners described
their role in speaking on behalf of the PHI. In another
video study, Ekberg et al. (2014) observed many closed-
form questions about medical and lifestyle issues, but
there was very little emotionally focused conversation.
From the same dataset, Ekberg et al. (2015) observed
that patient-expressed concerns often conveyed their
negative emotions, but that such concerns were not
always adequately addressed by the audiologist.
Kamil and Lin (2015) conducted a systematic review
to gain insight into the effects of hearing loss on the
communication partners of older adults (550 years
old) who are hard of hearing. The authors aimed to
describe the effects of hearing impairment on communi-
cation partners of those with hearing loss. Similar to our
findings, the authors found that the design of the
included studies that investigated the impact of hearing
loss on communication partners was varied, with some
studies using qualitative methods such as interviews to
gather information about the effects of hearing loss
(Kelly &
Atcherson,
2011; Scarinci
et al.,
2009a;
Scarinci et al., 2009b) or open-ended surveys (Lormore
& Stephens, 1994; Stephens et al., 1995). Other studies
used quantitative methods such as questionnaires. In
terms of hearing assessment, Kamil and Lin (2015) also
found that the study participant’s hearing was tested and
reported using a number of different methods such as
pure-tone audiometry, speech recognition tests, and par-
ticipant self-report. Due to the heterogeneity across stu-
dies, a meta-analysis could not be carried out. This also
meant that the authors were unable to draw conclusions
about the differences between those with hearing loss and
communication partners. However, the authors report
general findings regarding the role of communication
partners in terms of caregiver burden and becoming an
interpreter for the person with hearing loss. The impact
of hearing loss on the relationship of the communication
partner with someone who has hearing loss, the emo-
tional consequences, and impact on social life are other
findings reported. These are congruent with our findings.
A second prior review also gave findings consistent
with ours. Barker et al. (2017) found that the psychosocial
effects of hearing loss such as the negative associations of
hearing loss with old age affected persons with hearing
loss and communication partners and therefore acknow-
ledge these experiences to be linked. Barker et al. (2017)
also discussed the potential implications of the views held
by the communication partner. A communication part-
ner’s perception of the stigma of hearing aids could
subtly alter the PHI’s decision to get a hearing aid.
Altered self-image was noted from both person’s perspec-
tive, and the communication partner’s strategy of coping
was often linked to the idea of projecting a ‘‘normal’’
image of the couple to other people. However, the authors
search strategy targeted only those qualitative studies
exploring the psychosocial experiences of hearing loss.
The field of health psychology provides a number of
alternative frameworks for understanding a long-term
health condition and its personal impact. Heffernan,
Coulson, Henshaw, Barry, and Ferguson (2016) recently
18
Trends in Hearing
 described the application of Leventhal’s self-regulatory
model (Leventhal et al., 1997). This model proposes that
the ways in which a person construes their own health
condition affects the way that they cope with it and so
ultimately their health outcomes. Important mediating
components are thoughts and beliefs, and the emotional
reactions to the condition. Interviews with 25 people with
hearing loss explored these components of the self-regu-
latory model observing that ‘‘Most individuals with hear-
ing loss reported negative emotional representations of
hearing loss’’ (Heffernan et al., 2016, p. 6). Expressed
emotions included frustration, irritation, embarrassment,
and loneliness, which are captured as subdomains in our
own inductive domain-grouping frameworks. Initial com-
parisons suggest that our domain groupings are congru-
ent
with
the
self-regulatory
framework
and
the
subdomains identified from the data-driven analysis
could easily fit into this theoretically motivated frame-
work. For example, aspects of ‘‘disengaged coping’’
mechanisms are captured here as ‘‘Social withdrawal,’’
‘‘Pretending to understand speech,’’ and ‘‘Effort of
having to act as an interpreter.’’ Further work, beyond
the scope of the present synthesis, is needed to decide this.
The mean age of study participants across the
included studies was generally poorly reported, particu-
larly across the qualitative studies. For studies that did
report age, the mean was 66.7 years. The UK Time Use
Survey (2003) describes leisure choices made by older
people. People above 65 years old tend to spend more
time doing sedate activities such as watching TV and
listening to music (Soule, 2005). ‘‘Successful aging’’ has
been posed to feature social engagement, an aspect high-
lighted by our frameworks. This comprises ‘‘remaining
involved in activities that are meaningful and purpose-
ful’’ and ‘‘maintaining close relationships’’ (Adam,
Leibbrandt, & Moon, 2011). Good listening and com-
municating ability is essential in order to participate in
such activities. Giummarra, Haralambous, Moore, and
Nankervis (2007) interviewed older people to gain insight
on the relation between aging and social isolation. The
authors found that older people reported social connect-
edness and social activity to be strongly associated with
overall health. These components also form aspects of
life that appear in our frameworks, such as social life and
relationships that represent the negative implications of
hearing loss.
Strengths and Limitations of the Study
Our frameworks identify what experiences of living with
hearing loss are shared and what are unique to each per-
spective. The included studies demonstrated considerable
variation in the study population characteristics and in
the degree and etiology of hearing loss among partici-
pants. Many studies did not fully describe the hearing
status of the people with hearing loss and rarely if ever
disclosed the hearing status of the communication part-
ners. There may be cases where the communication part-
ner may have an undiagnosed hearing loss themselves,
and some of their own hearing difficulties might unknow-
ingly contribute to the experiences described here. These
limitations make it difficult to investigate how hearing
status might influence the type of experiences and diffi-
culties associated with hearing loss, but they also make it
difficult to draw generalizable conclusions. It is also
important to note that we did not find any data pertain-
ing to communication partners who were not spouses or
partners; there is nothing in the present literature about
impacts on other communication partners such as sib-
lings, children, friends, relatives, colleagues, and carers
(Manchaiah et al., 2012). Given that the interest in com-
munication partners is a relatively newer field of
research, this was represented in the comparatively
fewer data items extracted pertaining to this perspective
compared with the person with hearing loss data. Having
more data regarding the problems associated with loss
from the perspective of communication partners who are
friends or family members of the person with hearing
loss may give further items to the DoHL-CP.
While the derivation of these domains consisted of a
rigorous synthesis of a large amount of data, the
domains and subdomains only represent hearing loss
complaints that were reported by persons with hearing
loss or communication partners in the studies analyzed.
Every domain or subdomain could therefore only have
entered into the framework either by someone mention-
ing it in response to an open query or because there was a
corresponding item or subscale in a questionnaire. The
questionnaires extracted in the review tapped into
the subdomains depicted in the frameworks to varying
degrees. The breadth can be illustrated by three exam-
ples:
all
three
supra-domains
are
represented
in
the HHIE (Ventry & Weinstein, 1982), but only the
Auditory: Hearing subdomain is represented in the
Your
Hearing
questionnaire
(Slawinski,
Hartel,
&
Kline, 1993), and very few closed-set questionnaire
items concern issues relating to ‘‘Self: identity.’’ None
of the questionnaires analyzed here tapped into the sub-
domains of communicating at work, pretending to
understand speech, stigma of hearing loss, and stigma
of hearing aids.
There were a number of advantages to taking a data-
driven approach in developing the frameworks, the pri-
mary one being that the frameworks are representative
of patient- and communication partner-reported com-
plaints, with minimized researcher bias. This does
mean, however, that any complaints of hearing loss
that were not reported in the included studies do not
appear in the frameworks. The constructs represented
in the each framework were not based on the frequency
Vas et al.
19
 of reporting in the literature, other than the construct
being mentioned at least once within the extracted
data. All the domains and subdomains in the framework
are therefore equally weighted. What remains unknown
is whether that equivalence in weighting is a conceptual
reality: Do people with hearing loss and their communi-
cation partners actually consider certain domains to play
a more significant role in the daily lives? And to what
extent are those impacts common to most people? This is
a question for further research.
Conclusions
Currently, auditory rehabilitation primarily serves to
address
the
auditory
degradation
of
hearing
loss.
However, the consequences of hearing loss are multifa-
ceted and can extend to various aspects of life as well as
on people close to those with hearing loss. The DoHL-P
and DoHL-CP frameworks translate and summarize the
vast qualitative research evidence of complaints of hear-
ing loss into an evidence-based hierarchy. The data dem-
onstrate that these complaints are Auditory (hearing,
listening, communicating, speaking), Social (relation-
ships, isolation, social life, occupational, interventions),
and Self (effort and fatigue, emotions, identity, and
stigma). These frameworks highlight aspects of hearing
loss that are not currently addressed in currently aural
rehabilitation plans, especially the far-reaching effects of
hearing loss that may extend beyond the patient, particu-
larly the effects on family members and their involve-
ment the patient’s experience living with hearing loss.
This is particularly important during the early stages of
auditory assessment and diagnosis in order to form com-
plete a clinical profile of patients with hearing loss
and facilitate personalizing rehabilitation plans to con-
sider
the
patient
in
the
wider
context
of
their
circumstances.
