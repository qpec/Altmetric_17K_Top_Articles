Introduction
Cholera, caused by infection with toxigenic Vibrio cholerae 
bacteria of serogroup O1 (>99% of global cases) or O139, is 
characterized by watery diarrhea that can be severe and rap-
idly fatal without prompt rehydration. Cholera is endemic 
in approximately 60 countries and causes epidemics as well. 
Globally, cholera results in an estimated 2.9 million cases of 
disease and 95,000 deaths annually (1). Cholera is rare in the 
United States, and most U.S. cases occur among travelers to 
countries where cholera is endemic or epidemic. Forty-two U.S. 
cases were reported in 2011 after a cholera epidemic began in 
Haiti (2); however, <25 cases per year have been reported in 
the United States since 2012.
In 2016, lyophilized CVD 103-HgR (Vaxchora, PaxVax, 
Redwood City, California), a single-dose, live attenuated 
oral cholera vaccine, was approved by the Food and Drug 
Administration for the prevention of cholera caused by V. cholerae 
O1 in adults traveling to cholera-affected areas. Lyophilized 
CVD 103-HgR is the only cholera vaccine licensed for use in 
the United States. In June 2016, the Advisory Committee on 
Immunization Practices (ACIP) voted to recommend use of 
lyophilized CVD 103-HgR for prevention of cholera among 
adult travelers to areas with endemic or epidemic cholera caused 
by toxigenic V. cholerae O1, including areas with cholera activity 
Recommendations for routine use of vaccines in children, ado-
lescents and adults are developed by the Advisory Committee on 
Immunization Practices (ACIP). ACIP is chartered as a federal 
advisory committee to provide expert external advice and guidance 
to the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
(CDC) on use of vaccines and related agents for the control of 
vaccine-preventable diseases in the civilian population of the United 
States. Recommendations for routine use of vaccines in children 
and adolescents are harmonized to the greatest extent possible with 
recommendations made by the American Academy of Pediatrics 
(AAP), the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP), 
and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists 
(ACOG). Recommendations for routine use of vaccines in adults 
are harmonized with recommendations of AAFP
, ACOG, and the 
American College of Physicians (ACP). ACIP recommendations 
approved by the CDC Director become agency guidelines on the 
date published in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 
(MMWR). Additional information about ACIP is available at 
https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip.
during the last year that are prone to recurrence of cholera 
epidemics. ACIP considered evidence on safety and efficacy of 
the currently available formulation of CVD 103-HgR as well 
as that of a previously available formulation with identical phe-
notypic and genomic properties that was licensed and marketed 
in other industrialized countries before manufacture ceased in 
2003 for business reasons (i.e., not because of safety or efficacy 
concerns) (3,4). This report provides new recommendations and 
guidance for vaccination providers and travelers about the use 
of lyophilized CVD 103-HgR. These recommendations apply 
to adults aged 18–64 years traveling to areas with endemic or 
epidemic cholera.
Methods
ACIP work groups meet regularly to review all relevant data 
and prepare draft policy recommendations for ACIP consider-
ation. Work groups are chaired by an ACIP member and include 
at least two ACIP members and a CDC subject matter expert; 
relevant ex officio members, liaison representatives, members 
of academia, other CDC staff members, and consultants are 
included as needed (5). In addition to ACIP members and CDC 
participants, the Cholera Vaccine Work Group (Work Group) 
includes participants from the Department of Defense, the 
Infectious Diseases Society of America, the National Foundation 
for Infectious Diseases, and academia. Members include experts 
in cholera, travel medicine, immunology, infectious diseases, 
obstetrics and gynecology, epidemiology, public health, military 
health, immunization safety, vaccine policy, and the Grading of 
Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation 
(GRADE) approach, a framework for evaluating scientific 
evidence. The Work Group convened monthly teleconferences 
starting in August 2015 to review cholera epidemiology and the 
evidence for the efficacy and safety of CVD 103-HgR accord-
ing to the GRADE approach (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/
acip/recs/grade/about-grade.html). During teleconferences, the 
Work Group reviewed and discussed a summary of findings 
and evidence quality for relevant outcomes. Questionnaires 
were used to collect and summarize Work Group opinions on 
key outcomes, evidence type, and proposed recommendations.
At the October 2015 ACIP meeting, the Work Group pre-
sented an overview of cholera epidemiology and CVD 103-HgR 
to ACIP
. At the February 2016 meeting, the Work Group 
presented the GRADE review that summarized the strength of

evidence for each of the outcomes assessed (prevention of cholera 
death, life-threatening cholera diarrhea, severe cholera diarrhea, 
and cholera diarrhea of any severity; induction of vibriocidal anti-
body response; occurrence of serious and systemic adverse events; 
and impact on effectiveness of co-administered vaccines and 
medications; (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/recs/grade/
cholera-CVD-103-HgR.html). At the June 2016 meeting, the 
Work Group presented proposed recommendations, and after 
a public comment period, ACIP voted to approve recommen-
dations for use of lyophilized CVD 103-HgR. Postmarketing 
surveillance studies and additional data pertaining to use of the 
vaccine will be reviewed by ACIP as they become available, and 
recommendations will be updated as needed.
Summary of Findings
Lyophilized CVD 103-HgR is the only cholera vaccine 
licensed for use in the United States. Its efficacy against severe 
diarrhea (defined here as fecal output >3 L/24 hours) after 
oral toxigenic V. cholerae O1 challenge is estimated to be 90% 
at 10 days after vaccination and 80% at 3 months after vac-
cination (6). Studies of the previously available formulation 
(discontinued in 2003) demonstrated similar efficacy (7). 
Both the previously and currently available formulations of 
the vaccine were effective in inducing a vibriocidal antibody 
response, the best available correlate of protection against 
cholera infection. No vaccine-related serious adverse events 
were reported in studies conducted using either of the two 
formulations. Studies with the currently available vaccine 
formulation found a slightly higher prevalence of diarrhea 
(mostly mild) among vaccine recipients (3.8%) than among 
unvaccinated groups (1.6%) (8). No other differences were 
detected between vaccinated and unvaccinated groups in the 
occurrence of any adverse events. Supporting evidence for the 
Work Group’s findings can be found online (7).
Summary of Quality of Evidence Across Outcomes
The body of evidence, which included studies with the cur-
rently available lyophilized CVD 103-HgR formulation and 
studies with oral toxigenic V. cholerae O1 challenge, consistently 
indicated high vaccine efficacy and was judged to be GRADE 
evidence type 1 (evidence from randomized controlled trials 
or overwhelming evidence from observational studies), which 
is the strongest type of evidence. For safety outcomes, the data 
were more limited, because relatively few persons had received 
the currently available lyophilized vaccine formulation. Few 
studies evaluated coadministration of CVD 103-HgR with 
other vaccines or medications (9). Because of these limitations, 
the GRADE evidence for safety outcomes was judged to be 
type 3 (evidence from observational studies or randomized 
controlled trials with notable limitations).
Summary of Rationale for Cholera Vaccine 
Recommendations
Assessment of the risk for cholera in U.S. travelers was 
addressed through review of the cholera epidemiology litera-
ture and expert judgment. Although cholera is rare among 
travelers returning to the United States from cholera-affected 
areas, and cholera is treatable if medical services are readily 
accessible, certain populations are at higher risk for toxigenic 
V. cholerae O1 infection and severe outcomes, and a traveler’s 
risk status is not always clear at the time of consultation.
Risk for Exposure to Toxigenic V. cholerae O1
Persons at higher risk for exposure might include travelers 
visiting friends and relatives, health care personnel, cholera 
outbreak response workers, and persons traveling to or living in 
a cholera-affected area for extended periods (10–13). The pri-
mary prevention strategy for cholera is consistent access to and 
exclusive use of safe water and food and frequent handwashing. 
Nonetheless, travelers to areas of active cholera transmission, 
which include areas with current or recent endemic or epidemic 
cholera activity, might be exposed to toxigenic V. cholerae O1 
through inadvertent or unexpected means, despite efforts to 
adhere to prevention measures.
Risk for Poor Outcomes from Cholera
Cholera causes a profuse watery diarrhea leading to dehy-
dration, which can be rapidly fatal unless reversed with 
fluid replacement therapy. Poor outcomes from toxigenic 
V. cholerae O1 infection might be more common in travelers 
with risk factors for severe disease, including the following: 
persons with blood type O; persons with low gastric acidity 
from antacid therapy, partial gastrectomy, or other causes; and 
travelers without ready access to medical services (14,15). Many 
travelers will not know their blood type at the time of consul-
tation; however, an estimated 45% of persons in the United 
States have blood type O. Persons with medical conditions that 
would lead them to tolerate dehydration poorly, such as those 
with cardiovascular disease or kidney disease, might also be at 
increased risk for poor outcomes.
Work Group Findings
Through the GRADE systematic review, the Work Group 
found high-quality evidence that the vaccine is highly effective 
and lower quality evidence that it is safe. The available safety 
data indicate no harms except for a slightly elevated risk for 
mild diarrhea among vaccine recipients. Although cholera is 
rare, the Work Group concluded that a safe and effective vac-
cine that can prevent a potentially severe cholera infection can 
benefit certain travelers.

Recommendations for Prevention of Severe 
Cholera Among Travelers
Personal Protective Measures
All travelers to cholera-affected areas should follow safe food 
and water precautions and proper sanitation and personal 
hygiene measures as primary strategies to prevent cholera. 
Travelers who develop severe diarrhea should seek prompt 
medical attention, particularly fluid replacement therapy.
Use of CVD 103-HgR
CVD 103-HgR is recommended for adult travelers (aged 
18–64 years) from the United States to an area of active cholera 
transmission. An area of active cholera transmission is defined 
as a province, state, or other administrative subdivision within a 
country with endemic or epidemic cholera caused by toxigenic 
V. cholerae O1 and includes areas with cholera activity within 
the last year that are prone to recurrence of cholera epidemics; 
it does not include areas where only rare imported or sporadic 
cases have been reported.
The vaccine is not routinely recommended for travelers 
who are not visiting areas of active cholera transmission. Most 
travelers from the United States do not visit areas with active 
cholera transmission (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/).
Booster Doses
At this time, no data exist about the safety and efficacy of 
booster doses of lyophilized CVD 103-HgR for the prevention 
of cholera. The duration of protection conferred by the primary 
dose beyond the evaluated 3-month period is unknown. There 
is no recommendation for use of booster doses at this time.
Coadministration of Other Medications or Vaccines
Before cholera vaccination. The Vaxchora package insert 
states that CVD 103-HgR should not be given to patients who 
have received oral or parenteral antibiotics in the preceding 
14 days, because antibiotics might have activity against the vac-
cine strain. How long a person needs to be off antibiotics before 
receiving CVD 103-HgR is unknown; the duration will relate 
to the antimicrobial activity and half-life of the antimicrobial 
agent or agents. A duration of fewer than 14 days between 
stopping antibiotics and giving CVD 103-HgR might also 
be acceptable in certain clinical settings if travel is cannot be 
avoided before 14 days have elapsed after stopping antibiotics.
During or after cholera vaccination. A study of the previ-
ously available formulation of CVD 103-HgR found reduced 
immunogenicity when coadministered with chloroquine; thus, 
the manufacturer recommends that if chloroquine is indicated, 
it be started ≥10 days after CVD 103-HgR vaccination (9).
No data are available on concomitant administration of the 
currently available formulation of lyophilized CVD 103-HgR 
with other vaccines, including the enteric-coated oral live-
attenuated typhoid vaccine (Ty21a, marketed as Vivotif). Based 
on expert opinion of how lyophilized CVD 103-HgR buffer 
might interfere with the enteric-coated Ty21a formulation, tak-
ing the first Ty21a dose ≥8 hours after ingestion of lyophilized 
CVD 103-HgR might decrease potential interference of the 
vaccine buffer with Ty21a vaccine.
The effect of oral or parenteral antibiotics given after vaccina-
tion with CVD 103-HgR is unknown; antibiotics might have 
activity against the vaccine strain and thus might reduce protec-
tion from vaccination. Most (83%) vaccine recipients have vib-
riocidal antibody seroconversion by 10 days after vaccination 
(16). Limited evidence suggests that some vaccine recipients 
who receive antibiotics ≤10 days after vaccination might still 
have vibriocidal antibody seroconversion (Lisa Danzig, PaxVax, 
personal communication, January 2017).
Contraindications and Precautions for Use of Lyophilized 
CVD 103-HgR
Allergy. CVD 103-HgR should not be administered to per-
sons with a history of severe allergic reaction, such as anaphy-
laxis, to any component of this vaccine or any cholera vaccine.
Age. No data currently exist about the safety and effectiveness 
of the currently available lyophilized CVD 103-HgR vaccine 
in children and teens aged <18 years or adults aged ≥65 years.
Pregnancy and breastfeeding. No data exist on use of CVD 
103-HgR in pregnant or breastfeeding women. Pregnant 
women are at increased risk for poor outcomes from cholera 
infection. Pregnant women and their clinicians should consider 
the risks associated with traveling to areas of active cholera 
transmission. The vaccine is not absorbed systemically; thus, 
maternal exposure to the vaccine is not expected to result 
in exposure of the fetus or breastfed infant to the vaccine. 
However, the vaccine strain might be shed in stool for ≥7 days 
after vaccination, and theoretically, the vaccine strain could be 
transmitted to an infant during vaginal delivery.
Immunocompromised persons. No data exist on use of the 
currently available lyophilized CVD 103-HgR formulation in 
immunocompromised populations. A study of the previously 
available CVD 103-HgR formulation among HIV-positive 
adults in Mali found that vibriocidal seroconversion was 
slightly lower among HIV-positive than HIV-negative par-
ticipants (58% versus 71%) (17). No significant differences in 
occurrence of any systemic adverse events were found between 
vaccinated and comparison populations.
Shedding and transmission. Lyophilized CVD 103-HgR 
is an oral live attenuated vaccine that can be shed in stool and 
potentially transmitted to close contacts. The vaccine strain

was cultured from stool in 11.1% of vaccine recipients in the 
7 days after vaccination with the previously available formula-
tion (16). The currently available formulation of lyophilized 
CVD 103-HgR was not isolated from the stools of 28 house-
hold contacts whose stool was cultured 7 days after vaccination 
(16), and few (<1%) household contacts of persons vaccinated 
with the previously available CVD 103-HgR formulation had 
the vaccine strain isolated from stool cultured 5 days after vac-
cination. However, later transmission could have been missed. 
A study with the previously available vaccine formulation 
detected seroconversion among 3.7% of family contacts of 
vaccine recipients at 9 or 28 days after vaccination (18).
Reporting of Vaccine Adverse Events and 
Additional Information
Because surveillance for rare adverse events will add to 
information about the safety of CVD 103-HgR, all clinically 
significant adverse events should be reported to the Vaccine 
Adverse Events Reporting System  at https://vaers.hhs.gov or at 
1-800-822-7967. To enroll in a registry monitoring pregnancy 
outcomes in women exposed to lyophilized CVD 103-HgR, 
contact PaxVax at 1-800-533-5899. Additional information 
about cholera and CVD 103-HgR is available at https://www.
