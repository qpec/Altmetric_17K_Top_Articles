SUMMARY
Calorie restriction (CR) increases lifespan and im-
proves brain health in mice. Ad libitum low-protein,
high-carbohydrate (LPHC) diets also extend lifespan,
but it is not known whether they are beneficial for
brain health. We compared hippocampus biology
and memory in mice subjected to 20% CR or pro-
vided ad libitum access to one of three LPHC diets
or to a control diet. Patterns of RNA expression in
the hippocampus of 15-month-old mice were similar
between mice fed CR and LPHC diets when we
looked at genes associated with longevity, cytokines,
and dendrite morphogenesis. Nutrient-sensing pro-
teins, including SIRT1, mTOR, and PGC1a, were
also influenced by diet; however, the effects varied
by sex. CR and LPHC diets were associated with
increased dendritic spines in dentate gyrus neurons.
Mice fed CR and LPHC diets had modest improve-
ments in the Barnes maze and novel object recogni-
tion. LPHC diets recapitulate some of the benefits
of CR on brain aging.
INTRODUCTION
Nutritional interventions, such as caloric restriction (CR), influ-
ence aging and age-related changes in the brain (Mattson
et al., 2018; Wahl et al., 2016). CR improves cognitive function,
including learning and memory, in old rodents (Ingram et al.,
1987; Wahl et al., 2017), possibly mediated by its effects on car-
diometabolic risk factors, generic hallmarks of aging, specific
brain-related mechanisms (BDNF, neurogenesis) or nutrient-
sensing pathways (Wahl et al., 2016).
CR is not readily translatable in humans. Therefore, other inter-
ventions that recapitulate the benefits of CR on brain function
without the requirement for long-term reduction in food intake
are being explored. Recently, we utilized the geometric frame-
work (Simpson and Raubenheimer, 2012) to evaluate the
effects of ad libitum-fed diets varying in macronutrients and
energy content on aging. Mice consuming a low-protein, high-
carbohydrate, low-fat diet (LPHC, protein:carbohydrate �1:10)
lived longest and were healthier in old age, even when compared
to CR achieved by dilution of chow with non-digestible fiber
(Solon-Biet et al., 2014). The beneficial effects of LPHC diets
on lifespan are conserved across a range of organisms from
invertebrates to mice (Le Couteur et al., 2016).
The effects of LPHC diets on brain aging are unknown.
However, the observation that ad libitum-fed LPHC diets are
beneficial for lifespan and late-in-life cardiometabolic health sug-
gest that they may also delay brain aging. To test this hypothesis,
we evaluated the effects of four ad-libitum-fed diets varying in
protein and carbohydrates and compared them to a standard
20% CR regimen in mice. Metabolic phenotype and markers of
cognitive function and underlying neurobiological processes
were investigated with a focus on the hippocampus. Despite
differences in aspects of metabolic phenotype, ad libitum
LPHC diets conferred benefits to the hippocampus that are
similar to standard 20% CR.
RESULTS
Cardiometabolic Parameters and Body Composition
Systemic parameters were determined at 15 months of age in
mice fed one of five diets from weaning; diets are shown in
Table 1. Daily energy intake, which rose with dilution of dietary
protein by carbohydrate, was maximal on the 5% protein diet
(Figures 1A and 1B), consistent with protein leverage (Sørensen
et al., 2008). Overall, CR and/or 5% protein diets were associ-
ated with lower body fat and weight, glucose tolerance, insulin,
and leptin and higher adiponectin and FGF-21 (Figures 1C and
1K). These diets had no significant effect on insulin-like growth
factor 1 (IGF-1) (Figure 1I), whereas cholesterol was highest on
the 10% protein diet and lowest with CR (Figure 1L). There
were some differences between male and female mice as

 shown. Other differences found included: urea, albumin, alanine
transaminase and the exchange ratio of CO2 and O2 (respiratory
quotient, RQ) (Table S1).
Hippocampal Gene Expression
Hierarchical clustering of differentially expressed genes from total
hippocampus tissue revealed differences between the dietary
groups as visualized with a heatmap (Figure 2A). Principle
component analysis did not reveal differences between sexes
(data not shown) and were therefore combined. CR had a marked
effect on gene expression compared to control diet, while LPHC
diets were associated with intermediate patterns of expression.
The top-10 differentially expressed genes are listed in Table S2.
Protein-Coupled Receptor 17 (Gpr17) is the top upregulated
gene for all LPHC diets. CR was associated with altered expres-
sion of genes associated with circadian rhythm (Dbp) (Nikonova
et al., 2017) and neuronal proliferation (Dchs1) (Beste et al., 2016).
FPKM (fragments per kilobase of transcript per million map-
ped reads) values were used to construct a volcano plot for
gene expression that correlated with protein intake (Figure 2B;
Table S3). The top gene positively correlated with protein intake
was Gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor beta 2 subunit
(Gabrb2), that encodes GABAA receptors. The top gene nega-
tively correlated with protein intake was Zinc-Finger CCCH-
Type-Containing 13 (Zc3h13), which is involved in nuclear
factor kB (NF-kB) production (Gewurz et al., 2012).
Overlap of genes influenced by CR or correlated with protein
intake was determined (Figure 2C). Compared to expression
with control diet, CR was associated with 237 genes that were
upregulated and 238 genes that were downregulated. There
were 379 genes that were upregulated with lower protein (and
higher carbohydrate) intake and 438 genes that were downregu-
lated with lower protein (and higher carbohydrate) intake. Only 40
overexpressed genes and 34 underexpressed genes were shared
between CR and lower protein intake (Table S4), and several of
these were of interest, including Semaphorin 4B (Sema4b), which
is involved in synapse formation (Paradis et al., 2007), and
Carboxypeptidase E (Cpe), which is a trophic factor that might
influence neuron survival during aging (Cheng et al., 2014).
The effects of diets on biological pathways were determined
(Figure 2D; Table S5). Pathways influenced by diet included
several brain-specific and general cellular processes; surpris-
ingly few overlapping pathways were among the groups.
However, dendrite morphogenesis, synapse functioning, and
neuronal development pathways were influenced by CR and
dietary protein.
The changes in gene expression induced by the different diets
were compared to genes that are reported to influence aging in
mice (GenAge: The Aging Gene Database [http://genomics.
senescence.info/genes/]) (Figures 2E and 2F; Tables S6 and
S7). The patterns of expression (determined by log2fold change
compared with 19% protein diet) with LPHC and CR diets were
similar when categorized by genes that shorten lifespan (‘‘Anti-
longevity’’ genes) and those that extend lifespan (‘‘pro-longevity’’
genes). CR and LPHC diets upregulated and downregulated
both anti-longevity and pro-longevity genes in variable patterns.
Hippocampal Nutrient-Sensing Pathway Proteins
CR elicits beneficial responses in the hippocampus via expres-
sion of nutrient-sensing proteins (Pani, 2015), including SIRT1,
PGC1a, and MTOR. We found significant sex differences in the
hippocampal expression of these proteins. In female mice
SIRT1 protein expression was greatest in CR and 5% protein
diets while in male mice there were no effect of diet (Figure 3A).
In female mice MTOR activation (p-MTOR/MTOR) was lowest
with CR and lowest protein diets (Figure 3B) and there was a
positive correlation with MTOR activation and protein intake
(and a negative correlation with carbohydrate intake) in both
male and female mice (Figure S2A). PGC1a protein expression
was increased only in male mice on CR (Figure 3C).
The top genes that are consistently upregulated (Figure 3D)
and downregulated (Figure 3E) with CR from a recent meta-anal-
ysis (Plank et al., 2012) were compared with their expression in
this study. CR and LPHC had similar effects on the patterns of
expression. Several genes of interest, including Carbonyl reduc-
tase 1 (Cbr1), contribute to protection against oxidative damage
and ischemia (Kim et al., 2014) (Figures 3D and 3E; Table S8).
Hippocampal Markers of Neuroinflammation
Pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis
factor alpha (TNF-a), the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 and
brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were measured. There
was an increase in hippocampus IL-10 in lowest protein and
CR diets (Figure S1A) but no changes in TNF-a, IL6, or BDNF
(Figures S1B, S1C, and S1F). There were no significant differ-
ences among the groups in the number of hippocampus Iba1+
cells (Figure S1D and S1E). Next, we looked at total hippocam-
pus GFAP expression as measured by immunofluorescence
but were not able to detect any differences among the groups
(Figure S1G; Table S9).
Changes in gene expression were compared to those reported
to influence cytokine response (AmiGO online gene ontology
database: http://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo) (Figure S1H;
Table S9). The patterns of expression with LPHC and CR diets
were similar in terms of their effect on genes influencing cyto-
kine response. A gene of interest was Suppressor of Cytokine
1 (Socs1), which is involved in suppressing brain inflammation
(Walker et al., 2015).
Dendritic Spine Density in the Hippocampus Dentate
Gyrus
The lowest protein and CR groups had increased dendrite
spine density in the dentate gyrus (Figures 4A and 4B). However,

The changes in gene expression induced by diet were
compared to genes that are reported to influence dendrite
morphogenesis (AmiGO online gene ontology database: http://
amigo.geneontology.org/amigo) (Figure 4C; Table S10). The
patterns of expression with LPHC and CR diets showed
increasing upregulation of these genes as protein content of
the diet decreased and with CR.
Memory and Learning in Middle-Aged and Old Mice
The Barnes maze and novel object recognition tests were used
to assess the effects of diet on memory and learning at 13 and
23 months of age. Overall, changes in some parameters tended
to show a benefit for CR and lower protein diets primarily in
female mice.
In 13-month-old females, CR was associated with best perfor-
mance on the Barnes maze on days 1 and 2, whereas, in
23-month-old females, CR was associated with best perfor-
mance on day 4. The lower protein diets were also associated
with some trends suggestive of improvement, with the 15%
protein diet having the best performance on day 3 in the
13-month-old female mice and the 10% protein diet having the
best performance on day 3 in the 23-month-old female mice (Fig-
ures 5A and 5B). In male mice, the only significant finding was
that the 13-month-old mice on 10% protein diets performed
best on days 2 and 3 (Figures 5C and 5D).
The significant findings for the novel object recognition test
were that the 13-month-old female mice on the CR and 10%
protein diets had the best recognition indices (Figure 5E).
Interestingly, there was a negative correlation with body fat at
young age and subsequent old-age recognition index scores
(Figure 5G).
DISCUSSION
Aging is a powerful risk factor for the development of many dis-
eases, particularly dementia. Identifying nutritional interventions
that delay brain aging and can be easily implemented in
humans is especially important because no pharmacological
treatments have been discovered that maintain brain function
or reduce the risk of dementia. In this study, the effects of ad
libitum LPHC diets on brain aging were studied and compared
with standard CR.
Studies of CR and protein restriction on brain health and
neurodegenerative disease in aging rodents have usually shown
positive outcomes (Ingram et al., 1987; Mattson, 2010; Newman
et al., 2017; Pani, 2015; Parrella et al., 2013). In our study, CR
diets and LPHC diets were associated with modest improve-
ments in behavioral and cognitive outcomes, although the re-
sults were mainly limited to females and inconsistent. Of note,
the standard chow diet did not perform best for any measure-
ment at any time point or for either sex. The results provide
some support for the conclusion that CR and possibly LPHC
diets improve brain function in old age.
CR and LPHC diets had marked effects on systemic cardio-
metabolic outcomes, which are increasingly recognized as risk
factors for cognitive impairment and the risk of neurodegenera-
tive disease (Buffa et al., 2014; Dye et al., 2017). These results
are consistent with other studies of CR and LPHC diets (Simpson
et al., 2017; Solon-Biet et al., 2015; Testa et al., 2014). FGF-21, a
hormone linked with cardiometabolic health, was elevated in the
5% protein group, confirming our previous conclusion that
FGF-21 is driven by low dietary protein coupled with elevated
carbohydrate intake (Solon-Biet et al., 2016). Midlife body fat in
females was correlated with novel object recognition in old
mice, which parallels human observational studies linking midlife
obesity with subsequent risk of dementia (Tolppanen et al.,
2014).
We examined the effects of CR and LPHC diets on hippocam-
pal gene expression. Other studies have reported changes in
hippocampal gene expression with food restriction (Wood
et al., 2015), influencing age-dependent changes in gene
expression (Prolla and Mattson, 2001; Schafer et al., 2015),
including genes involved with oxidative stress (Schafer et al.,
2015) mitochondrial function and synaptic plasticity (Zeier
et al., 2011). Overall, we found that gene expression signatures
in CR and LPHC diets were different; however, there were
similarities when specific genes involved with brain aging were
analyzed, such as prolongevity genes, antilongevity genes,
and genes involved with CR, inflammation, and dendrite
morphogenesis.
The top upregulated gene for all three LPHC groups was the
G-protein-coupled receptor, Gpr17. Gpr17 is widely expressed
in the brain, particularly in neuroprogenitor cells and contributes
to myelination of axons and neuronal repair after acute injury
(Alavi et al., 2018). Intriguingly Gpr17 also has been found to
be involved with food intake; knockout of Gpr17 reduced
food consumption in mice (Ren et al., 2012). Our data suggest
that Gpr17 expression responds to dietary macronutrient
balance, which provides a mechanistic link between diet and
brain aging.

 The beneficial effects of CR on aging are in part mediated by
its impact on several nutrient-sensing pathways such as
SIRT1, MTOR, and PGC1a (Hadem et al., 2017), which also
have been linked with brain aging (Mazucanti et al., 2015). We
found that SIRT1 and MTOR were influenced by CR and dietary
P:C only in female mice, while PGC1a was markedly increased in
males with CR. Our results are consistent with other studies
showing a sex-specific effect of CR on nutrient-sensing path-
ways and outcomes (Mitchell et al., 2016).
CR has been reported to reduce pro-inflammatory cytokines,
increase anti-inflammatory cytokines (Willette et al., 2013) and
increase BDNF in the hippocampus (Stranahan et al., 2009).
We found that CR and LPHC were associated with increased
levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, which influences
brain response to acute injury (Garcia et al., 2017), while IL-10 in
macrophages

from neural injury (Zhang et al., 2015).
We couldn’t detect any effect of nutrition
on other inflammatory cytokines, including
IL6 and TNFa or the neurotrophic cyto-
kine, BDNF. Increased expression of glial
fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) has been
linked with inflammation, astroglial activa-
tion, and gliosis during brain degeneration
(Brahmachari et al., 2006). Therefore, we
investigated the effects of the nutritional
interventions on total GFAP immunofluo-
rescence expression in the hippocampus. We were not able to
detect any changes among the groups in GFAP expression, sug-
gesting that the dietary interventions in the current study did not
influence neuroinflammatory processes that have been associ-
ated with neurodegenerative disease.
The dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus contributes to the
consolidation and formation of spatial memory, and dendritic
spines in the DG are important for optimal neuronal function
and the formation of memories (Kesner, 2017). CR has been re-
ported to increase DG dendritic spine density in a mouse model
of diabetes (Stranahan et al., 2009). We found that both CR and
5% protein diets increased dendritic spine density, consistent
with the role of dendritic spines in cognitive and behavioral
outcomes and the response to dietary interventions.
We recognize limitations to the current study. First, analyses
of the hippocampus and metabolic data were acquired at only

 one time point, 15 months, which represents late midlife,
although our behavioral evaluation included 23-month-old
mice. Future research should focus on older mice and models
of neurodegenerative disease. We studied dendritic spine
counts in the dentate gyrus because of its critical role in
hippocampus-dependent brain function (Toda and Gage,
2017), but not other areas involved in memory formation (CA1
or CA3).
In conclusion, both CR and LPHC diets impacted on brain ag-
ing in the hippocampus. Although the behavioral and cognitive
changes were subtle, there were more dramatic effects on gene
expression, protein activity, and dendritic spine morphology.
Overall, the lowest protein, highest carbohydrate diets (5% and
10% protein) generated changes, which approached those
seen with CR. A very low-protein, high-carbohydrate diet may
be a feasible nutritional intervention to delay brain aging.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Animal husbandry and diets
Animals were purchased from the Animal Resource Centre (Perth, WA) and housed four per cage on a 12-hour light/dark cycle at
22-24�C at the Charles Perkins Centre at The University of Sydney. All animals were given free access to water and randomly as-
signed to experimental groups. Ad-libitum animals were given free-access to food while CR animals were given an allotment with
20% fewer calories than the average intake of their ad-libitum 19% protein counterparts daily at 3.00pm. Mice were weaned at
3 weeks of age and diets were started at approximately three months of age. Energy intake from each macronutrient was determined
and averaged daily from 12 – 15 months of age. Body weights were taken every two weeks and animals were routinely monitored
every week for general health. The ethics in this study were approved by the University of Sydney, animal ethics number 2014/752.
Diets were purchased from Specialty Feeds (Perth, Western Australia) and formulated to have the same total energy content
(isocaloric) but different ratios in protein to carbohydrate with fixed fat (Table 1). Each diet was based on the rodent diet AIN-93G
(Specialty Feeds) and formulated to contain all essential vitamins, minerals, and amino acids for growth in mice. The primary dietary
protein component was casein, the main carbohydrate component was starch, and the main fat component was soy oil.
METHOD DETAILS
Animal sacrifice and tissue collection
At 15 months of age a subset (n = 12 males, n = 12 females per group) of mice were culled. All animals were sacrificed between the
hours of 10am and 12 noon. Animals were sacrificed in randomized order to minimize experimental bias. After deep anesthetizing
with xylazine-ketamine (10mg/g bw), approximately 1 mL of blood was taken via cardiac puncture. The liver was removed, weighed,
and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. The mice were then decapitated and the brain was carefully removed. One-half of the brain was
immediately washed with ice-cold double-deionized water and placed into Golgi-Cox solution. The whole hippocampus was care-
fully dissected from the other half, immediately snap-frozen in liquid-nitrogen, and moved to �80�C until further processing. The
blood was placed into a ice-cold tube and placed directly into wet ice before centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 minutes for plasma
collection. The plasma was used for subsequent metabolic and systemic measurements. Males and females were analyzed sepa-
rately on metabolic measurements due to innate metabolic differences between sexes (Valencak et al., 2017).
Fat mass and lean mass
Fat mass and lean mass were measured by magnetic resonance imaging (EchoMRI 900 – EchoMRI LLC, Houston, Texas, USA). The
mice were awake during the process and snuggly put into a plastic tube before being placed inside the machine for approximately
1 minute. The machine calculated the fat mass (g) and lean mass (g) per each mouse.
Metabolic measurements
The respiratory quotient was measured by Metabolic Cage (Promethion, Sable Systems International, Las Vegas, NV, USA). Briefly,
individual mice were placed in each cage and acclimatized for 8 hours then left for 48 hours (2 dark and 2 light cycles). Calorimetric
data were calculated with the software and the average respiratory quotient was obtained during the dark cycle. Data are presented
as CO2 eliminated/O2 consumed (Respiratory quotient; RQ).
Glucose tolerance
Glucose tolerance was measured at 15 months of age. Mice were fasted for 6 hours before the test which took place in the afternoon
at 2.00 pm. Mice were orally gavaged with glucose (2 g/kg lean mass) and blood glucose levels were read by tail snip at time 0, 15 min,
30 min, 45 minutes, 60 minutes, and 90 minutes (Accu-Check Performa, Roche, Australia). The total area under the curve (AUC) was
calculated and data are presented as mm/l.min.
Insulin determination
Total fasting insulin levels were measured with an ultra-sensitive mouse insulin ELISA kit per manufacturer’s instructions (Chrystal
Chem, Elk Grove Village, IL, USA). Whole blood was added to each well in the 96-well plate containing 90 mL of the provided diluent
‘‘G.’’ 10 mL of blood was collected by tail snip and added to each well. The ‘‘mouse insulin standard’’ was reconstituted and the
standards were mixed (from 0.1 ng/mL to 6.4 ng/mL). 95 mL of the provided diluent and 5 ml of each standard was added into
each well, the plate was covered, and incubated overnight at 4�C. The plate was removed from 4�C and washed 5 times with
250 ml wash buffer and 100 ml of the anti-inulin conjugate was added to each well. The plate was covered and incubated for 30 minutes
at room temperature and subsequently washed 7 times with 250 mL wash buffer in each well. 100 ml of the enzyme substrate was
Cell Reports 25, 2234–2243.e1–e6, November 20, 2018
e2
 added to each well, covered in the dark for 40 minutes, and the reaction ended with the addition of 100 ml stop solution ‘‘F.’’ The plate
was read at an absorbance of A450-A630 and insulin concentration was determined by linear fit. Data are presented as ng/mL.
FGF-21 assay
The Fibroblast Growth Factor-21 assay was analyzed by ELISA (Biovendor, Karasek, Czech Republic). The mouse master standards
were reconstituted with the provided dilution buffer (40 pg/mL – 2568 pg/mL). 100 ml of standards and diluted samples (serum diluted
in dilution buffer) were added to each appropriate well. The plate was incubated at room temperature for one hour with shaking at
300 rpm and washed three times with the provided wash buffer. 100 ul of biotin-labeled antibody was subsequently added to
each well and incubated for one hour at room temperature with shaking. The wells were washed 3x with the wash buffer and
100 mL of Sterptavidin-HRP conjugate was added to each well and incubated with shaking for 30 minutes. The plate was washed
3x with wash buffer and 100 ml of substrate solution was added to each well, covered in foil, and incubated at room temperature
for 10 minutes, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of 100 ml of stop solution. The absorbance of each well was determined
by reading on a microplate reader at 550 – 650 nm and concentrations were determined with the standard curve. Data are presented
serum FGF-21 concentration in pg/mL.
Adiponectin determination
Adiponectin concentrations were determined using a mouse adiponectin ELISA kit (Crystal Chem, Elk Grove Village, Il, USA). The
mouse standards were reconstructed from the provided stock (0.025 – 1 ng/mL). Serum samples were diluted to the appropriate
concentration (1:10,000) in the dilution buffer. 100 mL of sample and each standard were added to each well and incubated for
1 hour at RT with shaking for 350 RPM. The plate was washed 3x and 100ul of the provided antibody conjugate was added to
each well and incubated for 1 hour with shaking at 350 rpm. The plate was washed 3x with wash buffer, 100 mL of substrate solution
was added and incubated for 30 minutes. 100 mL of stop solution was added and the OD was measured at 460/630 nm. Data are
presented as the Adiponectin concentration in ng/mL.
Leptin determination
Leptin concentrations were determined using a mouse leptin ELISA kit (Crystal Chem, Elk Grove Village, Il, USA). The mouse
standards were reconstructed from the provided stock (0.0 – 12.8 ng/mL) and serum samples were diluted to the appropriate con-
centrations. 100 mL of each standard or sample was added to each well and incubated overnight at 4�C. The plate was then washed
and 100 mL of the conjugate solution was added followed by 4 hours of incubation at 4�C. The plate was washed and 100 mL of the
substrate solution was added, incubated for 30 minutes, and 100 mL of stop solution was added to each well. The plate was read on a
spectrometer at an OD of 450/630 nm. Data are presented as serum leptin levels in ng/mL.
Cholesterol, Albumin, ALT, Urea, and Triglycerides
Serum cholesterol, albumin, ALT, urea, and triglyceride levels were analyzed by a Cobas 8000, c702 photometric module (Hitachi,
Japan) and all reagents were provided by Roche (Roche diagnostics, Germany). All analyses were completed at Concord Hospital
(NSW, Australia).
RNA isolation and processing
RNA was isolated using the Trizol method. 1mL of ice-cold TRIzol reagent (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was added to fresh-
frozen whole hippocampus. Tissue was homogenized using the bead method (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) for 30 s at 50 Hz. After
samples were let to sit on ice for 10 minutes, 200 ml of ice-cold chloroform was added and samples were let to sit at room temperature
for an additional 3 minutes. Samples were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 20 minutes and approximately 500 mL of the supernatant was
collected and added to an equal volume of ice-cold 2-propanol. Samples were mixed, placed directly on ice, and centrifuged at
14,000 RPM for 20 minutes. The supernatant was removed and the remaining pellet was washed with 500 mL of ice-cold ethanol
3 times before air-drying. The pellet was resuspended in 15 mL nuclease-free water and cleaned with DNase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA, USA). RNA purity was assessed using a nanodrop spectrometer (Thermofisher Scientific Australia) before freezing at �80�C until
further analysis.
RNA sequencing and analysis
Samples were processed by The Australian Genome Research Facility (AGRF - Victoria, Australia; http://www.agrf.org.au/) with
Illumina TruSeq stranded mRNA sample preparation and technology. RNA integrity was initially assessed by a bioanalyzer and all
samples passed quality control with RIN values R 8.0 and an A260/280 ratio of 1.8 – 2.0. Briefly, mRNA was purified via oligo(dT)
beads followed by fragmentation of mRNA with divalent cations and heat. 1st strand cDNA synthesis was randomly primed
followed by second strand cDNA synthesis. cDNA library preparation was prepared first by DNA fragment end repair followed
by 30 adenylation of DNA fragments and subsequent sequencing adaptor ligation. Finally, the library was amplified by PCR.
Primary sequence data were generated using the Illumina bcl2fastq 2.19.0.12 pipeline and sequence reads from all samples were
analyzed per AGRF quality control measures. Briefly, cleaned sequence reads were aligned against the Mus musculus genome (Build
version mm10). The Tophat aligner (v2.0.14) was used to map reads to the genomic sequences. The raw gene reads were generated
e3
Cell Reports 25, 2234–2243.e1–e6, November 20, 2018
 by featureCounts (v1.4.6) and the differential gene expression was analyzed by DESeq2 (v1.16.1) in R (package v3.4.0). The Gene
Set Enrichment analysis (GSEA) was completed by a SetRank method (PMID: 28259142). The heatmaps and Venn Diagrams
were generated in R (package v3.4.0). The heatmaps were generated from FPKM values of the genes that were considered significant
compared to the 19% protein group. For each heatmap, the red, white, and blue colors indicate higher than mean, close to mean, and
lower than mean expression of a particular gene, respectively, as measured by the row of standardized Z-scores. The rows are
organized by hierarchical clustering using agglomerative clustering with complete linkage and Euclidian distance metric. The volcano
plot and Venn diagrams were constructed by a Pearson calculation with the top 2.5% of genes in either direction considered signif-
icant. All genetic data are available at the online database GEO: GSE111778.
Protein isolation
Whole frozen hippocampus was homogenized using the bead method for 50hz for 30 s (QIAGEN TissueLyser LT) in 500 mL ice-cold
RIPA buffer containing Tris-HCl, NaCl, Triton X-100, Na-deoxycholate, SDS, and fresh protease and phosphatase inhibitor tablets
(Roche cOmplete, EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor Cocktail). The tissue was let to sit on ice for 10 minutes followed by 20 minutes of
centrifugation at 14,000 rpm. The supernatant was transferred to a fresh ice-cold tube and protein concentrations were assessed
using a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay (Thermo Scientific, Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit). Samples were then diluted to approxi-
mately the same concentrations before being stored at minus 80�C until further analysis. Protein lysates were used for subsequent
enzymatic activity assays, Milliplex Map Panels, and western blots.
Western blots
Lysates were prepared for bis/tris polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reduced conditions. Proteins were transferred to nitro-
cellulose membranes (Invitrogen) and immediately stained with Ponceau S dye (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) for rapid and
reversible visualization of total protein per lane. Protein expression was detected using specific primary antibodies. Antibodies raised
against p-MTOR (#2971; 1:000), MTOR (#2983; 1:1000), SIRT1 (#9475; 1:750), and b-ACTIN (#4970; 1:1000) were purchased from
Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA, USA). Antibodies raised against DREBRIN (ab60933; 1:000), GAPDH (ab9485; 1:1000), and
PGC1-a (ab54481; 1:1000) were purchased from abcam (Cambridge, UK). All antibodies were detected using secondary rabbit
IgG-horse radish peroxidase (#7074; 1:5000) purchased from Cell-Signaling and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence
(GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA). Levels of specific proteins were normalized to total protein as visualized to ponceau S staining
(Eaton et al., 2013) and band densitometric values analyzed with ImageJ (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Loading con-
trols GAPDH and ACTIN bands are shown along with their representative blots solely for comparison purposes.
Milliplex map panel enzymatic activity assays
Levels of IL-6, IL-10, and TNFa were assessed using the mouse cytokine/chemokine magnetic bead panel 96-Well Plate Assay (Cat #
MCYTOMAG – 70K, EMD Millipore Corporation, Billerica, MA, USA) per manufacturer’s instructions. After a plate wash, 25ul of each
standard or control was added to the appropriate wells followed by 25 mL of assay buffer to the sample wells. 25 mL of whole hippo-
campal tissue lysates were added to the appropriate wells followed by 25 mL of premixed cytokine panel beads. The plate was sealed,
covered with aluminum foil, and incubated overnight at 4�C. The following day the plate was removed from 4�C and washed 2 times
with the provided wash buffer. 25 mL of detection antibodies were added to each well and the plate was covered with foil and incu-
bated with shaking for 1 hour at RT. 25 mL of Streptavidin-Phycoerythrin was then added to each well, covered with foil, and
incubated with shaking for 30 minutes. The plate was then washed 2 times and 150 mL of the provided drive fluid was added to
each well followed by 5 minutes of shaking. The plate was run and read on MAGPIX� machine with xPonenent� Software (EMD
Millipore Corporation, Billerica, MA, USA). The data were analyzed using Xponent� software. Briefly, the software analyzed median
fluorescent intensity data using 5-parameter logistic or spline curve-fitting method for calculating each cytokine concentration in
samples. Data are presented as ng/mg protein.
BDNF enzymatic activity assay
The BDNF ImmunoAssay Elisa was performed per manufacturer’s instructions (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI, USA).
Flat-bottom 96-well plates were coated with Anti-BDNF Monoclonal Antibody overnight at 4�C to bind soluble antibody. After the
addition of 25 mL of each standard or lysate, the plate was incubated for 2 hours and secondary antibody was added. The plate
was washed 3 times with TBS-T and the amount of bound pAb was detected using an anti-IgY horseradish peroxidase antibody.
Unbound conjugate was removed by washing 5 times with TBST, a chomogenic substrate was added, and color was measured
on a spectrometer at a wavelength of 450nm. Data are presented as mg BDNF/mg protein.
Golgi Staining
A rapid Golgi Stain was performed per manufacturer’s instructions (FD Neurotechnologies, Inc, Columbia, MD, USA). Brains were
removed and rinsed with ice-cold double deionized water. The complete right section was submerged in an impregnation solution
consisting of equal parts of solution ‘A’ and solution ‘B’. Samples were stored at room temperature in the dark for 2 weeks and then
moved to solution ‘C’ for 3 days. They were then cut on the midsagittal plane with a vibratome at 100 mm to visualize and quantify
dendritic spines (Zaqout and Kaindl, 2016). Samples were left to dry before the staining protocol. Sections were rinsed in distilled

e4
 water before placing into a mixture consisting of 1 part solution ‘D’ and 1 part solution ‘E’. After an additional rinse, sections were
dehydrated in increasing 50%, 75%, and 95% ethanol solutions before clearing in xylene and coverslipping in DPX mounting media
for histology (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA).
Dendritic spine quantification
Slides were imaged on an Olympus VS-120 Slide Scanner at 40X magnification which gave good resolution for spine counting pur-
poses (Orlowski and Bjarkam, 2012). 25 z-slices of 1 mm each were imaged from each hippocampus. Dendritic spines were quantified
using NeuronStudio software (Mount Sanai School of Medicine, available at http://research.mssm.edu/cnic/tools-ns.html) and
blindly counted (DW). It has been demonstrated that the manual counting method by an investigator does not produce significantly
different results when compared to other software or semi-automatic counting methods (Orlowski and Bjarkam, 2012). Spines were
quantified in the dentate gyrus of each hippocampus and secondary and tertiary branches of each neuron were analyzed. A total of
8 - 12 segments were quantified from each hippocampus depending on the quality of the stain. The quantified dendritic branch seg-
ments were required to have the characteristics as previously described (Jacobs et al., 2014): (1) completely and darkly stained near
the center of the 100 mm section, (2) contain no broken sections with complete spines, and (3) isolated without interference or overlap
from other structures. Data are presented at the number of spines per 10 microns (Stranahan et al., 2009).
Immunofluorescence
Brains were carefully removed and cut on a midsagittal plane. The left side was placed in 4% formalin for 24 hours followed by 30%
sucrose cryoprotection for 24 hours at 4�C. Brains were embedded in OCT (Siltera-Finetele, Inc, USA, Torrance, CA) before slowly
freezing on dry ice and storing at �80�C until further use. They were sliced at 30 mm on a midsagittal plane on a cryostat. 5 sections
were taken from each brain and mounted on slides. For Iba1 staining, sections were post-fixed with 4% PFA before quenching with
50 mM NH4CL. For antigen retrieval, a commercially available Proteinase K solution was used for three minutes (Sigma Aldrich,
St. Louis, MO, USA) and tissue was blocked for 30 minutes with 10% goat serum in PBS. Slides were incubated with primary anti-
bodies Iba1 (1:250; GeneTex Irvine, CA, USA) overnight at 4�C. Sections were thoroughly washed and incubated with the fluorescent
secondary antibody (1:1000, Cyanine 3, ThermoFisher Scientific) for 1 hour before washing and coverslipping with vectashield
mounting media containing DAPI (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA). For GFAP, slides were washed with PBST before
blocking for 30 minutes in 3% goat serum in PBS. Slides were placed into primary antibody (1:2000, abcam, United States) diluted
in 3% goat serum in PBS. Slides were incubated overnight at 4 degrees followed by washing with PBST and a 1 hour incubation in
secondary antibody (1:1000; Cyanine3, ThermoFisher Scientific) for one hour. Slides were imaged on a on an Olympus VS-120 Slide
Scanner at 20X magnification (Iba1) or a Leica confocal microscope with white light laser (WLL), coupled with a 20X HC PL APO CS2
NA 0.75 lens (GFAP). Images were quantified using ImageJ. Data are presented as the number of Iba1+ cells per 1mm2 in the hip-
pocampus or the mean corrected total hippocampus fluorescence (GFAP).
Behavioral testing
Animals were handled extensively before and during the testing phase to acclimatize them to human interaction and minimize po-
tential anxiety caused by interference. Mice received a minimum 2-hours of room habituation before commencing each test. Animals
were tested in random order during each testing period and equipment was thoroughly cleaned with 80% ethanol between trials to
minimize scents. To test memory during aging animal performance was assessed on both the Novel Object Recognition and Barnes
Maze memory tasks. The same animals were tested at young and old age in a longitudinal manner, similar to human dementia and
memory studies (Tian et al., 2017). The two-time points were 13 months of age (young) and 23 months of age (old). Animals received a
minimum 3 days rest in between the two tests. Male and female results were analyzed separately because of innate behavioral and
response differences between sexes (Simpson and Kelly, 2012).
Novel Object Recognition (NOR)
The NOR task was performed in a custom made white opaque plexiglass box (40cmx40cmx40cm; City West Plastic, Sydney, NSW).
The task was performed as previously described (Bevins and Besheer, 2006) with an inter-trial interval of 24 hours. On day 1, mice
were placed into the box and allowed to explore (habituation period) for 5 minutes followed by one hour of rest before the first trial.
Two identical non-toxic and odourless objects (cell culture flasks filled with sand) were placed into the box (5cm from each wall)
and the mice could explore for 5 minutes. After an inter-trial interval of 24 hours the mice were placed back into the box but one
of the old objects was replaced with a new one (tower of Legos blocks) of similar shape, size, and height. The trial ended once a total
exploration time of 20 s was reached, or 5 minutes elapsed. A recognition index (RI) was calculated as the time the mouse spent
exploring the new object over total object exploration time. Mice were excluded from the analysis if they did not reach the 5-minute
exploration criteria. All trials were recorded with an AnyMaze USB camera at 30 frames per second and quantified with a stopwatch
by two independent and skilled reviewers.
Barnes Maze (BM)
The Barnes maze task was performed as previously described (Sunyer et al., 2007). An opaque plastic maze was constructed
(100 cm in diameter; City West Plastics, Sydney, NSW) with 20 equally-spaced concentric holes around the perimeter. A black
e5

 escape box was placed in a random location under one of the holes. Distinct spatial cues (large cut-outs of black shapes – a circle,
square, and triangle) were placed on walls around the room and the location of the cues remained constant throughout the testing
period. Training on day one consisted of gently guiding the mouse to the escape box and covering it in the dark for one minute.
Testing consisted of 4 trials (3 minutes maximum) per day, per mouse, for 4 days in a row. If the mouse could not find the hole after
three minutes, it was gently guided there. After each trial completion, the hole was covered in the dark for one minute. All videos were
recorded with an AnyMaze USB camera at 30 frames/second and data were analyzed using AnyMaze (Stoelting, Wood Dale, IL, USA)
and GraphPad Prism 7. Data are represented as the mean ± SEM in seconds taken to completely enter the escape box from the start
of the trial.
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Statistical parameters, significance, and the exact n (number of animals) values are reported in the figure legends. Metabolic mea-
sures, immunoblotting, and behavioral data were separated by sex. Male and female mice were combined for biological replicates
in the other analyses because there were no statistically significant differences between sexes. Data were analyzed with Excel,
R-studio, and GraphPad Prism 7 (La Jolla, CA, USA). The BM data were analyzed using 2 - way ANOVA (treatment x trial time)
with repeated-measures (day) and an ANOVA was used to calculate differences among the groups on individual days. All other
data were analyzed by an analysis of variance (ANOVA) with diet treatment as a factor for parametric data followed by a Tukey mul-
tiple comparison test with a single pooled variance. For non-parametric data, a Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA was used followed by a
Dunn’s post hoc multiple comparison test. Linear regression was used to determine relationships between variables and a Pearson’s
correlation was used to calculate statistically significant relationships. Data are represented as means ± SEM and p values of less
than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
