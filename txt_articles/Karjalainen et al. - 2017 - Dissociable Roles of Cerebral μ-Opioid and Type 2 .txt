Abstract
Neuroimaging studies have shown that seeing others in pain activates brain regions that are involved in first-hand pain,
suggesting that shared neuromolecular pathways support processing of first-hand and vicarious pain. We tested whether
the dopamine and opioid neurotransmitter systems involved in nociceptive processing also contribute to vicarious pain
experience. We used in vivo positron emission tomography to quantify type 2 dopamine and μ-opioid receptor (D2R and
MOR, respectively) availabilities in brains of 35 subjects. During functional magnetic resonance imaging, the subjects
watched short movie clips depicting persons in painful and painless situations. Painful scenes activated pain-responsive
brain regions including anterior insulae, thalamus and secondary somatosensory cortices, as well as posterior superior
temporal sulci. MOR availability correlated negatively with the haemodynamic responses during painful scenes in anterior
and posterior insulae, thalamus, secondary and primary somatosensory cortices, primary motor cortex, and superior
temporal sulci. MOR availability correlated positively with orbitofrontal haemodynamic responses during painful scenes.
D2R availability was not correlated with the haemodynamic responses in any brain region. These results suggest that the
opioid system contributes to neural processing of vicarious pain, and that interindividual differences in opioidergic system
could explain why some individuals react more strongly than others to seeing pain.

Introduction
Capacity for vicarious experiences is a fundamental aspect of
human social behavior. For example, seeing others in pain
often triggers in the observer strong unpleasant sensations
resembling first-hand pain. Neuroimaging studies have estab-
lished that some of the brain circuits involved in nociceptive

 processing are also engaged during vicarious pain (Singer et al.
2004, 2006; Jackson et al. 2005, 2006; Lamm et al. 2011) (but see
also Krishnan et al. 2016). Both experiences are typically associ-
ated with activation of brain regions that are related to the
affective component of pain, namely anterior cingulate cortex
(ACC) and anterior insulae (Rainville et al. 1997; Price 2000;
Lamm et al. 2011), and sometimes also somatosensory cortices
related to the sensory dimension of pain (Singer et al. 2004).
Moreover, haemodynamic activity in anterior insulae and ACC
correlate with the observer’s empathic concerns (Singer et al.
2004; Saarela et al. 2007), whereas activity in the somatosensory
regions may relate to vicarious simulation of the intensity of
observed pain (Bufalari et al. 2007). Such vicarious simulation of
others’ emotional and bodily states presumably mimics the neg-
ative emotional experience associated with pain, which may
promote understanding others’ painful feelings and facilitate
helping behavior (Hein et al. 2010).
The similarities of haemodynamic activity during first-hand
and vicarious pain experiences suggest that their neurochemi-
cal bases might also be similar. Endogenous opioid system and
especially the μ-opioid receptor (MOR) is intimately involved in
the modulation of emotions (Nummenmaa and Tuominen
2017) and pain (Heinricher and Fields 2013). Human positron
emission tomography (PET) studies have shown that noxious
stimuli activate the MOR system, most consistently in ventral
striatum, thalamus, and amygdala (Zubieta et al. 2001, 2002,
2003; Bencherif et al. 2002; Smith et al. 2006; Scott et al. 2007,
2008; Wager et al. 2007). Furthermore, the magnitude of MOR
activation in thalamus and dorsal ACC (dACC) correlates with
negative emotional experiences associated with pain (Zubieta
et al. 2001), suggesting that differences in opioidergic neurotrans-
mission in these regions may explain interindividual variation in
pain perception. The endogenous opioid system could also affect
how humans respond to seeing others in pain. Opioid antagonist
naltrexone increases pain ratings and unpleasant experiences
when seeing others in pain (Rütgen, Seidel, Silani et al. 2015).
Similarly, placebo analgesia that is supported by the opioid sys-
tem (Peciña and Zubieta 2015) reduces the negative emotional
experience of the observers, and this reduction is also reflected
as attenuated brain responses related to pain’s negative affect
(Rütgen, Seidel, Rieˇ
canský et al. 2015; Rütgen, Seidel, Silani
et al. 2015).
In addition to the opioid system, the endogenous dopamine
system and particularly the type 2 dopamine receptors (D2R)
are also involved in nociceptive processing. In rats, pharmaco-
logical facilitation of the striatal D2R system suppresses, and its
blockade increases, pain behavior (Lin et al. 1981; Magnusson
and Fisher 2000; Taylor et al. 2003). In humans, PET studies
have revealed enhanced dopaminergic processing in dorsal
striatum during first-hand pain (Scott et al. 2006, 2007, 2008;
Wood et al. 2007). Dopamine release in striatum correlates with
both sensory and affective components of pain (Scott et al.
2006; Martikainen et al. 2015), and striatal D2R availability cor-
relates negatively with pain sensitivity (Hagelberg et al. 2002;
Pertovaara et al. 2004; Martikainen et al. 2005; Scott et al. 2006).
Despite its well-established role in nociceptive processing, the
role of the D2R system in vicarious pain remains unexplored.
In sum, several lines of evidence suggest functional similarities
between brain mechanisms underlying first-hand and vicarious
pain. Even though both MOR and D2R are involved in first-hand
pain, it remains unresolved whether they also support vicarious
pain. Here we tested this hypothesis using multimodal neuro-
imaging. We used PET with radioligands selective for MOR
([11C]carfentanil) and D2R ([11C]raclopride) to estimate neurore-
ceptor availability in vivo. Subsequently, the subjects under-
went functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), during
which they watched videos of humans experiencing varying
levels of pain. We found that seeing others in pain activates
several brain regions involved in nociception, including second-
ary somatosensory cortices (S2), thalamus and anterior insulae,
as well as prefrontal cortices (PFC) and superior temporal sulci
(STS). Critically, baseline cerebral MOR availability was nega-
tively correlated with haemodynamic responses to others’ pain
in sensorimotor regions, anterior insulae, and STS. Positive cor-
relations were found in orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). In contrast,
we found no connection between D2R receptor availability and
brain responses to others’ pain. Our data suggest that MORs, but
not D2Rs, contribute significantly to vicarious pain.
Materials and Methods
Participants
The study protocol was approved by the ethics board of the
Hospital District of Southwest Finland, and the study was con-
ducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. We stud-
ied altogether 36 women (mean ± SD age: 44 ± 10 years, range:
19–58 years). One subject was removed from the sample because
her MRI revealed a previously nondiagnosed neurological dis-
ease. Exclusion criteria were lack of compliance, alcohol con-
sumption
exceeding
8
weekly
doses,
substance
abuse
determined by interview and blood tests, a history of or current
psychiatric or neurological disease, current medication affecting
the central nervous system, as well as standard PET and MRI
exclusion criteria. Each subject participated in 3 imaging ses-
sions. The 2 PET scans were separated, on average, by 4 days,
while the PET and MRI scans were separated, on average, by 3
weeks.
The
subjects
signed
ethics-committee-approved
informed consent forms, and they were compensated for their
time and travel costs.
PET Imaging and Analysis
Figure 1 shows an overview of the experimental design and
data analysis. PET data were acquired with the GE Healthcare
Discovery
TM
690
PET/CT
scanner
in
Turku
PET
Center.
Radiotracer production has been described previously (Karlsson
et al. 2015). After a bolus of intravenous radioligand injection
(251 ± 10 MBq of [11C]carfentanil and 251 ± 24 MBq of [11C]raclo-
pride), radioactivity in the brain was measured with PET for
51 minutes with increasing frame length (3 × 1 min, 4 × 3 min,
6 × 6 min) using in-plane resolution of 3.75 mm. The [11C]carfen-
tanil and [11C]raclopride PET scans were performed on separate
days. The subjects were lying in supine position throughout the
studies. Data were corrected for dead-time, decay and measured
photon-attenuation, and dynamic PET scans were reconstructed
with
vendor-provided
standard
MRAC
and
MRP
methods
(Alenius and Ruotsalainen 1997).
Anatomical MR images (1 mm3) were acquired with Philips
Gyroscan Intera 1.5 T scanner using T1-weighted sequences.
PET images were realigned frame-to-frame and coregistered
with the anatomical and functional MR images (see below).
Subject-specific regional time–activity curves (TACs) were then
calculated for each region of interest (ROI; see below). Medial
occipital cortex and cerebellum were used as reference regions
in [11C]carfentanil and [11C]raclopride analyses, respectively. To
ensure that the ROIs would not contain nondisplaceable binding,

 voxels whose signal did not exceed mean reference tissue signal
intensity were also excluded from the ROIs.
Simplified reference tissue model (SRTM; Lammertsma and
Hume 1996) was used to model the tracer kinetics. Tracer bind-
ing was expressed in terms of BPND, which is the ratio of spe-
cific
to
nondisplaceable
binding.
ROI-level
modeling
was
performed using an in-house implementation of SRTM. Voxel-
level fitting was done using the basis-functions implementa-
tion of SRTM (Gunn et al. 1997); the parameter bounds for θ3
(θ3

=
0.06/min,
θ3
max(carfentanil)

0.6/min;
θ3
min(raclopride) = 0.082/min, θ3
max(raclopride) = 0.6/min) were
chosen
so
that
averaging
over
voxel-level
BPND-estimates
within a ROI would produce the same result as first calculating
a ROI-specific TAC and then fitting the model to that.
ROI Selection
Tracer binding was quantified in 13 anatomical ROIs involved
in nociceptive and socioemotional processing (Singer et al.
2004; Lahnakoski et al. 2012; Karlsson et al. 2015): amygdala,
caudate, dACC, rostral ACC, thalamus, anterior insula, posterior
insula, posterior STS, putamen, nucleus accumbens, precentral
gyrus, postcentral gyrus, and OFC. The ROIs are visualized on
top of tracer-specific mean binding potential maps in Figure 2.
Specific [11C]raclopride binding is low in many of these regions;
we nevertheless included them in the analysis for the sake of
consistency. The ROIs were derived separately for each subject
using
FreeSurfer
(http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/);
such
ROIs yield consistent estimates with those delineated manually
(Johansson et al. 2016). Posterior STS was delineated manually
because FreeSurfer does not segment it, and because corre-
sponding anatomical ROI does not exist in atlases.
fMRI Data Acquisition and Analysis
Experimental Design and Stimuli
The experimental design has been previously described in
detail (Lahnakoski et al. 2012) and is summarized in Figure 1. In
brief, the stimuli consisted of 102 video clips (mean duration
12 s; to shorten the experiment we dropped 35 videos from the
original design) extracted from mainstream Hollywood movies.
The videos contained humans involved in painful and painless
situations, as well as filler scenes without humans (scenery,
inanimate objects, etc.). The clips were presented without
breaks in a fixed order, and the total duration of the experiment
was 21 minutes. During the fMRI scan, the participants were
asked not to move and watch the videos attentively as they
would be watching a movie or TV.
Dynamic ratings for the intensity of vicarious pain seen in
the videos were obtained in a separate condition from 17 parti-
cipants (10 females) not participating in the neuroimaging
study. Pearson correlation coefficient between mean male and
female ratings was 0.96, and consequently ratings from both
sexes were used in this study. While viewing each video clip,
the participants used a mouse to move a small cursor at the right
side of the screen up and down to indicate how much pain (from
“not at all” to “highest imaginable pain”) the character in the clip
was experiencing. Ratings were sampled at 5 Hz, averaged across
subjects, downsampled to one TR and finally convolved with the
canonical HRF to provide regressors for the general linear model
(GLM) analysis. The online rating tool is freely available at
https://version.aalto.fi/gitlab/eglerean/dynamicannotations.
To control for low-level sensory confounds, we computed
moment-to-moment mean luminosity and sound intensity
from the video and audio tracks in 200 ms time windows using
root mean square of the raw luminosity and sound intensity
Figure 1. Experimental design and overview of the PET–fMRI fusion analysis. (a) Subjects watched 102 short movie clips depicting humans in painful and painless
situations. (b) Dynamic pain ratings (mean ± SEM across subjects) for the stimulus array were obtained in a separate experiment. (c) The mean pain rating was first
used to predict subjectwise BOLD responses to seeing others in pain in the general linear model. Regional [11C]carfentanil and [11C]raclopride binding potentials were
then used to predict the voxelwise regressor coefficients between pain ratings and BOLD to evaluate the contribution of MOR and D2R on vicarious pain.

 for each time window. These time series were convolved with
HRF and further downsampled to one TR, orthogonalized with
respect to the vicarious pain regressor, and finally included in
the model as nuisance covariates (see below).
Image Acquisition and Analysis
Whole-brain functional data were acquired with T2*-weighted
echo-planar imaging sequence, sensitive to the blood-oxygen-
level-dependent (BOLD) signal contrast (TR = 3300 ms, TE =
50 ms, 90° flip angle, 192 mm FOV, 64 × 64 reconstruction
matrix, 62.5 kHz bandwidth, 4.0 mm slice thickness, 33 inter-
leaved
slices
acquired
in
ascending
order
without
gaps).
Altogether 390 functional volumes were acquired. Anatomical
images (1 mm3 resolution) were acquired using a T1-weighted
sequence (TR 25 ms, TE 4.6 ms, flip angle 30°, 280 mm FOV, 256 ×
256 reconstruction matrix).
Functional data were preprocessed with FSL using the FEAT
pipeline: slice-time correction, motion correction, 2-step core-
gistration to MNI 152 2-mm template, and 8-mm spatial
smoothing using Gaussian kernel. Low-frequency drifts in data
were estimated and removed using a 240-s-long Savitzky–Golay
filter (Çukur et al. 2013). To control for head-motion confounds,
motion parameters were regressed out (Friston et al. 1996).
GLM was fitted to the data using SPM12 (version 6225; http://
www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/). The design matrix consisted of 3
regressors: moment-to-moment ratings of i) seen pain in the
videos, ii) brightness of the video track, and iii) intensity of the
audio track. Subjectwise contrast images were generated for
main effect of vicarious pain intensity. The contrast images
were then subjected to a second-level analysis to reveal at the
population level brain regions processing vicarious pain. As it
has been recently argued that typical parametric statistical
inference methods may produce inflated false-positive rates in
neuroimaging (Eklund et al. 2016), we used nonparametric
inference as implemented in SnPM13 toolbox (http://warwick.
ac.uk/snpm).
PET–fMRI Fusion Analysis
To test for the contribution of MOR and D2R on vicarious pain, the
voxel-wise BOLD responses were modeled with ROI-wise [11C]car-
fentanil and [11C]raclopride binding potentials in each ROI sepa-
rately using linear regression analysis (Fig. 1). We also investigated
whether global MOR and D2R availabilities, calculated as the
within-subject mean binding potentials for both tracers (i.e., aver-
aged across the ROIs shown in Fig. 2), predict haemodynamic
responses during vicarious pain. In all analyses, 10 000 permuta-
tions were used to estimate the null distribution, primary threshold
was set to P = 0.05, and only the clusters surviving FWE-correction
(P < 0.05) are reported. In a complementary methodological
approach, we also extracted subjectwise BOLD responses to seeing
others in pain in the 13 ROIs described above. Subsequently, MOR
and D2R availabilities in these ROIs were correlated with the
regional BOLD responses to characterize the regional interactions

 between MOR, D2R, and BOLD responses while seeing others in
pain. This enabled visualizing in which regions binding potential
estimates best predicted the BOLD responses.
Results
Main Effect for Vicarious Pain
We first modeled the BOLD data with the vicarious pain inten-
sity regressor to reveal brain regions activated when seeing
others in pain. This analysis (Fig. 3) replicated our prior results
using the same protocol (Lahnakoski et al. 2012), revealing bilat-
eral activation clusters in regions including anterior insulae and
S2 that are related to both first-hand and vicarious experiences
of pain (Singer et al. 2004, 2006; Jackson et al. 2005, 2006; Hein
et al. 2010; Lamm et al. 2011; Morelli et al. 2014). Additional clus-
ters were observed in primary motor cortices, as well as in PFC
and STS that are linked to empathy and intention representation
in general (Nummenmaa and Calder 2009; Morishima et al. 2012;
Rameson et al. 2012). The unthresholded t-map is available at
http://neurovault.org/collections/BHAGGQLK/.
Fusion Analysis of PET and fMRI Data
We next tested how regional MOR and D2R availabilities influ-
ence BOLD responses to seeing others in pain. In the full-brain
GLM analyses, regional MOR availabilities in caudate, OFC, pos-
terior insula, postcentral gyrus, STS, putamen, and rostral ACC
were negatively correlated with the BOLD responses in thala-
mus, sensorimotor regions (S1, S2, M1, paracentral lobule,
SMA), anterior insulae, lateral PFC, and STS (Figs 4 and 5a; see
http://neurovault.org/collections/BHAGGQLK/ for the unthre-
sholded t-maps). Results using the global MOR availability
closely mirror these findings (Supplementary Fig. 1). These
effects overlapped most clearly with the main effect of vicari-
ous pain in anterior insula, somatosensory cortex, thalamus,
STS, and striatum (total overlap 28%; see Supplementary Fig. 2).
Positive correlations did not exceed the a priori statistical
threshold in any region. However, at more lenient thresholding
(P < 0.05 uncorrected, cluster size >1000) MOR availability in
thalamus was correlated with the BOLD responses in OFC
(Fig. 5b). While not found using the global MOR availability, this
effect was also detected in the a priori ROI analysis (see below).
Finally, D2R availability did not predict BOLD responses to see-
ing others in pain in any brain region, even when more lenient
statistical threshold (uncorrected P < 0.05, cluster size >3000)
was used.
These results were corroborated by the ROI-wise correlation
analyses (Fig. 6), which revealed that cerebral MOR availability
(particularly in caudate, putamen, and rostral ACC) correlates
negatively with BOLD responses (e.g., in postcentral gyrus,

In addition, cerebral MOR availability correlated positively with
the BOLD responses in OFC. This association pattern was
remarkably consistent across the ROIs in which [11C]carfentanil
BPND was estimated in (Fig. 6). Again, D2R availability was not
correlated with BOLD responses.
Discussion
Our results show that haemodynamic responses during vicari-
ous pain depended on cerebral MOR but not D2R availability in
regionally selective manner: MOR availability was negatively
correlated with BOLD responses in sensorimotor (S1, S2, M1,
paracentral lobule, SMA) regions as well as in parts of the emo-
tion circuit (insula, thalamus), whereas positive correlation was
found in OFC that is involved in multiple socioemotional func-
tions, such as mentalizing and social bonding (Powell et al.
2012; Schurz et al. 2014; Nummenmaa et al. 2015). These data
provide the first in vivo evidence about the neuromolecular
pathways involved in processing of vicarious pain, suggesting
that MORs but not D2Rs contribute to the vicarious experience.
Even though recent studies suggest that the functional (as mea-
sured with fMRI) neural bases of first-hand and vicarious pain
experiences differ (Krishnan et al. 2016), our study suggests
that they however rely on the same neurotransmitter system.
Opioidergic Basis of Vicarious Pain Experience
Intensity of seen pain in the videos correlated positively with
BOLD signals in thalamus, anterior insulae, S2, superior PFC, as
well as precuneus, occipital cortex and pSTS, thereby replicat-
ing our previous findings using the same experimental setup
(Lahnakoski et al. 2012). The results also accord with prior work
showing that these regions are consistently engaged during
vicarious pain (Singer et al. 2004; Jackson et al. 2005; Saarela
et al. 2007). Thalamus, insula, S2 and PFC are also activated by
noxious stimuli (Tracey and Mantyh 2007) and may underlie
the affective mirroring of pain. On the contrary, PFC and STS
are important regions linked to empathy and representing
others’ internal states in general (Morishima et al. 2012;
Rameson et al. 2012).
Our main new finding is the negative correlation between
cerebral MOR availability and BOLD responses to seeing others
in pain, observed in sensorimotor regions (S1, S2, M1, SMA,
paracentral lobule), anterior insula, posterior insula, PFC, and
STS. This pattern was consistent across the ROIs where MOR
availabilities were estimated, likely reflecting the widespread
spatial autocorrelation of MOR availability across the brain
(Tuominen et al. 2014). These results extend the similarities
between first-hand and vicarious pain to neuromolecular level
by showing that the endogenous opioid system—a key modula-
tor of nociceptive processing (Heinricher and Fields 2013)—also
affects vicarious pain.
Prior PET studies have linked lowered MOR availability, spe-
cifically in striatum and frontal cortex (subgenual ACC, ventro-
medial PFC), to heightened pain sensitivity (Hagelberg et al.
2012; Peciña et al. 2015). Our data show that low MOR availabil-
ity in these same regions (caudate, putamen, rostral ACC) is
also associated with heightened BOLD responses to seeing
others in pain. Importantly, prior studies have established that
an individual’s sensitivity to first-hand pain predicts their sen-
sitivity to vicarious pain (Danziger et al. 2006; Derbyshire et al.
2013). Similarly, pharmacological work has confirmed that pain
suppression
decreases
and
pain
facilitation
increases
the
negative emotional experiences associated with seeing others
in pain (Bos et al. 2015; Rütgen, Seidel, Rieˇ
canský et al. 2015;
Rütgen, Seidel, Silani et al. 2015; Mischkowski et al. 2016).
Altogether these observations suggest that individuals who
have low threshold to noxious stimuli tend to react strongly
also to others’ pain, and that endogenous opioid system pro-
vides a neuromolecular link between these two phenomena.
In contrast to the sensorimotor BOLD responses, the BOLD
responses in OFC were positively correlated with cerebral MOR
availability. OFC has an important role in mentalizing (Schurz
et al. 2014), and orbitofrontal cortical volume correlates with an
individual’s social network size (Powell et al. 2012). While not
directly linked to mentalizing, MORs have been associated with
various forms of prosocial behavior, including pair bonding and
sociability (Panksepp et al. 1980; Moles et al. 2004; Nummenmaa
et al. 2015; Karjalainen et al. 2016; Manninen et al. 2017). Thus,
future studies should dissociate whether orbitofrontal brain activ-
ity during pain observation reflects mentalizing, and whether
MORs regulate this function.
Haemodynamic responses during vicarious pain in the
regions processing the affective dimension of pain correlate
with the empathic concerns of the observer (Singer et al. 2004;
Saarela et al. 2007), while the somatosensory regions represent
the intensity of observed pain (Bufalari et al. 2007). The pres-
ently observed negative correlation between cerebral MOR
availability and BOLD responses in both systems thus suggests
that individuals with high baseline MOR availability may have
attenuated emotional responses to others’ pain, and in general
they may be less likely to catch others’ negative emotions.
Indeed, individuals with high cerebral MOR availability have
reduced regional cerebral blood flow in the temporal pole dur-
ing negative emotions (Liberzon et al. 2002). Furthermore,
opioidergic neurotransmission in dACC, thalamus, and basal
ganglia reduces the negative emotional experience associated
with first-hand pain (Zubieta et al. 2001). Together with the
present data, these observations indicate that high cerebral
MOR availability may constitute a resiliency factor that protects
individuals from excessive personal distress triggered by nega-
tive social signals, such as witnessing others in pain. Future
studies could test whether individuals with high cerebral MOR
availability are less concerned about others’ distress, and
whether they would be less willing to engage in helping others
—a property shown to correlate with activation of the anterior
insula (Hein et al. 2010).
No Evidence for D2R Involvement in Vicarious Pain
In contrast to the MOR, we found no correlation between D2R
availability and BOLD responses to seeing others in pain.
Abundant evidence shows that the D2Rs process nociceptive
signals (Scott et al. 2006, 2007, 2008) and striatal D2R availability
correlates positively with an individual’s sensitivity to sensory
pain (Hagelberg et al. 2002; Pertovaara et al. 2004; Martikainen
et al. 2005; Scott et al. 2006). However, our data suggest that
dopaminergic processing of first-hand pain may be decoupled
from vicarious pain. It is possible that the D2R activation does
not relieve subjective discomfort as effectively as does MOR
activation (Taylor et al. 2016) and therefore has weaker effects
on how individuals perceive others’ pain.
Limitations
The main limitation of the study is that we did not measure
BOLD responses to first-hand pain and could thus not directly

 compare the contributions of MOR and D2R systems on first-
hand versus vicarious pain. However, prior studies have consis-
tently shown that MOR availability reliably predicts sensitivity to
noxious stimuli (Hagelberg et al. 2012; Peciña et al. 2015).
Another limitation is that we only scanned females and our
results thus may not generalize to males. Our subject selection
was, however, designed to maximize statistical power: first,
because the spatial distribution of MOR availability is different
in females and males (Gabilondo et al. 1995; Zubieta et al. 1999,
2002), it was better to include subjects of one sex only. Second,
females report higher pain ratings to others’ pain (Robinson and
Wise 2003) and experience and portray stronger emotions and
emotional mimicry than males (Grossman and Wood 1993), pre-
dicting stronger brain responses, in general, during painful situa-
tions. We also note that the fMRI and PET data were acquired on
average 3 weeks apart. However, the short-term test–retest reli-
ability is known to be excellent for [11C]carfentanil scans
(Hirvonen et al. 2009), and [11C]raclopride estimates are consis-
tent even with multiple-month-intervals (Nordström et al. 1992;
Hietala et al. 1999). Thus, the temporal gap between PET and
fMRI scans is unlikely a significant confound in the present
study.
Conclusions
Our data provide the first in vivo evidence for opioidergic con-
tribution to vicarious pain. Baseline MOR availability correlated
negatively with haemodynamic responses to seeing others in
pain in regions supporting negative affect of pain and sensori-
motor mirroring of others’ pain. On the contrary, MOR availabil-
ity was positively correlated with orbitofrontal haemodynamic
activity, possibly reflecting the region’s role in mentalizing and
socioemotional functions. Despite its well-established role in
nociceptive processing, the D2R system was not associated
with vicarious pain. We propose that high MOR availability
may protect against excessive distress resulting from negative
social signals, and that variation in endogenous opioid system
may explain why some individuals react more strongly than
others to seeing pain.
