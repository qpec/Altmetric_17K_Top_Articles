Scaling up prevention and treatment towards the 
elimination of hepatitis C: a global mathematical model
Alastair Heffernan, Graham S Cooke, Shevanthi Nayagam, Mark Thursz, Timothy B Hallett
Summary
Background The revolution in hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment through the development of direct-acting antivirals 
(DAAs) has generated international interest in the global elimination of the disease as a public health threat. In 2017, 
this led WHO to establish elimination targets for 2030. We evaluated the impact of public health interventions on the 
global HCV epidemic and investigated whether WHO’s elimination targets could be met.
Methods We developed a dynamic transmission model of the global HCV epidemic, calibrated to 190 countries, which 
incorporates data on demography, people who inject drugs (PWID), current coverage of treatment and prevention 
programmes, natural history of the disease, HCV prevalence, and HCV-attributable mortality. We estimated the 
worldwide impact of scaling up interventions that reduce risk of transmission, improve access to treatment, and 
increase screening for HCV infection by considering six scenarios: no change made to existing levels of diagnosis or 
treatment; sequentially adding the following interventions: blood safety and infection control, PWID harm reduction, 
offering of DAAs at diagnosis, and outreach screening to increase the number diagnosed; and a scenario in which 
DAAs are not introduced (ie, treatment is only with pegylated interferon and oral ribavirin) to investigate the effect of 
DAA use. We explored the effect of varying the coverage or impact of these interventions in sensitivity analyses and 
also assessed the impact on the global epidemic of removing certain key countries from the package of interventions.
Findings By 2030, interventions that reduce risk of transmission in the non-PWID population by 80% and increase 
coverage of harm reduction services to 40% of PWID could avert 14·1 million (95% credible interval 13·0–15·2) new 
infections. Offering DAAs at time of diagnosis in all countries could prevent 640 000 deaths (620 000–670 000) from 
cirrhosis and liver cancer. A comprehensive package of prevention, screening, and treatment interventions could avert 
15·1 million (13·8–16·1) new infections and 1·5 million (1·4–1·6) cirrhosis and liver cancer deaths, corresponding to an 
81% (78–82) reduction in incidence and a 61% (60–62) reduction in mortality compared with 2015 baseline. This reaches 
the WHO HCV incidence reduction target of 80% but is just short of the mortality reduction target of 65%, which could 
be reached by 2032. Reducing global burden depends upon success of prevention interventions, implemention of 
outreach screening, and progress made in key high-burden countries including China, India, and Pakistan.
Interpretation Further improvements in blood safety and infection control, expansion or creation of PWID harm 
reduction services, and extensive screening for HCV with concomitant treatment for all are necessary to reduce the 
burden of HCV. These findings should inform the ongoing global action to eliminate the HCV epidemic.

Introduction
Globally, it is estimated that 71·1 million (95% uncertainty 
interval 62·5–79·4) individuals are chronically infected 
with hepatitis C virus (HCV),1 of whom 10–20% will 
develop liver complications including decompensated 
cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.2,3 These compli­
cations were responsible for more than 475 000 deaths in 
2015 and, in contrast with the malaria, tuberculosis, and 
HIV epidemics, the number of deaths from viral hepatitis 
infection has risen in recent years.1,4 HCV transmission 
is most commonly associated with blood transfusions, 
health­care­related injections, and injection drug use.5 
Transfusion transmissible infections and infections 
associated with lapses in injection safety have declined 
globally,6,7 although these remain key risk factors in 
lower­income countries.8 Infection associated with 
injection drug use is the primary transmission route in 
countries where other transmission routes have mostly 
been eliminated.8,9 Treatment for HCV infection used to 
comprise weekly subcutaneous injections of pegylated 
interferon and oral ribavirin,10 which had low success 
rates and was associated with a range of side­effects.11,12 
A watershed moment came in 2014 with the development 
of highly efficacious direct­acting antivirals (DAAs),13,14 
which allow interferon­free treatment, greatly improved 
cure rates, better side­effect profiles, and shorter duration 
of therapy more amenable to widespread use.15,16
Advances in HCV therapeutics have led to a com­
mitment from all 194 member states of WHO to 
eliminate viral hepatitis as a public health threat.1,17 WHO 
HCV elimination targets are defined as a 65% reduction 
in mortality and an 80% reduction in incidence by 2030

from 2015 baseline (the HCV incidence reduction target 
combines with a 95% reduction target for viral 
hepatitis B incidence to produce the overall viral 
hepatitis incidence reduction target of 90%).17 This is to 
be achieved through a combination of preventing trans­
mission by improving blood safety and infection control 
measures, extending harm reduction services aimed at 
reducing transmission among people who inject drugs 
(PWID), and expanding testing and DAA treatment for 
those already infected.1
Although these targets were formulated by WHO 
through extensive consultations,17 the feasibility of 
achieving WHO targets globally is not known. Given the 
current focus on these targets, it is imperative we 
understand the full effect of HCV interventions at the 
global scale. We sought, therefore, to use mathematical 
modelling to provide the first estimates of the impact of 
combined prevention, diagnosis, and treatment pro­
grammes on the global HCV epidemic and to determine 
the achievability of WHO elimination targets.
Methods
Model structure
We developed a mathematical model to project the future 
course of the HCV epidemic country by country. We 
analysed the impact of a set of intervention packages at 
the global scale by combining the results for 190 individual 
countries. Our compartmental model simulates the pop­
ulation of a country from 1950 to 2100, grouped according 
to infection and treatment status (see the treatment 
cascade in figure 1). Compartments are further stratified 
by age, sex, and risk group (PWID and non­PWID). 
Infection (the transition from susceptible to acute com­
partments) is specified ac 
cording to HCV prevalence and 
a risk group­dependent, age­dependent, and time­
dependent risk of transmission that is calibrated in model 
fitting; perinatal infection can also occur. Background 
age­specific, sex­specific, and time­specific mortality is 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
In 2017, WHO set targets to eliminate hepatitis C virus (HCV) 
infection globally as a public health threat. We searched 
PubMed on Feb 23, 2018, for studies published in English that 
modelled the epidemiological impact of HCV interventions or 
modelled the global HCV epidemic, using the following search 
strategy: “(hepatitis C AND model* AND (global OR 
intervention*))”. We found 33 relevant studies. Mathematical 
models have been developed to investigate the effectiveness of 
harm reduction strategies in high-risk groups but these have 
not examined impact at the population level. Models of the 
population impact of screening and treatment have been 
developed and used to investigate WHO mortality targets at 
both the national and regional levels. These studies, however, 
could not investigate incidence targets because they did not 
utilise dynamic transmission models that would allow the 
impact of prevention interventions and the effect of treatment 
on incidence to be captured. A recent study used a dynamic 
transmission model to estimate the population-level impact of 
both prevention and treatment interventions in Pakistan. 
This work found that only with extremely high coverage of 
interventions can elimination targets be met. No study has 
modelled HCV interventions at the global scale.
Added value of this study
To our knowledge, our study is the first to estimate the impact 
of interventions on the global HCV epidemic and to address 
WHO HCV elimination targets. We explicitly model the 
transmission process within and between population groups, 
allowing us to model prevention as well as screening and 
treatment interventions. The model is calibrated to all global 
epidemiological and programme data in a statistically 
principled way. We quantify the extent to which prevention, 
screening, and treatment could reduce the burden of HCV 
globally. Our results highlight the key role prevention has in 
reducing the burden of disease, the bottleneck screening places 
on the impact of HCV interventions, and the importance of 
expanding access to direct-acting antivirals.
Implications of all the available evidence
Across the globe, coverage of key prevention, screening, and 
treatment interventions is currently well below the levels we 
estimate are needed to have a major impact on the HCV 
epidemic. Operations research into how to improve coverage 
in all settings, as well as increased funding for effective 
strategies, will be required to make progress towards HCV 
elimination targets.
Figure 1: Model structure
Boxes represent compartments of the model and arrows denote annual transition rates that can depend upon 
age, sex, risk group, or duration of infection that can vary over time. At any given point, every person is in 
one compartment of the cascade of care (A). These compartments are further subdivided by age, sex, and risk 
group. Spontaneous clearance occurs in a fraction of those acutely infected who return to the susceptible 
population. Treatment can result in cure and reinfection can occur after successful treatment. Infection results in 
people entering the natural history model (B): HCV disease progresses through five METAVIR18 fibrosis stages, 
from F0 (no fibrosis) to F4 (compensated cirrhosis). The potential effects of age and male sex on progression and 
mortality rates are accounted for in calibration. People in the cured compartment of the treatment cascade have 
reduced or zero disease progression rates depending on disease stage. See appendix for full details, including a 
list of parameter values with dependencies and the complete model structure diagram. HCV=hepatitis C virus.

PWID 
experience an additional mortality risk compared with 
other groups.20,21 HCV infection results in additional risk 
of liver­related mortality (denoted HCV­related mortality); 
increased non­liver­related mortality in those infected 
with HCV is not simulated because it is a much 
less substantial cause of death in HCV­positive individuals 
than is liver­related mortality22,23 and WHO viral hepatitis 
targets focus on liver­related mortality.24 It should be 
noted that neglecting non­liver­related mortality will tend 
to underestimate the impact of interventions.25,26
Past treatment and diagnosis is modelled as follows: we 
increase rates of diagnosis and treatment such that the 
proportion who are diagnosed, and the proportion treated, 
match WHO estimates for these quantities in 2015.1 DAAs 
are implemented from 2016 in countries where their use is 
reported.27,28 In these countries, the rate of treatment is 
calculated in the model such that the reported number of 
DAA treatment courses is matched by the model.27,28 All 
other countries continue to implement treatment with 
pegylated interferon and ribavirin after 2015. This approach 
results in 1·76 million HCV treatment courses being 
delivered in 2016, of which 86% consist of DAAs.28 After 
2016 (or 2015 for countries without 2016 data), the future 
rates of both diagnosis and treatment are fixed unless 
altered through an intervention. Treatment success 
depends on the type of treatment used (ie, pegylated 
interferon and ribavirin or DAAs). Reinfection following 
cure is also simulated: as a conservative assumption, 
reinfection risk is set to be equal to primary infection risk.29
Following infection with HCV, disease progression 
occurs according to a widely recognised natural history 
(figure 
1B).2,30,31 
Progression 
occurs 
through 
the 
five METAVIR18 fibrosis stages. Increased HCV­related 
mortality occurs from compensated cirrhosis (stage F4), 
decompensated cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. 
Disease prog 
ression and mortality rates are reduced (to 
zero, in some cases) following cure. All parameters in the 
natural history model are taken from the literature 
(appendix); where values are uncertain, parameters are 
drawn from prior distributions informed by the literature.
Model calibration
All uncertain parameters were allowed to vary in 
calibration. These parameters include those of the 
natural history model and the risk group­dependent, age­
dependent, and time­dependent risks of infection. These 
risks of infection are modelled as flexible splines, where 
the knot values are drawn from suitable prior dis­
tributions; for full details of the modelling of trans­
mission and a complete list of parameter values and 
prior distributions, see the appendix.
We calibrated the model, in a Bayesian framework, to 
three sets of information: overall HCV prevalence,1,32 
PWID HCV prevalence,33 and HCV­attributable mortality 
(according to age, time, and sex).4,34 1000 samples were 
drawn from the parameter posterior distributions using 
incremental mixture importance sampling.35 This self­
monitoring approach to approximating the posterior 
distribution proceeds by calculating the importance 
weight for a given parameter set and then drawing new 
parameter values until the expected fraction of unique 
parameter sets in the final resample corresponds to the 
case where all parameter weights are equal—ie, such that 
no one parameter set dominates the resampled values 
(appendix).35 The parameter sets drawn from the posterior 
distribution were used to make forward projections of the 
epidemic under a range of intervention scenarios.
Intervention scenarios
Six scenarios were constructed to assess the impact of 
differing levels of prevention, screening, and treatment 
intervention scale­up (table). The status quo scenario, 
which represents our best estimate of what the HCV 
epidemic will look like with no changes made to diagnosis 
or treatment, maintains diagnosis and treatment rates at 
their 2016 (or 2015 where 2016 data were not available) 
values and assumes no reduction in general or PWID 
population risk. We inferred diagnosis and treatment 
rates by scaling up these quantities to match the pro­
portion diagnosed or treated where data were available,40–43 
or using regional averages where data were lacking, with 
DAAs introduced in relevant countries in 2016 
(appendix);28 at the global scale, this results in 20% of 
people diagnosed in 2015, of whom 7% are treated.1
Four intervention strategies were sequentially added to 
the status quo scenario, starting in 2017: (1) blood safety 
and infection control, leading to an 80% reduction 
in HCV infection risk in the non­PWID population by 
2020; (2) PWID harm reduction, whereby 40%38 of the 
PWID population are reached with a combined package 
of opioid substitution therapy (OST) and needle and 
syringe programmes (NSP), leading to a 75% reduction in 
infection risk in those covered;36,37 (3) offering DAAs at 
diagnosis (regardless of disease stage), with status quo 
rates of diagnosis maintained (90% accept treatment); 
and (4) outreach screening, resulting in 90% of the HCV­
infected population being diagnosed by 2030 (table). Each 
intervention builds in the features of the previous 
strategies; intervention 4 comprises all interventions and 
is referred to as the comprehensive intervention package.
Finally, a no­DAA scenario, which is equivalent to 
status quo but incorporates only treatment with pegylated 
interferon and ribavirin, was included to analyse the 
scope of the epidemic if the recent adoption44 of DAA 
treatment is not maintained.
Sensitivity analysis
Uncertainty in the natural history model is accounted for 
in calibration by drawing 1000 samples from the parameter 
posterior distributions. The model is run 1000 times with 
these parameter sets and medians and credible intervals 
(CrIs; 2·5th and 97·5th percentiles) for all quantities of 
interest are evaluated. The effects of other notable model

assumptions (ie, reinfection rate, effectiveness of PWID 
harm reduction interventions, and delay in possible 
retreatment after reinfection) are investigated through 
one­way sensitivity analyses (appendix). We investigated 
the sensitivity of the outcomes in the comprehensive 
package of interventions by doing one­way sensitivity 
analyses on the three key intervention parameters: risk 
reduction in the non­PWID population, coverage of harm 
reduction in the PWID population, and proportion 
diagnosed by 2030. For each of these parameters, we 
explored the range from no improvement to 95% (the 
upper limit is chosen to represent a highly ambitious 
increase).45 We did another set of sensitivity analyses in 
the same manner as this but using the status quo as our 
starting point (as opposed to the comprehensive package 
of interventions) to explore the effects of each programme 
element. Finally, we evaluated which countries contributed 
most to infections and deaths averted under the 
comprehensive package of interventions and then re­ran 
the model without these countries included in the 
intervention package, with all values set to the status quo 
scenario, to quantify the sensitivity of our global results to 
progress made in key countries.

Results
We found 69 million (95% CrI 67–71) active viraemic 
infections and 512 000 deaths (497 000–533 000) in 2015, 
with 277 incident infections (262–294) per 1 million 
people, in line with WHO estimates for that year 
(figure 2).1 The projected proportion of new infections 
expected in PWID between 2016 and 2030 was 29% 
(95% CrI 27–32) in our model, in keeping with WHO 
estimates in 2015 that 22% of new infections were in 
PWID.1 Projecting the epidemic forwards in the status 
quo scenario, we find that the number of active infections 
will slowly decrease to 58 million (54–62) by 2050 but 
could rise by the end of the century. Likewise, incidence 
would gradually decrease to 198 infections (179–218) per 
1 million people by 2060 but might increase thereafter. 
Mortality from HCV gradually decreases for more than 
three decades but can increase thereafter in line with the 
possible increasing numbers of active infections 
(figure 3). These results reflect our assumptions in the 
status quo scenario that risk of infection does not decrease 
in any group after 2015 and that numbers of PWID will 
not change. Not implementing DAAs at all results in 
worse outcomes than in the status quo scenario, with 
considerably higher mortality and incidence (figure 3).
Programmes aimed at curbing the spread of blood­
borne infections among the non­PWID population (inter­
vention 1) can dramatically reduce incidence (figure 3). 
Global improvements in blood safety and infection control 
(lowering the general population risk of HCV infection by 
80%) reduce the annual number of new infections in 2030 
by 58% (95% CrI 56–60) compared with the status quo 
scenario in the same year. Along with these improvements 
in blood and infection safety, extending OST and NSP 
harm reduction services to 40% of the opioid­dependent 
PWID population (intervention 2) will reduce the number 
of new infections in 2030 by a further 7 percentage points 
(figure 3). Taken together, these prevention interventions 
could avert 14·1 million (95% CrI 13·0–15·2) cumulative 
infections by 2030. Due to the long incubation period of

HCV infection, however, such reductions in incidence 
will not immediately translate into reductions in mortality: 
by 2030, the decrease in mortality will be small in either 
scenario (figure 3) and the combination of both inter­
ventions will only reduce mortality in 2050 by 18% (17–19).
Expanding access to DAAs, in addition to the prevention 
interventions, is projected to cut future mortality more 
substantially. Replacing pegylated inter 
feron and ribavirin 
with DAAs in all countries where they have not been 
rolled out, and offering these at time of diagnosis (inter­
vention 3), has substantial short­term impact: we estimate 
640 000 fewer deaths (95% CrI 620 000–670 000) from liver 
cancer and cirrhosis by 2030. However, compared with 
intervention 2, there is no additional effect on incidence 
(figure 3). This scenario illustrates that improvements in 
outcomes can be attained by ensuring access to DAAs 
without otherwise changing diagnosis or treatment 
programmes. However, such gains fall well short of WHO 
mortality targets (figure 3) and these programmes also 
offer only minimal prevention benefits.
Adding outreach screening (intervention 4), such that 
the proportion diagnosed reaches 90% by 2030, further 
reduces mortality and incidence (figure 3). This scenario 
incorporates all prevention, screening, and treatment 
elements of the previous strategies. With this compre­
hensive package of interventions, there would be a 
61% (95% CrI 60–62) reduction in mortality by 2030 
compared with the baseline 2015 value—corresponding 
to 1·5 million (95% CrI 1·4–1·6) deaths prevented. Our 
estimates show a treatment­as­prevention benefit: com­
pared with prevention interventions alone (inter 
vention 2), 
the comprehensive package of interventions averts an 
average of 950 000 additional infections by 2030, resulting 
in 15·1 million (13·8–16·1) new infections averted in total. 
Achieving such reductions requires a massive screening 
programme and demands a rapid increase in new 
treatment courses in the short term—namely, 51·8 million 
(50·5–53·3) courses of DAA treatment by 2030 (appendix). 
In the following 20 years, by contrast, the total number 
required is a much more modest 12·0 million (11·5–12·7) 
courses. The reduced treatment requirement after 2030 
indicates that rapid testing and treatment scale­up is a 
means to control the epidemic in the long term.
Interventions do not have a uniform impact across 
different countries; projections by country are presented 
in the appendix. Upon all countries rolling out DAAs and 
offering these at diagnosis (intervention 3), most countries 
in Africa, along with south Asia, east Asia, and southeast 
Asia, experience smaller reductions in mortality than do 
countries in other regions (appendix). This reflects the 
lower existing diagnosis coverage in these countries. The 
effect of prevention interventions on incidence is also 
dependent on local epidemiology. Certain countries, such 
as Egypt, Mongolia, and Pakistan, benefit greatly from

improvements in blood safety and infection control 
(intervention 1) because these reduce risk of infection in 
the entire population (appendix). Countries that have a 
large proportion of the HCV epidemic concentrated 
in PWID—eg, the USA, Australia, and Spain—show 
more improvement upon expansion of PWID harm 
reduction services (intervention 2; appendix). All countries 
experience reductions in both mortality and incidence 
upon implementation of the comprehensive package of 
interventions (appendix), reflecting the high impact a 
multifaceted approach to tackling the epidemic can have.
WHO mortality and incidence elimination targets are 
narrowly missed in 2030 with the comprehensive package 
of interventions: the WHO­defined mortality elimination 
target occurs in this model by 2032, whereas the incidence 
elimination target is met by 2030 (figure 3). The 
comprehensive package of interventions does, however, 
lead to a 61% (95% CrI 60–62) reduction in mortality in 
2030 compared with the status quo scenario (figure 3). 
The mortality elimination targets could be reached by 
2030 if the coverage of diagnosis were increased to 
95% rather than the 90% assumed above (appendix).

Further incidence reduction is possible, but this is 
primarily achieved by increasing PWID harm reduction 
coverage: if coverage is increased to more than 80%, 
incidence rates can be reduced by nearly 90% compared 
with 2015 baseline values (appendix).
We also examined year of elimination by Global Burden 
of Disease Study (GBD) regions. All regions reach the 
mortality elimination target at similar times after imple­
menting the comprehensive package of interventions 
(figure 3). Although global incidence targets are met, 
eight regions do not reach the incidence elimination target 
before 2100. A key deter 
minant of whether incidence 
elimination is achieved is the proportion of infections by 
risk group: the regions that reach incidence elimination 
before 2030 are characterised by low numbers of infections 
in PWID relative to the rest of the population (appendix).
Reducing the global burden of hepatitis C depends on 
the progress made in just a few countries. Most infections 
and deaths averted, after implementation of the compre­
hensive package of interventions, are concentrated in a 
small number of countries, in particular China, India, 
Pakistan, and Egypt, which are the countries that 
contribute most to projected new infections by 2030 
(figure 4). If China, India, or Pakistan do not implement 
the comprehensive package of interventions, the year in 
which global incidence elimination is reached is pushed 
back to at least 2047 (appendix), whereas not implementing 
the comprehensive package of interventions in these 
countries would result in global incidence reductions 
in 2030 of 69% (95% CrI 66–74), as opposed to an 
81% (78–82) reduction when all countries implement the 
interventions (appendix).
We found that improving blood safety and infection 
control alone (ie, starting from the status quo scenario), 
such that the risk of infection in the general population 
decreases by 95%, can reduce incidence in 2030 by 72% 
(95% CrI 70–73; figure 5). Although HCV­positive PWID 
comprise only a minority of global HCV­positive indi­
viduals, programmes that can reduce PWID trans 
mission 
have a global impact upon incidence: expanding PWID

harm reduction coverage to 95% (in the absence of any 
other intervention scale­up) could reduce global incidence 
by 33% (31–36) in 2030 (figure 5). Screening and 
treatment interventions carry a double benefit: inc 
reasing 
the proportion diagnosed and treated (without scaling 
up the prevention interventions) reduces both mortality 
and incidence through a treatment­as­prevention effect 
(figure 5). Yet, treatment alone has less impact than when 
combined with prevention inter 
ventions: the compre­
hensive pack 
age of interventions reduces incidence in 
2030 by 81% (78–82) compared with 60% (57–62) when 
prevention interventions are not implemented.
Because the degree of effectiveness of PWID harm­
reduction programmes is more uncertain than that of 
DAA 
treatment, 
and 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
such 
programmes probably varies substantially between 
settings, we did sensitivity analyses to investigate the 
dependence of the results on this aspect of the model. 
Reducing the effectiveness of OST and NSP interventions 
from 75% to 20% (within the context of the comprehensive 
package of interventions, scenario 4) pushed back the 
year of incidence elimination to 2052 (appendix). As 
shown by the regional breakdown, this is driven by delays 
in elimination in regions in which HCV­positive PWID 
comprise a large proportion of the HCV epidemic (such 
as western Europe, high­income North America, and 
Australasia; appendix). By contrast, simulations in which 
PWID harm reduction effectiveness is taken to be 90% 
resulted in a median estimate of 470 000 fewer courses of 
treatment being delivered by 2030 in intervention 4 than 
when the effectiveness is assumed to be 75% (appendix).
Year of incidence elimination is sensitive to the extent 
of intervention scale­up (appendix). Reducing coverage of 
any intervention, within the context of the comprehensive 
package, predictably pushes elimination further into the 
future. However, the relationship between the level of 
diagnosis and impact on incidence (and year of achieving 
the elimination target) is found to be parabolic; that is, 
intermediate levels of diagnosis led to lesser reductions in 
incidence than either no increase or enormous increases 
in diagnosis rates. This is because we have assumed that 
cured people are at risk of reinfection and, at lower levels 
of diagnosis coverage, infection risk for PWID remains 
high and so there can be more infections than with no 
intervention. At high levels of diagnosis, this effect is 
overwhelmed by the reduction in infection risk that is 
brought about by the reduction in the numbers of 
infectious people. The risk of reinfection is, however, 
not known, and if it were lower than the risk of initial 
infection then the year of elimination could be sooner 
than we have estimated and thus the non­linear, parabolic 
effect described disappears (appendix). Further sensitivity 
analyses showed that the delay in accessing retreatment 
after reinfection had no impact on the results (appendix).
Discussion
A dramatic decrease in both mortality and incidence in 
HCV could be possible through implementation of a 
comprehensive package of prevention, screening, and 
treatment interventions. Even though it narrowly falls 
short of the WHO targets for 2030, such an impact would 
be a tremendous stride forwards, averting 15·1 million 
new infections and 1·5 million HCV­related deaths by 
2030.
Several important challenges must be met and this 
analysis raises points of direct relevance to policy and 
programme development. First, the benefits of DAAs will 
only be fully reaped with an exceptional increase in diag­
nosis coverage to 90% by 2030. The treatment of only those 
already in care will not translate into substantial reductions 
in HCV deaths or incidence. However, Malta is the only 
country in which the diagnosis coverage is estimated to be 
at such a high level.27 Progress could be made in different 
ways in the coming years: innovative means of increasing 
awareness and encouraging HCV testing in a range of 
settings are being explored46 and new technologies, such as 
point­of­care viral load finger­stick tests,47 should soon be 
available.48 Both awareness raising and simpler diagnostics 
could facilitate large increases in knowledge of HCV status 
as has occurred in the HIV arena.
Second, the HCV epidemic among PWID has a deciding 
role in determining whether incidence elim 
ination targets 
are met. The modelled strategy that resulted in incidence 
elimination being met by 2032 relied upon coverage of 
OST with NSP increasing to 40%: however, only 1% of 
PWID live in countries with such high coverage of these 
harm reduction services.39 If the effectiveness of those 
programmes is lower than has been estimated in some 
settings,36,37 then elimination becomes a much more 
remote prospect, with elimination not being reached until 
after 2050, even with high coverage of other interventions. 
This result, along with the finding that reinfection plays a

key role in delaying the year of incidence elimination, 
highlights that PWID prevention must be central to 
HCV policy. Targeted treatment­as­prevention approaches 
among PWID might reduce incidence,49 although this 
must be done in the context of enhanced harm reduction 
interventions and community involvement.50 Eliminating 
structural and systemic barriers such as the criminalisation 
of PWID or treatment restrictions on active drug users 
can improve access to health services.51,52 A Hepatitis C 
Action Plan programme in Scotland has shown that 
national reductions in incidence are possible through an 
integrated approach involving scaling up of OST with 
NSP along with increasing awareness and provision of 
HCV testing for PWID (including ever­PWID).53 Such 
progress relies on political will and reliable sources of 
funding that, in low­income and middle­income countries 
in particular, are often lacking—this is a serious challenge 
HCV prog 
rammes often face.54
Third, continued improvements in blood safety and 
infection control are key components of the global 
elimination intervention package and drive a large 
reduction in new infections. Although proven safety and 
control measures exist and have played a major part in 
reducing incidence in many settings,55,56 only 39% of 
countries worldwide operate haemovigilance systems,55 
and unsafe (often unnecessary) injections continue to be 
a major source of HCV infection.7,57 The reasons for the 
persistence of unsafe injections as a transmission route 
are complex,58 and context­specific management methods 
are necessary if there are to be continued reductions in 
the risk of HCV transmission via these routes.59
Finally, the global HCV epidemic is concentrated in a 
set of countries that could face myriad challenges in 
implementing the PWID harm reduction, infection 
control, and outreach screening initiatives required. This 
hurdle might make talk of elimination seem more 
tenuous but should also focus attention while illustrating 
that major progress can be made with policy changes in 
just a few places. In terms of global HCV epidemiology, 
and given the stated aims of WHO and the Sustainable 
Development Goals to “combat hepatitis”,60 progress 
made in these settings should be of primary concern.
These policy points reinforce and augment the 
conclusions drawn by other studies. Several modelling 
analyses have highlighted the challenge of reducing 
transmission among PWID and have advocated simul­
taneously scaling up prevention and treatment inter­
ventions to reduce prevalence.61,62 Our work extends this 
to show that, even on the global scale where incidence 
is dominated by non­PWID transmission, reducing 
incidence among PWID plays a key part in determining 
whether elimination targets are met. A recent study63 has 
incorporated dynamic modelling of PWID into a full 
population model of the HCV epidemic in Pakistan. The 
authors find that only with extremely high coverage of 
interventions can elimination targets be met. This 
result agrees with what we have shown on a global scale 
that even with exceptionally high intervention coverage, 
elimination targets are difficult to meet. An EU modelling 
study27 has suggested that mortality elimination targets 
can be met in this region. Similarly, we find that, provided 
there are ambitious increases in screening and treatment, 
mortality elimination targets are met in most regions by 
around 2030. The EU study did not, however, model 
incidence dynamically and could not draw conclusions 
regarding incidence targets. Our analysis has shown that 
even with extensive scale­up of prevention interventions, 
several regions do not meet incidence elimination targets 
before 2100, driven in large part by ongoing PWID 
transmission.
To produce a global analysis, we have had to manage a 
variety of data and modelling limitations. We used 
modelled estimates of mortality from the GBD project;4,34 
these have been produced for most countries and allow 
basic epidemic trends to be inferred even where other data 
are lacking. To manage the uncertainty this introduces, 
we built the model to be flexible when calibrating to 
these inputs because they are estimates rather than data. 
To simulate the treatment cascade, we used regional 
estimates to extrapolate to countries without data. This 
process necessarily smooths out country­level differences 
in diagnosis and treatment coverage, introducing error in 
some individual country projections. Country­level cascade 
information is, however, available for countries that 
account for about 60% of the global viraemic population, 
giving good resolution on the treatment cascade for most 
of the globally infected population. Furthermore, low 
overall treatment numbers compared with the size of the 
epidemic mean that error introduced through extrapolating 
to the remaining 40% of the viraemic population will have 
only a small impact on projections.
There is considerable uncertainty about the source of 
infections among the general population, which makes it 
impossible to be sure about the extent to which this route 
of transmission is being, and can be, reduced. Although 
WHO calls for no unsafe injections and 100% of blood 
donations screened with quality assurance,1 both the 
difficulty in reaching these targets and the many ways of 
being infected with HCV beyond these two routes 
(appendix) led us to specify only an 80% risk reduction 
among the general population in intervention 1; this is 
to be conservative regarding what is a necessarily vague 
intervention strategy. We varied this in sensitivity 
analysis to explore the impact this programme parameter 
had on outcomes. Similarly, the impact of PWID harm 
reduction interventions is uncertain outside of the 
primarily North American and European settings in 
which OST and NSP initiatives have been studied.36,37 
We varied this quantity in sensitivity analysis to account 
for this limitation, but in implementing PWID 
harm reduction globally we are assuming that such 
programmes can have equal success in all regions. Lastly, 
we did not model changes in the proportion of the 
population who are PWID. There is growing concern

about potential increases in the number of PWID in the 
USA,64 for instance, yet the relationship between non­
medical use of prescription opioids and initiation of 
injection drug use is not well understood.65 Conversely, 
in other regions such as Europe, the proportion of the 
population who are PWID might have decreased,66 such 
as in Scotland, which has reported a decline in injecting 
drug use over the past decade.67 With such uncertainty 
regarding possible changes in the proportion of the 
population who are PWID, we kept this quantity fixed 
and did not simulate possible increases or decreases in 
the future. Nevertheless, future structural interventions 
could reduce the number of PWID68 and so potentially 
limit the ongoing spread of HCV.
In conclusion, reaching WHO elimination targets is an 
extremely challenging aim that requires a multifaceted 
approach combining screening, prevention, and treatment 
with a focus on those countries in which burden is greatest. 
Such efforts will entail considerable practical challenges 
and have large cost implications—running into the tens of 
billions of US dollars by 2030 for a complete viral hepatitis 
strategy17—but many countries have made substantial 
progress despite this: Egypt empowered local facilities, 
created numerous oppor 
tunities for HCV screening, and 
treated 700 000 HCV­infected individuals with DAAs in 
2016;28,69 Australia has negotiated a volume­based pricing 
model for DAAs that encourages, rather than rations, the 
prescription of expensive DAA treatment courses;70 and 
Scotland has successfully coordinated national expansion 
of harm reduction services with HCV testing and treatment 
provision resulting in a sharp increase in people achieving 
sustained virological response.71 By using new tools and 
the examples of relevant countries to devise ambitious, 
integrated interventions, this modelling work has shown 
that substantial progress towards global elimination can be 
made while greatly reducing the burden of new infections 
and premature deaths.
