Abstract  
28 
Objective. To investigate the impact of knee joint loading exercise on articular 
29 
cartilage in people at risk of, or with established, knee osteoarthritis (OA) by 
30 
conducting a systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCT). 
31 
Design. We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and 
32 
Meta-analyses guidelines.  
33 
Data sources. We performed a literature search with no restriction on publication 
34 
year or language in MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, the Cochrane Central Register of 
35 
Controlled Trials and Web of Science up to September 2017. 
36 
Eligibility criteria. RCTs investigating the impact of exercise on MRI-assessed 
37 
articular cartilage in people over 18 years of age. 
38 
Results. We included nine trials, including a total of 14 comparisons of cartilage 
39 
morphometry, morphology and composition outcomes, of which two included 
40 
participants at increased risk of knee OA and 12 included participants with knee OA. 
41 
In participants at increased risk, one study comparison reported no effect on cartilage 
42 
defects and one had positive effects on glycosaminoglycans (GAG). In participants 
43 
with OA, six study comparisons reported no effect on cartilage thickness, volume or 
44 
defects; one reported a negative effect and one no effect on GAG; two reported a 
45 
positive effect and two no effect on collagen. 
46 
Conclusions. Knee joint loading exercise seems to not be harmful for articular 
47 
cartilage in people at increased risk of, or with, knee OA. However, the quality of 
48 
evidence was low, including some interventions studying activities considered 
49 
outside the therapeutic loading spectrum to promote cartilage health.

INTRODUCTION
INTRODUCTION 
65 
Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common joint disease and a major cause of 
66 
disability and pain.1. The OA prevalence has doubled since the mid-20th Century 2 
67 
with an expected higher incidence in the future.3 The annual total medical cost per 
68 
person suffering from OA is on average €11,100.4 
69 
 
70 
Articular cartilage breakdown is the hallmark of OA, with aggrecan loss being an 
71 
early sign of tissue degeneration. Many factors such as age, body mass index (BMI), 
72 
knee injury, inflammation, sex and family history independently, and as a result of 
73 
their interaction, contribute to its development and progression.5 6 For example, 
74 
approximately every second major knee injury from sports results in OA 10-15 years 
75 
later 7-9 and it has been estimated that at least 12% of the total burden of knee OA 
76 
originates from knee injury.10 Hypothetically, interventions targeting younger patients 
77 
at increased risk of OA (e.g. following sports injury), or in the early stages of the 
78 
disease, increase the chances of slowing down articular cartilage breakdown, since 
79 
the integrity of the cartilage may still be intact with little or no aggrecan loss. 
80 
 
81 
Therapeutic exercise is a first-line treatment in OA: it is safe,11 and effectively 
82 
reduces pain and improves function.12-14  Less is known about the effects from 
83 
therapeutic exercise on knee joint articular cartilage. However, exercise at higher 
84 
doses, such as playing sports at elite level, is associated with development of OA, 
85 
suggesting not only injury but also load in itself as being a contributing factor.15 16 The 
86 
mechanical loading generated from exercise, in combination with cell biology, and in 
87 
some cases inflammatory factors, may alter the function of articular cartilage.17 While 
88 
there are no conclusive studies, it has been suggested that exercise may prevent or 
89 
delay OA onset.18 In support of this, two cohort studies found that a moderate dose of 
90 
physical activity could slow down cartilage degeneration in middle-aged individuals at 
91 
early OA stages.19 20 Furthermore, initiating an accelerated and progressive weight-
92 
  
5 
bearing intervention a few hours after cartilage surgery was shown to be safe for the 
93 
cartilage and resulted in more favourable clinical outcomes compared to a delayed 
94 
knee joint loading exercise intervention.21 Also, in patients having had meniscectomy, 
95 
therapeutic exercise increased cartilage glycosaminoglycan content.22 However, 
96 
patients at risk of, or with, knee OA still often believe that exercise may wear down 
97 
their knee joints, creating a barrier to exercise.25 
98 
 
99 
Systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) provide the highest quality 
100 
of evidence for assessing effectiveness and harms of treatments. Current knowledge 
101 
in this area of interest has not been summarised systematically. Therefore, we aimed 
102 
to review the existing evidence regarding the impact of knee joint loading exercise on 
103 
articular cartilage. 
104 
METHODS
METHODS 
105 
Terminology 
106 
As defined by the authors of the original papers, participants at risk of knee OA are 
107 
those with risk factors (e.g. knee injury treated with or without surgery, or BMI 
108 
(Kg/m2) ≥25) associated with the development or progression of the disease, while 
109 
participants with OA are those with a clinical diagnosis of OA (i.e. according to the 
110 
American College of Rheumatology criteria) with or without radiographic signs of 
111 
knee OA (Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grade >1), in the tibiofemoral and/or patellofemoral 
112 
compartments of one or both knees 23.  
113 
Articular cartilage outcomes assessed by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) were 
114 
classified into morphometry (i.e. thickness and volume), morphology (i.e. defects) or 
115 
composition (i.e. glycosaminoglycans assessed by dGEMRIC and collagen assessed 
116 
with T2-mapping in seven comparisons). 
117 
The term ‘knee joint loading exercise’ refers to “the stimuli applied to the knee joint 
118 
from ‘exercise’ or ‘exercise therapy”. The term ‘exercise’ refers to “physical activities, 
119 
  
6 
which are usually done on a regular basis with the intention of improving or 
120 
maintaining physical fitness or health” and ‘physical activity’ refers to “any bodily 
121 
movement produced by skeletal muscles that requires energy expenditure”. The term 
122 
‘exercise therapy’ refers to “a regimen or plan of physical activities designed and 
123 
prescribed for specific therapeutic goals with the purpose to restore normal 
124 
musculoskeletal function or to reduce pain caused by diseases or injuries” 24. 
125 
Protocol 
126 
This systematic review is reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for 
127 
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines (Appendix A). Study 
128 
selection, eligibility criteria, data extraction and statistical analysis were performed 
129 
according to the Cochrane Collaboration guidelines 25 and published in a protocol in 
130 
the PROSPERO database (CRD42016039536).  
131 
Eligibility criteria 
132 
We included RCTs investigating the impact of knee joint loading exercise on articular 
133 
cartilage in people over 18 years of age. Studies were excluded when no-full text was 
134 
available, and when treatment arms involved interventions other than knee joint 
135 
loading exercise that might have impacted on the articular cartilage. 
136 
Literature search 
137 
A systematic literature search was performed with no restriction on publication year 
138 
or language in MEDLINE via PubMed, EMBASE via Ovid, CINAHL (including 
139 
preCINAHL) via EBSCO, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials 
140 
(CENTRAL) and Web of Science (WoS) up to May 2016. The search was repeated 
141 
for the period from May 2016 to September 2017 in these databases to identify 
142 
additional studies published before manuscript submission. 
143 
  
7 
Search methods and study selection 
144 
The search was firstly performed in MEDLINE (Appendix B) and then customized for 
145 
EMBASE, CENTRAL, WoS and CINAHL. All terms were searched, if possible, both 
146 
as keywords [MeSH] and as text words in titles and abstracts [TIAB].  In MEDLINE 
147 
and EMBASE, animal studies were identified and removed before screening all the 
148 
studies, using a validated animal filter 26 27. Initially, two reviewers (AB and CJ) 
149 
independently screened titles and abstracts and all studies deemed eligible by at 
150 
least one of the reviewers was checked independently in full-text by the same two 
151 
reviewers. In addition, reference lists from retrieved publications and systematic 
152 
reviews published after January 2010 were screened. Disagreements between the 
153 
two reviewers in inclusion were discussed until consensus was reached.  
154 
Data collection 
155 
A customized data extraction form was developed for each of the articular cartilage 
156 
outcome categories: morphometry (i.e. thickness and volume), morphology (i.e. 
157 
defects) or composition (i.e. glycosaminoglycans and collagen). These outcomes 
158 
were estimated from the combination of different cartilage compartments (i.e. medial 
159 
and lateral) when data were available. Otherwise, values from the medial and lateral 
160 
values of the tibia, femur and the patella were used. Data were extracted by the first 
161 
and second authors (AB and CJ) from tables and graphs of published manuscripts. 
162 
The following information was mandatory: authors of the study, year of publication, 
163 
design of the trial, intervention characteristics, location of the trial (in the case of 
164 
multi-center studies, primary investigator affiliation was applied), number of 
165 
participants allocated (to the exercise and control groups respectively), the 
166 
participants’ average age, average body mass index (BMI (Kg/m2)), the duration of 
167 
the study (presented in weeks), and the MRI characteristics. When several 
168 
intervention groups were included in a study, the between-group difference was 
169 
reported for each possible comparison. For example, when a study had two 
170 
  
8 
intervention groups (A and B) and one control group (C), we compared A vs. C and B 
171 
vs. C, and reported the results as two separate study comparisons. This procedure is 
172 
in accordance with the Cochrane handbook.25 
173 
Narrative synthesis of results 
174 
Between–group difference 
175 
We assessed the effect of knee joint loading exercise as positive (‘+’) or negative (‘-‘) 
176 
when a statistically significant (P<0.05) improvement or decline in the outcome of 
177 
interest was reported for the overall cartilage or at least one of the cartilage 
178 
compartments assessed in the intervention group compared with the control group. If 
179 
none of the compartments showed an increase or a decrease in the outcome of 
180 
interest, we reported this finding as no effect (‘=’).  
181 
Increased T2 values have been associated with deteriorated collagen orientation and 
182 
increased hydration 28 29, which is considered to have a negative impact on the 
183 
cartilage. Therefore, we reported increased T2 values as negative (‘-‘) and decreased 
184 
T2 values as positive (‘+’) for the cartilage. A decrease in cartilage thickness/volume 
185 
was interpreted as negative for the cartilage. Accordingly, an increase in cartilage 
186 
thickness/volume was interpreted as potentially beneficial. However, the proof of a 
187 
positive effect on cartilage volume/thickness would need additional information, since 
188 
increased cartilage volume/thickness may also be related to the growth of the 
189 
subchondral bone for example. 
190 
Within–group difference 
191 
Additionally, we investigated within-group differences assessing the effect of knee 
192 
joint loading exercise as positive (‘+’) or negative (‘-‘) when an improvement or a 
193 
decline in the outcome of interest was reported between pre and post intervention, 
194 
and as no effect (‘=’) if none of the compartments showed an increase or a decrease 
195 
in the outcome of interest. 
196 
  
9 
Overall quality of evidence 
197 
Risk of bias 
198 
Study quality was assessed by rating the risk of selection bias, performance bias, 
199 
detection bias, attrition bias, reporting bias and other sources of bias. Two reviewers 
200 
(AB and CJ) independently assessed whether each of the following domains was 
201 
adequate (e.g. low, unclear, or high risk of bias): ‘sequence generation’, ‘allocation 
202 
concealment’, 'blinding', ‘incomplete outcome data addressed’, ‘selective outcome 
203 
reporting’ or ‘other bias’ (e.g. funding) 25. Disagreements in initial ratings of 
204 
methodological quality assessment were discussed between the two reviewers until 
205 
consensus was reached.  
206 
Knee joint loading exercise quality assessment 
207 
Based on a combination of theoretical and clinical considerations, two of the authors 
208 
(CJ and EMR) independently assessed the anticipated impact of the knee joint 
209 
loading interventions on cartilage (low, moderate or high) and if the dose was 
210 
considered adequate to presume positive cartilage modifications were possible. High 
211 
impact activities (e.g. jumping) 30 and participation in sports 15 is associated with 
212 
cartilage deformation and increased risk of radiographic OA. Similarly, lack of knee 
213 
joint loading in the form of knee immobilisation 31 or sedentary behaviour19 20 is 
214 
associated with detrimental cartilage changes. Therefore, interventions including 
215 
activities being considered outside the therapeutic loading spectrum were assessed 
216 
as inadequate to promote cartilage health. Accordingly, the anticipated impact was 
217 
considered to be too high in interventions focusing on jumping and too low in aquatic 
218 
exercise. 
219 
The GRADE assessment 
220 
The overall quality of evidence for the estimates was evaluated using the GRADE 
221 
(Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach. 
222 
  
10 
The GRADE is a systematic approach to rate the quality of evidence across studies 
223 
for specific outcomes. It is based on five domains that involve the methodological 
224 
flaws of the studies (i.e. risk of bias), the heterogeneity of results across studies (i.e. 
225 
inconsistency), the generalizability of the findings to the target population (i.e. 
226 
indirectness), the precision of the estimates and the risk of publication bias.

Study selection and characteristics 
232 
The literature search identified a total of 2,868 unique publications, of which 21 
233 
individual RCTs were identified as potentially eligible. Ultimately, we included nine 
234 
papers, involving 14 study comparisons. MRI-assessed cartilage morphometry was 
235 
investigated in four 32 33, cartilage morphology in three 34-36 and cartilage composition 
236 
in seven comparisons 37-40. One study was reported in two different papers 37 41. 
237 
Multanen et al. 37 reported findings in the tibiofemoral compartment and Koli et al. 41 
238 
in the patellofemoral compartment of the same participants following the same 
239 
exercise intervention. We included both papers and counted them as one study with 
240 
two study comparisons, as suggested in the Cochrane guidelines 25. 
241 
Two study comparisons investigated the effect of knee joint loading exercise in 
242 
participants at increased risk of developing OA: one in participants having had 
243 
arthroscopic partial meniscectomy 
28 and the other in overweight or obese 
244 
participants 36 40. Twelve study comparisons focused on participants with OA 32-35 37-39 
245 
41.  
246 
  
11 
Participant characteristics 
247 
The overall number of participants in the included studies was 702, with a mean age 
248 
(SD) of 57.7 years (6.5) and a mean BMI (Kg/m2) (SD) of 29.5(4.4). The overall 
249 
percentage of women was 81.7%, (Table 1).

Outcome measures 
261 
In the two study comparisons including participants at risk of OA, articular cartilage 
262 
was assessed as cartilage morphology using the semi-quantitative MRI Osteoarthritis 
263 
Knee Score (MOAKS) scoring system 36, and cartilage composition as GAG via 
264 
dGEMRIC index 40. 
265 
In the 12 study comparisons focusing on participants with established OA, articular 
266 
cartilage was assessed using cartilage morphometry in four 32 and morphology with 
267 
semi-quantitative scoring systems in three 33-35. Cartilage composition was assessed 
268 
in seven comparisons as GAG via dGEMRIC 37 38 or collagen via T2–mapping 37-39 43. 
269 
Detailed characteristics of participants and outcome measure characteristics are 
270 
reported in Table 2. 
271 
Knee joint loading exercise interventions 
272 
Knee joint loading exercise interventions differ substantially among studies. All but 
273 
one of the included trials tested the effect of a therapeutic exercise program. One 
274 
trial tested the effect from a general physical activity program in which participants 
275 
were encouraged to take part in physical activity classes, for example, Nordic-
276 
walking, volleyball or modern dance”.36 Furthermore, all the included studies 
277 
compared a knee joint loading exercise intervention to a non-exercising control group 
278 
treatment such as local heat or oral glucosamine. Detailed characteristics of knee 
279 
joint loading exercise interventions are reported in Table 2. 
280 
 
281

Narrative synthesis of results 
282 
Meta-analysis was not considered appropriate because of the substantial 
283 
heterogeneity between study interventions, patient characteristics and outcome 
284 
variables.44 Instead, we summarised the results of these studies narratively, to 
285 
provide a clear critical appraisal of the evidence, as recommended by the guidelines 
286 
on the conduct of narrative synthesis in systematic reviews.45 
287 
Between-group difference in participants at risk of OA 
288 
In the participants at risk of OA, one study comparison in overweight women with a 
289 
mean age of 56 years reported no effect on cartilage defects (MOAKS) 36 and one in 
290 
mostly men with a mean age of 46 years, having had arthroscopic partial 
291 
meniscectomy, reported positive cartilage composition changes on GAG as 
292 
assessed from dGEMRIC 40.  
293 
Between-group difference in participants with established OA 
294 
In participants with established OA, six study comparisons found no effect of knee 
295 
joint loading exercise on cartilage thickness, volume or defects 32-35, one study 
296 
comparison reported no effect 37 on GAG and one reported a negative effect on the 
297 
cartilage composition of the medial condyle of the femur, both assessing GAG via 
298 
dGEMRIC 38. On the contrary, the same knee joint loading exercise intervention that 
299 
reported negative effects on GAG also reported a positive effect on collagen 
300 
assessed using T2-mapping in the cartilage of the posterior medial femoral condyle 
301 
and central medial tibial condyle 38. Two publications from the same RCT reported a 
302 
positive effect on collagen T2–mapping in the patellar cartilage 41 and no effect on 
303 
the cartilage of the medial condyle of the femur 37. Lastly, one study comparison 
304 
reported no effect 37 39 on collagen T2-mapping 39 (Table 3).

Within-group difference  
313 
The within-group differences analysis investigating articular cartilage changes pre to 
314 
post intervention (within-group findings), showed that knee joint loading exercise 
315 
increased cartilage volume 32, and had a positive effect on cartilage defects (SPRG) 
316 
in the medial femoral condyle 34 and on GAG in the medial and lateral compartment 
317 
of the femur and lateral compartment of the tibia 37 40. Furthermore, positive effects 
318 
were also reported on the patellar cartilage 41 and on the posterior medial femoral 
319 
condyle and central medial tibial condyle 38. There was only one negative within-
320 
group finding out of 14 comparisons. 
321 
Sub-group analysis on cartilage compartment 
322 
Three out of nine studies, assessed the effect of knee joint loading exercise on the 
323 
patellar compartment in addition to the tibiofemoral compartment.32 36 43 In one 
324 
study,36 the patellar and tibiofemoral compartment were combined for the 
325 
assessment of exercise on cartilage health, not allowing for comparisons of different 
326 
cartilage compartments. In contrast, two studies 32 43 analysed the patellar and 
327 
tibiofemoral compartments separately. One study reported a beneficial effect on the 
328 
collagen matrix in the patellar but not in the tibiofemoral compartment, 43 and another 
329 
study reported no effect in cartilage volume or thickness for the patellar and 
330 
tibiofemoral compartment.32 
331 
Impact of sex on cartilage health 
332 
We found no indication of difference in the effect of exercise on cartilage health 
333 
between the sexes. Four studies, seven study comparisons, included only women, of 
334 
which two study comparisons reported a positive effect on collagen,38 43 one reported 
335 
a negative effect on glycosaminoglycans 38 and four reported no effect of knee joint 
336 
loading exercise on cartilage health.36 37 39 
337 
  
19 
Five studies, seven study comparisons, included both men and women, of which one 
338 
reported a beneficial effect on glycosaminoglycans 40 and six reported no effect of 
339 
knee joint loading exercise on cartilage health (Table 3).32 34 35 
340 
Quality of evidence 
341 
Risk of bias  
342 
Overall, the majority of the studies applied proper randomization, allocation and 
343 
blinding of the outcome assessment. In contrast, all the studies failed to clearly 
344 
report, or inadequately addressed, dropouts of participants in the analyses (attrition 
345 
bias, Table 3).  
346 
Knee joint loading exercise quality 
347 
When evaluated and rated independently by two of the co-authors (CJ and EMR), 
348 
some of the exercise interventions were assessed as including activities being 
349 
considered outside the therapeutic loading spectrum and therefore not necessarily 
350 
adequate to promote positive articular cartilage (Table 2). This classification was 
351 
purely done for descriptive purposes, and the number of studies did not allow for 
352 
subgroup analyses. 
353 
The GRADE assessment 
354 
The inadequacy of some knee joint loading interventions, the small number of 
355 
studies and the few participants involved limits the generalizability of our findings. 
356 
Therefore, due to this indirectness and imprecision, the overall quality of evidence 
357 
was deemed low. (Appendix C).  
358 
 
359

DISCUSSION 
361 
Our findings suggest that knee joint loading exercise seems not to be harmful for 
362 
articular cartilage in people at increased risk of, or with, knee OA. However, the 
363 
quality of evidence was low. 
364 
Articular cartilage morphometry and morphology 
365 
The inconclusive findings about knee joint loading and the impact on cartilage 
366 
thickness, volume and defects may relate to the heterogeneity of the populations, the 
367 
interventions studied, or the outcomes used. In fact, when evaluated and rated 
368 
independently by two of the co-authors (CJ and EMR), not all the exercise 
369 
interventions were assessed as adequate to promote positive articular cartilage 
370 
changes. In some cases, the dose was considered too low and in one case, the type 
371 
of exercise (jumps) was considered excessive for the cartilage of older women who 
372 
had mild OA. Additionally, the compliance with the exercise interventions 
373 
investigating cartilage morphometry or morphology was generally poor. The resulting 
374 
inadequate mechanical stimuli could potentially be at least partly responsible for the 
375 
lack of effect. On the other hand, MRI–based cartilage assessments have been 
376 
shown to be sensitive enough to detect between-group morphometry and 
377 
morphology changes in previous randomised studies using quantitative and semi–
378 
quantitative methods 46. Nevertheless, in our review, the studies assessing cartilage 
379 
with both quantitative and semi-quantitative methods failed to report a change for 
380 
either method, suggesting the lack of positive effect was not due to poor 
381 
responsiveness of the evaluation methods.  
382 
Articular cartilage composition  
383 
It is well known that alterations in articular cartilage composition is a marker of early 
384 
OA changes 47. Negative changes in cartilage composition may therefore be 
385 
expected to occur prior to changes in morphometry and morphology cartilage 
386 
parameters 48. None of the studies included in our review allowed for a comparison of 
387 
  
21 
treatment effects on both structural and compositional changes of the cartilage. 
388 
However, GAG and collagen assessed as dGEMRIC and T-2 mapping, respectively, 
389 
were the only outcomes that showed a response to the treatment interventions, 
390 
supporting the theory that these early OA markers are sufficiently sensitive to detect 
391 
treatment effects in individuals with early or established OA. Nevertheless, six out of 
392 
seven study comparisons found no effect or beneficial effect or beneficial effect on 
393 
cartilage composition, highlighting that knee joint loading exercise seems to be at 
394 
least safe in patients at increased risk of, or with, knee OA.  
395 
Limitations 
396 
This study has some limitations. The heterogeneity of the interventions, patient 
397 
characteristics and outcome variables did not support the use of a meta-analysis. 
398 
Instead, in accordance with the Cochrane Handbook, we described our findings 
399 
narratively.25 Although, from a statistical point of view, there is no restriction on study 
400 
number or similarity, it is important to consider the conceptual diversity of the 
401 
included studies, for the meta-analysis to be meaningful for researchers, clinicians 
402 
and patients.44 Furthermore, the low compliance with the exercise interventions in 
403 
studies investigating articular cartilage morphology and morphometry, limits the 
404 
possibility of concluding whether exercise had a positive or negative impact on these 
405 
outcome measures. Additionally, the included studies did not allow for comparison of 
406 
different exercise programs and/or comparisons of specific cartilage compartments, 
407 
since all studies included a non-exercising control arm and only two studies reported 
408 
the patellofemoral compartment separately. Thus, our findings are restricted to the 
409 
effect of increased knee joint loading from therapeutic exercise compared to no 
410 
change in knee joint loading, particularly in the tibiofemoral compartment. As no 
411 
meta-analysis was performed, precision, inconsistency and publication bias were 
412 
based on the narrative synthesis of results.  Finally, one trial included the control 
413 
treatment of glucosamine 34 and another trial included a control of local heat 
414 
  
22 
treatment.39 Recent systematic reviews conclude that glucosamine does not impact 
415 
cartilage health 49 50 and there is no evidence to suggest an effect of local heat 
416 
treatment on articular cartilage.  
417 
Implications for researchers and clinicians 
418 
More high quality RCTs are needed to further investigate the impact of knee joint 
419 
loading exercise on articular cartilage in patients at increased risk of, or with, knee 
420 
OA. To increase the possibility of finding positive effects, available results suggest 
421 
future studies need to focus on interventions in the form of supervised weight-bearing 
422 
exercise therapy of sufficient dose in younger subjects at risk or in early stages of the 
423 
disease, allowing for evaluation of cartilage composition with measures such as 
424 
dGEMRIC and T2-mapping. 
425 
CONCLUSION 
426 
We narratively summarized the impact of knee joint loading exercise on knee joint 
427 
articular cartilage in the participants at risk of, or with, knee OA included in 
428 
randomized controlled trials of exercise. Knee joint loading exercise seems not to 
429 
harm articular cartilage in participants at increased risk of, or with, knee OA. 
430 
However, the quality of evidence was low, including some interventions studying 
431 
activities considered outside the therapeutic loading spectrum to promote cartilage 
432 
health.
