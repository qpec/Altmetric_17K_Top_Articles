Abstract
Background: Caffeine has both excitatory and vasoconstrictive effects on central nervous system. Caffeine use
might be associated with development and chronification of migraine. We aimed to evaluate the effect of caffeine
cessation on the acute treatment of migraine.
Methods: We prospectively recruited migraine patients who consumed caffeine drinks daily and instructed them to
discontinue their caffeine intake. Triptans were prescribed for acute treatment. Patients were followed up after at
least two weeks after screening and evaluated the efficacy of acute treatment with the migraine assessment of
current therapy (Migraine-ACT) questionnaire. Excellent efficacy was defined as Migraine-ACT score of 4. Chronic
migraine, body mass index, allodynia, depression, anxiety, antiemetic use, and use of prophylactic medication were
included in the multivariate analysis if the univariate p < 0.2.
Findings: Among 108 patients included, 36 completely discontinued their caffeine intake (abstinence group). The
efficacy of acute treatment was assessed at median 34.5 days (interquartile range, 28–89) after the screening. Twenty-six
patients (72.2 %) in the abstinence group and 29 (40.3 %) in the non-abstinence group reported an excellent efficacy
(p = 0.002). The abstinence group also showed a trend toward greater reduction of headache impact test-6 (HIT-6) scores
(p = 0.085). Caffeine abstinence was independently associated with an excellent efficacy of acute treatment (multivariate
odds ratio, 3.2; 95 % confidence interval, 1.2–8.4; p = 0.018) after controlling for covariates.
Conclusions: Caffeine abstinence is associated with better efficacy of acute migraine treatment. Our uncontrolled study
results encourage a further confirmatory study on this issue.

Introduction
Caffeine, the most popular psychostimulant drug in the
world [1], may act as a double-edged sword in migraine
patients. Caffeine has been used for the adjuvant treat-
ment of acute migraine attacks. High caffeine consump-
tion is associated with the development and chronification
of migraine, although the association is not strong [2–4].
There are conflicting reports regarding the action of
caffeine on pain. Previous studies have shown a small
but significant additive effect of caffeine for the control
of headache and non-headache pain [5, 6]. However,
preclinical studies showed that caffeine has an intrinsic
antinociception at extremely high doses (25–100 mg/
kg) but also can inhibit antinociception at lower doses
[7]. If caffeine has intrinsic analgesic effect, it is also
possible that chronic caffeine use may induce a medication-
overuse state in migraineurs. In contrast, if caffeine has
anti-nociceptice effect, it should affect on the outcome of
acute headache treatment. Both assumptions may warrant
a prospective study regarding impact of caffeine cessation
on acute migraine treatment. However, there has been no
prospective study addressing the impact of caffeine cessa-
tion in migraineurs.
Through competitive inhibition of adenosine receptor,
caffeine results in vasoconstriction on cerebral blood
vessels [8, 9]. Acute withdrawal of caffeine is therefore

 related with rebound cerebral vasodilatation, which may
be a cause of caffeine withdrawal headache. However,
the rebound increase of cerebral blood flow can be re-
stored after 2 weeks of caffeine abstinence [9]. In the
present study, we aimed to evaluate the effect of caffeine
cessation for at least 2 weeks on the outcome of acute
migraine treatment in a prospective setting.
Methods
Patients
We prospectively recruited consecutive first-visit pa-
tients who visited the Samsung Medical Center head-
ache clinic from Mar 2015 and Sep 2015. Patients who
(1) were diagnosed with migraine, and (2) consumed
any kind of caffeinated drink on a daily basis were con-
sidered eligible for the study. Patients were excluded if
they (1) had medication overuse headache at the time
of screening, (2) were diagnosed with probable migraine,
(3) were contraindicated to oral triptans (serotonin 1B/1D
receptor agonist), (4) had active psychiatric illnesses, or
(5) refused to participate in the scheduled follow-up evalu-
ation. Among them, patients who took acute medications
at least three times before the follow-up study were finally
analyzed. The diagnosis of migraine, probable migraine,
and medication overuse headache was based on the inter-
national classification of headache disorders, 3rd edition
beta version (ICHD-3 beta) [10]. The Samsung Medical
Center Institutional Review Board approved this study.
Evaluations
The daily dose and sources of caffeine were assessed by
both a questionnaire and interview. Sources of caffeine
included brewed or drip coffee, instant coffee, caffein-
ated tea, cola, and energy drink, with estimated doses
of 136 mg, 96 mg, 40 mg, 36 mg, and 80 mg per 8-oz
serving, respectively [11].
The baseline assessment included a structured head-
ache questionnaire, which evaluated the headache char-
acteristics, headache frequencies, vascular risk factors,
smoking, and alcohol intake. The headache-related qual-
ity of life was assessed using the Korean version of the
headache impact test-6 (HIT-6) in a previously validated
form [12]. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale
(HADS) was used for screening comorbid depression
and anxiety disorders. Recent depression was defined as
a HADS-depression (HADS-D) score of ≥8, and recent
anxiety as a HADS-anxiety (HADS-A) score of ≥8.
Allodynia was assessed with the allodynia symptom
checklist-12 (ASC-12) [13]. Patients were classified as
allodynic when they had ASC-12 scores of ≥3 [13].
Intervention
All the patients were instructed by the investigators
(C.-S.C., M.J.L, H.C.) to abruptly discontinue caffeine
intake. Pharmacological treatments were not controlled
in this study and prescribed at the physician’s discre-
tion. Triptan agents were used for the acute abortive
medication. Different triptans were individually prescribed
per the patient’s headache characteristics, such as head-
ache duration, time to peak intensity, and recurrence pat-
tern [14, 15]. Antiemetics were given to patients if they
reported prominent nausea or vomiting during their typ-
ical headache attack. Simple analgesics or non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) were not prescribed in
this study. All the patients were instructed to take their
acute medication before the headache became severe.
Caffeinated medications were prohibited. Preventive med-
ications were prescribed at the physician’s discretion. Pa-
tients were instructed to record their daily consumption
of caffeinated drinks, acute abortive medication use, and
the efficacy of the medication in a daily headache diary.
Follow-up
To evaluate impacts of caffeine cessation after reso-
lution of rebound cerebral vasodilation and consequent
caffeine-withdrawal headache, patients were followed
up at least 2 weeks after the screening [9, 10]. Ideally,
the first follow-up visit was planned at 4 ± 2 weeks.
Acute medications were not changed during the obser-
vation period. At the follow-up visit, the caffeine intake
was assessed based on the headache diary and an interview
by the physicians. Caffeine abstinence was defined as the
complete cessation of any caffeinated agents. If caffeine had
not been discontinued (“non-abstinence”), patients were
sub-classified as “reduction” and “non-reduction” based on
the average daily dose of caffeinated drinks.
Patients were instructed to complete the structured
follow-up questionnaire, which included questions on the
monthly frequency of headaches, the number of acute
abortive medications taken per month, and the HIT-6
form [12]. Patients completed the migraine assessment of
current therapy (migraine-ACT) questionnaire [16] when
the cumulative use of acute treatment was more than
three times. If a patient took the acute medication less
than three times, he or she was followed up again to
evaluate efficacy of at least three trials of acute treatment.
The migraine-ACT questionnaire is a validated method to
assess the consistency (item 1), global assessment of relief
(item 2), impact (item 3), and emotional response (item 4)
associated with the acute migraine medication [16].
Statistical analysis
The chi-square and Fisher’s exact tests were performed
to compare the categorical variables between the groups.
Student’s t-test was used for the continuous variables.
Excellent efficacy of acute treatment was defined as an
ACT score of 4. Daily dose of caffeine consumption was
categorized as ≥200, <200, and 0 mg/day and tested by
Lee et al. The Journal of Headache and Pain  (2016) 17:71

 using a linear-by-linear association tests in relation to
ACT subscores. HIT-6 scores were compared only in pa-
tients with a follow-up interval of more than 1 month.
Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis
was performed to determine the independent effect of
caffeine cessation on the rate of excellent efficacy of
acute treatment. Confounders, including chronic mi-
graine, body mass index, allodynia, depression, anxiety,
antiemetic use, different triptans, and use of prophylactic
medication, were tested by using a forward stepwise

 multivariate logistic regression model. Daily dose of caf-
feine intake at the follow-up was also tested in the afore-
mentioned univariate and multivariate logistic models.
To test if there is an impact of higher (>200 mg/day)
baseline caffeine consumption on the caffeine cessation
and efficacy of acute headache treatment, an interaction
analysis was performed with multivariate logistic regres-
sion analysis.
Statistical analyses were performed using the commer-
cially available SPSS software version 18.0 (IBM, North
Castle, NY, USA). A p value <0.05 was considered statis-
tically significant.
Findings
Among the 113 eligible patients, we included 108 who took
their acute medication at least 3 times before the follow-up
visit. At the follow-up, 36 (33.3 %) patients had discontin-
ued the consumption of caffeine (“abstinence group”),
while 72 (66.7 %) had not (“non-abstinence group”).
The patients’ demographics are shown in Table 1.
The abstinence group had a longer history of migraine
(p = 0.010) and higher baseline HIT-6 scores (p = 0.018)
than the non-abstinence group. Both groups had fre-
quent migraine attacks with median headache days of 9
per month. Otherwise, there were no significant differ-
ences in the demographics, comorbidities, and head-
ache characteristics between the two groups.
Median interval from the first visit to second visit was
31 (interquartile range [IQR] 21 – 37) days. Twenty-three
patients who took their medication less than three times
were followed up again. Finally, all patients completed the
efficacy of acute treatment at median 34.5 (IQR 28 – 89)
days after the screening. Twenty-six patients (72.2 %) in
the abstinence group reported an excellent efficacy, which
is significantly higher than in the non-abstinence group
(40.3 %, p = 0.002; Table 1). The distribution of the ACT
scores is shown in Fig. 1. Among 79 patients with more
than 1-month follow-up, the cessation group (n = 29) also
showed a trend toward greater reduction of HIT-6 scores
than non-abstinence group (n = 50; p = 0.085, Table 1).
There were no differences in headache intensity and
monthly headache days between the abstinence and non-
abstinence groups.
A dose-dependent relationship was present between the
daily dose of caffeinated agents and the components of
the ACT questionnaire (Fig. 2). A significant trend was
found between daily caffeine dose and ACT subscores of
consistency, 2-h pain free response, functioning, and the
total score (p for trend = 0.001, 0.001, 0.003, and 0.001),
but not in the emotional assessment (p for trend = 0.161).
Univariate analysis revealed significant variables asso-
ciated with the excellent efficacy of acute therapy.
Caffeine abstinence (univariate OR 3.9, 95 % CI 1.6–
9.2, p = 0.002) was associated with excellent efficacy.
The daily consumption of caffeinated drinks showed a
negative dose-dependent association with the excellent
efficacy of acute treatment (OR 0.5, 95 % CI 0.3–0.9
per an increase of 100 mg caffeine/day, p = 0.015). In
the multivariate analysis, caffeine abstinence was inde-
pendently associated with an excellent efficacy of acute
treatment (multivariate OR 3.2, 95 % CI 1.2–8.4, p = 0.018)
after controlling for significant covariates. There was no
interaction of baseline caffeine consumption (≥200 vs
<200 mg/day) and caffeine cessation on the efficacy of
acute headache treatment (p for interaction = 0.814)
Discussion
The main finding of our study is that the complete ces-
sation of daily caffeine intake is independently associated
with the excellent efficacy of acute treatment of mi-
graine. A negative dose-dependent relationship was found
between the daily caffeine intake and the efficacy of the
acute migraine medication in multiple aspects.
In this observational study, we demonstrated a benefi-
cial effect of caffeine cessation on the acute treatment of
migraine. In the brain, caffeine result in an increased
release of excitatory neurotransmitters through competi-
tive inhibition of adenosine A1 receptor and vasocon-
striction via A2 receptor antagonism on cerebral blood
vessels [8]. Chronic caffeine intake may lead to the up-
regulation of adenosine receptors and compensatory ele-
vation in the plasma concentrations of adenosine, which
is a potent vasodilator that precipitates migraine head-
aches [17, 18]. Therefore, vasoconstrictive effects of trip-
tan may be negatively affected by daily caffeine intake.
Although caffeine cessation might be beneficial in mi-
graine treatment, it can be complicated by caffeine-
withdrawal headache [19]. Rebound cerebral vasodilation,

treatment (Migraine-ACT)

 which is a mechanism of caffeine-withdrawal headache,
can be normalized after 2 weeks of caffeine abstinence [9].
We therefore used at least 2-week discontinuation of
caffeine in this study.
To date, there is no consensus recommendation how
clinicians should explain about caffeine intake to mi-
graine patients. We classified the baseline and follow-up
caffeine consumption with a cutoff of 200 mg/day, which
is associated with acute analgesic effect and caffeine-
withdrawal headache [10, 18]. Our data showed that the
baseline dose of caffeine did not affect the impact of
caffeine cessation. That is, high-dose caffeine consumers
as well as low- to moderate-dose consumers can benefit
from the abrupt caffeine discontinuation. However, the
dose of current caffeine intake was associated with dif-
ferent aspects of ACT scores in the present study. The
outcome was even better after complete discontinuation
than low-dose caffeine consumption. Taken together,
our study results might indicate that migraine patients
may benefit from complete abstinence of caffeine, simi-
larly to the abrupt discontinuation of acute analgesics
for detoxification in patients with medication overuse
headache [20, 21].
Our study was not without limitations. First, we did
not use the same triptan agents to all patients. Different
triptan agents may have different efficacy. However, we
adjusted the possible influence of different agents by
using the multivariate analysis. Second, it is possible that
the caffeine consumption was influenced by the efficacy
of the acute medication. However, the most common
reasons for non-cessation were a desire to stay awake,
rather than as a rescue for acute headache attack. Third,
caffeine cessation may represent a good compliance and
doctor-patient relationship. However, in our quantitative
analysis, doses of daily caffeine intake were related with
functional but not with emotional assessment of acute
treatment efficacy. Fourth, we did not prospectively col-
lect data regarding caffeine-withdrawal headache. The
risk of headache exacerbation could not be determined
in our study.
In conclusion, our uncontrolled study suggest that caf-
feine cessation might be beneficial for acute migraine
treatment. Further confirmatory studies may be neces-
sary to prove the causal relationships.
