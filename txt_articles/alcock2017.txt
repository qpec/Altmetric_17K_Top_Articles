Background: There is increasing policy interest in the potential for vegetation in urban areas to mitigate harmful
effects of air pollution on respiratory health. We aimed to quantify relationships between tree and green space
density and asthma-related hospitalisations, and explore how these varied with exposure to background air
pollution concentrations.
Methods: Population standardised asthma hospitalisation rates (1997–2012) for 26,455 urban residential areas
of England were merged with area-level data on vegetation and background air pollutant concentrations. We
fitted negative binomial regression models using maximum likelihood estimation to obtain estimates of asthma-
vegetation relationships at different levels of pollutant exposure.
Results: Green space and gardens were associated with reductions in asthma hospitalisation when pollutant
exposures were lower but had no significant association when pollutant exposures were higher. In contrast, tree
density was associated with reduced asthma hospitalisation when pollutant exposures were higher but had no
significant association when pollutant exposures were lower.
Conclusions: We found differential effects of natural environments at high and low background pollutant con-
centrations. These findings can provide evidence for urban planning decisions which aim to leverage health co-
benefits from environmental improvements.
1. Introduction
Asthma is a chronic inflammatory condition of the airways of the
lungs which causes hyper-responsiveness to specific triggers, and leads
to a variety of respiratory symptoms (GINA, 2017). Persistent low-level
symptoms can be exacerbated by exposure to stressors such as influ-
enza, air pollution and environmental allergens. In the UK, 18% of
adults report asthma in the previous 12 months (To et al., 2012), and
symptoms are reported by 21% of 6–7 year olds and 25% of 13–14 year
olds (Asher et al., 2000). Over 5.4 million people are currently re-
ceiving treatment in the UK, at an annual cost to the National Health
Service of around £1 billion (www.asthma.org.uk).
Exposure to higher levels of outdoor air pollutants such as nitrogen
dioxide (NO2), particulate matter < 2.5 μm (PM2.5) and sulphur di-
oxide (SO2) has been associated with the onset of wheeze and asthma in
pre-school infants (Clark et al., 2010), school-aged children (Khreis
et al., 2017; Gasana et al., 2012) and adults (Anderson et al., 2013).
Exacerbation in those who already have asthma has also been linked to
exposure to outdoor air pollution. For example, short-term increases in
pollutant exposure are associated with increased asthma symptoms and
asthma-related emergency room visits (Zheng et al., 2015; Weinmayr
et al., 2010); and long-term background pollutant exposure is asso-
ciated with increased asthma-related hospitalisations (Roberts et al.,
2012). Indoor air quality (alongside other indoor environmental fac-
tors) is also important for asthma prevalence (Kanchongkittiphon et al.,
2015).

MARK
 The potential for vegetation to mitigate the negative health impacts
of air pollution has received considerable interest from urban planners
(Escobedo et al., 2011). Trees and plants reduce ambient particulate
concentrations by capturing particles on their leaf surfaces (Wuyts
et al., 2008; Roy et al., 2012), and leaf stomata can absorb gaseous
pollutants (Chaparro-Suareza et al., 2011). Models of urban area air-
sheds (ground to atmospheric boundary layer) suggest that reductions
in particulates from deposition on urban trees are modest (Tallis et al.,
2011). Importantly, however, localised improvements to air quality for
those living in close proximity to urban trees may be both much higher
and of medical significance (McDonald et al., 2016). Trees can also
influence wind turbulence and thus the dispersion of air pollutants
(Janhäll, 2015). Urban trees may increase pollutant concentrations in
some street canyon configurations (Salmond et al., 2013; Vos et al.,
2013), but reduce pollutant concentrations when winds are parallel to
street canyons (Amorim et al., 2013; Abhijith and Gokhale, 2015).
The potential impacts on asthma of tree cover and green spaces in
general are further complicated by their generation of allergenic pollen.
Even though not all asthmatics react to pollen, short-term variation in
local pollen concentrations is associated with allergy medication pur-
chases (Ito et al., 2015), asthma symptoms (DellaValle et al., 2012), and
asthma-related emergency department visits (Ito et al., 2015; Jariwala
et al., 2011; Orazzo et al., 2009). Moreover, there is evidence from
laboratory and field experiments to suggest that environmental air
pollutant and allergenic pollen exposures may interact (Motta et al.,
2006; Ghiani et al., 2012). For example, studies show that NO2 can
impact on pollen morphology (Chassard et al., 2015; Zhao et al., 2015),
as well as change the pollen protein content or protein release pro-
cesses, although effects are species and concentration dependent (Frank
and Ernst, 2016). There is also evidence that grass pollen allergen
molecules can bind to other fine particles in polluted air and become
concentrated (Namork et al., 2006). In addition, airways damaged by
air pollutant exposure may be more susceptible to hyper-responsiveness
with allergen exposure (D'Amato et al., 2010). Consistent with these
mechanisms, there is evidence of the interactive effects of pollen and
other aeroallergens with air pollutants on increased hospitalisation for
asthma (Cakmak et al., 2012; Hebbern and Cakmak, 2014).
The net effects of urban trees and green spaces on asthma exacer-
bation are likely therefore to result from opposing influences which are
not easily separated in empirical investigation, and are necessarily
compounded in the experience of asthma sufferers in their contacts
with natural environments. Indeed, a wider variety of exacerbating and
mitigating environmental factors than those discussed above may be
involved. Even as they remove particulate and gaseous pollutants,
urban woodlands and green spaces may reduce air quality through the
emission of biogenic volatile organic compounds which contribute to
the formation of ozone (Domm et al., 2008). Effects on asthmatics may
also result from exposure to fungal spores and moulds (Sharpe et al.,
2014), saprophytic bacteria and polyphenolic compounds (Rook,
2013). Exposure to natural environments may also impact on asthma
through effects on human skin proteobacteria, which can in turn affect
atopic sensitisation (Ruokolainen et al., 2015). In addition, green space
can promote physical activity and reduce stress (Hartig et al., 2014),
which may in turn reduce the risk of asthma attacks, given the potential
for overweight/obesity (Beuther et al., 2006) and stress (Vliagoftis,
2014) to exacerbate the condition.
Few studies have investigated the net effect of these multiple and
potentially conflicting influences of urban trees and green space on
asthma. Findings from the limited previous investigations are incon-
sistent, possibly due to differences between studies in the spatial re-
solution or local characteristics of vegetation, or in asthma outcome
measure, sampled population, or covariate controls. Individual level
analyses of the effects of green land cover measures on asthma out-
comes have suggested beneficial (Maas et al., 2009; Sbihi et al., 2015),
null (Lovasi et al., 2013; Dadvand et al., 2014; Andrusaityte et al.,
2016) and even harmful relationships (Lovasi et al., 2013; Dadvand
et al., 2014; Andrusaityte et al., 2016); ecological level analyses have
suggested both beneficial (Ayres-Sampaio et al., 2014; Erdman et al.,
2015; Lovasi et al., 2008) and null relationships (Ayres-Sampaio et al.,
2014; Erdman et al., 2015; Lovasi et al., 2008; Pilat et al., 2012).
Importantly, previous studies are generally at relatively low spatial
resolution (leading to imprecision in exposure estimation) and there are
almost no examples of large population studies which relate asthma
surveillance data at high geographic resolution with local natural en-
vironment characteristics. The current study aimed to address this issue
by examining emergency hospitalisations for asthma in a small-area
ecological analysis of all urban residential areas in England and testing
associations with two green space land use measures (neighbourhood
green space and domestic gardens) and with tree density. Furthermore,
we also recognised the importance of potential interactions between
natural environment and air pollutant exposures, driven by processes of
pollutant deposition, pollutant dispersion, pollen allergen development
and the bio-availability of pollen allergens, as well as direct synergistic
exposure effects for asthma sufferers. We therefore aimed to examine
not only how asthma hospitalisations are associated with natural en-
vironments when adjusted for the effects of air pollutants, but also how
the associations between hospitalisations and natural environment ex-
posure might vary at different levels of air pollutant exposure. An un-
derstanding of these relationships is needed to inform targeted inter-
ventions, public health policies and urban planning.
2. Methods
2.1. Overview
English Hospital Episode Statistics (http://www.content.digital.nhs.
uk/hes) were used in a cross-sectional ecological analysis to examine
associations between emergency hospitalisations for asthma (ICD-10
J45/J46), natural environments and background air pollutant con-
centrations. Hospitalisations (n = 660,505) for the study period 1st
April 1997 to 31st March 2012 amongst residents of urban areas in
England were summed by geographical areas called ‘Lower-layer Super
Output Areas’ (LSOAs, defined by the UK government for statistical
reporting for England). LSOAs encompass similar sized populations and
have a mean physical area of c. 0.9 km2 in urban areas (n = 26,455,
with a total population in 2001 of c. 41M). Period (1997–2012) po-
pulation standardised emergency hospitalisations for asthma for each
urban LSOA were linked to other data at LSOA level, specifically: area
level measures of public green spaces, domestic gardens and tree cover
(collectively referred to as ‘natural environments’ henceforth); air pol-
lution; and Indices of Deprivation (IOD). Negative binomial regression
models were used to explore associations between asthma and these
factors. Analyses were performed in Stata 14 (StataCorp, College
Station TX).
2.2. Asthma data
Standardised hospitalisation rates for asthma (1997–2012) were
calculated for each urban LSOA from the area total hospitalisations and
from data on the (2001) area population size. Using data on the (2001)
age structure of the population of each of the LSOAs, a direct stan-
dardisation was undertaken of these LSOA crude rates, to the 2013
European Standard Population (ESP). These standardised hospitalisa-
tion rates (per 100,000 ESP, referred to as the ‘asthma rate’ henceforth)
enabled comparison between areas.
2.3. Natural environment data
Two measures of ‘natural’ environment density, 1) LSOA percentage
of green space and 2) LSOA percentage of gardens, were derived from
the
Generalised
Land
Use
Database
(GLUD,
Department
for
Communities and Local Government, 2007), which divides the total
I. Alcock et al.
Environment International 109 (2017) 29–41
30
 land in each LSOA into nine categories of use: green space; domestic
gardens; freshwater; domestic buildings; non-domestic buildings; roads;
paths; railways and other (largely hard standing). GLUD data were
collected in 2005 and were then accurate to approximately 10 m2.
Within urban areas, green space is largely publicly accessible, whereas
gardens are largely privately owned. Regression models were specified
to estimate the change in the asthma dependent variable associated
with a percentage point increase in green space and in gardens; it is
important to note that such a percentage point increase involves a
corresponding percentage point decrease in the omitted reference ca-
tegory, comprising all land uses that are not green space or gardens (i.e.
the classes of built land use listed above and water).
A third natural environment measure used was the density of ma-
ture (i.e. over 3 m high) trees, or closely grouped tree crowns where
clustered canopies were at the same height. This variable was derived
from tree count data obtained from the Bluesky International National
Tree
Map
(www.emapsite.com/downloads/product_guides/NTM-
Specification.pdf) by aggregating 25 m raster data to LSOA bound-
aries using ArcGIS (ESRI, Redlands CA). Tree density was calculated
from tree count and LSOA surface area data. A scale point increase on
the tree density scale represents an increase of 50 trees/clustered
crowns per km2. The green space and gardens land use categories are
mutually exclusive (i.e. land parcels are one, or the other, or neither),
whereas the tree density measure ‘cuts across’ the land use classifica-
tion, in that tree density is derived for all land, irrespective of its land
use classification.
2.4. Air pollution data
Period mean levels of modelled background concentrations of NO2,
SO2 and PM2.5 at 1 × 1 km spatial resolution (available online from
DEFRA https://uk-air.defra.gov.uk/data/pcm-data) were aggregated by
areal
interpolation
to
LSOAs
using
the
Geospatial
Modelling
Environment/ArcGIS (www.spatialecology.com). The outdoor back-
ground air pollution data were obtained from Pollution Climate
Mapping (PCM) model simulations. PCM is based on dispersion mod-
elling techniques, national atmospheric emission inventory data, me-
teorological data and terrain characteristics (Brookes et al., 2016). It
has been calibrated using measurements from the Automatic Urban and
Rural Network (AURN) of air quality monitoring sites. Due to limita-
tions in the data available from DEFRA, the range of years over which
mean concentrations could be derived did not include the early years of
the 1997–2012 period, and also varied slightly between pollutants: NO2
μg/m3 2001–2012; SO2 μg/m3 2002–2012; PM2.5 μg/m3 2002–2012.
To avoid the implication that the modelled pollutant data has the ac-
curacy of measured data, quintiles of the period mean outdoor back-
ground air pollutant concentrations in urban LSOAs were used as in-
dependent variables in the regression models. The use of quintiles also
allowed non-linear relationships to be evident. (Ozone was not ex-
amined in this study since the DEFRA annual summary data gave the
number of days exceeding 120 μg/m3, rather than detailed information
on background concentration levels.)
Given that people spend on average 70% of their time in their own
homes (Lader et al., 2006), their exposure to residential area outdoor
air pollution is, arguably, heavily influenced by the extent of its pene-
tration of domestic buildings. For use in a sensitivity analysis, the urban
LSOA mean outdoor concentrations were adjusted to account for the
ratio of NO2, SO2 and PM2.5 from outdoor sources estimated to pene-
trate indoors, based on domestic housing types within each LSOA.
Briefly, concentrations of outdoor pollution penetrating indoors depend
on the airtightness of the dwelling; the dwelling built form, including
exposed surface area and internal volume; wind exposure; occupant
ventilation behaviour; and deposition and penetration behaviour of the
pollutants. Spatial variation of housing and surrounding environment
may therefore lead to regional variations in exposure to outdoor pol-
lution indoors. To account for this, we employed building physics
estimates of indoor/outdoor ratio of NO2, SO2 and PM2.5 from outdoor
sources only for over 1 million individual dwellings across the UK in the
Homes Energy Efficiency Database, averaged for each LSOA (Taylor
et al., 2016). These adjusted pollutant measures will be referred to as
‘penetrating pollutants’ to distinguish them from the outdoor background
concentrations used in the main analysis; quintiles of the period mean
penetrating pollutant concentrations were derived. Although they are
likely to be important contributors to indoor pollution exposure, pol-
lution from indoor sources and other indoor environment factors are
excluded from this sensitivity analysis.
The interval scale measures of NO2 and PM2.5 had a Pearson cor-
relation coefficient of 0.82, and the quintile categories showed a sub-
stantial degree of overlap (see Appendix, Part 1). Therefore, to avoid
estimates being biased by collinearity, the NO2 and PM2.5 categories
were not included simultaneously in the same model. Regression
models estimated effects of both NO2 and SO2 in combination and
PM2.5 and SO2 in combination; and then the findings were compared.
2.5. Socio-economic deprivation and region control variables
Socio-economic deprivation is strongly associated with asthma
(Uphoff et al., 2015) and was controlled for using data from the English
Indices of Deprivation (IOD) 2007, which are Census based statistics at
LSOA level compiled from 2005 data (Noble et al., 2008). Principal
components analysis was carried out of indices across five domains of
deprivation: income; employment; education; barriers to housing and
services; and risk of crime. Two IOD domains were not included:
health/disability and living environment. The former included hospital
admission rates in its component indicators, and therefore risked con-
flation with the dependent variable; the latter included air quality in its
component indicators, and therefore risked conflation with the air
pollution variables of interest. Two principal components had eigen-
values above 1, which together explained 0.818 of the variance in the
indices, and scores on these deprivation components, referred to as DC1
and DC2, were included in regression models as covariate controls.
Although data on smoking prevalence rates were not available, the
deprivation control variables limit any bias to estimates which may be
due to differential exposure to tobacco smoke, a major cause of asthma
exacerbation, since area smoking rates in the UK increase as depriva-
tion increases (Wise, 2014). Categorical variables identifying Govern-
ment Office Region (GOR), 9 large regions of England, were also in-
cluded in regression models to control for potential regional variation
in, for example, climate and health care culture. Although we have no
direct data on area rates of diagnosed versus undiagnosed asthma, or
adherence to prescribed medication regimes, differences in health care
culture across regions and socio-economic strata are believed to be a
principal mechanism for relationships between asthma and deprivation,
and our covariate controls are designed to limit bias from this source.
2.6. Statistical analysis
In a series of models, negative binomial regression using maximum
likelihood estimation was used to estimate the effects of natural en-
vironments and air pollutants on the rate of asthma hospitalisations.
One series of models included NO2 and SO2; another series included
PM2.5 and SO2. Using the nbreg command in STATA 14 software, a
negative binomial distribution (and log link function) was specified to
account for over-dispersion due to unobserved heterogeneity in the
hospitalisation rate data. Standard errors were estimated using the
Huber/White/sandwich estimator, which is robust to heteroscedasticity
in error terms.
Before examining how the associations between asthma and natural
environments might vary with coexisting air pollution, initial ex-
ploratory analyses examined: 1) the direct (unadjusted) effects of the
natural environments and the three air pollutant variables with ad-
justment for the deprivation and GOR covariates (i.e., models with only
I. Alcock et al.
Environment International 109 (2017) 29–41
31
 one predictor-of-interest were specified, referred to as ‘single predictor
models’); and 2) the combined effects of natural environments and air
pollutants with mutual adjustment and with adjustment for the depri-
vation and GOR covariates (i.e., two multivariable predictors-of-in-
terest models were specified, referred to as the ‘multivariable model,
NO2/SO2’ and the ‘multivariable model, PM2.5/SO2’, to show the effects
of the three natural environments, NO2/PM2.5 and SO2 when they were
simultaneously mutually adjusted).
The main analysis examined the effects of natural environments on
asthma rate at different levels of background air pollutant exposure.
Following examination of descriptive statistics and the correlations
between predictors, our final model, referred to as the ‘PM2.5/SO2
model with interaction terms’, was developed from simpler models by the
inclusion of further blocks of interaction terms to account for correla-
tions amongst predictors, informed by test statistics and comparisons of
model fit. Asthma rate was regressed against pollutant quintiles (NO2/
PM2.5; SO2); natural environments (green space; gardens; trees); de-
privation components 1 and 2; GOR; all two way natural environment
by pollutant quintile interactions; the NO2/PM2.5 by SO2 two way in-
teraction; all two way interactions and the three way interaction be-
tween natural environments; all two way pollutant quintile by depri-
vation component interactions; all two way natural environment by
deprivation component interactions, i.e., the following model:

Results are expressed for our variables of interest as average
marginal effects, which report derivatives of the response. This ap-
proach to the communication of findings is particularly helpful where
models include interaction terms. With the categorical pollutant quin-
tiles, the average marginal effects measure discrete change, i.e., how
the mean predicted hospitalisation rate changes as the variable changes
from the 1st to other pollutant quintiles, with all other variables held as
observed. With the interval scale natural environment variables, the
average marginal effects measure the instantaneous rate of change,
which is an approximation of the effect on the mean predicted hospi-
talisation rate of a one unit increase in the measures, with all other
variables held as observed. In the models with interaction terms be-
tween pollutant quintiles and natural environment measures, the
average marginal effects of the natural environment measures were
further calculated conditional on the values of the pollutant quintiles.
The sensitivity of results from the models with interaction terms was
examined including only those aged 15–79 in the calculation of the
hospitalisation rate, as children and older adults may be especially
vulnerable to health risks associated with air pollution (Makri and
Stilianakis, 2008). Further supplementary analyses examined the sen-
sitivity of the findings from models with interaction terms to the sub-
stitution of background pollutant concentration quintiles for quintiles
of penetrating pollutant concentration (referred to as ‘penetrating NO2’;
‘penetrating SO2’ and ‘penetrating PM2.5’; see Section 2.4 above). Both
the NO2/SO2 and the PM2.5/SO2 models with interaction terms were
re-specified using these adjusted background concentration measures.
3. Results
Descriptive data on the asthma rate and the natural environment
variables for the urban LSOAs are presented in Table 1. The asthma rate
varied greatly across urban LSOAs, ranging from 0 to nearly 20,000. On
average, approximately a third of land cover was used for green space,
with an additional 29% used for gardens. The average number of ma-
ture trees per km2 within urban LSOAs was 581 (11.62 × 50). De-
scriptive data on pollutant concentrations in the quintile categories are
presented in Table 2. (Further data on the variables used in this study
are given in the Appendix.)
Results from the three stages of regression modelling are presented
for the natural environment and air pollutant variables of interest
(average marginal effects estimates for covariate control variables are
not reported). Regression results for natural environment variables are
expressed as associations with a 1 unit increase in predictors (1% green
space; 1% gardens; 50 trees/km2). Regressions were also specified using
Table 1

These alternative presentations of the results allow different compar-
isons of effects across the three classes of natural environment: unit
increases reflect the types of choices facing urban planners, whereas
S.D. increases reflect equivalent relative increases across the three
classes. Results for air pollutant quintiles show the effects of a category
change from the least polluted quintile (quintile 1) to other categories.
3.1. Single predictor models
Results from the single predictor-of-interest models are presented in
Table 3. Increases in all three natural environments were associated
with decreases in the asthma rate. The effects on the asthma rate of S.D.
increases in green space and gardens were similar to each other and
greater than the reduction associated with trees. Whilst increased
asthma rate was associated with NO2 and PM2.5 at quintile 5 compared
to quintile 1, there was no clear evidence of trend across the quintiles.
For SO2, whilst there was evidence of a higher asthma rate in areas in
quintiles 3 and 4 compared to quintile 1, there was no clear trend.
3.2. Multivariable predictors-of-interest models
Results from the NO2/SO2 and PM2.5/SO2 versions of the multi-
variable model are presented in Table 4. The three natural environ-
ments remained associated with reduced asthma rate with mutual ad-
justment and adjustment for the effects of air pollutants in these
models, though compared to the single predictor models, the associated
asthma reductions were smaller. The effects of natural environments
(and SO2) were broadly consistent in both versions of the multivariable
model. The patterns of association of pollutant quintiles with asthma
rate in the NO2 and PM2.5 versions of the multivariable model were
consistent with those observed in the single predictor models.
3.3. Models with interaction terms
Estimates of the average marginal effects of predictors from the
NO2/SO2 and PM2.5/SO2 versions of the model with interaction terms
are presented in Table 5. The three natural environments remained
associated with reduced asthma rate when adjusting for their interac-
tions with pollutants in addition to their main effects, and when ac-
counting for other interactions amongst predictors. The magnitude of
these associated reductions in asthma rate was highly consistent in the
NO2/SO2 and PM2.5/SO2 versions of the model with interaction terms.
Of more interest, however, than the average change in asthma rate
associated with increases in natural environment and background air
pollutant exposure, are the changes in rate associated with increases in
natural environment exposure at different levels of air pollutant ex-
posure. Plots of the marginal effects of natural environments at each
NO2 and SO2 pollutant quintile, derived from the NO2/SO2 model with
interaction terms, are presented in Figs. 1 and 2 respectively; as with
previous presentations, results are shown for both a scale point increase
and a 1 S.D. increase in natural environments. Plots of the average
marginal effects of natural environments at each PM2.5 and SO2 pol-
lutant quintile, derived from the PM2.5/SO2 model with interaction
terms, are presented in Figs. 3 and 4 respectively. (The results illu-
strated in Figs. 1–4 are tabulated in the Appendix. Pairwise Wald tests
of equivalence of marginal effects of natural environments conditional
on pollutant quintiles were carried out and results are also presented in
the Appendix; unadjusted p values and p values with Bonferroni ad-
justment for ten comparisons are displayed.)
In the NO2/SO2 model with interaction terms, green space was

 between the environments and the asthma rate at different NO2 quin-

rate at all PM2.5 quintiles, though the effect for gardens was non-sig-
nificant at the 5th quintile (Fig. 3). There was no evidence of trend in
effects of green space and gardens across the PM2.5 quintiles (Tables

and 5th PM2.5 quintiles (Fig. 3) and effects at the 5th quintile were
significantly different from effects at all less polluted quintiles (Table
A18). Green space and gardens were also associated with reduced
asthma rate at all SO2 quintiles, though effects were non-significant at
the 3rd quintile (Fig. 4), with no evidence of trend across the quintiles
(Tables A19, A20). Trees were associated with reduced asthma rate
with SO2 at the 3rd–5th quintiles (Fig. 4) with effects at the 4th and 5th
quintiles significantly different from the 1st and 2nd quintiles (Table

3.4. Sensitivity analyses
A supplementary analysis tested the robustness of the findings from
NO2/SO2 and PM2.5/SO2 models with interaction terms to the inclu-
sion of emergency asthma hospitalisations only amongst the 15–79 age
group. Substantive findings on changes in hospitalisations associated
with increases in natural environment exposure at different levels of air
pollutant exposure (see Section 3.3 above) were replicated (see

 Appendix, Figs. A1–A4).
A further sensitivity analysis explored the robustness of the findings
from the models with interaction terms to re-specification using quin-
tiles of penetrating air pollutants (see Section 2.4 above): penetrating
NO2 and penetrating SO2 in the NO2/SO2 model with interaction terms,
and penetrating PM2.5 and penetrating SO2 in the PM2.5/SO2 version.
Full results of these robustness checks are presented in Appendix, where
relevant descriptive statistics are also given. Despite substantial dif-
ferences in the ranking of LSOAs between the pollutant quintiles used in
the main analysis and the penetrating pollutant quintiles used in this
sensitivity analysis (Tables A26–A28), the interactions observed be-
tween the natural environments and the pollutants (Figs. 1–4) were
largely consistent with those observed in the sensitivity analyses be-
tween the natural environments and the penetrating pollutants (Figs.
A5–A8).
In the penetrating NO2/SO2 model, green space and gardens were
associated with significantly reduced asthma rate at all NO2 quintiles
except at the 5th (most polluted) quintile, where their associations were
non-significant (Fig. A5). However, in contrast to the main model, the
differences in effects of green space between the 5th and 1st–3rd
quintiles were significant (Table A31) and differences in effects of
gardens between the 5th and 1st–3rd quintiles were significant or
marginally significant (Table A32). Trees were associated with sig-
nificantly reduced asthma rate at the 3rd–5th NO2 quintiles (Fig. A5)

 and there were significant differences in effects between the 5th and
1st–3rd and between the 4th and 1st–2nd quintiles (Table A33). As in
the main model, green space was associated with reduced asthma rate
at all SO2 quintiles (Fig. A6) and there was no evidence of trend (Table
A34). Gardens were associated with reduced asthma rate at the 3rd–5th
SO2 quintiles, and trees at the 2nd–5th quintiles (Fig. A6) though there
were no significant differences in effects (Tables A35, A36).
In the penetrating PM2.5/SO2 model, green space was associated
with reduced asthma rate at the 1st–4th PM2.5 quintile (Fig. A7) and
differences in effects between the 5th and the 2nd/4th quintiles were
significant (Table A37). Gardens were associated with reduced asthma
rate at the 1st, 2nd and 4th PM2.5 quintiles (Fig. A7) and the difference
in effects between the 5th and 2nd quintiles was significant (Table
A38). Trees were associated with reduced hospitalisations at the 4th/
5th PM2.5 quintiles (Fig. A7) and differences in effect between the 5th
and 1st–3rd and between the 4th and 1st–2nd quintiles were significant
or marginally significant (Table A39). Green space and gardens were
associated with reduced asthma rate at all SO2 quintiles (Fig. A8), with
no evidence of trend across the quintiles (Tables A40, A41), whilst trees
were associated with reduced asthma rate at the 2nd–5th SO2 quintiles
and all contrasts with the 1st quintile were significant (Table A42).
4. Discussion
This is the first large scale epidemiological analysis to relate re-
sidential area natural environments to asthma in England. Regional

 studies are important in this field: since vegetation varies geo-
graphically, the net effects of the multiple mechanisms by which ex-
posure to natural environments may impact on asthma may not be
easily inferred from one region to another. This cross-sectional study
found that the rate of emergency hospitalisation for asthma in urban
residential areas of England was significantly related to land used for
green space and for gardens, and also to tree density. On average, these
natural environments were associated with reduced hospitalisation.
However, this association varied by pollutant exposure.
Generalising across the findings from estimates which controlled on
background concentrations of pollutants and also controlled on the
penetration of housing by background concentrations of pollutants, this
study found that increases in tree density were associated with greater
reductions in asthma hospitalisation when NO2, PM2.5 and SO2 were
higher (and had no benefit when they were very low). In contrast, there
was some (limited) evidence that increases in green space and gardens
were associated with greater reductions in asthma hospitalisation when
NO2 and PM2.5 exposure were lower. Interestingly, across all levels of
air pollutant exposure, there was little difference in how asthma
emergency rates were associated with residential area green space,
which tends to be publicly accessible, and gardens, which tend to be
privately owned.
This study design cannot indicate the potential mechanisms that
may be involved in the associations between natural environments and
asthma and how they are changed by specific pollutant exposures.
However, these findings raise the possibility that whilst urban green
space and gardens have generally beneficial associations with asthma
hospitalisation, their production of pollen might reduce any benefit
when pollutant exposures are very high. This could be due to sy-
nergistic effects of pollutants and pollens on asthma exacerbation
(D'Amato et al., 2010) and/or the effects of air pollutants on the
bioavailability of pollen allergens (Ghiani et al., 2012; Chassard et al.,
2015; Zhao et al., 2015; Namork et al., 2006). Trees can also produce
allergenic pollen but the results do not suggest that these mechanisms
are affecting the relationship between trees and asthma exacerbation.
Rather, the findings suggest that the mechanisms dominating the re-
lationship between trees and asthma are pollutant removal and dis-
persion. A review of measured differences in particulate matter con-
centration upwind and downwind of urban street trees and hedges
suggested a reduction of 24% is typical in these settings (McDonald
et al., 2016). Removal rates of many pollutants by trees are a linear
function of ambient concentrations, so particulate deposition rates, for
example, are higher when concentrations are higher. This would ex-
plain the greater reductions in asthma hospitalisations which are as-
sociated with increases in tree density in more polluted areas. The fact
that shorter vegetation traps particles through dry deposition far less
efficiently than trees (Fowler et al., 2004; Freer-Smith et al., 2005),
combined with possible interaction of pollutants and grass pollen,
might explain our findings suggest greater reductions in asthma hos-
pitalisation are associated with increases in green space in less polluted
areas.
4.1. Strengths and weaknesses
A major strength of this analysis is the size and breadth of the data
collected. We used a 15-year long cross-section of 660,505 asthma
emergency hospitalisations from urban areas of England, which re-
sulted in a statistically powerful sample. By focussing on severe asthma
events, we reduced the likelihood of outcome misclassification, espe-
cially when self-reported asthma status is prone to include wheezing
during childhood (Scott et al., 2011) and COPD in adulthood
(Abramson et al., 2014). Our area-level measures of gardens and tree
cover are more precise indicators of exposure to the natural environ-
ment than remotely sensed measures, such as the Normalised Difference
Vegetation Index which has been used in most previous research. The
natural environment measures also show how subtypes of green space
may have important associations with specific health outcomes, in
addition to general health found previously (Wheeler et al., 2015).
Importantly, this is the first study to consider how the association be-
tween the natural environment and asthma varies with coexisting air
pollution. Whilst we considered traffic related air pollutants (NO2 and
PM2.5), affecting a large proportion of urban populations, we also
considered SO2 (mainly produced by industrial processes), and af-
fecting smaller pockets of urban and rural populations. Additionally, we
investigated whether the associations differ by indoor penetration rates,
addressing a methodological weakness in previous work.
The environmental variables used in this work are assumed to be
indicative of group exposures to natural environments and air pollu-
tion. They have analogues at the individual level but these are not
easily operationalised and measured. Whilst ubiquitous background air
pollution is commonly operationalised as an affliction of a population
in the aggregate, rather than of its individuals, and whilst ecologic
(population level) effects are the central concern for policy makers, an
ecological study design is prone to misclassification of an individual's
true exposure due to area aggregation, and therefore this study is not
appropriate to make causal inferences. Furthermore, we have not ex-
amined the extent to which the results are sensitive to size of the area
used for aggregation (i.e. LSOA) and caution is warranted if interpreting
the results on a different spatial scale. Despite accounting for the indoor
penetration of background outdoor air pollutants, exposure to pollu-
tants from indoor sources has not been accounted for in this work. Our
analysis of an extended period cross-section provides ‘static’ measures
of what are in reality dynamic processes and the approach does not
allow us to see any seasonal or secular trends in how asthma emer-
gencies relate to interaction effects between natural environment and
air pollutant exposures. Our use of deprivation and natural environ-
ment measures collected at points within the period, rather than
averages across the period, means we do not account for within-area
change in these factors but any bias resulting from this will be ex-
tremely slight since within-area differences over the period will be
negligible in comparison to between area differences.
4.2. Potential policy implications
The differential effects of green space and trees at both very high
and very low pollutant levels have implications for urban planning
policy which aims to leverage health co-benefits from environmental
improvements. Our findings support other work (Rao et al., 2014) in
suggesting that the respiratory health of populations in highly polluted
urban areas can be improved by the expansion of tree cover. However,
our work calls into question whether similar improvement is likely to
follow from the expansion of open green space, such as pasture, or of
gardens in these highly polluted areas. Our results further suggest the
possibility that the respiratory health of populations in urban areas with
very low air pollution can, in contrast to highly polluted areas, be im-
proved by the expansion of gardens and green spaces and that this may
be more beneficial than the expansion of tree coverage in these areas.
However, we acknowledge that ecological analyses of the type pre-
sented in this work are fundamentally exploratory and therefore that
these suggestions are speculative. Further evidence is needed to inform
planning policy, ideally from longitudinal individual level studies.
