indices of health and body composition – a
crossover trial in resistance-trained men

Abstract
Background: Eight weeks of a high protein diet (>3 g/kg/day) coupled with a periodized heavy resistance training
program has been shown to positively affect body composition with no deleterious effects on health. Using a
randomized, crossover design, resistance-trained male subjects underwent a 16-week intervention (i.e., two 8-week
periods) in which they consumed either their normal (i.e., habitual) or a higher protein diet (>3 g/kg/day). Thus, the
purpose of this study was to ascertain if significantly increasing protein intake would affect clinical markers of
health (i.e., lipids, kidney function, etc.) as well as performance and body composition in young males with
extensive resistance training experience.
Methods: Twelve healthy resistance-trained men volunteered for this study (mean ± SD: age 25.9 ± 3.7 years; height
178.0 ± 8.5 cm; years of resistance training experience 7.6 ± 3.6) with 11 subjects completing most of the
assessments. In a randomized crossover trial, subjects were tested at baseline and after two 8-week treatment
periods (i.e., habitual [normal] diet and high protein diet) for body composition, measures of health (i.e., blood
lipids, comprehensive metabolic panel) and performance. Each subject maintained a food diary for the 16-week
treatment period (i.e., 8 weeks on their normal or habitual diet and 8 weeks on a high protein diet). Each subject
provided a food diary of two weekdays and one weekend day per week. In addition, subjects kept a diary of their
training regimen that was used to calculate total work performed.
Results: During the normal and high protein phase of the treatment period, subjects consumed 2.6 ± 0.8 and
3.3 ± 0.8 g/kg/day of dietary protein, respectively. The mean protein intake over the 4-month period was
2.9 ± 0.9 g/kg/day. The high protein group consumed significantly more calories and protein (p < 0.05) than
the normal protein group. There were no differences in dietary intake between the groups for any other
measure. Moreover, there were no significant changes in body composition or markers of health in either
group. There were no side effects (i.e., blood lipids, glucose, renal, kidney function etc.) regarding high
protein consumption.
Conclusion: In resistance-trained young men who do not significantly alter their training regimen, consuming
a high protein diet (2.6 to 3.3 g/kg/day) over a 4-month period has no effect on blood lipids or markers of
renal and hepatic function. Nor were there any changes in performance or body composition. This is the first
crossover trial using resistance-trained subjects in which the elevation of protein intake to over four times the
recommended dietary allowance has shown no harmful effects.

 Background
There is a dearth of studies that have examined the ef-
fects of high protein diets on markers of health, body
composition or performance. The International Society
of Sports Nutrition’s Position Stand on Protein states
that “protein intakes of 1.4–2.0 g/kg/day for physically
active individuals is not only safe, but may improve the
training adaptations to exercise training” [1]. Previous
work from our laboratory examined a true high protein
diet (4.4 g/kg/day) on measures of body composition
and performance. In essence, consuming over five times
the recommended daily allowance of protein had no
effect on body composition in resistance-trained individ-
uals who otherwise maintained the same training regi-
men. That investigation was the first interventional
study to demonstrate that consuming a hypercaloric,
high protein diet does not result in changes in body
composition [2]. A follow-up investigation on resistance-
trained men and women found that when a high protein
diet is combined with a periodized heavy resistance
training program, there is a subsequent loss of fat mass.
Furthermore, no side effects were found via a basic
metabolic panel (i.e., blood chemistry measures). Thus,
the purpose of the present investigation was to deter-
mine the effects of a high protein diet (>3 g/kg/day) in
resistance-trained males with extensive weight-training
experience. This is the first randomized, crossover trial
on high protein diets. In addition, we have performed a
more extensive examination of its effects on other
markers of metabolic health (i.e., blood lipids and com-
prehensive metabolic panel).
Methods
Participants
Twelve resistance-trained male subjects volunteered for
this investigation. Subjects took part in a randomized
crossover trial in which they consumed their habitual
(i.e., normal protein) or high protein diet for two 8-week
periods. Thus, there was a total treatment period of
16 weeks (i.e., 8 weeks on normal or high followed by
8 weeks on the opposite diet). Subjects came to the la-
boratory on three occasions: baseline, week 8 and week
16. The extra protein consumed by each subject was
obtained primarily from whey protein powder. All
procedures involving human subjects were approved
by Nova Southeastern University’s Human Subjects
Institutional Review Board in accordance with the
Helsinki Declaration and written informed consent
was obtained prior to participation.
Food diary
Subjects kept a diary (i.e., three days per week for the
16 week period; two weekdays and one weekend day) of
their food intake via a smartphone app (MyFitnessPal®).
The use of mobile apps for dietary self-reporting has
been previously used [3]. Every subject had previously
used this mobile app. The MyFitnessPal® app is a data-
base comprised of over 5 million foods that have been
provided by users via entering data manually or by scan-
ning the bar code on packaged goods. Thus, the data
themselves are primarily derived from food labels (i.e.,
Nutrition Facts Panel) derived from the USDA National
Nutrient database. Thus, in order for subjects to con-
sume a high protein diet, protein powder (e.g., whey
protein) was provided at no cost to the research sub-
jects. However, they were not required to consume pro-
tein powder. The rest of their dietary protein was
obtained from their regular food intake.
Body composition
Height was measured using standard anthropometry and
total body weight was measured using a calibrated scale.
Body composition was assessed by whole body densitom-
etry using air displacement via the Bod Pod® (COSMED
USA, Concord CA). All testing was performed in accord-
ance with the manufacturer’s instructions. Subjects were
instructed to come into the lab after a 3-h fast and no ex-
ercise 24-h prior. They voided prior to testing. Subjects
were tested while wearing only tight fitting clothing
(swimsuit or undergarments) and an acrylic swim cap.
Subjects were instructed to wear the same clothing for all
testing. Thoracic gas volume was estimated for all subjects
using a predictive equation integral to the Bod Pod® soft-
ware. Each subject was tested at least twice per visit. The
calculated value for body density used the Siri equation to
estimate body composition. Data from the Bod Pod® in-
clude body weight, percent body fat, fat free mass and fat
mass. All testing was done with each subject at approxi-
mately the same time of day for each of the three testing
sessions. Although hydration status was not assessed, each
subject was tested in an identical manner throughout the
investigation. The Bod Pod was calibrated the morning of
the testing session as well as between each subject.
Performance testing
Performance testing included the one repetition max-
imum (1-RM) bench press and repetitions to failure
(RTF) at 60 % of the bench press 1-RM. Performance
tests were conducted by certified strength and condi-
tioning specialists and followed the NSCA’s guide to
tests and assessments [4]. All subjects were familiar with
the performance tests prior to entering the laboratory.
In general, each subject performed a movement specific
warm up prior to the test (i.e., 3 sets on the bench press
at progressively higher submaximal loads). Subjects then
rested for 2–3 min prior to commencing the 1-RM
bench press. A maximum of five attempts was attempted
for the 1-RM bench press. Once the subject achieved

Page 2 of 7
 their 1-RM, they rested for 3–5 min prior to com-
mencing the RTF at 60 % of the 1-RM bench press.
The maximal number of repetitions was subsequently
determined.
Blood analysis – comprehensive metabolic panel and
blood lipids
Subjects presented after an overnight fast at a local
Quest Diagnostics™ facility on three separate occasions.
A blood lipid and comprehensive metabolic panel was
done. This includes the following measures: glucose,
blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, glomerular filtra-
tion rate, BUN/creatinine ratio, sodium, potassium,
chloride, carbon dioxide, calcium, total protein, albumin,
globulin, albumin/globulin ratio, total bilirubin, alkaline
phosphatase, alanine transaminase, asparate transamin-
ase, total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein choles-
terol, triglycerides, low density lipoprotein cholesterol
and the total cholesterol to high density lipoprotein
cholesterol ratio. Quest Diagnostics performed each test
according to the standard operating procedure of the
company.
Training program
Each subject followed their own strength and condition-
ing program. The investigators were in regular contact
with each subject to ensure that each subject completed
a training log. The volume load (i.e., total weight lifted
per week) was determined for each 8-week period.
Statistics
A 2-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to
analyze the data with a p <0.05 considered significant.
Data are expressed as the mean ± SD. The statistical
analysis was completed using Prism 6 GraphPad Software
(La Jolla California).
Results
The characteristics of the 12 male subjects in this investi-
gation were as follows: [Mean ± SD]: age 25.9 ± 3.7 years;
height 178.0 ± 8.5 cm; years of resistance training experi-
ence 7.6 ± 3.6. We did not conduct normality of data
measures.
Body composition and performance
Body composition and performance data are presented
in Table 1 and Figs. 1, 2 and 3 (i.e., individual changes in
fat mass, FFM and % body fat). There were no signifi-
cant differences between the normal and high protein
groups for any of the measures.
Diet
There were significant differences in total energy and
protein intake between the high protein, normal protein
group and baseline (high > normal and baseline; p < 0.05)
(Table 2). The mean percentage of macronutrients
(CHO:PRO:Fat) were as follows: Baseline - 37:34:29,
Normal - 34:36:30 and High - 30:42:28 (Fig. 4).
Blood analysis
There were no changes in any of the variables regarding
blood lipids and a comprehensive metabolic panel
(Tables 3 and 4). We examined the two individuals
with the highest recorded protein intakes (4.66 and
6.59 g/kg/day) and found no deleterious effects on
renal function in either individual (Table 5).
Discussion
This is the third investigation from our laboratory
that has examined the effects of a high protein diet
(i.e., > 2 g/kg/day). Previously published work has
shown that consuming a high protein diet (4.4 g/kg/day)
does not significantly affect body composition (i.e., no sta-
tistically significant change in FFM, fat mass or % body
fat) in trained individuals who do not substantially change
their exercise regimen [2]. On the other hand, a follow-up
study found that a high protein diet (3.4 g/kg/d) in con-
junction with a periodized heavy resistance training pro-
gram can favorably alter body composition [5]. It should
be noted that although the previous investigation used
resistance-trained subjects, training experience varied
greatly. The current study used only highly experienced
resistance-trained males (i.e., ~8 years of training experi-
ence with a mean 1-RM bench press of 126 kg). They
could lift on average ~1.5 times their body weight. The
subjects in the current study also had more than twice the
resistance training experience as those in our prior investi-
gation [5].
Similar to our first investigation [2], the current study
found no statistically significant effects of a high protein

 diet on body composition, 1-RM bench press strength or
muscular endurance (RTF at 60 % of the 1-RM bench
press) when compared to the normal protein group. Al-
though our subjects consumed approximately 400 add-
itional calories daily for eight weeks, there were no
significant changes in fat mass despite the fact that there
were no changes in their exercise regimen.
With highly trained subjects, it is important that one
examine individual data points. Nine of 11 subjects dem-
onstrated a decrease in fat mass during the high protein
diet phase. Two subjects showed an increase in fat mass.
Relying on mean changes, particularly for trained sub-
jects, is not an ideal way to understand the adaptive
response to diet and/or exercise. Both mean and individ-
ual data points provide a much clearer picture of how
high protein intakes affect various measures. Certainly,
the small sample size (i.e., the study was underpowered)
is likely the reason for the lack of statistical significance
regarding fat mass. Nevertheless, the intriguing find-
ing in the current study is that overfeeding on pro-
tein does not typically have an adverse effect on body
composition.
The possible explanations for the lack of weight gain
in our subjects include the following: changes in the
thermic effect of exercise (TEE) as well as non-exercise
activity thermogenesis (NEAT) might account in part for
the slight decrease in percent body fat in the high pro-
tein diet group [6, 7]. Ostensibly, NEAT can vary by as
much as 2000 cal between individuals [7]. Thus, it is
possible that in our group of well-trained subjects,
NEAT could account for some of the additional energy
expenditure. In addition to NEAT, dietary protein itself
has profound thermic effect. Protein’s thermic effect of
feeding (TEF) is 19–23 % in both obese and lean individ-
uals whereas carbohydrate is approximately 12–14 % [8].
A high protein diet (45 % total kcal) elicits a 30 %
greater TEF than an isocaloric low protein (15 % total
kcal) in active females [9]. The subjects in our study did

 not alter fat or carbohydrate intake; thus, that could not
be an explanation for changes in body composition.
Thus, one might speculate that the high protein diet
group experienced a combination of enhanced TEF, TEE
and NEAT. Furthermore, recent animal data suggest that
a high-protein diet might reduce fat mass by inhibiting
lipogenesis in the liver [10].
In conjunction with our prior work, we further exam-
ined blood lipids as well as other markers of health. We
found no deleterious effects of high protein consump-
tion. There were no changes in blood lipids as well as
renal or hepatic function. On average, subjects in this in-
vestigation consumed ~3 g of protein per kilogram of
body weight daily for four months. In fact, the subjects
with the two highest levels of protein intake showed no
changes in renal function despite exceeding the RDA by
483–724 %. Thus, it is evident that even at very high
protein intakes, there are no harmful side effects.
It is worth noting that the fiber intake of our subjects
was 27–30 g per day. The average fiber intake in the
United States is 16 g per day [11]. Therefore, the notion
that a high protein diet and adequate fiber consumption

 is mutually exclusive is not supported by our data. One
might speculate the combination of higher protein and
fiber intake might assist in promoting fat loss [12]. Thus,
the fact that our subjects were healthy (i.e., blood lipids,
renal and hepatic function, etc.) may have been due par-
tially to their fiber intake. It is known that higher fiber
intakes are associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular
disease [13]. Furthermore, the cholesterol intake of our
subjects were as much as 160 % greater than the typical
recommendation of 300 mg per day [14]. Thus it is ap-
parent that in this select sample of highly trained males,
cholesterol intake has little effect on blood measures of
cardiovascular health.
The strengths of our investigation included the use of
highly trained subjects and the fact that we used a cross-
over design. Thus, each subject could be compared to
himself. The small sample size as well as the lack of con-
trol for the training program are certainly confounding
variables. Also, we did not ascertain the hydration status
of each subject. This could indeed affect our body com-
position assessment [15]. It is known that there may be
a decrease in FFM if the subject went from a hydrated
to a dehydrated state. To insure that this was minimized,
we did follow identical pre- and post-testing body com-
position procedures.
Conclusion
In conclusion, this is the first randomized crossover trial
in resistance-trained subjects that examined the effects
of consuming a high protein diet over the course of
several months on markers of performance, health and
body composition. This study as well as previous work
from our lab suggests that gains in body fat are unlikely
to occur with protein overfeeding in conjunction with
an increase in total energy intake [2].
Limitations of this study include the use of dietary
self-reports. It has been posited that underreporting of
dietary intake is a severe confounding variable in studies
that involve a dietary intervention. Interestingly, this is
not a universal finding. American women consistently
underreport their caloric intake in contrast with only
10 % of Egyptian women [16]. Novotny et al. found that
that a sex difference existed in underreporting (i.e.,
women underreport more than men) [17]. Much of the
additional protein consumed by the subjects in the
current study was in the form of protein powder; there-
fore it would seem reasonable to assume that our male
subjects could provide an accurate dietary recall with
such a simple dietary addition. Furthermore, from an en-
tirely pragmatic perspective, the use of dietary recalls is
the best option to assess food intake in free-living

trained athletes who undergo cycles of varying protein
intake over a period of several months or years. This
would at least provide information in terms of whether
the highly trained respond more so to a change in train-
ing stimulus, diet or a combination of both.
