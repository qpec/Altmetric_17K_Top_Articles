Exposure to ionizing radiation is ubiquitous, and it is well established that
moderate and high doses cause ill-health and can be lethal. The health effects
of low doses or low dose-rates of ionizing radiation are not so clear. This
paper describes a project which sets out to summarize, as a restatement, the
natural science evidence base concerning the human health effects of exposure
to low-level ionizing radiation. A novel feature, compared to other reviews, is
that a series of statements are listed and categorized according to the nature and
strength of the evidence that underpins them. The purpose of this restatement is
to provide a concise entre
´e into this vibrant field, pointing the interested reader
deeper into the literature when more detail is needed. It is not our purpose to
reach conclusions on whether the legal limits on radiation exposures are too
high, too low or just right. Our aim is to provide an introduction so that non-
specialist individuals in this area (be they policy-makers, disputers of policy,
health professionals or students) have a straightforward place to start. The sum-
mary restatement of the evidence and an extensively annotated bibliography
are provided as appendices in the electronic supplementary material.
1. Introduction
Ionizing radiation is radiation that carries enough energy that it can ionize atoms or
molecules (i.e. strip electrons from them) as it passes through matter. Life on the

 Earth has always been exposed to ionizing radiation from
natural sources, for example radon gas (figure 1). During the
past 120 years the development of medical, military and indus-
trial uses of radiation has created additional exposure from
man-made sources. Large doses of radiation are known to be
detrimental to the health of organisms including humans, but
the health effects of low doses and doses delivered at low
dose-rates are not completely clear. A ‘low dose’ of radiation
has been defined by several organizations as 100 milligray
(mGy) or less of sparsely ionizing radiation (e.g. electrons), and
a ‘low dose-rate’ as less than 0.1 mGy min21 of sparsely ionizing
radiation when averaged over about 1 h. The sievert (Sv) is a
non-physical derived unit used in the context of radiological
protection, which weights the amount of energy deposited in
tissue (the absorbed dose measured in gray (Gy), where
1 Gy ¼ 1 J kg21) by different types of radiation (giving equival-
ent dose, in Sv), and the relative sensitivity of tissues (giving
effective dose, in Sv) to probabilistic (stochastic) effects such as
cancer induction by low doses or low dose-rates. The weights
used in calculating effective dose are based upon an expert con-
sensus grounded in scientific evidence, but with elements of
subjectivity [2,3]. Effective dose is a measure of detriment
devised for the purposes of protection, so that doses from differ-
ent sorts of radiation and dose distributions can be combined
appropriately. In the UK, the average annual effective dose
from natural background radiation is 2.3 mSv [4], so an accumu-
lated dose of 100 mSv would commonly arise over 40–50 years
of exposure at a low dose-rate. Any medical exposure (or other
man-made exposure) would be additional to that.
There is an international system of radiological protection
which considers situations of planned, existing and emergency
exposures and, specifically for planned exposures, recommends
annual limits on the amount of additional effective dose that
should not be exceeded. Those annual limits are 1 mSv for the
public and 20 mSv for radiation workers (these limits exclude
natural background radiation and radiation doses received in
medical procedures) [5]. Most countries use these recommen-
dations in their legislation, but some do not. For example in
the USA, the annual limit for workers is 50 mSv [6]. These
limits, and the radiological protection system in general, are
based upon the ‘linear, no threshold’ (LNT) dose–response
model, which assumes that the excess risk from low-level
exposure is directly proportional to dose and that there is no
dose so small that it has no effect. On this basis, it is rec-
ommended that all relevant doses should be summed to
ensure that individuals do not exceed the annual limits.
Both the LNT model and the dose limits are widely debated
[7,8]. Some believe that they are too strict and impose unreason-
able costs on the use of radiation. Others believe that they are not
strict enough and allow too much risk from radiation exposure.
A widely accepted illustration of the approximate magnitude of
the risk from a low dose is that if 100 individuals were each
exposed to 100 mSv then, over a lifetime, approximately one
of them would be expected to develop a radiation-induced
cancer, whereas around 42 of them would be expected to
develop cancer from other causes [9]. Although the potential
risks considered here may be small for any individual, very
large populations may be exposed, so the magnitude of these
health effects should not be dismissed as unimportant [10].
Within a year of Ro
¨entgen’s 1895 discovery of X-rays [11],
dermatitis caused by high-dose X-ray radiation had been
described [12] and protective measures to reduce exposure
were already advised [13]. In the ensuing 120 years, a large lit-
erature has established a detailed, quantitative description of

 the health risks of radiation. Both sides of the debate about risks
from low-level exposure cite this underlying natural science evi-
dence base in support of their arguments. The aim of the project
described here isto provide a ‘restatement’ of that evidence base
in a succinct and accessible manner to a non-technical reader.
2. Methods
Apreliminarydraftreviewoftheliteratureonhealthrisksoflow-level
radiation was constructed. At a 1-day workshop, most authors met to
discuss the different evidence components. A second draft was then
made and each piece of evidence was assigned a descriptor. Because
of the very extensive nature of the underlying evidence base, we
devised a set of categories that are broadly speaking a ranked score
of the strength and consistency of the supporting evidence. In these
descriptors, a ‘well-powered study’ means a study that has high
probabilityof detectinganeffectof agivensizewhenthat relationship
genuinely exists. Statements are considered to be supported by:
[Cons] data support a consensus based upon a single well-powered
study, or one or more pooled analyses with consistent results, or
several lower powered studies with consistent results;
[Emco] data support an emerging consensus based upon a single,
well-powered study (which may be an individual study or a
pooled analysis), but in a context where other studies report dis-
parate results or repeat analyses have not yet been performed;
[Noco] there is no consensus interpretation because the data are
insufficient in quantity or too variable; and
[Projn] projections based on available evidence but with substan-
tial uncertainties.
The second draft was sent to 16 scientists who are experts in
low-level radiation including representatives from academia,
government and non-governmental organizations.
The project was funded by the Oxford Martin School (part of
the University of Oxford) and though many groups were con-
sulted, the project was conducted completely independently of
any stakeholder.
This is not a systematic review and the categorization of the
evidence statements represents the opinion of the authors arrived
at through debate, but not through other formal consensus pro-
cedures. Systematic reviews of the literature on the health
effects of ionizing radiation exist elsewhere and are hundreds
of pages long (e.g. [5,9,14]).
3. Results
Thefullsummaryofthenaturalscienceevidencebaseisgivenas
a restatement of the evidence in appendix A with an annotated
bibliography as appendix B, both in the electronic supple-
mentary material. Each section of the restatement ends with a
short paragraph summarizing the evidence. Those ‘summaries
of summaries’ are presented here.
(a) Definitions and units
The absorbed dose of radiation is quantified in gray (Gy)
and is the amount of energy deposited in joules per kilogram.

leukaemia incidence excluding CLL in a cohort of Ukrainian clean-up workers, and the Chernobyl liquidators data are for leukaemia incidence excluding CLL in a cohort of workers
from Belarus, Russia and Baltic countries. The Mayak workers data are for incidence of leukaemia excluding CLL in workers at the Mayak weapons plant in Russia. The Techa River
residents data are for leukaemia incidence excluding CLL in a cohort of individuals living downstream from the Mayak weapons plant in Russia. The Kerala background radiation
data are for leukaemia incidence excludingCLL in acohort of residents of a high background radiation area in India. The ankylosing spondylitis data are for leukaemia excluding CLL
mortality among UK patients with ankylosing spondylitis treated with X-rays. (c) Lung cancer following radon exposure. Because of the difference in magnitude in exposures to
radon between mining and residential contexts, studies have been split into two charts. The top chart denotes six studies of lung cancer mortality in miners of uranium, tin or
fluorspar in relation to cumulative exposure (in ‘working level months’). The uranium and tin miners study consists of 11 pooled international cohorts (including the Newfoundland
and Czech cohort). The Newfoundland and Czech single cohort studies have been more recently updated for results and have therefore also been drawn separately. The bottom
chart shows residential studies in relation to radon concentration (in Bq m23). The Chinese residential data are for lung cancer incidence across China; the North America residential
data are for lung cancer incidence across North America; and the European residential data are for lung cancer incidence across Europe. (Online version in colour.)

 Equivalent dose and effective dose use weightings of absorbed
dose and are described in sievert (Sv). For the purposes of radio-
logical protection at low-level exposure, recommendations
regarding stochastic effects are issued using effective dose in sie-
vert. Ill-effects of radiation are divided into two broad types:
‘harmful tissue reactions’ at higher doses and ‘stochastic effects’
(such as cancer) across all doses including lower doses.
(b) Background exposure and uncertainties at low dose
Across the world, the average effective dose from natural
background radiation is 2.4 mSv yr21. Large epidemiological
studies can be used to estimate the health risk of higher doses
and, through statistical calculation of confidence intervals, infer
that risks are greater than zero. But at doses in the range of the
natural background, even the largest epidemiological studies
have substantial difficulties in reliably distinguishing between
low risk and zero risk (figure 2). Radiobiological knowledge of
relevant processes following low-level exposure is incomplete
and therefore point estimates for low dose or low dose-rate
risks above the background are inferred by extrapolation from
the results of epidemiological studies at higher doses. Several
different models can be used for such extrapolation and most
are largely consistent with the low-level data available (figure 3).
(c) Acute high-dose exposures
High doses are described in units of gray. With a whole-body
acute dose of greater than 15 Gy, death is certain within
5 days. With a whole-body acute dose of 2.5–5 Gy, without
good medical care, death owing to bone marrow damage may
follow within two months in around 50% of healthy adults
exposed. With a whole-body acute dose of 1 Gy, without good
medical care, death owing to bone marrow damage may
follow in about 10% of those exposed. Doses above about
0.5 Gy will depress blood-forming processes over the coming
week and cause a range of other morbidities including
erythema, epilation and sterility. Cataracts and damage to the
circulatory system that may become apparent many years
later are also caused at doses above about 0.5 Gy; whether or
not lower doses cause cataracts and circulatory disease is a
topic of ongoing study and debate. Even at high doses no stat-
istically significant excess of hereditary effects have been seen
inthe offspringofpeoplewhowere exposedpriorto conception,
although animal experiments do show such effects and imply
that they may occur at a very low frequency in humans.
(d) Low dose exposures
The primary ill-health caused by low to moderate doses
of ionizing radiation is cancer, although the possibility of non-
cancer effects (particularly cardiovascular disease) is of increas-
ing concern. Very large studies would be required to detect
the ill-effects of doses of around 1–10 mSv. Doses of this size
are routinely encountered—for example, from natural back-
ground radiation and medical diagnostic exposures. Radiation
epidemiology is primarily informed by studies that compare
individuals with varying levels of radiation exposure.
(e) The Japanese Life Span Study
The study of survivors of the atomic bombings of Japan (the
Japanese Life Span Study; LSS) is the largest and longest
study of risks from ionizing radiation. It is treated as the
‘gold standard’ in the sense that the results of other studies
are compared with its results. Its headline results are that at
1 Gy (dose to the colon) the risk of mortality from solid
cancer is raised by 50% and at 1 Gy (dose to the red bone
marrow) the risk of mortality from leukaemia is quadrupled.
Note that the excess relative risk quoted here is different from
the nominal excess absolute lifetime risk coefficient for cancer
of 5.5% per Sv derived by the ICRP and used in optimization
calculations. Excess relative risk (the proportional increase in
risk) is only meaningful in the context of the underlying risk
in an unexposed population. So, for example, in the LSS to
2003 there were 50 620 deaths, of which 10 929 were from
solid cancers, and 318 from leukaemia. Thus, even though
the excess relative risk at 1 Gy is much higher for leukaemia
than for solid cancer, around 525 of the solid cancer deaths
and only around 105 of the leukaemia deaths are estimated
to be radiation-associated. Large studies of individuals con-
ceived
to
parents
who
were
survivors
of
the
atomic
bombings find no statistically significant adverse effects.
(f) The Chernobyl nuclear power plant accident
A number of early emergency workers at the accident at the
Chernobyl nuclear power plant received high doses which pro-
duced tissue reactions and 28 early deaths. The long-term
health impacts are contested. There is consensus on two
major health impacts: thyroid cancers caused by high levels
of exposure of children to radioactive iodine, and ill-effects to
mental health caused by widespread fear of potential risks
and social disruption. There is emerging evidence on the risk
of leukaemia among recovery workers and those risks are
broadly in line with what is expected from the LSS. At present,
there is little convincing evidence of other radiation-associated
effects in recovery workers or the wider public.
(g) The Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant
accident
The Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant accident has
caused substantial ill-health through the effects of the evacua-
tions, continued displacement and fear of radiation. It is
unclear if there will be a detectable excess in thyroid cancer in
the coming years. No other discernible increase in ill-health
attributable to radiation exposure is expected in either
emergency workers or members of the public.
(h) Studies of workers exposed to radiation
Workers in the nuclear industries often have both external and
internal radiation exposure. Their risks from external doses
for solid cancer and leukaemia are consistent with those
observed in the LSS even though their doses are accumulated
at low dose-rates over many years. In the International Nuclear
Workers Study (INWORKS), even among those who have total
accumulated doses below 100 mGy, the risk of mortality from
solid cancer is consistent with the LSS estimate (although the
confidence intervals are wide). Radiologists and radiation tech-
nicians who worked during the early years have increased risks
of leukaemia, skin cancer and, for women, breast cancer. More
recent cohorts (from an era of lower doses to workers) have not
yet displayed excess risks, but are still young. Cataract risk may
be increased in medical workers who use X-ray imaging to
guide interventions. Underground hard rock miners have an
elevated risk of lung cancer roughly in proportion to their
exposure to radon gas and its radioactive progeny.

 (i) Environmental exposure
Radon in the home increases the risk of lung cancer, particu-
larly for smokers. Regions of the world with high natural
background radiation do not consistently show an excess risk
of solid cancers even in large studies. Fallout from nuclear
weapons testing caused low-level internal exposures that
were concentrated in time and, to a lesser extent, space, with
risks of childhood leukaemia that are consistent with the
risks estimated from the LSS. There have been clusters of child-
hood leukaemia close to and away from nuclear installations
that remain unexplained.
( j) Medical exposure
After adjustment for dose fractionation and high-dose cell
killing, the risks posed by radiation received as therapy are
broadly in line with LSS data. Doses from diagnostic X-rays
are much lower, but some studies describe raised risks of
childhood leukaemia and other childhood cancers after
in utero exposure. Recent studies of leukaemia and brain
cancer after childhood computed tomography (CT) scans
report raised risks, but the extent to which the pre-existing
health status of the patients might confound this association
needs further consideration. The principle of justification
emphasizes that health benefits of radiation use in medicine
must outweigh any radiation exposure risks.
(k) Experimental studies of mechanisms of damage
Studies in vitro have clearly established that radiation can
damage DNA in ways that if mis-repaired could, in vivo,
lead to cancer. Because of the stochastic nature of interactions
of radiation with DNA and other molecules, it is reasonable
to expect initial damage at low doses to have a linear
dose–response, but subsequent cellular responses may not
have a linear dose–response and may be different at low
versus high doses. Despite much elucidation of the under-
lying cellular processes, it is still not clear precisely what
steps are necessary and sufficient for a dose of radiation
to eventually lead to cancer (sometimes decades later).
Currently, there are no validated bio-markers of radiation-
induced cancers. Understanding of the mechanisms whereby
radiation causes cardiovascular disease and cataracts is still
less advanced.
(l) Experimental studies that inform risk assessment
Studies in vitro demonstrate a linear dose–response for
chromosome aberrations at doses between 20 and 100 mGy.
Irradiation of animals has clearly established that moderate
and high doses of radiation (usually 100 mGy to several Gy)
can cause cancer and life-shortening (also largely owing to
cancer). Dose–response relationships at low dose are mostly
linear. Irradiation of male mice before mating has demon-
strated that radiation-induced mutations can be passed to
offspring in a manner that is proportional to parental dose.
Analysis comparing dose–response slopes at low and high
doses implies that radiation delivered at a low dose or a low
dose-rate carries two-to fourfold less risk than acute doses of
the same total dose. An equivalent analysis that combines
human epidemiological data and animal experimental data
estimated that the dose and dose-rate effectiveness factor
may only be about 1.5-fold and this factor is under further
investigation.
(m) Perspectives
Compared with other common health risks (obesity, tobacco
smoking, exposure to ambient particulate air pollution), the
number of years of life lost owing to radiation exposure is small.
4. Discussion
This restatement appears in the context of a global system
designed to integrate and summarize the body of knowledge
on the outcome of human exposure to ionizing radiation.
That system starts with a disseminated, natural science
endeavour that produces a primary literature [16]; continues
with several national and international bodies that synthesize
the literature on the biology and epidemiology of radiation
risks [9,14]; produces recommendations based upon the
science [5]; which are turned into safety standards [17]; and
then enacted as international and national law [18]. The pub-
lished syntheses are very much longer and more detailed
than this restatement. It is our aim to provide a concise intro-
duction that can point the interested reader deeper into the
literature when more detail is needed.
There are several aspects of radiation risk that we do not
attempt to address. For example, we do not cover the science
of estimating the dispersal of radionuclides after a release; a
review is provided by Yao [19]. Nor do we cover the regulation
of radioactivity in food [20]. The project considers only the
natural science evidence base (although we make some refer-
ence to the psycho-social science of the impact of accidents).
There are other important social science issues involved in
the making of policy around radiation risks. Among these
are economic considerations of the valuation of any damage
caused, and the costs associated with radiation protection
[21] and clean-up operations [22,23]. Finally, in focusing on
human health effects of radiation, we have not considered
environmental impacts and do not discuss the effects of
radiation contamination on wildlife [24].
The purpose of this restatement is not to reach conclusions
on whether the legal limits on radiation exposures are too high,
too low or just right, nor to declare whether it is defensible to
use the LNT model to approximate the risks of stochastic
effects (largely cancer but including hereditary effects). Our
purpose is to provide an entre
´e to this large and vibrant litera-
ture so that non-specialist individuals with responsibility for
making or disputing policy in this area have a straightforward
place to start.
