Abstract
An unprecedented Ebola virus (EBOV) epidemic occurred in 2013–2016 in West Africa.
Over this time the epidemic exponentially grew and moved to Europe and North America,
with several imported cases and many Health Care Workers (HCW) infected. Better under-
standing of EBOV infection patterns in different body compartments is mandatory to develop
new countermeasures, as well as to fully comprehend the pathways of human-to-human
transmission. We have longitudinally explored the persistence of EBOV-specific negative
sense genomic RNA (neg-RNA) and the presence of positive sense RNA (pos-RNA), includ-
ing both replication intermediate (antigenomic-RNA) and messenger RNA (mRNA) mole-
cules, in the upper and lower respiratory tract, as compared to plasma, in a HCW infected
with EBOV in Sierra Leone, who was hospitalized in the high isolation facility of the National
Institute for Infectious Diseases “Lazzaro Spallanzani” (INMI), Rome, Italy. We observed
persistence of pos-RNA and neg-RNAs in longitudinally collected specimens of the lower
respiratory tract, even after viral clearance from plasma, suggesting possible local replica-
tion. The purpose of the present study is to enhance the knowledge on the biological fea-
tures of EBOV that can contribute to the human-to-human transmissibility and to develop
effective intervention strategies. However, further investigation is needed in order to better
understand the clinical meaning of viral replication and shedding in the respiratory tract.

 longitudinally explored the presence of already assessed markers of ongoing EBOV repli-
cation (negative sense genomic RNA and positive sense RNA) in the upper and lower
respiratory tract, as compared to plasma and other body compartments, in a Health Care
Worker infected with EBOV in Sierra Leone, who was hospitalized in the high isolation
facility of the National Institute for Infectious Diseases “Lazzaro Spallanzani” (INMI),
Rome, Italy. The presence of total EBOV RNA and replication markers was observed in
specimens of the lower respiratory tract, even after viral clearance from plasma, suggesting

Introduction
The Ebola virus (EBOV) Makona variant is a negative-sense RNA virus and a member of the
Filoviridae. From December 2013 to January 2016, this EBOV Makona caused the largest viral
hemorrhagic fever epidemic ever reported in West Africa. [1] Several patients received care in
Europe and North America. [2] Among those, two were medically evacuated to the National
Institute for Infectious Diseases (INMI) “Lazzaro Spallanzani” of Rome, Italy. The clinical
findings of the first imported case to Italy confirmed for Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) have been
previously reported [3,4]. Like other patients, who received care outside of Africa, this patient
presented a significant lung involvement, consistent with interstitial pneumonia, suggesting
that EBOV could cause lung damage, perhaps through replication in these tissues. [4–6] The
second imported case to Italy was a Health Care Worker (HCW) working in an Ebola Treat-
ment Center (ETC) in Sierra Leone. He was admitted to INMI for EVD on May 13, 2015 and
was discharged in good clinical condition on June 10, 2015. Oral favipiravir (Toyama Chemi-
cal Co, Japan), monoclonal antibodies against EBOV (Mil77, Mabworks Beijing China) and
sustained hydration were administered, followed by progressive clinical improvement. A lon-
gitudinal characterization of cellular immune response has been described in detail elsewhere
[7]. At admission, on day three from onset of symptoms, the patient had fever (39.0˚C), cough,
and a delayed febrile thrombocytopenic syndrome with pericardial effusion; chest X ray
showed a basal mild interstitial lung involvement with 89% oxygen saturation. There is no
direct evidence suggesting that EBOV can infect lung tissue in humans, although the potential
role of EBOV infection of respiratory system has been suggested by clinical in vitro experi-
ments, animal studies and clinical case reports [4,5,8–12]. In addition, viral inclusions can be
found inside alveolar macrophages, and free viral particles can be seen within alveolar spaces.
In this study, we compared the levels of EBOV negative sense genomic RNA (neg-RNA) and
positive sense RNA (pos-RNA), including both mRNAs and anti-genomic RNAs, as indicators
of viral replication in clinical specimen of the second EVD patient treated at INMI [13,14], to
explore the potential role of different body compartment in EBOV replication.
Results
Plasma and sputum clinical specimens
Fig 1 (Panels A and C) shows the trends of total viral RNA in plasma (viremia) and in spu-
tum. High EBOV viremia was detected in the first days of hospital admission (with a peak
of 108 copies/mL at day 1) with a marked decrease at day 3, also overlapping with the
administration of Mil77. Declining EBOV viremia continued after further administration

 of MIL77 on day 6, and reached undetectable levels on day 9. In contrast, total EBOV RNA
in sputum peaked at day 6 with above 107 copies/mL and remained high at around 106 cop-
ies/mL up to day 9 before becoming undetectable at day 11. Fig 1 shows neg-RNA and pos-
RNA levels, in plasma (Panel B) and in sputum (Panel D). High levels of neg-RNA and pos-
RNA, were detected in plasma up to day 4 and 3, respectively. In the respiratory compart-
ment, neg-RNA was present at a concentration of 106 copies/mL up to day 11, and pos-
RNA was present at a concentration of 104 copies/mL up to day 10 (Panel D). The levels of
neg-RNA and pos-mRNA in sputum samples were 2 or 3-Log higher than neg-RNA and
pos-RNA values in plasma, respectively.

the patient were collected daily (plasma and nasopharyngeal swab) and regularly throughout hospitalization (Sputum). Arrows indicate
the administration of the experimental drug Mil77 (day 3 and day 6). Dotted lines represent the hypothetical trend of those samples not
available for this study. Panel A: trend of total EBOV RNA (viremia), which becomes undetectable at day 9. Panel B: trends of neg-RNA
and pos-RNA in plasma, which become undetectable at day 5 and 4, respectively. Panel C: trend of total virus RNA in sputum, which
becomes undetectable at day 11. Panel D: trends of neg-RNA and pos-RNA in sputum, which become undetectable at day 11 and 10,
respectively. Panel E: trend of total EBOV RNA in nasopharyngeal swab. In nasopharyngeal swab the total EBOV RNA reaches
undetectable levels at day 13 of hospitalization. Panel F: trends of neg-RNA and pos-RNA in nasopharyngeal swab, which become
undetectable at day 10 and 6, respectively. Symbols are specified in the panels.

 Total, neg- and pos-RNA in other clinical specimens
The presence of total, neg- and pos-RNA in nasopharyngeal swab is shown in Fig 1. As
depicted, total RNA was present at high levels (106 copies/mL) until day 5, and detected at
low levels (103 copies/mL) until day 12 before becoming undetectable at day 13 (Panel E). The
prolonged detection of total RNA was paralleled by that of neg-RNA, which was detectable
(102−103 copies/mL) until day 10 (Panel B) while pos-RNA became undetectable on day 6
(Panel F). In ocular swabs and urine samples, total RNA remained detectable up to day 15 (103
copies/mL) and day 4 (104 copies/mL), respectively. Interestingly, pos-RNA was always unde-
tectable in all specimens analyzed from these compartments, whereas neg-RNA was detectable
around 102 copies/mL both in urine and ocular swab.
Discussion
This study presents novel insights in the potential role of the respiratory compartment in
EBOV replication in a human case of EVD. Several clinical findings suggest lung involvement
in different cases of EVD who received care in Europe [4] and the USA [5]. The chest radiogra-
phy performed in patients treated in the USA revealed bilateral pulmonary infiltrates sugges-
tive of pneumonia [5]. Moreover, the first EVD patient treated in Italy developed significant
lung injury, consistent with interstitial pneumonia [4]. The role of neg-RNA and pos-RNA lev-
els as surrogate markers of ongoing EBOV replication has already been established in in vitro
experiments [13]. We confirmed the specificity of this method using VeroE6 infected cells,
where at 24 hours post-infection we observed that the majority of pos-RNA (62%) was cell-
associated, while neg-RNA was mostly (84%) shed in the supernatant. In addition, the sensitiv-
ity and the linearity of the test were unaffected by sample matrix composition, since plasma
and sputum spiked with EBOV viral RNA (Ct 22,12 and Ct 22,41, respectively, for the RNA
concentration 105) did not influence tests results as compared to tissue culture medium. Fur-
ther, no appreciable background noise signal was observed in unspiked plasma and sputum
matrices (Ct > 45). Hence, we longitudinally explored the persistence of viral replication
markers in clinical samples from the upper and lower respiratory tract of the second EVD
patient in Italy, and made comparison with plasma samples. The results indicate the decay of
EBOV total RNA, neg-RNA and pos-RNA overtime, which was significantly different in
plasma when compared to respiratory samples. In particular, we observed a persistence of total
viral RNA and replication markers in sputum, until the second week of hospital stay (up to day
10), when viremia was already undetectable. From these data the possibility that the prolonged
detection of EBOV RNA in sputum merely reflects enhanced stability of EBOV RNA in this
compartment cannot be ruled out [16]; nevertheless the detection of pos-RNA together with
neg-RNA in sputum (until day 9 and 10 of hospital stay, respectively) supports the concept of
active viral replication within the respiratory tract, rather than plasma spill-over or prolonged
RNA stability. Indeed, the detection of the replication markers in respiratory samples com-
bined with the absence of detectable neg-RNA in the plasma from day 5, while neg-RNA
could still be detected for days in respiratory samples, can be explained by active replication of
EBOV in lung tissues. Moreover, the absence of detectable levels of pos-RNA in nasopharyn-
geal swabs (starting day 6 and onward) suggests that the presence of pos-RNA in sputum is
likely due to replicating EBOV in the lower rather than in the upper respiratory tract. Addi-
tional observations are indicative of a direct role of EBOV replication in lung injury in animals
(including nonhuman primates) and in post-mortem examination of human that succumbed
with EVD [12]. Moreover, a recent study evaluated the pathogenicity in rhesus macaques of 2
different isolates of the EBOV Makona strains compared to the EBOV Mayinga isolate, show-
ing higher lung pathology in macaques infected with the two Makona strains [17]. In pigs,

 EBOV can replicate to high titers in the lower respiratory tract and cause severe lung diseases
following mucosal exposure [18]. Guinea pigs challenged with aerosolized EBOV can develop
lethal interstitial pneumonia [8] while rhesus monkeys demonstrate a significant respiratory
involvement [9] with cell-associated EBOV virus antigens present in airway epithelium, alveo-
lar pneumocytes, and macrophages [10,11]. The hypothesis that EBOV can actually replicate
into human airway is supported by a recently published review, which collected data from post
mortem examinations of 89 fatal cases of filoviral infections (24 of which with EBOV) [12].
This analysis provides evidence of viral replication within the respiratory tract, showing the
presence of viral antigens in several lung tissues, with EBOV nucleic acids detected in resident
macrophages [12]. Unfortunately, we were only able to recover replication competent virus
from plasma collected at presentation and were unable to recover replication competent virus
from later plasma samples or other clinical specimens, despite numerous attempts in VeroE6
cell culture (especially from sputum). Since other Authors report difficulties in EBOV isolation
from non-blood samples, it is possible that the actual sensitivity of cell culture isolation is not
sufficient to rule out virus viability and infectivity [19–20]. To this respect, several factors,
among which suboptimal sensitivity of the virus culture system, storage at -80˚C and presence
of antibodies against EBOV in the clinical samples, may have contributed to unsuccessful virus
culture attempts. Despite the lack of supportive data, a key additional question is whether pri-
mary pulmonary infection and respiratory transmission of EBOV could actually occur [6].
The presence of virus replication markers here reported adds some support to this possibility,
although the evidence is far from being conclusive, due to the absence of recovery of infectious
virus in respiratory secretion. Further investigation is needed to better understand the clinical
significance of the involvement of the respiratory tract in viral replication and shedding, and
possible contribution to respiratory impairment and human–to–human transmission.
Materials and Methods
Patient’s clinical specimens were longitudinally collected for diagnostic purposes. Plasma sam-
ples, nasopharyngeal swabs, ocular swabs and urine samples were collected daily (starting
from day 1, day 3, day 1 and day 1, respectively) while sputum samples (mucus and phlegm
coughed-up from the lower airways) were repeatedly collected (starting from day 4) through-
out hospitalization. We made all efforts to uniform the time (morning) and size (4 mL) of sam-
ple collection, in order to minimize this as possible source of difference. Inactivation of
samples was performed in the BSL4 facility and RNA extraction was carried out in the BSL2
laboratory. RNA extraction was performed with QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen) fol-
lowing manufacturer’s instructions. Identical volumes (140 μl) of each sample have been used
for RNA extraction. The quality of all the samples was checked using a house-keeping gene
(RNaseP) in qRT-PCR according to [15]. Total virus-specific RNA (total RNA) was measured
using quantitative Real-time PCR, RealStar Filovirus Screen RT-PCR Kit 1.0 (Altona Diagnos-
tics GmbH), targeting L gene. To measure EBOV-specific negative sense genomic RNA (neg-
RNA) and positive sense RNA (pos-RNA) [including both replication intermediate (cRNA)
and messenger RNA (mRNA)], L-gene specific reverse or forward primers were used in the
reverse transcription step [13,14], using TaqMan Reverse Transcription Reagent kit (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). cDNAs were treated with 1μL of RNase H (2U/ μL) for 20’
at 37˚C, to remove remaining viral RNAs, and then amplified using the RealStar Filovirus
Screen RT-PCR Kit 1.0, with a modified thermal profile, which omitted the reverse transcrip-
tion step. The standard curve of the RealStar Filovirus Screen RT-PCR Kit 1.0 has been used to
determine the concentration of the virus in the different clinical specimens. In our experimen-
tal conditions, the range of the curve is from 109 copies/mL down to 102 copies/mL.
