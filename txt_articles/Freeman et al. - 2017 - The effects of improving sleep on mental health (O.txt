Summary 
Background Sleep difficulties might be a contributory causal factor in the occurrence of mental health problems. If 
this is true, improving sleep should benefit psychological health. We aimed to determine whether treating insomnia 
leads to a reduction in paranoia and hallucinations.
Methods We did this single-blind, randomised controlled trial (OASIS) at 26 UK universities. University students with 
insomnia were randomly assigned (1:1) with simple randomisation to receive digital cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) 
for insomnia or usual care, and the research team were masked to the treatment. Online assessments took place at 
weeks 0, 3, 10 (end of therapy), and 22. The primary outcome measures were for insomnia, paranoia, and hallucinatory 
experiences. We did intention-to-treat analyses. The trial is registered with the ISRCTN registry, number ISRCTN61272251.
Findings Between March 5, 2015, and Feb 17, 2016, we randomly assigned 3755 participants to receive digital CBT for 
insomnia (n=1891) or usual practice (n=1864). Compared with usual practice, the sleep intervention at 10 weeks 
reduced insomnia (adjusted difference 4·78, 95% CI 4·29 to 5·26, Cohen’s d=1·11; p<0·0001), paranoia (–2·22, 
–2·98 to –1·45, Cohen’s d=0·19; p<0·0001), and hallucinations (–1·58, –1·98 to –1·18, Cohen’s d=0·24; p<0·0001). 
Insomnia was a mediator of change in paranoia and hallucinations. No adverse events were reported.
Interpretation To our knowledge, this is the largest randomised controlled trial of a psychological intervention for a 
mental health problem. It provides strong evidence that insomnia is a causal factor in the occurrence of psychotic 
experiences and other mental health problems. Whether the results generalise beyond a student population requires 
testing. The treatment of disrupted sleep might require a higher priority in mental health provision.

Introduction
Sleep problems are a common occurrence in patients 
with mental health disorders. The traditional view is that 
disrupted sleep is a symptom, consequence, or non-
specific epiphenomenon of the disorders; the clinical 
result is that the treatment of sleep problems is given a 
low priority. An alternative perspective is that disturbed 
sleep is a contributory causal factor in the occurrence of 
many mental health disorders.1 An escalating cycle then 
emerges between the distress of the mental health 
symptoms, effect on daytime functioning, and struggles 
in gaining restorative sleep. From this alternative 
perspective, the treatment of sleep problems attains a 
higher clinical importance. We are particularly interested 
in the putative causal association between disturbed sleep 
and psychotic experiences.2,3 The interventionist–causal 
model approach to establishment of a causal association 
is to manipulate the hypothesised mechanistic variable 
and observe the effect on the outcome of interest;4 if 
a causal association exists then the outcome variable 
should alter. The effects of the manipulation can then be 
substantiated further by use of mediation analysis.5,6 In 
the present study, we aimed to improve sleep in 
individuals with insomnia to determine the effect on 
psychotic experiences. This approach therefore informs 
both theoretical understanding and clinical practice.
The most common form of sleep disruption is insomnia, 
comprising sustained difficulties in initiating or staying 
asleep, or both, which cause problems during the day. The 
association of insomnia with psychotic experiences in the 
general population has been established.3 There are 
multiple, independent, psychotic experiences. Each 
psychotic experience exists on a spectrum of severity in 
the general population with differing heritability and 
differing strength of association with insomnia.7 Paranoia 
and hallucinations have the strongest links with 
insomnia.2,7,8 However, the effect of altering the amount of 
sleep disruption—eg, by targeted sleep treatment—on 
these psychotic experiences remains to be established. 
Clinical guidelines recommend the use of cognitive 
behavioural therapy (CBT) as the first-line treatment for 
insomnia.9 Digital forms of CBT for insomnia that require

no therapist to be present have been shown to be 
efficacious as well.10–12 In patients with current delusions 
and hallucinations, results of our pilot randomised 
controlled trial13 have shown that insomnia can be 
substantially reduced with CBT, but the trial was 
underpowered to establish with sufficient precision the 
consequences for psychotic experiences. Therefore, we 
undertook a clinical trial that was large enough to 
definitively test the causal association between insomnia 
and self-reported psychotic experiences.
To test thousands of individuals, we did an online study 
using digital CBT for insomnia treatment. A participant 
pool (university students) was selected that would be easily 
reachable (since we would have access to large email lists) 
and at an age when mental health disorders emerge. We 
have previously shown in a student population that sleep 
problems are associated with elevated levels of paranoia, 
hallucinations, anxiety, depression, and manic symptoms.8 
Our main aim required a comparison between the 
effects of a reduction in insomnia (in a group receiving 
recommended treatment) and continued sleep disruption 
(in a group receiving usual care, which is likely to mean 
receiving little or no treatment). Clear change in sleep in 
one group relative to another was required to test the 
mechanistic hypothesis. We were not investigating the 
intervention elements that might lead to change. Our 
primary aim was to find out whether CBT for insomnia, 
compared with a usual practice control group, reduced 
insomnia and reduced paranoia and hallucinations by the 
end of treatment, and whether the changes in insomnia 
mediated the changes in psychotic experiences. We also 
aimed to determine the potential effects of sleep 
improvement on a wider range of mental health outcomes 
in this general population group. Our secondary aims 
were to investigate whether digital CBT for insomnia, 
compared with usual practice, reduced depression, anxiety, 
nightmares, and mania; improved psychological wellbeing; 
and led to the occurrence of fewer mental health disorders.
Methods
Study design and participants
We did this single-blind, randomised controlled trial 
(OASIS; Oxford Access for Students Improving Sleep) of 
digital CBT versus treatment as usual (usual practice). 
Screening, informed consent, assessments, allocation to 
condition, and the delivery of the intervention were 
carried out online using an automated system, a specially 
configured instance of True Colours, which is a system 
for the scheduled collection of outcome measures.14 
Participants in the control group were given access to the 
sleep intervention after their final assessment. The study 
received overall ethical approval from the University 
of Oxford Medical Sciences Inter-Divisional Ethics 
Committee and then local approvals at the other 
participating universities. The OASIS trial protocol has 
been published.15
Participants were eligible if they were attending 
university; had a positive screen for insomnia, as indicated 
by a score of 16 or lower on the Sleep Condition Indicator 
(SCI);16 and were 18 years or older. We had no exclusion 
criteria. 26 UK universities took part (appendix 1), 
ensuring a range in geographical locations and academic 
ability. The principal method of recruitment was sending 
a circular email within universities that contained a link to 
the web-based screening. When a circular email was not 
possible, recruitment was via advertisment on websites 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
If insomnia is a contributory cause of psychotic experiences, then 
the key test is whether improving sleep will lead to a reduction in 
psychotic experiences. We therefore searched for randomised 
controlled studies that set out to reduce insomnia and examine 
the effects on psychotic experiences. On June 23, 2017, we 
searched the entire archive (ie, using no date restrictions) of 
PubMed for: (Sleep OR Insomnia) AND (Delus* OR Hallucinat* OR 
Psychosis OR Psychotic OR Schizophren*) AND (CBT OR hypnotic 
OR medication) AND (Random* OR RCT). 130 papers were 
identified and only two were randomised controlled trials that 
tested the effects of sleep treatment on psychotic experiences, 
with the larger of the trials being our own with 50 patients with 
schizophrenia or related disorders. These trials were 
underpowered to determine with any precision the potential link 
between insomnia and psychotic experiences.
Added value of this study
We undertook what might be the largest randomised 
controlled trial to date of a psychological treatment. It is the 
first study adequately powered to determine the effects of 
treating sleep dysfunction on psychotic experiences. It shows 
very clearly that treatment of insomnia in students leads to a 
reduction in psychotic experiences. A mediation analysis 
supports this interpretation. Furthermore, the trial is 
consistent with a small number of other randomised 
controlled trials that indicate multiple other benefits for 
mental health when treating sleep problems.
Implications of all the available evidence
Sleep disruption might have a contributory causal role in the 
occurrence of psychotic experiences and a wide range of other 
mental health problems. Adequately powered tests in other 
populations would be helpful, but research indicating that the 
treatment of disrupted sleep requires a higher priority in 
mental health provision is accumulating.

March 5, 2015, and ended on Feb 17, 2016. We collected 
the final data on July 28, 2016. 
Randomisation and masking
As recommended for large clinical trials,17 we used 
simple randomisation (1:1) with an automated online 
system, ensuring that the research team was unable to 
affect randomisation. Participants completed all the 
assessments independently online and therefore their 
responses could not be affected by the trial team. 
Procedures
Assessments took place at weeks 0 (baseline), 3, 10 (end of 
therapy), and 22. The week 3 assessment comprised only 
the primary outcome measures. The week 3 assessment 
was carried out to assess in the mediation analyses the 
temporal order of changes. Participants received an email 
prompt to complete the assessments online. The order of 
the assessments was consistent across timepoints. If 
participants did not complete the assessment, then they 
received up to two email reminders 2 days apart. 
The CBT for insomnia intervention is called Sleepio.11,18 
It is provided in six sessions, lasting an average of 20 min 
each. Sessions are unlocked weekly, although participants 
can move at a slower pace. The full programme is 
accessible via any web browser and all participants start 
the programme online. Certain tools (eg, sleep diaries 
and relaxation audios) could also be accessed using the 
web browser of a smartphone. All of the sessions, sleep 
diaries, relaxation audios, and the scheduling tool could 
be accessed with an iPhone. Completion of an initial 
assessment drives the algorithms that personalise the 
programme. For example, the assessment leads to a 
tailored choice of treatment goal, with progress then 
reviewed at each subsequent session. The treatment 
includes behavioural, cognitive, and educational com-
ponents. The behavioural techniques include sleep 
restriction (ie, reducing the sleep window to enhance 
sleep consolidation), stimulus control (eg, getting out of 
bed after 15–20 min of wakefulness), and relaxation 
(eg, tensing and relaxing muscles when in bed). The 
cognitive techniques include paradoxical intention 
(eg, trying to stay awake), belief restructuring (eg, targeting 
unrealistic expectations about sleep), mindfulness 
(eg, acknowledging thoughts and feelings without 
dwelling on them), imagery (eg, generating positive 
mental images), and putting the day to rest (eg, setting 
time aside to reflect on the day). The educational 
component covers information about the processes of 
sleep and sleep hygiene. The programme is interactive, 
and content is presented by an animated therapist. 
Participants make a time for the session and are prompted 
via email or text message via a short message service if 
they do not attend. Participants complete daily sleep 
diaries throughout the intervention, which are used by 
the programme to tailor the advice. Sleep restriction is 
introduced in the third session of the course. The 
animated therapist proposes a new sleep window, which 
is calculated from the sleep diary data, and engages with 
the participant to help them select the timing of the 
window (eg, earlier versus later in the night). A more 
lenient sleep window is used for those individuals 
reporting substantial physical problems, other mental 
health problems, or moderate-to-severe sleepiness. The 
sleep window is regularly reviewed at each session after it 
has been introduced. If the sleep diary data indicate a 
sleep efficiency of 90% or higher, the animated therapist 
advises that 15 min is added to the sleep window. 
Throughout the course of therapy, participants had access 
to a moderated online community and an online library 
of information about sleep. Participants could also view 
their online case file, which included four sections: a 
progress review, a reminder of strategies, an agreed sleep 
schedule, and a list of further reading. Usual practice 
(treatment as usual) referred to the current care that the 
participants were receiving. The amount of treatment 
input was likely to be minimal, with prescription of 
medication for a small proportion. We did not attempt to 
alter the current care that participants received.
Outcomes
The primary outcomes were insomnia, paranoia, and 
hallucinatory experiences. The primary measure for 
insomnia was the SCI-8.16 This score is an 8-item 
measure, validated against DSM-5 criteria, assessing 
sleep and its impact on daytime functioning over the past 
week. Scores can range from 0 to 32 with higher scores 
indicating better sleep. A clinical cutoff of less than 
17 correctly identifies 89% of individuals with probable 
insomnia disorder. We used a version of the SCI that 
included one additional question, as a secondary outcome, 
regarding early morning waking. The internal consistency 
(Cronbach’s α at baseline) of the scale in the present study 
was 0·63.
Paranoia was assessed with the Green et al Paranoid 
Thought Scales (GPTS), part B.19 This scale assesses 
persecutory ideation, and the timeframe used was the 
past fortnight. The scale comprises 16 items, each rated 
on a 1 (not at all) to 5 (totally) scale. High scores indicate 
higher levels of paranoia. The internal consistency of the 
scale in the present study was 0·94.
The measure for hallucinations was the Specific 
Psychotic Experiences Questionnaire—Hallucinations 
subscale.20 The scale comprises nine items rated on a 
0 (not at all) to 5 (more than once per day) scale. The 
timeframe was the past fortnight. Higher scores indicate 
greater occurrences of hallucinatory experiences. The 
internal consistency of the scale in the present study 
was 0·93.
The secondary outcome measures for sleep were the 
Insomnia Severity Index (ISI;21 Cronbach’s α in the 
present study=0·67) and the Disturbing Dreams and 
Nightmare Severity Index22 (Cronbach’s α in the present

study=0·91). The secondary outcome measure for 
psychotic experiences was the 16-item version of the 
Prodromal Questionnaire23 (Cronbach’s α in the present 
study=0·79). A score of 6 or more has 87% specificity and 
87% sensitivity to correctly classify ultra-high risk for 
psychosis mental states in a help-seeking sample.
The measures to assess affective symptoms were the 
Patient Health Questionnaire 9-item version24 (PHQ-9; 
Cronbach’s α in the present study=0·85), the Generalised 
Anxiety Disorder 7-item version25 (GAD-7; Cronbach’s α 
in the present study=0·89), and the Altman Mania Scale26 
(Cronbach’s α in the present study=0·64). Psychological 
wellbeing was assessed with the Warwick–Edinburgh 
Mental Wellbeing Scale (WEMWBS;27 Cronbach’s α in 
the present study=0·89), and the Work and Social 
Adjustment Scale (WSAS;28 Cronbach’s α in the present 
study=0·83).
To assess the development of mental health disorders, 
we used established cutoffs on the Prodromal 
Questionnaire,23 Altman Mania Scale,26 PHQ,24 and 
GAD-7
.25 Participants were also asked at each assessment 
timepoint whether they were in contact with mental 
health services, had received a mental health diagnosis, 
took medication for a mental health problem, or were 
currently receiving any other psychological therapy.
If the trial team were informed of the occurrence of a 
serious adverse event for a trial participant, then this was 
recorded. Serious adverse events were defined as deaths, 
suicide attempts, serious violent incidents, admissions to 
secure units, and formal complaints about the online 
intervention.
Statistical analysis
We calculated the sample size on the basis of change in 
paranoia (one of the two psychotic symptoms studied), 
since following this intervention change would be 
expected to be lower in psychotic experiences than in 
insomnia. Based on the SDs observed from a previous 
study29 for the GPTS (SD 10·4), a total sample size of 2614 
participants (ie, 1307 per group) would provide 90% power 
to detect a small effect size in paranoia, with a 
standardised mean difference of 0·15, while accounting 
for a high amount of expected attrition (40%). In a study 
amendment, the sample size was increased because of a 
higher than initially expected dropout rate.
An outline of the analysis strategy was provided in the 
published trial protocol15 and a full statistical analysis 
plan was agreed before the trial analysis (appendix 2). All 
the analyses were validated by a second statistician. 
Analyses were by intention to treat and were carried out 
at the end of the last follow-up assessment (with no 
interim analyses). We analysed each continuous outcome 
with a linear mixed effects regression model to account 
for the repeated measures over time, and we analysed 
binary outcomes with a logistic mixed effects model. 
Mixed effects models are the recommended statistical 
technique for analysing clinical trials when outcomes are 
collected at repeated timepoints,30 and in this trial 
included outcome data at weeks 3, 10, and 22 available 
for all participants who had been randomly assigned. 
The method has the advantage of implicitly accounting 
for data missing at random. The estimated (adjusted) 
treatment differences from these analyses are therefore 
reported. The linear mixed effects models included the 
outcome as the response variable, timepoint, randomised 
group, and baseline score as fixed effects and random 
effects were estimated for students nested within 
universities. A student is located within one university, 
and so to estimate the random intercepts, we accounted 
for random variation between universities and between 
students within the same university. We modelled an 
interaction between time and randomised group as a 
fixed effect to allow estimation of treatment effect at all 
three timepoints. Sex and course level were included as 
covariates in the model. We used an unstructured 
variance–covariance matrix to model the within-subject 
error correlation structure. Results are presented as 
mean adjusted differences in scores between the 
randomised groups, with 95% CIs and associated two-
sided p values. We confirmed the normality assumption 
of the residuals for each outcome. No deviations from 
normality were apparent and therefore maximum 
likelihood estimates were reported. We did sensitivity 
analyses (pattern mixture models, inclusion of baseline 
covariates predictive of missing data, and imputation) for 
the three main outcomes, examining the robustness of 
the results to different assumptions regarding missing 
data. We calculated standardised effect sizes with 
Cohen’s d, dividing the treatment effect by the shared SD 
at baseline. We used similar logistic mixed effects models 
for the secondary binary outcomes.
To test the mediation hypotheses, we determined the 
extent of mediation of the week 3 and week 10 insomnia 
scores on the week 10 paranoia and hallucination 
outcomes. The approach used was similar to the method 
of Baron and Kenny,5,31 but made use of linear mixed 
effects models at each step. The approach involved four 
steps and three separate model fits. In two separate linear 
mixed effects models, the intervention was shown to be 
correlated with the outcome and then with the mediator. 
We then fitted the data to a third model with the outcome 
as the response and both the intervention and mediator 
as covariates. The parameters were extracted as per Baron 
and Kenny31 to obtain the total, direct, and indirect effects, 
and finally the percentage mediation was determined. In 
all models, we included baseline amounts of both the 
outcome and mediator as covariates. This method is 
similar to the mediation analysis in the study by Freeman 
and colleagues,32 but made use of linear mixed effects 
models to account for repeated measurements, rather 
than through structural equation modelling. We used 
STATA version 14.1 for the statistical analysis.
The trial is registered with the ISRCTN registry, 
number ISRCTN61272251.

Results
Between March 5, 2015, and Feb 17, 2016, we randomly 
assigned 3755 participants to receive digital CBT for 
insomnia (n=1891) or usual practice (n=1864; figure). 
The sample was predominately female, studying for 
their first university degree, and two-thirds were of 
white British ethnicity (table 1). Around a fifth of the 
participants were in contact with mental health services 
(table 1). The two randomised groups were well matched 
at baseline (table 1).
Appendix 1 has the full details of the sample, missing 
data patterns, sensitivity analyses, and all other analyses. 
The dropout from the study assessments was high (50%) 
during the course of the study, and was greater in the 
treatment group than in the control group, with this figure 
and pattern almost identical to the most comparable 
previous study.12 The baseline scores for the three primary 
outcomes (insomnia, paranoia, and hallucinations) were 
not associated with later missingness (appendix 1). 
Compared with participants who remained in the study, 
participants who dropped out from both groups were 
younger in age and more likely to be male (appendix 1). 
For the secondary measures, ISI, PHQ-9, Altman Mania 
Scale, and WSAS scores were slightly higher, and the 
WEMWBS score was slightly lower, in the missing groups 
than the non-missing groups (appendix 1).
Treatment uptake was relatively low. In the intervention 
group, 1302 participants (69%) logged on for at least one 
treatment session, 953 (50%) accessed at least two sessions, 
672 (36%) accessed at least three sessions, 497 (26%) 
accessed at least four sessions, 390 (21%) accessed at least 
five sessions, and 331 (18%) accessed six sessions (figure).
Regarding the primary measures, the sleep treatment 
was associated with significant reductions, at all 
timepoints, in insomnia, paranoia, and hallucinations 
compared with the control group (all p<0·0001; table 2). 
The reduction in insomnia after treatment was large, 
while the reduction in psychotic experiences was small 
(table 2). After treatment, 454 (62%) of 733 individuals in 
the treatment group and 326 (29%) of 1142 individuals in 
the control group scored outside the clinical cutoff for 
insomnia used for trial entry. The treatment differences 
were robust to the three different types of sensitivity 
analyses for missing data (appendix 1). A conservative 
imputation (given the general improvement in scores in 
both groups) of missing data was used, whereby the last 
available measurement for a participant was imputed for 
all further missing measurements of that participant. All 
three primary outcome differences remained significant 
with last observation carried forward imputations 
(appendix 1). Treatment differences also remained 
consistent with the primary analysis when we repeated 
the main analyses covarying for baseline variables that 
predicted missingness for each outcome. We also used 
pattern mixture models. Treatment differences would 
still be significant assuming the missing individuals in 
the treatment group had outcome scores 2 points worse 
for insomnia and paranoia, and 1 point worse for 
hallucinations (predictably the hallucination scale scores 
were much lower than for the other two outcome 
variables; appendix 1).
For the mediation analyses, change in sleep over 
3 weeks explained 30% of the intervention effect on 
paranoia at 10 weeks, with change in sleep over 10 weeks 
accounting for 58% of the treatment effect on paranoia 
(table 3). Change in sleep over 3 weeks explained 21% of 
the intervention effect on hallucinations at 10 weeks, 
with change in sleep over 10 weeks accounting for 39% of 
the intervention effect on hallucinations. Hence early 
changes in sleep explain approximately half of the total 
sleep-mediated changes in psychotic experiences by the 
end of treatment. In comparison, parallel analyses in the 
opposite direction indicated that changes in psychotic

experiences explained a much smaller percentage of 
variation in improvements in sleep. Specifically, when 
paranoia and hallucination outcomes at 3 weeks were set 
as the mediators and the sleep outcome at 10 weeks 
as the main outcome, paranoia symptoms mediated 
just 3·8% of change in sleep and hallucinations mediated 
3·4% of change in sleep. These outcomes lend further 
support to the causal pathway hypothesis proposed in 
this study.
The large improvement in insomnia is confirmed with 
the ISI assessment (table 4). The sleep treatment also led 
to improvements in depression, and improvements in

anxiety, prodromal symptoms, nightmares, psychological 
wellbeing, and functioning, and all these improvements 
were maintained over time (tables 4, 5). Those participants 
randomised to the sleep treatment were also less likely to 
meet criteria over the course of the trial for a depressive 
episode, anxiety disorder, or ultra-high risk of psychosis 
(table 5). However, contact with mental health services 
did not differ between groups (table 5). Furthermore, the 
sleep treatment led to a small, sustained increase in 
symptoms of mania (table 5). With the sleep treatment, a 
greater risk also existed of meeting criteria for a manic 
episode (table 5). No adverse events were reported to 
the trial team.
Discussion
We aimed to investigate the effects on mental health of 
the reduction of sleep difficulties. The first necessary 
stage was for the intervention to reduce insomnia, which 
was achieved. A large effect size reduction was found 
with the digital CBT intervention in a large student 
population. But we designed the trial to establish the 
consequent effects on psychotic experiences. To our 
knowledge, the OASIS trial is the largest randomised 
controlled trial of a psychological intervention for a 
mental health problem. Students randomly assigned to 
the sleep intervention showed small, sustained reductions 
in paranoia and hallucinations, suggesting that disrupted 
sleep has a contributory causal role in the occurrence of 
these psychotic experiences in a specific population of 
young adults. The mediation analyses supported this 
interpretation—eg, improvements in sleep accounted for 
almost 60% of the change in paranoia after treatment. 
Insomnia might not be the largest cause of psychotic 
experiences but it is not an epiphenomenon. Hence, this 
study adds to our understanding of the causes of psychotic 
experiences and might indicate a promising route into 
the early treatment of some psychotic problems.
The focus on a sleep intervention in a young adult 
population is important. Young people with incipient 
disorders might be very reluctant to seek help for 
psychiatric problems. Trouble sleeping is a common 
complaint with little stigma. Hence, it provides a much 
more acceptable focus for a first step in a care pathway. 
The digital sleep treatment gave added benefits. 
Depression in particular, but also anxiety, psychological 
wellbeing, nightmares, and perceived functioning all

improved. The effects on anxiety and depression are 
consistent with the results of a meta-analysis.33 
Participants who received the sleep treatment in the trial 
were less likely to report symptoms at a level that met 
criteria for ultra-high risk of psychosis, depression, or 
anxiety disorder. At baseline, the frequency of positive 
screens for psychosis risk with the Prodromal 
Questionnaire was high, similar to the risk found with 
this questionnaire for adolescents referred to treatment 
services;34 this high rate will reflect the well established 
associations 
of 
sleep 
difficulties 
with 
psychotic 
experiences2,3,7,8 (ie, that participants have been selected 
for insomnia and therefore will score higher on psychosis 
measures), and also the limitations of brief self-report 
questionnaires for assessing psychosis risk. However, in 
the trial, sleep treatment did not affect contact with 
mental health services. Most participants were not in 
contact with these services so a longer follow-up period 
might be needed to truly test such effects. Furthermore, 
manic symptoms associated with the sleep treatment 
increased. This outcome might be due to an actual 
increase in problematic manic symptoms or it might 
simply reflect the overall increase in psychological 
wellbeing in the sample since the questionnaire domains 
concern cheerfulness, self-confidence, reduced need for 
sleep, increase in amount of activity, and talkativeness. 
The Altman scale has been found to correlate poorly with 
self-ratings of elation.35
Are the study results generalisable beyond a student 
population? We consider that the results are likely to 
apply to the wider adult population. We used a treatment 
developed for adults, which was not modified for 
students. The large treatment reduction in insomnia for 
the students is very similar to that found in trials with 
general adult populations,10,11,36 while previous studies36,37 
with community samples have shown self-help sleep 
treatment to reduce anxiety and depression. Nonetheless, 
only a direct comparison in a trial can definitively

determine the generalisablilty of our findings. Although 
not the primary objective of the study, the trial does 
indicate that the provision of internet-delivered CBT for 
insomnia to university students is likely to lead to 
reductions overall in insomnia, and smaller reductions in 
a number of other mental health symptoms, with benefits 
for positive psychological wellbeing too. Tailoring of the 
intervention specifically for this population could enhance 
engagement and outcome effects. Support to complete 
the intervention might well be helpful too.
Several limitations exist in the study. First, the study 
relied on self-report questionnaires, albeit validated in 
their development against clinical interviews. Similar 
change captured in rater-assessed measures would have 
strengthened confidence in the study results. Second, 
the samples tested were predominately in the non-
clinical range of psychotic experiences, restricting the 
conclusions to the less severe end of the psychosis 
spectrum. Third, the participants were self-selecting in 
responding to the invitation, which will have affected the 
representativeness of the sample. However, access to the 
study was via an Internet webpage, which is a simpler 
process than obtaining treatment from clinical services. 
The whole study could be completed in the privacy of the 
home, which means that far fewer barriers existed to 
participation than conventional patient trials. Fourth, the 
extent to which the results will generalise to the rest of 
the population is not known. Even within the student 
population, we do not know the representativeness of the 
participants. Fifth, bias in the outcome results will have 
been introduced because of the high dropout rate, 
especially in the treatment group, which is similar to 
comparable online studies.12 The results did remain 
robust against conservative assumptions in the sensitivity 
analyses about those participants who dropped out, but it 
is notable that treatment effects were greater for those 
participants who completed the sleep treatment. Finally, 
the causal argument rests on the plausible assumption 
that the sleep treatment first changes the occurrence of 
insomnia, since that was the topic of the intervention, 
but the mediation analyses in this trial based on week 10 
outcomes cannot fully capture the temporal order of 
changes or rule out reverse causation. We were able to 
show a significant amount of mediation based on the 
week 3 insomnia score as a mediator, while evidence for 
reverse causation was weak, which does follow the 
predicted temporal causal pathway. In reality, it is difficult 
in a clinical trial to capture potential temporal changes 
between mediator and outcomes, since improvements in 
paranoia and hallucinations are likely to closely parallel 
the improvement in sleep.
This work can be taken forward in several possible 
ways. Determination of the mechanisms linking 
insomnia to psychotic experiences will shed further light 
on the causes of psychosis and potentially enable 
treatment improvement.3,13 Of great clinical interest will 
be the evaluation of the effects of improving sleep for 
patients attending clinical services with ultra-high risk of 
psychosis, or established clinical psychotic experiences, 
or at the early stages of relapse. Our experience is that 
patients with psychosis value their sleep difficulties 
being appropriately addressed, that this enhances 
engagement with other treatments, and that better sleep 
can contribute to a reduction in psychotic experiences. 
Furthermore, a gap exists in mental health services 
regarding intervention for early, relatively non-specific 
presentations, and proper sleep treatment might provide 
a sensible first response. Overall, this trial indicates the 
importance of sleep difficulties for mental health in the 
general population and the need for a reconsideration in 
clinical services of the priority given to improving sleep.
