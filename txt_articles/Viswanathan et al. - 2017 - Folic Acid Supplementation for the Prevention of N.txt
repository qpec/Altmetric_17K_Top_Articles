IMPORTANCE Neural tube defects are among the most common congenital anomalies in the
United States. Periconceptional folic acid supplementation is a primary care–relevant
preventive intervention.
OBJECTIVE Toreviewtheevidenceonfolicacidsupplementationforpreventingneuraltubedefects
to inform the US Preventive Services Task Force for an updated Recommendation Statement.
DATA SOURCES MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and trial registries through January 28,
2016, with ongoing surveillance through November 11, 2016; references; experts.
STUDY SELECTION English-language studies of folic acid supplementation in women.
Excluded were poor-quality studies; studies of prepubertal girls, men, women without the
potential for childbearing, and neural tube defect recurrence; and studies conducted
in developing countries.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Two investigators independently reviewed abstracts,
full-text articles, and risk of bias of included studies. One investigator extracted data and
a second checked accuracy. Because of heterogeneity, data were not pooled.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Neural tube defects, harms of treatment (twinning,
respiratory outcomes).

CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In studies conducted before the initiation of food fortification
in the United States in 1998, folic acid supplementation provided protection against neural
tube defects. Newer postfortification studies have not demonstrated a protective association
but have the potential for misclassification and recall bias, which can attenuate the measured
association of folic acid supplementation with neural tube defects.

N
eural tube defects (NTDs) are among the most common
congenital anomalies in the United States. NTDs occur
very early in the pregnancy, with limited or no chance for
complete recovery. The Centers for Disease Control and Preven-
tionestimatedthattheaverageannualprevalenceofthe2mostcom-
mon kinds of NTDs, anencephaly and spina bifida, was 6.5 per
10 000 live births for the period from 2009 to 2011.1 Prevention is
an important medical intervention. Periconceptional folic acid
supplementation is a primary prevention intervention that can be
implemented in primary care settings.
In 2009, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) rec-
ommendedthatallwomenplanningapregnancyorcapableofpreg-
nancytakeadailysupplementcontaining0.4to0.8mgoffolicacid
(A recommendation). To inform an updated recommendation, the
evidence on benefits and harms of folic acid supplementation in
populations relevant to US primary care was reviewed.
Methods
Scope of the Review
Detailed methods and contextual information (on current intake
of folic acid from diet and other sources, effect of folic acid outside
the periconceptional period, variation in benefits by risk factors,
and supplementation benefits other than protection against neu-
ral tube defects) are available in the full evidence report available

-neural-tube-defects-preventive-medication.Figure1showstheana-
lytic framework and key questions (KQs) that guided the review.
Data Sources and Searches
We searched PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and EMBASE for
English-language articles published from database inception
through January 28, 2016. The search strategies for these
databases are listed in the eMethods in the Supplement. Unpub-
lished literature was searched for in ClinicalTrials.gov, HSRProj
(Health Services Research Projects in Progress), the World Health
Organization’
s International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and
NIH Reporter. To supplement electronic searches, the reference
lists of pertinent articles and all suggested citations from peer
reviewers were reviewed. Ongoing surveillance was conducted
after January 2016 through article alerts and targeted searches of
high-impact journals to identify major studies published in the
interim that may affect the conclusions or understanding of the evi-
dence and therefore the related USPSTF recommendation. The last
surveillance was conducted on November 11, 2016.
Study Selection
Twoinvestigatorsindependentlyreviewedtitles,abstracts,andfull-
textarticlesusingprespecifiedinclusioncriteriaforeachKQ(eTable
1 in the Supplement).
Studies were included if they focused on the use of folic acid
supplementation for the prevention of NTD-affected pregnancies
in women of childbearing age. Not included were studies of prepu-
bertal girls or men or women without the potential for childbearing
(eg, postmenopausal, genetic, uterine, or ovarian abnormalities).
We searched for studies that examined the use of folic acid supple-
mentation with or without food fortification or naturally occurring
folate for the prevention of NTDs. We also searched for studies that
examined the supplementation of micronutrients (eg, multivita-
min, iron) in combination with folic acid for the prevention of NTDs.
For all KQs, we searched for studies conducted in the United States
or in countries rated “very high”on the United Nations Human
Development Index.3
Studies were included that compared interventions with pla-
cebo, no treatment, dietary supplementation only, supplementa-
tion with prenatal vitamins without folic acid, or iron supplements
without folic acid for questions on benefits and harms and varia-
tions in subpopulations (KQs 1a, 1b, and 2a). Included studies

a. To what extent does folic acid supplementation reduce the risk for neural tube defects (NTDs)
 (first occurrence) in women of childbearing age?
b. Does the effect of folic acid supplementation on NTDs (first occurrence) differ by race or ethnicity?
c. Do the benefits of folic acid supplementation differ by dosage, timing, or duration of therapy?
2
a. Are there harms associated with folic acid supplementation to the mother, fetus, neonate, or child?
b. Do the harms of folic acid supplementation differ by dosage, timing, or duration of therapy?

supplementation only for questions about variations in benefits
and harms by dosage (KQs 1b, 1c, and 2b).
Studies were sought that reported on the benefits of folic acid

For benefits and harms (KQs 1 and 2), randomized clinical trials
(RCTs), nonrandomized controlled trials, cohort studies, case-
control studies, and systematic reviews were included. Addition-
ally, for harms (KQs 2a and 2b), registry data were included.
Tworeviewersduallyreviewedthequalityofallstudiesincluded
inthe2009reportthatmettheinclusioncriteriaforthecurrentreview
and resolved disagreement by discussion and consensus.
Data Extraction and Quality Assessment
For each included study, one investigator extracted information
aboutmethods,patientpopulation,intervention,comparator,out-
comes, timing, setting, and study design, and a second investiga-
tor reviewed for completeness and accuracy. Two independent in-
vestigators assessed the quality of each study as good, fair, or poor,
usingpredefinedcriteriadevelopedbytheUSPSTFandadaptedfor
this topic (eTables 2, 3, 4, and 5 in the Supplement).
Disagreements were resolved by discussion and consensus.
Issues leading to a judgment of poor quality included the risk of
misclassification bias from retrospective recall of level and timing
of exposure; the risk of selection bias from not identifying all
cases of the outcome, including fetal deaths; and the risk of con-
founding from not appropriately accounting for factors such as
infertility that might influence both exposure to folic acid supple-
mentation and the outcome of twinning. Studies with 1 or more of
these features were rated as poor quality. Other flaws that
resulted in poor-quality ratings included initially assembled
groups not close to being comparable or maintained throughout
the study (including overall attrition of at least 20% or differential
attrition of at least 15% between groups); use of unreliable or
invalid measurement instruments or unequal application among
groups (including not masking outcome assessment); and, for
RCTs, the lack of intention-to-treat analysis.
Data Synthesis and Analysis
Findings for each KQ were qualitatively synthesized by summariz-
ing the characteristics and results of included studies in tabular or
narrative format. To determine whether meta-analyses were ap-
propriate, the clinical and methodological heterogeneity (in popu-
lation, interventions, and outcomes) of the studies were assessed
following established guidance.4
Results
A total of 5786 titles and abstracts and 757 full-text articles were
screened (Figure 2). Of the 32 good- or fair-quality articles on pri-
mary studies or systematic reviews, 205-24 addressed KQ1a, 36,7,20

neity across studies and over time, results were not pooled.

A total of 20 publications were found on the question of ben-

was an RCT initiated in 1984 and terminated in 1992, with informa-
tion collected through 1993. Three publications relate to 2 cohort
studies; one was a Hungarian cohort study of women recruited be-
tween 1993 and 1996,14 and the second was a cohort drawn from
women who underwent α-fetoprotein screening or amniocentesis
between1984and1987.18,19Allotherstudieswerecase-controlstud-

Evidence From Trials
OneRCT,describedin7publications,8-13,15randomized5453women
in Hungary preconceptionally to a vitamin supplement containing
folic acid or a trace-element supplement (Table 1). The trial re-
ported no cases of NTDs in the experimental group and 6 cases in
the control group (0% vs 0.25%; 25 fewer cases per 10 000 [95%
CI, 3-47 fewer]; P = .01 by Fisher exact test; Peto odds ratio [OR],
0.13 [95% CI, 0.03-0.65]).
Evidence From Cohort Studies
At the conclusion of the RCT described above, no additional RCT
was considered ethically possible because of the clear benefits of
folic acid supplementation. The authors continued their investiga-
tion using the same intervention in a cohort of 6112 women drawn

from the Hungarian Periconceptional Service (1993 to 1996), with
supplementation provided before conception (Table 1).14 When
compared with outcomes for unsupplemented pregnant women,
the adjusted OR of an NTD-affected pregnancy for supplemented
women was 0.11 (95% CI, 0.01-0.91; 0% vs 0.29%; 29 fewer cases
per 10 000 [95% CI, 9-50 fewer]).14 A cohort study of 23 491
women in New England undergoing α-fetoprotein screening or
amniocentesis between weeks 15 and 20 of gestation (1984 to
1987) defined exposure as the use of at least 1 multivitamin con-
taining folic acid per week, between weeks 1 and 6 following con-
ception (Table 2). Use of multivitamins containing folic acid was
associated with an OR for NTD-affected pregnancy of 0.27 (95%
CI, 0.11-0.63; 0.09% vs 0.35%, 26 fewer cases per 10 000 [95%

Evidence From Case-Control Studies
Case-control studies included multistate, 2-state, and single-state
sources(Table2).TwoincludedpublicationsusedtheNationalBirth
Defects Prevention Study,5,6 which was established in 1997 and in-
cludes population-based birth defects surveillance systems in 10
sites. Eight of 10 surveillance sites include live births, fetal deaths,
and elective pregnancy terminations, thus mitigating, but not en-
tirely eliminating, the risk of selection bias.5 Women were asked to
recall use of multivitamins or supplements from 3 months before
pregnancythroughthelastmonthofpregnancy,resultinginamaxi-
mumrecallperiodof3years.Bothpublicationsareconsistentindem-
onstrating a lack of association of folic acid supplementation with
benefits (adjusted OR for anencephaly and spina bifida, 0.93 [95%
CI,0.82-1.06]5;adjustedORforanencephaly,1.2[95%CI,0.8-1.9]5,6).
ThreeincludedstudieswerebasedondatafromtheSloneBirth
DefectsStudyandwerepublishedin1993,222001,16and2011.7The
Slone Birth Defects Study began in 1976. It identified cases, largely
from hospital discharge records; randomly selected controls; and
identified exposure to folic acid supplements through an interview
conducted within 6 months of delivery going back to 6 months be-
fore pregnancy. Over the course of several decades, the list of in-
cluded sites and sources changed. The definition of exposure var-
ied by publication, and the period of recall ranged from 15 to 17
months.The1993and2001publicationsreliedondatafromtheera
before food fortification and consistently demonstrated that daily
use of supplements was associated with a lower risk of NTDs com-
pared with nonuse (adjusted OR of 0.7 [level of precision here and
belowasreportedbyauthors][95%CI,0.5-0.8]inthe2001study16;
adjustedORof0.6[95%CI,0.4-0.8]inthe1993study22).The2011
Slone Birth Defects Study found no association of folic acid supple-
mentation with the risk of spina bifida, regardless of the level of
supplementation.7
Two other studies were conducted in the era before food for-
tification. Both studies drew on data from the California Birth De-
fectsMonitoringprogram,usingcasesfrom1985to198717and1989
to1991.20OnestudyadditionallydrewondatafromIllinois(alsofrom
1985 to 1987, the NICHD Neural Tube Defects Study).17 Recall peri-
ods ranged from 13 to 17 months. The NICHD Neural Tube Defects
StudyreportednoassociationofsupplementswithNTDs(OR,1.00
[95% CI, 0.73-1.40]; P = .97).17 The study of California-only data
foundanORof0.65(95%CI,0.45-0.94)foranyuseinthe3months

Onecase-controlstudyfromalimiteddatasourcecollecteddata
from January 1995 to February 1999 from 148 Mexican American
women living along the Texas-Mexico border with NTD-affected
pregnancies and 158 control women with normal live births.21 The

ningtheerasbeforeandafterfoodfortification,foundanonsignifi-

education, obesity, and previous stillbirth or miscarriage, the direc-
tion of effect altered (adjusted OR, 1.12 [95% CI, 0.22-5.78; P value
not reported).
Key Question 1b. Does the effect of folic acid supplementation on
NTDs (first occurrence) differ by race or ethnicity?
Three case-control studies provide limited information about
the effects of folic acid supplementation by racial and ethnic char-
acteristics (eTable 6 in the Supplement).6,7,20 The Slone Birth De-
fectsStudy(1998to2008)foundnopositiveassociationwithperi-
conceptional folic acid supplementation for white women and a
possible increased risk of spina bifida among consistent supple-
ment users of Hispanic ethnicity when compared with nonusers7;
however, the authors note that this finding may be attributable to
chance.
The National Birth Defects Prevention Study (1998 to 2003)
foundthatpericonceptionalsupplementusewasnotassociatedwith
alowerriskofhavingapregnancyaffectedbyanNTD,andtherewere
no differences in the effects of folic acid supplementation by race
orethnicity.6TheCaliforniaBirthDefectsMonitoringProgramStudy
foundthatwomenwhousedanyfolicacid–containingvitamininthe
3 months before conception had a lower risk of having an NTD-
affectedpregnancy.20ReductioninriskforHispanicswasofsmaller
magnitude than that observed for non-Hispanic whites and blacks,
buttheseresultswerenotstatisticallysignificantandcouldhaveoc-
curred because of chance.
Key Question 1c. Do the benefits of folic acid supplementation dif-
fer by dosage, timing, or duration of therapy?
One cohort study18,19 and 6 case-control studies6,7,17,20-22 pro-
vided information on the effects of dosage (eTable 7 in the
Supplement) and timing (eTable 8 in the Supplement) of folic acid
supplementation on NTDs. Four studies (1 cohort study19 and 3
case-control studies17,20,22) reported on dose of folic acid supple-
mentation. Five studies (1 cohort study18 and 4 case-control
studies6,7,20,21) reported on timing of folic acid supplementation. All
included studies on dose predate the food-fortification era17,19,20,22
and generally failed to find a dose-response effect. An exception
was the Slone Birth Defects Study (1988 to 1991),22 which sug-
gested lower odds of NTDs with daily use vs less than daily use (OR,
0.57 [95% CI, 0.35-0.93]). Older studies on timing consistently
show no effect, whereas newer studies varied, with 1 study
(postfortification)6 showing a protective association with use
before pregnancy on anencephaly but not spina bifida and the
other not finding a protective association for spina bifida.7
Harms of Folic Acid Supplementation
KeyQuestion2a.Arethereharmsassociatedwithfolicacidsupple-
mentation to the mother, fetus, neonate, or child?
One RCT11 and 1 cohort study31 provided information on twin-
ning (Table 3). In a Hungarian trial comparing folic acid supplemen-
tationwithamultivitamintotraceelementsamonginformativepreg-
nancies(definedaslivebirthsandstillbirths[latefetaldeaths]),the
proportion of twin pregnancies and twin births was not statistically
significantly different between the 2 groups. Of the total pregnan-
cies in the multivitamin group, 1.9% (46/2421) were determined to
be twin gestations, compared with 1.4% (32/2346) of pregnancies
in the trace element group (OR, 1.40 [95% CI, 0.89-2.21]; 54 more
cases per 10 000 [95% CI, 18 fewer to 125 more]). The proportion
of twin births (as opposed to pregnancies) was higher in the multi-
vitamin group (93/2468 [3.8%]) than in the trace element group
(64/2378 [2.7%]; OR, 1.41 [95% CI, 1.03-1.96]; 108 more cases per
10 000 [95% CI, 8 more to 207 more]). In a subgroup analysis of
womenreceivingfertilitydrugs,thetrialfoundnodifferenceintwin-
ning between the 2 groups.11 A prospective cohort study found an

Thestudyfoundnostatisticallysignificantdifferencesinthereport-

pregnancy through pregnancy confirmation.
KeyQuestion2b.Dotheharmsoffolicacidsupplementationdiffer
by dosage, timing, or duration of therapy?
One study separated the study population into tertiles of fo-
late taken as vitamin supplements (<0.2 mg/d, 0.2 to 0.499 mg/d,
and �0.5 mg/d) and compared the second and third tertiles to the
first for the incidence of any allergic disease, sensitization, recur-
rent wheezing, eczema, food reactions, IgE-mediated food allergy,
andsensitizationtofoodallergens(eTable9intheSupplement).All
results had wide confidence intervals spanning or overlapping the
line of no difference.36
Two of the cohort studies included in a previously published
meta-analysis26 examined the association between prenatal use of
a supplement containing folic acid (compared with no use) in the
second or third trimester and asthma or wheezing in childhood
(eTable 10 in the Supplement).25,27 Of the 15 associations evaluated
across 2 studies, only 1 association was significantly increased (ad-
justed prevalence ratio for maternal report of wheezing at 1 year,
1.20 [95% CI, 1.04-1.39]).25 Three cohort studies examined the use
of supplements containing folic acid during the second or third tri-
mester and risk of other allergic outcomes.25,27,33 The meta-
analysis reported no significant findings in 38 reported associations
across these 3 studies.26
A meta-analysis examined the incidence of asthma and
wheezing by timing of supplementation (prepregnancy, early
pregnancy, other period in pregnancy).35 Four of 5 reported asso-
ciations showed no statistically significant association of folic acid
supplementation with asthma or wheezing in childhood. The 1
statistically significant association with wheezing in childhood
was associated with exposure in early pregnancy (relative risk,
1.06 [95% CI, 1.02-1.09]).27-29
Discussion
A summary of findings in this evidence review is found in Table 4
and Table 5. Most of the studies included in this review have
broad eligibility criteria; their participants are representative of
the US primary care population. Early studies (1 trial, cohort and
case-control studies) provided consistent evidence of benefit.
After the publication of the Hungarian trial and other trials in
women with recurrent NTDs (not included in this review), the evi-
dence of benefit pointed to the need for large-scale public health
interventions; the United States initiated the addition of folate to
grain products in 1998.41 The evidence of benefit also made the
conduct of additional trials unethical. As a consequence, all sub-
sequent studies relied on observational data using case-control
designs. These case-control studies do not show a protective
association.
Therewasnoconsistentevidenceofvariationinbenefitsforsub-
populations or by dose or timing. There was also no consistent evi-
dence of an increased risk of twinning or childhood respiratory ill-
nesses or variation in these outcomes by timing or dose.
Although the effect of food fortification may explain lack of
benefit in more recent studies, study design flaws and inadequate
sample size in these studies are also important considerations. All
included observational studies in this review contain inherent and
unavoidable sources of bias. Prospective cohort studies may not
be able to ascertain all NTD cases. Retrospective studies have a
risk of recall bias. In the case-control studies included in this
review, women were asked to recall frequency and dose of
supplements over a relatively short period of exposure (around
the time of conception) occurring between 13 months and 3 years
prior to the interview. Both of the risks of bias described above
(case ascertainment and recall) will reduce the differences
between study groups. The relative rarity of the outcome and the
difficulty of adequately powering studies also complicates the
interpretation of the results.
An additional consideration in weighing the relative contribu-
tions of folic acid supplementation and food fortification is the
extent of benefit provided by food fortification. Estimates of
folate sufficiency of intake vary widely by measure. When the
highest threshold, the recommended usual intake of 0.4 mg/d, is
used, National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data
from 2003 to 2006 suggest that 76% of nonpregnant women
aged 15 to 44 years did not consume the recommended daily
intake. Among all women, the median intake of folic acid overall
was 0.245 mg/d.42 The proportion of women not consuming the
recommended usual intake varies from 70 to 91% by race and
ethnicity.
Rather than using a daily 400-μg dosage to define adequate
intake, another approach is to set the threshold for insufficiency
based on red blood cell folate concentrations. A threshold of
400 ng/mL (906 nmol/L) or more is based on an association of
the threshold with an NTD prevalence of more than 9 per 10 000
live births. This threshold yields an estimate suggesting a lower
level of insufficiency, on average, with 22.8% of nonpregnant
women aged 12 to 49 years having suboptimal red blood cell
folate concentrations for NTD prevention.43 Levels vary by use of
dietary supplements containing folic acid, consumption of man-

Very few women exceed the upper level for folic acid con-
sumption (1000 μg/d). According to the 2015 Dietary Guideline
Advisory Committee report, less than 3% of women aged 14 to
50 years were getting more than 1000 μg/d from food, bever-
ages, and dietary supplements, based on National Health and
Nutrition Examination Study data collected from 2007-2010.44

garding the overall quality of evidence, ethical considerations limit

Conclusions
In studies conducted before the initiation of food fortification in
the United States in 1998, folic acid supplementation provided
protection against neural tube defects. Newer postfortification
studies have not demonstrated a protective association but have
the potential for misclassification and recall bias, which can
attenuate the measured association of folic acid supplementation
with neural tube defects.
