The vasculature influences the progression and resolution of tissue inflammation. Capillaries express
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors, including neuropilins (NRPs), which regulate
interstitial fluid flow. NRP2, a receptor of VEGFA and semaphorin (SEMA) 3F ligands, is expressed in the
vascular and lymphatic endothelia. Previous studies have demonstrated that blocking VEGF receptor 2
attenuates VEGFA-induced vascular permeability. The inhibition of NRP2 was hypothesized to
decrease vascular permeability as well. Unexpectedly, massive tissue swelling and edema were observed
in Nrp2�/� mice compared with wild-type littermates after delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions.
Vascular permeability was twofold greater in inflamed blood vessels in Nrp2-deficient mice compared to
those in Nrp2-intact littermates. The addition of exogenous SEMA3F protein inhibited vascular
permeability in Balb/cJ mice, suggesting that the loss of endogenous Sema3F activity in the Nrp2-
deficient mice was responsible for the enhanced vessel leakage. Functional lymphatic capillaries are
necessary for draining excess fluid after inflammation; however, Nrp2-mutant mice lacked superficial
lymphatic capillaries, leading to 2.5-fold greater fluid retention and severe lymphedema after
inflammation. In conclusion, Nrp2 deficiency increased blood vessel permeability and decreased
lymphatic vessel drainage during inflammation, highlighting the importance of the NRP2/SEMA3F
pathway in the modulation of tissue swelling and resolution of postinflammatory edema. (Am J Pathol

The endothelium plays a crucial role in inflammatory
reactions within tissues, and chronic inflammatory diseases
(eg,
psoriasis,
eczema)
are
associated
with
neo-
vascularization. The vasculature mediates two phases of
acute inflammation: the leakage phase, modulated by
endothelial cells (ECs), which results in edema and
swelling, and the drainage phase, controlled by lymphatic
ECs (LECs), which clears interstitial fluid and results in
resolution and return to homeostasis.1 The cutaneous
delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) assay (also called the
contact hypersensitivity assay) has been routinely used for
studying the inflammatory endothelium. Inflamed vessels
undergo remodeling characterized by increased perme-
ability, increased flow, and an influx of immune cells.2 The
vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs) A and C
pathways are known to be pivotal in regulating vascular
permeability and lymphatic drainage, respectively, during
inflammation.3e6

Neuropilins (NRPs) are transmembrane coreceptors that
mediate both stimulatory signals from VEGF family pro-
teins and inhibitory signals from class 3 semaphorin
(SEMA3) ligands.10e12 ECs express two NRP receptors,
NRP1 and NRP2, during development.11,13 NRP1 is
essential for angiogenesis and cardiovascular development,
and Nrp1-knockout (KO) mice die in utero from vascular
defects.13,14 NRP2 is expressed in capillary (and venous)
ECs of the blood and lymphatic system and is not required
for developmental angiogenesis.13,15 Nrp2-deficient mice
survive to adulthood and are fertile but smaller in size than
are wild-type (WT) littermates.16,17 Nrp2�/� embryos have
fewer lymphatic vessels than do Nrp2þ/þ embryos but do
not show overt signs of edema.15,18
Few studies have analyzed the physiologic function of
the NRP2 receptor in ECs or LECs beyond developmental
stages; however, mutations in the human NRP2 gene have
been found in families with primary lymphedema.19
Normally, NRP2 is down-regulated or absent in adult
quiescent capillaries, but NRP2 can be up-regulated
during ischemia.20,21 Since NRP2 is a mediator of the
VEGFA and VEGFC pathways12,22,23 and is expressed in
both ECs and LECs, we hypothesized that NRP2 may
play a role in the regulation of fluid dynamics after
inflammation during both the leakage and drainage
phases. We predicted that inhibiting NRP2 would have
effects similar to inhibiting VEGFR2 since both are
coreceptors for VEGFA. However, our results show

permeable.
Additionally,
we
demonstrate
that
adult
Nrp2-mutant mice show extensive lymphedema under
inflammatory conditions. These phenotypes are due to the
promiscuous nature of the Nrp2 receptor, which also
binds to Sema3F, an endogenous angiogenesis and
lymphangiogenesis inhibitor.24,25
Materials and Methods
Mice
All mice were maintained under specific pathogen-free
conditions in a facility accredited by the Association for
Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care.
The care and experimental procedures were conducted in
compliance with the NIH’s Guide for the Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals26 and were approved by the Institu-
tional Animal Care and Use Committee at Boston Chil-
dren’s Hospital (Boston, MA).
Nrp2þ/LacZ mice were a gift from Dr. Seiji Takashima
(Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka,
Japan).27 These mice were generated by replacing the first
coding exon of Nrp2 with a promoterless Escherichia coli
b-galactosidase gene. These mice were backcrossed to
the C57BL/6J strain for >10 generations. Nrp2Lacz/LacZ pups
die soon after birth. Nrp2þ/LacZ mice are of normal size
and
weight
and
are
indistinguishable
from
Nrp2þ/þ
littermates.
Nrp2þ/gfp mice (also known as Nrp2tm1.2Mom/MomJ; stock
number 006700) were purchased from The Jackson Labo-
ratory (Bar Harbor, ME) and maintained in the C57BL/6J
background. Nrp2gfp/gfp mice (functionally referred to as
Nrp2�/� mice) are viable, fertile, and nonedematous at
baseline. C57BL/6J and Balb/cJ mice were purchased from
The Jackson Laboratory.
DTH Assay
DTH reactions were induced in the ears of female mice
(n Z 5 mice per group) at 8 to 12 weeks of age, as previ-
ously described.28 DTH was performed on several strains,
including Balb/cJ; C57BL/6J; Nrp2þ/LacZ and the resultant
offspring from Nrp2þ/gfp � Nrp2þ/gfp matings, including
Nrp2þ/þ (WT), Nrp2þ/gfp (heterozygous, called Nrp2þ/�),
and Nrp2gfp/gfp (KO, called Nrp2�/�). Mice were sensitized
by
the
topical
application
of
a
2%
oxazolone
(4-ethoxymethylene-2
phenyl-2-oxazoline-5-one;
Sigma-
Aldrich, St Louis, MO) solution in acetone/olive oil (4:1
vol/vol) to the shaved abdomen (50 mL) and to each paw
(5 mL). Mice were challenged on the right ear 5 days after
sensitization (day 0) by topical application of a 1% oxazo-
lone solution (20 mL total; 10 mL on each side of the right
ear), and left ears were treated with vehicle alone. The
thicknesses of vehicle- and oxazolone-treated ears were
measured using a Mitutoyo gauge, daily for up to 10 days,
as described for the mouse ear-swelling test.29 The increase
in ear thickness over the baseline thickness (measured in
microns) was used as a measurement of the extent of
inflammation and plotted versus time. The experiment
comparing WT, heterozygous, and KO mice was repeated
three times.
Miles Assay
Miles assays were performed on female Balb/cJ mice (n Z 4
mice per group) at 8 weeks of age. Mice were shaved 1 day
before the experiment. Mice were anesthetized with tri-
bromoethanol delivered i.p. Evans Blue dye (100 mL of a 1%
solution in normal saline) was injected via the tail vein. After
10 minutes, proteins (50 mL) or vehicle were injected s.c. to
induce permeability, including phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS), recombinant human VEGFA165 (200 ng/mL Z 4.76
nmol/L) (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), recombinant
human VEGFA165 (4.76 nmol/L) plus SEMA3F (95 nmol/L;
20-fold
excess),

and recombinant human VEGFA165 (4.76 nmol/L) plus bev-
acizumab (950 nmol/L; 200-fold excess) (Genentech, South
San Francisco, CA). SEMA3F protein was purified as previ-
ously described.30 After 20 minutes, the mice were euthanized
in a CO2 chamber, and the area of skin that included the
extravasated dyewasexcisedandimaged.EvansBluedyewas
extracted from the skin pieces by incubation in formamide at
room temperature for 5 days. The absorbance at 620 nm was
measured using a spectrophotometer. This experiment was
repeated three independent times with 4 mice per group in the
first two experiments and 3 mice per group in the third
experiment, for a total of 11 mice per group. The means
� SEM of each experiment were plotted and compared.
Modified
Miles
assays
were
performed
on
the
female, adult (8- to 12-week-old) resultant offspring from
Nrp2þ/gfp � Nrp2þ/gfp matings, including Nrp2þ/þ (WT),
Nrp2þ/� (heterozygous), and Nrp2�/� (KO), on day 2 after
DTH (n Z 3 mice per group). Evans Blue dye (100 mL of a
1% solution in normal saline) was injected via the tail vein.
Dye leaked from blood vessels into the interstitial space in
the challenged ears; vehicle-treated ears were used as con-
trols. WT mice not undergoing DTH reactions were injected
in the ear with recombinant human VEGFA165 as a positive
control. Extravasated dye was quantified in a spectropho-
tometer (620 nm).
Lymphangiography
Evans Blue dye (10 mL of a 1% solution in normal saline)
was injected into the tip of vehicle-treated or oxazolone-
challenged ears on the 3rd day after DTH in isoflurane-
anesthetized Balb/cJ mice (n Z 5 mice). Mice were
imaged
within
5
minutes
for

visualization
of
lymphatic vessels.
Dye-retention experiments were performed as described.6
Evans Blue dye (5 mL of a 1% solution in normal saline)
was injected into the tip of oxazolone-challenged ears on the
4th day after DTH in isoflurane-anesthetized Nrp2þ/þ or
Nrp2�/� mice (n Z 5 mice per group). After 16 hours, the
mice were euthanized, and ear pieces of equal area were
incubated in formamide for the extraction of the dye. After
48 hours, the absorbance was measured in a spectropho-
tometer at 620 nm.
Tissue Staining
Tissues were embedded in OCT compound and frozen in
liquid nitrogen. Cryosections (8 mm) were fixed in cold
acetone for 5 minutes and washed with PBS. Endogenous
peroxidases were blocked in a 3% H2O2 solution in methanol
for 12 minutes and washed with PBS. Endogenous proteins
were blocked with Tris-HCl, NaCl blocking buffer (Perki-
nElmer, Waltham, MA) for 20 minutes at room temperature.

and counterstained with hematoxylin (Sigma-Aldrich).
Nrp2þ/LacZ mice cryosections were fixed in cold methanol
for 5 minutes. b-Galactosidase activity was detected by
incubation in X-gal reagent [1 mg/mL 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-

ette, MO) in dimethyl sulfoxide, 5 mmol/L K3Fe(CN)6, 5
mmol/L K4Fe(CN)6, 2 mmol/L MgCl2 in PBS (pH 6.5)]
overnight at 37�C. Sections were washed in PBS and
counterstained in eosin (Sigma-Aldrich).
Paraffin sections (4 mm) were dewaxed in xylene and
rehydrated through a graded series of ethanol (100%, 95%,
70%, 50%) to water. Endogenous peroxidases and proteins
were blocked as described in the previous paragraph. Sec-
tions were incubated overnight at 4�C in rabbit anti-
SEMA3F antibody,31 rabbit monoclonal anti-mouse Nrp2
antibody (catalog number 3366; Cell Signaling, Beverly,
MA), or Syrian hamster anti-mouse podoplanin (ReliaTech)
in Tris-HCl, NaCl blocking buffer. The next day, tissues
were washed in PBS and incubated in biotinylated goat anti-
rabbit IgG or anti-hamster IgG (Vector Laboratories) for
1 hour. Sections were washed in PBS and incubated with
either horseradish peroxidaseeconjugated avidin (Vectas-

Results
Inflammation Induces Tissue Swelling, Edema, and
Nrp2 Up-Regulation
DTH reactions in C57BL/6J mice resulted in tissue swelling
that reached maximal levels by 1 day after challenge and
caused hyperplasia and remodeling by day 3 (Figure 1,
A and B). Inflammation-induced vascular permeability was
evident by increased redness and swelling in the challenged
ears
(Supplemental
Figure
S1A).
Lymphangiography

ears

to

ears
(Supplemental
Figure S1B).32 Immunoblot analysis of C57BL/6J mice
ear proteins after DTH showed nearly twofold increased
expression of Nrp2 by day 1 and nearly threefold by days 5
to 7 (Figure 1C). Moreover, Nrp2 expression (b-galactosi-
dase activity) was up-regulated in inflamed endothelium in
Nrp2þ/LacZ mice (Figure 1D). Nrp2 is expressed in both
vascular ECs and LECs (Supplemental Figure S1C). Nrp2
was found in inflamed blood capillaries (Figure 1E) and
colocalized with podoplanin staining on lymphatic vessels
after inflammation (Figure 1F). Noninflamed adult mouse
ears expressed Nrp2 only in melanocytes of hair follicles
(Figure 1D), not in capillaries, consistent with findings from
previous reports.20,21,33 Nrp2 expression was absent in
quiescent adult vasculature (Figure 1D) and in Nrp2�/�
mouse ear sections (Figure 1G).
Nrp2 Regulates Vascular Permeability and Edema
Adult female Nrp2 KO and WT mice have ears of equal
thickness (data not shown), suggesting that Nrp2-deficient
mice are not normally edematous. In unchallenged ears,
vascular permeability was slightly (but not significantly)
greater
in Nrp2�/� vessels
than in
Nrp2þ/þ vessels
(Figure 2, A and B). However, on day 2 after inflammation,
vascular leakage in inflamed ears, as measured by a modi-
fied Miles assay, was double in Nrp2 KO mice compared to
WT mice (Figure 2, A and B). Thus, Nrp2 deficiency
increased edema due to increased vascular permeability.
NRP2 binds inhibitory SEMA3F proteins as well as
VEGF proteins.34,35 We hypothesized that the edema seen
in inflamed Nrp2�/� mice may have been due to the lack of
endogenous
Sema3F
signaling.

endogenous
Sema3F expression in normal mouse skin epithelium but not
in endothelium or fibroblasts (Supplemental Figure S1,

controls for immunostaining (Supplemental Figure S1F).32
Additionally,
exogenous
SEMA3F
protein
inhibited
vascular permeability in the skin in VEGFA-induced Miles
assays in WT mice (Figure 2, C and D). At equal doses,
SEMA3F protein was as effective as bevacizumab, a

antibody,
in
blocking
vascular
permeability.
Nrp2 Deficiency Prolongs Swelling and Lymphedema
DTH reactions in Nrp2þ/þ, Nrp2þ/�, and Nrp2�/� mice
displayed maximal swelling by day 1 (Figure 3A). In WT
and heterozygous mice, swelling was resolved within 4 to
5 days, while Nrp2 KO mice exhibited significantly
increased swelling and delayed resolution between 2 and
10 days (Figure 3A). Tissue thickness and hyperplasia
were increased in Nrp2 KO compared to WT mice
(Figure 3B). Increased interstitial fluid pressure causes
anchoring filaments to open junctions in LEC capillaries to
allow for fluid uptake.36 In normal mouse ears, lymphatic
capillaries (identified by lymphatic vessel endothelial hy-
aluronic acid receptor 1epositive staining) were present
below the epidermis and in the subcutis near cartilage
(Figure 3C and Supplemental Figure S1G). Nrp2-deficient
mice, on the other hand, lacked a superficial lymphatic
capillary
plexus
(Figure
3C
and
Supplemental
Figure S1H). Lack of lymphatic capillaries was likely
due to guidance and sprouting defects during develop-
ment,
as
evidenced
by
embryonic
skin
sections
(Supplemental Figure S1, I and J) and previous re-
ports.15,18 In fact, the mean depth below the epidermis to
the nearest lymphatic capillary in embryonic day 18 skin
was 2.5-fold greater in Nrp2-deficient mice than in WT
mice (P < 0.001) (Figure 3E). This distance increased to
5-fold
greater
in
inflamed
adult
Nrp2-deficient
ears
compared to WT ears (P < 0.001) (Figure 3D). The
lymphatic capillary number was nearly half in adult Nrp2
KO mice compared to WT mice after DTH (region of
interest defined as the dorsal side of the ear in each 100�
field; mean vessels per area, 4 � 1 in KO versus 7.5 � 1 in
WT). Additionally, both groups had dilated, open-lumened
lymphatic vessels with similar total lymphatic capillary
area per region of interest (WT, 5831 � 1711 pixels2; KO,
6655 � 3079 pixels2). Although the mean luminal areas of
each lymphatic capillary were quite heterogeneous, in both
groups there was a trend toward larger individual capil-
laries in the Nrp2 KO mice compared to WT mice; how-
ever, the difference did not reach statistical significance
(WT, 897 � 1375 pixels2; KO, 1663 � 1377 pixels2;
P Z 0.2). Therefore, the location of the capillary within
the dermis dictated the overall drainage of the tissue bed.

 This difference in lymphatic structure and organization
within the ear resulted in a 2.5-fold retention of fluid or
functional lack of drainage, as measured by lymphangi-
ography, in Nrp2 KO mice compared to WT mice
(P < 0.05) (Figure 3F).
Discussion
VEGFA stimulates EC leakage, and VEGFC stimulates
LEC drainage.3,5 NRP2 is a receptor of both VEGFA and
VEGFC12,23; therefore, the deletion of NRP2 in vivo is

 predicted to inhibit leakage and drainage. However, our
results demonstrate that the system is more complicated.
Inflammation increases VEGFA,7 which causes EC to
leak, resulting in edema.3 VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 have been
reported to be up-regulated in vessels after inflammation.37
We report that the Nrp2 receptor is also up-regulated after
inflammation. Previous studies have shown that blocking
VEGFR1/VEGFR2 or Nrp1 in a DTH model resulted in
reduced
edema.3,5,28
Therefore,
we
hypothesized
that
blocking Nrp2 would lower edema since it is a coreceptor for
VEGFA.12 Nrp2-deficient mice showed no signs of edema
before inflammation, yet once challenged, they responded
with massive and prolonged edema. Our data suggest that
NRP2 is a unique VEGFR in inflammatory endothelium.
NRP2 mediates both the VEGF and SEMA3F pathways.
The inhibitory effect of Sema3F/Nrp2 in EC permeability
(Figure 2, C and D) is in sharp contrast to the stimulatory
effect of SEMA3A/Nrp1 in EC permeability reported pre-
viously.38 Our Sema3F immunostaining data (Supplemental
Figure S1E) are in agreement with those from previous
mRNA staining39 and suggest that Sema3F is constitutively
produced in the epidermis and acts, in a paracrine fashion,
as an endogenous damper of inflammation and edema.
SEMA3F protein has been shown to compete with VEGFA
on NRP235 and to inhibit EC functions.33,40,41 Loss of the
functional Sema3F receptor, Nrp2, increased edema and
lymphedema after inflammation. This conclusion is based
on findings from previous structural studies that have sug-
gested that VEGFA binds between NRP receptor and
VEGFR2 in a bridge formation.11,42,43 Additionally, an
in vitro study showed that the addition of NRP2 to cells
expressing VEGFR2 increases phosphorylation in response

 to VEGFA stimulation compared to cells expressing
VEGFR2 alone.12
An alternative explanation is that NRP2 acts as a decoy
receptor for VEGFA and sequesters VEGFA away from
VEGFR2. When NRP2 is deficient, as in the case of the
Nrp2 KO mice, there could be an increase in the total
bioavailable VEGFA in the microenvironment, which could
then signal via VEGFR2 more readily to increase perme-
ability. In WT mice, increased Sema3F expression could
compete with VegfA for Nrp2 binding and thereby free up
VegfA to bind to VegfR2, again resulting in increased
permeability. This
alternative explanation negates
the
inhibitory role of SEMA3F signaling via NRP2 and plexin,
and is therefore less likely in our opinion.
Little is known about the regulation of NRP2 and/or
SEMA3F in vivo. NRP2 expression is under the regulation of
the transcription factors GATA2 and LMO2 (LIM domain
only 2) during development.22 Hypoxia has been reported to
inhibit the expression of NRP2,44 whereas hyperoxia in a
retinal ischemia model resulted in augmented NRP2 expres-
sion.45 Other factors speculated to regulate NRP2 may include
superoxides,46e48 nitric oxide,49 growth factors such as
Figure 3
Prolonged inflammation and lymphedema in mice lacking neuropilin (Nrp)-2. A: Ear swelling versus time after delayed-type hypersensitivity
(DTH) reactions in Nrp2þ/þ [wild type (WT); circle], Nrp2þ/� [heterozygous (HET); triangle], and Nrp2�/� [knockout (KO); square] mice (representative of
three independent experiments). B: Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining of ear sections from WT (bottom panel) or Nrp2 KO (top panel) mice after DTH
(day 4). Nrp2�/� ears are thicker than WT littermate ears; swelling is more pronounced in the outer ear. C: Cryosections stained for lymphatic vessel
endothelial hyaluronic acid receptor (LYVE)-1 (red) 1 day after challenge reveal lymphatic capillaries. Ear sections from WT mice (left panel) show dilated
superficial lymphatic capillaries near the epidermis (arrows) and in the deeper dermis near the cartilage. Nrp2 KO mice (right panel) show only deeper
lymphatic vessels and lack superficial capillaries. D and E: The distance from the epidermis to the nearest lymphatic capillary was measured in inflamed ears
in adult mice (D) and in normal embryonic day 18 (E18) skin (E). Lymphatic capillaries were 5-fold deeper in the inflamed ears and 2.5-fold deeper in
normal embryonic skin. F: The retention of Evans Blue dye was quantified after 16 hours in WT and Nrp2 KO ears on day 4 after DTH. Lymphatic drainage was
2.5-fold less in the Nrp2 KO mice compared to that in the WT mice. Data are expressed as means � SEM. n Z 5 mice per group (A and F); n Z 4 mice per
group (D and E). *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, and ***P < 0.001. Scale bars Z 100 mm.

Zinc finger E-boxebinding homeobox 1 and inhibitor of
DNA-binding protein 2 have been shown to down-regulate
SEMA3F in tumor cells,30,53 but SEMA3F regulation in
normal epithelial cells and its effects on ECs and vascular
permeability are unclear.
Interstitial fluid pressure causes junctions in LECs to
open and allows for fluid uptake in capillaries, whereas
ducts do not take up fluid. The prolonged lymphedema in
Nrp2 KO mice is likely due to architectural defects from
improper LEC sprouting during development and the lack of
a superficial lymphatic capillary plexus necessary for
competent fluid drainage, in agreement with findings from
previous studies.15,18 Nrp2 deficiency phenocopied the
effect of VEGFR3-blocking antibodies in the DTH model,5
suggesting that Nrp2 and VEGFR3 are essential for proper
VEGFC/D signaling in lymphatic vessels. Together, these
data suggest that Nrp2 is necessary for proper lymphatic
architecture and adequate fluid drainage.
Our results demonstrate that NRP2 is the only VEGFR
that, when inhibited, increases edema (initial swelling after
acute inflammation resulting from blood vessel leakage),
and increases lymphedema (longer-term swelling after acute
inflammation resulting from the lack of proper drainage
from lymphatic vessels). In comparison, the inhibition of
VEGFR1/VEGFR2 or NRP1 improves edema, and the
inhibition of VEGFR3 worsens lymphedema but not
edema.3,5,27
In conclusion, our data suggest that NRP2 is important
for normal vascular function in adults. In this mouse
model,
Nrp2
deficiency
during
acute
inflammation
enhanced edema and lymphedema due to a loss of
endogenous Sema3F signaling. We speculate that down-
regulation of SEMA3F or its receptor may be involved in
skin disorders such as vascular or lymphatic malforma-
tions, dermatitis, and/or eczema. In fact, mutations in the
NRP2 gene have been found in patients with primary
lymphedema.19 Future studies on the role of the SEMA3F/
NRP2 axis in chronic inflammation or lymphedema are
encouraged.
