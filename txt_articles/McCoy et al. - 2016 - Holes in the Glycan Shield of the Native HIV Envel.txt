In Brief
This study describes monoclonal rabbit
antibodies elicited by the HIV immunogen
BG505 SOSIP.664. Previous reports
showed high-titer serum neutralization
against the BG505 virus, but the epitope
remained elusive. McCoy et al. show the
neutralizing epitope is a breach in HIV’s
glycan shield and suggest other HIV
strains contain similar holes.

SUMMARY
A major advance in the search for an HIV vaccine has
been the development of a near-native Envelope
trimer (BG505 SOSIP.664) that can induce robust
autologous Tier 2 neutralization. Here, potently
neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (nAbs) from rab-
bits immunized with BG505 SOSIP.664 are shown
to recognize an immunodominant region of gp120
centered on residue 241. Residue 241 occupies a
hole in the glycan defenses of the BG505 isolate,
with fewer than 3% of global isolates lacking a
glycan site at this position. However, at least one
conserved glycan site is missing in 89% of viruses,
suggesting the presence of glycan holes in most
HIV isolates. Serum evidence is consistent with tar-
geting of holes in natural infection. The immunogenic
nature of breaches in the glycan shield has been
under-appreciated in previous attempts to under-
stand autologous neutralizing antibody responses
and has important potential consequences for HIV
vaccine design.
INTRODUCTION
The development of a protective vaccine remains the most
attractive option for halting the global spread of HIV. Antibody-
based HIV vaccine research has focused on the HIV envelope
glycoprotein (Env), which is the only viral protein targeted by
neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) during natural infection. Extensive
progress has been made in identification and characterization of
nAbs from HIV-infected individuals that are both potently
neutralizing and active against an array of circulating HIV strains
(reviewed in Burton and Hangartner, 2016; Hraber et al., 2014;
Moore et al., 2015; West et al., 2014). Passive transfer of such
broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) into non-human pri-
mates (NHPs) protects against viral challenge even at low anti-
body concentrations (reviewed in van Gils and Sanders, 2014),
suggesting that such bnAbs, if induced by vaccination, will pre-
vent HIV infection. Many studies have investigated the coevolu-
tion of virus and nAbs. In HIV-infected patients who develop
bnAbs, the early potent autologous neutralizing response
broadens concomitantly with increased viral diversity as the
virus escapes from the autologous nAbs (Bhiman et al., 2015;
Garces et al., 2015; Liao et al., 2013; Moore et al., 2009; Wei
et al., 2003; Wibmer et al., 2013). Escape is frequently associated
with the addition of glycans (Bunnik et al., 2008; Moore et al.,
2009; Rong et al., 2009; van Gils et al., 2010).
In contrast to the plethora of bnAbs derived from HIV-positive
donors, and the multiple epitopes and mechanisms by which
they achieve breadth and potency, few immunization studies
have induced even moderately potent autologous neutralization
against typical resistant (Tier 2) primary viruses, never mind
against multiple heterologous viruses. Most Env subunit immuni-
zations have yielded non-nAbs or Abs that only neutralize highly
susceptible (Tier 1) viruses (Chen et al., 2013; Narayan et al.,
2013; Qin et al., 2014, 2015; Schiffner et al., 2013; Seaman
et al., 2010; Vaine et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2015). One system
in which strong autologous Tier 2 serum nAb responses have
been observed following Env immunization is that of rabbits
immunized with B41 and BG505 SOSIP.664 and SOSIP.v4 tri-
mers (de Taeye et al., 2015; Sanders et al., 2013, 2015). These

 soluble trimers closely mimic the native, membrane-embedded
functional trimer on the surface of virions and have the potential
to be key components of a nAb-eliciting vaccine (Burton and
Mascola, 2015; Hraber et al., 2014; Lee et al., 2016; Moore
et al., 2015; West et al., 2014). Despite these advances in the
presentation of native-like HIV trimers and the reproducible in-
duction of greater autologous neutralizing titers, little is under-
stood about the epitopes targeted. In part, this is because the
neutralization response to Env immunization in model systems
has most commonly been assessed by serology alone (Narayan
et al., 2013; Qin et al., 2014; Schiffner et al., 2013; Sundling et al.,
2010; Zhang et al., 2015). Attempts to map serum neutralization
following BG505 SOSIP.664 immunization have been limited to
those epitopes easily dissected with the use of CD4 binding
site mutants, peptides to linear epitopes, and alanine-scanning
panels (Sanders et al., 2015). Some monoclonal Abs (mAbs)
have been isolated from immunization studies with Env proteins
that are not good native trimeric mimics (Chen et al., 2013; Qin
et al., 2015), notably in NHPs (Phad et al., 2015; Sundling
et al., 2012, 2014). V5-specific mAbs that neutralize the autolo-
gous transmitter or founder virus were isolated from immunized
NHPs (Bradley et al., 2016). BnAbs have only been induced by
immunization as rare clones in camelids (McCoy et al., 2012,
2014) and in transgenic mice encoding mature bnAb heavy
chains in response to BG505 SOSIP.664 immunization (Dose-
novic et al., 2015).
In this study, we determined the specificities and molecu-
lar mechanisms underlying the potent autologous anti-HIV
response induced by BG505.664 SOSIP in rabbits by character-
izing mAbs from three rabbits 1 week after their final immuniza-
tion. Our findings reveal a neutralizing specificity that targets
holes in the glycan shield characteristic of a given isolate and
that conventional serological analysis has largely overlooked.
This work highlights the potential challenges posed by viral
glycans to any strategy to elicit bnAbs by first inducing auto-
logous nAbs, a pattern that has been hypothesized to occur in
natural HIV infection.
RESULTS
BG505-Specific mAbs Isolated from Three Immunized
Rabbits
Following immunization with BG505 SOSIP.664, three rabbits
were selected that exhibited strong serum-neutralizing activity
against the autologous BG505 virus (Sanders et al., 2015). The
rabbits were designated 1410, 1411, and 1412. The autologous
BG505 virus contains a T332N substitution to match the corre-
sponding SOSIP.664 protein at that position (Sanders et al.,
2015). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), which
were harvested 7 days after the final immunization (week 25),
and those that bound BG505 SOSIP.664 were isolated by sin-
gle-cell sorting as described in Experimental Procedures (Table
S1), enabling production of 39 mAbs from rabbits 1410–1412
(Figure 1A). The mAbs exhibited a range of ELISA binding activ-
ities against the BG505 SOSIP.664 immunogen, with half
maximal binding concentrations (EC50) ranging from 0.01 to
19.6 mg/ml (Figure 1A; Figure S1). Different levels of maximum
binding at the highest concentration assayed (25 mg/ml) ranged
from 5- to >20-fold above background, independent of the
EC50 value (Figure 1A).
The heavy-chain CDR3s (HCDR3s) of the mAbs have median
lengths of 14, 15, and 16 for rabbits 1410, 1411, and 1412, respec-
tively, which are similar to those previously reported for rabbits
(Lavinder et al., 2014), with individual HCDR3 sequences of up to
24 amino acids (Figure 1B). The median lengths and presence of
longer HCDR3s are similar to observations made on human Abs
(Lavinder et al., 2014). Sequence analysis of the mAb heavy chains
revealed multiple separate clonal lineages from each rabbit, as ex-
pected for a polyclonal response. However, a number of clonally
related sequences were also recognized. Each mAb was named
with the rabbit identifier (10, 11, or 12) and then a unique alphabet-
icallineageidentifier(A,B,etc.).Thisnamingwassufficient toiden-
tify the prototype Abs: 10A, 10B, 11A, 11B, etc. Additional lineage
members werethenassigneda further number:10A1, 11A1, 11A2,
etc. Of the multi-member lineages, all mAbs in the 10A, 11A, and
11Bfamiliesbound tobothBG505gp120and SOSIP.664proteins,
as did mAbs 10B and 10C.
Potent Autologous Neutralizing Activities of
Rabbit mAbs
The rabbit mAbs were evaluated for their ability to neutralize
BG505, the related maternal parent virus MG505.A2 (Wu et al.,
2006), and a small panel of heterologous viruses. The mAbs
belonging to the 10A, 11A, and 11B lineages potently neutralized
BG505 with 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values ranging
from 0.1 to 1.1 mg/ml, but they did not neutralize MG505.A2 (Fig-
ure 2A) or any heterologous viruses (Table S2). The mAbs 10B
and 10C were not able to neutralize the Tier 2 BG505 virus but
were able to neutralize heterologous Tier 1 viruses (Table S2)
and as such represent off-target responses (de Taeye et al.,
2015; Sanders et al., 2015).
The MG505.A2 virus differs in amino-acid sequence from
BG505 at 13 residues (Figure 2B). Thus, one or more of these
13 changes is crucial for loss of neutralization activity by nAbs
10A, 11A, and 11B. These three nAbs were able to neutralize a
point variant of MG505 that restored the BG505 serine at posi-
tion 241, denoted MG505 K241S, with IC50 values close to those
seen for BG505, thus identifying the 241 position as crucial for
nAb recognition (Figure 2C). Both BG505 and MG505 viral
sequences are atypical at the 241 position, which normally en-
codes a potential N-linked glycosylation site (PNGS) in 97% of
HIV strains (http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/index), and neutral-
ization of BG505 S241N was not observed (Figure 2C). The 241-
dependent nAbs comprise a major proportion of the BG505
serum-neutralizing activity of rabbits 1410 and 1411, because
the MG505 K241S virus is neutralized by the sera at titers almost
as high as the autologous virus BG505 (Figure 2D). Furthermore,
an additional seven of nine serum samples from BG505
SOSIP.664-immunized rabbits (Sanders et al., 2015) exhibited
the same phenotype (Figure S2). In a separate study, immuni-
zation with BG505 SOSIP.664 incorporated onto liposomes,
followed by soluble BG505 SOSIP.664 boosting, resulted in
the same 241-dependent activity in six of eight animals with
autologous neutralizing titers (Figure S2). Therefore, it appears
that sensitivity to position 241 is a major feature of autologous
nAbs induced in rabbits by BG505 SOSIP.664 immunization.

 Rabbit nAbs Target a Common Env Region Not
Previously Characterized
Given the preceding observations, we reasoned that it was likely
that the isolated mAbs recognize overlapping epitopes. Compet-
itive BG505 SOSIP.664 binding studies tested the ability of each
mAb to prevent binding of the biotinylated prototype lineage
members 10A, 11A, and 11B. As expected, within each lineage,
the members showed mutual inhibition of binding (Figure 2E). In
addition, the members of all three potently neutralizing lineages
competed to varying degrees with the biotinylated prototypes
of both other lineages as compared to a non-neutralizing mAb
10B. This suggests that all three sets of nAbs converge on a
common overlapping binding site (Figure 2E) despite having
arisen in two different animals and belonging to three distinct
clonal families.
As an alternate approach to investigate the region of Env
bound by the nAbs, we carried out negative-stain electron
microscopy (EM) analysis of BG505 SOSIP.664 trimers in com-
plex with rabbit mAb fragment antigen binding (Fab) of 10A,
11A, and 11B. The results indicate a common epitope for
nAbs 10A, 11A, and 11B situated on gp120 between the V4
loop and the glycan N88 (Figures 3A–3C; Figure S3). All three
Abs bind with a stoichiometry of three Fabs per trimer. The
three Fabs bind the trimers at an angle of approach from the
membrane-facing portion of the Env ectodomain (Figure 3D).
This angle is different from all characterized bnAbs isolated

 from human donors to date that either approach the trimer from
the apex or bind parallel to the membrane. The lack of con-
straints in the solubilized membrane-free immunogen likely
makes induction of nAbs with this approach angle possible.
However, the rabbit mAbs neutralize the BG505 pseudovirus,
in which Env is anchored to the membrane and therefore shows
that this constraint does not appear to strongly interfere with Ab
binding.
When the 3D EM reconstructions are compared to known
bnAb sites, they reveal a region of the Env surface not previously
described as being a recognition site for bnAbs (Figure 3E). Cen-
trally placed in this region is residue 241, which, as described

 earlier, is a serine in BG505 and not a PNGS, as commonly found
in other strains. The region thus constitutes a hole in the glycan
shield. Introduction of the S241N mutation into BG505.664
does not abolish binding of nAbs 10A or 11A to the trimer
when assayed by ELISA or biolayer interferometry (BLI; Fig-
ure 3F; Figure S4). However, the off rates for both nAbs are
dramatically increased in the presence of N241, illustrating that
the glycan alters the epitope in some manner. The increased
off rates result in an �10-fold decrease in measured binding af-
finities of the two Fabs to BG505 SOSIP.664 (Figure 3F). Rabbit
nAb 11B did not bind to the S241N mutant of BG505 SOSIP.664,
suggesting that its epitope is slightly different from those of 10A
and 11A. When viewed from the side, the three Abs bind at
different vertical levels of Env, with 11B binding slightly closer
to the apex, followed by 10A, and 11A binding closer to the mem-
brane (Figure 3D). This difference is corroborated by competition
assays with human gp120-gp41 interface mAbs (Figure 4A).
Earlier studies on a panel of BG505 alanine-scanning mutant vi-
ruses (Sanders et al., 2015) did not identify residue 241 as critical
for neutralization; S241A mutant and wild-type BG505 viruses
were equally neutralized by immune sera. However, this may
be due to the similarity of S and A. We re-examined the serum
alanine-scanning
data
from
rabbits
1410
and
1411
and
compared that data with similar alanine-scanning data for
mAbs 10A and 11A (Table S3). This showed that sera and
mAbs have a shared sensitivity to certain viral mutants, which
do not overlap with their epitopes, raising the possibility that
the effects of the substitutions are allosteric.
The non-Tier 2-nAbs, 10B and 10C, did not compete signifi-
cantly for the shared site bound by the nAbs (Table S5). Epitope
mapping using a D368R mutant BG505 gp120 and a V3 peptide-
fragment crystallizable (Fc) fusion construct indicated that 10B
binds to V3 and 10C binds to the CD4 binding site of gp120; in
addition, one non-nAb from rabbit 1410 bound to post-fusion
MN gp41-soluble protein (data not shown). A proportion of
non-nAbs was found to compete with human bnAbs 8ANC195,
35022, 3BC315, and 3BC176, which bind the gp120-gp41 inter-
face (Table S4). This is similar to the results described in

mice. Immunoglobulin (Ig) G was purified from non-neutralizing
mouse serum and found to compete most strongly with
3BC315 alone (62%) or in combination with 35022 (74%).
A Second Weak Autologous nAb Specificity Is Identified
that Is Glycan Sensitive
The third rabbit from which mAbs were isolated, rabbit 1412, also
yielded a neutralizing lineage, designated 12A and comprising
three members, all of which bind BG505 SOSIP.664 but not
gp120 (Figures 1A and 4B). The activity of the 12A prototype
was identified in the original neutralization screen (Table S2).
However, its neutralization potency was weak, with IC50 values
approaching 100 mg/ml and lower affinity for SOSIP trimers rela-
tive to 10A, 11A, and 11B (Figures 3F and 4B). Because 12A
required gp41 or a trimer configuration for binding, it was tested

pseudoviruses
previously generated to characterize the
human bnAb PGT151 (Blattner et al.,
2014; Falkowska et al., 2014). Of these,
an N611A BG505 variant was more
sensitive
(�100-fold)
to
12A
family
neutralization than the wild-type BG505
virus (Figure 4C). However, nAb 12A did
not show any major increase in breadth
in terms of neutralization (Figure 4C),
regardless of the absence of N611.
In
contrast
to
the
241-dependent
response described earlier, the N611-
dependent response is unlikely to be a
major component of the neutralization activity of the donor rabbit
(1412), because the serum neutralized wild-type and N611A
variant BG505 isolates similarly (Figure 4D). However, competi-
tion studies indicate that the N611-dependent response over-
laps, in terms of Env footprint, to a degree with the 10A, 11A,
and 11B nAbs and many isolated non-nAbs (Figure 4A; Table
S5). Still, EM analysis illustrates that the binding site of rabbit
nAb 12A is different from that of 10A, 11A, and 11B, and the anti-
body exhibits a steeper angle of approach to Env, a feature that
is more common for human bnAbs. In fact, 12A binds an epitope
closer to PGT151 and does not always bind with a stoichiometry
of three Fabs per trimer (Figures 4E and 4F). Overall, another nAb
response has been identified to target an epitope in the vicinity of
that targeted by the 241-centered Abs, and that potent neutral-
ization is again dependent on the absence of glycosylation at a
key position.

 The Incidence of Missing Glycan Sites in HIV Env Trimer
Generally
The 241 glycan site is conserved in 97% of HIV-1 isolates. The
wild-type BG505 virus lacks not only this site but also the
conserved glycan sites at 289 and 332, which are 72% and
67% conserved, respectively, in other isolates (Figure S5). How-
ever, the BG505 immunogen and viruses used in this study were
engineered to contain N332 (Sanders et al., 2015). The 289
glycan site is close to the 241 site, and an absence of a glycan
at this position could contribute to a larger glycan hole. To
assess this, we generated a 289 glycan site knockin virus and
a 230 glycan site knockin virus; this second glycan is absent in
BG505 but not conserved in >50% of strains. The reintroduction
of either glycan was able to ablate the neutralization activity of all
three nAbs. However, because neither glycan is present in
MG505, neither prevents neutralization of the resistant MG505
pseudovirus, which is rendered sensitive to neutralization by
the substitution of lysine for serine at position 241 (Figure 2C).
BG505 is not unusual in lacking highly conserved glycan sites.
Analysis of 3,792 unique sequences (http://www.lanl.gov/)
shows that 96% of strains are missing one or more conserved
(defined as R50% incidence) glycan sites (Table 1). This does
not necessarily mean that 96% of isolates have a glycan hole.
Nearby glycan sites might provide a compensatory glycan that
could, in effect, substitute for the missing glycan (Sok et al.,
2013). Considering the N332 and N334 glycan sites (which are
mutually exclusive), approximately 33% of isolates lack the
conserved N332 glycan site, but of this subset, 27% of isolates
have the N334 site. Thus, 94% of isolates have a glycan site at
either N332 or N334, and the presence of a glycan hole in this re-
gion may be as low as 6%. Different approaches are possible for
estimating the probability of nearby glycans compensating for a
given glycan and leading to reduced likelihood of a glycan hole.
Using one approach based on potential glycan sites within four
residues of a missing glycan compensating for that glycan, the
preceding figure of 96% is reduced to 89% of strains (Table 1).
However, this number is based on one approach to calculation
of potential glycan substitution, and further detailed experi-
mental studies are warranted to explore the phenomenon of
glycan substitution and its potential role in glycan holes. Alterna-
tively, if missing glycan sites in a given isolate are spatially close,
they may create a larger hole, as is suggested by the ablation of
neutralization activity by the introduction of a glycan at 289 or
230 in the case of BG505. The individual glycan sites that are
absent in viruses that lack multiple conserved glycan sites vary
between isolates. In some cases, they are close and may
contribute to a larger glycan hole, such as that seen in BG505,
while others are well separated and are predicted to have multi-
ple discrete glycan holes. Across 3,792 unique Env sequences,
no individual pair of glycan sites was found to be missing more
often than would be predicted by their individual conservation
level (Figure S5). Of the 3,407 unique strains that lack two or
more conserved glycan sites, 33 strains are missing glycan sites
at 241 and 289 (including BG505), but almost one-third (1,030
strains) are missing glycan site 289. Across these 1,030 strains,
the other most commonly missing glycan sites are 234, 295, 339,
355, and 625 (Figure S5). Of these, 295, 339, and 355 are within
22 A
˚ of the 289 glycan site in Env (Figure 5B), so their combined
absence with 289 could produce a larger glycan hole similar to
that found in BG505 in approximately 20% of strains, when
considering just this one 72% conserved glycan site as the focal
point. Thus, the formation of a larger hole in the glycan shield in
strains lacking multiple conserved glycan sites is not unlikely.
However, how many missing glycan sites are needed to provide
an immunodominant target for neutralizing activity remains to be
determined experimentally from further immunization studies.
DISCUSSION
This study has identified a highly immunogenic neutralizing site
on the HIV Env BG505 SOSIP.664 trimer, centered on residue
241 of gp120, that is recognized by three separate potent nAb
lineages (10A, 11A, and 11B) derived from two immunized rab-
bits. Viral mutagenesis and mapping studies show that the
potent autologous serum-neutralizing activity in the two donor
animals can be largely assigned to the 241-dependent speci-
ficity. In addition, serum studies on a larger number of animals
shows the prevalence of this neutralizing specificity in 67%–

Different definitions of conserved (R50%, R70%, R85%, or R90%) are listed in the first column. Glycan sites in variable loops were not included in
this analysis due to difficulties in aligning the variable loops of Env, given the high levels of diversity in both loop length and sequence. The percentage
of strains lacking at least one conserved glycan site is shown in the second column according to alignment to the HXB2 PNGS. The third column shows
the same figure if allowance is made for nearby glycan sites that could in principle substitute for a given glycan (see Experimental Procedures).

 75% of rabbits that were capable of neutralizing BG505
(including animals in separate immunization studies). Therefore,
immunization of rabbits with BG505 SOSIP.664 produces a re-
producible immunodominant autologous Tier 2 neutralizing
response directed to a common epitope region. Another nAb
lineage was identified in a third rabbit that recognized a different
but overlapping epitope at the gp120-gp41 interface.
Tier 2 autologous nAb responses have been described previ-
ously through immunization with DNA prime-Env boost regimes
(Crooks et al., 2015; Narayan et al., 2013), with a DNA/virus-like
particle (VLP)-Env regime (Crooks et al., 2015), and with Env
gp140 (Bradley et al., 2016). Such responses, although encour-
aging, were sporadic, occurring in few animals. The latter identi-
fied an autologous nAb lineage from one of six NHPs immunized
with transmitter or founder Env. The nAbs bind a V5 epitope that
can be blocked by the introduction of a glycan at position 463
(<50% conserved), which was observed in the donor virus
6 months after transmission. In the DNA/VLP-Env study, sera
from a small number of rabbits immunized with VLP-associated
JR-FL Env potently neutralized the JR-FL isolate. This isolate

(A) Rabbit mAbs were titrated against the pseudovirus mutants indicated in the top row in the TZM-bl luciferase reporter assay, and the IC50 values were
calculated using Prism. No neutralization activity is indicated by an IC50 > 25. The mAbs are no longer able to neutralize viruses in which either the N230 or the
N289 glycan site is restored.
(B) Model of a fully glycosylated BG505 SOSIP.664 trimer constructed using PDB: 5ACO with glycans 184, 465, 332, 289, and 241 (which are absent from the PDB
file) modeled onto the structure. The glycan site found at 230 in <50% of strains, not including BG505, is indicated by asterisk, and an arrow points to the space
that would be occupied by the 230 glycan, because residue 230 lies behind the 448 glycan between 241, 295, and 289. Glycan sites depicted on all three
protomers of the trimer are color coded by their level of conservation across 3,792 unique Env sequences aligned to the HXB2 PNGS (glycan site residue numbers
are shown on only one protomer).
(C) Percentage of strains lacking at least one conserved glycan according to different definitions of ‘‘conserved’’ (R50%, R70%, R85%, or R90%). For each
definition, two percentage values are given: (a) is the lower estimate for strains lacking at least one conserved glycan, calculated by counting conserved glycan
sites aligned to the HXB2 PNGS for each strain and counting nearby glycan sites that could in principle provide a compensating glycan as explained in the text.
(b) is the upper estimate for strains lacking at least one conserved glycan, calculated by only counting conserved glycan sites aligned to the HXB2 PNGS for each
strain (see Table 1 for additional information).
(D) The number of HIV strains lacking between zero and seven PNGSs at Env positions, where a PNGS is conserved at the R50% glycan site cutoff level.

 lacks a glycan site at position 197, which is an unusual feature
compared to other isolates (Crooks et al., 2015). Furthermore,
resistant viruses derived from several Tier 2 isolates, when engi-
neered to eliminate the glycan site at N197, were neutralized by
the sera. The data were interpreted to suggest a hole at position
197 in the glycan shield that was being targeted by the immune
sera. In these studies, neutralization was only observed in a frac-
tion of immunized animals, in contrast to the study described
herein. In another study, Tier 1 nAbs induced during infection
of NHP with a virus lacking the N160 glycan site were shown
to bind a V2/V3 epitope that is occluded by the re-introduction
of the N160 glycan (Krachmarov et al., 2011). Thus, the principle
of targeting a hole in the glycan shield following Env immuniza-
tion is clearly supported. The extent to which glycan holes
contribute to antibody response to BG505 SOSIP.664 and addi-
tional Env trimers derived from other HIV strains are under inves-
tigation in multiple species. The absence of this highly conserved
glycan was not predicted to be a target of autologous serum
neutralization. However, in structural studies, the 241 glycan
was missing in BG505, necessitating the modeling of this glycan
into a high-resolution structure of a glycosylated Env trimer to
more fully represent circulating strains (Pancera et al., 2014).
A number of studies suggest that holes in the glycan shield can
play an important role in nAb responses in humans. First, many
studies of natural infection have described autologous neutral-
izing responses from which viruses escape by addition of a
glycan site that may correspond to the filling of holes (Bunnik
et al., 2008; Moore et al., 2009; Rong et al., 2009; van Gils
et al., 2010; Wei et al., 2003). As a single example, Wei et al.
(2003) showed that viruses from one donor (WEAU) lacked the
highly conserved glycan at position 234 until day 212, when
escape from the autologous plasma was observed. Removal of
the glycan site from the day 212 escape virus resulted in a
20-fold increase in contemporaneous plasma neutralization
(Wei et al., 2003). Second, study of inferred precursors of the
PGT121 family of bnAbs suggests that the early response is
directed to an Env lacking certain glycan sites (Sok et al.,
2014) and later matures to the more fully glycosylated Env (Gar-
ces et al., 2015). Third, the lack of a glycan at position 276 is sug-
gested as important for the initiation of VRC01-class antibody
lineages targeting the CD4 binding site, and designed Env immu-
nogens lacking the glycan N276 are efficient in binding and acti-
vation of VRC01-class precursors (Jardine et al., 2013, 2015;
Lynch et al., 2015). Fourth, two donors infected with viruses lack-
ing the N332 glycan site developed autologous nAbs that were
postulated to target the 332 region (Moore et al., 2012). Subse-
quently, escape viruses from the same donors acquired the
N332 site and developed bnAb lineages targeting the N332
glycan, although whether the bnAb and autologous nAb lineages
are related is not known (Moore et al., 2012). Whether autologous
nAbs can be the precursors of bnAb lineages is unclear. Data
from natural infection suggest that autologous nAbs may pres-
sure the patient virus to expose immunotypes that trigger the
induction of bnAbs (Moody et al., 2015; Moore et al., 2015).
How does antibody targeting of breaches in the glycan de-
fenses of Env affect HIV vaccine development that seeks to elicit
bnAbs? We have shown that most Tier 2 isolates lack at least one
conserved glycan site, with the absence of two conserved sites
being the most common occurrence. For the existing Tier 2 Env
immunogen BG505 SOSIP.664, one approach to increase the
breadth of the response is to fill in the isolate-specific glycan
holes in the hope that this will re-direct the Ab response to
more cross-reactive epitopes that have already been defined
by known bnAbs (Burton and Hangartner, 2016; Burton and
Mascola, 2015; West et al., 2014). This strategy would effectively
mimic the post-autologous nAb viral escape stage of natural
infection in which autologous nAbs have selected for viruses
with fewer immunogenic glycan holes, potentially resulting in
greater bnAb epitope exposure. To this end, it would be invalu-
able to establish whether any bnAb precursors are present
even at low to very low levels in the responses to BG505
SOSIP.664 immunization. A second approach is to design im-
munogens to broaden the Tier 2 isolate-specific responses
described. For example, one might seek to introduce a glycan,
perhaps of a shorter oligosaccharide chain, at position 241 as a
boosting antigen. In this context, both 10A and 11A bind to
BG505 S241N SOSIP.664 protein, albeit at a lower level than
wild-type. Thus, the results suggest that these potent nAbs can
accommodate, to some degree, a glycan at position 241, unlike
11B. For BG505-derived immunogens, both approaches could
be facilitated by higher-resolution structures of complexes of
additional immunization-induced nAbs and trimers. Furthermore,
our findings provide a rationale for the design of immunogens
based on other HIV strains in termsof examining which conserved
glycan sites are absent and filling these potential holes.
In summary, we have uncovered a paradigm of vulnerability on
Env immunogens; glycan holes in Tier 2 stabilized Env trimers
are immunogenic and can be a dominant target of autologous
neutralization. The role of a glycan hole in autologous rabbit serum
BG505 neutralization described in this study agrees with the
established role of glycan-mediated escape from autologous
neutralization during natural infection. Therefore, it is critical to
consider the glycan holes present in individual HIV isolates when
designing immunogens and evaluating post-immunization nAbs.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting
Cryopreserved PBMCs were thawed, resuspended in 10 ml of RPMI 10% fetal
calf serum (FCS), and collected by centrifugation at 6003 g for 5 min. Cells were
washed with PBS, resuspended in 10 ml of PBS, and collected by a second
centrifugation step. Cells were resuspended in 100 ml of FACS wash buffer
(FWB) (2% FCS PBS) with anti-rabbit IgM fluorescein isothiocyanate (1:1,000)
and a streptavidin-allophycocyanin cell tetramer of biotinylated anti-rabbit
IgG. After 1 hr on ice, cells were washed once with 10 ml of PBS, collected by
centrifugation, and resuspended in 100 ml of FWB with 1 ml of a streptavidin-
phycoerythrin(PE) tetramerofbiotinylatedBG505SOSIP.664and1mlofa mixed
streptavidin-BV786 tetramer of B41 and ZM197 SOSIP.664. After a further 1 hr
on ice, cells were washed once with 10 ml of PBS, collected by centrifugation,
and resuspended in 500 ml of FWB for sorting on a Becton Dickinson (BD) fluo-
rescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) Aria III. IgM-IgG+BG505+B41+ZM197+
lymphocytes were collected at 1 cell per well into Superscript III Reverse Tran-
scriptase lysis buffer (Invitrogen) as previously described and immediately
stored at �80�C before cDNA generation and single-cell PCR (Table S1).

 expressed with the FreeStyle 293 Expression System (Invitrogen). Abs were
purified using affinity chromatography (Protein A Sepharose Fast Flow, GE
Healthcare), and the purity and integrity were checked by SDS-PAGE. To
generate Fabs, rabbit IgG was digested with 2% papain (Sigma P3125) in
digestion buffer (10 mM L-cysteine, 100 mM Na acetate [pH 5.6], 0.3 mM
EDTA) for 6 hr and then quenched with 30 mM iodoacetamide. Undigested
IgG and Fc fragments were removed by affinity chromatography, and the
Fab-containing flowthrough was collected. Size-exclusion chromatography
was performed using Superdex 200 10/300 resin (GE Healthcare) to remove
papain and digestion byproducts.
Controls
For all neutralization, ELISA, and flow cytometry assays, where indicated, the
(+) positive control was the anti-V3 mAb R56 (PDB: 4JO1) and the (�) negative
control was a hybrid using the heavy chain of R56 and light chain of R20 that
cannot bind HIV Env (PDB: 4JO3).
Neutralization Assays
Pseudovirus neutralization assays using TZM-bl target cells were carried out
as previously described (Li et al., 2005).
ELISAs
ELISAs were performed as described (Sanders et al., 2015 and Derking et al.,
2015).
Statistical Methods
Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 6 for Windows.
Site-Directed Mutagenesis
Env and mAb mutants were generated using the QuikChange site-directed
mutagenesis kit (Agilent) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
BLI
His-tagged BG505 SOSIP.664 trimers were loaded onto nickel-nitrilotriacetic
acid (Ni-NTA) biosensors and dipped into varying concentrations of rabbit
Fab (1,000, 500, 250, 125, 62.5, 32.25, and 16 nM) using an Octet Red96 in-
strument (ForteBio). All samples were previously diluted in 13 kinetics buffer
(PBS [pH 7.2], 0.01% [w/v] BSA, 0.002% [v/v] Tween 20). Association was
measured for 300 s, followed by dissociation for 1,200 s in 13 kinetics buffer.
Anti-HIV Fabs b6 and PGT151 were used as negative and positive controls,
respectively, to ensure trimer integrity. A reference well containing 13 kinetics
buffer was subtracted from each dataset, curves were aligned on the y axis
using the baseline step, and an interstep correction was applied between
the association and the dissociation curves. A 1:1 binding model, which as-
sumes first-order kinetics and that Fabs bind to all available sites on the trimer
at an equal rate, was fit to the data (Figure S4).
Negative-Stain EM
BG505 SOSIP.664 was incubated with a six-molar excess of rabbit Fabs 10A,
11A, 11B, or 12A overnight at room temperature. Grid preparation, data collec-
tion, and data processing followed the same protocol described elsewhere
(de Taeye et al., 2015) using Leginon and Appion software suites (Lander
et al., 2009; Suloway et al., 2005); see Figure S3 for additional information.
EM reconstructions have been deposited to the Electron Microscopy Data
Bank (EMD-8309–12).
Immunizations
The immunization of animals 1254, 1256, 1257, 1274, 1278, 1279, 1283–1285,
and 1410–1412 was previously described (Sanders et al., 2015). In addition,
three groups of New Zealand white rabbits (3409–3420) were immunized twice
with either sham liposomes or liposomes embedded with post-fusion gp41 or
BG505 SOSIP.664. Proteins were conjugated to pegylated distearoylphose-
thanolamine (PEG-DSPE) using maleimide chemistry (Figure S2). All animals
then received three soluble BG505 SOSIP.664 protein boosts as detailed in
Figure S2. The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI) Institutional Animal Care
and Use Office and the Committee (IACUC) approved all experimental proce-
dures involving rabbits 3409–3420.
Bioinformatics Analysis
The analysis of glycan site conservation was based on sequence datasets
from the Los Alamos national Laboratory (LANL; http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/
content/index). First, 3,792 unique sequences were selected according to
the PatientCode field. The PNGS sequon N-X-S/T, in which X is any amino
acid except proline, was used to search the alignment and tabulate the num-
ber of PNGSs at each position. In addition, the number of PNGSs at each
position was calculated to allow for nearby glycan substitution by discount-
ing those strains in which a glycan site is found up to four residues away from
each conserved (R50%) HXB2 PNGS. Large sequence alignments contain-
ing both closely and distantly related sequences of varying length can
contain local regions with gaps and may result in variation of assigned posi-
tions among different alignment algorithms. Regions with many gaps, such
as the variable loops, were excluded from this analysis, and only regions
with no or minimal gaps were included to minimize PNGS counting errors.
For the glycan modeling, GlycanRelax (Pancera et al., 2010) was employed
to generate conformations of Man8 at all predicted N-linked glycosylation
motifs in PDB: 4TVP and at positions 184, 241, 289, 332, and 465, which
are naturally missing in BG505. A single representative model was chosen
for each figure.
