Abstract
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading causes of death worldwide and represent a substantial economic burden on
public health care systems. Epigenetic markers have potential as diagnostic markers before clinical symptoms have emerged,
and as prognostic markers to inform the choice of clinical intervention. In this study, we performed an epigenome-wide asso-
ciation study (EWAS) for CVDs, to identify disease-specific alterations in DNA methylation. CpG methylation in blood samples
from the northern Sweden population health study (NSPHS) (n ¼ 729) was assayed on the Illumina Infinium
HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. Individuals with a history of a CVD were identified in the cohort. It included individuals
with hypertension (N ¼ 147), myocardial infarction (MI) (N ¼ 48), stroke (N ¼ 27), thrombosis (N ¼ 22) and cardiac arrhythmia
(N ¼ 5). Differential DNA methylation was observed at 211 CpG-sites in individuals with a history of MI (q <0.05). These sites
represent 196 genes, of which 42 have been described in the scientific literature to be related to cardiac function, cardiovascu-
lar disease, cardiogenesis and recovery after ischemic injury. We have shown that individuals with a history of MI have a
deviating pattern of DNA methylation at many genomic loci of which a large fraction has previously been linked to CVD. Our
results highlight genes that might be important in the pathogenesis of MI or in recovery. In addition, the sites pointed out in
this study can serve as candidates for further evaluation as potential biomarkers for MI.
Introduction
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is among the leading causes of
death worldwide and the number of deaths is predicted to in-
crease even further (1,2). CVD is an umbrella term for several
conditions affecting the heart, blood and vasculature of the body
e.g. stroke, hypertension, thrombosis, myocardial infarction (MI),
and cardiac arrhythmia. There are numerous known risk factors
for developing CVDs, such as age, high blood pressure, tobacco
smoking and obesity (2). Genome wide association studies have
also identified more than fifty genomic loci associated with
coronary artery disease (3–5). Despite known risk factors and the
identification of genetic risk factors, much of the causality that
underlies CVD remains undetermined. Data on epigenetic alter-
ations, which represent genomic responses to environmental
factors, also have the potential to provide insights into the gene-
sis and progression of complex diseases such as CVDs (6).
Previous studies have reported increased global levels of
DNA methylation in patients diagnosed with CVDs (2) as well as
in patients with confirmed coronary artery disease (CAD) (7).

 A candidate gene-oriented studies have also reported associa-
tions between gene-specific methylation and atherosclerosis,
CAD, hypertension, heart failure and stroke (8). One epigenome-
wide association study (EWAS) for CAD has previously been per-
formed utilizing the HCGI12K array, which contains probes for
12,192 CpG islands (9). Even though the sample size was limited
(18 cases and 18 controls), as many as 72 differentially methyl-
ated regions (DMRs) were reported to be associated with CAD (9).
During the last years, genome-wide assays for high resolution
mapping of DNA methylation at CpG sites has become available.
In this study, we present the results from an EWAS for CVDs per-
formed on blood samples from a cross-sectional study cohort;
the Northern Sweden Population Health Study cohort (NSPHS).
CpG methylation was assayed by utilizing the Ilumina Infinium
HumanMethylation450 BeadChip, which interrogates approxi-
mately 485,000 individual sites across the genome.
Results
Clinical characteristics of the study cohort are presented in
Table 1 and Table 2. After quality control of the DNA methyla-
tion, 729 participants (Table 1a) and 470,789 autosomal CpG
sites remained for EWAS analyses. The NSPHS is a cross-
sectional study and participants were not ascertained due to
disease status. However, a total of 238 participants had experi-
enced one or more CVDs or related risk factors, such as hyper-
tension or type two diabetes (Table 2). Hypertension was
reported
by
147
participants;
diabetes
by
51;
myocardial
infarction by 48, stroke by 27, thrombosis by 22 and cardiac ar-
rhythmia by five.
EWAS revealed that a history of MI was associated with al-
tered methylation at 211 individual CpG sites (Fig. 1).
These
sites mapped to 196 individual genes (Supplementary Material,
Table S1). Some degree of inflation in low P-values could be ob-
served
(k ¼ 1.44 6 2.6E-5)
(Supplementary
Material,
Fig.
1),
which is probably due to global alterations in CpG methylation
following MI and consistent with previous reports on global
hypermethylation in patients with a history of MI (2). A review
of the published literature revealed biological function related
to cardiovascular disease, cardiogenesis and recovery after is-
chemic injury for 42 of the MI-associated probe-linked genes
(Table 3). For example, altered methylation at CpG-sites related
to a number of cardioprotective genes, with known functions
in recovery after an ischemic event, was observed, i.e. DYSF,
SFRP4, NRG1, BNIP3 and GDF15 (Table 3). All significant associa-
tions were reanalysed with BMI excluded from the model to
evaluate if BMI might influence the association between the
disease phenotypes and DNA methylation. The re-analysis re-
sulted in very similar P-values indicating that BMI did not in-
fluence the association between disease phenotypes and DNA
methylation.
Enrichment analyses were performed on the results from
the MI EWAS. A total of 19,746 gene names were entered into
GOrilla (10) of which 19,351 were recognized. Twenty-four du-
plicated genes were removed, which left a total of 19,327 genes
for the enrichment analyses. Of these, 16,826 genes were asso-
ciated with GO terms. GOrilla identified 519 enriched biological

richment for terms clustering under parent terms related to lo-
comotory
behavior,
central

system
neuron
differentiation, calcium ion transport and regulation of syn-
apse organization (Supplementary Material, Table S2). For the
Enrichr-analysis (12), we utilized the list of 211 MI-associated
CpG-sites. Sites where the methylation levels were signifi-
cantly associated with a disease phenotype, and for which no
gene annotation were available, were assigned to the nearest
protein-coding transcript by examining sites manually using
the UCSC genome browser (13). Comparison against the path-
way databases KEGG (14,15) and Wikipathways (16) revealed
enrichment of genes within the ERBB- and BDNF-signalling
pathways, as well as genes related to neural crest differentia-
tion. Comparison against the curated biological pathway data-
base Reactome (17,18) revealed enrichment of genes related
to neuronal systems and a number of categories relating to
transmembrane
ion
transport
and
synaptic
signalling
(Supplementary Materials, Tables S3–S5).
Despite the large number of participants in NSPHS with hy-
pertension, no associations of CpG methylation with hyperten-
sion were observed. Neither could any association be detected
between CpG methylation and stroke, or thrombosis. Cardiac ar-
rhythmia was excluded due to the low number of cases (N ¼ 5).
Analysis of genomic function
A total of six of our MI-associated CpG-sites overlapped with
previously
identified
CVD
genome-wide
association
study
(GWAS) loci (5,19) (Table 4). We performed additional analyses
to test for association between leading SNPs at CVD-loci with
methylation at proximal MI-associated CpG-sites as well as
with MI. We were unable to detect associations between CVD-
associated SNPs with MI or with methylation at proximal MI-
associated CpG-sites (<0.05 for all tests). However, available
data from chromatin-chromatin interaction studies reveal pos-
sible long-range interactions between MI-associated CpG-sites
with previously reported CVD loci (Table 4). For example, long
range chromatin-chromatin interaction data from the genome
institute of Singapore (GIS) (20) were indicative of a series of
long-range interactions between putative regulatory elements
upstream of JAG1, which spans a hypertension-associated
GWAS locus (19), with the JAG1 promoter (Fig. 2) where one of
our MI sites (cg00051068) is located. This points towards a possi-
ble link between our CpG site and the previously identified hy-
pertension locus, despite their distance of about 320kb. Another
potential overlap is between cg05896042 (chr19:11,450,089),
which is located within the promoter region of RAB3D, and
rs1122608, which is an intronic SNP within SMARCA4. Rs1122608
is located about 40kb upstream from LDLR, which has been as-
sociated with early-onset myocardial infarction (21) and aortic

Discussion
In this study, we aimed to identify alterations in CpG methyla-
tion associated with common CVDs present in a population co-
hort from northern Sweden. We were able to find differential
DNA methylation at 211 individual CpG sites, corresponding to
196 different genes, in participants with a history of MI.
A substantial number (N ¼ 42) of the 211 MI associated CpG
sites were mapped to genes with described biological functions
that are highly relevant for cardiovascular function, myocardial
development as well as response to responses ischemic injury.
These include RYR2 that encodes the ryanodine receptor 2,
which regulates calcium influx from the sarcoplasmic reticu-
lum, and KCNN1 that encodes the small conductance Ca2þ-acti-
vated K-channel 1 (SK1). Other of our MI-associated genes are
involved in cardiogenesis including nicotinamide mononucleo-
tide
adenylyltransferase
2
(NMNAT2),
formin-like
protein
2 (FMNL2), homeobox protein Meis1 (MEIS1), protein Wnt-7a
(WNT7A), heart and neural crest derivatives-expressed protein
2 (HAND2), T-box transcription factor TBX18 (TBX18), leiomodin-
2 (LMOD2), transcription factor SOX17 (SOX17), fibroblast growth
factor 1 (FGF1) and putative transcription factor Ovo-like 1
(OVol02521) or have cardioprotective functions following ische-
mic events or reperfusion injury such as: ephrin type-A receptor
2 (EPHA2), dysferlin (DYSF), secreted frizzled-related protein 4
(SFRP4), pro-neuregulin-1 (NRG1), BCL2/adenovirus E1B 19 kDa
protein-interacting protein 3 (BNIP3), growth/differentiation fac-
tor 15 (GDF15) and membrane protein MLC1 (MLC1).
Two of the MI-associated CpG sites identified in our study
were located within known genetic hypertension-associated
loci identified in previous GWAS (5,19): cg10953508, which is lo-
cated within the promoter region of MECOM; and cg18496965,
which is located within the promoter region of G6B within the
BAT2-BAT3 locus. In addition, six MI-associated CpG-sites were
located in the vicinity of GWAS-identified CVD-associated loci
that have previously been associated with CVDs (Table 4). Long-
range chromatin-chromatin interaction data were supportive of
long-range chromatin interactions between the region of the
CpG site and the previously known CVD loci (Table 4). E.g., the
hypertension-associated JAG1 locus, which is located in a prob-
able regulatory region within an upstream gene desert: ChIA-
PET data are supportive of chromatin–chromatin interactions
between putative regulatory elements within the JAG1 up-
stream region with the JAG1 promoter, which contains one of
the MI-associated CpG-sites identified in our analysis (Fig. 2).
Even though many of the CpG sites map to cardiac-related
genes, it is worth considering that variation at regulatory sites
do not necessarily affect the most nearby gene. The study of ge-
nomic interaction utilizing chromatin configuration capture has
shown that interactions between genomic elements can occur
over a relatively large distance, even up to several million base-
pairs (23,24).
Even though we adjusted for many potential technical and
biological confounders in our analyses (e.g. batch effects, cell
composition, age and sex) we still have a high inflation in our
test statistics. This inflation is in agreement with previous stud-
ies of differential DNA methylation (25). In comparison to
GWAS where the identified genetic variants are causal of the as-
sociated phenotypic variation, the differentially methylated
CpG sites identified in an EWAS are less likely to be causal.
Instead, MI alterations in DNA methylation can reflect underly-
ing environmental/lifestyle factors (e.g. smoking or diet) that
are risk factors for MI, or alterations that occur in association
with the disease progression or the recovery after an episode of
MI. It is well known that a MI causes a dramatic response in our
body through the release of several signalling molecules and
the activation of these can be reflected by alterations in DNA
methylation. It is therefore important to consider that the infla-
tion in low P-values in an EWAS is expected, and is not compa-
rable to the low inflation commonly seen in GWA studies.
A limitation of our study is the relatively small sample size of
the NSPHS cohort, and the limited number of participants that
have experienced CVD. According to our power calculation, we
expect to have an 80% chance to detect a difference in DNA
methylation level of 3.0, 1.5, 1.3, 0.95, and 0.63 standard units for
N¼ 5, 20, 30, 50, 150 cases, respectively. The MI-associated signals
had an average difference between cases and controls of 0.70
standard units which is just below the 80% detection limit for 47
cases. It is therefore not surprising that the diseases with lower
number of cases did not result in any significant findings due to
the low sample size. Despite the limited cohort size, we were
able to observe 211 altered CpG sites associated with a history of
MI, which may reflect homogenous and specific biologic re-
sponses that occur after a myocardial ischemic injury. However,
we could also observe a high degree of co-morbidity of different
CVDs in participants from the NSPHS cohort (Table 2), which
may bias our results leading to detection of DNA methylation
patterns that represent a combination of co-morbidities, or indi-
vidual co-morbidities themselves. Another limitation of this
study is that we did not have an independent cohort for replica-
tion of our results, which would have improved the confidence
of our results.
In this study, blood is utilized as a surrogate tissue for the
study of more pathologically relevant tissues involved in cardio-
vascular disease, such as biopsies of the myocardium or of
blood vessel walls. One of the challenges in epigenetic studies is
how to utilize data on DNA methylation from accessible tissues,
such as peripheral blood cells, in the prediction of pathological
mechanisms in hard-to-reach tissues that are more relevant for
the studied pathology. One previous study on peripheral blood
leukocytes (PBL) and atrial biopsies collected from patients un-
dergoing coronary bypass surgery was able to report a high cor-
relation of DNA methylation between these tissues (R2¼0.83)
(26), which supports the utility of DNA methylation in periph-
eral blood cells in predicting the function in cardiac cells. By uti-
lizing machine learning based on paired DNA methylation
datasets, Ma and colleagues were also able to predict the DNA
methylation pattern in atrial biopsies from PBL DNA methyla-
tion data with very high precision (R2¼0.98–0.99)(26). The study
by Ma et al. study shows that statistical utilities to accurately

surrogates are highly feasible. Development is however depen-
dent on the collection of paired data sets to compare between
tissues. For a more clinically relevant use as a biomarker, our re-
sults show that MI-associated alterations in DNA methylation
take place in peripheral blood cells and can be studied for the
development of biomarkers for diagnosis or disease prognosis.
In addition, we also used information from when participants
were interviewed for their history of CVD rather than having ac-
cess to medical records is a limitation of our study. This also re-

 DNA methylation. However, it is worth considering that these
limitations are mainly decreasing the power of our study, and
there is no reason to believe that they would increase the risk of
false positive findings.
Alterations in DNA methylation occur in concert with gene
regulatory programs associated with specific biological re-
sponses. However, DNA methylation patterns are also deter-
mined by genetic variants. The interplay between genetic
variation and the environment, and how DNA methylation fac-
tors into the emergence of a clinical phenotype are still un-
known. DNA methylation is related to chromatin accessibility
and the occupancy of transcription factor binding at gene regu-
latory sites and promoters. As such, the observed alterations in
DNA methylation associated with myocardial infarction may
reflect gene regulatory mechanisms that form part of the re-
sponse to an ischemic event.
In summary, we have identified 211 CpG sites that are differ-
entially methylated in blood samples from participants that have
experienced an episode of MI. As many as 42 of the MI-associated
probe-linked genes have previously been associated with CVDs
or cardiac function, development and recovery after an ischemic
event, which further points to the biological relevance of the ob-
served changes in DNA methylation in blood samples. Even
though we cannot pinpoint the role of these changes in the path-
ogenesis of MI, or in the recovery after an episode of MI, the list
would be of great value for further investigation, particularly for
identifying CpG-sites that can serve as diagnostic biomarkers or
as prognostic biomarkers to identify at-risk patient groups.
Materials and Methods
Northern Sweden population health study
The NSPHS comprises data from a cross sectional cohort that
was gathered during 2006 and 2009 from the population in the
parishes of Karesuando and Soppero, Norrbotten County. All in-
habitants aged 15 or above were invited to participate, which re-
sulted in 1,068 participants. All participants provided written
informed consent to the examination of genetic and environ-
mental causes of disease. Peripheral blood samples were col-
lected from all participants and immediately stored at �70�C.
Data on disease history, medication and other physical traits
were collected from all participants by interviews. The NSPHS
study was approved by the local ethics committee at Uppsala
University (Regionala Etikpro
¨vningsn€
amnden, Uppsala, permit
number
2005:325)
in
compliance
with
the
Declaration
of
Helsinki.
DNA methylation
Genomic DNA was extracted from blood samples of 743 partici-
pants and subjected to bisulfite-conversion using the EZ-DNA
methylation kit (ZYMO research). DNA methylation was as-
sayed on the HumanMethylation450K Beadchip (Illumina, San
Diego, USA). Raw data were analysed using the minfi package in
R. Normalization was performed using Subset-quantile Within
Array
Normalization
(SWAN).
A
marker
detection
p-val-
ue � 1.38e-10 was used to adjust for the number of individuals
and the number of analysed CpG sites. The probe call rate
was > 0.98 and the individual call rate was > 0.98. Control sam-
ples and duplicated samples were removed as described previ-
ously (27). In addition, ethnic outliers and participant with
missing phenotypic data were also removed. White blood cell
(WBC) fractions were inferred from methylation data (28) as de-
scribed previously (27).
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed in R version 3.1.2. A rank-
based inverse normal transformation was performed to adjust
for non-normally distributed methylation data (29) using the
‘rntransform’ function included in the GenABEL package (30).
Because the NSPHS is a population-based study that includes re-
lated individuals, all methylation values needed to be adjusted
for relatedness among individuals. Methylation values were ad-
justed for relatedness, sex, age, estimated cell fractions, as well
as array and slide information using the polygenetic function in
the GenABEL package, which also adjusts for population stratifi-
cation if present, using a genetic kinship matrix. The kinship
matrix was estimated using the ‘ibs’ function in GenABEL includ-
ing genotyped autosomal SNPs (MAF > 0.05) from the cohort.
Information about the SNP data has been published previously
(31). The residuals from the polygenic models were exported for
regression analyses in relation to CVDs. Linear regression analy-
sis was performed using the generalized linear models-function,
‘glm’, in the stats package with adjusted methylation levels (re-
siduals from the polygeneic model) as the response variable
with the disease phenotype, age, sex, BMI and whether the indi-
vidual was a smoker or not as explanatory variables. Individuals
with a history of a specific disease were set as cases in the re-
spective analysis and individuals with no prior history of cardio-
vascular disease or diabetes were set as controls. P-values were
adjusted using the false discovery rate (FDR) and a q-value< 0.05
was considered significant. Sensitivity analyses were performed
for all significant sites in order to evaluate if BMI might influence
the association between the disease phenotypes and DNA meth-
ylation. These analyses were performed as before but BMI was
excluded in the regression analyses.
Enrichment analysis
Enrichment analyses were performed with the web-based gene
ontology enrichment analysis and visualization tool Gorilla (10).
We also used enrichment analyses to identify overrepresented
biological pathways, using Enrichr (12) (accession date: Nov.
2015), for the MI-associated CpG sites. Enrichr is a one-stop on-
line tool for enrichment analyses against a collection of gene-
set libraries. We used REVIGO for summarizing and reducing
lists of GO terms to make them more comprehensible. REVIGO
relies on clustering by measures of semantic similarity to iden-
tify representative GO categories (11).
All genomic coordinates reported are in GRCh37 (hg19). For
enrichment analyses, we used the annotation of DNA methyla-
tion sites provided by Illumina (HumanMethylation450_150
17482_v.1.1.csv, accessed: September 1, 2012), to assign CpG-
sites to a corresponding gene. When multiple CpG sites were
mapped to the same gene, only the CpG site with the lowest
P-value was kept, leaving one CpG site and one P-value per gene
for the respective disease phenotype. Genes were ranked with
regards to these P-values and the enrichment analyses in
GOrilla were performed using the ranked list of genes.
Analysis of potential chromatin-chromatin interactions
MI associated CpG-sites that overlapped (within 1Mb) with pre-
viously reported CVD-associated loci were examined for poten-
tial functional interaction via open access datasets on chromatin-

 chromatin interactions. In situ Hi-C data generated by the Aiden
lab have demonstrated that the genome partitions into topologi-
cally associated domains (TADs) in which interactions take place
(23). We examined TADs of all significant CpG sites that were lo-
cated within 1 MB of previously known CVD loci via the stand-
alone software Juicebox (http://www.aidenlab.org/juicebox/, acces-
sion date 2015/11/01). Chromatin interaction analysis by paired-
end tag sequencing (ChIA-PET) allows analysis of genomic loci
that bind a specific locus and has been performed for a number of
transcription factors by the genome institute of Singapore (20).
ChIA-PET data for DNA polymerase 2 was accessed to examine
chromatin-chromatin interactions related to transcription, such
as promoter-enhancer interactions. These data were accessed (ac-
cession date 2015/11/01) and visualized via the WashU epigenome
browser at http://epigenomegateway.wustl.edu/.
Additional analyses were performed to test for associations
between leading SNPs at CVD-loci with methylation at proximal
MI-associated CpG-sites as well as with MI. Linear regression
analyses were utilized as described in the statistical analysis
section. In tests for association between SNPs and CpG-
methylation, adjusted methylation levels (residuals from the
polygeneic model) were set as the response variable with geno-
type, age, sex, BMI and whether the individual was a smoker or
not as explanatory variables. In tests for association of SNPs
with MI, the disease was set as the response variable with geno-
type, age, sex, BMI and smoking as explanatory variables.
Power calculation
To evaluate the power to detect differentially methylated regions
depending on the number of cases we performed power calcula-
tions. In agreement with the DNA methylation values being rank
transformed, we assume that DNA methylation levels in cases
and controls are approximately normally distributed (SD¼ 1),
with a difference in the mean value. Using the stats library in R,
the power can then be calculated by: Power ¼ pchisq(threshold,
df ¼ 1, lower.tail ¼ FALSE, ncp¼ N * H2). Where the power de-
pends on what fraction of variation in DNA methylation levels
that can be explained by the difference between cases and con-
trols. The threshold ¼ qchisq (alpha, df ¼ 1, lower.tail ¼ FALSE) is
the chi2 threshold for alpha ¼ 0.05/470789 (Bonferroni adjust-
ment for multiple testing) and N is the sample size, which is the
number of cases (491) plus the number of controls in each analy-
sis. H2 reflects the fraction in variance explained by the differ-
ence in DNA methylation levels between cases and controls and
is determined by the difference in mean methylation level be-
tween the groups and the number of cases versus controls.
Using the sample size of 491 controls and a threshold of signifi-
cance of alpha ¼ 0.05/470789, this gives that, to reach an 80%
power to detect a difference between cases and controls, mini-
mum H2 ranges from 0.077 to 0.055 when the number of cases
increases from 5 to 200 (total samples size increase from 496 to
691). This is equal to a minimum difference in mean DNA meth-
ylation level of 3.0, 1.5, 1.3, 0.95, and 0.63 standard deviations for
N¼ 5, 20, 30, 50, 150, respectively. Considering that the average
standard deviation for the CpG sites in our data was 0.0316, this
equals a difference in DNA methylation levels between cases
and controls of approximately 0.093, 0.047, 0.040, 0.030, and 0.020
for the different number of cases respectively.
