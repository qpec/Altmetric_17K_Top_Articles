Abstract
Heat-not-burn tobacco products, battery powered devices that heat leaf tobacco to approxi-
mately 500 degrees Fahrenheit to produce an inhalable aerosol, are being introduced in mar-
kets around the world. Japan, where manufacturers have marketed several heat-not-burn
brands since 2014, has been the focal national test market, with the intention of developing
global marketing strategies. We used Google search query data to estimate, for the first time,
the scale and growth potential of heat-not-burn tobacco products. Average monthly searches
for heat-not-burn products rose 1,426% (95%CI: 746,3574) between their first (2015) and sec-
ond (2016) complete years on the market and an additional 100% (95%CI: 60, 173) between
the products second (2016) and third years on the market (Jan-Sep 2017). There are now
between 5.9 and 7.5 million heat-not-burn related Google searches in Japan each month based
on September 2017 estimates. Moreover, forecasts relying on the historical trends suggest
heat-not-burn searches will increase an additional 32% (95%CI: -4 to 79) during 2018, com-
pared to current estimates for 2017 (Jan-Sep), with continued growth thereafter expected. Con-
trasting heat-not-burn’s rise in Japan to electronic cigarettes’ rise in the United States we find
searches for heat-not-burn eclipsed electronic cigarette searches during April 2016. Moreover,
the change in average monthly queries for heat-not-burn in Japan between 2015 and 2017 was
399 (95% CI: 184, 1490) times larger than the change in average monthly queries for electronic
cigarettes in the Unites States over the same time period, increasing by 2,956% (95% CI: 1729,
7304) compared to only 7% (95% CI: 3,13). Our findings are a clarion call for tobacco control
leaders to ready themselves as heat-not-burn tobacco products will likely garner substantial
interest as they are introduced into new markets. Public health practitioners should expand
heat-not-burn tobacco product surveillance, adjust existing tobacco control strategies to account
for heat-not-burn tobacco products, and preemptively study the health risks/benefits, popular
perceptions, and health messaging around heat-not-burn tobacco products.

 Introduction
The tobacco control community is still deciding how to address the unexpected rise in popu-
larity of electronic cigarettes [1–2]. However, there is another product innovation already
emerging: Heat-not-burn tobacco products.
Battery powered devices that heat leaf tobacco to approximately 500 degrees Fahrenheit to
produce an inhalable aerosol, heat-not-burn tobacco products are being introduced in markets
around the world by tobacco companies seeking to appeal to trendy or potentially health-con-
scious consumers who still demand the “throat-hit” delivered by combustible cigarettes but
not by electronic cigarettes [3]. Japan has been the focal market to test the potential of heat-
not-burn as a cigarette alternative, where manufacturers have marketed several heat-not-burn
brands nationwide, including Japan Tobacco’s “Ploom TECH” device in March 2016, Philip
Morris International’s “iQOS” (or “ICOS”) device in April 2016, and British American Tobac-
co’s “Glo” device in December 2016 [4]. Tobacco industry leaders have predicted heat-not-
burn products are poised to further displace traditional cigarette smoking and, by extension,
tobacco control strategies typically framed around cigarettes. Yet, little is known about the
popularity of these products. For the first time, we describe trends in the popularity of heat-
not-burn tobacco products in their Japanese test market and compare these trends with histor-
ical trends for electronic cigarettes to understand the growth potential of this new product
globally.
Materials and methods
Traditional survey-based assessments are not available to describe the heat-not-burn tobacco
market because survey data are delayed or simply fail to ask about heat-not-burn tobacco.
However, examining how individuals search online takes surveillance to the next level by
revealing both the searcher’s thoughts, through the types of queries undertaken, and their
actions toward product use, through engaging in the search behavior itself, without any instru-
mental priming [5,6]. Search query trends were used to first describe the emergence of elec-
tronic cigarettes by Ayers and colleagues in 2011 [1] when the tobacco control community was
focused on a snus pandemic that never materialized. Moreover, search query trends consis-
tently foreshadow consumer behaviors outside tobacco, including public adoption of novel
products [7].
Monthly Google query trends were monitored from January 1, 2010 through September 13,
2017 (google.com/trends). All queries including “heat-not-burn” and/or the most popular
brands [8] originating from Japan, as well as their Japanese translations were monitored in
aggregate representing heat-not-burn popularity. Specifically, we used www.tobaccowatcher.
org to search news archives for stories on heat-not-burn tobacco products to identify the com-
mon Japanese nomenclature around these products, discovering 加熱式たばこ and 加熱式
タバコ were the most common references to generic heat-not-burn tobacco products. We
also identified all brands currently discussed in the media using the same strategy, including
“iqos”/”icos” [アイコス], “plume” [プルーム], and “glo” [グロー].
Given heat-not-burn tobacco products are not marketed nationally outside of Japan we
compared Japanese heat-not-burn search trends against searches for electronic cigarettes in
the United States. This analysis was intended to compare the growth rate and growth potential
of heat-not-burn against the past growth of electronic cigarettes using a common metric:
Internet search. Moreover, because nicotine containing electronic cigarettes are not (legally)
sold in Japan we could not validly compare Japanese heat-not-burn searches against electronic
cigarettes within Japan. All queries including the terms “electronic cigarette(s),” “ecig(s),” “e-
cig(s),” “e cig(s),” “e cigarette(s),” “e-cigarette(s),” “vape(s),” “vaper(s),” or “vaping” were

 monitored in aggregate alongside the names of the most popular e-cigarette brands “blu,”
“eleaf,” “eversmoke,” “greensmoke,” “green smoke,” “halo cigs,” “halo ecigs,” “njoy,” “v2,”
“vuse,” “el ray,” “vapestick,” “21st century smoke,” “vaporx,” “markten,” “v2pro,” or “vapor
couture” representing electronic cigarettes popularity building on past work [2,9]. Because all
searches are typically increasing, a normalized, monthly ratio of focal queries to all queries was
analyzed (relative search volume [RSV]), alongside raw volume estimates computed by multi-
plying the query fraction and the estimated number of total searches from comScore.
We evaluated changes in average monthly heat-not-burn queries in Japan and electronic
cigarette queries in the United States using relative differences of means with confidence inter-
vals calculated via bootstrap resampling. To make predictions through 2018 we used Hynd-
man and Khandakar’s autoregressive integrated moving average algorithm that uses historical
data to predict future values [10]. Ninety-five percent prediction intervals were generated from
1000 simulations of the ARIMA model with resampling errors from the fitted model (rather
than normal errors). Predictions for 2018 were compared to the monthly average queries in
2017. All analyses were performed using R ver 3.4.3.
Results
Heat-not-burn searches originating in Japan have experienced tremendous growth (Fig 1).
Since the introduction of Philip Morris International’s iQOS brand in select Japanese cities in
November 2014, searches for heat-not-burn products have increased substantially. Average
monthly searches rose 1,426% (95%CI: 746–3,574) between the first (2015) and second (2016)
complete years heat-not-burn tobacco was marketed. Queries for heat-not-burn products con-
tinued to grow an additional 100% (95%CI: 60–173) between the products second (2016) and
third years on the market (Jan-Sep 2017). In practical terms, there are now between 5.9 and 7.5

 million heat-not-burn related Google searches in Japan each month based on the latest search
estimates for September 2017. Moreover, forecasts relying on the historical trend suggest heat-
not-burn searches will increase an additional 32% (95%CI: -4 to 79) during 2018, compared to
current estimates for 2017 (Jan-Sep), with further growth expected.
Queries for heat-not-burn in Japan occur more frequently than queries for electronic ciga-
rettes in the United States, with the Japanese heat-not-burn queries first eclipsing electronic
cigarette queries in April 2016. Further, the change in average monthly queries for heat-not-
burn in Japan between 2015 and 2017 was 399 (95% CI: 184–1,490) times larger than the
change in average monthly queries for electronic cigarettes in the Unites States over the same
time period, increasing by 2,956% (95%CI: 1,729–7,304) compared to only 7% (95%CI: 3–13).
These results indicate that interest in heat-not-burn may outpace interest in electronic ciga-
rettes (in areas where they are introduced) not just now but for years to come.
Discussion
Millions are seeking out heat-not-burn tobacco products in Japan each month, with growth
rates and projections for future growth eclipsing the past rise of electronic cigarettes. These
findings suggest the heat-not-burn market is poised for explosive global growth.
Given these products’ success in Japan, it is unsurprising that the heat-not-burn market is
expanding. Heat-not-burn tobacco products have recently been released in metropolitan test
markets in more than twenty nations, including the United Kingdom, Russia, and Korea [11].
Moreover, Philip Morris International’s iQOS recently entered the Food and Drug Adminis-
tration approval process to begin sales in the United States [12]. Our findings suggest that
tobacco control leaders should prepare for substantial demand for these products when they
are introduced to new markets and/or expanded in existing markets. Traditional surveillance
strategies to monitor these markets must be developed and put in place now [13], including
further analyses of other big media data [14]. In particular, while our study identified a grow-
ing aggregate trend, use of specific products or types of products must be monitored, along
with variations in heat-not-burn tobacco product receptivity across demographic groups.
Demand for heat-not-burn tobacco products presents a host of tobacco control challenges
similar to electronic cigarettes and new challenges specific to these products [15]. Heat-not-
burn tobacco products have been advertised as reduced-risk tobacco products in their Japa-
nese test market [16], and these marketing messages will undoubtedly contaminate other mar-
kets even where such messaging is banned. Tobacco control advocates will have to develop
strategies to both discover and then disseminate messages about the health risks associated
with these products. Further, tobacco control advocates will have to consider making adjust-
ments to existing tobacco control policies so that they apply to heat-not-burn tobacco prod-
ucts. For example, policy makers want to extend existing indoor smoking bans to include the
emissions from heat-not-burn tobacco products, whether to stigmatize their use or protect
bystanders from potentially hazardous emissions [17].
The Japanese test market may not effectively translate to other markets for two principal
reasons. First, novel, tech-related product adoption is potentially more common in Asian soci-
eties; however, a perpetually weak Japanese economy may be reducing this potential bias
where cost is a significant barrier regardless of the public’s inclination [4]. Second, nicotine-
infused liquid, such as those used in electronic cigarettes, are strictly regulated as pharmaceuti-
cal products, while pipe tobacco used in heat-not-burn tobacco products are not [18]. There-
fore, the Japanese heat-not-burn market may be advantaged by being the only non-
combustible novel alternative to cigarette smoking. Last, some may question the use of search
query trends, however, these data presaged the global rise of electronic cigarettes [1–2], have

 produced actionable insights across tobacco control that presage traditional data or fill data
gaps [19–22], and search query trends for tobacco have been validated against survey based cri-
terion [23].
Our findings are a clarion call to action. As of July 18, 2017 there are fewer than 26 studies
to date including “heat not burn” or “heat-not-burn” in the title or Abstract on PubMed [24–
28]. Only 1 study aimed to describe use of the product in Japan and that study was before heat-
not-burn tobacco was launched nationwide [8]. Other studies are mostly laboratory-based
product descriptions or speculative opinion pieces. Health agencies, policy-makers and health
practitioners should fill this gap and preempt rising popularity of these products by investing
in tobacco control research and strategies for heat-not-burn tobacco products now.
