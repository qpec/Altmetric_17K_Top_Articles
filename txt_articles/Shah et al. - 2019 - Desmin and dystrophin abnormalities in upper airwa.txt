Abstract
Background: The pathophysiology of obstruction and swallowing dysfunction in snores and sleep apnea patients
remains unclear. Neuropathy and to some extent myopathy have been suggested as contributing causes. Recently
we reported an absence and an abnormal isoform of two cytoskeletal proteins, desmin, and dystrophin, in upper
airway muscles of healthy humans. These cytoskeletal proteins are considered vital for muscle function. We aimed
to investigate for muscle cytoskeletal abnormalities in upper airways and its association with swallowing
dysfunction and severity of sleep apnea.
Methods: Cytoskeletal proteins desmin and dystrophin were morphologically evaluated in the uvula muscle of 22
patients undergoing soft palate surgery due to snoring and sleep apnea and in 10 healthy controls. The muscles
were analysed with immunohistochemical methods, and swallowing function was assessed using videoradiography.
Results: Desmin displayed a disorganized pattern in 21 ± 13% of the muscle fibres in patients, while these fibers were
not present in controls. Muscle fibres lacking desmin were present in both patients and controls, but the proportion
was higher in patients (25 ± 12% vs. 14 ± 7%, p = 0.009). The overall desmin abnormalities were significantly more
frequent in patients than in controls (46 ± 18% vs. 14 ± 7%, p < 0.001). In patients, the C-terminus of the dystrophin
molecule was absent in 19 ± 18% of the desmin-abnormal muscle fibres. Patients with swallowing dysfunction had 55
± 10% desmin-abnormal muscle fibres vs. 22 ± 6% in patients without swallowing dysfunction, p = 0.002.
Conclusion: Cytoskeletal abnormalities in soft palate muscles most likely contribute to pharyngeal dysfunction in
snorers and sleep apnea patients. Plausible causes for the presence of these abnormalities is traumatic snoring
vibrations, tissue stretch or muscle overload.

Background
Obstructive sleep apnea is a highly prevalent disorder asso-
ciated with adverse health consequences [1]. The disorder
is characterized by repetitive narrowing and collapse of the
upper airways, with snoring and subsequent hypoxia [2].
Inadequate dilating muscle forces are suggested as an im-
portant factor in the pathophysiology of obstructive sleep
apnea. Nerve injuries due to traumatic snoring vibration
have been proposed as one of the causes for the inability
of the upper airway muscles to maintain patency during
sleep and for the commonly occurring swallowing dysfunc-
tion in snorers and sleep apnea patients [3–14]. Although
evidence of upper airway neuropathy exists in snorer and
sleep apnea patients, acquired muscle injuries as a contrib-
uting cause for muscle weakness and pharyngeal dysfunc-
tion has gained less attention [11].
We have earlier reported that a small subpopulation of
fibres in soft palate muscles of healthy humans lacked or
had a truncated form of two cytoskeletal proteins, des-
min, and dystrophin [15]. This is specifically interesting
since these two cytoskeletal filaments are considered to
be ubiquitous and vital for muscle function [16]. Desmin

 is the major intermediate filament (IF) in mature mus-
cles [16]. It is located at the periphery of the Z-disc and
links the entire contractile apparatus to the subsarco-
lemmal cytoskeleton, the cell nuclei and to other organ-
elles such as mitochondria [17–19]. The network of
desmin filaments supports the structural and mechanical
integrity of the muscle cell during contraction and con-
tributes to force transmission and load bearing [16].
Dystrophin is localized in the inner part of the sarco-
lemma where it binds other cytoskeletal protein fila-
ments in the muscle cell to the surrounding extracellular
matrix (ECM) through the cell membrane [20]. The
C-terminus domain of the dystrophin molecule is associ-
ated with the membrane-spanning dystrophin-associated
protein complex (DAPC), whereas its N-terminus inter-
acts with actin filaments. The DAPC has significant roles
in stabilizing sarcolemma and transmitting force gener-
ated in the muscle sarcomere to ECM [21]. In genetic
myopathies and animal gene knockout experiments, the
absence of these proteins leads to progressive muscle
weakness [22, 23].
Presence of abnormalities in cytoskeletal proteins in
upper-airway muscles of snoring and sleep apnea pa-
tients and its impact on pharyngeal function has not
been investigated. Therefore, we aimed to investigate for
desmin and dystrophin abnormalities in soft palate mus-
cles of snoring and sleep apnea patients and to evaluate
whether these abnormalities relate to deviations in swal-
lowing function and severity of obstructive sleep apnea.
Methods
Patients and controls
Twenty-two consecutive patients (1 female, 21 males)
referred for upper-airway surgery because of snoring and
sleep apnea were included. The exclusion criteria were
smoking, previous palatal surgery, systemic disease,
medications, and drug abuse. The mean age was 45 years
(range 29–60), and the mean body mass index (BMI)
was 28 kg/m2 (range 21–34). Ten voluntary controls, all
males, mean age 38 years (range 30–51) and mean BMI
24 kg/m2 (range 22–30), were recruited through adver-
tisements. The exclusion criteria were similar as in pa-
tients, but also included habitual snoring and sleep
apnea. For reference, a biopsy from an arm muscle, bi-
ceps brachii, and a thigh muscle, vastus lateralis, were
acquired from two healthy adult male subjects.
Sleep apnea recordings
All patients and voluntary controls underwent ambula-
tory overnight sleep apnea recordings (Embletta, Embla
systems, Kanata, Canada) using nasal cannula pressure,
thoracic and abdominal respiratory effort, finger oxim-
etry
(Nonin
Oximeter,
Plymouth)
and
a
body-positioning sensor. All the recordings were scored
manually according to the American Academy of Sleep
Medicine recommendations. The definition of an apnea
was a ≥ 90% cessation of airflow lasting at least 10 s,
while a hypopnea was defined as 50% reduction in air-
flow compared with baseline, in combination with an
oxygen desaturation of ≥3% [24].
Swallowing examination
Swallowing function was investigated in all patients and
voluntary controls using a videoradiographic examin-
ation (C-arm, Philips BV 29, field width 23 cm) in an up-
right position and with lateral and frontal projections.
The subjects first swallowed a chewed solid bolus of
crisp bread and barium sulphate (Mixobar Esophagus;
Astra) and then a liquid barium sulphate contrast bolus
(Mixobar High Density; Astra). All standard boluses
were repeated twice in each projection. The examina-
tions were evaluated at full speed and slow motion by
two investigators blinded for the clinical findings of the
subjects. Swallowing function was graded as 1. normal
function, 2. mild dysfunction in the presence of one of
the following deviant features; premature leakage, velar
dysfunction, residual or laryngeal penetration, 3. moder-
ate dysfunction with two or more deviant features in
grade 2 or dysfunction of the upper esophageal sphinc-
ter, the epiglottis or the propagation wave and, 4. severe
dysfunction with aspiration below the vocal cords [25].
Tissue samples and immunohistochemistry
In patients, the entire base of the uvula was resected in
connection with soft-palate surgery. In 3 of the cases,
parts of the palatopharyngeus muscle were also available.
The samples from voluntary controls were acquired
from the corresponding site by using punch biopsy tech-
nique, except in one case where complete surgical resec-
tion of the uvula was performed. Since a punch biopsy
represents only a part of the muscle cross-section, aut-
opsies were acquired from the entire base of uvula from
5 subjects who died accidentally (2 males and 3 females),
mean age 54 years (range 46–75), mean BMI 25 kg/m2
(range 21–31). The autopsies were used only as a
cross-reference to determine that the punch biopsies
were representative for the entire muscle cross-section.
The exclusion criteria were similar to those of voluntary
controls. No medical history of snoring and sleep apnea
were reported, and all subjects had a normal craniofacial
and oro-pharyngeal anatomy. All samples were taken
within 12–24 h post-mortem, a delay that not affects
muscle morphology, muscle proteome and fibre typing
[26, 27].
The muscle samples were cut into small pieces and ori-
ented for both cross- and longitudinal sectioning. Some
samples were immediately mounted in OCT (optimum
cutting temperature) compound (Tissue Tek,
Miles,
Shah et al. Respiratory Research           (2019) 20:31

 Elkhart, IN, USA) and frozen in liquid propane chilled
with liquid nitrogen, while others were fixed before freez-
ing using 4% formaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH
7.0, for 24 h at 4 °C and overnight washing at 4 °C in Tyr-
odes solution containing 10% sucrose. Five μm thick serial
muscle sections were cut in a cryostat and mounted on
glass slides. The sections were immunostained with previ-
ously characterized monoclonal (mAb) and polyclonal
(pAb) antibodies directed against IF desmin, alpha-actinin
(a major component of the Z-disk), membrane-associated
proteins dystrophin, utrophin, and laminin, and isoforms
of contractile myosin heavy chain (MyHC) motor proteins
were used (Table 1). A mounting medium with DAPI (4′,
6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride) was used to
visualize nuclei (H-1500, Vector Lab, Burlingame, CA,
USA). Details of the used multi-staining technique have
been described previously [28].
Muscle fibre type classification
Based on the immunostaining pattern for the different
MyHC mAbs, the muscle fibres were classified as slow
contracting MyHC-I (type I) or fast contracting MyHC-II
(type II) fibres.
Quantitative and statistical analysis
Muscle cross-sections from uvula of all the patients and
controls were included in the quantification. Palatophar-
yngeus muscles were not included in the quantitative ana-
lysis, due to the small sample size and lack of control
biopsies. In uvula, 4 to 5 random areas from each muscle
cross-section were scanned at 20x magnification with a
fluorescence microscope (Leica DM6000B, Leica Micro-
systems CMS GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany) equipped with a
digital high-speed fluorescence charge-coupled device
(CCD) camera (Leica DFC360 FX). The number of un-
stained, weakly stained, or disorderly stained fibres for the
Abs directed against desmin and dystrophin were quanti-
fied manually on each photo (Photoshop CS5, version
12.0.4, San Jose, CA, USA). The investigators were blinded
to the origin of the samples. Comparisons between the
mean values of changes in muscle fibres between the two
groups were made using the Mann-Whitney U test. For
comparing more than two groups, planned one-way
ANOVA (analysis of variance) with bootstrapping was
used. Both statistical tests do not require an assumption
of normality in the distribution of data. Values are pre-
sented as the mean ± standard deviation. Results were
considered significant at a p-value of ≤0.05. All the tests
were performed with SPSS (statistical package for social
sciences) software (IBM SPSS 23, statistical software,
Armok, NY: IBM corp., USA).
Results
All 22 patients snored, and 14 had obstructive sleep
apnea (mean AHI 24, range 5–84). Ten patients had a
moderate swallowing dysfunction, 6 patients had a mild
dysfunction and 6 had a normal function. None of the
10 voluntary controls snored or had sleep apnea and
they all displayed a normal swallowing function.
Muscle morphology
The muscle morphology of patients differed distinctly
from that of the controls, by having considerably larger
variability in muscle fibre size and fibre form, more
loosely packed fibres, and a greater amount of connect-
ive and fat tissue (Fig. 1).

 Immunoreactivity for cytoskeletal and membrane proteins
Two major abnormal immunostaining patterns for desmin
were observed in both small and large sized fibers in uvula
and palatopharyngeus muscle cross-sections of patients.
One of the patterns, observed both in controls and pa-
tients, displayed lack of immunoreactivity for desmin, here
referred to as desmin-negative fibres (Figs. 1, 2, 3). The
other immunoreaction pattern, exclusively present in
muscle fibres of patients, displayed a disorganization of
desmin ranging from fibres expressing small to large ag-
gregates to fibres with an extensive derangement of des-
min in a lobulated or trabecular pattern (Fig. 3). These
fibres are referred to as desmin-disorganized fibres. A
weak to intense subsarcolemmal staining for desmin was
often
present
in
both
desmin-negative
and
desmin-disorganized fibres (Figs. 2 and 3).
In longitudinal muscle sections of patients, some of the
muscle fibres showed disruptions in the normal striations
of desmin in the Z-band region of the sarcomere, while
others displayed complete disorganization or absence of
desmin (Fig. 3 e-h). The disorganization or absence of des-
min was in some fibres only located in specific regions
along the length of the myofibril. Aggregates of desmin
spanning over several Z-disks were often observed within
the myofibrils (Fig. 3 e-h). In controls, all muscle fibres ex-
pressing desmin exhibited a normal distribution of desmin
along the Z-disk, seen as horizontal striations of labeling
(Fig. 3a). The immunoreaction patterns observed in both
patients and controls were confirmed with all Abs di-
rected against desmin (Table 1).
In control sections where desmin was co-labeled with
alpha-actinin, a unique marker for the Z-disc, an intact
sarcomeric structure were observed in all muscles, irre-
spectively of absence or presence of immunoreaction for
desmin. In patients, the immunoreaction for alpha-
actinin in desmin negative fibres was generally weak,
while all desmin disorganized fibres showed deranged
immunolabeling for alpha-actinin ranging from weak to
strong (Fig. 4). Muscle fibres in patients expressing a
normal staining pattern for desmin also showed a nor-
mal staining pattern for alpha-actinin at the Z-disk.
The immunostaining for the different subunits of the dys-
trophin molecule revealed that a subgroup of muscle fibres,
especially in patients, was unstained or weakly stained for
the dystrophin C-terminus (-COOH), while the rod and the
N-terminus (-NH2) domain of the dystrophin molecule
showed normal immunoreactivity in the sarcolemma (Figs.
1 and 2). All muscle fibres lacking immunoreaction for dys-
trophin C-terminus also displayed abnormal immunoreac-
tion for desmin (Figs. 1 and 2). The cell membrane of all
muscle fibres was normally stained for laminin in both
patients and controls (Fig. 1). Utrophin, a paralog to dys-
trophin, was not upregulated in any muscle fibres.
All reference samples from limb muscles showed nor-
mal immunoreaction pattern for all antibodies directed
against cytoskeletal and membrane proteins.
Quantification of cytoskeletal abnormalities
The quantification and statistical analyses of fibres with
abnormal expression of desmin and dystrophin in the
uvula muscle were based on an evaluation of 7836
muscle fibres in patients and 1443 muscle fibres in the
biopsies from voluntary controls.
For cross-reference, the biopsies from voluntary con-
trols and patients were compared with the results from
control autopsies (n = 3453 muscle fibres).
Proportion of desmin and dystrophin abnormalities
All samples from patients had cytoskeletal abnormalities
in the muscle fibre population. The proportion of
desmin-disorganized fibres was 21 ± 13% in patients,
while they were not present in controls (Fig. 3 i). No
specific fibre type predilection was observed for fibres
with disorganized desmin. Desmin-negative fibres were

 found in 25 ± 12% of the fibre population in patients,
which was significantly more than in controls (14 ± 7%, p
= 0.009) (Fig. 2 g). These fibres were predominantly of
slow type I (64 ± 22%) (Fig. 5). The pooled fractions of
desmin-negative and desmin-disorganized fibres (46 ±
18%), referred to as desmin-abnormal fibres, were signifi-
cantly higher in patients than in controls (p < 0.001) (Fig.
3 j). The frequency of dystrophin C-terminus-negative fi-
bres was also significantly higher in patients (19 ± 18%)
compared to controls (7 ± 2%, p = 0.04) (Fig. 2 h).
Cross-reference with control autopsies
No significant differences in muscle morphology and
proportions of desmin-negative fibres were observed
between control autopsies and control biopsies. Desmin
disorganized fibres were not observed either in control
biopsies or autopsies. The proportion of cytoskeletal ab-
normalities in patient biopsies was significantly higher
compared to control autopsies (data not shown).
Proportion of desmin and dystrophin abnormalities in
patients with and without a swallowing dysfunction
Both desmin-negative and desmin-disorganized muscle
fibres were significantly higher in patients with swallow-
ing dysfunction compared with patients with normal
function (p = 0.005) (Fig. 6 a and b).
The pooled fractions of desmin-negative and desmin-
disorganized fibres i.e. desmin-abnormal fibres, were 55

dysfunction compared to 22 ± 6% in patients with a nor-
mal swallowing function, (p = 0.002) (Fig. 6 c).
The frequency of dystrophin C-terminus-negative fibres
was higher in patients with a swallowing dysfunction than
in patients with a normal function (18 ± 13% vs. 7 ± 5%, p

Comparison between cytoskeletal abnormalities and AHI
All snoring and sleep apnea patients had a significantly
higher proportion of cytoskeletal abnormalities com-
pared to controls, but the degree of abnormalities did
not show any significant relationship with the severity of
AHI or oxygen desaturation.
Discussion
We here report evidence of cytoskeletal abnormalities in
soft palate muscles of snoring and sleep apnea patients. A
significant number of muscle fibres revealed an absence,
derangement or an abnormal isoform of two important
cytoskeletal proteins, desmin, and dystrophin. Interest-
ingly, these cytoskeletal abnormalities were significantly
more frequent in snoring and sleep apnea patients with
swallowing dysfunction than in patients with normal swal-
lowing function. The present findings highlight that apart
from previous reports of sensorimotor neuropathy in
upper airways [5–10, 29, 30], cytoskeletal abnormalities in
muscles have to be taken into account in the pathophysi-
ology of pharyngeal dysfunction in snorers and sleep
apnea patients. Any changes rendering the upper-airway
muscles less capable of generating force have the potential
to affect pharyngeal function.
The high proportion of fibres with disorganized desmin
as well as histopathological changes such as atrophic and
hypertrophic fibres, fascicular atrophy and fibrosis in the
palate muscles of snorer and sleep apnea reflect muscle
weakness in the upper airways due to local injury. The
disorganization of desmin often resembled the pattern
seen in myofibrillar myopathies where the primary clinical
feature is progressive muscle weakness [22, 31]. The

 pathogenesis of these two distinct types of changes seem,
however, to differ. While the presence of atrophic fibers is
probably due to acquired motor neuropathy secondary to
snoring vibratory damage [5, 12–14, 32], the desmin disor-
ganized fibres seems preferably related to myofibrillar in-
jury and muscle overload. This assumption is based on
the fact that hypertrophic fibres also displayed disorga-
nized desmin, indicating a frequent use and thus an intact
nerve-innervation. Moreover, cytoskeletal disruption has
been reported in muscle fibres subjected to overload [33,
34]. Nonetheless, denervation cannot be excluded for the
changes of desmin observed in fibres of smaller size. Volo-
din et al., [35] reported that slow muscle fibre atrophy
induced by denervation initially causes phosphorylation
and ubiquitination of desmin, followed by dissociation of
desmin filaments and protein degradation. However, this
process may account for desmin abnormalities in fibres
with an atrophic appearance, but not for the abnormalities
in the hypertrophic fibres.
Another possible basis for desmin abnormalities is
local disturbances in blood circulation in snorers. There
is evidence that long-standing exposure to mechanical
vibrations in limbs causes vascular damage, reduction in
blood flow, mitochondrial disorganization, as well as
cytoskeletal derangement and decreased muscle strength
[36–38]. Disturbed blood circulation in limb muscles
due to peripheral artery disease (PAD) has also been
shown to cause an abnormal distribution of desmin as
well as an aberrant muscle fibre morphology including
irregular and patchy distribution of the mitochondria

 [39]. Interestingly, this maldistribution of desmin and
mitochondria resembles the abnormal derangement of
desmin and mitochondrial distribution previously re-
ported in palate muscle fibres of patients [40]. Desmin
has a key role in anchoring of mitochondria, and muta-
tions of desmin are reported to substantially disturb
spatial orientation and function of mitochondria in mus-
cles [18, 19]. Accordingly, disorganization of desmin and
mitochondria, together with our previous findings of re-
duced
muscle
capillarization
in
the
soft
palate
of
long-term snorers [41], underpins a disturbed energy
production and muscle weakness.
The novel finding of muscle fibres lacking desmin in
the soft palate of both patients as well as healthy adult
and infants [15], raises interesting questions about their
origin. Muscle fibres containing disorganized or dis-
rupted desmin have been described in several myop-
athies [31], but no disease or neuromuscular injuries
have been related to lack of desmin in muscle fibres. Al-
though a transient loss of desmin has been observed in
muscles following acute or eccentric activity in animal
experiments, the expression of desmin returned to nor-
mal levels after a short time [33, 34]. Interestingly, Jan-
baz et al. [42] reported that a subgroup of fibres in
healthy human extraocular muscles lacked or had faint
staining for desmin. Extraocular muscles have, as palate
muscles, intricate muscle anatomy with several muscles
lacking firm attachment at one end and acting against
each other in performing precise movements of the eye.
In light of this, the presence of fibres lacking desmin can
constitute an evolutionary cytoskeletal specialization of
the muscle fibres to meet requirements in various oro-
pharyngeal functions. Additionally, while desmin disor-
ganized fibres did not have any fibre type predilection,
fibres lacking desmin were mainly of slow phenotype I, a
finding further strengthening cytoskeletal fibre pheno-
type specialization. Thus, the significantly higher propor-
tion of fibres with an absence of desmin in muscles from
patients compared to healthy controls indicates either a
genetic link or that these fibres better survive muscle
overload or neuromuscular trauma by snoring and tissue
stretch. Since fibres lacking desmin preferentially were
of slow type I, the high proportion of desmin negative fi-
bres in snoring and sleep apnea patients could relate to
the fact that the motor-nerve damage preferentially af-
fects fibres belonging to type II motor-units, which is in
line with some previous studies [7, 12]. The reason why
cytoskeletal abnormalities in certain fibres were only ob-
served in specific regions along the length of myofibril
needs further investigation.
Another significant finding was that a subpopulation
of the desmin-abnormal fibres also lacked immunoreac-
tivity for the C-terminus of dystrophin. The C-terminus
domain of the dystrophin molecule is considered to be
crucial for normal muscle function, as it binds to the
glycoprotein complex in the sarcolemma and transfers
forces from the contractile apparatus to the extracellular
matrix and adjoining muscle fibres [20, 23]. Physiological
studies demonstrated that force production is signifi-
cantly reduced in muscle fibres showing a deficiency of
dystrophin [43]. Moreover, extensive data report that a
dystrophin-deficient sarcolemma is fragile and results in
increased permeability of membrane-impermeable mole-
cules, especially after physical exercise. In Duchenne
muscular dystrophy, loss or truncated forms of dys-
trophin
leave
the
membrane
highly
susceptible
to
contraction-induced
injury
and
hypoxic
stress
[44],
which
has
deleterious
consequences
for
the
intra-myofibrillar environment. Thus, the high propor-
tion of dystrophin C-terminus deficient fibres in snorers
and sleep apnea patients might render the muscle more
vulnerable to high contraction stress.
Utrophin, a paralog to dystrophin, is expressed on the
sarcolemma of developing and regenerating fibres, but it
is ultimately replaced by dystrophin in maturing fibres
[45]. In Duchenne muscular dystrophy, where dystrophin

respectively (mean and SD). A significant difference (p < 0.05) is marked (*)

 is lacking, utrophin is strikingly upregulated [46]. How-
ever, utrophin was not upregulated in muscle fibres lack-
ing immunoexpression for the dystrophin C-terminus in
both patients and controls. Hence, further studies have to
rule out whether the truncated form of dystrophin in des-
min abnormal fibres is a consequence of local injuries or
that the C-terminal of the dystrophin molecule has a spe-
cific configuration in soft palate muscles.
Several investigators have proposed that obstructive
sleep apnea is a progressive heavy snorers disease [47–49].
Our findings reinforce traumatic snoring vibrations as well
as muscle overload as the most credible mechanism for
the high presence of fibres with abnormal cytoskeletal dis-
tribution in patients. This is strengthened by the observa-
tion that alpha-actinin was weakly stained or deranged in
most of the desmin abnormal fibres in patients, while all
fibres in controls, irrespectively of desmin expression,
showed an intact Z disk structure. Additionally, the find-
ings that long-standing exposure to vibrations causes
nerve and muscle injuries, including cytoskeletal and
mitochondrial disorganization, vascular damage, reduction
in blood flow, and decreased muscle strength further sup-
port vibratory trauma as a cause for structural muscle
changes. Moreover, contraction during lengthening of
muscle has been reported to cause histopathological
changes in muscle fibres [34], a process that can occur
during sleep when the dilator muscles try to counteract
the collapsing forces while breathing. Therefore, nerve
and muscle injuries, as well as disturbances in blood flow,
may affect pharyngeal function in snorers that over time
contributes to the development of sleep apnea. Treatment
strategies aimed at reducing trauma from snoring and
muscle
overload,
as
well
as
strengthening
the
upper-airway muscles, could have long-term benefits.
Although the proportion of desmin and dystrophin ab-
normalities in sleep apnea patients were significantly
higher than in controls, no relation to the severity of sleep
apnea (AHI) could be established. This reflects the com-
plex interaction of several central and peripheral etio-
logical risk factors in the development and progression of
obstructive sleep apnea [50]. Hence, the impact of cyto-
skeletal abnormalities on upper airway muscle function
should be considered together with factors such as the de-
gree of muscle relaxation during sleep, upper airway anat-
omy, nerve injuries, and other co-morbid conditions in
snorers and sleep apnea patients. Future studies with lar-
ger cohorts could shed more light on the question if a par-
ticular genotype or phenotype of patients exists based on
the present findings in snorers and sleep apnea patients.
Conclusions
To conclude, the present data show that the expression
of cytoskeletal proteins in muscle fibres of the soft palate
in snoring and sleep apnea patients differ from healthy
individuals and from limb muscles. Cytoskeletal abnor-
malities including absence, disorganization, and accumu-
lation of desmin as well as a truncated form of
dystrophin were common in the soft palate muscles of
patients, but not in controls. The link between cytoskel-
etal abnormalities and swallowing dysfunction supports
impaired muscle function in the upper airways of pa-
tients. Hence, in addition to neuropathy, cytoskeletal
myopathy seems to be a contributing factor in the
pathophysiology of pharyngeal muscle dysfunction in the
upper airways of sleep apnea patients.
