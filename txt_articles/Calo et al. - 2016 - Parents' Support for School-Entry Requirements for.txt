Abstract
Background: The number of states proposing school-entry
requirements for human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination has
increased over the last decade. However, data are currently limited
regarding parents' support of such laws. We sought to obtain the
first national estimates of parents' support of HPV vaccination
school-entry requirements.
Methods: A national sample of 1,501 parents of 11- to 17-year-
old children completed a web-based survey between November
2014 and January 2015. Analyses used multivariable logistic
regression to assess correlates of support for school-entry require-
ments for HPV vaccination.
Results: Overall, 21% of parents agreed that laws requiring
HPV vaccination for school attendance "are a good idea," and
54% disagreed. If school-entry requirements included opt-out
provisions, agreement increased to 57%, and only 21% disagreed.
Parents more often agreed with requirements without opt-out
provisions if they were Hispanic [OR ¼ 1.53; 95% confidence
interval (CI), 1.05–2.22], believed HPV vaccine was as or more
important than other adolescent vaccines (OR ¼ 2.76; 95% CI,
1.98–3.83), or believed HPV vaccine was effective for preventing
cervical cancer (OR ¼ 2.55; 95% CI, 1.93–3.37). Parents less often
agreed if they resided in Midwest states or believed that HPV
vaccine was being pushed to make money for drug companies
(both P < 0.05).
Conclusion: Opt-out provisions almost tripled parents' sup-
port for HPV vaccine school-entry requirements. Our findings
suggest that race/ethnicity, attitudes about HPV vaccine, and
region of residence may influence support for requirements
without opt-out provisions.
Impact: Opt-out provisions greatly increase parent support of
school-entry requirements for HPV vaccination but may make them
ineffective. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev; 25(9); 1317–25. �2016 AACR.
Introduction
Human papillomavirus (HPV)-attributable diseases are a seri-
ous public health threat in the United States (1). Nearly 80 million
Americans are infected with at least one type of HPV (2), and HPV
types 16 and 18 are responsible for more than 22,000 new cases of
cancer each year (3). Most HPV-associated cancers could be
prevented through widespread HPV vaccination (1). For this
reason, national guidelines recommend routine and timely HPV
vaccination of boys and girls at age 11 or 12 (4). However, HPV
vaccine coverage is low, lagging far behind other adolescent
vaccines. Among 13- to 17-year-olds, only 40% of girls and
22% of boys had completed the HPV vaccine series by 2014
(5). These coverage levels fall considerably short of the Healthy
People 2020 goal of having 80% of 13- to 15-year-olds fully
vaccinated (6).
In the United States, policy interventions, such as school-entry
requirements, have contributed to high uptake of adolescent
vaccination and, in turn, low prevalence of many vaccine-pre-
ventable diseases (7–9). The Task Force on Community Preven-
tive Services recommends school-entry requirements as an evi-
dence-based strategy to increase vaccine coverage (10). Requiring
vaccination as a condition to school attendance is within state's
legislative power to protect the public's health. As of 2016, all 50
states and Washington, D.C. have vaccine requirements for school
entry. All of these laws allow for medical exemptions (11), which
typically require a physician's certificate stating that a vaccination
would be harmful. Most states also allow nonmedical exemp-
tions; 47 states permit religious exemptions and 18 states allow
philosophical exemptions on the basis of personal, moral, or
other beliefs against vaccination (11). States differ in the process
parents must go through to get a nonmedical exemption (12–14).
In states where there is no rigorous process for claiming the
exemption, more people opt out of vaccination (15).
The unprecedented opportunity to prevent HPV-associated
cancers through vaccination led many states to propose laws
requiring HPV vaccine for school attendance, similar to those
for tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis (Tdap). Since Michigan

 introduced the first legislation requiring HPV vaccination for
school entry in September 2006, 24 other states and Washington,
D.C. have proposed similar laws (16). However, only Virginia and
Washington, D.C. have enacted such legislation into law, with
Rhode Island more recently adopting the policy by means of
administrative ruling. Ethical, political, and legal concerns from
opponents have been the focus of the policy debate (17–19),
shifting discussions away from the demonstrated effectiveness of
HPV vaccination to prevent many cancers (20, 21).
Policymakers consider their constituents' opinions as they
decide how to act on health policies (22), including HPV vacci-
nation school-entry requirements (17). However, data are cur-
rently limited regarding parents' support for these laws. Previous
studies were limited to samples in Georgia (23), North Carolina
(24), and Los Angeles, California (25) and happened prior to
ACIP recommendations that boys routinely receive HPV vaccina-
tion. To fill this large gap in the literature, we conducted a national
survey among parents of 11- to 17-year-old boys and girls to better
understand their support for these laws. The aims of our study
were to: (i) assess parents' support for HPV vaccine school-entry
requirements, without and with opt-out provisions, and (ii)
identify correlates of parental support for such laws. We hypoth-
esized higher support for school-entry requirements when includ-
ing opt-out provisions and among parents with positive attitudes
about HPV vaccine.
Materials and Methods
Participants and procedures
Participants were members of an existing, national panel of
non-institutionalized U.S. adults maintained by a survey research
company (26). The company constructed the panel using prob-
ability-based sampling of list-assisted, random-digit dialed
(RDD) phone numbers supplemented by address-based sam-
pling (ABS). The ABS strategy was incorporated in response to
the growing number of cell phone–only households that are
outside the traditional RDD landline telephone frame. Thus, our
overall sampling design captured households with landline
phones, cell phone–only households, and households without
telephones. Eligible panel members were parents of at least one
11- to 17-year-old child living primarily in their households. The
survey instructed respondents with more than one age-eligible
child to respond with regard to the child with the most recent
birthday.
The survey company emailed invitations to a random sample of
2,845 panel members, and 1,760 responded by visiting the survey
website, confirming eligibility criteria, and providing informed
consent. A total of 1,504 parents were eligible and completed the
survey between November 2014 and January 2015. After account-
ing for ineligible respondents (n ¼ 335) and excluding respon-
dents who failed to complete at least two-thirds of the survey (n ¼
14), the survey response rate was 61%, calculated using American
Association for Public Opinion Research Response Rate 5 (27).
For the current study, we also excluded respondents who did not
provide data on the main outcome variable (n ¼ 3). The final
analytic sample had 1,501 parents. Forty-three respondents (3%
of the sample) came from Virginia and Washington, D.C., which
had HPV vaccine school-entry requirements in place at the time of
the survey. Since we sought to obtain the first national estimate of
support for such requirements, we included these parents in our
sample.
Prior to fielding the survey, we cognitively tested our instru-
ment with 18 parents of adolescents to maximize respondent
comprehension. We then pretested the survey online with 26
panel members to ensure proper functioning. The survey instru-
ment is available online at www.unc.edu/~ntbrewer/hpv.htm.
The University of North Carolina Institutional Review Board
approved the study protocol.
Measures
Following the approach of previous studies (24, 25), our survey
introduced respondents to HPV vaccine school-entry require-
ments with the prompt, "Some states are trying to pass laws that
would require all 11 and 12 year-olds to get HPV vaccine before
they are allowed to start 6th grade." Parents then said whether they
agreed with the statement, "I think these laws are a good idea"
using a 5-point response scale. Parents who did not agree with the
previous statement received an additional item: "It is okay to have
these laws only if parents can opt out if they want to." For each
statement, we categorized parents as agreeing (somewhat or
strongly agree) or disagreeing/neither (somewhat or strongly
disagree, or neither disagree or agree).
The survey assessed key candidate correlates previously iden-
tified in the literature as potential predictors of parental support of
HPV vaccine school-entry requirements (24, 25). The survey
company provided data on parents' sex, race/ethnicity, educa-
tional attainment, annual household income, and location of
residence in terms of U.S. state and region. We created a variable to
assess whether respondents had their residence in a state that
requires HPV vaccination for school attendance. We dichoto-
mized this variable as yes (respondents from Virginia and
Washington, D.C.) and no (respondents from other states). The
survey also assessed the sex and age of the index child, and
whether parents had received a provider recommendation for
HPV vaccination for that child. The survey assessed HPV vacci-
nation status with one item: "How many shots of the HPV vaccine
has [child's name] had?" We defined HPV vaccine initiation as
responses of �1 shots.
Rules or regulations (e.g., requiring vaccination for school
attendance) that people perceive as threatening personal free-
doms can elicit a motivational state, reactance, which is charac-
terized by anger and counter arguing and may elicit oppositional
behavior (e.g., refusing vaccination; ref. 28). The survey assessed
psychologic reactance with three items: "I become frustrated when
I am unable to make free and independent decisions," "Regula-
tions trigger a sense of resistance in me," and "When someone
forces me to do something, I feel like doing the opposite." These
items had a 5-point response scale that ranged from "strongly
disagree" to "strongly agree". We created an index of reactance by
calculating the mean response value and creating two categories:
low (<4) and high (4–5).
The survey assessed parents' agreement with statements shown
to be associated with HPV vaccination uptake in the United States
(29) and support for school-entry requirements for HPV vacci-
nation (24, 25). The survey assessed perceptions regarding harms
of HPV vaccines (e.g., "The HPV vaccine might cause lasting health
problems"), barriers to vaccination (e.g., "It would be hard to find
a provider or clinic where I can afford HPV vaccine for my child"),
vaccine effectiveness (e.g., "The HPV vaccine is effective in pre-
venting cervical cancer"), and uncertainty about the vaccine (e.g.,
"I don't have enough information about the HPV vaccine to
decide whether to give it to my child"). We adapted these items

 from the Carolina HPV Immunization Attitudes and Beliefs Scale
(29). The 5-point response scale ranged from "strongly disagree"
to "strongly agree."
The survey also assessed importance of HPV vaccination with
the statement: "I felt that the HPV vaccine for [child's name] is. . .,"
accompanied by a 5-point response scale that ranged from "not
important" to "extremely important." The survey repeated the
same statement for meningococcal and Tdap vaccines. We calcu-
lated relative vaccine importance, giving a score of 1 if parents
rated HPV vaccine as important as, or more important than, the
average score for Tdap and meningococcal vaccines and 0
otherwise.
Statistical analysis
We calculated the percentage of support for HPV vaccine
school-entry requirements, without and with opt-out provisions.
We used bivariate logistic regressions to identify bivariate associa-
tions of candidate correlates with support for HPV vaccine
requirements. We then entered covariates showing associations
(P < 0.05) in bivariate analyses into a multivariable logistic
regression model. We used separate logistic regression models to
assess the associations between potential correlates and HPV
vaccine requirements without and with opt-out provisions. Sta-
tistical tests were two-tailed with a critical alpha of 0.05. We
conducted analyses using Stata 12.0.
Results
Respondents included residents of all 50 states and Washington
D.C., and 33% were from the South (Table 1). About one-fifth
(22%) had a household income of less than $35,000 per year.
Parents were evenly split between having reported on a son (51%)
or a daughter (49%), and the mean age of children was 14 years.
Forty-six percent of children had received at least 1 dose of HPV
vaccine. Fifty-six percent of parents were female, and the majority
were non-Hispanic white (70%) or Hispanic (14%). More than
one-third (38%) of parents had a high school degree or less
education. Almost three-fourths (73%) of the sample scored low
in the 3-item index of psychologic reactance. About half (52%) of
parents had received a provider recommendation for HPV
vaccination.
Regarding HPV vaccine attitudes, about half (51%) of parents
said that HPV vaccine was as or more important than the Tdap and
meningococcal vaccines (Table 1). Nearly one-fourth (23%) of
the sample thought that HPV vaccine might cause lasting health
problems and about one-third (32%) thought that HPV vaccine
was being pushed to make money for drug companies. Thirty-two
percent of parents said that they did not have enough information
about HPV vaccine to decide whether to vaccinate their children
and only 40% agreed that the vaccine was effective in preventing
cervical cancer. Few parents (6%) said that it would be hard to find
a provider or clinic where they can afford HPV vaccine for their
children.
Support for HPV vaccine requirements without opt-out
provisions
Twenty-one percent of parents agreed that laws requiring HPV
vaccination for school attendance "are a good idea" (Fig. 1).
Hispanic parents had higher odds [OR ¼ 1.53; 95% confidence
interval (CI), 1.05–2.22] of agreeing with HPV vaccine school-
entry requirements than non-Hispanic whites in multivariable
analysis (Table 2). Likewise, parents more often agreed with these
requirements if they believed that HPV vaccine was as or more
important than other adolescent vaccines (OR ¼ 2.76, 95% CI,
1.98–3.83), that HPV vaccine was effective for preventing cervical
cancer (OR¼ 2.55, 95% CI, 1.93–3.37), orthat itwould behard to
find a provider or clinic where they can afford the vaccine for their
children (OR ¼ 2.50; 95% CI, 1.45–4.33). On the other hand,
parents less often agreed with school-entry requirements if they
believed that HPV vaccines were being pushed to make money for
drug companies (OR ¼ 0.47; 95% CI, 0.32–0.69) or resided in
Midwest states compared with Northeast states (OR ¼ 0.64; 95%
CI, 0.42–0.98). In bivariate, but not multivariate analyses, agree-
ment with school-entry requirements was associated (P < 0.05)
with living in a state requiring HPV vaccination for school
attendance, having initiated HPV vaccination, having received a
provider recommendation for HPV vaccination, lower psycho-
logic reactance, and believing that HPV vaccine might cause
lasting health problems and that respondents do not have enough
information to decide whether to give the vaccine to their
children.
Support for HPV vaccine requirements that include opt-out
provisions
Support for HPV vaccine school-entry requirements increased
to 57% when including parents who agreed "these laws are okay
only if parents can opt out" (Fig. 1). Support for HPV vaccine
requirements also increased when examined for each variable
independently associated with agreeing that school-entry require-
ments "are a good idea" (Fig. 2). In multivariable analysis, when
including agreement with opt-out provisions, parents who
believed HPV vaccine was effective in preventing cervical cancer
(OR ¼ 2.18; 95% CI, 1.73–2.74) and believed HPV vaccine was as
or more important than Tdap and meningococcal vaccines (OR ¼
1.29; 95% CI, 1.02–1.66) still had higher odds of agreeing with
school-entry requirements (data not shown). When opt-out pro-
visions were included, no other variable associated with agreeing
school-entry requirements "are a good idea" remained associated
in multivariable analysis.
Discussion
The current study, to our knowledge, is the first to employ a
national sample to assess parental attitudes about HPV vaccine
school-entry requirements. We found that 21% of parents agreed
that school-entry requirements "are a good idea." Previous studies
reported higher levels of support than we observed; 46% of
parents in five southeastern North Carolina counties (24) and
59% in Los Angeles (25) agreed with HPV vaccine school-entry
requirements. However, such levels of support could be particular
to those study participants and may not be generalizable to the
general population because data were collected from individuals
who lived in counties with elevated cervical cancer rates (25) or
participated in a study about sexually transmitted infections (24).
In addition, previous estimates of support could be higher
because the response scale did not have a midpoint response
option, thus requiring participants to take either side of agree or
disagree scale. In the current study, we found that 25% of the
sample neither agreed nor disagreed with HPV vaccine school-
entry requirements. Although some scholars debate that provid-
ing this response option makes it easier to respondents to avoid
the mental process necessary to select their true response (30),

 others also argue that not everyone has strong thoughts one way or
the other, even for very polarized policy issues (31). Public
education and social marketing campaigns may be important for
increasing support among parents who held middle-of-the-road
attitudes about HPV vaccine requirements (32, 33).
Agreement with HPV vaccine school-entry requirements almost
tripled when opt-out provisions were mentioned to parents, and
disagreement decreased from 54% to 21%. Although vaccine opt-
out provisions vary across state jurisdictions, in general, such
provisions allow parents to refuse vaccination for any reasons.
Previous research showed that some parents opt out vaccination
for their child, or filenon-medical exemptions, because opting out
is far more convenient than completing the immunization sched-
ule for school attendance (34). Broader opt-out provisions for
HPV vaccination may have the effect of creating a culture of
vaccine refusal and may lead parents to seek exemptions for other
vaccines (19, 35). In Virginia and Washington, D.C., parents have
broad authority to opt out HPV vaccination, but procedures vary
by jurisdiction. Although both jurisdictions provide parents with
information about HPV infection and the benefits of vaccination,

 only Washington, D.C. requires parents to sign a standardized
form to opt out HPV vaccination. The impact of this process on
HPV vaccination is unknown. The 2014 National Immunization
Survey–Teen (NIS-Teen) shows that Virginia's coverage for HPV
vaccine initiation (59%) and 3-dose series completion (36%) for
females aged 13–17 were below national averages (60% and 39%,
respectively; ref. 5). On the other hand, Washington, D.C. had one
of the highest coverage levels for HPV vaccine initiation (75%)
and completion (57%) in the U.S. Research is needed to inves-
tigate the extent to which different forms of opt-out provisions
may contribute to or detract from vaccination.
A growing number of states are tightening opt-out provision
and non-medical exemption requirements (36). Several states, for
example, require parents to submit documentation that they
received information about the benefits and risks of vaccination
from health care providers before opting out (37). Similar infor-
mational steps and application processes might be added to
existing and future HPV vaccine school-entry requirement laws
to reduce the likelihood that parents will opt-out vaccination
solely for convenience. It is also important to note that vaccine
advocates have expressed caution that a poorly timed push for
HPV vaccine school-entry requirements or changes in opt-out
provision rules might provoke a public backlash (13, 18). In light
of previous failures legislating HPV vaccine requirements, such
policies should be judiciously conceived and well supported by
key stakeholders (13, 17).
Our data showed that parents were less likely to agree with HPV
vaccine school-entry requirements if they resided in Midwest
states compared with Northeast states. This finding is novel in
the literature because no previous research has examined support
for such requirements across U.S. regions or states. Public support
for school-entry requirements is key for state legislatures to
introduce and enact such proposals (17), so understanding par-
ents' attitudes towards these requirements is important for
informing state policy discussions. An analysis of HPV vaccine
legislation reveals different patterns of legislative activity across U.
S. regions (16). Since 2006, only half of the 12 states comprising
the Midwest region introduced legislation requiring HPV vacci-
nation for school attendance, and none of those policies was
subsequently considered for enactment. In contrast, two-thirds of
the 9 states in the Northeast region introduced legislation to adopt
HPV vaccine school-entry requirements with Rhode Island suc-
cessfully passing an administrative policy on the matter. Alterna-
tively, three quarters of Midwestern states enacted laws to fund or
educate the public or school children about HPV vaccination
versus only a third of states in the Northeast region. Taken
together, these data suggested that Midwest states have responded
introducing and enacting legislation aimed to increase funding
and information about the vaccine rather than require HPV
vaccination for school entry. Our finding that parents living in
the Midwest expressed low levels of support for HPV vaccine
school-entry requirements may shed some light with regard to the
failure of state legislatures in introducing and passing such leg-
islation. Although, in the absence of school-entry requirements,
other laws alone are unlikely to considerably raise HPV vaccine
coverage rates, laws to increase awareness of and access to HPV
vaccination may serve to complement state immunization pro-
grams (38). Research on the public's opinions about a range of
HPV vaccine policy strategies is needed to ensure that new
legislative developments are carefully conceived and supported
by state's constituents.
Support for school-entry requirements was higher among
Hispanic parents compared to other racial/ethnic groups. This
finding is consistent with a previous study showing that HPV
vaccine requirements for school entry were highly acceptable to
Hispanics (25, 39). Data from the 2014 NIS-Teen showed
higher rates of HPV vaccine initiation and 3-dose completion
among Hispanic adolescents aged 13–17 than their non-His-
panic white counterparts (5). Hispanics' cultural factors may
explain their higher uptake of HPV vaccine and greater agree-
ment with school-entry requirements compared with other
populations (40). Robitz and colleagues (25) argued that
Hispanics had a strong "respect for authority figures" and so,
Hispanic parents may be more likely to agree with vaccine
requirements because they are more likely to follow advice
from health care professionals. Although we were unable to
assess the effect of any cultural factors on the level of support
for HPV vaccine school-entry requirements, previous data
showed that Hispanic parents responding to survey research
in Spanish were more supportive of such immunization
requirements than those responding in English (25). Interest-
ingly, other studies show a more positive effect of acculturation
with regard to HPV vaccination. Gerend and colleagues (41),
for example, reported that Hispanic parents who are more
acculturated into U.S. society were more likely to get the HPV
vaccine for their daughters. The specific mechanisms that
account for the relationships between Hispanic ethnicity, accul-
turation, HPV vaccine uptake, and support for school-entry
requirements are understudied. Nonetheless, the finding that
Hispanics are consistently more supportive of HPV vaccine

 school-entry requirements suggests that Hispanic communities
might be important partners in advocacy and vaccine campaign
mobilization efforts.
We found that parents who believed HPV vaccine was as or
more important than other adolescent vaccines were more likely
to support school-entry requirements. In previous surveys we
conducted with family physicians and pediatricians (42, 43),
many reported that they endorse HPV vaccine less strongly than
Tdap or meningococcal vaccines, often discuss it last, or recom-
mend the vaccine as an optional vaccine. These low quality
recommendation practices not only discourage parents from
vaccinating their children but may also add distrust and suspicion
with regard to HPV vaccine policies. As physicians are an impor-
tant source of vaccine information for parents (44, 45), better
physician's communication practices about HPV vaccine in rela-
tion to other adolescent vaccines may influence parents' opinions
about school-entry requirements. We also found that parents who
had favorable perceptions of HPV vaccine effectiveness were more
likely to support school-entry requirements. Our finding is con-
sistent with previous research (25) and highlights the importance
of continuing to communicate that the vaccine is a safe and
effective health service to prevent cervical cancer, which kills
4,000 U.S. women each year. As HPV vaccine is recommended
for boys and girls, information about parents' perceptions of
vaccine effectiveness in preventing other HPV-attributable cancers
may be important to increase support for school-entry require-
ments. Consistent with previous studies (24, 25), concerns about
the involvement of drug companies in pushing HPV vaccination
to make money were also associated with parents' opinions about
HPV vaccine school-entry requirements. Many authors argued
that drug company lobbying, while not illegal, fueled the public
belief that school-entry requirements were legislated solely to
benefit such companies (18, 21). Our finding suggests that efforts
for maintaining public trust in public health systems are crucial
both for improving HPV vaccination and for the viability of
legislating school-entry requirements.
Strengths of this research include a large, national sample of
parents and a good survey response rate. In addition, the current
study is the first to assess support for HPV vaccine school-entry
requirements after the ACIP recommended that boys be routinely
vaccinated. This study had several limitations. The survey asked
about hypothetical school-entry requirements, rather than actual
laws, and did not describe the scope of opt-out provisions.
Parents' support for school-entry requirements could differ when
asked about actual legislation and may vary by type of opt-out
provision (medical, religious, or philosophical exemptions).
Future research should explore how support for school-entry
requirements and correlates of parental support change with
different types of opt-out provisions. The sample included 70%
non-Hispanic Whites, which is a slightly higher proportion than
the 62% of U.S. adults who identify themselves as such. Even so,
our sample included meaningful numbers of non-Hispanic Black
(9%) and Hispanic (14%) respondents, making this survey more
racially and ethnically diverse than previous studies on this topic.
Another limitation is that the survey was administered in English,
so participants with limited English proficiency might have faced
difficulties interpreting or responding to survey questions.
Although participants needed an email account to receive an
invitation to participate in the survey, the survey company facil-
itated the participation of respondents with lower access to
technology by providing a laptop computer and free Internet
access to those panel members who lacked these resources.
Although we focused on parents, we acknowledge that there are
other key stakeholders contributing to policy considerations
surrounding HPV vaccine school-entry requirements. Developing
sound policy will require incorporating the perspectives of policy-
makers including whether these requirements should include
nonmedical exemptions and, in such a case, the ease with which
these opt-out provisions can be obtained by parents and reviewed
by state officials (17). Research is needed to identify influential
factors in determining how policymakers act on the issue of HPV
vaccine requirements. Importantly, the perspectives of medical

 associations, state health departments, and school districts are
also influential to the policymaking process. A recent study
showed that 47% of physicians who provide primary care, includ-
ing vaccines, to adolescents support HPV vaccine school-entry
requirements (46). These stakeholders have been key actors
advocating about health policies in the United States (47).
Because school-entry requirements are legislated on a state-by-
state basis in the United States, challenges arise with regard to the
capacity of states to provide school-required vaccines, monitor
compliance, and enforce such policies (48). Our study provides
key information about the perspectives of parents towards HPV
vaccine school-entry requirements, which can inform state policy
discussions about this important topic.
Conclusion
Improving HPV vaccination coverage is a national priority.
While school-entry requirements have proven to be a valuable
policy mechanism to raise childhood and adolescent vaccination
coverage in the United States, they have also engendered contro-
versy and debate in the case of HPV vaccination. Although school-
entry requirements are viewed by some parents as an interference
with parental autonomy and freedom of choice (21), through the
years, other types of public health legislation (e.g., smoking
restrictions, car seat belts, motorcycle helmets) have succeeded
in the face of similar concerns (49). As many scholars suggest,
before proposing HPV vaccine requirements states must strength-
en their immunization programs and ensure that their constitu-
ents understand the benefits of HPV vaccination (18, 50). Like-
wise, the National Vaccine Advisory Committee recommends that
states considering HPV vaccine school-entry requirements con-
sider a range of issues including vaccine infrastructure and financ-
ing, disease burden and epidemiology, existing vaccine policies,
and political and public support (35, 51). Thorough consider-
ation of such issues will allow policymakers to address critical
elements related to HPV vaccine requirements to ensure that new
legislative proposals are carefully designed and supported by the
public. Our study provides the first national assessment of par-
ents' attitudes about HPV vaccine school-entry requirement; our
findings suggest that distinctive characteristics of the population
may influence support for such laws. Support of school-entry
requirements for HPV vaccination continues to be contingent
upon the inclusion of opt-out provisions, which may negatively
impact the effectiveness of these laws.
