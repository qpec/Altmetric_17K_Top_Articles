The stigmatization of people with obesity is widespread and causes harm. 
Weight stigma is often propagated and tolerated in society because 
of beliefs that stigma and shame will motivate people to lose weight. 
However, rather than motivating positive change, this stigma contributes 
to behaviors such as binge eating, social isolation, avoidance of health care 
services, decreased physical activity, and increased weight gain, which 
worsen obesity and create additional barriers to healthy behavior change. 
Furthermore, experiences of weight stigma also dramatically impair quality 
of life, especially for youth. Health care professionals continue to seek 
effective strategies and resources to address the obesity epidemic; however, 
they also frequently exhibit weight bias and stigmatizing behaviors. This 
policy statement seeks to raise awareness regarding the prevalence and 
negative effects of weight stigma on pediatric patients and their families 
and provides 6 clinical practice and 4 advocacy recommendations regarding 
the role of pediatricians in addressing weight stigma. In summary, these 
recommendations include improving the clinical setting by modeling best 
practices for nonbiased behaviors and language; using empathetic and 
empowering counseling techniques, such as motivational interviewing, and 
addressing weight stigma and bullying in the clinic visit; advocating for 
inclusion of training and education about weight stigma in medical schools, 
residency programs, and continuing medical education programs; and 
empowering families to be advocates to address weight stigma in the home 
environment and school setting.
abstract
More children in the United States suffer from obesity than from any 
other chronic condition, with one-third of US children and youth having 
overweight or obesity and 17% of children 2 to 19 years of age having 
obesity.‍1 In some pediatric populations, such as children living in 
economically challenged communities, as many as two-thirds of children 
have overweight or obesity.‍2 Although some promising signs suggest the 
prevalence of obesity may be stabilizing, rates remain unacceptably high,

 and some studies suggest that the 
rate of children with severe obesity 
(BMI ≥120% of the 95th percentile) 
continues to increase.‍1, 
 
2
Although numerous efforts are 
underway to help children and 
adults reach and maintain a healthy 
weight, many such efforts do not 
address the social consequences 
of obesity, specifically weight 
stigmatization and discrimination.‍3 
Weight stigma refers to the societal 
devaluation of a person because he 
or she has overweight or obesity 
and often includes stereotypes that 
individuals with obesity are lazy, 
unmotivated, or lacking in willpower 
and discipline.‍ These stereotypes 
manifest in different ways, leading to 
prejudice, social rejection, and overt 
unfair treatment and discrimination.‍ 
For children and adolescents with 
overweight or obesity, weight stigma 
is primarily expressed as weight-
based victimization, teasing, and 
bullying.‍
Weight stigmatization is often 
propagated and tolerated in society 
because of beliefs that stigma 
and shame will motivate people 
to lose weight.‍4 However, rather 
than motivate positive change, this 
stigma contributes to behaviors 
such as binge eating, social isolation, 
avoidance of health care services, 
decreased physical activity, and 
increased weight gain over time, 
which worsen obesity and create 
barriers to healthy behavior change.‍5 
Experiences of weight stigma also 
dramatically impair quality of life, 
especially for youth.‍ A landmark 
study by Schwimmer et al6 revealed 
that children and adolescents with 
severe obesity had quality-of-life 
scores that were worse than age-
matched children who had cancer.‍ 
Furthermore, the manifestation of 
weight stigma is not isolated to older 
adolescents with severe levels of 
obesity, because negative weight-
based stereotypes toward children 
with overweight emerge as young 
as 3 years old.‍7 Importantly, peers 
are not the only sources of weight 
stigma.‍ Research documents weight 
stigma by parents and other family 
members, teachers, health care 
professionals, and society at large,  
including the popular media.‍3, 
 
8, 
 
9  
Thus, children are vulnerable to 
stigma and its negative consequences 
in school, at home, and in clinical 
settings.‍
Pediatricians and pediatric health 
care professionals strive to improve 
the health of patients through direct 
clinical care and through advocating 
for systemic and environmental 
change to support the health and 
success of patients in homes, schools, 
and communities.‍ Weight stigma 
is prevalent through numerous 
settings and negatively affects 
the health and success of patients 
across several domains, including 
personal and social development, 
education, and the workplace.‍ Many 
examples throughout the history 
of public health demonstrate that 
disease stigma is a legitimate barrier 
to prevention, intervention, and 
treatment.‍ Conditions such as HIV/
AIDS, various forms of cancer, 
alcoholism, and drug use were 
initially stigmatized and required 
considerable efforts by the medical 
field to reduce stigma-induced 
barriers that impaired effective 
treatment.‍10 Weight stigma is no 
exception but unfortunately remains 
an ongoing omission in approaches 
to address obesity.‍ To best support 
patients’ healthy changes, it is 
important to recognize, address, and 
advocate against weight stigma in all 
settings.‍

Weight Stigma in Youth
Weight stigma among youth is most 
often experienced as victimization, 
teasing, and bullying.‍ In the school 
setting, weight-based bullying is 
among the most frequent forms 
of peer harassment reported by 
students.‍ As early as preschool, 
young children attribute negative 
characteristics and stereotypes to 
peers with larger body sizes.‍11, 
 
12 By 
elementary school, negative weight-
based stereotypes are common.‍ 
Students are less likely to offer help 
to peers with overweight or obesity, 
and those with overweight or obesity 
are more likely to be bullied than are 
students of a healthier weight.‍12 
–14 
The likelihood of being targeted 
by verbal, relational, and physical 
victimization from peers increases 
with a student’s BMI percentile.‍ 
Longitudinal evidence demonstrates 
that weight status significantly 
predicts future victimization, with 
youth of the highest weight being 
the most vulnerable to bullying.‍15 
Recent evidence demonstrates that 
adolescents report the primary 
reason their peers are teased or 
bullied at school is because of their 
weight.‍16 Self-reported experiences 
of bullying, even among racially 
diverse samples of adolescents, 
indicate weight-based harassment 
is the most prevalent form of 
harassment reported by girls and 
the second-most common form of 
harassment among boys.‍17 A study 
of adolescents seeking weight loss 
treatment found that 71% reported 
being bullied about their weight in 
the past year, and more than one-
third indicated that the bullying had 
persisted for >5 years.‍9
Weight Stigma and parents and 
Educators
Perspectives of parents and 
educators have similarly identified 
weight-based bullying as a prevalent 
and problematic issue.‍ A 2011 
national study by the National 
Education Association examined 
perspectives of bullying among 
>5000 educators and found that 
weight-based bullying was viewed 
by teachers as the most problematic 
form of bullying in the classroom, 
more so than bullying because of 
a student’s sex, sexual orientation, 
or disability.‍18 In a national study

Downloaded from 
 of parents, having overweight was 
perceived by parents to be the 
most common reason youth are 
bullied, and these perspectives 
remained consistent regardless of 
their children’s weight status.‍19 
Furthermore, a recent multinational 
study (including the United States, 
Canada, Australia, and Iceland) 
showed that adults across these 
countries consistently viewed having 
overweight as the most common 
reason youth are bullied.‍20 Thus, 
reports by students, educators, and 
parents all point to weight-based 
bullying as a significant problem in 
the school setting.‍
Unfortunately, weight-based 
victimization of youth extends 
beyond peer relationships.‍ Increasing 
evidence indicates educators 
can be sources of weight stigma.‍ 
Experimental research shows that 
teachers have lower expectations of 
students with obesity than they have 
of students without obesity, including 
expectations of inferior physical, 
social, and academic abilities.‍21 Data 
from 5 waves of the Early Childhood 
Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten 
found that weight status in students 
was more negatively related to 
teachers’ assessments of their 
academic performance than to their 
test scores, indicating that teachers 
rate academic performance of 
students with obesity as worse than 
their test performance suggests.‍22 
Self-report studies have additionally 
demonstrated negative weight-
related stereotypes and beliefs 
among educators in the school 
setting.‍23 
– 
26
Of concern, parents have also been 
identified as a source of weight-
based victimization toward youth 
with obesity.‍ In a survey study of 
adolescents attending weight-loss 
camps, 37% reported they had been 
teased or bullied about their weight 
by a parent.‍9 Survey researchers 
assessing experiences of weight 
stigma among women with obesity 
found that family members were 
reported to be the most prevalent 
interpersonal source of weight-
stigma incidents, with 53% reporting 
weight stigma from their mothers 
and 44% reporting it from their 
fathers.‍27 Weight stigma expressed 
by parents can have a lasting effect 
on children, who continue to report 
emotional consequences from these 
experiences through adulthood.‍28
Weight Stigma and the media
Beyond the school and home settings, 
youth are additionally vulnerable 
to weight stigma through the 
media.‍ Content analyses of popular 
children’s television shows and 
movies reinforce weight stigma 
through stereotypical portrayals 
of characters who appear to have 
larger body sizes.‍ Characters who 
are visually slim in children’s 
media are often portrayed as being 
kind, popular, and attractive, but 
characters with larger body sizes are 
depicted as aggressive, unpopular, 
evil, unhealthy, and the target of 
humor or ridicule.‍29 
– 
31 A content 
analysis of recent children’s movies 
found 70% included weight-related 
stigmatizing content, of which 90% 
targeted characters with obesity.‍32 
Similarly, research examining 
popular adolescent television shows 
identified a significantly higher 
proportion of weight-stigmatizing 
content in youth-targeted shows 
(50%) compared with shows 
targeting a general audience 
(38.‍3%).‍33 Given that youth spend 
multiple hours per day watching 
television and other media, there 
is a considerable likelihood they 
are exposed to negative weight-
based stereotypes and stigma.‍34 
Furthermore, research has 
documented associations between 
greater media exposure among youth 
and increased expressions by those 
youth of weight stigma toward peers 
with overweight and obesity.‍35 Taken 
together, this evidence highlights 
youth-targeted media as sources of 
weight-based stereotypes that may 
reinforce and add to stigmatizing 
messages communicated to children 
at school and home.‍
Weight Stigma in health Care
Research shows that health care 
professionals express weight stigma 
toward patients with obesity, and 
patients with obesity frequently 
feel stigmatized in health care 
settings.‍36 Some research has 
found that more than two-thirds of 
women with overweight or obesity 
report being stigmatized about their 
weight by doctors.‍27 Health care 
professionals, including physicians, 
nurses, dietitians, psychologists, 
and medical trainees, self-report 
bias and prejudice toward patients 
with obesity.‍8, 
 
37 Research shows 
that physicians associate obesity 
with noncompliance and decreased 
medication adherence, hostility, 
dishonesty, and poor hygiene.‍ They 
often view patients with obesity  
as being lazy, lacking self-control,  
and being less intelligent.‍8, 
 
38  
Furthermore, this prejudice 
negatively affects quality of care and 
can result in patients with obesity 
being less likely to seek preventive 
care and delaying or canceling 
appointments.‍39 
– 
41 Physicians 
spend less time and engage in less 
discussion in office visits with 
patients with obesity than they 
do with patients with a lower BMI 
and are more reluctant to perform 
preventive health screenings, such 
as pelvic examinations, cancer 
screenings, and mammograms, for 
patients with obesity.‍ Psychologists 
have been shown to ascribe more 
pathology, more negative and severe 
symptoms, and worse prognosis 
to patients with obesity than to 
those at a healthier weight but with 
otherwise similar behavioral health 
histories.‍8, 
 
36, 
 
41 Anecdotal reports 
in the news suggest that patients 
have been denied care because 
they have obesity, which suggests 
a need for future studies exploring 
this discriminatory practice.‍42

 Additionally, patients with obesity 
have reported not being provided 
with appropriate-sized medical 
equipment, such as blood pressure 
cuffs and patient gowns, which 
results in a less welcoming clinical 
environment and affects the  
quality of the health care that is 
provided.‍8, 
38, 
 
43
When it comes to youth, even 
nuances in the language doctors use 
to discuss body weight with patients 
can lead to stigma and health care 
avoidance.‍ Parental perceptions of 
words commonly used to describe 
excess body weight were examined 
in a national study of parents of 
children 2 to 18 years of age.‍44 
Parents were asked to evaluate 10 
common words regarding the extent 
to which each word was desirable, 
stigmatizing, blaming, or motivating 
for weight loss.‍ The terms “fat, 
”  
“obese, 
” and “extremely obese” 
were rated as the most undesirable, 
stigmatizing, blaming, and least 
motivating.‍ In contrast, more neutral 
words like “weight” or “unhealthy 
weight” were rated as the most 
desirable and motivating for weight 
loss.‍44 
– 
46 When parents were asked 
how they would react if a doctor 
referred to their children’s weight in 
a stigmatizing way, 34% responded 
that they would switch doctors, and 
24% stated that they would avoid 
future medical appointments for 
their children.‍44 Limited literature 
has evaluated how health care 
professionals might most effectively 
and sensitively discuss weight with 
their patients and families and also 
with whom pediatric patients prefer 
to talk with about their weight.‍47, 
 
48 
These findings merit further study 
and underscore the importance 
of how health care professionals 
communicate with patients about 
obesity and weight-related health.‍
Traditionally, medical school and 
residency education have provided 
limited training regarding successful 
approaches to encouraging health 
behavior change (eg, motivational 
interviewing) and addressing obesity 
in patients and their families, leading 
health care professionals to report 
that they do not feel competent 
or comfortable discussing weight 
with their patients.‍49 
– 
51 More 
training is needed for trainees and 
practicing health care professionals 
regarding effective approaches to 
empowering children and families 
to make healthy changes.‍ There are 
different approaches to educating 
medical students and health care 
professionals about weight stigma, 
such as educational strategies that 
emphasize the complex causes of 
obesity (eg, biological, genetic, and 
environmental contributors beyond 
personal control), communication 
skills training, interacting with 
virtual standardized patients, and 
using brief educational films, role 
play, and dramatic readings in 
addition to traditional lecture-style 
learning.‍3, 
52 
–57 These approaches 
have been tested in different formats 
and can be incorporated into health 
care professional training programs.‍

Emotional and psychological Effects
Weight stigma poses numerous 
consequences for the psychological 
and physical health of children 
and adolescents, including adverse 
outcomes that may reinforce 
unhealthy behaviors that promote 
obesity and weight gain.‍ Experiences 
of weight-based teasing and bullying 
increase the risk for a range of 
emotional and psychological 
consequences for youth.‍ Evidence has 
documented increased vulnerability 
to depression, anxiety, substance use, 
low self-esteem, and poor body image 
among youth who are teased or 
bullied about their weight.‍58 
–62 These 
findings persist after accounting for 
factors such as age, sex, BMI, and 
age of obesity onset, which suggests 
stigmatizing experiences rather than 
just body weight are contributing 
to these negative outcomes.‍ Of 
concern, self-harm behaviors and 
suicidality are also higher among 
youth who have been teased or 
bullied about their weight compared 
with same-weight peers who have 
not been teased.‍ In addition to higher 
suicidal attempts reported among 
adolescents with obesity, research 
has found that the odds of thinking 
about and attempting suicide are 
approximately 2 times higher among 
girls and boys who are teased about 
their weight compared with those 
who are not teased about their 
weight.‍63, 
 
64
Social isolation and academic 
outcomes
Weight-based teasing and bullying 
also contribute to social isolation 
and adverse academic outcomes for 
youth.‍ Evidence from the National 
Longitudinal Study of Adolescent 
Health demonstrated that compared 
with students without overweight, 
adolescents with overweight or 
obesity are significantly more likely 
to experience social isolation and 
are less likely to be nominated as 
friends by peers.‍65, 
 
66 Youth are 
keenly aware at an early age that 
their weight status may affect their 
social relationships; 1 study found 
that more than two-thirds of 9- to 
11-year-old children who perceived 
themselves as having excess weight 
believed they would have more 
friends if they could lose weight.‍37 
Teasing that impairs social bonds 
may have an additional negative 
effect on academic performance.‍ 
Weight-based teasing has been 
found to mediate the relationship 
between students’ higher BMI and 
poorer school performance67 and 
may lead students to disengage 
from their school environment.‍ In 
a recent study, adolescents who 
reported experiencing weight-based 
bullying during the previous year 
indicated that their grades were 
harmed by these experiences, and 
they avoided going to school to

 escape weight-based teasing and 
bullying.‍68 The likelihood of students 
reporting these reactions increased 
by 5% per teasing incident even after 
accounting for sex, race, age, grades, 
and weight status.‍
unhealthy Eating Behaviors
Weight-based victimization may 
reinforce unhealthy eating behaviors 
that contribute to increased body 
weight.‍ Among boys and girls 
enrolled in weight-loss camps, 
those who reported weight-based 
teasing were more likely to engage 
in unhealthy eating behaviors and 
binge eating than were peers who 
were not teased.‍69, 
 
70 Prospective 
research has demonstrated 
longitudinal associations between 
early experiences of weight-based 
teasing and later disordered eating 
behaviors.‍71 Other work has found 
links between weight-based teasing 
and disordered eating for both 
adolescent boys and girls across 
weight strata.‍65 Among Hispanic 
and African American girls, weight-
based teasing from peers and 
parents was associated with more 
emotional eating and binge eating.‍72 
Retrospective research with young 
adult women has additionally 
demonstrated that those who 
experienced weight-based teasing in 
childhood are more likely to engage 
in unhealthy eating behaviors than 
peers who were not teased, and as 
the variety of weight-based teasing 
insults increased in childhood, so 
did the disordered eating patterns 
and current body weight status in 
adulthood.‍67
decreased Exercise and physical 
activity
Experiences of weight-based 
teasing and bullying have negative 
implications for exercise motivation 
and physical activity.‍ Youth who 
experience more frequent weight-
based teasing have decreased levels 
of physical activity.‍73, 
 
74 Middle 
school students who report being 
teased about their weight have less 
self-confidence in being physically 
active and lower levels of physical 
fitness compared with peers who are 
not teased even after controlling for 
sociodemographic characteristics.‍75 
Furthermore, adolescents who report 
more emotional distress in response 
to experiences of weight-based 
teasing are more likely to cope with 
teasing by avoiding school activities, 
including physical activities and 
going to physical education class.‍70 
These findings raise additional 
concerns in light of recent research 
showing that as many as 85% of high 
school students report witnessing 
weight-based teasing toward their 
peers during gym class at school.‍19
Worsening obesity
Emerging research has demonstrated 
associations between weight-based 
teasing and increased body weight 
status in youth.‍ One study found that 
compared with girls who did not 
experience weight stigmatization, 
girls reporting previous experiences 
of weight stigmatization had a 64% 
to 66% increased risk of developing 
and/or worsening overweight or 
obesity.‍76, 
 
77 During adolescence, 
teasing and hurtful weight labels 
from family members may be 
especially harmful; evidence from 
a diverse sample of girls found 
greater odds of obesity as a result of 
stigmatization from family members 
than from friends and teachers.‍78 
Recent longitudinal evidence 
additionally shows that weight-based 
teasing experienced by girls and boys 
in adolescence predicts higher BMI 
and obesity for both women and men 
15 years later.‍79 In addition, several 
recent longitudinal studies of adults 
have found that perceived weight 
stigma and discrimination increase 
the risk of developing and continuing 
to have obesity over time even after 
controlling for baseline BMI, sex, 
race, and socioeconomic factors.‍80, 
 
81  
Furthermore, emerging research 
reports that perceived pressure to be 
thin in adolescence is associated with 
a greater elevation of fasting insulin 
and poorer insulin sensitivity.‍ The 
negative effect of emotional pressure 
on hyperinsulinemia was sustained 
even after controlling for fat mass 
and adiposity.‍82 Taken together, 
these findings raise significant 
concerns about the effects of weight 
stigma on health behaviors and 
outcomes of vulnerable youth.‍
RECommEndaTionS
improving Clinical practice
The American Academy of Pediatrics 
recommends that pediatricians 
engage in efforts to mitigate weight 
stigmatization at the practice 
level and beyond.‍ The following 
recommendations offer practice-level 
strategies for pediatricians.‍
1.‍ Role Modeling.‍ It is important for 
pediatricians and pediatric health 
care professionals to demonstrate 
and model professional behavior 
with colleagues, staff, and trainees 
that is supportive and nonbiased 
toward children and families 
with obesity.‍ These efforts should 
include the recognition and 
acknowledgment of the complex 
etiology of obesity, including 
genetic and socioeconomic factors, 
environmental contributors, 
community assets, family and 
cultural traditions, and individual 
choices.‍ This recognition can help 
dispel common assumptions and 
stereotypes that place blame and 
judgment solely on individuals 
for having excess weight or 
difficulties achieving weight loss.‍
2.‍ Language and Word Choice.‍ It is 
important for pediatricians and 
pediatric health care professionals 
to use appropriate, sensitive, 
and nonstigmatizing language 
in communication about weight 
with youth, families, and other 
members of the pediatric 
health care team.‍ Words can 
heal or harm, intentionally and 
unintentionally.‍ Recent evidence 
PEDIATRICS Volume 140, number 6, December 2017

Downloaded from 
 shows that neutral words like 
“weight” and “body mass index” 
are preferred by adolescents  
with overweight and obesity,  
whereas terms like “obese, 
”  
“extremely obese, 
” “fat, 
” or 
“weight problem” induce feelings 
of sadness, embarrassment, and 
shame if parents use these words 
to describe their children’s body 
weight.‍83, 
 
84 Furthermore, using 
people-first language is one 
step to help reduce the use of 
potentially stigmatizing language, 
and it is now emerging as the 
preferred standard with obesity 
as well as other diseases and 
disabilities.‍ People-first language 
places the individual first before 
the medical condition or disability 
and involves using phrases such as 
“a child with obesity” rather than 
an “obese child.‍”
3.‍ Clinical Documentation.‍ Obesity 
is a medical diagnosis with 
real health consequences, so it 
is important for children and 
families to understand the current 
and future health risks associated 
with the degree to which a patient 
weighs more than what is healthy.‍ 
However, this should be addressed 
with a balanced and empathetic 
approach so that the information 
is conveyed and understood in a 
sensitive and supportive manner.‍ 
Using more neutral terms, such 
as “unhealthy weight and “very 
unhealthy weight, 
” both in clinical 
notes and when speaking to 
patients and family members can 
assist in these efforts.‍ Electronic 
health records and medical coding 
nomenclature could consider 
using the terms “unhealthy 
weight” and “very unhealthy 
weight” instead of “obesity” and 
“morbid obesity” in problem 
lists to further support the use of 
patient-sensitive language during 
clinical encounters.‍
4.‍ Behavior Change Counseling.‍ 
Beyond specific word choice, 
it is recommended that 
patient-centered, empathetic 
behavior change approaches, such 
as motivational interviewing, be 
used as a framework to support 
patients and families in making 
healthy changes.‍85 
– 
87 Through 
motivational interviewing, health 
care professionals collaboratively 
engage the patient and/or parents 
in determining their goals and 
addressing barriers to how they 
will achieve sustained health 
behavior change.‍
5.‍ Clinical Environment.‍ 
Pediatricians should create a safe, 
welcoming, and nonstigmatizing 
clinic space for youth with obesity 
and their families.‍ This requires 
creating a supportive practice 
setting that accommodates 
patients of diverse body sizes, 
from the clinic entrance to  
the examination room (see 
Appendix 1).‍
6.‍ Behavioral Health Screening.‍ 
Addressing weight stigma in 
clinical practice also necessitates 
that pediatricians assess patients 
not only for physical but also 
emotional comorbidities and 
negative exposures associated

advocating against Weight Stigma
Creating a healthy environment 
in which patients live is critical to 
effectively address and prevent 
obesity.‍ As part of these efforts, 
it is important to promote an 
environment that supports and 
empowers youth and families to 
be healthy rather than reinforcing 
societal shame or stigma directed 
toward those with obesity.‍ Thus, 
pediatricians can be important 
advocates to reduce weight stigma in 
multiple settings.‍
1.‍ Schools.‍ Pediatricians can 
work with schools to ensure 
antibullying policies include 
protections for students who are 
bullied about their weight.‍ Given 
that weight-based bullying is 
often absent in school policies, 
advocacy efforts by health care 
professionals could play an 
important role in reducing such 
bullying.‍
2.‍ Youth-Targeted Media.‍ It is 
important that pediatricians 
and pediatric health care 
professionals advocate for a 
responsible and respectful 
portrayal of individuals with 
obesity in the media.‍ By 
speaking out (eg, opinions and 
commentaries, letters to editors, 
professional presentations, or 
commenting on social media) 
against stigmatizing depictions 
in the media, pediatric health 
care professionals can help 
increase the awareness of weight 
stigma that can be particularly 
damaging to children and can 
reinforce broader societal 
stigma.‍
3.‍ Provider Training.‍ It is 
important for pediatricians 
and professional entities to 
continue to advocate for the 
inclusion of training to address 
weight stigma in medical school 
and residency curricula and 
through ongoing continuing 
medical education programs for 
practicing physicians; and
4.‍ Parents.‍ It is important for 
pediatricians and pediatric health 
care professionals to work to 
empower families and patients 
to manage and address weight 
stigma in schools, communities, 
and their homes.‍ Pediatricians 
can encourage parents of patients 
to actively inquire with their 
children’s teachers and school 
administrative staff to ensure 
that plans are in place to address 
weight-based victimization 
in their institutions.‍ Parents

 should also be asked to consider 
potential weight stigma at home, 
of which friends and family 
members can be sources.‍ Finally, 
because the rates of obesity are 
higher in communities that are 
socioeconomically challenged 
and in communities of color, 
additional stigma attributable 
to race, socioeconomics, and 
sex could further compound the 
weight stigma experienced by 
some individuals, families, and 
communities.‍91
ConCluSionS
Obesity is a challenging disease 
to treat.‍ Many factors are at play, 
and many of these factors are 
difficult to effectively address 
during a short office encounter.‍ 
The challenges health care 
professionals may face regarding 
obesity can affect interactions 
with patients and unintentionally 
communicate stigma, blame, or 
judgment when attempting to 
increase patient motivation for 
change.‍ Unfortunately, evidence 
shows these approaches likely 
impair rather than improve health 
behaviors and weight outcomes.‍ 
In addition, the emotional distress 
experienced by patients who 
feel stigmatized can reduce the 
likelihood of returning for future 
health care visits.‍
Supportive health care, community, 
and educational environments can 
be sources of strength for patients; 
however, at present, many of 
these environments contribute to 
rather than correct and address 
damaging weight stigma.‍ Thus, 
pediatric health care professionals 
can play an important role in efforts 
to address the stigmatization of 
people with obesity and increase 
the awareness that stigmatizing 
obesity does not reduce obesity or 
improve healthful behaviors.‍ By 
examining their own weight biases, 
modeling sensitive communication 
and behavior to children and 
families with obesity, and taking 
steps to address weight stigma 
with their staff, in their clinic 
environments, and in the broader 
communities, pediatric health care 
professionals can make important 
shifts in the culture of care for 
children with obesity.‍ With these 
concerted efforts to reduce weight 
stigma, interventions can more 
effectively help and empower 
patients to improve their weight-
related health.‍

1.‍ A first step in addressing weight 
stigma is to become aware of 
one’s own potential attitudes and 
assumptions about body weight.‍ 
The University of Connecticut's 
Rudd Center for Food Policy and 
Obesity has several evidence-
based resources on weight stigma 
to help health care professionals 
raise self-awareness of personal 
attitudes about obesity, learn 
how weight stigma can affect 
patient care, and take actionable 
steps for personal, clinical, and 
community change.‍ Resources 
include educational videos and a 
free, online continuing medical 
education course (http:// 
ruddcentercme.‍ 
org).‍
2.‍ The American Academy of 
Pediatrics Institute for Healthy 
Childhood Weight developed 
the free “ChangeTalk: Childhood 
Obesity” online resource (https:// 
go.‍ 
kognito.‍ 
com/ 
changetalk) for 
providers to learn and practice 
motivational interviewing skills 
with interactive avatars and 
clinical encounters with a patient 
and parent challenged by obesity.‍
3.‍ When assessing for a sensitive 
clinical environment, ask the 
following types of questions to 
help identify potential aspects of 
the clinical office environment 
in which steps can be taken 
to address weight stigma.‍ Are 
the chairs in the waiting room 
able to support the weight of a 
patient or parent of high body 
weight? Do the chairs have arm 
rests that might prevent a larger 
parent or patient from being able 
to comfortably sit down? Are 
available reading materials for 
patients supportive of healthy 
lifestyle changes, or do they 
inadvertently promote unhealthy 
body images and fad diets? When 
a patient is brought back to 
PEDIATRICS Volume 140, number 6, December 2017

Downloaded from 
 the clinic room, is the scale in a 
private area, and can it accurately 
weigh a larger patient? Are there 
blood pressure cuffs that will 
accommodate and provide an 
accurate reading on a larger arm? 
Are there gowns that will allow 
larger patients to feel comfortable 
and not overly exposed when they 
change?
4.‍ The Obesity Action Coalition, 
The Obesity Society, and the 
Rudd Center for Food Policy and 
Obesity published guidelines for 
the portrayal of individuals with 
obesity in the media (http://

These guidelines include the 
following sections: (1) Respect 
Diversity and Avoid Stereotypes; 
(2) Appropriate Language and 
Terminology; (3) Balanced and 
Accurate Coverage of Obesity; 
and (4) Appropriate Pictures 
and Images of Individuals 
Affected by Obesity.‍ Following 
guidelines like these in health 
communication about obesity 
can help ensure that messages 
about obesity are respectful 
and supportive of people with 
obesity rather than contributing 
to societal stigma.‍
