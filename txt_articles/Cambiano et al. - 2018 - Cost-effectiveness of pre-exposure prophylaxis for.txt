 ABSTRACT  
 
Background: In the UK, HIV incidence among men having sex with men (MSM) remains high despite 
the widespread use of antiretroviral therapy and high rates of virological suppression. Pre-Exposure 
Prophylaxis (PrEP) has been shown to be highly effective in preventing further infections in MSM, 
but its cost-effectiveness is less certain. 
 
Methods: A dynamic, individual-based stochastic model, the Synthesis model, was calibrated to 
multiple data sources on HIV among UK MSM. We evaluated the introduction of a PrEP programme 
with sexual event-based use of Emtricitabine/Tenofovir for MSM who had condomless anal 
intercourse in the previous three months, a negative HIV test at baseline, and a negative HIV test in 
the preceding year (similar to the eligibility criteria in the PROUD study). 
 
Findings: The introduction of such a PrEP programme with around 4,000 MSM initiated on PrEP by 
the end of the 1st year and almost 40,000 by the end of the 15th year resulted in a total cost saving 
(£1·0 billion discounted) and led to a gain of 40,000 discounted quality adjusted life-years over an 
eighty-year time horizon. This result was particularly sensitive to the time horizon chosen, the cost 
of antiretrovirals (for treatment and PrEP), and the underlying trend in condomless sex.  
 
Interpretation: This analysis suggests that the introduction of a PrEP programme for MSM in the UK 
could be cost-saving and produce better health outcomes over the long term. However, a reduction 
in the cost of antiretrovirals (including the drugs used for PrEP) significantly shortens the time for 
cost-effectiveness to be achieved.

 Research in context 
 
Evidence before this study 
 
Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) has been shown to be highly efficacious and effective. However, 
PrEP drugs are currently expensive in high income settings and the cost-effectiveness of offering 
PrEP as part of universal health care systems in such settings is unclear.  
 
We searched PubMed for English-language studies published up to May 31, 2017, that estimated the 
cost-effectiveness of PrEP programmes, taking into account of onward transmission. We combined 
search terms for PrEP (“pre-exposure prophylaxis”, “preexposure prophylaxis” “PREP” “HIV”) with 
health economic terms (“cost”, “cost-effectiveness”, “cost effectiveness”, “ICER”, “cost-benefit”, 
“cost benefit”,  “cost-utility”, “cost utility”, “health economics”, “economics”, “economic 
evaluation”) and “transmission”.  
 
We found one report of cost-effectiveness analyses of PrEP programme among men having sex with 
men (MSM) in Europe: in the Netherland1. Using a deterministic compartmental model calibrated to 
the Netherlands, they concluded that the introduction of event-based PrEP in MSM in the 
Netherland would be cost-effective at the current cost of Emtricitabine/Tenofovir over a 40 year 
time horizon. 
 
Added value of this study 
 
The PROUD and IPERGAY trials demonstrated that PrEP is highly efficacious and effective among 
MSM. We used the effectiveness estimated in PROUD to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a 
programme that will be delivered in the same population from which participants in the PROUD trial 
were recruited, using similar eligibility criteria and assuming it will be delivered through the same 
system (Genito Urinary Medicine clinics). 
Our study suggests a PrEP programme with (sex) event-based use of Emtricitabine/Tenofovir being 
offered to MSM who had condomless anal intercourse in the previous three months, a negative HIV 
test at baseline, and a negative HIV test in the preceding year (similar to the eligibility criteria in the 
PROUD study) results in a saving in cost and a health benefit when considering an appropriately long 
time horizon (eighty years).  The patent protection on drugs used for PrEP expires in Europe in 2017 -
2018 (a supplementary protection certificate for Truvada expires in February 2020)2, if the cost of 
antiretroviral drugs (used for PrEP and treatment) are reduced from 2019 by 80%, the introduction 
of such a PrEP programme is cost-effective even when considering a twenty year time horizon. 
 
Implications of all the available evidence 
 
There is no doubt of the effectiveness of PrEP. Our work suggests that the introduction of PrEP will – 
in addition to delivering a substantial health benefit - ultimately lead to a saving in cost, due to the 
lower number of men in need of lifelong HIV treatment. As antiretroviral patents expire over the 
next few years, potentially large cost reductions in the drugs used for PrEP with the emergence of 
generics may occur and this would help to limit the budget impact of PrEP and make it cost-effective  
over a relatively short time horizon. 
 
 INTRODUCTION 
 
Sex between men is the predominant mode of HIV transmission in Europe and other high income 
settings.3 In the UK, HIV incidence among men having sex with men (MSM) has remained high (around 
3,000 new HIV infections in 20144 and 20155,6, although with reports of somewhat lower levels in 
20167), despite high levels of antiretroviral treatment (ART) coverage, virological suppression for those 
on treatment and an expansion in HIV testing.8,9 Alternative prevention approaches are needed, of 
which a promising option is Emtricitabine/Tenofovir-based Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP). This 
involves HIV negative people taking the drug combination to reduce the risk of HIV infection. PrEP has 
been demonstrated to be highly efficacious among MSM, whether used daily10 or event-based (i.e. 
two pills 2-24 hours before a sex act, one for each consecutive day having condomless sex, for two 
days after the last sex act),11 and effective in real world conditions when used daily.12  
 
However, when considering a PrEP programme in the UK for MSM, important questions are whether 
it is cost-effective from a health system (i.e. the National Health Service (NHS)) perspective and its 
budgetary impact. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of introducing 
event-based PrEP among MSM attending Genito-Urinary Medicine (GUM) clinics in the UK in 2016. 
The choice of offering a sexual event-based PrEP regimen, rather than daily was driven by the high 
efficacy reported in the IPERGAY study11 and the lower cost compared with daily regimen. In the UK, 
there is a network of around 200 GUM clinics, who offer sexual health advice, testing, treatment for 
sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) free and confidentially to 
anybody. This is envisaged to be the most pragmatic way of offering PrEP in the UK. 
 
METHODS 
 
A dynamic individual-based simulation model (the HIV Synthesis Model), calibrated to the MSM HIV 
epidemic in the UK that has previously described in detail,5,8 was used to address this question (see 
Appendix I for a brief description, page 1, Appendix II for details on the calibration, page 18-48 and 
Appendix III for full details, page 50). A probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) was conducted to 
produce the main results, by sampling twenty-two key parameters (see Appendix I page 1 for the list 
of parameters sampled). 5965 simulations were performed. To reduce the stochastic variability 
when presenting the main results, we divided each of these parameter distributions into tertiles and 
calculated the mean across simulations with the same combination of parameter tertiles. When 
estimating the health benefit we considered the combination of parameters affecting the HIV 
infections averted (5); while when estimating the incremental cost we considered the combination 
across all the parameters sampled in the PSA (22). The univariate sensitivity analyses were 
conducted by fixing the parameters that were sampled in the PSA. 
 
PrEP policy options compared and main assumptions relating to PrEP 
 
Two main scenarios were compared: one in which PrEP is not available and the other assuming that 
sexual event-based PrEP is introduced (the proportion of pills taken is sampled; the mean 
corresponds to 5 pills/week) in the second quarter of 2016. In both scenarios sexual behaviour, HIV 
testing behaviour, and the probability of initiating ART are assumed to remain at current levels. In 
the PrEP scenario, it was assumed that MSM were eligible for PrEP if: (a) they had a negative HIV test 
at PrEP initiation (b) they had reported condomless anal intercourse in the previous three months 
(unless the only partner they had condomless sex with was a long-term partner virologically 
suppressed on ART13), and (c) they had had an additional documented negative HIV test in the 
preceding year, very similarly to the PROUD study eligibility criteria.12  
The current national number of men eligible for PrEP, based on the above criteria, has been 
estimated to be between 8,400 and 12,200 (See Appendix I, page 2). This group is characterised (in 
 the model) by an HIV incidence of around 2·0/100 person-years (90% range:0·7-4·3/100 person-
years) in 2016, similar to the HIV incidence observed in repeat testers in GUM clinics.14  
 
Once PrEP has been started, it is assumed sexual event-based PrEP will be used in any subsequent 
three month period when having condomless sex (unless the only condomless sex partner is a long 
term partner who is virologically suppressed on ART) unless there is a decision to interrupt it (mean 
rate of interruption of 0.1 per year, with wide variability considered, see Appendix IV page 128).  
However, mens can restart PrEP with a mean rate of 0.5 per year (similarly a wide variability is 
considered – see Appendix IV, page 128) if having condomless sex again. It is assumed that the PrEP 
programme will be stopped if the overall HIV incidence in the MSM population drops below 1/1000 
(i.e. approximately a fivefold decline compared to current HIV incidence).  
 
We assume that men on PrEP test for HIV every three months, as recommended by the British 
Association for Sexual Health and HIV for MSM having condomless sex15 (and the US Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention for people on PrEP16). In the eventuality that a person becomes HIV 
positive they would be diagnosed with HIV at the next test and PrEP would be stopped.  
 
The effectiveness of PrEP (sampled in the PSA) was assumed to be on average 86%12, reflecting both 
adherence and efficacy (the protection conferred when taken as prescribed).  
 
Outcomes and Economic analysis 
 
The main model outcomes are the number of HIV infections, quality adjusted life-years (QALYs), and 
costs. In addition to the PSA, a range of univariate sensitivity analyses were performed as outlined in 
the Appendix I (page 3-6) to investigate the impact of changes in key assumptions. 
 
The utilities used to calculate the QALYs are age-adjusted and take into account the reduced quality  
of life of people diagnosed with HIV in different stages of infection (sampled in the PSA, see 
Supplementary Table 1 on page 7 of the Appendix I). The cost (per year) of the antiretroviral drugs 
for treatment is assumed to be £6,28817, while the mean cost (per year) of antiretrovirals for PrEP is 
£4,331 18. The unit costs assumed (sampled in the PSA) are summarized in Supplementary Table 2 
(page 8-10 of the Appendix I) and are assumed to remain at the current level for the entire time 
horizon, although discounting applies. In the base case, all costs and QALYs are discounted at an 
annual rate of 3·5%.19 A time horizon of eighty years is used, given the National Institute of Health 
and Care Excellence recommendations considering a lifetime horizon.19

RESULTS 
 
Current situation and PrEP scale up 
 
In 2016, the year in which it is assumed PrEP roll-out would have started, the number of MSM living 
in the UK is estimated to be 725,200 (585,000 aged 15-64); 57,800 (53,900 aged 15-64) are 
estimated to be living with HIV and, with around 3,500 new HIV infections that year, the HIV 
incidence rate is estimated to be around 6/1,000 person-years in MSM aged 15-64. We considered a 
PrEP programme where the uptake was such that on average around 4,000 MSM initiate PrEP by the 
end of the 1st year, and that by the end of the fifth (2020) and 15th years (2030) respectively 16,600 
 and 38,900 would have ever been initiated on PrEP respectively (See Figure 1a). This is considered to 
reflect a realistic gradual uptake. The mean time spent on PrEP among men initiated on PrEP is four 
and half years.  
  
Epidemiological impact 
 
Without the introduction of PrEP, HIV incidence is projected to decline due to the offer of earlier 
ART initiation and because of an increase in the number of MSM who become aware of their HIV 
status, induced by continuing HIV testing at the current rate. By introducing a PrEP programme as 
described above, over the next 80 years, 25% of the HIV infections among MSM living in the UK are 
predicted to be averted (with the specified distribution for the size of the PrEP programme; see 
Figure 1b and Table 1), 42% of which are directly due to people receiving PrEP and the remainder 
due to the prevention of onward transmission. As a consequence, PrEP would result in a gain of 
220,000 quality adjusted life-years (QALYs - 40,000 with discounting) (see Table 1), corresponding to 
5 QALYs gained per infection averted.  
 
Economic impact 
 
The introduction of event-based PrEP, by averting HIV infections (see Figure 1b and Figure1c), 
reduces the cumulative HIV cost (see Table 1). While the number of people living with HIV in care is 
projected to start declining in the mid 2050s, even if PrEP is not introduced, this would happen 
around ten years earlier if PrEP is introduced (See Figure 1d).  
 
Figure 3 shows the undiscounted budget impact for HIV care and prevention (PrEP and PEP are 
included) over the next eighty years respectively without the introduction of PrEP, with the 
introduction of PrEP, and their difference. The same is presented assuming the cost of antiretrovirals 
(for PrEP and treatment) is reduced by 50% from 2019. In 2016, if PrEP is not introduced, 94% of the 
HIV budget is estimated to be spent on the cost of antiretroviral drugs to treat people with HIV 
(44%) and health care services for providing ART and treating clinical diseases (50%). The budget for 
HIV care, treatment, HIV testing and PEP for MSM in 2016 is estimated to increase from around 
£0·45 billion to reach its peak of around £0·85 billion in thirty years (See Figure 3a). With the 
introduction of PrEP (see Figure 3b), this peak is projected to happen ten years earlier, in around 
twenty years.  
 
Cost-effectiveness evaluation 
 
The introduction of event-based PrEP leads to an additional 40,000 discounted QALYs over an eighty-
year time horizon and a saving in costs (£1·0 billion discounted). Thus, over the eighty-year time 
horizon PrEP introduction is cost saving, so highly cost effective. The cost-effectiveness plane (Figure 
2a) illustrates the uncertainty around our findings and the cost-effectiveness acceptability curve the 
fact that the probability of a PREP programme being cost-effective is above 80% when considering a 
cost-effectiveness threshold greater than £20,000 per QALY gained (Figure 2b, around 75% at 
£13,000 per QALY gained). 
 
We performed several one-way sensitivity analyses, summarized in Table 2 and described in the 
Appendix I (page 3). In all sensitivity analyses related to costs (Table 2; S1-S9), including assuming 
the cost of daily PrEP rather than event-based, we found that over an eighty-year time horizon the 
introduction of PrEP, as indicated, generates additional QALYs and is cost-saving. 
 
A number of other sensitivity analyses were considered including: an effectiveness of 63% (the 90% 
lower confidence limit in PROUD12) (S10), assuming PrEP is used only in half of the three month 
 periods when having condomless sex (S11) and assuming the proportion of three month periods in 
which men initiated on PrEP have at least one condomless sex partner increased by 25% (S12). Our 
findings were robust to these variations and PrEP was still cost-saving and generated additional 
QALYs. However, if men who started PrEP only used it in 50% of three-month periods when having 
at least one condomless sex partner, both the health benefit (23,000 rather than 36,000 discounted 
additional QALYs) and the saving in cost (£673 million rather than £964 million) were considerably 
lower (S11).  
 
Three other sensitivity analyses considered different sizes of the PrEP programme either due to a 
lower (S13) or higher (S14) uptake in the eligible population or by assuming that the eligible 
population increases due to an assumed 15% of men who tested in the last year and who are having 
condomless sex coming forward for PrEP (S15). PrEP is cost saving in these scenarios - the greater 
the size of the PrEP programme the larger the health benefit and the saving in cost.  
 
 
In the context of higher background HIV incidence (Table 2;S16, S17; See also Supplementary Figure 
1h -1m at page 14-17 of the Appendix I), the cost-effectiveness of introducing PrEP was even higher 
with more quality adjusted life-years gained and a greater saving in cost. On the other hand, if the 
HIV incidence is lower due to all people diagnosed with HIV starting treatment at diagnosis (S20), the 
introduction of PrEP is still cost-saving, but the cost saving is slightly lower. If the uptake of PrEP is 
concentrated in those at higher risk of contracting HIV (S19) the health benefit is slightly lower 
compared to the base case due to the fact that the size of the PREP programme is smaller (see 
Supplementary Figure 1b) but the saving in cost is even greater due to the fact it is a more efficient 
way of implementing PrEP. Finally, we considered the cost-effectiveness of PrEP in the context of the 
PrEP programme continuing, regardless of the HIV incidence in the MSM population (S18) and in the 
context of MSM initiated on PrEP increasing on average by 25% the proportion of three-month 
periods they have at least one condomless sex partner (S12) and having at least one condomless sex 
partner for life (S21). Even in these scenarios the introduction of PrEP was cost-effective. The reason 
why we observe a greater health benefit if people initiated on PrEP increase their condomless sex 
and use PrEP is that the greater the number of men using PrEP, the fewer the number of 
partnerships which are not protected by PrEP. In other words those men who stay on PrEP longer 
and continue having condomless sex are effectively protected from HIV when they have condomless 
sex partnerships, while if they had not started PrEP they would have a lifetime risk of contracting 
HIV. 
 
Table 3 shows how the cost-effectiveness of introducing PrEP varies according to different time 
horizons and different reductions in the cost of antiretrovirals. This is done both in the base case 
scenario, where HIV incidence is predicted to drop even in the absence of PrEP, and in the context of 
the HIV incidence increasing due to a moderate increase in sexual risk(See Supplementary Figure 1h 
-1m at page 14-17 of the Appendix I).  
At the current cost of antiretrovirals, the introduction of event-based PrEP becomes cost-effective 
when considering a time horizon of forty years or more. However, as the cost of antiretrovirals 
decreases the time horizon for the introduction of PREP to be cost-effective shortens. For example, 
when considering an 80% reduction in the cost of antiretrovirals (for both PrEP and treatment) from 
2019, PrEP would be cost-effective even when considering a 20 year time horizon (£6,000/QALY 
gained) and cost-saving over this time horizon in the scenario where the HIV incidence is increasing. 
 
Finally, we estimated the maximum cost to treat an STI at which the introduction of PrEP is still cost-
effective, assuming a substantial increase in STIs. In 2014, 48,000 new STIs diagnoses were reported 
among MSM in the UK.20 If there were to be 96,000 new STIs diagnoses per year following the 
introduction of PrEP, its introduction would still be cost saving if the average cost to treat an STI is 
£2,000 or less. 
  
DISCUSSION 
 
Our results suggest that the introduction of event-based PrEP among MSM in the UK with the 
eligibility criteria proposed is cost-saving, leading to a health benefit due to a substantial reduction 
in HIV incidence among MSM and a saving in cost. Our results are robust to considerable variations 
in the main assumptions. While PrEP introduction is cost saving taking an appropriately long time 
horizon, there are increases in overall costs for 20 years in our main results and it takes 40 years for 
the incremental cost effectiveness ratio to be below £13,000.   
 
The uptake of PrEP among the population eligible for PrEP, and hence the size of the PrEP 
programme, is a crucial parameter for the budget impact of such a programme. A number of surveys 
conducted in the UK among HIV negative MSM reported that between 55%21 (among men who 
reported sex without using condom in the past 3 months and who tested negative within the last six 
months) and 60%22 were interested in PrEP, 50%23 were willing to use it if available and 2% had 
already used it.23 We found that the greater the size of the PrEP programme among men eligible the 
greater the health benefit. The saving in cost (we considered a maximum PrEP programme of 27,000 
men at its peak) depends not only on the size but also on the risk of HIV acquisition in people 
receiving PrEP. In addition, the size of the PrEP programme will depend on whether men come 
forward for PrEP as it becomes available. Unfortunately, it is not possible yet to estimate this 
parameter with any degree of certainty. In the context of a larger PrEP programme, due to greater 
numbers of men having condomless sex and a previous HIV test in the last year presenting for PrEP, 
the introduction of PrEP plays an even more significant role in preventing HIV infections and is more 
cost-effective. 
 
In the main case it is assumed that HIV testing will continue at the current rate, as it is standard in 
health economic analysis to assume the current situation will persist. However, testing rates have 
rapidly increased in the UK in the recent years, especially in some clinics and in combination with the 
offer of treatment at diagnosis (and to some extent the possibility of buying PrEP online) and a 
reduction in the number of new diagnoses has been observed in these clinics. Within our Synthesis 
model we do predict a drop in HIV incidence as the proportion of people with HIV who are on ART 
increased due to increased testing and ART initiation at diagnosis 5 and it is believed the observed 
drop in the number of new diagnoses is the result of a combination of interventions.  
 
Within the PROUD trial, which was open-label, no significant difference was found at one year in the 
number of different anal sex partners or in the proportion diagnosed with an STI, although there was 
a significant increase in the number reporting receptive anal sex without a condom12. We 
investigated the impact of men starting PrEP increasing by 25% the proportion of three-month 
periods in which they have at least one condomless sex partner and having at least one  condomless 
sex partner in all subsequent three month periods and this did not affect our main conclusions. 
 
Despite the strength of evidence, one of the residual concerns regarding the introduction of PrEP is 
the potential spread of other STIs (including HCV) and the cost of their treatment. In our model the 
transmission of STIs and its treatment are not explicitly modelled. However, we found that if the 
annual number of STIs diagnosed doubled (compared to 2014) due to the introduction of PrEP, its 
introduction would still be cost saving if the average cost to treat an STI is £2,000 or less.  
 
The exact unit costs the NHS pays for HIV drug treatment is confidential and it is uncertain by how 
much the cost of antiretroviral drugs will drop once the patent of the antiretrovirals expire. 
However, we can be confident that the cost of Emtricitabine/Tenofovir will decrease in the next 20 
years, but there is more uncertainty over reductions in the cost for other antiretrovirals used for 
 treatment. In this regard we believe we have been conservative in using the cost of treatment from 
a Freedom of Information request (likely to be close to the actual cost for the NHS) and the cost of 
Truvada® for PREP from the British National Formulary (as this is not available in the FOI) and in 
assuming that the cost of Emtricitabine/Tenofovir and the cost of antiretrovirals used for treatment 
will decline by the same amount. These costs play a key role: the greater the reduction, the shorter 
the time horizon for PrEP to be cost-effective and cost-saving. 
 
Cost-effectiveness analyses of PrEP introduction among MSM in other high-income settings have 
been conducted, including in the US,24-27 Australia,28 Canada,29 and the Netherlands.1 Most, but not 
all27,29 were conducted before the PROUD and IPERGAY trials reported and had therefore assumed a 
lower efficacy of PrEP than we now consider to be the case, and most considered a shorter time 
horizon.  The cost-effectiveness evaluation conducted in the context of the Netherlands1 considered 
a time horizon of 40 years and concluded that the introduction of event-based PrEP in MSM in the 
Netherland would be cost-effective at the current cost of Emtricitabine/Tenofovir, consistent with 
our findings for the UK.  
 
Our study has several limitations. First, as with all mathematical models, the Synthesis Model is a 
simplification of the reality and the uncertainty around our estimate is illustrated by considering 
variation in the main assumptions. Second, the model estimates that around 80% of new HIV 
infections among MSM in the UK come from men unaware of their HIV status. Part of the population 
unaware of their HIV positive status is a subgroup of people who are resistant to testing. However, if 
people who are unaware of their status are characterized by a higher level of condomless sex, the 
impact of PrEP could be even greater. Third, there is uncertainty over the parameter distributions to 
be used for the PSA, but we believe that we have been conservative by choosing broad distributions, 
which means we could have conveyed more uncertainty than there actually is. Forth, the population 
simulated by the model, because of computer capacity, is 1/15 of the UK MSM population and this 
increases the stochastic variability of our results. To tackle this issue we have presented the mean 
across simulations with the same combination of parameter tertiles. However, we cannot exclude 
that the variability reported is greater than the variability due to the uncertainty in the parameters 
and the stochastic variability if we had modelled the whole UK MSM population. 
In conclusion, our analysis has shown that the introduction of PrEP in the proposed eligible 
population is cost-saving. However, commissioners will have to sustain an additional cost for the first 
twenty years, unless drug prices substantially reduce.

 Table 2. Sensitivity analyses. Difference in discounted QALYs and discounted cost* over eighty-year time horizon for MSM in the UK by potential 
implementation of PrEP with current cost of ARVs and with an 80% reduction from 2019.  
The reduction in cost of ARVs refers to ARVs used for treatment and as PrEP and the reduction is from 2019 (the year after Emtricitabine/Tenofovir patent 
expires in Europe), reflecting the potential reduction due to price discounts and use of generic drugs (See section “Sensitivity analyses” in the Appendix for 
detailed description).

ARVs: antiretrovirals; ART: antiretroviral therapy; BNF: British National Formulary; CLS: condomless sex; ICER: incremental cost-effectiveness ratio; MSM: men having sex with men; NC: not calculated, as the result 
will be the same as other sensitivity analyses in the table; PrEP: Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis; QALYs: quality adjusted life-years; 
*compared to the scenario without PrEP; **See Supplementary Table 2 at page 7 of the Appendix;***from 2019;^ the probability per 3 months of starting PrEP if the CD4 is above 350 cells/mm3 is 0·025, rather than 
0·15 per 3 month. ^^The comparator to calculate QALYs averted, difference in cost and ICER is the same scenario but without the introduction of PrEP;****The assumption of a cost of £4,008 for 365 pills rather 
than £4,331, as reported in the BNF 2015, was considered because the average cost for one year of antiretroviral treatment per person in London is £4,741 (Source: Freedom of Information Request). Most regimen 
would contain Truvada, so given the cheapest cost of the third agent is Lamivudine which is available as generic at a cost of £733 we wanted to consider the maximum cost of Truvada being 4,008 (£4,741-£733)   
 cost-saving (leading to a health benefit and saving in cost);  cost-effective (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio [ICER] below £13,000/QALY gained);
