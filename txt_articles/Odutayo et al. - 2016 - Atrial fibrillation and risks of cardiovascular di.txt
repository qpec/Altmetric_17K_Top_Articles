ABSTRACT
ObjeCtive
To quantify the association between atrial fibrillation 
and cardiovascular disease, renal disease, and death.
Design
Systematic review and meta-analysis.
Data sOurCes
Medline and Embase.
eligibility Criteria
Cohort studies examining the association between 
atrial fibrillation and cardiovascular disease, renal 
disease, and death. Two reviewers independently 
extracted study characteristics and the relative risk of 
outcomes associated with atrial fibrillation: 
specifically, all cause mortality, cardiovascular 
mortality, major cardiovascular events, any stroke, 
ischaemic stroke, haemorrhagic stroke, ischaemic 
heart disease, sudden cardiac death, congestive heart 
failure, chronic kidney disease, and peripheral arterial 
disease. Estimates were pooled with inverse variance 
weighted random effects meta-analysis.
results
104 eligible cohort studies involving 9 686 513 
participants (587 867 with atrial fibrillation) were 
identified. Atrial fibrillation was associated with an 
increased risk of all cause mortality (relative risk 1.46, 
95% confidence interval 1.39 to 1.54), cardiovascular 
mortality (2.03, 1.79 to 2.30), major cardiovascular 
events (1.96, 1.53 to 2.51), stroke (2.42, 2.17 to 2.71), 
ischaemic stroke (2.33, 1.84 to 2.94), ischaemic heart 
disease (1.61, 1.38 to 1.87), sudden cardiac death (1.88, 
1.36 to 2.60), heart failure (4.99, 3.04 to 8.22), chronic 
kidney disease (1.64, 1.41 to 1.91), and peripheral 
arterial disease (1.31, 1.19 to 1.45) but not haemorrhagic 
stroke (2.00, 0.67 to 5.96). Among the outcomes 
examined, the highest absolute risk increase was for 
heart failure. Associations between atrial fibrillation 
and included outcomes were broadly consistent across 
subgroups and in sensitivity analyses.
COnClusiOns
Atrial fibrillation is associated with an increased risk of 
death and an increased risk of cardiovascular and 
renal disease. Interventions aimed at reducing 
outcomes beyond stroke are warranted in patients with 
atrial fibrillation.
Introduction
Atrial fibrillation is a leading cause of morbidity and 
mortality, with an estimated five million incident cases 
globally.1  It is increasing in prevalence in both develop-
ing and developed countries and is associated with an 
increased risk of all cause mortality and stroke, as well 
as higher medical costs and a reduced quality of life.2 
3
Although the prevention and management of stroke in 
atrial fibrillation has been the primary focus of guide-
lines4  and clinical trials,5 
6  recent studies have suggested 
that it can also be associated with a range of different car-
diovascular diseases, including ischaemic heart disease 
and chronic kidney disease.2 
7-10   
Individual studies, how-
ever, have provided conflicting estimates of the strength 
of the association between atrial fibrillation and a range 
of cardiovascular diseases and have not agreed on 
whether there are relevant associations at all, possibly 
because of the small sample sizes examined.11-14 Pooling 
all available evidence could allow for the determination 
of robust estimates of any associations that could inform 
outcome selection in future randomised controlled trials 
and guide public health efforts to reduce the incidence of 
associated cardiovascular disease.
We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis 
of the association between atrial fibrillation and cardio-
vascular disease and death to determine the relative 
and absolute risks of death and a range of associated 
cardiovascular outcomes. We also examined whether 
associations differed by important patient characteris-
tics, including age, the presence of cardiovascular dis-
ease, and baseline risk.
Methods
This study was conducted in accordance with the 
Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiol-
ogy (MOOSE) guidelines15  and the Preferred Reporting 
Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses 
(PRISMA) guidelines.16

librarian developed the search strategy (see table A in 
appendix). This was supplemented by a review of refer-
ences of included studies and review articles.
study selection criteria
We included cohort studies of adults with and without 
atrial fibrillation that reported a measure of relative risk 
for death or cardiovascular disease (described below) 
and a corresponding measure of variability. To avoid 
overestimating the association between atrial fibrilla-
tion and our outcomes of interest, we required studies 
to include a minimum of 50 participants with atrial 
fibrillation and 50 participants without. Studies were 
also required to have at least six months’ mean/median 
follow-up because we sought to assess the mid to long 
term risks associated with atrial fibrillation. No lan-
guage restrictions were applied, and non-English stud-
ies were translated by AJH, who has extensive 
experience in translating epidemiological studies.
Data extraction and quality assessment
Two reviewers (AO and CAE) independently reviewed 
titles and abstracts to assess studies for their inclusion. 
Three reviewers (AO, CXW, CAE) independently 
abstracted data using standardised forms. When avail-
able, we abstracted information on general study char-
acteristics (study name or investigator’s name, 
recruitment period, median duration of follow-up, year 
of publication of the primary findings), number of par-
ticipants with and without atrial fibrillation, mean age, 
number of men, and relative risk of outcomes.
We abstracted relative risk estimates and associated 
95% confidence intervals for the association between 
atrial fibrillation and all cause mortality, cardiovascular 
mortality, major cardiovascular events (a composite of 
cardiovascular death, fatal and non-fatal stroke, isch-
aemic heart disease, and congestive heart failure), and 
disease specific events: fatal and non-fatal stroke (all 
stroke or a stroke subtype if all stroke was not pro-
vided), fatal and non-fatal haemorrhagic stroke, fatal 
and non-fatal ischaemic stroke, ischaemic heart dis-
ease events (a composite of ischaemic heart disease 
death and non-fatal myocardial infarction), incident 
development of congestive heart failure, chronic kidney 
disease, and peripheral arterial disease. Maximally 
adjusted relative risk estimates were abstracted, along 
with the list of covariates included in the published 
multivariable regression model. Studies that did not 
report the variables that were adjusted for were 
excluded. One study that reported the development of 
end stage renal disease was included in the meta-anal-
ysis of chronic kidney disease.10
Studies were categorised as unadjusted, adequately 
adjusted, or well adjusted. Unadjusted studies did not 
adjust for any confounders and were excluded. Ade-
quately adjusted studies adjusted for, at a minimum, 
sex, age, and the presence of baseline cardiovascular 
disease. Well adjusted studies also adjusted for at least 
two established cardiovascular risk factors—blood 
pressure, cholesterol, smoking status, and diabetes. We 
chose these risk factors because they are important 
 
contributors to each of the outcomes examined in our 
study. Studies that did not report the covariates 
included in their regression model were also excluded 
because we could not determine whether they properly 
adjusted for important cofounders and thus whether 
they fulfilled the prespecified inclusion criteria of this 
meta-analysis. In our sensitivity analysis we stratified 
studies based on the level of adjustment.
We assessed risk of bias using the Newcastle-Ottawa 
scale,17 which assesses studies on three broad domains: 
the selection of participants for study groups; the com-
parability of study groups; and the ascertainment of the 
outcome. A star rating system is used and the maximum 
numbers of stars achievable are: selection (four stars), 
comparability (two), and outcome (cohort studies only; 
three stars). We applied strict criteria to assess compa-
rability (of individuals with or without atrial fibrilla-
tion) based on which variables were included in the 
multivariable models. To receive one star for compara-
bility, studies were required to meet the aforementioned 
criteria for adequate adjustment. To receive two stars, 
studies were required to meet the criteria for being well 
adjusted. Finally, studies were considered at low risk of 
bias if they achieved a full rating in at least two catego-
ries of selection, comparability, or outcome assessment.
statistical analysis
For all analyses, we calculated overall summary esti-
mates using inverse variance weighted random effects 
meta-analysis. For studies that reported separate rela-
tive risk estimates for subgroups (for example, different 
age groups, men versus women), we first used inverse 
variance weighted fixed effects meta-analysis to gener-
ate overall study level relative risks before random 
effects meta-analysis. Individual relative risk estimates 
and summary estimates were displayed graphically 
with forest plots. Heterogeneity was quantified with the 
I2 statistic and the Q test.
We calculated the absolute risk increase for each 
 
vascular outcome associated with atrial fibrillation by 
multiplying summary relative risks by the incidence 
rate of each outcome of interest. Specifically, ARI= 
(RR−1)×(ACR) where ARI is the absolute risk increase, 
RR is the relative risk, and ACR is the assumed control 
risk. As the US contributed the largest share of studies 
in our analysis, we used American Heart Association 
estimates of the incidence of cardiovascular mortality, 
ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, sudden cardiac 
death, and stroke.18  We used Centers for Disease 
 
Control and Prevention estimates of the incidence of 
all cause mortality19  and chronic kidney disease.20 
 
Absolute risk increases were expressed in events per 
1000 participant years of follow-up. As we could not 
obtain an estimate for the incidence of major cardiovas-
cular events in the US general population, we have not 
provided an absolute risk increase associated with 
atrial fibrillation for major cardiovascular events.

outcomes with nine or more studies (all cause mortality, 
cardiovascular mortality, major cardiovascular events, 
ischaemic heart disease, stroke, and ischaemic stroke). 
We conducted four stratified analyses to examine 
whether relative risks of outcomes were influenced by 
patients’ characteristics. We divided studies into thirds 
by the proportion of participants with a history of isch-
aemic heart disease at baseline, the proportion of par-
ticipants with a history of stroke at baseline, mean age, 
and absolute risk of death and cardiovascular disease 
(in events per 1000 patient years of follow-up). We 
tested for trend in these stratified analyses using 
 
random effects meta-regression. We did not examine 
whether relative risks were influenced by type of atrial 
fibrillation (chronic versus paroxysmal) as there were 
fewer than nine studies that reported on type for any 
given outcome of interest (table B in appendix).
We conducted six sensitivity analyses to examine 
whether heterogeneity between studies was caused by 
differences in study characteristics. We stratified stud-
ies by type of population (general population—for 
example, a community based cohort study—versus spe-
cific population—for example, a cohort study of individ-
uals with a history of stroke), year of publication, 
duration of follow-up, region of study conduct (Asia, 
Europe, US, international, other), method of ascertain-
ment of atrial fibrillation (electrocardiography only, 
electrocardiography and medical records, and medical 
records only), and level of adjustment for confounders 
(adequately adjusted v well adjusted).
We used a sequential exclusion strategy, as described 
by Patsopoulos and colleagues, to examine whether 
overall estimates were influenced by the substantial 
heterogeneity observed.21 We sequentially and cumula-
tively excluded studies that accounted for the largest 
share of heterogeneity until I2 was less than 50%. We 
then examined whether relative risk estimates were 
consistent. In accordance with Cochrane, evidence of 
publication bias was examined through funnel plots if 
there were more than 10 available studies.22  Funnel plot 
asymmetry was further confirmed with Egger’s test.23 
 
If asymmetry was present, we used the trim-and-fill 
method to adjust for publication bias.24
Patient involvement
No patients were involved in setting the research ques-
tion or the outcome measures, nor were they involved in 
developing plans for design or implementation of the 
study. No patients were asked to advise on interpreta-
tion or writing up of results. There are no plans to dis-
seminate the results of the research to study participants 
or the relevant patient community.
Results
We reviewed 4100 studies and excluded 3836 in the 
abstract screen. After we reviewed 264 full text articles, 
we excluded a further 160 (fig 1). We therefore included 
104 studies involving 9 686 513 patients in our 
meta-analysis. Of these individuals, 587 867 (6.1%) had 
atrial fibrillation. Five studies did not specify the 
method of ascertainment. Although outcome 
 
definitions were broadly consistent, the criteria applied 
in large prospective studies and secondary analyses of 
randomised trials were often more detailed than the cri-
teria applied in studies that were strictly reliant on 
administrative datasets. Based on the Newcastle Ottawa 
scale, 67 studies were judged to be at low risk of bias, 
and 69 provided estimates from well adjusted regres-
sion models. Detailed general characteristics of the 
included studies as well as the adjustments applied in 
regression models, outcome definitions, and risk of bias 
assessment are provided in tables B-E in the appendix.
all cause mortality

25-86  involving 1 009 501 patients 
examined all cause mortality as an outcome. There 
were 149 746 (14.8%) adults with atrial fibrillation, and 
the prevalence ranged from 0.2% to 56.3%. The median 
follow-up was 3.1 years (interquartile range 1-5.9). The 
pooled relative risk was 1.46 (95% confidence interval 
1.39 to 1.53; figs 2 and 3). Marked heterogeneity was 
observed (I2=93%, P<0.001). The corresponding abso-
lute risk increase in all cause mortality associated with 
atrial fibrillation, based on the US population, was 3.8 
events/1000 participant years (3.2 to 4.4). In subgroup 
analyses, studies were separated into thirds based on 
the proportion of adults with a history of ischaemic 
heart disease, the proportion with a history of stroke, 
mean participant age, and baseline absolute risk of all 
cause mortality. Relative risks of all cause mortality 
were consistent across all subgroups (P≥0.2 for trend, 
fig 4).

Cardiovascular mortality and major cardiovascular 
events
Fourteen studies2 11 32 61 66 68 70 75 77 78 81 82 87 88  involving 
342 453 patients examined cardiovascular mortality as 
an outcome. There were 17 167 (5.0%) adults with atrial 
fibrillation, and the prevalence ranged from 0.2% to 
56.3%. The median follow-up was 4.9 years (interquar-
tile range 2.8-11.4). The pooled relative risk was 2.03 
(95% confidence interval 1.79 to 2.30; fig 2  and fig A 
in appendix). The absolute risk increase in cardiovascu-
lar mortality associated with atrial fibrillation was 2.6 
events/1000 participant years (2.0 to 3.3). Nine

88-90  involving 2 467 017 patients exam-

were 21 707 (0.9%) adults with atrial fibrillation, and the 
prevalence ranged from 0.5% to 29.7%. The median 
 
follow-up was 4.4 years (4.0 to 10.1). Overall, atrial 
fibrillation was associated a 96% higher risk of major 
cardiovascular events (relative risk 1.96, 1.53 to 2.51; fig 2 
and fig B in appendix).
Both analyses showed considerable heterogeneity 
(I2=76% and P<0.001 for cardiovascular mortality and 
I2=98% and P<0.001 for major cardiovascular events). 
In subgroup analyses, the relative risk of cardiovascular 
mortality was lower with increasing age (P=0.05, fig C in 
appendix), and the relative risk of major cardiovascular 
events declined when we stratified studies based on the 
absolute event rate in their control group (P=0.03, fig D 
in appendix). Pooled relative risks for both outcomes 
were consistent for other subgroups examined (figs C 
and D in appendix).
stroke
Thirty eight studies2 31 33 42 48 52 61 68 70 71 77 78 81 82 87 88 91-112 
 
involving 6 143 925 patients reported results for any 
stroke. There were 430 600 (7.0%) adults with atrial 
fibrillation, and the prevalence ranged from 0.2% to 
50.7%. The median follow-up was 4.2 years (interquar-
tile range 1.7-8.0). The pooled relative risk was 2.42 (95% 
confidence interval 2.17 to 2.71; figs 2 and 5). There was 
considerable heterogeneity (I2=96%, P<0.001). The 
association between atrial fibrillation and stroke was 
consistent, irrespective of baseline demographics and 
clinical characteristics (fig E in appendix). The absolute 
risk increase of stroke associated with atrial fibrillation 
was 3.6 events/1000 participant years (3.0 to 4.3).
Twelve studies36 51 59 68 91 92 100 101 103 107 111 113 specifically 
reported results for ischaemic stroke. The pooled relative 
risk estimate was 2.33 (95% confidence interval 1.84 to 
2.94), and there was considerable heterogeneity (I2=87%, 
P<0.001; fig 2  and fig F in appendix). The relation 
between atrial fibrillation and ischaemic stroke was con-
sistent, irrespective of baseline demographics and clini-
cal characteristics (fig G in appendix). The absolute risk 
increase for ischaemic stroke was 2.9 events/1000 partic-
ipant years (1.9 to 4.3). Three  
studies68 91 107  reported 
results for haemorrhagic stroke. Atrial fibrillation was 
not associated with a higher risk of haemorrhagic stroke, 
although the confidence interval was wide (relative risk 
2.00, 0.67 to 5.96; fig 2 and fig H in appendix).
ischaemic heart disease and sudden cardiac death
Sixteen studies2 8 13 14 42 48 52 54 61 66 68 78 82 85 88 101  involving 
395 957 patients examined ischaemic heart disease as 
an outcome (figs 2 and 6). There were 30 977 (7.8%) 
adults with atrial fibrillation, and the prevalence 
ranged from 0.2% to 56.3%. The median follow-up was 
4.1 years (interquartile range 3.2-8.3). The pooled rela-
tive risk was 1.61 (95% confidence interval 1.38 to 1.87). 
There was considerable heterogeneity (I2=86%, 
P<0.001). The absolute risk increase for ischaemic 
heart disease was 1.4 events/1000 participant years 
(0.9 to 2). The pooled relative risk for ischaemic heart 
disease was consistent across subgroups of baseline 
cardiovascular disease, age, and baseline risk (fig I in 
appendix).
Seven studies13 45 54 85 114-116 involving 48 694 patients 
examined sudden cardiac death as an outcome. There 
were 6061 (12.4%) adults with atrial fibrillation, and the 
prevalence ranged from 0.6% to 28.9%. The median fol-
low-up was 3.0 years (interquartile range 2.8-4.4). The 
pooled relative risk of sudden cardiac death was 1.88 
(95% confidence interval 1.36 to 2.60; fig J in appendix). 
Though there was considerable heterogeneity (I2=78%, 
P<0.001), we did not perform sensitivity analyses 
because of the small number of studies. The absolute 
risk increase in sudden cardiac death was 0.6 
events/1000 participant years (0.2 to 1.1).
Congestive heart failure
Six studies2 42 71 101 117 118  involving 82 476 patients exam-
ined incident congestive heart failure as an outcome. 
There were 11 677 (14.2%) adults with atrial fibrilla-
tion, and the prevalence ranged from 0.6% to 43.2%. 
The median follow-up was 5.4 years (interquartile 
range 3.6-15.4). The pooled relative risk of incident 
congestive heart failure was 4.99 (95% confidence 
interval 3.04 to 8.22; fig 2 and fig K in appendix). 
Though there was considerable heterogeneity 
(I2=93%, P<0.001), we did not perform sensitivity 
analyses because of the small number of studies. The 
absolute risk increase in incident congestive heart 
failure associated with atrial fibrillation was 11.1 
(5.7 to 20) events/1000 participant years.

Chronic kidney disease and peripheral arterial 
disease
Three studies10 119 120 involving 467 000 patients exam-
ined chronic kidney disease as an outcome. There were 
20 312 (4.3%) adults with atrial fibrillation, and the 
prevalence ranged from 0.7% to 8.6%. The median fol-
low-up was 5.9 years (interquartile range 5.1-6.7). The 
pooled relative risk of chronic kidney disease was 1.64 
(95% confidence interval 1.41 to 1.91; fig L in appendix). 
Heterogeneity was non-significant (I2=50%, P=0.14). 
The absolute risk increase in chronic kidney disease 
associated with atrial fibrillation was 6.6 (4.3 to 9.4) 
events/1000 participant years.
Only one study121 examined the association between 
atrial fibrillation and peripheral arterial disease. The 
relative risk was 1.31 (95% confidence interval 1.19 to 
1.45) was reported.
sensitivity analyses
In sensitivity analyses of study characteristics, strati-
fied by type of population, method of ascertainment of 
atrial fibrillation, level of adjustment, year of publica-
tion, median follow-up, proportion receiving anticoag-
ulation, and location, the relative risks of outcomes 
were broadly consistent across strata. The relative risk 
of all cause mortality was lower in studies with a higher 
proportion of participants receiving anticoagulation 
(table F in appendix). No interaction was otherwise 
observed for all cause mortality and for cardiovascular 
mortality for any subgroups (P>0.05 for interaction/
trend; tables F and G in appendix). High levels of het-
erogeneity (I2>75%) continued to be observed in most 
sensitivity analyses. There was a stronger relative risk of 
major cardiovascular events associated with atrial 
fibrillation in studies conducted in a general popula-
tion than a specific population (relative risk 2.71 (95% 
confidence interval 1.82 to 4.04) v 1.39 (1.18 to 1.63), 
respectively; P=0.002 for interaction; table H in appen-
dix). Although a significant test result for interaction for 
major cardiovascular events by location was also 
observed, this was because of a single study that was 
conducted in the US. We found no other significant 
interactions for major cardiovascular events (P>0.05 for 
interaction/trend, table H in appendix) and no interac-
tions for stroke for any subgroups, including those 
based on the proportion of adults with atrial fibrillation 
receiving anticoagulation (table I in appendix). Relative 
risks of ischaemic stroke and ischaemic heart disease 
were stronger in studies conducted in general popula-
tions than in studies conducted in specific populations 
(P<0.05 for interaction, tables J and K in appendix). Rel-
ative risks of ischaemic stroke and ischaemic heart dis-
ease were also larger in studies with a longer follow-up 
(P=0.04 and 0.01, respectively, for trend, tables J and K 
in appendix). The relative risk of ischaemic stroke did 
not vary based on proportion of adults with atrial fibril-
lation receiving anticoagulation.
When we sequentially excluded studies contributing 
the largest amount to heterogeneity until I2 was less 
than 50%, pooled relative risks for outcomes were sim-
ilar to the original estimates (table L in appendix). Atrial

fibrillation remained associated with an increased risk 
of all cause mortality (relative risk 1.41, 95% confidence 
interval 1.35 to 1.46), cardiovascular mortality (2.02, 1.82 
to 2.24), major cardiovascular events (1.72, 1.63 to 1.83), 
ischaemic heart disease (1.46, 1.34 to 1.59), stroke (2.95, 
2.49 to 3.48), and ischaemic stroke (2.64, 2.34 to 2.97).
Funnel plots showed no evidence of publication bias 
for any outcome (figs M-Q in appendix; Egger’s test 
P>0.05), except for stroke (fig P in appendix; Egger’s 
test P=0.006). Use of trim-and-fill method resulted in a 
relative risk of 1.69 (95% confidence interval 1.51 to 1.89) 
for stroke.
discussion
In this comprehensive overview of the association 
between atrial fibrillation and the risk of cardiovascular 
disease, renal disease, and death, there was an 
increased risk of a range of different outcomes, includ-
ing a 46% higher risk of all cause mortality, 61% higher 
risk of ischaemic heart disease, 64% higher risk of 
chronic kidney disease, 88% higher risk of sudden car-
diac death, and 96% higher risk of a major cardiovascu-
lar event. Atrial fibrillation was also associated with a 
twofold risk of cardiovascular mortality, 2.3-fold risk of 
stroke, and fivefold risk of incident congestive heart 
failure. The absolute risk increase for heart failure was 
the highest among the outcomes examined. Finally, 
associations between atrial fibrillation and these out-
comes were broadly consistent across subgroups and in 
sensitivity analyses.
Comparison with previous individual studies
Our study adds to the growing literature on the associa-
tion between atrial fibrillation and cardiovascular 
 
outcomes beyond stroke. In a retrospective cohort study 
of Medicare beneficiaries, investigators showed that 
heart failure was the most common non-fatal cardiovas-
cular event among adults with atrial fibrillation.122  Fur-
thermore, in an analysis of the RE-LY trial, which was a 
trial in patients with atrial fibrillation, cardiac deaths—
sudden cardiac death and progressive heart failure—
accounted for 37.4% of all deaths, whereas deaths 
related to stroke and haemorrhage accounted for 9.8% 
of all deaths.123 In our study, the relative and absolute 
risk of incident congestive heart failure was the highest 
among all outcomes studied.
Furthermore, we observed that atrial fibrillation was 
associated with an increased risk of ischaemic heart 
disease, chronic kidney disease, and sudden cardiac 
death, even though some individual studies reported 
non-significant associations. Notably, although the rel-
ative associations between atrial fibrillation and these 
outcomes were comparable, the absolute risk increases 
for ischaemic heart disease (1.4 events per 1000 partici-
pant years) and chronic kidney disease (6.6 events) 
were several times larger than for sudden cardiac death 
(0.6 events) because of the lower baseline incidence of 
sudden cardiac death in the general population.
Our assessment of the consistency of relative risk 
estimates across demographic and clinical subgroups 
of participants is an important expansion on previous 
studies, many of which have limited their analysis to a 
single patient subgroup, such as those with ischaemic 
heart disease and congestive heart failure.124 We 
observed that the association between atrial fibrillation 
and cardiovascular disease and death was generally 
consistent, irrespective of baseline history of ischaemic 
heart disease, baseline history of stroke, mean partici-
pant age, and baseline risk. There were, however, two 
notable exceptions. Firstly, relative risk estimates for 
general population studies were typically larger than 
estimates based on studies in specific settings. This 
could be related to the selection of the controls and the 
proportion of patients with atrial fibrillation receiving 
effective evidence based treatments. Secondly, the rela-
tive risk of all cause mortality was lower in studies with 
a higher proportion of participants receiving anticoagu-
lation, but we did not observe a similar pattern for 
stroke. The absence of any association between the rel-
ative risk of stroke and the use of anticoagulation 
should be interpreted with caution because of the small 
number of studies included in this analysis. Further-
more, if warfarin is used, it is difficult to determine the 
effectiveness of anticoagulation without measurements 
of INR (international normalised ratio). Differences in 
the proportion of adults with a low INR would affect our 
stratified analyses for stroke.
While relative associations between atrial fibrillation 
and cardiovascular disease and death were generally 
similar across participant characteristics, absolute 
increases in risk associated with atrial fibrillation 
would be expected to be larger among individuals with 
a higher baseline risk of cardiovascular disease. These 
results therefore suggest that atrial fibrillation is 
 
associated with greater absolute increases in risk of

line risk and highlights the importance of risk stratifica-
tion of participants with atrial fibrillation.
strengths and limitations
The key strength of our study is its sample size. We were 
able to identify 104 cohort studies, many more than pre-
vious analyses of atrial fibrillation restricted to subpop-
ulations. There were, however, some important 
limitations to consider. Firstly, despite our extensive 
search strategy, we could have missed relevant studies 
for inclusion. The large number of studies in our 
 
analysis, however, made our results robust to the inclu-
sion of any single study. It also provided us with the 
power to investigate whether the associations between 
atrial fibrillation and cardiovascular disease and death 
differed by important patient and study characteristics 
as well as to conduct detailed sensitivity analyses. 
 
Secondly, we observed high levels of heterogeneity 
(I2>70%) for all vascular outcomes except for chronic 
kidney disease. This was not unexpected and might be 
caused by differences in study designs, methodological 
characteristics, type of atrial fibrillation, use of second-
ary prevention (such as anticoagulation) among 
included studies, and the definition and ascertainment 
of endpoints. For instance, the criteria in well estab-
lished prospective cohorts8  were comprehensively 
detailed, whereas the criteria and specific diagnostic 
codes used in analyses of administrative data were not 
consistently provided.51 Differences in the diagnostic 
codes used in administrative data could have contrib-
uted to the high heterogeneity in our study. Nonethe-
less, when we systematically and sequentially excluded 
individual studies until heterogeneity was moderate 
(I2<50%), relative risk estimates for vascular outcomes 
were consistent and significant, suggesting that the 
high levels of heterogeneity were not inflating summary 
relative risk estimates. Thirdly, studies were classified 
as well adjusted if they adjusted for age, sex, baseline 
cardiovascular disease, and at least two cardiovascular 
risk factors. Even though more stringent criteria could 
be used, such as requiring studies to adjust for drugs 
and outcome specific risk factors (for example, adjust-
ment for race for the outcome of chronic kidney dis-
ease), there will nonetheless be residual confounding 
in the estimates derived from observational studies. 
Accordingly, it is likely that there are other variables 
that contribute to the association between atrial fibrilla-
tion and our outcomes of interest, in addition to any 
possible causal disease specific effects. Fourthly, 
because of our strict selection criteria, we identified 
fewer than nine studies for some outcomes and were 
unable to conduct sensitivity analyses. This is particu-
larly important for congestive heart failure because the 
relative and absolute risk estimates for incident conges-
tive heart failure were the highest among the outcomes 
we examined. It is therefore noteworthy that four of the 
six studies2 
42 
71 
101 we included in our meta-analysis for 
incident congestive heart failure were conducted in 
general population cohorts and accounted for 75% of 
the weight for the summary relative risk. Fifthly, studies 
that reported significant associations between atrial 
fibrillation and cardiovascular disease and death might 
be more likely to be published. We did not, however, 
observe evidence of publication bias for any outcome 
other than stroke. Finally, we lacked individual patient 
data, which would have allowed us to systematically 
adjust for patient characteristics. We did not, however, 
observe any interaction when we compared studies 
based on our risk of bias assessment.
implications for clinicians, policy makers, and 
future research
The mechanism by which atrial fibrillation is associated 
with an increased risk of a range of different cardiovas-
cular diseases is unclear. In the case of myocardial 
infarction, atrial fibrillation could contribute to demand 
infarction and the subsequent development of type 2 
myocardial infarction.7  It is also possible that the

association between atrial fibrillation and non-stroke 
cardiovascular disease is not causal. Considering our 
observation that atrial fibrillation is also associated 
with an increased risk of heart failure, sudden cardiac 
death, and chronic kidney disease (in addition to isch-
aemic heart disease), it seems likely that atrial fibrilla-
tion could be acting as a marker for shared underlying 
risk factors for cardiovascular disease. These include 
hypertension, which is diagnosed in up to 90% of 
patients with atrial fibrillation, as well as obesity, dia-
betes, and obstructive sleep apnoea.125 
126
Even though the associations we describe cannot 
indicate causality for the non-stroke outcomes, there is 
merit in developing clinical risk prediction models for 
outcomes such as congestive heart failure; particularly 
given our relative and absolute risk estimates. To date, 
three models have been developed with C statistics 
ranging from 0.7 to 0.84, but none has been externally 
validated.127-129 Future models might also benefit from 
inclusion of non-invasive measures of cardiac function 
and assessments of novel biomarkers.
Finally, our study could have implications for the pri-
oritisation of public health resources and the develop-
ment of novel interventions for adults with atrial 
fibrillation. In particular, the development and testing 
of novel oral anticoagulants has been the principal 
focus of clinical care in atrial fibrillation, but recent 
studies have shown that these drugs reduce mortality 
related to stroke, with little reduction in mortality 
related to congestive heart failure and sudden cardiac 
death.123  Similarly, pharmacological control of atrial 
fibrillation and the restoration of sinus rhythm has 
shown no benefit over rate control for sudden cardiac 
death,130  worsening heart failure,131  or mortality.130 
It could be that rhythm control treatments might not 
have been effective at treating atrial fibrillation or that 
the treatments resulted in additional side effects that 
outweighed the benefits of restoring sinus rhythm. 
Alternatively, if atrial fibrillation is not the cause of 
these non-stroke outcomes, this could explain the 
absence of treatment benefit even when it is controlled.
Accordingly, reduction of the burden of non-stroke 
events in adults with atrial fibrillation would benefit 
from a focus on primary prevention and management of 
cardiovascular risk factors. Evidence based strategies in 
this regard include discussion of the concept of pre-
dicted cardiovascular risk with patients and calculation 
of their cardiovascular age.132  Regular updates should 
also be provided to patients after lifestyle changes and/
or pharmacotherapy have begun as a way to encourage 
further progress.132
In conclusion, atrial fibrillation is associated with car-
diovascular and renal events, including  
cardiovascular 
mortality, major cardiovascular events, heart failure, 
ischaemic heart disease, chronic kidney disease, and 
sudden cardiac death, as well as stroke and all cause 
mortality. The relative and absolute risk increase associ-
ated with many of these events is greater than that of 
stroke. Interventions are needed to reduce the risk of 
non-stroke outcomes in adults with atrial fibrillation.
