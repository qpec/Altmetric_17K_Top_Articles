BACKGROUND: Postoperative management of prostate cancer with lymph node involvement (LNI) is controversial. Retrospective evi-
dence supports the selective use of radiotherapy (RT) after extended pelvic lymph node dissection. It is unclear whether this is gen-
eralizable to practice in the United States, where extended dissection is uncommon. The authors identified patients with LNI who
potentially could derive a survival benefit with adjuvant RT plus androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT). METHODS: Patients with N1M0
prostate adenocarcinoma who underwent radical prostatectomy (RP) and subsequently received ADT from 2003 through 2011 were
identified from the National Cancer Database. Kaplan-Meier analyses, log-rank tests, and multivariable Cox proportional hazards re-
gression were performed using overall survival (OS) as the primary outcome. RESULTS: In total, 906 of 2569 eligible patients (35.3%)
received RT, and RT was more frequently received by patients who were diagnosed in later years, had fewer positive lymph nodes,
had involved surgical margins, and were aged <65 years (all P <.05). The 5-year OS rate was 87% versus 82% in those who received
RT versus those who did not (P 5.007). After propensity score matching, 826 patients remained in each cohort. RT retained an asso-
ciation with OS (5-year OS: 88% vs 81%; P 5.009; hazard ratio, 1.43; 95% confidence interval, 1.10-1.86; P 5.008). No interaction was
identified between the effect of RT on OS across tested strata of total lymph nodes examined, lymph node ratio, total number of pos-
itive lymph nodes, margin status, Gleason score, and prostate-specific antigen. CONCLUSIONS: RT plus ADT was associated with im-
proved OS after RP in patients with LNI. These results may help guide therapy in the absence of randomized evidence. Cancer

INTRODUCTION
Prostate adenocarcinoma (ACP) is the most commonly diagnosed noncutaneous malignancy in males within the United
States. Approximately 12% of these patients, or 26,500 in total, had regional lymph node involvement (LNI) at diagnosis
in 2015.1 This is a heterogeneous group with ultimately poor cancer-related outcomes.2,3 Despite the prevalence of LNI,
there is a dearth of high-level evidence available to guide genitourinary oncologists in its optimal management.
Pathologic LNI after radical prostatectomy (RP) is a clinical scenario of increasingly relevance for several reasons.
LNI has declined significantly in the era of routine prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening.4 With recent US Preventa-
tive Task Force recommendations against routine PSA screening, there is reasonable expectation that LNI at diagnosis
may again become more prevalent.5,6 Before routine PSA screening, early modern prostatectomy series estimated a rate of
LNI nearing 30%.7 There are evolving indications for RP, as clinical practice guidelines increasingly accept RP as a poten-
tial first-line therapy for select patients with high-risk ACP. These patients are at high risk for harboring LNI.8 In addition,
conventional imaging techniques are inadequate for definitively assessing preoperative lymph node staging.9

 Traditional dogma recognized LNI as a proxy for oc-
cult metastatic disease and thus probably not suitable for
curative management. However, mounting retrospective
evidence does suggest an improvement in outcomes in
some men who receive aggressive locoregional therapy.10-
13 In the high-risk, lymph node-negative, postprostatec-
tomy setting, multiple randomized trials have identified a
benefit with the addition of adjuvant radiotherapy
(RT).14-16 We identified only 1 trial that investigated
postprostatectomy adjuvant ADT for patients with
N1M0 disease,17 and no trials evaluating local therapy
have been conducted in this setting. Well conducted ob-
servational series have identified subgroups of men with
LNI who derived a survival benefit from adjuvant
RT.12,18 However, all patients in those series underwent
an extended pelvic lymph node dissection (ePLND), a
procedure that is not used frequently in the United
States.19 It is unclear whether these results can be general-
ized to a population that typically undergoes less extensive
lymph node sampling.20
We sought to compare survival outcomes of patients
who had pathologic LNI after prostatectomy and received
either guideline-supported adjuvant ADT alone versus ad-
juvant RT plus ADT using a large national cancer data-
base.
In addition,
we
sought
to
identify specific
clinicopathologic subgroups that may derive preferential
benefit from the addition of RT.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The National Cancer Database (NCDB) is a large, pro-
spectively acquired database that draws on information
gathered from Commission on Cancer-accredited cancer
centers nationwide. It currently captures 70% of all newly
diagnosed malignancies in the United States. The data set
includes detailed information on patient characteristics,
disease parameters, treatment information, and outcomes.
The treatment information contains data not available in
other large national databases, including detailed RT in-
formation regarding treatment site, treatment source,
treatment intent, radiation dose (in grays), and receipt of
ADT (with ADT referring to any form of hormone
suppression).
The NCDB prostate cancer database was queried for
patients aged �18 years who were diagnosed between
2003 and 2011. Adjuvant RT was defined as pelvic or
prostatic radiation delivered with curative intent within 6
months after prostatectomy. Inclusion criteria were as fol-
lows: adenocarcinoma histology, pathologic involvement
of regional lymph nodes, receipt of RP plus subsequent
adjuvant ADT, and 1 lifetime cancer or cases in which the
reported tumor was the first of multiple diagnoses. Exclu-
sion criteria were patients those encoded with the follow-
ing: metastatic disease at diagnosis; patients who were
diagnosed at the reporting facility but treated elsewhere;
patients who received cobalt-60 teletherapy, stereotactic
radiosurgery, brachytherapy, or another nonstandard ap-
proach; palliative-intent therapy; and patients with un-
known
survival
information.
Patient
and
disease
parameters were examined and included facility type, age,
race, insurance status and type, area of residence/rural or
urban county, income, education level, Charlson-Deyo
comorbidity score, year of diagnosis, histology, tumor
grade, tumor (T) classification, regional lymph node
count, lymph node ratio (the numbers of positive lymph
nodes/lymph nodes examined), Gleason score from pros-
tatectomy specimen, PSA, surgical margin status, chemo-
therapy, and radiation dose. Income and education level
were abstracted by the NCDB based on zip code of resi-
dence and were matched to 2012 American Community
Survey and 2000 US Census data, respectively. Facility
type was determined using Commission on Cancer defini-
tions. Insurance was categorized as none, private, or gov-
ernment
(includes
Medicare,
Medicaid,
and
other
government insurance). The primary endpoint of OS was
defined as the number of months between surgery and ei-
ther death or last follow-up if the patient remained alive.
Statistical Methods
Statistical analyses were conducted using SAS version 9.4
(SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, NC) and SAS macros developed
by the Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Shared Resource at
Winship Cancer Institute.21 Descriptive statistics for each
variable were reported. The univariate association with
treatment groups (RT vs no RT) was assessed using the
chi-square test for categorical covariates and analyses of
variance for numerical covariates. The univariate associa-
tion with OS was assessed using Cox proportional hazards
models and log-rank tests. Guarantee time bias was
accounted for using an extended Cox model considering
RT as a time-varying variable.22 A plot of extended
Kaplan-Meier estimates was generated accordingly.23 The
multivariable models were built using a backward
variable-selection procedure with an a 5 .2 for removal
criteria. All P values were 2 sided, and P < .05 was consid-
ered statistically significant. To further reduce treatment
selection bias, a propensity score-matching method also
was implemented. A logistic regression model predicting
RT versus non-RT was used to calculate propensity scores
in covariates that were identified as confounders in the fi-
nal multivariable extended model. Patients from each

 study cohort were matched to each other at ratio of 1:1
based on the propensity score using a greedy 5!1 digit
match algorithm.24 After matching, the balance of covari-
ates between 2 cohorts were evaluated using the standard-
ized differences, and a value of < .1 was considered a
negligible imbalance (see Supporting Tables 1 and 2 for
standardized differences before and after matching; see
online supporting information). The effects were estimat-
ed in the matched sample using a Cox model with a robust
variance estimator for OS.25
RESULTS
In total, 2569 patients diagnosed between 2003 and 2011
met the study entry criteria (Table 1). Of these, 906
patients (35.3%) received adjuvant RT plus ADT. The
median follow-up was 53 months. The median patient
age was 62 years (range, 37-85 years). The majority of
patients (65.2%) were aged < 65 years. Most had a
Charlson-Deyo score of 0 or 1 (98.1%). The majority of
patients had pathologic T3 (pT3) disease (n 5 2508;
77.5%). In addition, 55.8% of patients had 1 positive
lymph node, 20% had 2 positive lymph nodes, 22.7%
had � 3 positive lymph nodes, and 1.5% had an unknown
number of positive lymph nodes. The median number of
lymph nodes involved was 1, and the median number of
lymph nodes examined was 8. The median lymph node
density was 20%. The majority of patients had a Gleason
score from 8 to 10 (56.4%). The median time from sur-
gery to radiation was 3.45 months (range, 0.39-6
months), and the median radiation dose used was 67
grays.
A comparison of patient, treatment, and disease
characteristics by receipt of adjuvant RT is presented in
Table 1. RT was more likely to be received by younger
patients (P < .001); it was used more frequently in the set-
ting of fewer involved lymph nodes (P < .001), a lymph
node density �20% (P < .001), and with involved surgi-
cal margin (P < .001). There was increased use of RT over
the studied period (P < .001). Patients who had private
insurance or nonacademic centers were more likely to re-
ceive RT (P < .001). RT receipt did not appear to be asso-
ciated with higher Gleason score or pretreatment PSA.
The actuarial 5-year rate OS was 87% in patients
who received RT plus ADT versus 82% in those who re-
ceived ADT alone (P 5 .007) (Fig. 1). The receipt of RT
plus ADT was associated with an improvement in OS
over ADT alone in multivariate analysis (P < .001; hazard
ratio [HR], 1.50; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.18-
1.90). Additional factors associated with poorer OS in-
cluded treatment at an nonacademic or research facility,
�3 lymph nodes involved, positive surgical margins,
pT3-positive pathologic tumor, and a Gleason score >7
(all P < .05) (see Table 2). Neither the number of lymph
nodes removed nor the pretreatment PSA level was inde-
pendently associated with survival. Patients who had un-
known T-classification fared significantly worse than
those who had T2 tumors, and men with unknown Glea-
son scores performed significantly worse than those who
had Gleason scores from 2 to 7. This is consistent, because
the unknown values are likely a representative sampling of
the entire population.
A propensity score-matched analysis was performed.
Eight hundred twenty-six patients remained in each co-
hort after matching. The groups were well balanced, and
there were no statistically significant differences between
groups in any of the tested variables. The actuarial 5-year
OS rate was 88% in men who received RT plus ADT ver-
sus 81% in those who received ADT alone (P 5 .004)
(Fig. 2), with an HR of 1.43 (95% CI, 1.10-1.86).
No interaction was identified between the OS effect
of adjuvant treatment type across the tested strata of total
number of lymph nodes examined, Gleason score, total
number of positive lymph nodes, surgical margin status,
lymph node ratio, and pretreatment PSA level. This indi-
cates that the identified benefit of RT plus ADT exists
across all strata within these variables. Finally, an optimal
cutoff point analysis to dichotomize lymph node ratio by
OS identified a value of 27%.
DISCUSSION
Prostate cancer with LNI after prostatectomy is a fre-
quently encountered clinical scenario without a well de-
fined treatment paradigm. Historically, prostatectomy
was aborted with the intraoperative discovery of LNI, be-
cause it was considered indicative of a systemic disease.26
This tenet is carried forth in the American Joint Commit-
tee on Cancer (AJCC) staging criteria (AJCC Cancer Stag-
ing Manual, seventh edition), in which, regardless of
lymph node burden, regional lymph node involvement
shares the same stage grouping as distant metastatic dis-
ease.27 However, mounting evidence suggests there is sub-
stantial
heterogeneity
within
the
N-positive/M0
population, similar to other solid tumor disease sites.
Some patients, particularly those with fewer involved
lymph nodes, may derive a cure from aggressive locore-
gional treatment strategies.3,28,29 Indeed, the results from
our study suggest that the addition of RT to ADT after
prostatectomy confers a significant OS benefit. In addi-
tion, our study provides compelling evidence regarding
heterogeneity within the pN-positive/M0 population.

 There is a paucity of level 1 evidence regarding the
management
of
surgically
treated
pN-positive/M0
patients. Messing et al conducted the only randomized tri-
al in this domain and identified a survival benefit with im-
mediate versus delayed ADT after prostatectomy.17 Data
regarding the role of adjuvant radiotherapy are further
limited. At least one-third of pN-positive/M0 patients re-
cur within the pelvis after surgery and thus may benefit
from escalated local therapy.30,31 Three randomized stud-
ies demonstrated improved cancer-related outcomes with
the addition of adjuvant radiation in the locally advanced
but lymph node-negative postprostatectomy setting. It is
challenging to extrapolate the results of these studies to
the lymph node-positive setting.
Several retrospective series have examined the role
adjuvant RT in this population. Pooled outcomes analyses
from 2 high-volume centers provide much of our under-
standing of this disease.12,18,29 In the most recent update,
adjuvant RT plus ADT improved OS compared with ad-
juvant ADT alone. Two risk groups—men with � 2 in-
volved lymph nodes plus Gleason scores �7 and those
with either positive surgical margins or pT3b/pT4 tumors
and 3 or 4 involved lymph nodes—drove the survival ben-
efit. All patients in that series underwent ePLND. Both
the utility and therapeutic value of ePLND is a subject of
ongoing debate.32 Nonetheless, this practice is used only
in a minority of patients treated in the United States.19,33
The median number of lymph nodes removed in our
study was only 8 compared with 14 in the study previous-
ly discussed study by Abdollah et al.32 In our series, sur-
vival did not appear to be improved by more extensive
lymph node dissection. However, with a limited dissec-
tion, the total number of involved lymph nodes may not
be truly reflective of disease burden and thus, alone, may
not be able to guide decisions regarding prognosis and ad-
juvant therapy. Previous series have identified a lymph
node density between 20% and 30% for stratifying
patients at high risk for recurrence.34,35 Our analysis iden-
tified 27% as the most meaningful cutoff point to dichot-
omize OS. In addition, those who had �3 involved
lymph nodes had a significantly worsened OS. However,
we did not identify any differential treatment effect of ad-
juvant RT plus ADT stratified according to the number
of positive lymph nodes, the total number of lymph nodes

 examined, or the lymph node ratio. This suggests that, re-
gardless of the overall lymph node burden, adjuvant RT
plus ADT improves survival.
Three Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results
population-based analyses have been conducted, and
none has identified a benefit from adjuvant RT.20,36,37
Notably, receipt of ADT was not reported in 2 series and
was used only in a minority of patients in the other series.
In an exploratory analysis for our study (Supporting Fig.
1), we investigated survival in all patients (n 5 7902), not
only those who received ADT. In that cohort, no OS ben-
efit was observed from adjuvant RT: the 5-year OS rate
was 87.6% with RT versus 85% with no RT (P 5 .081).
When the analysis was restricted to those who received ad-
juvant ADT, there was a 5% OS survival benefit at 5 years
(P 5 .007). In an unplanned subset analysis of Radiation
Therapy Oncology Group trial 8531, patients with
N1M0 disease had improved OS with RT plus ADT ver-
sus RT alone.38 Roughly 25% of those patients were
treated after prostatectomy. We speculate that micrometa-
static control may potentiate the survival benefit conferred
by improved local control. This pattern is observed in
multiple other solid tumor subsites.
Our study is clinically impactful for several reasons.
We identified a survival benefit with the addition of adju-
vant RT plus ADT for patients with pN-positive/M0
prostate cancer. In the propensity-matched analysis,
which allows the estimation of a causal effect, the benefit
of RT plus ADT persisted. Patients who did not receive
adjuvant RT plus ADT had a 1.4-fold risk of death. This
is the largest series to date examining outcomes in this co-
hort. Data from this study come from a large registry rep-
resentative of patients treated across the United States.
The study was not restricted to those who were treated at
high-volume centers or who would meet strict eligibility
criteria for clinical trials and thus is generalizable. These
factors are significant given the incongruity of surgical
and radiation technique and practice in managing this dis-
ease. Finally, we provide further evidence of the heteroge-
neity within men with pN-positive/M0 disease. Patient
outcomes related not only to lymph node status but also
to clinicopathologic factors of the primary tumor. Out-
comes were independently poorer in those who had posi-
tive
surgical
margins,
higher
Gleason
scores,
and
advanced T-classification. Adjuvant RT plus ADT
appears to improve outcomes regardless of the number of
involved lymph nodes, the number of lymph nodes

 dissected, the lymph node ratio, the Gleason score, the
surgical margin status, and the pretreatment PSA level.
Along with the retrospective nature of this study,
our analysis has several meaningful limitations. Similar to
other cancer registry-based analyses, there are potential
uncaptured confounders that may have led to an imbal-
ance between the comparative groups despite the
propensity-matched analysis. We lacked information re-
garding pretreatment staging, postoperative PSA levels,
duration of ADT, and architecture of the involved lymph
nodes. The presence of extracapsular extension, lymph
node cancer volume, and lymph node size are all potential
predictors of patient outcome.39 Postoperative PSA is a
variable missing from all published series examining the
question of adjuvant RT. This is unfortunate, because this
factor is used clinically to help ascertain undissected
lymph node burden and extrapelvic disease and thus to
guide the selection of adjuvant therapy. Information re-
garding RT treatment volume is coded inconsistently
within the NCDB; therefore, we did not include it in our
analysis. Finally, toxicity information is not captured by
the NCDB, so we cannot comment on differences in this
outcome between treatment groups.
In conclusion, the current results demonstrate that
combined adjuvant RT plus ADT is associated with a sub-
stantial improvement OS compared with ADT alone in
patients who have pN-positive/M0 prostate cancer after
prostatectomy. RT plus ADT improves OS across all stra-
ta in tested variables, including PSA, lymph Gleason
score, surgical margin status, lymph node ratio, the num-
ber of lymph nodes examined, and the number involved
lymph nodes. Given the growing body of retrospective ev-
idence, there is a pressing need for a prospective, random-
ized trial evaluating locoregional treatment for lymph
node-positive prostate cancer. In the absence of level I evi-
dence, the current results can help guide management
within this patient population.
