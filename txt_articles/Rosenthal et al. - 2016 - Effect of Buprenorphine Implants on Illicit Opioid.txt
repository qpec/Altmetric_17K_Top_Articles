IMPORTANCE The effectiveness of buprenorphine treatment of opioid dependence is limited
by suboptimal medication adherence, abuse, and diversion.
OBJECTIVE To determine whether 6-month buprenorphine implants are noninferior to daily
sublingual buprenorphine as maintenance treatment for opioid-dependent patients with
stable abstinence.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Outpatient, randomized, active-controlled, 24-week,
double-blind, double-dummy study conducted at 21 US sites from June 26, 2014, through
May 18, 2015. Outpatients were prescribed daily sublingual buprenorphine for 6 months or
more, were abstinent while taking 8 mg/d or less of sublingual buprenorphine for 90 days or
longer, and were determined to be clinically stable by their physician.
INTERVENTIONS Participants were randomized to receive sublingual buprenorphine plus 4
placebo implants or sublingual placebo plus four 80-mg buprenorphine hydrochloride
implants (expected efficacy, 24 weeks).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE The primary end point was between-group difference in
proportion of responders (�4 of 6 months without opioid-positive urine test result [monthly
and 4 times randomly] and self-report). The noninferiority established for the lower bound of
the 95% confidence interval was greater than −0.20 (P < .025). Secondary end points
included cumulative percentage of negative opioid urine results, abstinence, and time to first
illicit opioid use. Safety was assessed by adverse event reporting.
RESULTS Of 177 participants (mean age, 39 years; 40.9% female), 90 were randomized to
sublingual buprenorphine with placebo implants and 87 to buprenorphine implants with
sublingual placebo; 165 of 177 (93.2%) completed the trial. Eighty-one of 84 (96.4%)
receiving buprenorphine implants and 78 of 89 (87.6%) receiving sublingual buprenorphine
were responders, an 8.8% difference (1-sided 97.5% CI, 0.009 to �; P < .001 for
noninferiority). Over 6 months, 72 of 84 (85.7%) receiving buprenorphine implants and 64 of
89 (71.9%) receiving sublingual buprenorphine maintained opioid abstinence (hazard ratio,
13.8; 95% CI, 0.018-0.258; P = .03). Non–implant-related and implant-related adverse events
occurred in 48.3% and 23% of the buprenorphine implant group and in 52.8% and 13.5% of
participants in the sublingual buprenorphine group, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among adults with opioid dependence maintaining
abstinence with a stable dose of sublingual buprenorphine, the use of buprenorphine
implants compared with continued sublingual buprenorphine did not result in an inferior
likelihood of remaining a responder. However, the study population had an exceptionally high
response rate in the control group, and further studies are needed in broader populations to
assess the efficacy in other settings.

O
pioid dependence is a growing public health concern
in the United States, associated with spread of human
immunodeficiencyvirusandhepatitisCandfatalover-
dose when left untreated.1-3 Medical treatment of opioid de-
pendence decreases illicit opioid use at a greater rate com-
pared with psychosocial intervention or placebo alone4-7 and
reducesmorbidity,mortality,8andspreadofinfectiousdiseases.9
Because only 3 available medications—methadone, buprenor-
phine, and naltrexone—are approved for treatment of opioid
dependence,5,10 innovation is needed.
A 6-month buprenorphine implant may improve treat-
ment adherence, improve rates of opioid abstinence, and re-
duce susceptibility to increasing public health concerns of
abuse, diversion, and unintentional pediatric exposure.11 The
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that 9.5%
of emergency hospitalizations for drug ingestion among chil-
dren younger than 6 years were caused by buprenorphine/
naloxone, despite buprenorphine accounting for 2.2% of re-
tail opioid prescriptions and 0.16% of all retail prescriptions.12
Opioid dependence is a chronic, relapsing disorder. Little
research has investigated tactics to support long-term remis-
sion; long-acting implants may sustain long-term remission. In
double-blind, phase 3, placebo-controlled trials among opioid-
dependent, treatment-seeking participants newly inducted to
12to16mg/dofsublingualbuprenorphineandsubsequentlyran-
domized,buprenorphineimplantsweresuperiortoplaceboim-
plantsinreducingillicitopioiduseovertheinitial6-monthtreat-
ment period.13,14 The purpose of this trial was to determine if
6-month subdermal buprenorphine implants maintained low
to no illicit opioid use relative to daily sublingual buprenor-
phine among currently stable opioid-dependent patients re-
ceiving buprenorphine maintenance treatment.
Methods
Study Design and Oversight
This randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, active-
controlled, 26-week, multisite study in adult clinically stable
outpatients receiving 8 mg/d or less of sublingual buprenor-
phine evaluated the safety and efficacy of 4 simultaneously
placed, 26 × 2.5-mm buprenorphine implants (buprenor-
phine hydrochloride, 80 mg each) compared with daily sub-
lingual buprenorphine (Figure 1). The study was conducted at
21 US office-based buprenorphine outpatient treatment sites.
Each site approved the protocol (Supplement) through a cen-
tralized or local institutional review board (IRB) and ob-
tained written informed consent from each volunteer prior to
participation. Participants received an IRB-approved stipend
for attending study visits (average per visit = $40; total sti-
pend range, $350-$725).
Participants
Eligible participants had a primary diagnosis of opioid
dependence,15 were aged 18 to 65 years, received sublingual
buprenorphine for at least 24 weeks as an outpatient at a stable
dosage of 8 mg/d or less, and showed no evidence of opioid
withdrawal or illicit opioid-positive urine samples for at least
90 days prior to study entry. Female participants of childbear-
ing potential agreed to use contraception during the study.
Exclusion criteria included pregnancy, lactation, or plan-
ning pregnancy; lack of appropriate implant sites (recent
scars, history of keloids); coagulopathy within 90 days;
screening serum aspartate and alanine aminotransferase lev-
els 3-fold higher than upper limits of normal; total bilirubin
or creatinine levels 1.5-fold higher than upper limits of nor-
mal; clinically significant thrombocytopenia; use of strong
cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (azole antifungals, macro-
lide antibiotics, or protease inhibitors) or an anticoagulant;
chronic pain requiring opioids; AIDS; significant medical
problems potentially affecting volunteer safety if enrolled;
primary diagnosis of substance dependence other than opi-
oids or nicotine; or pending legal action or other factors/
conditions that could adversely affect participant safety and
adequate adherence.
Intervention Groups
Using a centralized computer system for blinded allocation,
participants were randomized 1:1 within a block size of 4 with-
out stratification to daily sublingual buprenorphine tablets
(dosage same as prerandomization; Amneal Pharmaceuti-
cals) with 4 placebo subdermal implants or daily sublingual
placebotabletswith4activebuprenorphineimplants.Fourim-
plants were expected to yield plasma buprenorphine concen-
trations (0.5-1.0 ng/mL) at a range comparable with 8 mg/d or
lessofsublingualbuprenorphine.Basedonindependentanaly-
sis of 1-year insurance data for a cohort exclusive of patients
takingmultipleopioidmedications,approximately25%ofper-
sonsreceivingbuprenorphinemaintenancetherapyforatleast
1 year receive sublingual buprenorphine, 8 mg/d or less
(Suboxone equivalents). Placebo and sublingual buprenor-
phine tablets matched in appearance.
On randomization day, implant insertion was performed
during an approximate 10- to 15-minute in-office procedure.
Followinglocalanestheticinjection,4subdermalimplantswere
inserted one at a time through a single 2.5- to 3-mm incision
in the inner upper arm using an applicator designed for the im-
plants. The incision was closed with steri-strips and a pres-
sure bandage was applied for 24 hours. To maintain blinding,
Key Points
Question Are 6-month subdermal buprenorphine implants
noninferior to daily sublingual buprenorphine in maintaining
clinical stability among currently stable opioid-dependent adults
receiving buprenorphine maintenance therapy (�8 mg/d) who
have not used illicit opioids in the last 90 days?
Findings In this double-blind, double-dummy randomized clinical
trial (n = 177), the proportion of responders (�4 of 6 months
without illicit opioid use) was 96.4% with buprenorphine implants
vs 87.6% with sublingual buprenorphine, demonstrating statistical
noninferiority.
Meaning Buprenorphine implants may be an effective relapse
prevention treatment for stable opioid-dependent adults
maintaining clinical stability with 8 mg/d or less of sublingual
buprenorphine.

staff involved in implant insertion and removal at 6 months
did not participate in study evaluation as active and placebo
implants varied slightly in appearance. Unblinded supplemen-
tal sublingual buprenorphine use (2-mg tablets; Actavis
Elizabeth LLC) was allowed as needed during the study.
Participantassessmentsoccurredatweek1,thenat4-week
intervals. Urine samples were obtained for drug testing at
scheduled monthly visits and 4 times randomly for a total of
10 urine samples. Study follow-up was conducted by tele-
phone 1 week posttreatment; a follow-up visit was scheduled
for 2 weeks posttreatment. All participants received manda-
tory manual-guided individual drug counseling during each
monthly study visit.16 Participant-requested or physician-
directed supplemental visits, telephone calls, or additional
counseling; supplemental sublingual buprenorphine or other
pharmacological interventions; and reasons for each were re-
corded.Medicationadherencewascapturedthroughvisualin-
spection and palpation of each subdermal implant and via pill
counts at study visits.
Outcome Measurements and Patient Assessments
Efficacy outcome analyses were based on the predefined in-
tention-to-treat population consisting of all randomized par-
ticipants who received study medication and provided any ef-
ficacy data. The primary efficacy end point was the difference
in proportion of responders, defined as participants with at
least4of6monthswithoutevidenceofillicitopioiduse(based
on urine test and self-report composites) by treatment group.
Illicit drug use was measured by urine testing and self-
report.Urinesamples,adjustedforcreatininelevel,werequan-
titatively analyzed for opioids (codeine, morphine, hydroco-
done,oxymorphone,hydromorphone,oxycodone,methadone,
and fentanyl) using liquid chromatography–tandem mass
spectrometry and qualitatively tested for other drugs of abuse
(cocaine, barbiturates, amphetamines, phencyclidine, and tet-
rahydrocannabinol). Self-report of illicit opioid use and other
drugs of abuse was recorded using a Timeline Followback
interview17 on an illicit drug use self-report form. When both
urine samples and self-report were negative for opioids within
the reporting month, the assessment was considered opioid
negativeforevaluationoftheprimaryefficacyendpoint;either
an opioid-positive urine test result or self-reported opioid use
qualified as an opioid-positive assessment.
Secondary efficacy analyses included treatment reten-
tion, time to first illicit opioid use, percentage of illicit opioid
usebymonth,andcumulativepercentageofnegativeillicitopi-
oid urine results at 6 months. Opioid craving, withdrawal, and
supplemental use of sublingual buprenorphine were also mea-
sured. Safety—based on adverse event reporting, including im-
plant site reactions—was assessed in all participants receiv-
ing study medication.
Opioid craving was determined through self-reported “de-
siretouse”and“needtouse,
”measuredwithunipolar100-mm
visual analog scales ranging from 0 (no desire or need to use)
to 100 (strongest possible desire or need to use).18 Opioid with-
drawal measures included the Subjective Opioid Withdrawal
Scale(SOWS)andClinicalOpioidWithdrawalScale(COWS).19,20
Outcomes were completed at screening, day 1, and monthly.
For demographic data collection, participants designated
their race/ethnicity based on investigator-defined options.
Statistical Analysis
Analyses followed the statistical analysis plan (Supplement)
developed in collaboration with and approved by the US
Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The study tested non-
inferiority of buprenorphine implants relative to sublingual
buprenorphine on the primary efficacy outcome, with nonin-
feriority established for a lower bound of the 95% confidence
interval greater than −0.20 within the intention-to-treat
population (1-sided testing with a significance threshold of
P < .025). Per FDA statistical guidance for noninferiority
trials, once noninferiority criteria were met, a nonprespeci-
fied sequential χ2 test was performed for superiority.21 All
superiority analyses were 2-sided with a significance thresh-
old of P < .05. A sample size of 90 participants per group (180
participants overall) was selected to achieve 87.3% power
assuming a 75% responder rate for both treatment groups.
Missing urine test data were imputed by randomly generated
binary outcome (positive or negative for opioid use) using a
20% relative penalty against the buprenorphine implant
group based on urine test results from each group. Sensitivity
analyses were conducted, including analysis of the effect of
imputing all missing urine samples as opioid positive with
response defined as 6-month abstinence from illicit opioids
and adjudication of randomized participants who did not
provide any efficacy data as nonresponders.

For secondary efficacy analyses, variables based on per-
centage were analyzed by χ2; time to first evidence of illicit
opioid use was analyzed by log-rank test with treatment
effects. Changes from baseline in craving scale, SOWS, and
COWS scores were derived by subtracting baseline values
from postbaseline values; negative changes indicated
improvement. Changes from baseline were analyzed using
analysis of covariance with treatment and baseline effects
and via mixed-model repeated measures as a sensitivity
analysis. Adverse events were tabulated by treatment group
among all participants in the safety population. Commer-
cially available software (SAS version 9.2; SAS Institute Inc)
was used for all statistical analyses.
Results
Participants
Enrollment began in June 2014 and the study ended May
2015; 177 patients were randomized. One participant ran-
domized to sublingual buprenorphine did not receive study
medication; 3 participants randomized to buprenorphine
implants provided no study outcome data. The predefined
intention-to-treat population included 173 of 177 participants
(n = 89 sublingual buprenorphine; n = 84 buprenorphine
implants); 176 of 177 participants were included in the safety
population (Figure 1). In total, 84 of 90 participants receiving
sublingual buprenorphine and 81 of 87 with buprenorphine
implants completed the study. Table 1 shows participant
demographics and clinical characteristics.
Primary Outcomes
In the buprenorphine implant and sublingual buprenorphine
groups, 81 of 84 participants (96.4%) and 78 of 89 partici-
pants (87.6%), respectively, were responders. The difference
was 8.8% (1-sided 97.5% CI, 0.009 to �; P < .001 for noninfe-
riority; P = .03 for superiority) on the primary outcome mea-
sure, with a calculated number needed to treat of 11.36 vs sub-
lingual buprenorphine (Table 2).
In a sensitivity analysis for all randomized participants,
with all missing urine samples imputed as positive for opi-
oids and no illicit opioid use for all 6 months, 70 of 87 par-
ticipants (80.5%) receiving buprenorphine implants and 60
of 90 (66.7%) receiving sublingual buprenorphine were
abstinent, resulting in a proportion difference of 13.8%
(1-sided 97.5% CI, 0.010 to �; P < .001 for noninferiority).

Additional sensitivity analyses were consistent with primary
efficacy results (Table 2).
Secondary Outcomes
Evidence of Illicit Opioid Use in Urine and by Self-Report
Relative to sublingual buprenorphine, a larger proportion of
participants receiving buprenorphine implants demonstrated
no evidence of illicit opioid use throughout 6 months of
treatment (Figure 2A). At 6 months, cumulative abstinence
was 72 of 84 (85.7%) for buprenorphine implants vs 64 of 89
(71.9%) for sublingual buprenorphine (hazard ratio, 13.8; 95%
CI, 0.018-0.258; P = .03), with a number needed to treat of
7.25. This statistically significant difference became apparent
starting at month 3 and was sustained throughout month 6.
Time to first evidence of illicit opioid use was significantly
longer for buprenorphine implants relative to sublingual
buprenorphine (hazard ratio, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.25-.97; P = .04)
(Figure 2B).
Measures of Craving
There was no significant difference in desire-to-use scores for
participants receiving buprenorphine implants or sublingual
buprenorphine at baseline (Table 1) or at end of treatment
(P = .83) (Table 2). The need-to-use scores were similar at base-
line (Table 1) between buprenorphine implant and sublingual
buprenorphine groups and at end of treatment (P = .51)
(Table 2).
Measures of Withdrawal
Baseline COWS scores were low for participants receiving bu-
prenorphine implants and sublingual buprenorphine (Table 1),
with no statistically significant changes from baseline to end
of treatment (P = .92) (Table 2). Baseline SOWS scores were low
for participants receiving buprenorphine implants and sub-
lingual buprenorphine (Table 1), with no changes from base-
line to end of treatment (P = .43) (Table 2).
Supplemental Use
Supplemental sublingual buprenorphine was permitted as
needed throughout the study as determined by the treating
physician. Fifteen participants with buprenorphine implants
(17.9%) and 13 given sublingual buprenorphine (14.6%) re-
ceived supplemental medication (P > .05) (Table 2). In both
groups, the majority of participants receiving supplemental
medication were prescribed small dosages (2 mg/d) on 4 or
fewer occasions within the 6-month period.
Safety
Serious adverse events occurred in 5 participants, 3 in the sub-
lingual buprenorphine group (biliary colic, chronic cholecys-
titis, bronchitis) and 2 in the buprenorphine implant group
(convulsions, worsening bipolar I disorder). One buprenor-
phine implant participant discontinued because of an ad-
verse event (muscle spasms).
Medication-relatedandimplant-relatedadverseeventswere
consistent with the known safety profile of buprenorphine22
andthepreviouslypublishedimplantationprocedure14(Table3).
Buprenorphine implants were associated with higher inci-
dences of local site adverse events vs sublingual buprenor-
phine. In addition to implant-related or non–implant-related
adverse events, 1 accidental pediatric tablet exposure oc-
curred in the sublingual buprenorphine group, resulting in
overnight hospitalization and notification of local child pro-
tective services. Two participants receiving sublingual bu-
prenorphine were admitted to inpatient rehabilitation. In each

In part A, each month’
s evidence of opioid use is added to the next month
so that by month 6, any evidence of opioid use from months 1 through 6 is
included; patients shown in month 6 had no illicit opioid use between months 1
and 6. The median duration of the study for patients treated with
buprenorphine implants or sublingual buprenorphine was 26.1 weeks. For
participants treated with buprenorphine implants, the treatment duration
ranged from 7.3 to 31.6 weeks (interquartile range, 25.9-26.4 weeks); for
participants treated with sublingual buprenorphine, the treatment duration
ranged from 6.0 to 28.9 weeks (interquartile range, 25.9-26.7 weeks).

Discussion
Because there are limited data on patients stable on sublin-
gualbuprenorphine,23itisimportanttostudymaintenanceand
improvement of stability in patients who achieve good clini-
cal response to initial buprenorphine treatment. In this study,
buprenorphine implants were noninferior to sublingual bu-
prenorphine for the primary end point of at least 4 of 6 months
with no illicit opioid use by drug testing and self-report among
opioid-dependentadultsmaintainingclinicalstabilitywithsub-
lingual buprenorphine. Additionally, relative to participants
using sublingual buprenorphine, participants receiving bu-
prenorphine implants were more likely to sustain abstinence
from illicit opioids from month 3 through month 6. At a
6-month cumulative end point, 85.7% of the buprenorphine
implant group was abstinent relative to 71.9% of the sublin-
gualbuprenorphinegroup,providinganumberneededtotreat
of 7.25. To our knowledge, this was the first comparative trial
to evaluate efficacy and safety of 6-month buprenorphine im-
plants relative to sublingual buprenorphine in this understud-
ied population of patients clinically stable taking sublingual
buprenorphine.
Buprenorphine is an effective treatment for opioid
dependence4,7,8,10; however, adherence to daily dosing for
managementofchronicdisordersischallenging.24Animplant-
able buprenorphine delivery system reduces adherence is-
sues and may improve efficacy. Furthermore, buprenorphine
implants may reduce the need for sublingual buprenorphine,
decreasing its availability for diversion, misuse,23 and harms
such as accidental pediatric exposure.25 This study demon-
strated the efficacy of buprenorphine implants in treatment
of patients maintaining clinical stability with sublingual bu-
prenorphine in comparison with an active control; prelimi-
nary evidence of efficacy relative to placebo was previously
demonstrated by reducing opioid use in patients initiating
buprenorphine treatment in double-blind, phase 3, placebo-
controlled trials.13,14
Although very few participants experienced relapses to
opioid use during the 24 weeks of the study, statistically sig-
nificant differences in time to first illicit opioid use between
the buprenorphine implant and sublingual buprenorphine
groups demonstrated sustained abstinence (Figure 2A).
Despite a conservative method applying a 20% relative pen-
alty for imputing missing urine values to the buprenorphine
implant group, a 14% difference in illicit opioid-free urine
samples was present at 6 months. These results were main-
tained in further sensitivity analyses (Table 2). These data
support long-term maintenance of clinical stability provided
by buprenorphine implants relative to the current standard,
sublingual buprenorphine.

Transition from sublingual buprenorphine to the implant
was clinically nondisruptive, obviating concerns regarding
increases in opioid withdrawal, craving, need, or desire to
use. The majority of study participants did not require
supplemental sublingual buprenorphine, although more par-
ticipants with buprenorphine implants received supplemen-
tal medication relative to the sublingual buprenorphine
group. In prior studies, supplemental buprenorphine use
was higher among patients new to treatment and receiving
buprenorphine implants.14 This is likely due to differences
in the sample enrolled and is also reflected in retention
rates; the current study retained 93.1% of participants
compared with a lower retention in buprenorphine treat-
ment (64%-66%) in studies enrolling participants new
to treatment.13,14
A limitation of this study was that it was not powered to
detect differences in adverse outcomes. Additionally, gener-
alizabilityofthestudyfindingsmaybelimitedbecausethema-
jority of the participants enrolled were white, employed, with
at least a high school education, and dependent on prescrip-
tion opioids. The population enrolled herein may demon-
strate a demographic shift in opioid use disorder and differs
from the traditional population in clinical studies of partici-
pants new to treatment, such as those recruited in prior stud-
ies of buprenorphine implants.13,14 This study included clini-
callystableparticipantswhomaintainedabstinencefor90days
prior to randomization and were in buprenorphine treatment
for an average of 3.5 years. These factors may account for the
higherthananticipatedresponserateinthecontrolgroup(88%
vs 75% in power analysis).
A question for future study includes determining the rate
and predictors of relapse after implant discontinuation. Many
patients wish to discontinue sublingual buprenorphine follow-
ing a few months of maintenance, perhaps because of unreal-
istic expectations,26 subjecting them to significant risk of
relapse.27Maintenancedosagesofsublingualbuprenorphineap-
pear to be inversely associated with risk of opioid relapse after
cessation.28 Thus, it is important to study the feasibility of
longer-term patient treatment with 6-month implant replace-
ment. Additionally, larger trials could address infrequent but
clinicallyandsocietallyimportantpublichealthadverseevents,
including accidental pediatric exposure, and more common
events associated with buprenorphine, such as diversion.
Conclusions
Among adults with opioid dependence maintaining absti-
nence with a stable dose of sublingual buprenorphine, the use
of buprenorphine implants compared with continued sublin-
gual buprenorphine did not result in an inferior likelihood of
remaining a responder. However, the study population had an
exceptionally high response rate in the control group, and fur-
ther studies are needed in broader populations to assess the
efficacy of buprenorphine implants vs sublingual buprenor-
phine in other settings.
