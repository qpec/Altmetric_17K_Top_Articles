Physical activity can help delay, prevent, or manage many of 
the chronic diseases for which adults aged ≥50 years are at risk 
(1–3). These diseases can impact the length and quality of life, 
as well as the long-term ability to live independently.* All adults 
aged ≥50 years, with or without chronic disease, gain health 
benefits by avoiding inactivity (2,3). To examine the preva-
lence of inactivity by selected demographic characteristics and 
chronic disease status in mid-life and older adults, CDC ana-
lyzed data on adults aged ≥50 years from the 2014 Behavioral 
Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). Overall, 27.5% of 
adults aged ≥50 years reported no physical activity outside of 
work during the past month. Inactivity prevalence significantly 
increased with increasing age and was 25.4% among adults 
aged 50–64 years, 26.9% among those aged 65–74 years, and 
35.3% among those aged ≥75 years. Inactivity prevalence was 
significantly higher among women than men, among Hispanics 
and non-Hispanic blacks than among non-Hispanic whites, 
and among adults who reported ever having one or more of 
seven selected chronic diseases than among those not reporting 
one. Inactivity prevalence significantly increased with decreas-
ing levels of education and increasing body mass index. To help 
adults with and without chronic disease start or maintain an 
active lifestyle, communities can implement evidence-based 
strategies, such as creating or enhancing access to places for 
physical activity, designing communities and streets to encour-
age physical activity, and offering programs that address specific 
barriers to physical activity.
BRFSS is a state-based, random-digit–dialed telephone sur-
vey of the noninstitutionalized U.S. civilian population aged 
≥18 years. Data were collected among 304,129 adults aged 
≥50 years from the 50 states and the District of Columbia 
(DC). The 2014 median landline and cellphone combined 
response rate was 47.0%, and ranged from 25.1% to 60.1%.†
Inactivity is defined as participating in no activity beyond 
baseline activities of daily living (2,3). For this analysis, inac-
tivity was operationalized as a “no” response to the question, 
“During the past month, other than your regular job, did you 
participate in any physical activities or exercises such as running, 
calisthenics, golf, gardening, or walking for exercise?” In addi-
tion to self-reported sex, age, race/ethnicity, and highest level of 
education completed, adults reported weight and height. Body 
mass index (BMI) was calculated (weight [kg]/height [m]2), 
and adults were classified as underweight or normal weight 
(<25.0 kg/m2), overweight (25.0–29.9 kg/m2) or obese 
(≥30 kg/m2) (4). Questions about seven chronic diseases for 
which recommendations for physical activity in preventing 
or treatment of the disease are well-established were included 
in analyses (2,3,5). Respondents were defined as ever having 
one of these selected chronic diseases if they responded “yes” 
to a question asking if a doctor, nurse, or other health care 
professional ever told them they had the specific condition 
(stroke, coronary heart disease, arthritis, cancer [excluding 
skin cancer], diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 
and depressive disorder). Ever having coronary heart disease 
was defined as a “yes” response to myocardial infarction or 
coronary heart disease.
Data were analyzed by selected demographic characteristics 
and weighted to provide overall prevalence estimates with 
accompanying 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Linear contrasts 
and pairwise t tests were used to identify significant trends and 
differences by subgroups. Only differences and trends that 
reached statistical significance (p<0.05) were reported. Multiple 
logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the adjusted 
prevalence ratio (aPR) after controlling for the potential con-
founding effects from the following characteristics: sex, age 
group, race/ethnicity, education level, and BMI category. By 
using the multiple logistic regression model, the prevalence in 
activity by each characteristic controlled for the effects from 
the remaining characteristics in which studies have shown 
to be associated with inactivity. Statistical software was used 
to account for the complex sampling design and to provide 
weighted estimates.
Among the 304,129 adults aged ≥50 years living in the 50 
states and DC, data from 27,210 adults were excluded because 
of missing information, resulting in a final sample of 276,919 
adults. Overall, 27.5% of U.S. adults aged ≥50 years, approxi-
mately 31 million persons, were inactive (Table). Inactivity 
increased with increasing age for adults aged 50–64 years 
(25.4%), 65–74 years (26.9%), and ≥75 years (35.3%). The 
prevalence of inactivity was higher for women (29.4%) than 
men (25.5%), and for Hispanics (32.7%) and non-Hispanic 
blacks (33.1%) than non-Hispanic whites (26.2%) and those 
of other race/ethnicity (27.1%). The prevalence decreased

from 44.1% to 14.2% with increasing levels of education and 
increased from 23.1% to 35.8% with increasing BMI category. 
Differences in prevalence of inactivity by sex, age group, race/
ethnicity, education level, and BMI category remained after 
simultaneously adjusting for these characteristics.
By region, the prevalence of inactivity was highest in 
the South (30.1%), followed by the Midwest (28.4%) and 
Northeast (26.6%). The West (23.1%) had the lowest preva-
lence. After adjusting for demographic characteristics, differ-
ences in prevalence by region remained. Among the 50 states 
and DC, the prevalence ranged from 17.9% in Colorado to 
38.8% in Arkansas (Figure 1).
Among those who ever had one of the seven chronic dis-
eases, the prevalence of inactivity was higher among those 
who ever had any of the diseases compared with those who 
did not (Table). The magnitude of the difference ranged from 
an aPR of 1.1 (CI = 1.1–1.2) for cancer to an aPR of 1.5 
(CI = 1.5–1.6) for chronic obstructive lung disease. Overall, 
more adults reporting at least one chronic disease were inac-
tive (31.9%) compared with those not reporting any (19.2%) 
(Figure 2). The demographics-adjusted prevalence of inactivity 
among adults with at least one chronic disease was 40% higher 
(aPR = 1.4; CI = 1.3–1.4) compared with adults without a 
chronic disease. By age group, the prevalence of inactivity for 
adults with at least one chronic disease compared with those 
with no disease was 30.9% versus 18.1% for 50–64 years, 
29.6% versus 19.2% for 65–74 years, and 37.3% versus 26.8% 
for ≥75 years (Figure 2).
Discussion
Approximately 28% of adults aged ≥50 years (31 million 
persons) were inactive. Inactivity increased with increasing 
age and BMI, and decreased with increasing levels of educa-
tion. The prevalence of inactivity was higher among women 
than among men, and among Hispanics and non-Hispanic 
blacks compared with non-Hispanic whites. The prevalence 
was 10%–50% higher among adults who reported having had 
one of seven specific chronic diseases than among those who 
reported not having it. The prevalence among the 50 states 
and DC ranged from 18% to 39%. Results of this analysis are 
consistent with findings from a national survey showing these 
differences by demographic characteristics§ and by chronic 
disease status (6).
Older adults might be inactive for a number of reasons. 
Despite benefits of physical activity, it might be that some 
adults with chronic diseases become inactive because of the 
disease. However, according to 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines 
for Americans (2,3), older adults and adults with chronic 
diseases or disabilities should try to engage in physical activity 
appropriate for their abilities. Among those with a chronic dis-
ease, physical activity can help lessen their condition’s severity, 
manage the disease, or prevent or delay other chronic diseases. 
For example, among persons with arthritis, joint pain could 
be reduced through being more active; low impact activity is 
often recommended (2,3).
Similar to persons with disabilities, older adults might want 
to be active but face barriers, such as limited places to be 
safely active in their community or not knowing how to be 
active given their physical limitations (7). Communities can 
provide supports that help everyone become more active by 
using recommended evidence-based strategies.¶ These com-
munity strategies were recently highlighted in Step It Up! The 
Surgeon General’s Call to Action to Promote Walking and Walkable 
Communities** and complement existing recommendations 
and initiatives to help Americans become more physically 
active, such as Healthy People 2020, the National Prevention 
Strategy: America’s Plan for Better Health and Wellness, Let’s 
Move!, the Go4Life Campaign, the National Physical Activity 
Plan, and the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Safer 
People, Safer Streets Initiative.††

Communities can be enhanced and designed to make it 
safe and easy for persons of all ages and abilities to be active. 
Community design can support physical activity, for example, 
by locating residences within short walking distance of desti-
nations (e.g., stores) and building well-connected safe paths 
between destinations. Street design can support walking and 
enhance pedestrian safety through measures that improve safety 
and aesthetics, as well as addressing barriers for persons with 
limitations (e.g., using curb cuts). Currently, enhancing and 
designing communities to promote physical activity is sup-
ported in several federally funded programs.§§ For example, 
through the State Public Health Actions to Prevent and Control 
Diabetes, Heart Disease, Obesity and Associated Risk Factors 
and Promote School Health program,¶¶ CDC works with 
state departments of health to increase physical activity by 
increasing the number of communities that have pedestrian 
and bike-friendly master transportation plans.
Creating or enhancing access to places for physical activity, 
combined with information to promote and encourage use 
of these places, is another recommended strategy to increase 
physical activity. Examples of such community locations

include public parks, recreational facilities, senior centers, 
and malls. Programs, such as an organized mall walking 
program,*** can help enhance access and promote and 
encourage use of these locations.
Through campaigns and informational approaches, com-
munity groups and organizations can also provide access to 
evidence-based community programs to help adults start and 
continue to be physically active. Given higher levels of inac-
tivity among persons with chronic conditions, it is important 
that organizations offer programs that address specific concerns 
these adults might have and barriers they might face. For 
example, the Arthritis Foundation’s Walk With Ease program 
has been shown to reduce pain, increase balance and strength, 
and improve overall health through walking.††† Health care 
professionals can play a role in promoting physical activity by 
counseling patients, writing prescriptions for physical activity, 
and possibly referring them to community programs or facili-
ties where they can be active (8,9).§§§
Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Physical activity has health benefits for persons of all ages. When 
adults are not able to meet guidelines because of factors such as 
age, chronic disease, or disabilities, they should engage in 
physical activity according to their abilities; adults who partici-
pate in any physical activity will gain some health benefits. 
Communities can provide supports that help everyone become 
more active by using recommended evidence-based strategies.
What is added by this report?
Overall, 27.5% of adults aged ≥50 years reported no physical 
activity outside of work during the past month. Inactivity 
prevalence significantly increased with increasing age, and was 
25.4% among adults aged 50–64 years, 26.9% among adults 
aged 65–74 years, and 35.3% among adults aged ≥75 years. 
Inactivity prevalence was significantly higher among women 
than men, among Hispanics and non-Hispanic blacks than 
among non-Hispanic whites, and among persons reporting ever 
having had one or more of seven selected chronic diseases than 
among those not reporting one. Inactivity prevalence signifi-
cantly increased with decreasing levels of education and 
increasing body mass index.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Despite the many benefits of being physically active, approxi-
mately one in four adults aged ≥50 years are inactive. 
Communities can be designed and enhanced to make it safer and 
easier for persons of all ages and abilities to be physically active.

The findings in this report are subject to at least five limita-
tions. First, BRFSS data are self-reported and subject to recall 
and social-desirability biases. This can result in an underesti-
mate of physical inactivity (10). Second, BRFSS physical activ-
ity questions do not include occupational activities, and not 
considering a person’s work hours might result in overestimates 
of physical inactivity. Third, the data are from noninstitution-
alized adults and are not generalizable to the institutionalized 
population. Fourth, complete case analysis was used to handle 
missing data, which could result in an over- or underestimation 
of physical activity. Finally, the 2014 lowest state-level survey 
response rate was 25.1%, which can result in response bias. 
However, BRFSS data are weighted to adjust for nonresponse.
Approximately 28% of adults aged ≥50 years are inactive and 
are missing the opportunity to improve their health through 
physical activity. Communities can be designed and enhanced 
to make it safer and easier for persons of all ages and abilities 
to be physically active.
