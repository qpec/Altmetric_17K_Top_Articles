IMPORTANCE The Syrian civil war has resulted in large-scale devastation of Syria’
s health
infrastructure along with widespread injuries and death from trauma. The capacity of Syrian
trauma hospitals is not well characterized. Data are needed to allocate resources for trauma
care to the population remaining in Syria.
OBJECTIVE To identify the number of trauma hospitals operating in Syria and to delineate
their capacities.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS From February 1 to March 31, 2015, a nationwide survey
of 94 trauma hospitals was conducted inside Syria, representing a coverage rate of 69% to
93% of reported hospitals in nongovernment controlled areas.
MAIN OUTCOMES Identification and geocoding of trauma and essential surgical services in
Syria.
RESULTS Although 86 hospitals (91%) reported capacity to perform emergency surgery, 1 in 6
hospitals (16%) reported having no inpatient ward for patients after surgery. Sixty-three
hospitals (70%) could transfuse whole blood but only 7 (7.4%) could separate and bank blood
products. Seventy-one hospitals (76%) had any pharmacy services. Only 10 (11%) could
provide renal replacement therapy, and only 18 (20%) provided any form of rehabilitative
services. Syrian hospitals are isolated, with 24 (26%) relying on smuggling routes to refer
patients to other hospitals and 47 hospitals (50%) reporting domestic supply lines that were
never open or open less than daily. There were 538 surgeons, 378 physicians, and 1444
nurses identified in this survey, yielding a nurse to physician ratio of 1.8:1. Only 74 hospitals
(79%) reported any salary support for staff, and 84 (89%) reported material support. There
is an unmet need for biomedical engineering support in Syrian trauma hospitals, with 12 fixed
x-ray machines (23%), 11 portable x-ray machines (13%), 13 computed tomographic scanners
(22%), 21 adult (21%) and 5 pediatric (19%) ventilators, 14 anesthesia machines (10%), and
116 oxygen cylinders (15%) not functional. No functioning computed tomographic scanners
remain in Aleppo, and 95 oxygen cylinders (42%) in rural Damascus are not functioning
despite the high density of hospitals and patients in both provinces.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Syrian trauma hospitals operate in the Syrian civil war under
severe material and human resource constraints. Attention must be paid to providing
biomedical engineering support and to directing resources to currently unsupported and
geographically isolated critical access surgical hospitals.

A
s the Syrian civil war enters its fifth year of fighting, the
evolvingconflicthasclaimedhundredsofthousandsof
lives.Thewarhasresultedindisplacementofmorethan
10.8 million Syrians (4.28 million refugees,1 6.5 million inter-
nally displaced2), representing 49% of the estimated prewar
population. The urban warfare that has characterized the con-
flict has resulted in massive degradation of critical infrastruc-
ture, including electricity, clean water, sanitation, and public
health hospitals. In addition, it has been widely reported that
thetargetingofhealthcareprofessionalsandmedicalhospitals3
has led to a severe decline in public health as measured by life
expectancy, vaccination coverage, and infant mortality.4
Despite this level of devastation, hospitals continue to
function inside Syria to provide acute and emergency care for
the remaining population. The destruction of health care fa-
cilities through shelling and barrel bombing have forced some
hospitals to reconstitute in nondescript, fortified buildings,
such as former schools, underground garages, and ware-
houses.Thecapacitiesofthehospitalsvaryfromjustafewbeds
to a few large hospitals with 100 or more beds, from opera-
tive centers staffed by a single surgeon to multispecialty sur-
gicalunits,andfromhospitalsthatlackbasicmonitoringequip-
ment,suchaspulseoximeters,tothosewithintensivecareunit
and even tele–intensive care unit capabilities.
To plan for rational resource distribution and public health
coverage of the remaining population, clinicians and policy-
makers need to know the capacity, capabilities, and geo-
graphic distribution of critical health resources. The Union of
Medical Care and Relief Organizations (UOSSM), in coordina-
tionwithpartnerorganizationsthroughtheSyrianHospitaland
Acute Care Committee, conducted a nationwide survey of hos-
pitals that provide secondary surgical care or higher in re-
gions outside the control of the government in Damascus. By
identifying and geocoding clinically relevant services and
equipment, we seek to create a continually updated func-
tional capabilities map of trauma and essential surgical ser-
vices in Syria. Such information can be used by clinicians in
real time to decide how to treat patients, where to refer those
in need of specialty services, and how best to distribute criti-
cal resources. To our knowledge, this study represents the first
report of this project.
Methods
From February 1 to March 31, 2015, the UOSSM staff con-
ductedanationwidesurveyof94surgicalhospitalsinsideSyria
(Figure 1). The survey was conducted in Arabic, and we col-
lected data from each facility in the following domains: pa-
tient volume, services provided, presence and functionality
of diagnostic and therapeutic equipment, staffing levels, ac-
cessibility of patient transfer and resupply, and funding.
Trained data collectors familiar with hospitals in each re-
gion administered the survey. Data collectors visited each fa-
cility to directly observe operations and to visually inspect
equipment noted, when possible. A regional data supervisor
was responsible for collecting records, reviewing results, and
visiting a subset of hospitals to verify data collected.
This study of hospitals providing trauma care in Syria was
reviewed and approved by the Yale University Institutional Re-
view Board, and no informed consent was deemed necessary
because no identifiable information was collected.
Preliminary analyses were presented to a focus group of
nongovernmentalorganizationsandotherhealthstafffromin-
side Syria for their comment at a conference in Gaziantep, Tur-
key,inApril2015.Thefocusgroupnotedthatthecollecteddata
overestimated the number of surgical subspecialists in Syria.
The lack of consistent notation of level of effort, in terms of
days per week of subspecialist availability, prevented the ac-
curate identification of subspecialists because many pro-
vided services at more than 1 facility. Furthermore, despite the
distinction in the initial survey between subspecialists with
certification and surgeons providing subspecialty treatment
(eg, vascular repair) without official certification, such dis-
tinctionswerenotconsistentlyobservedbythehospitalsthem-
selves. As a result, data supervisors resurveyed hospitals re-
garding the presence or absence of surgeons as a group and

Key Points
Question What is the capacity to provide trauma care in Syria?
Finding Ninety-four hospitals provide operative trauma care
inside Syria, with 538 surgeons, 378 other physicians, and 1569
nurses of any kind providing care for 12 million people in April 2015
(nongovernment, non–Islamic State territory). There is an unmet
need for biomedical engineering support, with large numbers of
critical equipment in need of repair, and trauma volume is high,
with a mean (SD) of 228 (305) patients presenting monthly to
Syrian hospitals.
Meaning Hospitals are operating under severe human and
material resources constraints to provide trauma care during the
Syrian Civil War.

nonsurgeon physicians as a group, along with their respec-
tive level of effort and training.
Key clinical services (eg, ability to provide blood transfu-
sionorphysiotherapyforinjuredpatients)wereevaluatedwith
respect to their presence and availability (eg, full time, part
time, or not reported) at each facility. Only services that were
fully functional were considered present. For example, if a he-
modialysis machine was present but another critical compo-
nent, such as dialysate or a dialysis technician, was missing,
then this service was coded as not available.
The status of critical diagnostic and therapeutic equip-
ment was recorded in the survey to characterize the function-
alityanddistributionofmedicalequipment(Figure2).Foreach
class of equipment, the total number present at each facility
and the number of functional and nonfunctional devices were
recorded to establish the need for biomedical engineering sup-
port at Syrian trauma hospitals. Devices were grouped by func-
tion to establish the ability at each facility to perform specific
services. For example, operating theaters were assessed to
identifywhethertheyhadafunctioningoperatingtheaterlight,
operating table, suction, cautery, anesthesia device, and abil-
ity to monitor patients intraoperatively.
Survey responses were recorded digitally in Microsoft Ex-
cel spreadsheets (Microsoft Corporation) then exported to
STATA statistical software, release 14 (StataCorp), for analy-
sis. Out of concern for hospital safety, hospitals were georef-
erenced using coordinates that did not represent exact loca-
tionbutwerewithinneighborhoodsorsubdistrictsoftheactual
hospital. Results were mapped for spatial display and analy-
sis. No identifying information was collected on individual pa-
tients, and all health service data collected were summary in
nature.
Results
In all, 94 hospitals that provided operative trauma care ser-
vices responded to the survey; their characteristics are re-
ported in Table 1. Almost all hospitals were open and staffed 7
daysaweek(mean[SD],6.9 [0.3]days),with80(85%ofallhos-
pitals and 89% of those reporting) reporting operating hours
greater than 12 hours daily (the maximum category). The prov-
inces with the greatest number of responses were Rural Da-
mascus (25 [27%]) and Dar’
a (19 [20%]) in the south and Idleb
(21 [22%]) in the north, reflecting density of surgical hospitals
and ease of accessibility for data collectors in these regions.
Hospitals reported a great degree of functional and geo-
graphic isolation. Although the mean distance was 18.7 km to
the nearest similar facility and 10.5 km to the referral facility,
the large SDs reported reflected several hospitals with much
further distances from nearby centers. In addition, 24 hospi-
tals (26%) reported having to use smuggling routes for pa-
tient transfers, 47 hospitals (50%) reported domestic supply
routes (within Syria) that were never open or open less than
daily, and 65 hospitals (68%) reported international supply
routes (to nearest border) that were never open or open less
than daily. The mean distance from each facility to where they
receivedsupplieswas32km,withmanyhospitalsdenselyclus-
tered; however, some hospitals were geographically isolated
as represented by the SD of 65 km.
Eighty-eight hospitals (98%) reported having a surgical
emergency department, and 86 (91%) reported having fully
functioning emergency surgical capabilities. One in 6 hospi-
tals (16%) functioned as an emergency surgical center only and
reported having no adult inpatient ward to monitor patients
postoperatively. Furthermore, although 63 hospitals (70%) re-
ported the ability to bank whole blood, only 7 hospitals (7%)
reported functional transfusion services capable of separat-
ing and storing blood constituents and cross-matching blood
fortransfusion(Table2).Outpatientserviceswerelimited,with
31 hospitals (38%) with fully functional outpatient clinics, 18
(20%) with physiotherapy services for injured patients, and
10 (11%) with ability to provide renal replacement therapy.
Availability of surgical subspecialty services could not be
analyzed because many hospitals reported the presence or ab-
sence of a specialist without specifying his or her level of ef-
fort. In April 2015, there were 538 surgeons of any type (mean,
5.5 specialists and 0.8 surgical trainees per facility) and 378
nonsurgical physicians (mean, 2.8 specialists and 0.9 resi-
dents) working at 94 surgical hospitals surveyed throughout
Syria (Table 3). Allied health care professionals were present
in greater numbers, with 1569 nurses (mean, 9.8 professional
nurses and 7.2 trainee nurses per facility) and 1043 techni-
cians (mean, 9.6 professional technicians and 2.7 trainee tech-
nicians per facility) in this study. The mean (SD) number of
emergency patients per surgeon per month was 41 (54). The
mean (SD) number of emergency patients per physician per
month was 26 (35). The mean (SD) nurse to physician ratio was
1.71 (1.2). A total of 44 health care professionals (49%) re-
ceived in-hospital training or continuing medical education.
There were large numbers of nonfunctional critical diag-
nostic equipment (eTable 1 in the Supplement). Importantly,
12fixedx-raymachines(23%),11portablex-raymachines(13%),
and 13 computed tomographic scanners (22%) were not func-
tioning (eTable 2 in the Supplement). In addition, 21 adult ven-
tilators (21%), 5 pediatric ventilators (19%), 14 (10%) anesthe-
sia machines, and 116 (15%) oxygen cylinders were not
functioning (eTable 2 in the Supplement). There were no func-
tioning computed tomographic scanners in hospitals report-
ing from the Aleppo province, and 95 oxygen cylinders (42%)
in the Rural Damascus province are nonfunctional, despite the
high density of surgical hospitals and critically high number
of patients in both areas.
Laboratory diagnostic services were limited. Overall, al-
though most hospitals (82 [87%]) reported the ability to deter-
minehematocritorhemoglobinlevelsandtoconductcrudeABO
testing for blood type, both crucial in patients with hemor-
rhagic injuries, 27 hospitals (29%) could not crossmatch blood,

Discussion
The results of this study, to our knowledge, provide the most
comprehensive report of the functional status of hospitals pro-
viding trauma care in Syria and illustrate the gaps in human
and material resources that can guide policymakers in allo-
cating scarce resources for major trauma care in Syria. Two
other hospital surveys were conducted in Syria in 2014-2015
but with a slightly different focus, specifically, the Health Re-
sources Availability Management System (HeRAMS)5 and the
HealthFacilitiesRapidAssessment(HeFRA).6Eachofthesesur-
veys assessed the capacity and functional status of health hos-
pitalsbuttendedtogroupfunctions(eg,laboratory)ratherthan
reportdiscretefunctions(eg,transfusionservices),specificser-
vices (eg, neurosurgical), or specific equipment (eg, com-
puted tomographic scanner or incubator) that may be a criti-
cal resource and have direct clinical significance. The HeRAMS
survey provided data on a wide variety of parameters for all
types of health care hospitals inside Syria by surveying non-
governmental organizations on behalf of hospitals they sup-
port. The HeFRA survey conducted field visits to hospitals di-
rectly to assess functionality, case load, and infrastructure.
Despite the existence of these surveys, the lack of detail re-
garding clinical characteristics of hospitals hampered the use
of their findings in guiding acute trauma and surgical care in
the field. Clinicians remained in the dark as to how to access
critical services or where to transfer patients to receive spe-
cialty care. This issue is especially problematic given the high
degree of insecurity involved in transferring patients in an ac-
tive war zone and where communication among hospitals is
the exception, not the rule.
Although it is difficult to ascertain the precise number of
trauma hospitals operating in Syria, the HeRAMS survey iden-
tified 135 hospitals providing secondary or tertiary trauma sur-
gical service,5 and the HeFRA survey identified 101 hospitals
with at least 1 operating theater.6 Use of such broad inclusion
criteria without ascertaining the degree to which these hos-
pitals were providing actual trauma care overestimates the
capacity for trauma care in Syria. Both previous surveys
(HeRAMS and HeFRA), as well as this study, provide data on

hospitals in the extreme north and south of Syria (accessible
from bordering countries). Although the HeFRA survey pro-
vided more details about hospitals in eastern Syria (currently
under Islamic State control), it does not contain data on hos-
pitals in the interior of the country. Assuming all hospitals re-
corded in prior surveys were still functional at the time of this
study, our survey can be estimated to cover 69% to 93% of
known hospitals in regions outside government control.
There is a crisis in human resources for health in Syria, but
that burden is unevenly distributed across hospitals in this sur-
vey. Although the original survey instrument collected data on

Inaddition,25%to30%ofhealthcareprofessionalsineach

number of emergency procedures during the past 4 years.
There is a need for a provisional competency-based certifica-
tion that can certify proficiency in certain critical functions so
that these health care professionals may be better integrated
into the health care system as a whole. For example, a resi-
dent in vascular surgery or a specialist in general surgery who
has become proficient at bypass grafting of traumatically in-
jured vessels may be provisionally credentialed under such a
scheme and could be recognized officially as a person to whom
patients in need of specialty surgery could be referred. De-
gree- and diploma-based certification cannot be the rule in this

emergency situation in which human resources for health are
so severely strained. More granular competency-based train-
ing and certification are urgently needed in Syria.
Although many hospitals in the north and south of the
country reported adequate numbers of total surgeons, geo-
graphically isolated hospitals in the central region had criti-
cal shortages of personnel in all categories. Hospitals re-
ported provision of some specialty services (eg, orthopedic)
despite a lack of specialists. Thus, it was unclear whether in
these instances there were specialists who provided care on
an intermittent basis or whether a limited spectrum of ser-
vices (eg, splinting or external fixation) were being provided
by nonspecialists. Future surveys should more carefully de-
fine key services (eg, emergency obstetric surgery, emer-
gencygeneralsurgeryforappendicitis)anddocumentwhorou-
tinely provides these services.
Themeannursetophysicianratioof1.71:1isjustmorethan
half the recommended ratio of 3:1 to 4:1 and much lower than
the 5:1 ratio in the SPHERE minimum guidelines for humani-
tarian response.7 This ratio is an overestimate of true func-
tional capacity of these hospitals because many nurses in this
calculation are laypersons who have received little training
within hospitals to provide basic nursing tasks and do not have
the full repertoire of skills of a professional nurse. This criti-
cal shortage is exacerbated by the extreme conditions under
which physicians and nurses operate inside Syria.
In addition, there is an unmet need for biomedical engi-
neering in Syria. Large numbers of critical diagnostics and
therapeutic devices are nonfunctional. Some are degraded and
simply require routine maintenance, such as the replace-
ment of a fuse. Given the critical needs for life-saving equip-
mentandtheexorbitantexpenseandriskoftransportinggoods
into and around Syria, hospitals in Syria urgently need bio-
medical engineering support for the repair and maintenance
of existing medical devices. This support may be more cost-
effective than additional procurement. Such support would le-
verage existing devices and allow local redistribution to more
effectively cover hospitals and populations inside Syria.
This survey highlighted a lack of transfusion services in
Syria. Blood banks exist but are not uniformly distributed
across Syria. Despite available crossmatching capability, an-
ecdotalevidenceindicatesthattheprocedureissimplynotper-
formed. Although blood transfusions take place daily in as-
tounding numbers, it is almost entirely locally donated whole
blood, with few hospitals having the human resources or tech-
nicalcapacityforseparation,storage,andtestingofbloodprod-
ucts. Indeed, in the April 2015 focus group discussion, it be-
came apparent that stock-outs and supply-chain disruptions
forced many hospitals to transfuse blood without even rudi-
mentary testing for viral contamination of hepatitis or hu-
man immunodeficiency virus. Future efforts should focus on
ensuring safety of patients receiving transfused blood in Syria.
Although these results give an important view of the ca-
pabilities of trauma hospitals inside Syria, future surveys
should seek to add additional details regarding hospitals’abil-
ity to provide key emergency surgical services as outlined in
previously standardized instruments, as in the World Health
Organization Tool for Situational Analysis to Assess Emer-
gency and Essential Surgical Care.8
As in any cross-sectional survey, these results reveal the
situation of Syrian hospitals at a single point in time. In highly
dynamic situations, such as the Syrian Civil War, with mobile
populations and heavy warfare in urban centers, human and
physicalresourcesarelikelytohavechanged—evenbythetime
of this article’
s publication. Nevertheless, the results of this
study can help guide future interventions to improve surgi-
cal services in the country. Future iterations of this survey may
add information about trends over time.
These data are only representative of the 94 hospitals that
responded to the survey. Estimates from other surveys of
health care facilities indicate the presence of 110 to 150 surgi-
cal centers that provide any form of trauma care.5,6 Findings
may only be generalizable for regions such as the north and
south of the country, where most respondent hospitals exist.
The results have limited generalizability to isolated hospitals
in the center of the country. Furthermore, hospitals in the east
of Syria that once reported data to this hospital committee and
that are now in regions controlled by the self-proclaimed Is-
lamic State are no longer reliably reached by data collectors.
As such, little can be predicted from these data as to the cur-
rent state of those hospitals.
Patient volumes reported by hospital administrators were
not in line with documentation from trauma data reported in-
dependently by those hospitals. Actual observed trauma pa-
tient volumes (for 59 hospitals where such data were avail-
able) were thus used to calculate the mean number of patients
per clinician. Future surveys should focus on drawing from
clinicalrecordsandgeneratingreliableestimatesofpatientvol-
ume and derived measures of patients per clinician and for
planning resource distribution.
Conclusions
Trauma hospitals inside Syria continue to provide massive
amountsoftraumaandemergencysurgicalcareeveryday.Hu-
man resources are strained, and additional study is needed to
more carefully map the availability of critical medical ser-
vices and resources in the country. There is a need for com-
petency-based training and credentialing to allow a number
of partially trained specialists to be accessed by the commu-
nity for subspecialty care. Finally, there is an unmet need for
biomedical engineering that can access the untapped re-
source of idle life-saving equipment.
