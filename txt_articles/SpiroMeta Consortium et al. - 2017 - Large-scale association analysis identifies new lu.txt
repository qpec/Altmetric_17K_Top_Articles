Summary 
While several lung cancer susceptibility loci have been identified, much of lung cancer 
heritability remains unexplained. Here, 14,803 cases and 12,262 controls of European descent 
were genotyped on the OncoArray and combined with existing data for an aggregated GWAS 
analysis of lung cancer on 29,266 patients and 56,450 controls. We identified 18 susceptibility 
loci achieving genome wide significance, including 10 novel loci. The novel loci highlighted the 
striking heterogeneity in genetic susceptibility across lung cancer histological subtypes, with four 
loci associated with lung cancer overall and six with lung adenocarcinoma. Gene expression 
quantitative trait analysis (eQTL) in 1,425 normal lung tissues highlighted RNASET2, 
SECISBP2L and NRG1 as candidate genes. Other loci include genes such as a cholinergic 
nicotinic receptor, CHRNA2, and the telomere-related genes, OFBC1 and RTEL1. Further 
exploration of the target genes will continue to provide new insights into the etiology of lung 
cancer. 
 
Text. 
Lung cancer continues to be the leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide1. Although tobacco 
smoking is the main risk factor, the heritability of lung cancer has been estimated at 18%2. 
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified several lung cancer susceptibility loci 
including CHRNA3/5, TERT, HLA, BRCA2, CHEK2 and several more3,4, nevertheless most of 
its heritability remains unexplained. With the goal of conducting a comprehensive 
characterization of common lung cancer genetic susceptibility loci, we undertook 
additional genotyping of lung cancer cases and controls using the OncoArray5 genotyping 
platform, which queried 517,482 SNPs chosen for fine mapping of susceptibility to 
common cancers as well as for de novo discovery (Supplementary Table 1, and Online 
methods). All participants gave an informed consent and each study obtained local ethics 
committee approval and after quality control filters (Online Methods), a total of 14,803 cases 
and 12,262 controls of European ancestry were retained and underwent imputation techniques 
to infer additional genotypes for genetic variants included in the 1000 Genomes Project data 
(Online Methods). Logistic regression was then used to assess the association between 
variants (n=10,439,017 SNPs) and lung cancer risk, as well as by predominant histological 
types and by smoking behaviour (Online Methods). Fixed-effects models (Online Methods) 
were used to combine the OncoArray results with previously published lung cancer GWAS3,4,6, 
 7 
 
allowing for analysis of 29,266 patients and 56,450 controls of European descent (Table 1). 
There were no signs of genomic inflation overall or for any subtypes (Supplementary  
Figure 1) indicating little evidence for confounding by cryptic population structure (Online 
methods). All findings with a P-value less than 1x10-5 are reported in Supplementary  
Table 2. As shown in Figure 1, the genetic architecture of lung cancer varies markedly among 
histological subtypes, with striking differences between lung adenocarcinoma and squamous cell 
carcinoma. Manhattan plots for small cell carcinoma (SCLC), ever and never smoking are 
displayed in Supplementary Figure 2. The array heritability estimates were comparable among 
histological subsets, but squamous cell carcinoma appeared to share more genetic architecture 
with small cell carcinoma (SCLC) than with adenocarcinoma (Supplementary Table 3). 
 
Table 2 presents summary results of all loci with sentinel variants (defined as the variant with the 
lowest P-value at each locus) that reached genome-wide significance (P-value < 5x10-8) for lung 
cancer overall and by histological subtypes. Sentinel variants stratified by new and previous 
genotyping and additional statistical significance assessed based on the number of effective 
tests, Approximate Bayes Factors, and Bayesian False Discovery Probability are presented in 
Supplementary Table 4 and 5, respectively. Repeat genotyping of 12% of the OncoArray 
genotyped samples confirmed the fidelity of the genotyping or imputation for the risk loci, and 
showed excellent concordance of imputation for SNPs with MAF>0.05 (Online methods, 
Supplementary note). Among the 18 loci that reached GWAS significance, 10 had not reached 
significance in a genome-wide scan (Figure 1). Of these, four novel loci were associated with 
lung cancer overall and six with adenocarcinoma. 
 
To decipher the association between these 18 loci and lung cancer risk, we further investigated 
their association with gene expression level in normal lung tissues (n=1,425) (Supplementary 
Table 6, Supplementary Figure 3), genomic annotations (Supplementary Table 7) smoking 
propensity (cigarettes smoked per day (n=91,046) and Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence 
metrics (n=17,074)) (Table 2). Previous studies have shown shared risk for lung cancer and 
COPD through inflammation and ROS pathways7; therefore, we also assessed the association 
between   sentinel SNPs and reduced lung capacity through spirometry measurements (forced 
expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV1], forced vital capacity [FVC], n =30,199) (Table 2 and 
Online Methods).

Variants at 4 novel loci (1p31.1, 6q27, 8p21, 15q21.1) were associated with lung cancer risk 
overall, with little evidence for heterogeneity among subtypes (Supplementary Figure 4). The 
1p31.1 locus, recently identified in a pathway-based analysis of the TRICL data8, represented by 
rs71658797 (Odds Ratio [OR]=1.14, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 1.09-1.18, P-value=3.25 x 
10-11), is located near FUBP1/DNAJB4 (Supplementary Figure 4). At 6q27, rs6920364 was 
associated with lung cancer risk with an OR of 1.07 (95% CI 1.04-1.09, P-value=2.9x10-8) with 
little heterogeneity found by smoking status (Supplementary Figure 4). This locus is predicted 
to regulate RNASET2 (Supplementary Figure 5, Supplementary Table 7). We identified 
rs6920364 as a lung cis-eQTL for RNASET2, an extracellular ribonuclease, in all five cohorts 
tested (Supplementary Table 6), with increased lung cancer risk correlating with increased 
RNASET2 expression (Figure 2). Variants correlated with rs6920364 (r2>0.88) have been 
noted in GWAS of Crohn’s disease and inflammatory bowel disease9-13. 
 
The 8p21 locus has been suggested as a lung cancer susceptibility locus by pathway analysis14 
and now confirmed at GWAS significance level. It is a complex locus represented by sentinel 
variant rs11780471 associated with lung cancer (OR=0.87, 95% CI 0.83-0.91, P-
value=1.69x10-8) (Supplementary Figure 4) but this region contained additional uncorrelated 
variants (pairwise r2< 0.10) associated with lung cancer (Supplementary Table 8). Multivariate 
analysis was consistent with multiple susceptibility alleles at this locus (Supplementary Table 
8). In contrast to lung tissue (Figure 3A, Supplementary Table 6, Supplementary Figure 3), 
we noted that the alleles associated with lung cancer tended to be associated with cerebellum 
expression of CHRNA2, a member of the cholinergic nicotinic receptor (Figure 3B). The 
CHRNA2 rs11780471 cis-eQTL effect in the brain was limited to the cerebellum (Figure 3C), 
a region not traditionally linked with addictive behaviour but where an emerging role is 
suggested15. We therefore investigated rs11780471 in the context of smoking behaviour 
(Supplementary Methods). Unlike the well- described 15q25.1 (rs55781567) CHRNA5 locus 
(Table 2), rs11780471 was not associated with number of cigarettes smoked per day or the 
FTND metrics (Figure 3D). Nevertheless, lung cancer risk allele carriers of rs11780471 
tended to be smokers and initiated smoking at earlier ages (Figure 3D), implying that this 
variant’s association with lung cancer could potentially be mediated via influencing aspects of 
smoking behaviour.  Another potentially relevant gene in this region is EPHX2, a xenobiotic 
metabolism gene.

The genetic locus at 15q21 (rs66759488) was shown to be associated with lung cancer 
(OR=1.07, 95% CI 1.04-1.10, p=2.83x10-8) overall and across lung cancer histologies 
(Supplementary Figure 4). Genomic annotation suggests that genetic variants correlated with 
rs66759488 may influence the SEMA6D gene (Supplementary Table 7), but there was no clear 
eQTL effect (Supplementary Table 6) and this variant did not appear to have a major influence 
on smoking propensity or lung function (Table 2). 
 
For specific lung cancer histology subtypes, we identified 6 novel loci associated with lung 
adenocarcinoma (15q21, 8p12, 10q24, 20q13.33, 11q23.3 and 9p21.3) (Table 2). The locus at 
15q21 (rs77468143, OR=0.86, 95% CI 0.82-0.89, p=1.15x10-16) is predicted to target 
SECISBP2L (Supplementary Figure 5) and expression analysis indicated rs77468143 to be a 
cis-eQTL for SECISBP2L in lung tissue in all eQTL cohorts tested (Supplementary Table 6). 
The genetic risk allele appears to correlate with decreased expression levels of SECISBP2L 
(Figure 2, Supplementary Figure 5), an observation that is consistent with SECISBP2L being 
down regulated in lung cancers16. rs77468143 was nominally associated with lung function 
(Table 2), potentially implicating inflammation of lung as part of the mechanism at this locus. 
 
At 8p12, expression analysis indicated that the alleles associated with lung adenocarcinoma 
(represented by the sentinel variant rs4236709 (Table 2)), also appear to be a lung cis-eQTL for 
the NRG1 gene (Supplementary Table 6, Supplementary Figure 5). This region also contains 
putative regulatory regions (Supplementary Figure 5). Somatic translocations of NRG1 are 
infrequently observed in lung adenocarcinomas17. While somatic translocations at 8p12 generally 
take place in never smokers and linked with ectopic activation of NRG1, rs4236709 was 
associated with lung cancer in both ever and never smokers (Supplementary Figure 4) and its 
genetic risk correlated with decreased NRG1 expression (Figure 2). Interestingly, 6q22.1 variants 
located near ROS1, another gene somatically translocated in lung adenocarcinoma and in which 
nearby germline variants have been associated with never smoking lung adenocarcinoma in 
Asian women18, were associated with lung adenocarcinoma at borderline genome wide 
significance (rs9387479; OR=0.92, 95% CI 0.89-0.95, p=6.57x10-8) (Supplementary Table 2). 
 
Three of sentinel variants associated with lung adenocarcinoma are located near genes related to 
telomere regulation; rs7902587 (10q24) and rs41309931 (20q13.33) near OBFC1 and RTEL1, 
 1
0 
 
respectively, and rs2853677 near TERT as previously noted19,20. The variants at 10q24 associated 
with lung adenocarcinoma also appear associated with telomere length (Supplementary Figure 
6). By contrast, and consistent with observations with 20q13.33 variants associated with 
glioma 21, the variants associated with telomere length at 20q13.33 were not necessarily those 
associated with lung adenocarcinoma (Supplementary Figure 6). Nevertheless, more generally 
the variants associated by GWAS with longer telomere length22 appear linked with risk of 
lung adenocarcinoma23 and glioma21,24, a finding consistent with our expanded analysis here 
(Supplementary Figure 6). 
 
We additionally identified a complex locus at 11q23.3. The sentinel variant rs1056562 
(OR=1.11, 95% CI 1.07-1.14, p=2.7x10-10) is more prominently associated with lung 
adenocarcinoma (Supplementary Figure 4). rs1056562 was correlated with expression of two 
genes at this locus, AMICA1 and MPZL3 (Supplementary Table 6). However, there did not 
appear to be a consistent relationship between the alleles related with AMICA1 and MPZL3 
gene expression and those with lung adenocarcinoma (Figure 2, Supplementary Table 9), 
suggesting that expression of these genes alone is unlikely to mediate this association. 
 
 
At 9p21.3 we identified rs885518 that appeared to be associated with lung adenocarcinoma 
(OR=1.17, 95% CI 1.11-1.23, p=6.8x10-10). 9p21.3 is a region containing CDNK2A and 
variants associated with multiple cancer types, including lung cancer. Nevertheless, rs885518 
is located approximately 200kb centromeric the previously described variants (Supplementary 
Figure 4) and shows little evidence for LD (all pairwise r2< 0.01) with rs1333040, a variant 
previously associated with lung squamous cell carcinoma3 and rs62560775, another variant 
suggested to be associated with lung adenocarcinoma25 that we confirm to genome significance 
here. Intriguingly, these variants appear to confer predominant associations with different lung 
cancer histologies suggesting that they are independent associations (Supplementary Figure 7). 
 
Aside from the clear smoking-related effects on lung cancer risk through the CHRNA5 and 
CY
P2A6 regions and association with CHRNA2 noted above, the rest of variants we have 
identified do not appear to clearly influence smoking behaviors (Table 2), implying that these 
associations are likely mediated by other mechanisms. Nevertheless, there is shared genetic 
architecture between smoking behavior and lung cancer risk, consistent with the notion that 
 11 
 
genetic   variants   do   influence   lung   cancer   risk   also   through   behavioural   mechanisms 
(Supplementary Figure 8). 
In conclusion, the genetic susceptibility alleles we describe here explain approximately 12.3% of 
the familial relative risk previously reported in family cancer databases26,27, out of which 
3.5% was accounted for by the novel loci. Our findings emphasize striking heterogeneity 
across histological subtypes of lung cancer. We expect that further exploration of the related 
target genes of these susceptibility loci, as well as validation and identification of new loci, 
will continue to provide insights into the etiology of lung cancer.

Figure 1. Manhattan plots of lung cancer risk overall and by histological subtypes. (a) lung 
cancer risk overall, 29,266 cases and 56,450 controls (b) adenocarcinoma, 11,273 cases and 
55,483 controls (c) squamous cell carcinoma 7,426 cases and 55,627 controls. Each locus is 
annotated by their cytoband locations. The X�axis represents chromosomal locations and the Y�
axis represents -log10(P�value). Black denotes the previously known loci and Red denotes the 
new loci identified in this analysis 
 
 
Figure 2. Scatter plots comparing variants across the 6q27, 15q21.1, 8p12 and 11q23.3 
susceptibility loci and (Y-axis) their associated with lung cancer (or lung adenocarcinoma, 
as relevant) and (X-axis) the lung cis–eQTL (GTEx). Each variant (dot) is colored relative the 
degree of linkage disequilibrium (r2) with sentinel lung cancer variant (marked) at that locus. 
Indented table, association between sentinel variant and lung cancer (or histological subtype) as 
well as the eQTL evidence in lung epithelium for the microarray (Laval, UBC, Groningen) and 
RNAseq (NCI and GTEx) cohorts. At 6q27, 15q21.1 and 8p12, the variants associated with lung 
cancer also tend to be those that that are lung cis-eQTL’s for RNASET2, SECISBP2L and NRG1, 
respectively. At 11q23.3, while the sentinel variant (rs1056562) is a lung cis-eQTL for AMICA1, 
additional variants are AMICA1 lung cis-eQTL’s but not associated with lung adenocarcinoma 
and vice versa suggesting an alternate candidate gene may be responsible for this association or a 
pleiotropic effect at this locus.

axis) and CHRNA2 eQTL (X-axis) in lung epithelial tissues (panel a) and CHRNA2 eQTL in 
brain cerebellum tissues (panel b). Panel C. eQTL association between rs11780471 across 
tissues from different parts of the brain from GTEx and Braineac consortia noting CHRNA2 cis- 
eQTL effect appears restricted to the brain cerebellum. Panel D. Association between 
rs11780471 and smoking phenotypes, noting evidence for association between smoking status 
(ever vs never) and age of initiation, with lung cancer risk allele carriers (G) more likely to be 
ever smokers and take up smoking earlier. Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND)

Online methods 
This work is conducted based on the collaboration of Transdisciplinary Research of Cancer in Lung of the 
International Lung Cancer Consortium (TRICL-ILCCO) and the Lung Cancer Cohort Consortium (LC3). The 
participating studies are individually described in the Supplementary Note. 
 
OncoArray genotyping. 
Genotyping was completed at the Center for Inherited Disease Research (CIDR), the Beijing Genome 
Institute, the HelmholtzCenter Munich (HMGU), Copenhagen University Hospital, and the University of 
Cambridge. Quality control steps follow the approach described previously for the OncoArray5 
(Supplementary Note).  
 
Genotype quality control. 
After removing the 1,193 expected duplicates, QC procedures for the 43,398 individuals are 
summarized in Supplementary Note Figure 1. Standard quality control procedures (detailed in the 
Supplementary Note) were used to exclude underperforming individuals (number of DNAs=1,708) and 
genotyping assays (judged by success rate, genotype distributions deviated from that expected by Hardy 
Weinberg equilibrium, number of variants=16,149). After filtering, there were 517,482 SNPs available 
for analysis.  
 
Identity by Descent (IBD) was calculated between each pair of samples in the data using PLINK to 
detect unexpected duplicates and relatedness. Details are described in Supplementary Note. 340 
unexpected duplicated samples (proportion IBD>0.95) and 940 individuals were removed as related 
samples with proportion IBD between 0.45 and 0.95. Of these, 721 of them were expected first 
degree relatives. In total, 0.56% of the total samples were removed as unexpected duplicates or 
relatives in the QC analysis. We additionally considered the potential that more distant familial 
relationships could have impacted the results. However, further restriction to proportion IBD > 0.2 
identified 139 second degree relatives and excluding these had minimal impact on the association 
results (Supplementary Note Table 1). 
 
Complete genotype data for X chromosomes were used to verify reported sex by using PLINK sex 
inference and a support vector machine procedure resulting in 306 non concordant samples being 
removed (Supplementary Note).  
 
We used the program FastPop (http://sourceforge.net/projects/fastpop/)28 was used to identify 5,406 
individuals of non-European ancestry (Supplementary Note) resulting in a n  final association analysis 
including 14,803 lung cancer cases and 12,262 controls.  
 
We confirmed the fidelity genotyping (directly and imputed) of the OncoArray platform by considering 
concordance of these genotypes relative to genotypes obtained from analogous genotyping platform 
(Supplementary Note). 
 
Imputation analysis. 
A detailed description of the imputation procedures used by the OncoArray consortium and in this Lung 
 20 
 
Oncoarray project, has been described previously.5   Briefly, the reference Dataset was the 1000 
Genomes Project (GP) Phase 3 (Haplotype release date October 2014). The forward alignment of SNPs 
genotyped on the Oncoarray was confirmed by blasting the sequences used for defining SNPs against 
the 1000 Genomes. Any ambiguous SNPs were subjected to a frequency comparison to 1000 Genomes 
variants. Allele frequencies were calculated  from a large collection of control samples from Europeans 
(from 108,000 samples) and Asians (11,000 samples). A difference statistic is calculated by the formula: 
(|p1-p2|- 0.01)^2/((p1+p2)(2-p1-p2)) where p1 and p2 are the frequencies our dataset and in the 1000 
genomes respectively5. A cutoff of 0.008 in Europeans and 0.012 in Asians is needed to pass.  SNPs 
where the frequency would match if the alleles were flipped were excluded from imputation but not 
from the association analyses.5    AT/GC SNPs were not present in previously genotyped lower density 
arrays. Because all imputation was performed to the same standard all SNPs had the same orientation 
at the time of imputation. The OncoArray whole genome data were imputed in a two-stage procedure 
using SHAPEIT to derive phased genotypes, and IMPUTEv229 to perform imputation of the phased data. 
We included for imputation only the more common variant if more than one variant yielded a match at 
the same position. The detailed parameter settings are in the Supplementary Note.  
 
 
Meta analysis of lung cancer GWAS. 
FlashPCA30 was run for principal component analysis (PCA) to infer genetic ancestry by genotype. 
The regression model assumed an additive genetic model and included the first three eigenvalues 
from FlashPCA as covariates. For imputed data of smaller sample size, which was enrolled in our 
analysis later, we changed the method score to EM algorithm to accommodate smaller sample size. 
 
We combined imputed genotypes from 14,803 cases and 12,262 controls from the OncoArray series with 
14,436 cases and 44,188 controls samples undertaken by the previous lung cancer GWAS 3,4,6, including 
studies of IARC, MDACC, SLRI, ICR, Harvard, NCI, Germany and deCODE as described previously3,4,6 , and 
we ensured that there were no overlap between the ATBC, EAGLE and CARET studies included in both 
the previous GWAS and current OncoArray dataset by comparing the identity tags (IDs) of all study 
participants. 
 
In addition to lung cancer, histological strata (adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, small cell 
carcinoma (SCLC) and smoking status (Ever/Never) was assessed where data were available.  Additional 
details on subsets that were used are available upon request. 
 
We conducted the fixed effects meta-analysis with the inverse variance weighting and random effects 
meta-analysis from the DerSimonian-Laird method 31. All meta-analysis and calculations were performed 
using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). As the same referent panel was used for all 
studies, all SNPs showed the same forward alignment profiles. We excluded poorly imputed SNPs 
defined by imputation quality Rsq < 0.3 or Info < 0.4 for each meta-analysis component and SNPs with a 
Minor allele frequency (MAF) >0.01 (except for CHEK2 rs17879961 and BRCA2 rs11571833 which we 
have validated extensively previously4. We generated the index of heterogeneity(I2) and P-value of 
C�������� Q statistic to assess heterogeneity in meta-analyses and considered only variants with little 
 21 
 
evidence for heterogeneity in effect between the studies (P-value of C�������� Q statistic >0.05). SNPs 
were retained for study provided the average imputation R-square was at least 0.4. For SNPs in the 
0.4-0.8 range that reached genome wide significance results were evaluated for consistency with 
neighboring SNPs to assure a reliable inference. Due to the smaller sample size and fewer sites 
contributing in the strata of Never Smokers and SCLC, we additionally required variants to be present in 
each of the meta-analysis components to be retained for these 2 stratified analyses. 
 
Conditional analysis was undertaken using SNPTEST where individual level data was available and 
GCTA32 packages for the previous lung cancer GWAS, with the LD estimates obtained from individuals of 
European origin for the later. Results were combined using fixed effects inverse variance weighted 
meta-analysis as described above33. 
 
Assessing Statistical Significance 
Genome wide statistical significance was considered at P-values of 5X10-8 or lower, but we also 
presented significance per alternative criteria following Bonferroni correction for the number of 
effective tests or Bayesian False Discovery Probability (BFDP) described below. 
 
To evaluate the effective number of tests we used the Li and Ji (2005)33 method which performs an 
initial step of filtering out SNPs with MAF<0.01 (imputation is less reliable for these and power is also 
limited for most odds ratios). Among the 4,751,148 markers with that MAF there were 1,182,363 
effective tests. 
 
The BFDP combines significance level, study power, and cost of false discovery and non-discovery into 
consideration. The detailed procedures of this method are described in Wakefield, 200734.  Essentially, 
the approximate Bayes Factor (ABF) which BFDP uses reflects how much the prior odds change in the 
light of the observed data (i.e. relative probability of the observed estimates under the null versus 
alternative hypothesis). Given the nature of GWA studies, we applied a flat prior for all variants at prior 
probability of 10-6 and 10-8 to demonstrate the range of BFDP. 
 
Annotation of susceptibility loci. 
We combined multiple sources of in silico functional annotation from public databases to help identify 
potential functional SNPs and target genes, based on previous observations that cancer susceptibility 
alleles are enriched in cis-regulatory elements and alter transcriptional activity. The details are 
described in the Supplementary Note. 
 
eQTL analysis of lung cancer sentinel variants. 
To investigate the association between the sentinel variants and mRNA expression, we used three 
different eQTL datasets : (i) Microarray eQTL study:  The lung tissues for eQTL analyses were from 
patients who underwent lung surgery at three academic sites, Laval University, University of British 
Columbia (UBC), and University of Groningen. Whole-genome gene expression profiling in the lung was 
performed on a custom Affymetrix array (GPL10379). Microarray pre-processing and quality controls 
were described previously. Genotyping was carried on the Illumina Human 1M-Duo BeadChip array. 
Genotypes and gene expression levels were available for 409, 287 and 342 patients at Laval, UBC, and 
Groningen, respectively. (ii) NCI RNAseq eQTL study: RNA was extracted from lung tissue samples within 
 22 
 
the Environment and Genetics in Lung cancer Etiology (EAGLE) study.  RNAseq was carried out on 90 lung 
������ ������� ���� �� ���� ������� ���� ��� ����� �������� ���� �� ����-��������� ���� �������) to 
minimize the potential for local cancer field effects. Transcriptome sequencing of 90 non-tumor samples 
was performed on the Illumina HiSeq2000/2500 platform with 100-bp paired-end reads.  Genotyping 
was undertaken using Illumina bead arrays as described previously. (iii) GTEx: eQTL summary statistics 
based on RNAseq analysis were obtained for eQTL summary statistics from the GTEx data portal 
http://www.gtexportal.org/home/ 35. This data included 278 individuals with data from lung tissue.  
Details of these three eQTL studies are included in the Supplementary Note. 
 
The Microarray eQTL study was used as a discovery cohort. Probe sets located within 1 Mb up and 
downstream of lung cancer SNPs were considered for cis-eQTL analyses. We have also explored a 5 Mb 
interval for lung cancer-associated SNPs not acting as lung eQTL within the 1 Mb window. The top eQTL 
association for that sentinel variant (or if contained multiple eQTL's with P-value<0.0005 each was 
considered), this particular eQTL was then chosen and assessed specifically in the independent NCI and 
GTEx RNAseq eQTL datasets. Statistical significance was defined the eQTL surpassed a locus specific 
Bonferroni correlation in the discovery cohort (P-value=0.05/number of probes at that locus) and 
subsequently there was evidence for replication of the eQTL effect with that variant and gene within the 
validation cohorts (NCI/GTEx RNAseq).   
 
Lung cancer susceptibility variants in other phenotypes. 
We assessed associations between sentinel genetic variant associated with lung cancer and other 
phentoypes, including smoking behavior F��������� Test for Nicotine Dependence, lung function and 
telomere length. Additional details of these analyses for other phenotypes are described in 
Supplementary Note. Briefly: 
Smoking behaviors. 
The effects of lung cancer sentinel variants and smoking behavior were assessed based on the meta-
analysis across 3 studies:  ever-smoking controls with intensity information from the Oncoarray 
studies (N=8,120), deCODE (N=40,882) and UK Biobank (N=42,044). The association with nicotine 
dependence was evaluated based on F��������� Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND) data collected 
in 4 studies (n=17,074):  deCODE Genetics, Environment and Genetics in Lung Cancer Etiology 
(EAGLE), Collaborative Genetic Study of Nicotine Dependence (COGEND), and Study of Addiction: 
Genetics and Environment (SAGE) and among current smokers in one other study [Chronic 
Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Gene (COPDGene). The study-specific SNP association results were 
combined using fixed effects, inverse variance-weighted meta-analysis with genomic control applied.  
Specifically for the 8p21 variant rs11780471, we additionally considered other aspects of smoking 
behavior data from UKBiobank, deCODE and OncoArray controls. We additionally included summary 
statistics for the rs11780471 variants from the TAG consortium (described in detail in the 
Supplementary Note). 
Lung function. 
The lung function in silico look up was conducted in SpiroMeta consortium, which included 38,199 
European ancestry individuals. The genomewide associations between genetic variants and forced 
expiratory volume in ���econd (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC) and FEV1/FVC with 1000 Genomes 
 23 
 
Project (phase 1)-imputed genotypes in the GWAS with 38,199 individuals36.   
Telomere Length (TL). 
Sentinel genetic variants associated with telomere length were those described by Codd et al22. 
Telomere lengths in 6,766 individuals from the UK Studies of Epidemiology and Risk Factors in Cancer 
Heredity (SEARCH) study controls using a real-time PCR methodology and genotyping as described in 
Pooley et al., 201337.  
 
Genetic heritability and correlations. 
Genome-wide SNP heritability and correlation estimates were obtained using association summary 
statistics and linkage disequilibrium (LD) information through LD Score (LDSC) regression analyses 38,39. 
These analyses were restricted to HapMap3 SNPs with minor allele frequency above 5% in European 
populations of 1000 Genomes. Association summary statistics used for these analyses were based on 
lung cancer histological/smoking types (lung cancer overall, adenocarcinoma, squamous cell, small cell, 
ever smokers and never smokers) and smoking behavior parameters (cigarettes per day (CPD), smoking 
status (ever vs never smokers), and smoking cessation (current vs former smokers) from TRICL-ILCCO 
OncoArray consortium and Tobacco And Genetics consortium 
(https://www.med.unc.edu/pgc/downloads)40. 
 
Estimating the percentage of familial relative risks explained 
The familial relative risk to a first degree relative accounted for by an individual variant (denoted as �i) is 
estimated based on relative risk per allele and allele frequency for that variant, using the method 
described in Hemminki et al41, and Bahcall42, under the assumption of log-additive effect. Assuming the 
effects of all susceptibility variants combined multiplicatively and not in linkage disequilibrium, the 
combined effect ��T) can then be expressed as the product of all �i. The proportion of the familial 
relative risk attributable to the totality of the susceptibility variants can then be computed as 
�����T�������P).  For lung cancer, the �P is approximately 2.0 based on the family cancer databases26,27. 
The percentage reported is based on the 18 sentinel variants reported in Table 2. The multiple 
independent alleles in the same locus are not accounted for in this estimation.
