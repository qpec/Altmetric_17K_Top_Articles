Summary
Background The use of transvaginal mesh and biological graft material in prolapse surgery is controversial and has 
led to a number of enquiries into their safety and effi
  cacy. Existing trials of these augmentations are individually too 
small to be conclusive. We aimed to compare the outcomes of prolapse repair involving either synthetic mesh inlays 
or biological grafts against standard repair in women.
Methods We did two pragmatic, parallel-group, multicentre, randomised controlled trials for our study (PROSPECT 
[PROlapse Surgery: Pragmatic Evaluation and randomised Controlled Trials]) in 35 centres (a mix of secondary and tertiary 
referral hospitals) in the UK. We recruited women undergoing primary transvaginal anterior or posterior compartment 
prolapse surgery by 65 gynaecological surgeons in these centres. We randomly assigned participants by a remote web-
based randomisation system to one of the two trials: comparing standard (native tissue) repair alone with standard repair 
augmented with either synthetic mesh (the mesh trial) or biological graft (the graft trial). We assigned women (1:1:1 or 1:1) 
within three strata: assigned to one of the three treatment options, comparison of standard repair with mesh, and 
comparison of standard repair with graft. Participants, ward staff
 , and outcome assessors were masked to randomisation 
where possible; masking was obviously not possible for the surgeon. Follow-up was for 2 years after the surgery; the 
primary outcomes, measured at 1 year and 2 years, were participant-reported prolapse symptoms (i.e. the Pelvic Organ 
Prolapse Symptom Score [POP-SS]) and condition-specifi
 c (ie, prolapse-related) quality-of-life scores, analysed in the 
modifi
 ed intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered as an International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial, 
number ISRCTN60695184.
Findings Between Jan 8, 2010, and Aug 30, 2013, we randomly allocated 1352 women to treatment, of whom 1348 were 
included in the analysis. 865 women were included in the mesh trial (430 to standard repair alone, 435 to mesh 
augmentation) and 735 were included in the graft trial (367 to standard repair alone, 368 to graft augmentation). 
Because the analyses were carried out separately for each trial (mesh trial and graft trial) some women in the standard 
repair arm assigned to all treatment options were included in the standard repair group of both trials. 23 of these 
women did not receive any surgery (15 in the mesh trial, 13 in the graft trial; fi
 ve were included in both trials) and 
were included in the baseline analyses only. Mean POP-SS at 1 year did not diff
 er substantially between comparisons 
(standard 5·4 [SD 5·5] vs mesh 5·5 [5·1], mean diff
 erence 0·00, 95% CI –0·70 to 0·71; p=0·99; standard 5·5 [SD 5·6] 
vs graft 5·6 [5·6]; mean diff
 erence –0·15, –0·93 to 0·63; p=0·71). Mean prolapse-related quality-of-life scores also did 
not diff
 er between groups at 1 year (standard 2·0 [SD 2·7] vs mesh 2·2 [2·7], mean diff
 erence 0·13, 95% CI 
–0·25 to 0·51; p=0·50; standard 2·2 [SD 2·8] vs graft 2·4 [2·9]; mean diff
 erence 0·13, –0·30 to 0·56; p=0·54). Mean 
POP-SS at 2 years were: standard 4·9 (SD 5·1) versus mesh 5·3 (5·1), mean diff
 erence 0·32, 95% CI –0·39 to 1·03; 
p=0·37; standard 4·9 (SD 5·1) versus graft 5·5 (5·7); mean diff
 erence 0·32, –0·48 to 1·12; p=0·43. Prolapse-related 
quality-of-life scores at 2 years were: standard 1·9 (SD 2·5) versus mesh 2·2 (2·6), mean diff
 erence 0·15, 95% CI 
–0·23 to 0·54; p=0·44; standard 2·0 (2·5) versus graft 2·2 (2·8); mean diff
 erence 0·10, –0·33 to 0·52; p=0·66. 
Serious adverse events such as infection, urinary retention, or dyspareunia or other pain, excluding mesh 
complications, occurred with similar frequency in the groups over 1 year (mesh trial: 31/430 [7%] with standard repair 
vs 34/435 [8%] with mesh, risk ratio  [RR] 1·08, 95% CI 0·68 to 1·72; p=0·73; graft trial: 23/367 [6%] with standard 
repair vs 36/368 [10%] with graft, RR 1·57, 0·95 to 2·59; p=0·08). The cumulative number of women with a mesh 
complication over 2 years in women actually exposed to synthetic mesh was 51 (12%) of 434.
Interpretation Augmentation of a vaginal repair with mesh or graft material did not improve women’s outcomes in 
terms of eff
 ectiveness, quality of life, adverse eff
 ects, or any other outcome in the short term, but more than one in 
ten women had a mesh complication. Therefore, follow-up is vital to identify any longer-term potential benefi
 ts and 
serious adverse eff
 ects of mesh or graft reinforcement in vaginal prolapse surgery.

Introduction
The use of transvaginal synthetic mesh and biological 
graft material in women having prolapse repair surgery 
has caused much controversy.1 The known high rate of 
further surgery after traditional prolapse surgery (30%),2 
and evidence that mesh insertion is an eff
 ective 
treatment for abdominal hernia surgery,3,4 led to the 
introduction of mesh for pelvic organ prolapse repair.
When our study PROSPECT (PROlapse Surgery: 
Pragmatic Evaluation and randomised Controlled Trials) 
began (in 2009), evidence from 17 randomised controlled 
trials (appendix) supported the use of mesh and grafts in 
terms of better anatomical cure of prolapse, but evidence 
for other outcomes was absent.5,6 Concerns have since 
been raised about the safety and morbidity of mesh and 
graft 
use 
in 
prolapse 
surgery, 
including 
pain, 
dyspareunia, and mesh-specifi
 c complications such as 
exposure within the vagina, extrusion and perforation.7 
These concerns led to increased litigation internationally, 
and in Scotland, UK (in June, 2014), a ban on the use of 
mesh until suffi
  cient reliable evidence becomes available 
to inform practice.8
A Cochrane review9 (published in 2016) of results from 
37 trials in 4023 women reported that women are less 
likely to have prolapse symptoms or measureable 
prolapse, and fewer require repeat prolapse surgery, after 
repairs with synthetic non-absorbable mesh than after a 
standard (native tissue) repair, but not enough reliable 
evidence was available to suggest whether women had 
better quality of life. However, the comparison of biological 
grafts with standard repairs remained inconclusive, and 
with the exception of mesh exposure and bladder injury, 
information about other adverse eff
 ects was insuffi
  cient. 
Furthermore, few trials reported results separately for 
women undergoing their fi
 rst or a repeat procedure.
Therefore we designed the PROSPECT study to 
compare the outcomes of prolapse repairs involving either 
non-absorbable synthetic mesh inlays (the mesh trial) or 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
The use of synthetic mesh and biological graft material in 
women having prolapse repair surgery has caused much 
controversy, and raised enquiries about the safety and effi
  cacy 
of these techniques. We undertook two secondary systematic 
reviews (Cochrane and IP) to identify all relevant evidence 
relating to the value of augmentation of prolapse surgery with 
synthetic absorbable or non-absorbable mesh or biological 
grafts. A Cochrane review of trials published in 2007 identifi
 ed 
seven that used mesh or grafts, of which only one included 
non-absorbable mesh in one arm (search date May 3, 2006). 
An Interventional Procedures review updated the Cochrane 
review by including a further ten trials (search date July 5, 2007).
Findings from only two small trials using grafts reported 
persistent prolapse symptoms; the data were too few to be 
reliable. However, women in four trials of biological graft versus 
standard (native tissue) repair were signifi
 cantly less likely to 
have residual objective prolapse (12% versus 22% of 
553 women: risk ratio [RR] 0·55, 95% CI 0·37–0·81; and 
similarly for non-absorbable mesh versus standard (6% versus 
28% of 369 women: RR 0·24, 0·13–0·43). Limitations of the 
trials, and hence the reviews, included an absence of distinction 
between women having a fi
 rst or a repeat procedure; 
additionally, very few included patient-reported outcomes such 
as prolapse, urinary, bowel, or sexual symptoms; quality of life; 
or adverse eff
 ects; or health-economic outcomes. And although 
a more recent Cochrane review has been published, containing 
37 trials, the quality of current evidence remains very low to 
moderate, due to poor reporting of study methods, 
inconsistency, and imprecision.
Added value of this study
Our study, PROSPECT (PROlapse Surgery: Pragmatic 
Evaluation and randomised Controlled Trials), was large with a 
low risk of bias that distinguished between women having a 
fi
 rst and a repeat procedure and used validated outcomes 
relevant to, and reported by, the participants. In the fi
 rst 
2 years after surgery, we showed that women do not benefi
 t 
from having their fi
 rst prolapse repair (either standard 
anterior or posterior repair) reinforced with synthetic mesh or 
biological graft, either in terms of prolapse symptoms or 
anatomical cure.
Implications of all the available evidence
Results of previous studies showed a benefi
 t from the use of 
synthetic mesh and biological graft on objective prolapse 
stage. However, there are important methodological 
limitations in aggregating the evidence from these studies 
using meta-analysis, including the quality of the evidence, the 
failure to diff
 erentiate between primary and secondary repairs, 
and paucity of patient-centred, validated prolapse-specifi
 c 
outcomes, or quality of life. Our large, rigorous study off
 ers 
strong, clinically relevant evidence for the alternative view: 
that mesh or graft are unlikely to be useful in terms of 
improving any symptoms of pelvic-fl
 oor dysfunction or 
women’s quality of life up to 2 years after surgery. Some 
women had treatment for mesh complications, although most 
mesh exposures were small and asymptomatic. Further 
long-term follow-up will ultimately determine whether the use 
of mesh or graft in vaginal prolapse repair provides any 
long-term benefi
 ts.

biological grafts (the graft trial) against standard repairs 
(native tissue without mesh or graft) in women having a 
primary anterior or posterior transvaginal repair. The 
primary focus was patient reported outcomes (women’s 
symptoms of prolapse) and their experience of adverse 
eff
 ects, in keeping with international recommendations.10,11
Methods
Study design and participants
For PROSPECT, we did two pragmatic, parallel-group 
randomised controlled trials in women undergoing 
primary transvaginal anterior or posterior compartment 
prolapse surgery in 35 centres (a mix of secondary and 
tertiary referral hospitals) in the UK. PROSPECT was 
approved by the North of Scotland Research Ethics 
Committee (09/SO802/56). The full protocol is available 
on the funders’ website.12 The planned surgery could 
include concomitant uterine, vault, or continence surgery. 
All women under the care of a collaborating surgeon 
were potentially eligible for inclusion if a decision had 
been made to have primary pelvic organ prolapse surgery 
for anterior or posterior vaginal wall prolapse.  Only 
women who were unable or unwilling to give informed 
consent, or who were unable to complete study 
questionnaires, were deemed ineligible. All women who 
required pelvic organ prolapse surgery were identifi
 ed by 
their surgeon or a dedicated recruitment offi
  cer in each 
centre.  They were given a study fl
 yer and a brief summary 
of the study at their initial clinic appointment, followed by 
the patient information leafl
 et with their admission 
documents or by separate mail if the woman agreed. 
Eligible surgeons had to be profi
 cient in transvaginal 
anterior and posterior prolapse repair (subspecialist 
urogynaecologists 
and 
special 
interest 
general 
gynaecologists). Women who were having a repeat repair 
(in the same compartment) and those who were not 
eligible for randomisation are not reported in this Article. 
All women provided written informed consent.
Randomisation
We randomly assigned participants by a remote web-
based randomisation system to one of the two trials: 
comparing standard (native tissue) repair alone with 
standard repair augmented with either synthetic mesh 
inlay (the mesh trial) or a biological graft inlay (the graft 
trial). A remote web-based randomisation application at 
the Centre for Healthcare Randomised Trials (CHaRT, 
University of Aberdeen, UK) was used for group 
allocation. Because not all surgeons could off
 er all three 
interventions (standard repair alone, standard repair 
with synthetic mesh, or standard repair with biological 
graft), women were randomly assigned (1:1:1 or 1:1) 
within three strata: A) women assigned to one of all three 
treatment options; B) comparison of standard repair with 
mesh; and C) comparison of standard repair with graft. 
We used a minimisation algorithm that included: age 
(<60 years or ≥60 years); type of prolapse repair planned 
(anterior, posterior, or both); need for a concomitant 
urinary continence procedure (eg, mid-urethral tape) or 
not; need for a concomitant upper vaginal prolapse 
procedure (eg, hysterectomy, cervical amputation, or 
vault repair) or not; and the operating surgeon.
Masking for the surgeon with respect to treatment 
allocated by randomisation was not feasible, but the 
participants and ward staff
  were not informed about the 
randomised allocation or the actual treatment received 
unless there was a clinical need or requested by the 
woman. The clinical examination at 1 year was done by 
an observer unaware of the allocated treatment where 
possible. 
Procedures
The participating surgeons (subspecialist uro 
gynaecologists 
and special interest general gynaecologists) used their 
usual surgical techniques for transvaginal mesh, graft, and 
standard (native tissue) repairs. They provided details of 
their surgical protocols, which could include midline or 
fascial plication if indicated, and could use any mesh or 
graft available to them. All surgeons doing mesh surgeries 
used non-absorbable type 1 monofi
 lament macroporous 
polypropylene mesh for inlays. The weights of mesh 
ranged from 19 g/m² to 44 g/m², and hybrid (coated) mesh 
was allowed. The biological graft materials were porcine 
acellular collagen matrix, porcine small intestinal 
submucosa, or bovine dermal grafts. The mesh or graft was 
inserted below the fascial layer if possible and secured with 
peripheral sutures.
We measured outcomes by participant-completed 
postal questionnaire at baseline (before surgery), and 
6 months, 1 year, and 2 years after surgery, and in a clinic 
review appointment at 1 year (with the Pelvic Organ 
Prolapse Quantifi
 cation system [POP-Q]).
Outcomes
The primary clinical outcome was the woman’s report of 
prolapse symptoms, in keeping with International 
Urogynecological Association/International Continence 
Society (IUGA/ICS) recommendations.11 At 1 year after 
surgery to assess this primary outcome we used the Pelvic 
Organ Prolapse Symptom Score (POP-SS), a validated 
patient-completed measure that has been shown to be 
sensitive to change after treatment.13,14 POP-SS contains 
seven items relating to frequency of prolapse symptoms 
in the preceding 4 weeks. Each item is scored from 
0 (never) to 4 (all the time), with a possible total score 
ranging from 0 to 28. The minimally clinically important 
diff
 erence of the POP-SS is two.15 A diff
 erence between 
groups in a mean score of 2 units would represent an 
improvement in the response to one POP-SS symptom 
question (for example, “a feeling of something coming 
down or in the vagina”, improved from most of the time 
to occasionally). We also used the POP-SS questions to 
defi
 ne subjective failure as POP-SS greater than 0 and 
any report of something coming down.

A second primary outcome was condition-specifi
 c 
quality of life measured using a visual analogue scale. 
Secondary outcomes were generic quality of life based on 
the EQ-5D-3L16 and adverse eff
 ects and complications of 
surgery using the IUGA/ICS complications classifi
 cation 
which includes type, severity, time of occurrence, and 
site.7,17 We also measured bladder, bowel, and sexual 
function using validated or adapted International 
Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaires (ICIQ) as 
secondary outcomes.18 
Objective measurement of prolapse stage using the 
Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantifi
 cation system (POP-Q) 
was undertaken by observers masked when possible to 
treatment allocated and received.19 We recorded if the 
person undertaking the POP-Q knew the treatment that 
they were randomly assigned to or the treatment 
actually received so we could monitor the situation, but 
accepted that masking was not always possible. 
Objective failure was defi
 ned as the leading edge of the 
prolapse beyond the hymen (>0 cm), in line with 
other research.20
Adverse eff
 ects, need for readmission or further 
treatment for adverse eff
 ects, or prolapse recurrence, 
were reported by surgeons or participants and verifi
 ed by 
study offi
  ce staff
  from a second source when possible. 
Serious adverse events were defi
 ned using standard 
classifi
 cations.21 All defi
 nitions are in keeping with the 
recommendations of IUGA, ICS, and the International 
Consultation on Incontinence.7,11,17,18,22
Statistical analysis
We planned to follow up 400 women in each of three arms 
(a total of 1200 participants) to detect a diff
 erence in the 
primary clinical outcome, POP-SS, of 0·25 SD (based on a 
SD of 8 and a minimally clinically important diff
 erence of 
two) with 90% power and α=0·025 (to maintain the 
nominal p value at 0·05 with tests for two comparisons).15 
The sample size was increased to 1450 women to allow for 
potentially 17·5% of them to drop out.

We did not follow up randomly assigned participants 
who did not receive any surgery. Data from all women 
who had surgery and provided outcome data were 
analysed by modifi
 ed intention-to-treat, remaining in 
the group to which they were randomised. Although 
crossover was not part of the study design, some 
women received a diff
 erent surgical intervention from 
the one to which they were allocated. We made 
two comparisons: standard repair versus synthetic 
mesh (mesh trial, data from women in strata A and B) 
and standard repair versus biological graft (graft trial, 
data from women in strata A and C; appendix). Some 
women from stratum A who were assigned to standard 
repair were included in both trial analyses. The main 
analysis was a complete-case analysis, with no 
imputation for missing data.
All outcome measures were presented as summaries 
of descriptive statistics (mean [SD] for continuous 
measures, and proportions for ordinal and dichotomous 
measures) and comparisons between randomised groups 
were analysed separately at 6, 12, and 24 months using 
generalised linear models. We adjusted models for 
minimisation covariates, baseline measures where 
appropriate, and randomisation stratum. We analysed 
continuous outcomes using linear mixed models with 
the surgeon fi
 tted as a random eff
 ect. Assumptions of 
linearity and normality of error distributions were 
examined by inspection of residual plots. POP-Q stage 
was 
analysed 
using 
ordinal 
logistic 
regression 
(proportional odds models with cumulative logits with 
score tests performed to examine the proportional odds 
assumption). We analysed dichotomous outcomes using 
log-binomial regression.23 Estimates of treatment eff
 ect 
size were mean diff
 erences in the mixed models, odds 
ratios in the ordinal models, and risk ratios in the binary 
models. Although the study adjusted for the two primary 
comparisons when calculating the sample size (α=0·025), 
we present 95% CIs that have not adjusted for the 
multiple comparisons. We did the study analyses 
according to a prespecifi
 ed statistical analysis plan, using 
SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).
PROSPECT was overseen by an independent trial 
steering committee and an independent data monitoring 
committee. This trial is registered as an International 
Standard

Results
Between Jan 8, 2010, and Aug 30, 2013, we randomly 
assigned 1352 (55%) of 2478 eligible women (fi
 gure), of 
whom four were excluded post-randomisation and were 
not included in the analyses. Thus, 1348 women were 
included in the analysis, but 23 women who did not 
receive any surgical intervention (15 women in the mesh 
trial and 13 women in the graft trial; fi
 ve of  whom were 
included in both trials) were included in the baseline 
analyses only. The remaining 1126 women either declined 
randomisation 
or 
were 
deemed 
ineligible 
for 
randomisation due to clinical reasons. 865 women were 
assigned to the mesh trial (430 assigned to standard 
repair alone, 435 to mesh augmentation) and 735 were 
assigned to the graft trial (367 assigned to standard repair 
alone, 368 to graft augmentation). Because the analyses 
were carried out separately for each trial (mesh and graft 
trial), some women in the standard repair group 
randomly assigned to three treatment options were 
included in the standard repair group of both trials. 
Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of 
the women having a primary repair were similar between 
groups (table 1); some women received a diff
 erent 
surgical intervention from the one to which they were 
allocated. The proportion of women who had surgery 
and received their allocated treatment was 95% for the 
standard arms in both trials (mesh trial 403/425, graft 
trial 342/359), versus 80% for mesh (341/425) and 81% 
for graft (294/363). The reasons for non-compliance with 
randomised allocation are in the appendix. Consultants 
or doctors who had completed their specialty training did 
78% and 81% of procedures in the mesh trial arms, and 
69% and 75% in the graft trial arms, respectively. The 
remainder were undertaken by experienced registrars or 
junior doctors. Primary outcome data at 1 year were

available for 91% (784/865) of the women in the mesh 
trial and 92% (679/735) of the women in the graft trial 
(table 2). Details of surgery and concomitant procedures 
received are in the appendix.
Mean POP-SS at 1 year did not diff
 er for each 
comparison (standard 5·4 [SD 5·5] vs mesh 5·5 [5·1], 
mean diff
 erence 0·00, 95% CI –0·70 to 0·71; p=0·99; 
standard 5·5 [SD 5·6] vs graft 5·6 [5·6]; mean diff
 erence 
–0·15, –0·93 to 0·63; p=0·71; table 2). Mean prolapse-
related quality-of-life scores also did not diff
 er between 
groups at 1 year (standard 2·0 [SD 2·7] vs mesh 2·2 [2·7], 
mean diff
 erence 0·13, 95% CI –0·25 to 0·51; p=0·50; 
standard 2·2 [SD 2·8] vs graft 2·4 [2·9]; mean diff
 erence 
0·13, –0·30 to 0·56; p=0·54; table 2).
The EQ-5D-3L scores also did not diff
 er between 
groups (table 2). There were no signifi
 cant subgroup 
interaction eff
 ects by treatment from any of the planned 
subgroup analyses, including surgeon eff
 ect. A per-
protocol analysis excluding those who did not receive 
their randomised intervention also did not aff
 ect the 
overall result: standard mean 5·5 (SD 5·6) versus 
mesh 5·3 (5·2), mean diff
 erence –0·19, 95% CI 
–0·95 to 0·57; standard mean 5·5 (SD 5·6) versus graft 
5·5 (5·6); mean diff
 erence –0·31, –1·14 to 0·52.
In both trials, a few diff
 erences occurred in other 
prolapse outcomes between the randomised groups at 
6 months, 1 year, or 2 years; the number of women with 
at least one symptom (symptomatic prolapse [POP-
SS>0]) was signifi
 cantly greater in the mesh group 
compared with the standard group at 6 months, ICI 
Vaginal Symptoms Scores were signifi
 cantly higher in 
the graft group compared with the standard group at 
1 year, and the number of women with a feeling of 
something coming down was signifi
 cantly greater in 
the graft group compared with the standard group at 
2 years (table 2).
No diff
 erences were noted in urinary outcomes 
between the groups in either trial at 1 or 2 years (table 2). 
Additionally, the groups did not diff
 er in terms of faecal 
incontinence or severe dyspareunia, and there were no 
diff
 erences in quality of life related to urinary, bowel, 
vaginal, or sexual symptoms, or satisfaction rates after 
surgery (appendix).
Objective outcome assessment was carried out by 
observers masked to randomisation in 581 (88%) of 
657 women in the mesh trial, and 539 (94%) of 573 in the 
graft trial. Consultants carried out 59% of the 
examinations; the rest were undertaken by recruitment 
offi
  cers (24%), junior registrars (15%) and unknown 
(2%). Although a higher proportion of women had 
objective failure (leading edge >0 cm beyond hymen) in 
the synthetic mesh and biological graft arms compared 
with standard repair, this did not reach statistical 
signifi
 cance in either case for POP-Q stage 2b, 3, or 4 
(table 3).
Within the fi
 rst 2 years, 6% of women underwent new 
prolapse surgery in the same or in another compartment 
for symptomatic and objective failure, with no diff
 erences 
between either of the randomised groups. There were no 
diff
 erences between the groups in either trial for women 
requiring new surgery for urinary incontinence in the 
fi
 rst or second years of follow-up (table 4).
Overall, the number of women with serious adverse 
eff
 ects (complications) during and after prolapse surgery 
was less than 10% in the fi
 rst year, with no signifi
 cant 
diff
 erences between the groups in either trial, except for 
mesh exposure and subsequent treatment for mesh 
complications (table 4). This was refl
 ected in the low

outpatient treatment that consisted of observation only, 
topical treatment with oestrogen, mesh trimming, or 
cautery. Most mesh exposures were small or asymptomatic 
requiring partial removal as a day case (table 4).
Although it might seem counterintuitive that women 
in the standard (no-mesh) arms could have a mesh 
complication, this could occur if the surgeon chose to 
use mesh for the repair or for a concomitant procedure 
(fi
 gure). Restricting the data to women who actually 
received synthetic mesh either as part of their anterior or 
prolapse repair or as a concomitant vault, uterine, or 
continence procedure, the number of women with a 
mesh complication in the fi
 rst two years was 51 (12%) of 
434, of whom 37 required a surgical removal (9%). 
Restricting the data further to include women who only 
received synthetic mesh as part of their anterior or 
posterior prolapse repair, with no other concomitant 
mesh procedure or mesh inserted historically, the mesh 
complication rate in the fi
 rst two years was 14% (41/284). 
In the graft trial, four women had a mesh complication 
in the fi
 rst year, but all had concomitant synthetic mesh 
and only three required surgical intervention (none were 
symptomatic or had exposures >1 cm²). Two women had 
a mesh complication in the second year, but neither 
required surgical treatment.
Discussion
There was no evidence of a signifi
 cant diff
 erence at 1 year 
in the primary outcome after transvaginal prolapse 
surgery with or without synthetic non-absorbable mesh 
or biological graft material to reinforce the repair. The CI 
around the primary outcome measure of women’s 
symptoms, the POP-SS, was smaller than the prespecifi
 ed 
minimally clinically important diff
 erence of 2, suggesting 
that a clinically signifi
 cant diff
 erence between the groups 
in either of the trials was unlikely.15 This result was 
unchanged when those who did not receive the 
randomised intervention were excluded from the 
analysis. There were also no important clinical 
diff
 erences between groups in the secondary clinical or 
objective outcomes at 1 and 2 years. Apart from mesh 
complications, the proportion of women requiring 
further treatment in both the trials was similar.
The overall incidence of serious adverse eff
 ects, other 
than mesh-related, was similar in the groups in each 
trial. By defi
 nition women could only have a mesh-related 
complication if they received mesh (whether de novo for 
the anterior or posterior repair, or as a concomitant 
procedure for continence, or for vault or uterine 
prolapse); in around a third of women this was treated 
conservatively. Additionally, only one woman had total 
mesh removal because of infection during follow-up. In 
most women, the exposure or extrusion of mesh into the 
vagina was small or asymptomatic, requiring only partial 
removal as a day case. The overall mesh complication 
rate in women who actually received synthetic mesh—
either in the mesh trial or concomitantly—was 12%. 
There was also no diff
 erence in dyspareunia rates with or 
without mesh or biological graft.
PROSPECT was the largest randomised study of the 
use of mesh or graft in transvaginal prolapse surgery to 
date. It was powered to detect a clinically meaningful 
diff
 erence in prolapse symptoms if these existed. 
Although we fell short of our stated recruitment target 
of 1450, this assumed a 17·5% dropout rate which would 
have given 1196 women with analysable data. We 
achieved a much better retention rate for the primary 
outcome (<10%), giving 1226 with analysable data, 
exceeding the 1196 target.
Our pragmatic design is a refl
 ection of actual practice of 
experienced UK prolapse surgeons across many hospital 
settings, using validated terminology and outcome 
measures in women who had a mix of prolapse types. We 
distinguished between women having a primary or 
secondary repair in the compartment requiring surgery 
(ie, women who were classed as having a primary 
prolapse in a new compartment could have had surgery 
in a diff
 erent compartment previously). This also enabled 
us subsequently to diff
 erentiate between repeat surgery 
in the operated compartment and further surgery in the 
opposite one: both occurred equally often. Additionally, 
the proportions of women having concomitant upper 
compartment prolapse or continence surgery were evenly 
distributed between the randomised groups, and 
therefore did not aff
 ect the fi
 ndings of the two trials.
The POP-Q system defi
 nes stage 2 as a measurement 
from –1 cm inside the hymen to 1 cm beyond.19 We and 
other researchers subdivided stage 2 and used a cutoff
  of 
more than 0 cm to indicate objective failure.20 Use of the 
full stage 2 range would imply that at least 50% of women 
were not objectively cured after their prolapse surgery. 
However, our results show that the outcomes would have 
been the same whichever stage of prolapse was chosen as 
the cutoff
 .
We used strata to allow surgeons who could not off
 er 
all three interventions to participate, thus boosting the 
potential population and shortening the recruitment 
period to the trial. One limitation was that to calculate 
unbiased estimates of treatment eff
 ects, we could only 
use two of three strata in any analysis (A plus B for 
comparisons with synthetic mesh, A plus C for 
comparisons with biological graft). However, the power 
of the analysis was only reduced by a modest amount, 
because the three-arm stratum A was the largest stratum 
and was used in every analysis.
Few women (15) seemed to be classed as stage 0 or 1 on 
POP-Q before surgery. In some cases, there was evidence 
that the full descent had not been measured, or prolapse 
might have been documented at a previous visit. All 
these women had symptoms, and met the inclusion 
criteria that their surgeon deemed suffi
  cient indication 
for prolapse surgery. However, the variation in baseline 
measurements suggests inconsistency between surgeons 
in their indications for surgery.

The surgical team could not be masked to delivery of 
the randomised operation, and knowledge of the surgical 
option might have infl
 uenced the ascertainment of the 
outcomes reported. However, in 1126 cases, the women 
or their surgeons did have fi
 rm preconceptions about the 
use of mesh and declined randomisation. More than 85% 
of the clinicians responsible for ascertaining objective 
outcomes were masked to randomised allocation before 
their clinical examination at follow-up.
Although we did not formally record the number of 
women who either knew which treatment they received 
(eg, because they needed further treatment or asked for 
the information) or thought they knew, we believe the 
proportion was low, based on discussions with the trial 
investigators and the participants themselves, often at 
the time of the clinical assessment at 1 year. Even for 
these women, the interval between surgery and outcome 
measurement—when there would have been plenty of 
scope for further interventions according to clinical 
need—makes it unlikely that any preconceptions or 
prejudices about their surgery created any substantial 
bias in treatment estimates.
PROSPECT was a pragmatic eff
 ectiveness trial, to 
assess the benefi
 ts and possible harms of prolapse 
surgery enhanced by mesh or graft against standard 
repair, in an unselected group of women operated on by 
appropriately experienced surgeons using their usual 
techniques and mesh or graft materials. PROSPECT was 
not an effi
  cacy trial, in selected women being operated 
on exclusively by the most experienced surgeons in the 
highest volume centres using a specifi
 c brand of mesh or 
graft with a highly protocolised technique. Our pragmatic 
eff
 ectiveness design allowed PROSPECT to generate, 
using a well done study, high quality evidence for the 
real-world comparison of these surgical options. The 
fi
 ndings are therefore directly relevant to all women 
facing this operation in the UK National Health Service.
A specifi
 c brand of mesh or graft could, in the hands of 
specialist surgeons (who are perhaps the most expert or 
gifted at that technique) and on selected women, produce 
better outcomes. However, one would still face the 
challenge of extending that benefi
 t to more women by 
better surgical training and more frequent use of the 
specifi
 c techniques, assuming that the particular mesh 
or graft was aff
 ordable and acceptable to the women, and 
safe in all comers.
The PROSPECT study has shown that, in the fi
 rst 2 years 
after surgery, there is no benefi
 t to women having their 
fi
 rst prolapse repair from the use of transvaginal synthetic 
mesh or biological graft to reinforce a standard anterior or 
posterior repair, either in terms of prolapse symptoms or 
in short term anatomical cure. This contrasts with the 
conclusions of the most recent Cochrane review, updated 
in 2016 and including 37 trials,9 which reported a reduction 
in the number of women with awareness of prolapse with 
synthetic mesh and fewer with anatomical recurrence;9 
our fi
 ndings concur with the uncertainty of the evidence 
for a diff
 erence for biological grafts but with narrower CIs.9 
However, the quality of this evidence remained very low to 
moderate, due to poor reporting of study methods, 
inconsistency, and imprecision in the included trials.
When the PROSPECT data from this report were 
added to the Cochrane review results on July 6, 2016,9 the 
summary statistics still favoured mesh both in terms of 
awareness of prolapse (RR 0·83, 95% CI 0·71 to 0·96) 
and anatomical recurrence (RR 0·42, 0·32 to 0·56). 
However, there was heterogeneity in the trials included 
in the Cochrane review, with some done in women with 
uterine or vault prolapse rather than the lower 
compartments. Few trials diff
 erentiated between women 
having primary and secondary repairs, and some used 
mesh kits rather than inlays. The trials also varied in 
their inclusion criteria regarding concomitant procedures 
and continence surgery. By contrast, PROSPECT 
randomly assigned a strictly defi
 ned group of women 
having their fi
 rst repair in an anterior or posterior 
compartment and used non-absorbable mesh inlays only. 
A single large trial that is free from risk of bias might be 
more powerful and reliable for the specifi
 c population 
included than a meta-analysis of many smaller trials.
The women included in the two PROSPECT trials were 
representative of the whole population of women 
presenting with prolapse symptoms, including those 
with 
multicompartment 
prolapse 
or 
urinary 
incontinence. Our fi
 ndings provide robust evidence on 
which to base counselling for surgical decision making. 
However, these fi
 ndings are confi
 ned to the fi
 rst 2 years 
after surgery and to women having their fi
 rst repair only. 
Longer-term follow-up is required to truly assess any 
potential benefi
 ts of transvaginal mesh or graft on which 
reliable recommendations for women requiring anterior 
or posterior prolapse surgery can be based.
Our study showed that more than 30% of women who 
have prolapse surgery have a residual feeling of 
something coming down and more than 80% have at 
least one residual prolapse symptom, highlighting the 
poor short term outcomes of transvaginal anterior or 
posterior prolapse surgery with or without reinforcement. 
New research should be aimed at fi
 nding and testing 
methods that will improve those outcomes.
Given that recurrent prolapse requiring repeat repair 
occurs on average 12 years after a fi
 rst standard repair, 
ongoing follow-up is essential to determine whether 
mesh or graft repairs might yet prove more durable in 
the long term, and to identify further adverse sequelae of 
mesh or graft insertion.
The PROSPECT study showed that augmenting a 
primary transvaginal anterior or posterior prolapse repair 
with non-absorbable synthetic mesh or biological graft 
confers no symptomatic or anatomical benefi
 t to women 
in the short term. More than one in ten women had a 
mesh complication, but most were asymptomatic, and 
most of the mesh exposures measured less than 1 cm². 
Although no evidence was apparent of diff
 erences

between standard, mesh, or graft repair in other adverse 
eff
 ects up to 2 years after surgery, mesh use did result in 
the need for additional surgical procedures for exposures 
and extrusion in the fi
 rst 2 years, which might be 
considered to be an unnecessary risk. This additional 
risk suggests that in the future mesh should only be used 
in the context of trials aimed at identifying benefi
 t from 
modifying mesh type or insertion techniques, or in 
defi
 ned categories of high-risk women. Long-term 
follow-up to assess both eff
 ectiveness and adverse eff
 ects, 
which is ongoing,12 is vital.
