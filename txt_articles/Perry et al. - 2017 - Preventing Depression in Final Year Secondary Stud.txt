FOREWORD 
This report provides compelling reading for everyone interested in the health and wellbeing of 
Australian children and adolescents. Based on a survey conducted in the homes of over 6,300 families 
with children and/or adolescents aged 4 to 17 years, the report presents a comprehensive picture of the 
mental health of young Australians. It documents the prevalence and type of mental health problems, 
the impact of those problems on families and young people themselves and the role of health and 
education services in providing assistance. While the primary sources of information were parents and 
carers, the survey also engaged directly with young people 11 years and older who completed their own 
survey. This information provides unique insights about aspects of their emotional lives and behaviour 
that are generally not visible to parents and carers. 
Australia has a proud tradition of undertaking mental health surveys of its population. Commencing in 
1997 with the first household survey of the adult population, the National Survey of Mental Health and 
Wellbeing programme has produced six major surveys. Two of these covered the more common mental 
disorders in adults conducted in 1997 and 2007, two covered people living with less prevalent psychotic 
illnesses conducted in 1998 and 2010, and now with this report, two surveys have been undertaken of 
the mental health of children and adolescents. The first child and adolescent survey was conducted in 
1998 and released in 2000. It was the first national survey of its type conducted anywhere in the world. 
The report on the second child and adolescent mental health survey presents a contemporary update 
on the next generation of Australian adults that is both reassuring and troubling. Overall prevalence of 
mental disorders appears to be stable, with approximately one in seven children and young people 
experiencing a mental disorder in the past year. This is consistent with comparable international 
studies. The most positive news is that access by families and young people to assistance appears to 
have increased substantially. The first survey found that only one third of children and adolescents 
aged 6-17 years with mental disorders used services in 1998 in the previous six months. By contrast the 
second survey found just over two thirds were able to access services, although this was measured over 
a 12-month period. The vast majority (95%) used a health service. Despite differences in methodology 
between the two surveys, the report notes that on balance the data points to a significant increase in 
service use by children and adolescents with mental disorders in Australia between 1998 and 2014. 
It is pleasing that the evidence from this more recent survey shows that those most in need have the 
best access to services. About nine out of every ten young people with a severe mental disorder 
accessed assistance from the service systems provided by the health and education sectors, as did 
about three quarters of those with problems of a moderate impact. This provides reassurance that the 
policies adopted by governments to lift the known low treatment rates for people with mental illness 
are achieving results. The Australian Government in particular has had a special focus on improving 
both prevention and treatment efforts for young Australians, commencing with the introduction of the 
National Youth Mental Health Initiative in 2005 (now known as headspace). 
More troubling is the range of information presented in this report that points to the need for refocussed 
effort by governments and the broader community to develop systems to both prevent mental health 
problems and to respond early to problems when they emerge. The rates for depression, self-harm and 
thoughts about suicide in teenagers are particularly worrying, with approximately one in ten indicating 
that they have engaged in self-harming behaviour. Three quarters did so in the previous 12 months. For 
 iv 
The Mental Health of Children and Adolescents 
teenage girls aged 16-17 years, nearly one in five were found to meet the clinical criteria for depression 
based on their own report. Around one quarter of teenage girls in the 16-17 year age range reported 
deliberately injuring themselves at some point in their lives. The rates for depression in 11-17 year olds 
were found to be higher when young people provided the information themselves (7.7%) than when 
their parents and carers did so (4.7%). This is an important signal to all parents who are faced with the 
challenging task of helping their children navigate the transition from childhood to adulthood. 
Additionally, this survey has again highlighted the strong relationship between socioeconomic 
disadvantage and higher rates of mental health problems that has been found in comparable 
international studies. Children and adolescents in low-income families, with parents and carers with 
lower levels of education and with higher levels of unemployment had higher rates of mental disorders 
in the previous 12 months. There was also a strong relationship with where they lived as significantly 
higher rates of mental disorders were found in non-metropolitan areas. 
Overall, the survey highlights the need for continued effort by governments and the broader community 
to improve the mental health of children and young people and to continue our collaborative work to 
achieve more effective prevention. A continued focus on suicide prevention and early intervention must 
be central platforms of the service systems that we build in the health, education and welfare sectors. 
As this report demonstrates, the health system has a key role to play but the roles of the education and 
welfare sectors are also critical in responding to the needs of children and young people with mental 
health problems. 
The Australian Government is committed to maintaining a strong focus on prevention and early 
intervention efforts to reduce the prevalence and impact of mental health problems in our young 
population. The survey shows that the investment by government in youth mental health is making an 
impact on service access, however, it also highlights the importance of targeting available resources to 
focus on emerging need. 
This is why the Government tasked the National Mental Health Commission to conduct a 
comprehensive review of mental health services in Australia. Following the release of this review and its 
recommendations State, Territory and Commonwealth Governments agreed to recommit to a 
bipartisan approach to comprehensive mental health reform. 
Results from the Second Australian Child and Adolescent Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing have 
produced a wealth of information that will guide the development of mental health policy and 
programmes for young people well into the future. Surveys of this type are highly specialist in nature, 
expensive and demanding on all involved. I wish to express our gratitude to all who contributed, 
particularly to the families who willingly gave their time to provide information about areas of their 
family life that are sensitive and deeply personal. I also wish to thank the team at the Telethon Kids 
Institute at the University of Western Australia who so ably planned and coordinated the survey, 
producing this publication.

SECOND AUSTRALIAN CHILD AND ADOLESCENT SURVEY OF MENTAL 
HEALTH AND WELLBEING HIGHLIGHTS 
A second national survey of the mental health and wellbeing of Australian children and 
adolescents was conducted by the Telethon Kids Institute at The University of Western 
Australia in partnership with Roy Morgan Research in 2013-14.  
 The second national child and adolescent 
survey was a household survey of parents 
and carers of 4-17 year-olds in the general 
population and 11-17 year-olds 
themselves. 
Aims of the survey 
Aims of the survey 
 The main aims were to determine: 
1.  How many children and adolescents 
had which mental health problems and 
disorders. 
2.  The nature and impact of these. 
3.  How many children and adolescents 
had used services for mental health 
problems. 
4.  The role of the education sector in 
providing these services. 
Diagnostic assessment of mental disorders 
Diagnostic assessment of mental disorders 
 The Diagnostic Interview Schedule for 
Children Version IV (DISC-IV) was used to 
assess young people against the Diagnostic 
and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 
Version IV (DSM-IV) criteria. 
 Disorders that were most common and had 
the greatest impact on children and 
adolescents were assessed. These were:  
1. Anxiety disorders  
‐ Social phobia  
‐ Separation anxiety disorder 
‐ Generalised anxiety disorder 
‐ Obsessive-compulsive disorder 
2. Major depressive disorder 
3.  Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder 
(ADHD) 
4. Conduct disorder. 
What participants were asked 
What participants were asked 
 Parents and carers took on average 60 minutes 
to complete a questionnaire with a trained 
interviewer. This included the following: 
‐ Family structure and socio-demographics; 
‐ General health of child and disabilities; 
‐ DISC-IV modules and functional impairment; 
‐ Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire; 
‐ Service use in past 12 months and perceived 
need for help; 
‐ School attendance and performance; and 
‐ Family characteristics, life stressor events, 
and parent/carer mental health measures. 
 Young people aged 11-17 years completed a 
questionnaire in private on a tablet computer, 
taking on average 35 minutes to do so. This 
included the following: 
‐ DISC-IV Major depressive disorder module; 
‐ Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire; 
‐ Kessler Psychological Distress Scale; 
‐ Service use in past 12 months and perceived 
need for help; 
‐ Use of internet and informal supports; 
‐ Self-harm and suicidal behaviours; 
‐ Experience of bullying; and 
‐ Health-risk behaviours, including substance 
use and problem eating behaviours. 
Who participated 
Who participated 
 In total 76,606 households were approached 
and visited up to 6 times each between June 
2013 and April 2014. 
 This resulted in 6,310 or 55% of eligible 
households and 2,967 or 89% of eligible young 
people responding.

PREVALENCE OF MENTAL DISORDERS IN AUSTRALIAN CHILDREN AND 
ADOLESCENTS 
The Australian Child and Adolescent Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing provides 
information on the prevalence of mental disorders in children and adolescents in Australia. 
The prevalence of mental disorders is the proportion of children and adolescents in the 
population who meet DSM-IV criteria for a diagnosis of a mental disorder within the 12 
months prior to the survey. 
 Almost one in seven (13.9%) 4-17 year-olds 
were assessed as having mental disorders 
in the previous 12 months. This is 
equivalent to 560,000 Australian children 
and adolescents. 
 Males were more likely than females to 
have experienced mental disorders in the 
12 months prior to the survey (16.3% 
compared with 11.5%). 
 ADHD was the most common mental 
disorder in children and adolescents 
(7.4%), followed by anxiety disorders 
(6.9%), major depressive disorder (2.8%) 
and conduct disorder (2.1%). 
 Based on these prevalence rates it is 
estimated that in the previous 12 months 
298,000 Australian children and 
adolescents aged 4-17 years would have 
had ADHD, 278,000 had anxiety disorders, 
112,000 had major depressive disorder and 
83,600 had conduct disorder. 
 Almost one third (30.0% or 4.2% of all 4-17 
year-olds) of children and adolescents with 
a disorder had two or more mental 
disorders at some time in the previous 12 
months. 
 Prevalence did not differ significantly with 
age for males (16.5% for 4-11 year-olds and 
15.9% for 12-17 year-olds), but was slightly 
higher in older females than younger 
females (10.6% for 4-11 year-olds and 
12.8% for 12-17 year-olds).

IMPACT OF MENTAL DISORDERS 
Mental disorders impact on individuals in a wide variety of ways and to varying extents. 
Assessment of the impact on functioning at school, with family and with friends, and the 
personal distress symptoms caused was used as the basis for determining the severity of 
disorders. 
 Three fifths (59.8%) of 4-17 year-olds with a 
mental disorder or 8.3% of all children and 
adolescents had a mild disorder. 
 One quarter (25.4%) of 4-17 year-olds with 
mental disorders or 3.5% of all children and 
adolescents had a moderate disorder. 
 Just over one in seven (14.7%) 4-17 year-olds 
with a mental disorder were assessed as 
having a severe mental disorder. This is 
equivalent to one in 50 (2.1%) or 
approximately 82,000 Australian children and 
adolescents. 
 Adolescents were almost three times more 
likely to experience a severe mental 
disorder – 23.1% of 12-17 year-olds with a 
mental disorder had a severe disorder 
compared with 8.2% of 4-11 year-olds with a 
mental disorder. 
 Major depressive disorder had a greater 
impact on functioning than the other 
disorders, with two fifths or 42.8% of cases 
being severe and another 35.8% assessed as 
moderate. 
 The majority of anxiety disorders, ADHD and 
conduct disorder cases were mild. Two thirds 
(65.7%) of 4-17 year-olds with ADHD, 53.8% 
with anxiety disorders and 58.7% with 
conduct disorder were assessed as having a 
mild disorder. 
 3.3% of 12-17 year-olds had a severe mental 
disorder compared with 1.1% of 4-11 year-
olds.

SERVICE USE FOR EMOTIONAL AND BEHAVIOURAL PROBLEMS 
A wide range of services are available to assist young people with emotional and 
behavioural problems. Parents and carers reported on the health, school, telephone 
counselling and online services used by young people, as well as any medication taken.
 One in six (17.0%) children and adolescents 
aged 4-17 years had used services for 
emotional or behavioural problems in the 
previous 12 months. 
‐ One in seven (14.8%) used health services. 
‐ One in nine (11.5%) used school services. 
‐ Just over half (53.5%) of 4-17 year-olds 
using services used both health and 
school services. 
Services for young people with disorders 
Services for young people with disorders 
 Just over half (56.0%) of 4-17 year-olds with 
mental disorders had used services for 
emotional and behavioural problems in the 
previous 12 months. 
 Service use was higher among children and 
adolescents with more severe disorders.  
‐ Two fifths (41.2%) of those with mild 
disorders, 72.5% of those with moderate 
disorders and 87.6% of those with severe 
disorders had used services.

 One in eight (12.8%) children and 
adolescents with mental disorders had taken 
a medication for emotional or behavioural 
problems in the previous two weeks. 
 The majority (94.6%) of young people with 
mental disorders using services in the 
previous 12 months had used health services. 
‐ Just over one third (35.0%) of 4-17 
year-olds had seen a general practitioner. 
‐ Almost a quarter (23.9%) had seen a 
psychologist. 
‐ One fifth (21.0%) had seen a paediatrician. 
‐ One fifth (20.7%) had seen a counsellor or 
a family therapist. 
 One in sixteen (6.2%) 4-17 year-olds with 
mental disorders were admitted to hospital, 
or attended an emergency or outpatient 
department in the previous 12 months. 
 Specialist child and adolescent mental 
health services were used by 3.3% of 4-17 
year-olds with mental disorders in the 
previous 12 months. 
 Parents and carers reported that 7.3% of 12-
17 year-olds with mental disorders visited a 
headspace centre in the previous 12 months. 
 Schools provided services to 40.2% of the 
children and adolescents with mental 
disorders who attended them:

PERCEIVED NEED FOR SERVICES 
Parents and carers were asked about whether their children received the services they 
needed for emotional and behavioural problems, and whether they had unmet needs or they 
had no need for services. They were also asked about the barriers to seeking help or 
receiving more help where their needs were not fully met. 
 Just over one quarter (26.8%) of parents and 
carers reported that their child or adolescent 
needed help for emotional or behavioural 
problems in the previous 12 months. 
 Of those who had a need for help, four out of 
ten (42.9%) had their needs fully met and 
27.3% partially met.

 Nearly four fifths (78.6%) of 4-17 year-olds 
with mental disorders were reported as 
needing help in the previous 12 months. 
Three quarters (73.8%) of these had their 
needs for help fully or partially met. 
 Counselling was identified as being needed 
more often, with two thirds (68.1%) of 4-17 
year-olds needing counselling and two thirds 
of these (67.7%) having their needs fully or 
partially met. 
 One third (36.0%) of 4-17 year-olds needed 
life skills training, but for the majority (60.9%) 
this need was not met. 
 Met need increased with severity, with 
parents and carers reporting that 84.2% of 
those with severe disorders and 81.8% of 
those with moderate had their needs for help 
fully or partially met. 
 Parents and carers received a variety of help 
themselves to assist them with dealing with 
their children’s problems. This included 
information, counselling, parenting courses, 
respite care and support groups — 61.0% 
reported they needed this kind of help and 
for 78.1% their needs were fully or partially 
met.

SCHOOL SERVICES AND SUPPORTS, AND THE IMPACT OF PROBLEMS 
ON YOUNG PEOPLE’S SCHOOLING 
Schools play a major role in supporting young people with emotional and behavioural 
problems and are often where symptoms of mental disorders are first identified. 
Data are for the 95.9% of 4-17 year-olds attending school or another educational institution.
 A school staff member was among those to 
suggest that some help for emotional or 
behavioural problems was needed in two 
fifths (40.5%) of cases. 
 One in nine (11.5%) students had used a 
school service for emotional or behavioural 
problems in the previous 12 months. 
‐ 8.0% received individual counselling. 
‐ 2.7% received group counselling or 
participated in a support program. 
 Just over one fifth (22.6%) of young people 
who used health services had been referred 
by their school. 
 Teachers and other school staff provided 
18.9% of students with informal support for 
emotional and behavioural problems. This 
was higher (51.0%) for students assessed as 
having a mental disorder. 
 Of the four types of disorder, major 
depressive disorder had the greatest impact 
on school attendance. Students with this 
disorder averaged 20 days absent from 
school in the previous 12 months due to its 
symptoms. 
 Major depressive disorder had the greatest 
impact on functioning at school, with one 
third (34.3%) of students experiencing severe 
impact and another 34.1% a moderate 
impact due to this disorder. 
 For adolescents, conduct disorders had 
almost the same level of impact (22.8% 
severe and 43.6% moderate), but conversely 
also had the highest proportion (21.8%) for 
whom the disorder had no impact.

WHAT ADOLESCENTS TOLD US 
ABOUT THEIR MENTAL HEALTH 
Young people aged 11 years and older were asked, with their parents and carers consent, to 
complete a questionnaire in private on a tablet computer — 89% did so. This included 
various measures of their mental health, as well as the same DISC-IV major depressive 
disorder diagnostic module completed by their parents and carers to assess if they had a 
major depressive disorder based on DSM-IV criteria. 
Major depressive disorder

self-report 
self-report 
 One in thirteen (7.7%) adolescents aged 
11-17 years met the DSM-IV diagnostic 
criteria for major depressive disorder in the 
previous 12 months. 
 Major depressive disorder was more 
common in females and older adolescents, 
affecting 7.2% of males and 19.6% of females 
aged 16-17 years.

 The prevalence of major depressive disorder 
was far higher when young people provided 
the information themselves than when their 
parents and carers did so (7.7% compared 
with 4.7% of 11-17 year-olds). 
 There was low agreement on the prevalence 
of major depressive disorder when 
comparing adolescent and parent or carer 
reported information (1.9%). 
Psychological distress 
Psychological distress 
 One fifth (19.9%) of adolescents had very 
high or high levels of psychological distress. 
‐ This was almost twice as high for females 
(25.9% and 14.8% for males). 
‐ This was four times higher (80.7%) for 
those with major depressive disorder 
based on self-report.

WHAT ADOLESCENTS TOLD US 
ABOUT SERVICES THEY USED, OTHER SOURCES OF SUPPORT AND  
WHAT ELSE THEY DID TO HELP THEMSELVES 
Young people aged 13 years and older were asked to provide information on the health, 
school and telephone counselling services that they used, as well as if they had used the 
internet to help them with emotional and behavioural problems. They also provided their 
perspective on whether their needs for help were met, as well as barriers to seeking help.
Services and support 
Services and support 
 In addition to receiving health and school 
services, young people used a variety of other 
sources of support for their emotional and 
behavioural problems. 
 Of all young people aged 13-17 years 3.6% 
reported using telephone counselling. 
 Just over a fifth (22.2%) of 13-17 year-olds 
had used internet services. 
‐ 10.0% used online assessment tools. 
‐ 4.4% used online self-help. 
‐ 3.1% participated in a chat room or online 
support group. 
‐ 1.7% received online personal support or 
counselling. 
 
Three fifths (62.9%) of adolescents reported 
receiving informal help or support for 
emotional and behavioural problems, most 
often from parents and friends. The 
proportion was much higher at 93.9% for 
adolescents with major depressive disorder 
based on self-report. 
Behaviours to assist with mental health 
Behaviours to assist with mental health 
 Two thirds (66.4%) of adolescents reported 
other strategies to help them manage any 
emotional or behavioural problems that they 
may have had or to avoid having problems. 
 More often they did positive things, such as 
doing more exercise or taking up a sport 
(37.9%), doing more activities they enjoyed 
(45.1%), seeking support from friends (24.4%) 
and improving their diet (23.2%). 
 Just under one in 12 (7.9%) reported 
smoking cigarettes, or using alcohol or drugs 
to help. The proportion was much higher at 
31.5% for adolescents with major depressive 
disorder based on self-report. 
Perceived need for help 
Perceived need for help 
 Four fifths (82.4%) of 13-17 year-olds 
reported needing some type of help for 
emotional and behavioural problems in the 
previous 12 months. Of these, three quarters 
(76.8%) had their needs fully or partially met. 
 The proportions needing help and whose 
needs were met were far higher for those 
with more severe disorders, with 90.6% of 
13-17 year-olds with major depressive 
disorder based on self-report indicating they 
had needed help and 88.0% that these needs 
were met in the previous 12 months. 
Barriers to seeking help or receiving more help 
Barriers to seeking help or receiving more help 
 The most common reasons for not seeking 
help or receiving more help given by 13-17 
year-old adolescents with major depressive 
disorder based on self-report were related to 
stigma or poor mental health literacy. 
‐ 62.9% worried what other people might 
think or not want to talk to a stranger. 
‐ 61.7% thought the problem would get 
better by itself. 
‐ 57.1% wanted to work out the problem on 
their own or with help from family or 
friends.

WHAT ADOLESCENTS TOLD US 
ABOUT SELF-HARM 
The term self-harm refers to deliberately hurting or injuring yourself without trying to end 
your life. It is often done secretively.
 Around one in 10 12-17 year-olds (10.9%) 
reported having ever self-harmed. 
‐ This is equivalent to 186,000 young people 
aged 12-17 years who had deliberately 
injured themselves. 
‐ About three quarters (73.5%) of these 
adolescents had harmed themselves in the 
previous 12 months. 
 Self-harm was roughly twice as high in 
females compared with males and also in 
older compared with younger adolescents. 
 Females aged 16-17 years had the highest 
rates of self-harm, with 16.8% having harmed 
themselves in the previous 12 months. 
 Self-harm was markedly higher in young 
people with major depressive disorder. One 
quarter (25.8%) of males and just over half 
(54.9%) of females with major depressive 
disorder (based on self-report) had harmed 
themselves in the previous 12 months. 
 Self-harm can result in serious injuries and 
0.8% of young people had been admitted to 
hospital as a direct result of these injuries.

WHAT ADOLESCENTS TOLD US 
ABOUT SUICIDAL BEHAVIOURS 
Suicidal behaviours include suicidal ideation (serious thoughts about taking one’s own life), 
suicide plans and suicide attempts. These differ from self-harm in that the self-injury is 
intended to end in death. 
 About one in thirteen (7.5%) 12-17 year-
olds had seriously considered attempting 
suicide in the previous 12 months. This is 
equivalent to around 128,000 young people 
aged 12-17 years. 
 One in twenty (5.2%) had made a plan. 
 One in forty (2.4%) or around 41,000 12-17 
year-olds reported having attempted 
suicide in the previous 12 months. One 
quarter or 0.6% received medical 
treatment as a result of their injuries. 
 Suicidal behaviours were more common in 
females than males and in 16-17 year-olds 
compared with younger adolescents. 
  Around one in seven (15.4%) females aged 
16-17 years had seriously considered 
attempting suicide and one in twenty 
(4.7%) had attempted suicide in the 
previous 12 months. 
 The rates of all suicidal behaviours were 
markedly higher in young people with 
major depressive disorder. These were 
even higher for young females with major 
depressive disorder. 
‐ Approximately half (56.4%) of females 
aged 12-17 years with major depressive 
disorder (based on self-report) had 
seriously considered suicide and just 
over a fifth (22.1%) had attempted 
suicide in the previous 12 months. 
‐ 13.8% of males aged 12-17 years with 
major depressive disorder (based on 
self-report) had attempted suicide in the 
previous 12 months.

WHAT ADOLESCENTS TOLD US 
ABOUT BEHAVIOURS THAT COULD PUT THEM AT RISK 
Young people aged 11 years and older provided information on face-to-face and cyber 
bullying, problem eating behaviours and other behaviours that could put them at risk 
physically and/or mentally.
Bullying 
Bullying 
 One third (34.3%) of 11-17 year-olds had 
been bullied in the previous 12 months. 
11.3% felt a lot or extremely upset when 
bullied. 
 Three fifths (62.8%) of young people with 
major depressive disorder based on 
self-report had been bullied in the previous 
12 months, and they were bullied more often. 
‐ Three times as many (28.3% compared 
with 10.0% of all adolescents) were bullied 
every few weeks or more often. 
‐ Two fifths (39.4%) felt a lot or extremely 
upset when bullied. 
 One in eight (12.7%) young people bullied 
someone else every few months or less and 
2.0% did so every few weeks or more often in 
the previous 12 months. Young people with 
major depressive disorder were roughly twice 
as likely (22.5%) to bully someone else. 
Problem eating behaviours 
Problem eating behaviours 
 Low weight problem eating behaviours 
(underweight on the age-adjusted BMI and 
practising weight controlling behaviours) 
were reported by 1.1% of 11-17 year-olds 
 Binge eating and purging were reported by 
1.3% of 11-17 year-olds. 
Smoking, alcohol and other substance use 
Smoking, alcohol and other substance use 
 One in fourteen (7.2%) 13-17 year-olds had 
smoked in the last 30 days. 
 Smoking was higher for young people with 
major depressive disorder, with one quarter 
(24.4%) having smoked in the last 30 days. 
 Just over one in six (18.1%) young people 
had drunk alcohol in the last 30 days and 
12.5% had drunk more than four drinks in a 
row in the last 30 days. 
 Alcohol consumption was higher among 
young people with major depressive disorder 
based on self-report, with 27.6% having 
drunk more than four drinks in a row in the 
last 30 days. 
 One in twenty (5.0%) young people had used 
cannabis and 1.6% had used other drugs in 
the last 30 days. 
 Use was far higher for young people with 
major depressive disorder based on 
self-report, with 13.1% having used cannabis 
and 6.1% other drugs in the last 30 days. 
Internet use and electronic gaming 
Internet use and electronic gaming 
 One quarter (24.9%) of 11-17 year-olds spent 
3-4 hours a day on weekdays on the internet, 
while 17.6% spent 5-8 hours and 10.3% spent 
9 hours or more. Use was similar on the 
weekend (25.9%, 23.7% and 12.1%). 
 One eighth (12.2%) of 11-17 year-olds spent 
3-4 hours a day on weekdays playing 
electronic games, while 6.9% spent 5-8 hours 
and 2.5% spent 9 hours or more. Use almost 
doubled on the weekend (19.7%, 12.3% and 
4.7%). 
 Internet use and/or electronic gaming were 
highly problematic for 3.9% of 11-17 
year-olds, affecting their ability to eat, sleep, 
and spend time with family, friends and 
doing homework.

The Mental Health of Children and Adolescents 
 
COMPARISONS BETWEEN THE FIRST AND SECOND SURVEYS 
The first national survey of the mental health of children and adolescent was undertaken in 
1998. This produced the first evidence of the prevalence of mental disorders in Australian 
young people and their use of services for these problems. While the second survey has the 
same focus and was designed to enable comparisons to be made, there are some significant 
differences in the mental disorders assessed, and the service use timeframe and scope.
Prevalence of disorders 
Prevalence of disorders 
 The DISC-IV was used in both the first and 
second surveys to assess whether young 
people had mental disorders according to 
the standard DSM-IV diagnostic criteria. 
 In 1998 major depressive disorder, dysthymic 
disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity 
disorder, conduct disorder and eating 
disorders were assessed. 
 In 2013-14 the dysthymic and eating 
disorders modules were not included, as the 
prevalences for these were found to be too 
low for reporting in 1998. 
 Four types of anxiety disorder (social phobia, 
separation anxiety, generalised anxiety and 
obsessive-compulsive disorder) were also 
included in 2013-14. These were found to 
affect 6.9% of children and adolescents, with 
the majority only experiencing anxiety 
disorders. This has a significant impact on 
comparisons between surveys of the overall 
prevalence of mental disorders. 
 Comparison of prevalence data from 1998 
and 2013-14 did not reveal a great deal of 
change overall, however, there were 
significant changes in the prevalence of each 
of those mental disorders covered by both 
surveys. 
‐ The prevalence of major depressive 
disorder increased from 2.1% to 3.2% in 
2013-14. 
‐ The prevalence of ADHD decreased from 
9.8% to 7.8%. 
‐ Conduct disorder decreased slightly from 
2.7% to 2.1%. 
Service use 
Service use 
 The service use module was redesigned for 
the second survey, both to ensure its 
relevance to the current mental health care 
environment, particularly the development 
of online information and services, and to 
better capture the role of schools in 
providing services, referrals and support. 
 The first survey produced evidence of service 
use in the previous 6 months, and found that 
only 31.2% of 6-17 year olds with mental 
disorders used services in 1998. By contrast 
the second survey found 68.3% of this 
population used services, but this was 
measured over a 12-month period.  
 While differences in survey content and time 
periods covered make comparisons difficult, 
the increase in use of services is higher than 
is likely to be attributable to changes in 
methodology alone.  On balance, the data 
suggest that there has been a significant 
increase in service use by children and 
adolescents with mental disorders in 
Australia between 1998 and 2013-14.

INTRODUCTION 
Young Minds Matter: The second Australian Child and Adolescent Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing 
is part of the National Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing initiative. This is an Australian 
Government Department of Health funded initiative comprising national surveys of adults in the 
general population in 1997 and 2007, those with psychotic illnesses in 1997-98 and 2010, and the first 
national child and adolescent survey. 
The 1998 Australian Child and Adolescent Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing was the first national 
survey anywhere in the world to focus on the mental health of children and adolescents. The survey 
found that mental health problems were relatively common, with approximately 14% of children and 
adolescents having mental health problems based on scores obtained from the Child Behaviour 
Checklist (CBCL). It also found that only one in four children and adolescents with mental health 
problems had attended professional services in the six months prior to the survey.  
Since 1998 there have been substantial changes in the way mental health care is provided in Australia. 
There have been significant changes in people’s understanding of mental health. A range of new 
programmes and services has been developed in the education and health sectors that provide 
information, support, and specialist help for young people and their families. Programmes such as 
KidsMatter and Mind Matters promote mental health through the school environment. While each 
jurisdiction has taken its own approach, schools are generally providing higher levels of support, 
including access to specialist counselling. Through the Australian Government’s Better Access 
programme introduced in November 2006, more general practitioners have been trained in 
supporting the mental health needs of children and adolescents and their families, and children and 
families now have access to Medicare-subsidised psychological therapy. Also launched in 2006, 
headspace has rapidly expanded and provides a range of support services for young people aged 12-
25 years with emotional and behavioural problems and substance use problems. Additionally, several 
counselling services are now available by telephone, and a range of internet-based services has also 
been created that provide information and counselling support online. 
A second national adult survey of mental health and wellbeing was conducted in 2007. The survey 
found approximately one in five adults had experienced a mental health problem in the preceding 
year, and for a substantial proportion of these adults, their problems first started in childhood or 
adolescence. While access to mental health services has improved considerably, it is recognised that 
for many people there can still be substantial delays in seeking help, at the time when early 
interventions may have the greatest impact.  
The second Australian Child and Adolescent Survey not only provides data that complements other 
national surveys, but also presents a contemporary picture of mental disorders and services used by 
those young people who have mental health problems. 
1.1 
Young Minds Matter 
The Second Australian Child and Adolescent Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing (Young Minds 
Matter) was designed to provide current information about the mental health and wellbeing of 
 18 
The Mental Health of Children and Adolescents 
children and adolescents in Australia and the extent to which they use health and education services 
to obtain help with problems.  
The main aims of the survey were to determine: 
1.  How many children and adolescents have which mental health problems and disorders. 
2.  The nature of these mental health problems and disorders. 
3.  The impact of these problems and disorders. 
4.  How many children and adolescents have used services for mental health problems and 
disorders. 
5.  The role of the education sector in providing services for children and adolescents with 
mental health problems and disorders. 
In order to fulfil these aims a broad range of information was collected from parents and carers, and 
adolescents themselves. This included diagnostic modules, questions specifically tailored for the 
Australian health care environment and schools, and sections dealing with current practices, 
including the use of the internet. Background information about the environment in which young 
people live and develop, including the functioning of families and mental health of their parents and 
carers, and their experiences at school and online, was also collected. 
Mental disorders were assessed using specific diagnostic modules from the Diagnostic Interview 
Schedule for Children Version IV (DISC-IV) and a specifically developed Impact on Functioning 
module. The DISC-IV is a standardised diagnostic instrument developed under the auspices of the 
United States National Institute of Mental Health, which is used worldwide to assess mental disorders 
in large samples. Disorder status is determined according to the criteria of the Diagnostic and 
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Version IV (DSM-IV), which is the diagnostic classification system 
used clinically world-wide. DISC-IV modules for seven disorders were included in the survey:  
 
Anxiety disorders: Social phobia, separation anxiety disorder, generalised anxiety disorder 
and obsessive-compulsive disorder; 
 
Major depressive disorder; 
 
Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD); and 
 
Conduct disorder. 
1.2 
Who conducted the survey? 
The Australian Government Department of Health funded Young Minds Matter and commissioned The 
University of Western Australia to undertake the survey through the Telethon Kids Institute in 
partnership with Roy Morgan Research. Data were collected between June 2013 and April 2014 by 
trained interviewers.

The survey was developed with guidance from a Survey Reference Group, comprising over 20 experts 
in mental health for children and adolescents (spanning the health, education and community 
sectors), as well as consumer and community representatives. 
1.3 
Who was surveyed? 
The survey aimed to collect information from 5,500 randomly sampled families who had children and 
adolescents aged 4-17 years from across the country, with the exception of very remote areas. An 
additional random sample of 800 families with adolescents aged 16-17 years was also undertaken to 
enable specific estimates to be produced for this age group. In total 76,606 households were 
approached and those eligible households with children in the age range were visited up to a 
maximum of six times to make contact with the household. 
Area based sampling was used to select both samples and where there was more than one child in a 
household, a child was selected at random by a computer. 
In total 6,310 parents and carers or 55% of eligible households responded and 2,967 or 89% young 
people aged 11-17 years in those households for whom their parents or carers had given permission 
also completed a questionnaire. 
Analyses showed the sample to be representative of Australian children and adolescents aged 4-17 
years on the basis of the age and sex of the child, family structure, parental education, income and 
employment, housing tenure and country of birth of both children and adolescents and their parents 
and carers. 
1.4 
What were they asked? 
The survey was based on a face-to-face interview with the parent or primary carer for each selected 
child. When the selected child was aged 11 years or older, they were also invited to complete a 
confidential questionnaire on a tablet computer. 
The parent and carer interview comprised the following modules: 
 
Demographics; 
 
Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children (DISC-IV) modules; 
 
Level of functional impairment; 
 
Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ); 
 
Use of services and perceived need for services; 
 
Education; and 
 
Family characteristics, including measures of parental mental health and family 
functioning. 
The youth questionnaire comprised the following modules: 
 
DISC-IV major depressive disorder module; 
 
Presence of symptoms of psychosis; 
 
Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ); 
 20 
The Mental Health of Children and Adolescents 
 
An enhanced version of the Kessler 10 Psychological Distress Scale (K10+); 
 
Use of services and perceived need for services; 
 
Use of internet and electronic games; 
 
Youth health-risk behaviours, including self-harm, suicidal behaviours, substance use, 
problem eating behaviours and sexual behaviour; 
 
Experience of bullying; 
 
Level of education; and 
 
Level of self-esteem. 
1.5 
Strengths and limitations of the survey 
The survey provides estimates of the prevalence of mental disorders in children and adolescents in 
Australia using a methodology that assesses these against the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria used in most 
clinical settings. For the purposes of the survey seven DISC-IV modules were used, assessing seven 
mental disorders. The most recent version of the DISC-IV, however, is able to address more than 30 
psychiatric diagnoses. This has had a three-fold effect. Firstly, prevalence data are not available for 
less common mental disorders. Secondly, there is an underestimation of the comorbidity of disorders, 
as some young people who participated in the survey may have had other mental disorders not 
covered. Finally, the overall prevalence of mental disorders among children and adolescents is an 
underestimate. From evidence of other surveys both in Australia and internationally, these seven 
disorders are the most common disorders. So, while the exact level of this underestimation is unable 
to be determined, it is considered to be small in relation to the overall prevalence. 
International, standardised instruments for the assessment of mental disorders and mental health 
problems have been used whenever possible. These include the DISC-IV, the Strengths and Difficulties 
Questionnaire (SDQ) and the Kessler 10. This will facilitate international comparability of the results, 
and will allow for the data to be analysed together with that of other Australian surveys and data 
collections.  
Additional questions have been added to the survey to improve its applicability to the Australian 
context, particularly in relation to use of services. These questions have been written specifically for 
this survey to be relevant to the Australian health and education context. 
While it is possible to provide data on primary and secondary school-aged children, the sample was 
not large enough to provide prevalence data or support further disaggregation of data for single year 
age groups. 
In spite of systematic efforts to improve approaches to households, reduce refusals and provide 
incentives for participation, the 55% response rate was lower than expected, and lower than the 70% 
achieved in the 1998 survey. However, there is little evidence of any systematic biases and the results 
are considered to be statistically representative of Australian children and adolescents aged 4-17 
years.

Presentation of data and scope of the report 
This report provides the main summary results from Young Minds Matter. 
   
 
 
 
The Mental Health of Children and Adolescents 
21 
 
 
Standard statistical and reporting protocols have been observed throughout the report, and the data 
processed, analysed and presented as follows: 
 
Data from both the main sample and oversample of 16 and 17 year-olds have been 
combined into a single data set and weighted appropriately to represent the population of 
children and adolescents aged 4-17 years in Australia. 
 
The data have been collated from the responses by parents and carers, and adolescents 
aged 11-17 years. When they are from adolescent self-reports this has been noted. 
 
Where table cells were based on less than five individuals, the data have been suppressed. 
 
The 95% confidence intervals for all data have been examined and only those differences 
that are statistically significant (i.e. not likely to be due to chance) with this level of 
confidence have been highlighted in the text. 
The report includes estimates of the number of children and adolescents who have mental disorders 
and social and emotional problems. The primary findings on the prevalence of mental disorders 
presented in Chapter 2 and data on the four specific types of disorders covered in Chapters 3 to 6 are 
based on the reports of the parent or primary carer for each child. Prevalence of major depressive 
disorder based on the reports of young people themselves is included in Chapter 10. 
A particular focus of the survey was on the use of services in the health and education sectors. Service 
use, by health service providers, in schools, telephone and online services are covered in Chapter 7 
and Chapter 13 presents what young people reported about what they used, also including informal 
supports. Further information on the role of schools is provided in Chapter 9. 
The survey included an assessment by each primary carer of whether they felt their child needed help 
or support for any emotional or behavioural problems, what support or services they received, and 
whether they felt the support met their children’s needs. Where parents or carers identified needs that 
were not being met, the survey sought to identify the reasons or barriers for not seeking or receiving 
further services. This information on perceived need is covered in Chapter 8. 
Self-harm and suicidality, and the use of alcohol and other drugs, and problem eating behaviours, as 
reported by young people themselves, are covered in Chapters 11 and 12.  
The Appendix provides more detailed information on the methodology and technical issues, as well 
as further information on access to online tables and the Confidentialised Unit Record File, which is 
available subject to the necessary approvals through the Australian Data Archive.

Prevalence of mental 
disorders in children and 
adolescents 
 
 
A key aim of the survey was to provide current estimates of the 
prevalence of mental disorders in Australian children and adolescents. 
Parents and carers were asked to complete a questionnaire with a trained 
interviewer consisting of 22 modules. This included a number of 
diagnostic modules to determine the prevalence of mental disorders in 
children and adolescents. 
The Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children Version IV (DISC-IV) is a 
validated tool for identifying mental disorders in children and 
adolescents according to criteria specified in the Diagnostic and 
Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders Version IV (DSM-IV). The DISC-IV 
was the main tool used to assess mental disorders in children and 
adolescents. Modules from the DISC-IV administered to parents and 
carers included: 
 Anxiety disorders 
 Social phobia 
 Separation anxiety disorder 
 Generalised anxiety disorder 
 Obsessive-compulsive disorder 
 Major depressive disorder 
 Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder 
 Conduct disorder 
Responses from parents and carers provided the information necessary 
for diagnoses of each of these mental disorders according to the DSM-IV 
diagnostic classification, as well as a measure of the impact of these 
disorders.

OVERVIEW OF MENTAL DISORDERS (DISC-IV) 
Diagnostic modules from the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children Version IV (DISC-IV) were used 
to assess the seven most common and disabling mental disorders experienced by children and 
adolescents. These included major depressive disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder 
(ADHD), conduct disorder, and four anxiety disorders. Anxiety is not a single disorder, but a class of 
disorders, and children and adolescents were assessed for the four anxiety disorders that are most 
common and cause the greatest distress, namely: social phobia, separation anxiety, generalised 
anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorder. The DISC-IV is a standardised instrument used worldwide 
and developed under the auspices of the United States National Institute of Mental Health. It was 
used in the first child and adolescent survey in Australia in 1998 and again in this survey to assess the 
prevalence of mental disorders and the severity of impact of these on Australian children and 
adolescents. 
2.1  
Overall prevalence of mental disorders in children and adolescents 
In the 12 months prior to the survey around one in seven (13.9%) children and adolescents aged 4-17 
years experienced a mental disorder (Table 2-1). This is equivalent to an estimated 560,000 Australian 
children and adolescents. 
ADHD was the most common mental disorder overall, with 7.4% of children and adolescents assessed 
as having ADHD in the previous 12 months. Anxiety disorders were the next most common (6.9%), 
followed by major depressive disorder (2.8%) and conduct disorder (2.1%).  
2.1.1 
Sex and age differences 
The prevalence of mental disorders varied considerably between males and females, with 16.3% of 
males and 11.5% of females having had a mental disorder in the previous 12 months. 
The difference between the sexes was mainly due to the higher prevalence of ADHD in males (10.4% 
compared with 4.3% for females). Conduct disorder was also more common in males (2.5%) than 
females (1.6%). However, the rate of depression was slightly higher in females (3.1% compared with 
2.5% in males). There was little difference in the prevalence of anxiety disorders.

The Mental Health of Children and Adolescents 
 
There were some distinct differences in the prevalence of disorders between children and adolescents 
(Table 2-2). 
ADHD continued to be the most common disorder for males into their teen years (10.9% for 4-11 year-
olds and 9.8% for 12-17 year-olds), but the prevalence halved for females (5.4% for 4-11 year-olds to 
2.7% for 12-17 year-olds). 
The prevalence of major depressive disorder was higher in adolescents compared to those aged 4-11 
years for both sexes. Among those aged 4-11 years prevalence was almost the same at 1.2% for 
females and 1.1% for males. However, among adolescents the prevalence of major depressive 
disorder was 5.8% for females and 4.3% for males.

Social and demographic characteristics 
Several socio-demographic characteristics were examined for their association with the prevalence of 
mental disorders. These included family type, household income, level of parent and carer education, 
parent and carer labour force status, area of residence and family functioning. Table 2-3 to Table 2-8 
show the relationships of these characteristics to the prevalence of mental disorders.  
Children and adolescents in low-income families, with parents and carers with lower levels of 
education and with higher levels of unemployment had higher rates of mental disorders in the 
previous 12 months. There was also a strong relationship with where they lived with higher rates of 
mental disorders in non-metropolitan areas. This was particularly evident in males. However, while it 
is possible to identify sub-groups in which the prevalence of mental disorders is relatively high, it is 
not possible to draw conclusions about the causal relationships between these demographic 
characteristics and mental illness, or to exclude the possibility that the association may be due to 
another factor with which both are associated.  
2.2.1 
Family type 
Table 2-3 shows the prevalence of mental disorders for children and adolescents in different types of 
families. Young people in step, blended and one parent or carer families had higher rates of mental 
disorders than young people living in original families, that is where at least one child was living with 
both their natural, adoptive or foster parents and there were no step children. The prevalence was 
higher for males than females in both two parent and one parent families.

2.2.2 
Household income 
Table 2-4 shows the association of the prevalence of mental disorders with income. Children and 
adolescents in families in the lowest income bracket (less than $52,000 per year or $1,000 per week) 
had the highest rate of mental disorders in the previous 12 months, with this being almost double that 
of young people in the highest income bracket ($130,000 or more per year or $2,500 or more per week) 
(24.4% and 12.3% respectively in males and 16.1% and 8.8% respectively in females).

Table 2-5 shows the highest level of education of either the young person’s primary or secondary 
parent or carer where present. 
Males from families where the highest level of education of either parent or carer was year 10 or below 
had the highest rates of mental disorders in the previous 12 months (26.2%). This was over twice as 
high as females in the same category (12.7%) and males whose primary and/or secondary parent or 
carer had a bachelor or higher degree (12.5%).

Parent and carer labour force status 
Children and adolescents with no parents or carers in employment had higher rates of mental 
disorders than children and adolescents living in households with one or both parents or carers in 
employment (Table 2-6). The highest rates of mental disorder were in families in which the sole parent 
or carer was not in employment, where 29.6% of children and adolescents had mental disorders in 
the previous 12 months. The rate was markedly less when the sole parent or carer was employed 
(17.0%).

Area of residence 
Children and adolescents who lived outside of the greater capital city areas had higher rates of mental 
disorders compared with those living in other areas (Table 2-7). This was particularly so for males, 
with almost one in five (19.6%) young males residing outside of the greater capital city areas having 
had a mental disorder in the previous 12 months.

Family functioning 
A shortened version of the general functioning subscale of the McMaster Family Assessment Device 
was used to assess the level of family functioning. This covers issues such as communication and 
planning within the family, dealing with conflict, and levels of emotional and practical support. Of all 
families in the survey 3.7% had a level of family functioning assessed on the McMaster scale as poor, 
indicating unhealthy family functioning likely to require clinical intervention.  
Table 2-8 shows that the prevalence of mental disorders increased with decreasing levels of family 
functioning. Just over one third (35.3%) of young people in families with poor family functioning had a 
mental disorder. However, 15.3% in families with good family functioning and 10.9% in those with 
very good family functioning had a disorder. Similar associations were observed for both sexes.

Impact of mental disorders 
2.3.1 
Severity of impact on functioning 
One of the key aims of the survey was to determine the severity of the impact of mental disorders on 
the functioning of young people and, in particular, how this impact was associated with various facets 
of their lives. The survey measured the severity of impact of mental disorders in four different domains 
of functioning: At school or work, with friends and social activities, on the family and on the children 
themselves. This information also allowed estimating the overall severity of impact of mental 
disorders across all of these domains. Severity of impact was classified to be mild, moderate or 
severe. To ease interpretation, throughout this publication, the terms “severity of impact on function”, 
“severity of impact”, and “severity of disorder” or just “severity” will be used interchangeably, or the 
phrases mild disorder, moderate disorder and severe disorder will be used. 
Overall 13.9% of children and adolescents aged 4-17 years had mental disorders with 8.3% having 
mild severity of impact, 3.5% had moderate severity of impact and 2.1% had severe disorder 
(Table 2-9). 
For children with anxiety disorders, ADHD and conduct disorder the majority of these had a mild 
impact on functioning, with fewer that were moderate and fewer again severe. However, the converse 
was true with major depressive disorder, with the largest proportion of children (42.9% of those with 
major depressive disorder or 1.2% of all 4-17 year-olds) classified as having a severe impact, less as 
moderate (1.0% of 4-17 year-olds) and less again as mild (0.6% of 4-17 year-olds).

Three fifths (59.8%) of children and adolescents with a mental disorder had disorders with a mild 
impact on functioning, one quarter (25.4%) were moderate, and 14.7% were assessed as severe. There 
was little difference in the proportions of males and females at each level of impact. There were, 
however, marked differences between children and adolescents, with almost three times as many 
adolescents as children with mental disorders with severe impact (23.1% for 12-17 year-olds 
compared with 8.2% for 4-11 year-olds). In contrast, far more children had disorders with mild impact 
than adolescents (72.1% of 4-11 year-olds compared with 44.1% of 12-17 year-olds) (Table 2-10).

When children and adolescents had mental disorders, slightly more of these disorders had a severe 
impact in the domains of family and school or work than in the domains of friends and self (19.5% and 
17.6% compared with 12.4% and 14.4% respectively). Overall 15.0% of children and adolescents with 
mental disorders had no impact on functioning in the domain of school or work, 26.5% had no impact 
in the friends domain, 14.4% had no impact in the family domain, and 14.8% had no impact on self

Days absent from school 
Where parents or carers reported symptoms of mental disorders in their children, they were asked 
how many days in the previous 12 months the child or adolescent was absent from school due to 
those symptoms. Because of the way the questions were asked it was not possible to calculate the 
total number of days absent from school due to any mental disorder if the child or adolescent had 
more than one disorder. Major depressive disorder was associated with the highest average number 
of days absent from school (20 days), followed by anxiety disorders (12 days), conduct disorder (8 
days) and ADHD (5 days) (Table 2-12).

Comorbidity 
Children and adolescents may experience more than one mental disorder within the same time 
period and this is referred to as comorbidity. Of the 13.9% of children and adolescents diagnosed with 
a mental disorder almost one third (30.0% or 4.2% of all 4-17 year-olds) had two or more disorders at 
some time in the previous 12 months. For this purpose the class of anxiety disorders have been 
considered as a single disorder and children could have a maximum of four disorders. 
Over half of the children and adolescents with major depressive disorder (1.6% of all 4-17 year-olds) 
also had an anxiety disorder (Figure 2-1). Two thirds of the children and adolescents with conduct 
disorder also had another disorder (1.4% out of the 2.1% of all 4-17 year-olds with conduct disorders). 
One third of the children and adolescents with either anxiety disorders or major depressive disorder 
also had conduct disorder or ADHD in the previous 12 months (2.6% out of the 8.1% of all 4-17 year-
olds with either or both). A small proportion of children and adolescents (0.4%) experienced three

classes of mental disorder (anxiety disorders or major depressive disorder, ADHD and conduct 
disorder) in the previous 12 months (Figure 2-2).

Principal condition 
When a child or adolescent was found to have experienced more than one disorder in the previous 12 
months, his or her parent or carer was asked which of the disorders caused the most distress to the 
child. This approach allows each person to be uniquely assigned to a principal condition. 
ADHD and anxiety disorders were the most commonly identified principal conditions but their relative 
importance differed for males and females. ADHD was the most common principal condition for 
males (7.9%), while anxiety disorders were the most common principal condition for females (5.1%). 
Males and females had comparable rates of anxiety disorders (5.6% compared with 5.1%), major 
depressive disorder (1.6% compared with 2.4%) and conduct disorder (1.1% compared with 1.0%). 
However ADHD was more common identified as the principal condition in males than females (7.9% 
compared with 3.1%) (Table 2-13).

ADHD and anxiety disorders were both commonly identified as the principal condition for children

aged 12-17 years (Table 2-14).

MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER 
This chapter presents data on children and adolescents who met diagnostic criteria as specified in 
DSM-IV for major depressive disorder based on information reported by parents and carers. The 
prevalence of major depressive disorder based on information reported by young people themselves 
is presented in Chapter 10. 
Major depressive disorder 
The key feature of major depressive disorder is the presence of either depressed mood, loss of 
interest or pleasure or being grouchy, irritable and in a bad mood. The DSM-IV criteria specify 
that at least five symptoms of depression must be present for a minimum of a two-week period, 
that these symptoms cause clinically significant distress to the child or adolescent and that 
they must interfere with the child or adolescent’s normal functioning at school, at home or in 
social settings. Symptoms of major depressive disorder may include significant weight loss or 
weight gain, loss of appetite, insomnia or hypersomnia, restlessness, fatigue and loss of energy, 
feelings of worthlessness and inability to concentrate. 
3.1 
Prevalence of major depressive disorder in children and adolescents 
Overall 2.8% of children and adolescents aged 4-17 years met diagnostic criteria for major depressive 
disorder (Table 3-1). This corresponds to an estimated 112,000 children and adolescents in Australia 
with major depressive disorder. The prevalence of major depressive disorder in children aged 4-11 
years was 1.1% in males and 1.2% in females. The prevalence of major depressive disorder was higher 
in the older age group. Some 4.3% of males 12-17 years and 5.8% of females 12-17 years had major 
depressive disorder.

Social and demographic characteristics 
Table 3-2 through Table 3-7 show the 12-month prevalence of major depressive disorder by a range of 
socio-demographic characteristics, including family type, household income, parent or carer 
education and labour force status, area of residence and family functioning. Overall prevalence of 
depression was higher in children and adolescents living in families with lower levels of income, 
education and employment and with poorer family functioning.

The prevalence of major depressive disorder was lowest in original families (1.7%), that is where at 
least one child was living with both their natural, adoptive or foster parents and there were no step 
children. The prevalence of major depressive disorder was higher for young people in step families 
(4.7%), and in families with just one parent or carer (5.5%) (Table 3-2).

Impact of major depressive disorder 
Mental disorders impact on young people in a number of ways across different aspects of their lives. 
The severity that symptoms of major depressive disorders had across four different life domains are 
reported as well as the number of days absent from school in the previous 12 months as a result of 
major depressive disorder symptoms. 
3.3.1 
Severity of impact on functioning 
3.3.1 
Severity of impact on functioning 
The severity of major depressive disorder in four different domains (school or work, friends and social 
activities, family and self) and overall is reported in Table 3-8. Two fifths (40.3%) of 4-17 year-olds 
experienced a severe level of impact on self (that is, where the young person experienced a severe 
level of distress due to their symptoms). A third (34.3%) of children and adolescents experienced a 
severe level of impact in the school or work domain. Overall two fifths (42.8%) of 4-17 year-olds with 
major depressive disorder experienced a severe level of impact. This was the highest proportion of 
severe cases among those with a disorder of any of the disorders measured in the survey. 
Compared with other disorders, a higher proportion of children and adolescents with major 
depressive disorder had severe impact in the self, friends and school/work domains (40.3%, 23.4% 
and 34.3% respectively). A large proportion of young people with social phobia also had severe 
impact in the friends’ domain (23.4%) while a large proportion with obsessive-compulsive disorder 
had severe impact in the school/work domain (33.0%).

Days absent from school 
Approximately three quarters (74%) of children and adolescents with major depressive disorder 
attending school had been absent from school for one or more days in the previous 12 months due to 
their depressive symptoms.  
Young people with major depressive disorder averaged 20 days absent from school in the previous 12 
months due to their depressive symptoms. The average was higher for adolescents, with those aged 
4-11 years averaging 14 days absent compared with an average of 23 days absent for young people 
aged 12-17 years (Table 3-9). Compared to other disorders, children and adolescents with major 
depressive disorder missed on average the most days of school due to their symptoms.

ANXIETY DISORDERS 
This chapter presents data on children and adolescents who met diagnostic criteria identified in DSM-
IV for social phobia, separation anxiety disorder, generalised anxiety disorder or obsessive-compulsive 
disorder. 
Anxiety disorders refers to a group of conditions rather than a single disorder. The common 
characteristic of the conditions that make up this category is that individuals affected experience 
persistent, excessive worry or fears that typically interferes with their ability to carry out their daily 
tasks or take pleasure in day-to-day life. It is common for young people to be fearful and anxious, but 
some may be more anxious than other children of their age and developmental level, and this may 
stop them participating in activities at school or socially, or interfere with their ability to do what other 
children and adolescents of their age do. 
Social phobia  
This disorder is characterised by a marked and persistent fear or avoidance of social or 
performance situations in which embarrassment may occur. To meet DSM-IV criteria, the fear or 
avoidance must interfere significantly with the child or adolescent’s normal routine, academic 
functioning, or social activities or relationships, or the person must experience marked distress 
about the phobia. 
Separation anxiety disorder 
This disorder is characterised by excessive anxiety concerning separation from the home or 
from those to whom the child is attached. To meet DSM-IV criteria, the anxiety must be beyond 
that which is expected for the child or adolescent’s developmental level, and cause significant 
distress in social, academic or other important areas of functioning. While separation anxiety 
disorder may be more common in younger children it can cause significant impairment in older 
children. 
Generalised anxiety disorder 
This disorder is characterised by excessive anxiety, worry or apprehension about a number of 
different events or activities, occurring more days than not for a period of at least six months. 
DSM-IV criteria specify that for children the anxiety must be associated with at least one of the 
following symptoms: restlessness or feeling keyed up or on edge, being easily fatigued, difficulty 
concentrating or mind going blank, irritability, muscle tension or sleep disturbance. The 
constant worry causes distress to the individual. The child or adolescent has difficulty 
controlling the worry, and experiences impairment in social, academic or other important areas 
of functioning. 
 42 
The Mental Health of Children and Adolescents 
 
Obsessive-compulsive disorder 
Key features of this disorder are recurrent obsessions and/or compulsions that are severe 
enough to be time consuming and cause marked distress or significant impairment. Obsessions 
are persistent ideas, thoughts, impulses or images that are intrusive and difficult to control and 
that cause anxiety or distress. Common obsessions include worrying about things being dirty or 
having germs, or that the person might do something bad in public. Compulsions are repetitive 
behaviours, such as washing hands or changing clothes over and over, repetitively checking 
things, or counting or ordering things over and over. To meet DSM-IV criteria the obsessions or 
compulsions must cause marked distress, be time consuming or significantly interfere with the 
child or adolescent’s normal routine, academic functioning, usual social activities or 
relationships. 
 
The survey focussed on the four anxiety disorders that are most common and cause greatest distress 
in children and adolescents. These were social phobia, separation anxiety disorder, generalised 
anxiety disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder. 
4.1 
Prevalence of anxiety disorders in children and adolescents 
Half of all children and adolescents aged 4-17 years with mental disorders had an anxiety disorder. 
This is equivalent to 6.9% of all children and adolescents or an estimated 278,000 children and 
adolescents. There was little difference between males and females (7.0% and 6.8%). 
The prevalence of anxiety disorders was very similar in children and adolescents, with 6.9% of 
children aged 4-11 years and 7.0% of young people aged 12-17 years having one or more anxiety 
disorders (Table 4-1). However, there were differences between children and adolescents in the 
prevalence of individual anxiety disorders. Separation anxiety disorder was the most common 
anxiety disorder in children (4.9% of those 4-11 years). Among adolescents both social phobia and 
separation anxiety disorder were equally common (3.4%) and generalised anxiety disorder was 
almost as common (2.9%). 
Among children aged 4-11 years, the prevalence of anxiety disorders was slightly but not significantly 
higher in males than females (7.6% compared with 6.1%) due mainly to the higher prevalence of 
obsessive-compulsive disorder in males in this age group. Among young people aged 12-17 years, the 
prevalence of anxiety disorders was slightly but not significantly higher in females than males (7.7% 
compared with 6.3%) due mainly to the higher prevalence of generalised anxiety disorder in females 
in this age group.

Social and demographic characteristics 
The relationships between parental, family and household characteristics and anxiety disorders are 
shown in Table 4-2 through to Table 4-7. Overall, the prevalence of anxiety disorders was higher in 
children and adolescents living in families with lower levels of income, education and employment 
and with poorer family functioning. 
4.2.1 
Family type 
4.2.1 
Family type 
For three of the four anxiety disorders the prevalence was higher in families with one parent or 
carer than families with two parents or carers. Except for obsessive-compulsive disorder, 
prevalence was lower in original families, that is where at least one child lives with both their 
natural, adoptive or foster parents and there were no step children, compared with step or 
blended families. Of children or adolescents living in families with one parent or carer, 9.0% had 
separation anxiety disorder compared with 2.7% in original families, 5.7% in step families and 
4.8% in blended families (Table 4-2).

4.2.2 
Household income 
The prevalence of anxiety disorders was highest in families with the lowest incomes, with the rates of 
each of the anxiety disorders being almost double in households with incomes below $52,000 per year 
($1,000 per week) than in families with higher household incomes (Table 4-3).

Parent and carer education 
There was no association between parent and carer education and obsessive-compulsive disorder. 
However, for each of the other anxiety disorders the lowest prevalence was in families where at 
least one parent or carer had a bachelor degree or higher. The highest prevalence occurred in 
families where the highest level of education achieved by either parent or carer was Year 10 or 
below (Table 4-4).

In families with two parents or carers, the prevalence of all four anxiety disorders was lower where 
both parents or carers were currently in employment (Table 4-5). Among children and adolescents 
living in households with a sole parent or carer, separation anxiety disorder was more common where 
the parent or carer was not in employment (13.6% compared with 5.8%).

Family functioning 
Table 4-7 shows the relationship between family functioning and the prevalence of anxiety disorders 
in children and adolescents. There was a strong relationship between level of family functioning and 
the prevalence of separation anxiety disorder, with 12.9% of children aged 4-11 years living in families 
with poor family functioning having separation anxiety disorder as compared with 3.8% of children 
living in families with very good functioning. Similarly 10.4% of 12-17 year-olds in families with poor 
family functioning had separation anxiety disorder, compared with 3.0% of 12-17 year-olds in families 
with very good family functioning.

Impact of anxiety disorders 
Mental disorders impact on young people in a number of ways across different aspects of their lives. 
The severity that symptoms of anxiety disorders had across four different life domains are reported as 
well as the number of days absent from school in the previous 12 months as a result of anxiety 
disorder symptoms. 
4.3.1 
Severity of impact on functioning 
4.3.1 
Severity of impact on functioning 
The severity of anxiety disorders in four different domains (school or work, friends and social activities, 
family and self) and overall is reported in Table 4-8. Overall 18.7% of children and adolescents with 
anxiety disorders had a severe disorder, while 27.5% had a moderate disorder. 
The type and severity of impact varied considerably between the four anxiety disorders. There was a 
lower proportion of cases with severe impact in each domain for separation anxiety compared with 
the other anxiety disorders. Obsessive-compulsive disorder was the disorder with the largest 
proportion of cases experiencing severe impact across the functioning domains with the exception of 
friends. 
In contrast to other disorders, a higher proportion of children and adolescents with social phobia had 
severe impact in the friends domain (23.4%) while a high proportion with generalised anxiety had 
severe impact in the family domain (30.9). A high proportion of children and adolescents with 
obsessive-compulsive disorder also had severe impact in the school/work domain and family 
domains (33.0% and 37.4% respectively).

Most children and adolescents in the survey were attending school (94%). Over half of 4-11 year-olds 
(58%) and almost three quarters of 12-17 year-olds (73%) attending school who had an anxiety 
disorder were absent from school for at least one day in the previous 12 months due to their anxiety 
symptoms. The average number of days absent from school due to anxiety symptoms was more than 
double in 12-17 year olds compared with 4-11 year-olds (20 days compared with 6 days) (Table 4-9).

ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER 
This chapter presents data on children and adolescents who met diagnostic criteria identified in DSM-
IV for Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). 
Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder 
ADHD is a persistent pattern of inattention and/ or hyperactivity-impulsivity more frequent and 
severe than in other individuals at a similar developmental stage. Children and adolescents 
may find it difficult to pay attention and see tasks or activities through to the end or make 
careless mistakes with school work or other tasks. Children and adolescents with problems in 
the area of hyperactivity may talk excessively, have trouble staying still when it is appropriate or 
expected and act like they are always “on the go”. 
There are three subtypes of ADHD based on the most common symptoms. Those with mostly 
inattentive symptoms are diagnosed with ADHD, predominantly inattentive type and 
individuals with primarily hyperactivity-impulsivity symptoms are diagnosed with ADHD, 
predominantly hyperactive-impulsive type. Those children and adolescence with symptoms of 
both inattentiveness and hyperactivity are diagnosed with ADHD, combined type. 
The DSM-IV criteria require at least six symptoms of either inattention or hyperactivity-
impulsivity to have persisted for at least 6 months to a degree that is maladaptive and 
inconsistent with developmental level. Symptoms must be present in at least two settings (e.g. 
at school and at home), and some symptoms causing impairment must have been present 
before the age of 7 years. 
5.1 
Prevalence of ADHD in children and adolescents 
In the 12 months prior to the survey 7.4% of children and adolescents had ADHD, equivalent to an 
estimated 298,000 children and adolescents across Australia (Table 5-1). 
Of the three sub-types of ADHD, inattentive type was the most common, with 3.4% of children and 
adolescents having inattentive type, 1.2% hyperactive type and 2.8% combined type. The tables in 
this chapter report data which includes all three subtypes of ADHD.  
The prevalence of ADHD was higher in males than females, with more than twice as many males as 
females having had ADHD in the previous 12 months (10.4% compared with 4.3%). The prevalence of 
ADHD was lower in adolescent females compared with females aged 4-11 years (2.7% compared with 
5.4%). There was little difference in the prevalence between males from either age group; 10.9% of 
males aged 4-11 years and 9.8% of males aged 12-17 years had ADHD (Table 5-1).

Social and demographic characteristics 
Table 5-2 through to Table 5-6 report the prevalence of ADHD by a range of socio-demographic 
characteristics. These include family type, household income, carer education and labour force 
status, area of residence and family functioning. Overall prevalence of ADHD was higher in children 
and adolescents living in families with lower levels of income, education and employment and with 
poorer family functioning. 
5.2.1  
Family type 
5.2.1  
Family type 
The lowest prevalence of ADHD was in children and adolescents living in original families (5.7%), that 
is where at least one child was living with both their natural, adoptive or foster parents and there were 
no step children. The prevalence of ADHD was twice as high in children and adolescents from lone 
parent or carer families (11.1%) and slightly higher again (13.4%) in those from blended families 
(Table 5-2).

5.2.2  
Household income 
5.2.2  
Household income 
The prevalence of ADHD was highest in children and adolescents in households in the lowest income 
bracket (less than $52,000 per year or $1,000 per week), with just over one in ten (11.7%) young people 
who lived in these households having had ADHD in the previous 12 months (Table 5-3). This was 
significantly higher than the prevalence of children and adolescents in households in the middle and 
highest income brackets (6.6% and 5.2% respectively).

5.2.3  
Parent and carer education 
Children and adolescents from families in which the highest level of education of a parent or carer 
was a bachelor degree or higher had the lowest prevalence of ADHD. In contrast, children and 
adolescents from families where the highest level of education of either parent or carer was Year 10 or 
below had the highest prevalence of ADHD (5.4% compared with 11.7%) (Table 5-4).

both parents or carers were employed and highest where no parent or carer in the household was 
employed (Table 5-5). The prevalence of ADHD in children and adolescents with both parents or 
carers not in employment was twice as high (15.6%) as children or adolescents in families where one 
parent or carer was employed (7.0%). For children and adolescents with a sole parent or carer, 
prevalence rates for ADHD were 15.3% where the sole carer was not in employment, double the rate 
where the parent or carer was employed (7.7%).

There was a strong relationship between level of family functioning and prevalence of ADHD. Just 
under one fifth (18.1%) of children and adolescents living in families with poor family functioning had 
ADHD compared with one in twenty (5.6%) living in families with very good family functioning. This 
pattern was most obvious in children 4-11 years but was also evident in adolescents aged 12-17 years 
(Table 5-7).

Impact of ADHD 
Mental disorders impact on young people in a number of ways across different aspects of their lives. 
The severity of symptoms of ADHD across four different life domains are reported as well as the 
number of days absent from school in the previous 12 months as a result of ADHD disorder symptoms. 
5.3.1 
Severity of impact on functioning 
5.3.1 
Severity of impact on functioning 
The severity of impact of ADHD on children and adolescents in four different domains (school or work, 
friends and social actives, family and impact on self) and overall is reported in Table 5-8. Overall one 
in ten (10.5%) children and adolescents with ADHD had severe impact on functioning in at least one of 
these domains. Severe impact on functioning was reported most commonly in the domain of family 
(17.3%), and then school or work (12.8%). Only 3.7% of children and adolescents with ADHD had a 
severe level of impact on functioning in the self domain (that is, where the young person experienced 
a high level of distress due to their symptoms). Two fifths (40.9%) of children and adolescents with 
ADHD had no impact in the friends domain, while only 13.3% of children with ADHD had no impact in 
the school or work domain.

Table 5-9 reports the average number of days off school in the previous 12 months of those children 
who met diagnostic criteria for ADHD. Just under a third of 4-11 year-olds and a half of 12-17 year-olds 
(29% and 46% respectively) with ADHD had missed at least one day of school in the previous 12 
months due to their ADHD symptoms.  
The average number of days off school due to ADHD was higher for adolescents. On average, children 
aged 4-11 years had 4 days off, while 12-17 year-olds had 9 days off (Table 5-9). Compared to children 
and adolescents with other disorders those with ADHD missed on average the least number of days of 
school due to their ADHD symptoms.

CONDUCT DISORDER AND OPPOSITIONAL PROBLEM 
BEHAVIOURS 
This chapter presents data on children and adolescents that met diagnostic criteria identified in DSM-
IV for conduct disorder. It also presents information on oppositional problem behaviours.  
Conduct disorder 
Conduct disorder is defined as repetitive and persistent behaviour to a degree that violates the 
basic rights of others, major societal norms or rules in the following areas: aggression towards 
people or animals, destruction of property, deceitfulness or theft and serious violation of rules. 
Young people with conduct disorder exhibit a range of behaviours often including bullying, 
frequent physical fights, deliberately destroying other’s property, breaking into properties or 
cars, staying out late at night without permission, running away from home or frequent truancy 
from school. DSM-IV criteria require at least three of these behaviours to have been present in 
the past 12 months, and for the disturbance in behaviour to cause clinically significant 
impairment in social, academic or occupational functioning. 
6.1 
Prevalence of conduct disorder in children and adolescents  
Around 2% of all children and adolescents had conduct disorder. This is equivalent to around 84,000 
children and adolescents across Australia. The prevalence was higher in males than females (2.5% 
compared with 1.6%). The prevalence did not vary across age groups for either sex (Table 6-1).

Social and demographic characteristics  
The 12-month prevalence of conduct disorder by a range of socio-demographic characteristics is 
reported in Table 6-2 to Table 6-7. These include family type, household income, carer education and 
labour force status, area of residence and family functioning. Overall prevalence of conduct disorder 
was higher in children and adolescents living in families with lower levels of income, education and 
employment and with poorer family functioning.

6.2.1 
Family type 
The prevalence of conduct disorders was lowest (1.0%) in original families, that is where at least one 
child was living with both their natural, adoptive or foster parents and there were no step children. 
The highest prevalences were in families with one parent or carer and step families, in which 4.8% and 
4.4% of children and adolescents had conduct disorder respectively (Table 6-2).

Household income 
The prevalence of conduct disorder was associated with household income (Table 6-3). Children and 
adolescents from families in the highest income bracket, with incomes of $130,000 or more per year, 
had the lowest prevalence of conduct disorder (0.8%). Over four times as many children and 
adolescents from families in the lowest income bracket (less than $52,000 per year) had conduct 
disorder compared with families in the highest income bracket (4.3% compared with 0.8%).

was 4.6% in children and adolescents in households where both parents or carers were not in 
employment. In households with a sole parent or carer, where the parent or carer was in employment, 
the prevalence was lower at 2.8%, however, it was almost three times (7.9%) higher for children and 
adolescents in families in which the sole parent or carer was not in employment.

Impact of conduct disorder 
Mental disorders impact on young people in a number of ways across different aspects of their lives. 
The severity that symptoms of conduct disorder had across four different life domains are reported as 
well as the number of days absent from school in the previous 12 months as a result of conduct 
disorder symptoms.

Severity of impact on functioning 
6.3.1 
Severity of impact on functioning 
The severity of conduct disorder on children and adolescent’s functioning was assessed in four 
different domains (school or work, friends and social activities, family and self) and overall. Overall 
18.9% of children and adolescents with conduct disorder had severe disorder. The family domain was 
most severely affected by conduct disorder, with nearly one third (29.5%) of children or adolescents 
with conduct disorder having severe impact in the family domain (Table 6-8). Only 4.3% of children or 
adolescents with conduct disorder had no impact in the family domain. The self domain (that is, 
where the young person experienced distress due to their symptoms) showed the smallest proportion 
of children or adolescents with severe impact (3.6%). 
In comparison to other disorders, a higher proportion of children and adolescents with conduct 
disorder had severe impact in the family domain (29.5%). A large proportion of families with young 
people who had generalised anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorder also had severe impact in the 
family domain (30.9% and 37.4% respectively).

symptoms of their conduct disorder. 
The average number of days missed of school was higher in 12-17 year-olds than 4-11 year-olds (Table 
6-9). Children aged 4-11 years missed an average of two days in the previous 12 months, while 12-17

Oppositional problem behaviours 
The DSM-IV includes a mental disorder category called oppositional defiant disorder and the DISC-IV 
module for oppositional defiant disorder was included in Young Minds Matter. However, unlike other 
disorders included in this publication, the diagnosis for oppositional defiant disorder includes an 
element of clinical judgement that could not be implemented within the DISC-IV questions. In 
particular, for each symptom assessed in oppositional defiant disorder the DSM-IV specifies that the 
symptom criterion is met only if the behaviour occurs more frequently than is typically observed in 
individuals of comparable age and developmental level. A mental health trained clinician is required 
to make this judgement. The data collection for Young Minds Matter was undertaken by lay 
professional interviewers who were not specifically trained in psychology or psychiatry and expert 
clinical review of each child or adolescent in the survey was not undertaken. As such it was not 
possible to implement all of the diagnostic criteria for oppositional defiant disorder.  
Despite these limitations, information collected in the survey on the prevalence of oppositional 
problem behaviours in children and adolescents is useful for a broad range of purposes. The 
information from parents and carers on oppositional problem behaviours in their children that was 
 62 
The Mental Health of Children and Adolescents 
obtained from the DISC-IV module is presented in this section. These are referred to as oppositional 
problem behaviours to distinguish them from the diagnostic condition of oppositional defiant 
disorder.  
Oppositional problem behaviours 
Oppositional problem behaviours are negativistic, hostile and defiant behaviours lasting at 
least six months characterised by behaviour such as often losing temper, arguing with adults, 
actively defying adults’ requests and rules, being angry, resentful, spiteful or vindictive. 
If a child or adolescent met diagnostic criteria for conduct disorder, the oppositional problem 
behaviours module was not administered for that child or adolescent. 
6.4.1 
Prevalence of oppositional problem behaviours in children and adolescents
6.4.1 
Prevalence of oppositional problem behaviours in children and adolescents 
Around 5.1% of all children and adolescents had oppositional problem behaviours. This is equivalent 
to around 204,000 children and adolescents across Australia. The prevalence was higher in males than 
females (5.6% compared with 4.5%). The prevalence did not vary across age groups for either sex 
(Table 6-10).

Co-occurrence of oppositional problem behaviours and mental disorders 
As conduct disorder is regarded as a more severe form of oppositional problem behaviours, an 
exclusion rule was applied so that no child or adolescent could be given the diagnosis of conduct 
disorder and oppositional problem behaviours. To reduce respondent burden in the survey, parents 
and carers of children or adolescents who met diagnostic criteria for conduct disorder were not asked 
questions about oppositional problem behaviours.  
There was a substantial overlap between oppositional problem behaviours and the group of mental 
disorders included in the survey. Over half of children and adolescents with oppositional problem 
behaviours also met diagnostic criteria for a mental disorder (3.0% of all children and adolescents had 
oppositional problem behaviours and met diagnostic criteria for a mental disorder, and 2.1% had 
oppositional problem behaviours and did not meet diagnostic criteria for any mental disorders). 
Some 1.0% of children and adolescents had oppositional problem behaviours and ADHD, 1.1% had 
oppositional problem behaviours and anxiety or depression, and 0.9% of children and adolescents 
had oppositional problem behaviours and both ADHD and anxiety or depression (Table 6-11).

4.0% of 12-17 year-olds in families with very good family functioning had oppositional problem 
behaviours. In contrast, 18.0% of 4-11 year-olds and 15.5% of 12-17 year-olds had oppositional 
problem behaviours in families with poor family functioning (Table 6-12).

Severity of impact on functioning 
The severity of oppositional problem behaviours on children and adolescent’s functioning was 
assessed in four different domains (school or work, friends and social activities, family and self) and 
overall. The overall impact on functioning was assessed as mild for more than two thirds (68.6%) of 
the children and adolescents with oppositional problem behaviours. One fifth (20.3%) of children and 
adolescents experienced moderate impact and just over one in ten (11.1%) experienced severe 
impact on functioning. 
Family was the domain in which the most children and adolescents with oppositional problem 
behaviours had moderate or severe impact (35.1% moderate, 16.6% severe) (Table 6-13).

Service use 
 
Services used and those felt to be needed by 
children and adolescents for emotional or 
behavioural problems and their families, and 
barriers to seeking and receiving help 
 
 
A key aim of the survey was to determine the services used by children 
and adolescents to assist them with their emotional or behavioural 
problems. Questions were specifically tailored to the current Australian 
health care environment. 
Health services across the full range of settings and by different providers 
are identified and information on services provided by schools is also 
provided in recognition of the important role that the education sector 
plays in providing support for children and adolescents with problems. 
Service use by young people with mental disorders is examined in detail, 
and those who did and did not use services further explored. 
The survey also measured perceived need for care. Specifically this 
identified whether parents and carers felt that their children needed any 
help with emotional or behavioural problems and, if so, whether their 
needs have been fully or partially met by the services they received. 
Where needs were not fully met information was collected on the barriers 
to seeking help or receiving more of the help they felt their children 
needed. 
Parents and carers were asked about the services they had received and 
their need for help for themselves and other family members to deal with 
the emotional and behavioural problems affecting their children.

SERVICE USE 
This chapter presents data provided by parents and carers on the services used by their children and 
adolescents for emotional or behavioural problems. This reflects service use for a range of emotional 
and behavioural problems and for specific mental disorders.  
Children and adolescents use a wide variety of services to support and assist them with emotional or 
behavioural problems. These include health services, school services, telephone counselling and 
online services. A summary measure of 'service use' was created that includes all of these services, but 
online services were limited to those providing structured or personalised assistance. While valuable 
in their own right, online services where information is accessed on the internet but no other service is 
provided were excluded from this composite measure. 
The data presented in this chapter on telephone and online services do not provide a particularly 
accurate picture of the use of telephone and online services. Parents and carers often reported that 
they did not know services of these types that their child or adolescent had used. These data have, 
however, been included with those on health and school services, as together they provide the most 
complete picture of services used by children and adolescents. 
Young people aged 13 years and over were asked directly about the services they used. Their 
responses are reported in Chapter 13 which provides a more accurate picture of young people’s use of 
telephone and online services, not only for counselling and support, but also as an important source 
of information on their emotional and behavioural problems. Young people also reported on the 
informal support for their emotional and behavioural problems that they received from family, friends 
and other significant people in their lives. This is also reported in Chapter 13. 
7.1  
Service use by all children and adolescents  
‘Services’ comprise the following:  
i. 
health services — any service provided by a qualified health professional regardless of 
where that service was provided including in the community, hospital inpatient, outpatient 
and emergency, and private rooms; 
ii. 
school services — any service provided by the school or other educational institution that a 
young person was attending; 
iii. 
telephone counselling services; and 
iv. 
online services that provided personalised assessment, support, counselling or structured 
self-help programs. 
One sixth (17.0%) of all children and adolescents aged 4-17 years had used services for emotional or 
behavioural problems in the previous 12 months (Table 7-1). One in seven (14.8%) of all 4-17 year-olds 
had used services in the health sector, and one in nine (11.5%) had used services provided by schools 
in the previous 12 months for emotional or behavioural problems. According to parents and carers, 
very few had used a telephone counselling service (0.5%) or online personal support or counselling 
(0.1%) for emotional or behavioural problems.

Just over half (53.5%) of 4-17 year-olds who had used services for emotional or behavioural problems 
in the previous 12 months had used both health and school services. About one third (34.5%) had only 
used health services and just under one in eight (12.0%) had only used school services. 
The proportion of males and females using services for emotional and behavioural problems was 
similar, but the proportion was higher among adolescents than children (21.4% for 12-17 year-olds 
compared with 13.7% for 4-11 year-olds) (Table 7-2).

As discussed in Chapter 2, the prevalence of mental disorders among 4-17 year-olds in families with 
one parent or carer was twice that in families with two parents or carers. However, service use for 
emotional and behavioural problems in the previous 12 months was also higher among children or 
adolescents with mental disorders in families with one parent or carer (65.6%) compared with families 
with two parents or carers (51.3%) (Table 7-4). Children and adolescents with mental disorders living 
in blended families were more likely to use services (63.3%) than those living in original (49.4%) or 
step families (44.2%).

Household income 
As reported in Chapter 2, the prevalence of mental disorders among children and adolescents living in 
the lowest income bracket (less than $52,000 per year) was almost double that of those in the highest 
income bracket ($130,000 or more per year). 
Among children and adolescents with mental disorders, service use in the previous 12 months for 
emotional or behavioural problems was higher in the lowest income bracket than the highest income 
bracket (61.9% compared with 50.6% respectively) (Table 7-5).

Parent and carer education 
Rates of mental disorders among 4-17 year-olds were highest when they lived in a family in which the 
highest level of education for either the parent or carer was Year 10 or below as reported in Chapter 2. 
Service use for emotional and behavioural problems in the previous 12 months was also highest in 
these families (62.2%). However, differences in service use by education level of parents and carers 
should be treated with caution as they are not statistically significant (Table 7-6).

As presented in Chapter 2, children and adolescents living in households with no parents or carers in 
employment had higher rates of mental disorders than those living in households with one or both 
parents or carers in employment. Table 7-7 shows rates of service use for emotional or behavioural 
problems by the labour force status of the young person’s parents or carers. 
About two thirds of children and adolescents with mental disorders in families without an employed 
parent or carer (65.0% with both parents or carers not employed and 64.0% in families with a sole 
parent or carer not employed) or in a family where the sole parent or carer was employed (65.4%) had 
used services for emotional or behavioural problems in the previous 12 months. 
Service use was lower among children and adolescents with mental disorders living in families where 
both parents and carers were employed (50.8%), or where one parent or carer was employed (51.5%). 
Differences in service use within two parent or carer families by employment status should be treated 
with caution as they are not statistically significant.

Rates of mental disorders were higher among those living outside of greater capital cities but service 
use for emotional and behavioural problems among 4-17 year-olds with mental disorders was similar 
in greater capital cities and other areas (Table 7-8).

Service use was highest among children and adolescents with a major depressive disorder, with four 
fifths (79.6%) of these children and adolescents having used services in the previous 12 months. Just 
over two thirds (68.8%) of those with a conduct disorder, 61.4% of those with anxiety disorders and 
half (52.7%) of children and adolescents with ADHD had used services. Service use was consistently 
higher among adolescents than children for each type of disorder (Table 7-9).

Health service use by children and adolescents with mental disorders 
This section reports on the use of services provided by health professionals in the community, 
hospital inpatient, outpatient or emergency departments, private rooms and at headspace centres. 
7.3.1  
Type and severity of disorders 
7.3.1  
Type and severity of disorders 
Just over half (53.0%) of 4-17 year-olds with mental disorders had used a health service for emotional 
or behavioural problems in the previous 12 months, with the highest level of health service use among 
those with a major depressive disorder (77.0%) (Table 7-11).  
Most children and adolescents (86.6%) with severe disorders had used health services in the previous 
12 months. Whereas two thirds (68.5%) of those with moderate disorders and 38.1% of those with 
mild disorders had done so.  
The proportion of young people using health services in the previous 12 months was, no matter what 
the type of disorder, consistently high when the disorder was severe, ranging from 90.1% of those with 
severe conduct disorders down to 86.4% of those with severe major depressive disorder. Service use 
by those with moderate disorders was also relatively high, ranging between 72.0% and 80.2% in the 
previous 12 months. There was, however, more variation for mild disorders, with health service use in 
the previous 12 months being lowest for mild ADHD (37.0%) and mild anxiety disorders (40.2%), but 
up to 57.1% for those with mild major depressive disorder.

Health service providers 
7.3.2  
Health service providers 
Just over half (52.6%) of children and adolescents with mental disorders had seen a health service 
provider in the previous 12 months for emotional or behavioural problems (Table 7-12).  
Just over one third (35.0%) of children and adolescents with mental disorders had seen a general 
practitioner for their emotional and behavioural problems. However, only 4.3% had seen only a 
general practitioner and no other health service provider for their emotional and behavioural 
problems. Almost one quarter (23.9%) had seen a psychologist and 7.1% had seen a psychiatrist. 
General practitioners are the most common source of referrals to other health professionals. More 
particularly, they are responsible for the development of mental health care plans that allow access to 
Medicare-funded specialised mental health care, notably psychological services. This is reflected in 
   
 
 
 
The Mental Health of Children and Adolescents

the survey data, which shows that one fifth (20.6%) of young people had seen a general practitioner 
and either a psychologist or psychiatrist in the previous 12 months for their emotional and 
behavioural problems. In addition, 15.4% had seen a general practitioner and paediatrician. 
There were some differences between the types of health service providers seen by children and 
adolescents. A higher proportion of adolescents had seen a psychologist compared with 4-11 year-
olds (29.1% compared with 19.8%) and twice as many adolescents had seen a counsellor or family 
therapist (29.0% compared with 14.1%). They were also more likely to have seen a general 
practitioner, a psychiatrist or a social worker. While children were more likely to have seen an 
occupational therapist (10.9% for 4-11 year-olds compared with 4.2% for 12-17 year-olds) (Table 7-12). 
Similar proportions of children and adolescents with mental disorders had seen a paediatrician in the 
previous 12 months (22.5% and 19.2% respectively). However, the proportion seeing a paediatrician 
for emotional or behavioural problems out of those who had seen any health service provider was 
higher among children (48.6% for 4-11 year-olds compared with 31.6% of 12-17 year-olds).

General practitioners and paediatricians were the health service providers most likely to have been 
seen only once by children and adolescents with mental disorders for emotional and behavioural 
problems, with 41.7% having seen a general practitioner only once and 31.7% a paediatrician only 
once in the previous 12 months (Table 7-13).  
Occupational therapists, counsellors or family therapists and psychologists were seen the most 
number of times, with 31.2%, 29.5% and 24.4% respectively of young people with mental disorders 
having seen these health service providers ten times or more in the previous 12 months. In addition

almost one fifth of young people with mental disorders saw psychiatrists (19.1%) and social workers 
(19.9%) on ten or more occasions.

One in sixteen (6.2%) children and adolescents with mental disorders had attended a hospital 
emergency or outpatient department or been admitted to hospital due to their emotional or 
behavioural problems in the previous 12 months (Table 7-14). 
Specialist child and adolescent mental health services were seen by 3.3% of children and adolescents 
(5.7% of 12-17 year-olds) with mental disorders for emotional or behavioural problems in the previous 
12 months. This was restricted to those seen by a paediatrician, psychiatrist, psychologist or nurse in 
these specialist services.

headspace 
Since 2006, the Australian Government has funded headspace — Australia’s National Youth Mental 
Health Foundation, a national service for young people aged 12-25 years.  
Half (50.7%) of all parents and carers of 12-17 year-olds had heard about headspace and two thirds 
(64.6%) of those with an adolescent who had a mental disorder had heard about headspace.

Parents and carers reported that 7.3% of young people with mental disorders had visited a headspace 
centre in the previous 12 months. Another 3.4% of parents and carers whose 12-17 year-olds had a 
mental disorder didn’t know if their adolescent had visited a headspace centre. 
Data from adolescent reports of the use of headspace services are presented in Chapter 13.

Medication

Medication 
One in eight (12.8%) children and adolescents with mental disorders had taken a medication for 
emotional or behavioural problem in the previous two weeks. The proportion of adolescents taking 
medications for emotional or behavioural problems in the previous two weeks was higher than for 
children (16.7% for 12-17 year-olds compared with 9.8% for 4-11 year-olds) (Table 7-15). 
Medication use was marginally higher among those with conduct disorder and major depressive 
disorder (19.5% and 18.2% respectively for 4-17 year-olds). It was also higher among adolescents than 
children for any type of mental disorder. The greatest difference between the two age groups was for 
those with ADHD, with 21.5% of 12-17 year-olds taking medication for emotional and behavioural 
problems in the previous 12 months compared with 14.3% of 4-11 year-olds.

School service use by children and adolescents with mental disorders 
Two fifths (40.2%) of children and adolescents with mental disorders had used or attended services 
provided by their school for emotional or behavioural problems in the previous 12 months. Almost 
three in ten (28.4%) young people with mental disorders had used individual counselling services and 
almost one in ten (9.2%) had participated in group counselling or a support program (Table 7-16). 
Adolescents with mental disorders were more likely to have used or attended a service at school than 
children (48.7% for 12-17 year-olds compared with 33.5% for 4-11 year-olds). In particular, adolescents 
were twice as likely to have used individual counselling services at school (38.8% for 12-17 year-olds 
compared with 20.3% for 4-11 year-olds) and participated in group counselling or a support program 
(12.6% for 12-17 year-olds compared with 6.5% for 4-11 year-olds).

The highest level of school service use was by those with a major depressive disorder, with three fifths 
(61.9%) of 4-17 year-olds having used these services. This was followed by those with conduct 
disorder (53.8%), anxiety disorders (44.1%) and then ADHD (37.0%) (Table 7-18). 
Just over seven out of ten young people (72.6%) with severe disorders had used school services in the 
previous 12 months. This was one and a half times higher than for those with moderate disorders 
(52.5%) and about two and a half times higher than for those with mild disorders (27.2%).  
Nine out of ten (90.1%) children and adolescents with a severe conduct disorder had used school 
services in the previous 12 months. Comparisons in the use of school services among those with 
severe disorders by disorder type should be treated with caution as the differences are not statistically 
significant.

7.5  
Telephone counselling and online service use by children and 
adolescents with mental disorders  
An ever increasing range of telephone and online information, assessment tools, support and 
counselling services are available to young people to assist them with their emotional and 
behavioural problems. Given that these services can be accessed directly by young people, and 
without parental or carer permission, it is more difficult for parents or carers to know whether their 
children have used these services. Very few children under the age of 12 years had used telephone or 
online services and so results are reported for 12-17 year-olds only. 
Just 3.6% of 12-17 year-olds with mental disorders had used a telephone counselling service in the 
previous 12 months. The parents and carers of another 12.8% of 12-17 year-olds said that they didn’t 
know whether their adolescent had used these services or not. 
Parents and carers reported that 10.9% of 12-17 year-olds with mental disorders had used online 
services, including services provided by headspace, Reachout and Youth beyondblue, to get help or 
information about emotional or behavioural problems in the previous 12 months. Another 17.0% 
didn’t know whether their adolescent had used these online services.  
7.6  
Use of services by parents and carers 
Apart from young people directly receiving services for their emotional or behavioural problems, 
parents and carers (and other family members) may use a variety of services to help them manage 
their child’s or adolescent’s problems. This section describes use of health service providers and 
online services by parents and carers for this purpose.

Other than when they had taken the child to see someone, almost one third of parents and carers 
(29.5%) of children and adolescents with mental disorders reported that they or other family 
members had used services in the past 12 months to help manage their child’s or adolescent’s 
problems.  One fifth or 6.1% of these reported that they had used these services, but that their child or 
adolescent had not used any services for emotional and behavioural problems in the previous 12 
months.

Health service use 
Overall 27.3% of parents and carers of children and adolescents with mental disorders had used a 
health service in the past 12 months to help them with their child’s or adolescent’s problems. Parents 
and carers most commonly used the services of general practitioners (17.7%), psychologists (12.4%) 
and counsellors or family therapists (11.0%) to help them with their child’s or adolescent’s problems 
(Table 7-19).

Parents and carers may also have spoken to a general practitioner about their child’s or adolescent’s 
problems in the course of a consultation primarily for some other purpose. Two fifths of parents and 
carers (42.6%) had spoken to a general practitioner about their child’s problems in the previous 12 
months. Of those that had spoken to a general practitioner, nearly three quarters (73.3%) had done 
this on more than one occasion, and one fifth (20.3%) had done so five or more times. 
7.6.2  
Online service use 
7.6.2  
Online service use 
Almost two fifths (37.6%) of parents and carers of children and adolescents with mental disorders had 
used an online service in the previous 12 months for help or information about their child’s or 
adolescent’s problems (Table 7-20). 
Most of these parents and carers had used online services for information about mental health issues 
or services in the community and about half had used another type of online service such as an 
assessment tool, personal support or counselling (32.6% and 18.4% respectively).

Understanding who does and does not use services 
The majority of young people using services were assessed as having one or more of the four types of 
mental disorders (anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder, ADHD and conduct disorder), however, 
many did not. Information was collected in the survey on a number of factors that provide further 
insight into who else was using services for emotional and behavioural problems and what might 
have contributed to their service use. The other indicators of mental health problems or distress were 
as follows: 
 
A clinically sub-threshold level of mental disorder, in which symptoms are present but not at a 
level of severity and/or for a sufficient time for diagnosis of the disorder, as indicated on one 
or more of the DISC-IV diagnostic modules completed by parents and carers and/or the major 
depressive disorder module completed by 11-17 year-olds; 
 
A score in the ‘abnormal’ range on the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), 
indicating a substantial risk of clinically significant problems; 
 
A ‘very high’ level of psychological distress as indicated by the Kessler 10 Psychological 
Distress Scale; and 
 
Suicide attempt or attempts ever in their lifetime as reported by 12-17 year-olds.

Half (50.4%) of children and adolescents who had used services for emotional or behavioural 
problems in the previous 12 months were assessed on the basis of information provided by their 
parents and carers, or themselves in the case of adolescents, as having a mental disorder according to 
DSM-IV diagnostic criteria (Table 7-21). 
Another 40.0% of those using services had symptoms of a mental disorder but at a clinically sub-
threshold level based on the DISC-IV responses, an abnormal SDQ score, a Kessler 10 score indicating 
distress at a very high level and/or had ever attempted suicide. A little under one in ten (9.7%) children 
and adolescents who had used a service did not appear to have significant mental health problems 
based on any of these indicators.

Young people with mental disorders who did not use services  
Overall, 44.0% or an estimated 246,000 children and adolescents who were assessed as having a 
mental disorder had not used services in the previous 12 months. This is the equivalent of 5.9% of all 
4-17 year-olds. 
Four fifths (79.9%) of children and adolescents aged 4-17 years with a mental disorder who did not 
use services had mild disorders, however, 15.9% had moderate disorders and 4.2% had severe 
disorders. Four fifths (81.9%) of 4-17 year-olds with a mental disorder who did not use services had 
one type of mental disorder, 15.4% had two disorders and 2.7% had three disorders.  
Children with mental disorders were less likely to have used services than adolescents. Two thirds 
(65.2%) of those with mental disorders who had not used services were aged 4-11 years and one third 
(34.8%) were aged 12-17 years. 
Of those 4-17 year-olds who had a mental disorder in the past 12 months and who did not use 
services in that period, almost three in ten (28.5%) had used a service for emotional or behavioural 
problems at some point prior to the 12-month period covered by the survey. However, the remaining 
71.5% had never used any service for emotional or behavioural problems. This corresponds to 30.2% 
of all 4-17 year-olds with a mental disorder. 
Chapter 8 reports on parents and carers perception of their children’s and adolescents’ needs for 
services and provides important insights as to why many of these young people did not use services.

PERCEIVED NEED AND BARRIERS TO RECEIVING 
MENTAL HEALTH CARE 
There are several factors that determine whether young people receive services for their emotional 
and behavioural problems. Firstly, the young person or their parents and carers or another significant 
person in their lives must recognise that there is a problem and that the problem requires assistance. 
Secondly, they or people close to them need to know that there are effective services to deal with 
these problems and these must be accessible. Lastly, parents and carers, and young people 
themselves particularly when they are older, must feel able to receive care and be willing to use 
services.  
This chapter reports on the need for services and barriers to care for young people as perceived by 
their parents and carers. 
8.1  
Perceived need for mental health care 
Parents and carers were asked about the help their child or adolescent needed with their emotional 
or behavioural problems and whether their needs for these had been met. The help was categorised 
into four types:  
• 
Information about emotional or behavioural problems, treatment and available services; 
• 
Prescribed medication for emotional or behavioural problems;  
• 
Counselling or a talking therapy about problems or difficulties (either one-on-one, as a family 
or in a group); and 
• 
Courses or other counselling for life skills, self-esteem or motivation.

Perceived need for help
help for all children and adolescents
for all children and adolescents 
Just over a quarter (26.8%) of all parents and carers reported that in the previous 12 months their 
child or adolescent had some need for help for emotional or behavioural problems. Seven out of ten 
parents and carers (70.2%) who indicated a need for help reported their child’s or adolescent’s needs 
were met either fully (42.9%) or partially (27.3%). The remainder (29.8%) indicated their needs were 
not met at all (Table 8-1).  
The most common type of help parents and carers felt their children needed was counselling or a 
talking therapy, with one fifth of all parents (21.6%) reporting a need for such services in the previous 
12 months. Of the 4-17 year-olds whose parents indicated a need for counselling or talking therapy, 
two thirds (66.8%) reported that their needs were met either fully (42.7%) or partially (24.1%).  
One in ten parents and carers of 4-17 year-olds (10.3%) indicated a need for courses or other 
counselling for life skills, self-esteem or motivation in the previous 12 months, of which less than half 
(43.1%) indicated the need was met either fully (29.0%) or partially (14.1%). Similarly, about one in ten 
(12.1%) parents and carers identified a need for information, of which 62.4% reported that the need 
was met either fully (44.3%) or partially (18.1%). Relatively few (4.2%) parents and carers identified a 
need for medication.

Perceived need for help for young people with mental disorder
Perceived need for help for young people with mental disorders 
Almost four fifths (78.6%) of parents and carers of children and adolescents with mental disorders 
identified that their children had a need for some type of help with their emotional and behavioural 
problems in the previous 12 months.  Almost three quarters (73.8%) of these parents and carers 
reported that their children’s need for help in the previous 12 months had been either fully (34.9%) or 
partially met (38.9%).  However, one quarter (26.2%) reported that they had unmet need (Table 8-2).  
Almost double the proportion of parents and carers of 4-11 year-olds with mental disorders than of 
12-17 year-olds with mental disorders felt that their children had no need for help (26.8% compared 
to 14.6%).

Counselling was the type of help most often reported as needed. Two thirds (68.1%) of parents and 
carers of children and adolescents with mental disorders reported that their child or adolescent 
needed counselling. Of these, just over two thirds (67.7%) indicated that their needs were met either 
fully (36.8%) or partially (30.9%) (Table 8-3). 
Two fifths of parents and carers (41.7%) of children and adolescents with mental disorders reported a 
need for information, and this need was met fully (39.4%) or partially (25.0%) in about two thirds of 
cases. Just over one fifth (22.3%) of parents and carers reported  a need for medication for their child 
or adolescent in the previous 12 months and this need was met in 76.5% of cases, either fully (54.5%) 
or partially (22.0%).

One third (36.0%) of parents and carers of children and adolescents with mental disorders reported 
that the young person needed life skills training.  A relatively low proportion (39.1%) reported that this 
need was met either fully (20.6%) or partially (18.5%).  The majority (60.9%) of parents reporting a 
need for life skills training indicated the need was not met.

The extent to which parents perceived a need for help varied with the severity of the young person’s 
disorder (Table 8-4).  Two thirds (68.3%) of parents and carers of 4-17 year-olds with mild mental 
disorders felt that their child or adolescent needed help, and in 65.6% of cases these needs were met 
either fully (40.2%) or partially (25.4%). By contrast, all or nearly all parents of children or adolescents 
with a moderate or severe mental disorder (91.8% and 100.0% respectively) reported that they 
needed some form of help.  A higher proportion of parents of children and adolescents with moderate 
and severe disorders (81.8% and 84.2% respectively) reported that their needs were met fully or 
partially than did those parents of 4-17 year-olds with mild mental disorders (65.6%). 
Parents and carers of three quarters (73.6%) of those with severe disorders, one half (51.6%) of those 
with moderate disorders and less than one third (29.6%) of those with mild disorders identified a need 
for information. The need for information was unmet in about one third of cases (34.6% in those with 
severe disorders, 31.5% for moderate disorders, and 39.1% for mild disorders). 
Parents and carers reported that half (52.4%) of children and adolescents with severe disorders, one 
third (36.7%) of those with moderate disorders and less than one in ten (8.7%) of those with mild 
disorders had a need for prescribed medication. This need was unmet for around one quarter of those 
with severe disorders (23.3%) and moderate disorders (28.4%). 
Counselling or talking therapies were the type of help most often reported by parents and carers as 
being needed, with 87.0% of those with severe disorders, 85.8% of those with moderate disorders and 
55.9% of those with mild disorders identifying a need for this type of help. According to parents and 
carers, four fifths (84.9%) of children and adolescents with severe disorders needing counselling had 
their needs met either fully (30.9%) or partially (54.0%) with the remainder (15.1%) reporting their 
needs were unmet.  Unlike other types of help, unmet need for counselling was strongly associated 
with severity, increasing for those with moderate disorders and again for those with mild disorders 
(28.7% and 41.3% respectively). 
 84 
The Mental Health of Children and Adolescents 
Two thirds (66.0%) of parents and carers of children and adolescents with severe disorders identified 
a need for courses or other counselling for life skills, self-esteem or motivation as did 38.3% of those 
with moderate disorders and 27.6% of those with mild disorders. Need for courses or other 
counselling for life skills, self-esteem or motivation was unmet in three fifths of cases with 58.5% of 
those with severe disorders, 64.9% of those with moderate disorders and 60.0% of those with mild 
disorders having unmet need.

As reported in Chapter 7, just over half (56.0%) of children and adolescents with mental disorders had 
used services for emotional and behavioural problems in the previous 12 months. Conversely, 44.0% 
had not used any services. 
Virtually all (97.1%) parents and carers of children and adolescents with mental disorders who had 
used services in the previous 12 months reported that their child or adolescent had a need for some 
type of help (Table 8-5). Of these, only a small proportion (6.2%) reported that these needs were 
unmet.  In terms of the particular types of help needed by those who had used services in the previous 
12 months, the greatest area of need reported by parents was for counselling (87.0%).

8.2  
Barriers to seeking and receiving help  
Table 8-6 shows all the reasons given by parents and carers of children and adolescents with mental 
disorders for not seeking help or receiving more help when needs were not fully met. The most 
commonly identified reasons were not being sure where to get help (39.6%), not being able to afford 
help (37.0%) and preferring to handle the problem by themselves or with help from family or friends 
(31.1%). Being concerned with what other people might think was identified as a barrier by only 5.3% 
of parents and carers.

25.4 
 
Some reasons for not seeking help or receiving more help were more common among children than 
adolescents with mental disorders (Table 8-6). These included parents and carers preferring to handle 
the problem by themselves or with the help of family or friends (36.5% for 4-11 year-olds compared 
with 24.5% for 12-17 year-olds), and not being sure if help was needed (33.5% for 4-11 year-olds 
compared with 19.8% for 12-17 year-olds). In comparison, the most commonly identified reasons for 
not seeking help or receiving more help for 12-17 year-olds were related to the adolescent 
themselves, including the young person refusing help, not turning up for an appointment or thinking 
that they did not have a problem (48.4% compared with 6.2% of 4-11 year-olds). 
If parents and carers reported more than one reason, they were also asked about the main reason 
for not seeking help or receiving more help. About one third (30.9%) of parents and carers identified 
issues to do with the accessibility of services, specifically problems in getting to a service, not being 
able to afford it, or not being able to get an appointment. For about another third of parents and 
carers (36.4%), the most common main reasons for not seeking help or not receiving more help 
were being unsure if their child or adolescent needed help, where to get help, or thinking the 
problem would get better by itself, issues that could be broadly considered as mental health 
literacy (Table 8-7). 
Just under one fifth (17.3%) reported that the main reason was related to the child or adolescent not 
wanting to seek help, and 15.4% of parents and carers reported that the main reason was related to 
them wanting to manage the problems themselves.  
The main barriers to seeking help or receiving more help differed between the age groups. The 
reasons most commonly identified as the main barriers for 4-11 year-olds were issues primarily 
related to mental health literacy (43.6%) or accessibility (36.2%).  In contrast, the main barrier to 
adolescents seeking help or receiving more help was identified by about one third (34.8%) of parents 
as the young person refusing help, not turning up for appointments or because they did not think they 
had a problem.

8.3  
Perceived need for help for parents and carers of children and 
adolescents with mental disorders 
Parents and carers of children and adolescents with emotional and behavioural problems were also 
asked about whether they themselves or another family member had received any help to deal with 
their children’s problems, whether their own needs had been met and, if not, what types of help they 
felt that they needed. Two fifths (39.0%) of parents and carers reported that they had no need for any 
type of help (Table 8-8). 
Of those who reported a need for any type of help (61.0%), four fifths (78.1%) indicated their needs 
were met either fully (37.3%) or in part (40.8%) (Table 8-9). Conversely, around one fifth (21.9%) 
reported unmet need. 
The type of help for which there was greatest need was counselling, not only on how to manage the 
child's problems, but also to help family relationships and to deal with parents’ and carers’ own 
problems, worries or stresses as a result of their child’s problems. Counselling was identified by 86.5% 
of parents and carer’s who indicated some need for help.  While this need was either fully or partially 
met for nearly two thirds of parents and carers (64.4%), 45.6% of parents and carers reported their 
needs for counselling on how to manage their children’s problems were not being met at all, 44.8% 
had unmet need for counselling to help family relationships, and 38.7% had unmet need for 
counselling for their own problems, worries or stresses as a result of their child’s problems.  
In terms of information about their child’s problems, treatments and services, 41.0% had any need of 
which one third (32.6%) had unmet need. About one fifth (18.4%) of parents and carers reported some 
need for a parenting skills course of which over half (52.4%) did not have these needs met.

THE ROLE OF SCHOOLS AND IMPACT ON EDUCATION  
Schools and other educational institutions play a significant role in providing services to young 
people with mental disorders and are sometimes where emotional and behavioural problems are first 
identified.  
This chapter provides an overview of the role played by teachers and other school staff in providing 
support and other services, and referring young people with emotional and behavioural problems to 
health service providers. The relationship between mental disorders and school attendance, 
functioning at school and academic performance is also reported.  
Data are presented for the 95.9% of young people participating in the survey who were either 
attending school or another educational institution or had attended in the past 12 months and are 
based on parent and carer reports. This includes children who were attending part-time or full-time 
schooling prior to Year 1. 
9.1  
Identification of young people with emotional or behavioural problems 
by school staff 
Where parents had acknowledged that their child or adolescent had ever experienced emotional or 
behavioural problems that were significant enough to need help, they were asked who it was that 
thought that their child needed help including school staff. 
Two fifths (40.5%) of parents and carers reported that a school staff member was among those to 
suggest that their child may need help for emotional or behavioural problems. Just over a third 
(35.6%) of parents and carers reported that a school teacher or principal was among those to suggest 
that their child needed some help for emotional or behavioural problems and 12.0% said that either 
the school counsellor, psychologist or nurse were among those to identify emotional or behavioural 
problems in their child or adolescent (Table 9-1).

 School contact with families 
One eighth (12.8%) of parents and carers had been contacted in the previous 12 months by the school 
about a range of emotional or behavioural issues, including bullying (both as perpetrator or victim), 
aggressive behaviour and conduct issues (Table 9-2).  
 90 
The Mental Health of Children and Adolescents 
It was more common that schools contacted families about emotional or behavioural issues when the 
student was male (16.2%) rather than female (9.3%). It was also more common that families were 
contacted by the school about emotional or behavioural issues when students were older (15.4% of 
12-17 year-olds compared with 10.8% of 4-11 year-olds). 
Contact by the school in respect of emotional or behavioural issues was over four times more 
common for those students who were identified in the survey as having mental disorders (39.7% 
compared to 8.3% of students without a disorder). The proportion contacted was higher for older 
students (45.3%) with a mental disorder than younger students with mental disorders (35.4%). The 
proportion was also higher for males with mental disorders (43.4%), than for females with mental 
disorders (34.3%) especially in the 4-11 year-olds age group (40.2% of males compared with 27.6% of 
females).

Services used at school 
Just over one in ten (11.5%) students had used a school service for emotional or behavioural 
problems in the previous 12 months, with a higher proportion of older students (14.2% of 12-17 year-
olds) than younger students (9.4% of 4-11 year-olds) using services (Table 9-3). 
Individual counselling was the most commonly used type of school service in the previous 12 months 
(8.0% of students). Twice as many older students (11.0%) as younger students (5.6%) used individual 
counselling services at school.

Referral from school to health service providers  
When parents and carers reported that the child or adolescent had used the services of particular 
health service providers in the previous 12 months for emotional or behavioural problems, they were 
asked if the recommendation or advice to see the provider came from the school.  
Of those children or adolescents who had seen a paediatrician, one quarter (25.3%) had been 
recommended or advised to see the paediatrician by their school. About one in six children and 
adolescents who used the services of a general practitioner, psychiatrist or psychologist in the 
previous 12 months (15.8%, 17.0% and 16.9% respectively) had seen the health service provider 
following recommendation or advice from the school (Table 9-4).

Informal support from teachers and other school staff 
One in five students (18.9%) had received informal support for emotional or behavioural problems 
from a school staff member in the previous 12 months. Of those that had received informal support 
from school staff nearly three fifths (57.2%) had not used formal school services in the previous 12 
months as reported in the previous section. One in six students (15.7%) had received informal support 
from their teachers and one eighth (12.2%) had received informal support for emotional or 
behavioural problems from other school staff (Table 9-5).  
 92 
The Mental Health of Children and Adolescents 
Informal support was around four times higher for young people with a mental disorder, with around 
half of students with a mental disorder (51.0%) receiving informal support from their teacher and/or 
other school staff in the previous 12 months compared with 13.6% of those without a mental disorder.

Relationship between mental disorders and schooling 
This section reports on the relationship between mental disorders and school-related outcomes, 
including days absent from school, impact on functioning at school due to symptoms of mental 
disorder, school performance in different learning areas and enjoyment of school.  
9.5.1  
Days absent from school 
9.5.1  
Days absent from school 
The average days absent from school due to symptoms of the mental disorder were greatest for those 
with major depressive disorder and anxiety disorders (on average 20 and 12 days in the previous 12 
months respectively). The days absent were far higher among older students for all disorders, with 12-
17 year-olds with major depressive disorder being absent 23 days and those with anxiety disorders 
absent 20 days on average in the previous 12 months. Although adolescents with conduct disorder 
did not have as many days absent from school, the difference between the two age groups was 
greatest, with 12-17 year-olds absent 17 days and 4-11 year olds absent just 2 days on average in the 
previous 12 months due to the symptoms of their disorder (Table 9-6).

9.5.2  
Impact on functioning at school 
The level of impact on functioning at school varied with the type of mental disorder. The greatest 
impact was due to symptoms of major depressive disorder, with this having had a severe impact on 
school function for one third (34.3%) of students with this disorder. The symptoms of ADHD had the 
least impact for most students, with this having mild impact on schooling for 40.0% of students. One 
third (35.6%) of those with conduct disorder and 20.0% with anxiety disorders experienced no impact 
on schooling according to parents and carers (Table 9-7).

The level of impact on schooling differed between the age groups for all types of mental disorders. In 
particular, severe impact on functioning at school due to symptoms of anxiety or ADHD was more 
common among 12-17 year-old students than 4-11 year-old students (29.1% compared with 12.6% for 
anxiety disorders and 20.4% compared with 8.5% for ADHD). The greatest difference was for conduct 
disorders, with the impact being severe for 22.8% of 12-17 year olds and moderate for another 43.6% 
compared with 10.3% with severe impact and 11.0% with moderate impact for 4-11 year-olds.

School performance by mental disorder status 
9.5.3  
School performance by mental disorder status 
Table 9-8 shows parent and carer ratings of students’ performance across five different learning areas 
for those with and without a mental disorder. Given the different ages at which learning areas are 
introduced, performance in Maths, English, Art and Sports is reported for children aged six and older, 
and performance in Science is reported for children aged 11 and over. 
School performance in all subjects was markedly poorer for those with a mental disorder. In particular 
there was a greater difference in the core learning areas. In Maths 37.0% of students with mental 
disorders were rated below average compared with 10.5% of those with no disorder. In English 39.4% 
of students with mental disorders were rated below average compared with 10.8% of those with no 
disorder. In Science 33.7% of students with mental disorders were rated below average compared 
with 8.8% of those with no disorder. The same was true for Art and Sports learning areas, but the 
differences were somewhat less.

The survey also gathered data from parents and carers concerning how much their children liked 
school. A higher proportion of children and adolescents with a mental disorder than those without 
a mental disorder somewhat disliked or very much disliked school (21.6% compared with 5.1%) 
(Table 9-9).

What adolescents 
told us 
 
Mental health problems, self-harm, suicidal 
behaviours and risk behaviours based on 
adolescents’
 self-reported information 
 
 
Adolescents aged 11-17 years were asked to complete a self-report 
questionnaire on a tablet computer in the privacy of their own bedrooms. 
The questionnaire had 12 modules, took 37 minutes on average to 
complete, and was completed by 89% of the selected young people. 
The questionnaire included the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children 
Version IV (DISC-IV) major depressive disorder module, as well as 
questions on services used for emotional or behavioural problems. 
Additional modules were included about young people’s experiences at 
school, family relationships, self-esteem, protective factors and a range 
of risk behaviours as well as any self-harm and suicidality.  Age cut-offs 
were implemented for certain questions that were considered 
inappropriate to ask younger adolescents. 
All young people also completed the Kessler 10 Psychological Distress 
Scale, a measure of psychological distress and the Strengths and 
Difficulties Questionnaire, a brief behavioural screening questionnaire. 
Comparison of responses with those from parents and carers highlights 
the importance of collecting information from young people themselves.

10 MENTAL DISORDERS, SELF-REPORTED PROBLEMS 
AND DISTRESS 
The survey collected information about major depressive disorder in children and adolescents aged 
4-17 years from parents and carers (see Chapter 3) and also from young people themselves aged 11-
17 years. The tool used for assessing major depressive disorder was the major depressive disorder 
module from the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children Version IV (DISC-IV). This was included in 
the adolescent self-report questionnaire for 11-17 year-olds, and the parent report version was given 
to parents and carers. The information provided was used to determine whether a young person met 
the diagnostic criteria for the disorder as described in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental 
Disorders Version IV (DSM-IV). 
This chapter presents the prevalence of major depressive disorder determined on the basis of 
adolescents’ responses to the DISC-IV module. Differences in the prevalence from the perspectives of 
young people and parents and carers are also examined. 
Further insight into young people’s mental health is provided by the Kessler 10 Psychological Distress 
Scale (K10) and the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), which were also completed as part 
of the adolescent self-report questionnaire. 
10.1 Prevalence of major depressive disorder 
Based on information from young people themselves, 7.7% of adolescents aged 11-17 years met the 
diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder. This is equivalent to an estimated 152,000 
adolescents with major depressive disorder.  
The prevalence of major depressive disorder was higher in females than males (11.0% compared with 
4.5%), and higher in older adolescents (16-17 years) than younger adolescents (11-15 years). Some 
8.2% of males aged 16-17 years met diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder, compared with 
3.1% of males aged 11-15 years. In females, 19.6% of 16-17 year-olds had major depressive disorder 
compared with 7.2% of 11-15 year-olds (Table 10-1).

10.2 Severity of impact on functioning of major depressive disorder 
The severity of major depressive disorder in four different domains (school or work, friends and social 
activities, family and self) and overall was assessed from young people directly using the same set of 
 98 
The Mental Health of Children and Adolescents 
questions that was administered to their parents and carers. Based on information from young 
people themselves, one in three young people with major depressive disorder (34.2%) had severe 
impact on functioning. Similar proportions of young people with major depressive disorder 
experienced a severe level of impact in each of the four domains considered (Table 10-2).

10.3 Comparison of prevalence of major depressive disorder based on 
adolescent report with parent and carer report 
The prevalence of major depressive disorder based on information provided by adolescents and that 
based on information provided by parents and carers are presented in Table 10-3. Overall, the 
prevalence of major depressive disorder was higher based on adolescent reported information (7.7% 
of 11-17 year-olds) compared with parent or carer reported information (4.7% of 11-17 year-olds). 
However, the prevalence is considerably higher when considered together (i.e. when either source is 
used as the basis for classification), with one in ten young people (10.5% of adolescents aged 11-17 
years) meeting the diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder based on information provided by 
either or both the young person and his or her parent or carer. 
The prevalence of major depressive disorder was higher in females than in males and the difference 
was greater when the prevalence was based on adolescent report (11.0% for females and 4.5% for 
males compared with 5.7% for females and 3.7% for males when based on parent and carer report).

Young people rated how much their parents or carers knew about how they were feeling. Among 
adolescents who did not have major depressive disorder based on either their own or their parent’s 
and carer’s reports, 7.4% said their parents or carers know ‘not at all’ how they are feeling, compared 
with 14.9% of young people where both the adolescent report and parent or carer report indicate the 
young person had major depressive disorder, and 29.5% where only the adolescent report indicated 
the young person has major depressive disorder. Among adolescents without major depressive 
disorder 40.2% said their parents or carers knew a lot about how they were feeling compared with 
14.3% of adolescents with major depressive disorder identified based on the adolescent report only. 
Two thirds of young people with major depressive disorder based on information in their self-report 
said that their parents or carers only knew ‘a little’ or ‘not at all’ about their feelings (37.6% and 29.5% 
respectively). Where parents and carers had also provided information on which to base a diagnosis 
of major depressive disorder, just over half of young people reported that their parents or carers had 
poor knowledge about how they were feeling (40.3% ‘a little’ and 14.9% ‘not at all’). In contrast three 
quarters (75.7%) of young people without major depressive disorder reported that their parents or 
carers knew ‘a lot’ or ‘some’ about how they were feeling (Table 10-4).

10.4 Psychological distress 
The Kessler 10 Psychological Distress Scale (K10) is a measure of psychological distress that has been 
shown to be highly correlated with the presence of depressive or anxiety disorders. Scores are 
classified into four levels of psychological distress — low, moderate, high and very high distress. 
One fifth of adolescents aged 11-17 years had very high or high levels of psychological distress (6.6% 
and 13.3% respectively). The proportion was higher for females than males (9.5% and 16.4% 
compared with 4.0% and 10.4%). A higher proportion of older adolescents had very high and high 
levels of psychological distress (11.0% and 16.2% of 16-17 year-olds compared with 4.8% and 12.2% of 
11-15 year-olds) (Table 10-5).

Four fifths of young people who were identified as having major depressive disorder from 
information that they provided alone also had very high and high levels of psychological distress 
(45.2% and 35.5% respectively). The proportion was slightly higher for young people with major 
depressive disorder identified from both parent or carer and adolescent reported information, with 
just over half (55.2%) being very highly distressed and another 36.0% highly distressed. The level of 
distress was not as strongly associated with major depressive disorder status based on parent or

10.5 Strengths and difficulties questionnaire 
The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) is a brief behavioural screening questionnaire 
comprising five subscales of five items each. Items in four of these subscales, that is emotional 
problems, conduct problems, hyperactivity and peer problems, are combined to generate a total 
difficulties score. Scores in the ‘abnormal’ range indicate substantial risk of clinically significant 
problems. The SDQ was designed so that approximately 10% of children and adolescents will fall into 
the ‘abnormal’ range on the total difficulties score. 
One tenth (10.2%) of young people aged 11-17 years scored in the abnormal range on the SDQ total 
difficulties scale. The proportion was higher in females than males (12.1% compared with 8.3%), and 
higher in older adolescents than younger adolescents (12.4% in 16-17 year-olds compared with 9.2% 
in 11-15 year-olds) (Table 10-7).

The proportion of young people with abnormal scores was highest on the hyperactivity scale followed 
by the emotional problems scale (13.8% and 10.9% respectively). Emotional problems were more 
prevalent in females than males (16.3% compared with 5.8%), while conduct problems were more 
common in males than females (10.0% compared with 7.5%). Emotional problems were more 
common in older adolescents compared with younger adolescents (16.0% in 16-17 year-olds 
compared with 8.8% in 11-15 year-olds) (Table 10-8).

The SDQ also includes an impact scale that measures interference in life due to emotional and 
behavioural problems in the domains of home life, friendships, classroom learning and leisure 
activities. Overall 19.2% of young people aged 11-17 years were in the abnormal range on the SDQ 
impact scale. More females than males were in the abnormal range on the SDQ impact scale (22.3% 
compared with 16.3%) and more older adolescents were in the abnormal range than younger 
adolescents (24.4% in 16-17 year-olds compared with 17.1% in 11-15 year-olds).

11 ADOLESCENT REPORTED SELF-HARM AND SUICIDAL 
BEHAVIOURS 
Self-harm refers to deliberately hurting or injuring yourself without trying to end your life. Suicidal 
behaviours refer to suicidal ideation (serious thoughts about taking one’s own life), making suicide 
plans and suicide attempts where the self-injury is intended to end in death. 
This chapter describes results obtained from the adolescent self-report questionnaire about the 
prevalence of self-harm and suicidal behaviours and the association between these behaviours and 
mental disorders. These questions were only asked of young people aged 12 years and over. 
11.1 Self-harm 
Around one in ten adolescents (10.9%) reported having ever self-harmed. This is equivalent to 186,000 
young people aged 12-17 years who had deliberately injured themselves. About three quarters of 
these adolescents (amounting to 8.0% of the full population or an estimated 137,000 young people) 
harmed themselves in the previous 12 months (Table 11-1). In addition, 7.5% of 12-17 year-olds 
answered “prefer not to say” to the first question on self-harm and were not asked subsequent 
questions. As such the proportion of young people who have ever self-harmed may be higher than 
indicated in these estimates. 
Self-harm was more common among females than among males and more common in older 
adolescents, with 16.8% of females aged 16-17 years having self-harmed in the previous 12 months 
and 22.8% having ever self-harmed. The prevalence among 12-15 year-old females was lower, but still 
higher than for males, with 9.8% of females aged 12-15 years having self-harmed in the previous 12 
months and 11.1% having ever self-harmed. In comparison 9.1% of males aged 16-17 years and 5.7% 
of males aged 12-15 years had ever self-harmed with 6.2% of 16-17 year-old males and 3.0% of 12-15 
year-old males having self-harmed in the previous 12 months. 
Over half of females who had ever self-harmed had self-harmed four or more times (amounting to 
6.0% of females aged 12-15 years and 14.9% of females aged 16-17 years). The proportion of males 
who had self-harmed four or more times were much lower (1.9% of males aged 12-15 years and 4.5% 
of males aged 16-17 years). One in ten of the young people aged 12-17 years who had self-harmed in 
the previous 12 months or 0.8% overall had received medical treatment as a direct result of injuries 
incurred by an act of deliberate self-harm. 
Of those adolescents that had self-harmed in the previous 12 months, 61.6% had self-harmed more 
than four times at any time in the past. 
Rates of self-harm by selected socio-demographic characteristics (family type, household income, 
carer education, carer labour force status and area of residence) are shown in supplementary tables 
S-52 through S-56. In young people who did not have major depressive disorder based on adolescent 
self-report, self-harm rates were higher in young people from step families compared with original 
families. Of young people without major depressive disorder, 14.7% had ever self-harmed and 7.8% 
had self-harmed 4 or more times from step families compared with 6.4% and 2.5% respectively from 
 104 The Mental Health of Children and Adolescents 
original families. There were no significant differences in self-harm rates by other socio-demographic 
characteristics.

11.1.1 Self-harm and mental disorder 
11.1.1 Self-harm and mental disorder 
The highest rate of self-harm was in adolescents with major depressive disorder. This was particularly 
so for females with major depressive disorder, approximately half of whom had self-harmed (54.9% 
and 49.2% of those with major depressive disorder based on adolescent and parent reports 
respectively). While young people with other mental disorders had rates of self-harm more than twice 
as high as those with no disorder, the rates for these young people were markedly lower than for 
young people with major depressive disorder (32.5% for all 12-17 year-olds with major depressive 
disorder, 10.6% for those with other disorders and 4.2% for those with no disorder based on parent 
reports) (Table 11-2).  
Receiving medical treatment as the direct result of injuries incurred in an act of deliberate self-harm 
was also markedly higher for young people with major depressive disorder compared to those with no 
disorder (6.6% when based on self-report or 9.9% when based on parent report compared with 0.8% 
for all persons). 
One in twelve (8.5%) females who had major depressive disorder based on their self-reports received 
medical treatment in the previous 12 months. However, the rate for females with major depressive 
disorder was double this (16.9%) when their disorder status was based on parent or carer reports.

11.1.2 Self-harm and service use 
11.1.2 Self-harm and service use 
More than half (57.6%) of adolescents who had self harmed more than four times at any time in the 
past had used services for emotional or behavioural problems in the previous 12 months (Table 11-3). 
Most commonly these adolescents had used a health service (53.5%) or school service (48.8%) while 
fewer had used telephone counselling (15.4%) or online personal support or counselling services such 
as those provided by headspace, Reachout, and Youth beyondblue (7.4%).  
Rates of service use among 13-17 year-olds who had self-harmed in the previous 12 months were 
similar to rates of service use among those who had ever self-harmed more than four times. Service 
use among those who had self-harmed in the previous 12 months was higher among females than 
males (60.9% compared with 40.1%). 
It is not possible to say from the survey whether the services were used before or after the time that 
the person had harmed themselves.

service. 
11.2 Suicidal behaviours 
Around 128,000 or 7.5% of young people aged 12-17 years had seriously considered attempting 
suicide in the previous 12 months. The proportion was over twice as high for females as for males 
(10.7% and 4.5% respectively). In addition, 4.7% of males and 6.6% of females answered “prefer not to 
say” to the question on suicidal ideation and were not asked subsequent questions about suicide 
plans or suicide attempts. As such, the results presented here may underestimate the full extent of 
suicidal behaviours in Australian young people. 
Overall one third of young people who had seriously considered attempting suicide in the previous 12 
months, or 2.4% of all 12-17 year-olds, reported having attempted suicide in the previous 12 months. 
This is equivalent to 41,000 young people. One quarter or 0.6% of all 12-17 year-olds received medical 
treatment as a direct result of their injuries (Table 11-4).  
Suicide attempts were more common among females than among males and for 16-17 year-olds 
compared with younger adolescents (4.7% for females and 2.9% for males aged 16-17 years 
compared with 2.7% for females and 0.8% for males aged 12-15 years in the previous 12 months). 
Rates of suicidal behaviours by selected socio-demographic characteristics (family type, household 
income, carer education, carer labour force status and area of residence) are shown in supplementary 
tables S-58 through S-62. There were no significant differences in rates of suicidal behaviours by 
socio-demographic characteristics.

11.2.1 Suicidal behaviours and mental disorder 
11.2.1 Suicidal behaviours and mental disorder 
Suicidal behaviours were strongly associated with mental disorder, in particular major depressive 
disorder. Rates of suicidal ideation, suicide plans and suicide attempts were much lower in young 
people whose parents or carers had identified any other mental illness apart from major depressive 
disorder than in those young people where major depressive disorder was identified. In addition 
these rates were higher when the major depressive disorder was based on information provided by 
the young person themselves than when based on information provided by the parent or carer. 
Among young males identified with major depressive disorder based on adolescent self-report 
information, nearly one third (29.2%) had seriously considered suicide and 13.8% had attempted 
suicide in the previous 12 months, compared with 3.1% and 0.4% of young males without a mental 
disorder based on either the parent or adolescent report. Similarly for females, over half (56.4%) of 
those who were identified with major depressive disorder based on adolescent self-report 
information had seriously considered suicide, and over one fifth (22.1%) had attempted suicide while 
3.5% of females with no identified mental disorder had seriously considered suicide and the number 
of females with no identified mental disorder who had attempted suicide was too small to allow an 
estimate to be produced (Table 11-5). 
The highest rates of suicidal behaviours were in young people with major depressive disorder. This 
was particularly so for adolescent females. Approximately half of females with major depressive 
disorder based on self-report (56.4% or 47.7% based on parent or carer report) had seriously 
considered attempting suicide in the previous 12 months compared with just under one third (29.2%) 
of males with major depressive disorder based on self-report (or 17.0% based on parent or carer 
report). These rates were four to five times higher than for young people with other disorders based 
 108 The Mental Health of Children and Adolescents 
on their parents’ or carers’ reports and around ten times the rates for young people with no disorder 
(Table 11-5).  
Suicide plans followed a similar pattern, with 45.3% of young females and 26.0% of young males with 
major depressive disorder based on self-report having made a suicide plan in the previous 12 months 
compared with 15.1% of females and 3.5% of males with another disorder and 1.9% of females and 
1.6% of males with no disorder. 
Just over one in eight young males with major depressive disorder (13.8% when based on their self-
report or 12.2% based on parent report) attempted suicide in the previous 12 months. One quarter of 
these (3.4% of males with major depressive disorder based on self-report) received medical treatment 
as a direct result of their injuries. The rate of suicide attempts was much higher for females with major 
depressive disorder. Just over one in five (22.1% when major depressive disorder based on self-report 
or 22.7% based on parent report) attempted suicide in the previous 12 months and around one third 
of these (6.8% of females with major depressive disorder based on self-report) had received medical 
treatment as a direct result of their injuries. By comparison just 0.4% of young people with no disorder 
had attempted suicide in the previous year.

The DSM-IV criteria for major depressive disorder require a minimum of five symptoms of depression 
to be present in the same period. One of the symptoms is “recurrent thoughts of death (not just fear of 
dying), recurrent suicidal ideation without a specific plan, or a suicide attempt or a specific plan for 
   
 
 
 
The Mental Health of Children and Adolescents 109 
 
 
committing suicide”. As such, suicidal behaviours contribute towards establishing the diagnosis of 
major depressive disorder. 
11.2.2 Suicidal behaviours and service use 
11.2.2 Suicidal behaviours and service use 
Seven in ten (70.9%) 13-17 year-olds who reported a suicide attempt in the previous 12 months had 
used services for emotional or behavioural problems in the previous 12 months (Table 11-6). Most of 
these had used health services (69.8%). Over half of 13-17 year-olds who reported a suicide attempt in 
the previous 12 months had used school services (57.9%), one fifth had used a telephone counselling 
service (21.9%) and one tenth (10.9%) had used an online personal support or counselling service 
such as those provided by headspace, Reachout, and Youth beyondblue. The proportion that had 
used services was higher for females than males (77.9% and 50.6% respectively). 
Around six in ten adolescents who had seriously considered attempting suicide or had made a suicide 
plan in the previous 12 months had used services in the previous 12 months (56.6% and 59.2% 
respectively). 
It is not possible to say from the survey whether the services were used before or after the time of the 
young person seriously considering suicide, making a plan or making a suicide attempt.

12 SELF-REPORTED PROBLEMS, BEHAVIOURS AND RISK 
FACTORS IN YOUNG PEOPLE 
This chapter describes what young people reported about their mental health problems and 
behaviours that are generally considered to put them at risk. While all young people aged 11 years or 
older were asked to complete a self-report questionnaire, questions about smoking, alcohol and 
other drugs and about sexual behaviours were only asked of young people aged 13 years and older. 
12.1 Smoking 
Overall one tenth (9.9%) of young people aged 13-17 years had smoked at least once a week at some 
point in their lives and 7.2% had smoked in the last 30 days. Rates of smoking were higher in young 
people with major depressive disorder and in young people with other mental disorders compared 
with young people with no mental disorder. Some 29.9% of young people with major depressive 
disorder identified from adolescent report had ever smoked and 24.4% had smoked in the last 30 
days. These rates compared with 29.6% ever smoked and 24.1% smoked in the past 30 days among 
young people with other mental disorders based on parent or carer report. The corresponding rates 
were 5.9% ever smoked and 4.1% smoked in the last 30 days among young people with no mental 
disorder (Table 12-1).

12.2 Alcohol 
Almost two in five (37.9%) young people 13-17 years had ever drunk alcohol, 18.1% had drunk alcohol 
in the past 30 days and 12.5% had drunk more than 4 drinks in a row in the last 30 days. Rates were 
essentially the same in males and females (Table 12-2).  
Young people with major depressive disorder had higher rates of drinking alcohol. Some two thirds 
(65.3%) of young people with major depressive disorder based on adolescent report had ever drunk 
alcohol compared with one third (33.8%) of young people with no mental disorder. Some 34.3% of 
young people with major depressive disorder based on adolescent report had drunk alcohol in the 
last 30 days compared with half as many (15.4%) young people with no mental disorder, and 
approximately one quarter (27.6%) of young people with major depressive disorder based on 
adolescent report had drunk more than 4 drinks in a row in the last 30 days compared with one in ten 
(10.1%) young people with no mental disorder. Higher rates of alcohol consumption were seen in 
young people with other mental disorders than in young people with no disorder, but these rates 
were less than in young people with major depressive disorder (Table 12-2).

12.3 Cannabis and other drugs 
Overall one in ten (11.6%) young people aged 13-17 years had ever used cannabis, and one in twenty 
(5.0%) had used cannabis in the last 30 days. Some 4.5% of young people had ever used other drugs 
and 1.6% had used other drugs in the last 30 days (e.g. prescription drugs for non-medical purposes, 
ecstasy, amphetamines, cocaine). Rates of drug use were broadly similar between males and females. 
Higher rates of drug use were seen in young people with major depressive disorder. Among young 
people with major depressive disorder identified from adolescent report 28.8% had ever used 
cannabis, and 13.1% had used cannabis in the last 30 days, while 16.1% had used other drugs, and 
6.1% had used other drugs in the last 30 days. Among young people with other mental disorders 
identified from parent or carer report, rates of drug use were higher compared with young people with 
no mental disorder, but not as high as for young people with major depressive disorder. Among young 
people with other mental disorders 18.9% had ever used cannabis, 8.6% had used cannabis in the last 
30 days, 9.8% had used other drugs and 3.7% had used other drugs in the last 30 days (Table 12-3).

12.4 Problem eating behaviours 
Based upon self-report of their heights and weights, 6.1% of 11-17 year-olds had a BMI that placed 
them in the underweight range, 19.4% were in the overweight range and 6.7% were in the obese range 
using established age-specific BMI cut-offs1 (Table 12-4 ).

Among young people with major depressive disorder based on self-report, 10.5% had a BMI in the obese 
range, compared with 5.9% of those with no mental disorder. The difference was largest for males with 
16.7% of males with major depressive disorder based on self-report in the obese range compared with 
5.8% of males with no disorder. A higher proportion of males with major depressive disorder were in the 
underweight range (10.6% compared with 5.3%) while a lower proportion of females with major 
depressive disorder were in the underweight range (4.2% compared with 6.7%) (Table 12-5).

Low weight problem eating behaviour (where the young person was assessed as underweight on the 
age-adjusted BMI scale and was practising weight controlling behaviours such as dieting, fasting, 
vomiting or using laxatives or regularly exercising when they were supposed to be doing other things) 
was identified in 1.1% of 11-17 year-olds. Differences between males and females and between 
younger and older adolescents were not statistically significant (Table 12-6). 
Binge eating and purging problem eating behaviour (where a young person of normal weight BMI or 
higher was both binge eating and either vomiting or taking laxatives to control weight) was identified 
in 1.3% of 11-17 year-olds. Differences between males and females and between younger and older 
adolescents were not statistically significant (Table 12-6). Prevalence of the individual behaviours 
used to define low weight problem eating behaviour and binge eating and purging problem eating 
behaviour is shown in Supplementary Table S-68. 
Taken together, 1.6% of males and 3.2% of females had either low weight or binge either and purging 
problem eating behaviours. Among 11-15 year-olds proportions were similar for males and females. 
However among 16-17 year-olds a higher proportion of females (4.9%) had either low weight or binge 
either and purging problem eating behaviours than males (0.7%). 
Not all young people identified with problem eating behaviours in these questions would be expected 
to receive a formal diagnosis of an eating disorder under DSM-IV.

12.5 Sexual behaviours 
Young people aged 13-17 years were asked several questions about their sexual activity. These 
questions were sourced from the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System questionnaire developed by 
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States. Overall, 14.9% of young 
people aged 13-17 years had ever had sexual intercourse and 4.2% reported having had sexual 
intercourse with 4 or more persons (Table 12-7). 
The proportion of young people who had ever had sexual intercourse was higher in adolescents who 
had mental disorders and highest in young people with major depressive disorder. Among young 
people with major depressive disorder based on adolescent report, 38.0% had ever had sexual 
intercourse, compared with 11.5% among young people with no mental disorder. Some 13.4% of 
young people with major depressive disorder based on adolescent report had had sexual intercourse 
with four or more persons during their life compared with 2.8% of young people with no mental 
disorder.

Two thirds of sexually active young people used a condom during last sexual intercourse (66.0%) and 
two fifths (39.7%) used birth control pills. Around one in ten young people did not use any method to 
prevent pregnancy or sexually transmitted infections during last sexual intercourse (11.5%). This was 
higher for young people with mental disorders other than major depressive disorder (19.1% 
compared with 9.6% among young people with no mental disorder).  
Young people with major depressive disorder were more likely to have drunk alcohol or used drugs 
before last sexual intercourse (27.8% based on adolescent report compared with 20.6% of young 
people with no mental disorder). Almost 40% of young people with mental disorders other than major 
depressive disorder drank alcohol or used drugs before last sexual intercourse (Table 12-8).

12.6 Bullying 
Bullying covered both face-to-face teasing, threatening, spreading rumours and physically hurting 
another person, and cyber bullying when mobile phones and/or the internet were used to send 
emails or messages, post comments or pictures, or pretend to be someone online with the aim of 
hurting or threatening another person. 
One quarter (24.3%) of young people aged 11-17 years had been bullied every few months or less 
often in the previous year and another 10.0% had been bullied every few weeks or more often 
(Table 12-9). 
Slightly more younger adolescents experienced bullying, with 11.2% of 11-15 year-olds and 7.1% of 
16-17 year-olds being bullied every few weeks or more often.  
Three fifths of young people with major depressive disorder (62.8% based on self-report) had been 
bullied in the previous year. This was twice the proportion among those with no disorder (30.2%). The 
difference in proportions was greatest for those who were bullied more often, with 28.3% of 11-17 
year-olds with major depressive disorder based on self-report having been bullied every few weeks or 
more often in the previous 12 months. This proportion was over three times higher the proportion of 
young people with no mental disorder (7.6%) (Table 12-9).

Overall 11.3% of young people felt either ‘a lot’ or ‘extremely’ upset as a result of bullying in the 
previous 12 months. The proportion who felt this way was far higher for young people with major 
depressive disorder, with 39.4% of those with major depressive disorder based on adolescent report 
feeling either ‘a lot’ or ‘extremely’ upset as a result of bullying (Table 12-10). It is not possible to 
establish if the depression was caused by or contributed to the bullying.

One in eight (12.7%) young people bullied someone else every few months or less often and 2.0% did 
so at least every few weeks or more often. Young people with major depressive disorder were more 
likely to have bullied someone else than those with other disorders or no disorders (22.5% based on 
self-report compared with 13.8% with other disorders and 13.1% with no disorder) (Table 12-11).

There was a strong relationship between being bullied and bullying another person. Just over one 
quarter (28.7%) of young people who were bullied in the previous 12 months had bullied another 
person. Whereas only 7.5% of young people who had not been bullied did so. 
12.7 Internet use and electronic games 
Most young people spend several hours per day on the internet or playing electronic games, but a 
small proportion of young people spent much larger proportions of time on the internet or gaming. 
On average, males spent more time playing electronic games than females, even though males and 
females spend similar amounts of time using the internet. Some 5.3% of males didn’t use electronic 
games compared with 24.8% of females. Some 4.1% of males used electronic games for an average of 
9 hours or more on an average weekday, and 7.8% used electronic games for an average of 9 hours or 
more on weekends, compared with 0.9% and 1.4% of females (Table 12-12).  
Only a small proportion of young people did not use the internet (1.1%). Among 11-15 year-olds, only 
3.7% of males did not play electronic games while almost one fifth of females (19%) did not do so. The 
proportions rose to 9.4% of 16-17 year-old males and 37.6% of 16-17 year-old females (see 
Supplementary Table S-70).

Young people were asked several questions that may be indicators of potential addictive behaviours 
such as going without eating or sleeping because of the internet or electronic games. The prevalence 
of these individual behaviours is shown in Supplementary Table S-71. Significant proportions of 
young people reported one or more of these indicators. For this report, problem internet or electronic 
gaming behaviours have been defined as reporting four or five of these individual indicators. About 
3.5% of males aged 11-15 years, 3.0% of females 11-15 years, 4.4% of males 16-17 years and 6.5% of 
females 16-17 years reported this level of problem behaviours.  
Problem internet or gaming behaviour is more common in young people with mental disorders, 
particularly young people with major depressive disorder. Some 13.0% of young people with major 
depressive disorder identified through the adolescent self-report questionnaire reported four of five of 
these problem behaviours compared with 3.1% of young people with no identified mental disorder 
(Table 12-13).

13 WHAT ADOLESCENTS TOLD US ABOUT SERVICE USE 
AND SEEKING HELP 
This chapter reports on services and other help, both formal and informal, that young people used for 
emotional or behavioural problems as reported by 13-17 year-olds themselves. 
Information about use of services, informal supports, and self-help strategies is presented for all 13-17 
year-old adolescents and then by mental health status, that is, adolescents who: 
i. 
met diagnostic criteria identified in DSM-IV for major depressive disorder based on their own 
responses;  
ii. 
met diagnostic criteria for any mental disorder identified in DSM-IV based on parent and 
carer report (including major depressive disorder); and  
iii. 
had no mental disorder on the basis of their own self-report, or parent or carer report.  
This chapter also reports on adolescents’ perceived need for mental health care and the barriers that 
they identified to seeking help or getting more help for their emotional or behavioural problems when 
they had a mental disorder on the basis of their own report, or from parent and carer reports. 
13.1 Service use by all adolescents 
For the purpose of reporting service use in this section, a summary measure of 'service use' was 
created that included all health, school and telephone counselling services, but only those online 
services that provide structured or personalised assistance. While valuable in their own right, online 
services where information is accessed on the internet but no other service is provided were excluded 
from this composite measure. 
 ‘Services’ comprised the following:  
i. 
health services — any service provided by a qualified health professional regardless of 
where that service was provided including in the community, hospital inpatient, outpatient 
and emergency, and private rooms; 
ii. 
school services — any service provided by the school or other educational institution that a 
young person was attending;  
iii. 
telephone counselling services; and  
iv. 
online services that provided personalised assessment, support, counselling or structured 
self-help programs. 
Overall, 18.0% of 13-17 year-olds reported using services for emotional and behavioural problems in 
the previous 12 months (Table 13-1). This figure of 18.0% is slightly less than the 21.4% of all 12-17 
year-olds reported to have used services by their parents and carers as discussed in Chapter 7. The 
proportion of females who reported using services was almost twice that of males (23.6% compared 
with 12.7%).

13.2 headspace  
headspace is the Australian Government funded National Youth Mental Health Foundation providing 
support to young people aged 12-25 years who are experiencing mild to moderate mental health 
concerns and/or substance use issues.  
13.2.1 All adolescents 
Just over one third (37.2%) of all 13-17 year-olds had heard about headspace.  
Among all adolescents, 3.4% had either been in contact with a health professional by telephone or 
online (1.6%) or had visited a headspace centre (2.8%) (Table 13-2). A larger proportion of 13-17 year-
olds had accessed information via the headspace or eheadspace websites (5.7%). More females than 
males had accessed headspace services (10.2% versus 4.8%) largely due to higher proportions 
accessing information on the websites.

(43.6%) of those with mental disorders based on parent and carer report had heard about headspace.  
   
 
 
 
The Mental Health of Children and Adolescents 123 
 
 
One fifth (20.2%) of 13-17 year-olds with major depressive disorder reported using a service provided 
by headspace, with the majority of these accessing information on the headspace website or through 
eheadspace (14.8%). One twelfth (8.5%) spoke to a mental health professional on the telephone or 
received online support, and 11.0% visited a headspace centre (Table 13-3).

In contrast, compared to those with self-reported major depressive disorder, fewer adolescents with 
mental disorders based on parent and carer report (13.0%) had used headspace services for 
emotional or behavioural problems in the previous 12 months although a similar proportion (8.2%) 
reported having visited a headspace centre. 
A small proportion of adolescents (5.8%) with no mental disorders based on either adolescent or 
parent or carer report had used headspace services in the previous 12 months. 
13.3 Telephone counselling and online services 
This section reports on use of telephone helplines such as Kids Helpline and online services including 
services provided by headspace, Reachout and Youth beyondblue for emotional and behavioural 
problems. 
13.3.1  All adolescents 
Of all 13-17 year-olds, 3.6% reported using a telephone counselling line for help or information in the 
previous 12 months. The proportion was twice as high among females than males (4.8% compared 
with 2.4%). 
Just over one fifth (22.2%) of 13-17 year-olds had used an online service in the previous 12 months for 
help or information about emotional or behavioural problems (Table 13-4). The proportion was 
almost twice as high among females than males (28.9% compared with 15.9%). In particular, females 
were twice as likely to seek information about mental health issues, to use an online assessment tool 
or online personal support or counselling.

13.3.2 Adolescents with mental disorders 
Among all 13-17 year-olds with major depressive disorder based on adolescent report, 13.6% had 
used a telephone counselling service, such as Kids Helpline, in the previous 12 months. Less (7.1%) of 
those with mental disorders based on parent and carer report had used a telephone counselling 
service for emotional or behavioural problems in the previous 12 months. 
Half (52.0%) of those with major depressive disorder based on adolescent report had used an online 
service including services provided by headspace, Reachout and Youth beyondblue, to get help or 
information about emotional or behavioural problems in the previous 12 months (Table 13-5).  
The main use of online services by 13-17 year-olds with major depressive disorder was to find 
information about mental health issues (40.2%). Some websites provide access to an online 
assessment tool and 29.6% of 13-17 year-olds with a major depressive disorder had used such a tool 
(or questionnaire) to find out if they needed help. Others had participated in a chat room or support 
group (8.6%), received online personal support or counselling (7.4%) or self-help (14.8%). 
Use of online services for emotional or behavioural problems was higher among adolescents with 
major depressive disorder than for those with mental disorders based on parent and carer report 
(29.9%). More than twice the proportion of 13-17 year-olds with self-reported major depressive 
disorder compared to those with mental disorders as reported by parents and carers had accessed 
information about mental health issues (40.2% compared with 20.9%), used an online assessment 
tool (29.6% compared to 12.4%) or online self-help (14.8% compared with 6.3%) in the previous 12 
months. 
One fifth (18.7%) of adolescents with no mental disorder based on either their own report or parent or 
carer report had used an online service in the past 12 months. The main use of online services by this 
group without mental disorders was for information about mental health issues (11.5%) and for 
access to an online assessment tool (8.0%).

13.4 Informal help or support 
Adolescents may often receive help with their problems from family members, friends, teachers at 
school or other adults in their lives. 
13.4.1  All adolescents 
Nearly two thirds (62.9%) of all adolescents had received informal help or support for emotional or 
behavioural problems in the previous 12 months (Table 13-6). This proportion was higher among 
females than males (74.3% compared with 52.1%). Most commonly young people received informal 
help or support from a friend (48.5%), a parent (46.1%) or a boyfriend or girlfriend (32.7%).

13.4.2  Adolescents with mental disorders 
Most 13-17 year-olds with major depressive disorder by adolescent report (93.9%) or with mental 
disorders by parent and carer report (80.3%) had received informal help or support for emotional or 
behavioural problems in the previous 12 months (Table 13-7).  
Friends and parents were the most common sources of informal help or support for 13-17 year-olds 
with major depressive disorder, with 78.5% receiving help from a friend and 64.1% from a parent. Just 
over a quarter had received informal support from a teacher and one third from another school staff 
member, such as a counsellor or nurse (28.7% and 35.8% respectively).  
Sources of support were similar for those with mental disorders by parent and carer report compared 
to those with major depressive disorder by adolescent report. The exception was lower proportions 
among those with any mental disorder receiving support from a friend (57.2%) or boyfriend or 
girlfriend if applicable (45.1%). 
More than half (57.9%) of 13-17 year-olds without mental disorders had received informal support or 
help for emotional or behavioural problems in the previous 12 months.

13.5 Self-help strategies 
Adolescents also reported other strategies they adopted to help them manage any emotional or 
behavioural problems that they may have had or to avoid having such problems. 
13.5.1 All adolescents 
Two thirds (66.4%) of all adolescents had adopted some kind of strategy to help themselves manage 
or avoid emotional or behavioural problems in the previous 12 months (Table 13-8). This proportion 
   
 
 
 
The Mental Health of Children and Adolescents 127 
 
 
was higher among females than males (73.2% compared with 59.9%). Most commonly, adolescents 
did more of the things that they enjoyed (45.1%), did more exercise or took up a sport (37.9%), sought 
support from friends (24.4%) and improved their diet (23.2%).

13.5.2 Adolescents with mental disorders 
Among 13-17 year-olds with major depressive disorder by adolescent report, 84.2% had used some 
kind of strategy to help themselves with problems they were experiencing in the previous 12 months 
(Table 13-9). 
To help manage their emotional or behavioural problems, adolescents with major depressive 
disorder most commonly did more exercise or took up a sport (44.3%), did more of the activities that 
they enjoyed (44.0%) and sought support from friends (42.5%). However, almost a third (31.5%) of 
adolescents with major depressive disorder smoked cigarettes or used alcohol or drugs to help 
manage their problems.  
Three quarters (75.0%) of adolescents with mental disorders based on parent on carer report had 
adopted self-help strategies for emotional or behavioural problems. Mostly the types of strategies 
were similar although a higher proportion of those with major depressive disorder compared with 
those with any mental disorder had sought support from friends (42.5% compared with 24.6%) or 
smoked cigarettes, or used alcohol or drugs (31.5% compared with 19.1%) to help manage their own 
emotional or behavioural problems. 
Nearly two thirds of those with no mental disorder by their own report or parent or carer report had 
used some kind of self-help strategy in the previous 12 months (63.5%).

13.6 Perceived need for help and barriers to receiving mental health care 
Adolescents aged 13-17 years were asked about what help they needed with their emotional or 
behavioural problems and whether their needs for this kind of help had been met. The help was 
categorised into four types:  
 
Information about emotional or behavioural problems, treatment and available services; 
 
Prescribed medication for emotional or behavioural problems;  
 
Counselling or a talking therapy about problems or difficulties (either one-on-one, as a family, 
or in a group); and 
 
Courses or other counselling for life skills, self-esteem or motivation. 
13.6.1  Perceived need for help for young people with disorders 
Four fifths of adolescents with major depressive disorder (82.4%) reported a need for one or more 
types of help for emotional or behavioural problems in the previous 12 months (Table 13-10). Of those 
adolescents with major depressive disorder that reported a need for one or more types of help, three 
quarters (76.8%) reported that their needs were met either fully (28.1%) or partially (48.7%), while one 
quarter (23.2%) had needs that were unmet. 
The most common type of help adolescents with major depressive disorder felt that they needed in 
the previous 12 months was counselling or a talking therapy (68.8%) and of these, 70.4% reported that 
their needs were met either fully (39.0%) or partially (31.4%). 
   
 
 
 
The Mental Health of Children and Adolescents 129 
 
 
More than half of adolescents with major depressive disorder (55.9%) reported a need for information 
about emotional or behavioural problems, treatment and available services of which one fifth (21.4%) 
reported that their needs were unmet. 
The greatest areas of unmet need according to adolescents with major depressive disorder who had 
reported a need for help were for courses or other counselling for life skills, self-esteem or motivation 
(51.5%) and for prescribed medication (44.2%).

About half (56.4%) of adolescents with a mental disorder identified by parents and carers reported a 
need for one or more types of help for emotional or behavioural problems in the previous 12 months 
(Table 13-11).Of those adolescents with mental disorders that reported a need for one or more types 
of help, about nine out of ten (86.9%) reported that their needs were met either fully (47.5%) or 
partially (39.4%) while one tenth (13.1%) had needs that were unmet. 
Counselling was the type of need most commonly reported (41.6%) by adolescents with mental 
disorders based on parent and carer report. Of those adolescents reporting a need for counselling or 
talking therapy, 84.8% reported that their needs were either fully met (57.7%) or partially met (27.1%).  
One third of adolescents with mental disorders identified by parents and carers (35.7%) reported a 
need for information about emotional or behavioural problems, treatment and available services, of 
which four fifths (81.8%) reported that their needs were met either fully (55.8%) or partially (26.0%). 
About three in ten (28.3%) identified a need for medication, of which just under a third (31.5%) had 
unmet need. One fifth (22.8%) reported a need for counselling for life skills, counselling for life skills, 
self-esteem or motivation, of which nearly two fifths (37.9%) had unmet need.  
Compared to 13-17 year-olds with a major depressive disorder by their own report, those with mental 
disorders identified by parent and carer report had lower levels of unmet need for all types of help.

13.6.2  Perceived need by severity of impact 
The extent to which 13-17 year-olds reported a perceived need for help with their emotional or 
behavioural problems increased with severity of disorder. Those with moderate and severe disorders 
had greater perceived need than those with mild disorders. For those with some need for assistance, 
the proportion of young people whose needs were fully or partially met also increased with the 
severity of their disorder, with more moderate and severe cases having these needs fully or partially 
met. These relationships were found regardless of whether the identification of mental disorders was 
based only on the young person’s self-report of major depressive disorder or on the information 
about a broader range of mental disorders provided by the parent or carer. 
For adolescents identified as having a severe or moderate major depressive disorder based on their 
own self report, most indicated that they had a need for help with emotional and behavioural 
problems (90.7% and 94.8% respectively). A lower proportion (65.4%) of those with mild depressive 
disorder felt that they had a need for some type of help (Table 13-12). 
Around nine in ten (87.9%) adolescents with a severe major depressive disorder who reported some 
type of need for help indicated that their needs were either fully (24.9%) or partially (63.0%) met. 
Lower rates of fully or partially met need were reported by adolescents with moderate (69.4%) and 
mild depressive disorders (70.2%).

For adolescents aged 13-17 years identified as having mental disorders based on the information 
provided by parents and carers, a larger percentage of those with severe (70.0%) and moderate 
disorders (67.8%) indicated a need for help than those with mild disorders (41.1%) (Table 13-13). 
About nine in ten of those with a severe or moderate disorder (91.2% and 90.2% respectively) who 
reported some type of need for help indicated that their needs were either fully met (42.4% for severe 
disorders and 49.4% for moderate disorders) or partially met (48.8% for severe disorders and 40.8% 
for moderate disorders). Slightly lower rates (79.2%) of met need (fully or partially) were reported by 
adolescents identified as having mild disorders.

13.6.3  Comparing adolescent and parent or carer views about perceived need for help 
Adolescents aged 13-17 years with mental disorders based on the information provided by their 
parent or carer were less likely to report a need for any help than parents and carers (56.4% compared 
to 84.8%) (Table 13-14). Parents and carers were more likely to report a need for help for all types of 
help except for prescribed medication were a similar proportion of adolescents reported a need for 
help.

13.6.4  Barriers to seeking and receiving help 
The most commonly identified reasons given by 13-17 year-olds with major depressive disorder by 
adolescent report for not seeking help or receiving more help for emotional or behavioural problems 
were being worried about what other people might think or not wanting to talk to a stranger (62.9%), 
thinking the problem would get better by itself (61.7%) and wanting to work out the problem on their 
own or with help from family or friends (57.1%) (Table 13-15). 
Among adolescents with mental disorders based on information provided by their parents and carers, 
the most common reasons cited for not seeking help or receiving more help were similar to those with 
major depressive disorder but proportions identifying these reasons were lower for most categories.

If adolescents reported more than one reason for not seeking help or receiving more help, they were 
also asked to identify the main reason. The most common main reasons for adolescents with major 
depressive disorder not seeking help or not receiving more help included not being sure if they 
needed help, where to get help or thinking that the problem would get better by itself, issues which 
could be broadly classified as mental health literacy (33.1%) (Table 13-16). 
Just over one quarter of adolescents with major depressive disorder (26.2%) identified reasons 
related to them wishing to manage their problems themselves, and another quarter (27.9%) reported 
being worried about what other people might think or not wanting to talk about it with a stranger, as 
the main reason for not seeking help or receiving more help for emotional and behavioural problems. 
One eighth (12.8%) identified reasons that related to accessibility of services, such as thinking it might 
cost too much, having a problem getting to a service that could help or not being able to get an 
appointment when needed. 
Among adolescents with a mental disorder identified by parents and carers, the main reason 
identified for not seeking help or receiving more help included not being sure if they needed help,

where to get help or thinking that the problem would get better by itself, primarily to do with issues of 
mental health literacy (42.3%).  One quarter (26.7%) of adolescents with mental disorders identified 
the desire to manage their problem by themselves or with help from family or friends as being the 
main reason for not seeking help or receiving more help.

Changes over time 
 
Changes in the prevalence of mental disorders 
and service use among children and adolescents 
since 1998 
 
 
Young Minds Matter was the second national child and adolescent survey 
of mental health and wellbeing conducted in Australia. The first survey 
was conducted in 1998. It was led by a consortium from the University of 
Adelaide and provided the first national data on the prevalence of mental 
disorders and service use in Australian children and adolescents. 
Although there are a number of significant differences between the first 
and second surveys, many of the essential elements remain the same. 
Both surveys used the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children Version IV 
(DISC-IV) to assess mental disorders. Three disorders were common to 
both surveys and data on the prevalence of these disorders are 
compared. 
Each survey determined the use of services by children and adolescents 
for their emotional and behavioural problems and, more specifically, the 
use by young people with mental disorders. The timeframe over which 
this was collected differed between the surveys and make comparisons 
difficult, but these data are explored further.

14 COMPARISON WITH 1998 NATIONAL SURVEY OF 
MENTAL HEALTH AND WELLBEING 
Young Minds Matter was the second national Child and Adolescent Survey of Mental Health and 
Wellbeing conducted in Australia. The first survey was conducted in 1998.  
While it is possible to make some comparisons between the 1998 and 2013-14 surveys, these need to 
take into account the similarities and differences between the two surveys.  
When the 1998 Child and Adolescent Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing was conducted it was the 
first national survey of its type conducted anywhere in the world. The survey assessed five common 
disorders using the DISC version IV, namely — major depressive disorder, dysthymic disorder, 
attention-deficit /hyperactivity disorder, conduct disorder, and eating disorders. The DISC-IV was a 
recognised diagnostic tool developed under the auspices of the National Institute of Mental Health in 
the United States to assess whether children and adolescents had mental disorders according to the 
criteria of the standard diagnostic classification, the DSM-IV. In addition mental health problems were 
assessed using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). 
Young Minds Matter also used the DISC-IV to assess mental disorders. However, there were some 
changes to the list of disorders that were assessed. Major depressive disorder, ADHD, and conduct 
disorder were assessed as well as four anxiety disorders, that is — social phobia, separation anxiety, 
generalised anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorder. In addition, the Strengths and Difficulties 
Questionnaire (SDQ) was used in Young Minds Matter rather than the Child Behavior Checklist. 
This chapter reports on changes in prevalence of mental disorders between 1998 and 2013-14 for the 
three mental disorders common to both surveys (major depressive disorder, ADHD, and conduct 
disorder). Comparisons were restricted to children and adolescents aged 6-17 years as the first survey 
did not administer the DISC-IV modules to parents and carers of children aged 4-5 years. This chapter 
also makes some comparison between use of services in 1998 and 2013-14, although this comparison 
needs to be interpreted with caution as the 1998 survey collected information on use of services in the 
6 months prior to the survey while the 2013-14 survey collected information on use of services in the 
12 months prior to the survey. 
14.1 Prevalence of selected mental disorders by sex and age group 
Between 1998 and 2013-14, the prevalence of major depressive disorder increased (from 2.1% to 
3.2%), while the prevalence of conduct disorder and ADHD decreased (from 2.7% to 2.1% for conduct 
disorder and from 9.8% to 7.8% for ADHD). The proportion of 6-17 year-olds who had any of these 
three disorders decreased slightly from 12.2% to 11.1% (Table 14-1). 
Although there was very little difference between the two surveys in the prevalence of the three 
disorders for females, the prevalences of ADHD and conduct disorders were somewhat lower for 
males in 2013-14 than in 1998. Among males aged from 6 to 17 years the prevalence of ADHD declined 
from 13.8% to 11.0% and the prevalence of conduct disorder declined from 4.0% to 2.6% (Table 14-2). 
 138 The Mental Health of Children and Adolescents 
 
There were changes in the prevalence of the three disorders concentrated in particular age groups. 
There was no change in the prevalence of major depressive disorder between 1998 and 2013-14 
among children aged 6-11 years. However, the prevalence of major depressive disorder among 12-17 
year-olds increased from 2.9% to 5.0% (Table 14-1). 
For ADHD, the decrease in prevalence overall was due to the decrease in prevalence among children 
aged 6-11 years, from 16.7% to 12.3% in males and from 8.3% to 5.9% in females. The decrease in the 
prevalence of conduct disorder was predominantly due to a decrease in males aged 6-11 years from 
4.6% to 2.6% (Table 14-2).  
In summary, comparison of the three disorders included in both the 1998 and 2013-14 surveys 
suggests that overall prevalence has remained relatively stable, with modest declines in prevalence of 
ADHD and conduct disorder and a modest increase in the prevalence of major depressive disorder.

14.2 Use of services 
Information on service use is not directly comparable between the two surveys. In 1998, parents and 
carers were asked about use of services in the previous 6 months, while in Young Minds Matter they 
were asked about use of services in the previous 12 months. The service use module was completely 
rewritten for Young Minds Matter based on the current Australian health care environment and there 
were several differences in the types of services included in both surveys. 
In order to provide some comparison of service use between 1998 and 2013-14, services common to 
both surveys were identified. These included school services (counselling, a place in a special class or 
school or other school or education-based service for emotional or behavioural problems) and health 
services (GP, psychologist, psychiatrist, paediatrician, overnight stay in a hospital or longer, hospital 
outpatient or emergency services, community mental health clinic, or telephone counselling service). 
Among children and adolescents aged 6-17 years with either major depressive disorder, ADHD or 
conduct disorder, 31.2% had used services in the six months prior to the 1998 survey, while 68.3% had 
used services in the 12 months prior to the 2013-14 survey. There was a greater apparent change in 
use of school services for emotional or behavioural problems. In the six months prior to the 1998 
survey 19.2% of children or adolescents with one of the three mental disorders common to both 
surveys had used a school service, while 54.0% of children or adolescents had used a school service in 
the 12 months prior to the 2013-14 survey. 
While differences in questions and time period make comparisons difficult, the increase in use of 
services is higher than is likely to be attributable to changes in methodology alone. On balance, the 
data suggest that there has been a significant increase in service use by children and adolescents with 
mental disorders in Australia between 1998 and 2013-14.

APPENDIX 1 - CONDUCT OF THE SURVEY 
Young Minds Matter was based on a sample of over 6,000 children and adolescents aged 4-17 years 
recruited from across Australia. Information was collected from parents and carers and young people 
by trained lay interviewers from Roy Morgan Research using computer-assisted personal interviewing.  
Parents and carers were interviewed in their homes about one randomly selected child or adolescent 
in the family. The interview was conducted with the parent or carer who identified as knowing most 
about the child or adolescent. If the selected child or adolescent was aged 11 years or older, the 
young person was asked to complete a confidential questionnaire on a tablet computer. 
Fieldwork commenced on 30th May 2013 and concluded on 12th April 2014. 
1. Process issues 
Selection of survey content 
The contents of both the parent and carer questionnaire and youth self-report questionnaire were 
decided by a set of principles determined at the beginning of the survey development process. These 
primarily addressed issues relating to the main aims of the survey, as well as what is desirable in the 
conduct of a household survey for maximising data quality. 
The principal focus of the survey was on determining the prevalence of mental disorders and their 
impact, and on services used by children and adolescents with mental health problems and 
disorders. Determining whether someone has a mental disorder requires assessment against 
diagnostic criteria for that particular disorder. In terms of the survey, this means that diagnostic 
modules were required for each disorder. For the first survey, selected modules from the DISC-IV were 
used to assess mental disorders. These could be administered by lay interviewers, required no clinical 
assessment for diagnoses and were designed for epidemiological use. In 2013, the DISC-IV remained 
the most up-to-date version of the instrument and was still the best tool available world-wide for 
assessing the 12-month prevalence of disorders, as needed for national planning purposes and to 
complement data on adults. 
The full DISC-IV covers 30 disorders and takes on average 70 minutes to complete. If all disorders were 
included in the survey, very little other content could be covered. Therefore specific modules of the 
DISC-IV covering selected disorders rather than all disorders were selected, as was the case for other 
National Surveys of Mental Health and Wellbeing undertaken in Australia. Decisions around what 
disorders were to be included were based strictly upon the relative prevalence and impact of 
disorders as indicated by previous population estimates from the first survey and more recent 
overseas surveys. Major depressive disorder, ADHD and conduct disorder, which were in the first 
national survey, were included once again because of their high prevalence and impact. 
Although not included in the first survey, it was resolved that anxiety disorders should also be 
included in recognition not only of the high prevalence of these disorders, but also because of the 
high proportion of people with anxiety disorders in the 2007 National Survey of Mental Health and 
Wellbeing who reported first onset of their anxiety problems in childhood or adolescence. There is, 
 144 The Mental Health of Children and Adolescents 
 
 
however, not just one, but nine DISC-IV anxiety modules to align with the different types of anxiety 
disorders in the DSM-IV. Only four were chosen on the basis of their prevalence and impact. These 
were social phobia, separation anxiety disorder, generalised anxiety disorder and obsessive-
compulsive disorder. 
Another aim of the survey was to determine service use by children and adolescents with mental 
health problems and disorders — not only what proportion of young people was receiving services, 
but also where they got help. All the main types of services for young people with mental health 
problems were covered. These included health, school, telephone counselling, online services and 
informal services and supports. It was also important to understand if young people were getting all 
the services they needed and, if not, why. This content needed to be tailored to the Australian context. 
In addition, there is some standard content that is required in any survey and some particular to 
surveys of children and adolescents. This included information necessary for obtaining informed 
consent, household information, demographics and family characteristics. 
The limits on what can be included are set by the average time for interview and/or completion of a 
questionnaire. In the case of household surveys one of the main considerations when determining the 
length of surveys is the response burden — that is, what is reasonable from other epidemiological 
evidence to ask of participants without affecting data quality. The objective set was to keep the 
average time for the parent and carer interview to 75 minutes. This time was to cover household 
information, informed consents and the questionnaire itself. For adolescents completing their own 
questionnaire, the objective was to keep the average completion time to 20 minutes, with additional 
time on gaining the necessary consents that varied depending upon the age of the young person. In 
the actual survey the median time was very close to the target time for parents and carers, who spent 
60 minutes on average on the questionnaire and five to ten minutes on administrative matters.  
Young people were completing their questionnaires on a tablet computer by themselves and average 
timings were affected by some exceptionally long completion times, most likely due to prolonged 
breaks when the participant or interviewer did not sign out. The median time (35 minutes) provides 
the best indication of the average time taken to complete everything required on the adolescent self-
report questionnaire. 
Rationalisation of the number of diagnostic modules allowed for other content to be covered within 
the average target times. In particular a sufficiently detailed set of questions on service use and some 
questions on school services and performance were added, as well as contextual information from 
parents and carers. Information on self-harm, suicidality and risk taking behaviours were included for 
young people. 
Age range 
Children and adolescents aged from 4-17 years were surveyed. This is the same age range as was 
covered in the first national survey of children and adolescents. 
Children under the age of four years were not included as the problems of younger children differ 
from those of older children and adolescents, as do the methods required to assess them. The main 
diagnostic instrument, the DISC-IV, would not be suitable. Indeed the developers of the instrument 
have recommended its use with young people aged 6-18 years. While six years is the lower 
   
 
 
 
The Mental Health of Children and Adolescents 145 
 
recommended limit, DISC-IV modules have been used in a few studies on children as young as four 
and five years, but no younger. In Australia about four fifths of four year-olds attend preschool or long 
day care, while the majority of five year-olds attend school. This provides some context for responses 
on these younger children. It was also considered desirable to use the same diagnostic instruments 
for four and five year-olds as for older children. 
The 2007 National Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing was a general population survey of adults, 
but, unlike the first adult survey in 1997, it surveyed persons aged 16 years and older. Overlap of the 
ages sampled for the two surveys, that is 16 and 17 year olds, was specifically designed to allow for 
subsequent comparison of the data. 
Oversight of the survey 
The Australian Government Department of Health and Ageing funded and managed the conduct of 
the survey as part of the National Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing initiative. This is the sixth 
survey conducted under this initiative. 
A Survey Reference Group of invited mental health, child and adolescent, education and 
epidemiological experts, as well as representatives of the Department and the Australian Bureau of 
Statistics, provided oversight in design, content and implementation of the survey.  
Membership of the Survey Reference Group is provided at Appendix 2. 
2. Sample, fieldwork and participant issues 
Main sample 
The survey sample was selected in two components. The first component was a randomly selected 
sample of 5,500 families with children aged 4-17 years from across the country. 
The sample size was chosen to deliver reliable national estimates of the prevalence, burden and 
service use by sex and for the two age groups of 4-11 and 12-17 years. 
In total 46,248 households were approached to achieve a calculated final sample of 5,500 based on an 
in-scope rate of 21% and a target response rate of 60%.  
Oversample 
In recognition of the increased risks for a range of emotional and behavioural problems in the older 
teenage years, the main survey sample was supplemented by a second component of 16 and 17 year-
olds. This comprised an additional random sample of 800 families with children aged 16-17 years. The 
sample size was determined to be sufficiently large for separate analyses of the data and to produce 
specific estimates for this age group.  
The oversample aimed to allow for the results for just 16 and 17 year-olds to be analysed together 
with that for 16 and 17 year olds from the 2007 adult survey. The combination of data from both 
surveys will provide two perspectives on mental health problems in this age group—one based on 
questions specifically designed for teenagers and one based on questions designed for adults.  
An additional 30,358 households were approached to achieve the required 800 interviews. 
 146 The Mental Health of Children and Adolescents 
 
 
Sampling method 
Area-based sampling was used to select both the main sample and oversample. This method involves 
selecting a sample of small geographic areas (in this case the Statistical Area 1 or SA1 area, designed 
by the Australian Bureau of Statistics). A total of 225 SA1 areas were selected from those where there 
were at least ten families with children living at the time of the 2011 Census of Population and 
Housing conducted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. SA1 areas in very remote areas were 
excluded. 
The SA1s used for the main sample were also used for the oversample. A target of four interviews of 
randomly selected households in each of the 225 SA1s was predicted to deliver the required sample 
of 800 families. However, selection of an additional 41 SA1s was necessary to achieve the desired 800 
interviews. In total 266 SA1s were selected. 
Interviewers went to a randomly selected sample of houses in each SA1 to identify households that 
had one or more children aged from four to 17 years. In households where there was more than one 
resident child aged 4-17 years, the names of all children were entered into the interviewer’s hand-held 
computer, which then selected a child at random as the study participant for the survey. 
Exclusions 
The one percent most remote SA1s in Australia were excluded from the survey for practical reasons. 
This is considered standard practice for surveys that aim to yield estimates at a national level. 
The survey cannot produce estimates of mental disorders and service use for Indigenous peoples. 
Random sampling alone with the number of participants for this survey was not considered sufficient 
for generation of these data within acceptable confidence intervals. A separate Indigenous sample 
was not included as there are important cultural issues in appropriately measuring mental health and 
wellbeing in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children that could not be addressed within the 
framework of the population survey. A separate study would need to be undertaken to assess the 
mental health of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children and young people in a culturally 
appropriate manner. 
The survey was based on a household sample and, as such, children who were homeless or in 
institutional care were not included. Although this is likely to be a small proportion of children and 
adolescents, these sub-populations are known to have a high-risk of mental health problems. 
However, the survey aimed to collect information on children who were temporarily away from home, 
such as at boarding school or in hospital. Parents and carers were asked to list all of the children who 
are usually part of the household, but were temporarily living away, along with those living there. 
These children had an equal chance of selection as the survey child as other children in the family due 
to the computerised random selection methodology. However, young people aged 11 years and older 
who were not living in the household at the time could not be asked to complete the self-report 
questionnaire and therefore there is no additional information from these young people themselves. 
Interviewing process 
Roy Morgan Research was contracted to conduct the survey fieldwork. A team of over 100 trained, lay 
interviewers were employed to complete fieldwork from 31 May 2013 through to 10 April 2014. 
   
 
 
 
The Mental Health of Children and Adolescents 147 
 
Interviewers were trained over three days prior to survey fieldwork. Training covered matters related 
to the conduct of the survey interviews, as well as some basic mental health literacy and information 
on the use of the diagnostic tool, the DISC-IV. A comprehensive training manual and standardised 
curriculum for the three days ensured uniformity of interviewer training across all Australian sites. 
Interviewers were required to approach selected households in their areas up to six times or until they 
were able to gain contact with a resident adult. These contact attempts were required to be made 
over a mixture of weekday/weekend and day/evening calls. Once contact was made with an adult 
living in the household a short screener process was used to confirm that the household was in scope. 
Strategies to encourage participation 
There were a number of strategies used to provide information about the survey, encourage 
participation once contact had been made and, in turn, maximise the response rate. These were as 
follows: 
 
A primary approach letter was given to each household. 
 
Two information brochures — one for the parent or carer and one for the young person, 
were prepared. 
 
A letter of endorsement was signed by three survey ambassadors, namely Professor Fiona 
Stanley, founding director and patron of the Telethon Kids Institute and Australian of the 
Year 2003; Professor Fiona Wood, plastic surgeon specialising in burns and Australian of 
the Year 2005; and Jessica Watson, solo around-the world sailor and Young Australian of 
the Year 2011. 
 
An 1800 number was staffed by Roy Morgan Research to answer any queries or concerns 
participants may have had about the survey. 
 
Information about the survey was available to participants through the Telethon Kids 
Institute website, which was listed on the brochures. 
 
A payment of $40 was offered to parents and carers to compensate them for their time 
completing the interview and young people were offered $20 to compensate them for their 
time completing the youth self-report questionnaire. 
Consent 
Participation in the survey was voluntary and written consent was required from all participants. 
Initially, verbal consent was obtained from parents or carers to participate in the survey. If the child 
was 11 years or older, parents and carers were also asked for their consent to approach the young 
person to ask whether he or she would complete a youth self-report questionnaire. Verbal consent 
was also sought directly from the young person, if he or she were willing to participate. 
Paper consent forms were completed by both parents or carers and young people at the completion 
of the household interviews.  
Additionally, at the end of the household interview, consent was sought from parents and carers to 
access Medicare, Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) and National Assessment Program — 
Literacy and Numeracy (NAPLAN) information for the selected child or young person. Where the 
 148 The Mental Health of Children and Adolescents 
 
 
selected child was aged under 14 years, consent to access Medicare and PBS data was sought from 
the primary carer, while, with the parent or carer’s permission, consent was sought from the young 
person directly if they were aged 14 years or older. For NAPLAN data, consent was sought from the 
primary carer, as NAPLAN testing covers school years 3, 5, 7, and 9. At the time of writing, the process 
of obtaining the Medicare, PBS and NAPLAN data for children and adolescents from the relevant data 
custodians is underway. These data will be used for future analysis subsequent to this report. 
Participants were informed that they had the right to withdraw their consent for study participation or 
the use of their information at any time during the interview and up to 31 March 2014, at which time 
final validation was being completed and data would be de-identified for inclusion in the main unit 
record file. A decision was made to extend the period for fieldwork part way through the initial 
collection phase and, in turn, the cut-off for withdrawal of consent for use of information was 
extended to 30 April 2014 for participants in this later phase of fieldwork. 
Duty of care 
Specific protocols were developed to ensure that if any issues arose for participants in response to the 
survey, there were options available to assist them in receiving the information and support they 
required. 
Training of interviewers included specific training in how to deal with difficult and distressing 
situations if these arose while the interviewer was in the household. Interviewers were instructed to 
give the participant space and offer to come back at another time to complete the interview. They 
were directed not to offer opinions or advice, but direct participants to services listed in the brochures 
and, if required, provide the 1800 number for the on-call study psychologist. 
If the participant required support after the interviewer had left the household, a number of options 
were available. Brochures for both parents or carers and young people, which listed relevant helplines 
or other services accessible by phone or on the internet, were left with the household. The survey 
website provided further information about the survey and links to relevant mental health services. A 
1800 telephone number staffed by Roy Morgan Research, which participants could call to discuss any 
aspect of the survey or issue arising from the interview, was available. In addition, the on-call study 
psychologist was available at all times. 
State and territory child and adolescent specialised mental health services were notified when the 
survey was going to be in the field in case calls were received from participants. 
The 1800 on-call study psychologist received a total of 5 calls over the duration of survey fieldwork. 
There were no adverse events reported as a result of the survey. 
Interviewers also were supported, with access to the on-call study psychologist, specific debriefing 
procedures and support directly through Roy Morgan Research. 
3. Questionnaires 
Parent Interview 
The median time to complete the parent and carer questionnaire was 60 minutes. All participants 
were asked questions in all modules. These were as follows: 
   
 
 
 
The Mental Health of Children and Adolescents 149 
 
 
Family structure — sex, age, marital status, country of birth, language spoken for all family 
members and relationships between all members of the family; 


diagnosed with psychological, emotional or behavioural problems from a list provided; 
 
Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children (DISC-IV) modules; 
 
Level of functional impairment questions; 
 
Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) Parent Report Measure Baseline versions 
for Children (4-10 years) and for Youth (11-17 years); 
 
Service use in the past 12 months;

and housing tenure. 
Youth self-report questionnaire 
Young people aged 11 years and over were asked to complete a self-report questionnaire on a tablet 
computer in private. Median time to complete the questionnaire was 35 minutes. As some of the 
questions were considered inappropriate for younger children, some modules were only asked of 
young people older than a specified age. This questionnaire comprised the following modules: 
 
DISC-IV major depressive disorder module; 
 
Level of functional impairment questions; 
 
Presence of symptoms of psychosis; 
 
Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) Youth Self Report Baseline version; 
 
Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10+), which has the basic ten questions about how 
the child is feeling and another four on how it affected him or her in the last four weeks; 
 
Child health utility-9D, which is composed of nine questions designed to measure quality 
of life for use in economic evaluation; 
 
Service use in past 12 months — health, school, telephone counselling and online services 
and informal supports (13 years and older); 
 
Perceived need for services; 
 
Education — school attendance, performance in core subjects, and school connectedness; 
 
Youth risk behaviours consisted of six sections, with questions varying for different ages —
 smoking (screener questions only for 11 and 12 year-olds); alcohol consumption (screener 
questions only for 11 and 12 year-olds) and use of other drugs (13 years and older); self-
harm (12 years and older); suicidal behaviours (12 years and older); problem eating

 
Experiences of bullying, both as victim and perpetrator; and 
 
Level of self-esteem. 
4. Content issues 
Assessment of mental disorders 
Mental disorders were assessed using the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children Version IV (DISC-
IV). The DISC-IV implements the criteria for mental disorders set out in the Diagnostic and Statistical 
Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition1, produced by the American Psychiatric Association. These 
criteria are based on clinically significant sets of symptoms that are associated with impaired 
functioning by young people with disorders. 
The tool was particularly suited to the survey as it was developed primarily for epidemiological 
research and can be administered by trained, lay interviewers. The most recent version, the DISC-IV, is 
able to address more than 30 psychiatric diagnoses based on DSM-IV criteria that occur in children 
and adolescents. Most questions are worded so that they can be answered ‘yes’, ’no’, and ‘somewhat’ 
or ’sometimes’, allowing for easy scoring and not requiring clinical assessment. Questions reference 
the four weeks and 12 months prior to the interview, allowing for the generation of prevalences for 
different periods. The 12-month prevalence is the primary measure produced by the DISC-IV modules, 
and this aligned with what has been produced from other National Survey of Mental Health and 
Wellbeing initiative surveys. 
DISC-IV modules for seven disorders were included in the survey: 
 
Anxiety disorders: 
- Social phobia; 
- Separation anxiety disorder; 
- Generalised anxiety disorder; and 
- Obsessive-compulsive disorder; 
 
Major depressive disorder; 
 
Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD); and 
 
Conduct disorder. 
In this report, the term mental disorder is used to refer to one or more of the seven disorders assessed 
using the DISC-IV.  
The modules were completed by parents and carers in relation to their children’s symptoms and the 
impact of these over the previous 12 months, which gave 12-month prevalence.

Revision. Washington, DC, American Psychiatric Association, 2000. 
   
 
 
 
The Mental Health of Children and Adolescents 151 
 
Young people aged 11-17 years also completed the Major depressive disorder module in relation to 
their own symptoms and the impact of these in the previous 12 months. Where the prevalence or 
mental disorder status being reported is based on a diagnosis from information provided by young 
people themselves, as opposed to information from their parents and carers, this has been described 
as major depressive disorder based on youth self-report. 
Additional content to assess severity 
The DISC-IV assesses whether a child or adolescent has a particular mental disorder, but does not 
routinely measure the severity of the impact due to that disorder. Seventeen questions were included 
in the survey to assess the level of functional impairment of symptoms of mental disorders. These 
were designed to measure the impact of symptoms of mental disorders on the child or adolescent’s 
functioning at school or work, with friends, with their family and with respect to distress to the child or 
adolescent him or herself.  A graded response model was used to create a composite impact on 
function score. This score was standardised with a range from -3.0 to +3.0 where higher scores 
represent increasing severity of impact on functioning. 
Children and adolescents were classified into three levels of impact on functioning by applying the 
national mental health service planning standard ratio of severity for mental disorders to the 
standardised score (1:2:4 for severe, moderate and mild cases). In addition suicide plans or attempts 
in the past 12 months were considered. The three levels are: 
 
Severe: A positive diagnosis plus an impact score greater than or equal to 1.75 and/or a 
history of suicide attempt in the 12 months prior to interview; 
 
Moderate: A positive diagnosis plus an impact score greater than or equal to 0.95 or a 
history of suicide plans in the 12 months prior to interview; and 
 
Mild: All other cases with a positive diagnosis. 
Other measures of mental health problems 
A variety of mental health problems were assessed as follows: 
 
Oppositional problem behaviours 
 
Oppositional defiant disorder requires some clinical judgement in order to complete the 
diagnosis. This was not possible in the survey. However, oppositional problem behaviours 
were still assessed using the DISC-IV module for oppositional defiant disorder, but no 
formal diagnoses could be established. 
 
Eating disorders 
 
Diagnostic modules for eating disorders were not included in the survey. Instead self-
report Body Mass Index (BMI) was collected and questions were used to assess a broad 
range of behaviours that are indicative of eating-related problem behaviours. 
 
Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) 
 
The SDQ was included in the questionnaires for parents and carers and for young people. 
This measure is routinely used as a tool to assess young people receiving state/territory-
administered specialised child and adolescent mental health services. 
 
The SDQ provides a brief behavioural screening questionnaire comprised of five scales of 
five items each. Items in four of these scales, that is emotional problems, conduct 
 152 The Mental Health of Children and Adolescents 
 
 
problems, hyperactivity and peer problems, are added together to generate a total 
difficulties score. The SDQ was designed so that approximately 10% of children and 
adolescents fall into the ‘abnormal’ range on the total difficulties score, which indicates 
that they are at substantial risk of clinically significant problems. The SDQ also includes an 
impact scale that measures interference in life due to emotional and behavioural problems 
in the domains of home life, friendships, classroom learning and leisure activities. 
 
Kessler 10 Psychological Distress Scale (K10+)  
 
An enhanced version of the K10+ with additional questions on anger, control, 
concentration and feeling calm and peaceful was completed by young people. This is a 
measure of psychological distress that has been shown to be highly correlated with the 
presence of depressive or anxiety disorders. The measure consists of the standard ten 
questions, together with four questions on days out of role and additional questions on 
anger, control, concentration and feeling calm or peaceful. 
 
Scores are classified into four levels of psychological distress — low, moderate, high and 
very high distress. 
 
Self esteem 
 
A set of 13 self-report questions were developed to measure the self-esteem of adolescents. 
 
Bullying 
 
Questions on bullying were adapted from those used in the Cyber Friendly Schools 
Project. These covered its frequency and the level of distress it caused, as well as when the 
young person had been the perpetrator.  
Service use and perceived need for services 
One of the main aims of the survey was to determine the use of services by children and adolescents 
to assist them with any mental health problems they may have.  
The service use module was developed specifically for the survey, and tailored both for use with 
young people and to the current Australian health care environment.  
The term ‘for emotional or behavioural problems’ was used to capture service use for a broader range 
of mental health problems, not just by those with a mental disorder. The term was defined as 
meaning ‘a number of things, for example, being anxious or stressed, feeling depressed, having 
problems concentrating, or being aggressive or hyperactive’. 
Information was collected for the previous 12 months about the following: 
 
health services — any service provided by a qualified health professional regardless of 
where that service was provided (community, hospital inpatient and emergency, and 
private rooms); 
 
school services — any service provided by the school or other educational institution that 
a young person was attending, including individual or group counselling, a special class or 
school, or service provided by a school nurse;  
 
telephone counselling services; and 
 
other online services used for emotional and behavioural problems. 
   
 
 
 
The Mental Health of Children and Adolescents 153 
 
Perceived need for help was assessed in three ways as follows: 
 
Parents and carers were asked if they felt that their children needed any help with 
emotional or behavioural problems. If so, they were then asked whether their needs had 
been fully or partially met by the services they received, or were not met. When needs were 
not fully met information was collected on the barriers to seeking help or receiving more of 
the help they felt their children needed.  
 
Young people were directly asked the same set of questions about their own needs and 
any barriers to them seeking help or receiving more help if they felt they needed it. 
 
Parents and carers were also asked about the services they had received and their need for 
help for themselves and/or other family members to deal with the emotional and 
behavioural problems affecting their children. 
All information on service use and perceived need was collected for the previous 12 months and 
restricted to ‘services for emotional or behavioural problems’. 
5. Data issues 
Response rate 
In total 6,310 parents and carers or 55% of eligible households participated in the survey. In addition 
2,967 or 89% of young people aged 11-17 years for whom their parents or carers had given permission 
completed a questionnaire. 
Based on data from the 2011 Census, about one in four Australian households contain one or more 
children aged 4-17 years. In calculating the response rate for the survey, it is necessary to account for 
the fact that not all households approached in the survey contained children within the sample age 
range. Interviewers approached each selected household at different times. However, there remained 
some households where it was not possible to make contact with anyone living in the household 
despite these attempts. Census data have been used to estimate the proportion of these households 
that would be likely to have contained children aged 4-17 years.  
The survey was voluntary and some households refused to participate. When a householder refused 
to participate in the actual survey, the interviewer tried to obtain some basic demographic 
information, in particular whether there were any children living there. About two thirds of refusing 
householders would not provide this basic information. Again Census data have been used to 
estimate the proportion of these households that would have contained children aged 4-17 years. 
The estimated number of non-contacts and refusals where eligibility could not be determined were 
added to the number of participants and the number of refusals who confirmed they had one or more 
children in order to estimate the overall response rate. Using this method, the overall response rate for 
the survey was estimated to be 55%. It is acknowledged that the inclusion of households where it was 
not possible to make contact makes this a strict, conservative estimate of the overall response rate. If 
this group of households is excluded from the estimate, the overall response rate increases to 60%. 
 154 The Mental Health of Children and Adolescents 
 
 
Sample representativeness 
Several approaches were used to assess how representative the sample was of children and 
adolescents in the Australian population.  
Firstly, the demographic characteristics of children, adolescents and families who participated in the 
survey were compared with those of the total population of Australian families with children aged 
4-17 years. The survey included a number of questions that matched questions in the 2011 Census. 
This enabled a comparison to be made between the survey sample and the Census figures based on 
the age and sex of the child, family structure, parental education, income and employment, housing 
tenure and country of birth of both children and adolescents and their parents and carers. 
Secondly, response rates were calculated for each individual SA1 area. Statistical models were then 
used to test for differences in response rates by characteristics of the area, including the 
Socio-Economic Indexes for each area, remoteness, state and part of state, and a range of census-
derived measures, including proportion of overseas born, proportion of people speaking languages 
other than English, proportion with limited proficiency in English, proportion of sole parent families, 
proportion of families with low household income, highest level of schooling completed, and 
proportion of households living in rented accommodation. 
Finally, the survey included the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), which is used 
internationally to measure mental health problems in children and adolescents. The SDQ is designed 
so that approximately 10% of children and adolescents fall into the ‘abnormal’ range on the total 
difficulties score. Analysis of the data revealed that 10.1% of young people in the second survey did 
so. In addition, the SDQ results on the various scales were compared with those from another national 
survey, the 2004 British Child and Adolescent Mental Health Survey. The distribution of the parent and 
carer reported SDQ scores was found to very closely match those from the British survey. 
Only two of all the factors examined were found to be associated with participation in the survey: 
 
age of the child — participation was higher among families with children under 7 years; and 
 
number of children in the family — participation was higher among families with two or 
more children. 
Survey data were weighted, based on information from the 2011 Census, to account for these patterns 
of participation in the survey.  
The survey sample was representative of the population for all other demographic characteristics 
considered. 
Data validation and coding 
Data were collected for the survey using computer assisted interviewing. This ensures that questions 
were asked in the correct sequence, only valid answers were recorded, and that questions could not 
be inadvertently skipped and no answers recorded. Logic checks were programmed into the 
questionnaire to ensure that logically inconsistent answers could not be recorded. After data 
collection, a data editing phase was undertaken to check for any unusual values indicating possible 
data entry errors. 
   
 
 
 
The Mental Health of Children and Adolescents 155 
 
Participants had the option of answering ‘don’t know’ in some questions and they could refuse to 
answer any question in the survey. These responses were treated differently depending upon the 
section of the survey: 
 
According to the international standard for scoring the DISC-IV, responses recorded as 
‘don’t know’ or ‘refused’ were treated as ‘no’ responses for all of the symptom questions 
within the DISC-IV diagnostic modules.  
 
‘Don’t know’ is not a valid response and refusals are not allowed in response to any 
questions in the SDQ. If following additional prompts no response was given, the answer 
was recorded as the child not having any difficulties in that area. 
 
Responses of ‘don’t know’ and refusals to answer questions dealing with demographic 
and socio-economic measures were recorded as such, but not presented in the tables in 
this publication. 
 
For other questions ‘don’t know’ and ‘refused’ were also treated as ‘no’ responses, except 
when the question was a rating, such as for school performance, or a count, such as the 
number of times a service was used. In these cases ‘don’t know’ and ‘refused’ were treated 
as missing data and excluded from the counts when presenting data in this publication. In 
some cases where the proportion of ‘don’t know’ responses is particularly high, such as with 
parent and carer-reported use of online services for help-seeking, this is noted in the text. 
There was a negligible amount of missing data for most data items in the parent and carer 
questionnaire. The main exception was in relation to household income, which had the largest 
proportion of missing values, with approximately 4% of families either responding ‘don’t know’ or 
refusing to provide their household income. 
There was a negligible amount of missing data for most items in the youth self-report questionnaire, 
particularly as participants were mostly not given an option to respond with ‘don’t know’ or to refuse 
to answer a question. The main exceptions were in relation to the questions on self-harm and suicidal 
behaviours, for which participants were given the option of responding ‘prefer not to say’, and for 
height and weight. Young people who did not provide either their height or weight were excluded 
from analyses relating to Body Mass Index (BMI) and also low weight problem eating behaviour and 
binge eating or purging problem eating behaviour both of which include BMI status as part of the 
definition. There was no evidence that the individual eating behaviours that form part of the definition 
of these problem eating behaviours occurred any more or less frequently in young people who 
reported their height and weight compared with those who did not.  
There were no open questions requiring data entry and no responses required clinical judgement. 
Where cell sizes were less than five, these were suppressed when presenting data in the tables in this 
publication to ensure confidentiality. 
Accuracy of estimates 
Confidence intervals demonstrate the level of accuracy achieved by the survey. A 95% confidence 
interval has been calculated for every estimate included in this publication and only significant 
differences in the results noted in the text. Similarly, when numbers were relatively small and 
apparent differences are more likely to be due to chance alone, this is noted. 
 156 The Mental Health of Children and Adolescents 
 
 
Two age groups, 4-11 years and 12-17 years, were used throughout the report. The prevalence of 
mental disorders in children and adolescents for these two age groups and the 95% confidence 
intervals for these data are presented below (Table A-1).  
Data with the 95% confidence intervals for the prevalence of mental disorders in all children and 
adolescents broken into four age groups are also provided below (Table A-2). These indicate that 
further examination of subgroups or disaggregation for single years of age cannot be undertaken with 
reasonable accuracy.

The Mental Health of Children and Adolescents 157 
 
6. Comparability with 1998 survey 
There are a number of substantive methodological and content differences between the first and 
second child and adolescent national surveys of mental health and wellbeing. 
Diagnoses of mental disorders 
The first survey used modules from the DISC-IV to assess four mental disorders — major depressive 
disorder, dysthymic disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and conduct disorder. These 
were completed by parents and carers.  
There were similarities, but also significant differences in how mental disorders were assessed in the 
second survey. Firstly, the DISC-IV was the primary diagnostic tool for both surveys. Major depressive 
disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and conduct disorder were also assessed in the 
second survey. However, the second survey also assessed four anxiety disorders, namely social 
phobia, separation anxiety, generalised anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Parents and 
carers completed DISC-IV modules for all seven disorders. Therefore direct comparisons of the overall 
12-month prevalence of mental disorders cannot be made. 
In the second survey young people completed the same DISC-IV major depressive disorder module as 
their parents and carers, providing an alternative perspective on whether they had the disorder. 
The DISC-IV eating disorders module was included in the first survey. However, too few cases were 
identified for results to be published. For this reason the module was not included in the second 
survey, but rather problem eating behaviours were assessed using questions drawn from the Avon 
Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. 
Questions were also added to determine the impact of symptoms of particular mental disorders from 
which severity could be determined. This allows for comparison of the prevalence data by severity as 
is possible with the other National Surveys of Mental Health and Wellbeing, but was not possible with 
the first survey. 
Problem behaviours 
In the first survey mental health problems were assessed using three tools: 
 
Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL)2 is a 113 item questionnaire designed to assess the 
emotional and behavioural problems in children and adolescents over the last six months, 
which is completed by parents and carers; 
 
Youth Self-Report, is a 112 item questionnaire, which is derived from the CBCL for 
completion by young people aged 13-17 years; and 
 
the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D)3 is a 20 item self-report 
scale designed to measure depressive symptomatology in the past week.

Psychological Measurement. 1: 385-401, 1977. 
 158 The Mental Health of Children and Adolescents 
 
 
The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) was included in this second survey and the Child 
Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and Youth Self-Report, used in the first survey, were not. There were several 
reasons for this change. The SDQ is substantially shorter than the CBCL for parents or carers to 
complete, while having equivalent measurement properties. This provided leeway for questions on 
other topics to be added to the survey. In addition, the SDQ has been included in a range of other 
collections in Australia, including as a routine measure in the National Outcomes and Casemix 
Collection used by state and territory mental health services and the Longitudinal Study of Australian 
Children. It has also been designated as the best source of information for developing a leading 
national Children’s Headline Indicator for social and emotional wellbeing in children and young 
people by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare.4  
Young people aged 11-17 years also completed the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) 
Youth Self Report in the second survey rather than the Youth Self-Report based on the CBCL, which 
was used in the first survey. 
Depression symptoms, which were collected in the first survey using the CES-D, were covered in more 
detail by the DISC-IV major depressive disorder module, which also provided a diagnosis. 
Service use 
Questions on service use were completely redesigned for the second survey. The approach taken was 
based on that used in the 2007 National Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing of the Australian adult 
population. This approach is based on identifying if services have been used in the past 12 months, if 
parents and carers or young people feel they needed help or support, whether they received the level 
of support they needed, and what barriers may have prevented them from using services they felt they 
needed.  
The first survey asked about services used in the six months prior to the survey. By contrast, the 
reference period in the second survey was 12 months to match the period over which mental 
disorders were assessed using the DISC-IV and also to align with service data from the other National 
Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing initiative surveys, including the 2007 adult survey. Direct 
comparison of service use over these two different timeframes is not possible and data presented on 
services used by young people with mental disorders is also not comparable due to the differences in 
disorders. 
The types of services covered in the second survey were also broader than those asked about in the 
first, reflecting significant changes in the types of services available to young people in 2013-14 
compared with 1998. Questions were added about new health services, online services and 
information, and additional information was collected about services used in schools.  
Scoring algorithms 
There have been minor changes to the scoring algorithms used in the DISC-IV since 1998. The 1998 
survey results for major depressive disorder, ADHD and conduct disorder have been recalculated 
using the latest algorithms to be comparable with the results from this second survey.

Glossary term 
Definition 
12-month prevalence 
12-month prevalence 
Meeting diagnostic criteria according to the DSM-IV (for the purposes of 
this report) in the 12 months prior to interview. Prevalence includes both 
new cases, whose symptoms first developed during the 12 months prior 
to the interview and continuing cases whose symptoms were present 
prior to the 12 months, but persisted, and were at a level to meet the 
diagnostic criteria in the 12 months prior to interview. 
Adolescent self-report 
questionnaire 
Adolescent self-report 
questionnaire 
The questionnaire for completion by young people aged 11 years and 
older. Subject to the permission of their parents or carers, young people 
were asked to complete this in private using a tablet computer. 
The questionnaire comprised the following modules: 
 
DISC-IV major depressive disorder module; 
 
Presence of symptoms of psychosis; 
 
Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ); 
 
Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10+); 
 
Use of services and perceived need for services; 
 
Use of internet; 
 
Youth health-risk behaviours, including self-harm, suicidal 
behaviours, substance use, disordered eating behaviours and 
sexual behaviour 
 
Experience of bullying; 
 
Level of education; and 
 
Level of self-esteem. 
Age criteria were set for some sections of the questionnaire. Questions 
about self-harm and suicidal behaviours were only asked of young people 
aged 12 years and older. Questions about use of services and perceived 
need for services, sexual behaviours, and smoking, alcohol and other 
drugs were asked of young people aged 13 years and older. 
Alcohol consumption 
Alcohol consumption 
Young people aged 13 years and over were asked if they had ever had a 
drink of alcohol other than a few sips, if they had drunk alcohol in the past 
30 days and if they had consumed more than four drinks in a row (that is 
within a couple of hours). 
Anxiety disorders 
Anxiety disorders 
A class of mental disorders defined by the experience of intense and 
debilitating anxiety.  
The types of anxiety disorders covered in the survey were social phobia, 
separation anxiety disorder (SAD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and 
obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).

Definition 
Modules for each of these four anxiety disorders from the DISC-IV were 
completed by parents and carers and their responses used to determine if 
the young person met the diagnostic criteria for an anxiety disorder in the 
12 months prior to interview. 
Anxiety disorders were not included in the first survey in 1998. 
Area of residence 
Area of residence 
Area of residence was categorised as either Greater capital cities or Rest of 
state based on the ABS Greater Capital City Statistical Area (GCCSA) 
classification. This classification represents the functional extent of the 
eight state and territory capital cities in Australia. Households within 
these areas were classified as Greater capital cities. The remainder were 
classed as Rest of state. 
Attention-
deficit/hyperactivity 
disorder (ADHD) 
Attention-
deficit/hyperactivity 
disorder (ADHD) 
Persistent pattern of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity. 
Children and adolescents may find it difficult to pay attention and see 
tasks or activities through to the end or make careless mistakes with 
school work or other tasks. Children and adolescents with problems in 
the area of hyperactivity may talk excessively, have trouble staying still 
when it is appropriate or expected and act like they are ‘always on the go’. 
There are three subtypes of ADHD based on the most common 
symptoms. Those with mostly inattentive symptoms are diagnosed with 
ADHD, predominantly inattentive type and individuals with primarily 
hyperactivity-impulsivity symptoms are diagnosed with ADHD, 
predominantly hyperactive-impulsive type. Those children and 
adolescents with symptoms of both inattentiveness and hyperactivity are 
diagnosed with ADHD, combined type. 
To meet DSM-IV criteria symptoms must be more frequent and severe 
than in other individuals at a similar developmental stage, persist for at 
least six months and some impairment from the symptoms must be 
present in two or more settings (e.g. at school and at home).  
The module for ADHD from the DISC-IV was completed by parents and 
carers and their responses used to determine if the young person met the 
DSM-IV criteria for ADHD in the 12 months prior to interview. 
Binge eating and  
purging problem  
eating behaviour 
Binge eating and  
purging problem  
eating behaviour 
Both binge eating and either vomiting or taking laxatives to control 
weight in adolescents with a Body Mass Index (BMI) that was not in the 
underweight range. 
Bullying 
Bullying 
When people tease, threaten, spread rumours about, hit, shove, or hurt 
other people over and over again.

Carer 
Carer 
The primary carer was the individual in the household who knew the most 
about the child selected for interview in the survey. In a majority of cases 
this was the mother of the survey child. If a biological, adoptive or foster 
parent of the child was the primary carer and another biological, adoptive 
or foster parent of the child was present in the household, this person was 
designated as the secondary carer. Otherwise, if there was another person 
present in the household who was also responsible for caring for the 
study child, they were recorded as the secondary carer. 
Comorbidity 
Comorbidity 
Occurrence of more than one mental disorder within the same period.  
For the purposes of the survey this was defined as more than one of the 
disorders (an anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder, ADHD and 
conduct disorder) in the 12 months prior to interview. 
Conduct disorder 
Conduct disorder 
Repetitive and persistent behaviour to a degree that violates the basic 
rights of others, major societal norms or rules in terms of aggression 
towards people or animals, destruction of property, deceitfulness or theft, 
and serious violation of rules. Young people with conduct disorder exhibit 
a range of behaviours often including bullying, frequent physical fights, 
deliberately destroying other’s property, breaking into properties or cars, 
staying out late at night without permission, running away from home or 
frequent truancy from school. 
The DSM-IV criteria specify that at least three or more of these behaviours 
must have been present in the past 12 months, with at least one in the 
past 6 months. These behaviours must also cause clinically significant 
impairment in social, academic or occupational functioning. 
The module for conduct disorders from the DISC-IV was completed by 
parents and carers and their responses used to determine if the young 
person met the DSM-IV criteria for conduct disorder in the 12 months 
prior to interview. 
Cyber bullying 
Cyber bullying 
When people use mobile phones or the internet to send nasty or 
threatening emails or messages, post mean or nasty comments or 
pictures on websites like Facebook, or have someone pretend to be them 
online to hurt other people over and over again.

Days absent from 
school 
Number of days the study child was absent from school for any reason. 
Average days absent from school due to symptoms of mental disorder 
have been reported. Parents and carers were asked how many days their 
child had been absent from school in the past 12 months specifically due 
to the symptoms of each of the disorders that they reported symptoms. 
Averages were then calculated from all children and adolescents who met 
diagnostic criteria for the mental disorder, including those who did not 
miss any days of school due to their symptoms.

Modules for seven disorders were used in the survey — social phobia, 
separation anxiety disorder, generalised anxiety disorder, obsessive-
compulsive disorder, major depressive disorder, Attention-
Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and conduct disorder. 
Drug use 
Drug use 
The survey asked whether young people aged 13 years and older had ever 
used cannabis or marijuana, whether they had used cannabis or 
marijuana in the last 30 days, and whether they had used other drugs. 
These included using prescription drugs for non-medical purposes; 
ecstasy; amphetamines and methamphetamines; cocaine; hallucinogens 
such as LSD; inhalants such as petrol, glue, aerosols, paint, solvents or 
nitrous; heroin; steroids; GHB or ketamine. 
Family functioning 
Family functioning 
A shortened version of the General Functioning Subscale of the McMaster 
Family Assessment Device was used to classify families into four levels of 
functioning.1 This ranged from very good through to poor, with poor 
indicating unhealthy family functioning likely to require clinical 
intervention. Of all families in the survey 3.7% had a poor level of family 
functioning.

Definition 
Family type 
Family type 
Families were classified into families with two parents or carers and 
families with one parent or carer. Families with two parents or carers were 
further categorised into original, step, blended or other families 
corresponding to the Australian Bureau of Statistics family blending 
classification variable introduced in the 2006 Census. These are defined 
as follows: 
- 
Original families contain at least one child who is the natural, 
adopted or foster child of both partners in the couple and no step 
children. 
The Australian Bureau of Statistics refers to this category as 
‘intact families’. 
- 
Step families have at least one resident step child, but no child 
who is the natural or adopted child of both partners. 
- 
Blended families have two or more children; at least one child 
who is the natural or adopted child of both parents, and at least 
one who is the step child of one of them. 
- 
Other families have no children who are the natural, adopted, 
foster or step child of either parent or carer. These include 
families with children being raised by their grandparents or other 
relatives. 
Generalised anxiety 
disorder 
Generalised anxiety 
disorder 
An anxiety disorder characterised by excessive anxiety, worry or 
apprehension about a number of different events or activities. 
To meet DSM-IV criteria, symptoms must occur more days than not for a 
period of at least six months. The constant worry causes distress to the 
individual. The child or adolescent has difficulty controlling the worry, 
and experiences impairment in social, academic or other important areas 
of functioning. 
The module for generalised anxiety disorder from the DISC-IV was 
completed by parents and carers and their responses used to determine if 
the young person met the DSM-IV criteria for generalised anxiety disorder 
in the 12 months prior to interview.

fatigue and loss of energy, feelings of worthlessness and inability to 
concentrate. 
The DSM-IV criteria specify that at least five symptoms of depression must 
be present for a minimum of a two-week period, that these symptoms 
cause clinically significant distress to the child or adolescent and that 
they must interfere with the child or adolescent’s normal functioning at 
school, at home or in social settings.  
The module for major depressive disorder from the DISC-IV was 
completed by parents and carers and their responses used to determine if 
the young person met the DSM-IV criteria for major depressive disorder in 
the 12 months prior to interview.

Mental disorder 
Mental disorder 
Defined according to the detailed diagnostic criteria within classification 
systems. This covers: 
- 
the nature, number and combination of symptoms; 
- 
a time period over which the symptoms have been continuously 
experienced;  
- 
the level of distress or impairment experienced; and  
- 
circumstances for exclusion of a diagnosis, such as it being due 
to a general medical condition or the symptoms being 
associated with another mental disorder.  
The classification system used for mental disorders in this report was the 
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition 
(DSM-IV). 
Not in employment 
Not in employment 
Both unemployed and not in the labour force. 
Obsessive-compulsive 
disorder 
Obsessive-compulsive 
disorder 
An anxiety disorder characterised by recurrent obsessions or 
compulsions. 
Obsessions are persistent ideas, thoughts, impulses or images that are 
intrusive and difficult to control and that cause anxiety or distress. 
Common obsessions include worrying about things being dirty or having 
germs, or that the person might do something bad in public. 
Compulsions are repetitive behaviours, such as washing hands or 
changing clothes over and over, repetitively checking things, or counting 
or ordering things over and over. 
To meet DSM-IV criteria, the compulsions and obsessions must be severe 
enough to be time consuming and cause marked distress or significant 
impairment.  
The module for obsessive-compulsive disorder from the DISC-IV was 
completed by parents and carers and their responses used to determine if 
the young person met the DSM-IV criteria for obsessive compulsive 
disorder in the 12 months prior to interview.

Oppositional problem 
behaviours 
Oppositional problem 
behaviours 
Negativistic, hostile and defiant behaviours, such as often losing temper, 
arguing with adults, actively defying adults’ requests and rules, being 
angry, resentful, spiteful or vindictive, lasting at least six months.  
The DISC-IV module for oppositional defiant disorder was included in the 
survey. However, unlike other disorders, the diagnosis for oppositional 
defiant disorder includes an element of clinical judgement that could not 
be implemented within the DISC-IV questions. In particular, for each 
symptom assessed in oppositional defiant disorder the DSM-IV specifies 
that the symptom criterion is met only if the behaviour occurs more 
frequently than is typically observed in individuals of comparable age and 
developmental level. A clinician is required to make this judgement. The 
data collection for Young Minds Matter was undertaken by lay professional 
interviewers who were not specifically trained in psychology or psychiatry 
and expert clinical review of each child or adolescent in the survey was 
not undertaken. As such it was not possible to identify all criteria for 
assigning the diagnosis of oppositional defiant disorder. Instead these 
behaviours are referred to as oppositional problem behaviours to 
distinguish them from the diagnostic condition of oppositional defiant 
disorder.  
In this survey an exclusion criterion was defined so that children or 
adolescents who met the diagnostic criteria for conduct disorder were 
not considered to have oppositional problem behaviours. 
Perceived need for 
mental health care 
Perceived need for 
mental health care 
Extent to which people feel their need for mental health care has been 
met. The need for care was assessed across four types of help: 
- 
Information about emotional or behavioural problems, 
treatment and available services; 
- 
Prescribed medication for emotional or behavioural problems; 
- 
Counselling or a talking therapy about problems or difficulties 
(either one-on-one, as a family or in a group); and 
- 
Courses or other counselling for life skills, self-esteem or 
motivation. 
This was measured in the survey by a separate module that determined 
whether the child or adolescent had any need for help with emotional or 
behavioural problems and whether that need was met. Both parents or 
carers and adolescents were asked the same questions.  
For each of the four types of help, the level of perceived need was 
classified as being either fully met, partially met, unmet or not needed. 
For those reporting a need for more than one type of help, perceived need 
for any type of help was based on a composite of the individual ratings for

each type of help needed. Need for any type of help was rated as being 
fully met if for each type of help needed, that need was assessed as being 
fully met. Need for any type of help was partially met if any of the types of 
help were partially met or if there were combined ratings of fully met and 
unmet need. Need for any type of help was unmet if the level of need for 
all types of help needed was unmet.2 
Problem eating 
behaviours 
Problem eating 
behaviours 
The survey did not assess DSM-IV criteria for eating disorders. Instead, the 
survey sought to identify eating behaviours that may be on the pathway 
to eating disorders. These were eating behaviours associated with low 
weight, and binge eating and purging.  
Questions were taken from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and 
Children to assess a range of activities young people may undertake to 
control their weight in the past 12 months. These were: 
i)  
if they had gone on a diet to lose weight or keep from gaining 
weight; 
ii) 
if there was a time when they had regularly exercised instead of 
doing other things that they were supposed to be doing, or 
while they were injured, in order to lose weight or to avoid 
gaining any weight; 
iii) 
how often they had fasted for at least a day to lose weight or to 
avoid gaining any weight; 
iv) 
how often they had made themselves throw up or vomit to lose 
weight or to avoid gaining any weight; 
v) 
how often they had taken laxatives or other tablets or medicines 
(diet pills or water tablets) to lose weight or to avoid gaining any 
weight; and 
vi) 
how often they had been on an eating binge (defined as eating 
so much food that it would be like eating two or more entire 
meals in one sitting, or eating so much of one particular food, 
like lollies or ice cream, that it would make most people feel 
sick). 
Young people also self-reported their height and weight, and this was 
used to assess their Body Mass Index (BMI). BMI ranges specifically 
designed for children and adolescents were used to classify underweight

and overweight status.3 
Young people were considered to have low-weight problem eating 
behaviour if their BMI was in the underweight range and they dieted, 
fasted, vomited or used laxatives to lose weight or regularly exercised 
when they were supposed to be doing other things. 
 
Young people were considered to have binge eating and purging problem 
eating behaviour if their BMI was not in the underweight range and they 
reported both binge eating and either vomiting or taking laxatives to 
control weight. 
Approximately 8% of young people did not provide either their height or 
weight. These young people were excluded from the calculations of BMI 
and low weight problem eating behaviour and binge eating and purging 
problem eating behaviour. 
Problem internet or 
electronic gaming 
behaviours 
Problem internet or 
electronic gaming 
behaviours 
Young people were asked about five specific behaviours that may be 
indicative of addiction to the internet, social media or electronic gaming: 
i) 
going without eating or sleeping in order to be on the internet or 
play electronic games 
ii)  
feeling bothered or upset if they are unable to be on the internet 
or gaming 
iii) 
catching themselves surfing the internet or playing games even 
when they are not interested 
iv) 
spending less time than they should with family or friends or 
doing school work or work because of the time they spend on 
the internet or gaming 
v) 
having tried unsuccessfully to reduce the time spent on the 
internet or playing electronic games. 
Problem internet or electronic gaming behaviour has been defined as 
reporting four or five of these individual indicators. 
Psychological distress 
Psychological distress 
Measured by the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10), a widely used 
scale designed to detect the differing levels of psychological distress in 
the general population. While high levels of distress are often associated 
with mental illness, it is not uncommon for some people to experience 
psychological distress, but not meet criteria for a mental disorder.

The K10 is based on 10 questions about negative emotional states in the 
four weeks prior to interview. The K10 is scored from 0 to 40, with higher 
scores indicating higher levels of distress. In this report, scores are 
categorised as follows: 
- 
0-5 
Low levels of psychological distress; 
- 
6-11 
Moderate levels of psychological distress; 
- 
12-19 
High levels of psychological distress; and 
- 
20-40 
Very high levels of psychological distress. 
In this survey the K10 scale was administered to primary carers about 
themselves, and was also included in the adolescent self-report 
questionnaire. 
Adolescents completed an enhanced version of the K10+ with additional 
questions on anger, control, concentration and feeling calm and peaceful. 
The K10+ also includes questions about whether as a result of any 
reported distress they had any days when they could not carry out their 
normal activities. 
School services 
School services 
Individual counselling, group counselling or support program, special 
class or school, school nurse or other services received from the school or 
other educational institution that the child or adolescent attends. 
Self-harm 
Self-harm 
Deliberately hurting or injuring yourself without trying to end your life.  
Young people aged 12 years and older were asked if they had ever done 
something to cause themselves harm or injury without trying to end their 
life. They were also given the option of not responding and were not 
asked any further questions about self-harm. 
Separation anxiety 
disorder 
Separation anxiety 
disorder 
An anxiety disorder characterised by excessive anxiety concerning 
separation from the home or from those to whom the child is attached. 
To meet DSM-IV criteria, the anxiety must be beyond that which is 
expected for the child or adolescent’s developmental level, and cause 
significant distress in social, academic or other important areas of 
functioning for at least four weeks.  
The module for separation anxiety disorder from the DISC-IV was 
completed by parents and carers and their responses used to determine if 
the young person met the DSM-IV criteria for separation anxiety disorder 
in the 12 months prior to interview.

Severity of impact on 
functioning 
Severity of impact on 
functioning 
A total of 17 items was administered to respondents to assess the impact 
of disorder symptoms on the child or adolescent’s functioning at school 
or work, with friends, with their family and with respect to distress to the 
child or adolescent him or herself. A graded response model was used to 
create a composite impact on function score. This score was 
standardised with a range from -3.0 to +3.0 where higher scores represent 
increasing severity of impact on functioning. 
Children and adolescents were classified into three levels of impact on 
functioning by applying the national mental health service planning 
standard ratio of severity for mental disorders to the standardised score 
(1:2:4 for severe, moderate and mild cases). In addition suicide plans or 
attempts in the past 12 months were considered. The three levels are: 
- 
Severe: A positive diagnosis plus an impact score greater than or 
equal to 1.75 and/or a history of suicide attempt in the 12 months 
prior to interview; 
- 
Moderate: A positive diagnosis plus an impact score greater than 
or equal to 0.95 or a history of suicide plans in the 12 months 
prior to interview; and 
- 
Mild: All other cases with a positive diagnosis. 
To ease interpretation, throughout this publication, the terms “severity of 
impact on function”, “severity of impact”, and “severity of disorder” have 
been used interchangeably. 
Smoking status 
Smoking status 
Young people aged 13 years and over were asked if they had ever smoked, 
and if they smoked in the past 30 days.  
Young people were only asked if they had smoked in the past 30 days if 
they said yes to the question ‘was there ever a time in your life when you 
were smoking at least once per week?’ As such, smoking data are not 
directly comparable to those from other surveys.

Social phobia 
Social phobia 
An anxiety disorder characterised by a strong fear of social interaction or 
performance situations. People with social phobia avoid social situations 
in case of embarrassment or humiliation.  
To meet DSM-IV criteria symptoms must be present for at least six months 
and the fear or avoidance of social situations must interfere significantly 
with the child or adolescent’s normal routine, academic functioning, or 
social activities or relationships, or they must experience marked distress 
about the phobia. 
The module for social phobia from the DISC-IV was completed by parents 
and carers and their responses used to determine if the young person met 
the DSM-IV criteria for social phobia in the 12 months prior to interview. 
Sub-threshold level 
Sub-threshold level 
Sub-threshold level on the DISC-IV refers to when the symptoms reported 
for any mental disorder were sufficient in number to warrant further 
questioning about the impact of these, but which were not sufficient in 
number, with sufficient impact, or of sufficient duration to meet the DSM-
IV diagnostic criteria for the mental disorder. 
Suicidal behaviours 
 
Suicidal behaviours 
 
Suicidal ideation (serious thoughts about taking one’s own life), making 
suicide plans and suicide attempts where the self-injury is intended to 
end in death. 
Young people aged 12 years and over were asked if during the past 12 
months they had seriously considered attempting suicide. Young people 
were also given the option of not answering and were then not asked any 
further questions about suicidal behaviours.
