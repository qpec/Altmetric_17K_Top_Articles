BACKGROUND: Knowledge about expected recovery after
hip fracture is essential to help patients and families set
realistic expectations and plan for the future.
OBJECTIVES: To determine rates of functional recovery
in older adults who sustained a hip fracture based on
one’s previous function.
DESIGN: Observational study.
PARTICIPANTS: We identified subjects who sustained
a hip fracture while enrolled in the nationally repre-
sentative Health and Retirement Study (HRS) using
linked Medicare claims. HRS interviews subjects every
2 years. Using information from interviews collected
during the interview preceding the fracture and the
first interview 6 or more months after the fracture,
we determined the proportion of subjects who
returned to pre-fracture function.
MAIN MEASURES: Functional outcomes of interest
were: (1) ADL dependency, (2) mobility, and (3) stair-
climbing ability. We examined baseline characteristics
associated with a return to: (1) ADL independence, (2)
walking one block, and (3) climbing a flight of stairs.
KEY RESULTS: A total of 733 HRS subjects ≥65 years of
age sustained a hip fracture (mean age 84 ± 7 years, 77 %
female). Thirty-one percent returned to pre-fracture ADL
function, 34 % to pre-fracture mobility function, and 41 %
to pre-fracture climbing function. Among those who were
ADL independent prior to fracture, 36 % returned to in-
dependence, 27 % survived but needed ADL assistance,
and 37 % died. Return to ADL independence was less
likely for those ≥85 years old (26 % vs. 44 %), with de-
mentia (8 % vs. 39 %), and with a Charlson comorbidity
score >2 (23 % vs. 44 %). Results were similar for those
able to walk a block and for those able to climb a flight of
stairs prior to fracture.
CONCLUSIONS: Recovery rates are low, even among
those with higher levels of pre-fracture functional status,
and are worse for patients who are older, cognitively im-
paired, and who have multiple comorbidities.

INTRODUCTION
Hip fracture is a public health problem worldwide with the
annual incidence estimated to reach 2.6 million in the year
2025 and is associated with excessive mortality.1 In 2010,
289,000 hospitalizations in the US were for hip fracture in
older adults. The vast majority of older adults who sustain a
hip fracture undergo surgical intervention with post-surgical
care pathways focused on rehabilitating patients to their
premorbid level of function. Rehabilitative efforts to return
the older adult to their pre-fracture function have, therefore,
been the predominant goal of research agendas and interven-
tions over the past decades.2–4
While hip fracture management has been traditionally fo-
cused on curative and rehabilitation models of care in which
the focus is on restoring patients to independent function, this
model may not meet the needs of patients and families if the
actual functional outcomes experienced by patients with hip
fracture are less positive. Many patients with hip fracture are
developing increasing levels of frailty and functional depen-
dence even before the hip fracture, and the likelihood of
returning to their previous level of function may be low in
these patients.5 Indeed, studies of hip fracture patients in the
northeast region of the US have shown a 14–54 % rate of
recovery.6–8 However, few utilized population-based cohorts
with access to pre-fracture functional status data. Identifying
patients who are unlikely to return to their prior level of
functioning may be useful in targeting patients in whom a
supportive care approach, with anticipatory guidance, would
complement the traditional rehabilitative care plan.
In order to determine the proportion of older adults who
return to their prior level of function after sustaining a hip
fracture, we compared and pre- and post-fracture function
among those who sustained hip fracture while enrolled in
the Health and Retirement Study (HRS). The HRS is a

 cohort representative of the older US population. We first
compared pre- and post-fracture function for activities of
daily living (ADL), walking, and stair climbing and then
assessed which baseline patient demographic and clinical
factors predicted particularly low or high likelihood for
recovery.
METHODS
Subjects
The HRS is a longitudinal study that measures changes in
the health and economic circumstances of Americans as
they age and is nationally representative of persons over
the age of 50. It was initiated in 1992, with new subjects
periodically recruited to remain representative of the US
population. HRS interviews are conducted by phone or
face to face (response rate >80 %) every 2 years. If an
individual is unable to complete an interview because of
physical or cognitive impairment, the interview is con-
ducted with a proxy respondent, generally a family
member.
We identified hip fracture cases in HRS subjects aged
65 and older by linking the HRS survey data to Medicare
claims. We used Fisher’s hip fracture algorithm to identify
individuals with hip fracture.9 An individual was identi-
fied as having a hip fracture if one of the following two
conditions was met: (1) the individual was admitted to a
hospital with an admitting diagnosis ICD-9 code for hip
fracture “820.xx” or (2) a surgeon’s charge for operative
hip fracture repair (CPT code 27230–27248) supported
with either (a) a second surgeon’s charge within 2 days
or (b) a supporting ICD-9 procedure code for hip fracture
surgery (ICD-9 785.5, 790.5, 791.5, 792.5, 793.5).9 We
excluded admissions that were considered late effects
from a prior hip fracture (ICD9 733.81, 733.82, 905.3,
V540-V549) as done in previous studies.9–11
Out of 25,146 HRS subjects age 65 or older between
1992 and 2010, 19,006 (76 %) agreed to have their HRS
surveys linked to the Medicare claims. We identified
1,124 hip fractures among those subjects. Since we used
Medicare claims to identify comorbidities prior to the hip
fracture event, we excluded hip fractures that were not
preceded by one continuous year of Medicare fee-for-
service enrollment. Of the remaining 1,017 hip fractures,
189 (19 %) subjects had no HRS interview within
2.5 years before or after the hip fracture event and were
excluded. A 2.5 years’ timeframe was used because of the
uneven timing between the biennial interviews. Subjects
that died within 2.5 years after hip fracture were included
despite not having an HRS interview after the hip fracture
event. Since considerable recovery still occurs during the
6 months after the hip fracture,6 we excluded 94 inter-
views that occurred within this time frame. The resulting
cohort included 733 HRS subjects with hip fracture.
Measures
The primary outcomes were functional recovery after hip
fracture in (1) activities of daily living (ADLs), (2) mobility,
and (3) stair climbing. ADLs are measured by the number of
activities of daily living (i.e., bathing, dressing, eating,
toileting, transferring) in which subjects needed assistance.
Mobility is measured with three levels of difficulty: no diffi-
culty with walking one block, difficulty walking one block but
no difficulty walking across the room, or difficulty walking
across the room. Stair climbing is measured as a dichotomous
variable: no difficulty with climbing one flight of stairs with-
out resting or difficulty climbing a flight of stairs without
resting. Representative sample questions are included in Ap-
pendix 1.
For each outcome, we defined functional recovery as sur-
vival with a return to pre-hip fracture function, which we term
as a subject’s “baseline function.” To determine the baseline
function of each measure, we used the HRS interview obtained
preceding the hip fracture, with a maximum window of
2.5 years (mean = 11.6 ± 7.4 months). The time frame of
2.5 years is to account for the slightly uneven spacing of
interviews across interview waves. To assess post-fracture
function, we used the first interview obtained between
6 months and 2.5 years after hip fracture (mean = 12.5 ±
8.1 months). Pre- and post-fracture function used function
data provided by proxy respondents when the subjects could
not be interviewed (20.9 %). Returning to baseline function
was determined by comparing the pre- and post-fracture sur-
vey data and was treated as a dichotomous variable.
The HRS interview data were used to characterize the
sample in terms of self-reported age, gender, race or ethnicity
(e.g. non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, and
other), education, wealth, income, marital status, and nursing
home residence. We determined a history of dementia and a
Charlson comorbidity score for each subject using Medicare
claims.12 Dementia was evaluated independent of the
Charlson comorbidity score a priori given previous studies
suggesting poor outcomes in hip fracture patients with demen-
tia.13,14 We also used the Lee Index, a validated prognostic
index for 4-year mortality in older adults where a score of 13 is
associated with 59 % risk of death within 4 years.15 Mortality
after hip fracture was determined using National Death Index-
linked data.
Statistical Analysis
First, we analyzed the outcomes for each baseline function
stratum. We calculated the proportion of subjects who: (1)
returned to their pre-fracture function, (2) survived but did
not recover to their pre-fracture function, or (3) died, as
described above.
Next, we calculated the probability of survival with return
to a high level of function. We examined the probability of
subjects who were ADL-independent returning to ADL inde-
pendence, the probability of subjects who had no difficulty

 walking a block returning to having no difficulty walking a
block, and the probability of subjects who had no difficulty
climbing a flight of stairs returning to having no difficulty
climbing a flight of stairs. We used logistic regression models
to estimate these probabilities across a variety of subgroups
defined by clinical and demographic characteristics after
adjusting for age and gender. For example, to compare the
probability of recovery in subjects with and without dementia,
we first fitted a logistic regression model in which the outcome
was ADL independence and the predictor variables were
dementia (yes/no), age, and gender. Then, using the same
distribution of age and gender as in the overall sample, we
used this model to calculate the probability of recovery when
dementia was set to 1 (present) and when dementia was set to 0
(absent).
All analyses were weighted to account for the differential
probability of subject selection and the complex design of the
HRS. Statistical analyses were performed using Stata soft-
ware, version 12 (StataCorp, College Station, TX) and SAS
software, version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). The institu-
tional review board at the University of California, San
Francisco, approved this study.
RESULTS
Table 1 presents descriptive information of the 733 subjects
with hip fracture. At the time of their hip fracture, the average
age of the subjects was 84 ± 7.3 years. Most were female
(77 %), almost half had a high comorbidity burden (Charlson
>2, 44 %), 38 % had a Lee Index ≥13, and 17 % had a
dementia diagnosis. Prior to the hip fracture event, 74 % were
independent in their ADLs, 58 % had no difficulty walking
one block, and 49 % had no difficulty climbing one flight of
stairs without resting.
Rates of returning to baseline ADL, mobility, and climbing
function following hip fracture are shown in Fig. 1. Of all
subjects, 31 % returned to their prior ADL function, 34 %
returned to their prior mobility function, and 41 % returned to
their prior climbing ability. Even for subjects with the highest
level of function at baseline, recovery rates were low at least
6 months after their hip fracture: 36 % were ADL independent,
32 % had no difficulty walking one block, and 29 % had no
difficulty climbing one flight of stairs without resting. About
one-third of the subjects with the highest level of function at
baseline survived but sustained a functional decline after their
hip fracture: 27 % with new ADL dependency, 33 % with new
mobility difficulty, and 34 % with new difficulty stair climbing
without resting.
Table 2 shows the probability of returning to function
among persons who were in the highest level of baseline
function for each measure, adjusting for age and gender. The
factors that were consistently associated with low rates of
functional recovery across all three measures were advanced
age, dementia, and high comorbidity (Charlson score >2).
Lastly, we found no association among race, marital status,
wealth, and income prior to fracture with any of the outcomes.
However, less than high school education was associated with
a lower probability of returning to ADL independence and
with being able to walk one block. In addition, male gender
was associated with a lower probability of returning to ADL

DISCUSSION
Functional recovery in older adults who sustained a hip fracture
ranged from 31 to 41 % across our functional outcomes. We
found that many older adults who sustained a hip fracture were
dependent in ADL, limited in mobility, and limited in stair
climbing even before the hip fracture event. Further, the likelihood
of recovery to the pre-fracture level of function was less than 50 %
regardless of one’s previous level offunction. Among those with a
high baseline function (e.g., ADL independent, no difficulty with
walking a block, or no difficulty climbing a flight of stairs without
resting), approximately one-third returned to their prior level of
functioning. The likelihood of returning to this high level of
function was particularly low in those who were older than age
85, had multiple comorbid conditions, or had dementia.
This study has identified a group of older adults who have a
low probability of recovery to their pre-fracture function. With
the use of prospectively collected, pre-fracture functional data,
this population-based study extends the findings of previous
regional studies. In a regional study published in 1990 evaluat-
ing functional recovery after a hip fracture, 40 % returned to
ADL independence and 54 % returned to walking independent-
ly post-hip fracture.6 In a recent meta-analysis assessing func-
tion 1 year after hip fracture in older adults, 42 % did not return
to their pre-fracture mobility, 35 % were unable to walk inde-
pendently as a result of the fracture, and 14 % of older adults
who sustained a hip fracture were no longer able to climb
stairs.16 Our findings suggest a distinctly lower recovery rate
than these previous studies, further emphasizing that a large
number of hip fracture patients will suffer long-term functional
disability. As compared to prior studies, our study cohort was
older, included those with dementia, had a greater prevalence of
nursing home patients, and had self-reported pre-fracture func-
tional status data.17 Since our subjects were part of a population-
based study, the greater risk of subjects in our study likely more
accurately represents the advanced age and severe morbidity of
patients who have hip fracture.
Rehabilitative care and a focus on returning to function have
been traditional priorities of hip fracture care. However, our

 findings of low functional recovery rates, regardless of baseline
function, emphasize the need to prepare patients and families
with the realistic expectations that recovery may not occur.
Furthermore, we determined that age, dementia, and comorbid-
ity burden were associated with a lower likelihood of recovery
across the spectrum of pre-fracture function. Our study supports
the need for frank discussions with the patient and family about
survival prognosis and likelihood of functional recovery. As-
certainment of the patient’s values and goals of care, also termed
“advance care planning,” is critical at this juncture in order to
optimize quality of life and assist in future medical decision
making. In addition, comprehensive interdisciplinary support-
ive care particularly focused on psychosocial support and phys-
ical supportive home care is appropriate for a large proportion
of patients.
Over the past decade, hip fracture co-management models
have been developed, shown to improve patient care, and
subsequently adopted by some hospitals.18,19 In the co-
management model, a geriatrician ensures appropriate
medical treatments are undertaken and discusses prog-
nosis; thus, patient and family members develop proper
expectations of post-hip fracture recovery and needs.
While this model has improved in-hospital post-fracture
care, little is known about additional supportive needs
by patients and families once the patient returns home.
Additional research is needed to better understand the
experiences, preferences, and needs of these patients and
family members to successfully transition from skilled
nursing facilities to home.
Our study design has several strengths. Two main strengths
include: (1) the use of a population-based study to identify a
representative sample of older adults with hip fracture and (2) the
availability of functional status assessments before a hip fracture,
thereby not subjected to recall bias. The interpretation of our
findings must also take into account several limitations. First, we
leveraged an ongoing study to collect data on physical function
before and after hip fracture, and, as a result, pre-post functional
assessments in both time periods occurred over a 2-year period.
Our other work with the HRS hip fracture cohort subjects that
persons with hip fracture may start declining in function 9 months
before hip fracture.5 Therefore, the definition of functional recov-
ery we use in this study may encompass both the functional loss
that happened after the fracture and the functional deterioration
that led up to the hip fracture. In addition, the validity of using
administrative codes for defining a history of dementia has been
variable in the literature, though specificity tends to be high for
those cases identified.20 Also, the functional classification used in
this study was patient self-reported and is not based on a validated

 measurement; however, the questions asked reflect what might
be asked in a clinical setting (Appendix 1). Lastly, it is possible
some of the negative outcomes observed in our paper would have
been mitigated by better quality of care, such as the type of care
provided by orthogeriatrics units, which are more common in
Europe than the US.21
In conclusion, we found that older adults who sustain a hip
fracture have low rates of returning to pre-fracture function,
regardless of their previous physical function. Also, for patients
with a high level of pre-fracture function, the likelihood of
functional recovery is higher among those without dementia
and with a low comorbidity burden. Given the low likelihood
of older adults returning to their previous levels of physical
function, usual rehabilitation care models should consider inte-
gration of supportive care services to meet the needs of older
adults and caregivers.
