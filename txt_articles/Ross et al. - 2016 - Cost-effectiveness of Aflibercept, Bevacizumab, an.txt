IMPORTANCE Anti–vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) medicines have revolutionized
diabetic macular edema (DME) treatment. A recent randomized clinical trial comparing
anti-VEGF agents for patients with decreased vision from DME found that at 1 year aflibercept
(2.0 mg) achieved better visual outcomes than repackaged (compounded) bevacizumab
(1.25 mg) or ranibizumab (0.3 mg); the worse the starting vision, the greater the treatment
benefit with aflibercept. However, aflibercept and ranibizumab, respectively, are
approximately 31 and 20 times more expensive than bevacizumab.
OBJECTIVE To examine the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of aflibercept,
bevacizumab, and ranibizumab for the treatment of DME.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Post hoc analysis of efficacy, safety, and resource
utilization data at 1-year follow-up from the Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network
Comparative Effectiveness Trial. Patients were enrolled from August 22, 2012, through
August 28, 2013, and analysis was performed from August 21, 2014, through November 7,
2015.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The ICERs for all trial participants and subgroups with
baseline vision of approximate Snellen equivalent 20/32 to 20/40 (better vision) and baseline
vision of approximate Snellen equivalent 20/50 or worse (worse vision). One-year trial data
were used to calculate cost-effectiveness for 1 year for the 3 anti-VEGF agents; mathematical
modeling was then used to project 10-year cost-effectiveness results.
RESULTS The study included 624 participants (mean [SD] age, 60.6 [10.5] years; 45.7%
female; 65.5% white), 209 in the aflibercept group, 207 in the bevacizumab group, and 208
in the ranibizumab group. For all participants, during 1 year, the ICERs of aflibercept and
ranibizumab compared with bevacizumab were $1 110 000 per quality-adjusted life-year
(QALY) and $1 730 000 per QALY, respectively. During 10 years, they were $349 000 per
QALY and $603 000 per QALY, respectively. Compared with ranibizumab, aflibercept’s ICER
was $648 000 per QALY at 1 year and $203 000 per QALY at 10 years. For the subgroup with
worse baseline vision, the 10-year ICERs of aflibercept and ranibizumab compared with
bevacizumab were $287 000 per QALY and $817 000 per QALY, respectively. In eyes with
decreased vision from DME, treatment costs of aflibercept and ranibizumab would need to
decrease by 69% and 80%, respectively, to reach a cost-effectiveness threshold of
$100 000 per QALY compared with bevacizumab during a 10-year horizon; for the subgroup
with worse baseline vision, the costs would need to decrease by 62% and 84%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Aflibercept (2.0 mg) and ranibizumab (0.3 mg) are not
cost-effective relative to bevacizumab for treatment of DME unless their prices decrease
substantially. These results highlight the challenges that physicians, patients, and policymakers
face when safety and efficacy results are at odds with cost-effectiveness results.

A
recent Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Net-
work (DRCR.net) comparative effectiveness trial found
that for patients with diabetic macular edema (DME)
andapproximateSnellenequivalentbaselinevisualacuity(VA)
of 20/50 or worse aflibercept produced greater mean VA gains
at 1 year than bevacizumab or ranibizumab. In contrast, no dif-
ference in mean VA improvement was identified for patients
with baseline VAs of 20/32 to 20/40.1
These agents also vary substantially in cost. On the basis of
2015 wholesale acquisition costs, aflibercept (2.0 mg) costs

Methods
Overview
Inaposthocanalysis,datafromarandomizedclinicaltrialwere
used to calculate clinical benefit, costs, and cost-effectiveness
ofaflibercept,bevacizumab,andranibizumabforDME.1Withthe
use of published cost and quality-of-life data, resource utiliza-
tionandVAresultsfromthetrialwereconvertedintoestimates
of overall medical costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs)
accruedduringthefirstyearofthetrial.6Amathematicalmodel
projected longer-term costs and health outcomes with each
therapy(eMaterialinSupplement).Eachtherapy’
sincremental
cost-effectivenessratio(ICER)wascalculated,definedasthera-
tio of its incremental cost (in 2015 US $) to its incremental ben-
efit(inQALYs)comparedwiththenext-besttherapy.Futureout-
comes were discounted at an annual rate of 3% to reflect their
present value.
Because treatment efficacy in the DRCR.net trial differed
significantly by baseline VA, the cost-effectiveness of these
therapies also was assessed for better (approximate Snellen
equivalentof20/32-20/40[EarlyTreatmentDiabeticRetinopa-
thy Study letter score of 78-69]) and worse (approximately
20/50 or worse [letter score <69]) VA subgroups.

tistical methods have been reported previously.1 All study par-
ticipants provide written informed consent.

QALY value for the entire year for each participant.
Calculated quality of life was reduced for participants ex-
periencing adverse events possibly caused by the study agent,
including myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, en-
dophthalmitis, retinal detachment, and vitreous hemor-
rhage. Both myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular acci-
dent were assumed to reduce quality of life for the remainder
of one’
s life; other adverse events resulted in one-time quality-
of-life decrements (eTable 1 in the Supplement). During the
1-year trial horizon, adverse events were identified and incor-
porated into the analysis based on patient-level trial data, dif-
fering nominally among the treatment arms. Because a differ-
ence in adverse event rates and mortality among the treatment
arms was not identified at 1 year in the trial or previous
meta-analyses,1,7 the same pooled rates were used for all anti-
VEGF agents in modeling projections beyond 1 year.
Key Points
Question What is the incremental cost-effectiveness of different
anti–vascular endothelial growth factor therapies over
bevacizumab for the treatment of diabetic macular edema?
Findings Visual acuity benefits of aflibercept and ranibizumab
translate into modest quality-of-life improvements but at a high
cost relative to bevacizumab, with incremental cost-effectiveness
ratios substantially higher than frequently cited thresholds (eg,
$100 000 per quality-adjusted life-year).
Meaning Physicians and policymakers should keep in mind these
results when considering the incremental cost-effectiveness of
these agents compared with bevacizumab.

To assess cost-effectiveness beyond 1 year, a mathemati-
cal model based on prior cost-effectiveness analyses for DME
was developed (eFigure 1 in the Supplement).8,9 A prior trial
using ranibizumab for DME found relatively stable mean VAs
1 to 5 years after treatment initiation4; accordingly, the model
assumes a patient’
s VA at 1 year remains constant throughout
the remainder of the patient’
s life, with ongoing monitoring
and anti-VEGF therapy as needed. This assumption was var-
ied widely in sensitivity analyses.
Costs
Overallcostswerecalculatedbyapplyingstandardizedunitcosts
to treatment and adverse event data from the trial, specifically
including adverse events and treatments with the potential to
vary among the treatment arms (eTable 2 and eTable 3 in the
Supplement).Injectioncostswerebasedontheaveragewhole-

Statistical Analysis
Unpaired, 2-tailed t tests assessed the significance of cost and
quality-of-life differences in 1-year data from the trial. Calcu-
lated P values reflect subject-level variance from trial data but
donotaccountforuncertaintyinunitcostorquality-of-lifedata
from outside sources.
Sensitivity Analyses
To assess robustness of these results and explore how differ-
ent assumptions might affect cost-effectiveness of the thera-
pies, several sensitivity analyses were performed. In univari-
ate and bivariate sensitivity analyses, effects of varying 1 or 2
key parameters at a time were assessed. In the base case analy-
sis, quality of life was mapped to visual acuity in the patient’
s
better-seeing eye; a sensitivity analysis used data from the UK-
based Randomized Evaluation of Sedation Titration for Re-
spiratoryFailure(RESTORE)trialofanti-VEGFtherapyforDME
to map quality of life to VA in the patient’
s treated eye (whether
it was the better- or worse-seeing eye).12 The effects of vary-
ing the time horizon of the modeling projections (1-30 years),
changes in VA achieved from using the 3 agents for 10 years
(±20 letters), adverse event rates (0%-100% of base case), and
others were explored. Costs of aflibercept and ranibizumab
were varied to determine at what prices they would have an
ICER below $100 000 per QALY, a threshold commonly con-
sidered meaningful for determining cost-effectiveness in the
United States.13-17
To assess uncertainty in model inputs, a probabilistic sen-
sitivityanalysiswasperformed.Synthetictrialtreatmentgroups
were created by randomly drawing 200 participants from each
trialarm,withreplacement;valuesformodelparameters,includ-
ingcosts,qualityoflife,andadverseeventrates,thenweredrawn

process was repeated 10 000 times with cost-effectiveness re-

Results
Quality of Life
Thestudyincluded624participants(mean[SD]age,60.6[10.5]
years;45.7%female;65.5%white),209intheafliberceptgroup,
207 in the bevacizumab group, and 208 in the ranibizumab
group.Fortheaflibercept,bevacizumab,andranibizumabarms,
respectively, the mean QALYs (Table 1) were 0.869 (95% CI,
0.857-0.880), 0.849 (95% CI, 0.835-0.862), and 0.857 (95%
CI, 0.843-0.872) during the first year of the trial; 0.835 (95%
CI, 0.817-0.854), 0.823 (95% CI, 0.807-0.840), and 0.829
(95% CI, 0.813-0.846) for participants with worse baseline vi-
sion; and 0.901 (95% CI, 0.891-0.911), 0.875 (95% CI, 0.855-
0.895), and 0.884 (95% CI, 0.861-0.907) for those with better
baseline vision (Table 1). Differences in mean QALYs among the
treatment arms were largest for aflibercept vs bevacizumab
among all participants (P = .03) (eTable 4 in the Supplement)
and aflibercept vs bevacizumab among those with better base-
linevision(P = .02)(eTable4intheSupplement).Allothercom-
parisons had P > .15 (eTable 4 in the Supplement).
Of note, these outcomes may appear at odds with origi-
nal trial results indicating the greatest VA benefit of afliber-
cept vs bevacizumab among the worse baseline vision group.
This difference reflects the nonlinear association between VA
and quality of life, as well as the fact that QALYs were summed
foreachmonthinthisanalysis,whereasVAwascomparedonly
at 1 year in the original trial (eMaterial in the Supplement).
Resources and Costs
Total mean costs per participant during 1 year (including study
eye and nonstudy eye anti-VEGF injections, laser photocoagu-
lation, and adverse events) in the aflibercept, bevacizumab,
and ranibizumab groups, respectively, were $26 100 (95% CI,
$24 400-27 700), $4100 (95% CI, $3000-5200), and $18 600
(95% CI, $17 100-20 200) (all differences P < .001) (Figure 1).
Anti-VEGF injections include the agent costs and a $102.97 fee
per injection. Overall mean costs were higher for those with
worse baseline vision ($28 100, $5000, and $20 400, respec-
tively) and lower for those with better baseline vision ($24 100,
$3200, and $16 900, respectively).
The largest component of total cost was study eye anti-
VEGF injections, comprising 68%, 37%, and 63% of total cost
in the aflibercept, bevacizumab, and ranibizumab groups,
respectively (Figure 1). Regardless of baseline vision, study eye

anti-VEGF injection costs were higher with aflibercept com-
pared with bevacizumab or ranibizumab and with ranibi-
zumab compared with bevacizumab (all differences P < .001).
A difference in cost for adverse events or laser photocoagula-
tion was not identified among the treatment arms for any of
the baseline vision subgroups.
One-Year Cost-effectiveness
For all participants, the ICERs of aflibercept and ranibizumab
compared with bevacizumab were $1 110 000 per QALY and
$1 730 000 per QALY, respectively (Table 1). For the subgroup
with worse baseline vision, the ICERs were $1 870 000 per
QALY and $2 450 000 per QALY; with better baseline vision,
they were $798 000 per QALY and $1 500 000 per QALY. The

Discussion
In the first year results of a DRCR.net trial in eyes with VAs of
20/50 or worse because of DME, aflibercept produced greater
meanVAgainscomparedwithbevacizumaborranibizumab.The
currentanalysissuggeststhattheVAbenefitsofaflibercepttrans-
lateintomodestquality-of-lifeimprovementsbutatahighcost
relativetobevacizumab,withtheICERssubstantiallyhigherthan
thresholdsof$50 000to$150 000perQALYfrequentlycitedin
cost-effectiveness literature and US guidelines. They remain
above these threshold values even under broad alternative as-
sumptions. It is unlikely that any realistic differences in VA
achieved with the 3 agents during years 2 to 10 (in the range of
changes seen in prior studies1,4,18-20) would alter their relative
cost-effectiveness.
With rapidly increasing US health care costs and given the
widelyvaryingcostsofintravitreousanti-VEGFagents,itseems
important that payers, policymakers, and physicians con-
sider both the costs and benefits of these agents. This analy-
sis demonstrates that, from the payer or policymaker perspec-
tive,usingbevacizumabratherthanthemoreexpensiveagents
would be cost-effective. Similarly, in contexts where bevaci-
zumab is not available, 0.3 mg of ranibizumab would be more
cost-effective than aflibercept.
From the perspective of patients or physicians, however,
the decision seems less clear-cut. For some patients with DME,
the expected additional visual benefits conferred by afliber-
ceptcomparedwithbevacizumabat1yearortheperceivedcon-
cerns over repackaging risks or lack of a US Food and Drug Ad-
ministration indication with bevacizumab may outweigh the
added health system cost ($22 000 at 1 year) and may out-
weigh any added personal expenses, such as copayments. This
tension highlights the challenge of balancing varying perspec-
tives of patients, physicians, payers, and policymakers when
efficacy results and cost-effectiveness are at odds or when in-
consistent comparative safety results across these agents are
reported in the literature.
Studylimitationsincludeusingtrialdataonlythrough1year

and mathematical modeling. However, sensitivity analyses in-

thus forgoing the need for repackaging, bevacizumab remains
the most cost-effective option (eTable 9 in the Supplement). In
addition, quality-of-life outcomes were based on VA outcomes
and prior data relating VA to quality of life; although VA is a re-
liable predictor of quality of life, direct measurement of quality
oflifestillwouldbepreferable.6Patient-specificfactors,suchas

Conclusions
Aflibercept (2.0 mg) and ranibizumab (0.3 mg) are not cost-
effective relative to bevacizumab for treatment of DME unless
their prices decrease substantially. Likewise, in contexts where
bevacizumabisunavailableforDMEtreatment,afliberceptisnot
cost-effective relative to ranibizumab. From a societal perspec-
tive,bevacizumabasfirst-linetherapyforDMEwouldconferthe
greatest value, along with substantial cost savings vs the other
agents. These results highlight the challenges that physicians,
