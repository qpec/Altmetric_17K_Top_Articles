Purpose
Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) may persist after treatment ends and may lead
to functional decline and falls. This study compared objective and self-report measures of physical
function, gait patterns, and falls between women cancer survivors with and without symptoms of
CIPN to identify targets for functional rehabilitation.
Methods
A secondary data analysis of 512 women cancer survivors (age, 62 6 6 years; time since diagnosis,
5.8 6 4.1 years) categorized and compared women self-reporting symptoms of CIPN (CIPN+) with
asymptomatic women (CIPN2) on the following: maximal leg strength, timed chair stand, physical
function battery, gait characteristics (speed; step number, rate, and length; base of support), self-
report physical function and disability, and falls in the past year.
Results
After an average of 6 years after treatment, 47% of women still reported symptoms of CIPN. CIPN+
had significantly worse self-report and objectively measured function than did CIPN2, with the
exception of maximal leg strength and base of support during a usual walk. Gait was slower among
CIPN+, with those women taking significantly more, but slower and shorter, steps than did CIPN2
(all P , .05). CIPN+ reported significantly more disability and 1.8 times the risk of falls compared with
CIPN2 (P , .0001). Increasing symptom severity was linearly associated with worsening function,
increasing disability, and higher fall risk (all P , .05).
Conclusion
This work makes a significant contribution toward understanding the functional impact of CIPN
symptoms on cancer survivors. Remarkably, 47% of women in our sample had CIPN symptoms
many years after treatment, together with worse function, greater disability, and more falls. CIPN
must be assessed earlier in the clinical pathway, and strategies to limit symptom progression and to
improve function must be included in clinical and survivorship care plans.

INTRODUCTION
Aggressive treatments for cancer have improved
survival but often cause serious long-term effects
on daily life that last for many years. Cancer
survivors report more functional limitations,
including reduced mobility, compared with per-
sons with no cancer history,1 and functional
declines are linked to shorter survival.2 Falls share
overlapping causes with functional declines and
are another significant concern for cancer sur-
vivors. The risk of falls increases after a cancer
diagnosis when compared with prediagnosis fall
rates,3 and fall rate in cancer survivors can be
twice that of cancer-free peers4 or community-
dwelling older adults.5
A
persistent
cancer
treatment–related
symptom that may influence physical func-
tion, fall risk, and quality of life (QOL) is
chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropa-
thy (CIPN). Neuropathies develop from nerve
damage caused by cytotoxic chemotherapies and
result in motor and sensory impairments and
symptoms of sensory loss in hands and feet,
burning, tingling, and pain.5 CIPN may occur in
up to 90% of patients during chemotherapy4 and
can persist in a proportion of survivors in the long

 term.6,7 CIPN is consistently associated with lower self-report
physical function and QOL during or after chemotherapy.8 In
older adults9 and in patients with diabetes,10,11 neuropathies are
associated with poor mobility, balance impairments, and falls.
Unfortunately, studies of physical function in people with CIPN
have relied on self-report instruments that are subject to bias, do
not identify the underlying causes of functional limitations, and are
poor at detecting declines early on. Fall risk may be elevated in
persons with CIPN, but studies are few and are limited by short
recall periods or reliance on self-report measures of fall risk
factors.12,13 A study of CIPN that includes objective measures of
physical function and fall risk, together with patient-reported
measures, would provide new information for oncology teams
to potentially screen for referral to rehabilitation teams. Tailoring
rehabilitation strategies to best prevent the disability and falls
associated with CIPN could improve patient safety and enhance
survivorship
care
plans
for
those
receiving
neurotoxic
chemotherapies.
To address this need, we conducted a secondary data analysis
of a pooled sample of women after cancer treatment. The purpose
of this study was to (1) determine the prevalence of CIPN
symptoms reported by women after chemotherapy; (2) compare
objective and patient-reported measures of physical function,
disability, and falls between women cancer survivors with and
without CIPN symptoms; and (3) examine the relationship be-
tween CIPN symptom severity and outcomes.
METHODS
Sample and Setting
We analyzed the baseline data of women cancer survivors enrolled
in four clinical exercise intervention trials (ClinicalTrials.gov iden-
tifiers:
NCT01635413,
NCT00662103,
NCT00591747,
and
NCT00659906).14-16Common eligibility criteria included having
a cancer diagnosis with no CNS involvement, being older than 50 years
of age, being insufficiently active (, 60 minutes of moderate-intensity
exercise per week), being free of metastatic disease and neurologic
conditions, being ambulatory, and having medical clearance to ex-
ercise. Eligible women completed a baseline visit at Oregon Health &
Science University that included self-report questionnaires and per-
formance tests. The university’s institutional review board approved
all study protocols, and the women consented to participate before
testing.
Assessment of CIPN Symptoms
Symptoms associated with CIPN were determined by self-report of
the presence or absence of noticeable dysthesia or parasthesia in the
lower extremities. On the basis of the sensory neuropathy items in the
Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy/Gynecologic Oncology
Group–Neurotoxicity,17 participants were asked if they experienced
numbness, tingling, or discomfort in their feet in the past week and were
then categorized into one of two groups: symptomatic (CIPN+) or
asymptomatic (CIPN2). Women reporting symptoms were asked if the
symptoms began during or after chemotherapy, and they were also asked
to report the severity of symptoms on a four-point scale: 1 = a little bit,
2 = somewhat, 3 = quite a bit, 4 = very much. Because our study focused
on mobility and falls, we assessed only symptoms in the lower extremities
and only for sensory symptoms, which are the most common and
distinguishable symptoms of CIPN compared with other symptoms (eg,
weakness)18 that could be related to other treatment or age-related
impairments (eg, sarcopenia). We could not verify a medical di-
agnosis of CIPN, nor could we confirm which women had received
chemotherapy known to cause CIPN.
Demographics, Health, and Clinical History
Self-report prevalence of chronic medical conditions was obtained by
the Charlson comorbidity index,19 physical activity levels with the
Community Healthy Activities Model Program for Seniors questionnaire,3
and cancer history and demographics with an in-house questionnaire.
Objectively Measured Outcomes
Lower-extremity
maximal
strength. Lower-extremity
maximal
strength was evaluated by a one-repetition maximal leg press test (kilo-
grams) using standard protocols.20 This test determines the maximal
amount of weight a woman can push a single time with her legs from
a seated upright position.
Objective physical function. Objective physical function was assessed
by the short physical performance battery (sPPB) consisting of the
summed score (0 to 12) from three timed tests: five-time chair stand,
standing balance, and 4-meter usual walk speed21; low scores predict
activities of daily living disability, hospitalization, nursing home admis-
sion, and mortality.21-24 Chair stand time and walk speed were also
evaluated separately because these tests independently predict poor out-
comes in older adults. Minimal clinically important differences are 0.5 for
PPB and 0.1 meters per second for gait speed25,26, whereas chair stand
time $ 12 seconds predicts a 2.4-fold increased risk of falls in older
adults.27
Characteristic gait speed and patterns. In addition to habitual walking
speed, abnormalities in gait (stepping) patterns can predict poor function
and fall risk.28 We measured characteristic gait speed and gait patterns by
having participants walk on an electronic walkway (GAITRite; CIR System,
Sparta, NJ). Gait patterns included step number, rate, and length; stride
length; base of support; and percentage of time in single support and
double support phases of the gait cycle.
Patient-Reported Outcomes
Physical function and mobility disability. Perceived physical function
and mobility disability were measured with the valid and reliable Late-Life
Function and Disability Instrument, which contains subscales of function
including basic and advanced lower-extremity function and disability.29,30
Scales on all three instruments range from 0 to 100, with higher scores
indicating better function or less disability.
Falls. A fall was defined as unintentionally coming to rest on the
ground or at some other lower level, not as a result of a major intrinsic
event (eg, stroke or syncope) or an overwhelming hazard.31 Participants
indicating a fall were asked about any resultant injury (ie, fractures, head
injuries, sprains, bruises, scrapes, or joint injuries) or need to seek medical
care.31 Recall periods for falls assessment varied slightly across studies;
women were asked if they experienced a fall in the past 6 months15 or in the
past year.14,16 We collapsed data into a single assessment of falls in the past
year.
Analysis
Standard t tests and x2 tests were used to compare clinical and
demographic variables between groups, and variables that differed sig-
nificantly were controlled for in subsequent analyses. Logistic and linear
regression models were used to examine the association between neu-
ropathy symptoms and outcomes. Linear regression coefficients and odds
ratios (with 95% CIs) were used to quantify effect size for the linear and
logistic regression models, respectively. We also applied the Hochberg
adjustment to fully adjusted models to account for potential false discovery
rates.32 Because gait characteristic variables are highly interdependent, we
included only walk speed as an outcome when adjusting P values.

 RESULTS
Sample
Women were older (63 6 6 years), obese (body mass index
[BMI], 29.6 6 6.6 kg/m2), had low comorbidity scores (1.9 6 1.6)
and a low prevalence of diabetes (11%), and were diagnosed
3 months to 33 years before enrollment (�
x, 6 years; Table 1).
Forty-seven percent of the sample reported that they currently
experienced sensory loss in their lower extremities. Women with
neuropathy symptoms (CIPN+) were significantly more likely
than were asymptomatic women (CIPN2) to be closer to their
cancer diagnosis, to have been diagnosed with stage II or III
cancer, to have been treated for a cancer other than breast cancer,
to be obese, to be less physically active, and to have worse
comorbidities. Groups were similar in terms of age, ethnicity,
employment, education, marital status, diabetes prevalence, and
past radiation therapy.
Objectively Measured Outcomes
Linear regression models were used to determine associations
between CIPN symptoms and outcomes, serially adjusting for the
group differences identified in Table 1. Model 1 was completely
unadjusted, with models 2, 3, and 4 accounting for the additional
influence of clinical characteristics, comorbidities, and lifestyle fac-
tors (BMI plus physical activity), respectively. In unadjusted models,
symptomatic women had significantly worse performance on
functional tests compared with asymptomatic women (sPPB, chair
stand, and characteristic gait, all P , .01) but had similar maximal leg
strength. For characteristic gait, symptomatic women took signifi-
cantly more, but shorter and slower, steps, had shorter strides, and

 spent more time in stance and double support phases of the gait cycle
than did asymptomatic women (all P , .05). The abnormal gait
pattern observed in symptomatic women is known as a conservative
gait pattern and is also seen in persons with diabetic peripheral
neuropathy.33,34 Significant differences remained in fully adjusted
models, with the exception of gait characteristics, where significance
was lost with final adjustment for BMI and physical activity.
Increasing CIPN symptom severity was linearly associated with
slower chair stand times, slower walking speeds, and worse sPPB
scores (P , .05; Appendix Table A1, online-only). Walking speed
slowed more when symptoms progressed from mild to moderate,
whereas chair stand and PPB scores were lowest when symptoms were
moderate to severe (Fig 1). Increasing symptom severity resulted in
increasingly worsening gait patterns (P , .05), with changes apparent
when severity progressed from mild to moderate (Fig 1).
Patient-Reported Outcomes
In both unadjusted and adjusted models, symptomatic
women reported significantly lower levels of basic and advanced
lower-extremity function and overall physical function and less
ability to perform activities of daily living independently, indicating
greater mobility disability than asymptomatic women (P , .01).
Increasing symptom severity was also linearly associated with de-
clining physical function and increasing mobility disability (P , .01;
Appendix Table A1). Physical function declined proportionately
with worsening symptoms, whereas disability worsened linearly with
moderate severity, but then reached a nadir (Fig 2).
A greater proportion of symptomatic women reported
falling in the past year (57%; mean number of falls per year, 0.7;
median, 0; range, 0 to 20 falls) compared with asymptomatic
women (43%; mean number of falls per year, 0.3; median, 0;
range, 0 to 10 falls; Table 2). Having CIPN symptoms significantly
increased the odds of falling in the past year compared with being
symptom free, even after adjusting for all covariates (P , .01;
Table 3). Symptomatic women were 1.8 times more likely to
report a fall than were asymptomatic women. Increasing
symptom severity increased the odds of falling by 1.5 times with
each unit increase in severity (P , .01; Table 4), but mostly when
symptoms were moderate or severe (Fig 2). The odds of

 DISCUSSION
Among our sizeable sample of women cancer survivors, we ob-
served that nearly one half still experienced sensory symptoms
associated with CIPN many years after completing chemotherapy.
Women with persistent CIPN symptoms performed worse on
several objective tests of physical function and reported poorer
functioning, more disability, and nearly twice the rate of falls
compared with asymptomatic women. Outcomes worsened with
increasing symptom severity. To our knowledge, this is the first
study to compare fall rates and both objectively measured and
patient-reported physical function among women with and
without persistent symptoms of CIPN. Our findings suggest that
CIPN symptoms remain a significant and potentially life-
threatening problem for cancer survivors well beyond comple-
tion of their chemotherapy and close to the time that many will
transition out of oncologic care.
Women with CIPN symptoms were 1.8 times more likely to
experience a recent fall than were asymptomatic women, even after
adjustment for covariates. Nearly one third of persons older than
65 years of age experience one or more falls every year.35 Despite
their younger age, the rate of falls in symptomatic women in our
study exceeded the rate in the general older adult population by
24%. Our findings corroborate a recent study in which post-
treatment breast cancer survivors who reported moderate to se-
vere CIPN symptoms had a 2.3 times greater fall risk than did
asymptomatic women,7 and a short prospective study that detected
an increase in fall risk with increasing CIPN symptoms over
2 months of neurotoxic chemotherapy.36 Our data extend these
findings to the broader population of women cancer survivors
whose CIPN symptoms persist years beyond treatment completion
and elevate fall risk.
Women with persistent symptoms reported significantly
worse physical function and more mobility disability than did
asymptomatic women. Differences remained after adjusting for
clinical characteristics and comorbidities, suggesting that CIPN
symptoms were not merely a proxy for worse disease and health
status. CIPN is linked to poorer health-related QOL8 and worse
self-report

instruments.12,37 Our study used patient-reported instruments
predictive of poor outcomes in older adults38 and found
meaningful group differences—symptomatic women had more
difficulty in tasks ranging from recreational activities to tasks
necessary for independent functioning than did asymptomatic
women. To our knowledge, we are also the first to study falls and
CIPN symptoms using objective measures that are sensitive and
specific indicators of functional mobility problems and fall risk
and are predictive of morbidity and mortality in older adults.39-42
Symptomatic women had significantly lower scores for PPB and
gait speed than did asymptomatic women, and group differences
were clinically meaningful25; however, absolute scores for both
groups were above that predictive of poor outcomes in older
adults,22,39,40 which may reflect the younger age of our sample. In
contrast, a measure of functional strength that requires patients
to stand repeatedly from a chair was abnormal in symptomatic
women, with their average score indicating increased fall risk.27
The inability to stand quickly during this performance test may be
attributable to poor sensorimotor feedback from the feet rather
than to muscle weakness, consistent with observations that

 sensory impairment is more common than motor impairment in
CIPN18 and our findings of similar maximal leg strength in
symptomatic
and
asymptomatic
women.
Current
exercise
guidelines for cancer survivors recommend general muscle-
strengthening exercises for overall conditioning,43 but our
findings suggest this approach may be insufficient to prevent
functional declines, disability, and falls in survivors with per-
sistent CIPN symptoms, who would benefit from a more task-
specific and functionally oriented approach to strength and
mobility training.
Results from the gait analysis indicate that even after ad-
justment for clinical characteristics and comorbidities, women
with CIPN symptoms displayed an abnormal gait pattern in
which they walked more slowly, took shorter steps, and spent
more time in the standing phases of gait to maintain stability
while walking. This conservative gait pattern, which is different
from that of normal walking,44 is associated with fall risk in aging
and diabetic peripheral neuropathy40-42 and stems from de-
creased proprioceptive sensory feedback to the lower extremities,
ankle weakness, and foot pain.33 The significance between groups
in terms of gait patterns disappeared after final adjustment for
BMI and physical activity, indicating a potential interplay be-
tween these factors and CIPN symptoms on gait that is worth
additional study.
In our sample, increasing symptom severity was strongly and
linearly associated with worsening objective and subjective func-
tion and increasing patient-reported disability and falls. Gait in-
stability may worsen early when symptoms progress from mild to
moderate, whereas functional strength declines as symptoms be-
come more severe. This pattern may reflect the additional motor
impairment that compounds sensory impairment with more se-
vere CIPN.5 Although falls did not seem to be elevated above age-
expected rates in women with mild CIPN symptoms, fall risk
increased sharply as symptoms progressed from mild to moderate
and moderate to severe. Our findings point to the importance of
early detection and management of CIPN to limit the progression
of symptoms before they affect function and also concomitantly to
timely referral to rehabilitation services to learn compensatory
strategies that preserve function and prevent disability and falls,
even if symptoms progress.
Our study had limitations, including the cross-sectional
design that prevents establishing cause and effect between
CIPN symptoms and study outcomes and the use of self-report
measures for clinical history. Our assessment of CIPN was limited
to self-report of sensory symptoms, rather than being based on
an objective neurologic examination. However, Huang et al17
reported that a reduced four-item scale of the Functional As-
sessment of Cancer Therapy/Gynecologic Oncology Group–
Neurotoxicity that assesses only sensory neuropathy is sufficient
to separate groups relative to clinically relevant CIPN, so it is
likely that we accurately classified our sample on the basis of self-
report symptoms.17 In our community-based sample, we could
not verify that participants received a chemotherapy agent known
to cause CIPN, so symptoms could be related to a different
condition; however, women confirmed that symptoms began
after chemotherapy and were thus less likely to be related to other
causes (ie, diabetes). Our data may or may not generalize to male
cancer survivors, although sex is not a known risk factor for
CIPN.6
Our findings suggest that a high proportion of women
treated with chemotherapy for a variety of cancers may experi-
ence persistent symptoms of CIPN many years after their
treatment ends and that these women have abnormal gait pat-
terns and more functional deficits, patient-reported disability,
and falls compared with women with no symptoms. Falls are
disabling and life threatening and lead to health care costs of
approximately $17,000 per event,35 and poor self-report physical
function has been linked to shorter survival times in cancer
survivors.2 CIPN contributes to excess health care costs, in-
cluding those associated with hospitalizations, neurology spe-
cialist visits, and outpatient visits, and may influence return to
work, adding to the economic and societal burden of cancer.45
Currently, clinical practice guidelines focus on pharmacologic
management of CIPN,46 which remains suboptimal, and on the
use of patient report to identify dose-limiting toxicities during
therapy, which miss detecting long-term functional deficits and
associated disability. Using standardized clinical tests and patient-
reported outcomes validated in older adults, we determined that
persistent CIPN symptoms may have serious functional conse-
quences. Thresholds for early detection of functional declines
related to CIPN must be established and functional screening
subsequently integrated into the clinical pathway of patients
receiving
neurotoxic
treatment.
Rehabilitation
focused
on
strength and balance training is known to prevent disability and
falls in older adults and in persons with neurologic condi-
tions47-49 and may be a reasonable initial recommendation for
persons with CIPN.50 However, our data suggest that the etiology
of disability and falls associated with CIPN symptoms may be
unique; thus, efforts to define, implement, and evaluate the ef-
ficacy and cost effectiveness of specific prevention strategies for
persons with CIPN are urgently needed.
