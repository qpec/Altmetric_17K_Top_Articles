Abstract
There are more than 10 million prisoners worldwide, and the prevalence of all investigated mental 
disorders is higher than general population comparisons. Although the extent to which prison 
increases the incidence of mental disorders is uncertain, there is considerable evidence of low rates 
of identification and treatment of psychiatric disorders. Prisoners are also at increased risk of all-
cause mortality, suicide, self-harm, violence, and victimization, and research has outlined some 
modifiable risk factors. High quality treatment trials for psychiatric disorders in prisoners have 
been limited. Despite this, it has been shown in trials that opiate substitution treatments reduce 
substance misuse relapse and possibly reoffending. The mental health needs of women and older 
adults in prison are distinct, and national policies should be developed to meet these. Clinical,

 research, and policy recommendations to improve prison mental healthcare are presented. National 
attempts to meet these recommendations should be annually surveyed.
Introduction
There are more than 10 million individuals in prison at any given time with more than 30 
million circulating through each year. Research has consistently shown that prisoners have 
high rates of psychiatric disorders, and in some countries there are more people with severe 
mental illness in prisons than psychiatric hospitals. Despite the high level of need, these 
disorders are frequently underdiagnosed and poorly treated. In this structured review, we 
provide an overview of the epidemiology of psychiatric disorders in prison, summarise 
information on rates of suicide and violence victimisation and risk factors for these 
outcomes, and outlineevidence-based interventions for mental health. Based on this, we 
propose a series of clinical, research, and policy recommendations. The aim is to provide a 
broad synthesis of the main issues relating to the mental health of adult prisoners, and 
highlight gaps in evidence and practice. Two special populations are briefly discussed, 
namely women and older adults. Juveniles in prison have distinct mental health needs, and 
an overview of these is outside the scope of this review.
In this review, we have used the terms jails and prisons interchangeably and include those 
who have received a criminal sentence and are detained pretrial (but not individuals in police 
custody or detained for non-criminal reasons,such as immigration centres).
Search strategy and selection criteria
We conducted a structured search for systematic reviews on prisoner mental health over 
2003-2015. We supplemented the search by identifying large primary studies on individual 
psychiatric disorders, rates and risk factors for adverse outcomes, and interventions for 
mental health problems. We scanned reference lists of papers identified. Search terms and 
selection criteria are presented in the Panel.
Prevalence
Many primary studies and reviews have documented the high prevalence of most psychiatric 
disorders in prisoners (Table 1); however caution is warranted when interpreting these data. 
First, published studies may overestimate prevalence. Self-report approaches to clinical 
diagnosis are problematic. In addition, prisoners assessed by lay interviewers have been 
associated with higher prevalences compared to diagnostic interviews conducted by 
clinically trained psychiatrists or psychologists.1 Certain disorders may be particularly prone 
to overestimation. One example is ADHD; heterogeneity between the primary research 
studies on prevalence is substantial. One systematic review reported that 26% of adult 
prisoners have an ADHD diagnosis,2 in contrast to two recent high quality studies using 
self-report measures and diagnostic instruments with reported prevalence rates of 17%3 and 
11%4, respectively. This disparity suggests that the choice of statistical models when 
pooling prevalence estimates needs careful consideration. In particular, random effects 
models should be used with caution as they weight smaller studies similarly to the larger

 ones. If used, they should be complemented with a fixed effects model, and examination of 
individual study quality. For some diagnoses, large high quality studies should be prioritised 
over many smaller investigations that may reflect publication bias. Furthermore, the 
heterogeneity of prevalence estimates may reflect real differences related to variations in 
community rates for individual disorders around the world, how the police and courts 
approach mental illness, incarceration rates for different crimes, and provision of prison 
healthcare. Where variations between countries is large, pooling estimates may not be 
meaningful and prevalence ranges should be provided.
Some prevalence studies of personality disorders in prisoners are problematic for similar 
reasons. Large high quality studies using clinically-based diagnoses have reported 
prevalences between 7-10%5,6 compared to the 65% found in reviews of studies that have 
used diagnostic instruments.1 The discrepancy may be partly explained due to the inclusion 
of antisocial personality disorder, the most common personality disorder in prisoners, for 
which diagnostic criteria overlap with the reasons for entering prison and diagnostic 
instruments will score. Three of these criteria (disregarding norms and rules, low threshold 
for aggression or violence, and inability to profit from experience) are together highly 
correlated with criminogenic factors.
A second problem is that many diagnostic instruments currently used have not been 
validated in prisons, and include items that may not be specific. For example, the MINI 
diagnostic interview isextensively used in newer prison studies, and without modification 
canlead to overestimating rates of mania and obsessive-compulsive disorder.7 In addition, 
screening tools may be particularly susceptible to false positives. For example, in a recent 
investigation to identify autism spectrum disorders in Scottish prisoners, only 6% of those 
that screened positive were clinically diagnosed with such disorders.8 As a result, case 
identification is poor.9
Despite these caveats, a number of prevalence findings are consistent. The evidence for 
major depression and psychotic illnesses is the strongest. A 2012 systematic reviewof 
around 33,000 prisoners and over 100 studies found very similar findings to a previous 2002 
review (Table 1). According to these reviews, one in seven prisoners has major depression or 
psychosis, with little change in rates over the last three decades.10 Another consistent 
theme, including in low and middle income (LMI) countries, is the high rate of substance 
misuse. Recent research has also demonstrated high rates of comorbidity between mental 
illness and substance misuse.11 Such comorbidity worsens the prognosis of the individual 
psychiatric disorders, and has been shown to increase repeat offending and premature 
mortality following release.12 A further finding consistently reported is the higher rate of 
psychiatric disorders, particularly depression10 and drug dependence13, in female prisoners. 
Future prevalence research should focus on special populations, prisoners in LMI countries, 
and investigating comorbidities. The new problem of novel psychoactive agents, which is 
common in many prisons, requires more research, and whether it exacerbates mental health 
problems and other risks. In England and Wales, the Inspectorate of Prisons stated that these 
substances, particularly synthetic cannabinoids, have led to increased violence in prison as a 
direct result of drug intoxication or increased bullying due to drug debts.14 The difficulties,

 however, of reliable detection and disincentives to self-report their use mean that innovative 
designs are required.
A key issue in this field is the direction of causality for the high prevalences of psychiatric 
disorders, namely whether the excess in rates is caused by prison or whether they are 
imported into prison.There is evidence for the importation hypothesis since severe mental 
illnesses are associated with criminality,15,16 but more longitudinal studies are needed 
following entry into prison (See Research Recommendations). One prospective study in 
English prisons found that symptoms of depression decreased in the months following 
arrival in prison, but psychotic symptoms remained stable.17 Although the study was 
underpowered for categorical psychiatric diagnoses, it suggested that the stresses secondary 
to criminal conviction and prison entry are not the only explanations for high rates of mental 
disorder. Self-report data from a national survey of Australian prisoners found that around 
half those interviewed reported that their mental health improved during their imprisonment.

In the subsequent section, we will review adverse outcomes that are associated with 
psychiatric disorders.
Adverse Outcomes
Suicide and Self-harm
Suicide and self-harm are more common in prisoners than community-based persons of 
similar age and gender. Where studied, the relative risks of suicide in male prisoners are 
around 3-6 compared to the general population, and higher risks in women prisoners (with 
relative risks typically more than 6). Explanations for the differences in relative risks 
between countries is not clear and is not correlated with incarceration rates or general 
population suicide rates.19 More widely, suicide numbers are difficult to validate due to 
misclassification of suicides as accidents, unknown or natural deaths, and reluctance in some 
countries to characterise self-inflicted deaths in custody as suicides. For this reason, we 
suggest that all-cause mortality in prison may be a better proxy than official suicide ratesfor 
international comparisons when including countries where suicide reporting in prisons has 
not been validated. Using data routinely collected in the European Union, we have 
calculated three-year all-cause mortality rates in EU countries with at least two years of data 
(presented in Figure 1).20,22 These show some notable differences between Western and 
Eastern Europe which may be explained by higher rates of death from infectious diseases in 
the latter. However, in Western Europe, higher rates of all-cause mortality in prison for 
Belgium and Portugal need further examination. When looking specifically at suicide, 
France is an outlier with a reported suicide rate of 179 per 100,000 prisoners23 whereas 
most countries report around 100-150 per 100,000. Interestingly, another outlier is the US 
where suicide rates in local jails are 41 per 100,000, and in state prisons 16 per 100,000.24 
One possible explanation is the higher proportion of African American and Hispanic 
prisoners there, who have lower suicide rates, but even in white prisoners, suicide rates 
appear to be lower than in many European countries (80 per 100,000 in U.S. local jails and 
25 per 100,000 in U.S. state prisons).24

 Self-harm is a substantial cause of morbiditybut less studied than suicide. A recent 
epidemiological study in English and Welsh prisons found that in the previous 12 months in 
custody, 5-6% of men and 20-24% of women self-harmed.25 Risk factors include younger 
age and short sentences, and there is evidence that self-harm clusters in certain prison 
settings. A summary of risk factors for suicide, near-lethal self-harm, and self-harm are 
presented in Table 2. Near-lethal self-harm has been shown to be a valid proxy for 
completed suicide in prisons, and has advantages over psychological autopsy approaches 
because it allows for a broader and deeper range of risk factors to be evaluated.26
In terms of interventions for the management of suicide and self-harmin prison, a number 
have been reviewed,27 ranging from screening on reception, staff training, treatment, 
appropriate supervision of at-risk prisoners, and improvements to the safety of the physical 
environment and social support. Overall, the studies have indicated the importance of 
adequate screening for suicide risk with comprehensive care planning based on identified 
risk on arrival to prison. However, this research is difficult to appraise as most report many 
simultaneous changes within a prison system, so independent effects cannot be reliably 
determined. For example in England and Wales, the suicide prevention and management 
strategyfor prisons was amended in 2004 by improving identification and risk assessment,28 
and there was a subsequent reduction in prison suicide rates over 2004 to 2006, although 
rates have increased since 2012.29,30Screening tools for identifying prisoners at risk of 
suicide and self-harm were reviewed in 2010.31 Sensitivity and specificity varied widely 
between tools, but since none of the studies were prospective, limited conclusions can be 
drawnand more research is needed on screens that have high specificities (see Research 
Recommendations). Another recommended intervention has been training of suicide risk 
assessment and management, often focusing on communication skills. Evaluations of 
training programmes have not been sufficiently robust to show an effect on suicide 
outcomes, but have reported that these approaches are acceptable to staff.27
Guidelines for suicide prevention have recommended early screening of prisoners at first 
reception to custody, actions taken in response to positive screening, and ongoing risk 
monitoring.32 Multidisciplinary information sharing and decision-making are emphasised 
along with appropriate mental health treatment (see Clinical Recommendations). Finally 
staff training and environmental safety (e.g., removal of potential risks such as ligature 
suspension points) are recommended.
Violence and Victimisation
Other adverse outcomes that may arise as a result of psychiatric disorders are violence and 
victimisation within prison. While violence is common in many prisons, little research exists 
on its prevalence. Some studies have estimated the rates of physical assault are 13 to 27 
times higher than the general population.33,35 Non-lethal prisoner-on-prisoner physical 
assault is the most frequently seen form of violence in prison, though homicides are 
reported.36 One recent study involving 7,528 US prisoners found a six-month prevalence 
rate of 205 per 1000 for inmate-on-inmate physical violence and 246 per 1000 for staff-on-
inmate physical violence.33 US official statistics suggest that the rate of violent assaults on 
prison staff (155 per 1000 persons) is more than double that of mental health staff.37 UK 
Fazel et al.

 data for 2015 showed that per 1000 prisoners, there were 198 incidents of assault on a 
prisoner, and 46 of assault on staff.38 Again, methodological problems mean that exact 
figures should be interpreted with caution; official statistics underestimate violence 
prevalence and base rates of violence can vary due to differences in violence definition and 
measurement.
Research aimed at understanding violence within prisons has investigated individual pre-
incarceration characteristics and contextual factors. A meta-analysis of 90 studies (published 
between 1996 and 2012) of institutional infractions found that strong contextual predictors 
of infractions were higher levels of gang activity, larger prison populations, and a higher 
security level of the institution or proportion of high-security inmates. In contrast, modestly 
lower infractions rates were found in settings with a greater level of employment inside 
prison. The strongest socio-demographic predictor of prison misconduct was a younger age, 
whereas being black, unmarried, and with a low education level were weaker correlates. In 
terms of criminological characteristics, the presence of prior infractions was the strongest 
predictor, while conviction for a violent offence was not a significant predictor.39 Early 
deviant behaviours (i.e., a more extensive criminal history, a younger age when first arrested, 
and prior incarcerations) have also been associated with management difficulties while 
incarcerated. Finally, clinical variables such as aggressiveness, impulsiveness, antisocial 
traits, and psychopathy are robust predictors of institutional infractions.40,41
Prisoners with mental health disorders are disproportionately involved in prison infractions 
and violent incidents,41,42 and are more likely to be charged with violating prison rules than 
other prisoners, and twice as likely to be injured in a fight.43 Mentally disordered offenders 
with a history of violence are at even greater risk.44
In terms of victimisation, official estimates under-represent its extent in prisons as there are 
socio-cultural disincentives to reporting and a particular reluctance of prisoners to report 
staff victimisation.45 Prisoners who have characteristics making them more likely victims of 
physical assault (e.g., transgender, intellectual disability) may be systematically over- or 
underrepresented, while victimisation by staff may be under-reported. Physical violence is 
only one form of victimisation and should be considered alongside property theft, emotional 
and psychological victimisation, intimidation, and sexual victimisation.
A summary of risk factors (Table 2) demonstrates that psychiatric disorder is associated with 
violence and victimisation outcomes in prison. This is corroborated by a large US regional 
survey of state prisons with a total of 7,528 individuals, where one in 12 male prisoners with 
a mental disorder reported at least one incident of sexual victimisation by another prisoner 
over a six-month period, compared with one in 33 male prisoners without a mental disorder, 
and sexual victimisation was three times as high among female prisoners (23%) as among 
male prisoners (8%).34 Mental disorder also increased risks of physical victimisation. Men 
in prison with any mental disorder were 1.6 times (prisoner-on-prisoner) and 1.2 times 
(staff-on-prisoner) higher than men with no mental disorder to be physically victimized. 
Female prisoners with mental disorder were 1.7 times more likely to report being physically 
victimized by another prisoner than their non-mentally disorderedpeers.33

 Overall, we have demonstrated the confluence of adverse outcomes that mentally disordered 
are at increased risk of. These include self-harm, suicide, violence and victimization in 
prison, and premature mortality and reoffending on release. The risk factors have little 
specificity, and also few are shared across these outcomes. Two that are shared are mental 
illness and substance misuse. But without further clarification of modifiable risk factors, 
development of effective interventions will be limited. Environmental risk factors need to be 
considered, such as staffing, overcrowding, policies, and the extent and nature of daytime 
activities, and considered alongside individual-level factors.
Interventions
Mental Illness
Many interventions aimed at prisoner mental health have been evaluated, though mostly on a 
small scale. The small sample size, and heterogeneity of prisoners and settings makes 
synthesis of the research difficult. The lack of research conducted in prisons compared to 
community settings is secondary to a combination of organisational difficulties (such as 
obtaining permissions and running interventions alongside mandated programmes), a lack of 
specific research funding, and a perceived division of prisoner health from public health in 
general (see Research Recommendations).
The number of medication trials conducted in prisons is particularly low. Some small RCTs 
have found evidence for ADHD medications in Swedish prisoners, including improved 
global functioning46 and increased likelihood of abstinence from amphetamine after release 
(as measured by negative urine samples).47 Work with other medications is limited. Another 
study found that, in women with bipolar disorder, following an evidence-based 
pharmacological treatment algorithm was no better than treatment as usual (where 
medication decisions were taken by the treating clinician)48 for reducing symptoms and 
improving medication adherence. More psychopharmacology research in prison settings is 
required, particularly for commonly prescribed psychotropic medications (see Research 
Recommendations).
Compared with medication, there are more controlled trials of psychological therapies in 
prisoners, but these are typically small and involve a wide variety of interventions (e.g., 
cognitive behavioural [CBT], interpersonal, dialectical behavioural [DBT], meditation-
based, and group therapies) with inconsistent findings. Larger trials include a study of yoga 
amongst 167 prisoners, where participants randomised to yoga had lower self-rated 
psychological distress and improved cognitive performance than controls who kept an 
exercise diary.49 In another study, 120 Iranian prisoners were randomised to receive 
individual CBT, combined individual and group CBT, or placed on a waiting list. The study 
reported improvements in psychological well-being symptom scores for the sample 
receiving combined therapy relative to controls.50 Another study included 63 prisoners who 
received a modified form of DBT and were then randomised into receiving eight weeks of 
further DBT or case management.51 Those receiving further DBT showed a reduction in 
psychopathological symptoms at six months compared with the case management group but 
not at twelve months.

 In summary, there is some evidence for these psychological interventions, but their effect 
sizes are not large, whether they would hold in better quality designs (e.g. using active 
controls and not waiting list or treatment as usual controls), and it is uncertain whether any 
improvements are sustained. While there are further psychological treatment trials involving 
female prisoners and individuals with substance misuse (see below), there is a lack of high 
quality large trials. Thus, theeffectivenessof commonly used psychological interventions to 
treat mental health problemsneeds further clarification (see Research Recommendations). 
Furthermore, in the absence of good quality treatment trials in prisons, treatments developed 
in the community need to be imported and evaluated (see Clinical Recommendations). The 
prison environment, in particular the increased structures, different rules, housing, and 
access to drugs create unique challenges, which may explain why psychological treatments 
do not generalise well. It also suggests that tailored interventions for prisoners, particularly 
for substance misuse, are required.
Substance Misuse
Research into prisoners with substance misuse includes trials of pharmacological and 
psychological interventions. Differences in study design, sample size, and a variety of 
heterogeneous outcome measures make synthesis of the data difficult. Nevertheless, it is 
possible to provide some principles of treatment.
Alcohol and opiates are the two most common and problematic substances for detoxification 
management in prisons although provision of such treatment services is variable. One survey 
found that only 34% of US jails offer any detoxification treatment52 equating to about one 
million arrestees annually being at risk of untreated withdrawal from alcohol, including 
delirium tremens and its associated high mortality.53 A 2010 Cochrane review summarizing 
evidence from 64 RCTs in community settings found that benzodiazepines are effective 
against alcohol withdrawal seizures compared to placebo, and are protective for many 
outcomes compared to alternative drugs.54
The management of opiate withdrawal in prison is generally symptomatic, and mostly based 
on detoxification rather than maintenance. A systematic review identified 23 controlled trials 
with 2467 adult opioid userswhich included samples with criminal histories.55 Participants 
were randomised to receive methadone or another pharmacological agent, with evidence 
finding slow tapering with long-acting opioids reduced withdrawal severity, though relapse 
was common.55 One exemplar included in this review is the Leeds Evaluation of Efficacy of 
Detoxification Study (LEEDS), an open-label RCT of 306 prisoners in three English prisons. 
This trial compared methadone and buprenorphine detoxification and found equivalent 
clinical effectiveness. A further RCT from this group compared dihydrocodeine and 
buprenorphine demonstrating comparable effectiveness for acute opiate detoxification.56 On 
the basis of this evidence, all prisoners should be offered acute detoxification on arrival (see 
Clinical Recommendations).
Psychological treatments for substance misuse include therapeutic communities (TC), CBT, 
and motivational interviewing (MI). A meta-analysis of prison-based TCs suggests that 
participation increases treatment success, with those TCs followed by aftercare in the 
community most effective at reducing relapse and re-incarceration.57 A meta-analysis of 
Fazel et al.

 Moral Reconation Therapy, which focuses on moral reasoning and originally a component 
of TC, generally supported success in reducing recidivism.58
A variety of CBT-based therapies studied in prison populations with substance misuse 
demonstrate effectiveness compared to drug and alcohol education or no treatment. 
However, design limitations prevent clear generalizability, and study outcomes generally 
focus on rate of re-incarceration as a proxy for relapse.58 Reasoning and Rehabilitation 
(R&R), a 35-session CBT program focusingon prosocial attitudes, emotion regulation and 
self-control, and interpersonal problem solving, has demonstrated reductions in recidivism.
59
MI is regarded as an evidence-based treatment, particularly for alcohol misuse. One RCT of 
adolescents incarcerated for driving while intoxicated found lower rates of re-offence with 
MI compared to relaxation training.60
Apart from psychological treatments, there is good evidence for the treatment of opiateand 
alcohol misuse with medication assisted therapy (MAT), which combines pharmacological 
treatments (including methadone, buprenorphine and naltrexone) and psychological 
approaches. A recent extensive literature search of MAT found 15 methodologically rigorous 
evaluations from six European countries, containing 3953 participants. There were 
significant positive outcomes of treatment on reoffending (d=0.47) and drug use (d=0.38).61 
Using slightly different criteria, a Cochrane review of MAT for offenders with substance 
misuse found 11 studies met criteria for inclusion; overall results reflect that MAT reduces 
drug use in this population.62
Methadone maintenance therapy (MMT) has been implemented in many countries. A recent 
Cochrane review showed that MMT decreases heroin use and enhances treatment retention 
compared to non-pharmacologic treatments.63
Starting methadone prior to release is significantly more effective for treatment retention, 
reduced drug use, and reduced reoffending than either counselling alone or simple referral to 
MMT upon release.64,65 An RCT conducted at a US prison compared MMT plus 
counselling, counselling and community referral, and counselling alone for 204 individuals 
demonstrated increased post release treatment retention and decreased drug abuse with 
persisting benefits at 6 months and twelve months post-release for those in MMT.66 Another 
RCT compared MMT versus monitored withdrawal found that higher rates returned to 
treatment in the community upon release in the MMT sample.67
A number of program evaluations have demonstrated reduction in opiate use following 
release when individuals were started during incarceration. One RCT conducted in New 
York City compared MMT to buprenorphine and found equivalence in self-reported relapse, 
but superiority for buprenorphine treated patients for post-release treatment engagement.68 
Another RCT with 211 offenders compared buprenorphine treatment to counselling initiated 
pre-release demonstrated increased community treatment entry for those randomized to 
buprenorphine.69 Some RCT evidence supports the use of intramuscular naltrexone as an 
alternative to methadone.70
Fazel et al.

 In summary, the evidence supports the use of MMT in the offender population, and further 
research with intramuscular naltrexone and oral buprenorphine is warranted. Additionally, 
there is a relative paucity of studies treating alcohol misuse in prisoners. Nevertheless, on the 
basis of evidence we have reviewed, opiate substitution and CBT-based relapse prevention 
therapies should be made available to all prisoners (see Clinical Recommendations).
Women in Prison
Most prisons across the world are separated by gender, and research has shown that the 
demographic, health, and criminal characteristics of female prisoners are different to males. 
In this section, we review some specificareas of prison research. Some trauma-focused 
interventions for female prisoners have been developed. However, most are small and have 
reported non-significant findings, which may represent inadequate power. â€˜Seeking Safetyâ€™, 
a trauma-focused CBT intervention, has not been demonstrated to have improved outcomes 
compared with treatment as usual (i.e., 180-240 hours of individual and group treatment).71 
Another RCT comparing trauma affect regulation with supportive group therapy was also 
not associated with differences in recovery between groups.72 Despite disappointing results 
to date, larger studies are needed to fully evaluate the efficacy of trauma-focused therapies 
(see Research Recommendations). There is a lack of RCTs for other interventions amongst 
women prisoners including CBT, mindfulness, and DBT.
In addition, a small number of studies have focused on psychiatric morbidity in prisoners at 
specialised mother and baby units.73
Older Adults in Prison
The number and proportion of older adults in prison is rising in high income countries. In 
several prison populations, those over 60 are now the fastest-growing age group, and the 
number is expected to continue rising as the population ages. Much of the research on older 
prisoners has described demographic, criminal and health characteristics,74 supplemented 
with newer research on health, social and custodial needs.75 There have been very few 
intervention studies despite their increased chronic physical health problems, depression, 
and functional ability.
Conclusions
Mental disorders are overrepresented in prisoners. The strongest evidence is for serious 
mental disorders, where surveys have estimated that around one in seven prisoners are 
diagnosed with psychosis or clinical depression. Substance abuse is also increased many 
fold in prisoners. For many other disorders, the picture is complicated by self-reported 
approaches to diagnosis which overestimate rates, and meta-analyses relying on random 
effects models that weigh small studies similarly to larger higher quality investigations. 
Further research should move beyond simple prevalence studies and examine the 
contribution of prison to these excess rates, and the extent, consequences and patterns of 
novel psychoactive substance use. Individuals in prison with mental health problems are at 
increased risk of suicide, self-harm, violence and victimisation. There is little specificity in 
risk factors for these outcomes and few are shared across them, limiting development of 
effective interventions. Thus, interventions will mostly have to rely on evidence from non-

 prison settings, although some prison-specific research has suggested that the 
pharmacological treatment of ADHD, and CBT-based treatments for depression, may 
improve outcomes. High quality RCT evidence exists on methadone maintenance and opioid 
substitution treatments, but little on how to treat alcohol misuse. A number of special groups 
in prison including women and older prisoners appear to have specific mental health needs 
and may need tailored treatments. Justice departments should collaborate with researchers as 
addressing the paucity of treatment research will need concerted action by government, 
funding agencies, and researchers.
On the basis of this review, we have outlined a number of recommendations relevant to 
clinical practice and research (Panel 2). In addition, we have included policy 
recommendations incorporating several outlined by the World Health Organisation.76 
Relevant to these recommendations is surveillance of key indicators on a regular basis. We 
have suggested a format for the presentation of these key indicators for England and Wales 
(Figure 2) and for 13 other Western European, North American, and Australasian countries 
(Supplemental eFigures) which would allow comparison between different countries,

determined by those with populations of over 5 million and GDPâ€™s in the top half ($35,000

 Panel 1
Search strategy and selection criteria
We searched PubMed and Web of Knowledgefor articles published from1 January 2003 
to 31 December 2015. Search terms included (prison* or jail* or offender* or criminal* 
or inmate* or correction* or penitentiar*) and (RCT* or trial*or randomi* or control*) 
for intervention studies supplemented with searches based on (mental* or psychiatr* or 
drug* or alcohol or substance*) for prevalence and interventions, with (suicid* or (self 
and (harm* or injur* or inflict*)) and (violen* or infraction* or assault* or victim* or 
bullying or bullie*) for adverse outcomes. Searches also included citations to studies 
selected for inclusion. We preferentially includedrecent systematic reviews and meta-
analyses, unselected prisoner samples for prevalence research, and RCTs with 50 or more 
participants for the sections on interventions. Unlike a systematic review, reference lists 
were not manually checked, nor was a meta-analysis considered.

 Panel 2
Clinical Recommendations
-
All prisons should have systems in place for the identification of those with 
serious mental health problems, including case finding on arrival to prison 
and allocation to appropriate level of service (i.e. primary/secondary/
transfer to hospital)
-
All prisons should have a suicide prevention strategy that includes accurate 
screening and monitoring of risk after arrival into prison, multi-disciplinary 
management of high risk prisoners, and staff training.
-
Evidence-based psychological and pharmacological mental health 
treatments that are available in the community or developed for prison 
settings should be provided
-
There should be monitoring of substance dependent prisoners, and 
provision of drug and alcohol acute detoxification on arrival to all prisons
-
Methadone or alternative (e.g. buprenorphine) maintenance therapy should 
be available in all prisons with systems in place to link prisoners with 
appropriate services to continue treatment on release if indicated
-
Provision of CBT for relapse prevention of substance misuse
-
Prisons should consider provision of trauma-focused and gender-specific 
interventions to prisoners, particularly if unmet needs are identified
-
Minimum standards for meaningful daytime activity (education/courses/
training) should be developed that include the amount and range of these 
activities
Research Recommendations
-
More prevalence studies should not be prioritised as there have been more 
than 100 high quality ones with little variation between and within countries 
for the severe mental disorders
-
Longitudinal studies of mental health in prisoners and the use of novel 
psychoactive agents are required
-
Screening tools for suicide risk and identification of severe mental illness 
are required that have false positive rates that will not overwhelm prison 
health services
-
Funding bodies should consider prison-specific research calls
-
Clarification of the most effective pharmacological treatments for common 
mental disorders in prison (such as PTSD, anxiety disorders, depression)
-
More evidence is required to determine which psychological therapies are 
most effective for mental health problems in prison, and whether they can

 be provided in a group-based formats. More research is required for trauma-
based treatments in women prisoners
-
Research on treatment for alcohol use disorders in prisoners, and also 
intramuscular naltrexone and oral buprenorphine as opiate substitution 
therapies
-
Evidence-based approaches to diversion of mentally ill offenders from 
prison, particularly women and young people
-
Development of prediction rules/tools that will enable prisons to stratify 
prisoners into risk groups, particularly for mentally disordered individuals 
in prison
Policy Recommendations (including WHO recommendations)76
-
Adherence to basic principles of human and prison rights
-
Equivalence of health care services in prison to those available in the 
community
-
Equity of funding for mental and physical health services (including 
ensuring that mental health services receive at least the same proportion of 
funding as they receive in the community)
-
Consideration of the social needs of prisoners in addition to health
-
Management of prison health by public health systems, particularly in 
relation to employment of healthcare staff
-
National prison services should have a strategy for their management of 
health and social needs of older prisoners
-
National systems need to be instituted that collect annual information on 
deaths in prison including by suicide, overcrowding rates, prisoner-prisoner 
and prisoner-staff assault rates, self-harm rates by gender, availability of 
methadone maintenance therapy, and research activity (see Figure 2 for 
England and Wales, and country cards for 11other high-income countries in
