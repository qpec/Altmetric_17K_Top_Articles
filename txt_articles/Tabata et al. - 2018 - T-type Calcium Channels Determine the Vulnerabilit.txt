SUMMARY
Parkinsondisease(PD)isaprogressive neurologicaldisease causedbyselective degenerationofdopaminergic(DA)neuronsinthe substantia
nigra. Although most cases of PD are sporadic cases, familial PD provides a versatile research model for basic mechanistic insights into the
pathogenesis of PD. In this study, we generated DA neurons from PARK2 patient-specific, isogenic PARK2 null and PARK6 patient-specific
induced pluripotent stem cellsandfound that these neurons exhibitedmore apoptosis and greater susceptibility to rotenone-inducedmito-
chondrial stress. From phenotypic screening with an FDA-approved drug library, one voltage-gated calcium channel antagonist, benidi-
pine, was found to suppress rotenone-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, we demonstrated the dysregulation of calcium homeostasis and
increased susceptibility to rotenone-induced stress in PD, which is prevented by T-type calcium channel knockdown or antagonists. These
findings suggest that calcium homeostasis in DA neurons might be a useful target for developing new drugs for PD patients.
INTRODUCTION
Parkinson disease (PD) is one of the most common neuro-
degenerative disorders, and PD patients display progressive
motor dysfunction such as tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity
and postural instability due to a preferential loss of dopami-
nergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) (Damier
et al., 1999). While the majority of PD cases are sporadic,
approximately 10% of cases (Verstraeten et al., 2015) are
explained by the dysregulation of proteins including
PARKIN (PARK2) (Kitada et al., 1998; Mizuno et al., 2008),
PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1 or PARK6) (Valente
et al., 2004), a-synuclein (PARK1/4) (Polymeropoulos et al.,
1997), and leucine-rich repeat serine/threonine protein ki-
nase 2 (LRRK2 or PARK8) (Funayama et al., 2002; Zimprich
et al., 2004). These forms of familial PD have been
providing important insights into the pathogenesis of PD
and have opened up new areas of investigation. For
example, PD-related genes such as PINK1 (PARK6) and
PARKIN (PARK2) are involved in mitochondrial homeosta-
sis and stress responses (Du et al., 2017; Kalia and Lang,
2015; Narendra et al., 2012). PARK1/4 is involved in a-syn-
uclein accumulation, which is the pathological feature of
PD (Kalia and Lang, 2015), and PARK8 has also been re-
ported to be associated with impaired autophagy. However,
the findings obtained from cellular models and animal
models do not always accurately reflect the pathogenesis
of PD patients due to different cellular contexts or vulnera-
bility to disease-relevant mutations (Blesa and Przedborski,
2014). Therefore, despite these advances, no effective ther-
apeutic treatments have been developed.
The recent progress of human induced pluripotent stem
cell (iPSC)-assisted technology presents new opportunities
for disease modeling based on precise cellular contexts,
which had previously been difficult to obtain, especially
in neurodegenerative disorders (Okano and Yamanaka,
2014). In the case of PD, patient-derived iPSCs would be a
direct source for midbrain DA neurons, a disease-relevant
cell type. Accordingly, there has been a series of studies
demonstrating disease-relevant phenotypes using PD-
derived iPSCs (Drouin-Ouellet and Barker, 2012). Although
these studies have elegantly demonstrated disease-related
phenotypes, a more efficient protocol to generate DA
neurons from patient-derived iPSCs would lead to the
identification of mechanisms whereby PD patients develop
DA-neuron-specific phenotypes.
Here, we developed an efficient directed differentiation
protocol to generate DA neurons with less variation of effi-
cacy than previous protocols (Imaizumi et al., 2012; Ren
et al., 2015; Shaltouki et al., 2015). We used PARK2 pa-
tient-specific and isogenic PARK2 null (PARK2�/�) iPSC-
derived DA neurons (PARK2-DA neurons and PARK2�/�-
DA neurons, respectively) for in vitro disease modeling
and found that these neurons exhibited neurite abnormal-
ities, elevated oxidative stress, and apoptosis. We also per-
formed a phenotypic screening to identify neuroprotective
compounds and identified benidipine, a voltage-gated cal-
cium channel antagonist, as a potential chemical targeting

 PD. Importantly, we found that the selective vulnerability
of DA neurons to rotenone-induced stress in PARK2 was
attributable to the dysregulation of intracellular calcium
homeostasis via T-type calcium channels. In summary, we
have established a robust platform to model PD in a dish
and revealed an additional layer of the pathogenesis of
PD, offering a potential therapeutic target.
RESULTS
Characterization of Dopaminergic Neurons Derived
from PARK2 Patient-Specific and Isogenic PARK2�/�
iPSC Lines
In an attempt to identify the chemical compounds for PD,
we developed an efficient directed differentiation protocol
to establish an in vitro disease model using PD patient-spe-
cific iPSC-derived DA neurons (Figure 1A). As a feature of
this protocol, it is possible to use cryopreserved neural pro-
genitor cells (NPCs), which enables us to perform stable dif-
ferentiation induction, reproducible disease phenotypic
analysis, and compound screening in a large number of
cells with a uniform frozen cell lot. As an entry point,
NPCs were generated from the iPSCs established from
two PARK2 patients, PA and PB (Figure 1B). For comparison,
NPCs derived from control iPSCs were also used (Figure 1B).
In addition, iPSC-NPCs derived from a PARK2�/� iPSC line
(B7PA21) were also generated to evaluate the disease-rele-
vant phenotypes in the same genetic background (Figures
1B and S1). We initially examined the cellular properties
after the differentiation of iPSC-NPCs toward midbrain
DA neurons. As shown in Figure 1C, the efficiency of
neuronal differentiation was assessed on differentiation
day 14 by the number of cells positive for neuronal markers
including bIII-tubulin and microtubule-associated protein
2 (MAP2); bIII-tubulin+ neurons constituted approximately
84% of the total cells among all the lines. In our protocol,
there were very few glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)+
cells, indicating that astrocytic differentiation was negli-
gible. Importantly, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)+ neurons
constituted more than 40% of the bIII-tubulin+ neurons
(Figure 1C). The proportions of bIII-tubulin+ TH + neurons
to the total population did not change significantly be-
tween PARK2 patient lines and control lines, indicating
the consistency of DA neuron generation in our protocol.
We further characterized TH+ neurons with midbrain
markers, including forkhead box protein A2 (FOXA2),
engrailed-1 (EN1), nur-related factor 1 (NURR1), and
G-protein-activated inward rectifier potassium channel 2
(GIRK2) (Hartfield et al., 2014; Xi et al., 2012), further con-
firming the production of dopamine on day 14 by immu-
nocytochemical analysis (Figure 1D). Because we detected
electrophysiological activity in the neurons on day 14 by
recording using an Axion MEA system (Figures S2A–S2E),
we extended our analysis to demonstrate the functional
properties of the neurons by measuring dopamine release.
To demonstrate the functional properties of these DA
neurons, we measured dopamine release by ELISA. We
found that the amount of spontaneous dopamine release
was increased during neuronal differentiation (Figure 1E).

 Furthermore, no difference was observed between the
DA neurons derived from a control line (Cont A) and a
PARK2 line (PB) in regard to dopamine release on day 14
(Figure 1F). Taken together, we could develop an efficient
and robust differentiation protocol for the generation of
midbrain DA neurons from NPCs.
Moreover, given the observed axonal degeneration of DA
neurons of the SN in PD patients (Cheng et al., 2010) and
reduced morphological complexity of iPSC-derived DA neu-
rons from PD patients (Ren et al., 2015), we examined the
neuronal morphology by measuring the neurite length of
DA neurons on day 14 (Figure S2F). As shown in Figure 1G,
the neurons derived from PARK2 iPSC-NPCs exhibited
reduced neuronal processes compared with those of a con-
trol iPSC-NPC line as judged by bIII-tubulin staining. This
phenotype was also observed in the DA neurons derived
from the PARK2�/� iPSC line (Figure 1H), indicating that
the morphological abnormality of the DA neurons was
caused by a mutation in the PARK2 gene. Oxidative stress
plays a key role in the selective degeneration of SN DA neu-
rons in PD (Dias et al., 2013; Du et al., 2018), and we previ-
ously showed the presence of elevated oxidative stress levels
in PARK2 iPSC-derived neurons (Imaizumi et al., 2012).
Therefore, we next investigated whether the oxidative stress
levels were also increased in the PARK2- or PARK2�/�-DA
neurons by using CellROX Green Reagent to measure the
intracellular oxidative stress levels (Figure S2F). The propor-
tion of CellROX+ cells was significantly increased in the
PARK2- and PARK2�/�-DA neurons compared with the con-
trol DA neurons, indicating increased intracellular oxidative
stress levels in the DA neurons in PD (Figures 1I and S2G),
consistent with a previous report (Chung et al., 2016).
We further investigated the cell viability of PARK2- or
PARK2�/�-DA neurons by the expression of cleaved cas-
pase-3 (CASP3), which labels apoptotic cells (Figure S2F).
As shown in Figures 1J, S2H, and S3B, we found a significant
increase in the apoptotic cell population among PARK2-
and PARK2�/�-DA neurons. Although we demonstrated
increased oxidative stress and apoptosis in the PARK2-DA
neurons after the purification of DA neuronal progenitors
using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (Suzuki et al.,
2017), our current procedures enabled us to simplify the dif-
ferentiation steps togenerateDA neurons.Utilizingisogenic
PARK2�/� lines in parallel with patient-derived lines, we
could demonstrate that loss of Parkin function in PD trig-
gered cellular stress and cell death in DA neurons.
PARK2-Dopaminergic Neurons Showed Increased
Susceptibility to Rotenone-Induced Stress
Because it has been reported that mitochondrial respiratory
chain complex I activity is reduced in the brains of PD pa-
tients (Schapira et al., 1989; Winklhofer and Haass, 2010),
we used rotenone, a mitochondrial complex I inhibitor (Du
et al., 2016), to mimic environmental toxicity to mito-
chondria. We speculated that a combination of genetic mu-
tations and environmental toxicity would be important for
developing a disease model to suppress the pathological
progression of PD. Accordingly, we compared the suscepti-
bility of the control and PARK2-DA neurons to the rote-
none treatment. The DA neurons were treated with rote-
none (10 mM) for 3 hr or 24 hr and analyzed for
intracellular oxidative stress and apoptotic cells, respec-
tively. As expected, the rotenone-exposed PARK2-DA neu-
rons exhibited higher oxidative stress levels than the con-
trol DA neurons (Figure 2A). Furthermore, we observed
higher rates of CASP3+ apoptotic DA neurons in the rote-
none-exposed PARK2 lines than in the control lines (Fig-
ure 2B). The enhanced apoptosis in the PARK2-DA neurons
was further evaluated and confirmed by an in situ TUNEL
analysis (Figures S3A and S3B). We also detected the vulner-
ability of the mitochondrial membrane potential among
the rotenone-exposed PARK2-DA neurons (Figure S3C). In
addition, to determine whether the effect of rotenone
was specific to DA neurons, we also performed the same
analysis on TH� bIII-tubulin+ neurons. Interestingly, TH�
neurons
were
less
susceptible
to
rotenone-induced
apoptosis, and there was no significant difference between
the control and patient-derived neurons, indicating selec-
tive susceptibility of the DA neurons to rotenone-induced
stress, which further supports subtype-specific neuronal
loss in PD. In the following analysis, given there is an
increased dynamic range of disease-related phenotypes by
rotenone treatment, we applied the experimental para-
digm to proceed with chemical screening to identify the
compounds that reduce the disease-related phenotypes.
A Calcium Channel Antagonist Prevented Rotenone-
Induced Apoptosis and Rescued Impaired Neurite
Outgrowth in PARK2-Dopaminergic Neurons
To evaluate whether in vitro disease modeling using PARK2-
DA neurons could be used as a system for drug discovery,
we further explored the compounds that reduce the vulner-
ability of DA neurons. To repurpose existing drugs, we con-
ducted an initial screening with an FDA-approved drug li-
brary containing 1,165 compounds (Figure 3A) (Shimizu
et al., 2017). In the initial screening, 88 compounds were
selected because the CASP3 levels in the treated DA neu-
rons were less than 50% of the levels in the neurons treated
with only rotenone (Figure 3B). Then, we classified the
compounds into several subgroups according to their
major pharmacological effects, such as calcium channel
antagonists (CCAs), cardiovascular drugs, and antibiotic/
antiparasitic drugs (Figure S4A). The category of CCAs
was attractive considering the number of confirmed hit
compounds. For example, benidipine (a dihydropyridine
[DHP]-derived triple L-, N-, and T-type CCA) strongly
1174

 reduced rotenone-induced apoptosis (Figure 3C) (Kopecky
et al., 2014; Yao et al., 2006). In addition, cinnarizine
(a phenylpiperazine-derived dual L- and T-type CCA) (Fig-
ure S4B) (Cohen et al., 1992) and amiodarone (a benzo-
furan-derived dual L- and T-type CCA) (Cohen et al.,
1992)
also
displayed
neuroprotective
effects
in
the
PARK2-DA neurons (Figure S4C). Because these com-
pounds exhibited diverse chemical structures while being
categorized in the same category, their neuroprotective ef-
fects seemed to be mechanism dependent. However, nifed-
ipine (a DHP-derived selective L-type CCA) (Curtis and
Scholfield, 2001) and isradipine (a DHP-derived selective
L-type CCA) (Ritz et al., 2010), the same DHP analogs as be-
nidipine, failed to prevent rotenone-induced apoptosis
(Figures S4D and S4E), indicating that the calcium channel
subtype is important for neuroprotective effects against
PARK2-DA neurons. This finding is slightly contradictory
to the previous observation that L-type calcium channels,
especially the CaV1.3 subtype, generate an activity-related
oscillatory calcium burden in SN DA neurons, contributing
to their degeneration and the pathology of PD (Hurley
et al., 2013; Surmeier et al., 2005). Because the presence
of T-type calcium channels in DA neurons remains unclear,
we conducted the analysis using a selective T-type calcium

ML218
(Xiang
et al., 2011). As expected, ML218 sup-
pressed rotenone-induced apoptosis in
the PARK2-DA neurons (Figure 3D). These results indicated
that T-type calcium channels contribute to rotenone-
induced apoptosis in the PARK2-DA neurons. Next, to
confirm whether benidipine is neuroprotective, we investi-
gated its effect on neurite abnormalities in PARK2-DA
neurons and found that benidipine also rescued impaired
neurite outgrowth in PARK2-DA neurons (Figure 3E).
Taken together, the results from our screening system using
PARK2-DA neurons identified some existing drugs that
have potential neuroprotective effects as well as new candi-
date therapeutic target pathways.

Neuroprotective Effects against Dopaminergic
Neurons Derived from a PARK6 Patient-Specific
iPSC Line
To further validate the effect of benidipine on PD patient-
derived DA neurons, we examined its effect on the DA
neurons generated from different PD patient-derived DA
neurons. We utilized a different form of familial PD with
a mutation of PARK6. PARK6 encodes PINK1, a mitochon-
dria-targeted kinase thought to play an important role in
mitochondrial homeostasis together with PARKIN (Seibler
et al., 2011). Importantly, the DA neurons derived from

 PARK6 patient-specific iPSCs were reported to display
several PD phenotypes, including cell-type-specific vulner-
ability and mitochondrial dysfunction (Chung et al.,
2016). We generated NPCs from PARK6 patient-specific
iPSCs (Shiba-Fukushima et al., 2017) and differentiated
them into DA neurons. The PARK6 iPSC-NPCs were also
competent with differentiation toward DA neurons, and
the PARK6 iPSC-NPC-derived DA neurons (PARK6-DA neu-
rons) displayed several markers of DA neurons (Figure 4A).
As observed in the PARK2-DA neurons, the PARK6-DA neu-
rons displayed shortened neurite lengths and elevated
oxidative stress levels compared with the control DA neu-
rons (Figures 4B and 4C). Furthermore, the rotenone treat-
ment also enhanced the oxidative stress levels and
apoptosis in the PARK6-DA neurons (Figures 4C and 4D),
indicating that disease-specific phenotypes could also be
reconstructed in DA neurons derived from PARK6 iPSC
lines. Finally, we examined the neuroprotective effects of
benidipine on PARK6-DA neurons; we found that benidi-
pine protected the DA neurons from rotenone-induced
stress in a concentration-dependent manner (Figure 4E)
and rescued impaired neurite outgrowth (Figure 4F). Taken
together, our results show that the neuroprotective effect of
benidipine on PD-derived DA neurons was highly specific
to disease-relevant abnormality in PD patients.
Dysregulation of Calcium Homeostasis in PARK2-
Dopaminergic Neurons Was Suppressed by Selective
T-type Calcium Channel Inhibition
Considering the function of benidipine, it is likely that
the dysregulation of cellular calcium homeostasis might
result in the vulnerability of DA neurons in PD. Previous
works in mouse SN DA neurons have shown that T-type
calcium channels are present and functionally important
(Dufour et al., 2014; Simms and Zamponi, 2014). Therefore,
we examined the expression of the voltage-gated calcium
channel in DA neurons. Interestingly, we observed higher
expression of the T-type calcium channels (CaV3.1,
CaV3.2, and CaV3.3) in PARK2-DA neurons than in control
DA neurons (Figures 5A and S5A). We then utilized the cal-
cium indicator dye Fluo-8 AM to examine the intracellular
calcium levels in PARK2-derived neurons. As shown in Fig-
ure 5B, the neurons derived from the PARK2 iPSC lines had
increased resting calcium levels compared with the control
line (PARK2 including PB and PA, 174% increase compared
with the control; *p < 0.05 by an unpaired t test, n = 4–8 in-
dependent biological replicates). In addition, we observed
significantly increased intracellular calcium levels in the
rotenone-treated PARK2 iPSC lines (Figure 5B). Further-
more, benidipine and ML218 inhibited rotenone-induced
intracellular calcium increases in the PARK2-derived neu-
rons (Figure 5C), indicating that T-type calcium channels
contribute to the dysregulation of calcium homeostasis in
PARK2-DA neurons. To gain insight into the functional
role of T-type calcium channels, we performed a loss-of-
function analysis using small interfering RNAs (siRNAs)
against T-type calcium channels and examined their effects
on DA neurons. Initially, we examined the expression level
of mRNA and protein of each channel after the introduc-
tion of siRNAs into the DA neurons and found reduced
expression of each subunit of the channel in the DA neu-
rons (Figures 5D and S5C). Then, we introduced the siRNA
into the PARK2-DA neurons, exposed them to rotenone,
and assessed their intracellular calcium levels using Fluo-8
AM. Wefound that knockdown ofany individualT-type cal-
cium channel subtype resulted in a tendency todecrease the
calcium levels (Figure S5E). In addition, immunocytochem-
ical analysis for CASP3 revealed that knockdown of T-type
calcium channels suppressed rotenone-induced apoptosis
in the PARK2-DA neurons (Figure 5E). These phenotypes
were also observed in the DA neurons derived from the
PARK2�/� iPSC line (Figures S5B, S5D, and 5F). To further
validate our findings about the dysregulated expression of
T-type calcium channels, we overexpressed T-type calcium
channels (CaV3.1 and CaV3.3) into control DA neurons
to examine whether a dysregulated intracellular calcium

 concentration triggers PD-like phenotypes in the control
DA neurons. Interestingly, the overexpression of T-type
calcium channels triggered increased susceptibility of the
DA neurons to rotenone-induced stress (Figures S5F–S5H).
These results suggest that the selective vulnerability of DA
neurons to rotenone-induced stress in PARK2 was attribut-
able to the dysregulation of intracellular calcium homeo-
stasis via the T-type calcium channels.
DISCUSSION
Because various therapeutic strategies have failed to yield
a promising treatment for the disease processes of PD
(Athauda and Foltynie, 2015), it is important to establish
model systems for developing more effective therapeutic
interventions; such systems would be a bridge between an-
imal models and human patients. A postmortem analysis
is informative regarding the end-stage pathology of PD,
but understanding the early molecular changes associated
with the initiation of PD is required to develop improved
therapies to halt the progression of the disease. A model
system that faithfully reflects the pathogenesis of PD would
support the development of more effective therapies. In
this respect, PD patient-derived iPSCs represent a useful
tool for in vitro disease modeling. In parallel with the anal-
ysis using isogenic PARK2�/� iPSCs (Figures 1 and S1), we
established a robust and well-controlled in vitro culture

 system and demonstrated several PD-related phenotypes,
including neurite abnormalities, elevated oxidative stress,
and apoptosis in PARK2- and PARK2�/�-DA neurons (Fig-
ures 1, S2, and S3B). Although several PD-related pheno-
types have been reported in PARK2 iPSCs (Imaizumi
et al., 2012; Ren et al., 2015; Shaltouki et al., 2015), the fre-
quency of DA neurons within the entire neuronal popula-
tion in these studies is either unmentioned or less than
15%. In contrast, we have successfully generated DA neu-
rons from iPSC lines, and the DA neurons further exhibited
midbrain regional specificity and dopamine production
(Figure 1). Recently, we also reported a method for prepar-
ing highly enriched DA neurons using fluorescence-
activated cell sorting (Suzuki et al., 2017), but the current
procedure is more advanced in terms of simplicity and
robustness for neuronal differentiation, enabling us to
perform screening without complicated work.
Notably, we further extended our study to screen CCAs
based on their effects on rotenone-treated PARK2-DA neu-
rons (Figures 3 and S4). It is noteworthy that selectivity for
calcium channel subtypes may be associated with differ-
ences in neuroprotective effects in different DHP analogs,
such as benidipine, nifedipine, and isradipine. We also vali-
dated the results obtained from PARK2-DA neurons in the
DA neurons derived from PARK6 iPSCs (Figure 4). Mecha-
nistically, loss-of-function mutations in PARK2 or PARK6
have been associated with mitochondrial dysfunction,
including reduced ATP production, impaired mitochon-
drial autophagy, mitophagy, and disruption of intracellular
calcium homeostasis (Chung et al., 2016; Scarffe et al.,
2014). Mitochondria are important temporal and spatial
regulators
of
intracellular
calcium
concentrations
in
neurons, and mitochondrial dysfunction triggers mito-
chondrial permeability transition pore opening via high
mitochondrial calcium levels and mitochondrial depolari-
zation. The opening of pores releases apoptotic factors
and leads to apoptosis (Cali et al., 2012). In the present
report, we observed selective upregulation of T-type cal-
cium channels in PARK2-DA neurons. Regarding the rela-
tionship between calcium channels and PD pathogenesis,
SN DA neurons are reported to be autonomous pacemakers
that fire action potentials in the absence of excitatory syn-
aptic input; this pacemaker activity is mainly regulated by
the L-type calcium channel CaV1.3, as revealed by an ani-
mal model (Surmeier et al., 2005). This function is consis-
tent with the potential beneficial effect of certain CCAs—
specifically, inhibitors of L-type calcium channels—against
PD, as revealed by etiological observations in patients using
CCAs as an antihypertensive intervention (Ritz et al.,
2010). Although the potential neuroprotective role of isra-
dipine has been reported (Surmeier et al., 2010, 2017), the
plasma concentration of isradipine approved for therapy
has been reported to be insufficient for the treatment of a
PD animal model (Ortner et al., 2017). Furthermore, only
modest advantages were achieved in a recent clinical trial
(STEADY-PD) (Parkinson Study, 2013). Therefore, the effi-
cacy of isradipine remains controversial, and the results
of an ongoing phase 3 clinical trial (STEADY-PD III) are
awaited to reach a definitive conclusion about its effective-
ness against PD (Surmeier et al., 2017). On the other hand,
at least in our experimental model, the dysregulation of
L-type calcium channels is less likely to contribute to
the pathogenesis of PD. Furthermore, Evans et al. (2017)
showed, using mouse brain slices, that SN DA neurons
negative for the calcium buffering protein calbindin are
highly vulnerable compared with calbindin+ SN neurons.
In addition, calbindin� DA neurons have a higher density
of T-type calcium channels than calbindin+ DA neurons.
However, because of the limited availability of suitable
models, there is no direct evidence linking selective vulner-
ability with T-type calcium channels in the PD brain to
date. Therefore, iPSC-based disease modeling provides a
versatile in vitro system to evaluate the pathogenesis of
neurodegenerative disease. One might wonder about the
validity of the concentration of the compound we applied
in our experiment compared with the clinical dosage of the
compound. As the neuroprotective dose of benidipine
(50% inhibitory concentration [IC50] = 1.1 mM; 95% confi-
dence interval, 0.2 to 6.7 mM; n = 9 independent biological
replicates) in the rotenone-exposed cell-based assay was
found to be similar to the therapeutic range of this drug
in clinical use (3.7–7.4 mM as an antihypertensive) (Ko-
pecky et al., 2014), this compound may be suitable for
new therapeutic purposes, such as PD treatment, and
T-type CCAs are strong candidates for disease-modifying
drugs that can alleviate the progressive pathology of PD
(Figure 6). Although we utilized DA neurons from PAKR2
and PARK6 iPSCs, we cannot rule out the possibility
that the neuroprotective effect of benidipine is specific
to DA neurons with an abnormal PINK1-PARKIN pathway.
Furthermore,
in
our
experimental
model
for
drug
screening, we utilized rotenone to enhance the disease-
related phenotypes. Enhancement of the in vitro pheno-
type was also achieved in other chemical compounds
such
as
carbonyl
cyanide
m-chlorophenylhydrazone
(CCCP), an uncoupler that is known to dissipate mito-
chondrial membrane potential and induced entry of extra-
cellular
calcium
through
L/N-type
calcium
channels
(Gomez-Sanchez et al., 2014). Similar to the effects of rote-
none, we observed an increased proportion of TH+ neurons
co-expressing CASP3, and CCCP-induced cell death was
suppressed by the addition of benidipine (Figure S6). There-
fore, future research will clarify the effect of benidipine
on other types of PD patient-derived DA neurons.
Because dysregulated mitochondrial function occurs
ubiquitously in the PD brain, additional cell-intrinsic
1180

 circumstances in midbrain DA neurons might determine
cell-type-specific vulnerability, triggering selective death
of DA neurons in PD patients. For example, transcriptional
regulation of T-type calcium channels in DA neurons is of
interest based on our findings that the PARK2-DA neurons
expressed more T-type calcium channels (Figures 5 and S5).
In contrast with increased intracellular calcium levels after
rotenone treatment (Figure 5B), the mRNA level of calcium
channels did not change after rotenone treatment, indi-
cating that transcriptional regulation is less likely to
contribute to dysregulated intracellular calcium levels in
PARK2-DA neurons. Because there is limited information
to date on the regulation of those channels, we would
like to address this matter experimentally in our future
studies. Given that the dysregulation of calcium homeosta-
sis plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of several neuro-
degenerative diseases, including PD (Bezprozvanny, 2010;
Surmeier et al., 2010), Alzheimer disease (Bezprozvanny,
2010; Magi et al., 2016), Huntington disease (Bezproz-
vanny, 2010; Kolobkova et al., 2017), and amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis (Bezprozvanny, 2010; Leal and Gomes,
2015), it would be important to unravel the contribu-
tion of dysregulated calcium channels in these diseases
and how a dysregulated calcium concentration triggers
selective neuronal deaths in other types of neuronal
subsets.
In summary, our study indicates that PARK2-DA neurons
provide an in vitro disease model that recapitulates several
PD-related disease phenotypes; this model can be used to
investigate the pathogenesis of the disease and search for
potential therapeutic targets for PD.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
A detailed description of the experimental procedures is given in
the Supplemental Information.
Generation of Patient-Specific and Isogenic iPSC-
Derived Neural Progenitor Cells
The iPSC line 201B7 (Takahashi et al., 2007), PARK2 iPSC lines
PA9 and PB2 (Imaizumi et al., 2012), PARK2-deficient iPSC lines
(B7PA21) (Suda et al., 2018), and PARK6 iPSC line PKB3 (Shiba-
Fukushima et al., 2017) were established and maintained as previ-
ously described. The NPCs were established from the 201B7, PA9,

Stress in PARK2
Schematics of calcium homeostasis dysregulation in PARK2-DA neurons. When normal DA neurons were exposed to rotenone,
damaged mitochondria were removed by Parkin- and PINK1-mediated mitophagy, allowing normal function to be maintained.
However, mitochondrial function could not be restored due to the abnormality of the mitochondrial quality control mechanism in
rotenone-exposed PARK2-DA neurons. Therefore, intracellular calcium overload promoted mitochondrial dysfunction and caused cell
death specifically in DA neurons. Selective inhibition of T-type calcium channels suppressed the increase in intracellular calcium levels and
cell death.

 PB2, PKB3, and B7PA21 iPSC lines as previously described (Falk
et al., 2012).
Compound Screening
We used an FDA-approved drug library consisting of 1,165 biolog-
ically active compounds (Shimizu et al., 2017). The PARK2-DA
neurons were incubated for 48 hr in the absence or presence of
each compound (10 mM); subsequently, rotenone (10 mM) treat-
ment was conducted for 24 hr (Figure 3A).
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 7.0
(GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA). The data are described as the
means ± standard error of the mean (SEM). Unpaired t tests were
used for pairwise comparisons between the groups. One-way anal-
ysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Dunnett’s test and two-way
ANOVA followed by either Tukey’s test or a t test with Sidak’s
correction were applied for multiple comparisons. The results
were considered statistically significant when p < 0.05. The IC50
was also calculated using GraphPad Prism.
Ethics
All the experimental procedures were approved by the Keio Uni-
versity School of Medicine Ethics committee (Approval Number:
20080016).
