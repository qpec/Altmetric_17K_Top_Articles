Abstract
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is currently incurable, but there is
general agreement that a minimally invasive blood biomarker for
screening in preclinical stages would be crucial for future ther-
apy. Diagnostic tools for detection of AD are either invasive like
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers or expensive such as posi-
tron emission tomography (PET) scanning. Here, we determine
the secondary structure change of amyloid-b (Ab) in human
blood. This change used as blood amyloid biomarker indicates
prodromal AD and correlates with CSF AD biomarkers and
amyloid PET imaging in the cross-sectional BioFINDER cohort. In
a further population-based longitudinal cohort (ESTHER), the
blood biomarker detected AD several years before clinical diagno-
sis in baseline samples with a positive likelihood ratio of 7.9; that
is, those who were diagnosed with AD over the years were 7.9
times more likely to test positive. This assay may open avenues
for blood screening of early AD stages as a funnel for further
more invasive and expensive tests.

Introduction
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a brain disorder whose hallmarks are
amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (Blennow et al, 2006;
Zhao et al, 2012; Wang & Mandelkow, 2016). It is believed that up
to 15–20 years prior to clinical symptoms of AD (Bateman et al,
2012; Rowe et al, 2013), the secondary structure of amyloid-b (Ab)
peptides alters its folds from “healthy” disordered or a-helical to
“pathological”
b-sheet-enriched
secondary
structures
(Sarroukh
et al, 2011). Such b-sheet-enriched structures aggregate and can
form soluble toxic oligomers, seeds, and finally macroscopically
visible amyloid plaques, which are thought to contribute to AD
neurodegeneration (Cavallucci et al, 2012; Zhao et al, 2012; Jucker &
Walker, 2013). Hence, research diagnostic criteria in AD recommend
the use of biomarkers of amyloidosis (McKhann et al, 2011; Sperling
et al, 2011; Jack et al, 2016). Established amyloid biomarkers are
Ab-binding ligands used in positron emission tomography (PET), a
costly and time-consuming technique, and assays to measure Ab42,
total-tau (ttau) and phosphor-tau (ptau) in cerebrospinal fluid, which
require an invasive procedure (Blennow et al, 2015).
Recently,
we
developed
an
immuno-infrared-sensor
(WO
2015121339 A1) that monitored the secondary structure change of
Ab peptides. The sensor is an antibody-based (immuno) method to
extract all Ab peptides from CSF and blood samples and spectro-
scopically senses the secondary structure distribution of extracted
soluble Ab peptides in the infrared (Fig 1A; Nabers et al, 2016a,b).
As compared to established ELISA tests for Ab detection, the
immuno-infrared-assay does not measure the absolute biomarker
concentration but the frequency shift in the infrared as a relative
measure. Thus, the relative measurements are in principal more
robust against concentration fluctuations caused by biological
variances.
We showed that the change in the Ab peptides secondary struc-
ture is a reliable blood biomarker for severe AD stages (Nabers
et al, 2016a). As expected, AD patients at these stages showed
an overall shift to b-sheet-enriched secondary structures. The
immuno-infrared-sensor specifically extracts all soluble Ab forms
from blood plasma under physiological conditions independent of

 the respective secondary structure. The read-out is the frequency
of the secondary structure-sensitive amide I absorbance band,
which reflects the average secondary structure distribution of all
soluble Ab forms (see Fig 1A). In b-sheet conformations, compris-
ing diverse oligomeric and (pre-) fibrillary Ab species, the amide I
band is downshifted relative to a-helical or disordered monomeric
isoforms (Fig 1A). The relative small amide I band of Ab is eluci-
dated from the large background absorbance by difference spec-
troscopy (Garczarek & Gerwert, 2006; Nabers et al, 2016a,b). An
experimentally
determined
threshold
frequency
separates
the
amide I marker band in b-sheet-enriched species from unfolded
and
a-helical
isoforms
(schematically
shown
in
Fig 1A).
In
summary, if the maximum position of the marker band shifts
below
the
threshold,
it
indicates
AD,
because
the
average
secondary
structure
distribution
is
shifted
towards
b-sheet-
enriched species.
In a previous cross-sectional clinical study (Nabers et al,
2016a) that included neurochemical markers from cerebrospinal
fluid (CSF) (such as Ab(40), Ab(42), Ab(42/40), phospho-tau,
total-tau), the sensor was applied to 141 patients with moderate-
to-severe AD stages. In the previous study, the immuno-infrared-
assay showed a sensitivity of 94% and a specificity of 88% for
CSF analyses. However, even more interesting it showed a sensi-
tivity of 75%, and a specificity of 88% for blood plasma analyses
(Nabers et al, 2016a). This demonstrated that the Ab secondary
structure change could be used as a blood biomarker for severe
AD stages.
Results
The amyloid-b secondary structure distribution in blood plasma
of prodromal AD (BioFINDER)
Since the structural change of Ab is proposed to take place 15–
20 years before clinical onset, here, we investigated whether this
marker band downshift below the threshold could also serve as a
blood biomarker to identify early AD stages.
In order to answer these questions, we first studied whether the
Ab secondary structure distribution was altered in plasma during
the
prodromal
stages of
AD. From
the
prospective Swedish
BioFINDER study, we included 36 participants with prodromal AD,
that is, non-demented patients with mild cognitive impairment
(MCI) that had abnormal amyloid [18F]-flutemetamol PET scans, as
well as 37 cognitively healthy controls that had normal amyloid PET
scans (Fig 1B). In the original study design, 40 prodromal AD cases
versus 40 cognitively healthy were planned, but four and three
samples, respectively, showed an insufficient performance, and
thus, sample analysis was not possible. All plasma samples
collected from the subjects of the BioFINDER study were analysed
using the immuno-infrared-sensor (samples were blinded). The
amide I biomarker band was significantly lower (P < 0.001) in cases
with prodromal AD compared with the control group (Fig 2A).
However, the average amide I downshift is not as large as in the
severe state, indicating less enrichment of b-sheet as expected for
this very early state. Using the diagnostic threshold of 1,642 cm�1,

Schematic overview of the immuno-infrared-sensor, the assay read-out, and BioFINDER and ESTHER study design.
A
The immuno-infrared-sensor simultaneously monitors the secondary structure distribution of all soluble Ab peptides in blood plasma caught by monoclonal
antibodies (mAb) covalently attached to the sensor surface (schematic simplified representation; mAb A8978 is raised against the middle epitope (aa13–28) of Ab). If
the marker band (amide I) is dominated by disordered or a-helical monomeric isoforms, the patients would be diagnosed as non-AD (blue). If b-sheet isoforms are
enriched (red), the amide I signal is shifted below the threshold (1,642 cm�1), indicating AD.
B
Plasma samples from the cross-sectional study (BioFINDER) were measured with the immuno-infrared-sensor and used to differentiate between 37
healthy elderly people (all PET negative) and 36 prodromal AD (MCI) patients (all PET positive). The clinical record of participants within this
cohort comprised cognitive testing, CSF biomarker assessment, other clinical measures, 3 Tesla MRI, genetics, epidemiology and [18F]-flutemetamol PET
scanning.

Nested case–control study based on the ESTHER cohort study as of January 2016. Baseline blood plasma samples from the year 2000–2002 were measured in the
same way as samples from the BioFINDER cohort. AD = Alzheimer’s disease; VD = vascular dementia; MD = mixed dementia are investigated. Other dementia forms
include frontotemporal dementia and other dementias. GPs = general practitioners; yr = year; FU = follow-up. The number of randomly selected controls and

 the controls and prodromal AD subjects in the BioFINDER study
were differentiated with a sensitivity of 69% and specificity of 86%.
An AUC of 0.78 (0.68–0.88, 95% CI) was calculated for the differenti-
ation between prodromal AD cases and controls (Fig 3A). This
shows that the blood biomarker is also able to differentiate between
early stages of Alzheimer’s disease and cognitively healthy individu-
als. However, the performance is not as good as for severe stages
with sensitivity of 75%, and a specificity of 88%. The performance
might be improved significantly in the future by using an optimised
antibody for the assay as preliminary experiments have been shown.
Further, the amide I frequency of Ab in plasma samples showed
significant correlations with the levels of CSF AD markers in
the BioFINDER study: Ab(42) (P-value = 4 × 10�4, rs = 0.401),
Ab(42/40) ratio (P = 4 × 10�4, rs = 0.407), total-tau (P = 8 × 10�4,
rs = �0.382), phospho-tau (P = 0.146, rs = �0.172).
The [18F]-flutemetamol standardised uptake value ratio (SUVR)
of a cortical composite region correlated significantly with the
IR-marker band in the plasma (P = 5 × 10�4, rs = �0.397397;
Fig EV1). Figure 4 illustrates the correlation between the [18F]-
flutemetamol PET image and the infrared amide I band for a control
and a prodromal AD subject.
All neurochemical and demographic data of the 73 BioFINDER
participants are summarised in Appendix Table S2.
Thus, we were able to correlate our plasma biomarker with
neurochemical biomarkers and amyloid PET scans. The sensitivity
and specificity obtained in blood were lower than those obtained in
CSF (Fig 3B), and this currently prevents the employment of the
blood test as a stand-alone diagnostic instrument, but it might allow
its use in a two-stage screening process including a combination of
the amyloid blood biomarker with neurochemical CSF biomarkers
of AD and/or PET scanning. Moreover, this test might be used in
combination with other blood tests for AD that may become avail-
able in the future and that, ideally, should also focus complemen-
tary
on
tau
filaments,
a
second
hallmark in
AD
(Wang
&
Mandelkow, 2016). Particularly, the blood test could be used to
preselect individuals in early disease stages for additional lumbar
puncture and PET scanning.
The amyloid-b secondary structure distribution in blood plasma
of early state/preclinical AD (ESTHER)
In the next step, we investigated whether this marker band down-
shift below the threshold could also serve as a blood biomarker to
identify AD years before clinical diagnoses in the general popula-
tion. Therefore, we measured plasma samples from a population-
based longitudinal cohort of older adults from Germany (ESTHER

The threshold at 1,642 cm�1 (solid horizontal line) separates AD cases (MCI (PET positive), BioFINDER; AD, ESTHER) from controls (control (PET negative), BioFINDER;

The threshold at 1,642 cm�1 also separates AD cases (for AD, see A) from VD, MD cases and respective controls. Only the AD group demonstrated significantly lower
maxima below the threshold. Therefore, the biomarker band may provide a differential diagnosis. All diagnostic groups differed significantly (P < 0.0001) from the AD
group (ESTHER).

 study) started in the years 2000–2002. In a nested case–control
study approach embedded in the longitudinal ESTHER study (Saum
et al, 2015) and comprising 970 participants (see online methods for
more details), we identified 195 participants diagnosed with demen-
tia during follow-up, and randomly selected approximately four
times as many controls without a dementia diagnosis. These
controls were frequency matched to AD (n = 70), vascular dementia
(VD; n = 85) and mixed dementia (MD; n = 40) cases by baseline
age, sex and educational level (Fig 1b). For this study, we excluded
70 participants with haemolytic plasma samples, 19 cases for whom
the suspected dementia diagnosis could not be confirmed by further
medical records and seven purported controls for whom dementia
diagnosis was later reported. This left 167 cases (65 AD, 66 VD, 36
MD) and 707 controls (247 AD, 311 VD, and 149 MD) for Ab-
analyses (Appendix Table S1).
The ESTHER cohort is a representative cohort not specifically
designed for AD research; hence, diagnoses of AD in this group are
not necessarily supported by invasive CSF biomarkers nor PET scan-
ning (McKhann et al, 2011). However, blood plasma samples used
for the present analyses were collected at baseline (2000–2002),
several years before clinical diagnosis of AD. Diagnoses of AD were
made or confirmed at later stages of the disease in the follow-up
process of this longitudinal study. At these later stages, clinical diag-
noses are more accurate even without neurochemical marker assess-
ment and PET scanning (Beach et al, 2012; Martinelli et al, 2014).
Specifically, mean follow-up time between blood collection and AD
diagnosis was 8 years as listed in detail in the Appendix Table S3.
Also, the carriage of the APOE e4 risk allele for AD in the ESTHER
cohort was much more common in AD cases than in AD controls
(45.8% vs. 21.7%. P-valuev2 test = 0.0002) (Appendix Table S1) and
the risk allele prevalence in AD cases is in agreement with the esti-
mates reported in other German studies on AD [pooled prevalence
estimates for the e4 allele: 53.0% (44.9–61.2) (Ward et al, 2012)].
Mean ages at baseline of AD cases vs. the respective controls were
68.7 vs. 68.5 years. The majority of AD cases and AD controls were
women (61.5% and 62.4%, respectively) and had low levels
(9 years or less) of school education (86.2% and 83.8%, respec-
tively).
The immuno-infrared-sensor extracted the total Ab fraction from
baseline plasma samples from each subject and assayed them in a
blind manner. Values of the amide I biomarker band were signifi-
cantly lower (P < 0.001) for AD cases as compared with the control
group (Fig 2A). This shows that the amide I biomarker was able to
detect AD in individuals without dementia symptoms on average
8 years before clinical diagnosis of AD.
The downward shift below the threshold of the amide I band to
1,641 cm�1 (median 1,641 cm�1) was seen almost exclusively for
AD cases but not for the other dementia forms and controls
(Fig 2B).
This might suggest that the b-folding of Ab does not appear in
the early stage of other dementias like MD or VD. Nevertheless, we
could not exclude some misclassification of MD which might be VD.
These preliminary results, indicating that the blood test might also
discriminate between AD and VD, have to be validated in another
longitudinal AD cohort in whom the diagnosis is additionally con-
firmed by neurochemical markers and PET scanning. To our knowl-
edge, a blood test, which differentiates between AD, VD and MD is
also not available to date.

 discrimination (Fig 3A). A threshold of 1,642 cm�1 yielded a sensi-
tivity of 71% at 91% specificity for AD/AD control differentiation
(22 false positives out of 247 AD controls). The overall diagnostic
accuracy is 86%. The diagnostic performance indicators in ESTHER
(sensitivity, specificity, AUC) were slightly higher and in agreement
within the 95% confidence interval with the BioFINDER study
(Fig 3A). However, in order to estimate the diagnostic evidence of
the prescreening test the likelihood ratios are more appropriate
measures. The positive likelihood ratio (LR+) was determined with
7.9 (ESTHER) indicating that a positive test result occurs about eight
times more frequently for people who develop AD over years
compared to those who do not in the general population. Thus, the
test showed a good diagnostic evidence (Jaeschke et al, 1994) to
identify AD before clinical diagnosis in the general population.
Discussion
The ESTHER results seem to confirm that the test may be used as
preselection funnel in a two-step diagnostics as suggested above for
the BioFINDER study. In a prescreening set-up, individuals with
high risk for AD can be identified by the immuno-infrared-assay,
and in a second step, neurochemical marker assessment and/or PET
scanning may be used in order to increase the specificity. For a two-
step diagnostics, the sensitivity could be increased even to 77% at
the expense of 69% specificity by up-shifting the threshold from
1,642 cm�1 to 1,644 cm�1 (ESTHER). Thus, about 80% of individu-
als could be preselected for further testing, and about 30% of true
negative subjects would wrongly undergo lumbar puncture or PET
scanning. However, a significant number of false-negative subjects
will also develop clinical symptoms over years. As long as there is
no treatment for preclinical AD, our test result has no implications
for these false-negative AD subjects. Focusing on the Ab structural
change as a marker for the early diagnosis of AD has the great
advantage of targeting the molecular pathomechanism of the normal
to AD transition, which is known to initiate up to 20 years before
clinical manifestation of AD (Bateman et al, 2012; Rowe et al,
2013). These characteristics allow us to overcome the shortcomings
of other non-brain-specific blood markers. These include the lack of
a clear understanding of their relationship to earliest AD stages and
the possibility of being influenced by comorbidities which are
common among people with dementia (Fiandaca et al, 2014, 2015;
Henriksen et al, 2014; Mapstone et al, 2014; Zhao et al, 2015;
O’Bryant et al, 2017). Also, the finding that Ab b-folding appears in
the blood could lead to deeper insights into Ab pathophysiology,
including damaged blood–brain barrier and generation of Ab from
cells outside the brain and, possibly, even in comorbidity with other
diseases like diabetes. However, many of the factors that may play a
role in Ab pathophysiology in blood are out of scope of this manu-
script and further studies with the immuno-infrared-sensor should
specifically address this issue in more detail.
A limitation of this blood test is that Ab b-misfolding may be
present in some persons without dementia and be absent in some
AD patients; hence, false positives and false negatives are intrinsic to
amyloid biomarkers (Yang et al, 2012; Fiandaca et al, 2014; Henrik-
sen et al, 2014; Jansen et al, 2015). However, correlations between
Ab plasma tests—either Ab misfolding as shown here or Ab42
decrease (Ovod et al, 2017; Nakamura et al, 2018)—and PET scan-
ning demonstrate that there is a direct link between Ab alterations in
plasma and Ab burden in the brain and that this is not a peripheral
effect. This is a very encouraging result for all future plasma tests.
Nevertheless, the use of the immuno-infrared-sensor as an initial
screening funnel to identify people who should undergo further
diagnostics and eventually take part in clinical trials on therapeutics
targeting Ab misfolding (Sevigny et al, 2016) might already be an
important step forward because subjects with early AD stages are
hard to identify. To our knowledge, there is today no other plasma
test available, which has been tested both in an AD research cohort
and in the general population.
In order to receive clinical utility in the future, the performance of
the immuno-infrared-test has to be improved and the assay needs to
be validated in a multicentre clinical study especially designed for AD
like NIH-ADNI. Therefore, we need to develop an optimised antibody
and standard operating procedures that guarantee a constant and

 increased performance of the assay in a multicentric set-up. Even
though the immuno-infrared-assay was applied to blood plasma from
different cohorts with different sample handling protocols demonstrat-
ing a robust performance, the assay needs to be further validated in
different clinical set-ups to investigate potential effects of sample
handling. For future applications, a standard operation procedure will
also be followed for sample collection. Therewith, the amyloid marker
might be a valuable instrument as a first minimal-invasive and less
costly step to select participants who should undergo more invasive
CSF analyses and costly PET diagnostics. Compared to other blood
tests (Ovod et al, 2017; Nakamura et al, 2018), unique features of this
assay are (i) the label-free detection of the misfolding of Ab in blood
plasma, (ii) the simple procedure, (iii) the low sample volume and
(iv) the low cost. Moreover, we determined the secondary structure
change of Ab in plasma which is a direct measure as compared to
other methods such as ELISA or mass spectrometry which measured
the absence of Ab42 or the ratio between Ab42/40. These methods are
limited to measure the consequences of Ab burden in the brain in CSF
or blood while the immuno-infrared-assay detects the initial misfold-
ing which occurs 15–20 years before clinical manifestation. Thus, the
immuno-infrared-assay has the potential to detect AD earlier than Ab
burden tests.
Furthermore, our results could also be of great value for basic
research since the identified individuals contribute to get a deeper
understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms triggering AD
and might reveal important information by following up individuals
with Ab misfolding over the years.
Promising
effects
have
recently
been
obtained
with
an
immunotherapy treatment of early AD with a monoclonal antibody
against the Ab peptide (Sevigny et al, 2016). The present result
supports the finding that the Ab peptide is crucial in the early onset
of AD and its b-folding provides a possible prescreening instrument
for this onset. While further improvement of this blood assay is
needed, including further generalisation and validation by larger
and well-established Alzheimer’s longitudinal cohorts focusing on
preclinical AD, our immuno-infrared-sensor paves the way towards
a minimal-invasive blood screening assay for early AD and it shows
a novel innovative approach to detect early states of misfolding
diseases, which could be extended in the future to other diseases
like Parkinson’s disease using antibodies against a-synuclein.

Declaration of Helsinki and the Department of Health and Human

The ESTHER epidemiological cohort study
The ESTHER cohort study is a population-based longitudinal study
of older Caucasian adults conducted in the German state of Saarland
in order to assess the chances for early detection and possible
prevention
of
various
chronic
diseases,
including
dementia.
Between July 2000 and December 2002, during routine health
screening examinations (which are offered free of charge every
2 years to adults above age 35 in Germany), the majority of general
practitioners (56%) operating in Saarland recruited 9,949 women
and men aged 50–75 years and provided medical information.
Participants completed standardised self-administered health ques-
tionnaires and provided blood samples, including heparin plasma
samples, which were stored at �80°. Follow-up questionnaires,
medical records, and biological samples were collected after 2, 5, 8,
11, and 14 years. The ESTHER study was approved by the Ethics
Committee of the Medical Faculty of the University of Heidelberg
and of the Physicians’ Board of Saarland, and all participants gave
written informed consent. According to the study protocol, results
of the laboratory analyses, which were conducted in a fully blinded
manner, were not communicated to the study participants.
In 2014–2015, we asked general practitioners to provide us with
detailed information on potential dementia diagnoses (overall and
according to type of dementia), including the medical records of
medical specialists (neurologists, psychiatrists, memory clinics) for
ESTHER participants who had died (n = 1,211) or terminated active
participation in the study due to health reasons (n = 1,244) in order
to identify cases that had developed clinically manifest dementia
since baseline recruitment. We first focused on ESTHER participants
who had dropped out of the cohort upon the assumption that mani-
fest dementia would prevent active participation in cohort studies.
Hence, focusing on participants who were no longer active allowed
for an efficient collection of dementia cases and limited attribution
bias.
As of January 2016, medical information on dementia diagnoses
could be obtained for the majority of participants (n = 1,843), of
whom 212 (11.5%) and 41 (2.2%) were reported to have a certain
or suspected diagnosis of dementia, respectively. Diagnoses of
Alzheimer’s disease (AD), vascular dementia (VD), and mixed
dementia (MD) were explicitly reported for 70, 85, and 40 partici-
pants, respectively; three cases had a diagnosis of frontotemporal
dementia, and for 55 participants, the type of dementia was unspeci-
fied. The exact date of diagnosis of dementia was recorded in total
for 176 (90.3%) AD, VD, and MD cases and, specifically, for 153
(91.6%) AD, VD and MD cases with Ab analysis.
The documents and medical records indicated a large hetero-
geneity in the extent of diagnostic procedures taken for both the
initial and differential diagnoses of dementia. Out of 65 AD cases,
45 (69%) were explicitly referred from general practitioners to a
medical specialist including neurologists, psychiatrists, memory
clinics for dementia diagnosis. While some clinical specialists only
made a diagnosis of AD if neuropsychological testing, clinical symp-
toms, and results from brain imaging techniques were all available,
other specialists relied exclusively on core clinical criteria such as
insidious onset, cognitive decline, amnestic presentation with no
evidence that other pathologies could explain these symptoms
(McKhann et al, 2011). In at least one case, the medical specialist
documented that the patient himself refused to undergo brain imag-
ing. This implies that not all ESTHER patients whose blood samples
were part of our cohort analysis were diagnosed with the same diag-
nostic standard, which reflects routine clinical practice.
Within the ESTHER cohort, we designed a nested case–control
(NCC) study and included all reported AD, VD, and MD cases as of
January 2016, where the response rate of the GPs reached a plateau.
We randomly selected the controls from strata defined by age, sex,
educational level as matching factors (frequency matching), so that
cases and controls were similar with regard to these relevant
confounding factors. In order to increase statistical power, we chose

 more than one control per case, but we did not exceed the 4:1 ratio,
since it has been demonstrated that a further increase of the ratio only
leads to trivial improvements in precision and power (Wacholder
et al, 1992). Controls were selected randomly from the whole ESTHER
cohort using the “surveyselect” procedure included in the statistical
software SAS� version 9.4 (SAS� Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).
Measurement of the APOE genetic polymorphism and availability
of additional medical data among participants of the ESTHER study
also allowed an indirect verification of the correctness of dementia
diagnoses. In fact, the distribution of APOE genetic polymorphism
both among AD cases and among controls is in agreement with other
German studies (Hong et al, 2009; Ward et al, 2012). The high preva-
lence of APOE e4 carriers among AD cases (45.8%) as compared to
AD controls (21.7%), as well as to VD diagnoses and MD diagnoses
(31.6% and 20.6%, respectively), supports the correctness of AD diag-
noses and their differentiation from other forms of dementia. Like-
wise, the high baseline prevalence of history of cardiovascular
diseases among VD cases (25.0%) as compared to VD controls
(12.2%) and AD cases (8.1%) supports the correctness of VD diag-
noses and its differentiation from AD cases (Appendix Table S1).

participants
tracked with an identification number (ID) was sent to the Depart-
ment of Biophysics at the Ruhr-University of Bochum (hereafter, the
“Bochum group”) from the Department of Clinical Epidemiology
and Aging Research (DKFZ) located in Heidelberg (hereafter, the
“Heidelberg group”). The link between identification number and
dementia status as collected over the follow-up period of the
ESTHER study was only known to the members of the Heidelberg
group, who were not involved in the Ab analysis, but not to the
Bochum group, who performed the analysis. The assay was there-
fore performed in a blinded manner solely by the Bochum group. At
the termination of the Ab analysis, the Bochum group sent to the
Heidelberg group a file that included the value of the amide I
biomarker band for each ID number. Only at this point did the
Heidelberg group disclosed to the Bochum group the link between
ID numbers and dementia status.
The BioFINDER study
The BioFINDER study, similarly to the ESTHER study, strictly followed
study protocols that were carefully examined and fully approved by
the responsible ethics boards and, specifically, by the Regional Ethics
Committee in Lund, Sweden. Written informed consent was obtained
from all study participants and/or their relatives. The study population
stemmed from the prospective and longitudinal Swedish BioFINDER
study where participants were recruited at three memory outpatient
clinics in Sweden between 2010 and 2014 (further information is avail-
able at: www.biofinder.se). Briefly, clinical assignment of MCI and
cognitively healthy people was performed after patient recruitment at
baseline based on cognitive testing, other clinical measures such as
Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), functional activities
questionnaire (FAQ), or Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale
(UPDRS), CSF biomarkers (e.g. Ab(42), total-tau, phospho-tau), MRI/
CT, PET, genetics (e.g. APOE genotype) and epidemiological factors
(e.g. family history, education, diabetes, depression). Forty cognitively
healthy elderly, who were amyloid ([18F]-flutemetamol) PET negative,
and 40 non-demented patients with mild cognitive impairment, who
were amyloid PET positive, were included in the present study. The
research subjects were thoroughly assessed for their cognitive
complaints by physicians with special interest in dementia disorders.
The inclusion criteria for mild cognitive impairment were as follows:
(i) objective cognitive impairment; (ii) not fulfilling the criteria for
dementia; (iii) a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score of 24–
30 points; (iv) age 60–80 years; and (v) fluent in Swedish. The exclu-
sion criteria were as follows: (i) cognitive impairment that without
doubt could be explained by a condition other than prodromal demen-
tias; (ii) severe somatic disease; and (iii) refusing lumbar puncture or
neuropsychological investigation. Cognitively normal controls were
recruited from the population-based Malmo
¨
Diet Cancer study.
Subjects were eligible for inclusion if they (i) were aged ≥ 60 years
old, (ii) scored 28–30 points on the Mini-Mental State Examination
(MMSE) at the screening visit, (iii) did not have cognitive symptoms
as evaluated by a physician, (iv) were fluent in Swedish, (v) did not
fulfil the criteria of MCI or any dementia. The exclusion criteria were
as follows: (i) presence of significant neurologic or psychiatric disease
(e.g. stroke, Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, major depres-
sion), (ii) significant systemic illness making it difficult to participate,
(iii) refusing lumbar puncture and (iv) significant alcohol abuse. In
the present study, we only included cognitively healthy cases with
normal [18F]-flutemetamol PET scans, as well as MCI cases with
abnormal PET scans (see below). For both diagnostic groups, 40
subjects that fulfilled these criteria were randomly selected from the
total sample collective and sent to Bochum. Therefrom, 37 healthy
controls and 36 prodromal AD cases could be successfully analysed
with the immuno-infrared-sensor.
Blood and CSF samples were collected on the same day and at
the same time of day (plasma was obtained within 15 min of CSF
sampling) in the year 2010, when the BioFINDER cohort study was
initiated. For plasma collection, blood was drawn into tubes
containing EDTA as an anticoagulant. After centrifugation (2,000 g,
4°C, 10 min), 1 ml of plasma samples was aliquoted into polypropy-
lene tubes and stored at �80°C. The procedure and analysis of the
CSF followed the Alzheimer’s Association Flow Chart for CSF
biomarkers (Blennow et al, 2010). Lumbar CSF samples were
collected at the three centres and analysed according to a standard-
ised protocol (Palmqvist et al, 2014). CSF samples were centrifuged
(2,000 g, 4°C, 10 min) after collection, and 1 ml was aliquoted into
polypropylene tubes followed by storage at �80°C. Both plasma and
CSF underwent one freeze–thaw cycle when 200 ll of samples was
further aliquoted into protein LoBind tubes and then stored at
�80°C pending biochemical analyses.
Laboratory procedures
Secondary structure distribution of Ab in plasma samples (ESTHER and
BioFINDER)
The total Ab fraction was extracted out of 50 ll plasma samples
from AD cases and controls. For ATR-FTIR analyses (attenuated
total reflection Fourier transform infrared), a Vertex 70V FTIR-spec-
trometer (Bruker Optics GmbH, Ettlingen, Germany), equipped with
a liquid N2 cooled mercury cadmium telluride (MCT) detector, and
an external MIR (Middle Infrared) source was used. The ATR unit
(Specac Ltd., Slough, England) was inserted into the sample
compartment of the spectrometer and adjusted to a 45° incidence
angle. The internal sample compartment was purged with dry air
(Purge air generator Model 75-62-12VDC, Parker Hannifin Corp.,

 Haverhill, MA, USA). The set-up was completely automated and
parallelised by in-house developments for a higher throughput as
reported by Nabers et al (2016a) and to maximise the reproducibil-
ity of the sensor performance.
Sensor surface modification was performed as described in detail
previously (Nabers et al, 2016a,b). Briefly, the polished Germanium
internal reflection element [Ge-IRE, Korth Kristalle GmbH, Altenholz
(Kiel), Germany] was incubated with 300 lM NHS-silane (Schartner
et al, 2013), functionalised with 100 ng/ml monoclonal antibody
A8978 (Sigma-Aldrich (Munich, Germany) and saturated with an
1% w/v casein (Sigma-Aldrich) blocking solution. All non-specifi-
cally bound compounds were rinsed out with PBS buffer. The solu-
tions were passed over the IRE surface by a peristaltic pump
(Ismatec Reglo Digital, IDEX Health&Science, Wertheim-Mondfeld,
Germany) with a steady and defined flow of 1 ml/min. Afterwards,
the functionalised Germanium IRE was covered with 50 ll plasma
in a circulating flow (1 ml/min) and rinsed with PBS buffer. The
total volume of the flow-through sensor unit including all connec-
tion tubes was determined as 400 ll. For each plasma sample, a
freshly prepared sensor surface was used. Difference absorbance
spectra of each preparative step were recorded and served as a qual-
itative internal control for the success of each step. The total time
for all preparative steps and Ab analysis amounted to four hours for
six independent samples.
In order to determine the reproducibility of the assay, we investi-
gated freeze–thaw properties of the samples for this study and
repeated measurements of 150-blinded ESTHER samples. The
results showed a high reproducibility of the amide I band of blood
heparin plasma samples (� 1 cm�1) for each participant (Spearman
rank correlation coefficient rs = 0.991).
Before determination of the amide I maximum position, all spec-
tra were baseline corrected and adjusted based on spectral traces of
atmospheric water vapour. A straight horizontal line was passed
through
the
spectra
at
distinct
wavenumbers
(3,970 cm�1,
2,700 cm�1, 1,750 cm�1, 1,485 cm�1, 1,000 cm�1) to provide a
linear baseline to be subtracted from the measured signal. Atmo-
spheric water vapour was removed by scaled subtraction of a refer-
ence spectrum. Additionally, high-frequency noise was adjusted by
a Fourier low-pass filter.
The sensor was functionalised and saturated as described above
for the extraction of the total Ab fraction out of the plasma sample.
The recorded Ab difference spectrum represents the secondary
structure distribution of all Ab isoforms present in the respective
fluid. Pure a-helical Ab absorbs at 1,650 cm�1 and pure b-sheet at
1,624 cm�1 (fig 1 of Nabers et al 2016a). The more b-sheet Ab
isoforms that are immobilised on the probe surface, the larger the
spectral downshift to lower frequencies of the maximum position of
the amide I band (fig S-5 and S-6 of Nabers et al 2016a). Mixed
forms
show
different
absorbance
maxima,
indicative
of
the
secondary structure distribution as outlined in detail in fig S-5 of
Nabers et al (2016a). Thus, the position of the amide I maximum is
indicative of the content of b-sheet-enriched Ab species in the total
Ab fraction. We automatically determined the position of the Ab
amide I band for each patient sample by an in-house procedure
programmed with Matlab 2015A (Mathworks). This results in an
unbiased, label-free, robust, simple method. AD patients show an
increased content of soluble and b-sheet-enriched Ab isoforms
within the total soluble Ab fraction from blood and, in an even more
pronounced manner, from cerebrospinal fluid (fig 2 of Nabers et al,
2016a).
Apoe (ESTHER)
APOE epsilon alleles were determined based on allelic combinations
of the SNPs rs7412 and rs429358 using predesigned TaqMan SNP
genotyping assays (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Genotypes
were analysed in an endpoint allelic discrimination read using the
Bio-RAD CFX Connect System (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA)
in the laboratory of the University of Halle, Department of Psychia-
try, Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics.
CSF analysis (BioFINDER)
CSF Ab42, Ab40 and ttau were analysed using Euroimmun kits
(EUROIMMUN AG, Lu
¨beck, Germany) and ptau using INNOTEST
kit (Fujirebio, Gent, Belgium). All measurements were performed by
board-certified laboratory technicians who were blinded to clinical
data.
Amyloid ([18F]-flutemetamol) PET (BioFINDER)
All 80 study participants from the BioFINDER study underwent
[18F]-flutemetamol PET to visualise cerebral Ab deposition ([18F]-
flutemetamol is approved by the Food and Drug Administration,
and the European Medical Agency). PET/CT scanning of the brain
was conducted with Philips Gemini PET scanners as previously
described (Palmqvist et al, 2014). In brief, sum images taken 90–
110 min post-injection were analysed using NeuroMarQ software
(GE Healthcare). A volume of interest (VOI) template was applied
for the following nine bilateral regions: prefrontal, parietal, lateral
temporal, medial temporal, sensorimotor, occipital, anterior cingu-
late, posterior cingulate/precuneus and a global neocortical compos-
ite region (Lundqvist et al, 2013). The standardised uptake value
ratio (SUVR) was defined as the uptake in a VOI normalised for the
cerebellar cortex uptake. We have previously established [18F]-flute-
metamol SUVR cut-off > 1.42 for abnormally increased Ab deposi-
tion (Dubois et al, 2014). All cognitively healthy study participants
included in the present study had normal [18F]-flutemetamol PET
scans, and all patients studied that had MCI had abnormal [18F]-
flutemetamol PET scans, that is the latter group fulfilled the IWG-2
criteria for prodromal AD (Dubois et al, 2014).

Statistical analysis
ESTHER study
The distribution of the amide I biomarker band was compared
between AD cases and AD controls. Additionally, the amide I band
was also compared between the AD group and each of the other
groups (VD and MD cases; AD, VD, and MD controls). Furthermore,
we combined all of the non-AD groups into a common disease
control group (DC) (Fig EV2). Both diagnostic groups (AD, DC) did

 not show normally distributed amide I maxima. Thus, differences
between groups were tested for statistical significance by a nonpara-
metric Kruskal–Wallis analysis of variance test. Statistical tests were
conducted two-sided at a significance level of 0.05. Significance
levels are denoted as follows: *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.
Discrimination of AD from AD controls and DC was evaluated by
receiver operator characteristics (ROC) curve analysis and quanti-
fied by the area under the curve. For ROC curve analyses, the
threshold was set between 1,630.5 cm�1 and 1,659.5 cm�1, and for
each wavenumber, the sensitivity and specificity were calculated.
Sensitivity and specificity were determined assuming values of the
amide I band below the threshold of 1,642 cm�1 to be indicative for
AD. The classifying threshold of 1,642 cm�1 for AD and DC differen-
tiation was determined based on a randomly selected patient collec-
tive as described in detail in Nabers et al (2016a). In that study, the
performance of different thresholds was tested in repeated cross-
validations and verified with the remaining test-data sets. Based on
30 repetitions, the study revealed 1,642 cm�1 as an optimal thresh-
old for discrimination.
BioFINDER study
The detection, analysis of the amide I distribution and ROC curve
analysis were performed in an identical manner to the ESTHER
cohort analysis as presented above. In addition, the distribution of
the amide I biomarker band was compared between the PET
amyloid-positive prodromal AD (MCI) and the PET amyloid-nega-
tive control group.
Software
Statistical tests, tests for outliers, data preprocessing, receiver oper-
ating characteristic curve analysis and data distribution analysis
were performed using Matlab 2012A, Matlab 2015A (Mathworks)
and Origin 2015 (Origin Laboratories). In this context, built-in and

procedures

The paper explained
Problem
There is general agreement that early diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease
(AD) based on minimal-invasive and cost-effective blood plasma
methods will pave the way for future successful immuno-therapies.
Ab misfolding into b-sheet species occurs up to 20 years before clini-
cal manifestation of AD and causes amyloid plaque formation in the
brain.
Results
We applied an immuno-infrared-sensor that directly and label-free
monitors the Ab secondary structure distribution in blood plasma. The
assay works cost effective, simple and robust with only smallest
amounts of blood plasma. The diagnostic read-out is simply the
secondary structure-sensitive amide I frequency. AD is indicated by a
frequency shift below the experimentally determined threshold. We
applied this assay on baseline blood plasma in two different and
independent cohorts on prodromal AD (BioFINDER, Sweden) and a
population-based longitudinal study (ESTHER, Germany). In these two
cohorts, the assay shows a sensitivity around 70% and a specificity
around 90%. In the BioFINDER study, there was a significant correla-
tion between the secondary structure distribution of Ab in blood
plasma and Ab burden in the brain monitored by [18F]-flutemetamol
positron emissions tomography (PET). Additionally, the Ab misfolding
biomarker showed also significant correlations with standard CSF
biomarkers (Ab42, Ab42/40 ratio, total-tau, phosphor-tau) as already
seen in our former published study on late stage AD. In the ESTHER
study individuals with AD were identified in a nested case control
group in average 8 years before clinical symptoms appeared.
Impact
Unique features of this assay are (i) the label-free detection of the
misfolding of Ab in blood plasma, (ii) the simple procedure, (iii) the
low sample volume and (iv) the low cost. Measuring the initial
misfolding process which occurs 15–20 years before clinical manifes-
tation, the immuno-infrared-assay may have the potential to detect
AD earlier than Ab burden tests. Moreover, there are indications that
the sensor might also differentiate between AD and other dementia
forms. This has to be validated in detail in larger studies. However,
the immuno-infrared-sensor can also be applied to other neurodegen-
erative misfolding diseases such as Parkinson’s disease.
