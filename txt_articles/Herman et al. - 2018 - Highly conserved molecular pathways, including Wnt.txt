In mammals, spinal cord injury (SCI) leads to dramatic losses in neurons and synaptic connections, 
and consequently function. Unlike mammals, lampreys are vertebrates that undergo spontaneous 
regeneration and achieve functional recovery after SCI. Therefore our goal was to determine the 
complete transcriptional responses that occur after SCI in lampreys and to identify deeply conserved 
pathways that promote regeneration. We performed RNA-Seq on lamprey spinal cord and brain 
throughout the course of functional recovery. We describe complex transcriptional responses in 
the injured spinal cord, and somewhat surprisingly, also in the brain. Transcriptional responses to 
SCI in lampreys included transcription factor networks that promote peripheral nerve regeneration 
in mammals such as Atf3 and Jun. Furthermore, a number of highly conserved axon guidance, 
extracellular matrix, and proliferation genes were also differentially expressed after SCI in lampreys. 
Strikingly, ~3% of differentially expressed transcripts belonged to the Wnt pathways. These included 
members of the Wnt and Frizzled gene families, and genes involved in downstream signaling. 
Pharmacological inhibition of Wnt signaling inhibited functional recovery, confirming a critical role 
for this pathway. These data indicate that molecular signals present in mammals are also involved in 
regeneration in lampreys, supporting translational relevance of the model.
A fundamental question in regenerative biology is why some organisms can regenerate their central nervous 
system (CNS), while others cannot1. Unlike mammals, lampreys, fishes, amphibians, and reptiles exhibit robust 
spontaneous regeneration and functional recovery after SCI2–4. The mammalian peripheral nervous system (PNS) 
also regenerates after injury5, and intraspinal neurons in mammals can do so when provided a permissive envi-
ronment, such as a peripheral nerve bridge or growth factors6–9. However, the conserved molecular pathways that 
promote successful regeneration are unclear10.
We therefore set out to identify deeply conserved pro-regenerative pathways by determining the gene expres-
sion changes that occur after SCI in lampreys. The lamprey is a member of an ancient vertebrate lineage that 
diverged from a common ancestor of humans ~550 million years ago11–13. Despite this evolutionary distance, 
recent sequencing of the lamprey genome revealed molecular pathways that are conserved with mammals, 
including genes related to axon guidance and regeneration, synaptic transmission, neural patterning and neu-
rodegeneration12. The organization of the lamprey CNS is highly analogous to human and other jawed verte-
brates14,15. Remarkably, lampreys recover locomotor function (e.g. swimming) within 12 weeks after a complete 
spinal cord transection, which is supported by repair of the spinal lesion, axon regeneration, and synapse forma-
tion16–20 (Video S1). To better understand the molecular pathways supporting successful functional recovery, we 
used RNA-Seq to determine transcriptional profiles in spinal cord of lampreys after SCI. Because many of the

regenerating descending axons extend from cell bodies located in the brain, we also profiled the supraspinal tran-
scriptional responses in order to determine their contributions to the recovery process. We identified complex 
transcriptional responses in both spinal cord and brain throughout the 12 weeks after injury, including a number 
of expression changes mapping to the Wnt pathway, and used pharmacological blockade of Wnt signaling to 
demonstrate its critical importance in functional recovery.
Results
Spinal Cord Regeneration in Lampreys. 
The lamprey CNS contains many homologous structures 
that are shared with mammals, including a tripartite brain and spinal cord with motor and sensory circuits 
(Fig. 1a)14,21–23. Within the spinal cord are ~1200 reticulospinal (RS) axons, originating from somata in the mid-
brain and hindbrain, comprising the major descending pathway for initiating locomotion (Fig. 1a)24. Spinal cord 
transection severs all axons, leading to paralysis below the lesion that typically lasts 1–2 weeks (Fig. 1a,b; Video 
S1)16–20. Over the next 10–12 weeks post injury (wpi), lampreys spontaneously recover nearly normal swim-
ming behaviors, which can be described via a quantitative scoring system, where 1 corresponds to an ability to 
curve into a “C” or “S” shape without translation to forward motion, 2 corresponds to an ability to achieve brief 
abnormal swimming, 3 corresponds to persistent but abnormal swimming and 4 is normal swimming. (Fig. 1b,c; 
Video S1) (n = 25–66 animals per time point; R2 = 0.97; t1/2 = 3.43 ± 0.12 weeks)18,25. Animals that reach stage 4 
are considered to have achieved full functional recovery. This functional recovery is supported by lesion repair, 
regeneration of descending and ascending axons, and proliferation of cells that give rise to new neurons and 
glia16,18,20,26–29. Figure 1d shows the basic cytoarchitecture of the spinal cord during recovery from SCI, as initially 
shown by Rovainen16. Previously, it has been shown that ~50% of RS axons regenerate beyond the lesion and form 
synapses with appropriate postsynaptic targets17,18. In the brain, SCI triggers cell death and also regeneration of 
subpopulations of neurons with descending axons, as well as neurite sprouting from uninjured neurons30–32.
Differential Expression and Enrichment Analysis of Molecular Pathways during Spinal Cord 
Regeneration and Functional Recovery in Lamprey. 
Uninjured spinal cord tissues contain many 
neuronal subtypes (e.g. motoneurons, sensory neurons, interneurons) and glia (e.g. ependymal cells, microglia/
macrophages). In addition, we know that injury induces ependymal cells and microglia/macrophages to accu-
mulate at the lesion site28,33–35, though the relative proportions of these and other cell types at each post-injury 
time point are unknown. Brain tissue contained somata of axotomized neurons with descending axons, as well

as other neurons and glia that were not injured directly, but that respond to the injured state. Cell proliferation 
and neurite sprouting have also been reported in the lamprey brain after SCI28,32. To obtain gene expression 
profiles accompanying successful spinal cord regeneration and functional recovery in lampreys, we performed 
RNA-Seq on cDNA libraries generated from spinal cord tissue (1 cm) surrounding the lesion site in controls and 
at ten time points after SCI, ranging from 6 hours to 12 weeks, and in parallel, from brains of the same animals 
(Fig. 1a; boxes). RNA-Seq reads were mapped to annotated gene models from the published lamprey genome 
assembly (https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgGateway?db=petMar2)12. Standardized expression values for all

gene models are reported separately for each time point in brain and spinal cord (see Supplementary Table S1). 
To confirm homology-based annotations for selected key genes within this study, we performed new BLAST 
searches for several annotated homologs of human genes that are typically associated with regeneration, prolifer-
ation and cell death in mammals. These genes shared ~40–96% amino acid identity and high similarity (50–99% 
positives, which also include features like charge conservation), with the closest (presumptively orthologous) 
vertebrate sequence (see Supplementary Table S2).
To determine broad patterns of transcript expression following SCI, we used 2-way hierarchical clustering of 
expression profiles of spinal cord and brain. In both tissues, the gene expression profiles of the uninjured condi-
tion clustered separately from all time points obtained post injury (Fig. 2a,b). In the spinal cord, the clustering 
of expression profiles reflected progression through the time course of functional recovery, such that acute time 
points (6hpi to 3dpi) clustered separately from later time points (3 to 12wpi) (Fig. 2a). In contrast, hierarchical 
clustering of gene expression profiles in brain did not similarly reflect the progression through the time course 
of functional recovery (Fig. 2b). Notably, expression profiles at 1dpi and 6wpi formed a separate, distinct cluster. 
Transcriptional profiles at 12wpi in both spinal cord and brain clustered with profiles from other post-injury time 
points, indicating that altered gene expression occurred even in late stages of functional recovery and not a return 
to the uninjured state (Fig. 2a,b).
Next, we identified transcripts that were differentially expressed after SCI, relative to the uninjured condition, 
using EBSeq36. These analyses revealed robust and dynamic changes in gene expression in spinal cord and brain 
throughout the experimental time course (Fig. 2c,d). Notably, a distinct wave of newly differentially expressed 
transcripts was observed during the first week after SCI, corresponding to the onset of wound healing and tissue 
morphogenesis, but newly differentially expressed transcripts were detected throughout the course of functional 
recovery (Fig. 2e). This continued even into late stages of functional recovery (12wpi), at which point 238 and 
88 newly differentially expressed transcripts were observed in spinal cord and brain, respectively (Fig. 2e; see 
Supplementary Table S1). Thus, dynamic changes in gene expression persist throughout the time course of recov-
ery after SCI, even at late stages of behavioral recovery. We observed both shared and tissue-specific responses in 
expression at all post-injury time points (Fig. 2f; see Supplementary Table S3). This suggests that there are both 
global transcriptional responses to SCI and more locally tuned responses that reflect intrinsic differences in cell 
type and varying distances of the spinal cord and brain tissue from the lesion site.
We leveraged functional data from human and mouse to identify likely functions of differentially expressed 
transcripts using Enrichr, an open bioinformatics platform that utilizes mammalian data37. Analysis of statis-
tically enriched (p < 0.05) Gene Ontology (GO) categories encompassing differentially expressed transcripts 
indicated complex transcriptional responses in spinal cord and brain at most time points after SCI (Fig. 3a–d; 
see Supplementary Table S4). Broad functional categories of differentially expressed transcripts were related to 
immune function, extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling/deposition, development, neuronal function, prolif-
eration, cell death, cytoskeleton, ion channels, metabolism and transcription/translation (Fig. 3a–d). Previous 
histological studies of lampreys after SCI showed that cell proliferation occurs in the brain and even more so in 
the spinal cord, and that neuronal death increases in brain by 3wpi28–31. In agreement with these data, here we 
found that upregulated transcripts related to cell proliferation were more abundant in spinal cord than brain, 
while those related to cell death peaked in brain at 3wpi (Fig. 3a,b). Evaluation of differentially expressed tran-
scripts using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG, www.kegg.jp/kegg/kegg1.html) database 
indicated similar themes related to immune, ECM, development, neurological, and cytoskeletal processes (see 
Supplementary Table S5). Taken together, these analyses revealed transcriptional changes in broad functional 
gene categories after SCI in lampreys that have also been observed in other highly regenerative vertebrate species, 
such as zebrafish and axolotls, as well as in regenerating mammalian PNS3,38–40.
To identify transcription factor (TF) networks that could potentially coordinate molecular responses to SCI 
in lampreys, we used TRANSFAC/JASPAR to assign the differentially expressed transcripts to TFs known to reg-
ulate expression of mammalian homologues. TF networks that regulate the most highly expressed transcripts in 
uninjured spinal cord and brain are shown in Supplementary Fig. S1. We then analyzed TF networks regulating 
differentially expressed transcripts after SCI at 1dpi, 6wpi, and 12wpi, corresponding to acute, intermediate, and 
late phases of functional recovery (Fig. 4). Enriched TF networks differed between tissues at each time point and 
changed dramatically over time within each tissue (Fig. 4a,b). Notable TFs whose targets were enriched after 
SCI included: FOXC1, which has been implicated in embryonic development; NFKB1, a master regulator of the 
immune system and growth factors, and LEF1, a member of the canonical Wnt pathway, which has been impli-
cated in tissue regeneration in several species (Fig. 4a,b)41,42. In addition, 17 TFs with targets enriched amongst 
differentially expressed genes were previously identified in the mammalian PNS as regeneration-associated genes 
(RAGs) (Supplemental Table S7), 12 of which are shown in Fig. 4c. Several of these RAGs belong to canonical 
and non-canonical Wnt signaling pathways (e.g. JUN, LEF1, SMAD) (Fig. 4c)40–42. Interestingly, there were 4 
RAGs in the TF networks regulating differentially expressed transcripts in both tissues at all ten post-injury time 
points: CEBPB, GATA2, JUN, and LEF1 (Fig. 4c-red). Other RAGs with targets enriched amongst differentially 
expressed transcripts included KLF, SMAD, and STAT family members, which also intersect with Wnt signaling 
pathways41–43. These data indicate that the lamprey CNS utilizes highly conserved TF networks and signaling 
pathways that support neural repair and regeneration in the mammalian PNS and in other non-mammalian 
vertebrates that regenerate after SCI and suggest a role for Wnt signaling40,44–48.
We next examined SCI-induced expression changes in the RAGs themselves (Fig. 5)40,44,45. In the uninjured 
spinal cord and brain, individual RAGs were expressed at varying levels (Fig. 5a,b, left). SCI induced significant 
upregulation of most RAGs at one or multiple time points in both spinal cord and brain, beginning as early as 
6hpi (Fig. 5a,b, right). As expected, differentially expressed RAGs included many of the specific TFs that were pre-
dicted independently in the TRANSFAC analysis, including RAGs that intersect with Wnt signaling: JUN, KLF, 
REL, and SMAD family members (Fig. 5a,b). Interestingly, ATF3, a member of the CREB TF family that promotes

axon regeneration in mammalian PNS, as well as central axon branches in dorsal root ganglion neurons, was 
the most robustly induced RAG in both spinal cord and brain after SCI (Fig. 5a,b)40,49,50. In addition, homologs 
of JUN, SOX11, SMAD and REL, which along with ATF3, are positioned centrally within the core TF networks 
associated with mammalian PNS injury responses, were highly upregulated in spinal cord (Fig. 5)40. In the brain, 
several RAGs were significantly upregulated specifically at 1dpi and 6wpi (Fig. 5b) reflecting broader patterns 
identified through hierarchical clustering (Fig. 2a). The temporal expression profiles for JUN and ATF3 were 
further validated using qPCR, including the upregulation of JUN at 1dpi and 6wpi in brain (Fig. 5c). Together, 
these data show activation of highly conserved molecular pathways in the lamprey after SCI that also accompany 
regeneration in the mammalian PNS.
We also examined gene expression profiles for other gene families commonly studied in the context of 
PNS or CNS regeneration, including axon growth and guidance (Supplementary Fig. S2), extracellular matrix 
(Supplementary Fig. S3), cell proliferation/death (Supplementary Fig. S4), ion channels (Supplementary Fig. S5), 
and immune function (Supplementary Fig. S6). Broadly speaking, many axonal growth-promoting transcripts 
were upregulated after SCI (e.g. SNAP25, activin receptor ACVR1), while growth-restricting transcripts were 
downregulated (e.g. RHOB, SLIT2/3, ROBO2/3) (Supplementary Fig. S2). We also observed an upregulation of 
neurofilaments (NEFH/L) and synapsin (SYN2/3) gene family members in the brain, as well as differential expres-
sion of semaphorins and their receptors (SEMA3/4/5, PLXN) in both tissues, which is in agreement with previ-
ously published lamprey SCI studies that used in situ hybridization to detect expression changes (Supplementary 
Fig. S2)32,51–53. Transcripts associated with ECM deposition and remodeling were generally upregulated [e.g. 
collagens (COL), laminins (LAM), ADAMs, TIMPs] (Supplementary Fig. S3). Reflecting ongoing tissue repair, 
many cell proliferation related transcripts were highly upregulated after SCI in both spinal cord and brain 
(Supplementary Fig. S4)16,18. Interestingly, synuclein (SNCA) (Supplementary Fig. S4), a gene whose overex-
pression or mutation is linked to neurodegeneration in Parkinson’s disease, is upregulated in the spinal cord after 
SCI54,55. This increased expression may contribute to the accumulation of synuclein protein that occurs in a sub-
set of lamprey neurons after SCI and leads to neurodegeneration, which we previously reported31,56. Several ion 
channel transcripts were also differentially expressed after SCI, likely reflecting substantial changes in neuronal 
excitability during regeneration and functional recovery (Supplementary Fig. S5). In mammals, the immune sys-
tem has both beneficial and detrimental effects after SCI57,58. In lamprey, robust immune system responses were 
observed, with cytokines (e.g. IL8) and chemokines (e.g. CXCR4) and prostaglandins, upregulated acutely after 
SCI (Supplementary Fig. S6). However, this does not inhibit the robust regeneration and functional recovery that 
is normally achieved in these animals (see Fig. 1). Notably, upregulation of prostaglandins after traumatic brain 
injury in zebrafish has been previously shown to enhance tissue repair and recovery59. Though this is far from

conclusive, these data are consistent with a permissive or positive role for immune responses in recovery from 
SCI in lampreys.

body plan patterning, contact-dependent signaling, cell proliferation, tissue development and regeneration, stem 
cell self renewal, and axon guidance41–43,60–62. There are 19 mammalian Wnt genes, many of which are conserved 
across species (including invertebrates) and interact promiscuously with their multimeric receptors involving 
Frizzled and LRRP proteins. Porcupine (PORCN) is an O-acyltransferase required for Wnt palmitoylation, mat-
uration, and subsequent secretion63,64. Due to the important role of Wnts in various disease settings, including 
cancer, several small molecules have been identified that target PORCN or other Wnt pathway members60,63,64.

The role of Wnt signaling after SCI in mammals is complex and still controversial given the observation of highly 
variable results among different rat and mouse models42,43,65–67. However, Wnts appear to be pro-regenerative after 
SCI in zebrafish and after tail injury in salamander41,48,68,69. In fact, Voss and colleagues recently demonstrated that 
incubation in C59, a drug that inhibits PORCN, blocked salamander tail regeneration63,69.

As discussed above, some of the RAGs (e.g. JUN) and other differentially expressed transcripts belong to or 
intersect with Wnt signaling pathways, both canonical (beta-catenin dependent) or non-canonical (beta-catenin 
independent) pathways. We identified a total of 121 and 101 differentially expressed transcripts related to Wnt 
signaling in spinal cord and brain, respectively (Supplementary Table S6). Amongst these were transcripts encod-
ing for a number of Wnt and Frizzled family members, as well as proteins involved in intracellular Wnt signal-
ing (Fig. 6a,b). KEGG analysis revealed how extensively the Wnt signaling pathways were represented amongst 
the differentially expressed transcripts in spinal cord and brain, as well as TCF/LEF1 that was identified by 
TRANSFAC/JASPR in the transcription factor networks (Fig. 6c). The number of Wnt related transcripts peaked 
acutely within the first week post-injury in both spinal cord and brain with additional increases at later time 
points (Fig. 7a). In light of these data, we decided to directly assess whether Wnt signaling has any effect on func-
tional recovery after SCI in lampreys. We applied a single dose of the PORCN inhibitor C59 (10 μ
M) or vehicle to 
the spinal cord at the time and site of transection. Since porcupine is required for Wnt palmitoylation, secretion, 
and therefore activity, C59 potently inhibits Wnt signaling63. We then scored swimming behavior for 12 weeks, 
as in Fig. 1c. At 12wpi, when lampreys typically achieve full recovery, the animals that received C59 achieved an 
average movement score of 1.6 ± 0.6 and thus remained non-swimming or exhibited only brief uncoordinated 
swimming, while vehicle-treated animals achieved an average score of 3.33 ± 0.2 and swam in a coordinated 
sinusoidal wave (Fig. 7b).
To determine the molecular basis of these functional effects, and to confirm the efficacy of C59 in lampreys, we 
performed RNA-Seq on C59- and vehicle-treated lampreys at 3dpi, a period of rapid and dynamic change in the 
transcription of Wnt-responsive genes (Fig. 7a). Gene ontology analysis revealed significant expression changes 
in spinal cord transcripts that were related to cadherin and ankyrin binding; DNA replication and mitotic recom-
bination; collagen and fibrin organization; and cell development and differentiation, all of which are affected 
by Wnt signaling (Fig. 7c)70,71. Individual transcripts that were differentially expressed in spinal cord after C59 
treatment included direct targets of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, such as cadherin (CDH2), claudin 
(Cldn19), cyclin (CCNB2), fibronectin (FN1), and keratins (KRT6a/8/18) (Fig. 7c; Supplementary Table S6). In 
brain, the differentially expressed transcripts included additional targets of Wnt signaling, such as axin (Axin1), 
Jagged (JAG2), JUN, keratins (KRT7/10), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP9), and T-box transcription factors 
(Tbr1; TBX20) (Supplementary Table S6). These data indicate that Wnt signaling plays a positive and crucial role 
early on during the process of functional recovery after SCI in lampreys, likely through effects on cell adhesion 
and proliferation.
Discussion
Large-scale gene expression analyses are rapidly advancing our understanding of molecular responses in verte-
brates to nervous system injury38,40,72. For example, a microarray study of mammalian cortical neurons revealed 
developmentally regulated genes promoting axon outgrowth and an RNA-Seq study showed that in comparison 
to mammalian CNS neurons, PNS neurons had greater expression of pro-regenerative genes (i.e. growth fac-
tors)44,73. Molecular responses to SCI in zebrafish, which recover after SCI, resembled injury responses in the 
mammalian PNS5,38,40. Similarly, in frogs and salamanders, SCI induced rapid molecular responses that support 
neural regeneration39,74. Despite these advances in knowledge, there are a number of fundamental questions that 
still need to be addressed. First, what are the most conserved molecular mechanisms that support spinal cord 
regeneration and functional recovery2? This requires unbiased molecular profiling of CNS regeneration in a basal 
vertebrate that recovers after SCI, such as the lamprey. Second, how do the molecular mechanisms that support 
functional CNS regeneration change over time? This requires a denser temporal sampling after SCI than has 
been reported previously, spanning the entire time course of recovery. Third, how extensive are the molecular 
responses to SCI in the brain, which contains the cell bodies of injured neurons with descending axons? This 
requires parallel analyses of supraspinal molecular responses after SCI, which has been greatly understudied. 
While recent studies in mammals have yielded exciting potential strategies such as manipulating microtubule 
dynamics, enhancing successful regeneration and functional recovery after SCI in mammals remains challenging, 
in part because our understanding of the conserved molecular pathways that promote these processes success-
fully in other vertebrate species and biological settings is incomplete10.
Here, we addressed these three questions by performing the first RNA-Seq analysis on spinal cord and brain 
during regeneration after SCI in the sea lamprey, a vertebrate that provides a critical perspective on the deep 
ancestry of all living vertebrates. The lamprey has long been appreciated to have the amazing capacity to regen-
erate and recover function after complete spinal cord transection. However, a relative paucity of molecular tools 
in the lamprey has largely limited studies of the molecular mechanisms underlying these abilities to a candidate 
gene approach33,51,52,75–77. The increasing ease of performing RNA-Seq, which uses direct sequencing without 
prior sequence information, is aiding a greater understanding of molecular responses in species with historically 
limited genomic resources such as lamprey12,78,79.
Results from this study reveal several key findings. First, these data reinforce lessons from the recent publica-
tion of the lamprey genome, which is that the lamprey CNS expresses homologs of a large number of mammalian 
CNS genes, indicating a high degree of molecular conservation across vertebrates12. Second, SCI in lamprey 
induces expression of many transcripts associated with regeneration in the mammalian PNS, illustrating the 
power of this organism as a model for identifying and studying highly conserved, fundamental, pro-regenerative 
molecular pathways3,38–40,44. Third, SCI induces rapid, robust, and long-lasting changes in gene expression in the 
brain, implicating supraspinal responses as a major component of anatomical and functional recovery. Fourth, 
late stages of functional recovery occur in a novel molecular context and are not a simple restoration to the unin-
jured transcriptional program. Fifth, Wnt signaling is necessary for functional recovery in the lamprey after SCI, 
justifying future studies aimed at elucidating the required aspects of the Wnt pathway.

One of the most surprising findings from this study is the robust and complex transcriptional responses 
occurring in the lamprey brain after SCI. Previous studies in lamprey revealed SCI-induced changes in expression

levels of genes related to axon growth and guidance within the RS neuron somata located in the brain and in 
the tips of regenerating axons33,51,52,76,77,80. Here, we confirmed and extended these observations to demonstrate 
global supraspinal changes in gene expression throughout the course of functional recovery. As data increas-
ingly indicate that it is possible to promote functional recovery in persons in the chronic phase of SCI, under-
standing supraspinal molecular responses that are consistent with neuroplasticity and regeneration, such as those 
described here, will be of increasing importance81,82.
Multiple independent bioinformatics analyses revealed that RAGs, many of which are members of the canon-
ical and non-canonical Wnt signaling pathways, are differentially expressed after SCI in lamprey. ATF3 was the 
most highly induced RAG in both tissues (Fig. 5). In mammals, ATF3 enhances neurite outgrowth, partly by 
promoting effects of JUN49,83. Microarray analyses also revealed that ATF3 is upregulated after SCI in zebrafish38. 
Both ATF3 and JUN were identified as synergistic hubs in TF networks that promote regeneration of mammalian 
dorsal root ganglion neurons, peripheral neurons with high regenerative potential40. In mammals, Wnts plays 
a role in axon growth during development. However, the role of Wnts after SCI is still unclear because different 
injury models and use of multiple rodent species have resulted in conflicting data suggestive of both positive and 
negative roles41–43,65–67. As mentioned earlier, Wnts promote regeneration and recovery from injury in several 
non-mammalian vertebrates, including zebrafish, salamanders48,68,69 and now lampreys. Interestingly, Wnts were 
also recently shown to be differentially expressed during head regeneration in a hemichordate, suggesting that 
their functional roles are deeply evolutionarily conserved84. Future experiments are needed to determine the 
mechanism by which Wnt signaling promotes functional recovery, including an analysis of the affected cellular 
and molecular pathways.
Despite these important new insights, we acknowledge several limitations to this study. The current lamprey 
reference transcriptome is incomplete, and future iterations will incorporate germline-specific regions and more 
diverse transcriptomic datasets12. Also, the tools for functional genetic analyses in lamprey are not as well devel-
oped as in other SCI models. However, gene overexpression, morpholino and CRISPR/Cas9 knockdowns, as 
well as pharmacological agents, have already been used successfully to manipulate gene expression in lampreys, 
providing multiple avenues for additional functional analyses53,56,85–89. Furthermore, although we present here a 
complex molecular profile of transcripts expressed in the entire brain and spinal cord, which contains a wide array 
of cell types, future analyses will be greatly facilitated by determining the molecular programs that are specific to 
individual cell types or brain regions. Lastly, we used an inhibitor that targets secretion of all Wnts, so the precise 
components of this pathway needed to support regeneration after SCI requires further inquiry. Despite these 
considerations, this study provides broad mechanistic insights into conserved molecular pathways, including Wnt 
signaling, that promote anatomical and functional recovery after SCI in vertebrates.
Methods
Experiments were performed on late larval sea lampreys (Petromyzon marinus, 10–13 cm; ~5–7 years old), in 
accordance with institutional IACUC regulations and included in experimental protocols approved by The 
Marine Biological Laboratory and The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research. Spinal cord transections, behav-
ioral recovery scoring, and tissue histochemistry were performed as described previously18,27. To block Wnt sig-
naling, Wnt-C59, (Selleckchem; Houston, TX) was added (10μ
M in 0.1% DMSO/PBS) at the time and site of 
spinal injury via a small piece of Gelfoam (Pfizer, NY, NY). Animals undergoing spinal cord injury and treated 
with vehicle (0.1% DMSO/PBS) were used as controls. These manipulations slowed the trajectory of functional 
recovery (Fig. 7b-vehicle), compared to recovery without any manipulations (Fig. 1c), which is due to insertion 
of the Gelfoam.
RNA-Seq library preparation and sequencing. 
Brains (whole brains without olfactory lobes) and spinal 
cords (1 cm surrounding the lesion), were harvested from uninjured lampreys, and at 10 time points from 6 hours 
to 12 weeks post injury (Fig. 1a). Tissue was stored in RNALater and then homogenized, pooled by time point 
(n = 6 animals per time point), and total RNA (RIN > 8.4) extracted using Trizol. RNA-Seq libraries were created 
using TruSeq RNA Sample Prep Kit v2 (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA), + Ribo-Zero Gold (Epicentre). RNA-Seq 
libraries (~250 bp) were sequenced using 100 bp paired end (pe) reads on the Illumina HiSeq Platform at the 
Genomics Core, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (New York, NY).
Statistical analysis of RNA-Seq data. 
The average number of RNA-Seq reads per timepoint was 
135,742,182 in spinal cord and 139,024,579 in brain. Total RNA-Seq reads for all time points was 1,493,164,006 for 
the spinal cord and 1,529,270,374 for the brain. RNA-Seq reads were mapped against gene models from the pub-
licly available lamprey genome (Ensembl; Pmarinus_7.0)12. Gene expression levels were estimated for all lamprey 
gene models separately for all time points, and tissues and were quantified from each time point using RNA-Seq 
by Expectation-Maximization (RSEM)90. The expression values (TPM) for all 24,272 gene models are provided in 
Table S1. Within the lamprey genome, more than one gene may be the presumptive homolog of a specific human 
or mouse gene and may represent split gene models or gene duplication events (recent and ancient)12,91. For 
preparation of figures, a single homolog was selected that maximized transcript length, expression (transcripts 
per million, TPM), and amino acid sequence identity with the corresponding mammalian homolog. BLAST 
results for a sample of transcripts are shown in Table S2. For clarity, data presented in the figures focus only on the 
annotated transcripts, unless otherwise specified. Following estimation of expression values, EBSeq was used to 
identify differentially expressed genes throughout the experimental time course36,92. Fold change estimates and 
corresponding Bayesian statistics are presented in Table S1. Genes were considered of interest for further analysis 
if they were determined to be differentially expressed by EBSeq with a posterior probability of differential expres-
sion (PPDE) of ≥
0.95. JMP Statistical software (SAS) was used to create heat maps and to perform hierarchical 
clustering. To illustrate relative changes in transcript expression (Figs 5 and 6, Supplementary Figures S2–S6),

fold change (FC) relative to uninjured values shown is the −
Log2(PostFC) transformation of values generated by 
EBSeq. Deep sequencing and processed data sets were deposited in Gene Expression Omnibus.
Enrichment analysis of RNA-Seq data. 
Genes were analyzed using the program Enrichr37. Enrichr uses 
official human and mouse gene symbols for its input data, and symbols used in our analyses were assigned on 
the basis of the published set of lamprey gene annotations12. GO terms that were concatenated for simplicity into 
larger related categories or categorized as “Other” in Fig. 3 are available in Table S4.
