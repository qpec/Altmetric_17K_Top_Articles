BACKGROUND: Children with sickle cell anemia (SCA) are at increased risk for invasive 
pneumococcal disease; antibiotic prophylaxis significantly reduces this risk. We calculated 
the proportion of children with SCA who received ≥300 days of antibiotic prophylaxis and 
identified predictors of such receipt.
METHODS: Children aged 3 months to 5 years with SCA were identified by the presence of 
3 or more Medicaid claims with a diagnosis of SCA within a calendar year (2005–2012) 
in Florida, Illinois, Louisiana, Michigan, South Carolina, and Texas. Receipt of antibiotics 
was identified through claims for filled prescriptions. The outcome, receipt of ≥300 days 
of antibiotics, was assessed annually by using varying classifications of antibiotics. By 
using logistic regression with generalized estimating equations, we estimated the odds 
of receiving ≥300 days of antibiotics, with potential predictors of age, sex, year, state, and 
health services use.
RESULTS: A total of 2821 children contributed 5014 person-years. Overall, only 18% of 
children received ≥300 days of antibiotics. Each additional sickle cell disease-related 
outpatient visit (odds ratio = 1.01, 95% confidence interval: 1.01–1.02) and well-child visit 
(odds ratio = 1.08, 95% confidence interval: 1.02–1.13) was associated with incrementally 
increased odds of receiving ≥300 days of antibiotics.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite national recommendations and proven lifesaving benefit, antibiotic 
prophylaxis rates are low among children with SCA. Numerous health care encounters may 
offer an opportunity for intervention; in addition, such interventions likely need to include 
social factors that may affect the ability for a child to receive and adhere to antibiotic 
prophylaxis.

 Sickle cell disease affects 
predominately racial and ethnic 
minority populations in the United 
States; 1 in 375 African American 
infants are diagnosed with this 
recessive genetic condition.1 
–5 
Children with sickle cell disease are 
affected by numerous morbidities, 
such as an increased risk of invasive 
pneumococcal disease (IPD), caused 
by Streptococcus pneumoniae.5, 
 
6
Although children and adults 
with sickle cell disease are at an 
increased risk of IPD, children 
with the sickle cell anemia (SCA) 
subtype (hemoglobin SS) are at 
greatest risk for both the disease 
and related case fatality.7, 
 
8 Without 
intervention, children with SCA 
have up to 100 times the risk of IPD 
as compared with children with 
normal hemoglobin.7 Daily receipt 
of penicillin is an effective method to 
reduce the incidence of IPD among 
children with SCA. The Prophylactic 
Penicillin Study revealed an 84% 
reduction in the risk of infection 
among children that received daily 
penicillin as compared with those 
receiving the placebo.9 More recently, 
the National Heart, Lung, and Blood 
Institute (NHLBI) reiterated the 
importance of penicillin prophylaxis 
in updated recommendations for the 
management of sickle cell disease 
indicating that children with SCA 
receive twice-daily oral penicillin 
until age 5.10, 
 
11
Although the effectiveness of daily 
penicillin prophylaxis has been 
known for decades, limited evidence 
indicates low rates of compliance 
among children.12, 
 
13 Although the 
authors of these studies offer some 
insight into penicillin prophylaxis 
among children with sickle cell 
disease, they do not focus specifically 
on the NHLBI-specified target 
population of children with SCA. 
In addition, the classification of 
antibiotic prophylaxis varies between 
studies, making comparability 
difficult.12 
–14 To address these issues, 
we assessed rates of antibiotic 
prophylaxis among children with 
SCA by using varying definitions 
of antibiotic prophylaxis. We also 
explored predictors of receipt of 
≥300 days of antibiotics, with the 
goal of characterizing opportunities 
for intervention to increase rates of 
antibiotic prophylaxis among this 
population.
MethODs
We conducted a multistate 
analysis of antibiotic prophylaxis 
among children with SCA by 
using administrative claims data 
(University of Michigan Institutional 
Review Board HUM00120422).
Data source
Our target population was drawn 
from the Medicaid programs for 
the following 6 states that had 
an average to high prevalence of 
SCA: Florida, Illinois, Louisiana, 
Michigan, South Carolina, and Texas. 
Medicaid Analytic eXtract (MAX) 
administrative data were acquired 
from the Centers for Medicare 
and Medicaid Services; at the time 
of the study, these states only 
contained valid data through 2012. 
Administrative data (2005–2012) 
included enrollment history and all 
paid claims for inpatient, outpatient, 
emergency department (ED), 
laboratory, and outpatient pharmacy 
services.15 Authors of previous 
studies have indicated ∼90% of 
children with SCA are enrolled in 
Medicaid at some point in time, and 
we expect that Medicaid data will 
capture a large proportion of the 
children with SCA.16, 
 
17
study Population
We identified children with SCA using 
a case definition of the presence of 
at least 3 claims for a child within a 
calendar year that were SCA-related 
(282.61, 282.62). This case definition 
was previously demonstrated to have 
a high level of sensitivity (91.4%) 
and specificity (80%) as compared 
with the gold standard of newborn 
screening records.17, 
 
18 Continuous 
enrollment in the Medicaid program 
for at least 1 calendar year within 
this time period was required. For 
each year a child was eligible for the 
study population, we restricted our 
analysis to children with no other 
forms of health insurance (ie, private 
insurance) during the study period to 
maximize the completeness of claims 
available. Children were eligible to 
contribute multiple nonsequential 
years to the study population (eg, 
2005 and 2007). Children were 
<5 years old throughout each 
contributed person-year, consistent 
with NHLBI recommendations for 
penicillin prophylaxis.11
Definitions of antibiotic Prophylaxis
Oral penicillin is recommended 
by the NHLBI for prophylaxis 
against IPD. However, the American 
Academy of Pediatrics recommends 
erythromycin for children with 
a suspected or proven penicillin 
allergy, and amoxicillin is sometimes 
prescribed for practical reasons 
and is equally effective against S 
pneumoniae. Therefore, we classified 
antibiotics by using the following 4 
definitions:
1. oral penicillin;
2. oral penicillin or erythromycin;
3. oral penicillin, erythromycin, or 
amoxicillin; and
4. any antibiotic likely to protect 
against S pneumoniae (including 
penicillin, erythromycin, 
amoxicillin).19 
–23
Antibiotics were identified in 
pharmacy claims by using relevant 
national drug codes associated with 
an antibiotic (Supplemental Table 4). 
An author with expertise in pediatric 
infectious diseases (A.T.) reviewed 
these records and classified them as 
described above.
antibiotic Prophylaxis
The total number of days’ supply 
of antibiotics within a year was

Downloaded from 
 determined by summing the days’ 
supply reported within each filled 
prescription. Adequate antibiotic 
prophylaxis was defined as having 
filled antibiotic prescriptions that 
would cover ≥300 days of the year; 
this definition of adequate antibiotic 
adherence has been endorsed by the 
National Quality Forum.18 As such, 
this quality assessment should be 
viewed as a “best case” assessment 
because some children still would 
not have prophylaxis for all days in a 
given year.
Predictors of antibiotic adherence
We evaluated potential associations 
between receiving ≥300 days’ supply 
of antibiotics and the following 
predictors: age, sex, use of health 
services (sickle cell disease-related 
inpatient, outpatient, ED, or well-
child visits), calendar year, and 
state of residence.24 Our approach 
adjusted for state of residence as a 
confounder to partially account for 
the unmeasured variation of these 
factors between states. Classification 
of health care encounters was 
expanded to include any mention 
of sickle cell disease to account for 
potential misclassification of sickle 
cell subtype within the encounter.
statistical analysis
Frequencies and percentages (or 
means, medians, and SDs) were 
determined for demographic 
characteristics obtained from 
the MAX enrollment files. The 
total number of days’ supply of 
antibiotics for each child within the 
study population was calculated by 
definition, as well as the proportion 
of children that received ≥300 days’ 
supply within the calendar year, for 
each year and state.
Means, SDs, and interquartile ranges 
of the number of annual health 
services visits were assessed. Logistic 
regression was used to estimate the 
bivariate associations between each 
potential predictor and receiving 
≥300 days of antibiotics. For the 
purposes of this analysis, Definition 
3 (penicillin, erythromycin, or 
amoxicillin) was used because this 
definition was permissive without 
being all-inclusive. Because multiple 
periods of enrollment were allowed 
for each child, generalized estimating 
equation models with robust SEs 
accounted for correlation among 
children. Counts of health care 
services and age were modeled 
continuously; predictors showing an 
association (P < .20) were included 
in a final multivariable model. Odds 
ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence 
intervals (CIs) were used to assess 
the final associations. For all 
models, regression diagnostics were 
performed to assess normality of 
error variances.
We performed a sensitivity analysis 
to account for potential limitations of 
pharmacy claims data pertaining to 
the dispensed days’ supply reported 
on claims. If pharmacy claims for 
filled prescriptions are missing, our 
results would be an underestimate 
of the true proportion of children 
receiving antibiotic prophylaxis. 
First, we assessed the number of 
person-years that included 0 fills 
for penicillin, erythromycin, or 
amoxicillin. Then, we explored how 
our results would be impacted if we 
assumed that observation with less 
than a 30 days’ supply of antibiotics 
was because of incomplete claims 
records. We excluded any person-
years that had fewer than 30 days’ 
supply reported for penicillin, 
erythromycin, or amoxicillin within a 
calendar year. Among this restricted 
population, we calculated the 
proportion of children that had ≥300 
days of antibiotics filled; these results 
were compared with those for the 
full study population for each year by 
using 2-proportion z tests.
Results
A total of 2821 children with SCA 
between the ages of 3 months and 
5 years of age were identified from 
the MAX data set from 2005 to 
2012, contributing a total of 5014 
person-years. The number of person-
years varied by state as follows: 
Florida (1619, 32%), Texas (897, 
18%), Louisiana (855, 17%), Illinois 
(622, 12%), Michigan (580, 12%), 
and South Carolina (441, 9%). The 
study population was comprised of 
48% girls (n = 1364) and 52% boys 
(n = 1457). In 2005, the average 
age was 1.6 years (SD = 1.1); this 
was consistent across each year of 
observation (Table 1). Across states, 
the median age was 2 years, with the 
exception of South Carolina, in which 
the median age was 1 year.
The mean number of days of filled 
antibiotic prescriptions varied by 
definition and by year (Fig 1A). 
The average number of days of 
filled prescriptions was as follows: 
162 days of penicillin (SD = 117; 
median: 160), 164 days of penicillin 
or erythromycin (SD = 117; median: 
160), 178 days of penicillin, 
erythromycin, or amoxicillin (SD = 
113; median: 180), and 193 days of 
any S pneumoniae antibiotic (SD = 
116; median: 194).
The proportion of children that 
received ≥300 days of antibiotics also 
varied by definition and year (Fig 
1B): 16% of children received ≥300 
days of penicillin, 16% of children 
received ≥300 days of penicillin 
or erythromycin, 18% of children 
received ≥300 days of penicillin, 
erythromycin, or amoxicillin, and 
22% of children received ≥300 days 
of any S pneumoniae antibiotic.
The proportion of children 
receiving ≥300 days of penicillin, 
erythromycin, or amoxicillin 
(Definition 3) varied by state (Fig 2). 
This proportion ranged from 19% 
(2009, 2012) to 27% (2005, 2007), 
with South Carolina having the 
lowest proportion of children with 
receiving ≥300 days of antibiotic 
prophylaxis at any time point (6% in 
2009).

 Overall, children in the study 
population had an annual mean of 
1.7 SCD-related inpatient hospitali-
zations (SD = 1.8), 13.2 SCD-related 
outpatient visits (SD = 11.1),  
3.8 ED visits (SD = 3.4), and 1.6 
well-child visits (SD = 1.5) (Table 2). 
Bivariate analysis indicated that  
the number of sickle cell disease-
related outpatient visits (OR = 1.01, 
P < .0001), well-child visits (OR = 
1.09, P = .0008), ED visits (OR = 
1.05, P < .0001), state of residence 
(ORs varied by state), and calendar 
year (ORs varied by year) were 
independently associated with 
receiving ≥300 days of antibiotics; 
age (OR = 0.98, P = .67) and number 
of sickle cell disease-related inpatient 
visits were not associated (OR = 
1.02, P = .39). The final multivariable 
model indicated that the number of 
sickle cell disease-related outpatient 
visits, well-child visits, and state of 
residence continued to be associated 
with the outcome. Each additional 
well-child visit was associated with 
incrementally increased odds of 
receiving ≥300 days of antibiotics 
(OR = 1.08, 95% CI: 1.02–1.13), 
as was each additional sickle cell 
disease-related outpatient visit (OR = 
1.01, 95% CI: 1.01–1.02). A child that 
was at the third quartile of sickle cell 
disease-related outpatient visits (17 
annual visits) had 15% greater odds 
of receiving ≥300 days of antibiotics 
as a child in the first quartile of sickle 
cell disease-related outpatient visits 
(6 visits). The odds of receiving ≥300 
days of antibiotics did not differ in 
any year as compared with 2005 
(Table 3).
sensitivity analysis
A total of 286 person-years 
(5.7%) had 0 fills for penicillin, 
erythromycin, or amoxicillin. 
Furthermore, only 544 person-
years (10.8%) had pharmacy 
claims for fewer than 30 days’ 
supply of penicillin, erythromycin, 
or amoxicillin. On exclusion of 
these children, there were 4470 
person-years (89.2%) in the 
restricted population; 20.1% of 
these person-years had ≥300 days 
filled compared with 17.9% in the 
full study population. There was no 
statistically significant difference in 
the proportion of children receiving 
≥300 days of antibiotics as compared 
with the full study population in any 
year.
DIscussIOn
In this multistate analysis, receipt 
of antibiotic prophylaxis among 
children with SCA was persistently 
low, irrespective of year or state. We 
found that the majority of children 
with SCA do not receive ≥300 days of 
antibiotics within a year, even when 
broadened definitions of antibiotic 
prophylaxis were considered. These 
findings are particularly troubling 
given the elevated risk and case 
fatality rate of IPD among children 
with SCA, even with the introduction 
of the pneumococcal conjugate 
vaccine.7, 
 
8, 
 
25 The methods we applied 
in this study establish a framework 
in which to assess the proportion 
of children adequately protected 
against IPD, providing an important 
first step toward identifying 
opportunities for improvement.
Our findings indicate that a substantial 
gap exists between use of prophylactic 
antibiotics among children with 
SCA and NHLBI recommendations, 
which indicate penicillin prophylaxis 
until age 5.10, 
 
11 Although the NHLBI 
guidelines indicate that oral penicillin 
is the most appropriate prophylaxis 
against IPD, 
11 we reasoned that it was 
important to understand if children 
were protected with alternative 
antibiotics because intervention 
approaches to increase rates of

 prophylaxis would depend on if 
children were adequately protected 
(even if by nonrecommended 
methods), or if the children were 
not receiving any antibiotics to 
protect against IPD. However, even 
considering the broadest definition 
of antibiotic prophylaxis, fewer than 
one-third of children received ≥300 
days of these antibiotics across 
the study period. Although these 
results are remarkably low, they 
are consistent with other studies 
of medication adherence among 
young pediatric populations enrolled 
in Medicaid, such as hydroxyurea 
therapy among children with SCA or 
asthma controllers among children 
with persistent asthma.26, 
27
In other studies of antibiotic 
prophylaxis in children with 
sickle cell disease, authors report 
similar results, even when varying 
definitions of antibiotic prophylaxis 
and study populations are taken into 
consideration.12 
– 
14 In the Wisconsin 
Medicaid program, only 23% of 
children with SCA received penicillin 
and/or amoxicillin for 80% of the 
year (292 days).13 Although our 
results do not differ substantially from 
these studies, this study provides an 
updated benchmark for receipt of 
antibiotic prophylaxis among children 
with SCA. Children with SCA receive 
suboptimal preventive care in other 
areas as well. For example, ∼30% 
of children with sickle cell disease 
have not received recommended 
pneumococcal conjugate vaccine 
by 59 months of age.28 Transcranial 
Doppler ultrasonography, 
recommended to identify children 
at a high risk of stroke, also has low 
rates among these states, with only 
45% of children screened annually. 
However, unlike our rates of antibiotic 
prophylaxis, which did not increase 
over time, transcranial Doppler 
screening rates increased from 2005 
to 2012.24 Although policy differences 
may exist across states within this 
study, all children benefited from 
the Early and Periodic Screening, 
Diagnostic, and Treatment program, 
which are federally mandated to 
provide robust Medicaid benefits to 
children. Although state was included 
as an independent variable in our 
models, it is possible that differences 
between states in the availability and 
accessibility to health care services 
could contribute to the variation seen 
across time within states.
Given the consistent finding that 
antibiotic prophylaxis rates are

 low among children with SCA, 
development of practical and  
effective interventions are key.  
These interventions should be focused 
at both the provider and the patient 
and parent level to ensure a more 
comprehensive approach to reducing 
the barriers associated with antibiotic 
prophylaxis among this population.25 
Provider-focused strategies to 
increase adherence could capitalize 
on the numerous annual outpatient 
encounters with the health care 
system that children with SCA  
are already experiencing.24, 
 
29  
For example, previously successful 
interventions to increase medication 
adherence within health care 
encounters have targeted physician 
prescribing habits and provider-
led adherence promotion.30, 
31 In 
previous research, authors have also 
indicated that primary care physicians 
have a lower level of self-efficacy 
and knowledge in the provision of 
preventive care of children with 
SCA. As such, education of primary 
care physicians in the importance 
of these preventive services is 
necessary.32 Patient and parent-
focused interventions may be most 
effective when focused on family 
and social factors that may impact 
receipt of filled prescriptions at the 
pharmacy and administration of the 
antibiotics to the child. For example, 
the typical formulation of prophylactic 
antibiotics requires that refills be 
obtained frequently given the limited 
shelf life.33 Although none of the 
state Medicaid programs included in 
this analysis require a co-payment 
for pediatric prescriptions, social 
factors such as the availability of 
transportation to pharmacies, and the 
time required to pick up medications, 
may be a significant barrier to 
families because numerous trips to 
the pharmacy each year are required 
for refills.34, 
 
35 Families with children 
with SCA already face a substantial 
burden of care, which is coupled 
with challenges of administering 
daily antibiotics to a young child that 
may by all outward signs appear 
healthy. Therefore, assessment of the

Downloaded from 
 knowledge and perceptions regarding 
the risk of IPD among caregivers, 
particularly after introduction of the 
pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, 
may provide key information for 
focused interventions to increase 
administration of antibiotics.36, 
 
37
There are several limitations to 
this study. First, the presence of 
a filled antibiotic prescription 
does not necessarily indicate 
that the medication was actually 
administered to the patient for whom 
it was prescribed. This limitation 
suggests that our results may be an 
overestimate of the true proportion 
of children with SCA protected 
against IPD. Second, our study 
population consisted of children 
with at least 3 annual claims for 
SCA; although this definition had 
a high sensitivity and specificity 
for identifying cases, children with 
less interaction with the health 
care system would not be included. 
We anticipate these children would 
also be less likely to receive ≥300 
days of antibiotics within a year, 
indicating another overestimation 
of the true rates. Third, the use of 
administrative data to assess quality 
of care among children with SCA 
is advantageous given the broad 
potential for application and low 
cost. As with other administrative 
claims methods that are commonly 
used in quality of care assessments, 
these methods are subject to the 
limitations of coding accuracy and 
claims completeness.38 However, our 
administrative claims-based SCA case 
definition was previously validated 
by using newborn screening as a 
gold standard, demonstrating a high 
degree of accuracy in Michigan.17 
We would expect this definition to 
perform similarly across the United 
States because of similar claims-based 
definitions to identify children with 
SCA in other states, as well as  
similarly high levels of health care 
use across states.17, 
 
24, 
29, 
 
39 
– 
41 Fourth, 
although our data were only complete 
through 2012, we do not expect 
that care has improved markedly 
since that time, absent a coordinated 
and directed quality improvement 
program. Finally, we were unable  
to ascertain pneumococcal  
vaccination coverage among  
our study population, which may  
provide additional protection  
against IPD.
cOnclusIOns
Despite long-standing national 
recommendations, antibiotic 
prophylaxis against IPD remains 
low among children with SCA, 
and efforts aimed at increasing 
adherence are urgently needed. 
It is unknown which mechanisms 
will be the most effective; however, 
numerous health care encounters 
may offer an opportunity for 
intervention. In addition, such 
interventions likely need to include 
social factors that may affect  
the ability for a child to receive  
and adhere to antibiotic 
prophylaxis.
