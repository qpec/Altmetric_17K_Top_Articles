Study Objectives: To determine if weekend catch-up sleep (CUS) impacts body mass index (BMI) in the general population.
Methods: A stratified random sample (2156 subjects; age 19–82 years old, 43.0 ± 14.5; 1183 male) from the general population was evaluated, in 2010, using 
face-to-face interviews about sociodemographic characteristics, height, weight, habitual sleep duration, and time-in-bed at night on weekdays and weekend, 
sleep-related profiles, mood and anxiety scales, and comorbid-medical conditions. Weekend CUS was identified when nocturnal sleep extension occurred over 
the weekend, and this was quantified. Average sleep duration, BMI, and chronotype were determined. The association of BMI with the presence and the amount 
of weekend CUS was analyzed, independent of average sleep duration, chronotype, and sociodemographic factors.
Results: BMI and average sleep duration was 23.0 ± 3.0 kg/m2 and 7.3 ± 1.2 hours, respectively. The weekend CUS group consisted of 932 subjects (43.2%) 
who slept longer on weekend than weekdays by 1.8 ± 1.1 hours. Weekend CUS subjects had a significantly lower BMI (22.8 ± 0.19 kg/m2) than the non-CUS 
(23.1 ± 0.19 kg/m2) group, after adjustment for age, sex, average sleep duration, chronotype, other sociodemographic factors, and anxiety/mood status (p = .01) 
The relationship between weekend CUS and BMI was dose-dependent (p = 0.02): Every additional hour of weekend CUS was associated with a decrease of 
0.12 kg/m2 in BMI (95% confidence interval, −0.23 to −0.02).
Conclusions: Weekend sleep extension may have biological protective effects in preventing sleep-restriction induced or related obesity. The results suggest a 
simple population-level strategy to minimize effects of sleep loss.
Keywords: Sleep deprivation, obesity, chronobiology, sleep duration, body weight, chronotype.
INTRODUCTION
The rise in obesity is a major public health concern.1 Increased 
body weight is related to altered blood pressure regulation and 
glucose metabolism, which then leads to hypertension, diabe-
tes/metabolic syndrome, and eventually results in increased 
cardiovascular mortality risk.2,3 The increasing longevity of 
humans allows relatively small effects to have substantial long-
term consequences: sleep state (quality, duration, timing) is one 
such factor. Excessive calorie intake and sedentary life style are 
regarded as the 2 main factors in the development of obesity,4,5 
but abnormal sleep is now considered to contribute to the obe-
sity epidemics.4 Sleep curtailment, disrupted sleep, or circadian 
misalignment is all related to increased body weight.6–15
In a modern society, habitual sleep restriction seems to be 
inevitable due to social obligations or work schedules, with 
a tendency to reduced sleep duration.16 The importance of 
insufficient sleep in the development of obesity is highlighted 
in that it is a substantially common and potentially modifia-
ble condition.4,16 Insufficient sleep has undesirable effects on 
metabolism, by inducing obesity, glucose intolerance, and dys-
lipidemia, which contribute to the development of metabolic 
syndrome and cardiovascular disease.10,17–22 Sleep curtailment 
increases ghrelin and reduces leptin levels along with a sympa-
thetic tilt to sympathovagal imbalance, leading in aggregate to 
a rise of stress hormones, increased appetite and caloric intake, 
especially fat nutrients, eventually leading to obesity and met-
abolic derangement.8,23–27 There is some preliminary evidence 
supporting the concept that sleep extension improves glucose 
metabolism and cognitive function in healthy subjects with 
chronic sleep insufficiency.28,29
To cope with sleep loss, people usually engage in daytime 
napping or extend nighttime sleep during weekends or other 
time periods free from social or work obligation. Such meas-
ures might counteract the deleterious effects of sleep debt. 
Midday napping reduces coronary mortality and improves 
cognitive performance, and weekend sleep extension is asso-
ciated with a lowered risk of hypertension.30–32 However, the 
role of napping remains controversial. A few population-based 
studies report associations of napping with increased obesity, 
diabetes, and mortality.33–36 It is difficult to dissociate the 
effects of sleep pathology, for example, sleep apnea, causing 
napping versus inadequate sleep, and the likely the impact of 
these conditions could be different. However, weekend CUS 
is somewhat more “physiological,” similar to drinking after a 
Statement of Significance
Short sleep is increasingly regarded as a risk for obesity. This study demonstrates a significant dose-dependent relationship between lower 
body mass index (BMI) and weekend sleep extension in an adult general population, independent of average sleep duration across the week 
and chronotype. Chronotype was also associated with BMI: the later the chronotype, the higher the BMI, an association attenuated by weekend 
sleep extension. The results imply that weekend sleep extension provides protection against weight gain related to sleep restriction as well as 
late chronotype.

period thirst to restore homeostasis. The association between 
weekend sleep extension and cardiometabolic disorders, espe-
cially obesity, in adult population is largely unknown. Only 
2 studies in children demonstrating a relationship between 
longer weekend sleep and lower risk of obesity have been 
reported.37,38
Weekend sleep extension is not solely explained by sleep debt 
built-up over weekdays. Circadian preference also contributes 
to the differences in nocturnal sleep duration between the week-
days (conforming to a social clock) and weekend (conforming 
to an endogenous clock). The evening type sleeps are longer in 
the weekends than during the weekdays39 and is associated with 
obesity and metabolic derangement.15,40 Therefore, circadian 
preferences need to be considered to interpret the relationship 
between weekend sleep extension and metabolic health includ-
ing body weight.
In this study, we aimed to investigate the association between 
weekend sleep extension and body mass index (BMI) in the 
general adult population. The hypothesis tested is that weekend 
sleep extension is related to lower body weight in adults, inde-
pendent of habitual sleep duration and circadian preference.
METHODS
Study Population and Survey Methods
We included subjects (aged 19 years or older) who participated 
in a nationwide cross-sectional survey of sleep and headache, 
in the Republic of Korea.32 The sampling of subjects and survey 
was conducted by Gallup Korea in 2010 using a 2-stage random 
sampling method proportional to the distribution of the popula-
tion from 15 administrative districts. According to the popula-
tion distribution of age and sex, Gallup Korea approached 7616 
subjects and a total of 2836 subjects (age 43.0 ± 14.5 years old; 
1183 male) completed the survey through a face-to-face inter-
view. The interview was performed by trained personnel using 
structured questionnaires about sociodemographic character-
istics, height, weight, habitual sleep duration and time-in-bed 
at night during weekdays and weekends, sleep-related profiles 
including sleep quality, insomnia, habitual snoring, and daytime 
sleepiness, a mood and anxiety scale, and comorbid medical con-
ditions. For this study, we excluded 151 subjects working as shift 
workers and 529 subjects with missing of any relevant informa-
tion. A total of 2156 subjects (age 19–82, 43.0 ± 14.5 years old; 
1183 male) was included in the final analysis.
The study design was approved by the institutional review 
board of Seoul National University Bundang Hospital and 
Hallym University Sacred Heart Hospital. All participants pro-
vided written informed consent.
Sleep Duration, Weekend Catch-up Sleep, and BMI
Sleep duration was defined based on the responses to the ques-
tion: “How many hours of sleep did you usually get a night 
for the past month? Please respond separately for weekday 
and weekend.” Average sleep duration was a weighted mean 
of sleep durations on weekday and weekend, calculated as (5 × 
weekday-sleep + 2 × weekend-sleep)/7. The difference in sleep 
durations between on weekday and weekend was assessed. The 
presence of weekend catch-up sleep (CUS) was defined when 
sleep duration in the weekend was longer than during weekdays. 
Average sleep duration and weekend CUS was examined as 
both continuous and categorical measures (sleep duration in 
hours, <6, ≥6 to <7, ≥7 to <8, ≥8; weekend CUS in hours, 0, 
>0 to <1, ≥1 to 2, ≥2). The BMI (kg/m2) was calculated from 
self-reported height (cm) and body weight (kg). Obesity was 
defined as BMI ≥25.0 kg/m2.41
Chronotype, Sleep Efficiency, and Sleep-Related Variables
Information on the time-in-bed onset and offset on weekdays 
(workdays) and weekend (free days) was collected. We adopted 
the “midpoint of sleep on free days corrected for sleep extension 
on free days (MSFsc)” as an indicator of chronotype.15,42 MSFsc 
was calculated as follows: MSFsc = midpoint of sleep on free 
days − 0.5 × (sleep duration on free days − [5 × sleep duration on 
workdays + 2 × sleep duration on free days]/7). Sleep efficiency 
(%) was defined by (reported sleep duration/time in bed) × 100, 
and calculated on weekdays and weekend, separately.
Subjective daytime sleepiness was measured with the Epworth 
Sleepiness Scale, and excessive daytime sleepiness was defined 
as a score >10.43 Overall, sleep quality was evaluated using 
the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index: poor sleep quality was a 
score >5. Insomnia was evaluated with the Insomnia Severity 
Index and a score >14 was the diagnostic criteria of moder-
ate-to-severe clinical insomnia.44 Habitual snoring was defined 
when participants reported snoring with a frequency of at least 
4 nights a week. Perceived insufficient sleep was defined when 
there was an unmet need for sleep, based on the response (yes 
or no) to the question, “Do you think your sleep amount is suf-
ficient for your sleep need?”.45
Anxiety, Depression, and Other Measures
The Goldberg anxiety scale and the Patient Health 
Questionnaire-9 depression scale were applied.46,47 The Korean 
version of each scale was validated in Korean adults.48,49 
Anxiety was defined when the anxiety scale score was ≥5. With 
this threshold, sensitivity and specificity was 82.0% and 94.4%, 
respectively.48 Subjects with the depression scale score ≥10 
were considered to have depression, with sensitivity and speci-
ficity of 81.1% and 89.9%.49
Alcohol drinking and smoking status were categorized into 2 
groups (current vs. never or former). Regular physical exercise 
was defined when subjects reported participating in sweat-in-
ducing exercise at least 3 times a week for more than 30 min-
utes for each activity. Self-reported years of education were 
documented and education level was classified into 2 groups 
(<12 education-year vs. ≥12 education-year). Income level was 
divided into 2 groups, higher versus lower than the minimum 
monthly cost of living per person in Korea. Current job status 
was also documented (yes or no).
Statistical Analysis
The primary aim was to test the association of BMI with the 
presence and the amount of weekend CUS, independent of 
average sleep duration, chronotype, and sociodemographic fac-
tors. For group comparisons between subjects with and without 
weekend CUS, a 2-tailed Student’s t-test or chi-square test was 
used for continuous or categorical variables, respectively. We 
performed multiple linear regression, logistic regression, and 
general linear model analysis to test the relationship between

on weekdays (6.9 ± 1.1 hours vs. 7.2 ± 1.3 hours) but had longer 
average sleep duration (7.4 ± 1.1 vs. 7.2 ± 1.3) than the non-
CUS group. The estimated circadian phase was delayed in the 
CUS group, reflected in the difference of MSFsc between 2 
groups (3:58 am ± 96 min vs. 3:25 am ± 108 min). The BMI 
was significantly lower in the CUS group than the non-CUS 
(22.6 ± 2.9 kg/m2 vs. 23.3 ± 3.0 kg/m2). Sleep efficiency as 
well as the presence of daytime sleepiness, insomnia, poor sleep 
quality, anxiety, and depressive mood were similar between the 
2 groups, although the CUS group more frequently reported 
perceived sleep insufficiency (Table 1).
Association of BMI With Average Sleep Duration, Weekend CUS, 
and Chronotype
The unadjusted BMI tended to be inversely related to the 
average sleep duration (23.2 ± 0.2 kg/m2, sleep duration <6 
hour; 23.3 ± 0.1 kg/m2, 6 to <7 hour; 22.9 ± 0.1 kg/m2, 7 
to <8 hour; 23.0 ± 0.1 kg/m2, ≥8 hour; p = .05). However, 
when adjusted for weekend CUS, chronotype, sociode-
mographic factors, and other covariates, the association 
between sleep duration and BMI was neither U-shaped nor 
linear (Table 2).
Weekend CUS was significantly associated with lower BMI, 
independent of age, sex, average sleep duration, and chronotype 
(Table 2). The predicted BMI was 22.8 ± 0.19 kg/m2 in the CUS 
group and 23.1 ± 0.19 kg/m2 in the non-CUS (p = 0.02). The 
decrease in BMI was proportional to the amount of weekend CUS 
(Figure 1)—the more weekend CUS, the lower the BMI. Every 
additional hour of weekend CUS was associated with a decrease of 
0.12 kg/m2 in BMI (95% confidence interval [CI], −0.23 to −0.02).
Weekend CUS tended to modify the association between sleep 
duration and BMI. In the non-CUS group, the subjects with a 
sleep duration shorter than 7 hours had a higher BMI than the 
subjects sleeping more than 7 hours (Figure 2), although the 
interaction between average sleep duration and weekend CUS 
was not significant (p = .59). The presence of weekend CUS 
was significantly associated with lower BMI across the whole 
range of sleep duration (p = .01; Figure 2).
A later chronotype was related to higher BMI, independent of 
age, sex, the presence of weekend CUS, and average sleep dura-
tion (Table 2). MSFsc positively correlated with BMI (β = .11; 
95% CI, 0.01–0.21; p = .040). The interaction between chrono-
type and weekend CUS was not significant (p = .40), although 
later MSFsc tended to associate with higher BMI in the non-
CUS group, but not in the CUS group (Table 3).
Among sociodemographic variables, age, male sex, and lower 
education were associated with higher BMI (Table 2).
DISCUSSION
In this study, we demonstrate an association between weekend 
sleep extension and BMI in a representative largely nonobese adult 
population sample. The predicted BMI in the CUS group was sig-
nificantly lower than the non-CUS group, independent of average 
sleep duration, chronotype, sociodemographic factors, and other 
confounders. The weekend CUS group slept less on weekdays and 
reported unmet sleep needs, a perceived sleep insufficiency, more 
frequently than the non-CUS group, but achieved more sleep 
across the week through weekend sleep extension, indicated by 
the longer average sleep duration. The relative lack of baseline 
obesity in our population more readily differentiates sleep effects.
Compensatory sleep extension on weekends may have a pro-
tective role against weight gain due to chronic partial sleep loss.

rately during workweek and free times in middle aged adults,

demonstrating that a high BMI correlated with short average 
and free time sleep duration.50 Two previous studies on elemen-
tary school children in Asian countries, Hong Kong and South 
Korea, demonstrated that weekend or holiday sleep exten-
sion was associated with a lower risk of being overweight in a 
dose-dependent manner, especially in children who sleep less 
over school days.37,38 Our results are largely concordant, but in 
adult population.
Protective biologic effects of weekend CUS may extend 
beyond obesity. As reported previously,32 in our study pop-
ulation, an additional hour of weekend CUS was related to a 
decrease in the prevalence of hypertension (OR, .83; 95% CI, 
0.72–0.95), more strongly among subjects reporting perceived 
sleep insufficiency (OR, .61; 95% CI, 0.42–0.82) than those 
without sleep insufficiency (OR, .95; 95% CI, 0.80–1.12). 
Interindividual differences in sleep need and in vulnerability to 
sleep loss is widely acknowledged.51,52 Among subjects having 
similar amounts of sleep, those who complain of unmet sleep 
need are likely to require more sleep or be more vulnerable to 
sleep loss than those who do not, and eventually get more ben-
efit from weekend sleep extension. In this study population, 
the predicted BMI was 22.7 ± 0.3 kg/m2 and 23.0 ± 0.3 kg/m2 
in those with and without weekend CUS, respectively, among 
subjects (N = 679) who reported perceived sleep insufficiency 
(p = .18; data not shown in the results). Perceived insufficient 
sleep was related to shorter average sleep duration (6.7 ± 1.2 
hour), and to sleep curtailment even with weekend sleep exten-
sion (6.9 ± 1.1 hours).
Weekend CUS should reasonably be considered an independ-
ent factor in epidemiological investigations. In most studies 
concerning the effect of sleep on body weight or obesity, sleep 
duration was determined by participants’ reports on the average 
or usual amount of sleep a night or 24-hour.6,7,9–12 In this setting, 
participants may have reported sleep duration as the amount 
of sleep on a weekday, rather than an average value across a 
week or sleep on a weekend. A few studies considered only 
workday sleep duration.7,53 Consequently, sleep duration might 
have been systematically underestimated, considering the high 
prevalence of weekend CUS in this study and others.15,50 This 
problem might have been overcome in other studies that used 
a weighted average of reported sleep duration on weekday and 
weekend.8,50,54–56 Studies which perform actigraphy for epide-
miological investigations could evaluate objective versus sub-
jective dimensions of weekend CUS, to determine if they are 
biologically equivalent.14,56,57
The unadjusted difference in BMI between the weekend CUS 
and non-CUS group was relatively small (0.6 kg/m2) compared 
with the association of habitual sleep duration and BMI. In 
studies of western populations, BMI in the group of short sleep 
duration (<5–6 hours/night) was usually higher than the refer-
ence group (7–8 hours/night) by more than 1.0 kg/m2.8–10,13,14 
Achieving sufficient amount of nocturnal sleep is still impor-
tant to maintain cardiometabolic health. Weekend CUS could 
be a quick fix to compensate sleep loss over the week but is 
not an ultimate solution for chronic sleep loss, reflected in the 
finding that the CUS group had longer average sleep duration 
than the non-CUS. If average sleep duration over the week is far 
below the optimal amount even with weekend sleep extension, 
the benefits from the weekend CUS would likely dissipate.
Chronotype, especially the evening type, is related to meta-
bolic disturbances including obesity.15,40,58 Mechanisms include 
circadian misalignment, partial sleep deprivation (at least dur-
ing workdays), light exposure at night per se, and nocturnal 
eating.15,58,59 A late chronotype leads to weekend sleep exten-
sion.15,39 Therefore, it is mandatory to adjust circadian prefer-
ence in the analysis of relationship between sleep duration and 
body weight and the effect of weekend CUS. In this study, a

later chronotype via the MSFsc positively correlated with BMI 
and obesity (Table 2). However, the association was attenuated 
in the weekend CUS group (Table 3), which implies that the 
weekend sleep extension may alleviate the undesirable effects 
of at least modest degrees of a late chronotype. There is prob-
ably a trade-off between relieving homeostatic sleep pressure 
and worsening circadian misalignment with long sleep duration 
weekend sleeping in, as extreme late chronotype individual can 
and often do.
Another strategy to pay off sleep debt incurred in daily life 
is to take a nap. Unlike the favorable results of weekend CUS 
in the current study, several studies demonstrated a negative 
influence of daytime napping on individual health including 
increased all-cause or cardiovascular mortality, obesity, dia-
betes, impaired cognition, and depression.33–36 The incongru-
ous influences of weekend sleep extension and napping can be 
explained by several mechanisms: (1) circadian misalignment 
effects; (2) daytime napping is usually short and fragmented 
sleep, but night sleep extension is a part of natural sleep 
aligned with circadian rhythm and likely to be considerably 
longer and more consolidated; (3) type of sleep (REM rich 
during extension, NREM during napping); (4) driving mecha-
nisms—more likely to be pathological sleep inducing daytime 
napping, while restriction of normal sleep for sleep exten-
sion.60 In epidemiologic studies, napping is usually defined by 
the subjects’ reports on the presence and frequency of habitual 
napping. The driving mechanism, a nap by choice to satiate 
sleep needs versus a nap due to an inability to maintain wake-
fulness, is often not well characterized.33–36 Considering the 
plausible cognitive benefits of napping by choice,31,61 future 
epidemiologic investigations may usefully attempt to deline-
ate underlying driving mechanisms for napping, to define the 
type of nap, and to identify napping as a compensation for 
sleep debt.
Despite the novelty and strength of design and finding, our 
study has several limitations. The BMI was calculated from 
reported, not measured, height and weight. In previous epi-
demiologic studies, self-reported BMI was highly correlated 
with measured BMI but generally underestimated compared 
with a measured one, and systematic errors were greater in 
certain groups (older subjects, shorter men, and heavier 
women).62–64 Therefore, the use of reported BMI is likely 
to underestimate obesity or overweight prevalence, but will 
produce minimal bias to explore the association of BMI and 
other conditions.63,64 Furthermore, in this study the non-CUS 
group was older and had a higher BMI than the CUS, which 
suggests that the reported BMI would have been underesti-
mated more in the non-CUS group. The association between 
weekend CUS and BMI was undeterred by the possibility that 
the measurement errors of BMI contributed to the attenua-
tion of BMI difference between the 2 groups. Other limita-
tions are as follows. Information on calorie intake and detailed 
quantitative parameters of physical activity are unavailable, 
which are important contributors to body weight. No objective 
measure of sleep duration and quality was available. Weekend 
CUS could be proposed as a simple population-level strat-
egy to counteract cardiometabolic derangements induced by 
every day sleep loss, but our data cannot determine the opti-
mal “dose” of CUS, or the optimal amount of social jetlag 
to balance biological and social needs.15 Any role of gene–
environment interactions also needs to be assessed-if specific 
obesity or circadian genetic polymorphisms modify the effect 
of weekend CUS on obesity.
CONCLUSION
We demonstrate a positive dose-dependent association between 
weekend CUS and body weight in an adult general popula-
tion. This association was independent of average sleep dura-
tion across a week and chronotype. The association of a later 
chronotype with higher BMI was attenuated by weekend CUS, 
a desirable effect of social jetlag. Sleep extension is an applica-
ble population-level strategy. A deeper understanding of biolog-
ical mechanisms is desirable.
