Abstract
Prior to 2001 there was no standard for early management of severe sepsis and septic shock in the emergency
department. In the presence of standard or usual care, the prevailing mortality was over 40-50 %. In response, a
systems-based approach, similar to that in acute myocardial infarction, stroke and trauma, called early goal-directed
therapy was compared to standard care and this clinical trial resulted in a significant mortality reduction. Since the
publication of that trial, similar outcome benefits have been reported in over 70 observational and randomized
controlled studies comprising over 70,000 patients. As a result, early goal-directed therapy was largely incorporated
into the first 6 hours of sepsis management (resuscitation bundle) adopted by the Surviving Sepsis Campaign and
disseminated internationally as the standard of care for early sepsis management. Recently a trio of trials (ProCESS,
ARISE, and ProMISe), while reporting an all-time low sepsis mortality, question the continued need for all of the
elements of early goal-directed therapy or the need for protocolized care for patients with severe and septic shock. A
review of the early hemodynamic pathogenesis, historical development, and definition of early goal-directed
therapy, comparing trial conduction methodology and the changing landscape of sepsis mortality, are essential
for an appropriate interpretation of these trials and their conclusions.
Background
The early physiologic-hemodynamic response to severe
sepsis and septic shock
In animal and human models of early sepsis, global tis-
sue hypoxia results from hemodynamic perturbations
that create an imbalance between systemic oxygen deliv-
ery and demands. These perturbations can include hypo-
volemia, decreased vasomotor tone, decreased arterial
oxygen content, myocardial depression, increased meta-
bolic demands, and impairment of systemic oxygen
utilization
via
microcirculatory
or
mitochondrial
derangements (cytopathic tissue hypoxia) [1]. A critical
decrease in systemic oxygen delivery is followed by an
increase in the systemic oxygen extraction ratio and a
decrease in mixed or central venous (SvO2 or ScvO2)
oxygen saturation. Anaerobic metabolism ensues when
the limits of this compensatory mechanism cannot
maintain systemic oxygen consumption leading to lac-
tate production [2]. The final, and often terminal, stage
is an impairment of systemic oxygen utilization. Patients
in this stage have elevated ScvO2, increased lactate, and
decreased systemic oxygen consumption (Additional file
1: Figure S1).
As
a
result
of
this
early
response,
distinct
hemodynamic phenotypes emerge. Characterizing pa-
tients by distinct hemodynamic phenotypes using ScvO2,
lactate, and blood pressure provides diagnostic, thera-
peutic, and
prognostic
staging
of sepsis for study

 comparisons. These hemodynamic phenotypes reflect
distinct stages along a continuum of disease whether
pre-hospital, in the emergency department (ED), on gen-
eral practice floors or in the intensive care unit (ICU)
setting.
The history and development of early goal-directed ther-
apy (EGDT)
Beginning in the early 1990s, the EGDT Collaborative
Group challenged the paradigm of sepsis care as an
“ICU disease” by applying similar urgent diagnostic and
therapeutic principles as used for acute myocardial in-
farction, stroke, and trauma at the point of presentation
in the ED. At that time, no structured formal worldwide
accepted protocols for early identification and treatment
of patients with sepsis existed. The observations of high
mortality, fractured, and unstructured care triggered a
series of investigations using a system-based approach to
identify delays in patient diagnosis and care before hos-
pital admission. Combining system issues with the early
pathogenesis and natural progression of sepsis required
the development of unique diagnostic and risk stratifica-
tion criteria to detect patients at risk and most likely to
benefit (Fig. 1) [3].
From EGDT to ProCESS, ARISE and ProMISe
EGDT is comprised of early identification of high-risk
patients, appropriate cultures, source control, and ad-
ministration of appropriate antibiotics. This is followed
by early hemodynamic optimization of oxygen delivery,
guided by preload (central venous pressure (CVP) or
surrogate targeting with fluids), afterload (mean arterial
pressure (MAP) targeted with vasopressors), arterial oxy-
gen content (packed red blood cells and/or oxygen sup-
plementation),
contractility
(inotropic
agents),
and
decreasing oxygen consumption (mechanical ventilation
and sedation), and guided by ScvO2. These principles
were essentially best practice recommendations for sep-
sis management in the ICU setting (Fig. 1) [4].
After observing a local hospital mortality of over 50 %
for severe sepsis and septic shock, an institutional qual-
ity improvement initiative led to the randomized con-
trolled trial of EGDT between 1997 and 2000 [3]. After
validity, reliability, and feasibility testing across multiple
healthcare settings both nationally and internationally
for over a decade, EGDT became part of the fundamen-
tal components of the sepsis resuscitation bundle for the
Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC), the National Quality
Forum and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services
[5].
Since the EGDT publication, significant scientific inter-
est was generated to "disassemble or unbundle" early sep-
sis resuscitation and question the value of its individual
components [6, 7]. Even though EGDT was based on a
series of investigations to systematically improve sepsis
outcomes, it has been inappropriately characterized as a
hemodynamic optimization study driven by CVP and
ScvO2 as targets for early shock resolution [8–11]. There
was also the additional question of its external validity be-
cause it was a single center study with an “unusually high”
control group mortality of 46.5 %. Recently, a "trio of tri-
als" which examined versions of EGDT called ProCESS
(Protocol-Based Care for Early Septic Shock), ARISE
(Australasian Resuscitation in Sepsis Evaluation) and
ProMISe (Protocolized Management in Sepsis) were pub-
lished from a related consortium of investigators [12–14].
The trio of trials of EGDT reported an unprecedented
all-time low in sepsis mortality for all treatment groups
compared to historical controls (Table 1). However, they
concluded: "EGDT does not show improved survival for
patients randomized to receive EGDT compared to usual
care or to less invasive alternative hemodynamic resusci-
tation protocols. EGDT is, however, associated with in-
creased admission to ICU. Our findings do not support
the systematic use of EGDT in the management of all
patients with septic shock or its inclusion in the Surviv-
ing Sepsis Campaign guidelines” [15]. The purpose of
this review is to provide the reader with the critical in-
formation needed to objectively interpret the purpose,
methodology, results, and conclusion of the trio of
EGDT trials [16–19].
Review
Enrollment procedures and logistics
The location, number of centers, hospital setting and
size, and number of ED visits for the EGDT and trio
of EGDT trials are noted in Table 2 and Additional
file 1, Table S1. Trials were primarily conducted in
academic/tertiary care centers, where higher patient
volumes are associated with better outcomes [20].
The trio of EGDT trials began 8 years after comple-
tion of the EGDT trial, were conducted over a 5-year
period, and published more than 14 years after the
EGDT
trial.
This
time
period
also
paralleled
the
introduction (2004) and two revisions of the SSC
guidelines in 2008 and 2013 [5].
Eligible patients were excluded in 10.4 %, 65 %, 42.7 %,
and 55.4 % of the EGDT, ProCESS, ARISE, and ProMISe
trials, respectively. The enrollment rate was 7 patients
per month for the EGDT trial compared with 0.5 to 0.7
patients per month per center in the trio of EGDT trials
(Table 2). Daytime and weekday enrollment (as in the
ProMISe trial) is associated with lower mortality when
compared to nighttime and weekends [21, 22]. High ex-
clusion rates, convenient enrollment, low patient per site
relative to high-volume recruitment, and a 5-year dur-
ation of enrollment methodologically challenges the ex-
ternal validity of even large randomized trials [19].

 Recognition of Poor Quality of Care in the ED 
Prolonged ED length of stays negatively impact outcome for septic shock patients. [109, 110]
Nguyen et.al. validated the work of Drs. Safar and Frank who taught that critical care had no 
boundaries and early care significantly impacts the progression of organ failure and mortality 
before ICU admission.[111-113]
Early Identification Triggers of Infection
The ED was a major portal for hospital admissions. The first study using SIRS in the ED revealed 
that the more SIRS criteria, the longer the ED length of stay, greater degree of admission, 
increased length of hospital stays and costs.[114, 115]
Risk Stratification - Lactate, Hypotension and Fluid Challenge
In the transition from SIRS to severe disease, early cardiovascular insufficiency is the most 
significant organ dysfunction.[114, 116] The first investigation of SIRS and lactate in the ED 
revealed high degree of sensitivity for illness severity and high mortality. The early detection of 
cryptic shock prevents triage errors and sudden cardiopulmonary complications.[117, 118]
Hypotension, the response to a fluid challenge and shock index were risk stratification methods 
that could detect early cardiovascular insufficiency.[119-122]
Antibiotics and Source Control
In the experimental model, survival rates are superior combined therapy (antibiotics and 
hemodynamic optimization).[123] By expert opinion and observation, antibiotic administration is 
most beneficial within 6 hours.[124, 125]
Hemodynamic Optimization
Global tissue hypoxia can persist with normal vital signs. Early resolution of shock and global tissue 
hypoxia improves outcomes [11, 126] The optimization of preload (CVP), afterload (MAP) and 
balancing DO2 (arterial oxygen content and cardiac output) with VO2 as reflected by ScvO2 and 
serial lactates (lactate clearance) reflect one-half a century of investigations.[127-131] The concept 
of EGDT and the importance of the first 6 hours was examined in cardiac arrest, undifferentiated 
shock, trauma and cardiac failure before sepsis in the ED [132].

 Baseline enrollment criteria (SIRS, lactate, and blood
pressure)
An increased respiratory rate, lower partial pressure of
carbon dioxide, and decreased temperature were the more
prominent
systemic
inflammatory
response
syndrome
(SIRS) criteria in the EGDT study patients. Additionally, the
EGDT study patients had a greater degree of metabolic
acidosis and lower ScvO2, reflecting greater shock severity
(Table 3) [23–25]. While lactate remains an excellent early
screening tool, the incidence of a normal lactate level in
septic shock is frequent, necessitating an alternative method
of risk stratification such as hypotension [26, 27]. On the
other hand, intermediate lactate levels (2–4 mM/L) are also
associated with increased mortality which is significantly
reduced (19 % odds ratio for hospital mortality) with proto-
colized care [28–32].
A hypotensive episode is associated with an in-
creased risk of death and the response to an adequate
fluid
challenge
improves
upon
this
discriminatory
value [32, 33]. The fluid challenge requirement of
EGDT (20–30 mL/kg) after randomization into the
study was significantly higher than the 1 liter fixed
bolus over 60 min prior to randomization used in the
trio of EGDT trials (Table 4, Additional file 1: Figure
S3 ). Patients enrolled in these trials because they
remained hypotensive after 1 liter of crystalloid may not

20–30 mL/kg of fluids (Tables 4 and 5).
Methodology—ED presentation, duration of stay and
blinding of care
Randomization and protocol completion was exclusively
performed in the ED (minimum of 7–8 h) in the EGDT
trial to reflect the reality of care and maximize external
validity [28]. This compares to a length of stay of less
than 3 h in the ED and the remainder in the inpatient
setting in the trio of EGDT trials (Table 2). National ini-
tiatives to admit patients to the hospital within 4 h of
ED presentation (ProMISe and ARISE) may have im-
proved sepsis care [34, 35]. It has also been noted in the

 USA that early ICU admission not only improves the
processes of care but contributes to diminishing mortal-
ity [36, 37].
In the EGDT trial, the admitting inpatient clinicians
(ICU) were completely blinded to the randomized treat-
ment group in the ED and clinical variables related to the
study during the 72-h follow-up [3, 18]. This included
blinding to lactate (and lactate clearance) as well as ScvO2
values over 72 h as they were not a standard of care and
not readily available in the chart. In contrast, the care pro-
vided in the trio of EGDT trials was unblinded. The ad-
verse hemodynamic or sudden cardiopulmonary events
that occur as a result of the transition and turnover of care
from ED to ICU are diminished if care is unblinded and
provided by a coordinated research or inpatient team [18].
Antibiotic therapy
The encouragement or requisite for antibiotic adminis-
tration prior to enrollment in the trio of EGDT trials is
a significant intervention (Additional file 1: Table S4).
An 8.5 % increase in mortality for a 6-h delay or a 7.6 %
increase in mortality (septic shock) for each hour of delay

 administration is further enhanced by antibiotic appro-
priateness [38, 40].
Screening for SIRS criteria, lactate levels, fluid challenge
(for hypotension), and antibiotics was a requisite for site
enrollment at the centers of the trio of EGDT trials. These
interventions can alter the natural trajectory of sepsis
progressing to more severe disease, thus mitigating the
need for aggressive intervention.
Fluid and vasopressor therapy
From hospital arrival to the end of the 6-h study period
the total fluid volume given ranged from 3.5 to 5.5 liters
for the EGDT and trio of trials study groups. Overall, be-
cause of the greater lead time prior to enrollment in the
trio of EGDT trials, the total volume given was actually
similar to the EGDT study treatment group. The com-
parative differences in fluid therapy were 1482 mL
(42.4 %), 697 mL (16 %), 175 mL (4.1 %), and 229 mL
(4.4 %) between the EGDT and usual or control care treat-
ment groups in the EGDT, ProCESS, ARISE, and ProMISe
trials, respectively (Table 4).
In the EGDT study, the greater volume therapy or
treatment effect during the 6 hours of resuscitation was
associated with a greater reduction (13.8 %) in vasopres-
sor therapy, less volume therapy (2 liters or 23 %) and
lower mechanical ventilation rates (14.2 %) between the
EGDT and control group during the subsequent 6- to
72-h time period.
Early and more frequent administration of vasopressors
in the trio of EGDT trials may result in a hemodynamic
phenotype of "vasodilatory septic shock" which is as-
sociated with a lower mortality risk as described by
Hernandez et al. [41]. Waechter et al. further report that
vasopressor use in the first hour may be associated with in-
creased mortality in patients of greater illness severity [42].
Central venous catheterization
In the EGDT trial, the timing of central venous catheter
(CVC) placement was earlier compared to the trio of
EGDT trials because it was an emergent standard of care
provided in both treatment groups. As a result, the lower
baseline CVP and ScvO2 values in both treatment groups
are more consistent with experimental models of sepsis
where hypovolemia is predominant (Table 3) [1]. The
normal CVP (>10 mmHg) at study entry in the ARISE
trial suggests adequate volume resuscitation at enrollment.
CVC placement rates were 57.9 %, 61.9 %, and 50.9 % in
the control groups of the ProCESS, ARISE, and ProMISe
trials, respectively (Additional file 1: Table S2). These
CVC placement rates exceed the "real life" CVC place-
ment rate of 35.4 % noted in large observational quality
improvement studies where associated mortality reduction
is from 47.7 % to 29.5 % (almost identical to the EGDT
study) [43]. CVC insertion (within 12 h of diagnosis) and
attainment of the target CVP ≥8 mm Hg has been associ-
ated with lower in-hospital death [43, 44]. The CVC place-
ment rates in the trio of EGDT trials potentially narrows
the treatment effect between the studied groups.
Central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2)
Similar to a low CVP, a low ScvO2 (<40 %) is a consist-
ent finding in experimental models and observations of
early human sepsis [1, 45]. The lower ScvO2 values in
the EGDT trial reflect earlier CVC placement, greater
shock severity, or imbalances between DO2 (oxygen de-
livery) and VO2 (oxygen consumption) before corrective
interventions [26, 46, 47]. The frequency of ScvO2 less
than 70 % has been reported as 36 % to 45.4 % in ED
patients and up to 53 % of ICU admissions. ScvO2
below 70 % upon ICU admission is associated with a
10.4 % increase in hospital mortality [26, 48].
Did the trio of EGDT trials shed light on the role of
ScvO2 as an important endpoint of EGDT when the ini-
tial mean ScvO2 was 71 %, 72 %, and 70 % in the
ProCESS, ARISE, and ProMISe trials, respectively, along
with a normal CVP (Table 3)? In the EGDT trial, the
mean (and median) ScvO2 of 49 % at randomization was
2 standard deviations below the target ScvO2 of 70 %. In
other words, 97.5 % of enrolled patients actually required
specific steps to normalize ScvO2. Assuming that ScvO2
values were normally distributed—and they were reported
and analyzed in the trio of EGDT trials as parametric
(normally distributed) data—the median value for ScvO2
would also be greater than or equal to 70 %, indicating
that half of the patients had a normal baseline ScvO2 or
reached the targeted endpoint of EGDT at the time of
randomization. Assuming that randomization was effect-
ive in the trio of EGDT trials, half of patients in the usual
care arms of the studies also would not have “required”
specific steps of EGDT to reach this endpoint.
Intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis was a component of
the trio of EGDT trials. ITT analysis is limited when the
endpoint of the variable in question (ScvO2 and CVP) is
achieved at the time of randomization [17, 49]. A meth-
odologically
more
appropriate
investigation
would
randomize patients who required normalization of ScvO2
(or with low baseline ScvO2) to receive EGDT versus usual
or other forms of care. Unfortunately, without having a
CVC inserted, the investigators of the trio of EGDT trials
did not have a mechanism for screening those patients
with low ScvO2 after meeting the same enrollment criteria
as the EGDT trial [17].
Myocardial dysfunction
Myocardial dysfunction can be present in up to 15 % of
septic shock patients, and more frequent in the presence
of cardiovascular co-morbidities [50, 51]. In addition,
Nguyen et al. Critical Care  (2016) 20:160 
Page 8 of 16
 greater use of mechanical ventilation can potentiate ad-
verse heart–lung interactions necessitating cardiovascular
manipulation (Table 4) [52]. The hemodynamic phenotype
of myocardial dysfunction (low ScvO2, increased CVP and
lactate) may be absent on physical examination but is as-
sociated with increased mortality [53–57]. Inotropic ther-
apy is associated with increased fluid administration as a
result of reducing CVP secondary to lowering ventricular
end-diastolic pressure (improving compliance) and allow-
ing for fluid administration [58]. Ultrasound assessment
has also emerged as a common tool in the ED manage-
ment of shock. Recent literature suggests that left ven-
tricular strain seen on cardiac ultrasound during sepsis
is associated with a decreased ScvO2 and increased lac-
tate [59]. The use of cardiac ultrasound has therefor a
potential impact on therapeutic interventions used. The
trio of EGDT trials did not formally discuss the use of
ultrasound or other technologies (i.e., pulmonary artery
catheter) and their treatment effects on usual care.
Mechanical ventilation
The greater need for mechanical ventilation in the EGDT
trial patients compared to the trio of trials is multifactorial
and provides unique therapeutic and outcome dimensions
(Table 4) [52, 60–62]. At enrollment, there were greater de-
grees of respiratory demands (increased respiratory rate
and decreased partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2)
and increasing shock severity (increased lactate and de-
creased ScvO2) in the EGDT trial patients (Table 3). Pa-
tients with acute pulmonary edema were excluded from the
trio of EGDT trials without specifying a cardiogenic or
non-cardiogenic etiology (acute lung injury (ALI)).
Mechanical ventilation alters the hemodynamic pheno-
type in severe sepsis and septic shock compared to a spon-
taneously breathing patient [24, 46, 60, 63]. While ScvO2
generally increases upon the introduction of mechanical
ventilation, hemodynamic perturbations resulting from ad-
verse heart–lung interactions may trigger more therapeutic
interventions [63]. These can range from modifying the
fraction of inspired oxygen, positive end-expiratory pres-
sure, fluid administration, vasoactive agents, and decreasing
the work of breathing after intubation [46, 47, 64].
Normalization of SvO2 even up to 47 h after disease onset
is associated with improved outcomes and decreased dur-
ation of mechanical ventilation in the setting of ALI [56].
Decreased duration of mechanical ventilation is associated
with more efficient and definitive shock resolution as noted
up to 72 h in the EGDT group of the original trial when
compared to the control group [3, 65].
The SSC database from 2005 to 2008 reports a mechan-
ical ventilation rate of 52.4 % (7877/15,022 patients) which
is almost identical to the EGDT study (Table 4). Mortality
rates in this report were 48.3, 45.7, and 33.0 % in
mechanically ventilated patients with ALI, without ALI,
and without mechanical ventilation, respectively. In a co-
hort study of the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project
Nationwide Inpatient Sample, Attaway et al. also reported
that mortality decreased more in sepsis patients requiring
mechanical ventilation (n = 884,848; from 64.1 % to 39.7 %;
p < 0.05) compared to those that did not require mechan-
ical ventilation (n = 6,963,920; 14.8 % to 9.0 %; p < 0.05).
They specifically stated that “this occurred over a decade
following the introduction of EGDT (2001 to 2012)” [60].
This 24.4 % reduction in mortality is multifactorial, with
protective lung strategies accounting for 8.7 % and the re-
mainder attributed to other interventions such as EGDT
[61]. The EGDT trial is unique because it was conducted
before the introduction of protective lung strategies and al-
ternative fluid management strategies [66, 67].
Corticosteroids
Adrenal dysfunction has been found to be present in up to
19 % of vasopressor-dependent patients following adequate
volume resuscitation in the ED [68]. Over 8 % of all treat-
ment groups in the ProCESS trial received steroids prior to
randomization [12]. In the ARISE trial, 36.9 % of the EGDT
group versus 35.9 % of the usual care group received ster-
oid therapy within 72 h due to co-enrollment in a double-
blind randomized trial of corticosteroids in septic shock as
noted in the supplemental material of the study [13]. In the
ProMISe trial [14], 4–5 % and 11–12 % of both treatment
groups received steroids at baseline and within 6 h, respect-
ively (Table 4). While the impact of steroids on mortality
draws continued debate, recent evidence suggests that early
treatment (within 9 h) decreases the vasopressor require-
ment and positively impacts outcome, especially in patients
with higher illness severity [69, 70]. The use of steroids for
vasopressor refractory shock was absent in the EGDT trial.
Defining usual care and other influences on mortality
The trio of EGDT trials was conducted during a period of
diminishing sepsis mortality (Table 1) [5, 71, 72]. Quality
improvement initiatives and other technologies imple-
mented over this time include pre-hospital management
[73], healthcare provider education [74], sepsis and anti-
biotic administration alerts [75], ultrasound, stroke volume,
or pulse pressure variation [76–78], lactate clearance [79],
scoring systems [80], rapid response teams [81], telemedi-
cine [82], around the clock intensivist staffing [83], early re-
ferral to larger hospitals [20], palliative care [84], state-wide
sepsis initiatives [16], improved coding [85], and documen-
tation [86].
As a result of the ubiquitous nature of the SSC over the
last decade, sepsis protocols or quality improvement ini-
tiatives were evident in a majority of the ProCESS trial
sites before or during conduct of the trio of EGDT trials
(Additional file 1: Figure S2) [87, 88]. The Sepsis Six and
Nguyen et al. Critical Care  (2016) 20:160 
Page 9 of 16
 SEPSIS KILLS pathway were nationally implemented prior
to or paralleling the ProMISe and ARISE trials and have
been associated with increased resuscitation bundle compli-
ance and improved mortality [89, 90]. These generically
comprise administering high-flow oxygen, obtaining blood
cultures, administering broad spectrum antibiotics and
intravenous fluid challenges, and measuring serum lactate
and hemoglobin along with accurate hourly urine output.
The administration of supplemental oxygen can signifi-
cantly increase and potentially normalizes ScvO2 even
before enrollment [47, 64]. This is followed by reassess-
ment and early referral to the ICU.
Compliance to the resuscitation bundle elements (lactate,
cultures, antibiotics, fluid challenge, and even CVC
placement) in the usual care or control groups was over
50 % in each of the trio of EGDT trials. This resulted
from CVC placement as a standard of care by usual
care or control care clinicians. Large observational studies
have shown that even when resuscitation bundle com-
pliance rates improve from 7 % to 29.2 %, mortality is
reduced from 45.7 % to 29.5 % for an absolute risk re-
duction of 16.5 % and a relative risk reduction of 36 %
(p < 0.001; Additional File 1: Figure S2) [91].
The trio of EGDT trials did not examine the impact of
delayed care. A significant mortality reduction has been
observed even with significant delays (up to 12 h) before
initiating
EGDT
[92–94].
Patients
could
potentially
receive usual or control arm care during the 6-h study
period of the trio of EGDT trials and then receive
delayed EGDT or a facsimile, thus altering the treatment
effect between groups.
What is the true baseline, control group or usual care
mortality?
Mortality from severe sepsis and septic shock over the
decade prior to and paralleling the conduct of the trio of
EGDT trials has undergone a consistent and significant
decrease (Table 1). For the most common cause of sepsis
requiring hospital admission (pneumonia) in the USA,
inpatient mortality rates have decreased 45 % among adults
between 2002 and 2012 [95]. Whether protocolized care
study designs were quasi experimental, prospective obser-
vational, prospective with historical controls, or retrospect-
ive
or
randomized
controlled,
an
historical
baseline
mortality approaches 40–50 % (Table 1). These findings are
consistent with a Sepsis International Consensus Defini-
tions Task Force who performed a systematic review
comprising 52 studies and 166,479 patients (1993–2015)
and reported a septic shock-associated crude mortality of
46.5 % [96]. This reference mortality is identical to the
original EGDT trial [3], which supports its external validity

 and is nearly twice the mortality of the trio of EGDT trials
(Table 1) [12–14]. Using this reference mortality as usual or
control group mortality, it is clear that mortality has dimin-
ished over the last decade. This significant change in mor-
tality, if not accounted for, increases the likelihood of an
underpowered trial [19].
What is the real baseline mortality in the trio of EGDT
trials? When the observed hospital mortality is subtracted
from the predicted mortality using the baseline mean Acute
Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II
scores, a relative risk mortality reduction of 45–51.5 %
in ProCESS, 25.2–30.9 % in ARISE, and 24.6–25.6 % in
ProMISe is seen across all treatment groups. These
mortality projections similarly compare to the original
EGDT trial’s relative mortality reduction of 24.3 % be-
tween treatment and control groups (Table 6).
Hemodynamic subgroups (phenotypes)
Early risk stratification of high-risk patients using SIRS,
lactate screening, and fluid challenge was a standard of
care in all treatment groups in the trio of EGDT trials.
Lactate screening not only provides earlier detection of
occult shock, but therapeutically alters the natural history
of sepsis by decreasing early cardiopulmonary events,
which can occur in up to 20 % of patients [3, 97, 98].
These events associated with increased mortality can
range from hypotension, respiratory deterioration, and
cardiac arrhythmias, to cardiac arrest even after the 6-h
trial period and ICU admission [98, 99]. Early lactate
screening further leads to a reduction in the time to over-
all diagnostic results, intravenous fluids, ED care, and ICU
admission. The estimated mortality reduction attributed
to lactate screening approaches 11 % [100, 101].
In the EGDT trial, the baseline lactate level was almost
2 mM/L higher than in the trio of EGDT trials. The num-
ber of patients with a lactate less than 4 mM/L was 21 %,
45 %, 54 %, and 35.4 % in the EGDT, ProCESS, ARISE,
and ProMISe trials, respectively (Table 3) [3, 12–14]. In
the ProCESS trial, the number of patients with a lactate
greater than 5.3 mM/L was 12 % higher in the EGDT
group compared to the two other study groups (p = 0.05).
The combination of a high lactate and low ScvO2 at
baseline comprise a hemodynamic phenotype that is in-
dependently associated with greater degrees of systemic
inflammation, organ dysfunction, and higher mortality
[31, 97, 100, 102–105] (Fig. 2). When this hemodynamic
phenotype is adjusted for organ dysfunction (lactate/
APACHE II ratio) at baseline, patients in the EGDT trial
are also of higher acute illness severity compared to the
trio of EGDT trials (Fig. 2) [26, 27, 48, 106].
Conclusions
EGDT has been shown to have internal and external valid-
ity in reducing mortality for the treatment of severe sepsis
and septic shock. The various approaches examined by
the trio of EGDT trials suggest that alternative strategies
can provide an equal reduction in mortality. However, as a
result of multiple methodological differences when com-
pared to the original EGDT trial (including undefined
usual care), the external validity of these alternative strat-
egies remain to be determined. The combination of a
diminishing treatment effect between these alternative
strategies and EGDT, along with a global reduction in sep-
sis mortality over the last 15 years, can render even well-
conducted control trials underpowered and inconclusive.
The trio of EGDT trials provides enormous insight into
explaining the discrepancy in trials attempting to replicate
a previously positive trial over a decade later. It has been
shown that large prospective observational studies which
have confirmed the external validity and reliability of the
EGDT trial provide an equally reliable scientific alternative
to randomized control trials [17–19, 107, 108].
In this era of global reductions in sepsis mortality, cli-
nicians should view EGDT as a verb (series of actions)
rather than a noun. Future research should focus on the
precision for using invasive or non-invasive approaches
at the initial presentation of high risk patients.
