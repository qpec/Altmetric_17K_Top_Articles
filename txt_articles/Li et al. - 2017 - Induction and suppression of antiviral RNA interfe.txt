Abstract
Influenza A virus (IAV) causes annual epidemics and occasional pandemics, and is one of the 
best-characterized human RNA viral pathogens1. However, a physiologically relevant role for the 
RNA interference (RNAi) suppressor activity of the IAV non-structural protein 1 (NS1), reported 
over a decade ago2, remains unknown3. Plant and insect viruses have evolved diverse virulence

 proteins to suppress RNAi as their hosts produce virus-derived small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) 
that direct specific antiviral defence4–7 by an RNAi mechanism dependent on the slicing activity 
of Argonaute proteins (AGOs)8,9. Recent studies have documented induction and suppression of 
antiviral RNAi in mouse embryonic stem cells and suckling mice10,11. However, it is still under 
debate whether infection by IAV or any other RNA virus that infects humans induces and/or 
suppresses antiviral RNAi in mature mammalian somatic cells12–21. Here, we demonstrate that 
mature human somatic cells produce abundant virus-derived siRNAs co-immunoprecipitated with 
AGOs in response to IAV infection. We show that the biogenesis of viral siRNAs from IAV 
double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) precursors in infected cells is mediated by wild-type human Dicer 
and potently suppressed by both NS1 of IAV as well as virion protein 35 (VP35) of Ebola and 
Marburg filoviruses. We further demonstrate that the slicing catalytic activity of AGO2 inhibits 
IAV and other RNA viruses in mature mammalian cells, in an interferon-independent fashion. 
Altogether, our work shows that IAV infection induces and suppresses antiviral RNAi in 
differentiated mammalian somatic cells.
Virus-derived siRNAs (vsiRNAs) serve as both the molecular marker for the induction of 
antiviral RNAi and the specificity determinants of the defence mechanism5–7. As Dicer 
products, vsiRNAs are 21–24 nucleotides (nt) long and form short, perfect, base-paired RNA 
duplexes with 2 nt 3′ overhangs5–7. However, sequencing of total small RNAs from a range 
of mature mammalian cells infected with diverse human RNA viruses over the past decade 
has failed to detect the production of a significant amount of vsiRNAs12–16,18. It is known 
that AGOs selectively bind to Dicer products, and several virus-encoded suppressors of 
RNAi (VSRs) act to inhibit the biogenesis or Argonaute loading of vsiRNAs5–7. Thus, 
mammalian vsiRNAs may become readily detectable by deep sequencing when small RNAs 
are enriched first by Argonaute co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) from mammalian cells 
infected with a mutant RNA virus deleted of its VSR gene. Here, we use this strategy to 
search for vsiRNAs from IAV-infected human somatic cells. NS1 of IAV suppresses both 
antiviral RNAi in Drosophila cells and engineered RNAi in plant and mammalian 
cells2,22–25, and shares strong structural similarity3 in dsRNA binding with the nodaviral 
VSR B2 proteins, known to inhibit the biogenesis of vsiRNAs in animal cells10,11,26. IAV 
contains a negative-strand RNA genome divided into eight segments, and NS1, encoded by 
the smallest genome segment, is multifunctional and essential for in vivo infection and 
virulence1,3. Accordingly, we sequenced small RNAs co-immunoprecipitated by an antibody 
specific to the four AGOs from human 293T cells infected with PR8/delNS1 (Fig. 1a, left), 
an NS1-deletion mutant of IAV strain A/Puerto Rico/8/1934(H1N1) characterized 
previously27.
We found that 93.6% of the 41,324 virus reads, cloned by a protocol requiring the presence 
of monophosphates at the 5′ termini, were in the 21 to 23 nt size range of Dicer products, 
with 22 nt as the most dominant size for both positive and negative strands (Fig. 1a, left; 
Supplementary Table 1). The 22 nt RNAs of IAV exhibited a strong preference for uracil as 
the 5′-terminal nucleotide (1U) (71.5%, or 62.9% for 21–23 nt vsiRNAs, Supplementary 
Table 1) and were highly enriched for 20 nt perfect base-paired duplexes with 2 nt 3′ 
overhangs (Fig. 1a, left). The influenza vsiRNAs were abundant, representing 0.34% of the 
total sequenced reads and equal to 0.81% of the total mature miRNA content in the library

 (Supplementary Table 1). Moreover, 91.8% of the virus reads were derived from the terminal 
100 nt regions of the eight virion RNA segments (Fig. 1c, Supplementary Table 1 and 
Supplementary Fig. 1), and these terminal virus reads formed successive (or phased) 
complementary pairs of vsiRNAs (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Fig. 2). These results suggest 
that the terminal viral dsRNA replicative intermediates served as the predominant precursors 
of the influenza vsiRNAs, similar to those terminal vsiRNAs produced by mouse embryonic 
stem cells to target encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV)11. Approximately 65% of the 
vsiRNA reads were mapped to the shortest genome segment NS, which is 418 nt in length 
after the deletion of the NS1 gene. In particular, we measured 20,048 reads for the second 
pair of 22 nt vsiRNAs from the 3′ terminus, a number similar to those detected for 
microRNA 221-3p (20,206), the 22nd most abundant miRNA in the AGO co-IP library. 
Nevertheless, the total reads mapped to the remaining seven genome segments also exhibited 
the canonical properties of vsiRNAs (Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Figs 3 and 
4).
We also sequenced an independent library of small RNAs co-immunoprecipitated with 
AGOs from 293T cells infected with WSN/delNS1, a NS1-deletion mutant of the human 
IAV A/WSN/1933(H1N1). Our analysis revealed a highly similar population of vsiRNAs co-
immunoprecipitated with AGOs from WSN/delNS1-infected human cells (Fig. 1b, left; 
Supplementary Figs 1b,2b,3,4b and Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). Therefore, the influenza 
vsiRNAs from two independent libraries closely resemble previously described vsiRNAs 
generated in mice10,11 and differ drastically from the virus-derived small RNAs detected 
previously during wild-type IAV infection, which are almost exclusively from negative 
strands with a random size distribution and 5′ co-terminal with virion RNAs14,15.
The 22 nt vsiRNAs were more abundant than other sizes, and were highly enriched for 
canonical pairs of vsiRNAs in the libraries of total small RNAs constructed without AGO 
co-immunoprecipitated from two different sources of 293T cells infected with either PR8/
delNS1 or WSN/delNS1 (Fig. 1a,b and Supplementary Figs 3,4c–f,4h). However, there were 
also abundant positive- and negative-strand virus reads outside the size range of Dicer 
products and the peak at 22 nt was weaker in these libraries than in those sequenced after 
AGO co-IP. These findings together indicate that combining VSR deletion and AGO co-IP 
improves the detection of human vsiRNAs.
The influenza vsiRNAs of either polarity were readily detectable as discrete bands in the 21 
to 22 nt size range by northern blotting from 293T cells infected with PR8/delNS1 (Fig. 2a), 
providing an independent verification of the production and size of the sequenced influenza 
vsiRNAs. We found that the influenza vsiRNAs became undetectable in a characterized 
human 293T cell line28 deficient in human Dicer (hDicer-knockout (KO), Figs 2a,c). 
Importantly, production of the influenza vsiRNAs was rescued by ectopic expression of 
wild-type hDicer (Figs 2b,c and Supplementary Fig. 5). Together, our findings show that 
wild-type hDicer mediates the production of the influenza vsiRNAs, revealing a new activity 
of hDicer to process virus-specific dsRNA precursors into siRNAs in mature somatic cells, 
in addition to its role in cellular miRNA biogenesis29.

 hDicer shares the same domain architecture with Drosophila Dicer-2 (dDicer2), which is 
known to process viral dsRNA into predominantly 21 nt vsiRNAs in fruit fly somatic 
tissues29–32. We found that expression of dDicer2 rescued production of influenza vsiRNAs 
in hDicer-KO cells (Supplementary Fig. 5). This was further enhanced by co-expression 
with its dsRNA-binding protein partners29 to levels detectable by northern blot hybridization 
(Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig. 5), consistent with the recent characterization of dDicer2 
expressed in wild-type human 293 cells33. In contrast, the influenza vsiRNAs remained 
undetectable in the hDicer-KO cells co-expressing dDicer1 with its partner (Fig. 2b), which 
produces miRNAs in Drosophila29,32. Notably, a dominant size shift of the influenza 
vsiRNAs to 21 nt was detected by deep sequencing in the hDicer-KO cells ectopically 
expressing dDicer2 when compared to the 22 nt vsiRNAs in the cells ectopically expressing 
hDicer (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. 5). By comparison, the 1U preference was less 
pronounced for the dDicer2-dependent vsiRNAs than for those made by hDicer 
(Supplementary Fig. 5). However, the distribution pattern of hotspot vsiRNAs over the viral 
genomic RNAs was highly similar for the 21 and 22 nt vsiRNAs made by dDicer2 and 
hDicer (Supplementary Figs 6 and 7), respectively, suggesting that a similar set of dsRNA 
precursors were recognized and processed by the two Dicer nucleases. These findings 
further illustrate the accessibility of the influenza vsiRNA precursors to Dicer in human 
somatic cells.
We found that the production of influenza vsiRNAs was also efficiently induced in both 
human lung epithelial A549 cells and African green monkey epithelial Vero cells by 
infection with PR8/delNS1 (Fig. 3a). The canonical properties of the influenza vsiRNAs 
were more clearly visible from the total small RNAs sequenced directly from PR8/delNS1-
infected A549 cells without AGO co-IP (Fig. 3b) than in those sequenced without AGO co-
IP from 293T cells (Fig. 1a,b and Supplementary Figs 3 and 4). Our results together 
illustrate that the production of abundant vsiRNAs is a conserved immune response to IAV 
infection in distinct human and monkey somatic cells that do not encode the rodent-specific 
Dicer isoform expressed only in oocytes34. A mutational analysis indicated that although a 
mutant hDicer with an inactive ATPase domain remained active in the production of the 
influenza vsiRNAs, the influenza vsiRNAs became undetectable when mutations were 
introduced to disrupt the PAZ, RNase IIIa or RNase IIIb domain of hDicer (Fig. 3c).
The influenza vsiRNAs were not detected by northern blot analysis in 293T, A549 and Vero 
cells infected with wild-type PR8 (Figs 2a and 3a), suggesting suppression of the biogenesis 
of the cognate vsiRNAs by NS1 expressed in cis from the viral genome during IAV 
infection. Moreover, we found that ectopic expression of NS1 of either PR8 or WSN 
actively inhibited the production of the influenza vsiRNAs induced by PR8/delNS1 infection 
(Fig. 3d). These findings define a new activity of NS1 in inhibiting the production of its 
cognate vsiRNAs induced by an authentic virus infection of human somatic cells, and 
explains why canonical vsiRNAs are largely undetectable during wild-type IAV 
infection14,15,25. Next, we investigated if this assay could be used to identify VSRs capable 
of suppressing the biogenesis of human vsiRNAs. We observed strong suppression of the 
influenza vsiRNA biogenesis by virion protein 35 (VP35) of the Ebola virus (Fig. 3d), 
shown previously to exhibit VSR activity10,35. Production of the influenza vsiRNAs was 
also suppressed by VP35 encoded by the Marburg virus from the same Filoviridae as Ebola

 virus, but not by the distantly related VP35 encoded by the bat genome (Fig. 3d). These 
findings show that human viruses have evolved VSRs to inhibit Dicer activity towards viral 
RNA substrates.
We next determined whether antiviral RNAi restricted IAV infection in mature mammalian 
cells capable of also eliciting a type I IFN antiviral response. To avoid the pleiotropic effects 
of the loss of cellular miRNAs on virus infection in Dicer knockout cells28,36, we examined 
IAV infection in RNAi-defective primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) carrying a 
genetic mutation abolishing the activity of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) to 
slice target RNA guided by siRNAs. The Argonaute (AGO) proteins4–7 are essential core 
components of antiviral RNAi in fungi, plants, insects and nematodes, and are highly 
conserved in eukaryotes29. Mammals possess four AGOs (AGO 1–4, also known as Eif2c1–
4), only one of which, AGO2, exhibits cleavage activity towards target RNA in experimental 
RNAi37. Furthermore, the catalytic triad in the PIWI domain of AGO2 is deeply conserved, 
despite the fact that animal miRNAs modulate their targets without AGO-mediated cleavage, 
suggestive of a function in mammals beyond the processing of a single Dicer-independent 
miRNA38. Human AGO2 is necessary and sufficient to mediate antiviral RNAi against 
Nodamura virus infection in mouse embryonic stem cells11, but it is unknown whether this 
function involves the slicer activity of AGO2, or whether AGO2 is antiviral in differentiated 
mammalian cells with an intact interferon (IFN) system17,38. We verified efficient loading of 
the influenza vsiRNAs onto human AGO2 during infection of 293T cells (Supplementary 
Fig. 8). We took the approach of directly examining the contribution of AGO2 catalytic 
activity to mammalian antiviral defence in mature, IFN-producing cells. Similar mutational 
analyses have certainly demonstrated an essential role for the slicer activity of both 
Drosophila and Arabidopsis AGO2 in antiviral RNAi against wild-type RNA virus infection 
in plants and fruit flies8,9. We infected two independent primary MEF lines38 where AGO2 
is expressed but is catalytically inactive due to substitution of the first aspartic acid in the 
DDH triad with an alanine (Ago2D597A)38. Importantly, unlike cells deficient in AGO2 
protein39, which exhibit a marked loss of host miRNAs, virtually all miRNAs are present in 
these Ago2D597A cells38. We observed a significant increase in virus levels in cells carrying 
one allele (Ago2D597A/+), and a further increase in cells carrying two alleles of catalytic-
inactive AGO2 (Ago2D597A/D597A) compared to wild-type cells following infection with 
wild-type PR8 IAV, as measured by plaque assay of cell supernatants and qPCR for virus 
RNA (Fig. 4a–c). Increased IAV-induced cytopathy was also observed in Ago2D597A MEFs, 
as demonstrated both by light microscopy images and an increased percentage of Annexin V 
and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, dihydrochloride (DAPI)-positive cells following 
infection (Supplementary Fig. 9). Hence, AGO2 catalytic activity restricts wild-type IAV in 
mature, IFN-capable mammalian cells. However, the levels of type I IFN and induction of 
IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) were similar in wild-type and Ago2D597A MEFs following IAV 
infection (Fig. 4d) or following infection or stimulation with multiple viruses or viral ligands 
(Supplementary Fig. 9). Moreover, the expression levels of RNAi components Drosha, Dicer 
and Ago1–4 (Fig. 4d), growth rate and entry of IAV were equal in wild-type and Ago2D597A 
MEFs (Supplementary Fig 9). Thus, the slicing activity of AGO2 suppresses IAV infection 
by RNAi, but not by altering the known IFN-dependent antiviral responses or affecting entry 
of IAV.

 We next tested the ability of AGO2 catalytic activity to suppress PR8/delNS1 lacking the 
multifunctional protein NS1. Infection of Ago2D597A MEFs with PR8/delNS1 resulted in 
significantly enhanced virus levels, as measured by qPCR for haemagglutinin (HA) (Fig. 
4c). The enhancement was also significantly more than that observed for wild-type influenza 
with intact NS1 in Ago2D597A MEFs (Fig. 4c), demonstrating some genetic rescue of PR8/
delNS1 in AGO2 catalytic inactive cells. To assess whether AGO2 catalytic activity is a 
broad antiviral mechanism for a range of virus types, we infected wild-type and Ago2D597A 
MEFs with the positive-strand RNA virus EMCV or the negative-strand RNA virus vesicular 
stomatitis virus (VSV). We observed a significant increase in the levels of both viruses in 
cells carrying one (Ago2D597A/+) or two (Ago2D597A/D597A) alleles compared to wild-type 
cells following infection, as measured by plaque assay of cell supernatants, qPCR for virus 
RNA or immunoblots for virus protein (Fig. 4e–i). Hence, AGO2 catalytic activity restricts 
multiple virus infections in mature mammalian cells. Importantly, we also observed an 
increase in virus levels following infection of AGO2 catalytic dead MEFs in the absence of 
type I IFN signalling (Fig. 4j–m), indicating an IFN-independent antiviral function of Ago2 
catalytic activity.
Here, we have demonstrated a specific VSR activity of NS1 to inhibit the processing of the 
cognate viral dsRNA molecules into siRNAs during authentic infection of distinct 
mammalian cell lines, in addition to the known antagonizing activities of NS1 against IFN-
regulated antiviral responses. In the absence of NS1 suppression, we found that wild-type 
human Dicer mediates the production of highly abundant vsiRNAs in response to IAV 
infection, revealing innate immune detection of human RNA virus infection for the first time 
in mature human somatic cells by the RNAi pathway. Our findings illustrate the importance 
of using VSR-deficient mutant viruses to probe antiviral RNAi and provide the first 
experimental system to characterize the Dicer-mediated biogenesis of siRNAs from naturally 
occurring precursors in mammalian cells. It also explains why previous attempts failed to 
detect significant levels of canonical vsiRNAs in wild-type mammalian cells challenged by 
wild-type viruses. Our observation that the influenza viral siRNA biogenesis is potently 
suppressed by VP35 suggests a strategy to characterize the production of Ebola and Marburg 
viral siRNAs in mammalian cells using mutant viruses expressing VP35 variants defective in 
RNAi suppression. Moreover, it is likely that the influenza vsiRNAs produced by human 
Dicer are biologically active, because they exhibit a strong 1U preference and are loaded in 
AGOs in abundances similar to cellular miRNAs. Consistently, we show that antiviral 
defence against IAV infection in mature mammalian cells specifically requires the slicing 
activity of AGO2, known to be essential for RNAi directed by synthetic siRNAs. Notably, 
antiviral RNAi mediated by the slicing activity of AGO2 functions without altering known 
IFN-dependent antiviral responses, is effective against both EMCV and VSV, and remains 
functional in the absence of type I IFN signalling. Although further in vivo characterization 
is necessary, these findings suggest that antiviral RNAi in cultured mammalian cells can 
function in an IFN-independent manner. The results presented in this study and in recent 
publications10,11 together show that infection with distinct families of RNA viruses triggers 
the production of highly abundant vsiRNAs in mammalian cells. In turn, mammalian RNA 
viruses have evolved to suppress biogenesis of their cognate vsiRNAs during infection, 
consistent with a proposed role for VSR activity in human cell infection. We propose that

 the RNAi pathway has the capacity to confer widespread antiviral function in mammals 
against RNA viruses.
Methods
Cell culture
Human lung epithelial cells (A549) were maintained in F-12K medium, and human 
embryonic kidney cells (293T) and African green monkey kidney epithelial cells (Vero) 
were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal 
bovine serum. hDicer knockout 293T cell line 4–25 and its parental 293T cell line28 were 
gifts from B. Cullen. Two separate lines38 of MEFs from Ago2 catalytic inactive mice, 
where the endogenous Ago2 allele was replaced with one carrying an ADH rather than a 
DDH triad (Ago2D597A), were provided by S. Cheloufi (Massachusetts General Hospital) 
and G. Hannon (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories). MEFs were cultured in DMEM with 
15% FBS, L-glutamine, penicillin-streptomycin and β-mercaptoethanol. All cell lines were 
authenticated and tested for mycoplasma contamination.
Virus infections
Influenza A/WSN/1/33 (H1N1) and A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) viruses, designated PR8-
wild type (WT) and WSN-WT, respectively, and their NS1 deletion mutants, designated 
PR8/delNS1 and WSN/delNS1, as well as PR8-NS1/RFP, were gifts from A. Garcıa-Sastre 
and P. Palese27,40. EMCV was purchased from ATCC. VSV (Indiana strain) was provided by 
C. Rice and M. MacDonald. MEFs were infected in 12-well plates with 100 μl virus for 
indicated multiplicities of infection (MOIs) diluted in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) 
supplemented with 1% FBS, calcium and magnesium for 1 h at 37 °C, with rocking every 15 
min. Virus was removed, cells were washed once with PBS, and this was replaced with 
appropriate medium. This was considered time 0. To determine influenza titres in cell 
supernatants, plaque assays were performed on canine kidney (MDCK) cells using 0.6% 
BSA, 2% oxoid agarose, 1 mg ml−1 Trypsin-TPCK, 0.6% NaHCO3, 2% sodium pyruvate, 
1% penicillin/streptomycin, 50 mM HEPES, 4 mM L-glutamine in 2× DMEM for plaque 
formation and plaques counted 2–3 days post-infection (d.p.i.). For quantification of EMCV 
titres, plaque assays were performed on Vero cells with 1.5% low electroendosmosis (LE) 
agarose and plaques were counted at 24 h.p.i. For quantification of VSV titres, plaque assays 
were performed on baby hamster kidney (BHK-21) cells with 1.5% LE agarose and plaques 
were counted at 16 h.p.i., when cells were fixed with 7% formaldehyde followed by crystal 
violet staining. To assess viral entry, cells were infected with A/Puerto Rico/8/34 at MOI = 
50 for 2 h in the presence of 30 μg ml−1 of cylcoheximide. Following infection, cells were 
incubated in 0.025% Trypsin-EDTA at room temperature for 7 min, to remove any virus that 
had adsorbed to the cell surface but had not yet been internalized, as previously described41. 
Incorporated virus was assayed by qPCR. Cell death following virus infection was 
determined by flow cytometric analysis of Annexin V and DAPI-positive cells. Data analysis 
was performed with FlowJo (TreeStar).

 Plasmids and molecular cloning
The coding sequences for the NS1 of PR8-WT and WSN-WT (ref. 2) were obtained by 
reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from infected cells and cloned 
into pcDNA3.1 vector to generate pcDNA-PR8-NS1 and pcDNA-WSN-NS1. The 
expression plasmids in pCAGGS for the VP35 of Ebola virus (EBOV), Marburg virus 
(MARV) and bat with an N-terminal Flag tag42 were gifts from C.F. Basler. The expression 
plasmids for human AGO2, Dicer and Dicer mutants were purchased from Addgene (cat. 
nos. 10822, 19873, 41584, 41585, 41586, 41587, 41588, 41589 and 41590). The cDNA 
clones for Drosophila Loquacious isoforms PB and PD (Loqs-PB and Loqs PD) were from 
Addgene (nos. 41094 and 42095) whereas the plasmids encoding Drosophila proteins 
dDicer-1, dDicer-2 and R2D2 were gifts from Q. Liu43,44. The open reading frames (ORFs) 
of Loqs-PB, Loqs PD and R2D2 were cloned with an N-terminal Flag tag into pcDNAFlag45 
to generate pcDNA-Flag-PB, pcDNA-Flag-PD and pcDNA-Flag-R2D2, respectively. The 
ORFs of dDicer-1 and dDicer-2 were cloned with an N-terminal His tag into 
pcDNA4HisMax45 to generate pcDNA-His-dDcr1 and pcDNA-His-dDcr2, respectively.
Cell culture infection, transfection and the construction of small RNA libraries
293T and hDcrKO 293T cells were seeded in a 6 cm plate at a density of 2.5 × 106 per plate 
one day before infection. At 24 h after inoculation with serum-free DMEM (mock), PR8-
WT, WSN-WT, PR8/delNS1 or WSN/delNS1 (MOI = 1) as previously described45, infected 
cells were collected for the extraction of total protein and RNA using TRIzol (Invitrogen) 
according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
To determine the role of Dicer in the biogenesis of viral siRNAs (vsiRNAs), hDicer-KO 
293T cells seeded in a 6 cm plate at a density of 2.5 × 106 per plate were transfected with 8 
μg of the plasmid encoding hDicer or a hDicer mutant carrying the following amino acid 
mutation(s) in key residues (as described in ref. 36): K70A, Y971A/Y972A, D1320A, 
E1564A, D1709A, D1320A/D1709A or Drosophila Dicer-2 (dDcr2). Alternatively they 
were co-transfected with (1) 8 μg pcDNA-His-dDcr1 and 4 μg pcDNA-Flag-PB, (2) 8 μg 
pcDNA-His-dDcr2 and 4 μg pcDNA-Flag-Loqs-PD or (3) 8 μg pcDNA-His-dDcr2, 4 μg 
pcDNA-Flag-Loqs-PD and 4 μg pcDNA-Flag-R2D2 using TransIT-LT1 transfection reagent 
(Mirus) following the supplier’s recommended protocol. Six hours after transfection, hDcr-
KO 293T cells were infected by PR8/delNS1 (MOI = 1) and the infected cells were 
collected for the extraction of total protein and RNA using TRIzol 24 h after infection.
To determine the activity of viral suppressors of RNAi (VSRs), hDcr-KO 293T cells seeded 
in a six-well plate at a density of 1.3 × 106 per well were co-transfected with 4 μg of the 
hDicer expression plasmid with one (2 μg) of the following VSR-expressing plasmids: 
pcDNA-PR8-NS1, pcDNA-WSN-NS1, pCAGGS-EBOV-VP35, pCAGGS-MARV-VP35 or 
pCAGGS-bat-VP35. At 6 h after co-transfection, the hDcr-KO 293T cells were infected by 
PR8/delNS1 (MOI = 1), and the infected cells were collected for the extraction of total 
protein and RNA using TRIzol 24 h after infection.
Libraries of small RNAs were constructed from total RNA extracted 24 h after infection of 
293T cells with PR8/delNS1 or WSN/delNS1 either without or with co-IP by Anti-pan Ago

 antibody (Millipore), by a method depending on the 5′ monophosphate of small RNAs 
(described previously10), with a TruSeq Small RNA Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina). 
Libraries of small RNAs were also constructed from (1) total RNA from A549 cells 24 h 
after infection with PR8/delNS1, (2) total RNA from PR8/delNS1-infected hDcr-KO 293T 
cells without or with ectopic expression of hDicer, dDicer-2 or dDicer-2 plus Loqs-PD and 
R2D2, and (3) total RNA co-immunoprecipitated from 293T cells over-expressing FLAG-
tagged human AGO2 24 h after infection with PR8/delNS1.
Western and northern blot analyses
Western blot analysis was performed as described previously45. Antibodies to NS1, NP and 
His tag antibodies were gifts of Y. Zhou45. Antibodies to NoV B2 have been described 
previously10. Antibodies to hDicer (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), β-actin (Cell Signaling 
Technology) and Flag M2 (Sigma-Aldrich) were sourced from commercial suppliers. For 
northern blot analysis of low-molecular-weight RNAs, 15 μg total RNA extracted from cells 
24 h after infection and a chemical crosslinking protocol46 were used, essentially as 
described previously, but with one modification10: instead of using locked nucleic acid 
(LNA) oligonucleotides as probes10, the negative- and positive-strand influenza viral RNAs 
were detected by the 32P-labelled synthetic RNA oligo, 5′-CAUAAUGG 
AUCCAAACACUGUG-3′ and 5′-GACACAGUGUUUGGAUCCAUUA-3′, respectively. 
Each experiment presented in Fig. 2 was repeated twice, with reproducible results.
Deep sequencing and bioinformatic analysis of small RNAs
Libraries of small RNAs cloned from cultured human cells were sequenced by an Illumina 
HiSeq 2000/2500 at the Core Facility of the Institute for Integrative Genome Biology on 
campus. Small RNA reads were mapped to the virus and host genome references or 
compared to mature miRNAs. Mapping was done by Bowtie 1.0.0 with either a perfect 
match or one mismatch only in Supplementary Fig. 5a. All of the references used were 
downloaded from web sources as listed below. Subsequent bioinformatics analysis of virus-
derived small RNAs was carried out using in-house Perl scripts as described previously10. 
Pairs of complementary 22 nt vsiRNAs in each library with different base-pairing lengths 
were computed using a previously described algorithm10, which calculates the total counts 
of pairs in each nucleotide distance between the 5′ and 3′ ends of complementary 22 nt 
vsiRNAs. The following reference sequences were used in this study:
•
PR8/delNS1: Obtained from A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) (PR8-WT) by deleting 
nucleotides 57 to 528 in the NS segment. The sequence of PR8-WT was 
downloaded from NCBI: AF389115.1, AF389116.1, AF389117.1, AF389118.1, 
AF389119.1, AF389120.1, AF389121.1 and AF389122.1.
•
WSN/delNS1: Obtained from A/WSN/1/33 (H1N1) (WSN-WT) by deleting 
nucleotides 57 to 528 in the NS segment. The sequence of PR8-WT was 
downloaded from NCBI: J02179.1, J02178.1, CY034137.1, J02176.1, 
CY034135.1, L25817.1, L25818.1 and M12597.1, with the missing terminal 
sequences from the following segments completed by sequencing (underlined 
nucleotides are the original terminals from NCBI):

Correlation analysis of small RNA populations
The correlation analysis of small RNA populations was carried out using the following 
formulae:
n indicates the total number of nucleotide positions on each strand of the PR8-delNS1 
genome in the analysis for correlation between 21 and 22 nt influenza vsiRNAs made 
by hDicer and dDicer2.
i indicates a specific nucleotide position, as referred to above, that is covered or not 
covered by either 22 or 21 nt vsiRNAs from the hDicer and dDicer2 libraries, 
respectively.
yi indicates the relative coverage at position i by 22 nt vsiRNAs made by hDicer with 
a value between 0 and 1 after normalization by the maximum 22 nt vsiRNA coverage 
of each virion RNA segment in either polarity. ȳ indicates the average coverage by 
22 nt vsiRNAs at all nucleotide positions n.
xi indicates the relative coverage at position i by 21 nt vsiRNAs made by dDicer2 
with a value between 0 and 1 after normalization by the maximum 21 nt vsiRNA 
coverage of each virion RNA segment in either polarity. x̄ indicates the average 
coverage by 21 nt vsiRNAs at all nucleotide positions n.

 Any given nucleotide position (i) with a value change (yi − xi) beyond the interval [μ − 3σ, μ 
+ 3σ] was considered to display significant variation between the two small RNA libraries. 
Otherwise it was considered to display no significant variation.
Other reagents and cell stimulations
LPS (Escherichia coli 0111:B4, used at 100 ng ml−1) and polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid 
(PolyI:C, used at 10 μg ml−1) were purchased from Sigma. 5′ Triphosphate double-stranded 
RNA (5′ ppp-dsRNA) was purchased from InvivoGen. Monoclonal antibody to Interferon A 
Receptor (anti-IFNAR, MAR103, used at 10 μg ml−1) was purchased from eBiosciences. 
Sendai virus was purchased from ATCC.
RNA isolation, reverse transcription and qPCR
RNA was isolated with the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). RNA was reverse transcribed using 
Reverse Transcription Supermix (Biorad). qPCR was performed using SYBR green 
(BioRad), and PCR products were quantified with a standard curve. Gene expression was 
displayed relative to the housekeeping gene, TATA box protein Tbp. The following primer 
sequences were used: Flu HA: forward CTGCTCGAAGACAGCCACAA, reverse 
GAGCCACCGGCGATCTTAC; Flu NP forward ACGGCTGGTCTGACTCACAT, reverse 
TCCATTCCGGTGCGAACAAG; Ifnb1 forward CTGCGTTCCTGCTGTG CTTCTCCA, 
reverse TTCTCCGTCATCTCCATAGGGATC Isg15: forward 
TGAGAGCAAGCAGCCAGAAG, reverse ACGGACACCAGGAAATCGTT, Tbp forward 
TGATCAAACCCAGAATTGTTCT, reverse TGGTCTTCCTGAAT CCCTTTA. A custom-
ordered PrimePCR Mouse Assay panel (BioRad) containing Ifn pathway genes and RNAi 
machinery components were also used.
Statistical analysis
GraphPad Prism was used for all statistical analysis. All experiments were repeated at least 
three times. Statistical analysis was carried out by two-way or one-way analysis of variance 
(ANOVA), or by an unpaired t-test of biological replicates. A P value of <0.05 was 
considered statistically significant.
