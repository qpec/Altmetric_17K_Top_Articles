Abstract
Descriptive observational studies showed upward jumps in secular European perinatal mortality trends after Chernobyl. The question
arises whether the Fukushima nuclear power plant accident entailed similar phenomena in Japan. For 47 prefectures representing
15.2 million births from 2001 to 2014, the Japanese government provides monthly statistics on 69,171 cases of perinatal death of the
fetus or the newborn after 22 weeks of pregnancy to 7 days after birth. Employing change-point methodology for detecting
alterations in longitudinal data, we analyzed time trends in perinatal mortality in the Japanese prefectures stratified by exposure to
estimate and test potential increases in perinatal death proportions after Fukushima possibly associated with the earthquake, the
tsunami, or the estimated radiation exposure. Areas with moderate to high levels of radiation were compared with less exposed and
unaffected areas, as were highly contaminated areas hit versus untroubled by the earthquake and the tsunami. Ten months after the
earthquake and tsunami and the subsequent nuclear accident, perinatal mortality in 6 severely contaminated prefectures jumped up
from January 2012 onward: jump odds ratio 1.156; 95% confidence interval (1.061, 1.259), P-value 0.0009. There were slight
increases in areas with moderate levels of contamination and no increases in the rest of Japan. In severely contaminated areas, the
increases of perinatal mortality 10 months after Fukushima were essentially independent of the numbers of dead and missing due to
the earthquake and the tsunami. Perinatal mortality in areas contaminated with radioactive substances started to increase 10 months
after the nuclear accident relative to the prevailing and stable secular downward trend. These results are consistent with findings in
Europe after Chernobyl. Since observational studies as the one presented here may suggest but cannot prove causality because of
unknown and uncontrolled factors or confounders, intensified research in various scientific disciplines is urgently needed to better
qualify and quantify the association of natural and artificial environmental radiation with detrimental genetic health effects at the
population level.

1. Introduction
After the Great East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami on March
11, 2011, the destroyed Tokyo Electric Power Company
(TEPCO)
Fukushima
No.1
nuclear
power
plant
released
radioactive elements with an estimated total activity of 900
PBq (Peta-Becquerel) into the atmosphere.[1] The World Health
Organization estimates that the rates of all solid cancers in male
and female infants who were exposed to radiation at the age of
one in Namie-Machi in the Fukushima prefecture, a highly
contaminated area, would increase by 14% and 24% in 15 years,
and that the rates of leukemia would increase by 83% and 57%,
respectively.[2]
Moreover,
the
World
Health
Organization
estimates that the rates of thyroid cancer among those males
and females would increase 7.4 and 9 times, respectively, and
suggests increases in breast cancer as well.[2]
Disorders that may occur in irradiated fetuses include cancer and
principalradiationinjuries.[3]Duetothevulnerabilityoftheembryo
and the fetus, concerns have been raised that even the low dose
energy transfer to developing tissue by the frequency magnetic field
exposure during ultrasound examinations might entail some health
risk.[4] As early as in 1958, UNSCEAR acknowledged that an
increase in the frequency of radiation induced dominant mutations
associated with visible effects would manifest itself to some
unknown extent as an increase in the frequency of malformations
and stillbirths.[5] In 10% of the miscarriages, a genetic defect may
cause a baby to be stillborn or to die shortly after birth (perinatal

humans[5,6] may, therefore, be observed in several ways: increase
in frequencies of miscarriages, perinatal mortality, stillbirths,
reduction in fertility, sterility, and disturbance in the ratio of the
sexes at birth. A variety of such detrimental reproductive effects,
including early childhood cancers, after occupational, diagnostic,
therapeutic, and environmental exposures, have been investigated
and reported in the scientific literature:
� Atomic bombing of Japan[7–9]
� Windscale/Sellafield nuclear processing plant fire[10,11]
� Occupational exposure[12–16]
� Diagnostic and therapeutic exposure[17–20]
� Chernobyl nuclear power plant accident[21–33]
� Fukushima nuclear power plant accident[34,35]
� Background radiation[36–38]
� Living near nuclear facilities[9,39–42]
Tsuda et al[43] reported that there was an increase in thyroid
cancer morbidity after the Fukushima No.1 nuclear power plant
accident, which suggests an influence of radiation exposure.
However, the findings by Tsuda et al have been criticized for
presumably being artifacts of a screening effect.[44] Following the
nuclear accident in Fukushima and based on data from 2002 to
2013, increases in the numbers of spontaneous fetal deaths,[34] as
well as an increase in the number of infant deaths[35] were
reported. However, to date there are no reports of increased PDs
in Japan, even though they have been reported in the case of the
Chernobyl nuclear accident.[23,27]
Based on more comprehensive and more recent data from 2001
to 2014, we aim to examine whether or not there were increases
in perinatal mortality in areas contaminated with radioactive
substances in Fukushima prefecture following the nuclear
accident. The Fukushima accident differs from the one at
Chernobyl since people in Japan were additionally affected by the
earthquake and the tsunami. Therefore, we also examine whether
there are associations between the earthquake, the tsunami,
radiation, and perinatal mortality overall and in moderately and
highly contaminated prefectures.
2. Methods
The Japanese Statistics Bureau publishes demographic statistics
including the monthly numbers of live births and PDs created by
the Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare. Six prefectures –
Iwate, Miyagi, Fukushima, Ibaraki, Tochigi, and Gunma – were
classed as severely contaminated; they include wide areas in
which the radiation dose in the air was higher than 0.25mSv/h
(micro-Sieverts per hour), according to a map documenting
estimated radiation doses as of December 2011.[45] Chiba,
Tokyo, and Saitama prefectures were designated as moderately
contaminated areas that involve only few areas where the
radiation dose in the air was higher than 0.25mSv/h. The rest of
Japan (38 prefectures) excluding severely and moderately
contaminated areas was considered not or only slightly affected.

 according to the estimated radiation exposure. Table 1 lists the live
births and the PD cases stratified by year and prefecture group
according to the defined contamination levels. Note, the smaller
moderately exposed area represents approximately twice the
population of the much larger highly contaminated area.
To examine the potential influences of the earthquake and the
tsunami as well as the possible effects of radiation contamination,
the 6 prefectures designated as severely contaminated were
divided into group 1: Iwate (the number of deaths and missing
due to the tsunami as of March 11, 2016: n=5797) and Miyagi
(n=10,777), in which the numbers of the dead and missing were
high; and group 2: Fukushima (n=1810), Ibaraki (n=25),
Tochigi (n=4), and Gunma (n=1), in which the numbers of the
dead and the missing were more than 20 times lower compared
to the areas heavily hit, see Table 2.[46] Monthly perinatal
mortalities for those 2 groups were calculated based on the
available monthly numbers of births and PDs to analyze a
possible association between tsunami intensity and PD.
Temporality and biologic gradient are 2 indispensable
requisites for inferring causality. Temporality means that the
presumable cause precedes the observed effect in time, and
biologic gradient refers to the presence of an exposure–response
association.[47,48] Consequently, we investigate whether there
are changes in perinatal mortality trends after Fukushima and
whether those changes, if any, are associated with the level of
contamination. To this end, we applied linear logistic regression
allowing for jumps at certain time lags (in months) after the
tsunami to model perinatal mortality trends and to test for
trend changes possibly associated with contamination. We
denote the number of PDs by n, the number of total birth by
N, and the estimated PD proportion as p=n/N. Two central
parameters in this context are the odds O=n/(N�n), and the
odds ratio OR=O1/O0=n1/(N1�n1)/(n0/(N0�n0)), which is
the ratio of the odds for 2 populations with O1 and O0 to be
compared, for example, in exposed versus nonexposed strata.
The dummy variable for the time window from T onward, for
example, T=January 2012, is defined as dT (t)=0 for t<T and
dT (t)=1 for t≥T. The distributional assumption and the
parsimonious logistic jump model for a trend in t and a jump
in T are:
nteBinomial ðNt; ptÞ; log oddsðptÞ
¼ intercept þ a �t þ b�dTðtÞ
ð1Þ
In formula (1), t denotes time (year and month), nt the number
of PD in t, Nt the number of total births in t, and pt is the
probability of PD in t. If time t is significant in a certain setting it
may be considered a confounder as it is associated with the
outcome variable “perinatal death” as well as with the exposure
classed
“before
versus
after
Fukushima.”

 assumption of a binomial distribution implies that the variances
of the random variables are determined by the binomial
parameter p. In practice, the estimated sample variances are
smaller or larger than theory predicts (heterogeneity) for
randomness or for unknown reasons, for example, unspecified
or unknown covariables. Underdispersion may be due to
correlated variables, over-fitting, or over-adjustment. Over-
dispersion may be a consequence of relevant variables missing
in the corresponding model. Therefore, statistical models can be
generalized by introducing a heterogeneity parameter, and, to be
conservative in this respect, we will allow for this extension in the
case of overdispersion but never in the case of underdisper-
sion.[48] For example, the data and models in Figs. 3–5 involve
only minor heterogeneity: deviance/(degree of freedom) 0.951,
1.124, and 0.998, respectively. In Statistical Analysis System,
software produced by SAS Institute Inc. (SAS), for example,
correction for oversdispersion may be invoked by the option
“ . . . /scale=d” in the model statement of the “procedure
logistic.” The basic model in formula (1) will be complemented
by further variables, for example, confounders, including
appropriate interactions to estimate or to account for the effects
of interesting periods or seasonality, that is, the month-to-month
variation, or the immediate or possible late effects of the tsunami.
For the Japanese monthly PD trend functions, a change-point
(CP) analysis[49,50] based on logistic regression and the minimum
deviance criterion (goodness of fit) is carried out. The deviance
for a logistic model is defined in equation (2).
deviance ¼ 2�Sobserved�logðobserved=expectedÞ

The purpose of the CP method is to estimate an optimum point
in time, if any exists, when the occurrence of PDs after Fukushima
changes its trend. The data in this study were processed with

3. Results
For
the
monthly
PD
trend
function
in
the
6
severely
contaminated prefectures, a CP analysis based on logistic
regression and the minimum deviance criterion (goodness of fit)
is carried out in Fig. 2.[49,50] The deviance (2) of a model of type
(1) with parallel trends and a possible downward or upward
jump in a given month between January 2008 and December
2014 is plotted against that month in Fig. 2. This CP analysis
discloses a unique and significant upward jump of the perinatal
mortality in January 2012 with minimum deviance among all
other months from the beginning of 2008 to the end of 2014.
For comparison, we included in Fig. 2 the deviance curve for the
3 moderately contaminated prefectures. No single distinct CP
can be identified for those less affected parts of Japan. The
deviance analyses are most informative for approximately
balanced time periods before or after the assumed “event.”
Therefore, the analysis of the period prior to 2008 is of minor
interest in the context of our paper that puts emphasis on the
year 2011 of the Fukushima accident. The CP analysis in Fig. 2
is so to speak a comprehensive sensitivity analysis as it allows
for a wide range of potential jump dates and emphasizes the
optimum one, which is, here, the optimum time lag of 10
months between the effect and the foregoing event, that is, the
Fukushima accident followed by an upward jump in perinatal
mortality.
Figure 3 presents monthly perinatal mortality in the 6 severely
contaminated prefectures: Fukushima, Gunma, Ibaraki, Iwate,
Miyagi, and Tochigi. The annual perinatal mortality proportions
are subject to a rather uniform decrease from 2001 to 2014.
Perinatal mortality proportions decline with an OR per year of
0.960; (0.952, 0.968). However, estimating a jump 10 months
after the Fukushima accident (see Fig. 2) yields the upward
jump OR 1.156; (1.061, 1.259). To concretize this effect, the
jump in the perinatal mortality proportion from January 2012 to
December 2014 may be translated into 165 (66, 278) excess PD
cases. Adjusting the parsimonious basic model (1) for seasonality
by including independent dummy variables for the months
February to December yields practically the same estimates: trend
ORadjusted=0.961;
(0.953,
0.968);
jump
ORadjusted
1.150;
(1.055, 1.253). To estimate the presumable immediate effect of
the earthquake and the tsunami in the 6 contaminated prefectures
in March and April 2011 we include in model (1) the independent

 dummies for February to December and the interaction of those
dummies for March and April (for any year) with the dummy
variable for the year 2011. It appears that the perinatal mortality
in the 6 contaminated prefectures in March and April 2011 is
increased by approximately 20% compared to March and April
of the remaining years: OR 1.202; (0.959, 1.506). This may be
anticipated from Fig. 3 by inspection of the somewhat elevated
perinatal mortality in March 2011.
Figure 4 presents monthly perinatal mortality in the 3
moderately contaminated prefectures: Chiba, Saitama, and
Tokyo. The overall trend is similar to the one in Fig. 3. In
Fig. 4, perinatal mortality proportions decline with an OR per
year of 0.960 (0.954, 0.966). The estimated jump 10 months after
the Fukushima accident yields an OR of 1.068 (1.001, 1.139).
This effect translates into 153 (10, 309) excess PD cases. The
effect estimate is nearly half the value in the highly contaminated
prefectures. Combining the data from Figs. 3 and 4 yields an
overall and more accurate estimate of the presumable total excess
PDs in Japan from January 2012 to December 2014 of 318 cases
with 95%-confidence limits of (136, 519). Interestingly, the
downward trends in perinatal mortality in the contaminated
prefectures continue after Fukushima, however, at somewhat
elevated levels.
The monthly perinatal mortality in the rest of Japan, that is,
Japan excluding the 6 severely and 3 moderately affected
prefectures dealt with above, is shown in Fig. 5. The overall trend
is again similar to the ones in Figs. 3 and 4. In the unaffected
Japan, the perinatal mortality declines with an OR per year of
0.971 (968, 0.974), and in contrast to the 9 contaminated
prefectures, there is no discernible jump 10 months after
Fukushima: OR 0.991 (0.958, 1.024).
Figures 6 and 7 present the perinatal mortality trends in the 6
severely contaminated prefectures stratified by the impact of the
earthquake and the tsunami according to Table 2. In the 4 less
tsunami-impacted prefectures Fukushima, Gunma, Ibaraki, and
Tochigi, the secular downward trend is consistent with the
overall trends in the 6 severely and 3 moderately contaminated
prefectures with an OR of 0.961 (0.952, 0.970). The jump OR
1.175 (1.062, 1.301) in Fig. 6 is also consistent with the one based
on the 6 severely contaminated prefectures in Fig. 3. In Fig. 7,
representing the perinatal mortality in the 2 severely contami-
nated prefectures strongly impacted by the tsunami, we can see a
similar downward trend and jump from January 2012 onward
compared to the situation in Fig. 6. Additionally, in Fig. 7 we
observe an uptick of the perinatal mortality already in March and
April 2011 that can be attributed to the immediate impact of the
earthquake and the tsunami. The OR of this peak in the
seasonally adjusted trend model is 1.479 (1.013, 2.161) and
the jump OR is 1.132 (0.960, 1.3334), which is consistent with
Figure 4. Monthly perinatal mortality in 3 moderately contaminated pre-
fectures Chiba, Saitama, and Tokyo; jump in January 2012, jump odds ratio

 the jumps in January 2012 in Figs. 3 and 6. It is interesting to note
that the perinatal mortality decreased after this uptick in March/
April 2011 and increased again 10 months after those natural and
technical disasters in January 2012. In conclusion, the tsunami
does not confound the association of PD with the presumed
radiation exposure.
4. Discussion
We investigated monthly perinatal mortality in Japan for the
years 2001 to 2014 with emphasis on detrimental pregnancy
outcome possibly caused by the earthquake, the tsunami, or the
subsequent Fukushima nuclear disaster in March 2011. In the 2
severely contaminated prefectures Iwate and Miyagi that were
also heavily hit by the tsunami, there was a more than 50%
increase in perinatal mortality in March and April 2011, and
there was essentially no increase in the remainder of the year
2011. By contrast, looking at the 4 other severely radioactively
affected prefectures (Fukushima, Ibaraki, Tochigi, and Gunma),
which remained nearly untroubled after the natural disasters, we
see essentially no increase in the occurrence of PDs in March and
April 2011, and this applies to the rest of that year as well. In
addition to the short-term effects in March and April 2011 in all
those 6 severely radioactively contaminated prefectures, howev-
er, we observed distinct long-term increases in perinatal mortality
of approximately 15% from January 2012 onward. Further-
more, in the 3 moderately exposed prefectures Chiba, Saitama,
and Tokyo there is a long-term relative 6.8% increase in perinatal
mortality after January 2012, and there is apparently no impact
on perinatal mortality in Japan excluding the severely and
moderately affected prefectures, neither by the earthquake and
the tsunami nor by the Fukushima accident.
Although the present study is of an ecological type based on
highly aggregated data that cannot prove causality in principle, it
nevertheless provides some evidence of causality according to the
well-known Bradford-Hill criteria: temporality and biologic
gradient. The observed effects occur 10 months after the possible
cause (ionizing radiation). This suggests impact primarily on
ovum and sperm and less on the embryo or the fetus. Moreover,
the PD increases show a certain dose–response association with
the presumable exposure: unaffected as well as moderately and
severely impacted prefectures are associated with no, medium,
and maximum effects, respectively. The observed optimum
overall time-lag of 10 months between the radiological event and
the jump in the PD proportion may be explained by the
superposition of the periods necessary for the dispersal of the
radioactivity (several weeks) and the pregnancy length. Note that
the duration of pregnancies at elevated risk of adverse perinatal
outcome may be considerably shorter than the usual 9 months.
Similar
spatiotemporal
associations
between
a
nuclear
accident and subsequent detrimental reproductive effects have
been previously found in Europe after Chernobyl. A time trend
analysis of German perinatal mortality (1980–1993) disclosed a
4.8% increase in 1987, that may be linked to the Chernobyl
accident in 1986.[23] Higher contaminated parts of Germany,
Bavaria and the former German Democratic Republic, showed
perinatal mortality increases of 8.5% and 8.2%, respective-
ly.[27] Significant ecological relative risks in the range of 1.005
to 1.020 per kBq/m2. 137Cs (kilo-Becquerel per square meter
[kBq/m], Cesium [Cs]) for stillbirths and congenital malforma-
tions in Germany and Finland as well as relatively increased
stillbirth proportions across Europe were also seen after
Chernobyl.[26,31,51]
A major limitation of this study is the highly aggregated nature
of the data considered impeding causal inference in principle.
The only potential confounding variables controlled for were
time (secular trend), seasonality (month-to-month variation), and
the tsunami itself. Otherwise, we are not aware of any monthly
statistics on a prefecture-by-prefecture basis that reflects possible
confounding variables like stresses to pregnant women and any
other risk factors for PD that could be linked to the PD
occurrence in Japan before and after Fukushima. Ideally,
population based data on perinatal risk factors will be generated
to complement future investigations. Another problem is whether
the displacement of the population during the Tsunami and the
nuclear accident might have confounded our results and
conclusions. We are again not aware of any data concerning
this issue. However, if young parents have been exposed and put
at a higher risk for untoward pregnancy outcome prior to
displacement, this could have biased our effect estimates
downward, as corresponding PDs would have been counted in
the “unexposed” prefectures (exposure misclassification).
In view of the detrimental reproductive effects in Europe after
Chernobyl, and acknowledging the observed tentative spatio-
temporal ecological dose–response association between radiation
exposure and perinatal mortality 10 months after Fukushima,
we conjecture that the increases of PDs in the radioactively
contaminated prefectures in Japan may possibly be due to
radioactive releases by the Fukushima nuclear power plant
accident. It will be interesting to more precisely monitor the
future temporal development
of the various reproductive
outcome measures in Japan stratified by radiological exposure
to weaken or to corroborate our findings and conclusions.
As the Japanese Government plans to let inhabitants return to
areas prospectively exposed to radiation by less than 20mSv/a
(milli-Sieverts per year), our findings are relevant for the
resettlement of people formerly evacuated from the highly
contaminated zone, see http://www.pref.fukushima.lg.jp/site/
portal-english/rev-plan-3.html. The “Ottawa Charter of Health
Promotion”[52] emphasizes that political responsibility is needed
and that global and environmental factors play an important role
in the care for public health. To take political responsibility
requires full and continuous access to information, learning
opportunities in the various environmental health research
disciplines, as well as adequate funding support for ecological,
environmental, and medical investigations.[53]
