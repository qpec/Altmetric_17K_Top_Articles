and Lower Suicide Rates Among US Women

IMPORTANCE Previous studies have linked suicide risk with religious participation, but the
majority have used ecologic, cross-sectional, or case-control data.
OBJECTIVE To examine the longitudinal association between religious service attendance and
suicide and the joint associations of suicide with service attendance and religious affiliation.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS We evaluated associations between religious service
attendance and suicide from 1996 through June 2010 in a large, long-term prospective
cohort, the Nurses’Health Study, in an analysis that included 89 708 women. Religious
service attendance was self-reported in 1992 and 1996. Data analysis was conducted from
1996 through 2010.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to
examine the association between religious service attendance and suicide, adjusting for
demographic covariates, lifestyle factors, medical history, depressive symptoms, and social
integration measures. We performed sensitivity analyses to examine the influence of
unmeasured confounding.
RESULTS Among 89 708 women aged 30 to 55 years who participated in the Nurses’Health
Study, attendance at religious services once per week or more was associated with an
approximately 5-fold lower rate of suicide compared with never attending religious services
(hazard ratio, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.06-0.46). Service attendance once or more per week vs less
frequent attendance was associated with a hazard ratio of 0.05 (95% CI, 0.006-0.48) for
Catholics but only 0.34 (95% CI, 0.10-1.10) for Protestants (P = .05 for heterogeneity). Results
were robust in sensitivity analysis and to exclusions of persons who were previously
depressed or had a history of cancer or cardiovascular disease. There was evidence that social
integration, depressive symptoms, and alcohol consumption partially mediated the
association among those occasionally attending services, but not for those attending
frequently.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this cohort of US women, frequent religious service
attendance was associated with a significantly lower rate of suicide.

S
uicide is among the 10 leading causes of death in the
United States1: it is the fourth leading cause of death for
persons aged 18 to 65 years, and the risk increases later
in life.2-4 Despite improvements in mental health, the suicide
rate in the United States (12 per 100 000) is approximately the
same as it was more than 100 years ago.1-3 The major world re-
ligions have traditions prohibiting suicide, and various forms
of religious participation have been thought to be linked with
reduced risk of suicide.4,5 Empirical research on the topic was
made prominent by the 1897 work Suicide by sociologist Emile
Durkheim, who noted that, within Europe, suicide rates were
higher in Protestant regions than Catholic regions. He attrib-
uted the lower suicide rates among Catholics to greater reli-
gious integration and less individual autonomy in beliefs.6
Although there have been numerous studies of the asso-
ciation between various forms of religious participation and
suicide,2,4-12 most have serious methodological limitations.
Many of the studies, including Durkheim’
s, used ecologic data
andcouldnotcontrolforindividual-levelconfounding13;many
other studies use survey data but, as a result, can only exam-
ine suicidal ideation or suicide attempts10 rather than suicide
itself.Theassociationbetweenreligiousserviceattendanceand
suicide and ideation has also been studied using case-control
designs.8 Research with cohort designs is difficult owing to
the relatively low baseline rate of suicide. To our knowledge,
only 1 study to date has used cohort data to examine the as-
sociation between religious service attendance and suicide
itself,14 but it was not able to control for depressive symp-
toms, which are related to both suicide and religious service
attendance.2,4,15,16
Our objective was to examine the association between re-
ligiousserviceattendanceandsuicideandthejointassociations
ofsuicidewithserviceattendanceandreligiousaffiliationusing
the Nurses’ Health Study, a large prospective cohort study
amongUSwomenwithrepeatedmeasurementsofreligiousser-
vice attendance and detailed information on dietary, lifestyle,
social, psychological, and medical risk factors.
Methods
Study Design
The Nurses’Health study began in 1976 and included 121 700
nurses aged 30 to 55 years from across the United States.17 In-
formation on lifestyle and medical history was collected using
a questionnaire at baseline and every 2 years subsequently. In
our study, follow-up for suicide began with the measure of re-
ligious service attendance in 1996 and continued until sui-
cide, loss to follow-up, or the end of follow-up in June 2010.
Participants who died before 1996 or did not reply to the 1996
questionnaire (n = 27 122) or who had data missing on 1996 re-
ligiousserviceattendance(n = 7246)wereexcluded.Ourstudy
includes 89 708 participants with 1 528 538 person years. We
identified 36 suicides during follow-up. The study protocol for
the Nurses’Health Study was approved by the Brigham and
Women’
s Hospital and Harvard School of Public Health Insti-
tutional Review Boards. Study participants provided written
informed consent.
Religious service attendance was self-reported in 1992 and
1996. The questionnaire asked, “How often do you go to reli-
giousmeetingsorservices?”Responsecategoriesincludedmore
thanonceaweek,onceaweek,1to3timespermonth,lessthan
once per month, never, or almost never. The primary exposure
variable was attendance in 1996, with attendance in 1992 con-
trolled for as a covariate to examine the associations between
incident attendance and risk of suicide.
Deathswereidentifiedbyusingstatemortalityfilesandthe
US National Death Index and by reports from next of kin. We
defined suicide deaths using the International Classification
of Diseases, Eighth Revision definition for suicide and self-
inflicted injury (codes E950-E959), including suicide and self-
inflictedpoisoningbysolidorliquidsubstances(E950),bygases
indomesticuse(E951),orbyothergasesandvapors(E952);sui-
cideandself-inflictedinjurybyhanging,strangulation,andsuf-
focation (E953), by submersion (E954), by firearms and explo-
sives (E955), by cutting and piercing instruments (E956), by
jumping(E957),orbyotherandunspecifiedmeans(E958);and
late effects of self-inflicted injury (E959).
We selected covariates that were important predictors for
both general health and suicide, including age (as a continuous
variable);employmentstatus(part-time,full-time,unemployed,
or retired); family history of alcoholism (yes or no); body mass
index(calculatedasweightinkilogramsdividedbyheightinme-
ters squared; <20, 20-24.9, 25-29.9, 30-34.9, or ≥35); physical
activity (quintiles); caffeine intake (grams per day); alcohol in-
take (grams per day); smoking status (never, former, or current
[1-14, 15-24, and ≥25 cigarettes per day]); depressive symptoms
(yes or no); history of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, cancer, or
hypercholesterolemia(yesorno);familyincome(quintiles);live

Key Points
Question Is religious service attendance associated with lower
risk of suicide among US women?
Findings In a long-term cohort study, women who attended
religious services once or more per week had a 5-fold lower risk of
subsequent suicide compared with women who never attended
religious services; the inverse association of service attendance
with suicide was stronger for Catholics than for Protestants.
Meaning Frequent religious service attendance was associated
with substantially lower suicide risk among US women compared
with women who never attended religious services.

mentssubsequenttoreligiousattendanceexposuresweretaken
as mediators. For mediators, we considered depressive symp-
tomsin2000measuredusingtheCenterforEpidemiologicStud-
ies Depression-10 Scale,19 alcohol consumption in 1998, and
social integration in 2000.
Statistical Analysis
We examined the association of religious service attendance
with suicide using multivariable Cox proportional hazards re-
gression models. We calculated hazard ratios (HRs) and their
95% CIs, comparing frequency of religious service atten-
dance (once or more per week or less than once per week) vs
never attending. To accommodate the relatively small num-
ber of events, we also used exact logistic regression as a sen-
sitivity analysis, which was developed to address small num-
bers of events,20 and adjusted for depressive symptoms and
social support. We further stratified the analysis by religious
affiliation (Catholic vs Protestant).
We applied mediation analysis methods21,22 to examine
proportions of the association between religious service at-
tendance in 1996 and subsequent suicide that were mediated
by depressive symptoms, alcohol intake, and social integra-
tion. Methods for mediation assume that baseline covariates
suffice to control for exposure-outcome, mediator-outcome,
and exposure-mediator confounding.
We conducted several sensitivity analyses to assess the ro-
bustness of the results. To minimize the influence of reverse
causation, we additionally performed further analyses by ex-
cluding women who were depressed in 1996 (score of ≤52 on
the 5-item Mental Health Inventory, self-reported depressive
symptoms, or use of an antidepressant) and women who, in
1996, had a history of cancer (except nonmelanoma skin can-
cer) or a cardiovascular condition (myocardial infarction, coro-
nary artery bypass graft surgery, percutaneous transluminal
coronary angioplasty, or stroke). We used sensitivity analysis
to assess how substantial any unmeasured confounding would
need to be to explain the observed associations.23,24 All sta-
tisticalanalyseswereperformedfrom1996through2010using
the SAS Unix system (SAS Institute Inc).
Results
Among 89 708 women at the 1996 baseline, 17 028 attended
more than once per week, 36 488 attended once per week,
14 548 attended less than once per week, and 21 644 never at-
tended(Table1).MoststudyparticipantswereCatholicorProt-
estant.Womenwhoattendedreligiousservicesfrequentlywere
less likely to use an antidepressant (Table 1). They were also
less likely to be current smokers and more likely to be mar-
ried. There were 36 suicide events during follow-up, with sui-
cide incidence declining with increasing religious service
attendance (Figure; eTable 1 in the Supplement).
Using a multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression
model,comparedwithwomenwhoneverattendedreligiousser-
vices, women who attended religious services once per week
or more in 1996 had an approximately 5-fold lower rate of sui-
cide(adjustedHR,0.16;95%CI,0.06-0.45)(Table2).Whenfur-
theradjustmentwasmadeforthesocialintegrationscore(other
than religious service attendance), the HR was essentially un-
changed(0.16;95%CI,0.06-0.46).Resultswerealsosimilaraf-
ter excluding participants who were depressed in 1996 as de-
fined by a score of 52 or less on the 5-item Mental Health
Inventory, self-reported depressive symptoms, or use of anti-
depressants or after excluding those who had a history of can-
cer or of a cardiovascular condition in 1996 (eTable 2 in the
Supplement). The odds ratio from exact logistic regression to
addressthesmallnumberofsuicideeventswaslikewisesimilar
(0.17;95%CI,0.06-0.44).Resultswerealsosimilaracrossstrata
of attendance in 1992 (eTable 3 in the Supplement).
Even after contemporaneous adjustment in 1996 for all
other individual components of the social integration score,
the association between religious service attendance when
comparing once or more per week vs less often was similar and
substantial (HR, 0.17; 95% CI, 0.07-0.47), and was larger than
theeffectsizefora1-SDchangeinsocialintegrationscore,either
with religious service attendance excluded (HR, 0.82; 95% CI,
0.52-1.28)orincluded(HR,0.67;95%CI,0.41-1.10).Whenusing
a median split dichotomization, the effect size for religious ser-
vice attendance was also larger than that of any other single
component of the social integration score (eTable 4 in the
Supplement). The effect size for religious service attendance
was similar to or larger in magnitude than that of every other
covariate in the adjusted model (eTable 5 in the Supplement).
For an unmeasured confounder to explain the HR estimate
of0.16(95%CI,0.06-0.46),theunmeasuredconfounderwould
have to both increase the likelihood of religious service atten-
dance and decrease the likelihood of suicide by 12-fold above
and beyond the measured confounders; weaker confounding
wouldnotsuffice.Tobringtheestimate’
supperconfidencelimit
of0.46above1.0,theunmeasuredconfounderwouldstillhave
to both increase the likelihood of religious service attendance
anddecreasethelikelihoodofsuicideby3.7-foldaboveandbe-
yond the measured confounders.
There was evidence that the association between reli-
gious service attendance and suicide differed between Catho-
lic and Protestant participants: the religious service atten-
dance HR for Catholics for attending once per week or more
vs less often was 0.05 (95% CI, 0.006-0.48), which was
approximately 7-fold smaller than the analogous hazard for
Protestants (HR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.10-1.10) (P = .05 for hetero-
geneity) (Table 3).
We used mediation analysis to investigate whether de-
pressivesymptomsin2000,alcoholconsumptionin1998,and
subsequent social integration score in 2000 mediated the as-
sociationbetweenreligiousserviceattendanceandsuicide.No
single mediator seemed to explain much of the association
(Table 4). When adjustment was made for depressive symp-
toms, alcohol consumption, and social integration score to-
gether, the HR for those attending religious services less than
once per week vs not at all changed from 0.85 (95% CI, 0.36-
2.00) to 0.94 (95% CI, 0.40-2.23), accounting for about half
of the association; however, for those attending religious
services more than once per week vs not at all, the HR re-
mained essentially unchanged (0.16; 95% CI, 0.06-0.46)
(Table 4).

Discussion
In this large prospective cohort of 89 708 US nurses with
1 528 538 person-years of follow-up, we found a substantial
inverse association between frequent religious service
attendance and risk of suicide. Compared with women
who had never attended religious services, women who
attended religious services once or more per week had a
more than 5-fold lower risk of suicide; results were robust

across various exclusions, methods of analysis, and in sensi-
tivity analysis.
Our results are consistent with other literature suggest-
ing an inverse association between religious participation and
suicide.7-14 In contrast to other studies, however, we used lon-
gitudinal cohort data rather than cross-sectional or ecologic
data;wemadeextensiveadjustmentforconfounding;wewere
able to examine incident rather than prevalent religious ser-
viceattendancebycontrollingforpastattendance;andwewere
able to examine suicide itself rather than suicidal ideation or
suicide attempts. We were also able to control for depressive
symptoms, which are related to both suicide and service
attendance.15,16 Although other aspects of social integration
are also associated with reduced rates of suicide,25,26 when we
compared the effect size of religious service attendance with
social integration components, it was religious service atten-
dance itself that seemed most prominent among these asso-
ciations. Subsequent social support seemed to mediate little
of the association between religious service attendance and
suicide.
In examining the potential pathways from religious ser-
vice attendance to suicide, depressive symptoms, social inte-
gration, and alcohol consumption seem to explain some of the
associationforthoseattendinglessthanonceperweekbutlittle
of the association for those attending once per week or more.
The mediation estimates were limited by the potential for sui-
cide to occur before the mediators were measured and by the
use of mediators measured at a single point in time. Never-
theless, the evidence seems to indicate an association inde-
pendent of these pathways. It is likely that religious service at-
tendanceisitselfassociatedwiththebeliefthatsuicideiswrong
and that this belief may be the primary pathway. This hypoth-
esis has been proposed previously with some preliminary em-
pirical evidence to support it.12,27 Religious reasons some-
times given for prohibitions against suicide include the
following: life being a gift from God, suicide being against the
natural order, suicide causing injury to the community, sui-
cide encouraging others to follow a similar course, and death
being this life’
s greatest evil.28,29 That most of the association
in our analysis was not explained by depressive symptoms, al-
cohol consumption, or social integration is consistent with
moral beliefs being the dominant pathway. Future research
could also examine other potential mediators, such as hope-
lessness or the meaning and purpose in life.
Our results suggested that the inverse association of reli-
gious service attendance with suicide was stronger for
Catholics than Protestants. The result is of historic and
sociological significance since, in the 1897 work Suicide—a
book that both strongly influenced research on religion
and health and shaped the discipline of sociology
itself—Durkheim6 had noted that, within Europe, suicide
rates were higher in Protestant than Catholic regions. Durk-
heim’
s analysis, and many since, used ecologic data and has
thus been criticized on these grounds.4,7,30 Although

Durkheim’
s analysis was replicated using individual-level
data in Switzerland with similar results,11 our analyses sug-
gest that the lower suicide rates among Catholics vs Protes-
tants may in fact apply only to those regularly attending reli-
gious services, with the inverse association between service
attendance and suicide was stronger for Catholics than for
Protestants.
AlthoughtheNurses’HealthStudywasnottargetedtoapar-
ticularreligiousgroup,thestudysampleinfactconsistsmainly
of white Christians and entirely of US female nurses. The sui-
ciderateinoursamplewasabouthalfofthatonaverageamong
US women.2 Our results might thus not be generalizable to the
general US population, to men, to other races, to other coun-
tries, or to areas with limited religious freedom.31 Our results
are consistent with previous research among African Ameri-
can individuals on suicidal ideation and behaviors,32,33 al-
thoughsuicideratesareingeneralloweramongAfricanAmeri-
can individuals,2 and patterns across religious denominations
may also differ for African American individuals.
Althoughreligiousserviceattendancehascommonlybeen
used in previous published studies and tends to be the stron-
gest religious predictor of health,4 religiosity is multidimen-
sional, and different aspects of religion and spirituality may
therefore be differently associated with suicide. Data on reli-
gious service attendance were collected through a self-
reported questionnaire and, moreover, may be subject to mea-
surement error and possible overreporting, although the
relative ordering of frequency might still be preserved. Fur-
ther research could examine other religious practices, mind-
fulness practices, other aspects of spirituality and religiosity,
other race/ethnic and demographic groups, and other forms
of social participation.
Our study made use of observational data. Although we
adjusted for major confounders regarding the association be-
tweenreligiousserviceattendanceandsuicide,theresultsmay
still be subject to unmeasured confounding by personality, im-
pulsivity, feelings of hopelessness, or other cognitive factors.
However, in sensitivity analysis, for an unmeasured con-
founder to explain the effect of religious service attendance
on suicide, it would have to both increase the likelihood of re-
ligious service attendance and decrease the likelihood of sui-
cide by greater than 10-fold above and beyond the measured
covariates. Such substantial confounding by unmeasured fac-
tors seems unlikely, given adjustment for an extensive set of
covariates and the known risk factor associations for
suicide.34,35TheresultscomparingCatholicandProtestantpar-
ticipants could also be subject to differential misclassifica-
tion of suicide by affiliation,36 with Catholics potentially un-
derreporting suicide events owing to suicide being considered
a mortal sin. Suicide events were identified using the US Na-
tional Death Index as well as reports from next of kin. In some
cases, suicide events may be missed if the family members
choose not to share. Although such misclassification might
affect comparisons between Catholics and Protestants, it may
be less likely to affect hazard ratios for religious service atten-
dance within strata of affiliation. Our results were based on a
relatively small number of events, which can make modeling
difficult; however, results were similar when using an exact
logistic regression technique intended to address small event
numbers. The small number of events also creates consider-
able uncertainty in the religious service attendance esti-
mates stratified by affiliation.
Our study was intended to overcome methodological
limitations in previous research. Strengths of our study
include a large sample size, long duration of follow-up, a
prospective cohort study design, repeated measures of reli-
gious service attendance, and extensive control for con-
founding. We have clear temporality of the covariates, expo-
sure, and outcome. We were able to adjust for baseline
religious service attendance level to avoid reverse causation
and to estimate the effect of incident exposure; we were
also able to adjust for depressive symptoms and social sup-
port as potential confounders.
Conclusions
Inthislarge,prospective,long-termcohortstudyofUSwomen,
frequent religious service attendance was associated with sub-
stantiallylowersuiciderisk.Ourresultsdonotimplythathealth
care providers should prescribe attendance at religious ser-
vices. However, for patients who are already religious, ser-
vice attendance might be encouraged as a form of meaning-
ful social participation. Religion and spirituality may be an
underappreciated resource that psychiatrists and clinicians
could explore with their patients, as appropriate.
