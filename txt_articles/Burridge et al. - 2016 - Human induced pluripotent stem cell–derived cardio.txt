Abstract
Doxorubicin (Adriamycin) is an anthracycline chemotherapy agent effective in treating a wide 
range of malignancies with a well–established dose–response cardiotoxic side effect that can lead 
to heart failure. At present, it is not possible to predict which patients will be affected by 
doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity (DIC). Here we demonstrate that patient–specific human 
induced pluripotent stem cell–derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC–CMs) can recapitulate individual 
patients’ predilection to DIC at the single cell level. hiPSC–CMs derived from breast cancer 
patients who suffered clinical DIC are consistently more sensitive to doxorubicin toxicity, 
demonstrating decreased cell viability, mitochondrial and metabolic function, calcium handling, 
and antioxidant pathway activity, along with increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production 
compared to hiPSC–CMs from patients who did not experience DIC. Together, our data indicate 
that hiPSC–CMs are a suitable platform for identifying and verifying the genetic basis and 
molecular mechanisms of DIC.
Introduction
The anthracycline doxorubicin, one of the first chemotherapeutic agents to be introduced, is 
still one of the the most common and effective antineoplastic drugs currently in use1. 
Despite the advent of targeted tyrosine kinase- and monoclonal antibody-based therapies, 
anthracyclines are still used for 40–50% of breast cancer patients2, commonly alongside the 
alkylating agent cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan) or the antimicrotuble taxanes paclitaxel 
(Taxol) or docetaxel (Taxotere). The cardiotoxic side effects of doxorubicin are well 
established3, 4. Even at relatively low cumulative concentrations of 200–250 mg m−2, the 
risk of cardiotoxicity is estimated at 7.8% to 8.8%5, 6. The cardiotoxic side effects 
experienced with doxorubicin can range from asymptomatic reductions in left ventricular 
ejection fraction (LVEF), to tachycardia and arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy, myocardial 
infarction, and highly symptomatic congestive heart failure (Class III to IV)7, 8. At present, it 
is not possible to predict which patients will be affected by DIC or adequately protect 
patients who are at risk for suffering this devastating side effect9.
The anti-cancer effects of doxorubicin are thought to be threefold: via the stabilization of the 
toposimerase II α (TOP2A)–DNA cleavage complex, preventing DNA religation and double 
stranded cut repair; the intercalation of doxorubicin with double-stranded DNA directly 
resulting in transcriptome and epigenome modulation; and the generation of free radicals. 
The cardiotoxic effects of doxorubicin are thought to be more complex, but can be grouped 
into three interrelated subsets, generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), toposimerase II 
β (TOP2B)10 and TOP1MT11 inhibition, and calcium release12.
The generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by redox cycling within cardiomyocytes, 
both dependent and independent of iron, causes mitochondrial dysregulation, lipid 
peroxidation, DNA damage, and protein carbonylation. ROS can be deactivated by 
endogenous antioxidants such as glutathione peroxidase, catalase and superoxide dismutase, 
yet doxorubicin also directly reduces the activity of these antioxidants, further increasing

 oxidative stress7. The mitochondria are the major site of doxorubicin-induced ROS 
generation due to the localization of the major redox cycling enzymes such as NAD(P)H and 
that doxorubicin becomes nearly irreversibly bound to cardiolipin on the mitochondrial 
membrane13. Doxorubicin also increases mitochondrial iron accumulation which further 
increases ROS production in the mitochondria14. Topoismerase inhibition (including TOP2B 
and TOP1MT) causes transcriptional modulation of the cell and mitochondrial genomes, 
DNA damage-induced apoptosis, and specifically, TOP2B has been associated with 
PPARGC1A and PPARGC1B (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma 
coactivator 1-α and -β) induced reduction in mitochondrial biogenesis10. Finally, 
doxorubicin and its metabolite doxorubicinol can induce Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic 
reticulum (SR) causing Ca2+ overload that leads to sarcomeric disarray and myofibril 
deterioration12, 15.
Here we demonstrate hiPSC–CMs derived from breast cancer patients who experienced 
doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity successfully recapitulate this phenotype. As the patient-
specific human gene expression response to doxorubicin is essentially unknown, we go on 
extensively probe the transcriptomes associated with patient–specific cardiotoxicity 
responses. Finally, we show that hiPSC-CMs from patients with toxicity have significant 
reduction in basal metabolism and mitochondrial content.
Results
Generation of patient–specific hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes
We recruited twelve female patients: eight breast cancer patients who had been treated at 
Stanford University Hospital with 240 mg m−2 doxorubicin or equivalent (Supplementary 
Table 1), including four patients (referred to as ‘DOX’) who did not experience clinical 
cardiotoxicity (as documented by minimum post–treatment LVEF > 56%); four patients 
(‘DOXTOX’) who did experience clinical cardiotoxicity (post–treatment LVEF = 10–45%); 
and four age– and gender–matched control volunteers who had never been treated with any 
chemotherapeutic agent (‘Healthy’) (Supplementary Table 2). We derived hiPSCs from these 
patients16 and all lines passed common assessments for pluripotency17 and genomic 
stability18 (Supplementary Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 2). We differentiated hiPSCs into 
cardiomyocytes19, with modifications to the differentiation protocol to enhance 
cardiomyocyte purity20, mitochondrial metabolism21, and maturation22, resulting in 
cardiomyocyte purities of >85% (Supplementary Fig. 3). We based suitable in vitro hiPSC–
CM doxorubicin treatments on the terminal plasma half–life of doxorubicin of 20–48 h, and 
peak plasma concentration (Cmax) of 2–6 µg ml−1 (average 6.9 µM) for a single 
concentration of 60 mg m−2 23, 24. Therefore, we primarily used concentrations in this range 
(0.1 µM to 10 µM). We selected time points of 24 h and 72 h based on prior reports on 
primary neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes (NRVMs)25–27.
Characterization of in vitro doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity
We began by establishing whether a differential response to doxorubicin existed between 
Healthy, DOX, and DOXTOX hiPSC–CM groups. Immunofluorescent imaging 
demonstrated a concentration–response increase in sarcomeric disarray, a well–established

 effect of doxorubicin on NRVMs28, 29, which was consistently seen at 0.1 µM in the 
DOXTOX cells but not in DOX cells (Fig. 1a). Cardiomyocyte contraction assays 
demonstrated increased beat rates in DOX cells at 1 µM and increasing arrhythmia at higher 
concentrations, which was more severe in DOXTOX cells (Fig. 1b, c). After 72 h treatment 
with doxorubicin, the four DOXTOX hiPSC–CM lines consistently showed significantly 
reduced cell viability compared to the four DOX and four Healthy hiPSC–CM lines at all 
concentrations tested (F–test statistic = 170.5, P < 0.0001), with an LD50 of 0.1643 µM for 
the DOXTOX cells and 3.015 µM for the DOX cells (Fig. 1d). This increase in doxorubicin 
cardiotoxicity susceptibility could be further validated using a wide range of assays: 
membrane integrity and maintenance of a reducing environment, ATP quantitation, 
adenylate kinase release, and lactate dehydrogenase release (Supplementary Fig 4a–e). Flow 
cytometry demonstrated a concentration–dependent increase in cells double–positive for 
annexin V+ and 7-aminoactinomycin D (7–AAD), suggesting programmed cell death as the 
principal mechanism of cell loss. A significant (P < 0.005) increase in annexin V+ and 7–
AAD+ cells was also noted in DOXTOX hiPSC–CMs compared to DOX hiPSC–CMs at 
higher doxorubicin concentrations (Fig. 1e). A second assay for apoptosis, the measurement 
of caspase 3 and 7, further confirmed this result (Fig. 1f).
Given that the therapeutic mechanism of doxorubicin in tumor cells is via induction of DNA 
damage, we next assessed the level of double–stranded DNA damage by staining for 
phosphorylated H2A histone family member X (γ–H2AX). Similarly, we observed a 
concentration–dependent increase in DNA damage (Fig. 2a), which was significantly (P < 
0.005) higher in DOXTOX hiPSC–CMs at the 0.1 µM and 1 µM doxorubicin concentrations 
(Fig. 2b). To probe the potential mechanisms for the observed differences in response to 
doxorubicin, we next assessed spontaneous Ca2+ transients by loading single cells with 
Fluo–4 (Fig. 2c). In DOXTOX hiPSC–CM samples treated with 1 µM or 10 µM 
doxorubicin, there was a significant (P < 0.005) increase in the transient decay time (decay 
tau) in the DOXTOX hiPSC–CM over the DOX hiPSC–CM group (Fig. 2d), likely a 
function of the reduced transient amplitude and time to peak (Supplementary Fig. 4f, g). No 
significant effect on beat rate between groups was detected (Supplementary Fig 4h).
Several studies have implicated oxidative stress, as evidenced by increased ROS, as the 
central mechanism underlying the cardiotoxic effects of doxorubicin30–33. We next assessed 
cellular ROS production by flow cytometry using the fluorescent CellROX probe. After 24 h 
of doxorubicin, ROS was significantly (P < 0.005) higher in the DOXTOX hiPSC–CMs 
compared to the DOX hiPSC–CMs by an average of >2–fold after 0.1 to 10 µM (Fig. 2e). A 
second assay measuring whole cell hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) confirmed this >2–fold 
increase in ROS from concentrations as low as 0.01 µM doxorubicin (Fig. 3a). We next 
assayed the antioxidant glutathione (GSH) as a marker of cellular oxidative stress response 
and found a significantly (P < 0.005) greater drop in GSH levels in DOXTOX hiPSC–CMs 
at lower levels of doxorubicin than DOX hiPSC–CMs (EC50 of 0.04 µM vs. 0.8 µM) (Fig. 
3b). Mitochondria are one of the major sources of increased ROS production and also a 
target for doxorubicin toxicity. Using a mitochondrial superoxide probe (MitoSOX), we 
demonstrated significantly (P < 0.005) higher levels of mitochondrial ROS in the DOXTOX 
hiPSC–CMs compared to DOX hiPSC–CMs (>2.5–fold at 10 µM) (Fig. 3c). Finally, we 
demonstrated that there was a consistent concentration–dependent decrease in mitochondrial

 membrane potential to doxorubicin using the JC–10 probe, which was significantly (P < 
0.01) greater in the DOXTOX hiPSC–CMs vs. DOX hiPSC–CMs at 0.1 to 10 µM (Fig. 3d).
To help further understand the mechanisms of action, we pre– and co–treated hiPSC–CMs 
with the cardioprotectant dexrazoxane (DRZ)34, a catalytic topoisomerase inhibitor and iron 
chelator, used clinically to try to reduce doxorubicin cardiotoxicity35. Unexpectedly, we 
found that DRZ significantly (P < 0.005) increased toxicity, specifically in DOXTOX 
hiPSC–CMs at 0.1 µM and DOX hiPSC–CMs at 3 µM (Fig. 3e). To determine whether this 
effect was a problem with our model or limited to this one agent, we next assessed the 
effects of a well–established antioxidant, N–acetyl–L–cysteine (NAC)36. NAC significantly 
(P < 0.005) decreased doxorubicin–induced toxicity in DOXTOX hiPSC–CMs (Fig. 3f), 
confirming that ROS–based toxicity is a major component of reduced viability
Effect on doxorubicin on patient-specific gene expression
We hypothesized that the mechanism of DIC may vary depending on the concentration of 
doxorubicin. To probe this question, we began by performing microarray analysis on control 
hiPSC–CMs exposed to increasing concentrations of doxorubicin (Fig. 4a). After 24 h 
doxorubicin treatment, minimal changes were seen with 0.1 µM concentration. By contrast, 
numerous cardiac development-related transcription factors were significantly down-
regulated at 1 µM concentration compared to the untreated group, including NKX2–5 
(homeobox protein Nkx-2.5), MEF2A (myocyte-specific enhancer factor 2), TBX5 (T-box 
transcription factor TBX5), and MYOCD (myocardin) (Supplementary Table 3). Using 
Ingenuity Toxicogenomics analysis, we found that TGF–β signaling, p53, cardiac 
hypertrophy, G1/S checkpoint regulation, and retinoic acid receptor activation were 
differentially regulated between the 1 µM and 10 µM groups (Supplementary Table 4). We 
next applied the unsupervised machine learning approach Independent Component 
Analysis37 to discover 8 modules of gene expression related to the different concentrations 
of doxorubicin, identifying key transcription regulators such as TP53 (tumor protein p53), 
RELA (v-rel avian reticuloendotheliosis viral oncogene homolog A), NFKB1 (nuclear factor 
of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells 1), and EP300 (E1A binding protein 
p300) that have previously been classified as involved in doxorubicin pharmacodynamics 
and cardiotoxicity pathways by PharmGKB38 (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Fig. 5a,b).
To identify a genetic rationale for the observed differences in response to doxorubicin in the 
DOX and DOXTOX cohorts, we next performed RNA–seq on hiPSC–CMs derived from 
three DOX and three DOXTOX lines, both with and without 1 µM doxorubicin exposure for 
24 h, and after normalizing for baseline expression in untreated cells (Fig. 4c) and identified 
the most differentially regulated genes between the DOX and DOXTOX hiPSC–CM 
populations after doxorubicin treatment (Fig. 4d and Supplementary Fig. 5c). The relative 
activity of gene modules in the concentration–response microarray experiment is nicely 
recapitulated (Fig. 4e and Supplementary Figure 6a, b). Modules 1–3 explain 41%, 39%, 
and 7.8% of the total expression variances, respectively, whereas in the patient-response 
study, the three modules explain 0.7%, 73%, and 16%, respectively.
An independent pairwise comparison of the DOX vs. DOXTOX at baseline and DOX vs. 
DOXTOX at 1 µM again identified RELA, NFKB1, and RARA (retinoic acid receptor

 alpha) with significantly (P < 1.8 × 10−4) altered target gene expression, and signal 
transducer and activator of transcription 3 as significant signaling pathway, which were 
previously described39, 40 (Supplementary Table 5). In addition, we identified significantly 
(q < 1.3 × 10−2) increased expression of Programed Cell Death, p53 downstream pathway, 
and target genes of transcription factors TP53, BRCA1 (breast cancer 1), PALB2 (partner 
and localizer of BRCA2), STAT3, CEBPA (CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha), and 
PPARG (peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma), and significant (q < 1.3 × 10−2) 
decreases of Muscle Contraction, Cholesterol Biosynthesis, Anatomical Structure 
Development, and target genes of SUZ12 (SUZ12 polycomb repressive complex 2 subunit), 
CTBP2 (C-terminal binding protein 2), EPAS1 (endothelial PAS domain protein 1), and 
RAD21 (RAD21 cohesin complex component) in DOXTOX hiPSC–CMs treated with 1 µM 
doxorubicin compared to the untreated group (Fig. 4f, Supplementary Fig. 6c and 
Supplementary Table 6). Based on the RNA–seq data, we determined the coding sequence 
variant for BRCA1, BRCA2 (breast cancer 2) and PALB2 and found that homozygous non–
synonymous variants in BRCA1 might be associated with DOXTOX subject cardiotoxicity 
(data not shown).
We next examined the expression of genes identified by PharmGKB38 as associated with 
DIC. Genes differentially expressed between the DOX and DOXTOX populations include 
those associated with redox cycling of doxorubicin and production of ROS NQO2 
(NAD(P)H dehydrogenase, quinone 2), the generation of reactive nitrogen species NOS3 
(nitric oxide synthase 3 (endothelial cell), and those associated with antioxidants such as 
SOD3 (superoxide dismutase 3), although no variance was found in CAT (catalase)41 (Fig. 
5a and Supplementary Fig. 7a, b). We found significant (P < 0.05) differences in CAPN6 
(calpain 6), which is involved in the Ca2+ overload response28, although we noted no 
differences in other calcium handling–related genes (Supplementary Fig. 7c). The down–
regulation of cardiac structural genes in response to doxorubicin is well established26, 42, 
and we confirmed a consistent down regulation of such transcripts as MYH7 (β–myosin 
heavy chain) and TNNI3 (cardiac troponin I), among others, after doxorubicin treatment in 
both populations (Fig. 5b, Supplementary Fig. 7d). Additionally, we found significant (P < 
0.05) differences in genes involved with iron transport and storage32 (Supplementary Fig. 
7e), chromatin remodeling and chemotherapy resistance-related gene SMARCA4 (SWI/SNF 
related, matrix associated, actin dependent regulator of chromatin, subfamily a, member 4)43 
(Supplementary Fig. 7f), and apoptosis signaling40 (Fig. 5b, Supplementary Fig. 7g), as well 
as genes previously identified by DIC targeted SNP studies44 (Supplementary Fig. 7h). 
PPARGC1A was less down-regulated in DOXTOX cells than DOX cells after doxorubicin 
treatment and PPARGC1B was upregulated in DOXTOX cells and up-regulated in DOX 
cells after doxorubicin treatment (Fig. 5b). Finally, significant (P < 0.01) differences were 
also noted in STAT1 and STAT3, and BRCA1 and BRCA2 (Fig. 5b and Supplementary Fig. 
7i).
Patient-specific baseline metabolic variance
As mitochondrial function has been identified as a key component of DIC45, we next 
performed a baseline mitochondrial stress test in DOX and DOXTOX hiPSC–CMs using a 
Seahorse XF24 extracellular flux analyzer (Fig. 5c). More extreme reductions in basal and

 maximal respiration in DOXTOX cells were also noted after doxorubicin treatments, 
particularly with 1 and 10 µM treatment (Supplementary Fig. 8a–d). Surprisingly, even 
without doxorubicin treatment, variance was noted in the basal respiration, maximal 
mitochondrial respiration, and spare respiratory capacity, as assessed by subjecting cells to 
FCCP (carbonyl cyanide-4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone), which promotes a 
dissipation of the membrane potential and leads to an increase in oxygen consumption that is 
accompanied by a decrease in ATP synthesis (Fig. 5d). To further probe this result, we 
assessed baseline ATP activity and found this to be significantly (P < 0.01) lower in 
DOXTOX hiPSC–CMs than that of healthy and DOX hiPSC–CMs (Fig. 5e). Western blot 
for select proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation showed a similar trend (Fig. 5f and 
Supplementary Fig. 8e), as did quantification of citrate synthase activity, a marker for 
mitochondrial content (Fig. 5g). We then compared nuclear vs. mitochondrial DNA content 
as a surrogate to estimate the relative cellular mitochondrial content. DOXTOX hiPSC–CMs 
contained ~30.1±2.4% fewer mitochondria than DOX hiPSC–CMs (Fig. 5h). To determine 
whether this was generalizable to other cell types, we also assessed mitochondrial content 
directly in patient fibroblasts and undifferentiated hiPSCs, but did not find a significant 
difference (Fig. 5i, j). To further study whether patient–derived fibroblasts or hiPSCs could 
be used as a surrogate for predicting DIC, we performed viability assays with 5–log range 
concentrations of doxorubicin. In contrast to our results with hiPSC–CMs, we found that 
these cell types could not recapitulate patient response to doxorubicin (Supplementary Fig. 
9).
Discussion
Although the effects of doxorubicin on pure populations of cardiomyocytes in vitro may not 
mimic all processes that occur in vivo, our results suggest that, patient–specific hiPSC–CMs 
can recapitulate patients’ predilection to DIC and enable the prediction of clinical 
susceptibilities of high–risk populations to drug–induced cardiotoxicity. The differences 
between DOX and DOXTOX hiPSC–CMs manifest at multiple points in the DIC 
mechanism (summarized in Fig. 6) and these differences are not detectable in other patient-
derived cell types such as fibroblasts or hiPSCs. In particular, we confirm numerous DIC 
phenotypes shown in animal models, particularly concentrating on the ROS pathways and 
mitochondrial dysregulation.
The hiPSC-CM model has weaknesses, such as a lack of suitable maturity46 and sub-type 
specificity47 and a lack of co-localization with other cell types found in the heart such as 
fibroblasts and endothelial cells48. Yet this is also one of the model’s great strengths as 
immature cells are easier to dissociate, pure cells are more suited to plate assays and high–
content imaging, and RNA-seq analysis is more accurate due to the lack of contamination 
with other cell types. The demonstration here that this human surrogate system is suitable 
for assessing patient–specific DIC will allow the future validation of gene variants identified 
through genome–wide association studies (GWAS)49. This platform also holds considerable 
promise for the discovery of novel DIC cardioprotectants, although our data on the lack of 
efficacy of the iron-chelator dexrazoxane but success of the antioxidant NAC may highlight 
the differences between a whole-animal model and an in vitro isolated cardiomyocyte-
model. In particular, it is thought that the heart is uniquely at risk to DIC due to high

 proportion of cardiomyocyte mitochondria, making up 35% of the total cell volume50. In 
hiPSC-CMs, however, mitochondrial numbers are lower51, and the confirmation of this 
‘mitochondrial content’ risk effect will require further analysis. Finally, our work on 
variation of basal metabolism needs to take into account that all cells (fibroblasts, hiPSC, 
and hiPSC-CMs) were derived after patients had received doxorubicin, and any systemic 
damage to the genomic or mitochondrial DNA in the original patient fibroblasts used for 
reprogramming may be carried over in these cell types. Therefore a better model in the 
future would be to derive hiPSCs prior to doxorubicin treatment and perform similar sets of 
experiments outlined here. Although this would require significantly larger patient subjects, 
it would move us toward precision medicine for cardio-oncology.

Human induced pluripotent cell derivation
All pluripotent and reprogramming cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a New Brunswick 
Galaxy 170R humidified incubator (Eppendorf) with 5% CO2 and 5% O2. Primary cell and 
differentiation cultures were maintained at 5% CO2 and 21% O2. Protocols were approved 
by the Stanford University Human Subjects Research Institutional Review Board. With 
informed written consent, two 2–mm skin punch biopsies were taken from each volunteer, 
diced with a scalpel, digested with 1 mg ml−1 collagenase IV (Life Technologies) for 2 h at 
37 °C. Fibroblasts were then grown in DMEM with GlutaMAX (Life Technologies) 
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, US origin, Life Technologies) on 6–well 
plates (Greiner) coated with a 1:200 dilution of growth–factor reduced Matrigel (9 µg cm−2, 
Corning). Media was changed every other day. When confluent (~1 week), fibroblasts were 
passaged with TrypLE Express (Life Technologies) onto Matrigel–coated T225 flasks 
(Thermo Scientific Nunc). For Sendai virus reprogramming, early passage (p2–p3) 
fibroblasts were seeded at 40,000 cells per well on Synthemax II–SC (625 ng cm−2, 
Corning)–coated52 6–well plates in E853. E8 was made in–house and consisted of 
DMEM/F12 (10–092–CM, Corning), 20 µg ml−1 E. coli–derived recombinant human insulin 
(Life Technologies), 64 µg ml−1 L–ascorbic acid 2–phosphate sesquimagnesium salt hydrate 
(Sigma–Aldrich), 10.7 µg ml−1 Oryza sativa–derived recombinant human transferrin 
(Optiferrin, InVitria/Sigma–Aldrich), 14 ng ml−1 sodium selenite (Sigma–Aldrich), 100 ng 
ml−1 recombinant human FGF2 (154 amino acid, E. coli–derived, Peprotech), 2 ng ml−1 
recombinant human TGFβ1 (112 amino acid, HEK293–derived, Peprotech), and 100 ng 
ml−1 heparin sodium salt (>180 U mg−1, Sigma–Aldrich). After 24 h, media was changed to 
fresh E8 and supplemented with four CytoTune–iPS Sendai Reprogramming Kit viral 
particle factors (Life Technologies)54 diluted to 20% of the manufacturer’s 
recommendations (3 × 105 cell infectious units [CIU] of each particle per well, multiplicity 
of infection [MOI] = 7.5). Media was changed after 24 h and thereafter once every day. For 
the first 7 days, cultures were maintained in E8 supplemented with 100 nM hydrocortisone 
(Sigma–Aldrich) and 200 µM sodium butyrate (Sigma–Aldrich) to enhance reprogramming 
efficiency55. At day 7, cells were passaged with TrypLE Express and seeded onto 
Synthemax II–SC–coated 6–well plate in E7N media (E8 minus TGFβ1; supplemented with 
200 µM sodium butyrate). 10 µM Y27632 (Biorbyt) was added for the first 24 h after

in 6–well plates by passaging 1:1, 1:4, 1:6, 1:8, and finally 1:12 using 0.5 mM EDTA (Life 
Technologies) in DPBS without Ca2+ or Mg2+ (Life Technologies) for 6 min at RT. Specific 
hiPSC clones used for this study were: 59FSDNC3 (DOX1), 60FSDNC1 (DOX2), 
64FSDNC1 (DOX3), 65FSDNC2 (DOX4), 31FSDNC14 (DOXTOX1), 40FSDNC15 
(DOXTOX2), 51FSDNC18 (DOXTOX3), and 79FSDNC1 (DOXTOX4). For hESC 
experiments, the line H7 (WA07)56 was used (WiCell Research Institute).
Human induced pluripotent stem cell culture
Cells were routinely maintained in E8 (made as above) on 1:200 growth factor–reduced 
Matrigel (9 µg cm−2) and passaged every 3–4 days using 0.5 mM EDTA (as above). Cell 
lines were used between passages 20 and 85. All cultures (primary, pluripotent, and 
differentiation) were maintained with 2 ml media per 10 cm2 of surface area or equivalent. 
All cultures were routinely tested for mycoplasma using a MycoAlert Plus Kit (Lonza).
Immunofluorescence staining for pluripotency markers
For assessment of pluripotency, hiPSCs were passaged with EDTA and plated onto 
Synthemax II–SC–coated (625 ng cm−2) Lab–Tek II 8–chamber glass slides (Thermo 
Scientific Nunc) in E8 with 10 µM Y27632 (for 24 h) and allowed to grow for 3 days. Cells 
were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Services) in DPBS (Life 
Technologies) for 10 min at RT, permeabilized with 0.1% saponin (Sigma–Aldrich) in DPBS 
for 20 min at RT, blocked in 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA, Sigma–Aldrich) in DPBS for 
15 min at RT, and stained with 1:200 monoclonal mouse IgM TRA–1–60 (sc–21705), 1:200 
monoclonal mouse IgM TRA–1–81 (sc–21706), 1:200 monoclonal mouse IgG3 SSEA4 (sc–
21704), 1:200 monoclonal mouse IgG2b POU5F1 (sc–5279), 1:200 monoclonal mouse IgG1 
NANOG (sc–33759), or 1:200 monoclonal mouse IgG1 SOX2 (sc–365823) in 0.1% saponin 
in DPBS overnight at 4 °C. Cells were washed and then stained with secondary antibodies 
1:250 Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti–mouse IgM, or Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti–mouse IgG3, and 
1:250 Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti–mouse IgG2b or Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti–mouse IgG1 (all 
Life Technologies) in 0.1% saponin in DPBS for 1 h at RT in the dark. Cells were washed 
three times and mounted with ProLong Diamond Antifade Mountant with DAPI (Life 
Technologies). Slides were imaged with a DM IL LED inverted fluorescent microscope 
(Leica Microsystems) at 40× and with a DFC550 camera (Leica Microsystems) and LAS X 
software and processed using Volocity 6.0 (PerkinElmer).
Flow cytometry to assess pluripotency
For assessment of pluripotency, hiPSCs at three days after passage were dissociated with 
TrypLE Express for 3 min at 37 °C and 1 million cells were transferred to flow cytometry 
tubes (BD Biosciences). Cells were then fixed with 4% PFA in DPBS for 10 min, 
permeabilized with 0.1% saponin (Sigma–Aldrich) in DPBS for 20 min, and stained using 
1:50 mouse IgM TRA–1–81-488 (BD Biosciences, 560173), mouse IgG3 SSEA4-488 (BD 
Biosciences 560308), POU5F1-488 (BD Biosciences, 560217), or SOX2 (BD Biosciences, 
245610) for 30 min at RT. Isotype controls FITC mouse IgM κ (BD Biosciences, 555583)

557715) were used to establish gating. Cells were analyzed using a FACSAria II (BD 
Biosciences) with a 100 µM nozzle and FACSDiva software. Data was analyzed using 
FlowJo (Tree Star).
Quantitative Real–time PCR
To analyze pluripotent gene expression, cells were dissociated with TrypLE Express for 5 
min at 37 °C, triturated and diluted in E8 and centrifuged at 200 g for 4 min. Media was 
aspirated and pellets of cells were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. RNA 
was isolated using an RNeasy Plus kit (QIAGEN), cDNA was produced using a High 
Capacity RNA–to–cDNA kit (Life Technologies), and real–time PCR was performed using 
TaqMan Gene Expression Assays 18S (Hs99999901_s1), NANOG (Hs02387400_g1), 
POU5F1 (Hs00999632_g1), SOX2 (Hs01053049_s1), KLF4 (Hs00358836_m1), LIN28

(Hs99999147_m1), TaqMan Gene Expression Master Mix, and a 7900HT Real–Time PCR 
System (Life Technologies). All PCR reactions were performed in quadruplicate, 
normalized to 18S endogenous control gene, and assessed using the comparative Ct 
method5.
Teratoma analysis
Three confluent wells of pluripotent cells were dissociated with 0.5 mM EDTA, centrifuged 
at 200 g for 4 min, resuspended in 100 µl of growth factor–reduced Matrigel, and injected 
into the kidney capsule of female NOD–SCID mice (NOD.CB17–Prkdcscid/NcrCrl Strain 
code 394, Charles River). After 4–6 weeks, teratomas were removed, fixed in 4% PFA, 
embedded in paraffin wax, sectioned, and hematoxylin– and eosin–stained (H&E) by the 
Stanford Tissue Bank. Slides were imaged and analyzed by a qualified clinical pathologist.
Single nucleotide polymorphism karyotyping
A single well of >p20 pluripotent cells was dissociated with 0.5 mM EDTA, centrifuged at 
200 g for 4 min, and pellet was snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. Genomic 
DNA was extracted from the cell pellets using a Blood and Tissue DNA extraction kit 
(QIAGEN) following the manufacturer’s directions. SNP karyotyping was performed using 
a Genome–Wide CytoScan HD Array (Affymetrix) covering 2.7 million markers and 
750,000 SNPs, and was analyzed using Chromosome Analysis Suite (ChAS, Affymetrix).
Cardiac differentiation of hiPSCs
hiPSCs (>p20) were split at 1:12 to 1:15 ratios using EDTA as above and grown for 3–4 
days at which time they reached ~75% confluence. Media was changed to CDM36, 
consisting of RPMI 1640 (10–040–CM, Corning), 500 µg ml−1 Oryza sativa–derived 
recombinant human albumin (Oryzogen Sciencell), and 213 µg ml−1 L–ascorbic acid 2–
phosphate (Sigma–Aldrich). Media was changed every other day (48 h). For days 0–2, 
media was supplemented with 6 µM CHIR99021 (MedChem Express)19, 20. On day 2, 
media was changed to CDM3 supplemented with 2 µM Wnt–C59 (Biorbyt). Media was

10 mM D–galactose (Sigma–Aldrich)21, 4 mM L–lactic acid, 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Life 
Technologies), 20 µg ml−1 insulin (Life technologies), 1 × chemically defined lipid 
concentrate (Life Technologies), and 200 ng ml−1 tri–iodo–L–thyronine (Sigma–Aldrich)22.
Immunofluorescence staining for cardiomyocyte markers
Cells at differentiation day 15 were dissociated using TrypLE Express for 10 min at 37 °C, 
triturated, centrifuged at 200 g for 4 min, plated onto Synthemax II–SC–coated (625 ng 
cm−2) coverslips in CDM3 and allowed to adhere for 3–5 days. Cells were then processed as 
above and stained with 1:200 monoclonal mouse IgG1 TNNT2 (13–11, Thermo Scientific, 
MA5-12960), 1:200 polyclonal rabbit IgG ACTN2 (α–actinin, H–300, Santa Cruz 
Biotechnology, sc-15336), 1:50 monoclonal rabbit IgG P4HB (Abcam, ab137110), 1:400 
polyclonal rabbit IgG VWF (Abcam, ab201336), 1:500 polyclonal rabbit IgG MKI67 (Ki67, 
Thermo Scientific, PA5-16785), and 1:200 monoclonal mouse γ–H2AX (Millipore, 
05-636). Cells were washed 4 times, for 10 min, with 1% BSA in DPBS–T and then 
incubated for 1 h at RT in the dark with 1:400 Alexa Fluor secondary antibodies (Life 
Technologies) diluted in 2% BSA. Cells were washed again as above and mounted with 
ProLong Diamond Antifade Mountant with DAPI (Life Technologies) onto Superfrost Plus 
(Thermo Scientific) slides and imaged with an LSM510Meta Confocal Microscope (Zeiss).
Flow cytometry cardiac differentiation efficiency
For assessment of cardiac differentiation efficiency, cells on day 15 of differentiation were 
dissociated with TrypLE Express for 5 min at 37 °C and transferred to flow cytometry tubes 
(BD Biosciences). Cells were then fixed with 4% PFA for 10 min, permeabilized with 0.1% 
saponin for 20 min, and stained using 1:50 mouse monoclonal IgG1 TNNT2-647 (13–11, 
BD Biosciences, 565744) or 1:5 mouse monoclonal IgG2b MYH14-PE (MF20, BD 
Biosciences, 564408) for 30 min at RT. These conditions were shown to stain negative on 
human skin fibroblasts. Isotype controls Alexa Fluor 647 mouse IgG1 κ (BD Biosciences, 
557714) and Alexa Fluor 488 Mouse IgG2b, κ (BD Biosciences, 555743) were used to 
establish gating. Cells were analyzed using a FACSAria II (BD Biosciences) with a 100 µM 
nozzle and FACSDiva software. Data were analyzed using FlowJo X (TreeStar).
Cardiomyocyte plating and doxorubicin treatment
Cells at differentiation day 20 were dissociated using TrypLE Express freshly supplemented 
with liberase TH (50:1) for 15 min at 37 °C, centrifuged at 300 g for 5 min, filtered through 
a 100 µM cell strainer (Partec CellTrics), counted for live and dead cells using acridine 
orange and propidium iodide (AO/PI) and a LUNA–FL Dual Fluorescence cell counter 
(Logos Biosystems) and plated onto Synthemax–II–coated coverslip chamber sides (Nunc) 
in 24–well cell culture (750,000 cells per well), 96–well black–sided (fluorescence) or 
white–sided (luminescence) plates (100,000 cells per well, all Greiner), or 24–well Seahorse

 plates (250,000 cells per well, Seahorse Bioscience) in CDM3 supplemented with 20% 
dislyzed FBS (Corning). Doxorubicin hydrochloride (HY–15142, MedChem Express) was 
resuspended to 10 mM in WFI water (Corning). For treatments on day 30 hiPSC-CMs, 
doxorubicin (0.01–10 µM) was diluted in RPMI 1640 no glucose without phenol red 
supplemented with 500 µg ml−1 recombinant human albumin (Sigma–Aldrich) and cells 
were treated for 24 h to 96 h. For dexrazoxane treatment, hiPSC-CMs were treated with 100 
mM of dexrazoxane HCl (HY–76201, MedChem Express) 12 h prior to doxorubicin 
administration and then a second concentration was co–administered with the doxorubicin 
concentrations. For N–acetyl–L–cysteine, hiPSC-CMs were co–treated with 1 mM N–
acetyl–L–cysteine (A9165, Sigma–Aldrich) with doxorubicin treatment.
Phase contrast imaging and contraction assays
Phase contrast images were captured using a Leica DMIR–LED microscope with a Leica 
DFC550 camera and Leica Application Suite 4.1 software. Contraction data were extracted 
using a Cellogy Pulse video microscope and image analysis platform57.
Plate–based cellular viability, caspase 3 and 7, H2O2, GSH and mitochondrial membrane 
potential assays
After doxorubicin treatment, PrestoBlue (Life Technologies), 10 µl was added directly to 
each well of the 96–well plates, incubated at 37 °C for 2 h and fluorescence was read using a 
Cytation 5 Cell Imaging Multi–Mode Reader (BioTek Instruments) with monochromators 
set to 560 nm excitation and 590 nm emission. CCK–8 (Dojindo), 10 µl was added directly 
to each well of the 96–well plates, incubated at 37 °C for 4 h and absorbance was read at 
450 nm. CellTiter–Glo 2.0 (Promega), 100 µl was added directly to each well of the 96–well 
plates, incubated at RT on an orbital shaker (Thermo) for 10 min and read using fiber–optic 
luminescence with an integration time of 0.25 sec. For all cell viability assays, 10 µM 
staurosporine was used as a positive control. Caspase 3/7–Glo, ROS–Glo H2O2, and GSH–
Glo (Promega) were performed following manufacturer’s instructions and read using fiber–
optic luminescence with an integration time of 1 sec. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 
(Clonetech) and ToxiLight (adenylate kinase) (Lonza) were performed following 
manufacturer’s instructions. JC–10 (Enzo Life Sciences) was diluted to 2 µM in RPMI 1640 
and stained at 37 °C for 30 min, cells were washed and read with monochromators set to 490 
nm excitation and 520 nm (green) or 590 nm (red) emission. 20 µM FCCP was used a 
positive control. Data were analyzed using Prism 6.0f (GraphPad) using standard 
concentration–response guidelines.
Flow cytometry–based apoptosis, reactive oxygen species, mitochondrial membrane 
potential, and DNA damage assays
After doxorubicin treatment, cells were dissociated with TrypLE Express and stained in 
suspension. For apoptosis detection, cells were stained with 7–AAD (7–aminoactinomycin 
D) and Annexin V (both BD Biosciences) following the manufacturer’s instructions. 6 µM 
of camptothecin (Sigma–Aldrich) was used as a positive control to set the flow cytometry 
gates. For DNA damage detection, cells were stained with Anti–phospho–histone γ–H2AX 
(Millipore) and propidium iodide (Life Technologies) following standard protocols58. For 
whole cell ROS detection, CellROX Green (Life Technologies) was used at a 1 µM

 concentration, incubating for 30 min, excluding dead cells using SYTOX Red and using 20 
µM menadione (Sigma–Aldrich) as a positive control. For mitochondrial superoxide 
detection, MitoSOX Red (Life Technologies) was used at a 5 µM concentration, incubating 
for 30 min, excluding dead cells using SYTOX Green and using 20 µM antimycin A 
(Sigma–Aldrich) as a positive control59. Cells were analyzed by flow cytometry on a BD 
Biosciences FACS Aria II using FACSDiva software. Data analysis was performed using 
FlowJo X (TreeStar).
RNA–seq gene expression analysis
hiPSC–CMs were treated with doxorubicin for 24 h. Cells were dissociated with TrypLE 
Express and Liberase TH, centrifuged, and cell pellets were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen 
and stored at −80 °C then shipped to Macrogen who performed RNA extraction, cDNA 
synthesis, library preparation and sequencing on a HiSeq 2000 (Illumina) at 40 million reads 
(20 million in each direction). The probe level data was preprocessed with the Robust 
Multiarray Analysis (RMA) algorithm60, quantile normalized61, and summarized to the gene 
level.
RNA–seq gene expression analysis and coding sequence variant calling
RNA–seq analyses were performed on the hiPSC–CMs from 6 patients (3 DOX without 
cardiotoxicity responses and 3 DOXTOX with cardiotoxicity responses), each treated with 0 
or 1 µM doxorubicin. Reads were mapped to human genome (hg19) using tophat2 (version 
v2.0.13)62, assembled into transcripts using cufflinks (version 2.2.1) and cuffmerge with 
known transcripts as guides63, and quantified using cuffdiff (version 2.2.1). Only transcripts 
mapped to unique genes were retained. The read–counts of transcripts were aggregated to 
the gene level by summation. Gene expression were then log2 transformed with pseudo–
count of 1, and quantile normalized61. Only known protein coding genes were retained for 
subsequent analysis. Gene variants calling from the RNA–seq data are performed using 
samtools (version 1.2) and bcftools (version 1.2)64 and annotated with Genome Analysis 
Toolkit (version v3.4–46)14. The mutation effects of the variants are predicted using 
snpEff65. The variant calling results are visualized and inspected by using the Integrative 
Genome Viewer66.
Independent component analysis (ICA)
ICA is an unsupervised machine learning method for solving the blind source separation 
problem67. Given a g×s matrix X for the log–transformed expression values of g genes in s 
samples, ICA estimates a g×m source matrix S for m independent gene modules, and an m× 
s matrix A of mixing coefficients of the m modules in the s samples, such that X≈S·A. ICA 
has been shown to identify more functionally coherent gene clusters than previous methods 
such as K–mean and PCA37, 68. We applied ICA to derive the statistically independent gene 
modules (pathways) in the doxorubicin drug treatment data. Gene ontology enrichment 
analysis was performed using Fisher’s exact test algorithm69. To compare the patient–
response study (RNA–seq analysis of DOX vs. DOXTOX) and the concentration–response 
study (microarray analysis of doxorubicin 0–10 µM), we projected patient–response data Y 
onto the ICA modules S derived from the concentration–response data X to obtain the 
estimated expression of these modules, i.e., AY = St · Y, where St is the transpose of S.

 Transcription factor activity inference
To identify the transcription factors involved in a biological process, we applied Fisher’s 
exact test to evaluate if the target genes of each transcription factor are significantly over–
represented in the up– or down–regulated genes. We defined the up–regulated, down–
regulated, and unchanged genes for each of the m gene modules as those with standard 
deviation–normalized expression values z ≥ q0.95, ≤ z ≥ q0.95, and −q < z < q0.95, where 
q0.95, is the 95% quantile of standard normal distribution. The transcription factor target 
gene database was compiled from literature reported regulatory relationships from low–
throughput experiments as well as ENCODE70 and additional ChIP–seq data retrieved from 
Gene Expression Omnibus71. Two–tailed Fisher’s exact tests were performed. For the 
transcriptional regulatory network visualization, we used a linear model per gene module to 
estimate the activity values of each TF in our transcription factor target gene database. The 
P–values of TF activities are obtained from Wald test of the estimated activities, and q–
values were then estimated from the P–values.
Estimation of gene expression changes associated with patient–specific doxorubicin 
toxicity responses
Body mass index (BMI) is known to affect doxorubicin dosing and responses. To reduce the 
effect from BMI, we required it to be in the range of 25 to 34 when selecting patients. In 
addition, we included BMI as a control variable in the linear model when estimating patient 
specific doxorubicin responses. Specifically, to extract the differential response between 
DOX and DOXTOX patients upon doxorubicin treatment, the following linear model for 
observed gene expression level xid for patient i (1–6) and doxorubicin concentrations d (0, 
1uM) is applied to each gene:
where bi and ti are the BMI and response type (DOX or DOXTOX), respectively, βb, βt, and 
βd are the effects of BMI, patient type, and doxorubicin treatment on the gene expression, 
whereas βbd and βtd are the interaction effects of BMI and doxorubicin treatment, and 
patient response type and doxorubicin treatment, respectively. We did not strictly control for 
age in patient selection, and there is a spurious inverse correlation between patient age and 
toxicity response in our dataset (R = −0.81, P–value = 0.052). However, as we found that 
including age as control variable did not change the major findings, we present the results 
based on the model that does not include age variable. In addition, age is not a known risk 
factor for doxorubicin cardiotoxicity. Despite these, it is possible that the identified patient 
specific drug responses and regulatory mechanisms could be partly due to unknown age 
differences between the patients.
Seahorse extracellular metabolic flux assay
hiPSC–CMs were plated at 250,000 cells per well in Synthemax–II–coated Seahorse 24–
well plates in CDM3M. The bioenergetics response of hiPSC–CMs was measured with the 
Seahorse Bioscience XF24 Flux Analyzer following directions in the XF Cell Mito Stress 
Test Kit User Guide. Media was aspirated and replaced with 525 µL assay medium

 (Seahorse Bioscience) and pre–equilibrated for 1 h at 37 °C. Baseline OCR measurements 
were performed followed by injection of 1 µM of oligomycin with three OCR 
measurements, then injection of 0.5 µM FCCP with three OCR measurements, and finally 
injection of 0.5 µM of rotenone and antimycin A followed by three OCR measurements. 
Four hiPSC lines were used for each sample group and contained 3 technical replicates. The 
0 µM well from each set of samples was stained with NucBlu Live Ready Probes reagent 
and number of cells per well were counted with a high–content imager (Biotek Cytation 5) 
to confirm plating homogeneity. (confirm dose is correct)
Mitochondrial copy number quantification
Cells were dissociated with TrypLE Express and pellets flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. 
Genomic DNA (gDNA) extraction was performed using DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit 
(QIAGEN), according to manufacturer’s instructions, with RNase treatment. Following 
determination of gDNA concentration using a UV–Vis spectrophotometer, all samples were 
adjusted to have equal starting concentrations. The mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) content of 
cells is expressed as a relative mtDNA : nuclear DNA (nDNA) ratio with the nDNA copy 
number per cell being considered constant and alteration of the ratio is attributed to changes 
in mtDNA content. Real–time amplification for a nuclear gene Succinate dehydrogenase 
complex, subunit A, flavoprotein variant (SDHA), and a mitochondrial gene NADH 
dehydrogenase subunit I (ND1) was performed using an ABI Prism 7000 Sequence 
Detection System.
Total oxidative phosphorylation protein analysis
Western blots were generated using standard Bio–Rad wet–blot protocols and antibodies for 
Total OXPHOS Antibody Cocktail (Abcam, ab110413), containing an optimized premixed 
cocktail 5 mAbs, one each against: CI subunit NDUFB8 (20 kDa, a subunit of NADH 
dehydrogenase, ab110242), CII subunit SDHB– (30 kDa, the iron–sulfur protein (IP) subunit 
of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), ab14714), CIII–subunit UQCRC2 (48 kDA, Core 
protein 2 – a component of the ubiquinol–cytochrome c reductase complex, ab14745), CIV 
subunit MTCO1 (40 kDa, a subunit of cytochrome c oxidase, ab14705), and CV ATP5A (55 
kDa, a subunit of ATP synthase, ab14748). α–tubilin (ab7291) was used as a loading 
control.
Calcium imaging
Dissociated hiPSC–CMs were reseeded in Matrigel–coated eight–well Lab Tek II coverglass 
chambers (Thermo Scientific Nunc) and were treated with 5 µM Fluo–4 AM (Life 
Technologies) and 0.02% Pluronic F–127 (Life Technologies) in Tyrode’s solution [140 mM 
NaCl, 5.4 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 10 mM glucose, 1.8 mM CaCl2, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4 
with NaOH at 25 °C] for 15 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed with Tyrode’s solution 
afterwards. Ca2+ imaging was conducted using a Zeiss LSM 510Meta confocal microscope 
(Carl Zeiss AG) with a 63× objective and analyzed using Zen imaging software. 
Spontaneous Ca2+ transients were obtained at 37 °C using a single–cell line scan mode.

of top genes significantly and differentially expressed between DOX and DOXTOX hiPSC–

doxorubicin (y–axis) vs. the differences at 0 µM of doxorubicin (x–axis) for selected 
biological processes, pathways, and transcription factors. A systematic deviation from the 
diagonal (dashed line) suggests patient–specific responses upon doxorubicin treatment. 
Significance of a given gene set (e.g., biological process, pathway or TF target gene set) is 
evaluated in two ways, namely mean differential expression and extreme differential 
expression. For mean differential expression (DE), we test if delta–delta–expression (y–x) 
has identical means for the member genes of the gene set against other genes using t–test. 
For extreme differential expression, we test if extreme delta–delta–expression values are 
enriched for member genes of the gene set using Fisher’s exact test. Significant: multi–test 
corrected P–value < 0.05.
