Americans Support Price Shopping
For Health Care, But Few Actually
Seek Out Price Information
ABSTRACT The growing awareness of the wide variation in health care
prices, increased availability of price data, and increased patient cost
sharing are expected to drive patients to shop for lower-cost medical
services. We conducted a nationally representative survey of 2,996
nonelderly US adults who had received medical care in the previous
twelve months to assess how frequently patients are price shopping for
care and the barriers they face in doing so. Only 13 percent of
respondents who had some out-of-pocket spending in their last health
care encounter had sought information about their expected spending
before receiving care, and just 3 percent had compared costs across
providers before receiving care. The low rates of price shopping do not
appear to be driven by opposition to the idea: The majority of
respondents believed that price shopping for care is important and did
not believe that higher-cost providers were of higher quality. Common
barriers to shopping included difficulty obtaining price information and
a desire not to disrupt existing provider relationships.
O
ut-of-pocket
spending
for
pa-
tients in the United States is ris-
ing rapidly,1 with a 41 percent in-
crease from 2010 to 2014.2 The
growth of high-deductible health
plans has been a key driver of this increase. Over
a third of Americans with employer-based insur-
ance are in such plans,3 and the most popular
bronze plans in the federal Marketplaces have an
average deductible of over $5,000.4
One assumption underlying the shift of costs
to patients is that greater financial responsibility
(“skin in the game”) will drive people to seek
lower-cost care. The potential for patients to save
money by identifying lower-cost providers is
clear given the large variation in prices across
providers—even within a single health plan
within a geographic area.5
To help patients identify lower-cost providers,
price transparency tools are now available
through health plans; employers (via a third-
party vendor such as Castlight); or public,
state-level sites such as NH HealthCost.6 Over
half of the states have passed laws or regulations
encouraging either payers or providers to dis-
close pricing information to patients.7 Despite
the increase in access to price transparency
tools, the degree to which Americans are actually
shopping for care is unknown. There is some
basis for skepticism that price shopping is com-
mon. Previous studies have demonstrated that
enrollment in high-deductible health plans de-
creases spending,8,9 but this appears to be driven
by decreases in utilization10 and not by the selec-
tion of lower-cost providers.11,12 Enrollment in
high-deductible plans is not associated with sub-
stantially greater price shopping.13 While users
of price transparency tools do use lower-price
laboratory and imaging facilities,14 overall rates
of tool use among those offered a price transpar-
ency tool are low.6,15–17 Furthermore, patients
generally express great satisfaction with their

 physicians18 and therefore may be unlikely to
want to switch physicians based on price.
To our knowledge, no national estimates have
been published in the peer-reviewed literature
on the extent to which Americans shop for health
care and their perspectives on shopping for care.
To measure rates of shopping for care and de-
scribe general attitudes on price shopping and
barriers to shopping for care, we conducted a
nationally representative survey of nonelderly
adults who had some out-of-pocket spending
for medical care in the past year.
Study Data And Methods
Study Sample We surveyed a nationally repre-
sentative sample of noninstitutionalized adults,
ages 18–64, drawn from the KnowledgePanel—
an online survey panel of adults—of the market
research firm GfK. This data source has been
used in numerous studies of topics such as rates
of tobacco use and care-seeking patterns.19–24
Panel members are recruited using address-
based sampling, and the raw sociodemographic
and geographic distribution of the members
fairly closely reflects that of the US adult popu-
lation. The panel is then weighted to ensure that
samples are representative of the US adult pop-
ulation. GfK includes households without Inter-
net access in the panel by providing members
who had no access with a free netbook computer
and Internet service.
From the GfK panel, we sampled respondents
who answered “Yes” to the question, “Please
think of the most recent time you received medi-
cal care. Did you receive care within the past 12
months?” We excluded adults ages sixty-five and
older who were insured by Medicare, because
85 percent of Medicare beneficiaries have sup-
plemental insurance that limits their cost shar-
ing and therefore reduces the financial pressure
they feel to shop forcare.25 Furthermore, because
prices in traditional Medicare do not vary within
a health care market, most efforts to increase
price transparency and price shopping focus
on the commercially insured population youn-
ger than age sixty-five, whose members face both
out-of-pocket spending and price variation.
Because of the importance of insurance and
patient cost-sharing design in price shopping,
we oversampled adults who were uninsured
and those in high-deductible health plans (with
deductibles exceeding $1,250 for individuals and
exceeding $2,500 for a family)26 to ensure a ro-
bust sample size for these populations. Our goal
was to have 3,000 respondents divided equally
among people who were uninsured, insured
with a high deductible, and insured without a
high deductible. We invited a random sample
of 30,863 GfK panel members to complete the
survey;
20,853
(67.6
percent)
invitees
re-
sponded.
Of
these
20,853
people,
16,562
(79.4 percent) had received care in the past
twelve months. We collected responses to our
survey from the members of this group until
we reached our prespecified number of respon-
dents. Details of the panel survey and response
rate are provided in the online Appendix.27
Among the 3,022 completed surveys, 23
(0.8 percent) were dropped because of concerns
about the validity of the responses; the respon-
dent answered fewer than one-third of the
questions or completed the survey in less than
one-quarter of the median response time. After
these exclusions, there were 2,996 final respon-
dents, of whom 826 were uninsured, 1,073 were
in a high-deductible plan, and 1,097 were in-
sured without a high deductible. Surveys were
completed in February and March of 2015.
Because the focus of price shopping is to save
money, we restricted our analysis of price-shop-
ping rates to the 1,904 respondents who said that
they had at least someout-of-pocket spending for
their care.
Instrument Development We drew on our
previous research on price shopping,8,11,14 other
survey instruments,28–32 and reviews by experts
in survey methodology to develop our survey
instrument. It was pilot-tested in January 2015
with eighty respondents, who were then inter-
viewed for follow-up cognitive testing. Survey
domains included general perceptions of price
shopping for health care, descriptions of the last
health care encounter, barriers to obtaining
price information, reasons one might not use
price to shop for a provider, type of insurance,
and general demographic characteristics. The
relevant questions are in the Appendix.27 None
of these questions allowed multiple responses.
Measures Of Price Shopping The concept
behind price shopping for health care is that
patients will seek information about their out-
of-pocket spending and compare that spending
across providers before choosing one. Opera-
tionalizing this concept into a single measure
of price shopping was not possible.We therefore
created several different measures that together
captured the concept of price shopping. All sur-
vey questions asked respondents to answer
based on the last time they had received care.
The measures were the following: price aware-
ness (did the respondent know his or her out-of-
pocket spending amount before receiving care),
active price searching (did the respondent ob-
tain price information before receiving care, by
contacting the doctor or health care provider
directly, visiting a health plan or price transpar-
ency website, or calling his or her health insur-

company),
considering
using
another
provider (did the respondent consider going to
a different health care provider), and making
price comparisons (did the respondent compare
his or her out-of-pocket spending amount across
different health care providers). Note that we did
not include as active searchers those who were
aware of their out-of-pocket spending amount
because they had learned what it would be at a
previous visit or because they simply looked at
their insurance card. Because patients with no
previous relationship with a provider might be
more likely to search for prices, we separately
examined shopping behavior for patients who
visited a provider for the first time.
Characteristics Of Survey Respondents
We categorized survey respondents by socio-
demographic characteristics, deductible amount
($0, $1–$500, $501–$1,250, $1,251–$2,500, or
$2,501 or more), level of coverage (single or
family plan), and type of care last received
(selected from a list).
Potential Barriers To Shopping For Care
In the survey we evaluated three sets of potential
barriers to shopping for care: Patients do not
price-shop because they do not support the idea,
people who would like to shop forcare are unable
to do so because they lack the time or informa-
tionneeded to identifya lower-cost provider,and
patients do not shop for care because of existing
relationships with a provider or the lack of alter-
natives.
Analyses In this article we report the results
of bivariate analyses and multivariate logistic
regression models with the binary outcome of
yes or no for the four price-shopping measures.
We eliminated variables that were collinear with
other variables. The model included respon-
dents’ reported deductible amount.We classified
the uninsured in the highest deductible category
because they pay the full costs of their care, and
we therefore expected that their price shopping
would be most consistent with those paying the
highest deductibles. We conducted a sensitivity
analysis with the uninsured in a separate catego-
ry (see Appendix Table S1).27 To adjust for
multiple comparisons, we calculated the false
discovery rate, and based on that calculation,
we considered only p values of less than 0.015
to be significant.33,34 All p values were two-tailed.
In all analyses, survey respondents were weight-
ed by probability of selection into the sample to
increase the national representativeness of our
results.
Limitations There were several limitations to
our analyses. First, the respondents to this sur-
vey might not be representative of a random
sample of people in the nation who received
health care, although our sample was weighted
to be similar to the US population (see Appendix
Table S2).27
Second, although we operationalized price
shopping using four different measures, each
had limitations. For example, patients might
not search for out-of-pocket spending amounts
because they are going to visit a known provider
or know that they always have the same copay-
ment and do not need to search for cost infor-
mation. Alternatively, a patient might not com-
pare prices because he or she obtained the price
at one provider, judged it to be sufficiently low,
and thus did not compare it to the prices at other
providers.
Third, some respondents might not accurately
remember the details about what they did before
their last episode of care, though we included
only respondents who had received care in
the past twelve months. In addition, because
many patients are unsure of their deductibles,33
there might be some misclassification on this
measure.
Fourth, because we focused on the adult pop-
ulation younger than age sixty-five, our results
might not be generalizable to older adults with
Medicare.
Finally, while the focus of this work was on
shopping for care based on price, we acknowl-
edge that price is only one consideration for
patients when they choose a provider.

 searched for out-of-pocket spending, 63 percent
had called their provider for information, 25 per-
cent reported using a website sponsored by their
health plan or employer or a website available to
the public, and 9 percent had called their health
plan directly (data not shown).
Theoretically, patients with a higher deduct-
ible and lower income would be more financially
motivated to price-shop for care.While there was
no clear trend in price shopping across strata of
income, respondents with a deductible were less
likely to be aware of their expected out-of-pocket
spending before they received care, compared to
those with no deductible (Exhibit 2). This differ-
ence may be driven by the fact those with a de-
ductible have to pay the full cost of care until the
deductible is met, and the out-of-pocket amount
they are responsible for under the deductible
might be unknown until a bill is received.
Non-Hispanic blacks (63 percent) were more

 likely to be aware of the price before receiving
care, compared to non-Hispanic whites (54 per-
cent) and Hispanics (49 percent).
Price shopping also varied by site of care.
Respondents were most likely to have compared
costs across providers for physical therapy
(24 percent) and for lab tests or imaging services
(11 percent) (Exhibit 3). The results of our mul-
tivariate models—which adjusted for age, sex,
household income, deductible, race/ethnicity,
care location, and whether this was the first time
seeking care—largely echoed our univariate re-
sults (see Appendix Table S3).27 Respondents
who received a procedure in an ambulatory sur-
gery center (odds ratio: 4.51; p < 0:01) were
most likely to have sought information on the
cost of care before receiving care. Those who
received physical therapy (OR: 24.5; p < 0:01)
or received a lab test or imaging service (OR:
6.36; p < 0:01) were most likely to have com-
pared costs across providers.
Potential Barriers To Price Shopping As
noted above, we examined three sets of potential
barriers to price shopping for care. One set is
patients’ attitudes about the concept: Patients
might believe that out-of-pocket spending is rel-
atively unimportant when choosing a provider,
that shopping for care is not a good idea, that
there is little price variation across providers, or
that choosing a lower-cost provider results in
lower-quality care. Our respondents did not gen-
erally hold these views.

 Seventy-one percent of respondents said that
out-of-pocket spending was either important or
very important to them when choosing a doctor,
and 72 percent of respondents agreed or strongly
agreed that having more patients compare the
cost, quality, or both of medical services when
they choose their doctors would be good for the
United States (Exhibit 4). Ninety-three percent
of respondents agreed or somewhat agreed that
prices vary greatly among providers, and only
22 percent said that it was likely or very likely
that
more expensive
providers had higher
quality.
The second set of potential barriers to price
shopping are a lack of time or knowledge about
where to get information on out-of-pocket
spending. Only 19 percent of respondents indi-
cated that time was the reason they did not con-
sider other providers, but 75 percent of respon-
dents said that they did not know of a resource
that would allow them to compare costs among
providers (data not shown). Fifty-three percent
of respondents reported that they would be likely
or very likely to use a website to shop for care if
one were made available to them.
The third set of potential barriers includes
having a previous relationship with a provider.
Among respondents who did not consider going
to another physician the last time they received
medical care, 77 percent reported that this was
because they had gone to their provider in the
past (data not shown). Respondents who re-
ported that their most recent use of medical care
was with a new provider were more likely to have
compared costs of care across providers before
receiving care, compared to respondents who
returned to a provider (8 percent versus 2 per-
cent) (Exhibit 3), but the differences were
modest.
A related barrier is a lack of alternatives.
Among the respondents who did not consider
other providers, 13 percent reported that they
did not do so because their health plan limited
their choice, and 2 percent reported that there
were no alternative providers in their communi-
ty(datanotshown).Fewrespondents(1 percent)
reported that they did not shop for care because
they required emergency care.
Discussion
In a nationwide survey of nonelderly adults, we
found that Americans are supportive of the con-
cept of price shopping, but most do not price-
shop themselves. Most respondents believed
that patients should shop for care and perceived
large differences in costs across providers. Con-
trary to concerns that patients equate lowercosts
with lower quality,35 the majority of respondents
felt that there was little relationship between
the two. However, relatively few respondents
actively sought information about out-of-pocket
spending amounts before receiving care, and
even fewer compared prices across providers.
This was true for respondents with insurance;
those with higher deductibles; and those seeking
care for the first time. Our findings that few
Americans are shopping for care and most do
not know where to get information on costs
are consistent with those in a recent report by

 Public Agenda36 and a recent Kaiser Health
Tracking Poll, in which most respondents re-
ported difficulty finding information on price.37
While the concept of price shopping is clear, it
was not possible to operationalize it into a single
measure. We used several different measures of
price shopping, and the overall rates we found
appear low even for populations that clearly
would benefit financially from price shopping.
However, we acknowledge that there is no con-
sensus on the “optimal” rate of price shopping in
health care. This research offers insights into
patients’ current perspectives and begins to an-
swer the questions of why people don’t price-
shop and what barriers stand in the way.
Policy Implications
The difference between Americans’ willingness
to price-shop for care and the rates at which they
do so is striking. Based on our findings, there
appear to be two key barriers that explain why
patients do not shop. First, people do not know
how to obtain price information. Despite the
many state and private interventions to improve
price transparency, few respondents in our study
were aware of external resources they could use
to obtain prices for different providers. Of the
respondents who searched for price informa-
tion, most obtained it by contacting their provid-
er or their health plan.
If price shopping is an important policy goal, it
will be necessary to increase the availability of
information on price and decrease the complex-
ity of accessing the information. Patients often
must know specific procedure or diagnosis codes
to obtain prices, and differentiating between
professional and facility fees makes the process
even more difficult.38,39 Other complex issues are
cost sharing and network design. There is evi-
dence that most Americans do not have basic
information on how their plan is structured,
such as their coinsurance responsibility and
whether or not a provider is in the plan net-
work.40 This confusion likely makes it more dif-
ficult to price-shop effectively.
Possibly the most important barrier to price
shopping is that many people either do not want

 to switch providers or are constrained by insur-
ance networks or lack of provider availability.
Collectively, these barriers highlight a discon-
nect between two policy trends in the United
States, each of which is built on a different as-
sumption. One trend is reflected in the growth of
deductibles and price transparency and is built
on thebelief thatin order to savemoney, patients
should price-shop for each health care service
(office visits, lab tests, imaging services, and
procedures) that can be obtained independently
across a variety of providers. The other trend is
reflected in the use of incentives to provide and
use coordinated care (such as what occurs in
patient-centered medical homes and account-
able care organizations), which is based on the
belief that patient outcomes are improved when
people receive coordinated care over time. Mod-
els that focus on coordination discourage price
shopping, as the implicit expectation is that the
vast majority of the care would be provided by a
single provider or health system. The conflicts
between these policy trends need to be resolved if
price shopping is to become an effective tool for
cost reduction.
In spite of the low rates of price shopping for
care in general, we found that shopping was
more common for some types of care. Not sur-
prisingly, respondents were most likely to have
sought cost information for higher-cost services
such as outpatient procedures. Physical therapy
care may be ideally suited to comparison shop-
ping because it is nonurgent and is typically
repeated several times, which allows people to
benefit from cost savings over multiple visits.
Conclusion
Increased publicity about widely varying prices
and steadily increasing rates of patient cost shar-
ing has emphasized the importance of price
shopping in health care. In a nationally repre-
sentative survey of nonelderly adults, we found
general support among the American public for
the idea of price shopping for care, but little
evidence that patients areshopping. Key barriers
include the availability and awareness of price
information and the desire to avoid switching
providers and disrupting existing relationships.
Our results emphasize that simply passing
price transparency laws or regulations (as over
half of states have done) appears insufficient
to facilitate price shopping. Price information
must be more accessible and comprehensible
to patients. However, our results show that even
if the information were more easily accessible,
patients’ preferences to maintain provider rela-
tionships and efforts to coordinate care would
limit overall rates of shopping. Efforts to encour-
age price shopping may need to be targeted to
selected clinical contexts that are suitable for
shopping. ▪
