Abstract
Background
Pharmacoepidemiological studies have long raised concerns on widespread use of benzo-
diazepines and benzodiazepine-related drugs (BZDs), in particular long-term use, among
adults and the elderly. In contrast, evidence pertaining to the rates of BZD use at younger
ages is still scarce, and the factors that influence BZD utilisation and shape the different pre-
scribing patterns in youths remain largely unexplored. We examined the prevalence rates,
relative changes in rates over time, and prescribing patterns for BZD dispensation in young
people aged 0–24 years in Sweden during the period January 1, 2006–December 31, 2013,
and explored demographic, clinical, pharmacological, and prescriber-related attributes of
BZD prescribing in this group.
Methods and findings
Through the linkage of 3 nationwide Swedish health and administrative registers, we col-
lected data on 17,500 children (0–11 years), 15,039 adolescents (12–17 years), and 85,200
young adults (18–24 years) with at least 1 dispensed prescription for a BZD during 2006–
2013, out of 3,726,818 Swedish inhabitants aged 0–24 years. Age-specific annual preva-
lence rates of BZD dispensations were adjusted for population growth, and relative changes
in rates were calculated between 2006 and 2013. We analysed how BZD dispensation var-
ied by sex, psychiatric morbidity and epilepsy, concurrent dispensation of psychotropic med-
ication, type of dispensed BZD, and type of healthcare provider prescribing the BZD.
Prescribing patterns were established in relation to duration (3 months, >3 to �6 months, or
>6 months), dosage (<0.5 defined daily dosage [DDD]/day, �0.5 to <1.5 DDD/day, or �1.5
DDD/day), and “user category” (“regular users” [�0.5 to <1.5 DDD/day for �1 year], “heavy

 users” [�1.5 DDD/day for �1 year], or otherwise “occasional users”). Multinomial regression
models were fitted to test associations between BZD prescribing patterns and individual
characteristics of study participants. Between 2006 and 2013, the prevalence rate of BZD
dispensation among individuals aged 0–24 years increased by 22% from 0.81 per 100
inhabitants to 0.99 per 100 inhabitants. This increase was mainly driven by a rise in the rate
among young adults (+20%), with more modest increases in children (+3%) and adoles-
cents (+7%). Within each age category, overall dispensation of BZD anxiolytics and clonaz-
epam decreased over time, while dispensation of BZD hypnotics/sedatives, including Z-
drugs, showed an increase between 2006 and 2013. Out of 117,739 study participants with
dispensed BZD prescriptions, 65% initiated BZD prescriptions outside of psychiatric ser-
vices (92% of children, 60% of adolescents, 60% of young adults), and 76% were dispensed
other psychotropic drugs concurrently with a BZD (46% of children, 80% of adolescents,
81% of young adults). Nearly 30% of the participants were prescribed a BZD for longer than
6 months (18% of children, 31% of adolescents, 31% of young adults). A high dose prescrip-
tion (�1.5 DDD/day) and heavy use were detected in 2.6% and 1.7% of the participants,
respectively. After controlling for potential confounding by demographic and clinical charac-
teristics, the characteristics age above 11 years at the first BZD dispensation, lifetime psy-
chiatric diagnosis or epilepsy, and concurrent dispensation of other psychotropic drugs
were found to be associated with higher odds of being prescribed a BZD for longer than 6
months, high dose prescription, and heavy use. Male sex was associated with a higher likeli-
hood of high dose prescription and heavy use, but not with being prescribed a BZD on a
long-term basis (> 6 months). The study limitations included lack of information on actual
consumption of the dispensed BZDs and unavailability of data on the indications for BZD
prescriptions.
Conclusions
The overall increase in prevalence rates of BZD dispensations during the study period and
the unexpectedly high proportion of individuals who were prescribed a BZD on a long-term
basis at a young age indicate a lack of congruence with international and national guide-
lines. These findings highlight the need for close monitoring of prescribing practices, particu-
larly in non-psychiatric settings, in order to build an evidence base for safe and efficient BZD
treatment in young persons.
Author summary
Why was this study done?
• Benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine-related drugs (BZDs) are among the most widely
used psychotropic medications in the world and have long raised public health concerns
due to the risk for their users of developing dependence and severe adverse effects, in
particular among long-term users.
• The prevalence rates and attributes of BZD use have been well described in adults and
the elderly.

 • In contrast, evidence regarding BZD prescribing for younger populations is scarce and

What did the researchers do and find?
• We linked nationwide Swedish health and administrative registers on 3,726,818 individ-
uals aged 0–24 years living in Sweden between 2006–2013, among whom 17,500 chil-
dren (0–11 years), 15,039 adolescents (12–17 years), and 85,200 young adults (18–24
years) were dispensed a BZD prescription at least once during that period.
• The prevalence rate of BZD dispensation has increased by 22% between 2006 and 2013,
and has increased particularly in young adults.
• For nearly 65% of all study participants with 1 or more dispensed BZD prescriptions,
the first prescription was issued outside specialised psychiatric services. Most first pre-
scriptions originated from primary care (41%) and non-psychiatric specialist settings
(24%) such as paediatrics and internal medicine.
• Over 75% of study participants were dispensed other psychotropic medication concur-
rently with a BZD, raising concerns about the potential risk of drug interactions.
• Almost 30% were prescribed a BZD for longer than 6 months, contradicting interna-
tional and national guidelines that advise against BZD use beyond 2–4 weeks for adults
and generally discourage prescribing BZDs for ages below 18 years.
What do these findings mean?
• There is a need for clinicians, particularly those working in non-psychiatric services, to
implement strategies to avoid potentially harmful patterns of prescribing BZDs to
young people.
• Young individuals who are prescribed BZDs should be closely monitored, in particular,
with respect to duration of BZD treatment and concurrent prescription of other psycho-
tropic drugs.
Introduction
Widespread use of benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine-related drugs (BZDs) has long raised
public health concerns, owing to the risks of developing tolerance, dependence, withdrawal
syndromes, and severe adverse effects, particularly among long-term users [1–3]. A recently
published perspective piece makes parallels between the contemporary epidemic of overpre-
scribing of opioids and that of BZDs, with the former phenomenon being well acknowledged
by clinicians and policymakers, while for the latter one a lesser effort is being made to address
today’s prescribing practices [4]. Current knowledge on BZD prescribing, incidence and prev-
alence rates, and patterns of use mainly rely on data on adults and the elderly, for whom BZDs
are often prescribed for managing anxiety symptoms and insomnia [1,3]. International and
national guidelines recommend using BZDs for no longer than 2–4 weeks since the risk–

 benefit ratio beyond that period is debatable [5–8]. Evidence pertaining to the corresponding
issues in individuals at younger ages is limited, not least due to BZDs not being recommended
as a pharmacological option for treatment of any psychiatric disorders in persons below 18
years of age [9–11]. Indeed, the only firmly established indications of BZDs in this age group
are the control of different types of seizures and the treatment of status epilepticus [12–15].
Studies on BZD prescribing in children and adolescents consistently report low annual preva-
lence rates (0.3%–0.5% in North America [16] and 0.2%–0.9% in Europe [17–20]), while the
results of time-trend analyses appear to vary between countries. Over the last 2 decades, BZD
prescription rates have increased in children and adolescents in various Western countries
[16,21,22], while remaining stable or decreasing in others [17,18,21]. Depending on how each
study defines the age boundaries for the category of young adults, BZD prescription rates are
reported to range between 1% and 5%, and to mainly increase over time [21,23,24]. Notewor-
thy is that recent European data on new BZD users show a low and decreasing incidence in the
age group below 18 years [25]. This, in light of stable or increasing prevalence rates, points
towards a risk for chronic BZD use in this population.
Despite being scarce, studies on paediatric BZD use raise a series of concerns, in particular
related to inappropriate prescriptions, concurrent use of psychotropic drugs, changes in the
characteristics of the prescribers towards a higher involvement of non-psychiatrists and pri-
mary care physicians, and long-term use [16–18,21,26–29]. Few studies have investigated the
patterns of BZD use among people below 18 years of age; existing studies used definitions of
long-term use ranging from over 1 month [30,31] to over 3 months of cumulative BZD pre-
scribing [17], and the proportion of long-term BZD users varied widely, from 3.3%–5.9%
[17,31] to 14.7% [30]. A higher likelihood of long-term use is reported for children and adoles-
cents with psychiatric disorders, epilepsy, and BZD prescriptions initiated by psychiatrists,
with less clear results on the role of sex [31]. Given the frequent “off-label” BZD prescribing
(i.e., outside of approved indication or age category [32]), and that the risk–benefit ratio of
BZD use has not yet been fully clarified for children and adolescents [33–35], it is important to
establish predictors and attributes of BZD prescribing patterns in these age groups to serve as
an evidence base for guiding clinicians in their prescribing practices.
To fill this important gap in the knowledge base, we aimed to explore the annual prevalence
rates of BZD dispensations and relative changes in rates over time among individuals aged
below 25 years during 2006–2013. Subsequently, we sought evidence on how BZD dispensa-
tions in children, adolescents, and young adults vary by individual characteristics (sex, psychi-
atric morbidity and epilepsy, and concurrent dispensation of psychotropic medication), type
of BZD drug, and type of healthcare provider prescribing the BZD. Furthermore, we aimed to
describe BZD prescribing patterns with regard to duration of prescription and prescribed dos-
age and to explore associations between different patterns and characteristics of the patients.
Methods
Data sources and register linkage
The study was set in a population-based cohort constructed through the record linkages of 3
Swedish registers with complete national coverage. The Swedish Prescribed Drug Register
(PDR) encompasses data on prescribed medications dispensed across all pharmacies in Swe-
den from July 2005 onwards, registered using Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification
System (ATC) codes, along with dosage, dispensed amount, dispensation date, and type of
healthcare provider prescribing the BZD [36]. The PDR does not include treatment indication
and medications administered in hospitals. The National Patient Register (NPR) comprises
data on clinical diagnoses, coded using the International Classification of Diseases (ICD),

 from inpatient care (1964 onwards) and specialist outpatient services (2001 onwards), with
complete (national) coverage since 1987 and 2001, respectively [37]. The register was validated
for an array of diagnoses, with a positive predictive value of 85%–95% overall and up to 97%
for psychiatric disorders [37–41]. The Total Population Register (TPR) contains demographic
characteristics of Swedish inhabitants from 1968 onwards [42]. The PDR and the NPR are
held by the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare, and the TPR is maintained by Sta-
tistics Sweden. The linkage was performed through the unique personal identification number
assigned to all Swedish citizens and residents [43]. The study was approved by the Regional
Ethical Review Board (2013/5:8) in Stockholm, Sweden. The requirement for informed con-
sent was waived because the study was register-based and the included individuals were not
identifiable at any time.
Study participants
The study participants comprised all individuals aged 0–24 years with at least 1 dispensed BZD
prescription between January 1, 2006, and December 31, 2013, according to the PDR. Sex and
birth year were collected from the TPR and linked to the data from the PDR. The birth year
was used to calculate age at the first and each consecutive BZD dispensation. The participants
were categorised into children (0–11 years), adolescents (12–17 years), and young adults (18–
24 years). For the analyses over the whole period 2006–2013, categorisation was based on age
at first BZD dispensation. For assessing BZD dispensations within each year (e.g., annual prev-
alence), the actual age of participants in the specific year was used.
Measures
BZD medications and prescribing patterns.
BZD medications were defined by ATC
codes for benzodiazepine derivatives in anxiolytics (N05BA), hypnotics/sedatives (N05CD),
and antiepileptics (N03AE), and for a group of benzodiazepine-related drugs in hypnotics/sed-
atives known as Z-drugs (N05CF), in the PDR.
For each BZD prescription, the date of dispensation and the dispensed amount (with the
defined daily dosage [DDD] as the measurement unit [44]) were also retrieved from the PDR.
BZD prescriptions that were dispensed in July–December 2005 were not extracted, to obtain
comparable, full-year data for estimating the annual prevalence rates of BZD dispensations in
2006–2013. An “individual treatment period” and an “average daily dosage” of BZD for each
treatment period were defined for every participant. A treatment period was defined as a
sequence of BZD dispensations where the gap between 2 consecutive dispensations (i.e.,
between the actual dispensation dates) did not exceed 6 months. The duration of the period
was estimated as the length of time between the first and the final BZD dispensation. As the
Ordinance on Pharmaceutical Benefits adopted by the Swedish Government allows a maxi-
mum 3-month medication supply per prescription [45], the duration of each individual period
was then extended by 91 days to ensure capturing the full length of BZD treatment. If there
was a gap extending beyond 6 months, the next dispensation was considered as the initiation
of a new treatment period. Thus, by definition, each participant could have multiple individual
treatment periods of different durations (see S1 Fig for details). Because all drug prescriptions
in Sweden are for 3 months as standard, the minimal length of a single treatment period was
set at 3 months. Furthermore, an average daily dosage of BZD for each individual treatment
period was calculated by dividing the total dispensed amount of BZD in a corresponding treat-
ment period (i.e., the cumulative DDDs dispensed within the corresponding period) by the
length of that period (see S1 Fig for details).

 Three variables for BZD prescribing patterns were constructed. Duration of prescription
was based on the length of an individual treatment period and was subdivided as 3 months
(reference category), >3 to �6 months, or >6 months. Prescribed dosage was based on an
average daily dosage of BZD calculated for the treatment period and was categorised into <0.5
DDD/day (reference category), �0.5 to <1.5 DDD/day, or �1.5 DDD/day. “User category”
was constructed to reflect the benchmarks introduced by the Swedish National Board of
Health and Welfare for evaluating quality and efficiency of Swedish healthcare [46]. The vari-
able combined information on the average daily dosage and duration of treatment period, and
categorised the individuals as “regular users” (�0.5 to <1.5 DDD/day for �1 year), “heavy
users” (�1.5 DDD/day for �1 year), or, otherwise, “occasional users” (reference category). If
multiple treatment periods were identified, the highest category of each prescribing pattern
was used for analysis (see S1 Fig for details).
Concurrent psychotropic medication, psychiatric diagnoses and epilepsy, and type of
healthcare provider prescribing the BZD.
Data on concurrent psychotropic medications, if
they were dispensed up to 6 months prior to or after the dispensation date of a BZD prescrip-
tion, were retrieved from the PDR from July 1, 2005, to June 30, 2014, to cover a 6-month
period for BZD prescriptions that were dispensed at the beginning of 2006 or the end of 2013.
Concurrent psychotropic drugs included antipsychotics, antidepressants, mood stabilisers,
psychostimulants, drugs used in addictive disorders, analgesics, opioids, non-BZD antiepilep-
tics, non-BZD anxiolytics, and non-BZD hypnotics/sedatives (see S1 Table).
The ICD-10 codes, introduced in 1997, and dates of diagnoses for psychiatric disorders and
epilepsy (see S2 Table) were retrieved from the NPR for the period between 1997 and 2013.
Two variables were constructed, separately for psychiatric disorders and epilepsy: diagnosed 6
months prior to or after BZD dispensation (for those who collected a BZD between January 1,
2006, and June 30, 2013, to allow a 6-month time window for diagnoses after dispensation)
and lifetime diagnosis (if diagnosed ever between 1997–2013).
Data on the healthcare provider category (primary care, psychiatric service, or specialised
care other than psychiatry) were retrieved from the PDR for the prescriber who issued the first
BZD prescription for each individual.
Statistical analyses
The study was performed in correspondence with a prespecified analysis plan (see S1 Text).
Annual prevalence of BZD dispensations was calculated separately for children, adolescents,
and young adults as the proportion of individuals who were dispensed a BZD at least once dur-
ing the year, for the years 2006 to 2013, out of the total number of inhabitants of the same age
category in Sweden in the corresponding year (as reported by Statistics Sweden [47]). Individ-
uals with multiple BZD dispensations within the same year were counted only once. The rates
are reported per 100 inhabitants to be interpreted as age-specific annual prevalence of BZD
dispensation in the general population of Sweden in 2006–2013.
Subsequently, the attributes of BZD dispensations (i.e., sex, concurrent dispensation of
psychotropic drugs, psychiatric diagnoses and epilepsy, type of BZD drug, and healthcare
provider category) were analysed among all individuals (0–24 years) with dispensed BZD
prescriptions and stratified by age categories. The results are reported in percentages to be
interpreted as the proportion with a certain attribute per 100 study participants. The analy-
ses were performed within each year (the denominator included individuals with at least 1
dispensed BZD prescription in a given year) and across the study period (the denominator
included all individuals with at least 1 dispensed BZD prescription between 2006 and
2013).

 To study changes over time in annual prevalence rates of BZD dispensations in Swedish
youths or in proportions of various attributes of BZD dispensations among the study partici-
pants, the relative change in measures in 2013 from those in 2006 (the referent value) was cal-
culated: The value estimated in 2006 was subtracted from that in 2013, and the result was
divided by the value in 2006. The relative change is reported as a percentage, with positive
quantities corresponding to increases in values over time, and negative ones corresponding to
decreases. Multinomial logistic regression models were fitted to obtain odds ratios and corre-
sponding 95% confidence intervals for associations of the prescribing patterns with age, sex,
lifetime psychiatric diagnoses and epilepsy, and concurrent dispensation of psychotropic
drugs. In the modelling strategy, variables were included in the multivariate analysis if they
were found significant in the univariate models or if they fulfilled the criteria for being con-
founders [48].
A series of sensitivity analyses were conducted by repeating the main analyses in a sub-pop-
ulation restricted to individuals without a lifetime diagnosis of epilepsy to capture the BZD
prescribing for indications other than seizures. In reporting, we followed the STROBE guide-
lines for cohort studies (see S1 Checklist). All statistical analyses were performed using SAS,
version 9.4 [49].
Results
Annual prevalence and relative changes over time in rates of BZD
dispensation
Out of 3,726,818 individuals aged 0–24 years living in Sweden during 2006–2013 (as reported
by Statistics Sweden [47]), 117,739 (3.16%) collected at least 1 BZD prescription before their
25th birthday, with prevalence rates ranging from 0.81 per 100 inhabitants in 2006 to 0.99 per
100 inhabitants in 2013, corresponding to a relative increase of 22.2%. Among the study partic-
ipants, at the time of the first BZD dispensation, 14.8% were children (aged 0–11 years, n =
17,500), 12.8% were adolescents (aged 12–17 years, n = 15,039), and 72.4% were young adults
(aged 18–24 years, n = 85,200). The total number of individuals collecting BZDs increased
steadily from 2006 to 2013, with sizeable difference between age groups (Fig 1). Throughout
the study, the annual prevalence of BZD dispensations in young adults was 5- to 8-fold higher
than that in children and adolescents, with the relative change in rate indicating a 20.1%
increase from 2006 (prevalence rate of 1.99 per 100 inhabitants) to 2013 (2.39 per 100 inhabi-
tants) for the young adult group. Prevalence rates remained considerably lower and more sta-
ble in children (in 2006: 0.28 per 100 inhabitants; in 2013: 0.29 per 100 inhabitants) and
adolescents (in 2006: 0.43 per 100 inhabitants; in 2013: 0.46 per 100 inhabitants), with a rela-
tive increase of 3.5% and 6.9%, respectively.
Characteristics of the study sample
Table 1 presents the distribution of demographic and clinical characteristics of the study sam-
ple—individuals aged 0–24 years with at least 1 dispensed BZD prescription between 2006 and
2013—for the total sample and within age categories. Among the individuals with dispensed
BZD prescriptions, the proportion of females was higher than that of males overall and among
adolescents and young adults, but lower in children. Three out of 4 individuals from the total
sample collected at least 1 additional class of psychotropic drugs within 6 months of the dis-
pensation of a BZD, and 24.7% of the study participants received 3 or more classes of concur-
rent medications. The proportions varied across ages, with less than 50% of children and over
80% of adolescents and young adults collecting other psychotropic drugs concomitantly with a

 BZD. Antidepressants, non-BZD anxiolytics, and non-BZD hypnotics/sedatives prevailed
among concurrent drugs in adolescents and young adults, while in children mood stabilisers
were collected most frequently.
Among individuals who collected a BZD up to June 30, 2013 (n = 111,182; 94.4% of the
study sample), 45.3% had a record of a psychiatric disorder diagnosed within 6 months of
BZD dispensation, with anxiety and depression being the most frequent diagnoses (20.3% and
20.1%, respectively). In total, over 11% of study participants were diagnosed with epilepsy
within 6-month proximity to BZD dispensation (Table 2). The results for adolescents and
young adults corroborated the ones seen in the total sample, while in children only 16.6% had
a psychiatric diagnosis, with disruptive behavioural disorders being the most frequent diagno-
ses (11.8%). The proportion of individuals diagnosed with epilepsy close to BZD dispensation
was highest in children (39.7%), followed by that in adolescents (22.7%) and young adults
(3.1%). In addition, we assessed lifetime diagnosis of psychiatric disorders and epilepsy using
data for all 117,739 study participants. As anticipated, the proportions of participants with life-
time diagnosis were higher than those with diagnosis within 6 months of BZD dispensation,
although the most common diagnoses remained unchanged in all age groups.

 Dispensation of BZD drugs and percentage changes over time
As presented in Table 3, throughout the study, BZD anxiolytics were collected by 57.8% of all
study participants dispensed a BZD, with marginal change between 2006 and 2013 (relative
decrease of 3.1%). Diazepam and oxazepam were the top BZD anxiolytics dispensed (32.5%
and 25.5%, respectively), showing reverse relative changes over time (relative decrease of
17.8% and relative increase of 41.3%, respectively). A similar proportion of study participants
collected BZD hypnotics/sedatives, including Z-drugs (60.9%; relative increase of 9.8%), with
zopiclone and zolpidem being dispensed most frequently (39.3% and 27.5%, respectively; rela-
tive increase of 36.4% and relative decrease of 24.5%, respectively). Over the study period, less
than 3% of study participants were dispensed clonazepam (relative decrease of 18.2%).
The abovementioned results differed between age groups (Table 3). Children were mainly
dispensed BZD anxiolytics (97.4%), but uncommonly dispensed BZD hypnotics/sedatives,
including Z-drugs (8.4%), and clonazepam (6.7%). Over the whole study period, diazepam was
the dominant BZD drug dispensed to children (95.5%). Adolescents prevailed over young
adults in collecting BZD anxiolytics (59.1% versus 49.4%) and clonazepam (3.8% versus 1.8%),
while BZD hypnotics/sedatives and Z-drugs were collected at higher rates among young adults
compared to among adolescents (71.7% versus 60.5%). Notwithstanding these differences,
within each age category overall dispensation of BZD anxiolytics and clonazepam decreased
over time, while dispensation of BZD hypnotics/sedatives, including Z-drugs, showed an
increase between 2006 and 2013.

 Healthcare provider categories
In the total sample of study participants dispensed a BZD, the first BZD prescription was most
commonly issued within non-psychiatric healthcare services (i.e., in primary care, 40.7%, or
specialised care other than psychiatry, 24.1%) (Table 4). The healthcare provider category in
which BZD prescriptions were initiated differed between age categories, although services out-
side of psychiatry prevailed across all ages. Only 8.1% of the first BZD prescriptions for chil-
dren and 40% of such prescriptions for adolescents and young adults were issued at a
psychiatric service. Regardless of the age category, the share of BZD prescriptions initiated in
psychiatric healthcare services appeared to decrease between 2006 and 2013 (Fig 2).
BZD prescribing patterns: Duration of prescription, prescribed dosage,
and user category
Throughout the study, 15.4% of the study participants dispensed a BZD were prescribed a
BZD for a period of >3 to �6 months, while 29.3% of the participants were prescribed a BZD
for longer than 6 months (Table 5). The results of univariate multinomial logistic regression

accounted for, the observed associations mostly decreased in strength, but all remained signifi-
cant. Furthermore, in the multivariate model, male sex was associated with a higher likelihood
of being prescribed a BZD for >3 to �6 months, but no association appeared for a duration of
prescription of longer than 6 months.
In addition, over 13% of the participants were prescribed a BZD with an average daily dos-
age of �0.5 to <1.5 DDD/day, while an average daily dosage of �1.5 DDD/day was observed
in 2.6% of individuals (see S3 Table). Regardless of the adjustment strategy, both categories of
prescribed dosage were associated with male sex, age at first BZD dispensation above 11 years,
a lifetime diagnosis of any psychiatric disorder, and concurrent dispensation of psychotropic

 medication. In the analysis that controlled for the effect of other covariates, lifetime history of
epilepsy had a significant association with a higher likelihood of being prescribed a BZD with
an average daily dosage of �1.5 DDD/day.
Furthermore, 6.1% of study participants fulfilled the criteria for being regular users, while
1.7% were considered heavy users (see S4 Table). In the multivariate model, male sex was asso-
ciated with higher odds of being a heavy user, but not a regular user. The odds of being a regu-
lar or heavy user increased with age at first dispensation, in the presence of lifetime psychiatric
disorders or epilepsy, and with concurrent dispensation of other psychotropic drugs.
Sensitivity analyses: BZD prescribing in sub-population without lifetime
diagnosis of epilepsy
Because treatment of seizures is the most common indication for BZDs in early life [9], we
restricted the analyses to study participants without lifetime diagnosis of epilepsy (n =
102,548). The results were largely unchanged (see S5–S8 Tables). The only exceptions were the
analyses of BZD prescribing patterns, where a sizeable reduction in the proportion of individu-
als in the highest category of each pattern was observed (see S9–S11 Tables). The differences,

adults with a BZD being prescribed on a long-term basis (> 6 months), high average daily dos-

analyses.
Discussion
This total population register-based study is among the first to systematically evaluate BZD
dispensation and its attributes among children, adolescents, and young adults at a nationwide
level. There were 5 principal findings. First, the study indicated a 22% increase in the preva-
lence rate of BZD dispensation between 2006 (0.81 per 100 inhabitants) and 2013 (0.99 per 100
inhabitants) in the population aged 0–24 years. This increase was mainly driven by a steady
rise in the rate among young adults, with more modest increases in children and adolescents.
Second, in all age categories of those with dispensed BZD prescriptions, a high proportion of
polypharmacy was observed, with almost half of children and over 80% of adolescents and
young adults having been dispensed other psychotropic drugs concomitantly with a BZD.
Third, off-label BZD prescription was common. This was particularly notable in adolescents,
among whom a substantial proportion were dispensed zopiclone and zolpidem—drugs that
are not approved for ages below 18 years, according to international and Swedish pharmaceu-
tical guidelines [5,50]—with a marked increase in dispensations of both drugs between 2006
and 2013 in this age group. Fourth, although the type of healthcare provider that initiated BZD
prescriptions varied between the age categories, the prescribers were mainly outside of special-
ised psychiatric services; approximately 65% of all prescriptions originated either in primary
care or non-psychiatric specialist services. Fifth, the most alarming results came from the anal-
yses of prescribing patterns, with an unexpectedly high proportion of individuals across all
ages being prescribed a BZD on a long-term basis—nearly every fifth child and every third
adolescent and young adult among those who received a BZD in 2006–2013 were prescribed
such medication for longer than 6 months. An elevated likelihood of long-term prescribing
was associated with age above 11 years at first BZD dispensation, lifetime diagnosis of any psy-
chiatric disorder or epilepsy, and concomitant dispensation of other psychotropic medication.
Sensitivity analyses provided additional evidence of long-term prescribing being a common
phenomenon, as the proportion of adolescents and young adults who were prescribed a BZD
for longer than 6 months remained large even when individuals with lifetime diagnosis of epi-
lepsy were excluded. Among children, although the proportion of those prescribed a BZD on a
long-term basis dropped by 80% after excluding those with lifetime diagnosis of epilepsy, BZD
prescribing for longer than 6 months remained present in nearly 4% of study participants in
this age group.
A general data scarcity on BZD prescribing in younger populations and differences in
methodological approaches between studies makes it difficult to find a direct comparison for
the present findings, which integrate a wide spectrum of attributes of BZD dispensation in
young people. Nonetheless, the rates of BZD dispensations in children, adolescents, and young
adults from our study corroborated the results of cross-national and national projects from
Europe and Canada [16,17,21], although they were higher than the rates reported for Norway
and Iceland [18,28]. Likewise, our findings of increasing rates over time were supported by
cross-European [21] and Canadian data [16], but differed from the decreasing rates seen
among children and adolescents in Norway, Ireland, and Denmark [17,18,26]. While inter-
preting the results on BZD dispensations in young populations, it is important to keep in
mind that there is no firmly established indication for BZD treatment in child and adolescent
psychiatry [9]—that is also true for Sweden [8,51,52]. In Swedish clinical guidelines for adults

 (i.e., age 18 years and above), the use of, for example, oxazepam is limited to alcohol with-
drawal and delirium tremens and as a second-line drug for temporary management of anxiety
symptoms, and zopiclone is a first-line drug for insomnia [8,51,53]. Additionally, guidelines
recommend diazepam and midazolam to be used for all ages for treatment of acute epilepsy,
while for status epilepticus, midazolam is listed for patients aged below 18 years and diazepam
for older individuals [51]. In relation to the abovementioned, our results on concomitant dis-
pensation of psychotropic drugs add to the concerns previously raised about a high prevalence
of psychotropic polypharmacy in children and adolescents [17,20,25,27,28,54]. The concerns
stem, particularly, from the evidence of enhanced adverse effects of BZDs, including central
nervous system depression and respiratory depression, in the presence of other central nervous
system depressants (e.g., antipsychotics, antidepressants, and non-BZD anxiolytics) or respira-
tory depressants (e.g., opioid analgesics) [20]. BZD concurrency with prescription opioids
(which in our study appeared in 13% of adolescents and 18% of young adults) gives another
cause for concern due to the increased risk of overdose and death among polydrug users
[55,56]. Given the restrictions posed by the guidelines on clinical utilisation of BZDs, our find-
ings of dispensed prescriptions for zopiclone and zolpidem in individuals aged below 18 years
are undoubtedly worrisome, but not uncommon, and corroborate the results from studies in
other countries with smaller sample sizes but comparable age categories [17,34]. In addition,
our finding of a large proportion of BZD prescriptions being initiated outside psychiatric ser-
vices corresponds to similar practices reported for patients aged 0–20 years in North American
studies and aged 0–17 years in Icelandic studies, although those studies cover periods only up
to 2010 [24,28,57]. The authors of those studies put forward the finding of the increase in visits
to non-psychiatrists that appears to coincide with an increase in prescribing of BZDs to young
individuals [24,28,57]. The issue was further addressed in a systematic review that demon-
strated a substantial diversity in knowledge, attitudes, and awareness about balancing the risks
and benefits of BZD treatment among primary care specialists [58]. It is worth mentioning
that, over the study period, the number of adolescents and young adults seeking psychiatric
care in Sweden increased significantly, with anxiety and depression being the top diagnoses
[59,60]. The same age groups also demonstrated a recent increase in receiving psychiatric diag-
noses in primary care services and specialised care other than psychiatry [59]. Additionally,
there has been a shift in the Swedish healthcare services towards expecting primary care to act
as a “first line of psychiatry” [61].
Our finding of an unexpectedly high proportion of individuals who were prescribed BZDs
for longer than 6 months deserves special attention. Although there is no consensus between
pharmacoepidemiological studies on the definition of long-term use [2], international clinical
guidelines strongly advise limiting BZD treatment to the shortest possible period of 2–4 weeks
due to side-effects and dependence and withdrawal concerns [1,3,6,7]. A recent systematic
review on long-term BZD use reported an average prevalence of 24% (95% CI 13% to 36%)
among BZD users of all ages, though the evidence mostly came from studies on adult and
elderly users, with the definition of long-term use varying from 1 month to over 12 months
[2]. As discussed above, the Swedish guidelines do not recommend BZDs for treatment of psy-
chiatric disorders among individuals aged below 18 years, and the maintenance therapy to pre-
vent seizures in patients with genuine epilepsy or other convulsive disorders cannot explain
the observed prescribing patterns. Given that in our study nearly 30% of the participants were
prescribed a BZD for longer than 6 months (even after excluding patients with lifetime epi-
lepsy diagnosis, who represented 11% of the study population), further examination is
required of potential predictors and mediators of this long-term BZD prescribing pattern. As
we assessed only the likelihood of such a pattern, it was not possible to infer causality, and,
therefore, no risk or protective factors could be clearly established in this study. However, the

 results pointed out several attributes of long-term BZD prescribing, including age of onset
older than 11 years, psychiatric comorbidities and epilepsy, and concomitant dispensation of
other psychotropic medications. These findings are consistent with previous research [2,31,62]
and highlight the need for thorough monitoring of BZD prescribing practices for drug–drug
interactions, adverse effects, and guideline adherence.
The study has several strengths, including the use of the official Swedish registers with com-
plete national coverage, extensive collection of clinical and demographic data, and timely and
routine updating. The robust and comprehensive nature of the present data minimises the
potential influence of sampling and reporting error and recall bias. The PDR covers all dis-
pensed drugs regardless of reimbursement status and service provider characteristics, which
makes our data representative of the prescribing practices across all healthcare levels in Swe-
den. In addition, the use of population-based registers ensures generalisability of the results at
the national level. Our study has, however, some limitations. First, the PDR does not contain
data on the indications for prescriptions, which may have affected our ability to fully analyse a
relation between comorbid diagnoses and BZD dispensations among the study participants. In
addition, we were unable to retrieve data on disorders diagnosed at primary care services,
which could possibly have resulted in an underestimation of the proportion of individuals
with comorbidity if they were diagnosed outside of hospitals and specialised care services. Sec-
ond, we lacked data on the diagnosis of febrile convulsions (ICD-10 code: R56.0) in the NPR.
Febrile convulsions are rather common below 6 years of age, and such data, if available, might
have given an additional insight into the associations between clinical diagnoses and BZD dis-
pensations, particularly among young children. Third, the data collection was limited to the
diagnoses coded with the ICD 10th revision (i.e., starting from 1997). This may have led to
missing diagnoses of psychiatric disorders or epilepsy in people born between 1982 and 1997 if
these diagnoses were recorded in the NPR before 1997 and were not mentioned again later.
Fourth, although the initial analyses included 3 types of BZD prescribing patterns, only the
duration of prescription was discussed as a principal finding. It was difficult to draw conclu-
sions about the other 2 patterns as many BZD substances have several indications and, hence,
different dosages may be recommended for different conditions. In the absence of information
on the exact indication, we wanted to avoid misinterpreting the patterns of prescribed dosage
and user category, and, therefore, the results reported on these patterns should be interpreted
as suggestive. Fifth, our analyses rest on dispensation data, and, hence, we cannot be certain
that the medication was used in proximity to the date of dispensation and by the person it had
been prescribed to. However, it is unlikely that the proportion of individuals who collected but
did not use BZDs varied across the study period [25]. Lastly, the PDR only covers the period
starting July 2005, making it impossible to analyse the rates and patterns of BZD prescriptions
dispensed prior to initiation of the register.
Notwithstanding the limitations, to our knowledge, this is the first study to explore BZD
prescribing patterns from different perspectives, namely duration and drug dosage, and to
identify individual characteristics that are associated with different prescribing patterns in
young people. Our study delineates the directions for further research since less consistency
still exists in relation to other potential attributes of BZD prescribing, in particular long-term
prescribing, including sex, pharmacological features of BZD substances, concurrent prescrip-
tion of distinct BZD classes, and combination of BZD treatment with certain modalities of psy-
chotherapy. Further work is needed to get insight on the underlying mechanisms and risk and
protective factors that shape the patterns of BZD prescription and use among youths. Our
findings have clear implications across a range of clinical settings as well as for public policy.
The results highlighted a need to devise and implement strategies to avoid potentially harmful
patterns of prescribing BZDs to young people. This can only be achieved by involving primary

 care—the source of the majority of BZD prescriptions—but also other categories of prescrib-
ers, including but not limited to specialised care in paediatrics, internal medicine, and psychia-
try. Prescribing practices need to be addressed using education, feedback, and peer support.
For patients with problematic use, the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence
guidelines recommend using stepped care models, where patients are given the least intrusive
recommended treatment [63]. Furthermore, given the increased availability of addictive drugs
via the internet, reductions in harmful prescribing need to be coordinated with availability pol-
icies involving, for example, customs and policing.
Conclusions
The annual prevalence rate of BZD dispensation in the Swedish population aged 0–24 years
increased substantially between 2006 and 2013. This increase was mainly driven by a steady
rise in the rate of BZD dispensation to young adults, accompanied by an increasing proportion
of off-label prescriptions. Polypharmacy was the norm rather than the exception, pointing to
the potential risk of drug interactions. Contradicting clinical guidelines, almost 30% of the
study participants were prescribed BZDs on a long-term (>6 months) basis. During the study
period, growing shares of prescriptions to individuals in all age categories were initiated in pri-
mary care or non-psychiatric specialty settings. It is critical to improve prescribing practices
through close monitoring of BZD utilisation in young people, strengthening the adherence to
BZD prescribing guidelines among primary care practitioners and other non-psychiatric spe-
cialists, and improving communication between non-specialised care and specialised psychiat-
ric services.
