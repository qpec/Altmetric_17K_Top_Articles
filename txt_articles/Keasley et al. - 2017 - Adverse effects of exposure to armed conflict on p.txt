AbstrAct
Introduction Exposure to armed conflict has manifold 
implications for both military and civilian populations. 
Prenatal stress has detrimental effects on both obstetric 
outcomes, fetal development and the development of an 
individual later in life. As well as causing stress to the 
mother, armed conflicts can decimate local infrastructures 
making it increasingly difficult to access antenatal and 
general healthcare. The present review is particularly 
salient in light of the many ongoing current conflicts. It 
examines the impacts of exposure to armed conflicts on 
the pregnancy outcomes.
Methods A thorough literature search was carried out 
on three databases using MeSH and truncation terms. 
13 studies were included in the final analysis relating to 
mothers exposed to armed conflicts since 1990.
results The studies include data from 1 172 151 
patients: mothers from Libya, Bosnia, Herzegovina, Israel, 
Palestine, Kosovo, Yugoslavia, Nepal, Somalia, Iraq, Kuwait 
and Afghanistan. There is evidence of an increased risk 
of mothers giving birth to babies of low birth weight as 
reported in nine included studies. All have a degree of 
bias, with four at lower and five at higher risk of bias, 
either not adjusting for confounders or not employing 
robust measures of exposure to conflict. Further evidence 
suggested an increase in the incidence of miscarriage, 
stillbirth, prematurity, congenital abnormalities, miscarriage 
and premature rupture of membranes among mothers 
exposed to armed conflict.
conclusion Despite the varying degrees of bias which 
must be considered for the available evidence, the data 
with the lowest risk of bias suggest a relationship between 
exposure to armed conflict and low birth weight. In light 
of the current level of displacement experienced by such 
populations, the identification of pregnancies at risk could 
improve the efficacy of antenatal care. Clinicians should 
consider additional ultrasound scanning where appropriate 
to monitor for restricted growth in such pregnancies.
IntroductIon
As of June 2017, 16 peacekeeping operations 
are being led by the United Nations (UN) 
across the world, working with countries torn 
by war and conflict.1 For those exposed to 
armed conflict, the implications are serious 
and wide reaching.2 Increasingly over recent 
decades, civilians have been caught in the 
crossfire and have had to endure persistent 
threats of bombing, gunfire and attack by 
chemical and biological weapons.3 These 
pressures force many people to leave their 
homes and seek refuge in other countries.4

Key questions
What is already known about this topic?
 
► Civilians exposed to armed conflict are subject to 
persistent threats of bombing, and both biological 
and chemical weapons. Increasingly over recent 
years, it is these civilians who have been most 
adversely effected by wars, impacting both physical 
and mental health.
 
► Armed conflicts reduce healthcare provision 
through the destruction of infrastructure, food 
and water supplies and sanitation systems. This 
decreases the availability of antenatal and perinatal 
care for expectant mothers.
 
► Adverse outcomes in pregnancy are manifold. 
While pregnancy outcomes such as premature 
birth, stillbirths and low birth weight have been 
documented in individual studies, no systematic 
reviews have been conducted on this subject.
What are the new findings?
 
► This review included 13 studies. While the studies 
present evidence with varying degrees of bias, all 
studies measuring birth weight found a significant 
relationship between maternal exposure to armed 
conflict and increased rates of low birth weight.
 
► There was limited evidence suggesting significant 
positive relationships between armed conflict and 
miscarriage, stillbirth and prematurity.
 
► There was less evidence across the other studies 
investigating relationships between exposure 
to armed conflict and other adverse pregnancy 
outcomes such as rates of congenital abnormalities.
recommendations for policy
 
► Given that mothers exposed to armed conflict 
are at a higher risk of giving birth to babies of 
low birth weight, clinicians must adjust care 
accordingly,that is, increase the frequency of 
ultrasound scans to track the growth of the baby 
and be prepared to intervene if required.

The changing landscape of war has also meant that now 
>90% of war casualties are civilians compared with only 
5% in World War I.5 In addition, women and children are 
particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of conflict.6 
Long-term health effects of exposure to armed conflict 
have been documented extensively, both in military and 
civilian populations; in particular, mental health condi-
tions such as post-traumatic stress disorder7 are highly 
prevalent. The short-term and medium-term health 
consequences of exposure to armed conflict are also 
manifold. Hospitals are often targets of attacks, resulting 
in significantly reduced healthcare provisions for civil-
ians.8 Armed conflict also causes disruptions in food 
supplies, water supplies and sanitation systems, the results 
of which all increase the risk of communicable diseases.9 
Furthermore, the indirect impacts of war can have long-
lasting detrimental effects on countries. Health services, 
for instance, are often severely interrupted by the 
destruction of infrastructure and management systems.10 
The many challenges for rebuilding these services mean 
that health provision can be disrupted for years after the 
cease of conflict.11 12
This systematic review focuses on the effects of expo-
sure to armed conflict on pregnant women, for whom 
conflict can mean a disruption to antenatal care, a 
decreased number of trained birthing attendants avail-
able at delivery and increased maternal stress (shown 
to raise levels of maternal cortisol and associated with 
long-term adverse consequences for the child).13 Armed 
conflict can also result in violence against women14–16 
and reduced provision of emergency care.17 This review 
examines both armed conflicts in which women were 
subjected to acute stressful events (such as explosions and 
other severe life-threatening events) as well as chronic 
stressful events of war (such as fleeing conflict and 
disruptions to food and medical supplies). It investigates 
the extent to which stresses associated with exposure to 
armed conflicts affect the incidence of adverse outcomes 
in pregnancy, including premature birth, stillbirths and 
low birth weight. Finally, the review considers both imme-
diate consequences, affecting pregnancies at the time of 
exposure, as well as longer-term consequences, affecting 
women years after exposure.
The present review is particularly salient in light of 
the many ongoing current conflicts. Syria, in particular, 
which has featured heavily in global news, has seen large 
numbers of people forced to flee their homes, resulting 
in 1 177 914 new asylum applications to European coun-
tries between April 2011 and September 2016.4 It is thus 
crucial to fully understand the implications of exposure 
to armed conflicts on pregnancy to provide the most 
appropriate level of care to these women.
MetHods
Three databases were searched: MEDLINE, Web of 
Science and Embase. The search terms are outlined in 
figure 1.
Studies were assessed for the following criteria: inclu-
sion criteria: English language, human studies, studies 
after 1990 (and related to armed conflicts starting after 
1990), include more than five patients, quantitative data 
and peer-reviewed studies with statistical analysis. Exclu-
sion criteria: military personnel, editorials and letters. The 
search terms were refined following consultations with a 
clinical evidence specialist.
The final search was conducted on 13 October 2016. 
In addition, the ancestry method was employed to ensure 
completeness, that is, bibliographies of relevant studies 
were screened to identify any further studies. No addi-
tional articles were identified. A preliminary grey litera-
ture search was conducted but no relevant studies were 
identified. Following this search, the authors agreed only 
to include peer-reviewed, published papers.
The studies were independently screened by two 
authors, rejecting studies for which the titles and 
abstracts did not meet the inclusion criteria or met the 
exclusion criteria. The remaining 54 studies were also 
independently assessed for eligibility; if they did not meet 
the criteria for inclusion, they were documented in a 
table, accompanied by the reasoning (see online supple-
mentary appendix x). In total, there were disagreements 
about the inclusion of six studies (11.1%). These discrep-
ancies were discussed until agreement was reached for 
all. The screening process is detailed in the Preferred 
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Anal-
yses (PRISMA) flow diagram (figure 2).
Following this, the quality of the studies was assessed 
using checklists from the Scottish Intercollegiate Guide-
lines Network (SIGN) 50. SIGN was formed in 1993, with 
the aim of ‘reducing variation in practice and outcome, 
through the development and dissemination of clinical 
guidelines’.18 SIGN was chosen over other checklists such 
as PRISMA and Strengthening the Reporting of Obser-
vational Studies in Epidemiology because after discus-
sion it was deemed the most appropriate for the review

question.19 No other system was regarded more appro-
priate for assessing the quality of studies such as inter-
rupted time series. The studies were given two scores: a 
level of evidence score and a methodology checklist score. 
SIGN 50 develops ‘evidence-based clinical practice guide-
lines’ for Scotland.20 The checklists provide researchers 
with the tools to grade the quality of evidence in studies 
across the spectrum of study designs. The basis of the 
checklists is to detect the risk of bias in studies and to 
rate the evidence on a scale. The level of evidence score 
ranges from 1++ (high-quality meta-analyses, systematic 
reviews of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or RCTs 
with a very low risk of bias) to 4 (expert opinion). All 
of the studies included were either rated as 2+ (well-con-
ducted case–control or cohort studies with a low risk of 
confounding or bias as moderate probability that the 
relationship was casual) or 2– (case–control or cohort 
studies with a high risk of confounding or bias and a 
significant risk that the relationship is not causal). The 
methodology checklist score is more rudimentary. The 
checklists differ for each study design, but the scoring 
system is consistent among checklists. The studies are 
deemed to be high quality (2+), acceptable (1+) or unac-
ceptable (0). While the aim of the checklists is to provide 
a systematic method for appraising evidence, the check-
lists are not objective and ultimately reflect researchers’ 
opinions about the quality of evidence. SIGN 50 does not 
provide appraisal tools for cross-sectional studies or inter-
rupted time series. As such, the decision was made to use 
the cohort study checklists to screen for bias, in line with 
previous systematic reviews.21
Data were extracted from 18 studies. Of these, five 
were rejected from the qualitative synthesis on grounds 
of their insufficient quality being graded with both a 
2– on the level of evidence scale and a 0 (unacceptable) 
on the methodology checklist scale. The data extracted 
from the studies were recorded in a comprehensive data 
extraction table and later condensed into the final results 
tables (see  online supplementary appendix tables 1, 2, 
3).
definitions
This study defined armed conflicts in broad terms, in line 
with the International Committee of the Red Cross and 
international humanitarian law to include both interna-
tional armed conflicts (involving two or more opposing 
states) and non-international armed conflicts (between 
governmental forces and non-governmental armed 
groups).22 This study considered armed conflict to involve 
exposures to physical, biological and chemical warfare. 
The study did not include one-off acute life-threatening 
events such as the attack on the World Trade Center.
Adverse pregnancy outcomes were also defined in 
broad terms, with individual study outcomes detailed 
in the results tables. The outcomes measured in the 
review included preterm labour, post-term labour, low 
birth weight, stillbirth, spontaneous abortion (miscar-
riage), small for gestational age, premature rupture 
of membranes, early neonatal mortality and perinatal 
mortality and maternal mortality.
Due to the heterogeneity of study designs, it was 
deemed inappropriate to perform a meta-analysis on the 
included studies; therefore, the results are synthesised in 
a narrative analysis.
results
Thirteen studies are included in the analysis. Five further 
studies were rejected on grounds of a high risk of bias as 
a result of methodological design.5 23–26 The studies relate 
to mothers from 12 countries affected by armed conflict; 2 
studies relating to participants from either Iraq or Kuwait 
during the 1990–1991 Gulf war,27 28 1 study relating to 
Libya,29 4 relating to Bosnia and Herzegovina,30–33 3 
relating to Israel and Palestine since 2000,34–36 1relating 
to Kosovo and Yugoslavia37and 1 relating to Nepal.38 
There was also one study relating to refugees settling 
in Norway; these women were from Somalia, Kosovo, 
Iraq and Afghanistan.39 There were four different study 
designs: two retrospective cross-sectional studies,27 29 one 
prospective cohort study,39 three retrospective cohort 
studies34–36 and seven interrupted time series.28–33 38 In 
total, the studies include data from 1 172 151 partici-
pants. However, the three studies with the most partic-
ipants,30–32 accounting for 1 127 614 participants, are 
also those with some of the weakest ‘level of evidence’ 
scores (with SIGN 50 scores of 2– and 1+ on the method-
ology checklist). The studies with the strongest level of 
evidence scores and a SIGN 50 grade of 2+ analyse data 
from 29 148 participants.

and non-significant data from the studies. If p values or OR

values relating to the outcomes were given in the studies, 
they have been included in the tables. The ‘measure of 
exposure/length of exposure’ column relates to how 
long the population was exposed to specific aspects of 
armed conflict and outlines the specific exposures that 
the authors cite as constituting war stressors. This infor-
mation was not available for every study.
low birth weight
Four studies focus primarily on low birth weight30 32 32 35 
and a further five studies measure it as an outcome.27–29 31 39 
All studies indicate a significant relationship between 
exposure to armed conflict and a detrimental effect 
on birth weight, four of which have a low risk of bias as 
indicated by their SIGN score; Arnetz et al27 (p=0.017, 
OR 3.00), Mansour et al35 (p<0.05), Maric et al37 (p<0.001) 
and Bakken et al39 (OR 3.97). Studies evaluated this rela-
tionship in three ways. (1) The OR of a woman giving 
birth to a low birthweight child if exposed to specific 
chemicals was calculated compared with a control group. 
(2) The rate of low birthweight babies during a war 
period compared with the prewar/postwar rates. (3) The 
percentage increase risk of having a low birth weight baby 
is calculated by examining the intensity of conflict in a 
mother’s place of residence. Interestingly, the only study 
to examine the trimester of exposure noted no signifi-
cant relationship between the trimester of stress expo-
sure and birth weight in infants born during the period.37 
In comparison to the other studies, this study had a low 
risk of bias (see online supplementary appendix table 1). 
stillbirth
Stillbirth was measured in five studies.27 28 31 33 38 Of these, 
only one demonstrated a significant increase in the rate 
of stillbirth (p<0.01); this was shown in relation to contact 
with specific chemical exposures in the 1990–1991 Gulf 
War such as smoke from oil well fires, exhaust fumes 
from kerosene heaters and generators, diesel fumes, 
mustard gas and food contaminated with smoke, oil or 
other chemicals.27 This study was among those with the 
lowest risk of bias. Three studies, two with higher risks of 
bias and another with a low risk of bias, showed no signifi-
cant difference in the rates of stillbirth when considering 
exposure to armed conflict.28 31 38 The Pavlinac et al study 
even showed significant decreases in the overall rates 
of stillbirth among all singleton births.33 This study also 
demonstrates that there was a significant increase in still-
births among mothers who had preterm births (p<0.001)
(see online supplementary appendix table 2).
Prematurity
Prematurity was measured in eight studies. Four studies 
demonstrated a statistically significant increase in prema-
ture births.27 29 31 34 Of these, the Arnetz et al27 and Keren 
et al34 studies have lower risks of bias than the Skokic et 
al31 and Bodalal et al29 studies. Arnetz et al measure expo-
sures to specific chemicals and report increases in the 
rates of prematurity. In contrast, one study with a low risk 
of bias compared with the other included studies found 
an increase in post-term births in Somalian women39 
exposed to armed conflict and another study showed a 
significant decrease in the number of premature deliv-
eries during the war.33 However, Pavlinac et al33 found 
that within the population of premature babies both still-
birth and early neonatal mortality rates increased during 
the period of armed conflict. The other studies found 
no such significant relationship between armed conflict 
and prematurity28 37 (see online supplementary appendix 
table 2).
other
Other adverse pregnancy outcomes were addressed to a 
lesser extent. Three studies discuss congenital abnormali-
ties: two studies, only one of which had a relatively low risk 
of bias,27 found significant increases (either in specific 
types of congenital abnormalities or rates in mothers 
exposed to diesel fumes)27 28 while a third study found no 
significant difference.37 Two other high-quality articles by 
Valente and Wainstock et al considered rates of miscar-
riage.36 38 Wainstock et al found a significant increase, 
and while the Valente study found a positive correlation 
between exposure to armed conflict and miscarriage, this 
finding was not significant. These results did not show a 
simple dose relationship.36 Wainstock et al, for instance, 
found that mothers with both the highest and lowest 
exposure rates during pregnancy in the sample were at 
the highest risk of miscarriage. In the same study, mothers 
with the highest rates of exposure preconception were at 
greatest risk of miscarriage in relation to those mothers 
with lower grades of preconception exposure. In addi-
tion, premature rupture of amniotic membranes was 
mentioned in two studies, both with lower risks of bias; 
one found a significant increase during the war years and 
another found no significant differences in the prewar 
/war period rates.34 37 Two studies with higher risks of bias 
also examined early and perinatal mortality.32 33 These 
both relate to the armed conflict in Bosnia. The studies 
found different results. Pavlinac33 found that, overall, 
early neonatal deaths decrease significantly both during 
and after the war. However, in contrast, when limiting the 
analysis to early neonatal deaths of only premature births 
during the armed conflict, there was a significant increase 
in the early neonatal mortality rate. Skokic32 found 
a significant increase in both neonatal and perinatal 
mortality during the period of armed conflict (p<0.001, 
<0.05). Three additional studies examine other complica-
tions including meconium-stained liquor, pre-eclampsia, 
maternal mortality, placental abruption, placenta previa, 
perineal rupture, postpartum bleeding >500 mL, umbil-
ical cord complications, neonatal jaundice, rhesus 
incompatibility, breech birth, shoulder dystocia, fetal 
asphyxia and hydropic newborns.31 33 37 39 Of these, only 
meconium-stained liquor was found to be significantly 
increased—this was within the population of Somalian 
mothers who sought asylum in Norway and gave birth 
outside Somalia.39 Such a significance was not found in 
 on 3 June 2019 by guest. Protected by copyright.

the other refugee populations. Skokic et al observed that 
maternal mortality rates were increased during periods 
of armed conflict (p<0.001).31 There was a higher risk 
of bias in this study. Maric et al, in contrast, reported a 
significant decrease in the rates of pre-eclampsia during 
the armed conflict (OR 0.592, 95% CI 0.407 to 0.863).37 
This study had a lower risk of bias (see supplementary 
appendix table 3).
confounders
Many different confounders were measured in the studies 
including smoking status, newborn sex, income, health 
insurance coverage, education, employment, ethnicity, 
maternal age, parity, gravidity, mode of conception, 
previous stillbirths/caesarean sections, pre-gravid health 
conditions, time spent in country of refuge, marital status 
and district of residence, anaemia and obstetric history. 
Taking Wainstock et al as an example, many studies show 
that confounders are significantly related to pregnancy 
outcomes. For instance, there are many indicators signif-
icantly related to miscarriage rates in the sample popu-
lation.36 These include maternal age >35 (p=0.001), 
unmarried women (p=0.004) and having had four or 
more pregnancies (p≤0.001). Women with a history of 
two or more abortions were also at a greater risk, though 
this only reached borderline significance (p=0.061). 
Three studies did not measure confounders; however, all 
of these studies had very large sample sizes.28–30 Skokic 
et al also found statistical significance between low birth 
weight and number of antenatal visits.32
Only one study examined the trimester of pregnancy 
and exposure to armed conflict in the data analysis.37 
No statistically significant difference was found in birth 
weights between groups exposed at different periods 
throughout pregnancy.
dIscussIon
The results suggest that exposure to armed conflict 
increases the incidence of adverse outcomes in preg-
nancy. The extent to which this is the case cannot be 
easily quantified. The most convincing evidence suggests 
that the incidence of low birthweight infants increases 
with maternal exposure to armed conflict. Four of the 
nine studies reporting this significant relationship 
between exposure to armed conflict and low birth weight 
have been assessed to have a relatively low risk of bias. 
The effect sizes from the other five studies, however, may 
have a higher risk of bias due to the lack of adjustment 
for confounders and limited data on measures of expo-
sure to conflict. In addition, there is some more limited 
evidence supporting increased rates of miscarriage, 
prematurity, stillbirth, premature rupture of membranes 
and congenital abnormalities.
However, the heterogeneity of the available research 
does cause some difficulty in assessing the overall avail-
able evidence. The included studies considered a wide 
range of different sample populations. For instance, 
Pavlinac et al provide data on a specialist tertiary centre 
(dealing with a higher proportion of high-risk pregnan-
cies), whereas Skokic et al focus on a regular obstetric 
clinic. As the specialist centre will be providing care for 
more complex cases, we may expect to have higher rates 
of adverse outcomes. In addition, the measures of expo-
sure used varied across studies; while some used more 
general indicators such as country of birth to measure 
exposure,39 others considered much more specific indi-
cators through the use of exposure questionnaires27 or 
through consideration of exact dates of birth in relation 
to the most intense periods of armed conflict.37 Finally, 
it is challenging to compare studies directly due to 
heterogeneity in reporting of statistics with some authors 
providing solely p values or OR values within the original 
research paper.
There are several limitations to this review. Many 
of the studies did not fit neatly into the SIGN 50 study 
design classification algorithm or, because they were 
cross-sectional or interrupted time series, were deemed 
to be low-quality evidence. In addition, as with all system-
atic reviews, there is the potential for publication bias, 
namely that the evidence published is skewed in favour 
of significant positive findings. The review does not 
consider grey literature. While organisations such as 
the UN, Médécins sans Frontières and the Red Cross do 
collect wartime data, after a preliminary grey literature 
search the authors agreed only to include peer-reviewed 
studies. Finally, this review only considers studies written 
in English—widening the scope may have yielded some 
further evidence on this global topic.
There were also several common themes in the 
limitations described by the studies, many of which are 
related to the constraints of conducting a study in this 
field. Armed conflict limits the opportunities to collect 
complete sets of data and the fact that researchers are 
not always anticipating armed conflict means that they 
are often restricted with the types of studies that they can 
perform. Indeed, many studies were rejected from inclu-
sion in this review because they were solely descriptive, 
identifying broad trends but not including enough data 
to perform statistical analysis. In addition, the limited 
data on confounding factors are expected to have influ-
enced the results of the studies. This is likely due to the 
lack of available data rather than weak methodologies. 
Furthermore, the totality of armed conflict means that 
many different factors play roles in influencing the rate 
of adverse outcomes in pregnancy. As Valente comments, 
‘it is difficult to pinpoint the relative importance of each 
of these sources of maternal stress’ when contextualising 
the findings of these studies.38 As a result, even some 
of the studies that were included in the final synthesis 
had a relatively strong risk of bias. Three of the studies 
relating to low birth weight, for example, have a weak 
level of evidence despite having the largest numbers of 
participants.30–32 Indeed seven of the studies included 
in the synthesis are interrupted time series. While these 
concerns do not suggest that the evidence should be

disregarded, it should be considered in the context of the 
practicalities of data collection during or after a war. In 
particular, the effect sizes of the three studies mentioned 
with large numbers of participants may have a higher 
risk of bias. In addition, there is limited adjustment for 
confounders in some of the studies.28–30 However, the 
authors suggest that conclusions may still be drawn from 
the four other studies considering low birth weight that 
have a relatively low risk of bias.27 35 37 39
In addition, several of the studies relate to countries 
which have a long history of short armed conflicts or 
short periods of peace between longer armed conflicts; 
this means that many of the control populations could 
well have been exposed to similar conflicts in the past. 
This is particularly pertinent for the armed conflicts in 
Israel, Palestine, Iraq and Somalia. It also suggests that 
any distinctions made between the effects of acute rather 
than chronic armed conflict may be more challenging to 
make. Furthermore, none of the studies define war or 
armed conflict in general terms, again making it difficult 
to distinguish between the effects of various aspects of 
armed conflict (eg, acute stressful events compared with 
long-term disruption of medical facilities). Ultimately this 
makes it challenging to fully comprehend the short-term 
or long-term effects of armed conflicts on pregnancy.
conclusIon
In conclusion, the evidence reviewed in this study 
suggests that exposure to armed conflict has a multitude 
of effects on outcomes in pregnancy. In particular, expo-
sure to armed conflict increases the risk of having low 
birthweight infants. The long-term health implications of 
low birth weight are significant because individuals are at 
increased risk of morbidity and mortality and will require 
increased medical care throughout their lives.40While 
the evidence for other outcomes is less strong, the review 
also identifies increased incidence of adverse outcomes 
in mothers exposed to armed conflict. Further well-con-
ducted studies are needed to add weight to conclusions 
drawn so far. Nonetheless, the findings of this review 
should be borne in mind when treating patients exposed 
to armed conflict and systems should be implemented 
to support these individuals. Clinicians should consider 
using ultrasound scans more frequently in the cases of 
such mothers in order to effectively care for patients who 
are at a higher risk of giving birth to an infant of low birth 
weight. This will only be possible if warring parties are 
committed to following the Geneva Convention, refrain 
from attacking healthcare facilities and workers, and are 
adequately resourced.41 Until this happens, women and 
their infants will be at continued risk of adverse outcomes 
in pregnancy. Recommendations about pregnancy moni-
toring are also particularly important to consider for 
clinicians in other countries, who may be treating women 
displaced due to armed conflict.
