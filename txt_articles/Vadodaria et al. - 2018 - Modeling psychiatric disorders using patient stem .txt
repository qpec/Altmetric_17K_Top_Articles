forward

Editorial summary
Our understanding of the neurobiology of psychiatric
disorders remains limited, and biomarker-based clinical
management is yet to be developed. Induced
pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology has revolutionized
our capacity to generate patient-derived neurons to
model psychiatric disorders. Here, we highlight advantages
and caveats of iPSC disease modeling and outline
strategies for addressing current challenges.
The iPSC toolkit to capture genetic complexity
Even as neuropsychiatric research has boomed, psychi-
atric disorders have remained a leading cause of global
morbidity and disease burden [1]. Currently, diagnosis is
primarily qualitative, based on behavioral, cognitive, and
emotional symptoms as delineated in the Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5). The
subjective nature of this existing clinical paradigm fails
to incorporate biological data—for example, blood-based
tests, imaging, or genetics—leading to unclear distinc-
tions between disorders and hampering tailored thera-
peutic recommendations [2]. Research using animal
models has provided insights into the neural mecha-
nisms underlying endophenotypes, such as quantifiable
components of the genes-to-behavior pathways associated
with psychiatric disorders, but how precisely these find-
ings can be extrapolated to human mental health remains
difficult to assess [3]. Large-scale human genome-wide as-
sociation studies (GWASs) for highly heritable polygenic
psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, have led to
the discovery of numerous disease-associated but small
effect-size variants. For less heritable and more heteroge-
neous disorders with a gradation of disease severity and

variable sets of symptoms, disease genes are more difficult
to identify, highlighting the need for patient-population
stratification and larger sample sizes [4].
As a result, definitive diagnoses and treatment strat-
egies based on objective biomarkers continue to evade
us. The development of human iPSC technology offers
one approach to allow researchers to address the genetic
complexity issue in psychiatric disorder research. Som-
atic cells such as skin fibroblasts from adult patients can
be dedifferentiated to a pluripotent state by transient
overexpression of the reprogramming transcription fac-
tors. Theoretically, iPSC clones can then be differenti-
ated to any other cell type by exposure to an appropriate
combination of patterning molecules. Parallel in vitro
disease modeling efforts for studying the neural corre-
lates of disease-associated genotypes may provide novel
insights into the neurological underpinnings of psychi-
atric disorders [5]. iPSCs and related transdifferentiation
technologies have the capacity to generate previously in-
accessible disease-relevant neural cell types from adult
patients with known symptom histories, genetics, and
drug response profiles. These cellular technologies facili-
tate the study of mental disorders at a scale and reso-
lution previously not possible.
Overcoming obstacles to neuropsychiatric disease
modeling
A central goal of biological psychiatry is to understand
how healthy and aberrant brain function may arise from
the interaction of neural circuits. Crucial to this effort is
generating relevant neural cell types from iPSCs, because
studying the basic units of neural circuits in isolation en-
ables the construction of in vitro model systems. Given
the diversity of cell types in the mammalian brain, the
field continues to develop protocols for generating rela-
tively homogeneous populations of neuronal and glial
subtypes, as well as genetic reporters to help label and
identify specific cell types in mixed populations [6]. This

 approach is valuable for controlling cell-type hetero-
geneity so that appropriate comparisons can be made
between individuals, which may enable the discovery of
disease-associated cell type-specific defects and bio-
markers. Given that specific neurotransmitter systems
are targets of psychotropic drugs and have been impli-
cated in the neuropathology of psychiatric disorders,
another advantage of generating neurotransmitter- and
region-specific neuronal subtypes is the ability to study
pre- and post-synaptic cellular compartments in a seg-
regated manner, which is difficult to do in vivo. Al-
though it is possible to study brain regions in live
patients with neuroimaging, or to use transcriptomic or
histological analysis in post-mortem tissue, it is difficult
to decipher from these methods whether observed dif-
ferences are causative or a consequence of a lifetime of
illness
and
pharmacological
intervention.
In
vitro
disease modeling offers an approach where such vari-
ables can be controlled for. Studies using iPSC-derived
neurons from patients with psychiatric disorders such
as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and autism spectrum
disorders have uncovered disease- and, in some cases,
gene-associated phenotypes in key processes such as
progenitor
cell
proliferation,
migration,
neuronal
morphology, connectivity, synaptic maturation, and
neuronal
activity
[5].
For
example,
introducing
a
disease-associated mutation in the disrupted in schizo-
phrenia 1 (DISC1) gene altered synaptic activity and
downstream signaling in iPSC-derived neurons, estab-
lishing a causal relationship between patient genetics
and
cellular
phenotypes
[5].
Furthermore,
drug
treatment and transcriptome analyses from patient
iPSC-derived cells have pointed to altered molecular
signaling pathways as contributors to disease-associated
in vitro cellular phenotypes [5].
Fine-tuning the iPSC model system
While recent studies provide evidence for mechanisms
that may contribute to disease pathology, excitement
must be tempered by experimental knowledge address-
ing the caveats of in vitro disease modeling (Fig. 1). A
downside of iPSC technology is a significant loss of epi-
genetic modifications after reprogramming, which poses
a challenge for studying the impact of environmental
factors on psychiatric disorders. However, it is possible
that some epigenetic modifications are recapitulated
following neuronal maturation in vitro [6]. Further-
more, iPSC-derived neurons are immature and their
transcriptional profile is comparable to fetal neurons.
Therefore, in vitro phenotypes may represent develop-
mental phenomena preceding disease manifestation,
presenting an opportunity for studying psychiatric dis-
orders during development.
Another issue is that of variability between cell lines
and across experimental batches, possibly due to somatic
mosaicism in donor cells prior to reprogramming, accu-
mulation of de novo mutations with selective advan-
tages,
stochastic
events
during
differentiation,
and
heterogeneous
patient
genetics
[6].
However,
iPSC
models which capture patient heterogeneity may provide
a system for individually tailored assays for diagnostics
and drug testing. As a complex picture of the variables
at play emerges, complementary approaches and study
designs addressing these caveats will be necessary to
glean biologically meaningful information (Fig. 1).
One such approach is the stratification of large patient
cohorts based on factors such as genetic risk, pharmaco-
logical response profiles, distinctive and quantitative
endophenotypes, or comorbidities with other diseases.
Modeling genetic risk includes rare variants conferring
large genetic risk, such as copy number variation, or

in psychiatric disorders requires a diverse array of research tools. Each of these tools has unique strengths (red) and weaknesses (blue), thereby
complementing one another. Here we summarize four techniques: induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) models, rodent models, genome-wide
association studies (GWAS), and neuroimaging

 higher frequency common variants, such as single nucleo-
tide polymorphisms, conferring relatively lower risk [4].
Cellular phenotypes associated with highly penetrant mu-
tations can be studied using genome-edited isogenic iPSC
lines or patient-derived iPSC lines. Experiments with the
latter would ideally entail one-to-one comparisons be-
tween diseased and healthy individuals from the same
family, controlling for genetic background. However, for
idiopathic patient cohorts, genetic contributors are often
unknown, and patient cohort segregation using drug re-
sponsiveness has proven to be a successful strategy for
uncovering cellular phenotypes in, for example, schizo-
phrenia and bipolar disorder [5]. Additionally, exploring
the effects of pharmacological agents on human neural
cells in vitro has indicated which molecular pathways and
phenotypes may be therapeutically relevant. Collective
data from such studies could provide deeper understand-
ing of how diverse genetic risk factors converge on com-
mon biological processes and cellular phenotypes.
Another strategy is to study iPSC-derived neurons
from a subset of well-characterized patients from a lar-
ger cohort. Here, in vitro phenotypes can be correlated
with multiple continuous variables such as clinical sever-
ity, behavioral/biological measures, brain activity, and
blood metabolites. Obtaining such multidimensional
data from even small patient cohorts could inform the
predictive value of individual variables and lead to the
discovery of biomarkers. The explosion of rich neuro-
psychiatric disease sequence databases coincides with
the emergence of powerful and accessible predictive ma-
chine learning tools. In conjunction with large-scale gen-
etic data, deep-learning models may enjoy improved
performance by using intermediate cellular phenotypes
from patient-derived cells to bridge the gap between mo-
lecular and circuit or clinical features [7].
In addition to careful study design, picking appropriate
in vitro models will be critical for discovering clinically
relevant in vitro phenotypes. Three-dimensional iPSC-
derived organoids may be able to recapitulate maturation-
related signatures in developing circuits, as has been suc-
cessfully done with autism spectrum disorder [8]. Simi-
larly, transdifferentiation of adult somatic cells directly to
neurons may partially conserve non-cell autonomous dis-
ease- and age-related epigenetic signatures that may be
lost during reprogramming. Interestingly, processes such
as inflammation have been implicated in psychiatric disor-
ders, and microglia and astrocytes are emerging as central
players in this process. Generating inflammation-sensitive
glial cells from patient-derived iPSCs and co-culture ex-
periments with neurons may prove useful for studying
disease-relevant cellular interactions [9].
It is increasingly clear that gaining fresh insights into
the biology of psychiatric disorders demands a multi-
pronged approach, including but not limited to patient
iPSC-based diseased modeling. Furthermore, concerted
efforts across laboratories for tackling the inherent vari-
ability of in vitro systems may pave the way for estab-
lishing standardized in vitro parameters, which would be
immensely helpful for moving toward high-throughput
profiling and screening in the future [10]. Despite the
gap in our knowledge of the biological causes underlying
mental illness, iPSC technology—situated at the intersec-
tion of molecular biology and higher-order circuit prop-
erties—is well positioned to play an important role in
disease study and biomarker discovery. We anticipate
that, in the future, it may be possible to use patient
iPSCs for predictive diagnoses and precision medicine.
