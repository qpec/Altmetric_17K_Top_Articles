Abstract
 Background & Aims—Physicians frequently encounter patients with immune-mediated 
diseases and a history of malignancy. There are limited data on the safety of immunosuppressive 
therapy for these patients. Published studies have been small with few events, precluding robust 
estimates of risk.
 Methods—We searched Medline, EMBASE, and conference proceedings for terms related to 
immune mediated disease, immune-suppressive therapy, and cancer recurrence from inception to 
April 2015. We included 16 studies (9 of patients with rheumatoid arthritis, 8 of patients with 
inflammatory bowel disease, and of patients with psoriasis) and stratified studies by type of 
immune-suppressive therapy (monoclonal antibodies to tumor necrosis factor [anti-TNF], 
conventional immune-modulatory agents, or no immune suppression). A random effects meta-

 analysis was performed to calculate pooled incidence rates as well as risk differences between the 
various treatments.
 Results—Our analysis included 11,702 persons contributing 31,258 person-years (p-y) of 
follow up after a prior diagnosis of cancer. Rates of cancer recurrence were similar among 
individuals receiving anti-TNF therapy (33.8/1000 p-y), immune-modulator therapy (36.2/1000 p-
y), or no immunosuppression (37.5/1000 p-y), but were numerically higher among patients 
receiving combination immune suppression (54.5/1000 p-y) (P>.1 for all). Subgroup analysis of 
new and recurrent cancers separately, type of immune-modulator therapy, or immune-mediated 
disease revealed similar results, with no increase in risk. We found similar pooled incidence values 
for new or primary cancers when immunosuppression was initiated within 6 years (33.6/1000 p-y 
for immune-modulatory agents and 43.7/1000 p-y for anti-TNF agents) vs more 6 years after the 
index cancer (32.9/1000 p-y for immune-modulatory agents; P=.86 and 21.0/1000 p-y for anti-
TNF agents; P=.43)
 Conclusion—In a meta-analysis of 16 studies, we observed similar rates of cancer recurrence 
among individuals with prior cancer who received no immunosuppression, anti-TNF therapy, 
immune-modulator therapy, or combination treatments. Prospective studies are needed to ascertain 
optimal intervals for re-initiation of immune suppressive therapies for individuals with specific 
cancers.

 INTRODUCTION
Immunosuppression is the cornerstone of management of chronic inflammatory diseases 
including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD; Crohn’s disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC)), 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and psoriasis (Ps) which together affect more than 10 million 
individuals in the United States and several million more worldwide–. These diseases share 
common underlying genetic and immunologic mechanisms and are progressive and 
disabling, exerting a considerable toll of physical, psychological, and socioeconomic 
impairment–. Consequently, treatment paradigms have evolved, moving from amelioration 
of symptoms to early aggressive immunosuppressive treatment to achieve remission and 
prevent irreversible complications, . This has resulted in wider use of conventional 
immunosuppression (IMM) with thiopurines (azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine) and 
methotrexate and targeted biologic therapy predominantly with monoclonal antibodies to 
tumor necrosis factor α (anti-TNF), often given in combination with conventional agents–.
The improved efficacy of treatment regimens with conventional immunosupressants and 
anti-TNF agents must be balanced against an associated increased risk of cancer due to 
impaired immune surveillance, facilitation of oncogenic viruses–, and perhaps alteration in 
DNA. For example, thiopurines are associated with an increased risk of lymphoma 
(primarily non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma) while this association for anti-TNF therapies is less 
clear–. In addition, anti-TNF therapy, thiopurines, and methotrexate are all associated with 
an increased risk of skin cancers (melanoma and non-melanoma)–. In contrast, other than

 cervical cancer, the risk of solid organ cancer development appears unaltered. However, 
despite the modest increase in risk of malignancy, the absolute risk of incident cancers in 
individuals with no prior cancer remains very low, providing reassurance regarding the wide 
spread use of such treatment strategies in the population, .
Given improvements in cancer survival over the past few decades, physicians are 
increasingly treating patients with chronic inflammatory diseases and a prior cancer 
diagnosis. Many treatment guidelines and expert opinions recommend restricted use of 
immunosuppression for at least 5 years following a diagnosis of cancer–. However, there are 
limited clinical data to support this recommendation or to establish a safe interval for 
restarting therapy. A few observational cohorts and registry-based studies suggested no 
increase in risk of cancer recurrence; however, the event rates were low, limiting statistical 
power to identify a true effect–. In addition, few prior studies have been able to compare the 
rate of recurrence of prior cancer or development of a new primary cancer between the 
different types of immunosuppressive therapy–, –. Given the growing availability of different 
therapeutic targets, comparative safety studies are critical to appropriately position these 
therapies.
We performed this systematic review and meta-analysis to (1) identify the rates of 
recurrence of prior cancers and development of new primary cancers in individuals with 
chronic immunologic diseases treated with immunosuppressive therapy after a prior 
malignancy; and (2) perform pair-wise comparisons of such rates between the treatment 
groups in those on no immunosuppression, conventional immunosuppression, and anti-TNF 
biologic therapies.
 METHODS
 Literature Search
We conducted separate MEDLINE (inception to April 2015) and EMBASE (inception to 
April 2015) searches of all relevant English language articles and manually searched 
reference lists from potentially relevant studies. Additionally, abstracts of scientific meetings 
from American Gastroenterological Association, the American College of Gastroenterology, 
the United European Gastroenterology Week, the European Crohn’s and Colitis 
Organization, the Inflammatory skin disease summit, the American College of 
Rheumatology, the European League Against Rheumatism and the British Society for 
Rheumatology were searched until April 2015. Studies were identified by combining four 
search themes using the Boolean operator “AND”. The first theme, inflammatory mediated 
diseases, combined the terms Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, inflammatory bowel 
disease, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, systemic lupus erythematosus, or ankylosing 
spondylitis. The second theme, immunosuppressive therapies, combined the terms 
azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, thiopurine, methotrexate, immunomodulator, anti-tnf agent, 
tumor necrosis factor inhibitor, infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab, certolizumab, or 
etanercept. The third theme, recurrence, combined the terms recurrent, recurrence, prior, 
preexisting, previous, or survivor. The fourth theme, cancer, combined the terms cancer, 
malignancy or neoplasm. We did not include studies of cancer recurrence following organ

 transplantation as the immunosuppressive regimens used in that clinical setting are distinct 
from those used for inflammatory diseases.
 Inclusion and Exclusion criteria
We included all cohort or case-control studies assessing the impact of thiopurines, 
methotrexate, or anti-TNF agents on the risk of recurrent or new primary cancer in patients 
with immune mediated diseases and a history of prior malignancy. Some studies in RA did 
not differentiate between immunosuppressive and non-immunosuppressive DMARDs 
(sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine). However, as the majority of patients in such cohorts 
were on immunosuppression, they were included in the conventional immunosuppressant 
category. Studies were categorized as population-based or clinic-based. Studies with or 
without a control population were eligible for inclusion. However, studies reporting 
incidence of primary cancers in an unselected population (not restricted to those with prior 
cancers) were not included.
 Data Collection
The decision for inclusion of each study was made independently by 2 of the authors (E.S 
and A.A). Data was extracted including year of publication, study design and location, 
number of included patients, immune-mediated disease type, type of prior cancer (non-
melanoma skin cancer, melanoma, lymphoma, breast, solid organ and mixed), treatment 
exposure, and number of new and/or recurrent cancers. Information was also obtained on the 
proportion of high-risk cancers (bladder, sarcoma, malignant melanoma, renal, non-
melanoma skin cancer, and myeloma), stratifying by risk of cancer recurrence as previously 
described by Penn et al.. For each study, type of immunosuppression, person-years (p-y) of 
follow-up, and number of new primary and recurrent cancers were extracted from published 
findings and incidence rate per 1,000 p-y and confidence intervals (CI) were calculated 
assuming a Poisson distribution. Incident cancers were defined as new or recurrent, with 
new cancers being those that developed in a different organ from the organ associated with 
the previous cancer or in the same organ with a different histological type. In a majority of 
the studies, person-time of exposure was calculated from the date of diagnosis of the initial 
cancer. For patients re-initiating immunosuppression, this was done so at varying intervals 
after the index cancer. Where the complete data was not available in the abstract or full 
publication, personal communication was made with the corresponding authors to obtain 
missing information.
 Study Quality
Due to the lack of applicability of existing study assessment quality scales, we developed a 
tool to assess quality of included studies by consensus among the study investigators. This 
score was based on six criteria: (1) inclusion of an unselected or consecutive cohort of 
patients with prior cancer exposed to immunosuppression; (2) availability of a control 
population within the same geographic area and disease type; (3) use of a systematic 
protocol to identify new or recurrent cancers; (4) distinction between recurrent cancers and 
new primary malignancy; (5) provision of time interval between index cancer and re-
introduction of immunosuppression; and (6) sufficient follow-up (≥ 2 years) after exposure

 to develop new cancer or recurrent cancers. Studies meeting four or more criteria were 
considered high quality studies.
 Statistical Analysis
Pooled incidence rates with their 95% CI for new primaries or recurrent cancers among 
patients with prior cancer were calculated per 1000 p-y of exposure, stratifying by exposure 
to anti-TNF biologic therapy, IMM therapy, or no immunosuppression (no IS). We 
calculated pooled incidence rates across exposures rather than meta-analyzing incident rate 
differences from each study as many of the studies included only one exposure group. In a 
secondary analysis, where data was available for more than one exposure group within the 
same study, we calculated a pooled incident rate difference for new primary or recurrent 
cancers between the different exposures. Owing to the heterogeneity between studies, meta-
analysis was performed using a random effects model, using the DerSimonian-Laird 
weights. Heterogeneity between studies was assessed using the Cochran’s Q and i2 statistic 
with values ranging from 0% (no heterogeneity) to 100%; values > 50% indicated significant 
heterogeneity. Between group comparisons in the pooled incidence rates of cancer were 
performed using meta-regression with p < 0.05 indicating a statistically significant treatment 
effect. Meta-regression was also performed to identify sources of heterogeneity including 
study design, location, age, proportion of high-risk cancers, prior cancer subtypes, number 
of participants and publication year. Where significant effects were identified, stratified 
analysis was performed. Additionally, pre-specified subgroup analyses were performed (i) 
by type of immune-mediated disease; (ii) new primary malignancies and recurrent cancers 
separately; (iii) proportion of high-risk cancer ≥ 50% of the cohort; (iv) by type of index 
cancer (hematologic, skin, solid organ); and (v) type of immunomodulator therapy 
(thiopurines, methotrexate). In this analysis, where separate data was not available for 
thiopurine and methotrexate users, studies were assigned the category of the most frequent 
agent. Publication bias was examined utilizing funnel plots by the Begg’s and Egger’s 
methods. All data were recorded in a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet (Microsoft Corp, 
Redmond, WA) and analyzed using Stata 13.2 (StataCorp, College Station, TX).
 RESULTS
 Literature Search
Our search identified 570 citations in MEDLINE and 1,526 citations in EMBASE (Figure 
1). After reviewing the title and abstract and if necessary, full publications, 5 relevant studies 
(5 full papers) from MEDLINE and 24 relevant studies from EMBASE (10 full papers, 14 
conference abstracts) were retrieved for full review. Following direct communication, the 
corresponding author provided 1 unpublished study currently in submission corresponding 
to a prior abstract. Eleven articles represented duplicate data– and we were unable to obtain 
sufficient information for analysis from 5 studies– resulting in a final cohort of 16 unique 
studies–, , – (Table 1). There was an equal number of studies in IBD, –, , and RA, , , , –, with 1 
study combining both populations and 1 study in psoriasis. Ten studies were population-
based–, , , , , and 12 studies adopted a cohort design–, , , , , , , . Three were from North 
America, , , twelve from Europe–, –, , , , and one from Asia. The included studies investigated 
a spectrum of prior cancers (Table 1). Most commonly, studies grouped together all prior

 cancers (including non-melanoma skin cancers) (n=12). One study each examined only non-
melanoma skin cancer, lymphoma or breast cancer. The proportion of patients with a high 
risk index cancer subtype according to the Penn classification ranged from 0% to 100%. 
Thirteen studies reported on cancer recurrence after anti-TNF exposure–, –, , –, 12 on 
IMM–, , , 3 on combination therapy, , and 6 on patients with no IS, , , , , (Table 2). The interval 
between index cancer and initiation of immunosuppression was available in 9 studies 
(median interval 6.2 years, range 0.0 – 10.3 years).
From the 16 included studies, all included patients were from an unselected cohort with 10 
having a control population, 13 having a systematic method for identifying incident cancer, 
10 differentiating new and recurrent cancer and 9 defining the interval between cancer and 
commencement of immunosuppressive therapy (Supplemental Table 1). The median person-
years of follow-up were unable to be calculated for two studies. Fourteen studies met our 
pre-defined criteria of being of high quality.
 Risk of cancer recurrence according to immunosuppression type
The pooled analysis included 11,702 persons contributing 31,258 p-y of follow-up after 
prior cancer diagnosis. There were 1,698 instances of a new primary or recurrent cancer 
(1,366 new cancers, 154 recurrent cancers, and 84 where this distinction could not be 
determined). In the no IS group (n = 4,222), there were 609 new or recurrent cancers over 
12,404 person-years of follow-up, yielding a pooled incidence rate of 37.5 per 1000 p-y 
(95% CI 20.2 – 54.7) (Figure 2). However, there was significant heterogeneity between the 
studies (i2=94.3%, p < 0.001) with incidence rates ranging from 0 to 62.5 per 1000 p-y. A 
total of 1,753 subjects contributing 5,842 person-years of follow-up were exposed to anti-
TNF therapy after a prior cancer. There were 215 cases of new or recurrent cancer, yielding 
a pooled incidence rate of 33.8 per 1000 p-y (95% CI 22.3 – 45.2), similar to that observed 
in the no IS group (range 0 to 84.5 per 1,000 p-y) (p=0.48). The pooled incidence rate in 
subjects placed on conventional immunosuppressant therapy after prior cancer was similar to 
the no IS (p=0.59) and anti-TNF groups with an incidence of 36.2 per 1000 p-y (95% CI 
17.7 – 54.7) (p=0.84). This group included 718 incident cancers (new primary or recurrent) 
among 4,382 subjects contributing 10,508 person-years of follow-up. Three studies provided 
rates on cancer recurrence with combination immunosuppression therapy, , with a pooled 
incidence rate of 54.5 per 1,000 p-y (95% CI 29.7 – 79.3). While numerically greater, this 
was not statistically different from that with each of the individual therapies (p=0.23 
compared to anti-TNF, p=0.27 compared to IMM) or with no immunosuppression (p=0.47).
 Subgroup analyses
We repeated the analysis separately for new cancers and recurrent cancers. The pooled 
incidence rates of new cancers were not statistically different between the no IS (24.9 / 1000 
p-y; 95% CI 5.6 – 44.3), anti-TNF (28.8 / 1000 p-y; 95% CI 7.6 – 50.0, p=0.53) and IMM 
(38.4 / 1000 p-y; 95% CI 12.2 – 64.6, p=0.33) groups respectively though the latter had 
numerically the highest rates (Figure 3). Similarly, analysis of recurrent cancers also 
revealed no statistically significant difference in rates between the three groups (Figure 4). 
Heterogeneity between the study groups persisted in both the above analyses.

 Analyses including only patients with IBD (Supplemental Figure 1) or RA (Supplemental 
Figure 2) yielded similar absolute and relative risk differences between the various treatment 
groups. Among 3,706 IBD patients contributing 10,332 person-years of follow-up, there 
were 539 cases of new or recurrent cancer. The pooled incidence rate among subjects on no 
IS, IMM, or anti-TNF was 35.7 per 1000 p-y, 37.9 per 1000 p-y and 48.5 per 1000 p-y 
respectively, with no statistical difference between the groups (p > 0.30 for all). Among 
7,985 RA patients contributing 20,926 person-years of follow-up and 1,159 new or recurrent 
cancers, the pooled incidence rate among subjects on no IS, IMM, or anti-TNF was 47.3, 
35.1, and 28.8 per 1000 p-y respectively (p > 0.2). We compared rates of recurrence of prior 
cancer or new primary between users of thiopurine therapy compared to those on 
methotrexate. This yielded similar rates of new or recurrent cancer with thiopurines (37.9 
per 1,000 p-y, 95% CI 5.9 – 69.9) compared to methotrexate (38.9, 95% CI 14.7 – 63.0) 
(p=0.78).
Given heterogeneity of incident cancer subtypes, we repeated the analysis stratifying by type 
of index cancer. Among the two studies that included index skin cancer alone, the risk of 
new or recurrent cancers was statistically significantly greater with IMM (71.6 per 1000 p-y, 
95% CI 58.9 – 84.2, p=0.035) when compared to no IS (50.8 per 1,000 p-y, 95% CI 43.7 – 
57.8) and numerically (but not statistically) higher than anti-TNF therapy (55.5 per 1,000 p-
y, 95% CI 44.7 – 66.3, p=0.22). In contrast, excluding studies with skin cancer as the index 
malignancy yielded similar rates of new or recurrent cancer with IMM (26.3 per 1,000 p-y, 
95% CI 13.3 – 39.3), anti-TNF (24.3 per 1,000 p-y, 95% CI 16.0 – 32.5) or no IS (31.2 per 
1,000 p-y, 95% CI 7.9 – 54.5) (p > 0.30 for all).
 Meta-Regression analyses
Four variables met statistical significance on meta-regression – proportion of high risk 
cancers (p < 0.001), mean age (p=0.03), number of included patients (p=0.02) and inclusion 
of individuals with prior skin cancer (p < 0.001) (Supplemental Table 2). Type of 
inflammatory disease, study design, or interval between index cancer and initiation of 
immunosuppression were not predictive of increased rates of recurrence (p=0.25). Our 
estimates remained robust on sequential exclusion of each study (data not shown).
 Meta-analysis of incidence rate differences
We repeated the random effects meta-analysis among studies that included a control 
population for comparison with an index group. In the random effects model, there was a 
lower rate of new or recurrent cancer with anti-TNF biologic therapy compared to IMM (8 
studies, 5,867 patients, incidence rate difference= −9.8 per 1000 p-y, 95% CI = −19.5 to 
−0.1) (Figure 5). While there was no statistically difference for IMM therapy compared to 
no IS (4 studies, 7,884 patients; incidence rate difference = 11.9 per 1,000 p-y, 95% CI = 
−2.4 to 26.3), the number of included studies was small and consequently our statistical 
power was lower. There was also no difference in incident rates for anti-TNF therapy 
compared to no IS (−4.5 per 1,000 p-y, 95% CI −25.6 to 16.5) (3 studies, 4,726 patients).

  Sensitivity Analyses
We performed a number of sensitivity analyses to examine the robustness of our inclusion 
criteria and quality of included studies. Excluding studies that were published only in 
abstract form yielded similar pooled incidence ratios for all groups (IMM 38.7, Anti-TNF 
34.9, Combination therapy 54.1, and no IS 38.7/1,000 p-y respectively). To avoid bias 
introduced by small studies or low frequency outcomes, we repeated the analysis including 
only studies with least 50 participants in each arm which also showed no statistically 
significant difference between the groups (IMM 41.9, Anti-TNF 34.4, Combination therapy 
56.1, no IS 46.2/1,000 p-y) as did analyses which required at least 10 outcomes in each 
group (58.2, 44.6, 52.9, and 46.2/1,000 p-y respectively for IMM, anti-TNF, combination 
therapy, and no IS). We repeated the analysis stratifying studies by whether 
immunosuppression was introduced within or after our median interval of 6 years. When 
immunosuppression was initiated within a median of 6 years, the pooled incidence of new or 
recurrent cancers on IMM or anti-TNF therapy was 33.6 and 43.7/1000 p-y respectively 
which was similar in magnitude to when immunosuppression was introduced after 6 years 
(IMM 32.9/1000 p-y, p=0.86; anti-TNF 21.0/1000 p-y, p=0.43 when compared to within 6 
years). All estimates were statistically similar to risk with no IS (p > 0.50). Stratifying by 
whether median follow-up was less than or more than the median for our analysis, we found 
numerical but no statistically significant difference between the various treatment arms. For 
studies with median follow up less than 36 months, the pooled incidence rates with no IS, 
IMM, anti-TNF, and combination therapy were 32.7, 41.4, 42.4, and 67.7/1,000 p-y 
respectively. For those with a median follow-up of over 36 months, the pooled incidence 
rates with no IS, IMM, anti-TNF and combination therapy were 56.6, 28.6, 24.2, and 35.6 
per 1,000 p-y respectively. Excluding the two studies rated as not being high quality did not 
alter our estimates.
 Publication bias
Both the Egger’s and Begg’s tests revealed no publication bias (p=0.42 and 0.78 
respectively) (Supplemental Figure 3).
 DISCUSSION
Physicians have historically been reluctant to recommence immunosuppressive therapy in 
patients with a history of cancer. For example, in a study from Saint-Antoine Hospital, IBD 
patients with prior cancer had comparable disease activity, but had lower use of IMM and 
higher rates of surgery than those without prior cancer. Data on risk of new cancer in those 
with prior malignancy exposed to immunosuppressive therapy are sparse and the published 
studies to date are limited by the small number of events making it difficult to draw 
definitive conclusions–, –. In this meta-analysis, no increased risk of cancer recurrence was 
found in patients with chronic immune mediated diseases initiating immunosuppression with 
either conventional immunosuppressant or anti-TNF biologic therapy after a prior diagnosis 
of cancer. To our knowledge, ours is the first meta-analysis to analyze this risk, including 
over 11,702 persons and 31,258 person years of follow-up, combining data from diverse 
populations. These results were robust both in analyses using pooled incidence rates as well 
as including only those studies with a control group for comparison.

 Among the various immunosuppressive regimens, no overall difference in risk was observed 
between conventional immunosuppressant and anti-TNF biologics using pooled incidence 
rates, while studies that included both IMM and anti-TNF arms showed a weak effect 
favoring lower recurrence rates with anti-TNF therapy compared to thiopurines. This is 
consistent with the pooled experience with these agents in patients without a history of 
cancer, where the risk of primary cancers such as lymphoma appears to be similar 
quantitatively with either therapy, or favors lower rates with anti-TNF compared to 
conventional immunosuppressants. However, it is important to note that while the risks were 
broadly similar for all cancers, there may be cancer-specific associations with individual 
therapies. Anti-TNF biologics have been associated with greater risk of melanoma but not 
non-melanoma skin cancers while conversely thiopurines may increase likelihood of non-
melanoma cancers and less so for melanoma, . This interpretation is supported by a higher 
pooled incidence rate with IMM when compared to no IS or anti-TNF therapy when 
including only those with index skin cancer alone in contrast to the comparable incidence 
rates for studies not restricted to index skin cancer. Thus, individualized decision making is 
essential particularly for cancers that have been associated with a specific therapy.
Despite differences in demographics (older age among RA participants) and medication use 
(more common use of methotrexate in RA), we identified no differences in overall rates of 
recurrent or new cancers between both diseases and the relative safety of IMM and anti-TNF 
compared to no IS was also similar across the two. We also found no statistical difference in 
rates of new or recurrent cancer between thiopurines and methotrexate therapy though 
thiopurine use was almost entirely in those with IBD while methotrexate use was in those in 
RA. In the one study that contributed the most number of patients with each therapy, there 
was a numerically but not statistically higher rate of new NMSC with thiopurines (85.4 / 
1,000 p-y) compared to methotrexate (67.8 / 1,000 p-y). We also, reassuringly, found a 
statistically similar pooled incidence rate of recurrence in those on combination 
immunosuppression though only a small subset of studies contributed to this analysis, , . This 
is in contrast to prior studies demonstrating an increased overall risk of index cancers with 
combination therapy compared with anti-TNF monotherapy in IBD.
The data presented have direct clinical relevance. Our study provides reassurance about 
restarting immunosuppressive therapy in patients with prior cancer, with the caveat that we 
were unable to ascertain the exact interval at which recommencement would be safe as this 
was at the discretion of the treating physician in each of the studies. There is heterogeneity 
in natural history of IBD with varying risks of recurrence of disease-related symptoms after 
therapy cessation. Comprehensive models that can predict this outcome may be helpful in 
identifying those at highest risk for IBD relapse, and consequently most likely to require 
early re-initiation of immunosuppressive therapy for IBD after the index cancer diagnosis, , . 
While many existing guidelines recommend avoiding immunosuppression for 5 years after 
index cancer–, our data may provide reassurance that there is no increased risk. An important 
caveat exists that the median interval between index cancer and recommencement of 
immunosuppression in our cohort was 6 years and thus it cannot be robustly concluded that 
re-initiation of immunosuppression before the recommended 5 year interval is safe in all 
patients. However, a stratified analysis among studies where the median interval was shorter 
than 6 years revealed no difference in risk of new or recurrent cancers. As data becomes

 increasingly available, guidelines may ease the recommendation on restricting 
immunosuppression in this population also at risk for progressive damage from their 
inflammatory disease. In the meantime, one can continue to exercise caution in those with a 
very recent history of cancer, particularly those with high-risk index cancer. However, in a 
subset of patients, a shorter window of interval may be sufficient without increasing risk of 
adverse outcomes.
We readily acknowledge several limitations to this meta-analysis. There was significant 
heterogeneity between the studies and 3 of the included studies had fewer than 20 patients. 
Post-hoc power calculated revealed an 84% power to detect a statistically significant 
difference between the no IS and IMM group and 81% power to detect a difference between 
the anti-TNF and no IS groups. The process for detecting cancer recurrence was not uniform 
across the studies and may have resulted in missed cases. There was also significant 
variation among the cancers included as the index malignancy. Some studies were restricted 
to specific index cancers (for example, skin, breast), others included all prior cancer, while 
yet others included only prior solid organ or hematologic malignancies. It is also possible 
that patients on immunosuppression are under closer follow-up leading to a bias with a 
higher cancer rate than among controls. Person-time exposure was presented from the date 
of diagnosis of index cancer in most studies rather than from time to re-initiation of 
immunosuppressive therapy. However, the latter approach would also be susceptible to bias 
as time to re-initiation may be influenced by risk of recurrence over time. We were unable to 
calculate the effect of dose of immunosuppression or duration of exposure on the risk of 
recurrence and there were varying intervals between prior cancer and recommencement of 
immunosuppressive therapy. We also could not examine the impact of immunosuppression 
use prior to the development of the index cancer. As noted above, whether there are absolute 
or relative differences between each therapy and specific cancers could not be examined. It 
is also possible, and likely, that patients who were at high risk for recurrence were not 
recommenced on immunosuppression and consequently our findings may be more 
applicable to a population where the patient and physicians were comfortable with re-
initiation of therapy. While pharmaco-epidemiologic studies of drug safety have traditionally 
relied on a new user design, such analyses were not possible in our study. However, for 
outcomes such as malignancy where a prolonged exposure to treatment is required for an 
elevation in risk, a new user design may not be feasible given the challenges in following 
large cohorts of patients for prolonged periods of time. The median follow-up in several 
studies was shorter than 36 months and though the risk of recurrence is highest soon after 
index cancer, the effect of immunosuppression on delayed recurrent or new primary cancer 
could not be examined.
In conclusion, treatment decisions following a cancer diagnosis are complex and must take 
into account the natural history of cancer, histological type and stage, time from diagnosis 
and course of underlying chronic inflammatory disease. Our findings suggest that anti-TNF 
therapy, conventional immunosuppressant therapy, or combination immunosuppression are 
not associated with increased risk of cancer recurrence in this population. However, there is 
a need for larger studies to prospectively monitor for cancer recurrence and new 
malignancies in this population to better inform our practice.
