Abstract
The immune privileged nature of the CNS can make it vulnerable to chronic and latent infec-
tions. Little is known about the effects of lifelong brain infections, and thus inflammation, on
the neurological health of the host. Toxoplasma gondii is a parasite that can infect any mam-
malian nucleated cell with average worldwide seroprevalence rates of 30%. Infection by
Toxoplasma is characterized by the lifelong presence of parasitic cysts within neurons in
the brain, requiring a competent immune system to prevent parasite reactivation and
encephalitis. In the immunocompetent individual, Toxoplasma infection is largely asymp-
tomatic, however many recent studies suggest a strong correlation with certain neurode-
generative and psychiatric disorders. Here, we demonstrate a significant reduction in the
primary astrocytic glutamate transporter, GLT-1, following infection with Toxoplasma. Using
microdialysis of the murine frontal cortex over the course of infection, a significant increase
in extracellular concentrations of glutamate is observed. Consistent with glutamate dysre-
gulation, analysis of neurons reveal changes in morphology including a reduction in den-
dritic spines, VGlut1 and NeuN immunoreactivity. Furthermore, behavioral testing and EEG
recordings point to significant changes in neuronal output. Finally, these changes in neuro-
nal connectivity are dependent on infection-induced downregulation of GLT-1 as treatment
with the ß-lactam antibiotic ceftriaxone, rescues extracellular glutamate concentrations,
neuronal pathology and function. Altogether, these data demonstrate that following an infec-
tion with T. gondii, the delicate regulation of glutamate by astrocytes is disrupted and
accounts for a range of deficits observed in chronic infection.

 Author Summary
The protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii infects a third of the world’s population and
causes a chronic lifelong infection in the brain of the host. The consequences of such an
infection are poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that Toxoplasma infection can
induce profound changes in astrocyte physiology leading to significant disruption of neu-
ronal networks. Pathology can be rescued by upregulating the astrocytic glutamate trans-
porter, GLT-1, restoring concentrations of extracellular glutamate and EEG power. We
suggest that such global dysregulation of neurotransmitters should be considered when
determining the effects of infection on the CNS.
Introduction
The balancing act required to fight infection while maintaining tissue homeostasis is perhaps
no more critical than in the CNS. Here, the physical restraints imposed by the skull and blood
brain barrier alongside low MHC expression and a lack of circulating lymphocytes can delay
and limit the immune response. However, perhaps due to these properties, many infectious
agents target or localize to the brain [1]. These include bacterial, viral and parasitic pathogens.
In many cases, such infections are chronic and require immune competency to remain latent
[2–4]. We have only nominal understanding of the effects of continuous immune reactivity in
a tissue that is designed to keep such responses to a minimum.
Recently, the concept that infections can have a profound and lasting effect on brain func-
tion and even host behavior has gained momentum [1, 3, 4]. In the case of the protozoan para-
site Toxoplasma gondii, this lifelong infection resides predominantly as latent cysts inside
neurons and requires continuous infiltration of lymphocytes to the brain to prevent parasite
reactivation and fatal encephalitis [2, 5]. Furthermore, this is not a selective parasite: Toxo-
plasma is one of the most successful pathogens on the planet infecting approximately a third of
the world’s population with prevalence rates in Europe and the USA between 15–80% [6].
Although infection is common, disease induced by Toxoplasma is rare and with few exceptions
has only been associated with individuals that have profound defects in their immune system.
However, in recent years, interest has focused on the potential relationship of infection with
Toxoplasma on neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders. Infection with Toxoplasma has
been suggested to be a significant risk factor in Parkinson’s [7], Alzheimer’s (AD) [8], mania
[9] and Schizophrenia [10–12] and is correlated with specific changes in murine [13–15] and
human behavior [16, 17]. The range of severity and the variety of disease associated with Toxo-
plasma infection suggest the potential for global, as well as specific, alterations in neuronal net-
works and signaling.
Glutamate is arguably the most important neurotransmitter in the brain and unregulated
levels can cause neuroexcitotoxicity; therefore, CNS glutamate is strictly controlled. Although
glutamate is readily available in the periphery, it does not cross the BBB and is thus virtually
completely synthesized de-novo within the CNS, primarily by astrocytes [18–20], with neurons
able to catalyze glutamine to glutamate through glutaminase. Astrocytes have the important
job of regulating CNS glutamate by adjusting uptake, release, synthesis into glutamine, and
synthesis from α-ketoglutarate or lactate/alanine [18–21]. These cells play an active role in con-
trolling Toxoplasma infection with the ability to up-regulate pro-inflammatory cytokines,
secrete chemoattractants and internally kill parasites via IGTP [22–24]. However, observations
of astrocytic swelling during infection [25] may point to significant changes in astrocyte physi-
ology. Such changes in astrocyte activation and morphology have been linked to dysregulation

 in glutamate metabolism either via slowing glutamate clearance or dumping of glutamate into
the extracellular space (ECS)[26–32]. The implications of glutamate excitotoxicity are broad.
Traditionally, elevated extracellular glutamate concentrations have been observed under acute
CNS insults such as ischemia [33, 34] and traumatic brain injury [35, 36]. However, many
studies have associated elevated ECS glutamate concentrations with neurodegenerative disor-
ders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) [37], multiple sclerosis (MS) [38], Alzheimer’s
disease [39, 40] and with CNS infections such as cerebral malaria (CM) [41]. Understanding
the mechanisms that underlie elevated ECS concentrations of glutamate following CNS insults
is critical in developing preventative measures to avoid neuronal death. If there are changes in
glutamate concentrations, then this could lead to major changes in neuronal biology in the
brain.
In these studies, we use microdialysis in the preferentially infected frontal cortex to directly
collect and measure extracellular concentrations of glutamate. Although cells may contain high
levels of intracellular glutamate, it is the increase in extracellular glutamate that can cause neu-
ronal damage. We demonstrate that during infection with Toxoplasma, astrocyte glutamate
regulation is disrupted and CNS extracellular levels of glutamate reach non-homeostatic
ranges. Consistent with a dysregulation of glutamate, we reveal a pattern of neurological dam-
age including decreases in ß-III tubulin, VGlut1 expression, density of dendritic spines and
functional output as measured by EEG analysis. Thus, this infection, and the resulting inflam-
mation, leads to dysregulation of glutamate control by astrocytes resulting in neuronal pathol-
ogy and previously undocumented loss of EEG power. Finally, damage to neuronal health is
rescued by upregulation of the glutamate transporter GLT-1 following the administration of
ceftriaxone. The significance of these results suggest that in contrast to assuming chronic Toxo-
plasma infection as quiescent and benign, we should be aware of the significant risk to normal
neurological pathways and changes in brain chemistry.
Results
Infection induces chronic astrocytic morphological and molecular
changes
Astrocyte activation has been previously observed following Toxoplasma infection, and indeed
occurs prior to the entry of parasites to the brain [25, 42, 43]. To further assess astrocytic health
during chronic infection, a series of morphological and molecular analyses were performed. To
quantify the degree of morphological change and examine the kinetics of this response, astro-
cytic endfeet from the prefrontal cortex were analyzed from serial transmission electron
microscopy images from mice infected with Toxoplasma over the course of chronic infection.
The beginning of the chronic stage of infection is characterized by an increase in cyst burden,
CNS inflammation, and a decrease in the free tachyzoite form of the parasite and occurs
around the third week post infection. Sites of infection are unevenly distributed in the brain,
therefore we sampled at least 10 different areas throughout the frontal cortex. On at least one
occasion a cyst was observed where the surrounding tissue is clearly distorted (Figs 1A and
S1), otherwise endfoot measurements were made independent of parasite location. For fre-
quent and consistent measurements, astrocytic processes enveloping only blood capillaries
(~5 μm in diameter) were sampled. In the naïve brain, astrocytic endfeet are on average less
than 0.5μm wide (Figs 1A and S1)[44]. By 3 weeks post-infection, astrocytic endfeet are
already significantly swollen. At 6 weeks post infection, well into the chronic phase, cyst burden
has reached a plateau [45], and the immune response and parasite reactivation have reached a
stable balance [25]. Here, astrocytic endfeet width peaks to almost 6 fold higher than naïve
(2.606± 0.1021μm; p<0.0001) (Figs 1A and S1). The balance between cyst burden and the

 immune response is maintained for the remainder of the host’s life. To test if astrocytic endfeet
remain swollen, endfeet were measured at 12 weeks post infection, late in the chronic phase
[25]. Although the endfeet width decreases to 1.562± 0.0840μm, they remain significantly swol-
len compared to naïve animals (p<0.0001) (Figs 1A and S1). This supports the previously
observed swelling of astrocytes following infection, but in addition demonstrates that this is a

 chronic and sustained state pointing instead to a hypertrophic condition rather than transient
swelling.
This type of change in morphology is frequently indicative of significant changes in the
molecular and functional role of these cells. One of the major roles of astrocytes is to remove
extracellular glutamate to prevent neuroexcitotoxicity [21]. In the brain, all glutamate is syn-
thesized de-novo as no transporters exist on the BBB to facilitate entry of glutamate from the
blood [18]. Glutamate is then released at presynaptic sites during synaptic transmission. This
extracellular glutamate is regulated by the actions of specific transporters present on astrocytes.
The main astrocytic glutamate transporter in the forebrain is GLT-1, with GLAST playing a
less significant role [20]. Once glutamate is taken up by the astrocyte, glutamine synthetase
(GS) converts a portion to glutamine, which can then be safely released back to neurons for
conversion to glutamate. Although peripheral inflammatory events including the circulation of
high concentrations of the cytokines IFN-γ and TNF-α are already occurring one-week post
infection, GS and GLAST transcripts are not significantly different than naïve levels and
GLAST transcription remains unaltered (Fig 1B). At 2 weeks post infection, coincident with
parasites entering the CNS, a decrease in GS transcripts is observed. This reduction is main-
tained throughout the chronic and late chronic stages of infection. In contrast, GLT-1 tran-
scripts are significantly reduced at day 7 and continue to decline over the course of infection
(Fig 1B). These data point to a major defect in the ability of astrocytes to regulate extracellular
glutamate concentrations throughout chronic infection.
Toxoplasma infection causes significant neuronal pathology
The prefrontal cortex plays a large role in innate fear, anxiety and decision-making and is also
the area of the brain most densely infected and a significant site of inflammation [46–50]. To
understand the root of behavioral changes induced by infection, the prefrontal cortex was
examined at 6 weeks post infection, for changes in neuronal morphology associated with exci-
totoxicity [47]. Immunohistochemistry staining for ß-III tubulin, a cytoskeleton component of
neurons, reveals a disruption in neuronal structure. Mice infected with Toxoplasma exhibit sig-
nificantly fewer ß-III tubulin positive cells (p = 0.0012) (Fig 2A). To test if this lack of ß-III
tubulin was due to the absence of neurons and therefore neuronal death or merely an indicator
of poor neuronal health, Nissl staining was performed. Neuronal counts in layer II/III of the
prefrontal cortex of naïve (n = 1982 neurons) and infected (n = 2073 neurons) brains reveal no
significant differences in neuron density, suggesting little induction of cell death (p = 0.132)
(Fig 2B). Structures susceptible to excitatory damage but critical for neuronal function include
dendritic spines: the postsynaptic sites of excitatory synapses. To test if synaptic changes in the
frontal cortex take place during infection with Toxoplasma, labeling of dendritic spines was
performed using the lipophilic dye, DiI delivered on tungsten particles by gene gun. Secondary
dendrites in layers II/III and IV were randomly selected from serial sections of the frontal cor-
tex and spines counted blindly. Infection with Toxoplasma significantly reduces spine density
in 6 week infected C57BL/6 mice compared to naïve, uninfected age-matched controls
(infected = 5.510±0.2474 spines per 10 μm and naive = 6.456±0.2122 spines per 10 μm;
p = 0.0046) (Fig 2C). Such changes are on par with neurodisorders such as Autism spectrum
and Fragile X, disease conditions that are associated with a loss of synapses in the brain con-
tributing to impaired cognitive abilities [51–53]. To further test the extent of synaptic loss, IHC
staining for the excitatory presynaptic marker VGlut-1 was conducted and reveals a loss of
VGlut-1 positive presynaptic boutons in the cortex of chronically infected animals. Western
blot analysis of whole brain extracts supports such a downregulation, demonstrating a signifi-
cant decrease in the amount of VGlut-1 in infected animals (Fig 2D and 2E). These data

 demonstrate that although the infection is categorized as asymptomatic, with no neuronal
death observed, significant disruption in neuronal cytoskeleton and significant decreases in
excitatory synapses occur during the chronic phase of Toxoplasma infection.
Glutamate extracellular concentrations increase during infection
Global disruption of the cytoskeletal component β-III-tubulin and loss of dendritic spines may
be a result of glutamate excitotoxicity. Excitotoxicity occurs when extracellular levels of gluta-
mate increase to a pathological level, ~30μM is generally thought to be a threshold for pathol-
ogy with >50μM causing significant cell death. Although direct in vivo measurement of ECS
glutamate is rarely conducted [33, 39, 41], it is implicated in animal models of highly patholog-
ical and neurodegenerating diseases including multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
(ALS) [37–41] and epilepsy [54]. To measure extracellular levels of glutamate during infection
with Toxoplasma, 1mm long microdialysis probes were positioned in the frontal cortex of
C57BL/6 mice and the dialysate was collected from the same mouse cohort over the course of
infection including acutely at day 3, 7 and 10 days post infection and then weekly at day 14 for
a further 4 weeks with naïve, uninfected age matched controls sampled at each time point (N).
At the conclusion of the experiment, brains were harvested and histologically assessed for
appropriate probe positioning and signs of necrotic tissue, abscesses or hemorrhages (Fig 3A).
No necrosis or damage to tissue was observed other than that directly caused by probe place-
ment. Using LC-MS, the extracellular concentration of all 20 essential and non-essential amino
acids was measured. As a positive control, a separate cohort was injected intraperitoneally with
pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) (60mg/kg) and the dialysate collected. PTZ induces the depolarization
of neurons and can cause seizures at high doses; therefore, a spike in extracellular glutamate is
expected. Indeed, PTZ administration produced a large spike in both glutamate (E) and its ana-
logue aspartic acid (D) within 5 minutes of administration (Fig 3B, arrows) with little to no
changes in other amino acids demonstrating successful microdialysis and measurement of glu-
tamate in the murine frontal cortex.
Extracellular concentrations of amino acids were then measured following infection with
Toxoplasma and compared to values before infection. Glutamate concentrations remain low
and constant during the first 21 days however, consistent with our observations of astrocyte
and neuronal morphologies, a significant increase is observed at and after 28 days and contin-
ues to increase over the course of infection (Fig 3C)(one way ANOVA; p = 0.0003).
The dysregulation of glutamate can occur through a number of mechanisms. As we have
documented extreme sustained swelling of astrocytes, one of these mechanisms could be via
the opening of volume regulated anion channels (VRAC) and release of intracellular glutamate.
However, measurement of aspartate and glutamine, both of which would also be released
simultaneously through these channels, did not exhibit the same pattern of increasing concen-
trations and indeed remained relatively constant throughout infection suggesting that the non-
specific dumping of amino acids as would occur through VRACs is a less likely mechanism.
Further, glutamine is the most prevalent amino acid in the CNS and its extracellular concentra-
tion is not directly regulated by GLT-1, GS or GLAST. Although aspartate is co-transported
with glutamate, its extracellular levels can be maintained independently of GLT-1 and GLAST.

 Both glutamine and aspartate exhibit non significant changes during the course of infection
indicating that changes observed in glutamate are not due to an experimental artifact
(p = 0.2023, p = 0.2227 respectively). The remainder of the non-essential amino acids mostly
exhibited a U-shaped curve, with extracellular concentrations sharply increasing in early acute
infection, then decreasing back to naïve levels between days 10 and 28 only to increase again
during the chronic stage (Figs 3D and S2). Using a one-way ANOVA, significant kinetic
changes in extracellular levels of Tryptophan (p = 0.0071), Histidine (p = 0.0403), Lysine
(p = 0.0243), Phenylalanine (p = 0.0229), Proline (p = 0.0168), Serine (p = 0.04), Threonine
(p = 0.0052) and Tyrosine (p = 0.0149) were measured during the course of infection. A Dun-
nett’s post-test was performed for all timepoints against naïve concentrations and significance
shown as asterisks (Figs 3C, 3D and S2). One notable exception is arginine, which continu-
ously decreases during the course of infection (Fig 3D) (p<0.0001). Arginine is an important
substrate for anti-microbial factors including nitric oxide, which is readily made during infec-
tion with Toxoplasma. Essential amino acids show a similar U-shaped response (S2), which
suggest a global disruption of brain metabolism during the course of infection. To summarize,
measurement of ECS amino acids over the course of CNS Toxoplasma infection reveals signifi-
cant time dependent changes in concentrations. However, although well buffered during acute
systemic infection, we measure a specific and sustained increase in glutamate in the brain dur-
ing chronic infection. These data point to the downregulation of GLT-1 as a possible cause of
glutamate-induced excitotoxicity during infection.
Ceftriaxone does not alter the immune response to Toxoplasma infection
To determine the degree to which GLT-1 is responsible for the range of neurological patholo-
gies during Toxoplasma infection we tested the ability of the β-lactam antibiotic, ceftriaxone to
manipulate the expression of GLT-1 in vivo. There are now a number of pharmacological
agents that have been documented to increase GLT-1[55–57], however ceftriaxone is the most
well characterized and has been tested in mouse models of ALS [58] and is neuroprotective in a
variety of CNS injuries [59–61]. As with many antibiotics, ceftriaxone has also been reported
to have anti-inflammatory properties [62–64]. To test the effects of ceftriaxone on Toxoplasma
infection, we treated mice starting at 5 weeks post infection and sacrificed at either 6 weeks (1
week of treatment) or 8 weeks (3 weeks of treatment) post infection and compared inflamma-
tion and parasite burden to untreated infected control mice. There was no indication that cef-
triaxone inhibited parasite growth or survival, with treated and untreated mice exhibiting no
significant difference in parasite burden after one or three weeks of treatment (Student’s t-test:
infected vs. ceftriaxone wk1: p = 0.2522; wk3: p = 0.2024) (Fig 4A). In addition, growth of
tachyzoites in vitro was unaffected by ceftriaxone treatment (S3 Fig). No overt differences were
noted between the inflammatory infiltrates in the meninges and in the perivascular space of
the prefrontal cortex between mice treated with ceftriaxone and those of untreated mice (Fig
4C). As a more quantitative measure of inflammation, brain mononuclear cell extraction was
performed and immune cells counted; these typically include T-cells, macrophages and

 resident microglia. Mice treated with ceftriaxone exhibited a trend for a decrease in the number
of total immune cells after 1 week of treatment; however this never reached statistical signifi-
cance (Student’s t-test: infected vs. ceftriaxone p = 0.0826) and this trend was not maintained
after three weeks of treatment (p = 0.7794) (Fig 4B). Furthermore, flow cytometry analysis to
quantify the proportions of resident microglia and infiltrating macrophages, CD8+ and CD4+
T-cells, showed that ceftriaxone did not alter the composition of immune cells within the brain
(Fig 4D–4F). This indicates that treatment with ceftriaxone does not impair or enhance
immune cell infiltration in the CNS. Finally, to test if ceftriaxone inhibited the global astrocyte
and microglial activation typically seen during infection, brain slices were probed with the
microglial marker Iba-1 and antibodies to the astrocyte-specific filamentous protein, GFAP.
Both treated and untreated infected mice exhibited increased microglial and astrocytic activa-
tion consistent and normal for Toxoplasma infection (Fig 4G). Thus, although we cannot rule
out potential anti-inflammatory effects that we have not measured, we conclude that adminis-
tration of ceftriaxone induces minimal alteration of the immune response to Toxoplasma and
does not lead to changes in parasite burden.
Ceftriaxone increases GLT-1 and prevents infection-induced glutamate
dysregulation
To determine if ceftriaxone could rescue GLT-1 expression in Toxoplasma infected mice,
chronically infected C57BL/6 mice were treated, as before, with 200mg/kg i.p daily for one
week starting at 5 weeks post infection. At 6 weeks, brains were harvested to measure protein
expression of GLT-1. Mice infected with Toxoplasma exhibited a significant decrease in GLT-1
and GS protein compared to naïve mice (Fig 5A and 5B). These data corroborate the decrease
in GS and GLT-1 transcripts over the course of infection (Fig 1B). When treated with ceftriax-
one for one week, GLT-1 protein, but not GS, is partially rescued (Fig 5A and 5B), supporting
the specificity of ceftriaxone in regulating GLT-1 expression [58]. Immunohistochemistry for
GLT-1 on serial sagittal sections reveals large areas negative for GLT-1 in the pre-frontal cortex
of infected mice. Such patches were not associated with areas of cysts or individual parasites, as
seen by DAPI staining or anti-Toxoplasma staining (S4 Fig). Co-staining with GFAP is consis-
tent with downregulation of the transporter rather than astrocyte death. Following treatment
with ceftriaxone, these large GLT-1-negative patches are no longer observed in the infected tis-
sue (Fig 5C). Loss of GLT-1 is still observed in the more resistant BALB/c strain (S5 Fig) sug-
gesting that this is a common mechanism between mouse strains. Finally, to test whether the
rescue of GLT-1 expression could restore extracellular concentrations of glutamate during
infection, microdialysis was conducted on infected mice and infected mice treated with
Fig 4. Ceftriaxone does not alter the immune response to Toxoplasma infection. Treatment of infected mice with ceftriaxone

 ceftriaxone. Measurement of ECS concentrations of glutamate revealed that mice treated with
ceftriaxone have glutamate concentrations that significantly decreased from infected, untreated
mice and were no different from naïve uninfected mice (naïve (n = 4) vs infected (n = 6):
p = 0.0003; infected vs ceftriaxone (n = 3) p = 0.0072) (Fig 5D). Ceftriaxone treatment did not
affect ECS concentrations of glutamine further supporting the specificity of ceftriaxone action
(Fig 5D). Thus, treatment of infected mice with ceftriaxone is able to restore GLT-1 expression
and reduce ECS glutamate from pathological to normal concentrations in the infected frontal
cortex.
Ceftriaxone is neuroprotective during infection with Toxoplasma
The elevated levels of ECS glutamate observed during infection offer an explanation for the sig-
nificant changes in neuronal morphology. To assess the protective effects of ceftriaxone on
neuronal health during chronic infection, immunohistochemistry was performed for the neu-
ronal nucleic marker NeuN. A marked decrease in staining intensity was observed in chroni-
cally infected mice when compared to uninfected naïve control mice. Some areas of the cortex
were devoid of NeuN staining further supporting infection-induced damage to neurons (Fig
6A). Mice treated with ceftriaxone for one week did not exhibit reduced NeuN staining in any
cortical areas (Fig 6A). Higher magnification confocal imaging reveal significant differences in
the pattern of NeuN staining between naïve and infected animals. While NeuN is strongly posi-
tive in the nucleus of naïve neurons, it appears cytoplasmic and diffuse in the infected animals.
Treatment with ceftriaxone protects the loss of nuclear NeuN (Fig 6A).
To test if ceftriaxone can protect against synaptic loss in the frontal cortex, dendritic spine
labeling was performed. As before, infection with Toxoplasma significantly reduces spine den-
sity in six week infected C57BL/6 mice compared to naïve (infected = 5.573±0.2288 spines per
10 μm and naive = 6.724±0.2572 spines per 10 μm; p = 0.0052) (Fig 6B and 6C). In contrast,
ceftriaxone treated infected mice did not exhibit any significant change in spine density when
compared to naïve (ceftriaxone = 6.922±0.2904 spines per 10 μm and naive = 6.724±0.2572
spines per 10 μm; p = 0.2026) (Fig 6B and 6C), and have significantly more spines than
untreated infected mice (ceftriaxone = 6.922±0.2904 spines per 10 μm and infected = 5.573
±0.2288 spines per 10 μm; p = 0.0004) (Fig 6B and 6C). These data further demonstrate that
infection with Toxoplasma is damaging to neurons and that treatment with ceftriaxone is effec-
tive in restoring such damage.
Infection with Toxoplasma disrupts neuronal networks and changes
behavior
Our data are indicative of a global dysregulation of the main excitatory neurotransmitter in the
brain, which could translate to functional and behavioral abnormalities in infected mice. To
test whether changes in behavior are induced by chronic Toxoplasma infection, and if such
changes are dependent on glutamate dysregulation, mice were subjected to the elevated plus
maze anxiety test [13, 14, 65] (Fig 7A). Following six weeks of infection, the time mice spent in

 the open arm of the elevated maze was assessed and compared to uninfected naïve, and ceftri-
axone treated mice. Consistent with experiments conducted in rats [14] and mice [13],
untreated infected animals placed on an elevated plus maze spent significantly more time in
the open arms of the maze (p = 0.0002) (Fig 7B) and entered the open arms more frequently
(p = 0.0005) (Fig 7C). The observed increase in open arm activity is not due to an increase in
the general activity of infected mice as there were no differences in the distance travelled or
velocity compared to naïve mice (p = 0.9569 and p = 0.9561 respectively) (Fig 7D). More time
spent in the open arms suggest less anxiety. These data support similar studies [13, 14] and
point to parasite-induced dysregulation of anxiety behavior. Although ceftriaxone treatment
provided significant rescue of concentrations of glutamate and neuronal morphology, one
week of treatment failed to modify infection-induced changes in behavior (Fig 7A–7D).
A more direct and functional read out of glutamate regulation is the measurement of neuro-
nal activity. If glutamate is dysregulated on a global scale, then we would expect to see abnor-
malities in the collective firing of neurons. To test if the changes in behavior are paralleled by
changes in normal electrical activity of the brain, resting state EEGs were performed on unin-
fected, chronically infected and ceftriaxone treated mice. The EEG electrodes, placed in the
frontal cortex, measured brain activity for 24-hour periods allowing for a detailed analysis of
EEG waveform and power that reflects strength and synchronization of neuronal circuits. Due
to the technically challenging aspects of this experiment, ceftriaxone treatment began at 3
weeks post infection and continued throughout the experiment with analysis conducted at 4, 5
and 6 weeks post infection. Analysis of immune responses and parasite burden following this
altered treatment regime did not reveal any significant difference in parasite burden or immune
infiltrate between untreated and treated mice (S6). Following six weeks post infection; cortical
EEG rhythms clearly seen in naïve mice (Fig 7E, top) are disrupted in infected mice with a
reduction in amplitude and frequency (Fig 7E, middle) suggesting a reduction or perturbation
in synchronous neuronal firing. The degree of pattern in an EEG epoch can be quantitatively
measured using approximate entropy; this technique can quantify the level of unpredictability
in a time series, with larger values representing less regularity. In line with ceftriaxone’s neuro-
protective qualities and its rescue of dendritic spine density, treatment partially rescues this
EEG measure (naïve vs infected, p<0.0001; infected vs ceftriaxone, p = 0.0057; naïve vs ceftri-
axone, p = 0.0138) (Fig 7E and 7F). EEG power over the physiological frequency range was
then quantified as a measure of neuronal synchrony and normal brain function. A dramatic
loss in EEG power over all frequencies is observed at 4, 5 and 6 weeks post infection compared
to naïve (One way ANOVA: p<0.0001 Bonferroni’s post test: p<0.001 between naïve and
infected for week 4, 5 and 6) (Fig 7G and 7H). This loss in EEG power at week 6 is accompa-
nied by a reduction in characteristic frequency so that lower frequencies become dominant in
the Toxoplasma-infected state. When ceftriaxone is administered for one week, there is no res-
cue of EEG power and defects remain across all frequencies (One way ANOVA: week 4,
p<0.0001 Bonferroni’s post test not significant between infected vs ceftriaxone). However,
continued treatment with ceftriaxone partially rescues EEG power at week 5 (One way
ANOVA: week 5, p<0.0001 Bonferroni’s post test (infected vs ceftriaxone: p<0.001) and week

 6 post-infection (One way ANOVA: week 6, p<0.0001 Bonferroni’s post test (infected vs ceftri-
axone: p<0.05) (Fig 7G). Overall the ceftriaxone-treated group demonstrated EEG power
spectra at weeks 5 and 6 that were intermediate between naïve and infected, untreated mice
(Fig 7G, weeks 5 and 6). Although the ceftriaxone treated group is particularly variable, no sig-
nificant differences in power allocation were observed among all 3 groups across weeks 4, 5
and 6 weeks post infection (One way ANOVA) (Fig 7H). These data demonstrate that infec-
tion with Toxoplasma decreases electrical activity and neuronal connectivity within the frontal
cortex that can be partially rescued by prolonged ceftriaxone treatment.
Discussion
In this report, we set out to characterize CNS pathology and its effect on normal brain function
during Toxoplasma infection. We have demonstrated that during chronic infection, when the
parasite and inflammation have reached equilibrium, there is sustained neuronal pathology
that manifests as an alteration in neuronal connectivity and output. We further show that this
pathology is at least in part dependent on the dysregulation of the primary neurotransmitter
glutamate, and can be rescued by ceftriaxone treatment and upregulation of the glutamate
transporter GLT-1.
These data suggest that although infected mice are outwardly indistinguishable from their
naïve counterparts, chronic CNS pathology is present. Microdialysis experiments reveal
dynamic changes in ECS amino acids during the course of infection, including a robust
increase in ECS glutamate concentration. The specificity of glutamate synthesis and regulation
by astrocytes leaves the CNS vulnerable to excitotoxicity by lack of compensatory mechanisms
to regulate glutamate. This evidently occurs during CNS injuries, infections and neurodegener-
ative diseases, as several are characterized by an increase in CNS extracellular glutamate [33,
35–41]. ECS glutamate can reach excitotoxic levels either by decreased glutamate uptake,
increased secretion during neuronal transmission, or both. During Toxoplasma infection, a
decrease in expression of GLT-1 leads to an increase in ECS glutamate which may be exacer-
bated by increased glutamate release through the glutamate/cysteine antiporter xc- system
expressed by microglia and other cells in the CNS during inflammatory events [66–69]. Our
data suggest that restoring glutamate regulation by increasing GLT-1 levels returns glutamate
concentrations to that of uninfected controls and rescues much of the neuronal pathology
observed. There are limitations to pharmacologically increasing GLT-1, as the specificity of the
drug will always be hard to verify. Ceftriaxone has the potential to modulate the immune sys-
tem, however, we recorded no differences in immune cell numbers or parasite burden suggest-
ing that any anti-inflammatory effects of ceftriaxone were limited and not enough to prevent
parasite control. Furthermore, we not only demonstrate specific upregulation of GLT-1 by cef-
triaxone, but also restoration of extracellular glutamate to baseline levels. Thus, although there
may be multiple actions for ceftriaxone, our data suggest that the dominant effect is restoration
of extracellular glutamate.

 Cell-cell communication via gap junctions (astrocytes) and synapses (neurons) facilitate
CNS function while intimate feedback loops connect neuronal circuits. Therefore, our discov-
ery of a significant disruption in the regulation of the glutamate pathway could predict changes
in other neurotransmitters. Indeed, while contradictory reports exist for the ability of Toxo-
plasma to manipulate dopamine [70–72], recent work investigating GAD67 localization at the
presynaptic terminal demonstrates disruption in GABA signaling and a decrease in seizure
threshold [73]. Decreased inhibition and increased glutamatergic signaling is a clear pathway
to seizures and occurs in patients with Toxoplasmic encephalitis [74]. In addition, here we
demonstrate that network connectivity as measured by EEG is significantly reduced in a
chronic and controlled infection. Resting state EEG abnormalities have been detected in a vari-
ety of neurodevelopmental, psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders, such as autism spec-
trum disorders [71], bipolar disorder [75], schizophrenia [75], Huntington’s disease [76] and
Alzheimer’s disease [77]. In particular, in a variety of these studies, reduced EEG power indi-
cating reduced functional connectivity correlates with neurological and cognitive impairment.
Thus, reductions in EEG power as observed with Toxoplasma infection, in the frontal lobe in
particular are likely to correlate with frontal lobe cognitive dysfunction. Such cognitive deficits
have been widely reported in the human population [9, 78–81]. Experiments in mice have
demonstrated an effect of infection on olfaction and behavior towards bobcat urine [15]. The
mechanism, of what must be a highly specific modulation of neuronal activity has recently
been described as epigenetic control of the arginine vasopressin promoter of the amygdala
[82]. However, such specific alterations are less likely to lead to the wide range of human disor-
ders correlated with infection. Other more recent studies have described widespread changes
in neurons [83], pathology, and behavior [47, 50] including MRI analysis and loss of the synap-
tic marker PSD95, supporting the concept that connectivity and neuronal output is changed
[83]. Our study now adds to this by demonstrating a reduction in brain wave activity, dendritic
spine density and disruption of neuronal synaptic markers.
Our data suggest that the alterations in neuronal morphology and network activity is linked
to downregulation of GLT-1, as increasing GLT-1 expression via ceftriaxone treatment rescues
the majority of this pathology. However, recovery of GLT-1 expression and glutamate levels
failed to rescue the altered risk seeking behavior as measured by the elevated plus maze. This
could indicate that this particular behavior is independent of glutamate dysregulation. Perhaps
changes in other neurotransmitter systems—such as dopamine or GABA, play a larger role in
anxiety behavior which would not be restored by administration of ceftriaxone. Failure to res-
cue risk-seeking behavior could also suggest that ceftriaxone restores synapses to pre-infection
numbers but that the synaptic connections are remodeled. Future studies including a battery of
behavioral tests may be needed to determine the effects of glutamate dysregulation on behavior
during T. gondii infection.
Studies using mice heterozygous for GLT-1 in which protein expression is 45–60% less than
that of wild type exhibit enhanced protection during ischemia [34] suggesting loss of GLT-1
does not always lead to severe neurological disease. The caveats to this are the unknown com-
pensatory mechanisms that may be present when genetically manipulating GLT-1, however
the ability to buffer the system may depend on the context in which GLT-1 loss occurs, in our
case chronic infection, a less pathological initial insult than ischemia but continuous. It is also
interesting that GLT-1 heterozygous mice exhibit behavioral abnormalities similar to those
seen during Toxoplasma infection including lower anxiety responses [84], which may simply
reflect the importance of glutamate control in this specific network.
A primary area for future consideration is what initiates the downregulation of GLT-1 dur-
ing chronic Toxoplasma infection. Surprisingly, considering the importance of this transporter
to maintaining glutamate homeostasis, there is little understanding of the mechanisms that
Toxoplasma Disruption of Glutamate and Neuronal Function

 govern GLT-1 expression. Reports have documented the ability for nitric oxide, a molecule
that is certainly expressed during chronic Toxoplasma infection (66, 67), to induce GLT-1
downregulation [85, 86]. Although an increase in glutamate concentration is not apparent
until chronic time points, modification of GLT-1 transcripts are initiated much earlier when
systemic inflammatory responses will be detectable at the blood brain barrier interface. As
there seems to be a delay in changes in GLT-1 protein expression and glutamate concentrations
compared to transcription, it is possible that there is differential regulation of GLT-1 splice var-
iants [87, 88]. Also, immediate and subtle changes apparent during acute infection may not
materialize to changes at the protein level or extracellular glutamate concentrations for some
time. As GLT-1 is abundant in the brain, and we see loss occurring in patches, it seems likely
that glutamate uptake is only impaired at a certain ‘threshold’ level of GLT-1 protein
deficiency.
GLT-1 downregulation occurs in many disease states [33–40] and is therefore not unique to
Toxoplasma infection. However, the observation that GLT-1 loss occurs in patches suggests a
more focal source of downregulation than a circulating factor or general inflammation.
Although no direct correlation with parasite location was found, this is hard to rule out as a tis-
sue slice represents such a small area in time and space. Preliminary experiments using cultures
of primary astrocytes do suggest that direct parasite invasion could contribute to GLT-1 inhibi-
tion. As GLT-1 expression is reported to be regulated via NF-kappaB, a pathway that is a target
of parasite inhibition, there is a mechanistic avenue for this [89][90, 91]. Although direct para-
site infection and manipulation of host cell machinery is clearly a favored hypothesis, recent
work suggests that the frequency of astrocyte infection in vivo is extremely low [92]. Whether
those few infected astrocytes would be sufficient to trigger such a substantial downregulation
of GLT-1 seems unlikely and would indicate a very susceptible system. The more likely hypoth-
esis is that infection within neurons leads to a change in neuronal/astrocyte communication
[89]. Astrocytic expression of GLT-1 is dependent on the presence of neurons and continuous
feedback between these cells regulates its expression [93, 94]. New detailed analysis of cyst biol-
ogy reveals a far more active and variable bradyzoite population than previously appreciated
[45], giving the cyst greater potential to alter the host neuron and those cells in its vicinity.
Considering GLT-1 downregulation is apparent in many neurological diseases without the
presence of parasites, it is unlikely that direct parasite interaction is the only mechanism that
downregulates GLT-1 during infection. Instead, additional inflammatory mediators that are a
constant and necessary part of chronic Toxoplasma infection in the brain likely also play a role.
Future studies will address the degree to which Toxoplasma can manipulate GLT-1 expression
versus the innate astrocytic response to the ongoing inflammatory event. Clearly, the preva-
lence of Toxoplasma infection is far greater than the neurological diseases that have been linked
to it and so interpreting these data as altered neuropsychology and behavior in Toxoplasma-
infected people should be avoided, however, it is increasingly recognized that the nervous and
immune systems are intimately connected. The finding that chronic Toxoplasma infection in
the brain induces significant disruption of neurotransmitters may support the theory that such
an infection could trigger neurological disease in those already genetically predisposed.

sity of California, Riverside. All surgery was performed under isofluorane anesthesia, and all
efforts were made to minimize suffering. Female C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice were obtained

 from Jackson Laboratories and maintained in a pathogen free environment under IACUC
established protocols at the University of California Riverside.
Infections and treatments
Female C57BL/6 or BALB/c mice were infected intraperitoneally with 20 cysts of the Me49
strain in 200μl of sterile Na+/K+ balanced PBS. Ceftriaxone (TCI) was administered at 200mg/
kg intraperitoneally for between 7 and 21 days starting at day 35-post infection (or on occasion
day 21-post infection for EEG/microdialysis experiments) as specified. Care was taken in alter-
nating injection side each day. Age and sex matched control animals were injected with saline
and having received no antigen are termed “naïve” throughout. Saline injections were adminis-
tered to infected, untreated animals to control for ceftriaxone treatment.
Quantification of T.gondii burden
For in vivo analysis, half brains were homogenized and parasite burden was measured by
amplifying the T. gondii B1 gene by real-time PCR as previously described [95]. For in vitro
analysis human foreskin fibroblasts (HFF) were cultured in triplicate and infected at a MOI of
3:1. Uninvaded parasites were removed after 3hrs and cells were cultured for a further 24hrs.
Media was removed and cells were cultured for a further 24hrs with fresh media containing
various concentrations of ceftriaxone ranging from 0.1–1000μM. Infected cells were harvested
and RT-PCR was conducted for the Toxoplasma B1 gene.
Anesthesia and surgery
Mice were anesthetized in an induction box with 3.5% isofluorane and maintained with contin-
uous administration of 2.5% isofluorane through a nose cone. All surgeries were performed
prior to infection and mice allowed to recover for a minimum of 7 days before being infected.
Microdialysis.
For microdialysis experiments, uninfected mice were placed in a stereotaxic
frame and a 1.5 cm incision was made in order to expose the junction of the coronal and sagit-
tal sutures (bregma). A burr hole was made with a 1mm drill bit 2.58mm rostral and 1.5mm
lateral from bregma using a stereotaxic mouse atlas. A CMA 7 guide cannula (CMA P000137)
was then lowered 0.5mm ventrally and held in place with glass ionomer cement (CMA-72-
9168). Two additional holes were made on each lateral side of bregma using an anchor screw
drill bit (CMA 8003264) to place 2 anchor screws (CMA 7431021) into the skull. The skull was
then roughened to allow optimal ionomer bonding by using a 1mm drill bit and gently scrap-
ing the entire skull surface around the anchor screws and the guide cannula. Finally, a tether
bolt (CMA 61–0037) was held in place while the ionomer cement was applied over the anchor
screws, tether bolt and guide cannula. The skin was then gently lifted over the cement and the
mouse was allowed to recover on a 38°C mat.
Electroencephalography. For electroencephalography (EEG) experiments, a burr hole
was made as described above at the same stereotaxic coordinates. A twisted bipolar stainless
steel bipolar electrode (Plastics One) was inserted 1mm under the dura mater and grounded to
the dura. The EEG implant was held in place with glass ionomer cement.
Electron microscopy
Female C57BL/6 mice infected with Me49 were sacrificed at 3, 6 and 12 weeks post infection
and perfused intra-cardiacally with 2.5% gluteraldehyde, 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 0.1M
sodium cacodylate buffer. Brains were removed and post-fixed in the same buffer. Serial elec-
tron microscopy of the frontal cortex of the brain was performed by Renovo Neural inc,

 (Cleveland, Ohio). 6–10 Z stacks from different areas of the frontal cortex of naïve and infected
mice (naïve n = 1; 3 weeks n = 3; 6 weeks n = 3; 12 weeks n = 2) were collected. Blood vessels
~5–6μm wide were selected (naïve n = 20; 3 weeks n = 75; 6 weeks n = 134; 12 weeks n = 82)
and average astrocyte endfeet width was quantified by measuring perivascular astrocyte area
and dividing by the blood vessel circumference using Fiji software. Significance was tested
using Student’s t-test.
Real Time PCR
Female C57BL/6 mice infected with Me49 were sacrificed at day 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42 and 56
post infection (n = 3 per timepoint), and perfused intra-cardically with sterile PBS. Brains were
removed and homogenized in TRIzol (Ambion). RNA was extracted using the TRIzol/ chloro-
form method and concentrations of nucleic acids were determined on a nanodrop 2000.

were as follows: 10 min at 45°C, followed by 2 min at 95°C and then 40 cycles of 5s at 95°C and
20s at 60°C. The GAPDH (Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase) forward primer
(50-AGGCCGGTGCTGAGTATGTC-30) and reverse primer (50-TGCCTGCTTCACCACC
TTCT-30) were used as an endogenous control. Quantified results represent the fold induction
of target gene expression using the differential CT method. NTC, no-template control (reagent
alone without template) was included in each assay to detect any possible contamination of the

Brains from naïve and 6-week infected C57BL/6 mice were homogenized in protein lysis buffer
with DTT and protease inhibitors using the Bullet Blender (Next Advance). Protein concentra-
tions were determined using a BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Scientific). 2μg (for GLT-1) or
5μg (for GS) was denatured at 95°C for 5 minutes in 2μl 10% SDS, 5μl loading buffer, and
topped off to 20μl with RIPA buffer. A 10% Tris-HCL gel (Bio-Rad), was loaded and run at 50–
100V in running buffer. The gel was transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane using the semi-
dry method in blotting buffer. The membrane was blocked for 1 hour in blocking buffer (5%w/
vol BSA, 1X TBST), washed in TBST and incubated with primary antibodies (Rabbit anti-Glu-
tamine Synthetase, Sigma at 1μg/ml; Rabbit anti-GLT-1, Thermo Scientific at 50ng/ml; Rabbit-
anti VGlut-1, Invitrogen at 2.5μg/ml) overnight at 4°C. The membrane was then washed in
TBST and incubated in secondary antibodies (0.4μg/ml; eBiosciences) and imaged on a fluores-
cent imager (Odyssey, LI-COR Biosciences).
Immunohistochemistry
Six week infected mice were sacrificed and perfused intra-cardically with PBS followed by 4%
PFA. A minimum of 3 biological replicates was used for each antibody combination and the
experiment performed at least three times. Brains were extracted, post-fixed overnight in 4%
PFA followed by a 3 day 30% sucrose equilibration. Brains were frozen at -80°C in optimal cut-
ting temperature compound (OCT). 10–15μm cryostat sections were then blocked with 10%

 donkey serum in PBS for 1 hour at room temperature. Primary antibodies against GLT-1,
GFAP, ß-III-Tubulin, Iba-1, NeuN, VGlut-1 and Toxoplasma (Rat anti-GFAP, Invitrogen used
at a final concentration of 5μg/ml; Rabbit anti-GLT-1, Thermo Scientific at 44ng/ml; Rabbit-
anti VGlut-1, Invitrogen at 2.5μg/ml; Chicken anti-ß-III-Tubulin, Chemicon at 0.8μg/ml;
Anti-NeuN, Abcam at 7.3μg/ml; Anti-Iba-1, Abcam at 35μg/ml; Rabbit-Anti-Toxoplasma,
Abcam at 50μg/ml) were incubated overnight at 4°C in 10% donkey serum and 0.5% Tween-20
in PBS. After several washes in PBST, the slices were incubated 3 hours at room temperature
with Alexa Fluor fluorescent secondary antibodies (4μg/ml; eBiosciences). Slices were then
washed and mounted with ProLong Gold (Molecular Probes).
ß-III tubulin quantification.
Serial 10-micron coronal pre-frontal cortex sections stained
for ß−III tubulin were imaged at 63X using a Zeiss 510 confocal microscope. 8 Micron thick Z-
stacks were imaged and positive cells counted using Volocity image analysis software.
VGlut1 quantification.
VGlut-1 puncta quantification: Serial 10-micron coronal pre-
frontal cortex sections stained for VGlut-1 were imaged at 63X using a Zeiss 510 confocal
microscope. 8 Micron thick Z-stacks were imaged and analyzed for puncta density using Volo-
city image analysis software. Western Blot analysis was performed as described above from
whole brain lysates.
Nissl staining.
40μm sections were cut and stained with Cresyl Violet Solution (IHC-
WORLD) as follows. Rehydrate slices in 1 min in 100% EtOH, 1 min in 95% EtOH, and 1 min in
distilled water. Stain with Cresyl Violet Solution for 6 min at room temperature then rinse in dis-
tilled water. Differentiate stain in 95% EtOH for 2 min and dehydrate slices in 2 changes of 100%
EtOH for 5 min each. The slices were then cleared in 2 changes of CitriSolv (Fisher) for 5 min
each and mounted. Nissl stained sections were imaged under 400X total magnification and
images of layer 2/3 of the prefrontal cortex were taken from serial sections. Neurons from naïve
(n = 35 ROIs each 150μm by 200μm, 1982 neurons) and infected (n = 34 ROIs each 150μm by
200μm, 2073 neurons) sections were counted manually using strict morphological guidelines.
Microdialysis
Surgery was performed as described above and mice allowed to recover for a minimum of 7 days
prior to infection. Microdialysis was performed on uninfected (N) and day 3, 7, 10, 14, 21, 28, 35
and 42 post-infection of C57BL/6 mice with a minimum of 4 mice per group. Naïve samples
were harvested prior to infection and throughout the course of infection to rule out changes in
baseline concentrations due to the presence of implants or age. No significant change in baseline
was recorded. In the case of ceftriaxone treatment microdialysis was started at 5 weeks post infec-
tion and measurements taken after 1 week of treatment (6 weeks post infection). Mice were
placed in microdialysis cages which allowed free movement and access to food and water. 1mm
CMA 7 probes (CMA 000082) were implanted through the guide cannula and hooked to a
microdialysis syringe pump. Artificial cerebral spinal fluid (CMA P000151) was perfused at a
flow rate of 0.6 μl/min and collected in a 1.5ml eppendorf tube. Mice were perfused for 5 hours
prior to sample collection to allow for equilibration of the CNS. Samples were collected over a 3
hour period and placed on dry ice. Samples were sent to Sussex Research Laboratories for amino
acid analysis via LC-MS. Data were analyzed using a one-way ANOVA followed by a Dunnett’s
post test for each timepoint against naïve concentrations of each amino acid. Results reported as
p-values for ANOVA and asterisks for the Dunnett’s multiple comparison tests.
Dendritic spine analysis
6 week infected; infected and ceftriaxone treated and age matched naïve (uninfected) C57BL/6
mice were sacrificed and perfused intracardically with PBS followed by 4% PFA. Brains were

 extracted and post-fixed 2 hours in 4% PFA, and stored in PBS. 100μm coronal section were
sliced using a vibratome and labeled using DiI coated tungsten particles administered through
a gene gun. Dendritic spines in layer 2/3 of the prefrontal cortex were imaged using a Zeiss 510
confocal microscope at a magnification of 63X. 15μm Z-stacks were obtained from 5 slices and
3–4 brains per group. For each hemisphere, 5 images were taken and all spines within those
images counted using Volocity 3D imager (Perkin Elmer), resulting in ~10 000 spines per
condition.
Electroencephalography recording and analysis
Mice were connected to the MP150 EEG recording module (Biopac Systems inc.) and EEG
traces recorded for 24 hours at a sampling rate of 4000 samples/ second using the AcqKnow-
ledge 4.4 software. Raw EEG traces were filtered using a digital FIR band pass filter between
0.8hz and 30Hz. A fast Fourier transform followed by a power spectrum density analysis was
performed to measure power over the set frequency range of 8–10 30-minute traces for each
experimental group. Percent power was calculated by dividing power at each frequency by total
power (area under curve) and multiplying by 100. At least 3 mice per group were used and the
experiment repeated twice. Data were analyzed using a one-way ANOVA followed by a Bon-
ferroni’s multiple comparison’s test. For entropy analysis, 7 filtered 2min traces for each group
were analyzed for approximate entropy using the following parameters: epoch: 2s; order (m): 2
and filtering level (r): 0.2. All analysis was performed on AcqKnowledge 4.4 software.
Behavioral experiments
Naïve (n = 13), 6 week infected (n = 11) and 6 week infected and treated with ceftriaxone for 1
week (n = 11) C57Bl/6 mice were placed at the center of a standard elevated plus maze and
recorded with an overhead camera for 5 minutes. Videos were analyzed blindly with Etho-
Watcher software; distance travelled and velocity was measured. Additionally, number of open
arm entries and time spent in the open arms of the elevated plus maze was measured.
Statistical analysis
Unless otherwise stated, Student’s t-test was used to determine significance between all
parametric data. The equality of variance between means was calculated with the F-test using
GraphPad Prism 6 software. A Dunnet’s post-test was used to test significance of amino acid
sampling over the course of infection with naïve, uninfected samples taken throughout the
time course. Bonferonni’s multiple comparison test was used to test significance of EEG power
analysis.
