In Brief
Medrihan et al. show that the initial
behavioral improvement induced by
SSRIs in the DG starts with the inhibition
of CCK neurons, which leads to a
disinhibition of PV neurons and a reduced
excitability of granule cells.

SUMMARY
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are
the most commonly used class of antidepressant
drugs, but the cellular and molecular mechanisms
by which their therapeutic action is initiated are
poorly understood. Here we show that serotonin
5-HT1B receptors in cholecystokinin (CCK) inhibitory
interneurons of the mammalian dentate gyrus (DG)
initiate the therapeutic response to antidepressants.
In these neurons, 5-HT1B receptors are expressed
presynaptically, and their activation inhibits GABA
release. Inhibition of GABA release from CCK neu-
rons disinhibits parvalbumin (PV) interneurons and,
as a consequence, reduces the neuronal activity of
the granule cells. Finally, inhibition of CCK neurons
mimics the antidepressant behavioral effects of
SSRIs, suggesting that these cells may represent a
novel cellular target for the development of fast-
acting antidepressant drugs.
INTRODUCTION
Major depressive disorder (MDD) represents a substantial global
burden, reportedly affecting 7% of the world population and
16% of the United States population (Levinstein and Samuels,
2014). The most common and effective drugs used for the treat-
ment of MDD are the selective serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine
[5-HT]) reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which act primarily by
blocking the reuptake of 5-HT from the synaptic cleft into the
presynaptic serotonergic nerve terminals, thereby increasing
serotonergic transmission (Rush et al., 2006; Trivedi et al.,
2006). 5-HT can activate seven families of 5-HT receptors
(5-HTRs) comprising 14 isoforms that are present in various
combinations in different neuronal types. With the exception of
the ionotropic 5-HT3, all 5-HTRs are metabotropic, coupled to
diverse G protein effectors, and have excitatory or inhibitory ac-
tions in different cell types (Hannon and Hoyer, 2008).
SSRI treatment suffers from a variety of drawbacks, most
notably a delay in the onset of therapeutic action (Quitkin et al.,
1984). Although the SSRIs have an immediate pharmacological
action, they reach their full antidepressant effect in patients
with a considerable delay, from weeks to months (Krishnan
and Nestler, 2008). Recent analyses of antidepressant response
to SSRIs have revealed early signs of clinical improvement (Post-
ernak and Zimmerman, 2005; Taylor et al., 2006). Moreover,
early improvement correlated well with the prediction of a
complete functional remission by antidepressant treatment
(Nierenberg et al., 2000; Stassen et al., 1996). Still, the lack of
knowledge concerning the cellular and molecular targets of the
SSRI response remains a major gap in MDD therapy.
The dentate gyrus (DG), a major target of serotonergic innerva-
tion (Leranth and Hajszan, 2007), has been implicated in the
response to SSRIs. SSRI treatment promotes a variety of synap-
tic, cellular, and network adaptations in the DG (Santarelli et al.,
2003; Shirayama et al., 2002). Moreover, 5-HT1ARs on granule
cells have recently been reported as essential for the chronic
response to fluoxetine (Samuels et al., 2015). However, little is
known about the 5-HTR isoforms expressed in the various cell
types in the DG and their contribution to the action of SSRIs.
The activity of the granule cells is under the tight control of two
classes of perisomatic GABAergic interneurons, parvalbumin
(PV)-expressing and cholecystokinin (CCK)-expressing neurons.
PV interneurons are fast-spiking neurons with high glutamatergic
input that modulate feedforward inhibition and control theta-
gamma oscillations, essential mechanisms for the processing
functions of the DG (Hu et al., 2014). CCK interneurons are reg-
ular-spiking neurons that are mainly involved in feedback inhibi-
tion. Unlike PV neurons, CCK neurons are highly modulated by
neurotransmitter systems associated with mood disorders,
including the serotonergic and the cholinergic systems (Arm-
strong and Soltesz, 2012; Bartos and Elgueta, 2012). DG CCK
neurons are innervated by fibers from serotonergic cells of the
raphe nucleus (Leranth and Hajszan, 2007), but how 5-HT and
SSRIs modulate the function of CCK neurons and how they are
involved in the antidepressant response are unknown.
RESULTS
5-HTRs on CCK Neurons Mediate Acute and Chronic
Antidepressant Responses
To identify the 5-HTR isoforms that are present on CCK hippo-
campal neurons, we used a translating ribosome affinity purifica-
tion (TRAP) approach, and we generated CCK-TRAP conditional

 knockin mice. To this end, we used mice bearing a loxP-
stop-loxP-EGFP-RPL10a sequence in the Eef1a1 promoter
(EEF1A1-LSL.EGFPL10) (Stanley et al., 2013), and we crossed
them with CCKCre mice. We validated the specificity and func-
tionality of the EGFP/RPL10a fusion protein in CCK-expressing
cells of the hippocampus (Figures 1A and 1B). Translational
profiling analysis revealed that CCK neurons express transcripts
of five 5-HTR proteins: 5-HT1B, 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C, 5-HT3a, and
5-HT5B. Among these, the mRNA levels of 5-HT1B, 5-HT2A,
and 5-HT5B receptors were highly expressed in CCK cells rela-
tive to the unbound fraction, which represented all hippocampal
cells, and they were highly abundant compared to the other
5-HTRs (Figure 1C). 5-HT3A receptor (5-HT3AR), previously
shown to be expressed in these cells (Tanaka et al., 2012), was
enriched in CCK cells, but its level was very low (Figure 1C).
We further confirmed the protein co-expression of 5-HT1B,
5-HT2A, and 5-HT5B receptors in DG CCK neurons by immuno-
histochemistry (Figure 1D).
We next studied the behavioral impact of these receptors in
CCK cells. To this end, we generated transgenic mice with con-
ditional deletions of 5-HT1B (5-HT1B conditional knockout
[cKO]), 5-HT2A (5-HT2A cKO), or 5-HT5B (5-HT5B cKO) recep-
tors from CCK cells, and we examined their hedonic and depres-
sive-like behavior in the sucrose preference test (SPT), forced
swim test (FST), tail suspension test (TST), and novelty sup-
pressed feeding test (NSF). None of the genotypes manifested
anhedonia (Figure 1E) or depressive-like behavior (Figures 1F–
1J). We next tested the behavioral response to the SSRI antide-
pressants fluoxetine (Flx) or citalopram (CIT) in two types of
regimens. In the acute response, animals were tested 15 min
after receiving one intraperitoneal injection of the SSRI. The
chronic regimen consisted of 18 days of treatment and ended
1 day before the behavioral tests. Flx was consumed in the
drinking water (Schmidt et al., 2012), whereas CIT was intraper-
itoneally injected. Acute administration of SSRIs reduced the
immobility of wild-type (WT) and 5-HT2A and 5-HT5B cKO
mice in both the FST (Figure 1F) and the TST (Figure 1G), but it
did not reduce the immobility of 5-HT1B cKOs in either test (Fig-
ures 1F and 1G). On the contrary, chronic SSRI treatment mark-
edly reduced the immobility of WT, 5-HT1B cKO, and 5-HT5B
cKO mice in the FST (Figure 1H) and of WT and 5-HT5B mice
in the TST (Figure 1I), but it failed to induce an improvement in
5-HT2A cKOs in either test (Figures 1H and 1I).
We next tested the effect of chronic Flx treatment on the
latency to approach a food pellet in the NSF. This test has
been used to measure the beneficial effects of chronic antide-
pressant treatment in the DG (Santarelli et al., 2003). Chronic
Flx treatment reduced the latency to approach the food pellet
of WT and 5-HT1B and 5-HT5B cKO mice, but not that of
5-HT2A cKOs (Figure 1J), consistent with the idea that 5-HT2A
receptors (5-HT2ARs) are essential for the delayed antidepres-
sant response.
Transcriptional Downregulation of 5-HT2AR Is
Associated with the Behavioral Response to Chronic
SSRI Treatment
We next measured the response to 5-HT in DG CCK neurons by
performing whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in hippocampal
slices. Application of 30 mM 5-HT produced a hyperpolarizing ef-
fect on the membrane potential of CCK neurons (Figures 2A and
2B; Figure S1A), which was completely blocked by pre-incuba-
tion of the slices with ketanserin (Ket, antagonist of 5-HT2AR),
suggesting that 5-HT2AR activation is sufficient to mediate the
observed hyperpolarizing response (Figures 2A and 2B). How-
ever, in slices from mice chronically treated with Flx, the
response to 5-HT was greatly reduced (Figures 2A and 2B).
In line with the literature (McCorvy and Roth, 2015), we
confirmed that 5-HT2ARs are Gq-coupled by blocking the
response to 5-HT with wortmannin (Figures S1B and S1C).

 inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels, a likely effector of
the Gq-signaling pathway (Figure S1D). Indeed, CCK neurons
showed a hyperpolarizing potassium current that was signifi-
cantly increased by 5-HT and was attenuated by Ba2+, a blocker
of the GIRK channels (Figure 2C). In slices from Flx-treated mice,
application of 5-HT failed to induce a significant increase in the
hyperpolarizing potassium current (Figure 2D), suggesting that
GIRK channels are the downstream effector of 5-HT2ARs and
that these receptors are downregulated by chronic Flx treat-
ment. To test this directly, we used 2,5-Dimethoxy-4-iodoam-
phetamine hydrochloride (DOI) hydrochloride, an agonist of the
5-HT2ARs. DOI induced a robust current response in CCK neu-
rons that was abolished after chronic Flx treatment (Figure 2E).
Immunofluorescence experiments confirmed a reduction in the
fraction of DG CCK neurons immunopositive for 5-HT2A after
chronic Flx treatment (Figures 2F and 2G). In line with this,
qPCR analysis of TRAP samples revealed a reduction in
5-HT2A mRNA level in hippocampal CCK neurons after chronic
Flx treatment relative to that in the vehicle group. A reduction
was also detected in 5-HT1B and 5-HT5B mRNA levels, sug-
gesting that these 5-HTRs are transcriptionally downregulated
by SSRIs (Figure 2H).
p11 in CCK Neurons of the Ventral DG Mediates the
Acute Behavioral Response to Antidepressants
Our previous work showed that the function of the 5-HT1B recep-
tor (5-HT1BR) is dependent on p11 (the protein product of the
gene S100A10) and that the interaction between the 5-HT1BR
and p11 is functionally relevant both for occluding depressive-
like behavior and for the antidepressant response (Svenningsson
et al., 2006; Virk et al., 2016). p11 was found to be highly enriched
in CCK neurons (Egeland et al., 2010). Constitutive deletion of
p11 results in both depressive-like behavior and a loss of antide-
pressant response (Egeland et al., 2010; Svenningsson et al.,
2006). In contrast, specific deletion of p11 in cholinergic neurons
of the nucleus accumbens leads to a depressive- and anhedonic-
like phenotype, but it does not impair the response to antidepres-
sant drugs (Warner-Schmidt et al., 2012).
We next tested the behavioral impact of p11 deletion specif-
ically from CCK neurons. p11 cKO mice did not show depres-
sive-like behavior in the TST or FST (Figures 3A and 3B). We
previously found that p11 interacts with 5-HT1B, 5-HT1D, and
5-HT4 receptors (Svenningsson et al., 2006; Warner-Schmidt
et al., 2009). Removing p11 from CCK neurons led to a loss of
the acute response to antidepressant drugs that target the sero-
tonergic system, but the response to the noradrenergic and
serotonergic agent mirtazapine was normal (Figures 3A and
3B), suggesting that p11 specifically initiates the response to
SSRIs in CCK cells. To validate the role of p11 in CCK cells of
the DG, the behavioral response to Flx was studied in CCK
p11 cKO mice in which p11 levels were restored in CCK cells
in the DG. To this end, we delivered AAV expressing a Cre-
dependent construct of p11 to CCK-immunopositive cells of
the ventral DG (DGv; Figure 3C). Reintroducing p11 in mature
CCK cells of the DGv restored the Flx response in the FST para-
digm (Figure 3D). Finally, to study the effect of induction of p11
levels in WT DG CCK cells on the behavioral response to Flx,
mice were tested after the transduction of p11 or YFP into
CCK cells of the DGv. As expected, WT mice injected with either
gene responded similarly to Flx (Figure 3E).
5-HT1BRs Inhibit GABA Release from CCK Neurons and
Modulate the Spiking Activity of DG Neurons
We next studied the role of the 5-HT1BR in mediating the
response to acute SSRI treatment in CCK neurons. 5-HT1BRs
are expressed in axon terminals (Boschert et al., 1994), and, as
expected, bath application of a 5-HT1BR agonist (CP93129,
10 mM) failed to induce a noticeable change in the CCK mem-
brane potential (Figure S2A). We next studied how GABA release
from CCK neurons onto granule cells (GCs) is modulated by
5-HT1BR. To this end, we performed paired recordings from
these two types of cells since it has been shown that these
two neurons are monosynaptically connected (Hefft and Jonas,
2005). Unitary GABAergic postsynaptic currents were evoked in
GCs by brief (1–2 ms) current injections into presynaptic CCK
neurons in the presence of glutamate receptor blockers. To

a hyperpolarization of the membrane potential (�5.02 ± 1.2 mV, n = 6 neurons/4 mice), but not when the slices were previously incubated with the 5-HT2AR
antagonist ketanserin (Ket, 20 mM) (�0.86 ± 0.13 mV, n = 3/2) or after the mice were treated with fluoxetine (Flx) for 18 days (1.50 ± 0.3, n = 7/3) (one-way ANOVA,

90.3 pA, n = 6/3), and the current was abolished by the successive application of 300 mM Ba2+, an antagonist of GIRK channels (one-way ANOVA, F [2, 19] =

 confirm the presynaptic site of action of 5-HT1BR, we used a
paired-pulse protocol in all experiments (Figure 4A). We
observed that the amplitude of the unitary GABA response was
increased by the addition of GR55562 (10 mM), a blocker of
5-HT1BR (Figure 4B). In line with the literature (Hefft and Jonas,
2005), CCK-GC synapses showed synaptic depression in the
paired-pulse protocol, and blocking 5-HT1BR further enhanced
the synaptic depression, suggesting that these receptors have a
presynaptic inhibitory role on the GABAergic output from CCK
neurons (Figure 4C). In the 5-HT1B cKO mice, the addition of
GR55562 did not change the amplitude of the first response or
the paired-pulse ratio in the same experimental paradigm (Fig-
ures 4D and 4E).
Importantly, paired recordings from p11 cKO mice showed
that the addition of GR55562 did not change the amplitude of
the first response or the paired-pulse ratio, suggesting that, in
the absence of p11, 5-HT1BRs in CCK neurons are not functional
(Figures 4F and 4G). In contrast, the deletion of p11 from CCK
neurons did not influence the response to 5-HT mediated by
5-HT2AR (Figures S3B and S3C). Moreover, the electrical prop-
erties of the neurons (Figures S3D–S3M) and the GABA/gluta-
mate responses of these cells (Figures S2E–S2H) were not
changed in the p11 cKO mice. We further confirmed the paired
recording results in all three genotypes by measuring the minia-
ture inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) in GCs, since it
has been shown that the majority of mIPSCs recorded in GCs
are generated by CCK neurons (Goswami et al., 2012) (Figures
S2B–S2D).
To investigate a possible molecular mechanism for the regula-
tion of 5-HT1BR function by p11, we used TRAP analysis. In
agreement with our previous studies showing that p11 regulates
the function, but not the level, of 5-HT1BR (Svenningsson et al.,
2006; Virk et al., 2016), we found that the translated mRNA level
of 5-HT1BR in CCK cells was unchanged in the hippocampus
from p11 cKO mice (Figure S3A).
It seems likely that the modulation of GABA release from CCK
neurons by 5-HT1BR would induce noticeable changes in the
DG network activity. To test this hypothesis, we performed in vivo
local field potential (LFP) recordings in the DG of urethane-anes-
thetized mice (Figure 4H; Figure S4A). We first measured the
action potential (spike) frequency in the DG, and we did not
notice any difference among WT, 5-HT2A cKO, 5-HT1B cKO,
and p11 cKO mice (Figure 4I). Moreover, an acute injection
with Flx (7.5 mg/kg) did not induce significant changes in spike
frequency in any of the tested genotypes (Figure 4I). Flx
injection did not alter the overall power spectral density, which
was severely decreased at all frequencies in the 5-HT2A cKO,
5-HT1B cKO, and p11 cKO mice compared to the WT mice (Fig-
ures S4B–S4E). Since we wanted to explore how Flx affects the
activity of the different neuronal populations of the DG, we iso-
lated, based on the width of the waveform, the narrow spikes
(coming from putative fast-spiking PV neurons) from the rest of
the other spikes (coming from the remaining inhibitory and excit-
atory neurons) (Figure 4J). The ratio between the narrow wave-
form and the total number of spikes was significantly increased
by the Flx injection only in WT and 5-HT2A cKO mice, but not
in 5-HT1B cKO or p11 cKO mice (Figure 4K). These results sug-
gest that presynaptic modulation of GABA release from CCK
neurons by 5-HT1BRs changes directly the activity of putative
PV DG neurons.
Chemogenetic Inhibition of CCK Neurons Reorganizes
Neuronal Firing in the DG
In addition to the direct inhibition of CCK neurons, Flx has been
shown to change the activity of other DG neurons that express
5-HTRs, for example, GCs (Samuels et al., 2015). To test whether
the increased activity of PV neurons by Flx is a direct result of the
acute inhibition of CCK neurons, we utilized a combination of
chemogenetics and in vivo high-density silicon-probe record-
ings. We injected Gi-coupled designer receptors exclusively acti-
vated by designer drugs (DREADD) viruses (hM4Di) into CCK
cells of the DGv (Figure 5A; Figures S5A–S5D), and we recorded
the firing of defined neuronal populations after an acute intraper-
itoneal injection of Clozapine-N-oxide (CNO, 1 mg/kg), the ligand
of the Gi DREADD receptor. Gi DREADD inhibits both presynaptic
and postsynaptic components of the target cells (Roth, 2016),
thus mimicking the inhibitory effects of 5-HT/SSRIs through
both 5-HT1B and 5-HT2ARs in CCK neurons.
Neurons were classified on the basis of the waveform features
of their spikes (Figure 5B; see the Supplemental Experimental
Procedures) into narrow and wide waveform neurons to separate
putative fast-spiking PV-positive neurons from other cell classes
in the hippocampus (Stark et al., 2013). Analysis of bursting, a
marker of internal firing dynamics that distinguishes wide wave-
form putative excitatory from inhibitory neurons in the DG (Sen-
zai and Buzsa
´ ki, 2017), further confirmed our classification.
Almost half of the wide waveform neurons (but none of the nar-
row waveform neurons) showed bursts (Figures S5E and S5F),
which confirmed that the latter group may represent putative
fast-spiking interneurons (Puig et al., 2008). All the neurons
that were inhibited by the injection of CNO (firing rate decreased
by more than 20% after injection) had wide waveforms, and,
within this group, we could further separate them into bursty
neurons, corresponding to GCs (Pernı
´a-Andrade and Jonas,
2014; Senzai and Buzsa
´ ki, 2017), or non-bursty neurons (Fig-
ure 5C). Interestingly, non-bursty wide waveform neurons all
had long refractory periods, a common characteristic of inter-
neurons, and narrower waveforms than bursty neurons, as re-
ported for CCK interneurons (Varga et al., 2015). The inhibition
of CCK-positive interneurons with CNO led to a significant

 increase in firing rate in the narrow waveform neurons (Figure 5C,
right panels), and the difference between pre- and post-CNO
firing rates was significantly higher for narrow than wide wave-
form neurons (Figure 5D). These data suggest that the inhibition
of DG CCK neurons alone is sufficient for a disinhibitory effect on
putative PV neurons.
Inhibition of CCK Neurons Disinhibits PV Neurons and
Induces Antidepressant Behavior
Our in vivo analysis suggested that the inhibition of DG CCK neu-
rons, although not changing the total frequency of spikes in the
DG, would favor a higher spiking frequency for fast-spiking inter-
neurons to the detriment of other neuronal types. To confirm this,
we next tested, in hippocampal slices, the changes in the firing of
morphologically and physiologically identified GCs and PV inter-
neurons (Figures S6A–S6F) induced by the inhibition of CCK
neurons with CNO. Bath addition of CNO (1 mM) significantly
increased the firing frequency of the PV cells (Figures 6A and
6B). The firing frequency of GCs was reduced by CNO (Figures
6A and 6B), presumably due to the increased activity of the inhib-
itory PV neurons. We further confirmed this effect by using
optogenetics, and we showed that halorhodopsin-mediated
inhibition of CCK neurons reduces the inhibitory input on PV neu-
rons but increases the net inhibitory input on GCs (Figures S6G–
S6K), probably due to the disinhibitory effect on PV cells.
To investigate whether the inhibition of DG CCK neurons might
cause a behavioral response, we tested mice injected bilaterally
with the Gi-DREADD virus into CCK cells of the DGv (Figure 6C).
CNO administration led to a significant reduction in the immo-
bility of mice in the FST paradigm (Figure 6D). Moreover, acute
treatment with Flx did not induce additional improvements in
the behavior of these mice (Figure 6D), strongly supporting the
idea that inhibition of CCK DGv neurons is sufficient for initiating
the beneficial response to antidepressants.
DISCUSSION
Our data describe two distinct mechanisms of SSRI action
dependent on different 5-HTRs expressed by CCK neurons,
one that mediates the initiation of the physiological and behav-
ioral responses and another that mediates the delayed compo-
nent of these responses. Recent studies reported distinct
5-HTRs on specific neurons involved in the chronic response
to antidepressants (Samuels et al., 2015; Schmidt et al., 2012).
We show here that CCK neurons in the DG are essential for the
initial SSRI response, and we describe the functional changes
in the DG microcircuit associated with this response.
Distinct 5-HTR Isoforms on CCK Neurons Mediate Acute
and Chronic Antidepressant Responses
5-HT1BRs are present in several brain regions associated with
anxiety and depressive illnesses, including the hippocampus, nu-
cleus accumbens, dorsal raphe, cingulate cortex, and amygdala
(Boschert et al., 1994; Carr and Lucki, 2011; Hannon and Hoyer,
2008). These receptors are localized on axonal terminals, and
they function either as autoreceptors in dorsal raphe projections,
controlling 5-HT release, or as heteroreceptors, modulating the
release of other neurotransmitters (Hannon and Hoyer, 2008).
Targeting 5-HT1BRs globally in mice decreases anxiety, but it
does not affect depression-like behaviors (Brunner et al., 1999).
Our current and previous work emphasizes specific roles of the
5-HT1BR as a heteroreceptor in different neuronal populations.
While deletion of 5-HT1BR from CCK neurons resulted in the
loss of response to acute SSRIs, these mice do not show depres-
sive- or anhedonic-like phenotypes. In contrast, the deletion of
5-HT1BR from cholinergic neurons leads to anhedonic-like
behavior (Virk et al., 2016). The function of 5-HT1BRs depends
on p11, a protein that interacts with these receptors and is highly
implicated in depression and response to SSRIs (Svenningsson
et al., 2006, 2013, 2014). We found that mice with conditional
deletions of either p11 or 5-HT1BR display similar behavioral
phenotypes. Deletion of p11 from cholinergic neurons led to
depressive- and anhedonic-like behaviors, but it had no effects
on the behavioral response to SSRIs (Warner-Schmidt et al.,
2012), whereas its deletion from CCK neurons affected the
response to SSRIs, but not hedonic and helplessness behaviors.
Interestingly, reintroduction of p11 into CCK cells in the ventral
hippocampus rescued the antidepressant response to SSRIs.

 We show here that the initial presence of 5-HT2ARs in DG CCK
neurons is essential for the behavioral response to chronic
SSRIs. Interestingly, the behavioral action of antidepressants
appears to require a reduction in 5-HT2ARs: chronic treatment
with tricyclic antidepressants, monoamine inhibitors, and some
SSRIs results in the downregulation of brain 5-HT2AR density
(Gray and Roth, 2001; Van Oekelen et al., 2003). 5-HT2A antag-
onists produce an antidepressant-like effect (Pehek et al., 2006),
and selective blockade of 5-HT2AR in patients enhances the Flx
response (Marek et al., 2005). Chronic treatment with Flx results
in the downregulation of 5-HT2AR mRNA and protein levels in
CCK neurons and, as a consequence, in a decrease of the inhib-
itory current that this receptor mediates. In addition to 5-HT2A,
both 5-HT1B and 5-HT5B receptors, which are highly expressed
in CCK cells, were transcriptionally downregulated after chronic
SSRI treatment. Our data strongly suggest that an initial
response to SSRI, followed by the transcriptional downregula-
tion of multiple presynaptic and postsynaptic 5-HTRs, is
required for the highly sensitive response of CCK cells to SSRIs.
In addition to 5-HT1B and 5-HT2ARs, our data show that
5-HT5B receptor (5-HT5BR) is highly expressed and transcrip-
tionally regulated by SSRIs in CCK neurons, but we could not
detect a functional role for this receptor in spite of its high abun-
dance in these cells. Interestingly, 5-HT5BR becomes a pseudo-
gene in primates and cannot be a therapeutic target in MDD
(Hannon and Hoyer, 2008). Using TRAP we also confirmed the
expression of mRNA for 5-HT3AR, a receptor previously impli-
cated in hippocampal CCK neuron function (Morales and Bloom,
1997). Our molecular and functional data suggest that the
expression level of 5-HT3AR in CCK DG cells is too low to
mediate a significant response to 5-HT. Our collective data
strongly suggest that 5-HT2A and 5-HT1BRs are the major tar-
gets of 5-HT and SSRIs in these cells. Interestingly, new studies
link variations in the human 5-HT2AR gene with the outcome of

 the antidepressant response (McMahon et al., 2006), and they
identify a possible association between a locus in the mouse
5-HT1BR gene and anxiety behavior in mice (Nicod et al., 2016).
Inhibition of CCK Neurons Induces an Acute
Antidepressant Response through the Disinhibition of
PV Neurons
Acute SSRI treatment induces an immediate antidepressant ef-
fect in rodents. However, even though some immediate positive
effects have been noticed in patients, these drugs reach their full
antidepressant effect only after a considerable delay (Krishnan
and Nestler, 2008). Our results show that acute antidepressant
effects are dependent on 5-HT1BR in CCK neurons, suggesting
that a cell-type-specific and 5-HTR isoform-specific approach
may enable the identification of fast-acting antidepressants.
5-HT2A and 5-HT1BRs act synergistically by inhibiting the firing
of CCK neurons and presynaptic GABA release, yet only 5-HT1B
seems to be essential for the acute antidepressant effect. One
possible explanation may be that CCK DG cells are innervated
by serotonergic fibers from the dorsal raphe nuclei that tend to
be thin axons with small varicosities and rely on volume trans-
mission, releasing 5-HT diffusely at non-synaptic sites (Leranth
and Hajszan, 2007). A second explanation may be that
5-HT2ARs are inactivated quickly after exposure to an agonist,
either through desensitization mediated by protein kinase C
(PKC) (Roth et al., 1995) and/or by internalization of the receptors
(Berry et al., 1996). Thus, SSRI-induced availability of 5-HT in the
proximity of CCK neurons will tend to activate 5-HT1BRs, which
in turn will act by inhibiting GABA release from CCK neurons.
Surprisingly, the inhibition of GABA release from CCK neurons
by Gi-DREADD did not lead to the expected increased firing of
GCs. In the DG, CCK neurons form synapses with both GC
and PV neurons (Armstrong and Soltesz, 2012; Bartos and
Elgueta, 2012), and we show here that the direct inhibition of
CCK neurons reduces the firing of GCs through the increased
activity of PV neurons. Chronic SSRI inhibition of GCs through
the 5-HT1A receptor has been shown to have an antidepressant
effect (Samuels et al., 2015). Thus, the indirect inhibition of the
firing of GCs through PV interneurons seems to be crucial for
the acute antidepressant effect, especially since PV neurons

 do not respond to 5-HT in basal conditions (Y.S., unpublished
data). PV neurons play an extremely important and immediate
role in the fast modulation of principal neurons in microcircuits
and the synchronization of neuronal networks (Hu et al., 2014),
and impairments in function of PV neurons have been widely
correlated
with
several
neuropsychiatric
diseases
(Marı
´n,
2012). Moreover, it was recently shown that, in a genetic mouse
model of depression, abnormal network oscillations leading to
the depressive phenotype are caused by defects in fast-spiking
PV neurons (Sauer et al., 2015). The increased GABAergic inhibi-
tion of GCs from PV neurons is in line with several reports
showing that the antidepressant drugs ultimately lead to
enhanced GABA levels in patients in both acute (Bhagwagar
et al., 2004) and chronic treatments (Luscher et al., 2011). These
results and the present data strongly suggest that the modula-
tion of interneurons may reflect a mechanism underlying the
immediate antidepressant response and that these cell- and
receptor-specific approaches may help in the development of
fast-acting antidepressants.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
All procedures were carried out in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals,
and were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committees of the Rockefeller University. Animals were maintained C57/Bl6N mice
and were housed in a 12 hr light/ dark interval with food and water ad-libitum. Male mice between 8 and 14 weeks of age were used for
all experiments. 5-HT1B floxed mice were previously described (Virk et al., 2016). 5-HT2A and 5-HT5B floxed mice were generated
by introducing flanked loxP sites in the promoter and exon 1 of htr2a and htr5b, respectively. Animals were crossed with CCKCre
(CCKtm1.1(cre)Zjh/J) mice. cKO mice were maintained Cre heterozygous/ floxed homozygous and, where appropriate, Cre negative
mice littermates were used as WT. The modified gene sequences were determined using Southern blot. Validation of the functionality
of the floxed mice was done by breeding them with NestinCre mice (B6.Cg(SJL)-TN (NesCre)1Kln). The resulting loss of mRNA expres-
sion of htr1b, htr2a and htr5b in Cre positive but not in the negative offspring was confirmed using semiquantitative qPCR. In some
optogenetic studies, heterozygous mice expressing Cre in parvalbumin cells (PVCre, Pvalbtm1(cre)Arbr/J) were used.
METHOD DETAILS
mRNA expression analysis
6 hippocampi from 3 mice were pooled per each translating ribosome affinity purification sample from fresh brains of CCKTRAP mice.
RNA isolation, cDNA amplification, qPCR and statistical analysis of mRNA level were done as previously described (Heiman et al.,
2008; Sagi et al., 2014; Virk et al., 2016).
Immunohistochemistry
Mouse perfusion and tissue processing were carried out as described (Sagi et al., 2014; Virk et al., 2016). Staining and analysis of
5-HT1B, 5-HT5B and 5-HT2A, were done for all samples at the same time using commercial antibodies against 5-HT1B (Thermo Sci-
entific, PA1-20650), 5-HT2A (Sigma, HPA014011), 5-HT5B (Sigma, SAB4503147), GFP (Abcam, Ab1218), p11 (R&D systems,
AF2377) and CCK (Acris, AP20643PU), whereas the fluorescent signals of YFP and mCherry were detected directly. 4 coronal sec-
tions of 80 mm thick were stained per antibody per mouse. For detection and determination of 5-HT1B in CCK cells, CCKTRAP mice
were intracerebrovascularly infused with 15 mg of colchicine 48 hr prior to the intracardial perfusion to inhibit the axonal transport of
5-HT1B. To quantify the number of +GFP cells co-expressing 5-HT2A, the pixel mean value of 5-HT2A inside a CCK cell was divided
by its level outside the cell, using a custom written MATLAB code. A total of 58-79 CCK+ cells of the sub-granular zone of the ventral
dentate gyrus were used per mouse. Cells with 5-HT2A mean pixel value above 140% of the background were considered
immunopositive.
Behavioral Procedures
All the behavioral tests were performed and analyzed by experimenters unaware of the genotype of the animals. Procedures were
performed as previously described: open field (Svenningsson et al., 2006), novelty suppressed feeding (Egeland et al., 2010; Virk
et al., 2016), forced swim test and tail suspension test (Virk et al., 2016; Warner-Schmidt et al., 2012). Cohorts of chronically treated
mice were used for multiple tests in the following order: Open field, novelty suppressed feeding and forced swim test, with at least
24 hr of interval between tests, whereas the cohorts of the acute treatment were only used for forced swim test. Chronic treatment
consisted of 18 days of free drinking of fluoxetine (0.167 mg/ml) / saccharine (1%) mixture or saccharine alone (as vehicle) as

 previously described (Schmidt et al., 2012). Chronic treatment with citalopram consisted of 18 days of intraperitoneal injection to
alternating sides of the abdomen. After chronic treatment, fluoxetine plasma level was quantified in some animals using high-perfor-
mance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and equally increased level was confirmed in all experimental groups.
Acute citalopram (10 mg/kg), fluoxetine (7.5 mg/kg), escitalopram, (10 mg/kg), imipramine, (10 mg/kg), mirtazapine, (10 mg/kg) or
saline (as vehicle) were administered intraperitoneally, 15 min before the test.
Slice preparation and electrophysiology
Mice between 8 and 12 weeks of age were euthanized with CO2. After decapitation and removal of the brains, transversal slices
(400 mm thickness) were cut using a Vibratome 1000 Plus (Leica Microsystems, USA) at 2�C in a NMDG-containing cutting solution
(in mM): 105 NMDG (N-Methyl-D-glucamine), 105 HCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.2 NaH2PO4, 26 NaHCO3, 25 Glucose, 10 MgSO4, 0.5 CaCl2,
5 L-Ascorbic Acid, 3 Sodium Pyruvate, 2 Thiourea (pH was around 7.4, with osmolarity of 295–305 mOsm). After cutting, slices
were left to recover for 15 min in the same cutting solution at 35�C and for 1 hr at room temperature (RT) in recording solution
(see below). Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were performed with a Multiclamp 700B/Digidata1550A system (Molecular Devices,
Sunnyvale CA, USA). EGFP-positive CCK neurons were selected for recording based on the expression of the fluorescent marker
using an upright Olympus BX51WI microscope equipped with the appropriate filters (Olympus, Japan) and a SPECTRA X LED light
engine (Lumencor, OR, USA). The extracellular solution used for recordings contained (in mM): 125 NaCl, 25 NaHCO3, 2.5 KCl, 1.25
NaH2PO4, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2 and 25 glucose (bubbled with 95% O2 and 5% CO2). The slice was placed in a recording chamber
(RC-27L, Warner Instruments, USA) and constantly perfused with oxygenated aCSF at 24�C (TC-324B, Warner Instruments, USA)
at a rate of 1.5–2.0 ml/min.
For measuring 5-HT or 5-HTRs agonist-induced responses, whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were obtained from GFP-positive
CCK neurons using recording pipettes (King Precision Glass, Inc, Glass type 8250) pulled in a horizontal pipette puller (Narishige) to a
resistance of 3–4 MU, filled with an internal solution containing (in mM): 126 K-gluconate, 4 NaCl, 1 MgSO4, 0.02 CaCl2, 0.1 BAPTA,
15 glucose, 5 HEPES, 3 ATP, 0.1 GTP (pH 7.3). 5-HT (30 mM), DOI (20 mM) or CP (10 mM) were applied in the bath using an automatic
valve MPS-2 multichannel perfusion system (World Precision Instruments, USA).
Miniature IPSCs were recorded in the presence of CNQX, AP-5 and TTX in a Cl�rich internal solution (in mM): 126 KCl, 4 NaCl,
1 MgSO4, 0.02 CaCl2, 0.1 BAPTA, 15 Glucose, 5 HEPES, 3 ATP and 0.1 GTP in which the pH was adjusted to 7.3 with KOH and
osmolarity was adjusted to 290 mosmol/l with sucrose.
For paired recordings the presynaptic CCK neurons were patched with the intracellular K-gluconate solution while the postsyn-
aptic granule cells were patched using the Cl�rich internal solution. The distance between neurons was between 50 and 100 mm.
Once a stable whole-cell configuration was achieved for both cells, steps of current of 1-2 nA for 2-5 ms were injected in the presyn-
aptic CCK neurons to elicit an action potential. The respective GABAergic response in the granule cells was recorded in the presence
of CNQX and AP-5. 50 responses were recorded for each pair of cells and the cells kept for analysis had at least a 20% response rate
in a time window of 15 ms following the CCK action potential.
Data were acquired at a sampling frequency of 50 kHz and filtered at 1 kHz and analyzed offline using pClamp10 software
(Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). All electrophysiological data are expressed as means ± SEM. Statistical analysis was per-
formed using the Student’s t test, One Way Analysis of Variance with Bonferroni post hoc comparison unless stated otherwise, with
the help of GraphPad Prism 5. In all experiments, p < 0.05 was considered significant.
In vivo single unit recordings
For unit recordings, animals were anesthetized by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of urethane (1mg/kg body weight). For craniotomy,
mice were mounted in a stereotaxic frame (David Kopf Instruments), in which the head of the animal was fixed with a pair of ear
bars and a perpendicular tooth bar. Body temperature was continuously monitored by a rectal thermometer and maintained at
33 C� ± 1 C� by placing the animal on a heating pad. Measurements were obtained from the ventral hippocampus, a region specif-
ically involved in mood disorders. Stereotaxic coordinates (in mm, anterioposterior [-2.92] measured from bregma; lateral [±2.00]
specified from midline;dorsoventral [-2.20] from surface of the brain) were set according to the Franklin and Paxinos Mouse Brain
atlas (3rd edition). Pipettes used for LFP recordings had tip resistances between 1–3 MOhm. A reference electrode was placed
on the skull close to the craniotomy window. Pipettes were gently inserted in the craniotomy window targeting the molecular layer
of the dentate gyrus in ventral hippocampus (AP –2.9 mm, L 2 mm, DV –2.2 mm). Positive pressure (100–200 mbar) was applied to
avoid pipette plugging. Pipettes contained Indian ink and the position of the electrodes in the hippocampus was evaluated after each
experiment. Data were acquired with a Multiclamp 700B/Digidata1550A system (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale CA, USA).
From the broadband recordings (1 Hz to 10 kHz), we extracted single spike activity and local field potentials (bandpass filter,
1–100 Hz). For the analysis of action potentials, LFP recordings were filtered offline between 300-5000 Hz and spikes were detected
with a threshold set sufficiently high above the noise level to avoid artificial triggers by noise peaks (5 X SD). For the spectral analysis
at different oscillation frequencies, data were first bandpass filtered at the specific frequency, then the power spectral density was
calculated. PSD was estimated separately for each mouse and respective oscillation frequency using 1 s time Hamming windows
with a 50% overlap at 1.22 Hz resolution [4096 points/fast Fourier transform (FFT) window]. Analysis was performed with Clampfit
(Molecular Devices, USA) and MATLAB Signal Processing Toolbox (Mathworks, USA).

 High-density silicone probes recordings
High density silicon probes with 4 shanks were used (Buzsaki32; NeuroNexus Inc.,USA) The shanks were 250 mm apart from each
other and bore 8 recording sites each (160 mm2 each site; 1-3 MU impedance) arranged in a staggered configuration with 20 mm ver-
tical separation. The probes were connected to a RHD 2132 amplifier board with 32 channels (Intan Technologies, USA), mounted on
a micromanipulator (Luigs & Neumann, Germany) and lowered into the DG of the urethane-anesthetized mice fixed on a stereotaxic
frame (see details above). Data were sampled at 20KHz. After a baseline recording of 20-30 min CNO (1mg/Kg) was injected
intraperitoneally.
Spike detection and sorting
For the spike detection the raw recordings were filtered between 800 and 6000 Hz. Candidate spikes were detected on each channel
individually as any event negatively deviating from baseline by more than 7 s.d. of the signal. Spikes were then realigned between
channels belonging to the same electrode group (the 8 recording sites from the same ‘shank’ of the silicon probe). Waveforms con-
sisted of 32 data samples (16 before and 16 after the minimal trough of the waveform) for each of the channels of an electrode group.
Each 32 points were then projected onto the first 3 principal components of all the detected spikes for a given channel. A waveform
was thus characterized by 3 (PC projection) by 8 (number of channel in one electrode group) data points. Spikes from one electrode
group from a given session were then clustered in the corresponding 24-dimensional space using KlustaKwik (Harris et al., 2000).
Spike clusters were then manually adjusted using the software Klusters (Hazan et al., 2006).
For the waveform classification spike waveforms were extracted from raw recordings, upsampled to 200kHz and were then band-
pass filtered (200-6000 Hz), a broader bandwidth than for spike detection to minimize spike distortion. The waveform of highest
amplitude (among all the channels of the electrode group) was averaged and two features were computed: trough-to-peak and
half-peak width, two relevant features of the intracellular spikes (McCormick et al., 1985). Narrow waveform neurons were classified
as neurons with half-peak smaller than 0.55ms and trough-to-peak smaller than 0.7ms; wide waveforms were classified as neurons
with half peaks longer than 0.6ms and trough-to-peak longer than 0.5ms. Neurons showing narrow waveforms are putative inhibitory
interneurons (Bartho
´ et al., 2004; McCormick et al., 1985). In particular, narrow waveform neurons are likely putative parvalbumin-
positive basket cells (Stark et al., 2013). For the bursting behavior, a cell was considered bursty if the distribution of inter-spike
intervals showed a peak between 1.5 and 8 ms.
Chemogenetic/Optogenetic recordings
For optogenetic studies, AAV9 coexpressing YFP and Halorhodopsin were injected to the ventral dentate gyrus (vDG, 1 mL to one
hemisphere) of mice of 8-12 weeks of age. For chemogenetic studies, rAAV2/hsyn-Dio-hM4D (Gi)-mCherry and control viruses
(1 ml/ hemisphere), were bilaterally injected to the ventral dentate gyrus of mice of 8-12 weeks of age. Coordinates for vDG, (for
p11, halorhodopsin and DREADD) were ± 2.00, �2.92 and �2.20 mm lateral, posterior and ventral relative to Bregma, according
to the Franklin and Paxinos Mouse Brain atlas (3rd edition). For p11 gene delivery, coordinates for vCA1 were: �3.01, �2.92,
�2.01, for dCA1: ± 0.50, �1.70, �1.22, and for dDG: ± 0.31, �1.70, �2.20, l.p.v. AAV expressing RFP and either Cre-dependent
p11 (2.4 X1012 U/ml, 1 mL per hemisphere) were a kind gift of Dr. Michael Kaplitt as previously described (Warner-Schmidt et al.,
2012). The number of subgranular zone CCK cells immunopositive for p11 was vDG, 762 ± 112; vCA1, 611 ± 79; dCA1, 811 ±
142; dDG 708 ± 137. Control mice were treated with YFP expressing viruses. Intraperitoneal clozapine-N-oxide (4 mg/Kg in saline)
was injected once daily for 10 days prior to the behavioral test. Animals were perfused after the behavioral studies and the expression
of the transgene was confirmed immunohistochemically.
For loose cell-attached recordings 2-3 MOhm pipettes filled with an internal K-gluconate solution were gently lowered on the sur-
face of GC or PV neurons recognized by their size, morphology and position in the dentate gyrus layers. A small suction was induced
untile the pipette resistance reached a 50 ± 10 MOhm resistance. Recordings in the voltage-clamp mode were performed if the loose
cell-attached configuration was maintained for 3-5 min without fluctuations in the resistance. CNO (1 mM) was added to the bath
perfusion system and was washed after 15 min of recordings.
Spontaneous IPSCs were recorded in granule cells in the presence of CNQX and AP-5 (to block glutamatergic transmission) in a
Cl�rich internal solution (in mM): 126 KCl, 4 NaCl, 1 MgSO4, 0.02 CaCl2, 0.1 BAPTA, 15 Glucose, 5 HEPES, 3 ATP and 0.1 GTP in
which the pH was adjusted to 7.3 with KOH and osmolarity was adjusted to 290 mosmol/l with sucrose. Field light stimulation of Halo-
expressing CCK or PV neurons was done through a 40x objective using a SPECTRA X LED light engine (Lumencor, OR, USA). Data
were acquired at a sampling frequency of 50 kHz, filtered at 1 kHz and analyzed offline using pClamp10 software (Molecular Devices,
Sunnyvale, CA, USA).
Statistical analysis
Unless mentioned otherwise, all data are expressed as means ± SEM. Statistical analysis was performed using the Student’s t test,
One Way Analysis of Variance or Two Way Analysis of Variance with Bonferroni post hoc comparison unless stated otherwise, with
the help of GraphPad Prism 5. In all experiments, p < 0.05 was considered significant.
