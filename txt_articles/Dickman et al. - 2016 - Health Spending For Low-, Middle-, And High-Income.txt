Abstract 
 
U.S. medical spending growth has slowed since 2004, coincident with rising co-payments and 
deductibles, which might particularly impact lower-income persons.  We analyzed 22 national 
surveys between 1963 and 2012 to assess trends in health expenditures by and on behalf of 
persons in each income quintile.  Before the 1965 passage of Medicare and Medicaid, the poorest 
quintile had the lowest expenditures, despite their worse health. By 1977 their expenditures 
exceeded those for other Americans (although after adjusting for age and health status the 
income-based gap never fully reversed). This pattern persisted until 2004.  Thereafter, 
expenditures fell 3.7% for the poorest quintile, while rising 12.5% for the middle-three quintiles 
and 19.7% for the wealthiest, who had the highest expenditures in 2012. The post-2004 
divergence of expenditure trends for the rich, middle-class and poor occurred only among the 
non-elderly. We conclude that the slowdown in health expenditure growth in the non-elderly has 
been driven primarily by lower spending among the poorest segment of the US population.

Introductioni 
 
U.S. medical spending growth, which for decades has outpaced Gross Domestic Product growth, 
slowed starting in 2004.1 Much discussion of the slowdown in health spending has focused on 
whether it is due primarily to structural or to cyclical factors,2-9
XX23456789and prior studies have attributed 
37% to 77% of the slowdown to the lingering effects of the Great Recession.2,8,9 These estimates 
imply that between one fourth and two-thirds of the spending slowdown may be due to durable 
changes in the health care system, such as improved provider efficiency or less rapid diffusion of 
expensive medical technology and pharmaceuticals.4 More recent health spending estimates 
suggest that the growth in health care spending has rebounded and may return to its high pre-
slowdown rate.10,11 Nevertheless, understanding the drivers and consequences of the pre- and 
post-recession health spending slowdown is a critical component of developing policies designed 
to increase value and ensure long-run sustainability in the health care system. 
 
Despite considerable attention paid to the relative balance of structural and cyclical factors in 
driving lower health spending, few if any studies have explored spending changes across the 
income distribution. Some structural drivers of slower health spending growth, such as decreased 
use of expensive “low-value” services (promoted, for example, by the Choosing Wisely 
campaign) could be expected to constrain health spending across all income groups. Others, such 
as cost-sharing (e.g., deductibles and co-payments) in private insurance plans, might affect price-
sensitive lower-income individuals preferentially. Similarly, recession-related cyclical factors 
might have caused greater slowing in health spending among those with lower incomes (a pattern 
that would mirror the trend in overall spending between 2008 and 2012, when inflation-adjusted 
consumption by the top 5% of income earners rose 17% but fell among the bottom 95%.)12  
 
Need plays a greater role in determining the consumption of medical care than for most goods 
and services. Moreover, health insurance has insulated most patients from the cost of their care, 
and Medicaid and Medicare have heavily subsidized care for the poor and elderly, who tend to

have the greatest health needs.13 However, recent increases in copayments and deductibles for 
the privately insured14,15 along with flat income growth among the non-wealthy16 may have 
constrained health spending overall and skewed it toward wealthier Americans. 
 
We used national survey data to analyze trends in health spending for different income groups 
over the past half century, with particular attention to the recent spending slowdown.

Methods 
 
Data sources 
 
We analyzed individual-level data from 22 nationally representative surveys of health 
expenditures by and on behalf of the civilian non-institutionalized U.S. population conducted 
over the past 50 years: the Surveys of Health Services Utilization and Expenditures (SHSUE), 
conducted in 1963 and 1970 (N = 7,759 and 11,619, respectively); the 1977 and 1980 National 
Medical Care Utilization and Expenditure Surveys (NMCUES) (N = 38,815 and 17,123, 
respectively); the 1987 National Medical Expenditure Survey (NMES) (N = 23,652); and the 
1996-2012 Medical Expenditure Panel Surveys (MEPS) (N = 21,571-37,418 per year), carried 
out annually by the Agency for Health Care Research and Quality. All of these surveys tabulated 
health expenditures (including all out-of-pocket and third-party payments) based on respondents 
reports, which surveyors then verified with providers. The surveys also collected demographic 
information, including income and family size.  
 
Analysis 
 
Our main analysis examined trends in mean per-capita health expenditure for each income 
quintile.  We also explored income-related trends according to payer, type of service and self-
reported health status.  Expenditure figures for all years were adjusted to 2012 dollars using the 
Consumer Price Index.17 
 
We divided the population in each survey year into income quintiles (i.e. fifths) based on family 
income as a percent of poverty.  We used the Census Bureau’s poverty measure, which 
standardizes for age and family size (and, in 1963 and 1970 only, for farm vs. non-farm status).  
Because of limitations in the 1977 data, for that year we calculated poverty levels standardized 
for family size but not age. In 2012, income quintile cut-points were at 125, 230, 361, and 558 
percent of the federal poverty level, corresponding to annual incomes for a family of three (two 
adults and one child) of $22,689, $41,820, $65,462, and $101,094. 
 
 8 
 
In addition to total health expenditures, we calculated estimates for five sub-categories of health 
services: inpatient care; outpatient care (including emergency care, and outpatient lab tests and 
imaging); dental care; prescription medicines; and other (including home health care, vision aids, 
and medical supplies).  Because expenditures for over-the-counter drugs were not included in the 
MEPS and the 1987 NMES, we also excluded such expenditures in analyses of the earlier 
surveys. 
 
We analyzed payments from six sources: private insurers; Medicare; Medicaid; other public 
payers (including worker’s compensation, VA, TRICARE, and other government sources); out-
of-pocket; and unclassified.  
 
We also analyzed income-related trends in self-reported health status (which correlates closely 
with more objective measures of health).18,19  MEPS respondents rated their health on a five 
point scale: excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor.  The earlier surveys used a four point scale: 
excellent, good, fair, or poor. To harmonize the scales, we recorded “very good” responses in the 
MEPS as half-way between “good” and “excellent.” We then calculated a mean health status 
score for each income quintile relative to the mean for the total population each year.  We 
explored different definitions of this variable, which yielded substantially similar results. 
 
We evaluated time trends in health spending according to family income quintile using linear 
regression. We chose 2004 as the start of the recent health spending slowdown based on prior 
national health spending tabulations.7 We conducted sensitivity analyses using cut-points 
between 2002 and 2006; the choice of year did not substantially change our estimates. 
 
We used multiple linear regression to adjust for health status (coded categorically on a five-point 
scale) and age (coded as a continuous variable,) where the bottom income quintile’s mean 
(unadjusted) health spending for each survey year was used as a reference group for the other 
four quintiles. Analyses with and without adjustment for age and health status yielded similar 
time trends; in most cases we report the unadjusted figures. (Detailed age- and health status-
adjusted estimates are available in Appendix Table 1.) Analyses were conducted for each data 
year and income quintile.  However, to smooth and simplify our visual presentation of the data, 
 9 
 
our graphs display two-year moving averages for 1996-2012 (the period for which annual data 
were available) and pool data for the middle three quintiles (which followed similar trends.) 
 
Finally, to assess whether a small number of very high-cost patients drove our findings, we 
repeated our analyses using quantile regression at the 50th, 75th, 90th, 95th and 97.5th percentiles of 
expenditures. 
  
All estimates incorporate person-level weights that allow extrapolation to the entire U.S. non-
institutionalized population. The 1963 SHSUE survey was a simple random sample, with each 
respondent having equal weight. For all other surveys we used SAS survey procedures that 
adjust confidence intervals for the complex survey design. 
 
Analyses were conducted using SAS version 9.3.

Results 
 
Per capita health expenditures grew 549% (adjusted for inflation) between 1963 and 2012 
(Figure 1.) As has been widely observed, spending rose rapidly between 1963 and 1987, surged 
again from 2000 through 2004, started slowing prior to the Great Recession, and slowed further 
during and after the recession. 
 
Expenditures for the poorest group grew more rapidly than for other Americans from 1963 
(before the implementation of Medicare and Medicaid) through 1987, while expenditure growth 
differed little amongst the top four quintiles.  By 1977, expenditures for the poorest quintile 
exceeded those for all other Americans by 23%. 
 
Between 2004 and 2012, per capita expenditures for the poorest quintile fell at a rate of $19.27 
annually, 3.7% over the 8 year period (Table 1).  Meanwhile, health expenditures for the 
wealthiest group have outpaced those of the three middle quintiles.  While per capita 
expenditures rose at a rate of $106.04 annually (19.7% over 8 years) for the wealthiest group, 
they increased only 12.5% during this period for the middle-three quintiles.  As a result, by 2012 
the top income quintile, which until the early 2000s had among the lowest per-capita health 
spending, had the highest expenditures of any income group. 
 
Individuals reporting worse health status had higher health expenditures (data not shown).  The 
lowest income quintile had the worst health status and the wealthiest the best throughout the 
study period (Appendix Figure 2), and shifts in health status did not explain the recent 
divergence in health expenditures between income groups.  Moreover, after adjustment for health 
status (and age) health expenditures were higher for the top income quintile than for less affluent 
Americans throughout the 50 year period (Figure 2).  In 2000, age- and health status-adjusted per 
capita health expenditures for individuals in the top quintile were $616 (18%) higher than for 
persons in the lowest quintile; the difference increased to $1,743 (43%) in 2012 (Appendix Table 
1). 
 
 11 
 
Expenditure trends differed markedly in the over- and under-65 age groups (Figure 2, Appendix 
Figure 1, and Appendix Table 2).  Post-2004, the elderly of all incomes experienced similar, flat 
expenditure growth, with the poorest fifth continuing to have the highest expenditures. In 
contrast, the non-elderly population experienced a sharp income-based divergence in expenditure 
growth after 2004; spending grew rapidly in the top income quintile, modestly in the middle 
three quintiles, and minimally among the poorest group. 
 
Prescription drug spending grew similarly for all income groups after 2004 (Table 1).  However, 
both inpatient and outpatient expenditures grew rapidly for the wealthiest quintile, while 
remaining flat or actually declining for the poorest group.  The income-related divergence in 
outpatient expenditures reflects both volume and price effects; wealthy individuals had both 
rising volumes of medical visits (Appendix Figure 3), and increasing payments per visit.  By 
2012, the top income quintile made 40% more outpatient visits per capita than other Americans, 
and costs per visit were also higher ($303 vs $241). 
 
After 2004, private insurance expenditures for different income groups diverged strikingly, rising 
rapidly for the wealthiest quintile, while falling for the poorest 20% (Table 1).  This was true 
whether average private insurance expenditure was calculated per capita (Table 1) or per 
continuously enrolled privately insured non-elderly person (Appendix Figure 4).  For those under 
65, private insurance expenditures per enrollee grew modestly in the middle three income 
quintiles. Medicaid spending per non-elderly recipient declined after 2004 (Appendix Figure 4).  
Per-capita Medicare expenditure growth on behalf of the poor was lower than for other income 
groups during this period, although interpretation of this finding is complex because many poor 
Medicare beneficiaries have supplemental Medicaid coverage. 
 
To explore whether a small number of high-cost patients accounted for the income-based trends 
we observed, we repeated our analyses using quantile regression. Prior to 2004 the faster growth 
of expenditures in the poorest group (and slower growth for the wealthiest) was driven by the 
costliest (and presumably sickest) 10% of patients (Appendix Figure 5a).  After 2004, 
expenditures surged for both low-cost and high-cost affluent patients, but fell for both low-cost 
and high-cost low-income patients (Appendix Figure 5b).

Discussion 
 
The slowdown in health spending growth between 2004 and 2013 was widely reported and much 
celebrated.3,8,20 Our data suggest that slower spending growth was concentrated among poor and 
middle-income Americans, leading to a growing disparity in health expenditures across income 
groups. It is unclear whether the recent acceleration of spending growth will reverse this trend.   
 
The pattern of sharply rising spending for the wealthy, and flat or slow growth for others, mirrors 
the widening gap in the consumption of other goods,12 and may signal a shift towards a more 
“consumer-driven” health care system. 
  
Prior to the implementation of Medicaid and Medicare in 1966, the poor had the lowest health 
expenditures despite their greater medical need, while expenditures for the wealthy were nearly 
twice as high.  Subsequent to these public investments, health spending tracked closer to medical 
need, with the poorest income quintile having the highest expenditures, and the top quintile the 
lowest.  (However, after adjusting for age and health status, the gap between income groups 
never fully reversed.) The pattern of higher (unadjusted) expenditures for poorer persons persists 
for the elderly, virtually all of whom have public coverage through Medicare. Among the non-
elderly, however, the income-related pattern reversed after 2004: wealthy individuals - who are 
the healthiest segment of the population - now have the highest expenditures. 
 
The shift of some lower-income families from private coverage to Medicaid,16 which pays lower 
fees, could explain part of the widening gap in per-visit payments.  However, this would not 
explain the disparate trends in visit rates, the divergence between the wealthy and the middle 
class, or the fall in expenditures among poorer persons with private insurance. 
 
The slowdown in medical spending growth since 2004 is the sum of disparate trends: flat 
spending for the elderly and poor; slow growth for the non-elderly middle class; and rapid 
expenditure growth for the non-elderly wealthy.  Personal healthcare expenditures totaled 
$2.3793 trillion in 2012;20 if all income groups had experienced the same growth as the 
 13 
 
wealthiest quintile between 2004 and 2012, personal health spending would have been 
approximately $2.5370 trillion in 2012, an increase of $157 billion in that year alone.  
 
Research on the health spending slowdown has largely focused on the various structural changes 
in the health care system that may have contributed to slower growth, as well as the extent to 
which the Great Recession deserves most of the credit.2-9 Although cyclical (i.e., recession-
related) factors could result in the observed income-related trends in health spending, the 
divergence in spending appears to pre-date the Great Recession by several years.1 
 
Some structural changes, including greater provider efficiency and fewer expensive 
“blockbuster” pharmaceuticals entering the market, would be expected to affect all income 
groups uniformly.  Other structural changes – particularly increased cost-sharing for the privately 
insured - would be expected to have a greater impact on low- and middle-income people, 
consistent with our findings. Cost sharing and depressed income among the poor and middle 
class may explain why spending by the privately insured dropped after 2008,6 and why regions 
of the U.S. most affected by the Great Recession experienced the slowest growth in health 
spending for the privately insured between 2007 and 2011.2  
 
A mix of cyclical and structural factors - the lingering effects of the Great Recession on non-
wealthy households and increased cost sharing – seems the best explanation for the rising 
income-based spending disparities we observed.  Wages for most workers have been slow to 
rebound from the recession.  Meanwhile, the percentage of privately-insured workers with 
individual-plan deductibles of at least $2,000 has increased six-fold since 2006.21 Such high-
deductible plans cause particularly large drops in healthcare utilization among the highest cost 
(i.e. sickest) enrollees22 and disproportionately impact lower-income workers.  
 
The trend toward higher co-payments and deductibles seems likely to continue under the ACA. 
A typical individual “Silver” plan sold through the insurance exchanges carries a $2,907 
deductible.15 While the ACA's Medicaid expansion will boost expenditures for the eight million 
newly-enrolled, they constitute only 13% of the poorest quintile, and several states are imposing 
cost sharing on Medicaid enrollees,23 which may attenuate utilization increases. 
 14 
 
 
The rising income-based disparities in spending suggest a shift from allocation of health care 
according to need to allocation by willingness (and ability) to pay. Additional research is needed 
to determine whether this shift arises from the underuse of needed care among the poor or 
overuse of unnecessary care by the wealthy, e.g. due to supply-induced demand.24-26
24xx2526 In either 
case, the pattern suggests declining efficiency in resource allocation.  
 
Several caveats apply to our findings. Although the MEPS and its predecessors accurately reflect 
national trends in medical spending (and are widely used for analyses of expenditures for 
population and disease subgroups) they understate total expenditures as tabulated in the National 
Health Expenditure Accounts (NHEA) due to a number of factors, including the exclusion of 
persons in institutions (e.g. nursing homes) and the military; alternative medicine (e.g., 
acupuncture); and “non-patient care revenues”; and the under-representation of high-expenditure 
patients.27,28 Prior studies examining trends in health spending by age and gender adjusted for 
this discrepancy by scaling their estimates to data from the NHEA.29 However, such adjustment 
was not possible in our analysis because income data are not available in the NHEA.  
 
Second, the 1963, 1970, 1977, and 1980 surveys recorded charges rather than actual payments 
for medical services. Because charges often exceed actual payments, the pre-1987 surveys 
probably overestimate spending.  However, this discrepancy would likely be similar across 
income groups and should not greatly distort income-related trends. 
 
Increasing social and economic inequality has drawn considerable attention in recent years.  Our 
findings suggest that disparities in health care spending is also on the rise; expenditures for the 
poorest (and sickest) segment of the population are falling, while those for the wealthy are 
growing rapidly, and now exceed those for other Americans. Additional research is needed to 
determine whether this pattern persists as health spending growth rebounds to pre-2004 levels, 
and whether these emerging spending disparities, which have not been seen since prior to the 
introduction of Medicare and Medicaid, may manifest in widening disparities in health 
outcomes.30,31
