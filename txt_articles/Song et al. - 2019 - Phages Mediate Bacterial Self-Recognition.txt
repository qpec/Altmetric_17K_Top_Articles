In Brief
While bacteria are foraging, it is beneficial
for them to distinguish themselves from
related strains. Here, Song et al. show
that a lytic phage that infects Escherichia
coli may be used to preferentially lyse
cells that are not infected so that the
infected cells outcompete their virus-free
rivals.

SUMMARY
Cells are social, and self-recognition is a conserved
aspect of group behavior where cells assist kin and
antagonize non-kin. However, the role of phage in
self-recognition is unexplored. Here we find that
a demarcation line is formed between different
swimming Escherichia coli strains but not between
identical clones; hence, motile cells discriminate be-
tween self and non-self. The basis for this self-recog-
nition is a 49 kb, T1-type, lytic phage of the family
Siphoviridae (named here SW1) that controls forma-
tion of the demarcation line by utilizing one of the
host’s cryptic prophage proteins, YfdM of CPS-53,
to propagate. Critically, SW1 provides a conditional
benefit to E. coli K-12 compared with the identical
strain that lacks the phage. A demarcation line is
also formed when strains harbor either the lysogenic
phage f80 or lambda and encounter siblings that
lack the lysogen. In summary, bacteria can use
phage to distinguish siblings that lack phage.
INTRODUCTION
Cellular motility impacts bacterial physiology by providing a
means for acquiring nutrients (e.g., chemotaxis) (Armitage,
1992), evading stress (Armitage, 1992), initiating biofilm forma-
tion (Wood et al., 2006), and dispersing biofilms (Petrova and
Sauer, 2016). Two of the best-studied forms of motility are
swarming, which is flagella-based movement on top of a solid
surface, and swimming, which is flagella-based movement
through liquids (Alberti and Harshey, 1990). Motility can also be
social and is a critical part of self-recognition, a behavior that im-
pacts
nourishment,
virulence,
iron
acquisition,
protection,
quorum sensing, biofilm formation, and fruiting bodies (Strass-
mann et al., 2011). In effect, self-recognition allows bacteria to
form social groups (Wall, 2016).
Self-recognition mechanisms studied to date depend on sur-
face receptors and diffusible chemical signals (Troselj et al.,
2018). For example, during the swarming of Proteus mirabilis,
self-recognition takes the form of a demarcation line (Dienes
line; Gibbs et al., 2008); as cells move on the surface, a visible
gap is formed between different strains due to killing as a result
of cell-cell contact through identity proteins (IdsD and IdsE) that
are probably delivered by a type VI secretion system (Cardarelli
et al., 2015) as well as due to killing by bacteriocins (Kusek and
Herman, 1980). Similarly, several self-recognition determinants
have been identified for swarming Bacillus subtilis cells,
including contact-dependent inhibition and secreted antimicro-
bials (Lyons et al., 2016). Additionally, self-recognition during
swarming is mediated through a toxin-antitoxin system requiring
outer membrane exchange in Myxococcus xanthus, in which
non-motile cells can prevent the swarming of cells that lack the
antitoxin (Dey et al., 2016). However, self-recognition during
swimming motility (i.e., motility through liquids) has not been re-
ported previously, and self-recognition during swimming or
swarming has not been linked to phage-mediated cell lysis.
Escherichia coli K-12 contains nine cryptic prophages that
individually are incapable of producing active phage particles
and constitute 3.6% of its genome (Wang et al., 2010). Rather
than genomic junk, we found these cryptic prophages help the
cell cope with stress (Wang et al., 2010). We also found that pro-
phage genes are induced in E. coli during biofilm formation
(Domka et al., 2007) and that cryptic prophage influence biofilm
formation in this strain (Garcı
´a Contreras et al., 2008; Wang et al.,
2010, 2009). Furthermore, active, filamentous phage influence
the biofilm dispersal and phenotypic variation of Pseudomonas
aeruginosa (Webb et al., 2004). Hence, cryptic and active phages
are involved intimately in cell physiology in roles distinct from
phage propagation.
Here, we became intrigued when we encountered a demarca-
tion line between different swimming E. coli cells (Figure 1) and
investigated the underlying mechanism. We screened the swim-
ming behavior of 4,296 single-gene knockouts of the Keio collec-
tion (Baba et al., 2006) and found that the demarcation line
disappears for a mutation related to phage development. By
hypothesizing the gap between swimming cells was related to
phage lysis, we identified a T1-type lytic phage (named SW1)
that allows E. coli K-12 to recognize their own clonemates (this
phage appears to arise from the Keio collection). By utilizing
our strains devoid of each of the nine resident cryptic prophage
in E. coli (Wang et al., 2010), we determined that the demarcation
line is enhanced by putative methylase YfdM of cryptic phage
CPS-53, and the extent of the demarcation line is directly related
to the concentration of phage. Similar results were found with
lysogenic phage lambda and f80. Furthermore, we found
commensal E. coli K-12 distinguishes itself from the pathogen
enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC); this recognition has not
been identified previously as it was reported that E. coli K-12 is
not sensitive to the phage of EHEC (Hernandez-Doria and

 Sperandio, 2018). Hence, cells employ both active (lytic and
temperate) phages and inactive phages (cryptic prophage
CPS-53) to control cell to cell contact of commensal gastrointes-
tinal tract bacteria. Although it is generally understood that
phage lyse related bacteria that lack the corresponding phage,
we argue here that lytic phage SW1 is not a mere contaminant
but instead that the E. coli K-12 strain uses the phage to its
benefit in a social sense; i.e., during nutrient foraging and immu-
nity from other phages.
RESULTS
Phages Cause Bacteria to Form Demarcation Lines
during Swimming Motility
We initially noticed a clear demarcation line between two
different E. coli K-12 strains, MG1655 and BW25113, which is
found later in this work to harbor lytic phage SW1 (henceforth
BW25113 [SW1]) when inoculated on the same motility plate
(Figure 1A); the demarcation line was absent for identical clones:

tween Siblings with Different Phage Content

strains.
To confirm the motility of identical cells

when
their

halos meet, we labeled siblings (e.g.,
MG1655 versus MG1655) with either red
fluorescent protein (RFP) and GFP and
found complete mixing of individual cells
in the demarcation line (Figure 1B). In
contrast, for non-identical strains (i.e.,
MG1655 versus BW25113 [SW1]), we
found
that
when
their

halos
meet, there was no mixing of cells and a clear gap formed
(Figure 1A).
The Demarcation Line between Siblings Depends on
Cryptic Prophage CPS-53
We hypothesized the demarcation line was due to a secreted cell
product; hence, we searched the complete E. coli K-12 library of
single-gene knockouts (Keio collection based on BW25113) as a
pooled library by plating approximately 10 colonies per motility
plate, challenging with MG1655, and looking for the absence
of the demarcation line as an indicator of a missing secreted pro-
tein. To better characterize the intersection of the two competing
motility halos, we developed a demarcation line index (based on
darkness, gap width, and consistency) with a value of 0 indicating
complete merging and 10 indicating a completely formed
demarcation line. This screen identified eight mutants (yahO,
yghG, rpoC, yecA, yfdC, ygeA, mhpA, and rep) that had dimin-
ished demarcation lines (Figure S1). Of these, only the rep
mutation completely eliminated the demarcation line. The rep
738
Cell Reports 27, 737–749, April 16, 2019
 mutation has been linked previously to a swimming and swarm-
ing defect (Girgis et al., 2007), and Rep is required for replication
of some lysogenic bacteriophages, such as P2 (Calendar et al.,
1970) as an ATP-dependent helicase. Therefore, we focused
on phage-related proteins as necessary for the cell to make
the demarcation line.
To efficiently check for relationship between the resident
E. coli cryptic phage and the demarcation line, we tested the
BW25113 (SW1) D9 strain that lacks all nine of the cryptic pro-
phage (Wang et al., 2010) versus MG1655, and we found the
two motility halos merged and the demarcation line was elimi-
nated (Figure 1D); hence, phage-related proteins are responsible
for the demarcation line and self-recognition.
We then tested each of the nine derivatives of BW25113
(SW1) with a single, complete cryptic prophage deletion
(DCP4-6, DDLP12, De14, Drac, DQin, DCP4-44, DCPS-53,
DCPZ-55, and DCP4-57) (Wang et al., 2010) by spotting each
strain by itself on motility plates and checking for a clearance
zone at the colony periphery; therefore, this clearance zone is
distinct from the demarcation line that forms when two motility
halos meet. This colony lysis zone assay allowed us to examine
the impacts of phage on the colony (a type of biofilm), on the
cells just outside of the colony (including the viability of individ-
ual cells), and on the motility halo. We found that strains lacking
cryptic prophages CPS-53 and CP4-57 failed to make a clear-
ance zone beyond their colonies on a motility plate (Figure 2)
and that deleting CPS-53 prevented BW25113 (SW1) from
forming a clearance zone at the boundary of its colony (Fig-
ure 2). In comparison, some clearance at the colony boundary
was seen for the strain that lacked CP4-57 (Figure 2). Hence,
proteins related to cryptic prophage CPS-53 are required for
the colony clearance zone and for the demarcation line. Note
that the strain lacking CPS-53 is still susceptible to killing by
SW1 (Figure S2A).
To test whether the complete CPS-53 phage or one its
proteins is required to make the demarcation line, we tested
13 single gene mutants of CPS-53 and found that strains with
a deletion in CPS-53 prophage genes yfdQ and yfdM elimi-
nated the demarcation line with MG1655 (Figure S1C); yfdQ
encodes an uncharacterized protein, and yfdM encodes a
putative methylase. We then tested these mutants further by
trying to restore the demarcation line in these CPS-53 mutants
via production of each protein via pCA24N plasmids in its
respective BW25113 (SW1) knockout strain and found produc-
tion of YfdM in the yfdM host and YfdQ in the yfdQ host re-es-
tablished the demarcation line with MG1655 (Figures S1D and
S1E). Critically, production of these two CPS-53 proteins

 generated hundreds of plaques with BW25113 (SW1) in the soft
agar (Figure 3A for YfdM). In addition, as negative controls, pro-
duction of either YfdM or YfdQ in the DCPS-53 strain did not
produce plaques, production of YdfM in the absence of CPS-
53 (i.e., DCPS-53/pCA24N-yfdM) did not cause a demarcation
line to form with MG1655 (Figure S3A for YfdM), and production
of YfdM in a CPS-53+ strain that lacks SW1 did not produce
plaques (i.e., BW25113 [no SW1]/pCA24N-yfdM, Figure S3B).
These results show the demarcation line depends on cryptic
prophage CPS-53 and its proteins YfdQ and YfdM. For the
remaining experiments, we focused on YfdM since YfdQ is
uncharacterized, and methylases are important for phage prop-
agation (Roberts et al., 2004).
Lytic Phage SW1 Creates the Demarcation Line
Since we found plaques when YfdM was produced and since
CPS-53 is a cryptic prophage unable to produce phage particles
(Rudd, 1999), we hypothesized that the demarcation line is from
cell lysis caused by a phage carried by the strain. To test for the
presence of the phage, we produced YfdM from pCA24N-yfdM
in BW25113 (SW1), added the supernatant to BW25113 (SW1)
cells, and found a dramatic reduction in the turbidity of the cul-
tures (Figure 3B). We then used scanning electron microscopy
to obtain images of the cells at 0 h and 3 h and found the turbidity
reduction was likely caused by phage particles that are seen
clearly adhered to BW25113 (SW1) cells (Figure 3C). Therefore,
producing YfdM in BW25113 (SW1) causes phage to form and
cells to lyse.
To investigate whether the phage was related to the demarca-
tion line, we made a phage lysis zone by adding (20 mL) of various
concentrations of supernatant of BW25113 (SW1)/pCA24N-
yfdM containing phage to the motility plate. The supernatant
containing phage (108 pfu/mL) formed a thicker barrier between
motile cells in a streak test than supernatants with less phage
(10�1 pfu/mL) (Figure 3D), suggesting that it was phage causing
the demarcation line when swimming cells meet.
To clarify thisresult, we testedwhether the demarcation linebe-
tween
BW25113
(SW1)/pCA24N
versus
BW25113
(SW1)/
pCA24N-yfdM depends on production of YfdM and found larger
demarcation lines with increasing concentrations of isopropyl
b-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) to induce yfdM (Figure S3C).
Critically, the demarcation line only formed on the side of the
motility halo where the halos meet; i.e., SW1 phage is primarily
madeby the infected strainwhenitmeetssiblingsthatlackphage.
Furthermore, to show the demarcation line is produced by cell
lysis from SW1 phage, we took samples from the demarcation
line and motility halo and performed plaque assays. After diluting
the phage 100-fold, we found substantial cell lysis and plaque
formation from the agar sample from the demarcation line, but
no plaques formed from the motility halo sample (Figure S3D).
Together with the preceding section, these results indicate that
cryptic prophage CPS-53 controls the production of active
SW1 phage particles and that lysis by this lytic phage is respon-
sible for producing the demarcation line. This defective-helper
relationship has been seen previously in EHEC temperate
phages (Asadulghani et al., 2009).
Characterizing Phage SW1
To characterize the phage associated with BW25113 (SW1),
we captured transmission electron micrograph images of
the phage made from the supernatants of BW25113 (SW1)/
pCA24N-yfdM (Figure 3E). The phage formed round plaques
5 mm in diameter on a lawn of BW25113 (SW1) cells (Figure 3A);
the phage capsid is approximately 71 nm in diameter, and the
non-contractile tail is approximately 205 nm. Hence, it is a fam-
ily Siphoviridae phage based on its morphology (Figure 3E). We
suggest the name Escherichia phage vB_EcoS-SW1 (SW1
hereafter) based on the naming convention (Adriaenssens and
Brister, 2017).
By sequencing the DNA of the phage particles, we deter-
mined SW1 is a phage (49,096 bp; Table S1; Figure S4;
GenBank: PRJNA498536) that is similar to lytic phage T1
(85% identity, 48,836 bp; GenBank: AY216660) and phage
vB_EcoS_SH2 (99% identity, 49,088 bp; GenBank: Y985004).
PCR of the three SW1 phage genes (exonuclease, tail fiber,
and recombinase) confirmed that SW1 is not present in the
BW25113 (SW1) or MG1655 genome; hence, it is a lytic phage
(so it does not exist in the genome as a lysogen but exists
extracellularly) (Figures S5A and S5B). Corroborating this,
both an integrase and excisionase usually associated with
lysogeny are not present in the SW1 genome (Table S1).
Further evidence that SW1 is similar to T1 was found by select-
ing strains from a pooled Keio collection that could grow in the
presence of SW1 phage particles. After sequencing to identify
the mutations that prevented SW1 lysis, we found that
BW25113 (SW1) cells with a fhuA (14 times) or tonB (1 time)
mutation are less sensitive to SW1. FhuA is the attachment pro-
tein for T1 (Bo
¨ hm et al., 2001; Langenscheid et al., 2004), and
we found the fhuA mutant is nearly completely resistant to SW1
with both a soft agar and a liquid culture assay (Figure S2). In
addition, SW1 could not be detected in the fhuA mutant via
PCR. TonB is necessary for T1 transfer through the membrane
(Bo
¨ hm et al., 2001; Langenscheid et al., 2004), and we found
the tonB mutant is 107 times more resistant than the wild-type
strain but not almost completely resistant like fhuA (Figure S2).
Hence, SW1 is a T1-type, lytic phage.

 Lysogenic Phages Lambda and f80 Create a
Demarcation Line
To ensure the plaques generated by producing YfdM in BW25113
(SW1) were solely related to CPS-53, we tested BW25113 (SW1)
and found it did not contain lambda phage nor did it contain
phage f80 (Figures S5C and S5D). To corroborate the formation
of the demarcation line is by lysis by SW1, we tested a MG1655
strain that harbors phage lambda. When MG1655 lacking lambda
was placed on motility plates with MG1655 containing lambda, a
clear demarcation line was formed (Figure 3F). In addition,
MG1655 with lysogenic lambda phage formed a demarcation
line with MG1655 with both lysogenic f80 and lambda (Fig-
ure 3G). Hence, demarcation lines are formed from cell lysis
due to phage when one of the strains lacks the phage. Further-
more two phages cause a more extensive demarcation line to
form. We also found the lambda-resistant strain BW25113
lamB does not form a demarcation line with BW25113 infected
with lambda (Data S1Aa); hence, there is preferential lysis of the
non-infected strain when a demarcation line forms. These results
indicate that phages are shed by the lysogens, and these phages
are used to kill siblings that are not infected.
To corroborate this result, we tested whether BW25113
lacking SW1 phage (obtained from the Coli Genetic Stock
Center) forms a demarcation line with MG1655 and found
that without SW1, BW25113 does not form a demarcation
line with MG1655 (Figure 3H). As expected, BW25113 forms
a demarcation line with BW25113 infected with the SW1 phage
(Figure 3I). In addition, BW25113 (SW1) forms a demarcation
line with the lambda-resistant strain BW25113 lamB; hence,
the demarcation line caused by phage SW1 is not related to
lambda phage.
Colonies with Phages Form a Colony Lysis Zone on
Motility Plates
Observation of spotted colonies on motility plates provided
additional evidence of the presence of phage and cell lysis.
By examining individual cells in the colony lysis zone, we found
SW1 kills cells that carry it just outside the colony to form pre-
cipitates we termed crystals (Data S1Ab); the diffuse staining
by Syto9 and propidium iodide indicates the presence of extra-
cellular DNA from lysis. In contrast, cells carrying phage SW1 in
the motility halo (in the absence of a demarcation line) are
dense and show no sign of lysis (Data S1Ab). Furthermore,
this single-strain analysis shows that only cells that lack cryptic
prophages CPS-53 and CP4-57 fail to a produce colony lysis
zone with crystals, although the DCP4-57 strain has a gap be-
tween the colony and its motility halo (Figure 2). Note there is
cell death in the DCPS-53 sample (about 50% of the cells are
dead and stain red with propidium iodide); however, this is
not related to SW1 phage since this strain has high motility
and the whole motility halo resembles a colony, which is a
type of dense biofilm, and all of the prophage mutants and
wild-type strain have a significant number of dead cells in their
colonies.
We also found this colony lysis zone phenomenon for MG1655
including phages lambda and f80, whereas the MG1655 lacking
phage does not show this phenotype (Data S1Ba). In addition,
MG1655 infected by SW1 phage also has a colony lysis zone
(Data S1Ba). These results demonstrate that the presence of
active phage can be discerned from the colony lysis zone for
colonies on motility plates and that some of the infected cells
lyse.
Moreover, by using the colony lysis zone approach, we found
that colonies of BW25113 DyfdM and BW25113 DCPS-53 were
not changed by SW1 phage infection (Data S1C). Hence, the
absence of the colony lysis zone shows again the dependence
of SW1 on proteins of cryptic prophage CPS-53, specifically,
the dependence on YfdM.
Cells Lyse in the Demarcation Line Due to Phage
To determine the role of phage in self-recognition, we investi-
gated whether cells lyse in the demarcation line when phage
are produced. We found that although the demarcation line ap-
pears clear on motility plates, there are some cells in this zone,
and their numbers are about 10-fold less than in the periphery
of the swimming halo (Data S1D; Table S1). Critically, we found
that for strains that produce a demarcation line, i.e., for
MG1655 versus BW25113 (SW1) and for BW25113 (SW1)/
pCA24N-yfdM versus BW25113 (SW1)/pCA24N, cells are dead
in the demarcation line (Data S1D; Figure 4), which indicates
phage propagation (i.e., lysis) throughout its swimming halo. In
contrast, for strains not producing a demarcation line; i.e., for
BW25113 (SW1)/pCA24N versus BW25113 (SW1)/pCA24N
(Data S1E), all the cells were healthy and unlysed in the merging
motility halos. Notably, SW1 primarily kills the strain not produc-
ing YfdM as the swimming halos meet (Figure 4) since motile
cells producing YfdM near the demarcation line show little death,
while cells of the other halo near the demarcation line are nearly
all dead. These results demonstrate clearly that the demarcation
line is formed from the lysis of siblings that lack SW1 and that sib-
lings infected with SW1 have some immunity from cell lysis by
phage SW1 when swimming cells meet. Note escape flares are
frequently seen (Figure 4), but since the demarcation line formed
by these flares is strong, these are probably due to differences in
the number of cells that escape killing by phage SW1 in the col-
ony lysis zone and make the motility halo (Figure 2) rather than
the development SW1-resistant fhuA mutants.
YfdM and Phage SW1 Are Used to Distinguish Siblings
On the basis of our results, we reasoned that cells could be made
to no longer recognize siblings if one strain over-produced
phage. Verifying this hypothesis, overproduction of CPS-53
phage protein YfdM in BW25113 leading to overproduction of
phage caused the formation of a very large demarcation line
with BW25113 (SW1)/pCA24N (Figure 5A) in which cells were
clearly killed. In contrast, without YfdM production, the two
BW25113 (SW1) strains merged perfectly (Figure 5B). In
addition, production of YfdM in the absence of CPS-53 in both
strains was unable to produce a demarcation line (Figure 5C).
Additionally, production of YfdM in MG1655 (i.e., MG1655/
pCA24N-yfdM) was unable to produce a demarcation line with
MG1655/pCA24N (Figure 5D), since MG1655 lacks phage
SW1.
As
expected,
two MG1655/pCA24N
strains merge
perfectly (Figure 5E). Therefore, YfdM together with SW1 are
necessary to form the demarcation line in BW25113, and siblings
can be distinguished by the production of phage.

 To confirm that siblings can be distinguished through phage,
we infected MG1655 with SW1 phage and tested whether a
demarcation line could be created with MG1655 that lack phage
SW1. We found MG1655 with phage SW1 forms a large demarca-
tion line with MG1655 that lacks SW1; hence, again, phage can
be used to distinguish siblings (Data S1Bb). Similarly, we infected
the non-laboratory strains E. coli K-12 ATCC 25404 and
ATCC11303 with SW1 and found a demarcation line forms only
in the infected strain versus MG1655 (Data S1F).
SW1 Allows Cells to Recognize EHEC
Additionally, we investigated whether commensal K-12 could
recognize pathogenic bacteria, such as EHEC, through the

use of phage. We found K-12 with SW1
formed a demarcation line with EHEC
(Data S1G); in contrast, the swimming ha-
los of two EHEC colonies merged. These
results confirm siblings can distinguish
clonemates (and not form a demarcation
line) and that lysis occurs when two
different strains meet and have different
phages. In addition, EHEC colonies have
a colony lysis zone (Data S1Gj), and
EHEC swimming cells form a smaller but
discernable
demarcation
line with
the
K-12 strain that lacks SW1 (Data S1Gc
and S1Gd), indicating EHEC also uses
its own active phage particles (Asadul-
ghani et al., 2009) for self-recognition.
Further proof that EHEC phage recog-
nizes E. coli K-12 is that we found that
phage particles isolated from EHEC form
plaques with both BW25113 (SW1) and
BW25113 that lacks SW1 (Data S1Gk
and S1Gl). We identified the EHEC phage
that is active on K-12 as 933W (Data
S1H). To confirm that EHEC competes
with E. coli K-12 and that there is a condi-
tional fitness advantage to being infected with SW1, we tested
the resistance of BW25113 (SW1) versus EHEC with purified
SW1 phage and with EHEC phage. Phage was added to flasks
containing both strains, and the surviving cells were counted
based
on
their
color
difference.
The
results
show
that
BW25113 (SW1) is only slightly more resistant to both SW1
and EHEC phage compared with EHEC (Figure 6A); this result
is expected since both bacteria already have phage and there-
fore some immunity when challenged with different phages.
Overall, EHEC competes with E. coli K-12 and forms a demar-
cation line, but the presence of phage SW1 in K-12 and
numerous phages in EHEC provide some immunity to each
strain.

 SW1 Increases Cell Fitness with Siblings Conditionally
To determine whether SW1 increases cell fitness for siblings that
that contain SW1, we labeled cells to distinguish their motility
halos and monitored swimming motility for BW25113 (SW1)
versus BW25113. In six out of seven trials, cells infected with
SW1 engulfed those that lack SW1 showing the lytic phage
SW1 provides a demonstrable benefit during nutrient foraging
(Figure 6B; Data S1Ia). Independently, the motility of the two
strains was not significantly different (Data S1Ib and S1Ic). To
confirm the increase in fitness with SW1, we tested the growth
of BW25113 (SW1) relative to BW25113 when challenged with
purified SW1 phage or when challenged with purified EHEC
phage. Phage were added to flasks containing both strains,
and surviving cells were counted based on the colony color cells.
Critically, the results show that BW25113 (SW1) is far more resis-
tant to both SW1 phage and EHEC phage compared with
BW25113 (Figure 6C). Hence, the presence of lytic phage SW1
confers a competitive advantage when challenged with SW1
and phage from other strains.
Origin of Phage SW1
To determine the source of the SW1 phage, we used the colony
lysis zone assay for nine random Keio mutants since we originally
found the colony lysis zone in our BW25113 wild-type stock from
the Keio collection (Baba et al., 2006). We found the colony
lysis zone in five Keio mutants from the original source plates

(Data S1Ja), and three of these strains,
15-G9, 15-E6, and 63-D7, had phage when
YfdM was produced (1 to 6 pfu/100 mL). In
contrast, the Keio strains that do not have
a colony lysis zone, such as 55-3D, did
not
have
phage
with

production
(Data S1Jb). Also, we checked hundreds of Keio mutants for the
Dienes line assay with MG1655, and most of the mutants formed
a demarcation line indicating the presence of SW1 (Figure S1).
Hence, phage SW1 may be pervasive through dissemination of
theKeiocollection(andvisibleinspecificclonesviathecolonylysis
zone assay). Since SW1 is a T1-type phage, and T1 is notoriously
difficult to remove, we feel SW1 is also robust like T1 and readily
propagates when cells contain cryptic prophage CPS-53.
Full activation of SW1 (i.e., plaques formed) requires produc-
tion of YfdQ or putative Dam methylase YfdM of cryptic prophage
CPS-53 (e.g., pCA24N-yfdM). Since neither protein has been
characterized and it is unlikely others would have cause to check
for plaque formation with these specific supernatants, SW1 was
not detected previously. Formation of the demarcation line to
detect SW1 would require studying motility with two different
Keio clones for the case where only one of them was infected
with SW1, since if both clones were infected or if neither clone
were infected, their halos would merge. Of course, a demarcation
line would be seen if an infected Keio clone (or wild-type) were
studied in a motility experiment with an uninfected but suscepti-
ble strain (e.g., MG1655), as we fortuitously did in this work.
DISCUSSION
We demonstrate here that cells use phage for self-recognition.
Hence, during motility, when two strains meet and one strain

 lacks a phage to which it is sensitive, a clearance zone forms in
which the cells that lack the phage are lysed (Figure 4; Data S1D).
Although we did not investigate the role of phage in biofilms (we
focused on swimming motility, a planktonic phenotype), we
anticipate that similar principles apply and that phage-containing
cells have a conditional fitness advantage over non-phage-con-
taining cells.
We also demonstrate here that commensal E. coli uses cell
killing based on proteins from cryptic prophage CPS-53 (e.g.,
YfdM, YfdQ) to activate lytic phage SW1 to differentiate itself
from siblings that lack phage. Hence, our results show a surpris-
ing dependence of lytic phage SW1 on cryptic prophage pro-
teins; this result provides insight into the conditional benefit of
cells harboring cryptic prophage. Of course, dependence on
chromosomal proteins (i.e., non-cryptic prophage proteins) has
been demonstrated previously with T1-type phage; for example,
as we found here, FhuA is required for attachment, and TonB is
required for transfer phage through the cell membrane (Bo
¨ hm
et al., 2001; Langenscheid et al., 2004). Critically, YfdM of
CPS-53 has 91 aa in common with the Dam methylase of
EHEC Stx2 phage (Ogura et al., 2015), and T1 requires Dam.
Moreover, putative methylase YfdM is not related to the Dam
methylase of SW1 or BW25113, so it should provide a novel
methylase function. Hence, SW1 appears to use the putative
Dam methylase of CPS-53 (i.e., YfdM) to make active phage.
Supporting this hypothesis, bacteriophage P1 cleaves its DNA
at a packing site (pac) once it is methylated by adenine meth-
ylase (Fujisawa and Morita, 1997; Sternberg and Coulby,
1990), and T1 also has a pac site (Roberts et al., 2004). Hence,
YfdM of CPS-53 might methylate a pac-like site of SW1 to signal
DNA cleavage for filling the prohead with DNA during phage
packaging, and this methylase activity may limit DNA packaging
(Roberts et al., 2004). Evidence of this is that we only see large
numbers of plaques in the presence of overproduced YfdM (Fig-
ure 3A). However, SW1 propagates whenever there is a wild-
type copy of yfdM+ in the chromosome (but not to the extent
that plaques are readily formed). Alternatively, putative meth-
ylase YfdM may facilitate SW1 proliferation by protecting it
from restriction enzyme attack.
Since some cell death occurs in the absence of neighboring
cells (see the colony lysis zones around colonies on motility
plates [Figure 2; Data S1Ab]), the use of lytic phage imposes
some cost. Overall, the use of lytic phage particles should in-
crease the conditional fitness of commensal E. coli as long as
there is more lysis of the competing cells. Critically, SW1 be-
comes active primarily where the motility halos of siblings in-
fected with phage and siblings lacking phage meet (and not
in other parts of the halo of the SW1-infected cells) since a
large, one-sided demarcation line (‘‘crescent moon’’ shape) is
clearly visible when SW1 concentrations are large (due to pro-
duction of YfdM) (Figure 5A; Data S1Bb). What remains to be
determined is how siblings are protected from phage SW1
since clearly two siblings infected with phage have no demar-
cation line (Figure 1C) and no lysis when their halos meet
(Data S1E). Perhaps, lysis from SW1 is growth-phase depen-
dent (giving rise to the colony lysis zones of Figure 2 and
Data S1Ab) or there is a SW1 protein that delays lysis and gives
immunity as SW1 exists as a pseudolysogen (phage carrier cell)
(Cenens et al., 2013) in which SW1 is replicating autonomously
and at a low frequency releases phage. When a swimming halo
is met of siblings that are not infected, perhaps a signal causes
more phage to be released, resulting in lysis primarily of the
noninfected strain. Since for lysogenic phage, such as lambda
and f80, there should be phage immunity for the phage-
bearing strain (Ptashne et al., 1976; Thieffry and Thomas,
1995), it could be argued that the phage-containing strain
should have an even greater fitness advantage over the
phage-minus strain; however, we found evidence of lysis in
the absence of competing strains for lysogens as well (Data
S1Ba).
The primary benefit for cells infected with SW1 is the fitness
advantage relative to cells that lack SW1 when the cells forage
for food or when challenged by other phage, like that of EHEC,
since we show cells infected with SW1 are more competitive un-
der these two conditions (Figure 6B-6C). Furthermore, the
benefit of retaining cryptic prophage is that without CPS-53,
the cells are still susceptible to SW1 infection (Figure S2), and
the cells do not have any of the benefits since they cannot pro-
duce enough SW1 to lyse significant numbers of siblings that
lack SW1 (Figure 5C). Hence, there is an advantage to being in-
fected with SW1 (a lytic phage) and an advantage to making
more phage progeny by having CPS-53 (Figure 7).
In the gastrointestinal tract, commensal E. coli cells must
compete with around 1,000 other bacterial species, whose com-
bined density reaches 1012 organisms per gram (Wall, 2016). In
addition, about five different E. coli strains usually colonize
each human gastrointestinal tract (Conway and Cohen, 2015),
and the chief competitor of pathogenic E. coli (Huynh et al.) in
the gastrointestinal tract is E. coli K-12 (Ba
¨ umler and Sperandio,
2016). We demonstrated that a demarcation line is formed be-
tween these two strains that requires the phages of both EHEC
and BW25113 (SW1), since EHEC forms a demarcation line
with BW25113 that lacks phage, but the demarcation line is
less strong when there is only phage from EHEC (Data S1Gc
and S1Gd). We also found phages from EHEC form plaques on
BW25113 (Data S1Gk and S1Gl) by utilizing the 933W phage.
Furthermore, we found that the presence of SW1 makes
BW25113 more competitive during nutrient foraging (Figure 6B).
Hence, self-recognition may be important for the success of this
commensal bacterium in increasing its fitness in colonizing
humans, since it is a non-dominant strain (Gorbach, 1996), and
it must compete with similar E. coli strains. Determining the
role of this phage-mediated self-recognition in vivo should be
explored.
Note that there are many phages in the gastrointestinal tract
(Breitbart et al., 2003), and the slow growth of E. coli in this envi-
ronment has led to pseudolysogeny of the virulent phage T4 (Los
et al., 2003); hence, the use of phage for self-recognition is
reasonable. This approach for self-recognition is also general,
based on our results with three phages including both lytic
(e.g., SW1) and lysogenic phage (e.g., lambda, f80), and based
on our results with three commensal E. coli (BW25113,
ATCC25404, and ATCC11303) and pathogenic E. coli (Huynh
et al., 2012). For these results, no overproduction of proteins
like putative methylase YfdM is required to see a clear demarca-
tion line when motility halos meet.

 Overall, our results suggest a bacterial cell infected by a lytic
phage may have conditional benefits over siblings that lack the
phage; for example, while obtaining scarce resources or when
encountering other phages. In addition, these benefits rely on
the infected strain utilizing the tools it obtained from an old en-
emy, a cryptic prophage (Figure 7).

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
The species and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table S1. For deleting and overexpressing genes, we used the Keio collec-
tion and the ASKA library. All experiments were conducted at 37�C, and cells were routinely cultured in lysogeny broth (LB) (Sam-
brook et al., 1989). Kanamycin (50 mg/mL) was used for pre-culturing the isogenic knockout mutants, chloramphenicol (30 mg/mL)
was used for maintaining the pCA24N-based plasmids, and erythromycin (300 mg/mL) was used for maintaining the pCM18-based
plasmids.
METHOD DETAILS
Motility halo assay
Swimming motility was examined using 0.3% agar plates with 1% tryptone and 0.5% NaCl. Motility and demarcation lines were
analyzed after 24 h. Three plates were tested for each culture, and two independent cultures were used. Cultures (5 mL) were dropped
on motility agar plates and each plate contains two strains for observing demarcation line formation and one strain for observing
colony lysis zone formation; plates were incubated 16 h to form motility halos. YfdM was produced via pCA24N-yfdM via its leaky
promoter or via 0.5 mM isopropyl b-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) as indicated. The motility agar plates were dried for 2 h to
achieve consistent results.
Screening via the pooled Keio collection
To identify which E. coli BW25113 proteins are related to the demarcation line with MG1655, we inoculated the pooled Keio collection
onto LB agar plates with kanamycin (50 mg/mL). After incubating at 37�C for 16 h, one colony from the Keio collection was inoculated
with MG1655 on the same motility plate; colonies that merged with the MG1655 halo were selected, and the candidates were
sequenced with primer KFp1 (Table S1). The first PCR was performed with primer Arb1 and Inv-2 with 94�C for 5 min, (94�C for
30 s, 30�C for 30 s, 72�C for 1 min)*5 cycles, (94�C for 30 s, 52�C for 30 s, 72�C for 1 min)*30 cycles, and 72�C for 5 min. The second

 PCR reaction was performed with the PCR product from the first PCR reaction with primers (Arb2 and Kfp-1) using the conditions:
(94�C for 30 s, 50�C for 30 s, 72�C for 1 min) *30 cycles.
To identify which proteins are required for SW1 phage infection in BW25113, SW1 phage stock (1011 pfu/mL) was added (10%) to
the pooled Keio culture with a turbidity of 1.0 at 600 nm. The culture was spread on LB agar plates with kanamycin when the culture
reached a turbidity of 0.1 at OD 600, and the DNA from the colonies was sequenced.
Gel pad microscopy with GFP/RFP-labeled strains
The GFP/RFP labeled strains were inoculated on motility agar on glass slides and incubated overnight. The motility agar was covered
with a cover glass, and the fluorescence signal was analyzed by microscopy (Zeiss Axioscope.A1) using excitation at 488 nm and
emission at 500 nm for GFP fluorescence and using excitation at 561 nm and emission at 575 nm for RFP fluorescence.
Plaque assay
Supernatants from the strains were harvested by centrifugation (8000 g for 10 min) and filtered (0.2 mm), then phage was quantified by
counting plaques using a modified top-layer agar method (Eisenstark, 1967). The plaque assay was performed with three indepen-
dent cultures for each strain with three replicates for each culture. EHEC phage were induced by mitomycin C (10 mg/mL) for obtaining
EHEC phage.
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect phages
To detect lambda phage and f80, PCR was performed with a colony that was mixed with 20 mL of water and boiled for 10 min; 2 mL of
the crude cell extract was used with primers shown in Table S1. To detect phage genes in SW1, phage DNA was used as the DNA
template with primers shown in Table S1 after isolating the phage DNA by the Phage DNA isolation kit 46800 (Norgen Biotetek Corp).
To detect SW1 phage genes associated with BW25113 (SW1) and BW25113 (SW1)/pCA24N-yfdM, genomic DNA was used for
BW25113 (SW1) and a culture (i.e., cells + supernatant) of BW25113 (SW1)/pCA24N-yfdM was used as the DNA template with
primers shown in Table S1.
Electron microscopy
For transmission electron microscopy (TEM), the BW25113/pCA24N-YfdM culture was cultured for 48 h to lyse cells, centrifuged at
8000 g, and the supernatant was filter-sterilized (0.2 mm). The samples were fixed with buffer (2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1M cacody-
late buffer, pH 7.4) and negative stained with 2% uranyl acetate in the dark for 1 h, then dehydrated. The sectioned specimens were
stained again with uranyl acetate and lead citrate after dehydration, resin embedding, and the sectioning process. TEM images were
obtained using a JEOL JEM 1200 EXII instrument. For scanning electron microscopy (SEM), the samples were collected at 0 h, 3 h,
and 6 h after adding the phage stocks to BW25113 cells. The sample was fixed with buffer (2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1M cacodylate
buffer, pH 7.4). SEM images were obtained using a Zeiss SIGMA VP-FESEM instrument.
Viability assay
Once the demarcation line between the strains was formed, it was removed from the motility agar and stained for 1 h at room tem-
perature in the dark using the using the LIVE/DEAD BacLight Bacterial Viability Kit L7012 (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). The
fluorescence signal was analyzed via microscopy using excitation at 485 nm and emission at 530 nm for green fluorescence and us-
ing excitation at 485 nm and emission at 630 nm for red fluorescence (Zeiss Axioscope.A1).
Infection with SW1 phage
To infect bacteria with SW1 phage, phage stock (2% by vol) was added to a culture when the strain reached a turbidity of 1.0 at
600 nm and it was incubated for 24 h.
Infection with lambda phage
To infect bacteria with lambda phage, phage stock (2% by vol) was added to a culture when the strain reached a turbidity of 0.8 at
600 nm, and it was incubated for 6 h. The lambda phage stock was made by inducing MG1655 (l) with mitomycin C (1 mg/mL) and
filtering (0.2 mm).
Phage DNA genome sequencing
Phage DNA was isolated from BW25113/pCA24N-YfdM after growth in LB for 36 h by the Phage DNA isolation kit (Harrison et al.,
2009; 46800, Norgen Biotetek Corp). The DNA library was prepared using a Ligation Sequencing Kit (SQK-LSK108, ONT). Briefly,
1.5 mg of phage genomic DNA in 50 mL distilled water were fragmented by g-TUBE (Harrison et al., 520079, Covaris), and the
DNA fragments were end-repaired and ligated to sequencing adapters. The sequencing was performed with a MiniON flowcell
(MIN-106) (achieves 97% accuracy with 40X coverage) (Tyler et al., 2018) and MinKNOW 2.1 software (v18.05.5, ONT) for 24 hours
and generated about 1,416,720 reads (fast5 files). Albarcore (v2.3.1, ONT) was used for base calling, and about 10.03 Gb were ob-
tained. Since the genome size of SW1 is approximate 50 kb, only 4 fastq files containing 16,000 reads (98,124,380 bp) were used for
de novo assembly via Canu (v1.6) for 2,000X coverage. For polishing and higher accuracy, contigs were subsequently processed with
e3

 Racon (v1.3.1) and Miniasm-0.3 (r179). Using Circlator (v1.5.1), a single circular phage genome was generated (49,245 bp). Genome
annotation was performed by Phast server (http://phast.wishartlab.com).
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Scoring via the demarcation line index (DLI)
The DLI is the combined scores for demarcation line darkness (color), gap width, and consistency (extent over the intersection)
between two competing halos inspired by the scoring method for disease activity which characterizes the clinical and histopathology
features of the dextran sulfate sodium mouse model (Cooper et al., 1993). The maximum DLI score is 10 and scores R 4 indicate the
presence of a clear demarcation line (indicated by a red arrow), and DLI scores % 3 indicate motility halo merging (indicated by a
green arrow). The specific metrics used are shown in the following table:
A score of 4 was chosen as the cutoff since samples that had this score had the basic attributes of a clearance zone between the
two motility halos. Each condition was evaluated for a DLI with at least two independent cultures and two replicates for each inde-
pendent culture so a minimum of 4 motility plates were used (many samples had more plates than this).
Statistical analysis
All results are presented as the mean ± SEM. Microsoft Excel and Sigma Plot Statistics were used for statistical analysis. Data were
analyzed using one-way ANOVA as specified in the Figure legends. ** (p < 0.01) indicates significant differences between BW25113
and BW25113 (SW1).
