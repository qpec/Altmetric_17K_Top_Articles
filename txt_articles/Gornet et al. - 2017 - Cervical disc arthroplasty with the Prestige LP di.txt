OBJECTIVE The authors compared the efficacy and safety of arthroplasty using the Prestige LP cervical disc with 
those of anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) for the treatment of degenerative disc disease (DDD) at 2 adja-
cent levels.
METHODS Patients from 30 investigational sites were randomized to 1 of 2 groups: investigational patients (209) un-
derwent arthroplasty using a Prestige LP artificial disc, and control patients (188) underwent ACDF with a cortical ring 
allograft and anterior cervical plate. Patients were evaluated preoperatively, intraoperatively, and at 1.5, 3, 6, 12, and 
24 months postoperatively. Efficacy and safety outcomes were measured according to the Neck Disability Index (NDI), 
Numeric Rating Scales for neck and arm pain, 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36), gait abnormality, disc height, 
range of motion (investigational) or fusion (control), adverse events (AEs), additional surgeries, and neurological status. 
Treatment was considered an overall success when all 4 of the following criteria were met: 1) NDI score improvement 
of ≥ 15 points over the preoperative score, 2) maintenance or improvement in neurological status compared with preop-
eratively, 3) no serious AE caused by the implant or by the implant and surgical procedure, and 4) no additional surgery 
(supplemental fixation, revision, or nonelective implant removal). Independent statisticians performed Bayesian statistical 
analyses.
RESULTS The 24-month rates of overall success were 81.4% for the investigational group and 69.4% for the control 
group. The posterior mean for overall success in the investigational group exceeded that in the control group by 0.112 
(95% highest posterior density interval = 0.023 to 0.201) with a posterior probability of 1 for noninferiority and 0.993 for 
superiority, demonstrating the superiority of the investigational group for overall success. Noninferiority of the inves-
tigational group was demonstrated for all individual components of overall success and individual effectiveness end 
points, except for the SF-36 Mental Component Summary. The investigational group was superior to the control group 
for NDI success. The proportion of patients experiencing any AE was 93.3% (195/209) in the investigational group and 
92.0% (173/188) in the control group, which were not statistically different. The rate of patients who reported any seri-
ous AE (Grade 3 or 4) was significantly higher in the control group (90 [47.9%] of 188) than in the investigational group 
(72 [34.4%] of 209) with a posterior probability of superiority of 0.996. Radiographic success was achieved in 51.0% 
(100/196) of the investigational patients (maintenance of motion without evidence of bridging bone) and 82.1% (119/145) 
of the control patients (fusion). At 24 months, heterotopic ossification was identified in 27.8% (55/198) of the superior 
levels and 36.4% (72/198) of the inferior levels of investigational patients.

A
nterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) 
has been the standard surgical procedure for cer-
vical degenerative disc disease (DDD) associated 
with intractable radiculopathy or myelopathy since its in-
ception in the 1950s.1,3,4,17,46 However, ACDF, which aims 
to eliminate segmental motion between the fused verte-
brae, creates abnormal loads, increasing stress and in-
tradiscal pressures on segments adjacent to the fusion.7,53 
This altered biomechanics of the spine has been reported 
to increase the incidence of adjacent segment degeneration 
(ASD) and to cause recurrent radiculopathy in as many as 
25% of patients.16,21,25,45
Cervical disc arthroplasty (CDA) has become a more 
commonly used surgical procedure in the treatment of 
cervical DDD. Several large Food and Drug Administra-
tion (FDA) investigational device exemption (IDE) clini-
cal trials have established that CDA and ACDF are at least 
equally safe and effective in treating symptoms associated 
with single-level cervical DDD.13,18,20,22,36,37 However, many 
patients have multilevel disease, and multilevel CDA may 
be a desirable alternative to fusion because multilevel 
ACDF can cause even greater stresses to adjacent discs,30 
thereby potentially hastening ASD. Furthermore, com-
pared with single-level ACDF, multilevel ACDF yields 
higher rates of pseudarthrosis,48 complications, revisions, 
and reoperations.51 In contrast, CDA at 2 adjacent cervical 
levels has been found to provide near normal mobility at 
the 2 implanted levels without affecting the adjacent lev-
els,19 so that each implanted segment in a multilevel CDA 
is considered biomechanically independent of the adjacent 
segments.42 An IDE study demonstrated that patient out-
comes were superior and complications fewer with 2-level 
CDA than with 2-level ACDF.14 A recent meta-analysis re-
ported that multilevel CDA is as safe and effective as sin-
gle-level CDA for the treatment of cervical disc diseases.56
The purpose of this study, which is registered with the 
ClinicalTrials.gov database (http://clinicaltrials.gov; regis-
tration no. NCT00637156), is to report the 24-month re-
sults of an FDA-regulated IDE clinical trial that compared 
the safety and effectiveness of 2-level CDA using Prestige 
LP (Medtronic Inc.) with those of 2-level ACDF to treat 
cervical DDD at 2 contiguous levels.
Methods
Study Design
Patient enrollment required a diagnosis of DDD at 2 
adjacent levels (from C-3 to C-7) involving intractable ra-
diculopathy and/or myelopathy unresponsive to at least 6 
weeks of nonoperative treatment. Inclusion and exclusion 
criteria are listed in Table 1. Patients were evaluated pre-
operatively, intraoperatively, and postoperatively at 1.5, 3, 
6, 12, and 24 months. Data in this paper represent all avail-
able 24-month safety and effectiveness data as of April 
15, 2015.
Sample Size
Determination was based on the hypothesis of nonin-
feriority in overall success of the investigational device 
compared with the control treatment. Expected success 
rates were assumed to be 72% and 70% in the investiga-
tional and control groups, respectively. With a noninferi-
ority margin of 10%, an alpha level of 0.05, and a power 
of 80%, the required sample size was 177 patients for each 
group. With an adjustment of 15% for potential loss to 
follow-up, 210 ± 5 patients were needed per group. Given 
the 1:1 randomization, the enrollment goal for this trial 
was 420 ± 10 patients. Two hundred nine patients received 
the investigational device, and 188 patients received the 
control treatment. 
The study was approved by independent institution-
al review boards at each investigational site. All patients 
who met inclusion requirements and agreed to participate 
signed an informed consent form. Patients at 30 partici-
pating sites were randomized into treatment groups at a 
1:1 ratio stratified by site and by varying block sizes (2, 
4, and 6). The randomization schedule was centrally gen-
erated by the sponsor’s statistician using statistical soft-
ware (SAS, SAS Institute Inc.). Patients and surgeons were 
blinded only through the screening and informed consent 
process.
Investigational Device
The Prestige LP is an unconstrained metal-on-metal de-
vice comprising 2 low-profile plates that interface through 
a ball-and-trough mechanism that allows for 4 indepen-
dent degrees of freedom. The plates attach to the vertebral 
bodies through impaction of the dual serrated keels. The 
device comes in a variety of heights and depths to accom-
modate individual patient anatomy. The low-profile design 
of the Prestige LP, which avoids obstruction of adjacent 
levels, makes it well suited for multilevel implantation. 
Following an IDE clinical trial (NCT00667459), the Pres-
tige LP artificial disc was approved by the FDA in 2014 to 
treat intractable radiculopathy or myelopathy at a single 
level of the cervical spine.
Control Device
The control group received a cortical ring allograft for 
each of the 2 levels and an Atlantis anterior cervical plate 
(Medtronic Inc.) as part of ACDF.
CONCLUSIONS Arthroplasty with the Prestige LP cervical disc is as effective and safe as ACDF for the treatment of 
cervical DDD at 2 contiguous levels and is an alternative treatment for intractable radiculopathy or myelopathy at 2 adja-
cent levels.

Surgical Procedure and Postoperative Care
The surgical procedures in both investigational and 
control groups were performed via a standard anterior 
approach. A thorough dissection was performed at both 
index levels. The anterior annulus, disc, and cartilagi-
nous endplates were removed. Gentle distraction was per-
formed, reestablishing the anatomical disc space height, 
using either intradiscal distraction or Caspar vertebral 
body distraction pins. The lateral margins of the disc 
space were exposed, extending superiorly off of the lateral 
margins of the inferior vertebral body. The posterior an-
nulus and posterior longitudinal ligament were partially or 
totally removed based on pathology, and the central spinal 
canal was exposed and decompressed. The depth of the 
vertebral body was precisely measured with a caliper. In 
the investigational group, the endplates were preserved 
and prepared utilizing a dual keel-cutting device. The size 
of the Prestige LP implant was selected to approximate the 
depth and height of the interspace. Care was taken not to 
overdistract the interspace, and the implant was impacted 
into the disc space. In the control fusion group, the ver-
tebral endplates were decorticated. An anterior plate was 
placed over the cortical ring allograft and secured to the 
adjacent vertebral bodies.
The postoperative care regimen could be modified at 
the treating physician’s discretion to accommodate each 
patient’s needs. The use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory 
drugs was recommended to the investigational group for 
the first 2 postoperative weeks but not thereafter. Postop-
erative bracing was left to the discretion of the physician, 
but only a soft collar was recommended for the investiga-
tional group. 
Clinical Outcome Assessments
Patients completed the following validated question-
naires: the Neck Disability Index (NDI),52 the Medical 
Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-
36),54 and the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS; from 0 to 20 
representing intensity and frequency of pain) for neck and 
arm pain.32 Gait abnormality was also assessed and graded 
on a scale of 0–5 using Nurick’s classification.38 Patients 
were evaluated preoperatively and postoperatively at 1.5, 
3, 6, 12, 24 months.
Radiographic Assessment
Two independent radiologists from a core laboratory 
(Biomedical Systems) performed software-based mea-
surements of digital radiographs. A third independent 
radiologist adjudicated divergent findings. For the inves-
tigational group, radiographic success was determined by 
the maintenance of motion at both treated levels, defined 
as 1) angulation > 4° but ≤ 20° of angular motion, and 
2) no bridging bone forming a continuous bony connec-
tion with adjacent vertebral bodies. For the control group, 
radiographic success was determined by fusion at both 
treated levels, defined as 1) angulation ≤ 4°, 2) bridging 
bone as a continuous bony connection with the vertebral 
bodies above and below, and 3) no radiolucency covering 
more than 50% of either the superior or inferior surface 
of the graft.
Functional Spinal Unit Height Measurement
Functional spinal unit (FSU) height was used as a sur-
rogate measure of subsidence given that disc height is dif-
ficult to measure after implantation of the study device. 
Postoperative anterior and posterior FSU height at both 
treated levels was compared with the same measurement 
obtained 6 weeks preoperatively. Subsidence was inferred 
if the FSU height, anterior or posterior, had decreased by 
at least 2 mm.
Heterotopic Ossification
In the investigational group, heterotopic ossification 
(HO) was assessed on radiographs and graded according 
to the classification by Mehren et al.:33 0 = no HO pres-

movement of the prosthesis, or IV = complete fusion of 
treated segment without movement in flexion or extension.
Safety Assessment
Neurological function was assessed by physician-con-
ducted tests of motor, sensory, and reflex functions. Neu-
rological success was achieved if the preoperative status 
was maintained or improved. An adverse event (AE) was 
defined as any adverse clinical sign, symptom, syndrome, 
or illness that occurred or worsened during the operative 
and postoperative periods but did not necessarily include 
the predictable postoperative reactions, such as chills or 
vomiting. Adverse event categorization followed the FDA 
suggestion for the single-level Prestige LP IDE trial,18 
which was based, in part, on the study sponsor’s inter-
nal AE process and in part on the Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) coding system. This hy-
brid system places each of 20 classifications of AEs under 
a broad body system (for example, neurological, cardiac 
disorders), incident (for example, trauma, infection), or 
other (associated conditions or systems with small nu-
merical incidence). The severity of each AE (Grades 1–4: 
mild, moderate, severe, or life threatening, respectively, 
according to WHO criteria) and the association with the 
implant or surgical procedure were assessed by 2 mem-
bers of an independent Clinical Adjudication Commit-
tee (CAC). A third CAC member adjudicated in cases 
of disagreement. Secondary surgical interventions were 
classified as revision, removal, supplemental fixation, or 
reoperation.
Primary Trial End Point
The primary end point, as required by the FDA, was 
a composite measure of overall success. Overall success 
was achieved when all 4 of the following criteria were 
met: 1) NDI score improvement of ≥ 15 points over the 
preoperative score, 2) maintenance or improvement in 
neurological status compared with preoperatively, 3) no 
serious AE caused by the implant or by both the implant 
and surgical procedure, and 4) no additional surgery clas-
sified as supplemental fixation, revision, or nonelective 
implant removal.
Other Effectiveness Measurements
Foraminal encroachment was assessed using the fo-
raminal compression test. Foraminal encroachment was 
deemed present when pain was provoked by applying 
downward pressure on a patient’s head in the neutral po-
sition and rotating the head left and right. Patients were 
asked postoperatively to respond to 3 statements regard-
ing satisfaction with their surgery: 1) I am satisfied with 
the results of my surgery; 2) I was helped as much as I 
thought I would be with my surgery; and 3) All things 
considered, I would have the surgery again for the same 
condition. The possible answers ranged from “definitely 
true” to “definitely false.” Patients were asked about the 
perceived effect of treatment. The 7 possible answers 
ranged from “completely recovered” to “vastly worsened.” 
Patient work status was recorded preoperatively and at all 
postoperative evaluations. Work status and time to return 
to work were compared between treatment groups.
Independent Data Review
As was done in the analysis of the 1-level Prestige LP 
IDE trial,18 the study sponsor delivered the entire database 
of raw data to independent biostatisticians at Vanderbilt 
University for analysis. This study reports the analyses 
and results of the independent team, which followed the 
FDA-approved methods from the original statistical plan 
and reached the same statistical conclusions as those in 
the study sponsor analysis. Statisticians for the sponsor 
used the SAS statistical software (SAS Institute Inc.) to 
generate the summary tables and WinBUGS (Cambridge 
Institute of Public Health) to conduct the Bayesian anal-
ysis. The independent statisticians at Vanderbilt used R 
software (R Foundation for Statistical Computing) for the 
summary tables and JAGS (Cambridge Institute of Public 
Health) to conduct the Bayesian analysis.
Statistical Analyses
The hypothesis in this trial was that the 24-month over-
all success rate of the investigational group would be sta-
tistically noninferior to that of the control group (with a 
noninferiority margin of 0.1). If noninferiority were estab-
lished, we predetermined that superiority would be exam-
ined. Bayesian methods were used to compare outcomes 
between the treatment groups. In addition to the 24-month 
outcomes, 12-month outcomes were also incorporated 
into the Bayesian likelihood model, although the focus of 
the comparison was the 24-month outcomes. Noninfor-
mative priors were used.29 Noninferiority and superiority 
were established if the posterior probability was at least 
95%. Analyses similar to those for the overall success 
rate were conducted for success in individual effective-
ness end points: NDI, FSU height, NRS neck pain, NRS 
arm pain, Physical Component Summary (PCS), Mental 
Component Summary (MCS), neurological measure, and 
gait measure. Success for these individual end points was 
defined as follows: NDI improvement of at least 15 points; 
FSU height maintenance within 2 mm; and maintenance 
or improvement in neck pain, arm pain, SF-36 PCS, SF-36 
MCS, neurological status, and gait status, respectively.
Secondary end points included safety measures (AEs 
and additional surgical procedures or interventions) and 
surgical and hospitalization information (operative time, 
blood loss, and number of hospital days). Bayesian meth-
ods were also used to examine the difference between the 
treatment groups for these end points. The null hypoth-
esis (that there was no difference) was rejected if the 95% 
highest posterior density (HPD) included 0. Superiority 
was established if the posterior probability of a lower rate 
or mean in the investigational group than in the control 
group was at least 97.5%. 
Descriptive statistics of demographics, baseline char-
acteristics, and some postoperative measurements were 
presented using mean and standard deviation for continu-

ous variables and frequencies for categorical variables. 
Statistical comparisons between groups were made using 
Fisher’s t-test for continuous variables and Fisher’s exact 
test for categorical variables. Preoperative to postopera-
tive changes in NDI, NRS neck pain, NRS arm pain, and 
SF-36 PCS and MCS scores, as well as radiographic mea-
surements of motion, were assessed using paired t-tests, 
and gait status and foraminal compression tests were as-
sessed using exact McNemar’s test. A p value < 0.05 was 
considered statistically significant.
To compare return-to-work status between the 2 treat-
ment groups, a Cox proportional-hazards model was fitted 
with preoperative working status included as covariate.
The primary analysis data set consisted of all patients 
who received the study treatments. The outcomes of a 
small number of patients who required an additional pro-
cedure (removal, revision, or supplemental fixation) were 
classified as failures for overall success, and the patients’ 
last observations prior to the additional procedure were 
carried forward for all subsequent evaluations of the other 
outcomes.
Results
All surgeries were performed in the period from June 
2006 to November 2007. Patient participation is reported 
in Fig. 1 and patient accountability in Table 2. Data were 
available to assess overall success for 199 of 209 investi-
gational patients and 160 of 188 control patients for fol-
low-up rates of 95.2% and 85.1%, respectively.
Demographic and Preoperative Characteristics
Except for the fact that more investigational than con-
trol patients (69.9% vs 60.1%, p = 0.045) had worked prior 
to surgery, the 2 treatment groups were similar on all other 
demographic characteristics. Likewise, there were no sig-
nificant preoperative differences between the 2 groups in 
the efficacy end points (NDI, SF-36 PCS and MCS, gait, 
and neurological function), medical condition, medical 
history, and medication usage (Table 3).
Surgical Data
All surgical procedures were performed via a stan-
dard extrapharyngeal approach. Blood loss and operative 
time were statistically different between the 2 treatment 
groups. Mean operative time was 2.1 ± 0.8 hours in the 
investigational group, compared with 1.7 ± 0.7 hours in 
the control group (posterior probability of superiority < 
0.001). Blood loss was 67.2 ± 64.1 ml in the investigation-
al group and 55.7 ± 46.3 ml in the control group (posterior 
probability of superiority = 0.019). Length of hospital stay 
was not different between the 2 groups (1.2 ± 0.5 and 1.3 
± 1.0 days). Proportions of inpatients were similar (75.6% 
investigational, 73.4% control). The operative levels were 
most frequently C5–6 and C6–7 (78% investigational, 
75% control, for both levels).
Success Rates for Overall Success and Individual 
Effectiveness End Points
At 24 months after surgery, the observed rates of over-
all success were 81.4% and 69.4% for the investigational 
group and control group, respectively. The posterior mean 
for overall success in the investigational group exceeded 
that in the control group by 0.112 (95% HPD interval = 
0.023 to 0.201) with a posterior probability of essentially 
1 for noninferiority and 0.993 for superiority (Table 4), 
demonstrating the superiority of the investigational group

for overall success. Noninferiority of the investigational 
group was demonstrated for all individual end points ex-
cept for the SF-36 MCS, and superiority was demonstrated 
for NDI.
Clinical Outcomes
Both the investigational and control groups exhibited 
significant preoperative to postoperative improvement in 
scores at all time points for NDI, NRS neck pain, NRS 
arm pain, SF-36 PCS, SF-36 MCS, gait status, and forami-
nal compression (Fig. 2). Improvement in NDI and NRS 
neck pain was greater at all time points for the investiga-
tional group. The NDI score improved from 52.1 ± 13.4 
preoperatively to 15.0 ± 16.6 at the 24-month follow-up for 
the investigational group and from 53.2 ± 14.8 to 20.0 ± 
20.5 for the control group. The neck pain score improved 
from 16.2 ± 2.9 to 4.3 ± 4.9 for the investigational group 
and from 16.3 ± 2.6 to 5.9 ± 5.5 in the control group.
Safety Outcomes
The maintenance or improvement of neurological sta-
tus at 24 months was attained by 91.5% of investigational 
patients and 86.2% of controls. As previously mentioned, 
the rate of neurological success was noninferior in the in-
vestigational group (Table 4).
The proportion of patients experiencing any AE (Table 
5) was 93.3% (195/209) in the investigational group and 
92.0% (173/188) in the control group, which was not sta-
tistically different. The rate of patients who reported any 
serious (Grade 3 or 4) AE was significantly higher in the 
control group (90 [47.9%] of 188) than in the investigation-
al group (72 [34.4%] of 209) with a posterior probability of 
superiority of 0.996 (Table 6). The rates of AEs associated 
with the implant or implant and surgical procedure were 
similar in the 2 groups: 15.8% (33/209) in the investiga-
tional group and 20.7% (39/188) in the control group. The 
rates of Grade 3 or 4 AEs associated with the implant or 
implant and surgical procedure were also similar in the 2 
groups: 1.9% (4/209) in the investigational group and 5.8% 
(11/188) in the control group. The 2 groups also had simi-
lar rates regarding all specific types of AE (FDA hybrid 
AE categories) except for nonunion.
Adverse events that required a second surgery at the 
index levels were considered revisions, removals, supple-
mental fixations, or reoperations. Revision was a proce-
dure to adjust or in any way modify the original implant 
configuration. Removal was a procedure to remove one or 
more components of the original implant configuration

without replacement with the same type of device. Supple-
mental fixation was a procedure to add spinal devices not 
approved as part of the protocol. Reoperation was a pro-
cedure that did not remove, modify, or add any component 
(for instance, decompression or removal of disc material 
and bone fragments). The observed rates of secondary sur-
geries at the index levels were 2.4% (5/209) for the inves-
tigational group and 8.0% (15/188) for the control group, 
(Table 7). The investigational group had a statistically 
lower rate of secondary surgeries than the control group, 
with a posterior probability of superiority of 0.994. There 
were no statistical differences between the 2 groups for 
any subcategory of secondary surgery. Five investigational 
patients (2.4%) and 6 control patients (3.2%) had second-
ary surgeries at adjacent levels.
Radiographic Outcomes
Functional spine unit height was radiographically evalu-
able in 308 patients and was maintained in 93.5% (159/170) 
of the investigational patients and 95.6% (132/138) of 
the control patients (Table 4). Radiographic success was 
achieved in 51.0% (100/196) of the investigational patients 
(as maintenance of motion with no evidence of bridging 
bone) and 82.1% (119/145) of the control patients (as fu-
sion).
Motion at the index (for the investigational group) and 
adjacent levels was measured by comparing lateral flex-
ion and extension radiographs (Fig. 3). Angular motion 
at the superior index level was 6.75° ± 4.16° and 6.92° 
± 3.96° preoperatively and 24 months postoperatively, 
respectively. Angular motion at the inferior index level 
was 5.56° ± 3.89° and 6.85° ± 4.25° preoperatively and 
24 months postoperatively, respectively. The change from 
the preoperative value was not significant for the superior 
index level but was significant (p = 0.001) for the inferior 
index level. Translatory motion at the superior index level 
was 1.48 ± 1.08 mm and 1.33 ± 0.78 mm preoperatively 
and 24 months postoperatively, respectively. Translatory 
motion at the inferior index level was 1.04 ± 0.74 mm and 
1.16 ± 0.71 mm preoperatively and 24 months postop-
eratively, respectively. The change from the preoperative 
value was not significant for either the superior or inferior 
index levels.
For the adjacent level above the treated segments, mean 
preoperative angular motion was 9.89° ± 4.51° for the 
investigational group and 10.02° ± 4.41° for the control 
group. Postoperatively, mean angular motion at the level 
above the treated segments decreased significantly from 
baseline then gradually increased to 11.11° ± 4.76° for the 
investigational group and 11.16° ± 5.13° for the control 
group at 24 months (a significant increase from baseline 
for both groups). Mean preoperative angular motion at the 
adjacent level below the treated segments was consistently 
less than the angular motion at the level above the treated 
segments. Preoperative angular motion at the level below 
the treated segments was 5.02° ± 3.58° for the investiga-
tional group and 4.85° ± 3.32° for the control group. At 
24 months after surgery, these values were 5.14° ± 3.66° 
(investigational) and 6.16° ± 3.88° (control), representing a 
significant increase for the control group.
Translatory motion followed a pattern similar to angu-

significant increase from baseline for both groups. Preop-
erative mean translatory motion at the adjacent segment 
below the treated segments was 1.09 ± 0.64 mm for the 
investigational group and 1.04 ± 0.74 mm for the control 
group. At 24 months, these values were 1.25 ± 0.77 mm 
(investigational) and 1.46 ± 1.03 mm (control), represent-
ing a significant increase for the control group.
Heterotopic Ossification
At 24 months, the presence of any HO was identified in 
27.8% (55/198) of the superior levels and 36.4% (72/198) 
of the inferior levels of investigational patients (Table 8). 
The presence and severity of HO gradually increased over 
the follow-up period. Severe HO (Grade III and IV) re-
stricts motion of the segment and was evident in 3.5% of 
the patients at 6 months, 13.4% at 12 months, and 24.2% 
at 24 months. The incidence of HO did not impact clinical 
outcomes: the success rates were similar for patients with 
and without severe HO (Table 9).
Patient Satisfaction and Perception of Treatment 
Effectiveness
We observed a higher proportion of success in the in-
vestigational group than in the control group regarding 
satisfaction with surgery. Success was defined as respons-
es of “definitely true” or “mostly true” to statements about 
being satisfied with the results of surgery (94.5% inves-
tigational vs 89.3% control), being helped by the surgery 
(93.9% vs 85.5%), and a willingness to have the surgery 
again (93.4% vs 88.7%).
Perceived Effect of Treatment
Similar proportions of patients in the 2 treatment 
groups considered their treatment to be a success. At the 
24-month follow-up, 97% of investigational and 93.7% of 
control patients answered that they were “completely re-
covered,” “much improved,” or “slightly improved.”
Return to Work
Preoperatively, 69.9% (146/209) of investigational pa-
tients and 60.1% (113/188) of control patients reported 
working. At 24 months, 72.9% (145/199) of investigational 
and 71.1% (113/159) of control patients reported working. 
The median return-to-work time after surgery was 49 days 
for investigational patients and 55 days for control patients. 
There was no significant difference between the 2 groups 
(p = 0.48 based on Cox proportional-hazards model ad-
justing for preoperative work status).
Discussion
At 24 months after surgery, overall success rates were 
81.4% for the investigational group and 69.4% for the con-
trol group. Both the noninferiority and superiority of the 
investigational treatment were established, thereby dem-
onstrating that arthroplasty with Prestige LP is at least as 
safe and effective as ACDF for treating DDD at 2 adjacent 
levels in the cervical spine. Besides overall success, great-
er improvement in disability and neck pain was attained 
by the CDA group than the ACDF group. Additionally, the

Grade 1 (mild), AE is noticeable but does not interfere with routine activity or require removal of the implant(s); Grade 2 (moderate), AE interferes with routine activity but responds to symptomatic therapy or rest and does 
not require removal of the implant(s); Grade 3 (severe), AE significantly limits the patient’s ability to perform routine activities despite symptomatic therapy, may require hospitalization, and may require removal of the 
implant(s); Grade 4 (life-threatening), AE requires removal of the implant(s), or the patient is at immediate risk of death, even if the AE is not related to the implant(s).

CDA group underwent fewer secondary surgeries than the 
ACDF group. Although early artificial discs were prone 
to complications,41 currently available artificial discs are 
associated with better safety outcomes and fewer AEs and 
secondary surgeries than ACDF.15,31,35,50 The results of our 
study, in accordance with earlier studies, confirm the non-
inferiority and superiority of multilevel CDA outcomes 
compared with multilevel ACDF.9,14,24
Heterotopic ossification, with its increasing prevalence 
over time, is a well-known occurrence after CDA. Its 
prevalence after 2-level CDA has been found to be higher 
than,55 lower than,23 and similar to10,56 that after single-
level CDA. The prevalence of severe HO (Grade III and 
IV) in the current study was similar to that reported in 
another 2-level CDA IDE trial,14 increasing from 3.5% 
at 6 months to 24.2% at 24 months. In our study, as in

other studies,2,8,11,19,26–28,47 HO did not impact patient out-
comes. Although the long-term impact of HO is not yet 
known,8,11,23,47 it is obviously counter to the goals of CDA, 
which are the maintenance of motion and the avoidance 
or reduction of ASD. Despite the HO, the CDA patients in 
this study underwent fewer adjacent segment surgeries (5 
[2.4%] of 209) than the ACDF patients (6 [3.2%] of 188), 
even though this difference did not reach statistical signifi-
cance. Other studies have also reported fewer adjacent seg-
ment operations after CDA than fusion, up to 7 years after 
surgery.6,15,36 Whether the expected ASD decrease will be 
an “unfulfilled promise”44 due to the progression of severe 
HO following CDA remains to be investigated.
The lack of blinding to treatment, a known source of 
bias, is a limitation of this study. It was not possible to 
blind the physicians because they had to perform the sur-
geries. To reduce physician bias, radiographic and safety 
assessments were conducted by independent reviewers. It 
was also not possible to blind the patients, who were alert-
ed to their surgeries by processing insurance paperwork. 
It has been found that, in the absence of a double-blind 
approach, the investigational treatment is more likely to be 
judged favorably.12,34 Indeed, patients in this study report-
ed greater improvement after CDA than ACDF. However, 
the decompression, which is similar in both control and 
treatment groups, is the part of each surgical procedure 
that is responsible for the reduction in pain and disability. 
Hence, one would expect patients in the 2 groups to report 
similar improvement.49 Studies comparing CDA with fu-
sion15,20,22,36 have generally reported greater reductions in 
pain and disability following CDA with a variety of de-
vices, but not consistently so.15,39,43,50 In the face of unex-
pected patient reports, one cannot rule out the influence of 
bias favoring the investigational treatment, but one should 
also expect such bias to wane once “reality sets in.” In that 
regard, some have noted that the patient-reported differ-
ence between CDA and ACDF has vanished over time,22 
while, remarkably, other patients have continued to report 
superior improvement in the long term, even up to 7 years 
after cervical CDA compared with ACDF.5,6,14 Although 
one cannot rule out the existence of a bias favoring CDA in 
the short term, it seems improbable that bias would remain 
for so many years. In that respect, longer-term follow-up is 
underway to ascertain the longevity of the relative benefits 
of multilevel CDA over ACDF observed in this patient 
sample.
Another limitation of this study is the potential bias that 
may stem from conflicts of interest created by the financial 
relationship between the study sponsor and some investi-
gators. However, several measures were taken to preclude 
the influence of conflicts of interest: all radiological as-
sessments were made by independent reviewers, all AEs 
were evaluated by an independent committee, and all re-
ported statistical analyses were performed by independent 
statisticians. The study sponsor provided the entire raw 
data set to a team of independent statisticians at Vanderbilt 
University. Using the statistical analysis plan in the study 
protocol approved by the FDA, the independent analysis 
team reached the same statistical conclusions as the study 
sponsor for all proposed comparisons.
Finally, it should be noted that this clinical trial includ-
ed patients with intractable radiculopathy or myelopathy or 
both, at 2 adjacent levels. We report the results of the trial 
according to the FDA-approved statistical plan, which did 
not include analyses of pathology subgroups. These analy-
ses and the implications regarding the appropriateness of 
treatment for the pathology subgroups will be addressed in 
a separate publication.
Conclusions
Overall, these findings indicate that CDA using Pres-
tige LP is as effective and safe as ACDF for the treatment 
of cervical DDD at 2 contiguous levels. Hence, it is an al-
ternative treatment for patients with symptoms at 2 adja-
cent levels of the cervical spine.
