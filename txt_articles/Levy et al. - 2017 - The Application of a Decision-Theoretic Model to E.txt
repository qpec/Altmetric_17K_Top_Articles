Abstract
Introduction: The public health impact of vaporized nicotine products (VNPs) such as e-cigarettes 
is unknown at this time. VNP uptake may encourage or deflect progression to cigarette smoking in 
those who would not have otherwise smoked, thereby undermining or accelerating reductions in 
smoking prevalence seen in recent years.
Methods: 
The public health impact of VNP use are modeled in terms of how it alters smoking pat-
terns among those who would have otherwise smoked cigarettes and among those who would not 
have otherwise smoked cigarettes in the absence of VNPs. 
The model incorporates transitions from 
trial to established VNP use, transitions to exclusive VNP and dual use, and the effects of cessation 
at later ages. Public health impact on deaths and life years lost is estimated for a recent birth cohort 
incorporating evidence-informed parameter estimates.
Results: Based on current use patterns and conservative assumptions, we project a reduction of 
21% in smoking-attributable deaths and of 20% in life years lost as a result of VNP use by the 1997 
US birth cohort compared to a scenario without VNPs. In sensitivity analysis, health gains from VNP 
use are especially sensitive to VNP risks and VNP use rates among those likely to smoke cigarettes.
Conclusions: Under most plausible scenarios, VNP use generally has a positive public health 
impact. However, very high VNP use rates could result in net harms. More accurate projections of 
VNP impacts will require better longitudinal measures of transitions into and out of VNP
, cigarette 
and dual use.
Implications: Previous models of VNP use do not incorporate whether youth and young adults 
initiating VNP would have been likely to have been a smoker in the absence of VNPs. This study

provides a decision-theoretic model of VNP use in a young cohort that incorporates tendencies 
toward smoking and shows that, under most plausible scenarios, VNP use yields public health 
gains. 
The model makes explicit the type of surveillance information needed to better estimate the 
effect of new products and thereby inform public policy.
Introduction
The 2014 US Surgeon General’s Report stated that the use of com-
bustible tobacco, primarily cigarettes, is by far the dominant cause 
of the preventable deaths from tobacco use, but also noted that 
e-cigarettes, and variations in this class of noncombustible prod-
ucts, may help to speed the decline of lethal combustible tobacco 
use.1,2 Vaporized nicotine products (VNPs), including e-cigarettes 
and heat-not-burn cigarettes, represent a new generation of nico-
tine delivery products. Although the long-term health risks have yet 
to be thoroughly characterized, VNPs are likely to be much safer 
than cigarettes3–5 and are generally perceived by smokers as less risky 
than cigarettes.6–9 In addition, some types of VNPs have been shown 
to deliver nicotine more efficiently than nicotine replacement prod-
ucts10–13 and provide sensorimotor experiences similar to smoking.
The recent upsurge in VNP awareness and past 30-day use,14,15 
especially among youth, appears to have flattened.16–18 Future uptake 
and use of VNPs will also be influenced by the regulatory context 
in which it is brought to market.19–23 VNPs have been banned in 
some countries while being subject to few or no regulations in other 
countries.24 With “deeming” regulation,25 the US Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) is now confronting the challenge of how to 
regulate VNPs in ways that would be beneficial to public health, 
while recognizing that “sufficient data about e-cigarettes to deter-
mine (VNPs) effect on the public health”25 are not yet available.
If used instead of smoking cigarettes, VNPs provide the potential 
to reduce harm and thereby improve population health.1,26 However, 
VNPs have the potential to increase population-level harm if youth 
who would not have otherwise smoked become cigarette smokers as 
a direct consequence of using VNPs27–32 (ie, a hypothesized gateway) 
or if current smokers who would otherwise have quit smoking ciga-
rettes instead delay or fail to quit.33,34
In the absence of the requisite data, modeling can provide a struc-
ture to analyze the public health impact under different assumptions 
about how VNPs might be used. This paper presents a decision-the-
oretic model of the public health impact of VNP use in the United 
States. Unlike previous models of e-cigarette use,34–36 our model is 
cohort- rather than age-based. While cohorts may differ in terms of 
awareness, perceived risks, products available (eg, flavorings, ability 
to satisfy nicotine cravings), and user characteristics (eg, early vs. 
late adopters, high vs. low income), we model the potential impact 
of VNP initiation on VNP and cigarette use using a recent cohort of 
young people.
The model improves on previous work by explicitly modeling 
the decisions that individuals make at each age regarding VNP use 
and comparing that use to a no-VNP use scenario based on an age-
period-cohort analysis.37 We project the likely future impact of VNPs 
based on the best available evidence. Sensitivity analysis is used to 
discern the trade-off between harm-reducing and harm-increasing 
effects of VNP use on net public health and to identify the specific 
parameters that contribute to the net effect of VNPs. Our analysis 
also identifies the kind of data that are needed to better evaluate the 
public health impact of VNP use.
Methods
The analysis is confined to patterns of VNP and cigarette use, since 
cigarette smoking is the dominant threat to public health.1,2 Using 
data on smoking rates prior to when VNPs were introduced, we 
describe a hypothetical “No-VNP scenario” as the projection of 
future smoking rates in the absence of VNPs. We then consider a 
hypothetical, data-informed VNP use scenario where patterns of 
VNP use and associated cigarette smoking interact to influence 
health outcomes. Public health implications are derived in terms of 
the change in smoking-related mortality and life years gained or lost 
between the two scenarios.
The “No-VNP Scenario”
To estimate smoking rates in the absence of VNP use, we analyze 
a cohort of current, former, and never smokers in the United States 
using data through 2012. The data were developed38 by applying 
an age-period-cohort statistical technique37 to National Health 
Interview Surveys (NHIS) from 1965–2012 while correcting for bias 
due to higher mortality among smokers. Since sustained VNP use 
was still low in 2012,14 the NHIS data are used to approximate ciga-
rette smoking trends prior to VNPs.
A representative cohort of individuals aged 15 years in 2012 
(born in 1997) was chosen, since most initiation into smoking takes 
place beginning at age 15.39 Projected initiation and cessation rates 
are used to calculate current, former, and never smoker prevalence 
through the year 2083 in the absence of VNPs. Never smokers 
become current smokers reflecting their initiation at each age, with 
some percentage of smokers who are alive at a given age becoming 
former smokers as a result of cessation. Cessation is measured as the 
percent quit for 2 years to approximate net cessation, taking into 
account relapse rates.38
VNP Scenarios
The VNP model includes (1) established use of VNPs alone, (2) ciga-
rettes alone, (3) dual use of VNPs and cigarettes, and (4) nonuse of 
either. “Established use” is conceptualized as long enough for meas-
ureable harms to accumulate, which typically requires years of use for 
cigarettes.40 Established dual user refers to frequent use of both prod-
ucts (eg, at least weekly), since occasional use of one (eg, once in the 
past month) and regular use of the other is unlikely to materially affect 
risk profiles. While established use of VNPs and cigarettes is used to 
determine health outcomes, short-term (“trial”) use of VNPs is incor-
porated as a direct pathway into established use, since most estimates 
of VNP use in the literature (eg use at least once in the past 30 days) 
are likely to reflect primarily short-term rather than long-term use.41,42
Potential transitions and public health impacts are distinguished 
relative to the No-VNP scenario of otherwise smokers (ie, those who 
would have become smokers without VNPs being on the market) 
and otherwise nonsmokers. As shown in Figure 1, green endpoints 
indicate harm-reducing and red endpoints indicating harm-increas-
ing endpoints. VNP use is harm-reducing for those who would have

otherwise smoked and instead become exclusive or dual VNP users, 
or use and then quit VNPs without smoking. Harm is increased for 
those who would not have otherwise smoked cigarettes and transi-
tion to long-term cigarette use as a direct result of VNP use or transi-
tion to established exclusive VNP cigarette or dual use.
To distinguish public health implications, we differentiate transi-
tions by those who would have otherwise initiated smoking at each 
age from those who would have remained nonsmokers. To avoid 
double counting of those individuals who would not have otherwise 
have smoked, we use the smoking prevalence at the peak age (age 25 
with smoking prevalence 19%) in the No-VNP model to determine 
the population of nonsmokers who engage in trial use.
We assume that individuals progress from trial use into a single 
state of exclusive cigarette, exclusive VNP, dual, or no use. While 
this assumption is made for model tractability, transitions to and 
from smoking abstinence are rarely smooth; many experiment with 
a product and do not transition to established use, or have periods 
of experimentation alternating with periods of use before transition-
ing to a stable state.43,44 The model could be extended to incorporate 
multiple transitions, but the resultant use rates are critical, rather 
than the details of how they occur. After age 25, cessation of exclu-
sive cigarette, VNP, and dual use is assumed to occur at the rate of 
smoking cessation under the No-VNP scenario. However, we con-
sider cases where cessation rates of dual and/or exclusive smokers 
increase (eg, due to VNP availability) or decrease.
Assumptions and their justifications are shown in Supplementary 
Table 1.
“Base Case” VNP Scenario
The transitions in Figure 1 under the VNP scenario were developed 
using estimates from recent literature. We chose estimates that imply 
more conservative effects (ie, outcomes that yield less harm reduc-
tion), with the percent following each path shown in Figure 1 and 
described in Supplementary Table 2.
In a large 2014 nationally representative US sample of 17- to 
18-year-old students,42 7% of those who never smoked had used an 
e-cigarette in the last month compared to about 50% of those who 
had regularly or occasionally smoked. In other US studies, the odds 
of current youth e-cigarette use by smokers was 7.9 compared to 
nonsmokers,45 young adult current e-cigarette use was 31% among 
smokers compared to 10% among former smokers and 2% among 
never smokers,46 and the odds of college student e-cigarette use rela-
tive to never smokers was 3.1 for ever smokers and 6.6 for current 
smokers.47 VNP users have also been found to be those who are 
more susceptible to smoking.48–50 Based on the combined use of 
youth and young adults, we estimate that 80% of otherwise smokers 
try VNPs and 20% of otherwise nonsmokers try VNPs, a 4:1 ratio.
Of 17- to 18-year-old past month e-cigarette users,42 32% of 
never smokers used e-cigarettes 6 or more days compared to 50% 
among those who occasionally or regularly smoked cigarettes. 
Similar results were found in a recent study of 17–18 year olds51 and 
studies of adults.46,52,53 While these studies do not distinguish oth-
erwise smokers from otherwise nonsmokers, VNP users have been 
found to have similar profiles to cigarette smokers (eg, common 
risk behaviors47,54,55 and higher rates of executive function deficits, 
parental and peer cigarette use56). Based on these studies, particularly 
the large scale 2014 sample of 17–18 year olds,42 we estimate that 
50% of smokers and 25% of nonsmokers who try VNPs progress to 
established use, implying that 40% (80% * 50%) of all smokers and 
5% (20% * 25%) of nonsmokers become established VNP users, 
an 8:1 ratio.
Of 17–18 year olds, 24% of those currently smoking at least 
half a pack per day used VNPs 6 or more days compared to 31% of 
never smokers.42 Another study54 obtained a prevalence of 17% for 
exclusive VNP use compared to 12% for dual use, with both group 
exhibiting similar risk factors to exclusive cigarette users. Among 
adults who used VNPs in the last month, one study52 found that 
41% of current, but 51% of former, smokers were regular users, and

another17 found close to 70% of recent former smokers were daily 
users compared to about 23% of current smokers and less than 1% 
of never smokers. Since none of the studies indicated that more than 
50% of regular users were current smokers and the studies do not 
provide evidence to explicitly distinguish otherwise smokers from 
otherwise nonsmokers, we estimate that established VNP users are 
split between dual users and exclusive VNP users for both otherwise 
smokers and otherwise nonsmokers.
In the absence of evidence on VNP users who do not continue 
to established use, we estimate that 5% of otherwise nonsmokers 
become smokers and 5% of otherwise smokers become nonsmok-
ers. Among those not trying VNPs, we assume no change in status 
among otherwise smokers and nonsmokers.
We consider variations for each of the potential transitions by 
otherwise smokers and otherwise nonsmokers in the VNP base case 
to gauge sensitivity. Holding all other parameters constant, we con-
sider trial use rates among otherwise smokers to vary between 0% 
and 100%. We then individually consider variations for trial use 
rates among otherwise smokers holding all other parameters con-
stant. Similarly, we consider transitions from trial to established use 
and transitions from established use to dual use for both otherwise 
nonsmokers and otherwise smokers.
Health Outcomes
All-cause cohort life tables by age, cohort, and sex were calculated 
by cigarette smoking status (never, former, and current) using mor-
tality relative risk estimates by sex and smoking status derived from 
the American Cancer Society Cancer Prevention Studies I and II par-
titioned by smoking status.38 Excess risk was calculated by age and 
gender as the mortality rate for smokers—mortality rate for never 
smokers and similarly for former smokers.
Although the long-term implications are not yet known and will 
likely vary by product,3,57–59 VNPs contain substantially lower levels 
of toxic substances59–62 and are thus likely to be much lower risk 
than cigarettes.3–5 A multidecision analysis estimated that exclusive 
VNP use is associated with 5% of the risks of exclusive cigarette 
use,5 similar to the risks of low-nitrosamine smokeless tobacco 
(snus) use.63 Since lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease risk are sensitive to smoking duration and intensity,64,65 dual 
users may have lower mortality risk than exclusive cigarette smokers 
if VNP use delays smoking initiation or reduces the average quan-
tity smoked. While some studies of VNP use report reductions in 
cigarette use of more than 50%,9,66–70 others indicate smaller reduc-
tions, especially among nondaily VNP users.71,72 A review found 
75%–80% lower cigarette consumption among dual cigarette and 
snus users than among exclusive smokers.73
We estimate that among those who are exclusive VNP users the 
excess health risk is 5% whereas among dual users of cigarettes and 
VNPs the excess risk is 70% of cigarette only users. We also consider 
risks at 2.5% and 50% (low), 10% and 85% (medium), and 25% 
and 100% (high) for exclusive and dual use, respectively. Excess 
risks for former dual and exclusive VNP users are assumed to decline 
by the same percentages as applied to the difference in risk between 
current and former smokers.
Calculation of Lives and Life 
Years Lost
For the No-VNP scenario, the number of smoking-attributable 
deaths (SADs) is calculated for current and former smokers for 
each age in the 1997 cohort as the product of excess risks and the 
corresponding population (projected US population74 multiplied 
by the prevalence rate). The number of life years lost (LYL) at each 
age is estimated as the product of number of premature deaths and 
the expected years of life remaining for a never smoker. For each 
VNP scenario, SADs and LYL are calculated for current and former 
exclusive smokers, exclusive VNP users and dual users, at each age 
and then summed. The public health impact of VNP use is measured 
by the difference in SADs and LYL under the No-VNP and VNP 
scenario.
Results
No-VNP Versus VNP Scenarios
Table 1 contains male and female smoking and VNP prevalence, 
smoking-attributable deaths and LYL under the No-VNP scenario 
and the evidence-informed VNP scenarios. The 1997 cohort at age 
15 years in 2012 includes 2 118 400 males and 2 025 700 females 
(Supplementary Table 3).
Under the No-VNP scenario, male smoking prevalence at age 15 
is 4.6% increasing to 20.4% at age 25, and declining to 5.6% at age 
65, while female prevalence at age 15 is 2.7% increasing to 14.3% 
at age 25, and declining to 3.5% at age 65. A cumulative total of 79 
300 SADs and 1 539 200 LYL are estimated for males and 21 600 
SADs and 419 100 LYL for females, a total of 100 900 deaths and 1 
958 300 LYL from smoking in the 1997 birth cohort.
Under the VNP base case scenario, exclusive smoking is reduced 
by age 25 to 12.4% for males and 8.9% for females, but is off-
set through increased dual (5.9% males and 4.9% for females) and 
exclusive VNP dual (male 5.9% and female 4.9%) use. The cumu-
lative loss through age 85 is 61 000 SADs and 1 208 000 LYL for 
males and 17 500 SADs and 350 000 LYL for females. Compared to 
the No-VNP scenario, a net public health gain of 23% fewer male 
and 19% fewer female SADs and 21.5% fewer male and 16.6% 
fewer female LYLs are projected. With low VNP mortality risks, 
28% fewer SADs and 26% fewer LYL are projected. The gains 
decrease to 15% fewer SADs and 14% fewer LYL with medium risks 
and 6% fewer SADs and 5% fewer LYL with high risks.
If cessation rates are reduced by 10% in later years (Table 1 and 
Supplementary Table 4), male LYL increase by 2475 (−0.20% lower 
than with no effect on cessation for the evidence-informed risk esti-
mates) if only smokers are affected and by 3181 (0.26%) if dual 
users are also affected. A 10% cessation increase yields a male life 
year gain of 2042 (0.17) if only affecting smokers and 2769 (0.23%) 
if also affecting dual users. Changes for females are slightly larger, 
as much as 0.40%.
Sensitivity Analysis
The sensitivity of results is assessed by changing individual param-
eters while holding constant other parameters at the base VNP lev-
els. Parameter sensitivity is gauged by the variability (from 0% to 
100%) in combined male and female LYL as that parameter changes. 
Gender variations are shown in Supplementary Figures 1–3 and in 
Supplementary Table 5.
Holding constant the other parameters (including use by oth-
erwise nonsmokers and rates of exclusive and dual VNP use and 
established use rates), the public health impact on otherwise smok-
ers (Figure 2) for trial use increased from 93 000 LYL at 0% use to 
a net gain of 525 000 life years gained at 100% use, with break-
even where VNP trial use equals 15%. At less than 15% trial use

by otherwise smokers, the LYL due to use by otherwise nonsmok-
ers (held constant at the evidence-informed level) dominates. For 
otherwise nonsmokers, the public health impact declines from 519 
000 life years gained to 134 000 LYL, with breakeven when VNP 
trial use reaches 80%. Thus, 80% of otherwise nonsmokers would 
be required to seriously experiment with VNPs for overall public 
health harm with our best estimate of risks, and 30% of otherwise 
nonsmokers would be required to seriously experiment with VNPs 
for the high level of risks. Notably, as gauged by absolute value of 
their slopes between 0% and 100%, the public health impact is less

sensitive among otherwise nonsmokers than otherwise smokers at 
the lower levels of risk, but becomes less sensitive at the higher levels 
of VNP risk, as expected.
Increasing established use (Figure 3) also increases the gain 
among otherwise smokers while decreasing the gain among other-
wise nonsmokers. Holding constant the other parameters, LYL is 
10 000 at 0% established use by those otherwise smokers who try 
VNPs and reaches over 800 000 life years gained at 100% estab-
lished use. Breakeven from LYL is at or near zero at the two lower 
levels of VNP risk, and at 10% for the medium and 25% at the high 
level of VNP risk. The tipping point with for otherwise nonsmokers 
is at or near 100% for the three lower levels of risk, and at 45% for 
the high risk level. The sensitivity to use levels is greater among oth-
erwise smokers than among otherwise nonsmokers at lower risks, 
but reverses at higher risks.
Figure 4 shows that the LYL as dual use among established users 
increases from 0% to 100% while exclusive VNP use concurrently 
declines from 100% to 0%. As expected, increasing dual use leads to 
decreasing health gains from VNP use among both otherwise smok-
ers and otherwise nonsmokers. The sensitivity among otherwise 
smokers as measured by the absolute value of the slope increases 
at higher risk levels, but changes little for otherwise nonsmokers. 
Among otherwise smokers, the tipping point to LYL is slightly less 
than 100% dual use (ie, no exclusive VNP use) for medium risk and 
at 75% for high risk. Among otherwise nonsmokers with all other 
levels of use held constant, public harm (negative life years gained) 
is projected as dual use increases above 50% for the highest level 
of risk.
Discussion
The VNP decision-theoretic model of initiation shows that, while 
vaping leads to some VNP use and smoking by those who would 
not have otherwise smoked, the negative public health impact may 
be offset by the benefits from greater use of VNPs among otherwise 
smokers who smoke less or not at all. Under evidence-based estimates 
based on current use patterns, we estimate that 21% of SADs and 
20% of LYL would be averted as a result of VNP use for a single 
cohort. Moreover, public health gains are estimated over a wide range 
of plausible parameters and use rates. A large proportion of VNP ini-
tiation leading directly to more cigarette smoking by otherwise never 
smokers or an increase in the magnitude of harms from VNPs relative 
to cigarettes (or both) would be required before a tipping point is 
reached where harms begin to exceed benefits at the population level.
While the high VNP risk estimates imply less health gains from 
VNP use, VNPs are likely to be increasingly regulated for quality con-
trol, thereby reducing levels and variability in risks. We expect that 
the highest risk estimates that we modeled are unlikely. Regulations 
that reduce risks and accurately communicate ingredients and 
nicotine levels in VNPs can be expected to encourage switching to 
exclusive VNP use and thus reduce the harms associated with smok-
ing. A regulatory balance is needed that protects the public from

constant, including trial and dual use.

avoidable harms while at the same time allowing for innovation in 
VNPs that encourage the substitution of VNPs for cigarettes.
Sensitivity analysis also showed that those with a higher propen-
sity to smoke (“otherwise smokers”) are especially sensitive to VNP 
use rates, suggesting the need for stronger tobacco control efforts to 
discourage combustible use (eg, increase cigarette and cigar taxes, 
higher minimum purchase age laws,75 targeting combustible use in 
prevention and cessation media campaigns, and stricter smoke-free 
air laws). These policies would not only discourage transitions to 
combustible use but encourage switching to exclusive VNP use by 
those who otherwise cannot or will not quit combustible product use 
at early ages. Nevertheless, policies are needed to discourage youth 
initiation, especially by otherwise nonsmokers into any tobacco or 
VNP use. These policies may include higher and better enforced 
minimum purchase age laws marketing restrictions and VNP taxes 
although proportional to harms of combustible use.75,76
Because of our focus on initiation and the recent cohort analyzed, 
the effects of VNPs through later cessation, as expected, played a 
minimal role. By assumption, the transitions to VNP use occurred 
largely at earlier ages. For older cohorts that have initiated smoking 
before VNPs were more widely used (eg, those aged 26 or older in 
2012), VNPs can potentially play a key role in encouraging smoking 
cessation; smokers who began smoking before VNPs were readily 
available can benefit from switching to exclusive VNP use, especially 
at younger ages when cessation from cigarettes is typically low77 and 
health benefits from cessation are high.78
Thus, a careful balance must be struck that maximizes potential 
benefits by encouraging VNP use among otherwise smokers while 
minimizing harms to those who would not have otherwise smoked 
or who would have otherwise quit.1,2 Given the disproportionate 
power of the tobacco industry in this market space, there is a strong 
need for clear and accurate education of the public about the relative 
harms of each class of products and what behaviors substantially 
reduce or eliminate those harms. Ongoing longitudinal postmarket 
surveillance is needed to detect early warning signs of unintended 
negative consequences especially at early ages.
The decision-theoretic model has several limitations. As with 
all models of this nature, the projected public health gains depend 
on assumptions and the parameter estimates chosen for the model. 
While public health gains depend on the parameters chosen for the 
model, our aim was to apply conservative estimates of use by other-
wise smokers and otherwise nonsmokers. For example, a recent meta-
analysis79 found that current smokers had 15 times the odds of current 
e-cigarette use compared to nonsmokers, increasing to 39 times the 
odds for adolescents. We also estimated that 25% of otherwise non-
smokers progressed to established VNP use and 50% of those became 
dual users, both of which we expect are overly pessimistic estimates.80
The empirical estimates we have used to inform the model are 
from the early stages in the use of these products. It is likely that cur-
rent estimates underestimate eventual use, but short of a consensus 
estimate of likely trends, we have taken the conservative approach 
of using the most current data. If usage declines, then the estimates 
of benefits will also decline.
We considered cessation by the 1989 cohort, but we limited 
our analysis to changes in cessation at later ages among dual and 
exclusive VNP users. Similar effects may be expected among ciga-
rette smokers, suggesting that the estimated gains from VNP use may 
be understated. In addition, we have assumed a single transition to 
Figure 3. Vaporized nicotine product (VNP) established use sensitivity analysis among never smokers. Sensitivity analysis is conducted holding other use 
parameters constant, including established and dual use.

the final state. In measuring transitions to established use, it will be 
important for future studies to allow for the possibility that transi-
tions, for example, from dual use to exclusive VNP use, may occur 
later in life.
The use of other tobacco products, such as cigars, water pipe, and 
smokeless tobacco, may also influence the patterns of VNP and ciga-
rette use. Cigar, smokeless tobacco, and hookah use has increased in 
recent years,2 especially among youth.16,18 However, unless long-term 
use of these products markedly increases, we expect that inclusion of 
these tobacco products is unlikely to substantially change the results.
Results of our model should not be strictly compared to others 
that address e-cigarette use.34–36 The various models that have been 
developed so far differ in their structure, population focus, and mod-
eling methods. Whereas we focused on a specific age cohort, other 
models34,36 have attempted to generalize to the entire US population. 
In addition, we model a process dependent on whether the individual 
is an otherwise smoker or otherwise nonsmoker, while other models 
have focused on behavioral transitions between tobacco product use 
states. Nevertheless, our results are broadly consistent with the models 
of Cobb et al.35 and Cherng et al.36 The differences from Kalkhoran 
and Glantz model34 appear to result from their higher rates of initia-
tion into smoking implied by VNP use and higher levels of VNP risks.
The model highlights which transitions will need to be studied 
more closely to more accurately determine the effects of VNPs and 
evaluate policies affecting VNPs. The initial branch in Figure 1 leads 
to hypothetical states which cannot be observed and are inferred 
from past smoking patterns. While some studies have examined 
the relationship of VNP use to smoking,45,81,82 these have been 
cross-sectional or relatively short-term and alternative explanations, 
such as shared common vulnerabilities and other confounders, can-
not be omitted.31,83,84 Needed are better measures of trial use taking 
into account variations in the cigarette-oriented and VNP-oriented 
policies that are in place.
In conclusion, our analysis suggests the likelihood of public 
health gains due to VNP use at early ages under most plausible 
scenarios, and sensitivity analysis provides an indication of tipping 
points where harms will exceed benefits. The possibility of public 
health harms exceeding benefits must be carefully monitored via 
national longitudinal surveillance in order to protect public health 
via prudent regulation and timely policymaking. Better information 
is needed for proven measures of trial and established use and on the 
long-term trajectories of those who try VNPs in terms of whether 
they would have otherwise initiated or continued to smoke. As bet-
ter information becomes available, the model presented here can be 
updated and should be able to provide more accurate estimates of 
the public health impact of VNP use.
