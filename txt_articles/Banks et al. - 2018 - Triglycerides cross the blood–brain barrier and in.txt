OBJECTIVE: Resistance at the brain receptors for leptin and insulin has been associated with increased feeding, obesity and
cognitive impairments. The causal agent for central resistance is unknown but could be derived from the blood. Here we postulate
whether hypertriglyceridemia, the major dyslipidemia of the metabolic syndrome, could underlie central leptin and insulin
resistance.
DESIGN: We used radioactively labeled triglycerides to measure blood–brain barrier (BBB) penetration, western blots to measure
receptor activation, and feeding and cognitive tests to assess behavioral endpoints.
RESULTS: Human CSF was determined to contain triglycerides, a finding previously unclear. The radioactive triglyceride triolein
readily crossed the BBB and centrally administered triolein and peripherally administered lipids induced in vivo leptin and/or insulin
resistance at hypothalamic receptors. Central triolein blocked the satiety effect of centrally administered leptin. Decreasing serum
triglycerides with gemfibrozil improved both learning and memory inversely proportionate to triglyceride levels.
CONCLUSIONS: Triglycerides cross the blood–brain barrier rapidly, are found in human cerebrospinal fluid, and induce central
leptin and insulin receptor resistance, decreasing satiety and cognition.

INTRODUCTION
Leptin is a pluripotent regulatory protein that is secreted by
adipose tissue and, crossing the blood–brain barrier (BBB), acts at
its receptors in the brain to induce anorexia, increase thermogen-
esis, and support a number of central nervous system (CNS)-
mediated actions related to cognition.1–5 A lack of leptin action in
the brain, whether caused by the absence of the protein, an
inability to cross the BBB (peripheral resistance), or resistance at its
CNS receptor (central resistance), will result in profound obesity.6,7
In humans, obesity is characterized not by an absence of leptin
but by a resistance to its actions.8,9 The cause of leptin resistance
at its CNS receptor is unknown, but it is possibly a blood-derived
factor that arises with the development of obesity.
Insulin is a peptide derived from the pancreas that crosses the
BBB to affect feeding and cognition.10 Insulin resistance, especially
CNS insulin resistance, is increasingly associated with cognitive
impairment in general and Alzheimer’s disease in particular.11–13
Delivery of insulin to the brain has been shown to rapidly improve
some aspects of cognition in individuals with Alzheimer’s disease
and in young adults.14,15 The cause of CNS insulin resistance is
unknown, but its association with obesity, diabetes mellitus, and
the metabolic syndrome are consistent with the involvement of a
blood-derived factor.
Triglycerides could be that blood-derived factor. With fasting,
serum triglycerides decrease, as they are used by peripheral tissues
as an energy source. With prolonged fasting and during starvation,
triglycerides are mobilized from adipose tissue,16 increasing blood
levels of free fatty acids.17 Blood triglyceride levels also increase and
their source is likely the liver. In the fasting/starved state, circulating
free fatty acids are rapidly taken up by liver and reappear in the
circulation as triglycerides.18,19 Elevated blood triglycerides may
have evolved as a starvation signal to the brain, with triglyceride-
induced leptin resistance promoting survival by increasing the
feeding drive and decreasing caloric expenditures that are unrelated
to seeking calories. Triglycerides can indeed impair leptin transport
across the BBB, inducing peripheral resistance.20 Hypertriglyceride-
mia is the classic dyslipidemia of obesity and the obesity-related
conditions of metabolic syndrome and type II diabetes mellitus.21 In
obesity, the hypertriglyceridemia-induced leptin resistance that
promoted survival in starvation would be detrimental as it would
promote continued feeding. Triglycerides are directly associated
with the cognitive impairment associated with leptin-resistant
conditions, including obesity and type II diabetes mellitus.22,23
These
direct
effects
on
cognition
raise
the
possibility
that
triglycerides can induce central leptin resistance. Similarly, several
lines of evidence connect Alzheimer’s disease with triglycerides,
dyslipidemia, and apolipoprotein E dysfunctions.24
However, we could find little information about the occurrence
of triglycerides in the cerebrospinal fluid25 and no assessment on
their ability to cross the BBB. Here, we determined the presence of
triglycerides in human CSF, and in mice their ability to cross the
BBB and to alter leptin and insulin brain receptor functions.

 and the Veterans Affairs Puget Sound Health Care System. Written
informed consent was obtained from all participants. A total of 39 subjects
were fasted overnight, were aged 68 ± 1.04 years, had a BMI 28 ± 0.6
kg m − 2, 20 (51%) subjects were female and 21 (53%) had the diagnosis of
mild cognitive impairment. To obtain CSF, the L4-L5 space was accessed
with a 24-gauge Sprott spinal needle (Sprott; Pajunk), and 30 ml of CSF was
withdrawn into sterile syringes. Samples were divided into aliquots in
prechilled polyethylene tubes, immediately frozen with dry ice, and stored
at − 70 °C until assays were performed. Colorimetric kit ‘L-Type Triglyceride
M’ (Wako Diagnostics, Moutain View, CA, USA) was used to measure
triglyceride levels and read in a standard plate reader at 620 nm at 37 °C.
Passage of triglycerides across the BBB
Male mice from our in-house colony (John Cochran VA, St Louis, MO, USA)
were anesthetized with urethane and the right jugular vein and the left
carotid artery exposed. 106 dpm of 3H-triolein (American Radiolabeled
Chemicals, Inc. St. Louis, MO, USA) was injected into the jugular vein. At 2,
10 and 20 min after the iv injection, blood was obtained from the carotid
artery and the mouse immediately decapitated. The levels of radioactivity
were determined in arterial serum and whole brain by beta counting and
results expressed as brain/serum ratios.
Preparation of triolein micelles
Triolein and L-phosphatidylcholine (Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co., St Louis,
MO, USA) were each dissolved in chloroform, mixed, and dried under a
stream of nitrogen gas.20 Zlokovic’s buffer (pH 7.4; 7.19 g l − 1 NaCl,
0.3 g l − 1 KCl, 0.28 g l − 1 CaCl2, 2.1 g l − 1 NaHCO3, 0.16 g l − 1 KH2PO4,
0.17 g l − 1 anhydrous MgCl2, 0.99 g l − 1
D-glucose and 10 g l − 1 bovine
serum albumin (BSA; which was added on the day of use) was added and
the material vigorously mixed, homogenized and alternatively frozen in
liquid nitrogen and thawed in a warm water bath for 12 cycles. The
resulting lipid micelles were diluted to the desired concentration and used
immediately or stored at minus 20 °C for use within 48 h.
Radioactive labeling of leptin and insulin
Recombinant murine leptin (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) or
insulin was labeled by the chloramine-T method.3 Briefly, 5 microg of leptin
or insulin was mixed with 1 mCi of 125I in a volume of 45 microl of 0.25 mM
chloride-free sodium phosphate solution (pH 7.5). A volume of 5 μl of
freshly prepared chloramine-T (2 mg ml − 1 in sodium phosphate buffer)
was added and mixed for 60 s at room temperature. The radioactively
labeled leptin or insulin was separated from unincorporated iodine by
purification on a G-10 column.
Effects of intracerebroventricular triglycerides on CNS leptin or
insulin signaling
On day of study, male, 6–8-week-old CD-1 mice were fasted for 6 h the
morning of the experiment. First, a dose–response curve was constructed
for leptin in mice that were anesthetized with 40% urethane. Control mice
received vehicle only and other mice received 1 μl of vehicle containing
either 1 ng, 10 ng, 100 ng or 1 μg of leptin or 10 ng, 100 ng, 1 μg or 5 μg of
human insulin into the lateral ventricle of the brain. These intracerebro-
ventricular (ICV) injections were performed by reflecting the scalp and
drilling a hole 1 mm lateral and 0.5 mm posterior to the bregma, followed
by injection at a depth of 2.5 mm using a 26 g Hamilton syringe.
Second, the effect of triolein on leptin signaling as measured by the
pSTAT3/STAT3 ratio was determined in three groups: mice receiving
vehicle ICV, mice receiving 100 ng of leptin ICV, and mice receiving an ICV
injection of 1 μl triglycerides (180 mg ml − 1) 15 min prior to the ICV
injection of leptin. Mice were killed 30 min after the second ICV injection.
For insulin signaling, a similar protocol was used except that 1 μg of insulin
rather than leptin was injected, mice were killed at 10 min after the second
ICV injection, and the pAKT/AKT ratio was measured.
For analysis of pAKT and pSTAT3, supernatants were prepared from
hypothalamic tissues dissolved in 100 μl of lysis buffer (PBS with 1% Triton
X-1000, 5 mM EDTA, 1 mM PMSF, and protease and phosphatase inhibitor
cocktail) and were resolved on a 4–12% Bis-Tris gel (Invitrogen, Grand
Island, NY, USA). Protein was then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes
using an iBlot transfer device (Invitrogen) and blocked for 1 h in 5% BSA
dissolved in TBS-T. All antibody incubations were done at 4 °C overnight.
The membranes were probed with an anti-pAKT or pSTAT3 rabbit
monoclonal antibody (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA USA). Membranes were
then washed, and probed with anti-rabbit secondary antibody conjugated
to horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA,
USA). Following band visualization, blots were stripped. Blots were then re-
probed with an anti-AKT mouse monoclonal antibody or anti-STAT3 rabbit
monoclonal antibody (Cell Signaling), washed, and probed with anti-
mouse or rabbit secondary (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Band
intensities for phosphor-antibodies were then normalized to total antibody
signal and made relative to the vehicle control. All immunoreactive bands
were visualized using West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Thermo
Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA) and all images were captured using an
ImageQuant LAS4000 CCD imaging system (GE Life Sciences, Piscataway,
NJ, USA). Densitometric analysis was done using IQTL software (GE Life
Sciences, Piscataway, NJ, USA).
Effect of triolein on brain distribution of ICV administered leptin
I-Lep was injected into the lateral ventricle of the brain as previously
described in a volume of 1 μl of lactated Ringer’s solution. Triolein at a
concentration of 180 mg ml − 1 was included in the ICV injection. Arterial
serum from the carotid artery was obtained 15 min after the ICV injection
and then mice were immediately decapitated, the olfactory bulb collected
and the whole brain dissected into 10 brain regions according to the
method of Glowinski and Iverson.26 Brain regions were weighed and the
levels of radioactivity determined.
Effect of triolein on leptin-induced anorexia
Mice were 12-week-old male CD-1 mice obtained from Charles River
(Wilmington, MA, USA). Mice were adapted after transport from Charles
River by giving food and water on an ad lib basis in rooms with a 12 h ligh–
dark cycle with lights on at 0600 hours. Forty-eight hours prior to testing,
the mice were anesthetized with isoflurane, placed in a stereotaxic
instrument, and the scalp was deflected. A unilateral hole was drilled
0.5 mm posterior to and 1.0 mm to the right of the bregma. The injection
depth was 2.0 mm into the third ventricle. Mice were individually housed
and food deprived overnight before study. Fifteen minutes prior to the
introduction of food, the mice were again placed under light anesthesia,
and injected ICV with drug or vehicle. Two injections of 1 μl each, the first

 being 180 μg triolein or vehicle (Zlokovics buffer) and the second being
0.5 μg leptin or vehicle, were delivered over 30 s through a 30 gauge
needle, which was attached to a 10 μl syringe. After the ICV injections, the
scalp was closed and the mice were returned to their cages. Mice were
given food of a known amount 15 min post injection, which was weighed
4 and 24 h later.
Gemfibrozil effects on cognition, brain weight and body weight
Retired breeders from our in-house colony (John Cochran VA, St Louis, MO,
USA) were randomized into two groups given either gemfibrozil orally
1 g/kg dissolved in vegetable oil twice daily or vehicle. After 2 weeks,
acquisition was measured in the active avoidance T-maze and after
another 1 week of treatment, retention was measured. Higher T-maze
scores reflect impaired acquisition (learning) and retention (memory). Mice
were weighed at the beginning of treatment and after the measure of
retention. Mice were then killed and brains weighed.
Effects of peripherally administered lipids on CNS leptin signaling
One mililiter of either whole milk or nonfat milk was administered
intraperitoneally (IP) at t = 0, 1h or 2 h. Four hours after the first IP injection,
mice were anesthetized with urethane and received an ICV injection of
lactated Ringer’s with or without 100 ng of leptin. Thirty minutes after the
ICV injection, the hypothalamus was collected to determine leptin
signaling as above. In additional animals, 106 dpm of tritiated triolein
was included in the IP injections and the level of radioactivity measured in
brain regions and serum 4 h after the first IP injection. The results for this
part of the study are reported as the percent of the radioactive dose found
in a gram of brain or ml of serum.
Statistics
Means are reported with their n’s and s.e., including those for the human
CSF parameters. Two means were compared by t-test and more than two
means were compared by analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by
Newman–Keuls multiple comparisons test. ANOVAs are reported with their
degrees of freedom and P values. Regression lines were computed by the
least squares method using the Prism 5 statistical package (GraphPad Inc.,
San Diego, CA, USA).
RESULTS
Triglycerides were present in low amounts in human cerebrospinal
fluid obtained from a convenience sample, having a mean level of
0.65 ± 0.06 mg dl − 1 (n = 39, Figure 1a). To determine whether
triglycerides could cross the BBB, we injected radioactive triolein
into the jugular vein of the mouse and obtained the whole brain
and blood from the carotid artery 2, 10 or 20 min later. Brain/
serum ratios (Figure 1b) showed a rapid uptake of tritiated triolein
into the brain. Radioactivity obtained from brains in which the
vascular space had been washed out eluted in the position of
tritiated triolein on thin layer chromatography, demonstrating that
it was intact triolein and not the free fatty acid oleate or the
glycerol backbone that had crossed the BBB.
We then determined whether trigylcerides could induce leptin
resistance in the brain. We first injected leptin into the lateral
ventricle of the brain to determine the dose needed to induce
phosphorylation of STAT3 by the hypothalamic leptin receptor
(Figure 2a ANOVA: F(4,14) = 6.1, Po0.01). The dose–response
curve indicated that 100 ng per mouse induced partial activation
of the leptin receptor. To determine whether triglycerides could

 induce leptin receptor resistance, 100 ng of leptin was injected
into the lateral ventricle of the brain with or without triolein
(180 μg) and leptin receptor activation measured as the pSTAT3/
STAT3 ratio. Triolein completely blocked the ability of leptin to
activate its receptor (Figure 2b; ANOVA: F(2,14) = 6.67, Po0.01),
demonstrating that it can induce leptin resistance. Similarly,
triolein blocked the ability of insulin to stimulate its receptor
(Figure 2c; ANOVA: F(4,32) = 7.4, Po0.001; 2D ANOVA F(2,25) = 5.4,
Po0.05).
We then determined whether triolein affected leptin binding in
various brain regions. Triolein increased the uptake of I-Lep by
whole brain, striatum, hypothalamus, occipital cortex, cerebellum,
and midbrain. Levels of I-Lep were not affected by triolein
administration in olfactory bulb, frontal cortex, parietal cortex,
hippocampus, thalamus, pons-medulla or serum (Figure 3).
The behavioral consequences of triglyceride-induced leptin
resistance were assessed by measuring two endpoints of leptin
action within the CNS: inhibition of feeding and cognition. To
assess feeding, 500 ng per mouse of leptin was injected into the
lateral ventricle of the brain with or without 180 μg of triolein and
food
intake
measured
for
24 h
(n = 25,
26,
27/per
group,
respectively). In comparison to mice given an injection of vehicle,
those injected with leptin ate less food as measured at 0–24 and
4–24 h, whereas those who were given leptin+triolein ate slightly
more (Figure 4a; ANOVA: F(2,75) = 4.43, Po0.05; Figure 4b ANOVA:
F(2,75) = 4.80, Po0.05); there were no statistically significant
differences among the groups at 0–4 h (data not shown). Learning
and memory were tested in a T maze avoidance task in mice
treated with or without gemfibrozil. The drug lowered serum
triglyceride levels by 46% and the measures of both acquisition
(learning) and retention (memory) correlated inversely with blood
triglyceride levels (Figure 5a: r = 0.703, n = 18, Po0.01); Figure 5b:
r = 0.733, n = 18, Po0.001). Gemfibrozil had no significant effect
on brain or body weight.
To determine whether peripheral triglycerides can cross the BBB
in amounts sufficient to induce leptin resistance, we gave mice a
total of 3 ml of whole milk IP over a 2 h period and then measured
the ability of ICV leptin to activate the hypothalamic leptin
receptor as measured by STAT phosphorylation (n = 8–10 per
group). We used nonfat milk as the control as it has a very similar
composition to whole milk excepting the absence of fat, of which
98% is in the form of triglycerides.27 We found that the percent
phosphorylation of STAT by the leptin receptor was decreased by
about 1/3 in mice treated with IP whole milk in comparison to
those treated with IP nonfat milk (Figures 5a and b; ANOVA:
F(3,33) = 19.5, Po0.001). We estimated the amount of the IP dose

 of triglycerides entering the brain and blood by including
radioactive triolein in the IP injection of some animals. We found
that about 1.3%, 1.1% and 4.1% of the administered dose was
taken up per g of the hypothalamus, hippocampus, and whole
brain, respectively (Figure 6c). About 12.8% was found per
milliliter of serum. As about 3.5% of whole milk is triglycerides,
this would suggest that about 1.25 mg of triglycerides were taken
up per gram of hypothalamus.
DISCUSSION
Triglycerides have been shown to induce peripheral leptin
resistance.20 This raised the question of whether triglycerides
could also induce central resistance to leptin or to insulin, two
proteins noted for their centrally mediated effects on body weight
and cognition. To induce central resistance, triglycerides would
have to cross the BBB. However, we could find no studies
assessing whether triglycerides could cross the BBB and very
limited data on whether triglycerides were even present in the
CSF.25 As such, we first determined whether triglycerides were
detectable in human CSF. We found that triglycerides were
present at about 0.65 mg dl − 1, a level representing about 0.6% of
blood levels.

Triglycerides, BBB, leptin and insulin

 We then assessed whether triglycerides could cross the BBB by
injecting radioactive triolein into the jugular vein of anesthetized
CD-1 male mice. Triglycerides rapidly appeared in brain with
accumulation over time. To reach the observed level of nearly
100 μl g − 1 at 20 min, the influx rate would have to be about
5 μl g − 1 min − 1, a rate associated with BBB transport for regulatory
proteins.3,28
We next determined whether triglycerides in the brain could
induce leptin or insulin resistance at their CNS receptors. We first
performed a dose–response curve to determine the amount of
leptin needed to activate the leptin receptor at the hypothalamus.
We chose 100 ng of leptin as a dose for further study as it partially
activated the receptor. We found that triglycerides blocked the
ability of leptin or insulin to activate their canonical signaling
pathways. Because of the different structures of triglycerides and
proteins, it is unlikely that triolein induces receptor resistance by
competitively blocking the binding of a protein to its receptor. To
begin to assess how a triglyceride might act to inhibit receptor
activation, we injected radioactive leptin ICV with or without
triolein and assessed leptin binding throughout the brain. Triolein
altered leptin binding in whole brain and in five of the eleven
brain
regions
assessed.
However,
leptin
binding
was
not
decreased, but increased, by triglycerides. This is not consistent
with a competitive mechanism for inhibiting receptor activation
but suggestive of an allosteric or post-receptor mechanism.
The consequences of triglyceride-induced receptor resistance
were assessed by measuring two endpoints of leptin action within
the CNS: inhibition of feeding and cognition. Administering leptin
ICV decreases feeding and so we here assessed the effect of
triolein on the anorexia induced by ICV-administered leptin. We
found that leptin induced significant anorexia during the 24 h
after its ICV administration. Triglycerides effectively inhibited the
leptin-induced anorexia. Previous work has shown that injecting
triglycerides
directly
into
the
brain
impairs
learning
and
memory.23 Here we assessed the effect of serum triglycerides on
learning and memory by decreasing serum triglycerides with the
drug gemfibrozil. This drug lowers serum triglyceride levels
without affecting cholesterol levels and is used clinically to treat
severe hyperlipidemia. We found that lowering serum triglycerides
not only improved cognition, but that cognition was inversely
related to serum levels of triglycerides.
Finally, we gave triglycerides peripherally in the form of whole
milk. As we gave 3 ml of whole milk, which in the US is 3.25–-3.5%
fat, we estimate we gave an IP dose of about 100 mg of
triglycerides. We found that ICV leptin produced an increase in
phophorylated STAT that was about 1/3 less in mice treated with
whole milk as compared to those treated with no fat milk. By
including radioactive triolein in a set of mice that had received the
same
regimen
of
whole
milk
as
those
studied
for
STAT
phosphorylation, we could estimate how much of the IP
triglycerides could have entered the brain. For hypothalamus,
this value was about 1.3% of the IP dose per gram of brain tissue,
which calculates to a little over 1 mg of triglycerides taken up per
gram of brain tissue. However, unlike the formal measure of BBB
permeability (Figure 1b), we did not determine the percent of the
radioactivity that represented intact triglycerides. Since in this
experiment the triglycerides would have been exposed to the
peritoneum and circulated for hours and not minutes, it may be
that some of this material represented breakdown product.
Triglyceride-induced leptin resistance would convey an evolu-
tionary advantage during the early starvation phase by reducing
anorexia and caloric expenditure. Serum leptin levels are typically
reduced to 10–40% of baseline levels with starvation, with the
amount of reduction being influenced by length of starvation and
serum levels of insulin and glucose.29–32 It may be that reversal of
leptin’s actions during starvation is so advantageous to reproduc-
tive success that three levels of such inhibition have been
conserved: impaired secretion by adipose tissue, inhibition of
transport across the blood–brain barrier, inhibition of receptor
function.
The above findings provide an additional mechanism by which
the metabolic syndrome can contribute to cognitive difficulties
and how it can ‘feed forward’ towards the obesity phenotype. The
work
also
suggests
that
a
significant
lowering
of
serum
triglyceride levels could reverse the cognitive impairments and
help with weight loss, although these and our previous studies
suggest that triglycerides will likely have to be lowered to below
100 mg dl − 1.
In conclusion, we showed that triglycerides cross the BBB and
induce central receptor resistance to leptin and insulin, with
resulting effects on feeding and cognition. These results suggest
that targeting triglyceride levels in blood could be a strategy for
treating obesity and the cognitive problems associated with CNS
resistance to leptin and insulin.
