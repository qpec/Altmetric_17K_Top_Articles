Mayaro virus has been associated with small outbreaks in 
northern South America. We isolated this virus from a child 
with acute febrile illness in rural Haiti, confirming its role as 
a cause of mosquitoborne illness in the Caribbean region. 
The clinical presentation can mimic that of chikungunya, 
dengue, and Zika virus infections.
M
ayaro virus (MAYV; genus Alphavirus, family Toga-
viridae) is a single-stranded positive RNA virus that 
was first isolated in Trinidad in 1954 (1) and is one of the 
viruses that comprise the Semliki Forest virus complex (2). 
Its transmission cycle is thought to occur mainly through 
mosquito vectors, especially those of genus Haemagogus 
(3), but Aedes spp. mosquitoes may also be competent 
vectors (4,5). The natural reservoirs of MAYV have been 
reported to be sylvatic vertebrates, mainly nonhuman pri-
mates but also birds and reptiles (3).
Since May 2014, when chikungunya virus (CHIKV) 
swept across the island of Hispaniola, researchers at the 
University of Florida (Gainesville, FL, USA) have studied 
alphavirus and flavivirus transmission in Haiti in collabo-
ration with the Christianville Foundation. This foundation 
operates 4 schools in the Gressier/Leogane region of Haiti 
(≈20 miles west of Port-au-Prince) that serve ≈1,250 stu-
dents from prekindergarten to grade 12 (6). The Univer-
sity of Florida has protocols in place for the collection of 
diagnostic blood samples from children seen at the school 
clinic with acute undifferentiated febrile illness (i.e., febrile 
illness with no localizing signs, such as would be expected 
with pneumonia, urinary tract infections, etc.).
From May 2014 through February 2015, blood sam-
ples were obtained from 177 children who met the crite-
ria for acute undifferentiated febrile illness. The protocol 
for sample collection was approved by the University of 
Florida Institutional Review Board and the Haitian Nation-
al Institutional Review Board. Written parental informed 
consent was obtained from parents or guardians of all study 
participants. Plasma samples were screened by reverse 
transcription PCR (RT-PCR) for CHIKV and dengue vi-
rus (DENV); samples that were negative for CHIKV were 
cultured by using cell lines and conditions as previously 
described (7). Zika virus and enterovirus D68 have been 
previously isolated from members of this school cohort 
(7,8). We report detection of MAYV in a child as part of 
this screening process.
The Case
On January 8, 2015, an 8-year-old boy was examined at 
the school clinic because of fever and abdominal pain. His 
temperature was 100.4°F, lung sounds were clear, and his 
abdomen was soft and not tender. He had no rash and no 
conjunctivitis. On the basis of this clinical presentation, the 
clinic physician empirically diagnosed typhoid and admin-
istered co-trimoxazole.
A blood sample was collected, and RNA was extracted 
from plasma by using RT-PCR primers and the procedure 
described by Santiago et al. (9). The sample was negative 
for CHIKV but positive for DENV-1 (cycle threshold 26). 
In Vero E6 cells, which had been inoculated with the speci-
men, diffuse cytopathic effects typical for DENV-1 devel-
oped but at a much later time than for DENV-1–positive 
plasma specimens from other patients; this finding raised 
the possibility that DENV-1 had either mutated to reduced 
replication fitness or that the cells were co-infected with >2 
incompatible viruses that were interfering with the replica-
tion of each other. DENV-1 viral RNA was detected by 
RT-PCR in the spent cell media of the plasma-inoculated 
cells but not in the spent media from noninoculated cells 
(negative control; online Technical Appendix, http://ww-
wnc.cdc.gov/EID/article/22/11/16-1015-Techapp1.pdf). 
Furthermore, no CHIKV- or Zika virus–specific amplicons 
were amplified from the spent media. However, apart from 
DENV-1, an alphavirus amplicon corresponding in size to 
that expected for MAYV was detected in viral RNA ex-
tracted from infected Vero cells. Sequencing confirmed 
that the amplicon corresponded to MAYV (GenBank ac-
cession no. KX496990).
The MAYV genome from Haiti was aligned with all 
MAYV strains available in GenBank, and a neighbor-joining

tree was inferred from pairwise genetic distances estimated 
with the best fitting nucleotide substitution model (general 
time reversible plus gamma), as previously described (7). 
The phylogeny clearly shows 2 major and well-supported 
(bootstrap >90%) clades (Figure). The first clade includes 
strains sampled over the past 60 years from several South 
American countries (Peru, Bolivia, Venezuela, Trinidad and 
Tobago, and French Guiana); the second clade clusters the 
new Haiti strain with isolates from Brazil sampled during 
1955–2014.
Conclusions
Although MAYV was originally isolated in Trinidad in 
1954, subsequent reports of illness associated with this vi-
rus have tended to be associated with small, occasional out-
breaks (30–100 cases) in northern South America (10,11), 
within and close to the Amazon forest. Signs and symptoms 
reported in association with MAYV infection include ar-
thralgias, eye pain, fever, headache, myalgias, rash, and oc-
casionally nausea and vomiting, photophobia, abdominal 
pain, cough, diarrhea, sore throat, and bleeding gums (12). 
A fatal infection associated with hemorrhagic fever has been 
reported (13). MAYV infections are probably underdiag-
nosed because of confusion with other mosquitoborne virus 
infections, especially dengue fever, which is endemic to the 
same areas. The emergence of CHIKV has further added to 
this confusion, especially because prolonged arthralgia is re-
portedly associated with CHIKV and MAYV infections (3).
Our findings suggest that MAYV is actively circulat-
ing in the Caribbean region and that there may be a link 
between the strain circulating in Haiti and the strains that 
have been circulating in Brazil since isolation of the virus 
in the 1950s. The patient from whom we isolated the organ-
ism had fever and abdominal pain but no rash or arthral-
gia. However, given that the patient was co-infected with 
DENV-1, it is difficult to separate out symptoms that are 
specific for MAYV infection. Of note, the clinic physician 
empirically diagnosed typhoid and treated the patient ac-
cordingly. The patient was from a rural/semi-rural area of 
Haiti, reflecting an ecologic setting that differs greatly from 
sylvan Amazon regions where many of the other reported 
MAYV infections have occurred. Little is known about 
vectors for MAYV in Haiti; potential animal reservoirs, if 
any, remain to be identified.
The recent emergence of Zika virus infection in the 
Caribbean region, and its identification as a major cause 
of birth defects, has brought a great deal of attention to 
arboviruses. Our findings highlight the multiplicity of ar-
bovirus species in Haiti and the evolutionary relatedness 
among the viruses in Haiti and those circulating in Bra-
zil, in keeping with prior work on Zika virus (7). Find-
ings also underscore the complexity of the interactions 
among different species and the apparent proclivity for 
Zika virus/DENV (7) and MAYV/DENV co-infections. 
Although a better understanding of Zika virus infection 
is clearly needed, careful studies of other arboviruses

(and their vectors and possible reservoirs) in these same 
geographic regions are correspondingly needed. We do 
not know if MAYV has epidemic potential; however, in 
light of recent observations with CHIKV, DENV, and 
Zika virus and the potential for transmission of MAYV 
by Aedes and Haemagogus spp. mosquitoes, inclusion 
of MAYV in studies of arbovirus transmission seems to 
be indicated.
This study was conducted with use of internal funds from the 
Emerging Pathogens Institute, University of Florida.
