Abstract
Importance—More than 80% of patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction 
(HFPEF), the most common form of HF among older persons, are overweight/obese. Exercise 
intolerance is the primary symptom of chronic HFPEF and a major determinant of reduced 
quality-of-life (QOL).
Objective—To determine whether caloric restriction (Diet), or aerobic exercise training 
(Exercise), improves exercise capacity and QOL in obese older HFPEF patients.
Design—Randomized, attention-controlled, 2x2 factorial trial conducted from February 2009 
November 2014.
Setting—Urban academic medical center.
Participants—100 older (67±5 years) obese (BMI=39.3±5.6kg/m2) women (n=81) and men 
(n=19) with chronic, stable HFPEF enrolled from 577 patients initially screened (366 excluded by 
inclusion / exclusion criteria, 31 for other reasons, 80 declined participation). Twenty-six 
participants were randomized to Exercise alone, 24 to Diet alone, 25 to Diet+Exercise, and 25 to 
Control; 92 completed the trial.
Interventions—20 weeks of Diet and/or Exercise; Attention Control consisted of telephone calls 
every 2 weeks.
Main Outcomes and Measures—Exercise capacity measured as peak oxygen consumption 
(VO2, ml/kg/min; primary outcome) and QOL measured by the Minnesota Living with HF 
Questionnaire (MLHF) total score (co-primary outcome; score range: 0–105, higher scores 
indicate worse HF-related QOL).
Results—By main effects analysis, peak VO2 was increased significantly by both interventions: 
Exercise main effect 1.2 ml/kg/min (95%CI: 0.7,1.7; p<0.001); Diet main effect 1.3 ml/kg/min 
(95%CI: 0.8,1.8; p<0.001). The combination of Exercise+Diet was additive (complementary) for 
peak VO2 (joint effect 2.5 ml/kg/min). The change in MLHF total score was non-significant with 
Exercise (main effect −1 unit; 95%CI: −8,5; p=0.70) and with Diet (main effect −6 units; 95%CI: 
−12,1; p=0.078). The change in peak VO2 was positively correlated with the change in percent 
lean body mass (r=0.32; p=0.003) and the change in thigh muscle/intermuscular fat ratio (r=0.27; 
p=0.02). There were no study-related serious adverse events. Exercise attendance was 84±14%; 
Diet compliance was 99±1%. Body weight decreased by 7±1 kg (7%) in Diet, 4±1 kg (3%) in 
Exercise, 11±1 kg (10%) in Exercise+Diet, and 1±1 kg (1%) in Control.

 Conclusion and Relevance—Among obese older patients with clinically stable heart failure 
and preserved ejection fraction, caloric restriction diet or aerobic exercise training increased peak 
oxygen consumption, and the effects may be additive. Neither intervention had a significant effect 
on quality of life as measured by the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire,

INTRODUCTION
Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFPEF) is the fastest growing form of HF, 
occurs primarily in older women, and is associated with high rates of morbidity, mortality, 
and health care expenditures.1 However, its pathophysiology is poorly understood, and 
medication trials to date have been neutral.
Most previous HFPEF trials focused on mediating the long-term consequences of 
hypertension. However, obesity is also an independent risk factor for development of HF2, 3 
and >80% of HFPEF patients are overweight or obese.4, 5 Increased adiposity promotes 
inflammation, hypertension, insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia and impairs cardiac, 
arterial, skeletal muscle, and physical function,6–8 all of which are common in HFPEF and 
contribute to its pathophysiology.9 It was recently shown that the severity of exercise 
intolerance, the primary symptom and major contributor to reduced quality of life (QOL) in 
patients with chronic HFPEF, is significantly correlated with increased body adiposity and 
skeletal muscle adipose infiltration.6, 10
In obese older individuals without HF, weight loss via dietary caloric restriction (Diet) 
improves left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy and diastolic function, exercise capacity, 
glucose, lipid, and blood pressure control, inflammation markers, body composition, and 
skeletal muscle function.8, 11–13 However, Diet is controversial in HF patients; observational 
studies suggest overweight or mildly-to-moderately obese HF patients (including HFPEF 
specifically) survive longer than those who are normal- or under-weight.5 There have been 
no studies of Diet in any type of HF and current HFPEF management guidelines do not 
include Diet.14
The objective of this study was to conduct a randomized, single-blind, attention controlled 
trial to examine the effects of Diet, alone and combined with aerobic exercise training 
(Exercise), on exercise capacity measured as peak exercise oxygen consumption (VO2, 
primary outcome) and QOL (co-primary outcome), and exploratory outcomes of body 
composition, leg muscle function, cardiac function, and inflammation in obese older HFPEF 
patients.

 METHODS
Study Overview
The trial was conducted at Wake Forest School of Medicine from February 2009 through 
November 2014, approved by the Institutional Review Board, and registered 
(NCT00959660). Participants provided written informed consent.
Participants
Participants were identified from search lists of medical records.15, 16 Inclusion criteria 
were: age ≥ 60 years; body mass index (BMI) ≥30kg/m2; symptoms and signs of HF defined 
by NHANES HF score ≥317 and/or the criteria of Rich et al.;18 LV ejection fraction ≥50%. 
Major exclusion criteria were: LV segmental wall motion abnormalities; significant 
ischemic or valvular heart disease, pulmonary disease, anemia, or other disorder that could 
explain the patients’ HF symptoms. Participants were clinically stable, had no significant 
change in cardiac medications for 4 weeks, and were not undergoing regular Exercise or 
Diet.
Outcomes
Primary Outcomes—Cardiopulmonary exercise testing was performed on a motorized 
treadmill using the modified Naughton protocol to the endpoint of exhaustion.19 Gas 
exchange was measured continuously during exercise (Medgraphics Ultima, St. Paul, 
Minnesota). Peak VO2 (ml/kg body mass/min), the co-primary outcome, was the average of 
measures from the last 30 seconds during peak exercise.19
The other co-primary outcome was disease-specific QOL assessed as the total score from the 
Minnesota Living with Heart Failure (MLHF) questionnaire.16,17,20 The MLHF score range 
is 0–105, higher scores indicate worse HF-related QOL.
Exploratory Outcomes—Exercise time, 6-minute walk distance (6MWD), ventilatory 
anaerobic threshold (VAT), and ventilation/carbon dioxide (Ve/VCO2) slope were assessed 
as previously described.15, 19
Total body lean mass and fat mass were measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry 
(DXA, Hologic Delphi QDR, Bedford MA) according to standardized protocols.10 Thigh 
muscle and fat areas and abdominal, epicardial and pericardial fat areas were measured 
using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI, General Electric Medical Systems, Milwaukee, 
Wisconsin), and an image analysis workstation (Tomovision, Montreal, Quebec).6
Leg press power (Watts) was assessed using the Nottingham power rig. Muscle quality was 
calculated as leg power/thigh muscle area (Watts/cm2) from MRI.
HF disease-specific QOL was assessed with the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire 
(KCCQ; range 0–100; higher scores indicate better QOL) and general QOL was assessed 
with the Medical Outcomes 36-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36; range 0–100, 
average is 50; higher scores indicate better QOL).15, 16, 21, 22

 Doppler-echocardiograms were performed and analyzed per American Society of 
Echocardiography recommendations.16 Doppler LV filling patterns and pulse-wave velocity 
were assessed as described.16
LV mass and volumes were assessed by cardiac MRI from multi-slice, multi-phase gradient-
echo sequences, traced manually, and calculated by summation.
Blood was collected after overnight fasting and stored at 80°C. B-type natriuretic peptide 
(BNP) was measured by radioimmunoassay (Phoenix Pharmaceuticals; Mountain View, 
Calif).15, 23 High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and plasma interleukin-6 (IL-6) 
were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays; please see online supplement for 
details.
Blinding of Outcomes Assessments
The PI and all study investigators, except the biostatistician investigator were blinded to all 
study outcomes. Personnel performing the outcome measures were blinded to participant 
group. For practical considerations, an exception was for cardiopulmonary exercise testing 
where the supervising physician and staff were blinded to the baseline (pre-randomization) 
results. To minimize bias, standardized procedures known to elicit maximal exercise 
performance were used, including a standardized protocol, guidance by the respiratory 
exchange ratio (RER, an objective indicator of effort) and Borg scale, and reading of a 
standardized participant instruction script prior to each exercise test.
Randomization
After baseline assessments were completed, participants were randomized using a computer-
generated list (SAS) maintained by the study statistician and stratified by beta-blocker 
medication and gender to one of four groups consisting of Exercise only, Diet only, 
combined Exercise and Diet (Exercise+Diet), or attention control (Control). No blocking 
across time was used.
Interventions
Participants randomized to either group receiving Exercise completed 1-hour supervised 
exercise sessions 3 times per week for 20-weeks consisting primarily of walking exercise 
using an individualized exercise prescription based on the exercise test results, and intensity 
level was progressed as tolerated and based primarily on heart rate reserve.15, 16
Participants randomized to either group receiving Diet were prescribed a hypocaloric diet 
using meals (lunch, dinner, snacks) prepared by the Wake Forest Clinical Research 
Metabolic Kitchen under direction of a registered dietician (RD). Participants prepared their 
own breakfast from a menu. Individual energy needs were calculated from resting metabolic 
rate (MedGraphics CCM) following an overnight fast and an activity factor based on self-
reported daily activity. Prescribed calorie intake deficits were ~400 kcal/day for the Diet 
only group and ~350 kcal/day for the Exercise+Diet group (the difference between the 
groups allowed for the energy expenditure of the Exercise intervention), but not <1000 kcal/
day. The diet provided ~1.2g protein/kg ideal body weight, 25–30% fat calories and the

 remainder as carbohydrate. Participants were provided daily calcium supplements (600 mg) 
and kept records of all food consumed which was monitored weekly.
Participants randomized to attention control (Control) received neither diet or exercise 
interventions and were requested and voluntarily agreed to not make diet or exercise 
changes during the 20-week study. They received telephone calls every 2 weeks from staff 
in an attempt to match that received by participants in the Diet and Exercise groups.
Statistical Analysis
All analyses were performed with SAS version 9.0. The study was a 2x2 factorial design to 
estimate the main effect of the two interventions, Exercise and Diet, and the primary and 
exploratory outcomes were tested at the 5% two-sided level of significance. The trial was 
designed to have two co-primary outcomes, the performance measure peak VO2 (ml/kg/min) 
and the MLHF questionnaire total score. All available outcome data were analyzed in an 
intention to treat analysis. The analysis testing the main effects of Diet and Exercise and 
their interaction was performed using analysis of covariance with the baseline measure of 
the outcome measure, gender, and beta blocker usage as covariates. This method adjusts for 
differences in the means of the baseline measure of the outcome and other predictor 
covariates to estimate what the mean in each level of the factor would be had both groups 
had the same overall mean of the covariates in the model. This method is equivalent to 
multiple imputation of missing data with the covariates as predictors and infinite iterations. 
We also performed sensitivity analyses to assess the impact of missing data. The least square 
means (LSMEAN) is presented along with either its standard error (SE) or 95% confidence 
intervals (CI). The main effect of each intervention, which is the difference in the 
LSMEANS between the two-levels of each of the factors (Exercise, Diet) is presented along 
with its 95% confidence interval and a p-value. Based on a previous study of HF patients, 
sample size calculations indicated that 80 evaluable participants would provide ≥80% power 
to detect a main effect of 6% in peak VO2 and effect size of 20% on MLHF total score. 
Allowing for up to 20% loss to follow-up, 100 participants were randomized to the four 
groups. Because the test for interaction between the two factors, which is a linear contrast 
between the four individual group means, has low power, the two interventions were only 
considered additive (complementary) if the p-value for intervention was ≥0.10.
Baseline participant characteristics are presented as mean and standard deviation or 
frequency and percent. Associations between changes in exercise capacity and other 
variables were made by Pearson correlations.
See the online supplemental text for additional details on sample size, effect size, testing for 
interaction, multiple comparisons, multiple stepwise regression, and missing data.
RESULTS
Participants
From 1,586 records reviewed, 577 patients were further screened by telephone; 167 were 
scheduled for a screening visit. Ultimately, 100 HFPEF patients (age 67±5 years) were 
enrolled and randomized: 26 Exercise, 24 Diet, 25 Exercise+Diet, 25 Control (Figure 1).

 Ninety-two participants (24 Exercise, 24 Diet, 22 Exercise+Diet, 22 Control) completed the 
intervention and follow-up testing (Figure 1). Participant characteristics were generally in 
accord with those observed in population studies, with predominantly women and high rates 
of hypertension, diabetes, LV hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction (Table 1).
Primary Outcomes
Both Diet and Exercise significantly increased exercise capacity as determined by the co-
primary outcome, peak VO2 (Diet main effect 1.3 (0.8,1.8) ml/kg body mass/min, p<0.0001; 
Exercise main effect 1.2 (0.7,1.7) ml/kg body mass/min, p<0.0001). The change in the co-
primary measure of QOL as measured by the MLHF total score was non-significant with 
Exercise (main effect −1 (−8,5) units, p=0.70) and with Diet (main effect −0.6 (−12,1) units, 
p=0.078) (Table 2).
Exploratory Measures
Exercise Performance—Both Diet and Exercise significantly increased multiple other 
measures of exercise capacity as determined by peak VO2 expressed in ml/kg lean body 
mass/min (Exercise main effect: 2.1 (1.0,3.1) ml/kglean/min, p= 0.0002; Diet main effect: 
1.36 (0.2,2.3), p=0.026), and ml/kg lean leg mass/min by DXA (Exercise main effect: 6.2 
(2.7,9.7) ml/kgleglean/min, p= 0.0008; Diet main effect: 4.5 (0.9,8.0), p=0.014), and ml/cm2 
thigh muscle area/min by MRI (Exercise main effect: 1.1 (0.7,1.5) ml/cm2muscle/min, 
p<0.0001; Diet main effect: 0.6 (0.2,1.1), p=0.002) as well as VO2 reserve (peak minus rest, 
ml/min (Exercise main effect: 97 (44,141) ml/min, p= 0.0005; Diet main effect: 59 (6,113), 
p=0.30), exercise time to exhaustion (Exercise main effect: 2.0 (1.4,2.6) min, p<0.0001; Diet 
main effect: 1.6 (1.0,2.2), p<0.0001), peak workload (METS; Exercise main effect: 0.8 
(0.4,1.1) METS, p<0.0001; Diet main effect: 0.7 (0.4,1.1) p<0.0001), and 6MWD (Exercise 
main effect:106 (60,152) feet, p<0.0001; Diet main effect: 85 (39,132), p=0.0005) (Table 2). 
Mean peak RER values were >1.10 for all groups at baseline and follow-up, suggesting 
exhaustive effort. There was an Exercise by Diet super-additive (synergistic) interaction for 
6MWD (p=0.09). There were no other significant Exercise by Diet interactions (Table 2), 
suggesting the interventions were additive (complementary) for other variables. With Diet, 
muscle quality significantly improved (main effect 0.15 (0.03,0.27) w/cm2) and leg press 
power showed non-significant change (main effect 11 (−2,23) watts, p=0.089) (Table 2).
Measures of QOL—Diet but not Exercise significantly improved the KCCQ score, a HF-
specific QOL measure, by 7 (2.6,12.3) units (p=0.004), substantially greater than the 
accepted threshold (5 units) for clinical relevance.21 Diet also significantly improved the 
general QOL SF-36 physical component score (Diet main effect 4 (1,7) units, p=0.015) 
(Table 2). There were no significant Exercise by Diet interactions.
Weight and Body Composition—Body weight was significantly decreased by both Diet 
and Exercise (Table 3; Supplementary eFigure 2) (Exercise main effect: −3 (−5, −1) kg, 
p<0.0001; Diet main effect: −7 (−9, −5), p<0.0001). With Diet the DXA measures of lean 
body mass (main effect: −2 (−3, −1) kg, p<0.0001), fat mass (main effect: −5 (−6, −4) kg, 
p<0.0001), and percent fat mass (main effect: −2 (−3, −1) percent, p<0.0001) were 
significantly decreased while percent lean body mass was significantly increased (main

 effect 2 (1,3) percent, p<0.0001); in contrast with Exercise only fat mass was decreased 
(main effect: −2 (−3, −1) kg, p=0.001) (Table 3). With Diet, MRI measures of thigh 
subcutaneous fat (main effect: −16 (−22, −10) cm2, p<0.0001), thigh muscle (main effect: 
−6 (−9, −3) cm2, p<0.0001), abdominal subcutaneous fat (main effect: −5 (−20,11) cm2, 
p<0.0001), and visceral fat were significantly decreased (main effect: −31 (−43, −19) cm2, 
p<0.0001) (Table 3); there were no significant changes with Exercise. There was no change 
in pericardial or epicardial fat. There were no significant Exercise by Diet interactions. 
(Table 3).
Cardiovascular Function—With Diet, LV mass by MRI (main effect: −4 (−7,0) g, 
p=0.034) and LV relative wall thickness by echocardiography (main effect: −0.03 (−0.05, 
−0.01), p=0.005) were significantly decreased and mitral E/A velocity ratio (main effect: 
0.10 (0.02,0.17), p=0.014) was significantly increased (Table 3). No other cardiac MRI or 
echo-Doppler measure was significantly changed (Table 3; Supplemental eTable 3). Arterial 
pulse-wave velocity was unchanged by either Diet or Exercise (Table 3).
Symptoms—With both Diet and Exercise, NYHA symptom class significantly improved 
(Exercise main effect: −0.4 (−0.6, −0.2) class, p<0.0001; Diet main effect: −0.4 (−0.5, −0.2) 
class, p=0.0001) (Table 2).
Inflammation and Lipids—With Diet but not Exercise, CRP was significantly reduced 
(Diet main effect: −2.8 (−4.9, −0.7) μg/L, p=0.023; Exercise main effect: −0.4 (−2.5,1.6), 
p=0.44); changes in IL-6 were non-significant (Diet main effect: −0.8 pg/ml (−1.5, −0.1), 
p=0.086; Exercise main effect: 0.4 (−0.3,1.1), p=0.51); there was no interaction (see also 
Supplementary eTable 4). The reduction in CRP correlated with the reduction in weight 
(r=0.29; p=0.005). With Diet but not Exercise, there were significant reductions in total 
cholesterol (Diet main effect: −14 (−24, −14) mg/dl, p=0.008; Exercise main effect: −4 
(−14,6), p=0.40) and LDL cholesterol (Diet main effect: −13 (−21, −4) mg/dL, p=0.008; 
Exercise main effect: −4 (−12,4), p=0.35) (Supplementary eTable 4); these changes 
persisted after adjustment for lipid lowering medications.
Associations with Change in Exercise Capacity—In the overall groups combined, 
change in peak VO2 was inversely related to change in total mass and fat mass, and was 
positively related to change in percent lean body mass and thigh skeletal muscle/
intermuscular fat ratio (SM/IMF) (Supplementary eFigure 3); there were also correlations 
with change in LV mass (r=−0.27, p=0.02) and CRP (r=−0.21; p=0.047). Similar results 
were observed with exercise time as the exercise capacity variable. Multiple stepwise 
regression showed that gender and change in total mass were the only independent 
predictors of peak VO2 (see online Supplemental Statistical Analysis section).
Intervention Fidelity—Participants completing the Exercise interventions attended a 
median of 84±14% of the exercise sessions, and together progressed from an average 19±6 
minutes at a 2.8±0.4 metabolic equivalent (MET) level at week 1 to an average 49±10 
minutes at a 3.8±1.2 MET level at week 20 Further details regarding attendance and 
progression are in the online supplement.

 The average actual caloric intake deficit was 388±55 kcal/d for Diet-only participants and 
355±23 kcal/d for Exercise+Diet participants. Dietary compliance (actual vs. prescribed 
calorie level) from recorded food logs was 99±1% for both Diet groups.
Adverse Events—Five adverse events judged as possibly related to the intervention 
occurred among 5 participants: hypoglycemia between meals in 2 participants (Diet, and 
Exercise+Diet groups), ankle pain and swelling later diagnosed as partial tendon tear 
(Exercise+Diet), stress foot fracture (Exercise), and an episode of unusual shortness of 
breath during exercise (Exercise). Three participants had a total of 6 hospitalizations, all 
judged unrelated to study participation: 1 participant was hospitalized for pancreatitis 
(Exercise), 1 participant had 3 hospitalizations for HF exacerbation/dyspnea (Exercise
+Diet), and 1 participant had 2 hospitalizations for leg edema, pain, and erythema (Control). 
There were no deaths.
DISCUSSION
The major novel findings of this randomized controlled trial are that in older, obese patients 
with chronic, stable HFPEF intentional weight loss via caloric restriction Diet was feasible, 
appeared safe, and significantly improved the co-primary outcome of exercise capacity. The 
combination of Diet with Exercise, the only intervention previously shown to improve 
exercise capacity in HFPEF,15, 16, 24 produced a robust increase in exercise capacity. The 
co-primary outcome of QOL, as measured by the MLHF total score, did not show a 
significant change with either Exercise or Diet.
Diet significantly improved two other widely accepted, standardized measures of QOL, the 
KCCQ score (a HF-specific QOL instrument) and the SF-36 physical score (a general QOL 
instrument). The improvement in KCCQ score was greater than the accepted threshold for 
clinical relevance.21 The statistically significant, clinically meaningful improvement in 
KCCQ score with Diet occurred even though the change in MLHF total score did not 
achieve statistical significance. This suggests that the study may have been underpowered 
for the MLHF instrument and that the KCCQ instrument may be more sensitive to change in 
QOL in older HFPEF patients.
Diet also significantly improved body composition, leg muscle quality, lipid profile, and 
inflammation biomarkers. The improvement in exercise capacity was associated with 
improved body composition, particularly reduced total fat mass and thigh muscle/
intermuscular fat ratio, and with reduced inflammation and LV mass.
These results are credible since studies of Diet alone or in combination with Exercise in non-
HF clinical populations have shown similar overall findings.11, 12 In a randomized clinical 
trial with similar design and sample size of obese frail older adults, Diet, Exercise, and their 
combination significantly improved peak VO2 and other measures of physical function and 
the effects of Diet and Exercise were additive (complementary).11 Other studies also have 
shown significantly greater improvements in body composition with Diet than 
Exercise.11, 25 Our finding of more improvement in QOL measures with Diet than with 
Exercise is also credible based on prior Exercise-Diet studies in obese older persons11 and

 since Exercise has not consistently improved QOL in HFPEF.15, 16, 24 Further, preliminary 
reports have indicated that weight reduction via bariatric surgery can prevent the onset of 
HF, and can improve exercise capacity in patients with HF and reduced EF (HFREF).26, 27
As others have indicated, peak VO2 relative to body weight (ml/kg/min), the pre-planned co-
primary outcome, is the most relevant measure of exercise capacity during weight-bearing 
(treadmill) exercise.11,28 A true increase in exercise tolerance with Diet is further supported 
by: a) significant increases in 4 other measures that are relatively independent of body mass 
(VO2 reserve, exercise time to exhaustion, workload, 6MWD); b) preservation of absolute 
peak VO2 (ml/min); c) improvement in leg power that occurred despite significant loss of 
muscle mass. The largest increase in exercise capacity was with Exercise+Diet combined.
What are the potential mechanisms underlying improved exercise capacity? Increased 
adipose tissue mass promotes inflammation, hypertension, insulin resistance, and 
dyslipidemia resulting in impaired cardiac, arterial, and skeletal muscle function, all of 
which contribute to reduced exercise capacity in HFPEF patients9, 29–33 and can be reversed 
with Diet.6, 8, 9, 13, 34 Using DXA, we recently reported that percent body fat and percent leg 
fat were significantly increased while percent body lean and leg lean mass were reduced in 
older HFPEF patients versus controls and were related to reduced exercise capacity.10 Using 
MRI, we found that older HFPEF patients have increased thigh IMF, despite a normal 
amount of subcutaneous fat.6 Furthermore, the SM/IMF ratio was increased and both IMF 
area and SM/IMF ratio were independent predictors of peak VO2.6 IMF may compete with 
muscle tissue for critical blood flow during exercise reducing perfusive O2.35 IMF may also 
reduce diffusive O2 transport by increasing the distance O2 must traverse from the capillary 
to the muscle mitochondria. Furthermore, increased IMF may reduce skeletal muscle 
capillary density and mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative metabolism, all of which are 
abnormal in HFPEF.31, 33, 36 In our study, increased peak VO2 was associated with reduced 
fat mass, increased percent lean mass and thigh SM/IMF ratio, and reduced inflammation 
biomarkers. Thus, improvement in peak VO2 from Diet and Exercise may be due to reduced 
inflammation and enhanced mitochondrial function, attenuated reactive oxygen species 
generation, increased vascular oxidative stress resistance, increased nitric oxide 
bioavailability and improved microvascular function. Together, these may increase diffusive 
O2 transport and/or O2 utilization by the active muscles.37
With Diet, LV mass and relative wall thickness decreased and LV E/A ratio increased, but 
we observed no other improvements in resting cardiac function. We also observed no 
significant changes in epicardial or pericardial fat, in contrast to reduced adipose tissue 
elsewhere. Although we did not measure cardiac function during exercise, these data suggest 
that the improvements we observed with Diet and its combination with Exercise may be due 
primarily to favorable ‘non-cardiac’ peripheral adaptations, in accord with reports of 
Exercise in HFPEF.16, 32
Because of the reported ‘HF obesity paradox’ (lower mortality observed in overweight/
obese),5 before Diet can be recommended for obese HFPEF patients, further studies likely 
are needed to determine whether these favorable changes are associated with reduced 
clinical events. However, a recent meta-analysis of randomized trials in older patients

 without HF indicates that intentional weight loss from Diet is associated with a 15% 
reduction in total mortality.38
As observed in other Diet studies and despite adequate protein intake, there was a significant 
decrease in muscle mass with Diet that was not prevented by Exercise. Although the long-
term consequences of this are unclear, the muscle loss did not prevent increases in exercise 
capacity or leg power. Inclusion of strength training may have reduced loss of muscle mass 
during Diet.
Limitations
This was a randomized, clinical trial with frequent monitoring, professionally administered 
Diet, and medically supervised Exercise; safety and efficacy could differ under other 
conditions. The minimum BMI was 30 kg/m2 which includes most HFPEF patients.4, 5 
However, our data do not address safety and efficacy of Diet in patients with lower BMI.
Our patients had typical clinical features of HFPEF (including severe exercise intolerance, 
LV hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction, 76% on maintenance diuretics) and met pre-
determined criteria for HFPEF utilized in prior publications and recommended by the 
AHA/ACC14 and ESC. The relatively modest BNP levels likely result from: 1) non-
hospitalized, stable patients who were clinically well-compensated as required for 
exhaustive exercise testing and the 20-week intervention; 2) a strong, inverse relation that 
exists between BNP and BMI,39 such that when matched for other disease variables, BNP is 
much lower in obese than non-obese HFPEF patients, frequently <100pg/ml;39, 40 3) BNP 
levels are significantly lower in HFPEF than HFREF due to lower LV wall stress.23
Conclusions
Among obese older patients with clinically stable heart failure and preserved ejection 
fraction, caloric restriction diet or aerobic exercise training increased peak oxygen 
consumption, and the effects may be additive. Neither intervention had a significant effect 
on quality of life as measured by the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire.

comparison of least square means of the outcome measure following adjustment for baseline 
values, gender, and beta-blocker use. By factorial group, peak VO2 data are missing in 4 
cases: 2 in the Exercise group (due to gas leak and injury), 1 in the Diet group (due to 
injury), and 1 in the No Diet group (due to gas leak). By factorial group, MLHF data are 
missing in 4 cases: 2 in the Diet group, 1 in the Exercise group, and 1 in the No Exercise 
group all due to patient errors.
