ABSTRACT
Bone strength is influenced by bone geometry, density, and bone microarchitecture, which adapt to increased mechanical loads
during growth. Physical activity (PA) is essential for optimal bone strength accrual; however, less is known about how sedentary time
influences bone strength and its determinants. Thus, our aim was to investigate the prospective associations between PA, sedentary
time, and bone strength and its determinants during adolescence. We used HR-pQCT at distal tibia (8% site) and radius (7% site) in
173 girls and 136 boys (aged 9 to 20 years at baseline). We conducted a maximum of four annual measurements at the tibia (n ¼ 785
observations) and radius (n ¼ 582 observations). We assessed moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) and sedentary time with
accelerometers (ActiGraph GT1M). We aligned participants on maturity (years from age at peak height velocity) and fit a mixed-
effects model adjusting for maturity, sex, ethnicity, leg muscle power, lean mass, limb length, dietary calcium, and MVPA in sedentary
time models. MVPA was a positive independent predictor of bone strength (failure load [F.Load]) and bone volume fraction (BV/TV)
at the tibia and radius, total area (Tt.Ar) and cortical porosity (Ct.Po) at the tibia, and negative predictor of load-to-strength ratio at
the radius. Sedentary time was a negative independent predictor of Tt.Ar at both sites and Ct.Po at the tibia and a positive predictor
of cortical thickness (Ct.Th), trabecular thickness (Tb.Th), and cortical bone mineral density (Ct.BMD) at the tibia. Bone parameters
demonstrated maturity-specific associations with MVPA and sedentary time, whereby associations were strongest during early and
mid-puberty. Our findings support the importance of PA for bone strength accrual and its determinants across adolescent growth
and provide new evidence of a detrimental association of sedentary time with bone geometry but positive associations with
microarchitecture. This study highlights maturity-specific relationships of bone strength and its determinants with loading and
unloading. Future studies should evaluate the dose-response relationship and whether associations persist into adulthood. © 2017

Introduction
P
hysical activity (PA) and weight-bearing exercise are
essential to develop and maintain a healthy skeleton.(1,2)
In particular, there is strong evidence to suggest that the critical
period of pre- and early puberty may provide a “window of
opportunity” when skeletal benefits of weight-bearing PA can
be optimized.(3) In contrast, we know less about the mechanisms
underpinning bone’s adaptation to PA in later adolescence.(4)
This may be due, in part, to reliance on imaging systems such as
dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) because they may be
unable to capture subtle adaptations in bone strength and its
determinants, such as geometry, density, and microarchitecture.
In recent years, three-dimensional imaging tools, such as
peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT), have
provided new evidence to support the role of PA as an important
driver of bone strength and its determinants during growth. For
example, a cross-sectional study demonstrated a significant
positive association between accelerometry-derived vigorous
PA and cortical geometry, density, and estimated strength at the
mid-tibia (strength strain index [SSIp]; by pQCT) in adolescent
boys and girls (n ¼ 1748).(5) Total daily steps by pedometry were
associated with bone strength index (BSI) at the distal tibia
and femur in 8- to 13-year-old girls (n ¼ 349).(6) In addition, we
previously demonstrated a positive association at the distal
tibia between accelerometry-derived moderate-to-vigorous PA
(MVPA) and bone geometry and estimated bone strength
(failure load) assessed with high-resolution (HR)-pQCT and finite
element analysis in boys and trabecular and cortical micro-
architecture in girls (n ¼ 209).(7) In the only longitudinal study of

 PA that used pQCT to image bone, the Iowa Bone Development
Study used group-based trajectory modeling and demonstrated
that boys and girls (n ¼ 346) who engaged in the highest of
three levels of MVPA (by accelerometry) throughout growth had
significantly greater estimated bone strength at the distal and
33% site of the tibia (BSI and polar moment of inertia) at age
17 years compared with those in the lowest MVPA trajectory.(8)
Despite the numerous health benefits associated with PA,
today’s youth spend roughly 60% of their waking hours in
sedentary
activities.(9)
However,
whether
sedentary
time
independently influences health outcomes or simply displaces
other forms of PA is currently debatable.(10) A focus upon the
consequences of “not loading” a healthy growing skeleton
is relatively new, and only four DXA studies(11–14) and one
HR-pQCT study(7) investigated the relationship between objec-
tively measured sedentary time and bone in adolescents, with
contradictory findings.(15) A recent systematic review suggested
there was insufficient evidence to fully support an association
between sedentary time and bone health, independent of PA.(15)
Thus, it remains unclear how the potentially deleterious impact
of sedentary time interacts with the osteogenic effect of PA in
healthy, ambulatory children and adolescents. Prospective
studies would serve to clarify the structural and microarchitec-
tural adaptations associated with sedentary time during growth.
They would also ascertain whether sedentary time influences
bone development independent of PA.
Thus, our primary aim was to prospectively evaluate the
association between PA and growth-related adaptations in bone
strength and its determinants at the distal tibia and radius in
boys and girls. Our secondary aim was to prospectively evaluate
the association between sedentary time and growth-related
adaptations in bone strength and its determinants at the distal
tibia and radius in boys and girls, independent of PA. We
hypothesized that PA would positively predict adaptations in
bone strength and its determinants, whereas sedentary time
would not be related to bone strength and its determinants,
independent of PA.
Materials and Methods
Study design
Our study design and methods have been described in detail
previously.(7,16,17) Participants were drawn from a cohort of
healthy girls (n ¼ 556) and boys (n ¼ 515) aged 8 to 12 years at
study entry who comprised the University of British Columbia
Healthy Bones Study III (HBSIII) and are now part of the UBC
Pediatric Bone and Physical Activity Database. The HBSIII
cohort includes participants from three school-based studies
conducted from 1999 to 2012.(17–22)
Our analyses for this study included bone data from annual
measurements conducted between May 2008 (first year of
HR-pQCT tibia measurements) and June 2012. In the full cohort
with HR-pQCT data (n ¼ 399; Supplemental Fig. S1), we acquired
a median of 4 annual measurements at the distal tibia
(interquartile range: 3 to 4) and a median of 3 annual
measurements at the distal radius (interquartile range: 2 to 3).
For those participants with HR-pQCT and accelerometry data
(n ¼ 309; Supplemental Fig. S1), we acquired a maximum of 4
scans at the tibia and radius, with an average of 1.0 year between
measurements. We added HR-pQCT of the radius to our protocol
1 year after we first acquired HR-pQCT scans of the tibia. Thus,
we have a smaller sample of participants with HR-pQCT at the
distal radius (n ¼ 257) compared with the distal tibia (n ¼ 309).
For the purpose of this analysis, we refer to data obtained at the
first HR-pQCT measurement as baseline. We obtained written
informed consent from the parents or legal guardians, written
assent from participants younger than 18 years of age, and
informed consent from participants 18 years of age and older.
The University of British Columbia’s Clinical Research Ethics
Board approved the studies (H15-01194, H07-02013, H2-70537).
Anthropometry
We assessed standing and sitting height using standard stretch
stature techniques.(23) We recorded measurements to the
nearest millimeter using a wall-mounted stadiometer (Seca
Model 242, Hanover, MD, USA). We measured body mass to the
nearest 0.1 kg using a calibrated electronic scale (Seca Model
840) with participants dressed in light clothing. We assessed
limb length to the nearest 0.1 cm as the distance from the distal
edge of the medial malleolus to the tibial plateau for the tibia
and as the distance from the olecranon to the ulnar styloid
process for the ulna. Trained research assistants took all
measurements in duplicate, unless differences were >0.4 cm
or 0.2 kg, in which case they obtained a third measure. The
coefficients of variation in our lab for stature, tibia length, and
ulnar length are <0.3%, <3.5%, and <1%, respectively.
We determined total-body bone mineral free lean mass using
DXA (Hologic QDR 4500 W; Hologic, Inc, Waltham, MA, USA)
total-body scans. One trained technician acquired and analyzed
all scans using standard manufacturer protocols (Hologic, Inc).
Spine and anthropomorphic phantoms were scanned daily to
maintain quality assurance. One participant did not complete
DXA scans and was excluded from analyses. The coefficient of
variation in our lab for total-body lean mass is 0.3% (UBC Bone
Health Research Group, unpublished data).
Health history, ethnicity, and dietary calcium
We determined health history and ethnicity using a question-
naire, completed by parents at baseline and by participants at
subsequent annual visits. Based on questionnaire responses, we
identified 6 participants who had conditions that prevented
participation in regular physical activity and/or reported medical
conditions known to influence bone metabolism (osteogenesis
imperfecta, fetal alcohol syndrome, type 1 diabetes, leukemia,
congenital heart defect). Following these exclusions, our sample
included HR-pQCT data from 393 healthy participants (184 boys,
209 girls).
We determined each participant’s ethnicity based on their
parents’ response to questions regarding parents’ and/or
grandparents’ place of birth and their self-identified ethnicity.
We classified participants as “Asian” if both parents or three of
four grandparents were born in Hong Kong, China, Japan,
Taiwan, Philippines, Korea, or India; “white” if both parents or
three of four grandparents were born in North America
or Europe; and “other” if participant’s parents were of other or
mixed ethnicities. All participants completed a validated food
frequency questionnaire to estimate dietary intake of calcium
(mg/d).(24)
Maturity
To control for well-known maturational differences between
adolescent boys and girls of the same chronological age, we
estimated age at peak height velocity (APHV, years) as an

 estimate of biological maturity.(16,17,25) In brief, we fit an
interpolating cubic spline to each participant’s height velocity
data. The magnitude of PHV was identified as growth per year
(cm/yr) that occurred at APHV. Because of missing and mistimed
measurements surrounding APHV, we were only able to identify
APHV using the cubic spline method in 198 participants (50% of
cohort). For the remaining participants, we used the Moore
equation(25) and anthropometric data from the measurement
occasion closest to normative APHV (approximately 11.6 years in
girls and 13.5 years in boys(25)) to estimate APHV. Thus, we used
the measurement occasion when girls were closest to 11.6 years
(range 9.5 to 13.1 years) and boys were closest to 13.0 years (10.8
to 14.3 years), on average, to estimate APHV. For all participants,
we used APHV to calculate a continuous measure of biological
maturity offset (in years) by subtracting APHV from chronologi-
cal age at time of measurement (eg, �1 year is equivalent to
1 year before attainment of APHV; þ1 to 1 year after APHV). For
descriptive purposes, we also assessed maturity at each visit
using the method of Tanner; self-reported pubic hair stage in
boys and self-reported breast stage in girls.(26) On average, girls
attain APHV by Tanner stage 3 (early puberty) and boys by
Tanner stage 4 (peri-puberty).(27)
Physical activity and sedentary time
We estimated objectively measured PA and sedentary time
using ActiGraph GT1M accelerometers (ActiGraph, Pensacola,
FL, USA) with a 15-second epoch. We attached each accelerom-
eter to an elastic belt and instructed participants to wear the belt
around their waist with the accelerometer positioned at the iliac
crest. We asked participants to wear the device during all waking
hours for 7 consecutive days, except during water-based
activities (eg, swimming and showering). We analyzed all data
using KineSoft software (v3.3.75; KineSoft, Loughborough, UK).
We included participants who recorded at least 10 hours of data
on 3 or more days(28) and defined non-wear time as 60 minutes
of consecutive zero counts. Based on these criteria, we excluded
83 participants who did not meet accelerometry inclusion
criteria. We used a cutpoint of <100 cpm to classify sedentary
time(29) and the Evenson cutpoints(29,30) to determine PA
intensities: moderate �2296 cpm and vigorous �4012 cpm.
Thus, MVPA was defined using an accelerometer cutpoint
�2296 cpm. We used the residuals approach to control for
differences in accelerometer wear time between participants.(31)
Muscle power
Muscular contractions impose the largest physiological loads on
the skeleton.(32) Thus, we used the Leonardo Mechanograph
Ground Reaction Force Plate (GRFP; Novotec, Pforzheim,
Germany) to assess peak muscle power, the mechanics of
which are described in detail elsewhere.(33) All participants
performed a single two-legged countermovement vertical jump
on the GRFP with their hands held static at their waist and their
feet hip width apart. The research assistant explained the
jumping protocol to all participants in a standardized manner.
Participants were asked to perform the countermovement jump
after hearing a tone (from the computer). The research assistant
instructed each participant to initiate a downward movement
and then immediately jump up as high as possible using both
legs. Participants were instructed to land with both feet on the
platform (with each foot on the appropriate side of the middle
line) and to remain still until after hearing a second tone from
the computer signaling the end of the trial. Each participant
performed one practice jump and three trial jumps. We acquired
peak power relative to body mass during during liftoff phase
(Pmaxrel, W/kg) from the jump associated with the maximum
height for analysis.
We used peak leg muscle power to characterize overall
functional muscle power because we did not assess upper limb
muscle power in the current study. Bohannon and colleagues
observed a strong correlation between lower leg and upper limb
grip strength in adults (r ¼ 0.77–0.81), including a high Cronbach
alpha and a single dominant component using principal
components analysis.(34) Thus, their findings suggest that lower
leg strength and upper limb strength represent a single
construct and that either measure can be used to characterize
overall limb muscle strength.
Bone microarchitecture, geometry, BMD, and strength
We assessed bone strength and its determinants at the non-
dominant distal tibia and radius using HR-pQCT (XtremeCT;
Scanco Medical AG, Bruttisellen, Switzerland), unless there was a
previous fracture at the desired site, in which case the opposite
limb was scanned (n ¼ 18 observations at the tibia and n ¼ 26 at
the radius). In brief, we first performed a 2D scout view over
the joint line to define the anatomic reference line and used the
same anatomical reference line to assess the same relative site
each year. We acquired a 9.02-mm slice at the distal tibia (8%
site; proximal to the tibial end plate) and distal radius (7% site;
proximal to the medial edge of the distal radius).(35) The 8% and
7% site at the distal tibia and radius, respectively, ensured that
scans would not include the growth plate in most children and
that the same relative regions could be scanned at follow-up.(35)
We scanned all participants using manufacturer’s standard
protocol of 60 kVp effective energy, 900 KA, matrix size of
1536 � 1536, and 100-ms integration time to acquire 110 slices
at an 82-mm nominal isotropic resolution. The first three and last
three slices were excluded from the analysis per manufacturer’s
protocol. The effective dose equivalent for the scan is less than
3 mSv per measurement; measurement time was 2.8 minutes per
scan. We conducted daily quality-control procedures to assess
density fluctuation and weekly procedures to standardize
geometry using a calibration phantom provided by the
manufacturer.
A single qualified technician evaluated all HR-pQCT scans for
motion artifacts and analyzed all scans per manufacturer’s
standard protocol.(36,37) We excluded 1 tibia scan and 33 radius
scans (3%) because of motion artifact >3 (on a scale from 1 to
5).(38) Briefly, we used a semi-automated segmentation method
to trace the periosteal surface of the tibia and radius. After this, a
threshold-based algorithm separated the cortical and trabecular
bone. We report standard morphological measures including
total BMD (Tt.BMD, mg/cm3), trabecular number (Tb.N, 1/mm),
thickness (Tb.Th, mm), separation (Tb.Sp, mm), and bone volume
ratio (BV/TV). Additionally, we used an automated segmentation
algorithm to separate trabecular and cortical bone(39,40) to
determine total bone cross-sectional area (Tt.Ar, mm2), cortical
bone mineral density (Ct.BMD, mg/cm3), porosity (Ct.Po, %), and
thickness (Ct.Th, mm). Finally, we applied finite element (FE)
analysis to HR-pQCT images to estimate bone strength (failure
load; F.Load, N).(41) We simulated uniaxial compression up to 1%
strain using a single homogenous tissue modulus of 6829 MPa
and a Poisson ratio of 0.3.(41) We also calculated load-to-strength
ratio (distal radius only) as the ratio of estimated fall load applied
to the outstretched hand after a fall from standing height(42) and

Statistical analysis
We
performed
all
analyses
using
Stata,
version
12.1
(StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA). We considered p values
< 0.05 statistically significant. Before modeling our data, we
first examined scatter plots generated for bone strength and
its determinants against maturity offset for each participant.
We fit general linear mixed models (also called random
coefficients regression models or multilevel models) to
evaluate the influence of PA and sedentary time across
maturity. As in our previous analysis, we centered maturity
offset at 0, and we provide our process to determine the
best-fitting model for all bone parameters in Supplemental
Document S1.(17) Because our longitudinal data are made up
of repeated measures of attributes that change over time, it is
important to examine the interindividual variation (ie, differ-
ences between people) along with the intra-individual
variation (ie, differences over time within the same per-
son).(43) Therefore, all covariates were person-mean-centered,
such that the within-person (level 1) effect was represented
by the deviation from the individual’s mean value across years
(ie, MVPAti – MVPAi; where MVPAti is MVPA on measurement
occasion t in the ith individual and MVPAi is that individual’s
mean MVPA across years), while the between-person (level 2)
effect was represented by the individual’s mean value across
years.(44)
Once we determined the best-fitting growth model, which
included the fixed effects of sex and ethnicity, we developed a
series of models to address our primary and secondary
objectives—the longitudinal relationship between PA, seden-
tary time, and bone parameters. Model 1 included MVPA or
sedentary time as fixed effects. Model 2 also included covariates
known to influence bone parameters as fixed effects: lower leg
muscle power (muscle imposes the largest loads on bone),(32)
lean body mass (surrogate of muscle size), limb length
(surrogate of lever arm), and dietary calcium. We fit an additional
model for sedentary time (Model 3) that examined the influence
of sedentary time independent of MVPA (min/d). We checked
model
adequacy
graphically
using
plots
of
residuals.(45)
Diagnostic checking of fitted models revealed some serial
correlation in the residuals; however, attempting to incorporate
a serial correlation component into the model led to problems
with model convergence, an issue identified by others.(45)
Models that included serial correlation and only a random
intercept yielded similar results to the random coefficients-only
model. For models including a maturity by MVPA (or sedentary
time) interaction term, we calculated the marginal effect at each
biological age using the margins command in Stata and a
Bonferroni adjustment to account for multiple comparisons.
Because of few measurements at biological ages before 2 years
before APHV in girls (n ¼ 3) and after 9 years post-APHV in
boys (n ¼ 3), we limited our range of marginal effects from
2 years before APHV to 9 years post-APHV. Accordingly, the level
of statistical significance was set to p < 0.0042 (p < 0.05 divided
by 12 biological ages) for maturity by MVPA or sedentary time
interaction effects.
We rescaled results by the interquartile range (IQR) for MVPA
and sedentary time (adjusted for wear time) to account for
the substantially different volume of each type of activity
(ie, substantially lower volume of MVPA compared with
sedentary time). Thus, the reported coefficients represent
associations with bone parameters for every IQR increment in
MVPA or sedentary time (ie, difference in bone parameter
between an individual at the 75th percentile [upper quartile]
for MVPA or sedentary time compared with an individual at the
25th percentile [lower quartile] for MVPA or sedentary time).
The upper quartile for MVPA approximated current MVPA
recommendations(46) of 60 min/d (61 min/d), whereas the lower
quartile was <31 min/d. The upper quartile for sedentary
time approximated 11 hours/d, whereas the lower quartile
approximated 9 hours/d.
Results
Descriptive characteristics
A total of 309 participants (785 observations) and 257
participants (582 observations) met the inclusion criteria of
valid HR-pQCT and accelerometry data at the distal tibia and
distal radius, respectively. We provide participant characteristics,
including MVPA and sedentary time data at first HR-pQCT
measurement in Table 1 and bone parameters at first HR-pQCT
measurement in Table 2.
Twenty-four percent of our cohort (43% of boys, 9% of girls)
met the recommendations of 60 min/d of MVPA. MVPA
declined by roughly 31% across adolescence, from approxi-
mately 60 min/d in boys and 43 min/d in girls at 2 years before
APHV to 49 min/d in boys and 32 min/d in girls 9 years post-
APHV. On average, MVPA was significantly greater for boys
compared with girls across growth (�16 min/d difference,
p < 0.001). Sedentary time was not significantly different
between boys and girls (p ¼ 0.60) and increased by roughly
30% across adolescence, from approximately 8.1 hours/d at
2 years before APHV to 10.6 hours/d at 9 years post-APHV.
Moderate-to-vigorous physical activity and bone
parameters
We provide results of the mixed-effects models fit to examine
the longitudinal relationship between MVPA and bone
parameters across growth in Table 3. At the distal tibia,
between-person differences in MVPA positively predicted
BV/TV, Ct.Po, Tt.Ar, and F.Load in model 1 (adjusted for sex,
ethnicity, and maturity) and in model 2 (additionally adjusted
for
muscle
power,
limb
length,
and
dietary
calcium).
Participants in the upper quartile of MVPA (�60 min/d) had
approximately 4% greater BV/TV across growth compared
with their peers in the lowest quartile of MVPA (�<30 min/d;
Fig. 1). We observed a significant interaction between MVPA
and maturity for Ct.Po, Tt.Ar, and F.Load, whereby partic-
ipants in the upper quartile of MVPA had approximately 13%
greater Ct.Po between APHV and 2 years post-APHV; 4% to
6% greater Tt.Ar between 2 years before APHV and 2 years
post-APHV; and 6% greater F.Load at all ages (except at
9 years post-APHV; p ¼ 0.06) compared with their peers in
the lowest quartile of MVPA (Supplemental Fig. S2). Within-
person change in MVPA did not significantly predict bone
parameters at the distal tibia.
At the distal radius, between-person differences in MVPA
positively predicted BV/TV and F.Load and negatively predicted

 load-to-strength ratio in both models. Participants in the upper
quartile of MVPA (�60 min/d) had approximately 4% greater
BV/TV and 6% greater F.Load compared with their peers in the
lowest quartile of MVPA (�<30 min/d; Fig. 2) across growth. We
observed a significant interaction between MVPA and maturity
for load-to-strength ratio, whereby participants in the upper
quartile of MVPA had approximately 8% to 13% lower load-to-
strength ratio between 2 years before APHV and 1 year
post-APHV compared with their peers in the lower quartile of
MVPA (Supplemental Fig. S2). Within-person change in MVPA
did not significantly predict bone parameters in either model at
the distal radius.
Sedentary time and bone parameters
We present results of the mixed-effects models used to examine
the longitudinal relationship between sedentary time and bone
parameters across growth at the distal tibia in Table 4. Between-
person differences in sedentary time negatively predicted Tt.Ar
and F.Load and positively predicted Tb.Th, Ct.Th, and Ct.BMD in
model 1 (adjusted for sex, ethnicity, and maturity) and model 2
(additionally adjusted for muscle power, limb length, and
dietary). Associations persisted after additional adjustment for
MVPA (model 3), with the exception of F.Load, which was no
longer negatively associated with sedentary time (p ¼ 0.15).

Discussion
The HBSIII study is the longest prospective study conducted to
date that spans the adolescent growth spurt and that used
HR-pQCT to examine the tibia and radius. Key elements of our
study include aligning girls and boys on a common maturational
landmark and using an objective measure of MVPA and
sedentary time. We provide unique insight into consequences
of loading and unloading the skeleton during adolescent
growth. Our results suggest that adolescents who participate in
more intense physical activity (MVPA) have greater trabecular
bone tissue volume at both skeletal sites and greater bone
area at the tibia, which contribute to superior bone strength.
Conversely, sedentary adolescents have smaller bones (Tt.Ar), on
average, but greater Tb.Th, Ct.Th, and Ct.BMD at the tibia. Our
findings also highlight the maturity-specific nature of bone’s
response to loading and unloading and suggest that early and
mid-puberty may be particularly important years to target these
behaviors.
Physical activity and bone strength
The osteogenic effects of PA are irrefutable.(47) We extend the
relatively few longitudinal studies that used HR-pQCT to
characterize growing bone. In doing so, we also extend the
evidence that supports the key role of MVPA as a predictor of
bone strength at both the tibia and radius across growth in boys
and girls. Our findings are consistent with a recent longitudinal
study that used pQCT to assess bone(8) and previous cross-
sectional studies that demonstrated a significant association
between objectively measured PA (via accelerometer or
pedometer) and pQCT-(5,6) and HR-pQCT-(7) estimated bone
strength. In our recent analysis of the HBSIII cohort, bone
strength (F.Load by HR-pQCT) increased by approximately 47%
to 65% in boys and 59% to 91% in girls at the distal tibia
and radius in the 4 years around peak growth.(17) Considering
the strong influence of maturation and other biological
determinants of bone strength (ie, genetic factors account for
approximately 83% of distal radius and 61% of tibial bone
strength by pQCT),(48) we view the significant relationship of
MVPA with bone strength across growth in girls and boys as
meaningful.

INFLUENCE OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY ON BONE STRENGTH DURING GROWTH
1531
 To our knowledge, this is the first study to show significant
positive associations of habitual MVPA with bone strength at
the distal radius. Greater bone strength in adolescents
that engaged in more MVPA also contributed to a lower load-
to-strength ratio, indicating a lower risk of forearm fracture.
The weight-bearing tibia is more sensitive to environmental
factors (ie, mechanical loading due to locomotion) compared
with the radius.(48) Further, counts from accelerometers worn at
the hip were strongly associated with ground reaction forces(49)
and accurately quantified energy expenditure of upper limb
activities.(50) Although counterintuitive at first glance, a similar
influence of PA at both skeletal sites may be because of
participants predominantly engaging in higher-intensity activi-
ties that demand concordant upper- and lower-body move-
ments (eg, walking, running) and that stimulate movement and
muscular contraction in both upper and lower limbs.
Metaphyseal sites are primarily loaded in axial compression,
whereby bone’s ability to resist loading (bone strength) is
roughly proportional to the product of total bone cross-
sectional area (CSA) and the square of bone density.(51) Thus,
adding bone mass to the periosteal surface during growth
substantially increases compressive bone strength. Our finding
that MVPA positively predicted Tt.Ar at the distal tibia in early
and mid-puberty is consistent with previous studies in children
and adolescents that demonstrated a positive relationship
between PA (via accelerometry or self-report) and CSA (by DXA
and HSA) at the narrow neck, intertrochanter and proximal
femur shaft,(52) periosteal circumference at the tibial shaft (by
pQCT),(53) and Tt.Ar at the distal tibia (by HR pQCT).(7,54) Given
that Tt.Ar at the distal tibia tends to plateau approximately
3 years after APHV,(17) the period of accelerated growth during
early and mid-puberty represents the previously reported
“window of opportunity” to enhance bone geometry through
the osteogenic effect of PA.(47)
To our knowledge, ours is also the first longitudinal study to
examine adaptation of trabecular microarchitecture to PA
during adolescence. Our findings suggest that PA-related
adaptations in trabecular volume likely contribute to greater
bone strength in more-active youth. The positive association we
observed between MVPA and BV/TV at both skeletal sites across
growth is consistent with our previous cross-sectional studies,
where we observed a positive association between MVPA and
BV/TV(7) and self-reported loaded PA with Tb.BMD in adolescent
girls at the distal tibia.(54) The adaptation of trabecular tissue
volume to mechanical loading may serve to more efficiently
transfer compressive loads from the joint surfaces and increase
bone’s mechanical competence.(55) That we did not observe an
association of PA with Tb.Th is consistent with a cross-sectional
study in collegiate gymnasts that found no difference in Tb.Th
(assessed using high-resolution MRI) between gymnasts and
controls.(56) However, our findings are in contrast to animal
studies that reported significant gains in Tb.Th in response to
mechanical loading.(57,58) There is a need for intervention studies
to clarify trabecular bone adaptation to PA during adolescence.
Physical activity and cortical bone
Until recently, assessment of cortical microarchitecture at
metaphyseal sites was not possible because low-resolution
imaging devices precluded quantification of thickness and

 porosity at sites with thin cortices, such as at the distal radius.
Thus the influence of habitual PA on Ct.BMD and micro-
architecture remained unclear. In the current study, we did not
observe a relationship between MVPA and Ct.BMD in either sex
during growth. These findings are consistent with our previous
cross-sectional HR-pQCT studies where we did not observe an
association of PA (self-reported(54) and accelerometry-derived
MVPA(7)) with Ct.BMD at the distal tibia. Similarly, cross-sectional
studies of young athletes who participated in weight-bearing
sports showed very little adaptation of Ct.BMD to loading at
metaphyseal and diaphyseal sites.(55,59–61) Given that the
metaphyseal cortex is rapidly modeling during periods of
accelerated growth,(62) it is possible that greater mechanical
loads applied during this period may delay consolidation of
cortical bone because of incomplete trabecular coalescence or
increased intracortical remodeling.
We found no relationship between Ct.Th and MVPA, which is
consistent with our previous cross-sectional HR-pQCT study
where we reported no association between weight-bearing PA
(self-reported) and Ct.Th at the distal tibia in adolescents.(54) The
influence of PA on Ct.Th may be maturity- and site-specific,
whereby prepubertal children and diaphyseal sites may be
particularly responsive to adaptation to weight-bearing PA. For
example, at diaphyseal sites, PA was positively associated with
Ct.Th (by pQCT) in prepubertal children(55,63,64) but not in a
cohort of pre-, peri-, and late-pubertal girls.(53) The influence of
PA on metaphyseal cortical porosity is equally uncertain, which
may be partially because of the inability of HR-pQCT to resolve
small pores, especially in growing children and adolescents.(65)
Thus, future studies that use higher-resolution technology (ie,
XtremeCT II, 61-mm imaging resolution) may serve to clarify
cortical microarchitectural adaptations to loading.
Sedentary time and bone parameters
Mechanistically, being excessively sedentary may negatively
affect bone health by disrupting the bone formation-resorption
balance, as occurs in immobilized individuals.(66) However, it is
unclear how sedentary time may affect healthy, ambulatory
children and adolescents, and interact with or counter the
osteogenic effects of PA. As in our previous cross-sectional study
of the distal tibia in adolescents,(7) we did not discern an
association of bone strength with sedentary time independent
of MVPA during adolescence. An apparent paradox exists
whereby our cohort spent most of their waking hours (�70% of
the day) in sedentary pursuits; however, this did not preclude
their participation in PA. For example, although deemed
sedentary, participants experienced mechanical loading and
engaged in daily MVPA at levels comparable with other
Canadian youth (59 min/d versus 53 min/d in adolescent boys
and 41 min/d versus 39 min/d in adolescent girls).(9) Thus, the
potentially detrimental effect of sedentariness on bone strength
may be offset by the overriding osteogenic effect of MVPA.
In contrast to this hypothesis, MVPA did not attenuate the
detrimental relationship between sedentary time and bone
geometry at the distal tibia. That is, sedentary adolescents had
lower Tt.Ar, independent of MVPA during mid- to late puberty.
These results were in contrast to our previous cross-sectional
study where sedentary time was not associated with Tt.Ar.(7) It
appears that a high volume of sedentary time in and of itself,
beyond displacing PA, may be detrimental to periosteal
expansion.
Although
the
precise
mechanism
is
unclear,
periosteal apposition (as estimated by change in Tt.Ar) would
be attenuated based on a reduced mechanical stimuli associated
with sedentariness. Experimental dose-response studies are
needed to advance our understanding of mechanisms by which
sedentary behaviors negatively influence periosteal apposition.
The positive association between sedentary time and
trabecular and cortical bone microarchitecture and density at
the distal tibia during mid-puberty was unexpected and
challenged our hypothesis. It may be that bone tissue is
distributed and mineralized differently in adolescents who have
smaller bones (because of lower levels of mechanical loading) as
a means to maximize bone strength. Alternatively, high levels of
PA may provide an osteogenic stimulus, whereas a high volume
of sedentary time may promote bone consolidation. A similar
positive association between sedentary time and bone mineral
content (by DXA) was observed at the spine and proximal femur
in adolescents and young adults, independent of MVPA.(67) Our
finding might be explained by experimental studies that
demonstrated the importance of recovery periods between
loading bouts for optimal biomechanical adaptation and to
restore mechano-sensitivity of bone cells.(68,69) That sedentary
time and MVPA both positively predicted BV/TV, Tb.Th, Ct.Th,
and Ct.BMD at the distal tibia was also unexpected. The
correlation between MVPA and sedentary time was r ¼ �0.59,
which did not prompt concerns of collinearity (Variance Inflation
Factor of 1.5). This scenario suggests that not all sedentary
time is detrimental and a highly active adolescent may benefit
from also being highly sedentary (an “active couch potato”),(70)
as a means to “recover” and enhance bone microarchitecture
and BMD.
The sedentary time–bone relationship was maturity-specific,
such that sedentary individuals had thicker and denser cortices
during mid- to late puberty (post-APHV). The metaphyseal
cortex is rapidly modeled during early puberty; thus, bone
turnover is elevated in both active and sedentary individuals.
Beyond APHV, when longitudinal growth and bone modeling
are reduced, differential adaptation of bone tissue to mechanical
loading (ie, active versus sedentary adolescents) may be more
apparent. For example, whereas intracortical remodeling and
periosteal apposition are heightened in active adolescents
because of greater mechanical loading, cortical bone consoli-
dation may be greater in sedentary adolescents because of
lower
intracortical
remodeling
and
periosteal
apposition
associated with reduced mechanical stimuli. Regardless of
differences in bone tissue distribution, the larger bones of active
adolescents provide them a bone strength advantage at the
distal tibia throughout adolescence. Future investigations into
the pattern of sedentary time accumulation (ie, long bouts of
extended sedentary time versus short bouts of sedentary time
interspersed with PA) may help clarify the mechanism by which
sedentary time influences bone microarchitecture. Further,
because Ct.BMD varies within the bone cross section(71) and
bone adaptation is region-specific,(72) incorporating regional
analysis into future HR-pQCT studies may shed light on the
complex nature of bone adaptation to loading and unloading
during growth.
We did not observe an association of within-person differ-
ences in MVPA or sedentary time with bone parameters
throughout growth. Thus, habitual activity may be a stronger
predictor of bone strength and its determinants in general
populations of youth compared with individual changes in these
behaviors from one year to the next. This may be a function of
the lengthy bone modeling process, which requires 4 to
6 months to complete.(73) Significant time is therefore required

 for changes in the loading environment to be discernable in the
skeleton.
We acknowledge several limitations of our study. First, as in
any repeated measures study of growing bone, it is not possible
to measure exactly the same bone cross section over time.
Therefore, we used a standard anatomical landmark to identify
the same relative site along the length of the tibia and radius at
each measurement in each participant. Second, we did not
assess endocrine markers that represent activation of the
hypothalamic-gonadal-pituitary axis or hand-wrist X-rays of
skeletal maturity. Instead, we aligned participants on a common
maturational landmark, age at peak height velocity, as a means
to control for the significant variation in maturation of children
of the same chronological age. Third, our analysis was limited to
peripheral sites and may not represent relationships between
bone outcomes, MVPA, and sedentary time at clinically relevant
central sites. However, distal tibia parameters (by HR-pQCT) also
reflected the mechanical competence of the central skeleton (ie,
proximal femur and lumbar spine).(74) Thus, increases in tibial
bone strength owing to PA may also indicate gains in strength at
clinically relevant central sites. Fourth, high variability of Ct.Po
may obscure the PA/sedentary time-bone relationship. Finally,
uniaxial accelerometers do not directly measure ground
reaction forces, nor can they accurately capture certain activities
(ie, bicycling or carrying loads) or distinguish between different
sedentary postures, such as sitting, standing, and lying down.
Thus, it is possible that some activities were underrepresented in
our measures of PA and standing time may have been included
in estimates of sedentary time.
Despite these limitations, our study was uniquely positioned
to examine the influence of PA and sedentary time on growth-
related adaptations in bone strength and parameters that
underpin bone strength across adolescence. Our study adds a
unique perspective to evidence regarding the positive benefits
of PA on bone strength and its determinants through childhood
into adolescence. This relationship appears to be driven
primarily by greater trabecular volume at distal sites, in concert
with greater bone area at the tibia.
We also provide new evidence that sedentary time may be
detrimental to bone geometry independent of PA. However,
sedentary time may also be beneficial to some bone parameters
in the presence of high levels of PA. Further investigation into
patterns of PA and sedentary time accumulation and specific
dose-response studies may shed light on the optimal dose of
loading and recovery to enhance bone strength and its
determinants during growth. Future studies should also
examine these behaviors over a longer time frame to establish
whether the benefits of habitual PA during childhood and
adolescence persist into mid- and late-adulthood and how they
influence fracture risk. As the beneficial role of PA for bone is well
established,(1) interventions that address the significant declines
in MVPA and concurrent increases in sedentary time during
adolescence are warranted.
