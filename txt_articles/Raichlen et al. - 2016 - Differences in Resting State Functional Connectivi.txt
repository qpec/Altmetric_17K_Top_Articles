Expertise and training in fine motor skills has been associated with changes in brain
structure, function, and connectivity. Fewer studies have explored the neural effects of
athletic activities that do not seem to rely on precise fine motor control (e.g., distance
running). Here, we compared resting-state functional connectivity in a sample of adult
male collegiate distance runners (n = 11; age = 21.3 ± 2.5) and a group of healthy age-
matched non-athlete male controls (n = 11; age = 20.6 ± 1.1), to test the hypothesis
that expertise in sustained aerobic motor behaviors affects resting state functional
connectivity in young adults. Although generally considered an automated repetitive
task, locomotion, especially at an elite level, likely engages multiple cognitive actions
including planning, inhibition, monitoring, attentional switching and multi-tasking, and
motor control. Here, we examined connectivity in three resting-state networks that
link such executive functions with motor control: the default mode network (DMN),
the frontoparietal network (FPN), and the motor network (MN). We found two key
patterns of significant between-group differences in connectivity that are consistent
with the hypothesized cognitive demands of elite endurance running. First, enhanced
connectivity between the FPN and brain regions often associated with aspects of
working memory and other executive functions (frontal cortex), suggest endurance
running may stress executive cognitive functions in ways that increase connectivity
in associated networks. Second, we found significant anti-correlations between the
DMN and regions associated with motor control (paracentral area), somatosensory
functions (post-central region), and visual association abilities (occipital cortex). DMN
deactivation with task-positive regions has been shown to be generally beneficial for
cognitive performance, suggesting anti-correlated regions observed here are engaged
during running. For all between-group differences, there were significant associations
between connectivity, self-reported physical activity, and estimates of maximum aerobic
capacity, suggesting a dose-response relationship between engagement in endurance
running and connectivity strength. Together these results suggest that differences in

experience with endurance running are associated with differences in functional brain
connectivity. High intensity aerobic activity that requires sustained, repetitive locomotor
and navigational skills may stress cognitive domains in ways that lead to altered brain
connectivity, which in turn has implications for understanding the beneficial role of
exercise for brain and cognitive function over the lifespan.

INTRODUCTION
Expertise and training in motor skills is often associated with
changes in brain structure and function (Dayan and Cohen,
2011). Long-term training in activities that require precise fine
motor control (e.g., musical training) can lead to structural
changes in brain areas that are linked to motor function, as well
as in cortical areas involved in sensory, spatial, and attentional
processes (Gaser and Schlaug, 2003; Han et al., 2009; Jäncke
et al., 2009; Park et al., 2009). Recent work has also shown that
expertise in athletic activities that demand high levels of hand-eye
coordination, such as golf (Jäncke et al., 2009), gymnastics (Wang
et al., 2016), or racquet sports (Di et al., 2012), can alter brain
structure and function. However, fewer studies have explored the
neural effects of athletic activities that do not seem to require
precise motor control (e.g., distance running). Here, we examine
potential neuroplasticity associated with expertise in endurance
running, a sport that is thought to involve sustained aerobic
activity over time with more repetitive rather than complex fine
motor skills (Schlaffke et al., 2014).
There is some limited evidence that accomplished endurance
athletes have differences in brain structure compared with non-
athletes. Highly skilled endurance athletes have enhanced white
matter (WM) tracts and greater gray matter volume in the
medial temporal lobes compared with more sedentary controls
(Schlaffke et al., 2014; Chang et al., 2015). More generally,
recent studies have shown that engaging in aerobic exercise
(e.g., moderate intensity walking) may alter and improve brain
structure and function (Cotman and Berchtold, 2002; Colcombe
et al., 2003, 2006; Kramer et al., 2006; Erickson et al., 2011). While
much of this work has been focused on older adults, young adults
have regionally specific, exercise-related increases in gray matter
and WM tract integrity (Marks et al., 2007; Peters et al., 2009;
Killgore et al., 2013). Thus, exercise in general, and expertise in
endurance athletics specifically, may have important beneficial
effects on brain structure and connectivity, with the potential to
enhance cognitive resilience over the lifespan.
While exercise-related effects may be the result of non-specific
molecular signaling cascades (see Raichlen and Polk, 2013), it
is also possible that the cognitive benefits of exercise occur
because locomotion is not simply an automated repetitive motor
task, but is instead a highly complex behavior that involves
domains related to both motor and cognitive functions (Yogev-
Seligmann et al., 2008). For example, walking or running through
complex environments can engage several components of
executive function including volition, self-awareness, planning,
inhibition, monitoring, attentional switching and multi-tasking,
in addition to motor control (Yogev-Seligmann et al., 2008).
Highly competitive endurance athletes actually seem to have
improved performance when using their attentional focus (e.g.,
focusing on technique or sensory systems) rather than allowing
their minds to wander, suggesting cognitive demands may be high
during intense exercise bouts (see Brick et al., 2014 for review).
In fact, the use of associative cognitive strategies increases as
pace or effort increases (Tammen, 1996), and high-level runners
use specific strategies to control cognition during intense bouts
(Brick et al., 2015). This differs from episodes of distraction or
mind-wandering that are reported in less demanding exercise
bouts (Brick et al., 2015) or in novice runners (Schücker et al.,
2016).
Imaging studies (e.g., fNIRS and EEG) performed during
locomotion support the hypothesis that movement can be

motor
control. Locomotion activates several brain regions, including
prefrontal, parietal, and parahippocampal regions, which are
often associated with executive functions, spatial navigation, and
memory (Hamacher et al., 2015), and high-speed locomotion
(e.g., running) increases the cognitive demands and associated
neural activity (Suzuki et al., 2004; Hamacher et al., 2015). These
studies suggest that locomotion in general, and high-speed
locomotion specifically, engages several cognitive domains in
ways that, over time, may alter brain structure, function, and
connectivity.
To examine the relationship between competitive endurance
exercise and the brain, we investigated brain function in expert
endurance athletes and age-matched, non-athlete adults. We
defined expertise in endurance sports following Baker et al.
(2005) by identifying individuals based primarily on time spent
in sport-specific training along with the achievement of high
levels of performance (i.e., participation on a collegiate-level team
indicating faster finishing times than age-matched non-experts).
We compared groups using functional connectivity magnetic
resonance imaging (fcMRI) assessed in the resting state, since
functional brain networks have been previously suggested to play
a role in the beneficial effects of exercise on cognition in older
adults (see Burdette et al., 2010; Voss et al., 2010a,c). Resting-
state fcMRI networks are observed using the blood oxygenation
level-dependent (BOLD) signal when subjects are not actively
performing a goal directed task, reflecting regionally distinct
but functionally connected brain areas. Such network functional
connectivity is thought to influence performance across many
cognitive domains, and changes in fcMRI have been observed in
the context of aging and in neurodegenerative diseases that are
associated with diminished cognitive performance (Damoiseaux
et al., 2008; Tomasi and Volkow, 2012). There is mounting
evidence that exercise training in older adults can significantly

Resting fcMRI in Endurance Athletes
increase functional connectivity within several fcMRI resting
networks whose function is altered during both healthy and
pathological aging (Burdette et al., 2010; Voss et al., 2010c). In
addition, a single acute bout of exercise in young adults can lead
to increased connectivity in sensorimotor fcMRI networks (Rajab
et al., 2014).
Here, we investigated differences between expert endurance
athletes and non-athlete young adult controls in three previously
reported fcMRI resting-state networks that are either known
to be affected by exercise, or are associated with cognitive
domains influenced by physical activity (e.g., aspects of executive
function and motor abilities): the default mode network (DMN),
the frontoparietal network (FPN), and the motor network
(MN). The DMN is the most widely studied fcMRI network
(Ferreira and Busatto, 2013) and typically includes the medial
prefrontal cortex, the hippocampus, the inferior parietal lobule,
and the posterior cingulate cortex (Raichle et al., 2001; Buckner
et al., 2008). The DMN is a network highly active at rest
that is often associated with mind-wandering (Mason et al.,
2007). Task-based deactivation of the DMN is associated with
executive function, in addition to performance in other cognitive
domains (Raichle et al., 2001; Greicius et al., 2003; Damoiseaux
et al., 2008). Previous work has shown that, in older adults,
exercise interventions affect DMN connectivity (Voss et al.,
2010c). The FPN is a brain network that has been associated
with executive functions, attention, and motor control (Seeley
et al., 2007; Vincent et al., 2008; Pammi et al., 2012; Hsu
et al., 2014), and often includes the anterior insula, the
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the anterior prefrontal region,
the dorsomedial superior frontal/anterior cingulate area, and
the anterior inferior parietal lobule (Vincent et al., 2008). The
MN is a functional brain network that has been associated with
resting state connectivity involving the left and right motor
cortices (Biswal et al., 1995). We hypothesized that individuals
who engage in highly intense aerobic exercise (i.e., competitive
endurance cross-country running) would differ in resting state
functional connectivity in these networks compared with more
sedentary, non-athlete controls due to the intense demands on
executive functions that are intrinsically linked with such motor
activities.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Sample
Twenty-two healthy young adults, 18–
25 years of age, were
recruited
to
participate
in
the
study.
All
subjects
were
screened for any history of significant medical, neurological,
or psychiatric injuries and disorders, which might affect
brain structure or function. Additionally, participants were
excluded if they had implants or dental work that would
preclude magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning. The
participants included 11 male athletes and 11 age-matched
male non-athlete controls. The athlete group was comprised
of highly fit male distance runners, recruited from teams
and clubs in the Tucson-metro areas currently competing in
the NCAA junior college division. The age- and sex-matched
non-athlete controls were recruited from the community and
were individuals not currently participating in purposeful
exercise and who have not participated in regular exercise or
organized sports during the last year. The characteristics of the
participants in the study are shown in Table 1. All participants
provided informed written consent for the study, which was
approved by the University of Arizona Institutional Review
Board.
Aerobic Fitness Assessments
Three measures were used to assess levels of exercise engagement
and overall aerobic fitness. We first grouped participants based
on their reported participation in organized endurance sports
(cross-country runners were placed in the athlete group; controls
were placed in the non-athlete control group). Second, we used
a physical activity questionnaire (PAQ) to determine total self-
reported amounts of physical activity on a continuous scale
that incorporates information on the types and intensity of
activities, as well as hours over time periods spent (Voorrips
et al., 1991). Third, we calculated an estimated fitness score (in
metabolic equivalents or METs) based on anthropometrics and
exercise participation following Jurca et al. (2005). Briefly, this
score, which differs from questions in the PAQ, combines a
self-reported ordinal scale of exercise engagement (i.e., subjects
placed in one of five levels of time spent in aerobic activity
each week) with body mass index (BMI), age, sex, and resting
heart rate (collected after 5 min of quiet rest) to estimate
maximal aerobic capacity or VO2max, expressed in METs (where
1 MET = 3.5 ml O2 kg−1min−1). While the PAQ and MET
values are correlated in our sample (r2 = 0.58; p < 0.001), 42%
of the variance in PAQ is not explained by estimated VO2max,
suggesting engagement and cardiovascular fitness are measuring
different aspects of exercise. Finally, a subset of our sample (n = 5
athletes; n = 6 non-athletes) completed a graded exercise test to
quantitatively measure VO2max. We used the Costill/Fox protocol
(Costill and Fox, 1969) to determine maximum aerobic capacity.
This protocol consists of changes in both speed and incline,

and is considered appropriate for determining VO2max in both
untrained and in highly trained aerobic athletes (Kang et al.,
2001).
Imaging Methods
MRI Procedures
Magnetic resonance imaging scans were acquired on a long-
bore 3.0T GE Signa scanner (General Electric, Milwaukee, WI,
USA). Resting state fcMRI scans were obtained while participants
were resting comfortably in the scanner with eyes open for a
period of 6 min consisting of 150 volumes using a gradient-echo
echo-planar imaging sequence (TE = 30 ms, TR = 2400 ms,
FA = 90◦, FOV = 25.6 cm × 25.6 cm, matrix = 64 × 64,
32 contiguous 3.8 mm slices). The first four image volumes
were discarded to allow the BOLD signal to reach steady state.
T1-weighted 3D SPGR anatomical MRI scans were acquired
during the same scanning session (TE = 2.0 ms, TR = 5.3 ms,
FA = 15.0◦, FOV = 25.6 cm × 25.6 cm, matrix = 256 × 256, slice
thickness = 1.0 mm).
Image Analysis
Images were processed using the CONN functional connectivity
toolbox v15.a (Whitfield-Gabrieli and Nieto-Castanon, 20121)
and SPM122. Preprocessing procedures involved inter-frame
motion correction and unwarping, slice timing correction,
co-registration of the functional images to their respective
anatomical MRI images, structural segmentation and spatial
normalization, and functional spatial normalization. A motion
and outlier scrubbing step was included using the Artifact
Detection Tools software (ART3), to identify scans affected
by movement-related artifacts, following which the functional
images were smoothed using a Gaussian kernel of 8 mm full-
width at half maximum.
Several potentially confounding sources of signal variation
were removed by linear regression. These included six head
motion parameters, signals from the white matter (WM) and
cerebrospinal fluid, and the outlier scans detected during the
scrubbing process. In the CONN toolbox, motion outliers are
identified using ART, where the combination of translational and
rotational voxel displacements are derived from the frame-to-
frame trajectory of six control points placed at the center of the
six faces of the brain image bounding box. For signal outliers,
the mean signal across the entire time series was computed
and Z-transformed. Frames were classified as outliers if either
the composite motion from the combination of translational
and rotational displacements exceeded 2mm or the global mean
signal exceeded 9 SD or both (Whitfield-Gabrieli and Nieto-
Castanon, 2012; Ely et al., 2016). With this approach, the number
of outlier volumes detected ranged from 0 to 4.6% of the total
fcMRI volumes per participant. In addition, the groups did
not differ in the composite average, maximum, and absolute
maximum measures of head motion [t(20) ≤ 0.53, p’
s ≥ 0.60].

3https://www.nitrc.org/projects/artifact_detect/
Importantly, the CONN software uses an anatomical component-
based noise correction method (aCompCor) (Behzadi et al.,
2007) that does not rely on average global signal regression to
remove sources of noise in the BOLD time series data (Whitfield-
Gabrieli and Nieto-Castanon, 2012), and instead derives the
principal components from the WM and cerebrospinal fluid
regions using the high resolution T1 scan. As such, observed
anti-correlations in the fcMRI connectivity analyses are not
attributable to potential biases from global signal regression
artifacts (Chai et al., 2012, 2014). Finally, a temporal band pass
filter (0.008 to 0.09 Hz) was applied to this residual BOLD signal.
The time course of this filtered BOLD signal from 4 mm
radius spherical regions for regional seeds in the FPN, DMN,
and MN, defined by Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) brain
coordinates as reported by Vincent et al. (2008), were correlated
with every other brain voxel’
s time course to obtain brain maps
of correlation coefficients for each participant. For the FPN, seed
regions in the left and right anterior prefrontal cortex (MNI
coordinates: −36, 57, 3 and 36, 57, 3) and inferior parietal
lobule (MNI coordinates: −44, −52, 54 and 48, −50, 52) were
used. For the DMN, seed regions were localized in the posterior
cingulate (MNI coordinates: 0, −53, 26), medial prefrontal cortex
(MNI coordinates: 0, 54, −4) and left and right inferior parietal
lobule (MNI coordinates: −46, −48, 36 and 50, −62, 32). Seed
regions for the MN included seeds selected from the left and right
motor cortex (MNI coordinates: −42, −25, 63 and 42, −25, 63).
Brain maps showing the average correlation and anti-correlation
networks for the conjunction of the seed region maps across all 22
participants for the FPN, DMN, and MN are shown in Figure 1.
Statistical Analysis
The participant maps of the correlations between the fcMRI
seed regions and all voxels of the brain were entered into a
second-level group analysis, using a two sample t-test to test
for between group differences where either athletes showed
significantly greater connectivity values than controls, or where
controls showed significantly greater values than athletes. Group
differences were tested for connectivity values (fisher transformed
correlation coefficients). The average functional connectivity
values for each participant from suprathreshold voxel clusters
were extracted to test within-group connectivity differences from
zero with one-sample t-test and their relation to measures of
physical and estimated metabolic activity with linear regressions.
For all fcMRI connectivity values, significance was taken by
applying both an uncorrected p < 0.001 for magnitude and an
FDR corrected p < 0.05 for spatial extent. Group differences in
subject characteristics were tested with a t-test and the Fisher’

physical activity. Although available for only a subset of the
participants, the athlete group had significantly higher measured
VO2max values compared to the non-athlete controls (Table 1).
Furthermore, we used these measured values to evaluate the
estimated VO2max values (METs) for subsequent analyses with
the brain imaging data. We found the measured VO2max values
and the estimated values were strongly correlated (r = 0.73;
p = 0.01), and the athletes had significantly higher estimated
VO2max values compared to the controls. Finally, self reported
levels of physical activity were significantly higher in the athlete
group compared to controls (Table 1).
There were several between-group differences in functional
connectivity involving each of the three resting state fcMRI
networks. In testing where the athletes were greater than the
controls using seeds in the FPN, the two groups had significantly
different patterns of connectivity between two network seeds
and three frontal brain regions. The athletes had significantly
higher functional connectivity values than controls between a
right parietal seed in the FPN and a region in the vicinity
of the right superior/mid frontal region (Figure 2; Table 2).
This difference reflected a significant positive connectivity value
during the resting state in the athlete group and no significant
value from zero in the non-athlete control group. The athletes
also had significantly greater connectivity than controls between
a seed in the left anterior FPN and an area in the vicinity of the left
superior/mid frontal regions (Figure 2; Table 2). This between-
group difference was reflected by a strong positive connectivity
value between regions in the athletes and a significant anti-
correlation between regions in the non-athlete control group.
Finally, the athletes differed significantly in connectivity values
from controls between a seed region in the left anterior FPN
and an area in the vicinity of the right superior frontal and
supplementary motor regions. The between-group difference
reflected an anti-correlation between regions in the non-athlete
control group, and no significant values from zero between
these regions in the athlete group (Table 2). For the FPN, no
significant regional differences were observed where the controls
were greater than the athletes.
Using seeds in the DMN, the athletes and non-athletes differed
in connectivity between network seed regions and six other brain
regions. Using a medial prefrontal seed in the DMN, the athletes
showed significantly different functional connectivity with two
clusters of voxels. First, testing where the controls were greater
than the athletes, the athletes had a significant anti-correlation
between the medial prefrontal seed region and a region in the
vicinity of the right post-central gyrus, while the non-athlete
controls did not show a significant value from zero in this region
(Figure 3; Table 3). Testing where the athletes were greater
than the controls, the medial prefrontal seed showed a positive
connectivity value with a subcortical region in the frontal WM
of the athletes, while the control group had a significant anti-
correlation between the medial prefrontal seed and this WM
region (Figure 3; Table 3).
In testing where the controls were greater than the athletes,
using a seed in the posterior cingulate region of the DMN, the
athletes showed a significant anti-correlation with an area in the
vicinity of the right post-central and superior parietal region,
while the non-athlete controls did not differ from zero in the
association with this region (Figure 3; Table 3). Testing where
the controls were greater than the athletes, with a seed in the
left parietal region of the DMN, the athletes had significant anti-
correlations with regions in the vicinity of the right and left lateral
occipital cortex, while the non-athlete adults had significant
positive connectivity values with these two regions (Figure 3;
Table 3). Using this same left parietal seed region of the DMN,
but testing where the athletes were greater than controls, the non-
athlete adults had a significant anti-correlation with a region in
the vicinity in the left paracentral area, while the athletes did not
show a significant value from zero in association with this region
(Figure 3; Table 3). There were no other significant regional
differences between groups for the relation between the DMN
seeds and other brain regions.
Finally, testing where the controls were greater than athletes
using seeds in the MN, there was a significant between group
difference in connectivity between a seed in the right MN and
a region in the vicinity of the posterior cingulate cortex. This
between group difference was due to a significant anti-correlation
in the athlete group and no significant value from zero in the
non-athlete control group (Figure 4; Table 4). There were no
significant regional differences where the athletes were greater
than controls in association between the MN seeds and any brain
region.

values extracted from each region that was related to the
corresponding network seed and self-reported physical activity
scores (Figures 2–4). Similarly, significant linear associations
were found between regional values at each of these regions
and the composite MET scores (Figures 2–4). Slopes for the
best-fit linear regression lines were negative when between-group
differences were reflected by stronger regional anti-correlations
in the athlete group, and were positive when the between-group
regional differences were driven by stronger positive regional
connectivity values in the athlete group.
DISCUSSION
Our results suggest that engagement in high levels of aerobic
activity in young adulthood is associated with differences in
resting state functional connectivity in networks known to
be linked to executive function and motor control compared
with more sedentary individuals. This is the first study, to
our knowledge, to show that high levels of participation and
expertise in endurance running are reflected by differences in
the resting state fcMRI networks of young adults. In addition,
there appears to be a dose-response effect of participating in
highly intense activity on resting-state functional connectivity.
The linear regressions showed that time spent in highly aerobic
activities, and higher levels of aerobic fitness (estimated VO2max),
were associated with greater connectivity values across the
sample. These findings are consistent with those observed in
studies of older adults that suggest aerobic exercise and fitness
are associated with neuroplasticity in resting state networks
(Burdette et al., 2010; Voss et al., 2010a,c).
Our results show that differences between expert endurance
athletes and non-athlete young adults included both enhanced
positive connectivity, as well as anti-correlations between
regions. The detection of between-group differences suggests
that athletes may stress cognitive domains in ways that reflect
underlying connections across key brain regions. Strengthened
connectivity may be associated with histories of co-activation of
linked regions (Guerra-Carrillo et al., 2014), suggesting high-
level endurance running may engage these connected regions,
while enhancing connectivity through increased aerobic activity.

Previous researchers have hypothesized that negative associations
between resting state regions may reflect the resolution of
conflicting cognitive demands, and anti-correlations between the
DMN and task-positive regions have been linked to improved
cognitive performance in recent work (see Fox et al., 2006;
Keller et al., 2015). Thus, anti-correlations may reflect out of
phase functional associations between resting state network brain
regions or with those extra-network brain areas engaged during
overt cognitive activity.
While there is some debate over the cognitive implications of
between group differences in resting state functional connectivity
networks (Cole et al., 2010), the increased connectivity between
select brain regions and the FPN, the DMN, and the MN is
consistent with links between motor control and the implicit
cognitive demands of high intensity endurance running activity.
As described earlier, movement, especially at high speeds, taxes
not only motor control, but can also engage executive functions,
spatial navigation, and memory abilities. Over time, these linked
cognitive demands may have beneficial effects on brain structure
and function. In fact, recent studies have shown that highly fit
and competitive young adult athletes perform better on tests of
executive function and processing speed in non-sport specific
cognitive tasks, suggesting exercise-based improvements may be
generalizable to cognitive demands during daily life (Voss et al.,
2010b; Chaddock et al., 2011). For example, Chaddock et al.
(2011) showed that athletes perform better than non-athletes on
a virtual street-crossing task that requires multi-tasking while
walking. Perhaps the kinds of changes that occur in resting
state fcMRI of athletes demonstrated in our study supports this
type of high performance executive function during locomotion.
As such, it would be expected that the brain regions sub-
serving these cognitive functions may show enhanced patterns
of functional connectivity in response to frequent and sustained
endurance running activity.
Connectivity Patterns
We found two overarching patterns that distinguished the expert
endurance athletes from non-athletes. First, we found support
for enhanced connectivity between the FPN and regions that
have been associated with frontal mediated cognitive functions,
including aspects of working memory in the athlete group (see
Klingberg et al., 1997; du Boisgueheneuc et al., 2006). Since the
FPN is generally associated with executive function, including
planning of motor control (Vincent et al., 2008; Pammi et al.,
2012), it is possible that between-group connectivity differences
reflect, in part, executive function demands during endurance
running. Interestingly, improvements in this cognitive domain
are often associated with increased physical activity in older
adults, and the findings in older adults combined with our results
provide initial support for the hypothesis that aerobic exercise
enhances connectivity in brain regions linked to executive
functions across the lifespan (see Voss et al., 2010c).
Second, we found strong patterns of anti-correlations between
the DMN of athletes and brain regions often associated with
functions that may be especially stressed during endurance
running. These functions include motor control, somatosensory
needs which may be associated with foot strike during running,

and visual processing (Nolte, 2009), which may be needed for
planning foot placement and for navigation. In addition, in
athletes, a seed region in the MN was strongly anti-correlated
with the posterior cingulate, a key area of the DMN. The DMN
is a network highly engaged at rest, and enhanced cognitive
performance is associated with both DMN deactivation during
tasks, and with resting-state anti-correlations between the DMN
and task-positive networks (Gusnard and Raichle, 2001; Greicius
and Menon, 2004; Keller et al., 2015). The pattern of anti-
correlations found in the athlete group is consistent with the
hypothesis that DMN deactivation may enhance performance in
cognitive domains required of high-level endurance running.
In addition to these two key patterns, we found a significant
positive connectivity value between a seed region in the DMN and
a nearby subcortical region that included mainly WM. Previous
work has suggested that fMRI signals in WM should not occur
due to both relatively lower blood flow compared with gray
matter, and the possibility that fMRI signals occur in response
to post-synaptic signals in gray matter (see Logothetis et al.,
2001; Logothetis and Wandell, 2004). However, there is mounting
evidence that the vasculature in WM can lead to a measureable
BOLD fMRI signal, mainly during task-based activities (Maldjian
et al., 1999; Tettamanti et al., 2002; Weber et al., 2005; Mazerolle
et al., 2010; Gawryluk et al., 2014). Our results may be related
to greater WM vasculature density and blood flow in selective
frontal brain regions in endurance athletes compared with non-
athletes, allowing us to detect a relatively stronger WM signal
at rest. Supporting this hypothesis, recent work has shown that
exercise can increase vascular density in the brain (Bullitt et al.,
2009). Further study of highly athletic individuals is needed to
address the question of differences in WM signal with fcMRI
and to gain a better understanding of potential underlying
mechanisms.
Finally, we found two differences that suggest greater anti-
correlations in our non-athlete young adults than athletes.
Specifically, the non-athlete group had greater anti-correlations
between the left anterior seed in the FPN and an area near
the right superior frontal and supplementary motor regions,
areas often associated with motor control, and significant anti-
correlations between the DMN and a region in the vicinity of

the left paracentral region, while athletes did not show significant
connectivity values in either case. These findings may reflect
regional differences in the reliance on the FPN and DMN for
overt cognitive activity in the non-athletes compared to athletes.
Further research is needed to better understand the source of such
regional differences and how they are related to differences in
cognitive performance.
Overall,
functionally
connected
regions
found
in
this
study are consistent with the needs of athletes during high
intensity running. For example, high-speed running entails
the combination of complex, sequential motor tasks, multi-
tasking, working memory, and object recognition. We also
found evidence that patterns may be driven by time spent in
intense aerobic activity. In all of the patterns described above,
connectivity strength (both positive and negative) was highly
correlated with measures of aerobic fitness and self-reported
physical activity. Furthermore, these connectivity findings
were not influenced by the four left-handed participants in
our cohort, as there was no difference between the groups
in handedness and all relations to MET and physical activity
scores remained significant when the left-handers were removed
from the regression analyses (4.86E-5 ≤ p ≤ 0.038). Although
experimental interventions would be needed to infer causation,
these results do suggest that between-group differences in
fcMRI connectivity are related to inter-individual differences in
engagement in endurance exercise. Future work should focus
on longitudinal assessments of endurance exercise training and
resting state connectivity to determine the amount and type
of activity that most strongly impacts changes in functional
connectivity and their relation to changes in cognitive and motor
skill.
Possible Mechanisms for
Between-Group Connectivity Differences
Recent work suggests that connectivity strength reflects a history
of co-activation of functionally connected regions (see Lewis
et al., 2009; Raichle, 2011; Buckner et al., 2013; Keller and Just,
2016), and patterns of resting state connectivity may indicate a
history of task-dependent activity (see Duan et al., 2012). We
suggest that between-group differences in our study are likely due
to functionally covarying regions during endurance running that,
over time, lead to strengthened functional connections within
resting state networks and specific functional associations with
task related extra-network regions. Our observations showing
the association of correlation strength between brain regions and
time spent in physical activity provides some support for this
interpretation.
Over the short term, several studies have shown that learning
induces acute changes in resting state fcMRI (Keller and Just,
2016). For example, after a short (11 min) motor training
session, subjects showed strengthened connections in the FPN
compared with a control group (Albert et al., 2009). Woolley
et al. (2015) recently showed that one session of training on a
virtual water maze led to an increase in resting state functional
connectivity between the hippocampus and the dorsal caudate,
and the magnitude of the change in connectivity was correlated
with future task performance. Finally, recent work suggests
that training-induced changes in resting state fcMRI activity
are related to underlying structural effects that may provide a
window into how and why these networks impact cognitive
performance (Keller and Just, 2016). Using a virtual spatial
navigation training task, Keller and Just (2016) found that
one training session led to increased resting state connectivity
between the hippocampus and cortical areas that was associated
with changes in diffusivity in the hippocampus.
Longer-term training that stresses specific cognitive domains
may result in lasting and stable changes in resting state fcMRI,
a result that has been demonstrated by comparing individuals
considered experts in specific behaviors with healthy controls.
For example, Jang et al. (2011) examined differences in the DMN
of long-term practitioners of meditation compared to healthy
controls. They found increased functional connectivity in the
anterior medial prefrontal cortex of meditation subjects, an area
that is related to self-relevant mental simulation (Jang et al.,
2011). In chess grand masters, high levels of intrinsic functional
connectivity in the DMN were associated with greater levels of
DMN deactivation during cognitive tasks (Duan et al., 2012).
Expert musicians show several distinct differences in resting
state connectivity patterns compared with non-musicians (Fauvel
et al., 2014). These differences include enhanced connectivity
between clusters in the cingulate gyrus, the right prefrontal
cortex, and the left temporal pole (Fauvel et al., 2014). In
professional badminton players, a sport that requires complex
motor control, functional connectivity between frontal regions

and the left superior parietal region was altered compared with
healthy non-athlete controls (Di et al., 2012). Finally, a recent
study of world-class gymnasts also found effects of long-term
motor training on resting state functional connectivity (Wang
et al., 2016). Gymnasts had reduced connectivity within what
the authors term functional modules compared with controls
(the cerebellum, fronto-parietal, and cingulo-opercular regions),
which they attributed to enhanced neural efficiency in these areas
(Wang et al., 2016).
Taken together these studies suggest that, over time, co-
activation of brain areas can enhance functional networks at rest
and that the strength of resting state connectivity can reflect long-
term training in a variety of activities. Within the context of
our results, long-term training for endurance running may result
in co-activation of specific brain regions within and related to
networks associated with motor control and executive function.
Over time, expert athletes may develop enhanced connectivity
that may in turn lead to greater efficiency in performing the
implicit motor and cognitive tasks associated with long-distance
endurance running. Further research is needed to address this
question directly with sensitive measures of cognitive and motor
skills in both young and older adult athletes compared to non-
athlete controls.
CONCLUSION
Our results show, for the first time, clear differences in resting
state functional connectivity between expert endurance athletes
and healthy age-matched non-athletes. These differences may
arise in response to the cognitive demands of long distance
running combined with aerobic exercise. It is possible that
differences in resting state fcMRI activity may improve aerobic
athletic performance by allowing more efficient execution of
cognitive and motor demands during highly intense activity.
Given the correlation between cardiovascular fitness and exercise
participation variables and connectivity, it is possible that
an examination of elite athletes would reveal even greater
connectivity differences. This is an area that should be explored in
future work. In addition, the cognitive demands of high intensity
endurance exercise may also lead to differences in performance
on activities that are unrelated to sports. Previous work has in fact
identified greater performance on non-sport specific cognitive
tasks in competitive athletes (Voss et al., 2010b; Chaddock et al.,
2011). Future work should investigate resting state functional
connectivity as a predictor of both athletic performance in young
adults and cognitive performance on non-sport specific cognitive
tasks.
While we focused here on expert endurance athletes, most
studies of the effects of aerobic exercise on brain structure and
function include recreational athletes in their sample. Thus, a
limitation of our study is that we do not have a recreational
athlete group that would allow us to more clearly distinguish
the neural effects of expertise compared with general effects of
lower-level exercise participation. While we believe there is great
value in examining the extremes of athletic engagement (i.e.,
expert vs. sedentary), there is a need for future work to examine

resting state functional connectivity in recreational young adult
runners. These studies, combined with our data, will help us
fully understand the nature of the dose-response relationship
between aerobic activity and resting state connectivity and may
help us determine the level of athletic engagement needed to alter
functional networks. In addition, these types of studies will help
us identify whether sedentary behavior itself is a driver of some
of these changes in functional networks. It will also be important
for future studies to include larger samples with both men and
women, as well as expanded assessments of physical fitness,
lifestyle histories, and cognitive functions across the age-range
from young to older adults.
Finally, we believe that exercise-induced neuroplasticity in
young adults should be investigated in relation to brain
aging and the potential to reduce vulnerability to cognitive
aging and the risk for neurodegenerative disease. There is
growing evidence from retrospective studies that exercise at
younger ages can have protective effects on brain aging
(Rovio et al., 2005; Kulmala et al., 2014; Tolppanen et al.,
2014). In older adults, self-reported early adult and mid-
life exercise is correlated with enhanced global cognition
(Gill et al., 2015), memory (Richards et al., 2003), and
executive function (Sabia et al., 2009). Additionally, mid-life
physical activity has been associated with reduced risk of
developing neurodegenerative diseases (Rovio et al., 2005).
Enhanced connectivity may occur in response to cognitive
demands during exercise, yet the strengthened connections may
improve executive function more broadly, allowing for improved
cognitive function later in life. Lifelong physical activity may
be an important element of successful aging and strengthened
resting state connectivity could reflect a mechanism for the
protective effects of physical activity. Together, our findings
suggest that more detailed investigations of exercise-induced
neuroplasticity in young adults may help us better understand
how lifelong healthy behaviors can improve quality of life in older
adults.
