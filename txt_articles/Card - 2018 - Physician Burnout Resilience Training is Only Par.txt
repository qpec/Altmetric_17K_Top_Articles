Physician Burnout: Resilience Training is Only Part  
of the Solution
ABSTRACT
Physicians and physician trainees are among the highest-risk groups for burnout 
and suicide, and those in primary care are among the hardest hit. Many health 
systems have turned to resilience training as a solution, but there is an ongo-
ing debate about whether that is the right approach. This article distinguishes 
between unavoidable occupational suffering (inherent in the physician’s role) and 
avoidable occupational suffering (systems failures that can be prevented). Resil-
ience training may be helpful in addressing unavoidable suffering, but it is the 
wrong treatment for the organizational pathologies that lead to avoidable suffer-
ing—and may even compound the harm doctors experience. To address avoid-
able suffering, health systems would be better served by engaging doctors in the 
co-design of work systems that promote better mental health outcomes.

INTRODUCTION
P
hysicians and trainees are among the highest-risk groups for burn-
out and suicide,1,2 and those in primary care are among the hardest 
hit.3-5 In addition to the obvious harm this causes doctors, medical 
students, and their families, physician burnout can also lead to negative 
impacts on patients, staff, and health care organizations.4 Recognizing this, 
health systems around the world have promoted resilience training as a 
way to help physicians cope with the emotional demands of their work.
Resilience is defined as “stress coping ability” and “…the personal 
qualities that enable one to thrive in the face of adversity.”6,p.76 Training to 
strengthen these qualities is intended to help physicians avoid or recover 
from the affective, physical, and cognitive exhaustion and disengagement 
from work that constitute burnout.7
Given the inherently stressful nature of clinical work, it makes sense 
that improving individual resilience might help, but is it really the best 
answer? Recently, this approach has been called into question by those 
who say that poor working conditions and unreasonable expectations are 
to blame for physician burnout and suicide, not a lack of grit on the part 
of those who are harmed.8,9 The “con of individual resilience,” they argue, 
“is part of the problem.”9
As usual in such debates, the truth is probably to be found somewhere 
in between these 2 positions. So when does resilience training make sense, 
and when is it just a sham treatment that leaves the underlying pathology 
untreated?
Picking the Right Tool for the Job: Avoidable vs Unavoidable 
Suffering
Effective risk reduction interventions require a good match between the 
target of the intervention and the underlying causes and contributing fac-
tors that give rise to that risk.10 Resilience training is a viable solution if,

and only if, the underlying problems include a lack of 
individual resilience.
By borrowing a framework from the literature on 
patient suffering, we can readily assess the appropriate-
ness of resilience training as a treatment/prophylaxis 
for the occupational suffering of physicians. Specifi-
cally, we need to differentiate between unavoidable 
suffering and avoidable suffering.11,12
For patients, unavoidable suffering is an irreduc-
ible consequence of their condition or treatment, 
and avoidable suffering is the result of faulty care 
systems.11,12 So, for instance, reduced mobility during 
recovery from a major heart surgery would be the 
cause of unavoidable suffering, while unmanaged pain 
during the recovery—or receiving the wrong sur-
gery in the first place—would be causes of avoidable 
suffering.
The same categories can be used to assess occu-
pational suffering in health care. Certain sources of 
psychological stress are an inherent part of a physician’s 
job: not every patient can be healed; life or death deci-
sions will need to be made without enough information; 
some patients/families will assume that any adverse 
outcome is the result of a lapse in care, etc. These are 
sources of unavoidable suffering, and because they can-
not be prevented, the goal of health care organizations 
should be to minimize the harm they cause. Of course, 
they should ensure that there is no excess likelihood of 
such events, but they should also focus on mitigating 
the effects on doctors when they inevitably do occur. 
Resilience training makes perfect sense as part of a 
response to unavoidable suffering.
But other sources of suffering clearly are avoidable, 
such as overwork and understaffing, a hostile work 
environment, unsafe working conditions, and failure 
to provide the resources doctors need to provide safe 
care. For avoidable suffering, which by definition can 
be eliminated, the primary goal should be prevention, 
and interventions should focus on systems improve-
ment, not on individual resilience. And, while the best 
current evidence is limited, what we know about inter-
ventions to reduce burnout suggests that approaches 
targeting organizational improvements are more effec-
tive than those that focus on physicians themselves.13
Resilience training does nothing to solve the under-
lying causes of avoidable suffering, and may even cause 
harm: First, by giving the illusion of a simple solution, 
it may preempt the hard work required to address sys-
tems failures. And second, it may send the message to 
affected doctors that they are the problem, that they 
need to do better at “absorbing negative conditions,”8 
and that failure to “tough it out” is a sign of weakness.2 
This is an unethical abdication of duty on the part of 
health care managers.
There may be some small role for resilience training 
as a response to avoidable suffering if it is used as—and 
clearly communicated as—a stopgap measure to reduce 
harm while systems-focused improvements are put in 
place. But doing so without seeming to blame individual 
physicians for lack of grit would require a great deal 
of managerial deftness. A more potent and less fraught 
way to raise morale in such cases may be to engage 
doctors in the co-design of systemic improvements, 
allowing them to help diagnose and treat the organiza-
tional pathologies that are causing them harm.
Barriers
The routine working conditions for physicians and 
trainees would be considered unsafe, unprofessional, 
and even illegal in other safety-critical industries. But 
long tradition has made this appear acceptable to the 
medical community, and a whole host of rationaliza-
tions (economic, educational, etc) have been put for-
ward by both doctors and administrators to suggest 
that they are actually necessary.14 The truth, however, 
is that these working conditions can only be seen 
as acceptable and necessary if the health and well-
being of doctors (and the safety implications for their 
patients) are not a priority.
Why has the need for systemic solutions has been 
largely ignored in practice? As any good academic 
will tell you, more research is needed. But one key 
root cause is clear; both health care administrators 
and doctors themselves operate within a culture that 
pretends physicians are mythic beings who are, or at 
least should be, supernaturally resilient,2 infallible, and 
omnipotent.15
The cultural expectation is that “…‘good doctors’ 
do not complain, do not show pain, do not shirk work, 
and, above all, do not ever show signs or symptoms of 
mental illness, especially depression.”16,p.5 Those who 
seek help risk being seen as weak, and not up to the 
job.2 And the stigma of failing to live up to this impos-
sible image becomes yet another source of stress, “…
setting the stage for an individual’s downward spiral of 
suffering in silence and perpetuating the hidden cur-
riculum that has historically promoted ‘toughing it out’ 
and foregoing help.”16,p.1
This cultural dynamic is not limited to informal 
peer pressure. It is also codified in widespread regula-
tory requirements for mandatory reporting of mental 
health diagnoses among physicians—which can lead 
to loss of licensure.1,9 It is a small step from failing to 
acknowledge one’s own suffering to failing to acknowl-
edge the problems that cause that suffering. And it is 
very hard to solve a problem that no one will admit to.
In terms of administrators, the prioritization of 
physician well-being (or lack thereof) probably starts

at the top. Clinical experience is rare among hospi-
tal board members, and board members often lack 
confidence in their ability to affect improvement in 
clinically focused outcomes like quality of care. This 
lack of confidence in clinical affairs may be part of 
the reason why many boards focus more on financial 
governance and meeting external targets than on issues 
like quality and safety.17,18 Given the presence of a sep-
arate medical staff governance system, this “hands off” 
approach is likely to be even more pronounced when it 
comes to physician well-being. And this outlook natu-
rally trickles down to nonclinical administrators at all 
levels, because it defines what they are accountable for.
A very different cultural barrier is ingrained in the 
practice of health care safety and quality improvement: 
a preoccupation with training as the solution to almost 
any problem. This is by no means in line with the lit-
erature in the field, but is an almost universal feature of 
current practice.19
Training and other administrative controls (eg, 
signs, alerts, policies) offload responsibility for sys-
temic problems onto the shoulders of frontline work-
ers. Not only is this unfair and unsustainable, but it is 
also likely to be ineffective19 and sometimes counter-
productive.19-21 In recent years, a number of tools have 
been developed to help health care teams design stron-
ger improvement interventions,10,22-27 but practice has 
been slow to change. As a result, administrators who 
do try to take action on physician burnout may fixate 
on resilience training without ever considering more 
effective, systems-oriented solutions.
Solutions
In the longer term, it is vitally important to build an 
evidence base for improved practice in the prevention 
and mitigation of occupational suffering in health care, 
and to work toward building a culture that acknowl-
edges the essential humanity of physicians. But what 
can health care organizations do right now?
Burnout among physicians (and other health care 
workers) is the result of both avoidable and unavoid-
able suffering. It cannot be fixed through individual 
resilience training alone. Instead, health care organi-
zations should treat burnout like the key quality and 
safety issue it is. Solving basic problems like workflow 
and communication deficiencies may significantly 
improve physician well-being,28,29 and the use of 
scribes to support EHR documentation is a particu-
larly promising practice.29,30
Health care organizations should ensure that their 
governance and management systems maximize the 
participation of clinical staff in setting priorities and 
solving problems. They should also develop and track 
indicators of physician burnout (eg, the Maslach Burn-
out Inventory13 or the Oldenburg Burnout Inventory7) 
and important stressors that may lead to burnout, such 
as excessive work hours14; use of second victim sup-
port services31-33; the clerical burden imposed by EHR 
systems and workflow design29,34-36; the number, and 
signal-to-noise ratio, of EHR alerts36,37; psychological 
safety survey results38; teamwork quality39; etc.
While “zero occupational suffering” and even “zero 
burnout” are probably unachievable goals, health care 
administrators and physician leaders can use data 
sources like these to identify outbreaks of burnout 
and–better still–detect emerging risks before they 
cause harm. But identifying problems solves nothing 
by itself. Health care organizations also need to lever-
age the best available tools to design effective and sus-
tainable treatments for the underlying organizational 
pathologies they uncover.10,22-27
Hospitals, and increasingly, other health care 
organizations, already have systems improvement 
infrastructure in place to help investigate and address 
causes of adverse outcomes11; we simply have to make 
sure we are using those resources to protect clinicians 
as well as patients.
And yes, resilience training—as well as peer support 
and stigma-free mental health treatment—should be 
offered in parallel with these systems-focused efforts,1,2,8 
because some occupational suffering is truly unavoid-
able. But offering these interventions instead of serious, 
systemic improvement simply adds insult to injury. 
Resilience training is not our only hammer, and not 
every problem that leads to physician burnout is a nail.
