ABSTRACT The domestic dog (Canis lupus familiaris) is characterized by
greatly reduced parenting investment compared with the wild type wolf (C. l.
lupus) from which it is descended.
 Unlike wolf pups,
 which are reared by both
parents into their second year of life,
 dog pups are abandoned by their mother
at weaning around eight weeks of age.
 This relatively small parental involve-
ment may contribute to the high pup mortality observed in dogs not living as
pets.
 We hypothesized that people would find dog pups most attractive
around weaning age when conspecific parental care is significantly reduced
and pup mortality rate is high.
 Younger and older pups would benefit less from
human intervention because in the former case the mother is providing care,
and in the latter their survival is already compromised.
 To test this hypothesis,
51 participants rated the attractiveness of 39 black and white headshot pho-
tographs presented on a computer screen of dog pups from three breeds
(Jack Russell Terrier,
 Cane Corso,
 and White Shepherd),
 from birth to 7
months old.
 In line with our hypothesis,
 attractiveness of Cane Corsos peaked
at 6.
3 weeks of age;
 Jack Russell Terriers’ attractiveness peaked at 7.
7 weeks;
and White Shepherds were most attractive at 8.
3 weeks.
 There were also dif-
ferences in attractiveness between the breeds,
 with Cane Corsos rated less
attractive than the other two breeds.
 If this attractiveness motivates humans
to care for the dog pups and thereby improves pup survival,
 this could con-
fer significant advantages to dogs,
 and may contribute to our understanding
of the process of domestication.

Dogs were the first animal species domesticated,
 originating
from populations of wolves that adapted to human proximity
(Clutton-Brock,
 1999).
 The mechanism by which dogs evolved,
however,
 is still debated.
 Some authors have argued that the dog arose
as a response to a new symbiotic relationship that formed with the
❖

growing settled human populations at the end of the last ice age,
 thereby providing an
 
ecological niche with new evolutionary selective pressures (Coppinger & Coppinger,
 2001);
others have proposed that the physical and behavioral changes that led to the formation of
dogs were the outcome of human intervention and consequent artificial selection (Darwin,
1871;
 Derr,
 2013;
 Morey,
 1994;
 2012).
 At different points in the history of the dog,
 natural
 
selection in response to changing environments and human-determined artificial selection
both likely played roles (Larson et al.
,
 2011).
Regardless of the mechanism,
 the domestication of the dog resulted in diverse physio-
logical and behavioral changes,
 which have been characterized as a paedomorphism of
wolves (Morey,
 1994;
 2012).
 Compared to a wolf of the same weight,
 a domestic dog has a
head that is 20% smaller,
 as well as a smaller brain and teeth (Coppinger and Coppinger,
2001).
 Other changes that occurred during domestication are defined by Coppinger and Cop-
pinger (2001) as saltations:
 traits that appeared within a short time frame due to selection,
such as floppy ears and variety of coat colorings.
 
Some of the most striking behavioral differences between the dog and wolf are in repro-
ductive behavior (summarized in Lord,
 Feinstein,
 Smith,
 & Coppinger,
 2012).
 Wolves show
seasonality and reproduce once a year during a fall/
winter breeding season.
 In contrast,
 male
dogs are continuously sexually active;
 bitches only show a slight tendency toward seasonal-
ity (Pal,
 2003;
 Boitani & Ciucci,
 1995),
 and can return to estrus soon after giving birth (Lord et
al.
,
 2012).
 Wolves form long-term pair bonds,
 whereas dogs are typically promiscuous (Boi-
tani & Ciucci,
 1995;
 Pal,
 2005).
 Wolf parents cooperate in rearing their young:
 among dogs,
typically only mothers invest in raising young (Boitani & Ciucci,
 1995;
 Kleiman & Malcolm,
1981;
 though see Pal,
 2005,
 for some evidence of paternal investment,
 and Paul,
 Majumder,
& Bhadra,
 2014 for evidence of grand-maternal care).
 
Furthermore,
 wolf offspring stay with their parents for up to two years,
 receiving  
support
from other family members when first weaned,
 and usually remain with their parents to as-
sist in provisioning the young of at least one subsequent litter.
 Dog pups,
 conversely,
 are
abandoned by their mother at weaning (between 6–11 weeks;
 Malm & Jensen,
 1996;
 1997;
Pal,
 2005;
 2008;
 Paul,
 Majumder,
 & Bhadra,
 2014;
 Wilsson,
 1984).
 At first,
 dams start to
reduce time spent nursing around the fourth and fifth week of a pup’s life,
 both in captivity
(Malm & Jensen,
 1996;
 1997;
 Wilsson,
 1984) and in free-living (Pal,
 2008) individuals.
Weaning is usually complete around week eight in captive dogs (Malm & Jensen,
 1996;
1997;
 Wilsson,
 1984),
 and slightly later in free-living animals (10–11 weeks in India,
 Pal,
2005;
 2008).
 
Dogs’ low parental investment likely contributes to the high rate of pup mortality in pups
not in the care of humans.
 The lowest estimate of the rate of pup mortality for free-roaming
dogs is near 45%,
 estimated in Baltimore in 1971—though this was noted as an underesti-
mate due to the difficulty of locating very young dogs (Beck,
 1973).
 All other estimates are
over 80% mortality in the first year of life.
 For example,
 Pal (2001) reported 82% first-year mor-
tality in free-ranging urban dogs in Katwa,
 West Bengal,
 India.
 Boitani & Ciucci (1995) reported
95% first-year mortality in central Italy over a three-year period.
 Similarly,
 Macdonald and Carr
(1995) reported 84% mortality in just the first five months of life in central Italy.
 Daniels and
Bekoff (1989) estimated the survival rates to four months for the dogs in Cuidad Juarez,
  
Mexico
and Navajo reservation,
 Arizona,
 USA to be 66%.
 In New Providence,
 Bahamas,
 Fielding and
Plumridge (2005) reported 45% mortality to the first birthday of owned (though largely  
free-roaming) dogs.

 The limited post-weaning parental investment of dogs likely contributes to low pup survival
rates in free-ranging populations.
 Therefore,
 having humans adopt and care for pups around
weaning,
 could confer significant competitive advantages in survival.
 Human adoption prior to
weaning may not have strong advantages as the pups already have conspecific parental care
in place.
 Later human adoption would likely have little competitive advantage as most pups
die within the first months to year of life (e.
g.
,
 Macdonald & Carr,
 1995).
 Thus,
 dog pups are
most susceptible to death and most likely to gain significant benefits from human adoption at
weaning.
 We hypothesize that dog pup morphology is most attractive to humans at or near
the typical time of weaning.
 
Prior researchers have noted that adult dogs generally have paedomorphic features
compared with wolves (Morey,
 1994;
 2012),
 and have suggested this enhances humans’
attraction to the morphology of the dog.
 Lorenz (1943) was one of the first to propose that
humans tend to be attracted to individuals with more juvenile physical features.
 An
 
enlarged head with protruding forehead,
 large low-set eyes,
 a round face with bulging
cheeks,
 and a small mouth and nose are the main features of the “Kindchenschema”
 
(infant or baby schema),
 which is postulated to motivate a caregiving response in humans,
regardless of the species carrying these features (Lorenz,
 1943).
 Supporting Lorenz’s
 
hypothesis,
 Archer and Monton (2011) demonstrated that pictures of human infants,
 teddy
bears,
 dogs,
 and cats with more infantile features were rated as more attractive than those
that looked less infantile.
 Kindchenschema effects have even been noted in the evolution
of fictional characters toward a shape more like that of juvenile humans in Mickey Mouse
(Gould & Lewontin,
 1979),
 and teddy bears that evolved from having long snouts into
shorter snouted and larger round headed creatures (Hinde & Barden,
 1985;
 Morris,
 Reddy,
& Bunting,
 1995).
These prior studies,
 however,
 have assumed that infantile features are attractive,
 with-
out considering whether there might be an optimal age of attractiveness below which an
 
infant animal might appear less attractive.
 To test the hypothesis that humans may find dogs
most attractive at weaning (compared with younger or older dogs),
 pictures of the faces of
three breeds of dog at a range of ages chosen to cover the typical age of weaning were pre-
sented to adult human participants who rated them for attractiveness.
 The breeds were
chosen for the availability of series of photographs showing individuals in similar poses at a
dense set of ages,
 and for their diverse,
 but not explicitly paedomorphic,
 appearance in the
adult.
 The three dog breeds were Jack Russell Terrier,
 a small breed,
 originally used in fox
hunting,
 of a typically pale coloration with short hair;
 Cane Corso,
 a large,
 darker-colored,
originally guarding breed of dog;
 and White Shepherd,
 a large white,
 longer-haired,
 originally
sheep-herding dog.
Methods
Participants
The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Florida
 
(Approval # u-774-2013).
 Fifty-one students (28 men,
 23 women) were recruited through
the Department of Psychology Research participation pool.
 Their ages ranged between 18
and 35 years (M = 19.
24,
 SD = 2.
78).
 Participation was voluntary,
 a signed informed writ-
ten consent was obtained from all participants,
 and participation credit was awarded for
 
attending the study,
 regardless of whether it was completed.
 All participants completed
the study in its entirety.

 The images were presented singly on a computer screen and each participant
saw the images in one of four random orders.
 Figure 1 includes a sample of the photo-

 Each participant was asked to answer the question “How
attractive is this dog?” for each photograph by moving a slider to any spot between end
 
positions marked “not at all attractive” and “very attractive.

reported the spot chosen by the participant as a value between 0 and 100.
 A total of 1,
938
ratings was scored.
 
Procedure
Participants signed up online through the Department of Psychology Research Participation
Credit Manager.
 The study was located in a room at the Psychology building of the University
of Florida.
 On arrival,
 the participant reported his or her name,
 age,
 and gender,
 and received
an explanation of the study (but not its hypothesis) and written consent was obtained.
 Partic-
ipants were led singly to a computer and asked to read the instructions on the screen.
 The
 
experimenter sat at the side of the room while the participant completed the study.
 
Statistical Analyses
Linear mixed effects models were used to model rated attractiveness as a function of pup age
and breed using the lmer4 package in R (Bates,
 Maechler,
 Bolker,
 & Walker,
 2013).
 The
lmerTest package was used to calculate p-values for the parameter estimates using a
 
Satterthwaite’s correction for degrees of freedom (Kuznetsova,
 Brockhoff,
 & Christensen,
2013),
 and the car package (Fox & Weisberg,
 2011) was used to conduct Wald Chi-Square
tests to test the effects of variables with more than two groups.
 Bootstrapped estimates were

calculated using the boot package (Canty & Ripley,
 2014).
 Models were inspected for violations
of the assumptions of normality with q-
q plots and homoscedasticity with residual plots.
 
Resul
ts
Figure 2 shows the overall rating of attractiveness for each breed of dog as a function of age
in weeks.
 Attractiveness is low at birth,
 but then increases to a maximum before 10 weeks of
age and declines again before leveling off.
 Finally,
 there is a possible small increase in attrac-
tiveness at the oldest ages tested.
 A cubic mixed effects model was fit to model this observed
trend in the data.
 First,
 a cubic model that included all interactions with breed,
 age,
 and par-
ticipant gender was fit with random intercepts for each subject.
 A comparison between this
model and a model including random slopes across ages,
 indicated that a random intercepts
and slopes model was a better fit (�2 = 137.
24,
 df = 2,
 p < 0.
001).
 We then attempted to
 
reduce the fixed effects through model selection.
 Participant gender had no significant inter-
action with breed,
 age,
 or main effect on participant ratings (p > 0.
05),
 and was therefore
 
removed from the model.
 All remaining interaction terms were highly significant and could not
be reduced further,
 indicating that the cubic fit was the best-fitting model.
 Table 1 shows the
Wald �2 values for each model parameter of the final model.
 
Figure 2 includes the best-fit and 95% Confidence Interval (CI) for the model considering
fixed-effects only (grey shade).
 Overall,
 the shape of the curve for attractiveness varied as a
function of breed,
 as indicated by the significant breed by age interaction as shown in Table 1.
There was also a main effect of breed on attractiveness ratings (�2 = 234.
43,
 df = 2,
 
p < 0.
0001),
 where the Cane Corso was rated as the least attractive (see Figure 2).
To test the main hypothesis that dogs are likely to be most attractive at the age of wean-
ing,
 we calculated the 95% CI intervals for the maximum value of attractiveness as predicted
by the model for each breed.
 Bootstrapped confidence intervals were calculated from the
maximum value of attractiveness from 400 simulations for each breed.
 Cane Corsos showed
a maximum attractiveness at 6.
3 weeks of age (CI:
 4.
1–8.
2 weeks).
 Jack Russell Terriers
showed a similar age of maximum attractiveness:
 7.
7 weeks (CI:
 5.
7–9.
1 weeks),
 and White
Shepherds were most attractive at 8.
3 weeks (CI:
 7.
7–8.
9 weeks).
 
Discussion
These results support our hypothesis that the attractiveness of puppies’ faces from three dis-
tinct dog breeds does not decline monotonically with increasing age,
 but rather peaks around
the time of weaning (6 to 8 weeks post partum) and is lower in both older and younger dogs.

 This is consistent with the hypothesis that the Kindchenschema effect in dogs has an adap-
tive function—namely to solicit human adoption when the mother is removing her support and
the young show a very high level of mortality.
 
The benefits to dogs of being cared for by humans would appear self-evident,
 especially
once dams wean and abandon their young,
 but it should also be noted that Pal (2005),
 study-
ing reproduction and infant mortality in free-living dogs in an Indian town,
 noted that the  
single
largest cause of death in dogs in the first three months of life was their being removed as pets
by children.
 This human intervention was responsible for 27% of all recorded deaths of pups
in that age range.
 Nonetheless,
 it seems reasonable to suppose that human care of weaned
pups aids the dogs’ survival overall.
 
One prior study includes evidence that the Kindchenschema effect is not a monotoni-
cally increasing function of decreasing age of dog pup stimuli.
 Sanefuji,
 Ohgami,
 and Hashiya
(2007) asked adult human participants and children around five years of age to sort seven
photos each of human babies,
 a chimpanzee,
 rabbits,
 dogs,
 and cats of different ages
 
according to their cuteness.
 Trends in cuteness as a function of age were not apparent for
most of the species presented;
 however,
 dog pup cuteness clearly peaked at an interme-
diate age.
 The dog photographs were of the Shiba Inu breed at the ages of 0.
5,
 1.
0,
 1.
5,
2.
0,
 2.
5,
 and 3.
0 months.
 Sanefuji et al.
 (2007) found that dog pup cuteness peaked at 1
month for adult raters,
 and 1.
5 months for child raters.
 Both younger and older dogs were
rated as less cute.
 The data analysis provided by Sanefuji et al.
 (2007) does not permit
 
estimation of whether their age of peak attractiveness differs significantly from that obtained
here,
 but,
 given the age difference in the photos they used,
 their data appear approximately
consistent with our findings.
 
In addition to a significant effect of age on attractiveness for each dog breed,
 we also found
that the breeds differed in their attractiveness.
 The Cane Corso was rated as less attractive than
the other two breeds.
 This could be due to the darker color of the Cane Corso than the Jack
Russell Terrier or White Shepherd.
 Some studies report that darker dogs are adopted from
shelters slower than paler colored dogs:
 (Lepper,
 Kass,
 & Hart,
 2002;
 Posage,
 Bartlett,
 &
Thomas,
 1998;
 Wells & Hepper,
 1992);
 though this effect is not found at all shelters
 
(Protopopova,
 Gilmour,
 Weiss,
 Shen,
 & Wynne,
 2012).
 The Cane Corso might also be con-
sidered a more aggressive-looking breed than the other two tested here.
 Fighting breeds were
the slowest to be adopted in Protopopova et al.
 (2012).
 The lower attractiveness of the Cane
Corso may also be due to its larger size.
 Smaller dogs have been found in previous studies to
be rated more attractive and adopted more rapidly from shelters (Protopopova et al.
,
 2012).
Smaller stature can also accentuate the Kindchenschema because the eyes of smaller dogs
may appear bigger in respect to the face (Glocker et al.
,
 2009).
 
Several studies have investigated the structural dimensions that underlie human percep-
tion of the attractiveness of human and nonhuman young.
 Glocker et al.
 (2009) observed
that manipulated images of human infants high in Kindchenschema were perceived as cuter
and more likely to elicit care-giving in manipulated photo-realistic stimuli.
 Little (2012) manip-
ulated photographs of human and cat faces to look more or less infantile.
 He reported that
human infant and cat faces were rated more attractive than adult human faces,
 and faces
 
manipulated to look more infantile were rated more attractive in both species.
Baby-like facial traits in older children and adults can also be perceived as more likeable
and attractive (Luo,
 Li,
 & Lee,
 2011).
 Hecht & Horowitz (2015) systemically manipulated 14
 
attributes in photographs of dogs’ faces and found that human observers preferred some
Chersini et al.
315

features associated with Kindchenschema,
 as well as human-like qualities such as colored
irises and an upturned (smile-like) turn to the mouth.
One limitation of the present study is that only three breeds were deployed.
 Hundreds of
dog breeds are recognized by breed clubs around the world and they display great phenotypic
variation.
 This variability also extends to their appearance at different stages of development,
making it possible that age at peak attractiveness to humans may vary considerably.
 Further,
we did not ask about participants’ familiarity with the breeds chosen,
 which may have had
 
potential effects on their ratings.
A second limitation of the present study is that participants were invited to rate still pho-
tographs of the dog pups.
 Ratings of video—or even live viewing of the pups—could have
produced different results due to the attractiveness of the animal’s patterns of movement.
 
Although most discussions of the Kindchenschema hypothesis have focused on the cuteness
of static animal faces,
 Lorenz did mention “clumsy movements” as part of the Gestalt of
 
Kindchenschema (Lorenz,
 1943).
 In life,
 if there is an adaptive function to the process of
 
interspecies attractiveness of juvenile individuals,
 it must be revealed in ecologically realistic
viewing of live individuals.
 One study that considered attractiveness of a live pup found that
attractiveness measured as the approach of strangers to a person holding a pup,
 decreased
with increasing pup age.
 However,
 the youngest pups tested in that study were already 73
days (10.
5 weeks) old (Fridlund & Macdonald,
 1998).
A third limitation to this study is that the participants were young-adult university students.
Different populations of human observers might show different patterns of attractedness to dog
pups of different ages.
The present results indicate that these three breeds are rated most attractive around wean-
ing.
 Any possible adaptive explanation of this cross-species attraction must remain highly
speculative,
 but the possibility that dogs and humans may have co-evolved so that dogs are
most attractive to people just at the point where human intervention would have the most
positive impact on pup survival may contribute to developing an understanding of the mech-
anisms of domestication.
 Future research could extend these findings to other breeds,
 to the
perception of live pups,
 and also investigate the structural components,
 such as relative size
of different facial components,
 underlying the preferences found here.
In conclusion,
 in three breeds of dogs,
 pups were found to be most attractive to human
raters around weaning age,
 which is a time of high mortality for dog pups.
 This attraction of
humans to dog pups at that phase of life may have given early dogs,
 and may continue to give
today’s free-living dogs,
 a competitive advantage by being adopted and cared for by humans
as conspecific care decreases.
