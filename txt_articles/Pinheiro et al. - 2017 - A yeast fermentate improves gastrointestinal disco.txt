Abstract
Background: Constipation and symptoms of gastrointestinal discomfort such as bloating are common among
otherwise healthy individuals, but with significant impact on quality of life. Despite the recognized contribution of
the gut microbiome to this pathology, little is known about which group(s) of microorganism(s) are playing a role.
A previous study performed in vitro suggests that EpiCor® fermentate has prebiotic-like properties, being able to
favorably modulate the composition of the gut microbiome. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the
effects of EpiCor fermentate in a population with symptoms of gastrointestinal discomfort and reduced bowel
movements and to evaluate its effect at the level of the gut microbiome.
Methods: This pilot study was performed according to a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel design.
Eighty subjects with symptoms of gastrointestinal discomfort and constipation were allocated to one of two trial arms
(placebo or EpiCor fermentate). Randomization was done in a stratified manner according to symptom severity,
resulting in two subgroups of patients: severe and moderate. Daily records of gastrointestinal symptoms were
assessed on a 5-point scale, and also stool frequency and consistency were documented during a 2-week run-in
and a 6-week intervention phases. Averages over two-week intervals were calculated. Constipation-associated
quality of life and general perceived stress were assessed at baseline and after 3 and 6 weeks of intervention.
Fecal samples were also collected at these same time points.

Results: EpiCor fermentate led to a significant improvement of symptoms such as bloating/distension (p = 0.033 and
p = 0.024 after 2 and 4 weeks of intervention, respectively), feeling of fullness (p = 0.004 and p = 0.023 after 2 and
4 weeks of intervention, respectively) and general daily scores (p = 0.046 after 2 weeks of intervention) in the moderate
subgroup. A significant improvement in stool consistency was observed for the total population (p = 0.023 after
2 weeks of intervention) as well as for the severe subgroup (p = 0.046 after 2 weeks of intervention), and a nearly
significant increase in stool frequency was detected for the total cohort (p = 0.083 and p = 0.090 after 2 and 4 weeks of
intervention, respectively). These effects were accompanied by an improvement in constipation-associated quality of
life and general perceived stress, particularly in the moderate subgroup. Members of the families Bacteroidaceae and
Prevotellaceae, two groups of bacteria that have been previously reported to be deficient in constipated patients, were
found to increase with EpiCor fermentate in the severe subgroup. In the moderate subgroup, a significant increase in
Akkermansia muciniphila was observed.
Conclusions: Despite the relatively low dose administered (500 mg/day), particularly when comparing to the high
recommended doses for prebiotic fibers, EpiCor fermentate was able to modulate the composition of the gut
microbiome, resulting in improvement of constipation-associated symptoms. Conversely, the reported increase in
bowel movements may have altered the gut microbial community by increasing those groups of bacteria that are
better adapted to a faster gastrointestinal transit time.

Background
Functional constipation, also known as chronic idiopathic
constipation (CIC), is a symptom-based gastrointestinal
(GI) disorder without apparent organic abnormalities that
occurs in otherwise healthy individuals [1]. However, con-
stipation is a common complaint in clinical practice, and
its prevalence ranges between 5% and 20% in the general
population [2, 3], thereby representing a significant health
care burden [4, 5]. In 2012, it was estimated to account for
3.2 million visits to medical centers in the United States
[4, 5], with annual treatment costs of $1912–$7522 per
patient [6]. In addition to economic costs, constipation
greatly affects patients’ quality of life, having a significant
impact on both mental and physical components [7, 8].
The efficacy of pro- and prebiotics in functional constipa-
tion has been recently reviewed, and it has been concluded
that, in general, there is insufficient evidence to recom-
mend probiotics for functional constipation, as considered
trials are few, heterogeneous and poorly designed [9].
Although the evidence that prebiotic fibers (e.g. psyllium
and inulin) have a positive effect on constipation is more
substantial, and thus recommendations for their intake are
stronger, the quality of evidence is still considered low.
Many reasons may account for this, such as poor study
design, heterogeneity of administered doses and duration
of treatment [9]. However, it is our conviction that the
inherent difficulties in studying constipation, due to a lack
of objective markers (e.g. blood parameters), and the
recognized placebo effect commonly observed throughout
GI disorder trials are playing a major role [1, 10–13].
In most instances, it is challenging to show beneficial
gut health effects within a target population of healthy
individuals [14]. Therefore, most, if not all trials enrol
specific patient groups in gut-health studies. In many
examples, these relate to patients suffering from Irritable
bowel syndrome (IBS) as defined by the Rome III
criteria. IBS is a functional GI disorder characterized by
chronic or recurrent abdominal pain or discomfort,
mostly associated with defecation abnormalities (consti-
pation alternating with diarrhea episodes) in the absence
of a detectable organic or pathological cause. However,
abdominal pain or discomfort occur both in healthy
subjects and IBS patients, with frequency and/or severity
of symptoms usually higher in IBS patients. Therefore,
the Rome III diagnostic criteria distinguishes IBS from
functional constipation, the latter being usually diag-
nosed after careful examination of patients’ history and
in the absence of clear physiological abnormalities [1].
Despite some controversy [15], primary constipation
(i.e., unrelated to medication use and/or neurological or
systemic illness) is deemed idiopathic (unknown cause)
and there are no specific markers that support diagnosis.
Hence, patients’ history is the most determinant factor
for correct diagnosis.
EpiCor, a dried fermentate made using yeast (Saccharo-
myces cerevisiae), while neither a probiotic nor a prebiotic
fiber, has been shown to have immune-modulating prop-
erties in both human clinical trials [16–18] and in vitro
[19–21]. Furthermore, a recent study using in vitro gut
models has shown that EpiCor fermentate is selectively
Pinheiro et al. BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine  (2017) 17:441 
Page 2 of 20
 fermented by the intestinal microbiota in the colon,
resulting in beneficial modulation of the intestinal
microbiota and luminal environment [21]. The combin-
ation of these findings suggests that repeated intake of
EpiCor fermentate can positively affect the intestinal
environment in humans, thereby enhancing digestive
comfort and ultimately contribute to improved immunity.
Interestingly, the use of the Simulator of the Human
Intestinal Microbial Ecosystem (SHIME®) has shown that
EpiCor fermentate has prebiotic potential by increasing
butyrate levels in the simulated colon and by stimulating
Lactobacilli growth [21]. Butyrate, one of the main end-
products from carbohydrate fermentation by the gut
microbiota, is the main energy source for colonocytes, has
recognized immunomodulatory activities and anti-cancer
effects (reviewed in [22]). The Lactobacillus genus is also
recognized as containing several health-enhancing species.
Altogether, these results obtained in vitro indicate that
long-term administration of EpiCor fermentate (up to
4 weeks) is able to modulate the intestinal environment
and alter gut microbial composition, thereby suggesting
an important prebiotic-like effect [21]. Importantly, there
is evidence that GI motility and gut microbiota are clearly
associated [23]. Experiments performed in humanized
germ-free mice suggest that gut microbes modulate bowel
movements, and changes in GI motility also modify the
resident microbial population [24]. In addition, microbial
metabolites, particularly short-chain fatty acids (SCFA),
including butyrate, are also recognized as being essential
for optimal ileal and colonic motor activity [23, 25].
Although most evidences have been obtained using
animal models, the role of butyrate in altering GI
transit is well described [26]. In addition, some stud-
ies have shown that altered microbiome composition
is a common trait of both functional constipation and
constipation-predominant IBS (C-IBS) [27–31].
Taking this collective body of evidence into account,
we hypothesized that EpiCor fermentate, as a result of
its prebiotic-like effect, may help improve bowel func-
tion and generally contribute to enhanced gut health.
Therefore, this pilot study was intended to assess the
effect of 6-week administration of EpiCor fermentate on
GI symptoms and stool frequency/consistency in a
population with moderate to severe symptoms of intes-
tinal discomfort, and to determine if EpiCor treatment
could
lead
to
an
improvement
in
quality
of
life.
Additionally, fecal samples were collected at pre-defined
intervals in order to investigate associated changes in
gut microbiome composition.
Methods
Study design
This exploratory study conformed to a mono-center,
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel
design. Human male/female volunteers with moderate to
severe symptoms of GI discomfort and constipation
were screened for eligibility (Fig. 1). Eligible subjects, i.e.,
meeting the different inclusion and exclusion criteria
(Table 1), were enrolled in a 2-week run-in phase so to
provide baseline measurements of GI discomfort and
stool frequency and consistency. The 2-week averages
obtained for the GI symptoms diary were also used as
an additional inclusion criteria in order to allocate the
subjects to one of two subgroups according to the
randomization scheme (see further below).
This study was designed so that results would comply
with all European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) require-
ments for scientific results that substantiate statements
for ingredient efficacy.
According to EFSA, claims
related to the GI tract fall within the scope of ‘Function
claims’ and ‘Claims on gastrointestinal discomfort’
, and
the recommendations for gut health studies are to use
specific patient groups as study group, such as IBS and
functional constipation. In agreement with the guide-
lines, GI discomfort may be measured by using validated
subjective global symptom questionnaires [32]. Validated
‘quality of life questionnaires’ are also considered to
provide supportive evidence for claims on GI discom-
fort. Therefore, we have made use of previously vali-
dated questionnaires in order to investigate the effects
on symptoms of GI dysfunction, stool frequency/
consistency and constipation-associated quality of life
[14, 33] (see further below).
Participants
Eighty healthy male/female volunteers between 18 and
70 years of age with reduced bowel movements and
other symptoms of GI discomfort were enrolled via pub-
lic notice board and phone call. All included participants
finished the trial. Participants’ enrolment and study
execution took place between July 2015 and January
2016 at the Drug Research Unit Ghent (D.R.U.G.)
located at the Ghent University Hospital (Belgium), an
independent study site performing clinical trials. The
study was sponsored and coordinated by ProDigest
BVBA (Belgium) and commissioned by Embria Health
Sciences (USA). Before inclusion in the study, partici-
pants were medically examined for their physical health
conditions and were assessed for the fulfillment of all
inclusion and exclusion criteria (Table 1).
Study product
EpiCor fermentate is the brand name for a substance
consisting of a dried yeast fermentate made using
Saccharomyces cerevisiae (produced by Embria Health
Sciences, LLC, of Ankeny, Iowa, USA). It consists of
various metabolites, including polyphenols, polysaccha-
rides such as beta glucan, trace minerals, amino acids,
Pinheiro et al. BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine  (2017) 17:441

 and peptides. Within the USA, EpiCor fermentate has
successfully completed the New Dietary Ingredient
Notification process with the US Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) and has been determined to be a
Generally Recognized as Safe ingredient by an inde-
pendent panel of safety experts. Table 2 shows the
nutritional information for bulk dried fermentate.
So far, all published human studies on EpiCor fermentate
have used a daily dose of 500 mg for adults [16–18, 34].
Moreover, this is the commercially recommended daily
dosage, and so was also the dose used here. The placebo
used in this study was Globe maltodextrin 10 (CPIngre-
dientes, Mexico). This commercially available product is a
mixture of dextrose, maltose, oligo and polysaccharides
obtained by partial enzymatic hydrolysis of corn starch.
Maltodextrin is the most commonly used placebo in
dietary studies evaluating gut microbiota and intestinal
well-being. It is easily digested and rapidly absorbed as
glucose and has no anticipated effect on colonic fermenta-
tion. Both products were provided in capsules. The cap-
sules were Coni-Snap®, two-piece hard gelatin capsules
(Capsugel, Mexico). Blinding was ensured by the fact that

evening the average severity over the previous 24 h on a 5-point scale from 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely) for the following 5 GI characteristics:

 both capsules were opaque and had an identical appear-
ance and were packed in identical bottles by Embria
Health Sciences and were labeled as ‘A’ or ‘B’ before
shipment to ProDigest. A ProDigest staff member not
participating in study design, sample processing or data
analysis, randomized the participants, labeled all bottles
and assigned them to each subject in accordance to the
randomization list. In this manner the corresponding
product was not known by either the sponsor members
managing the study or the D.R.U.G. unit.
Randomization scheme
As mentioned above, an additional inclusion criterion
was defined after run-in phase in order to distinguish
those subjects that have more severe symptoms from
those who report to have more moderate symptoms. To
do this, the daily questionnaires completed during the
2-week run-in phase were analyzed at the end of this
period. This allowed us to obtain a more accurate evalu-
ation of the effective GI symptoms perceived by the par-
ticipants, as opposed to the single assessment performed
during enrolment. To ensure that sufficient individuals
with higher (severe) GI symptoms’ scores would be
included, the threshold for successful inclusion in the
study was set to have at least 50 subjects reporting an
average score ≥ 5 for GI discomfort based on the 5-item
GI symptoms questionnaire (see further below) which
was recorded daily during run-in. The remaining 30
subjects did not have to meet this additional criterion.
To ensure that within the two subgroups (severe and
moderate) there would be an even number of subjects
allocated to both trial arms (EpiCor fermentate or
placebo), randomization was stratified [35] for symptom
severity as follows: after screening and subsequent inclu-
sion, each subject was assigned a unique subject identi-
fier. Subjects were randomly assigned to one of the two
testing conditions: 1) placebo (500 mg/day, single serving,
maltodextrin) or 2) EpiCor fermentate (500 mg/day, single
serving). In total, 80 subjects completed the study (40 -
subjects in each trial arm). The randomization scheme

 was generated by using the Web site Randomization.com
(http://randomization.com). Randomization was done by
using a permutated block design (blocks of 2, 4 and 6) in a
stratified manner in order to allocate an even number of
individuals from both trial arms to both subgroups. For
that, two randomization lists were generated: one for
those subjects (minimum 50) that met the additional
inclusion criterion after run-in phase (GI symptoms aver-
age score ≥5) – here designated severe subgroup (subjects
received a unique identifier number). A second list was
generated for the remaining subjects who did not meet
this after run-in inclusion criterion (GI symptoms <5) –
here designated moderate subgroup (subjects received a
unique identifier number non-overlapping with the severe
list). The individual identifiers were used to prepare labels
so to assign to each subject the bottles containing either
EpiCor or placebo according to the randomization scheme
(‘A’ or ‘B’) for the entire study.
After receiving the GI symptoms diary recorded
during run-in, an average total score was calculated for
the two-week period and the subjects allocated to the
corresponding randomization list. At the end of the
study, the number of subjects within the severe subgroup
was 55 and within the moderate subgroup 25 (Fig. 1).
After randomization, a baseline visit was scheduled and
samples were collected for baseline parameters (visit 1)
(Fig. 2). Subjects were also asked to fill in the question-
naires Patient Assessment of Constipation Quality of Life
(PAC-QOL) and Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) (see further
below) in order to assess their baseline symptoms for each
questionnaire. They have also received the corresponding
testing product (either EpiCor or placebo) and initiated
the 6-week intervention trial (500 mg/day, single dose).
Two more visits were scheduled: after 3 and 6 weeks
(visits 2 and 3, respectively). At each visit, fecal samples
were collected and questionnaires filled in. Throughout
the entire study, the subjects also filled in a diary, where
they could record daily their GI symptoms, stool fre-
quency and stool consistency (Fig. 2). The baseline instru-
ment for the intervention diary was the run-in diary that
was used for allocation. The randomization scheme was
done by a ProDigest staff member not involved in the
study. All participants, principal investigators and staff
members involved in the study at both D.R.U.G. and Pro-
Digest sites were blinded. Unblinding only occurred after
completion of data analysis. The key for identifying the
products in case of adverse events was kept sealed in an
envelope at D.R.U.G. and ProDigest until unblinding. No
adverse events were recorded.
Primary objective
The primary objective of this pilot study was to study
the effect of long-term administration of EpiCor on
digestive comfort and constipation-associated quality of
life. To assess this, the volunteers were asked to docu-
ment daily (during the 2-week run-in phase and 6-week
intervention phase) their GI symptoms as well as the
frequency and consistency of their stools. For assessment

 of GI symptoms, the volunteers were asked to grade
daily in the evening the average severity over the previ-
ous 24 h on a 5-point scale from 0 (absent) to 4 (very
severe) the following five items: Bloating/Distension,
Passage of gas, GI Rumbling, Feeling of fullness and
Abdominal discomfort (this instrument has been de-
scribed and used by Buchwald-Werner and colleagues
(2014) in a similar study [14]). A Daily Total Score
(DTS)
was
also calculated
by
summing all
items
recorded each day. A lower score is concomitant with
lower
severity
of
symptoms.
Stool
frequency
and
consistency were also recorded daily by using the
Bristol Stool Form Scale [36]. This comprises seven
types of stool: type 1 (separate hard lumps); type 2
(sausage shape lumpy); type 3 (sausage with cracks);
type 4 (sausage but soft and smooth); type 5 (soft lobs);
type 6 (fluffy and mushy) and type 7 (liquid). Types 1, 2
and 3 are associated with hard or impacted stools
(linked with dysbacteriosis and chronic constipation);
types 4 and 5 are considered normal or optimal; type 6
is considered subnormal or suboptimal and type 7 is
associated with diarrhea. Both instruments were subject
to a 2-week period evaluation: average of weeks 1 and 2
of run-in (=T1; baseline); average of weeks 1 and 2 of
intervention (=T2); average of weeks 3 and 4 of interven-
tion (=T3) and average of weeks 5 and 6 of intervention
(=T4). The GI symptoms diary reported during run-in was
also used as an instrument to allocate subjects to the cor-
responding subgroups and according to the randomization
list (EpiCor severe and EpiCor moderate, placebo severe
and placebo moderate) (see Figs. 1 and 2).
Constipation-associated quality of life was evaluated
by using the Patient Assessment of Constipation Quality
of Life (PAC-QOL) questionnaire [33] (Janssen Global
Services, LLC, USA; MAPI Research Trust, France),
which has been validated in a patient population with
history of chronic constipation. The PAC-QOL provides
information about the special distraction of daily life and
general well-being of volunteers because of constipation
[37]. Volunteers were asked to fill in this questionnaire
retrospectively at baseline, middle and end of interven-
tion (visits 1, 2 and 3, respectively) (Fig. 2). The PAC-
QOL questionnaire is a 28-item self-reporting instru-
ment divided in four domains: Physical Discomfort,
Psychosocial Discomfort, Worries and Concerns and
Satisfaction. A 5-point scale from 0 (none of the time) to
4 (all of the time) was used to assess the severity of the
different symptoms. A final Instrument Total Score
(ITS) was also used by calculating the mean of the 28
items at each visit. A lower score is concomitant with a
better quality of life.
It is known that psychosocial factors, such as daily
stress may alter gut physiology leading to ileum contrac-
tions and consequently to GI discomfort [38]. Therefore,
subjects were asked to scale their stress levels in the
Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) questionnaire [39]. This is
the most widely used psychological instrument for meas-
uring the perception of stress (not constipation related)
[39]. Volunteers were asked to fill in this questionnaire
retrospectively at the same days as for PAC-QOL. The
PSS is a 10-item self-reporting instrument with a 5-point
scale from 0 (never) to 4 (very often). A final Instrument
Total Score (ITS) was calculated by summing all items re-
corded at each visit. A lower score is concomitant with
lower stress. Although the first intent was to rule out the
role of stress from the study, the results obtained with this
instrument paralleled the ones obtained for the PAC-
QOL.
Thus,
despite
the
obligation
of
not
altering
objectives after data analysis, given the fact that improve-
ment of quality of life and decrease in stress levels are
somewhat related, it is our conviction that these instru-
ments can be regarded as being complementary.
Secondary objective
Given established links between constipation and gut
microbiome dysbiosis [23, 24, 27–31, 40], the secondary
objective of this study was to assess the effect of EpiCor
fermentate on gut microbial composition. For that,
subjects were asked to collect fecal samples at visits 1
(baseline), 2 and 3 (3 and 6 weeks after intervention,
respectively) (Fig. 2). Participants were also instructed to
store the sample container in the freezer until delivery.
Total DNA was extracted using the Fast-Prep24 instru-
ment (MP-Biologicals), as previously described [41].
Briefly, 100 mg of fecal sample were resuspended in
Tris/HCl (100 mM, pH 8.0) supplemented with 100 mM
Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), 100 mM sodium
chloride (NaCl), 1% (w/v) polyvinylpyrrolidone and 2%
(wt/vol) sodium dodecyl Sulphate (SDS) and mechanically
disrupted. Bacterial cells were lysed in a Fast Prep-24 in-
strument (40 s., 6.0 m/s.). Samples were then centrifuged
at 20,800 g for 5 min and the supernatant washed with
one volume phenol/chloroform/isoamylalcohol (25:24:1),
followed by another centrifugation step. Then, the aque-
ous phase was washed with one volume chloroform. After
centrifugation, nucleic acids (aqueous phase) were precipi-
tated with one volume of ice-cold isopropanol and 1:10
volume of 3.0 M sodium acetate. The DNA was resus-
pended in 100 μl sterile TE-buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl,
1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0). Before proceeding with PCR ampli-
fication, a cleaning step was performed with the OneStep™
PCR Inhibitor Removal Kit (Zymo Research, USA). DNA
quality and quantity were analyzed by electrophoresis on a
1.2% (w/v) agarose gel and by determination of the
absorbance at 260 and 280 nm. Assessment of qualitative
changes in the general microbiota structure and profiles
were done by Illumina® sequencing, a technique involving
the amplification of a hypervariable region (V5-V6 region

Page 7 of 20
 of the 16S ribosomal RNA) of bacterial DNA and sequen-
cing of the amplified region. This region was amplified
using previously reported primers [42].
Statistical analysis
For the primary objectives (diaries and questionnaires), a
linear mixed model analysis was used to determine the
longitudinal effects of intervention. This model corrects
for baseline differences and includes all patients, even
those who drop out during intervention (note however
that there were no dropouts). Group, time and group-
by-time were included as fixed factors. An unstructured
covariance structure for repeated measures was consid-
ered. As a result, random effects were redundant. No
multiple imputation method was required, since group
and time did not have any missing data and a likelihood-
based approach for missing outcome data was used. All
analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics for
Windows (Version 23.0, Armonk, NY, USA). The esti-
mated effects (differences between EpiCor fermentate
and placebo) ± 95% 2-sided confidence interval (CI)
were plotted in forest plots. Differences between EpiCor
fermentate and placebo for the total cohort as well as
for both subgroups (severe and moderate) were calcu-
lated separately. In addition, statistical significant differ-
ences ‘within’ groups were calculated by using one-way
repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) in
GraphPad Prism (v7.00 for Windows, GraphPad Soft-
ware, La Jolla California USA, www.graphpad.com). A
p-value ≤0.05 was considered statistically significant,
although nearly significant p-values (p < 0.1) are also
indicated if deemed relevant.
Concerning the Illumina® sequencing data (secondary
objective), the V5-V6 region of the 16S rRNA gene was
amplified using previously reported primers [42]. Libraries
were prepared by pooling equimolar ratios of amplicons,
using 200 ng of each sample, tagged with a unique
barcode [43]. Resulting libraries were sequenced on a
MiSeq (Illumina, Hayward, CA, USA) paired and joined,
but only forward reads were selected for the final analysis
(140 nucleotides). A quality filter program that runs a
sliding window of 10% of the read length, and calculates
the local average score based on the Phred quality score of
the FASTQ file, was used to trim the 3′-ends of the reads
that fell below a quality score of 10. Reads with an N char-
acter in their sequence, mismatches within the primers
and barcodes or more than 8 homopolymers stretches
were discarded. Following primer sequences trimming, se-
quences were separated based on their barcodes. The
number of representative phylotypes was generated using
the Uclust algorithm on USEARCH [44] by clustering at
97% similarity (1 mismatch), with a confidence level of at
least 80, with Cyanobacteria, Eukaryota, and Archaea line-
ages removed. Filtered database contained only phylotypes
present in at least: 1) one sample at an abundance higher
than 1%, 2) in 2% of samples at a relative abundance above
0.1%, and 3) in 5% of the samples at any abundance level
[43]. Sequence composition was compared using the RDP
Classifier tool [45] and SILVA database [46]. Based on
Pareto-Lorenz evenness curves [47] adapted for microbial
diversity [48], which plot species cumulative abundance, a
selection of the 400 most abundant operational taxonomic
units (OTUs) was done so to obtain a representative over-
view of microbial community changes. Relative abun-
dances of these OTUs were further processed at phylum,
family and genus levels. In total, these 400 OTUs were
classified into 6 phyla, 30 families and 58 annotated gen-
era. To evaluate differences across time within the two
treatment groups at both family and genus level, two-way
repeated measures ANOVA with Dunnett’s multiple com-
parison’s test against V1 was performed in GraphPad
Prism (v7.00 for Windows). A p-value ≤0.05 was consid-
ered statistically significant, although nearly significant
p-values (p < 0.1) are also indicated. Boxplots were also
done in GraphPad Prism according to the Tukey method.
Data analysis was performed for the total cohort and the
two subgroups (severe and moderate) separately. To high-
light those taxa that mostly explain the differences
between placebo and EpiCor fermentate treatments, a joint
principal component analysis (PCA) / correlation biplot
was performed by using the relative fold-changes (V2/V1
and V3/V1) calculated for all three cohorts with the help
of Analyse-it for Microsoft Excel 4.51 software. This
explorative method allows analyzing the association
between variables (depicted as vectors) and observations
(depicted as points) by projecting them into the same
two-dimensional space. Logarithmic (Log2) transformed
fold-changes were also imputed into MeV 4.9.0 (Multiex-
periment Viewer) software so to perform a hierarchical
clustering (HCL) analysis in the form of heatmaps [49].
The K-means clustering (KMC) method was used by
setting the number of clusters to one and performing
10,000 iterations. A Pearson correlation distance metric
was used to build the hierarchical clustered tree. Both
taxa and observations were clustered. The resulting
heatmap showed approximately the presence of 7 major
clusters. This study report conforms to the CONSORT
2010 guidelines.
Results
The distribution of patients per trial arm and within
each subgroup is depicted in Table 3. In all groups, the
age range of participants was approximately between 20
and 69 years, and the median around 50 years of age. As
it is known that women suffer more from gastrointes-
tinal discomfort and constipation [14, 50, 51], more
women than men were included in this study. Because
randomization was stratified for symptom severity, an

 even number of subjects was allocated to either treat-
ment arm within each subgroup. This also ensured that
there were no substantial differences in GI symptoms
daily total scores (DTS) at baseline between EpiCor
fermentate and placebo within each subgroup (severe
and moderate) (Table 3).
Primary objective
Two-week-interval averages obtained
from the daily
reported GI symptoms were calculated: average of weeks
1 and 2 of run-in (=T1; baseline); average of weeks 1 and
2 of intervention (=T2); average of weeks 3 and 4 of
intervention (=T3) and average of weeks 5 and 6 of inter-
vention (=T4) (Additional file: 1). A one-way repeated
measures ANOVA was used to estimate if changes over
time were significant within each treatment group. In this
study, a noticeable placebo effect was observed for many
endpoints, a result which is not unexpected for gut
health-related trials [1, 10–13] (Additional file: 1). The
placebo effect was particularly evident in the severe
subgroup. In this subgroup no significant differences
between EpiCor fermentate and placebo were found (see
also Fig. 3). However, ‘between groups’ analysis clearly
showed that EpiCor fermentate had significant positive
effects on bloating/distension (p = 0.033 and p = 0.024
after 2 and 4 weeks of treatment, respectively), feeling of
fullness (p = 0.004 and p = 0.023 after 2 and 4 weeks of
treatment, respectively) and general GI discomfort (as
evaluated from the daily total scores; p = 0.046 after
2 weeks of treatment) on those subjects reporting milder
symptoms (moderate subgroup) (Fig. 3). Despite the
placebo effect noticed on GI symptoms, a nearly signifi-
cant improvement on stool frequency (p = 0.083 and
p = 0.090 after 2 and 4 weeks of treatment, respectively)
and a significant improvement on stool consistency
(p = 0.023 after 2 weeks of treatment) was observed for
the EpiCor-treated total cohort (Fig. 4). The averages
calculated for all time points and the statistical significant
differences ‘within groups’ over time can be seen in
Additional file: 2. Here it is also evident that a significant
improvement of stool consistency is observed over time in
the EpiCor-treated total cohort (p = 0.037) as opposed to
placebo (p = 0.535). This is also observed within the
severe (EpiCor, p = 0.044; placebo, p = 0.424) and moder-
ate (EpiCor, p = 0.031; placebo, p = 0.425) subgroups.
Finally, the impact of constipation on quality of life and
general perceived stress have been assessed (Additional
file: 3 and Fig. 5). For the PAC-QOL instrument, a
pronounced placebo effect was also noted, as subjects
reported an improvement in their quality of life in both
treatment groups (Additional file: 3). However, again, the
moderate subgroup was less affected by this placebo
effect, and a significant improvement of items such as
physical discomfort (p = 0.017), psychosocial discomfort
(p = 0.027) and satisfaction (p = 0.013) was reported
within the EpiCor-treated group, as opposed to the
placebo group (p = 0.435, p = 0.129 and p = 0.166, for
physical discomfort, psychosocial discomfort and satisfac-
tion, respectively) (Additional file: 3). In spite of the fact
that the differences between EpiCor fermentate and
placebo did not reach significance, it is clear a tendency
for improvement in the EpiCor-treated group in items
such as physical discomfort (which reached nearly signifi-
cant levels on the total cohort and moderate subgroup) and
satisfaction (Fig. 5a). Regarding general stress levels (PSS
instrument) a significant decrease in stress levels over time
was reported within the EpiCor-treated group (p = 0.016
and p = 0.044 for the total cohort and severe subgroup,
respectively) in contrast to the placebo-treated group
(p = 0.846 and p = 0.555 for the total cohort and severe
subgroup, respectively) (Additional file: 3). The differences
‘between groups’ were also quite pronounced, despite lack
of significance (Fig. 5b). Here, a nearly significant reduction
in stress levels was observed for EpiCor-treated total cohort
(p = 0.094) and moderate subgroup (p = 0.070).
Secondary objective
From literature it is clear that constipation is associated
with a dysbiotic gut microbial community [23, 24, 27–
31, 40]. Thus, in order to investigate whether EpiCor

 consumption altered the gut microbial composition,
fecal samples were collected at visits 1 (baseline), 2 and
3. DNA was extracted and the hypervariable region (V5-
V6) of the bacterial 16S was amplified and sequenced.
From the approximately 100,000 OTUs obtained upon
sequencing, 400 were selected based on their relative
abundance (Additional file: 4). Based on a Pareto-Lorenz
curve [47] adapted for microbial biodiversity [48], which
describes the unequal distribution of bacterial species
among the entire data set, this subset of OTUs was
found to account for more than 90% of the relative
abundance, and so was the one chosen to be used for
further analysis.
Within the gut, bacteria can be classified into one of
six phyla: Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Pro-
teobacteria, Verrucomicrobia and Spirochaetae, with the
first four being the most dominant. At first glance, the
relative abundance of these phyla does not seem to sub-
stantially change over time within the three cohorts
(total, severe and moderate) (Additional file: 5). How-
ever, after a careful look at the two most abundant phyla,
Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes, it is clear that within the
EpiCor-treated group the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes (F/B)
ratio decreases over time, whereas in the placebo-treated
group the F/B ratio increases (Fig. 6a and a*). This finding
was mainly due to changes seen in the severe subgroup
(Fig. 6b and b*) and was not observed within the moderate
subgroup (Fig. 6c and c*). This suggests that within the
severe subgroup, the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes
is increasing after EpiCor fermentate consumption, in
contrast to the placebo-treated severe subgroup. However,
at phylum level, changes are usually mild, unless in the
presence of a serious bowel-related disease, and are also
generally less informative. Therefore, in order to better
understand, within each phyla, which are the main groups
of bacteria changing over time after placebo and EpiCor
fermentate consumption, the fold-changes (relatively to
baseline) were calculated for each bacterial taxonomic
level (family and genus) (Additional files: 6, 7 and 8). It
must stressed that although subjects were asked not to
drastically alter their dietary habits throughout the study,
diet was not monitored, and so it is difficult to account for
diet-induced biases. Moreover, subjects enrolling in a
study investigating the effects of dietary supplements may
alter their dietary habits even if in an unconscious manner,
which may confound results and lead to placebo effects.
This could explain the fact that also within the placebo-
treated group statistical significant differences were found

symptoms are BD (bloating/distension), GAS (passage of gas), RUM (GI rumbling), FF (feeling of fullness) and AD (abdominal discomfort). A daily
total score (DTS) calculated as the sum of all items recorded each day is also shown. A linear mixed model analysis that takes into account the
differences between groups at baseline was used (p-values <0.05 are depicted in bold text; p-values <0.1 are depicted in regular text)

 for some taxonomic groups. To better evaluate which taxa
are contributing to discriminate placebo from EpiCor
within the three cohorts, a joint PCA / Correlation biplot
was done (Figs. 7 and 8). The most obvious observation is
the fact that the first component separates the placebo-
treated groups from the EpiCor-treated groups (Fig. 7).
The variables that mostly contribute to this separation are
indicated in the correlation plot in bold text (Fig. 8). For
example, some groups of bacteria are increasing upon
EpiCor intake (at least in one of the cohorts), thereby con-
tributing to Placebo vs. EpiCor differentiation in the first
component. The groups showing the highest weight (as
highlighted by longer vectors) are for instance the families
Porphyromonadaceae, Lactobacillaceae and Prevotellaceae
and the genera Barnesiella, Prevotella and Akkermansia
(Fig. 8). The second important observation is that the total
cohort is positioned between the severe and moderate
subgroups, a fact that supports subgroup analysis. The
subjects allocated to either subgroup were not only report-
ing different degrees of GI symptoms (Table 3), but were
also found to differ in their microbial community compos-
ition at baseline, clearly indicating a higher degree of gut
microbial dysbiosis for the severe subgroup (results not
shown). Interestingly, after hierarchical clustering (HCL)
analysis, it became apparent that time is also an important
factor playing a role (Fig. 9). The EpiCor-treated groups
cluster together per visit rather than per subgroup, thus
suggesting relatively similar changes in microbial compos-
ition at visit 2 and visit 3. This analysis also revealed the
presence of seven major clusters (C1-C7) with similar
expression that somewhat overlap the results of the PCA/
Correlation plot. For instance, in general, taxa belonging
to the clusters C3 and C7 show an increase in the EpiCor-
treated groups, whereas in the placebo there is a decrease
or no change (e.g. Propionibacterium, Paraprevotella and
Oscillibacter within C3 and Barnesiella, Prevotella and
Akkermansia within C7). The relative increase in Bacteroi-
detes observed within the severe subgroup (Fig. 6) seems
to be mainly attributed to an increase in members of the
families Bacteroidaceae, Porphyromonadaceae and Prevo-
tellaceae, with significant increases for the genera Bacter-
oides (p = 0.015 and p = 0.027 at V2 and V3, respectively)
and Prevotella (p = 0.039 at V2) (Additional file: 7). Des-
pite a lack of significance, a noticeable relative increase
was also observed for the genera Barnesiella and Odori-
bacter (family Porphyromonadaceae) within the severe
subgroup that received EpiCor. The relative decrease in
Firmicutes is mostly apparent in cluster C2 (Fig. 9), as
most members of this cluster (15 out of 24) belong to
this phylum and, in general, they are decreasing upon
EpiCor fermentate intake. Nevertheless, Anaerostipes
(phylum Firmicutes) is significantly increasing in the
EpiCor-treated group (p = 0.001 and p = 0.003 at V2
and V3, respectively) (Additional file: 7). Within the

 moderate subgroup changes are somewhat less evident,
which may reflect the lower number of subjects included.
Notably, however, within the moderate subgroup there is
a significant relative increase of Akkermansia muciniphila
(p = 0.0001 and p = 0.036 at V2 and V3, respectively), and
a significant relative decrease in Blautia (p = 0.023 and
p = 0.001 at V2 and V3, respectively) and Roseburia
(p = 0.002 at V2), effects that were not observed within
the severe subgroup (Additional files: 7 and 8).
Discussion
The aim of this pilot study was to investigate the effect
of EpiCor fermentate on GI discomfort by treating a
population with symptoms of constipation and compare
it to placebo in a parallel study. Because functional con-
stipation is usually diagnosed based on patients’ history
and therefore prone to being subjective [1], this study
defined clear inclusion criteria. Therefore, patients were
only included if they have reported (based on self-
assessment using a validated questionnaire over the pre-
vious 3 months) GI symptoms of at least 5 points [14],
or reduced bowel movements defined as an average > 1
and ≤5 stools per week. Following initial inclusion, sub-
jects initiated a run-in phase, after which an additional
inclusion criterion was established: at least 50 subjects
should report an average score ≥ 5 for GI discomfort
calculated based on the 5-item GI symptoms diary filled
in during the 2-week run-in. This allowed us to recruit
individuals that actually suffered from constipation, and
to stratify the study population into two subgroups: one
larger group with marked symptoms of GI discomfort
(severe subgroup, n = 55) and a second group having
milder symptoms (moderate subgroup, n = 25). This also
allowed us to investigate treatment efficacy on two sub-
groups of patients suffering from different degrees of GI
discomfort, as it is possible that efficacy differs according
to symptom severity [10, 13].
The two subgroups of patients were shown to differ in
terms
of
symptom
severity,
stool
frequency
and
consistency and quality of life parameters at baseline,
with the severe subgroup reporting more severe symp-
toms of GI discomfort (Table 3), fewer bowel move-
ments and poorer quality of life, as expected (results not
shown). In addition, they were also found to possess a
more dysbiotic gut microbial community when com-
pared to the moderate subgroup (results not shown).
Similar results have been found by others both in the
adult population [27, 30] and in children suffering from
constipation [28, 29, 31, 40]. These and our results
therefore suggest that constipation is associated with a
dysfunctional gut microbiome, and evidences support
that gut motility can be managed by intervening at the

 level of the gut microbial community [24, 52, 53]. Import-
antly, others have shown that relief of constipation by
synthetic laxatives such as Bisacodyl tend to normalize
and restore gut microbial composition, thus suggesting
that dysbiosis is secondary, rather than a cause of
constipation [30].
Improvement of symptoms
The generally accepted outcomes for trials on functional
gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs), such as functional
constipation, are those that reflect the patient’s symp-
toms that are relevant to the disorder and/or have an
impact on quality of life [13]. Therefore, we have made
use of validated instruments to assess the effects of
EpiCor fermentate on GI discomfort, bowel movements
and quality of life [14, 33, 36, 37, 39].
For that reason, the primary objective of this pilot study
was to assess the effect of long-term administration of
EpiCor fermentate on bowel function and gastrointestinal
well-being by means of validated questionnaires. Despite a
clear placebo effect within the severe subgroup, in the
moderate subgroup EpiCor fermentate had a positive
effect over time on five out of six GI symptoms domains.
In the moderate subgroup significant effects compared to
placebo were reached for bloating/distention, feeling of
fullness and daily total score (Fig. 3). The underlying rea-
son behind the strong placebo effect within the severe
subgroup can only be speculated, but it is known that pla-
cebo response on FGIDs trials is particularly high, making

 it rather difficult to show superiority of a new treatment
over placebo [10–13]. In that respect, individuals experi-
encing symptoms that are more pronounced may be more
prone to subjective feelings of improvement, irrespective
of the physiological effect of the treatment. This is com-
monly referred to as ‘regression to mean’
, i.e., subjects
experiencing severe intestinal discomfort will inevitably
improve [10]. Interestingly, placebo effects were less
pronounced for stool parameters. Stool frequency is an
objective parameter, and visual scoring of consistency is to
some extent more objective, particularly when true
changes occur (e.g. from hard to normal stools). Therefore,
an increase in stool frequency was observed for the
EpiCor-treated groups, and this effect was nearly significant
in the total cohort, whereas stool consistency improved
significantly in the total population and in the severe
subgroup, within the first 2 weeks of treatment (Fig. 4).
The impact of constipation on quality of life is pertinent
and comparable to that caused by serious chronic condi-
tions such as osteoarthritis and diabetes [54]. Therefore,
quality of life parameters are valid assessments to consider
in these type of studies [10, 13]. PAC-QOL, which focuses
on the effects of constipation on quality of life, showed
better results for EpiCor fermentate. Although not reach-
ing significance, ‘between’ groups’ analysis has shown that
all domains of this instrument improve in the EpiCor-

 treated moderate subgroup when compared to placebo,
and a nearly significant effect was detected for physical
discomfort (Fig. 5a). This suggests that an improvement of
GI comfort and bowel movements has a direct impact on
patient’s quality of life. The improvement reported for
physical discomfort may be related to the improvement
observed for bloating/distension, feeling of fullness and
stool frequency, as an increase in bowel movements may
result in a less bloated/full feeling, which in turn can lead
to the perception that physical discomfort improves. In
theory, disease-specific quality of life questionnaires, which
evaluate problems specific to the FGIDs in question, can
detect smaller and more relevant changes in health status,
which are otherwise missed by generic instruments [10].
Nevertheless, the generic perceived stress instrument used
in this study has also shown a positive improvement in
general stress scores within the total cohort and moderate
subgroup, particularly at the end of the study (Fig. 5b).

associated [23]. Experiments performed in humanized

 germ-free mice suggest that, on the one hand, gut
microbes modulate bowel movements and, on the other
hand, changes in GI motility modify the resident micro-
bial population [24]. The ecological principles of r/K
selection have been proposed to explain this: as GI tran-
sit time decreases (e.g. during diarrhea) species that are
better adapted to grow rapidly during reduced competi-
tion (r-selected) will dominate. In contrast, as GI transit
time increases (as during constipation) the community
will be dominated by species that grow more slowly in
unrestricted conditions but that are better adapted to
persist in a competitive environment (K-selected) [24].
Because the microbiome is metabolically interconnected,
direct effects of motility on key groups of bacteria may
result in a cascade of events with broader consequences
to the equilibrium of this ecosystem. Upstream of this
interplay between gut microbiome and GI transit is diet,
and dietary habits influence GI transit in a microbiota
dependent- and independent-manner [24]. For example,
the bulk effect attributed to fibers is well recognized,
and is behind the reason why an increase in fiber intake
is recommended by practitioners to ameliorate constipa-
tion. Obviously, fiber consumption and intake of over-
the-counter laxatives or antidiarrheals will influence GI
transit time. In turn, as mentioned above, GI transit time
has a selective role on microbiome composition. Inter-
estingly, both cellulose (poorly fermented by the gut
microbiota) and polyethylene glycol (PEG), the most
widely used compound in a number of commercial
laxatives, were shown to accelerate GI transit time in
humanized-mice with a concomitant increase in Bacter-
oidales and Bacteroidaceae [24]. In contrast, treatment
with loperamide (Imodium®, antidiarrheal) was shown to
delay transit time with the consequent increase in
Porphyromonadaceae [24]. These studies suggest that
these families of bacteria have different adaptation
mechanisms that distinctively influence their success
relatively to gut transit [24]. In addition, fibers or other
dietary supplements with prebiotic-like characteristics
modulate the gut microbiome and, depending on the
type of substrate, will offer nutritional advantage to
certain groups of bacteria that are able to degrade it. In
consequence, this will lead to the production of metabo-
lites, such as SCFA, that are known to regulate GI transit
[25, 55]. Moreover, the gut microbiota is also able to
directly modulate endocrine cells in the gastrointestinal
mucosa to produce molecules that influence gut motor
function, such as gastrin, serotonin (in [24]) and the
satiety hormones Peptide YY (PYY) and Glucagon-like
peptide (GLP)-1 (reviewed in [56, 57]).
Despite the recognized role of the gut microbiome in a
disorder as common as constipation, very little is known
about either quantitative or qualitative changes of bac-
teria in this condition [53]. Several reasons may account
for this [28, 53]: 1) lack of in-depth studies using for
example sequencing technology. Some studies have been
done by using either quantitative (q)PCR or conven-
tional culture-based techniques, which offer very limited
insight to the extended differences between constipated
and healthy individuals; 2) the use of different tech-
niques may influence outcome, and so direct compari-
son between studies is not straightforward; 3) microbial
analysis is typically performed in fecal samples, however,
the community present in feces may substantially differ
from mucosa-associated microbiota; 4) constipation is a
heterogeneous condition, subject to large interindividual
symptomatology. The existence of subgroups of patients
exhibiting different microbial signatures has been hypothe-
sized; 5) gut microbiome composition is largely individual-
dependent and so, if only minor changes in particular
species are to be expected in constipation, these may be
masked by a high interindividual variability; 6) gut micro-
biome composition and constipation are largely affected by
diet, and so regional differences are also to be expected,
which may hamper direct comparison between studies; 7)
studies have been done in a limited number of individuals,
which under-powers statistical tests, and 8) a general lack
of attention has been given to the role of the gut micro-
biome in constipation. Most studies have been performed
in IBS patients, which may or not suffer from constipation.
However, and despite some controversy [58], they are
different diseases in etiology and extrapolation has to
be done cautiously.
Nevertheless, constipation is a common condition in
infants and so has deserved some attention in the past
few years. In a study using conventional culturing tech-
niques, Zoppi and colleagues [40] have reported higher
numbers of Clostridium and Bifidobacterium species
among children with constipation. Similarly to these
findings, in another study using a PCR-based profiling
method, a higher relative abundance of bifidobacteria,
particularly Bifidobacterium longum, has been observed
in constipated children [28]. However, a recent study
using 16 s RNA pyrosequencing has found a lower abun-
dance of Bacteroidetes (mostly Prevotella species) in
constipated obese children, whereas several families and
genera belonging to the phylum Firmicutes were higher
[31]. In adults, reports are even scarcer. In a study per-
formed in 57 adult patients suffering from constipation
and using conventional culturing techniques, abundance
of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus was found to be
significantly lower in constipated subjects [30]. Similarly to
these findings, in a study examining the gut microbiome
of constipation-predominant IBS patients (C-IBS), both
Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus numbers were found to
be lower in C-IBS when compared to healthy subjects. In
addition, the numbers of butyrate-producing Roseburia/
Eubacterium rectale group were also significantly lower in
Pinheiro et al. BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine  (2017) 17:441 
Page 16 of 20
 these patients [27]. However, in a recent study investigating
the effect of a probiotic treatment in patients with
functional constipation, Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides
species were found to be significantly less abundant in con-
stipated patients, whereas the proportion of Lactobacillus,
Escherichia coli and Clostridium remained unchanged [59].
It is clear that there is a discrepancy between studies, and
most of them have been done using limited techniques.
Therefore, an in-depth study showing the differences
between gut microbiome composition of healthy and con-
stipated individuals is still lacking.
In the present study we have found that EpiCor treat-
ment increases the relative numbers of Bacteroidetes
(allied to a decrease in F/B ratio), particularly in the severe
subgroup (Fig. 6), and this seems to be due to an increase
in members of Bacteroidaceae, Porphyromonadaceae and
Prevotellaceae, namely Bacteroides, Barnesiella&Odori-
bacter and Prevotella, respectively (Additional file: 7).
Interestingly, a lower incidence of Prevotella species has
been hypothesized to be associated with a low-fiber diet
and insufficient plant-based foods consumption [60, 61],
and so to be a major cause of dysbiosis in the gut of
constipated patients [31]. Therefore, an increase in their
numbers by means of probiotic-like supplements has been
proposed for the management of constipation [31]. A
similar result has been reported in C-IBS patients. Rajilić-
Stojanović and colleagues (2011) have found that C-IBS
patients have a 2-fold increased ratio of Firmicutes to Bac-
teroidetes when compared to healthy individuals. This
deficit in Bacteroidetes numbers was related to a
lower incidence of members of the order Bacteroi-
dales, including Allistipes, Bacteroides, Odoribacter,
Parabacteroides and Prevotella [62]. In addition, anti-
diarrheal treatment of humanized germ-free mice also
led to an increase in the Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes
ratio, and treatment with PEG (laxative) and cellulose
increased the relative numbers of Bacteroidaceae [24].
Altogether, these and our results suggest that delayed
GI transit is associated with decreased Bacteroidetes
numbers
(and
concomitant
increase
in
F/B
ratio)
whereas acceleration of GI transit increases the rela-
tive numbers of Bacteroidetes, namely of members of
the Bacteroidaceae and Prevotellaceae groups. There-
fore, the results here obtained at the level of the gut
microbiome, i.e., a significant increase in Bacteroides
and Prevotella species may explain the positive effects
on stool frequency and consistency observed for the
EpiCor-treated groups, particularly for the severe sub-
group (Fig. 4). Nevertheless, and in contrast with the
results
obtained
using
humanized
germ-free
mice
[24], here we have found an increase in Porphyromo-
nadaceae upon EpiCor intake, thus stressing the com-
plexity
of
the
ecological
equilibrium
of
the
gut
microbiome and the difficulties in comparing studies
using different models and techniques. Also interestingly,
some of these changes were less pronounced or absent in
the moderate subgroup, while others seem to be specific
for this cohort (Additional file: 8). For instance, a signifi-
cant increase in Akkermansia muciniphila was observed
within the moderate subgroup. This important mucin
degrader, that resides in the intestinal mucus layer, has
been shown to be important for proper gut functioning
and to inversely correlate with metabolic disorders [63]. In
addition, we have found that the relative abundance of
Blautia and Roseburia significantly decreased in the
moderate subgroup, and these two groups of bacteria have
also been described to be higher in IBS and C-IBS patients
[62]. Moreover, Blautia numbers are positively and
strongly associated with IBS symptoms scores and so a
decrease in their numbers may be considered beneficial in
the context of IBS [62]. However, whether these changes
correlate with improved GI symptoms such as bloating,
which were reported by the moderate subgroup (Fig. 3), is
not known and demands further research. In contrast,
some groups are only increasing within the severe
subgroup, such as Anaerostipes, a genus containing
acetate-
and
lactate-consuming,
butyrate-producing
bacteria, with recognized health-enhancing effects [64]
(Additional file: 7). Once more these results support
subgroup analysis and suggest that patients experien-
cing different gradations of GI discomfort may actually
have also different levels of dysbiosis, and this ultim-
ately may advocate for a differentiated treatment.
Management of constipation can be complex and may
require multimodal therapy that follows a step-down
approach [54]. One of the first recommendations by
physicians is to accelerate colonic transit by adequate
fiber intake or use of bulk-forming agents. These will
retain water in the stools allowing them to pass more
easily. When such approaches are ineffective, the use of
hyperosmotic agents such as glycerin or sorbitol and stim-
ulants such as senna or bisacodyl must be considered [54],
but these have undesirable side effects and mustn’t be used
for prolonged periods of time. Therefore, some new
and less harmful approaches have been suggested [54],
such as administration of probiotics [65], but due to a
lack of properly controlled trials recommendation is
still poor [54].
It is not totally clear what may be the mechanism
behind EpiCor’s beneficial effect on constipation, but a
prebiotic-like effect cannot be discarded. The findings
that the gut microbiome of constipated patients is dys-
biotic and the reported in vitro positive effects of EpiCor
on gut luminal environment and microbial composition
[21] suggest that EpiCor could have a favorable effect on
constipation through modulation of the gut microbial
community, by increasing the numbers of beneficial
bacterial groups. This same in vitro study has also
Pinheiro et al. BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine  (2017) 17:441 
Page 17 of 20
 shown that EpiCor fermentation results in an increase in
butyrate levels [21], and butyrate has been described as
essential for optimal ileal and colonic motor activity
[23, 25, 26]. Therefore, the positive effects of EpiCor on
constipation could be mediated by an increase in butyrate
production, but this demands further research. Hence, it
is possible that the changes in microbial composition
observed in this study are, as previously reported, second-
ary to constipation [30]. In this manner, EpiCor intake, by
increasing bowel movements (by for example increasing
butyrate levels or other metabolites), would result in
changes in the composition of the gut microbial commu-
nity in an indirect manner.
Conclusions
Despite its low daily dose (500 mg/day), this study sug-
gests that EpiCor fermentate has a positive effect on GI
symptoms and stool parameters in individuals with
symptoms of gastrointestinal discomfort and reduced
bowel movements. Improvement of these symptoms was
nicely correlated with improved quality of life and
reduced stress levels. Moreover, EpiCor fermentate led
to changes in gut microbial composition that parallel
observations done by others in constipated and C-IBS
patients. Naturally, conclusions based on a single study
and with subgroup analysis are to be treated with cau-
tion, and it is formally recommended to obtain final
proof in a second confirmatory trial in order to substan-
tiate a health claim on ‘gastrointestinal discomfort’.
