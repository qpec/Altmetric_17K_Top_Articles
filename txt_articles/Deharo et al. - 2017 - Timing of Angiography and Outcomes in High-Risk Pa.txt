BACKGROUND: In patients with non–ST-segment–elevation myocardial 
infarction (NSTEMI) and GRACE (Global Registry of Acute Coronary 
Events) score >140, coronary angiography (CAG) is recommended by 
European and American guidelines within 24 hours. We sought to study 
the association of very early (ie, ≤12 hours), early (12–24 hours), and 
delayed (>24 hours) CAG in patients with NSTEMI with GRACE score 
>140 with ischemic outcomes.
METHODS: The TAO trial (Treatment of Acute Coronary Syndrome With 
Otamixaban) randomized patients with NSTEMI and CAG scheduled 
within 72 hours to heparin plus eptifibatide versus otamixaban. In this 
post hoc analysis, patients with a GRACE score >140 were categorized 
into 3 groups according to timing of CAG from admission (<12, ≥12–<24, 
and ≥24 hours). The primary ischemic outcome was the composite of all-
cause death and myocardial infarction within 180 days of randomization.
RESULTS: CAG was performed in 4071 patients (<12 hours, n=1648 
[40.5%]; 12–24 hours, n=1420 [34.9%]; ≥24 hours, n=1003 [24.6%]). 
With CAG ≥24 hours as a reference, CAG from 12 to 24 hours was not 
associated with a lower risk of primary ischemic outcome at 180 days 
(odds ratio, 0.96; 95% confidence interval, 0.75–1.23), whereas CAG 
<12 hours was associated with a lower risk of death and myocardial 
infarction (odds ratio, 0.71; 95% confidence interval, 0.55–0.91). 
Performing CAG <12 hours was also associated with a lower risk of death 
and myocardial infarction (odds ratio, 0.76; 95% confidence interval, 
0.61–0.94; P=0.01) compared with CAG performed at 12 to 24 hours. No 
difference was observed in bleeding complications.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with high-risk NSTEMI, undergoing CAG 
within the initial 12 hours after admission (as opposed to later, either 
12–24 or ≥24 hours) was associated with lower risk of ischemic outcomes 
at 180 days.

C
oronary angiography (CAG) plays a central role 
in the management of patients presenting with 
non–ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarc-
tion (NSTEMI), allowing confirmation of diagnosis and 
risk stratification and affecting the choice of revascu-
larization strategy and antithrombotic therapy. How-
ever, the optimal timing of CAG in these patients is 
still a matter of debate. CAG followed if indicated by 
coronary revascularization is recommended for most 
patients within the first 72 hours of hospital admis-
sion.1,2 This strategy has led to a reduction of mortality, 
recurrent ischemic complications, and length of stay 
compared with a strategy of selective angiography.3,4 
It has also been shown that an early invasive strategy 
(ie, within the first 24 hours) was associated with a 
further reduction in ischemic events (death, myocar-
dial infarction [MI], and refractory angina) in high-risk 
patients (defined by GRACE [Global Registry of Acute 
Coronary Events] score >140) but not in low-risk pa-
tients (GRACE score ≤140) and is recommended in 
both American and European guidelines.1,2,5 In those 
patients with high-risk NSTEMI, the interest in further 
reducing the delay to an invasive strategy is uncer-
tain. A series of small randomized trials have explored 
a strategy of “immediate” percutaneous coronary 
intervention (PCI) on hospital admission for patients 
with moderate- to high-risk NSTEMI and have yielded 
conflicting results.6–9 Instead of immediate PCI, which 
has challenging logistical implications (extending the 
burden of urgent angioplasty to patients who may 
not need it), it may be interesting to examine whether 
performing angiography with a view to intervention 
within a slightly wider time window (ie, the first 12 
hours after admission, which allows the scheduling of 
most patients during the daytime, regardless of their 
time of admission) would be associated with improved 
outcomes.
Using the large contemporary cohort of patients 
with NSTEMI extracted from the TAO randomized trial 
(Treatment of Acute Coronary Syndrome With Ota-
mixaban), we assessed in this post hoc analysis the 
association between a very early invasive strategy (ie, 
within 12 hours after admission) and clinical outcomes 
in patients with high-risk NSTEMI (defined by a GRACE 
risk score >140).
METHODS
Study Population
The methods and results of the TAO trial have been previ-
ously described.10,11 Briefly, TAO was a large international trial 
randomizing patients with moderate- to high-risk NSTEMI 
with CAG planned in the first 72 hours to heparin plus eptifi-
batide versus otamixaban. Patients were randomized to the 
unfractionated heparin plus eptifibatide group or to 1 of 2 
otamixaban dosing groups (intravenous bolus of 0.080 mg/kg 
followed by an infusion of either 0.100 or 0.140 mg/kg per 
hour) in a 1:1:1 ratio. A planned interim analysis performed 
after 1969 randomized patients in each group led the inves-
tigators to define the higher-dose otamixaban as optimal, to 
discontinue enrollment in the lower dose, and to continue 
enrollment in the higher dose until study end in a 1:1 ratio 
compared with heparin.
Patients with NSTEMI scheduled to undergo an invasive 
strategy (angiography and PCI, if indicated, to be performed 
at the latest within 72 hours) were eligible for the study.
The main exclusion criteria were a revascularization 
procedure already performed for the qualifying event, 
acute ST–segment elevation MI, receipt of a therapeutic 
dose of injectable anticoagulant for >24 hours before ran-
domization, or treatment with abciximab. The main results 
of the trial have been previously published: Otamixaban 
did not reduce the rate of the primary outcomes of death 
plus MI but did increase bleeding compared with heparin 
plus eptifibatide.11 From the TAO population, we selected 
patients with high-risk NSTEMI (ie, GRACE score >140) 
who make up the study cohort examined in the present 
analysis.
Timing of Angiography
For the purpose of the present analysis, patients with a 
GRACE score >140 and undergoing CAG were stratified into 
3 groups according to the timing of CAG from the first ECG 
performed on admission: very early (ie, <12 hours), early (ie, 
≥12–<24 hours), or delayed (ie, ≥24 hours) CAG.
Definitions and Outcomes
For the present analysis, the longest follow-up available was 
considered for the primary ischemic and bleeding outcomes.
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• In high-risk patients with non–ST-segment–eleva-
tion myocardial infarction (defined by a GRACE 
[Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events] score 
>140), a very early invasive strategy (ie, coronary 
angiography within the first 12 hours) was associ-
ated with a lower risk of ischemic outcomes (death 
and myocardial infarction) at 180 days compared 
with an early (12–24 hours) or a delayed (24–72 
hours) strategy.
• Bleeding risk was not different among patients 
managed with very early, early, or delayed strategy.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• In high-risk patients with non–ST-segment–eleva-
tion myocardial infarction, coronary angiography 
within 12 hours of admission may lead to improved 
outcomes, early optimization of antithrombotic 
treatments, and shorter hospitalization stays.
• These observations deserve prospective confirma-
tion in a randomized trial.

Efficacy Outcomes
Clinical follow-up was performed at 7, 30, and 180 days. The 
primary ischemic outcome of the present analysis was the 
composite of all-cause death or new MI from randomization 
to day 180.
Secondary efficacy outcome measures included the same 
composite ischemic end point at days 7 and 30. All-cause 
death, cardiovascular death, nonfatal MI, rehospitalization, 
and prolongation of the hospitalization as a result of MI and 
stent thrombosis were analyzed separately at days 30 and 
180. Stent thromboses were categorized according to the 
Academic Research Consortium classification,12 and MIs were 
categorized according to the 2007 universal definition.13
Safety Outcomes
The primary safety outcome was TIMI (Thrombosis in 
Myocardial Infarction) significant bleeding (defined as the 
composite of TIMI major and minor bleeding) from random-
ization to day 30. Other safety outcome measures included 
coronary artery bypass graft (CABG)–related and non–
CABG-related bleeding according to the TIMI classification, 
TIMI clinical bleeding, any clinical overt bleeding, TIMI bleed-
ing requiring medical attention, and TIMI minimal bleeding at 
day 30. Bleeding (other than fatal) was not captured beyond 
day 30.
Key efficacy and safety outcomes, including all procedural 
complications, were adjudicated by a central clinical event 
committee (TIMI Study Group) unaware of study treatment 
assignments and, in the case of procedural complications, 
with review of the angiograms.
Ethics
All patients provided written informed consent. In each coun-
try, the study was approved by ethics committees in accor-
dance with local guidelines.
Statistical Analysis
Patients were categorized into 3 groups according to the time 
to angiography from admission (defined by the time of the 
first ECG): <12, 12 to 24, and ≥24 hours. Descriptive statis-
tics are reported as means±SDs for continuous variables and 
patient numbers with percentages for categorical variables.
Categorical variables across groups were compared by χ2 
tests; continuous variables were compared by ANOVA.
Comparisons of event rates across groups were performed 
by χ2 tests. Primary end points based on time to the inclusion 
were assessed by comparison of Kaplan-Meier–based cumu-
lative incidence rates with the log-rank test. Multivariable 
logistic models for death and nonfatal MI were adjusted on 
the following predefined variables: age, sex, diabetes mel-
litus, previous PCI, creatinine concentration, systolic blood 
pressure, elevated biomarker at presentation, and heart fail-
ure. For bleeding complications, the route for arterial access 
(radial or femoral) was added to the model. The group 
undergoing CAG ≥24 hours was used as the reference for 
group comparisons. Sensitivity analyses adding variables with 
the greatest imbalance between groups, excluding peripro-
cedural MI (types 4b and 5), and exploring shorter delays 
were planned.
RESULTS
Baseline and Procedural Characteristics
Of 13 
229 patients randomized in the TAO trial, 13 
073 
(98.8%) had information on the time of first ECG and 
time of angiogram. Of those, 4071 patients (30.8% of 
the overall population) had a GRACE score >140 and 
underwent an invasive strategy. This group represents 
the study cohort (Figure 1). CAG was performed at an 
average of 17 hours after presentation. The delay be-
tween presentation and CAG was very early (ie, <12 
hours) for 1648 patients (40.5%), early (ie, ≥12–<24 
hours) for 1420 patients (34.9%), and delayed (ie, ≥24 
hours) in 1003 patients (24.6%). Of note, the invasive 
strategy led to PCI in 3,171 patients (77.9%) and to 
CABG surgery in 42 patients (1.0%).
Table 1 describes the baseline characteristics of the 
patients stratified according to time from ECG to CAG. 
Briefly, mean age was 70.6 years; 64.0% of patients 
were male; and 91% of patients had elevated tropo-
nin at presentation. Except for a higher proportion of 
patients from Eastern Europe in the very early group, 
the baseline characteristics and presentations were well 
balanced between the groups. The time between the 
latest ischemic symptoms and randomization increased 
in parallel with time to angiography.
Procedural characteristics are reported in Table 2. Of 
the 4071 patients, 3171 (77.9%) underwent PCI during 
the index admission, corresponding to 1372 (43.3%) in 
the very early group, 1059 (33.4%) in the early group, 
and 740 (23.3%) in the delayed group. The access site 
used was more often the radial artery in the very early 
cohort (53.2% versus 47.5% in the early and 46.4% 
in the delayed cohort). Patients in the very early group 
were more likely to undergo culprit artery PCI only dur-
ing the index procedure compared with patients in the 
other groups (62.1% versus 58.4% in the early and 
57.8% in the delayed group; P=0.01). Despite a modest 
difference between groups in baseline TIMI flow, final 
angiographic results were similar across the 3 groups. 
As expected, the duration of anticoagulation increased 
with the delay to CAG.
Outcomes
Efficacy Outcomes
Unadjusted outcomes are presented in Tables 3 and 
4. At 180 days, the unadjusted primary efficacy end 
point occurred in 177 patients (10.7%) in the very 
early cohort, 191 (13.5%) in the early cohort, and 137 
(13.7%) in the delayed group (P=0.03). Unadjusted 
Kaplan-Meier curves are presented in Figure 2. Patients 
in the very early cohort experienced fewer ischemic 
events than patients in the early and delayed cohorts

hours, P=0.028; ≥12–<24 versus ≥24 hours, P=0.91; 
Figure 2). After adjustment, with CAG ≥24 hours (ie, 
delayed group) taken as a reference, CAG ≥12 to <24 
hours (ie, early group) was not associated with a reduc-
tion of the primary outcome (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 
0.96; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.75–1.23; P=0.76), 
whereas CAG <12 hours (ie, very early group) was asso-
ciated with a lower risk of death and MI (adjusted OR, 
0.71; 95% CI, 0.55–0.91; P<0.01; Figure 3A).Perform-
ing CAG <12 hours was also associated with a lower 
risk of the primary end point (adjusted OR, 0.76; 95% 
CI, 0.61–0.94; P=0.01) compared with CAG performed 
12 to 24 hours after admission (Figure 3B).
There was no difference in the rates of the compos-
ite ischemic outcome at 7 and 30 days or for unplanned 
revascularization, rehospitalization, or prolongation of 
the hospitalization as a consequence of recurrent MI at 
30 and 180 days (Table 3). The incidence of nonfatal MI 
was numerically lower in the very early group and sig-
nificantly lower at 180 days (6.3% versus 8.3% versus 
8.8% in the very early, early, and delayed CAG groups, 
respectively; P=0.03).
Efficacy Outcomes: Sensitivity Analyses
A sensitivity analysis was performed examining the im-
pact of shorter delays to CAG in the very early CAG 
group. With CAG ≥24 hours as a reference, the reduc-
tion in the incidence of the primary end point was con-
sistent across all strata for very early angiography, albeit 
it became not statistically significant in patients under-
going CAG within 4 hours of admission (presumably 
because of the smaller sample size; Figure 4).
Because of an important imbalance between 
groups, we performed various sensitivity analyses by 
adding geographic origin and time between symptoms 
and admission to the multivariable logistic models. 
When geographic location was added to the multi-
variable logistic model, undergoing a CAG <12 hours 
was associated with numerically lower (although not 
significant) incidence of the primary outcome than 
CAG ≥24 hours (10.75% versus 14.14%; P=0.08) 
and CAG ≥12 to <24 hours (10.75% versus 13.34%; 
P=0.04; model 2 in Figure I in the online-only Data 
Supplement). Similar results were observed when the 
time between symptoms and admission was added to 
the multivariable logistic model (CAG <12 versus >24 
hours, P<0.01; and CAG <12 versus ≥12–<24 hours, 
P=0.06; model 3 in the Figure I in the online-only Data 
Supplement).
When periprocedural MIs were excluded from the 
outcomes of interest (reducing power), there were 
numerically lower (although not significant) rates of 
the primary end point for CAG <12 hours compared 
with CAG ≥12 to <24 hours (6.93% versus 8.15%; 
OR, 0.81; P=0.12) and CAG ≥24 hours (6.93% versus

Supplement).
Safety Outcomes
The primary safety outcome occurred in 4.2% of the 
very early cohort patients, 3.2% of the early cohort, 
and 4.9% of the delayed group (P=0.12) at 30 days 
(Table 3). Figure 5 shows the incidence of the unadjust-
ed primary safety end point at 30 days in the 3 groups 
(<12 versus ≥12–<24 hours, P=0.26; <12 versus ≥24 
hours, P=0.35; ≥12–<24 versus ≥24 hours, P=0.06). 
After adjustment, with the group undergoing CAG ≥24 
hours used as reference, CAG <12 hours or between 
12 and 24 hours was not associated with an excess risk 
of bleeding at 180 days (adjusted OR for the primary 
safety outcome, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.56–1.29; P=0.44; and 
adjusted OR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.44–1.09; P=0.11; Fig-
ure 6A). Likewise, among patients with CAG performed 
within the first 24 hours, CAG in the first 12 compared 
with 12 to 24 hours was not associated with a differ-
ence in the primary safety end point (adjusted OR, 1.26; 
95% CI, 0.85–1.85; P=0.24; Figure 6B).
Sensitivity analyses with geographic location and 
time between symptoms and admission added to the 
multivariable logistic model showed consistent findings 
(Figure III in the online-only Data Supplement).
No differences were observed in TIMI major, TIMI 
CABG- and non–CABG-related, and TIMI minor bleed-
ing events at 30 days. The rates of any clinical overt 
bleeding, TIMI bleeding requiring medical attention, 
and TIMI minimal bleeding were all consistently and sig-
nificantly lower in patients undergoing very early CAG

DISCUSSION
In the present analysis, among patients with high-risk 
NSTEMI, defined by a GRACE score >140, a very early 
invasive strategy (ie, within the first 12 hours) was as-
sociated with a lower risk of death and MI at 180 days 
without an increase in bleeding risk compared with an 
early or a delayed strategy.
Several trials have addressed the issue of optimal 
timing for an invasive strategy in patients with NSTE-
MI. The TIMACS trial (Timing of Intervention in Acute 
Coronary Syndromes) showed a reduction in death, MI, 
or stroke at 6 months in patients with a GRACE score 
>140 with an early (≤24 hours) compared with a de-
layed (≥36 hours) invasive strategy, whereas there were 
no differences between early and delayed strategies in 
patients with low to intermediate risk.5 Moreover, in the 
ACUITY trial (Acute Catheterization and Urgent Inter-
vention Triage Strategy), delay to PCI >24 hours was an 
independent predictor of 30-day and 1-year mortality.14 
From this evidence, American and European guidelines 
provide a Grade I recommendation for an early invasive 
strategy in the first 24 hours for high-risk NSTEMI only 
(ie, GRACE score >140, dynamic electrocardiographic 
changes, troponin rise) and 72 hours for others.1,2
A meta-analysis including 10 trials from 2000 to 
2016 has recently compared early (0.5–14 hours) and 
delayed (18.3–86 hours) strategies in 6397 patients 
with moderate- to high-risk NSTEMI15 and found no 
difference in terms of mortality or MI but showed re-
duction in the risk of recurrent ischemia or refractory 
angina in the early arm. In contrast to the present study, 
that meta-analysis did not specifically focus on high-risk 
patients, who are more likely to benefit from a very ear-
ly strategy. Moreover, this meta-analysis included stud-
ies with wide heterogeneity in terms of MI and bleeding 
definitions, making comparability difficult.
A strategy of immediate invasive management, simi-
lar to that implemented for primary PCI in patients with 
STEMI, has been tested in NSTEMI. The ISAR-COOL study 
(Intracoronary Stenting With Antithrombotic Regimen 
Cooling-Off) compared angiography within 6 hours with 
delayed angiography (3–5 days), demonstrating that the 
urgent approach was superior in preventing death or 
MI.6 Those results are supported by the recent RIDDLE-
NSTEMI study (Immediate Versus Delayed Invasive Inter-
vention for Non-STEMI Patients) in which an immediate 
strategy (1.4 versus 61 hours) reduced the composite 
of death and MI compared with a delayed invasive pro-
cedure, a benefit driven largely by a reduction in MI.9

Delayed Invasive Intervention for Non-STEMI Patients] 
and ABOARD [Angioplasty to Blunt the Rise of Troponin 
in Acute Coronary Syndromes Randomized for an Imme-
diate or Delayed Intervention]) showed no benefit and 
even possible harm (increase in the incidence of ischemic 
events in OPTIMA) from an immediate invasive approach 
(0.5 and 1.1 hours to catheterization, respectively).7,8 
These trials were of small to moderate size and do not 
provide a consistent signal of benefit or harm. Accord-
ingly, even if not specifically tested in high-risk patients, 
an immediate invasive strategy for NSTEMI, similar to the 
approach used in primary PCI, is not considered to have 
established benefits but is associated with important lo-
gistical issues in terms of widespread implementation.
In our study, very early CAG was associated with a 
lower rate of ischemic outcomes (death and MI) at 180 
days compared with an early or a delayed strategy. The 
different sensitivity analyses and the analyses of out-
comes at 7 and 30 days showed consistent results with 
numerically lower rates of ischemic outcomes in pa-

tients undergoing CAG <12 hours. However, the differ-
ences observed were not significant. This might be the 
result of a substantial decrease in the number of events 
analyzed, leading to underpowered analyses.
The variation in MI definitions across studies and the 
difficulties in ascertaining recurrent MI in patients treated 
with PCI for an acute ongoing index MI make the com-
parison between trials difficult. An immediate invasive 
strategy can lead to harm, driven mainly by increasing 
the risk of PCI complications, given the fact that oral an-
tiplatelet agents need at least 3 to 4 hours after a load-
ing dose to be effective.16 However, only the OPTIMA 
trial reported an increased rate of procedure-related MI 
in patients undergoing immediate CAG for NSTEMI.7 On

the other hand, the observed differences in events in the 
ISAR-COOL and RIDDLE NSTEMI trials were attributable 
mainly to lower rates of recurrent MI in the precatheter-
ization period in patients with immediate intervention; 
no significant difference in outcomes were observed 
after discharge up to 1 year.6,9 In the present analysis, 
when periprocedural MIs were excluded, the difference 
did not remain significant despite a lower incidence of 
the primary end point in the very early group compared 
with the 2 other groups (presumably a result of a smaller 
number of events and the associated lack of power).
In our cohort, neither the thrombus burden during 
the index procedure nor the final angiographic result 
differed according to the delay to CAG. Moreover, the 
number of thrombotic complications during the index 
procedure and bailout use of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibi-
tors did not differ between groups.
The ischemic benefit in high-risk patients treated dur-
ing the first 12 hours seems to be maintained in the long 
term, with the difference increasing up to 180 days, com-
pared with the early strategy. The benefit associated with 
the very early strategy appeared to be driven by a reduc-
tion of the incidence of MI throughout the follow-up, with 
the curves continuing to separate over time. These find-
ings suggest that the benefit of a very early strategy is 
driven by the prevention of periprocedural MI and late MI.
Dual antiplatelet therapy and anticoagulants are 
recommended in NSTEMI until angiography is per-
formed.1,2 A meaningful proportion of patients admit-
ted with NSTEMI will not require a PCI and are exposed 
to a higher bleeding risk until the CAG is performed. In 
addition, in acute coronary syndromes, anticoagulation 
is typically discontinued after revascularization; there-
fore, patients receiving earlier PCI are likely to have a 
shorter duration of anticoagulation. Accordingly, in 
our cohort, the duration of anticoagulation increased 
proportionally with the delay of CAG. It is conceivable 
that early invasive assessment may allow a shorter ex-
posure to anticoagulation and early decisions about the 
discontinuation of antithrombotic strategies and thus 
reduce the risk of bleeding complications. However, in 
our cohort, the time to the procedure was not associ-

Last, the duration of the index hospitalization was 
shorter in patients undergoing early invasive manage-
ment, and this may translate to improved organization 
of care and potential financial benefits.

Limitations
Although multivariable adjustment was used to cor-
rect for measured differences between groups, we 
cannot exclude the presence of residual confounding, 
particularly with unmeasured variables. It is important 
to note that this study is a post hoc analysis, and our 
findings should therefore be interpreted as hypothesis 
generating.
Moreover, the TAO NSTEMI cohort was character-
ized by a high rate of use of femoral access for CAG 
(with significant differences between the 3 groups), 
a substantial rate of use of bare metal stents, and 
routine use of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors in the 
heparin arm.1,2 Differences in management of NSTEMI 
such as greater use of radial access and drug-eluting 
stents or a lower rate of use of potent antiplatelet 
agents may affect ischemic and bleeding outcomes 
and the result of any comparison between groups 
based on time to CAG.
Last, when baseline geographic differences and time 
between symptoms and admission were added to the 
sensitivity model, the analyses, although consistent, did 
not reach statistical significance for the primary efficacy 
end point. This may reflect reduced statistical power 
with the reduction of the number of patients evaluated.
Conclusions

within the initial 12 hours (as opposed to between 12 
and 24 or ≥24 hours after admission) was associated 
with a lower risk of ischemic outcomes at 180 days 
without an increase in bleeding risk. This observation 
deserves prospective confirmation and has potentially 
important implications for the organization of care.
