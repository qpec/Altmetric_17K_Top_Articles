Purpose
Despite advances in childhood cancer care, some patients die soon after diagnosis. This population
is not well described and may be under-reported. Better understanding of risk factors for early death
and scope of the problem could lead to prevention of these occurrences and thus better survival
rates in childhood cancer.
Methods
We retrieved data from SEER 13 registries on 36,337 patients age 0 to 19 years diagnosed with
cancer between 1992 and 2011. Early death was defined as death within 1 month of diagnosis.
Socioeconomic status data for each individual’s county of residence were derived from Census
2000. Crude and adjusted odds ratios and corresponding 95% CIs were estimated for the asso-
ciation between early death and demographic, clinical, and socioeconomic factors.
Results
Percentage of early death in the period was 1.5% (n = 555). Children with acute myeloid leukemia,
infant acute lymphoblastic leukemia, hepatoblastoma, and malignant brain tumors had the highest
risk of early death. On multivariable analysis, an age younger than 1 year was a strong predictor of
early death in all disease groups examined. Black race and Hispanic ethnicity were both risk factors
for early death in multiple disease groups. Residence in counties with lower than median average
income was associated with a higher risk of early death in hematologic malignancies. Percentages of
early death decreased significantly over time, especially in hematologic malignancies.
Conclusion
Risk factors for early death in childhood cancer include an age younger than 1 year, specific di-
agnoses, minority race and ethnicity, and disadvantaged socioeconomic status. The population-
based disease-specific percentages of early death were uniformly higher than those reported in
cooperative clinical trials, suggesting that early death is under-reported in the medical literature.
Initiatives to identify those at risk and develop preventive interventions should be prioritized.

INTRODUCTION
Childhood cancer outcomes have improved sig-
nificantly over the past decades in the United
States.1 However, there remains a group of chil-
dren with cancer who do not survive long enough
to start treatment, or they die early in the treat-
ment process. Although this group is relatively
small, it represents a significant number of
childhood cancer deaths, many of which may be
preventable. The characteristics of these in-
dividuals and the reasons for their poor outcomes
are not well understood. Most of our knowledge
of pediatric oncology outcomes is derived from
clinical trials; we hypothesized that early death
may be under-reported in clinical trial reports
because many of these children and adolescents
die before enrollment or may be ineligible as
a result of critical illness at presentation.
Two prior population-based studies have
explored this topic. An analysis of pediatric cancer
deaths within 1 month of diagnosis between 1967
and 1998, using the Childhood Cancer Registry of
Piedmont in Italy, revealed that risk factors for
early death included an age younger than 1 year,
disseminated disease at diagnosis, diagnosis ear-
lier in the study period, and specific diseases, such
as acute myeloid leukemia (AML), non-Hodgkin
lymphoma, CNS tumors, and liver tumors.2 A
second study analyzed early deaths in the United
States from 1973 to 1995,3 using data from the

 SEER registry. Greater risk was noted for infants overall and for
children with leukemia, CNS tumors, liver tumors, or neuroblas-
toma. This study did not find race or ethnicity to be associated with
early death risk. Several studies have shown an impact of socio-
economic status on diagnosis and outcomes in pediatric cancer,4-10
a topic summarized in a recent systematic review11; however, its
relationship with risk for early death was not addressed.
In our population-based study, we sought to define the scope
and characteristics of this poorly characterized group of children
with cancer who die shortly after diagnosis, using SEER data to
describe their demographics, disease, and socioeconomic status
characteristics to identify groups at risk for which targeted in-
terventions should be developed.
METHODS
Study Design
This was a retrospective cohort study using population-based data.
Data Source and Study Cohort
Individuals age 0 to 19 years with any childhood cancer (International
Classification of Childhood Cancer [ICCC] groups I to XII) diagnosed in
the period from 1992 to 2011 were selected from SEER 13 registries
through SEER*Stat software (version 8.1.5). Only the first matching record
for each individual was included, to exclude second malignancies in those
children and adolescents with multiple primary tumors. The SEER pro-
gram is run by the National Cancer Institute as a source of information on
cancer incidence and survival. SEER 13 encompasses the following cancer
registries: Atlanta, Connecticut, Detroit, Hawaii, Iowa, New Mexico, San
Francisco–Oakland, Seattle–Puget Sound, Utah, Los Angeles, San Jose–
Monterey, rural Georgia, and the Alaska Native Tumor Registry. Although
it covers only 13.4% of the US population, it is designed to represent both
its geographic and social diversity.
Outcome
Early death was defined as survival duration , 1 month from the time
of diagnosis and vital status recode dead. One month was chosen as the
time point of interest because this represented the shortest time interval
available for analysis in the SEER database. All other patients were classified
as nonearly death, including all living children and adolescents and those
who died $ 1 month from diagnosis.
Individual-Level Demographic Variables
The early death and nonearly death groups were compared on the
basis of the following individual-level variables: age, sex, race (white, black,
or other), and ethnicity (Hispanic or non-Hispanic). Individuals were
divided into age categories at diagnosis (younger than 1, 1 to 4, 5 to 9, 10 to
14, and 15 to 19 years).
Year of Diagnosis
Year of diagnosis was used to create a variable with five periods: 1992
to 1995, 1996 to 1999, 2000 to 2003, 2004 to 2007, and 2008 to 2011.
Census-Based Socioeconomic Status Variables
The early death and nonearly death groups were also compared using
the following socioeconomic status indicators (based on Census 2000) for
each individual’s county of residence: percentage of families in poverty,
percentage of people with less than high school education, percentage of
unemployed people, percentage of families in language isolation, per-
centage of foreign-born people, and median household income. For each

Green et al
 of these attributes, patients were grouped into two categories separated by
the median value for the study cohort (Appendix Table A1, online only).
Cancer Subtypes
The ICCC third edition (ICCC-3)12 was used to define three broad
tumor categories: non-CNS solid tumors (ICCC-3 groups IV to XII),
hematologic malignancies (ICCC-3 groups I to II), and CNS tumors
(ICCC-3 group III). We also analyzed the risk of early death based on the
12 main ICCC-3 categories using neuroblastoma, a common childhood
cancer that fell near the center for early death risk, as the reference group.
The diagnoses were then subdivided into more-specific ICCC-3 categories
to determine the risk of early death resulting from these more-specific
diseases, also in relation to neuroblastoma. The usual age cutoff of younger
than 1 year at diagnosis was used for infant acute lymphoblastic leukemia
(ALL). Low-grade gliomas were defined as grade 1 to 2 and high grade as
3 to 4.
Staging
Disease stage at diagnosis was evaluated by categorizing patients’
disease as locoregional versus distant using SEER historic stage A; children
and adolescents without a documented stage at diagnosis in this classi-
fication were excluded from this specific analysis. Because individuals with
leukemia were categorized as having distant disease, and because staging
information for CNS tumors was available for only 4.3% of the cohort,
staging information was analyzed only for patients with solid tumors.
Statistical Analysis
Two-tailed x2 or Fisher’s exact test was used to study the association
of categorical variables with occurrence of early death. Logistic regression
was used to identify independent predictors. For each disease type,
a hierarchic model was built including all variables that achieved a P value
, .25 in the univariable analysis. The Hosmer-Lemeshow test was used to
check goodness of fit. Crude and adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and corre-
sponding 95% CIs were estimated. All statistical tests were performed using
STATA 13 software (STATA, College Station, TX), and a = .05 was used to
define statistical significance. Data were exported into Joinpoint (version
4.2.0.1; Statistical Research and Applications Branch, National Cancer In-
stitute, Bethesda, MD) to examine changes in the early death percentages
over time and estimate annual percentage changes (APCs) using a Joinpoint
regression model.
RESULTS
Study Groups and Disease Categories
Our cohort included 36,337 children and adolescents with
cancer diagnosed from 1992 to 2011. Early death was registered for
555 individuals (1.5%). The total number of deaths over this
period was 7,403, so the early death group represented 7.5% of
total deaths. Compared with the nonearly death group, the early
death group had higher proportions of hematologic malignancies
(49.9% v 40.9%) and CNS tumors (27.9% v 18.3%) and a lower
proportion of solid tumors (22.2% v 40.7%; Appendix Fig A1,
online only). In comparison with children and adolescents with
solid tumors (0.8% of whom experienced early deaths), those with
hematologic malignancies (early death, 1.8%; OR, 2.23; 95% CI,
1.80 to 2.76) or CNS tumors (early death, 2.3%; OR, 2.80; 95% CI,
2.21 to 3.56) had a significantly higher risk of early death (Ap-
pendix Table A2, online only). Given these differences in the

Death Within 1 Month of Diagnosis in Childhood Cancer
 percentages of early death resulting from disease, we divided our
univariable and multivariable analyses of predictors of early death
along these three disease groups.
Early Death Risk by Cancer Subtype
When cancer diagnoses were divided into the 12 large ICCC-3
categories, liver tumors, leukemias, and CNS tumors conveyed
significantly increased risk of early death when compared with
neuroblastoma as a standard, whereas renal and epithelial tumors
carried significantly lower risk (Appendix Table A2).
Next, the early death risk for a set of more specific diagnoses
was also compared with that for neuroblastoma as a standard (Fig 1;
Appendix Table A2). AML, infant ALL, hepatoblastoma, and
several types of malignant CNS tumors were among the cancers
with a significantly higher OR of early death. Malignant melanoma,
Hodgkin lymphoma, osteosarcoma, low-grade glioma, and Wilms
tumor showed a significantly lower OR of early death.
Demographic and Socioeconomic Predictors of Early
Death: Univariable Analysis
Demographic and socioeconomic predictors of early death
identified in the univariable analysis are listed in Table 1.
Hematologic malignancies. Infants (age younger than 1 year;
OR, 4.36; 95% CI, 2.79 to 6.80) and adolescents (age 15 to 19 years;
OR, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.19 to 2.39) had significantly increased risks of
early death compared with individuals in the 10- to 14-year age
group. Black race was associated with a higher risk of early death
compared with white race (OR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.03 to 2.13), and
Hispanics had a higher risk of early death compared with non-
Hispanics (OR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.09 to 1.79). There was no dif-
ference in early death risk by sex. With the exception of foreign-
born status, all county-based social disadvantages were associated
with significantly higher risks of early death, including those re-
lated to education (OR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.83), poverty (OR,
1.70; 95% CI, 1.32 to 2.19), language isolation (OR, 1.28; 95% CI,
1.01 to 1.63), unemployment (OR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.06 to 1.72), and
income (OR, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.30 to 2.12). Diagnosis during the last
study period (2008 to 2011) was associated with a lower early death
risk than during the first period (1992 to 1995; OR, 0.62; 95% CI,
0.41 to 0.94).
CNS tumors. A statistically significant association was ob-
served between age group and early death: infants (OR, 19.30; 95%
CI, 10.40 to 35.81), children age 1 to 4 years (OR, 2.91; 95% CI,
1.56 to 5.43), and adolescents age 15 to 19 years (OR, 2.05; 95% CI,
1.01 to 4.13) had significantly increased early death risk compared
with individuals age 10 to 14 years. No significant differences in
early death rates were noted by race or sex. Hispanic children and
adolescents had an increased early death risk compared with non-
Hispanics (OR, 2.04; 95% CI, 1.47 to 2.85). Individuals living in
disadvantaged areas in terms of poverty (OR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.04 to
1.99), foreign-born status (OR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.93), lan-
guage isolation (OR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.21 to 2.32), and un-
employment (OR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.94) also had significantly
increased early death risks compared with those living in advan-
taged areas. Income and education were not significantly associated
with early death in this group.
Solid tumors. Infants were the only age group that signifi-
cantly differed from the reference category of patients age 10 to 14
years regarding early death risk (OR, 7.98; 95% CI, 3.91 to 16.29).
No differences in percentage of early death were noted by ethnicity
or sex. Black race was associated with an increased early death risk
compared with white (OR, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.05 to 2.81). Distant
disease at diagnosis was associated with occurrence of early death
(OR, 7.53; 95% CI, 4.81 to 11.78). None of the socioeconomic
status characteristics were significantly associated with early death
risk in this group.
Demographic and Socioeconomic Predictors of Early
Death: Multivariable Analysis
Demographic and socioeconomic predictors of early death
identified in the multivariable analysis are listed in Table 2.
Hematologic
malignancies. In
the
multivariable
model,
adjusting for poverty, unemployment, education, and year of di-
agnosis, age younger than 1 year (OR, 4.32; 95% CI, 2.76 to 6.78)
or 15 to 19 years (OR, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.24 to 2.51), Hispanic
ethnicity (OR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.10 to 1.99), black race (OR, 1.68;
95% CI, 1.13 to 2.49), and income (OR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.07 to 2.14)
remained as independent predictors of early death.
CNS tumors. After controlling for poverty and year of di-
agnosis, age younger than 1 year (OR, 18.55; 95% CI, 9.97 to
34.53), 1 to 4 years (OR, 2.84; 95% CI, 1.52 to 5.31), and 15 to 19
years (OR, 2.10; 95% CI, 1.04 to 4.24) and Hispanic ethnicity (OR,
1.66; 95% CI, 1.16 to 2.37) were the only independent predictors of
early death for children and adolescents with CNS tumors.
Solid tumors. An age younger than 1 year (OR, 5.34; 95% CI,
2.41 to 11.83) was also identified as an independent significant
early death predictor for individuals with solid tumors, as were
black race (OR, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.03 to 3.44) and distant spread of
disease (OR, 7.37; 95% CI, 4.65 to 11.68), after the model was
adjusted for ethnicity and year of diagnosis.
Time Trends in Early Death Rates
Over the 20-year study period, a significant overall decrease in
early death percentages was observed (APC, 22.5; 95% CI, 23.9
to 21.1). When the analysis was stratified by tumor type, we
observed that only hematologic malignancies showed a statistically
significant decrease in early death occurrence (APC, 23.5; 95%
CI, 25.7 to 21.3). Changes in early death rates for solid tumors
(APC, 22.9; 95% CI, 26.1 to 0.3) and CNS tumors (APC, 20.8;
95% CI, 24.3 to 2.8), although demonstrating declining trends
over time, did not achieve statistical significance (Fig 2).
DISCUSSION
In this population-based study, we have characterized the pop-
ulation of children and adolescents with cancer who die within
1 month of diagnosis, which represents 7.5% of all deaths in this
cohort. This group is important to study because these individuals
die too soon to benefit fully from the therapeutic advances that
have been achieved in pediatric oncology over the last generation.
Infants and older adolescents are at a disproportionately high risk
of early death, as are individuals with specific diagnoses such as

 AML, infant ALL, malignant CNS tumors, and hepatoblastoma.
Although these findings in part confirm those from prior studies of
early death based on SEER and Italian Childhood Cancer Registry
of Piedmont databases,2,3 we have provided additional evidence
that in some cases contradicts that of prior studies, including the
significant impact of race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status on
early death risk. Finally, we have shown that overall rates of early
death seem to be decreasing.
Despite the decrease in early death rates observed over time,
we hypothesized that the overall scope of early deaths in childhood
cancer would be greater than that reported in the clinical trial
literature, by far the most prominent source of childhood cancer
outcome data. Five multi-institutional phase III trials conducted by
the Children’s Oncology Group or its predecessors during our
study period opened enrollment to all patients from one disease
group examined in this study and included data on deaths within
the first month after initiation of therapy.13-18 When we compared
the early death percentages from these trials with those from SEER,
both over the time period of the trial and over the entire time
period of our study, we found that the percentages of early deaths
in the SEER database were consistently higher than the early death
rates reported in the trials (Table 3). The early death percentages in
SEER ranged from approximately twice the value observed in
noninfant ALL to greater by a factor of 12.5 in Wilms tumor. One
limitation of SEER is that we cannot know when during the first
month from diagnosis death occurred. We interpreted the in-
creased early deaths in SEER versus clinical trials as likely having
occurred before the chance for clinical trial enrollment and thus

Death Within 1 Month of Diagnosis in Childhood Cancer
 a result of disease as opposed to early treatment toxicity. This
disparity introduces an important bias in our overall interpretation
of clinical trial results. Socioeconomically disadvantaged patients
are also less likely to enroll in clinical trials,19 which may further
magnify the disparity.
A major limitation of SEER is the limited availability of the
underlying cause of death; the explanation for the increased early
death risk in certain disease types is therefore not completely clear.
For some diseases, individuals may present with life-threatening
acute illness. For example, leukostasis and hemorrhage have been
documented as causes of early death in children with AML20; this
may explain the significantly higher percentages of early death for
children and adolescents with this diagnosis found in our study.
With advances in anticancer treatment and supportive care, the
early death percentage is decreasing over time; this is the result in
greatest part of decreases in early death for individuals with he-
matologic malignancies, probably reflecting improvements in
infection control and supportive care.21
As advances through clinical and translational research
continue to increase the percentage of children and adolescents
with cancer who can be cured, we must readily address the under-
reported problem of early death and assure that all individuals have
the opportunity to receive the best available treatments; as shown
here, up to 1.5% of children with cancer die before they can fully
benefit from modern therapies, accounting for 7.5% of childhood
cancer deaths. We advocate a two-pronged approach in addressing
this problem. First, prospective registration studies at the co-
operative group level should be considered that could capture
individual-level socioeconomic status characteristics, as well as clinical
data, including timing of diagnosis and death and underlying,
intermediate, and direct causes of death, independent of clinical
trial enrollment. Prospective studies such as Project Every Child by
the Children’s Oncology Group could potentially fill this gap in
knowledge by prospectively collecting outcome data and could
create future study opportunities by storing cancer samples in
a biorepository for subsequent analysis. This could pave the way for
future research on understanding which patients are at risk for
early death, causes of early death, and how to prevent early death.
Second, specific initiatives targeting risk groups identified here
should be developed now to allow earlier diagnosis and treatment,
to make care more equitable for all children and adolescents with
cancer.
