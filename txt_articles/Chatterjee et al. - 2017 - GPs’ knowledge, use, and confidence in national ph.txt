 INTRODUCTION
The World Health Organization (WHO) 
describes physical activity (PA) as any bodily 
movement produced by skeletal muscles 
that requires energy expenditure.1 Exercise 
is a subgroup of PA where the activity is 
planned, structured, repetitive, and aims 
to improve or maintain one or more 
components of physical fitness.1
In 2011, the UK Chief Medical Officers 
(CMOs), as the statutory medical advisors to 
government, issued age-specific guidelines 
on PA for the general population.2 Around 
one in two females and a third of males in 
England are not achieving the targets of 
these guidelines, and are damaging their 
health as a result. More than one in four 
females and one in five males are classified 
as ‘inactive’ by doing less than 30 minutes of 
PA per week.3,4 Physical inactivity is among 
the top 10 risk factors for disease and 
disability in England.5 It is an unsustainable 
situation, and is costing the UK an estimated 
£7.4 billion a year, including £0.9 billion of 
preventable costs to the NHS.6,7 
The UK guidelines are based on WHO 
standards, which have been adopted by 
most Western countries. International 
comparison suggests that UK citizens aged 
≥15 years are more likely to be inactive 
than their counterparts in most comparable 
countries in the world;8 63.3% of people 
in the UK fail to achieve a benchmark of 
activity, compared with 40.5% in the US, 
37.9% in Australia, 32.5% in France, 28% in 
Germany, and 18.2% in Holland.8 
The UK guidelines are incorporated 
within clinical guidelines, including the 
2013 National Institute for Health and 
Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines for 
brief PA advice, which recommends using 
the General Practice Physical Activity 
Questionnaire (GPPAQ) to identify those who 
are not meeting the guidelines and who 
should therefore receive the intervention.9 
GPPAQ is a brief measure of PA in patients 
aged 16–74 years that is designed to take less 
than a minute to complete, and can either be 
completed by the patient themselves, or with 
the assistance of a healthcare professional.10 
Patients are classed as inactive, moderately 
inactive, moderately active, and active. Those 
who rate less than active are deemed not to 
meet the national guidelines and so should 
receive an intervention from a healthcare 
professional. GPPAQ was integrated across 
GP clinical information technology (IT) 
systems in England to support primary 
care staff using a validated tool to assess 
PA and promote behaviour change. It also 
forms part of the routine tools used in the 
NHS Health Check interview in England, 
which is primarily undertaken by other 
healthcare professionals, rather than by GPs 
themselves.11
One in four people say they would be 
more active if advised by a GP or nurse.12 
Health professional-led PA interventions are 
very effective, with brief advice for PA having 
a number needed to treat of 12, up to 10 
Research
Abstract
Background
Physical activity (PA) brief advice in health care 
is effective at getting individuals active. It has 
been suggested that one in four people would 
be more active if advised by a GP or nurse, 
but as many as 72% of GPs do not discuss the 
benefits of physical activity with patients. 
Aim
To assess the knowledge, use, and confidence 
in national PA and Chief Medical Officer (CMO) 
health guidelines and tools among GPs in 
England. 
Design and setting
Online questionnaire-based survey of self-
selecting GPs in England that took place over a 
10-day period in March 2016.
Method
The questionnaire consisted of six multiple-choice 
questions and was available on the Doctors.net.uk 
(DNUK) homepage. Quotas were used to ensure 
good regional representation.
Results
The final analysis included 1013 responses. Only 
20% of responders were broadly or very familiar 
with the national PA guidelines. In all, 70% of GPs 
were aware of the General Practice Physical 
Activity Questionnaire (GPPAQ), but 26% were 
not familiar with any PA assessment tools, and 
55% reported that they had not undertaken any 
training with respect to encouraging PA.
Conclusion
The majority of GPs in England (80%) are 
unfamiliar with the national PA guidelines. 
Awareness of the recommended tool for 
assessment, GPPAQ, is higher than use by GPs. 
This may be because it is used by other clinical 
staff, for example, as part of the NHS Health 
Check programme. Although brief advice in 
isolation by GPs on PA will only be a part of the 
behaviour change journey, it is an important 
prompt, especially if repeated as part of routine 
practice. This study highlights the need for 
significant improvement in knowledge, skills, 
and confidence to maximise the potential for PA 
advice in GP consultations.

GPs’ knowledge, use, and confidence in national 
physical activity and health guidelines and tools: 
a questionnaire-based survey of general practice in England

 times more effective than smoking brief 
advice.13,14 One study has shown 70–80% 
of professionals do not speak to patients 
about PA.15
Assessment and advice about PA as a 
routine part of healthcare services has been 
identified as one of the best investments 
for increasing PA.16 A study has also shown 
the importance of primary care behaviour 
change for PA to the UK achieving the WHO 
target of a 25% reduction in premature 
mortality by 2025.17 
As with other brief advice, behaviour 
change is best supported by repeated 
routine enquiry and advice, supplemented 
by assessment tools to reinforce progress 
and achievement.9,18 
There 
are 
several 
patient-centred 
studies that have investigated awareness 
of PA guidelines, beliefs about activity, 
and reasons for non-participation in 
exercise.19–21 However, there is only limited 
literature available on knowledge of PA 
measurement tools and guidelines by 
healthcare professionals. These papers 
are low powered, with small sample sizes 
(n = 14 231 and n = 177, respectively) and 
are only regionally based.22–24
The aim of this study was to assess 
knowledge, use, and confidence in PA 
guidelines and PA assessment tools by GPs. 
The specific objectives of this study were:
• to measure overall awareness of the 
national guidelines by GPs;
• to identify awareness by GPs of the tools 
available to support the guidelines;
• to measure understanding of GPs on how 
to use the tools;
• to assess how many GPs have undertaken 
training on the use of tools and 
interventions; 
• to measure GPs’ confidence in raising the 
issue of PA in consultations; and
• to identify whether, and with whom, GPs 
raise the issue of PA.
METHOD
Study design
The 
questionnaire-based 
study 
was 
commissioned by Public Health England 
(PHE).25 Questions were compiled by an 
advisory panel including academics, 
policymakers, GPs with a special interest, 
and internal experts in PA and general 
practice. Questionnaire design, scripting, 
and quality assurance were conducted by 
PHE. Collection and processing of data were 
carried out by MedeConnect Healthcare 
Insight (MHI), the market research division 
of the Doctors.net.uk (DNUK) group.26 
The study was conducted between 
16 March 
and 
26 March 
2016. 
The 
questionnaire was available at any time 
during this time period from any computer
. 
The questionnaire had a multiple-choice 
question (MCQ) format, where one or more 
answers could be provided to each of six 
questions (Box 1).
Individuals were given the option to leave 
more detailed comments for each question. 
Answers were automatically saved, which 
meant the questionnaire was not required to 
be completed in one sitting. Demographics 
also had to be provided.
The survey was live on the DNUK website, 
with an invitation placed on the homepage 
of all GPs who visited the website during the 
study period. Participation was by choice of 
the individual.
How this fits in
Advice from a healthcare practitioner has 
been effective at getting individuals active, 
but many GPs do not discuss physical activity 
(PA) with their patients. This study found 
the majority of GPs (80%) are unfamiliar 
with the national PA guidelines. Use of tools 
to assess patient PA, such as the General 
Practice Physical Activity Questionnaire 
(GPPAQ), are within clinical guidelines and, 
though the majority of GPs are aware of 
them (70%), most do not understand or use 
them in practice, and are unconfident in 
raising the subject with patients. Knowledge 
of the guidelines increased the likelihood 
that a GP would know about the tools, use 
them, and raise the issue of PA with patients 
whose conditions could benefit. Provision of 
training on PA for GPs could increase patient 
behaviour change, resulting in improved 
clinical outcomes, as well as disease 
prevention. 
Box 1. Six questions from the 
study questionnaire
1.  
How familiar or unfamiliar are you with the 
Chief Medical Officers’ physical activity (PA) 
guidelines?
2.  
Which, if any, of the following tools are you 
aware of to help assess patient PA? And 
which do you use?
3.  
How well do you feel you understand how to 
use these tools in day-to-day practice?
4.  
Which, if any, of the following training 
sessions have you undertaken with respect 
to encouraging PA?
5.  
How confident or unconfident would you 
describe yourself in terms of raising PA with 
your patients?
6.  
For patients with which of the following 
conditions would you discuss and 
recommend PA to?

 Quotas were used to ensure good regional 
representation and to mitigate regional 
variation in local initiatives. Quotas were 
based on the last workforce data showing 
geographical distribution of GPs through 
strategic health authorities. Once a quota 
was completed it was closed, so that no 
more GPs from that area could begin the 
survey. All GPs who were already in the 
process of completing the survey were 
allowed to finish it, and were included in the 
final sample.
The survey aimed to reach a minimum 
sample size of around 1000 GPs to allow 
enough power in the study for analysis. A 
financial incentive was offered to encourage 
individuals to take part in the survey. 
Responders were only able to complete the 
questionnaire once, as the DNUK system 
only allowed a particular user to interact 
with the survey once.
Inclusion criteria
Responders were drawn from the DNUK 
community of General Medical Council 
(GMC)-registered doctors. Membership of 
DNUK required a GMC registration number, 
where members were matched to the 
monthly GMC register
. Only GP partners, 
salaried GPs, GP registrars, and locum GPs 
who were based in England were invited to 
participate. 
Exclusion criteria
Doctors in Scotland, Wales, and Northern 
Ireland were ineligible. Those who did not 
fully complete the questionnaire or answered 
a question that contradicted the inclusion 
criteria were excluded. When a regional 
quota was reached, no further responders 
from that region could participate. Non-
doctors, and doctors who were neither GPs 
nor GP registrars, were ineligible.
Data analysis
Data from each of the six MCQs were cross-
matched against each other and also with 
the demographics to allow identification 
of any correlations. The t-test and 95% 
confidence intervals (CIs) were used 
to assess whether differences in results 
between the different demographic groups 
were significant.
RESULTS
Sample demographics
During the period when the study took place, 
the total GP membership giving a working 
address in England was 47 761. Of these, 
11 654 GPs visited the DNUK website on 
at least a weekly basis. A total of 1415 GPs 
accepted the invitation to take part in the 
survey. Of these, 289 were excluded for not 
fully completing the questionnaire. A further 
46 were then excluded for either providing 
contradictory answers in the survey (for 
example, reporting that they were both 
familiar and unfamiliar with guidelines), or if 
their answers indicated that they no longer 
met the criteria for inclusion, and 67 were 
unable to take part as their regional quota 
had already been met. The final analysis 
included 1013 responses. 
Most responders were male (57%, 
n = 581), GP partners (61%, n = 620), aged 
between 30 and 39 years (36%, n = 369), 
working in a practice with six GPs (range 
1–30), had a patient population of 8994 
(range 500 to 40 000), based in London 
(12%, n = 120), in an urban area (42%, 
n = 429), did not take an active part in their 
clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) (61%,

 n = 613), and did not work in a dispensing 
practice (82%, n = 830). The mean year of 
qualification from medical school was 1995 
(range 1968 to 2010).
Overall awareness of the national 
guidelines
Of the GPs who responded, 20% (n = 198) 
were broadly or very familiar with the 
national PA guidelines (Figure 1), whereas 
30% (n = 301) had not heard of the guidelines, 
and 51% (n = 514) said that they had heard of 
them but were broadly unfamiliar or very 
unfamiliar with their content. The survey 
asked specifically about the guidelines, 
rather than guidance that referenced them 
(for example, NICE guidelines), in order 
to understand the knowledge confidence 
around the age-specific recommendations 
for PA.
Awareness of the tools available to 
support the guidelines
In all, 70% (n = 705) of GPs were aware of the 
GPPAQ, but 26% (n = 266) were not familiar 
with any tools at all (Figure 2). There was a 
statistically significant difference (P = 0.03) 
in knowledge of tools between those who 
were aware of the national guidelines and 
those who were not. Although 40% (n = 401) 
reported that they actually used GPPAQ in 
their clinical practice, 55% (n = 560) said 
that they did not use any tools at all. The 
percentage of GPs who were aware of 
and using GPPAQ was statistically higher 
(P = 0.04) among GPs who also said that they 
were familiar with the national guidelines. 
Conversely, those who were not aware of the 
CMO guidelines were also less likely to know 
about or use any tools (P = 0.04).
Understanding how to use PA tools
In general, 41% (n = 406) of GPs had a 
moderate or high level of understanding of 
PA measuring tools, but only 8% (n = 84) 
had a high level of understanding on how 
to implement GPPAQ specifically (Figure 
3). Those who were more familiar with the 
national guidelines were more likely to 
have greater understanding and be more 
confident in discussing PA with patients.
Confidence in raising the issue of PA in 
consultations
In all, 43% (n = 439) of GPs were somewhat 
confident in raising the issue of PA with 
a patient, whereas 16% (n = 165) were 
either somewhat or very unconfident. 
Unsurprisingly, 
almost 
double 
the 
proportion of doctors in the group who were 
not familiar with the guidelines reported 
being unconfident when raising the issue 
with patients, compared with those in the 
group who were familiar
.
Training on the use of tools and 
interventions to support increased PA
A total of 55% (n = 555) of GPs reported that 
they had not undertaken any training with 
respect to encouraging PA. Of those who 
had received some training, 20% (n = 202) 
were trained in use of the GPPAQ, and 
18% (n = 180) had received training on how 
to deliver brief interventions to encourage 
patient PA.

 (n = 151) of clinicians familiar with the 
national guidelines reported that they would 
recommend PA to patients with diagnosed 
cancer (Table 1). This is interesting, as 
there has been a sustained campaign by 
Macmillan Cancer Support (the UK’s leading 
source of cancer support) to promote PA.27 
Clinicians not familiar with the national 
guidelines were significantly (P = 0.05) 
less likely to advise PA to patients with a 
multitude of disorders (Table 1).
Awareness in different types of GPs
Awareness of both the guidelines and 
GPPAQ increased as practice size increased 
(P = 0.04), but levels of use of GPPAQ 
remained broadly similar
. This may reflect 
the greater diversity of practitioners in larger 
practices. Locum GPs were less likely to be 
aware of GPPAQ than either GP partners or 
salaried GPs, but level of use was similar 
(P = 0.02) (Figure 4). A larger proportion 
of the salaried GPs and GP registrars 
reported specific training on PA than 
partners or locum GPs (Table 2). In addition, 
practitioners in age groups 30–39 years and 
40–49 years were more likely to be aware 
of PA assessment tools than those in age 
groups 50–59 years or ≥60 years.
DISCUSSION
Summary
This study suggests that the majority of 
GPs are unfamiliar with the national PA 
guidelines. Predictably, those more familiar 
with the guidelines reported increased 
confidence in raising the issue with patients, 
as well as increased understanding and 
use of PA tools in a clinical setting. Many of 
those not familiar, however, did have some

 awareness of the existence of PA tools, 
especially the GPPAQ. Although the GPPAQ 
is an internationally validated tool, this study 
reflected a complex relationship where 
awareness was much higher than use. The 
cause of this is multifactorial, with limited 
consultation time, time constraints due to 
complex presenting problems, inadequate 
training, and perceptions of poor patient 
compliance being some of the reasons.22
Up until 2014–2015 there was a financial 
incentive to primary care in England to 
use GPPAQ to record patient PA under 
the hypertension Quality and Outcomes 
Framework (QOF).10 Potentially, removal of 
this incentive may have impacted on use of 
the GPPAQ, as studies have demonstrated 
that inclusion of a health parameter within 
a QOF leads to an improvement in care.28 
Conversely, the GPPAQ was only included 
in the QOF for 1 year, and so the effect of 
incentivisation is not fully known.
The results imply that the lack of skills, 
knowledge, and confidence in the guidelines 
may have been due to most responders not 
having had any form of training.
Strengths and limitations
The anonymity of responders encouraged 
participants to answer the questions 
honestly. However, some GPs may have 
struggled to admit lack of confidence in 
raising issues of PA, even to themselves, 
and therefore answers may not be truly 
reflective. GPs who were PA enthusiasts 
were more likely to participate in the

 survey. Therefore, this study may have 
underestimated the level of unfamiliarity of 
the CMO PA guidelines among all GPs.
Study limitations included a lack of GPs 
in training among responders. Younger 
participants appeared to be more familiar 
with guidelines, and more knowledgeable 
and confident when using PA tools and so, 
if more of the responders were doctors in 
training, this may have been reflected in 
the overall trends. Nurses and healthcare 
assistants, rather than GPs, conduct much 
of the preventive screening of patients in 
general practice. Thus, a major limitation 
of this study is that this group of individuals 
was not included.
Comparison with existing literature
There are several patient-centred studies 
that have investigated awareness of 
PA guidelines, beliefs about activity, 
and reasons for non-participation in 
exercise.19–21 However, there is only limited 
literature available on knowledge of PA 
measurement tools and guidelines by 
healthcare professionals. These papers are 
low powered, with relatively small sample 
sizes and are only regionally based.22–24 To 
the authors’ knowledge, this study is the 
first nationwide survey to comprehensively 
assess knowledge, use, and confidence in 
PA guidelines and tools of GPs.
Implications for research and practice
The knowledge and skills deficit identified 
by this study needs to be addressed in both 
undergraduate and postgraduate education, 
with more emphasis being put on PA in the 
clinical curriculum. Some provisions already 
exist that aim to improve GP knowledge 
on PA modification. One such scheme is 
the peer-to-peer PA clinical champions 
teaching programme. This service, created 
and provided by PHE, provides free 
structured training to health professionals 
by health professionals, to improve the 
understanding of PA in clinical practice so 
they can integrate very brief advice into 
their day-to-day clinical practice.29 To date, 
there have been six pilot regions focusing on 
doctors. The scheme is now being rolled out 
across the country, and expanded to allied 
health professionals. This is significant as, in 
the context of current pressures on general 
practice, the time required to even briefly 
discuss PA interventions is more likely to 
be available to the practice nurse or other 
members of the practice team than the GP
. 
Another teaching tool available is the 
online BMJ learning tool on ‘physical activity 
in the treatment of long-term conditions’.30 
This is comprised of nine e-learning modules 
on PA and health, plus a motivational 
interviewing module. Only 2% and 3% of total 
responders in this survey had undertaken 
either of these sessions, respectively. More 
needs to be done to increase GP awareness 
of these and other training opportunities. 
Given the potential gain in both patient and 
population outcomes, PA is an area that 
is ripe for exploration in both primary and 
secondary care. Further research is needed 
to understand how to maximise GPPAQ use 
for routine consultation to assess health risk 
and improvement in PA among patients.
