Tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable disease and 
death in the United States; if current smoking rates continue, 
5.6 million Americans aged <18 years who are alive today are 
projected to die prematurely from smoking-related disease (1). 
Tobacco use and addiction mostly begin during youth and young 
adulthood (1,2). CDC and the Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) analyzed data from the 2011–2015 National Youth 
Tobacco Surveys (NYTS) to determine the prevalence and 
trends of current (past 30-day) use of seven tobacco product 
types (cigarettes, cigars, smokeless tobacco, electronic cigarettes 
[e-cigarettes], hookahs [water pipes used to smoke tobacco], pipe 
tobacco, and bidis [small imported cigarettes wrapped in a tendu 
leaf]) among U.S. middle (grades 6–8) and high (grades 9–12) 
school students. In 2015, e-cigarettes were the most commonly 
used tobacco product among middle (5.3%) and high (16.0%) 
school students. During 2011–2015, significant increases in cur-
rent use of e-cigarettes and hookahs occurred among middle and 
high school students, whereas current use of conventional tobacco 
products, such as cigarettes and cigars decreased, resulting in no 
change in overall tobacco product use. During 2014–2015, cur-
rent use of e-cigarettes increased among middle school students, 
whereas current use of hookahs decreased among high school 
students; in contrast, no change was observed in use of hookahs 
among middle school students, use of e-cigarettes among high 
school students, or use of cigarettes, cigars, smokeless tobacco, 
pipe tobacco, or bidis among middle and high school students. In 
2015, an estimated 4.7 million middle and high school students 
were current tobacco product users, and, therefore, continue to 
be exposed to harmful tobacco product constituents, including 
nicotine. Nicotine exposure during adolescence, a critical period 
for brain development, can cause addiction, might harm brain 
development, and could lead to sustained tobacco product use 
among youths (1,3). Comprehensive and sustained strategies are 
warranted to prevent and reduce the use of all tobacco products 
among U.S. youths.
The NYTS is a cross-sectional, school-based, self-administered, 
pencil-and-paper questionnaire administered to U.S. middle 
school and high school students. Information is collected on 
tobacco control outcome indicators to monitor the impact of com-
prehensive tobacco control policies and strategies (4) and to inform 
the FDA’s regulatory actions (5). A three-stage cluster sampling

procedure was used to generate a nationally representative sample 
of U.S. students attending public and private schools in grades 
6–12. This report uses data from 5 years of NYTS (2011–2015). 
Sample sizes and overall response rates for 2011, 2012, 2013, 
2014, and 2015 were 18,866 (72.7%), 24,658 (73.6%), 18,406 
(67.8%), 22,007 (73.3%), and 17,711 (63.4%), respectively.
Participants were asked about current (past 30-day) use of ciga-
rettes, cigars, smokeless tobacco,* e-cigarettes,† hookahs,§ pipe 
tobacco,¶ and bidis. Current use for each product was defined 
as use on ≥1 day during the past 30 days. Current tobacco use 
was categorized as “any tobacco product use,” defined as use 
of one or more tobacco products in the past 30 days; and “≥2 
tobacco product use,” defined as use of two or more tobacco 
products in the past 30 days.** Kreteks (sometimes referred to 
as clove cigarettes) are no longer legally sold in the United States, 
and were excluded from the definition of current any tobacco 
product use, consistent with other recent reports.†† Data were 
weighted to account for the complex survey design and adjusted 
for nonresponse; national prevalence estimates with 95% con-
fidence intervals and population estimates rounded down to 
the nearest 10,000 were computed. Estimates for current use 
in 2015 are presented for any tobacco product use, use of ≥2 
tobacco products, and use of each tobacco product, by selected 
* The definition of smokeless tobacco in this report includes chewing tobacco/
snuff/dip, snus, and dissolvable tobacco because of limited sample sizes. The 
definition of smokeless tobacco in previously published NYTS reports included 
only chewing tobacco/snuff/dip, whereas snus and dissolvable tobacco were 
reported as separate products.
† In 2015, current use of e-cigarettes was assessed by the question “During the 
past 30 days, on how many days did you use electronic cigarettes or e-cigarettes.” 
E-cigarette questions were preceded by an introductory paragraph: “The next 
twelve questions are about electronic cigarettes or e-cigarettes. E-cigarettes are 
electronic devices that usually contain a nicotine-based liquid that is vaporized 
and inhaled. You may also know them as vape-pens, hookah-pens, electronic 
hookahs (e-hookahs), electronic cigars (e-cigars), electronic pipes (e-pipes), or 
e-vaporizers. Some look like cigarettes and others look like pens or small pipes. 
These are battery-powered devices that produce vapor instead of smoke. Some 
brands examples are NJOY, Blu, VUSE, MarkTen, Finiti, Starbuzz, and 
Fantasia.” In 2014, current use of e-cigarettes was assessed by the question 
“During the past 30 days, on how many days did you use e-cigarettes such as 
Blu, 21st Century Smoke, or NJOY?”; and in 2011 to 2013, e-cigarette use 
was assessed by the question “In the past 30 days, which of the following 
products have you used on at least one day?,” and the response option for 
e-cigarettes was “Electronic cigarettes or e-cigarettes such as Ruyan or NJOY.”
§ In 2015, current use of hookahs was assessed by the question “In the past 
30 days, which of the following products have you used on at least one day?” 
and was the fourth response option available to be selected; in 2014, hookah 
use was the first response option; whereas from 2011 to 2013, hookah was the 
fourth or fifth response option.
 ¶ In 2014 and 2015, current use of tobacco pipes was assessed by the question 
“In the past 30 days, which of the following products have you used on at 
least one day?” and the response option for pipe tobacco was “Pipe filled with 
tobacco (not waterpipe).” From 2011 to 2013, tobacco pipe use was assessed 
by the question “During the past 30 days, on how many days did you smoke 
tobacco in a pipe?”
 
** The definition of ≥2 tobacco product use includes the updated definition of 
smokeless tobacco, thereby analyzing chewing tobacco/snuff/dip, snus, and 
dissolvable tobacco as a single tobacco product type compared with previously 
published NYTS reports, which analyzed chewing tobacco/snuff/dip, snus, 
and dissolvable tobacco as separate products.
 
†† Kreteks are no longer legally sold in the United States; therefore, data on these 
products were not collected in the 2014 and 2015 cycles of NYTS. Also, 
kreteks were not included in the definition of “any tobacco product use” in 
years when data were collected to assess trends across the study period (2011, 
2012, and 2013).

demographics for each school level (high and middle). Results 
were assessed for the presence of linear and quadratic trends to 
determine the overall trend present, adjusting for race/ethnicity, 
sex, and grade; p-value <0.05 was used to determine statistical 
significance.§§ T-tests were performed to examine differences 
between estimates from 2014 and 2015; p-values <0.05 were 
considered statistically significant.
In 2015, 25.3% of high school students reported current 
use of any tobacco product, including 13.0% who reported 
current use of ≥2 tobacco products. Among all high school 
students, e-cigarettes (16.0%) were the most commonly used 
tobacco product, followed by cigarettes (9.3%), cigars (8.6%), 
hookahs (7.2%), smokeless tobacco (6.0%), pipe tobacco 
(1.0%), and bidis (0.6%) (Table). Males reported higher use 
of any tobacco, ≥2 tobacco products, e-cigarettes, cigarettes, 
cigars, smokeless tobacco, and bidis than did females. Among 
non-Hispanic white and Hispanic high school students, 
e-cigarettes were the most commonly used tobacco product, 
whereas among non-Hispanic black high school students, 
cigars were most commonly used. Cigarette use was higher 
among non-Hispanic whites than among non-Hispanic blacks; 
and smokeless tobacco use was higher among non-Hispanic 
whites than other races.
Among middle school students, current use of any tobacco 
product and ≥2 tobacco products was 7.4% and 3.3%, respec-
tively (Table). E-cigarettes (5.3%) were the most commonly 
used tobacco product by middle school students, followed by 
cigarettes (2.3%), hookahs (2.0%), smokeless tobacco (1.8%), 
cigars (1.6%), pipe tobacco (0.4%), and bidis (0.2%). As was 
the case among high school students, male middle school 
students reported higher use of any tobacco product than did 
females. Hispanic middle school students reported higher use 
of any tobacco product, use of ≥2 tobacco products, and use 
of e-cigarettes compared with that of other races/ethnicities.
During 2014–2015, current use of hookahs declined among 
high school students. Use of all other tobacco products, 
including e-cigarettes, cigarettes, cigars, and smokeless tobacco 
remained unchanged during this time period among high 
school students. Among middle school students, e-cigarette 
use increased from 3.9% in 2014 to 5.3% in 2015. Use of 
other tobacco products, including cigarettes, cigars, hookahs, 
and smokeless tobacco remained unchanged.
During 2011–2015, among all high school students, 
significant nonlinear increases were observed for current 
use of e-cigarettes (1.5% to 16.0%) and hookahs (4.1% to 
7.2%) (Figure 1). Significant linear decreases were observed 
for current use of cigarettes (15.8% to 9.3%) and smokeless 
tobacco (7.9% to 6.0%), and significant nonlinear decreases 
were observed for current use of cigars (11.6% to 8.6%), pipe 
tobacco (4.0% to 1.0%), and bidis (2.0% to 0.6%). Current 
use of any tobacco product (24.2% to 25.3%) did not change 
significantly during 2011–2015. Among middle school stu-
dents, significant linear increases were observed for current 
use of e-cigarettes (0.6% to 5.3%) and hookahs (1.0% to 
2.0%) (Figure 2). Significant linear decreases were observed 
for current use of cigarettes (4.3% to 2.3%), cigars (3.5% to 
1.6%), and smokeless tobacco (2.7% to 1.8%), and signifi-
cant nonlinear decreases were observed for current use of pipe 
tobacco (2.2% to 0.4%) and bidis (1.7% to 0.2%). There was 
also a significant nonlinear change in the percentage of middle 
school students reporting current use of ≥2 tobacco products.
In 2015, an estimated 4.7 million middle and high school 
students were current users of any tobacco product, over 
2.3 million of whom were current users of ≥2 tobacco prod-
ucts. Among middle and high school current tobacco users, 
 
§§ A test for linear trend is significant if an overall statistically significant decrease 
or increase occurs during the study period. Data were also assessed for the 
presence of quadratic trends; a significant quadratic trend indicates that the 
rate of change accelerated or decelerated across the study period. Trends were 
only assessed when statistically stable data were available for all 5 years. A 
significant positive linear trend and nonsignificant quadratic trend signifies 
the presence of a linear increase; a significant negative linear trend and 
nonsignificant quadratic trends signifies the presence of a linear decrease; a 
significant positive linear trend and significant positive or negative quadratic 
trend signifies the presence of a nonlinear increase; a significant negative linear 
trend and significant positive or negative quadratic trend signifies the presence 
of a nonlinear decrease; a nonsignificant linear trend and significant positive 
or negative quadratic trend signifies the presence of a nonlinear change.
Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Tobacco use and addiction mostly begin during youth and 
young adulthood. Nicotine exposure during adolescence can 
cause addiction, might harm brain development, and could 
lead to sustained tobacco product use among youths.
What is added by this report?
In 2015, one in four high school students and one in 13 middle 
school students reported current use of any tobacco product 
(≥1 day in the past 30 days). An estimated 4.7 million high 
school and middle school students reported current use of any 
tobacco product. During 2011–2015, substantial increases were 
observed in e-cigarette and hookah use among high school and 
middle school students, whereas significant decreases were 
observed in the use of cigarettes, cigars, smokeless tobacco, 
pipe tobacco, and bidis, resulting in no decline in tobacco use 
overall. During 2015, electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) were 
the most commonly used tobacco product among middle 
(5.3%) and high (16.0%) school students.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Use of emerging tobacco products, including e-cigarettes, is on the 
rise among middle and high school students; therefore, it is critical 
that comprehensive tobacco control and prevention strategies for 
youths address all tobacco products and not just cigarettes.

Discussion
During 2011–2015, there was no change in current use of 
any tobacco product among middle and high school students, 
and in 2015, an estimated 4.7 million U.S. middle and high 
school students currently used any tobacco product. As in 
2014, e-cigarettes were the most used tobacco product among 
U.S. middle and high school students in 2015. During 2011–
2015, substantial increases in current e-cigarette use among 
middle and high school students were reported, resulting in an 
estimated total of 3.0 million middle school and high school 
e-cigarette users in 2015. Although the use of cigarettes and 
cigars declined during 2011–2015, there was no change in 
use of these products during 2014–2015, making cigarettes 
(1.6 million) and cigars (1.4 million) the second and third 
most commonly used tobacco products among youths in 2015.
Tobacco prevention and control strategies, including increas-
ing tobacco product prices, adopting comprehensive smoke-
free laws, and implementation of national public education 
media campaigns, likely have contributed to the reduction in 
use of certain tobacco products, including cigarettes, among 
youths in recent years (2). However, the lack of decline in use 
of cigarettes and cigars from 2014 to 2015 is concerning, as 
approximately 80% of adult smokers first try smoking by age 
18 years (2). Furthermore, because of increases in the use of

 *  Past 30-day use of cigarettes was determined by asking, “During the past 30 days, on how many days did you smoke cigarettes?”; Past 30-day use of cigars was 
determined by asking, “During the past 30 days, on how many days did you smoke cigars, cigarillos, or little cigars?”; Smokeless tobacco was defined as use of 
chewing tobacco/snuff/dip, snus, and/or dissolvable tobacco. Past 30-day use of smokeless tobacco was determined by asking the following question for use of 
chewing tobacco/snuff/dip: “During the past 30 days, on how many days did you use chewing tobacco, snuff, or dip?,” and the following question for use of snus 
and dissolvable tobacco: “In the past 30 days, which of the following products have you used on at least one day?,” and combining responses together to derive 
use. Past 30-day use of electronic cigarettes was determined by asking, “During the past 30 days, on how many days did use electronic cigarettes or e–cigarettes?”; 
past 30-day use of hookahs, pipe tobacco (not hookah), and bidis, were determined by asking, “In the past 30 days, which of the following products have you used 
on at least one day?”

emerging tobacco products, including e-cigarettes, no decline 
occurred in tobacco use overall during 2011–2015.
The findings in this report are subject to at least four limi-
tations. First, NYTS only recruited middle and high school 
students from public and private schools in the United States; 
therefore, the findings might not be generalizable to youths 
who are being home-schooled, have dropped out of school, 
or are in detention centers. Second, data were self-reported; 
thus, the findings are subject to recall and response bias. Third, 
current tobacco use was estimated among students reporting 
their use status for at least one of the seven tobacco products 
included in the survey, whereas students with missing responses 
were considered nonusers of that product, which would result 
in conservative estimates. Finally, changes in the wording and 
placement of survey questions about the use of certain prod-
ucts (e.g., e-cigarettes, hookahs, and pipe tobacco) within the 
2011–2015 period might have had an impact on reported 
use of these products; however, this possibility is difficult to 
assess because usage patterns were changing during this time 
period. Despite these limitations, overall trends are generally 
similar to other nationally representative surveys of tobacco 
use among youths (6,7).
Sustained efforts to implement proven tobacco control 
policies and strategies are necessary to prevent youth use of all 
tobacco products. In April 2014, FDA issued a proposed rule, 
which when finalized, would give FDA jurisdiction over prod-
ucts made or derived from tobacco, including e-cigarettes, some 
or all cigars, pipe tobacco, and hookah tobacco (8). Regulation 
of the manufacturing, distribution, and marketing of tobacco 
products by FDA, coupled with full implementation of com-
prehensive tobacco control and prevention strategies at CDC-
recommended funding levels (9) could reduce youth tobacco

initiation and use (1,2,9). Given that the use of e-cigarettes is 
on the rise among middle and high school students and nico-
tine exposure from any source is dangerous for youths (2), it 
is critical that comprehensive tobacco control and prevention 
strategies for youths address all tobacco products and not just 
cigarettes. In addition, rapid changes in use of conventional 
and emerging tobacco products among youths, and varying 
prevalence of certain tobacco products by population groups 
underscore the importance of enhanced surveillance of all 
forms of tobacco product use among U.S. youths.
