O
ut-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is a major public 
health problem, affecting ≈420 000 individuals in the 
United States1 and 110 000 individuals in Japan annually.2 
Despite decades of efforts to promote resuscitation, neuro-
logically intact survival rates for OHCA remains low world-
wide.3–9 Frequently, resuscitation efforts are unsuccessful and 
death occurs.4 Achievement of return of spontaneous circula-
tion (ROSC) is a prerequisite for neurologically intact survival, 
and it may be appropriate to extend resuscitation efforts if 
ROSC might occur. Recent resuscitation guidelines state that 
end-of-life decision making is an important component of 
resuscitation3–9 and recommend the following termination of 
resuscitation (TOR) rules for basic life support (BLS) in adult 
Background—During out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, it is unclear how long prehospital resuscitation efforts should be 
continued to maximize lives saved.
Methods and Results—Between 2005 and 2012, we enrolled 282 183 adult patients with bystander-witnessed out-of-hospital 
cardiac arrest from the All-Japan Utstein Registry. Prehospital resuscitation duration was calculated as the time interval 
from call receipt to return of spontaneous circulation in cases achieving prehospital return of spontaneous circulation 
or from call receipt to hospital arrival in cases not achieving prehospital return of spontaneous circulation. In each of 4 
groups stratified by initial cardiac arrest rhythm (shockable versus nonshockable) and bystander resuscitation (presence 
versus absence), we calculated minimum prehospital resuscitation duration, defined as the length of resuscitation efforts in 
minutes required to achieve ≥99% sensitivity for the primary end point, favorable 30-day neurological outcome after out-
of-hospital cardiac arrest. Prehospital resuscitation duration to achieve prehospital return of spontaneous circulation ranged 
from 1 to 60 minutes. Longer prehospital resuscitation duration reduced the likelihood of favorable neurological outcome 
(adjusted odds ratio, 0.84; 95% confidence interval, 0.838–0.844). Although the frequency of favorable neurological 
outcome was significantly different among the 4 groups, ranging from 20.0% (shockable/bystander resuscitation group) 
to 0.9% (nonshockable/bystander resuscitation group; P<0.001), minimum prehospital resuscitation duration did not 
differ widely among the 4 groups (40 minutes in the shockable/bystander resuscitation group and the shockable/no 
bystander resuscitation group, 44 minutes in the nonshockable/bystander resuscitation group, and 45 minutes in the 
nonshockable/no bystander resuscitation group).
Conclusions—On the basis of time intervals from the shockable arrest groups, prehospital resuscitation efforts should be 
continued for at least 40 minutes in all adults with bystander-witnessed out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.

OHCA patients: arrest not witnessed by emergency medi-
cal service (EMS) responders, no ROSC after 3 full rounds 
of BLS and automated external defibrillator (AED) analysis, 
and no AED shocks. The TOR rules for advanced life sup-
port (ALS) include the BLS criteria and 3 additional criteria: 
arrest not witnessed by bystander, no bystander resuscitation, 
and no ROSC after full ALS in the field. When all criteria are 
met before transport, resuscitation efforts can be terminated,4 
reducing BLS transport by 54% to 63%10,11 and ALS transport 
by 31%.11 However, these guidelines state only the mandatory 
elements of “adequate” resuscitation efforts and do not specify 
the minimum duration for resuscitation efforts.3–9 Recent stud-
ies of in-hospital cardiac arrest demonstrate that increasing 
the duration of resuscitation efforts improves the likelihood 
of survival.12,13 These findings suggest that clearly defining the 
length of prehospital resuscitation efforts is essential to opti-
mal implementation of TOR rules.
The EMS system in Japan is ideal for evaluating this 
question: EMS responders must start resuscitation efforts 
immediately for all OHCA patients except when the vic-
tim is obviously moribund; EMS responders must continue 
resuscitation efforts until achievement of ROSC or until 
hospital arrival, whichever comes first; and EMS respond-
ers cannot make the decision to terminate resuscitation 
efforts.2,5,14,15 We therefore assessed prehospital resuscita-
tion duration for neurologically intact survival in all adult 
patients with bystander-witnessed OHCA. We expected 
that prehospital resuscitation duration for neurologically 
intact survival would differ in 4 groups stratified by initial 
cardiac arrest rhythm (shockable versus nonshockable) and 
bystander resuscitation status (presence versus absence), 
with longer prehospital resuscitation duration produc-
ing more survivors in the 2 groups with the presence of 
bystander resuscitation.
Methods
Data Source and EMS System
The All-Japan Utstein Registry, a prospective, nationwide, pop-
ulation-based registry of OHCA, was established January 1, 
2005, by the Fire and Disaster Management Agency4–16 following 
the ethics guidelines in Japan17 and has been described in detail 
previously.14–16,18 All fire stations with dispatch centers and all 
collaborating medical institutions participate in the registry. A 
subcommittee of resuscitation science in the Japanese Circulation 
Society was provided with registry data following the prescribed 
governmental legal procedures and conducted the study with 
approval from the ethics committee at Surugadai Nihon University 
Hospital.18 Japan had a population of 127 million in 2011. There 
are 802 municipally governed fire stations with dispatch centers 
operating around the clock, following uniform guideline-based 
resuscitation protocols.14 Each ambulance has 3 EMS respond-
ers, including at least 1 emergency lifesaving technician certified 
to insert intravenous lines and adjunct airways. Specially trained 
emergency lifesaving technicians are permitted to insert tracheal 
tubes and to administer intravenous epinephrine.14 All OHCA 
patients receiving prehospital resuscitation efforts are transported 
to the nearest emergency hospital.2,14–16,18

Study Population
Between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2012, adult patients with 
bystander-witnessed OHCA in whom EMS responders performed 
prehospital resuscitation care and who were transported to the hos-
pital were included. Exclusion criteria were age <18 years, cardiac 
arrest after EMS responder arrival, unwitnessed OHCA, unidentified 
witness status, unidentified initial cardiac arrest rhythm, unidentified 
bystander resuscitation status, and a “do not resuscitate” order.
Data Collection
Data elements were collected prospectively on the basis of the 
Utstein guidelines.19 Estimated times of collapse and initiation of 
bystander resuscitation were obtained from bystanders. All event 
times were synchronized by the dispatch center clock.2,14–16,18 EMS 
responders documented the presence or absence of bystander 
resuscitation efforts and noted bystander resuscitation technique, 
classified as documented chest compressions with or without res-
cue breathings or unidentified resuscitation technique (change of 
technique, resuscitation without documented chest compressions, 
etc).2,14–16,18,20 The initial cardiac arrest rhythm was classified as 
shockable (ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycar-
dia) or nonshockable (pulseless electric activity or asystole) on the 
basis of AED analysis.2,14–16,18 Patients receiving bystander-delivered 
shocks with a public-access AED were classified as having a shock-
able arrest.14–16 Prehospital ROSC was defined as any spontaneous 
palpable pulse confirmed by cardiac rhythm monitoring occurring 
before hospital arrival.2,14–16,18,20 Causes of arrest were determined 
clinically by the physicians in charge after hospital arrival and 
defined as presumed cardiac cause unless an obvious noncardiac 
cause was elicited.2,14–16,18–20 Resuscitation outcomes were collected 
by the receiving hospital physicians in collaboration with EMS 
responders.2,14–16,18 For patients discharged from the hospital alive, 
neurological outcomes were determined during 30-day follow-up 
interviews2,14–16,18 with the use of the Cerebral Performance Category 
scale.19 The data form was filled out by the EMS personnel in coop-
eration with the physicians in charge of the patients, and the data 
were integrated into the registry system on the Fire and Disaster 
Management Agency database server and then logically checked by 
the computer system. If the data form was incomplete, the Fire and

End Points
The primary end point was favorable 30-day neurological outcome, 
defined as a Cerebral Performance Category 1 (good performance) or 
2 (moderate disability) on a 5-category scale.19 Cerebral Performance 
Category 3 (severe disability), 4 (vegetative state), and 5 (death) 
were regarded as unfavorable neurological outcome. The secondary 
end points were prehospital ROSC and 30-day survival (Cerebral 
Performance Category 1–4).
Statistical Methods
The prehospital resuscitation duration, inclusive of EMS responder 
resuscitation efforts with or without bystander resuscitation efforts, 
was calculated as the call-receipt-to-ROSC interval in cases achiev-
ing prehospital ROSC or the call-receipt-to-hospital-arrival interval 
in cases not achieving prehospital ROSC. The resuscitation duration 
provided exclusively by EMS responders was calculated as the scene-
arrival-to-ROSC interval in cases achieving prehospital ROSC or the 
scene-arrival-to-hospital-arrival interval in cases not achieving pre-
hospital ROSC.
The study cohort was divided into 4 groups according to ini-
tial cardiac arrest rhythm (shockable versus nonshockable) and 
bystander resuscitation status (documented chest compressions 
with or without rescue breathings versus no bystander resuscita-
tion). Baseline characteristics and study outcomes were compared 
by use of the χ2 test for categorical variables and the Mann-
Whitney U test or the Kruskal-Wallis rank test for continuous 
variables. We graphed the distributions of prehospital resuscita-
tion duration using stacked bars in the entire study cohort strati-
fied by prehospital ROSC status. On the basis of the distribution 
of prehospital resuscitation duration to achieve prehospital ROSC, 
the following analyses were done in the subset of patients with 
≤60 minutes of prehospital resuscitation duration. We graphed 
the cumulative rates of 30-day neurological outcomes and favor-
able 30-day neurological outcome. A multiple logistic-regression 
analysis was performed for independent predictors of favorable 
30-day neurological outcome, including prehospital resuscita-
tion duration, age, study period (year the arrest occurred), sex, 
bystander resuscitation status, initial cardiac arrest rhythm, ALS, 
and cause of cardiac arrest. In each group stratified by initial 
cardiac arrest rhythm and bystander resuscitation status, curve 
estimation in a quadratic model was used to illustrate the relation-
ship between the prehospital resuscitation duration and favorable 
30-day neurological outcome. We calculated the sensitivity and 
negative predictive values of the prehospital and EMS responder 
resuscitation durations for having favorable 30-day neurological 
outcome in each group. Consistent with previous studies for the 
TOR rules,10,11,21,22 a sensitivity of ≥99% for favorable 30-day neu-
rological outcome was used to determine the minimum prehospital 
and EMS responder resuscitation durations; we also calculated the 
maximum prehospital and EMS responder resuscitation durations 
associated with a sensitivity of 100% and a negative predictive 
value of 100%. Compared with previous sample sizes (1240–
13 684 patients10,11,21,22), our larger sample size (283 183 patients) 
provided >80% power (1-side α=0.05) with a misclassification 
rate <1%. All statistical analyses were performed with SPSS soft-
ware (version 16.0J).

Results
Patient Characteristics
Of the 925 288 OHCA victims between 2005 and 2012, 
910 581 (98.4%) had prehospital resuscitation attempts and 
were transported to the hospital (Figure 1). Of these, 628 398 
were excluded. This study included 282 183 adult patients 
with bystander-witnessed OHCA: 23 028 (8.2%) shockable/
bystander resuscitation cases, 19 383 (6.9%) shockable/no 
bystander resuscitation cases, 104 212 (36.9%) nonshockable/
bystander resuscitation cases, and 135 560 (48.0%) nonshock-
able/no bystander resuscitation cases. Baseline characteristics 
and arrest factors exhibited significant differences between 
groups, including age, sex, intravenous fluid administration, 
and cardiac cause of the arrest (Table 1).

Outcomes
Frequencies of prehospital ROSC, 30-day survival, and favor-
able 30-day neurological outcome (Figure 1) were 31.0% 
(7140 of 23 028), 28.6% (6597 of 23 028), and 20.0% (4601 of 
23 026) in the shockable/bystander resuscitation group; 24.9% 
(4827 of 19 383), 23.0% (4452 of 19 383), and 13.2% (2556 
of 19 381) in the shockable/no bystander resuscitation group; 
8.7% (9038 of 104 212), 4.4% (4538 of 10 4211), and 0.9% 
(979 of 104 206) in the nonshockable/bystander resuscitation 
group; and 8.2% (11 180 of 135 560), 4.5% (6071 of 135 560), 
and 1.1% (1533 of 135 552) in the nonshockable/no bystander 
resuscitation group (P<0.001).
Prehospital and EMS Responder Resuscitation 
Durations
The prehospital resuscitation duration ranged from 1 to 60 
minutes in cases achieving prehospital ROSC and from 1 to 
120 minutes in cases not achieving prehospital ROSC (Figure 
2). In the subset of patients with ≤60 minutes of prehospital 
resuscitation duration (Figure 3A), 3.5% (9530 of 273 463) had 
favorable 30-day neurological outcome. Of the 9530 patients 
having favorable neurological outcome, 7924 (83.1%) were 
in cases achieving prehospital ROSC (Figure 3B). We found 
that only 0.7% (1606 of 241 943) of the cases not achieving 
prehospital ROSC went on to have favorable neurological 
outcome. Figure 4 shows a multiple logistic regression analy-
sis for favorable 30-day neurological outcome in the 273 463 
patients with ≤60 minutes of prehospital duration. Longer 
prehospital resuscitation duration reduced the likelihood of 
favorable neurological outcome (adjusted odds ratio, 0.84; 
95% confidence interval, 0.838–0.844; P<0.001). In curve 
estimation in a quadratic model of each group stratified by 
initial cardiac arrest rhythm and bystander resuscitation sta-
tus (Figure 5), the likelihood of favorable 30-day neurological 
outcome decreased for every minute that prehospital resusci-
tation efforts continued (R2=0.295–0.037; P<0.001). Table 2 
shows the sensitivities and negative predictive values of the 
prehospital resuscitation duration and the EMS responder

resuscitation duration for favorable 30-day neurological out-
come in each group stratified by initial cardiac arrest rhythm 
and bystander resuscitation status. Similar prehospital resus-
citation durations were necessary to achieve a sensitivity of 
≥99% for favorable 30-day neurological outcome (minimum) 
in each of the 4 groups (40 minutes in the shockable/bystander 
resuscitation and the shockable/no bystander resuscitation 
group, 44 minutes in the nonshockable/bystander resuscita-
tion group, and 45 minutes in the nonshockable/no bystander 
resuscitation group). To achieve a sensitivity and negative 
predictive value of 100% (maximum), concordant prehospital 
resuscitation durations were needed in the 4 groups, ranging 
from 56 to 59 minutes. Moreover, similar results were found 
for the EMS responder resuscitation durations, with the mini-
mum ranging from 33 to 39 minutes and the maximum rang-
ing from 51 to 55 minutes.
Discussion
Since 1992, all resuscitation guidelines have stated that early 
access, early BLS, early defibrillation, and early ALS are 
essential components of a series of actions designed to reduce 
the mortality associated with cardiac arrest.3–9,19 We analyzed 
the prehospital resuscitation duration from call receipt, inclu-
sive of EMS responder resuscitation efforts with or without 
bystander resuscitation efforts, to determine the minimum 
period of prehospital resuscitation efforts to maximize good 
neurological outcomes. This nationwide, population-based 
study of prehospital resuscitation without implementation 
of TOR rules demonstrates that the prehospital resuscita-
tion duration for favorable 30-day neurological outcome did 
not differ widely among 4 groups stratified by initial cardiac 
arrest rhythm and bystander resuscitation status, with the 
minimum, to achieve ≥99% sensitivity, ranging from 40 to 
45 minutes and the maximum, to achieve 100% sensitivity 
and 100% negative predictive value, ranging from 56 to 58 
minutes. Furthermore, similar results were found for the EMS 
responder resuscitation duration, with the minimum ranging 
from 33 to 39 minutes and the maximum ranging from 51 to 
55 minutes. These findings suggest that prehospital resuscita-
tion efforts should be continued for at least 40 minutes from 
call receipt, including at least 33 minutes of EMS responder 
resuscitation efforts from scene arrival, in all adult patients 
with bystander-witnessed OHCA.
In 2000, the national association of EMS physicians 
standards and clinical practice committee suggested that 
EMS responder resuscitation efforts could be terminated in 
patients who do not respond to 20 to 30 minutes of ALS.23 
However, our study suggests that prehospital resuscitation 
efforts, inclusive of EMS responder resuscitation efforts, can 
be continued for longer intervals with the possibility of suc-
cess than previous thought. Several factors might account 
for longer durations of prehospital resuscitation efforts 
being associated with successful resuscitation in our study. 
Since 2000, the resuscitation protocols have been revised 4 
times.3–9 Our previous study revealed a significant increase 
in neurologically intact survival, from 2.1% in 2005 to 4.3% 
in 2009 for bystander-witnessed OHCA,2 suggesting that the 
overall quality of resuscitation care, inclusive of the incre-
ment of bystander resuscitation with or without public-access 
AED2,16,17,20 and post–cardiac arrest care,24 has improved. 
Similar results were shown in this study. In 2012, Goldberger 
et al12 demonstrated that patients with cardiac arrest occur-
ring in hospitals where the median length of resuscitation 
efforts was longer were more likely to survive to discharge 
than those in hospitals where the median length of resusci-
tation efforts was shorter. In-hospital resuscitation duration 
ranged from 1 to 60 minutes for 31 198 patients achieving 
ROSC. In our study, the range of prehospital resuscitation 
duration to achieve prehospital ROSC was similar; however, 
frequencies of favorable 30-day neurological outcome were

lower. Possible explanations for these findings include dif-
ferences in characteristics between the 2 study populations, 
more rapid deployment of high-quality resuscitation during 
in-hospital arrest, and improved access to high-quality post–
cardiac arrest care in the in-hospital setting. Regardless, our 
findings suggest that high-quality resuscitation care expands 
the length of prehospital resuscitation efforts that produce 
favorable neurological outcomes, similar to the findings for 
in-hospital arrests.
In the 2010 resuscitation guidelines, the TOR rules 
included no ROSC after 3 full rounds of BLS or no ROSC 
after full ALS before transport.4 In 2013, Reynolds et al25 
reported EMS responder resuscitation duration under the 
TOR rules. They showed that 90% of the neurologically 
intact survivors had achieved prehospital ROSC within 16.1 
minutes of EMS responder resuscitation duration. However, 
57.5% (3168 of 5517) of the OHCA patients met BLS 
TOR rules and did not receive EMS responder resuscitation

length of prehospital resuscitation efforts and the number of 
neurologically intact survivors.
The central question raised by this study is how long 
EMS responders should continue resuscitation efforts. This 
is a difficult question to answer because community systems 
of emergency care vary around the world, and ethical and 
cultural norms must be considered. It is clear that field ter-
mination reduces transport to the hospital,10,11,21–23,25,26 but the 
optimal prehospital resuscitation duration has not previously 
been established. Our results demonstrate that prehospital 
resuscitation efforts to achieve favorable neurological out-
come should be continued for at least 40 minutes from call 
receipt, inclusive of bystander and EMS responder resuscita-
tion efforts, and for at least 33 minutes from scene arrival 
for EMS responder resuscitation efforts exclusively. We 
believe that this study will help optimize treatment for OHCA 
patients to maximize the number of neurologically intact sur-
vivors of cardiac arrest and will inform the development of 
future TOR rules.
This study has several limitations. First, in all epidemio-
logical studies, data integrity, validity, and ascertainment bias 
are potential limitations. However, uniform data collection, a 
large sample size, and a population-based design covering all 
known OHCA in Japan minimize these potential sources of 
bias.2,16,18,26 Second, the time of call receipt was used as the 
time of first resuscitation care to calculate the prehospital 
resuscitation duration. Collapse or first bystander resuscita-
tion attempts might be better time indicators, but both are dif-
ficult to record accurately.3–5,19 If bystander resuscitation is not 
performed, the interval from call receipt to ROSC includes 
a period of no flow followed by a period of EMS responder 
resuscitation efforts. When bystander resuscitation is per-
formed, we have no way of knowing the percentage of the 
time from call receipt to EMS arrival; the bystanders actu-
ally performed resuscitation. However, we found similar 
lengths of time in all 4 groups when we analyzed the length 
of EMS responder resuscitation efforts exclusive of bystander 
attempts, suggesting that the presence of absence of bystander 
efforts does not substantially alter the time frame needed to 
maximize neurologically intact survivors. Furthermore, the 
time interval from call receipt to scene arrival is critical for 
survival.3–5 The time of scene arrival was used as the time of 
first EMS responder resuscitation care to calculate the EMS 
responder resuscitation duration. Arrival at patient’s side or 
first EMS responder resuscitation attempts might be better 
time indicators, but the time interval rushing to the patient’s 
side from scene arrival is an important part of EMS responder 
resuscitation efforts.19 Third, although the quality of resuscita-
tion affects neurological outcome,3–9,27,28 data on resuscitation 
quality were lacking. Fourth, information on ongoing resusci-
tation efforts after hospital arrival was lacking. We provided 
data demonstrating that 16.9% of patients who had favorable 
neurological outcomes achieved ROSC after hospital arrival; 
however, <1% of all patients who did not achieve prehospi-
tal ROSC went on to have favorable neurological outcome. 
Our analysis of this subgroup is limited because we do not 
have information about whether these patients received epi-
nephrine or further defibrillation or how long the resuscita-
tion effort was continued after hospital arrival. Fifth, details 
on post–cardiac arrest care3–9,24,29–33 and use of extracorporeal 
cardiopulmonary resuscitation34–36 were lacking. With broader 
adoption of these treatments, optimum length of the prehospi-
tal recitation efforts may need to be extended. Finally, neuro-
logical outcomes were measured at 30 days after OHCA, but 
some patients might recover more gradually. A recent consen-
sus statement acknowledged that optimal times for follow-up 
after OHCA have yet to be established. A 3-month postdis-
charge period would balance the opportunity for recovery 
with the number of patients lost to follow-up.37
Conclusions
On the basis of results from the 2 shockable arrest groups, 
prehospital resuscitation efforts should be continued for 
at least 40 minutes from call receipt, including at least 33 
minutes of EMS responder resuscitation efforts from scene 
arrival, in all adult patients with bystander-witnessed OHCA 
to achieve a ≥99% sensitivity of favorable 30-day neurologi-
cal outcome. The costs and benefits of prolonging prehospital 
resuscitation efforts must be taken into consideration when 
these results are translated into clinical practice, and further 
studies are needed.

CLINICAL PERSPECTIVE
Since 1992, all cardiopulmonary resuscitation guidelines have stated that the chain of survival (early access, early basic 
life support, early defibrillation, and early advanced cardiovascular life support) is an essential series of actions designed to 
reduce the mortality associated with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Recent cardiopulmonary resuscitation guidelines state 
that termination of resuscitation (TOR) rules are an important component of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, but TOR rules 
have not specified the minimum duration for prehospital resuscitation efforts. Furthermore, TOR rules are difficult to define 
objectively because community systems of emergency care vary around the world and ethical and cultural norms must be 
considered. It is clear that field termination reduces transport to the hospital, but the optimal prehospital cardiopulmonary 
resuscitation duration to maximize the number of patients with good neurological outcome has not previously been estab-
lished. From the All-Japan Utstein Registry, in which emergency medical service responders do not implement TOR rules, 
we demonstrate that prehospital resuscitation efforts to achieve favorable neurological outcome should be continued for at 
least 40 minutes from call receipt, inclusive of bystander and emergency medical service responder resuscitation efforts, 
and for at least 33 minutes from scene arrival for emergency medical service responder resuscitation efforts exclusively. We 
believe that this study will help optimize treatment for patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest to maximize the number of 
neurologically intact survivors of cardiac arrest and will inform the development of future TOR rules. The costs and benefits 
of prolonging prehospital resuscitation efforts must be taken into consideration when these results are translated into clinical 
practice, and further studies are needed.
