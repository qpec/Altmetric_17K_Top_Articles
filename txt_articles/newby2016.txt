The path to eradication: a progress report on the 
malaria-eliminating countries
Gretchen Newby, Adam Bennett, Erika Larson, Chris Cotter, Rima Shretta, Allison A Phillips, Richard G A Feachem
In the past several years, as worldwide morbidity and mortality due to malaria have continued to decrease, the global 
malaria community has grown increasingly supportive of the idea of malaria eradication. In 2015, three noteworthy 
global documents were released—the WHO’s Global Technical Strategy for Malaria 2016–2030, the Roll Back Malaria 
Partnership’s Action and Investment to defeat Malaria 2016–2030, and From Aspiration to Action: What Will It Take to 
End Malaria?—that collectively advocate for malaria elimination and eradication and outline key operational, technical, 
and fi
 nancial strategies to achieve progress toward malaria eradication. In light of this remarkable change in global 
attitudes toward malaria elimination and eradication, and as the malaria community debates how and when to embark 
on this ambitious goal, it is important to assess current progress along the path to eradication. Although low-income, 
high-burden countries are often the focus when discussing the substantial challenges of eradication, the progress 
toward elimination in middle-income, low-burden countries is a major driver of global progress and deserves better 
recognition. Additionally, although global support and guidance is essential for success, malaria elimination and 
eradication eff
 orts will ultimately be driven at the country level and achieved in a collaborative manner, region by region. 
In this Review, we examine the present status of the 35 malaria-eliminating countries, summarise existing national and 
regional elimination goals and the regional frameworks that support them, and identify the most crucial enabling 
factors and potential barriers to achieving eradication by a theoretical end date of 2040.
Introduction
For decades after the conclusion of the WHO’s mid-20th 
century Global Malaria Eradication Programme (GMEP), 
a strategy of malaria eradication was no longer prioritised 
and the accepted global approach was one of sustained 
control. After the launch of the Roll Back Malaria 
Partnership (RBM) in 1998, the Millennium Development 
Goals in 2000, and the formation of new donor 
mechanisms including the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, 
Tuberculosis and Malaria (Global Fund) in 2002 and the 
US President’s Malaria Initiative in 2005, global malaria 
morbidity and mortality began to decrease. This decrease 
was accelerated by the development and scale-up of 
innovative interventions and eff
 ective control strategies 
and the unprecedented political and fi
 nancial commitment 
from malaria-endemic countries. In 2007, in light of this 
extraordinary progress, Bill and Melinda Gates called for a 
renewed commitment to eradicate malaria.1 Endorsed by 
the WHO Director-General and supported by nations and 
organisations throughout the malaria community, the 
push for national and regional malaria elimination quickly 
built momentum and the countries and regions already 
implementing elimination plans were given due 
recognition.2–4 A three-part strategy for eradication under 
the Global Malaria Action Plan (appendix) was developed 
by RBM, a rapidly growing number of countries set forth 
national elimination goals, and regional networks were 
formed to facilitate collaboration and bolster political and 
fi
 nancial support for countries pursuing elimination.5–10
Elimination is now considered an attainable goal by 
most national malaria programmes, and the idea of 
eradication is once again on the global health agenda. 
More than 100 countries have eliminated malaria in the 
past century. Between 2007 and 2013, four countries were 
certifi
 ed as malaria-free by WHO (Armenia, Morocco, 
Turkmenistan, and United Arab Emirates), an additional 
eight countries moved into the WHO’s prevention of 
reintroduction phase after sustaining at least 3 years of 
zero local malaria transmission (Argentina, Egypt, Iraq, 
Georgia, Kyrgyzstan, Oman, Syrian Arab Republic, and 
Uzbekistan), and fi
 ve others interrupted local transmission 
(Azerbaijan, Costa Rica, Paraguay, Sri Lanka, and Turkey).11 
The malaria map continues to shrink with global economic 
development and increasing political and fi
 nancial support 
for elimination, and the toolkit of innovative technologies 
and interventions to defeat malaria continues to expand.12
This incredible progress, achieved in just 7 years, 
prompted Bill Gates to once again make a bold declaration 
in November, 2014: not only can malaria be eradicated, it 
can be achieved within a generation.13 As the global 
malaria community debates how and when to embark on 
this 
ambitious 
and 
aggressive 
eradication 
goal, 
articulating the great achievements made to date and 
elucidating the top priorities, challenges, and gaps will 
help inform these endeavours. In previous articles 
published in The Lancet in 20106,14–16 and 2013,17 we 
described the concepts and rationale behind malaria

elimination from operational, technical, and fi
 nancial 
standpoints, as well as the evolving epidemiological 
complexity of countries in low-transmission settings. As a 
continuation of that work, we present here the current 
status of the 35 malaria-eliminating countries, summarise 
existing national and regional elimination goals and the 
regional frameworks that support them, and identify the 
most substantial enabling factors and potential barriers to 
achieving eradication by a theoretical end date of 2040.
The 35 malaria-eliminating countries
A malaria-eliminating country describes a country that is 
in the process of moving from controlled low-endemic 
malaria to elimination, and fi
 ts into one of two categories: 
has assessed the feasibility of elimination, declared a 
national evidence-based goal, and has launched a malaria 
elimination strategy; or is strongly considering an 
evidence-based national elimination goal, has already 
made substantial progress in spatially progressive 
elimination, and is greatly reducing malaria nationwide.6 
In September, 2015, there were 35 countries that met the 
malaria-eliminating criteria (fi
 gure 1, appendix), with 
national or regional elimination goals ranging from 2013 
to 2035.14,18 Most of these countries are aiming to achieve 
elimination by 2020. From 2000 to 2013, these 
35 countries reduced their malaria burden by a 
remarkable 90%, from 1·6 million reported cases down 
to 160 000 cases, and reported deaths due to malaria have 
decreased by 87% (fi
 gure 2). The trends observed in the 
malaria-eliminating countries are particularly impressive 
when compared with the decreases in global malaria 
morbidity (30% decrease) and mortality (47% decrease) 
between 2000 and 2013.11
Three 
countries—Argentina, 
Kyrgyzstan, 
and 
Uzbekistan—were recently removed from the malaria-
eliminating country list after achieving three consecutive 
years of zero local malaria transmission, WHO’s criteria 
for the prevention of reintroduction phase.19 Argentina 
and Kyrgyzstan have initiated the process of malaria-free 
certifi
 cation with WHO, as has Paraguay, an eliminating 
country that reached the 3-year mark of zero locally 
transmitted cases in October, 2014 (appendix).11,20 Sri 
Lanka, which reported its last local case in 2012, reached 
the 3-year mark in October 2015.21 Three other countries 
have achieved zero local transmission but have not yet 
sustained it for 3 consecutive years: Azerbaijan, which 
reported zero cases for the fi
 rst time in 2013; and 
Costa Rica and Turkey, both of which reported local 
malaria cases in 2013 and 2014, but on investigation, all 
cases were determined to be relapsing infections of 
Plasmodium vivax acquired in previous years.11,22,23 These 
three countries met their elimination goals; notably, 
Costa Rica beat its national goal of 2020 by 7 years.
The other 30 malaria-eliminating countries have made 
great progress toward their elimination goals (appendix). 
In 2013, eight countries reported fewer than 50 locally 
transmitted cases (Algeria, Belize, Bhutan, Cape Verde, 
El Salvador, the French overseas territory of Mayotte, 
Saudi Arabia, Tajikistan); all but Mayotte have stated 
goals of elimination by 2020. Eight additional countries 
reported fewer than 800 cases (Botswana, China, 
Dominican Republic, Iran, Mexico, Panama, South 
Korea, Swaziland), and have set elimination goals 
ranging from 2017 to 2025.11,18 On the basis of present 
epidemiological status and recent trends, it seems that 
many of these 16 countries will achieve their stated

The list of eliminating countries is evaluated annually using data collected from WHO’s World Malaria Report; national malaria programme reports, elimination 
strategies, and operational plans; reports and updates from partner organisations and stakeholders; and other resources. When countries are certifi
 ed by the WHO as 
malaria-free, or when they report three consecutive years of zero locally transmitted cases in World Malaria Report, they are removed from the eliminating country 
list. From Shrinking the Malaria Map.

elimination goals early. The remaining 14 malaria-
eliminating countries continue to make steady progress.
Despite their impressive achievements, the 35 malaria-
eliminating countries face substantial challenges, and 
some have struggled to sustain their gains. Solomon 
Islands and Vanuatu are examples of lower middle-income 
island nations that have had diffi
  culty maintaining robust 
malaria-elimination programmes in recent years. As a 
result of weak programme capacity, both countries have 
experienced periodic spikes in malaria cases that have 
proven challenging to bring under control. Sustaining 
domestic and international funding as malaria burden 
decreases is a serious concern for most of the eliminating 
countries, 15 of which are now upper-middle income and 
are no longer eligible for the donor funding that supported 
their transition from control to elimination.24
Another major challenge for the 35 malaria-eliminating 
countries is the threat of malaria importation.25 For 
example, four countries in southern Africa—Botswana, 
Namibia, South Africa, and Swaziland—are seeking to 
eliminate local transmission within the next 5 years, but 
many of their neighbours have much higher malaria 
burdens. Mobile and migrant populations moving across 
borders often serve as primary sources of imported malaria 
cases, which are likely to drive secondary transmission.26,27 
These four malaria-eliminating countries all reported 
increases in malaria cases and deaths between 2012 and 
2013, possibly arising from imported malaria. Importation 
from high-endemic neighbours is a common challenge 
across most of the 35 malaria-eliminating countries; many 
of those that have reduced local transmission since 2000 
have also seen increases in imported cases.
Regional initiatives and progress toward 
elimination goals
Regional collaboration has been a key driver of progress 
for the 35 malaria-eliminating countries. Regional 
initiatives for malaria elimination have facilitated the 
coordination of interventions and the sharing of 
surveillance and coverage data, allowed for strengthened 
communication 
and 
knowledge-transfer 
between 
countries facing common problems, and helped generate 
much-needed political pressure on governments to 
increase support for malaria elimination. Since 2005, 
multicountry collaboration has been formalised under 
several regional initiatives, some of which have set 
ambitious regional elimination goals (appendix). In 
some regions, Mesoamerica for example, the regional 
goal is more aggressive than the milestones individual 
member nations had previously targeted, serving to push 
countries toward elimination faster than if they carried 
on alone. In regions that are inclusive of countries still in 
the control phase, such as Asia Pacifi
 c, the regional goal 
is more conservative than many of the national goals, 
which could serve to encourage countries with high 
transmission to catch up with their neighbours that are 
nearing elimination (fi
 gure 3).
Two early regional elimination initiatives were launched 
in the mid-2000s with regional elimination goals of 2015. 
The WHO-EURO initiative was formalised in 2005 under 
the Tashkent Declaration.7 Six of the nine signatory 
countries—Armenia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, 
Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan—have moved into the 
prevention of reintroduction phase, whereas the 
remaining three—Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, and Turkey—
are in the elimination phase. In 2014, only two local 
malaria cases were reported throughout the entire EURO 
region, both in Tajikistan.22 However, about 5000 imported 
cases were reported in the region—largely from Pakistan, 
India, and Afghanistan—indicating the need to maintain 
regional collaboration to prevent the re-establishment of 
local transmission through active surveillance and cross-
border coordination with other EURO countries, as well 
as neighbouring countries in the eastern Mediterranean 
region (EMRO) and the southeast Asian region 
(SEARO).28 No local cases had been reported in the EURO 
region as of September, 2015.29
The Malaria-Free Arabian Peninsula initiative focused on 
the two peninsular countries with continued transmission, 
Saudi Arabia and Yemen, and prioritised cross-border 
coordination of surveillance and vector control activities. 
Extensive fi
 nancial support for Yemen was provided by 
Gulf Cooperation Council member countries.8 While 
escalating political instability in Yemen has prevented the 
country from improving its malaria situation, Saudi Arabia 
reported only 34 local cases in 2013.11,30
In the Asia Pacifi
 c region, several regional bodies 
support malaria elimination. The fi
 rst, the Asia Pacifi
 c 
Malaria Elimination Network (APMEN), was launched 
in 2009 as a network of countries, institutions, and

stakeholders working together to eliminate malaria by 
facilitating 
collaboration 
and 
knowledge 
sharing, 
conducting training and research, increasing the capacity 
and leadership of malaria programmes, and building the 
evidence base for a regional elimination framework.31 In 
the past 6 years, eight countries have joined the original 
ten country partners of APMEN, the most recent of 
which was Papua New Guinea in September, 2015.32 
Participation in APMEN helps countries progress toward 
elimination 
by 
providing 
a 
forum 
to 
discuss 
programmatic and technical challenges and successes.9,33 
For example, after learning of China’s successful 
implementation of a rigorous surveillance and response 
system, other APMEN country partners have adopted the 
same approach.34
APMEN works in tandem with the Asia Pacifi
 c Leaders 
Malaria Alliance (APLMA), an affi
  liation of heads of 
government formed in 2013 to accelerate progress toward 
regional elimination in 22 countries. Under the guidance 
of APLMA’s co-chairs, regional leaders endorsed a goal of 
a malaria-free Asia Pacifi
 c by 2030 at the East Asia Summit 
in 2014.35,36 APLMA’s strategic roadmap for malaria 
elimination, fi
 nalised in November, 2015, emphasises 
aggressive, evidence-based responses to artemisinin and 
insecticide resistance, support for high-risk and hard-to-
reach groups, and the generation of new and innovative 
fi
 nancing streams to address the growing funding gap for 
eliminating countries.37

in the Greater Mekong Subregion, which includes 
Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam, and 
China’s Yunnan Province.38 In view of the serious threat 
of Plasmodium falciparum resistance to artemisinin and 
the potential for it to spread to India and Africa, merely 
containing resistance has been deemed insuffi
  cient; 
elimination of regional P falciparum transmission is 
recognised as the only acceptable response to this 
threat.38,39 The strategy outlines a phased approach to 
elimination, with P falciparum transmission eliminated 
in all six countries by 2025, and all forms of malaria 
eliminated by 2030. These eff
 orts are supported, partly, 
by the Regional Artemisinin Initiative grant from the 
Global Fund, which has allocated US$100 million over 
3 years to halt the spread of artemisinin resistance.38,40
In southern Africa, malaria elimination is supported by 
the E8 initiative, launched in 2009 to push the region 
toward zero malaria transmission. Coordinated by the E8 
Secretariat, the initiative facilitates collaboration and 
data-sharing across four malaria-eliminating countries at 
the frontline—Botswana, Namibia, South Africa, and 
Swaziland—and their second-line northern neighbours 
working to reduce transmission and achieve subnational 
elimination—Angola, 
Mozambique, 
Zambia, 
and 
Zimbabwe. The frontline countries are seeking to achieve 
elimination by 2020, a goal that is highly dependent on 
strong cross-border coordination with the second-line 
countries.27,41 The E8 was recently awarded a 3-year grant 
from the Global Fund to support regional surveillance 
activities, including the development of a shared 
surveillance system to track regional case trends in real 
time, the formation of malaria health posts in areas with 
poor access to health care, and the deployment of rapid 
response teams along national borders.27,41
The African Leaders Malaria Alliance (ALMA)—a high-
level coalition of 49 African Heads of Government—
recently adopted the malaria elimination agenda and 
developed the 2030 Africa Malaria Elimination Scorecard 
to monitor and encourage progress across member 
nations. The African Union further endorsed this goal by 
calling for malaria elimination in Africa by 2030.42
Ten member countries of the Council of Health 
Ministers from Central America and the Dominican 
Republic recently joined an initiative to eliminate malaria 
by 2020.43 The initiative is receiving fi
 nancial support 
through a grant from the Global Fund entitled Elimination 
of Malaria in Mesoamerica and Hispaniola (EMMIE), a 
performance-based, cash-on-delivery model designed to 
catalyse action toward elimination. The launch of EMMIE 
has driven some of the participating countries to reorient 
their malaria programmes to elimination, and led others 
to accelerate the elimination plans already in place to 
refl
 ect the regional 2020 goal.43,44 Additional assistance for 
malaria elimination on Hispaniola by 2020 comes from a 
new consortium called Malaria Zero, which is assisting 
Haiti and Dominican Republic in the development and 
implementation of a collaborative elimination strategy.45,46
Global strategies and progress toward 
elimination and eradication goals
The push to eliminate malaria has typically been a 
country’s decision, often inspired by national reductions 
in burden, increased political commitment, and a 
readiness to take on the ambitious task. As more 
countries and regions are setting goals to eliminate, 
global donors and multinational agencies have grown 
increasingly supportive of the elimination agenda. 
Unwavering support at all levels—national, regional, and 
global—is essential to achieve malaria eradication, and 
global endorsement of the eradication agenda will help 
generate the leadership and guidance necessary for 
countries to strengthen their national programmes.
RBM’s Action and Investment to defeat Malaria 
2016–2030 (AIM) and WHO’s Global Technical Strategy 
for Malaria 2016–2030 (GTS) both support the idea of 
elimination and eradication, stating that by 2020, malaria 
elimination will be achieved in at least ten countries that 
had transmission in 2015, and by 2030, elimination will 
be achieved in at least 35 countries, with an overall 
reduction in global malaria burden by 90% compared 
with 2015.47,48 Endorsed at the World Health Assembly in 
May, 2015, the GTS serves as the technical basis for 
national malaria strategic plans. AIM, the second 
generation of the Global Malaria Action Plan and 
launched in July, 2015, serves as a global advocacy 
instrument to ensure continued commitment and 
investment in malaria elimination and eradication, and 
positions malaria elimination as both benefi
 ting from 
and contributing to the Sustainable Development Goals.
While the GTS and AIM support progressive 
elimination, a new global advocacy document,18 From 
Aspiration to Action: What Will It Take to End Malaria? 
seeks to revitalise a robust debate on global malaria 
eradication. Addressed to country leaders, global policy 
makers, donor countries, and partner institutions, From 
Aspiration to Action uses a theoretical eradication date of 
2040 to anticipate requirements for resource mob-
ilisation, new intervention and technology develop 
ment, 
and strategy implementation to achieve a malaria-free 
world. The advocacy document also calls on the World 
Health Assembly to pass a resolution by 2020, 
committing to a goal of global malaria eradication.18
With the growing global enthusiasm for eradication, 
the targets set by GTS and AIM are probably more 
conservative than what is needed to achieve the theoretical 
2040 eradication goal described in From Aspiration to 
Action. The trajectories these documents set for the next 
15 years are quite cautious, putting the onus on the 
malaria community to make up tremendous ground in 
the fi
 nal 10 years (2030–40) leading to eradication. Based 
on recent trends in epidemiology, funding, and political 
support, and taking into account the existing national and 
regional elimination goals, we project that up to 
25 countries with transmission in 2015 can eliminate by 
2020, and over 60 countries can eliminate by 2030,

compared with the ten in 2020 and 35 in 2030 described 
in GTS and AIM (fi
 gure 4, fi
 gure 5).
Enabling factors for achieving malaria 
eradication
The announcement of a global eradication goal is likely 
to increase the visibility and importance of malaria 
elimination, potentially inspiring new donors and 
stakeholders to lend fi
 nancial, technical, and innovative 
operational support. Although countries will face 
substantial challenges as they pursue elimination, there 
are several factors that will further bolster global progress 
toward malaria eradication.
The identifi
 cation of the most eff
 ective mix of 
interventions and strategies that programmes can use for 
malaria elimination and the empowerment of programme 
managers to select the most appropriate combination of 
approaches for implementation in their unique settings 
are key for success. Elimination requires a more nuanced 
approach to intervention choice beyond traditional vector 
control and case management that must be tailored to 
suit the local eco-epidemiology. Within a country, diff
 erent 
provinces or districts might use a wide variety of methods 
depending on the local vector, parasite, importation rates, 
and, most importantly, the behavioural profi
 le of the 
target human population. Donors that fi
 nance malaria 
elimination and eradication eff
 orts must support low-
transmission programmes in the selection and funding 
of locally appropriate interventions, and in the provision 
of fl
 exible management, capacity building, and leadership 
training for a cadre of surveillance and response offi
  cers 
who can guide their programmes toward interruption of 
malaria transmission.49 Appropriate intervention selection 
and strategy development for elimination hinges on a 
rigorous, ongoing process of scientifi
 c research, 
knowledge sharing, and monitoring and evaluation. The 
Malaria Eradication Research Agenda (malERA) initiative 
and the Malaria Eradication Scientifi
 c Alliance have 
supported these eff
 orts since 2008.50,51
Low-transmission settings present an opportunity to 
achieve malaria elimination, yet as cases decrease in 
number, they tend to become clustered in geographic 
locations and in specifi
 c population groups, identifi
 cation 
of which presents new operational challenges.15 For an 
elimination programme, a strong surveillance system 
must enable the identifi
 cation and classifi
 cation of all 
foci of transmission and the targeting of appropriate 
resources and interventions in an aggressive and timely 
way. New surveillance methods such as spatial decision 
support systems (SDSS) that are linked to GPS-enabled 
smartphones and tablets or automated maps of 
transmission risk can support the identifi
 cation and 
classifi
 cation of hotspots, facilitate a rapid fl
 ow of data 
between levels of the health system, and generate real-
time evidence to support the national programme 
in choosing interventions and targeting limited 
resources.52,53 The WHO recently published a series of 
toolkits to improve access to high-risk migrant and 
mobile populations in the Greater Mekong Subregion, 
better detect population movement and new malaria 
transmission foci, and strengthen surveillance and 
epidemic response to drug-resistant malaria parasites.54

behaviours and movements are increasingly being 
adapted from the HIV fi
 eld, which will allow malaria 
programmes to appropriately tailor interventions to 
those population groups most at risk for infection.55
Malaria elimination is a regional and global public 
good: as more countries eliminate malaria within their 
borders, the risk that they will export malaria to their 
neighbours is reduced, better enabling the next wave of 
countries to embark on their own elimination plans. As 
regional initiatives grow in number and scope, 
surveillance platforms that capture early signs of drug 
and insecticide resistance as well as population 
movement and regional hotspots of transmission, such 
as that under development for the E8, will enable cross-
border data sharing and regional-level responses. 
Furthermore, these improvements to surveillance and 
regional collaboration also serve to strengthen the overall 
health systems of malaria-eliminating countries and will 
probably benefi
 t the control, elimination, and eradication 
eff
 orts of other diseases in the future.
Finally, advocacy has an essential role in bolstering 
political and fi
 nancial support for malaria elimination. Key 
advocacy elements that have been identifi
 ed as critical 
factors in infectious disease elimination are under 
development, including core advocacy messages, provision 
of advocacy tools, strong partnership-building, construction 
of a business case, and community engagement.56 With the 
increasing focus on domestic fi
 nancing mobilisation, 
these tools and approaches will need to be eff
 ectively 
deployed at the national level, particularly as countries near 
elimination, plan for prevention of reintroduction, and 
transition away from donor assistance.
Potential barriers to achieving malaria 
eradication
Despite the excellent progress and numerous enabling 
factors, serious challenges to achieving eradication 
remain that could serve as barriers to success if not 
adequately addressed. For the 35 malaria-eliminating 
countries, the most pressing dangers are a reduction of 
political commitment and an associated decrease in 
fi
 nancing to fi
 nish the job and prevent reintroduction of 
malaria over time. These two factors—waning political 
commitment and decreasing budgets, particularly in the 
face of competing health priorities—have historically 
been associated with massive malaria resurgences, 
several of which occurred in countries that are once again 
attempting to eliminate malaria.57,58 Although the many 
declarations 
from 
national, 
regional, 
and 
global 
stakeholders to eliminate and eradicate malaria are 
promising, if political and fi
 nancial commitment is not 
sustained, the goals will not be met. Further, failing to 
meet these goals could lead to disillusionment and 
undermine global progress and the prospects of 
eradication, mirroring the attitudes of the post-GMEP 
era.59 A World Health Assembly commitment to achieving 
eradication will have an essential role in maintaining 
focus and momentum toward this ambitious goal. 
Additionally, as the global community begins to shape the 
eradication agenda, a substantial degree of country-level 
engagement and ownership over the process is key for 
ensuring national political support and buy-in.
According 
to 
modelling 
work,24 
an 
estimated 
US$8·5 billion will be needed over the next 15 years to 
adequately support the malaria-eliminating countries in

their eff
 orts to achieve elimination and prevent re-
introduction of malaria. Largely responsible for funding 
interventions that enabled the global decreases in malaria 
incidence, external aid allocations have been waning in 
the past few years as a result of the global fi
 nancial crisis. 
Multilateral and bilateral donor funds have trended 
toward supporting low-income, high-malaria burden 
countries. Thus, a growing number of eliminating 
countries are graduating away from donor support. In a 
recent analysis of the previous country list (appendix), the 
malaria-eliminating countries are projected to receive a 
31% decrease in national funding allocations under the 
Global Fund’s new funding model—a serious shortfall at 
a time when maintaining their gains and advancing the 
eliminating agenda are essential.60 At the same time, 
while the national governments of the malaria-
eliminating countries provide nearly 80% of funding for 
elimination eff
 orts, domestic malaria budgets are often 
diverted toward more pressing disease priorities that are 
perceived as a greater threat to public health.61
Identifi
 cation of new and innovative funding streams 
and advocating governments to maintain political 
support for malaria elimination are crucial to ensure 
successful achievement of eradication. Recent examples 
of promising new funding sources for elimination and 
eradication include the Regional Malaria and Other 
Communicable Disease Threats Trust Fund administered 
by the Asian Development Bank for malaria-endemic 
countries in the Asia Pacifi
 c; the Ross Fund, a joint 
partnership between the Government of the UK and the 
Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to fund global malaria 
research and development; and the Lives and Livelihoods 
Fund, a partnership between the Islamic Development 
Bank and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation targeted 
toward Muslim countries to address a range of health 
and development issues, including malaria.62–64
Other substantial challenges to achieving eradication 
are technical in nature, such as increasing drug and 
insecticide resistance, limited treatment options for 
P vivax, and the increasing number of Plasmodium 
knowlesi infections in the Asia Pacifi
 c region. The research 
and development pipeline for new malaria insecticides, 
drugs, and diagnostics is robust and will receive additional 
fi
 nancial support through the Ross Fund, but new 
products will probably not be available for several years.18,63 
The identifi
 cation of an optimum mix of interventions, 
improvement of intervention targeting, and elimination 
of local reservoirs of drug resistant parasites could help 
slow the spread of insecticide and drug resistance in the 
meantime.38,39 Successfully combatting P vivax infections 
requires point-of-care diagnostics to detect glucose-6-
phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) defi
 ciency, a disorder 
that can lead to haemolytic anaemia in patients treated 
with primaquine, the only eff
 ective drug against the 
dormant liver stage of P vivax. G6PD detection kits are 
commercially available but not yet approved for use; drug 
alternatives to primaquine are under development.17,65 
The emergence of human P knowlesi infections in 
southeast Asia poses a unique threat to eradication, in 
that simian malaria parasites are very diffi
  cult to 
distinguish from human species and misdiagnosis is 
rampant. As a result, the extent of the P knowlesi burden 
and its transmission dynamics in human populations are 
largely 
unknown, 
and 
eff
 ective 
surveillance 
and 
prevention methods cannot be put in place. Additionally, 
a human malaria case caused by another simian parasite, 
Plasmodium cynomolgi, was recently detected in Malaysia 
and is morphologically identical to P vivax. Zoonotic 
malaria cases will probably continue to increase as urban 
development encroaches on the natural habitats of 
macaque monkeys, and new, more sensitive diagnostics 
will have a crucial role in preventing further spread.66,67
Discussion
As global dialogue once again centres on malaria 
eradication and support for this ambitious goal grows, 
understanding the remarkable progress that has been 
made on a national and regional scale over the past 
15 years is key. Although global focus on national malaria 
situations often focuses on Africa, huge strides toward 
elimination have been made in other parts of the world, 
facilitated by expanding regional platforms that have 
provided much needed political, fi
 nancial, and technical 
support to participating countries. The progress made by 
countries in Asia Pacifi
 c, the eastern Mediterranean, 
Europe, and Latin America must continue to be 
celebrated and their lessons and challenges propagated 
to inform and inspire continuing elimination eff
 orts in 
these regions and in Africa.
Global malaria eradication must be driven at the country 
level and achieved collaboratively, region by region. 
Looking to the future, existing and new regional initiatives 
have ample opportunity and room for growth. In the 
European region, a regional framework to prevent 
reintroduction and obtain malaria-free certifi
 cation has 
been developed by WHO and member nations.28 The 
Organization of Islamic Cooperation and the Islamic 
Development Bank, in cooperation with the Roll Back 
Malaria Partnership, recently called for increased political 
and fi
 nancial commitment and collective action to control 
and eliminate malaria in Islamic countries in the eastern 
Mediterranean and African regions, which account for 
more than half of the global malaria burden.68 In the Asia 
Pacifi
 c, APLMA has fi
 nalised its elimination roadmap and 
strategy to achieve the 2030 regional elimination goal, and 
a Malaria Elimination Dashboard is under development 
for the 22 countries in the region to measure and 
encourage progress.37 Formalised commitments to 
regional goals such as these could encourage similar 
eff
 orts on the national, regional, and global level.
When discussing global malaria goals and trends, it 
might be tempting to view the 35 malaria-eliminating 
countries as low priority compared with the high-burden, 
low-income countries where most malaria morbidity and

mortality occurs. This is a serious misconception. The 
progress in eliminating countries is a major driver of global 
progress, and success in these countries is a crucial step 
towards success in higher burden countries and, eventually, 
success in realising a malaria-free world. Maintaining the 
momentum of the eliminating countries is essential, 
requiring sustained focus, political and fi
 nancial support, 
rapid responses to challenges and setbacks, and constant 
recognition and celebration of progress.
