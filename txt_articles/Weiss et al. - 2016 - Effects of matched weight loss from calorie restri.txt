ABSTRACT
Background: Weight loss from calorie restriction (CR) and/or en-
durance exercise training (EX) is cardioprotective. However CR and
EX also have weight loss–independent benefits.
Objective: We tested the hypothesis that weight loss from calorie re-
striction and exercise combined (CREX) improves cardiovascular disease
(CVD) risk factors more so than similar weight loss from CR or EX alone.
Design: Overweight, sedentary men and women (n = 52; aged 45–65 y)
were randomly assigned to undergo 6–8% weight loss by using CR, EX,
or CREX. Outcomes were measured before and after weight loss and
included maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max), resting blood pres-
sure, fasting plasma lipids, glucose, C-reactive protein, and arterial
stiffness [carotid–femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV) and carotid
augmentation index (AI)]. Values are means 6 SEs.
Results: Reductions in body weight (w7%) were similar in all groups.
VO2max changed in proportion to the amount of exercise performed
(CR, 21% 6 3%; EX, +22% 6 3%; and CREX, +11% 6 3%). None
of the changes in CVD risk factors differed between groups. For all
groups combined, decreases were observed for systolic and diastolic
blood pressure (25 6 1 and 24 6 1 mm Hg, respectively; both
P , 0.0008), total cholesterol (217 6 4 mg/dL; P , 0.0001), non-
HDL cholesterol (216 6 3 mg/dL; P , 0.0001), triglycerides (218 6
8 mg/dL; P = 0.03), and glucose (23 6 1 mg/dL; P = 0.0003). No
changes were observed for HDL cholesterol (P = 0.30), C-reactive pro-
tein (P = 0.10), PWV (P = 0.30), or AI (P = 0.84). These changes would
be expected to decrease the lifetime risk of CVD from 46% to 36%.
Conclusion: Matched weight losses from CR, EX, and CREX have
substantial beneficial effects on CVD risk factors. However, the
effects are not additive when weight loss is matched. This trial
was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00777621.

INTRODUCTION
Cardiovascular disease (CVD)6 is the leading cause of death
in the United States, accounting for 35% of adult deaths (1).
Observational studies indicate that excess body weight and ad-
iposity are associated with an increased CVD risk (2). Further-
more, intervention studies show that weight loss has beneficial
effects on CVD risk factors (3, 4), and would therefore be ex-
pected to prevent CVD. Dietary calorie restriction (CR) and
endurance exercise training (EX) both can cause energy deficits
and weight loss (5, 6), and consequently improve CVD risk
factors (7). However, dietary changes and exercise also have
effects on CVD risk factors through mechanisms that do not
depend on weight loss. For example, in the absence of weight
loss, the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diet reduces
blood pressure (BP) (8), and a diet that is rich in plant sterols,
soy protein, fiber, and nuts reduces serum LDL cholesterol
concentrations (9). Furthermore, EX is associated with lower BP
(10, 11), a better serum lipid profile (12), and lower CVD
mortality (13) in a manner that does not appear to depend on
body weight or weight loss.
We previously demonstrated that weight loss induced by CR
alone and EX alone have similar beneficial effects on CVD risk
factors (7). However, calorie restriction and exercise combined
(CREX) was not studied. In light of the weight loss–independent
effects of diet and exercise on CVD risk factors, it is conceivable
that they may have additive effects. Therefore, the purpose of
the present study (NCT00777621) was to test the hypothesis that
modest weight loss in overweight men and women has greater
beneficial effects on CVD risk factors when it is induced by

 CREX than it does when similar weight loss is caused by CR or
EX alone. The data reported in this manuscript were ancillary
outcomes that were collected as part of a study on the effects of
CR and exercise on glucose and insulin metabolism; the primary
outcomes have been published previously (14) and therefore are
not included in the present report. Some of the results related to
intervention adherence were presented in the earlier paper and
are provided again in the present report to assist with interpreta-
tion of the results.
METHODS
Participants
Sedentary, middle-aged men and postmenopausal women aged
45–65 y who were overweight [BMI (in kg/m2) 25.0–29.9] were
recruited from the Saint Louis, Missouri, metropolitan area.
Screening tests, including a medical evaluation and diagnostic
electrocardiogram exercise stress test were used to identify and
exclude volunteers with major chronic diseases, conditions that
would interfere with exercise or in which exercise is contra-
indicated, or conditions that would interfere with interpretation
of results. Examples include a history or evidence of coronary
artery disease, musculoskeletal problems, diabetes (previously
diagnosed or fasting blood glucose $126 mg/dL), BP of $160
mm Hg systolic or $100 mm Hg diastolic, and smoking. Use of
medications to control blood glucose concentrations was ex-
clusionary. For all other medications, participants were required
to have been on stable dosages for $6 mo before baseline
testing and were advised to maintain dosages during the study
(none of the participants had changes in medications that affect
serum lipids, BP, or heart rate (HR) during the study; 2 participants
had changes in anti-inflammatory medications). Volunteers also
were excluded if they had significant (.3%) weight change within
the previous 6 mo and if they performed regular vigorous endur-
ance exercise (moderate- to hard-effort exercise, $20 min/session,
and $3 times/wk) during the 6 mo before enrollment.
Informed written consent to participate in the study was
obtained from all volunteers who underwent screening. The study
was approved by the institutional review boards at Saint Louis
University and Washington University and was conducted from
2008 to 2015.
Study design and random assignment
Subjects were randomly assigned to the CR, EX, or CREX
group. The randomization scheme included sex stratification and
initially used a study group allocation ratio of 1:1:1. However, the
ratio later was revised to 2:2:1 (greater enrollment in the CR and
EX groups) to compensate for more subject withdrawals from
these groups. Outcome assessments were performed at baseline
and after weight loss.
Interventions
All 3 interventions were designed to create a 20% energy deficit
and decrease body mass by 6–8% over 12–14 wk (i.e., a decrease
of w0.5% of baseline body weight/wk). The intervention duration
was extended as needed for individual participants to reach the
weight loss goal. Prescriptions for dietary energy restriction and
energy expenditure were based on estimates of baseline total en-
ergy expenditure (TEE) and energy intake, as follows: 1) Dietary
Reference Intakes equations for estimated energy requirements
(15), 2) 3-d food diaries with nutrient analysis (described below),
3) accelerometry (described below), and 4) 7-d physical activity
recall interviews [(PARs) described below]. Because the partici-
pants were weight stable at baseline, which implied that TEE and
energy intake were equal, the mean of all 4 measures was used to
reflect TEE and energy intake. The prescriptions were adjusted as
needed during the intervention to achieve the targeted rate of
weight loss. Once the weight loss goal was attained, and to avoid
the potentially confounding effects of a negative energy balance
on the outcomes, body weight was stabilized for 2 wk (i.e.,
maintained within a 0.5-kg range based on 3-d rolling mean
weight) by adjusting the CR and/or EX prescriptions. Throughout
the study, the participants recorded daily fasting morning body
weight at home and visited our clinic weekly to be weighed, turn
in home weight logs, and undergo other intervention-specific re-
quirements (described below).
CR intervention
The objective of the CR intervention was to reduce energy
intake by w20% and maintain physical activity at baseline
levels. The participants completed 3-d food diaries during the
first 3 wk of the intervention and periodically thereafter; the
study dietitians used the diaries as the basis for making per-
sonalized dietary recommendations. To reduce their energy in-
take, participants were advised to reduce food portion sizes and
to replace energy-dense foods (e.g., cheeseburgers and soda)
with foods of lower energy density (e.g., vegetables, fruits, and
whole grains). Dietary advice also included recommendations
for macronutrient intake to be within the recommended ranges
(percentages of total energy: carbohydrate, 45–65; fat, 20–35;
and protein, 10–35) (15). For participants who were not able to
make adequate dietary changes on the basis of counseling alone,
weeklong periods of full food provision (20% hypocaloric diet)
were used as an additional intervention strategy.
EX intervention
The goal in the EX intervention was to increase TEE by w20%
without dietary changes. Weekly exercise energy expenditure
prescriptions were sufficient to increase total daily energy ex-
penditure by 20%. The prescriptions were calculated after ac-
counting for differences between gross and net exercise energy
expenditure, as described previously (16). Participants moni-
tored their progress toward the exercise energy expenditure
goals with HR monitors (Polar) that provided estimates of ex-
ercise energy expenditure based on exercise HR, body weight,
maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max), and maximal and
resting HR. The monitors stored exercise data (e.g., exercise
energy expenditure, and HR, among others), which were re-
trieved by study personnel during weekly meetings with the
participants. Specific prescriptions for exercise frequency and
intensity were not provided. However, to increase the likeli-
hood that they would meet the weekly energy expenditure
goals, the participants were encouraged to perform exercise
every day and to strive for moderate- and high-intensity exercise.
The types of exercise that were recommended were cardiovascular

 exercise (e.g., brisk walking and cycling) and functional physical
activities (e.g., walking to work or performing yard work). Strength
and resistance exercise was not used, because it only has a small
effect on energy expenditure and may affect CVD risk through
unique mechanisms. The participants exercised under the super-
vision of study personnel during the initial 3–6 exercise sessions
and as needed thereafter to promote intervention compliance.
Otherwise, the subjects were encouraged to exercise on their own
(i.e., at a fitness facility, home, or outdoors), but were given free
access to the on-campus exercise facilities.
CREX intervention
The CREX intervention was designed to create a 20% energy
deficit by using a combination of CR and EX, with each con-
tributing equally to the total deficit. The intervention methods
were the same as those described for CR and EX.
Anthropometric measurements and body composition
Fasting morning body weight was measured on 2 separate days
at each study time point. On each occasion, weight was measured
in duplicatewhile the participant was wearing only a hospital gown
and underwear. Standing height without shoes was measured with
the use of a wall-mounted stadiometer. Circumferences were
measured in duplicate and averaged; if the duplicates differed by
$5 mm, additional measures were made until 2 values differed by
,5 mm. Waist circumference was measured at the narrowest
portion of the waist, inferior to the xiphoid and superior to the
iliac crests. Hip circumference was measured at the maximal
posterior protuberance of the buttocks. Dual-energy X-ray ab-
sorptiometry (Lunar iDXA, software version 13.31; GE Health
care) was used to measure body composition. Body weight and
composition data have been reported previously (14).
Dietary intake
Dietary intake was measured by using 3-d food diaries, each of
which included 2 weekdays and 1 weekend day. The diaries were
analyzed with Food Processor SQL software (ESHA Research).
The assessments that were performed at the end of the inter-
vention were performed just before the weight stability period to
reflect the diet pattern that was used during active weight loss.
Energy expenditure
TEE was estimated as the mean of TEE results from PARs and
accelerometry. The PAR was a modified version of the Stanford
7-d PAR (17). Accelerometry was performed with triaxial ac-
celerometers (RT3; StayHealthy). Follow-up assessments were
performed just before the weight stabilization period; therefore,
the results reflect energy expenditure during active weight loss.
Aerobic capacity
VO2max was determined by using indirect calorimetry
(MedGraphics CardiO2; Medical Graphics Corporation) during
a maximal graded exercise test to exhaustion with the use of
a modified Balke protocol.
BP and resting HR
BP was measured by using a mercury sphygmomanometer and
auscultation and was performed in accordance with American
Heart Association guidelines (18), which also meet or exceed the
recommendations of the seventh report of the Joint National
Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment
of High Blood Pressure (19). At each time point in the study,
morning fasting BP was measured on 2 separate days. The
measures were made after $5 min of quiet rest with the arms
supported and feet flat on the floor. Two measures were taken on
each arm; if the results differed by $5 mm Hg, additional
measures were made until the duplicates for each arm were
within 5 mm Hg. The mean BP for both arms on both days were
used as the study outcome.
Immediately after the BP measurement, HR was measured by
palpating and counting the radial artery pulse for 60 s. The mean
of measures made on 2 separate days was used as the study
outcome.
Blood collection and analyses
After an overnight fast, blood was acquired from an arm vein;
plasma and serum were isolated with the use of standard clinical
methods. Plasma lipid concentrations were analyzed by a Clinical
Laboratory Improvement Amendments-certified clinical labo-
ratory at the medical center. C-reactive protein was measured in
serum by using an ELISA (high sensitivity C-reactive protein,
Quantikine; R&D Systems).
Fasting venous blood samples for quantification of glucose and
insulin were acquired on 2 separate days and results were av-
eraged. Plasma glucose was measured with the use of an auto-
mated analyzer based on the glucose oxidase reaction (2300 Stat
Plus; YSI). Plasma insulin was measured with the use of a chemi-
luminescent immunoassay (Immulite; Siemens USA). HOMA-IR
was calculated from fasting glucose and insulin (20) and log-
transformed for data analyses.
Arterial stiffness
Pulse wave velocity (PWV) and augmentation index (AI)
were used as indexes of arterial stiffness. PWV was measured by
assessing transcutaneous Doppler flow measurements (Model 806-
CB; Parks Medical Electronics) at the right common carotid artery
and the right femoral artery (21). Twenty Doppler wave forms were
recorded (Windaq software, version 2.31; DATAQ Instruments) at
the 2 sites simultaneously. Pulse transit time was determined as the
difference in pulse arrival times for the carotid and femoral sites
and was based on foot-to-foot comparisons of wave forms from the
2 sites, with the foot being identified as the peak on the second
derivative of the pulse wave. The distances between the aorta and
the carotid site and the aorta and the femoral site were measured
over the skin with the use of the second intercostal space as
a landmark for the aorta; the difference between these distances
was considered to be the propagation distance (22). PWV for each
pulse was calculated as propagation distance in meters divided by
transit time in seconds. The mean of the 20 waveforms was used to
reflect the PWV for one test.
AI was determined by using applanation tonometry (model no.
TCB-500; Millar Instruments) on the common carotid artery (21).
At least 20 digital pulse waves were recorded and analyzed with

 Windaq software (version 2.31; DATAQ Instruments). The
software was used to identify the maximum and minimum
voltage on each wave form, with the difference corresponding to
pulse pressure. The software also was used to generate the second
derivative of the pulse wave, which was used for the identification
of the shoulder on the upstroke of the raw wave form. The
difference between the peak voltage and the voltage at the
shoulder was calculated to reflect augmentation pressure. AI was
calculated as AI = 100 3 AP/PP, where AP is augmentation
pressure and PP is pulse pressure, for each of the 20+ wave-
forms, and the resulting values were averaged.
Statistical analyses
The analyses were performed on a per-protocol basis and
therefore only included data from subjects who provided follow-
up data and were adherent to the intervention (i.e., excluding
participants who had little or no weight loss, defined as ,1%
reduction from baseline). Intention-to-treat analyses were not
used because they resulted in differences in weight loss between
groups (because of differences in dropout rates and intervention
adherence), which is problematic when studying the effects of
matched weight loss on outcomes. Baseline characteristics be-
tween groups were compared with Fisher’s exact tests and
ANOVAs. Outcomes were compared by using an ANCOVA, in
which the study group was the independent variable, change
in the outcome (i.e., final value minus baseline value) was the
dependent variable, and the baseline value was a covariate.
Between-group post hoc comparisons were performed with the
use of the protected F test principle and least significant dif-
ference tests. Baseline-adjusted least squares means were used
to evaluate the significance of within-group changes. All sta-
tistical tests were 2-tailed, and significance was accepted at P #
0.05. Data are presented as arithmetic means 6 SEs, unless
indicated otherwise and except for mean change values, which
were adjusted for baseline values. Analyses were performed
with the use of SAS for Windows (version 9.3).
Sample sizes of 18 subjects/group were calculated based on the
primary outcomes of the parent study (glucose tolerance and in-
sulin action), which were reported previously (14). For selected
ancillary outcomes in the present study, we used these sample sizes
to calculate the statistical power (1-b) to detect meaningful dif-
ferences in the magnitude of change between groups. Meaningful
differences were defined as 10% of the baseline values from our
previous study (7). For example, baseline systolic BP was 120
mm Hg; therefore, a change of 12 mm Hg was considered to be
meaningful. The inputs for the analyses also included an a of
0.05, 1-tailed tests, and SDs of change scores from our previous
study (7). The resulting power values for systolic and diastolic
BP; total, LDL, and HDL cholesterol; and triglycerides ranged
from 0.79 to 0.99, indicating high power. Serum C-reactive pro-
tein concentrations and HOMA-IR were underpowered, with
calculated power values of 0.14 and 0.21, respectively.
RESULTS
Participants
A total of 525 individuals inquired about the study. Most (n =
393) were not eligible (mostly on the basis of BMI $ 30), and
63 were not interested after learning more details about the
study requirements. The remaining 69 men and women were
enrolled, underwent baseline testing, and were randomly allo-
cated to one of the 3 study groups (Figure 1). One participant
withdrew immediately after random assignment because of dis-
satisfaction with her group assignment, and 11 participants
withdrew during the intervention for personal reasons (n = 9) or
medical reasons unrelated to the study (n = 2). Data from 5
participants were excluded because these individuals were
noncompliant with the interventions (0.5% weight loss to 1.3%
weight gain). Therefore, the final data analyses were based on 52
participants; sample sizes for each group are shown in Figure 1
and Table 1. None of the demographic or baseline characteris-
tics differed between groups (Table 1).
Weight loss and body composition
By design, weight loss was w7% in all 3 study groups and did
not differ (P = 0.43) between groups (CR, 6.8% 6 0.5%; EX,
7.1% 6 0.5%; CREX, 27.6% 6 0.4%; Table 2). The weight
change corresponded with an w15% reduction in fat mass and
significant reductions in trunk fat, waist circumference, and
waist-to-hip ratio that did not differ between groups (Table 2).
Fat-free mass decreased by 2.5% and 1.6% in the CR and CREX
groups, respectively (both P # 0.002), whereas no change was
observed in the EX group (P = 0.56); however, the between-
group comparison of changes did not achieve statistical signif-
icance (P = 0.06). Body weight did not change significantly in
any of the groups during the 2-wk weight stability period that
preceded follow-up testing (all P $ 0.28).
Dietary intake
Changes in self-reported energy intake differed significantly
between groups (P = 0.0002), with the CR (232% 6 4%; P ,
0.0001) and CREX (227% 6 4%; P , 0.0001) groups de-
creasing significantly and the EX group not changing (27% 6
4%, P = 0.11). The results were similar when reported as ab-
solute changes in energy intake (Table 3), although the change
in the EX group also became significant (P = 0.004). For all
groups combined, there was a small decrease in the contribution
of fat to total energy intake (P = 0.02) and a small increase in
protein (P = 0.003); however, the changes did not differ between
groups (Table 3, both between-group P values $ 0.54).
Exercise volume, energy expenditure, and aerobic capacity
On the basis of data from the HR monitors used by the par-
ticipants during exercise, and as reported previously (14), the EX
group had a net exercise energy expenditure of 412 6 26 kcal/d
(22% of baseline TEE), and exercised 8 6 1 times/wk for a total
weekly exercise duration of 7.4 6 0.5 h/wk; mean intensity was
77% 6 1% of measured maximum HR. For the CREX group,
exercise energy expenditure was 217 6 23 kcal/d (10% of
baseline TEE), exercise frequency was 6 6 1 sessions/wk, total
weekly exercise time was 4.4 6 0.5 h/wk, and the mean intensity
was 74% 6 1% of maximal HR. On the basis of estimates from
the PAR and accelerometers, total daily energy expenditure in-
creased in the EX (185 6 53 kcal/d, P = 0.001) and CREX
(126 6 48 kcal/d, P = 0.01) groups and did not change
from baseline in the CR group (222 6 51 kcal/d, P = 0.66)

 (between-group P = 0.02). The increases in TEE were less than
those for exercise energy expenditure, as expected because of
weight loss during the intervention. Sedentary and light physical
activity did not change on the basis of the PAR (data not shown;
P $ 0.19 for all groups).
VO2max relative to body mass did not change in the CR group
(21% 6 3%; P = 0.85), whereas moderate and large increases
were observed in the CREX group (11% 6 3%; P = 0.0006) and
EX group (22% 6 3%; P , 0.0001), respectively (between-
group P , 0.0001; Table 2). When VO2max was expressed in
absolute terms or relative to fat-free mass, the significant dif-
ference between groups remained. However, within group,
VO2max decreased in the CR group, increased in the EX group,
and was unchanged in the CREX group (Table 2).
BP and HR
Mean BP at baseline was below the criteria for pre-
hypertension. Systolic and diastolic BPs decreased when data
from all groups were pooled (Table 4). There was a tendency for

 differences between groups (P = 0.07) for systolic BP, with
reductions in the CR (P = 0.0002) and CREX (P = 0.01)
groups, whereas the EX group did not change (P = 0.63).
Diastolic BP decreased in all groups, and there was no dif-
ference in the magnitude of improvement between groups.
Resting HR decreased slightly when data from all groups were
pooled (Table 4). However, there were no differences between
groups.
Plasma lipids
Total, LDL, and non-HDL cholesterol concentrations de-
creased significantly (all P , 0.01) and to a similar extent in the
3 study groups (all between-group P values $ 0.26) (Table 4).
HDL cholesterol concentrations did not change (P = 0.30), nor
were there between-group differences in HDL cholesterol re-
sponses to the interventions (P = 0.19). The ratio of total to HDL
cholesterol decreased with all groups combined, and there were
no differences between groups for the magnitude of change.
Triglyceride concentrations decreased by 16% for all groups
combined and there were no significant differences between
groups (P = 0.12).
Glucose, insulin, and C-reactive protein
Fasting plasma glucose concentrations decreased by 3% from
baseline (P = 0.0003), and fasting insulin decreased by 25%
(P , 0.0001). This resulted in a 70% reduction in the HOMA-IR
index (Table 4). There were no differences between groups for
glucose, insulin, or HOMA-IR index (all P $ 0.28). C-reactive
protein did not change.
Arterial stiffness
PWV and AI did not change with weight loss, nor were there
differences in PWV or AI between groups (Table 5). Because
these measures are susceptible to confounding by BP and HR,
we also performed analyses in which the changes in BP and HR
were included as covariates. However, this did not change the
findings (data not shown). Furthermore, we adjusted the AI
values to a standardized HR of 75 beats/min on the basis of the
inverse relation between AI and HR of 4.8 AI units per HR of 10
beats/min (23, 24), and, again, the findings were not altered
(Table 5).
DISCUSSION
Reductions in energy intake and increases in energy expen-
diture result in weight loss, which has well-known health benefits.
However, dietary changes and exercise training also have benefits
that are not directly attributable to weight loss (8–13). In this
context, we hypothesized that CREX would yield greater im-
provements in risk factors for CVD than would similar weight
loss from CR or EX alone. However, the results did not support
this hypothesis. Substantial improvements were observed for
most of the risk factors; on the basis of published algorithms
(25) these changes would be expected to lower the lifetime risk
of developing CVD from 46% to 36%. However, contrary to our
expectations, the magnitude of improvement did not depend on
whether CR, EX, or CREX was used to promote weight loss.
This finding is in contrast to the additive effects of CR and EX
on insulin action that we recently reported elsewhere (14).
Two other studies evaluated the independent and combined
effects of CR and EX (26, 27). However, in these studies, the
exercise interventions did not provide meaningful weight loss,

WEIGHT LOSS AND CVD RISK FACTORS
583

 and the magnitude of weight loss differed between groups,
making it difficult to determine whether the observed changes in
risk factors were attributable to weight loss or to weight loss–
independent effects. Furthermore, in a previous study, we showed
that matched, yearlong weight losses from CR and EX had
similar beneficial effects on CVD risk factors (7); however,
additive effects could not be evaluated because there was not
a group that underwent CREX. To our knowledge, the present
study is the first to compare the independent and combined ef-
fects of CR and EX with matched weight loss.
A straightforward interpretation of the findings from the
present study is that weight loss itself provides the major car-
dioprotective effect of CREX and that the benefits do not depend
on which approach to weight loss is used. However, 3 issues
related to this notion warrant consideration. First, although the
physiologic mechanisms are not clear, the cardioprotective ef-
fects of exercise are not necessarily mediated by changes in CVD
risk factors. Accordingly, a sedentary lifestyle and low aerobic
capacity increase CVD risk by 50–100%, even after accounting
for other risk factors (28, 29). Therefore, despite the fact that the
EX and CREX groups did not have greater improvements in BP,
lipids, glucose, and body composition, these groups would be at
lower risk of CVD because they were no longer sedentary and
because of the increases in VO2max. Second, because adiposity is
an independent risk factor for CVD (30), the small nonsignificant
tendency for greater fat mass reductions (and preservation of fat-
free mass), may confer an advantage for exercise-induced weight
loss. Third, because the study was designed for matched weight
losses in the 3 study groups, the degree of CR and the amount of
EX was less in the CREX group than it was in the CR and EX
groups, respectively. Accordingly, the weight loss–independent
benefits of CR and EX may have been lower. If the CR and EX
doses were matched, it is plausible that the changes in CVD risk
factors would have been greater in the CREX group; however, it
would not be possible to distinguish the CR- and EX-specific
effects from the greater weight loss that also would occur in this
scenario.
The magnitude of weight loss in the present study (w7%)
was modest and was not sufficient for the mean BMI to reach
optimal values. Despite this, the benefits were relatively large.

1Values are arithmetic means 6 SEs, except for change values, which are least squares means 6 SEs that have been
adjusted for differences in baseline values between groups. Between-group P values reflect the significance of the between-
group differences in change values after adjustment for baseline values with the use of ANCOVA. Values for augmentation
index corrected for heart rate were adjusted to a standardized heart rate of 75 beats/min based on published recommen-
dations (23, 24). CR, calorie restriction; CREX, calorie restriction and exercise combined; EX, endurance exercise training.

 However, larger and longer-term weight loss would likely
produce even greater benefits. For example, middle-aged in-
dividuals undergoing self-imposed CR for a mean of 6 y (BMI
19.6 6 0.4) had LDL cholesterol concentrations of 86 6
5 mg/dL, HDL cholesterol concentrations of 65 6 7 mg/dL,
triglyceride concentrations of 54 6 4 mg/dL, and systolic and
diastolic BPs of 97 6 2 and 59 6 1 mm Hg (31), respectively,
which corresponds with a predicted lifetime CVD risk of 5%
(25). All of these are substantially better than the corre-
sponding postintervention values from the present study (LDL
cholesterol: 109 6 3 mg/dL; HDL cholesterol: 55 6 2 mg/dL;
triglycerides: 93 6 7 mg/dL; BP: 112 6 2/72 6 1 mm Hg; and
lifetime CVD risk: 36%). Exercise interventions of longer
duration also may have greater effects than those observed in
the present study. For example, HDL cholesterol does not
appear to change significantly until $9 mo of EX has been
completed (32). Furthermore, whereas 1 y of training increased
HDL cholesterol concentrations from 38 6 3 mg/dL to 45 6
4 mg/dL in patients with CVD, 7 y of training increased their
HDL cholesterol concentrations further, to 53 6 5 mg/dL (33).
Arterial stiffness increases throughout the adult life span (34,
35), largely because of changes in elastin and collagen in the
extracellular matrix of the arterial wall (36). Although increasing
age and high BP are strongly associated with arterial stiffness (37,
38), they are also associated with an increased risk of CVD
mortality, even after accounting for these and other CVD risk
factors (39). We included carotid–femoral PWV and AI as
measures of arterial stiffness in the present study and neither
changed significantly. In a recent review and meta-analysis, it
was found that 8 other weight loss studies also reported no effect
of weight loss on carotid–femoral PWV, whereas 12 studies did
observe beneficial effects. With all 20 studies pooled, the results
indicated that a mean weight loss of 8% results in a statistically
and clinically significant PWV reduction (improvement) of
0.6 m/s (40). This suggests that large sample sizes may be
needed to reliably detect significant changes in PWV. In-
terestingly, we also observed a 0.6 m/s reduction in PWV (all
groups combined), albeit not significant, perhaps because of the
small sample size.
Our study has limitations. First, CVD risk factors were mea-
sured as surrogates for hard outcomes, such as myocardial
infarction or CVD mortality. However, studies that have evalu-
ated hard outcomes have had trouble producing long-term weight
loss (41); therefore, they cannot provide definitive information
about the effects of successful weight loss on hard CVD out-
comes. Second, the eligibility criteria were selected to ensure
a homogeneous population that would tolerate the intervention,
and to avoid the confounding effects of medical or other con-
ditions. However, this limits the generalizability of the findings.
Lastly, the differences in CVD risk outcomes between groups
may have been nonsignificant because of an inadequate sample
size. However, with the exception of triglycerides, there were no
statistical trends for the additive effects of CR and EX. Fur-
thermore, for most outcomes, the improvements in the CREX
group were only modestly greater than in the other groups and
would be of questionable clinical significance if they were sta-
tistically significant. For example, the decrease in LDL choles-
terol in the CREX group was only 2–4 mg/dL better than that in
the other groups, and the reduction in diastolic BP was only 2
mm Hg greater than that in the other groups.
In conclusion, the results from this study indicate that matched
7% weight losses from CR, EX, or CREX have similar but
substantial beneficial effects on BP, plasma lipids, and fasting
blood glucose. These findings suggest that the weight loss–
independent effects of CR and EX on risk factors for CVD are
not additive. However, because a sedentary lifestyle and poor
aerobic capacity are independent risk factors for CVD, EX
provides a benefit that cannot be achieved by using CR alone;
therefore, EX remains as a critical component of CVD risk re-
duction programs. The evidence from this study adds to that
from a multitude of studies, which clearly indicate that weight
loss has powerful effects to improve the CVD risk profile. Ac-
cordingly, continued research and programs are needed to promote
long-term adherence to weight loss for the general population.
