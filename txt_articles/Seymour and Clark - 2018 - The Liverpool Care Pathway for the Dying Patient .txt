Abstract
 The Liverpool Care Pathway for the Dying Patient (‘the LCP’)
Background:
was an integrated care pathway (ICP) recommended by successive
governments in England and Wales to improve end-of-life care, using
insights from hospice and palliative care. It was discontinued in 2014
following mounting criticism and a national review.  The ensuing debate
among clinicians polarised between ‘blaming’ of the LCP and regret at its
removal.
Employing the concept of ‘boundary objects’, we aimed to address three
questions: 1) why and how did the LCP come to prominence as a vehicle of
policy and practice 2) what factors contributed to its demise? 3) what
immediate implications and lessons resulted from its withdrawal?
 We use primary and secondary sources in the public domain to

well as conflicting perceptions about end-of-life interventions. While the
LCP had some weaknesses in its formulation and implementation, it
became the bearer of responsibility for all aspects of NHS end-of-life care.
This was beyond its original remit. It exposed fault lines in the NHS,
provided a platform for debates about the ‘evidence’ required to underpin
innovations in palliative care and became a conduit of discord about ‘good’
or ‘bad’ practice in care of the dying. It also fostered a previously unseen
critique of assumptions within palliative care.

the dangers of scaling up clinical interventions without an evidence base,

consideration of the unintended consequences that might result from the
roll out of new end-of-life interventions.

 Introduction
The importance of palliative care interventions to relieve suffering 
in the context of advanced disease and in the face of death, has 
 
gained policy, clinical and academic endorsement worldwide1,2. 
Beginning in the 1960s with the emergence of new hospice 
 
programmes, the modern field of palliative and end of life care 
grew rapidly in the later decades of the twentieth century and has 
 
continued to make progress, attracting wide interest and support, 
 
and extending its reach3. The World Health Organization first 
 
defined palliative care in 19904 and in 2014 the World Health 
 
Assembly issued a resolution calling on all governments to adopt 
policies to support the delivery of palliative care across the life 
course and in all relevant institutional and community settings5. 
Nevertheless, palliative care faces many challenges. It is still 
weakly developed in many low and middle income countries, and 
at the same time advanced and well-resourced health care systems 
are struggling to deliver its benefits, that have been demonstrated 
in specialist settings, across the wider spectrum of health and 
 
social care services.
The epidemiology of dying is also changing. Increasingly for 
many, death will follow an extended period of uncertainty, 
 
frailty and multiple morbidity in advanced old age. In contrast, 
the rapidly progressing downward trajectory of dying with its 
clear point of entry to the dying phase, which was central to the 
original hospice model of cancer palliative care, will become less 
 
common6. Already a series of complex challenges is emerging 
around prognostication, communication and the planning of care 
for the gravely ill or dying person, especially in hospitals7. The 
 
scenario has given rise to numerous attempts to take specialist 
 
palliative care knowledge and apply it ‘at scale’ within the 
 
mainstream of the health and social care system – in hospitals, 
 
care homes, and in the community. 
In this paper, drawing on the concept of ‘boundary objects’8 we 
examine one specific and concerted effort to respond to these 
 
challenges. We chart the rise and demise of an integrated care 
 
pathway for dying patients, which grew out of the hospice 
 
context and over more than a decade was promoted across the 
health care system in the United Kingdom, before it was withdrawn 
from use. The integrated care pathway that became known as ‘The 
 
Liverpool Care Pathway for the Dying Patient’, (henceforth 
 
referred to here as the ‘LCP’), was first described in a publica-
tion in 19979 as a means of transferring key principles derived 
 
from hospice care into general health care settings, such as hospi-
tals and care homes. It was endorsed by successive governments 
and in particular adopted as a key initiative within a National 
 
Programme and Strategy for End of Life Care in England and 
Wales10. Then, in the face of mounting criticism and following 
a government requested national review, led by Baroness Julia 
 
Neuberger in 201311, it was abruptly discontinued. An extensive 
debate ensued, seeking to understand how this had happened and 
why the LCP had ‘failed’.
Our purpose in subjecting the LCP story to detailed scrutiny is 
to move beyond the positions so far seen in the literature. These 
 
polarise between simplistic and retrospective ‘blaming’ of its 
limitations, often from sources that had hitherto been silent on the 
 
matter; or on the other hand, regret for its demise. Both these 
 
tendencies are evident in the many published commentaries, 
 
particularly in the clinical literature after 201312,13. In contrast, we 
seek to provide a theoretically informed analysis of the rise and 
 
fall of the LCP and to conclude with comments that might be 
 
relevant to future policy and practice in the context of com-
plex health systems in which the character of terminal illness is 
 
undergoing significant change. We aim to answer the follow-
ing questions: 1) why and how did the LCP come to prominence 
as a vehicle of policy and practice 2) what factors contributed to 
its demise? 3) what immediate implications and lessons resulted 
 
from its withdrawal?
Background
Integrated care pathways
Integrated care pathways (Box 1) are complex interventions 
 
to enable the organization of health care for specific groups of 
patients, often in the context of time limited decision-making14. 
Their use commonly involves structured documents outlining 
essential steps in care to be followed by members of multidisci-
plinary teams involved with particular groups of patients. They 
can also be used to introduce clinical guidelines and to provide a 
 
framework for audit15. A key intent behind their use is to 
 
standardise or ‘rationalise’ care for a particular issue, problem 
or clinical care episode16,17, although their potential to enhance 
 
‘person’ centred care is also often emphasised, creating a degree of 
ambivalence about their core purpose18,19.

Integrated pathways can go by various names: critical pathways, 
clinical pathways, and case management plans14. Originating in 
the USA in the 1980s in the context of a ‘payment for service’ 
health care system, they were part of a wider movement to manage 
 
concerns about spiralling health care costs, whilst sustaining care 
quality and improvement. Their appearance in the United King-
dom (UK) in the 1990s, mirrored a ‘modernisation’ emphasis on 
clinical efficiency and a drive to ensure the application in everyday 
 
practice of standardised national guidelines20. The integrative 
focus of pathways refers to the intent to use them as a means of 
 
formalising multidisciplinary channels of communication and

 of enabling professionals to work together across disciplinary or 
 
care setting boundaries (for example in health and social care)21.
In a review of the evidence base behind integrated care pathways 
in stroke care, Allen and Rixson22 note the widely cited aims of 
integrated pathways within NHS discourse: ‘…the right peo-
ple, doing the right things, in the right order, at the right time, 
in the right place, with the right outcome’(p81). The reviewers 
 
conclude that integrated pathways in stroke care are potentially 
 
successful in the acute context, where the patient’s illness and 
care trajectory are reasonably predictable; however, their value in 
 
rehabilitative care, where recovery pathways are variable, is less 
clear. In a similar vein, Pinder et al19 describe how pathways 
‘abstract the patient and reify the condition’ (p765), creating a 
 
tendency to ‘….omit the plasticity of patients’ personal circum-
stances and lived experience, providing no map of the terrain 
 
that the ill person has to traverse’ (p775). In this sense, pathways 
can have a powerful influence on shaping practice and the way 
in which practitioners understand clinical issues, and the most 
 
appropriate response to them.
An early review of integrated care pathways published in the 
 
British Medical Journal in 199823 summarises them as ‘task 
 
oriented care plans’ offering not only the essential steps in 
 
patient care but also a structured means of implementing local 
 
protocols of care based on evidence based guidelines and analysing 
why care may fall short of, or vary from, any adopted standards.
In this context, the LCP was a clear example of an integrated 
 
care pathway which reflected all of these features, although as 
we will see, debate later emerged about the quality of evidence 
on which its key features were based and whether it was an effec-
tive in achieving its goals. Such issues were foreshadowed in an 
 
observation made from the 1998 review: ‘…despite the sound 
 
principles which underlie care pathways, few evaluations have 
been done of the cost of developing and implementing them 
 
and their effectiveness in changing practice and improving 
 
outcomes’23 (p133). 
‘Boundary objects’
A boundary object is an artefact that provides a means of 
 
sharing ideas, technologies and practices across and between 
organisational settings, cultures and communities24. The inter-
est in boundary objects reflects a concern to articulate the mean-
ings and perspectives of actors from a variety of ‘social worlds’ 
or ‘sites of difference’25. Originally conceptualised in 1989 by 
Star26 as ‘…objects which both inhabit several intersecting social 
 
worlds … and satisfy the informational requirements of each 
of them’ (p393), boundary objects were soon categorised along 
four dimensions: repositories, ideal types, maps and standardised 
 
forms8. Integrated care pathways have been described by Allen27 
as ‘classic examples’ (p305) of boundary objects because they 
 
straddle clinical, managerial and user interests. They are thus 
potentially associated with differing meanings across the particular 
groups involved.
Following Carlile’s28 definition of a successful boundary object 
as one which provides a shared language, allows concerns to 
be expressed and enhances knowledge, Fox29 has made the 
 
distinction between ‘positive’ and ‘negative’ boundary objects, 
each of which have consequences for the transformation of knowl-
edge and practice within a community. This highlights examples 
where implementation is able to proceed or to where it is blocked in 
 
some way. Both are important.
Boundary objects are therefore subjects of and for reinterpretation 
and renegotiation, often through a process of conflict, although 
 
their dynamic aspects have been somewhat neglected30. While 
boundary objects are capable of bridging different perspectives, 
they can be associated with negative unintended consequences 
 
resulting in inhibition of the very improvements they were 
 
intended to facilitate30. For Carlile, the production of knowledge 
across boundaries entails several activities: transfer (involving 
information and knowledge processing), translation (involving 
interpretation and the use of new information and knowledge), and 
transformation, which occurs when the interests of actors diverge, 
leading to power struggles over the legitimacy of the ‘object’ at 
hand28.
Methodological orientation
Building on the twin concepts of integrated care pathways and 
boundary objects, we set out to write a critical and histori-
cal account of the LCP, informed by relevant theory and thereby 
 
generating understanding that may inform future end of life 
 
interventions. We have made use solely of sources available in the 
public domain, namely:
1) Content emerging from the LCP programme – this includes 
 
guidance materials, LCP documentation, and writings concerned to 
support the use of the LCP.
2) Evidence from a spectrum of published studies on the use of 
the LCP – qualitative research and improvement project findings, 
 
surveys of practice and attitudes, clinical evaluations, and 
 
randomised trials.
3) Letters, articles, broadcasts, and online content found in the 
 
mass media and on social media.
4) Professional commentaries on the LCP, particularly those 
 
written in the aftermath of its withdrawal and published in 
 
clinical journals.
5) Content from and associated with the Neuberger report11 into the 
use and efficacy of the LCP.
We contend that these sources are sufficient to answer our three 
research questions. We acknowledge that other lines of enquiry 
about the LCP are still to be pursued, and that these would 
 
require other methods. For example, oral history interviews 
might be useful in assessing the rise and demise of the LCP from 
 
the personal perspectives of key actors involved in the wider 
 
processes we describe in this paper. We suggest that it may still 
be too early for such work to be conducted, as personal invest-
ments in the LCP, individual and organisational reputations, ques-
tions of anonymity, confidentiality, and other sensitivities may be

 sufficiently marked as to inhibit the successful conduct of such 
work. Primary and secondary sources in the public domain still 
offer much material for analysis however, and allow the short to 
medium term barriers that would arise from research involving 
human subjects, to be overcome.
History and development
The LCP was originally formulated during the 1990s at the 
 
Royal Liverpool University Hospitals NHS Trust and the Marie 
Curie Hospice in Liverpool and underwent incremental develop-
ment and revision over the next 15 years31. The LCP was subject to 
annual review by a multi-disciplinary steering group that included 
carer representation. Utilising the quality improvement methodol-
ogy of ‘Plan, do, study, act’ (PDSA)32, the LCP programme and 
documentation was updated and revised over time in response to 
feedback, with 12 versions published in total.
The LCP was focused on patients in the ‘dying phase’ (described 
as the last 48 hours of life in the original LCP documentation). 
 
Up to version 11, recognition of the dying phase was recommended 
to be the responsibility of the multi-professional team agreeing 
 
that the patient was dying and when at least two of the follow-
ing features were present: the patient is bedridden; the patient is 
 
semi-comatose; the patient is able to take only sips of fluids; the 
patient is no longer able to take tablets9. Following review of 
 
feedback by the multi-disciplinary steering group, version 12 
removed these features and replaced them with an algorithm to 
guide recognition of the dying phase.
Once established that the patient was entering the dying phase, 
the use of the LCP entailed the following four steps: initial assess-
ment; care planning against suggested ‘goals’ of care; ongoing 
 
assessment and care after death33. The documentation associ-
ated with the LCP was intended to replace all other medical and 
 
nursing notes in use and was designed to prompt and guide 
 
clinical decisions and interventions for the dying patient, in antici-
pation that it would aid good communication with family members 
and the patient, and improve the quality of end of life care34. It took 
the form of a ‘template’ for use by the various clinicians involved 
in a person’s care, addressing four domains of care: physical, 
 
psychological, social and spiritual35. It gave space to record 
clinical decisions and actions, together with prompts and guid-
ance on the different aspects of care required. These included: 
 
comfort measures, anticipatory prescribing of medications, discon-
tinuation of inappropriate interventions, and the psychological and 
 
spiritual/existential support of the patient and family35. An 
 
example of LCP documentation indicating initial assessment 
of the patient and addressing the first goal of care is provided in 
 
Supplementary File 1, drawing on the last generic version 12, 
 
published in 2009.
Perhaps in anticipation of the risk that the LCP could be seen as 
a set of instructions for care rather than a guide to individualised 
decision-making, the importance of ‘variance recording’ was 
emphasised (see Box 1). For example, in their text book about 
the LCP, Ellershaw and Wilkinson noted that variance recording 
 
in the context of integrated care pathways is:
 
…a mechanism by which a seemingly process driven 
 
approach to care can be tempered in line with individual 
patient need. The potential to use clinical skill and judgement 
 
to deviate from the suggested plan of care in response to an 
individual patient’s needs makes the LCP a more flexible and 
practical document. Variance recording tells the story of the 
patient’s journey and current condition35 (p17).
The context of the development of the LCP was twofold: first, 
recognition that NHS hospital care of the dying fell short of best 
practice as understood at the time, and second, a recognition 
that the shortfall in specialist palliative care resource in hospitals 
meant it was unrealistic to expect specialist palliative care teams 
to be involved with every patient9. The LCP was therefore about 
‘going to scale’ with an approach that had to date been limited in 
 
its availability.
Transfer
The Marie Curie Palliative Care Institute in Liverpool took the lead 
role in disseminating information about the LCP, through series 
of publications34,36–38 and a process of networking nationally and 
later internationally. The work was co-ordinated by a central LCP 
team and organised in a series of programmes or work streams. In a 
2005 publication Ellershaw and Murphy describe the extent of this 
 
enterprise and how it worked:
 
The LCP framework is now based at the Marie Curie Palliative 
Care Institute Liverpool and is focused on four programmes; 
these are non-cancer, bench marking, education and inter-
national. These four programmes are supported by an audit 
and a research team. The education programme for 2005 will 
 
incorporate 2500 health-care professionals. Five clinical 
champions and 13 clinical facilitators now support the central 
team in the education-spread programme. An annual national 
 
conference based on the theme of care of the dying acts as a 
focus for new developments and research in this field39 (p133).
The LCP had become a major enterprise with its own dissemi-
nation and transfer needs. There was a great deal to be done to 
 
inculcate LCP knowledge and capacity at a local level. The central 
team encouraged a six to 12 month local implementation process 
for the LCP, described by Murphy in 2003 as entailing ten steps 
(see Box 2). This later became known as the ‘Ten step continuous 
quality improvement programme’ or CQUIP and was described as 
occurring in four phases: induction, implementation, dissemination 
and sustainability40.

 Wider endorsement
In 2000, a National Cancer Plan41 was published by the 
 
government as part of its NHS modernisation programme, in which 
it was stated that one aim was to ‘improve the care of the dying 
to the level of the best’ (para 7.21). Implicit here was that such 
care, as delivered across hospitals and nursing homes, would be 
elevated to standards more typically found in the specialist settings 
of hospices and palliative care units. The following year, 2001, 
the LCP was recognised as good practice by an NHS ‘Beacon 
 
Programme’ launched in 1999 to identify services making sig-
nificant contributions to the modernisation initiative42. This was 
 
followed in due course by an announcement on the 26th December 
 
2003 that an NHS End-of-life Care Programme (later known 
 
as a National Programme and referred to here as ‘the Programme’) 
was to be established in early 2004 with funds of £12 million over 
three years to support the implementation of best practice in end 
of life care by widening the pool of trained staff43. The LCP was 
 
prominently identified by the Programme44 as one example of 
 
how this could be done, citing influential guidance published 
 
by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) in 200445 
(para 8.33).
In addition to the LCP, two other ‘tools’ were recommended by 
the Programme: the Gold Standards Framework, and Preferred 
 
Priorities for Care. The three ‘tools’ together quickly became 
the main focus of an implementation project, devolved to 28 
 
Strategic Health Authorities created by the government in 2002 in 
order to manage the NHS locally in England. For the Programme, 
the authorities were charged with identifying clinical priority 
groups and targeting care settings to work at local level. A small 
National Support Team, comprising a Programme Director and 
 
Programme Administrator was also established to support the 
 
SHAs for the duration of the Programme46. In an early report 
 
from the Progamme, the LCP is described thus:

The Liverpool Care Pathway for the Dying Patient (LCP) was 
developed to take the best of hospice care into hospitals and 
other settings. It is used to care for patients in the last days or 
hours of life once it is known that they are dying. The LCP 
involves prompting good communication with the patient 
and family, anticipatory planning including psychosocial and 
 
spiritual needs, symptom control (pain, agitation and res-
piratory tract secretions) and care after death. The LCP has 
 
accompanying symptom control guidelines and information 
leaflets for relatives44 (p2).
Use of the LCP received further high level endorsement in 
 
2005 from the National Council for Palliative Care, with publica-
tion of a ‘Palliative Care Manifesto’47 in which one of four key 
pledges was to to introduce monitoring of care of the dying as a 
key element of performance management for NHS organizations 
at board level. Ellershaw and Murphy39 note that, in addition, a 
 
report on cancer care from the National Audit Office48 highlighted 
the role of the LCP in the National End of Life Care Programme 
as a:

…means of integrating care for the dying by pulling 
 
together different professional groups and providing a frame-
work to help busy staff ensure the completeness of care 
 
procedures39 (p133).
Most notably, it was recommended by the landmark National 
 
End of Life Care Strategy, published in 2008:
 
….[Trusts are] strongly recommended to ensure that the 
 
LCP is adopted and its use audited in all locations where 
patients are likely to die10 (p 67).
By this point, the LCP as boundary object seems to have become 
firmly established: strategically, clinically, organisationally.
Translation
The LCP was not a fixed entity. It went through a series of 
 
revisions as its nationwide use began to quicken. Its first iteration 
was reported in 1997, in the European Journal of Palliative Care9 
and the final ‘generic’ version was issued (version 12) in Decem-
ber 2009. The latter followed two years of consultation across the 
 
sector by the Marie Curie Palliative Care Institute, examination 
of two rounds of national audit dataa 49,50 and consideration of 
 
criticisms that were by now emerging in the media about risks 
 
associated with the use of the LCP51. An associated ‘data diction-
ary’, perhaps seeking to reassure, provided detailed instructions 
about the use of the LCP to enable:
 
…explicit and robust understanding of the core meaning of 
each of the goals of care and the rationale, required behaviour 
and correct coding of information31 (p4).
National and locally produced documents associated with version 
12 also affirmed that:
 
…the responsibility for the use of the LCP generic document 
as part of a continuous quality improvement programme sits 
within the governance of an organisation and must be under-
pinned by a robust education and training programme52 (p4).
By 2011, the LCP had received endorsement in a series of policy 
documents, including a report on quality markers and measures 
in end of life care53 and in end of life care guidance issued by 
 
National Institute for Clinical Excellence45 and the General 
 
Medical Council54.
Peer reviewed evidence and a developing critique
As the LCP became ‘high profile’ in the policy arena of end 
 
of life care in the UK, and especially so in England, it began to 
receive more attention from the academic research community 
and to be studied in other countries (notably the Netherlands). A 
key research criticism was that the LCP lacked an under-pinning 
‘gold standard’ of evidence in the form of supporting data from 
 
randomised controlled trials (RCTs). The critique missed an 
important nuance: the LCP was styled quite explicitly as a qual-
ity improvement programme; something not usually associated 
with the more formalised approach of the RCT. This type of 
 
aThe audits were carried out by the Marie Curie Palliative Care Institute Liver-
pool (MCPCIL) in collaboration with the Royal College of Physicians (RCP) 
London, supported by Marie Curie Cancer Care and the National End of 
Life Care Programme at the Department of Health. In round 2, 155 hospitals 
from 114 Acute Hospital Trusts participated in the audit and submitted 3893 
 
patient data sets (Source: http://www.mcpcil.org.uk/media/16531/generic_
ncdah_2nd_round_final_report[1].pdf Accessed August 31st, 2017).

 criticism was voiced openly in 2005, with publication of a letter in 
the journal Age and Ageing by a hospice doctor from Kent, Shah55, 
lamenting the absence of large scale RCT data to support the LCP. 
Shah was writing in response to an earlier research letter pub-
lished in 2004 by Ellershaw’s team56 that reported descriptive data 
 
on use of the LCP on an acute stroke unit from a ‘before and 
 
after’ study of 20 clinical cases, which showed:
 
…marked improvement in levels of documentation, including 
a change in the prescribing of medication56 (p625).
In response, Shah raised the following criticisms:
 
The LCP appears to have a potential to improve some of 
 
the patient and carer-centred outcomes of good death, 
but it would be helpful to have some evidence. ... Current 
 
circumstances almost resemble a setting of a multi-centre 
 
randomised trial in regards to LCP implementation. In 
 
hospitals of different sizes and variable set-ups there are 
wards implementing LCP, and others that are not. It will be 
 
useful to compare the patient-, carer- and staff-related 
 
outcomes of care of dying in intervention (LCP) and control 
(conventional care of the dying in hospitals) groups before 
the LCP is rolled out to more wards and hospitals. If we miss 
 
this opportunity, we will end up with an untested LCP 
 
accepted as a gold standard everywhere. We will then be 
unable to test its efficacy, as ethical approval will almost be 
 
impossible55 (p197-8).
There is a reply to Shah by the LCP team in the same issue 
 
of Age and Ageing57, taking the line that the whole field of 
 
palliative care is evidence poor and also observing that the LCP is 
a template of care that:
 
… promotes the spread of the palliative care approach 
 
in the dying phase to members of the generic team. In this 
 
way, it has the potential to impact on the ‘culture’ of the 
 
delivery of care to dying patients in a way that a relatively 
small team of palliative care professionals … could probably 
never do (p198).
Over the next four years, Ellershaw and his team published a 
number of observational studies on the LCP broadly located 
within the quality improvement paradigm58–61 b. Over a similar time 
period, five Dutch papers were published reporting the results of 
 
non-controlled studies in the Netherlands62–66. Key findings are 
summarised below. In 2010 a Cochrane review was published: 
‘End-of-life care pathways for improving outcomes in caring 
 
for the dying’67 looking for evidence about the LCP from 
 
randomised controlled trials: it found no studies to include.
In 2008, a flurry of correspondence was published in the 
 
British Medical Journal (BMJ) about the LCP, which foreshad-
owed some of the criticisms that later emerged in the public sphere. 
The correspondence was prompted by a controversial article 
 
describing the practice of continuous deep sedation until death in 
the Netherlands68. It was initiated by Adrian Treloar, an old age 
 
psychiatrist in London, who accused the LCP of being ‘…the 
 
UK’s main clinical pathway of continuous deep sedation’ and 
voiced considerable doubts about its suitability for use among 
frail older patients because of the uncertainty of their typical 
 
dying trajectories. His letter prompted a robust response from 
Ellershaw, in an editorial seeking to correct ‘… dangerous 
 
misconceptions about the purpose and use of the LCP’69. Other 
letters in support of the LCP were also published70–72. Treloar 
 
subsequently apologised for his association of the LCP with 
continuous deep sedation73, but persisted with his critique of the 
 
suitability of its criteria of use for frail older patients. Various 
aspects of Treloar’s critique were supported by other correspond-
ents from geriatrics74, general practice75 and hospice care76–78. 
One contribution79 was from a retired British geriatrician, Gillian 
 
Craig, who was at that time the Vice Chair of the ‘pro-life’ Medi-
cal Ethics Alliancec. Craig supported Treloar’s original description 
of the LCP in relation to continuous deep sedation, and mirrored 
 
the content of her own opinion piece warning of the dangers of 
rolling out palliative care at scale, which had been published 
 
in the official journal of the American Academy of Hospice and 
Palliative Medicine80.
In 2011, an integrative review81, examined peer reviewed research 
about the LCP, published from November 2009 to April 2010. 
 
Articles were selected if an end-of-life care pathway was used to 
manage the dying phase in the acute care and/or hospice setting 
 
and if care delivered to dying patients and/or their families was 
evaluated. Articles were excluded if they reported a single case 
study or described process measures only. The review addressed 
five questions:
 
1) In which population(s) has the end-of-life care pathway 
 
predominately been used to manage care of the dying?
 
2) Is there evidence to support the end-of-life care pathway’s 
use in acute care and/or hospice systems?
 
3) What are the implications of these findings for evidence-
based care of the dying in the acute care and/or hospice 
 
setting?
 
4) What are the key elements underpinning effective 
 
implementation of the end-of-life care pathway?
 
5) What are the gaps in the evidence and future research 
 
directions?
No randomized controlled trials or meta-analyses were identi-
fied, although 26 studies of other typesd were included: 15 from 
the UK; four from the Netherlands; three from the USA; two from 
 
Australia and one each in Ireland and China. Phillips et al.81 
concluded that there was some low level evidence suggesting 
that: pathways promote good practice in end of life care; increase 
 
cAnecdotally, one of the authors (Seymour) recalls attending a conference 
 
hosted by the Marie Curie Institute of Palliative Care which was disrupted by 
 
a protest about the LCP from members of the Medical Ethics Alliance.

 accessibility in palliative care and promote better management 
of patient comfort. However, they observed a range of weak-
nesses of end of life care pathways from their review, including: a 
 
lack of association with palliative care approaches that are 
 
ideally in place before the dying phase and dependence of use 
upon timely recognition and diagnosis of dying in a context where 
 
only around 50% of deaths in acute care settings are predicted81.
Phillips et al.81 also provided evidence from several studies of 
 
pathway implementation, indicating that key factors for suc-
cessful implementation include: clinical education sessions and 
 
professionals with the necessary competences to use the pathway; 
strong clinical leadership; and the use of pathway ‘facilitators’. The 
criticality of facilitators to the safe use of the pathway for patients 
and the development of palliative care capacity amongst health 
 
care professionals was especially emphasised, though the review 
noted that there had been a decrease in the numbers of pathway 
facilitators in the UK over time:
 
The palliative care capabilities of the pathway facilita-
tor appear to be central to ensuring that the dying patient’s 
 
transition onto the pathway is appropriately negotiated and 
safely managed. The pathway facilitator also plays a key role 
in building the palliative care capacity of health professionals. 
Despite this positive relationship, the number of U.K. path-
way facilitators actually decreased over time, reflecting a trend 
to use facilitators for a defined period during the path-way 
 
implementation phase81 (p952).
In response to the growing disquiet over the LCP, Chan and 
 
Webster repeated their Cochrane review in 201382 but still found no 
evidence from randomised controlled trials, concluding that:
 
…with sustained concerns about the safety of the 
 
pathway implementation and the lack of available evidence 
on important patient and relative outcomes, recommendations 
 
for the use of end-of-life pathways in caring for the dying 
 
cannot be made82 (p1).
Transformation
The absence of ‘gold standard’ research evidence made it 
 
difficult to counter criticisms of the LCP that began to emerge 
beyond academia from 2009 onwards. Now more mainstream 
print media and the emerging power of social media were seen to 
 
combined effect as a range of ‘stakeholders’ colonised the LCP 
debate for a variety of political ends, ranging from ‘pro-life’ 
 
campaigners, to anti ‘Obama care’ activists in the USA. In 
 
between, the voices of people who had been bereaved also found 
a space. Many of these cited the LCP as a key factor in poor 
 
care, although others reported positive experiences of it.
A gathering ‘storm’
Thunder clouds associated with the LCP appeared in the wider 
public domain as early as September 2009 with the publication 
of a short but highly critical letter in the Daily Telegraph83 from 
six individuals, including: an emeritus professor of geriatric 
 
medicine, a consultant in palliative medicine, an anaesthetist, a 
lecturer and the Chairpersons of the Medical Ethics Alliancee and 
of ‘Choose Lifef’ (the latter both ‘pro-life’ organisations). The 
 
letter, which echoed concerns expressed in the clinical press by 
Craig a year earlier79,80, was published a week after the appearance 
of a report from the Patients Association84 estimating that up to 1 
million patients had received poor care in NHS hospitals, creating 
fertile ground for media and wider public interest. The authors of 
the letter noted the Patients Association report and immediately 
voiced their concerns that:
 
…a tick box approach to the management of death is caus-
ing a national crisis in care (and) …a nationwide wave of 
 
discontent … as family and friends witness the denial of 
 
food and fluids to patients83.
Further, the authors claimed that many deaths ‘come about’ as 
a result of terminal sedation, picking up on a wide misreporting 
 
in the media of research by the sociologist Clive Seale. 
In a paper presenting a case study of media reporting of 
his research on end of life decisions, Seale analysed how 
media accounts acted as a conduit for introducing new 
 
considerations in the public debate about end of life care beyond 
 
the narrower confines of assisted dying, hitherto the field of 
most interest to journalists, albeit using familiar techniques of 
 
simplification and polarisation85. Seale also notes that where 
 
something is considered to be ‘newsworthy’ (as was the case 
with the LCP ‘story’), a ‘feeding frenzy’ of ‘pack journalism’ can 
 
develop amongst the media85 (p2).
In the case of the LCP, a health correspondent in the Daily Tel-
egraph quickly picked up on the significance of the story and sub-
sequently ran a series of short reports, the first of which had the 
 
memorable title: ‘Sentenced to death on the NHS’86. It was 
 
sufficient to obscure the inclusion in the article of observations 
 
from a range of agencies in support of the LCP, including Marie 
Curie and the Department of Health. Other pieces quickly 
 
followed, usually taking the familiar form of personal stories - 
the first of these from a woman who claimed her father had been 
wrongly placed on the LCP87. A review of the correspondence 
 
in the Daily Telegraph undertaken subsequently by Mackintosh 
(2015) calculates that there were 431 individual comments in 
response to the original letter and the reports that followed88.
As Seale85 notes, the series of reports in the Daily Telegraph 
about the LCP, and especially the claim that sedation practices 
were causative of death, were picked up not only in the UK press 
but also in the USA by Lyndon Larouche, an American political 
 
activist who was opposed to what was widely known as ‘Obama 
Care’ (the Affordable Care Act):
eThe Medical Ethics Alliance is closely associated with Catholic ethics’ agen-
cies. Catholic doctors and hospital chaplains played a key role in the original 
 
and development of the LCP but others were centrally involved in the critique.

On Sept. 3, Britain’s Daily Telegraph published a lead arti-
cle featuring a Letter to the Editor from six prominent British 
 
doctors and health-care professionals, charging that large 
 
numbers of patients in the U.K. are being “sentenced to 
death,” by means of involuntary euthanasia. The numbers were 
 
stunning: According to a report from a researcher at Bart’s 
and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, one out 
 
of six people who died in the United Kingdom in 2007–08, 
died of continuous deep sedation, the mode of euthanasia 
which the doctors describe. As we present the evidence, you 
will see precisely what the Obama Administration has in 
 
store for the United States in its full Nazi form. Execu-
tive Intelligence Review (web-based). Sep 11th, 2009. 
www.larouchepub.com (published in Seale,85 p5-6)
In 2012 there was another flurry of reports and letters in the 
Daily Telegraph following a presentation on the 18th June 2012: 
 
“Is it possible to make a diagnosis of impending death? The 
 
scientific evidence” by Prof Patrick Pullicino (Prof of Neuro-
sciences, University of Kent) at a conference of the Medical 
 
Ethics Allianceg;h, in which he was highly critical of the LCP. 
 
Subsequently published in the Catholic Medical Quarterly89, 
his paper saw the LCP as a form of institutionalised euthanasiai. 
The Daily Mail quickly picked ups on Pullicino’s claims, and 
 
subsequently began a long running campaign against the LCP in 
articles with titles such as: ‘Care? No this is a pathway to killing 
people that doctors deem worthless’90.
Capitalising on the attention gained from reports of the talk by 
Pullicino, the authors of the 2009 letter to the Daily Telegraph, 
wrote again July 8th 2012, calling the LCP a ‘Deadly one way 
street’91. Soon afterwards, a letter to the Telegraph signed by over 
1,000 working doctors, nurses and carers took the opposing view 
and expressed support for the LCP as a dignified way to die92. The 
issues raised in the various print medium reports and letters also 
surfaced in social media.
A space opens in social media for the bereaved to give 
voice
The media furore opened up a space within which the complaints 
of bereaved people, rather than health professionals, about end 
of life care began to be noticed. The essence of these centred 
on awareness of their relative’s dying, lack of involvement in 
 
decision-making and poor quality of communication. The use at 
that time of comparatively new social media such as Facebook 
and Twitter enabled what might be seen as an essentially ‘grass 
 
roots’ movement to come to wider attention, and provided a means 
of networking between individuals and organisations. This in 
turn furnished the mainstream media with more material, includ-
ing reports or ‘think pieces’ published in the Guardian Society93, 
the Daily Mail90 and most other UK newspapers at regular inter-
vals between 2010–2012. Most were critical and used extreme 
 
language. For example, the Daily Mail used the term ‘Liver-
pool Killing Pathway’ and went on to erroneously claim that the 
 
LCP was implicated in the deaths of young babies and children: 
the latter report was the subject of a Press Complaints Inquiry 
and was reported in the BMJ94. Perhaps reflecting either an 
 
inability to gain newspaper publication or a fear of being misre-
ported, most commentators seeking to lend support to the LCP 
did so in the traditional medical and health care press, although 
 
many were also active on Twitter.
Some correspondents on social media apparently sought not only 
to air their complaints but also to ‘bring down’ the LCP. For exam-
ple, one Twitter hashtag @NHSNaziHuntersj echoed the language 
of the anti-government activist Lyndon Larouche reported earlier. 
 
As the wide ranging media activity peaked, it culminated in 
 
a petition by the organisation Change.org for a national enquiry, 
which took the form of an open letter to the Health Secretary 
 
of the United Kingdom governmentk.
A rising sense of risk
Controversy and criticism continued unabated in spite of efforts 
to lend support to the LCP by a range of organisations across the 
 
sectorl, and reiteration in a variety of policy and practice 
 
documents that the LCP:
 
…requires senior clinical decision making, communica-
tion, a management plan and regular reassessment. It is not a 
 
treatment in itself but a framework for managing treatment. 
It aims to support, but does not replace, clinical judgment. 
Communication, care and compassion must come from all 
 
the healthcare workers caring for an individual and their 
 
family95 (p17).

(Accessed July 12th 2017) by Dr Peter Berry posted on the 30th November 2012, 
Berry writes this:
My overriding objection to this paper centres on the use of the word 
 
euthanasia. It is suggested that widespread use of the LCP equates to insti-
tutionalised euthanasia, and implicit in this is an accusation that individual 
 
practitioners have killed their patients. To read this, as a doctor who has used 
the LCP, is very difficult. The accusation is made in the conclusion without 
any supporting evidence. The ‘evidence’ that is reviewed in the paper does not 
 
touch upon intentional killing. If we are regularly making inaccurate predic-
tions (or prognoses), that is of course unacceptable and must be addressed, 
but the term euthanasia suggests that we are intentionally killing our patients. 
There is absolutely no evidence for this. This paper, and the thoughts behind 
it, sparked a huge controversy over end of life care in this country. I think it is 
 
methodologically weak and structurally flawed. I think it contains baseless con-
clusions, and is excessively liberal with emotive, hurtful accusations of inten-
tional killing.

 In 2012 a report that half of all NHS trusts had received, or were 
due to receive, financial awards for demonstrating use of the path-
way under a system known as ‘Commissioning for Quality and 
 
Innovation’ (CQUIN), was cited in the Daily Telegraph as 
 
evidence of doubtful use of the LCP, and claiming undue 
 
financial and bureaucratic influence of individual clinical 
 
practice96.
In January 2013, two stories were run in the Daily Telegraph 
 
reporting that a national enquiry into the LCP has been com-
missioned by the Norman Lamb, MP, Minister of State for Care 
 
Support. The first cited an interview with Dr Bee Wee (then 
 
president of the Association for Palliative Medicine):
 
…some hospitals appeared to be treating the pathway as 
just another “thing to be done” rather than something to 
 
be handled with extreme care. She added that the cases which 
have come to light suggested that “packaging up” principles 
used in hospices for hospitals had caused difficulties. “There’s 
a very big difference in the culture of hospitals,” she said. 
“So the environment and the attention to training and support 
 
ongoing is an important point”97.
In the same article, Lamb, apparently capitulating to the growing 
storm, was reported as saying:
 
I have committed to appoint an independent chair to review 
how end of life care is working and oversee the reviews 
into the LCP. …This review will also consider the value of 
 
locally set incentives, and whether they are leading to bad 
 
decisions or practice97.
As a national independent review panel was convened, key 
 
elements in the controversy were distilled into the content of a 
Channel 4 television programme in February 2013 called ‘Death 
on the Wards’, in the investigative series ‘Dispatches’. This 
 
broadcast sought to establish the truth or otherwise about 
 
accusations in the media about the LCP. A month later a survey 
was published of 647 UK hospital doctors, jointly conducted by 
the BMJ and Channel 498, which found that critical reports of the 
LCP were negatively affecting its use. Many clinicians respond-
ing to the survey expressed concerns about distress caused to 
 
relatives of dying people by ‘scaremongering’ in the press about 
the LCP. Many were also anxious about how to respond. One 
 
respondent wrote this:
 
Negative press regarding LCP [the pathway] has caused 
 
additional distress for relatives at an already distressing time 
when their loved one is dying. This has caused a dilemma in 
judging if discussing the LCP will cause more distress than 
the benefit of being on the LCP for coordination of care 
 
in the dying phase98 (p18).
The survey enquired into doctors’ views about the accusation in 
the press that the LCP was used to ‘save money’99. The vast major-
ity of respondents (98%) did not think that resource considerations 
 
played a part in decisions to use the LCP, although most (58%) 
 
disagreed with the principle of using financial incentives pro-
vided to NHS Trusts for adoption of the LCP and other similar 
 
initiatives98.
The National Independent Review and its 
recommendations
The national independent review panel was chaired by Baroness 
Julia Neuberger and was given the brief of examining in detail 
the use and experience of the LCP in England and reporting its 
 
findings independently of the Government and the NHSm 11. The 
review panel comprised ten individuals including care campaign-
ers, a journalist, hospice and hospital leaders, a senior doctor 
 
and nurse, and an academicn. It met five times between February 
 
and June 2013 to consider a range of evidence, including: 
 
written submissions from health care professionals (n=91), 
 
members of the public (n=483), professional bodies and 
other organisations (n=36); a rapid review of research evi-
dence about the key components of integrated pathways in the 
dying phase of end of life careo 20; a snapshot review of hospital 
 
complaints and the results of the survey of health care profession-
als referred to earlier98. In addition, the panel met members of the 
 
public at four sessions. The review panel concluded from the 
 
evidence received that:
 
…where the LCP is used properly patients die a peaceful and 
dignified death. But the review panel is also convinced, from 
what it has heard and read, that implementation of the LCP 
 
is not infrequently associated with poor care11 (p7).
Overall, the panel made 44 recommendations, organised under 
25 themesp, of which the very large majority provide an agenda 
to improve the quality of care for dying people and their relatives 
 
that extends far beyond the scope and remit of the LCP as 
 
originally conceived, and which at the time of writing this paper 
were still being developed, discussed and disseminated. As 
 
mDetailed terms of reference can be found on page 50 of the report.

 well as proposals to cease reference to the LCP because of con-
fusion about the term ‘pathway’, the recommendations addressed 
deficiencies in: documentation; prognostication and diagnosis 
 
of dying; communication and clinical decision-making at the 
 
bedside (especially in relation to nursing practice surrounding clini-
cally assisted and oral hydration and nutrition, provision of pain 
relief and sedatives), consent; care planning; cardio-pulmonary 
 
resuscitation and other ethical issues. Wider aspects were 
 
also considered, including the quality of the environment of care 
and staff resources and equipment. Likewise, a proposal was 
 
made for a system-wide strategic approach to be adopted to 
 
improve care of the dying, building on the foundations of the 
 
End of Life Strategy published five years earlier in 200810, with 
 
end of life care incorporated into hospital inspections.
In the press releaseq accompanying the review, Baroness 
 
Neuberger stated that:
 
All the major players in the health and care system, includ-
ing the Government, need to do their part in reforming care 
for the dying, so that people everywhere can be sure they will 
be treated with respect and compassion, supported to die a 
 
peaceful, dignified death.
The panel concluded that use of the LCP should be phased 
 
out by July 2014, with the intention that it be replaced by a per-
sonalised ‘end of life care plan’ backed up by good practice guid-
ance specific to disease groups. Interim guidance to this effect 
 
was published for doctors and nurses on 16th July 2013 by NHS 
 
England100. On 15th August, and after the publication of the Neu-
berger report, BBC Radio 4 broadcast a 30 minute programme 
assessing the rise and demise of the LCP and its future implica-
tions. There were contributions from family members of patients 
 
who had been put on the LCP, as well as from palliative care 
 
specialists, including Professor Ellershaw101.
Aftermath
New guidance develops
The independent review panel primarily directed its recommen-
dations about the LCP to a range of national organisations with 
 
statutory or regulatory roles in health care (for example: NHS Eng-
land, Care Quality Commission, Department of Health, NICE; 
General Medical Council). In England, quite quickly after the 
publication of the independent review, representatives from these 
organisations together those from a range of others, including 
 
charities, formed a coalition of 21 known as the ‘Leadership 
 
alliance for the care of dying people’ (LACDP). The stated pur-
pose of the alliance was ‘…to take collective action to secure 
 
improvements in the consistency of care given in England to 
 
everyone in the last few hours or days of life and their 
 
families’102 para 3, with the following objectives: first, to support 
all those involved in the care of dying people to respond to the 
 
findings of the review; and second, to be the focal point for the 
system’s response to the findings and recommendations of 
 
the LCP review. The LACDP’s approach was to develop five 
 
‘priorities of care for the dying person’ (see Box 3).
Box 3. Priorities for care for the dying person published by the 
Leadership Alliance for the Care of the Dying Person in 2014101
The Priorities for Care are that, when it is thought that a person 
may die within the next few days or hours: 
1. This possibility is recognised and communicated clearly, 
decisions made and actions taken in accordance with the 
person’s needs and wishes, and these are regularly reviewed 
and decisions revised accordingly. 
2. Sensitive communication takes place between staff and the 
dying person, and those identified as important to them. 
3. The dying person, and those identified as important to them, 
are involved in decisions about treatment and care to the extent 
that the dying person wants. 
4. The needs of families and others identified as important to the 
dying person are actively explored, respected and met as far as 
possible. 
5. An individual plan of care, which includes food and drink, 
symptom control and psychological, social and spiritual support, 
is agreed, co-ordinated and delivered with compassion.
The priorities were worded to direct attention to the importance 
of individualised assessment and care planning, and away from 
 
the standardised approach that the review panel found had 
 
sometimes been adopted in the use of the LCP. The alliance 
emphasised that ‘…where change is needed, it is in the practice of 
 
particular local organisations and staff’102 (p7), with the role of 
national organisations to: ‘…require, encourage and support that 
change’102 (p7). In addition, Alliance members agreed and published 
a ‘commitment statement’, setting out their individual and collec-
tive approaches to improved care in the last hours and days of life. 
The following year an editorial published in the British Medical 
 
Bulletin by a leading palliative care doctor, Dr. Nigel Sykes, 
 
communicated the step change in shared responsibility for end of 
life care that he believed the Alliance’s report introduced:
 
…. doing the right clinical thing is no longer the sole 
 
responsibility of care providers. In addition, the role of con-
tracting and resources is recognized through an explicit 
 
expectation that Commissioners of care will share the respon-
sibility for effective end-of-life care, while previous training 
deficiencies are acknowledged through placing this respon-
sibility also with Commissioners of education and training 
 
as well as the medical and nursing Royal Colleges103 (p45).
A parallel process in Scotland, co-ordinated by the Liv-
ing and Dying Well National Advisory Groupr, resulted in the 
 
publication in December 2014 by NHS Scotland of a guide and 
set of four principles entitled ‘Caring for People in the Last Days 
 
and Hours of Life’104. It was designed to complement the

 broader ‘Scottish Palliative Care Guidelines’105 published in 
November 2014 by a multi-disciplinary group of professionals, 
public partners and in collaboration with the Scottish Partnership 
for Palliative Care and Health Improvement Scotland. In Wales, 
where an an integrated care pathway for the last days of life 
 
based on the LCP had been widely used, the All Wales End 
 
of Life Care Programme developed new guidance ‘Care Decisions 
for Last days of Life’ to incorporate the recommendations of the 
Neuberger and LACDP reports106.
The work of the LACDP in England was followed by the 
 
development and publication by NHS England of ‘Actions for 
End of Life Care 2014–2016’107, aimed at the care of adults and 
 
children, and the publication (in December 2015) by the National 
Institute of Clinical Excellence of a guideline on care of dying 
adults in the last 2 to 3 days of life108. The target audiences 
 
were health and social care professionals, commissioners and 
 
providers of care, as well as patients and their families/carers. 
The contextual overview of this document neatly summarises the 
 
largely agreed view on the LCP that had by now been reached:
 
Although the LCP was designed to bring values of good end 
of life care from the hospice movement to mainstream hospi-
tals and elsewhere, it met with increasing criticism from the 
 
public, health care professionals and the media. There were 3 
main areas of concern:
 
•    
recognising that a person was dying was not always 
supported by an experienced clinician and not reliably 
reviewed, even if the person may have had the potential 
to improve
 
•    
the dying person may have been unduly sedated as a 
result of injudiciously prescribed symptom control 
medicines
 
•    
the perception that hydration and some essential 
 
medicines may have been withheld or withdrawn, 
resulting in a negative effect on the dying person.
 
These were not necessarily a direct consequence of 
 
following the LCP, but often happened because of poor 
or indiscriminate implementation or a lack of staff 
 
training and supervision108 (p5).
 
As we will see below, the review of the LCP and the sub-
sequent questions of implementation and quality raised by 
 
NICE were much debated in the health care press, especially 
 
in the academic research journals related to palliative care.
Published commentaries and editorials: key themes
Following its withdrawal, a large number of editorials and com-
ment pieces were published on the theme of ‘what went wrong 
 
with the LCP’? Here three major themes were in evidence: 
 
1) the LCP as a iconic example of what happens when ‘gold standard’ 
 
evidence from randomised controlled trials is not gathered 
before adoption of a complex intervention; 2) the LCP as a failure 
 
of implementation rather than any fundamental problem in its 
 
formulation; and 3) the LCP as something misunderstood and 
 
abandoned without due cause.
Straddling the first two of these is an editorial in the BMJ by 
 
Sleeman and Collis about the LCP109:
 
Was this a failure of the paperwork or of its implementation? If 
implementation and training are key, would investment in these 
areas—rather than developing guidelines from scratch—be a 
more efficient use of resources? The lack of strong evidence 
of the LCP’s benefits undermines this argument. However, 
 
the converse is also true: the absence of prospective evidence 
of harm should caution us against the assumption that sim-
ply withdrawing the LCP will improve end of life care…. 
Ultimately, the decision to phase out the LCP was made on 
the basis of little more than an accumulation of anecdotal 
 
evidence. Without independent prospective evidence from 
 
controlled trials, the LCP became unusable. This should serve 
to warn us of the dangers of the national implementation of 
tools that are not properly evidence based109 (p7).
A year later and in similar voice, an editorial in the Lancet12 by 
Currow and Abernethy accompanying the publication110 of the 
 
first RCT of the LCP, asserts:
 
…the LCP was taken up by bureaucrats who did not under-
stand the implications of widespread implementation of 
 
an initiative for which the net effects were poorly defined … 
As demonstrated by the results of Costantini and colleagues’ 
study, a government, when introducing such initiatives, should 
properly assess them in rigorous trials of health services, 
 
preferably randomised; if this cannot be achieved then 
 
a formal prospective assessment of new interventions as 
they are implemented must be the minimum standard. Either 
 
assessment should be done in a health-care environment where 
new interventions are thoughtfully introduced, correspond-
ing data are routinely gathered for the interventions, and 
 
analyses inform understanding of the net benefit and 
 
opportunities for iterative enhancement—namely, a learning 
health system framework, as described by the US Institute of 
Medicine12 (p192).
The multicentre cluster randomized trial110 to which Currow and 
Abernethy’s editorial12 refers was carried out in Italian hospitals 
across 16 general medicine wards with at least 25 deaths from 
 
cancer annually, and involved 308 patients who died from can-
cer and their families. Although some commentators have argued 
that the study was underpowered15,109 and subject to bias for 
 
methodological reasons15, it was well designed and rigourous. 
It found no significant difference in overall rating of quality of 
care between patients who died in wards in which the LCP had 
been implemented when compared with those in which it had not, 
although improvements were observed in two out of 9 secondary 
outcomes (respect and control of breathlessness). No differences 
in survival or medication use were observed. The ‘take home’ 
 
message from the cluster trial was that any benefit derived from 
the LCP depends on the quality of its implementation. Since 
 
then, a cluster randomized trial of the ‘Care Programme in the 
 
Last Days of Life’ (CAREFul) has been conducted in the 
 
Netherlands, based on the LCP and taking account of its critique111, 
finding that the progamme improved nurse assessed comfort

 but not satisfaction with care among relatives. The authors 
 
conclude that further qualitative research is required to gain 
an understanding of this apparent discrepancy and recommend 
 
‘controlled implementation’ with due regard for ongoing training 
 
of clinicians especially in communication skills111 (p132).
A similar theme of implementation is picked up by the Ameri-
can authors Billings and Block in a review in the Journal of 
 
Palliative Medicine112 which noted that:
 
…the tragedy of the LCP lies in the gap between the appar-
ent value of its guidance for clinical care in the last few days 
 
of life and its performance in daily practice112 (p1493).
These commentators also draw four wider conclusions: first, 
that the Neuberger report itself may be criticized for not being a 
 
scientific study of the LCP and for relying too much on anec-
dote; second, that the LCP story has revealed serious deficiencies 
 
in the perception of palliative care in the UK; third, that it 
reveals serious deficiencies in care in NHS hospitals which go 
far beyond the scope of the LCP; and fourth, that engagement of 
 
anti-euthanasia groups clearly impacted on the reputation of the 
LCP.
Nor did political and media interest in the LCP disappear. When 
in late 2015 evidence was given to a Health Select Commit-
tee of MPs, confirming that thinly disguised versions of the LCP 
 
were in use in some settings despite the Neuberger recommen-
dations, the Daily Mail once again returned to the issue, this 
time condemning the ‘arrogance’ of doctors who were flying in 
 
the face of best practice113. Prominent figures in the palliative 
care world, including Professor Sam Ahmedzai, who chaired the 
 
NICE guidelines committee, were equally vocal in the 
 
condemnation. 
Discussion
Following 
Carlile’s28 
description 
of 
boundary 
object 
 
implementation as a process involving transfer, translation and 
transformation, we have shown how the LCP quickly assumed 
national prominence as a key means to deliver the goals of a 
National End of Life Care Strategy10. On entering the phase 
of transformation, it became a site of expression and a signi-
fier of difference around a range of domains that extended far 
 
beyond its original conceptualization as a guide for clinical 
staff caring for people at the end of life. It was some five years 
 
into the national roll-out of the LCP that a sense of public scan-
dal began to break. As Butler and Drakeford (2005) show 
 
in their analysis of scandals, it was not unusual that the public 
furore began with a letter to a broadsheet newspaper. Research on 
scandals in health and social welfare suggests that some indeed can 
 
be iconic in character, leading to a fundamental shift in 
 
public awareness and thinking. This can be positive for the wider 
 
issue at hand (care in the last days of life, care of the dying) 
 
if negative for the specific intervention in question (in this case 
the LCP). Scandals are socially constructed. Similar phenom-
ena may elicit different responses. As the scandal spiralled out-
wards the LCP came to signify ‘end of life care’ in its totality. 
Some of the arguments expressed were of much wider import and 
went well beyond the specific goals of the LCP. These included: 
1) clinical resourcing issues, with the LCP story exposing some 
 
fundamental fault lines in an over extended and under resourced 
NHS; 2) research, with the LCP becoming a platform for 
debates about the nature of the ‘evidence’ required to underpin 
 
innovations in health care generally and palliative care specifi-
cally; 3) the moral and ethical domain, with the LCP being used as 
 
a conduit of discord around what constitutes ‘good’ or ‘bad’ 
 
practice in care of the dying; and 4) the public and media domain, 
where the voice of bereaved people found expression, and the 
power of emergent social media in creating new knowledge and 
understandings became evident.
The transfer and translation of the LCP took placed in the 
 
context of a widespread and uncritical enthusiasm for integrated 
care pathways that was gathering momentum in many modern 
health systems in the early 2000s. The LCP caught the wave of 
this, but in her description of integrated pathways as classical 
examples of boundary objects, Allen27 (p355) notes that while they 
 
have a ‘strong cohesive power’ to appeal to a range of stakeholder 
group, their breadth of appeal also disguises tensions between 
 
different agendas and frames of reference. To this extent, the 
 
development and evolution of boundary objects such as the 
LCP must always be understood as a political process, with the 
 
resultant tools functioning as ‘embodied practices for routing 
patients through the system’17 not neutral mechanisms19. As we 
have illustrated, before the LCP came to the awareness of the wider 
media, it encapsulated an ambiguity shared with all other ‘path-
ways’, between standardisation and person centred care16. This 
ultimately undermined its core purpose of improving decisions 
 
for each individual patient’s care in spite of efforts by its 
 
promoters to build in safeguards against poor practice and the 
publication of version 12 in response to criticism. The problem 
of ambiguity was compounded by an inadequate focus in the 
wider NHS on clinicians’ underlying knowledge in palliative care 
 
principles and ethical approaches to end of life decision-making11. 
In a cogent discussion of this latter issue, an Australian palliative 
medicine specialist, Mackintosh, has observed:
 
…it was not so much about what was said in the LCP 
 
documentation as what was not said and brings to light the 
difficulties of end of life decision-making. Ticking two out 
of four boxes about symptoms that were not specific to the 
 
dying patient now seems a rather naive approach; diagnosing 
dying can be a complex process filled with uncertainties ... 
 
specialist palliative care teams make their decisions very 
 
carefully following all the safeguards contained within the 
LCP. Much of what is implicit in the practice of specialist 
 
palliative care was never made explicit; the V12 algorithm 
came too late ... the LCP has been accused of adopting a 'one 
size fits all' approach. However, this was not the case as a 
 
careful examination of the documentation will reveal. Instead 
the LCP was interpreted as being a 'one size fits all' tool to 
practitioners without the required skills to read between the 
lines88 (p651).
The LCP was understood by its designers to be a complex 
 
intervention and, as we have seen, for its implementation they 
recommended ongoing training and support of clinicians at an 
organisational level to be provided by expert facilitators. As the 
Page 13 of 24

 LCP was rolled out at scale, this aspect was weakened and the 
LCP began to be represented as a stand-alone documents, rather 
than a broad approach to care in which the documentation was 
merely one aspect. Lack of training, together with ambiguities 
and misunderstandings surrounding the LCP, were combined with 
rapidly increasing pressures on the workforce. Indeed the Review 
Panel observed ‘constant pressures on staff and that some find the 
workload unmanageable’11 (para 2.25), with hospitals in England 
 
running at 90% capacity rather than the 80% recommended for 
safety. The LCP story thereby highlighted an unpalatable truth 
of much broader significance: when healthcare workers are 
exhausted and overstretched, quality of care, communication and 
 
decision-making are compromised114. As other commentators 
 
have concluded: ‘…services that provide poor quality general care 
will undoubtedly provide very poor end-of-life care115 (p510).
As the LCP story unfolded, it became a conduit for debate 
 
about the proper epistemic foundations of innovation in health 
care (quality improvement versus evidence based medicine). 
 
The LCP was not originally underpinned by research evidence 
from RCTs, but was far from alone in this as an intervention in 
palliative care or in health care more generally. For example, 
 
there was no LCP-type reaction to the ‘Gold Standards 
 
Framework’116 or ‘Preferred Priorities of Care’117, which were 
 
similarly high profile boundary objects promoted by the National 
End of Life Care Programme, each lacking supporting evidence 
from RCTs. Moreover, Mackintosh88 has argued that the calls 
for better evidence in the LCP debate are misplaced ‘….since 
what is being measured is not the performance of the tool but the 
 
performance of the user’ (p651) . The RCT evidence that has since 
emerged from Italy118 and from the Netherlands111 powerfully 
 
draws attention to this point.
An essential characteristic of boundary objects described by Star 
is their interpretive flexibility119. Where over standardization 
occurs this works against the reflective use and local tailoring that 
 
enables boundary objects to be used effectively. In her presci-
ent case study of the ways in which integrated care pathways 
 
develop, Allen27 concludes that diversity rather than standardi-
zation should be encouraged, thereby ensuring their utility for 
 
different purposes and contexts:
 
They should not be treated as pre-fabricated tools that 
 
supposedly can be easily transferred from one context to 
another. Furthermore, it is not sufficient to introduce a 
 
boundary object and wait for it to do its magic. The local 
 
process of making, introducing and using care pathways 
is crucial for making them work as boundary objects and 
 
continuous work is needed to sustain them27 (p 648).
It is well known that boundary objects need to be accompanied 
by the involvement of ‘knowledge brokers’ to enable translation 
 
into practice120. This was something recommended by the 
Marie Curie Palliative Care Team in their recommendations for 
 
implementation (albeit using different terminology)121, and high-
lighted in the conclusions drawn from the results of the randomised 
controlled trial of the LCP in Italy110. Knowledge brokers were 
 
also found to be critical to the success of the wider National 
 
End of Life Care Programme in an evaluation of its first phase46. 
Wenger describes such brokerage as a ‘… process of transla-
tion, co-ordination and alignment between perspectives. It also 
 
requires the ability to link practices by facilitating transactions 
between them’122 (p38). Following its withdrawal in England, a 
study in the Netherlands123 on barriers and facilitators to implemen-
tation of the LCP reported on the importance of skilled and ongoing 
 
facilitation, as well as ongoing training for the continuous 
 
development of competence in palliative and end of life care 
in the workforce. Similarly, a review by McConnell et al.124 
examining what hindered the implementation of the LCP showed 
that successful interventions are configured to address and 
 
influence the understandings of staff about end of life care and to 
increase their motivation and self–efficacy, and highlighted the 
support of senior managers as essential, both to release necessary 
resources and to enable culture change in organisations.
Integrated care pathways are simultaneously work flow models 
 
and records of care27. They are both management and clinical tools. 
As Allen27 demonstrates, they also appeal to two distinct but related 
logics within the health care system. Pathways are about evi-
dence based practice as well as quality improvement. If the former 
 
suggests scientific knowledge that is slow to accumulate and 
 
problematic to implement, the latter promotes local initia-
tives, quick implementation, adaptation and rapid feedback into 
 
practice. The LCP embodied these tensions. The formal evidence 
from a randomised control trial that brought its efficacy into 
 
question did not come until after major concerns had led to 
 
recommendations for its withdrawal. At the local level however, 
 
LCP was subject to annual scrutiny by a multi-disciplinary 
 
steering group that included carer representation and over time it 
moved through a series of revisions and numbered versions. Its 
 
‘roll out’ was therefore the product of quality improvement 
 
enthusiasms at local level which were quickly scaled up. In 
this LCP can be seen as a positive ‘boundary object’ with the 
 
potential to enrol clinicians, managers, service users and indeed 
wider publics in the common aim of improving care of the 
 
dying. When this broke down however, LCP was transformed 
into a negative boundary object, which served to highlight not 
 
shared enrolment, but rather fundamental conflicts of view. 
The LCP is not alone in this. As Allen’s studies show22,27, other 
 
pathways have undergone this transition – and have been quietly 
 
abandoned in the process before a crisis occurred. The LCP 
 
however was unusual in becoming high profile. It was not 
 
obscured within the complexities of daily clinical practice, but 
rather was championed as the diffusion of hospice principles to 
sFor example, the Independent Review of the LCP (paragraph 1.15) notes that 
the Department of Health’s End of Life Care Strategy used wording which 
 
contributed to this impression.

 meet the needs of the majority rather than the few. It was heralded 
as a transformative intervention to improve system-wide terminal 
care. Although its protagonists were always careful to emphasise 
that the LCP was only as good as the skills of those using it, the 
LCP, as it quickly rolled out, ran ahead of these skills124,125.
Hendy and Barlow126 have shown that organisational champi-
ons can be highly effective in the initial phases of health system 
 
innovation, when change is contained within distinct sub-sets of 
practice. But they caution against change being positioned in the 
hands of too few individuals, which may prove detrimental to 
 
wider implementation. The LCP may have suffered from this 
 
problem. It might also be argued that the relevant champions 
lacked foresight. In environmental areas it has become routine 
 
to practice ‘responsible innovation’127, acknowledging that innova-
tion can raise questions and dilemmas, is often ambiguous in its 
purposes and motivations and can be unpredictable in its effects, 
beneficial or otherwise. The approach operates on four princi-
ples of: 1) anticipating impacts, intended or not 2) reflecting on 
 
potential motivations, uncertainties, framings, dilemmas and 
 
transformations that might ensue 3) engaging in dialogue 
and debate about these issues in an inclusive way 4) acting to 
 
influence the direction and trajectory of the innovation process. 
Such principles could map fairly easily onto the LCP narrative, 
but were largely absent in practice. In a related way, Greenhalgh 
and colleagues128 have published a framework for understanding 
 
abandonment and challenges to the scale up of health and care 
 
technologies. They show that innovations that fail to address 
 
complexity across 7 specific domains are unlikely to be sustainable: 
 
(i) nature of illness and co-morbidities; ii) material features 
of the technology and knowledge needed to use it; iii) values 
 
(including efficacy, safety and cost-effectiveness); iv) adopters 
(including staff roles and practices); v)organisation (organisational 
readiness to adopt and implement); vi)wider system (considera-
tion of professional and stakeholder perspectives) and vii) scope 
for embedding and adaptation over time. As our account shows, 
 
several of these factors are relevant to the rise and fall of the 
 
LCP.
The sequence of events surrounding the LCP brought to an 
 
end the era of ‘unconditional regard’3 for palliative care. No longer 
could it be assumed that palliative care was universally welcomed. 
The LCP exposed ‘sites of difference’ upon which the goals of 
care and methods of care at the end of life were opened up to wide 
 
scrutiny. The ramifications seem not yet to have been fully 
 
acknowledged by those involved.
Conclusion
We set out to answer three sets of questions: 1) why and how did the 
LCP come to prominence as a vehicle of policy and practice 2) what 
factors contributed to its demise? 3) what immediate implications 
and lessons resulted from its withdrawal?
The LCP emerged in response to a clear need for ‘scaled up’ 
approaches to care interventions at the end of life. The case 
in the late 1990s was compelling. The available provision of 
 
palliative care through hospices and specialist palliative care units in 
 
hospitals was clearly incommensurate with the prevailing level 
of need for such services and the number of people who could 
benefit from them. This was therefore addressed through the 
 
development of a mechanism that fitted with then current enthu-
siasms for integrated care pathways and which could bring 
some of the essentials of palliative care practice to a wide range 
 
of beneficiaries. The initial success of the approach, what might 
be called the period of the LCP as successful boundary object, can 
be measured by the traction that it gained in its roll out and in the 
early results from local and service improvement studies. This was 
based on successful involvement from a number of stakeholders 
– across health care disciplines, hospital management and serv-
ice users. Such an approach resonated strongly at that time with 
 
a predisposing climate of policy interest in the provision of 
 
multi-disciplinary end of life care and a strategic commitment 
to support the transfer of successes seen in the British hospice 
 
context, into the wider health and social care system.
The factors that contributed to the demise of the LCP in turn relate 
to how it then broke down as a boundary object. The LCP needed 
 
constant cultivation by knowledge brokers if it was to hold 
 
together and sustain the engagement of disparate stakeholders. 
Where this faltered, the default position was one of mechanistic 
and potentially insensitive implementation of the LCP as a protocol 
 
or checklist. It then became the site of conflicts provoked by 
 
ideologically inspired interest groups, both within and beyond 
the healthcare environment, which fostered a previously unseen 
 
critique of certain assumptions within the palliative care paradigm. 
 
This found its correlates in the media and wider expressions 
 
of public concern. As these grew, the LCP became the bearer of 
responsibility for all aspects of NHS end of life care, well beyond 
its original remit, goals and aspirations.
Meanwhile, palliative care experts were slow to respond to 
 
these concerns, or to develop evidence about the LCP in relation 
to which they could be judged. Instead their contributions only 
emerged with any significance in the aftermath of withdrawal 
when some hastened to publish their thoughts. The contributions 
 
polarised between those who had ‘always’ had reservations about 
the LCP and those who saw its demise as a matter of regret and who 
in turn challenged the critics to present a better alternative. The five 
‘priorities of care for the dying person’ developed by the LACDP 
and the subsequent NICE guidance, with its flimsy evidence 
 
base, were long on values and aspirations, but short on a 
 
practical course of action. They replaced one set of deficiencies 
with another.
On the available evidence and within the limits of our chosen 
method here, we judge that the LCP boundary object was well 
conceived, but not matched by sufficient subtlety and foresight 
in its implementation and dissemination. The dramatic demise, 
when it came, resulted from a combination of media-fuelled pub-
lic criticism and long-delayed professional judgement, hitherto 
never experienced in the developing field of palliative and end 
 
of life care. The most important lesson that can be learned 
 
however is not about the dangers of scaling up clinical interven-
tions that lack an ‘evidence base’. Rather it is about the need for

 greater assessment of the wider risks involved and more careful 
consideration of the unintended consequences that might result 
from a given course of action – especially in the politically and 
morally charged arena of end of life care interventions.

In this thoughtful and illuminating article, Professors Seymour and Clark critically analyse the rise, demise
and legacy of the Liverpool Care Pathway (LCP), using the sociological concept of “boundary objects”. A
boundary object occupies multiple social worlds and enables communication between them, making this
a good conceptual fit to the LCP, which was an integrated care pathway that sought to straddle various
clinical, managerial and “user” interests.
The use of the boundary objects metaphor is instructive and the authors (commendably) clearly marshal
and convey a diverse range of evidence from the literature. The authors take a literature-based approach,
in part because qualitative work (e.g. interviewing key participants and stakeholders) would likely be
premature. This seems plausible, although future such work would no doubt be welcome. It might have
been useful to hear a little more about how the authors designed their (systematic?) review, but this
certainly appears to be a thorough review, which successfully traces the history of the LCP and highlights
the key themes surrounding the LCP that one might expect to encounter.
Numerous overlapping themes emerge: striking a balance between individualised (person-centred) care
and standardised care; the nature and use of evidence in supporting or discrediting health interventions
(and, indeed, in policy-making); translating theory into practice, through appropriate education, support
and dissemination; and the respective roles of process and judgment when designing and delivering care.
Many of the themes will resonate beyond the LCP and the authors do engage with some (important)
broader themes, such as the role of care pathways, funding of and in the UK’s National Health Service,
and perceptions of palliative and end of life care more generally. Some such themes might even have
been pushed further e.g. in spurring national discussions about death and dying, might the LCP’s demise
be associated with an oft-reported reluctance to openly confront these difficult matters? However, the
authors’ reflections appear to be carefully evidence-based. Indeed, the evidential issues surrounding the
LCP were notable throughout their article: I was particularly struck by the sense that the sort of evidence
that was judged problematically to underpin the LCP – this being “soft”, less than “gold standard”,
evidence – was precisely the sort of evidence then used to discredit it, and to underpin its review and
subsequent removal. The sort of hard evidence sought by some critics was later collected, but I was left
pondering the sort of evidence best suited to this complex, uncertain context (indeed, uncertainty might
be another theme associated with the LCP, as the authors acknowledge early in their article).

be another theme associated with the LCP, as the authors acknowledge early in their article).
In discussing the themes that they found, the authors display a sure grasp of context and history. Some
elements could have been explained a little further, especially for non-UK audiences and for those less
familiar with navigating the (potentially bewildering) health policy landscape. As other reviewers also
comment, examples include the references to the Gold Standard Framework, Preferred Priorities of Care,
End of Life Care Strategy, and to bodies like the National Council for Palliative Care (which has since
merged with Hospice UK). There are also very occasional – and very mild – typographical errors.
However, none of this should detract from the value of this important article. The authors display insight
and balance throughout and this article should become a go-to piece for anyone wishing to explore the
LCP and, more generally, the promise and pitfalls of using pathways and making policy in healthcare.

We thank Professor Huxtable for his insightful review. Work is underway to collect interview data
from key stakeholders involved in the international application of the LCP in a follow on project.
The latter will provide us with an opportunity to consider some of the important issues raised in this
review, such as the relationship between palliative care policy and wider societal perceptions of
end of life care, and the type of ‘evidence’ required to underpin innovations in palliative care. We

The story of success and subsequent controversy surrounding the Liverpool Care Pathway for the dying
(LCP) in United Kingdom is widely known internationally. However, it may not be clear to an international
audience just what this story is based on, although it is highly relevant. For this reason, we commend the
analysis put forward by Drs Jane Seymour and David Clark. Their historical analysis of publicly available
information sources about LCP in Britain is important and contributes by combining critical analysis with a
data- and theory-informed understanding of what contributed to the widespread use and implementation
of this clinical pathway, how it could rapidly be adopted as a policy, and then legally advised against.
Nevertheless, having discussed the presentation of the LCP conflict by the authors in the background, we
find the introductory perspective to be somewhat less distanced than the rest of the article.
 
The study is contextualized to the global spread of palliative care and how it has evolved as a response to
challenges in the population, while the analysis focuses on LCP on the UK scene. International readers
might benefit from having British palliative care put in context, within the responsibility of the NHS on the
one hand and wider society – and maybe communities – on the other. This particularly surfaces in the
analysis, where the authors clarify that, at the same time as the LCP, the ‘Gold Standards Framework’ and
the ‘Preferred Priorities for Care’ were also implemented. How these three tools were related is not
explicated, however. All three are mentioned, but it remains unclear to what extent, if at all, these latter
tools were part of the LCP discourse, and if so, in what way.
 
The theoretical lens of ‘boundary objects’ which is used in the study appears to have a practical fit. In our
interpretation, the lens articulates – and demarcates – an understanding of the study object that could
range along opposites poles in a continuum from considered negative to positive, which is related to
negotiations, renegotiations and conflicts as reflected in the swings of the pendulum appearing in the
history of the LCP. Moreover, the perspective could help shed light on how different perspectives could
be bridged and also on unintended consequences, which were clearly related to the implementation of
the LCP. However, the article does not make clear what aspects might have been left out in the analysis.
This would have been useful, especially for international readers who are not knowledgeable of the details
in the British context. Moreover, the discussion section does little to go back or problematize from the
view point of this framework.

view point of this framework.
A fairly unsurprising but still important result of the analysis is the fact that the tool itself cannot be blamed
for poor quality of care. Thus, the analysis explicates the importance of considering what a practice tool
involves (e.g. as related to underpinnings, reliability, usefulness and so forth) and the driving forces for
implementation and diffusion of the tool. After independently reading the article and then discussing it, we
became unsure as to how the whole controversy were handled by the media – could this have been more
explicated and problematized in the analysis? This also raises the question of whether the NHS makes
room for self-criticism (i.e. allows sufficient implementation and follow-up procedure, and a workable
structure, resources and competence of care etc.).
On the whole, we find this analysis complete and important, both for practice and research as related to
palliative care practice and policy development and, of course, especially for knowledge translation or
dissemination. In our view, the significance of the analysis is that it shows how critical it is to have an
informed understanding of the not only the development of innovative practice support tools, but
moreover of complexities and the diversity of stakeholders involved in their dissemination, and that both
innovative development processes and implementation processes do not only happen in discourses of
evidenced-based practice. Over simplified conclusions of problems related to the use of several practice
tools in palliative care, such as the LCP, are either that the tool has sufficient evidence or that the tool in
itself is dangerous or disconcerts wellbeing for patients and/or their informal carers. Furthermore, the
analysis of the LCP case shows that a tool can be both recommended and promoted despite lacking
support from significant evidence gatekeepers such as Cochrane reviews. Rather, the analysis by
Seymour and Clark clarifies the need for practitioners to take action based on their practical wisdom and
not only rely on tools, as well as the merits of considering unintended consequences related to the use of
tools. At least from our Scandinavian perspective we could learn from the LCP lesson, and without doubts
Seymour & Clark’s analysis contributes to a more in-depth and critical understanding than previous
national reports from the UK on the use and recommendations of LCP.

We thank Professor Öhlen and Dr Håkanson for their thoughtful and helpful review. We accept
their view that the some aspects of the paper (especially the relationship between the three ‘tools’ )
may be challenging for an international audience unfamiliar with the UK context, but hope that the
small clarifications we have now made to the paper go some way to addressing this.  We anticipate
making further use of the boundary object concept in a follow on study examining the international
spread of the LCP, and so their observation that we could perhaps have made further interpretive
use of the latter in this paper is valuable to us as we embark on that new project. The observations
about what may have been left out of the analysis and whether we could have provided an
expanded account to the role of the media are well made. It was challenging to weave together a
coherent narrative about a very complex affair and we have tried to be balanced in our use of
sources. We hope that the paper will encourage others to take a similarly ‘forensic’ approach to
examining the many aspects of this important phenomenon in palliative care history.

Congratulations on a magnificent piece of work.
I've never seen such a comprehensive or dispassionate account of the affair. You have definitely moved
the debate up several notches. The boundary object concept is very helpful and has implications for
service design programmes.  
I am thinking about how the industrial origins of ICPs, following something like the Toyota method may
have laid the foundations for the failure of the LCP as a boundary object in the world of NHS palliative care.
When the object of the original method is standardisation and its users are healthcare professionals, it
would have required additional work to allow a common language with families. The criticisms of the LCP
system seem to have come mostly from families who do not share the professional's view of the illness as
terminal, as well as some who see the care the LCP as an aberration when compared to previous care. It is
possible that the lack of continuity from previous care, privileging care of the "dying phase" over continuing
care of the individual was its downfall.
The GSF had different, perhaps scriptural origins, with its list of 6 commandments, later incorporating the
LCP as a 7th. It was designed within general practice, following consultation with primary care teams and

LCP as a 7th. It was designed within general practice, following consultation with primary care teams and
has always chimed well with patients and families. It apparently changed organisation and practice within
primary care and did not attract the problems of the hospital version of the LCP. Although the paperwork
made it rather cumbersome, it was adopted much faster than the LCP, and without the
institutional coercion, at least this side of the Scottish border. Work on the GSF always identified the need
for facilitation and support.
Also, your call for consideration of wider risks etc is well put. We might ask why this did not happen as it
should have done when such a clinical practice replaces another. The complex system of clinical
governance and risk registration in NHS hospitals, that should have overseen its application, must have
been circumvented by the way it was imposed on NHS Trusts. 
Another aspect of the story might be that it represents a failure, in professional terms, of my medical
specialty. I include myself in this as a naysayer, too much influenced by the politics of influence and
decisions taken further up the NHS. At the time, I lacked the evidence or the motivation to engage properly
with local implementation of the LCP, commenting that effort should be expended further upstream of the
last 48 hours.
I would only take issue with you that your call contrasts with other observers. Your cll for consideration of
risk before implementation would have been informed by interventional studies. A useful evidence base
will always elucidate unintended consequences, including those that none predicted before
implementation. RCTs might be slow, but might have precluded the LCP's mass implementation. Another
analysis might conclude that the PDSA cycle enabled the LCP to dodge its own coffin for 20 years!

Thank you Professors Seymour and Clark for this highly accessible, analytical history and critical analysis
of the Liverpool Care Pathway.  I found it thoughtful and thought provoking. At times uncomfortable
reading, at other moments providing a different perspective. I believe this will be a seminal reference for
the future.
I guess my main observation and question is making sure we move from rhetoric to practice in terms of
reflections and lessons learnt, pragmatically respond rather than react to the ever changing
communications and technological landscape as well as combine an attitude to care and practice that
embraces the generation of  robust evidence and translation of knowledge into the real world practice
which has every day meaning for patients, families and the community within which we live (and die) in.
Thank you for providing a useful and significant contribution to the debate, analysis and knowledge arena.
